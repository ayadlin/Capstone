Race-Specific Features and Outcomes of Nodular
Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma: Analysis
of the National Cancer Data Base
Adam J. Olszewski, MD1,2; Rajesh Shrestha, MD2; and Nathaniel M. Cook, MD3

BACKGROUND: The incidence of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is higher among African Americans
than among other races, but to the authors’ knowledge, the characteristics of NLPHL in this population have not been evaluated. The
authors compared clinical features, treatments, and survival of black and white patients with NLPHL using the National Cancer Data
Base. METHODS: The authors extracted the records of 602 black and 1950 white patients with NLPHL who were diagnosed between
1998 and 2011. Overall survival (OS) was compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Black patients were on average younger than
white patients (median age, 42 years vs 45 years; P 5.0001), more often female (49% vs 29%; P<.0001), and more likely to have the
axillary lymph nodes as the primary disease site (25% vs 17%; P 5.0002). They also had unfavorable socioeconomic characteristics, a
higher rate of no treatment in patients with early-stage disease, and a longer time to therapy initiation (median, 53.5 days vs 47 days;
P<.0001). Despite this, the authors found no significant difference between the races with regard to stage distribution or survival
(P 5.39). OS at 7 years was 90.1% in patients with early-stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IA/B, IIA) and 79.4% in
patients with advanced stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IIB, III/IV) NLPHL. Survival in the early stage of disease
was not found to be significantly different after various treatment strategies (stratified log-rank P 5 .18), except that the administration of chemotherapy was associated with a better outcome in black patients (log-rank P 5.011 vs P 5.81 for white patients).
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in clinical presentation suggest the interaction of race-specific and sex-specific susceptibility factors for
NLPHL. Further research is needed to elucidate these factors, and to investigate possible heterogeneous effects of treatments by
race. Clinical trials comparing standard treatment strategies are unlikely to detect differences in OS among patients with early-stage

INTRODUCTION
Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is an uncommon, biologically distinct subtype of
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), accounting for approximately 5% of cases.1 It is characterized histologically by the presence of
CD15-negative and usually CD30-negative, but CD20-positive, neoplastic lymphocytic and histiocytic cells.2 Clinically,
NLPHL is notable for an indolent clinical course with a high rate of durable remissions, but also for frequent late recurrences and histologic transformations to non-HL.3-5 For unknown reasons, the incidence of NLPHL among African
Americans is nearly twice as high as in the white population.6,7 However, to our knowledge, data are lacking regarding specific features of the disease in black patients because prior studies were based on predominantly white cohorts from Europe
or Canada and could not evaluate race as a variable.2,8-12 There are also no data regarding treatment patterns and associated outcomes of NLPHL in the United States. Treatment guidelines are largely based on the extrapolation of data from
classic HL or retrospective case series, with to our knowledge only a few clinical trials dedicated specifically to
NLPHL.13,14 The objective of the current study was to compare baseline characteristics, treatment patterns, and survival
among black and white Americans with NLPHL using data from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a retrospective study of NLPHL cases
reported to the NCDB between 1998 and 2011. The
study used deidentified data and was exempt from human
protection oversight by the Institutional Review Board.
The NCDB is a joint project of the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society. It collects cancer registry data from
>1500 facilities in the United States and Puerto Rico,
capturing approximately 70% of all incident malignancies
in the United States.15 The Commission on Cancer accreditation requires from the affiliated programs a 90%
annual follow-up rate for all eligible cases diagnosed
within 5 years. The NCDB contains information regarding clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of
patients, histology, stage of disease, presence of Bsymptoms, and primary site of the malignancy, as well as
information concerning the first course of treatment,
defined as all modalities of treatment recorded in the
treatment plan and administered to the patient before disease progression or recurrence. Treatments delivered or
withheld because of disease progression, insufficient
response, or other therapy modifications caused by further
clinical course are not recorded. Details regarding radiotherapy administration are collected, but specific chemotherapy regimens, doses, or treatment duration are not.
The NCDB has been used extensively to study the epidemiology and health outcomes of lymphomas in the
United States.16,17
Of the 79,963 cases of HL in the database, we
excluded those without histologic confirmation; those with
recorded human immunodeficiency virus infection; or those
cases treated outside of the reporting facility, for whom
treatment and outcome data were not consistently collected
(Fig. 1). We also excluded patients with NLPHL who were
of Asian (40 patients), American Indian (<10 patients), or
unrecorded (67 patients) race, because their numbers were
too small for meaningful comparisons. NLPHL was identified by the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition histology code 9659/3, according to the
International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium
(InterLymph) hierarchical classification of lymphoid neoplasms for epidemiologic research.18 Stage was categorized
as early (stage IA/B or IIA) or advanced (stage IIB, III, or
IV) according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer
staging system.19 Socioeconomic status was approximated
as the quintile of median household income in the patient’s
census tract of residence. In addition, state-subsidized
(Medicaid) health insurance or lack of insurance indicated
poor individual socioeconomic status.

Cancer Data Base (NCDB) is shown. HIV indicates human immunodeficiency virus.

Percentages were compared using the 2-sided chisquare test, and overall survival (OS) was compared using
the log-rank test. We calculated relative survival (RS) as a
proxy for disease-specific survival, using the method of
Perme et al.20 RS is the ratio of observed survival to survival expected in the general population matched by age,
sex, race, and calendar year.21 OS and RS were also evaluated in multivariable flexible parametric models on a
proportional hazards scale. Yearly trends were evaluated
by log-binomial regression and expressed as the annual
percent change (APC). All confidence intervals were set at
95% (95% CI) and statistical significance was considered
at an alpha level of <.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata/SE statistical software (version 13.1;
StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex) with the strs module
for estimating relative survival (version 1.3.9; P. Dickman, E. Coviello and M. Hills, available from http://

classic HL; P<.00001), and demonstrated several distinct
characteristics (Table 1). The 2.5-times male predominance typical of NLPHL was absent in black patients,
with a male-to-female ratio of 1.0 observed in this cohort.
Furthermore, black patients were on average younger, and
although age distribution was similar among black men,
white men, and black women (73%, 65%, and 65% of
individuals, respectively, aged <50 years), it was skewed
toward the postmenopausal range among white women
(only 44% of individuals were aged <50 years). (Fig. 2a).
NLPHL usually arose from peripheral lymph nodes, and
black patients were significantly more likely to present
with an axillary primary site of disease (up to 35.2% in the
subgroup with stage I disease). These differences were not
3474

observed among patients with classic HL, among whom
the percentages of black and white men and black and
white women who were aged <50 years were 75%, 64%,
75%, and 66%, respectively; the male-to-female ratio was
1.02 for black patients and 1.14 for white patients; and an
axillary primary site of disease was rare overall (6.5% and
4.7%, respectively, for black and white patients).
Despite significant socioeconomic disparities,
including a higher percentage of black patients with Medicaid or without any insurance coverage, stage distribution
was found to be the same between the races. Significant
stage migration was evident between 1998 and 2003,
when the percentage of patients with stage III/IV disease
doubled from 13% to 25% (APC, 11.9%; 95% CI,
2.0%-22.8% [P 5.017]). This percentage remained stable between 2004 and 2011 (APC, 2.7%; 95% CI, -0.7%
to 6.3% [P 5.12]).
Treatment Modalities

The analysis of treatment strategies was focused on patients
with early-stage NLPHL. Patients with stage IIB or stage II
disease with unrecorded B-symptoms were treated predominantly with a chemotherapy-based approach similar to
individuals with advanced-stage disease and were grouped
as such. Among those with early-stage disease, radiation
alone as an initial treatment strategy was used in 53%,
32%, and 27% of patients with stage IA, stage IB, and stage
IIA NLPHL, respectively. Chemotherapy alone was
administered in 12%, 24%, and 30% of these patients,
respectively, and combined modality therapy (CMT) was
administered in 21%, 32%, and 35% of patients, respectively. Among patients with all stages of disease, the use of
radiotherapy in NLPHL significantly decreased between
1998 and 2011 (APC, -3.0%; 95% CI, -3.9 to -2.1%
[P<.0001]), whereas chemotherapy use remained
unchanged (APC, 0.1%; 95% CI, -0.7 to 0.9% [P 5.77]).
When treatment modalities were compared by race,
it was found that among patients with early-stage
NLPHL, black individuals were significantly more likely
to have no recorded treatment (P<.00001) (Fig. 2b), but
otherwise the percentages of different modalities were
similar (P 5.76). There were no differences noted with
regard to therapy for patients with advanced-stage disease
(P 5.44). However, overall, African American individuals
were found to have a significantly longer time to treatment initiation (median, 53.5 days vs 47 days; Wilcoxon
rank sum test P<.0001). The median radiation dose was
36 grays (interquartile range, 30.6-36 grays), and was the
same for both racial groups (P 5.82). The percentage of
patients treated with 3-dimensional conformal or

intensity-modulated radiotherapy increased from 3.9% in
2004 to 34.0% in 2011 and was overall found to be similar among black and white patients (P 5.57).
Survival Analysis

Survival information was available for 1361 patients
with NLPHL who were diagnosed between 1998 and
2006 and who completed at least 5 years of consistent
follow-up. The median follow-up of surviving patients
was 7.1 years (interquartile range, 5.5-9.5 years) and

the OS rate at 7 years was 86.7% (95% CI, 84.7%88.6%). This estimate was 90.1% (95% CI, 87.6%92.1%) for patients with early-stage and 79.4% (95%

NLPHL. There was no significant difference noted
between races with regard to OS (P 5.39) (Fig. 3a) or

entire cohort, 93.9% (95% CI, 87.7%-97.0%) for

found to be significantly associated with either OS or
RS in multivariable models (Table 2).
When OS was analyzed by treatment modality in
patients with early-stage NLPHL, the 7-year OS estimate
was 94.0% (95% CI, 89.7%-96.5%) after CMT, 89.5%
(95% CI, 85.2%-92.6%) after radiotherapy alone, and
86.1% (95% CI, 78.9%-91.0%) after chemotherapy
alone (Fig. 3b). The slight advantage of CMT was not significant when stratified by age and stage subgroups (P 5
.18). However, in an exploratory analysis, we did find a
significant heterogeneity of the chemotherapy benefit by
race (test of interaction, P 5.021). Receipt of chemotherapy was associated with a higher OS among black patients
(P 5.01), whereas the survival curves for white patients
essentially overlapped (P 5.81) (Fig. 3c). The low number of events (17 events, including 3 with and 14 without
chemotherapy) precluded multivariable adjustments in
the cohort of black patients, and therefore this result
should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating only.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first
analysis of clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and
survival outcomes in patients with NLPHL using cancer
registry-based data from the United States. Thanks to the
size and multiracial nature of the cohort, which included a
majority of Americans diagnosed with NLPHL between
1998 and 2011, we demonstrated a distinct distribution
of age, sex, and anatomical site of origin among black
patients with this lymphoma. In contrast, stage at presentation and survival did not appear to differ significantly
between the races. In addition, the results of the current
study demonstrated that although various management
3476

strategies generally led to similar survival outcomes in
patients with early-stage NLPHL, the effect of chemotherapy on survival may be heterogeneous among black and
white patients.
Despite the finding that epidemiologic studies demonstrated a relatively higher incidence of NLPHL among
African American individuals,6,7 to the best of our knowledge no prior cohort analysis reported race as a variable.
The results of the current study suggest that susceptibility
to NLPHL may be mediated by interacting factors related
to race and sex. The sex-specific component is corroborated by the Finnish registry study of first-degree relatives
of patients with NLPHL, among whom female relatives
were found to have twice as high an incidence of NLPHL
as male relatives.22 Identifying the molecular basis of
NLPHL predisposition among African American individuals will require further dedicated research. In subSaharan Africa, NLPHL constitutes 9.4% of HL cases,23
but epidemiology in that region is skewed by a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency infection.24 To our
knowledge to date, the NPAT gene at chromosome
11q22-23 is the only locus linked to an increased risk of
NLPHL in some white individuals.25 Little is also known
regarding the molecular pathogenesis of NLPHL, which
has gene expression and intracellular signaling patterns
that are distinct from those of classic HL.26,27
The finding in the current study that African American individuals have similar survival compared with white
individuals is in contrast with many studies demonstrating a worse OS rate in black patients with HL, non-HLs,
and some solid tumors.28-30 Similar to many studies of
lymphoid malignancies, black patients were on average
younger than white patients, but the results were

consistent in models adjusting for age.16,30-32 Although
survival disparities are pronounced in aggressive entities
such as Burkitt or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,30,33 they
are not always evident in indolent B-cell subtypes. For
example, the LymphoCare study reported no difference in
OS (or progression-free survival [PFS]) between black or
white patients with follicular lymphoma, at least with a
fairly short median follow-up of 52 months.31 Similarly,
race was not found to be associated with significantly
worse survival in patients with marginal zone lymphoma.34 Conversely, black patients are reported to demonstrate persistently worse PFS and OS in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, possibly related to unfavorable
molecular characteristics.32,35 In many studies, impaired
access to health care has been implicated in the more frequent advanced-stage presentation noted among African
American individuals, thereby contributing to worse survival.17,28,30,36 The lack of such association in NLPHL,
despite evident socioeconomic disparities, a higher rate of
nontreatment, and longer time to treatment, might be
due to its indolent nature. Similar to low-grade B-cell
non-HLs, NLPHL has a low overall mortality rate, but is
also characterized by relatively common late recurrences.9,12,37 Therefore, although we did not detect differences in OS, significant racial disparities in PFS are
possible. Additional data regarding recurrences and histological transformation among African American patients
with NLPHL are needed because these could not be ascertained from the NCDB. OS estimates in the current analysis were lower than in prior cohorts derived from clinical
trials,8-10 but were fairly similar to other populationbased studies, and confirmed an excellent prognosis associated with NLPHL.4,12,38
The US National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guidelines recommend radiotherapy alone for patients
with early-stage NLPHL, whereas European guidelines
favor CMT except for patients with stage IA disease.13,39

this rare disease, expert recommendations are based on
retrospective case series, phase 2 studies, and subsets of
multicenter randomized trials.37,40-42 Selected patients
with a completely excised single lesion may receive no further therapy; this strategy reportedly resulted in no recurrences for 67% of pediatric patients in one study.43 We
noted no significant survival disadvantage in patients with
NLPHL who had no recorded initial treatment modality
in the NCDB. Some of those cases may have been managed with watchful waiting, but others may have had
underascertained treatment, and therefore we did not analyze that group in detail. It is interesting to note that an
analysis of the French Lymphoma Study Association
found an advantage for active treatment over watchful
waiting in terms of PFS, but not for OS, in patients with
NLPHL.44 Conversely, an advantage of CMT over radiotherapy was suggested by a retrospective Canadian comparison of 88 patients treated with radiation alone before
1993 or with CMT afterward.12 The stage migration evident in the current study, and likely related to an increased
use of positron emission tomography in the early 2000s,
highlights the potential bias of such historical cohort comparisons. A recent study of 256 patients with stage IA
NLPHL treated within German Hodgkin Study Group
trials reported a 100% response rate regardless of initial
therapy and a PFS rate of 91.9% at 8 years after involvedfield radiotherapy and of 88.5% after CMT.45 We note
that only approximately one-half of Americans with stage
IA NLPHL were treated with radiation alone. The results
of the current study indicate that despite conflicting opinions regarding the need for chemotherapy to cure earlystage NLPHL,3,14,46 significant differences in OS between
treatment strategies are undetectable within 10 years of
follow-up, although CMT provided the numerically highest survival at 7 years. The lack of differences in OS does
not rule out significant differences in freedom from treatment failure, which is admittedly an important issue for a
disease that may become incurable at the time of
recurrence.
The current analysis was limited by its retrospective
nature and the data source. We relied on the recorded histology designation to identify NLPHL, but discordances
between lymphoma diagnoses rendered by community
and expert pathologists have been recognized previously.47 NLPHL may be difficult to distinguish from
T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma or “gray zone”
lymphomas when histologic material is limited. In the
British Columbia Cancer Agency study, 16% of NLPHL
cases were reclassified as other lymphomas.12 Other series
based on cases from the 1990s, which were diagnosed
3478

using the older Rye classification, had even higher rates
(up to 40%) of exclusion on central pathology review.2,40
Conversely, a US report from 2001 through 2006, after
the standardized World Health Organization classification, indicated no change in the NLPHL designation after
expert review.48 The NCDB data reflect the best diagnostic effort of US pathologists and describe consequent
treatment choices and clinical outcomes. Because of the
lack of a histology review, we could not investigate the
possible differential racial prevalence of variant morphologic features, which are known to correlate with worse
NLPHL prognosis.49 We also lacked details regarding
chemotherapy drugs, regimens, or treatment duration, as
well as information concerning disease recurrences, PFS,
and histological transformation. Finally, even in this large
data set, we encountered an insufficient number of deaths
with which to conduct multivariable analyses of associations between treatments and survival, and therefore the
results may be subject to significant bias inherent to retrospective observational data. We should also point out that
the NCDB contains data reported by a subset of US hospitals. Although these facilities care for the majority of
patients with cancer in the United States, their records
cannot be generalized to the entire population, unlike the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program,
which captures all incident cancers in its geographic coverage. Furthermore, although we used the terms “black”
and “African American” interchangeably, race designation
in the NCDB is established from medical records, and
may not be consistently identified in the increasingly multiracial society. Racial differences in cancer biology are
best analyzed within the context of verifiable genetic or
ethnic background.
Nevertheless, based on the results of the current
study, it can be concluded that NLPHL in African American individuals has several specific features at the time of
presentation, and possibly with regard to its clinical course
and treatment effects. Further research could elucidate the
biologic differences underlying those distinct characteristics, leading to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of NLPHL, and translate them further into
therapeutic advances.
FUNDING SUPPORT
The research was funded by academic departments.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
Dr. Olszewski has received consulting fees from Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company for work performed outside of the current
study.
