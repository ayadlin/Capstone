ABSTRACT
ST7612AA1 (property of Sigma-Tau), a thioacetate-ω (γ-lactam amide) derivative,
is a potent, second generation, oral pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). Aim
of the study was to assess the efficacy of ST7612AA1 in solid and haematological
tumors, and to characterize its mechanism of action. In vitro, ST7612AA1 potently
inhibited different class I and class II HDACs, leading to restore the balance of both
histone and non-histone protein acetylation. In vivo, it induced significant anti-tumor
effects in xenograft models of lung, colon, breast and ovarian carcinomas, leukemia
and lymphoma. This was likely due to the modulation of different HDAC substrates
and induction of transcriptional changes with respect to several genes involved in key
processes, such as cell cycle regulation, DNA damage checkpoints, immune response,
cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. PK analysis confirmed the prodrug nature of ST7612AA1, which is rapidly absorbed and converted to ST7464AA1
after a single oral dose in mice. ST7612AA1 was selected from a novel generation
of oral HDAC inhibitors. Its high efficacy correlated with its potent and selective
inhibitory activity of HDAC and was combined with a favorable pharmacodynamics
profile. These aspects support a clinical development of ST7612AA1 towards a broad
spectrum of human solid and haematologic malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

[2], thus histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) able to
bind with high affinity to HDACs and to severely affect
their enzymatic activity, have emerged as a promising
new class of multifunctional anticancer drugs [3, 4]. In
fact, HDACis have been previously shown to reduce
multiple epigenetic pathways exerting pro-tumorigenic
activity. In addition to regulate gene expression and
transcription through chromatin remodelling, HDACis
can also modulate a variety of cellular functions including
growth, differentiation, and survival [5, 6], by enhancing
acetylation of a wide variety of proteins, including

Epigenetic mechanisms result in changes in gene
expression without altering the DNA sequence per se.
These changes involve DNA methylation and histone
modifications (such as acetylation), which are potentially
reversible. Due to this property, modulation of epigenetic
gene suppression has become a very attractive model to
treat cancer [1]. The expression of histone deacetylases
(HDAC) is frequently altered in several malignancies

transcription factors, modular chaperones, and structural
components [3, 7]. Specifically, HDACis have been
shown to induce several down-stream effects in tumor cell
lines, including: cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis,
inhibition of angiogenesis, activation or inactivation of
tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes, and decrease of
invasion and metastasis [3, 4, 8]. Interestingly, tumor cells
appear much more sensitive to the induction of apoptosis
by HDAC inhibitors than normal cells, probably linked
to the disturbed chromatin structure in cancer cells [9]
and to the induction of double-strand DNA breaks [10].
The classical HDAC inhibitors inhibit the function of
one or more of the 11 known zinc-containing HDAC
enzymes. The zinc-containing HDAC enzymes can be
classified into several Classes: Class I HDAC (HDAC1,
2, 3, 8), Class IIA (HDAC4, 5, 7, 9), Class IIB (HDAC6,
10) and Class IV (HDAC11) [11]. Class III HDACs or
Sirtuins, have a different catalytic mechanism and are
not a target for the classical HDAC inhibitors. Generally,
pan-HDAC inhibitors inhibit HDACs from Class I, II and
IV, while Class specific-HDAC inhibitors only inhibit
HDACs from either Class I or Class II. At the present,
three HDACis – vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic
acid, Zolinza) orally delivered, depsipeptide (romidepsin,
Istodax) and belinostat (Beleodaq) intravenously
delivered– have received approval from the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of refractory
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and more recently,
depsipeptide has gained FDA approval for peripheral
T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) [12-14]. Several HDAC
inhibitors are under clinical development in various
malignancies, many of them of haematological origin,
such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myelodysplastic
syndrome [2, 15]. Broadly, HDACis can be classified into
different structural groups: the hydroxamic acids, cyclic
peptides, benzimides and short-chain fatty acids. Although
HDAC inhibitors preferentially targeting a single HDAC
have been recently developed [16], it is noteworthy that
the hydroxamates are able to target and affect all classes
of HDACs, thus exerting nonspecific HDAC-inhibition
activity [17, 18].
We previously identified a highly potent HDAC
inhibitor, named ST7612AA1 as prodrug of ST7464AA1
(Figure 1A), showing oral antitumor activity in human
tumor-bearing mice. This thioacetyl derivative, selected
within a lactam carboxamide inhibitors screening project,
showed a high cytotoxic activity on NCI-H460 (NSCLC)
and HCT116 (colon carcinoma) cell lines and associated
to strong induction of tubulin and histone H4 acetylation
in cellular assays [19]. The active drug, ST7464AA1
revealed the maximum potency on HDAC3 and 6 (mean
of IC50= 4 nM), and then on HDAC1, 10 and 11 (mean
of IC50=13 nM) and HDAC2 (IC50=78 nM). The minor
potency was observed on HDAC8 (IC50=281 nM) [19].
In this study, the ability of ST7612AA1 in different
pre-clinical cancer models characterized by specific
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

protein-overexpression or mutation was determined
to better define the pharmacological profile of the
drug. Here we report that this novel HDAC inhibitor
potently inhibited cell growth/proliferation in human
tumor cell lines from both solid and hematologic origin,
and significantly suppressed tumor growth in several
xenograft models after oral daily delivery, thus suggesting
a putative application against some tumor subsets in
patients. Furthermore, the drug-dependent modulation
of some transcripts involved in immune response and
in key pathogenetic pathways, such NF-κB pathway
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, would suggest a
relevant implication not only in cancer therapy but also in
the inflammatory diseases.

RESULTS
ST7612AA1 reduces HDACs activity
We have previously shown that ST7464AA1 (the
active drug of ST7612AA1) is a very potent HDAC
inhibitor, displaying activity against different HDAC
isoforms in the low nanomolar range [19]. Here, we
assessed the ability of ST7612AA1 to affect in vitro
acetylation of tubulin and histone H4 substrates, which
is mainly dependent on HDAC6 and class I HDACs
respectively, through Western Blot analysis on NCI-H460
NSCLC cells. As shown in Figure 1B, ST7612AA1
was 40-fold more potent in increasing the acetylation of
histone H4 (IC50 = 4.8 nM) than of tubulin (IC50 = 200
nM). Results and details of the densitometry analysis are
shown in Supplementary Figure 1. ST7612AA1 was very
effective at increasing histone acetylation at concentrations
lower than those determining cytotoxicity on the same cell
line, thus confirming the ability of its drug (once released
within the cell) to bind with a very high affinity to the
catalytic site of different HDAC isoforms.

ST7612AA1 affects proliferation and induces
apoptosis in human tumor cell lines
ST7612AA1 showed a high potency in terms of
antiproliferative effects in a first broad panel of human
tumor cell lines from both solid and hematologic origin. As
indicated in Table 1, ST7612AA1 inhibited proliferation
in cell lines derived from epithelial cancers (lung, breast,
colon, ovarian) and from leukemias and lymphomas, with
IC50 values ranging from 43 to 500 nmol/L. ST7612AA1
also inhibited the proliferation with comparable potency
of different mature B cell lymphomas with a median
IC50 of 375 nM (range, 46-2664 nM). There were no
significant differences among histological subtypes
or between germinal center B cell like (GCB) and the
activated B cell like (ABC) type –DLBCL: ABC-DLBCL

(102-257 nM). As shown in Supplementary Figure 2, the
ST7612AA1 anti-proliferative activity was both time and
dose-dependent. Exposure to ST7612AA1 (250 nM) for
72 hrs induced moderate apoptosis in three out of eight
lymphoma cell lines (Figure 1C). Differently from what
observed regarding on the anti-proliferative activity, the
apoptosis was apparently restricted to cell lines bearing a
wild type TP53.

To obtain a global view of the transcriptional
changes after ST7612AA1 treatment, we performed
GEP (Gene Expression Profiling) on two sensitive cell
lines, one derived from GCB-DLBCL (DOHH2) and
one from ABC-DLBCL (TMD8). We first confirmed the
anti-deacetylase activity of ST7612AA1 in the two cell
lines (Figure 2A). Then, the tumor cells were exposed
to DMSO or to ST7612AA1 (300 nM) for 8 hours.

expression profile of the two DLBCL cell lines: applying
stringent criteria (genes showing fold change > 1.5,
with an adjusted p-value < 0.005, were considered as
differentially expressed) 674 genes were up-regulated and
563 down-regulated (Supplementary Table 4). Among
the most down-regulated genes there were genes known
as oncogenes or involved in lymphoma pathogenesis
such as IRAK1, MYD88, MYC, MYB, CCND2, BLK,
CDK4, IKZF1 or TNFRSF17 (BCMA). Conversely, the
up-regulated ones comprised tumor suppressor genes
(CDKN2C, CDKN1A, CDKN2D) or genes involved in
immune response (HLA, CD69). Validation of GEP results
was obtained by real-time PCR analysis, confirming the
up-regulation of CDKN1A and down-regulation of MYC,
IRAK4, MYD88, STAT3, and, in the ABC-DLBCL cell line,
also of IRAK1 (Supplementary Figure 3). Further insights
on the pathways affected by exposure to the HDACi were
provided by applying the GSEA algorithm (Supplementary
Table 5). Functional analysis highlighted that the downregulated genes were significantly enriched of MYC
targets, E2F targets, transcripts coding proteins involved in
cell cycle, RNA processing, G1/S transition, DNA damage
checkpoint, genes down-regulated in hypoxia, by other

HDACis, or by mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Up-regulated
genes were significantly enriched of genes involved in
packaging of telomeres, in meiosis, in RNA polymerase I
promoter opening, in autophagy regulation, genes coding
components of lysosome, cell adhesion molecules, genes
up-regulated by other HDACi, genes of the DLBCL
prognostically favorable stromal signature. Figure 2C
shows some of the gene sets significantly enriched among
down- and up-regulated genes.

ST7612AA1 causes growth inhibition of different
tumor xenografts
Following the observed potent in vitro inhibition of
tumor cell proliferation by ST7612AA1, we subsequently
investigated whether these properties translated into
tumor growth inhibition in preclinical in vivo models.
Oral ST7612AA1 (60 mg/10 mL/kg, qdx5/w, for 2-4
weeks), strongly inhibited the growth of different preestablished tumor xenografts. In particular, as shown in
Table 2, ST7612AA1 inhibited tumor volume by 77%
(P<0.01 vs vehicle treated group) in the colon carcinoma

model HCT116, consistently with the antiproliferative
effect achieved in vitro against the same tumor cell line.
Analogously, a potent and significant antitumor activity
of ST7612AA1 was also shown against other solid tumor
xenografts, such as the NSCLC model NCI-H1975
(TVI=65%, P<0.001), the ovarian carcinoma model
SKOV-3 (TVI=59%, P<0.01) and the breast cancer model
MDA-MB436 orthotopically implanted in mammary

efficacy of ST7612AA1 was also observed against
hematological tumor models, as shown by the potent
antitumor activity (TVI=70%, P<0.01) in the AML model
MV4;11 (Table 2) and in the GCB-DLBCL model DOHH2
bearing both MYC and BCL2 chromosomal rearrangement

activated by DNA damage events (TP53-mediated or not),
or associated to a putative ER-stress response, might be
involved. This evidence is further supported by qPCR
data, showing increased mRNA levels of several genes
associated to DNA-damage (gadd45α), TP53-mediated
pro-apoptotic events (Noxa, P53AIP1, stratifin) and
ER-stress response (gadd153/CHOP). Treatment with
ST7612AA1 also resulted in down-modulation of NFκB gene (Figure 3B), whereas no effect was observed
on the expression of genes involved in DNA replication,
such as TYMS and AURK-A, although the last one was
moderately down-modulated at the protein level (Figure
3A). Finally, because HDACis have been shown to
counteract the EMT process in different tumor models
[20, 21], we next assessed the effects of ST7612AA1
on epithelial/mesenchymal markers in HCT116 tumor
xenografts. As shown in Figure 3B, ST7612AA1 induced
a significant overexpression of several genes (e-cadherin,
keratins 4/18, TJP1, PDE4D, claudin 1) coding typical
epithelial markers and a concomitant down-modulation
of genes associated to mesenchymal phenotype, such
as ACTA2, syndecan-1 and vimentin (the last one being
dramatically down-regulated also at the protein level, as
depicted in Figure 3A). Overall, biochemical data suggest
that reversion of the EMT process might contribute to the
in vivo antitumor activity of the drug.

ST7612AA1 affects key molecular pathways in
colon cancer in vivo model
Western Blot analysis of the HCT116 tumor
xenografts collected 24 h after the last oral administration
of ST7612AA1 revealed a strong induction of pan
H3 acetylation (Figure 3A). Besides restoring histone
acetylation through inhibition of class I HDACs,
ST7612AA1 was also effective in targeting HDAC6, as
shown by the increased levels of acetylated α-tubulin and
by the dramatic decrease of HSP90 protein levels (this
effect likely due to hyperacetylation of the chaperone),
paralleled by a significant increase of HSP70 levels.
Moreover, treatment of HCT116 tumor-bearing mice
with ST7612AA1 resulted in up-regulation of P21 and
ATF3 proteins, also confirmed at the transcriptional level
in Figure 3B, thus suggesting that molecular pathways,

Ras-mutant HCT116 colon carcinoma xenografts, thus
suggesting a putative therapeutic approach towards this
subset of strongly proliferating dedifferentiated colorectal
carcinoma, characterized by overexpression of class I
HDAC family members and associated with reduced
patient survival [22].
In addition, our data indicate that ST7612AA1 can
significantly inhibit in vitro the proliferation of NSCLC
cell lines bearing wild type EGFR (and mutant KRAS),
such as NCI-H460, as well as a secondary (T790M) EGFR
mutation, which is known to confer resistance to tyrosine
kinase inhibitors [23], such as NCI-H1975. Interestingly,
ST7612AA1 showed also a significant in vivo antitumor
effect against the latter tumor xenograft model.
Since class I HDAC isoforms are expressed at
significantly higher levels in ovarian cancer compared
to normal ovarian tissue [24], and various HDAC
inhibitors can prevent both in vitro and in vivo growth of
ovarian cancer cells [25, 26], we investigated the in vivo
efficacy of ST7612AA1 also in two ovarian carcinoma
models. Our data clearly showed a strong antitumor
effect of ST7612AA1 against both the SKOV-3 model,
characterized by low levels of PTEN and overexpression
of EGFR and ErbB2 [27], and even more the A2780
xenograft, characterized by the absence of PTEN [19].
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents
a heterogeneous subset of neoplasms defined by the
absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor

15% of globally diagnosed breast cancers and which
does not respond to hormonal therapy (such as tamoxifen

DISCUSSION
Recently, a systematic study of medicinal chemistry
aimed at identifying a new generation of HDAC inhibitors
led us to select a new class of thiol-based potent panHDACis [19]. In vivo pharmacodynamic analysis of
several preselected analogues resulted in the identification
of ST7612AA1, (property of Sigma-Tau), a thioacetate-ω
(γ-lactam amide) derivative, first synthetic thiol derivative,
as potent oral pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi),
in preclinical phase. This a prodrug of ST7464AA1, which
has exquisite potency toward all class I HDACs (IC50
values of 12.7 and 77.7 nM for HDAC1 and HDAC2,
respectively) and toward HDAC isoforms encompassed
within the class IIb HDACs (IC50 value of 3.18 nM for
HDAC6). In agreement with the powerful inhibition of
class I HDACs, here, we show that ST7612AA1 had a
broad spectrum antiproliferative activity on cell lines
derived from ovarian cancer, breast cancer, NSCLC,
colon cancer and haematological tumors, including acute
monocytic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia and
lymphoma, at concentrations that are significantly below
those achieved in plasma of mice (Cmax, 1577 ± 478 ng/
mL, dosing ST7612AA1 po at 120 mg/kg). Importantly,
the oral treatment with ST7612AA1, once daily, for 2
or 3 weeks, strongly inhibited tumor growth in several
preclinical in vivo models derived from both solid tumors

or aromatase inhibitors) or therapies that target HER2
receptors [28-31]. Anyhow, recent papers have suggested
a putative therapeutic approach also with HDAC inhibitors
[32, 33]. ST7612AA1 evidenced a strong antiproliferative
activity in vitro against two TNBC cell lines (MDAMB231 and MDA-MB436). Moreover, when tested in
vivo against the BRCA1-defective MDA-MB436 tumor
xenograft ortotopically implanted in mammary fat pad,
ST7612AA1 caused a significant reduction of tumor
growth associated to minimal animal toxicity, thus
providing promising preclinical data that would suggest a
putative therapeutic approach against this subset of breast
cancer.
The ST7612AA1 treatment resulted also in a
significant tumor growth inhibition of the AML model
MV4;11, subcutaneously implanted in athymic nude
mice. MV4;11 tumor is known to be driven by the tyrosine
kinase receptor Flt3-ITD mutation. The activating internal
tandem duplications (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain
of FLT3 have been identified in 35% AML patients [34].
MV4;11 has been shown to be dependent on FLT3-ITD
by its sensitivity to selective FLT3 kinase inhibitors
[35]. The best approach to the treatment of FLT3-ITD
AML is currently undefined, and multiple clinical
trials are investigating FLT3 kinase inhibitors [36] but,
unfortunately, their action is very often transient, possibly
due to inadequate dosing or insufficient selectivity of these
drugs. For these reasons, treatment with our HDACi might
represent a promising therapeutic option also for patients
with this kind of tumor.
Deregulation of proteins involved in chromatin
remodelling is very frequent in lymphomas, which
represent an interesting target for HDACi [12, 13,
37]. Here, ST7612AA1 presented a wide in vitro antiproliferative activity on various models of lymphomas,
induced apoptosis in TP53 wild type lymphoma cells,
affected relevant pathogenetic pathways in DLBCL cell
lines, and also reduced the growth of DLBCL xenografts.
In particular, ST7612AA1 affected the NF-κB signaling,
and this is of particular interest for the important role
played by this pathway in the pathogenesis of certain
lymphoma subtypes, such as the ABC-DLBCL, MCL
and marginal zone lymphomas [38, 39]. Moreover, the
compound was also able to down-regulate MYC target
genes, and this might be clinically relevant for DLBCL,
in which MYC confers a very poor clinical outcome
when co-expressed with the BCL2 protein or when cotranslocated with the BCL2 gene [39, 40]. Importantly,
the in vivo antitumor activity of ST7612AA1 was indeed
observed against a cell line characterized by both MYC
and BCL2 gene translocations. Thus, the compound
appears worth of further investigation in the lymphoma
context. Furthermore, present molecular and biochemical
data suggest that, once hydrolyzed, ST7612AA1 acts
both in nucleus and cytoplasm of the target tumor cell,
through HDAC6 inhibition, as observed for other HDACi
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the hydroxamate class [41]. In fact, beside restoring
the balance of the histone acetylation that, in turn, results
in a more relaxed chromatin structure, with areas of
loosely compacted, and hencemore transcriptionally
active chromatin that is more prone to DNA double strand
breaks [42], ST7612AA1 is also able to target non-histone
HDAC substrates involved, for example in the regulation
of multiple cellular functions, such as P53, alpha-tubulin
or the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), through inhibition
of HDAC6, which has been implicated in DNA damage
signaling, transcription factor binding, and DNA repair
processes [43]. Interestingly, at least when tested in vivo
against colon carcinoma xenografts, ST7612AA1 induced
increased transcription of e-cadherin, keratins and other
typical epithelial markers and, concomitantly, induced
down-regulation of vimentin and other genes associated
to the mesenchymal phenotype, thus suggesting that
treatment with ST7612AA1 might also cause a “cadherin
switch” and reversion of the EMT process. Other HDAC
inhibitors such as SAHA, TSA and panobinostat were
shown to induce EMT phenotype, which was associated
with increased expression of mesenchymal markers such
as vimentin, N-cadherin and fibronectin [44, 45]. The
ability of cells to transdifferentiate and dedifferentiate
plays a key role in invasion and metastasis by the process
of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) [46], and
differentiation patterning may be used as an additional
prognostic and predictive indicator for therapeutic
effectiveness.
Histone
deacetylase
inhibitors
(HDACi)
were primarily developed as anti-tumor agents for
cancer, but many are now being explored for treating
neurodegenerative, immunologic, metabolic, inflammatory
and cardiovascular disorders [47].
ST7612AA1 was able to determine expression
changes of transcripts involved in immune response and
in key pathogenetic pathways, such as the NF-κB pathway
and cell cycle alteration, thus suggesting a relevant
putative involvement not only in cancer therapy but also in
the inflammatory diseases [48]. Lysine acetylation is a key
regulator of the NF-κB pathway, which works in concert
with other PTMs via complex crosstalk mechanisms
to determine the signaling output. Importantly, small
molecule modulators of its writers (HATs) or erasers
(HDACs) have been demonstrated to regulate NF-κB
signaling, suggesting that these are potential drugs for
inflammatory diseases.
These data combined with the excellent in vivo
tolerability and the oral delivery may represent a
therapeutic advantage for this novel HDAC inhibitor.
In conclusion, based upon the obtained data,
ST7612AA1 appears as a candidate for clinical
development to evaluate its therapeutic activity towards
a broad spectrum of human solid and haematologic
malignancies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

and were exposed to increasing concentrations of
ST7612AA1 for 48 or 72 h; the anti-proliferative activity
was assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The drug potency
was evaluated by means of the “ALLFIT” computer
program and defined as IC50 (drug concentration required
for 50% inhibition of cell survival).

Ethics statement
All animal experiments were conducted according
to relevant national and international guidelines.
Experimental protocols were approved by the Ethic
Committee for Animal Experimentation of Sigma
Tau according to the United Kingdom Coordinating
Committee on Cancer Research Guidelines. When tumor
volume exceeded 2 cm3, mice were euthanized by cervical
dislocation.

Detection of apoptotic cells
Apoptosis was assessed, on cells treated with DMSO
or different doses of ST7612AA1, by Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences), according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations, on a FACScan flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences).

Drugs

Western blotting analysis

For in vitro experiments, stock solutions of
ST7612AA1 (property of Sigma-Tau) were prepared in
100% dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mM and stored at -20°C.
For oral administration, ST7612AA1 was dissolved in
solutol HS15 + water (1:20) and delivered in a volume of
10 mL/kg.

For assessing the in vitro effect of ST7612AA1 on
acetylation of α-tubulin and histones, NSCLC cells were
treated with the test compound at various concentrations
(dose-response curve). SAHA 5 µM was used as
reference inhibitor. Protein extraction, separation and
immunoblotting were performed as previously described
[19]. Immunoreactive bands were finally subjected to
densitometry analysis by a phosphoimaging system
(STORM, Molecular Dynamics), and then the IC50 values
were calculated by the “ALLFIT” computer program. The
antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Cell lines and cell culture
Supplementary Table 1 lists all the cell lines used
with their growth conditions and their origin. All cells
were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5%
CO2 at 37°C. All experiments were always performed
starting from frozen cell stocks of each cell line. Upon
thawing, such cells were characterized in house, by
assessing cell morphology, cell growth kinetics curve and
absence of mycoplasma. The human cell lines purchased
from accredited biological resource centers (i.e. ATCC,
ECACC, DSMZ) have been originally authenticated and
characterized directly by the providers (STR profiling).
Lymphoma cell lines were validated by the Authors
using DNA profiling within the last six months from the
beginning of the study. All the experiments have been then
performed using cells within 6-8 passages since thawing
from an internal cell bank.

In vivo xenograft models
Experiments on solid tumor and acute leukemia in
vivo models were carried out at Sigma-Tau (Rome, Italy)
using female athymic nude mice, 5-6 weeks-old (Harlan
Laboratories, Udine, IT). Mice were maintained in laminar
flow rooms with constant temperature and humidity in
according to the NIH guidelines. The following human
tumor xenograft models were used for antitumor activity
studies: HCT116 derived from colon carcinoma), MV4;11
from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), SKOV-3 from
ovarian carcinoma, and NCI-H1975 from non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Exponentially growing tumor cells
were s.c. inoculated (5x106/mouse) in the right flank of
nude mice. Groups of eight mice/group were employed to
assess antitumor activity. MDA-MB436 breast carcinoma
(3x106 cells/0.1 mL of M199/Matrigel GFR 50:50, vol/
vol solution) was inoculated in mammary fat pad (mfp).
Drug treatments were started from 3 to 11 days after
tumor injection, depending on the tumor growth of the
xenografted cancer model. ST7612AA1 was given daily
for five days per week (qdx5/w). Tumor growth was
followed by measurements of tumor diameters with a
Vernier caliper. Tumor volume (TV) was calculated

In vitro proliferation assay
Anti-proliferative activity was first assessed on
a panel of cell lines derived from solid tumors and
hematological cancers and then on a large panel of cell
lines derived from mature B-cell lymphomas. In the
first panel, cells were seeded in 96-wells tissue culture
plates in complete medium and, 24 h after seeding, were
exposed to increasing concentrations of ST7612AA1 for
72 h; the inhibition of proliferation was assessed by the
sulphorodamine B assay. Lymphoma cells were seeded
in 96-wells tissue culture plates in complete medium

levels of cyclophilin A were quantitatively measured in
each sample to control for sample-to-sample differences
in RNA concentration. The cycling conditions comprised
a 600 s denaturation step at at 95°C, followed by 40
cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at
60°C for 20 s, and extension at 72°C for 10 s. The
oligonucleotides used as specific primers for each target
gene were designed, using the manufacturer’s software
and the sequences available in GenBank, to overlap a
splice junction thereby avoiding a potential amplification
of contaminating genomic DNA, and are described in
Supplementary Table 3. A six-point serial standard curve
was generated for each target gene. All expression levels
were finally normalized to cyclophilin A in each well.

using the formula: TV (mm3) = [d2 x D]/2, where d and
D are the shortest and the longest diameter, respectively.
The efficacy of the drug treatment was assessed as: TV
inhibition percentage (TVI%) in treated versus control
mice, calculated as: TVI%=100-(mean TV treated/mean
TV control x100). When tumors reached a volume of 5001000 mm3, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation.
To examine the possible toxicity of treatment, body
weight was recorded throughout the study. BWL% (body
weight loss) was calculated as 100 – (mean BWdayx/mean
BWday1x100), where day 1 is the first day of treatment and
day x is any day after (maximum BWL%). DT as doubling
time of control tumors was also evaluated.
In order to assess the in vivo effect of ST7612AA1
on the acetylation degree of α-tubulin and histones, and
on the expression of other key proteins, HCT116 tumor
xenografts (3 samples/group) were excised at different
times after the last treatment, and then total protein
lysates were prepared through the homogenization of
tumor samples in lysis buffer containing 0.5% NP40, supplemented with 10 µg/mL of protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).
Determination of the protein concentration and Western
Blotting analysis were finally performed as above
described for the in vitro experiments. The antibodies used
are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
The in vivo experiment with lymphoma model
was performed in the IOR laboratory according to study
protocols approved by the local Cantonal Veterinary
Authority (No. 5/2011). At day 1, tumors were established
by injecting DOHH2 lymphoma cells (200 µL of PBS,
8x106 cells/mouse) into the left flanks of 5-weeks old
female NOD-SCID mice (Harlan Laboratories). Tumor
size was measured on regular basis and until tumors
reached around 0.5 mm in diameter (day 12). Then,
treatments were conducted at day 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19.
Tumors were measured at 12, 14, 17, 21, 25 days. Tumor
volumes were calculated as described above. Mice were
sacrificed when physical conditions became critical
or when tumors reached a weight of about 0.5 gr. For
comparison between a control and a treatment group, an
unpaired Mann-Whitney’s test was used. A P-value <0.05
was considered significant.

PK sampling and analysis
CD1 nude mice were used. Male mice were treated
with a single dose of ST7612AA1 at 120 mg/10 mL/
kg p.o., using 5% Solutol HS 15 in water for injection
as vehicle. Blood samples were collected at 0.25, 0.5,
1, 2, 4 and 6 h post treatment from 5 animals per time
point. Levels of ST7612AA1 and ST7464AA1 were
determined in plasma by quantitative LC-MS/MS having
a limit of quantification of 25 ng/mL. The PK parameters
Cmax (maximum plasma concentration), Tmax (time of
maximum plasma concentration), Clast (last quantifiable
concentration), Tlast (time of last quantifiable plasma
concentration), AUClast (area under the concentration
vs time curve from 0 to Tlast), AUCINF (area under the
concentration vs time curve from 0 to infinity), T1/2
(terminal half-life), CL/F (apparent systemic clearance)
and Vz/F (apparent terminal volume of distribution) were
derived from the analyte plasma concentration vs time data
according to a model independent approach for sparse data
sampling by using Phoenix WinNonlin® ver. 6.3 software
(Pharsight, Cetara).

Gene expression profiling
Gene Expression Profiling (GEP) was done using
the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina,
San Diego, CA, USA), as previously described [49].
Three replicates were done for each condition. Data were
quantile normalized and differential expression analysis
was performed using LIMMA [50]. Quantitative Real-time
Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed as
previously described [49] (primer sequences available
upon request). Gene-sets differentially affected by
exposure to ST7612AA1 were identified with the Gene
Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) tool using the GSEA C2,
C3.tft, C6 collections [51] and the Signature DB collection
[52]. Raw data are available at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo)

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from tumour xenografts
and then retrotranscribed using the Trizol reagent and the
ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK),
respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
SYBR Green-based qPCR analyses were performed in
96-well plates by using the 7900HT Sequence Detection
System instrument and software (Applied Biosystems).
Amplification mixes (20 µL) contained 1x QuantiTect
SYBR PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), and 0.20.3 µM of each specific primer. In addition, the mRNA
