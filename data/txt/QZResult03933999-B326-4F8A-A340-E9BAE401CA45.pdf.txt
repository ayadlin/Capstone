The BH3 Mimetic ABT-737 Induces Cancer Cell Senescence

Abstract
ABT-737, a small molecule cell-permeable Bcl-2 antagonist that acts by mimicking BH3 proteins, induces
apoptotic cell death in multiple cancer types. However, when incubated with this agent many solid tumor cell
lines do not undergo apoptosis. The current study reveals a novel mechanism whereby ABT-737 when added to
apoptosis-resistant cancer cells has profound biologic effects. In PV-10 cells, a renal cell carcinoma that does not
die after ABT-737 treatment, this agent induces a two-fold change in the transcription of nearly 430 genes. Many
of these induced mRNA changes are in secreted proteins, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-11 and chemokines CXCL2 and
CXCL5, or genes associated with an "inflammatory" phenotype. Strikingly, these gene changes are highly similar
to those changes previously identified in cellular senescence. Brief exposure of apoptosis-resistant renal, lung
and prostate cancer cell lines to ABT-737, although not capable of inducing cell death, causes the induction of
senescence-associated b-galactosidase and inhibition of cell growth consistent with the induction of cellular
senescence. Evidence indicates that the induction of senescence occurs as a result of reactive oxygen species
elevation followed by low-level activation of the caspase cascade, insufficient to induce apoptosis, but sufficient
to lead to minor DNA damage and increases in p53, p21, IL-6 and 8 proteins. By overexpression of a dominantnegative p53 protein, we show that ABT-737-induced cellular senescence is p53-dependent. Thus, in multiple
cancer types in which ABT-737 is incapable of causing cell death, ABT-737 may have additional cellular activities
that make its use as an anticancer agent highly attractive. Cancer Res; 71(2); 506–15. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Aberrant expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of
proteins in human cancer is correlated with poor outcomes
after standard chemotherapy. One approach to overcoming
this blockade is the development of compounds such as ABT737, a cell permeable small molecule Bcl-2 family antagonist
that is capable of binding to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, but does
not block the activity of Mcl-1, Bfl-1/A1 and Bcl-B (1). This
agent functions by displacing BH3 proteins, such as Bim, from
these proteins activating Bax and Bak to induce apoptotic cell
death (2) and has the ability to kill leukemia and lymphoma
(1), multiple myeloma (3), glioblastoma (4) and small cell lung

cancer cell lines (5). On the basis of these results an orally
active form of this compound, ABT-263, has entered clinical
trials (6, 7).
Emerging results show that ABT-737, especially when used
to treat solid tumors including lung, prostate, and renal
cancers (1, 8), can be ineffective at inducing apoptosis. Resistance to ABT-737 is in part mediated by the elevated expression of Mcl-1 or Bfl-1/A1, which are not capable of binding this
compound (9, 10). Carcinomas exhibit elevated levels of
endogenous Mcl-1 and are resistant to killing by this agent
(8, 11). Alternatively, we have suggested (8) that ABT-737,
although not inducing cell death in tumor cells, could instead
be an important anticancer agent functioning by regulating
gene transcription sensitizing resistant tumor types to alternative therapies. For example, we have shown that application
of ABT-737 transcriptionally induces increases in the level of
tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) death receptor 5 (8) enhancing cell killing by the
addition of the proapoptotic protein TRAIL. Likewise, ABT737 resistance in glioma and pancreatic cells expressing high
levels of Mcl-1 was completely reversed by cotreatment of
TRAIL (4, 12).
To investigate in more depth the extent of transcriptional
changes induced by ABT-737 in tumor cells resistant to
apoptosis, we have treated the renal carcinoma cell line
PV-10 and examined changes in mRNA levels by microarray
analysis. Gene chip analysis reveals that ABT-737 treatment
regulates more than 400 genes many of which are cytokines
and chemokines. Interestingly, we find that these gene
changes have been previously identified (13–15) as markers

of cellular senescence. Senescence is a complex programmed
cellular response to multiple stimuli, including DNA damage,
oncogene expression, or telomere shortening associated with
aging, which is characterized by irreversible growth arrest
accompanied by distinct morphologic changes such as an
increased number of enlarged and flattened cells (16). On the
basis of this initial result, we have further examined the
biochemical mechanism regulating the ability of ABT-737
to inhibit tumor cell growth and induce the senescent phenotype.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
Human cancer cell lines, including 22Rv1, DU145, A549, WI38, purchased from the ATCC (authenticated by short tandem
repeats single nucleotide polymorphism, and fingerprint analyses), and PV-10 cells (8) provided by Drs. R. Gemmill and H.
Drabkin (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston,
SC), were used for senescence studies. Cell lines were cultured
according to the supplier's instructions, and maintained at low
passage number for less than 6 months. ABT-737 (A-779024.0)
and its inactive enantiomer (A-793844.0) were a gift of Abbott
Laboratories. Both compounds were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) at 20 mmol/L and aliquots
were stored at 80 C.
Viruses and infection
Human GIPZ lentiviruses encoding short hairpin microRNAs
against ATM (V2LHS_89368) and CAP3 (V2THS_15048 plus
V2THS_15049), and a nonsilencing control were purchased from
Open Biosystems. Arrest-In Lentiviral expression system (Open

www.aacrjournals.org

Biosystems) was used to establish PV-10 and 22Rv1 cell lines
harboring small hairpin RNAs (shRNA). The following retroviral
vectors were used in these experiments: pBabePuro-p53
(Addgene), expressing DN-p53 (17), and pLNCX-GFP (Clontech
Laboratories Inc.) as previously described (18).
Cell viability assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates or culture dishes and
treated with ABT-737. Cell growth was determined by a 3-(4,5dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay (Sigma-Aldrich) using a microplate reader.
The percentage of viable cells was evaluated by trypan blue
exclusion assay as previously described (8). For clonogenic
assays, cells were plated at 1,000 cells per well and cultured in
medium with 0, 1, 5, 10 mmol/L of ABT-737 for 2 to 3 weeks.
The cells were stained with crystal violet (19).
BrdU assay
Cell proliferation assays was performed using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation assay kit (CalBiochem). After 24
hours of BrdU labeling, the relative and background signal was
assessed by using a fluorescent plate reader (Synergy 2, BioTek).
IL-6 and IL-8 ELISA, and SA-b-gal assay
Cells (1  105) were plated and after 24 hours, fresh medium
was added. Conditioned medium was collected following
treatment and used at a 2:1 dilution in the human interleukin-6 (IL-6) or IL-8 ELISA Kit (R&D Systems) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. SA-b-gal activity was determined
using a SA-b-gal staining kit from Cell Signaling Technology
according to the manufacturer's instruction. Senescent cells
were identified as blue-stained cells by standard light micro-

ABT-737 induces the transcriptional activation of IL-6
and IL-8

resistant to the proapoptotic activity of ABT-737. To examine
changes in gene transcription after ABT-737 treatment of PV-

10 cells, which are a kidney cancer cell line resistant to
apoptosis induced by this agent, we carried out microarray
analysis using an Affymetrix human gene chip (U133 Plus 2.0
Array) with mRNA from cells either treated with vehicle or
ABT-737 for 24 hours. Our analysis of these results revealed
that more than 430 genes were significantly changed (>2-fold,
P < 0.05) either up or down after exposure to ABT-737
(Fig. 1A). Genes that are regulated more than 4-fold by
ABT-737 are shown in (Supplementary Table S1). IL-6, IL-8,
and IL-11 and chemokines CXCL2 and CXCL5 and other
secreted cytokines/chemokines are induced more than 2-fold
(Fig. 1B). Quantitative real-time PCR (qT-PCR) analysis of IL-6
and IL-8 showed that ABT-737, but not its inactive enantiomer, was able to induce changes in mRNA levels confirming
the microarray analysis (Fig. 1C). Significant increases in other
mRNA transcripts including IL-11, CXCL2, CXCL5, IRF1, and
GADD45A were also confirmed by qT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1). To further validate gene changes shown in
the microarray analysis, we also included genes that are
downregulated by ABT-737 treatment. QT-PCR analysis confirmed that ABT-737 inhibited expression of inhibitor of
differentiation 2 (ID2) and ID3 transcripts (Supplementary
Fig. S1). To determine whether the change in IL-6 and IL-8
mRNA levels is mirrored with a change in the protein produced, we performed an ELISA assays. Secretion of IL-6 and
IL-8 protein was both increased in PV-10 cells in response to
ABT-737 treatment (Fig. 1D). To examine whether these gene
changes were seen in other cell lines after ABT-737 treatment,

we studied the effect of ABT-737 on 6 additional cancer lines, 4
renal cancer cell lines, KRC/Y, KV-6, CAKI, and 786-0, and
2 lung cancer cell lines, A549 and HOP-62. In all of these cell
lines with only minor exceptions, ABT-737 was able to induce
IL-6 and IL-8 and downregulate ID2 and ID3 transcripts
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Pathway analysis shows marked
changes in genes associated with protein binding, signal
transduction, apoptosis in addition to changes in cytokine
activity, and inflammatory response mediators.
Gene microarray analysis revealed that ABT-737 induced a
significant increases in the transcription factor CCAAT/
enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPb; Fig. 1B). Consistent
with these results, qT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed
significant induction of C/EBPb mRNA and protein levels in
PV-10 cells treated with ABT-737 (Fig. 2A and B). Because the
IL-6 promoter contains both C/EBPb and NF-kB binding sites,
we examined the possibility that activation of these 2 transcription factors played an important role in regulating
IL-6 mRNA levels. Previously, we had reported that NF-kB
promoter activity is increased by ABT-737 (8) and EMSA show
that ABT-737 treatment of PV-10 cells activates NF-kB activity
(Fig. 2C). We find that ABT-737 treatment, but not the inactive
enantiomer, of PV-10 cells was able to activate both the IL-6
and IL-8 promoters (Supplementary Fig. S3). Using a plasmid
in which the IL-6 promoter was cloned in front of a luciferase
reporter, mutation of either the C/EBPb or NF-kB sites

(Fig. 2D), blocked the transcriptional activation of this gene
by ABT-737. These DNA microarray results show that in a cell
line that does not undergo apoptosis after treatment ABT-737
is capable of inducing changes in gene transcription.
Irreversible cell cycle arrest and senescence is induced
by ABT-737 treatment
The induction of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL2, and CXCL5 and other
secreted proteins has been identified (13, 15) as associated
with the induction of cellular senescence. Senescent cells
secrete multiple factors that alter tissue microenvironments,
including the inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8
(13, 15, 21). These cytokines and chemokines function to
reinforce the senescent growth arrest through autocrine
and paracrine mechanisms (21, 22). The transcription factor
C/EBPb cooperates with IL-6 to amplify the activation of
inflammatory mediators, including IL-8 (15).
To test senescence induction, we first examined the effect of
ABT-737 on PV-10 cell growth. Long-term exposure of PV-10
cells to ABT-737 induced significant growth inhibition and a
G1/S cell cycle blockade (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S4).
Direct detection of apoptosis with Annexin V staining showed
that apoptotic cells were not significantly increased (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, a dose-dependent inhibition of
colony formation and an inhibition of BrdU incorporation was
seen after the addition of ABT-737 to both PV-10 and 22Rv1

cells (Fig. 3B and C). To test the possibility that cell growth
arrest in response to ABT-737 was caused by the induction of
cellular senescence, 5 human carcinoma cell lines including
PV-10 cells were exposed to ABT-737 followed by staining with
SA-b-gal, a marker of senescent cells. PV-10, A549, and 22Rv1
cells stained positively for this senescent marker whereas W138 cells, normal human fibroblasts, and DU145 human prostate cancer cells showed no response (Fig. 3D and E). Cells that
were positive for SA-b-gal showed a flattened and enlarged
morphology that was consistent with senescence. Although
the WI-38 cell line was resistant to ABT-737 induced senescence, g-irradiation (IR) caused senescence-like morphologic
changes in WI-38 human fibroblast cells, suggesting that ABT737 did not induce senescence in all cell lines.
DNA damage is induced by ABT-737
Overwhelming DNA damage leads to apoptosis, but lower
levels of damage have been suggested to be as a causal factor
in the induction of both cellular senescence and growth arrest
(23). To investigate whether ABT-737 induced lower levels of
DNA damage, we investigated the ability of this agent to
induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), followed by the
stimulation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinasedependent phosphorylation of the histone H2A variant H2AX,
g-H2AX (7). Western blot analysis revealed a time and dosedependent induction of both ATM phosphorylation and
g-H2AX in PV-10 cells, 22Rv1, and A549 cells (Fig. 4A and
B). Similar results were revealed by immunofluorescent staining of PV-10 cells showing that ABT-737 and DNA damaging

510

Cancer Res; 71(2) January 15, 2011

agents IR or doxorubicin (DXR) caused the induction of
g-H2AX (Supplementary Fig. S5). Recently, chromatin structures associated with modified histones, such as dimethylhistone H3 at Lys9 (H3K9m), were identified as a critical
feature of cellular senescence. During senescence H3K9m
increases and contributes to the transcriptional repression
of growth promoting genes found in senescence (24, 25). Using
an anti-H3K9m antibody to stain treated and untreated cells,
immunofluorescence microscopy shows that ABT-737, as well
as DXR and IR, induced this histone modification (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To test the role of the ATM protein kinase as a mediator of
the induction of senescence by ABT-737, we infected PV-10 and
22Rv1 cells with lentiviruses encoding short hairpin microRNA
targeting ATM (shRNAmir-ATM). The initiation and maintenance of senescence-associated cytokine secretion requires the
DNA damage response proteins, including ATM kinase, nijmegen breakage syndrome 1, and check point kinase 2 (26). In a
pool of PV-10 cells ATM levels were decreased by shRNA, we
found that a marked reduction in ATM levels prevented ABT737 from inducing g-H2AX (Fig. 4C). Moreover, ABT-737 treatment of cells with lower levels of ATM protein kinase caused
a markedly reduced level of SA-b-Gal and senescence-like
morphologic changes (Fig. 4D). To examine whether the induction of DSBs followed by ATM activation was the driving force
behind the ABT-737–mediated senescence induction of
IL-6 and IL-8, we measured levels of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA in
PV-10-shRNAmir-ATM and PV-10-shRNAmir-control cells.
QT-PCR analysis showed that ATM knockdown prevented

the ABT-737–mediated induction of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Similar results were observed in
22Rv1 prostate cancer cells depleted of ATM. These findings
support the concept that activation of ATM by ABT-737induced DNA damage signals the induction of senescence
leading to an increase in IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA.
Contribution of caspase-3 cleavage to DNA damage
response and senescence
To examine whether the DNA damage response caused by
ABT-737 occurs as a result of activation of the caspase cascade
or was secondary to an off-target direct effect of this drug, we
treated cells with z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor. As a
positive control, in these experiments we added TRAIL to
ABT-737, a combination we have previously showed is highly
synergistic and induces caspase activation and apoptosis (8).
When PV-10 cells were treated with ABT-737, caspase-3 (p32
precursor) is processed into 1 inactive (p24) and 2 active (p20
and p17) cleavage fragments. The cleaved subunit of caspase-3
generated in response to ABT-737 is insufficient to further
process poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a substrate
commonly cleaved during apoptosis. However, the g-H2AX
induction by ABT-737 correlated with caspase-3 cleavage,

www.aacrjournals.org

suggesting the possibility that caspase-3 cleavage induced
by ABT-737 might be the cause of the DNA damage response
(Fig. 5A). Because z-VAD-Fmk is not a specific caspase-3
inhibitor, we depleted caspase-3 levels in PV-10 and 22Rv1
cells with lentiviral infection of shRNAmir against caspase-3,
and examined the ability of ABT-737 to induce senescence.
Western blot analysis confirmed in both PV-10 and 22Rv1 cells
that partial knockdown of caspase-3 expression inhibited the
ABT-737 induction of g-H2AX (Fig. 5B). To initiate DSBs,
caspase-3 results in the activation of caspase-activated DNase
(CAD) by cleaving its inhibitor ICAD (27). We show that ABT737 treatment of PV-10 cells induced ICAD cleavage, which
was absent in caspase-3 knockdown cells (Fig. 5C). Exposure
of ABT-737 to cells with decreased caspase-3 expression
induced a reduced percentage of SA-b-gal–positive cells compared with those cells treated with shRNAmir-control
(Fig. 5D). QT-PCR analysis also showed that caspase-3 knockdown prevented the ABT-737–mediated induction of IL-6 and
IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 5E). These results support the hypothesis that
ABT-737 produced insufficient levels of cleaved caspase-3 to
drive apoptosis, but sufficient levels to cause the DNA
damage-mediated induction of senescence and induction
IL-6 and IL-8 (13, 15, 26).

inducer of senescence, we evaluated whether treatment of PV10 and 22Rv1 cells with ABT-737 might increase oxidative
stress. ROS levels, as assessed by dichlorofluorescein, after
ABT-737 treatment of both PV-10 and 22Rv1 cells were
increased (Fig. 6A), and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a precursor
of intracellular glutathione, prevented this ROS increase. NAC
also partially blocked ABT-737–mediated cleavage of caspase3 and ICAD suggesting that activation of caspase-3 and DNA
damage is in part due to the elevation of ROS (Fig. 6B).

Consistent with the role of DNA damage in the induction
of senescence, NAC treatment also reduced percentages of SAb-gal–positive cells (Fig. 6C).
Requirement for the activation of p53 and induction of
p21 in ABT-737–driven senescence
Both DNA damage and the induction of senescence are
associated with the activation of p53 and the transcription of
genes, such as p21 (28). Increases in cell cycle inhibitor p21
and p16 gene transcription are thought to play a critical role in
the mechanism by which cells undergo senescence (29, 30).
Both PV-10 and 22Rv1 cells when treated with ABT-737 show
increased levels of both wild-type p53 and p21 protein levels
(Fig. 7A), but no change in p16 mRNA levels (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). As predicted from the changes in p53, the upregulation of p21 protein levels occurred at the transcriptional level
and the enantiomer had no activity in regulating p21 (Fig. 7B).
To examine whether ABT-737—induced increases in p21
levels could account for the growth arrest seen after treatment, we measured the effect of ABT-737 on the activity of the
Cdk2 protein, a kinase that plays an important role both in
controlling the G1/S transition, and has a clear impact on the
induction of oncogene-induced senescence (31). The Cdk2
kinase was immunoprecipitated from treated cells and incubated with histone H1 as a substrate. We find that ABT-737
treatment inhibits Cdk2 activity in a dose-dependent fashion
in both PV-10 and 22Rv1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7).
To examine whether the p53 pathway is essential for the
induction of senescence, we generated a pool of 22Rv1 cells
expressing dominant-negative p53 (DN p53; rev. 17). Western
blot analysis confirmed that after ABT-737 treatment overexpression of DN p53 caused a substantial reduction in p21
(Fig. 7C) and inhibited the ability of ABT-737 to induce SAb-Gal (Fig. 7D). As a result of DN p53 expression, ABT-737
induction of increases in the IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA were
also significantly reduced (Fig. 7E). To show whether changes
in IL-6 and IL-8 are necessary for ABT-737 induction of
senescence, C/EBPb protein was ablated by siRNA-treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S8). QT-PCR analysis of these cells with
C/EBPb knockdown showed that the ABT-737–mediated
induction of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels was significantly
reduced (Supplementary Fig. S8). Similarly, senescence as
measured by SA-b-gal staining induced by ABT-737 was also
reduced by decreasing C/EBPb levels (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Together, these results indicate a model whereby ABT-737
induces a signaling cascade including changes in ROS/Caspase-3/DDR/p53/p21/IL-6/IL-8 that leads to cancer cell senescence (Fig. 7F).

Discussion
We show that the addition of ABT-737 to cancer cell lines
that do not undergo apoptosis (8) inhibits cancer cell proliferation associated with the induction of the senescent
phenotype. The induction of senescence in both normal
and cancerous cell types occurs with marked changes in gene
transcription and protein secretion (13) including significant
secretion of cytokines and chemokines normally associated

with the inflammatory response. Likewise, we have found that
the application of ABT-737 to PV-10 kidney cancer cells
regulated the transcription of more than 400 genes, many
of which are associated with an "inflammatory" phenotype (15,
21). We have identified marked increases in IL-6 and IL-8
driven by changes in the levels of the C/EBPb transcription
factor, mimicking defined events delineated in oncogeneinduced and other types of senescence (13, 32). The senescent
phenotype was further shown by the induction of SA-b-gal
staining, a flattened morphology, a marked decrease in BrdU
incorporation, and a G1/S cell cycle blockade. Together these

results show that in a solid tumor cell lines cells that do not
undergo apoptosis after ABT-737 treatment, this compound is
capable of inducing senescence.
We propose that ABT-737, although not inducing apoptotic
levels of DNA damage, is capable of inducing low levels of DNA
damage as measured by increases in g-H2AX and ATM
phosphorylation. Both the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VADFMK and expression of a shRNA specific to caspase-3 blocked
the ability of ABT-737 to induce gH2AX, showing that
activation of this caspase by ABT-737 was essential to the
induction of DNA damage. Activation of caspase-3 has been

implicated in specific gene regulation, for example, in the
repression of CD28 expression in aging lymphocytes (33).
More recently, activation of both CAD and caspase-3 have
been shown to be necessary for myoblast differentiation and
to induce p21 mRNA transcription (34). Caspase activation
was sufficient to induce biologic changes, but insufficient to
induce apoptosis. Activation of ROS production has been
associated both with the regulation of caspase-3 activity
and the induction of senescence (35, 36). As suggested by
the ability of NAC to partially block both caspase-3 activation
and senescence, the addition of ABT-737 to these tumor cells
ROS plays a role in low level caspase-3 activation. Similarly, it
has been reported that peroxynitrite leads to senescence of red
blood cells through caspase-3 activation (37). Very low doses
of g-radiation induce only transient DNA damage that is
quickly repaired. Higher doses of radiation are needed for
prolonged DNA-damage that then leads to the induction of
senescence-associated markers (26), and still higher doses are
needed to induce cell death. Finally, the amount and extent of
DNA damage has been linked to the ability of cells to increase
the secretion of the immune mediator cytokines/chemokines
associated with senescence (38), similar to what is seen here.
Increases in p21 is an essential control point in senescence
(30) not only because modulation of this protein blocks cyclindependent protein kinases, but also because p21 regulates the
transcriptional activation of multiple genes necessary for the
induction of the senescent phenotype (39). In multiple tumor
types, activation of the p53 (40) has been shown to be essential
for the induction of senescence. Using overexpression of

dominant-negative p53, we show that the p53 pathway is also
necessary for ABT-737 senescence in the 22Rv1 prostate
tumor cells. Other DNA damaging agents require p53 as an
essential mediator of senescence (41). On the basis of our
experiments, we hypothesize that treatment of p53-positive
solid tumor patients with ABT-737, or its oral counterpart
ABT-263, may yield significant stable disease based on the
induction of cellular senescence. Future human clinical trials
will be needed to evaluate this important possibility.
