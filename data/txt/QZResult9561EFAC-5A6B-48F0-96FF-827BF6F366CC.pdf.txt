enhances tumor growth in mice. Conversely, dietary restriction of
arginine inhibits growth of metastatic tumor (2). Arginine is an
indispensable amino acid to children but a semi-essential amino
acid in adult humans, involved in the synthesis of a wide range of
peptides and proteins, production of creatine and nitric oxide, and
a myriad of metabolic pathways and cellular events (3). It is also a
precursor of proline, polyamines, glutamine, glutamate, and other
neurotransmitters, such as g-aminobutyric acid. It also serves as a
substrate for two important enzymes, arginase and nitric oxide
synthetase.
The body obtains arginine from various sources, including
dietary intake, muscle degradation with the proteosomal/ubiquitin
pathway, and the ‘‘intestinal-renal axis.’’ In the small bowel, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) catalyzes the synthesis of citrulline
from ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate. In turn, this citrulline is
converted to arginine in the proximal renal tubules by argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), the
so called ‘‘intestinal-renal axis,’’ which accounts for up to 60% of all
arginine endogenously generated in humans. OTC is expressed
largely in the small bowel and liver. Despite its high degree of
versatility within the cell, arginine is still regarded as a semiessential amino acid in adult humans because somatic cells can
synthesize it from citrulline via ASS and ASL, both of which are
ubiquitous in somatic cells (1). This is because demand outstrips
supply at certain times during growth and development; equally,
the growth of a tumor can become a stress, which is relieved by
supplementation of arginine (4).
The arginine-degrading enzyme in the urea cycle is arginase, the
in vitro anticancer property of which has been well documented
since the 1960s (5). Arginase enzymatically converts arginine to
ornithine and urea. Currie et al. (6) showed that arginase released
from lipopolyssacharide and zymosan-stimulated macrophages can
be responsible for the death of V79 Chinese hamster lung cells,
L5178Y lymphoma cells, and HSN hooded rat sarcoma in culture.
Using murine and bovine liver arginases, Storr and Burton (7)
showed the total destruction of lymphosarcoma cells when
arginine was reduced to <8 Amol/L over 24 h. In vitro arginine
depletion, either through arginase or preparation of arginine-free
medium, leads to rapid tumor death in a wide range of tumor cell
lines (7).
Another potent arginine-depleting enzyme is arginine deiminase
(ADI), which is a microbial enzyme from Mycoplasma spp. The
enzyme has both anti–hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; ref. 8) and
anti–malignant melanoma (4) properties. The pegylated form of
ADI is now in phase II clinical trial stage, showing its strong
anticancer activities against HCC and malignant melanoma (9, 10).
These tumors are often dependent on exogenous arginine for

Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is believed to be auxotrophic
for arginine through the lack of expression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). The successful use of the arginine-depleting enzyme arginine deiminase (ADI) to treat
ASS-deficient tumors has opened up new possibilities for
effective cancer therapy. Nevertheless, many ASS-positive HCC
cell lines are found to be resistant to ADI treatment, although
most require arginine for proliferation. Thus far, an argininedepleting enzyme for killing ASS-positive tumors has not been
reported. Here, we provide direct evidence that recombinant
human arginase (rhArg) inhibits ASS-positive HCCs. All the
five human HCC cell lines we used were sensitive to rhArg but
ADI had virtually no effect on these cells. They all expressed
ASS, but not ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the enzyme
that converts ornithine, the product of degradation of
arginine with rhArg, to citrulline, which is converted back to
arginine via ASS. Transfection of HCC cells with OTC resulted
in resistance to rhArg. Thus, OTC expression alone may be
sufficient to induce rhArg resistance in ASS-positive HCC cells.
This surprising correlation between the lack of OTC expression and sensitivity of ASS-positive HCC cells shows that OTCdeficient HCCs are sensitive to rhArg-mediated arginine
depletion. Therefore, pretreatment tumor gene expression
profiling of ASS and OTC could aid in predicting tumor
response to arginine depletion with arginine-depleting
enzymes. We have also shown that the rhArg native enzyme
and the pegylated rhArg (rhArg-peg5,000mw) gave similar
anticancer efficacy in vitro. Furthermore, the growth of the
OTC-deficient Hep3B tumor cells (ASS-positive and ADIresistant) in mice was inhibited by treatment with rhArgpeg5,000mw, which is active alone and is synergistic in
combination with 5-fluorouracil. Thus, our data suggest that
rhArg-peg5,000mw is a novel agent for effective cancer therapy.

Cancer Research

Using our rhArg and pegylated rhArg, we have done experiments
to (a) compare the in vitro antitumor activities between rhArg and
pegylated rhArg; (b) compare the in vitro antitumor activity of the
rhArg native enzyme with that of the ADI native enzyme; (c) work
out why some cancer cell lines are rhArg sensitive but ADI resistant
in vitro; and (d) test the in vivo antitumor activity of rhArgpeg5,000mw, alone and in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), in
nude mice bearing an ADI-resistant HCC xenograft. The questions
‘‘Is rhArg able to inhibit ASS-positive HCCs that cannot be treated
by ADI?’’ and ‘‘Is rhArg-peg5,000mw an effective anticancer agent?’’
have been investigated in this report.

growth because the cells generally cannot internally synthesize
arginine (i.e., they are, or become, auxotrophic for arginine). The
mechanism of arginine auxotrophy in these tumors is likely to be
complex but primarily seems to be related to the down-regulation
of the ASS gene at the transcriptional level by inhibition of its
promoter sequence through methylation (11). This selective differential requirement in arginine between most somatic cells and
tumor cells, which are auxotrophic for arginine, provides a rational
basis that can be thoroughly exploited to develop new treatment
methods not just for HCC and malignant melanoma but also for
many types of malignancies (9–11).
ASS is a key enzyme in the synthesis of arginine from citrulline.
Tumors (mainly malignant melanoma and HCC) that are sensitive
to arginine depletion by ADI do not express ASS (4, 12, 13). Shen
et al. (14) reported that many cell lines are resistant to ADI
treatment, although most require arginine for proliferation. Their
results indicate that resistance to ADI treatment may correlate
with cellular ASS activity, either constitutive or inducible, allowing
cell survival by conversion of the product of the ADI reaction (i.e.,
citrulline to arginine). Wheatley (15) suggested that the enzymes
involved in converting arginine from citrulline (ASS and ASL) are
tightly coupled, and in cultured cells, ornithine cannot be sent on
round the urea cycle and, hence, is an end product except in
some freshly isolated liver cells or some minimum deviation
hepatomas.
Arginase converts arginine to ornithine and urea. Despite its
strong in vitro anticancer properties, arginase was never seriously
considered as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of
human cancers for several reasons, including its much lower
affinity for arginine (K m, 6 mmol/L for the native enzyme; K m, 12
mmol/L for the pegylated enzyme) at physiologic pH (16), a pH
optimum of 9.6, and short circulatory half-life (a few minutes).
These have been considered serious shortcomings since the 1980s,
with the report from Savoca et al. (17) who observed no antitumor
activity of bovine liver arginase in mice with Taper liver cancer.
Other investigators also gave very negative reports on arginase (18).
It is important to recognize, however, that these in vivo data were
generated with bovine and murine arginases, which have different
biochemical properties compared with the human liver arginase.
Nowadays, one can use recombinant human arginase, which was
not available for study until the advent of recombinant DNA
technology (19).
We have previously shown (20) that arginine depletion with
endogenous human hepatic arginase released from transhepatic
arterial embolization could induce a systemic anti-HCC response.
This convinced us that recombinant human arginase (rhArg)
given exogenously, after suitable modification to lengthen its halflife such as pegylation, could induce a similar antitumor response.
In the present study, the use of rhArg produced in a Bacillus
subtilis expression system (21) is described. The isolated and
purified enzyme is covalently attached via a succinamide
propionic acid (SPA) linker to polyethylene glycol (PEG) of
molecular weight 5,000. Unlike many other pegylated enzymes,
this pegylated rhArg (rhArg-peg5,000mw) was fully active. The K m
value for arginine as the substrate of the pegylated rhArg was also
much smaller (K m = 2.9 mmol/L) than that of the pegylated
bovine liver arginase (K m = 12 mmol/L). Subsequently, the
pegylated rhArg was found to have an in vivo half-life of f3
days while maintaining sufficient enzyme catalytic activity at
physiologic pH. The biochemical characteristics as well as the
production methods have already been reported (21).

Materials and Methods
Materials. Materials not specified here were obtained from Sigma
Chemical Company (St. Luis, MO). Cell proliferation kit with 3-(4,5dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) reagent was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). All cell
culture media and sera were purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Inc. (San Diego, CA). Expression plasmid pcDNA3 was from Invitrogen (San
Diego, CA). The Mycoplasma arginini ADI native enzyme was generously
provided by Professor B.H. Min (Department of Pharmacology and BK21
Program for Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul,
South Korea). Methoxypolyethylene glycol succinimidyl propionate (mPEGSPA; MW 5,000) was purchased from Nektar Therapeutics (Huntsville, AL).
The cell line Huh7 was provided by Professor R. Poon (Department of
Surgery, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong,
China). All other cancer cell lines were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The details of the cell lines are as
follows: HepG2 (HBV-negative hepatoblastoma, HB-8065); Hep3B (HBsAgpositive HCC, HB-8064); PLC/PRF/5 (primary hepatoma cells, contain
hepatitis B, express hepatitis B virus surface antigen, CRL-8024); SK-HEP-1
(liver adenocarcinoma, HTB-52); Huh7 (well-differentiated HBsAg-negative
HCC); A549 (lung carcinoma, CCL-185); WiDr (colorectal adenocarcinoma,
CCL-218); SK-MEL-28 (malignant melanoma, HTB-72); and HeLa (cervix
adenocarcinoma, CCL-2).
Preparation of rhArg and rhArg-peg5,000mw. Recombinant human
arginase (rhArg) was obtained by producing the His-tagged human arginase
I (liver arginase) enzyme in B. subtilis (21). A coupled spectrophotometric
assay was used to determine arginase activity as described by Ikemoto et al.
(22). The specific activity of the purified enzyme was f400 IU/mg protein.
One international unit of arginase is defined as the amount of enzyme that
can produce 1 Amol urea/min at 30jC, pH 8.5.
The purified enzyme (native rhArg) was used directly for conjugation
with PEG as follows: mPEG-SPA of MW 5,000 was covalently attached to
arginase with the same methods that were used for formulating ADI with
PEG (12). The resulting PEG-formulated (pegylated) arginase was termed
rhArg-peg5,000mw (Fig. 1). Only the purified M. arginini ADI (23) native
enzyme (without pegylation) was used in our studies. The specific activity of
the purified ADI was f46 units/mg protein. One unit of the ADI native
enzyme is the amount of enzyme activity that converts 1 Amol of arginine to
1 Amol of citrulline per minute at 37jC under the assay conditions (23).
To determine the number of PEG per arginase molecule, a PEG standard
curve was constructed by the colorimetric assay as described by Nag et al.
(24). Briefly, free PEG was detached from rhArg-peg5000mw by incubating
with proteinase. The amount of free PEG in the resulting mixture was
determined by comparing to the PEG standard curve. The number of PEG
molecules attached to the primary amines of arginase was calculated by the
mole ratio of free PEG and rhArg-peg5,000mw. The number of PEG per rhArg
was estimated to be 10 to 12.
Cell culture and cell proliferation assay. The cells were maintained
either in DMEM or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin. Cells (2.5  103) in a
volume of 100 AL of culture medium were seeded to each well of a 96-well
plate and incubated for 24 h. The culture medium was replaced by medium

OTC expression construct. The coding region of the OTC gene was
amplified from the Marathon’s liver cDNA library (Clontech) at an annealing
temperature of 60jC with oligonucleotides 1 and 2, which contain the
recognition sites for restriction enzymes HindIII and EcoRI, respectively
(underlined): oligo 1, 5¶-CCCAAGCTTATGAGGGCATAGAATCGT-3¶; oligo 2,
5¶-CCGGAATTCCTACCAACATTGCTTCTTTCT-3¶.
The PCR product was digested with HindIII and EcoRI and ligated into
HindIII/EcoRI–digested pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) to yield the OTC
expression plasmid pcDNA3-OTC. The plasmid was then introduced into
HCC cells by lipofection as follows: cells were plated 24 h before
transfection to reach 60% to 80% confluence in 12-well plates. Plasmid
DNA (1 Ag), prepared using an endotoxin-free plasmid purification kit
(Promega), was mixed with 4 AL of TransFectin Reagent (Bio-Rad) and
incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA/TransFectin
complexes were directly added to cells in serum-containing medium.
Following 6 h of incubation, the transfection medium was removed and the
complete medium was added. The expression of the OTC gene in
transfected HCC cells was verified by RT-PCR analysis using the primers
described above. These transfected cells were then analyzed again for
sensitivity to rhArg-peg5,000mw treatment for 3 days with MTS reagent.
OTC enzyme activity assay. Cells were harvested, washed, and
suspended in 0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Extraction of cell proteins was
accomplished by incubating the cells with CelLytic MT reagent (Sigma) for
15 min on a shaker. Cell lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was
transferred to clean tubes on ice. OTC activity was measured as the rate of
citrulline formation from ornithine and carbamyl phosphate as described by
Marshall and Cohen (25). Briefly, the standard assay mixture (3 mL)
contained 8 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 5 mmol/L ornithine, 5 mmol/L
carbamoyl phosphate, and cell extract. The ornithine and carbamyl
phosphate solutions were prepared just before use. The reaction was
started by adding the carbamoyl phosphate solution and was allowed to
continue for 15 min at 37jC. Subsequently, the reaction was stopped by the
addition of 3 mL of 6.25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution. The
concentration of citrulline in the mixture was measured by adding 1 mL
of the test solution into 2,3-butanedione monoxime/acid solution (1:3, v/v).
They were mixed by swirling and the tubes were transferred to boiling water
bath and incubated for 20 min. Distilled water (8 mL) was added and
absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Standard curves were constructed by
appropriately diluting a stock solution of citrulline. One unit of OTC would
form 1 Amol of citrulline from ornithine and carbamyl phosphate per
minute at pH 8.5 and 37jC.
Pharmacodynamics of rhArg-peg5,000mw. Sprague-Dawley rats were
obtained from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shatin, Hong Kong) for
use in the pharmacodynamic studies. Normal Sprague-Dawley rats ( four
females and four males), f3 months old (average body weight, f250 g),
were recruited and were randomly assigned into groups. Different dosages
of rhArg-peg5,000mw (500, 1,000, 1,500, and 3,000 IU per rat) were given i.p. on
day 0. Blood samples were drawn from their tail veins on day 0 before the
i.p. injection of rhArg-peg5,000mw, as baseline, on days 1 to 6, and then every
2 days. Blood was collected in EDTA and mixed with 50% trichloroacetic
acid for precipitation of protein by incubating on ice for 30 min. The
samples were centrifuged at 13,000  g for 15 min, and arginine level in the
clear supernatant fraction was analyzed by high-speed amino acid analyzer
(model L-8800, Hitachi). The plasma arginine levels at the indicated time
points were determined using the amino acid analyzer as described by
Cheng et al. (20).
Implantation of tumor cells in nude mice. The BALB/c nude mice
used in this study were obtained from the Chinese University of Hong
Kong and were all males, 3 weeks old (average body weight, f20 g), at the
beginning of the study. They were used in the in vivo drug efficacy tests
of rhArg-peg5,000mw. They were provided with standard mouse chow
and water ad libitum. Hep3B cells were removed from the tissue culture
flasks with trypsin in Dulbecco’s PBS (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and
resuspended in growth medium. Approximately 1 million cells were
injected s.c. near the right axilla of each mouse. Once the initial solid
tumor was established in mice, it was then maintained by serial passage
of 30 to 40 mg of tumor fragments implanted s.c. near the axilla. When

with varying concentrations of either rhArg (native or pegylated) or the ADI
native enzyme. The plates were incubated for an additional 3 or 7 days at
37jC in an incubator containing an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.
Then, 0.02 mL of MTS reagent was added to each well and the plates were
incubated for another 4 h. The absorbance of the wells at 490 nm was then
determined. The amount of rhArg, native or pegylated, needed to kill 50% of
the cells in a culture was defined as IC50. We used the CellTiter 96 AQueous
Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay from Promega, which is a colorimetric method for determining the number of viable cells in proliferation
assays. MTS is chemically reduced by cells to formazan, which is soluble
in tissue culture medium. The measurement of the absorbance of the
formazan can be carried out at 490 nm. The assay measures dehydrogenase
enzyme activity found in metabolically active cells.
Amino acid analysis. Cell culture medium after treatment was collected
and mixed with 50% trichloroacetic acid for precipitation of protein by
incubating on ice for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000  g
for 15 min, and arginine and ornithine levels were analyzed by high-speed
amino acid analyzer (model L-8800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction and was previously described (20). Briefly, measurements were done with an ion-exchange column, reactor temperature
at 135jC, and photometer at 570 nm for detection.
Reverse transcription-PCR studies. Total RNA was extracted from
cancer cell lines grown in culture using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. For reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), the RNA was first reverse transcribed into
cDNA by iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 5 Ag of total RNA were subjected
to reverse transcription at 42jC for 30 min. A 2-AL portion of cDNA was
then amplified using 50 AL of reaction mixture containing 0.5 unit of iTaq
DNA polymerase (Bio-Rad). PCR was done in a DNA thermal MyCycler
(Bio-Rad). The following flanking primers were used: ASS-S, 5¶-GGGGTCCCTGTGAAGGTGACC-3¶ [from 688 to 708 nucleotides (nt)]; ASS-AS,
5¶-CGTTCATGCTCACCAGCTC-3¶ ( from 1,117 to 1,136 nt); ASL-S, 5¶TGATGCCCCAGAAGAAAAACC-3¶ ( from 848 to 868 nt); ASL-AS, 5¶CATCCCTTTGCGGACCAGGTA-3¶ ( from 1,126 to 1,146 nt); OTC-S,
5¶-TTTTCAAGGGCATAGAATCGTC-3¶ ( from 17 to 38 nt); OTC-AS,
5¶-CTTTTCCCCATAAACCAACTCA-3¶ ( from 1,248 to 1,269 nt).
The reaction products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
After electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide, all PCR product
band intensities were analyzed by Lumi-Imager (Boehringer Mannheim,
Indianapolis, IN), and the relative mRNA expression levels were estimated
by normalization with h-actin.

were then randomly divided into four groups (10 mice per group) and were

NOTE: The cells listed were grown in 96-well plates for 24 h and then challenged with 0 to 100 IU/mL of either the rhArg native enzyme or the rhArgpeg5,000mw pegylated enzyme. After additional 3 d of incubation, viability of the cells was determined using MTS reagent, and the IC50 values were
determined. Several other human tumor cell lines were tested by the same method, including a human colorectal (WiDr) and a human lung cancer
(A549), all of which were able to grow in the presence of 100 IU/mL, the highest concentration tested.

PLC/PRF/5, Huh7, and SK-HEP-1), as well as of four other cell lines
(HeLa, WiDr, A549, and SK-MEL-28), were measured by RT-PCR.
We were surprised that they all showed detectable and variable
amounts of ASS and ASL mRNA (Fig. 3A). However, the melanoma
cells (SK-MEL-28) did not produce detectable amount of ASS
mRNA, consistent with previously published data (12). Intriguingly,
OTC mRNA was not detected in most cell lines (Fig. 3A), except the
colorectal (WiDr) and lung cancer (A549) cell lines, which were
resistant to rhArg-peg5,000mw, even in the presence of high concentrations (100 IU/mL) of rhArg-peg5,000mw (Table 1). In addition,
OTC enzyme activity was undetectable in the cells that were
sensitive to rhArg-peg5,000mw. More importantly, OTC activity was
detected in WiDr and A549, consistent with the RT-PCR results
(Table 1). Thus, all OTC-negative cancer cell lines were much more
sensitive to both rhArg and rhArg-peg5,000mw than OTC-positive cell
lines and these cells exhibited a range of sensitivity to both rhArg
and rhArg-peg5,000mw, with IC50s ranging from 0.10 to 0.35 IU/mL
(or 0.35–1.23 Ag/mL).
OTC transfection of the HCC cell lines HepG2, PLC/PRF/5,
and Huh7 and reversal of sensitivity to rhArg-peg5,000mw. To
confirm that it was the deficiency of OTC that caused sensitivity to
rhArg or rhArg-peg5,000mw treatment, OTC mRNA-deficient cells
were transfected with an expression plasmid carrying the OTC
cDNA. Figure 3B clearly shows that OTC-transfected HepG2, PLC/
PRF/5, and Huh7 cell lines expressed the OTC gene. These cell lines
were grown in 96-well plates and incubated with rhArg-peg5,000mw
of various concentrations. After 3 days, the growth of the cells was

that of the rhArg native enzyme. Amino acid analysis of the culture
medium contents showed that arginine was decreased, corresponding to an increase in ornithine level, indicating efficient
enzymatic conversion of arginine to ornithine by rhArg-peg5,000mw
in the culture medium (Fig. 2A and B). Asparaginase, which is
currently used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
degrades both asparagines and glutamine (26). Its deleterious side
effects were due to its degradation of glutamine (27). In contrast,
the action of rhArg-peg5,000mw was specific in that we found no
evidence of degradation of other amino acids (data not shown).
Ensor et al. (12) had reported that native ADI and pegylated ADI
only degrade arginine but not other amino acids.
Inhibition of human HCC cell lines with the rhArg native
enzyme and the rhArg-peg5,000mw pegylated enzyme. Five HCC
cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5, Huh7, and SK-HEP-1) were
each incubated for 3 days with either native or pegylated rhArg to
test their in vitro sensitivities to the enzyme (Table 1). Strikingly, all
the HCC cell lines tested were sensitive to the rhArg native enzyme
in vitro with IC50 values between 0.10 and 0.25 IU/mL. Hep3B was
the most sensitive tumor with an IC50 of 0.10 IU/mL. Similar results
were seen when rhArg-peg5,000mw was used, indicating that both
the native rhArg and the pegylated rhArg (rhArg-peg5,000mw) have
similar antitumor efficacy in vitro. On the other hand, HeLa cells
(cervix adenocarcinoma) were also found to be sensitive to both
rhArg and rhArg-peg5,000mw with IC50 values between 0.28 and
0.35 IU/mL. However, a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line
(WiDr) and a human lung cancer cell line (A549) were resistant to
rhArg and rhArg-peg5,000mw treatment with IC50 values >100 IU/mL,
the highest concentration tested.
Next, we compared the in vitro efficacy of an established
arginine-depleting enzyme, the ADI native enzyme, with the rhArg
native enzyme on two HCC cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B) and a
melanoma cell line (SK-MEL-28; Table 2). Again, the rhArg native
enzyme was highly effective against these cell lines, with IC50 values
between 0.10 and 0.20 IU/mL (or 0.35 and 0.70 Ag/mL).
Unexpectedly, HepG2 and Hep3B were highly resistant to the ADI
native enzyme with IC50 values well over 10 IU/mL (or 217 Ag/mL).
On the other hand, the SK-MEL-28 melanoma cell line was
sensitive to ADI as well as to rhArg.

measured with the MTS reagent. The cells transfected with the
OTC gene were much more resistant to rhArg-peg5,000mw than the
untransfected parental cells in vitro (Table 3). This suggested that
OTC deficiency increased the sensitivity of these HCC cell lines to
rhArg-peg5,000mw treatment. The results indicate that OTC
expression alone may be sufficient to induce rhArg-peg5,000mw
resistance in ASS-positive HCC cells.
Pharmacodynamic study of rhArg-peg5,000mw in rats. The
effects of injection of rhArg-peg5,000mw on the plasma levels of
arginine (the pharmacodynamics) were determined by administering rhArg-peg5,000mw to rats. As shown in Fig. 4, rhArg-peg5,000mw
depleted the plasma arginine in rats in a dose-dependent manner.
Administration of rhArg-peg5,000mw resulted in an immediate
lowering of plasma arginine to zero on day 1 and, thereafter,
arginine levels returned to normal level in the next 10+ days. A dose
of 1,500 IU per rat (or 6 IU/g of rat) seemed to lower arginine levels
to about zero for 4 to 5 days. This was deemed as the weekly
optimal biological depletion dose for rats. As mice have a faster
metabolic rate than rats, we estimated the weekly optimal
biological depletion dose for mice to be approximately twice that
for rats [i.e., f250 IU per mouse (or 12 IU/g of mouse)].
Ensor et al. (12) reported that the circulation half-life of ADI
(a few hours) was prolonged by pegylation. The pegylated ADI had a
circulation half-life of a few days. Although the native ADI enzyme
and the pegylated ADI were similar in their ability to inhibit the
growth of melanoma and HCCs in vitro, only the pegylated ADI was
found to be effective in inhibiting the growth of these tumor cells
in vivo. It would seem that to achieve efficacy in vivo, serum arginine
levels must be maintained at low levels for some time.
In vivo efficacy of rhArg-peg 5,000mw on human HCC
implanted in mice. The in vivo efficacy of rhArg-peg5,000mw on
nude mice bearing human HCC xenograft was tested. The OTCdeficient Hep3B cell line (ASS-positive and ADI-resistant) was
chosen for this study. In the control group, saline was used and
progressive tumor growth was observed. In the treatment groups,
rhArg-peg5,000mw was found to have significant tumor-retarding
activity in Hep3B (Fig. 5), with early divergence of the tumor size
curves, which seemed to parallel each other after the second or
third week (P = 0.048). Intriguingly, the combination of 5-FU with
rhArg-peg5,000mw seemed to augment the tumor regression rate on
this HCC tested.

Of all the amino acids, essential and nonessential, depletion of
arginine causes the greatest havoc to the cells, in particular tumor
cells. Because of their intact ‘‘R’’ checkpoint in the G1 phase of the
cell cycle, normal cells generally enter into quiescence (G0) when
depleted of arginine, awaiting the return of favorable conditions
before resumption of normal cell division, a condition that many
cells can tolerate for weeks. Tumor cells, on the other hand, with
their defective ‘‘R’’ checkpoint or other cycle aberrations, continue
to cycle despite the absence of arginine, which leads to gross
imbalance and cell death (28). This is not unexpected because
arginine occupies an extremely important position in a myriad of
metabolic and enzymatic pathways (1).
For tumor cells in culture, total depletion of arginine is not
survivable. Arginine is also unique in that it can be resynthesized
by many somatic cells from citrulline. This is the built-in
alternative arginine source of the body to ensure its survival in
case the amino acid is in short supply or deficient (1). In vitro
arginine depletion, whether through an arginine-degrading enzyme,
such as arginase or ADI, or by using arginine-free medium, is
particularly tumoricidal in those tumors that are highly dependent
on exogenous arginine for growth (19). In vivo, enzymatic depletion
of arginine offers the most logical and relatively simple approach to

(9, 10), although it does have a number of shortcomings. First, it is
a bacterial enzyme and antigenicity may still be a problem despite
pegylation. In phase II studies that have been reported, autoantibodies were detected as early as the 5th week and continued to
increase with treatment (9, 10). This may potentially render the
drug ineffective on prolonged treatment. Second, ADI converts
arginine to citrulline and free ammonia, which could pose
problems in patients with cirrhosis liver and hepatic decompensation with further elevation of ammonia levels (33), leading to
prehepatic encephalopathy in man (9, 10, 19). Third, ADI product
citrulline is readily recyclable and rescues cells not only from

arginine depletion. HCC and malignant melanoma are often
auxotrophic for arginine (19). The mechanism of this arginine
auxotrophy has been amply described in a number of reports
(3, 15, 19, 29–31). In essence, these tumors reportedly lack ASS with
which to regenerate arginine, which is indispensable for growth.
This absolute dependence on exogenous arginine in these tumors
makes them particularly vulnerable to arginine depletion (19,
29, 31).
ADI in its pegylated form, ADI-SS PEG20,000mw (12, 32), has now
been shown to have in vitro and in vivo activities in HCC and
malignant melanoma as reported in the recent phase II studies

(12) reported that there was a relatively wide range of sensitivity to
ADI exhibited by ASS-negative cells, with IC50s ranging from <0.01
to 0.3 Ag/mL. Furthermore, our results showed that the rhArg IC50s
were 0.42 Ag/mL for melanoma (SK-MEL-28) and 0.35 to 0.70 Ag/
mL for HCCs (HepG2 and Hep3B). Therefore, rhArg inhibited both
melanoma and HCCs efficiently and it killed HCCs that could not
be killed by ADI.
The reason for the inability of ADI to kill the HCC cells was
immediately apparent from the gene profiles of these cell lines with
regard to their ASS and ASL gene expression. Contrary to
expectation, ASS levels were found to be uniformly present in all
the cell lines tested (Fig. 3A), except SK-MEL-28. This would
therefore explain the ineffectiveness of ADI on the HCC cell lines
that we selected for study. This positive expression of ASS also
indicated that the antitumor mechanism of rhArg and rhArgpeg5,000mw was independent of ASS expression. This turned our
attention to OTC, which catalyzes the conversion of ornithine to
citrulline. Again, we unexpectedly found that OTC mRNA was
absent in all the HCC cell lines (Fig. 3A) and OTC enzyme activity
was undetectable (Table 1). Because OTC is responsible for the
conversion of ornithine to citrulline, which is then converted to
arginine via ASS and ASL, one must conclude that these HCC cell
lines are auxotrophic for arginine because of their inherent lack of
OTC expression. Confirmation came by transfection with the OTC
gene into the HCC cell lines HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, and Huh7, with
the cell lines becoming resistant to arginine depletion with rhArgpeg5,000mw (Fig. 3B; Table 3). As a positive control, we also did
arginine depletion with rhArg-peg5,000mw on known OTC-positive
cell lines, WiDr (colorectal cancer) and A549 (lung cancer), both of
which are resistant to rhArg-peg5,000mw (Table 1). This opens up an
entirely new avenue for exploration with the burgeoning interest
being shown in arginine deprivation as a means of bringing cancer
cells under control, but it also calls for much more work on a wide
spectrum of cell lines, normal and transformed, as well as on tumor
biopsy samples, because information of the expression of this OTC
enzyme will give valuable information about which tumors will be
sensitive, as opposed to resistant, to a therapeutic procedure
involving arginine depletion.
In the case of ADI-sensitive tumors, Sugimura et al. (4) had
suggested that melanomas may be sensitive to ADI as a result of
their inability to express ASS. Furthermore, Ensor et al. (12)
reported that only the melanoma and HCC cell lines that lack
ASS mRNA were sensitive to killing by ADI. They also found that
cell lines that expressed ASS were resistant to ADI and were able
to grow even in the presence of large amounts (100 Ag/mL) of
ADI. Because citrulline is converted to arginine by the sequential
actions of ASS and ASL, an inability to express either enzyme
would be expected to result in arginine auxotrophy and sensitivity
to ADI. All the melanoma and HCC cell lines studied by Ensor
et al. (12) did not produce detectable amounts of ASS mRNA but
produced ASL mRNA. On the other hand, ornithine is converted
to arginine by the sequential actions of OTC, ASS, and ASL, and
all the cell lines tested thus far are ASL positive (Fig. 3A).
Therefore, an inability to express either OTC or ASS would be
expected to result in arginine auxotrophy and sensitivity to rhArg.
Thus far, it is not known why human HCCs are unable to express
OTC. It will be interesting to study the OTC gene structure and
the promoter region to understand the molecular details. The use
of pegylated rhArg to kill OTC-deficient, ASS-positive tumors has
opened up many anticancer drug research and development
possibilities.

arginine-free medium but also from arginase-induced deficiency
(34). This has led to the major limitation of ADI: it only kills cancer
cells that are ASS deficient (9–12). Many cell lines are ASS positive
and they are resistant to ADI treatment, although most require
arginine for proliferation (14, 35).
Arginase is a good enzyme to use to degrade arginine in culture
because its product is ornithine, which cannot be recycled to
arginine because the urea cycle is incomplete in most cultured cells
(34), but the mechanism for this phenomenon has been an
unresolved area. In our present studies, both native and pegylated
rhArg (Fig. 1) were highly active in vitro against all HCC cell lines,
with IC50 values <0.3 IU/mL (Table 1). At a concentration between
0.3 and 0.4 IU/mL, rhArg-peg5,000mw usually achieved maximal cell
kill within f72 h. However, it was apparent that not all the HCC
cell lines exhibited the same degree of sensitivity to rhArg, with
Hep3B being most sensitive (IC50, 0.10 IU/mL) and HepG2 least
sensitive (IC50, 0.24 IU/mL). Although the majority of the HCC cells
died within 72 h, it was also apparent that some residual cells were
still viable after this period of depletion. It is possible that once a
critical level of arginine depletion is achieved, all the sensitive
clones would have been totally annihilated, leaving behind residual
cells that are relatively resistant to arginine depletion. Even when
higher concentrations of arginase were added to complete the
arginine depletion, no further cell kill was observed. This is
consistent with our in vivo data (Fig. 5). When nude mice bearing
HCC xenograft were treated with rhArg-peg5,000mw, there was a
clear and rapid separation of the tumor size curves in the first 2 to
3 weeks, suggesting rapid killing of the sensitive clones. Thereafter,
the curves seemed to diverge more slowly, suggesting continuous
growth of a resistant clone of tumor cells. The mechanism of this
relative resistance to arginine depletion awaits further elucidation.
Conceptually, the addition of cycle-dependent drugs such as 5FU along with rhArg-peg5,000mw might augment the antitumor
effect of rhArg-peg5,000mw by eradicating some of the resistant
clones from the outset, in much the same way as acute
lymphoblastic leukemia is treated with L-asparaginase and other
cytotoxic agents (36). 5-FU also interferes with RNA and DNA synthesis (37). We used a very low concentration of 5-FU (10 mg/kg)
such that this drug alone could not inhibit tumor growth. We were
surprised that growth inhibition of HCC tumor cells was enhanced
by the combined treatment of pegylated rhArg and 5-FU (Fig. 5).
Arginase, in its pegylated form to enhance its arginine depletion
activity, could be used as a means to destabilize cancer cells
(in our case, HCC) so as to cause a perturbation in their cell
cycling. This could account for the enhanced activity of 5-FU
in vivo. The possible mechanisms of synergy will be investigated in
future studies. Thus, our data suggest that rhArg-peg5,000mw is a
novel agent for effective cancer therapy.
The efficacy of combination treatment has already been shown
with hydroxyurea given along with arginase (15). There are now
ongoing nude mice preclinical studies in our laboratory to test
different treatment chemotherapy combinations together with
rhArg-peg5,000mw to try and establish the most effective treatment
combination. These data could serve as the scientific basis for the
design of future phase III clinical studies.
When comparing the in vitro cytotoxic activities of the ADI
native enzyme with the rhArg native enzyme, it was surprising to
find that ADI was totally ineffective in all our HCC cell lines
whereas rhArg remained highly effective (Table 2). The ADI native
enzyme was effective on the SK-MEL-28 melanoma cell line,
indicating that the ADI we used was functionally active. Ensor et al.

Pegylated Arginase Inhibits Hepatocellular Carcinoma

In conclusion, we believe that the previous dogma that
arginase is a poor drug candidate has now been disproved by
our in vitro data as well as our in vivo HCC xenograft–bearing
nude mice treated with rhArg-peg5,000mw. RhArg-peg5,000mw is
potentially a better drug candidate than the pegylated ADI (ADISS PEG20,000mw) because of its predicted efficacy in both ASSnegative and OTC-negative tumors whereas ADI-SS PEG20,000mw
only works in ASS-negative tumors. RhArg-peg5,000mw may be a
safer drug candidate than ADI-SS PEG20,000mw with no free
ammonia as a side product. Being a pegylated human hepatic
enzyme, rhArg-peg5,000mw should be less immunogenic when
compared with ADI-SS PEG20,000mw. We hope our studies will
