BACKGROUND: To assess the potential mechanisms that may underlie increased local failure in triple negative (TN) breast cancers,
an analysis was performed of the risk of residual carcinoma after lumpectomy with correlation to pathologic factors, including molecular phenotype. METHODS: A review of pathologic specimens was performed for women with invasive breast cancer treated with
lumpectomy followed by reexcision. Data were collected on age; tumor size, grade, and nodal stage; estrogen receptor, progesterone
receptor, and human endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (Her2); extensive intraductal component; lymphovascular invasion; margins;
and reexcision findings. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate for associations between
pathologic features of the lumpectomy specimen and reexcision findings. Molecular phenotypes were defined by conventionally used
immunohistochemical pattern. RESULTS: Data were collected on 369 patients with breast cancer. The median age was 57 years, median tumor size was 1.5 cm, 36% had positive margins, 32% had positive lymph nodes, 73.5% had the luminal A subtype, 9.5% had the
luminal B subtype, 4.5% were Her2-enriched, and 12.5% were TN. Overall, 32% of patients had invasive cancer in their reexcision specimens, and 51% of those with the TN subtype had residual invasive disease on reexcision compared with 30% to 31% for other subtypes. On univariate analysis, age, tumor size, margin status, lymphovascular invasion, nodal status, and TN subtype were associated
with elevated risk of residual invasive cancer. On multivariate analysis using a forward stepwise model, TN subtype maintained significance, with an odds ratio of 3.28 (P ¼ .002). CONCLUSION: TN subtype has a statistically significant association with an increased
risk of residual tumor. This suggests the putative increase in the risk of local failure in TN patients may be related to increased residual

In 2000, Perou et al published a landmark study identifying breast cancer molecular subtypes by gene expression profiles.1
Over the past decade, the prognostic value of these subtypes has been validated in multiple datasets.2-4 The gene-expression–derived molecular subtypes can be approximated by immunohistochemical-defined molecular phenotypes using
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2). The marker
combinations that best matched the molecular profiles are 1) ER(þ) and/or PR(þ) and Her2() for luminal A subtype;
2) ER(þ) and/or PR(þ) and Her2(þ) for luminal B subtype; 3) ER() and PR() and Her2() for the basal-like subtype; and 4) ER() and PR() and Her2(þ) for the Her2-enriched subtype.5,6
Molecular phenotype has become increasingly valuable in guiding systemic treatment decisions. Yet, the impact of
molecular phenotype on local therapy has lagged, despite mounting evidence of an association between molecular phenotype and local recurrence (LR) or locoregional recurrence (LRR).7-11 Most reports find a low risk of LRR in the luminal
phenotypes and increased risk of LRR in the so-called triple negative (TN; ER-, PR-, and Her2-negative) and Her2enriched breast cancer phenotypes after breast conservation therapy, mastectomy with postmastectomy radiation therapy,
and accelerated partial breast irradiation.7-14 Although trastuzumab likely mitigates excess LR risk in the Her2-enriched
phenotype, the lack of targeted systemic agents for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), makes TN status in patients a
clinical challenge for surgical and radiation oncologists.
TNBCs disproportionately affect younger women, and thus the increased risk of local recurrence has been speculated
to be due to smaller, more cosmetically driven surgeries, poorer imaging quality in denser breasts, and/or differences in

wound-healing growth factors that are more conducive to
LR. Other explanations include radioresistance12 and
rapid proliferative rate of TNBC, resulting in a transiently
elevated LR rate during the early posttreatment period
that is overcome with longer follow-up.15
Here, we test the hypothesis that the higher risk of
LR in TNBC is due to increased microscopic invasive tumor burden after lumpectomy. The objective of our study
is to assess the risk of residual carcinoma after lumpectomy with correlation to multiple pathologic factors,
including molecular phenotype. Prior reexcision studies
that analyzed clinical and pathologic predictors for residual disease have reported correlation with age, margin status, and extensive intraductal component (EIC).16-18
However, the influence of molecular phenotype has not
been previously analyzed in this context and may illuminate the mechanism of increased LR in TNBC after
lumpectomy. From the analysis of reexcision data, our
ultimate objective is to establish whether molecular phenotype should be factored into local management decisions, specifically whether surgical reexcisions and
radiation dose should be tailored to the molecular phenotype of the tumor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective review of pathologic records was performed for women with invasive breast cancer who were
treated with lumpectomy followed by a second ipsilateral
breast surgery between 2001 and 2009 at Rhode Island
Hospital or Women and Infants Hospital, Providence,
Rhode Island. The second surgery had to occur within 3
months of the initial surgery and included reexcision or
mastectomy. The study period was begun in 2001,
because that is when fluorescence in situ hybridization
confirmation of Her2 intermediate score (2þ) became
reflexive. Data were collected on age, tumor size, grade,
mitotic count, status of margins, lymph nodes, ER, PR,
and Her2, as well as presence of EIC, lymphovascular
invasion (LVI), multifocality, and reexcision findings.
Although data was collected as continuous variables,
most of the variables were grouped into 2 or 3 categories
to facilitate analysis. An effort was made to keep most variables binary. Age was dichotomized as 45 years old or
>45 years old. Tumor size was divided into 3 groups:
1.0 cm (defined as the reference group), 1.1 to 2.0 cm,
and >2.0 cm. Grade 1 was defined as the reference group,
and grade 2 and grade 3 were analyzed separately in comparison to the reference group. High mitotic count was
defined as >10 mitoses per field size of 0.152 mm2. However, mitotic count was ultimately excluded from the anal3894

ysis because of the large number of missing data points (n
¼ 78). Positive LVI was defined as extensive or when
characterized as ‘‘presence of LVI not otherwise specified.’’ Focal, equivocal, and indeterminate LVI was classified as negative for LVI. EIC was defined as >25%
intraductal component. Multifocal disease was defined as
multiple pathologic foci of invasive carcinoma in the lumpectomy specimen. Positive surgical margin was defined
as one or more surgical margins with invasive disease present at the margin. Close or <1 mm margins were classified as negative. Lymph node involvement was defined as
any pathologic evidence of carcinoma >0.2 mm in 1 or
more lymph nodes. Molecular phenotypes were defined
by the following immunohistochemical patterns: Luminal
A ¼ ER(þ) and/or PR(þ) and Her2(). Luminal B ¼
ER(þ) and/or PR(þ) and Her2(þ). Her2-enriched ¼
ER(), PR(), and Her2(þ). TN ¼ ER(), PR(), and
Her2(). TN subtypes were analyzed in comparison to
non-TN subtypes (luminal A þ luminal B þ Her2enriched). Positive ER and PR status was defined as 5%
of tumor cell nuclei showing specific staining. Specific
membrane staining for c-erbB2 (HER2/neu) was reported
as positive, with the intensity of the staining observed
on a scale of 0 to 3. Intensity of 0 to 1þ was considered
negative, whereas 3þ staining was considered positive.
An intermediate score of 2þ was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization amplification. Residual disease
was defined as presence or absence of residual invasive
disease.
Patients with residual ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) were excluded from the analysis, and patients
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were also
excluded.
Statistical comparisons between groups were made
using the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and
the chi-square test for categorical variables. Univariate
relationships between age, tumor size, grade, LVI, multifocality, margin status, nodal status, and molecular phenotype with residual invasive carcinoma were analyzed
using a univariate linear regression model. A multivariate
logistic regression model was developed for residual invasive carcinoma using a forward stepwise process with a p
value for entry into the model of 0.05. Only patients with
complete data were included in the multivariate analysis.
All analyses were performed with the SAS system, version
9.2 for Windows. A probability level of alpha ¼ 0.05 was
used to determine statistical significance.
This study was performed under institutional review
board approval from Rhode Island Hospital, and Women
and Infants Hospital.

RESULTS
Pathologic records from 449 patients were reviewed.
Eighty patients had residual intraductal carcinoma and
were excluded, because the analysis was restricted to data
from 369 patients with or without residual invasive carcinoma. Descriptive statistics for the entire cohort are shown
in Table 1. The median age was 57 years, median tumor
size was 1.5 cm, 29% were high grade, 18% had a high mitotic count, 21% had evidence of LVI, 36% had EIC, 36%
had positive margins with respect to invasive carcinoma,
38% had close margins (2 mm) with respect to invasive
carcinoma, 70% had close or positive margins with respect
to intraductal carcinoma, 30% were multifocal, 32% had
positive lymph nodes, 73.5% were luminal A, 9.5% were
luminal B, 4.5% were Her2 enriched, and 12.5% were
TN. Overall, 32% had evidence of invasive cancer in their
reexcision specimens. Descriptive statistics by molecular
phenotype are shown in Table 2. TN phenotype was more
likely to have residual invasive carcinoma on reexcision:
51% compared to 30% among the luminal phenotype.

TN represented a younger population of women with a
median age of 50. TN phenotype was more likely to be
high grade and have a high mitotic count compared to the
luminal phenotypes. Margin status, size, and multifocality
were similar among the TN and luminal subtypes.
Univariate regression analysis results are shown in Table 3. On initial univariate analysis, after excluding patients
with residual DCIS, EIC did not maintain a statistically
significant correlation with residual invasive disease (P ¼
.79) and thus was not included in the final analysis. Otherwise, univariate analysis showed statistically significant
associations between all the variables assessed and presence
of residual invasive carcinoma. Thus, all of the variables
were included in the multivariate analysis. Multivariate
regression analysis results are shown in Table 4. The analysis was limited to subjects from whom complete data was
available (n ¼ 296). Of all the variables analyzed, only
nodal status (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 3.06, P < .0001), TN status (OR ¼ 3.28, P ¼ .02), and tumor size (OR ¼ 3.49, P
¼ .001) maintained statistical significance on multivariate
analysis. After nodal status, TN status, and tumor size were
entered into the model, no additional variables met the
0.05 significance level for entry into the model.
DISCUSSION
The TN phenotype is a putative surrogate for the basallike subtype that is characterized by a gene expression profile similar to that of the basal-myoepithelial layer of normal breast.1 Although they are not synonymous terms,
there is substantial overlap between TNBC and basal-like
breast cancer; approximately 80% of TNBCs are also basal-like breast cancers, and 80% of basal-like breast cancers express the TN phenotype.19,20 TN phenotype
represents a heterogeneous collection of tumors that
account for approximately 15% of breast cancers in the
United States. TNBC disproportionately affects young

TNBC also tends to have aggressive features such as high
nuclear grade and high mitotic index. Paradoxically,
TNBC is not consistently associated with higher regional
lymph node involvement. Some recent analyses have suggested that TNBC has a decreased prevalence of lymph
node metastasis and exhibits dissociation between tumor
size and positive lymph nodes.11,25,26 In addition to
higher LRR rates, TNBCs have a higher rate of distant
metastases and are more likely to metastasize to visceral
organs.27 Although relatively responsive to cytotoxic
chemotherapy, overall, these patients have poorer overall
survival.28 The aggressive biologic nature of these tumors
in combination with lack of targeted systemic therapy
makes TNBC a therapeutic challenge for oncologists.
In recent decades, the risk of residual disease after
local breast tumor excision has been examined in multiple
studies. For example, in 1997, Wazer et al reported a positive reexcision rate (including invasive and intraductal carcinoma) of 49%.16 In the present analysis, the positive
reexcision rate (including invasive and intraductal carcinoma) is 44%. Thus, despite advances in imaging, localization, and pathologic margin assessment, little progress
has been made toward the preoperative identification of
patients who are at high risk for residual disease. Our
results suggest that factoring molecular phenotype into
the decision-making regarding the need for reexcision
may be useful.
Although our positive reexcision rates are similar to
those of previously published reports, our findings differ.
This study identified nodal status, TN status, and tumor
size as independent predictors of residual invasive carcinoma. This is contrary to prior reexcision studies that

showed margin status, EIC, and age to be major predictors of residual disease.16-18 However, our study was
designed differently than the prior reexcision studies,
because we deliberately excluded patients with residual
DCIS from the analysis whereas residual DCIS was
included in the prior studies as a positive outcome. We
made the decision to exclude residual DCIS, because preliminary analysis of our data with the inclusion of residual
DCIS as a positive outcome showed that molecular phenotype was not statistically significantly correlated with
residual disease. When we excluded the patients with
residual DCIS, a strong correlation between molecular
phenotype and residual invasive carcinoma emerged. By
excluding residual DCIS, we effectively obviated the predictive role of EIC.
Although age >45 years (OR ¼ 0.45, P ¼ .003) was
significantly associated with residual invasive disease on
univariate analysis, it did not enter into the forward stepwise multivariate model. The lack of independent predictive value of age is likely related to redundancy between
TN status and young age. To further clarify the relationship between age and TN status, we also ran a multivariate
analysis with age included in the multivariate model, and
TN status still maintained statistical significance. Thus,
the influence of TN status is maintained even independent of age, but not vice versa. Similarly, positive margin
status (OR ¼ 1.76, P ¼ .01) was significantly correlated
with residual invasive carcinoma on univariate analysis
but did not enter into the multivariate model. One explanation for why margin status is not an independent predictor of residual disease in our study may be reflective of
more meticulous pathologic margin assessment in the relatively recent study period. Also, margin status in our
study was defined with respect to invasive carcinoma,
whereas the prior studies analyzed margin status with
respect to intraductal and invasive carcinoma.
Although the Her2-enriched phenotype is associated
with an increased risk of LR,7 in this study it was not
found to have a statistically significant correlation with
the risk of residual disease (31% compared to 30% in
luminal A and B). This may be related to the very small
sample size of only 16 cases with the Her2-enriched

phenotype. Alternatively, this could reflect selection bias,
because the majority of high-risk Her2-enriched patients
may have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or mastectomy and thus would not have been included in our
study.
This study is a retrospective pathologic chart review
of reexcision data with inherent limitations. As with all
retrospective data, selection bias is possible, because some
patients with more aggressive tumors may have had upfront mastectomy and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
thus been excluded from this study. However, the proportion of each molecular phenotype in this study was consistent with national data on the incidence of each
molecular phenotype and does not suggest an overt selection bias with regard to molecular phenoptype. The decision to reexcise was also subjective, because there was no
predefined institutional policy. Rather, all cases were presented to the respective institution’s prospective multidisciplinary tumor board, and recommendations were made
after careful review of the clinical scenario, pathology,
margin, and description of surgical procedure performed.
Extensively positive margins were generally recommended
for reexcision, and recommendations for close or focally
positive margins were made on a case-by-case basis and
largely reflect individual surgeon preferences. Although
there are inherent limitations to this approach, the results
are meant to help illuminate factors that should be considered when contemplating the need for reexcision. The
increased risk of residual disease burden in TNBC is
meant to be hypothesis-generating and provides incremental progress in understanding the mechanism as to
why TNBCs have higher rates of local recurrence, and
help to direct treatment accordingly.
Conclusions

Our study shows that TN phenotype is independently
correlated with increased risk of residual disease after lumpectomy. This finding suggests that TNBCs harbor more
microscopic residual disease after lumpectomy, and thus
molecular phenotype should factor into decision-making
regarding the extent of initial surgery (generous gross margins) and the need for reexcision. TNBCs may also benefit
from dose escalation to the tumor bed region. The
EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) boost versus no boost trial revealed a statistically significant local control benefit for boost in all age
groups, with the largest benefit seen in the younger
patients.29 A subgroup analysis of this trial revealed that
the largest proportional benefit of boost was in high-grade
tumors and in patients under the age of 50 years.30
Cancer

August 15, 2012

Because TNBCs occur more frequently in young patients
and are overwhelmingly high-grade, one may extrapolate
that TNBCs may gain a higher proportional local control
benefit from the administration of boost radiation to the
tumor bed.
