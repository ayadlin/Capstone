ABSTRACT
The p53 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways play crucial roles in human
cancer development. Simultaneous targeting of both pathways is an attractive
therapeutic strategy against cancer. In this study, we report an antitumor molecule
that bears a pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole scaffold and functions as an enantiomeric inhibitor
against both the p53-MDM2 interaction and the NF-κB activation. It is a first-in-class
enantiomeric inhibitor with dual efficacy for cancer therapy. Synergistic effect was
observed in vitro and in vivo. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies
further provided insights into the nature of stereoselectivity.

human body [8, 9]. Under basal conditions, the NF-κB
complex responsible for regulating the transcription of
DNA is suppressed by a family of inhibitors called IκBs
in the cytoplasm via protein association. Under stimulated
conditions, the IκB inhibitory proteins are phosphorylated
by IκB kinase (IKK) composed of α, β and γ subunits,
resulting in ubiquitination and eventual degradation of
the IκBs. The dissociated NF-κB complex subsequently
enters the nucleus where it binds to DNA and activates
gene expression. Therefore, inhibition of NF-κB signalling
by preventing the IKK phosphorylation of IκB proteins
has potential therapeutic applications to the treatment of
cancer and inflammatory diseases [10].
Recent analysis showed many NF-κB repressors
may also function as p53 activators and vice versa
[11,  12]. Regulation of the cross-talk between the p53
and the NF-κB pathways would offer a unique therapeutic
opportunity for targeting [11]. However, the promiscuous
interaction of a small molecule with off-target proteins

INTRODUCTION
The p53 tumor suppressor protein is believed to
play a crucial role in preventing cancer development by
regulating cell cycle and inducing apoptosis [1]. MDM2
protein is a negative regulator of the p53 pathway and its
overexpression in cancer cells may lead to inactivation
of p53 cellular function. Disruption of the p53-MDM2
interaction is expected to overcome the oncogenic
consequences of MDM2 overproduction and restores
p53 function [2]. The design and identification of potent
p53-MDM2 inhibitors have been avidly pursued in the
past decade and several non-peptide small inhibitors such
as nutlins [3], benzodiazepines [4], spirooxindoles [5],
and piperidinones [6] have been developed as anticancer
agents.
The NF-κB is another central mediator of cellular
response to external stimuli [7] involved in the control
of inflammation, apoptosis and cell proliferation in the

frequently causes toxicity [13] and adverse effects
[14, 15]. Conversely, a single drug target can be
therapeutically insufficient, particularly in complex
neuropsychiatric conditions, cancers and infectious
diseases [16]. Designing compounds with a specific
multi-target profile is both complex and challenging
[17, 18]. The problem of designing molecules against a
multi-target profile involves the parallel optimization of
multiple structure-activity relationships within a desired
range of physicochemical properties [19].
In our recent study [20], a distinct effort was made
to design a p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors bearing
pyrrolidone system through structure-based virtual
screening. Subsequently, a novel pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole
was rationally designed as a potent inhibitor of the p53MDM2 protein-protein interaction and the NF-κB pathway.
A dual inhibitor is preferred over the combined use of two
single-target p53-MDM2 and NF-κB inhibitors because it
eliminates the need to optimize individual inhibitor doses
for efficacy and the potential complications of drug-drug
interactions. In this study, racemic pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole
was demonstrated as a first-in-class small molecule
being used simultaneously as a p53-MDM2 and NF-κB
inhibitor. The p53-MDM2 inhibition was confirmed by
cell-free biochemical assay and cell-based Western blot.
Meanwhile, the racemic compound was also shown to
suppress NF-κB nuclear translocation by inhibiting the IκB
kinases of NF-κB pathway [21].
The central goal of this study is to determine
whether the two enantiomers (see Supplementary
information for NMR spectra and chiral separation,
Figure S1) of the newly designed racemic compound [21]
of 5-(3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)propyl)-4-(4-bromo-phenyl)1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-3-phenyl-4,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]
pyrazol-6(1H)-one (Figure 1), could respectively target
these two different pathways with promising selectivity.
This hypothesis was supported by a series of biological
assays and computational studies.

To quantify the level of p53-MDM2 inhibition by
the enantiomers of compound 5s, Western blot analysis
was carried out to analyze p53 and MDM2 protein levels
in A549 cells. Interestingly, compound R-5s increased
the p53 protein level in a dose-dependent manner and
inhibited MDM2 expression after 4h treatment (Figure 2),
while no significant change was observed in compound
S-5s treated cells. In MCF-7 cells, similar results were
observed for p53, while no significant change was
observed for MDMX, a homolog oncoprotein of MDM2
(Figure 3). These findings were consistent with the
biochemical assay of MDMX (Ki> 100 μM, data not
shown).
To determine differences in their bioactivity on the
NF-κB pathway, the relative cytoplasmic levels of IκBα
and IKKs from the same cell lysates were examined
by Western blot assay (Figure 2). Contrary to the p53
pathway, both enantiomers inhibited phosphorylated
IκBα. Compound S-5s exhibited both higher activity and
concentration-dependency as compared with R-5s. For
IκB kinases, incubation of the cells with compound S-5s
only for 4h markedly activated the phosphorylation of
IKKβ only or both IKKβ and IKKα and phosphorylated
IKKγ in a dose-dependent manner, with no obvious
changes in total IKK proteins. Similar behaviour for IκBα
with no differences was observed when treated with the
other enantiomer, indicating that the compound S-5s of
pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole compound suppressed NF-κB
activation through inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation
mediated by the IKKs phosphorylation. The similar
but much weaker effect of the other R-5s was probably
induced by the p53 pathway rather than by direct
inhibition of the NF-κB pathway.
The in vitro antiproliferative activity shown in
Table 1 demonstrated that the two enantiomers had a
distinct synergistic effect against various cell types.

The IC50 values of the two enantiomers were 27.4 and
21.2 μM against A549 cells, respectively, while the
racemic exhibited a non-additive synergistic enhancement
of 5.82 μM. The similar effect was observed in both
H1299 and U2 OS cells, but not obviously in Saos-2 cells.
Western blot study showed that the S-5s could inhibit
NF-κB activation only, while the R-5s could inhibit both
p53-MDM2 interaction and induce the inhibition of
NF-κB activation with the in vitro antiproliferative result
indicating poor selectivity over cancer cell lines (H1299
and Saos-2) with deleted p53.
Considering that both the p53 and NF-κB were
involved in the control of apoptosis [1, 22], the effect
of the two enantiomers on the induction of A549 cell
apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (Figure 4). After 47 h treatment at the concentration
of 10 μM, the percentage of apoptotic cells for the two
enantiomers was about 4.18% and 2.92%, respectively,
while no significant apoptotic effect was demonstrated in
the control group.
To investigate the in vivo effect of the two
enantiomers on tumor growtha, an A549 xenograft mouse
model was prepared to evaluate compound 5s racemic
at the dose of 200 mg/kg, while the dose of 100 mg/kg
was used for the two single enantiomers. As depicted
in Figure  5, intragastrical (i.g.) administration of these
compounds for 18 days significantly inhibited tumor
growth (p < 0.05). The tumor volume was inhibited by
40.53% (racemic), 32.35% (S-5s) and 24.11% (R-5s),
respectively. The two enantiomers were found to be well
tolerated during the test and showed no significant loss
of body weight as compared with the reference drug
doxorubicin (DOX) (Figure 5). The above results also
indicate that the two enantiomers had some synergistic
effect both in vitro and in vivo.
Docking studies were performed to examine
the potential mode of binding for R-5s and S-5s in
MDM2 (Figure 6). The result showed both enantiomers

bind similarly to the crystallographically observed
benzodiazepine, indicating that insertion of its aromatic
substituents into the three primary sub-pockets of MDM2
was crucial for molecular recognition. The interactions
involved were the two phenyl rings with the two
hydrophobic I61 and V93 sub-pockets and the diazole
ring binding to the H96 sub-pocket via π-π interaction.
The primary scaffold of the pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole
group in S-5s occupied the same L54 and G58 region
as benzodiazepine with a single hydrogen bond formed
between its lactam oxygen atom and L54. This binding
conformation also allowed the benzyl group of R-5s to
bind outside the binding hotspot region of MDM2 and
formed an additional π-π interaction with F55 which
was neither possible in benzodiazepine nor S-5s. The
overall docking score for R-5s and S-5s was -7.6 and
-6.7, respectively vs. -7.6 of benzodiazepine which could
corroborate our observed higher bioactivity of R-5s over
S-5s against the p53-MDM2 pathway.
For IKKβ, the original solved X-ray structure
consists of XNM (4-((4-(4-(chlorophenyl) ­­pyrimidin-2-yl)
amino) phenyl) (4-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazin-1-yl)
methanone) that binds to a series of connected
hydrophobic  pockets consisting of L21, V29, A42,
I65, Y98, and G102 with hydrogen bonding to K106
(Figure  S2). The observed binding mode for both R-5s
and S-5s showed binding poses that recapitulate the
interactions of XNM by binding to the same sites with
its primary scaffold while extending its halo substituted
phenyl ring into the V29 and I26 sub-pocket, forming a salt
bridge between its negatively charged diazole group with
K105. The difference in the mode of binding between S-5s
and R-5s was the placement of its primary scaffold and the
subsequent placement of all four of its aromatic rings into
various sub-pockets of IKKβ. For S-5s, the placement of
its core scaffold near E149 resulted in a favourable nonbond interaction of nearly -5kcal/mol which was not found
in XNM and R-5s. The overall docking score for R-5s and

S-5s was -4.1 and -5.4, respectively vs. -7.6 of XNM. The
observed docking score was relatively low that suggests
both enantiomers could be a relatively weak inhibitor
as compared to XNM with S-5s as the more potent of
the two for potentiating the synergistic bioactivities of
compound 5s.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were
carried out to further establish the dynamical nature
of the essential interactions involved in molecular
recognition (Figure 8). The 100ns simulations for the
original X-ray structures of MDM2 with benzodiazepine
exhibited an average CαRMSD of 1.0Å with a standard
deviation with 0.1Å, indicating the existence of a
tightly bound complex that did not allow significant
conformational changes after complexation. For IKKβ
with XNM, the average CαRMSD for the ligand binding
IKKβ KD domain was 2.9Å (Figure S3) with a standard
deviation with 0.5Å, indicating a more conformation
flexible target. For the two enantiomeric complexes, the
simulations showed that the predicted modes of binding
were maintained with a relatively slight increase in
average CαRMSD for MDM2 with R-5s and a decrease in
average CαRMSD for IKKβ with S-5s at 1.5Å and 2.4Å,
respectively. The ability to lower the conformational

flexibility of IKKβ KD domain suggested the potentiality
of S-5s as an allosteric protein-protein interaction
inhibitor (PPIi) for modulating IKKβ’s affinity for the
NF-κB complex.
Finally, the average nearest interatomic distances
between the inhibitors and the essential residues with
the ligand binding site identified from the docking study
are shown in Table 2. For MDM2, all but two of the
distances between MDM2 and either benzodiazepine or
R-5s were conserved with less than 1.0Å differences.
R-5s with an additional methylene spacer between
its core scaffold and the diazole group allowed it to
penetrate deeper into the His96 sub-pocket as compared
with benzodiazepine. Also as shown in the docking
study and the per energy interaction diagram, R-5s could
extend its benzyl group to Phe55 to form an additional
π-π interaction with an average nearest interatomic
distance of 4.6Å. For IKKβ, similar conserved distances
were observed including K106 with the exception of
E149. The placement of S-5s core scaffold near E149
at the average nearest interatomic distance of 3.4Å
explained why the observed favourable non-bond
interaction of -5kcal/mol was distinctively unique from
R-5s and XNM (Figure S4).

DISCUSSION

For the two enantiomers of compound 5s obtained by
chiral separation, we found only R-5s could inhibit p53MDM2 interaction and release p53 to suppress tumor
proliferation. Molecular modelling further corroborates
with our biochemical studies. Like most p53-MDM2
inhibitors, R-5s could mimic the three residues of the p53

In the present study, we reported a first-in-class
enantiomeric inhibitor with dual efficacy for cancer
therapy. Our previous report demonstrated the chiral center
played a crucial role in the MDM2 binding activity [21].

and insert into three sub-pockets of MDM2 with a much
higher docking Gscore of -7.652 (Figure 6B). However,
S-5s interacted with MDM2 by only filling its Phe19 and
Trp23 sub-pockets with its two aromatic substituents
(Figure 6C).
Interestingly, the inactive p53-MDM2 inhibitor
S-5s demonstrated promising in vitro antiproliferative
activity as compared with active enantiomer R-5s. On
the other hand, racemic compound 5s was illustrated to
efficiently suppress NF-κB activation by inhibiting NF-κB
protein translocation to the nucleus [21]. In this study, we
demonstrated that S-5s could inhibit IκBα phosphorylation
and markedly activate the phosphorylation of IKKβ only
or both IKKβ and IKKα and phosphorylated IKKγ in
a dose-dependent manner only for 4 h. Therefore, S-5s
could inhibit NF-κB signalling via promoting the IKK
phosphorylation and preventing the phosphorylation of
IκB proteins. In addition, most NF-κB repressors have
been found to be p53 activators and vice versa [11, 12].
The Western blotting resultshowed that R-5s could inhibit
the p53-MDM2 binding in the cells and subsequently
induce the NF-κB inhibition (Figure 2). Computational
study predicted that the S-5s had a better docking Gscore
(-5.441) with IKKβ protein than R-5s (Gscore = -4.143)
(Figure 7).
It was hypothesized that drug combination
acting more than one target could enhance normal
tumor sensitivity and increase therapeutic indices.
However, this hypothesis is being challenged clinically
because it is no easier to achieve a tolerable drug level.
It was found in this study that two enantiomers of one
compound could lower the risk of drug combination
and targets two different pathways simultaneously. It
is also encouraging to see that the two enantiomers had
a synergistic effect in three cell lines except Saos-2.
For the in vivo efficacy, the enantiomers reduced the
tumor volume by 32.35% for S-5s and 24.11% for R-5s
vs. 40.53% for the racemic compound 5s (p < 0.01),
which is not significantly lower than 46.17% for DOX
(p < 0.01). The above result indicated an apparent
synergistic in vivo effect.
In conclusion, we have characterized the mechanism
of action of the two enantiomers of pyrrolo[3,4-c]
pyrazole compound 5s. R-5s was found to be potent
toward MDM2 and might induce NF-κB inhibition.
S-5s could selectively suppress NF-κB activation by
inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation and the cytoplasmic
level elevation of phosphorylated IKKs. The enantiomers
had a synergistic effect both in vitro and in vivo. The
results of computational analysis further corroborate
with the above biological study. The present study
has further demonstrated that MD simulations are a
powerful tool to predict the atomistic behaviour of tightly
binding inhibitors. The obtained interatomic distance

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

measurements indicate that the final binding poses of the
two enantiomers are very stable as compare with initial
molecular docking model. Further structural optimization
to identify the inhibitors of these two pathways with much
higher selectivity is ongoing in our laboratory.

METHODS
In vitro antiproliferative assay
The cellular growth inhibitory activity was
determined using two human osteosarcoma cell lines [U-2
OS and Saos-2] and two human lung cancer cell lines [A549
and NCI-H1299]. An amount of 5-6 × 104 cells per well was
transferred to 96-well plates. After culturing for 24 h, the test
compounds were added to triplicate wells at serial diluted
concentrations and 0.1% DMSO for control. After 72 h
of incubation, 20 μL of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution (5 mg/mL) was
added to each well, and after the sample was shaken for
1 min, the plate was incubated further for 4 h at 37 °C.
The compounds were dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO. The
absorbance (OD) was quantitated with the microplates using
Biotek Synergy H2 at 570 nm. Wells containing no drugs
were used as blanks. The concentration of the compounds
that inhibited cell growth by 50% (IC50) was calculated.
Nutlin-3 was used as a reference compound.

Western blotting assay
A549 or MCF-7 cancer cells with wild-type p53
were grown in the recommended medium supplemented
with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) in a humidified environment
with 5% CO2. After 4 h treatment with various
concentrations of the compounds, cells were lysed and the
protein extract was denatured and run on 5% Trisglycine
polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Gels were electroblotted
onto nitrocellulose membranes, and Western detection was
carried out using 5% milk buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in
TBS/0.1% Tween-20) throughout. Proteins were detected
by ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce, #32209)
using antibodies specific for human p53 (Calbiochem,
#OP43T), MDM2 (Millipore, #07−575), MDMX (abcam,
#ab16058), NF-κB p65 (D14E12) Rabbit mAb (CST,
#8242S), NF-κB (p105/p50) (NFKB1) antibody (Epitomic,

were energy minimized using OPLS-AA 2005 force field
[26] to optimize all hydrogen-bonding networks. Both
enantiomers of compound 5s were built and docked into
the prepared protein structure without restraints using the
Standard Precision protocol of Schrodinger’s Glide v5.6. To
identify the key amino residues involved in the molecular
recognition that distinguish between the two enantiomers,
the non-bond per residue interaction energies between each
docked ligand to residues within 12Å of the targeted binding
site were evaluated with a constant dielectric constant of 4.

A549 cells (5 × 105 cells/mL) were seeded in
six-well plates and treated with the compounds at the
concentration of 10 μM for 47 h. The cells were then
harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with cold
PBS. After centrifugation and removal of the supernatants,
cells were resuspended in 400 μL 1X binding buffer, which
was then added to 5 μL annexin V-FITC and incubated
at room temperature for 15 min. After addition of 10 μL
of PI, the cells were incubated at room temperature
for another 15 min in the dark. The stained cells were
analyzed with a flow cytometer (BD Accuri C6).

Molecular dynamics simulation
MD simulations were carried out for MDM2 and
IKKβ in complex with the structurally solved inhibitors
and with the more potent of the two enantiomers. Each
system was solvated in a cubic box with explicit TIP3P
water [27] and counter ions consisting of a 10Å solvent
buffer region from the edge of the complex. The long
range electrostatic interactions were evaluated by
the Particle-Mesh Ewald method under the periodic
boundary condition. 100 ns simulation was carried out
for each docked model using DESMOND [28] with
OPLS-AA 2005 force field under the isobaric isothermal
(NPT) condition at 300K and 1 atm. The stability of the
simulation was assessed by monitoring the CαRMSD with
respect to the minimized starting structure. For IKKβ
consisting of KD, ULD and SDD domains, the CαRMSD
was evaluated for the ligand binding KD domain.

In vivo antitumor study
The in vivo antitumor activity of 5s and its
enantiomers was evaluated using DOX as the reference
drug. BALB/C nude male mice (Certificate SCXK20030003, weighing 18−20 g) were obtained from Shanghai
Experimental Animal Center of Chinese Academy of
Sciences. A549 cancer cell suspension was implanted
subcutaneously into the right axilla region of the mice.
Treatment was initiated when the implanted tumor grew to
a volume of about 120 mm3 in after 13 days. The animals
were randomized into appropriate groups (6 animals per
treatment group and 10 animals for the control group) and
administered by gavage once daily for 18 consecutive days
from day 13 after implantation of the cells. Tumor volumes
(TV) were monitored by caliper measurement of the length
and width and then calculated using the formula: TV = 1/2 ×
a × b2, where a is the tumor length and b is the width. Tumor
volumes and bodyweights were monitored every 4 days
throughout the course of treatment. Mice were sacrificed
on day 33 after cell implantation, and tumors were removed
and recorded for analysis. Tumor volume inhibition was

Molecular docking

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The standard protocol for the docking study used
for distinguishing the different potential mode of binding
among enantiomers has been described in detailed
elsewhere [23]. Briefly, All docking studies were carried
out using the Schrodinger modeling suite package [24].
The crystallographic structures of the targeted MDM2
(PDB code: 1T4E) [4] and IKKβ (PDB code: 3RZF)
[25] with bound inhibitors were used as the starting
point for examining the potential mode of binding for the
two enantiomers of compound 5s. All crystallographic
waters and ions were removed prior to the addition of
the missing hydrogen atoms according to the ionizable
states at physiological pH. The prepared protein structures
