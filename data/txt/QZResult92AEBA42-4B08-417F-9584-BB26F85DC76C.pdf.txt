ABSTRACT
miR-124 and miR-506 are reportedly down-regulated and associated with tumor
progression in many cancers, but little is known about their intrinsic regulatory
mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we found that the miR-124
and miR-506 levels were significantly lower in human CRC tissues than in controls, as
indicated by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization histochemistry. We also found that the
overexpression of miR-124 or miR-506 inhibited tumor cell progression and increased
sensitivity to chemotherapy in vitro. Increased miR-124 or miR-506 expression also
inhibited tumor cell proliferation and invasion in vivo. Luciferase reporter assays and
western blotting were used to determine the association between miR-124, miR-506
and their target genes, DNMTs. We further identified that miR-124 and miR-506
directly targeted DNMT3B and indirectly targeted DNMT1. The overexpression of
miR-124 and miR-506 reduced global DNA methylation and restored the expression of
E-cadherin, MGMT and P16. In conclusion, our data showed that miR-124 and miR-506
inhibit progression and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy by targeting DNMT3B
and DNMT1 in CRC. These findings may provide novel avenues for the development
of targeted therapies.

that involves multiple molecules and pathways. The
classic adenoma-carcinoma model of CRC is initiated
by the progressive accumulation of genetic alterations,
which subsequently result in the malignant transformation
of normal colorectal epithelial cells into adenocarcinoma
cells [6]. Nevertheless, further research is required to
identify the underlying mechanisms involved in the
development and progression of CRC.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding
RNAs that usually negatively regulate gene expression
by degrading target mRNAs, inhibiting the translation
of these mRNAs, or both [7]. Many studies have
demonstrated that miRNAs can function as oncogenes or
tumor suppressors and are often dysregulated in tumors

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause
of cancer death worldwide, and the morbidity rate of CRC
positively correlates with age [1]. The incidence of CRC
continues to increase and ranks fifth among malignant
tumor-related deaths in China [2]. Although surgery,
chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the treatment of CRC
have substantially improved in recent decades, the overall
survival rate and 5-year survival rate of patients remain
poor [3]. Invasion or metastasis to distant organs, such
as the lung and liver, is common and is the main cause
of death in patients with CRC [4, 5]. The initiation and
progression of CRC are governed by a complex network

[8]. miRNAs play a vital role in many crucial cellular
processes, including apoptosis, differentiation, invasion
and proliferation [9–11]. The abnormal expression of
miRNA has been reported in many cancers, including
breast cancer [12], gastric cancer [13], colorectal cancer
[14], liver cancer [15], leukemia [16], and lymphoma [17].
miR-124 and miR-506 have also been reported to
function as important regulators in many human cancers
[18–20]. Specifically, both miR-124 [21] and miR-506
[22] are reportedly involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), which is considered to influence and
promote certain cell motility and metastasis steps during
tumor progression [23, 24]. However, the pathological
correlations and biological functions of miR-124 and miR506 in the control of colorectal tumourigenesis have not
been characterized.
DNA methylation is a postreplicative modification
that usually occurs in prokaryotic and eukaryotic
genomes. It has been reported to be involved in a variety
of vital biological functions, such as the regulation of
gene expression, inactivation of the X-chromosome,
and preservation of chromosomal integrity [25–28].
DNA methylation is the enzymatic addition of a methyl
group to the carbon at the 5 position of cytosine in the
context of the sequence 5′-cytosine-guanosine (CpG),
and this process is mediated by DNA methyltransferases
(DNMTs: DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT1) [29, 30].
The promoter regions of approximately 50% of human
genes contain DNA regions with greater cytosine and
guanine contents than expected. The hypermethylation
of these regions mediates gene transcriptional silencing
[30, 31]. The silencing of structurally normal tumor
suppressor genes by aberrant DNA hypermethylation
has been reported in cancer therapy, such as those used
to treat gastric cancer [32]. Furthermore, the association
of miRNAs with DNA methylation has been reported
in many human cancers. Specifically, miR-152 inhibits
liver fibrosis by attenuating DNMT1-mediated Patched1
methylation [33]. Hepatocarcinogenesis is also reportedly
regulated by DNA methylation via microRNAs [34].
miR-124 has also been reported to target SP1, which is
associated with DNA methylation [35].
An increasing number of studies have revealed that
global DNA hypomethylation and regional hypermethyl­
ation frequently occurs during tumorigenesis [36–38],
which indicates that aberrant methylation substantially
contributes to cancer initiation or progression.
In this study, we found that miR-124 and miR506 were strongly down-regulated in CRC tissues and
cell lines. Functional studies identified miR-124 and
miR-506 acted as new tumor suppressors in CRC.
Moreover, we found that miR-124 and miR-506 targeted
DNMT3B and DNMT1 (SP1 is a transactivator of the
DNMT1 gene), which markedly reduced the expression
of DNMT3B, DNMT1 and SP1 at both the RNA and
protein levels. In turn, this reduced expression led
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to a decrease in global DNA methylation and the reexpression of the tumor suppressor genes E-cadherin,
MGMT (O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase)
and P16 via promoter DNA hypomethylation.

RESULTS
miR-124 and miR-506 are downregulated
in colorectal cancer
The expression levels of miR-124 and miR-506
were detected by qRT-PCR in 40 pairs of CRC tissues
and their matched adjacent tissues, as well as in CRC
cell lines. Among samples from 40 patients with CRC,
approximately 82.5% (P = 0.000, 33 of 40 patients) and
75% (p = 0.000, 30 of 40 patients) of tumor tissues revealed
notable reductions in the miR-124 and miR-506 levels,
respectively (Figure 1A). The miR-124 and miR-506
expression levels in eight CRC cell lines were measured
by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the expression
levels of miR-124 and miR-506 were significantly lower
in SW620 and SW480 cells than in NCM460 normal
colonic epithelium cells (Figure 1B). Therefore, we overexpressed miR-124 and miR-506 in SW620 and SW480
cells to evaluate the possible role of miR-124 and miR-506
in CRC pathogenesis. To further verify the biological roles
of miR-124 and miR-506 in human CRC, we performed
in situ hybridization (Figure 1C) to evaluate the miR-124
and miR-506 levels in 40 CRC tissues and 40 normal
colon tissues and found that miR-124 and miR-506 were
strongly downregulated in CRC tissues compared with
normal tissues. Among samples from 40 patients with
CRC, approximately 65% (P = 0.000, 26 of 40 patients)
and 70% (P = 0.000, 28 of 40 patients) of tumors revealed
notable reductions in the miR-124 and miR-506 levels,
respectively. These data indicate an overt downregulation
of miR-124 and miR-506 in CRC.

Overexpression of miR-124 or miR-506 inhibits
tumor cell progression and increases sensitivity
to chemotherapy in vitro
The ectopic expression of miR-124 or miR-506 has
been reported to be associated with the progression in
many tumors [18–24]. To assess the biological effects of
overexpressing miR-124 or miR-506 in CRC cells, miR124 or miR-506 mimic was transfected into SW620 and
SW480 cells. The transfections of miR-506 and miR-124
were successful (Supplement Figure S1). Compared with
the scrambled control transfection, the overexpression
of either miR-124 or miR-506 significantly attenuated
the proliferation of the two cell lines (Figure 2A).
Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-124 or miR-506
markedly inhibited the ability of SW620 cells to migrate
(Figure 2B), and the overexpression of either miR-124 or
miR-506 remarkably attenuated cell invasion in SW620

cells (Figure 2C, five fields were counted in the Matrigelcoated cell invasion experiments). Cisplatin (CDDP) and
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are usually used to treat CRC [39];
thus, we measured cell viability to assess the response to
these agents. Specifically, we measured the IC50 values
using MTT assays. The IC50 values of CDDP and 5-FU
in SW480 cells were 2 × 10−7 μg/mL and 32 μg/mL,
respectively. We found that the overexpression of miR124 or miR-506 increased the sensitivity of CRC cells to
these two agents (Figure 2D). The effects of miR-124 and
miR-506 inhibitors on tumor cell proliferation were also
tested. We found that miR-124 and miR-506 inhibitors
decreased the sensitivity of CRC cells to these two agents
(Supplementary Figure S1 and S2).

The above results prompted us to verify that miR124 or miR-506 inhibit CRC tumor cell proliferation
and invasion in vivo. To this end, a xenograft model of
CRC cells in nude mice was constructed. SW620 cells
infected with miR-124, miR-506 or scrambled control
were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of nude mice
(five in each group). The tumor volume was measured
every four days after injection. The growth curves
of the tumors were plotted accordingly the recorded
data. After 28 days, all mice were euthanized to excise

(Figure 3A, 3B). Necropsies were performed, and the
number of metastatic nodules in each mouse was counted

miR-124 and miR-506 directly target DNMT3B
and indirectly target DNMT1

mimics into SW620 cells markedly decreased the protein
levels of DNMT3B and SP1 (Figure 4C). In contrast
to DNMT3B and SP1, miR-124 and miR-506 are not
predicted to hybridize with the DNMT1 3′UTR region.
However, transfecting miR-124 and miR-506 into SW620
cells also generated a marked decrease in DNMT1 protein
levels (Figure 4C). The above results may preliminarily
indicate that DNMT3B is a direct target and that DNMT1
is an indirect target of miR-124 and miR-506. SP1 is a
zinc finger transcription factor that directly binds to the
promoter of DNMT1. SP1 has been reported to positively
regulate the transcription of DNMT1 in mice [42]. We
further confirmed the link between DNMT1 and SP1 by
showing that SP1-siRNA and the overexpression of SP1
in SW620 cells resulted in the downregulation of SP1 and
the subsequent downregulation of the DNMT1 mRNA
levels, as measured by qRT-PCR (Figure 4D).

To understand the mechanism by which miR-124
and miR-506 suppress CRC growth and invasion, we
used two algorithms (Targetscan and Miranda) to help
identify miR-124 and miR-506 targets in CRC. Both
algorithms predicted DNMT3B and SP1 as target genes
(Figure 4A). SP1 has been reported to regulate the
transcription and expression of DNMT1 and is associated
with the cell cycle, proliferation and invasion [40, 41].
We hypothesized that miR-124 and miR-506 may directly
target DNMT3B and may indirectly target DNMT1. We
confirmed this hypothesis in CRC cells by performing
luciferase reporter assays. The DNMT3B, SP1 and
DNMT1 complementary sites were cloned downstream
of the firefly luciferase gene and cotransfected with miR124 mimic, miR-506 mimic or scrambled oligonucleotide.
The luciferase activity was then measured 48 h after
transfection. Transfection with miR-124 and miR-506,
compared with the scrambled oligonucleotide, distinctly
reduced the luciferase activity in SW620 cells that were
co-transfected with either DNMT3B or SP1 but not
DNMT1 reporter constructs (Figure 4B). Moreover,
mutating the putative miR-124 and miR-506 sites in the
3′-UTR of DNMT3B and SP1 abrogated the luciferase
responsiveness to miR-124 and miR-506 (Figure 4B). We
also found that transfecting the miR-124 and miR-506

measured global DNA methylation (GDM) in SW480
and SW620 cells by HPLC-DAD [43] 48 hours after

and the scrambled control. A significant reduction

was observed in the GDM when SW480 and SW620
cells were treated with miR-124 and miR-506 mimics
compared with the controls (Figure 5A). To assess
whether overexpression of miR-124 or miR-506 leads to
the re-expression of hypermethylated and silenced genes
in CRC, we measured the mRNA and protein levels of
E-cadherin, MGMT and P16 in SW480 and SW420 cells
by qRT-PCR and western blotting after transfection with
miR-124, miR-506 or scrambled control. Specifically,
the E-cadherin, MGMT and P16 mRNA levels were
increased compared with the control (Figure 5B), and

these changes persisted at the protein level (Figure 5C).

miR-506 inhibit progression by targeting DNMT3B and
DNMT1 in CRC is shown in Figure 6.

DISCUSSION
Several reports have indicated that either miR124 or miR-506 plays a significant role in growth,
metastasis and proliferation [18–20]. Specifically, miR124 expression is reportedly downregulated in the cells

histochemistry (ISH). These results suggested that the
abnormal expression of miR-124 and miR-506 are
associated with CRC.
Furthermore, we studied the biological effects of
the overexpression of miR-124 and miR-506 in CRC.
The in vitro data demonstrated that miR-124 and miR-506
function as tumor suppressors in CRC. Specifically,

and tissues of esophageal cancer [44] breast cancer [45]
and renal cell carcinoma [46]. Furthermore, miR-506
expression is reportedly downregulated in oral squamous
cell carcinoma [47], nasopharyngeal carcinoma [48] and
gastric cancer [49]. However, miR-124 and miR-506
have rarely been studied in the context of CRC. In this
study, we showed that the miR-124 and miR-506 levels
were significantly lower in CRC tissues than in normal

miR-506 expression in CRC inhibits tumor progression in
vitro and in vivo.
Moreover, the roles of miR-124 and miR-506
in the regulation of DNA methylation in CRC were
characterized. Our data showed that miR-124 and miR506 target DNMTs (DNMT3B and DNMT1), thus leading
to global DNA hypomethylation in CRC. SP1 regulates
a large number of genes associated with the cell cycle,
proliferation and invasion [40, 41]. SP1 can bind to the
promoter of DNMT1 and transactivate the DNMT1 gene

the overexpression of miR-124 and miR-506 inhibits
colorectal tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion
while also increasing drug sensitivity in vitro. These
findings corroborate results from many previous studies.
For example, miR-124 has been shown to inhibit cell
proliferation and suppress tumor growth in breast cancer
[50], and miR-506 has been shown to tumor proliferation
and invasion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [47]. This
inhibition was also verified in a xenograft model of CRC
in nude mice in vivo. Therefore, restoring miR-124 and

miR-506 directly down-regulate DNMT3B and indirectly
down-regulate DNMT1 by targeting SP1; that is, miR124 and miR-506 directly target DNMT3B and indirectly
target DNMT1.
The down-regulation of DNMT3B and DNMT1
by miR-124 and miR-506 has important functional
ramifications. Selective genetic disruption of DNMT3B
has been shown to reduce GDM by only 3%, but the
genetic disruption of both DNMT1 and DNMT3B has
been shown to reduce GDM by 95% and completely
abrogate DNA methyltransferase activity [30, 51]. Our
study showed that miR-124 and miR-506 efficiently
modulate DNA hypomethylation by targeting DNMT3B
and DNMT1. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-124
or miR-506 results in global DNA hypomethylation and
gene re-expression of the hypermethylated and silenced
E-cadherin, MGMT and P16 genes in CRC.
In conclusion, miR-124 and miR-506 may be valuable
markers of CRC prognosis and may play an important role
in the development and progression of human CRC.

qRT-PCR was performed using iQTM SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad, USA) with 5 ng cDNA and 10 pM
of each primer and detected on an Applied Biosystems
7500 Sequence Detection system. The following cycling
conditions were used: one cycle at 94°C for 5 min;
40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s and 56°C for 30 s. A melting
curve analysis was carried out for each PCR reaction to
confirm the specificity of amplification. The expression of
miRNA was calculated based on the threshold cycle (CT),
and after normalization to level of U6 small nuclear RNA
expression, the relative expression levels were calculated as
follows: 2–[(CT ofmiR-30b)–(CT ofU6)]. The U6 snRNA was
5′-ATTGGAACGATACAGAGAAGATT-3′. qRT-PCR for
the target genes was performed as previously described [52].

ISH analysis

The human CRC cell lines SW480, DLD1, HCT116,
HCT15, KM12 and Ls174t were obtained from the Chinese
Academy Medical Science (Beijing, China) and maintained
at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640
medium (Gibco, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; PAA Laboratories, Austria); SW620 and HT29 cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS.

ISH procedures were carried out as previously
described [13]. Briefly, miR-124 and miR-506 miRCURY
LNA custom detection probes (Exiqon, Denmark) were
used for ISH. Hybridization, washing and scanning were
carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The intensities of miR-124 and miR-506 staining
were scored on a scale from 0 to 4 as follows: 0–1 (no
staining), 1–2 (weak staining), 2–3 (medium staining),
and 3–4 (strong staining). The percentages of miR-124
and miR-506 cells in 3 representative high-power fields
of individual samples were analyzed. The expression
scores were determined by multiplying the scores of the
intensities by the percentages of positive cells and ranged
from a maximum of 4 to a minimum of 0. Individual
samples were evaluated by at least 2 pathologists in a
blinded manner, and expression scores greater or equal to
2 were defined as high expression, whereas scores lower
than 2 were indicative of low expression.

Clinical samples

Plasmids and transfection

Prior approval was obtained from The Institutional
Review Board of Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South
University (Changsha, Hunan, China) for the collection
and use of clinical materials for research purposes. All
tissue samples used in this study were collected from
the Third Xiangya Hospital (Changsha, Hunan, China).
Written informed consent was obtained from all study
participants. Forty CRC tissues and the matched adjacent
normal tissues were obtained between 2012 and 2013.
All tissue biopsies used here were freshly frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at –80°C until further use.

To generate the miR-124 and miR-506 expression
vectors, a genomic fragment covering the region encoding
pri-miR-124 or pri-miR-506 and its up-and downstream
region were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pLvthm
vector (Addgene Inc, USA). The vectors were generated by
PCR amplification and subcloned into the Bam HI/Sal I sites
of the pGL3–basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega,
USA). miR-124 mimic, miR-506 mimic and scrambled
oligonucleotides were purchased from Genecopoeia (China)
and transfected into CRC cells using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Two concentrations of miR-124 mimic and
miR-506 mimic (10 and 50 nM) were tested.

SW620 CRC cells using a genomic DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TaKaRa,
Japan). High-performance liquid chromatography/diode
array detectors (HPLC-DAD) were used to determine the
levels of GDM in each sample.

GDM analysis

Protein was extracted from CRC cell lines using
RIPA lysis buffer containing a proteinase inhibitor. The
protein concentration in the lysates was measured with
the Protein BCA Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, USA), and 20 μg of
protein mixed with 2 × SDS loading buffer was loaded in
each lane. The proteins in the lysates were then separated
by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Millipore, USA). To block nonspecific binding,
membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h
in 5% skim milk. Next, the membranes were incubated
for 12 h at 4°C with an antiserum containing antibodies
against DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, SP1, E-cadherin,
MGMT or P16, which were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, USA). A peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) and ECL
western blotting detection reagents were used to visualize
the target proteins (ECL New England Biolabs, USA),
and the resultant signals were quantified with a Bio Image
Intelligent Quantifier 1-D (Version 2.2.1, Nihon-BioImage
Ltd., Japan). An anti-GAPDH antibody (Boster, China)
was used as a protein loading control.

Xenograft model in nude mice
SW620 cells were used to stably over-express
miR-124 and miR-506 using a lentiviral-based system
(pLVTHM) for tumourigenesis assays. Xenograft tumors
were generated via the subcutaneous injection of CRC cells
(2 × 106, SW620/scramble or SW620/miR-506) into the
hind limbs of 4–6 week-old Balb/C athymic nude mice. All
mice were housed and maintained under specific pathogenfree conditions, and all experiments were approved by
the Use Committee for Animal Care and performed in
accordance with institutional guidelines. Tumor size
was measured by a slide caliper, and tumor volume was
determined using the formula: 0.44 × A × B2 (A is the
diameter of the base of the tumor, B is the corresponding
perpendicular value). The tumors were excised after
euthanasia, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and
embedded in paraffin before preparing 4 μm sections,
which were stained with hematoxylin.

Cell proliferation assay
Cells transfected with miR-124 mimic, miR-506
mimic and scrambled oligonucleotides (Ambion, USA) were
plated in 12-well plates at the desired cell concentrations.
Cell counts were estimated by trypsinizing the cells
and counting them in triplicate using a Coulter Counter
(Beckman Coulter, USA) at the indicated time points.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS19.0. The two-tailed paired Student’s t-test was used
to analyze the two groups. The Mann–Whitney U-test and
Spearman’s correlation analyses were used to analyze the
relationship between miR-124 and miR-506 expression
and the clinicopathological features of CRC. Survival
curves were plotted by the Kaplan–Meier method and
compared with the log-rank test. P < 0.05 was considered
to indicate significant differences.

Cell migration assay
Cell migration was examined by wound-healing
assays. An artificial “wound” was created by scratching
a confluent cell monolayer of cells, and the scratched
cells were then treated with 10 mg/mL mitomycin C for
2 hours. Photographs were taken after 24 hours using an
inverted microscope (Olympus, Japan).

described [53]. Cells were seeded onto the basement
membrane matrix present in the insert of a 24-well culture
plate (EC matrix; Chemicon, Japan). After an additional
48 hours, the noninvading cells and EC matrix were gently
