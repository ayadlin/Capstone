ABSTRACT
Targeted delivery of anticancer drugs to tumor cells using monoclonal antibodies
against oncogenic cell surface receptors is an emerging therapeutic strategy. These
strategies include drugs directly conjugated to monoclonal antibodies through chemical
linkers (Antibody-Drug Conjugates, ADCs) or those encapsulated within nanoparticles
that in turn are conjugated to targeting antibodies (Antibody-Nanoparticle
Conjugates, ANPs). The recent FDA approval of the ADC Trastuzumab-TDM1 (Kadcyla®;
Genentech; San Francisco) for the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing metastatic
breast cancer patients has validated the strong potential of these strategies. Even
though the activity of ANPs and ADCs is dependent on lysosomal traffic, the roles
of the endocytic route traversed by the targeted receptor and of cancer cell-specific
alterations in receptor dynamics on the efficiency of drug delivery have not been
considered in these new targeted therapies. For example, constitutive association
with the molecular chaperone HSP90 is thought to either retard ErbB2 endocytosis or
to promote its recycling, traits undesirable for targeted therapy with ANPs and ADCs.
HSP90 inhibitors are known to promote ErbB2 ubiquitination, targeting to lysosome
and degradation. We therefore hypothesized that ErbB2-targeted drug delivery
using Trastuzumab-conjugated nanoparticles could be significantly improved by
HSP90 inhibitor-promoted lysosomal traffic of ErbB2. Studies reported here validate
this hypothesis and demonstrate, both in vitro and in vivo, that HSP90 inhibition
facilitates the intracellular delivery of Trastuzumab-conjugated ANPs carrying a model
chemotherapeutic agent, Doxorubicin, specifically into ErbB2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells, resulting in improved antitumor activity. These novel findings highlight
the need to consider oncogene-specific alterations in receptor traffic in the design
of targeted drug delivery strategies. We suggest that combination of agents that
enhance receptor endocytosis and lysosomal routing can provide a novel strategy to
significantly improve therapy with ANPs and ADCs.

INTRODUCTION

the cell surface [27-31] , which can significantly dampen
the efficacy of ErbB2-targeted drug delivery. Altered
trafficking of ErbB2 is believed to be due in part to its
constitutive association with HSP90 [31-36], which can be
anticipated to dampen the efficacy of ErbB2-targeted drug
delivery. We therefore hypothesized that HSP90 inhibition
will enhance ErbB2-targeted drug delivery by promoting
the endocytic uptake of ErbB2-bound nano-encapsulated
cargo and facilitating its re-routing from a recycling
pathway to the lysosomes. Using Trastuzumab-conjugated
nanogels (Trast-NG) encapsulating the DNA-damaging
drug Doxorubicin (DOX) as a model chemotherapeutic,
we demonstrate through in vitro and in vivo studies that
HSP90 inhibition can indeed lead to an enhancement
of targeted delivery of DOX specifically into ErbB2overexpressing breast cancer cells. As a consequence, a
sub-therapeutic and non-toxic dose of the HSP90 inhibitor
17AAG markedly improves the efficacy of ErbB2-targetd
nanogels in vivo.

Selective overexpression of certain plasma
membrane receptors on cancer cells presents opportunities
for targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents that are either
directly linked to targeting ligands/antibodies or are
encapsulated within nanometer-sized drug delivery
vehicles decorated with targeting ligands/antibodies [1].
Receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and ErbB2 are
overexpressed in many cancers and are being increasingly
targeted with targeted drug delivery modalities, including
Antibody-Drug-Conjugates (ADCs) and nano-particulate
drug delivery systems. Trastuzumab-DM1 (Kadcyla®,
Genentech, San Francisco) is an example of an ADC
developed against ErbB2-overexpressing cancers in which
a cytotoxic drug (Emtansine) is chemically conjugated to
humanized anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab
(Genentech) [2]. Success of drug delivery using ADCs
or ANPs is predictably dependent on robust endocytosis
of the receptor-bound drug and trafficking from early
endosomes to lysosomes, where drug conjugate undergoes
cleavage or nanoparticles optimally release their cytotoxic
drug cargo, followed by drug entry into the cytosol [3-5].
In normal cells, endocytosis and receptor trafficking are
highly regulated processes mediated and regulated by a
plethora of cellular factors. Receptors are endocytosed via
clathrin-dependent or non clathrin-dependent pathways [6,
7]. Following endocytosis, receptors are either routed to the
lysosomes or recycled back to the cell-surface, processes
regulated among other factors by receptor ubiquitination
by E3 ubiquitin ligases (such as Cbl) or de-ubiquitination
by AMSH or USP8 [8-13]. Endosomal Sorting Complex
Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins recognize
ubiquitin-tagged receptor cargo for sorting into inner
vesicles of the multivesicular body for eventual transport
to lysosomes [9, 10, 14, 15]. Various Rab-family GTPases,
functioning at distinct vesicular trafficking steps, also play
critical roles in directing the traffic of endocytosed cargo
towards recycling vs. lysosomal pathways [16, 17]. Cancer
cell-specific alterations (mutations, overexpression) in
receptors themselves or in their traffic regulators can alter
the balance between receptor recycling and lysosomal
trafficking [8, 18]. While the focus of studies to optimize
ANP and ADC design has been on the design of receptortargeted drug delivery systems [19-22], the consequence
of altered recycling vs. lysosomal trafficking behavior
of targeted receptors, and consequently the efficiency of
drug delivery, have received little attention. In this study,
we illustrate the importance of receptor traffic on targeted
drug delivery, using ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumor
targeting through Trastuzumab as a model.
The oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2,
overexpressed in over 20% of breast cancers, has served
as a major target for the development of targeted drug
delivery strategies [23-26]. ErbB2, however, is thought to
be impaired in endocytosis and to rapidly recycle back to

RESULTS
Preparation and characterization of Trast-NG
The core-shell NGs studied here were synthesized
via self-assembly of doubly-hydrophilic poly(ethylene
glycol)-b-poly(methacrylic acid) (PEG-b-PMA) block
copolymers in the presence of a condensing agent (CaCl2),
followed by chemical crosslinking of the poly-ion chains
and removal of the condensing agent, as previously
described [37, 38]. The resulting NGs averaged 110 nm
in diameter and had a net negative charge (ζ-potential =
-22 mV). The core of such (PEG-b-PMA)-based NGs
comprises of a swollen network of cross-linked poly-ion
chains bearing carboxylic groups and is surrounded by a
shell of hydrophilic PEG chains (Figure 1). These NGs
can incorporate very large amounts (~30% by weight) of
water-soluble drugs such as DOX through combination
of electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions [38]. The
NGs were functionalized with streptavidin by inserting an
NH2-PEG-streptavidin linker. Since NGs shell formation
requires ~7.5 kDa PEG chains, we used longer chain PEG
(Mw = 10 kDa) to reduce potential steric interference with
receptor binding by conjugated antibodies. The average
particle size of streptavidin-conjugated NGs was 137 ± 4
nm (polydispersity Index = 0.09, ζ-potential = -19.0 ± 2.3
mV), which is only slightly larger than that of precursor
NGs. Biotinylated Trast or control IgG was then coupled
with streptavidin-modified NGs. The final product was
purified using FPLC; the chromatogram confirmed a very
high yield with little residual free Trast or IgG (Figure S1).
Purified Trast-NGs had an average particle size of 173 ±
3 nm (polydispersity Index = 0.08, ζ-potential = -20.2 ±
3.1 mV), whereas the control IgG-NGs had a size of 177
10523

± 2 nm (polydispersity Index = 0.07, ζ-potential = -19 ±
2.2 mV). After DOX loading, the average particle size of
Trast-NGs decreased to 154 ± 4 nm (polydispersity Index
- 0.19, ζ-potential = -4.1 ± 0.9 mV), whereas the particle
size of IgG-NGs was 157 ± 8 (polydispersity Index = 0.24,
ζ-potential = -2.7 ± 1.3 mV). The reduction in particle size
and net negative charge of NGs after DOX loading are
consistent with neutralization and condensation of PMA
segments by DOX.
Conjugation of Trast to NG did not compromise
its ability to specifically bind to ErbB2 receptors
overexpressed on human breast adenocarcinoma SKBr-3
cells as confirmed by flow cytometry (FACS) (Figure 2A)
and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 2B
and S2). In the latter analyses, two-color imaging showed
complete colocalization of direct ErbB2 staining (stained
in red) with that of bound Trast-NGs (stained in green)
(Figure 2B and S2), demonstrating the ErbB2-specific
binding of Trast-functionalized NGs.
To further explore the specificity of Trast-NGs,
we compared the extent of growth inhibition (MTT dye
incorporation) of ErbB2-overexpressing (BT-474) vs.
ErbB2-low (MCF-7) breast cancer cell lines by DOX
encapsulated within control IgG-NGs vs. Trast-NG (Table
S1). The IC50 value of DOX-loaded Trast-NG (Trast-NG/
DOX) against BT-474 cells was 6-fold lower compared to
that of DOX-loaded NG (NG/DOX), while the two NGs
inhibited MCF-7 cell growth with comparable IC50 values
(Table S1). These experiments confirmed the ability of
Trast-NG to deliver chemotherapeutic payloads to ErbB2overexpressing breast cancer cells with high specificity.

ErbB2 levels decreased by 8h, reflecting the destabilization
due to HSP90 inhibition [31, 32, 39] (Figure 3, last
column). Loss of green Trast signal was concomitant with
loss of ErbB2 (red signal), suggesting that, upon HSP90
inhibition, Trast-NGs follow the endocytic itinerary of
ErbB2 receptor into lysosomes [31-36]. To assess if this
is the case, we examined the colocalization of internalized
Trast-NGs (stained in green) with the lysosomal marker
LAMP-1 (stained in red) in SKBr-3 cells. Confocal
Immunofluorescence analysis (Figure S3) confirmed that
Trast-NGs indeed entered LAMP-1-positive compartments
in the presence of 17AAG. These analyses demonstrate
the strong positive impact of HSP90 inhibition to promote
the internalization and lysosomal targeting of Trast-NG, a
property desirable to facilitate the disintegration of NGs
and release of their encapsulated drugs [3-5].

HSP90 inhibitor-facilitated delivery of DOX into
ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells
Having verified our central hypothesis that
HSP90 inhibition facilitates the routing of Trast-NGs
(without drugs) into lysosomes, we evaluated the ability
of 17-AAG to enhance the lysosomal delivery of NGencapsulated DOX. The ErbB2-overexpressing 21MT-1
cells or the ErbB2-low MCF7 cells (specificity control)
were incubated with increasing concentrations of TrastNG/DOX for 6 h, after which the cells were either left
alone (control) or treated with 100 nM 17-AAG for 18
h to trigger the internalization and lysosomal routing of
targeted NG cargo. Biological effects were assessed by
evaluating DOX-induced G2/M arrest using FACS.
While Trast-NG/DOX treatment of 21-MT1 cells
led to a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells
arrested at the G2M phase, little effect was seen on MCF7
cells, especially at lower concentrations of Trast-NG/DOX
(Figure 4). While inclusion of 17AAG had no impact on
the effect of lower concentrations of Trast-NG/DOX on
MCF7 cells, a statistically significant increase in G2M
cells was noted in 21-MT1 cells treated with identical
concentrations of Trast-NG/DOX (Figure 4). Thus,
inclusion of 17AAG markedly increased the biological
impact of Trast-NG/DOX, relatively selectively against
the ErbB2-overexpressing cell line.

Kinetics of the endocytic uptake of Trast-NG into
ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells
ErbB2 is thought to be impaired for endocytosis or
to primarily recycle [27-31], whereas HSP90 inhibitors
promote ErbB2 entry into lysosomes [31-36]. To assess the
ability of Trast-NGs to access lysosomes by themselves or
in the presence of HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG, we compared
the kinetics of the endocytic uptake of Trast-NG into
ErbB2-overexpressing cell line SKBr-3, using confocal
immunofluorescence analysis. To avoid any impact of
DOX, we used empty Trast-NGs for these analyses. Cells
were either left untreated or treated with 10 µg/mL of free
Trast or Trast-NG (based on protein concentration) for 2,
4 or 8 hours in absence or presence of 17-AAG (100 nM)
followed by confocal imaging (Figure 3). In the absence of
17AAG, Trast-NG (stained in green) was found primarily
at the cell surface throughout the 8h time course, with
relatively little internalization, comparable to that seen
with free Trast (Figure 3, second vs. first column). In
contrast, cells incubated with Trast-NG in the presence
of 17-AAG demonstrated rapid internalization of ErbB2
(stained in red) with notable internal staining at 2 h and
nearly complete intracellular staining at 4h; as expected,

Potentiation of the antitumor efficacy of TrastNG/DOX by 17 AAG in an ErbB2-overexpressing
breast cancer cell line xenograft model in mice
To examine if HSP90 inhibition potentiates the
antitumor efficacy of Trast-NG/DOX in vivo, we treated
mice bearing xenografts of ErbB2-overexpressing BT474 or ErbB2-low MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines with
Trast-NGs/DOX with or without 17AAG. In separate
experiments (with 10 mice/group), we either measured

a negative control, whereas biotinylated Trast served as a positive control. B. Binding of Trast-NG to ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer

changes in tumor volume, or also followed the treated
animals for survival. Control treatments included: 1) 5
% dextrose (negative control); 2) Trast alone (positive
control); 3) IgG-NG/DOX (non-targeted NG) and; 4)
IgG-NG/DOX plus 17-AAG. A total of four treatments
(intravenous injections) were given at 4-day intervals at a
NG dose equivalent to 6 mg of DOX/kg (determined as the
maximum tolerated dose for this treatment schedule) and
3 mg/kg Trast (where applicable). In the cohorts receiving
17-AAG, this drug was administered at 1 mg/kg 2 h after
Trast-NG/DOX or IgG-NG/DOX injection.
The changes in the relative tumor volume for
mice bearing BT-474 (ErbB2-high) tumors are shown in
Figure 5A (data combines results from two independent
experiments). To confirm the in vivo selectivity of the
targeted NG to deliver DOX to ErbB2-overexpressing
tumors, we also evaluated the effect of treatments with
Trast-NG/DOX in comparison to the untargeted IgGNG/DOX, on mice with MCF-7 (ErbB2-low) xenografts
(Figure S4). Student’s t-test was run on the tumor relative
volume change data at day 16, comparing each treatment
groups against 5% Dextrose control. Treatment of mice
carrying BT-474 xenografts with Trast-NG/DOX alone
led to a statistically significant (p < 0.05) tumor growth
inhibition when compared to the control groups (p-value
= 0.0159; data pooled from 2 independent experiments)
(Figure 5A). Sequential Trast-NG/DOX followed by
17AAG treatment led to further enhancement of antitumor activity as compared to Trast-NG/DOX alone group
and markedly increased statistical significance relative to
control group (p = 0.0005). Remarkably, Trast-NG/DOX
+ 17AAG treatment led to an actual reduction in tumor
volume (shrinkage) compared to the pre-treatment tumor
volume, clearly observed at later time points (Figure
5A), although this difference did not reach statistical
significance (p = 0.293).
Compared to results with BT-474 xenografts,
mice bearing MCF-7 xenografts exhibited a small albeit
statistically significant (p = 0.03 vs. control) reduction
in tumor volume upon treatment with Trast-NG/DOX;
however, the difference in tumor volume among groups
treated with IgG-NG/DOX vs. Trast-NG/DOX groups was
not significant (p-value = 0.397) (Figure S4). Comparative
analysis of BT-474 vs. MCF-7 xenografts establishes the
advantage of Trast-based targeting against an ErbB2+
tumor, and clearly demonstrates the enhancement of the
Trast-NG/DOX efficacy by sequential post-treatment with
a small dose (which by itself has no measurable effect on
tumor growth; not shown) of the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG.
Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival data at the end of
the experiment (76 days; censoring date) clearly showed
that BT-474 xenograft tumor-bearing mice treated with
Trast-NG/DOX + 17-AAG had a substantially longer
survival ( > 88%) compared to the Trast-NG/DOX group
(56.8%) (Figure 5B). None of the mice in other treatment
groups (5 % dextrose, Trast alone, IgG-NG/DOX and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

IgG-NG/DOX + 17-AAG) survived until the censoring
date (0% survival) (Figure 5B). The median survival (in
days), the associated Confidence Intervals and the p-values
are shown in Table S2. Overall, our data clearly shows
the superiority of Trast-NG/DOX over untargeted NG/
DOX and suggests that combined treatment with HSP90
inhibitors can vastly improve survival times.
As further evidence of enhanced antitumor activity
of Trast-NG/DOX or Trast-NG/DOX administered
in combination with 17-AAG, we performed IHC
analyses of tumors excised on day 2 after last injection.
Treatment with Trast alone caused a significant reduction
in proliferation (Ki67+ staining; p = 0.0033) but little
increase in apoptosis (caspase-3+ cells) compared to the
control group (5% Dextrose) (Figure 6 and Figure S5),
consistent with a primarily cytostatic effect of Trast [40,
41]. Treatment with untargeted NG (IgG-NG/DOX) also
reduced the percentage of Ki67+ cells (p = 0.0105) but
had little impact on caspase-3+ cells (Figure 6 and Figure
S5), consistent with a cytostatic mechanism of action of
DOX [42, 43]. Notably, Trast-NG/DOX treatment led to
a significant reduction in Ki67+ cells (p = 0.0023) as well
as an increase in the percentage of caspase-3+ cells (p =
0.0059), and combined treatment with 17AAG further
increased the impact of Trast-NG/DOX on both parameters
(p = 0.0011 for Ki67+ cells and p = 0.0012 for caspase-3+
cells) (Figure 6), indicating that the combination is
superior and promotes substantial cytotoxicity as
compared to a primarily cytostatic effect of Doxorubicin
[42, 44]. 17AAG also improved the pro-apoptotic efficacy
of IgG-Trast/DOX but its impact on the anticancer activity
of Trast-NG/DOX was substantially more pronounced,
especially on the percentage of caspase-3+ cells in tumors
(Figure 6 and Figure S5).
To mechanistically link the enhanced anti-tumor
response of Trast-NG/DOX + 17-AAG combination with
the effects of 17-AAG on ErbB2, we performed IHC and
Western blot analyses of ErbB2 levels in tumors of mice
treated with various regimens. Indeed, lower ErbB2 levels
were seen in tumors of Trast-NG/DOX + 17-AAG treated
mice (Figure S7), correlating with the superior antitumor
efficacy of the combination.
Assessment of the impact of various treatment
regimens on body weight indicated that the treatmentrelated toxicities associated with Trast-NG/DOX or TrastNG/DOX + 17-AAG were generally mild ( < 10% loss
of body weight). In contrast, the same dose of DOX or
the free drug combination (DOX + 17-AAG) produced a
considerable body weight loss (18-20%, p < 0.05) (Figure
S6). Light microscopic examination of H&E-stained tissue
sections of liver, lung, kidney, spleen and heart resected
from mice euthanized at the end of the experiment showed
no histopathological changes in Trast-NG/DOX or TrastNG/DOX + 17AAG treatment groups compared to the 5%
Dextrose control group (data not shown), confirming the
relatively low toxicities of Trast-based NGs.

DISCUSSION

lysosomes of breast cancer cells by tampering with the
biological mechanism that retards the delivery of ErbB2
into lysosomes. Our studies demonstrate the feasibility of
this novel approach in achieving superior in vitro targeting
and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in a breast cancer xenograft
model. We suggest that this approach could significantly
potentiate the efficacy of existing ErbB2-targeted nanotherapeutic agents against breast cancer. Furthermore,
adaptation of this approach to facilitate lysosomal
delivery of other receptors on cancer cells currently used
or considered for targeting could substantially improve the
efficacy of targeted cancer nanomedicines in general.
Our choice of ErbB2 receptor for proof-of-principle
studies was based on several key considerations: ErbB2
is the driver oncogene for over 20% of breast cancers
and smaller subsets of many other malignancies [47-49];
ErbB2 is the target of a clinically-approved prototype

Introduction of targeted cancer nanomedicines into
clinical practice has provided substantial momentum for
the development of similar approaches against a variety
of cancers. Most nanoparticle-sized therapeutic agents
require internalization and traffic into acidic endocytic
compartments to ensure the delivery of drug cargo into
appropriate subcellular target [45, 46]. While much
consideration has been given to the polymer design and
the nature of encapsulated drugs to ensure successful
delivery, the importance of the endocytic traffic routes of
cell surface receptors that provide the basis for targeting
of nano-carriers has received little attention. Here, we
develop a proof-of-principle strategy, using ErbB2 as a
targeting receptor, to help facilitate the entry of a model
NG-encapsulated therapeutic agent Doxorubicin into

ADC, Trastuzumab-emtansine conjugate (Kadcyla®,
Genentech) whose conjugated drug must be released
to allow access to its cytosolic target [50]; ErbB2 is
a prototype receptor that is biologically impaired in
lysosomal entry [33, 35, 49]; studies by us and others
have demonstrated that tampering with the function
of a major biological partner of ErbB2 and a key to its
inability to enter lysosomes, the molecular chaperone
HSP90, promotes rapid lysosomal sorting and eventual
degradation of ErbB2 [33, 35, 49]. ErbB2 is constitutively
associated with HSP90, and multiple lines of investigation
have demonstrated that HSP90 function is required for
ErbB2 stability and ErbB2-driven oncogenesis [39, 51,
52]. Availability of specific HSP90 inhibitors has allowed
a dissection of the mechanisms of ErbB2 instability upon
HSP90 inhibition, and have revealed roles for lysosomal
degradation [31-36]. Careful cell biological studies have
revealed the lysosomal targeting of ErbB2 upon HSP90
inhibition to be a relatively early event, and one likely
to be important for the rapid downregulation of ErbB2
from the surface of HSP90 inhibitor-treated cancer cells
[31-36]. In contrast, lysosomal delivery of ErbB2 upon
treatment of ErbB2+ cancer cell lines with Trast is
distinctly slower and incomplete [32, 33], apparently due
to the maintenance of a recycling itinerary of Trast-bound
ErbB2 [53]. Our previous studies demonstrated that low
concentrations of an HSP90 inhibitor, 17AAG, could
however promote Trast-induced lysosomal delivery of
ErbB2 and produce synergistic anti-tumor killing in vitro
[32]. Indeed, Trast + 17AAG exhibit enhanced antitumor
activity in vivo [32]. However, 17AAG and other HSP90
inhibitors have been slower to be adopted clinically as
they produce significant toxicity [54-59]. The focus of
such studies has been on the use of maximally-tolerated
doses of HSP90 inhibitors, even when these are combined
with other therapeutic agents [55-58, 60-64]. Our studies
help establish a new paradigm in which HSP90 inhibitors
at sub-therapeutic, and non-toxic, doses can substantially
improve the efficacy of a nano-formulated therapeutic
agent without significant added toxicity.
Our studies provide support for a potentially novel
use of HSP90 inhibitors to facilitate the endolysosomal
delivery of ADCs or antibody-conjugated drug nanoparticles (ANPs) that rely on targeting of receptors that
are HSP90 clients. A number of such targets have been
identified, including the mutant EGFR in non-small
cell lung cancer [65-68], a receptor we have shown to
constitutively enter the endocytic recycling pathway
[8, 68]. Similarly, glioblastoma-associated EGFR-vIII,
which lacks the normal EGFR’s ability to undergo ligandtriggered lysosomal traffic, is HSP90-associated [69].
Recent studies also suggest that overexpressed EGFR
in gastric cancer cells is efficiently targeted by HSP90
inhibitors for degradation [70]. Thus, our approach using
low doses of an HSP90 inhibitor is likely to be applicable
to other malignancies as ADCs or ANPs against other
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HSP90-dependent receptors are developed for clinical use.
While our studies relied on 17AAG as an HSP90 inhibitor,
a number of other HSP90 inhibitors are being evaluated in
clinical trials, including ones with oral bioavailability [57,
60, 61], and testing of such drugs in the context of ANPs
and ADCs is highly desirable. Since HSP90 inhibition
eventually promotes the degradation of targeted receptors,
such as ErbB2 [32, 39, 71, 72], the scheduling of the ANP
and HSP90 inhibitor is likely to be of key importance.
In our studies, we considered this issue upfront and
demonstrated the ability of HSP90 inhibition to facilitate
the internalization and lysosomal targeting of Trast-NG in
vitro (Figure 3). Accordingly, our preclinical therapy was
designed to administer the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG 2h
hours after injecting nanogels, allowing time for the latter
to reach their target. It remains possible that further studies
to optimize the scheduling of HSP90 inhibitor relative to
ANP will help improve the efficacy of regimens targeting
ErbB2 or other HSP90 client receptors.
Our studies also provide evidence that subtherapeutic doses of an HSP90 inhibitor (1 mg/Kg 17AAG
in our studies, which has little efficacy against BT-474
xenografts; unpublished data), dramatically enhances
tumor killing by DOX-loaded ErbB2-targeted NGs (Figure
5A). Such a combination led to not just inhibition of
xenograft tumor growth but in fact a significant shrinkage
of tumor masses from their pre-treatment volume (Figure
5A). This was associated with a significant shift from a
predominantly cytostatic effect, as expected [42-44], to a
significantly cytotoxic effect on tumors as demonstrated
by Ki67 and caspase-3 staining of tumors among surviving
mice at the end of therapy. Not surprisingly, combination
with low dose 17AAG markedly improved the survival
of tumor-bearing mice (Figure 5B). We must point out
that DOX was used in our proof-of-principle studies as
the polymer design we have previously established allows
efficient loading of this clinically-used chemotherapeutic
agent [37]. However, DOX enhances the cardiotoxicity
associated with ErbB2-targeted antibody therapeutics,
including Trastuzumab [73-75], and as such the approach
will need modifications to incorporate drugs more
appropriate for ErbB2+ cancer therapy. Such studies are
currently ongoing in our laboratories. The current nanocarrier design should however be applicable to other
tumors where a targeting antibody or other moiety is
available.
Based on our studies, we suggest that the endocytic
traffic itinerary of receptors selected for targeting of
ADCs and ANPs should receive careful consideration.
An understanding of mechanisms that may impair the
endolysosomal traffic of a targeted receptor (as with
ErbB2) may help overcome an efficacy barrier for newer
agents in development and potentially improve the efficacy
of agents already in clinic. In this regard, the potential
combination of HSP90 inhibitors that are currently in
clinical trials together with ErbB2-targeted TDM-1 will be
10529

of considerable interest. A recently FDA-approved ADC,
Brentuximab-Vedotin, targets CD30 receptor in Hodgkin’s
lymphomas [76, 77] which requires lysosomal traffic for
its efficacy [5], although the mechanisms of lysosomal
trafficking of CD30-bound ADC remain unknown.
It is of interest that HSP90 is also thought to
regulate the activity of Rab GTPase-dependent endocytic
recycling by its association with a Rab Guanine
Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor (GDI) [78, 79], and
HSP90 inhibitors could potentially help attenuate Rabdependent recycling of transmembrane receptors that
are not direct HSP90 clients to enhance the intracellular
delivery of ADCs or ANPs. Other factors that may control
trafficking of oncogenic cell-surface receptors such as
the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src, endocytic adaptor
proteins, E3 ubiquitin ligases, deubiquitinating enzymes,
RAB GTPases, ESCRT proteins and EHD family
proteins,[80-83] may offer future opportunities to develop
facilitators of ADC and ANP traffic to endolysosome
compartments as approaches of therapeutic potentiation.

(3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) was purchased from Research Products
International (Prospect, IL). All other chemicals were of
reagent grade and used without further purification. The
following primary antibodies were used in this study:
mouse monoclonal anti-human-ErbB2 (raised against
the C-terminal 1242-1255 amino acid residues) used for
Western blotting studies from BD Pharmingen™ (San
Diego, CA); goat anti-human-ErbB2 polyclonal (AF1129)
used for flow cytometry and immunofluorescence
studies from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); mouse
monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-pY; 4G10) kindly
provided by Dr. Brian Druker (Oregon Health & Science
University, Portland, OR); and mouse monoclonal antiHsc70 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz,
CA).

Synthesis of the NGs
NGs were synthesized essentially as described [37,
38]. Briefly, PEG-b-PMA/Ca2+ complexes were prepared
by mixing an aqueous solution of PEG-b-PMA with a
solution of CaCl2 at a molar ratio of [Ca2+]/[COO−] =
1.3. The chains were cross-linked overnight at room
temperature (RT, using EDC and 1,2-ethylenediamine
([EDC]/[1,2-ethylenediamine] = 2; [COOH]/[EDC] = 5).
The synthesized NGs were extensively dialyzed (MW
Cut-off 3.5 kDa) against 0.5% aqueous ammonia in the
presence of 100 mM EDTA followed by double distilled
water.

CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates the potential of
therapeutically exploiting the vulnerabilities in cancer
cell-specific trafficking behavior of receptors used
to selectively deliver nano-encapsulated therapeutic
agents, and highlights the importance of identifying such
vulnerabilities in target receptors in order to fully realize
the potential of ADCs and targeted nanomedicines in
cancer and other diseases.

Synthesis and characterization of Trastuzumabmodified and DOX-loaded NGs

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Trastuzumab (Trast) or mouse IgG (control)
conjugation to NGs through a streptavidin-biotin complex
(Figure 1) followed the following steps:

Materials
Trastuzumab was obtained from UNMC Pharmacy.
PEG-b-PMA di-block copolymer (Mw/Mn = 1.45)
was purchased from Polymer Source Inc., Canada.
The block lengths were 170 and 180 repeating units
for PEG and PMA, respectively. The concentration
of carboxylate groups in the copolymer samples was
estimated by potentiometric titration. FMOC-PEG-NHS
was purchased from Creative PEGWorks, NC. Calcium
chloride, Ethylenediamine, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)3-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride
(EDC)
and
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Doxorubicin
hydrochloride was kindly provided by Dong-A
Pharmaceutical Company, South Korea. Fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (dialyzed and heat-inactivated), Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), RPMI-1640
medium and LysotrackerTM (green) were purchased
from Invitrogen Inc. (Carlsbad, CA). MTT reagent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PEGylation of streptavidin
6 ml of 1 mg/ml (16.7 µM) streptavidin in 50 mM
sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3) was added dropwise
to 1 ml of 1.5 mg/ml (150 µM) solution of Fmoc-PEGNHS (Mw = 10 kDa; 1.5 fold molar excess with respect
to streptavidin) in the same buffer. The mixture was
incubated for 2h at RT. Fmoc groups were removed by
adding 0.5 µL of 20% piperidine/DMF (5 fold molar
excess over Fmoc) and incubating the reaction mixture
for 10 min at RT. The resulting construct (NH2-PEGstreptavidin) was purified through repeated ultrafiltration
(MW Cut-Off 30,000, Millipore) at 3000 rpm for 15 min
(3 washes with water) to remove unreacted PEG. The
absence of free PEG was confirmed by size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) on a Sepharose CL-6B-based
column, using an ÄKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences).

Insertion of NH2-PEG-streptavidin into NGs

[32, 84]. The cell lines were obtained from ATCC, except
for 21MT-1, which has been described by one of the
coauthors, Dr. Vimla Band [85].

Carboxylate groups within the NG core were
activated with 300 µL of 1 mg/ml EDC solution for 15
min. A 10-fold excess of EDC with respect to NH2-PEGstreptavidin (to be added in the subsequent step) was used
to ensure maximal incorporation of NH2-PEG-streptavidin
into the NG core. Insertion of NH2-PEG-streptavidin into
NGs was achieved through the reaction between free NH2
groups of PEG with EDC-activated carboxyl acid core of
NGs. The mixture was allowed to react for 2 h followed by
purification of streptavidin-NG conjugate using repeated
ultrafiltration (MW Cut-Off 100,000, Millipore) at 4500
rpm for 30 min (3 washes with water) to remove any
unreacted PEG-Streptavidin. The absence of free PEGStreptavidin was confirmed by SEC, as above. The amount
of streptavidin n the streptavidin-NG conjugate was
measured by the Bradford method using a BioRad assay
kit (BioRad, Richmond, CA, USA) with BSA as standard.

Confocal microscopy
To examine the cellular uptake and subcellular
localization of Trast-NG by confocal microscopy (Carl
Zeiss LSM 510 Meta, Peabody, MA), SKBr-3 cells were
plated on glass slides placed within 12-well plates (1×105
per well). Trast-NGs without DOX were incubated with
SKBr-3 cells at 37oC for 1h. 17-AAG (100 nM) was then
added for 2, 4 or 8h, and cells washed in PBS and fixed in
4% parafolmaldehyde in PBS. Trast-NGs were visualized
by staining Trastuzumab with FITC-conjugated mouse
anti-Human monoclonal antibody (green). ErbB2 was
stained either with a goat anti-ErbB2 antibody (AF1129)
against the extracellular domain of ErbB2 or a mouse
monoclonal antibody against the C-terminal tail of ErbB2
(BD Pharmingen) followed by Alexa594-conjugated antigoat or anti-mouse antibody, respectively. Lysosomes were
identified by staining with mouse anti-human LAMP-1
monoclonal antibody followed by Alexa-594-conjugated
goat anti-mouse antibody.

Preparation of Trast-NG via streptavidin-biotin
complex, and drug loading
Trastuzumab (or control IgG) was biotinylated using
EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (ThermoFisher Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. StreptavidinNGs were mixed with biotinylated Trastuzumab (or
control IgG) at a 1:2 streptavidin to biotin ratio and
incubated for 2h at RT. The mAb-NG was purified by
SEC, to remove all unbound mAb, yielding a mixture of
unmodified NG and mAb-NGs. The amount of Trast or
IgG in conjugated NGs was measured by the Bradford
method. Streptavidin-NG alone was used as a control to
subtract the values contributed by Streptavidin portion to
the total protein in the mAb-NG. DOX-loaded Trast-NGs
or control IgG/NGs were prepared by adding DOX to an
aqueous dispersion of NGs (pH 7.0) at a feeding ratio (R)
of [Dox]/[COO-] = 0.25 and the mixture incubated for 24
h. Unbound DOX was removed by repeated ultrafiltration
(MW Cut-Off 30,000, Millipore), as above.

Cell cycle analysis
To assess the effect of DOX to arrest the cell cycle
[84], 21MT-1 or MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates
for 24h and exposed to various concentrations of TrastNG/DOX (1.7 - 13.3 μM Dox) for 6h, followed by a
further 18h incubation without (control) or with 100 nM
17-AAG. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI)
and cell cycle distribution assessed by FACS analysis [32,
84].

Analysis of NGs against BT-474 tumor xenografts

Determination of NG particle size and zetapotential

107 BT-474 cells in 100 µL of 50% Matrigel
(BD Biosciences, California) in media were injected
into mammary fat pads of 4-6 week old female nude
mice (Athymic NCr-nu/nu; NCI Fredrick National
Lab, Fredrick, MD) that had received subcutaneous
17-β-Estradiol pellets (0.72mg/pellet; 60 day release;
Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) on the
lateral side of the neck 3 days earlier. 14 days later, mice
with tumor volumes ranging between 100-200 mm3
were stratified into groups and started on the following
treatments via tail vein injections every 4 days: 1) 5 %
dextrose (Control); 2) Trast alone (3 mg/kg); 3) IgGNG/DOX (6 mg/kg); 4) IgG-NG/DOX (6 mg/kg) + free
17AAG (1 mg/kg); 5) Trast-NG/DOX (6 mg/kg); 7) TrastNG/DOX (6 mg/kg) + free 17AAG (1 mg/kg). 17-AAG
was administered 2 h after NGs. Body weight and tumor

The intensity-mean Z-averaged particle diameter
(Deff) and ζ-potential of NGs were measured at 25°C using
a Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern,
UK), set in an automatic mode. The vendor-provided
software was used to calculate size, polydispersity indices
and ζ-potential of NGs from measurements performed at
least in triplicate.

Cell culture conditions
The ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines
SKBr-3, 21MT1 and BT-474, and a representative ErbB2low line MCF-7 were maintained, as previously described

volume were monitored every other day. Tumor volume
(V = 0.5 x L x W2) was estimated by measuring two
orthogonal diameters (longer dimension: L, and smaller
dimension: W) of the tumor using electronic calipers.
Mice were sacrificed when tumor volume exceeded 2000
mm3, greatest tumor dimension exceeded 20 mm, tumor
became necrotic, or animals lost more than 20% of body
weight. All other animals were sacrificed by day 78 after
start of treatment. All animal studies were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Apoptosis and proliferation
Tumors were excised from 2-3 tumor-bearing mice
per treatment group treatments at day 14 of treatment,
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded
(UNMC Tissue Sciences Facility, Omaha, NE). 4-μm
thick tissue sections were analyzed for proliferating and
apoptotic cells using immunohistochemistry (IHC) with
antibodies against Ki-67 and caspase-3, respectively, with
visualization with DAB+ (brown for Ki-67; permanent
red for caspase-3) (DAKO) for 2 min. The sections
were rinsed with distilled water and counterstained
with hematoxylin. Ki-67 and caspase-3 expression was
quantified by determining the area occupied by positivelystained cells (using ImageJ software) in 5 random highpower fields (at 20× magnification) and dividing by the
total area of cells per field.

Statistical analysis
Differences between treatment groups were
analyzed for significance using the Student t-test assuming
a type I error (α) = 0.05. For in vivo antitumor effects and
toxicity analyses, group means for tumor volume and body
weights, respectively, were evaluated using the repeated
measures analysis of variance. Survival was estimated
using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the logrank test. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.
Analysis of variance and Kaplan-Meier analysis were
performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software,
Inc.). Median survival time for the various groups and
the associated Confidence Interval limits were derived by
running PROC LIFETEST in SAS (Statistical Analysis
System) software.
