ABSTRACT
Despite the efficacy of decitabine to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), there is a
wide range of responses, and no definite predictive marker has been identified. This
study aimed to describe the efficacy of decitabine and to identify potential predictors
of response and survival in patients with MDS. We retrospectively analyzed clinical
data of MDS patients at Samsung Medical Center between August 2008 and August
2011. The response assessment was conducted using the International Working Group
(IWG) response criteria for MDS. We analyzed 101 MDS patients (total 613 cycles)
who received decitabine for a median of four cycles. The overall response was 52.5%
(n = 53/101). The median time to any response was two cycles with the median
overall survival of 16.7 months. Patients who showed hematologic improvement had
significantly longer survival than those who did not (9.8 vs. 22.9 months, p = 0.004).
The difference in OS was evident in the Intermediate-2/High risk group (p = 0.002)
but not in the Intermediate-1 risk group (p = 0.145). Multivariate analysis confirmed
that platelet response (no platelet transfusions for at least 3 days) during the second
cycle of treatment was an independent predictor for response, OS and Leukemia
free survival. Based on the results of this study, for patients with hematological
improvement, recovery of platelet count by the second cycle of therapy can be used
as an early predictive marker of improved survival and an increased response rate.

INTRODUCTION

International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) remains
the most widely used prognostic system for therapeutic
decisions. The IPSS advises the use of supportive care
with transfusion and growth factor supplementation as
treatment in lower risk groups of patients. Allogeneic
stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment
for the high risk group; however, in the post-epigenetic
therapy era, treatment approaches for patients with MDS
have improved significantly. Specifically, hypomethylating
agents improve the transfusion requirement and quality
of life while decreasing leukemic transformation and
survival. Azacitidine [1-3] and decitabine [4-6] are
currently the two available agents with the capacity to

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group
of clonal hematopoietic disorders marked by ineffective
hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias, and an increased
risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. MDS is
associated with a wide array of clinical manifestations and
treatment outcomes.
MDS treatment is based on prognostic factors
that predict survival and likelihood of progression to
AML. Currently, development of prognostic systems
that allow for risk stratification and that can guide the
timing and choice of MDS therapy is needed. The

methyltransferase inhibitors have become the mainstay
of MDS treatment since being approved in the United
States and Europe for the treatment of higher risk MDS
(i.e., intermediate-2 and high risk, according to the IPSS
guidelines). Azacitidine has been studied in higher-risk
MDS patients in two randomized multicenter trials, which
include Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9221 [7]
and AZA-001 [1]. Decitabine, a DNA-methyltransferase
inhibitor, has a wide range of overall response rates
from 30%-60% based on literature published in Western
countries [4, 8-10] and Korea [11]. However, the nonresponse rate for hypomethylating agents is high.
Additionally, there are few studies investigating the
treatment response in Asian populations, and there is
no known predictive marker for response to decitabine
therapy. It is known that pretreatment risk stratification is
related to MDS patient survival outcome. Therefore, we
aimed to assess the efficacy of decitabine and to identify
predictors of response to decitabine therapy.

(47.5%), most of whom demonstrated a response (N = 31,
64.6%) within two cycles of decitabine therapy.

Predictive factors of treatment response and
survival
The median overall survival duration in all the
patients was 16.7 months (range, 0.9-60.8 months).
Univariate analysis showed that IPSS, the WHO
classification-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS)
and the platelet response during the second cycle of
decitabine all significantly predicted favorable ORR, OS
and LFS (Table 4, Table 5 and Figure 1).
Figure 2 shows the relationship between m-CR and
OS in patients with bone marrow blasts >5%. The OS in
patients with marrow complete remission (m-CR) was not
significantly different compared to that of patients without
m-CR (p-value = 0.353). However, the patients who
showed hematologic improvement (HI) had a significantly
higher survival rate than those who did not (11.8 vs. 23.8
months, p = 0.001) (Table 6.). The median OS in patients
without HI during or after decitabine treatment was 9.8
months, and the median OS in patients with HI was 22.9
months (p-value = 0.004, Figure 3). The difference in OS
was evident in the Intermediate-2/High risk group (p-value
= 0.002) but not in the Intermediate-1 risk group (p-value
0.145, Figure 3).
Multivariate analysis indicated that the platelet
response during the second cycle of decitabine treatment
significantly predicted ORR, OS and LFS (Table 7).

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
We identified 101 consecutive patients who
received decitabine as first-line treatment for MDS
and had available clinical and pathologic data between
January 2008 and December 2011. Patient demographics
are described in Table 1. The median age was 65 years
(range, 18-84 years old), and 30% of the patients were
women. There was no significant difference in the baseline
characteristics of responding and non-responding patients.

DISCUSSION
The results of this study suggest that the platelet
response that occurs during the second cycle of decitabine
can predict the overall response and survival of MDS
patients.
Currently, genetic oncology faces the challenge of
identifying patients who will be benefit from target agents.
Therefore, biomarkers that can guide clinical decisions and
predict the response to treatment are needed. Additionally,
identifying patients who will derive the greatest clinical
benefit from hypomethylating agents remains a challenge;
however, this could be resolved by identifying biomarkers
that predict patient response.
Unlike conventional chemotherapy, several cycles of
treatment with a hypomethylating agent are often needed
to appreciate the effect of the therapy. In both the CALGB
9221 and AZA-001 azacitidine trials, several courses of
therapy (four to six cycles) were required to achieve a
response. In a small portion of patients, responses could
be observed after up to 12 cycles of therapy. Therefore,
the ability to predict response to treatment at an earlier
time is needed.

Treatment response
A total of 613 cycles of decitabine treatment were
administered in 101 patients with MDS. The median
follow-up period was 20.7 months (range: 1.0-89.6
months). The median number of decitabine treatment
cycles was four (range: 1-34 cycles). The median number
of cycles to any response was two (range: 1-17 cycles),
and the median time to best response was 2.3 months
(Table 6). Of the patients who received decitabine, the
overall response rate (ORR, Complete response(CR),
Partial response(PR), Marrow complete response(mCR)
and Hematologic improvement(HI)) was observed in 51
of 101 patients (50.5%) (Table 2). Among the patients that
responded to decitabine treatment, 37 (72.5%) showed a
treatment response within two cycles of treatment, and 14
patients (27.5%) showed a treatment response after two
cycles of decitabine treatment (Table 3). Platelet response
during decitabine treatment was indicated in 48 patients

There exist very few studies about hypomethylating
agent predictive markers in MDS patients. In previous
studies, pretreatment risk stratification was based on IPSS
or WPSS, and initial LDH level was beneficial for OS in
patients treated with azacitidine [12, 13]. Previous low
dose ara-C treatment, bone marrow blasts >15%, poor
performance and more than four units of red blood cells
transfused every eight weeks were factors that predicted
a lower response rate to 5-azacitidine [14]. In addition,
some reports demonstrated that specific cytogenetic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

abnormalities may be associated with a better response
to hypomethylating agents [15, 16]. Recently, specific
molecular mutations in the methylation pathway have
been identified, including TET2, DNMT3A and IDH/IDH2
[17-19]; however, these methylation machinery genes
were detected in only 10-30% of MDS patients [20, 21].
Lee et al. [11] demonstrated that decitabine
treatment prolonged OS in patients that achieved
hematologic improvement. Previous randomized trials
reported significant prolongation of OS or LFS in higher

risk MDS patients receiving hypomethylating agents, but
these agents did not lower the disease risk [4]. Similarly,
our results showed that the patients who showed HI
exhibited significantly increased survival compared to
patients who did not show HI. The patients who showed
hematologic improvements (HI) had significantly longer
survival rates than those who did not (11.8 vs 23.8 months,
p = 0.001) (Table 6.) In comparison, the OS in patients
with mCR was not statistically different compared to that
of those without m-CR. Specifically, we noted that HI was
achieved and indicated by the platelet response.

Few reports have analyzed platelet response as a
predictive factor of patient survival [22, 23]. Decitabine
has a 20%-50% response rate for thrombocytopenia
in MDS patients. Decitabine enhances normal
megakaryocyte outgrowth and differentiation of normal
megakaryocytes into platelets [24]. Platelet level has often
been observed as the first response to treatment, whereas
red cell count and neutrophilic granulocyte count respond
later during therapy. The neutrophil response may be
delayed due to the slow disappearance of blasts from the
bone marrow [23]. Hypomethylation of genes important

for megakaryopoesis may be functionally linked by
5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. This hypothesis is based on the
observed hypermethylated promotor region of the p15
tumor suppressor gene [22]. Liekee et al. reported that a
two-fold increase in platelet count after the first cycle of
azacitidine treatment predicted longer OS and may be a
useful early indicator of favorable azacitidine treatment
outcome [23] in MDS and AML patients. The results
indicated that 16% of patients with MDS and AML had an
increased platelet count after the first cycle of azacitidine,
which was associated with a significantly better OS rate.
However, in this study, only seven MDS patient who
received azacitidine had an increased platelet count. In our
study, most MDS patients (N=31/48, 64.6%) showed an
increased platelet count within two cycles of decitabine.
By the second cycle, the platelet response was a significant
predictive factor for OS and LFS after adjusting for known
predictors (IPSS).
Our study was limited because of its retrospective
nature. Additional studies that include a larger number
of patients treated homogenously with hypomethylating
agents are needed for external validation. In the future,
we will use Sanger sequencing to investigate mutations
in methylating machinery genes (TET2 and DNMT3A) in
patients who receive decitabine as a first-line treatment.
. Two hypomethylating agents are currently available.
However, only azacitidine has been shown to be associated
with prolonged survival in prospective study until now.
In our study, patients received decitabine treatment.
Hypomethylating agents are considered today as the first
line treatment for MDS patients classified as INT-2 and
High-risk IPSS. However, in this study, 49.8% of the
patient population are classified as Low and INT-1. In this
respect, our study has limitation.
In conclusion, decitabine is effective (ORR
50.5%) and can cause a rapid platelet response that is
apparent by the second treatment cycle in MDS patients.
Overall survival is significantly longer in patients with
hematologic improvement. Based on the results of this
study, for patients with hematological improvement,
recovery of platelets by the second cycle of therapy can
be used as an early predictive marker of improved survival
and an increased response rate.

Decitabine was given intravenously over one hour
at a dose of 20 mg/m2 daily for five consecutive days, and
each course was repeated every four weeks. All patients
received decitabine treatment as first-line treatment.
Physicians were advised to continue decitabine treatment
for at least four courses unless a patient either died,
experienced unacceptable adverse events, or withdrew
from the study. Bone marrow examination was conducted
with every two courses until complete remission (CR) was
confirmed. Prophylactic antimicrobials, hematopoietic
growth factors and other supportive care were
administered at the discretion of the treating physician.

Response criteria
The response assessment was conducted using the
International Working Group (IWG) response criteria
for myelodysplasia [25]. The hematologic response was
evaluated during each cycle, and patients who were
classified as high or intermediate-2 according to the IPSS
underwent a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate their response
to treatment. A complete response (CR) required the
disappearance of all signs and symptoms, a bone marrow
biopsy with less than 5% blasts, peripheral blood count
with an absolute neutrophil count of 1×109/L or more,
and a platelet count of 100×109/L or more. A marrowCR (mCR) was defined as a bone marrow blast less than
5% that did not meet peripheral blood count criteria. A
partial response (PR) was defined as a reduction in the
blast count to less than 50% but more than 5%. Response
criteria for CR and PR required a treatment duration of
at least four weeks. All HI was determined based on the
modified IWG criteria. The HI are measured in patients
with pretreatment abnormal values: hemoglobin level less
than 110 g/L (11g/dL) or RBC-transfusion dependence,
platelet count less than 100 x 109/L or platelet-transfusion
dependence, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than
1.0 x 109/L. Pretreatment baseline measures of cytopenias
are averages of at least 2 measurements (not influenced by
transfusions, ie, no RBC transfusions for at least 1 week
and no platelet transfusions for at least 3 days) over at
least 1 week prior to therapy.
Major and minor HI must last for at least 8 weeks.
An overall response rate (ORR) was defined according
to CR, PR, mCR and HI. Overall survival was measured
from the date of initiation of decitabine therapy to the date
of death or the last follow-up visit. Leukemia-free survival
was measured from the date of initiation of decitabine
therapy to the date of death or leukemic transformation.
