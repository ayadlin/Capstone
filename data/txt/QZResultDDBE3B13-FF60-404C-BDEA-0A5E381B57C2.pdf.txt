Abstract

Author Manuscript

Most of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) cases carry the t(2;5; p23;q35) that produces
the fusion protein NPM-ALK. NPM-ALK deregulated kinase activity drives several pathways that
support malignant transformation of lymphoma cells. We found that in ALK-rearranged ALCL
cell lines NPM-ALK was distributed in equal amounts between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
Only the cytoplasmic portion was catalytically active in both cell lines and primary ALCL,
whereas the nuclear portion was inactive due to heterodimerization with NPM1. Thus, about 50%
of the NPM-ALK is not active and sequestered as NPM-ALK/NPM1 heterodimers in the nucleus.
Overexpression or re-localization of NPM-ALK to the cytoplasm by NPM genetic knock-out or

knock-down caused ERK1/2 increased phosphorylation and cell death through the engagement of
an ATM/Chk2 and γH2AX mediated DNA damage response. Remarkably, human NPM-ALK
amplified cell lines resistant to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) underwent apoptosis upon
drug withdrawal as a consequence of ERK1/2 hyperactivation. Altogether, these findings indicate
that an excess of NPM-ALK activation and signaling induces apoptosis via oncogenic stress
responses. A “drug holiday” where the ALK TKI treatment is suspended could represent a
therapeutic option in cells that become resistant by NPM-ALK amplification.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Recurrent genetic alterations of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene on
chromosome 2 have been reported in different hematological and solid tumors1, 2. The t(2;5)
is by far the most frequent translocation in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL)
involving the nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene as a partner of translocation1, 3. Several other
partner genes have been described in ALCL and other tumors2. All ALK fusion partners
contain domains that allow the dimerization of the fusion chimera and the activation of the
ALK kinase. NPM-ALK spontaneously dimerizes through the NPM1 oligomerization
domain, trans-phosphorylates the kinase domain and activates downstream pathways that
sustain lymphoma cell proliferation and survival. Cellular localization of ALK fusions
depends on the fusion partner and the majority of ALK chimeras are entirely cytoplasmic1, 4.
NPM-ALK is the only ALK chimera localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
Previous works demonstrated that the cytoplasmic localization of ALK fusions is required
for cellular transformation5, 6, but no precise role has yet been assigned to the nuclear NPMALK or to the balance between its nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Understanding the
functions of the NPM-ALK cell fractions could be exploited in the development of new
therapeutic strategies that interfere with the physiological balance of NPM-ALK
cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions in ALCL. Indeed, drugs that inhibit nuclear-cytoplasmic
transport, so called selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE), have shown strong antitumoral activity in preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies and are currently in early-phase
clinical trials for advanced hematological malignances and solid tumors7, 8. Moreover,
previous studies demonstrated that in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the combined
use of imatinib, the selective inhibitor of the CML oncogenic driver kinase BCR-ABL, and
leptomycin B, a “precursor” molecule of SINE, was more effective in killing cells than the
inhibitor alone9.
The recent discovery of specific ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has dramatically
changed the way patients bearing ALK-rearranged tumors are treated10, 11. In ALKrearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) crizotinib, as well as next generation ALK
TKIs such as ceritinib, alectinib or brigatinib, have proven clinical efficacy12-14.
Unfortunately, each TKI treatment is invariably associated with the development of TKI
resistance and NSCLC relapse15-18. Similarly to NSCLC patients, crizotinib resistance

occurs in a fraction of ALCL patients19. Understanding the mechanisms of ALK TKI
resistance is critical to envision new treatment strategies to maximize the clinical benefits for
ALK-rearranged ALCL patients. To date most of the data on the mechanisms of resistance
to ALK TKI have been collected in NSCLC patients20-23, whereas very few data are
available for ALCL. Mechanisms of acquired resistance to ALK TKI in ALK-rearranged
ALCL have been described mainly in vitro by our group and others, including single point
mutations of the TK domain and amplification of the ALK fusion gene24-28. Amplification
of the ALK fusion gene has also been described in ALK-rearranged NSCLC and leads to
increased expression of the oncogenic ALK fusion that requires increasing dosage of ALK
TKI to be treated. Overexpression of a driver oncogene as a mechanism of resistance to TKI
has been also reported in CML patients treated with imatinib29. Remarkably, acute overactivation following imatinib suspension in BCR-ABL amplified imatinib-resistant cells
induces apoptosis of resistant cells29-31. In another notable example, melanoma cells
develop resistance to B-RAF inhibitors, and B-RAF TKI suspension in resistant cells
induces cell toxicity mediated by an excess of B-RAF oncogenic signaling32. Similar
observations have been described in a few other cancer models33, 34. Overall, these data
indicate that an intermitting administration of a TKI could represent a therapeutic approach
designed to overcome TKI resistance in different tumors.

Author Manuscript

In this study we show that NPM-ALK is equally distributed between the cytoplasm and the
nuclear fractions, where nuclear NPM-ALK is inactive. This nuclear sequestration is critical
for optimal survival of ALCL cells because an excess of NPM-ALK signaling causes
oncogenic toxicity by activation of the DNA damage response pathway. Consistently, NPMALK amplified ALCL cells that developed resistance to the TKI brigatinib underwent
massive apoptosis upon TKI suspension because of an excess of NPM-ALK activation.
Thus, periodic ALK TKI suspension, a so-called “drug holiday”, may represent an effective
treatment for ALCL patients developing TKI resistance by ALK amplification.

RESULTS
NPM-ALK is equally localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of ALCL cells, but it is
phosphorylated only in the cytoplasm

Author Manuscript

NPM-ALK is by far the most frequent fusion in ALK-rearranged ALCL, yet the only one
localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus1, 2. Previous works demonstrated that the
cytoplasmic localization of ALK fusions is needed for cell transformation, but never fully
elucidated the role of the nuclear fraction5, 6. Therefore, we first analyzed NPM-ALK
subcellular localization to better investigate the role of its nuclear fraction. We found that in
all ALK-rearranged ALCL cell lines, NPM-ALK fusion was equally distributed between
cytoplasm and nucleus, as previously reported in one cell line5, but, surprisingly, only the
cytoplasmic fraction was phosphorylated and thereby kinetically active (Fig. 1A).
Consistently, a phospho-ALK (Y1604) antibody stained only the cytoplasm in primary
ALK-rearranged ALCL indicating that the NPM-ALK nuclear fraction was not active (Fig.
1B). Thus, despite NPM-ALK is expressed in equal amounts in the cytoplasm and in the
nucleus in ALCL cells, only the half cytoplasmic fraction of the total NPM-ALK protein is
catalytically active.

Enforced expression of NPM-ALK in the nucleus does not transform cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In the NPM-ALK fusion, NPM1 is truncated by the t(2;5) translocation before the nuclear
(NLS) and the nucleolar localization signals (NuLS)(Fig 1C). Thus, we reasoned that NPMALK can enter the nucleus only as a heterodimer with WT NPM1, and that these nuclear
heterodimers are inactive because of lack of trans-phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis
we first generated a fusion NPM-ALK construct containing the total NPM1 protein
(NPMtot-ALK) (Fig 1C). When expressed in 293T cells, NPMtot-ALK localized entirely to
the nucleus and the nucleolus due to the now conserved NPM1 NLS and NuLS, whereas
NPM-ALK localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Fig. 1D and Supplementary
Fig. 1A-B). Next we tested the cell transformation potential of NPMtot-ALK in two
independent assays. First, we stably transduced NPM-ALK, the kinase dead mutant K210R
(NPM-ALKKD) and NPMtot-ALK constructs into NIH3T3 cells and performed an
anchorage-independent cell growth assay. NIH3T3 cells expressing the NPMtot-ALK
showed limited anchorage-independent growth with few colonies growing in soft-agar
similar to the inactive NPM-ALKKD, strikingly less than NIH3T3 cells expressing
oncogenic NPM-ALK (Fig. 1E-F). Second, we used the murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)
dependent pro-B cell line Ba/F3. In this assay, the ectopic expression of NPM-ALK enabled
Ba/F3 cells to grow in absence of IL-3, whereas neither NPM-ALKKD nor NPMtot-ALK did
(Fig. 1G-H). Overall, these results indicate that NPM-ALK is sequestered by WT NPM1 in
the nucleus in an inactive, non phosphorylated form. However, should active NPM-ALK
homodimers form in the nucleus by release of heterodimers, they would be still unable to
transform cells because of a lack of signaling as the experiments with the NPMtot-ALK
fusion indicate.

In the absence of WT NPM1, NPM-ALK expression is localized to the cytoplasm but
induces cell death

Author Manuscript

To further elucidate the role of WT NPM1 in NPM-ALK oncogenic signaling, we
transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that lack NPM1 (NPM−/− MEF) with
retroviruses expressing NPM-ALK, NPM-ALKKD or NPMtot-ALK. Because NPM−/− cells
do not proliferate in vitro and acquire a senescent phenotype in the presence of p53, we used
NPM−/−/p53−/− double-deficient MEFs and p53−/− MEFs as controls for NPM1
expression35. In contrast to NIH3T3 cells and p53−/− MEFs, in NPM−/−/p53−/− MEFs,
NPM-ALK and the kinase dead NPM-ALKKD were now localized only in the cytoplasm
further confirming that, without NPM1, NPM-ALK homodimers cannot enter the nucleus
and are localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A-B). In NPM−/−/p53−/− MEFs, cytoplasmic NPMALK was catalytically active (Fig. 2A right-top panels). NPM-ALK expression was well
tolerated in p53−/− MEFs whereas, quite surprisingly, it induced apoptosis in NPM−/−/p53−/−
MEFs with elevated activation of Caspase 3/7 (Fig. 2C-D). On the contrary, NPMtot-ALK
was largely nuclear in both NPM−/−/p53−/− and p53−/− MEFs (Fig. 2A), but well tolerated as
the NPM-ALKKD (Fig. 2C-D). Cell localization experiments of NPM-ALK in NPM−/−/
p53−/− MEFs was not doable because of the massive apoptosis of the cells.
Thus, lack of NPM-ALK sequestration by WT NPM1 induces NPM-ALK accumulation in
the cytoplasm resulting in cell apoptosis rather than transformation.

We next investigated the effects of knocking-down the endogenous WT NPM1 in ALKrearranged ALCL cell lines. We transduced ALK-rearranged ALCL cell lines (SU-DHL-1,
COST, TS and KARPAS 299) with two different shRNA targeting NPM1 (Fig. 3A and
Supplementary Fig. 2A). The ALK-negative ALCL cell line, FEPD, was used as control.
When NPM1 was knocked-down NPM-ALK phosphorylation increased compared to control
cells, as we observed in NPM−/−/p53−/− MEFs, likely due to the accumulation of NPM-ALK
homodimers in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 2A). The accumulation of
NPM-ALK in the cytoplasm led to apoptosis of ALK-rearranged ALCL cells (Fig 3B-D and
Supplementary Fig. 2B). No apoptosis was observed after NPM1 silencing in control ALKcell line FEPD (Fig. 3E).

Author Manuscript

These results indicate that in the absence of WT NPM1 the amount of phosphorylated NPMALK increases and that the excess of NPM-ALK signaling could be responsible for ALCL
apoptosis.
Overexpression of NPM-ALK in the cytoplasm of ALCL cells induces apoptosis of
lymphoma cells

Author Manuscript

Prompted by these results, we investigated in more details the effects of NPM-ALK
overexpression in ALK-rearranged ALCL cells. Four different ALK-rearranged ALCL cell
lines (SU-DHL-1, COST, TS and KARPAS 299) and, as control, one ALK-negative
lymphoma cell line (MAC-1) were first transduced with a TetON lentivirus and then with
lentiviruses containing NPM-ALK or NPM-ALKKD to create a doxycycline-inducible
system to overexpress NPM-ALK or NPM-ALKKD upon doxycycline addition (Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Fig. 3A and 4A). Overexpression of NPM-ALK in ALK-rearranged cells
was mainly localized to the cytoplasm and caused a marked increase in the amount of
phosphorylated NPM-ALK (Fig. 4B). Although ALK-rearranged ALCL cells are strongly
dependent on ALK kinase activity and signaling for their viability and proliferation,
overexpression of NPM-ALK caused a significant increase in apoptosis and activation of
caspases 3 and 7 within 48-72 hours after doxycycline induction (Fig. 4C-F and
Supplementary Fig. 3B-C). Similar effects were observed by ectopic expression of NPMALK in ALK-negative lymphoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 4B).
Consistent with the in vitro results, overexpression of NPM-ALK in ALK-rearranged ALCL
cells completely impaired cell growth in vivo. Indeed, no tumors were detected in s.c.
xenografts of SU-DHL-1 and COST after overexpression of NPM-ALK (Fig. 4G-H).

Author Manuscript

Overall, these data indicate that higher expression levels of NPM-ALK in ALCL induce a
relative increase of the cytoplasmic portion likely because the stoichiometric balance
between NPM1 and NPM-ALK is altered. The increased cytoplasmic NPM-ALK results in
apoptosis and lymphoma growth impairment. Thus, sequestration of about 50% of the NPMALK fusion is necessary to maintain the proper amount of ALK signaling.
Overexpression of NPM-ALK causes DNA damage and accumulation of γH2AX microfoci
through activation of the MAPK pathway
Because oncogenes can induce apoptosis or senescence in response to DNA damage through
replicative stress36, 37, we asked whether an excess of NPM-ALK signaling would activate

an oncogene-induced DNA damage response. We observed that ALK-rearranged ALCL
cells overexpressing NPM-ALK displayed increased phosphorylation of the H2A histone
family member X (H2AX), a key protein in the DNA repair pathway, and accumulation of
phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) microfoci in the nuclei at DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs) (Fig. 5A-C and Supplementary Fig. 5A-B and 6A). Overexpression of the NPMALKKD did not cause formation of γH2AX microfoci (Fig. 5B-C and Supplementary Fig.
5A). Along with the accumulation of γH2AX, overexpression of NPM-ALK caused the
localization of the p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1), another key player of the DNA damage
response pathway, at foci overtime (Supplementary Fig. 7A-B).

As DNA damage generated by oncogenic stress results from the activation of one of two
main DNA-damage checkpoint pathways, the ATM-Chk2 and the ATR-Chk138-40, we
investigated whether the overexpression of NPM-ALK was associated with the activation of
ATM/ATR/Chk pathway. We found that overexpression of NPM-ALK led mainly to the
phosphorylation of Chk2 more than Chk1 or RPA32 (Fig.5D and Supplementary Fig. 5C, 6B
and 8A). We also observed that excessive NPM-ALK signaling caused marked increase in
the phosphorylation of the MAPK-ERK1/2 pathway, that has been described to mediate
oncogenic stress (Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig. 5B and 6A)41. To test whether hyper
stimulation of cells through MAPK pathway was responsible for the DNA damage and
phosphorylation of H2AX, we treated cells with a specific MEK inhibitor, CI-1040
(PD184352). SU-DHL-1 and COST cells were induced with doxycycline for 24h and
concomitantly treated with CI-1040. In cells overexpressing NPM-ALK, the inhibition of
MEK resulted in marked dephosphorylation of H2AX (Fig. 5E). Similarly, the ectopic
expression of NPM-ALK in MAC-1 cells caused a strong activation of the MEK/ERK1/2
pathway and a marked increase in the phosphorylation of H2AX (Supplementary Fig. 8B).
Inhibition of the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway decreased H2AX phosphorylation (Supplementary
Fig. 8B). Thus, these data indicate that excess of NPM-ALK signaling induces a DNA
damage response that is mediated by the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway.
KARPAS 299 resistant to the ALK TKI brigatinib (AP26113) overexpress NPM-ALK and
are TKI dependent

Author Manuscript

We and others recently described genomic amplification of the ALK locus as a mechanism
of ALK TKI resistance 26, 28. We reported three ALK-rearranged cell lines (K299AR300A,
K299AR300B, K299AR300C) whose resistance to the ALK inhibitor brigatinib was
mediated by genomic amplification that caused NPM-ALK overexpression (Fig. 6A)26.
Interestingly, in all resistant cell lines overexpressed NPM-ALK was mainly localized in the
cytoplasm both in presence and in absence of the inhibitor, a finding in line with our data on
ectopic overexpression of NPM-ALK (Fig. 4 and 6B). Surprisingly, these cell lines showed
the highest proliferative rate not in the absence of ALK TKI, but in the presence of low
doses (40nM) of brigatinib. Indeed, inhibitor dose-response curves showed an abnormal
proliferative peak around 40nM brigatinib in NPM-ALK amplified ALCL but not in parental
cells (Fig. 6C). The cells showed the same abnormal dose-response curves upon inhibition
with other ALK TKIs (crizotinib, alectinib, ceritinib and ASP3026) or with a HSP90
inhibitor (17-AAG) that causes NPM-ALK down-regulation (Supplementary Fig. 9). Thus,
these cell lines with amplified NPM-ALK not only were TKI resistant but also showed TKI

dependency. Interestingly, in the presence of 40nM brigatinib, NPM-ALK phosphorylation
levels and downstream signaling, including ERK1/2 phosphorylation, were comparable to
parental cell lines (Fig. 6B and D). Remarkably, upon drug withdrawal the cytoplasmic
fraction of NPM-ALK in ALK amplified cell lines became highly phosphorylated, caused
hyper-activation of ERK1/2 and led to oncogenic stress through phosphorylation of H2AX,
in keeping with the data in ALK-rearranged ALCL cell lines overexpressing NPM-ALK
(Fig. 6B and 6D). As a consequence apoptosis was induced dramatically after 72h of drug
suspension (Fig. 6E). The same effect was observed in another ALK-rearranged cell line
resistant to the ALK inhibitor ASP3026, SUPM2R1. We recently demonstrated that in this
cell line TKI resistance was mediated by both ALK amplification and an ALK point
mutation 25. Also in this cell line, TKI withdrawal was followed by increased cell death
(Supplementary Fig. 10). Overall these data indicate that in NPM-ALK amplified resistant
ALCL cells the increased expression of NPM-ALK fusion results in accumulation of
cytoplasmic NPM-ALK. In this condition, the excess ALK signaling is partially abrogated
by low doses of ALK TKI resulting in ALK phosphorylation and ERK1/2 signaling
comparable to the parental cells. However, upon ALK TKI suspension, the excess NPMALK signaling secondary to the ALK amplification induces an oncogenic stress response
with DNA damage and apoptosis.
Long-term suspension of ALK TKI selects cells with restored sensitivity

Author Manuscript

Based on these results, we envisioned a therapeutic approach to overcome resistance
mediated by ALK amplification in ALCL. We grew parental KARPAS 299 and resistant
cells in the presence or in the absence of brigatinib for five weeks. As expected, parental
KARPAS 299 did not grow in presence of the drug (Fig. 7A, left-top panel). Of the three
resistant cell lines, K299AR300B never grew in absence of the TKI, possibly consistent with
their higher apoptosis and DNA damage response (Fig. 7A, left-bottom and Fig. 6D-E). In
contrast, K299AR300A and K299AR300C, after an initial apoptotic response, recovered in
absence of the TKI (Fig7A. right panels). Remarkably, sensitivity to brigatinib was restored
in these cells that recovered after TKI suspension (K299AR300A- and K299AR300C-; Fig.
7B-C). IC50 values for brigatinib of K299AR300A- and K299AR300C- were similar to the
original for parental cells (6 and 7nM versus 3nM, Fig. 7C). Interestingly, in these cells,
NPM-ALK overexpression was lost as its expression levels were again similar to the
parental cell line (Fig. 7D). These results are in accordance with recent data reported by
Amin et al on regression in mice of NPM-ALK amplified ALCL xenografts upon TKI
treatment suspension 28. These results suggest that ALK TKI resistance mediated by ALK
amplification could be tamed by cycles of drug suspension, a so-called “drug holiday” where
ALK amplified cells would die under an oncogenic stress-mediated DNA damage.

DISCUSSION
In the present work we demonstrated that the amount of cytoplasmic NPM-ALK in ALCL is
critical for optimal lymphoma growth and survival. We showed that only half of the total
NPM-ALK in ALCL is active in the cytoplasm in the form of homodimers, whereas WT
NPM1 sequesters the other half in the form of inactive heterodimers. Therefore in NPMALK rearranged ALCL a critical stoichiometric equilibrium is reached between WT NPM1

and oncogenic NPM-ALK, and a perturbation of such equilibrium in either directions results
in diminished cell growth and viability. A decrease of NPM-ALK expression or activity
results in lymphoma cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as it has now been demonstrated in
preclinical models and in clinical trials with ALK TKI19, 42-44. In the present study we
demonstrate that also an excess of NPM-ALK signaling is detrimental to ALCL growth by
triggering an oncogene-induced stress response and apoptosis, and that nuclear sequestration
of NPM-ALK is essential to maintain the optimal levels and to prevent an excess of ALK
signaling (Fig. 8).

Author Manuscript

Oncogenes trigger growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic signals for malignant
transformation and outgrowth, but under certain conditions they can also initiate cellular
programs that lead to apoptosis or senescence36. This phenomenon known as oncogenic
stress is a common response to a cell replicative stress and DNA damage induced by the
enforced proliferation caused by the deregulated oncogenic activity. Oncogenes activate an
ATR/ATM-regulated DNA damage response network that delays or prevents cancer
progression in early phase until this checkpoint is compromised by genetic alterations that
often result in modification of the ATM-Chk2-p53 pathway36, 38. In ALCL, the p53 pathway
is rarely inactivated by mutations45, but it has been suggested that its activity is partially
inactivated in an MDM2 and JNK-dependent manner46. Our data show that ALCL are still
susceptible to apoptosis induced by an oncogenic stress generated by an excess of NPMALK signaling. When NPM-ALK was overexpressed or redirected to the cytoplasm after
elimination of the nuclear sequestration by NPM1 knock-out, a DNA damage response was
readily demonstrated by phosphorylation of Chk2 and formation of γH2AX and 53BP1
nuclear foci. Similarly to other oncogenes, the NPM-ALK oncogenic stress response was
mediated by hyperactivation of MEK/ERK1/2 signaling36, 47, 48.

Author Manuscript

In the present work we also asked whether these findings could be exploited for therapeutic
purposes. Exciting advancements in the therapy of ALCL are seemingly at hand after the
development of ALK TKI. Our group was the first to show that the first generation ALK
TKI crizotinib is potently active in ALCL patients relapsed after standard cytotoxic
therapy19, 43. However, a fraction of patients relapse under therapy for the development of
resistance to ALK TKI.

Author Manuscript

Studies in few patients so far confirmed that mechanisms of resistance in ALCL are similar
to those that occur in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Most cases of resistance are mediated by
point mutations in the ALK tyrosine kinase domain that affect the binding of the ALK
TKI19, 24, 27. As an alternative mechanism, we recently demonstrated that resistance to the
ALK TKI brigatinib can also originate from amplification of the NPM-ALK gene so that an
increased amount of NPM-ALK is produced by the resistant cells26. In these amplified
ALCL cells, the stoichiometric balance between NPM-ALK and WT NPM1 is altered by an
excess of NPM-ALK expression due to gene amplification. In these conditions, we
demonstrated that releasing ALK inhibition by brigatinib suspension induces a rebound
excess of ALK signaling identical to ALCL where NPM-ALK is overexpressed. This
signaling includes hyperphosphorylation of ERK1/2 and −H2AX and results in cell
apoptosis. Long-term culture of resistant KARPAS 299 cells in the absence of the ALK TKI
resulted in the selection and outgrowth of cells that showed restored sensitivity to brigatinib.

In those cell lines NPM-ALK overexpression was abrogated, consistently with data shown.
Thus, in line with other cases of resistance, such as B-Raf, BCR-ABL, and others31-34, 49,
our data suggest that patients that have developed resistance to ALK TKI mediated by NPMALK amplification might benefit from cycles of administration and suspension of TKI
treatment, the so called “drug holiday” therapy (Fig.8) 50, 51. Recently, a drug holiday
approach for NPM-ALK amplified ALCL was also proposed by Amin et al. with
experiments in xenograft mouse models28.

Author Manuscript

A second possible therapeutic application of our findings would involve the use of drugs that
alter the nuclear import-export, thereby creating an unbalance between the amounts of
nuclear and cytoplasmic NPM-ALK. In the case of NPM-ALK accumulation in the
cytoplasm an oncogenic stress response would be activated. In contrast, should NPM-ALK
nuclear sequestration increase, the active cytoplasmic fraction would decrease. In either
cases cell viability would be affected as we showed in this study. To test this hypothesis, in
preliminary experiments we tested the nuclear export inhibitor KPT330 on ALCL cells.
KPT330 is currently in clinical trial for the treatment of acute leukemia 8, 52. Treatment with
KPT330 resulted in a marked apoptosis of ALCL cells (Supplementary Fig. 11A).
Remarkably, KTP330 synergized with crizotinib in the induction of apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. 11B-E). Increased sensitivity to crizotinib suggests that KPT330 might
decrease the amount of active cytoplasmic NPM-ALK by impeding the nuclear export. More
detailed studies on this combination therapy are currently under way in our laboratory.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, our findings establish a novel concept of a critical balance of NPM-ALK
signaling in ALCL cells. Exploiting the unbalance created by NPM-ALK amplification in
TKI resistant ALCL by a period “drug holiday’ could represent an additional therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of ALK-rearranged ALCL.

NPM-ALK constructs, virus preparation, cell infection and cell sorting

Author Manuscript

Pallino vector expressing NPM-ALK or NPM-ALKK210R were previously described53.
NPMtot-ALK construct was generated by PCR. The PCR product was cloned into PCRII
vector using the T/A cloning technology (Invitrogen) and then cloned into pallino retroviral
vector at HINDIII/XhoI sites.
For the TetON system, NPM-ALK and NPM-ALKK210R were cloned into a modified pCCL
vector containing the coding sequence of the EGFP-1 and the inducible bidirectional PBI-1
promoter that co-express the cloned gene and EGFP-1, as reporter.
Lentiviral shRNA clones targeting NPM were obtained from Sigma.

Author Manuscript

Retroviruses and lentiviruses were generated and cells were infected as previously
described53.
For the lentiviral-mediated inducible gene expression, cells were co-infected with pCCL
lentiviruses and the rtTA regulator plasmid, according to the TetON strategy54.
For cell sorting enrichment, cells were induced with 1ug/ml doxycycline hyciclate for 12h
and sorted for GFP expression on a MoFlo High-Performance Cell Sorter (DAKO
Cytomation). Cells were analyzed for GFP content on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson) and the CELLQuest (tm) software (BD) was used for the data
acquisition and analysis.
Cell apoptosis, caspase, proliferation and soft-agar assays

Author Manuscript

Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry after staining with 200nM tetrametylrodamine
methyl-ester (TMRM) or with annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit (BD
Biosciences), as previously described53. For caspase assay, the activity of caspase-3 and -7
was measured using Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay (Promega) and the multi-detection system
Glomax (Promega). Proliferation and soft-agar assays were performed as previously
described24. Each experiment was repeated two or three times, see figure legends.
Protein subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting
Cells were processed for the cytoplasm-nuclear fractionation by sequential step of lysis
following NE-PER kit (Thermo Scientific) protocol. Total cell lysates were extracted as
previoulsy described53. Each experiment was repeated three times.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence stainings were performed as previously
described53. Coverslips were viewed using a Leica TCS SP2 laser-scanning confocal
microscope driven by the Leica Confocal Software; the images were acquired at room
temperature, by means of a 63X PL APO objective, numerical aperture 1.32. Brightfield
images were acquired on a Leica DM IRE2 microscope using a DC300F camera and
analyzed with the IM 50 software.

FISH analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

FISH analysis on K299AR300A, AR300B and AR300C cell lines was previously
described26. Amplified NPM-ALK quantification was performed using the Metafer Slide
Scanning System (MetaSystems Hard & Software GmbH). The image acquisition and the
analysis of the cells were performed automatically by using the Metafer Slide Scanning
System (MetaSystems Hard & Software GmbH), connected to the motorized microscope
ZEISS Axio Imager.Z2 (Carl Zeiss). 3-channels images of a predefined area of the samples
were acquired at a magnification of 40x. A “Z-stack” acquisition mode was used for the Red
and Aqua channels, in order to provide a tridimensional evaluation of the corresponding
FISH signals. The Red and Aqua FISH signals that resided inside the DAPI counterstain
contour of the selected cells were identified and counted by a sophisticated spot-counting
algorithm (based on Horn-Schunck algorithm). The ratio between the Red and Aqua values
was calculated for every cell, and a medium overall ratio for all the analyzed cells was then
calculated and graphically reported by the software.
In vivo tumor challenge
NOD-SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories Italia S.p.A) were inoculated s.c (N= 4 ctrl
and N=4 treated) and measured as previously described55. Mice were handled and treated in
accordance with European Community guidelines.
Statistical Analysis
Dose–response curves were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. IC50 indicates the
concentration of inhibitor that gives half-maximal inhibition. Statistical significance was
calculated with two-sided T-Student test. P values of <0.05 were considered significant.
Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as means ± sd.

Figure 1. In ALCL cells NPM-ALK is equally distributed between the cytoplasm and the
nucleus, but it is phosphorylated only in the cytoplasm

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A) ALK-rearranged ALCL cells were collected and total cell lysates were processed for the
cytoplasm-nuclear fractionation. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were blotted with the
indicated antibodies. B) Immunohistochemistry on ALCL tissue samples with anti-ALK or
anti-pALK(Y1604) antibody (top panels). Immunofluorescence staining with anti-ALK or
anti-pALK(Y1604) antibody in TS cells (red fluorescence) (bottom panels). C) NPM-ALK
constructs. The different constructs were cloned in a retroviral vector, pallino, with the
reporter gene GFP. NPM-ALK fusion protein and the kinase dead mutant (K210R) NPMALKKD are indicated. The translocated counterpart of NPM contains the oligomerization
domain (OD) at the N-terminal, but it looses the nuclear (NLS) and nucleolar localization
signals (NuLS) at the C-terminal, as indicated. NPMtot-ALK construct was created by PCR
amplification in order to force NPM-ALK expression in the nucleus. In this construct the
entire NPM coding sequence is fused to the C-terminal of ALK. D) Human 293T cells were
transfected with the indicated DNA constructs and harvested after 24h.
Immunohistochemistry with a specific anti-ALK antibody was performed on formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded cells (D). E-F) NPMtot-ALK does not transform cells. NIH3T3 cells
were infected with pallino-NPM-ALK, NPM-ALKKD or NPMtot-ALK. Total cell lysates
were blotted with the indicated antibodies (E). NIH3T3 cells infected with the indicated
constructs were plated in soft agar and cultured for 3 weeks. Histograms represent the
average numbers of colonies grown in soft agar (F). Data are from one of three independent
experiments. G-H) Nuclear NPMtot-ALK does not support a cytokine independent growth.
IL-3 dependent Ba/F3 cells were stably transfected with NPM-ALK, NPM-ALKKD or
NPMtot-ALK. Ba/F3 cells were collected in presence of IL-3 and blotted with the indicated
antibodies (G). Three days after infection Ba/F3 cells were grown in absence of IL-3 and the
percentage of viable cells was checked by FACS analysis at the indicated time points (H)
Data are from one of two independent experiments. Statistical significance was calculated by
Student’s t-test where ***P <0.0005.

NPM−/−/p53−/− MEF and p53−/− MEF cells were infected with pallino-NPM-ALK, NPMALKKD or NPMtot-ALK retrovirus. The percentage of GFP+ cells was checked by FACS
analysis. A) Immunofluorescence staining with a specific anti-ALK antibody or antipALK(Y1604) was performed (red fluorescence). Green fluorescence is the EGFP reporter
protein encoded by transduced cells. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Images were taken
with the Leica Confocal microscope. B) Cells were collected and processed for the
cytoplasm-nuclear fractionation. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were blotted with the
indicated antibodies. C-D) The percentage of apoptosis in NPM−/−/p53−/− MEF and p53−/−
MEF cells was measured by TMRM staining and FACS analysis (C). The activation of the
caspase 3/7 was analysed using Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay (Promega) and the Glomax multidetection system (D). Data are from three independent experiments. Statistical significance
was calculated by Student’s t-test where **P <0.005; ****P <0.0001.

A) ALK-rearranged ALCL cells (SU-DHL-1 and COST) were infected with a doxycyclineinducible lentivirus espressing NPM-ALK or the kinase dead, NPM-ALKKD. The
percentage of GFP+ cells was checked by FACS analysis. Cells were cultured in absence/
presence of doxycycline (1μg/ml) for 24h to induce the expression of the indicated
constructs and total cell lysates were collected for Western blot analysis with the indicated
antibodies. B) SU-DHL-1 and COST inducible cell lines were collected and processed for
the cytoplasm-nuclear fractionation. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were blotted with the
indicated antibodies. C-F) Cells were cultured in presence/absence of doxycycline for 48h.
Cell death was analysed by TMRM staining and FACS analysis (C-D) and caspase 3/7
activation was analysed using Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay (Promega) and the Glomax multidetection system . Data are from one of three independent experiments. G-H) NOD-SCID
mice were inoculated s.c in both flanks with 106 ALK-rearranged ALCL inducible cell lines
(SU-DHL-1 and COST). Tumor growth was measured at the indicated time points.
Statistical significance was calculated by Student’s t-test where *P <0.05; **P <0.005;
****P <0.0001.

SU-DHL-1 and COST were infected with a doxycycline-inducible lentivirus expressing
NPM-ALK or NPM-ALKKD and grown in presence of doxycycline (1μg/ml). A)
Immunofluorescence staining with a specific anti-γH2AX (S139) antibody (red
fluorescence) was performed. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Green fluorescence is the
EGFP reporter protein encoded by the retrovirally transduced cells. B-C) Histograms
represent the % of γH2AX positive microfoci in SU-DHL-1 (B) and COST (C) at 48h from
induction with doxycycline. D) Cells were induced with doxycycline, harvested at the
indicated time points and blotted with the indicated antibodies. E) SU-DHL-1 and COST
inducible cell lines (NPM-ALK and NPM-ALKKD) were grown in presence of doxycycline
for 48h and treated with the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 (1μM) for 24h. Total cell lysates were
immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Data are from one out of three independent
experiments. Statistical significance was calculated by Student’s t-test where **P <0.05;
****P<0.0001.

Resistant cell lines K299AR300A, K299AR300B and K299AR300C were obtained as
reported in Methods. A) Quantification of NPM-ALK genomic amplification was performed
by using the Metafer Slide Scanning System. Values are normalized on the probe specific for
centromere of chromosome 2. B) KARPAS 299 TetOn were induced with doxycycline for
48h and collected for the cytoplasm-nuclear fractionation. K299AR300A, K299AR300B
and K299AR300C were collected after 48h of brigatinib suspension and processed for the
cytoplasm-nuclear fractionation. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were blotted with the
indicated antibodies. C) A dose-response curve in the presence of brigatinib was performed
on K299AR300A, K299AR300B and K299AR300C cell lines. Cells were incubated for
three days in the presence of the indicated brigatinib concentration, then they were incubated
for 8 hours with 3H-radiolabeled thymidine. Radioactive incorporation was evaluated and
normalized on the untreated wells. D) Cells were plated in absence or in presence of 40nM
brigatinib for 24 or 48 hours then harvested and blotted with the indicated antibodies. E)
Cells were incubated for 72 hours with or w/o brigatinib [40nM]. Apoptosis was evaluated
by annexinV-PI staining. Histograms represent the percentage of apoptotic (annV+, PI+)
cells for each analysed cell population. Data are from one out of three independent
experiments. Statistical significance was calculated by Student’s t-test where **P <0.005.
