Abstract
Epimorphin/syntaxin-2 is a membrane-tethered protein localized extracellularly (Epim) and intracellularly
(Stx-2). The extracellular form Epim stimulates morphogenic processes in a range of tissues, including in murine
mammary glands where its overexpression in luminal epithelial cells is sufﬁcient to drive hyperplasia and
neoplasia. We analyzed WAP-Epim transgenic mice to gain insight into how Epim promotes malignancy. Ectopic
overexpression of Epim during postnatal mammary gland development led to early side-branching onset,
precocious bud formation, and increased proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Conversely, peptide-based
inhibition of Epim function reduced side branching. Because increased side branching and hyperplasia occurs
similarly in mice upon overexpression of the progesterone receptor isoform-a (Pgr-a), we investigated whether
Epim exhibits these phenotypes through Pgr modulation. Epim overexpression indeed led to a steep upregulation
of both total Pgr mRNA and Pgr-a protein levels. Notably, the Pgr antagonist RU486 abrogated Epim-induced
ductal side branching, mammary epithelial cell proliferation, and bud formation. Evaluation of Epim signaling in a
three-dimensional ex vivo culture system showed that its action was dependent on binding to its extracellular
receptor, integrin-aV, and on matrix metalloproteinase 3 activity downstream of Pgr-a. These ﬁndings elucidate a
hitherto unknown transcriptional regulator of Pgr-a, and shed light on how overexpression of Epim leads to
malignancy. Cancer Res; 73(18); 5719–29. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The mouse mammary gland is a reticulum of branching
tubules and alveolar structures that undergoes most of its
development postnatally. Stages of development involve
branching morphogenesis that commences at puberty, functional differentiation in pregnancy and lactation, and involution of alveolar structures after weaning. These stages are
reproduced during estrous cycles albeit to a less dramatic
extent. Endocrine hormones such as 17b-estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and glucocorticoids are essential for normal
mammary gland development (reviewed in ref. 1). Genetic
ablation of the receptors for 17b-estradiol and progesterone,
Esr1 and Pgr, in mice, revealed that Esr1 is required for ductal
elongation whereas Pgr is critical for alveologenesis to ensue
(reviewed in ref. 2). Through Esr1 and Pgr activation, signals for

mammary gland development are propagated by upregulation
of transcription factors and release of local factors. Examples of
local factors include EGF and keratinocyte growth factor for
Esr1 (reviewed in ref. 3), and receptor activated NF-kB ligand
(RANKL) for Pgr (4), and Esr1 is a primary transcriptional
regulator of Pgr in the mammary gland (5). Here, we have made
the surprising discovery that Pgr expression is also regulated
transcriptionally by the local mammary morphogen, Epim.
Epim was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a surface mesenchymal protein
that was crucial for dermal and lung epithelial cell morphogenesis (6). Subsequently, Epim was rediscovered as a member
of a family of integral membrane proteins renamed syntaxins
(7) that were shown to have important intracellular functions
in membrane fusion and exocytosis (reviewed in ref. 8).
However, because of the distinct extracellular function of
Epim, which was discovered before the syntaxin nomenclature
and function, we continue to refer to the extracellular form as
Epim and the intracellular function as Stx-2 (9, 10). Epim has
been shown to regulate morphogenesis in a range of tissues
including bile duct, intestinal crypts, hair follicle, skin, pancreas, gall bladder, testes, and lung, as well as in the mammary
gland (reviewed in ref. 10). Epim is expressed in the mouse
mammary gland by ﬁbroblasts and myoepithelial cells in
virgin mice (11), and additionally in luminal epithelial cells in
pregnant and lactating mice (unpublished data). In threedimensional (3D) collagen gel assays, we showed that Epimstimulated mammary epithelial cell branching and lumen
formation (11–13), and that these Epim functions were dependent upon binding to its cell surface receptor, integrin-aV (13).

WAP-Epim transgenic mice (14) develop thickened mammary
ducts, upregulate the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer
binding protein b (Cebpb) in pregnancy, and develop hyperplasia and neoplasia at approximately 18-months after birth
(15).
To determine why WAP-Epim mice are prone to mammary
hyperplasia and neoplasia after 1 year of birth, we asked
whether these mice exhibit histologic stages of cancer progression even earlier in life. We hypothesized that by analyzing
young mice we could identify which molecular pathways
become deregulated during this progression. We found that
these mice develop also extensive lateral branches in nulliparous mice (week 8) and precocious alveolar structures in
young pregnant mice (week 12) and increased mammary
epithelial cell proliferation during alveologenesis. These phenotypes resembled those described for Pgr-a transgenic mice
(16). In addition, WAP-Epim mice develop hyperplasia similar
to Pgr-a transgenic mice. Because of the similarities between
Epim and Pgr-a transgenic mice (15–18) and the fact that both
Epim and Pgr upregulate Cebpb (14, 19, 20), we reasoned that
there was a connection between the 2 molecules.
Interrogation of a downstream mechanism in both WAPEpim transgenic mice and the ex vivo 3D assays showed that
Epim indeed regulates Pgr-a, and that Epim controls Pgrinduced side branching, bud formation, and epithelial cell
proliferation. We show also that Epim regulation of Pgr-a
expression occurs through activation of integrin-aV. Furthermore, we show that Epim-induced proliferation and bud
formation, which we showed previously to correlate with
Mmp3 expression, occurs downstream of Pgr.

Materials and Methods
Transgenic mice
The generation of hemizygous WAP-Epim mice (abbreviated further as TG in ﬁgures), in which Epim is tagged with the
mouse IL-2 signal peptide sequence and expressed under
control of the whey acidic protein promoter, has been
described previously (14). Transgene-negative littermates were
used as controls. Animal use protocols were obtained and
procedures were followed in strict accordance with guidelines
established by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Animal Welfare and Research Committee (AWRC).
Staging of developmental time points
Nulliparous mice were analyzed at 1.5, 8, and 14 weeks after
birth. For analysis of alveolar development, tissue was collected from pregnant wild-type and WAP-Epim animals at day 12
of pregnancy. To stage pregnancy, breeding mice were checked
in the morning for vaginal plugs. If plugs were found, the female
was separated from the male and this day was designated day 0
of pregnancy. For analysis of lactation, dams were allowed to
nurse 6 pups to equalize suckling, tissue was collected on day
10 subsequent to parturition.
Tissue collection and whole mounts
At the time of dissection, the stage of estrous was determined by vaginal lavage followed by cytological analysis. For
each study, the thoracic and inguinal mammary glands were

5720

Cancer Res; 73(18) September 15, 2013

excised and frozen immediately on dry ice for RNA and protein
isolation or they were formalin ﬁxed for histologic analysis.
One inguinal gland was ﬁxed in Carnoy's solution overnight
then stained with carmine alum to analyze ductal/alveolar
morphology.
Genotyping, reverse transcriptase, and PCR
For genotyping, tail DNA was digested overnight in 50 mL
proteinase K buffer, diluted 8, and used as template for PCR
reaction. The expression of the Epim transgene was conﬁrmed
by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. For analysis of gene expression in mouse mammary glands, total RNA was extracted from
frozen mammary glands using TRIzol (Invitrogen) or from
mammary organoids using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) then reverse
transcribed using Superscript II First Strand Synthesis System
(Invitrogen). qPCR was conducted using a LightCycler (Roche
Diagnostics). Primers used in qPCR reactions are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
Histologic analysis
Histomorphometry to compare differences in epithelial
density was conducted using a Mertz graticule on hematoxylin
and eosin-stained 5 mm mammary gland parafﬁn sections
generated by the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive
Cancer Center Mouse Pathology Core. Five successive ﬁelds
were examined for each mammary gland. The criteria included
the presence or absence of epithelial structures or adipocytes.
To quantify side branching, the 3 longest ducts were analyzed
on each mammary gland whole mount beginning from the
lymph node. The number of side branches was divided by the
length to yield side branches/branch length.
Protein isolation
From each animal, thoracic mammary glands were homogenized in 500 mL lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.6), 5 mmol/L
EDTA, 50 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton-X] with 1 proteinase
inhibitor cocktail I (CalBiochem, Merck KGaA) for immunoblotting. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000  g for
20 minutes at 4 C, supernatant was isolated and stored at
70 C until needed. Protein was isolated from organoids as
previously described (21). Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad
Laboratories Inc.).
Western analysis
For Western analysis, 10 mg protein lysate was added to
loading buffer (250 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 20%
b-mercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol), boiled for 5 minutes, and
electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). After
transferring onto nitrocellulose membranes 0.45 mm (Bio-Rad
Laboratories Inc.), total blotted protein was visualized by
PonceauS staining. Blots were blocked overnight at 4 C using
5% nonfat dry milk in 1 Tris-buffered saline. Antibodies
against b-casein, generated from hybridoma cells in the Bissell
Lab used at a 1/10,000 dilution to test functional differentiation
(22), the b-catenin mouse monoclonal antibody was from
Sigma (C-7207), the Pgr antibody (Ab-8; Neomarkers), and
lamin A/C (Lmna) and estrogen receptor antibodies were from

Epimorphin Drives Expression of Progesterone Receptor-A

Santa Cruz Biotechnology (H-110 and MC-20). Secondary
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated antimouse and
anti-rabbit antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences (GE
Healthcare). Dilutions followed manufacturers' suggestion.
Detection of HRP signal was achieved using Thermoscientiﬁc
Supersignal West Dura with a FluorChem 8900 chemical
imager (Alpha Innotech, Cell Biosciences).
Immunostaining on mammary sections
Mammary sections (5 mm) were deparafﬁnized and rehydrated in graded alcohol to 1 PBS, then blocked for 10
minutes in 3% H2O2 in 70% ethanol, followed by antigen
retrieval for 10 minutes in sodium citrate buffer (10 mmol/L
sodium citrate, pH 6.0) using a microwave. Slides were incubated overnight in a humidiﬁed chamber with anti-Epim 1/50
dilution (MC-1 antibody, gift from Y. Hirai), anti-Cebpb at a
1/100 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin D1
(Ccnd1) at a 1/100 dilution (Thermoscientiﬁc), and anti-Pgr
at a 1/50 dilution (DAKO) then washed in 1 PBS and
incubated for 1-hour with biotinylated secondary antibodies.
Avidin:biotinylated enzyme complex (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) was used to amplify signal, followed by visualization
using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine color substrate (Sigma).
Statistical analysis
To determine statistical signiﬁcance, two-tailed paired T
tests were used when treatments were to organoids or tissue
from the same animal. For comparing differences in expression
or morphology between various mice, two-tailed Mann–Whitney tests were used. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant. All error bars represent SEM measurements.

Results
Epim controls the level of side branching in the
nulliparous mouse mammary gland
We reported previously that WAP-Epim transgenic mice
develop alveolar hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma with high
incidence when they age to approximately 18 months; however,
we did not know the molecular mechanism by which Epim
overexpression could cause mammary tumors. To determine
the mechanism(s) leading to malignancy, we investigated
whether there were consequences to mammary gland development when Epim signaling becomes deregulated. To inhibit
Epim, we used Pep7, a 10-amino acid peptide initially discovered to be the minimal portion of the H1 domain of Epim
capable of inducing a telogen-to-anagen transition in mouse
hair follicle morphogenesis (23), and that was found also to
inhibit Eph4 mammary epithelial cell branching in collagen
gels (24). We injected pep7, or a control scrambled peptide, into
the contra-lateral mammary glands of wild-type mice and
observed a signiﬁcant decrease in side branching in pep7injected mammary glands as compared with glands injected
with control peptide (Fig. 1A and B). We did not, however,
observe any difference in ductal length between pep7-treated
mammary glands and contralateral scramble peptide-treated
glands (not shown). Pgr is necessary also for side- branching
but not ductal length in the mouse mammary gland (25). That
we observed a decrease in side branching but not ductal length

when using the Epim inhibitor suggested that Pgr might be
involved. Thus, we proceeded to analyze young WAP-Epim
transgenic mice to determine whether there are similar defects
in ductal development as in Pgr transgenic mice.
Although the promoter of the WAP gene is activated most
strongly from day 10 of pregnancy through lactation, with
residual activity during involution (26), WAP is expressed also
in nulliparous mice (27) and we observed upregulated Epim in
the mammary epithelial cells of nulliparous WAP-Epim mice
(Fig. 1C), associated with an increased ratio of epithelial cells
(E) compared with adipocytes (A) as compared with the wild
type (80% increased; Fig. 1D). To evaluate how overexpression of Epim-affected ductal outgrowth, mammary glands were
isolated before, during, and after peak ductal outgrowth at 1.5,
8, and 14 weeks. At 1.5 weeks, WAP-Epim mammary glands
were indistinguishable from wild type in terms of ductal length
and the number of primary branches (n ¼ 10, not shown). To
control for hormonal differences between cycling 8- and 14week-old wild-type and transgenic (TG) mice, they were compared only in the same estrous stage. By 8 weeks of age,
mammary glands from WAP-Epim mice showed 80% more
side branches than the wild type (Fig. 1E and F). In contrast,
there were no statistical differences in ductal length (Fig. S1A).
By 14 weeks, the wild-type mammary gland had caught up in
the number of side branches compared with the WAP-Epim
mouse (n ¼ 11 wild type, n ¼ 19 TG, not shown).
As a further control for the speciﬁcity of Epim action to
induce side branching, we compared the effect of a recombinant soluble Epim with that of an engineered protein that is
82% homologous to Epim (rStx1a), but that does not activate
Epim responses in culture (28). Using the same mouse, we
injected rEpim peptide to one inguinal mammary gland and
rStx1a peptide to the contralateral mammary gland. Whereas
there were no signiﬁcant differences in number of side
branches or ductal length between the right and left inguinal
mammary glands injected with PBS alone (not shown), the
rEpim injected mammary gland showed a signiﬁcant increase
in side branches compared with the rStx1a treated contralateral side in the same mouse (Fig. 1G). Again, we did not observe
a difference in ductal length as was the case also between WAPEpim and wild-type mice, and the case between pep7 and
mammary glands treated with scrambled peptides. Thus,
attenuating Epim signaling early in ductal development hinders the elaboration of secondary branches, whereas overexpression of Epim stimulates precocious side branching
without affecting ductal length. These phenotypes resemble
both the defect in side branching in the Pgr knockout mice
(25, 29) and the supernumerary side branching and hyperplasia
in the Pgr-a transgenic mice (16).
Epim overexpression stimulates precocious
alveologenesis through upregulation of Pgr in pregnancy
Administration of 17-b estradiol and progesterone to mice
where both Pgr isoforms were ablated showed that Pgr is
necessary for alveolar differentiation in the mouse mammary
gland (25). Given that WAP-Epim mice also show increased
side branching, ductal ectasia, and hyperplasia similar to the
Pgr-a transgenic mice (16, 17), we hypothesized that the action

of Pgr to induce alveologenesis during pregnancy could be
regulated also by Epim. Whole mounts and histologic sections
of wild-type and WAP-Epim mammary glands showed a dramatic increase in the number of alveolar structures at day 12 of
pregnancy compared with wild type (Fig. 2A and B), a time
point at which Epim was highly overexpressed in the WAPEpim mammary gland (Fig. 2C). WAP-Epim mammary glands
displayed larger, more abundant alveoli with larger lumena,
increased lipid droplets (Fig. 2B, arrow) and elevated b-casein
expression (not shown) compared with wild type. We reported
previously that mammary glands from pregnant WAP-Epim
mice developed enlarged mammary ducts (14), a phenotype
observed also in the Pgr-a transgenic mice (16).
Esr1 is a well-known positive regulator of Pgr expression in
the mammary gland (30). Therefore, we assessed whether Epim
regulates Esr1 in the mouse mammary gland during midpregnancy (day 12 of gestation). We did not detect signiﬁcant

5722

differences in Esr1 mRNA by qPCR (Fig. 2D). However, Pgr
mRNA (Fig. 2E) and protein levels (Fig. 2F and G) were
signiﬁcantly elevated in the TG mice compared with wild type.
Using a polyclonal antibody that detects both isoforms, we
showed that Epim predominately regulates Pgr-a (Fig. 3F and
G; band at 80 kDa for Pgr-a is compared with one at 110 kDa
corresponding to Pgr-b), indicating that Epim regulates primarily Pgr-a. Therefore, the effects of Epim on ductal elongation and alveolar differentiation are consistent with the distinct effects of Esr1 and Pgr on these processes and the
differential expression of Esr1 and Pgr-a in the WAP-Epim
transgenic mouse mammary glands.

Epimorphin Drives Expression of Progesterone Receptor-A

Epim stimulates MEC proliferation through Pgr
upregulation
Analysis of signaling cascades in vivo is complicated by the
rapid development of the mammary gland, and the constantly
changing composition of hormones and growth factors. To
study these interactions in a more controlled microenvironment and to deﬁne further cellular mechanisms underlying
Epim-driven precocious alveologenesis in the WAP-Epim
mouse, we used an ex vivo assay established in our laboratory
(21). We used fragments of mammary epithelium (organoids)
generated from 8-week-old mice in 3D Lr-ECM. In this assay,
addition of a growth factor, such as TGF-a, initiates alveolar
bud-like morphogenesis. When the epithelial fragment is
embedded into Lr-ECM, it forms a simple bilayered cyst with
a hollow lumen. A growth factor such as TGF-a or ﬁbroblast
growth factor-2 stimulates epithelial cell proliferation and
lumen ﬁlling, expansion of the multi-cell-layered cysts, and
eventually budding and ductal extension (31). Cell proliferation
was shown to be required early in the process of cyst formation,
approximately a day after growth factor treatment (21).
We conﬁrmed that the Epim transgene was expressed in
organoids embedded in Lr-ECM (Supplementary Fig. S2A). At

by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3A and C). In addition, Pgr
expression was less heterogeneous compared with wild type,
often showing clustered expression along mammary ducts
(Fig. 3A; WAP-Epim, arrow). We observed also upregulation
of 2 Pgr-responsive genes (19): CCAAT enhancer binding
protein b (Cebpb; not shown) and Cyclin D1 (Ccnd1; Fig. 3B
and D). Ccnd1 has been shown to be involved in the ﬁrst
wave of proliferation induced by progesterone in Pgr positive luminal epithelial cells (4). To test whether Pgr expression is required for stimulation of side branching in the
WAP-Epim mice, 6-week-old mice were injected subcutaneously with the Pgr antagonist RU486 or oil control every
other day for 8 days. By whole mount analysis, the RU486treated mice showed approximately 70% fewer side branches
than controls (Fig. 3E). We conclude that the effects of Pgr
effects on side branching in the mammary gland may be
related to Epim regulation of Pgr-a.

the time of organoid isolation and embedding into Lr-ECM,
there was a nonsigniﬁcant size difference between wild-type
and WAP-Epim organoids (Supplementary Fig. S2E). However,
1 day after embedding into Lr-ECM, WAP-Epim organoids or
wild-type organoids treated with rEpim formed larger cysts
than wild-type or BSA controls, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. S2D and S2F), indicating that Epim-TG mammary organoids grew at a faster rate than wild type. This observation was
made before the organoids were treated with TGF-a, the
growth factor that is added to initiate branching. Labeling
organoids with 5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine (EdU) to detect cells

in S-phase showed that WAP-Epim organoids, on average,
contained 2.8-fold greater number of EdU positive epithelial
cells compared with wild type in Lr-ECM on the ﬁrst day after
embedding into Lr-ECM (Fig. 4A and B).
Pgr regulates alveologenesis in the mouse mammary gland
(25) and we had found that Pgr activity was elevated in Epiminduced side branching (Fig. 2E and G). As Pgr also stimulates
MEC proliferation (4, 32), we asked whether Epim stimulates
MEC proliferation through Pgr. We observed an increase in
total Pgr expression in the WAP-Epim organoids in Lr-ECM
compared with wild type (Supplementary Fig. S2B) as observed

also in vivo. We also observed a trend for upregulation of Pgr in
wild-type organoids treated with rEpim (Supplementary Fig.
S2C and S2G), suggesting that this regulation occurs without
the requirement of the WAP promoter. To test whether Epim
controls MEC proliferation through Pgr, we treated wild-type
and WAP-Epim mammary glands in Lr-ECM with RU486 and
found that this treatment abrogated the increased proliferation in WAP-Epim organoids (Fig. 4A and B). In addition, we
found that increased bud formation in WAP-Epim organoids
was blocked also by RU486 (Fig. 4C and D), implicating
an Epim-Pgr signaling axis in both proliferation and bud
formation.

Epim was shown previously to induce MEC branching in a
3D collagen gel culture assay through upregulation of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP; ref. 12), and to increase hepatocellular carcinoma invasion and metastasis through activation of
MMP9 (33). Here, we found also that WAP-Epim mice upregulate MMP3 and MMP9 (Fig. 5A and B). We hypothesized that
MMP activity is required for increased proliferation and bud
formation in mammary glands of WAP-Epim mice. To test this,
we used the broad spectrum chemical inhibitor of MMP
activity, GM6001, and found this indeed to be true (Fig. 5C–
E). We also tested whether Pgr activity regulates MMPs in this
context by treating wild-type and WAP-Epim organoids with

RU486 and analyzed MMP expression by qPCR. RU486 treatment downregulated MMP3 (Fig. 5F) but not MMP9 (not
shown) in both wild-type and WAP-Epim organoids. MMP2
has been shown previously to signal downstream of Pgr in Pgra transgenic mice (17). Our results show that Epim-stimulated
MMP3 expression is also downstream of Pgr in WAP-Epim
mice.
WAP-Epim transgenic mice stimulate Pgr expression
and bud formation via integrin-aV
We asked whether integrin-aV, known to bind to Epim to
elicit downstream responses in 3D-collagen gels (13), was
required to stimulate precocious bud formation in WAP-Epim
mice. Treatment of organoids in the ex vivo 3D Lr-ECM assay
with integrin function blocking antibodies against integrin-aV
or IgG control did not show any morphological differences
when induced with TGFa (Fig. 6A and C). In contrast, WAPEpim mammary organoids treated with integrin-aV inhibitory
antibodies showed a 50% decrease in the number of organoids
with more than 3 alveolar buds compared with the anti-IgGtreated control antibody (Fig. 6A and C). Chemical inhibitors of
the mitogen-activated protein kinase and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathways, downstream of integrin-aV, were even
more potent inhibitors of alveolar development and proliferation in both wild-type and WAP-Epim transgenic mice (Fig.
6B and D). Finally, we showed that Epim controls Pgr expression through activation of integrin-aV after by downregulation
of Pgr expression following treatment with the inhibitor of
integrin-aV (Fig. 6E).

Discussion
In this article, we have deﬁned a role for Epim in postnatal
formation of the mammary gland. We found that overexpression of exogenous Epim or introduction of a recombinant Epim
peptide lead to precocious side branching and bud formation
in nulliparous mice. We found also that a peptide inhibitor of
Epim decreased side branching in wild-type mice. Because
WAP-Epim mice eventually develop mammary carcinoma,
these results suggest that Epim-induced precocious mammary
gland development may be a factor predisposing these mice to
mammary cancer later in life.
We believe this is the ﬁrst demonstration that Epim is a
regulator of Pgr-a expression. In the mouse mammary gland,
regulation is through integrin-aV. The ﬁnding could have
broad clinical implications for how Pgr is regulated in the
mammary gland during normal development as well as in
cancer progression by molecules in the cellular microenvironment. Increased Pgr-a expression has been shown previously to
be involved in mammary hyperplasia (16, 17) and mammary
tumors in BRCA1/P53 null transgenic mice (34). Our results
add to this literature by showing that the high propensity of
mammary cancer we have reported in this WAP-Epim mouse
model (15) is essentially because of increased Pgr.
Pgr is required for side branching and alveologenesis in the
mouse mammary gland (25, 29). We observed a striking
increase in Pgr mRNA and protein expression in WAP-Epim
mammary glands compared with wild type as well as upregulation of Pgr target genes such as Ccnd1, Cebpb, and keratin 14

(not shown; ref. 19). Treatment of WAP-Epim mice with the Pgr
antagonist, RU486, or addition of RU486 to the culture medium
of WAP-Epim organoids reduced side branching and alveolar
bud formation signiﬁcantly, showing that Pgr is downstream
and required for the observed Epim-induced effects.
The WAP-Epim mice share some similarities to the WAPMmp3 mice, including precocious alveolar development (35)
and spontaneous development of mammary cancer (15, 36, 37).
The mammary glands of Mmp3 knockout mice have decreased
lateral branching without any effect on ductal length (38),
similar to the phenotype we observed using the Epim inhibitor
in the mouse mammary gland. Treatment with rEpim was
shown to upregulate Mmp3 in mammary organoids in 3D
collagen gels (12). We found that RU486 blocked Mmp3 expression in both wild-type and WAP-Epim mice showing that Pgr
regulates Mmp3 in the mouse mammary gland. These results
implicate Mmp3 as an important effector downstream of Pgrinduced processes during mammary gland development, and
potentially also during mammary cancer progression.
In Brca1/P53 null mice, Pgr was shown to be upregulated,
because of decreased turnover of Pgr (34). In this mouse model,
upregulation of Pgr caused mammary tumor formation, and
inhibition of Pgr using RU486 decreased tumor formation (34).
Pgr is a well-established transcriptional target of Esr1, we did
not detect differences in Esr1 mRNA or protein expression
between the mammary glands of wild-type and WAP-Epim
pregnant mice. Therefore, Epim should be included as a novel
regulator of Pgr-a mRNA and protein. In addition, our study
shows that Epim-induced increase in Pgr-a expression also
leads to tumor formation.
It is important to note that we observed Epim induction of
Pgr without treating mice with either estrogen or progesterone
or adding the hormones to the organoid culture medium.
There is prior evidence for unliganded Pgr activity in development and cancer processes. One mechanism for Pgr unliganded activity is through activation of MAP kinase and/or
PI3kinase pathways (reviewed in refs. 39, 40). Because Epim
upregulates both of these pathways (13), it is likely that this
could explain the mode by which Epim activates Pgr-a.
We reported previously a profound morphological difference
between the mammary glands of the homozygous WAP-Epim
mice and those of the wild type. In addition, we reported that
the former have difﬁculty nursing their pups (14). However, we
did not observe any morphological differences between wildtype and WAP-Epim mammary glands of the hemizygous mice
during lactation by whole mount and histologic analysis (day
10). This included the number and size of alveolar structures
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). In addition, there were no measurable differences in b-casein expression at lactation (not shown),
and WAP-Epim mice were able to support full litters (10–12
pups, on average). The absence of an obvious morphological or
functional difference between wild-type and hemizygous transgenic mice at lactation is likely due to less transgene expression
compared with the homozygous WAP-Epim mice. Also, serum
progesterone level is known to drop precipitously at the onset
of lactation and remain low throughout lactation (reviewed in
ref. 41). This may diminish any effects of Epim-induced Pgr-a
effects in WAP-Epim hemizygous mice at this developmental

stage (14). These results further emphasize the importance of
the Epim-Pgr signaling axis.
In normal adult human breast cells, only 7% to 10% of
luminal epithelial cells express PGR and ESR1. In contrast,
70% of breast tumors express PGR and ESR1 (39). Cells that
express PGR in both normal human breast and mouse mammary gland are often growth arrested (34). However, during
pregnancy the proportion of cells that express PGR are
increased, often coexpress CCND1, and acquire the ability to
proliferate (reviewed in ref. 39); whereas human breast cancers
that lack ESR, PGR, and HER-2 are well known to have a poor
prognosis (reviewed in ref. 42), breast cancers that lack ESR but
express PGR have been reported to be more aggressive and
have a poorer prognosis than ESRþ/PGRþ, ESRþ/PGR, and
ESR/PGR breast cancers (43, 44). Our ﬁnding that Epim
induces Pgr-a in the absence of Esr1 upregulation highlights a
potential role for Epim in more aggressive tumors. These and
other data in the literature highlight the potential danger of
deregulation of Pgr and progesterone signaling in breast
cancer and underscore the possibility that the culprit in many
of the breast cancers may be progesterone rather than estrogen
(45). It is therefore surprising that in clinical settings more
attention is not paid to antiprogesterone receptor therapy
because in animal models the data for tumor inhibition is
indeed quite impressive (34).

Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that Epim controls mammary
branching morphogenesis in vivo through transcriptional regulation of Pgr-a. Transgenic expression of Epim caused
increased expression of Pgr-a, and inhibition of Epim in vivo
blocked Pgr-a expression. Pgr-a activity was essential for
mediating the effects of Epim on ductal side branching, epithelial cell proliferation, and bud formation. Pgr-a expression
was shown to be downstream of the association of Epim with
its extracellular receptor, integrin-aV, and upstream of MMP3, a key mediator of Epim-induced branching morphogenesis.
Our results also extend literature-linking Pgr-a expression and

mammary hyperplasia in transgenic mouse models, by showing that the high propensity for developing mammary cancer
we have reported in the WAP-Epim mouse model is essentially
because of increased Pgr-a. Finally, our ﬁnding that Epim
induces increased Pgr-a expression in the absence of Esr1
upregulation highlights a potential role for Epim in more
aggressive, Esr1-negative breast cancers.
