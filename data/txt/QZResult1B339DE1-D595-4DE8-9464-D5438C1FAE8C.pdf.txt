ABSTRACT
A cornerstone of preclinical cancer research has been the use of clonal cell lines.
However, this resource has underperformed in its ability to effectively identify novel
therapeutics and evaluate the heterogeneity in a patient’s tumor. The patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) model retains the heterogeneity of patient tumors, allowing a means
to not only examine efficacy of a therapy, but also basic tenets of cancer biology in
response to treatment. Herein we describe the development and characterization of
an ovarian-PDX model in order to study the development of chemoresistance. We
demonstrate that PDX tumors are not simply composed of tumor-initiating cells,
but recapitulate the original tumor’s heterogeneity, oncogene expression profiles,
and clinical response to chemotherapy. Combined carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment
of PDX tumors enriches the cancer stem cell populations, but persistent tumors are
not entirely composed of these populations. RNA-Seq analysis of six pair of treated
PDX tumors compared to untreated tumors demonstrates a consistently contrasting
genetic profile after therapy, suggesting similar, but few, pathways are mediating
chemoresistance. Pathways and genes identified by this methodology represent novel
approaches to targeting the chemoresistant population in ovarian cancer

INTRODUCTION

initial chemotherapy, to lie dormant and eventually
regrow with chemoresistant disease. Only by targeting this
subpopulation can we achieve durable cures [3, 4].
Pre-clinical models used in drug discovery have
predominately used clonal ovarian cancer cell lines, which
cannot account for tumor heterogeneity, and evolve though
selective growth and time to become very different from
tumors growing in patients. Recently some of the most
commonly used ovarian cell lines used were reported to
have profiles more like endometrioid than papillary serous
carcinoma, as defined by TCGA expression profiling[5].
Studying tumors preclinically that more closely
resemble human tumors may increase the likelihood that

Although most ovarian cancer patients present with
advanced-stage disease, response to front-line platinumbased chemotherapy is high, on the order of 75%. The
combination of surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy
will allow remission in most patients, and about 40%
of advanced stage patients will live at least 5 years [1].
However, absolute cures are uncommon, with 80% of
patients eventually having a recurrence [2]. The clinical
profile of high rates of positive responses yet high
recurrence rates suggests the presence of a subpopulation
of cells within the heterogeneous tumor that survives

medications effective in preclinical studies are effective
in clinical trials. The patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
model, whereby tumors are collected from patients and
immediately implanted into mice, has recently been
characterized and may allow such an advantage[6-8].
We set out to further characterize the PDX
model and determine whether the heterogeneity seen in
ovarian cancer is recapitulated, in order to explore the
cell populations responsible for chemoresistance. One
potential subpopulation with chemotherapy resistance
is the cancer stem cell (CSC) population. CSC’s have
been shown to have increased tumorigenicity in mice,
chemotherapy resistance, and are enriched in recurrent
ovarian cancer [9-11]. In developing and characterizing
the PDX model our goals were to 1) optimize methods
to allow a high success rate of implantation, 2) examine
retention of heterogeneity, 3) determine if PDX tumors
respond to chemotherapy similarly to patient tumors, 4)
assess whether treatment with chemotherapy results in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

survival of just CSC populations, and 5) identify pathways
that are amplified in resistant tumors. We demonstrate that
the PDX model can be established with a high success rate,
have similar expression profiles and biologic activities as
patient tumors, and can be used as a model to identify the
chemoresistant population.

RESULTS
Implantation success rate and establishment of
the ovarian PDX model
Here we report outcomes on the first 34 patient
samples implanted into SCID mice. Demographics for
patients from whom tumors were collected are presented
in Table 1. All patients had stage IIIC or IV high-grade
epithelial ovarian cancers, and tumors were collected prior
8751

to any chemotherapy.
Tumor collected and implanted into mice was either
from an omental metastasis or peritoneal implant, since
they are plentiful, composed of grossly-identifiable tumor,
and most relevant to recurrent disease.
Different sites of implantation in the mouse
were tested to identify the best location for growth.
Subcutaneous (SQ) and mammary fat pat (MFP) sites
were tested as their location allows for tumor growth to be
monitored with caliper-measurements. Intraperitoneal (IP)
injection was examined, to provide an orthotopic location
for model establishment. The subrenal capsule (SRC) was
evaluated given previous reports of high take rates in this
site [12]. Implantation for all 4 sites was conducted as

described in the methods. Therefore both site and method
of processing were controlled for each patient. The rates
for PDX tumor development in each site, including
individual implants are presented in Figure 1A. In the first
34 patients, a PDX line was established in 85.3% of SQ
implants. This is compared to 63.64% in the MFP, 22.2%
IP, and 8.3% in the SRC. SQ xenografts almost always
visually disappeared in the weeks after implantation
before regrowing and being detectable at a mean of 78.4
days after implantation (range 17-174 days, Figure 1C)
compared to 77.3 days for the MFP (range 29 to 129 days,
NS). The success of a PDX being established is highest
in the SQ site in part due to the increased number of
implants per patient. Based on this data, and subsequent

subcutaneously (SQ), in the mammary fat pad (MFP), intraperitoneal (IP), or sub-renal capsule. The success of implantation was similar

studies showing similar expression profiles in tumors from
the SQ site and original patient tumors (described below),
continued development of the PDX model was done in
the SQ site. PDX tumors were examined for histologic
characteristics by a gynecologic pathologist. In all cases
and in up to six generations of reimplantation, the original
histology was maintained (Figure 1D). Interestingly, in the
few cases where a mixed epithelial-type ovarian cancer
was implanted, both histologies were present in each of
the subsequent PDX generations.

One potential advantage of the PDX model is that
it may maintain patient heterogeneity, as opposed to the
clonality that ultimately characterizes cell lines. However,
a growing body of evidence suggests that certain cell
subpopulations have enhanced ability to initiate tumors,
often termed tumor-initiating cells (TIC’s) or sometimes
CSC’s if additional attributes are demonstrated [10]. We
examined whether resulting PDX tumors maintained tumor
heterogeneity from a tumor-initiating cell standpoint.

PDX tumors and original patient tumors were subjected to
IHC for the TIC markers ALDH1A1 [11, 13, 14], CD133
[15-17], and CD44 [18, 19]. For ALDH1A1, CD44,
and CD133, the patient samples averaged expression
of 19.95%, 5.56%, and 3.27% respectively. The PDX
tumors had similar expression of ALDH1A1 and CD133
at 17.4%, and 7.1% respectively (p=0.80 and 0.49, Figure
2A, 2B). There was a significant change in expression
of CD44, but it was actually a decrease, from 5.54% to
2.36% (p=0.014). If TICs in ovarian cancer are indeed the
cells mediating xenograft formation, these data suggest
that they subsequently differentiate into marker-positive
and -negative cells and recapitulate tumor heterogeneity,
in keeping with the CSC hypothesis[10, 20].
Related to heterogeneity, the human/murine
component of PDX tumor would have implications to the

biologic relevance of this model. IHC for human HLA
antigen was conducted to identify the species-specific
composition of the PDX tumor. Interestingly, all stromal
cells in the PDX tumors were of murine origin (Figure 2C).
This was consistent across 100% of the tumor specimen,
and in all of the first 15 PDX tumors established.

Biological and clinical characterization of PDX
tumors
To begin to evaluate the biologic characteristics
of PDX tumors compared to original patient tumors,
we examined oncogenic expression, proliferation, and
response to chemotherapy. Weroha et al have previously
demonstrated similar amplification and deletion patterns

Figure 3: Cancer drug targets are maintained in the PDX line and the PDX response to treatment correlates to the
patient’s response to primary chemotherapy. (A) The SABiociences RT2 qPCR array for cancer drug targets was run on the

patient’s tumor and their matched untreated PDX tumor. Differences in relative gene expression for each target was calculated and the 2ΔCt
value was determined. Most of the 84 cancer drug target genes had similar expression in the PDX and the original patient sample. 5 gene
were down-regulated in the PDX sample, though all 5 are related to VEGF and PDGF signaling (circled in grey). (B) The SABiosciences
RT2 qPCR array for cancer drug targets was run on matched subcutaneous PDX tumors and intraperitoneal PDX tumors. Differences in
relative gene expression for each target was calculated and the 2ΔCt value was determined. All 84 cancer drug target genes showed a strong
correlation between the IP and SQ PDX tumors(C) PDX lines were treated with combination carboplatin and paclitaxel IP weekly. The
percent change in tumor volume at 30 days was compared to the patient’s response to primary therapy. PDX lines with the greatest decrease
in volume significantly correlated to patients with a complete response to therapy (p=0.0009) (D) Classifying reduction in tumor volume by
outcome of tumor reductive surgery (optimal debulking vs suboptimal) shows a trend towards PDX with the greatest reduction in volume
correlating to optimal debulking for the patient (p-value = NS).

Biologic mediators of chemotherapy resistance in
the PDX

between PDX and patient tumors using aCGH [6]. To
characterize whether expression of key oncogenes are
similarly expressed in PDX tumors, an RT2 PCR array
on four pair of patient samples and matched PDX tumors
was used. This array quantifies mRNA levels of 84 genes
that are recognized targetable oncogenes[21]. There was
a strong correlation of expression in 79 of the cancer
drug targets, with an overall R2-value of .744 (Figure
3A). This correlation was also present in individual
samples (Supplemental Figure 1). The five genes that
exhibited the poorest correlation had expression in the
patient with near-zero mRNA expression in the PDX.
These genes were platelet-derived growth factor receptor,
alpha and beta polypeptide (PDGFRA, PDGFRB) and
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor one, two,
and three (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGF3). These genes
were expected to be decreased in the PDX tumor, since
they are produced by the host, and the primers are
human-specific. Therefore, there is strong consistency in
expression of targetable oncogenes intrinsic to malignant
cells, despite the fact that these tumors are growing in the
subcutaneous compartment. In addition, we profiled the
genetic difference of oncogene expression using the RT2
PCR array comparing PDX tumors from the IP location
versus the SQ implant. There was a strong correlation
of expression among the 84 genes in the oncogene drug
target array, with an overall R2-value of .8895 (Figure 3B).
This indicates that the SQ tumor has similar expression to
a tumor growing in the orthotopic location.
While expression at the single-gene level is
important, biologic similarity regarding response to
treatment is equally important. Mice with measurable
tumors from 19 PDX models were treated with IP
carboplatin (90 mg/kg/week) and paclitaxel (20 mg/kg/
week) in combination for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, percentreduction in tumor volume was calculated and compared to
the patient’s response to therapy, categorized as complete
(CR, no evidence of disease at completion of 6 cycles of
primary chemotherapy) or partial (PR, residual disease
present at completion of 6 cycles of primary therapy).
Patients that had a CR to therapy had an average reduction
in volume of 63.73% (range 95.04% to 24.87%) compared
to an average reduction of just 1.53% (range 57.77%
reduction to 107.9% increase) in patients that had a PR (p
= 0.0009, Figure 3C). There was also a differential, but not
significant, response between patients who had an optimal
or suboptimal tumor reductive surgery (Figure 3D).
While not definitive, this suggests that patients presenting
with disease unable to be optimally debulked are more
aggressive and resistant to chemotherapy.

With evidence showing that the PDX model
accurately replicates the biology and clinical properties
of the original patient tumor, we sought to explore
differences between matched untreated and treated
tumors. Mice were treated as described above, with
tumors harvested 6 days after the 4th weekly dose, to
minimize acute tumoral effects that might occur after
chemotherapy administration. Ki-67 was examined to
measure proliferation, and was not significantly different
in untreated PDX tumors compared to the original patient
tumor (Figure 4A,B). However, treated tumors had
significant decrease in Ki-67 positivity (33.6% compared
to 64.9% in untreated tumors p=0.0013). Examining the
trend of each tumor individually (Figure 4C), two pair
actually showed an increase in Ki-67, one of which had a
107% increase in tumor size on therapy, but the other with
a 70.9% reduction. Despite these aberrations, the overall
decrease in proliferating fraction suggests that dormancy
is either being induced by chemotherapy, or some cells
are already in a dormant state at presentation, and have
intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy.
For analysis of which subpopulations have enhanced
survival with chemotherapy, we assessed the density of
the CSC populations expressing ALDH1A1, CD44, and
CD133. If these populations were important to survival
in the presence of chemotherapy, they should be more
densely present after treatment, as noted in human
specimens [11]. Treatment resulted in the significant
enrichment of ALDH1A1-positive cells (increased
from 16.2 to 36.1%, p=0.002) and CD133-positive cells
(increased from 9.5% to 33.8%, p=0.011) (Figure 4D).
Mean CD44 expression increased, but this was driven by
two samples, and was not significant. These data suggests
treated tumors are enriched in CSC populations.

Although cells with CSC properties were increased
in treated specimens, they did not make up the entirety
of the tumor. To globally examine which other genes and
pathways are significantly altered during chemotherapy
treatment, RNA-Seq was conducted on 6 pairs of treated
and untreated PDX tumors. Across all six pairs, 299 genes
were found to be significantly differentially expressed
in the treated PDX samples compared to untreated
(Supplementary Table 1), 137 of which have known roles
in cancer. The top up-regulated genes and down-regulated
genes are in Table 2. When principal component analysis
was performed, an interesting trend emerged. Four of the
samples clustered together, and the remaining two were
separated in the 3D space. All the treated samples showed a

shift in the same direction away from their untreated PDX
pair (Figure 5). This indicates that while the majority of
genes are similar before and after treatment, all six tumors
were affected similarly by therapy. IPA pathway analysis
identified 5 major pathways that were significantly altered
with treatment and key changes in molecular and cellular
function (Table 2). Changes in these biological functions
and pathways are consistent with the visualized phenotype
of tumors responding to chemotherapy and reorganizing
cellular function to adapt for survival.

We demonstrated the feasibility of an ovarian
PDX model that closely models the heterogeneity of the
original patient’s tumor and maintains clinical relevance.
Ovarian PDX tumors form at a high rate when placed in
the subcutaneous location. Growing tumors recapitulate
the heterogeneity of the original patient tumor, and
are not composed of just TICs, though the stromal
component is murine. The PDX tumors have similar
oncogene expression as the patient tumor, and respond
8757

Oncotarget

to chemotherapy in a similar manner as the patients from
which they were harvested. These similarities make the
PDX model an attractive platform for pre-clinical testing
of therapies that will hopefully correlate with a clinical
response better than noted in cell lines. Finally, using this
model has allowed identification of pathways mediating
survival after chemotherapy that are attractive targets for
future study.
In most malignancies, preclinical studies have
primarily utilized cell lines to assess novel therapies and
biologic processes. Cell lines are still ideal for carefully
controlled studies on mechanisms and pathways. However,
in terms of translating results to the clinic, these models
have underperformed [22]. The clonal nature of cell lines
limits the ability to study both intratumoral and interpatient
heterogeneity [8, 23]. In addition, new genomic studies
indicate that commonly-used ovarian cancer cell lines do
not accurately represent high-grade serous ovarian cancers
when compared to profiling performed on the TCGA
dataset[5 ].
Development of PDX models have been
demonstrated in a few malignancies, including ovarian,
colorectal, medulloblastoma, pancreatic, breast, and nonsmall cell lung cancers [6, 24-29], and have consistently
been found to be similar to patient samples. One wellestablished program in pediatric malignancies has
demonstrated prediction of response in the clinic is higher
when the PDX model is used [30]. However, there are
drawbacks to the model. The time for PDX tumors to grow
is variable, but usually on the order of months, making
experiments slow and expensive. Historically, rates for

success of PDX establishment have been low, with the
most successful models having 37% establishment rate
[28, 31, 32], until Weroha’s recent report of 74% overall
success in ovarian cancer[6]. In this study, we had 85.29%
success rate of establishing a PDX in the first 34 patients
we implanted in the SQ. We believe the higher success
rate is due to several factors. Given similar success of
Weroha’s report, this may be disease-specific. Strong
working relationships with clinicians and pathologists
allow for implantation within one hour of removal.
We used two different processing methods that could
be directly compared - one where solid tumors were
implanted (SQ and SRC), and one where tumors were
dissociated (MFP and IP). With both methods, the take
rate was more dependent on the site implanted than the
processing method. A crucial factor is the starting material.
Other groups have reported that higher engraftment
rates are associated with more aggressive tumors [6, 8,
29]. Instead of using the primary tumor from the ovary,
we have implanted omental or peritoneal metastatic
implants. The reasons for this are both biologic and
practical. From a practical standpoint, omental implants
are easily distinguished from normal tissue, reducing the
risk of implanting normal tissue. A portion of “tumor”
taken from the ovary, a complex tissue with normal solid
components, may more likely be misinterpreted grossly
as tumor, when in fact was benign. Because the omentum
is well-vascularized, tumors are very “healthy”, giving
additional confidence that the portion implanted is not
necrotic. Finally, it has been demonstrated that other
factors produced in the omental microenvironment are

pro-tumorigenic, and are likely implanted with these
tumors[33]. The biologic rationale for using metastatic
implants is that these sites are more relevant to the portions
of tumors that recur. Therefore it may be more clinically
relevant to characterize the metastatic site.
The site of implantation is an important
consideration as there are benefits and drawbacks from
using an orthotopic or heterotopic site. Heterotopic
locations allows for easier monitoring of the tumor while
orthotopic preserves the appropriate microenvironment
[24]. However, in developing this model, use of the
intraperitoneal orthotopic location had practical limitations
of lower engraftment rates and difficulty in assessment of
growth. In several instances mice become moribund with
ascites before there was appreciable tumor volume, even
when following with micro-CT imaging. This limits the
ability to measure response to a therapy, and provides less
tissue for analysis and propagation into the next generation
of PDX. However, the Weroha study demonstrated an
ability for high take rate using the intraperitoneal injection
with large volumes of tumor-cells [6]. Like our study,
their mice also demonstrated development of ascites
but by using ultrasound, were able to more accurately
follow tumor progression then using a micro-CT. By
using the heterotopic location, tumor growth can be
easily monitored for establishment, growth, and response
to therapy [8]. However, biologic relevance has to be
demonstrated. With our findings that subcutaneous tumors
have similar oncogene expression profiles to patient
tumors and the orthotopic intraperitoneal PDX tumors,
and respond to chemotherapy similarly, the subcutaneous
model appears relevant. This information helps alleviate
the primary concern of not using the orthotopic location
and provides a mechanism for decreasing the technical
complexity of establishing and using a PDX model. While
in our hands, not enough intraperitoneal tumors developed
to evaluate their correlation to the clinical response, based
on our oncogene data comparing SQ and IP tumors and the
Weroha study, it appears both models are equivalent. Not
enough intraperitoneal tumors developed to demonstrate
whether they would be equivalent, or superior, to the
subcutaneous model. While previous groups have reported
a high rate of success using the subrenal-capsule for
tumor establishment [12], we did not see these successes.
The ultimate proof of the importance of location in the
PDX model will require testing numerous compounds,
and relating the response in PDX tumors to responses
in patients. PDX models in other malignancies have
demonstrated a similar response rate between mice and
the corresponding clinical trial [34-36]. Such studies
in ovarian cancer are ongoing. But our analysis of
the oncogene expression profiles, and their consistent
similarity to patient tumors (Figure 3A), suggest that
differences in targetable oncogenes between orthotopic
PDX tumors and patient tumors are minimal.
We also demonstrate that the ovarian PDX model
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

maintains the heterogeneity of the original patient tumor,
at least from a TIC standpoint. Studies of CSC and TIC
populations have shown that some cells are more capable
of forming xenograft tumors than other[37]. Our analysis
of density of ALDH1A1, CD44, and CD133 cells, the
most consistent markers of TICs in ovarian cancer,
demonstrates that PDX tumors are not only composed of
these subpopulations (Figure 2B). It is possible that these
subpopulations are the drivers of tumor formation, but as
they grow they produce differentiated tumors with both
CSC and non-CSC populations. This in fact would be
predicted by the CSC model.
Potential limitations to the PDX model in ovarian
cancer have been identified through our analysis. We saw
that of 84 oncogenes examined, 5 were under-expressed
in PDX tumors: receptors for platelet-derived growth
factors and VEGF receptors. The fact that all members
of these receptor families strengthens the validity of the
association. Analysis of the species making up tumor
stroma showed it to be composed purely of murine origin.
The reduced content of human stromal genes is expected
[38] as a result of the replacement of the human stroma
with mouse stromal cells after implantation. Prior reports
in pancreatic cancer have suggested that human stromal
cells are maintained for several generations[39], although
Weroha et al also found that IP ovarian PDX tumors
had murine stroma. Whether murine stroma impacts the
validity of the model will depend on the specific agent and
pathway targeted.
The heterogeneity demonstrated in ovarian PDX
tumors makes it uniquely positioned to investigate the
key clinical problem of chemoresistance and recurrence.
Ovarian cancer has a high rate of response to primary
chemotherapy followed by an equally high rate of
recurrence. One hypothesis is that this population is
the same as the tumorigenic CSC population. While
we have seen an increase in CSC density in the treated
PDX tumors, and previously in treated patients[11],
the persistent/recurrent tumors were by no means
completely composed of these populations. Either the
CSC populations had already begun to give rise to
repopulating daughter cells negative for the CSC marker,
or (more likely) other chemoresistant populations exist
that cannot be identified by ALDH1A1, CD44, or CD133
alone. Going beyond CSCs, we have shown that surviving
tumors have more cells in dormancy, decreasing from a
baseline of 65% to 34%. RNA-seq analysis resulted in
299 genes being significantly different between the treated
and untreated tumors with principal component analysis
indicating that the changes in gene expression represent
a small subset of the entire genetic makeup of the tumor
(Figure 5, Supplementary Table 1). Most remarkable
and encouraging is that the changes were similar in all
pairs tested, providing hope that there may be common
pathways to be targeted in most patients. One of the top
up-regulated genes was ABCG1 (BCRP1), a member
8759

Oncotarget

of the White family of ATP-Binding cassette (ABC)
transporters. Expression of ABCG1 has been shown to
identify a side population of cancer cells that demonstrate
CSC properties and chemoresistance [40]. Interestingly,
one of the top activated pathways identified by IPA
Ingenuity pathway analysis was Sphingosine-1-phosphate
signaling. This pathway has been shown to protect oocytes
from apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents in
vitro and in vivo [41, 42]. Taken together, the enrichment
of CSC markers in the treated population, decrease in
cell proliferation, and increase in genes and signaling
pathways predicted to play a role in chemoresistance, it
appears that treatment of the ovarian PDX results in the
survival of a cell population that is chemoresistant to
primary therapy. The global analysis by RNAseq provides
a snapshot of possible pathways that are responsible
for the development of chemoresistance. These will be
important targets for therapy in future studies. With the
development of an ovarian PDX model that recapitulates
the clinical response and the heterogeneity of ovarian
cancer, investigators are positioned to more effectively
evaluate novel therapeutics and use the model to improve
our understanding of the mechanisms of chemotherapy
resistance. Hopefully targeting these pathways will
sensitize cells to chemotherapy and lead to more durable
cures.

SCID mice (NCI-Frederick, Frederick MD) into four
sites: subcutaneous (SQ), subrenal capsule (SRC),
intraperitoneally (IP), and mammary fat pad (MFP).
To discover the optimal site for tumor growth, of the
first 22 patients, 22 were implanted SQ and MFP, 18
IP, and 12 SRC. When enough tumor was available, all
four sites were implanted to allow direct comparison of
growth rates. After it was evident that the subcutaneous
implantation site was optimal, an additional 11 patients
had tumors implanted only SQ.
For SQ implants, 5mm2 tumor pieces (n=20 per
patient) adjacent to the slice used for confirmation of
histology were sectioned. 5 mice were implanted with
four tumors each. The dorsal surface of the mouse was
shaved and prepped with betadine solution. A 1cm midline
incision was made and with blunt dissection, four pockets
were created in four quadrants of the flank of the SCID
mouse. One 5mm2 tumor implant was placed in each
quadrant and the incision was closed with staples.
For SRC implantation, five 3mm2 tumor sections
were prepared for implantation into five mice, one kidney
per mouse. An incision was made in the body wall along
the long axis of the kidney. The kidney was gently
exposed through the incision, a 4 mm incision was made
in the renal capsule, and an implant was inserted. The
kidney was gently placed back into the body cavity and
incision was closed with chromic gut sutures. For both
SQ and SRC implantation, mice were anesthetized using
isoflorane with 5% for induction of anesthesia and 1.5%
for maintenance. Mice were administered carprofen (7mg/
kg, Pfizer) prior to incision to reduce post-operative pain.
For injection into the MFP and IP sties, an adjacent
portion of tumor was manually dissociated until fine
enough to pass through a 21g needle. Prior to injection, the
suspension was added to an equal volume of BD Matrigel
(BD Biosciences, Cat#356234), mixed, and injected
intraperitoneally (500,000 cells) or into bilateral MFPs
(250,000 cells). Five mice were injected IP, and five mice
had cells injected into the left and right MFP.

CONCLUSION
Development of an ovarian PDX model to study de
novo chemotherapy resistance provides a unique use of the
xenograft model beyond testing pre-clinical compounds,
allowing for possible novel understandings of tumoral
responses to therapy that may lead to new strategies for
targeting the residual survival population after primary
therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and Implantation of tumor specimens

Treatment of PDX lines with chemotherapy

Under IRB and IACUC approval, patients with
suspected ovarian cancer that were being treated by
the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at UAB were
consented for this study. At the time of primary tumor
reductive surgery, a specimen from an omental metastasis
or peritoneal implant that was not required for pathologic
diagnosis was collected and transported to the laboratory
for processing. Specimens were sectioned and a portion
submitted for formalin-fixed-paraffin embedding; placed
in RNAlater (Qiagen, Frederick, MD); snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen , and slow freezing in Optimal Cutting
Temperature (OCT) Medium, and stored at -80°C.
Remaining tumor was isolated for implantation into

Once SQ or MFP tumors reached 500 mm2 in
volume, chemotherapy treatment was initiated in mice
from 21 patients. Mice were injected IP with 90 mg/
kg of carboplatin and 20 mg/kg of paclitaxel weekly or
with vehicle, doses which approximate the maximal
tolerated dose used in weekly dose-dense schedule of
carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients. Tumors were
measured biweekly using calipers. Volume of tumor was
calculated using the formula (Length x Width2)/2. After
5 weeks of treatment (4 weekly doses, then one week
after last chemotherapy dose in order to minimize acute
tumor effects of chemotherapy), mice were euthanized
by CO­­2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation. Samples
of treated and mice treated with vehicle were stored for

future analysis. Any remaining tumor was reimplanted for
maintenance of the PDX.

RNA extracted from stored samples was converted
to cDNA and amplified using the RT2 First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (SABiosciences). Gene expression was then
analyzed using the Cancer Drug Targets RT2 Profiler PCR
Array (SABiosciences), which profiles the expression of
84 genes that are potential oncogenic targets for anticancer
therapeutics [21]. PCR amplification was conducted on an
ABI Prism 7900HT and gene expression was calculated
using the comparative CT method as previously described
[43].

Immunohistochemistry of patient samples and
tumors from PDX tumors
Samples in FFPE were cut into 5 µm sections
and placed on positively-charged slides. Hematoxylin
and eosin stained tissue was analyzed by a gynecologic
pathologist to confirm histology. For IHC of ALDH1A1,
CD133, CD44, Ki-67 and human-HLA, slides were
deparaffinized and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was
with 10 mM sodium citrate at pH 6.0 under pressure .
Slides were washed in PBS. Endogenous peroxidases
were blocked with 3% H­­2O2 in methanol. For ALDH1A1,
CD133, and CD44, slides were blocked with Ctyo-Q
immune-diluent (Innovex Biosciences Cat#NB307)
followed by primary antibody incubation in Ctyo-Q
immune diluent. Antibody concentrations were as follows:
ALDH1A1 – 1:500 (BD Biosciences, Cat#611195) CD133
– 1:500 (Cell Signaling, Cat#3663S), CD44 – 1:500 (Cell
Signaling, Cat# 3570S). After primary antibody, slides
were washed in PBS. Primary antibody detection was
achieved with Mach 4 HRP polymer (Biocare Medical),
followed by 3,3’-diaminobenzidine incubation. Slides
were counterstained with Gill’s Hematoxylin then washed
in water and PBS. Slides were sealed with Universal
Mount (Open Biosystems, Cat#MBI1232). For Ki-67
(Abgent cat# AJ1427b) and human HLA (Proteintech
Group Cat#15240-1), primary antibodies were used at
concentrations of 1:200 in 10% normal goat serum. After
incubation, slides were washed and blocked with 5%
goat serum in 1X PBS. Primary antibody detection was
visualized using an anti-rabbit HRP secondary at 1:500
in 5% goat serum (Vector Labs, Cat# PI-1000) and DAB
substrate. Slides were counterstained as described above.

High throughput sequencing of untreated and
treated PDX tumors
Sample preparation, raw data prepressing, quality
control were conducted in UAB Genomics Core and
preliminary analysis was conducted in the UAB Biostatics
Core. For RNA-seq, total RNA quality was assessed and
the rRNA depleted and concentrated. The RNA-Seq
libraries were prepared, validated and quantified. The
raw fastq files were aligned to human genome hg19 of
a local instance of Partek Flow software package (Saint
Louis, MO). Pre-alignment was conducted to determine if
trimming is needed based on reads quality score. Aligner
STAR was used for best recovery[44]. The BAM files
were loaded into Partek Genomics Suite 6.6 (Saint Louis,
MO) for further analysis [45]. The reads per kilobase
of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM)normalized reads were calculated and the expression
levels of genes were estimated [46]. Additional filter
was applied to exclude genes of low expression. The
differential expressions were determined by using paired
t-test [47]. Further functional analysis was conducted by
using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Redwood City,
CA).

Scoring of IHC for TIC makers and Ki67

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Two examiners (AK and CNL) visually estimated
the percent of cancer cells staining for ALDH1A1, CD133,
CD44, and Ki-67. A 3rd examiner (MGC) was included
if there was a >20% discrepancy. The examiners were
blinded to the experimental condition for each slide,
and a 4th investigator (ZCD) averaged the scores for
each specimen and decoded samples for analysis. To be
consistent with prior identification of CSCs with flow
cytometry, for CD133 and CD44 only expression at the
surface membrane was considered. The average number
of positive tumor cells for each marker was compared
between the untreated PDX tumor and the patient’s tumor,
and between the treated and untreated PDX, with Student’s
t-test.
