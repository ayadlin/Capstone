BACKGROUND: Among patients with stage I breast cancer, there is significant uncertainty concerning the optimal threshold at which
to consider chemotherapy, and when considered, there is controversy regarding whether to consider non-intensive versus intensive
regimens. The authors examined the types and costs of adjuvant chemotherapy received among patients with stage I breast cancer.
METHODS: The current study was a prospective cohort study including patients with stage I breast cancer who were treated at a
National Comprehensive Cancer Network center from 2000 through 2009. Stage was defined according to the version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual applicable at the time of diagnosis. Stratifying by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), the authors examined the percentage of patients receiving intensive versus non-intensive chemotherapy regimens
and the factors associated with type of chemotherapy administered using multivariable logistic regression. Costs of the most common regimens were estimated. RESULTS: Of 8907 patients, 33% received adjuvant chemotherapy. Among those individuals, there
was an increase in the use of intensive chemotherapy within the last decade, from 31% in 2000 through 2005 to 63% in 2008 through
2009 (including an increase in the use of the combination of docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab) among patients with HER2positive disease and from 15% in 2000 through 2005 to 41% in 2008 through 2009 among patients with HER2-negative disease (32%
of patients with hormone receptor-positive and 59% of patients with triple-negative disease). Among patients treated with non-intensive regimens, there was an increase in the use of the combination of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide noted, with a decrease in the
use of the doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide combination. The choice of regimen varied significantly by institution. The major drivers of cost variation were the incorporation of biologics (eg, trastuzumab) and growth factors, with significant variation even within
non-intensive and intensive regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Over time, there was an increase in use of intensive regimens among Stage I

INTRODUCTION
Stage I breast cancers represent nearly one-half of early breast cancer diagnoses and generally have an excellent prognosis.1,2 However, some patients have a sufficient risk of disease recurrence to drive a recommendation for adjuvant
chemotherapy.3,4
The chemotherapy landscape for patients with early breast cancer has changed over time.5,6 In the early 2000’s, several trials demonstrated that multi-agent chemotherapy regimens such as combinations of anthracyclines and taxanes were
more effective for the treatment of patients with early breast cancer compared with anthracycline-based regimens such as
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC), although they increased the duration and cost of therapy and were associated
with more toxicity.6,7 In approximately 2006, taxane-based regimens without anthracyclines also demonstrated efficacy,
although these regimens also had other potential toxicities, such as febrile neutropenia and neurotoxicity.6-8 At the same
time, multiple phase 3 trials suggested that adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a 40% risk reduction
in disease recurrence compared with chemotherapy alone.9 To our knowledge, patients with stage I disease have generally
been excluded or underrepresented in such trials and therefore there is uncertainty regarding the preferred chemotherapy
for these individuals.6,10
In the current study, we attempted to describe how medical oncologists have translated the above findings into routine practice. We focused on patients treated at a National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) center, and examined the type and costs of adjuvant chemotherapy and factors associated with its choice according to biologic subtype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Data Source

The current study was a prospective cohort study performed using the NCCN breast cancer outcomes database. Patients were included if they received all or some of
their treatment at a reporting center. Eight centers contributed data: City of Hope Cancer Research Hospital,
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,
Fox Chase Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Roswell Park Cancer Institute, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer
Center, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer
Center, and Ohio State University.11
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) from participating centers approved the study protocol. At centers in
which the IRB required signed informed consent for data
collection, only patients who provided consent were
included; elsewhere, the IRB granted a waiver of signed
informed consent.
An analytic cohort of 8907 patients with stage I
breast cancer was identified, 2923 of whom received
1938

chemotherapy (Fig. 1). Stage was defined according to
the version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual applicable at the time of
diagnosis. Patients treated with trastuzumab without
chemotherapy (14 patients) were not included in the
subgroup of patients treated with chemotherapy.
Dependent Variables: Type of Chemotherapy
Received

The database contains information regarding drug treatment as abstracted by chart review. Type of chemotherapy
was grouped as intensive versus non-intensive, defined as
shown in Table 1. Approximately 14% of patients were
treated on trial.
Independent Variables

Information regarding tumor size, tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), hormone receptor (HR), Oncotype Dx recurrence scores (Genomic Health, Inc) (RS),

status was abstracted from pathology reports. HR was
considered positive if the estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor were positive. For HER2 classification,
the fluorescence in situ hybridization result was used, if
available. If only immunohistochemistry was available,
scores of 31, “high positive,” or “positive NOS [not otherwise specified]” were considered HER2 positive,
whereas scores of 21, 11, 0, or “negative” were considered HER2 negative; 63 patients (1%) were “positive
NOS.” Oncotype Dx RS were categorized as low (1-17),
intermediate (18-30), or high (31-100).Tumor grade was
categorized as high (according to histologic grade or, if
not available, by nuclear grade) or low-intermediate. Age
at diagnosis was abstracted by chart review. Data regarding race/ethnicity were derived from patient surveys collected at the time of the initial presentation to the NCCN
center, whereas information regarding comorbidities was
collected either via surveys or chart review. The comorbidity score was derived from the systems of Charlson et al
Cancer

and Katz et al.12,13 Of the entire cohort, cardiac comorbidities were only present at baseline in 2.4% of patients
and therefore this was not explored as an independent
variable.
Costs

Drug costs per regimen included costs of chemotherapy
drugs, trastuzumab, and growth factor support. Antiemetics, transfusions, and other supportive therapies were not
included. For the primary cost estimates analyses, we used
the following formula: total cost per regimen 5 total mg
per cycle 3 price per mg (US$) 3 1.06 3 the number of
cycles per regimen, applying the dosing proposed by the
NCCN guidelines10 and the 2006 Medicare Part B Drug
Average Sales Price.14 The costs were estimated for a 50year-old woman with a body surface area of 1.7, weight of
70 kg, and serum creatinine level of 1 mg/dL. We
repeated these analyses with the 2009 and 2014 Medicare
Part B Drug Average Sales Price.14

receiving chemotherapy and (B2) the percentage of patients with HER2-negative/HR-negative disease receiving chemotherapy.

Statistical Analysis

All the analyses were stratified by HER2 status. The
receipt of chemotherapy and of a particular regimen over
time was summarized descriptively. For patients with
HER2-negative disease, we further stratified the analysis
by HR status.
Multivariable logistic regression models examined
patient characteristics associated with the type of chemotherapy received. To understand what currently drives
medical decisions, these models were restricted to patients
whose adjuvant chemotherapy was not given within a
clinical trial and to those diagnosed in 2006 and thereafter, which coincided with the publication of the US Oncology Adjuvant Trial 9735 comparing AC with the
combination of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) as
adjuvant therapy for patients with breast cancer and after
the adjuvant trastuzumab trial presentations, including
the Breast Cancer International Research Group
(BCIRG) 006 trial of the combination of docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH), AC followed by paclitaxel and trastuzumab (ACTH), or chemotherapy
without trastuzumab.7,8
Separate models were fit for the HER2-negative and
HER2-positive cohorts. We used logistic regression models to examine whether the patient received an intensive
chemotherapy regimen versus a non-intensive regimen.
Among patients with HER2-positive disease, we examined patient characteristics associated with the type of intensive chemotherapy regimen (TCH vs ACTH). Among
patients with HER2-negative disease, we examined
patient characteristics associated with the type of non-intensive chemotherapy regimen (TC vs AC). All variables
1940

were included in the models. The association between
Oncotype Dx RS and type of chemotherapy is only relevant for the subgroup of patients with HER2-negative/
HR-positive disease. Of the subgroup of 485 patients
included in the multivariable model with HER2-negative/HR-positive tumors, 55% (265 patients) had an
available Oncotype Dx RS result. Among these patients,
we explored the univariate association between Oncotype
Dx RS and type of chemotherapy.
Cost per common regimen was summarized descriptively. All P values presented are 2-sided, with statistical
significance defined as P <.05. Statistical analyses were
conducted using Stata statistical software (version 13.1;
StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex).
RESULTS
Use of Chemotherapy From 2000 to 2009

Among 8907 patients with stage I breast cancer, 33%
received chemotherapy, with striking differences in chemotherapy use observed by subtype of disease; a higher percentage of patients with HER2-positive disease (66%)
and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (HER2-negative/HR-negative disease) (74%) received chemotherapy
when compared with patients with HER2-negative/HRpositive disease (21%) (Fig. 1).Time trends in chemotherapy use differed by subtype (Fig. 2).

(722 patients) and (B) patients with HER2-negative disease, subdivided into (B1) the percentage of all patients receiving each
chemotherapy regimen (2201 patients), (B2) the percentage of patients with HER2-negative/hormone receptor (HR)-positive disease receiving each chemotherapy regimen (1425 patients), and (B3) the percentage of patients with HER2-negative/HR-negative disease receiving each chemotherapy regimen (749 patients).

contributed differently to this trend; by 2008 through
2009, only 32% of patients with HR-positive disease who
were treated with chemotherapy received intensive regimens, but 59% of patients with TNBC received an
anthracycline and taxane combination.
Use of Non–Anthracycline-Containing Regimens

In 2000, 87% of patients received anthracycline-based
regimens. However, by 2008 through 2009, 55% of
patients with HER2-positive disease received TCH and,
among patients with HER2-negative disease, TC was
used by 59% of patients receiving non-intensive chemotherapy regimens.
Factors Associated With the Choice of
Chemotherapy

The baseline characteristics of patients treated between
2006 and 2009 off trial were similar to those of the overall
1942

cohort (data not shown). There were small differences in
the comorbidity score noted among the patients with
HER2-positive disease (18% of those treated off trial vs
10% of those treated on trial had 1 comorbidities). Table 3 represents the results of the multivariable model,
which examined characteristics associated with the type of
chemotherapy received.
Among patients with HER2-positive disease, characteristics that were found to factor into the use of intensive versus non-intensive chemotherapy regimens
included year of diagnosis, NCCN center, and tumor
size. These analyses confirmed an increase in the use of intensive regimens over time (odds ratio [OR], 1.43 per
year of diagnosis; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
1.06-1.92). As expected, patients with larger tumors had a
higher probability of receiving an intensive regimen (OR,
2.03 per cm; 95% CI, 1.04-3.96). We observed dramatic
institutional variability (using center A as a reference, the

into (B1) the percentage of patients receiving each chemotherapy regimen off trial (1921 patients) and (B2) the percentage of

OR of receiving intensive vs non-intensive therapy ranged
between 0.05-1.10 [P<.001], with the unadjusted institutional use of intensive regimens ranging from 42%-90%).
These same characteristics were found to be associated
with the choice of TCH versus ACTH. There was an
increase in the use of TCH over time (OR, 1.83 per year
of diagnosis; 95% CI, 1.34-2.51). Patients with larger
tumors were less likely to be treated with TCH versus
ACTH (OR, 0.25 per cm; 95% CI, 0.12-0.51). Finally,
the unadjusted institutional use of TCH regimens ranged
from 25% to 53%.
For patients with HER2-negative disease, variables
that were found to factor into the choice of intensive regimens included the same significant predictors as for
patients with HER2-positive disease (year, NCCN center
[the institutional use of intensive regimens ranged from
14%-50%], and tumor size), as well as age, HR status,

grade, and LVI. For patients treated with non-intensive
chemotherapy regimens, the choice between the TC versus AC regimens was significantly influenced by age, year,
and reporting center. There was an increase in the use of
TC over time (OR, 3.53 per year of diagnosis; 95% CI,
2.71-4.59), with significant center variability (compared
with center A, the OR of receiving TC vs AC chemotherapy ranged from 0.07-2.36 [P<.001], with the unadjusted institutional use of TC ranging from 18%-79%).
Among patients with HR-positive disease, exploratory
analyses suggested that Oncotype Dx RS may be associated with treatment received; in particular, patients with
higher scores were significantly more likely to receive intensive regimens (Table 4). However, we were unable to
determine whether the association was independent of
other factors due to collinearity between the Oncotype Dx
RS and tumor grade.

Costs

We found significant cost variability (Fig. 5). In 2006, the
drug cost of trastuzumab-based regimens was primarily
driven by the use of trastuzumab (1 year of trastuzumab
treatment exceeded $45,000). The cost of using a non-intensive strategy such as paclitaxel with trastuzumab was
$46,178, whereas the costs of intensive regimens such as
1944

TCH or ACTH were $58,115 and $47,062, respectively.
When comparing the drug cost of non–trastuzumabbased regimens, the differences were mainly driven by the
use of pegfilgastrim and docetaxel. Among non-intensive
strategies, 4 cycles of AC cost $346 and 4 cycles of TC
cost $17,383. Among intensive strategies, 8 cycles of
dose-dense doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel

(ACHT) ACT cost $19,213 and 6 cycles of the combination of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel
cost $26,378.
The estimates for 2009 were similar; however, with
docetaxel at that point available as a generic drug, there
were no longer significant price differences noted among
trastuzumab-based regimens and among non–
trastuzumab-based regimens; rather, these differences
were now mainly driven by the use of growth factor support. For example, there was an 8-fold to 12-fold price
difference when comparing regimens such as AC or AC
followed by weekly paclitaxel with regimens such as TC,
dose-dense ACT, or the combination of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel.
DISCUSSION
Previously, we demonstrated a strong increase in chemotherapy use among patients with T1abN0 breast cancers
who are treated at NCCN institutions.4 In the current
study, we extended this work to include patients with
T1cN0 tumors and analyze factors associated with the
choice of intensive versus non-intensive regimens and the
costs of different chemotherapy regimens. Among nearly
9000 women presenting with stage I breast cancer, we
documented an increased use of intensive chemotherapy
over the last decade and a substantial decline in the use of
anthracycline-based regimens. We observed striking institutional variations with regard to the choice of chemotherapy, variations that were of a greater magnitude than
clinicopathological factors. We also found a substantial
variation in costs, particularly among non–trastuzumabbased regimens, which varied by >75-fold, with the use of
growth factor support being the major driver of this
variation.
We noted an increase in the use of intensive regimens over time, most notably among patients with
TNBC and HER2-positive disease.
As expected, we found that, among patients with
TNBC, a higher percentage of patients with T1c tumors
received intensive regimens compared with those with
T1ab tumors (29% of patients with T1a disease, 21% of
patients with T1b disease, and 39% of patients with T1c
disease); we also found that over time there was an
increase in the use of intensive regimens among this
patient population (59% of patients with TNBC in 2008
through 2009).Prior meta-analyses demonstrated that the
incorporation of taxanes into an anthracycline regimen
results in a 16% relative reduction in the risk of disease recurrence, which translated into an absolute gain in
recurrence-free survival of 4.6%.6,15 However, the major1946

ity of adjuvant clinical trials either excluded women with
stage I disease entirely or only included a small percentage
of such women.6 Therefore, the absolute benefit derived
from the use of more intensive regimens among this
patient population is based largely on extrapolation,6 raising the question of the appropriate threshold at which to
incorporate taxanes in patients with high-risk biology but
lower-risk anatomic stage, given the added toxicities and
costs incurred.
Among patients with HER2-positive disease, by the
period between 2008 and 2009, the majority of patients
were also treated with intensive regimens (63%), and the
majority received TCH. The overwhelming efficacy of
anti-HER2 therapies has raised hopes that for patients
with lymph node-negative tumors, less chemotherapy
may be appropriate if combined with trastuzumab.
Recent prospective data evaluating a non-intensive regimen, paclitaxel with trastuzumab, in approximately 400
patients with lymph node-negative, HER2-positive breast
cancer demonstrated a 3-year disease-free survival estimate of 98%.16 Given the favorable toxicity profile of the
combination of paclitaxel and trastuzumab, these data
highlight the large number of women who could be
spared potential side effects if the combination of paclitaxel and trastuzumab is adopted as standard of care in the
treatment of stage I HER2-positive breast cancer in lieu of
ACTH or TCH.
In the current study, we also observed a significant
decline in the use of anthracycline-based chemotherapy
within NCCN institutions over time. This is consistent
with data from Giordano et al, which showed declines in
anthracycline use across the United States.5
Not surprisingly, apart from the time trend
described, treatment choices were found to be influenced
by tumor characteristics (HR, size, grade, and LVI; exploratory analyses also suggested that among patients with
HER2-negative/HR-positive tumors, Oncotype Dx RS
may impact treatment choice). In addition, we also identified a very strong institutional influence in treatment
choice. For example, the institutional use of intensive regimens ranged from 42% to 90% in patients with HER2positive tumors and from 14% to 50% in patients with
HER2-negative tumors and the institutional use of TC
ranged from 18% to 79%. The majority of guidelines
regarding adjuvant chemotherapy endorse several possible
regimens.10,17 The data from the current study suggest
that when reasonable treatment uncertainty exists, institutional culture tends to drive patterns of care.
In the United States alone, >100,000 women are
diagnosed with stage I breast cancer each year.18 In an era
Cancer

of increasing scrutiny of the cost-effectiveness of therapy
and attention to toxicity and quality of life, the current
study data point to large gaps of knowledge with which to
guide the care of patients with stage I breast cancer. For
example, moving from 4 cycles of AC administered every
3 weeks to dose-dense ACT results in a 50-fold increase in
costs, primarily due to the need for growth factor support.
This trend was observed in a substantial number of
patients with HER2-negative breast cancer; however, to
the best of our knowledge, the incremental benefit in this
patient population, particularly among patients with
T1ab tumors, remains poorly described. In the setting of
HER2-positive disease, multiple new biologic agents (eg,
pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine) are being developed. Although undoubtedly there is great potential for
these agents to improve cure rates, they will add cost, and
the question of cost-effectiveness relative to current regimens will be a key question in the setting of stage I disease,
in which the prognosis is already excellent.
We acknowledge several limitations of the current
study. It was limited to patients who presented to academic centers, and thus may not capture changes in treatment strategies in the community, in which the majority
of cancer care is delivered. Nevertheless, many of the
trends observed have similarly been observed in
population-based data.5 We classified regimens on an
ever/never basis and did not address dose or scheduling.
The reasons for treatment selection and changes were not
available. The database does not capture detailed toxicity
data nor did patients report outcomes. The classification
of HER2 and HR status was based on the standards used
in each center applicable at the time of diagnosis. In particular, the possibility of some differences in the interpretation of HR status over time exists, particularly in cases
with low-level (<10%) expression. Because of a small
sample size among patients with HER2-negative/HRpositive disease, we could not examine the independent
influence of Oncotype Dx RS on the type of chemotherapy received. Caution should also be used when citing
overall patterns because changes in practice occurred during the study period (introduction of Oncotype Dx RS,
use of trastuzumab). Finally, the cost calculation was
based only on drug costs, not on capturing metrics such as
the number of visits or infusion time.
The results of the current study demonstrate an
intensification of treatment and an increase in the use of
taxane-based regimens, with a concomitant decrease in
the use of anthracyclines among patients with stage I
breast cancer. These results also demonstrated a high instiCancer

tutional and cost variability. These results highlight the
need for dedicated studies among the growing number of
patients with small lymph node-negative breast cancer.
