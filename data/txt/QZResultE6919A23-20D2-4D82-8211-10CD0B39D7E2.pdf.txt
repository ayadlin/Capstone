Abstract
Although targeting the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway remains a promising anticancer strategy, mitogen-activated
protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitors in clinical development are likely to
be limited in their ability to produce durable clinical responses due to the emergence of acquired drug resistance.
To identify potential mechanisms of such resistance, we established MEK inhibitor–resistant clones of human
HT-29 colon cancer cells (HT-29R cells) that harbor the B-Raf V600E mutation. HT-29R cells were specifically
resistant to MEK inhibition in vitro and in vivo, with drug-induced elevation of MEK/ERK and their downstream
targets primarily accountable for drug resistance. We identified MEK1(F129L) mutation as a molecular
mechanism responsible for MEK/ERK pathway activation. In an isogenic cell system that extended these
findings into other cancer cell lines, the MEK1(F129L) mutant exhibited higher intrinsic kinase activity than
wild-type MEK1 [MEK1(WT)], leading to potent activation of ERK and downstream targets. The MEK1(F129L)
mutation also strengthened binding to c-Raf, suggesting an underlying mechanism of higher intrinsic kinase
activity. Notably, the combined use of Raf and MEK inhibitors overcame the observed drug resistance and
exhibited greater synergy in HT-29R cells than the drug-sensitive HT-29 parental cells. Overall, our findings
suggested that mutations in MEK1 can lead to acquired resistance in patients treated with MEK inhibitors and
that a combined inhibition of Raf and MEK may be potentially useful as a strategy to bypass or prevent drug
resistance in the clinic. Cancer Res; 71(16); 5535–45. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Current cancer drug development is evolving toward treatment with molecularly targeted agents, driven by the discovery of genetic alterations in cancer and the signaling pathways
they alter. In some patients with cancers driven by a "driver"
oncogene, targeted therapies have shown remarkable
improvements in clinical response and survival. Successful
examples include imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia
with BCR-ABL translocation (1, 2) and in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors with activating c-KIT or platelet-derived
growth factor receptor mutation (3), gefitinib and erlotinib

in non–small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring an activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (4),
and trastuzumab in breast cancer with Her-2 amplification (5).
On the other hand, the rapid acquisition of drug resistance
often limits the overall therapeutic impact. This highlights the
need for greater understanding of intrinsic (de novo) or
acquired resistance mechanisms of the targeted therapy.
Oncogenic Ras and B-Raf mutations frequently occur in
human tumors. Ras mutations are found in approximately
30% of human tumors (6). B-Raf mutations also occur in
many cancers, with the highest incidence in melanoma
(60%–70%; ref. 7). Ras or B-Raf mutations lead to aberrant
activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal cascade that
correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis (8).
The Ras/Raf/MEK pathway components have therefore
become attractive targets for cancer therapy. Many new
agents have entered human clinical trials targeting Raf or
MEK [mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase]. RG7204/PLX4032 (vemurafenib),
an orally selective B-Raf inhibitor, exhibits impressive antitumor activity in B-RafV600E mutant metastatic melanomas
(9, 10) and significantly improved patient survival (2011
ASCO). A companion diagnostic test to select B-RafV600E
mutant tumors is necessary (11–14). Highly selective MEK

inhibitors (GSK1120212, AZD6244, GDC-0973/XL518, and
RO4987655) evaluated in early clinical studies may provide
benefit in a broader patient population carrying B-Raf wildtype (WT) or Ras mutant tumors. To date, the observed
clinical response for MEK inhibitors as single agents has
been encouraging but limited (15–17). This likely resulted
from potent MEK inhibition in normal cells leading to a
narrow therapeutic window. Limited durable efficacy of
MEK inhibitors may also result from de novo or drugacquired resistance in cancers due to complicated signaling
pathway cross-talk and compensatory feedback regulation.
Thus, it is important to have a better understanding of the
molecular mechanism underlying acquired resistance. In
this study, we established the colorectal cancer cell (HT29R) clones resistant to MEK inhibition by chronically
exposing HT-29 cells to RO4927350, a highly selective
MEK inhibitor (18). HT-29 parental cells harbor B-Raf V600E
mutation and are highly sensitive to MEK inhibition. We
compared molecular profiles of sensitive cells (HT-29S) and
resistant cells (HT-29R) to reveal potential molecular
mechanisms underlying MEK inhibitor acquired resistance
leading to a rational therapeutic strategy to overcome such
resistance.

control clones were selected by the same single-cell subclonal
procedure in the absence of the drug.
Sequencing of B-Raf, c-Raf, MEK1, and MEK2 DNA
Genomic DNAs were isolated using the Qiagen DNeasy
Blood & Tissue Kit. All 18 coding exons of B-Raf, 11 coding
exons of MEK1, and c-RAF coding exons 10 to 14 were
PCR-amplified with designed primers and bidirectionally
sequenced by Genewiz DNA sequencing Services using
Sanger's method. The coding exon 2, exon 3, exon 5, and exon
6 of MEK2 were sequenced internally using the following
primer sets: CTTGAGGTCCTGAGGTCTGC (forward) and GCCTGGAGCTAATCAGAATGC (reverse) for exon 2, TTGGTCTTGACCACTGTTGG (forward) and AGAAGGATCCCCTGGAAGC
(reverse) for exon 3, CAGCACTGTCTCGTCTCTGG (forward)
and GAGAACTGGGAGGGACAGC (reverse) for exons 5 and 6.
Western blot analysis and cell viability assays in vitro
Western blotting and MTT assays were carried out as
previously described (18). The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell
viability assays (Promega) were carried out according to the
manufacturer's instruction. For combination MTT assays,
cells were simultaneously treated with various concentrations
of 2 agents at a fixed ratio across a range of activities. Cell
viability was evaluated after 5 days by the MTT assay. The
isobologram and combination index (CI) were calculated
according to the Chou and Talalay median effect principal,
using Calcusyn software version 2 (Biosoft). The computed
isobologram is a graphical representation of the 2-agent
interaction and is formed by plotting the individual drug
doses required to achieve a single-agent effect on their
respective x and y axes; a line connecting the 2 points is
drawn. Combination data points that fall on, above, or below
the line represent additive, antagonism, or synergy, respectively. The calculated CI values provide a qualitative measure
of the degree of drug interaction in terms of additive effect
(CI ¼ 1), synergism (CI < 1), or antagonism (CI > 1) for a given
endpoint of the effect measurement such as EC50 or EC90.
Plasmid constructs and transfection
Human full-length MEK1(WT) and mutant MEK1(F129L)
expression vectors were cloned into vector pCMV6 with mycDDK tag at its C-terminus (from Origene). The mutation of
MEK1(F129L) was generated by mutagenesis changing C387 to
A and was confirmed by sequencing. HEK293 cells were
transfected with MEK1(WT) or MEK1(F129L) expression vector, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Immunoprecipitation–Western blot analysis
Cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged MEK1(WT) or
MEK1(F129L) plasmids with or without B-RafV600E cotransfection. After 48 hours, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitation (IP) was carried out using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel
(Sigma). Immune complexes were analyzed by Western
blotting. For in vitro kinase assays, the bound protein was
eluted with FLAG peptides, and the FLAG-tagged proteins
[MEK1(WT) or MEK1(F129L)] were analyzed by Western
blotting and quantified by measuring band density against

various concentrations of FLAG standard loaded on the
same gel.
In vitro kinase assays and compound IC50
determination by IMAP assay
MEK kinase activity was determined by immobilized
metal ion affinity-based fluorescence polarization (IMAP)
assay as previously described (18). In brief, kinase buffer
containing 55 nmol/L MEK1(WT) or MEK1(F129L) with
or without 3 nmol/L c-Raf, 90.5 nmol/L inactive ERK,
0.5 mmol/L fluorescein isothiocyanate–labeled ERK substrate peptide, and various concentrations of compound
in the presence of 50 mmol/L ATP were added into the assay
plate and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. The plate was
incubated at 37 C for 20 minutes for MEK activation in
the presence of c-Raf. The percentage of activity and the IC50
values of compounds were calculated.

Results
Establishment of colorectal cancer cell clones (HT-29R)
with acquired resistance to the highly selective MEK
inhibitor RO4927350 in vitro and in vivo
The HT-29 colorectal cancer cell line was previously shown
to harbor the B-Raf V600E mutation and is highly sensitive to
MEK inhibition (18, 19). To explore potential mechanisms of
drug-acquired resistance, we exposed HT-29 cells to gradually
increasing concentrations of the allosteric MEK inhibitor
RO4927350. After 10 months, surviving cells were subcloned
to establish RO4927350-resistant cells (HT-29R), which were
subsequently maintained in the presence of 5 mmol/L
RO4927350. The control sensitive cells (HT-29S) were subcloned in the absence of the MEK inhibitor. HT-29S and HT29R cells (5 clones from each category) were treated with
various concentrations (0.37–10 mmol/L) of the MEK inhibitor
RO4927350 for 24 to 120 hours, and representative results are
shown in Fig. 1. RO4927350 inhibited HT-29S9 cell growth in a
dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A),
whereas HT-29R1 cells showed significant resistance to
RO4927350 (Fig. 1B).

In vivo efficacy studies in xenograft tumor models
In vivo testing was done as previously described (19).
Briefly, HT-29 cancer cells were implanted s.c. in nude mice.
Once the xenograft tumors reached a mean tumor volume
of approximately 100 to 200 mm3, mice were randomized
to treatment groups (n ¼ 10 per group) and received either
vehicle or the compounds at the indicated dose. RO4927350
was formulated as a fine suspension containing 0.09%
methyl paraben, 0.01% propyl paraben, 2.0% Klucel LF,
and 0.1% polysorbate 80 in purified water and given orally
twice daily for approximately 3 weeks. Irinotecan was

To confirm that in vitro generated HT-29R clones remain
resistant to MEK inhibition in vivo, we established xenograft
tumors derived from sensitive and resistant clones and monitored their tumor growth kinetics (data not shown). We
selected 2 representative clones with similar tumor growth
kinetics (HT-29S9 and HT-29R1) and carried out in vivo efficacy
studies using MEK inhibitor RO4927350 and irinotecan (Fig. 1C
and D). RO4927350, when administered orally at 100 mg/kg
twice daily for 3 weeks, effectively inhibited HT-29S9 xenograft
tumor growth resulting in statistically significant tumor
growth inhibition (TGI; 85% TGI, P < 0.001) compared with
vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 1C). In contrast, HT-29R1 xenograft tumors treated with RO4927350, using the same treatment dose and schedule, resulted in only 36% TGI (P ¼ 0.003;
Fig. 1D). Irinotecan, when administered i.p. at 60 mg/kg every
4 days, resulted in equivalent statistically significant tumor
growth inhibition (P < 0.001) in both models (88% TGI in
HT-29S9 and 82% in HT-29R1; Fig. 1C and D). No body weight
loss was observed in mice from any treatment group (data not
shown).
HT-29R clones are resistant to a wide range of Raf/MEK
inhibitors
To further examine whether HT-29R clones are cross-resistant to other cancer therapeutic agents, we treated HT-29S
and HT-29R cells (2 representative clones from each category)
with various agents including MEK inhibitors (RO4927350,
RO4987655, and PD0325901), Raf inhibitors (PLX4720, RG7204,
and sorafenib), paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and irinotecan. Cell
proliferation was analyzed, and average IC50 and IC90 values of
each agent were determined (Table 1). In comparison with

HT-29S clones, HT-29R clones exhibited significantly reduced
sensitivity to all MEK inhibitors (RO4927350, RO4987655, and
PD0325901) with diversified chemical structures (15, 18, 20,
21), with increased average IC50 values ranging from 29- to
65-fold. HT-29R clones displayed 10- or 13-fold increased IC50
to the highly selective Raf inhibitors PLX4720 or RG7204,
respectively. Interestingly, Raf inhibitors produced minimal
change in IC90 (RG7204) or maximal effective concentration
(PLX4720), suggesting that the HT-29R cells are cross-resistant to Raf inhibition at a lower concentration range, but the
sensitivity can be restored at higher drug levels. However, we
cannot completely rule out off-target effects at higher concentrations because PLX4720 and RG7204 are ATP-competitive Raf inhibitors. On the other hand, HT-29R and HT-29S
clones showed equivalent sensitivity (less than 2-fold difference in both IC50 and IC90) to sorafenib, a nonselective Raf
inhibitor, and other agents with different mechanisms of
action (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and irinotecan; Table 1).
These results show that HT-29R clones are specifically resistant to MEK/Raf inhibition, suggesting that the acquired
resistance mechanism is likely involved in pathway specific
dysregulation.
Acquired resistance to MEK inhibition is associated
with an elevation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activity
To understand how the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is dysregulated in HT-29R cells, we profiled sensitive and resistant
clones to examine pathway component expression and activation. Representative results are shown in Fig. 2A. The protein
expression levels of key components including Ras, B-Raf,
c-Raf, MEK, and ERK were not significantly elevated (less
than 1.5-fold) in resistant clones compared with sensitive
clones. On the other hand, the MEK/ERK pathway activity
was highly elevated in HT-29R clones compared with HT-29S
clones as evidenced by the significant increase in the phosphorylation levels of MEK, ERK, and their downstream targets
(RSK, MNK, BAD, CREB, S6 RP; Fig. 2A). Pathway activation
was also observed in the in vivo xenograft tumors derived from
a resistant clone (HT-29R1) showing increased levels of
p-MEK, p-ERK, p-RSK, p-MNK, p-BAD, p-S6 RP, and DUSP6
and DUSP10 (known ERK downstream target genes) compared with the xenograft tumors derived from a sensitive
clone (HT-29S9; Fig. 2B). All resistant clones tested showed
significantly elevated MEK/ERK and downstream pathway
activation (Supplementary Fig. S1). The elevation is likely
occurring at or below the level of Raf within the Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK signaling cascade. When we carried out phospho–
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array analysis (R&D Systems)
to simultaneously detect the relative tyrosine phosphorylation levels of 42 different RTKs in both HT-29S and HT-29R
clones, none of these RTK phosphorylation levels were found
elevated in HT-29R (data not shown). We also confirmed that
neither basal nor stimulated levels of Ras activity were altered
in HT-29R (data not shown). Moreover, the IP-kinase assays
showed that B-Raf activity was not significantly different
between HT-29R and HT-29S (data not shown). The c-Raf
activity was barely detectable by IP-kinase assays, and phosphorylated c-Raf (Ser338) in all clones (R and S) was barely

detectable, which is consistent with previous findings that cRaf activity is very low in B-RafV600E cancer lines (22). These
results show that acquired resistance to MEK inhibition is
associated with a significant elevation of MEK/ERK pathway
activity without alteration in upstream component (Ras/Raf)
expression (Fig. 2A) or Ras GTPase and Raf kinase activities
(data not shown).
An activating mutation MEK1(F129L) was identified in
HT-29R cells
To understand the underlying mechanism for pathway
elevation in HT-29R cells, we profiled HT-29R versus HT29S to identify potential genetic alterations. We carried out
full exome sequencing of B-Raf, c-Raf, MEK1, and MEK2 in
representative sensitive and resistant clones (5 clones from
each category). No additional B-Raf mutations were found and
no c-Raf and MEK2 mutations were detected (data not shown)
in HT-29R cells. Interestingly, we identified a single-nucleotide
change (C387A) resulting in amino acid substitution F129L
(Fig. 3A) within the MEK1 allosteric drug-binding pocket (23,
24) in 2 clones (R1 and R9). To examine the potential impact of
mutant MEK1(F129L) on MEK inhibition, R1 and R9 cells were
treated with various concentrations of RO4927350, the p-ERK
levels were examined by Western blotting, and EC50 values
were determined. As shown in Fig. 3B, the elevated ERK
activities in the R1 cells required about 10-fold higher concentrations of RO4927350 for MEK inhibition than the S9 cells.
A similar fold resistance was seen in R9 clone (data not

(F129L) mutation plus other accumulated known/unknown
genetic alterations in cancer cells, to further assess the MEK1
(F129L) activity and its impact on MEK inhibition in an
isogenic system, we transiently expressed MEK1(WT) or
mutant MEK1(F129L) in human embryonic kidney
(HEK293) cells in which the endogenous MEK/ERK pathway
activity is very low. When MEK1(WT) and MEK1(F129L) were
expressed at comparable levels, a significant elevation of pERK1/2 levels (7-fold increase) was observed in MEK1(F129L)expressing cells compared with MEK1(WT) cells (Fig. 4A).
MEK1(F129L) also activated the downstream signals [p-RSK
(S380), p-p85/p70 S6 kinase (T421/S424), and p-S6 RP (S235/
S236); Fig. 4A]. When both transfectants [MEK1(WT) or MEK1
(F129L)] were treated with the MEK inhibitor RO4927350, the
elevated p-ERK in MEK1(F129L) cells was suppressed by
RO4927350 but higher concentrations were required
(Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the MEK1(F129L) mutation may be an activating mutation increasing downstream
signaling requiring higher drug concentrations for inhibition.
MEK1(F129L) exhibits higher intrinsic kinase activity,
binds c-Raf more strongly compared with MEK1(WT),
and confers resistance to MEK inhibition
To validate MEK1(F129L) as an activating mutation, we
directly measured kinase activity of the purified MEK1(F129L)
proteins in a cell-free system. The FLAG-tagged MEK1(WT)
and MEK1(F129L) proteins were purified from HEK293 transfectants by using an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. Total levels of
purified FLAG-tagged MEK1(WT) and MEK1(F129L) were

comparable, but p-MEK levels were significantly higher in the
F129L preparation (Fig. 4C, top). Enzyme activities of MEK1
(WT) and MEK1(F129L) were measured in vitro in a cell-free
system by quantitating the phosphorylation of ERK peptide by
the IMAP assay. Furthermore, we examined the dose–
response effect of the MEK inhibitor (RO4987655) on MEK1
(WT) or MEK1(F129L) with or without the addition of c-Raf
(Fig. 4C, bottom). In the absence of c-Raf, MEK1(WT) showed
negligible basal enzyme activity whereas MEK1(F129L) displayed higher basal enzyme activity than MEK1(WT) correlating with observed higher p-MEK levels within MEK1(F129L)
(Fig. 4C, top). Basal activity of MEK1(F129L) can be suppressed by a MEK inhibitor with only a minor increase
(2-fold) in IC50 value as compared with MEK1(WT). In
the presence of c-Raf, MEK1(WT) and MEK1(F129L) showed
equivalent enzyme activities; however, MEK1(F129L) was
more resistant to MEK inhibition than MEK1(WT), with
approximately 7-fold-increased IC50 value observed. These
results show that the MEK1(F129L) mutation possesses
higher intrinsic kinase activity leading to resistance to MEK
inhibition.
In MEK1(F129L)-expressing cells, levels of total c-Raf and
phosphorylated c-Raf (S338) are not changed as compared
with MEK1(WT) (Fig. 4D and data not shown). To further
understand the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for increased activity of MEK1(F129L), we analyzed MEK1
and Raf complex formation in cells. When comparable levels
of WT or F129L MEK1 were expressed in HEK293 cells with or
without B-RafV600E coexpression (Fig. 4D), MEK1(F129L)
significantly activated ERK phosphorylation, although somewhat less than observed with B-RafV600E (Fig. 4D, top). MEK1

complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and Raf/MEK levels were examined by Western blotting.
Increased levels of c-Raf were immunoprecipitated with MEK1
(F129L) compared with MEK1(WT) regardless of B-RafV600E
coexpression. The immunoprecipitated B-Raf was comparable
between MEK1(WT) and MEK1(F129L) (Fig. 4D, bottom).
These results suggest that the increased intrinsic kinase
activity of MEK1(F129L) may be due to its stronger binding
affinity to c-Raf that leads to a sustained MEK activation.
To confirm these findings in cancer cell lines natively
harboring the B-Raf V600E mutation, MEK1(WT) and MEK1
(F129L) were expressed in A375 melanoma cells. Comparable
levels of MEK1(WT) and MEK1(F129L) were expressed
(detected by anti-FLAG, anti-MEK1, and anti-p-MEK1/2 antibodies, Fig. 5A, bottom). The MEK1(F129L) specifically
induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, top), bound more cRaf but not B-Raf (Fig. 5B), and displayed significant resistance
to MEK inhibition, as evidenced by a 10-fold increase in the
IC50 (Fig. 5C and D). Similar results were observed in LOX
melanoma and MDA-MB-435 cancer cells carrying the
B-RafV600E mutation (data not shown).
Combined inhibition of MEK and B-Raf overcomes
resistance exhibiting greater synergy in HT-29R cells
To determine whether the combination of Raf and MEK
inhibition could overcome MEK1(F129L) conferred resistance,
we carried out combination studies using the MEK inhibitor
RO4987655 and the Raf inhibitor RG7204 in HT-29S9 and HT29R1 cells. Cell viability was measured in the presence of each
agent alone or in combination. The results were analyzed by
CalcuSyn software and displayed as simulated isobolograms

MEK and Raf inhibitors (RO4927350 and PLX4720, data not
shown). Correspondingly, the combination treatment with
MEK and Raf inhibitors (at concentrations resulting in
>90% growth inhibition) more effectively suppressed
p-MEK, p-ERK, and downstream signal cyclin D1 in both
sensitive and resistant cells (Fig. 6C). Together, our results
indicate that the combination of Raf and MEK inhibition could
be a potential therapeutic strategy not only to enhance clinical
efficacy but also to bypass or prevent drug-acquired resistance
in B-RafV600E patients treated with MEK or Raf inhibitors.

Discussion
Acquired drug resistance remains the major challenge to
targeted cancer therapy that leads to patient relapse with
limited survival benefit (25). Therefore, it is important to
identify mechanisms underlying acquired resistance. By continuously exposing cancer cells to a highly selective anticancer
agent in vitro over a period of time, the majority of cells are
eliminated and only drug-resistant clones are expanded. This
is an experimental strategy that has been successfully used to
identify MET amplification as a mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitor in NSCLC (26), and c-Raf
overexpression as a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to B-Raf inhibitor in melanoma (27). In this study, we
established a cell model system (HT-29R) resistant to MEK
and Raf inhibitors by using the same approach. HT-29R was
derived from the chronic exposure of HT-29 colorectal cells to
a highly selective MEK inhibitor, RO4927350. HT-29 cells
harboring the B-Raf V600E mutation are originally sensitive
to MEK inhibition (18, 19). By comparative profiling of sensi-

tive and resistant clones, we reveal a significant elevation of
MEK/ERK and downstream signaling consistent with the
acquired resistance to MEK inhibition. Moreover, we identified a MEK1(F129L) mutation located within the allosteric
binding pocket that exhibits elevated intrinsic kinase activity
leading to a significant elevation of Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
signaling conferring resistance to MEK inhibition. We further
showed that this mutation stabilizes the MEK/c-Raf complex
formation, a possible mechanism underlying the elevated
MEK1(F129L) activity. Combination inhibition of Raf and
MEK could overcome the resistance exhibiting greater synergy
in the resistant cells. This study suggests that the MEK1
mutation could be a potential drug-acquired resistance
mechanism emerging in MEK inhibitor–treated cancer
patients.
Somatic mutations in MEK1 and MEK2 have thus far not
been reported in human cancers except a heterozygous missense substitution MEK1(D67N) that was identified in an
ovarian cancer cell line (28). Germline mutations, including
F53S and Y130C MEK1 and F57C MEK2, are the first naturally
occurring MEK mutations identified in patients with cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome (29). These germline mutations remain sensitive to MEK and Raf inhibition (30). By
carrying out a random mutagenesis screen, Emery and colleagues reported that many artificial MEK1 mutations situated
within the allosteric drug binding pocket or a-helix C showed
robust resistance to MEK inhibition (31). In addition, they
showed that other MEK mutations located within the Nterminal negative regulatory helix (A), similar to the germline
mutations reported in CFC, also confer resistance to MEK
inhibition. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified

in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma
patient treated with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244. We provide
experimental evidence to show that the MEK1(F129L) mutation within the allosteric binding pocket occurs after longterm treatment with a MEK inhibitor in B-RafV600E colorectal
cancer cells, leading to increased intrinsic MEK1 activation
and resistance to MEK inhibition. We further show that the

(F129L) activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of
altered Raf/MEK complex formation leading to a functional
impact on the pathway activity. It is intriguing to find phenylalanine (F)-to-leucine (L) substitution on MEK1, a fairly
conserved mutation from a structural point of view with
minimal physical property changes in size and charge, significantly enhances its intrinsic kinase activity and activates
downstream signals. While this manuscript was under review,
a new study reported that the MEK1(C121S) mutation was

found in a patient with melanoma who developed resistance
to the Raf inhibitor PLX4032 after an initial dramatic response
(32).
All resistant clones tested showed significant MEK/ERK
pathway elevation. It will be interesting to identify alternative
molecular mechanisms in HT-29R clones without MEK1 mutation. Thus far, we were unable to identify any changes of RTK,
Ras, and Raf activities in HT-29R clones without MEK1 mutation. Negative regulators of the MEK/ERK pathway such as
various phosphatases would be the best candidates for further
investigation. It is well known that many levels of cross-talk
occur between the MEK/ERK and the phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. We analyzed phosphorylation
levels of key PI3K pathway components (AKT, 4E-BP, mTOR)
and found that phosphorylation of mTOR (S2448, S2481) was
significantly elevated in HT-29R cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
mTOR is autophosphorylated at Ser2481 and phosphorylated
at Ser2448 via both PI3K/AKT and/or p70 S6 kinase signaling
pathways (33, 34). Interestingly, p-mTOR (S2448) is significantly higher in HT-29R (1 and 9) carrying the MEK1(F129L)
mutation. We showed that MEK1(F129L) induced p70 S6
kinase activity (Fig. 4). It has been reported that p70 S6 kinase
is a major effector of mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 (34).
These results suggest that MEK1(F129L) induces p70 S6 kinase
activation leading to the elevation of p-mTOR (S2448). Elevated mTOR phosphorylation in HT-29R cells is an interesting
molecular mechanism for further investigation of the MEK
and mTOR pathway cross-talk.
The Raf inhibitor PLX4032/RG7204 exhibits impressive
antitumor activity in B-RafV600E mutant metastatic melanomas with a remarkable response rate. On the other hand,
antitumor efficacy is less promising in colorectal cancer
patients bearing the same B-Raf mutation (35), which serves
as a reminder of the complexity of cancer; nonetheless,
RG7204 may offer hope for colorectal cancer patients as
part of combination therapy. Combination of Raf and MEK
inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy (32).
Here, we show that the MEK inhibitor–resistant lines are
cross-resistant to the highly selective Raf inhibitors
PLX4720/PLX4032 but not sorafenib, a nonselective c-Raf
inhibitor. This is not unexpected, as sorafenib is characterized as a multikinase inhibitor and its antitumor activity is
mainly driven by targeting KDR, Flt-3, etc., to suppress
angiogenesis. Inhibition of c-Raf by sorafenib is not suffi-

cient to suppress B-RafV600E cancer cell growth. Our study
further implies that combination targeting of Raf and MEK
not only broadens the patient population but also provides
benefit in preventing or bypassing single drug-acquired
resistance.
PI3K/PTEN pathway mutation in tumors significantly
affects their sensitivity to MEK or Raf inhibitors. Combination
targeting of Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways
has been reported in many preclinical models (36, 37). For a
comparative analysis, we carried out combination studies of
MEK and PI3K inhibitors by using RO4927350 and PI-103 in
HT-29S and HT-29R cells, in which a synergistic effect was
observed in both sensitive and resistant clones, unlike the
combination of Raf and MEK inhibitors, comparable CI values
were seen (data not shown) consistent with the lack of
elevation of p-AKT and p-4E-BP1 levels in HT-29R cells
compared with HT-29S cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Our data support the need to monitor MEK1 mutation in
the clinic during MEK inhibitor treatment, as these may
indicate that drug-acquired resistance is occurring in the
tumor. RO4987655 is in early clinical development (21). We
examined MEK1 exon sequences in 4 archived predose tumors
from melanoma and colorectal cancer patients, and as
expected, there was no mutation found (data not shown).
In the future, it will be interesting to validate our preclinical
observations by examining whether MEK1 mutation can be
found in patients relapsing following treatment with MEK
inhibitors. Combination therapy targeting Raf and MEK may
be applied accordingly.
