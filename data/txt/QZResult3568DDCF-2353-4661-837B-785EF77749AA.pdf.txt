develop novel therapeutic alternatives and overcome the drugresistant phenotype of the majority of these tumors. However, the
critical molecular alterations and signaling pathways that drive
gastric tumorigenesis remain largely uncharacterized.
A comprehensive molecular analysis of the 17q12 amplicon in
gastric cancer has led to identification of dopamine and cyclic AMP
(cAMP)–regulated phosphoprotein of M r 32,000 (Darpp-32) as the
critical target gene in the region (7, 8). We have identified a truncated
isoform of Darpp-32, t-Darpp, as a novel gene that is expressed in
cancer (8). t-Darpp is overexpressed in several common adenocarcinomas, such as those of the colon, esophagus, breast, and prostate
(9–14). We have reported that overexpression of t-Darpp provides
antiapoptotic potential to cancer cells in a p53-independent
mechanism (15). However, the biological role and molecular
signaling of t-Darpp in carcinogenesis remain largely unexplored.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway
regulates fundamental cellular processes linked to tumorigenesis,
including cell cycle progression; cell survival, adhesion, motility,
and spreading; angiogenesis; glucose homeostasis; and cell and
organ size control (16, 17). Recent reports have indicated that
activation of Akt pathway is implicated in conferring resistance to
conventional chemotherapy and multiple chemotherapeutic agents
(5-fluorouracil, Adriamycin, mitomycin C, and cisplatinum) on
cancer cells (18). Akt is hyperactivated in a wide range of human
tumors as a result of constitutive activation of growth receptors,
mutation of PI3K, and inactivation or loss of PTEN phosphatase
(19). The majority of tumors with hyperactive Akt signaling have as
few as 3 to 20% identifiable PI3K mutations (20–23). In gastric
carcinomas, PI3K mutations are rare and tend to occur as isolated
events in microsatellite instability tumors (24–26). Although Akt
activation plays an important role in cancer cell survival, there is
limited information regarding the regulation of this signaling
cascade in gastric cancer.
The pro-survival Bcl2 family members, such as Bcl-xL and Bcl2,
are overexpressed in several malignancies and promote tumor
progression and resistance to therapy (27–30). The Bcl2 family
proteins are pivotal regulators of apoptotic cell death that are
considered as attractive targets for drug design (31). Bcl2 is mainly a
mitochondrial membrane protein, and its overexpression inhibits
cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9. It also prevents
cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to several stress stimuli
(27, 32, 33). In a mouse model lymphoblastic leukemia, suppression
of Bcl2 expression resulted in rapid loss of leukemic cells and significantly prolonged survival, indicating that Bcl2 may be a potential
target for cancer therapy (34). In this study, we have investigated
the role of t-Darpp in regulating Akt and bcl2 in gastric cancer cells.

Abstract
t-Darpp is a cancer-related truncated isoform of Darpp-32
(dopamine and cyclic-AMP–regulated phosphoprotein of M r
32,000). We detected overexpression of t-Darpp mRNA in
two thirds of gastric cancers compared with normal samples
(P = 0.004). Using 20 Mmol/L ceramide treatment as a model
for induction of apoptosis in AGS cancer cells, we found that
expression of t-Darpp led to an increase in Bcl2 protein levels
and blocked the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. The
MitoCapture mitochondrial apoptosis and cytochrome c
release assays indicated that t-Darpp expression enforces the
mitochondrial transmembrane potential and protects against
ceramide-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the expression of
t-Darpp in AGS cells led to z2-fold increase in Akt kinase
activity with an increase in protein levels of p-Ser473 Akt
and p-Ser9 GSK3B. These findings were further confirmed
using tetracycline-inducible AGS cells stably expressing
t-Darpp. We also showed transcriptional up-regulation of
Bcl2 using the luciferase assay with Bcl2 reporter containing
P1 full promoter, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and
t-Darpp small interfering RNA. The Bcl2 promoter contains
binding sites for cyclic AMP–responsive element binding
protein CREB/ATF1 transcription factors and using the
electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a CREB response
element, we detected a stronger binding in t-Darpp–expressing cells. The t-Darpp expression led to an increase in
expression and phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-1 transcription factors that were required for up-regulating Bcl2
levels. Indeed, knockdown of Akt, CREB, or ATF1 in t-Darpp–
expressing cells reduced Bcl2 protein levels. In conclusion, the
t-Darpp/Akt axis underscores a novel oncogenic potential of
t-Darpp in gastric carcinogenesis and resistance to druginduced apoptosis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):395–403]

Introduction
Gastric carcinoma is the second most common cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide, leading to more than 1 million deaths
per year (1–3). Although a decline in distal gastric cancer has been
observed over the past few decades in the Western world, a sharp
increase in the incidence of proximal gastroesophageal junctional
and esophageal adenocarcinomas was recently noted in the United
States, as well as many other Western populations (4–6).
Improvement in our currently limited diagnostic, preventive, and
therapeutic approaches to gastric cancer is a pressing need to

of expression with a tet-responsive plasmid expressing green fluorescent
protein (pTR/GFP; a kind gift from Dick D. Mosser, Department of
Molecular Biology and Genetics, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario,
Canada). Several clones were transfected with the GFP plasmid and
expression was evaluated after induction with the tetracycline derivative
doxycycline (1 Ag/mL; Sigma) for 24 h, and GFP fluorescence was monitored
using fluorescence microscopy. An optimal clone was selected to generate
a tet-inducible AGS stable cell line for t-Darpp. The tet-responsive
expression plasmid for t-Darpp was generated by PCR amplification of
the full-length coding sequence of t-Darpp and cloning into BamHI and
NheI sites of pTREpur2 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). The rtTAexpressing (Tet-On) cells were transfected with pTRE-t-Darpp plasmid and
selected in 0.8 Ag/mL of puromycin (Sigma) for 2 weeks. Puromycinresistant cell colonies were isolated with cloning rings, and stable clones
with optimal t-Darpp expression after induction with 1 Ag/mL of doxycycline (Sigma) were selected.
Mitochondrial apoptosis assay. Apoptosis was assessed using the
MitoCapture mitochondrial apoptosis detection kit (Biovision) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. This assay is based on the disruption of
the mitochondrial inner-membrane electrochemical potential using a fluorescent cationic dye. Briefly, AGS stables (3  105 cells per plate) expressing
t-Darpp or empty vector were seeded onto 60-mm culture plates. Apoptosis
was induced by treating cells with 20 Amol/L of acetyl ceramide or DMSO
(vehicle) for 2 h. Vehicle-treated and drug-treated cells were stained with
MitoCapture reagent and then analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. In
healthy cells, MitoCapture dye accumulated in the mitochondria as
aggregates (punctuate red fluorescence), and was detected in the FL2
channel. In apoptotic cells, the dye was dispersed throughout the cell as
monomers (diffused green fluorescence) and detected in the FL1 channel.
The percentage of apoptosis was determined in cells expressing t-Darpp
versus nonexpressing cells with and without drug treatment.
Detection of cytochrome c release. AGS cells stably expressing t-Darpp
or empty vector were cultured into eight-well slides (12  103 per well).
These cells were then treated with vehicle or 20 Amol/L ceramide for 3 h at
37jC. After cell fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, cytochrome c
was detected by immunofluorescence with mouse monoclonal anti–
cytochrome c antibody (1:200 dilution, PharMingen) followed by secondary
antimouse antibody conjugated to TRITC (1:400 dilution, Zymed Laboratories). In healthy cells, the mitochondrial cytochrome c staining (red
fluorescence) was punctate, whereas in apoptotic cells, it was bright and
diffused, indicating release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the
cytoplasm. The ratio of cells that presented diffuse cytochrome c staining
(indicating onset of apoptosis) to the total number of cells was averaged

14 normal gastric mucosa, 22 primary gastric cancer samples, and AGS cells
stably expressing empty vector or t-Darpp, using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen,
Gmbh). All human tissues were frozen samples and were dissected for
optimal tissue content to obtain z70% cellular purity. The tissue samples
were collected in accordance with institutional review board–approved
protocols. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized using the advantage
RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech). Quantitative PCR was then performed using
iCycler (Bio-Rad) with a threshold cycle number as determined using
iCycler software version 3.0. Reactions were done in triplicate and threshold
cycle numbers were averaged. We designed gene-specific primers for
t-Darpp ( forward 5¶-AGTGCGCTGGCTCAGTCTC-3¶, and reverse 5¶-CTCTTCGACTTGAGATGGTG-3¶) and Bcl2 ( forward 5¶-GAGGATTGTGGCCTTCTTTG-3¶, and reverse 5¶-GCCGGTTCAGGTACTCAGTC-3¶). Results were
normalized to HPRT1 ( forward 5¶-TTGGAAAGGGTGTTTATTCCTCA-3¶,
and reverse 5¶-TCCAGCAGGTCAGCAAAGAA-3¶), which had minimal
variation in cell lines, and all normal and neoplastic samples that we
tested and is, thus, considered to be a reliable and stable reference gene for
real-time RT-PCR (8, 35). All oligonucleotides were purchased from
Integrated DNA Technology. The fold overexpression was then calculated
according to the formula 2(Rt Et)/2(Rn En), as described previously (8). Rt is
the threshold cycle number for the reference gene observed in the tumor; Et
is the threshold cycle number for the experimental gene observed in the
tumor; Rn is the threshold cycle number for the reference gene observed in
the normal sample; and En is the threshold cycle number for the
experimental gene observed in the normal sample. Rn and En values were
taken from the 14 normal mucosa samples analyzed. Each tumor sample
was compared with the 14 normal samples and the relative fold expression
in tumors with SE, as shown in Fig. 1.
Cell culture and stable cell lines. AGS, MKN45, and SNU1 cell lines
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and used for this
study. These cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum
at 37jC in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Stably transfected AGS cells
expressing t-Darpp or pcDNA3 empty vector were generated as described
previously (15). After selection with 1 mg/mL of zeocin (Invitrogen Life
Technologies), the resulting resistant clones were screened for t-Darpp
protein expression by Western blot analysis. To generate the tetracyclineregulated expression system in AGS cells, we used pTet-On vector, which
expresses the reverse tet-responsive transcriptional activator rtTA (BD
Biosciences Clontech). First, the vector was linearized with ScaI restriction
enzyme and 20 Ag were used to transfect AGS cells. To establish stable
expression of rtTA, selection with 400 Ag/mL of G418 antibiotic (Mediatech)
was carried out for three weeks. After isolation of single resistant cell
colonies using cloning rings, they were screened for their optimal induction

had minimal variation in all normal and neoplastic gastric samples tested. X axis, samples; Y axis, fold overexpression.

anti-Akt, rabbit polyclonal anti–p-473 Akt, and rabbit polyclonal anti–p-Ser9
GSK3h antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Akt kinase assay. The nonradioactive Akt in vitro assay kit was
purchased from Stressgen Bioreagents. The Akt kinase activity assay is
based on ELISA that uses a specific synthetic peptide as a substrate for Akt
and a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the
substrate. The assay was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 15 Ag of total cell lysates were added to appropriate wells of
the Akt substrate microtiter plate and then incubated for 90 min at 30jC.
Following incubation with a phosphospecific substrate antibody for 60 min
at room temperature, wells were washed four times with 1 wash buffer.
The secondary anti-rabbit–horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added to
each well and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After four
washes with 1 wash buffer, TMB substrate was added to each well. To
allow for color formation, the microplate was incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. The color intensity was quantified by measuring absorbance
at 450 nm. As a control for the assay, 6 ng of purified active Akt were used.
The relative Akt kinase activity was calculated as follows: [average
absorbance (sample)
average absorbance (blank)]  dilution factor /
volume used in assay.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nuclear extracts from AGS cells
stably expressing empty vector or t-Darpp were prepared using NE-PER
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was done using a biotin-labeled
double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus CREB response
element (CRE; Panomics). DNA-protein binding reactions and DNA
detection were performed using LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit
(Pierce Biotechnology). Briefly, for each reaction, 5 Ag of nuclear protein
extracts were mixed with 1 binding buffer, 1 Ag/AL poly deoxyinosinicdeoxycytidylic acid, 50% glycerol, 1% NP40, 1 mol/L KCl, 100 mmol/L MgCl2,
200 mmol/L EDTA, and 10 fmol biotin-labeled CRE. For binding
competition reactions, 2 pmol of unlabeled CRE were added. For supershift
experiments, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with 4 Ag of anti–ATF1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation at room
temperature for 20 min, binding reactions were separated on 4% native
polyacrylamide gel then transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane
(Amersham Biosciences), and DNA was cross-linked for 15 min with the
membrane face down on a UV transilluminator equipped with 312-nm
bulbs. Biotin-labeled DNA was detected by chemiluminescence following
the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce Biotechnology).
Gene expression knockdown by small-interfering RNA. AGS cells
stably expressing empty vector or t-Darpp were transfected with Akt small
interfering RNA (siRNA; Cell Signaling Technology), control siRNA, t-Darpp
siRNA, ATF-1 siRNA, or CREB-1 siRNA oligonucleotides using siRNA
transfection reagent and transfection medium, following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For quantitative real-time RT-PCR
of Bcl2, mRNA was isolated from AGS cells expressing t-Darpp and
transfected with t-Darpp siRNA oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Figure 2. t-Darpp inhibits apoptosis induced by ceramide. AGS cells stably
expressing empty vector or t-Darpp were treated with 20 Amol/L ceramide or
DMSO for 2 h, and then stained with MitoCapture dye reagent (MitoCapture
Apoptosis Detection Kit from Biovision). Cells were analyzed for apoptosis
by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson). In healthy cells, the MitoCapture dye
formed red fluorescent aggregates that were detected in the FL2 channel. In
apoptotic cells, the dye was dispersed in the cell as green fluorescent monomers,
detected in the FL1 channel. The dot plot of the X axis (FL1), which is the
log of MitoCapture green fluorescent monomers, and the Y axis (FL2), which
depicts MitoCapture red fluorescent aggregates, was obtained by flow cytometry.
The apoptotic cells (typically FL1-positive and FL2-negative) are indicated in
the bottom right quadrant. A summary of the finding showing the percent of
apoptotic cells is shown in D and indicates that t-Darpp expression protected
against ceramide-induced apoptosis (P = 0.001).

from six different microscopic fields for more than 100 cells in each
category.
Luciferase assays. A pcDNA3-based mammalian expression plasmid
was generated for t-Darpp as described above. Luciferase activity using
the Bcl2 luciferase reporter construct (LB 124; ref. 36), which comprises
the full-length Bcl2 P1 promoter ( 3924 to 1286; a generous gift from
Linda M. Boxer, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA), was
measured in AGS cells. The cells were cultured into 24-well plates and
transiently cotransfected with (a) LB 124 and pcDNA3 vector; (b) LB 124
and t-Darpp; (c) LB 124, pcDNA3, and t-Darpp; or (d) LB 124, t-Darpp, and
dominant-negative AKT (Akt1 T308A and S473A, Addgene plasmid 9030) by
Fugene (Roche Diagnostics). The relative luciferase activity was determined
at 72 h posttransfection after normalization for Renilla activity according to
the supplier’s guidelines (Promega).
Western blot analysis. Cultured cells were harvested by scraping in
ice-cold PBS and spun down at 3,500 rpm in a bench top centrifuge for
10 min. Cell pellets were then lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer containing 1% of Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce Biotechnology). Protein concentration was determined by standard Bradford assay,
and total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gel loading was
normalized for equal h-actin (10 Ag protein per lane). Proteins were then
transferred onto Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and the membranes were probed with each antibody.
Mouse monoclonal anti–h-actin (C-2) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Darpp-32
(H-62, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) recognized t-Darpp at f28 kDa. Mouse
monoclonal ATF-1 (25C10G) and mouse monoclonal anti–caspase-9 P10
(F-7) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal
anti-Bcl2 (clone 7) was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories.

Results
Frequent overexpression of t-Darpp and Bcl2 mRNA in
gastric cancer. qRT-PCR showed overexpression of t-Darpp in 64%
of primary gastric cancer samples compared with 14 normal gastric
mucosa samples (P = 0.004). The expression of t-Darpp was almost
undetectable in normal tissue samples (Fig. 1). Similarly, Bcl2 was
overexpressed in 55% of tumors compared with normal samples
(P = 0.01). There was a trend, not reaching statistical significance,
between overexpression of t-Darpp and Bcl2 (P = 0.2), which is
attributed to the relatively small sample size and the complex
transcriptional regulation of Bcl2 in human tumors (Fig. 1).
Expression of t-Darpp protects mitochondrial transmembrane potential. To investigate the antiapoptotic activity of
t-Darpp, we used a drug-induced apoptosis model using acetyl
ceramide to promote the disruption of the mitochondrial

transmembrane potential, as an early apoptotic event in AGS cells.
In apoptotic cells, the mitochondrial membrane potential was
dissipated; thus, the MitoCapture dye was dispersed in the cell
as green fluorescent monomers detected in the FL1 channel. Cells
expressing t-Darpp were considerably more resistant to apoptosis
and showed a 7-fold reduction in apoptosis compared with control
cells following treatment with 20 Amol/L ceramide (P = 0.01).
Representative dot plots and the percentages of apoptotic cells
based on FL1-positive (green fluorescence) and FL2-negative

t-Darpp expression blocks the release of mitochondrial
cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9.
Western blot analysis on protein extracts indicated that treatment
of t-Darpp cells and control cells with 20 Amol/L ceramide for
24 h led to cleavage of procaspase-3, generating an active caspase-3
fragment (P17), and almost complete processing of procaspase-9
(Fig. 3A, lane 3), whereas t-Darpp–expressing cells showed no signs
of activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Fig. 3A, lane 6). A lower
dose of 10 Amol/L ceramide for 24 h was not sufficient to induce
apoptosis, confirming that 20 Amol/L was most appropriate for

Figure 3. t-Darpp blocks cytochrome c release and induces Akt kinase activity. AGS cells stably expressing t-Darpp or empty vector were treated with acetyl ceramide
or DMSO (vehicle). A, protein extracts from cells treated for 24 h were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti–caspase-3 antibody, which detects the pro-form
of caspase-3 protein (p35) and its active form (p17), and anti–caspase-9 antibody that recognizes only the pro-form of caspase-9. Activation of caspase-3 and
caspase-9, as shown by cleavage of procaspase-3 and almost complete processing of procaspase-9, was detected in control cells treated with 20 Amol/L ceramide
(lane 3). Under the same conditions, activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was blocked in t-Darpp–expressing cells (lane 6). Treatment with 10 Amol/L ceramide
was not sufficient to activate caspase-3 in all cells (lanes 2 and 5 ) and is shown to confirm that the use of 20 Amol/L was optimal for the cytochrome c release
experiment. The protein levels of both Bcl2 and t-Darpp were higher in ceramide or vehicle-treated AGS cells expressing t-Darpp (lanes 4–6) than control cells
(lanes 1–3 ). B, cells treated with 20 Amol/L ceramide for 3 h were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cytochrome c was detected by anti–cytochrome c antibody
and a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated to TRITC as depicted by red fluorescence. In healthy cells, cytochrome c staining was punctuated as shown for
vehicle-treated cells and ceramide-treated t-Darpp–expressing cells. In apoptotic cells, cytochrome c release was indicated by diffused staining, which was also found
for ceramide-treated control cells expressing empty vector. 4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue fluorescence ) was used as a nuclear counterstain. Cytochrome c
results for 10 Amol/L ceramide are not shown as no effect was observed. C, the ratio of cells that presented diffused cytochrome c staining (indicating onset of
apoptosis) to the total number of cells was averaged from six different microscopic fields for more than 100 cells in each category. Following treatment with 20 Amol/L
ceramide, only 14.8% of t-Darpp–expressing cells had diffused cytochrome c staining as opposed to 82.7% of control cells (P = 0.001). D, protein extracts (15 Ag)
from AGS cells expressing t-Darpp or empty vector, and purified active Akt (6 ng), as a control, were subjected to an in vitro Akt kinase activity assay analysis.
The relative Akt kinase activity in t-Darpp–expressing cells was more than 2-fold compared with control cells (P V 0.01).

t-Darpp Activates Akt Pathway and Up-regulates Bcl2

Figure 4. Phosphorylation of Akt is induced by t-Darpp. A, protein extracts from t-Darpp–expressing AGS cells or control cells were analyzed by immunoblotting
for p-Ser473 Akt, Akt, p-Ser9 GSK3h, Bcl2, and t-Darpp. Gel loading was normalized for equal h-actin. Phosphorylation of Akt was higher in t-Darpp–expressing cells than
empty vector control cells (Vect ). This directly correlated with GSK3h phosphorylation and with both Bcl2 and t-Darpp protein levels. B, protein extracts from AGS
cells expressing t-Darpp or empty vector and transfected with t-Darpp siRNA or control siRNA were subjected to Western blot analysis of p-Ser473 Akt, Akt, and t-Darpp.
Knockdown of t-Darpp in cells expressing t-Darpp (lane 4) decreased Akt phosphorylation to a comparable level as control cells (lane 3). C, tetracycline-inducible
AGS cells expressing t-Darpp were treated with doxycycline for 24 h to induce expression and cell lysates, at various time points after doxycycline removal, were
analyzed as indicated in the figure. Protein extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting for p-Ser473 Akt, Akt, Bcl2, and t-Darpp. Gel loading was normalized for equal
h-actin. As expected, t-Darpp protein level increased after 24 h induction of cells with doxycycline (lane 2) and remained high for 8 h after removal of doxycycline
(lanes 3–5 ) and substantially decreased after 24 h as shown in lanes 6 to 9. Akt phosphorylation and Bcl2 protein levels were induced after doxycycline treatment and
returned to base level at 96 h after its removal (lane 9). D, MKN45 and SNU1 gastric cancer cells were transfected with either control siRNA or t-Darpp siRNA to
knockdown endogenous t-Darpp. Cell lysates were collected at 48 h for Western blot analysis. As shown, knockdown of t-Darpp led to a reduction in t-Darpp protein
level with a notable decrease in pAKT and Bcl2 protein levels confirming the aforementioned results.

our assays. Based on these results, we used 20 Amol/L ceramide for immunofluorescence analysis of cytochrome c (Fig. 3B).
Immunofluorescence analysis, after treatment with 20 Amol/L
ceramide for 3 h, showed that cytochrome c was released from
mitochondria, indicating onset of apoptosis, as depicted by a
diffuse red fluorescence in control cells expressing empty vector
(82.7%; Fig. 3B and C). Conversely, the cytochrome c release was
considerably blocked in cells expressing t-Darpp (14.8%; Fig. 3B
and C). In healthy nonapoptotic cells, cytochrome c was blocked
as shown by mitochondrial punctuate staining (Fig. 3B). Taken
together, these results indicate that t-Darpp acts on the Bcl2 and
the intrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated by the mitochondrion.
Indeed, we noted that t-Darpp–expressing cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6)
consistently expressed Bcl2, whereas empty vector control cells
(Fig. 3A, lanes 1–2) had no obvious expression of Bcl2 at the same
exposure.
t-Darpp regulates Akt phosphorylation and kinase activity.
As Akt signaling pathway is one of the major cell survival pathways,
we investigated the effects of t-Darpp on Akt phosphorylation and
kinase activity. The in vitro Akt kinase assay results showed more
than a 2-fold increase of Akt activity in AGS cells expressing
t-Darpp compared with control cells (Fig. 3D). In addition, Western
blot analysis indicated that phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473
was higher in AGS cells expressing t-Darpp than control cells
(Fig. 4A). Similarly, phosphorylation of the Akt downstream target

www.aacrjournals.org

GSK3h was considerably higher in AGS cells expressing t-Darpp
than control cells (Fig. 4A). Taken together, these data indicate that
t-Darpp can regulate Akt phosphorylation and kinase activity in
cancer cells. Using t-Darpp siRNA to knock down t-Darpp in AGS
cells stably expressing t-Darpp led to a notable decrease in Akt
phosphorylation (Fig. 4B, lane 4) compared with control siRNA
(Fig. 4B, lane 2), confirming that increased level of p-Ser473 Akt was
dependent on t-Darpp. Furthermore, using a tetracycline-inducible
AGS stable cells expressing t-Darpp model, we showed t-Darpp
protein level predetermine the levels of phosphorylation of Akt
(Fig. 4C). Withdrawal of doxycycline to block t-Darpp expression
led to a time-dependent decrease in t-Darpp and phospho–Akt
protein levels as shown at time points (Fig. 4C, lanes 6–9). In
addition, there was a remarkable induction in Bcl2 level following
induction of t-Darpp and the Bcl2 protein levels returned to base
levels 96 h postwithdrawal of doxycycline, suggesting that Bcl2
expression was regulated by t-Darpp. The knockdown of endogenous t-Darpp in MKN45 and SNU1 cells led to a notable reduction
in pAkt and Bcl2 levels (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data show
that both exogenous and endogenous t-Darpp regulate the Bcl2
and pAkt protein levels.
t-Darpp expression leads to transcriptional up-regulation
of Bcl2. Our results, as described above, indicated that t-Darpp
mediated up-regulation of Bcl2 protein levels in AGS cells.
Consistent with these findings, overexpression of t-Darpp in AGS

this mechanism requires Akt. The results revealed an increase in
total and phosphoprotein levels of CREB and ATF-1 in t-Darpp–
expressing cells compared with empty vector control cells (Fig. 6B).
This finding further confirmed that Bcl2 up-regulation by t-Darpp
might be mediated through CREB/ATF-1 proteins. A further
validation was obtained by using ATF1 siRNA and CREB siRNA.
The results indicated that siRNA silencing of either ATF-1 (Fig. 6C,
lane 2) or CREB (Fig. 6C, lanes 3) expression led to down-regulation
of Bcl2. Control siRNA oligonucleotide did not alter expression,
thereby confirming siRNA specificity for both ATF-1 and CREB.
These results, together with the aforementioned findings, led to the
conclusion that t-Darpp–mediated Bcl2 regulation requires CREB/
ATF-1 factors. As the Bcl2 luciferase results suggested that Bcl2
expression was dependent on Akt in AGS cells (Fig. 5E), we
investigated whether knockdown of Akt could affect expression of
CREB/ATF-1 transcription factors and Bcl2. The results showed
that siRNA silencing of Akt in AGS cells expressing t-Darpp
resulted in a dramatic decrease of Bcl2 protein and total and
phosphoprotein levels of CREB/ATF-1 (Fig. 6D). Taken together,
our results confirm that t-Darpp mediates the increase in Akt
phosphorylation and kinase activity and this effect was required for
the CREB/ATF1 mediated up-regulation of Bcl2.

cells led to a considerable increase of Bcl2 protein level (Fig. 5A,
lane 2), whereas a knockdown of t-Darpp resulted in a notable
decrease of Bcl2 protein level (Fig. 5A, lane 3). To confirm that
t-Darpp transcriptionally up-regulated Bcl2 expression, we performed real-time RT-PCR and luciferase assays in AGS cells.
RT-PCR analysis indicated 5-fold increase of Bcl2 mRNA level in
AGS cells expressing t-Darpp compared with control cells (Fig. 5B).
Knockdown of t-Darpp expression with t-Darpp siRNA reduced
considerably Bcl2 mRNA level in t-Darpp–expressing cells (Fig. 5B),
indicating that Bcl2 expression was dependent on t-Darpp.
Moreover, the relative luciferase activity of Bcl2 promoter was
f2.5-fold higher in t-Darpp–expressing cells than in control cells
(Fig. 5C). Cotransfection with dominant-negative Akt and t-Darpp
plasmids resulted in a considerable reduction of luciferase activity
(Fig. 5C), indicating that Bcl2 expression was dependent on Akt.
t-Darpp increases CREB/ATF-1-CRE binding activity. The
Bcl2 promoter contains binding sites for several transcription
factors that include multiple binding sites for CREB. We investigated whether t-Darpp could modulate CREB/ATF-1 DNA-binding
activity. The EMSA assay showed a stronger CREB/ATF-1-CRE
binding in AGS cells expressing t-Darpp than in control cells
(Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 5). Supershift experiments using ATF-1
antibody, which also detects CREB, confirmed DNA-binding
specificity as indicated by an upper shift of CREB/ATF-1-CRE
complex signal (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 7). This complex signal was
negated by the addition of unlabeled CREB probe in excess (Fig. 6A,
lanes 3 and 6), thereby confirming specificity of the probe.
Up-regulation of Bcl2 by t-Darpp requires Akt and CREB/
ATF-1 factors. The results as shown in Fig. 6A suggested that
t-Darpp enhances binding of CREB/ATF1 to Bcl2 promoter. We
therefore investigated the effects of t-Darpp on CREB/ATF1 and if

Discussion
Using in vitro approaches, we showed that t-Darpp expression
provides potent antiapoptotic function to cancer cells through upregulation of Bcl2. One of our most important findings is the
realization of the ability of t-Darpp to activate the Akt pathway,
underscoring novel oncogenic functions of t-Darpp in cancer.
t-Darpp was cloned as a novel truncated isoform of Darpp-32 that

Figure 5. Up-regulation of Bcl2 expression by t-Darpp. A, AGS cells expressing t-Darpp or empty vector and transfected with t-Darpp siRNA or control siRNA
oligonucleotides were subjected to Western blot analysis of t-Darpp and Bcl2. Bcl2 protein expression level correlated with that of t-Darpp (lane 2), and silencing of
t-Darpp expression led to suppression of Bcl2 protein level (lane 3). Gel loading was normalized for equal h-actin (10 Ag proteins per lane on 12% SDS-PAGE).
B, mRNA was isolated from AGS cells stably expressing t-Darpp or empty vector, and cells were transfected with t-Darpp siRNA oligonucleotide. cDNA was then
synthesized and qRT-PCR was performed to determine mRNA expression level of Bcl2. mRNA level of Bcl2 was 5-fold higher in t-Darpp–expressing cells than in
control cells. Knockdown of t-Darpp decreased Bcl2 mRNA expression to a comparable level as pCDNA3 control cells. C, AGS cells were transfected with Bcl2
luciferase reporter (P1 promoter) and t-Darpp plasmid or pCDNA3 empty vector, and cotransfected with t-Darpp and Akt(DN) plasmids. Luciferase assay was done
on cell lysates 72 h posttransfection, and luciferase activity was determined after normalization for Renilla activity. The luciferase activity was f2.5-fold higher in
t-Darpp–expressing cells than in control cells. Knockdown of Akt kinase activity with the dominant negative Akt(DN) drastically decreased Bcl2 luciferase activity in
t-Darpp–transfected AGS cells.

t-Darpp Activates Akt Pathway and Up-regulates Bcl2

Figure 6. Involvement of CREB/ATF-1
factors and Akt in t-Darpp–mediated Bcl2
regulation. A, CREB/ATF-1 binding activity
is enhanced by t-Darpp. Nuclear extracts
(5 Ag) from AGS cells expressing t-Darpp
or empty vector were subjected to EMSA
using a biotin-labeled probe containing
a CRE (Panomics). DNA-protein binding
reactions and detection were performed
using LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA
kit (Pierce Biotechnology). CREB/ATF-1
DNA-binding activity was stronger in
t-Darpp–expressing cells (lane 5) than
in control cells (lane 2). Supershift
experiments were done using ATF-1
antibody, which detects both CREB and
ATF-1 proteins (lanes 4 and 7). B, protein
extracts from AGS cells stably expressing
t-Darpp or empty vector were analyzed by
Western blot of t-Darpp, phospho-CREB
(S133), phospho–ATF-1, CREB, ATF-1,
and Bcl2. Protein levels of CREB,
ATF-1, and Bcl2 were higher in t-Darpp–
expressing cells compared with control
cells. Similarly, phosphoproteins of both
CREB and ATF-1 were also higher in
t-Darpp–expressing cells than in control
cells. C, protein extracts from AGS cells
stably expressing t-Darpp and transfected
with ATF-1 siRNA, CREB siRNA, or control
siRNA oligonucleotides were subjected to
Western blot analysis of CREB, ATF-1, and
Bcl2. Anti-pCREB (serine 133) antibody,
which also detected pATF-1, and
anti–ATF-1 antibody, which detected both
ATF-1 and CREB proteins, were used.
Knockdown of ATF-1 (lane 2) and CREB
(lane 3) resulted in a decrease of Bcl2
protein levels. D, protein extracts from
AGS cells expressing t-Darpp and
transfected with Akt siRNA or control
siRNA were subjected to immunoblotting
of Akt, phospho-CREB(S133), phospho–
ATF-1, CREB, ATF-1, and Bcl2.
Knockdown of Akt led to a significant
decrease of phospho-CREB, CREB,
phospho-ATF-1, ATF-1, and Bcl2. Gel
loading was normalized for equal
h-actin (10 Ag protein per lane on 12%
SDS-PAGE).

Disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential is an early
apoptotic event that can be induced by drugs or stress. In this
report, we have used ceramide as a model for induction of stress
and apoptosis in cancer cells. Ceramide is known to induce
apoptosis through generation of reactive-oxygen species and by
affecting the mitochondrial membrane potential (reviewed by
Mathias et al. in ref. 39). Ceramide analogues were reported to
induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria (40), which is
a critical step in the apoptotic pathway that involves activation
of caspase-9. The expression of t-Darpp in AGS cells blocked
the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 following ceramide

maps to 17q12, a region that is frequently amplified in gastric
cancer. Although Darpp-32 is known as a major regulator of
dopamine signaling in the brain (37, 38), there is no information
about t-Darpp. We have found that t-Darpp is overexpressed in
more than two thirds of gastric cancers compared with normal
gastric mucosae (P = 0.004). The fact that t-Darpp was identified as
the critical target in the most commonly amplified region in gastric
cancer (7, 8) has prompted us to investigate the potential
oncogenicity of this protein. Our earlier results showed that
t-Darpp expression provides antiapoptotic properties to gastric
cancer cells without inhibiting the p53 transcription activity (15).

expressing t-Darpp, we showed a strong induction of phosphorylation and activation of Akt as shown by Western blot analyses
of p-Ser473 Akt and p-Ser9 GSK3h, a known downstream target of
Akt. We further validated this finding by knocking down exogenous t-Darpp stable expression (AGS) or endogenous expression (MKN45 and SNU1) that resulted in a dramatic loss of Akt
phosphorylation without affecting the level of total Akt protein.
It is conceivable that t-Darpp mediates Akt activity and phosphorylation through regulating the upstream PI3K pathway.
Signaling through PI3K begins with signals relayed to the internal
cellular environment by transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases
(46). In addition, activation of PI3K through inactivation of the
phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) tumor-suppressor
gene is a common mechanism in diverse cancer types (25). The
knockdown of Akt in t-Darpp stably expressing cells led to a
reduction in CREB/ATF1 and Bcl2 protein levels, compared with
empty vector control, suggesting that the t-Darpp regulation of
Bcl2 was mediated by CREB/ATF1 and dependent on Akt activity.
Although the overall consensus is that CREB expression is
constitutive and not subject to regulation, there are reports that
indicate that CREB can be regulated by agents that activate the
cAMP pathway (47). Akt potently induces serine 133 phosphorylation of CREB and promotes recruitment of CBP (48). Our
results strongly indicate that the t-Darpp/Akt axis regulates the
CREB/ATF-1 factors.
In summary, we showed frequent overexpression of t-Darpp in
gastric cancer. The up-regulation of t-Darpp provided cancer cells
with a drug-resistant phenotype and enhanced survival properties.
The t-Darpp/Akt axis signaling underscores a novel oncogenic role
for t-Darpp in cancer cell survival.

treatment. Moreover, our results using the MitoCapture and
cytochrome c release assays, as measures of the integrity of the
mitochondria, have shown that t-Darpp expression can enforce the
mitochondrial transmembrane potential and protect against
apoptosis following ceramide-induced stress.
Bcl2 is known to inhibit cytochrome c release from mitochondria, thus blocking caspase activation and the apoptotic process
(33). Interestingly, the expression of t-Darpp led to up-regulation of
Bcl2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in AGS cells. This
mRNA and protein levels of Bcl2 were reduced upon knockdown of
t-Darpp in AGS cells stably expressing t-Darpp. The luciferase assay
using the full P1 Bcl2 promoter and qRT-PCR data indicated that
t-Darpp regulates Bcl2 at the transcriptional level. The Bcl2
promoter consists of P1 ( 3924 to 1286) and P2 ( 1278 to 8)
regulatory regions. The P1 promoter contains CRE, where both
CREB and ATF family members bind and lead to transcriptional
up-regulation of Bcl2 (36, 41, 42). In line with this finding, we
showed that t-Darpp expression can increase Bcl2 promoter
activity as indicated by enhanced CREB/ATF-1 binding to a
CREB-specific probe on EMSA. The t-Darpp expression mediated
up-regulation and phosphorylation of both CREB and ATF-1,
whereas their silencing resulted in suppression of Bcl2. These
findings indicate that t-Darpp regulates Bcl2 expression through a
molecular mechanism that requires CREB and ATF-1 factors. The
Bcl2 promoter contains binding sites for multiple transcription
factors, and therefore the contribution of t-Darpp/Creb/Atf1 axis to
this mechanism is possibly dependent on the molecular signature
of cancer cells.
The Akt/protein kinase B pathway is a major regulator of cell
survival and blocks apoptosis by growth factors against multiple
apoptotic stimuli in many different cell types (43, 44). Several
reports have emerged, indicating that Akt pathway activation is
implicated in conferring resistance to conventional chemotherapy
and multiple chemotherapeutic agents (5-fluorouracil, Adriamycin, mitomycin C, and cisplatinum) on cancer cells (18). Phosphorylated Akt (active form) expression may help to predict the
clinical outcome of gastric cancer patients (45). Our data indicate
that t-Darpp expression increases the kinase activity of Akt. In
addition, using two independent cell models, AGS cells stably
expressing t-Darpp and tetracycline-inducible AGS stable cells
