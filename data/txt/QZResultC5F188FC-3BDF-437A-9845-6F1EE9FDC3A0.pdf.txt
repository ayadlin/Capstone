Abstract
Metastasis by cancer cells relies upon the acquisition of the ability to evade anoikis, a cell death process
elicited by detachment from extracellular matrix (ECM). The molecular mechanisms that ECM-detached
cancer cells use to survive are not understood. Striking increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) occur in
ECM-detached mammary epithelial cells, threatening cell viability by inhibiting ATP production, suggesting
that ROS must be neutralized if cells are to survive ECM-detachment. Here, we report the discovery of a
prominent role for antioxidant enzymes, including catalase and superoxide dismutase, in facilitating the
survival of breast cancer cells after ECM-detachment. Enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes in
nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells detached from ECM resulted in ATP elevation and survival in the
luminal space of mammary acini. Conversely, silencing antioxidant enzyme expression in multiple breast
cancer cell lines caused ATP reduction and compromised anchorage-independent growth. Notably,
antioxidant enzyme-deﬁcient cancer cells were compromised in their ability to form tumors in mice. In
aggregate, our results reveal a vital role for antioxidant enzyme activity in maintaining metabolic activity
and anchorage-independent growth in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, these ﬁndings imply that
eliminating antioxidant enzyme activity may be an effective strategy to enhance susceptibility to cell
death in cancer cells that may otherwise survive ECM-detachment. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3704–15. 2013

Introduction
Mammary epithelial cells require attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for survival, and ECM-detachment
results in the induction of a caspase-mediated cell death
program known as anoikis (1–3). As such, tumor cells
require resistance to anoikis to survive during cancer progression (4, 5). The ability to evade anoikis is critically
important during the metastatic cascade, as cancer cells
are forced to survive in the absence of ECM-attachment
while in the blood or lymphatic vessels. Therefore, a better
understanding of how cancer cells survive in the absence of
ECM-attachment could ultimately lead to the development
of novel therapeutic approaches to inhibit tumor progression and metastasis.
Interestingly, previous research has revealed that inhibition
of anoikis is not sufﬁcient to promote the long-term survival of

ECM-detached cells (6). Multiple anoikis-independent pathways have been discovered to contribute to cell death following
ECM-detachment (7–9). We have previously shown that an
energy deﬁciency (diminished ATP levels) caused by ECMdetachment can compromise the viability of these cells independent of the induction of anoikis (10). We discovered that
oncogenic signaling can rectify metabolic defects in ECMdetached cells by enhancing glucose uptake, promoting ﬂux
through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), stimulating
NADPH generation, and the subsequent elimination of ECM
detachment-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, we found that the neutralization of ROS is sufﬁcient to
elevate ATP levels and to promote the survival of ECMdetached cells independently of any changes in glucose uptake
(10). Together, these data unmask detachment-induced ROS as
a critical barrier to the long-term survival of ECM-detached
cells and presumably to the successful metastasis of tumor
cells (11).
The discovery of this novel obstruction to the viability of
ECM-detached cells suggests that metastatic cancer cells have
developed mechanisms to eliminate detachment-induced
ROS. Typically, eukaryotic cells depend on multiple antioxidant enzymes to remove excess quantities of ROS. Catalase is a
ubiquitous oxidoreductase that neutralizes hydrogen peroxide
by converting it into water and molecular oxygen (12). Likewise, superoxide dismutases, a family of 3 antioxidant enzymes
(SOD1, SOD2, and SOD3), are responsible for the elimination of
superoxide (13). These enzymes vary in their localization as

Antioxidant Enzymes Mediate Breast Cancer Cell Survival

CuZn-SOD (SOD1) is expressed in the cytoplasm, nuclear
compartments, and lysosomes of cells, whereas Mn-SOD
(SOD2) speciﬁcally localizes to the mitochondria.
Given the important role of these enzymes in modulating
ROS, it is possible that during periods of ECM-detachment, the
activity of antioxidant enzymes is necessary to maintain robust
ATP production and promote survival. Multiple lines of evidence suggest a role for the activity of antioxidant enzymes in
tumor progression. Immunohistochemical analyses of antioxidant enzyme expression in breast cancer tissue have revealed
that catalase, SOD1, and SOD2 have ampliﬁed expression in
tumor tissue when compared with adjacent benign tissue (14).
More recently, SOD1 was discovered to be the molecular target
of a potent compound that inhibits the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (15), suggesting that the pharmacologic
inhibition of antioxidant enzymes could be an effective strategy to impede tumor progression.
In this study, we assess the role of antioxidant enzymes in
mediating the survival of ECM-detached cells and the importance of antioxidant enzymes to the anchorage-independent
growth of cancer cells. We show that the expression of antioxidant enzymes in mammary epithelial cells enhances ATP
generation in ECM-detached cells and promotes their survival
in the luminal space of mammary acini. Furthermore, we have
discovered that the elimination of antioxidant enzyme expression in breast cancer cells limits ATP production in suspension, prohibits vigorous anchorage-independent growth, and
reduces lung tumor burden in mouse xenograft assays. In
aggregate, these data reveal that antioxidant enzymes are
critical for the anchorage-independent survival of breast cancer cells and suggest that antioxidant enzymes may be a viable
target for the development of novel chemotherapeutics aimed
at eradicating ECM-detached cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MCF-10A cells were cultured as described previously (10).
T47D cells [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] were
cultured in RPMI-1640 media (GIBCO) plus 10% FBS (GIBCO).
SKBR3 cells (ATCC) were cultured in McCoy's media (GIBCO)
plus 10% FBS. MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC) were cultured in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (GIBCO) plus 10% FBS.
Penicillin/streptomycin, and plasmocin were added to all
cultures.
ATP assays
For the measure of ATP in detached cells, the ATP Determination Kit (Invitrogen) was used as described previously
(10). The data from these assays show representative experiments from at least 3 independent replicates.
Caspase assays
Caspase activation was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7
Assay Kit (Promega). Cells were plated at a density of 13,333
cells per well in 96-well poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)
(poly-HEMA) coated plates. Caspase activation was measured
according to manufacturer's instructions.

Proliferation and cell death assays
For measuring cell proliferation, 75,000 cells in 1 mL of
media were plated per well of a 6-well plate. At 24, 48, and 72
hours, cells were stained with Trypan blue (Invitrogen) and
counted using a hemocytometer.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in 1% NP40 on ice for 20 minutes. Lysates
were spun at 14,000  g at 4 C for 30 minutes and normalized
using a BCA Assay (Pierce Biotechnology). Lysates were then
subjected to SDS-PAGE and transfer/blotting was conducted
as previously described (16).
Glucose uptake assays
Glucose uptake was measured using the Amplex Red Glucose Assay Kit (Invitrogen) as described previously (10). The
data shown in the ﬁgures show representative experiments
from at least 3 independent replicates.
ROS assays
Cells were plated at a density of 13,333 cells per well in 96well poly-HEMA–coated plates. After 24 hours, carboxy- H2
DCFDA (Invitrogen) or CellROX Green Reagent (Invitrogen)
was added to each well at a concentration of 10 mmol/L and
mixed vigorously. Fluorescence of both Carboxy- H2DCFDA
and CellROX was measured using a plate reader. In some cases,
Amplex Red (Invitrogen) was used to measure ROS according
to manufacturer's speciﬁcations.
Soft agar assays
Cells were plated in soft agar experiments as described
previously (10). In antioxidant compound experiments, the
indicated concentration was added at the time of plating and at
feedings throughout the duration of the experiment. Colony
number was determined as described previously (10). The
ﬁgures including data from these assays show representative
experiments from at least 3 independent replicates.
Retroviral transduction
The pLNCX-Neo–based retroviral vectors encoding wildtype catalase, and catalase with the signal sequence SKL were
used to generate stable cell lines as described previously (10).
3D cell culture
To generate acini, cells were grown as described previously
(17). Immunoﬂuorescence of acini was conducted as described
previously (17). For examination of luminal ﬁlling, acini were
imaged using confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R) to visualize the
center of each structure, and then were scored as described
previously (10). The ﬁgures including data from these assays
show representative experiments from at least 3 independent
replicates.
AlamarBlue assay
Cells were plated at a density of 13,333 cells per well in 96-well
poly-HEMA–coated plates. Ten microliters of AlamarBlue reagent (Invitrogen) was added to each well and incubated at 37 C
for 1 to 4 hours and ﬂuorescence was measured on a plate reader.

Fatty acid oxidation assay
Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) was measured in the indicated
cells as described previously (10). The ﬁgure from these
assays shows pooled and normalized data from multiple
experiments.
Short hairpin RNA
Mission (Sigma-Aldrich) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were used and the PLKO.4 shRNA viruses were produced and used to generate stable knockdowns as described
previously (10).
Mice
Female athymic mice (Foxn1-nu), 5- to 6-week-old were
obtained from Harlan Laboratories. We injected 2  106 MDAMB-231 cells into the lateral tail vein of 7-week-old female nude
mice. Six weeks after injection, the mice were sacriﬁced and
lungs were removed. Lungs were ﬁxed in Bouin's solution for 24
hours and stored in 70% ethanol before analysis. Procedures
were evaluated and approved by the University of Notre Dame
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol number 13-019).
Computed tomography imaging and analysis
Computed tomography (CT) images were acquired with a
trimodal Albira PET/SPECT/CT imaging system (Carestream
Molecular Imaging). Mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoﬂurane in an induction box. Mice were placed inside scanner
and secured in a tooth bar. A CT scan (110 mm FOV, 45 kVp, 200
mA, at 400 projections) was then conducted. The CT scans were
reconstructed using the FBP algorithm.
To conduct normal lung density analysis, CT images were ﬁrst
segmented using the PMOD "tools">"external">"segmentation"
operation. Segmentation was set to the range 550 to 200 (HU)
and the "create a VOI Template/Mask" check box was created to
obtain the normal lung density volume. VolView 3.2 (Kitware)
was used for image rendering and visualization of CT images.
ImageJ v1.44 was used to generate image montages.
Hemotoxylin and eosin staining
Lung tissues were ﬁxed with Bouin's ﬁxative for more than
24 hours. After dehydrating and embedding in parafﬁn wax, the
tissues were cut into 4 mm slices. The slices were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. The pathogenesis of lung injury was
observed under microscope.

Results
Multiple antioxidant compounds enhance ATP
production in ECM-detached cells and promote
anchorage-independent growth
Given that our previous research has revealed that treatment of ECM-detached cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or
Trolox could enhance ATP production and facilitate anchorage
independence (10), we investigated the ability of additional
antioxidant compounds to promote viability in ECM-detached
cells. Using MCF-10A cells, a nonmalignant mammary epithelial cell line, we examined ATP levels in cells cultured on
nonadherent plates and treated with the antioxidants Trolox,

3706

epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), or vitamin C (ascorbic acid).
In each case, we were able to effectively diminish ROS levels
and detect a statistically signiﬁcant increase in ATP levels
(Fig. 1A). In addition, as noted previously with NAC and Trolox
treatment (10), we detected no signiﬁcant alterations in glucose uptake between untreated and antioxidant treated
detached cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). We then sought to
understand whether these antioxidant compounds can augment anchorage-independent growth in soft agar assays. To do
this, we used MCF-10A cells engineered to express HPV-E7 (to
promote proliferation) and Bcl-2 (to block apoptosis) as
parental MCF-10A cells lack the capacity to grow in soft agar
(10). Treatment of these cultures with Trolox, EGCG, or
vitamin C induced a substantial increase in colony number
(Fig. 1B and C). In addition, these treatments did not result
in any signiﬁcant alterations to proliferation (Fig. 1D) or cell
death (Supplementary Fig. 2) in attached cells, suggesting
that the effects of these antioxidants in the soft agar assays
are speciﬁc to modulation of ATP levels. In addition, we
found mixed results with regards to the reversibility of this
effect (Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting that other factors
(i.e., compound stability) likely contribute to the stability of
this effect. These data reveal that the ability of antioxidant
compounds to increase ATP generation and promote
anchorage-independent growth is not limited to NAC or
Trolox treatment and suggest that multiple ROS-neutralizing mechanisms may be effective in facilitating the survival
of ECM-detached cells.
Overexpression of catalase in mammary epithelial cells
promotes ATP generation in ECM-detached cells and
promotes luminal ﬁlling in mammary acini
Given that antioxidant compounds can rescue the ATP
deﬁciency in ECM-detached cells, we investigated whether
increased expression of antioxidant enzymes could similarly
affect ATP generation in detached mammary epithelial cells.
We engineered cell lines with elevated expression of catalase,
an antioxidant enzyme that has been shown to be involved in
cell survival in breast cancer cells (18, 19). Given that the
distinct localization of catalase to the peroxisome has
previously been revealed to enhance its antioxidant activity
(20), we expressed diffusely localized (KANL) or peroxisomally targeted (SKL) catalase in MCF-10A cells (Fig. 2A). To
investigate whether catalase expression rescues ATP production in ECM-detached cells, we examined cellular ATP
levels in 10A-KANL and 10A-SKL cells cultured on nonadherent plates. We detected a substantial increase in ATP
levels and achieved a comparable reduction in ROS levels in
both 10A-KANL and 10A-SKL cells compared with the 10A
control (Fig. 2B and C). These data suggest that catalase
does not require speciﬁc peroxisomal targeting to promote
ATP generation in ECM-detached cells. In addition, the
increased ATP levels in detached cells expressing catalase
was not due to alterations in glucose uptake in these
cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). Previously published data has
suggested that the neutralization of ROS in ECM-detached
cells enhances ATP levels by promoting FAO (10). When
examining FAO efﬁcacy in cells with increased catalase

expression, we discovered that FAO was signiﬁcantly augmented (Fig. 2D). Although these data suggest that catalase
expression itself may be induced during ECM-detachment or
in transformed cells to facilitate cell survival, we did not
detect any alterations in catalase expression during ECMdetachment nor when we compared untransformed MCF10A cells with breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. 5).
These data suggest that catalase activity becomes critical to
ATP production and survival during ECM-detachment when
glucose uptake is diminished (10).
We then asked whether the expression of catalase could
promote luminal ﬁlling in a three-dimensional (3D) model
of mammary acini development (21), a more physiologically
relevant model as the centrally located cells die due to lack
of ECM-attachment (6, 10, 22–25). The acini generated from

www.aacrjournals.org

10A-KANL and 10A-SKL cells exhibited a dramatic increase
in the number of structures scoring as either "mostly ﬁlled"
or "ﬁlled" when compared with control 10A acini (Fig. 2E).
Remarkably, the expression of catalase (either KANL or
SKL) did not appreciably alter the induction of anoikis
(Fig. 2F), suggesting that catalase-mediated induction of
luminal ﬁlling is not due to anoikis evasion. Interestingly,
when examining how catalase expression affects cell viability at earlier time points after ECM-detachment (i.e.,
3 hours), we found that catalase expression enhances ATP
levels and cell viability (as measured by AlamarBlue reduction) without affecting anoikis (Supplementary Fig. 6).
These data lend further credence to the supposition that
catalase expression can promote cell viability by stimulating ATP production.

age-independent growth in breast cancer cells, we treated
T47D cells with dorsomorphin dihydrochloride and measured
anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar assay. Indeed,
AMPK inhibition was sufﬁcient to substantially hinder colony
formation in soft agar (Fig. 3C and D). Collectively, these data
suggest that catalase expression promotes ATP production
and anchorage-independent growth by stimulating the AMPK
pathway.

To further rule out any connection between catalase and
apoptosis, we expressed catalase in 10A cells overexpressing
the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (6). Bcl-2–positive acinar structures derived from cells expressing catalase show a similar
ability to promote luminal ﬁlling as we observe many more
"ﬁlled" or "mostly ﬁlled" structures and a signiﬁcant loss of
"clear" structures (Fig. 2G). These data further show that
catalase promotes luminal ﬁlling by enhancing ATP generation
independently of any effects on anoikis.

Catalase is critical for the preservation of ATP
production and anchorage-independent growth in ECMdetached invasive breast cancer cells
Given that catalase was sufﬁcient to promote cell viability in
nonmalignant ECM-detached mammary epithelial cells, we
wondered whether catalase expression was necessary for the
survival of invasive breast cancer cells in the absence of ECMattachment. To address this matter, we used lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNA to generate an MDA-MB-231 (231) cell
line that is deﬁcient in catalase expression (Fig. 4A). Using
these cells, we discovered that catalase-deﬁcient 231 cells have
a substantial decrease in the production of ATP and increased
levels of ROS when detached from the ECM (Fig. 4B and C). This
ATP deﬁcit can be rescued through treatment with Trolox (Fig.
4B) or through the reexpression of catalase (Supplementary
Fig. 7). In addition, these alterations in ATP levels are not a
result of modulations in glucose uptake as no signiﬁcant
changes in glucose uptake are observed when catalase is
eliminated (Supplementary Fig. 8). Furthermore, catalase
knockdown in 231 cells substantially abrogated anchorageindependent growth (Fig. 4D and E). Anchorage-independent
growth could be rescued in catalase-deﬁcient 231 cells through

Neutralization of ROS by catalase promotes ATP
production by modulating AMPK activation
Next we further investigated the molecular mechanism
underlying the ability of catalase to improve ATP production
in ECM-detached cells. As shown in Fig. 2D, catalase expression
promotes FAO in ECM-detached 10A cells. A critical regulator
of FAO efﬁcacy is the AMPK pathway. AMPK activation results
in the phosphorylation and inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), an enzyme that is known to inhibit FAO by
producing malonyl-CoA. Given this, we investigated whether
catalase expression could alter AMPK activation in ECMdetached cells. Interestingly, we found that total AMPK levels
and AMPK activation (as measured by phosphorylation of
ACC) were increased in catalase-expressing cells (Fig. 3A).
When we inhibited the activation of AMPK in catalase-expressing 10A cells using the inhibitor dorsomorphin dihydrochloride, we found that the catalase-mediated increase in ATP levels
was completely abrogated (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that
catalase expression enhances AMPK signaling in ECMdetached cells in a fashion that promotes ATP production.

Antioxidant Enzymes Mediate Breast Cancer Cell Survival

Trolox treatment or catalase reexpression (Fig. 4D and E),
conﬁrming that the loss of anchorage-independent growth in
231 cells following catalase elimination is due to alterations
in oxidative stress. While a number of factors (e.g. proliferation, apoptosis) can alter anchorage-independent growth in
soft agar assays, catalase-deﬁcient 231 cells display no
marked changes in proliferative capacity (Supplementary
Fig. 9) or cell death (Supplementary Fig. 10) compared with
control 231 cells. Thus, these data suggest that anchorageindependent growth is inhibited in catalase-deﬁcient invasive breast cancer cells due to ROS-mediated alterations in
metabolism.
To investigate whether these data are reproducible in
other breast cancer cell lines, we generated catalase-deﬁcient T47D cells (Fig. 4F). Like 231 cells, catalase-deﬁcient
T47D cells displayed a signiﬁcant loss in ATP levels when
detached from the ECM that could subsequently be rescued
by Trolox treatment (Fig. 4G). These alterations in ATP
levels were independent of any changes in glucose uptake
(Supplementary Fig. 11). When we examined the ability of
these cells to grow in an anchorage-independent fashion, we
found that the elimination of catalase dramatically reduced
colony formation in a soft agar assay (Fig. 4H and I). The loss
of growth in soft agar assays induced by catalase loss could
be efﬁciently rescued through Trolox treatment (Fig. 4H and
I). These changes in anchorage-independent growth were
not a result of enhanced proliferative capacity (Supplementary Fig. 12) or diminished viability (Supplementary Fig. 13)
in attached cells. These data collectively suggest that breast
cancer cells rely on catalase to reduce oxidative stress when
detached from the ECM.
The elimination of other enzymes involved in reducing
oxidative stress in breast cancer cells results in
compromised ATP production and diminished
anchorage-independent growth
Given the data above, we postulated that other antioxidant enzymes may provide similar support to ECM-detached
cells. To investigate this hypothesis, we engineered T47D
cells that are stably deﬁcient in SOD2 (Fig. 5A). Indeed, the
loss of SOD2 in ECM-detached T47D cells resulted in a
signiﬁcant reduction of ATP levels (Fig. 5B) that is independent of any alterations in glucose uptake (Supplementary
Fig. 14). Furthermore, the reduction of SOD2 expression in
T47D cells caused a substantial inhibition of anchorageindependent growth (Fig. 5C and D). Despite these substantial changes, we were unable to detect any alterations in
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 15) or cell viability (in
attached cells; Supplementary Fig. 16) when SOD2 expression was reduced. In addition, shRNA-mediated reduction of
SOD1 or Nrf2 (a transcription factor that promotes antiox-

idant enzyme expression) in T47D cells resulted in a similar
loss of ATP levels (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18) and a
comparable reduction in anchorage-independent growth
(Fig. 5E and F). As described above, ErbB2 expression has
previously been shown to promote ATP generation in ECMdetached cells through a mechanism involving the promotion of PPP ﬂux and the reduction of ROS (10). However,
even in breast cancer cells that overexpress ErbB2 (i.e.,
SKBR3 cells), the elimination of antioxidant enzymes like
SOD2 is sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly diminish ATP levels in
ECM-detached cells (Supplementary Fig. 19). Collectively,
these data reveal that breast cancer cells can rely on the
activity of the antioxidant enzyme program to promote
anchorage-independent growth.
The activity of antioxidant enzymes is critical for tumor
formation in vivo
We were interested in determining whether the reduction of
antioxidant enzyme activity would also affect tumor formation
in vivo. To address this question, we injected parental or
catalase-deﬁcient 231 cells into the tail vein of female nude
mice and monitored tumor formation in the lungs over time
(26). Intravenous injection was selected to force the 231 cells to
grow in suspension as soon as they were injected into the
animal. Following the injection of cells, we monitored the lungs
of the mice every 2 weeks by X-ray CT scan) (27). Over time, the
lungs of the mice injected with parental 231 cells display
dramatically less healthy lung volume (as measured by CT
imaging) than do those of mice injected with catalase-deﬁcient
231 cells (Fig. 6A and B). When animals were sacriﬁced 6 weeks
following tail vein injection and their lungs were isolated, those
injected with wild-type 231 cells had amassed substantial
tumor burden on the lungs (Fig. 6C). However, the lung tumor
burden in mice injected with catalase-deﬁcient 231 cells was
signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 6C). Hematoxylin and eosin staining
of the resulting tumors did not show any discernible differences in histology when comparing tumors from wild-type 231
cells to tumors from catalase-deﬁcient 231 cells (Fig. 6C). We
quantitated this effect by determining the percent of the lung
tissue that contained tumor growth and found a statistically
signiﬁcant reduction in lung tumor burden in mice injected
with catalase-deﬁcient 231 cells (Fig. 6D). These data suggest
that antioxidant enzymes are critical for the colonization of
lung tissue by cancer cells through the promotion of ECMdetached cancer cell survival.

Discussion
The evasion of cell death by cancer cells, particularly during
the metastatic cascade, has long been recognized as a hallmark
of cancer (28). However, the precise mechanisms used by

cancer cells to evade cell death caused by ECM-detachment
have yet to be fully delineated. Here, using both in vitro and
in vivo approaches, we describe a novel role for antioxidant
enzymes in promoting the survival of ECM-detached breast
cancer cells (see Fig. 7). The elimination of antioxidant
enzymes has no discernible effect on the proliferation or
survival of ECM-attached cancer cells, suggesting that the
ability of antioxidant enzymes to facilitate cell survival is
limited to ECM-detachment. Furthermore, these ﬁndings
reveal a critical role for antioxidant enzymes in maintaining
energy generation in ECM-detached cells and suggest that the

cancer cells may be an effective chemotherapeutic approach to
halt metastatic spread.
Previously, we had shown that the treatment of MCF-10A
cells with antioxidant compounds could rescue ECMdetachment induced ATP loss (10). The data reported here
extend on these observations and reveal that enhanced
expression of antioxidant enzymes can also elevate ATP
levels in ECM-detached cells. The regulation of ATP generation by ROS seems to be due to the stimulation of AMPK
activation when ROS levels are reduced. The precise mechanism by which AMPK levels are regulated by ROS remains
poorly understood and will be the focus of future studies. In

addition, it is interesting to note that reduction in oxidative
stress by multiple distinct mechanisms can similarly impact
ATP generation in ECM-detached cells. For example,
enzymes that neutralize peroxide (catalase), enzymes that
eliminate superoxide (SOD2), and vitamin E analogs (Trolox)
all have a strikingly similar capacity to elevate ATP levels in
ECM-detached cells.
This study follows on the heels of other reports that emphasize the importance of neutralizing oxidative stress during
tumor progression (29). Recently, it has become evident that
the expression of a number of oncogenes (i.e., Ras, Raf, Myc)
results in a reduction of oxidative stress that is dependent on
the induction of Nrf2 (30). These data are consistent with the
results reported here in that Nrf2, catalase, and SOD2 all have a
similar capacity to promote ATP generation in ECM-detached
cells. In addition, this report shows that Nrf2 is required for KRas (G12D)-mediated pancreatic tumor formation (30). Given
our data, the loss of Nrf2 could result in a concomitant decrease

in the expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes thus
rendering cancerous cells susceptible to cell death caused by
ECM-detachment. Furthermore, recent work has revealed a
critical role for pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and CD44 in
enhancing ﬂux through the PPP, generating NADPH, and thus
facilitating the survival of cancer cells during oxidative stress
(31–33). In light of our data discussed here, it seems possible
that cells expressing PKM2 and CD44 could be better equipped
to handle deﬁciencies in antioxidant enzyme production to
survive during ECM-detachment.
Another signiﬁcant implication of the data presented
here is the possibility that a reduction of antioxidant
enzyme activity could be an attractive chemotherapeutic
strategy for the speciﬁc elimination of ECM-detached cancer cells. Such a strategy could be particularly potent given
that it has the potential to substantially inhibit the successful metastasis of cancer cells. Of course, additional
studies must pursue the efﬁcacy of inhibiting antioxidant
