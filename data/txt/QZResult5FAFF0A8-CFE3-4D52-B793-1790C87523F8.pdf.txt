suggested a moderate level of clinical and palliative activity when it was used as a single agent. However, when carboplatin was combined with a taxane and estramustine,
high response rates were observed in several recent clinical trials. In addition, a randomized trial suggested that satraplatin plus prednisone improved progression-free survival compared with prednisone alone. For patients who progressed after docetaxel,
no standard options existed in the literature that was reviewed. Several preliminary
reports suggested that carboplatin and oxaliplatin may have activity as second-line
chemotherapy. Platinum chemotherapy drugs historically have been considered inactive in HRPC, although a review of the data suggested otherwise. Carboplatin, in particular, induced very high response rates when it was combined with estramustine and
a taxane, but it also appeared to have activity in patients who progressed after docetaxel. Satraplatin plus prednisone is being investigated in a large Phase III trial as second-line chemotherapy for HRPC. Targeting neuroendocrine cells may provide a new
therapeutic approach to HRPC. Cancer 2007;109:477–86.  2006 American Cancer

n 2005, prostate cancer was the second leading cause of cancer
death in men in the United States.1 When it is confined locally, prostate cancer is curable. However, disease that has advanced beyond the
prostate is not considered curable.2 Although androgen-deprivation
therapy (ADT) may control advanced prostate cancer for many years,
patients eventually develop hormone-refractory prostate cancer
(HRPC) as a precursor to disease progression and cancer-related
death.3
Over a decade ago, prostate cancer was considered relatively resistant to chemotherapy using traditional measures of radiographic
response. In systematic reviews reported in the middle 1980s through

the early 1990s, it was reported that cytotoxic chemotherapy had dismal response rates of approximately 4%
to 8%.4–6 However, recent studies of chemotherapy in
HRPC have demonstrated greater evidence of benefit,
both because of new drugs and because of changes in
how activity is assessed in Phase II and III trials.7 For
instance, reductions 50% in prostatic-specific antigen
(PSA) levels correlated with improvements in pain and
disease control and were associated with improvements
in survival.8 In the middle 1990s, 2 groups of investigators demonstrated that mitoxantrone and corticosteroids had a palliative benefit compared with steroids
alone in patients with HRPC.9,10 Consequently, mitoxantrone was approved for the palliative treatment of bone
pain from metastatic prostate cancer.
Taxanes represented the next important milestone
in the treatment of HRPC.7,11 Phase II trials of paclitaxel
and docetaxel, with or without estramustine, demonstrated promising response rates.11,12 In 2004, 2 large,
randomized, Phase III trials demonstrated for the first
time a survival benefit to docetaxel-based chemotherapy in HRPC.13,14 In Southwest Oncology Group
(SWOG) trial 9916, the regimen of docetaxel 60 mg/m2
every 3 weeks plus estramustine 280 mg 3 times daily
on Days 1 through 5 was compared with the regimen of
mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus prednisone
5 mg twice daily in patients with HRPC.13 In the TAX
327 study, 1006 patients with HRPC were randomized
to 1 of 3 arms: docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for
10 cycles, docetaxel 30 mg/m2 weekly (for 5 of 6 weeks)
for 5 cycles, or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks
for 10 cycles.14 All 3 groups received prednisone 5 mg
twice daily. Together, those studies demonstrated a
significant improvement in overall survival, time to disease progression, pain control, and PSA response with
docetaxel-based chemotherapy given every 3 weeks
compared with mitoxantrone. Because of those trials,
docetaxel every 3 weeks with prednisone recently obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a standard, first-line chemotherapy
regimen for patients with HRPC.
Despite such progress, the median survival benefit in
each of those trials was between 2 months and 3 months,
and survival remained disappointingly short.13,14 In
addition, a significant proportion of patients did not
benefit from docetaxel-based chemotherapy, notably
those with measurable disease. In both SWOG 9916 and
TAX 327, the proportions of patients with measurable
disease who experienced at least a partial response
were 17% and 12%, respectively, which was not statistically significantly better than mitoxantrone.13,14 Thus,
opportunities clearly exist to improve the outcome of
patients with HRPC who receive treatment with docetaxel-based chemotherapy.

Platinum drugs have a long history of use in many
cancers, including prostate cancer.15 Although earlier
studies suggested a lack of activity, more recent studies
using palliation and PSA endpoints have suggested a
greater degree of clinical benefit.16–33 In addition, several recent clinical trials have combined carboplatin
with taxanes and demonstrated promising results.34–36
Finally, a new platinum analogue, satraplatin, has
demonstrated intriguing activity in HRPC and is being
tested in a large randomized study in the second-line
chemotherapy setting.37,38
The mechanisms by which advanced prostate cancer progresses from a hormone-sensitive state to a hormone-refractory state remain unclear.39 Many potential
mechanisms have been proposed by which prostate cancer cells proliferate in the androgen-deprived environment, including amplification of the androgen receptor
(AR) gene,40 increased AR protein stability with hypersensitivity to low androgen levels,41 and activation of mutant
AR by different ligands.42–44 Growth factors and cytokines
also may activate AR.45 Recently, neuroendocrine (NE)
differentiation has been proposed as an important factor
that contributes to the emergence of HRPC.46
The link between the biology of NE differentiation
in prostate cancer and the activity of platinum-based
chemotherapy has been explored in at least 1 study.19
However, much remains to be understood about the
extent to which NE differentiation contributes to a
potential clinical subtype of cancer for which platinum
drugs may have a role. Therefore, the objectives of the
current study were to review the biology of NE differentiation in prostate cancer, to review trials that evaluated
platinum as single agents or in combination, and to
look to the future of platinum agents in the management of HRPC.

NE DIFFERENTIATION IN HRPC
The concept of NE differentiation of prostate cancer has
caused confusion among clinicians and needs to be
defined more clearly. Epithelial components of the normal prostate include luminal secretory cells, basal cells,
and a third minor component of NE cells. NE cells are
distributed widely in the normal prostate with only an
occasional cell per gland or duct.47 In addition, NE cells
are present in prostate cancer specimens. An uncommon scenario is one in which all cancer cells of the
prostate show NE differentiation. These scenarios
include small cell carcinoma and carcinoid tumor, both
of which are observed rarely in the prostate. In a more
general sense, NE differentiation of prostate cancer
refers to the presence of scattered, individual NE cells or
small nests of NE cells among the more abundant, nonNE secretory-type cancer cells in conventional adeno-

carcinomas.48,49 According to the latter definition,
nearly all adenocarcinomas of the prostate demonstrate
some degree of NE differentiation.50
NE cancer cells, unlike non-NE, secretory-type cancer cells, do not express AR.51 Consequently, although
ADT induces apoptosis of the androgen-dependent, secretory-type cancer cells (which express AR), ADT actually may enrich for NE cancer cells, which appear to be
postmitotic. Therefore, ADT cannot eliminate all cancer
cells, and it generally is not considered curative. Furthermore, NE cells that survive in this androgen-deprived
environment may establish paracrine networks to stimulate androgen-independent proliferation of the secretorytype cancer cells, leading to progressive HRPC.
Similarly, results from other studies suggest that ADT
may induce NE differentiation and that NE differentiation contributes to the emergence of HRPC.52–55 For
instance, NE differentiation is increased in high-grade
and high-stage localized tumors48,56,57 and is increased
even more in androgen-deprived52 and hormone-refractory cancers.53 In addition, it has been demonstrated that
levels of circulating chromogranin A (CgA), which is a
product of prostate NE cells, are higher in patients with
prostate cancer than in patients with benign prostatic
conditions. In patients with prostate cancer, CgA correlates with both clinical disease stage and the degree to
which the cancer has become hormone refractory.58 Positive immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue for
CgA is an independent predictor of cancer progression in
well differentiated and moderately differentiated prostate
cancers.59 In patients with hormone-refractory disease,
elevated serum CgA is a significant predictor of poor
prognosis independent of serum PSA and other prognostic factors.53,54,58,60–63 Finally, in a gene-expression profiling experiment of primary prostate cancers, Singh et al
demonstrated that the gene for CgA is 1 of 5 genes that
correlate strongly with Gleason score and that this 5gene-expression model alone accurately predicted outcome after radical prostatectomy.64
The function of NE differentiation has been studied
extensively. NE cells secrete biogenic amines, neuropeptides, and cytokines,46 and the non-NE tumor cells
express receptors for many NE cell products.65–71 In
vitro, some NE cell products stimulate the proliferation
of prostate cancer cells.47,50,72 For instance, interleukin 8
(IL-8), which is an angiogenic and mitogenic factor for
many tumors, promotes androgen-independent proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro.73 Tissue studies
similarly have demonstrated that NE cells in prostate
cancer produce IL-8 and that non-NE tumor cells
express increased levels of the IL-8 receptor, CXCR1,74
suggesting that NE differentiation may be 1 of the factors that contribute to the progression of prostate cancer
in a paracrine fashion.75–77

479

In addition to cell culture and tissue studies, transgenic and xenograft mouse models have provided additional evidence for the significance of NE differentiation
in prostate cancer.78,79 In the CWR22 xenograft tumor
model, there was a significant increase in the number of
NE cells after castration that preceded the increase in
tumor cell proliferation.79 In the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) tumor model,
recurrent tumors after castration also were associated
with increased NE differentiation.78 LNCaP xenograft
tumors normally do not survive in castrated hosts, but
an allograft mouse NE tumor (NE-10) implanted on the
opposite flank could support LNCaP xenograft tumor in
castrated mice, providing strong evidence for the function of NE differentiation in androgen-independent proliferation of prostate cancer.80 In an uncastrated host,
the same NE cells appear to enhance migration and
invasion of LNCaP tumor cells.81
Targeting NE cells in HRPC, thus, may provide a
novel approach to the treatment of this disease. It is
known that platinum has activity against epithelial cancers with NE differentiation. Together with etoposide or
irinotecan, it generates the highest response rates in
small cell lung cancer and is the established first-line
treatment option for this disease.82 Pure small cell carcinoma of the prostate is a rare disease, and its management generally is similar to that for other extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas. Because most patients with pure small cell prostate carcinoma present
with metastatic disease at diagnosis, treatment usually
consists of cisplatin and etoposide.
It is noteworthy that certain NE carcinomas, such
as carcinoids, pancreatic islet cell tumors, and paragangliomas, generally are not sensitive to platinum
agents.83,84 In contrast to small cell carcinomas, this second group of tumors usually involves the gastrointestinal tract and generally has a more indolent clinical
course, although this may be widely variable. Generally,
somatostatin analogues and surgery represent the
mainstay of treatment for such metastatic NE tumors,
and chemotherapy drugs like streptozocin, dacarbazine,
5-fluorouracil, and doxorubicin demonstrate modest
response rates.83,84 A notable subset of patients with
pancreatic endocrine or carcinoid tumors, however, will
demonstrate an atypical presentation with numerous
mitoses and areas of necrosis. Two trials of cisplatin and
etoposide in 45 and 32 evaluable patients produced
response rates of 67% and 53%, respectively.85,86
Whether there is a distinct clinical phenotype of a
more NE-differentiated cancer remains unknown. Patients with poorly differentiated prostate cancers who
are diagnosed later with unusual visceral metastases,
such as hepatic or brain, are often assumed to have
some component of NE differentiation but rarely

differentiation in HRPC in these metastatic sites. In
addition, patients with either low or no PSA production
per volume of cancer also are considered to fit this phenotype. Clinical trials of prostate cancer sometimes
exclude patients who have very low PSA values; thus, it
is possible that the true efficacy of current drugs has
been underestimated in clinical trials. If the importance
of NE differentiation of prostate cancer is confirmed
over time, then the use of chemotherapies that are targeted specifically against NE cells may be a reasonable,
added option in the armamentarium for the treatment
of prostate cancer, providing a rationale for combining
platinum drugs with other drugs that are directed more
specifically at the non-NE epithelial cancer cells.

PLATINUM DRUGS AS FIRST-LINE CHEMOTHERAPY
IN PROSTATE CANCER
Single-Agent Cisplatin and Carboplatin
Platinum-based chemotherapy has been evaluated both
as a single agent and in combination regimens for the
treatment of HRPC (Table 1). In the pre-PSA era, most
trials used cisplatin. In 1979, Yagoda et al treated 25 HRPC
patients with 50 to 75 mg/m2 of single-agent cisplatin every 3 weeks and reported a measurable partial response
rate of 12%.87 When National Prostate Cancer Project criteria were used, 24% of patients achieved stable disease.
In a subsequent study that used a lower dose of 50 mg/
m2 every 3 weeks, no responses were reported among 18
patients, and the investigators concluded that the regimen was not active.88 However, 4 contemporaneous studies that employed weekly cisplatin reported measurable

response rates ranging from 10% to 43%.26,27,29,31 In a
1993 review article that summarized results from 209
patients who received cisplatin, Yagoda and Petrylak calculated an overall 12% partial response rate (95% confidence interval, 4–20%).4 However, closer examination of
the 2 trials that evaluated every-3-week cisplatin suggests
that the chemotherapy dose used was low and that
patient selection likely influenced the activity level. For
instance, in studies that used a higher dose (1 mg/kg per
week) for 6 weeks, responses were reported in multiple
soft tissue sites, including lymph nodes, liver, and lung, in
addition to the more common site of bone.26,29
Carboplatin is second-generation platinum chemotherapy that has a toxicity profile distinct from cisplatin.
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) treated
29 patients who had HRPC with doses of carboplatin ranging from 250 mg/m2 to 400 mg/m2 based on renal function and prior radiation.89 One of 5 patients (20%) who
had bidimensionally measurable disease in that study
had a partial response, 1 of 24 patients who had an abnormal bone scan had >50% regression in the number of
sites with abnormal tracer uptake, and 3 of 24 patients
experienced an improvement in their clinical status. In
that trial, although the investigators concluded that carboplatin had no significant activity, the dose used was
low by today’s standards and was not administered
according to current area under the curve (AUC) methods. In addition, most of the patients in that study, in contrast to prior studies with cisplatin, had bone metastases
and, thus, were not evaluable by the standard, cross-sectional imaging techniques that were available at the time.
In the post-PSA era, 4 clinical trials have been performed with weekly carboplatin, and all of those studies
showed evidence of activity as measured by clinical ben-

efit, measurable response, or declines in PSA. Canobbio
et al demonstrated that weekly carboplatin at a dose of
150 mg/m2 allowed greater dose intensity compared
with a schedule of every 3 or 4 weeks.24 Responses in
that study represented a composite of both measurable
and evaluable disease (using PSA and prostatic acid
phosphatase) and were reported in 17% of patients. In
another study, Miglietta et al used the same weekly
schedule in 35 patients and reported that 10 patients
(28%) had a decline 50% in PSA, and the mean
response duration was 6.6 months.23 In a third study by
Jungi et al, 27 patients with HRPC received carboplatin
at a dose of 400 mg/m2 once every 28 days.25 Decreased
pain, an improved performance status, and stabilization
of metastases were observed in 13 patients, and the
investigators reported a clinical benefit response rate of
48%. This included patients who demonstrated improvements in performance status, reductions in pain,
and stable metastases. In addition, 2 of 24 evaluable
patients (8%) in that study demonstrated a PSA
response, although the investigators reported no clear
association between clinical benefit and PSA response.
Castagneto et al recently reported a study at the
2006 Prostate Cancer Symposium in San Francisco.
Twenty-seven patients with HRPC received carboplatin
at a dose of 150 mg weekly for 3 of 4 weeks, and 26.9%
of patients experienced a decline 50% in PSA after
therapy. Hence, it appears that carboplatin has definite
though moderate activity in HRPC, whether it is administered weekly or monthly and even when it is dosed
by nonrenal methods. No recent trials of carboplatin
alone have been reported using AUC dosing.

Multiagent Regimens that Include Cisplatin and Carboplatin
Earlier trials combined cisplatin with other drugs that
were believed to be active in HRPC. For instance, in a
Phase II trial of doxorubicin and cisplatin, significant
improvements were demonstrated in prostatic acid

phosphatase in 21% of patients, and clinical improvement was observed in 24% of patients.18 Additional trials
have combined cisplatin with doxorubicin plus 5-flourouracil,16 with strontium-89 (89Sr),22,30 with etoposide
plus pirarubicin,32 with mitoxantrone,33 with estramustine plus etoposide,19 and with calcitriol plus dexamethasone.90 Some regimens have been targeted specifically
against small cell carcinoma, with cisplatin and etoposide as the core elements of the regimen. For instance,
Papandreou et al treated 38 patients with metastatic
pure or mixed small cell carcinoma of the prostate with
doxorubicin, etoposide, and cisplatin and reported a
61% partial response rate.91 However, in that study, the
addition of doxorubicin also increased toxicity significantly, and the regimen was not considered tolerable.
A randomized Phase III trial compared the radiopharmaceutical drug 89Sr alone or in combination with
cisplatin in 70 patients with HRPC and painful bone metastases. Cisplatin was infused 3 times over 11 days up
to a total dose of 50mg/m2 prior to and after 89Sr. Study
endpoints were palliation of bone pain at 2 months,
new onset of bone pain, progression of bone metastases, and survival. Pain improvement at 2 months was
reported as 91% versus 63% favoring combination therapy. Progression of bone metastases was 64% in the
combination arm versus 27% with radioisotope alone.
There was no difference in new onset of painful bone
lesions or survival.22
In the past decade, docetaxel with or without estramustine became a platform on which other drugs were
added, although recent randomized trials have questioned the role of estramustine.11 A series of contemporary clinical trials added carboplatin to a taxane (either
docetaxel or paclitaxel) and estramustine in the management of HRPC (Table 2). Results have been encouraging in Phase II trials, with PSA declines 50% in 60% to
100% of patients and objective response rates from 45%
to 65% in the subset of patients with measurable dis-

ease.34,36,92–95 The measurable response rate gives a further indication that carboplatin may have a role in the
front-line management of certain patients with HRPC.
Of course, care in interpreting these trials is needed,
because these were small Phase II trials with highly
selected patients, many of whom had a good performance status.
One of those Phase II trials was a multicenter trial
conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B evaluating the activity of estramustine, docetaxel, and carboplatin in patients with metastatic HRPC. The regimen
included 5 days of estramustine, docetaxel at 70 mg/m2,
and carboplatin AUC (5) administered every 3 weeks.
Because of the myelosuppression associated with this
combination, prophylactic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor was used in all patients. Forty patients were
enrolled and received a median of 7 cycles of chemotherapy. PSA declines >50% were noted in 68% of evaluable patients, whereas measurable responses were
noted in 52% of the 21 patients with measurable disease,
including 1 patient who had a complete measurable
response to therapy. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was uncommon and included neutropenia in 23% of patients,
thrombocytopenia in 13% of patients, and fatigue in
13% of patients. Febrile neutropenia occurred only in 1
patient (3%). The median time to progression was 8.1
months, and overall survival was 19 months. Although
the regimen seemed promising and was tolerated reasonably well, it remains unclear from this and other
Phase II trials the extent to which carboplatin enhances
the efficacy of docetaxel and estramustine. No Phase III
trials currently are ongoing to determine whether carboplatin enhances response or survival when it is added to
docetaxel used as first-line chemotherapy.

Novel Platinum Drugs Including Satraplatin
Newer formulations of platinum drugs are in clinical development for the management of HRPC and other cancers. An excellent recent review has been published that
summarizes newer platinum compounds and the different strategies to improve platinum formulations.96
Satraplatin and oxaliplatin represent 2 drugs that are
based on novel structures with altered, stable ligands
and demonstrate activity in cisplatin-resistant cancers.
Both react with DNA at the same sites as cisplatin and
carboplatin, but they form DNA adducts that have different chemical structures.
Satraplatin is the first orally available platinum drug
that has shown cytotoxic activity in vitro in cisplatinresistant cell lines. A planned Phase III trial of satraplatin plus prednisone versus prednisone alone was
initiated several years ago by the European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer but was stopped
early because of withdrawal of support from the spon-

sor. However, 50 patients had been enrolled at the time
of study closure. An intriguing report on the clinical outcomes of those 50 patients suggested a significant benefit in progression-free survival that attained statistical
significance. On the basis of these promising data and
the lack of cross-resistance with other chemotherapy
drugs typically used in this setting, a large, randomized
Phase III trial was initiated with satraplatin as secondline chemotherapy, as noted below.
Oxaliplatin is a newer platinum agent that has a
more favorable toxicity profile and evidence of activity
in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. Droz et al performed a
multicenter Phase II trial in 54 patients with metastatic
HRPC who were randomized to receive oxaliplatin either alone or with 5-fluorouracil. Greater than 50% of
those patients had received prior chemotherapy, including some who received cisplatin (although none had
received prior docetaxel or paclitaxel.) Despite such
heavy pretreatment, PSA declines were noted in 11%
and 19% of patients in each arm. Hematologic toxicity
was mild to moderate, and single-agent oxaliplatin, in
particular, was well tolerated.
Other platinum-based chemotherapy drugs have
been studied in patients with metastatic cancer. ZD0473 is a novel platinum compound that has demonstrated activity in cisplatin-resistant ovarian and lung
cancer cell lines.97 Modest response rates have been
reported in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian
and small cell lung cancers.98,99 Lobaplatin is another
novel platinum compound that appears to have some
activity in cisplatin-resistant cancer cell lines.100
An alternative method for improving the efficacy of
platinum drugs is to improve delivery of the drug to the
tumor itself. One approach is to incorporate the agent
into a liposome, whereas another approach is to attach
the active agent to an inert compound. Two liposomal
platinum drugs in development are aroplatin and SPI77.101,102 Like other novel platinum agents, both liposomal formulations have shown activity in cisplatin-resistant cell lines and are in clinical development. Earlyphase trials have demonstrated minimal myelosuppression, although efficacy studies are ongoing. Two platinum polymers in clinical development include AP-5280
and AP-5346.103 AP-5280 is platinum complex linked to
a polymer compound and has been evaluated in a Phase
I trial.103 The polymer conjugate appears to decrease
clearance of drug in plasma, but it did not appear to
enhance toxicity.

ond-line regimen that is considered a single standard of
care. In the absence of a clinical trial in the second-line
setting, mitoxantrone and prednisone after failure on
docetaxel, and vice versa, has been considered a reasonable choice. However, several recent reports describing
the response to second-line mitoxantrone chemotherapy have suggested that overall activity is modest and
ranges from 5% to 15% using PSA declines of 50% as
the primary endpoint. Other cytotoxic agents have been
used, including vinorelbine, etoposide, doxorubicin,
estramustine, and cyclophosphamide. Data supporting
their use remain limited or nonexistent, but expected
response rates are from <10% to 20%, and response duration is likely to be short. Other nonresearch options
for this patient population include radiopharmaceuticals, further second-line hormone manipulation, and
supportive care only.
In this environment of limited choices, patient participation in clinical trials remains a priority. Nonetheless,
some patients are unable or unwilling to enroll in a clinical trial. In this context, we treated 4 consecutive patients
who had not responded to or progressed on taxanebased chemotherapy and noted what appeared to be
greater than expected responses to docetaxel plus lowdose carboplatin chemotherapy.35 Treatment consisted
of docetaxel at a dose of 60 mg/m2 to 70 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC (4 or 5) every 3 weeks. All 4 patients experienced declines >50% in PSA and survived another 4.5 to
12 months after starting this regimen.
Because of these observations, we initiated a prospective, multicenter clinical trial of docetaxel 60 mg/
m2 and carboplatin AUC (4) every 3 weeks in patients
who progressed on prior docetaxel chemotherapy.
Patients were required to have received 2 cycles of
docetaxel and demonstrated PSA or clinical progression
of disease while on treatment or within 45 days of their
last dose. Final analysis of that trial will attempt to correlate response to serum markers of NE differentiation,
including CgA and neuron-specific enolase.
Satraplatin is being investigated as second-line
chemotherapy in a Phase III, international, randomized
trial called Satraplatin and Prednisone Against Refractory Cancer (SPARC). In total, 912 patients have been
randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive satraplatin plus
prednisone versus prednisone alone. The primary endpoint is time to progression using a composite endpoint,
and secondary endpoints include overall survival and
time to pain progression. It is noteworthy that patients
are not required to have received docetaxel as first-line
chemotherapy, because this trial was initiated prior to
FDA approval of docetaxel for this indication.
In September 2006, preliminary results of SPARC
were released and suggested a 40% reduction in the risk
of disease progression in the satraplatin-treated group

483

compared with the control group. A notably better progression-free survival was observed in the satraplatin
arm and was highly statistically significant (P < .00001).
Benefit was reported whether or not patients had
received prior docetaxel, and toxicity was considered
mild to moderate.104 Final data are pending.

CONCLUSIONS
Platinum chemotherapy has been used for many decades for many cancers and has demonstrated clear benefit in the palliative and/or curative treatment of
diseases like testicular, ovarian, and lung cancers. Its activity in prostate cancer has been a subject of uncertainty. Early reports from the 1980s and early 1990s
suggested that cisplatin and carboplatin had no meaningful clinical activity. However, those trials were conducted in the pre-PSA era and used ineffective methods
for determining response, particularly in patients w ho
had prostate cancer that involved bone. In the middle
1990s, results from several small trials suggested that
carboplatin provided some palliative benefit and induced declines in PSA comparable to other active agents
in this disease, such as mitoxantrone and vinorelbine.
Based on a belief that carboplatin offered some additional benefit, at least 6 clinical trials involving 272
patients added carboplatin to estramustine and a taxane
have been reported in the past 7 years and showed high
response rates. The question that has not been
answered is whether and the degree to which carboplatin actually improves progression-free or overall survival
in patients with HRPC.
So, is there a role of platinum chemotherapy in the
management of HRPC? We believe that there is a body
of evidence to support the use of platinum drugs in
patients with prostate cancer. In patients with advanced
pure or predominant small cell cancers of the prostate,
cisplatin-based regimens represent the standard of care.
In more typical patients with HRPC who have progressive, metastatic disease, docetaxel chemotherapy represents the current standard of care. Although combinations of docetaxel with carboplatin have shown
promising activity in the initial chemotherapeutic management of HRPC, such combinations have not demonstrated a clear additional benefit in this situation.
However, in the second-line chemotherapeutic management of HRPC, there is no accepted standard of
care, and carboplatin may have clinically relevant activity in this setting. An ongoing Phase III trial of the novel
platinum satraplatin will be reported soon in the second-line chemotherapy setting.
Because we recognize that a specific subtype of
patients with HRPC may benefit more from platinum
agents than others, ongoing efforts will help to clarify

these distinct phenotypes. Currently, we are conducting
a pooled analysis of the Phase II trials of taxanes with
estramustine and carboplatin to assess whether specific
subgroups are more likely to respond to these regimens.
We also are completing the trial mentioned above in
which we are attempting to correlate response to docetaxel plus carboplatin with serum markers of NE differentiation.
