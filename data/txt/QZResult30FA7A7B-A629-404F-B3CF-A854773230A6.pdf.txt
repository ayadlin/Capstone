BACKGROUND: Statins and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in some studies. The objective of this study was to quantify the relative risk of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) as a risk factor for CRC and to estimate whether this risk may be modified by long-term use of
NSAIDs or statins. METHODS: The Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study is a population-based, casecontrol study of incident colorectal cancer in northern Israel and controls matched by age, sex, clinic, and ethnicity.
Personal histories of IBD and medication use were measured by structured, in-person interview. The relative risk of
IBD and effect modification by statins and NSAIDs were quantified by conditional and unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 1921 matched pairs of CRC cases and controls, a self-reported history of IBD was associated
with a 1.9-fold increased risk of CRC (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-3.26). Long-term statin use was associated
with a reduced risk of both IBD-associated CRC (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.78) and non-IBD CRC (OR ¼
0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.62). Stratified analysis suggested that statins may be more protective among those with IBD (ratio of OR ¼ 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01-1.31; P ¼ .51), although not statistically significant. NSAID use in patients with a history
of IBD was suggestive of reduced risk of CRC but did not reach statistical significance (OR ¼ 0.47; 95% CI, 0.12-1.86).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CRC was elevated 1.9-fold in patients with IBD. Long-term statin use was associated with

KEYWORDS: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer, statins, chemoprevention.

The first reports of intestinal cancer occurrence in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were published 80 years ago.1 The

IBD-associated cancer risk has been identified in both referral center studies2-6 and population-based studies.7-11 The
magnitude of risk observed in studies from referral centers generally exceeds the risk reported in population-based studies.
Thus, the true risk for malignancy in IBD remains imprecisely estimated. Additional evidence from population-based
studies can help quantify the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in IBD patients, offer prognostic information, and determine
appropriate surveillance algorithms based on level of risk.
Research investigating the role of potential chemopreventive agents as a means to reduce the complications and
deaths due to colorectal cancer has identified aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), calcium,12,13
hormone replacement therapy,14-16 and statins as potentially active drugs.17-24 Balancing potential risks and benefits of
chemoprevention can be dramatically influenced by the risk of the disease, and the equation is not demonstrably in
favor of chemoprevention for average-risk patients at this point in time. However, high-risk populations such as those
with IBD might benefit from chemoprevention if specific agents that reduce the risk of CRC in these patients can be
identified and validated. Studies in high-risk populations such as those with IBD can be difficult to execute, in part due

to the smaller study populations at risk, making it hard
to study several variables simultaneously and to adjust
for potential confounders.
The aims of the current study were to determine the
prevalence of IBD in a population-based, case-control study
of CRC in Israel, quantify the relative risk of IBD as a risk
factor for CRC, evaluate the influence of aspirin, NSAID, or
statin use on the relative risk of IBD-associated CRC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer
(MECC) study is a population-based, case-control study
of incident colorectal cancer in northern Israel. Patients
were eligible for participation in this analysis if they had
received a diagnosis of colorectal cancer between March 31,
1998 and July 11, 2004, lived in a geographically defined
area of northern Israel, and provided written informed consent at the time of enrollment. Controls were identified
from the same source population with the use of the Clalit
Health Services (CHS) database. CHS is the largest healthcare provider in Israel and covers approximately 70% of the
older population (persons at least 60 years of age). Healthcare coverage in Israel is mandated and is provided by 4
groups akin to health maintenance organizations. Thus, all
study participants (patients and controls) had similar health
insurance and similar access to health services. Controls were
individually matched to patients according to the year of
birth, sex, primary clinic locations, and ethnic group (Jewish
vs non-Jewish). Potential controls were excluded if they had
a history of colorectal cancer.
Participants were interviewed to obtain demographic information and information about their personal
and family history of cancer, reproductive history, medical history, medication use, and health habits. They also
completed a dietary questionnaire. One pathologist confirmed diagnoses of colorectal cancer by means of a standardized pathologic review. The institutional review boards
at the Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, and the University
of Michigan, Ann Arbor, approved all procedures.
This was a secondary analysis of an existing data set
(MECC) originally collected for another purpose.
Exposure Data
Participants were asked to recall each medication they had
used for at least 5 years, and statin use was determined on
the basis of this list. Statin use was defined as positive if
the patient recalled use of medication for at least 5 years

and negative for never users or those with less than 5 years
of use. Statin use was recorded from an in-person interview that asked participants to list all medications used for
at least 5 years. Prior published work describes the correspondence between self-reported statin use and pharmacy
records.22 Individual medications were separately
recorded for all cases and controls but without corresponding data for duration of use. Specific exposure to
simvastatin and pravastatin was measured based on the
response to specify ‘‘other medications.’’ The use of aspirin and other NSAIDs was also assessed; information
gathered included dose, duration of use, and indication
for use. For analyses of aspirin or other NSAIDs, exposure
was defined as at least once weekly for greater than 3 years.
A complete, 3-generation pedigree and information on
the family history of cancer were also recorded for each
participant. The report of colon or rectal cancer in at least
one first-degree relative was considered to represent a family history of colorectal cancer.
Ethnic group was determined by assessing participants’ religious affiliation, self-described ethnic group, and
the country of birth of their parents and grandparents.
Ashkenazi Jewish heritage was determined as previously described.25
A participant’s history of inflammatory bowel disease was elicited by asking whether he or she had ever been
diagnosed by a physician with Crohn disease, ulcerative
colitis (UC), or had ever had bowel surgery for inflammatory bowel disease.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS
software (version 8.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), and
all reported P-values are 2-sided. Contingency table analysis was used to assess crude associations between inflammatory bowel disease and the risk of colorectal cancer.
To account for the study design, matched analyses
were performed with the use of both contingency-table
methods and conditional logistic regression. Because there
were no differences in matched and unmatched analysis,
we report the results of unmatched analysis with unconditional logistic regression models for increased power.
These techniques were used to assess the main association
between IBD and the risk of CRC, to adjust for confounding, and to identify potential effect modification.

available at the time of a planned analysis. Sixty patients
were identified with a self-reported history of IBD. Ashkenazi Jews constituted the largest fraction of patients, a
finding corresponding to the demographic distribution in
Israel and the known increased risk of colorectal cancer
among Ashkenazi compared with non-Ashkenazi Jews. As
previously reported in these data, statin use of at least 5
years’ duration was recorded in 6% of patients and 12%
of controls. The vast majority of these patients and controls used simvastatin. A summary of demographic data is
presented in Table 1.
The overall prevalence of self-reported IBD among
persons with colon cancer was 2.0%. Compared with the
control population, those with colorectal cancer had a sig-

nificantly increased prevalence of IBD (2.0% vs 1.1%).
Thus, in patients with a self-reported history of IBD, the
unmatched odds ratio (OR) of colorectal cancer was 1.91
(95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-3.26) (Table 2). The
majority of this risk was in patients with self-reported
ulcerative colitis where the unmatched odds ratio of colorectal cancer was 2.21 (95% CI, 1.22-4.01) and not
increased in Crohn disease (Table 2). Remaining analyses
were restricted to the broader definition of IBD and not
subtypes (Crohn or ulcerative colitis). After adjustment
for potential confounders (including age, ethnic group,
presence or absence of sports participation, level of vegetable consumption, smoking status, and history of colorectal cancer in a first-degree relative), the association
between IBD and elevated risk of colorectal cancer
remained significantly elevated (Table 3).

Among persons with self-reported IBD, 50% of
colorectal cancers were left sided, 30% were right sided,
and 20% were rectal cancers. No strong association was
seen between tumor location and IBD (Table 4). A total
of 17.2% of IBD patients had tumors showing high
microsatellite instability (MSI-H) compared with 10.8%
of sporadic tumors (OR ¼ 1.73; 95% CI, 0.65-4.59).

although this difference was not significant (P ¼ .267)
(Table 4). IBD patients also had a similar distribution of
tumors by stage compared with non-IBD cases (Table 4).
Effect modification was assessed for use of NSAIDs,
aspirin, or statins. As previously reported,22 the long-term
use of statins (vs never use of statins) was associated with a
significantly reduced risk of CRC overall (OR ¼ 0.49;
95% CI, 0.39-0.62), which remained significant after
adjustment for potential confounders (including age, ethnic group, presence or absence of sports participation,
level of vegetable consumption, and history of colorectal
cancer in a first-degree relative). Statin use was associated
with a profoundly reduced risk of IBD-associated CRC
(OR ¼ 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.78). After adjustment for
potential confounders, the odds ratio remained strongly
suggestive of reduced risk of colorectal cancer, although
not statistically significant (OR ¼ 0.10; 95% CI, 0.011.31) (Table 5). Stratified analysis suggested that statins
may be more protective among those with IBD (ratio of
OR ¼ 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01-1.31; P ¼ .51), although not
statistically significant. When statin use was subdivided
by type, simvastatin was associated with a profoundly
reduced risk of IBD associated CRC (OR ¼ 0.05; 95%
CI, 0.004-0.54; P ¼ .014) compared with non-statin
users. Pravastatin use was similarly associated with a
reduced risk of CRC versus non-statin users but was not

DISCUSSION
In this population-based study, we have corroborated and
quantified the increased risk of colorectal carcinoma in
IBD patients. Among patients with a self-reported history
of IBD, the risk for CRC was increased by 1.9-fold compared with the control population. The majority of this
risk was in patients with a self-reported history of ulcerative colitis, where the risk of CRC was increased 2.2-fold.
A number of studies have reported elevated rates of
CRC in patients with IBD. A Swedish population-based
study spanning the years 1955 to 1989 found a relative
risk of 4.1 (95% CI, 2.7-5.8) for CRC in UC patients.10
Swedish data regarding colorectal carcinoma risk in
Crohn disease (CD) patients for the years 1965 to 1983
revealed a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 2.5 (95%
CI, 1.3-4.3).8 A Danish population-based study spanning
13 years (1977-1989) found a risk ratio of 1.8 (95% CI,
1.3-2.4) for CRC in UC patients.26 A population-based
study from Manitoba, Canada11 found an incidence rate
ratio for UC of 2.75 (95% CI, 1.91-3.97), for CD of 2.64

1644

(95% CI, 1.69-4.12), and for IBD of 2.71 (95%CI, 2.043.59). These studies all report elevated risk ratios for CRC
in patients with IBD. Several studies have also confirmed
similar incidence rates of CRC amongst UC and
CD.4,6,27 The only American data are from a populationbased study from Olmstead County, which observed a
trend toward increased CRC risk in the CD cohort (SIR
1.9; 95% CI, 0.7-4.1).28
Other studies from Europe,29 North America,30 and
31
Israel refute the association between UC or CD and
CRC. The conflicting results may be owing to differences
in local treatment policies. In the Denmark and Olmstead
County studies, maintenance treatment with 5-aminoslicylates and surgical resection rates are high. Proctocolectomy rates in Copenhagen were approximately 20% after
20 years for both UC and CD patients, which are higher
than those in Israel and many other jurisdictions. Low
cancer risk in these 2 populations may be due to maintenance treatment with mesalamine, high proctocolectomy
rates, or other factors.
Colonic inflammation is thought to be the primary
risk factor for CRC in patients with IBD.8 In our study,
we could not confirm if patients with self-reported CD
had colonic or small bowel inflammation, whereas
patients with UC by definition have involvement of the
large bowel. Thus our finding of elevated risk of CRC in
UC is consistent with the theory of colonic inflammation

as the risk factor for CRC. Patients with CD in our study
may have had small bowel involvement, which is not
believed to be a significant risk factor for CRC.
We show a nearly equal distribution of cancers
throughout the colon in persons with IBD, similar to
those without a history of IBD. This is consistent with our
understanding of tumorigenesis in IBD patients. IBD
patients at greatest risk of CRC are those with pancolitis,
and one would expect tumors to be evenly distributed
throughout the colon. Karlen10 had shown that of UC
patients with CRC 94% had total colitis and those with
rectal cancer 74% had total colitis. Jess28 had reported
CRC distribution throughout the colon in both UC and
CD patients. In their 6 patients with UC, CRC was
located in the rectum (2 cases), sigmoid (1 case), and
ascending colon (1 case). In their 6 patients with CD,
CRC was located in the rectum (2 cases), descending colon (1 case), and cecum (2 cases).
Stage of colon cancer denotes the extent of disease at
time of diagnosis and correlates with prognosis. Persons
with IBD and CRC had a similar distribution of lesions
by stage compared with non-IBD persons. Since patients
with IBD are expected to undergo regular endoscopic
surveillance, we would potentially expect tumors to be
identified at an earlier stage. This is in contrast to our observation of a CRC stage distribution that closely approximates those without IBD. This suggests the possibility
that patients with IBD either did not adhere to the recommended endoscopic surveillance guidelines or that surveillance is not effective at identifying earlier stage tumors in
IBD. The literature supports the hypothesis that inadequate adherence may be a more likely explanation than
ineffective endoscopic surveillance. Several studies from
Europe32-34 and New Zealand35 found that less than 50%
of gastroenterologists adhere to national surveillance

In patients with IBD, CRC arises in a field of
chronically inflamed mucosa, characterized by aneuploidy, loss of heterozygosity, hypermethylation, and p53
mutations. Chronic inflammation has been proposed to
constitute a risk factor for the development of MSI-H
cancers.36-38 We report that 17% of self-reported IBD
patients had tumors showing high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) compared with 11% of sporadic tumors,
yielding an odds ratio of 1.73 (0.65-4.59). Previous studies have reported a wide range of MSI-H frequency in
IBD-associated neoplasia (1%-45%).36,37,39-44 Several
factors contribute to this discrepancy, including differing
microsatellite marker panels, number of microsatellite

markers used, and classifications of MSI among the different studies. A more recent study45 reports a prevalence of
MSHI-H in IBD neoplasia from 15% to 17% in a largely
Caucasian US-based population, consistent with our
results. A slightly lower frequency of MSI-H (8.3%) in
IBD neoplasia was found in a French population study in
2007.38 Our results suggest that chronic inflammation
may be worth investigating as a risk factor for development of MSI-H CRC in IBD, and that the biologic
behavior of IBD-associated cancers may differ from sporadic CRC.
Previous research has suggested the risk of CRC is
related to duration, extent, and severity of IBD, although
this has not been shown consistently in all studies. We
were not able to define IBD duration, extent, or severity
in our database.
Our study indicates that statin use is associated with
a significant reduction in the risk of CRC in patients with
a self-reported history of inflammatory bowel disease. Statins are a class of agents designed to inhibit HMG-CoA
reductase, and they are effective in the management of
hypercholesterolemia. It has been hypothesized that statins may have chemopreventive activity against several
cancers, including colorectal cancer. Statin use has never
been assessed specifically in the IBD patient population as
a chemopreventive agent. We report that statin use for at
least 5 years was associated with a profoundly reduced risk
of IBD-associated CRC (OR ¼ 0.07; 95% CI, 0.010.78). This association was seen with both simvastatin
and pravastatin use. This is largely in agreement with previous studies assessing the impact of statins in average-risk
patients. Previous results from our group assessed the use
of statins in a population-based, case-control study of
patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer in northern
Israel. The use of statins for at least 5 years was associated
with a significantly reduced relative risk of colorectal cancer (OR ¼ 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.62).22 Another population-based study from Germany indicated a 64% CRC
risk reduction occurring within 1 to 4 years of statin
use.46 A nested case-control study of veterans with diabetes in the US national VA database showed a small but
statistically significant reduction in CRC (OR ¼ 0.91;
95% CI, 0.86-0.96).47 A cohort study from Manitoba,
Canada showed a nonsignificant protective effect of longterm statin use among patients with colorectal cancer
(incidence rate ratio [IRR] ¼ 0.89; 95% CI, 0.701.13).48 Similarly, 2 nested case-control studies from
Quebec, Canada23 and the Netherlands24 showed a nonsignificant protective effect of statin use among patients

1645

with colorectal cancer (OR ¼ 0.83; 95% CI, 0.37-1.89
and OR ¼ 0.87; 95% CI, 0.48-1.57). In contrast, an analysis of data from the General Practice Research database
found a minimally increased risk of colorectal cancer
among patients using statins for greater than 60
months.49
In our population, the use of NSAID and/or aspirin
in patients with a self-reported history of IBD was associated with a reduced risk of CRC, although not statistically
significant. Substantial evidence has shown that NSAIDs
and selective COX-2 inhibitors can reduce the incidence
and mortality of CRC.50 Randomized studies have shown
that aspirin usage decreases the recurrence of adenomas in
high-risk patients.17,18 In a retrospective case-control
study of UC patients with CRC at Mayo Clinic, the
authors identified over-the-counter aspirin (OR ¼ 0.3;
95% CI, 0.1-0.8) and NSAID (OR ¼ 0.1; 95% CI,
0.03-0.5) use as protective factors.51 The point estimate
for aspirin use is nearly identical to that found in our study
for NSAID and/or aspirin use. NSAID use was also
reported to reduce CRC mortality odds by 49% in a population of US military veterans with IBD.52 In contrast to
these trials, both the Women’s Health Study and a secondary analysis of the Physicians’ Health Study did not
observe any association with colorectal cancer after 5 to 10
years of treatment.53,54 IBD patients are often counseled
to avoid NSAIDs because they may be associated with disease flares. However, in our study NSAID use was similar
among controls with and without self-reported IBD.
The background prevalence of IBD was high in our
population at 1%. Studies in Ashkenazi Jews have consistently reported elevated prevalence and incidence rates for
both UC and CD, and this rate has increased over
time.55,56
Strengths of this study include the use of a population-based study design that takes advantage of age-,
gender-, ethnicity- and geographically (clinic)-matched
controls. By matching based on geographic location of
residence, our methodology likely reduced confounding
that may be present due to differences in socioeconomic
status in other studies. Our study has several limitations.
IBD diagnosis and medication exposure data were collected retrospectively by self-report and are therefore sensitive to recall bias. However, because participants are not
likely to expect that the use of statins is related to the risk
of colorectal cancer, any resulting misclassification is most
likely nondifferential and therefore would only attenuate
measured risks. Assessment of potential confounders was
also self-reported. We also were not able to define IBD

1646

duration, extent, or severity of disease and immunosuppressant medication use in our database as potential confounders. We did not have information on dose or
duration of use of statins and therefore could not assess
the data for a dose-response relation; however, statin type
was assessed. Limitations associated with all studies of this
design are intrinsic differences between the cases and controls (such as healthy behavior) that cannot be adjusted
for and remain as confounders.
In conclusion, this population-based study showed
that risk for CRC is elevated in older patients with IBD
approximately 1.9-fold and suggested that statins are associated with reduced risk of CRC in these patients. Our
findings are suggestive of an inverse association in a largely
Ashkenazi Jewish population, which needs to be replicated in other populations to assess generalizability. These
suggest potential for statins as a chemopreventative agent
in patients with IBD.
