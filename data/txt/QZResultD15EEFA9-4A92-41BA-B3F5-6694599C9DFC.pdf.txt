ABSTRACT
Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) present in tumor microenvironment
acts in a coordinated fashion to either suppress or promote tumor development.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of TGF-β1 on tumor
microenvironment are not well understood. Our clinical data showed a positive
association between TGF-β1 expression and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in
tumor microenvironment of breast cancer patients. Thus we employed starved NIH3T3
fibroblasts in vitro and 4T1 cells mixed with NIH3T3 fibroblasts xenograft model
in vivo to simulate nutritional deprivation of tumor microenvironment to explore
the effects of TGF-β1. We demonstrated that TGF-β1 protected NIH3T3 fibroblasts
from Star-induced growth inhibition, mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis.
Interestingly, TGF-β1 induced the formation of CAFs phenotype in starvation (Star)treated NIH3T3 fibroblasts and xenografted Balb/c mice, which promoted breast
cancer tumor growth. In both models, autophagy agonist rapamycin increased TGFβ1-induced protective effects and formation of CAFs phenotypes, while autophagy
inhibitor 3-methyladenine, Atg5 knockdown or TGF-β type I receptor kinase inhibitor
LY-2157299 blocked TGF-β1 induced these effects. Taken together, our results
indicated that TGF-β/Smad autophagy was involved in TGF-β1-induced protective
effects and formation of CAFs phenotype in tumor microenvironment, which may be
used as therapy targets in breast cancer.

They are myofibroblasts, or activated fibroblasts in the
tumor stroma, mostly characterized by the expression of
activated fibroblast markers, such as α-smooth muscle
actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-α
(FAP-α) [4]. It is widely assumed that myofibroblasts
may also develop from NIH3T3 fibroblasts, as both cell
types show more similarities than differences including
the expression of cytoskeleton proteins like FAP-α and
α-SMA [5]. Many researchers have reported that CAFs
facilitated tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis
[6–8]. Moreover, it is reported that FAP-α and calponin
can serve as a novel marker for pathologically diagnosing
the existence of microinvasion in ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) [9]. Emerging study indicates that transforming
growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a multifunctional cytokine

INTRODUCTION
Tumor microenvironment has emerged as an
important target for cancer therapy. For most solid
tumors, particularly carcinomas, their microenvironment
consists of the tumor cells themselves, endothelial cells,
immune cells and fibroblasts contribute to tumorigenesis
by secretion of cytokines and/or direct cell-cell contact
[1]. Importantly, the different cell types within the tumor
microenvironment communicate both between themselves
and with each other in order to support tumor growth [2].
In particular, a subpopulation of fibroblasts, the so-called
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), seems to activate
many aspects of tumorigenesis. CAFs are a subpopulation
of fibroblasts found in the tumor microenvironment [3],

that regulates the growth, differentiation and migration
of various types of cells [10], has been recognized as the
most potent inducer for the transformation of fibroblasts to
CAFs [11]. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated
that TGF-β1 is capable of activating α-SMA-negative
tumor stromal fibroblasts into α-SMA-positive CAFs [12,
13]. However, mechanisms for CAFs activation by TGF-β
in tumor microenvironment are not well understood.
Autophagy is a bulk lysosomal degradation pathway
that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components
including macromolecules (for example proteins,
glycogens, lipids and nucleotides) and organelles (for
example mitochondria, peroxisomes and endoplasmic
reticulum) [14]. During the initiation of autophagy, a
family of autophagy regulatory proteins activates the
formation of autophagosome. ATG5–ATG12 complex
and LC3 play a predominant role in the formation of
pre-autophagosome [15]. Another autophagy regulatory
protein Beclin 1 functions for localization of autophagic
proteins to a pre-autophagosomal structure. Beclin1induced autophagosome formation is controlled by the
inhibition of mTOR pathway and class-III pathway
(Atg6)/hVps34 [16, 17]. Autophagy is an internal
course of catabolism which is essential for cell growth,
development and cellular homeostasis under various stress
conditions including nutrient deprivation, growth factor
depletion, and hypoxia [18–21]. Moreover, It has been
reported that autophagy in certain tumor types including
breast cancer might be thus implicated in tumor promotion
in the later phase of tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, tumors
are the ecosystems of cancer cells and their stroma
coevolution [22]. Recently, the primary research focus on
autophagy in cancer has shifted from cancer cell-centric
to tumor stroma. Previous studies have reported that
autophagy in tumor stroma promoted tumor growth and
progression in conditions of hypoxia and metabolic stress
[23–25]. However, the function of autophagy in tumor
microenvironment is complicated, and its mechanisms are
still ambiguous.
Emerging studies have indicated that TGF-β1 might
be a potent activator of autophagy [26, 27]. The proautophagy effects of TGF-β1 have been well demonstrated
in various cell types, including in normal bovine mammary
epithelial BME-UV1 cells [28], mouse mesangial cells [29]
and hepatocellular carcinoma [30]. Moreover, TGF-β1induced autophagy is required for the fibrogenic response
in human atrial myofibroblasts [26]. However, whether
autophagy is involved in TGF-β1 induced effects on tumor
microenvironment are not well understood.
To address these issues, we utilized a vitro model
with NIH3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts challenged
with serum starvation (Star), to investigate TGF-β1
induced effects on starved NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Meanwhile,
we employed a mixed xenograft as a comparable in vivo
model to investigate TGF-β1 induced effects on tumor
microenvironment and solid tumor survival and growth.

Expression of TGF-β and CAFs maker α-SMA
were both increased in tumor tissues of breast
cancer patients
To investigate the relationship between TGF-β1
and CAFs in tumor microenvironment, we detected the
expression of TGF-β and CAFs maker α-SMA in normal
breast tissue and tumor tissues obtained from patients with
clinical stage I–IV breast cancer. Our results showed that a
minimum expression of TGF-β and α-SMA in the normal
breast tissue (n=10), while they were obviously increased
in tumor tissues (n=121), especially from the samples of
patients with clinical stage III/IV breast cancer (Figure 1).
The results revealed a positive association between TGF-β
expression and CAFs in tumor microenvironment of breast
cancer patients.

TGF-β1 exerted protective effects and induced
formation of CAFs phenotype in Star-treated
NIH3T3 fibroblasts
To simulate the nutritional deprivation of tumor
microenvironment, we utilized NIH3T3 mouse embryonic
fibroblasts challenged with Star as an in vitro model.
MTT assay showed that Star significantly inhibited
cell proliferation after serum-free incubation for 24
h or 48 h (P < 0.01). The growth inhibition induced by
Star was significantly attenuated by TGF-β1 (1.25-5
ng/ml), especially at 2.5 ng/ml (P < 0.01) (Figure 2A).
Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) has been
proposed as an ideal biomarker for environmental stress
[31]. Thus, we evaluated the level of MMP with TMRM
staining using confocal laser scanning microscopy.
Our results demonstrated that Star resulted in a loss of
MMP in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. TGF-β1 treatment (2.5 ng/
ml) relieved Star-induced loss of MMP. Using Hoechst
staining, we observed an increased DNA fragmentation (a
hallmark of apoptosis) in Star-treated NIH3T3 cells. The
decreased DNA fragmentation found in TGF-β1-treated
cells suggested a protective role of TGF-β1 (Figure 2B).
In addition, western blotting analysis showed that TGF-β1
induced CAFs features in Star-treated NIH3T3 fibroblasts,
which was characterized with positive expression of
α-SMA and FAP-α (Figure 2C). The CAFs features were
further confirmed by the results of immunofluorescent
microscopy (Figure 2D).

TGF-β1 enhanced autophagy in Star-treated
NIH3T3 fibroblasts
To test whether TGF-β1 induced autophagy in Startreated NIH3T3 fibroblasts, five different methods were
employed to evaluate the level of autophagy. Firstly,
MDC staining demonstrated that 24 h of serum-free
4123

incubation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts stimulated autophagy,
as evidenced by the increased MDC positive ratio.
Presence of TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) increased the ratio of
MDC staining in Star-stressed cells, while autophagy
inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 2 mM) blocked the

effects of TGF-β1 (Figure 3A). Next, we demonstrated
that treatment of cells with TGF-β1 significantly upregulated the expression level of autophagy genes,
including microtubule-associated protein LC3β
(MAPLC3β) and BECN1, in Star-treated NIH3T3

also increased by TGF-β1 treatment. Consistent with the
results of QPCR, the effects of TGF-β1 on Star-induced
BNIP3 and Beclin 1 expression were enhanced by Rapa,
while inhibited by 3-MA treatment (Figure 3C). The
results of confocal fluorescence microscopy also revealed
that TGF-β1 induced the accumulation of LC3β-II foci
and increased the level of co-localization of LC3β puncta
and mitochondria (MitoRed) in Star-treated NIH3T3
fibroblasts, suggesting the initiation of mitochondrial
autophagy. In contrast, autophagy inhibitor 3-MA
resulted in decrease of formation of LC3β-II foci (Figure
3D). Finally, the results of TEM demonstrated that
control cells exhibited a normal tubular mitochondrial
network (yellow arrows). In contrast, a deformation of
mitochondrion was packaged by autophagosome (red
arrows) in Star-treated cells. TGF-β1 increased the
autophagic vacuole containing injured mitochondria and
repaired the injured mitochondria in Star-treated NIH3T3
fibroblasts (Figure 3E).

To confirm the function of autophagy in TGF-β1induced protection and formation of CAFs phenotype in
Star-treated NIH3T3 fibroblasts, RNA interference was
utilized to knockdown ATG5, an important autophagy
factor (Figure 5A). Results showed that ATG5 knockdown
had almost completely inhibited Star- or Star+TGF-β1induced Beclin 1 expression and LC3β-II/I conversion
(Figure 5B). Data also revealed that TGF-β1 protected
NIH3T3 fibroblasts from Star-induced cell apoptosis and
necrosis. According to their reactivity towards annexin
V and PI, 93.73% of untreated NIH3T3 fibroblasts
were viable (Annexin-V−/PI−). In contrast, 24 h of Star
treatment increased the percentages of apoptotic cells, as
well as that of necrotic cells. Meanwhile, we found that
TGF-β1 protected NIH3T3 fibroblasts from Star-induced
significant numbers of apoptotic and necrotic cells.
However, ATG5 knockdown could block the effect of
TGF-β1 on apoptosis protection, resulting in the induction
of Annexin V+/PI- and Annexin V+/PI+ apoptotic cells
and Annexin-V−/PI+ necrotic cells in Star-treated NIH3T3
fibroblasts (Figure 5C). Interestingly, we also found that
TGF-β1-induced expression of α-SMA and FAP-α was
loss in ATG5 knockdown cells, further confirming the
involvement of autophagy in TGF-β1-induced formation
of CAFs phenotype in Star-treated NIH3T3 fibroblasts
(Figure 5D).

Autophagy was involved in TGF-β1-induced
protection and CAFs phenotype formation in
Star-treated NIH3T3 fibroblasts
To understand whether autophagy was implicated
in the beneficial effects of TGF-β1 in Star-treated
NIH3T3 fibroblasts, further experiments were
conducted. MTT assay showed that 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β1
significantly attenuated the growth inhibition in Startreated NIH3T3 fibroblasts (P< 0.01). Meanwhile,
this phenomenon was reinforced by Rapa (500 nM)
and suppressed by 3-MA (2 mM) (Figure 4A). Then,
we evaluated MMP with TMRM staining using flow
cytometry. Our results demonstrated that TGF-β1
relieved Star-induced MMP loss in Star-treated NIH3T3
fibroblasts, while the effects of TGF-β1 was suppressed
by 3-MA (Figure 4B). Moreover, a significant cleavage
of caspase-3 was detected in Star-treated cells, and the
protein expression of Bax was upregulated. TGF-β1
treatment could significantly protect NIH3T3 cells
from nutrition deprivation. The effect of TGF-β1
was enhanced by Rapa while abolished by 3-MA
treatment (Figure 4C). In addition, we investigated
whether autophagy was involved in TGF-β1 induced
CAFs features in Star-treated NIH3T3 fibroblast. A
co-localization of α-SMA and LC3β-II puncta was
detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our
results showed that the α-SMA and LC3β-II fluorescent
spots were less in Cont group. The accumulation of
LC3β-II foci were increased in cells treated with Star.
The co-localization of α-SMA and LC3β-II puncta
were promoted by TGF-β1 treatment, suggesting the
involvement of autophagy in TGF-β1 induced formation
of CAFs phenotype. In contrast, autophagy inhibitor
3-MA resulted in decrease of co-localization of α-SMA
and LC3β-II foci (Figure 4D).

TGF-β/Smad autophagy signaling pathway was
involved in TGF-β1-induced protection and
formation of CAFs phenotype in Star-treated
NIH3T3 fibroblasts
It has been reported that Smads were the canonical
effectors of TGF-β signaling, which could control
autophagy. However, whether Smads proteins have direct
transcriptional effects on autophagy remains less clear [30].
To address the issue, we examined the expression levels
of p-Smad2, Smad2, p-Smad3, Smad3 and autophagyrelative proteins by western blotting. Our results showed
that TGF-β1 up-regulated p-Smad2, p-Smad3, Beclin 1 and
LC3β-II/I conversion in Star-treated NIH3T3 fibroblast,
but TGF-βR1/ALK5 inhibitor LY-2157299 suppressed the
upregulation effects of TGF-β1 (Figure 6A). LY-2157299
further suppressed TGF-β1-induced up-regulation of
α-SMA and FAP-α protein expression in Star-treated
NIH3T3 fibroblast (Figure 6B). In addition, we evaluated
MMP with TMRM staining. Our results showed that LY2157299 abolished TGF-β1-induced protective effect on
mitochondria in Star-treated NIH3T3 fibroblast (Figure
6C). These data suggested that TGF-β1 induced protection
and formation of CAFs phenotype was through TGF-β/
Smad autophagy signaling pathway.

DISCUSSION

TGF-β1-induced autophagy could also activate
the formation of CAFs phenotype in tumor
microenvironment of mixed xenograft tumor

In tumor microenvironment, CAFs usually mediate
tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. It can arise
from tumor stroma where TGF-β is thought to promote
the differentiation of fibroblasts to CAFs [32]. In turn,
CAFs secrete large amounts of TGF-β, which induces an
autocrine signaling loop and maintains the differentiation
of fibroblasts into CAFs [33]. In our study, our results
revealed a positive association between TGF-β expression
and CAFs phenotype in tumor microenvironment of breast
cancer patients. To further investigate the relationship
between TGF-β expression and formation of CAFs in
tumor microenvironment, we employed starved NIH3T3
fibroblasts in vitro and 4T1 cells mixed with NIH3T3
fibroblasts xenograft tumor model in vivo to simulate
nutritional deprivation of tumor microenvironment.
It has been reported that nutrient deprivation or
energy restriction decrease tumor growth by reducing
ageing-associated inflammation, elevating glucocorticoid
hormone, and decreasing angiogenesis [34]. Moreover,
Sanchez et al. reported that stromal cells in the nutrientdeprived core utilized autophagy to support the
surrounding cells [35]. In our study, we had confirmed that
Star led to proliferation inhibition, loss of MMP and cell
apoptosis, which were attenuated by TGF-β1 treatment. It
is worth noting that TGF-β1 also induced an upregulation
of CAFs markers, α-SMA and FAP-α, in Star-treated
NIH3T3 fibroblasts. These data suggested that TGF-β1
could protect NIH3T3 cells from nutrient deprivation and
induce the formation of CAFs, which were consistent with
a previous research on TGF-β1-induced transformation of
NIH3T3 fibroblasts to myofibroblasts [5].
Recently, a growing amount of evidence argues for
the function of autophagy in tumor microenvironment
[36–38]. The activation of autophagy may be a viable
therapeutic option for cancer cells located in the core of
solid tumors with a nutrient-deficient microenvironment
[39]. Moreover, cells survivals depend on autophagy
during nutrient deprivation [40]. It has reported that
TGF-β1 can induce autophagy to support cell survival
in mouse mesangial cells [29] and reduce apoptosis
in hepatic stellate cells [41]. In agreement with the
previous findings, MDC results showed that Starinduced autophagy was enhanced by TGF-β1 in NIH3T3
fibroblasts, which was found to be prevented by autophagy
inhibitors such as wortmannin or 3-MA [42]. Meanwhile,
the expression of autophagy related genes and proteins
BNIP3, Beclin 1 and conversion of LC3 I to II, indicated
that TGF-β1 enhanced Star-induced autophagy. Our
TEM and confocal fluorescence imaging data also
clearly indicated that TGF-β1 promoted the mitophagy.
All of the above confirmed that Star-induced autophagy
might be a stress-evoked compensatory mechanism,
which was insufficient to fight against Star-induced
cellular damages during nutrient deprivation. However,

It is well known that myofibroblasts or CAFs is
essential components in the tumor microenvironment. Our
previous research has demonstrated that mixed xenograft
tumor model with the ratio of 1:2 (4T1 breast cancer cells:
NIH3T3 fibroblast cells) is beneficial to tumor growth
(Supplement 1). In order to investigate whether TGF-β1
could induce CAFs features in tumor microenvironment,
we used the mixed xenografted Balb/c mice as an in vivo
model. Our results showed that treatment of TGF-β1 to
starved NIH3T3 cells in the mixed xenograft tumor could
increase the expression of both CAFs markers, while
3-MA treatment reduced the effects of TGF-β1 (Figure 7A
and 7B). These results indicated that TGF-β1 promoted
in vivo CAFs transformation.
In order to confirm that autophagy was involved
in TGF-β1 induced CAFs transformation in tumor
microenvironment, we further evaluated the expression of
autophagy related protein by western blotting. It was found
that the occurrence of autophagy was significantly higher
in NIH3T3 fibroblasts with Star treatment in the mixed
xenograft tumor. TGF-β1 pro-treatment in Star-treated
NIH3T3 fibroblasts significantly enhanced the expression
of BNIP3, Beclin 1 and LC3β-II/I conversion in the mixed
xenograft tumor, while 3-MA suppressed the effects of
TGF-β1 (Figure 7C). Moreover, the co-localization of α-SMA
and LC3β-II puncta was promoted by TGF-β1 treatment in
the mixed xenograft tumor. In contrast, autophagy inhibitor
3-MA resulted in decreased formation of α-SMA and LC3βII foci induced by TGF-β1 treatment (Figure 7D).

TGF-β1-induced autophagy promoted tumor
growth of mixed xenograft tumor in Balb/c mice
Our findings have indicated that TGF-β1-induced
autophagy triggered formation of CAFs phenotype in
tumor microenvironment. To evaluate these effects of
TGF-β1 on tumor development in vivo, we detected
tumor volume and weight in Balb/c mice challenged with
mixed xenograft tumor. Our results showed that treatment
of NIH3T3 cells with Star suppressed tumor growth in
mice, while TGF-β1 pro-treatment in Star-treated NIH3T3
fibroblasts could promote tumor growth. However, the
beneficial effects of TGF-β1 were antagonized by 3 days
or 7 days of 3-MA (15 mg/kg) administration (Figure 8A
and 8B). Furthermore, significant necrosis was found in
Star group, while TGF-β1 and Rapa (1 mg/kg) obviously
restored the Star-related necrosis, the effect of TGF-β1
was suppressed by 3-MA (Figure 8C). Moreover, TUNEL
results showed that apoptotic ratio was significantly higher
in Star group. TGF-β1 and Rapa treatment reduced Starinduced apoptosis, while 3-MA could abolish the effect of
TGF-β1 treatment (Figure 8D).

TGF-β1 enhanced Star-induced autophagy and caused

NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, ATG5

treated NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Meanwhile, our results in vivo
also confirmed that TGF-β1 could induce the formation
of CAFs phenotype formation by autophagy in tumor
microenvironment of mixed xenograft tumor.
It has been reported that autophagy limits tumor
formation in the early stage, while favors tumor cell
survival and invasion as soon as cancer is formed [43].
Meanwhile, high stromal autophagy can promote cancer
progression [44]. Therefore, TGF-β1-induced autophagy
in breast cancer might be implicated in tumor promotion
[45]. Our results demonstrated that TGF-β1 treatment
effectively prevented Star-induced suppression on tumor
growth, while 3-MA prevented the beneficial effects of
TGF-β1. Furthermore, TGF-β1 could restore Star-induced
necrosis and apoptosis in tumor microenvironment.
Taken together, these data demonstrated that TGF-β1induced autophagy contributed to the formation of CAFs
phenotype, and then promoted tumor growth.
In conclusion, we found that TGF-β1 promoted
the survival of starved NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and
activated the formation of CAFs phenotype in the
tumor microenvironment, which could promote tumor
growth. It is noteworthy that autophagy inhibitor
3-MA, Atg5 siRNA or LY-2157299 blocked TGFβ1-induced protective effects and the formation of
CAFs phenotypes, suggesting that TGF-β1-induced
these effects through TGF-β/Smad autophagy
signaling pathway. Moreover, it has been reported
that CAFs create a nutrient-rich microenvironment,
to metabolically support tumor growth, via the local
stromal generation of mitochondrial fuels (lactate,
ketone bodies, fatty acids, glutamine, and other amino
acids) [46] (Schema 1). The autophagy mechanisms
of TGF-β1, thus, make it a unique, potential and more
useful to induce formation of CAFs phenotype to
promote tumor growth. Therefore, TGF-β1-induced
autophagy is a significant determinant in tumor growth
and progression for breast cancer therapies.

day for seven days. Tumor volume (cm3) was calculated
according to the formula: (π/6) × tumor length × tumor
width2. At the end of the experiment (day 22 after tumor
implantation), the animals were sacrificed. Tumors were
excised before determinations of biochemical parameters.

slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and observed
under a light microscope.

TUNEL assay
TUNEL assay for fluorescence microscopy was
conducted following the instruction of the detection
kit. Tumor samples acquired were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded with paraffin.
Paraffin blocks of tumor were cut into 4 μm slices and
then processed using standard deparaffinization and
rehydration techniques. Slices were incubated in PBS
containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Afterwards,
slices were washed twice with PBS and stained with
TUNEL detection fluid for 1 h, and then washed three
times with PBS. FITC-labeled TUNEL-positive cells
were imaged by Leica-CTR MIC fluorescent microscope
(Leica Camera AG, Solms, Germany) under 488nm excitation and 530-nm emission. Microscopic
photographs were merged by Adobe Photoshop CS3
Extended software (version: 10.0.1; Adobe, San Jose’,
CA, USA).

Q-PCR (Quantitative real-time PCR) assay

MTT assay

Total mRNA of the cells was extracted after
treatment of the indicated time. First strand cDNA
synthesis was generated from 500 ng of total RNA.
Quantification of target and reference (β-actin) genes
was performed in triplicate on LightCycler® 480
II (Roche, Applied Science). The primers used in
each reaction were as follows: BECN1 forward 5′
TTACCACAGCCCAGGCGAAA 3′ and reverse 5′
TCCCCGATCAGAGTGAAGCTATTAG 3′; LC3β
forward 5′ TGTAGGATATAGCTCTAAGCCGGGT 3′
and reverse 5′ TCAGCAGAAGGGCGTATGGTAAC 3′;
β-actin forward 5′ TGAGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC
3′ and reverse 5′ GCTCGTTGCCAATAGTGATGACC
3′. After normalized to β-actin gene, expression levels for
each target gene were calculated using the comparative
threshold cycle (CT) method. The Δct values were
calculated according to the formula Δct =ct (gene of
interest)-ct (β-actin) in correlation analysis, and the
2-ΔΔct was calculated according to the formula ΔΔct
= Δct (control group) -Δct (experimental group) for
determination of relative. Data are presented as the
mean standard deviation (SD) from three independent
experiments.

The growth inhibitory effect of reagents on cells
was measured by MTT assay. Cells were dispensed in
96-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well. After
24h incubation, cells were treated with the tested agents
for the indicated periods of time. A 20 µl aliquot of 0.5%
MTT solution was added to each well followed by 4h
incubation. Optical density was measured using an ELISA
reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Franklin, MA, USA).
Statistical significance of the experimental data from three
independent experiments was determined by the Student’s
t-test, and P values < 0.05 were considered significant.

Histological examination
For histological evaluation, all tumor samples were
fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and 4 μm thick
sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E).These specimens were observed under a light
microscope.

Immunohistochemical staining
Tumor sections (4 μm) were dewaxed and rehydrated
regularly and then treated with 3% H2O2. The sections
were then pretreated with a microwave antigen retrieval
technique. Then the non-specific sites were blocked with
10% goat serum for 30min at room temperature. The
specimens were then incubated overnight at 4°C with the
following antibodies: anti-α-SMA (1: 500), anti-FAP-α
(1:500) and anti-TGF-β (1:500). On the second day, after
incubation with secondary antibody, an antibody binding
analysis was performed using a DAB kit. Finally, the

TMRM assay for mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP) using flow cytometer

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for
observation of autophagic ultrastructure

MMP (Δψm) was measured with flow cytometry
using TMRM staining. TMRM accumulates in normal
mitochondria due to its positive charge whereby the reduction
of MMP leads to the release of TMRM. Following various
treatments, cells were incubated with 100 nM TMRM at 37°C
for 30 min. Harvested cells were immediately analyzed for
potential using Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer
(650 nm long pass filter) equipped with Expo32 ADC.

Following various treatments, NIH3T3 cells were
fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.3) for
2 h at 4 °C and washed extensively with 0.1 M cacodylate
buffer including 0.1 % CaCl2. The samples were fixed
in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer including 0.1 % CaCl2 for
at least 30 min and then dehydrated with ethanol series
and polymerized at 60 °C for 2 days. After being cut by
ultracut microtome, the sections were stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate and analyzed with a Philips Tecnai
10 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR,
USA).

Assessment of MMP and apoptosis using
fluorescent microscopy
Following various treatments, cells were stained
with 20 µM Hoechst 33258 and 100 nM TMRM at 37°C
for 30 min. The images were recorded on a Leica CTR
MIC fluorescent microscope (Leica Camera AG, Solms,
Germany).

ATG5 knockdown using siRNA procedure
Small interfering siRNA targeting ATG5 or nontargeting negative control were purchased from Ribobio
(Guangzhou, China). NIH3T3 cells at 50% confluency
were transfected for 48 h with siRNA of ATG5 or
control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfection
efficiency was optimized by trying a range of siRNA and
Lipofectamine 2000 concentrations.

MDC assay for autophagic vacuole
To confirm the occurrence of autophagy, MDC was
used as it can selectively incorporate into autophagosomes
and autolysosomes. Following various treatments,
cells were incubated with 10 µM MDC at 37°C for 1 h,
intracellular MDC fluorescence (530/30 nm bandpass
filter) was determined using Leica CTR MIC fluorescent
microscope (Leica Camera AG, Solms, Germany) within
30 min after incubation.

Annexin V/PI staining analysis
Following various treatments, cells were washed
with PBS, stained for AnnexinV–FITC and propidium
iodide according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and
analyzed using Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer
(650 nm long pass filter) equipped with Expo32 ADC.

Assessment of autophagy

Patients and specimen selection

Following various treatments, NIH3T3 cells were
stained with MitoRed at 37°C for 30 min, and then fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde. Samples were labeled with antiLC3β at 4°C overnight and incubated with secondary
antibody-Alexa flour 488® at 37°C for 4 h. Samples were
counterstained with DAPI before being imaged using a
Leica CTR MIC fluorescence microscope or Zeiss LSM510
Meta DuoScan laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl
Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) as indicated.

The paraffin-embedded postoperative tissue specimens
were obtained from the archives of the Department of
Pathology, the Third People’s Hospital of Huizhou, between
January of 2006 and June of 2012. We retrospectively
retrieved 121 tumor specimens of patients with clinical
stage I-IV breast cancer. In addition, the paraffin-embedded
normal breast tissue specimens (n=10) were obtained from
the archives of the Sichuan Provincial Cancer Hospital.
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics
Committee of the Third People’s Hospital of Huizhou,
Sichuan Provincial Cancer Hospital and Jinan University. All
participants were acknowledged by providing their written
informed consent to participate in this study. Our ethics
committees approved this consent procedure.
