ABSTRACT
Retinoid X receptor (RXR) and Histone deacetylase (HDAC) are considered
important targets for cancer therapy due to their crucial roles in genetic or epigenetic
regulations of cancer development and progression. Here, we evaluated the potential
of dual targeting of RXR and HDAC using DW22 as a novel therapeutic approach
to cancer treatment. We found that the co-expression of RXR-α and HDAC1 was
frequently appeared in lung cancer and breast cancer tissues and cell lines. RXR was
activated by DW22 in RXRα and HDAC1 overexpressed A549 and MDA-MB-435 cell
lines. Meanwhile, DW22 inhibited the activity of HDAC by decreasing its expression
in A549 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines, but not in RXRα and HDAC1 deficient cell lines.
Moreover, DW22 suppressed cell growth, induced cell differentiation, prompted cell
apoptosis and arrested cell cycle in A549, MDA-MB-435 or HL60 cell lines. Treatment
human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) with DW22 suppressed migration,
invasion and tube formation through decreasing VEGF expression. The up-regulation
of Ac-H3 and p21, and down-regulation of VEGF caused by DW22 was markedly
attenuated by silencing of HDAC1. Furthermore, knockdown of RXRα by siRNA
completely blocked DW22-induced cell differentiation, but partially attenuated DW22caused inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell apoptosis, and suppression of
cell migration, invasion and tube formation. Moreover, intravenous administration
of DW22 significantly retarded tumor growth of A549 and MDA-MB-435 xenograft
mice models, and induced no substantial weight loss and gross toxicity. In addition,
DW22 also reduced cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and induced cell apoptosis in vivo.
Collectively, our data demonstrates that dual targeting of RXR and HDAC using DW22
possesses pleiotropic antitumor activities both in vitro and in vivo, providing a novel
therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.

enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis,
and activating invasion and metastasis [1–3]. Therefore,
the multi-target therapeutic approach to comprehensively
inhibit the biological capabilities of tumors is considered
as the ideal therapy strategy [4, 5].

Retinoid X receptor (RXR), a well-known molecular
target in several human tumors [6], executes its biological
functions with retinoid acid receptor (RAR) to modulate
the transcriptional activity of retinoid receptor target
genes associated with cell growth and differentiation
[6]. Bexarotene, a small molecule RXR agonist, was
successfully tested in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
(CTCL) and had been approved by FDA [7], indicating
the potential of RXR as an anti-cancer target. Recently,
several clinical trials were ongoing to assess the potential
of Bexarotene for treatment of other cancers, such as lung
cancer [8, 9] and breast cancer [10], but failed to show
clinical benefit. These data suggest that targeting a single
RXR in these cancers may not be efficient enough for
successful treatment of these deadly diseases.
The mammalian target of histone deacetylase
(HDAC) was intensively studied in a multitude of human
tumor entities over the past couple of years [11]. HDAC,
that deacetylates lysines on core histones and other cellular
proteins, plays the crucial roles in the epigenetic regulation
of gene transcription and controlling cellular functions,
such as cell-cycle, terminal differentiation, apoptosis,
migration, invasion and angiogenesis [12]. Two HDAC
inhibitors, SAHA (vorinostat) and FK228 (romidepsin),
have been approved by FDA for the treatment of CTCL
[13], indicating that HDAC is an important target for
tumor therapy.
Recent research has shown that the combination of
RXR agonist and HDAC inhibitor synergistically blocked
the growth of tumors in preclinical and clinical studies
[14, 15], which represents a possible molecular link between
the RXR and the HDAC. In fact, a previous study also
demonstrated there was an inter-regulation between RXR
and HDAC. Li Y et al demonstrated that RXR agonist
Bexarotene causes the recruitment of HDAC to the target
gene’s promoter and then resulting in transcriptional
repression [16], suggested that there might be an opposite
relationship between RXR activation and HDAC inhibition.
Taken together, we hypothesis it might be an ideal anti-tumor
approach by activating RXR simultaneously inhibiting
HDAC. In our previous study, we identified a compound,
DW22, which could activate RXR and inhibit HDAC
in cancer cells, and also demonstrated the efficacy as an
antitumor agent in representative cancer cell lines and drugresistant cancer cell lines [17]. Here, we further demonstrate
that dual targeting RXR and HDAC using DW22 possesses
pleiotropic antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo, providing
a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.

to analyze RXR and HDAC expression in human tumors.
Using immunohistochemistry method, we detected RXR-α
and HDAC1, which are mainly functional subtype of
RXR and HDAC respectively, in human lung and breast
tissues. As shown in Figure 1A and 1B, RXR-α was
expressed, especially in the cytoplasm, at a higher level
in lung cancer when compared with that in adjacent noncancerous (normal) tissues (Figure 1A and 1B). HDAC1
showed a similar pattern to RXR-α (Figure 1A and 1B).
Interestingly, we detected that 52% lung cancers expressed
both proteins in high level (Figure 1C). Consistent with
previous report [18], the level of RXR-α was lower in
normal breast tissues. However, RXR-α was markedly
enhanced in breast cancer tissues (Figure 1A and 1B). In
contrast to lung tissue, there was no significant difference
of HDAC1 expression between breast tumor tissues and
normal tissues (Figure 1A and 1B). Importantly, a relative
higher co-expressed rate of RXR-α and HDAC1 (54%)
was also found in breast cancer tissues (Figure 1C).
Furthermore, co-expression of RXR-α and HDAC1
correlated with poor prognosis than either single- or
double-negative RXR-α and HDAC1 groups in lung
cancer, but not in breast cancer (Figure 1D). In accord with
results of tumor tissues, most of RXR-α overexpressed
cell lines also expressed HDAC1 at a relative high level in
both lung cancer and breast cancer cell lines (Figure 1E).
Taken together, these results strongly support the
feasibility of proposed RXR/HDAC targeted therapy for
human tumors.

DW22 activates RXR and inhibits HDAC
in human cancer cell lines
DW22 was identified as a compound dual-targeting
of RXR and HDAC [17] (See Figure 2A). Here, we
examined the effect of DW22 on RXR activation using
cell-based transactivation assays in RXR-α overexpressed
cell lines A549 and MDA-MB-435. It was showed that
treatment of A549 or MDA-MB-435 cells with DW22
significantly activated RXR reporter in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 2B). As a positive control,
Bexarotene (1 μM) treatment also resulted in an activation
of RXR. To explore the activation mechanism, we detected
the expression level of RXRα after treatment with DW22
in both cell lines. Western blot analysis data showed that
either DW22 or Bexarotene had no effect on the expression
of RXRα (Data not shown). These results demonstrate that
DW22 can activate RXRα irrespective of its expression in
A549 or MDA-MB-435 cells. The observations described
above raise the possibility that DW22 might be an agonist
of RXR. To test this hypothesis we examined the effect
of DW22 on RXRα coactivator interaction in vitro by
TR-FRET. In this assay, the interaction of the RXRα
(indirectly labeled by terbium) with the coactivator peptide
PGC1α (labeled with fluorescein) was detected. As shown
in Figure 2C, DW22 treatment resulted in an enhanced

agonist, Bexarotene (EC50 = 16.2 nmol/L). These results
suggest that DW22 is a ligand and an agonist of RXRα.
We subsequently tested the HDAC inhibition
activity of DW22 in both HDAC1 overexpressed cell
lines (A549 and MDA-MB-435) and paired HDAC1
deficient cell lines (NCI-H460 and MDA-MB-436). Our
data indicated that DW22 exhibited markedly HDAC

inhibitory activity among all measured concentrations
in A549 and MDA-MB-435 cells, but not in NCI-H460
and MDA-MB-436 cells (Figure 2D). In order to verify
the HDAC inhibition of DW22, the effects of DW22
on the level of acetylated histones were examined by
western blot analysis using the specific antibodies against
acetylated H3 and H4. As a result, DW22 significantly
increased the levels of acetylated H3 and H4 (Figure 2E)
in a concentration-dependent manner in A549 and

MDA-MB-435 cells. However, DW22-caused increase
of acetylated H3 and H4 were significant attenuated in
NCI-H460 and MDA-MB-436 cells when compared to
those in A549 and MDA-MB-435 cells (Supplementary
Figure 1). The crucial role of HDAC inhibition in
acetylation of histones was confirmed by silencing
HDAC1 in A549 cells. The increase of acetylated H3
induced by DW22 was blocked by specific HDAC1 siRNA
(Supplementary Figure 2). In addition, we also detected
the effects of DW22 and SAHA on the expression level
of HDAC1. The data indicated that, similar to SAHA,
DW22 decreased the expression of HDAC1 in A549 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MDA-MB-435 cell lines (Figure 2E). Taken together,
these results suggest that DW22 could inhibit HDAC
activity through downregulating its expression.

DW22 inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell
differentiation in human cancer cells
To verify the importance of RXR and HDAC, we
next investigated the anti-proliferative effect of DW22
on both overexpressed targets cell lines and deficient
targets cell lines using MTT method. As shown in Table 1,
DW22 treatment exhibited an anti-proliferative effects

on overexpressed targets cell lines (A549 and MDAMB-435) with a mean IC50 of 6.8 μM, which is obviously
lower than that of deficient targets cell lines (NCI-H460
and MDA-MB-436, mean IC50 > 54.1 μM). Similar
tendency was also observed in SAHA or Bexarotene
treated cells. We further tested the ability of DW22 to
inhibit cell proliferation in A549 and MDA-MB-435
cell lines using clonogenicity assay. The results revealed
that DW22 inhibited cell proliferation of both cell lines
in concentration-dependent manner, and the inhibitory
activity of DW22 was comparable with SAHA and far
more potently than Bexarotene (Figure 3A).
To determine the effects of DW22 on cell
differentiation, HL-60 cells were treated with different
concentrations of the compounds, and the extent of
myeloid cell differentiation was assessed by the NBT
reduction assay. As shown in Figure 3B, the addition of
DW22 to cultures resulted in a marked concentrationdependent increase in the degree of differentiation.
Confirmed the RXR activation data, in the same
concentration (20 μM), DW22 displayed an enhanced
ability to induce differentiation as compared with
Bexarotene.

The induction of p21 by DW22 was well confirmed
by cell arrest data in A549 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines.
Cell cycle analysis results indicated that DW22, at the
concentrations of 1 and 5 μM, induced a significant
arrest in the G2-M phase (Figure 3F). Interestingly, we
found that DW22, at a relative higher concentration
(20 μM), could not induce an obvious arrest, but lead
to a proportional increase in SubG1 phase (data not
shown) which is considered as apoptosis. Therefore, we
next examined the effects of DW22 on cell apoptosis
using AnnxinV/PI double staining methods. The data
revealed that DW22 (20 μM) caused an increase in
the percentage of apoptosis cells (Annexin V(+)/PI(–))
in A549 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines (Figure 3G).
Compared with that of Bexarotene, DW22 exhibits an
enhanced apoptosis-induced potential (Figure 3G). The
above data was further confirmed by measuring the
cleavages of PARP and Caspase-3 which are regarded as
biomarkers of cell apoptosis. DW22 treatment at higher
concentration (20 μM) resulted in an obvious increasing
of the cleavages of PARP and Caspase-3 as compared
to control, but there were no effects of DW22 at low
concentrations (1 and 5 μM, Figure 3H). The targets
related action of DW22 was confirmed using deficient
targets cell lines (NCI-H460 and MDA-MB-436). The
addition of DW22 could not lead to a marked cleavage
of Caspase-3 in NCI-H460 and MDA-MB-436 cells
(Supplementary Figure 4).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the
anti-proliferative action of DW22 to human cancer cells is
accomplished through arrest of cell-cycle progression and
induction of apoptosis.

DW22 induces up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1,
arrests cell cycle and causes apoptosis
in human cancer cells
It has been demonstrated that the induction of
p21WAF1/CIP1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is the
result of HDAC inhibitor-mediated histones acetylation
[19]. Therefore, we further measured the levels of p21
WAF1/CIP1
to verify the effect of DW22 on the HDAC. The
results showed that DW22 could increase the expression of
p21WAF1/CIP1 in a concentration-dependent manner in A549
and MDA-MB-435 cell lines (Figure 3C). In addition,
p21 mRNA was also upregulated by DW22 in A549 cells
(Figure 3D). To correlate p21 up-regulation and localized
chromatin organization, the binding of acetylated histone
H3 was analyzed at the p21 promoter using ChIP assay. As
shown in Figure 3E, two reported regions (−742 to −488
and −2894 to −1753) showed a 3–6 folds enrichment of
the acetylated histones H3 in DW22 treated A549 cells
[20]. The role of HDAC inhibition in p21 induction was
confirmed by silencing HDAC1 in A549 cells. The DW22induced increase of p21 was reversed by specific HDAC1
siRNA (Supplementary Figure 3).

DW22 inhibits migration, invasion, and tube
formation of endothelial cells through downregulation of VEGF
The migration, invasion and angiogenesis of
endothelial cell are necessary for tumor growth and
metastasis [21]. Thus, we assessed the effects of
DW22 on VEGF-induced migration, invasion, and tube
formation of HUVECs in vitro. In order to exclude the
cytotoxicity of DW22, the viability of HUVECs after
treatment with DW22 was firstly examined. DW22
treatment for 12 h caused a slight decrease in the
percentage of metabolically viable HUVECs at 20 μM
(Supplementary Figure 5). In addition, treatment with

DW22 for 36 h only resulted in a 15% inhibition of
cell viability (Data not shown). Therefore, the maximal
concentration of 20 μM was chosen in the following
experiments. The effects of DW22 on the chemotactic
motility of HUVECs were measured by wound-healing
migration assay, RTCA and Transwell cell invasion assay.
It was showed that DW22 dramatically reduced VEGFinduced HUVECs invasion and migration (Figure 4A,
4B, and 4C). Both effects of DW22 were concentration
dependent, with significant inhibition first occurring
at 1  μM. In the same concentration (5 μM), DW22
displayed a relatively weak ability to inhibit migration of
HUVECs as compared with SAHA.
Although angiogenesis is a very complex process,
tube formation of endothelial cells is one of the key steps
[22]. Next, we investigated how DW22 affects HUVEC
tube formation using two-dimensioned Matrigel assay. As
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

shown in Figure 4D, in the presence of VEGF, elongated
and robust tube-like structures were formed. When treated
with DW22, the formation of tubular structures was
significantly blocked. Meanwhile, the results also revealed
that the protein expressions of VEGF were downregulated
by DW22 treatment (Figure 4E) in HUVECs, A549
and MDA-MB-435 cells, which suggested the impaired
migration, invasion and tube formation ability might be
present in DW22-treated solid tumor microenvironment
through inhibiting VEGF expression.
To further explore the underlying mechanism of
DW22-caused decrease of VEGF, we accessed the role
of HDAC1 in this event. Silencing of HDAC1 by siRNA
could markedly block the effects of DW22-caused VEGF
decrease in A549 cells (Supplementary Figure 6). Previous
study reported that HDAC1 down-regulation could result
in an increase of KLF4 [23], which is considered as a
9746

Oncotarget

repressor of VEGF [25]. Therefore, we hypothesis whether
KLF4 is a directly regulator of VEGF down-regulation
caused by DW22. Our data indicated that DW22 could
increase the expression of KLF-4 in a concentrationdependent manner in HUVECs and A549 cells
(Supplementary Figure 7). These results demonstrated that
DW22 treatment resulted in HDAC inhibition, then led
to up-regulation of KLF4, finally contributed to the
down-regulation of VEGF.

MDA-MB-435 xenograft models, which are demonstrated
to be responsive to DW22 by the above in vitro experiments.
Docetaxel, a first line anti-cancer drug for lung cancer and
breast cancer, was used as control and for comparable.
As shown in Figure 6A, DW22 could significantly
inhibit tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner with
the maximal inhibition rate 53% which is comparable to
docetaxel (57%) in A549 xenografts. Similar data was
obtained from MDA-MB-435 xenografts. Additionally,
DW22 did not cause reduced body weight of the host
mice (Figure 6B) or other side effects such as hair loss,
mortality, and lethargy. In contrast to DW22, docetaxel
treatment resulted in an obviously decrease of body
weight in both xenograft models (23.1% decrease in
A549 xenografts and 22.3% decrease in MDA-MB-435
xenografts).
To confirm the action mechanisms of DW22,
we next examined Ki67 staining index for cellular
proliferation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) index for
apoptosis, and CD31 staining for newly formed blood
vessels using MDA-MB-435 xenograft tumor tissues.
Treatment by DW22 caused significant decrease of Ki-67
index and microvessel density, and obviously prompted
apoptosis in vivo (Figure 6C). These data confirmed that
the in vivo inhibitory effects of DW22 on tumor growth
were mediated by inhibition of cell proliferation and
angiogenesis, and induction of apoptosis.

RXR silence attenuates DW22-mediated
suppression of cell proliferation, migration,
invasion, tube formation, and –induced cell
differentiation and apoptosis
To explore the role of the activation of RXR in
DW22-mediated alterations of biological characteristics
in human cancer or endothelial cells, we determined the
effects of RXRα silence by specific siRNA on DW22mediated suppression of cell proliferation, migration,
invasion, tube formation, and –induced cell differentiation
and apoptosis. Cells transfected with the scramble siRNA
were used as controls. The level of RXRα was reduced
over 70% in transfected with RXRα siRNA compared with
the scramble siRNA transfected control cells (data not
shown). As expected, the DW22 and Bexarotene–mediated
viability inhibitions of both cell lines were attenuated by
silence of RXRα, whereas there was no effect of RXRα
silence on proliferation inhibitory ability of SAHA
(Figure 5A). In addition, similar to untransfected HUVEC
cells, the DW22 treatment inhibited migration, invasion,
and tube formation in scramble siRNA–transfected control
HUVEC cells (Figure 5B, and 5D). The DW22–mediated
inhibition of HUVECs migration, invasion and tube
formation was partly weakened by silence of RXRα. These
results confirmed that the DW22–mediated inhibition of
cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation
was partly dependent on RXRα activation.
Next, we assessed the effect of RXRα silence on
DW22–induced cell differentiation and apoptosis. As
shown in Figure 5E, DW22–induced differentiation of
HL60 cells was almost completely blocked by silence of
RXRα, suggesting RXR activation dominantly contributes
to DW22-induced cell differentiation. Furthermore, FACS
data showed that the DW22–induced apoptosis of A549
and MDA-MB-435 cells was partly attenuated by silence
of RXRα (see Figure 5F), indicating RXRα activation also
is involved into the DW22–induced apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
RXR and HDAC are considered as important
anti-tumor targets, respectively [6, 11]. However,
whether combining the two targets could become a
novel anti-tumor approach is still not known. In theory,
hyperacetylation of histone proteins induced by HDAC
inhibitors could increase the accessibility of DNA within
chromatin, loosen gene promoter and consequently
potentiate the anticancer activities of RXR agonist.
Therefore, it is possible dual targeting of RXR and HDAC
would exhibit an enhanced antitumor efficiency. In present
study, we demonstrate that DW22 effectively targeted
RXR/HDAC simultaneously and inhibited tumor cells in
multiple aspects. In xenograft tumor models, intravenous
administration of DW22 decreased Ki67 and CD31 in
tumor tissue, induced apoptosis, and significantly inhibited
tumor growth compared to control animals.
DW22 was identified as a dual targeting compound
in our previous report [17]. However, the detail
mechanism of action of DW22 on RXR and HDAC is not
clear. As for activating of RXR, we observed that, similar
to Bexarotene, DW22 have no effect on the expression
of RXR, but result in an enhanced binding of the RXRα

elevating RXR binding ability might be the underlying
mechanism of DW22 for activating RXR. Our results

showed that DW22 could decrease the expression of
HDAC1, demonstrating that the downregulation of HDAC
might be potential mechanism of DW22 for inhibiting
HDAC activity. This molecular mechanism is consistent to
SAHA [25], but not to FK228 [26]. Taken together, based
on this data, we illustrated that DW22 was a novel dual
targeting compound shared the common properties with
Bexarotene and SAHA.
RXR is demonstrated to be associated with cell
growth, apoptosis and differentiation by modulating the
transcriptional activity of retinoid receptor target genes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[6]. Our results indicated that DW22 could inhibit cell
growth and induce cell apoptosis and differentiation,
indicating that DW22 maintains RXR-related biological
functions. HDAC has been documented to regulating the
expression of genes linked to the inhibition of cell growth,
induction of cell differentiation, promotion of apoptosis
and suppression of invasion and angiogenesis [12]. Here,
the obtained data showed that DW22 blocked cell cycle
by downregulating of p21, and inhibited cell invasion and
angiogenesis through decreasing expression of VEGF,
which verified the nature of DW22 as a HDAC inhibitor.

In conclusion, the pleiotropic antitumor activities of
DW22 demonstrate dual targeting of RXR and HDAC is a
feasible antitumor approach.
Although there exist high differences in biological
characteristics between RXR and HDAC, they possess
several overlapped biological activities, such as
regulation of cell growth and differentiation [6, 12]. Our
results revealed that DW22-caused cell growth arrest
and apoptosis was partly attenuated, suggesting RXR

activation and HDAC inhibition collectively contribute
to these events. In addition, the data showed that DW22induced cell differentiation was completely inhibited
by RXR known-down, indicating RXR activation,
but not HDAC inhibition, mediates DW22-induced
cell differentiation. Interestingly, we also found that
DW22-caused inhibition of cell migration, invasion and
angiogenesis were partly weakened by RXR knockdown, demonstrating RXR activation also is involved into

MATERIALS AND METHODS

DW22-mediated inhibitions of cell migration, invasion
and angiogenesis. In fact, the RXR agonists, such as
Bexarotene, have been reported to inhibit angiogenesis
and metastasis [27]. Thus, it is possible that DW22, as a
novel RXR agonist, suppress cell migration, invasion and
angiogenesis by activating RXR partially.
The significant finding of this study is the coexpression of RXR and HDAC in human lung and breast
cancer tissues and cell lines. In addition, it was unexpected
that RXR-α was accumulated in the cytoplasm in the most
of tumor tissues, suggesting the inactivated RXR is widely
presented in the breast and lung cancer. The fact that both
RXR and HDAC are extensively expressed in the breast
and lung cancer enhances the possibility of success of the
proposed tumor therapeutic approach by simultaneous
targeting of RXR and HDAC.
In summary, this study firstly demonstrates
that dual targeting of RXR and HDAC using DW22
possesses pleiotropic antitumor activities in vitro and
in vivo (Figure 7), providing a sound scientific base for
developing this novel approach for treatment cancer.

Tumor tissue from patients and
immunohistochemistry
Tissues from patients with breast cancer or lung
cancer were retrospectively identified from the surgical
pathology files of Wuhan General Hospital of Guangzhou
Command (Wuhan, PR, China). Pathology slides were
analyzed according to tumor size, histologic type, and
presence of nodal metastasis. Ethical oversight and
approval was obtained from the Institutional Review
Board of Wuhan General Hospital of Guangzhou
Command. The clinicopathologic features of these
patients have been summarized in Supplementary Table
1 and 2. A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed (in
collaboration with the Shanghai Biochip Company Ltd.)
as described previously [28]. Following antigen retrieval
and blocking, TMA sections (4 mm) were immunostained
using antibodies against RXR-α (1:100 dilution; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and HDAC1 (1:200 dilution; Abcam)

Figure 7: Schematic form of the proposed mechanisms of the effect of DW22 on cancer cells. DW22 exerts its anticancer
activity on cancer cells by activating RXR and inhibiting HDAC, and synergistically results in the activation of their target gene,
subsequently leads to the induction of cell differentiation and apoptosis, the inhibition of cell growth, and the suppression of cell invasion
and angiogenesis. HAT(histone acetyltransferase); CoA(Acetyl-CoA); RARE(RAR/RXR binding element).

(DAKO) visualized by 3,30–diaminobenzidine (DAB).
Slides were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. The
evaluation of both the intensity of immunohistochemical
staining and the proportion of positively stained epithelial
cells was previously described [29]. A detailed description
of the analysis is provided in the Supplementary Materials
and Methods.

The in vitro cell viability effects of DW22 were
determined by MTT assay. The cells (1 × 105 cells/
ml) were seeded into 96-well culture plates. After
overnight incubation, the cells were treated with various
concentrations of agents for 12, 36 or 48 h. Then 10 μl
MTT solution (2.5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each
well, and the plates were incubated for an additional 4
h at 37°C. After centrifugation (2500 rpm, 10 min), the
medium with MTT was aspirated, followed by the addition
of 100 μl DMSO. The optical density of each well was
measured at 570 nm with a Biotek SynergyTM HT Reader.

Compounds and reagents
DW22, with purity more than 98%, was
synthesized in Medicine Chemistry Laboratory at
Shenyang Pharmaceutical University (see Figure 2A).
Bexarotene and SAHA were obtained from Sigma,
USA. These agents were dissolved in DMSO to 100 mM
and stored at −20°C. Before treatment, the stock
solution is diluted to different concentrations. The final
concentration of DMSO in cultures is 0.1% (v/v) or
less. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide) and Propidium idodide (PI) were
purchased from Sigma, USA. The primary antibodies
against RXRα, HDAC1, Histone 3, Histone 4, p21

, PARP, Caspase-3, KLF4, VEGF, and β-actin were
got from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The
primary antibodies against Ki67, CD31, specific RXRα
siRNA, and control siRNA duplexes were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The primary
antibodies against acetylated Histone 3 and acetylated
Histone 4 were purchased from Millipore, USA. The
HDAC1 Silencer Select Validated siRNA was got from
Life technologies, USA.

RXRα coactivator recruitment assay
Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (TR-FRET) was performed with the LanthaScreen
TR-FRET RXRα coactivator assays according to the
instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Incubation
time was 2 hours in this study. The 520/490 TRFRET ratio was measured with Spectramax Paradigm
instrument (Molecular Devices, USA) with instrument
settings as described in the manufacturer’s instructions
for LanthaScreen assays. The following peptides were
used for the coactivator recruitment assay: PGC1α,
EAEEPSLLKKLLLAPANTQ.

RXR agonist activity assay
The A549 and MDA-MB-435 cells were
cotransfected with CRBPII-tk-luc (a gift from makishima.
makoto, Nihon University School of Medicine, JAPAN),
pCMX-hRXR, and pRL Renilla Luciferase Reporter
Vector (Promega Corporation). The ratio of these three
plasmids is 10: 3: 2. Five hours after transfection, the cells
were treated with different concentrations of DW-22 and
Bexarotene. After 48 h transfection, the RXR activity was
detected with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega Corporation). RXR activity is presented as the
means ± SD of three determinants.

Cell lines and cell culture
Human lung cancer cell lines A549, NCI-H460,
NCI-H1299, human breast cancer cell lines MDAMB-435, MDA-MB-436, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, human
leukemia cell line HL-60, and human umbelical vein cells
(HUVEC) were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). Human lung cancer cell line
LTEP-α2 was provided from National Center for Medical
Culture Collection (Shanghai, CHN). These cancer cells
were routinely cultured in RPMI-1640 or MEM medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5%
CO2. HUVEC cells were maintained as monolayer in
MCDB131 medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 1% (v/v) L-glutammine, 5 units/mL
heparin, and 50 mg/mL endothelial cell growth factor

HDAC whole-cell assay
The A549, NCI-H460, MDA-MB-436 and MDAMB-435 cells were treated with different concentrations
of DW22 and SAHA for 24 h before assays. Proteins were
isolated by using cell lysis buffer (Beyontime, CHN). The
protein concentration was measured by BCA protein assay
(Beyontime, CHN). The HDAC activity was measured
with a HDAC fluorescent activity assay kit (Biovison,
USA). In brief, cell lysates were incubated with the HDAC
substrate Boc-Lys(Ac)-pNA (10 mM) in HDAC assay

value of DMSO treated cells.

Clonogenicity assay
The A549 and MDA-MB-435 cells were treated
with different concentrations of DW22, Bexarotene, and
SAHA. Then the cells were incubated for an additional
7 days. Treatments were carried out in triplicate. The
colonies obtained were formalin fixed and stained with
hematoxylin. The colonies were counted and compared with
untreated cells.

Flow cytometry analysis
About 1 × 106 A549 and MDA-MB-435 cells were
harvested at room temperature after pre-treatment with
DW22, Bexarotene, and SAHA for 48 h. The supernatant
was removed, and ice-cold 70% ethanol was added.
Ethanol-fixed cells were re-suspended in PBS containing
0.1 mg/ml RNase and incubated at 37°C for 30 min.
The pelleted cells were suspended in 1.0 ml of 40 μg/ml
propidium iodide (PI) and analyzed by using a flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The cell
cycle distribution was estimated according to standard
procedures. The percentage of cells in the different cell
cycle phases (G0/G1, S, or G2/M phase) was calculated
using CELLQuest (Becton Dickinson) software. The cells
of sub-G1 peak were considered as apoptosis.
Analyses for apoptosis were also conducted with an
Annexin V–FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioVision).
Cells (1 × 106) were exposed to DW22 (20 μM) and
Bexarotene (20 μM) for 48 h. They were collected by
centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μL of 1 × binding
buffer. Annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC;
5 μL) and PI (5 μL) were added to the cells. After
incubation at room temperature for 5 minutes in the dark,
cells were analyzed by FACS using a flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson). Cells that stained Annexin V–FITC
only (early apoptosis) were analyzed.

NBT reduction assay
The HL60 cells were treated with different
concentrations of DW22 and Bexarotene for 4 days. Cells
were incubated in RPMI1640 (10% FBS) and an equal
volume of phosphate-buffer saline containing 0.2 w/w%
NBT (Sigma) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA, 200 ng/mL) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2
at 37°C for 30 min. The rate of cell differentiation was
calculated by the percentage of cells containing blue–
black formazan using more than 200 cells. Average of at
least three results for each assay was calculated.

Quantitative PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from A549 cells using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as described in the product
insert. The RNA was reverse RevertAid First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo) and PCR was done using
iQ SYBR Green Supermix and the CFX96 Real-Time
PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Primers used were
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).

Western blot analysis
About 1 × 107 cells were gathered after pre-treatment
for the indicated time periods as described previously.
Western blotting was performed as previously described
[30]. Briefly, an equal amount of total protein extracts from
cultured cells or tissues were fractionated by 10–15% SDSPAGE and then electrically transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Mouse or rabbit primary
antibodies and appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect the
designated proteins. The bound secondary antibodies on the
PVDF membrane were reacted with ECL detection reagents
(Pierce; Rockford, USA) and exposed to X-ray films.
Results were normalized to the internal control β-actin.

Chromatin immuno-precipitation assay (ChIP)
Using ChIP Assay Kit (Beyontime, CHN), A549
cells were prepared for the ChIP assay performed as the
instructions of the manufacturer. Anti-H3Ac antibody was
used to immunoprecipitate histones. p21WAF-1 promoter
primers were used to carry out PCR from DNA isolated
from ChIP experiment. PCR products were analyzed by
2.0% agarose/ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis. The
primer pairs used: Forward primer 5′-CGT GGT GGT

Micro (Molecular Devices) after photographed (400 × ).

Real-time cell analysis (RTCA)

RNA interference of RXRα was done using an
HDAC1 or RXRα–targeted short interfering RNA
(siRNA; Santa Cruz). A nonspecific scramble siRNA was
used as control. For transfection, A549, MDA-MB-435,
HL-60 and HUVECs cells (5 × 104) were seeded in 96
or six-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells
were transfected with scramble siRNA, RXRα–targeted
siRNA(200 pmol/L) or HDAC1- targeted siRNA(90
pmol/L) using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The efficiency
of siRNA was confirmed by western blot. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, the cells were treated with DMSO
(control) or different concentrations of DW22 for 12,
24, or 48 h. The cells were collected and processed for
analysis of MTT, NBT, FACS, migration, tube formation
and immunoblotting as described above.

RNA interference of HDAC1 and RXRα

The CIM-plate contains 16 modified Boyden
chambers, which can be used independently to measure
cell migration in real time through 8 μm pores of a
polyethylene terephthalate membrane onto gold electrodes
on the underside of themembrane using the xCELLigence
analyser system (ACEA Biosciences). Experiments were
set up according to the manufacturer’s instructions with
the membrane uncoated (migration). A chemotactic signal
for movement was provided by inoculating 30,000–
50,000 cells in serum-free medium in the upper chamber
and supplying 10% FBS in the lower chamber (10 ng/
ml VEGF with the same relevant concentration of drug).
Cell index (electrical impedance) was monitored every
5 min for the duration of the experiment. The cell index
represents the capacity for cell migration, and the slope
of the curve can be related to the migration velocity of
tumor cells. The cell index thus reflects the tumor cell’s
migratory capacity.

Mouse xenograft tumors study
To determine the in vivo anti-tumor activity of
DW22, viable A549 cells (5 × 106/ 100 μl PBS per
mouse) and MDA-MB-435 cells (1 × 107/100 μl PBS
per mouse), as confirmed by trypan blue staining, and
then subcutaneously (s.c.) injected into the right flank
of 7–8 week old male Balb/c nude mice or SCID mice,
respectively. When the average s.c. tumor volume
reached 100 mm3, the mice were randomly divided
into various treatment and control group (5–6 mice per
group). Tumor size was measured once every two days
with a caliper (calculated volume = shortest diameter2 ×
longest diameter/2). Body weight, diet consumption and
tumor size were recorded once every two days. After
two or three weeks, the mice were sacrificed and solid
tumors were removed for further analysis. This study was
performed in strict accordance with the recommendations
in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
of the Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. The protocol
was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal
Experiments of the Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

Transwell migration assay
Invasion of HUVECs was assayed using Transwell
(Corning Costar) with 6.5 mm diameter polycarbonate
filters (8-Am pore size). Briefly, the lower surface of the
filter was coated with Matrigel. Fresh M200 medium (1%
FBS) containing 20 ng/ml VEGF was placed in the lower
wells. The cells were trypsinized and suspended at a final
concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in M200 containing
1% FBS. Various concentrations of DW22 were given to
the cells for 30 min at room temperature before seeding.
One hundred microliters of the cell suspension were
loaded into each of the upper wells, and the chamber
was incubated at 37°C for 12 h. The cells were fixed and
stained with Calcein-AM. Non-invasion cells on the upper
surface of the filter were removed by wiping with a cotton
swab, and chemotaxis was quantified with a high content
drug screening system ImageXpressR Micro (Molecular
Devices) by counting cells that had migrated to the lower
side of the filter.

Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay
Tissues embedded in paraffin were cut to a section of
4 μm, deparaffinized, and treated with citrate buffer. Then,
they were blocked with avidin/biotin for 20 min. The slides
were incubated with anti-Ki67 or CD31 for overnight at
4°C. Next, the slides were treated with secondary antibody
with horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit for 1–3 h and
developed with 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich).
Finally, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.
