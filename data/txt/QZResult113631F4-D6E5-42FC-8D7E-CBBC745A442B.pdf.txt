Phenotype Switching: Tumor Cell Plasticity as a Resistance
Mechanism and Target for Therapy

Abstract
Mutations in BRAF are present in the majority of patients with melanoma, rendering these tumors sensitive to
targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Unfortunately, resistance almost invariably develops. Recently,
a phenomenon called "phenotype switching" has been identiﬁed as an escape route. By switching from a
proliferative to an invasive state, melanoma cells can acquire resistance to these targeted therapeutics.
Interestingly, phenotype switching bears a striking resemblance to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal–like transition
that has been described to occur in cancer stem cells in other tumor types. We propose that these changes are
manifestations of one and the same underlying feature, namely a dynamic and reversible phenotypic tumor cell
plasticity that renders a proportion of cells both more invasive and resistant to therapy. At the same time, the
speciﬁc characteristics of these tumor cell populations offer potential for being explored as target for therapeutic
intervention. Cancer Res; 74(21); 5937–41. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin
cancer, which is due to its propensity to rapidly metastasize.
Whereas localized disease can be cured with surgery, treatment possibilities for metastatic melanoma have long been
limited owing to minimal response of the disease to conventional chemotherapy. A decade ago, it was discovered that up
to 70% of melanomas display genetic alterations in the MAPK
pathway, with mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF (50%)
and NRAS (20%) being the most prevalent (1). The most
common mutation in BRAF results in a valine to glutamic acid
substitution at codon 600 (BRAFV600E), rendering the BRAF
kinase constitutively active.
The identiﬁcation of hyperactivated MAPK signaling as a
common driver of melanoma initiation and progression has
led to the development of speciﬁc inhibitors targeting this
pathway. Vemurafenib, a BRAFV600E inhibitor, was the ﬁrst
targeted melanoma drug to become standard of care in the
clinic after demonstrating an impressive response rate (48%)
and an increase in progression-free survival (5.3 months)
compared with the chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine
(5% and 1.6 months, respectively), hitherto the standard-of1

care treatment (2). Initial excitement weaned, however, once it
became clear that despite this impressive initial response
almost all patients developed resistance against BRAF inhibitors. Companion treatment, in the form of combining a
BRAFV600E inhibitor (dabrafenib) with a MEK inhibitor (trametinib), resulted in more durable median response rates (3),
but here too, resistance did eventually occur.
Reactivation of the MAPK pathway confers resistance to
targeted melanoma therapy
Multiple efforts have been undertaken to identify the
molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition (4, 5). These studies have revealed a strong
dependency of melanomas on active MAPK signaling:
around 70% of the uncovered resistance mechanisms to
BRAFV600E inhibitors result in reactivation of this pathway.
Examples include activating mutations in NRAS, as well as
ampliﬁcation or alternative splicing of the mutated BRAF
gene (4, 5). Downstream reactivation of the MAPK pathway
has also been described, for instance through activating
mutations in MEK1/2 (4, 5). Resistance toward the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition also involves reactivation of the MAPK pathway, again through ampliﬁcation or
alternative splicing of BRAF or mutation of MEK2 (6). Taken
together, these large-scale genome-sequencing efforts
underscore the importance of an intact MAPK pathway for
melanoma survival.
Although other MAPK-independent mechanisms have also
been identiﬁed, resistance still cannot be explained in up to
40% of all patient samples (4–6). This suggests that additional
and perhaps alternative routes facilitating resistance, likely
involving epigenetic events or stromal factors (7), remain to be
discovered. New data, which will be discussed below, suggest
that tumor cell plasticity, resulting in dynamic phenotypic
heterogeneity, should not be ignored.

Phenotype switching as an alternative resistance
mechanism
It was recently shown that melanoma cell lines with high
levels of the transcription factor and master regulator of
melanocyte development MITF (MITFhigh) were sensitive to
either BRAFV600E or MEK inhibition, whereas MITFlow cells
displayed intrinsic resistance against these targeted drugs.
Furthermore, expression of MITF inversely correlated with
the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL (Mueller
and Peeper, unpublished data; ref. 8). Interestingly, both
MITF and AXL are part of a gene cluster that was identiﬁed
almost a decade ago by RNA expression proﬁling of a large
cohort of melanoma cell lines. These experiments revealed that
cell lines could be clustered based on their metastatic potential, independent of their BRAF or NRAS mutation status (9).
Cells with a so-called "proliferative" signature had a higher
proliferation rate and expressed melanocyte differentiation
markers, including MITF. In contrast, cell lines with an "invasive" signature displayed increased motility and migration,
expressed genes involved in microenvironment modulation,
had low levels of MITF, but higher levels of negative regulators
of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway. This included Wnt5a, which
had previously been implicated in melanoma metastasis (10,
11). Other studies have conﬁrmed that melanoma cell lines
segregate into these distinct expression clusters (12, 13).
The recent ﬁnding that MITFlow cells are intrinsically resistant
to targeted therapy (8) suggests that acquisition of an invasive
phenotype results in resistance toward MAPK pathway inhibitors. Indeed, high expression of Wnt5a, a marker of the invasive
phenotype, was found to induce resistance to BRAF inhibitors
in patients (14). In vitro–acquired data show the same trend —
the invasive phenotype can be linked to both intrinsic and
acquired resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors (13, 15). Even
more striking, proliferative melanoma cells can adopt invasive
characteristics upon MAPK inhibition (16), indicating that
targeted therapy may actually promote phenotype switching,
potentially resulting in metastasis. This hypothesis is supported
by the discovery that BRAF inhibition can induce invasion and
metastasis in vivo when tumors are therapy resistant (17).
The effects of phenotype switching on therapeutic outcome
should not be underestimated: whereas the proliferative population may be the major contributor to measurable tumor
growth, the invasive cells might actually be the more problematic component. The above ﬁndings suggest that melanoma cells can use phenotype switching as a mechanism to
acquire resistance, allowing them to evade growth arrest. As
invasive cells seem less dependent on an intact MAPK pathway,
reﬂected by their reduced sensitivity to BRAF- and MEK
inhibition, phenotype switching may offer a crucial escape: it
would essentially buy cells time to accumulate additional (epi)
genetic alterations, which would then allow them to revert
back to a proliferative phenotype and to survive in the presence
of BRAF- or MEK inhibition.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induces
resistance to targeted therapy in other tumor types
Although phenotype switching was only recently (re)discovered in melanoma, which has its developmental origins in the

5938

embryonic neural crest, the transition to an invasive state was
already shown to induce resistance to targeted therapy in
several epithelial tumors. For instance, an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene signature corresponds to
resistance of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to
the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (18, 19). Resistant cell lines displayed mesenchymal features, including high vimentin and
ZEB1 expression levels, and were more migratory, suggesting a
switch to an invasive phenotype (20). Interestingly, these EMT
features coincided with an upregulation of AXL, a marker of
invasive cells in melanoma. Importantly, AXL was also upregulated in patients with NSCLC with acquired erlotinib resistance (21).
In other tumor types, including head and neck, bladder,
and pancreatic cancer, resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies was also associated with EMT (22–24). Furthermore, an
EMT switch was observed as resistance mechanism to other
targeted therapies. For instance, HER2þ breast cancer cells
with high expression of the EMT markers Slug and Snail
displayed intrinsic resistance toward the HER2-targeting
antibody trastuzumab, which was reverted by knockdown
of these transcription factors (25). Also, loss of MED12,
which conferred resistance in several tumor types to multiple targeted therapies, including EGFR and MEK inhibitors,
was shown to induce a partial EMT (26). Altogether, these
data indicate that EMT is connected to therapy resistance.
In fact, it suggests that tumors from different developmental
origins can switch from a proliferative to an invasive phenotype to acquire resistance. The ﬁnding that the invasive
gene signature previously determined in melanoma (9)
contains genes that are involved in EMT further supports
this hypothesis.
Phenotype switching, EMT, and cancer stem cell
plasticity: three names for the same phenomenon?
An intriguing ﬁnding is that invasive melanoma cells possess
some features that are attributed to cancer stem cells (CSC) in
other tumor types. CSCs are endowed with self-renewal capacities and are commonly held responsible for tumor initiation
and maintenance, metastasis formation, and recurrence after
(targeted) therapy. It was previously shown that immortalized
mammary epithelial cells undergoing EMT acquire stem cell–
like properties (27), suggesting a direct link between EMT and a
"stemness" phenotype. This link is preserved in cancer, resulting in therapy-resistant tumor cells that harbor both invasive
and self-renewal properties (28).
Importantly, CSCs from epithelial tumors appear to exist in
two distinct states: a proliferative, epithelial state versus a
migratory state that displays EMT features (29, 30). More
importantly, these two populations are plastic and can interconvert (29, 30), thereby potentially playing a role in escaping
therapy. For example, in HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer cells,
trastuzumab resistance resulted in expansion of the migratory
CSC fraction (31). Strikingly, AXL overexpression, the above
discussed marker of phenotype-switched and therapy-resistant melanoma cells, can induce EMT in breast cancer cells,
whereas AXL inhibition reduces self-renewal and tumorgenicity of breast CSCs (32).

Phenotype Switching and Tumor Plasticity

tumor cell plasticity remains incompletely understood: a large
proportion of cancer cells may theoretically be able to acquire
CSC properties de novo as a result of dedifferentiation.
Given that melanoma cell lines tend to retain their phenotype (whether proliferative or invasive) when cultured in vitro,
phenotype switching may occur as a result of three-dimensional growth in vivo, perhaps in response to signals from the
extracellular environment, similar to the way in which "stemness" can be thought of as a state that is determined by
microenvironmental cues (e.g., a niche). Indeed, hypoxia signaling through HIF1a was recently linked to both the induction of an invasive phenotype and therapy resistance in melanoma by inducing the expression of Ror2, a receptor for
Wnt5a (15, 36). This conﬁrms the previously suggested role
for Wnt5a in melanoma cell invasion (10, 11, 37). Of note, a
population of quiescent and migratory, mesenchymal-like
CSCs was recently described at the invasive front of breast
tumors, whereas a more proliferative, epithelial-like population of CSCs was located toward the center of the tumor,
suggesting that this too could be regulated by the tumor
microenvironment (30).
Taken together, the CSC and phenotype-switching hypotheses may be manifestations of the same underlying tumor cell
plasticity, which might, at least partially, manifest itself as an
EMT-like phenomenon (Fig. 1). Although the phenotypeswitching model encompasses distinct phenotypes, which are

The shared features between epithelial CSCs undergoing
EMT and (nonepithelial) melanoma cells undergoing phenotype switching are interesting, given that the existence of CSCs
in melanoma is still debated. First, it has been shown that
almost all melanoma cells, and not just a deﬁned subpopulation, can initiate tumor growth and restore tumor heterogeneity upon transplantation into immune-deﬁcient mice
(33, 34). Second, although the H3K4 demethylase JARID1B was
shown to be required for continuous growth and melanoma
maintenance, its expression was dynamic and did not select for
tumor-initiating cells (35), suggesting that the putative CSC
population in melanoma is more plastic than the CSC population in other tumor types. Indeed, upon directly comparing
melanoma cells with proliferative or invasive phenotypes, both
populations were able to initiate tumor formation in vivo,
although invasive melanoma cells required much longer to
grow out than proliferative cells. Tumors initiated by cells with
either a proliferative or an invasive phenotype were indistinguishable and showed heterogeneous MITF expression, suggesting that cells were able to switch their phenotype in both
directions in vivo (9, 10). Thus, accumulating data support a
model in which the bulk of melanoma cells have the potential
to undergo phenotype switching. However, only a minority of
the cells does so in vivo at any given time. In contrast, nonmelanoma CSCs are generally shown to comprise only a minor
fraction of all cancer cells, although it should be noted that

translates to a complex spectrum
of phenotypic heterogeneity, which
in turn affects the cells' sensitivity
to drug treatment and propensity to
metastasize. Both the phenotypeswitching hypothesis and the CSC
hypothesis support a continuous
spectrum in which the cellular state
is dynamic, rather than ﬁxed.
Tumor cells can switch
phenotypes, such that they
become more or less invasive/
proliferative (as a result of EMTand MET-like conversions) and
more or less differentiated
(according to their developmental
history and extent of lineage
speciﬁcation). Switching can occur
either as an intrinsic property of
tumor growth in a threedimensional environment or in
response to therapy. Invasive,
relatively undifferentiated
melanoma cells (lower-right
quadrant), which are more
refractory to treatment, share many
similarities with an EMT-like subset
of CSCs. In contrast, current
treatment strategies are aimed at
eradicating the most proliferative
cells, which may not necessarily be
the most malignant.

either proliferative or invasive, a spectrum of phenotypes
might exist in tumors, rather than two separate pools, much
like is seen for EMT.

Outlook
As more targeted therapeutics are ﬁnding their way into the
clinic, the concepts discussed here are relevant for a broad
variety of tumor types. Future strategies to identify novel drugs
and active treatments will have to take into consideration that
both proliferative and invasive (or CSC) populations should be
targeted. This may require a change in how drug efﬁcacy is
assessed, such as the addition of secondary transplantation
experiments in preclinical animal studies (38, 39). Given that
melanoma cells can resort to phenotype switching as a therapy
escape mechanism, it should be considered as a direct therapeutic target. The potential success is illustrated by a recent
study (40), in which methotrexate was used to increase cellular
levels of MITF, thereby forcing melanoma cells to adopt a
proliferative, more differentiated phenotype associated with
expression of the melanocyte-speciﬁc TYR gene. This in turn

sensitized the cells to a TYR-processed prodrug, which induced
apoptosis in all melanoma cells (but not in nontransformed
melanocytes), irrespective of their mutational status (40).
Summarizing, regardless whether phenotype switching is an
active goal of the treatment itself, it is a phenomenon that
cannot be ignored, especially given that some treatments might
induce switching to the invasive phenotype, thereby promoting
metastasis. A more in-depth understanding of tumor cell
plasticity, as well as the challenges and promises it provides,
will now have to make its way from bench to bedside.
