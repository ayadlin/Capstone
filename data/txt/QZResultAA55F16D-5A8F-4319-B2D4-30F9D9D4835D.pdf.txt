How the activities of adult stem cells and cancer cells are regulated by environmental cues
through surface receptors is poorly understood. Angiopoietin-like proteins (Angptls), a
family of seven secreted glycoproteins, are known to support the activity of hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs) in vitro and in vivo 1–10. Angptls also play important roles in lipid
metabolism, angiogenesis, and inflammation but were considered “orphan ligands” as no
receptors were identified 3,11,12. Here we report that the immune inhibitory receptors, human
leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) and its mouse ortholog paired Iglike receptor (PirB), are receptors for several Angptls. LILRB2 and PirB are expressed on
human HSCs and mouse HSCs, respectively. Angptls bound to LILRB2 and to PirB and
supported ex vivo expansion of HSCs. In the mouse MLL-AF9 and AML1-ETO9a
transplantation acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models, a deficiency in intracellular
signaling of PirB resulted in increased differentiation of leukemia cells, revealing that PirB

supports leukemia development. Our study indicates unexpected functional significance of
classical immune inhibitory receptors in maintenance of stemness of normal adult stem cells
and in support of cancer development.

Author Manuscript

We used multiple approaches, including expression cloning, to identify the receptor(s) for
Angptls. Human LILRB2, when ectopically expressed on BAF3 cells, enabled the cells to
specifically bind GST-Angptl5 as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 1a). LILRB2 is a
member of the immune inhibitory B type subfamily of LILR receptors 13 and contains four
Ig-domains and three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. Using flow
cytometry analysis, we further demonstrated that LILRB2-overexpressing 293T cells had
enhanced binding to several Angptls, especially Angptl2 and GST-Angptl5 (Fig. 1b,
Supplementary Fig. 1a–b). Angptl2 and GST-Angptl5 also bound to LILRB3- and LILRB5overexpressing cells, though with a lower affinity than to LILRB2-expressing cells
(Supplementary Table 1). In addition, Angptl1 and Angptl7 bound to LAIR1 14 overexpressing 293T cells (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 2). Angptls did not
bind to LILRAs, LILRB1, or LILRB4 (Supplementary Table 1).

Author Manuscript

Because Angptl2 and GST-Angptl5 bound to LILRB2-expressing cells better than did other
Angptls, we further assessed the molecular interaction between Angptl2/Angptl5 and
LILRB2. Co-transfection of Angptl2 or Angptl5 with LILRB2 extracellular domain (ECD)
fused to human IgG-Fc (LILRB2-hFc) into 293T cells followed by immunoprecipitation
(IP)/western blot revealed that both Angptl2 and Angptl5 interacted with the extracellular
domain of LILRB2 but not that of Tie-2 (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1c). The direct
interactions between Angptls and LILRB2 were confirmed by in vitro co-IP using purified
Angptl2-FLAG or GST-Angptl5 and LILRB2-hFc (Supplementary Fig. 1d) and by surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) (Supplementary Fig. 3). A liquid-phase binding assay with 125Ilabelled GST-Angptl5 demonstrated that the interaction between Angptl5 and cell surface
LILRB2 was specific and saturable, with half maximal saturation of the interaction as 5.5 ±
1.1 nM (Figs. 1d–e). While untagged Angptls bind to LILRB2, the type or the position of
tagging could affect the binding (Supplementary Table 2).
Because several Angptls support expansion of HSCs 4–12, we sought to determine whether
Angptls bound to LILRB2 or LAIR1 on primary human cord blood cells. Flow cytometry
analysis showed that Angptls 1, 2, 5, and 7 all bound to LILRB2+ human cord blood cells;
Angptl2 and GST-Angptl5 had higher affinities (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4,
Supplementary Table 1). Angptl1 and Angptl7’s bindings to LAIR1+ human cord blood
cells were relatively weak (Supplementary Fig. 5). We therefore focused on studying the
binding of Angptl2 and Angptl5 to LILRB2 in subsequent experiments.

Author Manuscript

We determined whether LILRB2 was expressed on human HSCs. Flow cytometry and realtime RT-PCR analyses revealed that LILRB2 was expressed on the surface of 40–95% of
human cord blood CD34+CD38−CD90+ cells (95% in the experiment shown in Fig. 2b;
Supplementary Fig. 6); this population is enriched for HSCs. GST-Angptl5 treatment
induced increased phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
CAMKII and CAMKIV in human cord blood mononuclear cells (Supplementary Fig. 7). It
is of note that CAMKIV is required for maintenance of the potency of HSCs 15. Suppression

of LILRB2 expression with shRNAs effectively reduced Angptl binding (Supplementary
Fig. 8). Importantly, the silencing of LILRB2 resulted in decreased repopulation of human
cord blood HSCs as measured by reconstitution analysis in NOD/SCID mice (1%
repopulation from cultured knockdown cells compared to 17% repopulation from cultured
normal cells in medium STFA5; Fig. 2c). Together, these data indicate that the Angptl5
supports expansion of human cord blood HSCs 1 in a process at least partially mediated by
the surface receptor LILRB2.
The paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) is the only mouse membrane ortholog of
human LILRBs 16,17. Angptl2, Angptl3, and GST-Angptl5 bound to PirB as determined by
flow cytometry (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 9) and by Co-IP (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig.
10). As were human cord blood HSCs, mouse HSCs were also enriched for PirB expression
(Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 11).

Author Manuscript

To study the function of PirB in mouse HSCs, we used PirB-deficient (PirBTM) mice 18, in
which four exons encoding the transmembrane domain and part of the intracellular domain
were deleted. PirBTM cells freshly isolated from 3-week old of mice had significantly
decreased CAMKIV phosphorylation, and binding of Angptl to PirB induced
phosphorylation of PirB, recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2, and CAMKIV activation
(Supplementary Figs. 12–13). These results suggest that certain Angptls may be the ligands
of PirB that activate CAMKIV in vivo.

Author Manuscript

Because SHP-2 and CAMKIV are required for the repopulation of HSCs 15,19, and the
chemical inhibition of CAMKII, a homolog of CAMKIV, induces differentiation and
suppresses proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells 20, we sought to determine whether PirB
was important for HSC activity. While the adult PirBTM mice have certain immune and
neuronal defects, they are grossly normal in hematopoiesis 16,18. Interestingly, competitive
repopulation showed that PirBTM fetal liver HSCs had approximately 50% decreased
repopulation activity (Supplementary Fig. 14). Moreover, although Angptl2 and Angptl5
had little effect on ex vivo expansion of adult PirBTM HSCs, they supported ex vivo
expansion of adult wild-type (WT) HSCs (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 14), as we
previously demonstrated 2. Collectively, our results indicate that Angptls bind human
LILRB2 and mouse PirB to support HSC repopulation.

Author Manuscript

Based on our in silico analysis of a pool of 9004 samples described previously 21, the level
of LILRB2 mRNA is at least 4-fold higher in the human acute monoblastic and monocytic
leukemia cells (M5 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)) than in other AML cells
(Supplementary Fig. 15). Since human acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia cells are
often associated with rearrangement of MLL (a histone methyltransferase deemed a positive
global regulator of gene transcription), we used a retroviral MLL-AF9 transplantation mouse
model 22,23 to further examine the role of PirB in regulation of AML development. WT or
PirBTM donor Lin− cells infected by retroviral MLL-AF9-IRES-YFP were used to induce
AML as previously described 22,23. We examined PirB expression in YFP+Mac-1+Kit+ cells
that may be enriched for AML initiating activity 22,23, and found that about 80%
YFP+Mac-1+Kit+ cells were PirB+ (Fig. 4a). We next investigated whether PirB was
required for the induction of AML by MLL-AF9. Mice transplanted with MLL-AF9-

transduced WT cells developed AML and died within approximately 5 weeks, whereas those
transplanted with MLL-AF9-transduced PirBTM cells were resistant to the induction of
MLL-AF9 and developed AML much more slowly (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 16). The
significantly delayed development of the PirBTM leukemia was correlated with about 50%
lower numbers of white blood cells in circulation and a much less severe infiltration of
myeloid leukemia cells into the liver and spleen (Fig. 4c–d). Consistently, PirB deficiency
caused an approximately 50% reduction of YFP+Mac-1+Kit+ cells in both bone marrow and
peripheral blood (Fig. 4d). There were more CD3+ or B220+ cells in mice that received
MLL-AF9-transduced PirBTM donor cells than in those given WT cells (Fig. 4d). These
results demonstrate that PirB mediated signaling is associated with faster AML development
and greater numbers of YFP+Mac-1+Kit+ AML cells in vivo.

Author Manuscript

We further assessed whether PirB potentially regulates differentiation and self-renewal of
AML cells. CFU assays showed that extrinsic Angptls stimulation led to increased CFU
numbers in WT but not PirBTM AML cells, again indicating PirB directly mediates
Angptls’ effects (Supplementary Fig. 16d). In addition, WT AML cells formed mostly
compact colonies, whereas PirBTM cells tended to form more diffuse ones (Fig. 4e). The
formation of diffuse colonies indicates high differentiation potential 24. The inhibition of
differentiation of AML cells by PirB is accordant with previous reports that PirB inhibits
differentiation of myeloid-derived suppressive cells 25 and osteoclasts 26, as well as our data
showing that endogenous Angptls inhibit differentiation and increase replating efficiency of
hematopoietic progenitors (Supplementary Fig. 17). Moreover, PirBTM primary CFUs were
unable to form secondary colonies upon replating (Fig. 4f), suggesting that PirB supports
self-renewal of AML CFU cells.

Finally, we analyzed the molecular signaling triggered by the binding of Angptls to PirB in
AML cells. PirBTM AML cells had decreased phosphorylation of phosphatase SHP-2 (Fig.
4h), which is known to be associated with LILRB receptors and is an oncogene that supports
leukemia development 13,16,18,27. Angptls also stimulated SHP-2 phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. 13c). Similar to untransformed PirBTM cells, PirBTM AML cells had
decreased CAMKIV activation (data not shown). Furthermore, WT Mac-1+Kit+ cells had
much greater expression of leukemia initiation/maintenance genes 22,23 but dramatically
decreased expression of myeloid differentiation genes as determined by DNA microarray
analyses (Fig. 4g). Quantative RT-PCR confirmed the increased expression of several HoxA
genes, Meis1, Eya1, Myb, and Mef2c in WT Mac-1+Kit+ cells than PirBTM counterparts
(Supplementary Fig. 18); these genes are critical for initiation or maintenance of MLL
rearranged AML 22,23. Similar to the MLL-AF9 model, the deficiency of PirB in the AML1ETO9a leukemia model led to decreased leukemia progenitors and increased differentiated
cells (Supplementary Fig. 19). Collectively, these results suggest that the binding of Angptls
to PirB promotes leukemia development, likely through inhibiting differentiation of AML
cells.
LILRB2 or PirB is known to bind to other ligands including various MHC class I
molecules 28 and myelin inhibitors 17. It will be important to investigate the in vivo context
in which these different ligands bind LILRB and induce signaling. As Angptls can be
abundantly expressed by many types of cells including those from endocrine organs 11 and

potential BM niche (endothelium and adipocytes 9,11), and can be induced by hypoxia 11,
these secreted factors may have important direct and indirect effects on the activities of
HSCs and leukemia stem cells in vivo. While the LILRB/PirB receptors were reported to
suppress activation of differentiated immune cells and inhibit neurite outgrowth of neural
cells 16,17, they support HSC repopulation and inhibit differentiation of AML cells. This
result suggests the significant importance of these “inhibitory receptors” in maintenance of
stemness of normal stem cells and support of leukemia development. In contrast to the
“stimulatory receptors” such as IFN receptors or toll-like receptors that activate and induce
differentiation of HSCs upon inflammation 29, LILRB2 or PirB may function as a sensor of
inflammation through binding to the inflammatory Angptls 12 and protect HSCs from
excessive activation and exhaustion. Adult stem cells and cancer cells likely require both
stimulatory receptors and inhibitory receptors to maintain the balance of their cell fates.

populations in AML blood or bone marrow were performed by using anti-Mac-1-APC, antiKit-PE, anti-Gr-1-PE, anti-CD3-APC, and anti-B220-PE.
Uncultured or cultured progenies of human cells were pooled together and the indicated
portions were injected intravenously via the retro-orbital route into sub-lethally irradiated
(250 rad) 6–8 week old NOD/SCID mice. Eight weeks after transplantation, bone marrow
nucleated cells from transplanted animals were analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence
of human cells as we described 1,32.
CFU assays

Author Manuscript

Two thousand YFP+Mac-1+Kit+ BM cells from AML mice were plated in methylcellulose
(M3534, Stem Cell Technologies) for CFU-GM assays, according to the manufacturer’s
protocols and our previously published protocol 35. After 7 days, 2000 cells from initially
plated three dishes were used for secondary replating.
Surface plasmon resonance

Author Manuscript

Biacore 2000 and CM5 chips were used to analyze binding of purified Angptls to the
LILRB2 extracellular domain fused to hFc, using a method similar to that previously
described 36. Recombinant protein A (Pierce) was pre-immobilized in two flow cells
(~2,000 RU) using the amine-coupling kit from GE. LILRB2-hFc was injected into one of
the flow cells to be captured by the protein A to reach ~300 response units (RU). GSTAngptl5 was injected over the immobilized LILRB2 in HBS-EP (GE) containing 0.01 M
HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate 20. Each binding sensorgram from the
sample flow cell, containing a captured LILRB2-hFc, was corrected for the protein A
coupled cell control. Following each injection of an antigen solution, which induced the
binding reaction, and the dissociation period during which the running buffer was infused,
the protein A surface was regenerated by the injection of the regeneration solution
containing 10 mM Na3PO4 (pH 2.5) and 500 mM NaCl. All captured LILRB2-hFc, with and
without Angptl5 bound, was completely removed, and another cycle begun. All
measurements were performed at 25°C with a flow rate of 30 µL/min.
GSEA analysis
Gene set enrichment analysis 37 was performed using GSEA v2.0 software (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) with 1,000 phenotype permutations, and normalized
enrichment score (NES) and false discovery rate q-value (FDR q-val) were calculated.
Leukemia-stem-cell and macrophage development gene sets were obtained from the
indicated publication 23,38.

Statistics
Two-tailed student t-test was performed to evaluate significance between experimental
groups, unless otherwise is indicated. The survival rates of the two groups will be analyzed
using a log-rank test.
