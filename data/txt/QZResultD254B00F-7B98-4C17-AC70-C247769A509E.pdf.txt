Abstract

Introduction

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors (PDGFR) and
their ligands play critical roles in several human malignancies. Sunitinib is a clinically approved multitargeted tyrosine
kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor, c-KIT, and PDGFR, and has shown clinical
activity in various solid tumors. Activation of PDGFR
signaling has been described in gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (PDGFRA mutations) as well as in chronic myeloid
leukemia (BCR-PDGFRA translocation), and sunitinib can
yield clinical benefit in both settings. However, the discovery
of PDGFR activating mutations or gene rearrangements in
other tumor types could reveal additional patient populations
who might benefit from treatment with anti-PDGFR therapies,
such as sunitinib. Using a high-throughput cancer cell line
screening platform, we found that only 2 of 637 tested human
tumor-derived cell lines show significant sensitivity to singleagent sunitinib exposure. These two cell lines [a non–smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a rhabdomyosarcoma] showed
expression of highly phosphorylated PDGFRA. In the sunitinib-sensitive adenosquamous NSCLC cell line, PDGFRA
expression was associated with focal PFGRA gene amplification, which was similarly detected in a small fraction of
squamous cell NSCLC primary tumor specimens. Moreover, in
this NSCLC cell line, focal amplification of the gene encoding
the PDGFR ligand PDGFC was also detected, and silencing
PDGFRA or PDGFC expression by RNA interference inhibited
proliferation. A similar codependency on PDGFRA and PDGFC
was observed in the sunitinib-sensitive rhabdomyosarcoma
cell line. These findings suggest that, in addition to
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, rare tumors that show
PDGFC-mediated PDGFRA activation may also be clinically
responsive to pharmacologic PDGFRA or PDGFC inhibition.

Sunitinib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that
potently inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and c-KIT receptor kinases
(1). In renal cell carcinoma, sunitinib showed superiority over
standard IFN-a therapy (2); sunitinib is now recommended for
previously untreated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
Sunitinib is also approved for treatment of imatinib-refractory
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), many of which harbor
activating c-KIT or PDGF receptor (PDGFR) kinase domain
mutations (3). A recent phase II clinical study has revealed efficacy
of single-agent sunitinib in advanced non–small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients (4). Accumulating evidence indicates that
inhibition of VEGF signaling using various antiangiogenic agents
can suppress tumor growth and improve patient survival (2, 5, 6);
however, it is unclear from studies involving multikinase inhibitors,
such as sunitinib, as to the relative contribution of VEGF receptor
inhibition in suppressing tumor growth.
The PDGFR/PDGF system includes two receptors (PDGFRA and
PDGFRB) and four ligands (PDGFA, PDGFB, PDGFC, and PDGFD;
ref. 7). Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization, enabling
autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues and subsequent
recruitment of a variety of signal transduction molecules (8).
PDGFR regulates normal cellular growth and differentiation (9),
and expression of activated PDGFR promotes oncogenic transformation (10), suggesting that activating mutations or gene
rearrangements could play a role in human tumorigenesis.
Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies showed that inhibition of
PDGFRA signaling disrupts cancer cell survival in the subset of
GISTs with activating PDGFRA mutations (11, 12). In a recent study
of 150 NSCLC patient samples, activated PDGFRA was detected in
13% of cases (13), suggesting that a subset of these patients might
benefit from therapies directed against PDGFRA. Moreover,
PDGFRA overexpression has been observed in metastatic versus
nonmetastatic medulloblastoma patient samples, and disrupting
PDGFRA function inhibited the metastatic potential of medulloblastoma cells in vitro (14).
We recently reported the development of a high-throughput
platform for profiling a large panel of human cancer cell lines with
molecularly targeted inhibitors to identify subsets with significant
sensitivity (15). That analysis revealed several examples of
genotype-associated sensitivities to selective kinase inhibitors,
showing the utility of this strategy to reveal cell autonomous
tumor cell responses to anticancer agents. Here, we describe the
profiling of 637 cancer cell lines for sensitivity to single-agent

sunitinib, using a monoculture format that precludes any
contribution of drug effects on angiogenesis. Our studies revealed
that the majority of tested cell lines are highly refractory to
sunitinib. Of the two cell lines showing sunitinib sensitivity, both
were found to express high levels of PDGFRA and PDGFC mRNA
and phosphorylated PDGFRA protein. ShRNA knockdown of
PDGFRA was as effective as sunitinib in decreasing cell
proliferation in both cell lines, and targeting the PDGFC ligand
alone was similarly effective.
Our findings suggest that whereas antiangiogenesis activity
probably accounts for the majority of the clinical benefit associated
with sunitinib treatment in solid tumors, in rare cases, beyond
PDGFRA-mutant GISTs, activated PDGFRA may be the critical
target, and that selective PDGFRA inhibitors may be useful in the
clinical management of a subset of tumors that exhibit PDGFRA
activation. Moreover, in tumors with evidence of PDGFC ligand
overexpression, neutralizing antibodies may be an equally effective
therapeutic modality.

Materials and Methods
Human cancer cell lines and cell viability assays. Human cancer cell
lines were obtained from commercial vendors and were maintained and
tested for viability using an automated platform, as previously described
(15). Cells were treated for 72 h with 1 Amol/L sunitinib and then assayed
for cytostatic or cytotoxic responses. We elected to use this concentration
based on steady-state plasma concentrations of f0.2 Amol/L at clinically
recommended doses of sunitinib in patients and based on the experimental
time points addressed in the studies.
Protein detection. Immunodetection of proteins following SDS-PAGE
was done using standard protocols. Equal protein loading was assessed
using a h-tubulin antibody (Sigma). Akt, extracellular signal–regulated
kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), phospho-Erk1/2 (T202/Y204), PDGFRA, phosphoPDGFRA (Y720), phospho-PDGFRA (Y754), signal transducer and activator
of transcription 3 (STAT3), and phospho-STAT3 (S727) antibodies were
from Cell Signaling Technology. The phospho-Akt (S473) antibody was from
BioSource International. All antibodies were used at 1:1,000 dilution, except
h-tubulin (1:10,000).
Kinase inhibitors. Sunitinib was obtained from MGH pharmacy.
Sorafenib and imatinib were purchased from American Custom Chemicals
Corporation. The in vitro kinase specificity profile of all three compounds is
listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) was done as described previously (16). Probes for PDGFRA and
c-KIT were derived from BAC clones RP11-58C6 (PDGFRA) and RP11-977G3
(c-KIT) and purchased from Invitrogen.
DNA sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated using the Gentra
purification system. PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and c-KIT coding sequences were
amplified from genomic DNA by PCR. PCR products were purified and
subjected to bidirectional sequencing by using BigDye v1.1 (Applied
Biosystems) in combination with an ABI3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Primers used for sequencing are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
Electropherograms were analyzed by using Sequence Navigator software
(Applied Biosystems). All mutations were confirmed by at least two
independent PCR amplifications.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were pulsed with 10 Amol/L bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 1 to 2 h before collection, centrifuged, and fixed in icecold 70% ethanol. Cells were washed with PBS/0.5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) and incubated in denaturing solution (2 mol/L HCl) for 20 min at
room temperature. After a further wash with PBS/0.5% BSA, the cells were
resuspended in 0.1 mol/L sodium borate for 2 min at room temperature.
After an additional wash, cells were suspended with anti-BrdUrd
monoclonal antibody for 20 min (1:500; Becton Dickinson). Cells were
washed in PBS/0.5% BSA and the pellet was resuspended in FITCconjugated antimouse IgG (1:50; Vector Laboratories) for 20 min. After an

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

additional wash in PBS/0.5% BSA, cells were stained with 10 Ag/mL
propidium iodide (Sigma) and treated with RNase A (Sigma) before twodimensional fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using CellQuest
software (Becton Dickinson).
SNP and gene expression analyses. Gene copy numbers were
determined as previously described using the GeneChip Human Mapping
250K. The array was then scanned on the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and
analyzed using GTYPE version 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping
Algorithm and the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Set library files
(Mapping 250K_Nsp).
For gene expression studies, RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNA
easy kit (P/N 74106) and amplified and biotin labeled with the Arcturus
RiboAmp RNA Amplification Kit using biotinylated ribonucleotides (PerkinElmer PN Biotin-11-UTP, NEL543001EA/Biotin-11-CTP, NEL542001EA)
during in vitro transcription. Labeled aRNA was hybridized to Affymetric
GeneChip Human X3P (GPL1352) using protocols described within the
Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (PN701021 Rev.
3). Data were acquired using the Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 Scanner with
autoloader and 7G upgrade. GCOS ver 1.4 software was used to run the
scanner and analyze the data. The expression value for each gene was
calculated using Affymetrix GeneChip software and data were analyzed
using dChip software4 (17). Probe sets were filtered using two criteria: (a)
coefficient of variation between 0.5 and 1,000 and (b) P call rate in arrays
z20%.
Quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated and purified from cells using
STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.). cDNA was transcribed from 2 Ag of total RNA using
the AffinityScript Multi Temperature cDNA Synthesis kit (Stratagene).
Quantitative PCR was done using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit
(Qiagen) and with an ABI PRISM 7000 real-time cycler (Applied Biosystems).
Quantification was based on standard curves for each primer set from a
serial dilution of the NCI-H1703 cell line cDNA. All samples were analyzed
in triplicate. Primers sequences were GAPDH F, GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT; GAPDH R, TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG; PDGFRA
F, AAATTGTGTCCACCGTGATCT; PDGFRA R, AGGCCAAAGTCACAGATCTTC; PDGFC F, AACGGAGTACAAGATCCTCAGC; and PDGFC R,
CCATCACTGGGTTCCTCAAC.
RNA interference studies. ShRNAs targeting sequences within the genes
encoding either PDGFRA (n = 10) or its ligand PDGFC (n = 5) were
expressed from the pLKO.1 lentiviral vector (Supplementary Table S3). NCIH1703 and A-204 cells were infected in the presence of polybrene (8 Ag/mL).
A cell line showing sunitinib-insensitivity (A549) was used to determine
infection efficiency based on puromycin resistance and to confirm
specificity. Protein lysates and RNA were collected 48 h postinfection, and
cell numbers were determined 72 h postinfection.
PDGFC neutralizing antibody experiments. Cells were seeded in
1% fetal bovine serum medium and treated the following day with 5 to
20 ng/mL of an anti-PDGFC neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems, Inc.).
Normal goat IgG at 20 ng/mL concentration was used as a control. Cells
were fixed and stained 5 d after treatment, and cell viability was measured
as previously described (15).

Results
Rare human cancer cell lines are sensitive to single-agent
sunitinib treatment. Using an automated platform to examine
drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines (15), we tested the sunitinib
sensitivity of 637 established human cancer cell lines derived from
a wide variety of solid tumor types (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 1).
Cells were treated for 72 hours with 1 Amol/L sunitinib and then
assayed for cytostatic or cytotoxic responses. Whereas the vast
majority of tested cell lines were largely refractory to treatment,
two cell lines (A-204 rhabdomyosarcoma and NCI-H1703 NSCLC)

reduction in cell number (Fig. 1A). We note that cell lines derived
from GISTs, which show clinical sunitinib sensitivity, reflecting
inhibition of mutationally activated PDGFR or c-KIT kinases, were

absent from the panel of tested lines. A few additional lines showed
a relatively weaker response to sunitinib.

tested, significant sunitinib sensitivity was observed only in the
adenosquamous NCI-H1703 line (Fig. 1B). SNP array data available
for 88 of these lines revealed that NCI-H1703 cells harbor focal
PDGFRA gene amplification (Fig. 1B). This was confirmed by
interphase FISH analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2A). There was no
evidence of either c-KIT or PDGFRB genomic amplification or
protein expression in these cells (data not shown). Sequence
analysis of the entire coding sequence of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and
c-KIT in this cell line revealed a single mutation in exon 9 of
PDGFRA (S478P), within the extracellular domain, which would not
be expected to result in PDGFR activation.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

The SNP array data revealed similarly elevated PDGFRA gene
copy number in four other NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H1693, NCIH2085, NCI-H23, and NCI-H661); however, these lines were
sunitinib insensitive (Table 1; Fig. 2A). FISH analyses of these cell
lines confirmed PDGFRA amplification (Supplementary Fig. S3).
However, analysis of the transcriptional expression profile of
tyrosine kinase signaling pathway–associated genes in the 90
NSCLC cell line panel revealed that only NCI-H1703 showed
significant expression of PDGFRA mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Furthermore, when the gene expression profile of NCI-H1703 cells
was compared with the other 89 NSCLC cell lines for the most

significant up-regulated and down-regulated mRNA transcripts, the
most highly expressed mRNA in NCI-H1703 cells corresponded to
PDGFRA ( fold change of 213; Table 2). When we focused on those
probes involved in PDGFR signaling, none of the other four NSCLC
cell lines with increased PDGFRA copy number displayed increased
PDGFRA mRNA expression (Fig. 2B). The observed increase in
PDGFRA mRNA expression in the NCI-H1703 cells was confirmed
by quantitative PCR (Fig. 2C).
Sunitinib dose-response curves for the NCI-H1703 cell line versus
a panel of NSCLC cell lines with normal (Fig. 3A) or increased
PDGFRA gene copy number (Fig. 3B) confirmed the unique
sensitivity in NCI-H1703 cells. Moreover, expression of phosphorylated and total PDGFRA protein was only detected in NCI-H1703
cells (Fig. 3A and B), and PDGFRA protein was not detected in any
of the sunitinib-insensitive cell lines. In fact, when we extended this
panel to include an additional 26 NSCLC sunitinib-insensitive cell
lines, we were unable to detect expression of PDGFRA in any other
lines (Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, the increased transcriptional expression of PDGFRA in NCI-H1703 results in increased
PDGFRA protein and is associated with elevated phosphoPDGFRA, which potentially mediates sensitivity to sunitinib.
To assess PDGFRA amplification in clinical NSCLC cases, we
analyzed 143 NSCLC primary tumor specimens by FISH and
detected 3 of 81 (3.7%) cases of focal PDGFRA amplification in
squamous cell carcinomas (Supplementary Fig. S2B). PDGFRA
amplification was not detected in any of 62 adenocarcinoma cases
analyzed. Thus, focal PDGFRA gene amplification arises at
relatively low frequency in NSCLC and may be more common in
the squamous cell setting.

Inhibition of PDGFRA activation in NCI-H1703 cells disrupts
downstream signaling. Treatment of NCI-H1703 cells with
sunitinib for 6 hours resulted in complete inhibition of PDGFRA
protein phosphorylation as well as that of Akt, a PDGFR effector
(Fig. 3C). Sunitinib had no effect on such signaling in the sunitinibinsensitive cell lines (data not shown). To verify that PDGFRAdependent signaling was indeed the basis for the observed
sunitinib sensitivity of NCI-H1703 cells, we treated the cells with
two additional PDGFRA kinase inhibitors, sorafenib and imatinib.
Both compounds exhibited a similar activity to that of sunitinib
(Fig. 3C), whereas none of the sunitinib-insensitive NSCLC cell
lines displayed sensitivity to either agent (data not shown).
Furthermore, like sunitinib, both compounds suppressed Akt
signaling in NCI-H1703 cells (Fig. 3C). Together, these findings
suggest that the NCI-H1703 NSCLC cells are dependent on
activated PDGFRA signaling.
To investigate the underlying mechanism for the ability of
sunitinib to reduce cell number in NCI-H1703 cells, we examined
PARP cleavage, an indicator of apoptosis, and cell cycle profile.
There was no evidence of PARP cleavage following treatment with
1 Amol/L sunitinib at 24, 48, or 72 hours in this cell line (data not
shown), whereas cell cycle analysis confirmed a significant S-phase
arrest at each of these time points (Supplementary Fig. S6),
consistent with a cytostatic response to drug exposure.
PDGFRA activation is associated with sensitivity to sunitinib
in a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. As described above, in the
initial screen of 637 cell lines for sunitinib sensitivity, a
rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, A-204, was the most highly drugsensitive line detected (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the

observed sensitivity could be extended to other rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, a panel of six additional rhabdomyosarcoma lines
were tested for sunitinib sensitivity (Fig. 4A). Of the tested lines,
only A-204 showed sunitinib sensitivity, and in only this cell line
was PDGFRA protein detectable (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Unlike in NCIH1703 cells, FISH analysis did not reveal PDGFRA gene amplification in any of these lines (Fig. 4B), and DNA sequence analysis of
PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and c-KIT in A-204 cells did not reveal any

mutations. However, as in NCI-H1703 cells, we detected a
substantial (15-fold) increase in PDGFRA mRNA expression in A204 cells (Fig. 2C). Moreover, sunitinib treatment completely
abolished Akt signaling in this line compared with a sunitinibinsensitive rhabdomyosarcoma line (Fig. 4C). In addition, treatment of A-204 cells with sorafenib and imatinib also disrupted Akt
signaling (Fig. 4D) and similarly inhibited proliferation (data not
shown). These results suggest that rare rhabdomyosarcoma cells

are dependent on activated PDGFRA signaling, associated with
increased expression of PDGFRA mRNA.
Amplification of the gene encoding the PDGFRA ligand
PDGFC mediates PDGFRA activation. Gene expression profiles
of 90 NSCLC cell lines using a filtered list of genes involved in
PDGFR signaling revealed that NCI-H1703 was the only line
displaying significant transcriptional up-regulation of PDGFRA
together with the gene encoding one of its ligands, PDGFC
(Fig. 2B). The increased PDGFC mRNA in NCI-H1703 cells (and in
A-204 cells) was confirmed by quantitative PCR (Supplementary
Fig. S7A). Only the NSCLC cell line NCI-H661 (sunitinib insensitive)
showed similarly elevated PDGFC mRNA, but in the absence of
expression of PDGFRA mRNA or protein. Further analysis of SNP
array data from 88 NSCLC lines revealed a unique coamplification
of the PDGFRA (4q12) and PDGFC (4q32) genes on chromosome 4
in NCI-H1703 cells, which was not observed in any of the other cell
lines (Fig. 2A).
ShRNA-mediated knockdown of PDGFRA and PDGFC was used
to directly assess their functional requirement in both the NCIH1703 and A-204 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7B). There was no
effect of these shRNAs on a sunitinib-insensitive cell line (A549)
that lacks PDGFRA expression. In contrast, knockdown of PDGFRA
in NCI-H1703 and A-204 cells significantly reduced proliferation to

a similar extent as sunitinib treatment (Fig. 5A). Furthermore,
knockdown of PDGFC expression also reduced proliferation in
both lines, and the observed decrease was of the same magnitude
seen following sunitinib treatment (Fig. 5A).
We also examined the activity of a neutralizing anti-PDGFC
antibody to confirm the ligand knockdown findings and to assess
the potential therapeutic value of anti-PDGFC antibodies in such
tumor cells. We treated three cell lines (A549, NCI-H1703, and
A-204) with a concentration range of the anti-PDGFC antibody.
Whereas there was no detectable effect on the proliferation of A549
cells, the antibody reduced proliferation in the NCI-H1703 and
A-204 cell lines to a similar extent to that seen following sunitinib
treatment (Fig. 5B). Notably, the effect was observed in A-204 cells
even at the lowest antibody concentration, potentially reflecting
relatively higher PDGFC expression in the NCI-H1703 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7A). Combining sunitinib and the antiPDGFC antibody did not result in any additive inhibitory effects on
these cells (data not shown). ShRNA-mediated depletion of
PDGFRA and PDGFC was used to determine the effect on PDGFRA
activation and downstream signaling in the NCI-H1703 cells
(Fig. 5C). ShRNA-mediated depletion of both receptor and ligand
resulted in decreased PDGFRA phosphorylation and inhibition of
Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Together, these results indicate

dependency on increased PDGFRA and PDGFC expression for
sustained proliferation.

Discussion
Our cancer cell line profiling analysis with the multikinase
inhibitor sunitinib has revealed that drug sensitivity in a
monoculture context is restricted to a small number of lines
exhibiting activated PDGFRA signaling. Moreover, in these cells,
PDGFRA activation is coupled to critical downstream effectors
such as Akt, and disrupting these pathways seems to mediate the
inhibitory effects of sunitinib on proliferation. Previous reports of
PDGFRA activation in cancer have been largely confined to GISTs
(activating PDGFRA mutations) and rare cases of idiopathic
hypereosinophilic syndrome (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion transcripts;
refs. 18, 19). Our findings suggest that in additional rare cases of
NSCLC and sarcoma, PDGFRA activation may be important in
maintaining the malignant phenotype.
The clinical success of sunitinib in renal cancer has been
suggested to reflect its role as a VEGF receptor inhibitor and the
consequent effects on angiogenesis. Notably, renal cancers are
highly vascularized tumors, suggesting a potential critical require-

ment for angiogenesis in that disease setting. However, the ability
of sunitinib to target additional kinases, such as PDGFR, might
contribute to its clinical activity in renal cancer. We note that our
cell line panel included 19 renal cancer cell lines, none of which
showed significant sunitinib sensitivity. This suggests that PDGFR
is not likely to provide a critical dependency signal in renal cancer;
however, a contributing role of PDGFR inhibition in the clinical
activity of sunitinib cannot be excluded. Whereas in a conventional
xenograft model, any observed consequence of drug treatment
on tumor growth could potentially reflect direct effects on tumor
cells as well as effects on the stroma and vasculature, our
monoculture-based platform provides a means to isolate the tumor
cell–autonomous drug response.
In both of the sunitinib-sensitive cancer cell lines identified,
PDGFRA activation seems to be mediated by increased expression
of the receptor as well as one of its ligands, PDGFC. This is in
contrast to other models of receptor tyrosine kinase activation
associated with gene amplification, wherein ligand-independent
activation is typically postulated (20, 21). In NCI-H1703 cells,
activation of the PDGFRA signaling pathways is a consequence of
focal PDGFRA and PDGFC gene coamplification. To our knowledge,
this is the first report in NSCLCs of overexpression of both an
oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand, although

coexpression of the PDGFRA or PDGFRB receptors with their
cognate ligands at higher levels than seen in adjacent normal tissue
has been reported for some gliomas and osteosarcomas (22, 23).
Intriguingly, targeting PDGFC had a greater effect on proliferation
in both sunitinib-sensitive cell lines than targeting PDGFRA. This
raises the possibility that PDGFRA is not the sole critical target of
PDGFC in these cells.
Our findings also suggest that antibodies directed against
PDGFR ligands may have therapeutic potential in PDGFRAdependent cancer. Traditionally, therapeutic antibodies have been
targeted to cell surface receptors implicated in tumor cell
proliferation or maintenance, rather than against their cognate
ligands (24). Such antibodies typically show a more favorable
toxicity profile than small-molecule kinase inhibitors, and when
considered in the context of significant toxicities associated with
sunitinib, our findings suggest potential clinical advantages of
antibody-mediated targeting of the PDGFC ligand in some cancers.
Our observation that the PDGFRA gene amplification in the NCIH1703 adenosquamous NSCLC cell line was also seen in a subset of
squamous cell NSCLC clinical samples but in none of the
adenocarcinoma samples screened by FISH raises the possibility
that this represents an oncogenic mechanism unique to this
histologic subtype. In agreement with our findings, Rikova and
colleagues (13) detected PDGFRA activation using a phosphoproteomic screen in eight NSCLC patient samples as well as in the
NCI-H1703 cell line. Whereas NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients are
being actively recruited into clinical trials of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (in the setting of
activating EGFR mutations) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase
inhibitors (ALK translocations), to date, no drug-sensitizing
genotypes have been identified for squamous cell NSCLC patients
(25, 26). It remains to be seen whether retrospective analyses of
sunitinib-responsive NSCLC patients will reveal enrichment for
PDGFRA gene amplification or expression, and whether such
patients’ tumors show squamous histology.
Curiously, PDGFRA expression was only detected in the NCIH1703 NSCLC cells, despite the fact that four other cell lines
showed increased PDGFRA gene copy number. Thus, focal
amplification of the PDGFRA gene may uniquely yield high level
PDGFR expression, potentially reflecting an additional genomic
alteration within this locus that influences the regulatory regions of

PDGFRA gene transcription. Similarly, it remains unclear as to the
molecular mechanism underlying increased PDGFRA or PDGFC
mRNA expression in the A-204 cells. Sarcomas often harbor
chromosomal translocations giving rise to oncogenic activation,
and these can affect PDGFR signaling. For example, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and giant cell fibroblastomas harbor
chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 and 22, in
which the collagen type Ia1 (COLIA1) gene undergoes fusion with
the gene encoding PDGFB (27). In one study of 42 cases of uterine
sarcoma, 70% of tumors displayed increased PDGFRA expression
compared with that seen in adjacent normal tissue (28). Likewise,
in a study of 54 osteosarcoma patients, increased PDGFRA and
PDGFRB expression was observed in tumors in more than 75%
of cases (29). Notably, most Ewing sarcomas are associated with
a gene fusion that produces a transcription factor (EWS/FLI-1)
that promotes PDGFC mRNA expression (30). However, imatinib
therapy in this setting shows minimal clinical activity (31). In these
tumors, which are notoriously refractory to chemotherapy,
targeting PDGFR signaling pathways may provide a useful
alternative therapy.
In summary, our findings show that ligand-mediated activation
of PDGFRA signaling may be a critical mediator of cell proliferation
in a small subset of NSCLCs and rhabdomyosarcomas and may
sensitize these cancer cells to either selective small-molecule
PDGFR kinase inhibitors or ligand-neutralizing antibodies. Our
findings suggest that sunitinib as well as other PDGFR kinase
inhibitors may provide genotype-associated clinical benefit beyond
the setting of PDGFR-mutant or c-KIT-mutant GISTs.
