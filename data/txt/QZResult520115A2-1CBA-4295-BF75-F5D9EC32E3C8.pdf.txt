ABSTRACT
As a natural health supplement, 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM) is proposed as a
preventive and chemotherapeutic agent for cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation and
inducing cell apoptosis. However, we found that in contrary to high level of DIM (30
μM), low level of DIM (1 μM and 10 μM) obviously promoted gastric cancer cell growth
and migration. In addition, we found that low level of DIM increased the expression of
stemness factors and enhanced the pluripotency of gastric cancer cells. Low level of
DIM promoted gastric cancer progression by inducing the PORCN-dependent secretion
of Wnt4 and the activation of β-catenin signaling. Wnt4 knockdown reversed the
effects of low level of DIM on gastric cancer cells. The results of in vivo studies
showed that gastric cancer cells treated with low level of DIM (1 μM) grew faster
and expressed higher level of Wnt4 than control cells. Taken together, our findings
indicate that low level of DIM activates autocrine Wnt4 signaling to enhance the
progression of gastric cancer, which may suggest an adverse aspect of DIM in cancer
therapy. Our findings will provide a new aspect for the safety of DIM in its clinical
application.

INTRODUCTION

has anticancer effects in various cancer cells in vitro and in
vivo. DIM induces a G1 cell cycle arrest in breast, prostate,
colon, and esophageal cancer cells [11-15]. DIM inhibits
cell proliferation and induces cell apoptosis in cancer cells
[7, 16-18]. Moreover, DIM could suppress tumor growth
by inhibiting angiogenesis [19, 20]. Interestingly, low
level of DIM could activate estrogen receptor α and induce
the proliferation of breast cancer cells in the absence of
estradiol [21]. The above mentioned studies indicate that
DIM at certain doses could effectively inhibit cancer
progression. However, the effects of low level of DIM on
cancer remain largely unknown.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are known to be resistant
to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which
could promote tumor growth through self-renewal and
differentiation [3, 22-25]. Recently, many studies have
shown that small molecule drugs could promote cell

Gastric cancer is one of the most lethal cancers
in Asia and the second leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide [1-3]. Chemotherapy is one of the
primary treatments for gastric cancer. Although many
new anticancer drugs and chemotherapies have been
introduced, there has been no significant progress in the
treatment effect. The main reason is that gastric cancer
cells can develop multidrug resistance to chemotherapeutic
drugs, which significantly limits the application of
chemotherapy drugs [4, 5]. The natural indoles DIM is a
small molecule compound and an major active metabolite
of indole-3-carbinol, which is also a natural health
supplement as well as a naturally-occurring compound in
cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts,
and cabbage [6-10]. Many studies have shown that DIM

reprogramming and stemness [26-27, 29]. Small molecules
have positive impacts on stem cell biology, from the
maintenance of pluripotency, the promotion of single cell
survival and steering differentiation to involvement in
reprogramming somatic cells [26]. Pluripotent stem cells
can be generated from mouse somatic cells at a frequency
up to 0.2% using a combination of seven small-molecule
compounds [27]. The previous study has suggested a
new approach to regulate somatic cell reprogramming by
targeting chromatin de-condensation with small molecules
[28]. Primordial germ cells can be reprogrammed into
pluripotent state using small molecule compounds [29].
The chemotherapeutic agents could induce the enrichment
of CSCs in several types of cancer. However, the effects
of DIM, the small molecule compound, on the stemness of
gastric cancer cells are not well characterized.
In this study, we investigated the effects of low level
of DIM on gastric cancer cells and explored the underlying
molecular mechanisms. We found that low level of DIM
(1 μM and 10 μM) could obviously promote gastric cancer
cell proliferation, migration, and stemness through the
activation of autocrine Wnt4/β-catenin signaling.

control group (Figure 1D, 1E). The transwell migration
assay was also used to determine the role of low level of
DIM in gastric cancer cell motility. Compared with the
control group, 1μM and 10μM DIM markedly increased
the number of migrated HGC-27 cells (Figure 1F). The
similar results were also obtained in the other gastric
cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 2A-2D). The results
of western blot showed that treatment with 1 μM and 10
μM DIM inhibited the expression of epithelial cell marker
E-cadherin and increased the expression of mesenchymal
cell markers N-cadherin and Vimentin in HGC-27 cells
(Figure 1G). The results of immunofluorescent staining
also confirmed the increase of N-cadherin and the decrease
of E-cadherin by 1μM and 10 μM DIM in HGC-27 cells
(Figure 1H). In summary, these data suggests that low
level of DIM enhances the migratory ability of gastric
cancer cells.

Low level of DIM enhances the stemness of gastric
cancer cells
Increasing evidence suggests that cell proliferation
and EMT phenotype are closely related to cell stemness
[30, 31]. Since low level of DIM obviously enhanced
gastric cancer cell growth and migration, we wanted to
know whether cell stemness and pluripotency are involved
in these changes. We first examined the expression of stem
cell markers in HGC-27 cells treated with low level of
DIM for 48h. The results of quantitative RT-PCR showed
that the expression of Oct4, SALL4, and Sox2 genes was
significantly up-regulated in HGC-27 cells treated with 1
μM and 10 μM DIM for 48 h (Figure 2A). The results of
western blot showed that the expression of CD44, SALL4,
c-MYC, Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 proteins also increased
in 1 μM and 10 μM DIM-treated gastric cancer cells
(Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 3A, 3C, 3E, 3F, 3G). In
addition, we confirmed the increased expression of CD44
and Sox2 in HGC-27 cells treated with low level of DIM
by using immunofluorescent staining (Figure 2C). We next
determined the differentiation potential of HGC-27 cells
treated with low level of DIM. The results showed that
HGC-27 cells treated with 1 μM and 10 μM DIM could be
more efficiently induced to differentiate into adipocytes in
the appropriate conditioned medium (Figure 2D). In brief,
low level of DIM could enhance the stemness of gastric
cancer cells.

RESULTS
Low level of DIM promotes the proliferation and
migration of gastric cancer cells
To determine the effects of various levels of DIM
on human gastric cancer cell growth, we analyzed the
colony formation abilities of six gastric cancer cell lines
(including HGC-27, MGC-803, SGC-7901, AGS, MKN45, and BGC-823) which were treated with different
concentrations of DIM (ranging from 1 μM to 30 μM) for
10 days. The results showed that 30 μM DIM significantly
inhibited the formation of colonies in all the tested gastric
cancer cell lines. In contrary, 1 μM and 10 μM DIM
dramatically enhanced the colony formation abilities
of all the tested gastric cancer cell lines (Figure 1A,
Supplementary Figure 1A, 1C, 1E, 1G, 1J). Additionally,
1 μM and 10 μM DIM increased the expression of cell
proliferation related proteins PCNA and Cyclin-D3
(Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1B, 1D, 1F, 1H, and
1K). Moreover, the results of cell counting assay showed
that treatment with 1 μM and 10 μM DIM promoted
the proliferation of HGC-27 cells at 48 h and 72 h after
seeding while treatment with 30 μM DIM had the opposite
effect (Figure 1C). Taken together, these results suggest
that low level of DIM promotes the proliferation of gastric
cancer cells.
We next determined the effect of low level of DIM
on the migration of gastric cancer cells. The results of
wound healing assay showed that 1 μM and 10 μM DIM
promoted the migration of HGC-27 cells compared to the

Low level of DIM activates Wnt/β-catenin
signaling to promote gastric cancer progression
The previous studies indicate that the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway is a key regulator of cell survival, proliferation,
migration, and stemness [3, 32-34]. We found that low
level of DIM induced the expression of WNT2, WNT4,
WNT5a, WNT6, WNT10b, and WNT11 in HGC-27

cells. We focused on WNT4 in the following studies as it
showed the most significant change (Figure 3A). To test
whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in the effects
of low level of DIM on gastric cancer cells, we detected
the protein levels of β-catenin in HGC-27 cells treated with
low level of DIM by using western blot. We found that the
expression of β-catenin and its downstream targets CD44,
c-MYC, and Cyclin-D3 were significantly up-regulated
in gastric cancer cells after treatment with low level of
DIM (Figures 3B). The activation of β-catenin by low
level of DIM was also confirmed in MGC-803 and SGC7901 cells (Supplementary Figure 3B and 3D). The results

of immunofluorescent staining showed that low level of
DIM obviously induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin
in HGC-27 cells (Figure 3C). ICG001, an inhibitor of
β-catenin, remarkably reversed the up-regulation of
CD44, c-MYC, Nanog, Sox2, PCNA, SALL4, Oct4, and
Cyclin-D3 induced by low level of DIM (Figure 3D). In
addition, we found that low level of DIM-induced colony
formation and adipogenic differentiation of gastric cancer
cells were also reversed by ICG001 (Figures 3E and 3F).
Taken together, these results suggest that low level of
DIM promotes gastric cancer progression through Wnt/βcatenin signaling.

increased after incubation with the conditioned medium
from low level of DIM-treated HGC-27 cells. We further
analyzed the activation of β-catenin by using TOP/FOP
flash reporter assay. We found that low level of DIM
enhanced TOP/FOP flash luciferase reporter activity in
HEK293T cells (Figure 4C). The disruption of PORCN

impairs the processing and secretion of Wnt proteins
[36-38]. Compared to GFP shRNA, PORCN shRNA
significantly inhibited the expression of PORCN in HGC27 cells (Figure 4D). The expression of Wnt4 was also
decreased in shPORCN-HGC-27 cells (Figure 4E). The
results of colony formation assay showed that low level

of DIM accelerated the growth of shGFP-HGC-27 cells
while this change was not observed in shPORCN-HGC-27
cells (Figure 4F). The results of western blot showed that
the up-regulation of PCNA, N-cadherin, stemness factors
(SALL4, Oct4, Nanog, Sox2), Wnt4, β-catenin, and its
downstream targets (CD44, c-MYC, and Cyclin-D3) by
1 μM DIM was reversed by PORCN knockdown (Figure
4G). Moreover, the results of immunofluorescent staining
confirmed that 1 μM DIM treatment obviously increased
the expression of CD44 in shGFP-HGC-27 cells but not
in shPORCN-HGC-27 cells (Supplementary Figure 4A).
We also observed that 1 μM DIM efficiently induced
shGFP-HGC-27 cells to differentiate into adipocytes in
the appropriate conditioned medium while had minimal

effect on the differentiation potential of HGC-27 cells
with PORCN knockdown (Supplementary Figure 4B).
In summary, these results indicate that low level of DIM
activates β-catenin signaling to promote gastric cancer
progression via the autocrine of Wnt.

We next wanted to know whether the induction of
Wnt4 by low level of DIM is critical for the activation of
β-catenin in HGC-27 cells. We found that the expression
of Wnt4 protein was increased in the gastric cancer

cells treated with low level of DIM by using western
blot (Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure 3B and 3D) and
immunofluorescent staining (Figure 5B). To confirm
these results, we collected the conditioned medium from
HGC-27 cells treated with low level of DIM and detected
Wnt4 protein levels by using ELISA. The results showed
that the expression of Wnt4 was higher in HGC-27 cells
treated with low level of DIM for 48 h than that in control
cells (Figure 5C). We knocked down the expression of
WNT4 in HGC-27 cells by using shRNA (shWNT4HGC-27) (Figures 5D and 5E). The expression of PCNA,

Cyclin-D3, CD44, SALL4, Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2
was decreased in shWNT4-HGC-27 cells (Figure 5F).
The induced expression of PCNA, Cyclin-D3, SALL4,
CD44, Oct4, and Sox2 in HGC-27 cells by low level of
DIM was reversed by WNT4 knockdown (Figure 5G).
The knockdown of WNT4 also inhibited the induced
differentiation ability of HGC-27 by low level of DIM
(Figure 5H). Taken together, these results suggest that
low level of DIM promotes gastric cancer progression via
Wnt4 autocrine.

Low level of DIM promotes gastric tumorigenesis
in vivo

promote the reprogramming of mouse somatic cells
into pluripotent stem-like cells [27, 43]. Somatic cells
can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) by overexpression of four transcription factors,
Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-MYC [44]. In our study, the
expression of transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, c-MYC,
Nanog and SALL4 as well as the ability to differentiate
into adipocytes in gastric cancer cells were enhanced by
low level of DIM, suggesting that low level of DIM may
affect gastric cancer cell reprogramming.
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls embryogenesis
and its deregulation is related to tumorigenesis [45-47].
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway critically regulates cell
proliferation and apoptosis [3, 32-34]. We found that low
level of DIM activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling to enhance
gastric cancer cell proliferation and migration. The Wnt/βcatenin signaling is one of the key oncogenic pathways
in cancer and targeting this pathway is an attractive
therapeutic approach [3, 32]. PORCN is a membranebound O-acyltransferase that is required for palmitoylation
of Wnt ligands, a necessary step in the processing of Wnt
ligand secretion [36-38]. Liu et al. suggest that targeting
PORCN potently inhibits Wnt signaling [36]. Moreover,
PORCN dysfunction produces an ‘‘all-WNT’’ mutant
phenotype [37]. These findings provide evidence that
PORCN is extremely necessary to Wnts autorcine. The
interference with PORCN expression reversed low level
of DIM-induced gastric cancer progression, indicating that
the autorcine of active Wnt is essential for this process.
Wnt4 is a member of gene family encoding secreted
signal protein that participate in carcinogenesis [48].
The up-regulation of Wnt4 is observed in gastric cancer
[49]. Wnt4 regulates the proliferation of breast cancer
stem cells in response to progesterone [48]. We found
that the expression of Wnt4 was obviously increased
in gastric cancer cells treated with low level of DIM.
The promoting effects of low level of DIM on gastric
cancer cells are dependent on Wnt4 secretion. Clevers
et al. suggest that Wnt molecules transmit downstream
signals mainly through extracellular receptor [35]. Luga
et al. demonstrate that fibroblast-secreted exosomes
play a key role in promoting breast cancer cell motility
and metastasis by mobilizing autocrine Wnt-planar cell
polarity signaling [50]. The SP cells in lymphoma export
Wnt3a via exosomes to neighboring cells, thus modulating
population equilibrium [34]. We have previously shown
that exosomes deliver Wnt4 protein from stem cells to
skin cells [51, 52], indicating that the low level of DIMinduced Wnt4 protein may be released in exosome form.
The findings of our study may have several
implications for the use of DIM as a dietary supplement or
as a therapeutic agent. As the blood concentrations of DIM
are different in individual patients, it is therefore needed to
determine the pharmacokinetic background of the patients
in metabolizing DIM to ensure therapeutic safety. In
addition, since the low levels of DIM are more achievable

To confirm the in vitro results, SGC-7901 cells
treated with or without 1 μM DIM were used to establish
mouse xenograft tumor models. Representative images
of the tumor bearing mice were shown in Figure 6A.
The tumors in 1 μM DIM treatment group grew faster
and their weight was higher than that in control group
(Figures 6B and 6C). The similar results were also
observed in MGC-803 cells (Supplementary Figure 5A5C). Compared with the control group, the expression of
Snail and N-cadherin was increased in tumors of 1 μM
DIM treatment group (Figures 6D and 6E). The expression
of Wnt4 and β-catenin in tumor tissues was determined
by using immunohistochemistry. We found that Wnt4 and
β-catenin protein levels were higher in 1 μM DIM group
than that in control group (Figure 6F). The increased
expression of PCNA, Wnt4, β-catenin, and CD44 in 1μM
DIM group was also observed (Supplementary Figure 5D).
Taken together, these results suggest that low level of DIM
enhances gastric cancer growth in vivo.

DISCUSSION
DIM has been proposed as a cancer preventive agent
that can be given safely in oral form in repeated doses to
rodents and humans [6, 39-40]. The recent reports have
shown that DIM could inhibit cell proliferation and induce
cell apoptosis in many cancers. DIM inhibits cell growth
and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer partially through
the regulation of Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3/β-catenin/AR
signaling axis [16, 17]. Several reports have also shown
that DIM reduces the activity of nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) in the prostate and breast cancer cells [41, 42]. DIM
suppresses the growth of gastric cancer cells via activation
of the Hippo signaling pathway [18]. DIM could strongly
inhibit angiogenesis and the growth of transplantable
human breast carcinoma in athymic mice [19]. In these
studies, a relatively high level of DIM was used. In our
work, we explored the effect of low level of DIM on
gastric cancer cells and the underlying mechanism. We
found that different concentrations of DIM could lead to
opposite biological outcomes in gastric cancer. Although
30 μM DIM evidently inhibited gastric cancer cell growth,
1 μM and 10 μM DIM obviously promoted gastric cancer
cell proliferation and migration.
Small molecules are more permeable, nonimmunogenic, cost-effective, more easily synthesized,
preserved, and standardized. Moreover, their effects on
inhibiting and activating the function of specific proteins
are often reversible and can be finely tuned by varying
the concentrations [27]. Small molecule compounds have
been found extremely useful to improve the generation
of iPSCs [28]. A combination of small molecules can

than high levels during treatment, the use of DIM should
be undertaken very cautiously. Moreover, as demonstrated
in this study, the activation of Wnt4 signaling is required
by low level of DIM in promoting gastric cancer
progression, probably simultaneous targeting Wnt4 may
help improve therapeutic efficacy.
In summary, we demonstrate in this study that low
level of DIM promotes gastric cancer progression through
Wnt4 autocrine and the activation of β-catenin pathway.
Our findings not only provide new evidence for gastric
cancer progression driven by Wnt/β-catenin signaling but
also suggest the adverse aspect of DIM in cancer therapy.

for 12 h, the cells remaining at the upper surface of the
membrane were removed with a cotton swab. The cells
that migrated through the 8-μm sized pores and adhered

4% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet and
photographed.

Wound healing assay
Cell motility was assessed by an in vitro wound
healing assay. 2Χ105 cells were seeded into six-well plate
and cultured in DMEM to reach confluence. A scrape was
made in the center of the cell monolayers with a sterile
pipette tip to create a gap of constant width. Cellular
debris was removed by gently washing with PBS. The
initial images of the wounds were captured under phase
contrast microscopy and the wounded monolayers were
incubated further at 12 h and 24 h after the treatment
with fresh DMEM medium in the presence of DMSO
or DIM (1 μM or 10 μM). Pictures were taken with a
Nikon eclipse Ti-S microscope at a 100Χ magnification.
To quantify the cell migration index, photographs of the
initial wounded monolayers were compared with the
corresponding images of cells at the end of the incubation.
Artificial lines fitting the cutting edges were drawn on
pictures of the original wounds and overlaid on the images
of cultures after incubation. Cells that migrated across the
lines that were the distance of cells moved were counted.
All quantification was done on full-size images with the
weight of artificial lines negligible, when compared with
the size of the cell body. At least five fields from each
triplicate treatment were counted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was approved by the ethical committee of
Jiangsu University (2012258).

Cell lines and cell culture
Human gastric cancer cell lines HGC-27, SGC7901, and MGC-803 were purchased from the Institute of
Biochemistry and Cell Biology at the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, China). HGC-27, SGC-7901,
and MGC-803 cells were propagated in high-glucose
DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, USA). All the media were
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco).
Cells were cultured at 37oCin humidified air with 5% CO2.

Colony formation assay
Cells were harvested and seeded into 35-mm plates
(1000 cells/well) overnight under standard conditions.
Cells were then treated with various doses of DIM (0μM,
1μM , 10μM, 30μM) and incubated at 37oC in a 5% CO2
humidified incubator for 10 days. The medium containing
various levels of DIM was changed at 3-days interval. At
the end of the incubation period, the cultures were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet.

Western blot
Gastric cancer cells were homogenized and lysed
in RIPA buffer supplemented with proteinase inhibitors.
Equal amount of proteins were loaded and separated on a
12% SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis) gel. Following electrophoresis, the
proteins were transferred to a PVDF (polyvinylidene
difluoride) membrane, blocked in 5% (w/v) non-fat milk
and incubated with the primary antibodies. The sources
of primary antibodies were: β-catenin and E-cadherin
(Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA); SALL4
and N-cadherin (Abcam, USA); Sox2 (Milipore, USA);
Wnt4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA);
CD44, PCNA, and Cyclin D3 ( Bioworld Technology,
Louis Park, MN, USA); Oct4 and Nanog (SAB, USA);
Vimentin (Signalway Antibody, USA); GAPDH, Goat
anti rabbit IgG (HRP), and Goat anti mouse IgG(HRP)
(CWBIO).

Cell counting
Cells were seeded into 24-well plate (4000 cells/
well). After 24 h of incubation under standard conditions,
the cells were treated with the indicated doses of DIM
(0μM, 1μM, 10μM, 30μM). The cells were collected and
counted at the indicated time points (24 h, 48 h, 72 h).
Fold change of cell number was calculated.

Transwell migration assay
Cells (1Χ105/well) were plated into the top chamber
and 10% FBS containing medium was placed into the
bottom chamber. After incubation at 37oC in 5% CO2

RNA extraction, RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR

ELISA for Wnt4 detection

Total RNA was extracted from cells and tissues
using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and equal
amount of RNA was used for RT-PCR and real-time RTPCR analyses. β-actin was used as the internal control. The
sequences of specific primers are listed in Supplementary
Table 1.

HGC-27 cells were treated with low level of
DIM for 48 h, then washed with PBS twice, cultivated
in the normal high-glucose DMEM culture medium for
48 h, finally the conditioned medium were collected
from HGC-27 cells. Wnt4 concentration in cell culture
supernatant was measured by using a commercial ELISA
Kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction(Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The absolute
amount of Wnt4 protein was calculated based on standard
curves using human recombinant Wnt4 as the standard
material. The concentration of Wnt4 was expressed as
pictograms per milliliter.

Immunofluorescence
Cells cultured in 24-well chamber slides were
treated for 48 h with various concentrations of DIM
and then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20
min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton Χ-100 for 10 min,
blocked with 5% BSA, incubated with the indicated
primary antibodies at 4oC overnight and followed by a
Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit (CD44, Sox2, Wnt4, β-catenin,
and E-cadherin) or anti-mouse (N-cadherin) secondary
antibody. The cells were then stained with Hoechst33342
for nuclear staining for 5 min, and the images were
acquired with a Nikon eclipse Ti-S microscope.

Lentiviral knockdown of PORCN and WNT4 in
HGC-27
The lentiviral expression vector containing the
PORCN or WNT4 shRNA sequence (sigma) was selected
for specifically targeting PORCN and WNT4, which
was classified as LentiPORCN-shRNA, LentiWNT4shRNA, and LentiGFP-shRNA as negative control
vector. The PORCN and WNT4 shRNA lentivirus
vectors were generated by ligating the vector Tet-pLKOpuro. PORCN shRNA oligonucleotide sequences are:
Forward,5’-CCGGCCTTCCACTTCAGCAACTATTC
TCGAGAAT AGTTGCTGAAGTGGAAGGTTTTTTG
- 3’; Reverse,5’-AATTCAAAAACCTTCCACTTCAG
CAACTATTCTCGAGAATAGTTGCTGAAGTGGAA

was produced by co-transfecting HEK293T cells
with PLKO-GFP-shRNA or PLKO PORCN-shRNA,
PLKO-WNT4-shRNA, PU1562 and PU1563 plasmid
by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The viruscontaining supernatant was harvested at 48h and 72h
post-transfection. HGC-27 cells were transduced with the
prepared lentivirus (LentiWNT4-shRNA or Lenti-GFPshRNA). Stable cell lines were obtained after selection
with 1 μg/mL of puromycin (Invitrogen) for 15 days. The
expression of shRNA was induced by addition of 80 μg/
mL doxycycline. The efficiency of WNT4 knockdown
was evaluated by using real-time quantitative RT-PCR
and western blot.

Adipogenic differentiation
1Χ105 cells were seeded in six-well plate and
cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24h and transferred
to the medium with different concentrations of DIM
for 48 h. The cells were then changed to adipogenic
differentiation medium for 1 week according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (GUXMX-90031, Cyagen
Biosciences, CA, USA). At the end of induction, the
adipogenic potential was identified by oil red O staining.

Wnt reporter activity assay
For the luciferase reporter assay, HEK293T
cells were co-transfected with TOP-Flash or FOPFlash luciferase reporter. Transfection efficiency was
normalized by cotransfection with a β-actin Renilla
reporter containing a Renilla luciferase gene under the
control of a human β-actin promoter. The activities of
firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase were quantified by
the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). At 6
hours after transfection, HEK293T cells were incubated
with equal amounts of conditioned medium from HGC-27
cells treated with indicated concentration of DIM for 48
h. Wnt reporter activity was determined by dual luciferase
reporter assay.

Animals were sacrificed approximately 2
weeks after tumor formation, and the tumors were
harvested. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and
immunohistochemistry were performed on 5μm serial
coronal sections from paraffin-embedded tumors. Tissue
sections were de-waxed in xylene and rehydrated in
graded alcohol, after which endogenous peroxidase
activity was quenched by incubating the sections in 0.3%
(v/v) hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Antigen-retrieval
was performed by incubating the sections in citrate buffer
(pH 6.0). Non-specific binding was blocked by 5% bovine
serum albumin, and tissue sections were incubated with
antibodies against human Wnt4 and β-catenin according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Boster Bioengineering
Company Limited, Wuhan, China). Anti-Wnt4 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) 1:50; antiβ-catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA,
USA) 1:50; were used as primary antibody. Finally, the
slices were mounted with neutral gum for microscopic
examination, and cells with brown granules in the
cytoplasm or nucleolus were considered positive. Images
were collected using a Nikon eclipse Ti-S microscope at a
200Χ magnification.
