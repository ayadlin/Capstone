Systemic Therapy of Inflammatory Breast
Cancer From High-Dose Chemotherapy to
Targeted Therapies*
The French Experience*

BACKGROUND: Aggressiveness of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is related to its metastatic potential. The introduction of primary chemotherapy in the multimodality treatment has dramatically changed the prognosis. However,
survival remains poor. Since 1995, innovative systemic therapies have been assessed in France in multicentric clinical
trials, initially centered on high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and,
more recently, on targeted therapies. METHODS: The authors present the rationale and first results of these French
studies specifically dedicated to nonmetastastic IBC. RESULTS: More than 380 patients have been included in 5 trials.
The first 3 trials enrolled 329 women and concerned HDC (PEGASE 02, 05, 07). PEGASE 02 and PEGASE 05 showed
a high pathological complete response rate (30%) after primary sequential HDC, and suggested that more than 4
cycles does not seem to provide any benefit. PEGASE 07 tested adjuvant maintenance chemotherapy after neoadjuvant HDC. Analysis is ongoing. The 2 other trials currently underway combine targeted therapies with conventionaldose chemotherapy in ERBB2-negative (Beverly 1 trial; bevacizumab) and ERBB2-positive (Beverly 2; bevacizumab
and trastuzumab) IBC. CONCLUSIONS: HDC with HSCT remains experimental with high pCR rates and which likely
benefits to subgroups of patients that remain to be identified. Targeted therapies, such as anti-ERBB2 and antiangiogenic drugs, are being tested, and should improve survival as demonstrated in non-IBC. With emerging targeted
drugs, there is hope that a cure becomes an achievable goal for more patients. Because of the rarity and the heterogeneity of disease, well-designed large-scale collaborative studies are mandatory. Cancer 2010;116(11 suppl):2829–36.

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare (  5% of cases) but aggressive form of breast cancer. Conversely to

that of non-IBC, its incidence rose during the 1990s.1 Aggressiveness of disease is related to its rapid progression and its
metastatic potential, highlighted by the high incidence of axillary lymph node involvement and distant metastases (35%)
at time of diagnosis, and by the very low rate of long-term survival (<5%) when patients were historically treated with
locoregional treatment alone. The introduction of primary combination chemotherapy in the multimodality treatment
has dramatically changed the prognosis.2 However, and despite this progress, there has not been an important change in
the survival of IBC patients in the last 30 years,3 with a 5-year survival remaining between 30 and 50%.4,5
Improvement of the systemic treatment is a crucial objective. Because of the relative infrequency of the disease, its
rapid progression, and its poor prognosis, a few clinical IBC-specific trials are available; IBC patients generally being enrolled in trials including locally advanced breast cancers. No phase 3 study exclusively dedicated to IBC patients has been
published or performed and most of the current systemic regimens have been extrapolated from those used in non-IBC
and from registries or retrospective noncontrolled studies. Until recently, anthracycline-based combination was the standard regimen of primary chemotherapy.5-8 Then, taxanes were introduced with some benefit in terms of response,

progression-free survival, and overall survival, notably for
patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumor,9,10 making the taxane-anthracycline combination the current
standard. But results are not sufficient, calling for the
urgent optimization of neoadjuvant systemic treatments.
Reported prognostic features11 remain contested. However, response to conventional chemotherapy—notably
pathological response—seems to be a strong indicator of
long-term survival,2,9,12-14 furthermore highlighting the
importance of the neoadjuvant systemic treatment.
Since 1995, innovative systemic therapeutic
approaches have been assessed in France in the context of
multicentric trials, first centered on high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and
more recently on molecularly targeted therapies. Here, we
present the rationale and the results of these national
studies.

HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY WITH
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL
TRANSPLANTATION
High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was tested in the early
1990s in poor-prognosis breast cancer including IBC.
The rationale included the disappointing results of conventional chemotherapy, the chemosensitivity of disease,
the dose-response, and dose-intensity relationships demonstrated with alkylating agents.15,16 In IBC, additional
rationale came from the importance of initial response to
primary chemotherapy, and the increase of pathological
response rates by using semi-intensive chemotherapy
without HSCT.8,17
Publications about alkylating agent-based HDC
with HSCT in IBC are rare. Initial data came from the
International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry,18 and
since 1997, from some pilot or phase 2 studies, where
HDC was delivered as consolidation after conventional
chemotherapy and then surgery, in most of cases.19-25
Globally, even if it was difficult to compare these studies,
often multicentric and/or with small cohorts, with heterogeneous treatments and limited follow-up (median
approximately 47 months), the 3-year or 4-year diseasefree survival (DFS) rates (from 45 to 65%) and overall
survival (OS) rates (from 52 to 89%) were similar to each
other and were in the upper range of historical cohorts of
IBC patients treated with conventional chemotherapy.
More recently, Somlo et al reported on a large series of
120 women with IBC who were treated on sequentially

2830

developed single-cycle or tandem-cycle HDC trials after
primary conventional-dose chemotherapy and surgery.26
With a median follow-up of 61 months, estimated 5-year
relapse-free survival and OS were 44% and 64%, respectively. Positive prognostic markers were positive estrogen
receptor status, low number of involved axillary lymph
nodes, and tandem HDC. We retrospectively analyzed a
series of 74 consecutive cases of nonmetastatic IBC treated
in our institution with induction anthracycline-based
chemotherapy.27 Several parameters including intensity
of chemotherapy (20 patients with conventional doses
and 54 with HDC and HSCT), pathological features and
immunohistochemistry were evaluated for a potential
prognostic role. With a median follow-up of 48 months
after diagnosis, the 5-year projected DFS was 24% and
OS 41%. In multivariate analysis, the strongest prognostic
factor was the delivery of HDC. The 5-year DFS and OS
of patients were, respectively 28% and 50% with HDC
and 15% and 18% with conventional chemotherapy.
Many of these pilot studies had shown a potential
benefit for HDC with HSCT in the treatment of IBC.
But, like for non-IBC, the debate was confusing within
the oncologists regarding the actual benefit. In the middle
1990s, consensus conferences concluded on the requirement of randomized studies larger enough to detect survival differences between 10 and 20%. In 1994, the
French Federation of Cancer Centers (Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer) and the
French Bone Marrow Society (Société Française de Greffe
de Moëlle) merged their efforts to create the PEGASE
Group. The objective was to perform larger and multicentric randomized comparative studies of HDC with HSCT
in poor-prognosis breast cancer. In nonmetastatic IBC, 3
trials were successively conducted between January 1995
and June 2005 and enrolled 329 patients: 2 phase 2 trials
(PEGASE 02 and PEGASE 05) and a phase 3 trial
(PEGASE 07).
PEGASE 02 trial was conducted between January
1995 and September 1996 through 17 anticancer centers
in France and accrued 100 patients. The primary endpoint was the rate of pathological complete response
(pCR) obtained after sequential HDC combining cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (D), and 5-fluorouracil
(5FU). At diagnosis, patients received 4 cycles of chemotherapy every 3 weeks associating C 6 g/m2 and D 75 mg/
m2 at cycle 1, C 3 g/m2 and D 75 mg/m2 at cycle 2, C 3 g/
m2, D 75 mg/m2 and 5FU 2500 mg/m2 at cycles 3 and 4.
G-CSF was administered after each cycle. Hematopoietic
stem cells (HSC) were harvested after cycle(s) 1 þ /-2, and

reinfused on Day 7 of cycles 3 and 4. Mastectomy with
second axillary dissection (if not performed initially) was
performed after HDC, followed by radiotherapy. Tamoxifen was then given to menopausal patients with hormone
receptor-positive tumor. Ninety-five patients were eligible. They received 366 cycles of chemotherapy. Eightyseven women completed the planned treatment. The relative dose-intensity was 0.97 for C and 0.96 for D. The
most frequent nonhematological toxicity was vomiting
and the most frequent hematological toxicity was febrile
neutropenia. One patient died from septic shock during
neutropenia after cycle 1. Eighty-six patients underwent
mastectomy, which was performed in a median of 3.5
months after the first cycle of HDC. The pCR rate was
32%, encouraging when compared with the rate observed
after standard chemotherapy.28 With a 3-year median follow-up, the 3-year DFS rate was 44% and OS 70%. This
study confirmed the feasibility of sequential HDC with
HSCT in IBC, and revealed interesting rates of pCR and
3-year survival. Two specific studies on quality of life29
and economic assessment30 further confirmed the
feasibility of the approach. We are now analyzing the
survival results with an extended follow-up and the
prognostic value of molecular features assessed by
immunohistochemistry.
The following phase 2 trial (PEGASE 05) was initiated on August 1997. Like in PEGASE 02 study, the aim
was to increase the rate of pCR by intensifying the primary chemotherapy to improve survival. Patients received
7 cycles of primary chemotherapy. The PEGASE 02
scheme was modified as follows: 3 cycles of 100 mg/m2 of
docetaxel with G-CSF every 2 weeks were integrated after
the first 2 cycles of CD, and the second CD cycle was similar to the first 1 (C 6 g/m2 and D 75 mg/m2). The fifth
and the sixth cycles of CD delivered C 3 g/m2 and D 75
mg/m2. HSCs were harvested after cycle(s) 1 þ /-2, and
reinfused after cycles 6 and 7. The primary endpoint was
pCR, and secondary endpoints were 5-year DFS and OS.
After the enrolment of 54 patients, the study was prematurely stopped on June 1999 because of toxicity, notably
hematological with serious infectious complications (8
patients) and 2 deaths during febrile neutropenia. The
pCR rate, assessed in 48 women, was 30%, similar to that
reported in PEGASE 02 trial. Survival data are being
analyzed.31
These 2 trials led to the following conclusions: first,
increase of the pCR rate with intensified regimen and
increase of 3-year survival; second, more than 4 cycles of
intensified primary chemotherapy does not seem to pro-

vide any benefit; and third, because of the high rate of
relapse, need for testing maintenance chemotherapy with
drugs not used during induction phase. On the basis of
these data, the PEGASE 07 trial was launched on 2000.
In this phase 3 trial, patients were randomized at time of
inclusion to receive after primary chemotherapy followed
by surgery and radiotherapy, either no chemotherapy, or
4 cycles of docetaxel (85 mg/m2) and 5FU (3500 mg/m2
over 4 days) every 3 weeks as maintenance chemotherapy.
Primary chemotherapy comprised 4 cycles of C-Epirubicin regimen (C 4 g/m2 and E 150 mg/m2 per cycle every 3
weeks) with harvest of HSC after cycle 1 and reinfusion
after cycles 2, 3, and 4. The trial was closed on June 2005
after the expected accrual of 175 patients. The primary
endpoint is the 3-year DFS. Secondary endpoints include
pCR, OS, quality of life, and translational studies. First
results will be available by the end of 2009.
Globally, the results of these studies, which enrolled
329 patients over a 10-year period, are interesting in term
of pathological response and early event-free survival.
Today, the approach remains limited to specialized centers and remains experimental. More mature follow-up of
published and ongoing studies is required, as well as larger
collaborative prospective trials. Another crucial objective
is to define predictors for selecting patients the most susceptible to selectively benefit from HDC.32,33 Nonetheless, the difficulty of these studies and the relatively high
rate of relapse after conventional or high-dose chemotherapy impose testing in parallel with other innovative systemic therapeutic strategies such as targeted therapies.

TARGETED THERAPIES
IBC is highly angiogenic and overexpresses the ERBB2
and EGFR tyrosine kinase receptors more frequently than
non-IBC.34 These observations inevitably led to test in
IBC patients the biological therapies targeting the corresponding pathways and recently approved in combination
with chemotherapy for the treatment of non-IBC.
Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against ERBB2. Its introduction
into the treatment of ERBB2-positive metastatic35,36 and
early stage breast cancer37-40 improves survival of patients.
The high rate of pCR (60%) reported by Buzdar et al in
early stage breast cancer after delivery of trastuzumab associated with an anthracycline/taxane-based regimen of primary chemotherapy41 prompted several studies at
assessing its association with neoadjuvant conventionaldose chemotherapy in ERBB2-positive locally advanced

breast cancers (LABC) including IBC. High rates of pCR
were observed, ranging from 17 to 55%.42-50 In a substudy50 of the NOAH (Neoadjuvant Herceptin) study,49
76 women with IBC, including 31 ERBB2-positive
patients were assessed: the pCR rate was 55% for patients
who received trastuzumab and standard chemotherapy
compared with 19% for patients who received chemotherapy only. Although these series are limited in size, and
given the survival advantage observed in early stage breast
cancer, these results strongly argue for use of trastuzumab
in treatment of patients with ERBB2-positive IBC. The
interest for targeting ERBB2 in IBC was further confirmed by the activity of lapatinib—a dual inhibitor of
both ERBB2 and EGFR approved in the treatment of
ERBB2-positive metastatic breast cancer after failure of
trastuzumab51—in 2 phase 2 trials,52,53 with 95% of clinical response after a combination of lapatinib and paclitaxel in a series of 21 chemotherapy-naive ERBB2positive IBC patients.53
The other targeted therapies recently assessed in
IBC are antiangiogenic drugs, notably bevacizumab. Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody to VEGF, improves the response rate when
delivered in combination with chemotherapy in previously heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer
patients,54 and it improves the response and progressionfree survival rates when associated with first-line chemotherapy in metastatic patients.55 Bevacizumab was then
tested in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting with promising results in terms of feasibility
and efficacy.56-58 The feasibility of combining bevacizumab and anthracycline-based chemotherapy was recently
reported in the adjuvant59 and neoadjuvant setting60,61 of
breast cancer patients. To date, studies with bevacizumab
in IBC patients are scarcer than those with trastuzumab.60-62 Wedam et al treated 21 patients with LABC (1
patient) and IBC (20 patients) with neoadjuvant bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab plus docetaxel and doxorubicin chemotherapy.60 The clinical partial response
rate was 67%. The pCR rate was not available. Antiangiogenic and antitumor effects were documented on tumor
biopsies63 and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging64 by serial assessments performed prior,
during, and after the neoadjuvant treatment.
In this context, it was important to set up phase 2
studies in IBC, excluding LABC, to test the impact of
combining anthracyclines and taxane-based chemotherapy with active targeted therapies in the neoadjuvant treatment. In France, 2 phase 2 national multicentric trials,

2832

Beverly 1 and Beverly 2, conducted by P. Viens have been
recently launched to assess the introduction of bevacizumab in the primary treatment of ERBB2-negative (Beverly 1) and ERBB2-positive (Beverly 2 in combination
with trastuzumab) nonmetastatic IBC patients. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are the same (except the
ERBB2 status) in the 2 studies exclusively dedicated to
IBC patients. The endpoints are also similar. The primary
endpoint is the rate of pCR on surgical samples after the
neoadjuvant treatment. The secondary endpoints include
the rate of DFS and OS at 3 and 5 years, the toxicity
notably cardiac, and many translational research studies
aimed at identifying markers predictive of efficacy and/or
toxicity (circulating tumor and endothelial cells, pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, and imaging). Beverly 2 is promoted by Roche
SAS. It will assess the combination of bevacizumab with
standard trastuzumab and primary chemotherapy in
ERBB2-positive IBC. The rationale for combining the 2
antibodies comes from preclinical and clinical data. In a
human breast cancer xenograft model, the antitumor activity was enhanced when trastuzumab was combined
with bevacizumab.65 The combination of the 2 monoclonal antibodies, bevacizumab and trastuzumab was administered for the first time to human subjects in a phase 1
study including metastatic breast cancer patients.66 The
activity of the association was then confirmed in a phase 2
trial,67 with objective responses in 20 of 37 (54%) assessable patients with an advanced ERBB2-positive breast
cancer, as well as an acceptable toxicity profile, notably
cardiac. The Beverly 2 design is as follows (Fig. 1). During
the first phase (neoadjuvant treatment: 24 weeks), the
patients receive 4 cycles of FEC100 (5FU 500 mg/m2,
epirubicin 100 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2)
plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks, followed by
4 cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m2) plus bevacizumab (15
mg/kg) and trastuzumab (6 mg/kg) every 3 weeks. The
second phase is the surgery with mastectomy and axillary
lymph node dissection, performed at least 4 weeks after
the last infusion of bevacizumab. Trastuzumab is maintained during surgery every 3 weeks. The third phase is
the adjuvant treatment, which includes radiation therapy
(during approximately 6 weeks) plus bevacizumab (every
3 weeks restarted during the radiotherapy period and then
continued for 30 additional weeks) and trastuzumab (every 3 weeks continued during the radiotherapy period and
then for 30 additional weeks). If the tumor is hormone receptor-positive, hormone therapy is introduced after the
end of radiotherapy (scheme left at the investigator’s

discretion). Each patient will receive 8 cycles of chemotherapy (neoadjuvant), 18 cycles of trastuzumab (neoadjuvant/adjuvant), and 18 cycles of bevacizumab
(neoadjuvant/adjuvant). The hypothesis is that this antiangiogenic targeted therapy will improve the clinical outcome, by increasing the pCR rate from 20% to 40%. A
total of 50 patients will be included over a 24-month
recruitment period with a Simon 2-step design. The first
patient was included on September 2008 and the study is
ongoing with a recruitment above that expected. Beverly
1 the same trial, but dedicated to ERBB2 negative IBC. It
is promoted by the French Federation of Cancer Centers
(French Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte
Contre le Cancer). Designed to assess the combination of
bevacizumab with standard primary chemotherapy, its
scheme is the same than that of Beverly 2, but without
trastuzumab. The hypothesis is that bevacizumab will
increase the pCR rate from 20% to 30%. A total of 100
patients will be included over an 18-month recruitment
period with a Simon 2-step design. The first patient was
included on January 2009 and the study is ongoing with
the expected recruitment rate.

CONCLUSION
Multimodal chemotherapy has improved prognosis of
IBC. Current standard regimens include anthracycline
and taxane, combined with trastuzumab for ERBB2-positive tumors. However, there is still significant room for
improvement in survival of patients. In France, since
1995, more than 380 patients with nonmetastatic IBC
Cancer

June 1, 2010

have been included in national multicentric clinical trials
testing first the value of HDC with HSCT, and, more
recently, the value of targeted therapies in the neoadjuvant
and adjuvant treatment. Enrolment is still ongoing for the
later. HDC with HSCT remains an experimental
approach with high pCR rates and which likely benefits
subgroups of patients, who remain to be identified.
Another major research direction is based on a better
understanding of the molecular features of IBC, a crucial
objective. It has already allowed for the development of
therapies targeting ERBB2-dependent pathways and
angiogenesis with promising results. With the large number of new potential therapeutic targets that will be identified in the near future and the large number of emerging
novel drugs, there is hope that cure becomes an achievable
goal. But we must also keep in mind the great heterogeneity of IBC at the biological level with the existence of molecular subtypes similar to those described in nonIBC.68,69 This heterogeneity will have to be taken into
account in the design of future clinical and translational
studies. In this context, it is the responsibility of the scientific community (medical, translational, and fundamental) to design large-scale collaborative studies centered on
this rare, heterogeneous, but aggressive disease.
