ABSTRACT:
Prognostic and predictive markers utilized in invasive breast carcinoma are
limited and include ER, PR, Ki67, and ERBB2 (HER2). In the case of HER2, overexpression or amplification serves as eligibility for anti-HER2 based therapy, including
trastuzumab (Herceptin®, Genentech). While clinical trials have shown trastuzumab
improves overall survival and time to progression, an individual’s response to antiHER2 based therapy is highly variable. This suggests that, in a “uniform” HER2
positive population, additional markers could help in predicting patient outcome to
therapy. Here we utilized a recently validated high-specificity HER4 antibody (E200)
and generated a standard clinical HER4 scoring algorithm (HER4 H-Score) utilizing two
breast carcinoma cohorts: 1) patients receiving neoadjuvant trastuzumab (n=47) and
2) patients receiving trastuzumab for metastatic disease (n=33). Our HER4 H-Score
showed significant correlation with high sensitivity RT-qPCR performed on matched
patients (p=<0.0001). In addition, patients with HER2/HER4 co-over-expression
status showed a significant delay in development of metastasis after neo-adjuvant
trastuzumab therapy (p= 0.04) and showed a significant improvement in progression
free survival after adjuvant trastuzumab therapy (p=0.03). These findings suggest
HER4 IHC, used in conjunction with a standard HER2 testing algorithm, could aid
in predicting clinical outcome and help identify patients likely to show improved
response to trastuzumab therapy.

INTRODUCTION

This differential response cannot be solely attributed
to discrepancies in expression and amplification status
as determined by standard laboratory HER2 testing,
including immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) methodologies [9]. In a
“uniform” population of HER2 positive cases, it is
reasonable to hypothesize that refined outcome prediction
can be achieved by assessing alternative biomarkers.
Candidate markers for refining predicted outcome
post trastuzumab therapy include the remaining EGFR
family members (HER1, HER3, and HER4). These
proteins are membrane bound and form homo- and
hetero-dimers with HER2 and participate in regulating

ERBB2 (HER2) is a well-characterized membrane
receptor in the EGFR family and a therapeutic target
in invasive breast carcinoma. Targeted anti-HER2
therapy with trastuzumab in patients with HER2 overexpression or amplification improves overall survival and
recurrence free survival [1]. While HER2 over-expression/
amplification is a prerequisite for patient eligibility to
receive anti-HER2 based therapy, an individual’s response
to such treatment is highly variable. Some HER2 positive
patients have essentially no response while others may
achieve a complete response and/or remission [2-8].

downstream signaling [10]. Recent literature has
supplied direct evidence that HER4 plays a key role in
modulating response to trastuzumab therapy [11]. Early
in vitro studies using HER2 positive cell lines showed
that transfection and over-expression of HER4 resulted
in increased apoptosis [12, 13]. These studies provided
the first mechanistic evidence that HER4 over-expression
serves as a block to HER2 signaling activity, when HER2
and HER4 are co-over-expressed. Unlike HER2, HER4
over-expression appears to have an anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptotic activity [14, 15]. In studies performed
on human breast carcinoma, the reported prevalence of
HER4 over-expression ranges from 12% to 82% in tumors
and has been linked to both improved and poor clinical
outcome, depending on antibody and study design [16-18].
This wide range of reported over-expression highlights a
fundamental challenge of interpreting previous HER4
studies in breast carcinoma, which is the lack of a
clinically validated standard anti-HER4 antibody and IHC
scoring algorithm[11, 18, 19].
One potential reason for a lack of standardization
in clinical IHC studies is the complex nature of HER4,
which has four distinct isoforms secondary to proteolytic
cleavage that can induce localization to multiple subcellular locations [20, 21]. Of the four isoforms of HER4,
only one isoform is expressed in breast carcinoma (JM-a)
[22, 23]. The expressed isoform can be membrane bound,
or once proteolytically cleaved, can produce a soluble
extra-cellular domain and a free intra-cellular domain.
The cleavage site contributes to the unique localization
and function of HER4 and likely plays a critical role in
regulating HER2 positive carcinomas and the therapeutic
response to HER2 over-expressing tumors[11, 18, 19, 2428].
Recently a large number of HER4 antibodies were
screened using both cell lines transfected with HER1,
HER2, HER3, and HER4; and breast carcinoma samples
[29]. The anti-HER4 clone E200 showed the greatest
sensitivity and specificity for HER4 detection. In addition,
this antibody showed a range of staining intensities in
breast carcinoma cases, that was quantifiable and likely
attributable to differences in HER4 expression status
between patients. Based on these findings, the HER4 E200
clone was selected for use in the present study.
In this study, we set out to evaluate the predictive
nature of HER4 over-expression in patients treated with
trastuzumab therapy. To accomplish this we generated
and standardized a novel IHC scoring algorithm for
HER4 (H-Score). Utilization of this HER4 H-Score in
conjunction with HER2 expression data, showed that
patients that co-over-expressed both HER4 and HER2
showed a delay in development of metastasis (neoadjuvant
population) and improved progression free survival
(metastatic population). These findings demonstrate the
clinical value of addition of HER4 expression data in
the context of other standard markers including HER2,

RESULTS
Determination of HER2 and HER4 Status in
Neoadjuvant and Metastatic Trastuzumab
Treated Cohorts
Distributions of clinical and pathologic
characteristics of both the neoadjuvant and metastatic
cohorts are presented in Table1. HER2 status was
determined for each patient sample using multiple
independent
methodologies
which
included
immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH)
[(Fluorescent (FISH) and Dual DNA (DISH)], and real
time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).
In the neoadjuvant cohort, consensus in at least two
out of the three methodologies (IHC, ISH, RT-qPCR) was
required for classification of HER2 as over-expressed. In
the neoadjuvant cohort, 36 of 47 patients demonstrated
HER2 over-expression (Table1). Minor discrepancies were
observed in 4 cases by IHC, which showed 2+ equivocal
staining, however, all 4 cases were identified as amplified
on HER2 reflex ISH testing (Supplemental Table 1).
Discrepancy by RT-qPCR were seen in 3 cases which were
classified as HER2 non-amplified, however these cases
were 3+ by IHC and amplified by ISH (RT-qPCR scores
6.33, 6.75, and 6.9; Supplemental Table 1).
In the metastatic cohort, consensus in at least two
out of the three methodologies resulted in classification
of HER2 as over-expressed in 27 of 33 patients (Table1).
No discrepancies were identified by any methodology in
the HER2 over-expressed population. However, one case
classified as non-over-expressed showed an equivocal 2+
IHC staining, this case was negative by both FISH and
HER2 RT-qPCR score (1.7 FISH ratio and 6.59 HER2 RTqPCR score).
Classification of HER4 expression status was
determined by application of a pathologist based semiquantitative IHC derived H-Score. Representative
images of HER4 (E200) IHC staining patterns including
membrane and cytoplasmic staining are shown in Figure 1.
The analytical sensitivity of the IHC score was correlated
with HER4 RT-qPCR analysis of matched specimens. The
correlation between HER4 H-Score and HER4 RT-qPCR
was highly significant, with a correlation coefficient of r2=
0.85 (p<0.0001; CI: 0.80-0.94) for the neoadjuvant cohort
(Figure 2A) and r2= 0.75 (p<0.0001; CI: 0.44-0.84) for
the metastatic cohort (Figure 2B). Based on the significant
correlation between RT-qPCR and HER4 H-Score, ROC
curve analysis was used to identify an H-Score value
that corresponded to HER4 over-expression. Based on
ROC curve analysis, an H-Score cut off of ≥85 for HER4

(CI: 71.2- 99.0) and specificity 96.7% (CI: 88.3-100)

metastatic cohort, an H-Score cut off of ≥85 for HER4
over-expression showed maximal sensitivity 91.7% (CI:
68.8- 98.9) and specificity 95.2% (CI: 72.6- 99.1) (Figure

In the neoadjuvant cohort, three clinical outcome
measures were evaluated which included complete
pathologic response (CpR), overall survival (OS), and
development of metastasis post trastuzumab therapy
(Mets). Analysis based solely on HER2 expression

HER4 expression status, showed no significant difference
in CpR, OS, or development of Mets (p-values: 0.56, 0.79,
and 0.28 respectively) (Table 2). Kaplan-Meier plots for
OS and development of METS based on HER2 expression
status or HER4 expression status showed no significant
predictive ability based on either single marker, plots are
shown in Figure 3.
Due to the low number of HER2 negative cases (6
out of 33) in the metastatic cohort, a statistical evaluation
of clinical outcomes based solely on HER2 status was not
sufficiently powered.

HER4 co-expression status showed co-over-expression
of HER2 and HER4 resulted in a significant ability to
predictive metastasis free survival but not OS, plots are
shown in are shown in Figure 5A-B.
In the metastatic cohort, by IHC, 11 cases were
positive for both HER2 and HER4, 16 cases were positive
for HER2 and negative for HER4, 2 cases were negative
for HER2 and positive for HER4, and 4 cases were
negative for both HER2 and HER4 (Figure 4B). Due to
the low number of cases lacking HER2 over-expression,
an evaluation of clinical outcomes in this population was
not considered meaningful. However, clinical outcomes
including progression free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) were evaluated for cases with HER2 overexpression in the metastatic cohort. For PFS, there was
a significant difference between patients that co-overexpressed both HER2 and HER4 vs. patients that lacked
HER4 over-expression (HER2 positive/HER4 negative)
(p=0.03) (Figure 6A). Additionally, in this cohort, the
median PFS improved from 6 months in cases lacking
HER4 over-expression (HER2-Pos/HER4-Neg) to 13
months in cases with HER4 over-expression (HER2Pos/HER4-Pos) (Figure 6A). Evaluation of OS in this
cohort revealed a clear separation in the survival curves
between patients with co-over-expression of HER2 and
HER4 vs. patients that lacked HER4 over-expression
(HER2-Pos and HER4-Neg); this difference did not reach
statistical significance (p=0.47) (Figure 6B). However, in
this metastatic cohort, the median OS improved from 25

Evaluation of Clinical Outcome using Combined

negative for HER2 and positive for HER4, and 5 cases
were negative for both HER2 and HER4 (Figure 4A). For
CpR and OS, no statistical difference was observed for
any HER2/HER4 combination (Table 3). However, for
development of Mets, there was a significant difference
between patients that co-over-expressed both HER2 and
HER4 as compared to all other combinations of HER2/
HER4 expression (p=0.002-0.02) (Table 3). Kaplan-Meier

marker in breast carcinoma, the predictive marker status of
HER4 is largely unconfirmed. Previous HER4 IHC studies
in breast cancer have implicated this target as a potential
new predictive biomarker in patients receiving anti-HER2
therapy. However, findings from these previous studies
are diminished due to the lack of consistent antibody and
lack of controls showing antibody specificity for HER4. In
addition, alternative splicing of HER4-encoded products
results in multiple isoforms that can be present in multiple
cellular locations. Due to these challenges, the role of
HER4 as a predictive marker in trastuzumab treated breast
cancer remains unconfirmed.
In this study, we evaluated whether HER4 can serve
as a potential predictive biomarker in trastuzumab treated
breast carcinoma. We accomplished this by first, utilizing
a single HER4 antibody (E200) which was recently
stringently tested and validated in breast carcinoma and
second, by developing a standardized semi-quantitative
H-Score system for determining HER4 expression status
in breast carcinoma. Based on the recently published work
by Jay et al., we chose to utilize the HER4 E200 clone
to develop our clinical based IHC H-Score expression
assay. We evaluated our HER4 H-Score in two invasive
breast carcinoma cohorts that received trastuzumab 1) in
a neoadjuvant setting (n=47) and 2) for metastatic disease
(n=33). These two cohorts showed significant overlap
in clinical and pathological characteristics. The only
exceptions included, the neoadjuvant cohort was older
at presentation and presented with a lower tumor grade.
However, the HER2 and HER4 expression profiles and
percent showing over-expression were highly consistent
between the two cohorts.

To circumvent problems observed in previous
qualitative HER4 studies, we chose to standardize a single
antibody and use a semi-quantitative scoring system for
HER4 expression in breast carcinoma. To assess the
analytical sensitivity of the HER4 IHC H-Score, we
utilized RT-qPCR for HER4 as a standard for comparison,
due to the high sensitivity of the qPCR assay and our
previous success with validation of a HER2 RT-qPCR
assay [30]. Like our previous HER2 based RT-qPCR,
HER4 amplification was successfully quantified using
this assay. The HER4 RT-qPCR values were directly
correlated to HER4 H-Scores and a significant correlation
was identified. Furthermore, ROC curve analysis utilizing
HER4 RT-qPCR and HER4 H-Scores demonstrated an
optimal cut off for HER4 over-expression status (H-Score
of greater than or equal to 85). This value was consistent
between both the neoadjuvant and metastatic cohorts. In
situ hybridization was not performed for HER4 due to
the lack of repeat-deleted probes available for this target.
Future studies utilizing ISH are warranted and a novel
HER4 ISH probe is in development for this purpose.
Both cohorts were evaluated for clinical and
pathologic outcome measures based on combinations of
HER2 and HER4 expression status. Analysis based on
HER2 or HER4 expression status alone in the neoadjuvant
cohort failed to predict CpR, OS, or Met free survival.
This single marker analysis was not relevant in the
metastatic cohort due to lack of a significant number of
HER2 negative cases for a meaningful comparison.
While HER2 and HER4 single gene over-expression
failed to serve as a predictive marker for trastuzumab
therapy, paired analysis improved the predictive nature

of these markers. As demonstrated in the neoadjvant
cohort, co-over-expression of HER2 and HER4 showed
a significantly longer period of metastasis free survival.
Likewise, in the metastatic cohort, patients with co-overexpression of HER2 and HER4 demonstrated a longer
median PFS (7 month improvement) and an improved
median OS (19 month improvement).
While our results implicate HER2 and HER4 dual
over-expression is directly linked to predicting post
trastuzumab outcome, it is possible that other markers
including ER could play a critical role in influencing this
association. To address this issue, we analyzed the ER
expression status in our two cohorts and compared ER
expression in the context of the presence or absence of
HER4 over-expression. We observed that there was an
increased association between HER4 expression and coER expression in both cohorts (Supplemental Table 2).
However, further analysis revealed that ER expression
status failed to alter the significant difference in outcomes
seen based on the presence or absence of HER4 overexpression (Supplemental Figure 1). This finding does
not exclude the possibility that an additional biomarker

modulates the predictive ability of HER4, but it does
provide direct evidence that the predictive ability of HER4
is not a result of co-expression of ER.
The current study is limited by the retrospective
study design, relatively small patient populations and
enrichment by HER2 positive cases. In spite of these
limitations, we were able to generate and standardize a
novel H-Score system for determining HER4 expression
status and were able to utilize this new scoring system, in
conjunction with HER2 expression status, to significantly
segregate patients based on quantifiable outcome
measures. Expanding these studies to larger cohorts may
reveal further significant predictive ability for metrics
such as overall survival, which in the neoadjuvant cohort
trended toward but did not reach statistical significance
(p=0.08). Finally, while direct comparison between equal
populations of HER2 positive and negative patients
would be ideal, this is not possible due to the toxicity of
trastuzumab and the current reservation of this drug for
HER2 positive cases, thereby excluding the recruitment
of an equal number of HER2-negative patients. While
limitations were present in this study, one of the great

strengths of this study includes use of a neoadjuvant
cohort, which allowed definitive outcome measures
post trastuzumab treatment via direct visualization/
identification of tumor size at time of resection.
While HER2 negative patients are not candidates for
trastuzumab therapy, it is interesting that of the 47 patients
that received trastuzumab in the neo-adjuvant cohort, 11
cases (23%) did not show IHC criteria for HER2 overexpression on pretreatment biopsy material based on
ASCO/CAP guidelines. Of the 11 cases, 6 were equivocal
by IHC and 9 cases were equivocal by either FISH or
DISH (Supplemental Table 3). The remaining 2 cases
which were negative by FISH and DISH, were patients
that transferred care and had a positive HER2 report per
outside laboratory testing but were negative by in-house
testing. A second interesting finding was that the HER2
RT-qPCR assay identified all 11 of these cases as negative
(RT-qPCR score <7.0) (Supplemental Table 3).

This scoring system was validated with a highly sensitive
RT-qPCR assay and was applied to two separate breast
cancer cohorts. In both the neoadjuvant and metastatic
trastuzumab treated cohorts, HER4 over-expression,
in conjunction with over-expression of HER2, showed
significant predictive ability in selecting patients with
improved metastasis free survival, progression free
survival, and overall survival. Use of a dual HER2/HER4
IHC assay at time of diagnosis could improve outcome
prediction in patients treated with trastuzumab and
ultimately result in improved physician-patient counseling
on disease course.

CONCLUSION

Following approval of a registry (09-226) by
the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board, the
electronic medical records for all patients that had
received trastuzumab at the Cleveland Clinic from
1/1998 to 12/2010 were reviewed for potential inclusion
(445 patients). Of the 445 cases, 47 satisfied inclusion
criteria for analysis of subjects in the neoadjuvant setting,
which included a diagnosis of primary invasive breast

controls were performed by omitting the primary antibody.

Real Time-Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
HER2 and ERBB4 (HER4) RT-qPCR assays were
performed as previously published [30]. Briefly, all
unstained slides were cut fresh (one 4µm slide for H&E
and five 10µm slides for RT-qPCR). From the 10µm
unstained slides, 4 were macro-dissected, guided by
location of tumor identified by H&E. RNA extraction was
performed following macro-dissection using High Pure
RNA Paraffin Kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis,
IN). RT-qPCR was carried out in triplicate using a
TaqMan® RNA-to-CT™ 1-Step master mixtures Kit with
primers and monocolor hydrolysis probes Hs01001580_
m1 (HER2), Hs00955525_m1 (HER4), Hs00955525_m1
(B2M), Hs00984230_m1 (GAPDH), and Hs03929097_
g1 (TFRC) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
RT-qPCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 II
machine (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany)
running LightCycler® 480 SW 1.5 software according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RT-qPCR cycling
conditions for all the genes were as follows: 48°C for 15
min, 95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for
15 s, 60°C for 1 min, followed by 37°C for 1 min. PCR
products were subjected to electrophoresis on agarose
gel to confirm the absence of nonspecific PCR products.
Analysis of the crossing threshold point (CT) for the
amplification curves for each specimen was determined
by the second derivative maximum method [32]. Absolute
quantitation was performed with an in-run standard curve.
Results were expressed as the ratio of HER2 to reference
gene copies. Combination of two control genes, B2M
and GAPDH, provided superior separation of control
populations. Therefore B2M plus GAPDH were utilized as
reference genes for this study. All results were normalized
against calibrator RNA extracted from the MCF7 breast
cancer cell line.

Immunohistochemical analysis for HER2, HER4,
ER, and PR
All H&E and immune-labeled slides were reviewed
by two pathologists (BP and EM) who were blinded to
HER2/HER4 scores obtained by other methods or the
patient outcomes. A subset of sections was reviewed by
an additional pathologist (RRT).
HER2 IHC was scored according to ASCO/CAP
HER2 testing guidelines [31]. Briefly, a 3+ staining
pattern is interpreted as positive for HER2 and is defined
as uniform intense membrane staining of 30% of invasive
tumor cells. A 2+ staining pattern is interpreted as
equivocal for HER2 and is defined as complete membrane
staining that is either nonuniform or weak in intensity
but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least
10% of cells. A 0 or 1+ staining pattern is interpreted as
negative for HER2 (ERBB2) and is defined as no staining
(0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining (1+) in any
proportion of the tumor cells.
Consensus review of stain pattern and intensity
for HER4 (E200) IHC resulted in standardization and
generation of a traditional pathologist based H-score.
Briefly, in the invasive carcinoma regions of the
histologic sections, the chromogenic immunolabeling
was systematically categorized into four groups: 0 (no
membrane or cytoplasmic labeling), 1+ (weak cytoplasmic
labeling), 2+ (weak membrane and/or strong cytoplasmic
labeling), and 3+ (strong membrane (observable with

GRANT SUPPORT

HER2 FISH and DISH

This project was funded by a CAP Foundation
grant for advanced training in translational molecular
diagnostics awarded to BPP.

HER2 FISH or dual DNA in situ hybridization
(DISH) analysis was performed on each case of breast
carcinoma at the time of diagnosis utilizing paraffinembedded tissues with the PathVysion HER2 DNA
Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular-Vysis, Downers Grove,
IL); some cases were also evaluated using the INFORM
HER2 Dual ISH kit (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson,
AZ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions as
specified in the package insert. Each FDA kit contained
specific DNA probes to the HER2 gene locus and to the
alpha centromeric region of chromosome 17. The probe
signals were counted in 40 tumor nuclei per case under a
fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters. Results
were reported as the average ratio of HER2 signals to
chromosome 17 signals in non-overlapping interphase
invasive carcinoma nuclei.
