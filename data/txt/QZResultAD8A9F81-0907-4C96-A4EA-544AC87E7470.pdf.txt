Summary
Mutations in the EGFR kinase are a cause of non-small cell lung cancer. To understand their
mechanism of activation and effects on drug binding, we studied the kinetics of the L858R and G719S
mutants and determined their crystal structures with inhibitors including gefitinib, AEE788 and a
staurosporine. We find that the mutations activate the kinase by disrupting autoinhibitory
interactions, and that they accelerate catalysis as much as 50-fold in vitro. Structures of inhibitors in
complex with both wild-type and mutant kinases reveal similar binding modes for gefitinib and
AEE788, but a marked rotation of the staurosporine in the G719S mutant. Strikingly, direct binding
measurements show that gefitinib binds 20-fold more tightly to the L858R mutant than to the wildtype enzyme.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Significance—Mutations in the EGFR kinase domain occur in approximately 16% of NSCLCs,
but at much higher frequencies in selected populations including non-smokers, women, and East
Asian patients. The presence of these mutations correlates with response to small-molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR. Because the diverse mutations cluster around the catalytic cleft
and because differences in inhibitor sensitivity of the mutants have been reported, it is important to
understand the effect of the mutations on inhibitor binding at a structural level. The present work
provides a structural foundation for understanding the differential inhibitor sensitivities of the L858R
and G719S mutants, and will help guide rational application of currently available EGFR inhibitors
and development of more potent and perhaps mutation-specific inhibitors.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also called ErbB1, Her1) is a transmembrane
receptor tyrosine kinase that transduces signals critical for cell proliferation, differentiation
and motility. Upon growth factor binding, EGFR and other ErbB family members homo- or
hetero- dimerize and activate their cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains to initiate intracellular
signaling (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001;Schlessinger, 2004). Overexpression or mutational
activation of the EGFR is implicated in the development and progression of numerous human
malignancies, and a number of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been
developed to target the ATP-binding cleft of the EGFR (Hynes and Lane, 2005). Several of
these inhibitors are currently in clinical trials or have been approved for clinical use, including
the 4-anilinoquinazolines gefitinib (Iressa) (Wakeling et al., 2002), erlotinib (Tarceva) (Pollack
et al., 1999), and lapatinib (Rusnak et al., 2001), the pyrrolopyrimidine AEE788 (Traxler et
al., 2004), and the irreversible inhibitor HKI-272 (Tsou et al., 2005).

Deletion mutations in the extracellular portion of the EGFR have long been known to cause
constitutive, growth factor independent activation of the EGFR and are frequently found in
glioblastoma (Ekstrand et al., 1992). More recently, somatic mutations in the EGFR kinase
domain have been discovered in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) (Paez et al.,
2004;Lynch et al., 2004;Pao et al., 2004;Johnson and Janne, 2005;Gazdar et al., 2004;Chan et
al., 2006;Shigematsu and Gazdar, 2006). The presence of these mutations in NSCLC correlates
with responsiveness to TKIs including gefitinib and erlotinib. A number of distinct mutations
have been identified including point mutations within the nucleotide-binding loop in exon 18,
small deletions in exon 19 or insertions in exon 20, as well as point mutations in the activation
loop in exon 21. Structurally, these mutations cluster around the active site cleft of the tyrosine
kinase domain. The two most frequent mutations are the exon 19 deletion that removes residues
746–750 of the expressed protein and the exon 19 point substitution that replaces leucine 858
with arginine (L858R) (Chan et al., 2006;Shigematsu and Gazdar, 2006). The L858R
substitution is the single most common mutation (approximately 40% of all mutations), and it
lies in the activation loop (A-loop) of the kinase. Point mutations are also observed in glycine
719, albeit less frequently. Gly719 is found in the adjacent phosphate-binding “P-loop” of the
kinase, and is substituted with serine, cysteine or alanine. The L858R and G719S point
mutations, as well as the exon 19 deletions and exon 20 insertions, are transforming when
introduced into a variety of cell lines including fibroblasts and lung epithelial cells (Lynch et
al., 2004;Sordella et al., 2004;Arao et al., 2004;Greulich et al., 2005;Amann et al.,
2005;Engelman et al., 2005).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Interestingly, the clinical correlation between the presence of specific mutations and
therapeutic response to TKIs is mirrored in cell lines and EGFR-transfected cells. Cells bearing
the mutant EGFR are in general more sensitive to TKIs than cells expressing the wild-type
kinase. In particular, the L858R mutant is 10–100 fold more sensitive to erlotinib and gefitinib
than the wild-type kinase (Pao et al., 2004;Greulich et al., 2005;Mukohara et al., 2005) and
significantly more sensitive than the G719S mutant (Jiang et al., 2005). At the same time, the
exceptions to this rule—for example, the exon 20 insertion mutants are highly resistant to both
gefitinib and erlotinib (Greulich et al., 2005)—further underscore the dependence of inhibitor
responses on specific mutations.
The structure of the wild-type EGFR kinase domain has been previously determined in both
active and inactive conformations. The crystal structure was first reported alone and in complex
with erlotinib (Stamos et al., 2002). Both the apo-EGFR and the EGFR/erlotinib structures
reveal an active conformation of the kinase, although Tyr 869 in activation loop is not
phosphorylated. This observation is consistent with the previous finding that the
phosphorylation of the EGFR activation loop is not required for activity (Tice et al., 1999).

The structure of wild-type EGFR kinase in complex with lapatinib (Wood et al., 2004) showed
that the kinase can adopt an inactive conformation closely resembling that previously observed
in Src-family (Williams et al., 1997;Xu et al., 1997;Sicheri et al., 1997) and cyclin-dependent
kinases (De Bondt et al., 1993). In this inactive conformation, the regulatory “C-helix” is
displaced from the active site. The bulky 4-anilino substituent in lapatinib cannot be
accomodated in the active conformation of the kinase, and thus lapatinib appears to trap the
kinase in the inactive conformation with the C-helix displaced (Wood et al., 2004). Very
recently, a structural dissection of the mechanism of activation of the EGFR confirmed the Src/
CDK-like state of the inactive kinase, and demonstrated a cyclin-like mechanism of activation
involving asymmetric dimerization of the EGFR kinase domain (Zhang et al., 2006).
The discovery of activating mutation in the EGFR kinase domain and their differential
sensitivity to inhibitors poses a number of structurally interesting and clinically relevant
questions. How do the mutations activate the kinase? How do they affect inhibitor binding?
And most importantly, to what extent will optimal therapeutic strategies require inhibitors
tailored to specific mutations? While the sensitivity of EGFR-mutant tumors and cell lines may
derive from an “oncogene addiction” effect (Gazdar et al., 2004), it may also stem, at least in
part, from structural differences in the mutant kinases that confer intrinsic susceptibility to
particular inhibitors (Lynch et al., 2004;Greulich et al., 2005).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to begin to address these questions, we have determined the structure of the wild-type
EGFR kinase and the L858R and G719S mutants in complex with inhibitors including gefitinib,
AEE788, the staurosporine compound AFN941, and the ATP-analog AMP-PNP. Additionally,
we have characterized the kinetics of the wild-type and mutant kinases in vitro. We find that
the L858R mutant is 50-fold more active than the wild-type kinase, and the G719S mutant
approximately 10-fold more active than wild-type. Examination of the mutant structures
reveals an overall conformation very similar to that of the wild-type kinase in the active state.
Comparisons with the inactive wild-type EGFR structure indicate that the L858R and G719S
mutations activate the kinase by disrupting interactions that stabilize the inactive conformation.
Analysis of the inhibitor complexes shows that the binding mode of AMP-PNP, AEE788 and
gefitinib is very similar among the wild-type, L858R and G719S kinases. In contrast, we
observe a marked rotation of the staurosporine analog AFN941 in the binding cleft of the G719S
mutant as compared with its orientation in the wild-type protein. Direct measurement of the
binding of gefitinib and AEE788 to the wild-type and mutant kinases reveals that both
compounds bind with greater affinity to the L858R mutant than to the wild-type kinase or
G719S mutant. Notably, gefitinib binds 20 times more tightly to the L858R mutant.

Structure and activity of the L858R and G719S mutants
The structures of the L858R and G719S mutants of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain were
determined in complex with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, or with inhibitors
including gefitinib, AEE788, or AFN941. In order to facilitate direct comparison, the wildtype EGFR kinase was also analyzed. A total of 12 structures were determined at resolutions
ranging from 2.4 to 3.4 Å as summarized in Table 1. The wild-type and mutant proteins
crystallized with the same crystal packing, but crystals of the L858R mutant were only obtained
using polyethylene glycol 400 as a precipitant while the wild-type and G719S proteins
produced better crystals in potassium sodium tartrate. When possible, we compare structures
obtained in the same buffer condition (see Methods).
Both the L858R and G719S mutants adopt overall conformations that are very similar to that
of the wild-type kinase in the activated conformation. The structure of the wild-type kinase in
complex with AMP-PNP is shown in Figure 1A; superpositions with the L858R and G719S

mutant structures are shown in Figs. 1B and 1C. The L858R mutant superimposes on the wildtype enzyme with an RMSD of 0.33Å for 292 C-α atoms, while the G719S mutant
superimposes on the wild-type structure with an RMSD of 0.37Å. The close correspondence
of the mutant kinases with the active conformation of the wild-type enzyme is not unexpected,
as the mutants presumably must retain catalytic activity in order to induce transformation.
The L858R mutation lies in the N-terminal portion of the activation loop. The substitution of
the larger, positively charged arginine side chain for the hydrophobic leucine side chain is
readily accomodated in this active conformation of the kinase (Figure 1B). We note that there
is no shift in the protein backbone around Arg 858, nor at residue Pro 877, which is opposite
Arg 858 on the C-terminal lobe of the kinase. The side chain of Arg858 is well-ordered, and
forms a hydrogen bond with the mainchain carbonyl of Arg 836.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The G719S substitution is located in the N-terminal lobe of the kinase, within the phosphatebinding “P-loop”. Gly 719 is the first glycine in the ‘GXGXXG’ sequence motif in the P-loop,
which arches over the triphosphate moeity of the ATP substrate and participates in its
coordination. In all structures described here (both wild-type and mutant), this loop appears to
be loosely ordered as the corresponding electron density is weak. In the context of the active
kinase, the substitution of Gly719 with serine is readily accomodated – the mainchain is not
in a conformation that favors glycine, and the serine sidechain extends toward the β-phosphate
of the bound ATP analog (Fig. 1C). Comparison of the G719S, L858R and wild-type kinases
reveals an identical AMP-PNP binding mode in all three structures. Thus the G719S mutant
retains catalytic competence, despite substitution of this conserved residue.
Because the activating mutations are found in regions critical for binding of substrates, we
characterized the catalytic activity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes. The kinetic
parameters for ATP and a peptide substrate (poly-Glu4Tyr1) were determined using a
continuous, colorimetric in vitro kinase assay and are summarized in Table 2. The activity
(kcat) of the wild-type and mutant kinases is also plotted in Figure 1D. The L858R mutant is
approximately 50-fold more active than the wild-type enzyme, and the G719S mutant is about
10 times more active than wild-type. We measured similar increases in catalytic rate for both
mutants using a physiologic substrate peptide derived from the Tyr 1197 autophosphorylation
site in place of poly- Glu4Tyr1 (Supplemental Table S1). The increased catalytic activity of
the mutants, as compared with the wild-type enzyme, likely results from a shift of the
equilibrium toward the active conformation of the enzyme (see below). As previously observed
for the wild-type kinase (Tice et al., 1999), autophosphorylation of the kinase activation loop
does not appreciably alter the catalytic rate in our experiments with the wild-type or mutant
enzymes (supplemental Figure S1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The G719S mutant has a Km for peptide substrate that is very close to that of the wild-type
enzyme, while the Km of the L858R mutant for peptide is about half that of the wild-type
kinase. The effect of the L858R mutation on the Km for peptide substrate is not surprising,
given its proximity to the expected binding site for peptide substrates. Likewise, the ~14-fold
increase in the Km of the G719S mutant for ATP is consistent with the modest structural effects
of this mutation in the ATP binding pocket. The L858R mutation also affects the affinity for
ATP, but to a lesser extent (approximately 5-fold higher Km than the wild-type kinase). These
modest changes in affinity for ATP are likely to be irrelevant in vivo, given that intracellular
ATP concentrations are in the millimolar range. The kinetic parameters we determined for the
wild-type kinase are very close to those previously reported for EGFR using a different assay
system (Brignola et al., 2002). Additionally, while the present work was in review, Zhang et
al. reported a ~20 fold (kcat/Km) activation of the L858R mutant kinase in vitro (Zhang et al.,
2006), and in a separate study Carey et al. found a ~2-fold increase it its Km for ATP (Carey
et al., 2006).

Mechanism of Activation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Comparison of the structures of the mutant kinases with the previously determined structure
of the wild-type kinase in an inactive conformation (Fig. 2A) shows that the mutations are
expected to destabilize the inactive conformation, and therefore to promote the active
conformation of the kinase (Fig. 2B). In particular, the L858R mutation is clearly incompatible
with the inactive conformation. This structure was determined in complex with the small
molecule inhibitor Lapatinib (Wood et al., 2004), and is very similar to that recently reported
for an activation-resistant mutant of the EGFR (Zhang et al., 2006). In this inactive
conformation, the C-helix is rotated outward and displaced from the active site, and the Nterminal portion of the activation loop forms a helical turn that locks the C-helix in the inactive
position. Leucine 858 is within this helical turn, and forms key hydrophobic interactions with
other residues in the N-lobe (Fig. 2A). Substitution of this residue with arginine, which has a
much larger charged side chain, cannot be accomodated in this inactive conformation. In
contrast, the L858R substitution is readily accomodated in the active form of the enzyme as
demonstrated by the present structure (Figs. 1B,2B). Thus we conclude that the L858R
mutation locks the kinase in a constitutively active state because it prevents this activation loop
segment (residue 858 and flanking residues) from adopting the inactive, helical conformation.
It is likely that mutation of the adjacent leucine 861 to glutamine, which has also been observed
in gefitinib and erlotinib responsive NSCLCs (Shigematsu and Gazdar, 2006;Chan et al.,
2006), activates the kinase for the same reason (see Fig 2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We hypothesize that the G719S mutation also activates the kinase by destabilization of the
inactive conformation. The P-loop contributes to the set of interactions that hold the C-helix
in the inactive conformation, and a glycine residue at position 719 in the P-loop is favored for
its proper conformation in the inactive state. Phe 723, which lies at the end of the P-loop, packs
together with residues Leu 747 and Leu 862 – part of the same hydrophobic cluster surrounding
Leu 858 in the inactive conformation. In this conformation, the mainchain of Gly 719 is in a
conformation in which glycine is favored. Thus substitution with serine (or any non-glycine
residue) destabilizes the P-loop and in turn weakens the set of hydrophobic interactions that
locks the kinase in the inactive conformation (Figure 2A). We note that substitutions of G719
to alanine or cysteine also occur in NCSLC (Chan et al., 2006;Shigematsu and Gazdar,
2006).
Drug binding modes and affinities

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Gefitinib (Iressa)—Gefitinib is a 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor that is structurally similar
to erlotinib (Figure 3). The interactions of gefitinib in the active site of the wild-type EGFR
are shown in Figure 4A. The quinazoline ring is oriented with the 1-N in the back of the ATP
binding pocket, where it hydrogen bonds with the mainchain amide of Met 793. Met 793 lies
in the so-called “hinge” region of the kinase, which connect the N- and C- lobes. Unlike most
kinase inhibitors, gefitinib forms only a single hydrogen bond to the hinge. The 3-chloro-4fluoro aniline substituent extends into the hydrophobic pocket in the back of the ATP binding
cleft. The aniline ring forms approximately a 45° angle with the plane of the quinazoline, and
the chloro group orients “up” and is surrounded by the sidechains of residues Lys 745, Leu
788 and Thr 790. The fluorine substituent in the para position extends toward the side chains
of Leu 788, Met 766 and Glu762. The methoxy group in the 7 position of the quinazoline is
in van der Waals contact with Gly 796, but the orientation of the methyl group is not well
defined in the density. The 6-propylmorpholino group extends into solvent and is poorly
ordered as the electron density for this portion of the inhibitor is weak. This is consistent with
the reported structure-activity data for the compound, as this substituent was added to improve
the pharmacokinetic properties of the inhibitor (Barker et al., 2001). The binding mode of
gefitinib is strikingly similar to that previously reported for erlotinib (Stamos et al., 2002) see
supplemental Figure S2.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to address the question of whether the activating mutations might affect the binding
mode of gefitinib, we also determined structures of gefitinib in complex with the L858R and
G719S mutants. The active site regions of the wild-type, L858R, and G719S structures in
complex with gefitinib can be compared in Figures 4A, C, and E, respectively. The binding
mode is the same in all three structures; small differences in the propylmorpholino “tail” of
the compound are not significant as this substituent is poorly defined in all three structures (see
supplemental Figure S3). The gefitinib-bound structures are also very similar to the
corresponding AMP-PNP complexes overall, but a clear shift in the protein backbone is noted
at Arg 776 and Leu 777 in the back of the inhibitor binding pocket (by 1.7 and 0.6 Å,
respectively). This shift is accompanied by a side chain rotation of Thr 790 (such that it
hydrogen bonds with the mainchain carbonyl of Arg 776), and appears to be induced by the
bulky chloroaniline group (not shown). A similar shift is observed in complex with AEE788.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Despite the close structural correspondence of the wild-type and mutant proteins, we find
marked differences in their affinity for gefitinib. We measured binding of gefitinib and AEE788
to the wild-type, L858R and G719S mutants using a fluorescence quenching assay (see
methods). As shown in Table 3, gefitinib binds the wild-type enzyme with Kd = 53.5 nM, but
binds the L858R mutant 20-fold more tightly (Kd= 2.6 nM). In contrast, binding to the G719S
mutant is somewhat weaker (Kd=123.6 nM) than to the wild-type kinase. Because the inhibitor
must compete with ATP for binding in vivo, the ratio of the inhibitor Kd to the Km for ATP is
a better estimate of potency (Table 3). These ratios show that gefitinib is ~100-fold and ~6fold more potent against the L858R and G719S mutants, respectively, than against the wildtype kinase.
The higher affinity for the L858R mutant may be explained largely by tighter binding to the
active conformation of the kinase than to the inactive conformation. Simple modeling of
gefitinib in the inactive kinase (based on superposition with lapatinib) shows that favorable
van der Waals interactions in the back of the ATP binding cleft that we observe in the active
structures may be lost in the inactive state (not shown). It is possible that unique interactions
with the L858R mutant also contribute to the enhanced potency of gefitinib. In this regard, we
note that in a second crystal structure of the L858R mutant in complex with gefitinib
(determined in the same crystal lattice and with similar unit cell dimensions) we observe an
alternate conformation in which the aniline ring is rotated by 180° such that the meta- chlorine
substituent points down, and is positioned to form a “halogen bond” (Auffinger et al., 2004)
with the sidechain of Asp855 (supplemental Figure S4). This alternate binding mode may be
possible only in the L858R mutant because the concomitant reorientation of Asp 855 and its
coordination of a water molecule appear to be sterically hindered in the context of a leucine
residue at position 858.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The markedly tighter binding of gefitinib to the L858R mutant likely explains its potency
against cells bearing this mutation; L858R transformed Ba/F3 cells are significantly more
gefitinib- sensitive than G719S transformed cells (Jiang et al., 2005). Additionally, NIH-3T3
cells transformed by the L858R mutant are much more sensitive to gefitinib than cells
transformed by wild-type receptor with the addition of exogenous EGF (Greulich et al.,
2005). The similar compound erlotinib is also reported to be a more potent inhibitor of the
L858R mutant than of the wild-type or exon 19 deletion mutants in a cellular context (Pao et
al., 2004).
AEE788—The pyrrolopyrimidine compound AEE788 (Novartis Pharmaceuticals) is a potent
inhibitor of VEGFR and ErbB-family kinases (Traxler et al., 2004). It has low nanomolar
potency against the EGFR, and is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials in oncology. Structures of
the wild-type, L858R and G719S mutants in complex with AEE788 are shown in Fig. 4, panels
B, D and F, respectively. The pyrrolopyrimidine core of AEE788 hydrogen bonds with the

hinge, and the N3 atom interacts with the hydroxyl of Thr854 via a bridging water molecule.
The 4-phenylethylamine moeity extends into the hydrophobic pocket defined by Thr790,
Leu788, Lys745 and Met766. The 6-phenyl substituent is sandwiched between Leu718 above
and Gly796 below. Finally, the ethylpiperazine group extends toward solvent near Asp800 and
Glu804 at the edge of the active site. The space occupied by AEE788 is very similar to that
exploited by gefitinib and other anilinoquinazolines – the pyrrolopyrimidine moeity
superimposes with the quinazoline core and the phenylethylamine group superimposes with
the aniline ring in gefitinib. The binding mode of AEE788 is the same in the wild-type and
both the G719S and L858R mutants (Fig. 4B, D and F). AEE788 is also a more effective
inhibitor of the L858R and G719S mutants than of the wild-type kinase (Table 3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

G719S alters binding mode of staurosporine analog AFN941—In contrast to the
compounds described above, in which coordination of the quinazoline or pyrrolopyrimidine
cores of the inhibitors remains unchanged in the mutant kinases, the overall binding mode of
AFN941 is different in the G719S mutant as compared with the wild-type EGFR. AFN941 is
a derivative of staurosporine in which one indole ring system has been hydrogenated to improve
solubility (Boggon et al., 2005). In the wild-type kinase, the compound binds with lactam ring
in the back of the ATP binding pocket, where the keto-oxygen hydrogen bonds with the
backbone amide of Met 793 in the hinge (Figure 5A). The inhibitor is closely associated with
the roof of the ATP binding cleft and the P-loop, and it is positioned to form a hydrogen bond
between the ether oxygen of the glycosidic ring and the backbone amide of Gly 719 in the Ploop. In the G719S mutant, this close association with the P-loop is not possible and this
hydrogen bond is not formed. Instead, the inhibitor is rotated downward (toward the C-lobe)
by ~15° and rotated by ~30° deeper into the hydrophobic cleft in the back of the binding pocket
(Figure 5B). The inhibitor pivots about the hydrogen bond with the hinge region such that this
interaction is maintained. Additionally, hydrogen bonds are formed between the lactam ring
amide and the carbonyl of Gln 791 in the hinge region, and between the methylamino nitrogen
of the glycosidic ring in the inhibitor and the carbonyl of Arg 841. Curiously, the binding mode
we observe in the G719S mutant is closely similar to the binding mode of staurosporine in
other tyrosine kinases, including Jak3 (Boggon et al., 2005) and Lck (Zhu et al., 1999). We
find that AFN941 binds to the L858R mutant in precisely the same manner that it binds the
wild-type kinase (not illustrated). Although the staurosporine compound is not an EGFRspecific inhibitor, its divergent binding modes in the wild-type and L858R vs G719S kinases
structurally demonstrate that the lung-cancer derived mutations can disrupt or alter inhibitor
interactions.

Discussion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The successful development and clinical use of imatinib (Gleevec) as an inhibitor of the BCRAbl kinase in chronic myeloid leukemia established a paradigm for molecularly-targeted
therapy in oncology (Capdeville et al., 2002). The somatic mutations in the EGFR kinase that
drive lung and other cancers present an analogous opportunity for intervention in these cancers,
but with a critical distinction. In BCR-Abl, the mechanism of activation of the kinase is
allosteric and the kinase domain proper is unchanged from the wild-type kinase (apart from
emergent resistance mutations). It therefore presents a single molecular target for drug
development. In contrast, the mutations in the EGFR activate the kinase by disrupting
autoinhibitory interactions proximal to the ATP binding cleft. As we show here, these
mutations alter the kinase domain in a manner that dramatically affects inhibitor binding and
they therefore represent distinct targets for inhibitor development.
Our direct demonstration that gefitinib binds the L858R mutant 20-fold more tightly than the
wild-type enzyme can explain, at least in part, its efficacy in treatment of NSCLCs bearing this
substitution. Furthermore, the 50-fold weaker affinity of gefitinib for the G719S mutant (as

compared with the L858R protein) shows that the distinct EGFR mutations can differ markedly
in their inhibitor susceptibilities. A recent study of erlotinib showed it to be more potent against
both the L858R mutant and an exon 19 deletion, but less active against the L861Q mutant
(Carey et al., 2006). Cell-based studies of differential inhibitor sensitivity further highlight the
potential clinical relevance of this issue – the L858R mutant is exquisitely sensitive to erlotinib
and gefitinib, but the exon 20 insertion mutant is not (Greulich et al., 2005). Importantly, our
data show that intrinsic differences in the inhibitor binding affinity of the altered EGFR kinases
can explain the differential sensitivity of cell lines and tumor cells bearing the wild-type, L858R
and G719S proteins. Of course we cannot exclude the possibility that mutation-specific
differences in signaling or other effects in the cellular or tumor milieu may also play a role.
Although the structural divergence in the EGFR mutants may complicate pharmacologic
intervention by “fragmenting” the disease as described above, it may also present an advantage
in that it introduces the possibility of developing inhibitors even more potently selective for
specific mutants over the wild-type EGFR. The therapeutic window for such inhibitors could
in theory be even wider than that of current agents, which were developed to inhibit the wildtype enzyme. Inhibitors designed specifically to target mutants such as L858R should in
principle be less toxic due to reduced inhibition of the wild-type kinase.

Exon 19 deletions and exon 20 insertions account for ~44% and 5%, respectively, of EGFRmutant lung cancers (Shigematsu and Gazdar, 2006). The exon 19 deletions map to one end
of the conformationally sensitive C-helix, the exon 20 insertions to the other; thus these lesions
may also induce the active position of this regulatory element. Structural study of one or more
of each of these mutations will be required to confirm this hypothesis, and to illuminate their
unique inhibitor-binding characteristics.

Development of resistance to TKIs is a major clinical problem. Patients initially responsive to
erlotinib and gefitinib become resistant through second-site mutations in the EGFR kinase,
most notably in the “gatekeeper” residue threonine 790 (Kobayashi et al., 2005;Kwak et al.,
2005;Pao et al., 2005). The T790M mutation in the EGFR is structurally analogous to the T315I
resistance mutation in BCR-Abl, and is expected to sterically interfere with drug binding
(Kobayashi et al., 2005). In gefitinib and AEE788, replacement of threonine with the larger
methionine may impinge on the aniline and phenylethylamine substituents, respectively
(Figures 4A and B). Irreversible inhibitors of the EGFR kinase, including HKI-272, EKB-569
and CL-387785, are reported to maintain activity against the T790M mutation (Kwak et al.,
2005;Kobayashi et al., 2005;Yuza et al., 2006). These compounds are structurally similar to
reversible anilinoquinazoline inhibitors such as gefitinib, but contain a reactive Michaelacceptor that forms a covalent bond with Cys 797 at the edge of the ATP cleft (Tsou et al.,
2005). They are thought to react specifically with this cysteine because their potent binding to
the EGFR –presumably in an orientation analogous to that of gefitinib – brings the reactive
group into apposition with the target thiol of Cys 797. Their potency against the T790M
mutation is therefore somewhat paradoxical, as the T790M substitution can be expected to
clash with their aniline substituents as in other anilinoquinazolines. A better understanding of
the activity of these compounds against the T790M resistance mutant will require structural
and biochemical study of the T790M mutant with these inhibitors. As with rapidly mutating
infectious agents such as the human immunodeficiency virus, a successful strategy to counter
resistance mutations that emerge in the course of cancer chemotherapy with EGFR inhibitors
may involve simultaneous treatment with inhibitors that have different susceptibilities to
resistance mutations. The irreversible inhibitors noted above may offer promise in this respect.
However, the close correspondence in the overall binding modes of the inhibitors studied here
highlights the potential need for development of structurally diverse EGFR inhibitors that may
differ more in their susceptibilities to resistance mutations.

Cloning, expression and purification of EGFR kinase domain—Constructs spanning
residues 696–1022 of the human EGFR and bearing the wild-type sequence, or the L858R or
G719S mutations were prepared as previously described (Greulich et al., 2005) and were
expressed as GST-fusion proteins in Sf9 insect cells using the Baculogold system
(Pharmingen).
Cells pellets were lysed by sonication in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) supplemented with 2 mM
TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride) and complete protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche). After centrifugation (40000 g, 1 hour, 4°C), the supernatant was incubated with
glutathione Sepharose beads (Amersham). The beads were washed with wash buffer (40mM
Tris, 500mM NaCl, 1% Glycerol, 2mM TCEP, pH8.0) and then incubated overnight with 4mL
wash buffer supplemented with 10 μL of 3 mg/mL α-thrombin to remove the GST-fusion. The
eluted EGFR kinases were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200)
in wash buffer, were concentrated to 4mg/ml, and aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −80°C.

Crystallization, diffraction data collection, structure determination and
refinement—All crystals were obtained by hanging-drop method. Well-ordered crystals of
the L858R mutant were only obtained in 40% PEG400, 150mM NaCl, 0.1M Hepes pH8.0,
5mM TCEP, 0.1M NDSB-211 (referred as PEG buffer), while the wild-type and G719S
proteins produced the best crystals in 1.2M Potassium Sodium Tartrate, 0.1M Hepes pH7.5,
5mM TCEP (referred to as tartrate buffer), but could also be crystallized in PEG buffer.
Complex crystals were made by soaking crystals of the wild-type or mutant kinases in either
PEG buffer or tartrate buffer (as indicated in Table 1) containing 400 μM inhibitor overnight.
Analysis of wild-type crystals revealed that crystallization and/or soaking of crystals in PEG
rather than tartrate buffer produces small conformational differences in some loop regions of
the kinase, and induced disorder in residues 867–875 in the activation loop. These bufferrelated differences do not appear to be relevant to inhibitor binding. Nevertheless, we compare
structures obtained under identical conditions when possible. All crystals belong to space group
I23 with unit cell parameters a=b=c≈145Å, α=β=γ=90º.

Diffraction data were collected at the Brookhaven NSLS X25 or X29 beamlines or at Argonne
National Laboratory APS ID19 or ID24 beamlines at 100K. The data were processed with
HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). All structures were solved by molecular
replacement with PHASER (Read, 2001) using the approximately isomorphous apo-EGFR
structure as the search model (PDB code 1M14 or 1M17) (Stamos et al., 2002). The programs
Arp/Warp (Perrakis et al., 1999) and CNS (Brünger et al., 1998) were then used to obtain less
biased 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps for manual inspection and adjustment of the model. Repeated
rounds of manual refitting and crystallographic refinement were performed using O(Jones et
al., 1991), COOT(Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and refmac5(Murshudov et al., 1997). Inhibitors
were modeled into the closely fitting positive Fo-Fc electron density and then included in
following refinement and fitting cycles. Topology and parameter files for the inhibitors were
generated using PRODRG (Schuttelkopf and van Aalten, 2004).
Enzyme kinetic assays and data analysis—The ATP/NADH coupled assay system in
a 96-well format was used to determine the initial velocity of EGFR tyrosine kinase catalyzed
peptide phosphorylation (Barker et al., 1995). The reaction mixture contained 5mg/mL BSA,
2mM MnCl2, 1mM PEP (2-(Phosphonooxy)-2-propenoic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. P-7002),
1mM TCEP, 0.1M MOPS 7.5, fixed (to determine ATP kinetic parameters) or varied (to
determine peptide kinetic parameters) concentration of peptide substrate, 1/50 of the final
reaction mixture volume of PK/LDH enzyme (Pyruvate Kinase/Lactic Dehydrogenase

enzymes from rabbit muscle, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. P-0294), 0.5mM NADH and 1 μM EGFRK,
and ATP was added last to start the reaction. The two substrate kinase reaction was simplified
to two one substrate reactions to determine ATP kinetic parameters and peptide parameters
separately. When determining ATP parameters, the peptide concentration was kept the same
and in excess (more than 5 times the Km value). When determining peptide kinetic parameters
the ATP concentration was kept the same and in excess in all reactions (more than 5 times as
its Km value). Steady state initial velocity data were drawn from the slopes of the A340 curves
and fit to the Michaelis-Menten Equation to determine Vm and Km values. The substrate peptide
was either a synthetic peptide with the sequence RAHEEIYHFFFAKKK (Brignola et al.,
2002;Wood et al., 2004) or the widely used tyrosine kinase substrate poly-[Glu4Tyr1] as
indicated in Table 2. Due to the limited solubility of the synthetic peptide in the coupled enzyme
assay system, we used poly-[Glu4Tyr1] as a peptide substrate in determining peptide kinetic
parameters. To assure that our derived kcat parameters reflected concentrations of active
enzyme, we treated parallel aliquots of the wild-type and mutant kinases with the EGFRspecific covalent inhibitor PD168393 (Fry et al., 1998) to determine the fraction of catalytically
competent molecules. Mass spectrometry analysis of the each sample showed essentially
complete labeling with this ATP-competitive compound, thus our Kcat values are based on
100% competent enzyme.

Binding constant assay and data analysis—The inhibitors and kinases were separately
diluted to 10μM and 50nM respectively in fluorescence buffer containing 20mM Tris, 0.5%
Glycerol, 250mM NaCl, 1mM TCEP. The buffer was degassed and aerated with pure nitrogen
gas to remove dissolved oxygen. The assay was carried out on a FluoroMax-2 fluorometer
using a 1.0 cm pathlength quartz cuvette with micro stirrer. Excitation and emission slits were
set to 3nM and 5nM respectively. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 284nm and
341nm, respectively. The inhibitor solution was titrated into an aliquot of 2.5mL EGFR kinase
solution in the cuvette to obtain the indicated total concentration (total volume increase was
<200 μl). The emission fluorescence intensity was read 25s after addition of inhibitor and the
average of 5 measurements was recorded. A blank assay was performed in exactly the same
manner except that the buffer without inhibitor was used for the titration. Dissociation constants
(Kd) were determined by non-linear fitting of the fluorescence data using a modified static
quenching model (see supplementary information for details).

Structure and activity of mutant EGFR kinases. (A) Overview of the structure of the EGFR
kinase. The structure of the wild-type kinase is shown in complex with the ATP analog AMPPNP. The locations of the L858R and G719S mutations in the activation loop (A-loop) and Ploop, respectively, are indicated. Dashed lines indicate short segments of the activation loop
and C-terminal tail that are disordered in the structures reported here. Due to a difference in
crystallization buffers, we observe more of the C-terminal tail than reported previously (Stamos
et al., 2002), allowing us to confirm that it makes an intra- rather than inter- molecular
interaction with the N-lobe of the kinase in a manner similar to that described for the inactive
kinase (Wood et al., 2004). (B) The structure of the active site region of the L858R mutant

Comparison of the activity of the wild-type, G719S and L858R kinases. The fold activity of
wild-type and mutant enzymes was calculated by determining the kcat for each protein with
saturating ATP and poly-[Glu4Tyr1] as peptide substrate and dividing by the kcat for the wildtype enzyme.

Mechanism of activation of the L858R and G719S mutants. The structure of the inactive, wildtype enzyme in complex with lapatinib (panel A) is compared with that of the active, L858R
mutant in complex with gefitinib (panel B). (A) In the inactive state, the N-terminal portion of
the activation loop (shown in orange) forms a short helix that displaces the regulatory C-helix
from the active site. A cluster of hydrophobic residues (shown in yellow), including Leu 858
(red), stabilize the inactive conformation. Lapatinib (shown as CPK spheres) extends into the
space created by the displaced C-helix and appears to have allowed “trapping” of the inactive
conformation in the crystal structure. Substitution of Leu858 with arginine is expected to
destabilize this conformation, as arginine cannot be favorably accommodated in the
hydrophobic pocket occupied by Leu858. Similarly, substitution of G719S with serine may
destabilize the inactive conformation of the P-loop (which has a conformation favoring glycine
at this position), and therefore activate the kinase. (B) In the active conformation, the activation
loop (orange) is reorganized and the C-helix rotates into its active position. Note that the
hydrophobic cluster (yellow) is dismantled, and Arg858 (red) is readily accomodated (see also
Fig. 1B). Also, note the difference in conformation of the P-loop (purple) and orientation of
Phe 723 in the inactive vs. active structures.

Drug binding modes in the wild-type and mutant EGFR kinase. The binding modes of gefitinib
(panels A, C and E) and AEE788 (panels B, D and F) are compared in the wild-type (yellow),
L858R (green), and G719S (blue) kinases. Key sidechains are labeled, the inhibitors are shown
in stick form with carbons colored yellow, and hydrogen bonds are indicated with dashed lines.
Compare binding of different inhibitors to the same mutant within rows, and binding of the
same inhibitor among wild-type and mutants within columns. Binding modes of both
compounds are essentially the same in all three structures. Note also the closely corresponding
orientations of the pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold in the AEE788 complexes and the quinazoline
