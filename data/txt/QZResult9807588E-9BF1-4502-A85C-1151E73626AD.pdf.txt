Abstract
Anti-angiogenic therapies were approved for different cancers. However,
significant primary and secondary resistance hampers efficacy in several tumor types
including breast cancer. Thus, we need to develop clinically applicable strategies to
enhance efficacy of anti-angiogenic drugs.
We report that anti-angiogenic therapies can induce upregulation of
cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and of its product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in breast cancer
models. Upon Cox-2 inhibition PGE2 levels were normalized and efficacy of antivascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (anti-VEGFR-2) antibodies and sunitinib
was enhanced. Interestingly, both treatments exerted additive anti-angiogenic
effects. Following Cox-2 inhibition, we observed reduced infiltration of tumors with
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and lower levels of pro-angiogenic factors active
besides the VEGF axis including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and basic fibroblast
growth factor (FGF2). Mechanistic studies indicated that Cox-2 inhibition reduced
PGE2-induced migration and proliferation of CAFs via inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt.
Hence, Cox-2 inhibition can increase efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatments and
our findings might pave the road for clinical investigations of concomitant blockade
of Cox-2 and VEGF-signaling.

Introduction

the treatment of different cancers either as single agents
or in combination with standard chemotherapy [5-7].
Bevacizumab showed clinical efficacy in various advanced
common cancers including colorectal cancer, lung cancer,
ovarian cancer and renal cancer [5, 7, 8]. In metastatic
breast cancer, bevacizumab was approved in 2004, but
this approval was revoked in 2011 in the USA due to
relatively low clinical activity at the expense of significant
side effects [9]. VEGF-directed TKIs have proven
largely ineffective in breast cancer [10]. Interestingly,
ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGFR-2

Tumor angiogenesis represents an important
hallmark of cancer [1, 2]. Thus, significant efforts
were made in the past 20 years to develop monoclonal
antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), which are mainly targeting the VEGF pathway
because this pathway was considered indispensable for
tumor neovascularization [3-5]. These VEGF (receptor)
inhibitors (VEGF(R)Is) include bevacizumab, aflibercept,
sunitinib, pazopanib and sorafenib and were approved for

represents a promising new anti-angiogenic agent because
it was recently shown to prolong survival in gastric cancer
as a single agent as well as in combination with paclitaxel,
a tumor type in which other anti-angiogenic drugs had
failed so far [11]. However, in patients with metastatic
breast cancer a large phase III trial with chemotherapy
plus ramucirumab did not meet its endpoint [12]. Since
breast cancer represents the most common cause of
cancer-related death in women and seems rather resistant
against different anti-angiogenic drugs, novel strategies to
improve the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy in breast
cancer resistance are urgently warranted. The possibility
to increase efficacy of anti-angiogenic drugs at lower than
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) levels of anti-angiogenic
drugs would also be desirable, because their side effects
often require dose reductions in cancer patients [13].
Efficacy of VEGF(R)Is is limited by complex
primary and evasive resistance mechanisms many of
which are mediated by tumor-infiltrating stroma cells
[6, 14, 15]. Within the diverse tumor stroma, CAFs and
myeloid cells including myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
are key players mediating anti-angiogenic therapy
resistance [6, 14-16]. Mechanistically, stroma cells can
mediate resistance by secreting pro-angiogenic or prolymphangiogenic mediators besides the VEGF-axis and by
suppressing the host anti-tumor immune response amongst
other mechanisms [17].
Anti-angiogenic therapies elicit hypoxia in different
pre-clinical cancer models, which is considered an
important driving force of stroma-mediated resistance
[18-20]. Thus, hypoxia-induced targets may be useful
to overcome anti-angiogenic therapy resistance.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) levels are upregulated in
hypoxic conditions [21, 22] and can induce angiogenesis
via mechanisms distinct from the VEGF axis [23]. It
was demonstrated that different Cox-2 inhibitors reduce
tumorigenesis and tumor progression. For instance,
celecoxib significantly decreased the incidence of
mammary tumors in MMTV/neu mice [24] and also
lowered metastasis to the lung in a murine mammary
cancer model [25]. In addition SC-236 and indomethacin
inhibited angiogenesis by reducing VEGF levels in 4T1
tumors [26]. Therefore, we hypothesized that Cox-2
inhibitors might be useful to increase efficacy of antiangiogenic drugs in experimental breast cancer by
targeting a pro-angiogenic pathway distinct from VEGF
inhibitors.

Anti-angiogenic therapies increase Cox-2
expression and PGE2 levels in breast cancer
In a first step, we wished to investigate whether
anti-angiogenic therapies modulate Cox-2 expression in
experimental breast cancer. In order to model available
treatments, we chose anti-mouse VEGFR-2 antibodies
(DC101) and the pan-VEGFR inhibitor sunitinib.
We analyzed mRNA expression levels of Cox-2 in
GFP+ tumor cells, which were FACS-sorted from endstage 4T1 tumors after treatment with DC101 or with
sunitinib (Figure 1A and B). These experiments revealed
that Cox-2 mRNA was upregulated 2.5 and 2.3-fold,
respectively. This upregulation occurred at standard dose
levels of 40 - 60 mg/kg sunitinib [27, 28], while it was
not present or not significant at lower dose levels of 10
- 20 mg/kg (Figure 1C and D and data not shown). In
order to analyze whether increased expression of Cox-2
had functional consequences we subsequently determined
prostaglandin (PGE2) levels and found that they were
enhanced 1.7-fold in 4T1 tumors after anti-angiogenic
therapy with 40 mg/kg DC101 and 5.2-fold after treatment
with 60 mg/kg sunitinib (Figure 1E and F). As Cox-2 can
be induced by hypoxia [29] we subsequently quantified
hypoxia in control-treated and tumors treated with 60
mg/kg sunitinib. Consistent with published, data antiangiogenic therapy led to an increase in intra-tumoral
hypoxia. The induction of hypoxia was not significantly
different between 40 mg/kg sunitinib and 40 mg/kg DC101
(Figure 1G and data not shown). Interestingly, PGE2 levels
correlated with hypoxia (r = 0.81, p = 0.0058) (Figure
1G and H). These data indicate that treatment-induced
hypoxia could be responsible for increased intratumoral
PGE2 levels. Altogether, anti-angiogenic therapies can
induce expression of Cox-2 and PGE2 in breast cancer at
standard dose levels.

Cox-2 inhibition decreases breast cancer growth
as monotherapy and exerts additive effects in
combination with anti-angiogenic therapies
We hypothesized that (enhanced) Cox-2 expression
could decrease the response of breast cancer to antiangiogenic therapies and thus concomitant blockade of
Cox-2 would increase their efficacy. Therefore, we treated
4T1 tumor-bearing mice with 60 mg/kg sunitinib alone and
in combination with the pan-Cox inhibitor acetylsalicylic
acid (ASA). We found that single treatment with ASA or
angiogenesis inhibitors inhibited tumor growth and that
combined inhibition of Cox-2 and VEGF(R) signaling
exerted additive therapeutic efficacy at standard dose
levels (Figure 2A). Consistently, intratumoral PGE2 levels,

which were increased upon anti-angiogenic therapy, could
be normalized by concomitant ASA treatment (Figure 2B).
Interestingly, also the combination of intermediate
(20 mg/kg) and low doses (10 mg/kg) of sunitinib or
DC101 (15 mg/kg) and ASA showed additive effects
(Figure 2C-E). A comparison between the tumor growth
kinetics revealed that there was no significant difference
between 40 mg/kg sunitinib and 20 mg/kg sunitinib
combined with 25 mg/kg ASA (Supplementary Figure 5).
At these dose levels of sunitinib or DC101 we did
not observe induction of Cox-2 and PGE2 (see previous
section), thus the mechanism underlying the additive effect
of both treatments is most likely different between high
and low doses of anti-angiogenic therapies. As ASA can
induce downregulation of Cox-2 gene expression [30] we
hypothesized that reduced Cox-2 expression levels could

mediate additive anti-tumor effects of low/intermediate
doses of sunitinib and ASA. Indeed, morphometric
quantification of Cox-2 protein in tumor sections indicated
a reduction of Cox-2 expression upon treatment with
ASA, while its expression was unchanged upon treatment
with 20 mg/kg sunitinib (Figure 2F and G). These data
are consistent with the observed reduction of PGE2 levels
upon treatment with ASA monotherapy (Figure 2B).
In order to rule out that additive effects of Cox-2
inhibition and anti-angiogenic therapy only occur in a
single breast cancer model and might therefore not be
representative we treated 66cl4 tumor-bearing mice with
ASA and sunitinib. Similar to our observations in the
4T1 model we found efficacy of single treatments and
an additive effect of ASA and anti-angiogenic treatment
(Figure 2H). Thus, the ability of ASA to enhance efficacy

Cox-2 inhibition and anti-angiogenic therapies
exert additive anti-angiogenic effects

of anti-angiogenic treatment is present in different breast
cancer models.
Next, we wished to determine whether the observed
effect is specifically due to Cox-2 inhibition and therefore
treated 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with sunitinib and the
specific Cox-2 inhibitor SC-236. In these experiments
we also observed an additive effect of combined Cox-2
inhibition and anti-angiogenic therapy (Figure 2I). In
conclusion, pan-Cox or specific Cox-2 inhibition increases
efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy at different dose-levels
in different breast cancer models. For further analyses of
the tumor phenotype we chose intermediate doses of antiangiogenic agents (20 mg/kg) and ASA (25 mg/kg).

Previous data indicate that inhibition of Cox-2
can exert additive anti-angiogenic effects independent
from VEGF signaling [23]. Based on these data we
hypothesized that inhibition of Cox-2 and VEGF signaling
could elicit additive anti-angiogenic effects. Indeed,
the density of CD31+ vessels in 4T1 tumors treated
with combined Cox-2 and VEGF blockade was lower
compared to the respective monotherapy (Figure 3AD). Hence, the additive anti-angiogenic effect of VEGF
pathway– and Cox-2 blockade most likely represents a
mechanism underlying the enhanced anti-tumor activity

of both treatments.
Next we wished to investigate whether treatment
with ASA influences important (pro-angiogenic) cellular
components of the tumor microenvironment in order to
elucidate additional mechanisms underlying the antiangiogenic effect of ASA.

angiogenic agents revealed a 3.4-fold reduction of CAFs
upon treatment with ASA alone. Sunitinib monotherapy
also reduced CAF infiltration and both treatments in
combination resulted in an additive reduction of CAFs
(Figure 4A and B). In contrast, DC101 did not significantly
reduce infiltration of tumors with CAFs (Supplementary
Figure S1A and B). Next, we determined numbers of
vimentin+α-SMA+ activated CAFs which revealed that
ASA, but not sunitinib at a dose of 20 mg/kg or DC101,
reduced the fraction of activated CAFs within the total
population of CAFs (Figure 4C and D; Supplementary
Figure 1C and D). Higher doses of sunitinib monotherapy
(40 and 60 mg/kg) could reduce both tumor infiltration and
activation of CAFs (Supplementary Figure S2A and B).
In order to confirm the link between Cox-2
inhibition and activation of fibroblasts we investigated the
influence of Cox-2 inhibitors on the activation of CAFs
isolated from tumor tissue of n=2 lung cancer patients
in vitro. We incubated CAFs in the presence of ASA or
SC-263. Subsequently, we measured the well-described
CAF activation markers α-SMA and fibroblast activation
protein (FAP) by qRT-PCR [35]. These experiments

Cox-2 inhibition and anti-angiogenic therapies
reduce tumor infiltration with (activated) cancerassociated fibroblasts
Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote tumor
angiogenesis by secreting a plethora of pro-angiogenic
mediators, which can not be inhibited by VEGF pathway
blockers [31, 32] and can therefore be considered as key
stromal element mediating resistance to these agents. It is
known that Cox-2 inhibition can affect the proliferative
state of fibroblasts in vitro [33]. Therefore, we
hypothesized that ASA treatment could influence numbers
of tumor-infiltrating CAFs in principle. Interestingly,
histomorphometric analyses of total vimentin+ CAFs [34]
in tumor tissues treated by ASA with or without anti-

effect is observed when DC101 is combined with ASA (n = 7; *P < 0.0001) (C and D). Representative pictures of CD31-stained tumor

revealed decreased activation of CAFs in the presence of
Cox-2 inhibitors (Figure 5A and B).
Thus, sunitinib and ASA exert additive effects in
reducing the total number of CAFs but ASA could also
decrease their activation in vitro and in vivo. DC101 did
not reduce infiltration of tumor with CAFs. It is well
known that activated CAFs secrete higher levels of proangiogenic cytokines compared to non-activated CAFs
[32, 36, 37]. Thus, we hypothesized that treatment with
ASA could lead to decreased levels of pro-angiogenic
factors in the tumor tissue.

sunitinib and/or ASA by qRT-PCR: transforming growth
factor beta (TGFβ), fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1),
basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), interleukin 6 (IL-6)
and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [36-38]. Importantly,
all of these mediators cannot be blocked with VEGF
pathway inhibitors [39]. In addition, it was demonstrated
that FGF2 mediates resistance of endothelial cells towards
sunitinib [40]. Furthermore, we determined expression
levels of VEGF mRNA because Cox-2 inhibitors can
reduce expression of this cytokine in tumors [41, 42].
These analyses revealed that TGFβ, FGF2, IL-6 and HGF
were reduced upon combination of ASA and sunitinib
treatments (Figure 5C-F). Some of these mediators,
including TGFβ, HGF and IL-6, were reduced by single
ASA treatment and showed an additive reduction in the
combination group (Figure 5C and F). VEGF mRNA
expression levels were not (significantly) reduced by
ASA or SC-236 (Figure 5G-I). Higher doses of sunitinib
(60 mg/kg) decreased mRNA levels of FGF-2 and TGFβ

Tumors treated with ASA and sunitinib contain
less pro-angiogenic cytokines aside the VEGF axis
Therefore, we next determined expression levels of
the following cytokines capable to promote angiogenesis
in cDNA prepared from tumor tissues treated with

(A and B). Quantification of vimentin+α-Sma+ CAFs reveals a reduction in the fraction of activated CAFs upon ASA treatment (n = 7; *P

while IL-6 and HGF mRNA levels were not significantly
lowered (Supplementary Figure S2C-F).
Thus, sunitinib alone can decrease FGF2 and
TGFβ mRNA expression levels when applied at higher
concentrations while it seems to have less effects on
intratumoral IL-6 and HGF mRNA expression.
Our data indicate that combined treatment with ASA
and sunitinib leads to lower levels of TGFβ, FGF-2, HGF
and IL-6 all of which are capable to promote angiogenesis
in presence of VEGF(R)Is.
Next, we FACS-sorted important cellular
constituents of untreated tumors including tumor
cells, CAFs, endothelial cells (ECs), tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs), granulocytic myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (gMDSCs) and monocytic MDSCs
(mMDSCs) in order to analyze possible sources of
these cytokines. Here, we found that HGF mRNA was
predominantly expressed by CAFs and ECs while IL-6

mRNA was mainly expressed by tumor cells and by CAFs.
FGF-2 and TGFβ were expressed by a wider range of cell
types including TAMs and MDSCs (Figure 6A-D). Hence,
the observed reductions of TGFβ, FGF2, IL-6 and HGF
can not only be due to the reduction of tumor-infiltrating
CAFs but also due to quantitative and/or qualitative
changes in other intratumoral cell populations such as
reduced numbers of ECs due to an anti-angiogenic effect
of the treatments.

Cox-2 inhibition blocks proliferation of CAFs in
vitro and in vivo
Reduced numbers of tumor-infiltrating CAFs could
be due to decreased proliferation, recruitment and/or
migration of CAFs.
First, we investigated effects of Cox-2 and PGE2

on proliferation of CAFs isolated from tumor tissue
of lung cancer patients and of the embryonic fibroblast
cell line MRC-5 in vitro. We incubated CAFs or MRC-5
cells with PGE2 and ASA or SC-263. These experiments
revealed induction of CAF proliferation by PGE2, which
was counteracted by Cox-2 inhibition (Figure 7A and data
not shown). Interestingly, monotherapy with ASA or SC263 also inhibited CAF proliferation compared to control
(Figure 7A and data not shown).
Published data indicate that Cox-2 inhibitors can
reduce Cox-2 levels in tumor cells leading to decreased
secretion of PGE2 and thereby influencing the proliferative
state of the cells [43]. qRT-PCRs revealed that Cox2 mRNA levels were reduced in CAFs upon treatment
with Cox-2 inhibitors (Figure 7B). Consistently, ELISAs
performed with cell culture supernatants revealed that
CAFs secreted less PGE2 upon treatment with Cox-2
inhibitors (Figure 7C).
Based on these findings we hypothesized that
reduced Cox-2 and PGE2 levels could lead to lower
activity of the Akt and MapK pathways, both of which
can be activated by PGE2 and mediate proliferation [43,

44]. Western Blot analyses of phosphorylated signal
transduction intermediates revealed that phosphorylation
of Erk was not influenced by PGE2 or Cox-2 inhibitors
in CAFs (data not shown). In contrast, phosphorylation
of Akt could be induced by PGE2 and was reduced upon
Cox-2 inhibition (Figure 7D). Thus, the Cox-2 PGE2 axis
could influence the proliferative state of CAFs via Akt.
In order to test this hypothesis we incubated CAFs with
PGE2, ASA and the well-described Akt inhibitor MK2206 at a dose level showing almost complete inhibition
of Akt phosphorylation (Figure 7D and Supplementary
Figure 3A) [45]. These experiments showed that both the
Akt inhibitor and ASA inhibited fibroblast proliferation
when given alone and in combination with PGE2 (Figure
7E). However, when ASA and the Akt inhibitor were
combined there was no additive effect of both treatments
when incubated with or without PGE2 (Figure 7E). These
findings indicate that the anti-proliferative effect of Cox-2
inhibition was mediated mainly by Akt signaling, because
if Cox-2 inhibition would inhibit other pro-proliferative
pathways one would expect an additive effect of Cox2 and
Akt inhibition (Figure 7E).

The inhibitory effect of ASA on CAF proliferation
was validated in vivo by performing morphometric
analyses of BrdU+ CAFs in tumor sections treated with
ASA. These analyses indicated reduced proliferation of
CAFs upon treatment with ASA therapy (Figure 7F and
G). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of ASA on CAF
proliferation was preserved in the combination group and
could at least partly explain the reduced numbers of CAFs
upon treatment with ASA (Figure 4A and B).

tumor tissues we quantified mRNA expression of TGFβ,
interleukin 1β (IL1β), C-X-C motif chemokine 12
(CXCL12) also called SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor
1), and platelet derived growth factor D (PDGF-D) [38,
46, 47] in tumors treated with ASA and sunitinib. These
experiments indicated that ASA reduced expression of
TGFβ and PDGF-D both alone and in combination with
sunitinib (Figures 5C and 8A) while expression levels
of IL1β and CXCL12 mRNA were unchanged (data not
shown).
Subsequently, we analyzed how Cox-2 and
PGE2 influence migration of patient-derived CAFs by
performing boyden chamber experiments. We found
that migration of CAFs could be induced by PGE2 while
it was inhibited by Cox-2 inhibitors (Figure 8B and

Cox-2 inhibition blocks migration of CAFs
In order to explore if Cox-2 inhibition influences
known mediators involved in CAF recruitment into

Supplementary Figure S4). Importantly, ASA and SC-236
blocked PGE2-induced migration of CAFs to similar levels
as observed in the control (Figure 8B).
Previous work documents that Akt signaling
can promote migration of CAFs [48]. Thus, we were
interested to determine whether the inhibitory effect of
Cox-2 inhibitors on CAF migration was mediated via Akt.
Therefore, in a similar experimental setup as described
above we incubated CAFs with PGE2, Cox-2 inhibitors
and MK-2206 both alone and in combination. Similar to
our findings with regards to proliferation we found no
additive reduction of CAF migration upon combining
Cox-2 and Akt inhibition with and without PGE2 (Figure
8C). These data indicate that reduced CAF migration upon
treatment with Cox-2 inhibitors is mainly mediated via
Akt signaling.
Altogether, the reduction of intratumoral CAFs
upon treatment with ASA can be explained by reduced
recruitment/migration and by reduced proliferation (Figure
8D).

effects occur at standard but also at lower than typical
therapeutic dose levels of anti-angiogenic drugs; (iii) antiangiogenic drugs and Cox-2 inhibitors induce additive
anti-angiogenic effects; (iv) ASA and high doses of
sunitinib can block infiltration of tumors with activated
CAFs; (v) treatment with ASA leads to decreased levels
of intratumoral pro-angiogenic cytokines IL-6 and HGF
which are not significantly modulated by sunitinib and
(vi) Cox-2 inhibitors reduce proliferation and migration
of CAFs via interfering with Akt signaling.
Our preclinical findings indicate that upregulation
of Cox-2 and PGE2 occurs at standard dose levels of antiangiogenic drugs. This upregulation is correlated with
intra-tumoral hypoxia. The PGE2 upregulation appears
to be more pronounced upon treatment with sunitinib
compared to DC101 despite similar induction of Cox-2
mRNA upon both treatments. DC101 and sunitinib induce
comparable level of intratumoral hypoxia. However,
Cox-2 mRNA levels might not fully reflect the amount
of the end product PGE2 because different mechanisms
for regulation of Cox-2 enzymatic activity including
protein degradation, allosteric regulation and protein
phosphorylation were already described [49-51].
A large body of evidence in literature indicates
that anti-angiogenic drugs at standard dose levels induce
tumor hypoxia, which is considered a main driving

Interestingly, in our study Cox-2 blockade and antiangiogenic therapy also exerted additive anti-angiogenic
effects at low doses of VEGF blockers at which PGE2
levels were not increased.
In order to analyze possible reasons for the
additive anti-tumor effect at lower dose levels of antiangiogenic drugs we carried out a profiling of the tumor
microenvironment. We found that CAFs were reduced
upon Cox-2 blockade and upon treatment with sunitinib.
In addition, combinatorial treatments exerted additive
effects on CAF reduction leading to an approximately
90% decrease in the number of tumor-infiltrating CAFs.
ASA and higher dose levels of sunitinib (40 mg/kg and
60 mg/kg) could in addition reduce CAF-activation
when applied as monotherapies. This inhibition of CAF
recruitment and activation could be due to the inhibitory
activity of sunitinib on PDGFR. A link between inhibition
of PDGFR by imatinib was already demonstrated in CAFs
isolated from colorectal metastases [59].
Anti-angiogenic agents can evoke side effects
including deterioration of the patients quality of life [60].
Therefore, it would be of clinical interest to maintain/
increase efficacy at lower dose levels. For instance, 40
mg/kg/d of sunitinib in a mouse already corresponds to
the MTD of 75 mg/d of the drug in a patient [61, 62]. Of
note, reductions of this dose level are often required due
to intolerable side effects including nausea, asthenia and
fatigue [63]. Our data indicate that adding 25 mg/kg ASA
(corresponding to a daily dose of 150 mg in humans [64]
to the treatment with a lower dose of sunitinib (20 mg/kg)
exerts similar efficacy compared to monotherapy with 40
mg/kg sunitinib (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure S5).
Thus, combinatorial treatment with ASA might be useful
to decrease the sunitinib dose upfront or to maintain
efficacy in patients requiring dose reductions. Similarly,
it was discussed that the combination of anti-angiogenic
therapy and chemotherapy exert additive anti-angiogenic
effects, which might allow dose reductions of both agents
[58].
We found that ASA could reduce intratumoral levels
of IL-6 and HGF while sunitinib also at higher dose levels
was not significantly lowering expression levels of these
cytokines. Both treatments reduced expression of TGFβ
and FGF2 mRNA. Expression profiling of different
cellular constituents of tumors indicated that HGF mRNA
was predominantly expressed by CAFs and ECs while
IL-6 mRNA was mainly expressed by tumor cells and by
CAFs. FGF-2 and TGFβ were expressed by a wider range
of cell types including TAMs and MDSCs. Hence, the
observed reductions of TGFβ, FGF2, IL-6 and HGF can
not only be due to the reduction of tumor-infiltrating CAFs
but also due to quantitative and/or qualitative changes
in other intratumoral cell populations such as reduced
numbers of ECs due to an anti-angiogenic effect of the
treatments.
IL-6 and HGF were both shown to be capable to

force of anti-angiogenic therapy resistance [15, 52].
However, traditionally, drug doses used in mice and in
humans are rather high, due to the long-lasting concept
in oncology to treat patients with the maximum tolerated
doses of drugs. This strategy might be counterproductive
in the case of anti-angiogenic drugs (and possibly
also other targeted agents). Clinical data also indicate
that anti-angiogenic drugs induce hypoxia in tumor
tissue of cancer patients [53]. Hypoxia can induce a
plethora of resistance mechanisms including induction
of pro-angiogenic cytokines besides the VEGF-axis or
enhancement of cancer stem cell-like properties [54].
Our data indicate that combined inhibition of Cox-2 and
anti-angiogenic treatments exert additive therapeutic
effects. One might speculate that upregulation of Cox2 and PGE2 might contribute to resistance against antiangiogenic drugs which occur at standard (high) dose
levels in an experimental breast cancer model. In line with
this concept concomitant inhibition of Cox-2 increased
efficacy of anti-angiogenic drugs. Prostaglandines and
especially PGE2 can promote angiogenesis by different
mechanisms besides the VEGF axis. PGE2 can bind
directly to endothelial E-prostane surface receptors
thereby enhancing endothelial cell migration, survival
and proliferation [23]. In addition, Cox-2 is important for
induction of FGF2-induced pro-angiogenic signals which
are known to confer resistance to sunitinib [40]. Thus, the
pro-angiogenic effect of Cox-2 is at least partly mediated
by mechanisms which are distinct from the pro-angiogenic
effect exerted via VEGF and its receptors. This alternative
pro-angiogenic pathway would be inhibited by decreased
Cox-2 expression and PGE2 levels and could hence be
responsible for improved efficacy of anti-angiogenic
treatments. In line with this concept we could detect an
additive anti-angiogenic effect upon combined blockade of
the VEGF pathway and Cox-2. A similar connection exists
for other cytokines including placental growth factor and
FGF family members that are upregulated upon hypoxia
elicited by VEGF inhibitors [55, 56]. These mediators
can support angiogenesis upon VEGF-blockade, thereby
contributing to anti-angiogenic therapy resistance (Figure
8D).
Our data are in concordance with published
literature indicating hypoxia-induced upregulation
of Cox-2 in preclinical models of renal cancer upon
treatment with high doses of sunitinib [57]. These data
also indicated additive effects of sunitinib and the Cox2 inhibitor celecoxib [57]. In this previous study tumor
blood perfusion was not inhibited by celecoxib, thus the
authors could not detect additive anti-angiogenic effects
upon concomitant usage of celecoxib and sunitinib
[57]. However, PGE2 levels were not measured and the
underlying mechanism of enhanced efficacy was not
investigated. It is also possible that the mechanism of
action of Cox-2 inhibitors may vary in different cancer
types.

induce angiogenesis in the presence of VEGF inhibitors
and could thus lower the efficacy of anti-angiogenic
agents. This might explain the enhanced treatment efficacy
upon combination of ASA and anti-angiogenic drugs
[65]. Another reason could be that both treatments are
additive because they inhibit different cancer-promoting
pathways. Further work is necessary in order to determine
the underlying mechanisms as both Cox-2 inhibitors and
VEGF(R)Is exert pleiotropic effects on tumor cells and
their microenvironment [66]. Especially sunitinib targets
many different kinases thus our findings could also be
attributed to other mechanisms besides the drug´s effects
on CAFs and ECs. In addition, our results could be
influenced by the triple negative phenotype of the tumor
cells. Further work is necessary to elucidate whether the
observed findings also hold true in hormone receptor and/
or HER2-positive cell lines.
In our tumor models VEGF expression was not
significantly reduced by Cox-2 inhibitors. Therefore, the
observed additive effect of concomitant treatment with
VEGF- and Cox-2 inhibitors is most likely not due to
a reduction of VEGF expression induced by the latter.
However, published literature indicates downregulation
of VEGF mRNA expression in some tumor models
after blockade of Cox-2. Hence, the effect of Cox-2 on
VEGF expression might vary in a context and cell-type
specific manner and further work is necessary in order
to determine the underlying mechanisms. Even though
VEGF-A could be downregulated upon Cox-2 inhibition,
its signaling would be inhibited by the pan-VEGFR
inhibitor sunitinib [67]. Thus, it appears rather unlikely
that a downregulation of VEGF-A upon Cox-2 inhibition
can be responsible for the additive effects of sunitinib
and Cox-2 blockade. Concerning DC101 it is possible
that due to decreased VEGF-A levels the pro-angiogenic
signaling via VEGFR-1 could be reduced. However, the
pro-angiogenic signal transmitted by VEGFR-1 is about
7-fold weaker compared to VEGFR-2 [68] and thus it
might not be sufficient to explain the phenotype.
The observed reduction of CAFs could be explained
by their decreased proliferation and/or migration.
In vitro assays indicated that PGE2 increased CAF
proliferation and migration, which can be inhibited
by Cox-2 blockers. Importantly, these drugs can also
decrease CAF proliferation and migration in baseline
conditions indicating that this process does not require
PGE2 induction. Upon analysis of candidate molecular
mechanisms involved in CAF proliferation and migration
we found that phosphorylation of Akt but not Erk
was inhibited by Cox-2 blockade. In addition, Cox-2
inhibition and Akt blockade did not exert additive effects
on proliferation or migration indicating that the effect of
Cox-2 inhibition on proliferation is mainly mediated by
interfering with Akt signaling.
In concordance with published literature the
decreased Akt phosphorylation could at least partially
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

explain the reduced CAF proliferation and migration [48].
The finding that Cox-2 inhibitors reduce CAF proliferation
by interfering with Akt signaling is novel. Available
literature indicates that Cox-2 inhibitors induce rather
than inhibit the proliferation of other types of fibroblasts
including lung fibroblasts [69]. Hence, the effect of Cox-2
inhibition on fibroblasts seems to be context-dependent.
Further work is necessary in order to determine the effect
of Cox-2 inhibitors on CAFs in other tumor types besides
breast cancer. In addition, we found that TGFβ and platelet
derived growth factor B (PDGF-B), both of which are
capable to induce recruitment of CAFs were reduced upon
treatment with Cox-2 inhibitors.
In summary, concomitant anti-angiogenic therapy
and Cox-2 blockade represents a novel clinically
applicable approach to increase efficacy of anti-angiogenic
drugs at high and low dose levels. These findings may also
have significant implications for further clinical trials in
breast cancer and possibly in other cancer types where
anti-angiogenic approaches are used.

Materials and Methods
Animals
8 weeks old female Balb/C mice were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories International (Sulzfeld,
Germany). All animal experiments were carried out
according to the institutional guidelines for the welfare
of animals in experimental neoplasia and were approved
by the local licensing authority (Behörde für Soziales,
Familie, Gesundheit, Verbraucherschutz; Amt für
Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz, Hamburg, Germany,
project number 98/10). Housing, breeding and experiments
were performed under a 12h light – 12h dark cycle and
standard laboratory conditions (22 ± 1°C, 55% humidity,
food and water ad libitum and 150–400 lx light intensity
during the light phase).

Reagents
ASA or aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) was purchased
from Sigma and diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution with
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The final concentration of
DMSO in the medium was 1/1000 (v/v). The solution was
freshly prepared. SC-236 was purchased from Cayman
Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and was dissolved in
ethanol with phosphate buffered saline pH 7.6 (PBS)
in a 1:4 solution of ethanol:PBS, which was stored
at -20ºC. Sunitinib Malate was obtained from Pfizer
(Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA) and was suspended
in carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution (0.5% CMC,
1.8% NaCl, 0.4% Tween 80, and 0.9% benzyl alcohol
in distilled water) for in vivo experiments. Drug aliquots

were prepared once weekly and kept in the dark at 4ºC.
DC101 was obtained from ImClone Systems (Branchburg,
NJ, USA) and was diluted in PBS. Aliquots were stored
at -20ºC. PGE2 was bought from Cayman Chemical,
dissolved in DMSO and stored at -20ºC. The Akt
inhibitor MK-2206 was purchased from Merck Millipore
(Darmstadt, Germany), dissolved in PBS with 20%
ethanol and stored at -20ºC.

5x105 4T1 or 1x106 66cl4 murine breast cancer
cells (both hormone receptor- and HER2-negative [72,
73]) were orthotopically implanted into the second
mammary gland of syngeneic Balb/C mice. The animals
were randomized according to tumor size after 7-10
days (mean tumor size 80-150 mm3) and were treated
with daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 25 and 100
mg/kg ASA. Treatment was given three times per week
with 1.5 mg/kg SC-236 and 10, 15 or 40 mg/kg DC101
i.p. Sunitinib 10, 20, 40 or 60 mg/kg was administered
by oral gavage once per day. Combinatory treatments
have been carried out as described in the graphs and all
treatments were started on the same day on which both
drugs were administered. Tumor growth was monitored
by calliper. Tumor volume was calculated according to the
formula V=(longer length2 x shorter length)/2. Mice were
sacrificed according to ethical regulations when the first
tumor in the control group reached the maximum allowed
size of 1500 mm3. After sacrification of mice, tumors were
weighed, pieces were embedded in paraffin for further
immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis and fresh tissue
was frozen for protein and RNA extractions.

Cells and culture conditions
The mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 was obtained
from Peter Carmeliet (VIB Vesalius Research Centre,
K.U. Leuven, Belgium) and murine 66cl4 cells were
provided by Dr. Fred Miller (Karmanos Cancer Institute
and Wayne State University, Detroit, MI). They were
cultured in RPMI-1640 and DMEM medium, respectively.
The cell lines were not authenticated by the authors as cell
authentication testing can be conducted only on human
cell lines. Primary CAFs were isolated from tumor tissue
of n=2 lung cancer patients as described [70] (kindly
provided by Iñigo Martinez-Zubiaurre, Arctic University
of Norway, Tromsø, Norway) and cultured in DMEM.
The embryonic fibroblast cell line MRC-5 was cultured in
MEM supplemented with 1% sodium pyruvate. All cells
were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% FCS,
1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S) and 1% L-glutamine
(all cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany).

FACS sorting
4T1 cells were stably transduced with the lentiviral
vector LeGO-G2 expressing enhanced green fluorescent
protein (eGFP) [74] and cells were injected into the
mice as described above. Tumors were resected, cut
into small pieces and digested in 10 ml digestion buffer
(collagenase A and DNase (from Roche)) for 1 hour at
37ºC. A single cell suspension was obtained by mincing
the digested tumor through a 70 µm-pore cell strainer.
The cells were incubated with Fc-block (anti-CD16/32)
from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA) and stained with
the following antibodies: anti-F4/80-APC, anti-CD11bPE-Cy7, anti-Ly6C-PE, anti-Ly6G-PercP 5.5, CD45APC, CD31-PE-Cy7, all purchased from eBioscience
(Frankfurt am Main, Germany), and anti-PDGFRPE from BioLegend. Specificity of antibodies was
determined by using appropriate isotype controls. Dead
cells were excluded from analysis using 7-AAD or DAPI.
Multicolor-flow cytometry was used to sort tumor cells
(GFP+/CD45-), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
(F4/80+/CD11b+), endothelial cells (ECs) (CD31+/CD45-/
GFP-), cancer-associated fibroblast (CAFs) (PDGFR+/
CD45-/GFP-) granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (gMDSCs) (CD11b+/Ly6G+Ly6Clow/-) and monocytic
MDSCs (mMDSCs) (CD11b+/Ly6C+Ly6G-). FACS
sorting was performed on FACS Aria IIIu using the FACS
Diva software version 6.1.3. (both from BD Biosciences
(Bedford, MA, USA)). Sorted cells were recollected
in RNA lysis buffer (Ambion, Life Techonologies,

Treatments
Primary CAFs and MRC-5 cells were starved in
serum-free medium over night followed by treatment with
different reagents. For qRT-PCR and WST-1 assays 1 x 105
or 9 x 103 cells were seeded in 6 well-plates or 96 wellplates, respectively, and incubated for 48 hours in serum
free-medium containing either or a combination of 10 ng/
ml PGE2, 5 mM ASA, 15 μM SC-236 and 7.5 μM Akt
inhibitor. For migration assays 1.1 x 104 cells were seeded
in the migration inserts of 24 well-plates and treated with
10 ng/ml PGE2, 5 mM ASA, 15 μM SC-236 and 7.5 μM
Akt inhibitor for 24 hours in serum free medium. For
western blotting 3 x 106 cells were seeded and incubated
with 10 ng/ml PGE2, 5 mM ASA, 15 μM SC-236, 5 and
7.5 μM Akt inhibitor for 3 hours.

Cell growth
Cell viability was assessed by WST-1 assay (Roche
Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) or by Trypan Blue
exclusion was carried out as previously described [71].

buffer. Incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
and 0.3% tritonX-100 was performed to inhibit unspecific
binding, followed by incubation with antibodies for
CD31 (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) or
Cox-2 (1:500, Abcam) overnight at 4°C. Sections were
then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated
secondary antibodies, followed by incubation with
DAB solution, and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Immunofluorescence staining of CAFs was performed in
paraffin-embedded tissues after deparaffinization, antigen
retrieval and inhibition of unspecific binding sites as
described above. Incubation with 1% BSA in TNT buffer
was performed to permeabilize sections prior to overnight
incubation with antibodies for vimentin (1:500, Abcam)
and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) conjugated
with Cy3 (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich) or vimentin (1:1000,
Novus) and BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) (1:200, AbD
Serotec, Kidlington, United Kingdom) at 4°C. Sections
were then washed with TNT buffer and incubated with
secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor dyes
(1:200, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany and Molecular
Probes distributed through Life Technologies Darmstadt,
Germany) as well as with DAPI to visualize nuclei. The
labeled sections were mounted with glass coverslips on
slides and imaged using a Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 (Carl
Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) for IHC or a Leica
DM5000 B (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) for
immunofluorescence (IF). Image analysis was performed
using the imaging software AxioVision (Carl Zeiss
Microscopy). Manual counting of immunostained cells
in the tumor stroma was performed in 10-12 fields of
each tumor section (20x magnification). Microvessel and
CAF densities were calculated as the number of counted
CD31+ and as α-SMA+ and/or Vimentin+ cells per total
area of analyzed tumor tissue, respectively. Hypoxia was
detected in paraffin sections of tumor tissue by using the
pimonidazole (PIMO) method as described [55]. Pictures
were taken with 10x magnification using an AxioScope.
A1 microscope and Axiovision software. The PIMO+
area was manually assessed after IHC staining and digital
image acquisition. Subsequently, the fraction of PIMO+
area was calculated relative to the total tumor area. Areas
of necrosis were excluded from all analyses.

ELISA
PGE2 levels were determined in tumor lysates
by a commercially available competitive ELISA for
PGE2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Tumors
were mechanically disaggregated in 0.1 M potassium
phosphate buffer containing protease inhibitors prior to
homogenization by sonication. The protein concentration
of tumor lysates was determined by the Bradford protein
assay and a total protein amount of 3 µg was used. PGE2
levels in cell culture supernatants were determined
using a competitive ELISA for PGE2 from Enzo Life
Science (Famingdale, NY, USA). ELISA assays were
performed as described by the manufacturers instructions.
The absorbance was measured by a microplate reader
(Tecan). The PGE2 concentrations were calculated using
a four parameter logistic (4-PL) curve. Each tumor,
supernatant sample and standard was analyzed in triplicate
measurements.

RT-PCR
Total cellular mRNA was extracted from sorted
or cultured cells using the Ambion PureLink® RNA
Mini Kit followed by cDNA synthesis using first strand
cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, distributed
through Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The relative levels of gene expression for each
experimental sample were performed by quantitative realtime RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). mRNA levels of target genes
were quantified using the SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix
and ABI 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems, distributed
through Life Technologies). Expression of GAPDH
served as an endogenous control. All Primers are shown
in Supplemental Table 1 and were synthesized by Eurofins
MWG, Ebersberg, Germany. The relative mRNA levels in
each sample were calculated based on their threshold cycle
(Ct) normalized by their respective Ct value of GAPDH
using the ΔΔCt-method.

Histology and morphometric analysis

Migration assay

Tumors were resected, fixed overnight in 1%
parafolmaldehyde at 4°C and embedded in paraffin.
Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 4µm,
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series
of graded ethanol to distilled water. Antigen retrieval was
performed in citrate buffer (Dako, distributed through
Agilent Technologies, Glostrup, Denmark) using a
steamer. After cooling to room temperature, sections were
incubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to inactivate
endogenous peroxidases followed by washes with TBS

The kit BD BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers
(BD Biosciences) was used. To assess, cellular migration
inserts without matrigel (8 µm pore size) were utilized. 1.1
x 104 cells were seeded onto the inserts containing 400 µl
of serum-free medium. The insert was placed in a 24-well
plate and 400 µl of serum free medium were added to the
bottom of each well. The cells were kept in culture for
24 hours in standard conditions with different treatments.
After this time, the cells that had not migrated were gently
removed by washing with a cotton swab. The cells that

remained in the inserts were fixed with 100% methanol for
2 minutes and stained with cristal violet. The stained cells
were imaged using an an Axio-Scope.A1 microscope (Carl

To assess levels of protein expression cells were
lysed in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Western Blotting was carried out as previously
described [71]. The pAkt and tAkt antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling (distributed through
New England Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt am Main,
Germany). β-Actin antibody was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Incubation
of membranes after SDS-Gel electrophoresis and
transfer on nitrocellulose membranes with the primary
antibodies (1:200 to 1:1000) was performed overnight
at 4°C. After washing, the membranes were incubated
with the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots were
developed using the ECL Western Blotting analysis system
(GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) and visualized by
developing of standard X-ray films.
