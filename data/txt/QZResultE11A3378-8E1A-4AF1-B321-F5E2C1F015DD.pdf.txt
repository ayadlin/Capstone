Abstract
EGF activates NF-kB, and constitutively activated NF-kB contributes to EGFR mutation-associated tumorigenesis, but it remains unclear precisely how EGFR signaling leads to NF-kB activation. Here we report that
CARMA3, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing scaffold molecule, is required for EGF-induced NFkB activation. CARMA3 deficiency impaired the activation of the IKK complex following EGF stimulation,
resulting in a defect of EGF-induced IkBa phosphorylation and NF-kB activation. We found that CARMA3 and
Bcl10 contributed to several characteristics of EGFR-associated malignancy, including proliferation, survival,
migration, and invasion. Most importantly, CARMA3 contributed to tumor growth in vivo. Our findings elucidate
a crucial link between EGFR-proximal signaling components and the downstream IKK complex, and they
suggest a new therapeutic target for treatment of EGFR-driven cancers. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2183–92. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kB) is a family of transcription
factors that regulates immunological and inflammatory
responses, as well as cell survival (1). They are often constitutively activated in cancers (2). NF-kB controls the expression of prosurvival and antiapoptotic genes, proinflammatory
cytokines, and cyclins (3). Therefore, the constitutively activated NF-kB contributes to cancer cell survival, transformation and progression (2, 3), and upregulates the expression of
various proteins involving in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and metastasis of cancer cells (4). Thus, the
end result of the constitutively activated NF-kB in cancer cells
is their resistance to apoptotic stimuli and their increased
proliferation and migration, which are all hallmarks of cancer
(5). However, different cancers activate NF-kB through different mechanisms. Therefore, revealing various signaling
pathways that lead to activation of NF-kB will provide the
therapeutic targets for treatment of different cancers.

Multiple receptors, such as the TNFa receptor (TNFR), tolllike receptor (TLR), antigen receptor, and G-protein-coupled
receptors (GPCR), can activate this pathway leading to activation of NF-kB (1, 6, 7). Several growth factors, including
epidermal growth factor (EGF; refs. 8, 9), insulin-like growth
factor (IGF; refs. 10–12), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF;
refs. 6, 13), and fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; refs. 14–16),
can also induce weak, but notable NF-kB activation through
their receptors that belong to a family of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK). Different human cancer cell lines have been
shown to exhibit elevated levels of activated NF-kB, which are
due to the overexpression or mutations of receptors for EGF,
heregulin (HRG), or IGF. NF-kB activation is one of downstream events in EGF receptor (EGFR or erbB1/HER1) signaling (17), particularly in ER-negative breast cancer (9, 18).
Stimulation of EGFR-expressing breast cancer cell lines with
EGF induces NF-kB activation, which could be blocked by the
inhibitor of IKK, an upstream enzyme complex of the NF-kB
signal transduction cascade. Inhibition of NF-kB activation
suppresses the growth of murine breast tumors with active
NF-kB and inhibition of IKK incapacitates tumor formation
(19). Although many reports implicate that Akt and IKK are
involved in EGFR-induced NF-kB activation, the molecular
mechanism by which EGFR signaling pathway leads to NF-kB
activation remains largely unknown. Therefore, it is necessary
to elucidate how EGFR link to NF-kB pathway, which will
provide novel drug targets to inhibit cancer progression.
Caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like domain protein (CARMA) family
of proteins are scaffold proteins. It contains 3 members,
CARMA1 (also known as CARD11), CARMA2 (CARD14),
and CARMA3 (CARD10; refs. 20–23). These 3 proteins share
similar structural motifs, with an N-terminal CARD domain,
followed by a coiled-coil (CC) domain, a PDZ domain, a SH3
domain, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domain

(21–23). However, they have distinct expression patterns with
CARMA1 expressed in hematopoietic cells, CARMA2 in the
placenta and several mucosal tissues (20), and CARMA3 in all
nonhematopoietic cells (21–24). Early studies by our lab and
others have demonstrated that CARMA1 plays an essential
role in mediating antigen receptor-induced NF-kB activation
(25–27). Recent studies demonstrated that CARMA3, a scaffold protein, is required for GPCR- and PKC-induced NF-kB
activation (28, 29) and its potential role in cancer progression
(30). In addition, several studies indicate that the downstream
signaling components of CARMA3, namely B-cell lymphoma
protein 10 (BCL10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1), are also required for
GPCR and PKC-induced NF-kB activation (29, 31, 32). Because
PKC participates in NF-kB-activation induced by other receptors such as EGFR (18, 33), we hypothesized that CARMA3
might play an important role in EGFR-induced NF-kB activation. Here we show that CARMA3 is required for EGFRinduced NF-kB activation. We also found that CARMA3
deficiency affected cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. Importantly, suppressing CARMA3 expression significantly inhibited cancer cell growth in vivo.
Together, our studies reveal a key signal transduction cascade
that mediates EGFR-induced NF-kB activation, and the functional significance of this pathway in cancer cell growth.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and reagents
Phospho-specific antibodies for ERK1/2 (9101), IkBa (9246),
and IKKa/b (2681), as well as total EGFR (2232) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against
phospho-EGFR, IkBa (371, clone C21), IKKa/b (7607, clone H470), and actin (8432, clone C-2) were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. DNA-oligo probes for NF-kB (E3291),
OCT1 (E3241), and AP1 (E3201) were purchased from Promega. AG1478, AG825, Genistein, and mouse EGF was from
Sigma. TNFa was from Endogen. Lentivirus-encoded shRNA
were purchased from Sigma.
MDA468 cells were purchased from ATCC in 2008, and
aliquots of these cells (less than 5 passages from the purchasing vial) were kept in liquid nitrogen before usage. A431 cells
were tested for their authenticity in the Characterized Cell
Line Core Facility in MDA Cancer Center in August of 2009.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
To conduct the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
experiments, 1 106 to 2  106 cells were starved overnight,
stimulated for appropriate times with various agents, and
nuclear extracts were prepared. Nuclear extracts (5–10 mg)
were incubated with 1  105 cpm of 32P-labeled probes at room
temperature for 15 minutes. The samples were separated on a
native Tris-Borate-EDTA polyacrylamide gel, which was dried
at 80 C for 1 to 2 hours, and then exposed to X-ray film.
Lentivirus infection for shRNA knockdown
Lentiviruses were generated by transfecting HEK293T with
packaging vectors encoding VSV-G using the calcium preci-

pitation method. One or 2 days later, the supernatant was
collected from the cells, spun at 3000  g for 10 minutes to
pellet any cell debris, and applied directly to target cells. Cells
were placed under the selection with media containing puromycin, and resultant pools were used for experiments.
MTT assay
To conduct the MTT assay, cells were seeded in wells of a
96-well plate in 200 mL of complete or serum-free media. At
the indicated time, 20 mL of MTT was dissolved at 5 mg/mL in
sterile PBS, was added to the cells. 2 hours later, the media was
removed, the metabolized MTT was resuspended in DMSO,
and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. The experiment
was performed in triplicates.
Colony formation assay
The soft agar colony formation assays were performed as
following. First, 2.4% agarose in complete 1 DMEM (diluted
from complete 2 DMEM at pH 7.2) was melted in 37 C water
bath. Then the agarose was mixed with complete media to a
final concentration of 0.6% agarose, and layered 0.5mL on the
bottom of each well in 24-well plates. For A431 cells, 1,250 cells
were mixed with stock agarose and complete media to a final
concentration of 0.3% agarose in 0.5 mL, and 10 ng/mL of EGF
was added to this mixture. A total of 0.5 mL of this mixture was
layered on top of the solidified 0.6% lower layer. The cell
cultures were maintained in incubator for 2 weeks to allow
colony formation. Every 4 to 6 days after preparing agarose,
100 mL of half-complete media with 10 ng/mL of EGF were
added to keep the cells growth. Two weeks later, cells were
fixed with 4% paraformadehyde in PBS, and stained with
0.5 mL of 0.005% crystal violet for more than 1 hour. Put
the top layer on the microscope slides and dry till it became
membrane. Colonies of diameter more than 45mm were
counted manually using a microscope. For MDA468 cells, 1
 104 cells were mixed with 0.3% agarose, and layered down
on the top of the lower gel. The experiments were repeated 3
times.
Cell-cycle distribution
Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with
PBS. The cells were then fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol at 4 C
for 18 hours. The fixed cell suspensions were washed with PBS,
and then treated with 500 mL 50 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI),
2.5 mL 0.1 mg/mL RNase A, and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 40
minutes at 37 C in the dark. Cell-cycle profile was analyzed by
a flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACS Canto II).
Anoikis and apoptosis assay
Anoikis assay was mainly based on previously described
procedures (34). Briefly, cells were seeded in 25 mm2 low cellbinding flasks (coated with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, polyHEMA, 10 g/L in 100% ethanol) at a density of 1  106 cells per
flask in serum-free media containing EGF and incubated
vertically at 37 C, 5% CO2 for 24 hours. Cells were collected
by centrifugation, fixated, and stained with PI. The number of
total and viable cells was determined using a flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson FACS Canto II).

CARMA3-Mediated NF-kB Activation and Cancer Cell Growth

For apoptosis assay, cells were collected by trypsinization
and washed with cold-PBS, 1  105 and 1  106 cells were
resuspended in 100 mL of Annexin V incubation solution,
which includes 10 mL 10 binding buffer, 10 mL PI, 1 mL
Annexin V-FITC and water. These cells were incubated in the
dark for 15 minutes at room temperature and analyzed within
1 hour, and the percent of apoptotic (Annexin V-positive) cells
was determined by the ﬂow cytometry.
Cell migration and invasion assay
Cell migration ability was analyzed in modified BD Falcon
Cell Culture Insert System (35). The lower chambers (24-well
plates) were placed with 500 mL serum-free migration buffer
containing EGF, and cells were added to the insert, the upper
migration chamber. Plates were incubated for 16 to 18 hours
at 37 C in a 5% CO2 supplemented atmosphere. Following
incubation, cells that did not migrate were removed from the
top of the insert with sterile cotton swabs. Cells that migrated
to the lower side of the filter disk were then fixed, stained, and
quantified. All experiments were performed in triplicates.
Cellular invasion ability was assayed to determine the ability
of cells to invade a synthetic basement membrane (Matrigel;
BD Biosciences), based on a procedure described previously
(36). Polycarbonate membranes (8-mm pore size) of the insert
of BD Falcon Cell Culture Insert System were coated with
Matrigel at 50 mL/cm2 of growth surface. Cell suspension (1.25
 104) was added to the insert, and the lower chamber was
filled with 500 mL serum-free medium with EGF. Then, the
tumor invasion system was incubated at 37 C for and allowed
to invade through the Matrigel barrier for 24 hours. Following
incubation, membranes were fixed with 4% paraformadehyde
in PBS and stained (Giemsa; Sigma-Aldrich). Noninvading
cells were removed using a clean cotton swab, whereas
invading cells on the underside of the membrane were
counted using an inverted microscope. All experiments were
performed in triplicates.
Mouse xenograft tumor model
Six to 8 weeks age of BALB/c nude (Nu/Nu) mice were
purchased from Harlan laboratories Inc. A431 cells (1  106) or
MDA468 cells (3  106) were suspended in a total volume of
100 mL of a 1:1 mixture of appropriate medium versus Matrigel
(BD Biosciences). The cell suspension was injected subcutaneously in male of nude mice, or at the fat pad of female of
nude mice, respectively. One week after inoculating, tumors
volumes were measured twice a week and calculated by the
formula p/6 [length (mm)  width (mm)]2. All the animal
procedures were conducted under the institution's guidelines.

Results
CARMA3 contributes to cancer cell growth
Previous studies demonstrate that the CARMA3-Bcl10MALT1 (CBM) complex plays an essential role for GPCRinduced NF-kB activation (28, 29, 31, 32), and CARMA3 is also
implicated downstream of Ras signaling pathway in cancer
cells (30). To determine whether CARMA3 has a role in cancer
cell growth, we obtained 2 lentiviral constructs encoding

www.aacrjournals.org

CARMA3 shRNA (sh47 and sh48), which could significantly
suppress CARMA3 mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. 1).
We first infected MDA468 cells with the lentivirus encoded
CARMA3 shRNAs or green fluorescent protein (GFP) shRNA
and then examined the growth rate of these cells using MTT
assay. With CARMA3 shRNA knockdown, MDA468 cells displayed reduced MTT-converting activity comparing to the
negative and GFP shRNA control (Fig. 1A). Similar to MDA468
cells, we found that knockdown of CARMA3 also reduced the
growth rate of A431 cells (Fig. 1B) and several cancer cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. 2A). To further confirm the role of the
CBM complex in cell growth, we also examined the growth
rate of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) from wild-type and
CARMA3- or Bcl10-deficient (KO) mice using the MTT assay.
We found that both of CARMA3 KO and Bcl10 KO MEF cells
grew significantly slower than wild-type cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2B). Together, these data indicate that the CARMA3Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) complex plays an important role for
cancer cell growth.
To further determine the effect of CARMA3 on cell proliferation, we analyzed the cell-cycle profile of MDA468 breast
cancer cells with or without CARMA3 knockdown, and found
that the percentage of G0/G1 phase was increased in cells with
CARMA3 knockdown, whereas the percentage of G2/M phase
was decreased in these cells compared with nontransduced
(WT) or GFP shRNA (Mock) control cells (Fig. 1C), indicating
that suppression of CARMA3 expression induces a G0/G1
arrest. We also checked the expression of cyclin D1 by
quantitative PCR, and found that the expression of cyclin
D1 mRNA was significantly lower in MDA468 cells with
CARMA3 knockdown than wild type and mock control
(Fig. 1D). Together, these results suggest that inhibiting
CARMA3 expression suppresses cell growth.
CARMA3 is required for EGF-induced NF-kB activation
Among previously investigated cancer cell lines, MDA231,
MDA468, MDA453, A431, H1975, and PC3 cells have higher
expression levels of EGFR, and also displayed a more significant reduction of growth rate with CARMA3 knockdown
(Supplementary Fig. 2A). Therefore, we hypothesized that
the CBM complex may involve in EGF-induced signal transduction. As it has been shown that EGF can induce NF-kB
activation (9), we decided to determine whether CARMA3 is
required for EGF-induced NF-kB activation in cancer cells. To
address this question, we prepared MEF cells from wild-type
(Carma3þ/þ) and CARMA3-deficinent (Carma3/) mice and
stimulated them with EGF. We found that EGF could effectively induce NF-kB activation in a dose-dependent manner in
wild-type cells, but this activation was completely abolished in
CARMA3-deficient cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, TNFa could
effectively activate NF-kB in both wild-type and CARMA3deficient cells (Fig. 2A). As EGF induces both EGFR homodimer and EGFR/HER2 heterodimer formation, we sought to
determine which receptor was responsible for EGF-induced
NF-kB activation. To do this, we pretreated MEF cells with the
nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, the EGFRspecific inhibitor AG1478, the HER2-specific inhibitor
AG825, or the latter 2 drugs together. We observed that

Figure 1. CARMA3 deficiency affects cell cycle and cancer cell growth. A, MDA-468 cells with stably expressing CARMA3 shRNA (sh47 and sh48) or
negative control (GFP) were seeded in 96-well plates. Cell proliferation was examined at 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively, by the MTT assay. The absorbance
at 570 nm at different time points was determined. The experiment was repeated 3 times, and the result from one of these experiments is presented. B, MTT
assay was similarly performed to examine the growth rate of A431 cells with CARMA3 shRNA (sh47) or mock control. C, aforementioned MDA cells were
grown in DMEM complete media overnight. The cells were harvested, fixed, and subjected to PI staining for cell-cycle analysis by FACS. Data from different
cell-cycle phase was presented as percentage of cells (**, P < 0.01; *, P > 0.05). D, real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression level of cyclin D1
using total RNA that were prepared from MDA468 cells (WT), or MDA468 cells that transduced with control shRNA for GFP (Mock) or CARMA3 shRNA
(sh47 and sh48). The expression level of GAPDH was used as internal controls.

genistein completely abolished EGF-induced nuclear localization NF-kB (Supplementary Fig. 3). For either AG1478 or
AG825 alone, they could only partially reduce nuclear localization of NF-kB. However, combination of the 2 drugs led to
an almost complete inhibition of EGF-induced nuclear localization of NF-kB (Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating that both
EGFR and HER2 are required for EGF-induced NF-kB activation. Together, our data indicate that CARMA3 is selectively
involved in EGF-, but not TNFa-induced NF-kB activation.
To further verify that the observed defect in Carma3/
cells was due to CARMA3 deficiency, CARMA3-deficient cells
that were reconstituted with and without CARMA3 (C3KOWT and C3KO-Vec) were stimulated with EGF. Consistent
with above results, we found that expression of CARMA3 in
CARMA3-deficient cells restored the EGF-induced NF-kB
activation (Fig. 2B). CARMA3 deficiency resulted in a defect
of EGF-induced IkBa phosphorylation (Fig. 2C), indicating
that CARMA3 is required for EGF-induced IKK activation.
Similar to our previous finding that CARMA3 is not required
for GPCR-induced IKK phosphorylation (28), we also interestingly found that EGF-induced IKK phosphorylation was not
defective in CARMA3-deficient cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast to

2186

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

the defect of IKK and NF-kB activation, EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK was intact in these cells
(Fig. 2C). Together, these results indicate that CARMA3 plays
a specific role in EGFR signaling pathway leading to NF-kB
activation.
As Bcl10 binds to CARMA3 and is required for GPCRinduced NF-kB activation (29, 31, 32), and forms a complex
with CARMA3, we decided to determine whether Bcl10 is also
involved in EGF-induced NF-kB activation. To address this
question, MEF cells prepared from Bcl10-heterozygous
(Bcl10þ/) or Bcl10-deficient (Bcl10/) mouse embryos were
stimulated with increasing doses of EGF. We found that the
Bcl10-deficient cells were also defective in EGF-induced, but
not TNFa-induced NF-kB activation (Fig. 2D). This result
suggests that the CBM complex is required for EGF-induced
NF-kB activation.
To further demonstrate the role of the CBM complex in
EGF-induced NF-kB activation in cancer cells, A431 cells and
MDA468 cells that were transduced with CARMA3 shRNA
(shC3-47 and shC3-48)) and Bcl10 shRNA (shBcl10), were
stimulated with EGF. We found that knockdown of CARMA3,
which decreased CARMA3 expression in A431 and MDA468

Figure 4. CARMA3 deficiency affects the characteristics of cancer cells. A, A431 cells transduced with shRNA for control (shLuc), CARMA3 (shC3),
or Bcl10 (shBcl10) were subjected to colony formation assay in the presence of 10 ng/mL of EGF for 2 weeks. Two fields per plate were photographed and
presented (top). The bar graph indicates the mean and differences among the groups in colony number, and the SD was calculated from the average of colony
numbers in 3 different plates (bottom). B, aforementioned cells were seeded in the upper chamber of Transwell Boyden chamber, and then 10 ng/mL

average of cells in the 5 fields (bottom). C, aforementioned in cells were seeded in the upper chamber of Transwell Boyden chamber with matrix-gel and then 10

and Bcl10 play a specific role in EGFR signaling pathway
leading to NF-kB activation.
Knockdown of CARMA3 inhibits the characteristics of
cancer cells
To determine whether CARMA3 plays an important role in
tumorigenesis, we compared the colony formation ability of
A431 cells transduced with control shRNA (shLuc), CARMA3
shRNA (shC3), or Bcl10 shRNA (shBcl10) in soft agar cultures.
Cells with control shRNA (shLuc) grew well in soft agar with
well developed colonies, whereas the colony number of
CARMA3 shRNA- or Bcl10 shRNA-transduced cells was significantly reduced (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the colony formation
ability of MDA468 cells with CARMA3 knockdown was also
significantly impaired (Supplementary Fig. 5).
To further examine the contribution of CARMA3 and Bcl10
to cancer cell malignancy, we examined whether CARMA3 and
Bcl10 contributes to migratory and invasive phenotypes of
cancer cells, which are characteristics of malignant tumors.
Using the Boyden-chamber assay, we found that the migration
ability of CARMA3- and Bcl10-knockdown A431 cancer cells
was significantly lower than the shLuc control cells (Fig. 4B).
Furthermore, we examined invasion ability of these cells in the
Matrigel-coated Transwell system, and found that the invasive

2188

ability of CARMA3-knockdown cells was also reduced compared with the mock control cells (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the
knockdown of CARMA3 in MDA468 cells also reduced the
migration and invasion ability of these cells (Supplementary
Fig. 6). Together, these results demonstrate that CARMA3
plays an important role in controlling cancer cell migration
and invasion.
CARMA3-mediated signaling plays a critical role for
cancer cell survival
Another common feature of carcinoma development and
growth is the ability of transformed cells to survive under the
anchorage-independent "anoikis" condition. To determine
whether CARMA3 contributes to the resistance of anoikis,
we cultured MDA468 cancer cell in 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-coated flasks that provide cancer cells an anchorageindependent environment. We found that CARMA3 knockdown MDA468 cells were very sensitive to anoikis and resulted
in 97.1% (shC3-47) and 97.5% (shC3-48) of apoptotic cells,
respectively, after 24 hours cultured in the anchorage-independent condition (Fig. 5A). In contrast, nontransduced and
mock control cells were relatively resistant to anoikis with
60.9% and 50% of apoptotic cells in this culture condition
(Fig. 5A). As NF-kB activation plays a critical role for cell

Figure 5. CARMA3 is required for resistance to 5-FU-induced cell death.
MDA468 cells, without transducing shRNA (None) or with transducing
GFP shRNA (mock) or CARMA3 shRNA (sh47 and sh48), were seeded at
equal density, grown to subconfluence, starved, and incubated with EGF
(100 mmol/L) for overnight. These cells were then trypsinized, and then
cultured in single cell suspensions in 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-coated
flasks for 24 hours. Cells were harvested, fixed, stained with Annexin V
staining, and subjected to FACS analysis (top). The percentage of Annexin
V-positive cells was plotted into the bar graph (bottom). B, aforementioned
cells were starved in serum-free media and stimulated with 20 mg/mL of
5-FU and 100 ng/mL of EGF for 48 hours, and then stained with
PE-conjugated PI and FITC-labeled Annexin V. The resulted cells were
subjected to FACS for apoptosis analysis. The early apoptosis cells
(Annexin V-positive Q4 cells) were plotted into the bar graph. These
experiments were repeated for 3 times, and similar results were obtained.

survival, we next determine whether CARMA3-mediated signaling contributes to the survival of cancer cells by examining
the apoptosis rate of MDA468 cells in the condition with the
treatment of chemotherapy drug, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We
found that the apoptosis rate of MDA468 cells with CARMA3
knockdown was significantly increased in the presence of 5FU (Fig. 5B). Therefore, these results indicate that CARMA3
may contribute to cancer cell survival.
Suppression of CARMA3 expression reduces tumor
growth in vivo
To further investigate the role of CARMA3 in tumor growth
and progression in vivo, we inoculated A431 cells, with or
without CARMA3 shRNA knockdown (shC3 or mock), subcutaneously in nude mice to induce xenograft tumors. After
tumors established a week after inoculation, tumor size was
measured twice a week and calculated by the formula:
p/6[length (mm)]  [width (mm)]2. In this xenograft model,
A431 cells with CARMA3 shRNA knockdown showed a significant reduction of tumors growth than that of mock control
(Fig. 6A). The average tumor weight of mock and CARMA3knockdown A431 cells was 0.44 g  0.11 and 0.17 g  0.12 (P <
0.001), respectively, at the day 18 after inoculation (Fig. 6B, and
Supplementary Fig. 7). In a similar set of experiment, we also
inoculated MDA468 cells with or without CARMA3 knock-

down (shC3 or mock) on each side of fat pads of nude mice to
induce xenograft tumors. We found that MDA468 cells with
CARMA3 knockdown also showed a similar reduction of
tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. 8), although the size
difference between mock (0.30 g  0.14) and CARMA3-knockdown (0.19 g  0.09) in MDA468 cell-induced tumors at the
end of 30 days after inoculation of these cells (Supplementary
Fig. 8) was less than those in A431 cell-induced tumors
(Fig. 6B). Together, the similar effect of CARMA3 depletion
on the in vivo tumor growth of both A431 and MDA468 cancer
cell lines indicates that CARMA3 plays a critical role in tumor
growth and progression.

Many literatures have reported that EGFR family members
can induce NF-kB activation and suggest a role of NF-kB in
EGFR-induced tumorigenesis. However, the molecular
mechanism by which EGFR signaling cascade links to the
NF-kB activation remains elusive and controversial. In this
study, we provide the genetic evidence showing that CARMA3
and Bcl10, which are essential components for G proteincoupled receptor (GPCR)-induced NF-kB, are also required for
EGF-induced NF-kB activation. Similar to the role of GPCR
signaling pathway, we have found that CARMA3 deficiency
causes a loss in EGF-induced IkBa phosphorylation and NFkB activation. Furthermore, we have shown that CARMA3
contributes to cancer cell proliferation and survival and
regulates various characteristics of cancer cells, including
colony-forming ability, survival, migration, and invasion.
Finally, we show that suppressing CARMA3 expression significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. Based on our current
findings, we propose that CARMA3 is functioned downstream
of PKC, and forms a complex with Bcl10, which leads to the
K63-linked ubiquitination of the IKK complex as proposed for
GPCR signaling pathway (28). At the same time, another
kinase, MEKK3 (37), functions downstream of PKC and phosphorylates the IKK complex. The phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the IKK complex is required for EGFR-induced
NF-kB activation (Fig. 7). Together, our studies reveal a
genetic link between EGFR-proximal signaling components
to the downstream NF-kB activation complex, and demonstrate that CARMA3-associated signaling plays a critical role
in cancer progression.
The impact of CARMA3-mediated NF-kB activation on
tumor growth in vivo is likely due to several NF-kB-associated
mechanisms. First, the cell-cycle progression in CARMA3knockdown cells is slower and cell metabolism rate is
decreased. Second, cell apoptosis rate is increased in CARMA3
knockdown cells. These functional outcomes of CARMA3
deficiency likely contribute to tumor growth in vivo directly.
The impact of CARMA3-mediated NF-kB activation on tumor
growth can also be due to an indirect mechanism. In this case,
our preliminary studies have found that suppression of
CARMA3 expression blocks EGF-induced expression of several
cytokines such as IL-6 (Jiang and Lin, unpublished results), as
IL-6 can activate Stat3 that has been shown to contribute to
EGFR-associated cancer cell growth (38, 39). Therefore,

CARMA3-mediated cytokine production may also contribute
to cancer cell growth in vivo. In addition to cancer cell growth,
our studies also indicate that CARMA3 deficiency affects
cancer cell migration and invasion. This effect is likely due
to that CARMA3 deficiency may affect the expression of some
genes that are involved in cell migration and invasion. Therefore, it will be interesting to address whether CARMA3 deficiency affect cancer cell metastasis in the future studies.
Our results also indicate the functional similarity among the
CARMA family members. Previous studies have been determined that CARMA1, the hematopoietic homologue of
CARMA3, functions downstream of the T-cell receptor
(TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) to activate NF-kB. Although
TCR and BCR do not contain kinase activity, they recruit
several tyrosine kinases, Lck, ZAP70, and Syk. Like EGFR

signaling pathways, tyrosine kinases in TCR and BCR signaling
pathways lead to activation of PKC family members that
activate NF-kB through phosphorylating CARMA1. Similar
to these signaling pathways, PKC inhibitors also completely
abolish EGFR-induced NF-kB activation (data not shown).
Therefore, we predict that a specific isoform(s) of PKC may
phosphorylate CARMA3 in the EGFR signaling pathway, leading to activation of NF-kB. Identification of such a PKC
isoform and determination of phosphorylation sites in
CARMA3 may provide the detailed mechanism by which
EGF signaling leads to activation of the CARMA3-associated
signaling cascade.
In TCR signaling pathway, it has been shown that CARMA1
is recruited into the TCR complex by a hematopoietic tissuespecific adaptor protein, ADAP (40). To determine whether

CARMA3-Mediated NF-kB Activation and Cancer Cell Growth

CARMA3 is directly or indirectly recruited into the EGFR
complex, we have immunoprecipitated EGFR complex from
A431 cells following EGF stimulation. However, we were
unable to detect CARMA3 in this immunoprecipitated complex (data not shown), suggesting that CARMA3 may be also
recruited to EGFR complex through an adaptor molecule(s) in
epithelial cells. Therefore, it will require a more systemic
approach to identify the molecule that links CARMA3 to
the EGFR complex in the future studies.
It has been shown that CARMA1 plays a critical role for a
subset of diffused large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and suppression the expression is highly sensitive for the survival of
these lymphoma cells (41). In addition, mutations of CARMA1
have been found in a significant part of DLBCL patients (42,
43). It is possible that similar mutations in CARMA3 or
overexpression of CARMA3 may result in a constitutively
activated NF-kB, and contribute to tumor progression of
cancer in epithelial cells. Therefore, it will be interesting to
examine whether there are any mutation(s) or overexpression
of CARMA3 in nonhematopoietic malignant cells in the future
studies.
Mutation or aberrant expression of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK) has been appreciated as a causative mechanism
of tumorigenesis in multiple types of cancer including breast,
lung, and brain cancers for a long time. Despite this, inhibitors
of these receptors have yet to reach their full clinical potential.
Furthermore, targeting common downstream signaling pathways of RTKs will be an alternative therapeutic approach for
different types of cancers. Therefore, identification of common signaling pathways downstream of these receptors would
provide the molecular insight for designing the therapeutic
agents for various cancers. It has been shown that multiple
RTKs, such as PDGFR, FGFR, and IGFR, can induce NF-kB
activation. Because these RTKs share similar downstream
signaling cascades with EGFR, we predict that these RTKs
may also utilize the CBM complex to activate NF-kB. However,

due to technical difficulty, we have not been able to show that
these receptors can activate NF-kB in the wild-type MEF cells
(data not shown). Therefore, the activation of NF-kB by these
receptors may be a tissue-specific event. To determine
whether these RTKs also utilize the CARMA3-mediated pathway to activate NF-kB, identification and use a specific cell
type is needed.
In addition, various hematological malignancies depend
upon RTK signaling. For example, some of multiple myeloma
depends on FGFR3, and acute myeloid Leukemia (AML)
depends heavily on FLT3. Both FGFR3 and FLT3 have been
implicated to activate NF-kB. Therefore, it will be important
to determine whether NF-kB activation contributes to
tumorigenesis of multiple myeloma and AML. Because
CARMA1, and not CARMA3, is expressed in cells from the
myeloid lineage, it is possible that CARMA1 may play a role
in mediating NF-kB activation downstream of RTKs in
hematopoietic cells. Therefore, it will be important to determine whether CARMA1 plays an essential role in RTK
signaling pathway in hematopietic cells. Such studies will
likely provide novel therapeutic targets for treatment of
various cancers.
