Abstract

Author Manuscript

Observations that genome-wide DNA hypomethylation induces genomic instability and tumors in
animals caution against the indiscriminate use of demethylating agents, such as 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC). Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts harboring a lacZ
mutational reporter construct that allows the quantification and characterization of a wide range of
mutational events, we found that in addition to demethylation, treatment with 5-Aza-dC induces γH2AX expression, a marker for DNA breaks, and both point mutations and genome
rearrangements. To gain insight into the source of these mutations we first tested the hypothesis
that the mutagenic effect of 5-Aza-dC may be directly mediated through the DNA
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) covalently trapped in 5-Aza-dC-substituted DNA. Knock-down of
DNMT1 resulted in increased resistance to the cytostatic effects of 5-Aza-dC, delayed onset of γH2AX expression and a significant reduction in the frequency of genome rearrangements. There
was no effect on the 5-Aza-dC-induced point mutations. An alternative mechanism for 5-Aza-dCinduced demethylation and genome rearrangements via activation-induced cytidine deaminase
(AID) followed by base excision repair (BER) was found not to be involved. That is, 5-Aza-dC
treatment did not significantly induce AID expression and inhibition of BER did not reduce the
frequency of genome rearrangements. Thus, our results indicate that the formation of DNMT1
adducts is the prevalent mechanism of 5-Aza-dC-induced genome rearrangements, although
hypomethylation per se may still contribute. Since the therapeutic effects of 5-Aza-dC greatly
depend on the presence of DNMT1, the expression level of DNA methyltransferases in tumors
may serve as a prognostic factor for the efficacy of 5-Aza-dC treatment.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Hypermethylation of cytosines has been identified as a critical factor in transcriptional
repression of tumor suppressor genes (1). Therefore, inhibition of DNA methylation could
be an effective cancer treatment. 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) has significant
demethylating activity and is currently approved by the FDA to treat myelodysplastic
syndromes. 5-Aza-dC is incorporated into nucleic acids of proliferating cells as a cytidine
analog and prevents methylation at CpG sites of newly synthesized DNA by irreversible
covalent binding to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the major methylation
maintenance enzyme, eventually depleting the cellular pool of this enzyme (2). This makes
the maintenance of the genomic DNA methylation status less efficient and leads to global
hypomethylation. Thus, the therapeutic effect of 5-Aza-dC could be due to re-expression of
growth suppressor genes in the tumor cells or toxicity of the covalently bound DNMT1 to 5Aza-dC-substituted DNA.
The most important long-term effects of 5-Aza-dC are mutations, which can arise during
processing of 5-Aza-dC induced DNA lesions. Interestingly, the hypomethylation itself,
caused by 5-Aza-dC, has been speculated to cause genetic instability in form of gains or
losses of whole chromosomes (3). Moreover, studies with mouse embryonic stem cells
deficient for DNMT1, leading to pronounced hypomethylation, demonstrated increased level
of genome rearrangements, the latter measured by the frequency of inactivation of the
endogenous reporter gene HPRT and an integrated thymidine kinase transgene (4).

Author Manuscript

While studies on the mutagenicity of 5-Aza-dC have been performed using different models
and different mutation detection methods (5-10), the utilized approaches were not able to
comprehensively detect both point mutations and genome rearrangements. Here we
investigated the mutagenic effects of 5-Aza-dC using embryonic fibroblasts from a mouse
model harboring a lacZ-plasmid reporter construct that allows the detection of a broad range
of mutations and discriminate between point mutations and genome rearrangements (11).
We confirm that 5-Aza-dC is highly mutagenic and capable of inducing point mutations as
previously shown. However, we also show that the drug causes a substantial number of
genome rearrangements in primary mouse fibroblasts. We subsequently show that although
5-Aza-dC is a potent demethylating agent, it is the DNMT1 DNA adducts but not the
hypomethylation per se that cause genome rearrangements possibly via induction of DNA
double-strand breaks.

Mutagenesis, DNA methylation and growth in 5-Aza-dC-treated MEFs
Although there are numerous reports on the mutagenicity of 5-Aza-dC, the exact mechanism
of the mutagenic effects and the spectrum of induced mutations still remain unclear. To
examine 5-Aza-dC-induced mutation frequency and spectra in mammalian cells, we used
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from a transgenic mouse harboring a chromosomally
integrated lacZ reporter gene construct that can be recovered in E. coli. Mutation frequencies
are determined on a per locus basis, i.e., as the ratio of inactivated lacZ genes over the total

number of lacZ copies recovered from a given DNA sample. Downstream analysis of the
mutant lacZ genes allowed us to determine the class of mutation, i.e., point mutation or
genomic rearrangement, that led to the inactivation of the lacZ gene (11, 12).

Author Manuscript

We first tested if 1 μM 5-Aza-dC, the concentration previously reported to have a virtually
maximal cytotoxic effect on mouse ES cells (13), was still effective when used with our
model system. We found that the proliferation of transgenic lacZ MEFs cultured in the
presence of 1 μM 5-Aza-dC was significantly suppressed (Figure 1a). However, cells were
still able to divide, thereby incorporating the cytidine analog. This was indicated by a
significant decrease in DNA methylation level of the lacZ reporter gene, which is normally
heavily methylated, after 3 days of growth in the presence of 5-Aza-dC (Figure 1b). Under
these conditions 5-Aza-dC has a significant mutagenic effect, as indicated by an almost 10fold increase of the lacZ mutation frequency (Figure 1c). The majority of the mutations were
genome rearrangements (66%), slightly higher than the rearrangement fraction of the
spontaneous mutations in the untreated control cells (59%). While these results confirm that
5-Aza-dC induces point mutations, they also indicate that genome rearrangements are the
major component of the mutation spectrum. Analysis of 5-Aza-dC-induced point mutations
revealed that almost 42% of them were C->G transversions, whereas in control samples no
apparent bias towards any particular type of substitution was detected (Figure 1d).
Rearrangements in this system are lacZ mutants with one breakpoint in the lacZ gene and
the other breakpoint outside the reporter on the same chromosome (deletions or inversions)
or another chromosome (translocations). Only illegitimate recombinations can be detected
with this system and extensive homology at the breakpoints has never been reported (14).

Author Manuscript

To rule out the possibility that a large fraction of the observed mutations had originated in E.
coli during the rescue process we tested the mutagenic effect of a short, one hour incubation
with 5-Aca-dC. While this would give rise to partially 5-Aza-dC-substituted DNA, in
mammalian cells the time period would be too short to fix the damage into mutations. As
shown in Figure 1e, longer incubation times are required for elevated mutation frequencies
to appear. This indicates that 5-Aza-substituted DNA does not by itself gives rise to
mutations in E. coli but requires processing in mammalian cells.
Down-regulation of DNMT1 attenuates the ability of 5-Aza-dC to induce genomic
rearrangements

Author Manuscript

DNMT1 can covalently bind to 5-Aza-dC at the hemi-methylated CpG sites. To directly test
for a possible effect of DNMT1 on 5-Aza-dC-induced DNA mutations we analyzed lacZ
mutagenicity of 5-Aza-dC in MEFs with normal DNMT1 expression level and in cells with
down-regulated DNMT1 by specific siRNA (DNMT1-KD MEFs). A comparison of the
DNMT1 mRNA levels in control MEFs and DNMT1-KD MEFs revealed a sharp (>90%)
decrease in the amount of DNMT1 transcripts 24 hours after transfection with targeting
siRNA. The mRNA levels of DNMT1 remained significantly (>75%) down-regulated for at
least 72 hours after the transfection (data not shown).
The administration of 5-Aza-dC began 72 hours after lacZ MEFs were transfected with
either DNMT1 or scrambled, i.e. non-targeting, siRNA. To ensure that cells were actively
dividing at the moment of the 5-Aza-dC treatment and were able to incorporate the drug,

cells were re-plated 48 hours after transfection, i.e. 24 hours before the first administration
of 5-Aza-dC. The lacZ MEFs were cultured in medium supplemented with 5-Aza-dC for 72
hours, with fresh medium containing the drug added every 24 hours. Cells were then
collected and mutation frequencies measured.

Author Manuscript

Similar to the results shown in Figure 1c, treatment with 5-Aza-dC (1 μM) led to an about
10-fold increase in the mutation frequency in MEFs transfected with scrambled siRNA
(Figure 2a). Here we tested several concentrations of 5-Aza-dC, but even at the lowest
concentration of 0.1 μM, a 6-fold increase in the mutation frequency as compared to the
non-treated MEFs was observed. Overall, the mutation frequency correlated with the amount
of 5-Aza-dC applied. However, the pattern of correlation was non-linear, with a tendency of
the mutation frequency to plateau at the higher doses of the drug. That is, the administration
of 1 μM 5-Aza-dC, or 10% of the maximal concentration tested, was able to produce ~70%
of maximal mutation frequency.
The administration of 5-Aza-dC to DNMT1-KD MEFs also caused a dose-dependent
increase in mutation frequency. However, the mutagenic effects of 5-Aza-dC were
significantly attenuated in DNMT1-KD MEFs as compared to scrambled siRNA treated
MEFs, at lower doses (0.1 and 1 μM) but not as much at higher dose (10 μM) (Figure 2a).
This may suggest that there are two components in the mechanism of the 5- Aza-dC
mutagenicity – DNMT1-dependent and DNMT1-independent, where the latter become
prevalent upon administration of higher doses of the drug. Of note, the DNMT1 knock-down
per se did not have any noticeable effect on the level of spontaneous mutations in the nontreated MEFs.

Author Manuscript

Depletion of DNMT1 also led to changes in the mutation spectra following the 5- Aza-dC
treatment (Figure 2b). Specifically, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of
genomic rearrangements in DNMT1-KD MEFs (27×10−5 or 38% of all mutations) as
compared to MEFs treated with scrambled siRNA (70×10−5 or 66% of all mutations), while
the frequency of point mutations remained the same between DNMT1-KD and control
MEFS, 43×10−5 and 36×10−5 respectively. The spectra of spontaneous mutations was not
affected by DNMT1 knock-down and remained similar to that observed in cells transfected
with scrambled siRNA.

Author Manuscript

To find out if there was a correlation between 5-Aza-dC induced hypomethylation and
mutagenicity we explored the effect of 5-Aza-dC administration on methylation status of
control and DNMT1-KD MEFs. The observed levels of demethylation upon treatment with
1 μM 5-Aza-dC were similar in control and DNMT1-KD MEFs (Figures 2c and 2d). Of
note, the transient down-regulation of the DNMT1 expression also did not cause any
detectable decline in the methylation level of the lacZ gene in the absence of 5-Aza-dC
(Figures 2c and 2d). The absence of a demethylating effect at the high (10 μM)dose of 5Aza-dC is most likely due to the toxicity, which fully inhibits growth and therefore
incorporation of the cytidine analog into DNA.
DNMT1-KD MEFs were significantly more resistant to the cytotoxic/cytostatic effects of 5Aza-dC at all tested doses than MEFs with normal levels of DNMT1 expression (Figure 3a).

This protective effect was not due to DNMT1 affecting cell proliferation rate since the rate
of BrdU uptake was similar in control MEFs and in DNMT1-KD MEFs (Figure 3b).
5-Aza-dC associated DNA damage response is reduced in the cells with down-regulated
DNMT1 expression

Author Manuscript

The significant effect of DNMT1 down-regulation on the induction of genome
rearrangements but not point mutations by 5-Aza-dC led us to test whether 5-Aza-dC
induces DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), an essential step in the formation of genome
rearrangements. MEFs were treated with 1 μM of 5-Aza-dC for 6, 12, 24 and 72 hours and
stained for the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (γ-H2AX), a marker of DNA breaks,
both double- and single-strand (15, 16). The flow-cytometric analysis revealed that 5-AzadC treatment increases the fraction of the γ-H2AX positive cells in a time-depedent manner
(Figure 3c). The down-regulation of DNMT1 by siRNA delayed the onset of and attenuated
the DNA damaging effect of 5-Aza-dC up to 24 hours. However, the protective effect of
DNMT1 down-regulation completely vanished when 5-Aza-dC was applied for 72 hours,
most likely because γ-H2AX expression reflects the current levels of DNA damage and the
transiently down-regulated expression of DNMT1 is recovered by 72 hours, which is
equivalent to 6 days after siRNA transfection.
5-Aza-dC-induced mutagenesis is not mediated by AID-BER pathway

Author Manuscript

A possible alternative mechanism of both 5-Aza-dC mutagenicity and 5-Aza-dC associated
hypomethylation is through activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID), previously
considered to be a B cell-specific factor (17). AID deaminates 5-methylcytosines or
cytosines, generating T-G mismatches or U-G pairs in DNA, respectively (18). These are
substrates for DNA glycosylases which initiate base excision repair (BER) pathway,
analogous to their functions in Class Switch Repair (19). Recently, genotoxic stress has been
shown to induce AID expression, which is actively involved in generation of DSBs at the
tumor translocation sites, and knock-down of AID resulted in inhibition of DSBs generation
and subsequent tumor translocation (20). We first tested whether the genotoxic stress
induced by 5-Aza-dC treatment leads to upregulated expression of AID.

Author Manuscript

Analysis of the AID expression level in the MEFs treated with 5-Aza-dC (1 μM, 72 hours)
did not reveal any significant changes in comparison with non-treated control (Figure 4a).
Conversely, when tested if down-regulation of the AID expression by siRNA (more than
70% of suppression by 72 hours after transfection) would affect the 5-Aza-dC-induced
mutagenesis, no difference was detected (Figure 4b). We then directly tested for the possible
involvement of BER in 5-Aza-dC-induced genome rearrangements by comparing the
mutation frequency and spectrum in the absence and presence of the PARP inhibitor,
olaparib. PARP inhibition has been shown to inhibit BER (21). Cells were treated with
either olaparib (500 nM), 5-Aza-dC (1 μM), or both for 3 consecutive days. We found that
olaparib alone has a modest mutagenic effect on the MEFs (Figure 4c). However, there was
no significant effect of combined 5-Aza-dC and olaparib treatment on mutation frequency or
spectra. We also found that olaparib alone led to a statistically significant suppression of the
cell growth (Figure 4d). The effect of combined application of 5-Aza-dC and olaparib on
cell growth/survival was more profound than effect of either drug administered alone.

However, the combined treatment did not reveal any synergy between olaparib and 5-AzadC – the joint effect was rather an arithmetical sum of their cytostatic/cytotoxic traits. Taken
together, these results indicate that AID-initiated BER does not affect 5-Aza-dC-induced
mutations and does not reduce the level of genome rearrangements.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

While the induction of point mutations by 5-Aza-dC has been described previously, our
present data show for the first time that the drug also induces a large number of genome
rearrangements, a much more toxic type of mutation. Interestingly, while in the past it has
been speculated that genome rearrangements could be a consequence of DNA
hypomethylation, which is also a consequence of 5-Aza-dC treatment, our present results
highlight the role of DNA double-strand breaks induced by DNMT1 covalently bound to
this nucleoside analog. Indeed, DNMT1 knock-down significantly reduces the number of
genome rearrangements, the level of γ-H2AX expression and the toxicity after treatment of
MEFs with 5-Aza-dC. Point mutations, however, were not affected.

Author Manuscript

The mechanism of 5-Aza-dC mutagenicity is complex and includes several steps (Figure 5).
First, due to the inherent instability of this compound in neutral aqueous solutions (22), 5Aza-dC incorporated into DNA is also prone to spontaneous decay or can be metabolized by
cytidine deaminases (23). Next, the resulting open ring species or 5-azauracil bases are
subject to elimination by glycosylase through an activated base excision repair mechanism
(BER). BER transiently generates abasic sites which can initiate formation of DSBs (24) and
may lead to an observed accumulation of DSBs. The emerging DSBs can be converted into
genome rearrangements. The point mutations could be created by the erroneous insertion of
dAMP across from 5-Aza-dC-mediated abasic sites (25) or due to the ability of open ring
remnants of 5-Aza-dC to pair with cytosine (7). Our data confirm the observation by
Jackson-Grusby et al (7) that C->Gtransversion is a signature point-mutation induced by 5Aza-dC, suggesting that the latter mechanism of generation of point mutation is the
prevalent one.

Author Manuscript

Concurrently, when 5-Aza-dC is incorporated into a methylated CpG site, the nucleoside
analogue may bind irreversibly to DNMT1, the enzyme responsible for maintenance of the
methylation status, forming bulky adducts which prevent the progression of replication forks
(26) and induce the ATM/ATR signaling pathway (27). The repair of such DNA-protein
cross-links involves generation of double-strand breaks (27, 28) and consequently increases
the risk of genome rearrangements. The latter scenario entirely depends on the presence of
DNMT1 and we demonstrated a significant decline in the frequency of genome
rearrangements upon treatment with 5-Aza-dC, as well as a corresponding delay in the onset
of 5-Aza-dC induced DSBs in cells with down-regulated DNMT1 expression. Of note, we
did not find a reduction in the number of 5-Aza-induced point mutations in cells after
DNMT1 knock-down. This refutes the suggestion by Jackson-Grusby et al (7) that 5-AzadC-induced point mutations are mediated by DNMT1.
Alternatively, 5-Aza-dC mutagenicity could be associated with hypomethylation induced by
the drug. Genome-wide hypomethylation in ES cells deficient for DNMT1 has been shown

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 13.

Maslov et al.

to lead to elevated mutation frequency (4). Although we found that 5-Aza-dC treatment at
certain doses significantly decreases the level of DNA methylation, this decrease was not
correlated with mutagenic effects of the drug. While at increased doses of up to 10 μM 5Aza-dC did induce more mutations (Figure 2a), there was no effect on methylation level,
which was found not different from the untreated control (Figure 2c). Moreover we
demonstrated that down-regulation of DNMT1 suppressed the mutagenic effect of 5-Aza-dC
without affecting methylation level of the cellular DNA. While we cannot rule out the
possibility that 5-Aza-dC-induced hypomethylation leads to increased genome instability on
the longer term, our findings do not suggest that hypomethylation and mutagenic effects of
5-Aza-dC are coupled.

Author Manuscript

One possible alternative hypothetical mechanism of 5-Aza-dC associated demethylation and
mutagenesis, which we also investigated, involves the possible activation of the AID
enzyme, induced by the genotoxic stress (20). The activated AID deaminates cytosines and
(at much lower efficiency (29)), methyl-cytosines, and converts them into uracil and
thymine, respectively. The erroneous repair of the resulting mismatches could explain
accumulation of both point mutations and rearrangements as well as hypomethylation.
However, we did not find any evidence for the up-regulation of AID expression in the MEFs
treated with 5-Aza-dC at the same conditions that showed demethylation and accumulation
of mutations. We also did not observe any effect of AID knock-down or inhibition of BER
on the mutagenicity of 5-Aza-dC, which make the possible involvement of AID in the
generation of genome rearrangements or 5-Aza-dC- induced hypomethylation unlikely.

Author Manuscript

Similar to its mutagenicity, the cytostatic effects of 5-Aza-dC treatment stem, to a large
extent, from the ability of the drug to induce DNA lesions, such as DNA-protein bulky
adducts, mismatches and abasic sites. This initiates a DNA damage response leading to cellcycle arrest and growth inhibition. Formation of the DNMT1-CpG bulky adducts leading to
stalled replication forks at the methylated CpG sites is a parallel mechanism potentiating 5Aza-dC mediated growth inhibition. This mechanism should greatly depend on the level of
DNMT1 expression and we found that the inhibitory effect of 5-Aza-dC on cell growth is
significantly attenuated after down-regulation of DNMT1 expression.

Author Manuscript

Although the biological effects of 5-Aza-dC are dose-dependent we found that there is a
plateau where further increases of applied dose lead to a minimal response in mutation
frequency, growth suppression or DSB generation. The majority of nucleoside analogues
exercise their biological effects by interfering with DNA replication (30) and 5-Aza-dC is
not an exception. It is conceivable, therefore, that a correlation between the intensity of 5Aza-dC stimulation and cellular response can be observed only while cells are capable of
replicating their DNA.
BER is considered as a primary repair mechanism coping with 5-Aza-dCs. It is conceivable,
therefore, that interventions targeting BER may affect therapeutic properties of 5-Aza-dC as
an antitumor drug. The poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is believed to play an
important role in the repair of DNA strand breaks (31). Consequently, chemical inhibitors of
PARP-1 were shown to have a substantial antitumor activity in a certain genetic background
and also to potentiate the activity of some other antitumor drugs (32). However, we found

Maslov et al.

that application of the PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib has no effect on mutagenic or cytostatic
properties of 5-Aza-dC. Although the presence of active PARP-1 accelerates repair of the
DNA SSB (33) the depletion of PARP-1 does not completely block the BER pathway, at
least for certain types of damage (34, 35). Our findings suggest that ADP-ribosylation is not
essential for repair of 5-Aza-dC associated DNA lesions. To clarify the role of BER in the
repair of 5-Aza-dC induced damages further investigation needs to be performed employing
more direct approaches affecting this repair mechanism.

Author Manuscript

Based on our results we propose the following mechanism of 5-Aza-dC-mediated growth
inhibition and mutagenicity (Figure 5). Depending on the DNA milieu, there are two
possible ways of dealing with incorporated 5-Aza-dC. The first mechanism (Figure 5, left
branch) is employed in all instances and leads to growth suppression and accumulation of
both point mutations and genome rearrangements. The second mechanism is employed only
when the drug is incorporated into a methylated CpG site (Figure 5, right branch). This
concurrent mechanism depends entirely on the presence of DNMT1 and also leads to
inhibition of cell growth through induction of the DNA damage response, but is able to
produce only one type of mutations: genomic rearrangements.

Author Manuscript

The antineoplastic activity of 5-Aza-dC is believed to have two different components (36,
37). Treatment with 5-Aza-dC has the ability to reactivate expression of epigenetically
silenced tumor-suppressing genes by inhibiting the methylation of newly synthesized DNA
thereby converting the genome of the actively dividing cells into a hypomethylated state (38,
39). Alternatively, 5-Aza-dC may act as a classic genotoxic drug, initiating a DNA damage
response (40). While 5-Aza-dC is a potent methylation inhibitor, it is clear that many of
cellular end-points associated with 5-Aza-dC treatment are methylation independent and
instead depend on the induction of DNA lesions. The ability of 5-Aza-dC to induce DNA
DSBs is greatly influenced by the level of DNMT1 in affected cells and our studies, as well
as those of others (7, 13), confirming that cells depleted for DNMT1 are less susceptible to
5-Aza-dC’s toxic and mutagenic effects. These results suggest that the particular
effectiveness of 5-Aza-dC in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes may be due to a
heightened expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a in the bone marrow of patients diagnosed
with MDS (41). Therefore, it is conceivable that the expression profile of methyltransferases
could constitute an effective prognostic factor for response to 5-Aza-dC treatment.

by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in which the size ratio of the cleaved products provides
quantitative methylation estimates for CpG sites within a target region (43). Bisulfite

Mutation analysis and mutant classification

Author Manuscript

MEFs were obtained from D13.5 embryos of lacZ transgenic mice and maintained in 10%
CO2 and 3% O2 atmosphere at 37°C in DMEM (GIBCO, CA, USA) supplemented with
10% FBS (GIBCO). Medium with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC; Sigma, MO, USA)
was prepared at the time of application and applied every 24 hours for the number of days
indicated.

DNA double-strand break detection and quantification

Mutation analysis was performed using the lacZ reporter assay as described previously (11).
Briefly, reporter plasmids were released from genomic DNA of lacZ MEFs by digestion
with HindIII restriction endonuclease, circularized, electroporated into E.coli galB-, ΔlacZ
amp, and plated in selective and non-selective conditions. A mutation frequency was
determined as the number of beta galactosidase defective versus wild-type bacterial
colonies. Analysis of mutation spectra was performed as described previously (11). Briefly,
48 E.coli colonies containing mutated plasmids were individually picked and grown
overnight for each sample. The plasmid fragment containing a mutated lacZ gene was PCRamplified and the type of mutation was determined based on the restriction pattern after
digestion with AvaI restriction endonuclease.

DNA DSBs were detected by assessment of γ-H2AX expression (i.e. phosphorylated histone
H2AX). Cells were trypsinized, fixed/permeabilized using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm™
Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) and stained with mouse
anti-H2AX (pS139) antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (BD Biosciences) for 30
min at 37°C (1:50 in Perm/Wash buffer). The percentage of γ-H2AX positive cells was
measured using a Guava EasyCyte Plus flow-cytometer (Millipore, MA, USA).

Author Manuscript

For knock-down experiments MEFs were transfected with scrambled siRNA, DNMT1
siRNA and AID siRNA (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, Thermo Fisher Scientific, CO, U
SA).ThesequencesofsiRNAstargetingDNMT1were:
GGUAGAGAGUUACGACGAA, AAGCAAUUCAUGACGAGAA,
GGUCGUGAGUGUUCGGGAA, GCUGGGAGAUGGCGUCAUA. The sequences of
siRNAs targeting AID were: CCUGUAUACACGACCGUUA,
CCUUGUACGAAGUCGAUGA, GGUGAUGAACCUCCGGAUU,
ACGCUUUGCCCAACGAAAU. The ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Pool was used as a
control. The siRNA electroporation was performed using the Nucleofector device (Lonza
Walkersville Inc., MD, USA) according to the manufacturers recommendations. Total RNA
was extracted with ZR-Duet DNA/RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA). The
relative RNA expression level was determined using StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR system
(Life Technologies Corp., CA, USA). Primers for real-time PCR were:
AAATTCTGTCCGGCTAACCA (AID forward), CACGTGTGACATTCCAGGAG (AID
reverse), AAGAATGGTGTTGTCTACCGAC (DNMT1 forward),
CATCCAGGTTGCTCCCCTTG (DNMT1 reverse), AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG
(GAPDH forward), GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCT (GAPDH reverse).
Cell proliferation assay

Author Manuscript

Relative cell number was measured with CyQUANT NF Cell Proliferation Assay Kit
(Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For RNAi
experiments cells were plated into 96-well plates 48 hours after transfection with either
scrambled or DNMT1 siRNA at a density of 3000 cells/well. After 24 hours cells were
administered medium with 5-Aza-dC and cultured for 72 hours with fresh medium
containing the drug added every 24 hours. For PARP-1 inhibition experiments cells were
plated into 96-well plates at a density of 3000 cell/well. After 24 hours cells were
administered medium with different compounds for 72 hours with fresh medium containing
the drug(s) added every 24 hours.
Statistical analysis
The p-values were calculated using a two-sample t-test (Microsoft Excel software package).
Each experiment was repeated a minimum of 3 times; representative results are shown.

(a)DNMT1 down-regulation attenuates cytotoxic/cytostatic effects of 5-Aza-dC on MEFs.
Dose-dependent effect is shown. The number of cells was determined after 72 hours of
treatment with 5-Aza-dC at the concentrations indicated; fresh medium containing the drug
was added every 24 hours. The data were normalized to non-treated control cells; n=12 for
each data point; asterisk (*) designates statistically significant difference with scrambled
siRNA controls (* - p<0.05) (b) DNMT1 down-regulation has a marginal effect on MEF
proliferation rate detected only after short-term application of BrdU. Longer BrdU treatment
revealed no difference in the uptake of labeling agent between control and DNMT1 KD
cells. The data was normalized to control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA; n=35 for
each data point. (c) DNMT1 down-regulation delays onset of γ-H2AX expression induced
by 5-Aza-dC treatment. The data are presented as a fold increase relative to non-treated
