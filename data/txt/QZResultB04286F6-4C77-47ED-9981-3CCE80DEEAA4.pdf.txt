BACKGROUND: Clinical trials in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) determine induction regimen standards. However, these
studies lack the data necessary to evaluate mortality trends over time and differences in resource utilization between induction
regimens. Moreover, these trials likely underreport the clinical toxicities experienced by patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Health
Information System database was used to identify children treated for presumed de novo AML between 1999 and 2010. Induction
mortality, risk factors for induction mortality, and resource utilization by induction regimen were estimated using standard frequentist
statistics, logistic regression, and Poisson regression, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1686 patients were identified with an overall
induction case fatality rate of 5.4% that decreased from 9.8% in 2003 to 2.1% in 2009 (P ¼ .0023). The case fatality rate was 9.0% in
the intensively timed DCTER (dexamethasone, cytarabine, thioguanine, etoposide, and rubidomycin [daunomycin]/idarubicin)
induction and 3.8% for ADE (cytarabine, daunomycin, and etoposide) induction (adjusted odds ratio ¼ 2.2, 95% confidence interval ¼
1.1-4.5). Patients treated with intensively timed DCTER regimens had significantly greater antibiotic, red cell/platelet transfusion, analgesic, vasopressor, renal replacement therapy, and radiographic resource utilization than patients treated with ADE regimens.
Resource utilization was substantially higher than reported in published pediatric AML clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Induction mortality for children with AML decreased significantly as ADE use increased. In addition to higher associated mortality, intensively timed
DCTER regimens had a correspondingly higher use of health care resources. Using resource utilization data as a proxy for adverse
events, adverse event rates reported on clinical trials substantially underestimated the clinical toxicities of all pediatric AML induction

INTRODUCTION
Outcomes in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have significantly improved over the past decade with remission
induction and overall survival rates approaching 90% and 65%, respectively.1 Cooperative group clinical trials have
played a critical role in these improved outcomes and in the reduced treatment-related mortality (TRM).2-6 In the United
States during the 1990s, these trials focused on intensively timed DCTER (dexamethasone, cytarabine, thioguanine, etoposide, and daunomycin [rubidomycin; rubomycin]/idarubicin)-based regimens. Starting in 2003, the trials shifted to
ADE (cytarabine, daunomycin, and etoposide)-based regimens. These clinical trial data have been used to estimate
TRM,7 and to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for infectious complications,8 the impact of body mass index,9 and
the impact of race/ethnicity10,11 on overall mortality and TRM.
Although these studies generated important information on induction outcomes, they lack the data needed to compare in temporal trends in regimen use and regimen-related mortality and resource utilization. In addition, cooperative
group trials depend on ascertainment and reporting of toxicities by individual centers. Although this reporting mechanism
is considered a ‘‘gold standard,’’ recent studies report that clinical trials may underestimate clinically important treatmentrelated toxicities.12,13 Thus, published adverse event rates may not accurately reflect the actual clinical experience of
patients treated on clinical trials. These limitations have led to a recent call for population-based registry studies in
AML.14

Resource Utilization in Pediatric AML/Kavcic et al

Unfortunately, population-based registries of pediatric oncology patients are not currently available in the
United States. However, administrative and billing data
can be used to establish large cohorts of patients in
which to study these important endpoints.15 In order to
compare induction mortality and resource utilization by
induction regimen, we assembled a nationally representative retrospective cohort of children treated for AML
over a 10-year period at 39 free-standing pediatric hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information
System (PHIS) database. PHIS data has been used in
more than 200 peer-reviewed publications including studies of appendicitis management,16 variation in pediatric
antibiotic usage,17 renal failure in pediatric acute myeloid
leukemia,18 and end-of-life care in children with cancer.19
PHIS data include 85% of all hospitalizations in freestanding dedicated children’s hospitals in the United States
registered by the National Association of Children’s Hospitals (D. Bertoch, personal written communication, December 8, 2010), including approximately 40% of
patients treated on the recently completed Children’s Oncology Group (COG) phase 3 trial (AAML0531) for children with newly diagnosed AML.20
We hypothesized that PHIS data could be used to
define temporal trends of chemotherapy regimen use and
induction mortality and to compare resource utilization
between induction regimens. We further hypothesized
that intensively timed DCTER induction regimens would
be more resource-intensive than the ADE regimen and
that PHIS resource utilization data would allow quantification of clinically relevant adverse events (AEs) not
reported by the clinical trials.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human Subjects

The study was approved by the Children’s Hospital Association (CHA) and received exemption status by the Institutional Review Board at the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia.
Data Source

PHIS is a comparative pediatric administrative database
including inpatient data from 42 not-for-profit, tertiary
children’s hospitals affiliated with the CHA (Overland
Park, Kan).15 PHIS data are derived from 2 primary data
sources within the participating hospitals. The hospital’s
medical record system provides patient identification,
demographics, dates of service, discharge disposition, and
up to 41 diagnosis and procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9).

The hospital’s billing system provides billed resource
utilization data for every patient for every hospital day of
service. These resource utilization data include all billed
pharmaceuticals, laboratory tests (without results), imaging procedures (without results), and supplies. Each
patient’s vital status at the time of the hospital discharge is
also recorded. Each patient is assigned a unique identifier
in the PHIS database that is preserved for all admissions.
Therefore, patients can be followed across inpatient
admissions. Oversight of PHIS data quality is a joint
effort between the CHA (data management center),
Thomson Reuters Healthcare (data processing partner),
and participating hospitals.
Study Cohort Assembly

Patients with hospital discharge dates in the PHIS database between January 1, 1999, and March 31, 2010, were
included in the study cohort. Children were included in
the study cohort if their index hospitalization was assigned
an ICD-9 code (either as a primary or secondary diagnosis) for any type of myeloid or unspecified leukemia
(205.xx: myeloid leukemia, 206.xx: monocytic leukemia,
207.xx: other specified leukemia, and 208.xx: leukemia of
unspecified cell type).21
Patients were excluded if they had been assigned an
ICD-9 discharge diagnosis code consistent with another
malignancy or had undergone hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation within 60 days of index admission. Induction chemotherapy billing data for the remaining patients
were subsequently manually reviewed and compared with
published regimens2,22,23 by a pediatric oncologist
(M.K.).15,21 Those patients not receiving chemotherapy
consistent with published AML induction regimens were
excluded. Induction regimens were categorized as 7þ3
(cytarabine and daunorubicin), ADE (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide) with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin, DAT (daunorubicin, cytarabine, thioguanine),
intensively timed DCTER (2 intensively timed cycles of
dexamethasone, cytarabine, thioguanine, etoposide, and
rubidomycin [daunomycin] or idarubicin given 10 days
apart), or other (standard timing of DCTER and other
regimens). The induction period was defined from initiation to completion of 2 courses of chemotherapy.1-3,22
Study Variables
Demographics

Demographic data (age, sex, and race) and insurance
status were defined at the first admission with chemotherapy. Age was collected in years, and sex, age, race (white,
black, Asian, Native American, other, or missing), and insurance status (private, government, self-pay, other, or
1917

unknown) were each collected as categorical variables.
Because ethnicity data were missing for a substantial number of patients, no analyses by ethnicity were conducted.
Hospital Resources Utilized

The frequency of inpatient resource use was determined for each patient based on daily billing data. Utilization frequencies were determined for the following
resources: complete blood counts, blood cultures, antimicrobial agents, blood products, opioid analgesics, antihypertensive medications, vasopressors, diuretics, antiemetics,
supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, radiology imaging, parenteral
nutrition, nasogastric tube placement, and dialysis. Each
resource variable was first dichotomized (exposure or no
exposure) for each inpatient day, then summarized as the
total number of exposure days during the induction period
for each patient.
Hospital Discharge Status

PHIS disposition data document the conclusion of
each hospitalization classified as: discharged to home, discharged to another care facility, or inpatient death. Using
these disposition data, the inpatient case fatality rate
during the induction period was calculated for each
induction regimen.
Statistical Analyses

Baseline and demographic characteristics were summarized by standard descriptive statistics. Chi-square tests
were used to evaluate for variation in the distribution of
each demographic characteristic among the 5 regimen
groups. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test
the piecewise linear trend in the mortality rate over time.
Univariate logistic regression was used to evaluate
unadjusted effects of demographic characteristics and
induction regimen on inpatient induction mortality risk.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine
the adjusted association of induction regimens with inpatient mortality controlling for patient characteristics and
time trends. Results were summarized as unadjusted and
adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). Because both the exposure of interest (regimen use)
and outcome (inpatient mortality) clustered by hospital,
adjustment for confounding by hospital was performed.
The effects of induction regimen were decomposed to
patient level and hospital level24,25 by including percent
of each regimen use in a hospital as hospital level covariates in the multivariable regression. In this adjustment, for
example, the patient level effect measures the effect of
receiving DCTER versus ADE once a child is admitted to
1918

a hospital, and the hospital level effect measures the effect
of transferring a given child from a hospital with lower to
higher percent of DCTER use.
In the resource utilization analysis, resource utilization days per 1000 inpatient days were reported. Poisson
regressions were used to compare the rates of resource utilization between different regimen groups with the
resource days as the outcome and inpatient days as the offset. To adjust for potential overdispersion in Poisson
regressions, the Pearson scale adjustment was applied.
RESULTS
Between January 1, 1999, and March 31, 2010, 1686
patients with 132,330 inpatient days (362.2 years) of observation time and presumed de novo AML were identified at 39 of 42 PHIS institutions.21 Table 1 lists patient
characteristics by induction regimen. The median age of
the patients was 7.7 years. A slight male predominance
was observed (53%), most patients were white (70%), and
more patients had government (40%) than private (34%)
insurance at their index admission. Age distribution differed significantly among regimens with nearly half
(46.5%) of patients treated with DAT being between 1
and 3 years of age (P < .0001). Values of the other baseline characteristics (sex, race, insurance status) were
equally distributed among induction regimens.
Figure 1 illustrates the variation in induction regimens and inpatient case fatality rate through the study period. Although most children (75%) were treated with
DCTER or ADE regimens, substantial variation over
time existed. In 2004, use of DAT and DCTER regimens
declined. Simultaneously, ADE chemotherapy became
more widely utilized and by 2009 comprised 87% of
induction regimens. The case fatality rate did not increase
significantly between 1999 and 2003 (6.7% versus 9.8%;
P ¼ .4813, test for trend), but substantially decreased after
2003 to a rate of 2.1% in 2009 (P ¼ .002, test for trend).
Unadjusted and adjusted ORs for induction mortality by induction regimen are shown in Table 2. Case fatality rate varied by induction regimen from 3.7% for DAT
to 9.0% for DCTER. In the fully adjusted analysis, age
was a significant predictor of induction mortality, with
infants and adolescents having higher mortality risk (OR
¼ 4.3; 95% CI ¼ 2.2-8.7, and OR ¼ 3.5; 95% CI ¼ 1.86.0, respectively). Black patients did not have a higher
likelihood of death than white patients (adjusted OR ¼
1.4; 95% CI ¼ 0.7-2.7). Patients in race group ‘‘Other’’
(Asians/Pacific Islanders, American Indians, other, and
unknown race) were twice as likely to die in induction
than white patients (adjusted OR ¼ 2.0; 95% CI ¼ 1.2Cancer

for resource utilization by induction regimen. For 22 of
the 36 resource metrics measured, patients receiving
intensively timed DCTER chemotherapy had significantly increased resource utilization compared to those
treated with ADE regimens. Notably, patients treated
with ADE were hospitalized an average of 16 fewer days,
had 50% lower rates of parenteral nutrition and patientcontrolled analgesia usage, a 30% lower rate of both blood
culture testing and vasopressor infusion administration
(norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dobutamine), and a
20% lower rate of blood product (packed red blood cell
and platelet) transfusions. Multiple other resources,
including overall antibiotic use, abdominal ultrasound,
computed tomography imaging of the head, and oral and
parenteral analgesics were also significantly decreased in
patients receiving ADE induction regimens.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare
induction mortality and resource utilization using administrative/billing data among induction regimens in children with de novo AML. Although it is a new cohort, it
has multiple characteristics demonstrating face validity.

First, the age, sex, and racial distributions are consistent
with previously published data for pediatric patients with
de novo AML.26 Second, the observed induction mortality rates are highly concordant with those published in
multiple cooperative group trial analyses.2-4,22 Finally, the
durations of hospitalization for ADE and intensively
timed DCTER regimens parallel those reported in data
from cooperative group trials.2,3
As initially hypothesized, patients receiving intensively timed DCTER regimens had a 2-fold increased
mortality. Because in-hospital mortality could be confounded by hospital level clustering of regimen and mortality, the proportion of each regimen use at each hospital
was included in the multivariable analysis. Even after
accounting for hospital clustering and adjusting for other
confounding variables, a 2-fold higher risk for induction
mortality persisted for patients receiving the intensively
timed DCTER regimens. This increase in mortality was
1920

reflected in increased resource utilization across a majority
of the resource utilization categories examined, suggesting
a concordant increase in morbidity. The published data
reporting comparable event-free survival rates in intensively timed DCTER and ADE induction regimens,2-5
and our data demonstrating significantly increased induction mortality and resource utilization with intensively
timed DCTER therapy support using ADE as the standard induction regimen in children with de novo AML.
Although the clinical trial reports have described
higher TRM with intensively timed DCTER regimens,
these reports provide very limited data on treatment complications in patients who do not experience TRM. For
example, the Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) 2961,
COG AAML031P1, and Medical Research Council
(MRC) AML12 trials did not report pain as a clinically
significant AE.2-4 However, per PHIS billing data,
patients received opioid medications an average of 1 in 4

hospital days, and the rate of patient-controlled analgesia
use in the intensively timed DCTER cohort was more
than twice that in the ADE cohort. Similarly, hypotension
as an AE is reported only on the AAML031P1 trial with
rates of 2% and 3% in induction courses I and II.3 However, PHIS billing data demonstrate that 13% of patients
received at least 2 consecutive days of vasopressor support
during induction therapy. Such discrepancies occur across
almost all resource utilization categories and exemplify
how reporting mechanisms on clinical trials substantially
and systematically underreport important clinical
toxicities.
Although other investigators have raised concerns
about AE reporting on clinical trials,13,27,28 we believe our
analysis is the first to demonstrate such marked underreporting across a wide range of specific toxicities. Work is
ongoing to compare AE rates from patients enrolled in
COG trials with AE rates estimated from resource utilization metrics. Based on the estimates of Roche et al, the most
recent COG pediatric AML trial required 8300 hours of
time to report approximately 11,000 adverse events (TA
Alonzo, personal written communication, September 20,
2011). Given the large number of AEs per patient and the
diminishing resources available for cooperative group clinical trials, the use of day-by-day resource utilization data
from administrative/billing data sources may be an
untapped resource to complement toxicity ascertainment
and consequentially improve its efficiency and accuracy.
Overall yearly inpatient induction case fatality rates
dropped 3-fold during the study period. Patients treated
from 1999 to 2003 had slightly increasing mortality by
study year, but this trend substantially reversed after 2003
when case fatality rates decreased from 9.8% in 2004 to
2.1% in 2009. The etiology of this decline in mortality is
multifactorial, but the inversely proportional use of intensively timed DCTER and ADE regimens likely contributes substantially. In addition, a ‘‘learning curve’’ effect
for the administration of pediatric AML therapy may also
have contributed to this decreased mortality.2
Age and sex were significantly associated with induction mortality. Consistent with prior publications, infants
and adolescents each had a 3-fold higher risk for induction
mortality in comparison to patients in the reference age
group ( 3 years and < 10 years).2,3,22 Prior reports have
not demonstrated increased mortality in female patients;
additional work is ongoing to further explore this finding.
Although black patients did not have higher induction
mortality, ‘‘Other’’ patients, including Asians/Pacific
Islanders, American Indians, other, and unknown race,
showed a 2-fold higher risk. Racial disparities in pediatric

cancer and particularly in childhood AML remain incompletely understood despite multiple investigations.29 Published COG and Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
Results (SEER) data have demonstrated decreased overall
survival in black patients.3,10,30 Single-institution studies
have yielded conflicting results with the most recent data
demonstrating no difference in outcome.11,31 However,
none of these reported a difference for Asians/Pacific
Islanders and American Indians. To address further
potential racial/ethnic disparities, we are working to
increase the patient cohort size and to evaluate the association between race, resource utilization, and mortality in
patients treated with ADE chemotherapy.
This cohort has a large sample size and welldelineated resource utilization information, but PHIS
administrative/billing data has limitations. First, the process of cohort assembly may include patients with a diagnosis other than de novo AML.15 However, previous
work in acute lymphoblastic leukemia would suggest that
the estimated number of such patients is small.15 Second,
because deaths occurring at non-PHIS hospitals or in the
outpatient setting were not ascertained, our analyses may
underestimate the overall induction mortality rate.
Because AML induction is delivered primarily in the inpatient setting, this potential bias is also likely modest. In
addition, the available resource administration data only
describe the services that were billed rather than the actual
services provided to the patient. Despite this potential
source of error, the relative comparison of resource intensity between regimens should be valid. Moreover, the
resource utilization data reflect the treatment burden of
each induction regimen on payors of health care. Finally,
Hispanic ethnicity data and laboratory/radiology result
data were not available for analysis, and therefore analysis
of ethnicity and disease-free survival could not be performed. The merging of Children’s Oncology Group
AML trial data with PHIS20 and the inclusion of clinical
test results from a subset of PHIS hospitals32 will help to
address these limitations in future studies.
In summary, our analysis is the first comparison of
mortality and resource utilization across multiple pediatric AML induction regimens administered in the United
States. These data demonstrate a significant decrease in
AML induction mortality after 2004 and show that
intensively timed DCTER regimens have higher induction mortality and concordantly increased use of health
care resources. In addition, the resource utilization data
indicate that adverse event rates reported on clinical trials substantially underestimate the actual resources
needed to provide de novo AML care. These results pro1922

vide support for the use of ADE-based regimens as the
standard of care for children with newly diagnosed AML
in the United States and serve as an impetus for improving adverse event monitoring and reporting on pediatric
AML clinical trials. Work is ongoing to characterize further the recent decrease in AML induction mortality and
the disparities in outcomes and resource utilization for
sex and specific minority groups receiving ADE therapy,
as well as to leverage PHIS data to supplement AE
reporting data from recently completed and ongoing
COG AML clinical trials.20
