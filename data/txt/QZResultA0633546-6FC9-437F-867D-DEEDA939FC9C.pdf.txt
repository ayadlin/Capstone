ABSTRACT
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients often present olfactory dysfunction. However, the
histopathological basis behind this has not been previously shown. Since the piriform
cortex plays a crucial role in olfaction, we hypothesize that pathological changes in
this brain area can occur in T2D patients along aging. Thus, we determined potential
neuropathology in the piriform cortex of T2D rats, along aging. Furthermore, we
determined the potential therapeutic role of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
(GLP1-R) agonist exendin-4 to counteract the identified T2D-induced neuropathology. 
Young-adult and middle-aged T2D Goto-Kakizaki rats were compared to
age-matched Wistars. Additional Goto-Kakizaki rats were treated for six weeks
with exendin-4/vehicle before sacrifice. Potential T2D-induced neuropathology
was assessed by quantifying NeuN-positive neurons and Calbindin-D28k-positive
interneurons by immunohistochemistry and stereology methods. We also quantitatively
measured Calbindin-D28k neuronal morphology and JNK phosphorylation-mediated
cellular stress. PI3K/AKT signalling was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and
potential apoptosis by TUNEL.
We show T2D-induced neuronal pathology in the piriform cortex along aging,
characterized by atypical nuclear NeuN staining and increased JNK phosphorylation,
without apoptosis.  We also demonstrate the specific vulnerability of Calbindin-D28k
interneurons. Finally, chronic treatment with exendin-4 substantially reversed the
identified neuronal pathology in correlation with decreased JNK and increased AKT
phosphorylation.
Our results reveal the histopathological basis to explain T2D olfactory dysfunction.
We also show that the identified T2D-neuropathology can be counteracted by GLP-1R
activation supporting recent research promoting the use of GLP-1R agonists against
brain diseases. Whether the identified neuropathology could represent an early
hallmark of cognitive decline in T2D remains to be determined.

drivers of the diabetes epidemic.
Previous studies showed that T2D patients have
increased odor detection threshold [2], decreased odoridentification ability [3, 4], and increased risk of anosmia
[5]. Recent studies confirmed a relationship between
T2D and olfactory dysfunction as well as the correlation
between lower olfactory scores and the presence of
diabetic complications [6, 7]. Moreover, a recent
pre-clinical work has demonstrated loss of olfactory
sensory neurons with accompanying reduced olfactory
discrimination in mice after exposure to a high-fat diet
[8]. In addition, in the same model of T2D as used in
our study (Goto-Kakizaki rats), a significantly increased
glucose utilization in the olfactory bulb has been shown
to result in increased taste aversion [9], in which olfactory
cues play a determinant role [10].
Insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, which
are two hallmarks of T2D at different stages, could be
important contributing factors in the development of T2Dinduced olfactory dysfunction and growing evidence for
the role of insulin in the modulation of olfaction has been
recently reported [11]. Obese, insulin-resistant rats have
a decreased level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in
the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex [12]. Furthermore,
insulin binding in the olfactory bulb of these rats is
decreased [13].
Despite the fact that these results clearly show
olfactory dysfunction in T2D, a specific neuropathology
responsible for this has not been previously reported.
The piriform cortex (PC) is the largest of the
olfactory cortical areas that receives direct synaptic input
from the mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory bulb via
the lateral olfactory tract. This evolutionary old, threelaminar paleocortex is critical for perception of odors
[14] since neurons located in this brain area play a crucial
role in odor coding (anterior part of the PC encodes odor
identity, whereas posterior – odor quality) [15]. There is
also growing evidence for the involvement of interneurons
in synaptic inhibition in the PC after olfactory stimulation
and recent electrophysiological studies showed that
interneurons in the PC tend to be broadly excited by a
range of different odors [16, 17]. The coded signals in
the PC are further transmitted to other CNS regions [14],
since this brain area is synaptically connected with the
endopiriform nucleus, the anterior olfactory nucleus,
olfactory tubercle, and cortical amygdala [14].
We hypothesize that olfactory dysfunction in T2D
has to be linked to a specific brain neuropathology on
histological and quantitative level. Since the PC is a key
area involved in the regulation of olfaction, the present
work aimed to identify potential neuronal pathology in the
PC of T2D rats along aging.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin
hormone, which enhances glucose-dependent insulin
secretion via a specific G-protein-coupled GLP-1 receptor
(GLP-1R) [18]. However, GLP-1 has a very short halfwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

life due to rapid degradation. Exendin-4 (Ex-4) is a stable
synthetic form of GLP-1. For these properties, it has been
developed in clinical use for the treatment of T2D [18,
19]. Besides its anti-diabetic properties, Ex-4 can cross
the blood brain barrier [20] and preclinical work supports
neuroprotective role of Ex-4 and other GLP-1R analogues
in several neurological disorders (reviewed in [21-23]).
Thus, another goal of this study was to determine the
potential efficacy of Ex-4 against T2D-induced neuronal
pathology in the PC.

RESULTS
Glycaemia and insulin deficiency are increased by
aging in GK rats
GK and Wistar rats at 3 and 13 months of age have
been monitored for fasted blood glucose and plasma
insulin levels. 3-month-old GK rats showed slightly,
but significantly higher fasting glycaemia as compared
to Wistar rats (~9mM versus ~6mM), while 13-monthold GK rats showed very high levels of hyperglycaemia
(~18mM). Plasma insulin levels were significantly lower
in GK rats already at 3 months as compared to agematched Wistar controls (~2µg/L versus ~4µg/L). At 13
months the insulin levels decreased even further in GK
rats (less than 1µg/L). The glycaemic data of Study 1 are
presented in our recent publication [24].

T2D induces atypical NeuN nuclear staining in the
piriform cortex
Sections from 3- and 13-month-old GK and Wistar
rats’ brains were stained for the specific neuronal marker
NeuN. Similarly to our previous work in the isocortex
[24], morphological observations identified a significant
proportion of NeuN-positive neurons with abnormal
NeuN distribution and large portions of the nucleus being
negative for NeuN staining in the PC of 13-month-old GK
rats (Figure 2D). This effect was not observed in the other
three experimental groups. In order to quantify this T2Dinduced effect, we counted only NeuN-positive neurons

as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [26, 27], we
determined whether this neuronal subpopulation in the
PC was negatively impacted by T2D. The results depicted
in Figure 2B revealed a not statistically significant trend
towards the reduction of Calbindin-D28k-positive neurons
already in 3-month-old GK rats versus 3- or 13-monthold Wistars. However, the PC of 13-month-old GK rats
contained a significantly lower number of CalbindinD28k-positive neurons in comparison to 3-month-old

GK rats (P<0.05) as well as to 3- and 13-month-old
Wistars (P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). In addition,
stereological quantification (Figure 2C) as well as
visual observations (Figure 2E) identified a substantial
proportion of Calbindin-D28k-positive neurons with a
dramatic reduction in neuronal branching in 13-monthold GK rats in comparison to the other three experimental
groups.

T2D induces cellular stress, but not neuronal
death in the piriform cortex

Ex-4 exerts neurotrophic effects in CalbindinD28k-positive neurons in the piriform cortex

We determined potential presence of apoptosis by
TUNEL and the potential presence of cellular stress in
the PC by quantifying the phosphorylated form of Jun-Nterminal kinase (JNK). TUNEL analysis showed no sign
of apoptosis in the four animal groups (data not shown).
However, JNK phosphorylation was enhanced in T2D rats
versus Wistar controls in both 3-month-old (P<0.0001)
and 13-month-old GK rats (P<0.01; Figure 3A).
Representative photomicrographs presenting this effect
are shown in Figure 3B. To rule out the possibility that the
T2D effect on the PC led to neuronal death, quantifications
of the total number of neurons (NeuN-positive neurons
presenting both normal and abnormal morphology) were
performed. The results showed no difference in the total
number of neurons confirming neuronal pathology rather
than neuronal death in 13-month-old T2D rats (Figure 3C).
Double-staining of NeuN/pJNK confirmed the presence of
neuronal stress in the PC (Figure 3D).

To determine the potential role of Ex-4 to counteract
the decreased number of Calbindin-D28k-positive neurons
induced by T2D in the PC, quantification of CalbindinD28k-positive neurons was performed in 9-month-old
GK rats treated for 6 weeks with Ex-4 or vehicle. Ex-4
remarkably increased the number of Calbindin-D28kpositive neurons in comparison with vehicle-treated GK
rats (Figure 5C; P<0.0001). The effect of Ex-4 seemed
to be neurotrophic as visible by increased cell body and
larger arborization of neurites (Figure 5E). Stereological
counting of the number of neuronal neurites up to the fifth
level confirmed our visual observations (Figure 5D).

Ex-4 treatment decreases T2D-induced cellular
stress in the piriform cortex
In order to understand whether the neurotrophic
effect mediated by Ex-4 in the T2D PC correlated with
decreased cellular stress, we also quantified the number
of cells positive for the phosphorylated form of JNK by
IHC. Ex-4 decreased JNK phosphorylation in 9-month-old
GK rats in comparison with vehicle (Figure 6A, P<0.01).
Representative photomicrographs demonstrating this
effect are presented in Figure 6B.

Ex-4 reduces hyperglycaemia and increases
insulin secretion in GK rats
In Study 2, 9-month-old GK rats were treated
with Ex-4 or vehicle for 6 weeks before sacrifice. Ex-4
significantly decreased blood glucose (p<0.0001; Figure
4A) and increased insulin secretion (P<0.05; Figure 4B).

The neurotrophic effect of Ex-4 correlates with
increased AKT phosphorylation

T2D-induced neuropathology in the piriform
cortex is counteracted by chronic Ex-4 treatment

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/
AKT signalling pathway plays an important role in the
regulation of neuronal function [28, 29]. To determine
whether the Ex-4-mediated neurotrophic effect correlated
with increased activation of this pathway, we quantified
the phosphorylated form of AKT by IHC in the PC of

A pilot study revealed that morphological features of
the above described neuronal pathology in 13-months-old
GK rats were already present at 9-months of age. Thus,
to determine the potential role of Ex-4 in counteracting
the identified neuronal pathology induced by T2D in the
PC, quantification of NeuN-positive neurons without
pathology was performed in 9-month-old GK rats treated
for 6 weeks with Ex-4 or vehicle. Ex-4 significantly
increased the number of normal/healthy neurons in
comparison with vehicle-treated GK rats (P<0.01; Figure
5A). The Ex-4-mediated effect is also clearly reflected
in the photomicrographs depicted in Figure 5B. We did
not find changes in the total number of neurons (NeuNpositive neurons presenting both normal and abnormal
morphology) in the PC of 9-months-old GK rats following
6-weeks of Ex-4 treatment (Figure 5A).

that receives direct synaptic input from the olfactory bulb,
which in turn receives direct input from the olfactory
epithelium, thus being a critical brain area for the
perception of odors [14]. By showing neuropathology in
the PC of the T2D brain, to our knowledge, this is the
first report to provide a histopathological basis to explain
olfactory dysfunction in T2D.
In this study, a morphological and quantitative
neuronal analysis of healthy, pre-diabetic and overtly
T2D rats of different ages identified atypical/abnormal
nuclear appearance of neurons in the PC of overtly T2D
rats, as assessed by NeuN staining. Similar findings have
been recently shown in the isocortex of T2D GK rats [24].
NeuN is an intrinsic component of the neuronal nuclear
matrix which is present in the majority of mature neurons
in the brain [30]. The precise role of NeuN is not known,
although it has been shown to be a regulator of neuronalspecific splicing [30]. Thus, although abnormal NeuN

DISCUSSION
Our results show T2D-induced neuropathology in
the PC characterized by atypical nuclear morphology and
increased cellular stress. We also demonstrate the specific
vulnerability of Calbindin-D28k-positive interneurons to
T2D. This effect was significantly counteracted by the
treatment with the GLP-1R agonist Ex-4.
Several studies have reported a relationship between
T2D and olfactory dysfunction (see Intro) leading to the
hypothesis that this brain impairment has to be linked
to a specific brain neuropathology on histological and
quantitative level. The PC is the largest cortical region

staining in the PC of GK rats cannot prove a specific and
functionally relevant negative effect of T2D in this brain
area, the results strongly point out to a potential unhealthy
state of these neurons in GK rats.
To identify which neuronal population was
mainly targeted by the T2D pathology, we focused our
studies on the calcium-binding protein Calbindin-D28k
positive GABAergic interneurons. Disrupted calcium
homeostasis has been reported in the brains of AD
patients [31] and recent works have shown the crucial
role of Calbindin-D28k in the pathogenesis of AD [27]
as well as its neuroprotective role against brain ischemia
[32]. Furthermore, the vulnerability of other subtypes
of interneurons involved in calcium homeostasis has
been shown in the PC of AD patients [33]. Our results
show a dramatic decrease (~ 50%) of Calbindin-D28kpositive neurons in the PC of the middle-aged T2D rats
versus age-matched Wistar rats. However, this effect is
likely to be the result of Calbindin-D28k down-regulation
rather than neuronal loss. This conclusion is supported by
three main evidences in the current study: 1) the count
of NeuN-positive neurons presenting both normal and
atypical morphology did not reveal any difference in total
cell number among the four groups indicating absence
of neuronal loss 2) we recorded no sign of apoptosis by
TUNEL (data not shown), and 3) the middle-age T2D rats
showed Calbindin-D28k-positive neurons with diminished
neurite arborization and perikaryon size. Altogether these
observations support a pathological state of CalbindinD28k-positive neurons. This hypothesis is also supported
by the results showing cellular stress by increased JNK
phosphorylation in T2D rats already at 3 months of age
(when hyperglycaemia starts rising [24]) suggesting that
the T2D-iduced brain pathology begins at early stages
although it does not lead to neuronal loss and apoptosis,
at least until the rats are middle-aged (13-months-old).
It remains to be determined whether prolonged cellular
stress will lead to cell death at later stages of the diabetic
pathology.
There are several obvious underlying reasons to
explain the reported detrimental effect of T2D in the PC
including hyperglycaemia, dyslipidemia, microvascular
disease and dysfunctional insulin signalling. In addition,
inflammation could play an important role causing the
identified neuronal pathology [34]. Interestingly, our
recent data in the isocortex of GK rats showed increased
microglial activation [24].
In Study 2 we show that the identified T2Dinduced neuronal pathology in the PC of 9-month old
GK rats was remarkably counteracted by 6 weeks of
treatment with the GLP-1R agonist Ex-4. Our pilot
studies revealed that GK rats had developed the identified
neuropathology already at 9 months. Therefore, in the
second experiment the intervention with Ex-4 started at
9 months of age. We administered 0.1 µg/kg Ex-4 for
6 weeks to mimic a chronic treatment in T2D patients
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

under a GLP-1R-mediated therapy. This dose of Ex-4 is
given to T2D patients and it has been previously shown
to be neuroprotective in several animal models [35].
The Ex-4 effect was likely neurotrophic since it led to
a clear enhancement in neurite arborization and cellular
body size of Calbindin-D28k-positive neurons without
increasing the total NeuN neuronal count (sum of neurons
both healthy and presenting pathological changes).
Interestingly, regulatory effects of Ex-4 on the function
of interneurons were recently reported by Korol S.V. et
al. [36]. In addition, a trophic effect of Ex-4 on neuronal
cells has also been previously shown in vitro by Perry et
al. [37]. The data could be clinically relevant since Ex-4
is used for the treatment of T2D [38, 39] and it presents
minimal side effects in humans. In addition, it can cross
the blood-brain-barrier [20]. Finally, several studies have
shown neurogenic and neuroprotective actions of Ex-4 and
other GLP-1R agonists in rodent models of PD and AD
[21, 22, 40].
To date, GLP-1R expression has not been reported
in the rat PC although a thorough expression analysis
of this brain area is lacking [41] and published results
about the effectiveness of commercially available
antibodies have been recently questioned [42]. However,
preproglucagon positive neurons have been localized
in this area [43] indicating potential GLP-1 expression.
Thus, whether peripherally administered Ex-4 (as well as
GLP-1 originating from preproglucagon positive neurons)
activates GLP-1R in the PC, or if instead these peptides
act via a GLP-1R-independent mechanism [44] remains
to be determined.
It also remains to be determined whether the effect
of Ex-4 is “directly” neurotrophic in the PC or if it is
instead indirectly mediated by increased insulin and/or
decreased glycaemia. In correlation with the neurotrophic
effect of Ex-4 in the PC, we observed a moderate increase
of AKT phosphorylation. AKT is a serine/threonine
protein kinase, which is involved in many neuronal
functions [28, 29]. Insulin is one of the main identified
factors activating AKT phosphorylation. However,
recent data has also shown that GLP-1R activation can
directly trigger AKT phosphorylation, in correlation with
neuroprotective effects [28]. Moreover, Xu W. et al. [29]
reported a marked increase in phosphorylation of AKT
in the brain of T2D rats after long-term Ex-4 treatment,
in correlation with decreased AD pathology. Indeed
glycaemia-independent neuroprotective effects caused by
Ex-4 have been previously reported [45].
Patients with T2D are more prone to develop
cognitive impairment, dementia and neurodegenerative
diseases than healthy individuals [46-49], with consequent
high medical and social costs, in addition to individual
suffering. To reduce the onset or progression of T2Dinduced neurological complications, it is therefore
fundamental to identify early hallmarks of brain
dysfunction in T2D. Interestingly, in addition to be related
5872

to T2D, olfactory dysfunction has also been shown to
occur as an early manifestation (not always diagnosed
on time) of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and
AD ([50, 51] and review: [52]). Furthermore, a recent
clinical study has shown an association between olfactory
dysfunction and decreased cognition in elderly T2D
patients [53], leading to the hypothesis that olfactory
dysfunction in T2D could represent an early marker for
future cognitive impairment. Thus, although speculative,
our data suggests that the identified neuronal pathology
in the PC of the T2D brain could also represent an early
hallmark of how T2D initiates the process of cognitive
dysfunction and neurodegeneration.
In conclusion, we have identified a peculiar
neuronal pathology in the PC of middle-aged T2D rats,
which negatively impacts interneurons. We believe
to have identified one important factor at the basis of
olfactory dysfunction in T2D. We also showed that the
identified neuropathology in the PC could be substantially
counteracted by GLP-1R activation. Whether reversing
the PC-related neuronal pathology in the T2D brain
could represent a potential pharmacological target to
treat olfactory dysfunction in diabetic patients or to even
delay T2D-related brain complications remains to be
determined.

Glycemia and insulin measurements in Exendin-4
versus vehicle-treated GK rats
Animals were fasted for 6 hours and blood glucose
was measured from tail-tip blood. The blood was also
collected in fed state and serum insulin levels were
determined by a rat insulin ELISA kit (kindly provided by
Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL USA).

Immunohistochemistry
Rats were deeply anesthetized and transcardially
perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). The brains were extracted, cut in 40-µm-thick
coronal sections and processed for immunohistochemistry
as previously described [24]. The following primary
antibodies were used: mouse anti-NeuN (1:300,
Millipore, St. Charles, MO, USA), rabbit anti-CalbindinD28k (1:1500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit antiphospho-SAPK/JNK (1:50, Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-phospho-AKT (1:25,
Cell Signaling) and rabbit anti-GLP-1R (1:50, ab39072;
Abcam). For chromogenic visualization, the ABC
kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and
3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) were used. In fluorescent doublestaining, AlexaFluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:200; Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada)
and biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200; Vector)
followed by streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 488 (1:200;
Life Technologies) were used. For apoptosis detection,
DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) was used according to manufacturer’s
instructions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and experimental groups
As an experimental model of T2D, we used male
Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, which are Wistar-derived nonobese rats that spontaneously develop T2D [54]. GK
rats are prone to peripheral neuropathy [55], behavioural
impairments [56], loss of cerebral neurons along aging
[24] and develop common T2D complications often
observed in human patients [57].

Quantitative analysis

Normal and T2D rats were used in two studies

Immunoreactive cells were counted using a
computerized setup for stereology, equipped with
NewCast software (Visiopharm, Hoersholm, Denmark),
connected to Olympus BX51 epifluorescent/light
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The number of
NeuN-, Calbindin-D28k- and pJNK-positive cells in
the PC was quantified on three evenly spaced sections
(400µm) in each animal starting at 0.70mm from Bregma
(Figure 1). Quantifications were performed using the
optical fractionator method [24, 58]. Number of neurites in
the Calbindin-D28k-positive cells was estimated in 50-60
randomly selected cells up to the fifth level of branching,
e.g. the neurites protruding from cell body were marked
as level 1 and every consecutive branching from the level
1 neurites - as level 2 and so on. The average number of

groups were analysed: 3-month-old GK (n=7), 13-monthold GK (n=6), 3-month-old Wistar (n=6), 13-month-old

given twice daily for 6 weeks before sacrifice.
Animals were housed on a 12 hours light/dark
