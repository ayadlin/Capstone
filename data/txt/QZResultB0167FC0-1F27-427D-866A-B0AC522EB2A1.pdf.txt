Abstract
Secreted frizzle-related protein 2 (SFRP2), a modulator of Wnt
signaling, has recently been found to be overexpressed in the
vasculature of 85% of human breast tumors; however, its role
in angiogenesis is unknown. We found that SFRP2 induced
angiogenesis in the mouse Matrigel plug assay and the chick
chorioallantoic membrane assay. SFRP2 inhibited hypoxia
induced endothelial cell apoptosis, increased endothelial cell
migration, and induced endothelial tube formation. The
canonical Wnt pathway was not affected by SFRP2 in
endothelial cells; however, a component of the noncanonical
Wnt/Ca2+ pathway was affected by SFRP2 as shown by an
increase in NFATc3 in the nuclear fraction of SFRP2-treated
endothelial cells. Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor that
inhibits dephosphorylation of NFAT, inhibited SFRP2-induced
endothelial tube formation. Tacrolimus 3 mg/kg/d inhibited
the growth of SVR angiosarcoma xenografts in mice by 46%
(P = 0.04). In conclusion, SFRP2 is a novel stimulator of
angiogenesis that stimulates angiogenesis via a calcineurin/
NFAT pathway and may be a favorable target for the inhibition
of angiogenesis in solid tumors. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4621–8]

Introduction
Angiogenesis is the growth of new capillary blood vessels and is
a critical component of solid tumor growth (1). Limiting
angiogenesis through blockade of vascular endothelial growth
factor has resulted in an increase in overall or progression-free
survival in patients with metastatic breast (2), colon (3), lung (4),
and renal cell carcinoma (5). There is a need for new angiogenesis
inhibitors because not all tumors respond equally well to antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy, and most tumors
eventually progress. Recognizing that tumor neovessels differ from
normal vasculature, we developed a novel method for immunolaser capture microdissection coupled with RNA amplification and
genome-wide gene expression to profile tumor vasculature cells
from human breast tumors compared with normal breast samples
(6). In our analysis, the largest sample number to date of breast
tumor vasculature, we identified 55 genes with >4-fold increased

expression compared with normal. Secreted frizzle-related protein
2 (SFRP2) mRNA was increased >6-fold in breast cancer
endothelium, and as shown by immunohistochemistry, 33 of 39
(85%) of breast tumors showed intense staining for SFRP2 in the
neovasculature. Importantly, SFRP2 was highly expressed in the
vasculature of luminal, HER-2/neu, and basal tumors (6).
In our present study, we evaluated the vascular expression of
SFRP2 in angiosarcoma, colon cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer,
ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and
pancreatic cancer and found that SFRP2 is strongly expressed in all
tumors, making SFRP2 a broad-spectrum vascular target. Based on
the expression of SFRP2 in vascular endothelium, we hypothesize
that SFRP2 stimulates angiogenesis. We sought to associate a
function with SFRP2 expression in endothelial cells using in vivo
and in vitro angiogenesis models.

Materials and Methods
Chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Fertilized chickens eggs (NC
State University Chicken Research Farm) were incubated at 100jF in an egg
turner for 4 days and then cracked into sterile Petri dishes and incubated at
99jF, 3% CO2, and 65% humidity. For application of drug onto the chick
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), Whatman grade 1 filter paper was cut
into circles with a 6 mm diameter paper punch and autoclaved, soaked in
1 mL of 3.0 mg/mL cortisone acetate in absolute ETOH, and air-dried for
60 min in laminar flow hood. On day 8, five disks per egg were placed on
outer third of CAM, 2 to 3 mm from a vessel. Control 0.1% bovine serum
albumin in PBS 7 AL was added to the discs for the control CAMs, and
recombinant murine SFRP2 (US Biologicals) 100 ng/7 AL of 0.1% bovine
serum albumin in PBS was added to the disks for the treated CAMs (n = 13
control disks and 23 SFRP2-treated disks). The CAMs were evaluated under
stereomicroscope on day 3 after disk placement. Pictures of the area around
the disk were taken with a Wild M-4 70 Macrosystem, and angiogenesis was
quantified using Metamorph Software with an angiogenesis module.
Mouse Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay. Mouse studies were
approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University
of North Carolina. The Matrigel plug assay was done as described previously
(7). Female C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old) were injected subcutaneously with
0.5 mL growth factor-reduced basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) from
BD Biosciences containing either mouse recombinant SFRP2 (800 ng/mL)
with 30 units/mL heparin (American Pharmaceutical Partners) or PBS with
30 units/mL heparin for negative control was injected subcutaneously on
the back. Two to three Matrigel plugs were injected per mouse. Seven days
later, the mice were sacrificed and the Matrigel plugs were removed and
evaluated for angiogenesis by hemoglobin concentration with the Drabkin’s
reagent as described previously (8).
Antibodies. The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology: h-catenin antibody (sc-59893; 1:500 dilution), NFATc1
(sc-7294; 1:500 dilution), NFATc2 (sc-7296; 1:500 dilution), NFATc3
(sc-8405; 1:250 dilution for Western blot and 1:100 dilution for immunohistochemistry), H-Ras (sc-29; 1:500 dilution), and FRP2 (sc-13940; 1:500

dilution for Western blot and 1:100 dilution for immunohistochemistry).
The h-tubulin loading control (ab6046) was purchased from Abcam and
used in 1:1,000 dilution. The following secondary antibodies were purchased
from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences: ECL anti-mouse IgG, horseradish
peroxidase-linked whole antibody (NA931), and ECL anti-rabbit IgG,
horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (NA934) with 1:100,000
dilution.
Cell culture. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) were
purchased from Clonetics. HCAEC were cultured in endothelial cell basal
medium-2 with BulletKit growth supplements (Clonetics). Mouse myocardial endothelial cells (MEC) from Robert Auerbach (University of
Wisconsin) were grown in low-glucose DMEM (Life Technologies) with
10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). SVR angiosarcoma cells were obtained
from Dr. Jack Arbiser (Emory University Medical School) and cultured in
low-glucose DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Endothelial cell apoptosis. HCAEC were used for apoptosis assays
because we were not able to induce apoptosis with hypoxia in the MEC.
HCAEC were grown in 10 cm dishes (Becton Dickinson) with until 80%
confluent. Medium was replaced with endothelial cell basal medium-2
without BulletKit growth supplements and 70 or 700 pmol/L SFRP2 was
added to the cells. The plate was incubated in hypoxic conditions (37jC in a
hypoxia chamber with an atmosphere of 5% CO2/94% N2 with an oxygen
level of 1.0%) for 36 h. Apoptosis was measured by the activity of cleaved
caspase-3 by using a caspase-specific fluorogenic substrate according to the
protocol for the Caspase-3 Assay Kit (Sigma).
Endothelial cell proliferation assay. MEC (2,000 per well) were
seeded on a 96-well plate in medium for 24 h. The cells were quiesced
in low-glucose DMEM with 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 18 h. Medium
was replaced with fresh low-glucose DMEM with 0.5% fetal bovine
serum and the cells were treated in triplicate with PBS alone or SFRP2
(7 nmol/L-7 pmol/L). After 24, 48, or 72 h, 10 AL of the colorimetric
compound 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(5 mg/mL) was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 4 h at
37jC. All but 25 AL medium in each well was removed and 50 AL
DMSO was added. After 10 min at 37jC, the A540 was measured using a
microplate reader.

Scratch wound assay. MEC were plated at 10,000 per well into a 96-well
plate and allowed to become confluent. The cells were quiesced in DMEM
without serum for 18 h. The wound was formed using a 1 mL pipette tip and
a 0.7 to 700 pmol/L dose curve of mouse recombinant SFRP2 was added to
the wells. Migration distance was measured using a 1 mm ocular ruler at
time points between 16 and 32 h.
Tube formation assay. Extracellular matrix (Chemicon) was thawed,
diluted, and solidified into wells of a 96-well plate according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. MEC were seeded onto the matrix at a
concentration of 1  104 per well in 150 AL DMEM with 10% fetal bovine
serum. A 7 pmol/L to 7 nmol/L dose curve of mouse recombinant SFRP2
was added to the wells and the plates were returned to 37jC, 5% CO2 for 8 h.
Images were acquired using the Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope at 4
magnification with a Nikon CoolPix 995 digital camera. Results were
quantified by counting the number of branch points.
For tacrolimus treatment experiments, MEC were treated as above with
SFRP2 30 nmol/L with and without tacrolimus (LC Laboratories) at
concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 Amol/L for 8 h and branch points
were determined as described above. Inhibition of SVR angiosarcoma tube
formation by a polyclonal antibody to SFRP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
was done after removing sodium azide from the SFRP2 antibody using
Zeba Desalt Spin Columns (Pierce Biotechnology). SVR cells were plated
onto extracellular matrix as above and a dilution curve of SFRP2 antibody
(1:10-1:10,000) was added to the wells. Results were quantified by counting
the number of branch points.
Small interfering RNA to SFRP2 in SVR angiosarcoma cells. SVR cells
were transfected with 72 Amol/L small interfering RNA (siRNA) for SFRP2
[FRP2 siRNA (sc-40001); Santa Cruz Biotechnology], which is a pool of three
target-specific 20- to 25-nucleotide siRNAs designed to knock down SFRP2
gene expression. The three sequences are 5¶-GAGAUAACGUACAUCAACA3¶, 5¶-CAAGCUGCAAUGCUAGUUU-3¶, and 5¶-CCAUGUCAGGCGAAUUGUU3¶. The sham siRNA (sc-36869; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) contains a
scrambled sequence that does not lead to the specific degradation of any
known cellular mRNA. SVR cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS.
After 72 h of transfection using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, cells were

harvested for Western blot analyses and tube formation assay. Cells were
seeded for a 4 h tube formation assay as described above.
Western blot analyses. MEC were grown to 90% confluence followed
by the change of medium with and without mouse recombinant SFRP2
(700 pmol/L). Cells were incubated for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h with SFRP2. MS1
and SVR cells were grown to 80% to 90% confluence. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted by using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic
extraction reagent (Pierce Biotechnology). The whole-cell lysates were
obtained using M-PER Mammalian Protein Extract reagent (Pierce Biotechnology) as described in the manufacturer’s manual. Protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad Protein Assay at A 595 (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). Equal amount of protein (20 Ag) was loaded onto SDS-PAGE
gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and
Western blotting was carried out using the proper primary antibody, with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as the secondary antibody. The ECL
Advance substrate was used for visualization (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences).
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to
SFRP2 was done on paraffin-embedded human angiosarcoma, colon cancer,
prostate cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma as described previously (6).
Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to NFATc3 was done on paraffinembedded human angiosarcoma. Tissues were sectioned at 8 Am, and
250 AL primary antibody (SFRP2 1:100 or NFATc3 1:100) was applied. A
negative control without primary antibody was done. Two pathologists (C.L.
and N.O.) scored each tissue section for SFRP2 and NFATc3 expression
based on intensity of stain in endothelium and percent positive endothelial
cells staining.
Tumor growth in vivo. Mouse studies were approved by Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at Emory University. SVR cells (0.5  106)
were injected into the flank of 6-week-old nude male mice obtained from
Charles River Breeding Laboratories. Treatment was initiated on the day
after inoculation. Mice received 3 mg/kg/d tacrolimus or vehicle control
suspended in 20% Intralipid (Baxter Healthcare) in a total volume of 0.3 mL
intraperitoneally and were treated daily for 19 days. Serial caliper
measurements of perpendicular diameters were used to calculate tumor
volume using the following formula: (shortest diameter)2  (longest
diameter)  0.52.
Statistics. Statistical differences for in vitro assays, Western blot
analyses, CAM assay, and mouse Matrigel plug assay were done with a
two-tailed Student’s t test, as the data from these experiments were
normally distributed, with P < 0.05 being significant. For the in vivo mouse
tumor growth experiment, differences in tumor volume over time were
analyzed with a two-way ANOVA. P V 0.05 indicated a statistically
significant reduction in tumor growth of the treated group compared with
the control group.

with hypoxia alone in HCAEC resulted in a 6-fold increase in
apoptosis compared with cells in normoxia. Hypoxia does not
induce apoptosis in MEC; therefore, the effect of SFRP2 on MEC

apoptosis was not evaluable. Addition of SFRP2 (70 and 700 pmol/L)
to hypoxic HCAEC decreased apoptosis by 55 F 9% (n = 4 per group;
P < 0.02; Fig. 3B).
MEC tube formation was induced by SFRP2 in a concentrationdependent manner at 8 h (P = 0.0006 at 7 nmol/L; n = 4 per group;
Fig. 3C). Taken together, these in vitro experiments show that SFRP2
induces migration, antiapoptosis, and tube formation, which are
important cellular processes necessary for new blood vessel
formation.
To study whether loss of function of SFRP2 would inhibit tube
formation, we used a model of a highly vascularized malignant
endothelial tumor, the SVR angiosarcoma tumor model, which was
derived from the transfection of Ras into MS1 endothelial cells. MS1
cells were previously generated by immortalizing murine endothelial
cells by expressing the temperature-sensitive large T antigen (10). On
implantation into mice, these cells form dormant hemangiomas
(10). MS1 cells were then transfected with Ras (SVR), and this cell
line forms angiosarcomas when injected into nude mice (10).

We collected protein lysates from MS1 and SVR cells and, using
Western blot analyses probing for SFRP2, found that SFRP2 was
increased in SVR cells compared with MS1 cells (Fig. 4A), which
correlated with H-RAS overexpression. We then transfected SVR
angiosarcoma cells with siRNA to SFRP2 or sham control and
evaluated tube formation in a Matrigel assay. siRNA-transfected
SVR cells had 70% fewer branch points compared with shamtransfected cells (sham control = 267 F 33 branch points and
siRNA SFRP2-transfected cells = 65 F 10 branch points; P = 0.001;
n = 4 per group; Fig. 4B). We then treated SVR cells in a tube
formation assay with a polyclonal antibody to SFRP2 and found
inhibition of SVR tube formation in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 4C).
Effects of SFRP2 on molecular signaling pathways in
endothelial cells. To begin to elucidate the molecular mechanism
of SFRP2 in angiogenesis, we first investigated whether SFRP2
inhibited the canonical Wnt pathway, because SFRP2 has been
reported to inhibit this signaling pathway in other cell types (11).

blot analyses detect an increase in SFRP2 protein in SVR angiosarcoma cell

We compared protein levels of dephosphorylated nuclear h-catenin
in control and SFRP2-treated MEC. SFRP2 (30 nmol/L) decreased
nuclear h-catenin in SFRP2- stimulated endothelial cells at
1 h (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, at 700 pmol/L, which is
the dose of SFRP2 that induced migration and tube formation in
MEC, there was no statistically significant change in nuclear hcatenin in the SFRP2-stimulated endothelial cells at 1 h (n = 6 per
group; Fig. 5A) or at 2, 4, 8, and 16 h (data not shown). This
suggests that although SFRP2 may inhibit the canonical Wnt
pathway in endothelial cells, it is likely that the angiogenic effects
of SFRP2 are being mediated through a noncanonical pathway,
because the canonical pathway was not inhibited at the lower
concentrations of SFRP2, which induce angiogenesis.
We next evaluated the role of the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+
pathway in SFRP2-induced angiogenesis. When the noncanonical
Wnt/Ca2+ pathway is activated, calcineurin dephosphorylates
NFAT in the cytoplasm, allowing NFAT to translocate into the
nucleus and act as a transcription factor (12). We found that
NFATc3 was increased at 1 h in the nuclear fraction of SFRP2treated MEC (Fig. 5B). There was no change in NFATc1 or NFATc2
in SFRP2-treated endothelial cells (data not shown). This suggests
that SFRP2 is signaling through the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway and induces
NFAT nuclear translocation in endothelial cells.
NFATc3 expression in human angiosarcoma. To correlate our
in vitro finding of increased NFATc3 expression in SFRP2-treated
endothelial cells with in vivo data, we performed immunohistochemistry with antibodies to NFATc3 on paraffin-embedded
human angiosarcomas and found that 6 of 8 tumors stained
positive for NFATc3 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Tacrolimus inhibits SFRP2-induced tube formation and
tumor growth in vivo. If SFRP2 stimulates angiogenesis via the
calcineurin/NFAT pathway, then pharmacologic inhibition of NFAT
should inhibit SFRP2-induced angiogenesis. To test this hypothesis,
we studied whether tacrolimus would inhibit SFRP2-mediated
angiogenesis. Tacrolimus (FK506) binds to the immunophlin
FKBP12. The FK506-FKBP12 complex associates with calcineurin
and inhibits its phosphatase activity, which inhibits nuclear
translocation of NFAT (13). Therefore, we treated MEC in a tube
formation assay with SFRP2 with and without tacrolimus.
Tacrolimus (1 Amol/L) inhibited SFRP2 induced MEC tube
formation by 64% (P = 0.002; n = 3 per group; Fig. 3D). Tacrolimus
was not cytotoxic to MEC, as only 5% of tacrolimus-treated cells
took up trypan blue dye (data not shown). This provides further
support for the role of NFAT in SFRP2-stimulated tube formation.
We then treated mice with SVR angiosarcoma xenografts with
tacrolimus. Treatment with tacrolimus (n = 12) at 3 mg/kg/d
intraperitoneally for 19 days was effective at suppressing the
growth of SVR angiosarcoma tumor in nude mice compared with
control (n = 12). Treatment with tacrolimus reduced mean tumor
volume by 46% at day 19 (589 F 129 versus 315 F 93 mm3; P = 0.04,
two-way ANOVA; Fig. 6A and B). There were no signs of toxicity
(no diarrhea, infection, lethargy, or weight loss) after 19 days of
treatment.

Discussion
SFRP2 belongs to a large family of SFRPs, which are related to
the Wnt signaling cascade, and has been previously implicated in
cancer. Some studies suggest that SFRP2 is an inhibitor of the Wnth-catenin pathway (11), and these data taken together with reports
of epigenetic inactivation of SFRP2 in breast cancer cell lines (14),

oral squamous cell carcinoma (15), and hepatocellular carcinoma
(16) suggest that SFRP2 may be a tumor suppresser gene. In
contrast, several studies provide evidence that suggest that SFRP2
may ‘‘induce’’ tumor growth. For example, SFRP2 has been found to
be highly induced in canine mammary gland tumors but not in
normal mammary glands (17), and overexpression of transfected
SFRP2 in breast adenocarcinoma cells increased their resistance to
apoptotic signals (18). Additionally, SFRP2 has also been found to
be produced by the majority of malignant glioma cell lines, and
SFRP2-overexpressing intracranial glioma xenografts were significantly larger than xenografts consisting of control cells in nude
mice (19). Although these studies suggest contrasting views of the
role for SFRP2 on tumor epithelium, no study to date has evaluated
the contribution of SFRP2 to angiogenesis.

SFRP2 Stimulates Angiogenesis via a Calcineurin/NFAT Pathway

We recently reported that SFRP2 is a novel tumor endothelial
marker for breast cancer and is overexpressed in the endothelium
of f85% of human breast tumors, including luminal A, basal, and
HER-2/neu subtypes (6). In this article, we now show that SFRP2 is
expressed in the vasculature of a wide variety of tumors, including
angiosarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer,
ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer, making SFRP2
a broad-spectrum vascular target. Based on its overexpression in
tumor endothelium, we hypothesized that SFRP2 stimulates
angiogenesis. We report that SFRP2 is a novel stimulator of
angiogenesis in vivo in the mouse Matrigel plug and CAM assays.
SFRP2 modulates the cellular processes involved in angiogenesis,
including endothelial cell migration, tube formation, and protection against hypoxia-induced endothelial cell apoptosis, and is
required for angiosarcoma tube formation.
SFRP2 contains a cysteine-rich domain that is homologous to
the putative Wnt binding domain. The Wnt signaling network

described in Materials and Methods. A, tacrolimus 3 mg/kg (n = 12) or control
buffer (n = 12) was injected intraperitoneally daily starting the day after tumor
implantation. Treatment with tacrolimus reduced mean tumor volume by 46% at
day 19 (589 F 129 versus 315 F 93 mm3). *, P = 0.04, two-way ANOVA.

influences biological processes ranging from developmental cell
fate to cell adhesion and apoptosis (11). Wnt proteins have
been grouped into two classes, canonical and noncanonical,
based on their activity in cell lines or in vivo assays. The core of
the Wnt pathway is the stability of h-catenin. Although SFRPs
have been regarded as inhibitors of the canonical Wnt-h-catenin
pathway (11), four recent studies have shown that SFRP2 can
act as a Wnt agonist rather than an antagonist. SFRP2 has been
found to increase nuclear h-catenin levels in (a) cardiomyocytes
exposed to hypoxia and treated with mouse recombinant SFRP2
(20), (b) MCF7 cells with stable transfectants of SFRP2 (21), (c)
mammary canine tumors with increased expression of SFRP2
(17), and (d) hypoxic adipose tissue-derived stem cells (22). Our
study in endothelial cells show that, at the dose of SFRP2 that
induces angiogenesis, there is no change nuclear h-catenin, suggesting that h-catenin is not responsible for the angiogenic
actions of SFRP2. This led us to investigate whether the angiogenic effects of SFRP2 are mediated through a noncanonical Wnt
pathway.
Noncanonical Wnts activate other signaling pathways, such as
the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway (23). The Wnt/Ca2+ pathway is a h-cateninindependent pathway for which signaling is mediated through
Wnt5a binding to the frizzled 5 transmembrane receptor, which
leads to a transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium. This
subsequently activates the phosphatase calcineurin. Activated
calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, which then translocates to
from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The NFAT family consists of
four members (NFATc1-c4), which exist as transcriptionally
inactive, cytosolic phosphoproteins (12). NFAT nuclear localization
is dependent on a dynamic import-export balance between the
activity of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, and the activity of serine/threonine kinases (12). NFAT
cannot normally enter the nucleus until it is dephosphorylated but
can be activated by calcineurin. Loss-of-function mutants have
shown that NFAT signaling is crucial for normal heart valve and
vascular development during embryogenesis (12, 24). Postnatally,
this pathway contributes to the regulation of cell growth,
differentiation, and cell cycle progression in various cell types,
and there are increasing data supporting a critical role of NFAT in
mediating angiogenic responses (25, 26). Importantly, NFAT
activation was identified as a critical component of vascular
endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis and linked to the
induction of cyclooxygenase-2, which is also a critical player in
angiogenesis. NFAT is a crossing point for the endothelial cell
survival pathways initiated by proangiogenic vascular endothelial
growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (26). Based on
these observations, we hypothesized that SFRP2 activates NFAT in
endothelial cells.
We found that NFATc3 protein was increased in the nucleus
after treatment of endothelial cells in vitro with SFRF2 and was
present in human angiosarcomas that also expressed SFRP2.
Angiosarcoma is a biologically aggressive vascular malignancy with
a high metastatic potential and subsequent mortality. The 2- and
5-year overall survival for all patients with angiosarcoma is 50%
and 30%, respectively, with a median overall survival of 24 months
(27). There is a desperate need for novel therapies to improve
survival in patients with this highly lethal disease, and our findings
suggest that targeting NFAT may be therapeutic strategy for
angiosarcoma.
Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that binds to the
immunophlin FKBP12. The FK506-FKBP12 complex associates

with calcineurin and inhibits its phosphatase activity, which
inhibits nuclear translocation of NFAT (13). We found that
tacrolimus inhibited SFRP2-induced tube formation in vitro and
the growth of angiosarcoma xenografts in vivo, suggesting that
SFRP2 induces tube formation via a calcineurin-dependent NFAT
pathway. Tacrolimus has previously been shown to inhibit growth
of a leukemia cell line in mice (28), and our report is the first to our
knowledge to show that tacrolimus inhibits angiogenesis in vitro
and solid tumor growth in vivo. The mechanism of tacrolimus
needs to be distinguished from other drugs used to prevent
transplant rejection that are being studied in clinical trials for
cancer, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and everolimus (RAD001, a
derivative of rapamycin). These drugs have the same intracellular
target as tacrolimus, FKBP12, but unlike tacrolimus these drugs
inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin and have no effect on
NFAT (29).
In summary, SFRP2, a secreted protein overexpressed in the
vasculature of a large variety of human tumors, is a novel
angiogenesis stimulator. Our data suggest that SFRP2 mediates
angiogenesis via a calcineurin-dependent NFAT pathway and that
