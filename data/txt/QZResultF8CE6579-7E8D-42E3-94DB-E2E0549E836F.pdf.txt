ABSTRACT
Platinum resistance has long been a major issue in the treatment of various
cancers. We previously reported that enhanced annexin A4 (ANXA4) expression, a
Ca2+-regulated phospholipid-binding protein, induces chemoresistance to platinumbased drugs. In this study, we investigated the role of annexin repeats, a conserved
structure of all the annexin family, responsible for platinum-resistance as well
as the effect of knockdown of ANXA4. ANXA4 knockdown increased sensitivity to
platinum-based drugs both in vitro and in vivo. To identify the domain responsible
for chemoresistance, ANXA4 deletion mutants were constructed by deleting annexin
repeats one by one from the C terminus. Platinum resistance was induced both in
vitro and in vivo in cells expressing either full-length ANXA4 or the deletion mutants,
containing at least one intact annexin repeat. However, cells expressing the mutant
without any calcium-binding sites in the annexin repeated sequence, which is
essential for ANXA4 translocation from the cytosol to plasma membrane, failed to
acquire platinum resistance. After cisplatin treatment, the intracellular chloride ion
concentration, whose channel is partly regulated by ANXA4, significantly increased in
the platinum-resistant cells. These findings indicate that the calcium-binding site in
the annexin repeat induces chemoresistance to the platinum-based drug by elevating
the intracellular chloride concentration.

[10-12]. Several proteins have been reported to be
candidate factors such as copper transporters: CTR1[13],
ATP7A and ATP7B[14-17]; multidrug resistance protein
2 (MRP2) [18-20]; glutathione S-transferase enzyme
π (GSTπ) [21]; excision cross-complementing gene 1
(ERCC1) [22]; receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) [23];
microRNAs [24-26]; and p53 [27]. In contrast, there are
still several proteins related to platinum resistance without
a full understanding of how these proteins help cells to
confer platinum-based drugs.
We recently reported that annexin A4 (ANXA4)
is overexpressed in ovarian clear cell carcinoma and

Since cisplatin was first introduced as an anticancer
drug in the 1970s [1], various platinum-based drugs
have been developed and widely used not only against
gynecological but also against other cancers, including
lung, colorectal, testicular, prostate and bladder cancer [26]. Although these platinum-based drugs have significantly
contributed to improve survival rates, chemoresistance to
these drugs has become a major problem in recent years
[7-9]. It has now been elucidated that the mechanism
of platinum resistance is mediated by reduced platinum
accumulation, increased platinum detoxification, increased

Annexins are calcium-regulated and negatively charged
phospholipid membrane-binding proteins. The basic
structure of annexins consists of 2 major domains: a
conserved structural element called an annexin repeat,
a segment of 70 amino acid residues at the C terminus,
and the N-terminal region unique for a given member of
the family and determining individual annexin properties
in vivo. The annexin repeat possesses the calcium and
membrane binding sites and is responsible for mediating
the canonical membrane binding properties [29].
These domains in ANXA4 are surrounded by relatively
short amino and carboxy termini that do not have any
known function [30]. ANXA4 is involved in membrane
permeability, exocytosis and regulation of chloride
channels in a calcium-dependent manner [29, 31-33].
ANXA4 is almost exclusively expressed in epithelial cells
[34]. With regard to cancer, ANXA4 overexpression has
been reported in various tumours, such as lung, gastric,
colorectal, renal, pancreatic, ovarian and prostate cancer
[28, 35-39] and is associated with tumour invasiveness,
metastasis and chemoresistance [37, 40]. Moreover,
ANXA4 has been shown to be associated with resistance
to platinum-based drugs [28, 41-43].
ANXA4-induced platinum resistance appears
to be mediated in part by the increased extracellular
efflux of platinum mediated by the copper transporter
ATP7A[28, 44]. Another mechanism of ANXA4induced chemoresistance is the modulation of NF-κB
transcriptional activity [45]. ANXA4 suppresses NF-κB
transcriptional activity through interaction with the p50
subunit in a calcium-dependent manner; ANXA4 causes
resistance to apoptosis induction by etoposide.
While ANXA4 prominently associated with
chemoresistance, the functional domain of ANXA4
remains unclear. Therefore, to clarify the functional
domain of ANXA4 is required to understand detailed
mechanisms of the chemoresistance induced by ANXA4
and also overcome chemoresistance. In this study, focusing
on platinum resistance, we aimed to identify the ANXA4
domain relevant to chemoresistance with regard to its
structure as well as to test whether knockdown of ANXA4
expression could improve platinum resistance. Our data
showed that the annexin repeat plays an important role in
platinum resistance induced by ANXA4, which occurs in
a calcium-dependent manner.

ovarian cancer cells using western blotting. ANXA4
expression was strong in clear cell carcinoma cell lines
(OVTOKO, OVISE and RMG-I) compared with serous
adenocarcinoma cell lines (A2780, OVCAR3 and
OVSAHO) and a mucinous adenocarcinoma cell line
(MCAS; Fig. 1A). To see whether blocking ANXA4
expression was a valid chemosensitising strategy for
ovarian clear cell carcinoma treatment, ANXA4 was
stably suppressed using an ANXA4 shRNA plasmid.
We established RMG-I-Y4 and R5 cell clones as well
as RMG-I NC7 cell clones transfected with the empty
vector as a control. Compared with RMG-I NC7 and
untransfected control parent RMG-I cells, ANXA4
expression was markedly down-regulated at the protein
level in RMG-I-Y4 and RMG-I-R5 cells (Fig. 1B). In the
absence of any drug treatment, the growth rate among the
4 cell lines was similar in vitro (data not shown).

Knockdown of ANXA4 expression enhances
sensitivity to cisplatin and carboplatin
The sensitivity to cisplatin and carboplatin was
assessed in the 3 RMG-I clones NC7, R5 and Y4.
Compared with the IC50 for cisplatin in NC7 cells, IC50
was significantly decreased in Y4 cells and R5 cells (p <
0.01; Fig. 1C, left panel). Similarly, IC50 for carboplatin
significantly decreased in Y4 cells and R5 cells compared
with NC7 cells (p < 0.01; Fig. 1C, right panel). IC50 for
cisplatin and carboplatin decreased approximately 2-fold
because of the knockdown of ANXA4 expression.

shows the structure of each deletion mutant. Full-length
ANXA4, 3 ANXA4 deletion mutants or the empty vector
were transfected into NUGC3 cells, whose endogenous
ANXA4 expression is relatively low (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Therefore, we established cell lines stably
overexpressing full-length ANXA4 (FL-22), each ANXA4
deletion mutant (R3-6, R2-13 or R1-12) or the empty
vector (NC-14). Expression of each ANXA4 deletion
mutant was confirmed using Western blotting (Fig. 3B).
Subsequently, the sensitivity to the platinumbased drugs cisplatin and carboplatin was assessed. Cells
transfected with full-length ANXA4 and the 3 deletion
ANXA4 mutants were significantly more resistant to both
cisplatin and carboplatin compared with control cells,
approximately with a 1.7- to 2.2-fold increase in IC50 for
cisplatin (p < 0.01) and a 1.4- to 1.7-fold increase in IC50
for carboplatin (p < 0.05; Fig. 3C).
To test whether these deletion mutants induce
platinum resistance through regulating cellular drug
concentration as previously reported [28], we quantitated
the intracellular platinum content of each deletion
mutant-transfected cell clone after cisplatin treatment,
which is one of the most representative platinum drugs.
Platinum accumulation was significantly reduced in cells
overexpressing either full-length ANXA4 or any of the 3

To determine whether ANXA4 knockdown in
clear cell carcinoma cells improved platinum sensitivity
in vivo, NC7 and Y4 cells were subcutaneously injected
in ICR nu/nu mice. One week after inoculation with the
tumour cells, the mice were randomised into 2 groups
and received cisplatin or PBS i.p. twice a week for 4
weeks. The tumour growth rate in the absence of drugs
was similar for both cell lines (Figs. 2A and 2B). Cisplatin
treatment had very little effect on NC7 cells (Fig. 2A), but
tumour volume markedly decreased in Y4 cells (Fig. 2B).
Cisplatin treatment significantly decreased tumour growth
in Y4 cells (87.4 ± 1.8%) compared with NC7 cells (-1.1
± 18.0%; p < 0.01; Fig. 2C). These results showed that
ANXA4 knockdown in the RMG-I cell line significantly
attenuated resistance to cisplatin in vivo.

These results suggested that the decreased intracellular
platinum contents were associated with platinum
resistance of the cells transfected with ANXA4 full length
and each deletion mutant.

annexin repeat sequence was involved in chemoresistance,
another deletion mutant, R1(E70A) was constructed.
Within the annexin repeat next to the N-terminal region,
the 70th amino acid, glutamic acid, was responsible
for the calcium-dependent activity of ANXA4 [30].
Accordingly, at this site, the point mutation variant of R1,
R1(E70A), loses the function of its calcium-binding site
(Fig. 4A). Similar to other deletion mutants, R1(E70A)
was transfected into NUGC3 cells and designated
R1(E70A)-95. Western blotting revealed that R1-12 had
the same molecular weight as R1(E70A)-95 (Fig. 4B).
R1(E70A)-95 did not induce resistance to either cisplatin
or carboplatin (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the intracellular
platinum content of R1(E70A)-95-transfected cells did
not decrease compared with that of NC-14 cells after 0 hr

R1-12 or R1(E70A)-95 cells. Mice in each group were
randomised into 2 subgroups and received either cisplatin
at 3 mg/(kg∙d) or PBS i.p. once a week for 3 weeks.
Cisplatin markedly decreased tumour volume in mice
injected with NC-14 and R1(E70A)-95 cells, whereas the
treatment effect was relatively smaller in mice injected
with FL-22 and R1-12 cells (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the
tumour volume, tumour growth was significantly inhibited
by cisplatin in mice inoculated with NC-14 (96.5 ± 1.3%)
and R1(E70A)-95 cells (87.8 ± 11.4%) compared with

and only the aquated forms of cisplatin covalently
bind to DNA. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of [Cl−]
elevation because of cisplatin treatment have not been
i
fully elucidated. We hypothesised that an increase in
intracellular Ca2+ concentration after cisplatin exposure
would result in translocation of ANXA4 from the cytosol
to plasma membrane, which leads to [Cl−]i accumulation
through inhibition of the chloride channel by the Ca2+bound ANXA4. To confirm this hypothesis, we quantified
[Cl−]i after cisplatin treatment using MAQE fluorescence,
a fluorescent Cl− indicator. Relative fluorescence was
substituted for [Cl−]i as previously reported [48].
We monitored MQAE fluorescence in control cells
(NC-14), in cells overexpressing full-length ANXA4 (FL22) and in 2 deletion mutants (R1-12 and R1[E70A]-95).

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of

the chloride channel because one of the functions of
ANXA4 is inhibition of calcium-dependent chloride
conductance[32]. According to the literature, treatment
with cisplatin induces an increase of the intracellular
Ca2+ concentration [46], which is an important ion for
the phospholipid membrane-binding activity of ANXA4.
In contrast, cisplatin exposure also induces an elevation
of the intracellular chloride concentration: [Cl−]i [47].
Elevation of [Cl−]i has been shown to prevent the aquation

treatment with cisplatin for 30 min (F30) is shown in
Figure 6. The inverse ratio of MQAE fluorescence 1/
(F30/F0), which is directly proportional to the increase in
[Cl−]i, was significantly elevated in the platinum-resistant
cell clones FL-22 (1.12 ± 0.03) and R1-12 (1.12 ± 0.01)
compared with sensitive clones, NC-14 (1.06 ± 0.01) and
R1(E70A)-95 (1.06 ± 0.02; p < 0.01). Thus, the increase in
[Cl−]i is likely to be involved in cisplatin resistance.

Together with this and the data by Chan et al., elevation
of intracellular calcium concentration induced by cisplatin
treatment may translocate Ca2+ bound form of ANXA4
from cytosol to plasma membrane, which results in
platinum-resistance[32]. We are currently investigating
on further analysis.
By analysing the intracellular platinum
accumulation, we attempted to elucidate the mechanism
of the platinum resistance induced by ANXA4 and its
deletion mutants. When intracellular platinum contents
were quantitated just after exposure to cisplatin or 3 hr
incubation with cisplatin-free medium after exposure to
cisplatin, significantly less platinum accumulated in cells
transfected with the full-length ANXA4 (FL-22) and 3
deletion mutants (R3-6, R2-13 and R1-12), all of which
enhanced the resistance to the platinum-based drugs. In
contrast, R1(E70A)-transfected cells (R1[E70A]-95),
which did not induce chemoresistance, had the same
amount of platinum accumulation as the control cells
(Figs. 3D and 4D). These results suggest that the
resistance to the platinum-based drugs is mediated by the
decrease in intracellular platinum accumulation, which is
calcium dependent. The annexin repeats, especially their
calcium-binding sites, may be involved in inhibition of
the influx, promotion of the efflux or both of platinum
drugs. Recently, Cu transporters (CTR1 for the uptake and
ATP7A and ATP7B for the efflux) have been reported to
be involved in resistance to both cisplatin and carboplatin
[14, 44, 51]. In addition, ANXA4 likely enhance platinum
efflux through the interaction with ATP7A [44]. The
possible mechanisms of inhibition of the influx mediated
by ANXA4 remains unclear and further analyses are
needed.

DISCUSSION
ANXA4 has been reported to be strongly expressed
and involved in chemoresistance in various cancers. The
factors associated with ANXA4-induced chemoresistance
have been reported, such as NF-κB [45] and ATP7A
[44], but the structure of the protein, i.e. annexin repeats
and calcium-binding sites in the annexin repeated
sequence, has not been taken into account in relation to
the ANXA4-induced chemoresistance. In this study, we
showed that ANXA4 knockdown improved sensitivity
to platinum drugs, and annexin repeats were involved in
chemoresistance.
We first confirmed ANXA4 expression in various
ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines. As previously
reported [28, 49], ANXA4 is significantly upregulated
in clear cell carcinoma cell lines (OVTOKO, OVISE
and RMG-I) compared with other histological types
(serous and mucinous adenocarcinoma cell lines: A2780,
OVCAR3, OVSAHO and MCAS). It has been previously
demonstrated that enhanced ANXA4 expression induces
platinum resistance both in vitro and in vivo [28, 44],
but whether ANXA4 knockdown attenuates platinum
resistance has been unknown thus far. Mogami et al.
recently reported that an ANXA4 knockdown improves
sensitivity to carboplatin in vitro using 2 cell lines of
ovarian clear cell carcinoma, OVTOKO and OVISE.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to
show that ANXA4 knockdown markedly improves the
sensitivity to platinum-based drugs not only in vitro but
also in vivo (Figs. 1 and 2).
The result that ANXA4 knockdown improves
sensitivity to platinum-based drugs suggests that ANXA4
is a good therapeutic target. To identify the functional
domain(s) of ANXA4 that could be a promising therapeutic
target, we focused on annexin repeats and constructed 4
deletion mutants (R3, R2, R1 and R1[E70A]). Resistance
to platinum drugs was enhanced in cells transfected with
mutants possessing at least 1 intact annexin repeat. In
contrast, the sensitivity to platinum-based drugs improved
among the R1(E70A)-transfected clones because in those
cells, the calcium-binding site did not function properly
(Figs. 3C and 4C). This result implies that the ANXA4induced chemoresistance to platinum-based agents is
calcium dependent. It has been reported that cisplatin
induced increase of intracellular calcium concentration in
chemosensitive cells, but not in resistant cells [46, 50].

cisplatin. The fluorescence pre-treatment and during treatment
(30 min exposure) was compared in each cell clone. Data are
presented as mean ± SD (*p < 0.01).

Subsequently, the question regarding the
involvement of calcium-binding site in the platinum
resistance arose. To answer this question, we measured
[Cl−]i after cisplatin exposure. The significant increase in
[Cl−]i was observed in the cells with platinum resistance,
FL-22 and R1-12, compared with cell clones without
platinum resistance, NC-14 and R1(E70A)-95. In a
previous study, higher [Cl−]i was observed in cisplatinresistant cells compared with sensitive cells, whereas the
intracellular cisplatin accumulation showed the opposite
pattern [47]. These results, in addition to the results of
decreased platinum accumulation in resistant mutants,
indicate that ANXA4 induces platinum resistance through
cellular drug efflux partly by elevating the intracellular
chloride concentration. We report ‘partly’ because
only cisplatin, not carboplatin, was tested in our [Cl−]i
assay. Cisplatin becomes intracellularly activated by the
aquation of 1 or 2 of the 2 chloride coordination sites, but
carboplatin does not contain any chloride coordination
sites [1, 52-54]. Thus, this mechanism of resistance
through elevation of [Cl−]i may be specific to cisplatin and
may not be true of carboplatin resistance. In this study, 3
cell clones overexpressing a deletion mutant (R3-6, R213, and R1-12) show stronger tolerance to cisplatin than
to carboplatin in terms of their IC50; a 1.7- to 2.2-fold
increase for cisplatin and only a 1.4- to 1.7-fold increase
for carboplatin (Fig. 3C). It is assumed that the increase
in [Cl−]i is one of the factors inducing cisplatin resistance.
In this study, the calcium-binding site in the
annexin repeat next to the N terminus was observed to
be responsible for the resistance to the platinum drugs.
Nevertheless, the role of the other 3 calcium-binding sites
has not yet been investigated. The roles of individual
calcium-binding sites were demonstrated using sitedirected mutagenesis by Nelson and Creutz regarding
calcium-dependent membrane binding and aggregation
[30]. The mutations in each domain had different effects
on the binding or aggregating activities, i.e. a mutation
in the first or fourth domain had a greater effect on
membrane binding. A mutation in the second domain
had a stronger effect on membrane aggregation, whereas
the mutation of the third domain was almost silent.
Although the mechanisms involved in membrane binding/
aggregation and the mechanisms of chemoresistance are
likely different, our data could provide some clues to
understanding the function of each annexin repeat and
each calcium-binding site in chemoresistance.
ANXA4 has been shown to induce resistance to
paclitaxel and platinum-based drugs [55]. The effect of
ANXA4 knockdown on paclitaxel sensitivity was assessed
in a previous study. The effect of sensitivity to paclitaxel
varied among different cell clones: ANXA4 knockdown in
the OVTOKO cell line with acidic isoelectric point (IEPs)
did not improve the sensitivity to paclitaxel, whereas
OVISE cell lines with basic IEPs showed improved
sensitivity to paclitaxel [43]. In our own preliminary data,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

significant chemosensitisation to paclitaxel and etoposide
was confirmed in RMG-I Y4 and R5 (data not shown).
Further studies are required to identify the detailed
mechanism.
In summary, in this study, we observed the annexin
repeat, especially its calcium binding site, was associated
with platinum-resistance induced by ANXA4, and it
happened in calcium-dependent manner. Our findings may
help to understand the mechanisms of platinum resistance
induced by other annexin family proteins, which possesses
the same annexin repeat structure, and offer new strategies
for the treatment of chemoresistant cancers.

METHODS
Cell lines and culture
The human ovarian serous adenocarcinoma cell line
(OVSAHO), human ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma
cell line (MCAS), human ovarian clear cell carcinoma
cell lines (OVTOKO, OVISE and RMG-I) and human
gastric cancer cell line (NUGC3) were obtained from the
Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Osaka,
Japan). A2780 cells from the human ovarian serous
adenocarcinoma were obtained from the European
Collection of Animal Cell Culture (Salisbury, Scotland)
and OVCAR-3 cells from another human ovarian serous
adenocarcinoma were from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). MCAS cells were maintained
in the DMEM medium and the others in the RPMI
medium, all supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum
(FBS; Serum Source International, NC, USA) and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. All the
cell lines were tested and authenticated.

Generation of ANXA4 knockdown cell lines
To generate stable ANXA4 knockdown cell
lines, RMG-I cells were transfected with a commercial
plasmid vector expressing short heparin RNA (shRNA)
that targeted ANXA4 mRNA or a negative control
nonspecific shRNA (SuperArray Bioscience Corp.,
KH06928N; Frederick, MD, USA) using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After selection using a culture
medium containing geneticin (600 µg/mL; Invitrogen),
stable clones were maintained in 250 µg/mL geneticin.
Two stable RMG-I-ANXA4 shRNA cell clones were
established, designated Y4 and R5 cells. In addition,
we transfected the empty vector into the RMG-I cell
line using the same procedure to generate control cells,
designated NC7.

Using pcDNA3.1-ANXA4 as a template, fulllength cDNA of ANXA4 was amplified using KODplus (Toyobo Co. Led., Osaka, Japan) with the primers
forward
5′-TTGACCTAGAGTCATGGCCA-3′,
reverse 5′-ATCATCTCCTCCACAGAGAA-3′ and
subsequently ligated into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO

set out to generate an R1 mutant (the E70A mutation),
whose calcium-binding site does not work because of
the change of a negatively charged carboxyl group to a
neutral side chain, as previously described [30]. The sitedirected mutagenesis was performed using the KOD-PlusMutagenesis kit (Toyobo), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. These cDNA fragments, including full-length
gene, were subsequently inserted between the Bgl II and
EcoR I sites of the pIRES2AcGFP vector (Clontech,
Palo Alto, CA). The sequences of all the mutants were
confirmed using the ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyser
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).
Full-length ANXA4, each ANXA4 deletion mutant
construct and the empty vector were transfected into
NUGC3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Stable transfectants designated FL-12, R3-6, R2-13, R112, R1(R70A)-95 and NC-14 were obtained by selection
in a medium containing geneticin and were maintained in
the same manner described above.

Cells were suspended in the RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, seeded in 96-well plates
(1,500/well for the RMG-I series and 2,500 cells/well for
ANXA4 deletion mutant series), cultured for 24 h and
exposed to various concentrations of cisplatin (0–25 µM;
Sigma–Aldrich, St Louis, MO) or carboplatin (0–1000
µM; Sigma–Aldrich) for 72 h. Cellular proliferation
was subsequently evaluated using the WST-8 assay, i.e.
2-(2-methyosy-4-nitro-phenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4disulfophynel)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt assay
(Cell Counting Kit-SF; Nacalai Tesque) after treatment.
The absorption of WST-8 was measured at a wavelength
of 450 nm (reference wavelength: 630 nm) using a Model
680 microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). Absorbance values for the treated samples were
expressed as percentages relative to results for untreated
controls, and IC50 values were calculated.

platinum

Full-length ANXA4-transfected cells (FL-22), each
ANXA4 deletion mutant-transfected cell clone (R3-6, R213, R1-12 and R1[E70A]-95), and control cells (NC-14)
were cultured up to 80% confluence in 150-mm tissue
culture dishes. The cells were then exposed to 100 µM
cisplatin for 60 min at 37°C and washed twice with PBS
either immediately or after 3 hr of incubation in cisplatinfree RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
Whole-cell extracts were prepared, and the concentration
of intracellular platinum was determined using an Agilent
7500ce inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer
(ICP-MS; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

In vivo model of cisplatin resistance
All animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with the Institutional Ethical Guidelines
for Animal Experimentation of the National Institute
of Biomedical Innovation (Osaka, Japan). Female
Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) nu/nu mice were
obtained from Charles River Japan (Yokohama, Japan).
Injection of the ANXA4 knockdown cells was performed
as follows: ICR nu/nu mice at 4 weeks of age were
subcutaneously inoculated (into the flank of the mice;
n = 6 per group) with 2.5 × 106 cells of RMG-I NC7
cells or RMG-I-Y4 cells in the total volume of 100 µL
of 1/1 (v/v) PBS/Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford,
MA). Injection of ANXA4 mutant-transfected cells, i.e.
mice at 5 weeks of age were inoculated with 106 cells of
NC-14, FL-22, R1-12 or R1(E70A) in the same manner

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1× phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Nacalai Tesque) and 1× protease inhibitor
cocktail (Nacalai Tesque)), followed by centrifugation
(13,200 rpm, 4°C, 15 min). Soluble proteins in the
supernatant were separated using sodium dodecyl
sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described
previously [28]. Additional information can be found in
the Supporting Information on Material and Methods
section.

as with the ANXA4 knockdown cells. Treatment with
cisplatin (3 mg/kg) or PBS i.p. was initiated 1 week after
inoculation and administered twice weekly for 4 weeks
(ANXA4 knockdown cells) and once a week for 3 weeks
(ANXA4 mutant-transfected cells). Tumour volumes
were determined twice weekly by measuring length (L),
width (W) and depth (D) and using the following formula:
tumour volume (mm3) = W × L × D.

[Cl−]i measurements
[Cl−]i was measured using the fluorescent Cl−
indicator N-ethroxycarbonymethyl-6-methoxyquinolinium
bromide (MQAE; Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). [Cl−]i is
detected by the mechanism of diffusion-limited collisional
quenching of MQAE fluorescence. MQAE fluorescence
intensity inversely correlates with [Cl−]i. The cells of the
ANXA4 deletion mutant series (NC-14, FL-22, R1-12
and R1[E70A]-95) were cultured in 35-mm tissue culture
dishes up to 20% confluence and incubated with a medium
containing 10 mM MQAE for 4 h at 37°C. After loading,
the cells were washed 5 times with Cl−-free buffer and
electrically stimulated under a microscope at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Fluorescence
measurements were initiated immediately at the indicated
periods using Biozero BZ-9000 (Keyence, Tokyo, Japan)
at 510/40 nm excitation and 380/50 nm emission. The
fluorescence was quantitated by means of a standardised
procedure using a BZ-II Analyser (Keyence), and the
data were presented as the reciprocal of the ratio of
fluorescence data (F0/F30) to identify possible correlations
with the increase in [Cl−]i..
