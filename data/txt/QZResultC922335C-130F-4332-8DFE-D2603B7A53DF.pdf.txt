ABSTRACT
In this study, we investigated anti-tumor activity and associated molecular
mechanism of action of Salicylate •Phenanthroline Copper (II) Complex in triplenegative breast cancer. Salicylate •Phenanthroline Copper (II) Complex inhibited
the growth of four breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231 and BT-20)
and induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect was more
profound in MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Western
blot showed that the expression of the apoptosis-related protein Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and
survivin was significantly reduced in MDA-MB-231 after treatment with Salicylate
•Phenanthroline Copper (II) Complex. In vivo, Salicylate •Phenanthroline Copper
(II) Complex administration significantly attenuated tumor growth of MDA-MB-231
xenografts, and the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin were reduced
as measured by immunohistochemical staining. These data suggest that Salicylate
•Phenanthroline Copper (II) Complex is a promising novel therapeutic drug for triplenegative breast cancer and warrants further study.

INTRODUCTION

the overall survival (OS) rate is still lower compared to
non-TNBC patients [2]. TNBC recurrence typically peaks
within three years after treatment, and most patients do
not survive beyond five years, although the gap between
TNBC and non-TNBC survival decreases after ten years
[1, 6]. When pathologic complete response (pCR) was not
achieved in TNBC patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
a significantly poorer OS was observed compared to nonTNBC patients with residual disease [7]. Compared with
non-platinum-based chemotherapy, platinum-based agents
can significantly improve the pCR rate [8, 9], although a
benefit in OS remains to be seen [10]. Importantly, although
most TNBC tumors respond well to chemotherapy initially,
they often develop drug resistance [11]. Therefore, there is
an urgent need to develop new therapeutic agents for TNBC.
Tumors are characterized with uncontrolled proliferation
and a suppression of apoptosis, thus targeting those processes

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts
for 10% to 20% of all breast cancer cases. TNBC is
highly aggressive and usually associated with poor
prognosis. Unlike other types of breast cancer, TNBC
lacks effective targeted therapies since it lacks estrogen
receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2 [1]. Despite
significant progress in recent years with the development
of potential novel drugs such as PARP inhibitors and
bevacizumab, no targeted therapy are currently available
for use in the metastatic setting [2, 3]. Chemotherapy is the
standard therapy for TNBC patients[4], and neoadjuvant
chemotherapy is often used for treatment of early-stage
TNBC, which reduces tumor stage and increases the
number of patients suitable for breast-conserving surgery
[5]. Although many TNBC patients experience remission,

may provide effective therapies [12, 13]. The Bcl-2 family
of proteins, including anti-apoptosis factors Bcl-xL and
Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic factors Bax, Bik, and Bad, are key
apoptosis regulators [14]. Additionally, survivin is a member
of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) family that inhibits
apoptosis [15]. Both Bcl-2 family proteins and survivin are
overexpressed in many types of human cancers, including
breast cancer [16, 17]. Survivin, in particular, is a promising
candidate for targeted cancer therapy, as its expression is
associated with poor clinical outcome, more aggressive
clinicopathologic features, and resistance to radiation and
chemotherapy [18].
Salicylic acid and salicylate derivative have
been widely used in anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer
therapy [19, 20]. It has been reported that copper (II)
complexes of salicylic acid have similar anti-oxidative
and anti-tumor activities as superoxide dismutase (SOD)
[21]. Specifically, these compounds inhibit the growth
of tumor cells, and Sorenson et al., showed that copper
salicylic acid had anti-tumor potential in animal models.
Treatment led to reduced tumor growth and metastasis,
induced tumor cell differentiation, and increased host
survival [22, 23]. Other studies have found that copper
salicylic acid chelated with phenanthroline increased its
toxicity in tumor cells [24]. Cisplatin-sensitive cell lines,
such as breast cancer cells (MCF-7), prostate cancer cells
(DU-145), and colon cancer cells (HT-29), and cisplatinresistant cell lines, such as ovarian cancer cells (SKOV-3), were all sensitive to low doses of copper salicylate
phenanthroline complexes [21]. Despite these promising
anti-cancer effects of Cu(sal)(phen), its mechanism of
action have not been defined.
In this study, we analyzed the effect of Cu(sal)
(phen) on breast cancer cell growth in vitro and anti-tumor
activity in vivo. We found that Cu(sal)(phen) efficiently
induces apoptosis of TNBC cells through down-regulation
of anti-apoptosis proteins in these cells in vitro and in vivo.
Thus, our results suggest that Cu(sal)(phen) is a promising
novel therapeutic agent for TNBC.

cell growth was almost completely inhibited. In addition,
the effect was more profound in MDA-MB-231 and BT-20
TNBC cell lines compared with MCF-7 and T47D nonTNBC cell lines (Figure 1).

Cu(sal)(phen) induces apoptosis of breast cancer
cells
To determine the involvement of apoptosis in the
Cu(sal)(phen) activity, all breast cancer cell lines MCF-7,
T47D, MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 were treated with
5, 10 and 25 µM of Cu(sal)(phen) for 24 hrs, and then
apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry after Annexin
V/PI double staining. The proportion of apoptotic
cells upon Cu(sal)(phen) treatment increased in a dosedependent manner (Figure 2A). MDA-MB-231 TNBC
cells showed more cells in early apoptosis compared with
MCF-7 non-TNBC cells. Overall, the MDA-MB-231 and
BT-20 TNBC cells were more sensitive to Cu(sal)(phen)
treatment compared to MCF-7 and T47D non-TNBC cells
(Figure  2B). Treatment with 25 µM Cu(sal)(phen) for
24 hrs resulted in more than 80% of TNBC cells (MDAMB-231 and BT-20) undergoing apoptosis, but only 40%
of non-TNBC cells (MCF-7 and T47D). These results
indicated that Cu(sal)(phen) induced potent apoptotic
activity in TNBC cells.

Cu(sal)(phen) induces apoptosis through downregulation of anti-apoptosis proteins in breast
cancer cells
To understand the molecular mechanism by which
Cu(sal)(phen) induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells,
we analyzed the expression levels of several apoptosisrelated proteins after drug treatment of MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cells by Western blot. As shown in Figure 3,
the basal expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin
were much higher in the MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells
than in non-TNBC MCF-7 cells. The expression levels
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL decreased significantly in MDAMB-231 cells after drug treatment (Figure 3A). The
expression level of survivin was also reduced in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 25 µM Cu(sal)
(phen) (Figure 3A). Quantification of the Western blot
results showed that there was a ~80% decrease in survivin
in treated MDA-MB-231 cells compared with a ~43%
decrease in MCF-7 cells (Figure 3B). In addition to the
reduction of Bcl-xL expression in MDA-MB-231 cells,
we also observed a shift of the band, likely corresponding
to a change in phosphorylation state of the protein [25].
Indeed, phosphorylation level of Bcl-xL was dramatically
increased in MDA-MB-231 cells after the treatment
(Figure 3A, 3B). These findings suggest that Cu(sal)
(phen) induces apoptosis through down-regulation of
anti-apoptosis proteins in breast cancer cells, especially
TNBC cells. Moreover, we analyzed the expression of

RESULTS
Cu(sal)(phen) inhibits the growth of breast
cancer cells
To determine the effect of Cu(sal)(phen) on growth
of breast cancer cells, four breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7,
T47D, MDA-MB-231 and BT-20) were treated with
increasing concentrations of Cu(sal)(phen) (5–25 µM),
and cell growth was assessed by MTS assay. As shown in
Figure 1, the growth of all cells was significantly inhibited
by Cu(sal)(phen) treatment compared to the control group
(p < 0.01, Figure 1). There was a dose-dependent effect
of the compound; the extent of inhibition was positively
correlated with increasing Cu(sal)(phen) concentration.

pathways. We found that the expression of cleaved PARP
was increased in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell
lines after Cu(sal)(phen) treatment (Figure 3A, 3B).

animals was not statistically different from the control
animals (Figure 4B). Collectively, these data indicate that,
at the concentration used, Cu(sal)(phen) inhibits tumor
growth and is well tolerated in vivo.

Breast tumor xenografts were generated in nude
mice injected with cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, and then
tumor blocks were seeded for second-generation tumor
formation. Compared with directly injecting cultured
cells, we found that the method of tissue block insertion
has many technological advantages, such as higher tumor
formation rates, faster tumor growth and more uniform
tumor size. Figure 4A shows the tumor growth curves
of the two groups; the tumor volume of drug-treated
group was significantly reduced compared to the control
group at 10 days after drug treatment. Examination of the
histopathology of the tumors revealed obvious necrotic
areas in tumors from the drug-treated group that were not
observed in the control tumors (Figure 4C). Consistent
with the drug being well-tolerated, the weight of treated

We next explored the potential mechanism underlying
the anti-tumor activity of Cu(sal)(phen) in vivo by
examining the expression levels of the apoptotic proteins
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin and proliferation marker Ki-67
by immunohistochemical staining of the tumors and semiquantitative image analysis. The expression levels of Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, survivin and Ki-67 were all reduced in Cu(sal)(phen)treated tumors compared to the tumors from the control mice
(Figure 5A). The average of integrated optical density (IOD)
values of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin and Ki-67 in the Cu(sal)
(phen) treated group was significantly lower than those in the
control group (Figure 5B). These results demonstrated that
Cu(sal)(phen) down-regulates the expression levels of Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, survivin and Ki-67 in tumors.

DISCUSSION

[26], we found that MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells exhibited
much higher level of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL compared to ERpositive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Upon Cu(sal)(phen)
treatment, the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were
dramatically down-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells.
In addition, the level of the phosphorylated Bcl-xL was
significantly increased in MDA-MB-231 cells. Bcl-xL
is phosphorylated at the activation loop on the Ser62 by
JNK, which modulates the Bax/Bcl-xL interactions and
inhibits Bcl-xL’s anti-apoptotic activity [25, 27]. These
data suggest that multiple mechanisms are likely to be
involved in the induction of apoptosis by Cu(sal)(phen).
Survivin primarily inhibits apoptosis through
suppressing activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7,
interfering with caspase-9 activity, and blocking the

It has been shown that Cu(sal)(phen) effectively
inhibits growth of cisplatin-sensitive cell lines, as well
as cisplatin-resistant cancer cell line [21]. However, the
precise molecular mechanism of action has not been
well established. In the current study, we demonstrated
that Cu(sal)(phen) efficiently induced apoptosis of breast
cancer cells, especially TNBC cells. Furthermore, Cu(sal)
(phen) inhibited TNBC tumor growth in a xenograft
model and induced apoptosis through down-regulating
expression of anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and
survivin both in vitro and in vivo.
In contrast to the observation that Bcl-2/Bcl-xL were
primarily expressed in ER-positive breast cancer cells

downstream effectors of apoptosis pathways [28].
Survivin is often overexpressed in breast cancer [29], and
is associated with less apoptosis [30], poor overall survival
[31], and resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [32].
Several therapeutic approaches targeting survivin have
been tested, including inhibition of survivin transcription,
post-translational inhibition of survivin, vaccines against
survivin, and gene therapy approaches such as gene
editing [33]. In this study, we found that the expression

of survivin protein was dramatically reduced by Cu(sal)
(phen) treatment in breast cancer cells, especially in
TNBC cells, suggesting that Cu(sal)(phen) may provide a
promising approach to target survivin expression.
In this study, we also found that Cu(sal)(phen)
treatment attenuated tumor growth in vivo. Similar to
what was observed in vitro, the expression levels of Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL and survivin proteins were down-regulated in
tumor tissue from drug-treated animals as detected by

immunohistochemistry. These findings suggest that
apoptosis induced by Cu(sal)(phen) is likely to be
responsible for its anti-tumor activity. Interestingly, Ki67, a
proliferation marker of tumor [34] and a prognosis marker
for breast cancer, was also down-regulated in tumors in
animals treated with Cu(sal)(phen), suggesting that Cu(sal)
(phen) treatment also suppressed tumor cell proliferation.
Although targeted therapies have long been sought
for TNBC, there has been limited success. Interestingly,
we found that the growth inhibitory activity of Cu(sal)
(phen) was more profound in TNBC cell lines, compared
to ER-positive MCF-7 cells. One of the concerns for
developing Cu(sal)(phen) as a therapeutic agent for TNBC
treatment is toxicity. Although our in vivo experiment
showed that mice well tolerated the dose that effectively
suppressed the tumor growth, additional experiments are
required in order to further develop it into an effective,
less toxic, novel therapeutic agent for human TNBC.

recommendation. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well
culture plates. Following treatment with Cu(sal)(phen) or
DMSO as a control, cell viability was assessed by adding
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) to the culture
medium and incubated for 4 hrs at 37°C. The optical
density was measured at 490 nm using a Synergy 2 plate
reader (Biotek, VT, USA).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was assessed quantitatively using
Annexin V (BD Biosciences) and propidium iodide (PI)
double staining. After treatment, cells were harvested
by trypsinization, stained with Annexin V-FITC, and 50
µg/mL of PI solution, then immediately analyzed by the
Coulter Epics XL Flow Cytometer (Beckman, USA).
Experiments were performed in triplicate, and a total of
10,000 cells were analyzed in each experiment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blotting

Chemicals

Total cell lysate was extracted in the RIPA buffer
containing protease inhibitor cocktail as described
previously [35]. 25 µg of lysate from each cell line
was separated using SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to
Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). Blots were probed
with the following antibodies: anti-Bcl-2 antibody (2870,
Cell Signaling, USA), anti-Bcl-xL (2764, Cell Signaling,
USA), anti-phospho-Bcl-xL (sc-101644, Santa Cruz,
USA), anti-survivin (2808, Cell Signaling, USA) and
anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma, USA) in blocking
buffer (Li-Cor, NB, USA). Then the membranes were
incubated with IRDye secondary antibodies (Licor, NB,
USA). The membranes were scanned and the images were
captured with Odyssey SA (Licor, NB, USA). Images
were analyzed and quantified using ImageStudio software.

Cu(sal)(phen) was synthesized by Dinglong
Chemicals (Wuhan, Hubei, China), with a two-step reaction.
In the first step, 9.7 g of copper hydroxide Cu(OH)2 and
56.2 g of salicylic acid were refluxed in 600 ml pure ethanol
for 8 hrs. Upon cooling to room temperature, a yellowish
precipitate was collected by filtration. The solid product
was further purified by ethanol for three times, and dried in
vacuum at 60oC to generate Cu(sal)2(H2O)2. In the second
step , 3.8 g of the product from the step 1 and 4.3 g of
1,10-phenanthroline were refluxed in 350 ml pure ethanol
for 4 hrs, to generate a greenish mixture. After cooled to
room temperature, the green precipitate was collected by
filtration, and washed by hot ethanol for three times. The
final product Cu(sal)(phen) was dried at 75oC in a vacuum
for 8 hrs. 5mM stock solution was made by dissolving
Cu(sal)(phen) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted
when used. The solvent DMSO was used as mock control.

Xenograft transplantation assays
All animal studies were performed in accordance
with the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research
(NIBR) Animal Care and Use Committee protocols and
regulations approved by Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Wuhan University. Four-week-old
BALB/c-nu female mice were purchased from Hunan SJA
Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd. (Hunan, China), and tumors
were generated by subcutaneous injection of 5 × 106
MDA-MB-231 cells as described previously [36]. When
the diameters of the tumors reached 1 cm, the tumors were
removed and cut into 1-mm3 tumor blocks. The tumor
blocks were seeded for the second-generation tumors. After
implantation in subcutaneous tissue, the mice were divided
randomly into two groups of eight mice each. The tumor
diameter was measured every other day, and tumor volume
was calculated as described previously [37]. When the
diameter of the tumor was greater than 3mm, animals were

Cell lines
MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cell lines
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Rockville, MD, USA). MCF-7 and T47D cells were
cultured in DMEM (Fisher Scientific, Hanover Park, IL).
MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells were maintained in RPMI
1640 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). The media were
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Cell lines under 20 passages were used for all experiments.

Cell growth assays
