BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) therapy for melanoma patients harboring the V600E mutation is initially highly effective, but almost all
patients relapse within a few months. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning BRAFi-based therapy is therefore an
important issue. Here we identiﬁed a previously unsuspected mechanism of BRAFi resistance driven by elevated Hedgehog (Hh)
pathway activation that is observed in a cohort of melanoma patients after vemurafenib treatment. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate
that melanoma cell lines, with acquired in vitro-induced vemurafenib resistance, show increased levels of glioma-associated
oncogene homolog 1 and 2 (GLI1/GLI2) compared with naïve cells. We also observed these ﬁndings in clinical melanoma
specimens. Moreover, the increased expression of the transcription factors GLI1/GLI2 was independent of canonical Hh signaling
and was instead correlated with the noncanonical Hh pathway, involving TGFβ/SMAD (transforming growth factor-β/Sma- and
Mad-related family) signaling. Knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2 restored sensitivity to vemurafenib-resistant cells, an effect associated
with both growth arrest and senescence. Treatment of vemurafenib-resistant cells with the GLI1/GLI2 inhibitor Gant61 led to
decreased invasion of the melanoma cells in a three-dimensional skin reconstruct model and was associated with a decrease in
metalloproteinase (MMP2/MMP9) expression and microphthalmia transcription factor upregulation. Gant61 monotherapy did not
alter the drug sensitivity of naïve cells, but could reverse the resistance of melanoma cells chronically treated with vemurafenib. We
further noted that alternating dosing schedules of Gant61 and vemurafenib prevented the onset of BRAFi resistance, suggesting
that this could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of therapeutic escape. Our results suggest that targeting the
Hh pathway in BRAFi-resistant melanoma may represent a viable therapeutic strategy to restore vemurafenib sensitivity, reducing
or even inhibiting the acquired chemoresistance in melanoma patients.

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma represents the deadliest of all skin cancers (currently
accounting for more than 75% of skin cancer-related deaths).1
About 50% of melanomas harbor activating V600E mutations in
the serine/threonine kinase BRAF, which drives melanoma
initiation and progression through the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway.2 The MAPK pathway is a bona ﬁde
therapeutic target in melanoma with small-molecule BRAF and
MEK inhibitors (BRAFi and MEKi) demonstrating signiﬁcant survival
advantage in patients whose melanomas harbor the BRAF driver
mutation.3–5 Although the results with BRAFi have been very
promising, practically all of the patients treated thus far have
developed resistance.6 Preclinical studies have shown resistance
to be mediated through a diverse array of mediators that lead to
reactivation of MAPK, such as NRAS and MEK mutations, receptor
tyrosine kinase upregulation or elevated COT expression.7 A role
has also been reported for an increase of phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) signaling,8,9 which can arise through

phosphatase and tensin homolog loss10 and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor-α upregulation.11 The identiﬁcation of
MAPK reactivation as a major mediator of resistance led to the
development of BRAFi-MEKi combinations, which are associated
with a longer overall survival than single-agent BRAFi therapy.
Despite the successes of the combination therapy vs BRAF
monotherapy, resistance still occurs.12,13
The development-associated Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway
has been implicated in a variety of malignancies, including
melanoma.14 In canonical Hh signaling, sonic Hh (SHH) inhibits the
suppressor of fused, and activates a complex formed by patched-1
and smoothened (SMO), thus releasing SMO to enable gliomaassociated oncogene homolog (GLI) protein regulation of target
genes.15 GLI1 and GLI2 are transcription factor members of the GliKruppel family and their overexpression is linked to the
development of multiple tumor types.16,17 However, some tumors
express GLI1 and GLI2 in the absence of any activating mutations,
suggesting that Hh signaling can also be activated through
alternative pathways.16 GLI1 and GLI2 activation by noncanonical

Hh pathways already have been described, such as by the PI3K/
AKT pathway,18 and by transforming growth factor-β/Sma- and
Mad-related family (TGFβ/SMAD) pathway.19 TGFβ/SMAD noncanonical Hh signaling is a potential driver in melanoma16 and
GLI2/TGF-β cooperate to repress microphthalmia transcription
factor (MITF) expression.20 In the current study, we demonstrate a
role for TGFβ/SMAD-driven noncanonical Hh signaling in vemurafenib resistance in melanoma patient samples and in vitro
models of acquired BRAFi resistance.
RESULTS
GLI1 and GLI2 expression is increased in vemurafenib-resistant
melanoma cell lines in vitro
To examine the potential role of GLI1/GLI2 in BRAFi-resistant
melanoma, we initially characterized their expression in normal
skin cells and melanoma cell lines. In normal keratinocytes and
ﬁbroblasts, basal GLI1/GLI2 mRNA expression was higher compared with that in all melanoma cell lines examined, whereas
normal melanocytes had GLI1/GLI2 mRNA expression levels equal
to or lower than melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Figures S1A
and B). GLI1 mRNA and protein expression were higher in almost
all naïve primary melanoma cells (WM35, WM278, WM793 and
WM1552c) compared with metastatic lines (WM9, WM1617,
1205Lu, UACC62, SK-MEL-19, SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-29). This
proﬁle was also found for GLI2 expression, but to a lesser extent
(Supplementary Figure S1C).
We next generated isogenic pairs of vemurafenib-sensitive and
-resistant cell lines (Supplementary Figure S2A). Acquired vemurafenib resistance was validated by the ability of the cells to
maintain their MEK and ERK phosphorylation levels in the
presence of the drug and by the observed shift in the inhibitory
concentration 50% in the resistant cell lines (IC50; Supplementary
Figure S2B), and as observed in our previous study.21 It was noted
that GLI1 mRNA expression was elevated in 8/9 (89%) and GLI2

mRNA expression was elevated in 4/9 (44%) of vemurafenibresistant melanoma cell lines in comparison with the naïve
counterpart (Figures 1a and b, respectively). These data were
further conﬁrmed at the protein level (Figure 1c). Taken together,
these data demonstrated that vemurafenib-resistant melanoma
cells showed increased expression of GLI1 and GLI2 compared
with drug-naïve cell lines (Figures 1d and e, respectively).
Increased expression of GLI1 and GLI2 is observed in melanoma
patients failing BRAFi therapy
We next determined the clinical relevance of the increased
GLI1/GLI2 expression seen upon acquisition of BRAFi resistance.
Eleven melanoma tissue samples were analyzed (six samples
pre-vemurafenib treatment and ﬁve samples post-vemurafenib
treatment), from two different patients. The resistance proﬁles
were conﬁrmed by clinical progression of the lesions on
vemurafenib treatment. These specimens were conﬁrmed by
two independent pathologists (Supplementary Table S1). The sites
of melanoma were identiﬁed in both patients, by 1–6 (pretreatment) and by 1-5R (postrelapse) (R1–R5; Figure 2a).
GLI1/GLI2 immunostaining was performed in all melanoma
samples (Figure 2b), in regions previously selected by hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) and morphological analysis. Before vemurafenib
treatment, 0/6 (0%) and 1/6 (17%) of patients’ samples were
positive for GLI1 and GLI2 expression, respectively. Following the
acquisition of vemurafenib resistance, 5/5 (100%) and 2/5 (40%) of
samples were positive for GLI1 and GLI2 expression, respectively
(Figure 2c).
Noncanonical Hh pathway is involved in acquisition of
vemurafenib resistance
GLI1 and GLI2 are members of both the canonical and
noncanonical Hh pathways. As the expression of SMO, suppressor

did not increase following the acquisition of vemurafenib
resistance, we focused upon the noncanonical members of the
Hh pathway. Expression of soluble TGFβ1 and its membrane
receptor TGFβRII were signiﬁcantly upregulated in both cell lines
with BRAFi resistance, and in the UACC62 vemurafenib-resistant
cell line, the membrane receptor TGFβRI mRNA was also increased
in comparison with the naïve counterpart (Figure 3b). Moreover,
SMAD3 expression was increased in both vemurafenib-resistant
cell lines, and SMAD2 mRNA expression increased in the UACC62
vemurafenib-resistant cell line (Figure 3c). SMAD4 mRNA expression was not altered in either of the cell lines. The increased
expression of components of the TGFβ/SMAD pathway was
conﬁrmed at the protein level (Figures 3d and e). Moreover,
addition of TGF-β1 led to increases in GLI1 and GLI2 mRNA
expression, with more robust increases occurring in the
vemurafenib-resistant SK-MEL-28 cell line (Figure 3f). A link
between the TGF-β pathway and noncanonical GLI1/GLI2 signaling was suggested by the observation that SIS3 (an SMAD3
inhibitor) treatment led to a signiﬁcant inhibition of GLI1 and GLI2
expression in both SK-MEL-28 and UACC62 vemurafenib-resistant
melanoma cell lines (Figure 3g).
Knockdown of GLI1/GLI2 leads to both senescence and increased
drug sensitivity
To determine the role of GLI1/GLI2 expression in the resistance
phenotype, we performed lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA

(shRNA) knockdown in the SK-MEL-28 cell line (which
expressed high levels of GLI1 and GLI2). First, we used a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and observed 75% and
91% of mRNA and protein inhibition for shGLI1 and
shGLI2, respectively (Figures 4a–c). These knockdowns were
extremely efﬁcient, but were also associated with induction
of senescence (Figure 4d) as determined by staining for
senescence-associated
β-galactosidase.
We
therefore
performed gene silencing with an MOI of 5 and found
25% and 55% of mRNA and protein inhibition for shGLI1
and shGLI2, respectively (Figures 4e–g). Although the efﬁciency of gene silencing was less, an MOI of 5 was used in
the subsequent assays to evaluate the role of GLI proteins
in vemurafenib resistance. After gene silencing, cells were
treated for 72 h with vemurafenib, with GLI1 knockdown
having a small but signiﬁcant increase in vemurafenib sensitivity (IC50 of 26.1μM compared with 29.6 μM in shControl cells).
Furthermore, GLI2 knockdown caused an even greater
increase in drug sensitivity (IC50 of 15.6μM compared with
29.6 μM in shControl cells), which may be explained by
GLI2 knockdown reducing GLI1 and GLI2 expression
(Figure 4h). Moreover, GLI1 and GLI2 knockdown led to
a decrease in MMP2/9 mRNA expression in SK-MEL-28-resistant
cells (29% and 16% for shGLI1–20 and 51% for shGLI2,
respectively) (Figure 4i).

Gant61 induces antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in
vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells
We then sought to verify that GLI1/GLI2 expression in
vemurafenib-resistant cells was regulated through the noncanonical Hh pathway. We treated the SK-MEL-28- and UACC62-naïve
and -resistant melanoma cell lines with either cyclopamine
(inhibitor of SMO) or Gant61 (inhibitor of GLI1/GLI2). Although
cyclopamine did not alter cell viability in naïve or resistant lines
(Figure 5a), Gant61 led to a 20% decrease in viability in naïve cells
and a 60% decrease of viability in resistant cells (Figure 5b).
We evaluated the colony-forming ability of vemurafenibresistant SK-MEL-28, UACC62 and R3 cells (extracted from patient
no. 1) after long-term treatment with TGFβ1, Gant61 and
cyclopamine at different concentrations (Figure 5c). TGFβ1 was
Oncogene (2017) 1849 – 1861

associated with signiﬁcantly more colonies in vemurafenibresistant SK-MEL-28 cells (SK-MEL-28R). All resistant cells treated
with Gant61 showed signiﬁcantly decreased colony area and
fewer total colonies at both 1 and 10 μM of the drug, showing the
dose-dependent effect. Cyclopamine treatment was associated
with a decrease in colony area in only vemurafenib-resistant
UACC62 cells (UACC62R) and a slight decrease in the total number
of colonies in all the cell lines at the highest concentration tested
(Figures 5d and e). A role for GLI1/GLI2 in the TGF-β1-mediated
process of therapeutic escape was suggested by the ability of
Gant61 to inhibit the increase in colony formation seen following
TGF-β1 treatment (Supplementary Figures S3A and B).
TGFβ1 treatment was also associated with a slight, nonsigniﬁcant, decrease in cell viability after 48 h of treatment (up to 12%),

whereas Gant61 induced a substantial decrease (up to 80%) and
cyclopamine induced a moderate decrease in cell viability (up to
26%; Figure 5f). Another noncanonical Hh inhibitor, SIS3 (SMAD3
inhibitor), also demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in cell viability
(up to 64%; Figure 5f), but was also associated with high
cytotoxicity to normal skin keratinocytes (Supplementary
Figure S4A). This elevated cytotoxicity was related to its high
basal SMAD3 mRNA expression (Supplementary Figure S4B).
Further investigations into the mechanisms of cell death revealed
that Gant61 treatment induced apoptosis in the resistant
melanoma cells (Figure 5g) and decreased the Bcl2/Bax ratio
(data not shown). Cell death was strongly associated with direct
GLI1/GLI2 downregulation, as well as MITF upregulation in the
resistant melanoma cells (Figure 5h). To determine the

relationship between the GLI proteins and MITF expression
in vivo, we next examined their expression in The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) melanoma cohort (Supplementary Figure S5A). These
data showed a clear inverse correlation between GLI2/MITF, with
MITF expression being markedly reduced in melanomas expressing high levels of GLI2. The relationship with GLI1 was
less obvious, indicating that GLI2, rather than GLI1, has a major
role in repressing MITF expression in human melanoma specimens. This analysis revealed a positive correlation between GLI1/
GLI2/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and AXL, and that
this was negatively correlated with MITF expression. The expression of EGFR showed an 18-fold (Supplementary Figure S5B)
increase in the resistant SK-MEL-28 cell line relative to its naïve
counterpart, with MITF expression being decreased more than

3-fold (Supplementary Figure S5C). Pharmacological inhibition of
GLI1/2 following Gant61 treatment was associated with decreased
EGFR expression and increased MITF expression in these
resistant cells.

Consistent with our observation that GLI mediated invasiveness,
we further observed altered expression of EMT markers following
Gant61 treatment, with studies showing an upregulation of CDH1
(E-cadherin) and a downregulation of CDH2 (N-cadherin)

(Figure 5i). These changes were even observed in the cells that
had previously received TGF-β1 treatment (Supplementary
Figure S3C). Taken together, these data suggested a link between
GLI signaling and the adoption of an EMT-like phenotype,
downstream of TGF-β. Multiple invasion markers, such as matrix
metalloproteinases 2/9 (MMP2/MMP9), were also downregulated
after Gant61 treatment in three different resistant cell lines
(Figure 5j).
Invasive potential decrease after Gant61 treatment in 3D
reconstructed melanoma skin model
Because Gant61 treatment inhibited MMPs expression in vitro, we
next investigated this phenomenon in a more physiologically
relevant three-dimensional (3D) organotypic skin culture model.
These studies showed that untreated naïve melanoma cells
were highly invasive and crossed the basement membrane into
the dermal compartment in reconstructed human skins
(RHS) (Figures 6a and b). Treatment with Gant61 led to an increase
in the dispersal of the naïve cells (Figures 6c and d) with no
apparent tumor foci seen. Non-treated resistant cells (Figures 6e
and f) showed more melanoma cell foci than Gant61-treated
resistant cells (Figures 6g and h). It is worth noting that the
MMP2/MMP9 expression was elevated in untreated naïve cells
(Figures 6i and j) and repressed after Gant61 treatment (Figures 6k
and l). This same increase in MMP2/MMP9 expression was
also found in resistant melanoma cells (Figures 6m and n).
On the other hand, Gant61 treatment also inhibited MMP2/MMP9
protein expression in resistant RHS (Figures 6o and p).
Moreover, reduction in melanoma growth was also
conﬁrmed by the decrease in thickness seen after Gant61
treatment in both RHS with naïve and resistant melanoma
cells (Figure 6q).
In RHS seeded with drug-naïve melanoma cells, there was a
nonsigniﬁcant decrease in MMP2/MMP9 expression after Gant61
treatment (5–10%); however, robust MMP2/MMP9 mRNA downregulation (65% and 41%, respectively) was found when using
resistant melanoma cells in comparison with the non-treated
controls (Figures 6r and s). Furthermore, the decrease in
melanoma invasion inhibition is correlated with lower GLI1/GLI2
downregulation after Gant61 treatment (Figures 6t and u) and
increased MITF expression (Figure 6v). These results show that
GLI1/GLI2 inhibition by Gant61 treatment induces apoptosis, in
addition to decreasing survival and invasion markers.
Vemurafenib resistance can be modulated and delayed with
alternating Gant61 treatment
We next determined whether vemurafenib resistance could be
abrogated or delayed through the use of vemurafenib and/or
Gant61 under a variety of dosing schedules (Figure 7a). In all cases,
the reversal of vemurafenib resistance was determined by the shift
in the IC50 values to the drug (Figure 7b).

It was found that coadministration of Gant61 and vemurafenib
in naïve cell lines prevented the increase in vemurafenib IC50
values typically seen after chronic drug treatment.
It was noted that Gant61 treatment alone did not alter
sensitivity to vemurafenib when compared with untreated naïve
cells. The concomitant treatment with vemurafenib/Gant61 or
only vemurafenib dosed on alternate days conferred resistance to
vemurafenib in a manner equivalent to continuous vemurafenib
monotherapy. Alternate dosing of vemurafenib and Gant61
induced less resistance and was associated with a lower IC50
value. The delay in resistance was likely to be a result of GLI1 and
GLI2 downregulation in the group receiving alternating vemurafenib and Gant61 treatment (Figures 7c and d). No change in
GLI1 or GLI2 expression was seen in the continuous or alternating
vemurafenib treatment groups. Overall, these ﬁndings demonstrate that vemurafenib resistance can be modulated or delayed
by alternating treatment with BRAFi and GLI inhibitor.
DISCUSSION
Hh signaling promotes survival, a selective growth advantage
to tumor cells16 and has been implicated in multidrug
resistance.22,23 Although some groups have suggested that Hh
signaling may be involved in drug resistance, such as that
mediated through platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α
upregulation,11 the role of this pathway in vemurafenib resistance
remains unexplored. We found that GLI1/GLI2 expression
increased upon the acquisition of BRAFi resistance. These results
were found in both cultured cell lines and in clinical melanoma
samples. These ﬁndings may be mediated through MAPK pathway
reactivation in the resistant cells, which can directly result in
increased GLI transcriptional activity to support motility, invasion
and tumorigenesis.15
In addition to GLI1/GLI2 expression, we found upregulation of
other members of the noncanonical Hh pathway, including TGFβ1,
TGFβRII and SMAD3 in the resistant cells. The activation of the
noncanonical Hh pathway by TGFβ increases GLI1/GLI2 expression, in part, because GLI1 is a direct transcriptional target of
GLI2.24 GLI2 activation potentiates GLI1 expression and promotes
the invasion and metastatic processes.25 Accordingly,
vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines with increased GLI2
expression also showed elevated GLI1 expression. Furthermore,
other factors that are known to promote Hh pathway activation
were also found in the melanoma cells,15,26 that is, EGFR
ampliﬁcation in SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells, loss of phosphatase
and tensin homolog in UACC62 melanoma cells and p53
mutations in both melanoma cell lines.27 Taken together, this
provides consistent evidence that the Hh pathway is activated in
vemurafenib-resistant cells.
There is already some suggestion that GLI signaling may be
involved in melanoma initiation, possibly by mediating the escape
from cellular senescence.26 Our ﬁndings demonstrated that drugresistant SK-MEL-28 cells exhibited an increase in senescenceassociated β-galactosidase staining after effective GLI1 and GLI2

gene silencing. After partial GLI2 knockdown, resistant cells
presented increased sensibility to vemurafenib, with a twofold
reduction in vemurafenib IC50. The Hh pathway has previously
been implicated in resistance to other chemotherapeutics, such as
cisplatin and taxanes in ovarian cancer.28,29 Moreover, GLI2
knockdown increases paclitaxel chemosensitivity in prostate
tumor cells.30 Besides increasing vemurafenib sensitivity, both
GLI1 and GLI2 knockdown decreased MMP2 and MMP9 gene
expression in vemurafenib-resistant cells; however, shGLI1 was
more effective in abrogating MMP2 than shGLI2. Some papers
described the role of GLI1 and MMPs contributing to a more

invasive behavior,31,32 showing that modulating GLI1 expression
can directly affect MMP activation. Furthermore, modulation of
GLI1 expression may be linked to many noncanonical Hh
pathways, thus inhibition of GLI1 could decrease some growth
factors such as TGF-β, as well as decreasing GLI2 expression.33
Vemurafenib-resistant cells treated with cyclopamine did not
show altered cell viability or any changes in the total number of
colonies at low concentrations. These ﬁndings were expected as
cyclopamine is a classical Hh canonical SMO inhibitor,34 whereas
in vemurafenib resistance appeared more dependent on the
noncanonical Hh pathway. Regardless of these ﬁndings,

cyclopamine is not an ideal choice for clinical development as it is
both teratogenic and unable to reverse the adoption of an EMTlike phenotype.35
Elevated TGFβ expression is known to be a poor prognostic
factor in melanoma and is associated with tumor progression.36
Moreover, TGFβ and MMP2/9 release are potent regulators of the
‘vicious cycle’ in tumor microenvironment that results in cell
invasion and metastasis.37 It is already known that vemurafenib
treatment induces TGFβ release from melanoma cells38 and this
release can induce expression of EGFR, which contributes to BRAFi
and MEKi resistance.39–41 TGFβ signaling can also mediate
resistance by activation of the MAPK pathway and by inhibition
of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in response to a variety of
cancer drugs.42,43 As expected, in cells with noncanonical Hh
pathway activation, TGFβ1 treatment signiﬁcantly increased
colony number, indicating an elevated tumorigenic potential.44
Gant61 decreases both GLI gene/protein expression45 and can
induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and modulation of cell
migration/EMT by decreasing MMP2/9 levels.46 In this study,
Gant61 treatment induced a decrease in cell viability, colony area
and total number of colonies in resistant melanoma cells (as
previously described in other cancer cells).25 The clonogenic assay
evaluates the capacity of each cell to drive cell division to
determine the effectiveness of cytotoxic agents and the capacity
to produce individual colonies.47 The decrease in colony area and
colony number after Gant61 treatment was dose-dependent with
the cell lines demonstrating some variation in their sensitivity to
this agent, as shown with cyclopamine and TGF-β1 treatments.
Moreover, Gant61 treatment repressed colony formation and
modulated EMT by switch of cadherins expression in vemurafenibresistant cells treated with TGF-β1. The link between EMT and GLI
regulation has been established previously48 and TGF-β is known
to induce this phenotypic switch,49 showing the cross-talk and
downstream effects of GLI modulation by TGFβ in the context
of EMT.
Gant61 also increased MITF expression in vemurafenib-resistant
melanoma cells, and reversed the invasive proﬁle50 that was
previously reported to be induced by MAPKi therapy in
melanoma.51 The inverse correlation found between low GLI
and high MITF expression was identiﬁed previously in melanoma
samples,52,53 and may be linked to the adoption of less aggressive
behavior.52,54–58 We further examined the TCGA melanoma cohort
to determine the relationship between GLI protein expression and
the invasion signatures described by Hoek et al.57 or Verfaillie
et al.58 In TCGA melanoma samples, we found a signature proﬁle
between GLI2-high/MITF-low. This analysis also showed a strong
correlation between GLI1/GLI2/EGFR/AXL. The identiﬁcation of a
resistant EGFR/AXL signature may allow patients with intrinsic

resistance to BRAFi56 to be identiﬁed prospectively. Additionally,
the MITF-low/AXL-high levels are often correlated with drug
resistance phenotype in melanoma54 and can be resistant to RAFi
and MEKi, singly or in combination.55
In RHS, GLI1/GLI2 were downregulated and MITF was upregulated after Gant61 treatment, which is in accordance with the
monolayer assays. The in vitro RHS model constitutes both dermal
and epidermal layers, and hence it is appropriate to study the
invasive potential of skin cancers, allowing assessment of growth
and progression of melanoma cells; additionally, this model
permits the evaluation of synthesis and release of soluble factors,
such as MMPs.59,60 Gant61 induced a signiﬁcant decrease of MMP
expression in both two-dimensional and 3D models, indicating the
loss of invasive potential and, consequently, an inhibition of tumor
dissemination. All these observations provide evidence that the
RHS can be effectively used in the evaluation of stromal cell
migration/invasion and, ultimately, in the screening of antitumor
drugs.60–64
Our ﬁndings also demonstrated that GLI1/GLI2 modulation
could be a useful strategy to prevent drug resistance, at least in
part. Alternating pre-treatment with vemurafenib and Gant61
signiﬁcantly reduced IC50 values of subsequent vemurafenib
treatment in naïve melanoma cells and could represent a
promising approach to prevent the onset of vemurafenib
resistance. It should be noted, however, that Gant61 did not
completely reverse the resistant phenotype, again illustrating the
complexity of drug resistance in melanoma and highlighting the
redundancy between multiple signaling pathways. The modulation of vemurafenib chemosensitivity resulting from suppression
of GLI1/GLI2 expression did not occur under treatment protocols
involving continuous or alternating monotherapy with vemurafenib. It was, however, noted that alternating vemurafenib and
Gant61 treatment could suppress GLI expression, delaying or
decreasing vemurafenib resistance. The continuous treatment
with vemurafenib induced a resistance proﬁle even in combination with others inhibitors, for example, BRAFi+MEKi,65 BRAFi+
ERKi66 and BRAFi+PI3K/mTORi67 because of resistance mechanisms mainly caused by tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, a
discontinuous dosing strategy can modulate the drug-resistant
proﬁle of these cells, which may contribute to extend the
vemurafenib response in melanoma patients with BRAF
mutations.68,69
An important feature of anticancer agents is the ability to
induce cell death (usually apoptosis).70 Here we found that GLI
downregulation induced apoptosis and this event may have
contributed to the increased sensitivity of melanoma cells to
vemurafenib. Hh signaling is already implicated in chemotherapeutic resistance in multiple cancers, such as in gastric cancer

stem cells and basal cell carcinoma.71,72 Therefore, some studies
also describe in vitro the potential of Gant61 in increasing the
sensitivity of chemotherapeutic agents such as vincristineresistant leukemia cells,73 and rapamycin in myeloid leukemia
cells.74 Gant61 has also been shown to increase the chemosensitivity in CD34+-enriched acute myeloid leukemia progenitor
cells.75
Gant61 is one of the most efﬁcient inhibitors of GLI-DNA
binding45 with the potential to target cell viability, proliferation,
apoptosis, DNA damage repair and EMT. Many animal studies
have shown a decrease in tumor growth and an increase in
apoptosis after Gant61 treatment in different tumors such as
prostate, neuroblastoma and lung.45,76,77 Furthermore, our data
suggest that Gant61 could be a useful tool to overcome or delay
resistance after single-agent treatment. Studies have already
reported the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of Gant61,46 indicating
Oncogene (2017) 1849 – 1861

its future translational potential. In this context, the durability of
vemurafenib antitumoral response may be improved through
modiﬁcations in the dosing schedule.68
It is possible that a relationship of synthetic lethal drug
combination exists between GLI and BRAFi, leading to MAPK
reactivation in vemurafenib-resistant tumors. Taken together, our
data demonstrated an unprecedented mechanism of vemurafenib
resistance by GLI1/GLI2 upregulation, shedding light on the
development of Hh pathway inhibitors as a promising strategy for
melanoma treatment.

shGLI2 or shControl, respectively) with two or three different hairpin
sequences (Supplementary Table S4) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The cells were incubated with polybrene at 5 μg/ml for 12 h at
37°C, then the lentiviral particles were added (MOI = 10 or 5) in the culture
medium and selection with puromycin was performed (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The shControl was performed as a negative control
(scrambled shRNA sequence). The shRNAs generated were validated for
gene and protein by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively.

Melanoma cell line cultures
Melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-19, SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-29, UACC62, WM9,
WM35, WM278, WM793, WM1552c, WM1617 and 1205Lu were kindly
provided by Dr Marisol Soengas (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones
Oncological, Madrid, Spain) and Dr Enilza Maria Espreáﬁco (Ribeirão Preto
Medical School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil). The identities of
the cell lines were conﬁrmed through STR validation analysis.21 The R3
melanoma cell line was obtained from patient no. 1 after acquisition of
vemurafenib resistance proved by tumor recurrence.
Melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-19, SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-29, UACC62 and R3
were cultured in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Melanoma cell lines WM9, WM35,
WM278, WM793, WM1552c, WM1617 and 1205Lu were cultured in
MCDB153/Leibovitz's L-15 (4:1) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum,
insulin 5 μg/ml and CaCl2 1.6 mM.78 All melanoma cells were maintained in
a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C containing 5% of CO2.

Cell culture and generation of BRAFi resistance
To derive vemurafenib-resistant cell lines, naïve cells were seeded at low
cell density and treated with vemurafenib at 0.5–6 μM every 3 days for 4–
6 weeks, and thus colonies were then isolated.8,21 SK-MEL-19-, WM278-,
WM793-, WM1552c-, WM1617- and 1205Lu-resistant cells were derived by
successive titration of vemurafenib up to 3 μM and SK-MEL-28-, SK-MEL-29and UACC62-resistant cells up to 6μM. Resistant cell lines were replenished
with 3 or 6μM vemurafenib every 2–3 days.

Primary skin cell cultures
Normal human skin cells were obtained from donated foreskin samples
from the University of São Paulo Hospital (HU-USP:943/09; CEP/FCF/
USP:534). Cells were isolated and cultivated as described previously by our
group.60,79 Fibroblasts and melanocytes were maintained in a humidiﬁed
incubator at 37 °C containing 5% of CO2, whereas keratinocytes at 7.5%
CO2.

Patient samples
Melanoma samples of patients from the Barretos Cancer Hospital (Barretos,
Brazil) pre- and post-vemurafenib treatment were obtained after signing of
patients in the informed consent form. Melanoma samples were analyzed
and conﬁrmed by two different pathologists. This study was approved by
the Ethics in Research Committee of the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences
of the University of São Paulo (849.540/2014) and the Barretos Cancer
Hospital Ethic Committee (890/2014).

Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA were isolated using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA). TaqMan Gene Expression Assays primer/probes were used
(Supplementary Table S2). The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase/β-actin data were used for normalizing interest genes. Quantitative
reverse transcriptase–PCR reactions were carried out as described
previously.10

Western blotting
Proteins were extracted and blotted for as described previously.80 Total
and phosphoproteins were analyzed (Supplementary Table S3). After
analysis, western blots were stripped once and reprobed for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase/β-actin/vinculin to show even protein
loading.

RNA interference
The SK-MEL-28 vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell line was plated
(2.5 × 104 cells per well) to the transfection with lentiviral particles by
shRNA technique for GLI1 or GLI2 genes or a negative control (shGLI1,

Cell viability assay (MTT assay)
Cells were plated in triplicate wells (1 × 104 cells per well) and treated with
increasing concentrations of vemurafenib (0–48 μM) or drug diluent
(dimethyl sulfoxide) for 24/48/72 h. Cell viability was determined using
MTT assay as described previously.81

Senescence β-galactosidase
Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of ~ 2.5 × 104 cells per well
after shRNA. Then, the cells were ﬁxed and stained using a senescence βgalactosidase cytochemical detection.82 Plates were incubated overnight
at 37 °C and the cells were detected for blue staining under a bright ﬁeld.83

Colony formation
Cells (1 × 104/ml) were grown overnight before being treated with TGFβ1,
cyclopamine or Gant61 for 4 weeks as described previously.84 Relative
colony area density was determined by the ImageJ 1.49n software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA) with ColonyArea plugin and colony number was
determined by the Molecular imaging software Bruker 7.1.1.20220v
(Bruker BioSpin Corp., Billerica, MA, USA).

Flow cytometry
Cells were plated into 6-well tissue culture plates at 60% conﬂuency and
left to grow overnight before being treated with Gant61 for 48 h. Annexin
V and propidium iodide staining were carried out as described
previously.84

TCGA transcriptomic analysis
See Supplementary Materials and methods.

Reconstructed skin in vitro (RHS)
RHS were prepared in two steps. First, the dermal compartment was
prepared using type-1 collagen gel and 1.5 × 104 human ﬁbroblasts/
dermis. After polymerization, 25 × 104 human keratinocytes, 0.83 × 104
human melanocytes and 8.3 × 104 melanoma cells (SK-MEL-28-naïve or
vemurafenib-resistant) were seeded on top of each lattice and the skins
were kept submerged in the culture medium for 24 h. Subsequently, the
culture was raised and maintained at the air–liquid interface for 12 days to
allow complete keratinocytes stratiﬁcation and differentiation.64,79 The RHS
containing resistant cells were treated with vemurafenib every 72 h and
the RHS containing naïve or resistant cells were treated with Gant61 in the
last 72 h of culture period.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry
The samples were ﬁxed, followed by dehydration, cleaning for parafﬁn
inclusion and stained with H&E for morphological analysis and with
different antibodies to immunochemistry assays (Supplementary Table S5).
All images were obtained by optical microscopy and analyzed by the NISElements software (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA). Measurement of
melanoma area thickness was carried out using three images with ﬁve
independent measurements of the melanoma areas thickness from three
different experimental conditions.79

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± s.d of triplicate of three independent
experiments. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and
signiﬁcant mean differences were determined using multiple comparisons
by the Tukey–Kramer test at the Po0.05 level. Signiﬁcant differences
between the control and treated groups are indicated by ***Po 0.001,
**Po0.01 and *P o0.05.
