BACKGROUND: Rolapitant, a novel neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, provided effective protection against chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting (CINV) in a randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial of patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy
or an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide regimen. The current analysis explored the efficacy and safety of rolapitant in preventing
CINV in a subgroup of patients receiving carboplatin. METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral rolapitant (180 mg) or a
placebo 1 to 2 hours before chemotherapy administration; all patients received oral granisetron (2 mg) on days 1 to 3 and oral dexamethasone (20 mg) on day 1. A post hoc analysis examined the subgroup of patients receiving carboplatin in cycle 1. The efficacy
endpoints were as follows: complete response (CR), no emesis, no nausea, no significant nausea, complete protection, time to first
emesis or use of rescue medication, and no impact on daily life. RESULTS: In the subgroup administered carboplatin-based chemotherapy (n 5 401), a significantly higher proportion of patients in the rolapitant group versus the control group achieved a CR in the
overall phase (0-120 hours; 80.2% vs 64.6%; P < .001) and in the delayed phase (>24-120 hours; 82.3% vs 65.6%; P < .001) after chemotherapy administration. Superior responses were also observed by the measures of no emesis, no nausea, and complete protection
in the overall and delayed phases and by the time to first emesis or use of rescue medication. The incidence of treatment-emergent
adverse events was similar for the rolapitant and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Rolapitant provided superior CINV protection to
patients receiving carboplatin-based chemotherapy in comparison with the control. These results support rolapitant use as part of

INTRODUCTION
Progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) has led to
therapeutic advances and improved antiemetic prophylaxis strategies.1,2 For patients with cancer who receive highly
emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5HT3) receptor antagonists (RAs) have demonstrated efficacy in CINV control during the acute phase (24 hours). However, the utility of 5-HT3 RAs with or without dexamethasone for controlling CINV in the delayed phase (>24-120
hours) is limited.1,3
Antiemetic guidelines recommend the addition of a neurokinin-1 (NK-1) RA for patients receiving HEC on the
strength of well-controlled trials demonstrating the benefit of these agents in CINV prevention.4-6 Guidelines currently
recommend that a 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone be used in all patients receiving MEC and that patients with additional
CINV risk factors also receive an NK-1 RA.4,5

Rolapitant for Carboplatin-Induced CINV/Hesketh et al

The MEC category includes chemotherapeutic
agents with an emetic potential ranging from 30% to
90%.4,6 Carboplatin, a second-generation platinum analog, has an emetic potential greater than that of many
agents classified as MEC.4,7 According to a natural history
study, without antiemetic prophylaxis, 89% of
carboplatin-treated patients experienced some degree of
nausea, and 82% of patients vomited.7 Carboplatin is also
associated with a risk of delayed emesis.8,9 In an assessment of carboplatin-induced emesis patterns, a greater
proportion of patients experienced vomiting in the
delayed phase versus the acute phase after carboplatin
administration despite ondansetron treatment (37% experienced delayed vomiting, whereas 22% experienced acute
vomiting); delayed nausea was reported by 82% of
patients.8 Another study found that despite prophylaxis
with a 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone, more than a third
of patients with cancer treated with carboplatin experienced moderate-to-severe delayed CINV.9 Because of the
emetic risk associated with carboplatin, there is a need to
improve CINV protection in patients administered
carboplatin-based chemotherapy.
Rolapitant (VARUBIV; TESARO, Inc, Waltham,
Mass) is a highly selective, long-acting NK-1 RA that was
recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in combination with other antiemetic agents
in adults for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including, but not limited to,
HEC.10 Rolapitant does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme; therefore, dose
adjustments of dexamethasone and certain other concomitantly administered medications metabolized by
CYP34A are not required.10,11
Recently updated National Comprehensive Cancer
Network antiemetic guidelines support the use of rolapitant (category 1 level of evidence and consensus) to protect against CINV in both patients with cancer receiving
HEC and select patients receiving MEC.4 The inclusion
of rolapitant in the antiemetic guidelines was based on
the results of 3 large, global, randomized, double-blind,
controlled phase 3 studies demonstrating that oral rolapitant combined with a 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone
was superior to a 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone alone in
providing CINV protection in the delayed phase to
patients receiving HEC or MEC.12,13 The MEC trial
was designed before antiemetic guidelines reclassified
anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC)â€“based regimens as HEC; therefore, the MEC trial included ACbased chemotherapy in the analysis along with other

MEC regimens as prespecified in the study protocol.12
In all, 52.8% of the patients received AC-based chemotherapy in the MEC trial, and 30.1% received
carboplatin-based chemotherapy; the remaining patients
received a broad range of other MEC agents. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate whether the addition
of rolapitant provided protection against CINV in the
large subgroup of patients who received carboplatinbased chemotherapy in the phase 3 MEC trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients

A global, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, controlled phase 3 study (NCT01500226) was
conducted in 23 countries in North America, Central and
South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.12 The protocol
was approved by institutional review boards at each study
site, all patients provided written informed consent, and
all investigators and site personnel were required to follow
ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki
and consistent with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and applicable local laws and regulations.
To be eligible for the phase 3 study, male and female
patients were required to be 18 years old or older, naive to
MEC or HEC, and scheduled to receive their first course
of 1 or more of the following agents alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics: intravenous cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m2), doxorubicin, epirubicin,
carboplatin, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, daunorubicin, and intravenous cytarabine (>1 g/m2). The study
protocol prespecified that at least 50% of the patients enrolled in the study would receive AC-based therapy.
Patients were required to have a Karnofsky performance score  60%, a predicted life expectancy  4
months, and adequate bone marrow, kidney, and liver
function. Before the study treatment, patients were not
permitted to use any of the following medications: 5-HT3
RAs, phenothiazines, benzamides, domperidone, cannabinoids, NK-1 RAs, or benzodiazepines within 48 hours;
palonosetron within 7 days; or systemic corticosteroids or
sedative antihistamines (eg, dimenhydrinate or diphenhydramine) within 72 hours of day 1 with the exception
of premedication for chemotherapy (eg, taxanes).
Treatment

A central, interactive, Web-based system was used to randomly assign patients in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by sex, to
the rolapitant or control treatment group, as shown in
Figure 1. Blinding was maintained throughout the study

vomiting score, and total score by summing the responses
within each subdomain individually and in combination.
No impact on daily life was defined as an average item
score > 6 on the 7-point scale (>108 for the total score).15
Efficacy for the measure of CR in the overall phase was
also evaluated by sex and age.
Safety variables included treatment-emergent
adverse events (TEAEs), physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory results.
Statistical Analysis
Figure 1. Treatment schema. Patients received a single oral
dose of rolapitant (180 mg) or matching placebo capsules 1
to 2 hours before the administration of chemotherapy on day

was also administered once daily on days 2 and 3. Patients
who were administered taxanes received dexamethasone

(cycles 1-6). After cycle 1, patients were allowed to continue the same treatment regimen in a blinded fashion for
up to 5 additional cycles.
Efficacy and Safety Assessments

During the first 120 hours (5 days) after the administration of chemotherapy, patients recorded all events of vomiting and use of rescue medication in a daily diary.
Patients also self-assessed nausea daily with a 100-mm
horizontal visual analog scale (VAS; Supporting Fig. 1
[see online supporting information]).
The subgroup of patients who received carboplatinbased chemotherapy were evaluated for the following efficacy endpoints for cycle 1: complete response (CR; defined
as no emesis and no use of rescue medication) in the overall
phase (0-120 hours), CR in the acute phase (24 hours),
and CR in the delayed phase (>24-120 hours). Other efficacy endpoints examined in all phases were no emesis, no
significant nausea (maximum VAS score < 25 mm), no
nausea (maximum VAS score < 5 mm), and complete protection (no emesis, no rescue medication, and maximum
VAS score < 25 mm). The time to first emesis or use of
rescue medication and no impact on daily life were also
evaluated. The assessment of no impact on daily life was
examined with the Functional Living Indexâ€“Emesis (FLIE)
questionnaire, a validated measure of the impact of CINV
symptoms on daily life.14,15 Patients completed the FLIE
questionnaire on day 6 during cycle 1. Responses for each
of 9 questions on nausea and 9 questions on vomiting were
marked on a 7-point VAS. We calculated the nausea score,
2420

Patients in the modified intent-to-treat population (ie,
patients who received at least 1 dose of the study drug of
the phase 3 MEC trial and were enrolled at a Good Clinical Practiceâ€“compliant site) who received carboplatinbased chemotherapy were included in the post hoc analysis of efficacy. The results are presented for cycle 1 of
chemotherapy.
Between-group comparisons of efficacy endpoints
were conducted with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel v2
test. The time to first emesis or use of rescue medication
was summarized with Kaplan-Meier methodology, and
the between-group treatment comparison was conducted
with a log-rank test. Subgroup analyses were not prospectively powered and thus may have lacked the power to
demonstrate statistical significance. P values < .05 were
considered to be statistically significant and were not
adjusted for multiplicity.
The safety population consisted of all randomized
patients in the carboplatin subgroup who received at least
1 dose of the study drug.
RESULTS
Patients

Of the 1332 patients who composed the modified intentto-treat population for the phase 3 MEC trial, 401
received their first course of chemotherapy with a
carboplatin-based regimen and were included in the efficacy analysis for cycle 1. Baseline and disease characteristics were similar for patients in the rolapitant and control
groups, as shown in Table 1. The median age of the
patients was 62 years, and more patients were female
(54.9%) than male (45.1%). The primary malignancy
among patients treated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy was lung cancer (52.1%); other malignancies
included ovarian, breast, and uterine cancer (13.7%,
13.7%, and 7.7%, respectively). The receipt of concomitant emetogenic chemotherapy with a Hesketh level  3
was low and occurred in 15.7% of the patients.

Efficacy

Among patients who received carboplatin-based chemotherapy, a significantly higher proportion of patients in
the rolapitant group versus the control group achieved a
CR in the overall phase (80.2% vs 64.6%; P < .001) and
in the delayed phase (82.3% vs 65.6%; P < .001; Fig. 2).
In the acute phase, very few patients experienced CINV,
regardless of treatment, and no significant difference in
the CR rate was observed between the groups (91.7% vs
88.0%; P 5 .231; Fig. 2).
Significantly higher response rates were achieved in
the rolapitant group versus the control group by the measures of no emesis, no nausea, and complete protection in
the overall phase and in the delayed phase (Table 2). A
higher proportion of patients in the rolapitant group versus the control group experienced no significant nausea in
the overall and delayed phases, although the differences
did not reach statistical significance (Table 2). The effect
of rolapitant was numerically greater than the control for
most other assessed endpoints; however, these differences
did not reach statistical significance (Table 2).
Across the 120-hour study period, the time to first
emesis or use of rescue medication was significantly
improved in the rolapitant group versus the control group
(P < .001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the separation of the curves was greatest in the delayed phase (Fig.
3), and this was consistent with the CR rates for the overall study population. The separation of the curves became
pronounced after 48 hours and was sustained through
120 hours.
Cancer

According to the FLIE patient-reported outcome
tool, a higher proportion of patients in the rolapitant
group versus the control group reported no impact on
daily life (FLIE total score > 108), but the difference did
not reach statistical significance (86.1% vs 80.4%; P 5
.145).
An evaluation of patient factors associated with
CINV risk (sex and age1,2) was also examined for the measure of CR in the overall phase for the rolapitant and control groups. Consistent with the overall carboplatin
subgroup analysis, responses favoring rolapitant over the
control were maintained in the sex and age subgroups.
Significantly higher percentages of male and female
patients in the rolapitant group in comparison with sexmatched patients in the control group achieved a CR (Table 3). In addition, a greater proportion of patients in the
rolapitant group versus the control group achieved a CR
in each of the age subgroups examined (Table 3). The
patient numbers in these subgroups were small; statistical
significance was reached with rolapitant versus the control
for patients aged 45 to <65 years, the age subgroup that
contained the largest number of patients.
Safety and Tolerability

The safety data set for patients administered carboplatinbased chemotherapy comprised 404 patients: 194
received rolapitant, and 210 received the control. The
overall incidence of TEAEs in cycle 1 was similar between
the rolapitant and control groups (Table 4). The frequencies of individual TEAEs were generally comparable
between the rolapitant and control groups. No patients

with a standard 2-drug regimen using a 5-HT3 RA and
dexamethasone. The CR rate was significantly higher

criteria set forth by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and the European Society for
Medical Oncology, a >10% absolute benefit is sufficiently clinically meaningful to warrant a change in guidelines.6 The absolute benefit observed with rolapitant in

consistent clinically meaningful benefit of approximately
10% to 14% with the addition of an NK-1 RA for
patients receiving carboplatin-based chemotherapy has
begun to emerge in the literature.2,16,17 In a recent
double-blind, randomized phase 3 study of patients
receiving nonâ€“AC-based MEC, 53% of whom received
carboplatin-based chemotherapy, the addition of fosaprepitant to a 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone regimen provided absolute benefits of 10.4% and 10.2% for a CR in
the delayed phase and the overall phase, respectively.18
The addition of aprepitant to standard antiemetic regimens yielded absolute benefits of 14% for the measure of
no emesis in the overall phase16,19 and for the CR rate in
the overall phase20 in carboplatin-treated patients. Smaller
studies have produced inconsistent results for the benefit
of aprepitant in patients administered carboplatin therapy.21-23 Data on netupitant also suggest a similar benefit
based on measures of no emesis and CR in the overall
phase with historical controls used for comparison.17,24
Given the consistency of recently available evidence,
including the clinically meaningful benefit observed with
rolapitant in this large carboplatin-treated subgroup from
a recently completed phase 3 study, guideline committees
may consider recommending an NK-1 RA as part of a triple regimen with a 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone for
patients with cancer receiving carboplatin-based
chemotherapy.
The impact of the established patient risk factors of
sex and age1,2,17 was also examined in this carboplatin
subgroup. Regardless of sex or age subgroup, rolapitant
provided better CINV protection than the control. More
patients attained a CR with rolapitant than the control in
all subgroups examined, although statistical significance
Cancer

August 1, 2016

was not reached in all of the age subgroups. Patient numbers were too small to be conclusive; however, results were
generally consistent with those of the overall carboplatin
subgroup analysis.
Rolapitant was well tolerated in the carboplatin subgroup, and this was consistent with the safety profile
reported in phase 3 studies.12,13 The incidence of adverse
events with rolapitant was comparable to the incidence
with the control, and these adverse events were generally
considered to be related to chemotherapy or the underlying disease.
In addition, rolapitant, a long-acting NK-1 RA, may
help to simplify the medical management of patients with
cancer undergoing emetogenic chemotherapy. Rolapitant,
which does not inhibit or induce CYP3A4,10 reduces the
potential for CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions
and eliminates the need for dose modifications of certain
drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 such as dexamethasone.
The results of this large carboplatin subgroup post
hoc analysis demonstrate that oral rolapitant (180 mg),
combined with a 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone, resulted
in superior CINV prevention in comparison with a 5HT3 RA and dexamethasone alone, despite some limitations (ie, no adjustment for multiplicity, not prospectively
powered, and numerical but not significant differences in
FLIE scores > 108). These data support the use of rolapitant as part of the antiemetic prophylaxis regimen for
patients with cancer undergoing carboplatin-based
chemotherapy.
