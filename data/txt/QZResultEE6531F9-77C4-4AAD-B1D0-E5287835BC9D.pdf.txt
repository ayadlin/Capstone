ABSTRACT:
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of
tumor of the central nervous system. Despite significant efforts to improve treatments,
patient survival rarely exceeds 18 months largely due to the highly chemoresistant
nature of these tumors. Importantly, misregulation of the apoptotic machinery plays
a key role in the development of drug resistance. We previously demonstrated that
Bcl-xL, an important anti-apoptotic protein, is regulated at the level of translation
by the tumor suppressor programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). We report here a strong
correlation between low expression of PDCD4 and high expression of Bcl-xL in adult
de novo GBM, GBM tumor initiating cells, and established GBM cell lines. Importantly,
high Bcl-xL expression correlated significantly with poor progression and patient
survival. We demonstrate that re-expression of PDCD4 in GBM cells down-regulated
Bcl-xL expression and decreased cell viability. Finally, we show that direct inhibition
of Bcl-xL by small molecule antagonist ABT-737 sensitizes GBM cells to doxorubicin.
Our results identify Bcl-xL as a novel marker of GBM chemoresistance and advocate
for the combined use of Bcl-xL antagonists and existing chemotherapeutics as a
treatment option for this aggressive tumor.

INTRODUCTION

latter tumors show molecular and genetic changes that are
different from de novo GBMs, including frequent mutation
of p53 and mutation of IDH1[1, 2].
Low expression levels of the tumor suppressor
programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) have been correlated
with poor outcome in patients with GBM. The frequent
loss of PDCD4 in GBM is partly due to epigenetic
silencing secondary to 5’CpG island methylation [3]
as well as over-expression of microRNA 21 (miR21) which targets PDCD4 mRNA for degradation [4].
Furthermore, frequent over-activation of kinases, in
particular S6K1 and S6K2, observed in GBM leads to
phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of PDCD4
[5-7]. PDCD4 plays key roles in a number of cellular

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most
common primary intrinsic tumor of the central nervous
system in adults and one of the most aggressive types
of cancer [1, 2]. Despite significant efforts to improve
the outcome of patients with GBM, their median
survival remains approximately 18 months, with a fiveyear survival of 5%. Both extensive infiltration of the
adjacent brain that prevents radical surgical removal, and
resistance to chemotherapy are the key factors of poor
outcome. About 90% of GBM occurs de novo, while the
remaining 10% result from the progression of a lower
grade astrocytoma. Defined as secondary GBMs, these

processes including cell growth and invasion via inhibition
of the AP-1 transcription factor as well as translation
suppression through the eukaryotic initiation factor
(eIF) 4A (reviewed in [8]). Since eIF4A is thought to be
required for translation of virtually all cellular mRNAs,
the PDCD4-dependent inhibition of eIF4A results in
a decrease in global translation. Recently, however,
several reports identified specific targets of PDCD4,
thus pointing towards a novel role for this molecule in
regulating selective translation of distinct mRNAs and
not as a general inhibitor of translation [6, 9, 10]. Among
the specific PDCD4 targets we identified the Bcl-2 family
member Bcl-xL. Bcl-xL is an inhibitor of mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization thus is a strong antiapoptotic protein [6]. In addition it plays a role in p53
signaling [11] and cell cycle progression and checkpoints
[12]. We demonstrated that PDCD4 specifically binds to
and represses translation from the internal ribosome entry
site (IRES) of Bcl-xL and that loss of PDCD4 removes the
repression on the Bcl-xL IRES and results in an increase in
Bcl-xL protein levels [6].
Given the known roles of Bcl-xL in regulation of
apoptosis and chemoresistance, we sought to determine if
the loss of PDCD4 expression observed in GBM causes
elevated Bcl-xL expression, which could explain the high
chemoresistance of GBM cells. Indeed, we find that low
levels of PDCD4 correlate with high levels of Bcl-xL
in both de novo GBM patient tumors and in established
GBM cell lines and that high Bcl-xL correlates with
poor progression and patient survival. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that re-expression of PDCD4 in GBM
cells results in a repression of Bcl-xL protein expression
and a decrease in cell viability. Finally, we demonstrate
that direct inhibition of Bcl-xL by the small molecule
inhibitor ABT-737 results in a sensitization of GBM
cells to doxorubicin. Our data identify Bcl-xL as a
target of PDCD4 whose elevated levels contribute to
high chemoresistance in GBM, thus providing a novel
treatment option for this aggressive tumor.

GBM.
In order to study the relationship between BclxL and PDCD4 expression in a clinical setting, we
investigated with immunohistochemistry a cohort of 50
human de novo GBMs. Twenty-six GBMs were positive
for Bcl-xL, where 15 of them showed expression in more
than 50% of neoplastic cells (score 2) (Figure 1A, 1B)
and 11 showed focal expression (score 1). Thirty cases did
not show any detectable PDCD4. Interestingly, 18 cases
with no PDCD4 showed Bcl-xL positive cells and 12
PDCD4 positive cases had no Bcl-xL. Immunopositivity
for Bcl-xL was cytoplasmic and granular in keeping
with its mitochondrial localization (Figure 1A). Bcl-xL
immunolabelling was also found in reactive astrocytes,
a few microglial cells and some neurons. Sixteen tumors
showed PDCD4 nuclear and/or cytoplasmic expression but
it was only limited to a minority of tumor cells (score 1).
In all 50 lesions, PDCD4 was present in endothelial and
inflammatory cells, including perinecrotic macrophages
(Figure 1A). Six out of the seven recurrent cases
demonstrated diffuse Bcl-xL expression that was more
intense than in the primary tumor. No change in PDCD4
was seen in recurrent tumors compared to the primary
lesion. Chi square test for trend (p=0.0469) of this cohort
suggested that PDCD4 likely regulates Bcl-xL protein in
human samples, therefore confirming our previous in vitro
data. The distribution of Bcl-xL and PDCD4 positive cases
is represented in Figure 1B.
To understand if Bcl-xL and PDCD4 have
any impact on patient outcomes, we correlated their
expression with progression and survival (Figure 1C,
1D). Patients with Bcl-xL positive GBM (score 1 and 2)
showed a median progression of 136 days and median
survival of 280 days against median progression of 284.5
days and survival of 611 days of patients with Bcl-xL
negative lesions. Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test showed
a significant difference between the Bcl-xL positive and
Bcl-xL negative cases for both progression (p=0.0187)
and survival (p=0.0476). The effect on MGMT status
did not correlate with either progression or survival
suggesting that Bcl-xL represents an important biomarker
of chemoresistance of GBM.
In order to further explore the link between PDCD4
and Bcl-xL we examined a panel of established GBM cells
lines and patient-derived tumor initiating cells (TICs).
We measured the relative ratio of Bcl-xL and PDCD4
using HEK293 cells as a reference. In concordance with
patient samples, we find that GBM cells exhibit low levels
of PDCD4, which correlate with a robust expression of
the Bcl-xL protein (Figure 2A, 2C). We have previously
described the mechanism by which PDCD4 regulates
expression of Bcl-xL through translational repression of
the Bcl-xL IRES [6]. In accordance with this, other than
U343 cells, we find that the levels of Bcl-xL mRNA do
not differ significantly between HEK293 and GBM cells
(Figure 2B), lending further support to the notion that

RESULTS
Loss of PDCD4 correlates with increased Bcl-xL
in human GBM samples.
Our previous work demonstrated the role of PDCD4
in regulating Bcl-xL, an inhibitor of apoptosis, through
its IRES-mediated translation. Under normal proliferative
conditions, we demonstrated that PDCD4 specifically and
directly binds to and inhibits Bcl-xL IRES translation.
However, when expression of PDCD4 is down-regulated,
the repression on Bcl-xL is relieved thus resulting in an
increase in Bcl-xL protein levels. These findings prompted
us to investigate the link between PDCD4 and Bcl-xL in

PDCD4 is an inhibitor of Bcl-xL translation and that the
loss of PDCD4 in GBM results in de-repression of Bcl-xL
translation.
To further demonstrate the causal link between
PDCD4 and Bcl-xL expression, U373 cells were
transiently transfected with GFP- or PDCD4-expressing
plasmids and the expression of Bcl-xL was determined
by Western blot analysis. We find that restoring the
expression of PDCD4 resulted in a significant decrease
in Bcl-xL (Figure 3A). Furthermore, since Bcl-xL is a
known inhibitor of apoptosis, we were interested in
determining the effect that the PDCD4-mediated decrease

in Bcl-xL expression would have on cell viability. We thus
measured cell viability in GFP- or PDCD4-transfected
cells by Alamar blue analysis. We observed that restoring
PDCD4 levels in U373 cells resulted in a significant
reduction in cell viability (Figure 3B). Taken together,
this data suggests that the apoptotic resistance typically
observed in GBM cells is due in part by the large increase
in the expression of Bcl-xL, which is a result of the loss
of PDCD4. More importantly, our data suggest that by
manipulating the levels of Bcl-xL, GBM cells could be
sensitized to chemotherapeutics.

In contrast, one cell line, U87, was sensitive to ABT-737
at high concentrations. Similarly, with the exception of

Since re-introduction of PDCD4 protein into tumor
cells is likely not a feasible therapeutic option, we sought
to explore if targeting downstream of PDCD4 would
offer an effective strategy. We therefore chose to inhibit
Bcl-xL using the small molecule inhibitor ABT-737 in
combination with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin.
We expected that inhibition of Bcl-xL would sensitize
cells to doxorubicin since high Bcl-xL levels would no
longer inhibit the apoptotic machinery. Four different
GBM cell lines (U87, U373, SNB19, SNB75) were treated
with ABT-737 alone or in combination with doxorubicin
for 24 hours and cell viability was determined (Figure 4).

we observed a significant correlation between Bcl-xL
and tumor progression and patient survival. This data
suggests that Bcl-xL may be a good prognostic tool to
identify patient outcome and response to chemotherapy,
independent of MGMT status. Our results differ from the
study published by Cartron et al [16] where the authors
examined 13 members of the Bcl-2 family, including BclxL, and found no correlation with overall survival. Their
analysis was based on Western blot and Elisa data and
the results were evaluated semi-quantitatively attributing
score 0 to tumors with low expression and 1 to tumors
showing high expression. Given the heterogeneity of the
microenvironment of GBMs that contains several nonneoplastic cell populations [17], we decided to assess
Bcl-xL by immunoperoxidase immunohistochemisty on
tissue sections. This allowed us to count the expression in
tumor cells only. With this approach entrapped neurons,
microglia and reactive astrocytes that were seen to
express the protein were excluded from our assessment.
In contrast, expression of Bcl-xL in non-neoplastic cells
may have affected Cartron et al. results that were obtained
using tumor homogenates. Given the retrospective nature
of our study, semi-quantitative analysis of Bcl-xL was
based on number of positive cells rather than intensity
of expression accounting for another difference between
the two studies. Correlation with outcome was obtained
considering positive cases with those with more than 5%
of expression irrespective of intensity. With a similar
semi-quantitative approach Yoshimine et al [18] observed
a correlation between lower survival and increased
expression of Bcl-xL in urothelial carcinoma, further
suggesting a role for this molecule in cancer progression.
Furthermore, we also observed this correlation
in tumor initiating cells and in a panel of established
GBM cell lines, which we utilized for further analysis.
Importantly, we did not see a significant change in Bcl-xL
mRNA levels that would account for the drastic increase
in protein levels. This finding suggests that transcription
and/or stability of the mRNA is not a contributing factor;
however, translation of the Bcl-xL mRNA is critical
for the increase in protein. This further supports our
previous findings that PDCD4 can negatively regulate
Bcl-xL IRES mediated translation. To verify that PDCD4
directly affects Bcl-xL in GBM cells, we rescued PDCD4
expression, which resulted in reduction in Bcl-xL levels
and importantly, a reduction in cell viability. In order to
use this therapeutically to our advantage, we decided to
target downstream of PDCD4 since overexpressing a
protein in patient tumor samples is likely not a feasible
option. We treated four different GBM cell lines with the
chemotherapeutic doxorubicin, which resulted in minimal
cell death at low concentrations likely due to the high
levels of Bcl-xL. Increase in cell death was observed
at high concentrations of the drug in accordance with
previous reports [19]. Importantly, by directly inhibiting
Bcl-xL with the chemical inhibitor ABT-737, we were able

DISCUSSION
Despite the recent advances in surgical resection
techniques, radiotherapy planning and dose delivery, and
stratified targeted medical treatment, more than 90% of
patients with GBM succumb to disease within 18 months
from onset and show an overall median progression-free
survival time of approximately 7 months [2]. Recent
clinical trials have achieved better outcomes with
median overall survival of up to 22 months but such an
improvement is likely influenced by better supportive care,
more aggressive salvage therapy and a more stringent
selection of patients enrolled. In fact, good preoperative
and postoperative performance status and extensive
neurosurgical tumor resection are important factors
influencing the outcome. Extensive infiltration of normal
brain, intra and inter-tumoral molecular and genetic
heterogeneity, and chemoresistance of neoplastic cells are
the key determinants of poor treatment response.
Chemotherapy represents the mainstream treatment
modality in GBM but glioma cells characteristically
show simultaneous resistance towards cytotoxic drugs.
Such multidrug resistance can occur at the beginning
of treatment or be acquired during chemotherapy. The
mechanisms causing chemoresistance are complex and
multifactorial [13]. In addition, defects in the apoptotic
pathway are also important in tumor drug resistance,
which can be secondary to either over-activation of antiapoptotic proteins or to the loss of expression or loss of
function of pro-apoptotic molecules [14]. In our previous
studies, we demonstrated that the tumor suppressor protein
PDCD4 plays a critical role in regulating IRES mediated
translation of key anti-apoptotic factors including Bcl-xL
[6]. We showed that under normal conditions, PDCD4
directly binds to and inhibits translation of Bcl-xL
mRNA. However, upon loss of PDCD4, the repression is
relieved thus resulting in IRES mediated translation and
an increase in protein production. High levels of Bcl-xL
have been associated with chemoresistance by inhibiting
the cell from undergoing apoptosis upon the addition
of stressors [15]. This chemoresistance is through BclxL’s ability to prevent mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization and cytochrome c release. Since PDCD4
is a known tumor suppressor, and is lost in a variety of
tumors including GBM, we were interested in determining
if this loss also corresponds with an increase in Bcl-xL,
which would contribute to the highly chemoresistant
nature of GBM tumors. Indeed, we identified a correlation
between low levels of PDCD4 and high levels of Bcl-xL
in a cohort of 50 primary GBM tumors. Furthermore,

of doxorubicin. These data clearly indicate the importance
of monitoring the levels of Bcl-xL in patient tumors as

for immunohistochemical stains. Five micron sections
were cut from each block for immunohistochemistry. All
lesions were routinely assessed for MGMT gene promoter
methylation and expression of the mutant IDH1R132H.
Peroxidase immunohistochemitry was performed on
FFPE tissue sections with antibodies directed against
PDCD4 (Rabbit polyclonal, Rockland at the dilution of
1:350 following antigen retrieval 20 in steamer in citrate
buffer at pH 6) and anti-Bcl-xL (Rabbit polyclonal Cell
Signalling at the dilution of 1:200, following antigen
retrieval 20 in steamer in citrate buffer at pH 6). Briefly,
sections were dewaxed in xylene and dehydrated in
decreasing alcohols to distilled water. Endogenous
peroxidase quenching was obtained by incubating
the sections in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min.
Immunostains were then performed with an automated
immunostainer (Leica bond III, Leica Microsystems Ltd,
Milton Keynes, UK). Sections were counterstained in
Harris’ hematoxylin, dehydrated in progressive alcohols
and xylene and coverslipped. Sections of pharyngeal
tonsils were used as a positive control for PDCD4 and
sections of colon cancer were used as positive control
for Bcl-xL. Immunostains following similar protocol but
with omission of the primary antibody were performed
as negative controls. The extent of expression of the
two proteins was assessed semi-quantitatively on tissue
sections. Expression between 0-5% was considered
negative (score 0), while tumors featuring more than
50% of positive cells were scored 2. Any tumor showing
between 5 and 50% positivity was scored 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection:
From the Brain Tumor Registry at Imperial College,
London UK, we have selected 50 adult patients operated
de novo GBM whom the clinical history, pre-operative
and post-operative MRI scan, and data on post-operative
radio-chemotherapy and follow-up were available for
review (Supplementary Table) and examined their
tumors for the expression of PDCD4 and Bcl-xL. Given
the heterogeneous nature of GBM, we chose samples
obtained from maximally safe surgical debulking rather
than stereotactic biopsies because they allowed us to
examine as much tumor tissue as possible and investigate
the full extent and distribution of the two proteins. We
chose supratentorial, hemispheric GBMs because gross
total excision is not achievable in tumors occurring in
the subcortical grey matter, cerebellum, brainstem and
spinal cord. None of the patients had previous evidence of
a lower grade astrocytoma. In order to correlate PDCD4
and Bcl-xL expression with patients’ outcome, we
selected patients that had Karnofsky’s performance status
at onset of 70 or higher. Evidence of disease progression
documented at follow-up neuroimaging and survival time
were used as measures of outcome and were calculated in
days from the day of operation.
Of the 50 patients, 19 were female; the mean age
at the time was 57 years and 2 months (range between
31yrs 5mo– 78yrs 7mo; median 58yrs). Progression time
ranged between 23-1154 days (average 316 days; median
207 days). Survival ranged 30-1611 days – average 492
days; median 355 days). Five patients were alive at the
time of the last follow-up and four of them were clinically
stable with no evidence of progression at neuroimaging.
Ten patients had a second operation following progression
after chemoradiation but diagnostic tissue for further
immunostains was only available in 7 cases. Two of these
10 patients had progression after the second operation.
All patients had consented for their tissue to be used for
research.

Cell Culture:
Human embryonic kidney (HEK293), and human
glioblastoma (SNB19, SNB75, U87, SF295, U343, SF268,
U373) cells were maintained in standard conditions in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine,
and 1% antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin).
Cells were transfected using Fugene (Roche) as per the
manufacturer’s protocol. For the isolation of tumor
initiating cells, consent was obtained from patients in
accordance with a protocol approved by the Ottawa
Hospital Research Ethics Board. Surgical samples were
digested with Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON,
Canada), filtered through 100 µM and 40 µM nylon mesh
filters, and plated on laminin-coated plates in Neurobasal

Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada), EGF and FGF
(Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) as described by Pollard
et al [20]. Cells were cultured in 5% O2/CO2 at 37°C.

were characterized for chromosomal abnormalities typical
