Abstract
Therapeutic subunit vaccines based on tumor-associated antigens (TAA) represent an attractive approach for
the treatment of cancer. However, poor immunogenicity of TAAs requires potent adjuvants for therapeutic
efficacy. We recently proposed the tumor necrosis factor family costimulatory ligands as potential adjuvants for
therapeutic vaccines and, hence, generated a soluble form of 4-1BBL chimeric with streptavidin (SA-4-1BBL) that
has pleiotropic effects on cells of innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity. We herein tested whether these
effects can translate into effective cancer immunotherapy when SA-4-1BBL was also used as a vehicle to deliver
TAAs in vivo to dendritic cells (DCs) constitutively expressing the 4-1BB receptor. SA-4-1BBL was internalized by
DCs upon receptor binding and immunization with biotinylated antigens conjugated to SA-4-1BBL resulted in
increased antigen uptake and cross-presentation by DCs, leading to the generation of effective T-cell immune
responses. Conjugate vaccines containing human papillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein or survivin as a self-TAA had
potent therapeutic efficacy against TC-1 cervical and 3LL lung carcinoma tumors, respectively. Therapeutic efficacy of the vaccines was associated with increased CD4+ T and CD8+ T-cell effector and memory responses and
higher intratumoral CD8+ T effector/CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T regulatory cell ratio. Thus, potent pleiotropic immune
functions of SA-4-1BBL combined with its ability to serve as a vehicle to increase the delivery of antigens to DCs
in vivo endow this molecule with the potential to serve as an effective immunomodulatory component of therapeutic vaccines against cancer and chronic infections. Cancer Res; 70(10); 3945–54. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Subunit vaccines based on tumor-associated antigens
(TAA) hold great promise as therapeutic cancer vaccines because of their safety profile as well as potential efficacy in
preventing recurrences due to the establishment of longterm immunologic memory. However, the therapeutic potential of cancer vaccines remains to be realized despite many
advances in vaccinology. The weak immunogenicity of TAAs,
potential tolerance to self-TAAs, and various immune evasion mechanisms used by progressing tumors are obvious culprits for the inefficacy of therapeutic cancer vaccines (1, 2).

Therefore, vaccine strategies that target both the innate and
adaptive immune systems for the generation/upregulation of
potent antitumor immune responses and simultaneously
overcome tumor immune evasion mechanisms are more likely
to succeed in the clinic. In this context, the development/
discovery of adjuvants that not only have pleiotropic effects
on a broad range of immune cells but also can be used as a
vehicle to deliver antigens to dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo
will be an important step forward for improving the therapeutic efficacy of cancer vaccines.
DCs play key roles in orchestrating innate, adaptive, and
regulatory immune responses (3), and as such have been targeted for the development of therapeutic vaccines. Although
effective in inducing immune responses, vaccination with
DCs that have been manipulated ex vivo by various means
to present TAAs achieved clinical responses in only a few patients (4). In addition, DC-based cellular vaccines are time
and labor intensive, costly, and most importantly are patient
customized, which severely limit their broad clinical application. Therefore, intense efforts have been devoted to manipulate DCs in vivo for the improvement of therapeutic efficacy
of TAA-based conventional vaccines (4). Accumulated knowledge suggest that TAA-based vaccine formulations that target DCs in vivo may benefit from potent adjuvants with dual
functions: as an antigen delivery vehicle and modulator of DC
activation, antigen uptake, and cross-presentation. Adjuvants

that also directly enhance the function of immune effector
cells, such as T cells and natural killer cells, as well as overcome various tumor-mediated immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells,
will have added advantages.
We recently hypothesized that the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) family costimulatory ligands may serve as important immunomodulators for the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines (5–7) because of their critical roles in immune responses
(8). We particularly focused on 4-1BBL as signaling through its
receptor, 4-1BB, has pleiotropic effects on cells of innate (9, 10),
adaptive (11, 12), and regulatory immunity (13). A subset of DCs
constitutively expresses 4-1BB (9, 10) and triggering of 4-1BB on
these cells has been shown to increase their survival (14), secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-12 (9, 10), and improved ability
to stimulate T cells (9). In addition, 4-1BBL has been reported to
be the most potent costimulatory member of the TNF family in
stimulating human T cells (15), resulting in clonal expansion,
survival, and the establishment and maintenance of long-term
immune memory (8, 11). Importantly, 4-1BB signaling endows
T effector (Teff) cells resistant to Treg cell suppression (7, 13, 16)
and has been shown to reverse T-cell anergy (17).
Inasmuch as the natural 4-1BBL functions as a cell
membrane–bound protein and has no activity in soluble form
(18), we recently generated a novel form of this ligand (SA-41BBL) by fusing the extracellular domain of murine 4-1BBL
to the COOH terminus of a modified core streptavidin (SA;
ref. 16). This molecule served as a safe and more effective
immunomodulatory component of therapeutic cancer vaccines than toll-like receptor agonists CpG, lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), and its derivative monophosphoryl lipid A as well as
an agonistic antibody (Ab) to 4-1BB receptor (6, 7). The immune
efficacy of SA-4-1BBL was associated with its pleiotropic effects
on cells of innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity (7). In addition, the SA portion of SA-4-1BBL allows for rapid conjugation
with biotinylated TAAs, taking advantage of the unsurpassed
noncovalent interaction between SA and biotin (19). Because
DCs constitutively express 4-1BB (9, 10), we hypothesized that
SA-4-1BBL can serve as a vehicle to deliver biotinylated antigens
to DCs in vivo for improved antigen uptake, cross-presentation,
and initiation of effective immune responses.
We herein showed that SA-4-1BBL is internalized by DCs
upon receptor binding and conjugating antigens to SA-4-1BBL
significantly improved vaccine efficacy in vivo through increased DC antigen uptake, cross-presentation, and activation, leading to robust T-cell proliferation and effector
functions. A single vaccination with SA-4-1BBL conjugated
to human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 (viral TAA) or survivin
(bona fide self-TAA) resulted in increased therapeutic efficacy
over nonconjugate vaccine formulations for the eradication
of established primary and metastatic TC-1 cervical and
3LL lung carcinoma tumors, respectively. Importantly, vaccine efficacy was associated with enhanced CD4+ T and CD8+
T-cell effector and memory responses and increased intratumoral CD8+ Teff/Treg cell ratio. The pleiotropic immune effects
of SA-4-1BBL combined with its ability to deliver TAAs to DCs
in vivo presents a novel vaccine approach with implications for
the treatment of cancer and chronic infections.

Materials and Methods
Mice. C57BL/6.SJL, C57BL/6, OT-I/rag−/−, and OT-II/ra−/−
mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, Taconic,
or bred in our barrier animal facility at the University of
Louisville. C57BL/6 4-1BB −/− mice were kindly provided
by Dr. A.T. Vella (University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT)
with permission from Dr. B.S. Kwon (University of Ulsan, Ulsan,
Korea). All animals were cared for in accordance with institutional and NIH guidelines.
Reagents. The construction, expression, and purification
of SA-4-1BBL and core SA have previously been described
(16), except that SA-4-1BBL was modified to include a linker
between SA and 4-1BBL to improve protein expression. These
proteins had undetectable endotoxin levels. Fluorochromeconjugated Abs to various immune cell surface markers or
cytokines and isotype controls were purchased from BD Bioscience, eBioscience, and BioLegend. Chicken ovalbumin
(Ova) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and, after biotinylation, was tested for endotoxin (Ova-bio, 0.045 EU/μg protein). Detailed information of the cloning, expression, and
purification of HPV16 E7 (0.021 EU/μg protein) and mouse
survivin (0.066 EU/μg protein) can be found in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
SA-4-1BBL internalization assay. DCs were derived from
wild-type or 4-1BB−/− bone marrow cells (7). Cells (1 × 106)
were incubated with 10 μg/mL FITC-labeled SA-4-1BBL protein at 4°C for 1 hour, washed, and incubated in complete
MLR medium either kept at 4°C or incubated at 37°C for
1 hour. Cells were then washed, plated on coverslips, fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, blocked FcγR with a monoclonal Ab (mAb) against this receptor (clone, 2.4G2; BD Pharmingen) in 1% bovine serum albumin, and stained for CD11c.
Confocal microscopy was used to assess the binding and internalization of SA-4-1BBL-FITC.
Flow cytometry. Phenotyping and T-cell sorting were
performed as recently described (6). Intracellular cytokine
staining was performed on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate–
stimulated (5 ng/mL) and ionomycin–stimulated (500 ng/mL)
cells as reported (20).
Conjugation of biotinylated proteins to SA-4-1BBL. Ova
was biotinylated using the ChromaLink Biotin Protein Labeling kit (Solulink), whereas E7 and survivin were biotinylated
using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotinylation kit (Pierce) following the manufacturers' protocols. SA-4-1BBL or SA was
conjugated to biotinylated antigens at various ratios on ice
for 45 minutes before testing in various assays.
In vivo antigen targeting, uptake, and cross-presentation
by DCs. C57BL/6 mice were immunized s.c. with FITC-labeled
Ova (10 μg) alone, conjugated SA-4-1BBL-Ova-FITC (25–10 μg),
or nonconjugated SA-4-1BBL+Ova-FITC (25 + 10 μg). Draining
lymph nodes were harvested 24 hours later and processed into
a single-cell suspension. After blocking Fc receptors, cells were
stained with CD11c-PE, CD11b-PerCP-Cy5.5, B220-PE-cy7, and
CD8-APC-cy7 Abs and uptake of Ova-FITC by DCs was analyzed using flow cytometry. Antigen cross-presentation was
studied under similar conditions, except Ova without FITC
was used for immunization. The presence of H-2Kb/SIINFEKL

complexes was detected on the surface of DCs by flow cytometry with antigen-presenting cell–conjugated 25D1.16 Ab.
In vivo cytotoxicity. For Ova or E7-specific in vivo killing
assays, naïve C57BL/6 (CD45.2+) mice were immunized s.c.
with either Ova (50 μg), conjugated SA-4-1BBL-Ova (25–50 μg),
or nonconjugated SA-4-1BBL+Ova (25 + 50 μg), or E7 (10 μg),
conjugated SA-4-1BBL-E7 (25–10 μg), or nonconjugated SA4-1BBL+E7 (25 + 10 μg). One week later, mice received carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)–labeled target
cells (CD45.1+) pulsed with SIINFEKL or E749-57 peptide, respectively, as previously described (7).
In vivo OT-I and OT-II proliferation assays. To test if the
conjugate vaccine first targets DCs for immune efficacy, C57BL/
6.SJL (CD45.1+) mice were immunized s.c. with Ova either conjugated or mixed with various doses of SA-4-1BBL. After 24 or
48 hours, flow-sorted OT-I CD8+ T cells (CD45.2+) were labeled
with 2.5 μmol/L CFSE and 2 × 106 of these cells were transferred i.v. into naïve C57BL/6.SJL mice (CD45.1+). OT-I T-cell
division in draining lymph nodes was assessed 3 days later
by analyzing the CFSE dilution of CD45.2+CD8+ T cells using
flow cytometry. The direct effect of conjugate vaccine on T-cell
proliferation was assessed using CFSE-labeled OT-I and OT-II
CD4+ T (CD45.2+) cells in an adoptive transfer model as previously described (6). The same protocol was used for the tracking of OT-I T cells in C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 4-1BB−/− mice,
except OT-I T-cell proliferation was assessed by analyzing the
CFSE dilution of Vβ5.1/5.2+CD8+ T cells using flow cytometry.
Tumor models and vaccination. For tumor therapeutic
studies, mice were challenged s.c. with 1 × 105 TC-1 or 3LL
cells and vaccinated on day 6 posttumor challenge. For the
TC-1 lung metastasis model, 5 × 104 TC-1 cells were injected
i.v. into the tail vein, vaccinated i.v. on day 6 posttumor challenge, and euthanized 21 days after tumor challenge for analysis of lung metastasis and tumor burden.
Immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor-infiltrating CD8+
T cells and CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells. Mice bearing TC-1 tumors
of ∼3 to 4 mm in diameter were injected s.c. with conjugated
SA-4-1BBL-E7 (25–10 μg), nonconjugated SA-4-1BBL+E7 (25 +
10 μg), or control conjugated SA-E7 (10–10 μg). Seven days later,
tumors were dissected, washed, embedded in optimum cutting
temperature (OCT), and snap-frozen in optimal cutting temperature solution. Five-micrometer sections were analyzed for
confocal staining of CD8+ T cells as previously reported (7).
For CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells staining, tumor sections were incubated with rat anti-mouse CD4 Ab for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, sections were incubated with goat
anti-rat Alexa 647, counterstained with Hoechst 33342, followed
by staining with anti-FoxP3 Ab-FITC and analyzed by confocal.
Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or log-rank test using the
SPSS software. For each test, P values of <0.05 and 0.001 were
considered significant (*) and very significant (**), respectively.

vivo for increased antigen uptake, cross-presentation,
and generation of effective T-cell responses. A subset of

DCs constitutively expresses 4-1BB and signaling through
this receptor results in DC activation (9, 10). We tested
whether DCs internalize SA-4-1BBL upon receptor binding.
SA-4-1BBL bound to a subpopulation of wild-type, but not
4-1BB−/−, DCs in vitro and was rapidly internalized at 37°C
(Fig. 1A). Therefore, we sought to test if antigen uptake
and presentation by DCs could be enhanced in vivo using
SA-4-1BBL–conjugated Ova as a model antigen. Based on
the most effective vaccine dose reported in our previous
study (7), we prepared a conjugate vaccine by mixing 10 μg
of biotinylated Ova with 25 μg of SA-4-1BBL. Western blot
analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1) showed that over 20% of
Ova were conjugated to SA-4-BBL as assessed by densitometry (data not shown). Injection of mice s.c. with SA-4-1BBL
conjugated to Ova-FITC resulted in amplified increased Ova accumulation in total CD11chi DCs (23.2%) in draining lymph nodes
compared with nonconjugate SA-4-1BBL+Ova vaccine (15.0%)
and Ova alone (6.0%; Fig. 1B). The conjugate vaccine enhanced
antigen uptake by lymphoid DCs (CD11chiCD11b−CD8α+; 39.6%
versus 26.3% for nonconjugate vaccine and 12.3% for Ova alone),
myeloid DCs (CD11chiCD11b+CD8α−; 27.7% versus 13.0% for
nonconjugate vaccine and 4.3% for Ova alone), and plasmacytoid DCs (CD11cintCD11b−B220+; 13.9% versus 10.3% for nonconjugate vaccine and 3.1% for Ova alone; Fig. 1B). Overall, the
increase in antigen uptake by these three DC subtypes investigated was >3.2-fold for conjugate vaccine and >2.1-fold for
nonconjugate vaccine compared with Ova alone and confirms
our previous findings (7). Notably, we did not detect Ova uptake by other APCs including B cells and macrophages (data
not shown).
The conjugate vaccine also resulted in increased Ova crosspresentation by total CD11chi DCs (10.4%) compared with
nonnconjugate vaccine (7.1%) and Ova alone (5.2%; Fig. 1C)
as assessed by a mAb (25-D1.16) recognizing the dominant
CD8+ T-cell epitope SIINFEKL in the context of H-2Kb. Effect
of the conjugate vaccine was mostly on lymphoid DCs as >21%
of these cells scored positive for SIINFEKL/H-2Kb versus 10.9%
for nonconjugate vaccine and 6.2% for Ova alone (Fig. 1C).
Conjugate vaccine also increased the cross-presentation of
Ova by myeloid DCs (5.4% versus 3.3% for nonconjugate vaccine and 2.7% for Ova alone; Fig. 1C). However, there was no
effect on plasmacytoid DCs (Fig. 1C). The conjugation effect
on lymphoid DCs was long lasting as a significant portion of
these cells scored positive for SIINFEKL/H-2Kb on days 4 and
7 postvaccination (Supplementary Fig. S2). In marked contrast,
there was no detectable cross presentation by myeloid DCs on
day 4 postvaccination (data not shown). The increased crosspresentation was dependent on a functional 4-1BB receptor
because this effect was abolished in 4-1BB−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. S3).
To further confirm that SA-4-1BBL targets DCs for immune
activation and that the increased cross-presentation by DCs
enhances CD8+ T-cell responses in vivo, mice were immunized with conjugate SA-4-1BBL-Ova vaccine, nonconjugate
SA-4-1BBL+Ova, and Ova alone either 24 or 48 hours before
transfer of CFSE-labeled Ova-specific CD8+ OT-I T cells. Immunization with the conjugate vaccine resulted in greater
proliferation of OT-I T cells (Fig. 1D) in a dose-dependent

Figure 1. SA-4-1BBL targets conjugated antigen in vivo to DCs for enhanced uptake and cross-presentation. A, bone marrow–derived DCs internalize
SA-4-1BBL following 4-1BB binding. DCs from wild-type and 4-1BB−/− C57BL/6 mice were incubated with SA-4-1BBL-FITC at 4°C for receptor binding, washed,
and then incubated for 1 h at 4°C or 37°C for internalization. CD11c (red) DCs from wild-type, but not 4-1BB−/−, mice internalize SA-4-1BBL (green) at 37°C,
but not 4°C. A minimum of three fields per slide were analyzed. B, SA-4-1BBL-Ova conjugates enhance antigen uptake by DCs in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were
injected s.c. with conjugated SA-4-1BBL-Ova-FITC (25-10 μg), nonconjugated SA-4-1BBL+Ova-FITC (25 + 10 μg), Ova-FITC alone (10 μg), or left nontreated.
Draining lymph node cells were harvested 24 h later, stained with CD11c-PE, CD11b-PErcp-Cy5.5, B220-PEcy7, and CD8α-APC-cy7 Abs, and analyzed in
flow cytometry. Data for A and B are representative of two independent experiments. C, SA-4-1BBL-Ova conjugates increase antigen cross-presentation by
DCs in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated as in B, except Ova without FITC was used as antigen. Draining lymph node cells were harvested 24 h later and
subjected to Ab staining as in B. APC-conjugated 25D1.16 Ab was used to detect Kb/SIINFEKL on the surface of DCs. D, SA-4-1BBL-Ova conjugates result
in increased antigen presentation to OT-I CD8+ T cells in vivo. C57BL/6.SJL (CD45.1+) mice were immunized s.c. with Ova (10 μg) conjugated or nonconjugated
with various doses (μg) of SA-4-1BBL as indicated. Sorted OT-I T cells (CD45.2+; 2 × 106) were labeled with CFSE and injected i.v. 24 or 48 h later. Proliferation
was assessed using flow cytometry 3 d later. Data are representative of a minimum of three independent experiments for C and D.

manner compared with nonconjugate vaccine and Ova alone.
Importantly, immunization with the conjugate vaccine also resulted in greater proliferation of CD4+ OT-II T cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that SA-4-1BBL-Ova conjugates are able
to route antigens to both the MHC class I and MHC class II
pathways of antigen presentation. Taken together, these data
show that antigens conjugated to SA-4-1BBL through SA-biotin
interaction can be targeted to DCs in vivo for enhanced uptake,
cross-presentation, and generation of effective T-cell responses.
SA-41BBL conjugate vaccines induce T-cell proliferation

in response to antigenic challenge in vivo (8). Therefore, we
anticipated that the conjugate vaccine would first target DCs
constitutively expressing 4-1BB for the generation of immune
responses in a naive host and then subsequently directly
work on activated T cells that have upregulated 4-1BB receptor. Consistent with this notion, i.v. vaccination with the SA4-1BBL-Ova conjugate generated better proliferative responses
in both CD8+ OT-I and CD4+ OT-II T cells than nonconjugate
vaccine at all doses tested (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the effect of
conjugation was abolished in 4-1BB−/− mice (Fig. 2B), further
substantiating the role of DCs in the efficacy of conjugate vaccine. The enhanced efficacy of conjugate vaccine was even

more pronounced in an in vivo killing assay in which immunization with the SA-4-1BBL-Ova conjugate generated significantly higher endogenous CTL killing responses over
nonconjugate vaccine (79.5 ± 7.6% versus 57.4 ± 10.0% lysis;

Fig. 2C). This immunostimulatory effect of the conjugate vaccine was not confined to Ova as vaccination with SA-4-1BBL
conjugated with the HPV-16 E7 antigen also generated potent
CTL responses in vivo (Fig. 2D).

SA-4-1BBL conjugate vaccines show enhanced efficacy
in therapeutic cancer settings. To test if the enhanced immunomodulatory activity of conjugate vaccine on DCs and
T cells translates into better therapeutic efficacy, we used
the TC-1 cell line expressing HPV-16 E7 oncogene as a transplantable tumor model for cervical cancer. A single s.c. injection of 10 μg of recombinant E7 protein conjugated to 25 μg
of SA-4-1BBL into mice with established TC-1 tumors resulted in a 70% survival rate over a 90-day observation period
(Fig. 3A). In contrast, injection with the nonconjugate vaccine resulted in only a 20% survival rate, whereas all mice
vaccinated with 10 μg of E7 conjugated with 10 μg of SA
(equimolar to 25 μg SA-4-1BBL) expired within 40 days.
Importantly, animals with eradicated tumors retained
long-term immunologic memory as assessed by increased
E7 peptide–specific in vivo killing responses (Fig. 3B) and
production of IFN-γ and IL-2 by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
(Fig. 3C). Consistent with the general role of 4-1BB signaling
in the development and maintenance of T-cell memory, we
observed a significant increase in CD4+CD44hiCD62Llow effector memory and CD8+CD44hiCD43− total memory T cells in
tumor-free long-term mice vaccinated with the conjugate vaccines compared with controls (Fig. 3D). The conjugate vaccine
generated significantly enhanced CD8+CD44hiCD43− total memory pool compared with nonconjugate vaccine, whereas this dif-

ference was not significant for the CD4+CD44hiCD62Llow effector
memory pool.
Importantly, the better therapeutic efficacy of conjugate
vaccine correlated with significantly increased CD8+ T cells
and decreased CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells within the tumors compared with nonconjugate vaccine or controls (Fig. 4A), resulting in a significantly increased intratumoral CD8+ Teff/Treg
cell ratio (Fig. 4B).
We further confirmed the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of
the conjugate vaccine in the 3LL mouse lung carcinoma model
using recombinant survivin protein as a self-TAA. A single s.c.
injection of mice with established 3LL tumors with a conjugate vaccine consisting of 10 μg of recombinant survivin

over a 90-day observation period (Fig. 5). In contrast, immunization with a nonconjugate vaccine resulted in <40%
survival rate, whereas all control mice immunized with survivin-SA (10 + 10 μg) expired within 50 days.
SA-4-1BBL conjugate vaccine shows therapeutic efficacy in
a metastatic lung tumor model. Metastasis is the cause of 90%
of human deaths from cancer. Therefore, we tested whether
conjugate vaccine shows therapeutic efficacy in a TC-1 lung
metastasis model (21). A single i.v. injection of 10 μg of recombinant E7 protein conjugated to 25 μg of SA-4-1BBL into mice
with established metastatic TC-1 tumors resulted in almost

SA-4-1BBL for Cancer Vaccines

Figure 4. SA-4-1BBL conjugate vaccine increases the intratumoral CD8+ Teff/Treg ratio. A, vaccination with SA-4-1BBL-E7 conjugates increased
intratumoral CD8+ T cells and decreased CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells, as determined by confocal microscopy, resulting in increased ratio of intratumoral

Discussion
DCs coordinate innate, adaptive, and regulatory immune
responses and, as such, have been the target of various therapeutic cancer vaccine strategies that aim to exploit the
exceptional T-cell immunostimulatory features of these cells
for improved efficacy (4). Targeting antigens to DCs by various means without providing proper activation and maturation stimuli can result in T-cell tolerance (22), induction of
Treg cells (23), and increased expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4,
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and IL-10 by antigenspecific CD4+ T cells (24). Therapeutic studies in humans

showed that DC maturation is required for the generation of
effective immunity (25). In view of these findings, various strategies delivering antigens to DCs in vivo by targeting specialized receptors such as DEC205 (22, 26), Clec9A (27), the
mannose receptor (28), and Dectin-1 (29) required toll-like receptor ligands or agonistic anti-CD40 Abs as adjuvants to mature the targeted DCs for the generation of endogenous CTL
responses and tumor eradication. Although various adjuvants
have shown efficacy in preclinical models, their toxic side effects may limit their use at therapeutic doses in humans,
thereby compromising vaccine efficacy (30–32). In contrast,
SA-4-1BBL showed superior therapeutic efficacy as a component of E7 peptide–based vaccine over various toll-like receptor ligands (LPS, monophosphoryl lipid A, and CpG) and an
agonistic Ab to 4-1BB (7) without the severe toxicity associated

Figure 6. SA-4-1BBL conjugates serve as an effective therapeutic vaccine in TC-1 lung metastasis model. C57BL/6 mice (n = 3 per group) were challenged
with live TC-1 cells by i.v. tail injection and vaccinated i.v. on day 6 posttumor challenge with E7 (10 μg) conjugated with SA-4-1BBL (25 μg) or an
equimolar quantity of SA (10 μg). A, mice were euthanized 21 d after tumor challenge and lungs were weighed and (B) photographed after injection with

with these adjuvants (6). Additionally, unlike these vaccine
approaches that rely on an adjuvant for DC activation, we
report that SA-4-1BBL not only delivers antigens to DCs
but also activates DCs for enhanced antigen uptake and presentation, and importantly further amplifies the generated
immune responses in antigen-specific manner by directly targeting activated T cells for expansion, survival, and establishment of long-term memory (6, 7).
SA-4-1BBL was internalized upon binding 4-1BB receptor
on DCs and SA-4-1BBL specifically targeted the conjugated
Ova to CD11chigh DCs in vivo, but not other APC types, such
as B cells that can induce tolerance (33) and macrophages
that can rapidly eliminate targeted antigen (34), leading to
decreased immune efficacy. Although all three analyzed DC
subsets, lymphoid, myeloid, and plasmacytoid, showed
enhanced antigen uptake, mainly lymphoid DCs exhibited
enhanced and longer duration cross-presentation of the conjugated antigen. Lymphoid DCs specialize in cross-presentation
of exogenous antigens on MHC class I (35, 36) and promote
Th1 responses through the production of IL-12 (37). Although
SA-4-1BBL greatly enhanced the presentation of SIINFEKL
on MHC class I, it is presently unknown if enhanced crosspresentation is the direct effect of signaling through the 4-1BB
receptor or is simply the byproduct of enhanced antigen uptake
by DCs. The timing of signals required for DC maturation significantly affects the antigen cross-presentation capability of
these cells, as stimuli too long before or too long after the capture of antigens may impair cross-presentation (38). Importantly, conjugate vaccines using SA-4-1BBL generated potent
T-cell proliferative responses and effector functions, suggesting
that our vaccine approach avoids complications arising from
the timing of antigen capture and delivery of maturation signals. Although our data attributes the robust therapeutic efficacy of the conjugate vaccine to DC targeting because DCs are
the only APCs to constitutively express 4-1BB receptor in a
naïve host, once the immune response is initiated by the vaccine or tumor itself, an immune-activating microenvironment
may lead to the upregulation of 4-1BB on various other immune cell types, such as macrophages, natural killer, and

3952

NKT cells, which can then perpetuate the response. Moreover,
the efficacy of conjugate vaccine does not seem to be due to
the presence of higher SA-4-1BBL aggregates with improved
immunostimulatory activity because both conjugate and nonconjugate vaccines had similar effects on T-cell proliferation
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Cross-presentation of antigens by DCs to CD8+ T cells in the
absence of Th1 cell help may result in unproductive primary
(39) and memory (40) CD8+ T-cell responses. Importantly, vaccination with SA-4-1BBL-Ova conjugates enhanced the antigen
uptake by myeloid DCs, which are perceived specialized
APCs for CD4+ T cells due to their expression of relatively high
levels of proteins implicated in the MHC class II presentation
pathway (41). Consistent with this notion, vaccination with
SA-4-1BBL-Ova conjugates generated a potent CD4+ T-cell
proliferative response that was partially dependent on DCs.
Furthermore, immunization with conjugate vaccines, including HPV E7 or survivin as TAAs, in tumor-bearing mice resulted in strong CD4+ T-cell responses. In addition, SA-4-1BBL
conjugates increased antigen uptake by plasmacytoid DCs,
which specialize in antiviral responses through the secretion of
IFN-α and cross-present viral antigens to CD8+ T cells. This suggests that SA-4-1BBL can be used as an immunomodulator/
delivery vehicle component of vaccines against viruses.
Treg cells represent a major barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy with high abundance of Treg cells in tumors
associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients (42),
whereas a high Teff/Treg cell ratio positively correlates with
successful therapies (43). Vaccination of mice with established TC-1 tumors resulted in greatly increased numbers
of CD8+ T cells and decreased numbers of Treg cells within
the tumor, resulting in a favorable Teff/Treg cell ratio. Although the exact nature of implicated mechanisms are not
known, it is possible that SA-4-1BBL treatment affects the
trafficking and entry of both Teff and Treg cells into the tumor microenvironment by regulating the expression of relevant chemokine receptors on T cells and/or their respective
ligands in the tumor microenvironment. SA-4-1BBL treatment
might also preferentially improve the survival of CD8+ T cells

over Treg cells or prevent the conversion of CD4+ Teff into
Treg cells, which has recently been shown for OX40, another
tumor necrosis factor receptor family member (44). Furthermore, the initial action of SA-4-1BBL on DCs and T cells may
have secondary consequences to the tumor microenvironment, permitting a therapeutic window for antitumor immunity. Treatments targeting OX40 using an agonist Ab resulted
in significant changes in tumor stroma, leading to decreased
Treg cells, macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells,
and expression of TGF-β (45).
In conclusion, we herein corroborate our recent studies
showing the potent pleiotropic effects of SA-4-1BBL on various
cells of the immune system (6, 7) and further show its use as a
vehicle to target antigens in vivo to DCs for enhanced uptake,
cross-presentation, and activation of both CD4+ and CD8+
T cells; their gain of effector functions; establishment of
long-term memory; and therapeutic efficacy in three different tumor models. The potent immunomodulatory effects
of SA-4-1BBL requires SA as the structural component of
the molecule allowing SA-4-1BBL to exist as tetramers and
oligomers (data not shown) that can cross-link the 4-1BB
receptor for potent signal transduction, as a trimeric form of
4-1BBL has no costimulatory activity on T cells (Supplementary Fig. S5; ref. 18). Therefore, SA-4-1BBL represents a novel
immunomodulator with significant potential for the develop-

ment of therapeutic vaccines against cancer and chronic infections. Importantly, 4-1BB is also constitutively expressed on
human DCs (46), allowing for eventual translation of our conjugate vaccine concept to human clinical application.
