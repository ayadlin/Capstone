ABSTRACT
CD47 is a signaling receptor for thrombospondin-1 and the counter-receptor
for signal-regulatory protein-α (SIRPα). By inducing inhibitory SIRPα signaling,
elevated CD47 expression by some cancers prevents macrophage phagocytosis.
The anti-human CD47 antibody B6H12 inhibits tumor growth in several xenograft
models, presumably by preventing SIRPα engagement. However, CD47 signaling in
nontransformed and some malignant cells regulates self-renewal, suggesting that
CD47 antibodies may therapeutically target cancer stem cells (CSCs). Treatment
of MDA-MB-231 breast CSCs with B6H12 decreased proliferation and asymmetric
cell division. Similar effects were observed in T47D CSCs but not in MCF7 breast
carcinoma or MCF10A breast epithelial cells. Gene expression analysis in breast CSCs
treated with B6H12 showed decreased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and the stem cell transcription factor KLF4. EGFR and KLF4 mRNAs are known
targets of microRNA-7, and B6H12 treatment correspondingly enhanced microRNA-7
expression in breast CSCs. B6H12 treatment also acutely inhibited EGF-induced EGFR
tyrosine phosphorylation. Expression of B6H12-responsive genes correlated with
CD47 mRNA expression in human breast cancers, suggesting that the CD47 signaling
pathways identified in breast CSCs are functional in vivo. These data reveal a novel
SIRPα-independent mechanism by which therapeutic CD47 antibodies could control
tumor growth by autonomously forcing differentiation of CSC.

INTRODUCTION

tumor cells have limited proliferative capacity and cannot
form new tumors.
Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of
breast cancer, these cancers frequently recur with a relapse
time of 5-7 years [3]. One proposed mechanism is that
CSCs are more resistant to chemoradiation therapies and
persist in a dormant state during therapy but later initiate
tumor regrowth. As few as 100 CD133+-expressing
brain and breast cancer cells were sufficient to establish

Breast progenitor cells play an active role in the
cyclic changes that take place during pregnancy and
ovulation in women [1, 2]. A minor subset of tumor
cells has the capacity to initiate a new tumor upon
transplantation into a healthy host. These tumor initiating
cells have stem cell-like properties and are also known as
cancer stem cells (CSCs). In contrast to CSCs, the bulk

a new cancer in non-obese diabetic, severe combined
immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice. In contrast,
engrafted CD133- cells did not form tumors [4, 5]. Flow
cytometric analysis has shown that a CD44high and CD24low
population is enriched in CSCs [6]. However, most
existing therapies to treat solid tumors do not efficiently
target cancer stem cells.
Breast cancers comprise four major molecular
subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, triple negative/basallike, and HER2 type [7]. Triple negative breast cancers
(TNBC) represent approximately 20% of cases and are
defined by their lack of expression of estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor, and human epidermal
growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). TNBC highly express
epidermal growth factor receptor-1 (EGFR) and are
highly proliferative, aggressive and resistant to systemic
chemotherapies. Consequently, outcome for these
patients is poor compared to ER+ and HER2+ cancers.
Approximately 30-40% of deaths are caused by recurrence
and metastasis of TNBC. Even though EGFR inhibitors
have shown some promise for treating TNBC [8], no
FDA approved targeted therapies have improved patient
outcome for TNBC. Thus, there is urgency to identify
signaling pathways required for TNBC and develop
therapies targeting these pathways.
The ubiquitous cell surface protein CD47 is upregulated in many cancers, and its high expression is a
negative prognostic indicator for several cancers including
invasive breast cancer [9, 10]. One proposed function of
elevated CD47 expression on CSC is to serve as a “don’t
eat me” signal that protects the CSC from phagocytic
clearance by macrophages [11]. Consequently, antibody
and recombinant protein therapeutics that engage CD47
and block SIRPα binding have been developed to
stimulate the destruction of CSC by macrophages [9].
The CD47 antibody B6H12 blocks the recognition of
CD47 by its counter-receptor SIRPα on macrophages.
Human tumors grown in immunodeficient NOD-SCID
mice that express a variant of SIRPα that binds human
CD47 with high affinity have been used to test the ability
of B6H12 to enhance macrophage-mediated clearance of
human tumor xenografts [10]. Inhibition of tumor growth
by B6H12 in these models provided evidence to support
the humanization of related CD47 antibodies for treating
human cancer patients, which have now entered several
human clinical trials (NCT02216409, NCT02367196,
NCT02096770). Based in part on evidence that B6H12
has effects on CD47 signaling that are independent of
blocking SIRPα binding [9, 12, 13], however, others
have concluded that the CD47/SIRPα hypothesis is
not sufficient to explain the antitumor activity of CD47
blockade and have reported that CD47 is more than a
passive SIRPα counter-receptor.
Here we present evidence for an unanticipated
activity of B6H12 in CSCs. We demonstrate a signaling
role of the prototypical CD47 blocking antibody B6H12
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

on breast CSC but not differentiated cells isolated from the
MDA-MB-231 cell line. These data provide evidence that
this CD47 antibody can function independent of its known
ligands thrombospondin-1 and SIRPα and should be
considered a pharmacological agonist of CD47 signaling.

RESULTS
Characterization of breast CSCs derived from
suspension cell-enriched MDA-MB-231 cells
Routinely cultured MDA-MB-231 cells display
abundant loosely attached round cells as well as firmly
attached spread cells (Figure 1A). Previous studies have
documented that the former cells form mammospheres,
express characteristic bCSC markers, and are more
tumorigenic in a murine xenograft model [14]. The
loosely attached cells could be harvested by gentle
shaking (Figure 1B) and formed aggregates within 10
days at 37 °C in cancer stem cell medium (Figure 1C).
The presence of CD44high and CD24low cancer stem/
progenitor cells is a hallmark of aggressive metastatic
TNBC [15]. As previously reported [14], the loosely
attached cells expressed more surface CD44 than the
firmly attached MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1D). Gene
expression analysis by q-PCR of CD44 and CD24
mRNA in suspension and attached cells indicated that the
suspension cells have 257-fold up-regulation of CD44 as
compared to attached cells, and re-plating the suspension
cells in stem cell medium further increased CD44 gene
expression (Figure 1E). On the other hand, the suspension
cells expressed 8-fold less CD24 than attached cells,
which did not further change after re-plating (Figure
1F). Global microarray gene expression analysis of these
two subsets indicated that loosely bound MDA-MB-231
cells differentially express many genes characteristic
of CSC (Figure 1G). Among them, 8 transcripts were
significantly upregulated (P = 0.05), and 90 transcripts
were down regulated in suspension cells, including CD24.
(Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2). Based
on these characteristics, we hereafter refer to the isolated
suspension cells as bCSC and to the firmly attached cells
as differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells.
We further performed a Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) using existing stem cell gene signatures
from the Broad Institute database. We then generated a list
of stemness gene markers that were present at least in 3
different datasets and show an enrichment (either negative
or positive) with the MDA-231 bCSC versus differentiated
MDA-231 (Supplemental Table 3). The mRNA expression
of some of these gene was then validated by q-PCR using
differentiated and bCSCs cells from TNBC (Figure
S1A-I). Consistent with previous reports of elevated CD47
in CSC [16-19] CD47 showed 2.3-fold higher expressions

in bCSCs, whereas thrombospondin-1 and c-Myc, which
is also suppressed in nontransformed cells by CD47
signaling [20], showed decreased expression in bCSCs
(Figure S2A-S2C).
CSCs share some characteristics with embryonic
stem cells. Correspondingly, real time PCR analysis of
bCSCs revealed up-regulation of OCT4, Nanog, SOX2,
and nestin relative to attached cells (Figure S2D-S2G).
We further observed that bCSCs proliferate faster than
differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1H and 1I),
which is consistent with existing literature [14]. Another
defining characteristic of stem cells is asymmetrical
division.
MDA-MB-231-derived
CSCs
divide
asymmetrically for self-renewal [21], and asymmetric
division is correlated with the CD44high/CD24low
phenotype [22]. We chased BrdU-labeled bCSCs with
unlabeled BrdU to quantify asymmetric DNA template
strand segregation [23]. Differentiated MDA-MB-231
cells and bCSCs were labeled with BrdU for two weeks
and chased for 2 divisions in BrdU-free medium. The
cells were treated with cytochalasin D, and symmetric
versus asymmetric DNA segregation was counted
microscopically. bCSCs enriched for CD44highCD24low
showed an increase in asymmetric cell division (Figure
1J-1K).

NANOG and KLF4 in differentiated cells and bCSCs.
OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG immunostaining did not
change between isotype control and B6H12 treatments
as well as in microarray analysis (data not shown), KLF4
decreased moderately in differentiated cells (Figure
S3A and S3C), but a statistically significant reduction
of KLF4 was observed in bCSCs (Figure 2B and Figure
S3B). Decreased KLF4 protein expression was confirmed
using flow cytometry (Figure 2C). Because KLF4 is an
essential gene for breast cancer stem cell maintenance
and it’s decrease leads to decreased proportion of stem/
progenitor cells [24], B6H12 treatment may reduce the
number of bCSC by down-regulation of KLF4, leading to
the observed inhibition of asymmetric cell division.
To further investigate direct effects of the CD47
blocking antibody B6H12 on bCSCs, we cultured
differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells and bCSCs in the
presence of B6H12 or an isotype-matched control IgG
for 3 days. The CD47 antibody decreased the number
of round non-adherent bCSCs cells (arrows) but had no
effect on the morphology of differentiated MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure S4A-S4B). B6H12 also reduced the size of
mammospheres when bCSCs were cultured for 10 days
using cancer stem cell medium (Figure S4C-S4E).
Proliferaton of the bCSC after 3 or 5 days was
inhibited in the presence of B6H12 but not the isotype
control antibody (Figure 2D). Flow cytometric analysis of
equilibrium BrdU-labeled bCSCs chased with unlabeled
BrdU showed that B6H12 treatment significantly limited
the mean dilution of BrdU compared to isotype control
antibody (Figure 2E). This confirms that ligation of CD47
by B6H12 initiates an anti-proliferative signal in bCSC.
We examined the specificity of the antiproliferative activity
of B6H12 for TNBC by testing two ER+ breast cancer
cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) and a normal immortalized
breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A). Consistent with our
published studies using lung endothelial and T cells, the
CD47 blocking antibody B6H12 increased DNA synthesis
in MCF10A cells (Figure 3B). MCF7, a well-differentiated
ER+ breast carcinoma cell line with limited malignant

CD47 antibody B6H12 inhibits bCSC
proliferation, asymmetric division, and expression
of KLF4
To observe the effect of B6H12 on asymmetric cell
division, bCSCs were labeled with BrdU and chased using
BrdU-free medium in the presence of B6H12 or control
antibody. The cells were immunostained using anti-BrdU
and quantified using confocal microscopy imaging (Figure
2A). The fraction of cells exhibiting asymmetric division
significantly decreased after B6H12 treatment.
We further analyzed effects of B6H12 on expression
of the embryonic stem cell markers OCT4, SOX2,

potential, also exhibited a positive response to B6H12
(Figure 3A). However, the breast carcinoma cell line
T47D and sorted T47D-bCSC showed a similar inhibition
of proliferation by B6H12 as MDA-MB-231 bCSC
(Figure 3C-3D). To verify the sensitivity of bCSC derived

from MDA-MB-231 and T47D, we isolated CD44High/
CD24low cells by sorting and assessed BrdU incorporation.
B6H12 significantly inhibited cell proliferation of these
purified bCSCs derived from MDA-MB-231 and T47D
cells (Figures 2F and 3D). This data indicates that B6H12

in triple negative and certain ER+ breast cancers that have
more tumor initiating cells but is not effective on other
ER positive breast cancers or normal breast epithelial cells

Global microarray assessment of mRNA expression
revealed that B6H12 significantly altered the expression

B6H12 antibody induced a distinct gene expression

Several of the genes that showed altered expression in
bCSC versus differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure

(Figure 4C-4F). B6H12-treated bCSCs showed an upregulation of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP,
Figure 3C) and LOX (lysyl oxidase, Figure 4D), which
are known tumor suppressors [25, 26]. Altered TXNIP
mRNA expression was previously reported following
CD47 knockdown in hepatocellular carcinoma stem cells

transcript expression (Figure 5A, 5B), whereas treatment
with isotype control antibody in the presence or absence
of EGF did not significantly alter mRNA expression of
EGF and EGFR. Specific suppression of EGFR mRNA
expression by B6H12 was reproduced in a second TNBC
cell line (MDA-MB-468, Figure 5C).
The microarray data indicated that several additional
genes involved in signaling or regulation of the EGFR
pathway including NFAT5, CCDC88A/girdin, API5,
EEA1, and IQGAP1 were significantly induced in the
bCSC by B6H12 treatment (Supplemental Table 5), but
these could not directly account for the strong downregulation of EGFR mRNA. However, we noted that
both EGFR and KLF4 mRNAs are known targets of
microRNA-7 (miR-7) in human cancer cells [14, 35].
IGF1R mRNA is another known target of miR-7 and was
also significantly altered by B6H12 (Supplemental Table
5). This suggested a potential mechanism by which B6H12
decreases EGFR expression in TNBC. To investigate if
B6H12 treatment alters expression of miRNA-7, we
measured expression of has-miR-7-5P from differentiated

cells [30, 33, 34]. Treatment of bCSCs with B6H12 for
3 days down-regulated EGFR at the mRNA level on
microarray analysis (Supplemental Table 4). Real time
PCR confirmed that treatment with B6H12 alone or in the
presence of EGF eliminated detectable EGF and EGFR

MDA-MB-231 cells and bCSCs cells. B6H12 significantly
increased miR-7-5P expression in bCSC but had minimal
effects on differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure
5D). Dicer was also upregulated in B6H12 treated bCSCs
(Supplemental Table 5). Dicer is a component of a
complex that cleaves dsRNA precursors to yield functional
miRNAs (21-23). bCSCs express low levels of RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) genes as compared to
differentiated cells (Figure S5A-S5D). However, B6H12
increased mRNA expression of Ago2, DICER, DGCR8
and Drosha but not Ago1 (Figure S5E).

with B6H12 antibody disrupted this interaction and
inhibited EGFR-Y1068 phosphorylation (Figure 6A-6B).
To determine whether B6H12 treatment acutely altered
EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, we pre-treated MDAMB-231 cells for 15 min with B6H12. EGF stimulation
for 5 min significantly increased EGFR phosphorylation
at Y1068. B6H12 treatment in the presence or absence of
EGF inhibited EGFR phosphorylation at Y1068 but not
Y992. B6H12 treatment alone inhibited basal EGFR Y1068
phosphorylation as compared to untreated (Figure 6C-6D).
Similarly, differentiated cells and bCSCs derived from
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with either EGF alone
or in combination with B6H12. B6H12 treatment inhibited
basal and EGF-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation in
bCSCs but not in differentiated cells (Figure 6E). We also
examined Y998 phosphorylation but did not observe any
change (Figure S6A), which is consistent with Figure

B6H12 acutely regulates EGFR signaling
Based on our previous finding that CD47 laterally
associates with the tyrosine kinase receptor VEGFR2 [36],
we asked whether CD47 similarly interacts with EGFR.
Immunoprecipitation revealed that EGFR and a small

CD47 expression in human breast cancers

6C. To further validate these results, we isolated a pure
population of CD44high/CD24low MDA-MB-231 cells by
cell sorting. Stimulation of FACS-sorted bCSCs with EGF
did not further increase EGFR Y1068 phosphorylation, but
B6H12 strongly inhibited EGFR Y1068 phosphorylation
in the absence and presence of co-stimulation with
EGF (Figure S6B). Significant inhibition of EGFR Y1068
phosphorylation was observed using either tubulin or total
EGFR for normalization (Figure S6C-S6D). These data
demonstrate that B6H12 acutely targets EGFR signaling in
bCSCs by down-regulating EGFR phosphorylation.

The relevance of this in vitro bCSC data to human
breast cancers was examined using the Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) mRNA and protein expression data
for invasive breast carcinoma. [37-39]. CD47 mRNA
expression >1 SD higher than the mean by RNAseq
analysis was significantly associated with decreased
overall survival (log rank p-value 0.038, Figure 7A).
Because basal breast carcinomas were previously reported
to express higher CD47 [9] and have a poorer prognosis,
we were concerned that the correlation between survival
and CD47 expression may be an artifact of breast cancer

Figure 6: A. EGFR-immunoprecipitation from MDA-MB-231 cell extracts followed by western blotting shows that B6H12 treatment

for 15 min disrupts the association between EGFR and CD47 and inhibits EGFR-Y1068 phosphorylation. B. CD47-immunoprecipitation
showed that a fraction of EGFR co-immunoprecipitates with EGFR. B6H12 treatment for 15 min reduced interaction between CD47 and
EGFR in MDA-MB-231 cells. (C.-D.) MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with B6H12 for 15 minutes followed by EGF for 5 minutes,
and IP-western blotting was performed using phospho-EGFR antibody. D. Quantification of three experiments was analyzed using the t-test

heterogeneity. Consistent with the diminished sensitivity
of ER+ breast cancer cells to B6H12 observed in vitro,
CD47 mRNA expression in the TCGA dataset was
negatively correlated with ER and with HER2 protein
expression (p = 1.7x10-6 and 2.5x10-5, respectively, Figure
7B, Figure 8A). Furthermore, CD47 expression was

significantly higher in TNBC than in other breast cancers
(Figure 7C, p = 1.7x10-9). Therefore, we excluded other
forms of breast cancer and reexamined the correlation
between CD47 expression and survival in TNBC (Figure
7D). CD47 expression >1 SD higher than the mean was
not associated with decreased survival in these patients

expression in TNBC primary tumors (p = 0.0007). Five
additional genes identified by this analysis (NFAT5, API5,
CCDC88A/girdin, EEA1, and IQGAP1) are involved in
the EGFR pathway [40-45]. Rab12 regulates autophagy,
which mediates the cytoprotective response to CD47
blockade [46]. A number of the identified CD47-dependent
genes including MBP1, TBL1XR1, girdin, cyclin D1,
CDC27, SPAG9, and JAK1 have reported functions in
breast cancer progression [47-54].
Several known stem cell markers correlated with
CD47 mRNA expression in the TCGA breast carcinoma
dataset including a positive correlation with cKit
protein expression (Figure 7F, p = 0.042). In contrast,

(p = 0.206).
In contrast to HER2 but consistent with our in
vitro data, EGFR protein expression in breast tumors
positively correlated with CD47 mRNA expression (p=
0.009, Figure 7E). A comparison of gene expression
altered by B6H12 in bCSC in vitro with gene expression
significantly correlated with CD47 mRNA expression in
the TCGA TNBC primary tumor data was used to identify
additional potential targets of CD47 signaling in TNBC
that could be regulated by B6H12 (Table 1). Sixty genes
achieved significance in both bCSC and TNBC tumor
data. Consistent with the protein expression data, EGFR
mRNA expression positively correlated with CD47 mRNA

phosphorylation of PDK1 at Ser241, which induces a
cancer stem cell gene expression signature [55, 56],
was negatively correlated with CD47 mRNA expression
and was the fourth most significant change in protein
phosphorylation in the breast cancer dataset (Figure 7G,
p = 0.0015). The transcription factor PATZ1 maintains
stem cells by its regulation of Pou5f1, Nanog, cMyc, and
global changes in histone modification [57, 58]. PATZ1
mRNA expression in breast cancers negatively correlated
with CD47 mRNA expression (Spearman correlation =
-0.41, Figure 7H). Similar negative correlations between
PATZ1 and CD47 mRNA expression were found in TCGA
datasets for melanoma (-0.41), head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (-0.46), and bladder carcinoma (-0.49)
(Figure 8B-8D). Therefore, elevated CD47 expression
correlates with known markers and regulators of stem cell
maintenance in breast and other cancers.

preclinical studies based on its ability to block SIRPα
binding [60, 61], has a second activity that could provide
therapeutic benefit by suppressing stem cell character
in bCSC. B6H12 down regulates EGFR expression
at the mRNA and protein levels and inhibits Tyr1068
phosphorylation of EGFR. Currently EGFR inhibitors
are in phase II clinical trials and show efficacy to inhibit
tumor growth in xenograft models [62-65]. The correlation
between CD47 and EGFR expression in human breast
tumors suggests that therapeutic CD47 antibodies may be
effective against tumors with high EGFR expression when
used alone or in combination with EGFR inhibitors.
MiR-7 has characteristics of a tumor suppressor in
breast cancers and is an emerging cancer therapeutic target
[66, 67]. MiR-7 down-regulates expression of KLF4 in
breast cancer stem cells [14] and suppresses EGFR mRNA
in several cancers by binding to sites in its 3’-UTR [35].
KLF4-dependent suppression of stem cells by miR-7
expression has also been reported in prostate cancer [68].
Thus, B6H12 induction of miR-7-5P could account for the
observed activity of B6H12 to decrease EGFR and KLF4
expression in bCSC. Because elevated miR-7 expression
was reported to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis
of breast cancer cells [69], the induction of miR-7 in bCSC
by B6H12 may also contribute to the observed inhibition
of bCSC proliferation by this CD47 antibody.
B6H12 may also limit tumor growth by inhibiting
asymmetric division of CSCs. This activity was observed
in a TNBC line, but not in the less aggressive MCF7
cell line or MCF10 immortalized mammary epithelial
cells, which showed increased proliferation that is
consistent with our primary endothelial cell data [20].
Our data and recent reports that shRNA knockdown of
CD47 suppressed CSCs in hepatocellular carcinoma
[17] and mammospheres formation in the SUM159
breast carcinoma cell line [19] suggest that direct cellautonomous effects of therapeutic CD47 antibodies to
suppress CSC may extend to additional cancers.
Others have shown that certain CD47 antibodies,
but not B6H12, directly induce apoptosis of B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia associated with cell shrinkage,
decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and
phosphatidylserine externalization, but independent of
apoptotic caspase activation [70]. These studies suggest
that each CD47 antibody may have different effects
on CD47 signaling, which may involve direct agonist
activities of a given antibody as well as antagonism of the
signals induced by SIRPα or TSP1 binding.
In summary, these data demonstrate that CD47 is an
active signaling receptor in triple negative human breast
carcinoma cells. The CD47 antibody B6H12 directly
inhibits cell growth and CSC maintenance in an aggressive
subset of the breast cancer cell lines we have tested,
whereas stimulation of proliferation was also observed in
cell lines with less malignant potential, which is consistent
with known CD47 signaling in non-transformed cells.

DISCUSSION
The premise for developing therapeutic antibodies
that target CD47 was that high expression of this cell
surface protein protects tumor cells from host innate
immune surveillance [16]. However, we previously
reported that expression of CD47 in non-transformed cells
plays a critical role in regulating stem cell homeostasis.
Specifically, CD47 signaling inhibits the expression of
cMyc, SOX2, OCT3/4 and KLF4 [20]. Decreasing CD47
in non-transformed cells increases their self-renewal,
asymmetric division and ability to reprogram into other
differentiated cell types. Because, high CD47 expression
limits the stem cell character of non-transformed cells, the
high expression of CD47 on cancer stem cells appeared
paradoxical, suggesting that the CD47 expressed on
CSC may lack the signaling activity to control stem cell
self-renewal, either due to alterations in the CD47 or
inactivation of pathways that mediate its signaling in CSC.
Recent studies in hepatocellular carcinoma stem cells and
a breast carcinoma cell line demonstrated that reducing
CD47 expression results in loss of stem cell character
[17, 19], suggesting that CD47 signaling differentially
regulates normal versus malignant stem cells. Conversely,
treatment with the CD47 ligand thrombospondin-1 was
recently reported to inhibit proliferation, sphere formation,
and expression of stem cell transcription factors in Lewis
lung carcinoma cells, and CD47 shRNA knockdown
blocked this activity [59]. Our results indicate that bCSC
express both high levels of CD47 and characteristic stem
cell genes. Treatment with B6H12 down regulates KLF4
and inhibits asymmetric cell division of bCSCs, indicating
that CD47 is capable of transducing a signal in bCSC. The
treated cells resemble differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells
and have limited proliferative capacity. This suggests that
CD47 expression supports bCSC maintenance.
From a therapeutic perspective, our data indicates
that the CD47 antibody B6H12, which was selected for

or Isotype control antibody (1 µg/ml) for 5 days. BrdU
staining was performed using BrdU Cell Proliferation Kit
2752 from EMD Millipore. BrdU negative and positive
for DAPI for DNA segregation was counted manually. The
total numbers of DAPI were divided by BrdU negative
cells. The untreated or control asymmetric cells were
normalized to 1. The ratio of B6H12 was determined as
compared to 1 (control).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
The breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-468, MCF7, MCF10A and T47D1 cells were
purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured at
37°C in 5% CO2 using Gibco RPMI 1640 medium with
10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The bCSCs were
cultured using cancer stem cell media from (ProMab,
Richmond, CA). APC-conjugated antibodies for EGF
and human KLF4 were obtained from R&D Systems.
Antibodies specific for EGFR and phospho-Tyr1175
EGFR, actin, NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 were obtained
from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), CD47 antibody
B6H12 from (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and Human
anti-human CD47-FITC (BD Biosciences). Functional
grade purified anti-human CD47-B6H12 and isotypematched control ant8ibody were from eBioscience,
(San Diego, CA), Anti-BrdU APC, EGFR-PE, CD44FITC, CD24-PE conjugated and Isotype isotype control
antibodies were obtained from Bio Legend. Cytochalasin
D and anti-tubulin were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
For functional studies B6H12 and its isotype-matched
control antibody were used at 1 µg/ml for all experiments
throughout the manuscript using RPMI medium containing
2% FBS .

Flow cytometry
MDA-MB-231 and bCSCs cells were stained with
either isotype control antibody or anti-CD44-FITC and
anti-CD24-PE antibodies for 30 min. at room temperature.
For intracellular staining, bCSCs cells were stimulated
with Leukocyte Activation Cocktail, with GolgiPlusTM
(BD Pharmingen) for 6 hours at 37oC before being
stained with anti-KLF4 using Foxp3 staining buffer set
kit (eBiosciences). Cells were analyzed using a LSR II
System flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data
were subsequently analyzed and presented using FlowJO
software (TreeStar).

RNA extraction and real-time PCR
CSC-depleted MDA-MB-231 and bCSCs were
plated at 1×106 cells in 6-well plates and were-treated
with B6H12 or Isotype control antibody (1 µg/ml) for 36
h. Total RNA was extracted using TriPure (Roche). One
μg of total RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis
using a Maxima kit (2-Step RT PCR, Thermo Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real time
PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Roche) on
an MJ Research Opticon I instrument (Bio-Rad) with
the amplification program as described in [72]. β2microglobulin (B2M), HPRT1 or 18S rRNA primers were
used as control to normalize mRNA expression.

Asymmetric cell division
MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC) were labeled with
5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for two weeks. The cells
were then grown in BrdU-free medium for at least two
consecutive cell divisions. The numbers of asymmetric
cells were quantified as described [14, 15]. With gentle
agitation of the flask, loosely bound bCSCs were separated
from adherent MDA-MB-231 cells. bCSCs form loose
aggregates after incubation at 37°C. Adherent MDAMB-231 and enriched bCSCs cells were labeled with
BrdU for 10 days and then chased in BrdU free medium
for 3-4 days and followed by 2 µM cytochalasin. The cells
were immunostained using BrdU antibody and mounted
with Vectashield DAPI. The confocal images were taken
using a Zeiss 780 microscope at 63X and the asymmetric
cell division ratio between cells negative for BrdU and
positive for DAPI was calculated [20] [23]. [71]

Technologies) .
To analyze gene set enrichment within our data,
we used GSEA reference [73] [74]. The GSEA algorithm
computes a ranked list of all genes from a microarray
comparison between two conditions and identifies whether
individual members of an a priori functionally defined
gene set (black vertical bars) are enriched at either the top
(red area) or bottom of the ranked genes (blue area) or
randomly distributed across the whole ranked gene list,
using a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. These
predefined gene sets are part of a functionally wellestablished and /or published pathway from databases
like KEGG, BioCarta, Reactome and gene ontology.
An enrichment score (Green Graph) is calculated based
on the level to which a gene set is overrepresented
at the top (positive correlation) or bottom (negative
correlation) of the ranked gene list and is calculated as
the maximum deviation from zero. Genes occurring at the
very extreme (dark red or dark blue area) on either side
of the ranked list are weighted more heavily compared
with genes occurring in the middle (light red or light blue
area) of the ranked gene list that contain genes that are
not differentially expressed. Statistical significance is
defined by the p-value, which is also adjusted for multiple
hypothesis testing. A gene set-based permutation test of
1.000 permutations was applied and genes were ranked
according to Student’s t statistic. All other parameters were
set to GSEA defaults. The Broad Molecular Signatures
Database v5.0 (MSigDB), actually consist of over 4000
different gene sets. Alternatively, we used microarray
datasets from the GEO database to derive gene sets that
we then used for GSEA analysis [5, 6]. http://www.

Cell Linker Kit according to the manufacturer’s conditions
via flow cytometry analysis. The raw data of one
representative flow cytometric analysis of cell proliferation
of differentiated cells (left panel) and bCSCs (right panel
are presented in Figure S2H. For relative MFI of three
experiments, differentiated and bCSCs were normalized
as 100% at day 0.
The bCSCs were treated with B6H12 or isotype

Microarray processing and analysis
Samples were prepared according to Affymetrix
protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). RNA quality and
quantity was ensured using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA) and NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA) respectively. Per RNA labeling, 500 nanograms of
total RNA was used in conjunction with the Affymetrix
recommended protocol for the HG_U133_Plus 2.0 chips.
The hybridization cocktail containing the fragmented and
labeled cDNAs was hybridized to the Affymetrix Human
HG_U133_Plus 2.0 GeneChip. The chips were washed
and stained by the Affymetrix Fluidics Station using the
standard format and protocols as described by Affymetrix
and the Affymetrix Gene Chip Scanner 3000 was used
to scan the probe arrays. Gene expression intensities
were extracted using Affymetrix AGCC software. Partek
Genomic Suite was used to RMA normalize (Robust

and run the ANOVA analysis. The raw data is deposited
in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE67966

Immunoprecipitation and western blots
bCSC-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells and bCSCs
were plated at 1×106 cells/well in 6-well plates. The
cells were serum-starved for 2 hours using serum-free
RPMI medium. The cells were pre-treated with B6H12
(1 µg/ml) for 20 min. Cell lysates were made using
immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM
NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) along with 1× Complete
Mini-protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science).
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min.
A BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) was used to quantify
total protein. Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were used for
Immunoprecipitation. The Dynabeads were washed
three times with activation buffer. The cell lysates were
incubated in Dynabeads-protein G along with anti-EGFR
and CD47 antibodies (1:500) and incubated for 24 hours
at 4°C on a shaker. The beads were washed three times
with lysate buffer and heated at 95°C for 5 min. The
immunoprecipitated cell lysates were loaded on 4-12%
