ABL Regulation by AXL Promotes Cisplatin Resistance in
Esophageal Cancer
Jun Hong, DunFa Peng, Zheng Chen, Vikas Sehdev, and Abbes Belkhiri

Abstract
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is characterized by resistance to chemotherapy and poor outcome.
Although cisplatin (CDDP) has been used as a ﬁrst-line therapy in patients with EAC, resistance remains a
major clinical problem. The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, originally isolated as a transforming gene from
leukemia, is overexpressed in several solid tumors. Herein, we assessed AXL protein expression in human EACs
and examined its role in CDDP resistance in human EAC cells. AXL overexpression was detected in more than
50% of tumors examined. Elevating AXL in nonoverexpressing cells doubled the CDDP IC50 and increased cell
survival three-fold, while attenuating AXL in overexpressing cells reduced survival two-fold. The effects of AXL
modulation on cell survival were associated with changes in cellular and molecular markers of apoptosis.
Mechanistic investigations revealed that AXL blocked CDDP-induced activation of endogenous p73b (TP73),
reducing its protein half-life, and inhibited CDDP-induced levels of p-c-ABL(Y412) and p-p73b(Y99). These
changes were associated with a disruption of c-ABL/p73b protein interactions due to association with c-ABL in
the cytoplasm, thereby blocking nuclear accumulation of c-ABL and phosphorylation of p73b in response to DNA
damage. Together, our results establish that AXL promotes CDDP resistance in esophageal adenocarcinoma and
argue that therapeutic targeting of AXL may sensitize these cancers to DNA-damaging drugs. Cancer Res; 73(1);

Introduction
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has
sharply increased by 6-fold in the United States in the last few
decades (1, 2). One of the major risk factors for developing EAC
is gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD), which may lead to
Barrett's esophagus, a known premalignant lesion that transforms into invasive cancer by progressing through intermediate stages of low- and high-grade dysplasia (reviewed in ref. 3).
Unfortunately, the majority of patients with EAC are mostly
diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease, which may
reﬂect their poor prognosis (4). Generally, the treatment of
advanced EAC involves neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation followed by esophagectomy (5).
The cancer chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (CDDP, cisdiamminedichloroplatinum) exerts its cytotoxic effect by
inducing DNA damage and causing apoptosis through activation of the tumor-suppressor p53 protein (6). Although deﬁcient p53 expression renders cancer cells less responsive to

cisplatin-based chemotherapy, drug resistance is not complete.
In fact, the p73 protein, a member of the p53 family, can also
induce apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress (7) and
cisplatin (6). A previous study showed that cisplatin increased
p73 protein levels through activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-ABL. Yuan and colleagues (8) showed that c-ABL
binds and phosphorylates the p73 protein on a tyrosine residue
(Y99) in response to DNA damage, and disruption of the c-ABL/
p73 interaction blocked apoptosis. Cisplatin, alone or in combination with other drugs, has been used in the treatment of
patients with advanced esophageal cancer, but cisplatin resistance remains a serious clinical challenge (9, 10). In addition to
aberrant p53 expression, negative regulation of p73 could
potentially play a signiﬁcant role in promoting cisplatin resistance. This is of major importance given the fact that the
majority of EACs are deﬁcient or mutant in p53 (11, 12).
The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is a member of the TAM
subfamily that also includes Tyro3 and Mer, and was originally
isolated as a transforming gene from human leukemia cells (13,
14). Elevated AXL expression and interaction with its ligand
Gas6 (growth arrest-speciﬁc 6) have been associated with cell
survival, proliferation, and migration in solid tumors (15–17).
These effects are mediated through activation of the MAPK/
ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways (reviewed by Linger and colleagues, ref. 18). A recent study identiﬁed AXL activation as a novel
mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non–
small cell lung cancer (19, 20). Overexpression of AXL has been
reported in various neoplasms, including melanomas (21),
lung (22), and breast cancers (23). A previous study indicated
that AXL was increasingly upregulated during a multistep

esophageal carcinogenesis and as an adverse prognostic marker in EAC (24).
The primary aim of this report was to study the role of AXL in
mediating CDDP resistance in EAC and identify the molecular
mechanism that regulates this effect. We have uncovered that
the AXL protein is frequently overexpressed in human EAC
primary tumors and cell lines. We also show that AXL suppresses c-ABL/p73 signaling in response to CDDP, thereby
blocking apoptosis and promoting drug resistance in EAC.
These ﬁndings provide evidence that the AXL–c-ABL–p73 axis
might be exploited as a therapeutic target to sensitize tumors
to DNA-damaging drugs in EAC.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
The human esophageal adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines
OE33, OE19, SK-GT-4, and FLO-1 were kindly provided by Dr.
David Beer (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). The JHEsoAd1 cell line was a kind gift from Dr. James Richard
Eshleman (Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD). The cells (OE33,
OE19, SK-GT-4, FLO-1, and JH-EsoAd1) were evaluated
weekly to ascertain conformity to the appropriate in vitro
morphologic characteristics. In addition, the tumorigenicity
of the cells was authenticated by in vivo tumor growth in
female athymic nude-Foxn 1 nu/nu mice (Harlan Laboratories). HEK-293 cells were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection. These cells were maintained in F12
(HAM) medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(GIBCO). The immortalized cell lines originated from normal esophageal squamous epithelia: the HEEC was purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories; and EPC2 was
kindly provided by Dr. Hiroshi Nakagawa (University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). HEEC cells were cultured
in EpiCM-2 medium (ScienCell) supplemented with 5% FBS.
EPC2 cells were grown in keratinocyte serum-free medium
supplemented with 40 mg/mL bovine pituitary extract and 1
ng/mL EGF (Invitrogen). The cell lines (HEK-293, EPC2, and
HEEC) have not been authenticated. All the cells used in this
study were not passaged longer than 6 months after receipt,
and were conﬁrmed free of mycoplasma as determined by
MycoSEQ Mycoplasma Real-Time PCR Detection Kit
(Applied Biosystems). Cisplatin (APP Pharmaceutical) stock
solution (3.3 mmol/L) prepared in sterile water was provided
by the TVC Outpatient Pharmacy, Vanderbilt University
Medical Center, Nashville, TN. Cycloheximide (CHX) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. AXL, PUMA, c-ABL, p-c-ABL
(Y412), cleaved caspase-3 and -9, cleaved PARP, and b-actin
antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.
The p-AXL(Y779) and HDM2 antibodies were purchased
from R&D Systems and Calbiochem, respectively. The p73
antibody was obtained from Bethyl Laboratories. The Lamin

AXL expression and plasmids
The constructs of pcDNA4/AXL-myc-His and pcDNA4
(a gift from Dr. Rosa Marina Melillo, University of Naples,

332

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

Italy; ref. 25) were used to generate stable expression cells.
Brieﬂy, OE33 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). Stably transfected OE33 cells expressing
AXL or vector control (empty pcDNA4) were selected with
100 mg/mL zeocin (Invitrogen) according to standard protocols (26).
The AXL coding sequence from pcDNA3.1/AXL plasmid
was subcloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector (pACCMV).
The recombinant adenovirus-expressing AXL was generated
by cotransfecting HEK-293 cells with the shuttle and backbone adenoviral (pJM17) plasmids using the Calcium Phosphate Transfection kit (Applied Biological Materials). The
pcDNA3/FLAG-p73b and pcDNA3/GFP-c-Abl IV (mouse
type IV) plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Alex Zaika
(Vanderbilt University Medical Center). The pcDNA3-lacZ
plasmid was a gift from Dr. Michael K. Cooper (Vanderbilt
University).
Short hairpin RNA
Lentivirus particles expressing control short hairpin
(shRNA) or a cocktail of 5 different clones of AXL shRNA
were produced and validated by Sigma-Aldrich. FLO-1 cells
that express high levels of endogenous AXL were transduced
with lentivirus particles and selected with 1 mg/mL puromycin
for 10 days.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium
deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 1 Halt
protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 Halt phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). Proteins were separated and
Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (27).
Immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1%
Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce). The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein
Assay. Immunoprecipitations of equal total protein amounts
(200 mg) were conducted at room temperature for 1 hour by
using a primary antibody previously bound to 50 mL Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen). The beads were washed 3 times
with ice-cold PBS. The beads in each tube were heated to
100 C for 5 minutes in 30 mL of 2 sample buffer. The
proteins were then eluted by magnet and subjected to immunoblot analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 27 deidentiﬁed archival cases of esophageal adenocarcinomas, including 7 esophageal normal epithelial tissue samples, were kindly provided by
Dr. Wael El-Rifai (Vanderbilt University Medical Center).
Thereafter, 5 mm of TMA sections were used for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase with
polyclonal goat AXL antibody (1:200; AF154; R&D Systems).
The intensity and frequency of staining were graded as
described previously (28).

AXL Promotes Cisplatin Resistance

Luciferase assay
To investigate the transcriptional activity of p73, we used the
PG13-Luc vector that contains 13-tandem repeats of the p53
consensus DNA binding site. In cells harboring nonfunctional
p53, activated endogenous p73 protein binds to the p53
binding site; therefore, transcription is induced and the reporter gene is expressed (30). OE33 cells stably expressing AXL or
pcDNA4 empty vector and OE19 cells infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing AXL or vector control were seeded
in triplicate in 24-well plates (25  103 per well). The next day,
cells were transiently cotransfected with 200 ng of the PG13Luc and 100 ng of pcDNA3-lacZ plasmid, under the control of
the cytomegalovirus promoter, using Fugene 6 (Promega)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The next day,
cells were treated with CDDP (10 mmol/L) for 48 hours. The

day, cells were treated with 80 mg/mL of CHX and harvested at
different time points. Proteins were analyzed by Western
blotting to evaluate p73b protein stability. Intensities of protein bands were semiquantitatively analyzed by densitometry
using ImageJ software (NIH Image). The intensities of p73b
protein bands for each time point were normalized to their
corresponding b-actin. The protein degradation curves were
generated by plotting relative band intensities as a function of
the time period of CHX treatment. Linear regression was
applied and the protein half-life (t1/2) of p73b, which is
expressed as the time for degradation of 50% of the protein,
was calculated from the ﬁtted line equation (29).

OE19

Apoptosis analysis
Cells (105 per well) were plated in triplicate in 6-well plates
and treated with vehicle or CDDP for 48 hours. Cells were then
harvested and stained with Annexin-V ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI; R&D Systems). The
samples were subjected to ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis by a ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Apoptotic cell death was determined by counting the cells
that stained positive for Annexin-V FITC and negative for PI.

Statistical analysis
The results were expressed as the mean with  SD. The
statistical signiﬁcance of the studies was determined by either
the parametric unpaired Student t test or 2-way ANOVA
followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. Differences with
0.05 are considered signiﬁcant. The difference in AXL protein
expression between normal and EAC tissue samples was
assessed by the Fisher exact test.

Clonogenic survival assay
Cells were plated in triplicate at low density (2  103 per
well) in 6-well plates. The next day, cells were treated with
vehicle or CDDP for 48 hours. Culture media were replaced and
cells were grown for 2 weeks. Cell colonies were then ﬁxed with
2% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.05% crystal violet.
Cell colonies were semiquantitatively analyzed by densitometry using ImageJ software (NIH Image).

luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase reporter
assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The b-galactosidase activity was determined by incubation of cell lysates with the enzyme substrate ONP-b-D-galactopyranoside, and measuring light absorbance at 410 nm.
Fireﬂy luciferase activities were normalized to b-galactosidase
levels.

Cell viability assay
Cells (5  103 per well) were seeded in triplicate onto a 96well plate. The next day, cells were treated with vehicle or

and 7 esophageal normal squamous tissue samples by IHC
staining with anti-AXL speciﬁc antibody. The IHC data showed
that AXL expression was relatively low in normal tissue
samples, as depicted by weak membrane staining predominantly in the lower third of the mucosa (Fig. 1B, left). In
contrast, in some EAC tissue samples, AXL was highly
expressed as indicated by strong cytoplasmic and membrane
staining (Fig. 1B, right). A comprehensive analysis of the IHC
data, whereby IHC index cutoff of 3 was used to indicate
overexpression, revealed that AXL was overexpressed in
51.8% of EAC tumor samples (14/27; Table 1). None of the
tested normal tissue samples exhibited AXL overexpression
(IHC index 2; Table 1). The difference in AXL protein expression between normal tissue samples and EAC was statistically
signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.0068).
AXL enhances cell survival in esophageal
adenocarcinoma
The data on the cell viability assay indicated that reconstitution of AXL expression in OE33 cells signiﬁcantly increased
cell survival relative to control cells in response to 48-hour
treatment with various concentrations of CDDP (P < 0.05; Fig.
2A). In fact, the CDDP IC50 was 45.8 mmol/L in AXL-expressing
cells as opposed to 23.8 mmol/L in control cells (Fig. 2A). To
further conﬁrm the role of AXL in regulating cell survival, we
subjected FLO-1 cells stably expressing AXL shRNA or control
shRNA to the CellTiter cell viability assay after treatment with
various concentrations of CDDP for 48 hours. The results
clearly indicated that knockdown of endogenous AXL significantly sensitized cells to CDDP (P < 0.001; Fig. 2B). In fact, the
CDDP IC50 was 102.2 mmol/L in FLO-1/control shRNA cells,
and 34.1 mmol/L in FLO-1/AXL shRNA cells (Fig. 2B).
To conﬁrm the short-term survival assay data, we subjected OE33 cells stably expressing AXL or empty vector, and
FLO-1 cells stably expressing AXL shRNA or control shRNA to
long-term clonogenic survival assay. The data indicated that
the reconstitution of AXL expression in OE33 cells enhanced
cell survival by 3-fold relative to control (P < 0.01) in response
to CDDP (Fig. 2C). Conversely, knockdown of endogenous
AXL in FLO-1 cells decreased cell survival by approximately
2-fold relative to control (P ¼ 0.01) in response to CDDP
(Fig. 2D).

AXL suppresses DNA damage-induced apoptosis and
activation of caspases
The data on Annexin V/PI staining and FACS analysis
indicated that the reconstitution of AXL expression in OE33
cells inhibited early apoptosis events by 25% relative to control
in response to CDDP (P ¼ 0.014; Fig. 3A). In line with this
result, Western blot analysis indicated signiﬁcantly higher
protein levels of cleaved forms of caspase-9 and -3, and PARP
in control cells than AXL-expressing cells after treatment
with CDDP (Fig. 3B). In contrast, knockdown of endogenous
AXL in FLO-1 cells increased early apoptosis by 73.5% relative to control (P < 0.01) in response to CDDP (Fig. 3C).
Accordingly, Western blot analysis results showed that knockdown of endogenous AXL signiﬁcantly increased protein levels
of cleaved forms of caspase-9 and -3 and PARP relative to
control in response to CDDP (Fig. 3D).
AXL blocks DNA-damage-induced activation and nuclear
accumulation of p73 and decreases p73 protein stability
To examine if AXL expression has an effect on DNA-damageinduced activation of p73, we used OE33 and OE19 cell models.
Data from Western blot analysis indicated that the level of
endogenous p73b protein was signiﬁcantly higher in control
cells than AXL-expressing cells in response to CDDP (Fig. 4A
and 4B). Accordingly, protein expression of p73 downstream
transcriptional targets PUMA and HDM2 was signiﬁcantly
induced by CDDP in control cells but not in AXL-expressing
cells (Fig. 4A and B). Consistent with these data, qRT-PCR
analysis showed that relative mRNA expression of PUMA and
HDM2 were 3.5- and 2-fold higher in control cells than AXLexpressing cells, respectively, in response to CDDP (Supplementary Fig. S1). To conﬁrm the role of AXL in regulating p73
transcriptional activity, we conducted the luciferase reporter
assay using pG13-luc plasmid. In OE33 cells, luciferase activity
was 54.7% higher in control cells than AXL-expressing cells
(P ¼ 0.005) after treatment with CDDP (Fig. 4C). Similarly, in
OE19 cells, the luciferase activity was 81.1% higher in control
cells than AXL-expressing cells (P ¼ 0.01) in response to
CDDP (Fig. 4D). Western blot analysis of cytosolic and nuclear
protein fractions unequivocally conﬁrmed CDDP-induced accumulation of p73b protein in the nucleus in OE33 control cells
(Fig. 4E). Conversely, CDDP treatment had no effect on p73b
level or localization in AXL-expressing OE33 cells (Fig. 4E).
On the basis of our ﬁnding that AXL suppressed CDDPinduced activation of p73b, we hypothesized that AXL could
potentially regulate p73b protein stability. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the protein stability of exogenous p73b
transiently expressed in OE33/AXL or OE33/pcDNA4 stable
cells by Western blot analysis after treatment with CHX.
Indeed, the data on protein degradation indicated that AXL
signiﬁcantly reduced the protein t1/2 of p73b from 11.4 to 6.5
hours relative to control (Fig. 4F).
AXL attenuates DNA-damage-induced phosphorylation
of c-ABL and disrupts c-ABL/p73 protein association
Because the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-ABL is the primary regulator of p73 in response to DNA damage, we postulated that AXL could negatively regulate c-ABL, thereby inhibiting

p73 activation. Data from Western blot analysis indicated that
CDDP treatment signiﬁcantly increased p-c-ABL(Y412) and pp73b(Y99) in OE33/pcDNA4 cells. Conversely, AXL expression
substantially attenuated CDDP-induced phosphorylation of cABL and p73b proteins in OE33/AXL cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly,
the basal levels of c-ABL and p73b proteins were higher in AXLexpressing cells than control cells (Fig. 5A). We next examined if
AXL interferes with c-ABL binding to p73b in OE33 cells.
Immunoprecipitation and data from Western blot indicated
that endogenous c-ABL bound to exogenous p73b protein as
expected. However, the reconstitution of AXL expression signiﬁcantly disrupted the c-ABL/p73b protein complex (Fig. 5B).
To conﬁrm that AXL blocked CDDP-induced apoptosis through
regulation of c-ABL, we veriﬁed whether AXL could directly
suppress c-ABL–induced cell death. The data from the cell
viability assay showed that transient expression of c-ABL in
OE33 cells induced approximately 40% less cell survival relative
to control cells (P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 5C). On the other hand, expression

of AXL in combination with c-ABL completely restored survival
to the level of control cells (Fig. 5C). Data from Western blot
analysis conﬁrmed protein expression of c-ABL alone or in
combination with AXL in OE33 cells (Fig. 5D).
AXL associates with c-ABL protein and prevents DNAdamage-induced accumulation of c-ABL in the nucleus
On the basis of our results showing that AXL interfered with
c-ABL binding to p73 and blocked phosphorylation of c-ABL,
we hypothesized that AXL could interact with c-ABL forming a
protein complex that prevents accumulation of c-ABL in the
nucleus and its interaction with p73 in response to DNA
damage. To test this hypothesis, we conducted immunoprecipitation with the AXL antibody followed by Western blot
analysis of AXL and c-ABL proteins in OE33 and HEK-293 cells.
The data showed protein association of exogenous AXL with
endogenous c-ABL in OE33 cells (Fig. 6A), or with exogenous cABL in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 6B). We next treated OE33 cells

Figure 3. AXL expression inhibits CDDP-induced apoptosis. A, apoptosis in OE33 cells stably expressing AXL or empty vector after treatment with vehicle or
CDDP (5 mmol/L) for 48 hours was determined by Annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and FACS analysis. Quantitative data (right) showed signiﬁcantly
less apoptosis in AXL-expressing cells than control cells (P ¼ 0.014) in response to CDDP. B, Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase-3 and -9, cleaved

stably expressing AXL or pcDNA4 with vehicle or CDDP (10
mmol/L) for 48 hours, and subjected the cytosolic and nuclear
protein fractions to Western blot analysis of c-ABL and AXL
proteins. The results clearly indicated that cytosolic c-ABL
signiﬁcantly decreased in response to CDDP in control cells,
but AXL expression counteracted this effect (Fig. 6C). Overall,
the protein level of cytosolic c-ABL was signiﬁcantly higher in
AXL-expressing cells than control cells. Conversely, the nuclear
c-ABL protein expression level was higher in control cells than
AXL-expressing cells (Fig. 6C). In addition, the data showed
that AXL protein expression was limited to the cytosolic
fraction (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that AXL sequesters c-ABL in the cytosol and prevents
targeting of c-ABL to the nucleus in response to DNA damage.

Discussion
Although the DNA-damaging agent CDDP alone or in combination with other drugs has been used as a ﬁrst-line therapy

336

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

in patients with advanced esophageal cancer, resistance to
CDDP, unfortunately, remains a major clinical problem (9, 10).
Identiﬁcation of the mechanisms that control resistance to
CDDP is essential to predicting response to therapy, and to
developing new drugs that can overcome resistance. On the
basis of the fact that AXL was implicated in promoting cell
survival and proliferation through activation of downstream
growth and survival pathways in various cancers (15, 18), we
evaluated AXL protein expression and examined its role in
CDDP resistance in EAC.
In this study, we showed frequent overexpression of the AXL
protein in EAC primary tumors (51.8%) and that AXL was
exclusively expressed in EAC cell lines, but not in normal
esophageal squamous cell lines. Our results clearly indicated
that reconstitution of AXL expression enhanced survival and
attenuated apoptosis after treatment with CDDP. Conversely,
knockdown of endogenous AXL sensitized cells to CDDP. Our
ﬁndings strongly indicate that AXL promotes resistance to
CDDP in EAC cells.

CDDP induces DNA damage causing apoptosis through
activation of the tumor suppressor p53 protein (6). However,
CDDP can also induce apoptosis in p53-deﬁcient cells
through activation of the p73 protein, a member of the p53
family (6). This is particularly of major importance, given the
majority of EACs are deﬁcient or mutant in p53 (11). To
identify the mechanism by which AXL mediates resistance to
CDDP, we hypothesized that AXL could block activation of
p73 in response to CDDP in EAC cells. Indeed, our data
showed that the reconstitution of AXL expression signiﬁcantly attenuated CDDP-induced transcriptional activation of
endogenous p73b as conﬁrmed by decreased levels of
p73b, PUMA, and HDM2 proteins, and PG13-luc luciferase
activity. Interestingly, AXL expression increased the basal

with CDDP increased levels of p73b,

these effects were abrogated by
AXL. C and D, the pG13 luciferase

endogenous p73b protein level, albeit blocking CDDP-induced
activation of p73b. This suggests that the reconstitution of
AXL oncoprotein expression in our p53-deﬁcient EAC cells
could decrease the rate of growth or induce some apoptosis
through activation of p73. Consistent with this observation,
our results indicated signiﬁcantly less colony formation (Fig.
2C) and more apoptosis (Fig. 3A) in vehicle-treated AXLexpressing cells than control cells. A previous report showed
that endogenous p73a and p73b proteins were upregulated in
p53-deﬁcient cancer cells in response to oncogenes (30).
Additional studies will be required to fully determine the
mechanism by which AXL regulates endogenous p73 basal
expression independent of stress signals. As the protein
stability of p73 was shown to be enhanced by CDDP (6), we

postulated that AXL could destabilize p73 protein, thereby
blocking its activation in response to DNA damage. Indeed,
we showed that AXL expression signiﬁcantly decreased the
somewhat stable exogenous p73b protein t1/2 from 11.4 to 6.5
hours.
Several studies indicated that the functional nonreceptor
tyrosine kinase, c-ABL, is required for CDDP-induced upregulation of p73 protein stability, because activated c-ABL
binds through its SH3 domain to the carboxy-terminal
homo-oligomerization domain of p73 and phosphorylates
it on a tyrosine residue at position 99 in response to DNA
damage (6, 8, 31). We conﬁrmed that AXL blocked CDDPinduced phosphorylation of c-ABL and p73b proteins, and
showed that AXL expression disrupted c-ABL/p73b protein
association. Accordingly, our data showed that AXL significantly attenuated c-ABL-induced cell death, strongly suggesting that AXL regulation of p73 is mediated by c-ABL. The
c-ABL localization is controlled by 3 nuclear localization
signals (NLS) and 1 nuclear export signal (NES) that are
responsible for shuttling of c-ABL between the cytoplasm
and nucleus (32). It has been shown that nuclear c-ABL
relays proapoptotic signals from ATM to p53 and p73 in
response to DNA damage (8, 33). Another study indicated
that c-ABL increases p73 protein levels in the nucleus in a
kinase-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of p73 (Y99)
promotes tight interaction with the SH2 domain of c-ABL
that may enhance p73 protein stability (34). On the basis of

OE33 cells stably expressing AXL
or pcDNA4 were treated with

indicate that CDDP treatment
signiﬁcantly increased levels of pc-ABL(Y412), p-p73b(Y99), and
p73b proteins in control cells. In
contrast, AXL expression
abrogated these effects in
response to CDDP. B,

antibody in OE33 cells transfected

p73b interacted with endogenous
c-ABL protein, and the p73b/cABL protein complex was
disrupted by AXL. C, cell viability of
OE33 cells transfected with
pcDNA4 alone, AXL alone or in
combination with GFP-c-ABL was
assessed 48 hours posttransfection. AXL expression
blocked c-ABL-induced cell death.
D, Western blot analysis of c-ABL
and AXL proteins in OE33 cells

these studies and our ﬁndings, we postulated that AXL
interacts with cytosolic c-ABL, thereby blocking nuclear
accumulation of c-ABL in the apoptotic response to DNA
damage. Our results clearly showed protein association
between AXL and either exogenous or endogenous c-ABL,
although we did not conﬁrm direct binding of AXL to c-ABL.
Furthermore, we showed that AXL blocked nuclear accumulation of c-ABL protein in response to DNA damage, thus
disrupting the apoptotic signaling cascade. In a similar
study, Raina and colleagues (35) indicated that the MUC1
transmembrane glycoprotein sequesters c-ABL in the cytoplasm and thereby attenuates apoptosis in response to DNA
damage mediated by anticancer agents. Interestingly, our
data showed that AXL dramatically increased the basal
protein expression level of c-ABL in the cytosol independent
of DNA damage response. Further studies will be necessary
to elucidate the mechanism by which AXL regulates cytosolic c-ABL expression, and investigate its functional implication.
In conclusion, our results indicate that frequent overexpression of AXL in EAC underlies a CDDP resistance phenotype. We
show that AXL expression inhibits c-ABL/p73 signaling in
response to DNA damage, thus blocking apoptosis and mediating drug resistance in EAC. Therefore, our ﬁndings provide
evidence that the AXL–c-ABL–p73 axis could be exploited as a
therapeutic target to sensitize tumors to DNA-damaging drugs
in EAC.
