Abstract
Despite studies that show the antitumor activity of Hsp90
inhibitors, such as geldanamycin (GA) and its derivative
17-allylamino-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), recent
reports indicate that these inhibitors lack significant singleagent clinical activity. Resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors has been
previously linked to expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and
the multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype. However, the stress
response induced by GA treatment can also cause resistance to
Hsp90-targeted therapy. Therefore, we chose to further
investigate the relative importance of P-gp and the stress
response in 17-AAG resistance. Colony-forming assays revealed
that high expression of P-gp could increase the 17-AAG IC50
6-fold in cells transfected with P-gp compared with parent
cells. A549 cells selected for resistance to GA overexpressed
P-gp, but verapamil did not reverse the resistance. These cells
also overexpressed Hsp27, and Hsp70 was induced with 17-AAG
treatment. When the GA and 17-AAG resistant cells were
transfected with Hsp27 and/or Hsp70 small interfering RNA
(siRNA), the 17-AAG IC50 decreased 10-fold compared with
control transfected cells. Transfection with siRNA directed
against Hsp27, Hsp70, or Hsp27 and Hsp70 also increased
sensitivity to EC78, a purine scaffold-based Hsp90 inhibitor
that is not a P-gp substrate. We conclude that P-gp may
contribute, in part, to resistance to 17-AAG, but induction
of stress response proteins, such as Hsp27 and Hsp70, by
Hsp90-targeted therapy plays a larger role. Taken together,
our results indicate that targeting of Hsp27 and Hsp70 should
be exploited to increase the clinical efficacy of Hsp90-directed
therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7419–27]

Introduction
Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are a family of molecular chaperone
proteins important in folding newly synthesized polypeptides,
stabilization and refolding of proteins during stress, and protein
trafficking. Hsp90 is a core component of a multimolecular
chaperone complex that includes many other chaperone and
cochaperone proteins (1). Client proteins of this chaperone
complex include transcription factors, tyrosine kinases, serine/
threonine kinases, and other oncogenes (2). By controlled binding
and release of these client proteins, the Hsp90 chaperone complex
plays a regulatory role in cellular protein fates.

The Hsp90 chaperone machinery is dependent on ATP binding
to fulfill its chaperone function (3, 4). Geldanamycin (GA) has
been shown by crytallographic (5) and biochemical analyses
(6, 7) to bind the Hsp90 ATP/ADP-binding domain, constraining
the chaperone in its ADP-bound conformation and inhibiting
its folding, trafficking, and stabilization functions (8). In this
ADP-bound conformation, multiple kinases and other proteins
in critical signal transduction pathways are degraded by the
proteasome in response to GA treatment (9). Concomitantly,
binding of Hsp90 inhibitors also induces a stress response
through the release and activation of heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1;
refs. 10, 11), a transcription factor that binds heat shock elements
(HSE) within promoters of stress-responsive genes, such as Hsp70
and Hsp27, resulting in increased transcription and translation of
these genes (12). Whereas GA has shown effective preclinical
activity (13–15), observed hepatotoxicity limited its clinical
development (16). However, an analogue of GA, 17-allylaminodemethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), has shown a favorable toxicologic profile, and several formulations of 17-AAG have
completed phase 1 testing; phase 2 trials for 17-AAG are currently
under way (17, 18). Because 17-AAG is not water soluble, unstable
in solution, and not orally bioavailable, other Hsp90 inhibitors are
being developed for clinical use. Currently, the orally bioavailable
GA analogue 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG; ref. 19), as well as purine and pyrazole scaffoldbased Hsp90-targeted agents, which also possess favorable
characteristics, are also under development for future clinical
application (20–22).
Unfortunately, data from many 17-AAG phase 1 studies indicate
that, as a single agent, 17-AAG has not resulted in the predicted
significant clinical activity. These data have raised the question of
targeting mechanisms of intrinsic 17-AAG resistance to increase
clinical response. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a member of the ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporter family encoded by the gene
MDR1 and previously implicated in the multidrug resistance
(MDR) phenotype (23), acts as an efflux pump for many common
anticancer agents and ansamycin benzoquinones, such as GA and
17-AAG (24). MDR1 gene amplification in cells selected for
resistance to P-gp substrates has been frequently described (25).
However, it is notable that increased transcription of MDR1 after
cell stress has been related to transcriptional activation at the
identified HSE in the promoter region (26, 27). The potential
contribution of an HSF-1–mediated stress response to 17-AAG
clinical resistance has been posited by several groups (12, 28). In
agreement with this premise, Hsp70 down-regulation was recently
shown to sensitize cells to 17-AAG–induced apoptosis (29, 30).
Subsequently, we identified the role of Hsp27 and glutathione in
Hsp90 inhibitor resistance (31). This connection between the
transcriptional activation of P-gp and stress-induced proteins, such
as Hsp27 and Hsp70, through HSF-1 binding of HSEs prompted us

to assess the relative contribution of these proteins to Hsp90targeted therapy resistance.
In this study, we have confirmed that P-gp expression affects
sensitivity to 17-AAG, although it does not prevent cells from
up-regulating stress response proteins. We also show that GA
analogues cause acute up-regulation of P-gp. In cells with acquired
resistance to 17-AAG, we found that P-gp was possibly overexpressed due to a chromosomal duplication event. Whereas P-gp
may contribute, at least in part, to 17-AAG resistance, our data
indicate that Hsp27 and Hsp70 induction plays a much larger role.
Knockdown of either Hsp27 or Hsp70 was sufficient to increase
sensitivity to 17-AAG by as much as 10-fold and renders 17-AAG–
resistant cells more sensitive to EC78, a purine-scaffold Hsp90
inhibitor that is not a P-gp substrate. Collectively, these results
indicate that targeting stress-responsive proteins, such as Hsp70
and Hsp27, will be important for preventing resistance to current
and future generations of Hsp90 inhibitors.

Amersham Pharmacia Biotechnology; daunorubicin and verapamil (VP)
from Sigma.
Antibodies. H9010 and JJ3 mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing
Hsp90 and p23, respectively, were previously described (32, 33). The
remaining antibodies were purchased from the following suppliers:
peroxidase-coupled affinity-purified goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rat, and
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies from Kirkegaard & Perry; mouse

Cell culture. MCF-7, MCF-7/ADRR (34), A549, and A549 cells selected for
GA resistance (A549GARS), created as described previously (31), were
cultured in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). KB3-1 and KB-T10
cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS; 10 ng/mL colchicine
was added to KB-T10 medium. MDA-MB-231/empty vector and MDA-MB231/BCRP cells (35) were cultured in modified IMEM with 10% FBS. G418
(400 Ag/AL) was added to MDA-MB-231/BCRP medium. All cells were
supplemented with 2 mmol/L glutamine, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and
100 units/mL penicillin.
Transfections. A549GARS cells were transfected with small interfering
RNA (siRNA), as previously described (31). Briefly, cells were plated in sixwell plates at a density of 5  105 per well and allowed to adhere for 20 to
24 h. Control siRNA #1 (400 nmol), Hsp70-specific siRNA, and/or Hsp27specific siRNA (Dharmacon; ref. 31) were complexed with 10 AL of
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 0.5 mL Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 10 min.
Cells were then incubated for 4 h with complexed lipid-siRNA, after which
1 mL of Opti-MEM containing 35% FBS was added. On the next day,
cultures were washed once with serum-free medium, and fresh medium was
added. Cells were trypsinized and replated for clonogenic assays or
immunoblotting the next day, as described below. For MCF-7/ADRR cells,
wells were coated with 5 AL of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX, 500 AL Opti-MEM,
and 100 pmol siRNA. 1  105 cells in 2.5-mL medium was added to the well
and incubated for 48 h before trypsinization.
Clonogenic assays. A549, A549GARS, KB3-1, KB-T10, or MCF-7/ADRR
cells were trypsinized and plated in 60-mm tissue culture plates to a density
of 1,500, 1,500, 1,000, 1,000, and 1,000 cells per plate, respectively. Cells were
allowed to adhere for 22 to 24 h, and then drugs were added, as indicated, to
final concentrations from 100-fold concentrated stocks. After 24-h incubation, plates were washed twice with serum-free medium, then fresh medium
was added, and cells were incubated until colonies were visible. The plates
were washed once with PBS and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.
Visible colonies were counted with 250 to 400, 250 to 300, 250 to 300, 250 to
300, and 150 to 200 colonies typical, respectively.
Immunoblotting. Cells were plated on 100-mm dishes, allowed to
adhere for 22 to 24 h, and then treated as described. Cells were lifted from
plates by scraping, pelleted at 250  g for 5 min at 4jC, rinsed once with
ice-cold PBS, and then lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mmol/L HEPES

expression of mRNA for P-gp, BCRP,

(GARS ) cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and probed by Western blotting. D, FISH
analysis was performed on A549 and
A549GARS cells with representative
metaphase cells shown. A centromere 7

(pH 7.4), 20 mmol/L sodium molybdate, 150 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors
(complete, mini, EDTA-free, tablets; Roche). After 10-min incubation on ice,
the detergent insoluble fractions were pelleted at 18,000  g for 2 min at
4jC. Total protein concentration of supernatants was estimated by the
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (31). For P-gp samples, cells were plated
in 75-mm flasks, allowed to adhere for 22 to 24 h, and then treated as
described. Adherent cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested
by scraping after adding 500 AL of 4 SDS sample buffer to flask, and then
sonicated. Total protein concentration was estimated by the BCA method
(31). To prepare samples for SDS-PAGE, 1/10 volume DTT was added to a
final concentration of 100 mmol/L and then samples were boiled for 15 min.
For all Western blots, samples containing 50 to 150 Ag of total protein were
separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel. The
separated polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with
antibodies, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence as previously
described (31).
Immunoprecipitation. p23 immunoprecipitations were performed as
follows: JJ3 antibody was rotated with Protein A Sepharose beads for 1 h at
room temperature, washed thrice with 0.1 mol/L potassium phosphate
(pH 8.0), washed once in cold lysis buffer, and then resuspended in one
volume of lysis buffer to form antibody-bead slurry. One milligram of bead
slurry-precleared protein was added to 50 AL of antibody-bead slurry and
rotated overnight at 4jC. Antibody complexes were washed thrice with lysis
buffer, then resuspended in one volume of 2 SDS sample buffer. Protein
binding to p23 was determined by separating immunoprecipitations by
SDS-PAGE, and then Western blotting for proteins was indicated.
Microarray analysis. RNA was prepared from parent and resistant A549
cells using the RNeasy Total RNA Isolation kit (QIAGEN). RNA quality
assessment, probe labeling, and hybridization to the Affymetrix U133 plus

2.0 Human Genome Array Chip were performed by the Mayo Clinic Cancer
Center Microarray Shared Resource. In the preliminary analysis, one array
was hybridized to a sample of parent A549 and another array was
hybridized to a sample of resistant A549 cells. The samples were analyzed in
duplicate using chips from the same lot. These arrays were normalized
using fastlo normalization (36). Gene expression values were generated
from the perfect match probes of the corresponding probeset using a mixed
linear model similar to that described by Chu and colleagues (37). An MvA
plot was used to determine the number of genes that were statistically,
significantly, and substantially, in fold-change magnitude, altered between
the parent and resistant cells.
17-AAG retention. Exponentially growing parent or A549GARS cells were
treated with 217 nmol/L [3H]17-AAG for 1 h at 37jC. After washing with PBS,
drug-free medium was added to the cells, which were harvested immediately
(0 h), or incubated for an additional 4 h at 37jC. To harvest, cells were
washed thrice with room temperature 1 PBS, twice with ice-cold 1 PBS,
and then resuspended in about four volumes of buffer {10 mmol/L
Tris, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 7.5) plus protease inhibitors: 0.1 mmol/L
leupeptin, 0.1 mg/mL bacitracin, 77 Ag/mL aprotinin, 1.5 Amol/L pepstatin,
and 1 mmol/L AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfanyl fluoride]} and lysed
by brief sonication. Radioactivity from the cell lysates was measured using a
liquid scintillation counter. Excess unlabeled GA was used to saturate
specific binding before treatment in background control flasks.
Florescence in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) was performed as previously described (38). Briefly, dual-probe FISH
analyses were performed on slides containing cell lines that were prepared
according to established procedures in the Mayo Cytogenetics Shared
Resource. A locus-specific probe was designed for MDR1 (red) and paired
with a centromere probe for chromosome 7 (green). Metaphase nuclei were
analyzed for both A549 and A549GARS cells.

Statistical analysis. Identification of genes with statistically significant
(P < 0.05) different expression between the groups was done with a mixed
linear model; the independent variables in the model were the probe values
and a group status (e.g., parental versus resistant cells). Genes were ranked
by smallest to largest P value. Because this was an exploratory analysis
(versus a confirmatory analysis), no correction was made for multiple
comparisons.

Results
P-gp expression can affect sensitivity to 17-AAG. Previous
studies have shown that P-gp in tumor cells may participate in the
efflux of Hsp90-directed agents, such as 17-AAG (39). To test P-gp
influence on 17-AAG sensitivity, we performed clonogenic assays
on KB3-1 cells, a human epidermoid carcinoma, and KB-T10 cells, a
colchicine-resistant KB3-1 variant that overexpresses P-gp (23), but
not Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp27 (Fig. 1A). As predicted, expression of
P-gp increased resistance to 17-AAG; the IC50 for KB3-1 parent cells
was 36 F 16 nmol/L, whereas the IC50 in the P-gp–expressing KBT10 line was 218 F 43 nmol/L (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that
high basal P-gp expression can contribute to 17-AAG resistance.
To examine possible mechanisms for the observed increase in
17-AAG IC50 in cells expressing P-gp, we chose to assess the
function of Hsp90 in these cells. Hsp90 activity was monitored by
examining its binding to p23, a cochaperone that binds Hsp90 only
in the presence of ATP (40). By immunoprecipitating p23, then
determining Hsp90 binding by Western blotting, we assessed
whether Hsp90 is in an ATP-bound conformation. Because Johnson
and colleagues previously showed that p23 binding to Hsp90 is

disrupted by 17-AAG treatment (33), we hypothesized that Hsp90p23 binding would be less affected in cells overexpressing P-gp
than in nontransfected cells due to efflux of 17-AAG. To isolate the
contribution of P-gp, we included cells treated with VP, a known
inhibitor of P-gp. KB3-1 and KB-T10 cells were treated with vehicle
(DMSO), 100 nmol/L 17-AAG, 5 Amol/L VP, or both 17-AAG and VP
simultaneously for 24 h. Immunoprecipitation of p23 showed that
17-AAG was able to completely abolish Hsp90 binding to p23 in the
KB3-1 cells compared with DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 5
and 3, respectively), indicating that Hsp90 function was disrupted.
However, in KB-T10 cells that overexpress P-gp, Hsp90-p23 binding
was not disrupted to the same extent as in KB3-1 cells with 17-AAG
treatment (lane 9). The lack of Hsp90 inhibition likely results from
the KB-T10 cells effluxing 17-AAG, thereby resulting in lower
intracellular concentrations than are found in the KB3-1 cell line.
Addition of VP restored 17-AAG–mediated disruption of Hsp90 in
KB-T10 cells (lane 10), indicating that P-gp expression alone can
cause resistance to 17-AAG–mediated disruption of Hsp90.
Because stress response proteins, such as Hsp70 are dramatically
up-regulated in response to Hsp90-directed agents (12), we
examined immunoblots of the lysates used for the p23 immunoprecipitation to assess Hsp70 expression after treatment with
17-AAG. Our data revealed that Hsp70 was up-regulated in response
to 17-AAG in both KB3-1 cells and KB-T10 cells, both with and
without VP treatment, indicating that 17-AAG stimulates the stress
response in both cell types independently of P-gp function (Fig. 1D).
From these data, we conclude that, whereas P-gp expression may
increase the 17-AAG IC50 in cells, up-regulation of heat shock

Hsp27 and Hsp70 Affect Resistance to Hsp90-Directed Therapy

proteins indicates that some 17-AAG is still able to enter these cells
and disrupt Hsp90 activity.
P-gp is up-regulated in GA-resistant cells. Because P-gp is
known to contain an HSE and its production is stimulated by heat
shock (26), we hypothesized that Hsp90 inhibitor treatment would
cause up-regulation of P-gp. To examine this question, we treated
A549 cells with 1 Amol/L GA, 1 Amol/L 17-AAG, or 1 Amol/L
17-DMAG for 24 or 48 hours. Western analysis revealed that all
three Hsp90 inhibitors caused up-regulation of P-gp at both 24 and
48 hours (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5 and 6–8, respectively), indicating that
treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors could result in P-gp–mediated
resistance to those and other drugs.
To further assess the role of P-gp in Hsp90 inhibitor-induced
resistance, we created a cell line derived from parent A549 cells that
is highly resistant to GA and 17-AAG. Resistant cells (A549GARS)
were selected by growing A549 cells in the presence of increasing
concentrations of GA, until the cells were determined to be stably
resistant in drug-free medium with a 10-fold increase in GA IC50
in comparison with A549 parent cells in a clonogenic assay (31).
Using microarray technology, we compared differences in gene
expression between A549 and A549GARS cells and found that
increased gene expression for MDR1 in A549GARS (Fig. 2B) was
correlated with increased protein expression by Western blotting
(Fig. 2C). Interestingly, we did not observe significant differences
between A549 and A549GARS cells in either mRNA or protein
expression for Hsp90, BCRP, or the stress-inducible isoform of
Hsp70, although Hsp27 protein expression was slightly increased.
Supplementary Table S1 includes the 20 genes with the greatest
mean difference (either increased or decreased) identified by
differential expression analysis and ranked according to P value.
However, the P values are not corrected for multiple tests and used
as ranking and hypothesis generation tools only.
To further investigate possible mechanisms of MDR1 gene upregulation in A549GARS, we chose to perform FISH analysis to
compare A549 and A549GARS chromosomal differences because
MDR1 is often duplicated or amplified in cells that develop
resistance to various chemotherapeutics (25). In Fig. 2D, A549
cells are shown to have three full copies of chromosome 7 (green)
but no evidence of duplication or amplification of MDR1 (red).
However, A549GARS metaphase nuclei revealed that these cells
have an extra iso(7q) chromosome resulting in an increased copy
number for MDR1, although there was no evidence of amplification of MDR1 on 7q21.1 (Fig. 2D). This chromosomal abnormality
may explain the increased expression of P-gp in these GA-resistant
cells observed at the levels of both mRNA and protein expression
(Fig. 2B and C).
In an attempt to determine if P-gp expression was causing
decreased retention of 17-AAG in A549GARS cells, we loaded cells
with [3H]17-AAG and then washed with drug-free medium and
allowed 17-AAG to efflux over 4 hours into drug-free medium. The
amount of [3H]17-AAG remaining in the cells was used as an
indirect measure of drug efflux. Our data show that A549GARS had
less initial drug uptake than A549 cells (Fig. 3A, black columns) and
retained proportionally less 17-AAG after 4 hours than A549 cells
(white columns), consistent with A549GARS cells effluxing more
drug than A549 cells. We used a 100-fold excess of unlabeled GA as
a control for nonspecific binding (middle columns). These data
show that A549 cells take up and retain more 17-AAG at 4 hours
than A549GARS. Experiments using flow cytometry to measure the
retention of daunorubicin provide additional evidence of P-gp
efflux in A549GARS (Supplementary Fig. S1).

1 Amol/L 17-AAG (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) for 24 h. Western blotting was
performed using 50 Ag of cell lysates harvested after treatment and separated
by SDS-PAGE.

P-gp inhibition does not affect 17-AAG IC50 in GA-resistant
cells. 17-AAG has been identified as both a substrate and inhibitor
of P-gp activity (41, 42). However, it remains unclear whether P-gp
activity directly affects cellular sensitivity in cells that have acquired
resistance to 17-AAG, such as A549GARS. Clonogenic assays
revealed that the IC50 of A549GARS cells was not significantly
different for 17-AAG combined with VP (1048 F 121 nmol/L) versus
17-AAG alone (957 F 123 nmol/L; Fig. 3B). This suggests that P-gp
does not play a major role in the resistance to 17-AAG observed
in A549GARS cells. Additionally, overexpression of BCRP in MDAMB-231 cells, another drug efflux pump, failed to increase 17-AAG
resistance (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To confirm that P-gp is not inhibiting 17-AAG disruption of
Hsp90 activity, we performed a p23 immunoprecipitation in A549
and A549GARS cells after treatment. Cells were treated with vehicle
(DMSO), 100 nmol/L 17-AAG, 5 Amol/L VP, or both 17-AAG and VP
simultaneously, then Hsp90 binding to p23 was determined.
Western analysis revealed that, whereas VP alone had no effect
on Hsp90 binding to p23 (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 8), this binding was
disrupted in both cell lines with 17-AAG treatment alone or in
combination with VP (lanes 5 and 9 and 6 and 10, respectively;
Fig. 3C). This is unlike KB-T10 cells, in which VP enhanced 17-AAG
disruption of Hsp90-p23 binding (Fig. 1C, lane 10). Importantly,

we observed no difference in p23 binding between the A549 parent
cell line and the GA-resistant A549GARS. We conclude that P-gp is
unlikely to contribute significantly to the 17-AAG resistance
observed in A549GARS cells. Interestingly, A549 and A549GARS
cells both up-regulated Hsp70 in response to 17-AAG treatment
independently of VP treatment, consistent with induction of a
stress response in these cells, despite P-gp expression (Fig. 3D).
This raises the possibility that proteins induced during the cellular
stress response mediate resistance to 17-AAG.
Knockdown of stress proteins Hsp27 or Hsp70 in GAresistant cells increases sensitivity to 17-AAG. Previously, we
showed that Hsp27 contributes to 17-AAG resistance through a
glutathione-mediated mechanism (31). We also found that the
effect of knockdown of Hsp27 alone or combined knockdown of
Hsp27 and Hsp70 does not offer any advantage over knockdown of
Hsp70 alone in cells that have not been selected for GA resistance.
However, A549GARS cells have higher expression of Hsp27 than
parent A549 cells (Fig. 2C) and may be more dependent on Hsp27
expression for survival after 17-AAG treatment. Consequently, we
chose to examine the effect of Hsp27 and Hsp70 expression on
17-AAG cytotoxicity in A549GARS cells. Simultaneous knockdown
of Hsp27 and Hsp70 with siRNA resulted in a similar IC50 as
knockdown of Hsp27 or Hsp70 alone (Fig. 4A; 228 F 22, 235 F 42,
and 179 F 67, respectively; control siRNA had an IC50 of 816 F
89 nmol/L). Western blotting was performed to confirm siRNA
efficacy (Fig. 4B). The similar effect of knocking down Hsp27 or
Hsp70 is in striking contrast to our previous finding that Hsp27
seemed less critical than Hsp70 for survival in cells not selected for
GA resistance. These data are consistent with cells chronically

exposed to 17-AAG, developing resistance through up-regulation of
stress-responsive proteins, particularly Hsp27.
Inhibition of P-gp function does not increase sensitivity to
17-AAG when added to knockdown of stress response proteins.
To test the possibility that P-gp may cause additive resistance that
is masked by Hsp27 overexpression in A549GARS cells, we
performed clonogenic assays with cells that were transfected with
Hsp27 siRNA and then treated with 17-AAG or 17-AAG and VP
simultaneously. Treatment with VP did not cause a significant
change in the IC50 for 17-AAG in cells with decreased levels of
Hsp27 compared with 17-AAG alone (IC50 of 283 F 66 and 276 F
48 nmol/L, respectively; Fig. 5A), further indicating that P-gp
activity is not necessary for A549GARS resistance to Hsp90
inhibitors. Western blotting confirmed that cells transfected with
Hsp27-directed siRNA have dramatically decreased Hsp27 compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 5B). However,
knockdown of Hsp27 did not affect down-regulation of Hsp90
client protein Akt after 17-AAG treatment.
To further assess the role of Hsp27 in resistance to 17-AAG in
cells which overexpress P-gp, Hsp27 was knocked down in MCF-7
cells that have a high expression of P-gp due to acquired resistance
to Adriamycin (MCF-7/ADRR; ref. 34), which are also resistant to
GA (39, 43). The IC50 for 17-AAG was 1,080 F 134 nmol/L in cells
that were transfected with Hsp27 siRNA compared with 2,760 F
155 nmol/L for control siRNA (Fig. 5C). Whereas VP treatment
was more sensitizing to 17-AAG than Hsp27 siRNA, combining
Hsp27 knockdown and VP treatment in these cells resulted in a
small additive effect (IC50 of 429 F 121, 1,080 F 134, and 255 F
112 nmol/L, respectively; Fig. 5C). Western blotting confirmed that

Hsp27 and Hsp70 Affect Resistance to Hsp90-Directed Therapy

Hsp27 was knocked down after transfection with Hsp27-targeted
siRNA (Fig. 5D).
Knockdown of Hsp27 or Hsp70 increases sensitivity to EC78.
We elected to assess whether Hsp27 and Hsp70 would affect
sensitivity to non–ansamycin-based Hsp90 inhibitors. EC78 is an
orally bioavailable, purine-based inhibitor of Hsp90 with both
in vitro and in vivo tumoricidal activity. Importantly, EC78
sensitivity was not significantly affected by P-gp expression in
cells (44). Immunoprecipitation of p23 from A549GARS cells
treated with DMSO, 1 Amol/L 17-AAG, or 2 Amol/L EC78 revealed
that EC78 inhibits Hsp90 binding to p23 (Fig. 6A, top). This
indicates that EC78 is an effective Hsp90 inhibitor in vitro.
Notably, EC78 also caused an up-regulation of Hsp70 in a manner
similar to 17-AAG (Fig. 6A, bottom). Because sensitivity to EC78 is
independent of P-gp activity (44), we assessed whether knockdown
of Hsp27 and Hsp70 influenced resistance to EC78. Western
blotting confirmed the siRNA-induced knockdown even in the
presence of EC78 (Fig. 6B). Clonogenic assays revealed that Hsp27,
Hsp70, or combined Hsp27 and Hsp70 knockdown resulted in
similar decreases in EC78 resistance in A549GARS cells [IC75 of
178 F 126 nmol/L (P < 0.04), 301 F 138 nmol/L (P < 0.07), and
299 F 121 nmol/L (P < 0.07), respectively, compared with control
siRNA IC75 of 970 F 238 nmol/L; Fig. 6C]. These results suggest
that inhibition of Hsp27 and/or Hsp70 may decrease resistance to
17-AAG, as well as new classes of Hsp90 inhibitors.

Discussion
Hsp90 inhibitors, specifically the GA analogue 17-AAG, have
generated interest as cancer therapeutics. Unfortunately, despite
in vitro and in vivo tumoricidal activity (13–15), 17-AAG has had
limited single-agent clinical efficacy to date (45). Previous studies
have shown that this inactivity is not likely due to lack of client
protein degradation (9), decreased drug uptake by tumor cells (46),
or metabolism by NAD(P)H/quinone oxidoreductase I (47).
Studies to identify resistance mechanisms to GA indicate that
P-gp expression may contribute to decreased 17-AAG sensitivity.
Benchekroun and colleagues first identified a potential role for
P-gp in GA resistance by showing that MCF7/ADRR was 100-fold
resistant to GA and treatment with the P-gp inhibitor VP increased
sensitivity to GA (39). A second study by this group revealed that
GA interacts with P-gp and that cells resistant to GA or ADR had
decreased uptake of GA (43). Huang and colleagues reported that
cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of ABC transporters, sensitized
resistant cells to GA and indicated that GA may be both an
inhibitor and substrate for P-gp activity (42). Studies by Radujkovic
and colleagues also support the hypothesis that GA analogues can
act as both substrates and inhibitors of P-gp (41). More recently,
other studies have indicated that other drug transporters, such as
multidrug resistance protein 1, may also be implicated in 17-AAG
resistance (48).
Treatment with Hsp90-directed agents, such as 17-AAG, induces
a dramatic up-regulation of stress-responsive proteins, including
Hsp70 and Hsp27. Interestingly, P-gp is also induced by stress, such
as heat shock, which is consistent with the discovery of an HSE
promoter located in the MDR1 gene (26). We have found that
treatment with GA or its analogues induces P-gp expression, likely
as a result of the HSF-1–mediated cellular stress response. There
are two important implications of this finding. First, when 17-AAG
is combined with chemotherapeutic agents that are P-gp
substrates, it would be advisable to treat in a sequence with the

chemotherapeutic first followed by 17-AAG. It is of note that
Munster and colleagues (49) found that Taxol followed by 17-AAG
was synergistic, attributing this result to an Rb-dependent cell cycle
effect. However, when 17-AAG was followed by Taxol, less apoptotic
cell death occurred. Based on our results, P-gp induction by
17-AAG may contribute to this effect because Taxol is an identified P-gp substrate. The second implication of P-gp induction by
17-AAG is that chronic treatment with Hsp90-targeted agents could
cause resistance to future cycles of therapy because GA can cause
an MDR1 duplication event that would could lead to a more
permanent MDR phenotype.
Whereas P-gp did confer GA resistance in cells selected for P-gp–
mediated resistance (MCF-7/ADRR), it seems to play a minor role
in cells selected for GA resistance. In contrast, stress-inducible
proteins Hsp27 and Hsp70 had dramatic effects on GA resistance.
Our data showed that knockdown of Hsp27 or Hsp70 alone was
sufficient to reverse resistance to 17-AAG and EC78 in A549GARS,
whereas inhibition of P-gp by VP was not. Furthermore, VP
treatment did not contribute to reversal of resistance by Hsp27
knockdown in A549GARS, which is in contrast to MCF-7/ADRR.
Although we conclude that P-gp may contribute in part to 17-AAG
resistance, our data are consistent with induction of Hsp70 and
Hsp27 playing a much larger role. The mechanism whereby these
two proteins may contribute to resistance has been elucidated in
part. Hsp70 may contribute to 17-AAG resistance by inhibiting
17-AAG–induced Bax conformational and localization change and
mitochondria-initiated apoptosis (29). Schmitt and colleagues
showed that inhibiting Hsp70 function by treatment with a peptide
that mimics the Hsp70 binding partner apoptosis-inducing factor
resulted in additive cell killing when combined with Hsp90
inhibitors (30). Subsequently, studies in our laboratory have shown
that Hsp27 can contribute to 17-AAG resistance through increased
glutathione synthesis (31). It is notable that Hsp27, which we
previously reported to contribute to 17-AAG resistance, is found
within 1 million bp of P-gp on the long arm of chromosome 7,
which is duplicated in the A549GARS. This may explain the pivotal

role of Hsp27 in the resistance phenotype of A547GARS. However,
our data do not exclude participation of Hsp70 and Hsp27 in
17-AAG resistance through other prosurvival functions, including
management of misfolded and aggregated proteins. It is important
to remember that other studies using cells with acquired GA
resistance suggest that more than one resistance mechanism can
occur in cells chronically treated with ansamycin-based Hsp90targeted agents (39). In particular, it remains to be determined if
other stress-inducible proteins add to Hsp90 inhibitor resistance.
From our data, we conclude that induction of a stress response
increases resistance to Hsp90-directed agents. This is important
because this induction will likely result in limited effectiveness of
single-agent Hsp90-targeted therapy, which is consistent with the
results of a number of clinical trials reported to date (50). Taken
together, our results would support the development of agents that
target proteins involved in the stress response, such as HSF-1,
Hsp27, and/or Hsp70. These new agents could be combined with
Hsp90-directed therapy to inhibit the stress response induced by
17-AAG and other Hsp90-targeted therapies. Whether such a
strategy will have an effective therapeutic index will necessitate the
evaluation of such combinations in vivo.
