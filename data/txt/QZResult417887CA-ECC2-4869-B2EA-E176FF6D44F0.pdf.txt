ABSTRACT
High mortality in pancreatic cancer patients is partly due to resistance to
chemotherapy. We describe that human pancreatic cancer cells acquire drug resistance
by a novel mechanism in which they expel and remove chemotherapeutic drugs from
the microenvironment via microvesicles (MVs). Using human pancreatic cancer cells
that exhibit varied sensitivity to gemcitabine (GEM), we show that GEM exposure
triggers the cancer cells to release MVs in an amount that correlates with that cell
line’s sensitivity to GEM. The importance of MV-release in gaining drug resistance in
GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer cells was confirmed when the inhibition of MV-release
sensitized the cells to GEM treatment, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MVs
remove drugs that are internalized into the cells and that are in the microenvironment.
The differences between the drug-resistant and drug-sensitive pancreatic cancer cell
lines tested here are explained based on the variable content of influx/efflux proteins
present on MVs, which directly dictates the ability of MVs either to trap GEM or to
allow GEM to flow back to the microenvironment.

contain specific antigens that are unique to their cells’
origin [8]. MVs play a significant role in both tumor
survival and progression [1, 9–14].
MVs enable acquisition of drug resistance in cancer
cells by transferring drug transporter proteins MRP1
and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) from drug-resistant cancer
cells to drug-sensitive cancer cells [15–17]. Release of
exosomes was shown to be a mechanism in acidosismediated cisplatin resistance in human melanoma cells
[18, 19]. In colon cancer cells, enhanced secretion of
miR-145 and miR-34a via MVs increased the cells’
resistance to 5-fluorouracil [20]. In an attempt to make
vehicles to deliver anticancer agents, exosomes released
by mesenchymal stem cells treated with paclitaxel were
found to contain paclitaxel [21]. These findings suggested

INTRODUCTION
Microvesicles are a class of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) with a phospholipid membrane bilayer and are
released by all types of cells. There is not yet a general,
accepted classification of EVs because of a lack of specific
markers and characteristics that can define the subsets of
EVs, namely, microparticles, microvesicles, exosomes,
oncosomes, and apoptotic bodies. Although there are
challenges in the identification and characterization of
EVs, the release of EVs by cells occurs in a regulated
manner [1, 2]. Based on the method of isolation and
morphology [3–7], the class of EVs in this study will be
referred to as microvesicles (MVs). MVs are derived from
external budding and pinching of plasma membrane and

a role for MVs in cellular drug resistance, but the actual
mechanism is not understood.
Here, we identify that MVs facilitate the removal
of therapeutic drugs both from human pancreatic cancer
cells and from their microenvironment and enable the
cells to resist gemcitabine (GEM). Using a panel of human
pancreatic cancer cells with graded ability to resist GEM,
we show that (i) GEM triggers the release of MVs in an
amount that correlates with the cells’ ability to resist GEM,
(ii) MV-release is essential to GEM resistance because
inhibition of MV-release in drug-resistant pancreatic
cancer cell lines sensitizes cells to GEM both in vitro and
in vivo, (iii) GEM regulates the amount of both influx and
efflux proteins on MVs, and (iv) MVs remove drugs that
enter cells and drugs present in the microenvironment.
Based on the composition of influx and efflux proteins on
MVs, the ability of MVs to trap the drugs (when released
by GEM-resistant cells) or to allow the drugs to flow
back to the microenvironment (when released by GEMsensitive cells) was differentiated among the studied
pancreatic cancer cell lines.

Pancreatic cancer cells release MVs in an
amount that correlates with their ability to resist
GEM
The degree of GEM resistance by six pancreatic cell
lines was determined after treating them with 1 μM GEM
and calculating their percentage of cell death. We chose
GEM because it is often used as first-line therapy, though
it is palliative in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
GEM resistance was MPanc-96 = Suit-2 = Capan-2 >
MiaPaCa-2 > L36pl > BxPc3 (Supplemental Figure S1).
We then tested if there was any correlation between the
degree of drug resistance and the cells’ ability to release
MVs, as outlined in Figure 1A. Suit-2, MiaPaCa-2, L36pl,
and BxPc3 were used because they represent a continuum
of resistance to GEM. Cells were treated with either
GEM or procainamide, an anti-arrhythmic drug [22]. In
response to treatment with GEM for 15 min, the amount
of MVs released by Suit-2, MiaPaCa-2, and L36pl cells

was significantly higher compared to the amount of MVs
released by untreated control or procainamide-treated
cells. There was no significant increase in the release
of MVs by BxPc3 cells after 15 min. After 45 min, the
amount of MVs released by Suit-2 and MiaPaCa-2 cells
was significantly higher compared to the amount of MVs
released by procainamide-treated cells. There was no
significant increase in the release of MVs by L36pl and
BxPc3 cells after 45 min (Figure 1B). Collectively, the
amount of MVs released by pancreatic cancer cells in

response to GEM correlates to the cells’ ability to resist
GEM; the greater the resistance, the larger the amount of
MVs released. No such correlation was seen in response
to procainamide.
To characterize the isolated MVs, we determined
their size distribution using dynamic light scattering
(DLS). MVs released by cells ranged from 23 – 995 nm
(Figure 2A - 2D). Because the sizes obtained with DLS
cannot distinguish membrane vesicles from co-isolated
non-membranous particles of similar size, we used atomic

force microscopy (AFM) both to confirm the presence of
membrane vesicles and to provide an indication of the
heterogeneity and morphology of the vesicle preparation.
Wide field AFM images of MVs (Figure 2E-2H) reveal the
heterogeneity of the vesicles and confirm the data obtained
from DLS analysis. Close-up images of MVs (Figure
2I-2L) show single membranous vesicles and clustered
vesicles, revealing the morphology and membranous
nature of the vesicles isolated.

surfaces of MVs, we rinsed MVs additionally with PBS
before lysis, and the PBS wash was analyzed for drugs.
Consistently, the amount of drug in the wash was 5- to
80-fold less compared to the amount detected in the
corresponding lysates (data not shown). We further tested
if MVs released by other cancer cell types also facilitate
removal of therapeutic drugs. For this, we used FMMC
419II breast cancer cells, which are highly resistant to
therapeutic drugs due to their stem cell properties [23].
Both the treated cells and the MVs they released contained
doxorubicin (Supplemental Figure S9), suggesting
that MVs released by breast cancer cells, in addition
to pancreatic cancer cells, also facilitate removal of
therapeutic drugs.

Therapeutic drugs are detected in released MVs
To test the hypothesis that pancreatic cancer cells
use MVs to remove drugs to mitigate the intracellular
concentration, we treated Suit-2 (most resistant to GEM)
and L36pl cells (least resistant to GEM) with GEM for 45
min and analyzed for GEM in the released MVs. GEM
was present in the MVs released by both Suit-2 and L36pl
(Figure 3A). To confirm that this phenomenon is not
unique to GEM, we used 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel,
which are routinely used in the treatment of pancreatic
cancer. We also used procainamide, which is not specific
to pancreatic cancer cells, and ampicillin, which is not
specific to mammalian cells. HPLC-MS/MS analysis
revealed that all the drugs were present in both the total
cell lysates and in MV-lysates of Suit-2 and L36pl cells
(Figure 3B & Supplemental Figure S2). Analytical details
for each drug are shown in Supplemental Figures S3S8. To prevent contamination from drugs from the outer

Inhibition of MV-release sensitizes GEMresistant pancreatic cells to GEM in vitro
We next investigated if the release of MVs is
critical for the pancreatic cancer cells to resist GEM.
Release of MVs is extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) dependent and enabled by ARF6-GTP-dependent
recruitment of ERK to the plasma membrane for ERK
activation [24]. We inhibited ERK activation using a
pharmacological (MEK inhibitor, U0126) inhibitor and
a genetic mutation (expression of dominant negative
mutant of ARF6, ARF6 T27N) in cell lines that exhibit
highest resistance to GEM (Suit-2 and MPanc-96). Cell
proliferation and cell death were assessed in these two

cell lines after treatment with GEM in the presence or
absence of U0126. After 72 h, there was ~ 50% reduction
in Suit-2 proliferation upon treatment with U0126 alone,
40% reduction with GEM alone, and 30% reduction with
a combination of U0126 and GEM (Figure 4A) with
statistical significance (P < 0.05). A similar trend was
observed in MPanc-96 cells (Figure 4B). Death assessment
at 72 h in Suit-2 cells showed an 11-fold increase in cell
death upon combinatorial treatment with U0126 and
GEM, compared to control, while the cell death was only
2-fold and 6-fold when treated with GEM alone or U0126
alone, respectively (Figure 4C). Though not to the same
degree, combinatorial treatment with U0126 and GEM
increased the cell death in MPanc-96 cells compared to
control and single treatments (Figure 4D).
To inhibit ERK activation via a genetic mutation, we
generated Suit-2T27N cells that stably express the dominant
negative mutant of ARF6 to disrupt ERK recruitment
to plasma membrane for activation. Inhibition of ERK
phosphorylation—and as a consequence MV-release—in
Suit-2T27N cells was confirmed (Supplemental Figure S10).
Suit-2T27N cells were treated with 1 μM GEM and assessed
for cell proliferation and cell death. Cell proliferation
was significantly reduced in Suit-2T27N cells compared to
parental Suit-2 cells at 48 and 72 h (Figure 4E). At 72 h,
compared to untreated cells, parental Suit-2 cells showed
a 5-fold reduction and Suit-2T27N cells exhibited a 7-fold
reduction in proliferation. When analyzed for cell death,
the increase observed in Suit-2T27N cells was significantly
higher compared to parental cells at all time points (P <
0.05) (Figure 4F). Thus, the release of MVs is crucial
for pancreatic cancer cells to resist drugs and therefore
inhibiting their release sensitizes drug-resistant pancreatic
cancer cells to GEM in vitro.

was confirmed by western analysis (data not shown). The
other half of the pancreas was processed and stained for
histological analysis. In general the histologic findings
confirmed the gross observations. The transplanted tumor
cells form fairly discrete masses of undifferentiated
adenocarcinoma cells within the pancreas. Although there
is a clear demarcation between tumor and uninvolved
pancreas in most lesions, occasionally there were strands
of tumor cells invading the pancreas for a short distance
in the large tumors. Tumor size varied greatly among
treatment groups as measured with a stage micrometer
(Supplemental Table S1 and Figure 5C-5H). A portion of
the tumor was analyzed using histological stain (Figure
5I-5N). The Suit-2 tumors from the GEM-treatment group
appear to have a smaller volume than Suit-2 tumors from
the PBS-treated group, even though bioluminescence
analysis showed no difference between the tumor sizes
within these two treatment groups. However, the group
treated with both AZD6244 and GEM showed complete
absence of any tumor, such that the pathologist scored
them as ‘normal pancreases’ (Figure 5L). The Suit-2T27N
tumors from mice treated with GEM were made up
of small cells with great nuclear variation from small
mononuclear to larger multinucleated cells with large
nucleoli, with areas containing many mitoses (black
arrows, Figure 5N) and apoptotic cells (red arrows, Figure
5N). Analysis of necrotic regions on the tissue sections
followed the trend similar to tumor volume analysis
(Supplemental Table S1). Tumors from the combination
treatment group showed no necrosis. The larger Suit2T27N tumors treated with PBS had large areas of necrosis
(Figure 5G, 5M). The percentage of necrotic tissues
decreased by ~2-fold in GEM-treated-Suit-2T27N tumors
compared to the PBS-treated group.
Thus, the release of MVs is important for pancreatic
cancer cells to resist drugs, and therefore inhibiting their
release sensitizes drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cells to
GEM in vivo.

Inhibition of MV-release sensitizes GEMresistant pancreatic cells to GEM in vivo
To confirm if inhibiting MV-release also can
sensitize pancreatic tumor growth in vivo, tumors
developed from orthotopically implanted Suit-2-luc or
Suit-2T27N-luc cells in mice were treated with GEM in the
presence and absence of a MEK inhibitor, AZD6244. At
the end of treatment, the difference in tumor size based
on viable cells present in the tumor was compared using
the luminescence. There was a 4-fold decrease in the
luminescence of Suit-2 tumors treated with both GEM and
AZD6244 compared to the PBS-treated mice (Figure 5A,
5B), and Suit-2 tumors treated with AZD6244 alone had
only ~ 2-fold decrease compared to the PBS-treated group.
The Suit-2T27N tumors treated with GEM alone showed a
4-fold decrease in luminescence compared to PBS-treated
group (Figure 5B).

Internalized GEM is packaged into MVs before
MV-release from cells
We next determined the source of GEM that is
removed by the MVs. Is it the GEM that gained entry into
cells that gets trafficked into MVs before their release, or
is it the GEM in the microenvironment that enters MVs
after MV-release, or both?
We did an expulsion assay to determine if GEM that
gains entry into the cells gets packaged into MVs (Figure
6A). Both MVs and total cell lysates of Suit-2 and L36pl
contained GEM after 45 min (Figure 6B & Supplemental
Figure S11). In L36pl cells there was a continued
presence of GEM in the MVs released after 45 min, 3 h,
and 22 h, indicating that the GEM that gained entry into
cells continued to be removed via the released MVs. In

contrast, in Suit-2 cells, although GEM was detected in the
cell lysates after 45 min, 3 h, and 22 h, GEM was found
in MVs only at 45 min and 3 h, but not at 4, 6, or 22
h (4 and 6 h data not shown). The presence of GEM in
MVs released by cells (exposed to GEM) in a GEM-free
microenvironment indicates that GEM that gained entry
into cells was removed via MVs.

We did an inflow assay to determine if GEM present
in the microenvironment can also gain entry into MVs
(Figure 6C). MVs released by both Suit-2 cells and L36pl
contained 13C[15N2]-GEM, confirming that drug from

GEM treatment specifically increases the amount
of influx and efflux protein on MVs

the microenvironment can enter released MVs (Figure
6D & Supplemental Figure S12A). Analytical details
for 13C[15N2]-GEM are in Supplemental Figure S12B.
However, there was no GEM detected in MVs released
by Suit-2 cells, and GEM was detected in MVs released
by L36pl cells in only one of two trials. Thus, GEM in
the microenvironment can gain entry into MVs after MVrelease.

GEM is a drug that requires transporter proteins
to cross cell membrane [25]. Since GEM in the
microenvironment also gained entry into the released
MVs, we hypothesized that MVs contain transporter
proteins. To test this, MVs were isolated from Suit-2 and

L36pl cells treated with either GEM or procainamide.
The presence of transporter proteins relevant to GEM,
namely, influx protein ENT1 and efflux proteins MRP1,
MRP5, and P-gp, was analyzed in the lysates. Upon GEM
exposure, Suit-2 cells did not exhibit any significant
differences in the efflux proteins MRP5 or P-gp (not
detected, data not shown) and MRP1 (Figure 7A). While
there was no change in ENT1 levels in the cell lysates,
levels increased by 2-fold in the MVs released by cells
treated with GEM compared to MVs released by untreated
cells in both Suit-2 (Figure 7A) and L36pl (Figure 7B). In
L36pl cells, GEM exposure did not change MRP1 levels.
However, there was a 7-fold increase in the P-gp levels
and an 8-fold increase in the MRP5 levels in the MVs
released by GEM-treated cells compared to MVs released
by untreated cells; there was no significant change in their
expression in total cell lysates (Figure 7B). Procainamide
treatment did not affect the expression of transporter
proteins in Suit-2 cells (Figure 7A), L36pl cells (Figure
7C), or MVs. Thus, collectively GEM exposure increases
the levels of ENT1 (influx protein) on the MVs released
by both Suit-2 and L36pl cells and increases the levels
of P-gp and MRP-5 (efflux proteins) only on the MVs
released by L36pl (GEM-sensitive cell line) and not Suit2 (GEM-resistant cell line).

differences between MVs released by drug-resistant and
drug-sensitive cells and these are summarized in Table 1.
In prior growth inhibition studies performed in
pancreatic cancer cells, AZD6244 was ineffective in vitro,
but effective in vivo [26–29]. We were therefore limited
to using U0126 in vitro and using AZD6244 in vivo. The
combinatorial treatment eradicated Suit-2 tumor cells and
restored normal pancreas anatomy. However, it did not
completely eradicate Suit-2T27N tumor cells, which could
be due to larger initial Suit-2T27N tumor size compared
to Suit-2 tumors for the treatment period. There is no
known link between ARF6 and trafficking/translocation
of transporter proteins for therapeutic drugs. Although
stable expression of ARF6-T27N has been shown to
affect tumor cell invasion, it does not alter the cell cycle
progression because it caused only a small increase in the
number of cells in the G2-M phase in melanoma cells [30].
Nonetheless, GEM treatment reduced viable Suit-2T27N
tumor cells by 4-fold compared to PBS-treated Suit-2T27N
tumors, and a similar fold reduction was seen in Suit-2
tumors treated with AZD6244 + GEM (Figure 4B). A
recent study published by Vena et al. [31] also showed that
the efficacy of GEM treatment was enhanced in pancreatic
cancer models when administered in combination with a
MEK1/2 inhibitor, Pimasertib. This study proposed a
mechanism independent of MV-release for the increased
efficacy. Thus, it cannot be excluded that MEK inhibition
can also affect the survival of pancreatic cancer cells
independently of MVs [32–34].
The presence of control drugs (ampicillin and
procainamide) within MVs released by pancreatic cancer
cells suggests that cancer cells may not exert structural
or functional specificity in drug-expulsion via MVs. In
this context, it is tempting to speculate that normal cells
also may employ MVs to buttress the role of P-gp in toxic
agent expulsions. The estimation of drugs within MVs is
calculated per mg of protein lysates of MVs and not per
MV, thus is only semi-quantitative and is a limitation of
this study.
In addition to confirming that the GEM that entered
cells was removed via MVs, the expulsion assay also
revealed differences in GEM clearance in MVs between
drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cell lines. While there
was a ~10-fold difference in the amount of GEM in MVs
released by Suit-2 cells between 45 min and 3 h, there
was only a ~2-fold difference in the amount of GEM in
the MVs released by L36pl cells (Figure 6A). Because we
measured only GEM and not its metabolites, we suspect
that the difference in GEM clearance could be due to
differences in the levels or activity of GEM-metabolizing
enzymes in MVs released by these cells.
The absence of GEM in the MVs released by Suit2 cells as observed in the inflow assay can be explained
by increased GEM clearance, given that the GEM in the
MVs released by Suit-2 cells is not detectable even after

GEM is exported by MVs released by L36pl cells
but not by MVs released by Suit-2 cells
The increase in the efflux proteins on MVs released
by L36pl cells upon GEM treatment and not by Suit2 cells led us to hypothesize that GEM can flow out of
the MVs when released by L36pl cells but is trapped
in the MVs when released by Suit-2 cells. To test this,
we performed a retention assay (Figure 8). While GEM
flowed out of the MVs released by L36pl cells into the
supernatant, there was no flow of GEM from the MVs
released by Suit-2 cells (Figure 8 & Supplemental Figure
S13). Procainamide was exported out of the MVs released
by both Suit-2 and L36pl cells, indicating the specificity of
transporter proteins in the transport of GEM.

DISCUSSION
Although chemotherapy is a primary strategy
to treat cancer in patients, the ability of cancer cells to
resist chemotherapy can cause the treatment to fail.
It is therefore important to have a comprehensive
understanding of mechanisms exploited by cancer cells to
resist drug actions in order to develop efficient therapeutic
strategies.
Here, we show for the first time that release of
MVs by pancreatic cancer cells enables drug resistance
by removing anticancer drugs that have entered the cells
and that are in the microenvironment. We also elucidated

5 h had elapsed (2 isolations of MVs for ~3 h + 2 h of
incubation) by the time the MVs were isolated for analysis.
It is, however, intriguing that only trace levels of GEM

were detected (281 pg/mg) in one of the two replicates in
MVs released by L36pl cells, whereas GEM was detected
in MVs from L36pl cells even after 22 h (expulsion assay).
This can be explained by the presence of high levels of

resistance.

were obtained from MMTV-PyMT mice [23]. MPanc-96
and Suit-2 cells express luciferase gene constitutively.
L36pl cells were cultured in RPMI media, Capan-2 cells
were cultured in McCoy5a media, and all other cell lines
were cultured in DMEM and maintained at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 humidified incubator. Suit-2T27N cell line that stably
expresses a dominant negative mutant of ARF6, ARF6T27N, was generated by transfection of pCDNA3 HA
ARF6 DN T27N plasmid, a gift from Thomas Roberts
(Addgene plasmid # 10831) [37], with constant selection
in G418 (200 µg/mL).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

MV isolation, quantitation, and size
distribution

Materials

Equal numbers of cells were plated and media
was changed after 24 h with or without drug treatment.
MVs were isolated by differential centrifugation [3],
first at 150 x g for 10 min to remove cells and larger
debris, followed by 2,500 x g centrifugation for 20 min
to pellet larger apoptotic bodies. The supernatant devoid
of apoptotic bodies was centrifuged at 12,200 x g for 40
min to pellet MVs. Isolated MVs were rinsed once in PBS
and resuspended in PBS and quantitated by measuring
surface proteins using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific,
Wilmington, DE). Size distribution of MVs was analyzed
at 25°C with dynamic light scattering (DLS) using
a Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern Instrumentation Co,
Westborough, MA).

Media (DMEM, McCoy5a, RPMI), penicillin,
streptomycin, FBS, L-glutamine, G418, along with GEM,
doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, procainamide,
and ampicillin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO) and reconstituted as per manufacturer’s
instructions. Selumetinib (AZD6244) was purchased from
ChemieTek (Indianapolis, IN) and reconstituted in 1X
PBS at 10 mg/mL concentration, which formed a white,
turbid suspension. GEM was dissolved in 1X PBS at 5
mg/mL. U0126 was purchased from Tocris Biosciences
(Bristol, UK) and reconstituted in DMSO at 10 mM.
13
C[15N2]-GEM (99% purity) was obtained from Moravek
Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Methanol, acetonitrile (HPLC
grade), formic acid, and acetic acid were purchased from
Mallinckrodt Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). Antibodies against
P-gp, ENT1, MRP1, MRP5, β-actin, and secondary
antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge,
MA), and antibodies against phospho-ERK and total-ERK
were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) and
ARF6 from Abgent (San Diego, CA). The antibodies were
previously published [35].

Atomic force microscopy
Isolated MVs from all cell lines were resuspended
in PBS. Structural analysis and imaging of MVs were
performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (MFP
3D, Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA), using semidry mode of scanning at the Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute Core Facility (Troy, NY). Single crystal high
resolution silicon AFM probe from NT-MDT (NSG03)
with a rectangle cantilever was used. The AFM probe had
a cantilever force constant of around 1.8 N/m, a resonance
frequency of 70 kHz, and a tip radius of less than 10 nm.

Cell culture
Pancreatic cancer cells MPanc-96, L36pl, Suit2, BxPc3, and MiaPaCa-2 were obtained from Dr.
Thiruvengadam Arumugam (MD Anderson Cancer

used for analyzing samples. Sample (12.5 µL) was
transferred into a 15-mL polypropylene tube, and 12.5
μL of acetonitrile:Milli-Q water (1:9, % v/v) was added,
vortex mixed, and transferred for HPLC–MS/MS analysis.
Standard solutions were prepared in acetonitrile:Milli-Q
water (1:9, % v/v). Identification and quantification of
GEM, 13C[15N2]-GEM, 5-fluorouracil, ampicillin, and
paclitaxel in lysates, PBS wash, media, and control
samples were performed with an Applied Biosystems API
2000 electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at a resolving
power of 0.70 FWHM. Individual parameters to measure
GEM, 13C[15N2]-GEM, 5-fluorouracil, ampicillin,
and paclitaxel are provided in detail in Supplemental
Information.

MTT proliferation assay
Equal numbers of cells were seeded in 96well plates and treated with appropriate drugs. After
appropriate passage of time, cell proliferation was
measured by Vybrant MTT (3(4, 5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay as per
manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY). The optical absorbance was read at 540 nm using
Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT).

Immunofluorescence staining
Cultured cells plated on glass coverslips were fixed
and processed as described earlier [30]. F-actin distribution
was visualized by staining with rhodamine-phalloidin
substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE).
Cells were visualized with a Nikon microscope coupled
to a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 scanning confocal three-channel
system.

Animal studies
NCr male nude mice aged 5–6 weeks were
purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN)
and maintained under recommended, controlled conditions
with ad libitum access to water and food. All animal
studies were conducted at the animal facility of the Veteran
Affairs Medical Center, Albany, NY, in accordance with
the institutional guidelines for humane animal treatment
and according to the current NIH guidelines. Suit-2-luc
cells and Suit-2T27N-luc cells were orthotopically implanted
(2 x 105 cells in 50 μL PBS per mouse) in the pancreas of
anesthetized mice. Prior to initiating treatments, animals
(n = 5 or 6 per group) were randomized according to the
signal intensity of tumors imaged with an in vivo imaging
system (IVIS, described in Supplemental Information).
GEM at 25 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally twice a
week, and AZD6244 [39] was administered orally, daily at
50 mg/kg. There were 4 treatment groups for Suit-2 tumors
(PBS, AZD6244, GEM, and GEM + AZD6244) and 2
treatment groups for Suit-2T27N tumors (PBS and GEM).
After 28 days of treatment, pancreases along with tumors
were collected and imaged for bioluminescent signal
intensity and weighed. Samples were frozen for molecular
analysis, and a portion was fixed for histopathological
studies.

Protein sample preparation and western blotting
Protein lysates from cells were prepared using
either CelLytic™ M buffer or RIPA buffer, containing
protease inhibitor cocktail and/or phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of proteins were
separated by SDS electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF
membrane, and probed with appropriate primary and
secondary antibody. The signals were developed using
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). Blots were
imaged with Chemidoc XRS (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and
net band intensity was measured with ImageLab software
(Bio-Rad).

Flow cytometry for apoptosis quantitation
Equal numbers of cells were plated and treated
with either 1 or 10 µM GEM. After 24, 48, and 72 h cells
were harvested and resuspended in Annexin binding
buffer. Apoptotic cells were double stained using an
Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
[38]. Flow analysis of the stained cells was performed
using FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) at the Neural Stem
Cell Institute (Rensselaer, NY).

Histopathology
Sections from formalin-fixed specimens were
processed and stained routinely for analysis. Individual
sections (2 per animal) were blinded for identity
and presence of tumor, and necrosis was scored by a
board certified pathologist (S. S.). The tumor size was
obtained by measuring the cross diameters using a stage
micrometer. Percentage of necrosis in tumor mass and
number of cells undergoing mitoses and apoptosis were
estimated per high powered field. Sections were imaged
using an Olympus BX51 light microscope with a model
U-LH100HG digital camera.

HPLC-MS/MS analysis of GEM, 13C[15N2]-GEM,
5-fluorouracil, ampicillin, and paclitaxel
Total cells and isolated MVs were lysed in
CelLytic™M buffer. A dilute-and-shoot protocol was
