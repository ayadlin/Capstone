ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to assess niraparib (MK-4827), a novel poly(ADPRibose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, for its ability to radiosensitize human tumor
cells. Human tumor cells derived from lung, breast and prostate cancers were tested
for radiosensitization by niraparib using clonogenic survival assays. Both p53 wildtype and p53-defective lines were included. The ability of niraparib to alter the
repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) was determined using
detection of γ-H2AX foci and RAD51 foci. Clonogenic survival analyses indicated that
micromolar concentrations of niraparib radiosensitized tumor cell lines derived from
lung, breast, and prostate cancers independently of their p53 status but not cell
lines derived from normal tissues. Niraparib also sensitized tumor cells to H2O2 and
converted H2O2-induced single strand breaks (SSBs) into DSBs during DNA replication.
These results indicate that human tumor cells are significantly radiosensitized by the
potent and selective PARP-1 inhibitor, niraparib, in the in vitro setting. The mechanism
of this effect appears to involve a conversion of sublethal SSBs into lethal DSBs
during DNA replication due to the inhibition of base excision repair by the drug.
Taken together, our findings strongly support the clinical evaluation of niraparib in
combination with radiation.

INTRODUCTION

[3]. Although DSBs are considered to be the main
lethal lesions [4], SSBs can also contribute to lethality
if their repair is compromised thereby causing them to
be converted to DSBs. SSBs are repaired by the base
excision repair (BER) pathway [5] and DSBs are repaired
through two pathways, the non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) and the homologous recombination repair (HRR)
pathways [4, 6].
These DNA repair pathways are generally very
complex and are comprised of the activities of many
different proteins. Thus, many targets can be identified for
inhibition that would suppress DNA repair and lead to the
increased cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging chemotherapy
drugs and radiation. However, in spite of this abundance
of potential targets, one DNA repair protein in particular,

There is increasing interest in combining
molecularly targeted agents with conventional
therapeutics, including chemotherapy drugs and ionizing
radiation, for the treatment of human cancer [1]. Based
on the fact that the cytotoxicity of radiation and many
such drugs is due to the induction of damage to DNA,
a promising strategy for enhancing the effectiveness of
these treatments is to inhibit the pathways for repairing
these DNA lesions [2]. Thus, there has been a concerted
effort to develop molecularly targeted agents that
specifically inhibit DNA repair processes. In the case of
ionizing radiation, the principal DNA lesions are single
strand breaks (SSBs) and double strand breaks (DSBs)

poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), has received
considerable attention. Several pharmaceutical companies
have developed novel PARP inhibitors and initiated clinical
trials with these agents either alone or in combination with
DNA-damaging drugs such as cisplatin [7-9]. PARP-1 is
a member of a family of 18 such proteins of which only
PARP-1 and 2 are known to bind to DNA and function
in DNA repair [10, 11]. Essential to its activity, PARP-1
has an N-terminal DNA binding domain that enables it to
bind to SSBs and DSBs [12]. Following DNA binding,
PARP-1’s enzymatic activity is triggered and it functions
to add poly(ADP-ribose) polymers to histones and other
proteins including itself [10]. This in turn facilitates the
recruitment of DNA repair proteins to the site of the DNA
lesions. PARP-1 is essential for the repair of SSBs by the
BER pathway where it enables the recruitment of proteins
key to BER such as DNA polymerase β and XRCC1 [13,
14]. Thus, inhibition of PARP-1 can sensitize tumor cells
to classes of DNA damaging drugs that induce lesions
subject to the BER repair pathway such as temozolomide,
cyclophosphamide, camptothecin, etc. [15-17]. PARP-1 is
also known to function in DSB repair where it mediates
the recruitment of MRE11 and NBS, proteins key to the
DSB repair pathways, NHEJ and HRR [18]. Therefore,
PARP-1 inhibitors potentially radiosensitize tumor cells
via two independent mechanisms; 1) inhibition of SSB
repair could lead to the ultimate conversion of SSBs to
DSBs when DNA replication is attempted past unrepaired
SSBs during S phase and 2) the prolongation of unrepaired
DSBs when DSB repair is inhibited.
The important role of PARP in radioresponse and the
efficacy of PARP inhibitors as radiosensitizers have been
investigated for more than 30 years. Indeed, the depletion
of cellular NAD, the substrate for ADP-ribose polymers,
in irradiated cells and whole animals was initially
demonstrated in the 1950s before the enzyme PARP was
even discovered in the early 1960s [19]. The first known
PARP inhibitors, nicotinamide and 3-aminobenzamide
(3-AB) and their derivatives, were subsequently shown
to suppress NAD depletion in irradiated cells leading to
an enhancement of the cytotoxic effects of radiation and
this earlier work has been reviewed previously [19, 20].
Zwelling et al. used the technique of alkaline elution to
show that 3-AB suppressed the repair of radiation-induced
SSBs [21] and our laboratory used this method to show
H2O2-induced SSBs were repaired more slowly in the
presence of 3-AB correlating with an enhanced H2O2
cytotoxicity by 3-AB [22].
Due to its lack of potency and specificity, 3-AB
is not clinically useful. Therefore, a number of thirdgeneration PARP inhibitors, some derived from the 3-AB
structure, have been developed in recent years and tested
in pre-clinical and clinical studies including olaparib from
AstraZeneca, veliparib (ABT-888) from Abbot, INO1001 from Inotek, AG014699 from Pfizer, and niraparib
(formally known as MK-4827) from Merck [23]. All

of these agents are in phase I or phase II clinical trials
for various solid tumors either alone or in combination
with conventional chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin
[7, 8]. Olaparib [24], INO-1001 [25], ABT-888 [25, 26],
and AG014361 [15] have all been shown previously
in preclinical investigations to radiosensitize various
human cell lines in vitro. Here, we report the results of
our tests of the PARP-1 inhibitor, niraparib, for its ability
to radiosensitize non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines treated in
vitro. Our results demonstrate that niraparib has potent
radiosensitizing properties that correlate with its ability to
inhibit DNA repair processes.

RESULTS
Niraparib radiosensitizes human tumor cells in a
p53-independent manner.
We assessed the ability of niraparib to radiosensitize
human tumor cells using clonogenic survival curve assays.
Various cell lines were tested including lines derived from
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and
prostate cancer. The p53 status of all of these lines had
been previously established. The optimal concentration
of niraparib and sequence of administration relative to
irradiation were validated in preliminary, pilot studies
using the NSCLC lines A549 and H1299. We determined
that 24 h treatments with 1 μmol/L prior to irradiation
were only modestly effective. In a detailed test of various
treatment sequences using A549 cells, we found that
the optimum sequence consisted of a 1 h pre-treatment
followed by a 24 h post-irradiation treatment (Fig. 1A)
and this treatment strategy was used unless otherwise
noted. To validate that niraparib inhibited PARP in these
cell lines, we treated A549 and H1299 cells with 1 μmol/L
niraparib for various times and measured PARP enzymatic
activity using a chemiluminescent assay. The results
shown in Fig. 1B show that this concentration of niraparib
inhibits PARP within 15 minutes of treatment reaching
about 85% inhibition in the A549 cells at 1 h and about
55% inhibition at 1 h for the H1299 cells.
Complete clonogenic survival curves for the four
NSCLC lines examined consisting of two with wild-type
p53, A549 and H460, and two that are null for p53, H1299
and Calu-6, were generated (Fig. 2). A549, H1299, Calu6 and H460 cells were radiosensitized independently of
their p53 status. The breast cancer lines and the prostate
cancer line were also effectively radiosensitized by
niraparib (Fig. 3). The degree of radiosensitization was
quantified from the survival curves in two different ways;
by comparing the surviving fractions at the radiation doses
of 2 and 4 Gy (SF2 and SF4) and by calculating the dose
enhancement factor (DEF), i.e. the ratio of radiation doses

to achieve a given survival level. The DEF values for all
of the cell lines examined are provided in Table 1. All of
the tumor cell lines examined displayed some degree of
radiosensitization by niraparib independently of their p53
status and many had substantial and significant changes in
SF2 and SF4 values. For example, for A549 cells, SF4 was
reduced from 0.35 ± 0.07% in the control to 0.19 ± 0.03%
(p=0.002) by niraparib.
Niraparib at the concentration of 1 μmol/L was
slightly toxic to these cell lines, typically lowering PE
by about 20%. For example, for the two cell lines used
in subsequent experiments, the PE for A549 cells was
reduced from 80.3 ± 3.8% in controls to 61.2 ± 14.3%
in niraparib treated cells and in H1299 cells PE was
reduced from 86.5 ± 2.3% to 65.8 ± 11% by niraparib.

survival curves shown in Figures 2 and 3 for the p53
defective and p53 wild-type cell lines.

These effects were typical for the other tumor cell lines
tested, independently of their p53 status and none of these
reductions in PE reached statistical significance with
the exception of the BRCA1-defective cell line, MDAMB-436 [27], where PE was reduced by niraparib from
11.5 ± 1.1% to 2.5 ± 0.9% (p=0.004). Additionally, for
the two cell lines derived from normal tissues, CCD-16
(normal lung fibroblasts) and MCF-10A (normal breast
epithelial cells); PE was not affected by niraparib in these
cell lines. Moreover, these two lines were only slightly
radiosensitized by niraparib in the case of the MCF-10A
line or not radiosensitized in the case of the CCD-16 cells
(Fig. 3 and Table 1).

Niraparib alters the kinetics of radiation-induced
DSBs and their repair.

small proportion of DSBs induced by radiation result from
the conversion of SSBs to DSBs at stalled replication
forks. Representative photomicrographs illustrating
RAD51 foci for some of these treatments are presented in
Figure S1. We also assessed whether aphidicolin altered
niraparib’s radiosensitization of clonogenic survival. The
results shown in Fig. 4E show that while aphidicolin did
not alter the radiosensitivity of A549 cells in the absence
of niraparib treatment, it did completely abrogate the
radiosensitization effect of niraparib.

Radiation induces both SSBs and DSBs but the
DSBs are considered the principal lethal lesions [4].
Thus, we tested whether the radiosensitization of NSCLC
cells by niraparib involved an alteration in the repair of
radiation-induced DSBs. A549 and H1299 cells were pretreated or not for 1 h with niraparib and then irradiated
with 2 Gy. Samples were collected as a function of time
following irradiation and analyzed for the presence of
γ-H2AX foci to detect DSBs. The results, shown in Fig.
4A, indicate that radiation-induced DSBs were prolonged
by niraparib in A549 and H1299 cells as a function of time
after treatment generally correlating with the ability of
niraparib to radiosensitize these lines (Fig. 1). The kinetics
of this effect were different in the two cell lines where the
enhancement was evident at early times after irradiation
for the A549 cells and for later times for the H1299 cells.
It was not possible from this experiment to distinguish
whether niraparib enhanced DSBs by altering, following
irradiation, their further production or by suppressing their
repair.
Although PARP inhibitors can inhibit DSB repair,
they can also induce the conversion of SSBs to DSBs
during DNA replication by inhibiting BER. To ascertain
the possible contribution of this later mechanism, we
repeated the assessment of γ-H2AX foci in irradiated A549
cells in the presence or absence of 2 μmol/L aphidicolin
to inhibit DNA replication. A549 cells were treated for 1 h
with niraparib or not and then irradiated with 2 Gy. Cells
were harvested after 1 h of additional incubation with or
without niraparib. Aphidicolin was added or not during the
1-h post-irradiation incubation period. The results show
that niraparib treatment alone enhances DSBs detected as
γ-H2AX foci 1 h after irradiation (Fig. 4B) similar to what
was seen before (Fig. 4A). However, when aphidicolin was
added during the 1-h post-irradiation incubation period,
the ability of niraparib to enhance radiation-induced DSBs
was suppressed to levels comparable to radiation alone
suggesting that the enhancement of radiation-induced
DSBs by niraparib is primarily due to a conversion
of SSBs to DSBs during DNA replication through its
ability to inhibit BER. Representative photomicrographs
illustrating γ-H2AX foci for some of these treatments are
presented in Figure 4C. We also examined the induction
of RAD51 foci in an experiment comparable to that for
the γ-H2AX foci. RAD51 has been identified as a marker
for DSBs undergoing HRR and, specifically, for HRRmediated repair of DSBs resulting from replication forks
stalled at unrepaired SSBs [4, 28, 29]. The results (Fig.
4D) show that radiation alone induces some RAD51 foci
and that these are enhanced by niraparib. Aphidicolin
substantially suppressed the ability of niraparib to enhance
radiation-induced RAD51 foci. It also suppressed RAD51
foci levels induced by radiation alone suggesting that a

during DNA replication.
To further test niraparib’s ability to inhibit BER
and convert SSBs to DSBs during DNA replication, we
used H2O2 to induce essentially pure SSBs. Thus, A549
cells were treated with niraparib or not for 1 h and then
exposed to H2O2 for 15 min at 37 degrees. Following H2O2

it can be seen that whereas H2O2 is capable of inducing

γ-H2AX foci. Aphidicolin abrogated the ability of H2O2
alone to induce γ-H2AX foci and greatly suppressed the
ability of niraparib to enhance H2O2-induced γ-H2AX
foci suggesting that H2O2 does induce lesions consistent
with DSBs due to some conversion of SSBs to DSBs
during DNA replication. Inhibition of BER by niraparib
augments this effect as expected and aphidicolin blocks
this effect. We also examined the induction of RAD51 foci
in a comparable experiment. As mentioned above, RAD51
has been identified as a marker for DSBs undergoing HRR
and, thus, we also examined the induction of RAD51
foci by H2O2. The results (Fig. 5B) show that H2O2 alone
induces some RAD51 foci and that these are enhanced by
niraparib. Aphidicolin substantially suppressed the ability
of niraparib to enhance H2O2-induced RAD51 foci. It also
suppressed RAD51 foci levels induced by H2O2 alone
suggesting that most DSBs induced by H2O2 alone are

also resulting from the conversion of SSBs to DSBs at
stalled replication forks. We also tested whether niraparib
sensitized H2O2’s cytotoxicity assessed on the basis of
clonogenic survival. The results shown in Fig. 5C show
that niraparib sensitizes A549 cells to the cytotoxic effects
of a mild H2O2 treatment. Aphidicolin suppressed to some
extent niraparib’s sensitization but this effect did not reach
statistical significance suggesting that H2O2 cytotoxicity is
not completely mediated by conversion of SSBs to DSBs
during DNA replication but may involve other aspects
of SSB repair or toxic effects of H2O2 that don’t involve
DNA damage.

DISCUSSION
There is increasing interest in PARPi as therapeutic
agents for the treatment of cancer [23]. Several such
drugs have been developed in recent years and subjected
to preclinical and clinical evaluation [30]. In this study,
we investigated the radiosensitizing abilities of niraparib,
a novel inhibitor of PARP-1/2. Niraparib may be an
especially potent PARPi. In a side-by-side comparison
with olaparib and veliparib, Murai et al. [31] showed
that niraparib was the most potent of these inhibitors for
trapping the PARP-DNA complexes that contribute to
PARPi cytotoxicity. They further reported that, based on
this mechanism, niraparib displayed the most cytotoxicity
to BRCA2-defective cells of the three PARPi tested.
We focused our tests of niraparib on cell lines
derived from three types of human tumors, i.e. NSCLC,
breast and prostate, where radiotherapy typically plays a
key role in the management of patients with these tumors
and where improvements in radioresponse in these disease
sites would be expected to provide clinical benefit. As
shown in Figures 2 and 3 and summarized in Table 1, four
p53-defective human tumor cell lines and three tumor
cell lines with wild-type p53 were all radiosensitized by
niraparib. This comparison of p53-defective and p53 wildtype cell lines suggests that the radiosensitizing effect of
niraparib is independent of their p53-status.
Cell lines of normal tissue origin were not sensitized
or sensitized to a lesser extent than were the tumor cell
lines and this correlated with the lack of a cytotoxic effect
of niraparib on these normal cells. As mentioned above,
niraparib was mildly cytotoxic to all of the tumor cell
lines reducing PE by about 20% whereas the normal cells
did not display any toxic effects. This suggests that the
DNA repair systems targeted by niraparib are not robustly
expressed in the normal cells compared to tumor cells.
Indeed, at least in the case of the lung lines, the normal
lung fibroblast line, CCD-16, was more radiosensitive
compared to the four NSCLC lines. The four NSCLC
lines, when taken together, had an average SF2 of 0.69
± 0.025 whereas the CCD-16 line had an SF2 of 0.59 ±
0.025 and this difference was statistically significant,
p=.006. Gorgoullis et al. [32] reported that, in the case of

the basis of γ-H2AX (A) or RAD51 (B) foci as detected by

the human lung, precancerous lesions and NSCLC tumors
display spontaneous DSBs compared to the normal lung
tissue presumably due to oncogene-induced replicative
stress suggesting that the DSB repair systems are already
activated in tumor cells compared to normal cells. The
lack of radiosensitization of the normal cell lines by
niraparib would be consistent with that hypothesis.
Although the radiosensitizing effect of inhibiting
PARP was first demonstrated more than 30 years ago,
the resurgence of interest in PARPi for sensitizing tumor
cells to radiation has been generated by the development
of third-generation PARPi over the past decade that may
have clinical utility. Several of these newer PARPi have
been previously examined for their radiosensitizing
properties. Of these, ABT-888 (veliparib) has been tested
to the greatest extent. Albert et al., showed that ABT-888
reduced clonogenic survival in irradiated NSCLC cells
consistent with an inhibition of radiation-induced DNA
damage [26]. ABT-888’s radiosensitizing effects have
since been confirmed for other NSCLC lines as well as
for prostate cancer cells, glioblastoma, cervical cancer
cells and colorectal cancer cells [33-37]. Another PARPi,
AZD2281 (olaparib), has been reported to increase
the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells consistent with an
increased persistence of radiation-induced DSBs [24].
Two additional PARPi, E7016 [38] and INO-1001 [25],
have both been shown to enhance the radiosensitivity of
various cell lines. Finally, AG14361 has been shown to
radiosensitize colorectal cancer cells [15] and, in a recent
report, niraparib was shown to radiosensitize human
neuroblastoma cells [39]. Additional reports illustrating
the radiosensitizing effects of these and other PARPi have
been recently reviewed [40].
Ionizing radiation induces various lesions in DNA
including DSBs, base damage and SSBs [3]. DSBs are
repaired by NHEJ and HRR [4, 6]. Base damage and
SSBs are repaired by BER [5]. DSBs represent the lethal
lesions induced by radiation because they are difficult
to repair with fidelity whereas base damage and SSBs
do not normally contribute to lethality due to the very
efficient and accurate BER repair process [4]. However,
SSBs can contribute to lethality if they are converted to
DSBs through an inhibition of BER [40]. PARPi, through
their ability to inhibit BER, cause some SSBs to be
processed into DSBs when DNA replication encounters
an unrepaired lesion [9, 41]. We observed that niraparib
appeared to radiosensitize by prolonging the presence
of DSBs in irradiated cells based on the detection of
γ-H2AX foci (Fig. 4A). However, this analysis could not
distinguish between an inhibition of repair of DSBs by
niraparib versus a conversion of SSBs to DSBs by the
drug. Thus, in analogy with previous publications [29,
42], we used aphidicolin to block DNA replication and
tested whether this would affect the level of γ-H2AX foci
produced by niraparib in irradiated cells. The results (Fig.
4B) indicated that aphidicolin lowered DSBs in niraparibwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treated cells to control levels seen with radiation alone
suggesting that the additional DSBs induced by niraparib
in irradiated cells were due to the conversion of SSBs to
DSBs during S phase.
We also observed that the kinetics of DSB
prolongation by niraparib were different between the
A549 and H1299 cells (Fig. 4A). This could be due to
the different p53 status of these two cell lines; A549 cells
having wild-type p53 and H1299 cells having null p53
status. As mentioned above, niraparib would be expected
to primarily enhance DSBs repaired through the HRR
pathway which has been shown to preferentially occur
during late S/G2 [43]. Cells with wild-type p53 have two
independent mechanisms to accumulate irradiated cells in
G2 phase thereby allowing additional time for repairing
DSBs prior to entering mitosis whereas cells with
defective p53 totally rely on activation of wee1 kinase
[44]. In a previous report from our laboratory [45], we
showed that during the first 4 h following irradiation, A549
cells accumulate in G2 more than twice as fast as H1299
cells. Thus, the difference in kinetics of DSB prolongation
seen between these two cell lines (Fig. 4A) may be due to
this difference in the rate of progression through late S and
into G2 phase, the portion of the cell cycle where niraparib
would maximally exert its enhancement of DSBs.
We conducted further experiments using H2O2 to
confirm that niraparib acts to convert SSBs to DSBs.
Although H2O2 can produce an occasional DSB due
to closely spaced SSBs on opposite DNA strands, it
essentially induces a relatively clean spectrum of SSBs
when used at physiological concentrations [22]. The
ratio of SSBs to DSBs has been estimated to be about
18:1 for ionizing radiation and about 3200:1 for H2O2
[46]. H2O2 alone induced some detectable γ-H2AX foci
but niraparib enhanced the production of these as shown
by our results (Fig. 5A). Apidicolin reversed this effect
of niraparib similar to what was seen with radiation.
In addition to using γ-H2AX foci to indicate the DSBs
produced under these conditions, we also examined the
presence of RAD51 foci in these studies using H2O2. It
has been shown previously that the DSBs resulting from
stalled replication forks are repaired by HRR and that
RAD51 is a specific marker for lesions undergoing repair
through this pathway [28, 29, 42]. This analysis confirmed
that niraparib initiated DNA lesions in H2O2-treated cells
subject to HRR but these were abrogated by aphidicolin
(Fig. 5B). These findings with H2O2 further indicate that
niraparib acts similar to previously investigated PARPi
with regard to the mechanism of radiosensitization
involving the conversion of SSBs to DSBs at stalled DNA
replication forks.
Many of the PARPi currently under evaluation have
been shown previously to have preferential cytotoxic
activity for tumor cells with mutated or non-functional
BRCA1 or BRCA2 [7, 23, 47-49]. In the original report of
the discovery of niraparib, its preferential cytotoxic effect
5082

Oncotarget

for BRCA1 defective cells was demonstrated using HeLa
cells in which BRCA1 had been silenced [27]. Here we
validated that finding using the MDA-MB-436 cells which
have mutated BRCA1. Niraparib had substantially greater
cytotoxic effect on the MDA-MB-436 cells lowering
plating efficiency by about 80% compared to the other
cell lines used in our study where niraparib alone lowered
plating efficiency by only about 20%. Also, MDAMB-436 cells appeared to be slightly more radiosensitive
than the MDA-MB-231 cells that have wild-type BRCA1
and this is the expected result considering that BRCA1 is
an important component of HRR repair [2, 18]. The fact
that MDA-MB-436 cells were radiosensitized by niraparib
(Fig. 3) suggests that radiotherapy combined with PARPi
such as niraparib has efficacy even for tumors with mutant
BRCA1.
Although the present report concerns the
radiosensitizing effects of niraparib in vitro, niraparib
has been previously tested by other members of our
team for its ability to sensitize in vivo using xenografts
made from four of the cell lines used in this report, A549,
H460, MDA-MB-231 and Calu-6 [50]. They showed,
using clinically relevant dose fractionation protocols,
that niraparib potently enhanced radiation-induced tumor
growth delay in all four of these xenograft models.
Niraparib, as a single agent, was previously shown to have
potent antitumor activity in xenograft tumors made from
the BRCA1 defective MDA-MB-436 cell line [27]. The
results of the first phase I clinical trial of niraparib have
been published recently showing that it is well tolerated
and has antitumor activity in carriers of BRCA mutations
and in patients with other cancers including NSCLC and
prostate cancer [51]. The results of this trial and others
have sparked a resurgence of interest in PARPi [52].
In conclusion, we have shown that the PARPi,
niraparib, potently radiosensitizes human tumor cells
derived from lung, breast and prostate cancers in a
p53-independent manner. The mechanism to explain
this sensitization appears to involve the conversion of
radiation-induced, sublethal SSBs into lethal DSBs
through inhibition of BER. Coupled with the previously
reported in vivo activity and results from the phase I
clinical trial, the present findings support the continued
clinical assessment of niraparib in combination with DNA
damaging agents including radiation.

RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 10,000 U/mL of penicillin-streptomycin,
and 2 mmol/L-glutamine. The identities of these cell
lines were validated during the course of this study by
short tandem repeat (STR) profiling conducted by the
institution’s Characterized Cell Line Core using the
AmpFlSTR Identifiler PCR amplification kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems).
The STR profiles for these cell lines matched their known
ATCC fingerprints. Niraparib was provided by Merck
Sharp & Dohme Corp., and its chemical structure has been
described previously [27].

Antibodies
The antibody to RAD51 (R1528) was purchased
from Sigma, and the antibody to γ-H2AX (Ser139) clone
JBW301 (05-636) antibody was purchased from Millipore.

Clonogenic assay
The effectiveness of the combination of niraparib
and ionizing radiation was assessed by clonogenic assays.
Briefly, cells growing in log phase were treated with
1 μmol/L niraparib 1 h prior to irradiation. Following
irradiation, the cells were subjected to a 24-h postirradiation treatment with 1 μmol/L niraparib. The cells
were then trypsinized and counted, and known numbers
were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes in two sets of three
for each dose of radiation. Sufficient numbers were seeded
to ensure that about 30-100 macroscopic colonies would
appear in each plate after 10-14 days. Colonies were
stained with 0.5% gentian violet in methanol and counted.
The plating efficiency (PE) for each dose was calculated
by dividing the number of colonies by the number of
cells plated and expressing the result as a percentage. The
surviving fraction was calculated by dividing the PE of
the treatment by the PE of the appropriate un-irradiated
control.

Immunofluorescence
A549 or H1299 cells were cultivated on coverslips
placed in 35-mm dishes, irradiated with 2 Gy, and treated
with 1 μmol/L niraparib as indicated. The medium was
then aspirated, and the cells were rinsed briefly in PBS
and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min.
Permeabilization was achieved by a 10-min incubation
with 100% methanol at -20°C. After three 5-min rinses in
PBS, the cells were incubated in blocking buffer (1X PBS,
50 μL/mL normal goat serum, and 0.3% Triton X-100) for
1 h at room temperature. Next, the cells were incubated in
γ-H2AX (Millipore) or RAD51 (Sigma) primary antibody
in antibody dilution buffer (1X PBS, 10 mg/mL bovine

PARP Assay

REFERENCES

The inhibition of PARP was analyzed in A549 and
H1299 cells using the HT Universal Chemiluminescent
PARP Assay Kit (Trevigen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were treated
with DMSO or 1 μmol/L niraparib for 15, 30, 60, or 120
minutes, trypsinized, and transferred to a pre-chilled
tube. The cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS
and resuspended in cold PARP extraction buffer. The
cell suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 minutes
with periodic vortexing to disrupt the cell membrane.
The suspensions were centrifuged and the supernatant
transferred to a pre-chilled tube on ice. The histone-coated
wells of the 96-well plate were rehydrated with 1X PARP
buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.
The PARP buffer was removed and 20 μg of protein as
determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay was added to
each well followed by diluted PARP-HSA enzyme and
1X PARP buffer. The strip wells were then incubated
at room temperature for 60 minutes, washed twice with
PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and then washed
with PBS. Diluted Strep-HRP was added to the strip
wells and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature.
The wells were washed again as before. Equal volumes
of PeroxyGlow A and B were combined and added to
the wells and chemiluminescent readings were obtained
immediately using a plate-reader.
