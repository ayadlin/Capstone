ABSTRACT
Tumor biomarkers including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor
(PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and Ki-67 are routinely
tested in breast cancer patients and their status guides clinical management and
predicts prognosis. A few retrospective studies have suggested that neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer may change the status of biomarker expression,
which in turn will affect further management of these patients. In this study we take
advantage of a relatively large cohort and aim to study the effect of NAC on biomarker
expression and explore the impact of tumor size and lymph node involvement on
biomarker status changes. We collected 107 patients with invasive breast cancer who
received at least three cycles of NAC. We retrospectively performed and scored the
immunohistochemistry (IHC) of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67 using both the diagnostic
core biopsies before NAC and excisional specimens following NAC. HER2 gene status
was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for cases with IHC result of 2+. We
demonstrated that there was a significant decrease in expression of PR (P = 0.013)
and Ki-67 (P = 0.000) in post-NAC specimens compared to pre-NAC core biopsies. In
addition, cases with large tumor size (≥2cm) and cases with lymph node metastasis
were more frequently to have biomarker changes. Finally we studied cases with HER2
status changes after NAC treatments in detail and emphasized the nature of tumor
heterogeneity.

of NAC is to shrink tumor size, improve the chance
of surgical operation, and monitor tumor response to
chemotherapeutic agents. Its clinical value for predicting
pathologic complete response (pCR) and its effect on
tumor biology and biomarker expression, however, are not
fully understood [4, 5].
The measurement of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67 by IHC
has become the standard practice in clinical managements
of breast cancer patients. Their expression pattern has been
used clinically to guide therapy and predict survival. They

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer in women and is the leading cause of cancerrelated death amongst women worldwide. Chemotherapy
is an important treatment modality and has significantly
improved the survival of breast cancer patients. In
chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has
become a well-established approach to treat large-sized or
locally advanced breast cancer [1–3]. The main purpose

are also used as surrogate markers for subtype classification
in breast cancer. Retrospective studies have suggested that
the expression status of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67 may
differ between the initial diagnostic core biopsies and
excisional specimens after NAC [6, 7]. The changes of
these biomarkers have clinical significance as oncologists
need to make appropriate treatment adjustment according
to the status of these biomarkers. Thus a comparison of
biomarker changes before and after NAC treatment is
helpful for further clinical management and is also useful
for studying tumor biological behavior [8].
The mechanisms that mediate biomarker status
change in breast cancer are not fully understood and several
potential explanations are present. The initial core biopsy
for diagnosis is usually small in size and may mix with
non-tumoral tissue, interfering the interpretation of IHC
results. Second, tumor heterogeneity may play a role in the
discordance between core biopsy and excisional specimens
as the initial core biopsy may not be representative of the
whole tumor. Finally, the biomarker status change may be
caused by NAC, which selectively kill some sensitive tumor
cells and leave resistant clones behind.
Although the effect of NAC on biomarker
expression has been studied, the results were controversial.
While some studies have shown that NAC alters biomarker
expression, others did not show such effect [9]. In addition,

there is no study to investigate the relationship between
biomarker changes and various tumor parameters, such
as tumor size and nodal involvement. Finally although
tumor heterogeneity has been proposed as a potential
mechanism of biomarker change after NAC, there is no
study that elucidated this in detail. In this study, we aimed
to explore the NAC induced biomarker changes in a more
precise way. We evaluated the frequency of status changes
in each biomarker before and after NAC treatment. We
also investigated the impact of tumor size and the status
of lymph node on biomarker status change. In addition, we
studied five cases with HER2 discordance before and after
NAC treatment and aimed to emphasize the heterogeneity
nature of breast cancer.

RESULTS
The comparison of biomarker expression in core
biopsies and post-NAC excisional specimens
We retrospectively scored the IHC of ER, PR, HER2
and Ki-67 in core biopsies and surgical excisional specimens
of 107 breast cancer patients. Their clinicopathological
features are shown in Table 1. ER and PR status was
assessed following both H-score scoring method [10] and
the guidelines from American Society of Clinical Oncology

(ASCO) and College of American Pathologists(CAP) [11].
Among 107 NAC-treated cases, changes of ER, PR, and
HER2status were observed in 14%(15/107), 24.3%(26/107),
and 4.7% (5/107) cases respectively. We further compared
the ER and PR expression level between core biopsies and
post-NAC excisional specimens using H-score scoring
semi-quantitative method. A significant reduction of PR
expression (P = 0.013) was found in post-NAC tumors
when compared to the pre-NAC core specimens, while
no significant change was found for ER (P = 0.100) and
HER2 (P = 0.239) (Figure 1). By quantitative counting of
proliferative marker Ki-67, we found a significantly reduced
expression in post-NAC specimens (P = 0.000) (Figure 1).
The tumors were further classified into luminal A,
luminal B, HER2 amplified, triple negative, and luminalHER2 groups. A detailed comparison of biomarker status
changes in different molecular subtypes is summarized
in Table 2. Notably, no receptor status alternation was
observed in the triple negative group. Next we examined
the change of Ki-67 in different molecular subtypes. The
luminal B as well as Luminal-HER2 tumors showed a
significant reduction in Ki-67 expression after NAC while
no significant difference was found in the luminal A,
HER2 amplified or the triple negative tumors (Table 3).
There was no significant difference in ER, PR and HER2
expression before and after NAC treatment in all subtypes
(Supplementary Table S1).

The 107 breast carcinomas were further
stratified by tumor size, axillary lymph node status
and chemotherapy response (Miller and Payne (MP)
grading system). A significant decrease in PR and ER
expression was found in tumors greater than 2cm, but
not in tumors with smaller size. In terms of lymph node
status, we found a significant reduction of PR expression
in tumors with positive lymph node involvement,
while no difference was found in cases with negative
lymph node involvement. No significant changes were
found for HER2 status among all groups of the tumors.
Ki-67 was significantly decreased after NAC in all groups
except tumors without axillary node metastasis. Table 4
summarized biomarker changes in post-NAC excisional
specimens in relation to various clinicopathological
parameters.
We further divided breast carcinomas into
chemotherapy-resistant (CS) and chemotherapysensitive (CR) groups according to MP grading
system on the excisional specimens (detail in material
and methods). We found a significant reduction in
Ki-67expression in both CS and CR groups (Table 4).
No significant alterations were found for ER, PR and
HER2 expression.

Case study of HER2 intra-tumor heterogeneity

amplified HER2 after NAC treatment is rare, we therefore
studied the morphology as well as the IHC of this case
in detail. IHC showed variable HER2 expression with 3+
in some areas and 2+ in other areas (Figure 2). This was
confirmed by FISH which also showed obvious tumor
heterogeneity with HER2 gene cluster amplification in
the IHC 3+ areas, and dot amplification (HER2/CEP17
ratio = 3) in the IHC2+ components (Figure 3). Both ER
and PR protein expression was weaker in the HER2 3+
areas than HER2 2+ areas. After NAC, the IHC of HER2
was changed to 1+, along with increased ER and PR
expression (Figure  2).

Next we focus on cases with HER2 status alterations
after NAC. There were five cases with discordant results
between initial biopsies and the following excisional
specimens. HER2 expression changed from negative to
positive in two cases and from positive to negative in three
cases (Supplementary Table 2).
For two cases with HER2 from negative to positive,
both post-NAC samples showed low level of HER2
amplification with cell to cell variation. One case showed
a combination of three tumor components in the excisional
specimen: invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS, invasive
lobular carcinoma, and invasive micropapillary carcinoma.
The core biopsy was only composed of HER2 negative
invasive lobular carcinoma.
Of three cases with HER2 status from positive to
negative, two had HER2 protein of 2+ before NAC. FISH
test confirmed HER2 gene amplification at a low level
with cell to cell heterogeneity. For the third case, HER2
protein was altered from IHC3+ (positive) to IHC1+
(negative). FISH confirmed HER2 cluster amplification
in pre-NAC core biopsy, and negative HER2 (HER2/
CEP17 ratio = 1.41) after treatment. As the genetic loss of

DISCUSSION
NAC is frequently utilized to treat patients with
locally advanced breast cancer. Assessment of biomarker
changes after NAC treatment is critical for evaluation of
NAC efficiency and should be used to tailor the clinical
management for breast cancer patients. Changes of
biomarker status in breast cancer after NAC treatment have
been described in the literature [6, 12]. The mechanisms
mediating the changes of biomarker expression, however,
remain largely unknown. Whether these changes are due

to NAC treatment, tumor heterogeneity, sampling or
technical issues need to be clarified.
In the current study, we demonstrated that the
biomarker expression changed in a significant proportion
of patients who received NAC. Among ER, PR and HER2,
PR was most frequently altered, occurring in 24% of
cases after NAC. Our findings are consistent with other
previous reports [13, 14]. In this study we also evaluate the
relationship between PR loss and MP grade and we found
that there was no significant correlation between PR loss
and MP grade. The significance of biomarker alternation
in breast cancer has been studied in few studies. In a
prospective study of 423 breast cancer patients by Jin et
al., alteration in hormone receptor status after NAC was
an independent prognostic factor for worse disease-free
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) [15]. It is well
known that ER+/PR− tumors had a higher level of growth
signaling than ER+/PR+ tumors [16]. PR loss may reflect
a relatively poor response to chemotherapy and may be
associated with a poor prognosis [17, 18].
According to gene expression profiling and
immunophenotypic pattern, breast cancer can be further
classified into different biologic subtypes: luminal A
(ER+/PR+/HER2–, Ki67 < 14%), luminal B (ER+/PR+/
HER2–, Ki67 ≥ 14%), luminal-HER2 (ER+/PR+/HER2+),
HER2+ (ER–/PR–/HER2+), and triple negative (ER–/
PR–/HER2–). These subtypes are associated with different
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

clinical outcomes. In our study, we analyzed biomarker
changes in different subgroups. None of the studied
biomarkers were changed in the triple negative group of
tumors, while luminal-HER2 subgroup showed the most
frequently altered biomarker status after NAC treatment
(Table 2).
Besides the classification of breast cancer
into five groups based on gene expression profiling
as described above, recent studies took a different
approach and classify breast cancer based on genomic
alterations. Three genetic categories were identified;
“simplex” type characterized by a few genomic
rearrangements; “complex sawtooth” characterized by
more rearrangements and gene copy number alterations;
“complex firestorm” characterized by high intensity of
gene amplification profiles limited to single chromosome
arms [19]. Luminal A type correlates with the simplex
profile such as gain of 1q and loss of 16q [20]. In luminal
A tumors, the frequency of ER and PR positive cells are
nearly 100% and their expression is homogeneously
strong. A large portion of IHC HER2 3+ tumors showed
HER2 gene cluster amplification by FISH. This type of
breast tumor is probably related to “complex firestorm”
profile. For luminal-HER2 subtype, we believe this type
of tumor might be more heterogeneous and is related
to “complex sawtooth” profile, which correlates with
genomic instability and the potential to bypass the

chemotherapy treatment. Consistently we found this
subtype is most commonly to have biomarker changes
(Table 2).
In this study, we also assessed whether there is
a relationship between biomarker changes and tumor
parameters, such as tumor size and lymph node status.
We found a decreased PR and ER expression in tumors
with large size (>2 cm) (Table 4). In addition, tumors
with nodal involvement were more frequent to have
decreased PR expression (Table 4). The rationale behind
these findings is at least partially attributable to the tumor
heterogeneity. It is plausible to state that large tumors
are more variable from areas to areas and thus the initial
core biopsy specimen is less likely to represent the whole
tumor. Also as tumor grows and metastasizes to lymph
nodes, microenvironment change and clonal evolution
occur, which enhance the tumor heterogeneity.
The breast cancer heterogeneity is clearly
demonstrated in our study (Figure 2 & 3). Of note,
two specific aspects of tumor heterogeneity should be
emphasized: morphological heterogeneity and molecular
profiling heterogeneity. It is obviously easy to recognize
morphological heterogeneity, such as a breast cancer
composed of invasive ductal carcinoma and micropapillary carcinoma. But for the heterogeneity at molecular
level, it is much more difficult to detect and currently there
is no standard guideline to measure and report molecular
heterogeneity. In our study, for the case with HER2
from 3+ to 1+ after NAC, there was no heterogeneity at
morphological level. However, at molecular level, the
tumor was heterogeneous. As shown in Figure 2, more
than 50% of tumors cells showed HER2 staining of 3+,
along with reduced ER and PR expression, while the rest
of the tumor showed moderate HER2 protein expression
(2+) accompanied with higher expression of ER and
PR. FISH result further confirmed HER2 gene cluster
amplification in IHC 3+ areas, and dot amplification in
IHC 2+ tumor components (Figure 3). So for this case,
it is a heterogeneous tumor composed of two subtypes;
HER2 amplification subtype and luminal-HER2 subtype.
Currently there is no standardized therapy for breast
cancers with molecular heterogeneity, but it is plausible
to propose that this kind of breast cancer should be treated
differently and combined therapeutic regimens may be
needed. Of note, the current IHC reporting system for
HER2 and hormone receptor is based on overall expression
of the whole tumor. In our study, we demonstrated tumor
heterogeneity is present in some breast cancer cases. We
suggested that intra-tumoral variability should be taken
into consideration when reporting biomarker results.
We propose that if there is tumor heterogeneity, all
components and their corresponding percentages should
be listed in the pathology report.
Some studies showed that amplification of
HER2 in breast-cancer cells is associated with clinical
responsiveness to anthracycline-containing chemotherapy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[21–23] such as CAF (cyclophosphamide, adramycine and
5-FU). In our study, one case (shown in Figure 2 & 3) was
treated with four cycles of CAF. After chemotherapy, HER
status changed from IHC3+ (positive) to IHC1+ (negative)
and correspondingly, the molecular subtype changed
from a luminal-HER2 to a luminal molecular subtype.
We proposed that the HER2 cluster amplified tumor cells
(luminal-HER2) were sensitive to the chemotherapeutic
drugs and killed by chemotherapy while tumor cells
without HER2 amplification survived.
In summary, our data showed a significant decrease
in PR and Ki-67 expression in post-NAC tumors when
compared to pre-NAC core biopsies. And for the first time,
we reported that larger tumors (≥2cm) and lymph node
metastatic breast cancers were more frequently to have
those biomarker changes. Moreover, we emphasized that
clonal heterogeneity should be taken into consideration
when interpreting biomarker expression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
One hundred and seven patients with invasive
ductal breast carcinomas diagnosed from 2011 to 2013
at Shandong University Qilu hospital were enrolled into
this study. Each patient received at least three cycles of
NAC. All tissue slides from core biopsies and surgical
excisions were reviewed by two experienced pathologists
(MK and YHQ). Axillary lymph node status was collected
retrospectively (Supplementary Table S3). Tumor size
were measured grossly, and confirmed under microscope.
The response to NAC was assessed by two pathologists
independently according to MP grading system. This
grading system is based on the reduction of tumor; from
MP 1 with no reduction in overall cellularity to MP 5 with
no residual malignant cells identified [24, 25]. Grade 1
and grade 2 were regarded as chemotherapy-resistant
(CR), and grade 3 to grade 5 tumors were classified as
chemotherapy-sensitive (CS) group [24]. All protocols
follow the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration
and were approved by Shandong University Research
Ethics Committee.

Immunohistochemistry
All the samples were fixed with 10% (volume/
volume) neutral-buffered formalin overnight following
CAP protocols and then embedded in paraffin. From each
specimen, 5 contiguous 4 μm sections were prepared
and used for HE staining and IHC of ER, PR, HER2 and
Ki-67. Immunostaining was performed using the Roche
Benchmark XT automated slide preparation system
(Roche Ltd, Switzerland) following the ultra view DAB
v3 procedure with appropriate positive and negative
controls.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and
assessment of HER2 gene heterogeneity

The Wilcoxon test for paired data was used to compare
biomarker changes after NAC. P-value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

FISH was conducted for selected tumors using the
PathVysion HER2 DNA Probe kit (Abbott-Vysis Lab,
Abbott Park, IL, USA) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Two pathologists reviewed the HE and HER2
IHC slides, and marked those cases with heterogeneity
at morphological level or at protein level (IHC). For
cases with positive tumor heterogeneity, at least 3 tissue
spots were counted for the heterogeneity assessment by
two pathologists. Each spot was counted for at least 20
nuclei according to ASCO/CAP guideline 2013. A tumor
was considered homogeneous if all counted tissue spots
showed identical results, while others were considered
HER2 gene heterogeneous.

Scoring methods
The IHC of ER and PR was evaluated independently
by two pathologists (MK and YHQ) in a blind manner. 3–5
non-overlapping fields (400 × ) per biopsy were examined.
For reproducibility, all of the cores were evaluated twice to
confirm the consistency of the results. ER and PR status was
assessed by H-score scoring method which takes both the
intensity and proportion of positive cells into consideration.
The intensity of staining was scored and graded on a 0–3
scale, with no staining = 0, weak staining = 1+, moderate
staining = 2+ and strong staining = 3+. The H-score provides
an overall score (0–300) based on the sum of positive
percentiles of tumor cells. The formula of calculating
H-score is: ((1 × % +) + (2 × % ++) + (3 × % +++)).
In parallel, according to the ASCO and CAP guidelines, ≥
1% positive tumor cells were counted as ER or PR positive.
HER2 scoring was performed according to
HercepTest criteria with negative (0 and 1+), equivocal
(2+), and positive (3+) [25]. Tumors were considered
HER2 positive if immunostaining was scored as 3+.
HER2/CEP17 ratio more than 2.0 or HER2/per cell
more than 6 was also considered HER2 positive. For the
amplification cases, those with HER2/CEP17 ≥ 4.0 or
HER2 ≥ 10.0 copies per nucleus were regarded as highlevel amplification. Cases with HER2/CEP17, 2.0–4.0 or
HER2, 6–10 copies per nucleus were regarded as low-level
amplification [26, 27]. The cut-off point of 14% for Ki67positive cells was used to distinguish low proliferation and
high proliferation tumors.
All the tumors were classified according to the
biomarker status before NAC: luminal A (ER+/PR+/HER2 −
/Ki67 < 14%), luminal B (ER+/PR+/HER2 − /Ki67 ≥ 14%),
HER2amplified (ER − /PR − /HER2+), triple negative (ER
− /PR − /HER2 − ), and luminal-HER2 (ER+/PR+/HER2+).
