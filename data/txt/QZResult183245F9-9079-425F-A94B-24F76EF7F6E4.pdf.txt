ABSTRACT
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) including axitinib have been introduced in the
treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) because of their anti-angiogenic properties.
However, no evidence are presently available on a direct cytotoxic anti-tumor activity
of axitinib in RCC.
Herein we reported by western blot analysis that axitinib treatment induces a
DNA damage response (DDR) initially characterized by γ-H2AX phosphorylation and
Chk1 kinase activation and at later time points by p21 overexpression in A-498 and
Caki-2 RCC cells although with a different potency. Analysis by immunocytochemistry
for the presence of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2’-deoxyguanosine in cellular DNA and flow
cytometry using the redox-sensitive fluorescent dye DCFDA, demonstrated that DDR
response is accompanied by the presence of oxidative DNA damage and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation. This response leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest
and induces a senescent-like phenotype accompanied by enlargement of cells and
increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, which are abrogated by
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) pre-treatment. In addition, axitinib-treated cells undergo to
cell death through mitotic catastrophe characterized by micronucleation and abnormal
microtubule assembly as assessed by fluorescence microscopy.
On the other hand, axitinib, through the DDR induction, is also able to increase
the surface NKG2D ligand expression. Accordingly, drug treatment promotes NK cell
recognition and degranulation in A-498 RCC cells in a ROS-dependent manner.
Collectively, our results indicate that both cytotoxic and immunomodulatory
effects on RCC cells can contribute to axitinib anti-tumor activity.

INTRODUCTION

Angiogenesis is critical for sustaining RCC growth
and haematogenous dissemination [4]. Tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) targeting vascular endothelial growth

been sequentially approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) [5-12].
Axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of
VEGFR 1, 2, and 3 approved by FDA in 2012 for the
treatment of patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) after
failure of one prior systemic therapy. The European
Medicines Agency has approved the use of axitinib in
2015 for the treatment of advanced renal carcinoma after
failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or interleukin 2
(IL-2) [13]. Its use as first-line therapy for advanced or
mRCC was also reported [14, 15].
In experimental models, axitinib produces a dosedependent blockade of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation,
reduction of vascular permeability and angiogenesis, and
induction of apoptosis, providing evidence for therapeutic
potential [16]. Moreover, in murine RCC xenografts,
axitinib augments CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor activity
against renal carcinoma via a STAT3-dependent reversal
of myeloid suppressor cells (MDSC) accumulation in the
spleens and tumor beds [17].
Agents that cause genotoxic stress or DNAreplication inhibitors have been recently shown to activate
the DNA damage response (DDR) as well as to increase
the expression of stress-induced NKG2D and DNAX
accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1) ligands recognized
by the innate immune system [18]. DDR to genotoxic
insults involves a class of protein kinases, including ATM,
ATR, and DNA-dependent protein kinases, followed by
activation of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases that causes temporal
cell cycle arrest, and promotes assembly of DNA repair
complexes at the damaged sites on chromosomes [19-21].
In vivo activation of Chk1 requires phosphorylation on
both Ser-345 and Ser-317 [22]. Cell cycle arrest can then
lead to different cellular programs including senescence,
apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe [23, 24].
Beyond its effects on angiogenesis, axitinib has
been recently shown to modulate the function of immune
effector cells that play an important role in the control of
RCC development, progression and drug response [25,26].
RCC exhibits a prominent immune cell infiltrate consisting
of T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and natural
killer (NK) cells.
NK cells represent one of the main effectors of
the immunosurveillance against tumors [27, 28]. NK
cell activity depends on the interplay between inhibitory
receptors for major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I molecules and activating receptors, such as
NKG2D and DNAM-1 that operate in concert to induce
the elimination of tumor cells [29, 30]. Human NKG2D
belongs to C-type lectin-like receptor family and
recognizes MHC I-related molecules MICA/B and ULBPs
(UL16-binding proteins) [31-33]. NKG2D is expressed
not only on NK cells, but also on γδ T cells, CD8+ T cells,
and a subset of CD4+ T cells. The expression of NKG2D
ligands is largely confined to virus-infected, tumor,
and stressed cells [31]. DNAM-1 is a transmembrane
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

glycoprotein constitutively expressed on the majority of
T cells, NK cells, and macrophages. DNAM-1 ligands,
namely nectin-2 (Nec-2, CD112) and the poliovirus
receptor (PVR, CD155), have been initially described
as adhesion molecules and only recently they have been
found on a variety of tumors and virus-infected cells [3335].
In this study, we demonstrated the ability of axitinib
treatment to trigger DNA damage response, cell cycle
arrest and senescence, and mitotic catastrophe in RCC
cells. In addition, we further evaluated axitinib ability to
increase NKG2D and DNAM-1 ligand surface expression
and to enhance NK cell recognition and activity against
RCC cells.

RESULTS
Axitinib inhibits RCC cell viability in a dose and
time-dependent manner
We first evaluated the effects of axitinib on cell
viability in A-498 and Caki-2 RCC lines by performing
dose-response and time-course analyses (Figure 1).
Axitinib inhibited the growth of RCC lines, with IC50
values of 13.6 µM for A-498 and 36 µM for Caki-2 cells
after 96 h of treatment, indicating that Caki-2 cells are
more resistant to axitinib-mediated cytotoxic effects.
The lowest effective dose of axitinib inducing growth
inhibition (12.5 μM for A-498 and 25 μM for Caki-2
cells after 96 h treatment) was used for the subsequent
experiments.

Axitinib triggers DDR associated with oxidative
DNA damage in RCC cells
To evaluate whether axitinib treatment could
trigger DDR in RCC cells, we initially investigated the
presence of γ-H2AX (H2AX), a phosphorylated variant
of histone 2A that is associated with DNA double-strand
breaks [36]. Interestingly, western blot analysis revealed
strong induction of the DNA damage marker in both RCC
cell lines, being more rapid and sustained in A-498 cells
(Figure 2A). γ-H2AX induction was accompanied by
Ser317- and Ser345-Chk1 phosphorylation already after 1
h exposure to axitinib and persisting at later points only in
A-498 cells (Figure 2B, 2C). Later at 12 h after treatment,
a progressive overexpression of p21 that paralleled the
decline of Ser345- and Ser317-Chk1 activation and Chk1
protein levels, was mainly observed in A-498 cells (Figure
2B, 2C).
In addition, immunofluorescence analysis with
8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), a
marker of oxidative DNA damage [37], in cells treated
for different times with axitinib alone or in combination

more rapid and prominent in A-498 cells (Figure 3A); this

decrease of G0/G1 phase cell population already at 6
h and this decrease was accompanied by a parallel and
progressive increase of G2/M-phase cell population
until 72 h (Figure 4A). Again, the axitinib effects were
more potent in A-498 cells as compared to Caki-2 cells.
In addition, pre-treatment of RCC cells with NAC
reverted the axitinib-induced effects on cell cycle at any
experimental time point tested (Figure 4B, and data not

An accumulation of RCC cells with enlarged and
flattened morphology was observed at 48 h after axitinib
treatment by microscopy and biparametric (forward

We then evaluated whether axitinib treatment could
result in changes in cell cycle. Thus, we performed cell
cycle experiments in the presence of axitinib for 96 h. We
observed that treatment of RCC cells induced a significant

Axitinib induces mitotic catastrophe in RCC cells

(Supplementary Figure 1). Since these morphological
changes are reminiscent of a senescent phenotype,
we analyzed the presence of senescence-associated
β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, in axitinib-treated
cells [38,39]. Seventy-two hours after axitinib treatment,
increased levels of SA-β-gal activity were detected in RCC
cells stained with the fluorescent β-galactosidase substrate,
C12FDG as determined by flow cytometry. (Figure 5A).
Recent studies have suggested that reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generation by anticancer drug treatment can
stimulate cellular senescence [40]. Thus, we evaluated the
generation of ROS in RCC cells by flow cytometry using
the general redox-sensitive fluorescent dye, DCFDA.
As shown in Figure 5B, axitinib stimulated intracellular
generation of ROS that was evident at 24 h after exposure,
being more rapid and sustained in A-498 cells. These
results were also supported by cytochemical assessment
of SA-β-gal activity that revealed a significant reduction
in the percentage of blu-stained axitinib-treated senescent
cells after pretreatment with NAC (Figure 5C).

Mitotic catastrophe is a non-apoptotic cell death
resulting from cell cycle arrest and abnormal mitosis,
usually ending in the formation of large cells with multiple
micronuclei [41]. Thus we decided to study whether
axitinib treatment could also result in mitotic catastrophe
in RCC cells, by assessing the changes in nuclear
morphology using Hoechst 33258 staining. Increased
number of micronuclei was observed at 96 h in both
RCC cell lines (Figure 6A). In addition, by examining
the expression of α-tubulin, abnormal microtubule
assembly was found in axitinib-treated RCC cells at 96
h after treatment (Figure 6B). To further support mitotic
catastrophe as the mode of death, FITC-conjugated
Annexin V/PI and cytofluorimetric analysis, agarose gel
electrophoresis for DNA fragmentation and western blot
analysis for caspase-3 activity were performed in untreated
or axitinib-treated cells. Axitinib treatment resulted in an
increased percentage of cells undergoing necrotic-like
death (Annexin V-/PI+) and secondary necrosis (Annexin
V+/PI+) upon drug exposure in both RCC cell lines, being

the frequency of dead cells higher and the cell death
program more advanced in A-498 cells as compared
to Caki-2 cells (Figure 6C); moreover, neither DNA
fragmentation (Figure 6D) or caspase-3 activation (Figure
6E) was evidenced in axitinib-treated RCC cells.
Taken together, these results indicate that axitinib
induces cell death in RCC cells through mitotic
catastrophe.

cell lines constitutively express MICA and ULBP family
NKG2D ligands, and PVR and nectin-2 DNAM-1 ligands,
but with a different profile (Figure 7A). Seventy-two
hour treatment of RCC cells with axitinib induced MICB
expression in A-498 cells, and increased the expression of
ULBP1 and MICA in Caki-2 cells, respectively (Figure
7A). In addition, down-regulation of nectin-2 and PVR
DNAM-1 ligands was observed in Caki-2 cells upon drug
exposure (Figure 7A). Moreover, we found that MICB
was preferentially expressed on FDG-positive A-498
cells undergoing senescence as demonstrated by double
immunofluorescence and flow cytometry (Figure 7B).
We next investigated the expression of MICB,
MICA and ULBP1 on PI- A-498 and Caki-2 RCC cells,
respectively, in the presence of anti-oxidant NAC.
Exposure of RCC cells to NAC resulted in complete
inhibition of MICB and ULBP1 expression in A-498 and
Caki-2 cells, respectively (Figure 8A and 8B), whereas
NAC pretreatment did not significantly reduce axitinibinduced increase of MICA expression on Caki-2 cells that
exhibited a weaker oxidative stress response.

Axitinib preferentially increases NKG2D ligand
expression in senescent RCC cells
Since chemotherapeutic agents through the
activation of the DDR have been shown to enhance the
expression of NKG2D and DNAM-1 ligands on human
multiple myeloma cells in a ROS-dependent manner [18],
we investigated whether axitinib treatment could modulate
the expression of the ligands for NKG2D and DNAM-1
activating NK receptors on A-498 and Caki-2 RCC lines,
and the involvement of ROS signaling in this event. To this
aim we firstly evaluated the basal expression of NKG2D
(MICA, MICB, ULBP1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and DNAM-1 (PVR
and nectin-2) ligands on A-498 and Caki-2 RCC cells by
immunofluorescence and cytofluorimetric analysis. Both

Enhanced NK cell degranulation upon interaction
with axitinib-treated A-498 RCC cells

healthy donors contacting axitinib treated-RCC target
cells, revealed that drug-treated A-498 RCC cells more
efficiently triggered NK cell degranulation as compared
to untreated cells, and this enhancement is completely
blocked by NAC pretreatment, in parallel with inhibition
of MICB induction (Figure 9). Conversely, no significative
changes in CD107a expression were observed on NK cells
contacting axitinib-treated Caki-2 cells (Supplementary
Figure 2), likely attributable to the lower responsiveness
of these cells to the axitinib-exerted activity.

Based on these findings, we evaluated whether
axitinib would increase NK cell degranulation upon
interaction with drug-treated RCC cells. The expression
of the lysosomal marker CD107a, which correlates
with NK cell cytotoxicity [42] was evaluated by
immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis by
gating on CD56+ human peripheral blood NK cells
contacting treated or untreated RCC cells used as target.
The expression of CD107a on NK cells from two different

DISCUSSION

was observed and paralleled decreased levels of Chk1
activation and depletion. In this regard, reactivation of a
senescence program in PC-3 prostate cancer cells upon a
retrovirus-mediated transduction of p21, was described to
suppress Chk1 activation [43].
We also investigated the involvement of redox
signaling on the ability of axitinib treatment to induce
cellular senescence in A-498 and Caki-2 RCC cells. We
found that drug exposure increases ROS generation and
induces the DNA oxidation, whereas pretreatment with the
antioxidant agent NAC results in impaired cell cycle arrest
and decreased percentage of SA-β-gal positive cells.
Similarly to our study, treatment of gastric cancer
cells with axitinib was reported to induce a senescent
phenotype characterized by increased cell size, expression
of SA-β-galactosidase and arrest in G2 cell cycle phase

TKIs and in particular axitinib have been recently
approved for the treatment of advanced mRCC, mainly
for their anti-angiogenic properties. Herein, we provide
evidence indicating that axitinib anti-tumor activity can
be also the result of its ability to induce DDR, cellular
senescence and mitotic catastrophe, and to enhance the
recognition of RCC cells by innate immune effector cells
through the modulation of activating ligands.
In particular, we found that treatment of RCC with
suboptimal doses of axitinib triggers a DDR evidenced
by increased levels of H2AX, Ser317- and Ser345-Chk1
phosphorylation and DNA oxidation, leading to cell cycle
arrest at G2/M phase and cellular senescence. At later
time points, overexpression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21

[44].

ROS signaling as ligand up-regulation was susceptible to
NAC pretreatment. By contrast, in Caki-2 cells pretreated
with NAC, no reversal of axitinib-induced increase of
MICA expression was evident. Moreover, in accordance
with previous evidence indicating that NKG2D and
DNAM-1 ligand are expressed on tumor cells with
senescent phenotype upon treatment with genotoxic
agents [52], we found a preferential expression of MICB
on axitinib-treated senescent A-498 RCC cells. Like
axitinib, other TKIs such as sorafenib and sunitinib have
been described to induce the expression of MICA/B in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells [53], but their association
with a senescent phenotype was not reported.
As far as the mechanisms underlying axitinibinduced MICB expression, a role for Signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibition can be
envisaged based on the recent evidences demonstrating
that axitinib can stimulate anti-tumor immunity by downregulating the STAT3 expression in Renca RCC cells
[54], and MICA/B expression on cancer cells induced
by genotoxic stress is enhanced by inhibition of STAT3
activity [55].
Our results also show increased degranulation
activity in NK cells contacting axitinib-treated A-498 but
not Caki-2 RCC cells. The failure of axitinib-treated Caki2 cells to promote NK cell degranulation as compared
to A-498 RCC cells may depend on the less potent and
sustained DDR induced by axitinib in this tumor cell
line. In addition, this result may be related to the druginduced down-regulation of DNAM-1 ligand expression
observed in these cells leading to lack of cooperative
signals required for the triggering of NK cell cytotoxic
program [56].

Cell cycle arrest and senescence are often associated
with mitotic catastrophe. Chk1, the kinase that regulates
the G2/M checkpoint, is also particularly important
for preventing mitotic catastrophe in cells treated with
DNA-damaging agents [45-47]. Mitotic catastrophe has
been described as the main form of cell death induced by
anticancer drugs [48, 49]. Similarly to necrosis, mitotic
catastrophe shows early loss of plasma membrane
integrity, with large cells containing uncondensed
chromosomes [50]. Treatment with axitinib caused an
increased frequency of cells undergoing necrotic-like
death and secondary necrosis as well as mitotic catastrophe
characterized by multinucleation, abnormal microtubule
assembly, early membrane permeabilization and absence
of apoptotic features such as caspase 3 activation and
DNA fragmentation.
Our study provides also evidence that axitinib
treatment increases the surface expression of stressinduced ligands recognised by innate immune effector
cells.
Up-regulation of stress-inducible NK-cell activating
ligands is preferentially associated with the onset of a
senescent phenotype and arrest in the G2 phase of the cell
cycle [51]. Our findings demonstrate that A-498 and Caki2 RCC cells constitutively express, although at different
levels, several NKG2D and DNAM-1 ligands. Axitinib
treatment induced MICB expression in A-498 RCC cells
and increased ULBP1 and MICA expression in Caki-2
cells. In addition in these latter cells, significative downregulation of the DNAM-1 ligand PVR was observed.
We also demonstrated that induction of MICB on
A-498 RCC cells and ULBP-1 on Caki-2 cells requires

Collectively, our findings are consistent with
previous evidence describing RCC susceptibility to
NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and the presence of a
high frequency of NK cells in the lymphocytic infiltrate
of RCC predicting a better prognosis [57]. Moreover,
interleukin-2 (IL-2) in combination with infusion of IL-2activated NK and LAK cells has been widely employed as
immunotherapeutic approach for RCC patients [58].
Based on these findings, the use of axitinib
in sequential or combined strategies with other
immunotherapic approaches, such as anti-programmed
death-1 (PD-1) or PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) agents, should
be tested in prospective clinical trials. At this regard, a
phase I study is in course to assess the safety of axitinib
in combination with avelumab (MSB0010718C), an
anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with advanced RCC
(NCT02493751).
Taken together, our study first demonstrate that
axitinib not only inhibits angiogenesis, but it can exert
direct genotoxic effects on RCC cells by inducing cell
cycle arrest and mitotic catastrophe, and activating a
cellular senescence program. This direct cytotoxic effect
of axitinib in RCC cells may partially explain the relevant
gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity of this agent
[12].
In addition, axitinib can also display an immunemediated antitumor activity by promoting NK cellmediated recognition and elimination of RCC through
the regulation NK activating ligand expression. A better
dissection of the functions of immune cells in RCC
microenvironment and of the immune-modulatory effects
of TKIs will be crucial to optimize immunotherapeutic
approaches in RCC advanced patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell line culture and treatment

MTT assay

Human kidney cancer (Caki-2 and A-498) cell
lines were purchased from Cell bank Interlab Cell
Line Collection (ICLC, Italy) and cultured at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Caki-2 cells were
cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium (Lonza Bioresearch,
Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2mM L-glutamine
and 100 IU/ml of penicillin, 100 µg of streptomycin
(Lonza). A-498 cells were cultured in EMEM medium
(Lonza) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated
FBS 2mM L-glutamine and 100 IU/ml of penicillin, 100
µg of streptomycin and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Lonza).
A-498 and Caki-2 cells were treated with different
doses of axitinib (1, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0 and 100
µM) for different times. In some experiments Caki-2 and
A-498 cells were pretreated for 1 h with 10 mM of NAC,

The colorimetric MTT assay was used to evaluate
the cell viability. Three x105 RCC cells/ml were seeded
into 96-well plates and cultured with different doses of
axitinib for up to 96 h. At the end of treatment, 0.8 mg/
ml of MTT was added to the samples and incubated for
3 h. Then the supernatants were discarded and coloured
formazan crystals dissolved with 100 μl/well of DMSO,
were read by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, USA). Four
replicates were used for each treatment.

to 72 h. Cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol
and then washed with staining buffer (PBS, 2% FBS and
0.01% NaN3). Next, the cells were treated with 100 μg/
ml ribonuclease A solution, incubated for 30 min at 37°C,
stained for 30 min at room temperature with PI 20 μg/
ml and finally analysed by flow cytometry using linear
amplification.

the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the population.

Annexin V and PI staining
Cell death was evaluated using Annexin V-FITC
and PI staining followed by biparametric FACS analysis.
Three x105 A-498 and Caki-2 RCC cells were treated with
axitinib or with vehicle for up to 96 h. The percentage of
positive cells determined over 10,000 events was analyzed
on a FACScan cytofluorimeter using the CellQuest
software.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1M Tris pH 7.4, 1
M NaCl, 10 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaF, 100 mM Na V0,
100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2% deoxycholate,
100 mM EDTA, 10% Triton X-l00, 10% glycerol, 10%
SDS, 0.1 M Na4 P2 07) containing protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) by using a Mixer Mill MM300
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Lysates were separated on
SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Hybond-C
extra membranes (GE Healthcare). Membrane were
incubated overnight at 4°C in primary Abs (anti-caspase 3
1:100; anti-H2AX 1:1000, anti-Chk1-Ser345 1:1000, antiChk1-Ser317 1:1000, anti-Chk1 1:1000, anti-p21 1:300),
followed by the incubation (room temperature, 1 h) with
HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary Abs.
Peroxidase activity was visualized with the LiteAblot
®PLUS (EuroClone, Milan, Italy) kit and densitometric
analysis was carried out by a Chemidoc using the Quantity
One software (Bio-Rad).

DNA fragmentation assay
RCC cells were treated as above described for up
to 96 h, and genomic DNA was extracted using a DNA
extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified samples were then
subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.25% agarose gel, and
DNA was stained with ethidium bromide. Ultraviolet
spectroscopy at 302 nm was used to obtain the results.

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production
Cells were cultured for up to 96 h with axitinib or
vehicle. Cells were washed with PBS, pulsed with DCFDA
for 10 min at 37°C, 5% CO2, and analyzed by FACScan
cytofluorimeter using the CellQuest software.

Senescence analysis

α-Tubulin and nuclei staining

We performed the senescence analysis by both
microscope and flow cytometry. RCC cells were
treated with axitinib or vehicle before performing the
senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) assay.
Cells were then fixed for 5 min at room temperature
in 3% formaldehyde and incubated overnight at 37°C
without CO2 with fresh SA-β-Gal stain solution: 1
mg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside
(X-Gal), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 40 mM citric
acid, 5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 5 mM potassium
ferrocyanide, and 5 mM potassium ferricyanide. Senescent
cells were identified as blue-stained cells by standard light
microscopy. Photographs were acquired and analyzed
by an Olympus BX51 microscope (Hamburg, Germany)
using magnification 40x.
Relatively to flow cytometry, we performed the
assay using the fluorogenic substrate C12FDG. Drugtreated cells were incubated 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2
with 100 nM bafilomycin A1 in culture medium to induce
lysosomal alkalinization at pH 6 and, then, for 1 h with 33
μM C12FDG. Samples were immediately analyzed using
FACScan cytofluorimeter using the CellQuest software.
The C12-fluorescein signal was measured on the FL-1
detector, and β-galactosidase activity was estimated using

Cells cultured as above described were fixed in 2%
formaldehyde and 0.5% triton X-100 for 10 min at room
temperature and then in 4% formaldehyde and 0.5% triton
X-100 for 10 min. To examine the expression of α-tubulin,
fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Tween-20/3%
BSA, and stained with mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody
(1:50). Cells were further incubated with Alexa-594conjugated GAM (1:100). For nuclei analysis, cells were
fixed in Carnoy’s fixative (1:3 glacial acetic acid: absolute
methanol) and stained with 0,05 μg/ml Hoechst 33258.
Stained cells were examined by using the Olympus BX51
microscope.

Immunofluorescence and microscopic analysis
For immunofluorescence analysis, RCC cells were
fixed with 1:1 MeOH, acetone for 20 min at -20°C and
labeled with anti-8-hydroxyguanine (8-oxo-dG) antibody
(1:250) diluted in 1X PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.01%
Tween 20 at 4°C o/n in a humidified chamber according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were further incubated
with Alexa-594-conjugated GAM (1:100). Photographs
were acquired and analyzed by an Olympus BX51

NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was evaluated using
the degranulation lysosomal marker CD107a as described
[42]. As source of effector cells freshly purified NK cells
were used. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were separated from buffy coats of healthy donors
by Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) gradient
centrifugation. Freshly isolated NK cells were then isolated
from PBMC by negative selection using a magnetically
activated cell sorter NK isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bologna, Italy). This purification protocol resulted in
a purity of more than 95% of negatively selected NK
cells. After 72 h treatment with axitinib, RCC cells were
incubated with NK cells at effector:target (E:T) ratios
of 1:1 in a flat-bottom 96-well tissue culture plate in
complete medium. In some experiments axitinib-treated
where exposed to NAC (10 mM, for 1 h). The plates were
then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 2 h.
Thereafter, cells were incubated with anti-CD107a/APC
(or cIgG/APC) for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were also stained
with anti-CD56/PE to gate NK cell population.
