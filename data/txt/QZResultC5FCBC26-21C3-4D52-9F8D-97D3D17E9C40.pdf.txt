Abstract

Author Manuscript

The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) inhibits both cell division and apoptosis, but the mechanism by
which Rb alternatively regulates these divergent outcomes remains poorly understood. Cyclin
dependent kinases (Cdks) promote cell division by phosphorylating and reversibly inactivating Rb
by a hierarchical series of phosphorylation events and sequential conformational changes. The
stress-regulated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 also phosphorylates Rb, but it does
so in a cell cycle-independent manner that is associated with apoptosis rather than with cell
division. Here, we show that p38 phosphorylates Rb by a novel mechanism that is distinct from
that of Cdks. p38 bypasses the cell cycle-associated hierarchical phosphorylation and directly
phosphorylates Rb on Ser567, which is not phosphorylated during the normal cell cycle.
Phosphorylation by p38, but not Cdks, triggers an interaction between Rb and the human
homologue of murine double minute 2 (Hdm2), leading to degradation of Rb, release of E2F1 and
cell death. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how Rb regulates cell division
and apoptosis through different kinases, and reveal how Hdm2 may functionally link the tumor
suppressors Rb and p53.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Rb functions as a tumor suppressor in part by inhibiting cell division (Goodrich et al, 1991;
Knudsen et al, 1998). In order for cells to divide, Rb is temporarily inactivated by Cdks,
which phosphorylate Rb at up to 16 Ser/Thr-Pro phospho-acceptor sites, thereby allowing
cells to traverse from G1 into S phase (Chen et al, 1989; Hinds et al, 1992; Lin et al, 1991;

Lundberg & Weinberg, 1998; Serrano et al, 1993). Most tumors co-opt this mechanism and
maintain Rb in a partially hyperphosphorylated state, often by constitutive activation of
Cdks or inactivation of Cdk inhibitors such as p16Ink4a (Sherr & McCormick, 2002). Rb also
inhibits apoptosis (Chau & Wang, 2003; Harbour & Dean, 2000), with loss of Rb leading to
p53-dependent and independent apoptosis in the nervous system, lens and melanocytes and
other tissues (Jacks et al, 1992; Lee et al, 1992; Macleod et al, 1996; Morgenbesser et al,
1994; Wu et al, 2003).

The anti-proliferative and anti-apoptotic functions of Rb can be biochemically uncoupled
and are both mediated largely through interactions with E2F transcription factors (E2Fs)
(Chau et al, 2006). E2Fs activate genes involved in cell division and apoptosis (Stevaux &
Dyson, 2002). Rb inhibits the E2F transactivation function by directly binding and masking
the transactivation domain and by recruiting chromatin remodeling factors to alter local
chromatin structure to an inhibitory state (Almasan et al, 1995; Chellappan et al, 1991;
Dyson, 1998; Hsieh et al, 1997; Irwin et al, 2000; Morgenbesser et al, 1994; Nevins, 1998;
Qin et al, 1994; Shan & Lee, 1994; Tsai et al, 1998). Phosphorylation of Rb was originally
thought to drive cell cycle progression simply by releasing E2Fs to activate cell cycle genes.
However, this model fails to explain how cells inactivate Rb and release E2Fs in order to
divide without also triggering apoptosis by activating E2F-bound pro-apoptotic genes.
Towards a potential explanation, recent observations suggest that Rb exists not only in fully
active and fully inactive forms, but rather, it can exist in multiple phosphorylation states that
have differing abilities to bind E2Fs and other proteins, and to inhibit cell division and
apoptosis (Lundberg & Weinberg, 1998; Ma et al, 2003; Ianari et al, 2009). Partially
phosphorylated forms of Rb bind E2Fs (Ezhevsky et al, 2001; Ezhevsky et al, 1997), and Rb
continues to co-localize with E2Fs at certain promoters in vivo beyond the G1/S transition
despite being sufficiently phosphorylated to allow for cell cycle progression (Wells et al,
2000; Wells et al, 2003). The different phosphorylated forms of Rb appear to allow the cell
to differentially control cell cycle genes and apoptotic genes, the former being derepressed
by partial phosphorylation of Rb and the latter being activated by more complete
phosphorylation of Rb (Young & Longmore, 2004; Young et al, 2003; Zhang et al, 2000).
Taken together, these observations indicate that the decision between proliferation and
apoptosis is made, at least in part, by the manner in which Rb is phosphorylated.

These findings raise a key question: if Cdks do not completely phosphorylate nor fully
inactivate Rb during the normal cell cycle, then under what physiologic conditions and by
what mechanism does complete inactivation of Rb and concomitant activation of apoptotic
genes occur? In recent years other kinases capable of phosphorylating Rb have been
identified, such as p38, which is activated during cellular stress and promotes apoptosis
(Wang et al, 1999; Nath et al, 2003; Hou et al, 2002). p38 has been shown to phosphorylate
Rb in response to stress and death receptor signaling in multiple cell types, such as
endothelial cells, cerebellar neurons, Jurkat lymphocytic cells, colon cancer cells, and
melanoma cells (Hou et al, 2002; Kishore et al, 2003; Lee et al, 2003; Nath et al, 2003;
Yeste-Velasco et al, 2009; Wang et al, 1999). Rather than promoting cell division,
phosphorylation of Rb by p38 appears to promote apoptosis under physiologic conditions of
cellular stress (Bowen et al, 2002). While the ability of p38 to phosphorylate Rb has been
firmly established, it remains unclear why p38 favors apoptosis whereas Cdks promote cell

division. One possibility is that p38 preferentially phosphorylates a different site or sites on
Rb that confer different biochemical and, thus, physiologic effects.
In this study, we sought to determine mechanistically how phosphorylation of Rb by p38
differs from that of Cdks and why this results in such a dramatically different physiologic
effect (apoptosis versus cell division, respectively). We show that residue Ser567 on Rb is
preferentially phosphorylated by p38, but not Cdk2, in response to genotoxic stress. This
phosphorylation triggers an interaction between Rb and Hdm2, which in turn leads to
degradation of Rb, release of E2Fs, and induction of apoptosis. This response to genotoxic
stress can be prevented by inhibition of p38. Our findings provide a potential mechanism
linking Hdm2 with the two tumor suppressors p53 and Rb in a tightly controlled cellular
response to genotoxic stress.

Results
Loss of Rb leads to apoptosis

Author Manuscript

Functional and reversible inactivation of Rb by Cdk-mediated hyper-phosphorylation, as
occurs during normal cell division and in most proliferating cancer cells, did not induce cell
death in melanoma cells (Figure 1A). In contrast, complete and irreversible inactivation of
Rb by RNAi-mediated depletion of the protein induced cell death both in the Mel202
melanoma cell line and in primary melanoma cells (Figure 1A-C). This is consistent with
previous work demonstrating that specifically knocking out Rb from melanocytes led to
melanocyte cell death (Yu et al, 2003). To explore why these mechanisms for inactivating
Rb that have been assumed to be functionally equivalent result in such strikingly different
phenotypic outcomes, we developed an experimental model system in which Rb degradation
and apoptosis were induced by genotoxic stress in Mel202 cells, which have been
extensively characterized and shown to be wildtype for Rb and p53 (Sun et al, 2005). At low
concentrations, the DNA damaging agent etoposide resulted in stabilization of p53,
hypophosphorylation of Rb, and cell cycle arrest as expected (data not shown) (Strobeck et
al, 2000; Valentini et al, 2007), but at slightly higher concentrations, etoposide induced
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1D-G). This apoptosis was accompanied by
hyperphosphorylation and degradation of Rb, with over half of the cellular Rb depleted by
72 h (Figure 1H-I). This effect was also seen in other cells such as primary human
melanocytes, OCM1A and 92.1uveal melanoma cells, A375 cutaneous melanoma cells,
MCF-7 and F-MB-231 breast cancer cells, U2OS osteosarcoma cells, and 10T/2 mouse
fibroblasts (data not shown).
Genotoxic stress triggers phosphorylation of Rb on Ser567 by p38

Author Manuscript

To determine which kinase catalyzes phosphorylation of Rb in response to this genotoxic
stress, we started by evaluating Cdks that phosphorylate Rb during cell division. Inhibitors
of Cdk2 and Cdk4 did not block Rb hyperphosphorylation induced by etoposide (Figure 2A
and Supplemental Figure 1A). This led us to hypothesize that p38, which is activated by
etoposide, might mediate this phosphorylation (Pillaire et al, 2000). Indeed, inhibition of
p38 with a specific inhibitor potently blocked Rb phosphorylation (Figure 2B) in response to
etoposide. Further, knock down of p38Î±, but not p38Î², by RNAi blocked the etoposide-

induced Rb phosphorylation (Figure 2C). Consistent with these findings, p38 underwent
activating phosphorylation in response to etoposide treatment (Figure 2D). Importantly,
chemical inhibition of p38 substantially reduced etoposide-induced apoptosis (Figure 2E-F).
Direct activation of endogenous p38 by adenoviral expression of the upstream effector
MKK3 (Ad-MKK3) triggered phosphorylation and degradation of Rb and induced apoptosis
in a manner that was indistinguishable from etoposide treatment (Figure 2G-I, 2K). In
contrast, activation of endogenous Cdk by adenoviral expression of cyclin D1 (Ad-cycD1)
did not induce phosphorylation or degradation of Rb and it did not result in a significant
increase in apoptosis (Figure 2H-I). A Ser567-phospho-specific Rb antibody showed that
this site was phosphorylated in cells in response to either etoposide treatment (Figure 2A-B)
or Ad-MKK3 (Figure 2G). Moreover, this phosphorylation could be blocked by a p38
inhibitor but not by Cdk inhibitors. We next wished to determine whether a mutant defective
in Ser567 phosphorylation would be resistant to stress-induced apoptosis. The Ser567
phosphoacceptor site is unique in that it mimics, rather than blocks, Ser567 phosphorylation,
so this mutant could not be used to assess how blocking Ser567 phosphorylation affects Rb
function. Instead, we previously generated an Rb mutant in which proline568 was
substituted with an alanine (RbÎ”568), and showed that this mutant remained partially active
while blocking Ser567 phosphorylation (Harbour et al, 1999; Ma et al, 2003). Ectopic
expression of RbÎ”568, but not wildtype Rb or an Rb mutant in which Ser780 was
substituted with an alanine preventing phosphorylation of Ser780 (RbÎ”780), inhibited
apoptosis in cells treated with etoposide (Figure 2J) and cells treated with Ad-MKK3
(Figure 2K), indicating that phosphorylation of Ser567 is specifically required for apoptosis.
p38 phosphorylates Rb on Ser567 by a mechanism distinct from Cdks

Author Manuscript

While p38 has been shown to phosphorylate Rb (Wang et al, 1999), it remains unclear
whether p38 phosphorylates Rb by the same mechanism previously shown for Cdks
involving a hierarchical series of conformational changes (Harbour et al, 1999). We
performed in vitro kinase experiments to confirm the ability of p38 to phosphorylate Rb
directly. Both recombinant p38Î± and endogenous p38, immunoprecipitated from melanoma
cells treated with etoposide, resulted in robust phosphorylation of Rb in vitro (Figure 3A).
As we showed previously (Harbour et al, 1999), cyclin E-Cdk2 can phosphorylate Rb on
Ser567 only in the presence of the phosphorylated Rb C-terminus, which provides a docking
site for Cdk2 and brings it into proximity of Ser567 following a series of hierarchical
conformational changes. In contrast, p38 did not require the C-terminus for efficient
phosphorylation of Ser567; instead, p38 phosphorylated this residue more efficiently in the
absence of the C-terminus (Figure 3B-C). This indicated that p38 phosphorylates Rb on
Ser567 through a unique mechanism unlike that of Cdks.

Phosphorylation of Rb by p38 disrupts the E2F1-Rb interaction and triggers E2F1mediated apoptosis
We reasoned that stress-related phosphorylation of Rb is unique in its ability to release E2Fs
that can then activate apoptotic genes, and that this could account for the apoptosis that
occurs when p38 phosphorylates Rb. To test this, we activated endogenous p38 in cells by
expressing MKK3, and used co-immunoprecipitation experiments to evaluate the interaction
between E2F1, one of the E2F family members involved in apoptosis, and ectopically

expressed Rb. As expected, phosphorylation of Rb by p38 disrupted the interaction between
Rb and E2F1 (Figure 4A). Concomitantly, the release of E2F1 from Rb repression by p38Î±
allowed it to activate E2F1-responsive promoters (Figure 4B). Further, RNAi-mediated
knock down of E2F1 inhibited Ad-MKK3-associated apoptosis, confirming that p38 induced
apoptosis, at least in part, through release of E2F1 (Figure 4C-D).
p53 plays a role in p38-mediated apoptosis, but not Rb phosphorylation

Author Manuscript

Recognizing that p53 is activated by etoposide as part of the DNA damage response (Lowe
et al, 1993), we wished to determine whether p53 was required for p38-mediated Rb
phosphorylation and/or apoptosis. Knock down of p53 by RNAi had no effect on etoposideinduced Rb hyperphosphorylation or degradation (Figure 5A), but it did inhibit etoposideinduced cell death (Figure 5C). Similar results were observed in Ad-MKK3 treated cells
(Figure 5B, 5D). These data indicate that p53 is not required for p38-mediated
hyperphosphorylation or degradation of Rb, but it is required to cooperate with p38 to
induce apoptosis in this setting (Figure 5C-D).
Phosphorylation of Rb on Ser567 by p38 triggers Hdm2-mediated Rb degradation and
apoptosis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In our experiments, genotoxic stress or activation of endogenous p38 with Ad-MKK3
resulted not only in hyperphosphorylation of Rb but also in a precipitous decline in total Rb
protein levels, suggesting that p38-mediated phosphorylation causes degradation of Rb
(Figure 1H-I). Although Rb has been shown previously to be cleaved by caspases under
certain conditions (Fattman et al, 2001; Fattman et al, 1997), we found that the pan-caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK could not block etoposide-induced Rb degradation (Supplemental
Figure 2). Other studies have shown that Rb can interact with the E3 ligase Hdm2, which
targets proteins such as Rb and p53 for proteosomal degradation, such that it can act as an
oncogene when overexpressed (Xiao et al, 1995; Sdek et al, 2004; Sdek et al, 2005). The
critical role played by Hdm2 in maintaining p53 at low cellular levels during normal
conditions has been firmly established (Momand et al, 1992; Oliner et al, 1993), but the
physiologic significance and mechanism of the Hdm2-Rb interaction remains less certain.
We hypothesized that Hdm2 mediates the degradation of Rb that occurs in response to p38mediated phosphorylation. Indeed, degradation of Rb was efficiently inhibited by a small
molecule inhibitor of Hdm2 E3 ligase activity (Figure 6A), and in co-immunoprecipitation
experiments, the interaction between Rb and Hdm2 was enhanced by activating endogenous
p38 either through etoposide or Ad-MKK3 treatment, but not by activating endogenous
Cdks through Ad-cycD1 treatment (Figure 6B-C). More specifically, Ad-MKK3, but not
Ad-cycD1, led to an increased interaction between Hdm2 hyperphosphorylated Rb (Figure
6C), and knock down of Hdm2 by RNAi led to an accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Rb
(Supplemental Figure 3A). Interestingly, treating cells with a proteosome inhibitor also
resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated Rb (Supplemental Figure 3B) revealing that a
low level of Rb degradation occurs in melanoma cells even at baseline.
These data suggest that Hdm2 preferentially interacts with and degrades a phosphorylated
form of Rb produced by p38- rather than Cdk-mediated phosphorylation. Since we showed
earlier that Ser567 phosphorylation by p38 occurs through a mechanism different from that

of Cdks, we speculated that the ability of p38 to induce an Rb-Hdm2 interaction may be
mediated by phosphorylation specifically on Ser567. We previously generated an Rb mutant
in which serine567 was substituted with an alanine (RbÎ”567), and showed that RbÎ”567
mimics phosphorylation of Ser567 by disrupting the pocket and abrogating binding to E2Fs
(Harbour et al, 1999; Ma et al, 2003). Since RbÎ”567 destabilizes the Rb protein, it has the
same impact as phosphorylation of Ser567 and thus could be used to study how
phosphorylation-induced disruption of Rb tertiary structure might affect its interaction with
Hdm2. The RbÎ”567 mutant interacted strongly with Hdm2 in co-immunoprecipitation
experiments, whereas wildtype Rb or RbÎ”568 which blocks Ser567 phosphorylation
interacted only weakly with Hdm2 (Figure 6D). Inhibition or knock down of Hdm2 blocked
etoposide and Ad-MKK3 induced apoptosis (Figure 6E-H). Taken together, these results
suggest that p38-mediated phosphorylation of Rb on Ser567 leads to Rb degradation and cell
death by modulating its interaction with and degradation by Hdm2.

Discussion
In this study, we provide evidence for a pro-apoptotic signaling pathway induced by
genotoxic stress, in which p38 phosphorylates Rb in a manner that triggers Hdm2-mediated
Rb degradation, and E2F1-dependent cell death (Figure 7). The Rb residue Ser567 is
implicated as a key target of this p38-mediated phosphorylation, providing a molecular
explanation for why Rb phosphorylation by p38 differs mechanistically and physiologically
from that catalyzed by Cdks. This p38-mediated pathway could provide a rapid, cell cycleindependent means for overriding the cell cycle and triggering apoptosis in response to
genotoxic stress.

Author Manuscript

When initial models were being developed to explain how Rb is regulated, Cdks were the
only kinases known to phosphorylate Rb. However more recently other kinases such as p38
have been shown to phosphorylate Rb during stress (Hou et al, 2002; Kishore et al, 2003;
Lee et al, 2003; Nath et al, 2003; Yeste-Velasco et al, 2009; Wang et al, 1999).
Phosphorylation of Rb by Cdks during cell division does not lead to Rb degradation or
apoptosis. This normal cycling depends on Rb remaining in a reversible, partially
inactivated state such that it can still repress pro-apoptotic E2Fs (Wells et al, 2003; Young et
al, 2003). In contrast, p38-mediated phosphorylation leads to degradation of Rb, release of
E2Fs and cell death.

Author Manuscript

The ability of p38, but not Cdks, to phosphorylate Rb on Ser567 efficiently may provide a
key to understanding the different effect that p38 has on Rb compared to Cdks.
Phosphorylation of Rb by Cdks occurs through a hierarchical series of phosphorylation
events each triggering successive conformational changes that enable further
phosphorylation in a stepwise manner (Brown et al, 1999; Harbour et al, 1999; Lundberg &
Weinberg, 1998; Zhang et al, 2000). Previous work has demonstrated that the site that is
least efficiently phosphorylated by Cdks is Ser567. Phosphorylation of this site by Cdks
requires prior phosphorylation of the C-terminus, which contains Cdk docking sites that
bring cyclin-Cdk complexes into proximity of Ser567 through an intramolecular interaction
between the C-terminus and the pocket (Harbour et al, 1999). Ser567 has not been reported
to be phosphorylated during normal cell cycle progression (Lees et al, 1991). We show here

that p38 efficiently phosphorylates Ser567 under conditions favoring apoptosis, and this
phosphorylation does not depend on the intramolecular interactions and conformational
changes associated with Cdk-mediated phosphorylation. This would allow p38 to bypass the
Cdks and directly regulate Rb in a cell cycle-independent manner during apoptotic signaling.
The ability of p38 to phosphorylate Ser567 may be due to its small size, allowing it to access
Ser567, which is located in a recess at the interface of the A and B boxes of the pocket,
where it would likely be inaccessible to the much larger cyclin-Cdk complexes under normal
circumstances (Harbour et al, 1999; Lee et al, 2002). Taken together, these findings suggest
that p38 phosphorylates Rb in a cell cycle-independent manner and that it is the ability of
p38 to phosphorylate Ser567 efficiently that distinguishes the pro-apoptotic effect of p38
phosphorylation from the proliferative effect of Cdk phosphorylation. Consistent with this
hypothesis, Nath and colleagues showed that an Rb mutant with all available
phosphorylation sites mutated to prevent their phosphorylation except Ser567 was unable to
rescue p38-mediated inactivation of Rb (Nath et al, 2003). Similarly, von Willebrand and
colleagues showed that a phosphorylation defective Rb mutant was not resistant to
ubiquitination despite elimination of most of the phosphorylation sites; Ser567 was one of
the few sites that were not mutated (von Willebrand et al, 2003).

Author Manuscript

Several other lines of evidence point to Ser567 as playing an important role in Rb
regulation. The Ser567-Pro568 phospho-acceptor motif is highly conserved across species
(Ma et al, 2003), suggesting that it is the ability of Ser567 to be phosphorylated that is
important in its function. Ser567 is the only phosphorylation site on Rb that is a target of
naturally occurring mutations in human retinoblastoma (Templeton et al, 1991; Yilmaz et al,
1998), suggesting that it plays a different role than the other 15 phosphorylation sites.
Ser567 is the only phosphorylation site on Rb that, when phosphorylated or mutated,
disrupts the A-B box interaction, destabilizes the pocket structure, and abrogates interaction
with E2Fs (Harbour et al, 1999; Ma et al, 2003). Crystallographic studies have shown that
Ser567 mediates critical contacts between the A and B boxes, and that phosphorylation of
this site would be predicted to destabilize the pocket structure and eliminate the E2F binding
site (Lee et al, 2002; Lee et al, 1998).

Author Manuscript

Our finding that genotoxic stress promotes interaction between Rb and Hdm2 parallels
recent findings that a p53 activating compound promotes Mdm2-mediated degradation of
p21, both ultimately leading to cell death (Enge et al, 2009). Here, we provide new insights
into the relationship between Hdm2, an E3 ligase and oncoprotein, and the tumor
suppressors p53 and Rb. It has long been known that Hdm2 interacts with and triggers the
degradation of both p53 and Rb (Momand et al, 1992; Uchida et al, 2005; von Willebrand et
al, 2003; Xiao et al, 1995; Sdek et al, 2005). In particular, Hdm2 binds and ubiquitinates Rb,
targeting it for proteosome-dependent and - independent degradation (Sdek et al, 2004; von
Willebrand et al, 2003; Xiao et al, 1995). Here we show that phosphorylation of Ser567 and
consequent disruption of the Rb pocket may be a critical event that triggers interaction of Rb
with Hdm2. This represents a rare circumstance in which phosphorylation of Rb enhances,
rather than abolishes, its interaction with a binding partner. Further, it is tempting to
speculate that the dual role of Hdm2 in regulating protein levels of two major tumor
suppressors â€“ Rb and p53 â€“ is physiologically relevant, but this has not been confirmed
experimentally. In this model, lower stress levels would favor cycle arrest by disruption of

the Hdm2-p53 interaction and subsequent accumulation of activated p53. But under these
conditions, p38 would not phosphorylate Rb, and Hdm2 would thus not interact with Rb.
The result would be active Rb that could cooperate with p53 to trigger cell cycle arrest. At
higher stress levels, apoptosis would be favored as a mechanism for eliminating a potentially
deleterious cell. Disruption of the Hdm2-p53 interaction would activate p53, and release
Hdm2; however, in this setting, activated p38 would phosphorylate Rb on Ser567, allowing
Hdm2 to interact with Rb triggering its degradation. Furthermore, it has been shown that
Rb-Hdm2 binding stabilizes p53 and promotes p53-dependent apoptosis (Hsieh et al, 1999;
Yap et al, 1999). MK2, a direct transcriptional target of p38, phosphorylates Hdm2 and
enhances its activity (Weber et al, 2005), thus p38 may promote the degradation of Rb
through multiple complementary mechanisms. Loss of Rb and the consequent release of proapoptotic E2Fs, coupled with activation of p53, then tips the balance of cellular events in
favor of apoptosis over cell cycle arrest (Sun et al, 2010; Kitagawa et al, 2008). Without
such a mechanism, activation of p53 might indiscriminately trigger both cell cycle arrest and
apoptotic programs, leading to a chaotic and inefficient response to stress. Consistent with
this model, p53 and Rb compete for binding to Hdm2 (Uchida et al, 2005), p53 requires Rb
for efficient induction of cell cycle arrest (Harrington et al, 1998), and activation of p53
triggers apoptosis in the absence of Rb (Macleod et al, 1996).

Author Manuscript

We describe a genotoxic stress-induced signaling pathway in which p38 phosphorylates Rb
on Ser567, leading to Hdm2-mediated degradation of Rb, release of E2F1, and induction of
apoptosis. This mechanism is not mutually exclusive with other strategies that the cell may
employ for differentially regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, such as through
PI3K/Akt signaling to block the E2F1 apoptotic program during proliferation (Dick &
Dyson, 2003; Hallstrom et al, 2008; Hallstrom et al, 2003) or through binding of
phosphorylated Rb to E2Fs at pro-apoptotic targets and the recruitment of coactivators that
drive expression of these genes (Ianari et al, 2009). It will be important in future studies to
determine how these complementary mechanisms coordinate cell death. Further work will
be necessary to determine whether other E2F family members or other phospho-acceptor
sites on Rb play a role in this cell death response (Dick & Dyson, 2003; Xu et al, 2007).

Insights gleaned from this work could have important therapeutic implications, not only in
cancer, where one may wish to promote cancer cell death or sensitize cancer cells to therapy
by stimulating or mimicking p38 signaling to Rb (Zagorski et al, 2007), but also in
degenerative diseases, where inhibiting this process may have therapeutic benefit. For
example, Rb hyperphosphorylation and degradation mediates neuronal cell death in multiple
neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease and stroke
(Giovanni et al, 2000; Hayashi et al, 2000; Hoglinger et al, 2007; Liu & Greene, 2001;
O'Hare et al, 2000; Park et al, 2000; Ramalho et al, 2004; Thakur et al, 2008). Further, p38
can regulate Rb and modulate cell death in neurons, and pharmacologic blockade of p38 has
a neuroprotection effect (Hou et al, 2002; Yeste-Velasco et al, 2009). Similar mechanisms
may govern the development of atherosclerosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis that occur in
association with myocardial infarction (Hauck et al, 2002; Proctor et al, 2008). These
findings may provide new insights for therapeutic intervention, both to inhibit cell death in
degenerative diseases and to promote cell death in cancer where manipulation of this
mechanism could kill cells directly or sensitize them to radiation or chemotherapy.

p38 phosphorylates Rb directly and by a different mechanism than cyclin E-Cdk2. (A) In
vitro radioactive kinase assays revealed that p38 directly phosphorylated Rb. Top Panel:
Purified p38Î± phosphorylated 0.5 Î¼g of purified full length Rb. Bottom Panel: Endogenous
phospho-p38 immunoprecipitated from Mel202 cells phosphorylated 0.5 Î¼g of purified full
length Rb. (B) Non-radioactive in vitro kinase assays were performed using 20 ng of
purified p38 or cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase. GST-SPÎ”4 (small pocket of Rb, amino acids 379-772
with all phosphoacceptor sites except Ser567 mutated to an alanine) and GST-C (C-terminus
of Rb, amino acids 773-928) were used as substrates. Lanes 1, 4, and 7 had 3.2 Î¼g of GSTC, lanes 2 and 5 had no GST-C, lanes 3 and 6 had 1.6 Î¼g of GST-C. 1 Î¼g of GST- SPÎ”4 was
used. Samples were immunoblotted with an antibody against phospho-Rb-567 which
recognizes the only phosphorylation site on GST-SPÎ”4, Ser567, or an antibody against GST
which recognizes both GST-SPÎ”4 and GST-C. The GST-C and GST-SPÎ”4 Rb fragments
interact (Harbour et al, 1999). GST-C is necessary for efficient phosphorylation of the small
pocket by Cdk2, but is not required for phosphorylation by p38. (C) A graphical

Hypothesis for how p38-mediated phosphorylation of Rb on Ser567 provides a death signal,
rather than the Cdk-mediated proliferative signal, and how shuttling of Hdm2 between p53
and Rb may tightly regulate the cellular response to stress. In quiescent cells, Rb is
hypophosphorylated and active, preventing cell cycle progression. In parallel, Hdm2
maintains p53 at low levels by proteosomal degradation. In normal cycling cells, Rb is
phosphorylated and partially inactivated by Cdks, and Hdm2 continues to maintain p53 at
low levels. When cells are exposed to low levels of genotoxic and perhaps other forms of
stress, p53 is phosphorylated and released from Hdm2, allowing cellular levels of p53 to
increase. A major effect of this increase in p53 is transactivation of p21 which, in turn,
promotes hypophosphorylation and activation of Rb. Rb is available because it has not been
degraded by activation of p38. The net result is stress-induced cell cycle arrest. When cells
are exposed to higher levels of stress, p53 accumulates and, in addition, p38 is activated to
phosphorylate Rb on Ser567, which promotes interaction with Hdm2, degradation of Rb,
and E2F1-mediated apoptosis. With Rb degraded and unavailable to cooperate with p53 to
induce cell cycle arrest, the apoptotic genes under basal inhibition by Rb are derepressed,
leading to an apoptotic response.
