Simultaneous targeting of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Met in cancer therapy is under pre-clinical and clinical
evaluation. Here, we report the ﬁnding that treatment with EGFR inhibitors of various tumor cells, when stimulated with hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) and EGF, results in transient upregulation of phosphorylated AKT. Furthermore, EGFR inhibition in this setting
stimulates a pro-invasive phenotype as assessed in Matrigel-based assays. Simultaneous treatment with AKT and EGFR inhibitors
abrogates this invasive growth, hence functionally linking signaling and phenotype. This observation implies that during treatment
of tumors a balanced ratio of EGFR and Met inhibition is required. To address this, we designed a bispeciﬁc antibody targeting EGFR
and Met, which has the advantage of a ﬁxed 2:1 stoichiometry. This bispeciﬁc antibody inhibits proliferation in tumor cell cultures
and co-cultures with ﬁbroblasts in an additive manner compared with treatment with both single agents. In addition, cell migration
assays reveal a higher potency of the bispeciﬁc antibody in comparison with the antibodies’ combination at low doses. We
demonstrate that the bispeciﬁc antibody inhibits invasive growth, which is speciﬁcally observed with cetuximab. Finally, the
bispeciﬁc antibody potently inhibits tumor growth in a non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model bearing a strong autocrine
HGF-loop. Together, our ﬁndings strongly support a combination treatment of EGFR and Met inhibitors and further evaluation of
resistance mechanisms to EGFR inhibition in the context of active Met signaling.

INTRODUCTION
Escape mechanisms occurring in cancer cells and which develop
in response to inhibition of a speciﬁc signaling pathway often limit
efﬁcacy of targeted single-agent therapies.1 Understanding the
biology of such acquired but also intrinsic resistance mechanisms
in tumors is pivotal for devising future rational combination
therapies. The inhibition of a single receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling presents a good example of molecular networks, which
mediate tumor escape.2 A cross-talk of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and Met in transformed cells was already
described in 2000 by Strom et al.3 EGFR is a member of the
ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases consisting of EGFR (ErbB1),
HER2/neu (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4).4 Constitutive
EGFR signaling has a role in tumor biology by promoting survival
and proliferation of cancer cells. Several EGFR-speciﬁc small
molecular weight inhibitors (for example, geﬁtinib or erlotinib)
as well as antibody modulators (cetuximab or panitumumab)
have been developed and are approved for clinical use.5 Met and
its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are important mediators
of tumor growth, survival and metastasis.6,7 Similarly as for EGFR, a
multitude of inhibitors, small molecules or monoclonal antibodies
directed against Met (for example, tivantinib or onartuzumab
(MetMAb)), are currently tested in clinical trials.8 Increased HGF/
Met signaling can limit the effect of EGFR pathway inhibition and

has been linked with acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs
in EGFR-mutant lung tumors.9,10 Although the incidence of
acquired resistance, as observed in non-small cell lung cancer, is
only about 10%, Met is considered to be a major escape route for
EGFR-targeted therapies.11,12 Not surprisingly, ErbB family
members may also confer resistance to Met tyrosine kinase
inhibition.13,14 Perturbation of both receptors’ activity suggests
that EGFR and Met signaling nodes are highly and dynamically
interconnected.15,16 These ﬁndings are further substantiated in
various cellular models and as such, may reﬂect a general
phenomenon.17–21 As murine HGF is only weakly cross-reactive
to human Met, a combination of erlotinib and SGX523, a small
molecule inhibitor of Met, was assessed in transgenic mice
expressing human HGF and found to be superior to both singleagent treatment.22 In addition, results of a combination study of
erlotinib and onartuzumab strengthen the co-targeting
rationale.23 In this study, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that,
under conditions of active EGFR and Met signaling, treatment with
speciﬁc EGFR inhibitors induces an increase in phosphorylated
AKT and most importantly enhances the invasive properties of
tumor cells. To test the hypothesis that combined inhibition of
both receptor activities is required to suppress invasiveness, we
generated a bispeciﬁc antibody based on the anti-EGFR antibody
cetuximab and the Met-speciﬁc 5D5 antibody. The selected format

for the bispeciﬁc antibody was that of a 2 þ 1 molecule, which
then allows ﬁxed stoichiometry and consequent balanced
inhibition of both receptors.

RESULTS
EGFR inhibition triggers p-AKT and induces invasion in HGFstimulated tumor cell lines
H596 cells, on stimulation with EGF and HGF and treatment with
cetuximab, displayed an increase in phospho-AKT compared with
untreated stimulated cells. This effect was also observed with the
two alternative EGFR inhibitors panitumumab and erlotinib
(Figures 1a and b). This observation, made consistently in the
background of potent stimulation by HGF and EGF, was consistent
and reproducible over a large set of experiments with a mean
increase of 1.62 (Figure 1c). The EGFR inhibitors did not affect
phosphorylation by themselves in the absence of EGF and HGF
stimulation (Supplementary Figures S1A and B). Treatment with
HGF and cetuximab led to a very modest increase of phospho-AKT
in comparison with HGF-treatment only (Supplementary Figure
S1C). Furthermore, spatially restricted increase of AKT phosphorylation was clearly observed in the membrane proximal region of
A549-stimulated cells as described for H596 cells and in the
context of EGFR inhibition (Figure 1d), which might be indicative
for a potential role in migration and invasion events. In order to
explore possible functional consequences, we tested the effect of
EGFR inhibitors in an invasion assay using HGF and EGF-stimulated
cells. Experiments were performed with A431 cells, as this cell line
is a good model to study motility in Matrigel chambers, it
responds to cetuximab treatment with an increase in phosphoAKT when stimulated with HGF and also displays increased
invasion on treatment with HGF and/or EGF (data not shown).

Cetuximab treatment after stimulation with EGF and HGF
increased the invasive phenotype of A431 cells in a statistically
signiﬁcant manner (Po0.001) and this effect was dose-dependently reverted by co-treatment with an AKT inhibitor (AKTi-1/2
VIII; Figures 2a and c). A similar—albeit smaller—increase in
invasion was induced by panitumumab and erlotinib treatments,
and it was similarly impaired by the addition of an AKT inhibitor
(Figures 2b and c). The AKT inhibitor was used at 1 mM: at this
concentration it abrogated Ser473 phosphorylation, which is an
activation marker, and was not cytotoxic in the assay
(Supplementary Figures S2A and B).
MetHer1 impairs proliferation in selected cell lines
To test the hypothesis whether the increase in phospho-AKT and
the accompanying invasive phenotype, potentially mediating
resistance to EGFR inhibition in the presence of HGF, could be
reverted by the simultaneous inhibition of the HGF receptor Met,
we generated a bispeciﬁc antibody construct capable of blocking
EGFR and Met (MetHer1) (Supplementary Figures S3A–C). This was
achieved by cloning the variable regions of cetuximab into an
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody backbone with a monovalent
anti-Met single chain Fab similar to the one-armed 5D5
(onartuzumab) fused at the C-terminus of one of the heavy
chains. Correct heavy chain hetero-dimerization was enforced
using the knobs-into-holes technology.24 The ﬁnal product had a
purity 498% and was able to simultaneously bind to both
antigens (Supplementary Figures S3D and E), displaying binding
kinetics for each antigen in the nM range, comparable to those of
the parental monospeciﬁc antibodies (Supplementary Figures S4A
and B). As a side-product resulting in a bispeciﬁc antibody with
two single chain Fab fusions would be agonistic, the activating
marker phospho-Met was monitored in the presence of MetHer1

and in comparison with the bivalent and agonistic Met
antibody. No agonism could be seen for MetHer1
(Supplementary Figures S3F).
MetHer1 was further characterized in vitro for its effect on
viability in basal conditions in A431, H596 and H322M cell lines
and efﬁcacy was compared with the two parental antibodies given
as monotherapy or in combination (Figure 3a). Cells were
cultivated in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS) and HGF was added for comparison as it is essential for
the functionality of the ligand-dependent 5D5 component of
MetHer1. Treatment only with cetuximab was already efﬁcacious
in A431 cells, which are known to be EGFR addicted, but efﬁcacy
was completely lost on addition of HGF. In this setting, 5D5
antibody alone had no effect as well, whereas only MetHer1 or
the combination of both parental antibodies induced a clear
and signiﬁcant reduction in cell viability (approximately 40%).
This suggests that only inhibiting both receptors simultaneously
may have therapeutic potential in tumor cells where both
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

pathways are active. A very similar result was obtained with
H322M, with MetHer1 showing a 60% growth inhibition. In this
cell line as well, addition of HGF per se did not enhance
proliferation, which 5D5 alone could also not block. However,
addition of HGF impaired the anti-proliferative effect of cetuximab
and only treatment with the combination of cetuximab and 5D5
or with MetHer1 restored growth inhibition. mRNA proﬁling data
suggest a very low expression of Met in this particular cell line,
compared with the other two (data not shown) and our results
imply that the growth inhibition induced by MetHer1 occurred
mainly via the EGFR-speciﬁc arm. Nevertheless, a comparable
effect was not observed, when HGF-stimulated cells were treated
with cetuximab alone.
In H596 cells stimulated with HGF, MetHer1 mediated 60%
growth inhibition, which was signiﬁcantly greater than that
induced by 5D5 alone (Po0.001). Co-culture of H596 with normal
and tumor lung ﬁbroblasts resulted in a higher proliferation rate
after 5 days, which was signiﬁcantly reduced by treatment with

MetHer1 prevents HGF-induced scattering
HGF is also a known motility factor, which induces scattering and
invasion of epithelial cells. This is phenotypically characterized by
a change in cell shape and the effect can be macroscopically
observed in Figure 4a showing DU145 after 24 h of treatment with
HGF. Cellular migration can be semi-quantitatively evaluated
with a real-time cell analyzer (RTCA system), which measures
impedance changes as surrogate parameter of cell adhesion. As
reported in Figure 4a, HGF-induced cell motility and dissemination
of DU145 cells, thus reducing the measured impedance, when
compared with control. Scattering was quantiﬁed in a graph
where a normalized cell index (compound addition) was plotted
against time. DU145 were treated with cetuximab and 5D5, the
combination of both and MetHer1 (at 200 and 10 nM) and
stimulated with EGF and HGF. At high dose, MetHer1 could
completely revert the HGF-induced scattering and to a smaller
extent also at the low dose. In the latter case, no efﬁcacy was seen
instead for the combination of the monospeciﬁc antibodies.
Efﬁcacy of 5D5 alone was reduced by the inﬂuence of EGF
treatment, which per se also showed an effect on cell adhesion
(Figure 4b). Viability analysis displayed no differences between
treatments, excluding any inﬂuence of cell viability or proliferation
on the interpretation of the results (data not shown). A human
IgG control antibody did not inﬂuence cellular scattering
(Supplementary Figures S6C and D), suggesting speciﬁcity of the
reported data. The potential superiority of MetHer1 at low doses
was further evaluated in a dose-response scatter experiment. The
percentage scatter inhibition for MetHer1 or the combination
(Combo) was calculated and the ratio of both determined.
MetHer1 displayed superior inhibitory activity over three logs of
antibody concentration with a sevenfold higher potency at doses
as low as 1 nM (Figure 4c).
To better assess the superiority of MetHer1 versus the
combination in preventing growth factor-induced cell dissociation
at a low dose, the kinetics of internalization of the two
single agents in comparison with MetHer1 was evaluated in a
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting assay. Presence of the receptors
on the cell surface was measured after binding with the respective
antibodies for 2 h, versus t0 (Supplementary Figure S6A). The
amount of antigen–antibody complex on the cell surface was
unchanged within this time. Intracellular staining was only
visible as speckle-like structures after 4 h of incubation with
ﬂuorescently labeled antibodies by confocal microscopy
(Figure 4e, Supplementary Figure S6B). Cetuximab binding
appeared to be stronger compared with 5D5, which may be a
consequence of differential antigen expression (Figure 4d). There
was no difference in the kinetics of internalization between the
molecules. Therefore, superiority of MetHer1 in the scatter assay
could not be explained by differential internalization.

5D5 and MetHer1, but not by cetuximab (Figure 3b). The effect
was probably dependent on ﬁbroblasts producing HGF
(Supplementary Figure S5A).
The anti-proliferative effect of MetHer1 was also evaluated in
combination with a sub-optimal dose of the chemotherapeutic
agent cisplatin in H596 and BxPC3. BxPC3 represents a pancreatic
model in which the bispeciﬁc showed only a weak effect on
viability (Supplementary Figure S5B). Nevertheless, combined
treatment was superior to the effect of cisplatin alone (Po0.001)
with an overall percentage growth inhibition of 460%.
A combination of MetHer1 and cisplatin in H596, which already
responded well to MetHer1 mono-treatment, had no additional
effect. This supports the rationale that a combination of bispeciﬁc
antibody with reduced and thus better tolerated doses
of a chemotherapeutic can improve efﬁcacy and safety, particularly in tumor models, which are less dependent on signaling
(that is, BxPC3).

MetHer1 inhibits EGFR and Met-related pathways
MetHer1 efﬁcacy in proliferation experiments was accompanied
by a strong decrease of target phosphorylation in A431 and H596
(Figure 5a), as well as in other in vitro models (Supplementary
Figure S7A). In A431, phospho-ERK1/2 was blocked by MetHer1
but not or only minimally by treating with the single parental
antibodies. The level of phospho-AKT, which was found to be
increased in HGF/EGF-stimulated cells after treatment with
cetuximab alone reverted back to basal untreated values in the
presence of MetHer1 in ﬁve cancer cell lines of different tissue
origins (Figures 5a and b). In BxPC3, we observed phosphorylation
of Met after stimulation of cells with EGF, which might be due to a
cross-talk between EGFR and Met. MetHer1 also reduced invasion
induced by HGF and EGF and signiﬁcantly counteracted the
effect induced by cetuximab parental antibody in equal settings
(Figures 5c and d). The effect of simultaneous treatment with
cetuximab and 5D5 is additionally shown for comparison.

MetHer1 has a potent antitumor effect in vivo
To test the efﬁcacy of MetHer1 in a mouse model, an A549 tumor
cell line overexpressing HGF was generated by viral transduction
with a vector-encoding human HGF to overcome the issue of noncross-reactivity of murine HGF to human Met and ensure an
efﬁcacy contribution by the 5D5 component. Several clones were
generated and their ability to produce HGF in the presence and
absence of selection pressure was evaluated by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay over a period of 29 days to ascertain stable
expression (Supplementary Figure S8A). Clone20 was selected
because of high secretion levels of HGF and constitutive Met
phosphorylation (Supplementary Figures S8A and C). The RTK
signaling network in this clone was compared with parental A549
by using a phospho-RTK array and affymetrix proﬁling. Overall,
A549 clone20 was comparable in its mRNA expression proﬁle but
displayed a slightly different activation pattern of receptor
tyrosine kinases (Supplementary Figure S8B and data not shown).
HGF-producing A549 clone20 was characterized by cell surface
binding of ﬂuorescently labeled MetHer1, 5D5 and cetuximab.
Although cetuximab and MetHer1 displayed a strong binding
capacity, 5D5 binding was found to be reduced in the HGFoverexpressing clone compared with un-transduced cells
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

(Supplementary Figure S8E). This might be a consequence of
competition with ligand and/or lower steady-state Met cell surface
expression levels because of constitutive internalization induced
by the ligand HGF (Supplementary Figure S8C). MetHer1 inhibited
in vitro phosphorylation of both EGFR and Met to the same extent
as the parental antibodies. When subcutaneously implanted into
mice, tumors produced HGF (7.4±2.71 ng/ml: average of 10
animals), which was further conﬁrmed ex vivo, in tumor lysates
(Supplementary Figure S8D). MetHer1 efﬁcacy was tested in vivo in
the subcutaneous setting and compared with the parental
antibodies, which were administered in an equimolar ratio as
monotherapy or in combination. Tumor growth inhibition at the
end of study was with 75% higher for MetHer1 but not statistically
signiﬁcantly different from the combination (55%) after three
weekly cycles of treatment (tumor growth inhibition for cetuximab
and 5D5: 11% and 51%). Data are presented as tumor growth
inhibition and nonparametric treatment-to-control-ratio graph
(Figures 6a and b). Near infrared ﬂuorescence analysis with
ﬂuorescently labeled antibodies conﬁrmed in vivo binding, as
shown with two representative animals per group (Figure 6c).

probably as a consequence of smaller tumor sizes (Figure 6d). The
low efﬁcacy observed after treatment with cetuximab was
expected because of mutant KRAS status. To predict the effect
of a putative combination of MetHer1 with a MEK inhibitor, which
would block the pathway downstream of KRAS, the effect of
MetHer1 and the MEK inhibitor UO126 on proliferation was tested
in vitro in A549 clone20 cells. Figure 6e shows the results obtained
when UO126 was administered at the sub-optimal dose of 5 mM
alone or in combination with MetHer1 (UO126 IC50 for this cell
line: 12.7 mM; data not shown). In combination with the MEK
inhibitor, a fourfold increase in the percentage inhibition was
observed, supporting that the KRAS mutation strongly inﬂuences
treatment efﬁcacy.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated in detail the counterbalancing
mechanisms mediated by Met that confer resistance to targeted
inhibition of EGFR. We conﬁrmed in tumor cell lines from different
origins that treatment with EGFR inhibitors results in a transient
upregulation of phospho-AKT under conditions of co-activation of
the EGFR and Met pathways. In the presence of active Met
signaling, EGFR inhibition also enhanced invasiveness (Figure 2a).
Invasive growth of tumor cells on stimulation with EGF or HGF is
well known.25 Although a variety of studies on the cross-talk of the
two receptors and their inhibition have been published,19,21,26 it
has not been previously described that addition of EGFR inhibitors
to HGF-stimulated cells can increase invasiveness in comparison
with growth factor treatment only. Bonine-Summers et al.27
previously published that the EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib also inhibits
Met signaling, which is in contrast to our ﬁndings. It has been
Oncogene (2013) 5593 – 5601

shown that geﬁtinib very potently targets cyclin-G-associated
kinase also.28 Meanwhile, it is known that cyclin-G-associated
kinase regulates PP2A and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, both
also important for Met regulation, which might explain the
authors’ ﬁndings.29,30 A very comprehensive study by Gusenbauer
et al.31 demonstrates the intricate cell surface network for
EGFR and Met but also for a variety of membrane proteins,
which are involved in this signaling node. Interference by our
EGFR inhibitors, especially antibodies binding EGFR, might shift
the balance between these signaling nodes and thus produce the
observed effects.
Maseki et al.32 reported that geﬁtinib-resistant head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma can acquire an epithelial to
mesenchymal transition phenotype, which is accompanied by an
increase of phospho-AKT. A similar epithelial to mesenchymal
transition process might occur in our experimental setting,
accompanied by Twist and Snail-mediated repression of
E-cadherin.33 Alternatively, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT
signaling could directly act on focal adhesion kinase.34 Focal
adhesion kinase and Src are known to modulate E-cadherin
and thereby promote cancer cell invasion.35 Further addition of an
AKT inhibitor reversed the invasive phenotype similarly to the
combined inhibition of EGFR and Met (Figures 2a, 5c and d).
This implies, but does not unambiguously prove, that the
transient increase of phospho-AKT is causally linked to the
increase in invasiveness. In this context, it is an intriguing recent
experimental ﬁnding that an artiﬁcial increase of phospho-AKT
results in loss of cetuximab sensitivity in various lung cancer
cell lines.36
Our ﬁndings could be clinically relevant in the setting of an
adjuvant anti-EGFR therapy given that, independently from the

well-known autocrine or paracrine HGF supply by tumor cells and/
or tumor associated ﬁbroblasts, it has been shown that HGF serum
levels are elevated after surgery as part of the wound-healing
process.37–39 However, the duration of this process in patients is
unclear. Targeted EGFR inhibition in lung cancer, in an adjuvant
setting, has already been studied.40 In 2002, the JBR.19 trial
investigated geﬁtinib as maintenance treatment in resected
non-small lung cancer. However, this trial was prematurely
stopped because of negative results of the ISEL and SWOG 0023
trials with geﬁtinib. The ongoing RADIANT trial with erlotinib is
primed to demonstrate whether EGFR inhibition in the adjuvant
setting is beneﬁcial.
Clinical trials with combinations of EGFR and Met inhibitors
are ongoing. In this co-targeting setting, our data suggest that
an imbalance of EGFR and Met-targeting activities in tumor
samples may pose the risk of increased tumor spread. This could
be of special concern if low molecular weight and antibody
inhibitors with different pharmacodynamics are co-administered,
thus making a stronger case for the development of the bispeciﬁc
antibody we described. We have generated a bispeciﬁc antibody
consisting of cetuximab and 5D5 in a 2 þ 1 format under the
assumption that a ﬁxed stoichiometry of both targeting compounds should ensure simultaneous inhibition of both targets
even in poorly accessible solid tumors. Mechanistically, such a
bispeciﬁc antibody might for instance display differential avidity,
clustering and internalization or antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity properties in comparison with the combination of two antibodies. To our knowledge, MetHer1 presents the
ﬁrst bispeciﬁc IgG-like antibody targeting Met and EGFR. The
antibody is non-agonistic and proves the concept of targeting
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

both receptors simultaneously with a bispeciﬁc antibody. Previously, bispeciﬁc antibodies targeting EGFR and IGF-1R have been
described with a similar co-targeting approach41–44 as well as
EGFR was used as targeting moiety for effector cell recruitment or
payload delivery.45,46 MetHer1 displays no agonistic activity in
cellular assays and the overall activity was mostly similar to the
combination of the parental antibodies cetuximab and 5D5.
We observed differences in cell dissemination in the presence of
low inhibitor concentrations. This could possibly be explained by
an avidity effect, which raises the local Met inhibitor concentration
and thereby enhances efﬁcacy. We propose that in the presence
of EGFR binding, the Met component of MetHer1 is enriched
on the cell membrane and can better inhibit Met activity. A close
proximity of both receptors has been previously shown by
co-immunoprecipitation.3
In a ligand-dependent animal model, the overall activity of
MetHer1 was superior but not signiﬁcantly better than the
combination of the parental antibodies cetuximab and 5D5
(Figure 6a). Efﬁcacy of cetuximab is greatly impaired by the KRAS
mutation found in A549. Although the mAb does not confer much
antitumor activity, in the MetHer1construct, cetuximab could
function as targeting moiety leading to more efﬁcient 5D5
recruitment. This could explain the modest superiority of MetHer1
over the combination of parental antibodies but needs further
investigation. The hypothesis is supported by our in vitro cell
dissemination experiments whereby at lower doses MetHer1 was
also more efﬁcacious than the parental antibody combination
(Figures 4b and c).
In contrast to onartuzumab, MetHer1 is a fully glycosylated
human IgG1 antibody. Thus, MetHer1 retains effector function

abilities and these are not affected by the C-terminal fusion of the
5D5 single chain Fab (data not shown). Cetuximab and 5D5, as
used herein, also have a glycosylated human IgG1 Fc-part. In the
A549 clone20 in vivo model, immune effector functions, for
example, by residual macrophages, may have a role. However,
theoretically, these effects should be stronger in the combination
group, as the total Fc load per tumor cell is presumably higher
than for the MetHer1 group.
Although inhibition of tumor growth is a primary parameter,
it remains to be shown if the number of metastases is affected in
models, which display stronger tumor spread, especially after
excision of the primary tumor. A major hurdle is the availability of
human HGF to activate Met in such a model. Transgenic mice
producing human HGF have been described in the past and might
help to address this problem.
In summary, the ﬁndings reported here highlight the complexity of perturbing regulatory networks by the use of targeted
therapies, especially if multiple activating signals are present,
which is the case in the majority of solid tumors, either de novo or
as consequence of acquired resistance. Bispeciﬁc antibodies—as
exempliﬁed by MetHer1—facilitate targeting of two pathways
without the risk of under-dosing one compound, efﬁciently
counteract resistance mechanisms at the molecular level and
yet retain the ability to effectively mediate antibody effector
functions. Potential liabilities of such bispeciﬁc antibodies, for
instance, cumulative toxicities or unanticipated modes of action,
would need to be carefully evaluated during the development
process.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
A431, A549 and BxPC3 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA);
DU145, OVCAR8 and H322M from the NCI (Bethesda, MD, USA); H596 from
Chugai Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and lung normal and
tumor ﬁbroblasts from Asterand plc (Royston, Herts, UK). Except H596, all
cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FCS,
non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate and L-glutamine (Gibco,
Darmstadt, Germany). H596 were maintained in RPMI high glucose,
supplemented with L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES (PAN
Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) and 10% FCS. Cells were propagated
according to standard cell culture protocols.

Proteins and inhibitors
The variable heavy and light chain domain sequences of cetuximab and
5D5.v2, herein referred as 5D5, were cloned based on published sequences
via gene synthesis in mammalian expression vectors. For cetuximab, a
human IgG1 framework and kappa light chain backbone was used. For
5D5, two heavy chain 5D5 plasmids were used which carried the knobsinto-hole mutations47 and in which one was missing the VH-CH1 domain.
MetHer1 was constructed from cetuximab with a human IgG1 backbone
with knobs-into-hole and a single chain Fab fusion of Met at the knob
heavy chain. Light and heavy chains were co-transfected in HEK-293F
(Invitrogen/Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) resulting in full
glycosylation of all antibodies, then puriﬁed as previously described.45
Purity was analyzed using an Agilent HPLC 1100 (Agilent Technologies,
Oberhaching, Germany) with a TSK-GEL G3000SW column (Tosoh Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan). Identity was conﬁrmed by mass spectrometry and binding
properties characterized by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Cetuximab
parental antibody was purchased from Merck Serono (Darmstadt,
Germany), panitumumab from Amgen Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA, USA).
Met and EGFR ectodomains were transiently expressed and puriﬁed from
HEK-293F supernatants. Recombinant huHGF and huEGF were obtained
from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Gibco. AKTi-1/2 VIII and
UO126 were bought from Calbiochem/Merck KgaA (Darmstadt, Germany).
Other antibodies: pEGFR, pAKT1 (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA), EGFR
(Millipore/Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany), pMet, Met, pMAPK, MAPK,
AKT (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) and b-actin
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK).

Immunoblot
Cells (5–8  105 per well) were seeded in a six-well plate in medium with
0.5% FCS and treated the following day with 0.07 mM of cetuximab,
panitumumab, 5D5 and MetHer1 and 5 mM erlotinib for 30 min (1 h for
erlotinib) prior stimulation (HGF 30 ng/ml and EGF 50 ng/ml). After 5 or
15 min of incubation at 37 1C, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline, lysed and subjected to immunoblot analysis. For statistical analysis,
a box plot analysis was applied.

Invasion assay
A431 (50 000 cells per well) were pre-incubated for 15 min at 37 1C with
0.2 mM antibodies, 5 mM erlotinib or AKT inhibitor in medium with 0.5% FCS
and seeded in Matrigel chambers (BD Biocoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers,
BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany), which were beforehand rehydrated
and immersed in 24-well companion plates in medium with 10% FCS and/
or growth factors plus treatment. HGF and EGF were added in the
chambers before incubation for 43 h at 37 1C. Non-invading cells were
removed from the upper surface of the membrane by scrubbing and cells
were ﬁxed and stained (Diff-Quick stain). Pictures were taken at a
magniﬁcation of  100 and invasive cells counted in four different ﬁelds
each of quadruplicate membranes of two independent experiments.
Standard deviation was calculated as average of all values. In parallel,
100 ml of the medium were used for a cytotoxicity assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Proliferation assays
Cells (A431, H322M: 2500 cells per well; H596: 5000 cells per well; A549
clone20: 1000 cells per well) were seeded in medium with 10% FCS and
treated the following day with 0.2 mM of the antibodies for 15 min before
stimulation with HGF 30 ng/ml. Viability was measured via Cell Titer Glo
(Promega) at 5 days (A431, H322M and H596) and 4 days after treatment
for A549 clone20. UO126 was added at 5 mM 24 h before measuring.

Migration assay
Changes in cell morphology were monitored using xCelligence (Roche
Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). DU145 (3000 cells per well) were
seeded in a 96 well-E-plate in medium supplemented with 0.5% serum and
treated the following day with antibodies (200 and 10 nM) for 15 min
before HGF and EGF stimulation (30 and 50 ng/ml).

Xenograft study
To generate primary tumors, 1  107 tumor cells in a volume of 100 ml
phosphate-buffered saline were injected subcutaneously into the right
ﬂank of the mice. Animals were controlled 5  per week for their health
status. Tumor dimensions were measured by caliper on the staging day,
and twice weekly for the treatment period. Animals were treated on study
day 21, 28 and 35. All experiments were approved by the local regulatory
agency. Nonparametric treatment-to-control-ratios based on end point
analysis and the two-sided nonparametric conﬁdence intervals compared
with vehicle group were calculated to assess statistical signiﬁcance.
