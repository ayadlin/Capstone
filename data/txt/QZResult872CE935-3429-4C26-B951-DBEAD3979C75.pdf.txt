BACKGROUND: Treatment of high-risk localized prostate cancer remains inadequate. The authors performed a phase 2 multicenter
trial of neoadjuvant docetaxel plus bevacizumab before radical prostatectomy. METHODS: Eligibility included any of the following:
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >20 ng/mL or PSA velocity >2 ng/mL/y, cT3 disease, any biopsy Gleason score 8 to 10, and Gleason
score 7 with T3 disease by endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T. Also, those with 50% biopsy cores involved and
either Gleason score 7, PSA >10, or cT2 disease were eligible. Patients were treated with docetaxel 70 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6
cycles and bevacizumab 15 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 5 cycles. The primary endpoint was partial response by endorectal MRI.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients were treated. Median age was 55 years (range, 40-66 years). Baseline characteristics included:
median PSA, 10.1 ng/mL; cT2, 49%, cT3, 32%; and Gleason score 8 to 10, 73%. Thirty-eight of 41 (93%) patients completed all 6 cycles.
Grade 3 adverse events were rare, although 3 of 41 (7%) experienced febrile neutropenia. Twelve patients (29%; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 16%-45%) achieved a >50% reduction in tumor volume, and 9 patients (22%; 95% CI, 11%-38%) achieved a >50% posttreatment decline in PSA. Thirty-seven of the 41 patients underwent radical prostatectomy; there were no complete pathologic
responses. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant docetaxel and bevacizumab is safe, and results in reductions in both tumor volume
and serum PSA, in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in prostate cancer, and
perioperative antiangiogenic therapy in general, requires further elucidation through ongoing and planned trials. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States.1 Although radical prostatectomy (RP) is curative in the majority of patients with clinically localized PCa, 30% to 40% of men will develop prostatespecific antigen (PSA) recurrence, many of whom will ultimately die from their disease.2 As has been demonstrated in
other solid tumors, the integration of perioperative systemic treatment may be necessary to increase the likelihood of cure
in this high-risk subset of patients.
The successful development and implementation of perioperative systemic therapeutic strategies for the treatment
of clinically localized solid tumors requires both an accurate means to risk stratify patients and the availability of active
systemic therapy. Furthermore, intermediate endpoints that can be used in the phase 2 setting to help guide decisions
regarding the initiation of large and lengthy definitive phase 3 trials are desirable. In patients with PCa, pretreatment
clinical and pathologic variables, including Gleason score, PSA, and clinical stage, have been shown to accurately predict
PSA recurrence and cancer-related death after RP.3,4 Taxane-based chemotherapy demonstrates activity in a large proportion of patients with advanced disease as measured by post-treatment declines in PSA, symptomatic improvements, and
prolonged survival.5-7 Finally, delivery of systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant setting affords the ability to assess response
in the primary tumor, which has correlated with survival in many other solid tumors.

Several historical randomized trials exploring neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy before prostatectomy in patients with high-risk localized PCa failed to
demonstrate an improvement in clinical outcomes. However, these trials were generally underpowered, suffered
from short durations of treatment and follow-up, and did
not use optimal risk stratification.8-12 The approval of
docetaxel for the treatment of advanced PCa led to a
renewed interest in the evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy
in high-risk localized disease.13-15 We previously reported
a phase 2 study of neoadjuvant docetaxel before RP in 19
men with high-risk localized PCa, demonstrating that
treatment was well tolerated and associated with PSA
declines of 50% in 58% of patients and tumor volume
reductions of 50% by endorectal magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) in 21% of patients.15 On the basis of the
results of our study and others, a phase 3 study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy
followed by prostatectomy versus prostatectomy alone in
patients with high-risk localized PCa was initiated by the
Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 90203) and is
ongoing.16
Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody
that binds to and neutralizes serum vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), a major mediator of tumor angiogenesis. The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy
has led to improved clinical outcomes in patients with
diverse solid tumors.17,18 Phase 2 studies of docetaxel plus
bevacizumab in castration-resistant PCa19-21 have demonstrated significant activity leading to a phase 3 CALGB
trial in patients with metastatic disease.22 Recently, this
study was reported not to demonstrate a survival advantage with the combination, but did show biological activity
with a longer progression-free survival in the group receiving bevacizumab. Given that tumors generally cannot
grow beyond 1 to 2 mm3 without recruitment of the neovasculature, the benefits of inhibiting VEGF may be more
substantial in the setting of micrometastatic disease.23
Therefore, we initiated a phase 2 multicenter trial to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of
docetaxel and bevacizumab in men with high-risk localized PCa before RP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population

This study was designed as a single-arm, 3-site (Dana
Farber Cancer Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center) phase 2
trial as part of the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium.24 Eligible patients had histologic documentation of
4778

adenocarcinoma of the prostate and were candidates for
RP. Patients were considered high risk for recurrence as
defined by 1 or more of the following characteristics:
Gleason score 8, Gleason score 7 and endorectal MRI
T3 disease, clinical T stage of T3a or T3b, serum PSA
20 ng/mL, and PSA velocity of 2 ng/mL/y in the year
before diagnosis. In addition, patients with 50% of the
total number of biopsy cores positive for PCa were eligible
provided that 1 of the following characteristics was also
present: Gleason score of 7; clinical T stage of T2a, T2b,
or T2c; and/or serum PSA 10 ng/mL. All patients were
required to be free from evidence of metastatic disease,
have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1, and have a serum testosterone of
>100 ng/dL. Patients with a history of unstable angina,
symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, New York Heart
Association class III heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction or stroke during the 12
months before enrollment, history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, known coagulopathy or
bleeding diathesis, ongoing use of anticoagulant therapy,
abdominal fistulas, gastrointestinal perforation, nonhealing ulcer or fracture, or spot urine protein:creatinine ratio
>1.0 were excluded. Other eligibility criteria included
adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. The
protocol was approved by the institutional review boards
at each participating institution. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients before enrollment.
Pretreatment Evaluation

The pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical
history and physical examination including a digital rectal
examination (DRE). Baseline studies included a spot
urine protein:creatinine ratio, complete blood count with
differential, serum chemistries including creatinine and
liver function tests, PSA, testosterone, and an electrocardiogram. All patients underwent a baseline endorectal
MRI at 1.5 T.
Treatment Plan

The treatment plan was as follows. All patients underwent
a baseline endorectal MRI and a restaging endorectal
MRI after 6 cycles of systemic therapy. Docetaxel was
administered on day 1 at a dose of 70 mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days with standard dexamethasone
premedications and antiemetics. Bevacizumab was
administered on day 1 at a dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously
every 21 days. Combination treatment with docetaxel
plus bevacizumab was administered during cycles 1 to 5,
and docetaxel alone was administered during cycle 6.
Patients underwent a repeat DRE on cycle 2, day 1 and on
Cancer

cycle 4, day 1. Patients with disease progression by DRE
underwent an early restaging endorectal MRI. Toxicity
assessments were performed on the day of each treatment
using the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National
Cancer Institute version 3.0. The dose of docetaxel and/or
bevacizumab was held and/or decreased as per an algorithm based on the specific toxicity.
Patients continued to receive therapy until completion of 6 cycles. Treatment was discontinued early in the
event of progressive disease defined as at least 1 of the
following: appearance of metastatic disease; serum PSA
150% of cycle 1 day 1 value, confirmed with another
serum PSA taken at least 2 weeks later; and increase in
tumor volume by at least 50% from baseline, as measured
by endorectal MRI.
All patients were reevaluated by participating urologists for consideration of RP once chemotherapy was
completed. The surgical approach, including decisions
regarding lymphadenectomy and nerve-sparing techniques, was left to the discretion of the surgeon. The surgery
was to take place between 5 and 8 weeks after completion
of neoadjuvant therapy, allowing for full recovery from
the last cycle of chemotherapy.
Response Assessments

Antitumor response was assessed with an endorectal MRI
repeated after completion of 6 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy. A response was defined as a decrease in tumor size of
>50% for the largest lesion in the prostate by endorectal
MRI using methodology as previously described.15
Briefly, on the baseline endorectal MRI, 1 target PCa
lesion was identified. This lesion was identified on multiplanar T2-weighted imaging. The target lesion was identified as the largest of the lesions in the prostate and was
ideally >0.5 mm3. The target lesion was measured and
recorded by its longest diameter in 3 dimensions to derive
a volumetric measurement. This measurement required a
>50% reduction in size for the patient to be considered a
responder. Serum PSA levels were checked at baseline,
with each cycle of therapy, 4 to 6 weeks after RP, then at
least every 6 months during the 5-year follow-up period.
All RP specimens were submitted to a reference pathologist (M.B.) for central review.
Statistical Methods

This trial was designed as a Simon 2-stage single-arm
phase 2 trial to differentiate an endorectal MRI response
rate of 35% from a response rate of 18% (based on our
prior study with docetaxel alone15) with a target alpha of
.06 and a beta of .20. If 4 or more of the initial
17 patients responded, enrollment continued to a total of
Cancer

42 patients. If 12 or more responses were observed, then
the regimen was considered worthy of further study.
All patients who received at least 1 dose of protocol
therapy were included in the assessment of response,
regardless of their disease evaluations. Endorectal MRI
and PSA response (the rate of any PSA decline and PSA
decline by 50%) were reported with exact binomial 95%
confidence interval (CI). Endorectal MRI and PSA
response were also graphically described using waterfall
diagrams.
The proportion of patients who achieved a nadir of
<0.1 ng/mL post-RP was reported with 95% CI. Biochemical recurrence was defined as the first PSA 0.2 ng/mL
(confirmed by subsequent PSA 0.2) or date of initiation
of new therapy post-RP. Patients without biochemical
recurrence were censored at last follow-up for PSA. Distribution and median time to biochemical recurrence were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology.
Analyses were performed using SAS statistics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
An early stopping rule for toxicity was also used.
After 17 patients underwent RP, their postoperative
course was reviewed by a team of physicians including at
least 1 urologist and 1 medical oncologist for toxicities
that occurred that were both serious and unexpected. If 3
or more such unexpected grade 3 or 4 adverse events
occurred, plans were to close the study. With this rule, the
probability of detecting a true unexpected serious toxicity
rate of 30% was 92.3%.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Between July 2006 and November 2008, 42 patients were
enrolled on study; however, 1 patient withdrew from the
study before receiving any treatment. Therefore, a total of
41 patients were included in the analysis. The disposition
of these 41 patients is outlined in Figure 1. The baseline
patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. The median age of enrolled patients was 55 years (range, 41-67
years). The majority of patients had cT2 (49%) or
cT3 (32%) disease and a Gleason score of 8 to 10 (73%).
The median baseline PSA was 10.1 ng/mL (range,
2.1-72.4 ng/mL).
Treatment Delivery

Three of the 41 patients discontinued neoadjuvant therapy before completion of all 6 cycles (docetaxel-related
allergic reaction Â¼ 1, patella fracture Â¼ 1, rising PSA Â¼
1). The treatment delivery is outlined in Table 2. The

months). Thirty-seven of the 41 patients underwent RP.
The reasons for not proceeding with surgery in the
remaining 4 patients included a Foley catheter-related
puncture of the bladder neck and rectum before surgery,
surgeonâ€™s decision based on results of lymphadenectomy,
and withdrawal of consent in 2 patients. The median time
from completion of chemotherapy to RP was 1.2 months
(maximum, 1.8 months).
Adverse Events During Neoadjuvant Therapy

The treatment-related adverse events experienced by
>10% of patient are outlined in Table 3. The vast majority of adverse events were low grade and consistent with
previously described side effects of docetaxel and bevacizumab. Notably, there were no episodes of grade 3 or 4
hypertension, bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation, or
thromboembolic events. There were 3 episodes of grade 3
febrile neutropenia.
Radical Prostatectomy

The median procedural time for the 37 patients undergoing RP was 240 minutes (range, 119-308 minutes), and
median blood loss was 500 mL (range, 75-1700 mL).
Two patients experienced grade 2 to 4 adverse events that

Antitumor Outcomes

Endorectal MRI responses were evaluable in 38 patients.
Reasons for the lack of endorectal MRI response data in
the remaining 3 patients included discontinuation of
treatment after cycle 3 (n Â¼ 1) and lack of measurable target lesions (n Â¼ 2). A waterfall plot detailing the posttreatment changes in tumor volume by endorectal MRI is

(Fig. 2).
Of the 37 patients who underwent RP, 24 (65%;
95% CI, 47%-80%) achieved a nadir <0.1 ng/mL postsurgery (Fig. 1). Nineteen of the 37 (51%) patients have
not developed biochemical recurrence postprostatectomy
(as defined by a PSA 0.2 ng/mL confirmed by subsequent PSA 0.2). The median time to recurrence from
the date of prostatectomy was 13.0 months among the 37
patients who underwent RP (range, 1.2-41.5Ã¾ months).
Among the 24 patients who had achieved a PSA nadir of
<0.1 post-RP, the median time to biochemical recurrence
from date of surgery had not yet been reached. The 2-year
biochemical recurrence-free rate among the 24 patients
was 68% (95% CI, 45%-83%).
The results of the central pathologic review are
presented in Table 4. No patients achieved a pathologic
complete response.
Post-treatment Testosterone Levels

The median testosterone level after completing chemotherapy was 382 ng/mL (range, 164-909 ng/mL).
No patients experienced a decline in testosterone level to
<50 ng/mL during treatment.
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrates the safety and antitumor
activity of neoadjuvant docetaxel plus bevacizumab in
patients with high-risk localized PCa. Specifically, this
study shows that this combination can be administered
with rare grade >2 toxicities and uncommon intraoperative or perioperative complications. Furthermore, the majority of patients achieved some reduction in tumor
volume by endorectal MRI and decreases in PSA.
Unfortunately, similar to other reported neoadjuvant
studies, no complete pathologic responses were observed.
The rate of PSA progression in this high-risk cohort after
treatment was higher than reported in some other neoadjuvant series,25 but similar to our prior study of neoadjuvant docetaxel alone.15 Although a worsening of
outcomes with the addition of bevacizumab could be

postulated, this is not highly suspected based on the available nonrandomized data.
The role of neoadjuvant docetaxel in high-risk localized PCa is the subject of ongoing randomized studies.16,26 We previously demonstrated that single-agent
docetaxel was associated with a reduction of tumor volume of >50% in 21% of patients,15 compared with 29%
of patients in the current study of docetaxel plus bevacizumab. However, the small sample sizes of these studies and
problems inherent in cross-study comparisons make conclusions regarding incremental improvements problematic. Furthermore, although tumor down-staging by MRI
represents a noninvasive intermediate endpoint obtainable in the vast majority of patients on the current study,
whether endorectal MRI response correlates with progression-free survival or overall survival has not yet been established and is the subject of ongoing work. Endorectal
MRI may suffer from intraobserver variability, and other
methodologies to aid in the interpretation of the results of

single-arm neoadjuvant trials, such as comparing observed
outcomes to nomogram-predicted outcomes, could also
be considered. Also of note, in the current study, endorectal MRI responses did not directly correlate with posttreatment declines in PSA. Post-treatment decline in PSA
may not be a useful endpoint in the neoadjuvant setting, a

finding that warrants further evaluation, and correlation
with long-term clinical outcomes, in an effort to define
an optimal intermediate endpoint for neoadjuvant PCa
studies. Although complete pathologic responses to neoadjuvant therapy have been associated with improved
long-term outcomes in other solid tumors, complete pathologic responses have been an extremely rare event in neoadjuvant PCa studies, raising some concerns regarding the
ultimate outcomes of ongoing randomized phase 3 trials
evaluating neoadjuvant docetaxel in PCa. At the same
time, the response rate to docetaxel in metastatic PCa is at
least as high as the response rate to other single agents in
solid tumors where chemotherapy has demonstrated benefit in the perioperative setting (eg, 5-fluorouracil in colon
cancer), and relying only on changes in the primary tumor
may not fully capture the potential benefits of systemic
therapy on micrometastatic disease. Ultimately, the results
of randomized trials will be required to determine
whether the responses achieved with docetaxel-based neoadjuvant therapy in PCa are sufficient to improve clinical
outcomes.
The results of the current study must be interpreted
in the context of additional clinical data regarding the use
of bevacizumab that have emerged since the conduct of
this trial. CALGB 90401, in patients with castrationresistant PCa, demonstrated that although the combination regimen was associated with a statistically significant

improvement in response rate and progression-free survival, there was no significant improvement in overall survival with the addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel.22
Despite these findings, the potential mechanism of action
of antiangiogenic therapy in patients with bulky metastatic disease (eg, vascular normalization and improved
chemotherapy delivery) may be quite different from the
mechanism in patients at high risk for micrometastatic
disease (eg, preventing metastases through inhibition of
recruitment of the neovasculature). In this regard, the
results of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project C-08 and the AVANT study are more concerning.
Both of these randomized phase 3 trials, exploring the use
of adjuvant chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in high-risk
localized colon cancer, failed to demonstrate an improvement in relapse-free survival with the addition of adjuvant
antiangiogenic therapy.27 The results of ongoing randomized studies exploring perioperative bevacizumab in other
solid tumors will be helpful in determining whether
docetaxel plus bevacizumab warrants further evaluation as
neoadjuvant therapy in PCa.
The role of integration of androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT) into neoadjuvant regimens is also worthy
of discussion. Several randomized trials have explored various durations of neoadjuvant ADT before prostatectomy.8-12 These trials have generally revealed improved
tumor down-staging and a lower rate of positive surgical
margins with the use of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy,
but no significant impact on long-term clinical outcomes.
PCa xenograft studies have demonstrated conflicting findings regarding the optimal treatment sequence on combination chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy.28,29 Phase 2
studies have demonstrated the feasibility and activity of
docetaxel plus ADT as neoadjuvant therapy before prostatectomy, with 1 study demonstrating 2 complete pathologic responses.13 Recently, preliminary results from the
GETUG 12 trial, which randomized patients with highrisk localized PCa to neoadjuvant ADT alone versus ADT
plus docetaxel and estramustine, followed by local therapy
(radiation in the majority), were reported.26 The chemohormonal regimen was associated with a significant
improvement in PSA response rate and a nonsignificant
improvement in 4-year progression-free survival,
although the event rate was lower than expected on both
arms. The combined chemohormonal approach, followed
by prostatectomy, is being further explored in CALGB
90203.16
In summary, the current study demonstrates the
safety and activity of docetaxel plus bevacizumab as neoadjuvant therapy before prostatectomy in patients with

high-risk localized PCa. Given that subsets of patients will
likely benefit preferentially from both docetaxel and bevacizumab, molecular correlates of response to treatment on
the current trial are being analyzed and will be reported
separately. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
PCa, and perioperative antiangiogenic therapy in solid
tumors, requires further elucidation through the results of
ongoing randomized clinical trials.
