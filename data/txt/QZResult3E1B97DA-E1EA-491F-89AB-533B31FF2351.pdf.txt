Abstract
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with proven efficacy in
multiple myeloma and non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma. This study
reports the effects of bortezomib in B-cell lymphoma cell lines
with differing sensitivity to bortezomib to investigate factors
that influence sensitivity. Bortezomib induced a time- and
concentration-dependent reduction in cell viability in five
lymphoma cell lines, with EC50 values ranging from 6 nmol/L
(DHL-7 cells) to 25 nmol/L (DHL-4 cells) after 72 h. Bortezomib
cytotoxicity was independent of p53 function, as all cell lines
exhibited mutations by sequence analysis. The difference in
sensitivity was not explained by proteasome or nuclear factorKB (NF-KB) inhibition as these were similar in the most and
least sensitive cells. NF-KB inhibition was less marked than
that of a specific NF-KB inhibitor, Bay 11-7082. Cell cycle
analysis showed a marked G2-arrested population in the least
sensitive DHL-4 line only, an effect that was not present with
Bay 11-7082 treatment. Conversely, in DHL-7 cells, bortezomib
treatment resulted in cells moving into an aberrant mitosis,
indicative of mitotic catastrophe that may contribute to
increased sensitivity to bortezomib. These studies show that
although bortezomib treatment had similar effects on apoptotic and NF-KB signaling pathways in these cell lines, different
cell cycle effects were observed and induction of a further
mechanism of cell death, mitotic catastrophe, was observed in
the more sensitive cell line, which may provide some pointers
to the difference in sensitivity between cell lines. An improved
understanding of how DHL-7 cells abrogate the G2-M cell cycle
checkpoint may help identify targets to increase the efficacy of
bortezomib. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2783–90]

Introduction
The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is essential for the regulated
degradation of intracellular proteins in eukaryotic cells (1, 2).
The proteasome degrades damaged, oxidized, or misfolded proteins
but also plays a vital role in degrading proteins that regulate the cell
cycle, activate transcription factors, and control cell growth. The
proteasome is an ATP-dependent multicatalytic enzyme expressed
in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The complete 26S proteasome
complex comprises the 19S regulatory subunits that recognize and
remove the polyubiquitinated chain from proteins and a 20S
proteolytic core (3). This core particle contains catalytic sites with

chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and post-glutamyl peptide hydrolase-like activity (4). The proteasome plays a key role in cellular
metabolism and has important functions in the control of
malignancy by its direct or indirect action on transcription factors,
such as nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), cell cycle proteins, signaling
molecules, and tumor suppressor genes. Many of these proteins are
involved in maintaining the malignant phenotype (5).
Bortezomib (Velcade) is a specific inhibitor of the chymotryptic
activity of the proteasome that has cytotoxic activity in several
malignant cell lines. It has shown proven efficacy in phase II/III
trials in patients with multiple myeloma and malignant lymphoma
(6–8). The key component of its mechanism of action was initially
thought to be inhibition of NF-nB, which acts as a transcription
factor for antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, c-IAP2, and survivin,
but is also known to stabilize p53 and cell cycle proteins, such as
p21 and p27 (9–11). We have recently reported large differences in
sensitivity to bortezomib in primary lymphoma samples, which
correlated with sensitivity to the drug in patients treated in a phase
II clinical trial (12). The aim of this study was to investigate the
effects of bortezomib in B-cell lymphoma cell lines with differing
sensitivity to bortezomib to investigate possible mechanisms of
cell death and factors that may influence sensitivity to the drug.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines
A panel of five B-cell lymphoma cell lines, all derived from patients with
transformed follicular lymphoma, was used. DHL-4 and DHL-7 cell lines
were kind gifts from Dr. Margaret Shipp (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Boston, MA). DoHH2, CRL, and SUD4 cell lines were kind gifts from Prof.
Finbarr Cotter (The Centre for Haematology, Bart’s and the London School
of Medicine, London, United Kingdom). All cells were grown in suspension
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin
(10,000 units/mL) and streptomycin (10,000 Ag/mL) at 37jC in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2.

Drugs
Bortezomib [Velcade; [(1R)-3-methyl-1-[(2S)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-2-[(pyrazinyl
carbonyl) amino]propyl] amino]butyl] boronic acid] was kindly provided by
Millennium Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA), and Bay 11-7082 [(E)3-[(4methylphenyl)sulfonyl]-2-propenenitrile] was obtained from Merck Biosciences Ltd. (Nottingham, United Kingdom).

Cell Number and Viability
Cell number and viability were determined by trypan blue exclusion
staining. The concentration required to reduce viability by 50% (EC50) at
day 3 was calculated using a sigmoidal E max model in GraphPad Prism.

20S Proteasome Activity
Proteasome activity in cytosolic extracts (without protease inhibitors)
was examined by measuring the release of the fluorophore 7-amino4-methylcoumarin (AMC) after cleavage from the labeled substrate

Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-AMC, which is hydrolyzed by chymotryptic activity of the
20S proteasome. The free AMC fluorescence was quantified using a 355/444nm filter set in a 96-well plate reader. Results were expressed as the
percentage of control proteasome activity.

p53 Mutation Analysis
Mutation screening. DNA from the cell lines was prepared and
examined for mutations by single-strand conformational polymorphism
(SSCP) and sequence analysis. PCR amplification of the entire coding region
of TP53 was carried out using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom). For DNA sequencing, primers
were unlabeled; for SSCP, both primers were 5¶ labeled with Fam or Hex
fluorochromes. For SSCP analysis, fluorescent PCR products were diluted
1:40 with water and 1 AL of the diluted product was mixed with 0.5 AL
of ROX-500 size standards and 10.5 AL of HiDi formamide (Applied
Biosystems). The samples were denatured at 95jC for 2 min and snap
cooled on ice. SSCP analysis was carried out on a 3100 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems) at 18jC and 30jC using 5% GeneScan polymer
containing 10% glycerol and 1 Tris-TAPS-EDTA buffer (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using GeneScan 3.7.1 and Genotyper 2.5
software (Applied Biosystems). Mutation detection was by visual inspection
of electropherogram traces. Sequencing reactions were carried out using
ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit version 2 (Applied
Biosystems). Data analysis was carried out using Sequence Analysis 3.0
(Applied Biosystems) and SeqMan (DNAStar, Madison, WI) software and by
visual inspection of electropherograms.

Western Blot Analysis
Protein extracts were prepared by lysing cells in Triton X-100 lysis buffer
[1 PBS, Triton X-100 (1% v/v), sodium deoxycholate (0.5% w/v), SDS (0.1%
w/v), EDTA (1 mmol/L)] with the addition of protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L sodium
fluoride, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 Ag/mL aprotinin, 5 Ag/mL
leupeptin, and 5 Ag/mL pepstatin A). Samples were stored at 70jC until
Western blot analysis. The protein content of each lysate was determined by
use of the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Poole, United Kingdom).
Cellular lysate (20–50 Ag) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were then
electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The following primary

antibodies were used: rabbit anti-human Bax, mouse anti-human caspase8, and rabbit anti-human caspase-9 (Oncogene Research Products, Boston,
MA), mouse anti-human Bcl-xl, mouse anti-human poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), and mouse anti-human h-actin (DAKO Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom), mouse anti-human cyclin B1 and rabbit antihuman Wee-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). A horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 was used as secondary
antibody for mouse primary antibodies, and anti-rabbit IgG antibody was
used for the rabbit (DAKO). The protein bands were visualized using an
enhanced chemiluminescence visualization system (ECL Plus, Amersham
Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom).

NF-KB–Binding Activity

DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells were cultured at the EC50 and 2  EC50
concentrations (cell viability) of bortezomib and Bay 11-7082 for 4, 8, and
24 h, and cell lysates were prepared (Bay 11-7082 EC50: 6 Amol/L for DHL-4
cells and 3.5 Amol/L for DHL-7 cells). The p65 DNA-binding activity of
NF-nB was quantified by ELISA by means of the Trans-AM NF-nB p65
Transcription Factor Assay kit (Active Motif North America, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. NF-nB binding to the target
oligonucleotide was detected by incubation with primary antibody specific
for the activated form of p65, visualized by anti-IgG-HRP conjugate and
developing solution, and quantified at 450 nm with a reference wavelength
of 620 nm. Specificity was established by incubation with a wild-type
consensus oligonucleotide (5¶-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3¶), which
competes with the substrate for binding. This was subtracted from the value
obtained for the consensus DNA sequence in the absence of competitor.
All samples were analyzed in duplicate.

Cell Cycle Distribution
Distinct phases of the cell cycle were distinguished by DNA staining
with the fluorescent dye propidium iodide and measured by flow
cytometry. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, and
stained with 500 AL propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL and 50 Ag/mL RNaseA in
PBS). Cells were washed again in PBS. Five thousand cells were analyzed
for each data point, and percentage of cells in sub-G1 (apoptotic), G1, S,
and G2-M phases were determined using the cell cycle analysis program
WinMDI.

Bortezomib in B-Cell Lymphoma Cell Lines

Figure 2. A and B, bortezomib activates intrinsic and extrinsic pathways for apoptosis. DHL-4 and DHL-7 cell lines were treated with the EC50 concentration of
bortezomib for 18 to 72 h, and protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. PARP, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were activated by
bortezomib by the appearance of cleavage fragments (CF) from 18 h in DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells. h-Actin was used as a loading control. Bortezomib has varied effects
on Bcl-2 family proteins in sensitive and resistant cell lines. Increasing duration of exposure to bortezomib resulted in an increase in Bcl-2 in DHL-4 and DHL-7
cell lines. Bax was not expressed in DHL-4 cells but increased in DHL-7 cells with bortezomib treatment. Bak protein expression increased in DHL-4 cells but was
unaffected in DHL-7 cells after exposure to bortezomib. h-Actin was used as a loading control. C, these changes did not result in a change in MMP in either cell line
at 6 nmol/L measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis at 24 h. At 25 nmol/L bortezomib, the percentage of cells with reduced MMP was increased in
the more sensitive DHL-7 cells. Columns, mean of three separate experiments; bars, SD.

Mitochondrial Membrane Potential

Cells (5  105/mL) were plated in 24-well plates and treated with
bortezomib for 24 h. After centrifugation (400  g for 5 min) and washing,
cells were resuspended in 500 AL of 1 JC-1 reagent (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA) in assay buffer and incubated for 20 min at 37jC and 5% CO2 in a
humidified incubator. Cells were then washed twice in cell culture medium,
resuspended in 500 AL assay buffer, and immediately analyzed by flow
cytometry (FACSCalibur System, BD Biosciences, Oxford, United Kingdom).
JC-1 staining was detected simultaneously at 515 to 545 nmol/L (FL-1, JC-1
aggregates, red staining, healthy cells) and 546 to 606 nmol/L (FL-2, JC-1
monomers, green staining, apoptotic cells). Results are presented as cells
with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; in %).

Results
Bortezomib induces a time- and concentration-dependent
reduction in cell viability that is independent of p53 function.
The effect of bortezomib treatment was assessed in a panel of five
cell lines, which showed a variation in sensitivity to bortezomib
(Fig. 1A). The EC50 (concentration required to reduce viability by

Immunofluorescent Staining
The monoclonal antibody MPM2 (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany) was used
to determine whether cells had entered mitosis by recognizing mitosisspecific phosphoepitopes. DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells were treated with EC50
concentrations (cell viability) of bortezomib for 28 h, as this was the time
point where the greatest difference in mitotic entry proteins was observed in
preliminary experiments. Cells (25,000) were cytocentrifugated onto a
microscope slide using a Shandon Southern Cytospin (Shandon, Pittsburgh,
PA), air dried, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were then
permeabilized and incubated in a blocking solution (3% normal goat serum
in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 30 min before overnight incubation at 4jC with
anti-phospho-Ser/Thr-MPM2 (Upstate, Dundee, Scotland) antibody at a
dilution of 1:2,000. After washing, slides were incubated for 2 h in the dark
with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (DAKO)
at a 1:100 dilution, then incubated with 50 ng/mL 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 2 min, washed, and mounted in fluorescent
mounting medium (DAKO). Slides were then viewed under a Zeiss Axioskop
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, United Kingdom)
attached to a CCD camera (Photometric Ltd., Tucson, AZ) driven by IPL Labs
Spectrum and SmartCapture (Digital Scientific, Cambridge, United Kingdom) software. The filter wheel was set at Texas red (excitation,
540–580 nm/emission, 600–660 nm) and DAPI (excitation, 310–380 nm/
emission, 435–485 nm).

inhibition than bortezomib in DHL-4 (A and B) and DHL-7 (C and D) cell lines.
Cells were treated with equipotent concentrations (EC50 and 2  EC50) of
bortezomib and Bay 11-7082 for 4, 8, and 24 h, and p65 DNA-binding activity
of NF-nB was quantified by ELISA (Bay 11-7082 EC50: 6 Amol/L in DHL-4 cells
and 3.5 Amol/L in DHL-7 cells). Columns, mean of three separate experiments;

50%) after exposure to bortezomib for 72 h is shown in Fig. 1B.
Shorter durations of exposure (4–12 h) followed by incubation
in drug-free medium out to 72 h resulted in similar differences
in sensitivity between sensitive (DHL-7) and more resistant
(DHL-4) cell lines (data not shown). All cell lines had nonfunctional p53 mutations (Fig. 1B) apart from DoHH2, which had a
heterozygous mutation with evidence of function, although
reduced, when examined using a functional p53 assay (FASAY; data
not shown; ref. 13).
Bortezomib inhibits proteasome activity that is sustained
for 24 h in sensitive and more resistant cell lines. In view of
differences in sensitivity between DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells, the effect
of bortezomib on proteasome activity was examined to elucidate
whether less marked inhibition of the proteasome may explain
reduced sensitivity in the DHL-4 cell line. There was no difference
in total proteasome activity in untreated cells (data not shown).
Bortezomib treatment resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of proteasome activity in both cell lines, observed by 4 h and
sustained until 24 h (Fig. 1C and D). There was no significant
difference between DHL-4 and DHL-7 proteasome inhibition at
6 nmol/L (59.5 F 10.5% versus 64.3 F 9.6%; P = 0.43). At 24 h, there
was a trend toward greater proteasome inhibition in DHL-7 cells
than DHL-4 cells, a difference that reached statistical significance
at 12 nmol/L (P = 0.03; Fig. 1D).

Bortezomib treatment causes cell death via activation of
caspases and apoptosis and affects Bcl-2 family of proteins.
The most sensitive cell line (DHL-7) and the most resistant cell line
(DHL-4) were used to examine possible mechanisms of cell death
and factors that may determine sensitivity. Treatment with the
EC50 concentration (% viability) of bortezomib resulted in
activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 with PARP cleavage observed
in both the DHL-4 and DHL-7 cell lines (Fig. 2A). Bortezomib
treatment resulted in an increase in the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2
in both cell lines and differing effects on proapoptotic proteins.
Bortezomib resulted in an increase in Bax in DHL-7 cells. This
protein was not expressed in DHL-4 cells, but here, Bak was
increased after exposure to bortezomib (Fig. 2B). These changes
only resulted in a decrease in MMP in the more sensitive DHL-7
cells at the higher concentration (25 nmol/L) at 24 h (Fig. 2C). After
72 h of exposure to 25 nmol/L bortezomib, changes were similar in
DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells (data not shown).
NF-KB–binding activity after treatment with bortezomib or
the specific NF-KB inhibitor Bay 11-7082. Treatment of DHL-4
and DHL-7 cells with EC50 concentrations (% viability) of
bortezomib resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of
p65 NF-nB–binding activity at 4, 8, and 24 h. An equipotent
concentration (% viability) of Bay 11-7082, however, resulted in
greater inhibition of activity than bortezomib at all times, which

different cell cycle effects in DHL-4 and
DHL-7 cell lines, whereas Bay 11-7082
treatment has equivalent effects in the two
cell lines. A and B, cells were exposed to
the EC50 concentrations of bortezomib and
Bay 11-7082 for 24 to 72 h, and cell cycle
distribution was analyzed by flow
cytometry. Bortezomib treatment results
in a time-dependent G2-M cell cycle arrest
in DHL-4 from 24 to 72 h. A, bortezomib
treatment results in apoptosis without a
G2-M arrest in DHL-7 cells. B, increasing
duration of exposure to Bay 11-7082 had
equivalent effects on cell cycle distribution
in DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells with no G2-M
arrest observed in the DHL-4 cells.
C, increasing concentrations of bortezomib
after 72 h of exposure result in a G2-M
cell cycle arrest in the DHL-4 cell line only.
D, increasing concentrations of Bay
11-7082 have comparable effects on cell

lines at 72 h. Columns, mean of three

was more apparent at the higher concentration in both DHL-4
(Fig. 3A and B) and DHL-7 (Fig. 3C and D) cells. In the bortezomibtreated cells, NF-nB activity returned toward control levels by 24 h.
Effects of bortezomib on cell cycle distribution. Flow
cytometric analysis revealed significant changes in the distribution
profile of DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells treated with bortezomib, which
occurred in a concentration- and duration-dependent manner. The
cell cycle effects were not consistent across the cell lines. In the
DHL-4 cell line, a time- and concentration-dependent marked G2M arrest occurred as indicated by an increase in the percentage
number of cells at this phase [0 nmol/L: 20.9 F 1.6% versus EC50
(25 nmol/L): 47.0 F 3.7%; P < 0.001, t test]. This was mirrored by a
decreasing number of cells within the S and G1 phases. Increasing
concentrations of bortezomib and increased duration of exposure
resulted in an emptying of cells from this phase with a consequent
increase in the sub-G1 (apoptotic) cell population (Fig. 4A and C).
In the more sensitive DHL-7 cell lines, a G2-M block did not occur
[DHL-7 (0 nmol/L): 18.6 F 4.8 versus EC50 (6 nmol/L): 18.3 F 4.8].
Instead, a concentration- and duration-dependent increase in
apoptosis was observed with a consequent decrease in the
percentage of cells in the G1 phase. There was no significant
change in the S or G2-M phases of the cell cycle in the DHL-7 cell
lines (Fig. 4A and C ). Treatment with NF-nB inhibitor Bay 11-7082
did not show a G2-M block in the DHL-4 cell line (Fig. 4B and D).
Bortezomib has variable effects on G2-M cell cycle proteins
in DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells. The effect of bortezomib exposure
duration on G2-M cell cycle proteins was investigated after 20, 24,
and 28 h (determined from preliminary experiments; data not
shown). In the DHL-4 cell line, bortezomib treatment resulted in an
increase in cyclin B from 20 h, which was sustained until 28 h.
Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) was not affected by bortezomib.
Although a decrease in Wee-1 was observed in DHL-4 cells, it
remained present throughout these time points of exposure
consistent with cell cycle arrest at G2 (Fig. 4). In the DHL-7 cell
line, bortezomib resulted in a decrease in cyclin B from 20 h and, to
a greater extent, at the 28-h time point. At 20 and 24 h, expression
of Wee-1 reduced and it disappeared by 28 h. Cdk1 levels were also
reduced (Fig. 5).
MPM2 staining shows mitotic catastrophe in more sensitive
DHL-7 cells. MPM2 staining of untreated DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells
revealed cells in all stages of mitosis to be present, although the
number of mitotic cells was reduced in the DHL-4 line (Fig. 6).
After exposure to the EC50 concentration (% viability) of
bortezomib for 28 h, DHL-7 cells continued to enter into mitosis;
however, normal mitosis was not observed. Instead, aberrant
mitosis occurred in a significant proportion of cells, with anaphase
being attempted in cells with incomplete nuclear condensation or
unequal distribution and separation of DNA (Fig. 6B). Similar
changes were observed in treated DHL-4 cells (Fig. 6D), although to
a reduced extent and with far fewer cells entering into mitosis,
consistent with the flow cytometry results.

Discussion
Bortezomib is one of several exciting new agents emerging for
the treatment of malignant lymphoma, having shown 20% to 50%
response rates as a single agent in patients with recurrent,
refractory disease (7, 8, 12). However, the majority of patients do
not respond to single agent therapy and increased understanding
of the mechanism of action of this drug and possible mechanisms
of resistance would be a valuable step toward improving its

Figure 5. Bortezomib causes different effects on G2-M cell cycle proteins in
DHL-4 and DHL-7 cell lines. Cells were treated with EC50 concentrations of
bortezomib for 20, 24, and 28 h, and G2-M cell cycle proteins were examined by
Western blotting. Bortezomib increases cyclin B and maintains Cdk1 and
Wee-1 expression in DHL-4 cells consistent with arrest at G2, whereas, in DHL-7
cells, cyclin B, Cdk1, and Wee-1 were decreased, indicating that cells are
progressing through the G2-M check point. h-Actin was used as a loading

efficacy. Using cell lines with differing sensitivity to bortezomib, we
show that, although bortezomib treatment had similar effects on
apoptotic and NF-nB signaling pathways in these cell lines,
different cell cycle effects were observed and induction of a further
mechanism of cell death, mitotic catastrophe, was observed in the
more sensitive cell line.
In all five lymphoma cell lines studied, bortezomib was cytotoxic
at low nanomolar concentrations, comparable with data from
other studies (9, 11), but differential sensitivity between the lines
was observed, with the most sensitive cell line DHL-7 having an
EC50 of 6 nmol/L compared with 25 nmol/L in the most resistant
DHL-4 cells. Sensitivity was independent of p53 activity as all cell
lines had evidence of nonfunctional mutations and is in keeping
with findings in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) prostate cancer and
myeloma (9, 14, 15). Differences in proteasome activity and
proteasome inhibition were unable to explain differences in
sensitivity to bortezomib, as activity in untreated cells did not
differ between the two cell lines and concentration-dependent
proteasome inhibition was equivalent in DHL-4 and DHL-7 cell
lines at 4 h. At 24 h, there was a trend to greater recovery in the
DHL-4 cell line; however, concentrations that caused significant
sustained inhibition (e.g., 12 nmol/L) were not sufficient to cause
cell death, providing evidence that reaching a ‘‘threshold’’ of
proteasome inhibition does not inevitably result in cell death.
Similar findings have been reported elsewhere (16, 17).
Bortezomib treatment at the EC50 concentration of the DHL-4
and DHL-7 cell lines resulted in apoptosis with cleavage of PARP,
a substrate for active caspase-3, and occurred via activation of
both caspase-8 and caspase-9. Chauhan et al. examined the effects
of bortezomib on DHL-4 cells and a similar lymphoma cell line,
DHL-6. They used a low concentration of bortezomib (10 nmol/L)
that had no effect on DHL-4 cell viability to show that resistance in
the DHL-4 cell line was due to resistance to apoptosis, in turn due
to overexpression of the heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27; ref. 17). In
similar studies, Hideshima et al. (18) showed that bortezomib
treatment of DHL-4 cells did not result in cleavage in caspase-8,
caspase-9, caspase-3, or PARP. Here, we show that DHL-4 cells are
not resistant to bortezomib-induced apoptosis but that a higher

Examination of the Bcl-2 family of proteins revealed that, in
contrast to observations in multiple myeloma cell lines, the
antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was not reduced by bortezomib and,
in fact, an increase was observed in both DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells
(11). In MCL cell lines, no alteration of Bcl-2 protein expression
is observed after bortezomib treatment, but instead, a phosphorylated proapoptotic cleavage product of Bcl-2 is formed, an effect
not observed in these lymphoma cell lines (9). Bortezomib did have
an effect on two proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family
examined. Bax, not expressed in the DHL-4 cell line, was increased
by bortezomib in DHL-7 cells, whereas, in DHL-4 cells, Bak was
increased by bortezomib treatment. The effect of bortezomib on
the Bcl-2 family of proteins did not result in a significant change in
mitochondrial membrane permeability in the DHL-4 cells at 24 h,

but an increase in permeability (due to a decrease in potential) was
observed in DHL-7 cells at the higher concentration (25 nmol/L) of
bortezomib. Several authors have reported up-regulation of Bax as
a result of proteasome inhibition, and cytochrome c release via
elevation of Bax proteins has been observed in Jurkat cells (19, 20).
In MCL cell lines, bortezomib treatment does not result in an
overall increase in Bax or Bak expression but conformational
changes consistent with their activation are observed (21). There,
bortezomib also induced a decrease in Bid protein level as a
consequence of its cleavage mediated by caspase-3 activation.
These data suggest that, in some cell lines, different proapoptotic
proteins are up-regulated to increase mitochondrial membrane
permeability with the subsequent release of cytochrome c and
induction of apoptosis. The absence of a decrease in MMP in
DHL-4 cells may partially explain resistance to apoptosis in the
DHL-4 cells. However, this cannot fully explain differences in

Figure 6. Staining with the
immunofluorescent antibody MPM2 shows
that the more sensitive DHL-7 cells are
progressing into mitosis and undergoing
mitotic catastrophe. DHL-4 and DHL-7
cells were treated with EC50 concentrations
of bortezomib, and cytospins of untreated
and treated cells were prepared. After
permeabilization, cells were incubated with
anti-phospho-Ser/Thr-MPM2 overnight
and, after exposure to PE-conjugated
anti-mouse secondary antibody and the
DNA stain, DAPI, viewed under a
fluorescence microscope. MPM2-positive
cells stain red and the DNA stain, DAPI,
appears blue . Untreated DHL-7 (A) and
DHL-4 (C ) cells show mitosis proceeding
normally, with some cells staining positive
for MPM2 with normal chromatid
separation and chromosome migration.
B, in bortezomib-treated DHL-7 cells,
mitosis continues to occur as cells stain
positive for MPM2, but mitosis is aberrant
and cells show various abnormalities (three
examples shown) resulting in asymmetrical
distribution of DNA. D , there are fewer cells
undergoing mitosis in DHL-4–treated
cultures, consistent with the G2-arrested
population shown in Fig. 4A .

sensitivity between the cell lines, as the EC50 concentration of
DHL-7 failed to induce a significant change in the permeability at
this time point.
As inhibition of NF-nB is thought to be an important mediator of
activity of bortezomib, its effects were compared with that of a
specific inhibitor, Bay 11-7082. In MCL cell lines and primary
cultures, NF-nB inhibition seems to play a significant role, as similar
effects are observed with Bay 11-7082 and bortezomib (9). In the
DHL-4 and DHL-7 cell lines, the effect of bortezomib was found not
to be solely attributable to its effect on NF-nB activity, as equipotent
concentrations (with respect to % viability) of Bay 11-7082 resulted
in greater NF-nB inhibition than bortezomib. In addition, no
differences were found between the cell lines with either drug.
One of the most striking findings of the study was that
bortezomib treatment resulted in a G2-M cell cycle arrest in
DHL-4 cell line, an effect not observed in the DHL-7 cell line, or
either cell line with the specific NF-nB inhibitor. The proteasome is
intimately involved in regulation of progression of the cell cycle
from G2 into mitosis through the temporal degradation of both
positive and negative regulators of this process (22). Inhibition of
the proteasome may therefore result in several effects, and cell
cycle proteins involved in this transition were investigated to see
whether it could explain any differences between the two cell lines.
In the DHL-4 cell line where a G2-M arrest was observed, cyclin B
increased and Wee-1 (a mitotic inhibitory protein) degradation was
prevented (22). Cyclin B is normally broken down by proteasomemediated degradation during metaphase, and increased expression
is observed during G2 due to increased transcription. These results
provide confirmatory evidence, in addition to the cell cycle
distribution data, that bortezomib treatment results in the arrest
of DHL-4 cells at the G2-M checkpoint. Chauhan et al. (17) showed
that the DHL-4 cell line overexpresses Hsp27 and it was this that
mediates resistance to bortezomib, as inhibition of Hsp27 using
small interfering RNA led to increased sensitivity to bortezomib
and transfection of Hsp27 into sensitive DHL-6 cells conferred
resistance. Hsp27 is known to prevent cells from undergoing
apoptosis by preventing release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria; thus, it may contribute to resistance to bortezomib,
but as little change in MMP was observed in the DHL-7 cell line,
this effect cannot offer the only explanation. It is, however, possible
that induction of Hsp27 (or other Hsps) may contribute to the
differences in cell cycle effects observed in the cell lines, as Hsp27
overexpression has been shown in ovarian cells treated with
etoposide or vincristine, which was shown to correlate with growth
arrest and G2-M accumulation (23). In a preliminary analysis of
gene expression profiling of DHL-4 and DHL-7 cells done at this

institution, DHL-4 cells were again found to overexpress Hsp27
with increased expression after treatment (data not shown). It is
thus possible that a checkpoint protein, such as chk1, may be a
Hsp27 client and an increase in Hsp27 acts to produce the G2 arrest
observed in the DHL-4 cells.
In DHL-7 cells, bortezomib treatment resulted in degradation of
cyclin B and Wee-1 and staining with MPM2 provided evidence that
DHL-7 cells had entered into mitosis. Aberrant mitosis, however,
seemed to have occurred as haphazard asymmetrical segregation of
chromatid clusters in abnormal-appearing anaphase was observed.
These findings are consistent with a form of cell death called
‘‘mitotic catastrophe,’’ a term used to describe cell death that occurs
from aberrant mitosis (24, 25). Several key regulatory proteins, such
as the aurora kinases and other chromosomal passenger proteins,
are involved in regulating chromatid segregation and chromosome
migration. Proteasome inhibition may have a marked effect on the
degradation of these regulatory proteins, or their substrates,
resulting in the abnormal mitotic cells observed.
Some reports indicate that mitotic catastrophe shares a
common pathway with apoptosis-induced cell death, whereas
others report that it is an independent pathway (26, 27). It is likely
that mitotic catastrophe in apoptosis-competent cells is followed
by apoptosis as was observed in these cell lines (28). A similar
phenomenon has been described in bortezomib-treated non–small
cell lung cancer cell lines (29).
Malignant cells often have cell cycle checkpoint abnormalities,
and this may be why they are particularly susceptible to the
induction of mitotic catastrophe (30). The studies reported here
show the cell-specific effects of bortezomib and provide some
pointers to the difference in sensitivity between cell lines. It seems
that DHL-7 cells abrogate the G2-M checkpoint with consequent
mitotic catastrophe and cell death, whereas, in the DHL-4 cells,
activation of the G2-M checkpoint may allow repair of damaged
DNA, thereby reducing sensitivity to the drug. An improved
understanding of control of the checkpoint may help identify
targets to increase the efficacy of bortezomib in cells less sensitive
to the drug. The use of RNA interference may be helpful to
determine which of these changes are crucial to the cytotoxic effects
of bortezomib.
