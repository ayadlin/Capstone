ABSTRACT
Recent scientific advances have increased our understanding of the cancer
metastatic complexities and provided further impetus for new combination therapies
to prevent cancer metastasis. Here, we demonstrated that a combination (HAMPT)
of aspirin, lysine, mifepristone and doxycycline can effectively and safely prevent
cancer metastasis. The pharmaceutically-formulated HAMPT inhibited adhesion of
cancer cells to either endothelial cells or extracellular matrix via down-regulating
cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and α4-integrin. HAMPT inhibited the cloak effect by
activated platelets on cancer cells, thereby interfering adhesion and invasion of cancer
cells to the underlying stroma. At the effective concentration, HAMPT induced cancer
cells into dormancy with minor inhibition on cell viability. Four-day pretreatment
followed by 30-day oral administration of HAMPT (33.5-134 mg/kg) to the mice
inoculated with cancer cells produced significant inhibition on cancer metastasis dosedependently without marked side effects. Fifty-day rat toxicity study with HAMPT
at doses (335-1340 mg/kg) 20-fold higher than its therapeutic dose produced no
significant toxicity. Interestingly, the acute toxic death could not be reached at the
maximum administrable dose (5 g/kg). This proof-of-concept study provides the first
conceptual evidence that cancer metastasis can be controlled by using affordable
old drugs to restrain circulating tumor cells from gemmating on the metastatic soil
without the need for cytotoxicity.

INTRODUCTION

[3], which is the daily threat to the cancer survivors,
among them 30-70% will eventually face the metastatic
nightmares within 2-5 years after surgery.
The root cause of cancer metastasis can be traced
down to the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
or tumor-specific DNA in the blood of cancer survivors
[4]. CTCs in cancer survivors often show a low rate of
proliferation when cancer survivors are in remission

The increased number of cancer survivors is the
cause for celebration [1], but this expanding population
has highlighted the problem of cancer relapse and
metastasis after surgical removal of the primary tumors
[2]. Indeed, the emergence of disseminated metastases
remains the primary cause of mortality in cancer patients

and/or asymptomatic [5-6]. Thus current post-metastatic
chemotherapeutic agents that are originally designed
to target highly proliferating cancer cells could also be
destructive to proliferating non-cancer cells, resulting
in intolerable side effects. Hence, chemotherapeutics
cannot be used in the asymptomatic cancer survivors
[7]. When CTCs become activated, however, treatments
directed against metastasis are too late because CTCs have
already spread and seeded to various vulnerable tissues
[8-9]. At that moment it is nearly impossible to stop or
reverse the devastating cascade of cancer metastasis by
using chemotherapeutics, partially due to the acquired or
inherent resistance of the CTCs to the chemotherapeutics
[10]. As a matter of fact, anticancer chemotherapy
sometimes enhances metastasis formation [11]. Worse off,
the activated CTCs possess more heterogeneity and drug
tolerance than the normal cells [12].
Following logical dissection on the cancer
metastasis pathways using tools of systems biology and
systems pharmacology [13], we depict that primary tumor
cells separate from neighboring epithelial cell-cell contacts
and become the CTCs. They travel in a unidirectional path
in the circulation, reside in the bone marrow and lymph
node, and ultimately colonize distant organs to form
the pre-metastatic niche or repopulate the primary site
through self-seeding [9]. Many local microenvironment
factors collectively decide whether and where CTCs
colonize. These factors [14] include tumor-derived or
locally-produced inflammatory factors [chemoattractants,
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)], the diameter of
capillary vessels, activated platelets that escort CTCs
from immune cell recognition and attack, fibroblasts that
upregulate fibronectin to establish a docking site for CTCs,
immunosuppressive cell types such as Myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs) and natural killer cells (NK)
that populate premetastatic niches permissive to CTCs
colonization, acidification and adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) production, activities of cell adhesion molecules,
integrins, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP). On the other hand, if CTCs
fail to adhere to the vascular endothelium, they may die
through the blood shear stress, or a process termed anoikis,
one form of detachment-induced apoptotic program that
has been characterized in suspension cell cultures [15].
We proposed that the initiation of CTC adhesion to the
local vascular endothelium is the first and important step
for CTCs to start the metastatic cascade. Inhibition of
the initial step may thus prevent consequential formation
of the metastasis foci [16]. We then demonstrated
that metapristone (the active mifepristone metabolite)
has a safe and effective profile as a cancer metastasis
chemopreventive agent by inhibiting adhesion of CTCs
to vascular endothelium [17]. Very recently, we further
demonstrated that both the extracts from the medicinal
plant Murraya exotica and the engineered dual antibody
coated nanomaterials have the similar safe and effective
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

profile of inhibiting adhesion of CTCs to vascular
endothelium [18-19].
Based on the above understanding of cancer
metastatic processes, we designed, accordingly, a
quadruple combination drug HAMPT (standing for highly
active metastasis prevention therapy), which is consisted
of mifepristone (RU486), aspirin, lysine and doxycycline.
Each component of HAMPT targets the above-mentioned
local microenvironment factors to comprehensively and
synergistically interfere with cancer metastasis pathways.
Here, we report pharmaceutical preparation and analysis
of the HAMPT combination, its in vitro effects on cell
viability and cycle distribution, adhesion between cancer
and endothelial cells, cloak effect by the activated platelets
on cancer cells, and expression of adhesion molecules.
We also conducted the in vivo experiments to analyze
synergistic effect of HAMPT on the well-established
Humphries’s metastasis animal model [20], and examined
the long-term safety profile of HAMPT.

RESULTS
No physicochemical interaction among the
ingredients
To rule out physicochemical interactions among the
individual active ingredients in HAMPT, we examined
differences in chromatogram and peak areas of each
ingredient alone, or in the HAMPT mixture at room
temperature incubated in the same solvent for 24 h.
The final concentration of each ingredient alone and in
the mixture was kept same. As shown in Figure 1, each
ingredient, whether it is in a single one or mixed with other
drugs, exhibited the similar chromatogram, peak areas and
retention times under the same chromatographic conditions
as well as mass ionization and spectrometric conditions.
The result indicated no significant physicochemical drugdrug interaction among these ingredients after they were
mixed in the solvent under the preparation condition.

HAMPT primarily inhibits CTC adhesion with
minor effect on cell viability
The adhesion and invasion of CTCs to endothelial
cells are considered as the important initial step of distant
cancer metastasis. We first examined the effect of HAMPT
on cell hetero-adhesion between human endothelial cells
and cancer cells M619. After co-incubation of M619
with HUVECs, the fluorescent quantification (Figure 2A)
revealed that HAMPT produced significant inhibition on
the adhesion in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A, 2B).
For example, at 50 µg/mL, HAMPT inhibited adhesion
of M619 to HUVECs activated by interleukin-1 beta (IL1β) by 37.3 ± 9.5 % in comparison with the control. IL35158

1β is commonly used in the static adhesion assay in this
laboratory because it enhances expression of adhesion
proteins vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on
endothelium [16].
We then assessed the effect of HAMPT on adhesion
of cancer cells B16-F10 and M619 to Matrigel that was
used as the artificial extracellular membrane (ECM) [17].
MTT assay revealed that HAMPT inhibited adhesion of
both human and mouse melanoma cancer cells to Matrigel
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C). For instance,
the adhesion of M619 and B16-F10 cells to Matrigel was
inhibited by 41.8 ± 3.4 and 37.7 ± 7.6 %, respectively, in
the presence of 50 µg/mL HAMPT (P < 0.01).
The effect of HAMPT on cell viability was
examined on mouse melanoma B16-F10 and human
melanoma M619 cell lines, respectively. HAMPT at doses
of 1, 10, 30, and 50 µg/mL did not produce statistically
significant changes in viability of the two cell lines.
However, when HAMPT concentration was increased
to 100 µg/mL, a statistically significant inhibition on the
growth of these cell lines was observed in comparison

with the untreated controls (Figure 2D).
To quantitatively characterize a cancer metastasis
chemopreventive that is different from cytotoxic anticancer
drugs in the mechanism by which a cancer metastasis
chemopreventive inhibits adhesion of cancer cells to
endothelial cells, instead of killing cells, we herein created
the adhesion inhibition ratio (AIR) to define this type of
drugs. The ratio is calculated by dividing IC10 (the mean
drug concentration causing a 10% growth inhibition of the
cells) by EC50 (the mean drug concentration causing a 50%
inhibition of the hetero-adhesion between cancer cells and
endothelial cells). The larger the AIR is, the more likely
the drug works as a cancer metastasis chemopreventive by
inhibiting the hetero-adhesion, rather than as a cytotoxic
drug that inhibits the cell hetero-adhesion by cell killing
and may have side effects. As shown in Figure 2E, the
AIR value of HAMPT in inhibiting growth of M619
and its adhesion to HUVECs is 3.36. The AIR values of
HAMPT in inhibiting growth of M619 and B16-F10 and
their corresponding adhesion to Matrigel are 6.22 and
1.62, respectively. The result indicates that the cellular
mechanism of HAMPT is by, primarily, directly inhibiting

dissolved in methanol-water solvent (5:1; v/v) at the final concentration of 10 μg/mL alone (A.-a, b, c and B.-a) or in the mixture (A.-d
and B.-b) for 24 h at room temperature. Chromatogram, peak areas and retention times of individual ingredients and their mixture were
determined by the HPLC method (for mifepristone, aspirin and doxycycline hyclate) and UPLC-MS/MS (for lysine).

for another 24 h. HAMPT down-regulated ICAM-1
expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A, 3B)
by 63.3 ± 4.0 % (10 μg/mL) and 52.7 ± 3.2 % (50 μg/mL).
Whereas, HAMPT (1, 10, 30 and 50 μg/mL) did not show
significant dose-dependent down-regulation of VCAM-1
expression (Figure 3C). Flow cytometric analysis revealed
that ɑ4 integrin is an adhesion ligand expressed on the
surface of B16-F10 cells and HAMPT caused a significant
decrease in ɑ4 integrin expression by 57.7 ± 3.2 % at 50
μg/mL in the B16-F10 cells (Figure 3D).

HAMPT prevents cancer cells from cloaked or
aggregated by platelets
The flow cytometry analysis showed that M619 was
EpCAM+CD61-, whereas, platelets were EpCAM-CD61+.
Therefore, the platelet-cloaked cancer cell aggregates
should be EpCAM+CD61+. When the platelets were at rest,
the EpCAM+CD61+ platelet-cloaked M619 aggregates
were rarely to be detected. However, once activated
by ADP after 10 min incubation, the platelet-cloaked
M619 aggregates were significantly increased. HAMPT
caused a significant concentration-dependent decrease in
platelet-cloaked M619 aggregates by 75.2± 13.7 (1 µg/
mL), 57.3± 6.9 (10 µg/mL) and 39.1± 13.2% (30 µg/mL),
respectively, compared to the ADP-activated platelets in
the absence of HAMPT (Figure 2F). The present study
indicated that HAMPT inhibited platelet-cloaked M619
aggregation induced by ADP. It is well-demonstrated that
platelets contribute to tumor metastasis [21].

Analyses of different combinations and the related
additive and synergistic effects
The metastasis-preventing activity of HAMPT
was tested using previously characterized experimental
metastatic murine model [20]. Briefly, B16-F10 murine
melanoma cells (3×104/mice), a line for high colonization
in vivo, were injected into the lateral tail vein of C57BL/6
mice. To optimize the combination strategies for the most
potent inhibition on the lung metastasis, mifepristone,
aspirin, lysine and doxycycline hyclate were orally
administered to the lung metastatic mouse model alone,
or in dual or triple combination for 30 days, and the
metastatic inhibition effects of different combinations
were evaluated based on the medium dose of HAMPT
(67 mg/kg/day). As shown in Figure 4 A and 4B, HAMPT
exhibited the most potent inhibition on the lung metastasis
(the far right bar), followed by triple combinations (the
green bars), and then dual combinations (the purple bars).
The result confirmed the pharmacological necessity of
the four drug combination to comprehensively inhibit
cancer metastasis. We then used the following equation
to determine if the individual combination was additive
or synergistic based on the in vivo experimental therapy
data: q = EA+B/EA+EB-EA×EB [22], where, EA+B, EA, and
EB denote the average inhibitory effects of any drug A
and B combined, or alone, on the number of lung tumor
nodules and lung weight. When the q is ≤0.85, the result
suggests an antagonism between the combination; when
the q is 0.85 < q < 1.15, an additive effect; and q≥1.15, a
synergistic effect between the combination. As analyzed
and shown in Table S1, there was no antagonism between
different combinations, and many combinations can be
categorized as “additive”, including HAMPT, and some,
as “synergistic”.

Effect of HAMPT on cell cycle distribution
Cell growth in tumor is carefully controlled by
regulating the cell cycle. To further determine how
HAMPT affect the viability of M619 and B16-F10 cells,
cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry to
reveal the percentage of the cells arrested in the phases
of G0/G1, S, and G2/M, respectively, after HAMPT
treatment. The results indicated that HAMPT produced
a concentration-dependent increase in M619 (Figure 2G)
and B16-F10 (Figure 2H) cell population in G0/G1 phase,
and decreases in the cell population in S and G2/M phases,
suggesting that HAMPT could drive cells into a resting
phase (G0) where the cells have left the cycle and stop
dividing, or into G1 phase where they are ready for DNA
synthesis, while decrease cell population in DNA synthesis
and mitosis.

Inhibition by HAMPT on expression of cell
adhesion molecules
Since HAMPT was defined as a cancer metastasis
chemopreventive combination that showed high AIR
and specifically inhibited the cell hetero-adhesion, we
explored if HAMPT could affect the expression of those
cell adhesion molecules by using flow cytometry as we
described previously [16-17]. In Figure 3A, the FACS
histogram of a typical experiment showed the effect of
HAMPT on IL-1β-induced ICAM-1 expression illustrated
by fluorescence intensity on the X-axis and % of maximum
on the Y-axis. The HUVECs were pretreated with 1 ng/
mL IL-1β for 4 h, followed by treatment with HAMPT

Inhibition of in vivo cancer metastasis by HAMPT
treatment
We then determined the optimal dose for the
HAMPT combination based on optimal metastasispreventing benefit, i.e., affordability, maximal efficacy
and a minimal toxicity [23], and re-appraised the doses of
those agents that have already become the standard of care

individual drug were chosen to cover wider therapeutic
window and explore dose-related efficacy and toxicity.
Thirty-day treatment with HAMPT diminished the
lung metastasis in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4).
Confocal imaging after staining for vascular endothelium

harbored large lung metastatic lesions that had efficiently

toxic signs occurred after administration of HAMPT were
monitored continuously for 1 h and then intermittently for
4 h after the oral administration. The mice were closely
observed over a period of 24 h and for a period of 14 days.
No deaths or hazardous signs were observed during the
14-day study.
For the subacute toxicity study, the Sprague-Dawley
rats (5 males, 5 females per group) were administered
with oral HAMPT (335, 670 and 1340 mg/kg/day) for
50 days, and their body weights were recorded weekly
(Figure 5A, 5B) No toxic signs (such as piloerection,
unusual locomotor activity) were observed during the
subacute toxicity study. The rats were sacrificed on the
51st day, the blood samples were collected from common
carotid for blood chemistry analysis (Table 1), and major
tissues were freshly harvested and fixed in 10% buffered
formaldehyde solution (Figure 5C, 5D, 5E). Following the
histopathological processes, the tissues were stained with
H&E and examined microscopically. In general, the body
weight gain of the treated rats was normal in comparison
with the control group except that the female rats receiving

manipulating the primary tumor. Hardly any cancer
therapies used at the moment interfere only with metastasis
and there is an urgent need for drugs acting specifically
on the metastatic processes, curing the minimal residual
disease and being much less toxic than the current drugs
[28]. As the molecular understanding of the biological
functions necessary for metastasis increases, it becomes
important to develop a comprehensive cancer metastasis
chemoprevention strategy that targets not only the intrinsic
growth of disseminated CTCs, but also their necessary
adhesion and invasion to endothelial layer in the distant
metastatic organs, including the bone marrow. Most of
CTCs die in the circulation, presumably due to the loss of
matrix-derived survival signals, circulatory shear stress, or
anoikis [16]. Mifepristone, aspirin, lysine and doxycycline
hyclate work differently at distinct metastatic targets and
pathways.
Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist
that has been widely used as the abortifacient and in anticancer trials [29]. We have comprehensively updated
the information about the clinical trials of mifepristone
[29]. Mifepristone prevented or delayed mammary
tumorigenesis in the Brca1/p53-deficient mice [30],
produced cancer cellular apoptosis by acting on p53 and
B-cell lymphocyte/ leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins
[31], and induced a significant time- and dose-dependent
cytotoxicity in both human androgen-sensitive LNCaP
and androgen-insensitive PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer
cell lines [32]. The inhibition of mifepristone is associated
with a significant increase in DNA fragmentation, downregulation of Bcl-2, and induction of TGF-beta 1 protein.
It has been shown that mifepristone inhibited the invasive
and metastatic potential of tumor cells through inhibition
of the heterotypic adhesion to basement membrane,
cell migration and angiogenesis [33]. Our latest study
showed that mifepristone prevented colorectal HT-29
and breast MDA-MB-231 cell lines from migration, and
interfered with the adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial
cells [17]. Besides, mifepristone significantly decreased
expression of focal adhesion kinase that is related to cell
spreading and survival. Interestingly, it seems like that
there are some similarity between embryo implantation
and tumor metastasis [34], which constructs the base
for the abortifacient mifepristone to act as a metastatic
chemopreventive. Patients already took mifepristone for
as long as 14 years [35]. The safety profile of mifepristone
makes it well-suited for a safe metastatic chemopreventive
candidate.
Aspirin is a widely-used anti-inflammatory drug,
which inhibit COX-2 [also known as prostaglandin
endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2, or HGNC9605)]. Use
of aspirin that inhibits platelet activation in the colon
cancer cases is associated with improved overall survival
[36]. Aspirin is a potential adjuvant therapy to prevent
distant metastasis in colorectal cancer, and possible
other cancers [37]. The targets on which the beneficial

DISCUSSION
There is a compelling rationale for use of a
combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action
to target both a primary and compensatory pathway
for cancer metastasis chemoprevention to minimize
toxicity and maximize efficacy. In the present study,
we demonstrated that HAMPT could be formulated in
a novel quadruple drug combination without obvious
physiochemical drug-drug interaction. The combination
prevented and inhibited cancer metastasis in the wellvalidated animal model in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4) through its inhibition on cell hetero-adhesion
between cancer and endothelia cells (Figure 2) The
inhibition included down regulation by HAMPT of
ICAM-1 and integrin expression (Figure 3), the cloak
effect (Figure 2F) caused by activated platelets to protect
CTCs from immune attack and facilitate CTCs adhesion
to endothelial cells for their subsequent gemmating and
invasion to the underlying stroma. HAMPT also shows
its ability to induce CTCs into cellular dormancy via a G0/
G1 arrest or differentiation (Figure 2G) [27], and minor
inhibition on cell viability. Thirty-day treatment of the
mice with HAMPT (33.5, 67, 134 mg/kg/day) did not
produce any significant drug-related organ toxicity, which
was further confirmed by the 50-day subacute (5 g/kg) and
the acute toxicity (335, 670 and 1340 mg/kg/day) studies.
These data strongly suggest that HAMPT is a good cancer
metastasis chemopreventive that could comprehensively
and synergistically interfere with metastasis pathways
while possessing a good safety profile.

with low doses (75-325 mg once daily), are inadequate
to permanently acetylate COX-2 but are optimal for
its metastatic chemoprevention through inhibition of
platelet activation and thrombocytosis [38], inhibition of
MMP-2 activity and increase in E-cadherin production
[39], down-regulation of an epithelial-mesenchymal-

like phenotype [40], and inhibition of platelet-mediated
nuclear factor-kB signaling in CTCs. We demonstrated
that HAMPT exerted an inhibitory effect on ADPinduced platelet activation that could cloak CTCs from
host immune attack and facilitate adhesion of CTCs to
endothelium for consequent metastasis. Collectively,
aspirin in HAMPT could inhibit adhesion and invasion of
CTCs to the vascular endothelium and their intravascular
micrometastasis formation. Regular aspirin intake has

that can be surgically removed. The residual disease may be detectable for long periods before the tumor seeds in distant secondary organs.
To systematically prevent and restrain cancer metastasis, a true cancer metastasis chemoprevention combination drug should be safe,
affordable, and synergistically target multiple metastatic pathways including both “seeds” and “soil”. B. the mechanisms of actions of
HAMPT ingredients. Mifepristone produces cancer cell apoptosis by acting on various apoptosis-related targets; it inhibits adhesion and
invasion of CTCs to vascular stroma by acting at both CTCs and endothelial cells as well as focal adhesion kinase. Aspirin inhibits COX-2
resulting in inhibition of platelet activation and thrombocytosis, and inhibition of cloak effect by platelet on CTCs. Doxycycline may inhibit
the change from osteoblasts to osteoclasts, and interfere with bone marrow microenvironment to interrupt the reservoir for disseminating
carcinoma. Both aspirin and doxycycline have the anti-inflammatory effect that is important for cancer metastasis prevention. Lysine

MATERIALS AND METHODS

been shown to reduce risk of distant metastasis by 30-40%
and reduce risk of metastatic adenocarcinoma by almost
half [41-42]. We, therefore, propose that aspirin may be a
good metastasis chemopreventive ingredient of HAMPT.
Doxycycline hyclate has been safely used as
antibiotics effectively for decades [43]. It also exhibits
antitumor activity in some tumor models and has potential
for preventing bone metastasis and inhibiting cancer cell
proliferation [44-45]. Doxycycline is also a potent MMP
inhibitor and highly osteotropic [46-47]. Doxycycline
has been shown to play an important role in reduction or
prevention of cancer bone metastasis in preclinical and
clinical settings [48].
Lysine is an essential amino acid and regarded as
a non-bicarbonate/ non-volatile buffer with a higher pKa
at 10. Lysine inhibits MMPs, strengthens connective
tissue surrounding cancer cells (tumor encapsulating
effect), and reverses the acidity surrounding the CTCs
microenvironment [49-50]. Animals treated with lysine
for six weeks lived significantly longer than animals on
tap water [51]. We considered lysine in HAMPT as a “soilstrengthening” agent that buffers the acidic extracellular
pH, decreases proteolytic enzyme activity, and increases
the ECM integrity. All of these could collectively lead to
inhibition of CTCs extravasations and colonization.
Based on the evidence available in the literature
and our own research [17], as well as the present study,
we hypothesized that a combination of mifepristone,
aspirin, lysine and doxycycline hyclate could work at a
much lower but safe and effective concentration to prevent
human cancer metastasis. The quantitative analysis
of various combinations concludes that the quadruple
combination HAMPT reached the maximum inhibition on
tumor metastasis to lungs (Figure 4A, 4B).
On the basis of the findings from this study, we
propose a consolidated model that illustrates a plausible
sequence of events that orchestrate the mechanisms of
actions of HAMPT in preventing and inhibiting cancer
metastasis (Figure 6A, 6B). This model elucidates the
potential role of HAMPT in controlling cancer metastasis
cascade by acting on both the seeds and soil, and
highlights the importance of using the safe and affordable
drugs for long-term cancer metastasis chemoprevention
after surgical removal of a primary tumor.
Old drugs may be “repurposed” for new indications
and studied to determine the mechanisms of their
beneficial and adverse effects [52]. A rational combination
of those old and hence well-demonstrated effective and
safe old drugs would be invaluable for cancer metastatic
chemoprevention because the safety is the number one
concern for those asymptomatic cancer survivors. The use
of the affordable, safe, and efficient HAMPT that can be
manufactured in a large quantity could theoretically and
practically provide a rational basis for cancer metastasis
chemoprevention, an important area that has been ignored
for too long.

HAMPT composition
Stock solution of HAMPT is composed of the
following: aspirin 75 mg (Aladdin Reagent Company,
China), lysine 200 mg (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., China), mifepristone 10 mg (Shanghai New Hualian
Co., China), and doxycycline hyclate 50 mg (Shanghai
Civi Chemical Technology Co., China). Drug doses were
chosen based on the human doses of the four drugs [36,
51, 53-54] and converted to mouse doses according to the
body surface area index [24]. The concentrations of the
four drugs used in the in vitro assay were chosen based on
the same dose ratio of the four drugs composed and used
in the animal studies. The combination was so formulated
to target different pathways of cancer metastasis.

Drug-drug interaction analysis by HPLC and
UPLC-MS/MS
To determine whether physicochemical drug-drug
interaction exists among the four drugs, we developed and
validated the HPLC and UPLC-MS/MS methods similar
to what we reported previously [17]. Briefly, the individual
drugs were mixed in methanol-water 5:1 (v/v) at the same
concentration as a single drug, i.e., 10 µg/mL. The HPLC
system was composed of Waters 2695 pump equipped with
Waters 2475 UV detector. Chromatographic separation
was conducted on an analytical column (5 μm, 4.6×5 mm,
Sigma Amide) using the mobile phase consisting of 0.1%
formic acid in ultrapure water-methanol (30:70, v/v) at a
flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injection volume was 20 µL
and detection wavelength was at 280 nm.
UPLC-MS/MS analysis was carried out on a Waters
H-class liquid chromatograph interfaced with XEVOTQD Mass Spectrometer (Waters) equipped with heated
capillary interface, electrospray ionization (ESI) source,
and a tandem quadrupole mass detector. The ESI system
employed a 3-kv spray voltage (positive polarity) and a
heated capillary at 340°C. The auxiliary gas (nitrogen)
flow rate was set to 1 L/min, cone voltage 27 V. The
optimized collision energy was 25 V for lysine. The ESI
was optimized using lysine as a reference compound. The
mass chromatograms were acquired in total ion current
(TIC) modality in MRM mode of the transitions of m/z
146.9→84.6 for lysine. Chromatographic analysis was
the same as the HPLC condition except that the injection
volume was 5 µL and the flow rate was 0.2 mL/min.

Cell viability and cell cycle analyses

The cell lines we used in our experiments were
authenticated. The cell culture method were shown in
supplementary materials.

The viability assay was similar to what we described
previously [56]. Briefly, the melanoma B16-F10 and
M619 cells were cultured as usual in 96-well plates at
8×103 cells/well, and incubated with HAMPT (0-100 μg/
mL) for 24 h at 37°C before the 4-h MTT assay. The result
was read at OD570nm on an ELISA reader. The untreated
control was considered 100% viability.
The cell cycle was analyzed as we described before
[57]. Briefly, M619 and B16-F10 cells were separately
treated with different concentrations of HAMPT (0, 10,
30 and 50 µg/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested,
washed twice with PBS and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol
overnight, and then spun to remove ethanol before cellular
DNA staining with the fluorescent solution (1% (v/v)
Triton X-100, 0.01% RNase, 0.05% PI) for 30 min at 37°C
in darkness. The cell cycle distribution was determined by
flow cytometry.

Hetero-adhesion of cancer cells to the endothelial
cells and matrigel
Quantification of cancer cell adhesion to endothelial
cells and MatrigelTM (BD) was performed as we described
previously with minor modifications [55]. Briefly, the
human melanoma cells M619 transfected with the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) were co-cultured with the human
umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) pretreated
with IL-1β (1 ng/mL) for 4 h in the 24-well tissue culture
plates. The human melanoma M619 and mouse melanoma
B16-F10 cells were also cultured separately on the 96well plates coated with Matrigel. The cell lines were
treated with different concentrations of HAMPT for 1 h.
The wells were washed with PBS, and the fluorescence
signal of the M619-GFP cells attached to the HUVECs
was recorded using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) to
determine the effect of HAMPT on cell-cell adhesion,
or the MTT assay was applied to determine the effect of
HAMPT on adhesion of both human and mouse melanoma
cells to Matrigel by using our method [17].

Cell adhesion molecules analysis by flow
cytometry
This experiment was conducted as we described
previously [16]. Briefly, the well-grown HUVECs were
pretreated with IL-1β (1 ng/mL) for 4 h followed by
HAMPT treatment for 4 h. The cells were collected and
incubated at 4°C for 30 min in the dark with the primary
antibodies. B16-F10 cells were treated with HAMPT for
24 h without IL-1β followed by incubation with antimouse CD49d-FITC antibodies (1:50 dilution) for 30 min
at 4°C. Expression of cell-surface ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and
α4 integrin (fibronectin receptor) was measured by the
FACS AriaIII flow cytometer. The data were processed by
FlowJo software and expressed as the mean fluorescent
intensities.

Cancer cells cloaked by platelets
Blood was collected from healthy volunteers who
had not taken any anticoagulants for at least 14 days
prior to the study. Blood (1.8 mL) was added to the blood
collection tubes containing 0.2 mL of anticoagulator
sodium citrate (106 mM), and gently invert-mixed. Cancer
cells were harvested after incubated with 0.25% trypsin
solution and resuspended in PBS (2×106 cells/mL). The
cloak effect of platelets on cancer cells was measured by
the flow cytometry. Briefly, HAMPT (0, 1, 10 and 30 μg/
mL) and M619 cells (2×105 cells) were added to 100 μL
blood samples in falcon tubes followed by addition of ADP
(20 μM) to stimulate the platelet aggregation. After 10
min incubation at 25 oC, 20 μL mouse anti-human CD61
(FITC-labeled) and 20 μL mouse anti-human epithelial
cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, PE-labeled) were added
to the tubes, respectively. The mixture was incubated for
20 min at 25 oC in the dark followed by addition of 1 mL
ice-cold 1% paraformaldehyde for fixture. After 30 min
incubation of the samples at 4 oC, cancer cells cloaked by
platelets were determined by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS), and only the CD61+EpCAM+ cancer cells
were considered platelet-cloaked cancer cells. The data
were processed by FlowJo software and expressed as the
number of CD61+EpCAM+ cells.

In vivo metastasis assay
All the drugs in this experiment were dissolved
in 0.5% Carboxy Methyl Cellulose-Na (CMC-Na,
purchased from Sinoharm Chemical Reagent Co., China)
as a suspension. The mice were randomly divided into 4
groups (n = 6 per group), including CMC-Na (control)
and HAMPT (33.5, 67 and 134 mg/kg/day) groups. The
chemopreventive HAMPT was given by gavage for 4 days
before B16-F10 inoculation followed by 30-day treatment.
The immune-intact C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with
the minimal metastatic B16-F10 cells (3×104/0.2 mL/
mice). Thirty days after the inoculation, the mice were
sacrificed, and their lungs were excised. The number of
surface melanoma colonies was counted visually with
the aid of a dissecting microscope. The livers were also
dissected, fixed in 10% (v/v) buffered formaldehyde.

Sections of the lungs were stained with hematoxylin-eosin
(H&E) to confirm that the nodules were malignant and to
monitor the presence of micro-metastases foci. Sections
of livers were used to determine whether HAMPT caused
toxicity to livers. Overall survival of the mice treated with
or without HAMPT were estimated using Kaplan-Meier
survival curves as described by Xie et al [58].
Survival times were calculated from the date
of inoculation. Mice that died before the end of the
experiment were examined at the time of death to analyze
the reasons of death. Cox proportional hazards and logistic
regression models were fitted to identify the factors
significantly associated with the survival rates.

Synergistic or additive combination test in vivo
To examine the synergistic or additive effect among
the four drugs, dual and triple combinations were made
among the four drugs, and their effects were compared
with that of HAMPT in vivo. The dose chosen for the test
was the median dose of each individual drug in HAMPT
(mifepristone 2 mg/kg/day, aspirin 15 mg/kg/day, lysine
40 mg/kg/day and doxycycline hyclate 10 mg/kg/day)
and the experiment was conducted the same as described
above in the in vivo metastasis assay.
