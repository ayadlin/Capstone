Abstract

Introduction

To potentiate the response of acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML) cells to tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) cytotoxicity, we have examined the
efficacy of a combination with perifosine, a novel phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling inhibitor. The rationale for using such a combination is that perifosine was
recently described to increase TRAIL-R2 receptor expression
and decrease the cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (cFLIP) in
human lung cancer cell lines. Perifosine and TRAIL both
induced cell death by apoptosis in the THP-1 AML cell line,
which is characterized by constitutive PI3K/Akt activation,
but lacks functional p53. Perifosine, at concentrations below
IC50, dephosphorylated Akt and increased TRAIL-R2 levels,
as shown by Western blot, reverse transcription-PCR, and flow
cytometric analysis. Perifosine also decreased the long isoform of cFLIP (cFLIP-L) and the X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression. Perifosine and TRAIL
synergized to activate caspase-8 and induce apoptosis, which
was blocked by a caspase-8–selective inhibitor. Up-regulation
of TRAIL-R2 expression was dependent on a protein kinase
CA/c-Jun-NH2-kinase 2/c-Jun signaling pathway activated by
perifosine through reactive oxygen species production. Perifosine also synergized with TRAIL in primary AML cells
displaying constitutive activation of the Akt pathway by
inducing apoptosis, Akt dephosphorylation, TRAIL-R2 upregulation, cFLIP-L and XIAP down-regulation, and c-Jun
phosphorylation. The combined treatment negatively affected
the clonogenic activity of CD34+ cells from patients with AML.
In contrast, CD34+ cells from healthy donors were resistant to
perifosine and TRAIL treatment. Our findings suggest that the
combination of perifosine and TRAIL might offer a novel
therapeutic strategy for AML. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9394–403]

The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member, TNF-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), was originally reported to
induce apoptosis in many tumor cells but not in normal cells both
in vitro and in vivo and thus represents a promising anticancer
cytokine (1). TRAIL is expressed as a type II TNF trans-membrane
protein, however, its extracellular domain can be proteolytically
cleaved from the cell surface and acts as a soluble cytokine.
TRAIL transmits the death signal via TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 (also
referred to as DR4 and DR5, respectively) receptors, which, upon
TRAIL binding, are oligomerized at the cell surface, thereby
enabling the recruitment of the adaptor molecule Fas-associated
death domain (FADD) and assembly of the death-inducing
signaling complex (2). Two other TRAIL receptors, TRAIL-R3 and
TRAIL-R4 (also referred to as DcR1 and DcR2) contain no or only a
truncated death domain and do not induce apoptosis upon TRAIL
binding. TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4, therefore, act as decoy receptors
(3). It has been suggested that preferential expression of decoy
receptors on normal cells is one of the mechanisms underlying the
proapoptotic action of TRAIL in neoplastic cells but not in healthy
cells (4). Upon binding of TRAIL to R1 and R2 receptors, the
extrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated (3). In recent years, TRAIL
has stimulated hope for its therapeutic potential as an antineoplastic agent in different types of tumors, including hematologic
malignancies such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; ref. 5).
The in vitro cytotoxic response of AML cell lines to recombinant
TRAIL varies from good to moderate (6, 7); however, a number of
in vitro studies have convincingly shown that AML primary cells
are resistant to the proapoptotic activity of TRAIL used as a single
agent (e.g., ref. 8). TRAIL sensitivity of AML blasts could be
increased by cotreatment with cytotoxic drugs such as daunorubicin (9) or histone deacetylase inhibitors (10). A recent report has
highlighted that TRAIL sensitivity of human lung cancer cell lines
could be considerably increased by cotreatment with the novel Akt
inhibitor, perifosine (11). The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/
Akt signaling pathway is activated in many patients with AML
(12–14), and markedly influences AML sensitivity to various drugs,
including TRAIL (6). Therefore, small molecules which inhibit this
pathway are currently being developed for clinical use, one such
inhibitor is perifosine (15). Perifosine is a phospholipid analogue
which has shown promising preclinical activity and is also
currently undergoing phase I/II clinical evaluation for AML
treatment. Serum concentrations of up to 20 Amol/L of perifosine

TRAIL/Perifosine Combination Therapy in AML

have been reached during clinical evaluation (16, 17). We have
recently shown the cytotoxic activity of perifosine, alone or in
combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, in AML cells (18).
Therefore, it was investigated whether perifosine could increase
AML cell sensitivity to recombinant TRAIL. Here, we show in
THP-1 AML cells that perifosine increased TRAIL-R2 expression
and decreased levels of the long isoform of the cellular FLICEinhibitory protein (cFLIP-L) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
protein (XIAP) at concentrations below the IC50. When perifosine
was combined with TRAIL, there was a synergistic induction of
apoptosis and increased levels of caspase-8 activation. Similar
results were obtained using AML blasts with a constitutively active
PI3K/Akt pathway. Perifosine and TRAIL combined treatment also
decreased the clonogenic activity of CD34+ cells from patients with
AML with active Akt, whereas it had no effect on CD34+ cells from
healthy donors. Therefore, our findings suggest that perifosine, in
combination with TRAIL, may represent an effective approach for
the treatment of patients with AML.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and antibodies. Perifosine was provided by AEterna
Zentaris GmbH. For cell viability determination, Cell Viability kit I
3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was
purchased from Roche Applied Science. Propidium iodide (PI; DNA-Prep
kit) was from Beckman Coulter Immunology. The Annexin V-FITC staining
kit was from Tau Technologies BV, whereas carboxyfluorescein fluorescentlabeled inhibitor of caspases (FLICA) apoptosis detection kit for caspase
activity assay was from AbD Serotec. Recombinant human TRAIL, the c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125, and the p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580, were from EMD
Biosciences. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Gö6976, phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger
N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), and dichlorodihydrofuorescein diacetate were
from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies to the following proteins were used for
Western blot analysis: Akt, Ser473 p-Akt, XIAP, FADD, PKCa, caspase-8,
Ser638/641 p-PKCa/h, c-Jun, Ser63 p-c-Jun, Thr183/Tyr185 p-JNK 1/2, and
h-tubulin were from Cell Signaling; PKCh2 was from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; TRAIL receptors R1, R2, R3, R4, and cFLIP-S/L (which
recognizes both the short and the long isoforms of the protein) were from
ProSci, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse
secondary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. For
flow cytometric analysis, AlexaFluor 488–conjugated anti-Ser473 p-Akt was
from Cell Signaling; mouse anti-human TRAIL receptor antibodies conjugated to phycoerythrin were from R&D Systems; mouse anti-human CD33 FITCconjugated antibody was from BD Biosciences PharMingen. Controls were
performed with normal rabbit IgG conjugated to AlexaFluor 488 or normal
mouse IgG conjugated to either phycoerythrin or FITC (Upstate).
Cell culture, patients, and clonogenic assays. THP-1 human acute
monocytic leukemia cells were grown as previously reported (18). Samples
were obtained from patients upon presentation of AML, before chemotherapy treatment. Informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to
obtaining the samples, according to institutional guidelines. Bone marrow or
peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation. The percentage of blasts
in the samples ranged between 75% and 91% and was checked by flow
cytometry staining, depending on the phenotype of the leukemia (usually
CD13, CD33, CD34, CD45, alone or in combination). Blast cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% FCS. CD34+ progenitor cells from
patients with AML or from cord blood were isolated using immunomagnetic
cell separation (Miltenyi Biotec) and cultured as reported previously (14).
Cell viability analysis by MTT assay. An MTT assay was used to analyze
cell growth and viability, as reported elsewhere (19).
Flow cytometric detection of apoptosis and ROS generation. This
was performed as previously reported (18, 20).

Whole cell lysate preparation, cell fractionation, Western blot, and
densitometric analysis of blots. This was performed as previously
described (14). For analysis of THP-1 cells, 40 Ag of protein per lane was
loaded, whereas for AML blasts, 80 Ag of protein per lane was loaded.
Densitometric analysis was as reported by Nyakern and colleagues (21). For
each blot, the band with the highest intensity was normalized to 1, whereas
other bands were expressed as a fraction. Values from densitometric
scanning are indicated above each protein band. All the blots shown are
representative of at least three separate experiments.
Immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in 50 mmol/L of Tris (pH 8.0),
50 mmol/L of KCl, 10 mmol/L of EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor
cocktail, and 2 mmol/L of Na3VO4. Immunoprecipitation was performed
overnight using polyclonal antibodies to either PKCa or h2, according to
standard procedures. Antibodies were captured using protein A/G-agarose
and immunoprecipitates washed with lysis buffer.
Caspase activity assay. Flow cytometric assays were performed to
determine caspase activity, using the FLICA Apoptosis Detection kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as reported elsewhere (18).
Flow cytometric detection of Ser473 p-Akt, TRAIL receptors, and
CD33. P-Akt detection was performed essentially as previously reported
(13). Anti-TRAIL, TRAIL receptors, and CD33 antibodies ( final concentration, 10 Ag/mL) were used on fresh, unfixed cells (5  105) according to the
manufacturer’s procedure. Then, cells were washed thrice with PBS, fixed
with 0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, again washed thrice with PBS, and
immunostained for p-Akt. At least 5,000 events were analyzed for each
sample in all flow cytometric analyses. All the flow cytometric data are
representative of three different experiments.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis for TRAIL-RI and TRAIL-R2
mRNA. This was performed exactly according to Zhang and colleagues (22).
PCR-amplified products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel
containing 0.5 Ag/mL ethidium bromide and were visualized under UV
light.
Combined drug effects analysis. To characterize the interactions
between TRAIL and perifosine, the combination effect and a potential
synergy was evaluated from quantitative analysis of dose-effect relationships described by Chou and Talalay (23). CalcuSyn software (Biosoft) was
used to calculate combination indices (CI).
Transient protein down-regulation by short interfering RNA.
Scrambled (sc-44230) and specific short interfering RNAs (siRNA) to either
PKCa (sc-36243) or c-Jun (sc-29223) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Transfection of THP-1 cells was performed using the Amaxa system
(Amaxa) following their specifications (24). Briefly, 106 cells in 100 AL of
medium was mixed with 3 Ag of siRNA and transferred to an Amaxacertified cuvette. For transfection, we used the program V-01. Transfection
efficiency was between 75% and 85% (data not shown), as checked by
flow cytometry, using a fluorescein-labeled nontargeted siRNA control
(Cell Signaling). Cells were examined for gene down-regulation and other
properties 48 h after transfection.
Statistical evaluation. The data are presented as mean values from
three separate experiments F SD. Data were statistically analyzed by a
Dunnet test after one-way ANOVA at a level of significance of P < 0.05
versus control samples.

Results
Effect of TRAIL and perifosine on THP-1 cell survival.
Exposure for 24 hours to increasing concentrations of recombinant
TRAIL or perifosine induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell
survival, as evaluated by MTT assays (Fig. 1A). At the highest tested
concentration of TRAIL (800 ng/mL) or perifosine (16 Amol/L),
survival was 60% or 32%, respectively. To establish whether a
combined treatment consisting of TRAIL and perifosine was
synergistic, THP-1 cells were cultured with serial concentrations of
TRAIL (range, 12.5–800 ng/mL) and perifosine (range, 0.25–
16.0 Amol/L) at a constant ratio for 24 hours and data were
analyzed by the method of Chou and Talalay (23). The combined

treatment was much more cytotoxic than either of the single
treatments. All the combinations gave an effect which ranged from
synergistic (CI < 0.6) to highly synergistic (CI < 0.3; Fig. 1B). To
determine whether decreased cell survival was related to apoptosis,
an Annexin V-FITC/PI analysis was performed. When samples were
analyzed by flow cytometry, it became evident that the combined
TRAIL and perifosine treatment induced apoptotic cell death of
THP-1 cells, whereas when the single drugs were used alone, much
lower effects were observed (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis showed
a marked decrease in Ser473 p-Akt phosphorylation at 0.5 Amol/L of
perifosine. Akt dephosphorylation was complete at 1.0 Amol/L,
whereas total Akt levels remained unchanged (Fig. 1D).
Perifosine increases TRAIL-R2 expression in THP-1 cells and
down-regulates cFLIP-L and XIAP levels. Given that perifosine
up-regulates TRAIL-R2 expression in human lung carcinoma
cells (11), we investigated if this was also true for THP-1 cells.
The expression of TRAIL receptors in untreated THP-1 cells
was examined by flow cytometry. Under basal conditions, it was
observed that these cells expressed TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and
TRAIL-R4, but no TRAIL-R3 (data not shown), in agreement with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

others (25). Western blot analysis showed that perifosine increased
the levels of TRAIL-R2 in a dose-dependent manner. The amount of
the other TRAIL receptors expressed by THP-1 cells was almost
unchanged (Fig. 2A). A dose-dependent decrease in c-FLIP-L and
XIAP expression was also observed in THP-1 cells treated with
perifosine, whereas FADD levels were not affected. Increased
expression of TRAIL-R2 protein by Western blot was corroborated
by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, which showed an
increase in TRAIL-R2, but not in TRAIL-R1, mRNA (Fig. 2A). Also,
flow cytometric analysis highlighted selective enhanced TRAIL-R2
expression in response to perifosine treatment (Fig. 2B). Moreover,
this technique showed no changes in surface TRAIL expression by
perifosine (data not shown).
Perifosine and TRAIL combined treatment results in
enhanced caspase-8 activation. The combined treatment was
associated with increased activation of caspase-8, as shown by
FLICA assay (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis corroborated flow
cytometric findings, demonstrating a dramatic decrease in
procaspase-8 levels and the appearance of the p18 cleaved
fragment of caspase-8 in cells treated with perifosine and TRAIL

combination (Fig. 2C). In contrast, no p18 fragment was detected in
cells treated with TRAIL alone, whereas a very faint band was
visible in samples exposed to perifosine alone. The relevance of
caspase-8 activation for perifosine-induced apoptosis was shown

by experiments in which cells were preincubated with a selective
caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) prior to being treated with the
combined drugs. This resulted in a much lower percentage of
apoptotic cells (Fig. 2D).

Up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 requires PKC activity. A recent
report has highlighted that TRAIL-R2 up-regulation in non–small
cell lung cancer cells required PKC activity (26). Therefore, we
investigated whether this was true also in THP-1 cells. Preliminary
experiments indicated that THP-1 cells expressed only two of
the conventional PKC isoforms, a and h2, whereas h1 and g were
not expressed (data not shown). When cells were treated with
perifosine and Gö6976, a well-established inhibitor of PKC
conventional isoforms (27), the increase in TRAIL-R2 expression
was lower. No changes in the expression of other TRAIL receptors
(R1 and R4) were observed in response to Gö6976 and perifosine
treatment, whereas cFLIP-L and XIAP levels did not significantly
change in cells treated with Gö6976 and perifosine when compared
with perifosine alone (Fig. 3A). A time-dependent increase in
TRAIL-R2, but not TRAIL-R1, expression levels was detected when
THP-1 cells were treated with PMA, an activator of PKC
conventional isoforms (ref. 28; Fig. 3B). Down-regulation of PKCa
levels by specific siRNA, but not treatment with scrambled siRNA,
resulted in a much lower induction of TRAIL-R2 by perifosine
(Fig. 3C). MTT assays showed a lower cytotoxic effect of the

perifosine and TRAIL combined treatment in cells with downregulated PKCa expression, but not in those treated with
scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3D). The efficacy of PKCa down-regulation
by specific siRNA was evaluated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3D).
Overall, these findings indicated that up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by
perifosine was dependent on PKCa and was required to maximally
potentiate the proapoptotic effect of TRAIL.
Up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by perifosine is dependent on a
ROS/PKCA/JNK 2/c-Jun pathway. The mechanism of PKCa
activation by perifosine was next investigated. It has been shown
that PKCa could be activated (phosphorylated) by ROS (29, 30),
which also induced its membrane binding. Moreover, perifosine
caused ROS production in U937 AML cells (31). Therefore, it was
investigated if perifosine also caused ROS production in THP-1
cells. ROS generation was analyzed by flow cytometry after labeling
of cells with the ROS-selective probe, DCFH-DA. Perifosine
(2 Amol/L) caused an increase in ROS levels, which was blocked
by the ROS scavenger, NAC (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Cell
fractionation experiments showed that in response to perifosine
treatment, the amount of membrane-bound PKCa increased,

whereas cytosolic PKCa decreased (Fig. 4A). These changes in
PKCa subcellular localization were largely prevented by NAC,
suggesting that they were dependent on ROS production. Moreover,
perifosine treatment resulted in increased Thr638/641 p-PKCa levels
but not in PKCh2 isoforms, as shown by immunoprecipitation
experiments with antibodies selective for total (unphosphorylated
and phosphorylated) PKCa and PKCh2 isoforms, followed by
Western blotting with an antibody which recognizes both PKCa
and PKCh1/2 phosphorylated on Thr638/641 (Fig. 4A).
Flow cytometric analysis also showed that the perifosineinduced increase in TRAIL-R2 expression was markedly reduced
if cells were treated with NAC in addition to perifosine, whereas
RT-PCR documented that NAC was indeed capable of almost

www.aacrjournals.org

completely blocking the perifosine-dependent increase in TRAILR2 mRNA levels. However, NAC did not affect the perifosine-evoked
decrease in cFLIP-L levels (Fig. 4B). Recent findings have
highlighted that TRAIL-R2 gene expression could be under the
control of a JNK/c-Jun pathway (32), and that in some cell models,
PKCa could be upstream of JNK (33, 34). Perifosine (2 Amol/L) upregulated p-JNK 2 (54 kDa) but not p-JNK 1 (46 kDa) in THP-1 cells,
and this event could be blocked by NAC (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Perifosine treatment resulted in c-Jun phosphorylation on Ser63,
and this phosphorylation was inhibited by SP600125 (a JNK 1/2–
selective inhibitor) but not by SB203580 (a p38 MAPK–selective
inhibitor). Moreover, SP600125, but not SB203580, suppressed the
perifosine-dependent increase in TRAIL-R2 expression (Fig. 4C).

Finally, when c-Jun levels were down-regulated by siRNA specific
for c-Jun (Supplementary Fig. S1C), the perifosine-evoked increase
in TRAIL-R2 expression was reduced significantly (Fig. 4D). Taken
together, these findings strongly suggested that perifosine could
up-regulate TRAIL-R2 expression through a ROS ! PKCa ! JNK 2
! c-Jun signaling pathway.
Synergistic cytotoxic effects of TRAIL/perifosine combined
treatment on AML blasts with activated Akt. The efficacy of
the perifosine and TRAIL combined treatment was then analyzed
on samples obtained from patients with AML. Samples from 12
patients were studied (Table 1). Because levels of caspase-8 could
influence the TRAIL sensitivity of AML blasts (35), we analyzed
samples with comparable expression of caspase-8, as evaluated by
Western blot analysis (data not shown). Activation of PI3K/Akt
signaling was studied by Western blot and/or flow cytometric
analysis. Seven patients were positive for Ser473 p-Akt (Table 1).
The combination of perifosine and TRAIL was much more effective
than either drug alone, as shown by MTT assays (Fig. 5A,
patient M4#1). Cytotoxicity was due to apoptotic cell death, as
documented by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining (Fig. 5B), and was
characterized by increased TRAIL-R2 expression which was
detected in CD33+ AML cells by flow cytometric analysis of
samples double-stained for TRAIL-R2 and CD33 (Fig. 5C).
Combined treatment also resulted in higher levels of caspase8 activation compared with single treatment, as shown by FLICA
analysis (data not shown). Western blot analysis showed Ser473
p-Akt down-regulation by perifosine, in patient blasts with Akt
activation, as well as a decrease of both cFLIP-L and XIAP, and upregulation of Ser63 p-c-Jun (Fig. 5D). FADD levels were not affected
by perifosine. In contrast, in patients with no activated Akt, we did
not detect increased apoptosis in response to the combined
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2A, patient M4#2). In samples
from these patients, there was neither increased TRAIL-R2
expression nor decreased cFLIP-L and XIAP expression. Moreover,

c-Jun phosphorylation on Ser63 was not increased after treatment
with perifosine (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). FADD levels did
not change in a significant manner. In Table 1, we summarize the
results obtained by treating AML samples, showing the effects of
perifosine on TRAIL-R2 expression and the average CI of the
combined treatment.
Perifosine/TRAIL combined treatment negatively affects
clonogenic activity of CD34+ cells from patients with AML.
Finally, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of perifosine/TRAIL
combined treatment on CD34+ cell clonogenic activity from cord
blood and from patients with AML. As expected, neither TRAIL nor
perifosine alone influenced the clonogenic activity of CD34+ cells
from healthy donors, and the same was true of the combined
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2D). In contrast, in leukemic
CD34+ cells, TRAIL moderately affected clonogenic activity and
perifosine alone exhibited a statistically significant inhibitory effect
in some samples (see for example, patient M2#7). However, in all
patient samples with activated Akt, we consistently observed a
strong inhibitory effect of the perifosine and TRAIL combined
treatment on the CD34+ cell clonogenic activity.

Discussion
In this study, we showed that perifosine sensitizes AML cells
from both the THP-1 cell line and patients, to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, at least in part via a decrease in cFLIP-L and XIAP levels,
and through a PKCa-mediated increase in TRAIL-R2 expression.
cFLIP-L, which is structurally similar to caspase-8, can be recruited
to the death-inducing signaling complex to inhibit the binding and
activation of caspase-8 and acts as a powerful repressor of TRAILinduced death signaling (3). Also XIAP, a potent cellular caspase
inhibitor, is an important factor in TRAIL-induced cell death (36).
A recent report from Carter and colleagues (36) has shown that
triptolide, an anticancer agent from a Chinese herb, sensitized AML
cells to TRAIL by decreasing XIAP levels and increasing TRAIL-R2
expression through a p53-mediated mechanism. However, perifosine was able to up-regulate TRAIL-R2 in THP-1 cells which have
a nonfunctional p53 (37). It has been established that TRAIL-R2
levels could be regulated through mechanisms which are p53dependent or -independent (38). Among p53-independent mechanisms, it has been shown that the JNK/c-Jun axis could positively
regulate TRAIL-R2 transcription (32). A functional activator
protein-1 (AP-1) binding site has been shown in the promoter
region of TRAIL-R2. JNK, by increasing c-Jun phosphorylation,
leads to an increase in AP-1 activity (39). Interestingly, we have
recently shown JNK-dependent increased AP-1 activity in
T-lymphoblastic acute leukemia cells treated with perifosine (19).
Our findings point to PKCa as an important mediator of TRAILR2 up-regulation in THP-1 cells, as PKCa down-regulation by
siRNA resulted in a much lower induction of TRAIL-R2 and a
decrease in perifosine-dependent sensitization to TRAIL cytotoxic
effect, whereas PMA, a conventional PKC isoform activator,
increased TRAIL-R2 expression. Perifosine increased ROS production in THP-1 cells, and ROS could promote PKCa binding to the
plasma membrane. Perifosine also induced increased levels of
phosphorylation of JNK 2 (but not JNK 1) and c-Jun in THP-1 cells.
NAC impaired the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by perifosine. The
involvement of JNK 2/c-Jun signaling in the increased expression of
TRAIL-R2 was shown by the fact that a JNK 1/2–selective inhibitor,
but not a p38 MAPK inhibitor, blocked both c-Jun phosphorylation
on Ser63 induced by perifosine and TRAIL-R2 up-regulation.

TRAIL/Perifosine Combination Therapy in AML

Figure 5. Perifosine and TRAIL combination is synergistic in AML
primary cells with activated Akt. A, cells from patient M4#1 were
treated for 48 h with either single agent alone or in combination at the
indicated concentrations. Cell viability was analyzed by MTT assays.

C, flow cytometric analysis showing surface expression of TRAIL
receptors and CD33 in cells from patient M4#1, either untreated or
treated with 4.0 Amol/L of perifosine for 24 h. Anti-TRAIL receptor
antibodies were conjugated to phycoerythrin, whereas anti-CD33
antibody was FITC-conjugated. D, Western blot analysis for
Ser473 p-Akt, cFLIP-L, XIAP, FADD, and Ser63 p-c-Jun in extracts
from AML patient primary cells. Perifosine treatment was for 24 h
at 4.0 Amol/L concentration. h-Tubulin served as loading control.

Furthermore, down-regulation of c-Jun by siRNA also opposed the
increase in TRAIL-R2. Given that in cells with down-regulated
PKCa, perifosine was unable to increase JNK 2 phosphorylation, we
propose a mechanism whereby perifosine generates ROS, which in

www.aacrjournals.org

turn, activates a PKCa ! JNK 2 ! c-Jun signaling pathway which
leads to increased expression of TRAIL-R2.
XIAP and c-FLIP-L down-regulation caused by perifosine in THP1 cells, could be due to an inhibition of the nuclear factor nB activity,

which is under the control of the PI3K/Akt axis in AML cells (12). A
recent investigation carried out on Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells has indeed shown that perifosine targets nuclear factor nB
(40). Future studies should address the mechanism(s) which
underlie XIAP and cFLIP-L down-regulation by perifosine in AML
cells. Nevertheless, our unpublished findings, obtained by siRNA
technology, have indicated that down-regulation of these two
proteins was not as critical as that of PKCa for the potentiating
effect of perifosine on TRAIL cytotoxicity on THP-1 cells.
Our results showed that a perifosine and TRAIL combination
was also much more effective than either treatment alone in
primary AML cells. Even though the analysis we performed was not
as comprehensive as the one we did in THP-1 cells, due to the
insufficient amount of cells recovered from most of the patients,
perifosine dephosphorylated Akt, down-regulated XIAP and cFLIPL expression, and up-regulated the levels of TRAIL-R2 and Ser63
p-c-Jun in some primary AML cells. AML blasts died by apoptosis
and the combined treatment was much more effective in activating
caspase-8 than either treatment alone. All the patient samples
expressed TRAIL-R2 to some extent (data not shown); however,
perifosine increased TRAIL-R2 expression only in samples with
activated PI3K/Akt signaling. Accordingly, synergism was only
observed in those AML samples which displayed activated Akt. The
fact that despite the expression of TRAIL-R2 even under basal
conditions, AML blasts were not sensitive to TRAIL alone, could be
explained by the contemporaneous expression of TRAIL decoy
receptors (8). After perifosine treatment, TRAIL-R2 was markedly
up-regulated in AML blasts, and most likely this could overcome
the antiapoptotic effect played by high levels of decoy receptors.
However, it should not be ruled out that other proteins, which are
critically important for TRAIL sensitivity (35, 41), are downregulated by perifosine in AML primary cells.
At present, it is unclear why perifosine increased ROS generation
only in primary AML cells with up-regulated PI3K/Akt signaling.
Nevertheless, a recent report has highlighted that 7-ketochetosterol, which is incorporated into the lipid rafts of THP-1 cells (42),
was able to increase ROS production by up-regulating the levels of
NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX-4) in THP-1 cells. Interestingly, this was
accompanied by a down-regulation of Akt (43). It might be that
perifosine, by disrupting PI3K/Akt signaling at the lipid rafts,
positively affects NOX-4 gene expression. Therefore, it would be
interesting to investigate if NOX-4 gene expression is under the
control of the PI3K/Akt axis in AML cells.

Our results point to the fact that a combination consisting of
TRAIL and perifosine had no effect on the clonogenic activity of
CD34+ cells from healthy donors, whereas it was markedly
cytotoxic for CD34+ cells isolated from leukemic patients. Previous
results have shown that TRAIL was not cytotoxic for normal CD34+
cells (44, 45), reflecting the lack of TRAIL receptors expressed in
these cells (46). In contrast, TRAIL displayed proapoptotic activity
in CD34+ cells from patients with AML (45), and we have confirmed
these findings. Therefore, CD34+ AML cells express TRAIL
receptors. Future investigations should be aimed towards investigating whether leukemic stem cells also express TRAIL receptors
and whether they could be targeted by the combination of TRAIL
and perifosine.
In conclusion, we have shown the in vitro efficacy of a TRAIL
and perifosine combination treatment in AML cells. This
combination was also synergistic in cells (THP-1) lacking
functional p53. Even if p53 deletion and/or inactivating mutations
are observed in only f10% of patients with AML, p53 levels are
frequently low in AML blasts due to overexpression of the negative
regulator murine double minute (MDM2; ref. 47). Thus, the use of a
drug which could up-regulate TRAIL-R2 levels independently of
p53 could be extremely useful in leukemia therapy. Accordingly, it
must be emphasized that the cytotoxic effect of triptolide and
TRAIL combination was enhanced by the addition of the MDM2
antagonist, Nutlin-3a (36). In case of triptolide, another drug was
required to maximize the effects of TRAIL, which could result in
additional toxic side effects if administered to patients.
In summary, the combination of perifosine and TRAIL could
represent a novel strategy for treating patients with AML by
overcoming critical mechanisms of apoptosis resistance.
