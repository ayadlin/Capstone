Abstract
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common
adult sarcomas and the oncogenic driver is usually a KIT or
PDGFRA mutation. Although GISTs are often initially sensitive
to imatinib or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, resistance generally develops, necessitating backup strategies for therapy. In
this study, we determined that a subset of human GIST specimens that acquired imatinib resistance acquired expression of
activated forms of the MET oncogene. MET activation also
developed after imatinib therapy in a mouse model of GIST
(KitV558del/þ mice), where it was associated with increased
tumor hypoxia. MET activation also occurred in imatinib-sensitive human GIST cell lines after imatinib treatment in vitro. MET

inhibition by crizotinib or RNA interference was cytotoxic to an
imatinib-resistant human GIST cell population. Moreover, combining crizotinib and imatinib was more effective than imatinib
alone in imatinib-sensitive GIST models. Finally, cabozantinib, a
dual MET and KIT small-molecule inhibitor, was markedly more
effective than imatinib in multiple preclinical models of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST. Collectively, our ﬁndings showed that activation of compensatory MET signaling by
KIT inhibition may contribute to tumor resistance. Furthermore,
our work offered a preclinical proof of concept for MET inhibition by cabozantinib as an effective strategy for GIST treatment.

Introduction

revolutionized GIST treatment (2). Up to 80% of patients with
metastatic GIST treated with imatinib achieve a partial response or
stable disease (8). However, imatinib is rarely curative, and
tumors initially sensitive to imatinib acquire resistance within
2 years (9, 10). A secondary KIT mutation accounts for approximately half of all cases of acquired imatinib resistance (11).
Alternatively, KIT ampliﬁcation and overexpression has been
detected in a small fraction of imatinib-resistant tumors (12).
The upregulation of additional RTKs has been shown to occur in
vitro in human GIST cell lines cultured in imatinib until resistance
develops. Inhibiting these upregulated RTKs was cytotoxic, indicating that kinase switching may confer imatinib resistance (13,
14). Kinase switching has not been demonstrated in vivo. After
imatinib failure, few therapeutic options remain. Sunitinib
(Sutent; Pﬁzer) and regorafenib (Stivarga; Bayer) are multikinase
inhibitors that provide temporary beneﬁt to patients with imatinib-resistant tumors, with a median time to progression of 4.8 to
6.8 months (15, 16). Thus, there is an urgent need to identify other
components of resistance and novel therapies for GIST.
The RTK MET is the product of the MET proto-oncogene and is
vital to embryogenesis and wound healing, and is also implicated
in tumorigenesis, tumor angiogenesis, and metastasis (17). MET
overexpression has been found in multiple cancers, including
gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma, and mutations of
MET occur in renal, lung, ovarian, and colorectal cancer (18).
Activation of MET has also been shown to confer drug resistance in
non–small cell lung (NSCLC), breast, and colorectal cancer (19–
21). Hypoxia increases MET gene transcription via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 a (HIF-1a) binding to the MET promoter and
increases MET receptor activation by sensitizing the receptor to
ligand stimulation (22). Ligation of MET by hepatocyte growth

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common
sarcoma and arises throughout the gastrointestinal tract (1, 2). Up
to 80% of GISTs contain an activating mutation in the KIT protooncogene, which encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) KIT
(3). Approximately 5% to 10% of GISTs instead harbor an
activating mutation of the PDGRA proto-oncogene, which
encodes platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRa;
ref. 4). An additional 5% to 10% of GISTs do not contain a
mutation in either KIT or PDGFRA, and some of these are deﬁcient
in succinate dehydrogenase enzymes (5).
Surgical resection is the primary treatment for localized, primary GIST. Historically, up to 50% of patients developed tumor
recurrence after initial resection, most commonly in the liver or on
the peritoneal surface, and median survival after recurrence was
less than 2 years (6). Unfortunately, GISTs respond poorly to
conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy (7). Targeted therapy of the KIT and PDGFRa RTKs with the smallmolecule inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis) has

factor (HGF) activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT), and Src
signal transduction pathways (17), all of which are also downstream of KIT.
Although half of imatinib-resistant tumors contain a secondary
KIT mutation, additional mechanisms of imatinib resistance
require further elucidation. In this study, we sought to determine
whether additional RTKs become activated in vivo in GIST. Using a
phospho-RTK array, we discovered that MET was activated in an
imatinib-resistant human GIST cell line and veriﬁed this in
multiple advanced human GIST specimens. In addition, we found
that imatinib increased the expression of activated MET in imatinib-sensitive human GIST cell lines and in a genetically engineered mouse model of GIST. We determined that the imatinibresistant cell line depended on MET for survival, and targeting
MET with the small-molecule inhibitor crizotinib (Xalkori; Pﬁzer;
ref. 23) or speciﬁc MET knockdown with siRNA was cytotoxic. We
also showed that the dual KIT/MET inhibitor cabozantinib
(Cometriq; Exelixis; ref. 24) or the combination of imatinib and
crizotinib was more effective than imatinib alone in multiple
preclinical models of GIST. Taken together, our ﬁndings indicated
that MET activation occurs in GIST and upregulation of MET may
contribute to imatinib-resistance in vivo. Furthermore, targeting of
MET is a promising strategy for the treatment of both imatinibsensitive and -resistant GIST.

Materials and Methods
Mice and treatments
Age and sex-matched KitV558del/þ (25), NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG), and C57BL/6J (B6) mice (The Jackson
Laboratory) were used. All procedures and treatments were
approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
For xenograft experiments, 106 GIST-T1, HG129, or HG209 cells
in PBS were mixed 1:1 with BD Matrigel Matrix Growth Factor
Reduced (BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously into the
right ﬂank of NSG mice. Xenograft tumors were measured using
the modiﬁed ellipsoid formula (1/2  length  width  height),
and treatment was initiated when mean tumor volume reached
approximately 100 mm3. Imatinib, sunitinib, and crizotinib were
purchased from LC Laboratories. Imatinib (600 mg/L in drinking
water), sunitinib (53.6 mg/kg daily gavage), crizotinib (50 mg/kg
daily gavage), and cabozantinib (60 mg/kg daily gavage, ChemieTek) were administered. Control mice received regular drinking water and gavage vehicle.
Cell lines, cell viability and signaling assays, and phospho-RTK
array
GIST882, GIST-T1, and HG129 cell lines have been described
previously (26–28). The HG209 human GIST cell line was
established under an IRB-approved protocol. HG209 was
derived from an imatinib- and sunitinib-resistant peritoneal
metastasis, which contained a KIT exon 11 deletion (Y570L576) and a KIT exon 17 point mutation (c.2446 C>G p.
D816H). Expression of KIT and ETV1 was conﬁrmed in all cell
lines by Western blot analysis, and KIT mutations were conﬁrmed by sequencing. Cells were cultured in complete medium
containing RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin, and 10 mmol/L
HEPES. To measure viability, 2  104 GIST882 cells or 104

2062 Cancer Res; 75(10) May 15, 2015

GIST-T1, HG129, or HG209 cells were seeded in replicates of
ﬁve in a 96-well ﬂat-bottomed plate (Falcon) and cultured
for 72 hours with imatinib, crizotinib, cabozantinib, HGF
100 ng/mL, or H2O- or DMSO-only solvent control. Viability
was measured using a colorimetric tetrazolium salt assay (Cell
Counting Kit-8, Dojindo Molecular Technologies) per the
manufacturer's instructions, and all values were normalized to
control. Drug IC50 values were determined using nonlinear
regression in Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software). For protein
analysis, 4  106 cells were seeded in a 100  20 mm cell
culture dish (Falcon) in serum-free media. Cells were treated
with imatinib or H2O or DMSO-only solvent. For the human
phospho-RTK array, GIST882, HG129, and HG209 cells were
serum-starved for 3 hours, cell lysates were collected, and 250
mg of protein were analyzed using the Human Phospho-Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Array Kit (R&D Systems). Using ImageJ
(NIH), pixel density of all positive signals was measured and
background signal was subtracted. Pixel density mean  SEM of
duplicate signals is reported.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from KitV558del/þ mouse bulk tumor or
human GIST cells, reverse transcribed, and ampliﬁed with PCR
TaqMan probes for mouse Met (Mm01156972_ml), mouse Hif1a
(Mm00468869_ml), human MET (Hs01565584_ml), and
GAPDH (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed
using a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Data
were calculated by the 2DDCt method as described by the manufacturer's protocol and were expressed as the fold increase over
the indicated controls.
MET knockdown
For transient MET knockdown, GIST882, GIST-T1, and
HG209 cells were transfected with 30 nmol/L of ON-TARGET
plus SMARTpool siRNA speciﬁc for human MET (L-003156-00)
or a non-target control siRNA (D-001810-01-05; Thermo Scientiﬁc) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for 48 or
96 hours. GIST882 cells were then treated with H2O control or
imatinib for 48 hours. Cell viability was measured and normalized to vehicle-treated, non-target control siRNA-transfected cells.
Human specimens and Western blot analysis
Protein from snap-frozen GIST tissue or cell lines was analyzed
as before (29). Tumor chunks from surgical specimens were
obtained from 36 patients with GIST who consented to tissue
analysis under an Institutional Review Board protocol. Antibodies
were used against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), total MET (25H2) total, and phosphorylated KIT
(Tyr719), AKT (Ser473), STAT3 (Ser727), ERK1/2 (Thr202/
Tyr204), Src (Tyr416), Gab1 (Tyr307, all Cell Signaling Technology), and pMET (Tyr1230/1234/1235; Life Technologies).
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometric analysis was performed on KitV558del/þmouse
tumors as before (28). All cells were analyzed on a FACSAria (BD
Biosciences). Mouse-speciﬁc antibodies included CD45 (clone
30-F11) and Met (eBioclone 7) from eBioscience, and Kit
(CD117; 2B8), Rat IgG2ak isotype (R35-95), and rat IgG1k
isotype (R3-34) from BD Biosciences.

HGF measurement
KitV558del/þ mouse serum, tumor, and liver and B6 mouse serum
HGF concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Quantikine ELISA Mouse/Rat
HGF kit (R&D Systems).
Histology
Tumors were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in
parafﬁn, and cut into 5-mm sections. Immunostaining for KIT
(Cell Signaling Technology #3074; 1:200), Ki67 (Vector Laboratories #VP-K451; 1:1,000), and CD31 (Abcam #ab28364; 1:50)
was performed as before (29). Intratumoral hypoxia was detected
by i.p. injection of pimonidazole (60 mg/kg, Hypoxyprobe-1) 1
hour prior to sacriﬁce of KitV558del/þ mice. Pimonidazole was
detected with a Discovery XT processor (Ventana Medical Systems) using deparafﬁnized tissue sections after antigen retrieval
with CC1 buffer (Ventana) and blocking for 30 minutes with
Background Buster solution (Innovex). Anti-pimonidazole
mouse monoclonal antibody (Hypoxyprobe Inc.) was applied
at 0.12 mg/mL and sections were incubated for 5 hours, followed
by 1-hour incubation with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG
(Vector Labs; cat. no. MKB-22258) at 1:200 dilution, then streptavidin–HRP D (part of DABMap kit; Ventana), and followed by

Imaging wide-ﬁeld microscope (Zeiss).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software). An
unpaired two-tailed Student t test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey
correction for multiple comparisons post-test was performed as
applicable. Data were considered signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.

Results
MET is activated in a subset of human GISTs
We sought to identify additional RTKs that become activated in
imatinib-resistant GIST and may serve as targets for therapy. We
surveyed 49 phosphorylated tyrosine kinases by array in untreated
imatinib-sensitive human GIST cell lines GIST882 and HG129
and the HG209 cell line derived from a patient with an imatinibresistant tumor. HG209 had markedly lower expression of activated KIT and PDGFRa and higher expression of activated MET
and AXL (Fig. 1A). In addition, HG209 had a slight increase in
activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). There was no
expression of the other RTKs surveyed, including VEGFR2, Tie-2,
RET, ALK, and FGFR1-4. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that
MET mRNA was also elevated in the imatinib-resistant HG209 cell
line compared with imatinib-sensitive cells (GIST882, GIST-T1,

and HG129; Fig. 1B). By Western blot analysis, the HG209 cell
line had less activated and total KIT, but higher activated and total
MET compared with GIST882 cells (Fig. 1C).
To determine the frequency of activated MET expression in
human GISTs, we performed Western blot analysis on a panel
of surgical specimens. We found that MET was activated in
some untreated primary GISTs, an imatinib-sensitive tumor,
and several imatinib-resistant tumors (Fig. 1D), including the
original tumor from which the HG209 cell line was derived. Of
36 human GIST specimens we further examined, 20 (56%)
expressed activated MET: 4 of 12 untreated, 7 of 10 imatinibsensitive, and 9 of 14 imatinib-resistant tumors (data not
shown). MET activation was present in some gastric and nongastric GISTs and in some KIT exon 11 and PDGFRA-mutant
tumors (data not shown). We analyzed KIT signaling in six of
the imatinib-resistant specimens and found that in four of these
specimens, activated KIT expression was low and activated MET
expression was high, raising the possibility that these tumors
now depended on MET rather than KIT for survival (Fig. 1D). In
other cancers, MET can be activated by multiple mechanisms,
including overexpression, ampliﬁcation, or mutation (30).

2064 Cancer Res; 75(10) May 15, 2015

Using FISH analysis, we could not ﬁnd MET copy number
changes in the tumor specimens or derived cell line of HG209
(data not shown), even though it highly expressed MET mRNA
and activated MET. Sanger sequencing of MET DNA was performed and did not reveal any mutations in the HG209 cell line
(data not shown).
To conﬁrm that imatinib therapy induced MET activation, as
was seen in 70% of the imatinib-sensitive human specimens, we
treated the imatinib-sensitive human GIST cell lines GIST882,
GIST-T1, and HG129. MET was activated in each cell line (Fig. 1E).
Overall, then, MET is activated in some human GISTs at baseline
and during response or resistance to imatinib.
KIT inhibition induces MET activation in a GIST mouse model.
KitV558del/þ mice develop a single intestinal GIST that initially
responds to imatinib therapy and then is stable in size with
continued KIT activation and regrows after cessation of therapy
(28). We treated KitV558del/þ mice to ascertain whether MET
becomes activated in vivo after imatinib therapy. Indeed, Met
mRNA expression increased with prolonged imatinib therapy
(Fig. 2A). Although activated MET was not detectable with vehicle

MET in GIST

therapy, prolonged imatinib therapy increased activated MET
expression (Fig. 2B). Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2
(GRB2)-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1; ref. 31), a key
downstream docking protein of MET, was also phosphorylated
after imatinib therapy and coincided with activated MET, suggesting active MET signaling. To determine whether MET activation
was speciﬁc to imatinib therapy, we treated KitV558del/þ mice with
sunitinib and again found more activated MET (Fig. 2C). To
identify which cell populations expressed MET, we performed
ﬂow cytometric analysis of KitV558del/þ mouse tumors. We found
that MET was expressed on approximately half of the tumor cells
(CD45KITþ), with low expression on the stromal cells
(CD45KIT) and immune cells (CD45þ; Fig. 2D).
Ligand-dependent autocrine and paracrine activation of MET
has been described in osteosarcoma and glioblastoma tumor
models (32). To determine whether imatinib therapy activated
MET by increasing HGF production, we measured HGF concentration in KitV558del/þ tumors. The tumor concentration of HGF
was high at baseline (compared with liver), but not altered by
imatinib (Fig. 2E). Similarly, imatinib did not affect serum HGF
levels in KitV558del/þ mice, which were similar in untreated B6 mice
(data not shown).
Hypoxia is an established inducer of MET expression and
sensitizes the MET receptor to HGF stimulation (22). To determine whether KitV558del/þ tumors became hypoxic after imatinib
therapy, we performed quantitative RT-PCR for Hif1a. Imatinibtreated tumors had increased Hif1a mRNA expression compared
with vehicle-treated tumors (Fig. 2F). To conﬁrm our RT-PCR
ﬁndings, we injected KitV558del/þ mice with pimonidazole, which
accumulates in hypoxic tissue (33). KitV558del/þ tumors treated
with imatinib for 4 weeks demonstrated markedly increased
pimonidazole staining compared with vehicle-treated tumors
(Fig. 2G). Thus, we determined that KitV558del/þ mouse tumors
treated with imatinib become hypoxic, and Met mRNA is overexpressed and MET becomes activated.
MET inhibition enhances the effects of imatinib on human GIST
cell lines
To characterize further the role of MET expression in HG209
cells, we stimulated them with HGF. Unlike with GIST882 and
GIST-T1 cells, HGF had a potent mitogenic effect on the imatinibresistant HG209 cell line (Fig. 3A), suggesting that MET can be an
important prosurvival signal in GIST. Next, we targeted MET with
crizotinib, a small-molecule inhibitor with potent activity against
MET, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and ROS (ROS1;
ref. 34). Crizotinib was more effective than imatinib in inhibiting
cellular proliferation of HG209 cells (Fig. 3B). The importance of
MET to survival in HG209 was further conﬁrmed by selective
knockdown of MET, which signiﬁcantly decreased cell viability
(Fig. 3C, left). MET knockdown was conﬁrmed by Western blot
analysis, which demonstrated a reduction in the mature, 145-kDa
b subunit of MET (Fig. 3C, right). Taken together, the HG209
imatinib-resistant cell line had low levels of activated KIT but
highly expressed activated MET, and its viability was reduced by
MET inhibition.
To establish the importance of activated MET expression in
imatinib-sensitive cell lines, we stimulated GIST882 cells
with HGF. Just as HGF was mitogenic on HG209 cells (Fig.
3A), HGF was also mitogenic on imatinib-sensitive GIST882
cells after imatinib therapy (Fig. 3D), consistent with MET
upregulation. Thus, MET signaling can rescue cells from

www.aacrjournals.org

imatinib. Importantly, GIST882, GIST-T1, and HG129 cells
treated with imatinib or control for 24 hours did not produce
HGF as measured by ELISA of culture supernatant (data not
shown).
Because MET activation was able to rescue imatinib-sensitive cells from imatinib treatment, and MET inhibition was
effective in an imatinib-resistant cell line expressing high
levels of activated MET, we tested whether MET inhibition
with crizotinib could be cytotoxic in imatinib-sensitive GIST.
The addition of crizotinib to imatinib signiﬁcantly decreased
cell viability in the imatinib-sensitive cell lines (Fig. 3E). To
conﬁrm that the antitumor effect of crizotinib was mediated
speciﬁcally by MET inhibition, we performed selective knockdown of MET. Knockdown of MET sensitized GIST882 and
GIST-T1 cells to imatinib therapy (Fig. 3F, left), recapitulating
the effect of combined crizotinib and imatinib therapy. MET
knockdown was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3F,
right).
To translate these ﬁndings to an in vivo model, we treated NSG
mice bearing established HG129 human GIST xenografts with
crizotinib and imatinib. Crizotinib increased the effects of imatinib, resulting in smaller tumors compared with imatinib treatment alone (mean tumor volume, 368 vs. 775 mm3; P < 0.05; Fig.
3G). Collectively, MET activation after imatinib therapy had a
prosurvival effect, and MET inhibition enhanced imatinib efﬁcacy
in vitro and in a human xenograft model.
MET inhibition increases the effects of imatinib in KitV558del/þ
mice
We next investigated whether MET inhibition enhanced the
response to imatinib therapy in KitV558del/þ mice. Tumors treated
for 2 weeks with the combination of imatinib and crizotinib
were smaller than tumors treated with imatinib alone (mean
tumor weight, 57 vs. 78 mg; P < 0.001; Fig. 4A). To examine
further the effects of dual inhibition, we analyzed MET and KIT
signaling. Combined MET and KIT inhibition dramatically
reduced phosphorylated KIT and MET and their downstream
mediators STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2 compared with tumors
treated with imatinib alone (Fig. 4B). Immunohistochemical
analysis showed a striking decrease in KIT and cellular proliferation by Ki67 staining after combination therapy (Fig. 4C). In
contrast, crizotinib monotherapy had no effect on tumor size,
KIT immunostaining, cellular proliferation, or activated KIT and
its downstream mediators. Mice did not demonstrate signs of
toxicity and maintained their body weights throughout the
duration of treatment.
Cabozantinib, a dual MET and KIT small-molecule inhibitor, is
effective in multiple preclinical models of GIST
To verify the increased antitumor effects of dual MET and
KIT inhibition, we tested cabozantinib, a small-molecule
inhibitor approved for medullary thyroid cancer that has
activity against KIT, MET, VEGFR2, RET, AXL, TIE-2, and FLT3
(24, 35). In the imatinib-sensitive human GIST cell lines,
GIST882, GIST-T1, and HG129, cabozantinib decreased cell
viability more potently than imatinib (Fig. 5A). Cabozantinib
was also cytotoxic at nanomolar concentrations in imatinibresistant HG209 cells. We tested these ﬁndings in vivo with
established subcutaneous HG129 or HG209 xenografts. Imatinib only achieved stable disease in HG129 tumors as we had
observed previously (28), while cabozantinib was highly

Meanwhile, imatinib-resistant HG209 xenografts had an
impressive response to cabozantinib, with reduced tumor size
(Fig. 5D; mean tumor volume: vehicle, 2,131; imatinib,

KitV558del/þ mice. Compared with imatinib, cabozantinib-treated tumors were smaller at 2 weeks (Fig. 5F; mean tumor
weight: vehicle, 197; imatinib, 72; cabozantinib, 33 mg; P <
0.0001, t test) and had less KIT staining and cellular proliferation, and fewer blood vessels as measured by CD31 staining (Fig. 5G). Tumors treated with cabozantinib for 8 weeks
actually completely lacked KIT and Ki67 staining (Fig. 5H).
Taken together, cabozantinib demonstrated greater antitumor
effects than imatinib in multiple preclinical models of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST.

Discussion
The advent of small-molecule inhibitors that target tyrosine
kinases has revolutionized cancer therapy, yet cure remains elusive and acquired resistance to current agents is common. Here,
we found that MET activation can occur in untreated GIST, during
response to imatinib, and upon imatinib resistance. Although we
found MET activation in some untreated human primary gastric
GISTs, it was not present in untreated tumors from KitV558del/þ
mice, and therefore we could not assess its contribution to tumor
viability. However, MET activation developed in KitV558del/þ mice
after several weeks of imatinib therapy and its importance to
survival was evident by the increased antitumor effects of combined imatinib and crizotinib therapy. The majority of imatinibresistant human GISTs also demonstrated MET activation, and we
derived a cell line in which MET was necessary for tumor survival
in vitro and in mouse xenografts. Interestingly, the tumor had a
secondary KIT mutation, which is known to exist in over half of

resistant tumors (11). Nevertheless, the original tumor specimen
and the derived cell line had low levels of activated KIT. Thus, it
appears that a "kinase switch" occurred in these tumor cells.
However, it should be noted that the existence of activated MET
does not ensure sensitivity to a MET inhibitor, as other pathways
may be activated.
Kinase switching has been described in other tumors in
response to targeted therapy. It has been shown in EGFR-mutated
NSCLC that MET ampliﬁcation occurs in response to geﬁtinib
therapy and drives ERBB3-dependent activation of PI3K signaling
(19). In an analogous manner, Johannessen and colleagues (36)
reported that a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase
family, Cancer Osaka Thyroid (COT), activated the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutated melanoma, thereby mediating vemurafenib resistance. Compensation via multiple RTKs seems unnecessary as our phospho-RTK array demonstrated few signaling
changes between untreated imatinib-sensitive cell lines and the
imatinib-resistant HG209 cell line besides an increase in activated
MET. Compensatory signaling has been noted previously in GIST,
but only in cell lines grown in imatinib, and not in human
specimens or mouse models. An imatinib-resistant GIST-T1 subclone showed increased phosphorylation of FYN and focal adhesion kinase (FAK; ref. 13). Meanwhile, an imatinib-resistant
GIST882 subclone had decreased phosphorylated KIT and overexpression of AXL and MET (14). Compensatory signaling likely
explains, in part, why oncogene-addicted tumors, such as GIST, do

www.aacrjournals.org

not regress completely after pharmacologic inhibition of the
driver-oncogene. Indeed, we recently reported that although the
small-molecule PLX3397 was a more potent KIT inhibitor than
imatinib (IC50 8 vs. 42 nmol/L in GIST-T1 cells), it was not
curative in KitV558del/þ mice even after 19 weeks of therapy
(28). It is likely that stronger KIT inhibition may induce greater
systemic toxicity in patients. Therefore, submaximal inhibition of
both KIT and additional compensatory kinase signaling may be a
better therapeutic strategy.
It has been demonstrated previously that HIF-1a activates the
MET promoter, causing an increase in transcription during hypoxia (22). We found in KitV558del/þ mice after prolonged imatinib
therapy that tumors became hypoxic based on an increase in
pimonidazole immunostaining and Hif1a mRNA. Nonetheless,
even after 4 weeks of imatinib therapy, intratumoral microvessel
density as measured by CD31 immunostaining did not decrease.
The mechanism of imatinib-induced hypoxia in KitV558del/þ mice
is unknown at this time. Other models have demonstrated MET
activation through increased autocrine or paracrine production of
HGF (32). Although we detected high levels of intratumoral HGF
in KitV558del/þ mouse tumors, it was not changed by imatinib,
although increased sensitivity of the MET receptor may have
occurred in the setting of hypoxia, as identiﬁed by Pennacchietti
and colleagues (22). Of note, imatinib-sensitive cell lines treated
with imatinib increased expression of activated MET without
producing HGF. Furthermore, imatinib-sensitive cell lines

MET in GIST

increased MET activation within 1 hour of imatinib therapy,
suggesting the possibility of other mechanisms of MET activation
besides hypoxia, at least in vitro. In our KitV558del/þ mouse model,
we postulate that hypoxia contributes to MET activation in vivo;
however, there are likely multiple pathways leading to MET
activation, and the mechanism remains to be fully elucidated.
Despite the increase in Met transcription after imatinib treatment,
we did not detect more total MET protein by Western blot analysis.
However, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues (Tyr1230,
Tyr1234, and Tyr1235) in the kinase domain of MET was clearly
evident as was simultaneous expression of activated GAB1, indicating that MET signaling was active. KIT and MET both activate
the PI3K, MAPK, and JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways and
thus the selective effect of KIT or MET inhibition on these signaling
pathways cannot be readily determined. However, combined
imatinib and crizotinib therapy in KitV558del/þ mice inhibited
these downstream mediators more potently than KIT or MET
inhibition alone.
Other possible mechanisms for increased MET activation in
GIST besides hypoxia or increased sensitivity to ligand stimulation include MET ampliﬁcation and mutation. In EGFR-mutated
NSCLC, MET ampliﬁcation has been shown to mediate resistance
to anti-EGFR therapy via MET/EGFR cross-talk (19). The addition
of a MET inhibitor to EGFR inhibition appears to be safe and
tolerated and may improve clinical outcomes (37). The low level
of activated KIT expression in the imatinib-resistant HG209
human GIST cell line and the reduction in activated KIT after
imatinib therapy in imatinib-sensitive cells suggest that MET and
KIT do not directly interact. Mutations of the extraceullular sema
domain and the juxtamembrane domain of MET are found in
NSCLC, mesothelioma, renal carcinoma, and melanoma (30). Xu
and colleagues (38) performed genetic sequencing of 125 GIST
specimens and detected a MET missense mutation in 16.8% of the
samples. However, in our cell lines, we did not detect MET
ampliﬁcation or mutations.
Cabozantinib demonstrated profound antitumor effects in our
multiple preclinical models of imatinib-sensitive and imatinibresistant GIST. The enhanced antitumor efﬁcacy of cabozantanib
in imatinib-sensitive human GIST xenografts was shown in a
poster at the 2013 Connective Tissue Oncology Society by Van
Looy and colleagues. Furthermore, an EORTC clinical trial testing
cabozantinib in refractory GIST is planned. The mechanism of the
profound antitumor effect we observed was likely multifactorial.
Because combined therapy with imatinib and crizotinib was
effective, MET inhibition appeared to have contributed to the
efﬁcacy of cabozantinib. Cabozantinib is also known to be a more
potent KIT inhibitor than imatinib (IC50 5 vs. 100 nmol/L;
refs. 24, 39). Indeed, prolonged cabozantinib therapy in
KitV558del/þ mice caused hair depigmentation on the head and
face, indicating potent KIT inhibition because KIT is necessary for
melanocyte development (40). This was similar to, but much less,
than the depigmentation that we observed after PLX3397 treatment (28). There were likely antiangiogenic effects of cabozantinib given that it inhibits MET, VEGFR2, and TIE-2. Human GISTs
are quite vascular, and a high microvessel density has been
associated with increased tumor size, mitotic count, VEGF expres-

sion, and cellular proliferation, and is a marker of poor prognosis
(41). KitV558del/þ mouse tumors treated with cabozantinib had
lower microvessel density compared with imatinib and combined
imatinib and crizotinib therapy. Although it is possible that
cabozantinib acted on additional kinase targets, our phosphoRTK array did not identify ALK, FLT3, or RET as being activated.
Importantly, animals that received cabozantinib (or combined
imatinib and crizotinib) did not show signs of toxicity.
Thus, activated MET appears to be an important target in
imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST, as demonstrated
in multiple preclinical models. Given that most patients who
develop imatinib resistance eventually experience disease progression on the three currently approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib, there is an urgent need
for additional therapeutic options, and our ﬁndings have immediate clinical relevance.
