ABSTRACT:
Increased COX-2 expression directly correlates with glioma grade and is
associated with shorter survival in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. COX-2 is also
regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor signaling which is important in the
pathogenesis of GBMs. However, COX-2 expression has not been previously shown
to directly alter malignancy of GBMs. Id1 is a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH)
family of transcriptional repressors that act as dominant-negative inhibitors of basicHLH factors. This factor has been shown to be regulated by COX-2 in breast carcinoma
cells and recent studies suggest that Id1 may also be involved in the genesis/
progression of gliomas. We now show that COX-2 increases the aggressiveness of
GBM cells. GBM cells with COX-2 overexpression show increased growth of colonies
in soft agar. Tumorigenesis in vivo is also increased in both subcutaneous flank and
orthotopic intracranial tumor models. COX-2 overexpression induces Id1 expression in
two GBM cell lines suggesting a role for Id1 in glioma transformation/tumorigenesis.
Furthermore, we find direct evidence of a role for Id1 with significant suppression of
in vitro transformation and in vivo tumorigenesis in COX-2-overexpressing GBM cells
where Id1 has been knocked down. In fact, Id1 is even more efficient at enhancing
transformation/tumorigenesis of GBM cells than COX-2. Finally, GBM cells with COX2 or Id1 overexpression show greater migration/invasive potential and tumors that
arise from these cells also display increased microvessel density, results in line with
the increased malignant potential seen in these cells. Thus, COX-2 enhances the
malignancy of GBM cells through induction of Id1.

INTRODUCTION

family of transcriptional regulators, acting as dominant
negative repressors of basic-HLH (bHLH) transcription
factors [11-13]. Mechanistically, Id proteins dimerize
with bHLH factors to repress their functions. Id
proteins can inhibit various cellular processes including
apoptosis and cellular differentiation. Four members
of this family have been identified (Id1-4). These
factors have both common and unique activities. With
respect to its role in the development and maintenance
of cancers, Id1 overexpression is seen in a variety of
solid tumors and appears to affect a number of cellular
processes associated with malignancies [14, 15]. In fact,
high Id1 levels correlate strongly with poor prognosis,
chemoresistance and tumor metastases. Id1 expression
in human glioma specimens has also been reported and
positively correlates with tumor grade [16]. Recently,

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible
isoform of cyclooxygenases that catalyzes conversion of
arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and other eicosanoids
[1]. COX-2 is overexpressed in many cancers and
contributes to tumor development and progression [2-4].
Elevated COX-2 is associated with increased angiogenesis,
tumor invasion and promotion of tumor cell resistance to
apoptosis [5-8]. Previous studies revealed that COX-2 is
overexpressed in many gliomas and expression level, in
particular, is positively correlated with tumor grade [9,
10]. Furthermore, elevated COX-2 levels correlate with
earlier recurrence and shorter survival in glioma patients
[10].
Id proteins belong to the helix-loop-helix (HLH)

glioma-initiating cells (GICs) have been found to display
high levels of Id1 [17]. Moreover, TGF-β inhibitors were
found in an animal model to prevent glioma initiation
and recurrence by reducing Id1 expression and depleting
this GIC population [17]. This work suggests that high
Id1 levels may correlate with aggressive behavior and
poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. A more recent
study found in a mouse model of gliomagenesis that a
subpopulation of tumor cells displaying high levels of Id1
has high self-renewal capacity consistent with a role of Id1
in propagation of glioma stem cells [18].
While COX-2 expression is linked to more
aggressive glioblastomas [10], this enzyme has never
been directly demonstrated to affect the transforming/
tumorigenic potential of glioma cells. In addition, COX2 has been shown to regulate Id1 expression in a breast
carcinoma line [19]. However, no further work has been
reported this link in any other systems. In the present
study, we report that COX-2 overexpression in human
glioma cells increases their expression of Id1 protein
and enhances their in vitro transforming and in vivo
tumorigenic potentials. We further show that COX-2dependent glioma transformation/tumorigenesis requires

induction of Id1 and that Id1 overexpression also enhances
glioma transformation/tumorigenesis. Finally, COX-2 and
Id1 overexpression can both increase the invasive capacity
of glioma cells and promote angiogenesis in xenograft
tumors derived from these glioma cells.

RESULTS
Overexpression of COX2 in glioma cell lines leads
to increased Id1 expression.
A previous study revealed that COX-2-driven
PGE2 induces expression of Id1 in breast cancer cells
[19]. Therefore, we became interested in testing whether
overexpression of COX-2 results in Id1 expression in
glioma cells. To approach this question, we first infected
SF767 and LN229 glioma cells with a retroviral expression
vector containing COX-2 cDNA to generate pooled
derivatives. These cells not only overexpressed COX-2
but also Id1 (Fig. 1A). To confirm that PGE2 production
was increased in the COX-2 overexpressors, we measured

PGE2 concentration by ELISA and found significantly
increased levels in conditioned media of pooled COX2-expressing SF767 and LN229 cells (Fig. 1B). Next,
to establish whether PGE2 can induce Id1 in glioma
cells, parental SF767 and LN229 cells were treated with
increasing amounts of PGE2. As predicted, Id1 expression
increased (Fig. 1C). We have now also established in
multiple SF767 and LN229 COX-2 expressing clones,
that in nearly every case, Id1 expression increases with
COX-2 overexpression (Fig. 1D-E). To determine whether
Id1 induction is truly dependent on COX-2 activity, four

LN229/COX-2 clones were treated with the selective
COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (CXB) and assessed for Id1
expression by immunoblot analysis. In each case, elevated
expression of Id1 was significantly reduced by CXB
treatment (Fig. 1F).

cells and two SF767/COX-2 clones (4L and 9, see Fig.
1D) which express differing levels of both COX-2 and
Id1. Both clones formed significantly more colonies
in soft agar than corresponding control cells (Fig. 2A).
We next sought to determine whether increased in vitro
transforming potential was due to COX-2 activity. This
soft agar assay was therefore repeated in the presence of
the COX-2 inhibitor CXB and led to near abolishment of
colony formation by SF767/COX-2 cells (Fig. 2A). Since
we hypothesized that Id1 is a factor downstream of COX-2
enhancing its ability to alter transformation of glioma cells,
we next assessed whether Id1 overexpression leads to
increased soft agar colony formation. Expression vectors
containing Id1 and corresponding control were introduced
into the LN229 and SF767 glioma cells and immunoblot
analysis confirms significant Id1 overexpression (Fig.

vector only controls revealed a significant increase in the
colony forming capabilities of glioma cells expressing
Id1 (Fig. 2C). To prove that Id1 is a critical downstream
factor important in COX-2-mediated transformation,
we next assessed growth in soft agar after knockdown
of Id1 expression in SF767/COX-2 cells. Two siRNAs
targeting different regions of the Id1 gene were transiently

introduced into SF767/COX-2 cells either individually
or together and showed significant suppression of
Id1 expression (Fig. 2C). A representative clone 4L
immunoblot is shown in Fig. 2C but similar results
were obtained with clone 9 (data not shown). Since the
greatest knockdown was noted with a combination of the
two siRNAs, this mixture was introduced into SF767/
COX-2 cells prior to seeding into soft agar. In each case,
Id1 knockdown resulted in significant decreases in the
formation of soft agar colonies (Fig. 2C). We next sought
to achieve long-term suppression of Id1 in preparation
for in vivo analysis by infecting our glioma cells with
a retroviral vector expressing shRNA against Id1.
Immunoblot analysis showed that Id1 protein level was
significantly suppressed in SF767/COX-2 cells following
introduction of shRNA vector (Fig. 2D). Consistent
with the results described above, colony formation was
significantly reduced for both SF767/COX-2 clones
compared to controls (Fig. 2D). These results show that
in vitro transformation of glioma cells is increased by
expression of both COX-2 and Id1 and that Id1 appears
to be a critical factor downstream of COX-2 important for
this process.

COX-2 and Id1 enhance glioma cell tumor growth
in vivo.
These encouraging results prompted us to
further study the potential effect of COX-2 and Id1
overexpression on in vivo growth of glioma cells. We first
chose to test LN229 glioma cells overexpressing COX-2
or Id1 along with the corresponding vector only control
(Ctr) for growth as subcutaneous tumors on the flank of
nude mice. Two different sets of experiments consistently
showed that xenograft tumors derived from LN229/
COX-2 and /Id1 cells grow significantly faster than their
corresponding vector control (Table 1). In particular, Id1
overexpression had a stronger effect on the growth of
LN229-derived tumors than COX-2. Next, we sought to
confirm that COX-2 enhances growth of subcutaneous
tumors in another glioma cell line (SF767). In this
experiment, we also tested whether COX-2-mediated
enhancement of tumorigenesis could be treated with the
COX-2 inhibitor CXB. SF767/Ctr and /COX-2 (clone 4L)
were injected into the flank of nude mice and allowed to
grow for 28 days. Mice were treated with either vehicle
only (V) or CXB (150 mg/kg/day by oral gavage) for
duration of the experiment and tumors were dissected and
weighed after 4 weeks of growth. As shown on the graph,
COX-2 overexpression in SF767 significantly increased
tumor growth in mice treated with vehicle only (Fig. 3A).
Furthermore, CXB treatment reduced growth of COX-2
overexpressors but not corresponding control tumors (Fig.
3A). As expected, the proliferative indices of flank tumors
derived from SF767/COX-2 cells were significantly

higher than those of tumors derived from SF767/Ctr cells
(Fig. 3B). Finally, we tested whether COX-2-mediated
tumorigenesis also required Id1. The LN229/COX-2 line
expressing either shId1 or corresponding control was
again used. Expression of shId1 results in a significant
knockdown of Id1 and, as is readily evident on the graph,
a significant decrease in tumorigenic potential (Fig. 3C).
Therefore, these results strongly suggest that COX-2
overexpression enhances not only in vitro transformation
of glioma cells but also in vivo tumor growth in a process
that is mainly mediated by Id1.
With increased tumorigenicity in a subcutaneous
xenograft model, we next sought to verify that
overexpression of both COX-2 and Id1 would also
enhance tumorigenicity in an orthotopic tumor model.
LN229 cells engineered to overexpress COX-2 and Id1
with corresponding control were intracranially injected
(with 5x105 cells) into nude mice and animals followed
for survival. Brain tumors derived from LN229/COX-2
and LN229/Id1 cells were visibly larger than those derived
from corresponding control cells harvested at the same
time point (Fig. 4A). The median survival times of mice
harboring LN229/Ctr cells (n = 27), LN229/COX-2 cells
(n = 19) and LN229/Id1 cells (n = 20) were 76, 49 and
21 days, respectively, and the curves were significantly

different (p-value < 0.0001) by log-rank test (Fig. 4B). To
assess the role of Id1 in increased tumorigenic potential
due to COX-2 in our orthotopic model, LN229/COX-2
expressing shId1 and corresponding control cells were
injected intracranially and mice were again followed
for survival. As expected, the control group (n = 22)
had a median survival of 40 days which increased to 87
days with knockdown of Id1 (n = 21). This difference
in survival was again significantly different (p-value <
0.0001) by log-rank test (Fig. 4C). Thus, both COX-2 and
Id1 expression also enhances tumorigenicity of glioma
cells in an intracranial tumor model.

COX-2 and Id1 increase microvessel density in
glioma xenograft tumors.
Our results above indicate that overexpression of
both COX-2 and Id1 promotes the tumorigenic potential
of glioma cells. Since microvascular proliferation is a
hallmark of greater malignancy and a cardinal feature of
glioblastomas, we were interested in determining whether
COX-2 or Id1 overexpression will lead to increased
angiogenesis. This was assessed by performing CD31
immunofluorescent staining of xenograft tumor samples
and quantitating the microvessel counts. Microvessel

density of flank tumors derived from SF767/Ctr and /
COX-2 4L were initially compared. The COX-2overexpressing tumors showed a higher level of staining
with anti-CD31 antibody (Fig. 5A). Quantitation of
microvessel density in the COX-2-overexpressing tumors
revealed an average increase of 2.5-fold compared with
the corresponding control tumors (Fig. 5B). We next
assessed microvessel density in flank tumors derived from
LN229 cells overexpressing COX-2 or Id1 along with
corresponding control. Again, quantitation of vasculature
in flank tumors derived from LN229/COX-2 and /Id1
cells revealed a significant increase in microvessel count
in comparison with control tumors (Fig. 5C). Finally,
similar to our results demonstrating a significant role for
Id1 expression in COX-2-mediated transformation and

tumorigenesis, we found that shRNA knockdown of Id1
in LN229/COX-2 cells results in about 60% decrease in
microvessel density with this representing a statistically
significant difference (Fig. 5D).

COX-2 and Id1 promote migration and invasion
of glioma cells.
Another feature important to the malignancy of
glioblastomas is invasive capacity. COX-2 expression has
been linked with an invasive cancer phenotype in multiple
other systems. Therefore, we sought to determine whether
COX-2 and Id1 overexpression will promote the migration
and invasiveness of glioma cells. The migratory/invasive
capacity of glioma cells was assessed by a Matrigel assay
performed with Boyden chamber inserts in a 24-well plate
as described in the Methods section. Forced expression of
both COX-2 and Id1 in LN229 cells significantly enhanced

invasive potential with migration through the Matrigel
coated invasion chambers compared to the corresponding
LN229 control cells (Fig. 6A). To assess the role of Id1 in
COX-2-mediated migration/invasion, we suppressed Id1
expression in LN299/COX-2 cells with siRNAs against
Id1 and then evaluated the ability of these cells to migrate
through Matrigel invasion chambers. We again used the
same two siRNAs to target Id1 that were used previously
(Fig. 2C). These siRNAs could effectively knockdown Id1
expression in LN229/COX-2 cells when introduced both
individually or together with most efficient suppression
using the combination (Fig. 6B, upper panel). Repeat of
the invasion assay with LN229/COX-2 cells transfected
with either control (siC) or the two Id1 (si1/2) siRNAs
and showed that knockdown of Id1 significantly reduced
the ability of these cells to traverse through Matrigel in the
invasion chamber (Fig. 6B, lower panel).

colonies in soft agar and in vivo as xenograft tumors in
nude mice and these effects are mainly mediated by Id1.
Thirdly, COX-2 overexpression promotes important GBM
phenotypes including tumor angiogenesis and invasive
potential at least in part through induction of Id1. Finally,
Id1 also enhances our ability to grow out GICs, or glioma
stem cells as neurospheres in tumors that overexpress this
transcriptional regulator.
The role of COX-2 in tumor angiogenesis is wellestablished [8, 22, 23] and specific inhibitors of this
enzyme have been explored as part of anti-angiogenic
“cocktails” used in therapy for various malignancies
including glioblastoma [24-26]. In our current report, we
clearly show that COX-2 expression is pro-angiogenic
in gliomas with increased microvessel density in tumors
derived from glioma cells engineered to overexpress COX2 (Fig. 5). While the role of the Ids in angiogenesis is less
recognized, this class of protein also has essential proangiogenic activities [27, 28]. In agreement with this, Id1
overexpression can also increase microvessel density in
xenograft tumors derived from glioma cells overexpressing
Id1 (Fig. 5B). More importantly, knockdown of Id1
expression in glioma cells overexpressing COX-2 reduced
the microvessel count in tumors derived from such cells
by roughly half (Fig. 5C). While defining the precise
mechanism by which Id1 influences angiogenesis in
glioblastoma is beyond the scope of this current study,
some studies suggest potential factors involved in this
process. Tanaka et al. found that E2-2, a basic HLH
transcription factor, can suppress expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and
Id1-mediated inhibition of E2-2 may enhance VEGFR2
expression and angiogenesis [29]. Additionally, Id1 can
downregulate the angiogenic inhibitor thrombospondin-1
(TSP1) and promote neovascularization [30, 31]. Finally,
Id1 has been linked with glioma stem cell propagation [17,
20, 21] which may contribute to increased angiogenesis
since these stem-like cancer cells can differentiate in
vascular endothelial cells promoting tumor angiogenesis
[32-35].
The ability to infiltrate along white matter tracts is
a hallmark feature of glioblastomas and remains a key
reason why surgery is unable to completely eradicate this
disease [36]. We found that overexpression of both COX-2
and Id1 in the LN229 glioma cell line results in a greater
potential for migration in a matrigel invasion assay (Fig.
6A). This suggests that these factors may play an important
contributory role in the glioblastoma invasion phenotype.
Glioblastoma invasive ability has also been associated
with certain angiogenic regulators [37, 38] linking these
different phenotypes that are positively altered by COX-2
and Id1. Like its role in COX-2-mediated angiogenesis,
Id1 is also critical for COX-2-mediated migration/invasion
of glioma cells with a significant reduction in the migration
of LN229/COX-2 cells when Id1 expression has been
knocked down (Fig. 6B). Consistent with our findings,

Id1 overexpression enhances the formation of
neurospheres from glioma tumors.
Given the recent reports that Id1 plays a significant
role in maintaining glioma stem cells [17, 18, 20, 21], we
were interested in determining whether it would also do
so in our tumor system. To assess whether Id1 enhances
growth of glioma stem cells, we harvested flank tumors
derived from LN229/Ctr and LN229/Id1 cells and made
single cell suspensions that were then cultured in serumfree conditions designed to promote proliferation of neural
stem cells within neurospheres. Formation of neurospheres
from cells derived from these tumors was quantitated by
determining the average number of neurospheres that
grow out after 7 days when seeded with 1000 cells/well
(on a 96-well plate). Under these conditions, almost no
neurospheres developed from cells derived from LN229/
Ctr tumors while neurosphere developed in nearly every
well from cells derived from LN229/Id1 tumors (Fig. 7A).
Representative pictures show clear formation of cellular
clusters representing early neurosphere formation in
tumors overexpressing Id1 while corresponding cultures
of cells from control tumors do not show this clustering
(Fig. 7B).

DISCUSSION
In our current study, we find that overexpression
of COX-2 in human glioma cells increases the malignant
potential of these cells by enhancing expression of Id1.
This conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence.
First, forced expression of COX-2 in two human glioma
cell lines leads to elevated expression of Id1 and the COX2 inhibitor CXB dramatically inhibits the expression of Id1
in COX-2-overexpressing LN229 cells. Secondly, forced
expression of COX-2 increases the malignancy of human
glioma cells as evidenced by increased growth in vitro as

Id proteins has been shown to enhance tumor migration
and invasion by upregulation of metalloproteinases and
semaphorin 3F [39, 40].
As previously stated, COX-2 overexpression
is linked with higher grade gliomas [9]. In addition,
elevated levels of COX-2 have been shown to be an
independent negative prognostic factor in glioblastoma
patients [10]. We have also previously shown COX-2
regulation by signaling pathways arising from epidermal
growth factor receptor accepted to be important in glioma
pathogenesis [41-43]. These results suggest that COX2 is important in the pathogenesis of glioblastomas and
may be a good therapeutic target. Our current work
further supports this idea with the direct demonstration
that COX-2 enhances the malignancy of human glioma
cells. The New Approaches to Brain Tumor Therapy
(NABTT) consortium (now part of the Adult Brain Tumor
Consortium) has tested the utility of CXB with standard
radiation and temozolomide in the upfront treatment of
glioblastoma patients and found overall survival to be on
the order of what is seen in glioblastoma patients treated
with just RT and temozolomide [44]. However, this was a
relatively small study with no selection for glioblastomas
with high COX-2 expression, the subgroup that would be
most likely to respond to CXB therapy. Given our results,
it may be reasonable to consider another trial exploring the
utility of CXB in glioblastomas that display higher COX-2
expression.
Our identification of Id1 as a critical factor
downstream of COX-2 important for its activity in
glioma cells is particularly interesting and consistent
with the work of others linking COX-2 with Id1. Lei et
al. found potential association between Id1 and COX2 for angiogenesis in gastric cancer [45]. Subbramiah
et al. also found that COX-2-derived prostaglandin E2
can transcriptionally upregulate Id1 expression in breast
carcinoma cells [19]. More recently, several groups have
demonstrated links between glioblastoma malignancy
and Id1. Anido et al. found that TGF-β signaling is linked
to high Id1 expression in their glioblastoma models and
specific inhibition of TGF-β in their models can reduce
the glioma initiating cell (GIC) population through
suppression of Id1 expression [17]. Niola et al. found
that the Id family proteins can affect the aggressiveness
of gliomas in a mouse tumor model and are needed to
maintain GICs in their perivascular niche where they must
reside to maintain self-renewal capabilities [20]. Finally,
Soroceanu et al. found that Id1 increases the invasive
phenotype in gliomas and can similarly enhance the
aggressiveness of orthotopic tumors [21]. Our results are
consistent with these previous reports and taken together
suggest that the Id proteins may be a good therapeutic
target in glioblastomas although development of effective
inhibitors will be needed before this can be clinically
tested.
In summary, we show that COX-2-dependent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transformation of glioma cells is dependent on Id1
expression. While high COX-2 expression is clearly
linked to increasing glioma grade and is associated with
worse outcomes in patients with this disease [9, 10], to
our knowledge, our report is the first to demonstrate that
COX-2 has direct transforming activity by increasing
the malignancy of glioma cells both in vitro and in
vivo. We have also identified a novel link between
COX-2 and Id1 in gliomas and demonstrated that Id1
is a critical factor downstream of COX-2 required for
enhancing the aggressiveness of glioma cells. Finally,
our work continues to add to the growing evidence that
Id proteins are important in the aggressiveness of gliomas
and demonstrates additional situations where Id protein
expression can be regulated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids
The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and
rat COX-2 cDNAs were inserted downstream of the CMV
promoter in an MuLV-based retroviral vector containing
the neomycin resistance gene (pKX95) to create pKX139
and pKX104C, respectively, as described previously [46].
Human Id1 cDNA (OriGene Technologies Inc., Rockville,
MD) was inserted downstream of the CMV promoter
in the pKX95 to create pKX95/Id1. Retroviral vectors
encoding human Id1 and control shRNAs (pSM2c-based
system) were purchased (Open Biosystems, a subsidiary of
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA).

Cell lines, culture conditions and transfections
Glioma cell lines (SF767, LN229, and their
derivatives) were cultured in high glucose DME media
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), Na pyruvate (1 mM) and
penicillin (100 U/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) unless
otherwise indicated. Phoenix cells were cultured in the
above media without Na pyruvate. Retroviral vectors
were transiently transfected into Phoenix cell by CaPO4
precipitation. To generate glioma cell lines (clones
and pools) stably expressing COX-2 or Id1, SF767 and
LN229 cells were successively infected with conditioned
media from transfected Phoenix cells and selected
with 1000 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
For transient Id1 knockdown by siRNA suppression,
SF767 and LN229 cells were transfected with siRNA
against Id1 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville,
IA) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The Stealth
RNAi medium GC duplex-negative control (Invitrogen)
was used to control for sequence-independent effects of
introducing short RNA duplexes into cells. For stable

Id1 knockdown, SF767/COX-2 and LN229/COX-2 cells
were successively infected with conditioned media from
the Phoenix cells transfected with the shId1 retroviral
construct or corresponding control and selected with
2 μg/ml puromycin. For culturing under neural stem
cell conditions, a single cell suspension was made by
mincing the indicated subcutaneous tumors, treating
with Collagenase/Dispase (1 mg/ml in PBS) (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), passing through a
70 micron mesh and further isolating single cells on a
Ficoll gradient. The indicated numbers of viable single
cells were seeded in NeuroCult NS-A Basal Media with
10% NeuroCult NS-A Proliferation Supplement, Heparin
solution (2 µg/ml), rh bFGF (10 ng/ml) and rh EGF (20
ng/ml) (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC,
Canada) for the indicated times. Standard aseptic culture
techniques were used to propagate the various cells used
in this report. All cell lines are periodically checked for
mycoplasma infection by PCR (last tested in 2012). Cell
line authentication by STR analysis was performed on
2/2013 for all parental glioma cell lines studied.

and this was allowed to solidify on top of the bottom
agar media layer. An additional 1 ml layer of media with
0.3% bacto agar was allowed to solidify above the agar
media layer that contained the cells. Each well was further
supplemented with 0.5 ml of fresh DME media once a
week until colonies have grown to appropriate size. The
colonies were visualized after staining with 0.005% crystal
violet.

Tumor xenograft models
Animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Emory
University. Flank and intracranial xenograft models
utilized 4-5 week old female athymic nude mice (Harlan
Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). Flank tumors (2 sites/
mouse) were seeded by subcutaneous injection of the
indicated number of glioma cells in 200 μl of HBSS
containing 10% matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
For intracranial inoculation, anesthetized nude mice were
placed in a stereotaxic instrument and cells (5 × 105 in 5
µl of HBSS) were stereotactically inoculated into the right
striatum, 3 mm below the dural surface. Mice harboring
tumor were housed and maintained to survival endpoints
under specific pathogen-free conditions. Mice brains
harboring tumors were harvested, formalin fixed/paraffin
embedded, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin/
eosin. Images were acquired using the Nanozoomer
2.0HT digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu Corporation,
Bridgewater, NJ) and visualized on the Image Scope
software (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA). To evaluate
the effect of COX-2 inhibition on COX-2 overexpressing
flank tumors, celecoxib (150 mg/kg) or vehicle only (0.5%
methylcellulose:10% PEG 200) was administered daily by
oral gavage before tumor harvest.

Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, enzyme
immunoassay and antibodies
All Western blots were done by standard procedures
as previously described [41]. Blots were probed with
antibodies against COX-2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann
Arbor, MI) and Id1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA). As loading controls, blots were also probed
with antibodies against EIF5α (Santa Cruz). Blots were
detected using anti-rabbit or mouse IgG secondary
antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and
chemiluminescent substrate according to standard
procedures. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors
were immunohistochemically stained for Ki-67 using a
commercially available kit (Biocare Medical, Concord,
CA) according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels were assessed by enzyme
immunoassay. Cells of interest are seeded in 12-well
plates, grown to 90% confluence and then cultured in fresh
300 µl serum-free medium for 24 hours. PGE2 released
into this conditioned media was measured in triplicate by
enzyme immunoassay following manufacture’s procedure
(Cayman Chemical) and normalized to protein content in
lysates.

Microvessel density
Flank tumor frozen sections (5 μm) were fixed in
cold methanol and stained with rat anti-mouse CD31
monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) as previously
described [47]. CD31-stained slides were observed
by fluorescent microscopy and images captured by
an associated digital camera. Images were acquired
and stored using the AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss
Microscopy, Jena, Germany).

Soft-agar colony-forming assay

Cell Invasion Assay

Soft agar assay was performed in six-well plates by
standard procedures. Briefly, a bottom layer consisting
of 0.5% bacto agar in 1 ml of DME media supplemented
with 10% FBS was first allowed to solidify in each well.
The cells of interest (6 × 103cells/well) were then mixed
in 1 ml of the same media containing 0.3% bacto agar
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Invasion assay was performed using the 24-well
Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences). 2.5 ×
104cells in 500 µl serum-free DME medium containing
1% BSA were loaded into the top inserts. DME medium
with 1% FBS was added to the lower chamber (750 μl)
1250

as a chemoattractant. After incubation for 48 hours at
37°C, non-invasive cells were removed from the top of
the Matrigel with a cotton-tipped swab. Invasive cells
that migrated through 8 μm pores to the underside of the
membrane were fixed and stained using Diff-Quick stain
kit (IMEB Inc, San Marcos, CA) before counting under a
microscope.
