Abstract
The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway is a major target for cancer therapy. As a
strategy to induce the maximal inhibition of this pathway in cancer cells, we combined allosteric mTOR
inhibitors (rapamycin and RAD001) with a dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor (PI-103). Both in vitro and in vivo,
the combination exhibited more activity than single agents in human ovarian and prostate cancer cells that
harbor alterations in the pathway. At the molecular level, combined inhibition of mTOR prevented the rebound
activation of Akt that is seen after treatment with rapamycin and its analogues and caused more sustained
inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, the combination strongly inhibited the expression of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR downstream proteins. In particular, it showed greater activity than the single agents in inhibiting the
phosphorylation of 4EBP1, both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in selective inhibition of CAP-dependent
translation. A proteomic approach was used to confirm the identification of c-Myc as the key regulator for
the reduction in downstream proteins affected by the combined inhibition of mTOR. In conclusion, the
combination of a catalytic and an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR shows greater activity, without a concomitant
increase in toxicity, than either drug alone, and this may have therapeutic implications for inhibiting this
pathway in the clinical setting. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4573–84. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a key
signal-transduction pathway that regulates many physiologic
functions in cells, and its deregulation has been associated
with malignant transformation and apoptotic resistance
(1–5).
PI3Ks are activated in response to many extracellular
stimuli such as growth factors and hormones. Activated PI3Ks
localize in proximity of the plasma membrane lipid substrate
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate (PIP2), allowing its conversion to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). The
lipid phosphatase PTEN counterbalances the process dephosphorylating PIP3 to PIP2, thus terminating PI3K-dependent
signaling (6, 7).
PIP3 allows the recruitment of the main PI3K downstream
effector Akt/PKB at the membrane level and its subsequent

activation through the phosphorylation of threonine (Thr)308, by PDK1, and serine (Ser)-473, by the mTORC2 complex
(8–10). Akt targets several substrates and promotes protein
synthesis and cell growth through phosphorylation of the
negative regulator of mTOR, the TSC1/TSC2 complex (11).
mTORC1 activation positively regulates mRNA translation
initiation through its downstream effectors p70S6K and
4EBP1 (12). Activated p70 can phosphorylate the 40S ribosomal protein S6, increasing translation of mRNAs with a 50 terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) tract such as ribosomal proteins and elongation factors (13). Phosphorylation of 4EBP1
leads to its detachment from eIF4E, allowing eIF4E to complex
with eIF4G to form the eIF4F initiation complex, driving
increased cap-dependent translation of these mRNAs with
a long, highly structured 50 -untranslated region (UTR) such as
cyclin D1, c-Myc, and VEGF (12, 14).
PI3K and mTOR inhibitors have been extensively studied in
various types of cancer with, at least at the preclinical level,
promising effects. At a clinical level, the results have been less
encouraging although clinical evidence of benefit has been
reported (15, 16). Drug combinations are being given increasing importance in clinical settings as the most appropriate
approach to target tumors and avoid acquired resistance.
Activity of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors in combination with classical anticancer agents has proved highly
effective in several experimental systems (17–19). Combining
drugs targeting different pathways inside the cell is likely to be
effective in cells that adopt alternative or compensatory pathway activation. Furthermore, an interesting approach could be
to aim for the same pathway at different levels or with

molecules targeting different sites of the protein, thus enhancing the chances of completely shutting down the signaling
cascade.
We analyzed the activity of the dual PI3K–mTOR inhibitor
PI-103 either as single agent or in a combination. It exerts at
least additive effects with rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor
also affecting the mTOR pathway. The results, both in vitro
and in vivo, appear to correlate with the molecular changes
induced by the drugs individually and in combination.
Our results provide evidence that targeting mTOR with 2
different inhibitors could be a new strategy worth exploring to
achieve better antitumor activity.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and drug treatments
Human ovarian carcinoma Skov-3 and Ovcar-3, human
prostate carcinoma PC3, and human breast MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. Human
lung carcinoma A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM).
Cells were treated with different concentrations of rapamycin, PI-103 or both. The sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
was used to measure cell proliferation as reported previously
(20). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (Cell proliferation ELISA; Roche) was used as an additional test. Combination effects of PI-103 and rapamycin were quantified as
described (ref. 21; Supplementary Methods). Experiments
were run at least in triplicate. The 3 replicates for each time
point were pooled and used for fluorescence-activated cellsorting (FACS) analysis of DNA content (see Supplementary
Methods).
Western blotting analysis
Proteins were extracted and visualized using standard
techniques, as reported (22) and detailed in Supplementary
Materials.
Real-time PCR
RNA was extracted using SV Total RNA Isolation System
(Promega) and retrotranscribed using the High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). GoTaq
qPCR Master Mix (Promega) was used to quantify c-Myc and
lysyl tRNA synthetase (KARS). Primer sequences are reported
in Supplementary Table S1. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was
carried out using the 7900HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems).
Determination of eIF4E-4EBP1 complexes
Total protein extracts (100 mg) were incubated with 7methyl-GTP-Sepharose (Amersham) overnight at 4 C to capture eIF4E and its binding partners. The beads were washed
twice with immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mmol/L TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L NaF, 5 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor); bound complexes were solubilized in 30 mL of loading buffer, and proteins
were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were done as
previously described.

Luciferase reporter assays
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates 48 hours before transfection with 2 mg of bicistronic reporter plasmids (kindly provided by Dr. Ruggero; ref. 23) using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Eight hours after transfection, cells were treated
for 24 hours with the drugs, individually or in combination.
Renilla and firefly luciferase were measured using the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Data are
expressed as the mean  SD of 2 experiments, each run in
triplicate.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis image analysis
and mass spectrometry
Differential protein expression in the total Skov-3 lysate
from untreated and treated cells was analyzed using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), computerized gel image, and
univariate statistical analysis for comparative proteomics
(Supplementary Methods). In-gel trypsin digestion and tandem mass spectrometry for protein identification were conducted as previously reported (24, 25). All information
concerning mass spectrometry submission parameters and
peptide/protein identification are available in Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3.
Protein-network analysis
MetaCore (GeneGo) was used to map the differently
expressed proteins into biological networks and for functional
interpretation of the protein data as detailed in Supplementary Methods.
Xenograft models
Six-week-old NCr-nu/nu mice were obtained from Harlan,
Italy. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free
conditions. Procedures involving animals and their care were
conducted in conformity with institutional guidelines that are
in compliance with national and international laws and
policies.
Exponentially growing Skov-3 and PC3 cells (7  106 cells
per mouse) were injected subcutaneously. Details of the in vivo
experiments are available in Supplementary Methods.

Results
PI-103 exerts a dose-dependent effect on cell
proliferation
To examine the in vitro cytotoxic effects of PI-103, cells from
the ovarian carcinoma cell line Skov-3 were treated with
different PI-103 concentrations (Fig. 1A). Concentrationdependent growth inhibition was associated with a specific
G1 phase arrest (Fig. 1B); in these conditions, the percentage of
dead cells was similar in control and PI-103–treated cells and
was less than 4%. Furthermore, PI-103 was able to counteract
the activation of Akt induced by insulin stimulation (Fig. 1C).
As shown in Figure 1D, PI-103 inhibited the phosphorylation of phospho-Akt (p-Akt; Ser-473) and p-p70S6K (Thr-389),
whereas Erk phosphorylation remained unchanged. As for the
mechanism of the G1 arrest, PI-103 treatment raised p27
levels, whereas p-cdc2 levels decreased.

PI-103 with rapamycin exert at least additive effects
PI-103 was tested in combination with a panel of drugs with
different mechanisms of action. The allosteric mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin gave the best indications for further analysis in
combination with PI-103. We used isobologram analysis for
qualitative assessment of synergy, additivity, or antagonism.
All of the plotted values lie below the diagonal, indicating a
synergistic effect (Fig. 2A).
To extend the results to other cell lines, we tested the
activity of PI-103 and rapamycin, singly or in combination, on
different cancer cell lines (Fig. 2B). All 5 cell lines with an
altered PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway were sensitive, to various
extents, to both drugs and showed greater sensitivity when the

2 compounds were combined. MDA-MB-231 cells, whose
pathway is unaltered, did not respond significantly to either
drug singly or to the combination. Similar results were
obtained when BrdU incorporation was determined in the
different cell lines at the end of treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S1).
Combination treatment is influenced by the sequence of
treatment
We investigated whether the effects observed on combining PI-103 and rapamycin were dependent on the treatment
schedule (Fig. 2C). Results were comparable when rapamycin and PI-103 were given simultaneously (indicated as

In Vitro and In Vivo Inhibition of PI3K/mTOR Pathway

The in vitro combination can be translated in vivo
The combination used in vitro was tested in vivo in cells
with an altered PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, using RAD001
instead of rapamycin because of its longer half-life and
stability. In the Skov-3 xenograft model, daily treatment with
PI-103 (10 mg/kg) and RAD001 (5 mg/kg) reduced the tumor
mass as compared with controls (Fig. 3A), and the combination was more active than either drugs given singly and
without any significant toxicity. Figure 3B reports the densitometric analysis of the p-Akt/Akt ratio in tumors. Similar to the
in vitro experiments, the combination lowered phosphorylation more than either PI-103 or RAD001 individually.
The same experiment was done in PC3 xenografts
(Fig. 3C). In this model, RAD001 was much more effective

combination progressed slower than PI-103–treated ones,
and only S-phase (57.5%) and a few G2 cells (7.4%) were
present.
When rapamycin was given as the second drug, it did not
completely maintain the cells arrested in G1 by PI-103. When
PI-103 was the second drug, a very high percentage of cells
were in G1 phase, indicating that those still proliferating after
rapamycin treatment had been arrested in G1 by addition of
PI-103.
At 24 hours of recovery, cells treated with the rapamycin!PI-103 schedule and the concurrent one showed delayed
cell-cycle progression, indicating that these schedules had a
more lasting effect. The other sequence gave results similar to
those of controls.

To exclude that the effect of the combination on p-Akt
levels was simply due to the sum of the effects of the 2 drugs,
we doubled the concentration of both drugs; the combination
maintained its effect, which was higher than the effect of
individual drugs (Fig. 4A, right).
As for downstream effectors of mTORC1, rapamycin
strongly inhibited p70S6K phosphorylation. The addition of
PI-103 did not boost this effect, although there was a partial
decrease in the S6 phosphorylation state, as expected, in the
PI-103 treated sample (Fig. 4B). The other downstream effector of mTORC1 showed a different situation (Fig. 4C and D).
Cells treated with the combination had a lower level of
phospho-4EBP1 (Thr-37/46) than the untreated or singledrug–treated samples. In addition, slower migrating forms
(hyperphosphorylated forms) were visible in the untreated or
single-drug–treated samples, whereas cells treated with the
combination showed only hypophosphorylated forms of
4EBP1. This was visible both in short experiments where 1
hour of treatment was followed by induction with insulin
(Fig. 4C) and in longer experiments where cells were treated
for 4 and 24 hours (Fig. 4D, left). Once again, we repeated the
experiments by doubling the concentrations of both drugs to

than PI-103 and was so active that it was difficult to see any
effect of the combination. We, therefore, gave a second
treatment cycle (when the tumors started to re-grow at a
rate comparable with that of controls) using half the RAD001
dose but the same dose of PI-103. This second cycle still
inhibited the tumor growth, although we did note a stronger
effect with the combination. Again, there was no evidence of
toxicity.
In tumors explanted and analyzed for the expression of
some PI3K downstream effectors, Akt and 4EBP-1 phosphorylation appeared to be mainly reduced after the combined
treatment, whereas p-S6 was almost completely inhibited by
RAD001 alone (Fig. 3D).

"Cotargeting" mTOR enhances inhibition of mTORC1

In Skov-3 cells (Fig. 4A, left), rapamycin increased the
amount of p-Akt (Ser-473), whereas PI-103 had a partial
inhibitory effect. The combination reduced p-Akt (Ser-473)
levels much more than the single-drug treatments. Effects
were similar in 2 other cell lines, Ovcar-3 and PC3 (Fig. 4A,

previously shown. Results were similar in Ovcar-3 and PC3
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
A dual-luciferase reporter that distinguishes cap-dependent
from cap-independent translation was used in transfection
experiments, followed by 24 hours of treatment (Fig. 5B). We
used Renilla-luciferase as the gene reporter under cap-dependent translation control and firefly luciferase, under the control of an internal ribosome-entry site (IRES), to normalize the
signal from Renilla. Renilla activity was partially reduced after
administration of the single drugs but the effect was much
stronger in the combination-treated sample.
Cap-dependent translation enhances the translation of a
subset of mRNAs characterized by a complex and structured

show that the specificity of the combination was not simply
due to the higher drug concentration (Fig. 4D, right).
To better characterize the combination's effects on translation-initiation events, total cellular protein extracts were
incubated with the cap-analogue 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose
to capture eIF4E and its cellular binding partners (Fig. 5A).
mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E co-precipitates with its most
abundant repressor 4EBP1. PI-103 and rapamycin induced a
slight association of eIF4E with 4EBP1. The combination
strongly induced the amount of hypophosphorylated 4EBP1
that could be pulled down. As expected, there was a concomitant decrease in eIF4G-associated with eIF4E. The different phosphorylation status of 4EBP1 can be seen as

50 -UTR, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, and Bcl-XL. Figure 5C
(right) shows that c-Myc protein levels were reduced by
treatment, whereas c-Myc mRNA levels (Fig. 5C, left), did
not change.
We further examined the effect of treatment on c-Myc
translation by [35S] metabolic labeling (for details, see Supplementary Methods). As indicated in Figure 5D, the combination greatly reduced the amount of newly synthesized cMyc, whereas the single drugs had only minor effects. In
contrast, the expression of PDCD4, a direct Akt and p70S6K
downstream target (26, 27; Fig. 5E), was induced by both drugs
singly, and the combination did not further enhance its
expression.
We applied an exploratory proteomic approach based on 2DE coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to compare the
proteomic profile of Skov-3 cells exposed to either the single
drugs or the combination with their untreated counterpart.
Overall, 33 of 973 protein species visualized showed a
statistically significant change in abundance as a result of
drug treatments (Supplementary Fig. S3). All these species
were positively identified by mass spectrometry and are
reported in Supplementary Table S5.

Drug treatment induced a general downregulation of the
identified proteins. There were 11 proteins whose abundance
was altered in the same direction by rapamycin and the
combination, suggesting that rapamycin was driving the
change observed with the combination.
The protein–protein interaction network was analyzed
using the "shortest path" algorithm in the MetaCore suite to
map the shortest paths of interactions among these differentially expressed proteins. After the combination treatment, the majority of these proteins were brought
together in the network with the interactions shown in
Figure 6. Eleven downregulated proteins identified in the
cells treated with the combination were directly connected
to c-Myc able to regulate their transcription. Similarly, the
shortest path algorithm connected the majority of proteins
(74%) differently expressed by rapamycin (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Again, the most prominent regulatory element in
this network was c-Myc, which interacts directly with 12
proteins whose abundance was significantly reduced by
rapamycin.
The interpretation of proteomic data provided by the
protein-interaction–network analysis was further supported

TPT1, HSPD1, and CLIC4 was only observed after rapamycin
treatment.
To validate some of the findings suggested by our network
analysis, where c-Myc is a key factor for the downregulated
proteins with the drug combination, we used chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP; for details, see Supplementary
Methods) to measure c-Myc binding to KARS promoter and
RT-PCR for assessing its mRNA levels. c-Myc ChIP showed less
precipitation of the target DNA after treatment with the 2
single drugs (Fig. 7C). The combined treatment further
enhanced the effect. In agreement with this, KARS expression
was downregulated by the combination more than it did with
the 2 single treatments (Fig. 7D). Cells overexpressing an
exogenous c-Myc without UTRs (not sensitive to translational
regulation; pCGN—c-Myc kindly provided by Dr W.P. Tansey)
showed no drop in KARS (by RT-PCR) and c-Myc (by Western
blotting analysis) after both single drugs and the combination
(Fig. 7E).

Discussion
Several mTOR inhibitors have been synthesized, and their
activity at the preclinical level is recognized. Unfortunately,
the promises of the preclinical results have not translated to
the expected clinical activity, although RAD001 has proven
activity and has been approved for the treatment of renal cell
carcinoma refractory to VEGFR inhibitors (28, 29). Single
treatment with rapamycin and its analogues (rapalogues)
activates negative feedback mechanisms leading to increased
formation of mTORC2 complex, which not only directly
phosphorylates and activates Akt (10, 30) but also promotes
eIF4E Ser-209 phosphorylation, favoring its role in the initiation complex (31).
Our strategy exploited the specificity of PI-103 for the
catalytic site of PI3K and (although to a lesser extent) of
mTOR with disassembling of mTORC1 by the allosteric inhibition of rapamycin. This should simultaneously inhibit mTOR
at both the kinase domain and the structural level.
There are few examples showing that the combined use of 2
different molecules targeting the same cellular effector
through independent inhibitory mechanisms can improve
the effects of the single drugs (32–34). We showed here that
simultaneous treatment with rapamycin/RAD001 and PI-103
blocked the rapamycin/RAD001-induced stimulation of Akt,
as expected, and that the inhibition of p-Akt was greater with
the combination than with the single drugs. At the cell-cycle
level too, we found a positive correlation between the effects in
terms of growth inhibition and the mechanism of action. The
G1 phase arrest obtained when cells were treated with the 2
drugs was, in fact, more sustained and cells re-entered cell
cycle more slowly. The schedule-dependence observed in this
study agrees with the proposed effect on cell cycle and with
other published observations. In vivo experiments confirmed
the additive effect observed in vitro.
With regard to the mechanism of action, the inhibition of
mTOR exerted by the combination not only prevented the
rebound activation of Akt observed in many tumors after
rapalogues treatment but also led to more sustained inhibi-

4582

Cancer Res; 71(13) July 1, 2011

tion of Akt phosphorylation. In addition, the combination
selectively inhibited downstream targets of mTOR. It has been
recently proposed that p70S6K mostly regulates mTOR control of cell size whereas its effects on proliferation are mainly
attributable to 4EBPs (35). Our data suggest that the combination may augment the effect on the specific downstream
signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation. Only combination therapy with rapamycin and PI-103 caused progressive
de-phosphorylation of 4EBP1 that resulted in selective inhibition of translation for CAP-site–containing structures.
Components of the translational machinery are abundant
and active in many cancers and their roles have been established (36–38). The selectivity toward the regulation of
cap-dependent translation effectors was confirmed by the
expression of some genes translated through these mechanisms (i.e., c-Myc). The fact that we did not find any change at
the transcriptional level further corroborates the evidence
that c-Myc downregulation is mediated by mTOR inhibition
of translation machinery, and the proteomic analysis further
supports this. Network generation helped with the interpretation of our proteomic data, pointing to c-Myc as the key
regulator for the majority of downstream proteins (39–41)
whose levels were reduced by the combination treatment and
by rapamycin alone. Our proteomic and network analysis thus
suggested that the c-Myc level might decrease, as confirmed
by Western blot analysis and 35S pulse labeling.
Interestingly, only the combination treatment almost
halved the expression of KARS and reduced its transcription.
KARS has been reported to be regulated by c-Myc, and the fact
that the combination can inhibit occupancy of the KARS
promoter by c-Myc (more than the inhibition by the single
drugs) strongly suggests that the effects on KARS are c-Myc
dependent. KARS is a lysyl-tRNA synthetase that catalyzes the
specific attachment of lysine to its cognate tRNA, with a
plausible consequence of an altered pool of uncharged tRNA
and/or amino acids in the cell. Because recent evidence
suggests that mTOR might respond to tRNA and/or to amino
acids (42–44), the lower expression of KARS after the combination treatment might be viewed as a cell response to
reinforce the negative regulation of the mTOR pathway.
That PDCD4 expression increased comparably after both
single and combination treatments indicates not only that
treatment mainly inhibits the mTOR pathway through 4EBP1,
and not by other members of the pathway, but also that the
combination causes no generalized translation inhibition.
Differing from the report by Choo and Blenis (45) and Choo
and colleagues (46) who showed that with rapamycin, after an
initial inhibitory effect on 4EBP1 phosphorylation, phosphorylation re-appeared, we saw no reactivation of the pathway at
least until after 24 hours of treatment. This effect might be
related to the cell specificity or other unknown alterations
affecting the pathway in this particular context.
In conclusion, in this article, we report that the combination
of a catalytic and an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR can be more
active than the single drugs acting alone. The efficacy of this
combination has been recently reported in melanoma cells
both in vitro and in vivo (47), thus supporting our present
observations. The simultaneous inhibition of the target by

action on distinct portions of the protein might be extended to
other targets and, if proven, could offer an alternative
approach to shut down a cascade of the signaling pathway.
The evidence that the combination of inhibitors acting at
different levels increased the activity but not the toxicity
upholds this possibility, which needs to be tested in wellcharacterized systems and, probably, with the new and more
selective inhibitors that are emerging, which might have
clinical implications.
