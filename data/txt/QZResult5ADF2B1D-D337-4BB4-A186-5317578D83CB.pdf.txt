Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have the highest risk of recurrence and metastasis. Because they cannot be
treated with targeted therapies, and many do not respond to
chemotherapy, they represent a clinically underserved group.
TNBC is characterized by reduced expression of metastasis
suppressors such as Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), which
inhibits tumor invasiveness. Mechanisms by which metastasis
suppressors alter tumor cells are well characterized; however,
their ability to regulate the tumor microenvironment and the
importance of such regulation to metastasis suppression are
incompletely understood. Here, we use species-speciﬁc RNA
sequencing to show that RKIP expression in tumors markedly
reduces the number and metastatic potential of inﬁltrating
tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). TAMs isolated from
nonmetastatic RKIPþ tumors, relative to metastatic RKIP
tumors, exhibit a reduced ability to drive tumor cell invasion
and decreased secretion of prometastatic factors, including

PRGN, and shed TNFR2. RKIP regulates TAM recruitment by
blocking HMGA2, resulting in reduced expression of numerous
macrophage chemotactic factors, including CCL5. CCL5 overexpression in RKIPþ tumors restores recruitment of prometastatic TAMs and intravasation, whereas treatment with the
CCL5 receptor antagonist Maraviroc reduces TAM inﬁltration.
These results highlight the importance of RKIP as a regulator of
TAM recruitment through chemokines such as CCL5. The
clinical signiﬁcance of these interactions is underscored by our
demonstration that a signature comprised of RKIP signaling and
prometastatic TAM factors strikingly separates TNBC patients
based on survival outcome. Collectively, our ﬁndings identify
TAMs as a previously unsuspected mechanism by which the
metastasis-suppressor RKIP regulates tumor invasiveness, and
further suggest that TNBC patients with decreased RKIP activity
and increased TAM inﬁltration may respond to macrophagebased therapeutics. Cancer Res; 75(19); 4063–73. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Moreover, only 30% of TNBC patients are responsive to chemotherapy (4). Therefore, there is interest in novel approaches
for treating TNBC patients, including targeting of the tumor
stroma (5).
One possible strategy is to mimic the action of physiologic
tumor metastasis suppressors such as Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP). RKIP, a member of the evolutionarily conserved
phosphatidylethanolamine family, has been implicated as a
metastasis suppressor for prostate, breast and other solid tumors
(6–8). RKIP inhibits key signaling pathways, including Raf/MAP
kinase, GRK2-regulated b-adrenergic receptor, and NFkB activation (6). Previously, RKIP was shown to suppress the expression of
many prometastatic genes in TNBC cells by inhibiting transcriptional regulators such as HMGA2 (8–10). Because previous studies have focused on the effects of metastasis suppressors in tumor
cells, their role in regulating the tumor microenvironment is
unknown.
Multiple lines of evidence have shown that the microenvironment regulates both tumor progression and metastasis. In particular, macrophages have been shown to play a dual role in
tumor growth, either driving tumor rejection or tumor progression depending on the type of macrophage activation (11).
Classical activation of macrophages by IFNg, lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), or TNFa leads to polarization of M1 macrophages that
secrete inﬂammatory cytokines important in the body's antitumor
response. M2 macrophages, activated by factors such as IL4, play
an essential role in wound healing. Secretion of factors from

Of the approximately 230,000 women diagnosed with breast
cancer each year, 15% to 20% will have triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC). The most aggressive subset of breast cancer,
TNBCs lack expression of the estrogen, progesterone, and
HER2/neu receptors. Although clinical outcomes have improved
for many patients with breast cancer, TNBC patients have higher
rates of metastasis, more aggressive tumors, higher disease burden, and early recurrence (1). In addition, this disease disproportionately affects African-American women, with rates approximately three times higher in African-American women (2, 3).

tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), thought to be M2, leads to
tumor growth, progression, and metastasis (12–14) as well drug
resistance (15). However, recent evidence suggests that this division of macrophages into two discrete subtypes incompletely
describes the range of macrophage phenotypes present in the
tumor microenvironment (16). Importantly, studies of breast
cancer patients show that CD163þ macrophage recruitment positively correlates with TNBC while negatively correlating with ERþ
and luminal tumors (17). Therefore, recruitment of alternatively
activated TAMs could play a signiﬁcant role in the outcome of
TNBC patients and explain their poor prognosis.
TAMs are recruited to mammary tumors through induction of a
variety of cytokines and chemokines, where they play essential
roles in driving metastasis. For example, TAMs recruited by CSF-1
express higher levels of VEGF-A, with increased angiogenesis in
the polyoma middle T genetically engineered mouse model for
breast cancer (18). Similarly, CCL2 was required for TAM inﬁltration in primary breast tumors as well as TAM-enabled metastatic colonization of lungs (19). Antagonists of the CCL5 receptor
(CCR5) inhibited TAM recruitment in a syngeneic mouse model
(20). Finally, recent work comparing breast tumors before and
after EMT has shown that GM-CSF is able to recruit TAMs to the
primary tumor (21, 22). Although factors enabling recruitment of
prometastatic TAMs to mammary tumors have been identiﬁed,
the regulation of these pathways by metastasis suppressors and
the speciﬁc phenotypes of these TAMs are poorly understood.
Here, we combine species-speciﬁc RNA sequencing, protein
secretion proﬁling, functional assays, and gene knockdown studies in xenograft and syngeneic breast cancer models to characterize
the effects of the metastasis-suppressor RKIP on TAMs and to
identify the molecular mechanisms that mediate these effects. Our
ﬁndings demonstrate that RKIP blocks a subset of TAMs that
secrete prometastatic factors and are enriched in human TNBC
patients. These results suggest that one mechanism by which
metastasis suppressors alter tumor invasiveness is by regulating
TAMs.

Materials and Methods
See Supplementary Methods for additional description of
methodology.
Cell culture
MDA-MB-436 and 4T1.2 cells were obtained from the ATCC.
BM1 cells were obtained from Andy Minn. Numerous vials were
frozen upon original receipt of the cells, and all work was done
within 15 passages of the initially received lines. BM1, MDA-MD436, and 4T1.2 cell lines were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL
streptomycin. Cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors for
shRNA knockdown or overexpression from GE/Dharmacon. Cells
were selected for 14 days using 3 mg/mL of puromycin or 10 mg/mL
of blasticidin after lentiviral transduction before use.
Invasion assays
A total of 2  105 BM1 cells were plated in 24-well BD Transwell
inserts coated with growth factor–depleted Matrigel as previously
described (8). After 24 hours, inserts were transferred to a new well
and stained with 4 ng/mL of Calcein AM for 1 hour. Stained cells
were then dissociated using gentle shaking for 1 hour at 37 C and
150 RMP in dissociation buffer from Trevigen. Fluorescence was

4064 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

measured using a Victor X3 ﬂuorescent plate reader with excitation at 465 nm and emission at 535 nm.
Tumor-associated macrophage isolations
Tumors were grown to approximately 0.2 g before being
harvested. Tumors were dissociated using the Miltenyi Biotech
Human Tumor Dissociation Kit using C-tubes. Cells were ﬁltered
through a 70-mm mesh ﬁlter. Mononuclear cells were isolated
using Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM (GE Healthcare) gradient centrifugation at 420 RPM for 40 minutes. Macrophages were then
obtained using CD11b-positive selection beads from Milteny
Biotech. Flow cytometry with CD11b, F4/80, CD45, CD11c,
CD205, and CCR5 was performed to determine the purity and
heterogeneity of isolated TAMs.
Conditioned media
For THP-1 conditioned media (CM), 5  106 THP-1 cells were
plated in a T-75 ﬂask with 5 mL of 10% serum containing DMEM.
Media were collected after 24 hours and cells and cell debris were
removed by centrifugation.
For tumor-derived macrophages, 5  105 TAMs were plated in
1-well of a 6-well plate. After 30 minutes, cells were washed with
PBS to ensure only viable macrophages attached to the plate
remained. Cells were incubated for 24 hours to obtain CM in
serum-free DMEM. Cells and cell debris were removed by
centrifugation.

Results
Nonmetastatic RKIPþ tumors contain fewer macrophages
To compare metastatic and nonmetastatic tumors that
were isogenic, we used highly metastatic BM1 derivatives of the
MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cell line stably expressing either the
metastasis-suppressor RKIPþ or a vector control (Supplementary
Fig. S1; refs. 8, 9). Tumor cells were injected orthotopically into
athymic nude mice, and RNA from the tumors was then isolated
and sequenced. To overcome the challenge of distinguishing
between tumor-speciﬁc and stroma-speciﬁc gene expression, we
used next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in this xenograft
mouse model to separate sequencing reads based on their species
of origin (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We observed dramatic changes in stromal gene-expression
proﬁles between RKIPþ and control tumors even though the
tumors did not signiﬁcantly differ in size (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Analysis of gene-expression changes between RKIPþ and
control tumor cells using GOseq revealed that the most signiﬁcant
difference was the immune response and, speciﬁcally, macrophage chemotaxis (Q ¼ 2.2  104, Supplementary Fig. S4).
Using mouse gene sets characteristic of common immune cell
types (23), we observed a clear depletion of gene expression
associated with macrophages in the RKIPþ tumor microenvironment (Fig. 1A), and this was the most robust change observed
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Immunohistochemical staining conﬁrmed a marked reduction in the number of TAMs at the primary
tumor site in RKIPþ tumors relative to controls, both in xenograft

(BM1 and MDA-MB-436) and syngeneic (4T1.2) tumor models
(Fig. 1B and C and Supplementary Fig. S6). Moreover, the effect of
RKIP on TAMs was quite speciﬁc, as we did not observe signiﬁcant
differences in the number of B cells (CD19þ), T cells (CD3þ),
natural killer cells (CD49bþ), or neutrophils (Gr-1þ) when analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 1D).
RKIP suppresses recruitment of a distinct TAM population that
potentiates tumor cell invasion
Because RKIP regulates the number of macrophages in tumors
(Fig. 1A–C) and TAMs are known to play a signiﬁcant role in
tumor biology (11), we hypothesized that changes in TAMs may
in part explain suppression of intravasation by RKIP. In support of
this hypothesis, treating RKIPþ BM1 tumor cells with CM from a
human monocytic cell line (THP1) restored tumor cell invasion
relative to levels observed in control BM1 tumor cells (Fig. 2A).
Similar results were observed with the CM of TAMs puriﬁed from
control BM1 tumors (Fig. 2B). These ﬁndings demonstrate that
TAMs from metastatic tumors can overcome blockade of tumor
cell invasion by RKIP.

www.aacrjournals.org

It is well established that, depending on environmental conditions, TAMs can adopt phenotypes with protumor ("M2-like")
or antitumor ("M1-like") properties (13). We therefore explored
the possibility that, in addition to reducing the number of
macrophages in tumors, RKIP might also alter their functional
properties to suppress metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we
puriﬁed TAMs from BM1 tumors (metastatic) and RKIPþ BM1
tumors (nonmetastatic), which were uniformly CD45þ, CD11bþ,
F4/80þ, and CD205 (Supplementary Fig. S7), and we assessed
their functional phenotype using two interrelated approaches.
First, we determined the effect of TAM CM on tumor cell
invasion in vitro. Pretreating BM1 tumor cells with the CM of
TAMs isolated from control BM1 tumors, like THP1 cells, potentiated invasion (Fig. 2B). In sharp contrast, factors secreted by
TAMs from RKIPþ BM1 tumors had no signiﬁcant effect on tumor
cell invasiveness (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the TAMs
from metastatic and nonmetastatic (RKIPþ) tumors have distinct
phenotypes.
Second, we quantiﬁed the relative abundance of 400 proteins,
including inﬂammatory and tumorigenic factors (e.g. cytokines,

cytokine array. TAMs puriﬁed from RKIPþ BM1 tumors relative to
control BM1 tumors were distinguished by reduced abundance
of a number of prometastatic factors (11), including TGFb3,
VEGF-D, MMP-12, GDF-9, VEGF, sTNFR2, and PGRN (Fig.

RKIPþ BM1 tumors, including CD80 and TFPI, two potential
antitumor proteins (24–26). We conﬁrmed differential regulation
of Mmp12 and Grn (progranulin) transcripts in TAMs isolated
from BM1 versus RKIPþ BM1 tumors by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2E).

therefore analyzed CCL5 expression by species-speciﬁc qRT-PCR
(Fig. 3C) and by ELISA (Supplementary Fig. S8), and conﬁrmed its
downregulation in RKIPþ tumors. Similar decreases in CCL5
transcripts were observed following RKIP expression in human
MDA-MB-436 and mouse 4T1.2 tumor cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S9). Thus, RKIP suppresses CCL5 expression in multiple
human and murine tumor cell lines.
We used three approaches to investigate whether suppression
of CCL5 by RKIP plays an important role in regulating macrophage accumulation into tumors in vivo. First, because CCL5
recruits macrophages via interaction with its receptor CCR5
(20, 28), we measured Ccr5 expression in the stroma. We found
that Ccr5 levels were signiﬁcantly reduced in RKIPþ tumor stroma
by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3C). In addition, when comparing the same
number of TAMs, we observed signiﬁcant decreases in the mean
Ccr5 expression by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3D). Using ﬂow cytometry, we
determined that the decrease in mean Ccr5 was due to a reduction
in the number of CCR5þ TAMs in RKIP tumors (Fig. 3D).
Second, we transfected CCL5 into BM1 cells stably expressing
RKIP or control vector (Supplementary Figs. S8 and S10) and
observed rescue of TAM inﬁltration in tumors expressing RKIP and

4068 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

CCL5 (RKIPþCCL5) compared with those just expressing RKIP
alone (RKIPþ; Fig. 3E and F). There was a corresponding increase
in the number of CCR5þ macrophages in CCL5-rescued tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S7), consistent with CCL5 recruitment of
TAMs.
Third, we determined whether a reduction in CCL5 signaling
alone was necessary for TAM inﬁltration and tumor growth.
We treated mice with the orally bioavailable CCR5 inhibitor
Maraviroc twice daily by oral gavage and found that antagonizing the CCL5 receptor signiﬁcantly lowered the number of
TAMs recruited into BM1 control tumors as well as decreased
tumor growth (Fig. 3G; Supplementary Fig. S11). To determine
whether the number of TAMs inﬁltrating into the tumor was
simply due to a difference in tumor size, we performed a
Pearson correlation between the tumor weight and the percentage of F4/80þ cells in the tumor. We found that, whether
we examined the total population of tumors or the control and
Maraviroc-treated tumors individually, there was no correlation between the size of the tumor and the percentage of
F4/80þ cells in the tumor (Supplementary Fig. S11). Together,
these ﬁndings suggest that modulation of CCL5 expression is

one important mechanism by which RKIP controls tumor
macrophage recruitment.
Overexpression of CCL5 restores a prometastatic TAM
phenotype and overcomes metastasis suppression in RKIPþ
tumors
To determine whether CCL5 overexpression in RKIPþ BM1
tumors could also restore a TAM phenotype that promotes tumor
invasion, we ﬁrst conducted functional assays. Whereas TAMs
isolated from BM1 RKIPþ tumors had no effect on BM1 invasion;
TAMs isolated from RKIPþ BM1 tumors overexpressing CCL5induced tumor cell invasion with similar efﬁciency as TAMs
isolated from metastatic BM1 tumors (Fig. 3H). Because invasion
enables tumor cell entry into vessels, we investigated whether
overexpression of CCL5 in RKIPþ BM1 tumor cells could overcome the inhibitory effect of RKIP on intravasation. Consistent
with RKIP's ability to suppress metastasis, RKIP expression in BM1
tumor cells potently inhibited intravasation into blood vessels
(Fig. 3I; ref. 9). Importantly, elevating CCL5 expression in RKIPþ
BM1 cells produced a partial but signiﬁcant recovery of tumor cell
invasion (Supplementary Fig. S12) and intravasation into blood
vessels (Fig. 3I). CCL5 overexpression also potentiated both
invasion (Supplementary Fig. S12) and intravasation in control
metastatic tumor cells (Fig. 3I).
We then determined whether CCL5 overexpression in BM1þ
RKIP tumors could enable recruitment of TAMs that secrete
prometastatic factors. Analysis of proteins in the CM of isolated TAMs by cytokine arrays revealed robust induction of a
number of factors that were suppressed in TAMs recruited to

nonmetastatic tumors (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S13).
For example, RKIP suppressed VEGF-A, VEGF-D, OPN,
LGALS3, SLPI, MMP-12, sTNFR2, and PGRN expressions by
TAMs, and extracellular levels of these proteins were restored
or even elevated in RKIPþCCL5 tumors relative to RKIPþ
tumors (Fig. 4B). We conﬁrmed the induction of Mmp12, Slpi,
and Grn in TAMs isolated from RKIPþCCL5 tumors by qRTPCR (Fig. 4C).
The group of TAM proteins suppressed by RKIP and induced by
CCL5 included a number of potentially prometastatic factors. To
conﬁrm this possibility, we investigated whether PRGN or
sTNFR2 were sufﬁcient to drive invasion of TNBC cells in vitro.
Treating BM1 cells with 500 ng/mL recombinant sTNFR2 or
PGRN signiﬁcantly induced tumor cell invasion (Fig. 4D). These
results provide empirical evidence that prometastatic factors
counter regulated by RKIP and CCL5 directly promote the invasiveness of human breast cancer cells.
The ﬁnding that CCL5 restored the prometastatic function of
TAMs was surprising, given that it is generally believed that CCL5
acts as a chemotactic agent to recruit macrophages to tissues (20).
This observation led us to hypothesize that CCL5 might have
direct actions on TAMs to promote the expression of prometastatic factors. Treating bone marrow–derived macrophages with
CCL5 in vitro signiﬁcantly induced the expression of several
prometastatic factors, including Ccl7, Tnfr2, Mmp12, and Slpi
(Fig. 4E). Thus, overexpressing CCL5 might overcome metastasis
suppression in nonmetastatic (RKIPþ) tumors both by recruiting
TAMs and directly programming them to overexpress prometastatic factors.

datasets (top) where breast cancer MFS is signiﬁcantly stratiﬁed by classiﬁer (right). D, Kaplan–Meier plots are shown for a set of all 871 breast cancer patients.

The difference between TAMs from metastatic (BM1 or BM1
RKIPþCCL5) and nonmetastatic (RKIPþ) tumors could reﬂect a
switch from an M2 to an M1 phenotype. To examine this possibility, we analyzed proteins secreted by bone marrow–derived
macrophages (M0), M1 macrophages (activated by LPS/IFNg),
and M2 macrophages (activated by IL4) using mass spectrometry.
When we compared them with factors secreted by CCL5-recruited
TAMs, MMP12 was signiﬁcantly increased in M2 compared with
M0 and M1 macrophages; however, GRN and LGALS3 were
broadly expressed, and OPN was selectively expressed in M0
macrophages (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that the markers
expressed in the CCL5-recruited TAMs (29) are not indicative of a
classic M1 or M2 phenotype.
Collectively, these ﬁndings demonstrate that CCL5 overexpression can promote macrophage inﬁltration, macrophage function,
and intravasation on a nonmetastatic (RKIPþ) background, suggesting that downregulation of CCL5 by RKIP, and the concomitant reduction in TAMs, may be an important mechanism by
which RKIP suppresses metastasis.
Suppression of metastasis and TAMs by RKIP is coordinated
though HMGA2 signaling
Our previous work showed that RKIP suppresses breast cancer
metastasis in part by inhibiting the architectural transcription factor
high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2; refs. 8, 9). We therefore
determined whether RKIP suppresses macrophage recruitment via a
similar mechanism. HMGA2 depletion in BM1 cells led to a
signiﬁcant decrease in CCL5 expression in vitro (Fig. 5A). To test
whether HMGA2 regulates macrophage accumulation in vivo, we
crossed Hmga2/ mice with the invasive MMTV-Wnt1 genetically
engineered mouse (GEM; ref. 29). Similar to the RKIP phenotype,
Hmga2/ GEM mice (relative to Hmga2þ/þ) had decreased Ccl5

4070 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

expression in the mammary tumors (Fig. 5B), and a marked
reduction in the number of macrophages present both in the tumor
tissue as well as in the surrounding stroma (Fig. 5C). Together with
previous ﬁndings (8, 9), these results suggest that RKIP suppression
of tumor cell CCL5 expression, macrophage recruitment, and
metastasis is coordinated through HMGA2 signaling (Fig. 5D).
An RKIP macrophage gene signature predicts metastasis-free
survival
Our data suggest that an RKIP–HMGA2–CCL5 pathway regulates recruitment of a TAM population that promotes tumor
metastasis in mice. To begin to validate this pathway in humans,
we analyzed gene expression in human tumors obtained from
TNBC (n ¼ 319) and non-TNBC (n ¼ 1631) patients. When we
examined gene expression across four independent datasets from
breast cancer patients, we found that RKIP was suppressed and
HMGA2, CCL5, and CCR5 were induced in TNBC tumors relative
to non-TNBC tumors (Supplementary Fig. S14). Thus, an RKIP–
HMGA2–CCL5 pathway can be used to classify metastatic versus
nonmetastatic tumors in both mouse models and human patients.
Because TAMs secrete regulators of metastasis in mice (Fig. 4),
we examined the gene expression of these TAM-secreted proteins
in human breast cancer patients and found that SLPI, OPN,
MMP12, CCL7, TNFR2, GRN, TMEFF1, and CCL5 were all significantly increased in TNBC compared with non-TNBC patients
(Fig. 6A). Our results show that CCL5 recruits TAMs that secrete
these factors. Therefore, we performed gene set analysis as previously described (9) to identify which of these factors were consistently coexpressed with CCL5 in human TNBC tumors and
found a strong correlation between the gene-expression levels of
CCL5 with TNFR2, GRN, and CCL7 in TNBC patients in all four
datasets (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Fig. S15). These results raise the

possibility that the signaling pathway from RKIP to the three
factors secreted by TAMs (TNFR2, GRN, and CCL7) deﬁnes a set of
linked events that are prognostic for patient outcome.
To determine the clinical value of these genes, we developed a
signature using the expression levels of tumor genes regulating
TAM recruitment (RKIP, HMGA2, and CCL5) in combination with
stromal TAM-secreted genes (a TAM metagene derived from
TNFR2, GRN, and CCL7). When we examined all patients in the
datasets or those categorized as non-TNBC using molecular phenotypes as classiﬁers (30), no signiﬁcant relationship to clinical
outcome was observed (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Fig. S16). However, when we limited analyses to TNBC patients, a gene signature
based upon the combination of RKIPlow, HMGA2high, CCL5high,
and TAM-metagenehigh expression was signiﬁcantly prognostic for
poor metastasis-free survival (MFS; Fig. 6D). When considered
alone, both the tumor-based gene signature (RKIP/HMGA2/
CCL5) and the TAM genes (TNFR2, GRN, and CCL7) were poor
prognostic indicators for breast cancer outcome. Only the gene
signature based on the combined tumor and TAM regulatory
modules was signiﬁcant across four independent sets of TNBC
patients (Fig 6C). These results highlight the importance of
tumor–stromal crosstalk in the metastatic progression of TNBCs.

Discussion
In this study, we identiﬁed a novel mechanism whereby RKIP
regulates tumor invasiveness by inhibiting inﬁltration of a subset
of TAMs that secrete prometastatic factors. We showed that TAMs
recruited to metastatic RKIP tumors, relative to nonmetastatic
RKIPþ tumors, had reduced ability to drive tumor invasion and
decreased secretion of numerous prometastatic factors. We demonstrated that RKIP inhibits TAM recruitment by reducing CCL5
expression. CCL5 overexpression was sufﬁcient to rescue recruitment of prometastatic TAMs and tumor cell intravasation on a
nonmetastatic RKIPþ background, and CCL5 inhibition reduced
TAM inﬁltration. Interestingly, a gene signature based on the RKIP
regulatory pathway combined with prometastatic TAM factors
regulated by RKIP was prognostic for MFS of TNBC patients. Thus,
suppression of RKIP, through direct effects in tumor cells and
indirect on TAM recruitment in the microenvironment, may
partially explain the aggressive tumors observed in TNBC patients
(Fig. 7).

Our demonstration that RKIP expression in tumors markedly
attenuates inﬁltration of prometastatic TAMs suggests that metastasis suppressors play a more extensive role in regulating the
tumor microenvironment than previously realized. TAMs are
known to promote metastatic progression through secretion of
growth factors, MMPs, and suppression of the immune system
(11). Our protein array analysis of secreted factors suppressed in
TAMs from RKIPþ tumors and restored in TAMs from RKIPþCCL5
tumors revealed similar categories, including angiogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, growth factor activity, immune system development, and regulation of locomotion (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2; ref. 31). Thus, one important mechanism by
which RKIP suppresses metastasis is by reducing the number and
prometastatic phenotype of TAMs.
On a molecular level, RKIP regulates TAM recruitment, in part,
by attenuating CCL5 expression. Although the CCL5–CCR5 axis
has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis, the role of
macrophages in this process and the molecular and cellular
mechanisms of action have been controversial (20, 27, 28). Our
study shows that paracrine CCL5 signaling recruits TAMs and
perhaps directly programs their prometastatic function. This
process is further promoted by an autocrine loop leading to CCL5
expression in the TAMs themselves. Expression of CCL5 and the
presence of CCL5-recruited TAMs are insufﬁcient by themselves to
predict outcome, consistent with the fact that CCL5 cannot
completely rescue the TAM phenotype. However, the combination of the RKIP tumor signaling pathway with the CCL5-TAMs
enables generation of a prognostic gene signature for TNBC
patients. This result highlights the crosstalk between tumor cells
and TAMs (Fig. 7) and suggests that taking into account both
tumor and stromal factors may be effective for prognosis and
therapeutic efﬁcacy in TNBC patients.
Consistent with this hypothesis, previous work has shown that
shed TNFR2 (sTNFR2) protein is higher in the plasma of pancreatic, endometrial, and breast cancer patients (32–34) and is
associated with an increased risk of cancer (34). Progranulin
(PGRN) expression blocks TNFR2-mediated inﬂammation and
has been shown to drive migration, invasion, and VEGF expression in breast cancer (35, 36). PGRN is highly expressed in a
number of tumors, including breast, and has also been targeted
using biologics in hepatocellular carcinoma (37, 38). Moreover,
we provide direct evidence that PGRN and sTNFR2 can promote
the invasiveness of human TNBC tumor cells in vitro. Because of
the strong evidence of proinvasive action and the clinical relevance of these factors, CCL5, PGRN, and sTNFR2 are all potential
targets for anti-TNBC drug treatment.
Although our studies revealed a role for RKIP in macrophage
recruitment to tumors in both xenograft and syngeneic mouse
models, other metastasis suppressors might have unique roles in
regulating additional cell types in the stroma. Furthermore, we
identiﬁed factors secreted by prometastatic TAMs in this study
using immune-compromised nude mice that lack mature T cells.
It is possible that, in TNBC patients, RKIP might also play a role in
regulating T cells through factors such as CD80 (upregulated
in RKIPþ BM1-derived TAMs) and is a potential therapeutic tool
in the treatment of breast cancer patients (25).
Understanding how the tumor cells and TAMs interact could
lead to novel strategies for blocking TAM recruitment to TNBCs
and tumor metastatic progression. In the case of CCL5-recruited
TAMs, there is an array of prometastatic genes that support the
tumor. Elegant work on TAMs in breast cancer by Qian and

colleagues (19) has implicated CCL2 and GM-CSF in TAM
recruitment in breast cancer. However, the models used to
study CCL2 are largely based on the luminal/HER2þ MMTVPyVT GEM model and are likely to display a unique set of
molecular interactions. In the present study, no inhibition of
CCL2 or GM- CSF expression by RKIP was observed by RNAseq
analysis. Instead, we show that expression of a metastasis
suppressor in tumor cells regulates recruitment of a CCL5responsive TAM population secreting pro-metastatic factors.
Future studies will be necessary to determine which inhibitors
of these pathways will be most effective therapeutically either
alone or in combination in TNBC.
