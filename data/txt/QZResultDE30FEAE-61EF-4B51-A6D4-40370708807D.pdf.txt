ABSTRACT
Stratification of oestrogen receptor (ER) negative and triple negative breast
cancers (TNBCs) is urgently needed. In the current study, a cohort of 880 ER- (including
635 TNBCs) was immuno-profiled for a panel of DNA repair proteins including: Pol β,
FEN1, APE1, XRCC1, SMUG1, PARP1, BRCA1, ATR, ATM, DNA-PKcs, Chk1, Chk2, p53,
and TOPO2. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models (with backward stepwise
exclusion of these factors, using a criterion of p < 0.05 for retention of factors in
the model) were used to identify factors that were independently associated with
clinical outcomes. XRCC1 (p = 0.002), pol β (p = 0.032) FEN1 (p = 0.001) and BRCA1
(p = 0.040) levels were independently associated with poor BCSS. Subsequently,
DNA repair index prognostic (DRPI) scores for breast cancer specific survival (BCSS)
were calculated and two prognostic groups (DRPI-PGs) were identified. Patients in
prognostic group 2 (DRPI-PG2) have higher risk of death (p < 0.001). Furthermore,
in DRPI-PG2 patients, exposure to anthracycline reduced the risk of death [(HR (95%
CI) = 0.79 (0.64–0.98), p = 0.032) by 21–26%. In addition, DRPI-PG2 patients have
adverse clinicopathological features including higher grade, lympho-vascular invasion,
Her-2 positive phenotype, compared to those in DRPI-PG1 (p < 0.01). Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated that the DRPI outperformed the
currently used prognostic factors and adding DRPI to lymph node stage significantly
improved their performance as a predictor for BCSS [p < 0.00001, area under curve
(AUC) = 0.70]. BER strongly influences pathogenesis of ER- and TNBCs. The DRPI
accurately predicts BCSS and can also serve as a valuable prognostic and predictive
tool for TNBCs.

limited [4] and remains a significant clinical challenge,
hindered by the inability of these tumours to respond
to traditional hormone therapies and targeted agents.
Research efforts are urgently needed to discover specific
prognostic and predictive molecular signatures that
can guide individualized therapy for this BC subgroup
[5]. Although recently published gene expression data

INTRODUCTION
About 15%–20% of breast cancers (BC) are triple
negative BC (TNBC) subtype which is characterized by
aggressive phenotype with rapid proliferation, invasion,
metastasis and poor survival [1–3]. Treatment strategies
for patients with ER negative (ER-) and TNBC are

revealed that TNBC is largely heterogeneous, impaired
DNA repair machinery is a common feature of different
TNBC molecular subtypes [6, 7]. Moreover, recent studies
suggest that the clinical outcome and response to current
standard chemotherapy in ER-BCs, especially TNBC,
are particularly influenced by the integrity of DNA repair
pathways [7]. The higher rate of response to a given
chemotherapy could probably result from an accumulation
of DNA damage, abnormal mitoses and subsequent mitotic
catastrophe [5].
Given the complex network of DNA repair
machinery, we speculated that in ER- and TNBCs
deregulation of multiple DNA damage signalling and
DNA repair pathways could have a significant impact
on prognosis and response to therapy. To address this
hypothesis, we immunohistochemically-profiled a panel of
key factors involved in DNA-damage signalling network
(ATR, ATM, pChk1, Chk2, p53), double strand break
repair (BRCA1, DNA-PKcs, TOPO2) and base excision
repair (pol β, FEN1, APE1, XRCC1, SMUG1, PARP1) in
a large cohort of 880 ER-breast cancers (including 635
TNBCs) with long term follow-up data. We demonstrated
that BER (XRCC1, polβ and FEN1) independently
influenced clinical outcome along with BRCA1. A DNA
repair prognostic index incorporating XRCC1, polβ, FEN1
and BRCA1 stratified patients into two distinct prognostic
groups. The primary potential clinical significance of
our results is the ability to identify those patients with
ER- or TNBC who are likely to benefit from the standard
adjuvant anthracycline chemotherapy, and spare other
patients whose response would be poor from enduring the
unnecessary serious cytotoxic side-effects.

size, lymph-vascular invasion and lymph node status.
By using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models
with backward stepwise exclusion, XRCC1 (p = 0.002),
FEN1 (p = 0.001), pol β (p = 0.032), BRCA1 (p = 0.040)
and tumour stage (p < 0.0001) remained significant
independent predictors for BCSS after controlling for
adjuvant chemotherapy (Table 1). None of the covariates
exhibited significant deviations from the proportionality
assumption or had time-dependent effects)

Development of DNA repair prognostic index
(DRPI) for BCSS
Subsequently, the summations of β coefficient
values of XRCC1, FEN1, pol β and BRCA1 in the final
Cox model were used to calculate the DRPI for each
patient as follows:
DRPI score = XRCC1 (high; −0.214, low; 0) +
FEN1 (high; 0.391, low; 0) + polβ (high; −0.226, low; 0) +
BRCA1 (high; −0.473, low; 0)

DRPI stratifies patients into two distinct
prognostic groups (DRPI-PGs)
Based on the cut-off point selected at the quantile of
DRPI score that maximized the profile log-likelihood of
the model, two DRPI-PGs were identified. DRPI-PG1 was
defined as tumours with DRPI score ranging from −0.31 to
−0.91 while DRPI-PG2 was defined as tumours with DRPI
score ranging from 0.39 to −0.30.
As shown in Figure 1A, patients belonging to
DRPI -PG2 have poor BCSS compared to DRPI-PG1
(p = 0.004). In tumours with lymph node positivity, DRPIPG2 remains associated with poor survival compared
DRPI–PG1 (Figure 1B) (p = 0.023). Interestingly, even
in lymph node negative tumours, DRPI-PG2 remains
associated with poor survival compared to DRPI-PG1
(Figure 1C) (p = 0.046). In tumours that did not receive
any chemotherapy or that received ineffective CMF
chemotherapy, DRPI-PG2 remained associated with
poor survival compared to DRPI-PG1 (Figure 1D, 1E)
(ps = 0.015 and 0.004, respectively). In patients who
received adjuvant anthracycline chemotherapy, tumours
with DRPI-PG1 had a clinical outcome similar to those

(p  =  0.25, Figure 2F). For patients with DRPI-PG2
exposure to anthracycline reduced the risk of death from
TNBC (HR (95% CI) = 0.74 (0.57–0.95), p = 0.0017) by
26% (Figure 3B) while, no benefit was demonstrated with
anthracycline in DRPI-PG1 (Figure 3A); the interaction
was statistically significant with p = 0.001.
To examine the prognostic performance of the
DRPI score compared with other prognostic factors
such lymph node stage, Cox proportional hazards
multivariable analysis after controlling for adjuvant
chemotherapy was performed and receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. DRPI
score and LN stages were the only independent
prognostic factors for ER-BC (ps < 0.001). Furthermore
as shown in Figures 4A1 and 4A2, the ROC curves
demonstrate that the AUC for lymph node stage and
DRPI are similar (AUCs 0.64 and 0.62 respectively);
however, adding DRPI to LN stage improved

was demonstrated from prescribing an anthracycline in
DRPI-PG1 (Figure 2A), whereas for DRPI-PG2, exposure
to an anthracycline reduced the risk of death from BC by
21–26% [(HR (95% CI) = 0.79 (0.64–0.98), p = 0.032)
(Figure 2B); the interaction was statistically significant

Integrated prognostic index (IPI) and
IPI-PGs accurately predicts clinical outcome
after adjuvant chemotherapy

DRPI-PGs and clinicopathological associations
As shown in Table 2, tumours in DRPI-PG2 were
associated with adverse clinicopathological features
including higher histologic grade (p = 0.045), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.001), and Her-2 overexpression
(p = 0.046). Furthermore, DRPI-PG2 was more likely to
have low levels of other DNA repair proteins including:
PARP1 (p = 0.002), ATM level (p = 0.018), nuclear
pChk1 (p = 0.001), Chk2 level (p < 0.001), and APE1
levels (p < 0.001). Interestingly, DRPI-PG1 tumours were
more likely to be associated with basal-like phenotype
(p = 0.024), high proliferation markers such as Ki67
(p = 0.032) and Top2A overexpression (p = 0.004) and
epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers such as CK5/6

To generate a continuous integrated prognostic
index score (IPI; range = 3.39–0.09) for ER-BC the
LN stage score (1–3) has been added to DRPI as
described in the methods section. Subsequently, two
IPI-PGs were identified; IPI-PG1 = 3.39 to 1.09 and
IPI-PG2 = 1.0 to 0.09.
In ER- negative tumours, BCSS was
significantly  poorer in IPI-PG2 compared to IPI-PG1
(p  < 0.001) (Figure  4B). In patients who received
no chemotherapy (Figure 4B) and ineffective CMF
chemotherapy (Figure  4C), IPI-PG2 group have poor
survival compared to IPI-PG1 group (p = 0.001 and

p = 0.004 respectively). Similarly, in patients who
received anthracycline chemotherapy, IPI-PG2 have
poor survival compared to IPI-PG1 group (p < 0.001)
(Figure  5A). Furthermore, for patients with IPI-PG1
exposure to anthracycline reduced the risk of death
from BC (HR (95% CI) = 0.38 (0.20–0.73), p = 0.004)
by 62% (Figure 5B), whereas for IPI sub-group 2, there
was no effect (Figure 5C), the interaction was statistically
significant at p = 0.007.
Generally in TNBCs, BCSS was significantly
poorer in IPI-PG2 compared to IPI-1 group (p < 0.0001)
(Figure 5D). In TNBCs, patients who did not receive
(p  < 0.001; Figure 5E) or those received either CMF
(p  =  0.005; Figures 5E) or anthracycline (p < 0.001;
Figure 6A) chemotherapies, BCSS was significantly
poorer in IPI-PG2 group compared to IPI-PG1. However
within IPI PG1 of TNBC, patients treated with either
CMF or anthracycline had longer survival (p = 0.004) as
compared to those who did not receive any chemotherapy.

In TNBC patients with IPI-PG1 exposure to either CMF
or anthracycline reduced the risk of death by 64% (HR
(95% CI) = 0.36 (0.15–0.85), p = 0.019) and 65% (HR
(95% CI) = 0.35 (0.170–0.713), p = 0.004), respectively
(Figure 6B); the interaction was statistically significant
with p = 0.001. No benefit was demonstrated for either
CMF or anthracycline in IPI-PG2 (Figure 6C).
Taken together, the data provides compelling
evidence that incorporation of DNA repair expression to
lymph node status significantly improves prognostication
and prediction of ER- and TNBC patients.

DISCUSSION
This is a comprehensive immunohistochemical
evaluation of the key DNA repair proteins in a large
cohort of ER- and TNBC patients. We provide evidence
that XRCC1, polβ and FEN1 independently impact

outcomes and are superior to BRCA1 in prognosticating
ER- or TNBC patients. The data presented here supports
recent pre-clinical observations that implicate a cross talk
between BER and BRCA1. BRCA1 has been shown to
transcriptionally regulate the expression of BER factors
such as OGG1, NTH1 and APE1 [8, 9]. Similarly in a
recent study we consistently observed low expression of
XRCC1 and polβ in BRCA1 deficient cell lines compared
to BRCA1 proficient cell lines [10] implying a potential
role for BRCA1 in regulating BER.
TNBC is characterized biologically by having
a histopathological similarity with germline BRCA1mutated breast cancer (BRCA-ness phenotype) [11–14]
with 90% of BRCA1-mutation tumors being considered
as TNBC [15]. Our study suggests that dysfunctional
BRCA1 in TNBC could lead to impaired BER expression
which in turn may promote aggressive clinical behaviours
[16]. We speculate that increased genomic instability in
BRCA1 deficient/BER impaired cells could promote a
‘mutator phenotype’ resulting in accelerated mutagenesis
and aggressive biology [16]. In addition, recent studies
implicate a role for BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation of
nucleotide excision repair (NER) [17] and a role in NHEJ.
BRCA1 is also well known to interact with DNA-damage
signalling protein such as the ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1
pathway that link DNA damage to repair, cell cycle
progression and apoptosis [18–23]. In the current study, in
both ER- and TNBC patients who either did not receive or
received ineffective CMF based chemotherapy; survival
was poor in the DRPI-PG2. Whereas patients in DRPIPG2 who are more likely to have impairment of BER and
DSB mediated DNA repair machinery exhibit  relative
sensitivity to anthracycline chemotherapy in ER-BC
and TNBC as evidenced by improved survival in this
group. Anthracycline chemotherapy induces oxidative
base damage through free radical generation, which if
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

unrepaired, could lead to the accumulation of DNA double
strand breaks.
The main potential clinical significance of our
results is the ability to identify patients with TNBC who
are likely to benefit from the standard anthracycline
chemotherapy, and spare patients whose response would
be poor from enduring the unnecessary serious cytotoxic
side effects. However, identification of patients who are
unlikely to benefit from anthracycline chemotherapy on
the bases of evaluation of DNA repair signature in the
TNBC tumours either before initiation of Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy- or shortly after surgery and before starting
the additional adjuvant chemotherapy may have even a
greater importance. Due to its deficiency of DNA repair
mechanisms, BRCA1 mutation-associated TNBC cells
are particularly sensitive to methyl methane sulfonate
(alkylating agent) [24] and to DNA-damaging platinum
agents, like cisplatin or carboplatin [25]. Recently, a
phase II study evaluated cisplatin monotherapy as a
neoadjuvant therapy in TNBC patients, showing a pCR
rate of 22% [26]. For breast cancer patients with BRCA1
mutation, single-agent cisplatin neoadjuvant therapy can
achieve an extremely high pCR rate of 83% [27]. Several
phase II single-arm studies have tested the combination
of taxane and platinum salts as neoadjuvant therapy for
TNBC patients, with pCR rates of 33–77%, indicating that
platinum salts are especially active in TNBC treatment
[25] . Also BRCA1 mutated and basal-like breast cancer
cells were found to be sensitive to oxidative DNA damage
induced by H2O2 treatment [28]. The increased sensitivity
was associated with defective BER as assessed by cell
based BER assay in BRCA1 deficient cells [28]. Taken
together, the data provides evidence that the DRPI is a
promising predictive factor in ER- and TNBC patients.
In contrast to ER+ and HER-2 positive breast
cancers, there is currently a lack of robust prognostic
21973

and predictive factors in ER- and TNBCs [1, 2]. Apart
from lymph node stage [4], there is as yet no clinically
validated biomarker in ER- and TNBCs. An important
observation in the current study is that addition of DRPI
appears to improve prognostic significance of lymph node
stage as demonstrated by ROC analysis. To validate this
further we combined DRPI scores and lymph node stage
and generated an integrated prognostic index (IPI). As
expected the IPI was robust in prognosticating as well as
predicting outcomes in ER- and TNBC patients. To a large
extent the data presented here is hypothesis generating and
prospective validation will be required to translate our
novel observations for patient benefit.
Gene expression profiling data suggest that TNBCs
exhibit considerable heterogeneity [14]. Although genetic
phenotypes provide biological insights, their clinical
impact is uncertain. Therefore, a semi-quantitative
immunohistochemical approach remains a clinically
viable strategy. In this context our study complements the
BRCAness phenotype described previously in TNBCs
[13]. The promising synthetic lethality approach targeting
the BRCAness phenotype in TNBCs with PARP inhibitors
[17] suggest that additional DNA repair targets would also
be suitable for personalized approaches. Interestingly, in
preclinical models we have recently shown that BRCA1/
BER deficient breast cancer cells are sensitive to treatment
with ATM and DNA-PKcs treatment either alone or in
combination with cisplatin chemotherapy [10] suggesting
additional approaches besides PARP inhibitors for
personalized strategy.
In conclusion we have shown that an
immunohistochemical based DNA repair prognostic index
could be utilized for stratification of clinical outcome in
ER- and TNBC patients and can also serve as a valuable
predictive tool for TNBCs. BER strongly influences
pathogenesis of ER- and TNBCs.

axillary clearance for node positive or sampling for node
negative) with radiotherapy. Prior to 1989, patients did
not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Since 1989, adjuvant
therapy was scheduled on the basis of the Nottingham
Prognostic Index (NPI), ER-α and  menopausal
status [5]. Patients with NPI scores < 3.4 (low risk) did
not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Pre-menopausal
patients with NPI scores ≥ 3.4 (high risk) were
recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. No
adjuvant chemotherapy was prescribed to 503 cases,
either because the patient declined the treatment; ACT
was not the standard of care at that time; or due to the
fact that patients were considered to be of low risk
[(NPI) ≤ 3.4]. High risk (NPI > 3.4) patients (n = 351)
received adjuvant chemotherapy; 149 patients (treated
before 2000) received CMF, (cyclophosphamide,
methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil), whereas 202 patients
(treated after 2000) received anthracycline-combination
adjuvant chemotherapy (Supplementary Table S1) [5].
503 cases did not receive any chemotherapy, either
because the patient declined systemic treatment,
adjuvant chemotherapy was not the standard of care
at that time, or patients were of low risk [Nottingham
Prognostic  Index (NPI) ≤ 3.4]. All patients were
consented as per hospital Standard of Care. The study
was approved by Nottingham Ethics Committee
(C202313) and the Hospital Research and Innovations
Department.

Tissue microarray (TMA) and
immunohistochemistry (IHC)
The TMAs were constructed and immunohistochemically profiled for pol β, FEN1, APE1, XRCC1,
SMUG1, PARP1, ATR, ATM, Chk1, Chk2, p53, BRCA1,
DNA-PKcs and TOPO2 (Supplementary Table S2). We
have reported the specificity of the ­antibodies used
here in recent previous publications [5, 23, 29–35].
Expression of HER2, ER and PR was re-assessed
­
­according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology/­
College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines [36, 37]. For ER status, the EP1 clone has been used
(Dako-­Cytomation). ER and PR assays were considered
negative if there were < 1% positive tumour ­nuclei in
the presence of the expected reactivity of internal and
­external controls.
Tumour cores were evaluated by two pathologists
(co-authors: TAF, IOE) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics of patients in two different
settings. Whole field inspection of the core was scored
and intensities of nuclear staining were grouped as
follows: 0 = no staining, 1 = weak staining, 2 = moderate
staining, 3 = strong staining. The percentage of each
category was estimated (0–100%). H-score (range 0–300)

PATIENTS AND METHODS
We retrospectively identified 880 consecutive
patients with ER negative early primary invasive
BC who were diagnosed and treated in Nottingham
University Hospitals, UK, between 1986 and 2010
and whose tissues were suitable for the analysis
of a panel of key DNA repair proteins expression
by immunohistochemistry. Patient demographics
are summarized in additional file 1 (Supplementary
Table  S1). These patients were all female and their
median age was 51 years (range 28–71 years). Their
median follow-up was 107 months (range 2–243
months). Of these patients, 635 (72%) had triple
negative phenotype (ER-, PR- and HER2-) and 185
(22%) were HER2 positive. Patients received standard
breast surgery (mastectomy or wide local excision, and

Predictive accuracy of DNA repair prognostic
index compared with other prognostic
clinicopathological factors

was calculated by multiplying intensity of staining and
percentage staining. H-score cut-offs for individual marker
is summarized in Supplementary Table S2. Not all cores
within the TMA were suitable for IHC analysis as some
cores were missing or lacked tumour. Intra- (kappa > 0.8;
Cohen kappa test) and inter- (kappa > 0.8; using multirater kappa tests) observer agreements were excellent. In
cases where discordant results were obtained, the slides
were re-evaluated by both pathologists together and a
consensus was reached.
To validate the use of TMAs for immunophenotyping, full-face sections of 40 cases were stained
and protein expression levels were compared. The
concordance between TMAs and full-face sections was
excellent (k = 0.8). Positive and negative (by omission of
the primary antibody and IgG-matched serum) controls
were included in each run.

To evaluate whether the DRPI adds new
independent prognostic information to the lymph node
stage, we performed separate Kaplan-Meier analyses by
DRPI-PG within each LN stage stratum. The significance
of the additional stratification provided by the DNA repair
prognostic index was evaluated based on the log-rank test.

Development and calculation of integrative
prognostic index (IPI) score for ER negative BC
The LN stage score (1–3) has been added to DRPI
scores to get an IPI continuous score (range = 3.39–0.09)
and two IPI prognostic groups (IPI-PGs) were identified;
IPI-PG1 = 3.39 to 1.09 and IPI-PG2 = 1.0 to 0.09. The
thresholds to define the two IPI-PGs were selected by
using a multivariate Cox regression model including the
clinical and demographic covariates and a dichotomous
IPI score. The optimal cut-off point was selected as the
quantile of the IPI score that maximized the profile loglikelihood of the model.

Calculation of DNA repair prognostic
index scores
After definition of factors that were associated with
BCSS in univariate analysis, multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models (with backward stepwise exclusion of
these factors, using a criterion of p < 0.05 for retention
of factors in the model) were used to identify factors that
were independently associated with clinical outcomes. The
statistical significance of the model was assessed based
on the likelihood ratio test. The proportional hazards
assumption was tested using both standard log-log plots
and by generating Kaplan–Meier survival estimate curves,
and observing that the curves did not intersect with each
other. Hazard ratios (HRs) for death risks and relapse
and 95% confidence intervals were calculated from the
Cox proportional hazards analysis. Subsequently, DNA
repair index prognostic (DRPI) scores for BCSS were
calculated using the summations of β-coefficient values of
the factors retained in the final model after controlling for
chemotherapies and lymph node stage.

Clinical impact of DNA repair prognostic index
and model discrimination
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
were generated to compare the different prognostic models
with and without inclusion of DRPI score [38]. Logistic fit
of low vs. high survival category by cumulative hazard (the
product of the hazard ratios of each incorporated variable)
was performed. Area under the curve (AUC) value was
calculated from the ROC curves. An AUC of 0.6 or above
was considered a fair classifier. Model discrimination
was evaluated based on Harrell’s concordance index, or
c index, which is a generalized area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) for censored observations and
is equal to the probability of concordance between the
predicted probability of relapse and the relapse outcomes.
The concordance index was adjusted for bias using
bootstrap resampling with 300 replications. The CI for
the c index was obtained based on approximate normality
using the variance estimate of the unadjusted index.

Determination of DNA repair prognostic
index cut-offs
While DRPI score is a continuous risk, to evaluate
its efficiency as a prognostic tool we defined subgroups
associated with a prognostic outcome using specific
cut-offs. We determined thresholds to define two DNA
repair prognostic groups (DRPI-PGs) with distinct
prognosis. To determine the cut-off point, a multivariate
Cox regression model was used that included the clinical
and demographic covariates and a dichotomous DRPI
score based on cut-off points selected between the 5%
and the 95% quantiles of the DNA repair prognostic index
score distribution. The optimal cut-off point was selected
as the quantile that maximized the profile log-likelihood
of this model.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using
STATISTICA (Stat Soft Ltd, Tulsa, USA) and SPSS
(version 17, Chicago, USA). Where appropriate, Pearson’s
chi-squared; student’s t-test and ANOVA tests were used.
All tests were two-sided with a 95% confidence interval
(CI) and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered to
be indicative of statistical significance. Survival data
including survival time, disease-free survival (DFS),

and development of loco-regional and distant metastases
(DM) were maintained on a prospective basis. BC specific
survival (BCSS) was defined as the number of months
from diagnosis to the occurrence BC-related death.
DFS was defined as the number of months from time of
surgery to the occurrence of recurrence or DM relapse.
Survival was censored if the patient was still alive, lost to
follow-up, or died from other causes. Cumulative survival
probabilities and 5-year BCSS and DFS were estimated
using the univariate Cox models and the Kaplan–Meier
plot method where appropriate, and differences between
survival rates were tested for significance using the logrank test. A stringent p value < 0.01 was considered to
indicate statistical significance for multiple comparisons.
Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK) criteria,
recommended by McShane et al [39], were followed
