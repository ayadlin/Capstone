Abstract
Recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) analogs [erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA)] are clinically used
to treat anemia in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. After clinical trials reporting increased
adverse events and/or reduced survival in ESA-treated patients, concerns have been raised about the
potential role of ESAs in promoting tumor progression, possibly through tumor cell stimulation. However,
evidence is lacking on the ability of EPO to directly affect cancer stem–like cells, which are thought to be
responsible for tumor progression and relapse. We found that breast cancer stem–like cells (BCSC) isolated
from patient tumors express the EPO receptor and respond to EPO treatment with increased proliferation
and self-renewal. Importantly, EPO stimulation increased BCSC resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and
activated cellular pathways responsible for survival and drug resistance. Speciﬁcally, the Akt and ERK
pathways were activated in BCSC at early time points following EPO treatment, whereas Bcl-xL levels
increased at later times. In vivo, EPO administration counteracted the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on
BCSC-derived orthotopic tumor xenografts and promoted metastatic progression both in the presence and
in the absence of chemotherapy treatment. Altogether, these results indicate that EPO acts directly on BCSC
by activating speciﬁc survival pathways, resulting in BCSC protection from chemotherapy and enhanced
tumor progression. Cancer Res; 73(21); 6393–400. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) have been used for
two decades in the supportive therapy of patients with cancer,
due to their ability to increase red blood cell production and to
reduce the need of transfusions (1). In 2002, ESAs were administered to approximately 45% of all patients with cancer (2).
However, following clinical trials reporting a shorter progression-free survival and/or overall survival in ESA-treated
patients, ESAs were suspected to increase the risks of thromboembolic events and to enhance tumor progression (3–6).
Consequently, in 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) limited the indication for ESA administration to patients
with cancer with hemoglobin levels of less than 10 g/dL
receiving chemotherapy for palliative intent (7). Since then,
the use of ESAs in patients with cancer declined progressively,

and recently the FDA released new guidelines ensuring that
ESAs' access is strictly controlled and that patients are fully
informed about ESA-related risks (8). Despite clinical observations suggesting a possible association between ESAs and
tumor progression, the effect of erythropoietin (EPO) on
neoplastic cells remains a matter of debate. In particular,
experimental studies on the effect of EPO on cancer cells
yielded controversial results, likely due to variable methodologic approaches. Recent in vivo studies, however, provided
important clues on tumors' response to EPO. Speciﬁcally, EPO
was shown to antagonize the effect of trastuzumab on breast
cancer xenografts and to decrease the effect of chemotherapy
in a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer (9, 10). Such
studies suggest a direct inﬂuence of EPO on breast tumors and
highlight the importance of reliable in vivo models to elucidate
the interactions between EPO and tumor cells. The existence of
cancer stem cells (CSC) in solid tumors was shown for the ﬁrst
time in breast cancer, in which CSCs were isolated as a CD44þ/
CD24/low population able to initiate tumors with as few as 200
cells (11). Lately, breast tumorigenic cells were identiﬁed either
by distinctive phenotypes such as ALDHþ, CD24high/CD49fhigh/
delta-like 1 (DLL1)high, CD24high/CD49fhigh/Delta-notch like
EGF repeat-containing transmembrane (DNER)high, or
through functional characteristics such as enhanced PKH26
dye-retaining capacity or low proteasome activity (reviewed
in ref. 12). More recently, breast CSCs (BCSC) were identiﬁed
as a ganglioside GD2þ population able to form tumors with
as few as 10 cells (13). BCSCs have been shown to increase
after chemotherapy treatment (14) and to be quantitatively

associated with chemotherapy resistance (15). Moreover,
BCSCs have been shown to mediate invasion and metastasis
both in vitro and in mouse models (16). Elucidating the
effect of EPO on BCSC is therefore crucial to fully understand the effects of ESAs treatment in patients with breast
cancer. As ESAs administration is reserved to patients with
metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, it is particularly important to understand whether they may inﬂuence BCSC response to anticancer drugs and metastasis
progression. Here, we used human BCSC-derived orthotopic/metastatic xenografts to show that BCSC response to
EPO in vivo results in increased chemotherapy resistance
of primary tumors and metastases, resulting in enhanced
tumor progression.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and reagents
Primary antibodies were: mouse monoclonal anti-EPOR
MAB307 (R&D Systems; ref. 10), rabbit polyclonal anti-EPOR
M20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; ref. 9), rabbit polyclonal antiAkt and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt Ser 473 (9272 and
9271; Cell Signaling Technology), mouse monoclonal antiphospho Erk1/2 Tyr 204 (E4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit
polyclonal anti-Erk1 (K23; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse
monoclonal anti-Bcl-xL (H-5; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
mouse monoclonal anti-b-actin (JLA20; Calbiochem), mouse
monoclonal anti-CD44 (BU75; Ancell), mouse monoclonal
anti-CD24 (HIS50; BD Biosciences), mouse monoclonal antip63 (4A4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal
CK8-18 (5D3), mouse monoclonal CK14 (LL002), and mouse
monoclonal CK5 (XM26; all from Novocastra), mouse monoclonal anti-Ki67 (MIB-1; Dako), mouse monoclonal anti-CD49f
(MP4F10; R&D Systems). Secondary antibodies were: horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse antibody
(Pierce), HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Scientiﬁc), mouse ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and Rhodamine red–conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen, Molecular
Probes), and mouse R-phycoerythrin (PE) antibody (SigmaAldrich). Recombinant human EPO was purchased from R&D
Systems.
BCSC isolation and culture
Human breast cancer tissues were obtained from patients
undergoing surgery in accordance with the ethical standards
of the institutional Committee on human experimentation
(authorization no. CE-ISS 09/282). Tumor tissues were
mechanically and enzymatically digested with collagenase
(1.5 mg/mL; Gibco) and hyaluronidase (20 mg/mL; SigmaAldrich) in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (Gibco),
shaking for 1 hour at 37 C. The resulting cell suspension
was plated in ultra-low attachment ﬂasks (Corning) in
serum-free medium supplemented with basic ﬁbroblast
growth factor (bFGF; 10 ng/mL) and EGF (20 ng/mL) as
previously described (17). This procedure yielded BCSC lines
that were subjected to genotyping to validate each cell line
individuality and were further tested for their ability to
generate tumor xenografts that replicated the histology of
the parental tumor.

Viability, proliferation, and clonogenic assays
For viability assays, BCSCs untreated or pretreated 24 hours
with 3 U/mL EPO were cultured for the indicated times in
presence of doxorubicin (1 mmol/L), 5-FU (5-ﬂuorouracil; 25
mmol/L), or Taxol (5 mmol/L). The number of viable cells was
detected by the CellTiter AQueous Assay Kit (Promega). Cell
death was also assessed by acridine orange (50 mg/mL)/ethidium bromide (1 mg/mL) staining and ﬂuorescence microscopy detection. Colony-forming assays were conducted on soft
agar (Seaplaque) with 0.4% base agar and 0.3% top-layer agar.
After 21 days, colonies were stained with 0.01% crystal violet
and visualized under a light microscope.
Immunoblotting
Cells were growth factor–starved for 24 hours and treated
with 3 U/mL EPO for 10, 30, 120 minutes and 48 hours.
Protein extracts were obtained in ice-cold T-PER buffer
(Thermo Scientiﬁc) with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich).
Equal amounts of proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, subsequently
blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween
20 and probed with primary and HRP-linked secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura Substrate (Pierce). Image acquisition was
conducted with a ChemiDoc Imaging system (UVP Advanced
Imaging Systems).
Immunohistochemistry
Apoptotic cells on parafﬁn-embedded breast cancer xenograft sections were visualized by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) reaction with the In Situ AP Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche).
Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted on 5 mm-thick
parafﬁn-embedded sections of breast cancer tissue and xenografts. Tissues were heated for antigen retrieval and stained
with speciﬁc antibodies against Bcl-xL, CK 8-18, CK 14, CK 5,
p63, Ki67, EPO receptor (EPOR), or isotype-matched controls
overnight at 4 C. Sections were incubated with biotinylated
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins and subjected to
streptavidin-peroxidase (Dako). Stainings were revealed using
3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate (AEC; Dako) substrate and
cells counterstained with aqueous hematoxylin. Slides were
mounted with synthetic resin.
Immunoﬂuorescence and ﬂow cytometry
Immunoﬂuorescence was conducted on cytospins of cultured BCSC ﬁxed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes
at 37 C, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30
minutes and exposed overnight at 4 C to antibodies against
EPOR, CD44, and CD24. Stained slides were treated with
Rhodamine Red- or FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies
with the addition of 200 ng/mL RNAse (Sigma-Aldrich).
Nuclei were counterstained with TOTO-3 iodide (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) and images were acquired using an
Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. For ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) staining, BCSC were ﬁxed with
2% paraformaldehyde and stained with primary antibodies
against CD44, CD24, EPOR, or isotype-matched controls and

Samples were analyzed with a FACSCalibur equipped with
CellQuest Software (BD Biosciences).
Mice treatment
Animal studies were carried out according to the institutional guidelines under the Italian Ministry of Health
authorization (DM 23/2011-B). BCSCs (3  105) were suspended in 100 ml of 1:6 Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and
orthotopically injected in 5-week-old nonobese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) mice
(Charles River Laboratories). Tumor size was measured
weekly with an electronic caliper and volume was calculated
using the formula: p/6  larger diameter  (smaller diameter)2. After 4 weeks, mice were treated intraperitoneally
either with doxorubicin (2 mg/kg, on day 2 and 5 every week
for 4 weeks) or 5-FU (150 mg/kg, on day 1 every week for
4 weeks), alone or in combination with EPO (150 U/kg, on
day 1 and 4 every week for 4 weeks). PBS was used as control.
At the end of the treatment, mice were sacriﬁced and tumors
were collected for histologic analyses. To determine the

in vivo effects of EPO on a metastatic breast cancer model,
NOD/SCID mice were orthotopically injected with 4.5  105
BCSCs carrying a Tween Luciferase–GFP lentiviral vector.
After cell inoculation, mice received a subcutaneous injection of D-luciferin (150 mg/kg; Promega) and were analyzed
by in vivo imaging (Biospace Laboratories). Five weeks later,
primary tumors of mice showing lung metastases (as measured by luciferase intensity) were removed and mice (n ¼ 4
per group) received respectively intraperitoneal injections
of PBS, paclitaxel (10 mg/kg, on day 1 every week for 3
weeks), EPO (300 U/kg on day 2 every week for 3 weeks), or
paclitaxel þ EPO. Three weeks later, mice were euthanized
and lungs were analyzed for luciferase expression. Data were
quantiﬁed with Biospace Lab M3 Vision software.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean  SD. The statistical
signiﬁcance of results was determined by Bonferroni
multiple comparison tests. Results were considered signiﬁcant when P values were less than 0.05 ( , P < 0.05;


Results and Discussion
BCSCs can be isolated from tumor specimens by selective
culture in medium containing EGF and bFGF (18), resulting in
a majority of CD44þ/CD24/low cells that form progressively
expanding tumor spheres (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig.
S1A). According to this method, ﬁve BCSC lines were isolated
from inﬁltrating breast tumors (Supplementary Table S1). Cells

isolated in such conditions fulﬁlled the functional characteristics of CSCs, as they were able to produce tumors in immunocompromised mice that replicate the original patient tumor
in terms of histologic structure and marker expression (Fig.

to EPO, we assessed whether the EPO receptor was detectable
on cultured CSC and on tissue sections of different breast

tumor subtypes, whose BCSC content was reportedly related to
increasing malignancy (19). Because of previous controversies
about the speciﬁcity of anti-EPO receptor antibodies, we used
only antibodies that were validated by recent authoritative
studies (see Materials and Methods). The speciﬁcity of the antiEPO receptor antibody used for immunoﬂuorescence and ﬂow
cytometry was further validated by assessing its ability to
detect EPO receptor increase in leukemic UT-7 EPO cells upon
growth factor starvation (Supplementary Fig. S1B; ref. 20).
Staining of intact BCSC with anti-EPOR antibody revealed
substantial (31–99%) EPOR expression on all the BCSC lines
examined (Fig. 1C), indicating a potential role of EPO in the
regulation of BCSC proliferation and survival. EPO receptor
was also detected on cultured BCSCs stained with CD49f
antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S1C), indicating its presence

on BCSC populations identiﬁed with different stem cell–associated markers. In tissue sections, strong EPO receptor expression was detected on the positive control (placenta) and on
basal-like tumors. EPO receptor was also present, at a lesser
extent, on HER2þ and luminal B tumors, whereas a faint
expression was detectable on luminal A tumors and on normal
breast, the latter showing a positivity at the limit of detection
(Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S2). Treatment of BCSC
cultures with recombinant human EPO resulted in increased
cell proliferation, indicating that EPOR expressed on BCSC
surface is functional and delivers signals that modulate cell
growth (Fig. 2B). To determine whether EPO was able to affect
BCSC self-renewal, cells derived from dissociated mammospheres were plated in soft agar in the presence or in the
absence of EPO. Colony scoring after 3 weeks showed a

signiﬁcantly higher number of colonies in EPO-treated samples
in 3 of 5 cases, indicating that EPO can increase BCSC selfrenewal in vitro (Fig. 2C).
BCSCs were previously shown to be more resistant than bulk
tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (14). Because EPO is
used almost exclusively in patients with cancer undergoing
chemotherapy, it is essential to clarify whether EPO can further
enhance BCSC resistance to chemotherapy, therefore favoring
drug resistance and tumor relapse. Upon treatment of mam-

mospheres with EPO and with chemotherapeutic agents commonly used for breast cancer therapy, we found that the
presence of EPO resulted in increased BCSC survival in the
presence of cytotoxic drugs (Fig. 3A and B). This observation
indicates that EPO activates survival signals in BCSCs that are
responsible for chemoresistance. To identify pathways downstream of EPOR that may be responsible for apoptosis resistance in BCSC, we analyzed levels of phospho-Akt, phosphoErk, and Bcl-xL at different time points upon EPO stimulation

EPO Promotes Chemoresistance of Breast Cancer Stem Cells

(Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S2). Phosphorylation/activation of Erk and Akt was maximal respectively 10 minutes and 2
hours after EPO stimulation in 5 of 5 and 4 of 5 BCSC lines (Fig.
3C). Differently, an increase in Bcl-xL levels was not apparent at
early time points of EPO stimulation (Supplementary Fig. S2),
but became clear in 5 of 5 BCSC lines after 48 hours of
treatment (Fig. 3C). Increase in pErk, pAkt, and Bcl-xL upon
EPO stimulation was apparent also in intact spheres (Fig. 3D).
To investigate whether EPO treatment affected tumor
response to chemotherapy in vivo, we produced orthotopic
breast tumors by injecting BCSC in the mammary fat pad of
NOD/SCID mice. Tumors were allowed to grow until they
reached the size of 50 mm3, then mice were treated with EPO
and/or chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin (Fig. 4A and B)
or 5-FU (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B) for 4 weeks, during
which tumor volume was constantly monitored with an
electronic caliper. Although vehicle-treated tumors grew exponentially, chemotherapy-treated tumors were signiﬁcantly
inhibited. In contrast, the growth of tumors treated with
EPO þ chemotherapy was similar to controls, indicating a
chemoprotective effect of EPO in vivo (Fig. 4A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S3A). Staining of xenograft sections at
the end of the treatment revealed an increased rate of apoptosis and lower levels of Bcl-xL expression in chemotherapytreated tumors but not in tumors treated with chemotherapy
and EPO in combination (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S3B).
These results indicate that EPO reduces the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy in vivo by promoting BCSC apoptosis resistance.
To investigate whether EPO could inﬂuence the growth of
metastatic tumors, we injected luciferase-transduced BCSC in
the mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice and awaited the
formation of spontaneous lung metastases. Five weeks after
BCSC injection, when metastases started to be detectable, the
primary tumor was removed to observe the effect of subsequent treatments solely on metastatic sites. Mice were then
treated for 3 weeks with EPO alone, with paclitaxel, or with the
EPO þ paclitaxel combination. At the end of the treatment,
mice were sacriﬁced and lungs were analyzed for luciferase
expression. Tumor burden in lungs of mice treated with EPO
alone was strongly increased as compared with that of control
mice (Fig. 4C and D). Enhanced metastatic progression was
also found in the lungs of mice treated with the paclitaxel þ
EPO combination as compared with mice treated with pacli-

taxel alone, indicating that EPO exerted a chemoprotective
effect on metastatic tumors (Fig. 4C and D).
Because the disclosure of clinical trials showing that ESAs
treatment had an adverse inﬂuence on patient survival, the
effect of EPO on tumor cells has been the subject of an intense
debate. Although ESAs likely inﬂuence patient survival through
multiple mechanisms, few in vivo studies have speciﬁcally
addressed the question of whether EPO modiﬁes tumor
response to therapy. We have shown for the ﬁrst time that
EPO can bind and stimulate BCSCs, resulting in increased
tumor growth and chemoresistance. These results conﬁrm and
expand previous observations by Hedley and colleagues on
xenografts obtained with breast cancer cell lines (10). In
patients with breast cancer, EPO-mediated BCSC stimulation
may not result in immediate effects on tumor growth or
response to chemotherapy, as BCSCs represent a minority of
cells, but may favor subsequent tumor relapse. Further clinical
studies that evaluate rates of relapse in ESA-treated patients
would be required to clarify this issue.
