cells through combined h1 and h2 integrin mechanisms (2). Recent
data suggest that the interaction between VLA-4 (a4h1 integrin) on
leukemic blasts and fibronectin on stromal cells activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/Bcl-2 signaling, an important
determinant of AML chemosensitivity and the level of minimal
residual disease of AML patients (3). Thus, activation of the
signaling cascades downstream of integrin engagement may play a
critical role in the well-documented chemoresistance of bone
marrow–resident AML cells.
Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) was proposed to play a central role
in integrin activation and signaling (4). ILK is a highly conserved
ankyrin repeat–containing serine-threonine protein kinase that
links the cell adhesion receptors, integrins, and growth factors to
the downstream signaling pathways. The activity of ILK that is
modulated by integrin ligation in a PI3K-dependent manner (5)
stimulates the phosphorylation of AktSer473 (6). Activated Akt phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK3h),
resulting in the nuclear localization of h-catenin and activated
transcription, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation (5).
Furthermore, ILK directly phosphorylates GSK3h and inhibits its
activity in neuroblastoma cells (7). Recent studies indicate that ILK
expression and activity are significantly up-regulated in several
types of cancers (8–11), hence providing a potential target for
cancer therapy.
The active cross-talk between signaling pathways responsible
for cell survival and apoptosis has recently been elucidated. In
particular, inhibition of GSK3h in the Wnt signaling system induces
Hes1 (12), which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
factor downstream of Notch and positively regulates the selfrenewal of hematopoietic stem cells (13). Cross-talk between the
Notch/Hes1 pathway and the Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 2/signal
transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway
has also been shown (14). Further, extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) 1/2 has recently been identified as a target of ILK
signaling in a cell culture model of renal epithelial morphogenesis
(15). Thus, it is possible that ILK functions upstream in the
hierarchy of these pathways such that its inhibition in turn inhibits
the activation of multiple pathways involved in tumor cell survival
and proliferation.
In this study, we used pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K and ILK
to determine the role of the respective pathways in bone marrow
stroma–supported AML cell survival and examined the mechanisms that coordinate PI3K/ILK/Akt signaling with stromainduced activation of other pathways. Our results elucidated the
prominent role of ILK in the interaction of bone marrow stromal
cells and leukemic cells that leads to the survival of leukemic cells.
In turn, pharmacologic blockade of PI3K/ILK axis inhibited
activation not only of Akt and GSK3h signaling pathways but also

Abstract
Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) directly interacts with B integrins
and phosphorylates Akt in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)–dependent manner. In this study, we examined the
functional role of ILK activation in leukemic and bone
marrow stromal cells on their direct contact. Coculture of
leukemic NB4 cells with bone marrow–derived stromal
mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) resulted in robust activation
of multiple signaling pathways, including ILK/Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), signal transducers
and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), and Notch1/Hes.
Blockade of PI3K or ILK signaling with pharmacologic
inhibitors LY294002 or QLT0267 specifically inhibited stroma-induced phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase
kinase 3B, suppressed STAT3 and ERK1/2 activation, and
decreased Notch1 and Hes1 expression in leukemic cells. This
resulted in induction of apoptosis in both leukemic cell lines
and in primary acute myelogenous leukemia samples that
was not abrogated by MSC coculture. In turn, leukemic cells
growing in direct contact with bone marrow stromal elements
induce activation of Akt, ERK1/2, and STAT3 signaling in MSC,
accompanied by significant increase in Hes1 and Bcl-2 proteins, which were all suppressed by QLT0267 and LY294002.
In summary, our results indicate reciprocal activation of
ILK/Akt in both leukemic and bone marrow stromal cells. We
propose that ILK/Akt is a proximal signaling pathway critical
for survival of leukemic cells within the bone marrow microenvironment. Hence, disruption of these interactions by ILK
inhibitors represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy to
eradicate leukemia in the bone marrow microenvironment by
simultaneous targeting of both leukemic cells and activated
bone marrow stromal cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):684–94]

Introduction
The bone marrow microenvironment plays a crucial role in the
pathogenesis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) by promoting
tumor cell growth and survival as well as drug resistance (1).
Integrins represent an essential component of the bone marrow
microenvironment that regulates cell survival by interacting with
the extracellular matrix. AML cells bind to bone marrow stromal

Stroma-Induced ILK Activation in Leukemic Cells
Briefly, cells were counterstained with allophycocyanin-conjugated antiCD45 and isotype control IgG1 antibody to distinguish CD45+ leukemic cells
and CD45 MSCs. Cells were then fixed using 2% formaldehyde at 37jC for
10 min and then resuspended in 90% ice-cold methanol for 30 min. Next,
cell suspensions were centrifuged and washed once with PBS containing 4%
bovine serum albumin and labeled with the FITC-conjugated p-STAT3Tyr705,
p-ERK1/2Thr202/Tyr204, or isotype control IgG1 antibody (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) for 30 min at 4jC. After one wash, samples were analyzed immediately by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Data acquisition and analysis were
done using the CellQuest software.
Reagents. The ILK inhibitor QLT0267 was obtained from QLT, Inc.
(Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; refs. 10, 11). QLT0267 is a submicromolar inhibitor of the phosphotransferase activity of ILK toward a
specific peptide substrate, which was identified in the high-throughput
screening of a rationally designed small-molecule library against the target
ILK. QLT0267 has been shown to inhibit the kinase activity at 26 nmol/L
and possess 1,000-fold selectivity over other kinases, including CK2, CSK,
DNA-PK, PIM1, protein kinase B or Akt kinase, and protein kinase C; and
100-fold selectivity over ERK1, GSK3h, LCK, protein kinase A, p70S6K, and
RSK1 (QLT; refs. 8, 10, 17). Recently, the specificity of QLT0267 as the ILK
inhibitor has been confirmed using the constitutively active mutant of ILK,
which protected cells from the inhibitory effect of QLT0267 (9). The PI3K
inhibitor LY294002, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase
(MEK) inhibitor PD98059, JAK2 inhibitor tyrphostin AG490, GSK3 inhibitor
IX (2¶Z,3¶E)-6-bromoindirubin-3¶-oxime (BIO), and g-secretase inhibitor XII
(Z-IL-CHO) were purchased from Calbiochem (Novabiochem Corp., La Jolla,
CA). The STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 (18), QLT0267 (10 Amol/L), LY294002
(20 Amol/L), WP1066 (2 Amol/L), AG490 (20 Amol/L), PD98059 (20 Amol/L),
BIO (100 nmol/L), and g-secretase inhibitor XII (10 Amol/L) were prepared
by diluting to the appropriate concentration in DMSO and stored at 20jC
with the culture medium before the in vitro exposure of cells.
Cell viability assay. Viable cells were identified by using the trypan blue
dye exclusion method and were counted in a hemocytometer.
Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. For the propidium iodide/Annexin V
binding studies done to analyze apoptosis, leukemic cells were washed
twice with PBS and then counterstained with allophycocyanin-conjugated
anti-CD45 (NB4 cells) or anti-CD90 (primary AML cells) and isotype control IgG1 antibody to exclude contamination of MSCs. Cells were
then resuspended in binding buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4),
140 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2; all from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO],
and FITC-conjugated Annexin V (Roche Diagnostics Co., Indianapolis, IN)
was added at a final concentration of 1 Ag/mL. The mixture was incubated
at room temperature for 15 min in the dark before flow cytometric analysis.
Membrane integrity was simultaneously assessed by propidium iodide
staining (0.25 Ag/mL). Flow cytometry done using Annexin V fluorescence
was determined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and

of multiple prosurvival signaling pathways in both leukemic and
stromal cells, indicating its proximal role in the leukemia/stroma
interactions.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures. Human promyelocytic leukemic NB4 cells were kindly
provided by Dr. M. Lanotte (Hôpital St. Louis, Paris, France; ref. 16). Human
monocyte U937 cells, human lymphoma Raji cells, human pre-B lymphocyte
REH cells, and NB4 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine, and penicillinstreptomycin at 37jC in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Human
megakaryocytic leukemia MO7e cells (provided by Dr. H. Broxmeyer, Indiana
University, Indianapolis, IN) were supplemented with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (37 units/mL; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth,
NJ) and maintained under conditions similar to those described for the other
cell lines. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) obtained from a normal bone
marrow donor were cultured at a density of 0.2  105/cm2 in MEMa with
20% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Passage 3 or 4 MSCs
were used for the coculture experiments.
Leukemic cells were cultured at a starting concentration of 5  105/mL
with and without 0.2  105/cm2 MSC stromal layer in serum-free ( for NB4,
U937, Raji, and REH cells) or cytokine-free conditions ( for MO7e cells). To
study the effects of the soluble factors produced by MSCs, conditioned
serum-free medium from the culture of 1-day-old MSCs was added to the
NB4 cell culture.
Samples of bone marrow or peripheral blood were obtained for in vitro
studies from patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent AML with high
(>70%) blast count after informed consent according to the institutional
guidelines (Table 1). Mononuclear cells were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) density gradient centrifugation and
cocultured with MSC for 24 h in MEMa with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine,
and penicillin-streptomycin, after which they were exposed to LY294002
(20 Amol/L) or QLT0267 (10 Amol/L) for 48 h.
Cocultured leukemic cells were separated from MSC monolayer by
careful pipetting with ice-cold PBS (repeated twice). After collecting the
leukemic cells, MSC monolayer was observed under microscopy (100) to
confirm that MSC monolayer was not damaged and that <10 leukemic cells
per vision field remained attached. MSC monolayer was then trypsinized,
and cells were counted using the trypan blue dye in a hemocytometer.
To verify lack of significant contamination in collected leukemic cells and
MSC fractions and to evaluate cell type–specific phosphorylation, the
expression of phosphorylated (p)-STAT3 and p-ERK1/2 in cocultured
leukemic cells and trypsinized MSCs was measured by two-color flow
cytometry using CD45 as a discriminator between leukemic cells and MSCs.

Lake Placid, NY); Akt, p-AktSer473, p-GSK3a/hSer9/12, STAT3, p-STAT3Tyr705,
p-STAT3Ser727, and p-MAPKThr202/Tyr204 (p-ERK1/2; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); p42MAPK (ERK1/2) and Notch1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); Hes1 (provided by Dr. Tetsuo Sudo, Toray Research
Center, Tsukuba, Japan; ref. 19); and h-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA).
Membranes were then probed with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibody and reacted with electrochemiluminescence reagent
(Amersham Biosciences, Baie d’Urfe, Quebec, Canada). Signals were detected
by a luminescent image analyzer (LAS-100 Plus, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and
quantified by Image Gauge (Fujifilm).
ILK kinase assay. ILK kinase assay was done using nonradioactive Akt
kinase kit (Cell Signaling Technology) as described previously (10). Briefly,
ILK was immunoprecipitated from 200 Ag of cell lysate using 1 Ag of a
specific anti-ILK antibody and protein A agarose (Life Technologies,
Rockville, MD). The ILK-containing agarose pellet was washed twice in
assay buffer and twice in kinase buffer (both from Cell Signaling
Technology) followed by incubation with 200 Amol/L ATP and 1 Ag of

data acquisition and analysis were done with CellQuest software (BD
Biosciences).
The cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry analysis of
propidium iodide–stained nuclei. Briefly, NB4 cells were washed twice with
PBS, fixed in ice-cold ethanol [70% (v/v) in water], and stained with the
propidium iodide solution [25 Ag/mL propidium iodide, 180 units/mL
RNase, 0.15% Triton X-100, and 30 mg/mL polyethylene glycol in 4 mmol/L
citrate buffer (pH 7.8); all from Sigma-Aldrich]. The DNA content was
determined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and the ModFit computer
program (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) was used for cell cycle
analysis. Cells with a sub-G1 DNA content were considered apoptotic.
Western blot analysis. NB4 cells and trypsinized MSCs were washed
twice with PBS and lysed in cell lysis buffer (10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 0.1% NaN3,
10 mmol/L iodoacetamide, 3 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Diagnostics). Equal amounts of lysate (equivalent to 30 Ag protein) were
separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules,

coculture.

GSK3 fusion protein for 30 min at 30jC. The reaction was terminated with
20 AL of 3 SDS sample buffer, and the supernatants were boiled for 5 min
and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylation of the
substrate was detected by Western blot analysis with the anti–p-GSK3a/
hSer9/12 antibody. The amount of ILK immunoprecipitated from 30 Ag of the
cell lysate was determined by immunoblot with anti-ILK antibody.
Immunofluorescence staining. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 90% methanol in TBST buffer (10 mmol/L Tris, 15 mmol/L NaCl,
0.1% Triton X-100) for 15 min, and rinsed with PBS for 5 min. Next, cells
were blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 30 min and incubated with
anti–h-catenin (Cell Signaling Technology), Notch1 (extracellular domain),
cleaved Notch1 (intracellular domain), Hes1, p-AktSer473, p-GSK3hSer9 (Cell
Signaling Technology), p-STAT3Tyr705, and p-ERK1/2Thr202/Tyr204 antibodies
(1:100) overnight at 4jC. Excess antibody was removed by washing with
PBS. Cells were then incubated with secondary antibody, either FITClabeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (H+L; 1:250; Caltag, Burlingame, CA),
for 30 min at 37jC. Cells were washed with PBS, mounted on slides, and
analyzed under a Zeiss LSM 510 laser confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Thornwood, NY).

leukemic cell lines, NB4, U937, Raji, REH, and MO7e. As shown in
Fig. 1A, ILK protein was highly expressed in all cell lines, and the
expression was not affected by 24-h coculture of the leukemic cells
with MSCs. ILK was also expressed in MSCs. In addition, ILK protein levels were unchanged following treatment with ILK inhibitor
QLT0267 (9) in both NB4 cells and MSCs (Fig. 1A). In contrast,
coculture with MSC resulted in increased ILK kinase activity in
leukemic cells as determined in an in vitro kinase activity assay
(ILK kinase activity; Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). QLT0267 moderately
reduced basal ILK kinase activity in NB4 cells but potently
abrogated stroma-induced ILK activation (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4).
Because the regulation of intracellular signaling molecules
through ILK involves the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3h
(6, 8, 9) and the direct phosphorylation of Akt is cell type dependent
(20), we next examined the phosphorylation levels of Akt and
GSK3h in NB4 leukemic cells cultured with and without MSCs.
Nonadherent NB4 cells were separated from MSC as described
in Materials and Methods, and the purity of leukemic cells was
assured by flow cytometry using anti-CD45 antibody (>95%
CD45+ cells; data not shown). NB4 cells incubated in serum-free
medium without MSCs expressed low levels of p-AktSer473 and
p-GSK3hSer9, but phosphorylation was significantly increased by
the 5- to 10-min coculture with MSCs (Fig. 1B). Further, the
expression of h-catenin, which interacts with GSK3h (21), was
induced with concomitant translocation into the nucleus where it
normally activates gene expression (MSC control versus MSC+
control; Fig. 1C; ref. 22).

Stroma-Induced ILK Activation in Leukemic Cells

Because the h1 integrin cytoplasmic domain was reported to
activate ERK1/2 (23) and the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway downstream of Akt can phosphorylate STAT3 on
Ser727 (24), we next examined changes in the activation of STAT3
and MAPK in NB4 cells cultured with and without MSCs. The NB4
cells cultured with MSCs showed a considerable increase in
p-ERK1/2 and p-STAT3Tyr705 (Fig. 1B) but not p-STAT3Ser727 (data
not shown). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was induced within the first
5 min, whereas STAT3Tyr705 phosphorylation was delayed and
remained at markedly high levels at 24 h of cocultivation with MSCs
(Fig. 1B). We confirmed specific induction of p-ERK and p-STAT3 in
leukemic cells identified by CD45 immunofluorescence in two-color
flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1D). Thus, from this, it seems that
multiple prosurvival signaling cascades, including the PI3K/ILK/
Akt/GSK3h, with the nuclear localization of h-catenin, JAK2/STAT3,
and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways are activated in leukemic cells cultured
in direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells.
Pharmacologic PI3K or ILK inhibitors block activation of
PI3K/ILK/Akt, JAK/STAT3, and MAPK/ERK pathways in NB4
cells cultured with MSCs. Because multiple prosurvival pathways
are activated in leukemic cells by virtue of their interactions with
MSC, we next attempted to dissect a functional role of each of
these pathways by use of the respective pharmacologic inhibitors.
To determine whether the stroma-induced phosphorylation of Akt
and GSK3h is ILK dependent, we first assessed the effects of the
specific ILK inhibitor QLT0267 on p-Akt and p-GSK3h levels in NB4
cells cocultured with MSCs. QLT0267 suppressed MSC-induced
p-AktSer473 and p-GSK3hSer9 (Fig. 2A), which inhibited the translocation of h-catenin into the nucleus (MSC+, compare control and
QLT0267; Fig. 1C). No effect on phosphorylation of Thr308 of Akt
(PDK-1 site) was noted (data not shown). Unexpectedly, QLT0267
also decreased MSC-triggered p-ERK1/2 and p-STAT3 Tyr705
(Fig. 2A). Similar changes were induced by the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002, suggesting that ILK induces Akt and GSK3h phosphorylation and h-catenin translocation into cell nuclei in a PI3Kdependent manner. Likewise, QLT0267 abrogated MSC-induced
p-AktSer473, p-ERK1/2, and p-STAT3Tyr705 expression in two other
leukemic cell lines, REH and MO7e cells (Fig. 2B).
We next examined the putative feedback cross-talk among
STAT3, MAPK, and ILK/Akt pathways by use of STAT3 inhibitor
WP1066 and MEK inhibitor PD98059. These inhibitors effectively
blocked MSC-induced activation of their respective targets, STAT3
and ERK1/2, but failed to suppress the MSC-induced phosphorylation of the ILK downstream targets, Akt and GSK3h (Fig. 2C).
Tyrphostin AG490, an established inhibitor of the JAK2/STAT3
pathway, likewise had no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt and
GSK3h (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that
ILK is a proximal kinase activated by MSC in leukemic cells that in
turn regulates activation of MAPK and STAT3 signaling.

Cross-talk among ILK/Akt/GSK3B, Notch/Hes, and JAK/
STAT3 signaling. Wnt and Notch signaling pathways are critical
regulators of normal and leukemia stem cell survival (12, 25). To
determine if coculture with MSCs activates Notch signaling, we
examined the expression of the intracellular form of active
(cleaved) Notch1 and of Hes1, a transcriptional target of Notch1
(26), in NB4 cells by Western blot and confocal microscopic
analyses. The endogenous Notch1 was expressed in NB4 cells as
determined by immunofluorescence staining with antibody that
recognizes extracellular domain of Notch1 (Fig. 3A). MSC coculture
activated Notch signaling as shown by increased expression of
cleaved intracellular Notch1 (MSC control versus MSC+ control;
Fig. 3A) and Hes1 (MSC control versus MSC+ control; Fig. 3B, i and
ii), which was evident after 60 min of MSC coculture (Fig. 3B, i).
Hes1, a Notch target gene, can be induced by GSK3h inhibition
(phosphorylation of GSK3h) through up-regulation of Notchdependent transcription of the Hes1 promoter (12, 26). A recent
report documented the cross-talk between Notch and Wnt
signaling pathways (27, 28). Because ILK is activated upstream of
GSK3h in our system, we examined the effects of ILK inhibition on
Notch signaling. Our results showed that QLT0267 diminished
MSC-induced induction of Hes1 (Fig. 3B, ii and iii) possibly via the
inhibitory phosphorylation of ILK direct target GSK3h. Similar
results were obtained in REH and MO7e cells (Fig. 3B, iv). To
confirm the role of GSK3h as a critical intermediate between ILK
and Hes1/Notch induction, we investigated the molecular effects of
the direct GSK3 inhibitor BIO. Treatment with 100 nmol/L BIO
increased p-GSK3h in NB4 cells growing without stromal support
(Fig. 3C), which was accompanied by the nuclear translocation of
h-catenin (Fig. 1C) and increased expression of cleaved Notch1
(Fig. 3A) as shown by confocal microscopy. The GSK3 inhibition
might therefore contribute to NB4 cell survival in part through
activation of the Notch signaling. Recently, it has been reported
that Hes1 protein binds directly to STAT3 and activates JAK2/
STAT3 signaling (14). We therefore investigated the effects of Notch
blockade on STAT3 phosphorylation. Treatment with the Notch
inhibitor, g-secretase inhibitor, prevented MSC-induced cleaved
Notch1 (Fig. 3A) and Hes1 (Fig. 3B, ii) and significantly decreased
p-STAT3Tyr705 expression (Fig. 3D), indicating contribution of
Notch in the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling. In contrast,
blockade of STAT3 or MAPK activation by WP1066 or PD98059,
respectively, did not affect Hes1 expression (data not shown).
MSCs prevent serum deprivation–induced apoptosis but not
QLT0267-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells. We next examined the
ability of MSCs to support survival of leukemic cells under
conditions of serum deprivation. NB4 cells cultured without serum
rapidly undergo apoptosis at 48 h as determined by Annexin V
positivity. In contrast, coculture with MSC significantly protected
NB4 cells from apoptosis (Fig. 4A). This finding was confirmed by

To determine whether ILK inhibition affects leukemic cell
survival, we next studied the extent of apoptosis induced by

only moderately affected apoptosis of serum-deprived NB4 cells
(12 F 3.5%). Remarkably, QLT0267-induced apoptosis was
enhanced by coculture with MSC, with an average of 29% more

DNA flow cytometry, in which the number of sub-G1 cells among
the NB4 cells cultured with MSCs was diminished compared with
cells cultured alone (MSC versus MSC+: 39.5 F 3.4% versus 28.6 F
5.9%; P < 0.05; data not shown). These data suggest that the MSCs
inhibit serum deprivation–induced apoptosis in the NB4 cells in
confirmation of our reported findings (29).

Stroma-Induced ILK Activation in Leukemic Cells

found a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of Akt,
GSK3h, ERK1/2, and STAT3Tyr705 that was induced within the first
10 min and remained at markedly high levels at 24 h of cocultivation with NB4 (Fig. 5A). The p-AktSer473, p-STAT3Tyr705, and p-ERK1/2
up-regulation in MSCs cultured with NB4 cells was confirmed by
flow cytometric analyses using cell size and CD45 staining as a
discriminator of leukemic cells from MSC (data not shown).
We assessed next the effects of QLT0267 and LY294002 on p-Akt,
p-ERK1/2, Hes1, and Bcl-2 levels in MSCs cultured with NB4 cells.
QLT0267 significantly suppressed the NB4-induced p-AktSer473,
p-ERK1/2, and Hes1 levels but only slightly decreased the pSTAT3Tyr705 and Bcl-2 levels in MSCs (Fig. 5B). On the other hand,
LY294002 specifically inhibited Bcl-2 expression and abrogated
p-AktSer473, p-ERK1/2, and Hes1 along with only moderately
suppressed p-STAT3Tyr705 (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that
leukemic cells activate the PI3K/ILK/Akt pathway in MSCs, which
induces Notch/Hes1 signaling, and phosphorylate ERK1/2 along
with increase in Bcl-2 expression.

cells undergoing apoptosis compared with control NB4 cells
growing in MSC coculture (Fig. 4A). On the contrary, mimicking
ILK-induced inactivation of GSK3 with direct GSK3 inhibitor BIO
prevented serum withdrawal–induced apoptosis in stroma-free
conditions (Fig. 4A), in support of the antiapoptotic role of ILKGSK3h pathway in the context of bone marrow microenvironment.
Next, we examined the effects of LY294002, PD98059, and
WP1066 in NB4/MSC cocultures. Whereas MSC cocultivation did
not protect NB4 cells from LY294002-induced apoptosis, WP1066and PD98059-induced apoptosis was partially but significantly
inhibited by MSCs (Fig. 4A). The effect of the JAK2 inhibitor AG490
was similar to that of WP1066 (AG490-induced Annexin V positivity
in NB4 cells: MSC 49.3 F 5.4% versus MSC+ 40.9 F 3.2%; P = 0.04;
data not shown). These data indicate that inhibition of stromainduced PI3K/ILK, but not of ERK1/2 or STAT3 signaling, is able to
overcome the protective effects of MSCs on survival of leukemic
cells. On the contrary, blockade of Notch signaling by g-secretase
inhibitor promoted apoptosis of NB4 cells both in MSC and MSC+
conditions (Fig. 4A) similar to the effects of PI3K/ILK inhibition.
The effects of MSCs and QLT0267 on serum deprivation– or
cytokine deprivation–induced apoptosis in REH and MO7e cells
were further examined. As shown in Fig. 4B, MSC coculture
protected viability in REH cells; however, MSC enhanced QLT0267and LY294002-induced apoptosis. Similarly, QLT0267-induced
apoptosis was enhanced when MSCs were cocultured with
cytokine-deprived MO7e cells, and modest apoptosis induced by
LY294002 was not inhibited by MSC.
We next investigated the effects of QLT0267 and LY294002 in
seven primary AML samples cocultured with MSC (Fig. 4C;
Table 1). In five of seven primary AML samples, MSC coculture
protected AML cells from spontaneous apoptosis (% CD90
Annexin V+ cells, AML control in medium only, 35.8 F 5.9%;
AML + MSC, 21.0 F 3.5%; P = 0.03), whereas in two additional
samples no spontaneous apoptosis was observed. To correct for
differences in spontaneous apoptosis, we calculated percentage
specific apoptosis as [test (inhibitor-induced apoptosis) control
(spontaneous apoptosis)]  100 / (100
control). As shown in
Fig. 4C, inhibition of PI3K/ILK signaling induced apoptosis in
both suspension and MSC cocultured AML cells. Importantly,
QLT0267 induced a higher degree of specific apoptosis in five of
seven and LY294002 in four of seven AML samples cocultured with
MSC compared with AML cells cultured in medium. This resulted
in corresponding loss of viability as determined by cell counts with
trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 4C).
NB4 cells prevent serum deprivation–induced apoptosis in
MSCs and up-regulate p-Akt, p-STAT3, Hes1, and Bcl-2 protein
in MSCs in part through activation of PI3K/ILK/Akt signaling.
The phenomenon of ‘‘tumor-associated fibroblasts’’ that are
activated by tumor cells and acquire the ability to further promote
tumor growth has been recently characterized (30); however, no
data are available on the activation of bone marrow stroma in
leukemias. Notably, ILK activation was reported in tumorassociated fibroblasts (11) and endothelial cells (31). We therefore hypothesized that cell-to-cell contact with NB4 cells activates
the h1 integrin-ILK/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in MSCs, which
may contribute to their ability to support growth of leukemic cells.
The phosphorylation levels of Akt, GSK3h, STAT3, and ERK1/2 and
the expression of Hes1 and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 were
examined in MSCs isolated after coculture with or without NB4
cells. The purity of isolated MSCs was assured by flow cytometry
using anti-CD45 antibody (>94% CD45 cells; data not shown). We

Discussion
In this study, we characterized signaling cascades activated on
direct contact of leukemic cells with bone marrow–derived stromal
cells. Our findings indicate stroma-induced activation of ILK with
phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3h. Because p-GSK3hSer9 is a
known cellular target of ILK (7), these results are consistent with
evidence of ILK activation induced by growth factors or
engagement of the integrins by stroma. We further showed that
the nuclear accumulation of h-catenin, a downstream GSK3h
target, was induced in NB4 cells by coculture with MSCs and that
this accumulation was abrogated when the PI3K/ILK pathway was
inhibited. In contrast, the GSK3 inhibitor BIO, which prevented the
serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells, stimulated the
translocation of h-catenin to the nucleus in cells growing without
stromal support. Altogether, these findings provide evidence that
stroma-induced ILK activation results in GSK3 inhibition and
up-regulation of nuclear h-catenin consistent with similar observations in transformed mammary epithelial cells (32).
Although the constitutive activation of ILK is known to promote
cell survival by stimulating AktSer473 phosphorylation (6, 8, 9), the
mechanisms that coordinate PI3K/ILK/Akt signaling with other
signaling pathways are poorly understood. Our data provide
evidence of cross-talk between the PI3K/ILK/Akt pathway and
other signaling pathways that have overlapping roles in cell
survival (i.e., the Notch/Hes1, JAK2/STAT3, and MEK/ERK pathways; Fig. 5C). In particular, the Notch/Hes1 signaling pathway
plays a critical role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and
apoptosis (33). Wnt signaling, by repressing GSK3, was shown to
cause accumulation of h-catenin and intracellular fragments of
Notch in the nucleus, which results in the activation of Notch
targets, such as Hes1 (26). Notably, ILK activity has been shown to
modulate Wnt-mediated h-catenin stabilization and nuclear
translocation via inhibitory GSK3h phosphorylation (17). Moreover,
GSK3 inhibition can modulate gene targets of Wnt, Hedgehog, and
Notch pathways in primitive hematopoietic stem cells (28). Other
studies using the genetic and pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K
and/or Akt have identified Akt as an intermediate critical to
Notch1 signaling (34). In our coculture system, the marked increase
in cleaved Notch1 and Hes1 expression in NB4 cells induced by
MSCs was blocked by QLT0267 and LY294002. Conversely, the
GSK3 inhibitor BIO induced reciprocal increase in cleaved Notch1

signaling was reported to induce cell cycle arrest (38, 39) and bone
marrow stroma–mediated activation of Notch1 signaling was
reported to up-regulate p21, resulting in growth inhibition and
protection from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of myeloma cells
(40). Curiously, both the oncogenic and tumor-suppressive
properties of Notch1 are known to take place at the same time,
and the final outcome is dependent on the cellular context (41).

expression. These data indicate that stroma-activated PI3K and
ILK, the upstream kinases of GSK3, trigger activation of Notch
signaling, which may be one of the critical mediators of leukemia
cell survival in the bone marrow microenvironment. Notch
receptors (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4) and ligands
(Delta-like 1, Delta-like 4, and Jagged1) are expressed on both
hematopoietic progenitors and stromal cells (35, 36), and the
overexpression of the intracellular domain of Notch promotes their
self-renewal (37) through up-regulation of the expression of Hes1, a
direct target of Notch (12, 13, 26, 27). On the other hand, Notch

Stroma-Induced ILK Activation in Leukemic Cells

and in fact enhanced cell death in approximately half of the case
studied. These findings indicate that the proapoptotic responses of
AML cells to ILK and/or PI3K inhibition are preserved in the context of bone marrow microenvironment due to specific activation of
this pathway as a consequence of leukemia/stroma cell interactions.
Consistent with the recent finding that h1 integrin–activated
ILK in fibroblasts regulates cell viability via an Akt-dependent
mechanism (46), we found that leukemic cells induce a ‘‘leukemiaassociated stroma’’ phenotype in MSC, with phosphorylation and
increases of p-AktSer473, p-GSK3h, Hes1, p-ERK1/2, and Bcl-2,
which were abrogated by ILK and PI3K inhibitors. Although we
did not investigate in detail the molecular mechanisms underlying
induction of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in MSCs, ILK-induced
Akt activation has been reported to contribute to the integrindependent up-regulation of Bcl-2 (47). Alternatively, Notch
overexpression was shown to increase Notch-dependent Hes1
transcription in stromal cells (48), and the intracellular domain of
Notch1 increases the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein
(49). Notably, Notch1 and its ligand Jagged1 proteins are widely
expressed in AML cells (50), providing a plausible explanation for
this phenomenon. As such, leukemic cells may activate stromal
cells as it was shown in the models of solid tumors (43), and this
possibly results in reciprocal secretion of cytokines by stroma and
further supports survival of leukemic cells.
In summary, our data suggest that the PI3K/ILK/Akt pathway is
a critical prosurvival pathway activated in both leukemic and bone
marrow stromal cells on their interactions. In turn, inhibition of
ILK/Akt signaling may overcome the protective effects of the bone
marrow microenvironment on leukemic cells and thereby potentially ameliorate chemoresistance. Hence, targeting both leukemic
and stromal cells via selective blockade of ILK represents a novel
therapeutic approach to eradicate leukemia in the bone marrow
microenvironment. Although further studies are required for the
elucidation of the role of the bone marrow microenvironment and
its ability to activate specific signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of leukemias, focus on this stroma-leukemia cross-talk may
result in the development of strategies that alleviate the acquisition
of a chemoresistant phenotype and enhance the efficacy of
therapies in hematologic malignancies.

The studies elucidating detailed molecular mechanisms and
functional role of activation of Notch signaling in leukemic cells
by bone marrow stroma are ongoing.
We found that MSCs induced the phosphorylation of STAT3Tyr705
but not STAT3Ser727 in NB4 cells, which was inhibited by QLT0267
and LY294002. This observation is concordant with findings in
pancreatic cancer cells in which ILK inhibition was shown to block
phosphorylation of STAT3Tyr705 (42). The mTOR pathway downstream of Akt is responsible for STAT3Ser727 phosphorylation,
whereas STAT3Tyr705 is phosphorylated through JAK2 or receptor
and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases at the plasma membrane before
dimerization and translocation to the nucleus for phosphorylation
of the serine site by mTOR (42). The recently reported cross-talk
between Notch/Hes1 and JAK2/STAT3 showed that the Hes1 protein functions as a nonreceptor scaffold protein that allows JAK2 to
phosphorylate STAT3Tyr705 (14). It is possible that the phosphorylation of STAT3Tyr705 is indirectly induced by ILK/Akt through
activation of Notch/Hes1 signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis,
blockade of Notch signaling by g-secretase inhibitor abrogated
STAT3Tyr705 phosphorylation in NB4 cells cocultured with MSC.
PI3K/mTOR and MEK signaling pathways have been reported to
synergistically cooperate in the ability of stroma to support survival
of leukemic cells (43). Notably, transgenic mice expressing ILK in
the mammary epithelium (mouse mammary tumor virus/ILK
mice) developed a hyperplastic mammary phenotype accompanied
by the constitutive phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt,
GSK3h, and MAPK (44). In the coculture system, MSCs stimulated
the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in leukemic cells, and this effect
was efficiently blocked by QLT0267 or LY294002. Inhibition of ERK
activity by PD98059 or inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling by
WP1066 or AG490 did not affect MSC-dependent stimulation of
p-Akt and p-GSK3h. These data indicate that stroma-activated ILK
can at least partially regulate ERK1/2 and STAT3 activation.
Recently, the direct interplay between tumor cell and neighboring
endothelial cells through MAPK and Notch signaling pathways was
characterized (45). Further studies are required to fully dissect the
contribution of ERK1/2 and STAT3 signaling in the supportive role
of stromal cells in leukemic cell survival.
Our data therefore place ILK upstream of Notch1/Hes1, JAK2/
STAT3, and MEK/ERK1/2 signaling in the leukemia/MSC interplay
and suggest that bone marrow stromal cells activate ILK in a PI3Kdependent manner at a point where the stimulatory signals converge (Fig. 5C). In agreement with these results, the small-molecule
ILK inhibitor QLT0267 and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the
ability of stroma to protect NB4 cells from apoptosis; this was
accompanied by the specific inhibition of stroma-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3h. Analogous results were obtained in
MO7e and REH leukemic cells and in a subset of primary AML
samples. In contrast to well-documented inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (29), MSC failed to protect primary AML
cells from apoptosis triggered in response to PI3K/ILK activation
