Abstract

Author Manuscript

Many estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers respond well initially to endocrine therapies, but
often develop resistance during treatment with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
such as tamoxifen. We have reported that the 14-3-3 family member and conserved protein,
14-3-3ζ, is up-regulated by tamoxifen and that high expression correlated with an early time to
disease recurrence. However, the mechanism by which tamoxifen up-regulates 14-3-3ζ and may
promote the development of endocrine resistance is not known. Our findings herein reveal that the
tamoxifen up-regulation of 14-3-3ζ results from its ability to rapidly down-regulate miR-451 that
specifically targets 14-3-3ζ. The levels of 14-3-3ζ and miR-451 were inversely correlated, with
14-3-3ζ being elevated and miR-451 being at a greatly reduced level in tamoxifen-resistant breast
cancer cells. Of note, down-regulation of miR-451 was selectively elicited by tamoxifen but not
by other SERMs such as raloxifene or ICI182,780 (Fulvestrant). Increasing the level of miR-451
by overexpression, which decreased 14-3-3ζ, suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation,
markedly reduced activation of HER2, EGFR, and MAPK signaling, increased apoptosis, and
importantly, restored the growth inhibitory effectiveness of SERMs in endocrine-resistant cells.
Opposite effects were elicited by miR-451 knock-down. Thus, we identify tamoxifen downregulation of miR-451, and consequent elevation of the key survival factor 14-3-3ζ, as a
mechanistic basis of tamoxifen-associated development of endocrine resistance. These findings
suggest that therapeutic approaches to increase expression of this tumor suppressor-like
microRNA should be considered to down-regulate 14-3-3ζ and enhance the effectiveness of
endocrine therapies. Furthermore, the selective ability of the SERM tamoxifen but not raloxifene
to regulate miR-451 and 14-3-3ζ may assist in understanding differences in their activities, as seen
in the STAR breast cancer prevention trial and in other clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Tamoxifen has proven to be one of the most successful agents in the management of
estrogen receptor (ER) -positive breast cancers, and it has been a mainstay of endocrine
therapy for breast cancer over the last 30 years. Large studies have shown its value in the
improvement of survival in early breast cancer (EBCTCG 2005, Osborne 1998) as well as
an improvement in the quality of life for patients with metastatic disease (Jaiyesimi et al
1995). However, despite the remarkable benefits of using ER- targeted therapies, including
selective ER modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen in the ca. 70% of women with
hormone-sensitive breast cancers expressing ERs, many will eventually experience disease
progression, due to the development of resistance to the therapy. The mechanisms that
underlie endocrine resistance are complex and are not fully understood, despite significant
advances in defining some of the players involved (Arpino et al 2008, Creighton et al 2006,
Green and Carroll 2007, Massarweh et al 2008).
In a previous study, based on genome-wide gene expression analyses in human breast
tumors and in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, we found 14-3-3ζ (also known
as YWHAZ) to be up-regulated by tamoxifen and we observed a poor clinical outcome on
tamoxifen treatment for patients with high levels of 14-3-3ζ in their breast tumors (Frasor et
al 2006). This correlation between overexpression of 14-3-3ζ and early onset of recurrence
was also observed by us in data from other large microarray gene expression studies,
implying 14-3-3ζ to be a marker of a poor prognosis in women with ER-positive breast
cancers (Bergamaschi et al 2009).

Author Manuscript

14-3-3ζ is a member of the highly conserved family of seven 14-3-3 proteins, all encoded by
different genes (Tzivion et al 2006). 14-3-3ζ serves as a pivotal factor that binds and
stabilizes key proteins involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation and apoptosis
(Ando et al 2004, Costa 2005), including EGFR, HER2, PKC, β-catenin, and RAF-1
(Filipowicz et al 2008, McPherson et al 1999, Oksvold et al 2004).

Author Manuscript

In view of the very detrimental role of 14-3-3ζ in promoting cancer cell survival and
endocrine resistance, we were interested in understanding how 14-3-3ζ is regulated, and in
particular, how cellular levels of 14-3-3ζ might be down-regulated to enhance
responsiveness to endocrine therapies. Since growing evidence links microRNAs (miRs) to
the control of many crucial processes in cancer including proliferation, differentiation and
apoptosis (Croce 2009), we have herein explored the involvement of miRs in the regulation
of 14-3-3ζ. The great importance of miRs is underscored by the fact that they are estimated
to play roles in regulating the expression of more than one-third of all human genes. miRs,
which are small, ca. 22 nucleotide RNA sequences, bind principally to the 3’UTR region of
mRNAs of protein-coding target genes to direct their repression by destabilizing target
mRNAs and decreasing mRNA translational efficiency (Bartel 2004, Guo et al 2010, Harfe
2005).
In the present study, to investigate the mechanism underlying tamoxifen up-regulation of
14-3-3ζ, we first identified, by bioinformatic analysis, potential miRs that might regulate
14-3-3ζ, and we then went on to show tamoxifen down-regulation of miR-451 and to

delineate the role of miR-451 in regulating 14-3-3ζ and its impact on the aggressiveness, cell
survival properties, and endocrine sensitivity of ER-positive breast cancer cells. The
findings suggest that increasing the cellular level of miR-451 might be a useful therapeutic
approach for reversing endocrine resistance and enhancing the efficacy of endocrine
therapies in the greater than 40% of breast tumors that overexpress 14-3-3ζ.

RESULTS
Tamoxifen down-regulates miR-451 and there is an inverse relationship between miR-451
and 14-3-3ζ levels

Although we have reported 14-3-3ζ to be up-regulated by the antiestrogen (SERM)
tamoxifen in breast cancer (Frasor et al 2006), the mechanism regulating tamoxifen-driven
stimulation of 14-3-3ζ is not known. Given the growing evidence for the importance of
miRNAs in regulating gene expression, we envisioned that miRNAs might play an
important role in modulating 14-3-3ζ expression. Using two different target prediction
algorithms, TargetScan (http://www.targetScan.org/) and miRanda (http://
www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do), we found nine miRNAs that were predicted by both
algorithms to target 14-3-3ζ. From these, we chose to investigate miR-451 because it
showed relatively few potential targets, and 14-3-3ζ was the only predicted target from the
14-3-3 family. We then examined whether tamoxifen might regulate miR-451. As shown in
Fig.1A, where we monitored the effects of different estrogen receptor ligands on miR-451
expression, we observed that only Tam had the ability to down-regulate miR-451 and that
down-regulation occurred as early as 4 h, whereas the estrogen estradiol (E2), the SERM
raloxifene (Ral), and the pure antiestrogen ICI182,780 (ICI, Fulvestrant) had no effect on
miR-451. The downregulation of miR-451 by Tam was reversed by excess ICI implying
mediation of the Tam effect by estrogen receptor. Likewise, depletion of ERα by ca. 90% by
cell treatment with siRNA targeting ERα (Chang et al 2008) eliminated the down-regulation
of miR-451 by tamoxifen (Fig. 1A).
To further explore the regulation of miR-451 by tamoxifen, we analyzed the presence over
time of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at the transcription start site (TSS) of miR-451 (TSS
derived from data of Welboren et al. 2009) in cells treated with control vehicle or Tam.
Interestingly, we found that Tam treatment markedly reduced the level of Pol II at the TSS
of miR-451 (Fig.1B), consistent with the down-regulation of miR-451 expression we
observed upon treatment with tamoxifen.

The highly conserved miR-451 gene is located on chromosome 17, only 100 bp upstream of
another miR, miR-144. We therefore examined if this nearby miR-144 was also regulated by
Tam or other ER ligands. As shown in Fig.1C, we observed that Tam had no effect on the
expression of miR-144, indicating the selectivity of tamoxifen for miR-451 regulation.
We next examined the levels of miR-451 in parental MCF7 and in tamoxifen resistant
MCF7 (TamR) cells and found that parental cells expressed 3-times more miR-451 than did
TamR cells (Fig. 1D), whereas TamR cells had higher levels of 14-3-3ζ (Fig. 1E), suggesting
an inverse relationship between these two factors. Further, upon treatment of both MCF7
and TamR cells with tamoxifen, we observed a time-dependent decrease in miR-451 and an

increase in 14-3-3ζ over time (Fig. 1E and 1F). A similar inverse relationship between
miR-451 and 14-3-3ζ was observed in other tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells selected in our
laboratory (data not presented).
Overexpression or knock-down of miR-451 impacts 14-3-3ζ, cell proliferation and colony
formation, apoptosis and sensitivity to SERMs
To further investigate miR-451 regulation of 14-3-3ζ, we overexpressed miR-451 by
transfecting pri-miRNA into MCF7 and TamR cells and monitored mRNA and protein levels
of 14-3-3ζ by qPCR and Western blot. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, overexpression of
miR-451 greatly reduced the level of 14-3-3ζ in both cell lines. We also examined the
specificity of miR-451 action for targeting only 14-3-3ζ and not other 14-3-3 family
members, and found that only 14-3-3ζ was significantly affected by expression of miR-451
(Fig. 2C).

Author Manuscript

We next examined the impact of miR-451 status on proliferation and apoptosis of breast
cancer cells resistant to Tam, by either overexpressing or knocking-down miR-451. As
shown in Fig. 3A, Tam acted as an agonist in TamR cells, enhancing the proliferation of
these cells over vehicle control. Cells transfected with miR-451 showed greatly reduced
proliferation and notably, this suppressive effect of miR-451 on proliferation was reversed
by expression of 14-3-3ζ (Fig. 3A). Also, knock-down of miR-451 (miR-451 KD) by
treatment of cells with miR-451 antagomir, which suppressed endogenous miR-451 and
increased 14-3-3ζ levels (Fig. 3B), increased cell proliferation (Fig. 3C). To determine the
impact of 14-3-3ζ alone on cell viability, we down-regulated its expression by siRNA and
observed a significant decrease in basal and tamoxifen-stimulated cell proliferation. (Fig
3D). Overexpression of miR-451, which reduced 14-3-3ζ without affecting ERα protein or
mRNA levels (Fig. 3F), resulted in suppression of the growth of TamR cells in the presence
of the SERMs tamoxifen or Raloxifene, or Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) (Fig. 3E). After
overexpression of miR-451, we also observed a marked reduction in anchorage-independent
colony formation of TamR cells, i.e. a significant decrease in number and size of colonies in
the vehicle and Tam-treated cells, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor-like activity of
this miR (Fig. 3G).

Author Manuscript

To understand the basis of the reduced cell viability and colony formation in cells
overexpressing miR-451, we monitored 14-3-3ζ, CASP7, and cleaved CASP7 protein upon
Tam treatment. As seen in Fig. 4A, we observed greatly reduced 14-3-3ζ protein with
miR-451 overexpression, as expected, and also elevated levels of CASP7 and cleaved
CASP7. When 14-3-3ζ was re-expressed in cells overexpressing miR-451, the CASP7 and
cleaved CASP7 levels were greatly decreased, becoming comparable to the low levels seen
in control cells, indicating that miR-451, through altering intracellular14-3-3ζ, not only
inhibits proliferation as shown in Fig. 3, but also stimulates the apoptotic cascade. These
changes were also reflected in the marked increase in the proportion of cells in the sub-G1
phase of the cell cycle with miR-451 overexpression (Fig. 4B). There also was a great
increase in the percent of apoptotic cells, rising from 2 to 13% and from 5 to 24% in vehicle
or Tam treated cells, respectively (Fig.4B). The proportion of cells in the sub-G1 phase of

the cell cycle, and the percent of apoptotic cells were significantly reduced when 14-3-3ζ
was re-expressed in cells overexpressing miR-451 (Fig. 4B and C).
Elevated levels of miR-451 reduce the activation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases
and protein kinases
Because endocrine resistance is often associated with the up-regulation of growth factor
receptor and protein kinase signaling, we evaluated the effects of 14-3-3ζ and miR-451 on
the activation of some growth factor receptors and kinases. We observed a significant
increase in phosphorylation of HER2, EGFR, AKT and MAPK upon 14-3-3ζ
overexpression (Fig. 5A). We also examined the impact of miR-451 on these receptors and
downstream signaling pathways, and observed that levels of phosphoHER2 and
phosphoEGFR were greatly reduced in cells overexpressing miR-451, and pMAPK was also
decreased, although only slight reduction was observed in pAKT (Fig. 5B).

Selective action of miR-451 on 14-3-3ζ controls cell proliferation
To further delineate the importance of 14-3-3ζ in the actions of miR-451, we used a
selective 14-3-3ζ target protector to examine the specificity of miR-451 action. Of the 14
targets for miR-451 predicted by the TargetScan algorithm, we found eight to be expressed
in MCF7 cells. Knockdown of endogenous miR-451 increased only the level of 14-3-3ζ
(Fig. 6A). However, with high overexpression of miR-451, 14-3-3ζ was down-regulated
along with two other factors, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and cyclin dependent N-kinase
2D (CDKN2D) (Fig. 6A).

Author Manuscript

As shown in Fig. 6B, in control cells, tamoxifen only upregulated 14-3-3ζ, and had no effect
on OGT or CDKN2D. These observations suggest that OGT and CDKN2D are less sensitive
to miR-451 and, unlike 14-3-3ζ, are not suppressed by endogenous levels of this miR. To
examine whether 14-3-3 ζ was primarily responsible for the impact of miR-451 on cellular
behavior, we utilized an RNA binding antisense oligonucleotide specific for the interaction
between miR-451 and the 3’UTR of 14-3-3ζ (target protector), so as to disrupt only this
interaction. We monitored the levels of 14-3-3ζ, OGT, and CDKN2D in cells
overexpressing miR-451, or 14-3-3ζ protector alone, or both combined (Fig. 6B).
Overexpression of miR-451 reduced the expression of all three, but the addition of the
14-3-3ζ protector in miR-451 overexpressing cells restored the basal level and tamoxifen
response of only 14-3-3ζ, reversing the effect of miR-451 overexpression. By contrast, there
was no effect of the protector on OGT and CDKN2D with miR-451 overexpression. In cells
exposed to 14-3-3ζ protector alone, there was an increase in the basal (Veh) level of 14-3-3ζ
but no effect on OGT or CDKN2D, as would be expected from reduction in the effect of
endogenous miR-451 on 14-3-3ζ.
We then examined the effect of these perturbations on the growth of TamR cells (Fig. 6C).
As shown previously in Fig. 3, miR-451 knock-down increased 14-3-3ζ and cell
proliferation whereas miR-451 overexpression suppressed both basal and tamoxifenstimulated proliferation, and these were restored to the levels in control (Ctrl) cells by copresence of the 14-3-3ζ protector (Fig. 6C). The protector alone raised the proliferation rate
of vehicle (Veh) treated cells, consistent with its effect on the endogenous 14-3-3ζ level,

shown in Fig. 6B, left panel. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that the
effects of both up and down regulation of miR-451 on cell proliferation and response to
tamoxifen are mediated principally by miR-451 regulation of 14-3-3ζ levels. Our overall
findings, schematically depicted in the model in Fig. 7, show that tamoxifen decreases
endogenous miR-451, thereby increasing the level of 14-3-3ζ. 14-3-3ζ promotes breast
cancer cell proliferation and survival and receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR, HER2) activation
and protein kinase signaling while suppressing apoptosis, all of which support the
progression to endocrine resistance.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

The development of resistance to endocrine therapy is a severe limitation in the treatment of
hormone-receptor positive breast tumors. In this study, we provide evidence for a novel
mechanism by which tamoxifen controls 14-3-3ζ levels through its regulation of the
microRNA, miR-451. It is becoming increasingly clear that miRNAs have a profound
impact on many pathologic and physiologic processes, including proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis (Bartel 2004, Harfe 2005), by dampening the expression of
target genes and thereby affording finely tuned cellular regulation. Lowered mRNA levels
appear to be the predominant mode of miR regulation, although decreased translational
efficiency often contributes to reduced protein output as well (Guo et al 2010).

Author Manuscript

Our previous studies described the up-regulation of 14-3-3ζ by tamoxifen and revealed that
high expression of 14-3-3ζ in primary breast cancers was associated with a poor clinical
outcome on tamoxifen (Frasor et al 2006). 14-3-3ζ, which is harbored in a region of frequent
genomic gain (8q23), is overexpressed in greater than 40% of breast tumors (Neal et al
2009) and is overexpressed also in other types of aggressive solid tumors, such as lung
cancer (Li et al 2008). Thus, 14-3-3ζ has properties of an oncogene, yet surprisingly, its
regulation in breast cancer has been largely unknown.

Author Manuscript

It is of note that the regulation of 14-3-3ζ and miR-451 is selective for tamoxifen and is not
brought about by other ER ligands tested, including the estrogen estradiol or the
antiestrogens raloxifene and ICI 182,780, highlighting the remarkable ability of distinct ERligand complexes to selectively affect the transcription of specific genes (Frasor et al 2004,
Frasor et al 2006, Katzenellenbogen and Katzenellenbogen 2002, Katzenellenbogen et al
1996, Shang and Brown 2002). In all cases we examined, we observed an inverse
relationship between miR-451 and 14-3-3ζ, implying the importance of this miRNA in the
regulation of 14-3-3ζ. This regulation of miR-451 by tamoxifen was also highly selective, as
tamoxifen did not affect the nearby miR-144. The differential regulation of miR-451 and
14-3-3ζ by tamoxifen vs. raloxifene is reminiscent of other differences also observed by us
previously when genome-wide gene expression comparison analyses of these two SERMs
were performed (Frasor et al 2004). These differential effects of the two SERMs in
regulation of miR-451 and 14-3-3ζ may underlie some differences in their activities
observed in the STAR (Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene) breast cancer prevention trial
(Dunn and Ford 2001, Vogel et al 2006, Vogel et al 2010).

Previous reports have noted that miR-451 is very highly conserved among vertebrates, and
that its maturation is independent of Dicer (Yang et al 2010). Moreover, miR-451 has been
shown recently to play a crucial role in erythrocyte differentiation by targeting 14-3-3ζ
(Dore et al 2008, Masaki et al 2007, Patrick et al 2010, Yu et al 2010). Expression of
miR-451 has also been detected in normal gastric mucosa and found to be decreased in
gastric cancer (Bandres et al 2009). These findings imply that miR-451 is required for the
development and maintenance of normal tissues (Williams et al 2007) and may be downregulated during the progression to cancer. Of note, we found that our less aggressive cell
line (MCF7) showed higher expression of miR-451 compared to the more aggressive
tamoxifen resistant cell line. We have also observed up-regulation of 14-3-3ζ and downregulation of miR-451 by tamoxifen in ER-positive, HER2-positive BT474 cells (data not
presented). Therefore, the loss of miR-451 induced by Tam treatment appears to be an
underlying mechanism by which ER-positive breast cancer cells become resistant to
tamoxifen therapy by upregulation of 14-3-3ζ. As supporting evidence for this, we show that
reduction of miR-451 by tamoxifen treatment or knock-down of miR-451 by a specific
antagomir increased 14-3-3ζ and cell survival, whereas increasing miR-451 could resensitize
TamR cells to SERMs, as observed by the decrease in cell viability and suppression of
anchorage-independent growth that correlated with increased apoptosis and reduced EGFR,
HER2 and MAPK signaling in tamoxifen treated miR-451 overexpressing cells. This
sensitization of tamoxifen resistant cells to the growth inhibitory effects of Tam and other
antiestrogens by increased expression of miR-451 suggests that restoration of expression of
this miRNA in endocrine therapy-resistant cancer cells might have important implications
for effective breast cancer treatment.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we document miR-451 to be a potent suppressor of the progression to
tamoxifen resistance through its ability to target 14-3-3ζ, a key proliferative and
antiapoptotic factor in breast cancer. Modulation of miR-451 status impacted growth,
apoptosis, receptor tyrosine kinase activity and sensitivity to SERMs. We identify miR-451
as a target of the ER-tamoxifen complex and show an inverse correlation between cellular
miR-451 and 14-3-3ζ levels. Collectively, these data imply that increasing the level of
miR-451 may have beneficial therapeutic effects in the large proportion of breast cancers
expressing high levels of 14-3-3ζ. Progress in microRNA-directed therapeutic approaches
(Lowery et al 2008, Shan et al 2008) offers hope that such strategies might prove useful in
reversing endocrine resistance and reducing breast cancer recurrence.

Fig. 7. Schematic representation of the effect of tamoxifen on miR-451 and 14-3-3ζ regulation
and their impact on breast cancer cell phenotypic properties leading to tamoxifen resistance

Tamoxifen down-regulates miR-451, resulting in the up-regulation of 14-3-3ζ, with
consequent increased receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, increased cell proliferation and
colony formation, and reduced apoptosis, thereby leading to tamoxifen resistance.
