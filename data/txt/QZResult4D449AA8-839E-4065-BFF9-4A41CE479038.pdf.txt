Abstract
Chemotherapy and immunotherapy are the main remedies used in
cancer treatment. Because immunotherapy can not only reduce the toxicity of
chemotherapeutics but also enhance antitumor effects in vivo, combining these
two therapies is a trend that continues to gain more attention in clinic. SEP, a
polysaccharide isolated from Strongylocentrotus nudus egg, has been reported to
display antitumor activity by stimulating immune cells, including NK and T cells,
via TLR2 and TLR4. In the present study, the synergistic effect between SEP and
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a traditional cytotoxic drug, in vitro and in vivo was investigated.
The results obtained indicated that SEP alone stimulated NK-92 cytotoxicity and
coordinated with 5-FU to augment the cytotoxicity of NK-92 cells against HepG-2
or A549 cells in vitro. SEP promoted NK-92 activity by stimulating NKG2D and its
downstream DAP10/PI3K/Erk signaling pathway. Additionally, 5-FU could increase
MICA expression on HepG-2 or A549 cells and prevent membrane MICA from shedding
as soluble MICA, which were abrogated in the tumor cells transfected with ADAM 10
overexpression plasmid. Moreover, in H22- or Lewis lung cancer (LLC)-bearing mouse
models, SEP reversed 5-FU-induced atrophy and apoptosis in both the spleen and
bone marrow in vivo by suppressing ROS generation and caspase-3 activation. All of
these results highlight the potential for the combination of SEP and 5-FU in cancer
therapy in the future.

Introduction

hand, on the premise of maintaining the antitumor effect
of chemotherapy drugs, immunotherapy can weaken
chemotherapy-induced immune injury [4]. On the other
hand, based on the immune effects of chemotherapy drugs,
synergy between chemotherapy and immunotherapy has
indeed been seen in several clinical trails; for example,
an obvious outcome of gemcitabine combined with
IL-2 treatment was observed in patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer [5, 6]. In these studies, chemotherapy
was found to be immunomodulatory, enhance the cross-

Cytotoxic chemotherapy is an effective treatment
for cancer. Unfortunately, using cytotoxic agents not only
exhibited toxicities towards normal tissues, including the
development of hematopoietic and immune suppression,
but also led to the occurrence of drug-resistant tumor
cells [1, 2]. Recently, the combination of chemotherapy
and immunotherapy has received more attention and has
increasingly been used in clinical practice [3]. On one

presentation of tumor antigens, and make cytotoxic
CTL/NK cells more susceptible to tumor cells despite their
immunosuppressive effects [5–7].
Strongylocentrotus nudus eggs polysaccharide
(SEP) is an immunostimulating agent. Our previous
research has revealed that SEP has a protective effect
on cyclophosphamide (Cy)-treated mice against
myelosuppression and inhibits tumor growth in vivo by
activating the immune system, including stimulating the
cytotoxicity of T cells and NK cells [8–10]. However, the
synergistic effect between SEP and chemotherapy has not
yet been investigated. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a general
antimetabolite chemotherapy drug, is widely used in
treatment of cancer in the clinic and exhibits suppressive
effects on the immune system, including leukopenia and
atrophy of hematopoietic organs [11–13]. Moreover,
5-FU is immunomodulatory and has been combined with
cytokines in the clinic [14]. An adjuvant combination
therapy approach including 5-FU and IFN-α has achieved
an overall 5-year survival of 55% in a phase II clinical trial
of pancreatic adenocarcinoma [14]. Therefore, the effect of
SEP and 5-FU was further investigated in the present study.
The combined antitumor activity of 5-FU and SEP
in vitro and in vivo was studied. In vitro, SEP directly
stimulated NK-92 cytotoxicity through the upregulation
of NKG2D expression and activation of the downstream
DAP10/PI3K/Erk signaling pathway. Moreover, 5-FU
increased and maintained membrane MICA (the ligand of
NKG2D) expression on tumor cells through the inhibition
of ADAM10. As a result, synergy of SEP and 5-FU
enhanced the cytotoxicity of NK-92 cells toward HepG-2
or A549 cells in vitro. Furthermore, in H22- or Lewis
Lung Cancer (LLC)-bearing mouse models, SEP not only
enhanced the antitumor activity of 5-FU (medium dose)
but also reversed the 5-FU-induced apoptosis of cells
from both the bone marrow and spleen by reducing
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and caspase-3
activation. These results indicated that the combined
therapy of SEP and 5-FU could be a potential strategy for
cancer treatment in the future.

approximately 50 μg/mL. Therefore, 20 μg/mL of
5-FU, approximately half of the IC50 value, was used in
the following experiment. Co-culture of NK-92 cells
pretreated with SEP (200 μg/mL, 24 h) and HepG-2 or
A549 cells pretreated with 5-FU (20 μg/mL, 24 h) resulted
in significantly enhanced NK cytotoxicity against both
cancer cell lines (Figure 1C and 1D). Compared with the
control groups, the NK lysis rates of HepG-2 cells in the
SEP and 5-FU treated group was increased by 17.32%,
20.53%, and 27.73% at E:T (effector and target) ratios
of 1:1, 5:1 and 10:1, respectively. Similar results were
obtained in A549 cells with NK cytotoxicity increased to
13.42%, 29.83%, and 44.75% at E:T ratios of 1:1, 5:1 and
10:1, respectively (Figure 1D).

SEP activates NK-92 cells through the NKG2D
pathway
Recent studies have shown that NKG2D is one of
the most important stimulatory receptors expressed on NK
cells, and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) is the most
common signaling mediator downstream of NKG2D [15].
Furthermore, the PI3K-ERK pathway has been shown to
play an important role in NK cell activation and cytotoxicity
[16, 17]. Thus, we hypothesized that SEP first promotes
the expression of NKG2D receptors and then activates
the downstream DAP10/PI3K/Erk pathway, leading to
the activation of NK cells. To confirm this hypothesis,
we first examined if activation of NK cells by SEP was
mediated by NKG2D. As presented in Figure 2A, 2B,
NKG2D expression on NK-92 cells was up-regulated in
the SEP-treated groups.
Additionally, the activation of DAP10 and
phosphorylation of Akt and Erk were observed in the SEPtreated NK-92 cells (Figure 2C–2F), which were impaired
by the NK-92 cells pretreated with NKG2D neutralizing
antibody (Figure 2G–2J). Specifically, when the cells
pretreated with anti-NKG2D and further inoculated with
SEP, the level of DAP10 and the phosphorylation of PI3K
and ERK were decreased by 18.2%, 31.1% and 35.4%,
respectively, compared with the cells treated with isotype
antibody and SEP. The results mentioned above suggested
that SEP facilitated the function of NK cells via the
NKG2D/DAP10/PI3K/Erk pathway.

RESULTS
SEP directly stimulates the activity of NK-92
cells and, coordinated with 5-FU, augments the
cytotoxic effect of NK-92 cells against tumor cells

5-FU up-regulates and maintains MICA
expression on tumor cells

The effect of SEP on the activity of NK-92 cells
was measured first. As shown in Figure 1A, the specific
lysis of K562 cells was enhanced in the SEP-treated
groups, indicating that SEP could directly stimulate NK
cell cytotoxicity in vitro. We then measured the potential
of SEP and 5-FU to augment the cytotoxicity of NK-92
cells against HepG-2 or A549 cells. The results of Figure 1B
indicated that the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)
of 5-FU on both HepG-2 and A549 cells at 24 h was

It is well known that MICA and MICB, which are
the ligands of NKG2D and expressed on tumor cells,
are important molecules for stimulating the cytoxicity
of immune cells, and MICA can easily fall off to soluble
MICA (sMICA), which inhibits the activity of NK cells
[18, 19]. Therefore, the effect of 5-FU on MICA expression
of tumor cells was studied further. 5-FU increased and
maintained membrane MICA/MICB expression on

HepG-2 and A549 cells within 24 h (Figure 3A–3D).
Additionally, sMICA in the culture supernatants of
HepG-2 and A549 cells treated with 5-FU for 24 h were
decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3E, 3F).
Meanwhile, 5-FU suppressed the expression of ADAM 10,
which promoted MICA shedding, in both HepG-2 and
A549 cells (Figure 3G–3J). Moreover, when ADAM 10
was overexpressed in these tumor cells, the 5-FU-induced
the upregulation of MICA expression and downregulation
of sMICA secretion were both attenuated (Figure 3K–3N).
Compared with the cells in the vehicle group treated with
5-FU, the sMICA secretion was increased by 65.4% and
46.9% in the HepG-2 and A549 cells transfected in ADAM
10 overexpression plasmid treated with 5-FU, respectively.
Therefore, the inhibition of ADAM10 induced by 5-FU
could one of the mechanisms utilized for inducing and
maintaining MICA expression on tumor cells.

Because SEP and 5-FU treatment synergistically
stimulates NK activity to kill tumor cells in vitro, the
antitumor effect of the combination therapy was further
studied in vivo by establishing H22- or LLC-bearing
mouse models. Compared with 5-FU treatment alone, cotreatment of SEP and 5-FU significantly suppressed tumor
growth in these two models (Figure 4A, 4D). As presented
in Figure 2A, in H22-bearing mice, tumor weights in
the combined therapy group were obviously decreased
relative to the 6.25 or 12.5 mg/kg 5-FU (quarter or half
of the highest dose) alone treated group. Specifically,
the tumor inhibitory rate reached 75.88% in the 5-FU
(12.5 mg/kg) combined with SEP (10 mg/kg) group
(Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained in LLC-bearing

mice. The tumor inhibitory rate in the 5-FU combined
with SEP 12.5 + 10 mg/kg group was increased by 36.30%
compared with the 12.5 mg/kg 5-FU group (Figure 4D)
and was the same as that of the 25 mg/kg 5-FU group.
Moreover, as shown in Figure 4C and 4F, H&E staining of
tumor tissues in each group shows that the necrotic regions
in the combination group (5-FU + SEP) were larger than
those in the 5-FU-alone treated group.
The curves demonstrated that the body weights were
obviously decreased as the dosage of 5-FU increased in
both tumor-bearing models, whereas in the combined
therapy of 5-FU and SEP, the body weight losses were

reduced (Figure 4B, 4E). The results described above
suggest that, in combination therapy-treated H22- or LLCbearing mice, SEP not only improved the antitumor activity
of 5-FU but also reduced the body loss induced by 5-FU.

To evaluate the effects of combination therapy on
immune organs, we examined changes in the spleen and
thymus in these two models. 5-FU-induced decreases in

In H22-bearing mice, the spleen and thymus indices in the
5-FU combined with SEP group (25 + 10 mg/kg) were
elevated 1.58- and 2.21-fold compared to those of the
25 mg/kg 5-FU group, respectively (Figure 5A, 5C).
Similar results were observed in the LLC-bearing mice,
the spleen and thymus indices in the 5-FU combined with
SEP were both up-regulated and were similar to those in
the model group (Figure 5E, 5G). In H&E staining of the
spleens and thymus tissues shown, compared with the 5-FU
group, the atrophy degrees in SEP combined with the 5-FUtreated groups were alleviated (Figure 5B, 5D, 5F, and 5H).
These results suggested that SEP could reverse the atrophy

protective effect on the hematopoietic function of bone
marrow inhibited by 5-FU.

SEP prevents 5-FU-induced apoptosis in
splenocytes and bone marrow cells in vivo
As shown in Figure 7, 5-FU can induce the
apoptosis of splenocytes and bone marrow cells in H22- or
LLC-bearing mouse models, but after treatment combined
with SEP, the apoptosis of these cells was significantly
inhibited.
Since ROS generation and caspase-3 activation are
vital factors in 5-FU-induced apoptotic effects, both ROS
secretion and caspase-3 expression in the spleen and bone
marrow were detected further. In H22- or LLC-bearing
mouse models, 5-FU stimulated both ROS secretion and
cleaved caspase-3 expression of splenocytes and bone
marrow cells in vivo (Figures 8 and 9). Whereas in the
combination group of SEP combined with every dose
of 5-FU, the expression levels of both ROS and cleaved
caspase-3 were significantly decreased (Figures 8 and 9).

SEP impairs 5-FU-induced suppression of
hematopoietic functions in bone marrow in vivo
To evaluate the hematopoietic function of the
bone marrow, we counted the leukocytes, erythrocytes,
reticulocytes and platelets from the peripheral blood
and CD34+ cells from the bone marrow in each group.
As shown in Tables 1 and 2, in both tumor-bearing
mouse models, the numbers of leukocytes, erythrocytes,
reticulocytes and platelets as well as the percentage of
CD34+ cells were elevated remarkably in combined
therapy of SEP and 5-FU groups compared to 5-FUtreated group. In H22-bearing mouse models at the high
dose of 25 mg/kg of 5-FU, the number of hematopoietic
function-related cells were significantly decreased, and
these cells were recovered to numbers similar to those
in the model group after treatment with both 25 mg/kg
5-FU and10 mg/kg SEP (Table 1). Additionally, in LLCbearing mouse models, the leukocytes, erythrocytes,
reticulocytes, platelets and CD34+ cells in the 5-FU and
SEP combined group (25 + 10 mg/kg) were 3.43-, 1.44,
1.60-, 9.00- and 1.67-fold compared to the 25 mg/kg 5-FU
group (Table 2). H&E staining of femurs indicated that
the decrease of hematopoietic cells in each co-treated
group was attenuated compared to the relative 5-FU-alone
treated group (Figure 6), suggesting that SEP exhibited a

DISCUSSION
A combinatory approach of using both
chemotherapy and immuno-therapy is a research hotspot
for treating cancer in the clinic because immunotherapy
can reduce the immune damage induced by chemotherapy,
and the combination of chemo- and immunotherapy
exhibits a synergistic antitumor effect [20, 21]. Our
previous research has found that SEP inhibits tumor
growth in vivo by stimulating immune cells, including
T and NK cells [8–10]. Additionally, 5-FU is a widely
used chemotherapy agent for cancer therapy in the
clinic. Despite the immunosuppressive effects of 5-FU,
several research studies have investigated the effect of
5-FU combined with an immunoregulatory agent, such
as IL-12 and IL-15 [21, 22]. In this study, the effect of
the combination therapy of SEP and 5-FU on antitumor
activity and immune and hematopoietic systems were
investigated in vitro and in vivo.

As is known, NK cells are important components of
the innate immune response and contribute substantially
to the antitumor immune response [23]. As our previous
research reported [8], SEP not only inhibited tumor
growth, but also promoted NK-mediated cytotoxicity

and enhanced the NK1.1+ cell population in LLCbearing mice. Moreover, SEP significantly suppressed
human NSCLC H460 growth in nude mice, which was
abrogated by the selective depletion of NK cells via the
intraperitoneal injection of anti-asialo GM-1 antibodies.

Therefore, SEP-enhanced NK cytotoxicity is crucial and
that NK cells is a unique SEP target in tumor-bearing
mice. In this study, the data obtained in vitro indicated
that SEP could directly enhance the cytotoxicity of NK-92
cells against K-562 cells. It has been reported that NK
cell activity is controlled by a balance of signals derived
from inhibitory and activating receptors, and one of the
most powerful activating receptors expressed by NK cells
is NKG2D, which can recognize stress-induced ligands
that appear on the surface of tumor cells [24, 25]. NKG2D
associates with the adaptor protein DAP10, which contains
a YINM-sequence signaling motif [26, 27]. After receptor
stimulation, the tyrosine is phosphorylated, and PI3K
and a Grb2-Vav1 complex were consequently activated,
leading to the downstream activation of Akt and MAP
kinases, respectively [26, 28]. In this study, the expression
of NKG2D on NK-92 cells was up-regulated in the SEPtreated group. Moreover, the increased DAP10 activation
and Akt and Erk phosphorylation were also observed after
SEP treatment and these phenomena were attenuated after
anti-NKG2D treatment. Thus, SEP might first increase
the NKG2D/DAP10 complex in NK-92 cells and then
stimulate the downstream phosphorylation of Akt and Erk
and thereby activate NK cytotoxicity.
NKG2D ligands mainly include MHC class I chainrelated A and B (MICA/B) molecules and UL16-binding
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proteins (ULBPs) 1–6 [29–31]. In contrast to classic MHC
class I molecules, MICA/B are rarely expressed on normal
cells but are frequently expressed on tumor cells [32–34].
The engagement of MICA/B and NKG2D strongly
activates NK cells and co-stimulates T cells, enhancing
their cytolytic activity and cytokine production [35].
Thus, the MICA/B-NKG2D pathway is an important
mechanism by which the host immune system recognizes
and kills transformed cells [36]. In addition to those
membrane-bound forms, MICA/B molecules are also
cleaved proteolytically from tumor cells and appear as
soluble forms in the sera of patients with malignancies
[37–39]. Soluble MICA/B in circulation down-regulates
NKG2D expression and disturbs NKG2D-mediated
antitumor immunity, and as a result, tumor cells escape
from NKG2D-mediated immuno-surveillance [40].
Additionally, ADAM10 is involved in the switch
between membrane-bound and soluble MICA. ADAM10
knockdown resulted in increased expression of membranebound MICA, decreased production of soluble MICA, and
enhanced NK sensitivity of tumor cells [34, 41]. It has
been reported 5-FU could regulate the MICA expression
on A549 cells [42]. Similarly, we are also delighted to
find out that 5-FU not only induced membrane MICA
expression on HepG-2 and A549 cells, but also inhibited
MICA shedding as sMICA, which was mediated by

inhibiting the expression of ADAM10, and that SEP
promoted the expression of NKG2D on NK-92 cells and
then activated the downstream DAP10/PI3K/Erk pathway,
further enhancing the NKG2D-mediated antitumor

immunity of NK cells. Therefore, the coordinative
interaction of SEP and 5-FU on the enhancement of
NK activity against HepG-2 or A549 cells is based on
triggering the interaction between NKG2D and MICA.

Considering the combined therapeutic effect of
5-FU and SEP in vitro, the antitumor activity of these two
drugs is further studied in vivo by establishing H22- or
LLC-bearing mouse models. The data obtained indicated
that SEP remarkably enhanced the antitumor activity
of 5-FU. In 5-FU (12.5 mg/kg, half of the high dose)
combined with SEP (10 mg/kg) group, tumor weights
were significantly suppressed, and the tumor inhibitory
rates were obviously elevated and similar to those in
the group treated with 5-FU at high dose (25 mg/kg).
Additionally, body loss in the combination therapy group
was remarkably alleviated compared with that in the 5-FU
alone treated group, indicating that SEP could reduce the
toxicity of 5-FU in vivo.

Immune suppression and atrophy of hematopoietic
organs are the two dominant toxicities related to
5-FU applications in humans and mice [11–13].
Myelosuppression, as a result of inhibitory and cytotoxic
effects on hematopoietic progenitor cells [43] and oxidative
stress on bone marrow [44], limits the clinical application
of 5-FU-based chemotherapies. In this research, SEP
protected the immune system and hematopoietic function
from injury caused by 5-FU, including up-regulating the
indices of the spleen and thymus and reducing the atrophy
of the spleen, thymus, and hematopoietic organs. It has
been reported that 5-FU exerted cytotoxic effects through
inhibiting thymidylate synthetase or incorporation into
RNA and DNA and then promoting apoptosis by inducing

ROS and activating caspase [45]. The result of AnnexinVﬂuorescein (AV) and Propidium iodide (PI) double
staining indicated that SEP decreased the apoptosis of
both splenocytes and bone marrow cells in vivo, which
were induced by 5-FU at each dose. Moreover, compared
with the 5-FU alone treated group, the production of
ROS was down-regulated in SEP and 5-FU combination
treated groups in both splenocytes and bone marrow
cells. It is well known that ROS forms as a natural
byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen and plays
important roles in cell signaling and homeostasis [46].
Moderate levels of ROS may function as signals to
promote cell proliferation and survival, whereas severe
elevation of ROS can damage cells and lipid membranes
of subcellular components, resulting in lipid peroxidation,
DNA damage and cellular apoptosis [47]. Therefore, SEPsuppressed excess ROS production induced by 5-FU is one
of the mechanisms for reducing apoptosis in splenocytes
and bone marrow cells. It has also been reported that
the activation of caspase-3 is downstream of ROS in the
apoptosis program and that the clearance of ROS inhibits
the activation of caspase-3 [46, 48]. Caspase-3 is a member

of the caspase (cysteine aspartic proteinases) family of
enzymes, which, once activated, initiates the cell apoptosis
program [49, 50]. The data obtained revealed that cleaved
caspase-3 was up-regulated after 5-FU administration
and down-regulated in the combination therapy group,
indicating that SEP could suppress the activation of
caspase-3 and then reverse the apoptosis caused by 5-FU
in both spleen and bone marrow tissues. It is possible that
SEP reversed 5-FU induced apoptosis by first suppressing
ROS and then inhibiting caspase-3, thereby protecting the
immune and hematopoietic systems from injury.
Collectively, our findings suggested that SEP
and 5-FU coordinated to enhance the cytolytic activity
of NK cells against tumor cells by stimulating the
interaction between NKG2D and MICA in vitro. SEP
augmented this interaction in vivo and reduced 5-FUinduced immunosuppression and hematopoietic injury by
inhibiting ROS generation and caspase-3 activation. These
results revealed the therapeutic potential of SEP and 5-FU
in cancer treatment and further highlight the strategy of
using an immunoregulatory agent in combination with a
cytotoxic drug in the clinic.

Animals were provided with continuous access to standard
rodent chow and water and housed in a rodent facility at
22 ± 1°C with a 12 h light-dark cycle. All procedures were
conducted in strict accordance with protocols approved by
the Ethics Committee of China Pharmaceutical University.

Killing activity analysis of NK cells
CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay
was performed as described previously [51]. Briefly,
target tumor cells were washed with PBS, resuspended
with fresh NK-92 culture medium, and seeded in a 96well plate at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well. NK-92 cells
were then added with relative effector to target (E:T) ratios
of 10:1, 5:1, and 1:1. After the cells were incubated for
4 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, the
supernatant in each well was harvested and measured by
the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay. The
killing effect of NK cells against target cells was assessed
with the following formula:
cytotoxicity = (experimental - effector spontaneous
− target spontaneous)/(target maximum − target
spontaneous) × 100%.

Cell viability analyses
A549 and HepG-2 cells were harvested, washed
with PBS and supplemented with RPMI-1640 or DMEM
containing 10% fetal calf serum with a density of 5 × 104
cells/mL. Then, 100 μl of cells were seeded in 96-well
plates overnight. The cells were inoculated with 5-FU
(with concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 μg/mL) for 24 h.
Then, the cells were incubated with MTT solution (5 μg/mL)
for 4 h. Next, the cells were lysed, and the purple formazan
crystals were solubilized by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
for detection at 490 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad

ADAM 10 plasmid construction and transfection

cells were treated with 5-FU (with a concentration of
1, 10, or 20 μg/mL) or SEP (with a concentration of 50,
100, or 200 μg/mL), respectively. When the cells incubated
were incubated with drugs for 12 or 24 h, they were
collected and washed with PBS. Next, tumor cells were
incubated with an anti-MICA/B-PE antibody (Miltenyi
Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), and the NK-92
cells were incubated with an anti-NKG2D-PE antibody
(Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The
resulting fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry
analysis using a FACS flow cytometer.

ADAM 10 overexpression plasmid was constructed
by the following methods. The human ADAM10
overexpression plasmid and blank vector were purchased
from Shanghai Jikai Gene company (Shanghai, China).
The transfection of HepG-2 and A549 cells was then
carried out with a Lipofectamine™ 3000 transfection
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with indicated
ADAM10 overexpression plasmid. The cells were
divided equally into three groups as follows: ADAM10
group (ADAM10-overexpressed plasmid group), vehicle
group (blank-Vector-transfected group) and blank group
(no DNA-transfected group). The efficiency of ADAM10
overexpression was evaluated by western-blot after cells
were harvested 24 h post-transfection.
Further, the cells were treated with 5-FU
(20 μg/mL) for another 24 h, harvested and stained with
anti-MICA-PE antibody (R&D Systems, MN, USA) and
analyzed using flow cytometry. In another experiment,
the medium supernatant were collected and the sMICA
production were determined with a human sMICA
ELISA kit.

Measurements of soluble MICA (sMICA)
The effects of 5-FU on sMICA production in the
supernatants of tumor cells were determined with a human
sMICA ELISA kit (R&D Systems, MN, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. HepG-2 and A549
cells (1 × 104 cells) were each placed in each well of a
96-well flat-bottomed microplate and exposed to different
concentrations of 5-FU (ranging from 0.1 to 20 μg/mL)
for 24 h. After incubation, the culture supernatants were
harvested and tested for sMICA by ELISA.

H22- and LLC-bearing mouse models and
administration

Western blot analyses
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer in the presence of
proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Generay, Shanghai, China).
The protein concentration was determined using a BCA
assay (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Protein samples
(20 or 40 μg) were separated on 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE
(whichever was appropriate) and transferred to PVDF
membranes. Then, the membranes were blocked in 1%
BSA solutions for 1 h and incubated overnight with
primary antibodies at 4°C. Next, the membranes were
washed extensively with 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS (TBST)
and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase for 1 hour at 37°C. After washing
with TBST again, the membranes were exposed using
a Pierce(R) fast western blot kit chemiluminescence
substrate. The blots were detected on a Bio-Imaging
System using Quality One 1-D analysis software
(Bio-Rad). All of the blots were stripped and reprobed
using a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody for determining
if the proteins were loaded equally.

H22 ascites and LLC cells (0.1 ml, 5 × 105 cells,
> 98% viability) were transplanted subcutaneously into the
right axilla of ICR or C57/BL6J mice. When the tumor
grew to 100 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into
seven groups with each group containing 10 mice. The
mice were administered drug as follows: model group,
normal saline; three 5-FU alone groups, 6.25, 12.5 or
25 mg/kg body weight of 5-FU; three 5-FU and SEP
combination treatment groups, 6.25, 12.5 or 25 mg/kg
body weight of 5-FU with 10 mg/kg body weight of SEP.
All solutions were dissolved in normal saline, filtered
through a 0.22 μm Millipore filter and administered every
other day. H22-bearing ICR mice were administered by
tail vein injection and LLC-bearing C57/BL6J mice were
administered by intraperitoneal injection. 24 hours after
the last drug administration, peripheral blood samples
were taken and stored at 4°C for further use. Then,
all animals were weighed and sacrificed via cervical
dislocation. The spleen and thymus were immediately
removed and weighed. Femurs of each group were taken
and stored at 4°C for evaluation of hematopoietic function.

Anti-NKG2D antibody blocking experiments
NK-92 cells were pretreated with either a NKG2D
neutralizing antibody (R&D systems, MN, USA) or an
isotype antibody (R&D systems, MN, USA) for 2 h. Then
the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of SEP
(200 μg/ml) for 24 h, collected, lysed and then analyzed
using western blot assay.

were measured at 488 nm for excitation and 525 nm for
emission, and signals of PI were detected at 535 nm for
excitation and 615 nm for emission.
The cell population fractions in different quadrants
were analyzed using quadrant statistics. Early apoptotic
cells and late apoptotic cells were shown in the lower right
(LR) and upper right (UR) quadrants, respectively (13).
The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as follows:
apoptosis rate (%) = (number of apoptotic cells) /
(number of total cells observed) × 100%.

Thymus and spleen indices and histochemical
examinations
The thymus and spleen indices were calculated
as thymus or spleen weight/body weight. The spleens,
thymuses and femurs taken from all groups were fixed
with 10% formalin and embedded with paraffin, and the
sections (4 mm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E). Histological changes were examined by light
microscopy.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay
To determine the effects of ROS generation in
splenocytes and BM-MNCs in each group, we carried out
DCFH-DA assays to measure ROS generation. Briefly,
BM-MNCs and splenocytes were washed and suspended in
100 μl of PBS with DCFH-DA for 40 min. Next, cells were
collected and washed, and then the fluorescence intensity
was measured at 488 nm for excitation and 525 nm
for emission with a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA).

Isolation of bone marrow mononuclear cells
(BM-MNCs) and preparation of splenocytes
BM-MNCs were prepared as described previously
[52]. Briefly, the femora and tibiae were harvested from
mice in each group immediately after euthanization. BM
cells were flushed into PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum
using a 21-gauge and 5 ml syringe. Then, the cells were
centrifuged through Histopaque 1083 to obtain BM-MNCs.
Splenic single cell suspensions were prepared as
previous described [9].

Statistical analyses
The data were analyzed using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s test to
identify any differences between either the control
and combination treatment group or the drug alonetreated groups. The results are presented as the means ±
standard deviations (SD). P-values of less than 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Measurements of leukocytes, erythrocytes,
platelets, and CD34+ cells
Peripheral blood samples of each group were
collected in test tubes with anticoagulants, and leukocytes,
erythrocytes and platelets were counted with an automated
chemical analyzer (COBAS INTEGRA 400 Plus, Roche,
Switzerland).
Hematopoietic cells were collected from femurs
by bone marrow aspiration, washed with PBS and
resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold PBS supplemented
with 1% fetal calf serum, and then, anti-CD34-FITC
monoclonal antibody was added to the suspension. The
cells were incubated for 30 min at 4°C and then washed
and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. CD34+ cells were then
detected by flow cytometry (BD LSR II Analyzer, BD
Biosciences, USA).
