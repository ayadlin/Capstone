Frontline Rituximab Monotherapy Induction Versus a Watch
and Wait Approach for Asymptomatic Advanced-Stage
Follicular Lymphoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
Anca Prica1; Kelvin Chan2; and Matthew Cheung3

BACKGROUND: A watch and wait (WW) strategy is the standard of care for patients with asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular
lymphoma. Recent data have demonstrated an improvement in the time to progression with rituximab induction (RI) with or without
rituximab maintenance (RM) in comparison with a WW strategy wait in such patients. It remains unclear whether this is a costeffective strategy. METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model was developed to compare the clinical outcomes, costs, and costeffectiveness of RI (4 weekly doses) plus RM (12 doses every 2 months), RI (4 weekly doses), and a WW strategy for patients newly
diagnosed with low-burden, asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma over a lifetime horizon. Baseline probabilities and utilities were derived from a systematic review of published studies, and they were evaluated on a 6-month cycle. A Canadian public
health payer’s perspective was adopted, and costs were presented in 2012 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: RI was the cheapest strategy.
It was less costly at $59,953 versus $67,489 for the RM arm and $75,895 for the WW arm. It was also associated with a slightly lower
quality-adjusted life expectancy at 6.16 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus 6.28 QALYs for the RM strategy but was superior to
WW (5.71 QALYs). In sensitivity analyses of key variables, this effectiveness was sensitive to the probability of first and second progression in the RI arm, and this indicated relatively neutral effectiveness between the 2 rituximab arms. CONCLUSIONS: RI without
maintenance for asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma is the preferred strategy: it minimizes costs per patient over a

INTRODUCTION
Follicular lymphoma is the most common incurable indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and constitutes 15% to 30% of
lymphoma diagnoses.1,2 The median survival is 10 years, and this is punctuated by repeated rounds of relapsed disease
and treatment.1 The majority of patients present with advanced disease; however, a large proportion are asymptomatic
and are diagnosed incidentally.
The nature of the disease, with recurrent but progressively shorter relapses, and the lack of a cure have prompted
investigations into the role of immediate chemotherapy in asymptomatic patients. Three randomized controlled trials
have confirmed that there is no detriment to deferred chemotherapy in comparison with upfront treatment with respect to
overall survival.3-5 The median time until the initiation of chemotherapy for symptomatic progression was 2.6 years. Ten
years after diagnosis, 19% of patients had neither required chemotherapy nor died of the disease.5 This established the
watch and wait (WW) strategy as the standard of care in asymptomatic follicular lymphoma.
However, these studies compared upfront cytotoxic regimens with an observation approach. Therapies today are
more effective, especially with the advent of rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, which significantly increases overall survival in symptomatic follicular lymphoma when it is added to standard chemotherapy.6,7 Rituximab monotherapy has
also been clearly shown to have efficacy in follicular lymphoma. Colombat et al8 in a phase 2 trial design demonstrated a
response rate of 73% in untreated patients with a low tumor burden. Thus, it was hypothesized that rituximab targeted
therapy not only could achieve deep responses and delay more aggressive treatment courses but also could potentially

modify the course of disease. A recent large randomized
controlled trial compared upfront rituximab to watchful
waiting for asymptomatic stage II to IV follicular lymphoma; it showed significant improvements in the time to
the initiation of the next treatment and progression-free
survival, but no difference in overall survival was detected
with a short follow-up.9 Both a rituximab induction (RI)–
only strategy and induction with maintenance were compared. Frontline rituximab was additionally associated
with an improvement in quality of life 7 months after diagnosis, with minimal difference between the 2 early
intervention arms.9
Single-agent rituximab is less expensive and is associated with fewer side effects than combination immunochemotherapy administered for symptomatic disease;
thus, there are potential advantages to the upfront use of
rituximab in deferring possible further treatment. Conversely, a proportion of asymptomatic patients might
never require treatment and die of other causes unrelated
to their follicular lymphoma.5
We developed a Markov decision analysis model to
determine the cost-effectiveness of RI and rituximab
maintenance (RM) versus RI and a WW approach in
patients with low-burden, asymptomatic advanced-stage
follicular lymphoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Model Structure

A Markov decision analysis model was developed to compare upfront RI followed by RM to RI and to a WW strategy in patients with newly diagnosed, untreated, lowburden, asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma. The age of the base case cohort of patients entered
into the model was 60 years, which is the average age of
patients with follicular lymphoma.5,10 A low burden was
defined as fewer than 3 nodal areas, each more than 3 cm,
and no nodal or extranodal mass > 7 cm.4 The RM regimen consisted of intravenous rituximab at 375 mg/m2
weekly for 4 weeks followed by 12 infusions of the same
dose every 2 months for 2 years. The RI regimen consisted
of intravenous rituximab at 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4
weeks, at which point patients entered a follow-up period
regardless of their response to the treatment. The WW
strategy involved patients being followed clinically every 3
to 6 months until progression requiring treatment, as
defined by the Groupe d’Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires criteria.4
Patients with progression were modeled to receive
treatment with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for 6
2638

cycles as previously published,11 and this was followed by
RM at 375 mg/m2 every 2 months for 2 years.12 After the
completion of BR, patients entered a long-term follow-up
stage. Patients who did not respond to BR or relapsed after therapy then received rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone,
or fludarabine-based chemotherapy at the physician’s discretion with practice patterns defined by the literature.13
Patients could receive up to 3 further lines of treatment,
after which they entered a palliative state that eventually
led to death.
A Markov state transition model was used to project
the lifetime prognosis of patients according to the induction strategy used. The model consisted of a number of
health states: progression-free 1 (PF1); RM in PF1 (the 2year state of being progression-free after RI and receiving
rituximab every 2 months); progressive disease 1 (PD1;
defined as needing treatment); BR treatment (6 months);
RM in PF2 (the 2-year state of being progression-free after
BR and receiving rituximab every 2 months); subsequent
progression-free states; and progression states leading to
salvage treatment, palliation, and death. The probabilities
of transitioning between states were evaluated on a 6month cycle for a lifetime horizon of 30 years. In each
cycle, depending on their health state, patients were at risk
of dying from follicular lymphoma, the treatments (BR,
rituximab monotherapy, and salvage chemotherapy), or
natural causes. Figure 1 illustrates a simplified model of
the Markov transition states. Outcomes for the baseline
analysis were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a
cost-utility analysis expressed as an incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER; cost per QALY). One-way sensitivity analyses were performed for key variables with the
quality-adjusted model (Fig. 2). Ranges used for the
treatment-related variables were clinically plausible
according to the literature and cost sources. Probabilistic
sensitivity analyses (1000 simulations) were performed
with distributions identified from the data. Gamma distributions were used to model cost variables, and beta distributions were used to model probability variables. TreeAge
Pro 2013 software was used to construct the model and
perform the analyses.
Key Assumptions

Several assumptions were made with respect to treatment
options, the course of disease, and costs:
1. All patients were eligible for treatment upon PD1.
2. All patients were treated with BR and MR upon PD1.

3. Conservatively, the probability of responding to BR
was modeled as 5% lower if the initial strategy was RM
or RI versus WW.
4. Patients were treated with a maximum of 3 lines of salvage therapy, after which they entered palliation for a
maximum of 2 cycles.
5. No patients underwent autologous or allogeneic stem
cell transplantation.
6. Quality-of-life detriments were applied for the first 6month cycle to the WW and rituximab-based arms
according to the trial by Ardeshna et al.9 Sensitivity
analyses were performed for the key assumptions.
Baseline Estimates

The baseline estimates of the model treatment variables
were derived from key randomized controlled trials in the
field (Table 1). A systematic review of the literature was
conducted to identify the available evidence comparing
RI to the WW approach as our main comparison for this
model. There was only 1 randomized controlled trial
comparing the strategies.9 Four other single-arm phase 2
trials of RI were also identified.14-17
Transition probabilities were adjusted to every 6month probabilities because of the cycle length of the
model. Utility values were identified from the literature
(Table 1).22 Costs were considered from the health care
system’s perspective as direct medical costs only (Table 2).
Transition Probabilities

The probabilities of progressing from PF1 to PD1 were
modeled on the basis of data published by Ardeshna et al.
and the British National Lymphoma Investigation.5,9 The

plausible range of the transition probabilities of progression as reported in the literature was explored in sensitivity
analyses. The probability of death during the progressionfree health state was the age-related mortality per 6month cycle as identified from Statistics Canada life
tables.18
The trial by Rummel et al11 comparing BR to RCHOP described the overall response rate (ORR) to BR
as 93%. It is not known whether previous rituximab exposure leads to a lower ORR to subsequent immunochemotherapy (because of increased resistance to this therapy).
To be conservative, we modeled a lower ORR to BR of
88% in individuals who received RI. The probability of
death while a patient was on treatment was 0.4% per
treatment course (6 months).11
The probability of PD2 after BR according to Rummel et al’s trial11 was 6.8% per 6-month cycle. However,
this trial was performed without RM. On the basis of the
landmark PRIMA trial, we chose to adjust the PD2 probability of Rummel et al’s study by the hazard ratio for progression on RM versus observation (hazard ratio, 0.60). It
is possible that a progression-free survival benefit derived
from maintenance therapy is not similarly preserved after
bendamustine, which has not been tested in clinical trials.
We explored this possibility in sensitivity analyses.
The probabilities of PF3/4/5 from PD2/3/4 were
modeled on the basis of the study by van Oers et al,19 who
reported an ORR of 85% with second-line therapy. We
applied a penalty of 20% to the ORR with each subsequent line of salvage therapy, but we explored this further
in sensitivity analyses. For this model, the probability of
reprogression from PF3/4/5 was assumed to be
constant.19
Utilities

A utility score representing health-related quality of life
was assigned to each health state in the model on the basis
of published values (Table 1)21 and an unpublished British study that used the EQ-5D instrument to assess the
quality of life in patients with follicular lymphoma; these
utilities have been widely used in follicular lymphoma
cost-effectiveness analyses.20,31,32 Ardeshna et al9 demonstrated improved quality of life at 7 months in both RM
and RI arms versus a WW arm; however, utility scores
cannot be derived from the presented data. There was also
a small difference between the RM and RI arms in the
Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale.9 For the first cycle of
the model (6 months), on the basis of the scores presented,
we applied a 6% detriment to the RI utility and a 16%
detriment to the WW utility.9

Supportive drug costs were derived from hospital pharmacies. Unit costs for medical visits and laboratory and
radiologic tests were based on the Ontario schedules of

human resources departments. Resource utilization and
overhead costs were based on published guidelines and
statistics.26-28 The costs of adverse events were derived
from the literature. The most significant side effect is febrile neutropenia, and a recent Canadian analysis by Lathia

The cost of salvage chemotherapy was based on a
cost analysis by Herold et al,13 who presented prerituximab data on salvage therapy and associated costs in follicular lymphoma in Canada. The cost of 6 cycles of rituximab
was added only to the first course of salvage (thus secondline therapy) because patients would likely not get rituximab with any subsequent salvage lines. The cost of palliation per 6 months was $20,767.74 for the last 6 months of
life according to a Canadian costing study.30 The cost of
death was assumed to be $0. All costs were adjusted to

RESULTS
Baseline Analysis

One-Way Sensitivity Analyses

Clinical outcomes as predicted by the model of a 30-year lifetime horizon are presented in Table 3. The life expectancy
was 7.89 years for the RM strategy, 7.82 years for the RI strategy, and 7.40 years for the WW approach. The qualityadjusted life expectancy was 6.28 QALYs for the RM strategy,
6.16 QALYs for the RI strategy, and 5.71 QALYs for the
WW strategy; this yielded an expected benefit from RM over
RI of 0.12 QALYs or 1 quality-adjusted month and from
RM over WW of 0.57 QALYs or 6.84 quality-adjusted
months through a lifetime horizon (Table 4).

One-way sensitivity analyses were performed for key variables through the ranges presented in Table 1. RI was the
least costly strategy across a broad spectrum of variable
ranges. Effectiveness in the model was robust to sensitivity
analyses, with the rituximab treatment strategies always
dominating the WW strategy. The model was sensitive to
the probability of progressing from PF1 to PD1 in the RI
arm, with the RI strategy becoming dominant if the probability was less than 0.024. With a willingness-to-pay
threshold of $50,000, RM became cost-effective if the
probability was more than 0.036. Similarly, the model
was sensitive to the probability of PD2 after BR in the RI
arm, with the RI strategy becoming dominant if the probability was less than 0.024, and RM became cost-effective
if the probability was more than 0.045. The model was
also sensitive to age, with RM being more cost-effective

Cost-Utility Analysis

The costs of the health states are presented in Table 2.
The RI strategy is $15,942 less expensive than WW with
an expected benefit of 0.45 QALYs and is $7536 cheaper
than RM, with RM being more effective by 0.12 QALYs

for patients less than 50 years of age and with RI becoming dominant for patients older than 80 years. Finally, the
model was sensitive to the time horizon, with RI always
less expensive, but it became less effective than RM with a
time horizon < 25 years.
Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses

Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (1000 simulations) were
performed with the distributions described previously.
For the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold
of $50,000, RI was the more cost-effective strategy in
55% of the simulations, RM was more cost-effective 44%
of the time, and WW was more cost-effective in only 1%
of all simulations (Fig. 3). At a higher willingness-to-pay
threshold of $80,000, RI and RM were equivalent in
being the most cost-effective strategies, and at a threshold
of $100,000, RM became cost-effective slightly more often than RI.
DISCUSSION
Because of the incurable nature of follicular lymphoma,
systemic treatment is mostly reserved for symptomatic
patients. This standard is based on several trials that have
shown no survival advantage with upfront toxic chemotherapy.3-5 With the introduction of rituximab, a potent
anti-CD20 antibody that has been shown to increase survival when it is added to standard treatments in symptomatic patients, the WW strategy has been questioned.

Rituximab monotherapy is well tolerated with few side
effects, and this makes it an attractive induction therapy
regimen. In patients with asymptomatic advanced-stage
follicular lymphoma patients, RI with or without maintenance is associated with a significant improvement in the
time to next lymphoma treatment and progression-free
survival in comparison with a WW approach. Although
this strategy has not yet been adopted as the standard of
care, epidemiologic studies suggest that physicians are
starting to use this approach.33
Cost analyses of rituximab in follicular lymphoma
have been the interest of several groups over the years.
Numerous groups have examined the cost of RM after
induction multiagent chemotherapy as well as the addition of rituximab to standard chemotherapy regimens
from European, US, and Canadian perspectives, and rituximab has generally yielded favorable economic
results.31,32 However, no analysis has yet been performed
with upfront rituximab monotherapy.
We used a Markov decision analysis model over a
lifetime horizon to compare the cost utility of RI and RM
to RI alone and a WW approach in patients with asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma, with all
patients receiving BR followed by 2 years of RM upon
progression. The model accurately predicts the disease
course, as seen by the predicted clinical outcomes and
causes of death, which are in keeping with the published
literature for large follicular lymphoma cohorts.5,34 This
model suggests that both rituximab-based strategies are
associated with similar improvements in life expectancy
and QALYs in comparison with the WW approach; however, the RI-only arm is the least expensive strategy by
more than $7000.
In the sensitivity analyses, effectiveness is sensitive to
the probability of progressing from PF1 to PD1 and to
the probability of PD2 after BR, both in the RI arm.
However, one of the rituximab-containing strategies is
always dominating the WW strategy. Even at the extreme

A rituximab-containing monotherapy induction strategy for low-burden, asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma is the dominant strategy in comparison with a watch and wait approach: it maximizes both life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy and is cost-saving.

end values for these variables that remain reasonable on
the basis of the literature, the largest difference is 0.2
QALYs (or 2.4 months) in favor of RM over RI over a 30year time horizon. Thus, although RM is slightly more
effective than RI, the difference in either direction is minimal, and this demonstrates that the quality-adjusted life
expectancy is essentially the same with both RI followed
by RM and RI alone, but they both dominate the WW
strategy.
Therefore, this model is effectively a costminimization analysis because of the relatively neutral
effectiveness difference between the 2 rituximab strategies;
however, they maximize quality-adjusted life expectancy
over the WW approach by 5 to 6 months. The cost analysis demonstrating that RI is cheaper than both RM and
WW was robust to any sensitivity analyses of all key variables, and this was confirmed with probabilistic sensitivity
analyses, according to which a rituximab-containing
induction strategy is cost-effective 99% of the time, with
RI alone without maintenance being cost-effective 55%
of the time. This is boosted by the ICER of RM versus RI
being $62,360/QALY, which is higher than the commonly accepted cost-effective ICER of $50,000/QALY.
RI for patients with low-burden, asymptomatic advancedstage follicular lymphoma is cost-effective over a lifetime
horizon and minimizes costs by about $15,000 per patient
with an improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy.
The cost savings are likely driven by a decreased need for
more costly salvage chemotherapies in patients receiving
RI. Moreover, some of these patients die from other agerelated conditions, and the expensive costs of cancerrelated palliation are potentially avoided.
There are several limitations to this model. Salvage
therapy did not include autologous stem cell transplantation or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Currently, autologous stem cell transplantation is not the standard of
care in Canada and other jurisdictions for relapsed follicular lymphoma. A minority of patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant
(<10%), and in this low-burden population, the percentage would likely be much smaller, without a large impact
on results.31,35 Moreover, including transplantation
would preferentially increase the expenditures associated
with the WW strategy because more people using this
strategy would require salvage. Second, we do not know
whether receiving rituximab monotherapy upfront affects
the likelihood of future responses to rituximab retreatment as part of multiagent chemotherapy. We addressed
this by modeling a lower response rate to BR and benefits
with RM. However, even under the assumption that there
2644

is no benefit from RM after BR, RI is still cheaper with a
minimal difference in effectiveness. Finally, the costs for
salvage therapy were derived from the literature. In this
era of new biologic agents, the options for salvage therapy
are quickly changing, with differing practices across different centers. However, the model was robust to sensitivity
analyses of a wide range of costs for salvage therapy.
In conclusion, a rituximab-containing monotherapy
induction strategy for asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma is the dominant strategy over a WW
approach and maximizes both life expectancy and qualityadjusted life expectancy while being cost-saving. RI
monotherapy, consisting of 4 weekly doses, is the most
cost-effective strategy overall, with neutral effectiveness in
comparison with RI followed by maintenance, but it leads
to significant cost minimization over a lifetime horizon.
