ABSTRACT:
One-hundred-fifty-three
biliary
cancers,
including
70
intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinomas (ICC), 57 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ECC) and 26
gallbladder carcinomas (GBC) were assessed for mutations in 56 genes using
multigene next-generation sequencing. Expression of EGFR and mTOR pathway genes
was investigated by immunohistochemistry. At least one mutated gene was observed
in 118/153 (77%) cancers. The genes most frequently involved were KRAS (28%),
TP53 (18%), ARID1A (12%), IDH1/2 (9%), PBRM1 (9%), BAP1 (7%), and PIK3CA
(7%). IDH1/2 (p=0.0005) and BAP1 (p=0.0097) mutations were characteristic of
ICC, while KRAS (p=0.0019) and TP53 (p=0.0019) were more frequent in ECC and
GBC. Multivariate analysis identified tumour stage and TP53 mutations as independent
predictors of survival. Alterations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A, BAP1,
PBRM1, SMARCB1) were seen in 31% of cases. Potentially actionable mutations were
seen in 104/153 (68%) cancers: i) KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations were found in 34%
of cancers; ii) mTOR pathway activation was documented by immunohistochemistry
in 51% of cases and by mutations in mTOR pathway genes in 19% of cancers; iii)
TGF-ß/Smad signaling was altered in 10.5% cancers; iv) mutations in tyrosine kinase
receptors were found in 9% cases. Our study identified molecular subgroups of
cholangiocarcinomas that can be explored for specific drug targeting in clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

(WHO) as intrahepatic (ICC) or extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinomas (ECC) [1, 2]. The former arise in
the substance of the liver, the latter in large extrahepatic
ducts, i.e. hepatic ducts and common bile duct.
Gallbladder carcinomas (GBC) also have biliary epithelial

differentiation. Clinically, both cholangiocarcinomas and
GBC have very poor prognosis. Surgical resection is
the only potentially curative therapy, but most cases are
inoperable [3-7]. In contrast to other solid tumours, no
effective molecular targeted agent has been approved for
biliary tract cancers, and patients have limited access to
clinical trials [8-11].
Previous studies on molecular alterations in biliary
tract cancers have focused on selected genes, including
those altered in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (KRAS, TP53,
CDKN2A and SMAD4) [12]. Mutations in PIK3CA,
PTEN, AKT1, IDH1 and IDH2 have been reported in this
class of tumours [13-20]. However, the prevalence of these
alterations varies widely among studies. Two recent whole
exome-sequencing studies of ICC revealed a key role for
chromatin remodeling genes BAP1, ARID1A and PBRM1
in the development of these tumours [13, 21].
The validation of whole exome studies by
sequencing analysis of hotspot mutations in larger and
characterized series has been a fruitful approach in
identifying potential targets for personalized therapy for
several malignancies [22]. Next-generation sequencing
(NGS) has been recently introduced and is the most
sensitive approach to simultaneously characterize multiple
genes starting from a limited amount of DNA, also DNA
derived from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
samples [13, 23-25].
In the present study, we assayed the mutational status
of 56 cancer-related genes in 153 biliary tract cancers,
using a targeted next-generation sequencing methodology,
with the aim of identifying molecular subgroups driving
the development of personalized therapy approaches for
patients affected by these neoplasms.

(HBV and/or HCV) and cirrhosis prevalence were
significantly higher in ICC patients (p=0.041 and p=0.005,
respectively).
The pathologic stage of the 153 neoplasms was
Stage I in 20, II in 51, III in 43, and IV in 39. ICC
presented with more advanced stages at surgery compared
to ECC and GBC (Table 1; p=0.034).

Next-generation sequencing of 56 genes dissects
cholangiocarcinoma molecular heterogeneity
DNA from all samples was successfully amplified
in multiplex PCR for the 56 genes and an adequate library
for deep sequencing was obtained. The mean read length
was 78 base pairs and a mean coverage of 1800x was
achieved, with 87.1% target bases covered more than
100x. A minimum coverage of 20x was obtained in all
cases.
At least one mutation was observed in 118/153
(77.1%) samples (Table 2, Figure 1); 60 cases (39.2%)
showed concurrent mutations in different genes; 35
(22.9%) tumours showed no alterations in the 56 genes
assayed. The most commonly mutated genes in the whole
series were KRAS (28.1%), TP53 (18.3%), ARID1A
(11.8%), IDH1/IDH2 (9.2%), PBRM1 (9.2%), BAP1
(7.2%), and PIK3CA (7.2%). Mutations in BRAF, KRAS,
and TP53 were all confirmed at Sanger sequencing (Figure
2).
Mutations were differently distributed across the
different tumour subtypes: IDH1/IDH2 (p=0.0005) were
restricted to ICC and BAP1 mutations were all found in
ICC (p=0.0097) with the exception of one GBC, while
KRAS (p=0.0019) and TP53 (p=0.0019) were more
represented in ECC and GBC, respectively (Table 2).
ICC were characterized by a high prevalence
of IDH1/IDH2 mutations (20.0%) and the significant
involvement of chromatin remodeling genes PBRM1
(14.3%), BAP1 (14.3%) and ARID1A (11.4%) (Figure
3), as described[32, 33]. BAP1 and IDH1 were mutually
exclusive, whereas mutations in IDH2 were always
associated to BAP1 mutations (3/3 cases). Eleven (15.7%)
ICC had mutations in at least one of mTOR pathway
genes: AKT1 (2.8%), PIK3CA (5.7%), PIK3C2A (7.1%),
PIK3C2G (4.3%), and PTEN (1.4%). Mutations in tyrosine
kinase receptors were uncommon, with the exception of
TGFRB2 (4.3%). Of interest, most NRAS (5 of 6) and all
BRAF (3 of 3) mutations clustered in ICC tumour subtype
and were mutually exclusive with KRAS (15.7%). TP53
was mutated in 6 cases (8.6%). Low prevalence mutations
were found in APC, CDKN2A, ERBB4, FBXW7, FGFR3,
KDR/VEGFR2, SMAD4, and STK11.
In ECC, KRAS was the most commonly mutated
gene (47.4%), with codons 12, 13, 61 and 146 affected;
one mutation was observed in NRAS, and none in BRAF.
TP53 was the second most mutated gene (17.5%).

RESULTS
Clinico-pathological characteristics of the series
Patients’ demographic and clinico-pathological data
are summarized in Table 1. Mean tumour size was 4.8±3.4
cm (median=6.5; range=0.5-20.0), and was significantly
higher in ICC than ECC and GBC (p=9.77 E-12).
Synchronous multinodular lesions were found in 31 cases
(20.3%). Tumour grading was G1 in 20, G2 in 94, and G3
in 38 cases, while the remaining case was undifferentiated.
Biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN) was
present in 49/153 cases (32.0%), and its prevalence was
significantly higher in ECC and GBC compared to ICC
(ICC=15.7%; ECC=42.1%; GBC=53.8%; p=0.0002).
Vascular and perineural invasion were present in 107
(69.9%) and 93 (60.8%) cases, respectively. Perineural
invasion showed a significantly lower prevalence in
ICC than ECC and GBC (ICC=44.3%; ECC=77.2%;
GBC=69.2%; p=0.0005). Hepatitis virus infection

mTOR pathway is dysregulated in all
cholangiocarcinoma subtypes and Egfr is
significantly overexpressed in intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinomas

Excluding ARID1A (12.3%), chromatin-remodeling genes
were occasionally involved (PBRM1: 3.5%), whereas
24.6% of ECCs showed mTOR pathway gene mutations,
including PIK3CA (8.7%), PIK3C2A (7.0%), PIK3C2G
(8.7%), and PTEN (3.5%). SMAD4 mutations were
observed in 6 cases (10.5%) and were mutually exclusive
to TGFBR2 mutations that were found in 3 cases (5.3%).
Low prevalence mutations were found in CTNNB1,
FBXW7, and KDR/VEGFR2. The EGFR T790M mutation
was observed in one case [34].
GBC showed a high prevalence of TP53 mutations
(12/26, 46.2%), and in 6 cases TP53 mutation was the only
alteration detected. KRAS was mutated in 19.2% of cases.
Chromatin remodeling genes were mutated in 30.8%
of cases: ARID1A, 11.5%; BAP1, 3.8%; PBRM1, 7.7%;
SMARCB1, 7.7%. MTOR pathway genes were mutated in
11.5% of cases: PIK3CA (7.7%) and PTEN (3.8%).

The results of immunohistochemistry are
summarized in Table 3. We investigated mTOR pathway
and Egfr expression in 113 neoplastic and 18 control
cases. EGFR gene copy number was analyzed by FISH.
A significant over-expression of the activated
forms of mTOR and its effectors p70S6K and 4EBP1
was seen in most cancers with no significant differences
among subtypes, but for p70S6K (Table 3). Of interest,
the expression of phosphorylated ph-mTOR was
significantly associated to the expression of the activated
downstream effectors ph-4EBP1 and ph-p70S6K (p=0.05
and p=0.00012, respectively). Pten was significantly

of cancer outcome were tumour stage (p=0.0001), TP53
(p=0.0043) and KRAS (p=0.0162) mutations (Figure 5).
Considering together KRAS/BRAF alterations, tumors
characterized by mutations in KRAS/BRAF genes were
associated to a worse patients’ prognosis (p=0.0054).
ICC showed a better outcome than ECC (p=0.018). No
correlation emerged for any of the other clinicopathologic
variables considered: sex, age, grade, vascular/perineural
invasion.
Cox multivariate analysis including tumour subtype,
stage, grade, vascular and perineural invasion, IDH1/2
mutations, KRAS and TP53 mutations, identified only
Stage III (p=0.005; OR 4.27; 95%C.I. 1.54-11.8), Stage
IV (p=0.003; OR 4.85; 95%C.I. 1.68-14.0), and TP53

down-regulated in the whole series, particularly in ECC
of common bile duct and in GBC: a weak cytoplasmic/
nuclear immunolabeling was observed in most cases.
Egfr expression was significantly altered in biliary
tract tumours, with different subtype specific profiles.
Forty cancers (35.4%) labeled for Egfr with sharp
membranous pattern and signals ranging from very strong
to moderate (Table 3, Figure 1 and Figure 4). Strong (3+)
overexpression was observed only in the ICC subtype.
At FISH analysis, 3/113 (2.7%) tumours showed EGFR
amplification (Figure 1).
There was no significant association between
both EGFR and mTOR pathway immunophenotype and
mutational status.

TP53 mutation is an independent prognostic
factor in cholangiocarcinoma

DISCUSSION

Survival data were available in 125 cases (ICC=51;
ECC=50; GBC=24). Median survival was 31 months and
79 (63.2%) subjects were followed to their deaths from
disease.
At univariate analysis, the most significant predictors
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The results of our next-generation mutational survey
of 56 cancer genes in 153 biliary tree carcinomas can be
summarized as follows: i) the vast majority (77.1%) of
2846

Oncotarget

cancers harbours a driver-gene mutation; ii) the diverse
sites of origin in the biliary tree have significantly different
molecular profiles, and each site of origin also shows
molecular heterogeneity; iii) targetable pathway alterations
are present in 68% (104/153) of cancers, defining
molecular cancer subclasses; iv) specific alterations are
eligible for the investigational development of prognostic
and non-invasive follow-up markers.
The vast majority of cancers (118/153, 77.1%)
harboured at least one driver-gene mutation, and 39.2%
(60/153 cases) showed concurrent mutations in two
or more genes. KRAS was the most frequently mutated
gene (28.1%), followed by TP53 (18.3%), as reported
in prior studies [9, 14, 35-38]. The recently described
frequent involvement of the chromatin remodeling genes
ARID1A, PBRM1 and BAP1 [9, 13] was also confirmed
in our series, being found in 11.8%, 9.2% and 7.2% of
cases, respectively. Univariate survival analysis showed
that KRAS mutations were associated to a worse patients’
prognosis confirming the univariate analysis previously
described by Andersen [42]. Multivariate survival analysis
identified tumour stage and TP53 gene mutations as
independent predictors of poor survival.
The different sites of origin showed significantly
diverse molecular characteristics. IDH1/IDH2 mutations
were restricted to ICC (p=0.0005) and, with the exception
of one GBC, BAP1 mutations were all found in ICC

(p=0.0097). ECC and GBC were characterized by a high
prevalence of KRAS (p=0.0019) and TP53 (p=0.0019)
mutations, respectively.
The standard of care of biliary tract cancer is based
on the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine [39]. To
date, clinical trials with targeted therapies for advanced
biliary tract cancers have failed to produce significant
benefits [11], and ongoing studies are exploring the
combination of chemotherapy with novel MAPK/ERK
Kinase (MEK) and mTOR inhibitors [40]. However,
neither previous nor ongoing studies have considered
evaluating tumour response against genetic alterations.
Our identification of molecular subclasses with specific
drug actionable pathway alterations in 104/153 (68.0%)
tumours may tailor the design of trials based on the
molecular selection of patients, irrespective of the site
of origin, where actionable signaling pathways include
tyrosine-kinase receptors (TKR), RAS/RAF/MAPK/ERK,
mTOR, and TGF-ß.
Mutations in tyrosine kinase receptors (ALK, EGFR,
ERBB2, ERBB4, FGFR3, MET, KIT, KDR/VEGFR2)
potentially amenable to target therapies were found in
9.2% of cases, with a higher prevalence in GBC (6/26
cases, 23.1%) than in ICC (4/70 cases, 5.7%) and ECC
(4/57, 7.0%). In spite of a relatively high prevalence of
Egfr overexpression detected by immunohistochemistry
(35.4% of cases with 2+ or 3+), only two cases had

EGFR mutations and three had gene amplification,
confirming the low prevalence reported in the literature
in cholangiocarcinomas unassociated with chronic liver
disease [14, 38, 41-44].
Mutations in components of the RAS pathway
(KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) were observed in 34% of the whole
series. In particular KRAS was the most frequently mutated
gene in the 153 tumours (28.1%). KRAS mutations have
been described in most of prior studies [9, 14, 35-38].
KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive,
and the highest mutation prevalence in RAS pathway
was observed in ECC (49.1%) vs. ICC (27.1%) and GBC
(19.2%). Of note, RAS mutations sensitize tumours to
MEK inhibitors, highlighting the importance of these
mutations in the use of targeted therapies [11, 40].
MTOR pathway relevance in biliary tract cancers
is suggested by our immunohistochemical detection of
activated forms of mTor and its downstream effectors
in 51.3% of the cancers. The molecular basis of this
activation in a proportion of cases is the mutation in one
of the genes involved in this pathway (i.e., AKT, FBXW7,
PIK3CA, PIK3C2A, PIK3C2G, PTEN). This suggests
that mTOR inhibitors might play a role in this molecular
subgroup of patients.
TGF-ß/Smad signaling was altered in 16/153 cases
(10.5%), 9 of which were ECC (9/57, 15.8%). Our finding
supports previous studies demonstrating the involvement
of this pathway in cholangiocarcinomas[45, 46]. Our
study may have underestimated the involvement of this
pathway, as only the mutational status of TGFBR2 and
SMAD4 genes was investigated, and the latter is frequently
inactivated by mechanisms different from intragenic
mutations, such as homozygous deletions, which would
not be detected by the techniques used in this study.
Alterations in chromatin remodeling genes
(ARID1A, BAP1, IDH1, IDH2, PBRM1, SMARCB1)
were found in 30.7% (47/153) of cancers in our series,
confirming recent reports on the significant involvement
of these genes in cholangiocarcinoma [9, 13]. Mutations
in these genes appear to be either specific to ICC, as is
the case of IDH1 and IDH2 (p=0.0005), or cluster within
this cancer type as is the case for ARID1A, BAP1, and
PBRM1 that were found in 34.3% (24/70) of ICC. The
open challenge is now to translate knowledge of the
targeting of these genes to improved patient care through
either the development of new disease specific markers or
of therapy targets. Of interest, IDH1/2 mutated cancers
accumulate 2-hydroxyglutarate in tumour tissue and
release the molecule in blood, and the measurement of
2-hydroxyglutarate might be used as both a surrogate
biomarker for IDH1/2 mutational status and a noninvasive test for the assessment of tumour burden in ICC
[47].
Our study is limited by the number of genes
analyzed; 35 cancers (22.9%) showed no alterations in the
56 genes assayed, including 50 genes from a commercial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

panel and a custom panel exploring 6 recently discovered
cholangiocarcinoma genes [9, 13]. Mechanisms different
from intragenic mutations, such as amplifications,
deletions, translocations, and epigenetic anomalies should
also be addressed.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that specific
molecular alterations are associated to different
cholangiocarcinomas categories and that potentially drug
actionable pathways are evident in 68% of cases. These
data further support the pathological and molecular
heterogeneity characterizing biliary tree carcinomas. In
currently designed clinical trials, cholangiocarcinomas
are grouped together irrespective of their intrahepatic
or extrahepatic site of origin. Our study shows that ICC
and ECC should be considered separately, since they
have different molecular characteristics. However, in the
advent of molecular designed clinical trials, it would be
appropriate to consider them together but only for the
proportion of ICC and ECC sharing common molecular
alterations.
We also show that a high-throughput next-generation
sequencing analysis can be successfully applied using low
amounts of DNA from routinely processed paraffin tissues.
Such a time- and cost-effective analysis is the basis to
significantly improve the development of personalized
treatments for cholangiocarcinoma patients, and their early
access to innovative drugs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cases
A retrospective series (1990-2011) of 153 surgicallyresected primary biliary cancers were retrieved from
the FFPE archives of the ARC-Net Biobank at Verona
University Hospital under the local ethics committee
approval (n. prog. 1959). All cases were re-classified
according to WHO 2010 [1], and included 70 ICC, 57
ECC and 26 GBC. Staging was according to AJCC/
UICC 7th edition[26]. Matched normal liver was used to
determine the somatic/germline nature of mutations.
In 113 cases (57 ICC, 40 ECC, 16 GBC), sufficient
material for the construction of 1-mm cores tissue
microarrays (TMAs) was available. Eighteen nonneoplastic controls (8 normal biliary duct and 10 chronic
cholecystitis) were included in the TMAs. Three tissue
cores per case were analyzed.

DNA extraction and qualification
DNA was prepared after enrichment for neoplastic
cellularity to at least 70% using manual microdissection
of 10 consecutive 4-µm FFPE sections, purified using the
QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen), and qualified as
2848

reported elsewhere [24, 27].

consecutive 4-µm FFPE TMA sections. Appropriate
positive and negative controls were run concurrently.
Egfr expression was scored according to the EGFR
pharmDx protocol (Dako): 0, no staining or membrane
staining in ≤10% cancer cells; 1+, faint and partial
membrane staining in >10% cancer cells; 2+, moderate
and complete membrane staining in >10% cancer cells;
3+, strong and complete membrane staining in >10%
cancer cells. Cases were then classified in two groups
Egfr-positive (2+ and 3+) or Egfr-negative (0 and 1+).
Pten expression was considered positive if more
than 50% of neoplastic cells showed a moderate/strong
nuclear and cytoplasmic immunoreaction[29].
Staining for phosphorylated markers (ph-mTOR,
ph-4EBP1, and ph-p70S6K) was considered positive when
tumour cells showed cytoplasmic and/or nuclear staining
with equal to stronger intensity compared with that of
endothelial cells [30].

Next-Generation Sequencing of Multiplex PCR
Amplicons
Two multigene panels were used: the 50-gene Ion
AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot panel v2 (Life Technologies)
and an AmpliSeq custom panel targeting 6 genes not
included in the commercial panel. The first explores
selected regions of 50 cancer- genes: ABL1, AKT1, ALK,
APC, ATM, BRAF, CDH1, CDKN2A, CSF1R, CTNNB1,
EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, EZH2, FBXW7, FGFR1,
FGFR2, FGFR3, FLT3, GNA11, GNAS, GNAQ, HNF1A,
HRAS, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, JAK3, KDR/VEGFR2,
KIT, KRAS, MET, MLH1, MPL, NOTCH1, NPM1,
NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, PTPN11, RB1, RET,
SMAD4, SMARCB1, SMO, SRC, STK11, TP53, VHL.
Details on target regions of the commercial panel are
at http://www.lifetechnologies.com. The custom panel
targets 6 genes selected upon the results of published ICC
exome sequencing: ARID1A, BAP1, PBRM1, PIK3C2A,
PIK3C2G, TGFBR2[13]. Details of the custom panel are
in Supplementary Table 1.
Twenty nanograms of DNA were used for
each multiplex PCR amplification. Emulsion PCR
was performed with the OneTouch2 system (Life
Technologies). The quality of the obtained libraries
was evaluated by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer on-chip
electrophoresis (Agilent Technologies). Sequencing was
run on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM,
Life Technologies) loaded with 316 (50-gene panel) or 318
chips (6-gene panel). Data analysis, including alignment
to the hg19 human reference genome and variant calling,
was done using the Torrent Suite Software v.3.6 (Life
Technologies). Filtered variants were annotated using the
SnpEff software v.3.1. Alignments were visually verified
with the Integrative Genomics Viewer; IGV v.2.2, Broad
Institute.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
The EGFR gene copy number status was assessed
applying the Vysis EGFR/CEP7 Probe Kit (Vysis/Abbott
Molecular). At least 50 representative nuclei per specimen
were scored and EGFR-amplification was defined as
described [31].

Statistical analysis
Kruskal-Wallis test, Chi-squared test with Monte
Carlo simulation, and Fisher’s exact test corrected for
multiple comparisons were used as appropriate. For
comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Mantel-Cox
log-rank test was used; for multivariate survival analysis,
stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression was used;
selection of the best model was performed using the
“backward elimination” algorithm. For all the analyses
a p-value below 0.05 was considered significant. Graphs
and univariate analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism® version 5.00 for Mac (GraphPad Software, San
Diego California USA), multivariate Cox regression was
done with R v. 3.0.2, using survival library v.2.37-4.

DNA Sanger Sequencing
To validate the mutations detected by deep
sequencing, BRAF (exon 11), KRAS (exon 2), and TP53
(exons 2, 5, 6, 7, 8) were analyzed by Sanger sequencing
[28].
