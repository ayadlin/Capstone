Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) amplicon is frequently amplified in numerous human
cancers including gliomas. PIKE-A, a proto-oncogene that is one of the important components of
the CDK4 amplicon, binds to and enhances the kinase activity of Akt, thereby promoting cancer
progression. To define the roles of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction in glioblastoma multiform (GBM)
progression, we used biochemical protein/protein interaction (PPI) assays and live cell
fluorescence-based protein complementation assays to search for small peptide antagonist from
these proteins that were able to block their interaction. Here, we show that disruption of the
interaction between PIKE-A and Akt by the small peptides significantly reduces glioblastoma cell
proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion. Disruption of PIKE-A/Akt association
potently suppressed GBM cell proliferation and sensitized the cells to two clinical drugs that are
currently used to treat GBM. Interestingly, GBM cells containing the CDK4 amplicon were more
responsive to the inhibition of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction than GBM cells lacking this amplicon.
Taken together, our findings provide proof-of-principle that blocking a PPI that is essential for
cancer progression provides a valuable strategy for therapeutic discovery.

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiform (GBM), the most common type of primary brain tumors, are highly
aggressive, infiltrative and destructive. Recently, radiotherapy plus concomitant and
adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) was shown to significantly improve the survival of GBM
patients without reducing their quality of life.1,2 However, the aggressive nature of
glioblastomas renders current treatments, the median survival after treatment is 14 months.
Therefore, novel and effective therapeutic interventions for GBM are urgently needed. For
this reason, tremendous effort has been spent to identify tumorigenic or tumor-promoting

genomic events and molecular pathways that directly drive malignant transformation and
tumor progression.

GBM comprehensive genomic profiles mapped by The Cancer Genome Atlas project reveal
that one of the most common copy-number alterations in GBM is amplification at
chromosome 12q13.3-14.1. This amplification is also observed in many other human
cancers including melanoma, breast cancers and lung cancers.3 – 7 Importantly, glioblastoma
patients harboring this amplification had markedly decreased survival. The cyclin-dependent
kinase 4 (CDK4) gene has been postulated as the target of this amplification. CDK4
promotes proliferation by inhibiting the Rb1 tumor suppressor and by sequestering p27Kip1
and p21Cip1, thereby promoting E2F- and Cdk2-dependent cell cycle progression.8
However, CDK4 overexpression alone does not induce spontaneous tumorigenesis in
transgenic animal models, suggesting that CDK4 cooperates with other genetic changes to
initiate tumorigenesis.9 Frequently co-amplified with CDK4 is CENTG1. CENTG1 encodes
a GTPase called PIKE, which directly binds and activates PI 3-kinase and Akt.10 – 13 PIKEA, a member of the PIKE family, is present in various tissues with higher expression levels
in the brain, spleen, thymus, small intestine and peripheral blood leukocytes.14 – 16 PIKE-A
contains the GTPase, PH, ArfGAP and two Ankyrin repeat domains present in PIKE-L, but
lacks the N-terminal proline-rich domain, which binds protein 4.1N, PI 3-kinase and PLC1.10,11 PIKE-A directly binds to Akt and upregulates its activity in a GTP-dependent
manner, mediating cancer cell invasion.12,13 Human cancer cells with PIKE-amplification
are more resistant to apoptosis compared with cancer cells with a normal PIKE-A copy
number. Over-expression of wild-type PIKE-A has been shown to stimulate Akt activity and
inhibit apoptosis, whereas it has been demonstrated that knockdown of PIKE-A diminishes
Akt activity and enhances apoptosis. Therefore, PIKE-A amplification promotes cancer cell
growth by inhibiting apoptosis through stimulation of Akt.12,13 Moreover, PIKE-A acts as a
proto-oncogene, promoting cancer cell survival, invasion and transformation through Akt
activation.17 Most recently, an automated network-based approach, which is used for
determining candidate oncogenic processes and driver genes, identified new candidate
cancer-causing drivers in GBM, including AGAP2/CENTG1, a putative oncogene and an
activator of the PI 3-kinase pathway.18 This approach is based on the hypothesis that cellular
networks contain functional modules and that tumors target-specific modules critical to their
growth. Thus, CDK4 and CENTG1 might comprise a functionally integrated oncogene
DNA cluster that promotes aggressiveness in human cancers by cooperatively targeting the
Rb1 and PI3K/AKT pathways.19 In this report, we demonstrate that disruption of PIKE-A/
Akt protein/protein interaction (PPI) leads to reduction of GBM cell proliferation, survival,
migration and invasion. Moreover, peptides that inhibit this protein complex also sensitize
GBM cells to two clinical anti-cancer medicines TMZ and Carmustine (BCNU), especially
in GBM cells that harbor the CDK4 amplicon. Therefore, our study provides a proof-ofconcept that blockade of critical PPIs in GMB can be a therapeutic target for treating these
devastating cancers.

RESULTS
PIKE-A interacts with Akt in live cells
We have previously demonstrated that PIKE-A interacts with Akt in human cancer cells,
and determined that the N-terminus of PIKE-A and C-terminus of Akt regulate the
interaction between these two proteins.12,13 A schematic representation of the protein
domains of PIKE-A and Akt and their binding motifs are shown in Figure 1a. Upon further
mapping analysis, we found that the purified GST-tagged recombinant N-terminal fragment
(a.a. 72–128) of PIKE-A interacted with HA-Akt (Figure 1b), which was independent with
GTP/GDP.12 To visualize the interaction between these two proteins, we utilized a Venusbased protein complementation assay. In this assay, the N-terminus of the Venus protein is

fused to one protein of interest, while the C-terminus of Venus is fused to another protein. If
the two proteins bind to each other, the N-Venus and C-Venus proteins will come in close
proximity allowing the Venus protein to reconstitute and yield a fluorescent signal after
excitation. As 14-3-3 often exists as dimmers, we used a 14-3-3 protein pair as a positive
control. As expected, co-transfection of N-Venus-14-3-3 and C-Venus-14-3-3 resulted in a
strong Venus signal, thereby validating this assay. To investigate whether the PIKE-A/Akt
interaction occurred in cells, we sub cloned PIKE-A and Akt into pDEST26-C-Venus and
pSCM167-N-Venus20 vectors, respectively, and co-transfected these vectors into the LN229
GBM cell line. Similar to the 14-3-3 pair, co-expression of PIKE-A and Akt resulted in a
robust Venus signal. In contrast, co-transfection of C-Venus-PIKE-A and the empty NVenus vector or C-Venus-Akt and the empty C-Venus vector did not yield significant Venus
signals (Figure 1c). Quantitative analysis of the resulting Venus signals is summarized in
Figure 1d. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PIKE-A and Akt interact with each
other in live LN229 cells.
Synthetic peptides (sp) derived from the binding motifs of PIKE-A and Akt block their
interaction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although the whole protein X-ray structure of PIKE-A is not available yet, the threedimensional structures of its GTPase domain and PH domain have been elucidated.21,22
Molecular modeling of the N-terminus of PIKE-A (a.a. 1–128) predicts the protein folding
to include several -strands, a -helix and a loop (Figure 2a). Based on the predicted
structure, we synthesized three peptides with 19 to 27 amino-acid residues (PP1 to PP3). To
investigate whether these peptides could disrupt the interaction between PIKE-A and Akt,
we conducted an in vitro binding assay using purified recombinant GST-PIKE-A protein
and HA-Akt, which was isolated from transfected HEK293 cells. Introduction of PP1 or PP2
peptides into the binding solution completely disrupted the association between PIKE-A and
Akt at both 10 and 50 M concentrations (Figure 2b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The three-dimensional structure of Akt has been previously reported before.23 As we have
previously demonstrated that the C-terminus of Akt is required for its interaction with PIKEA, we designed several small peptides (AP1-AP3) based on the C-terminal regulatory
domain structure, which contains -helices and a loop structure (Figure 2c). Two of the
small peptides, AP1 and AP3, robustly abolished the binding between PIKE-A and Akt,
whereas AP2 enhanced the association between these two proteins in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2d). To measure the affinity of interaction between PIKE-A and Akt, we
examined the effect of various peptides on the interaction of the purified full-length PIKE-A
and Akt in an in vitro binding assay. We found that PP1, PP2, AP1 and AP2 suppressed the
interaction between PIKE-A and Akt in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 of
0.41, 1.22, 0.87 and 14.06 M (Figure 2e). Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of
candidate peptides by co-transfecting GST-PIKE-A and HA-Akt into HEK293 cells,
followed by a GST pull-down assay performed in the presence of various antagonist
peptides. Notably, incubation with PP1 resulted in the dose-dependent disruption of the
PIKE-A/Akt interaction, which was also observed to a lesser degree upon incubation with
AP1 and AP3. Interestingly, PP2 did not demonstrate an inhibitory effect, even at the 10 M
concentration (Figure 2f). The discrepant efficacy of ability of the small peptides to inhibit
the interaction between PIKE-A and Akt might result from the different folding
conformations between full-length PIKE-A and the shorter form of PIKE-A (a.a. 1–356).
PP1 and AP1 disrupt the PIKE-A/Akt interaction in live cells
To examine dissociating PIKE-A from Akt by the peptides in intact cells, we co-transfected
N-Venus-PIKE-A and C-Venus-Akt into LN229 cells along with various GST-tagged
antagonist peptides. As shown in Figure 3a, expression of GST-PP1 almost completely

blocked the binding between PIKE-A and Akt, whereas GST-PP2 and GST-AP1 partially
reduced the association (Figure 3a). Quantitative analysis of the signals indicated that GSTPP1 and GST-AP1 significantly decreased the interaction between PIKE-A and Akt (Figure
3b). The expression of the transfected peptides, PIKE-A, and Akt were similar between all
samples (Figure 3c).
PP1 and AP1 suppress GBM cell survival, viability, migration and invasion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate the biological effects of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction in GMB cells with
different genetic backgrounds, we utilized the LN229 and LN-Z308 cell lines. Although
LN229 cells do not contain the CDK4 amplicon, LN-Z308 cells possess theCDK4
amplicon.13 After confirming the transfection efficiency (Supplementary Figure 1), we
carried out tumorigenesis assays to evaluate the effect of peptides on GMB cell viability,
migration and invasion. Transfection of GST-PP1 substantially reduced the survival of LNZ308, whereas it had no effect on LN229 cells. Conversely, GST-AP1 significantly
decreased the survival of LN229 cells, while it had negligible effect on LN-Z308 cells. The
transfection efficiency was confirmed using co-transfected GFP (Supplementary Figure 1).
As expected, GST and GST-PP2 did not have any effect on cell survival, regardless of the
cell line (Figure 4a). Therefore, disrupting the interaction between PIKE-A and Akt strongly
induces CDK4 amplicon-containing LN-Z308 cell death. Similar results were obtained from
colony formation assays. GST-PP1 and GST-AP1 potently inhibited colony formation in
LZ-Z308 cells, while GST-AP1 significantly inhibited colony formation in LN229 cells
(Figure 4b). TMZ and BCNU are two anti-cancer drugs that are used in the clinic for
treatment of GBM. To test whether disrupting the PIKE-A/Akt interaction will further
enhance the anti-cancer effects of these two drugs, we transfected LN229 and LN-Z308 cells
with the short antagonist peptides and incubated the cells in the presence of 25 M of TMZ
or 50- M BCNU. In LN229 cells, BCNU treatment reduced cell viability regardless of
peptide transfection. However, in TMZ-treated cells, the PP1 peptide markedly reduced cell
viability compared with the GST control and PP2 peptide. Although, TMZ treatment
resulted in a modest effect in repressing LN229 cell viability compared with vehicle (Figure
4c). In LN-Z308 cells, transfection of PP1 or AP1 alone was sufficient to diminish cell
viability. Interestingly, treatment with BCNU or TMZ did not prominently enhance effect of
these peptides on cell viability (Figure 4d).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To examine the effect of disruption of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction on GBM on cell
migration, we transfected the antagonist peptides into LN229 and LN-Z308 cells followed
by cell migration analysis. The results demonstrated that none of these peptides significantly
reduced the migration of LN229 cells. In contrast, both PP1 and AP1, but not PP2, potently
reduced the migration of LN-Z308 cells as compared with control GST (Figure 4e).
Moreover, we also investigated the effect of the peptides on GBM cell invasion. To this end,
we co-transfected GST-tagged peptides with GFP into the GBM cells and quantitatively
analyzed the invasion of GFP-positive cells. Both PP1 and AP1, but not PP2, robustly
repressed the invasion of both LN229 and LN-Z308 cells as compared with control GST
(Figure 4f). Collectively, these data suggest that inhibition of the PIKE-A/Akt PPI by the
PP1 and AP1 peptides might suppress GBM cancer progression. Furthermore, we found that
these peptides can also enhance the anti-cancer activities of TMZ and BCNU in CDK4
amplicon-containing GBM cells.
Design of smaller synthetic peptides disrupting the PIKE-A/Akt interaction
The PP1, PP2 and AP1 peptides contain 19, 19 and 21 amino-acid residues, respectively.
Owing to their relatively large size, they cannot penetrate the cell plasma membrane and
enter live cells by diffusion. In order to develop smaller peptides that are able to enter live
cells and disrupt the PIKE-A/Akt interaction, we synthesized three shorter peptides for each

of the above peptides. The sequence of each of the short peptides is listed in Figure 5a. The
results from an in vitro binding assay revealed that the sp2 peptide (PELRLGVL) from PP1,
sp4 peptide (DARSG) and sp6 peptide (TGSYQ) from PP2, and sp9 peptide (LKKDPK)
from AP1 decreased the interaction between a fragment of PIKE-A (1–356 a.a.) and Akt
(Figures 5a and b). Quantitative analysis of several independent assays indicated that at 50
M sp2, sp4 and sp6 significantly disrupt the interaction between PIKE-A and Akt. Notably,
at 10 M, PP2 and smaller peptides derived from PP2, sp4 and sp6, failed to block the
PIKE-A/Akt interaction, but at 50 M, sp4 and sp6 peptides were able to disrupt the
interaction between PIKE-A and Akt (Figure 5c). To further investigate the inhibitory
effects of the shorter peptides, we co-transfected GST-PIKE-A full-length and HA-Akt and
performed GST pull-down assay. The results from these assays indicate that sp2, sp4 and
sp6 exhibit a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of PIKE-A to Akt; in contrast, none of
the short peptides from the Akt C-terminal peptide, AP1, exhibited an inhibitory effect
(Figure 5d). As expected, the longer peptide PP1 displayed a slightly more potent inhibitory
effect on the PIKE-A/Akt interaction than sp2, wheras the sp5 peptide had no effect at all
(Figure 5e). To assess whether the small peptide sp2 could disrupt the PIKE-A/Akt complex
in a time dependent manner, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with GST-PIKE-A and HAAkt, then treated the cells with 50- M sp2 for various time points and conducted a GST
pull-down assay. The sp2 peptide inhibited PIKE-A binding to Akt at 4 h. The inhibition
increased in a time-dependent manner and peaked at 16 h. At 24 h, the peptide lost its
suppressive activity (Figure 5f). Presumably, this peptide was degraded after 24-h
incubation in cell culture medium.
sp2 inhibits GBM cell viability, migration, invasion and colony formation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next sought to determine the effect of these smaller peptides on GBM cell survival,
migration, invasion and colony formation. To this end, we treated LN229 and LN-Z308 cells
with 50 M of the various small antagonistic peptides. The results from an MTT assay
demonstrated that sp2 and sp6 selectively decreased LN-Z308 cell viability, whereas sp4
had no effect. Interestingly, the reduction in viability caused by the sp2 and sp6 peptides was
only observed in LN-Z308 cells, not in LN229 cells (Figure 6a). Similar results were seen in
cell migration assays (Figure 6b). Conversely, sp2 strongly inhibited the invasive activity of
both LN229 and LN-Z308 cells. Notably, sp4 and sp6 did not significantly affect in invasive
activity of either cell line (Figure 6c). To determine whether the sp2 peptide acted additively
or synergistically with commonly used anti-cancer drugs on GBM cell viability, we treated
LN229 and LN-Z308 cells with TMZ (25 M) or BCNU (50 M) in the presence of various
concentration of sp2. The results from these assays revealed a suppressive activity of sp2 on
LN-Z308 cell viability, which occurred in a dose-dependent manner. However, its activity
towards LN229 cells was not as evident as in LN-Z308 cells. TMZ potently decreased both
LN-Z308 and LN229 cell viability and co-treatment with the sp2 peptide elicited an additive
effect in LN-Z308 cells. The inhibitory trend was similar in LN229 cells. Similar results on
cell viability were observed for co-treatment of sp2 peptide and BCNU (Figure 6d). To
assess the effect of sp2 on the colony formation inhibitory effects of TMZ and BCNU, we
treated GBM cells lines with TMZ or BCNU in the presence of various doses of sp2. The
results from the colony formation assays revealed that TMZ and BCNU decreased the
colony numbers of both cells. This effect was substantially increased by co-treatment with
50- M sp2 in LN-Z308 cells. The additive trend also applied in LN229 cells (Figure 6e).
Furthermore, similar observations were observed in TP366 cells, another CDK4 ampliconexpressing GBM cell line (Data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that a
small peptide from the PIKE-A N-terminus, sp2, can potently suppress brain cancer cell
viability, migration and invasion. Moreover, we have demonstrated that CDK4 ampliconcontaining cells are more sensitive to treatment with sp2.

sp2 inhibits the endogenous interaction between PIKE-A and Akt

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our studies indicate that sp2 strongly inhibits LN-Z308 cell viability, migration, invasion
and colony formation. This suppressive activity may occur through the ability of sp2 to
disrupt the PIKE-A/Akt interaction, leading to blockade of signaling cascades downstream
of Akt. To investigate this possibility, we treated LN-Z308 cells with different
concentrations of sp2 peptide, or sp4 peptide as a control. Co-immunoprecipitate assays
demonstrated that sp2 disrupts the association between endogenous PIKE-A/Akt in a dosedependent manner, whereas SP4 did not affect the PIKE-A/Akt interaction (Figure 7a). Our
previous studies demonstrate that PIKE-A is required for Akt activation.12,24
Immunoblotting analysis of peptide-treated cell lysates indicates that both Akt T308 and
S473 phosphorylation were diminished by sp2 peptide treatment in a dose-dependent
manner, whereas SP4 had no effect on Akt phosphorylation. These results support the
hypothesis that abolishment of the PIKE-A/Akt association leads to a reduction in Akt
activity. In agreement with these observations, the well-established downstream effectors of
Akt including mTOR, rpS6 and GSK3a exhibited the similar decreased phosphorylation
patterns after treatment with sp2 (Figure 7b). Collectively, these results indicate that
disruption of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction by the sp2 peptide decreases Akt activation and
thus signaling cascades downstream of Akt.

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The key finding of this report is that disruption of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction in GBM cells
by small antagonist peptides decreases cell viability, suppresses cell migration and invasion,
diminishes colony formation and additively enhances the effects of the commonly used
chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, we found that CDK4 amplicon-containing GBM cells
are more sensitive to the effects of the small peptides than the GBM cells without the CDK4
amplicon. Our previous studies established that a pronounced overexpression of PIKE-A in
a variety of human tumors and that the activation of Akt by PIKE-A contributed to the
progression of these tumors.12,13,17 In the current report, we provide compelling evidence to
demonstrate that inhibition of the interaction between PIKE-A and Akt substantially blocks
GBM cell viability, migration, invasion and colony formation. The small peptides we
identified from the N-terminus of PIKE-A provided us with a powerful tool to specifically
interrogate the biological actions of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction in cancer cell development.
The small peptide sp2 contains only 8 amino acids with molecular weight about 878.1 U.
This peptide effectively disrupts the endogenous PIKE-A/Akt associate in GBM cells,
resulting in the suppression of Akt signaling cascades. Our results indicate that sp2 might be
able to penetrate intact cells and exert its inhibitory effects by blocking the interaction
between PIKE-A and Akt.

PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade is commonly activated in many human malignancies,
including GBM. This pathway can be activated via numerous upstream alterations including
genomic amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor, PTEN deletion or PIK3CA
mutations. Akt promotes cell survival by inhibiting proteins that mediate apoptosis and by
upregulating proteins that inhibit apoptosis. For example, Akt phosphorylates the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member BAD,25,26 caspase-927 and apoptosis signal-regulating
kinase 1 (Ask1)28 and inhibits their pro-apoptotic functions. In addition, Akt is a crucial
factor in regulating diverse tumorigenic activities such as angiogenesis and tissue invasion/
metastasis.29 Inhibition of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling has been well characterized as a
therapeutic target for treating various human cancers including GBM. Nonetheless, Akt is
essential for a variety of molecular and cellular processes in normal cells. Direct blockade of
Akt might disturb numerous ordinary cellular processes and yield undesirable side effects.
The feasibility of targeting PPIs for functional studies has been well established. As an
increasing number of protein complexes and interconnected protein networks are revealed

by a variety of experimental approaches, general principles underlying PPIs and their roles
in controlling cellular processes have emerged. It appears that a general mode of PPI is
mediated by a contiguous stretch of amino-acid sequences or a defined structure to form
protein domains or modules within individual proteins.30 These protein domains or modules
offer tractable molecular targets for tool design and mechanistic interventions. For example,
molecular studies have mapped the MDM2/p53 interaction interfaces to a 15-residue helical region of p53, which has been extensively targeted for defining the oncogenic
properties of MDM2 in a number of tumors, including GBM. Thus, using a peptide
disruption approach is expected to identify critical PPIs in oncogenic signaling pathways in
GBM. The exciting data presented in this report provide a proof-of-concept that targeting a
crucial PPI in GBM may not only address its biological roles in cancer progression but also
establish a drug-screening target for cancer treatment. Here, we provide an alternative
approach to target Akt activation by disrupting the PIKE-A/Akt interaction. Conceivably,
targeting this PPI, instead of inhibiting Akt itself directly, might result in less severe side
effects. The small peptides identified in this study could be used as a template for in silico
screening to search for small molecules that may share a similar three-dimensional structure
as the 8-mer peptide, and thus specifically abolish the interaction between PIKE-A and Akt.
Conversely, the fluorescent live-cell image analysis could be used as a screening tool to
quantitatively screen small molecules to inhibit the PIKE-A/Akt interaction. The compounds
that are discovered through these studies may serve as positive hits for further drug
development for the treatment of cancer.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the present study, we have found that GBM cells that harbor the CDK4 amplicon are
more responsive to dissociation of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction than GBM cells without the
CDK4 amplicon (Figures 4 and 6). CDK4 amplicon contains CDK4, CENTG1, SAS and
OS9 genes. This amplicon is frequently amplified in numerous human cancers including
sarcoma, brain tumors, lung cancer, melanoma and so on.3 – 7 It often co-amplifies with the
oncogene MDM2. Presumably, these oncogenes coordinate with each other to upregulate
proliferative signals and enhance cancer cell growth and transformation. In addition, Cdks
have essential roles in regulating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. During the G1 phase,
Rb proteins are inactivated by sequential phosphorylation mediated by various Cdks, mainly
the D-type cyclin-dependent Cdk4 and Cdk6 and the E-type cyclin-dependent Cdk2.31
Inactivation of Rb proteins results in the release and/or activation of proteins, including E2F,
required for cell cycle progression. Conceivably, GBM cells with the CDK4 amplicon might
be more dependent on CDK4 and PIKE-A proteins to gain extra proliferation advantage.
The concomitant contribution of CDK4 and PIKE-A/Akt signaling to tumor progression
might provide a selective target for future personalized anti-cancer drug therapy. Taken
together, our study demonstrates the interrogation of a PPI in GBM using small peptides can
provide the biological roles of PPIs in cancer progression, which lays down the groundwork
for subsequent investigation of the PPI’s functions in tumorigenesis in animal models. This
knowledge paves the way for targeting the specific PPI for further drug screening and
development.

cells were 100% confluent, the monolayer was scratched using a 200- l pipette tip and
washed once to remove nonadherent cells. New medium containing the antagonist peptides
or DMSO was added (0 h) and allowed to incubate for 10 h. The cells were observed using a
light microscope. Inhibition of migration was assessed using Image J software, available
from the National Institutes of Health Web site (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The percent of

buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20). Peptides were add to
the wells (20 l/well) and incubated for 3 h at room temperature, followed by incubation
with HA-Akt-containing cytosolic extracts from transfected HEK293 cells diluted in wash
buffer for 4 h at room temperature. Akt binding was detected with biotin-conjugated Akt
antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (0.5 mg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch,
West Grove, PA, USA). Color development was stopped after 1 – 2 min by the addition of

PP1 and AP1 suppress GBM cell survival, colony formation, migration and invasion. (a)
Cell survival assay. Cells (1 × 105/well) were seeded in six-well plates. FuGENE HD
transfection reagent was used to transfect the cells with the peptides and vector plasmids.
After 40 h, a trypan blue exclusion assay was utilized to measure the viability of cells
transfected with the fusion peptide encoding plasmids. (b) Colony formation assay. The
potency of peptides was assessed further in an anchorage-independent environment using a
colony formation assay. Treatment with PP1 greatly decreased the ability of LN-Z308 cells
to form colonies in comparison with GST control. (c) A cell viability assay (MTT) was
conducted to determine the effect of the peptides and examine whether there was a
synergetic effect with BCNU or TMZ in LN229 cells. Cells (5 × 103/well) were seeded in
96-well plates followed by transfection with the indicated plasmid and vector. After 40 h,
the medium was replaced with medium containing BCUN (50 M) or TMZ (25 M).
Following 24 h of treatment, an MTT assay was employed to determine cell viability. (d)
PP1 and AP1 inhibited cell viability in LN-Z308 cells. Combined treatment of PP1 or AP1
with BCNU or TMZ enhanced the inhibition of BCNU/TMZ in LN-Z308 cells by MTT
assay as in (c). (e) Cells (1 × 105/well) were seeded in six-well plates. Peptides and vector
plasmids were transfected with FuGENE HD transfection reagent. After 40 h, cell migration

PP2 and AP1. (a) Sequence and number of amino acids of the small sp. (b). In vitro binding
assay as described in Figure 1. sp2, sp4, sp6 and sp9 inhibited the interaction of PIKE-A and
Akt. (c) An ELISA-based protein interaction assay was used to verify the ability of the small
peptides to inhibit PIKE-A and Akt binding. sp2, sp4 and sp6 significantly disrupted the
interaction of PIKE-A and Akt. Data of RLU (relative luminescence units) represent mean
±s.d. (*P<0.05, **P<0.01). (d) sp2 inhibited interaction of PIKE-A and Akt in living cells.
HEK293 cells were co-tranfected with HA-Akt and GST-PIKE-A, followed by treatment
with indicated concentrations of the sps. GST-PIKE-A was pulled down with glutathione
beads. The associated proteins were analyzed with an anti-HA antibody. GST-PIKE-A was
verified with anti-GST-HRP. Sp2 suppressed the interaction of PIKE-A and Akt in vivo. (e)
A GST-pull down assay as described in Figure 2 demonstrated that both PP1 and SP2
inhibited the binding of PIKE-A and Akt. (f) Time-course study of the effect of sp2 on the

analyzed by Image J software. (c) Cell invasion assay. Cells (1 × 105/well) were seeded in
six-well plates followed by treatment with the indicated peptides 16 h. Cell invasion was
determined using a transwell invasion assay described. (d) The effect of sp2 alone or in
combination with BCNU or TMZ, on cell viability. Cells (5 × 103/well) were seeded in 96well plates followed by treatment with sp2 in the absence or presence of BCNU/TMZ at the
indicated concentrations for 16 h. An MTT assay was performed to determine cell viability.

sp2 inhibits the endogenous interaction between PIKE-A and Akt and signaling downstream
of Akt. (a) co-immunoprecipitate assay was used to validate the effect of sp2 on the
interaction of PIKE-A and Akt. LN-Z308 cells were treated with the indicated concentration
of sp2 for 16 h. The cell lysate was collected and 1 mg of cell lysate was incubated with 1
g of rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt antibody. Thirty micrograms of whole cell lysate was used
as input. The coprecipitated proteins were analyzed with an anti-PIKE-A antibody. The
expression of PIKE-A and Akt were verified by immunoblot analysis. Sp2 inhibited the
interaction of PIKE-A and Akt in a dose-dependent manner. (b) sp2 affected Akt activity via
the disruption of PIKE-A/Akt. Activation of signaling downstream of Akt was detected
using immunoblotting analysis. Sp2 inhibited Akt activity and the phosphorylation of Akt
substrates, which is consistent with the disruption of the interaction between PIKE-A and
Akt.
