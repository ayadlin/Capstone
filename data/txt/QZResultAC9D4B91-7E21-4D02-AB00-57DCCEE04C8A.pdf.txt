ABSTRACT
In this study, neural stem cells (NSCs)-derived enzyme/prodrug therapy (NDEPT)
was used to treat primary lung cancer or metastatic lung cancer in the brain. To
confirm the anti-tumor effect of NSCs expressing carboxyl esterase (CE), A549 lung
cancer cells were treated with HB1.F3.CE cells and CPT-11. A significant decrease in
the viability/proliferation of lung cancer cells was observed compared to negative
controls or cells treated with CPT-11 alone. To produce a mouse model of primary
lung cancer or lung cancer metastasis to the brain, A549 cells were implanted in the
dorsal area of the mouse or right hemisphere. CM-DiI pre-stained stem cells were
implanted near the primary lung cancer tumor mass or in the contralateral brain. Two
days after stem cells injection, mice were inoculated with CPT-11 (13.5 kg/mouse/
day) via intraperitoneal injection. In the primary lung cancer mouse models, tumor
mass was 80% lower in response to HB1.F3.CE in conjunction with CPT-11, while
it was only reduced by 40% in the group treated with CPT-11 alone. Additionally,
therapeutic efficacy of co-treatment with stem cells and CPT-11 was confirmed by
detection of apoptosis and necrosis in primary and metastatic lung cancer tissues.
By secreting VEGF, tumor cells modulate Erk1/2 and Akt signaling and migration of
stem cells. This further increased tumor-selectivity of stem cell/prodrug co-therapy.
Overall, these results indicate that NSCs expressing the therapeutic gene may be a
powerful tool for treatment of primary lung cancer or metastasis of lung cancer to
the brain.

tissue regeneration. Directed cell migration is initiated
in response to various cytokines and growth factors,
and receptors such as stromal cell derived factor
(SDF-1α)/CXCR4, stem cell factor (SCF)/c-Kit, and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR
have been shown to affect stem cell migration [4]. In a
previous study, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activity
on mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from
bone marrow was investigated in terms of proliferation,
migration and cell differentiation [5]. Additionally, several
signal pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt signaling regulate survival, proliferation,
differentiation, and migration of stem cells [6].

INTRODUCTION
Neural stem cells (NSCs) that have the capacity
to self-renew and differentiate into neurons and glia
can be grown from adult subventricular zones (SVZ)
[1]. In the adult brain, NSCs exist in two regions, the
SVZ of the lateral ventricle, and the subgranular zone
of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Neurogenesis occurs
continuously in these regions [2]. NSCs have been
shown to migrate to areas of injury site as well as brain
pathological areas, such as ischemic and neoplastic
lesions [3]. Therefore, migration of endogenous and
exogenous NSCs to areas of pathology is critical to

Akt regulates proliferation of embryonic mouse NSCs
and neuronal differentiation by affecting the cell cycle
regulators cyclin D, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p27Kip1, and p21Cip1/Waf1 [7]. Increased Akt activity
via elevated phosphorylation of PI3K promotes stem cells
migration in vitro and in vivo, as well as proliferation and
apoptotic signaling [8]. Inhibition of PI3K by LY294002,
a selective PI3K inhibitor, decreases neural progenitor
cell proliferation and migration [9]. Moreover, MSCs
demonstrate an increased migratory propensity in the
presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) through
a PI3K/Akt pathway [10].
VEGF is a critical mediator of angiogenesis and
tumor proliferation that is frequently overexpressed in a
variety of cancers [11]. In another study, transplantation
of VEGF-expressing NSCs provided neuroprotection
against hemorrhage and improved functional recovery
in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) animal models [12].
An investigation of VEGF and platelet-derived growth
factor alpha/beta (PDGFαβ) also showed that VEGF
could stimulate migration through the PDGF receptor,
confirming the intricacies involved in the signaling
induction [13]. In another study, inhibition of neurogenesis
in the dentate gyrus of adult mice by blocking VEGFR2
significantly impaired animal learning capability [14].
NSCs-based therapies for Parkinson’s disease,
Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury
and primary and metastatic cancer metastasis to the brain
have been successfully developed based on these principles
[15]. The efficacy of modalities employing NSCs-directed
enzyme/prodrug therapy (NDEPT) has been examined in
various animal models of human primary and metastatic
cancers [16]. Enzyme/prodrug therapy can be designed
to selectively target tumor cells over normal cells, which
can minimize side-effects [17]. Several types of enzymes
employed in enzyme/prodrug therapy are capable to
converting non-toxic prodrugs into toxic agents, including
cytosine deaminase (CD) and carboxyl esterase (CE) [18].
The CE gene is most widely used to promote formation of
SN-38 from irinotecan (CPT-11) [19]. The active form,
SN-38, is a strong mammalian topoisomerase I inhibitor
that is 1,000-fold more potent then CPT-11 and induces
the accumulation of double strand DNA breaks in dividing
cancer cells [20]. In a previous study, treatment with CPT11 not only decreased the number of HB1.F3.CE cells,
but also inhibited the growth of untransfected neighboring
ovarian cancer cells [21].
In this study, we employed an immortalized HB1.
F3 and HB1.F3.CE expressing CE gene for treatment of
primary and metastatic lung cancer. Lung cancer is the
second most frequent type of tumor and a major problem
in human health [22]. Of all malignancies, primary lung
cancer has the highest incidence of brain metastasis,
and approximately 40% of all patients with lung cancer
develop such metastasis [23]. Metastatic lung cancer
is a debilitating disease that results in a high burden of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

symptoms and poor quality of life with an estimated
prognosis after diagnosis of less than one year [24, 25].
The goal of the current study was to examine the effects of
NSCs expressing therapeutic genes with prodrug treatment
on primary and metastatic lung cancer to the brain. Thus,
therapeutic efficacy of HB1.F3.CE in the presence of a
prodrug, CPT-11, was investigated in the primary and
metastatic mouse models by diverse molecular methods.
In addition to therapeutic effects, the migratory ability of
HB1.F3.CE was observed by a transwell migration assay
in vitro and in vivo. We also elucidated the mechanism of
migratory properties related to VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling
by regulating the expression of the downstream proteins,
Erk1/2 and Akt. Overall, the results of this study suggested
that NDEPT using cells expressing the CE gene may be
an excellent therapeutic system for selective targeting of
metastatic lung cancer to the brain, as well as primary lung
cancer.

RESULTS
Antitumor effect of HB1.F3.CE and CPT-11
in A549 lung cancer cells
Therapeutic NSCs expressing the CE gene, HB1.
F3.CE cells, were used to investigate whether growth
of A549 lung cancer cells is reduced in response to
co-treatment with stem cells and the prodrug, CPT-11. To
accomplish this, we tested the expression of rabbit CE
gene in stem cells by RT-PCR. HB1.F3.CE cells expressed
the exogenous CE gene at 237 bp (Fig. 1A). Cell viability
of A549 lung cancer cells was measured by MTT assay
following co-culture with CPT-11 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5,
1.0, or 10.0 μg/ml. In the CPT-11 only treated group, low
levels of CPT-11 (0.1 μg/ml) did not alter the proliferation
of A549 lung cancer cells, whereas growth of stem
cells and prodrug co-treated cells was reduced by 35%
under the same conditions (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the
proliferation rate of cancer cells was significantly inhibited
by 60% in the co-treated group relative to the CPT-11
single treated group, in which proliferation was reduced
by approximately 40% in response to high concentrations
of CPT-11 (1.0 μg/ml). Moreover, to explain the cytotoxic
of CPT-11 on cancer cells in the absence of the stem cells,
we identified the endogenous human CE gene in A549
lung cancer cells at 182 bp (Fig. 1C).

Inhibition of tumor growth by HB1.F3.CE
and CPT-11
To determine whether HB1.F3.CE inhibited the
growth of primary lung cancer mass, an animal study using
BALB/c nude mice was performed with stem cells and
CPT-11. As shown in Figure 2A, A549 lung cancer cells
were injected into the dorsal area of the mouse and then
co-treated with stem cells/CPT-11 during the experimental

period. Lung cancer tumor burden was reduced in the
CPT-11+/−HB1.F3.CE treated groups relative to the
negative control group (Fig. 2B). Differences in tumor
mass were observed at three weeks following treatments
with the stem cells and a prodrug. Following treatment
for four weeks, tumor volume was significantly reduced
by 80% in the HB1.F3.CE with CPT-11 co-treated group,
whereas it was only reduced by 40% in CPT-11 treated
mice (Fig. 2C).

We also investigated expression of the proliferation
marker, PCNA protein, by IHC staining of tissue
specimens. Proliferative tumor cells displayed strong
nuclear staining in the negative control group relative to
the CPT-11+/−HB1.F3.CE cell treated group (Fig. 3D).
Specifically, the relative value of PCNA expression was
significantly decreased by 70% in the tumor burden of
HB1.F3.CE and CPT-11 treated mice (Fig. 3E).

We next tested whether the stem cells migrated
toward lung cancer burden using a fluorescence
analysis. Before injection of stem cells into the mice,
HB1.F3.CE cells were stained with red fluorescent
CM-DiI. No red fluorescence labeled stem cells were
detected in the negative control and CPT-11 single treated
groups (Figs. 4A and B). However, red fluorescence was
observed in the tumor burden of the HB1.F3.CE and
CPT-11 treated group (Fig. 4C).

To further analyze the effects of stem cells
expressing therapeutic genes, H&E staining of tumor
mass obtained from the mice was conducted. In the
negative control, features of tumor cells such as aggressive
tendency, high density, and large nuclear inner cancer cells
were observed (Fig. 3A). Conversely, apoptosis or necrosis
of lung cancer cells was observed in the CPT-11+/−HB1.
F3.CE cell treated mice (Fig. 3B). Additionally, features
of necrosis and apoptosis such as nuclear pyknosis,
karyorrhexis, and karyolysis occurred more frequently
in HB1.F3.CE cells and CPT-11 co-treated mice relative
to those treated with CPT-11 alone (Fig. 3C). Moreover,
the density of tumor cells was significantly reduced in the
co-treated group owing to dissolution of the nucleus.

hemisphere of the brain (Fig. 5A). At 2 weeks after
inoculation, red fluorescence labeled HB1.F3.CE cells
were injected into the left hemisphere and prodrug was
administered via the abdominal cavity. The antitumor
effect of CPT-11 and HB1.F3.CE cells was evaluated at
4 weeks after initial lung cancer cells were injected. Upon
histological analysis, tumor burden was detected in the all
of mouse brain and differences were observed between
normal brain tissues and lung cancer cells (Fig. 5B).

cancer cells were injected into the right hemisphere
and pre-stained HB1.F3.CE cells were injected into
the opposite site of the brain. No red fluorescence was
detected near the tumor burden in the right hemisphere of
the mouse brains in the control (Fig. 5D), while red spots
were observed in the HB1.F3.CE plus CPT-11 co-treated
group by fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 5E).

Role of VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling
To explain the migratory ability of stem cells
against tumor cells, several chemoattractant factors
including uPA, SDF-1α, VEGF, MCP-1, and SCF were
examined and quantified by real time PCR in A549
lung cancer cells (Fig. 6A). In this study, A549 lung
cancer cells mainly secreted uPA, VEGF, MCP-1, and
SCF. We also confirmed that VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling
induced the migration of HB1.F3.CE cells toward A549
lung cancer cells by a VEGFR2 inhibition assay. Before
transwell assay of cancer and stem cells, stem cells were

We observed a dramatic increase in p-Erk1/2 protein
in response to treatment with 50 or 100 μM KRN633
(Figs. 7B and C). Conversely, selective downregulation
of endogenous VEGFR2 led to decreased Akt
phosphorylation in stem cells within one hour of inhibitor
treatment (Fig. 7D). The rate of Akt phosphorylation
was increased at 60 min after treatment of stem cells
with KRN633. The relative value of c-fos protein did not
change significantly in response to KRN633 treatment
(data not shown).

Mechanism of inhibition of migratory effects
via Erk1/2 and Akt

DISCUSSION

To determine the effects of VEGF/VEGFR2
signaling in stem cells, we inhibited VEGFR2 using a
KRN633. To accomplish this, 50 or 100 μM KRN633
was applied to pre-cultured stem cells for 0, 30, and
60 min before protein extraction. To confirm the alteration
of VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling via KRN633 treatment,
we assessed several downstream proteins related to

The development of an effective and safe therapy
for primary or metastatic cancers is one of the major
challenges in the treatment of cancer [26]. In this study,
we focused on the antitumor effects of therapeutic NSCs,
which are known to have the ability to convert prodrugs
to the active form. A cell viability assay confirmed the
effects of the CE gene expressed in HB1.F3.CE cells on

A549 lung cancer cells. Specifically, cancer cell viability
decreased significantly by 80%, whereas viability of
cancer cells treated with CPT-11 alone was reduced to
approximately 40%. CPT-11 is classified as a non-toxic
prodrug and a carbamate that is hydrolyzed by CEs to
yield SN-38 [27]. Typically, less than 5% of the drug is
converted into the active form, SN-38, when CPT-11 is
administered to humans [28]. In mice, more than 50%
of the CPT-11 is hydrolyzed to SN-38 within the first
hour of treatment [29]. The reason for this discrepancy
may be differences in the levels of CE gene expression
among species or the proficiency of drug hydrolysis of
the different CE genes. We selected the rabbit CE gene
for NDPET because structural similarity was observed
between rabbit CE and human CE (81% amino-acid
identity) [30]. In this study, reduction of cell viability in

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CTP-11 single treated cells may have occurred owing
to the weak expression of the CE gene. This study also
demonstrated the effects of HB1.F3.CE plus CPT-11 on
the mouse model for primary lung cancer and lung cancer
metastasis to the brain. In the primary lung cancer models,
therapeutic stem cells dramatically inhibited tumor growth
by up to 80% in the presence of CPT-11, while CPT-11
alone led to a 40% reduction.
Upon histopathological analysis, we frequently
observed apoptosis and necrosis-related features, as
well as a reduction of tumor cell density in the tissue
specimen of primary and metastatic lung cancer animal
models upon H&E staining. In the second approach, we
used IHC staining to detect proliferative cells in tissue
specimens. A nearly 2.5-fold reduction in the number
of PCNA-positive cells per section was observed in the

administered by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) for five days. After final prodrug injection, all of the mouse brain was excised and the

IHC staining to compare inhibition of tumor burden in
response to treatment with CPT-11 alone and observed
a decrease of up to 40% when compared with negative
control mice. Together, these two sets of histological data
indicated a dramatic reduction in cancer mass during stem
cell therapy in the presence of CPT-11. Similar to the in
vitro results, the therapeutic effects of CPT-11 may be
induced by endogenous CE gene in vivo assay.
Moreover, the migratory effect of HB1.F3.CE cells
was shown in primary and metastatic lung cancer animal
models upon fluorescence analysis. DM-DiI pre-stained
HB1.F3.CE cells were inoculated into areas near the

hemisphere of the brain in the metastatic cancer model
and red-fluorescence was detected in each tumor mass.
The tumor tropic effect of NSCs expressing therapeutic
genes has been investigated in various xenograft mouse
models and cancer cells, such as pancreatic, cervical
and gastric cancers, as well as brain tumors [31–33].
To evaluate the mechanism of the migratory effects, we
investigated whether several chemoattractant factors
induced the migration of stem cells secreted by A549
lung cancer cells. In a previous study, specific migration
of MSCs was reportedly guided by chemokines [34].
Moreover, other researchers reported that signaling
by SDF-1α and their receptor, CXCR4, is important
to regulation of the migration of different types of

stem/progenitor cells [35]. In this study, real-time PCR
analysis demonstrated that A549 lung cancer cells
expressed several factors, including uPA, VEGF, MCP-1,
and SCF. Yi et al. and others reported that some receptors
were mainly expressed in HB1.F3 cells, including uPArelated receptor (uPAR), VEGFR2, and SCF-related
receptor (c-Kit) [19, 36]. Therefore, we investigated
whether the migratory effects of stem cells toward
cancer cells were mediated through VEGF/VEGFR2
signaling due to induction by various cancer cells. VEGF
is an angiogenic factor known to be a primary factor
involved in angiogenesis [37]. VEGF-targeted therapies
were initially developed with the notion that they would
inhibit new blood vessels in patients with advanced-stage
malignancies [38]. In the present study, VEGF/VEGFR2
signaling was inhibited by pretreatment of HB1.F3.CE
cells with 100 μM KRN633 for one hour before in vitro
migration assay. Evaluation of migrated HB1.F3.CE cells
by fluorescence microscopy revealed that the number of
stem cells was significantly decreased by 75% in inhibitor
treated stem cells.
Furthermore, alteration of VEGF/VEGFR2-related
downstream proteins was investigated following KRN633
treatment. Interestingly, we found that phosphorylation

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of Erk1/2 was induced and phosphorylation of Akt was
decreased in stem cells via inhibition of VEGF/VEGFR2
signaling at early time. In the previous study, neural
progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiation and migration was
paralleled by changes in the phosphorylation of Erk1/2,
which is involved in a wide range of functions including
regulation of neurogenesis [39]. Additionally, Shinjyo
et al. reported that SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling stimulated
NPCs migration through Erk signaling [40]. In addition to
migration, Erk1/2 played an important role in regulation
of the differentiation and proliferation of NSCs, which
was mediated by Cdk2, cyclin D, and Hes1 protein [41].
Therefore, these findings suggest that increased p-Erk1/2
appears to be related with the differentiation status
rather than migration ability of stem cells after VEGF/
VEGFR2 signaling inhibition. In the case of Akt protein,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increased the
phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream target of the PI3K
pathway; however, this enhanced effect was abolished
when neural stem/progenitor cells were pre-treated with
the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 [42]. In this study, we
found that Akt was dephosphorylated at early time and
phosphorylated at later time following the treatment with
a VEGFR2 inhibitor in the stem cells, suggesting that

12843

Oncotarget

the migratory ability of NSCs may be inhibited via Akt
dephosphorylation at early time and activation of Erk1/2
in MAPK pathways may induce Akt re-phosphorylation
to influence the differentiation of stem cells at later time.
Taken together, the migratory effects of stem cells were
regulated by the downstream VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling
factors, PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2, in this study.
In summary, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate
that stem cells expressing the therapeutic gene CE, HB1.
F3.CE cells, display therapeutic effects towards primary
and metastatic lung cancer to the brain. In the presence of
low levels of CPT-11, SN-38 may be efficiently converted
by the CE gene with minimal side effects. Additionally,
the mechanism of the migratory ability of stem cells
suggests that VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling, one of several
chemoattractant factors secreted by the cancer cells, may
play an important role in migration through regulation of
Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, stem cells
expressing a therapeutic gene have therapeutic potential
for treatment of metastatic cancer and primary cancer as
an efficient delivery vehicle for therapeutic genes.

540 nm using a VERSA man microplate reader (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The percent cell viability
was plotted using GraphPad Prism (v5.0; GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Each data point indicates
the average of triplicate measurements (n = 12).

Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR
and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from A549 lung cancer
cells using TRIzol RNA extraction solution (Invitrogen
Lift Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, 1 µg of
RNA from HB1.F3.CE and A549 lung cancer cells was
reverse transcribed with murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase (MMLV-RT; iNtRON Biotechnology,
Sungnam, Kyeonggido, Korea), 10 pM dNTP (Bioneer,
Deajeon, Korea), 200 pM monomer random primer
(TaKaRa Bio., Shiga, Japan), 5 × RT buffer (iNtRON
Biotechnology) and RNase inhibitor (iNtRON
Biotechnology). cDNA was then synthesized at 37°C
for one hour, after which the reaction was stopped by
incubation at 95°C for 5 min.
The cDNA produced from the extracted total RNA
of HB1.F3.CE and A549 lung cancer cells was amplified
by PCR to confirm the expression of human or rabbit
CE genes. The reaction mixture contained 2.5 Units Taq
polymerase (iNtRON Biotechnology), 5 pM dNTP, 10 ×
PCR buffer (iNtRON Biotechnology), and 10 pM of each
primer set (Table 1). PCR was conducted by subjecting the
samples to the following conditions: denaturation at 95°C
for 30 s, annealing at 58°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C
for 30 s for 30 cycles. The RT-PCR products were resolved
on 1.5% agarose gels by electrophoresis, stained with
ethidium bromide (EtBr, Sigma-Aldrich Co.), visualized
on a UV transilluminator, and photographed digitally
using the Gel Doc 2000 apparatus (BioRad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA). Expression of glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a
loading control.
To quantify the expression of chemoattractant
factors such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator
(uPA), SDF-1α, VEGF, monocyte chemotactic protein
1 (MCP-1), and SCF in A549 lung cancer cells, cDNA
was quantified by real time PCR, which was conducted
using a 2 × SYBR green premix (TaKaRa Bio.), ROX dye
(TaKaRa Bio.), and reverse and forward primers and the
following reaction conditions (Table 1): denaturation at

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The lung cancer cell line, A549, was obtained
from the Korea cell line bank (KCLB, Seoul, Korea)
and grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(DMEM; Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT, USA)
supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone Laboratory Inc.), antibiotic
agent consisting of 100 Unit/ml penicillin and 100 μg/
ml streptomycin (Cellgro Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA,
USA) and 10 mM HEPES (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Immortalized human NSCs, HB1.F3.CE cells, were
provided by Chungang University (Seoul, Korea) and
incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100
Unit/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mM
HEPES and 0.1% antimycoplasmal agents (Invivogen,
San Diego, CA, USA). All cell lines were incubated at
37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere and subcultured
using 0.05% trypsin/0.02% EDTA (Gibco).

Therapeutic effects of HB1.F3.CE and CPT-11
against lung cancer cells
Lung cancer cell viability was measured by an
MTT assay according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
Briefly, A549 lung cancer cells (1650 cells/well/100  μl
media) were placed in a 96-well plate, and then
incubated overnight at 37°C. The next day, HB1.F3.CE
(3350 cells/well/100 μl media) or vehicle (medium) was
added to the existing cancer cells in the 96-well plate.
We then applied different concentrations of CPT-11

perchlorate (CM-DiI; Invitrogen Life Technologies). A
prodrug, CPT-11 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), was injected into
the mice with HB1.F3.CE cells for 11 days after stem cell
injection. It was given via an intraperitoneal injection at a
dose 13.5 mg/kg/day in 100 μL of saline. Tumor sizes were
measured with a caliper and calculated every week using
the following formula: length × width × height × 0.5236.
The mice were sacrificed 48 h after the last treatment and
the tumor masses were then excised for histopathological
analysis.

Primary lung cancer mouse models
In this study, six-week-old male BALB/c nude mice
were purchased from Central Laboratory Animal (Seoul,
Korea). All protocols involving animals were reviewed
and approved by the Animal Care Committee of Chungbuk
National University and performed in accordance with the
guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. The
mice were cared for under a pathogen free environment with
a 12 h light/dark cycle and frequent ventilation. Additionally,
all mice were freely fed autoclaved rodent diet (Central Lab.
Animal Inc.) and distilled water. A549 lung cancer cells
(2 × 106 cells/100 μL/mouse) suspended in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) were subcutaneously injected with
matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA)
into the dorsal area. When the volume of the tumor
burden reached 200 mm3, the 24 mice were randomly
divided into three groups: 1) HB1.F3.CE and CPT-11
treated group, 2) CPT-11 treated group, and 3) negative
control (untreated with stem cells or prodrug). On week 5
post-inoculation, an HB1.F3.CE suspension containing
4 × 106 cells was injected two times into the nearby lung
cancer burden (at day 35 and 49). Prior to injection, stem
cells pre-stained with 2 μM chloromethylbenzamide-1,
1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine

Xenograft model of lung cancer metastasis
to brain
A total of 21 six-week old male nude mice were
purchased from Central Laboratory Animal. A549 lung
cancer cells (1 × 105 cells/8 μl/mouse) were directly
implanted into the white matter of the right hemisphere
[anterior/posterior (AP) +1.0 mm, medial/lateral (ML)
+1.7 mm, dorsal/ventral (DV) -3.2 mm] to produce
metastatic lung cancer models. Two weeks later, 21 mice
were randomly divided into three groups: 1) HB1.F3.CE
and CPT-11 treated group, 2) CPT-11 treated group, and 3)
a negative control (untreated with stem cells or prodrug).
Mice in the HB1.F3.CE and CPT-11 treated group had
2 μM CM-DiI pre-stained HB1.F3.CE at 1 × 105 cells/
mice injected into the left hemisphere of the brain. CPT-11
(13.5 mg/kg/day; Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was then
administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) once a day, 5 days per
week for 2 weeks.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
fluorescence analysis

pre-stained stem cells were seeded in the upper chamber
of the transwell and incubated for one day. Dose response
comparison of the effects of 100 μM of the VEGFR2
inhibitor, KRN633 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA),
on migratory properties of HB1.F3.CE stem cells was
conducted before seeding the transwells. Inhibitor
was applied to the stem cells culture dish for one hour,
detached from the culture plate through trypsin/EDTA
treatment, and then cultured in the upper chamber of
transwell. Following stem cells incubation, non-migrated
cells were removed from the transwell using a cotton swab
and migrated stem cells were fixed in cold methanol for
ten min. Red fluorescent stem cells was then detected
by fluorescence microscopy (IX71 inverted microscope;
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

The tumor burdens and brains were collected
after sacrificing the mice, fixed in 4% normal formalin
(Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and embedded in paraffin blocks.
Next, 3 μm sections were cut using a sliding microtome,
after which the tumor burdens and brains were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). The
sections were then examined for apoptosis, necrosis and
other histological aspects. Additionally, the fluorescence
of the migrated stem cells in the tumor burden and brain
were evaluated by DAPI (4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole;
Sigma-Aldrich Co.) staining at 200 ng/ml. Stem cells
were pre-stained with 2 μM CM-DiI (Invitrogen Life
Technologies) staining solution and injected into primary
and metastatic lung cancer animal models. DAPI staining
was applied as a counterstain on the slide. All stained
slides were observed by light microscopy using a BX51
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Immunoblotting
HB1.F3.CE cells were plated in DMEM medium
containing 10% FBS at densities of 1.0 × 105 cells/
dish in 60 mm3 dishes and incubated overnight at
37°C. The following day, cells were exposed to 50 or
100 μM KRN633 in medium for one hour. Dishes were
then washed twice with 1 × phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) within one hour, after which 1 x RIPA protein
extraction solution (mixed with 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH  8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic
acid, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) was added.
Extracted proteins were subsequently quantified by
bicinchoninic acid (BCA; Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and
copper (II) sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), after which
40 µg of protein was size fractionated by 12% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) transfer membrane (BioRad Laboratories Inc.).
Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in
Tris-buffered saline-0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T, BioRad
Laboratories Inc.) and probed with anti-phospho-Erk1/2
(1:1,000 dilution, Cell signaling Technology, Inc.,
Danvers, MA, USA ), anti-phospho-Akt (1:1,000 dilution,
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-c-fos (1:2,000
dilution, Abcam plc.), and anti- GAPDH (1:1,000 dilution,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. CA, USA) primary IgG
antibodies. After overnight incubation with primary
antibodies, membranes were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase linked goat anti-rabbit (1:3000 dilution, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-mouse (1:3000 dilution,
BioRad Laboratories Inc.) secondary IgG antibody for
2 h. The proteins were then detected using an enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (West-Q Chemiluminescent
Substrate Plus Kit, GenDEPOT, Barker, TX, USA).
Intensity values were determined with the Quantity
One analysis program (BioRad Laboratories), and the
percentage of protein was normalized against cells that
were not treated with KRN633. Finally, data were plotted
using the GraphPad prism software package.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
IHC of the specimen slides prepared from primary
lung cancer mice was conducted. To expose the antigen
in tissues, antigen retrieval was conducted by placing
samples in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and microwaving
for 10 min. Next, samples were incubated with 0.3%
methanol/hydrogen peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) for
30 min at room temperature to quench the endogenous
peroxidase. Slides were then blocked using 5% bovine
albumin serum (BAS, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) supplemented
10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature, then washed twice
in 1 × phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05%
Tween 20. Samples were subsequently incubated with a
primary mouse monoclonal antibody against proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, 1:100, Abcam, plc.,
Cambridge, UK) for overnight at 4°C. After four washes
for 10 min in PBS-Tween, the slides were incubated in
the biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500
dilution, Vector Laboratories) solution for 30 min at 37°C.
To form the immunoreactive complex, ABC kit reagent
(Vectastain Universal Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories)
was treated at each slide for 30 min. After DAB substrate
(Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and hematoxylin staining solution
treatment, all slides were detected under a BX51 light
microscope for digital photography.

Transwell assay
Transwell migration was performed to determine the
migration abilities of HB1.F3.CE cells. Briefly, A549 lung
cancer cells were seeded in 24-well plates and incubated
at 37°C for one day. After fibronectin (concentration
250 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) pre-coating of the bottom
of a transwell (8 μM pore, BD Biosciences), CM-DiI
