BACKGROUND: A randomized controlled trial tested the hypothesis that aggressive initial therapy using
high-dose cyclophosphamide (HiCy) and a2b interferon (IFN) may be superior to standard combination alkylating agent regimens in the treatment of newly diagnosed myeloma. METHODS: This Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial evaluated 268 previously untreated patients with active multiple myeloma
randomized to vincristine, carmustine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (VBMCP) or VBMCP
plus HiCy and recombinant IFN. RESULTS: The overall objective response was 62% in the VBMCP regimen
and 68% in the VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN group. The near complete response and complete response rates were
8.1% and 8.9%, respectively. Progression-free survival was 22.1 and 25.3 months, respectively. The median
overall survival was 37.1 months for patients treated with VBMCP and 41.3 months for those treated with
VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN (P ¼.38). The 5-year overall survival rates were not significantly different between the
2 arms: 26.4% and 33%, respectively. Lethal toxicities occurred in 15 patients, including 10 from infection,
but there was no significant difference in lethal toxicities between the 2 regimens. CONCLUSIONS: The
study showed no significant benefit with the addition of HiCy and IFN to VBMCP. Cancer 2009;115:2155–

than 50%, the median duration of response approximately 1.5 years, and the median survival about 2.5 years.24
Over the years, numerous studies have attempted to
improve on MP as initial therapy for myeloma. These regimens have included VBMCP (vincristine, carmustine
[BCNU], melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone)2,5,6 and ABCM (doxorubicin [Adriamycin], BCNU,
cyclophosphamide, and melphalan),7 as well as many
others. However, in randomized trials, combinations of
chemotherapy did not achieve a survival advantage compared with MP in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma.8,9 A meta-analysis of 18 published trials found no
difference in overall survival in a comparison of single and
multiple alkylating agents, but those with unfavorable prognostic factors did better when treated with a combination of
alkylating agents.10 In another meta-analysis of 4930
patients from 20 prospective trials in which individual
patient data were evaluated, there was no difference in overall survival when treatment with melphalan and prednisone
was compared with a variety of combinations of chemotherapy.11 Nevertheless, many investigators believed that combination chemotherapy with regimens such as VBMCP
were safe and more effective at rapid disease control and
relief of symptoms compared with MP, particularly in
patients with aggressive, symptomatic myeloma.
Besides combination chemotherapy such as
VBMCP, other approaches to improve on MP consisted
of incorporating interferon into initial therapy, as well
as high-dose cyclophosphamide (HiCy). In 1 study,
recombinant a22b interferon (IFN) produced responses
in 7 of 14 previously untreated myeloma patients.12 In
another study, the combination of MP and natural a-IFN
produced a response rate of 66% compared with 48%
from those receiving only MP in a prospective trial of 220
previously untreated MM patients. In a prospective Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) phase 2 trial,
58 patients with previously untreated MM were given 2
cycles of VBMCP followed by alternating 3-week cycles
of VBMCP and IFN for 2 years. Objective response was
seen in 80% of patients, including a complete response
(CR) in 30%. An additional 9 patients had a near-complete response, and the median survival was 42 months for
all patients.13 These studies supported further testing of
interferon in newly diagnosed myeloma. Similarly, an
ECOG study established that HiCy, administered at a
dose of 600 mg/m2 intravenously (iv) daily  4 days,
2156

produced a 38% objective response rate in 42 heavily pretreated myeloma patients,14 lending support to further
trials of this strategy.
The purpose of this trial (E5A93) was to assess the
efficacy of VBMCP versus VBMCP plus HiCy and IFN
in previously untreated MM patients. We hypothesized
that the addition of HiCy would produce a higher quality
response, and that the addition of recombinant IFN
would serve to prolong duration of response and improve
survival. Furthermore, the duration of chemotherapy was
shorter than the usual standard, and a secondary aim was
to evaluate whether such an approach would result in a
lower incidence of myelodysplasia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection and Accrual
This study was conducted as ECOG protocol EST-E5A93
between April 1994 and December 2002. Eligibility
required a new diagnosis of MM confirmed by either bone
marrow plasmacytosis of at least 10% or biopsy-proven
plasmacytoma as well as documented M protein in either
serum or urine or characteristic osteolytic bone lesions.
Measurable disease consisted of a serum M-protein level
>1 g/dL and urine monoclonal light chain excretion >200
mg/24 hours or measurable soft tissue plasmacytoma.
Patients with prior chemotherapy, smoldering multiple
myeloma, localized plasmacytoma, or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance were excluded.
Patients were required to have adequate organ and marrow
function as defined by absolute neutrophils 1000 mm3;
platelets 50,000 mm3; creatinine 5.0 mg/dL; bilirubin
2 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase 2.5 times upper
limit of normal; and alkaline phosphatase 2.5 times
upper limit of normal. Written informed consent was
obtained from each patient before entry.

Treatment Plan
Step 1 (induction) consisted of VBMCP (vincristine 1.2
mg/m2 [not to exceed 2.0 mg] iv on Day 1, BCNU 20
mg/m2 iv on Day 1, melphalan 8 mg/m2 orally [po] on
Days 1-4, cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m2 iv on Day 1,
and prednisone 40 mg/m2 po on Days 1-7). After 2 cycles

of VBMCP given 35 days apart, patients entered Step 2
(consolidation).
In Step 2, patients were randomized to Arm A, which
consisted of VBMCP as above every 35 days, or Arm B
(VBMCP þ HiCy 600 mg/m2 iv on Days 1-4 plus prednisone 100 mg/m2 po on Days 1-4 on cycles 3 and 5) (Fig.
1). VBMCP was administered every even cycle starting
with cycle 4, and IFN was given every odd cycle starting
with cycle 7 at a dose of 5.0  106 U/m2 3 times weekly
for 10 doses each cycle. Patients who obtained a plateau or
complete response within 1 year continued treatment until
1 year from study entry. If a plateau or CR was achieved after 1 year, patients received 2 additional cycles of VBMCP
and 2 cycles of IFN in arm B. Stratification factors included
serum creatinine <2.0 mg/dL and 2.0-5.0 mg/dL; performance status 0-1 and 2-4; plasma cell labeling index
<2% and 2%; and beta-2 microglobulin <4 lg/mL and
4 lg/mL. Treatment was discontinued in all patients at 2
years. Patients who had documented unequivocal progression or intolerable toxicity were removed from the study.
All patients were observed until relapse or disease progression. Patients who relapsed or progressed after 3 months or
more on observation received reinduction with their initial
randomized regimen.
Ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) was strongly
encouraged after each HiCy cycle. Granulocyte–colonystimulating factor 5 lg/kg was given subcutaneously beginning on Day 5 of each HiCy cycle and continued until
the absolute neutrophil count reached 1000/mm3.
Dose Modification
The initial cycle of chemotherapy was given at full dose
regardless of blood counts. However, patients with creatinine

2.0 to 5.0 mg/dL received a 50% reduction of the calculated
dosage for melphalan, BCNU, and cyclophosphamide. For
second and subsequent cycles of chemotherapy, dosage modifications for melphalan, BCNU, and cyclophosphamide
were calculated according to the leukocyte, neutrophil, and
platelet values. There was no dose modification for the 2
HiCy courses. IFN dosage was modified depending on the
level of toxicity. Toxicity was evaluated using standard
ECOG criteria.15 All patients were followed to document
the occurrence of a second malignancy.
Response was evaluated using ECOG criteria. The
criteria for objective response required 50% decrease in
serum M protein and 50% reduction in the urine M protein if both were measurable. If the patient had light chain
only, a 90% decrease in the 24-hour excretion of light
chain was required. Objective response required a 50%
decrease in the product of the cross diameters of any soft
tissue plasmacytoma. There must be no progression of skeletal lytic lesions or persistence of hypercalcemia. Complete
response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of M
protein from the serum defined by immunofixation and
complete disappearance of M protein from the urine by
immunofixation. The bone marrow aspirate/biopsy must
contain 3% plasma cells. There must be no evidence of
progressive disease by other parameters. A near-complete
response (NCR) was defined as negative immunofixation
of serum and urine but with lack of a repeat bone marrow,
or 3% to 6% bone marrow plasma cells remaining, or evidence of myeloma in the biopsy. Patients meeting objective
response criteria but not CR or NCR were considered to
have a partial response.
Disease progression was defined as an increase in serum M protein of 50% greater than the lowest response

Statistical Methods
The 2-sided Fisher exact test16 was used to test whether
there were significant differences between treatment arms
and patient characteristics. The 2-sided Wilcoxon test17
was used to test whether there were significant differences
between treatment arms in continuous patient characteristics. It was further used to compare the number of treatment cycles received between treatment arms. The 2sided Fisher exact test was also used to compare response
and toxicity rates between treatment arms. Survival
distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method.18 Survival comparisons were performed using
the 1-sided log-rank test19 for the primary overall survival
(OS) analysis between treatment arms and the 2-sided
log-rank test for all other OS analyses and all progressionfree survival (PFS) analyses. Cox proportional hazards
models were used to assess potential interaction.20 Nominal P values were adjusted based on actual information
time observed. For all other comparisons, a P value of .05
or less was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
A total of 268 patients were entered in the study; 236
patients entered Step 2 (randomization to VBMCP vs
VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN). The patient characteristics of
those eligible at randomization are shown in Table 1. The
median age was 64 years.
The treatment groups were well balanced for the
stratification factors, except that a higher frequency of
pain and radiographic bone abnormalities were found in
Cancer

May 15, 2009

The median number of cycles of treatment was 9 for the
VBMCP arm and 11 for VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN (P <
.001). The proportion of patients who completed the
assigned treatment was the same in both regimens (57%).
The most common reason for discontinuation of therapy
was progressive disease (17% in VBMCP and 13% in
VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN). The other causes for discontinuation did not differ statistically between the 2 treatment
arms. Death without progressive disease occurred in 3
patients receiving VBMCP compared with 5 patients on
the VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN regimen.
Response to Therapy
The overall response by treatment is shown in Table 2.
The overall objective response was 62% in the VBMCP
regimen and 68% in the VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN arm.
There was no significant difference between the treatment
arms in objective response rates (P ¼ .402). CRs were
found in 3.6% and 8.9%, respectively, whereas NCRs
occurred in 4.5% and 0.0%, respectively. Thus, the
CR þ NCR rates were 8.1% and 8.9%, respectively. The
NCR patients were probably included with the CR
patients in previous studies.
Progression-free Survival
A total of 218 patients were included in the analysis of
PFS. Five patients were excluded because they were unevaluable for response or progression or had insufficient follow-up data. Patients were counted as having had an event
if they progressed or died without documented

For patients who died, either without documented progression or within 3 months of their last disease evaluation, the PFS time was calculated as the time from

who died both without documented progression and >3

There were no statistically significant differences in PFS
when analyzed by sex or by race (Table 3, Fig. 2).

chemotherapeutic effect. The underlying hypothesis was
that a more intense induction would lead to a higher quality and more durable response, and better overall survival.
Thus a regimen using a more intensive induction with
VBMCP plus HiCy and alpha-2-IFN was compared with
VBMCP in this phase 3 trial.
At the time the study was designed, VBMCP
appeared to be a promising alternative to MP and was
therefore chosen as the control arm. The study was
designed before the arrival of new agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib. Thus, the experimental arm used agents thought to possess additive
antimyeloma activity, such as interferon and HiCy.6,22
Our study shows no significant difference in the overall
response rate between the 2 arms; overall response was
noted in 62% of patients in the VBMCP regimen versus
68% in the VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN regimen, although
the latter arm had a trend toward higher CR rates. PFS
was also not significantly different between the 2 arms:
2162

22.1 months in the VBMCP arm versus 25.3 months in
the VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN regimen (P ¼ .135). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the median OS
between the 2 arms: 37.1 months for VBMCP versus 41
months for those treated with VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN
(P ¼ .38). We found that grade 3 or higher infections
were more common in the VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN regimen (25.5% vs 8.8%), although deaths because of infection were not different in the 2 regimens. The incidence
of myelodysplastic syndrome was low in this trial (2.6%).
Since this trial was designed and accrued, interest in
using VBMCP and other similar combination chemotherapy regimens in newly diagnosed patients has markedly
decreased as a result of a series of trials that failed to show
survival advantage compared with MP. In 1 randomized
study of 479 previously untreated patients with multiple
myeloma, the response rate for VBMCP was 72% versus
51% for MP. Response duration was also longer with
VBMCP (median, 24 months) compared with MP

(median, 18 months). However, OS for VBMCP (median,
30 months) was not statistically different from that for MP
(median, 28 months) (P ¼ .30).2 A meta-analysis of
randomized trials confirmed a lack of survival benefit with
combination chemotherapy, despite improved response
rates.11 Similarly, despite some studies showing modest efficacy with interferon as induction6 or maintenance,23
more recent studies24 and meta-analysis have highlighted
the limited value of interferon as antimyeloma therapy.
This study shows no benefit with the addition of
HiCy and interferon to the treatment regimen. In addition, there was no significant difference in OS between
the 2 arms in either high-risk or low-risk patients based on
beta-2 microglobulin values or the ISS. Although this may
reflect the low therapeutic value of these agents in myeloma in the context of then-available alkylator-based
therapy, it may reflect that early administration of all
available active agents in myeloma may not always be of
clinical value in the absence of good preclinical data. Such
a strategy also carries the risk of fewer options at the time
of relapse. One of the lessons learned from this trial is that
in the future, given the number of new active agents for
myeloma, clinical trials investigating multidrug combinations to improve response and outcome should be based
on strong preclinical data and a clear hypothesis that can
be tested during the conduct of the trial. In this trial, the
CR rate in both arms was low, and based upon what we
know now it partly explains why the experimental arm
did not result in a significant improvement in outcome.
The present trial does have important limitations.
Since the trial was designed, MPT (melphalan, predniCancer

sone, and thalidomide)25,26 and VMP (vincristine,
melphalan, and prednisone)27 have demonstrated an OS
advantage over MP. Moreover, VBMCP is no longer recommended as initial therapy for most patients. This highlights the problems facing large cooperative group phase 3
trials in an era in which treatment advances are occurring
rapidly. Endpoints such as PFS and OS require many
years of follow-up, and thus results of randomized trials
run the risk of losing relevance by the time results are
published.
We conclude that VBMCP þ HiCy þ IFN was not
significantly more effective than VBMCP alone. Neither
regimen can now be recommended as initial therapy
because of the arrival of novel agents including thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide. These regimens are
active and may have an important role in relapsed multiple myeloma.
