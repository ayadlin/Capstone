In the above article, which shows that transcriptional repression of Nestin by p53 restricts
cellular plasticity and tumorigenesis in liver cancer, there is a duplicated micrograph panel in
Figure 7E. This figure shows the characterization of cholangiocarcinomas arising after
delivery of two vector constructs in murine livers (GFP-YAP;shp53 and mCherry-NICD).
Panel E documents the expression of GFP (indicating YAP;shp53) and mCherry (indicating
NICD), as well as positivity of HNF1b and Nestin staining. Owing to a labeling error, two
different photographs of the GFP slide were inadvertently used in the panel, with one
incorrectly being labeled as mCherry. A revised version of Figure 7E with the correct
micrograph showing mCherry expression is now provided below and supports the original
conclusions that expression of GFP and mCherry in the tissue mostly overlaps. We
apologize for any confusion that this error may have caused.
