Summary
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

An increasing number of therapeutic antibodies targeting tumors that express the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) are in clinical use or late stages of clinical development. Here we investigate
the molecular basis for inhibition of EGFR activation by the therapeutic antibody, matuzumab
(EMD72000). We describe the X-ray crystal structure of the Fab fragment of matuzumab (Fab72000)
in complex with isolated domain III from the extracellular region of EGFR. Fab72000 interacts with
an epitope on EGFR that is distinct from the ligand binding region on domain III and from the
cetuximab/Erbitux® epitope. Matuzumab blocks ligand induced receptor activation indirectly by
sterically preventing the domain rearrangement and local conformational changes that must occur
for high affinity ligand binding and receptor dimerization.
Significance—Antibodies targeting the EGF receptor family are proven anticancer drugs. The antiErbB2 antibody trastuzumab/Herceptin® is established as a treatment of ErbB2-positive breast
cancer, and therapeutic protocols are in clinical use for two EGFR-targeting antibodies, cetuximab/
Erbitux® and panitumumab/Vectibix®. Matuzumab, a humanized form of the mouse anti-EGFR
mAb425, is in phase II clinical trials. Our studies show that both the epitope for and the mechanism
of inhibition by matuzumab are distinct from those for cetuximab. We show that matuzumab and
cetuximab can both simultaneously bind to EGFR, implying that combination therapy with both
antibodies could be advantageous. This has important implications for the clinical use of matuzumab
and for the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting the EGF receptor.

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is aberrantly activated in a variety of epithelial
tumors and has been the focus of much interest as a target in anti-cancer therapy. EGFR is one
of a family of four receptor tyrosine kinases (collectively known as the ErbB or HER receptors)
that is involved in critical cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
(Hubbard and Miller, 2007; Schlessinger, 2000). Misregulation of EGFR, through

overexpression or mutation, leads to constitutive activity or impaired receptor downregulation
and can cause malignant transformation of the cell (Mendelsohn and Baselga, 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Based on structural studies over the past five years of the ErbB receptors, a model has been
proposed for ligand dependent dimerization and activation of EGFR (Figure 1) (Burgess et al.,
2003;Ferguson et al., 2003;Zhang et al., 2006). Dimerization of the EGFR extracellular region
is entirely receptor mediated with the majority of interactions contributed by domain II of
EGFR (Garrett et al., 2002;Ogiso et al., 2002). In the unliganded state the receptor adopts a
very different conformation that occludes much of the domain II dimerization interface in an
intramolecular interaction or tether with domain IV (Cho et al., 2002;Ferguson et al., 2003).
Upon ligand binding the extracellular region of EGFR must undergo a dramatic domain
rearrangement, which exposes the domain II dimerization interface. Additional localized
ligand induced changes stabilize the precise conformation of domain II that is required for
dimerization (Dawson et al., 2005). Receptor dimerization brings the intracellular regions into
close proximity promoting the allosteric activation of the kinase domains (Zhang et al.,
2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

This mechanism suggests a number of ways to inhibit EGFR activation through interaction
with the extracellular region of the receptor (Ferguson, 2004). X-ray crystallographic and
biochemical analysis of receptor-antibody complexes have indicated several modes of binding
that lead to effective inhibition of ErbB receptor signaling. The chimeric antibody cetuximab/
Erbitux® (Imclone/BMS and Merck KGaA) binds to domain III of EGFR, directly blocking
ligand binding (Li et al., 2005). Another anti-EGFR antibody, mAb806, binds to domain II
close to the receptor dimerization site (Johns et al., 2004). The anti-ErbB2 antibody
pertuzumab/Omnitarg® (Genentech) binds to the domain II dimerization arm and prevents
ligand induced ErbB2 heterodimerization (Franklin et al., 2004), while trastuzumab/
Herceptin® (Genentech) binds to the membrane proximal domain IV of ErbB2 (Cho et al.,
2003) and likely modulates a cleavage event that leads to ectodomain shedding and kinase
activation (Molina et al., 2001).
We were interested to establish the mode of inhibition of EGFR by another therapeutic
antibody, matuzumab (EMD72000), which targets EGFR expressing tumors. Matuzumab is
the humanized form of the murine mAb 425 (EMD55900) that was produced by immunization
of BALB/c mice with human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells (Kettleborough et al., 1991;
Murthy et al., 1987). Matuzumab has performed well in phase I clinical trials against a number
of cancers, both alone and in combination with chemotherapy (Bier et al., 2001; Graeven et
al., 2006; Kollmannsberger et al., 2006; Vanhoefer et al., 2004), and is being actively pursued
in multiple ongoing phase II trials (Seiden et al., 2007; Socinski, 2007).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here we describe the crystal structure of the Fab fragment of matuzumab (Fab72000) bound
to a truncated form of the extracellular region of EGFR that comprises all of domain III plus
the first 24 amino acids from domain IV. Matuzumab binds to an epitope on domain III of
EGFR that is distinct from both the ligand binding site and the cetuximab epitope on that
domain. Matuzumab does not directly block the access of ligand to the domain III binding site,
and thus does not share the primary mechanism for inhibition of ligand induced EGFR
activation employed by cetuximab. Rather, the binding of matuzumab to domain III sterically
blocks the domain rearrangement that is required for high affinity ligand binding and receptor
dimerization. Further binding to this epitope places the antigen binding domains of matuzumab
such as to impede the formation of the critical contacts between domains II and III that are
required to stabilize the dimerization competent conformation of domain II. This previously
undescribed, non-competitive mechanism of inhibition of EGFR activation has implications
for both the application of current drugs and the development of new anti-EGFR therapeutics.

Results and Discussion
Binding characteristics of matuzumab to cell surface and soluble EGFR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine the mode of binding of matuzumab to EGFR, and to elucidate the mechanism of
inhibition of EGFR by this therapeutic antibody, we sought to determine the X-ray crystal
structure of the complex between the Fab fragment of the antibody and the extracellular region
of EGFR. We first characterized the binding of matuzumab to the soluble extracellular domain
of EGFR (sEGFR) and compared the results to the behavior of this antibody in cell surface
binding assays.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Soluble EGFR was produced by secretion from baculovirus infected Sf9 cells and purified
exactly as described (Ferguson et al., 2000). The Fab fragment of matuzumab (Fab72000),
produced by papain cleavage of the antibody, was immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip (see
Experimental Procedures). Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR/Biacore), we established
that sEGFR binds to this immobilized Fab72000 with a KD value of 113 ± 25 nM (Figure 2A).
This value is weaker than observed for the binding of 125I-labeled intact matuzumab to cell
surface EGFR (about 1–10 nM, depending on the cell line employed, data not shown), although
these binding assays are not directly comparable. It has previously been shown that the epitope
for cetuximab lies exclusively on domain III of sEGFR (Li et al., 2005). To address whether
this is also true for matuzumab we produced and purified isolated domain III of sEGFR
(sEGFRd3; amino acids 311-514 of mature EGFR) exactly as described (Li et al., 2005). As
shown in Figure 2A, sEGFRd3 binds to immobilized Fab72000 with a KD value of 43.0 ± 12.9
nM. The antigen binding domain of matuzumab, like that of cetuximab, binds more tightly to
sEGFRd3, possibly due to the absence of steric hindrance from the other domains of sEGFR.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next used both SPR and cell surface binding analysis to investigate the ability of matuzumab
to compete with ligand binding to EGFR. As shown in Figure 2B matuzumab, like cetuximab,
competes efficiently for the binding of 3 nM 125I-labeled EGF to the surface of A431
epidermoid carcinoma cells. It has previously been shown that, in the context of an SPR/
Biacore assay, the Fab fragment of cetuximab (FabC225) is able to block all binding of soluble
sEGFR to immobilize EGF (Li et al., 2005). We asked if this is also true for the Fab fragment
of matuzumab. Samples of 600 nM sEGFR containing increasing excesses of Fab72000 were
passed over a biosensor surface to which EGF had been immobilized. As shown in Figure 2C,
there is an initial decrease in the equilibrium SPR response as increasing Fab72000 is added.
At a 1:1 molar ratio of Fab72000:sEGFR the SPR response is about 45 % of that obtained with
no added Fab. Addition of increasing excesses of Fab72000 does not further reduce this binding
level. Even at higher concentration of sEGFR and with up to a 50 fold excess of Fab72000 (not
shown) the equilibrium SPR response does not fall below 40 % of the value in the absence of
added Fab. One possible explanation for the observed SPR responses in Figure 2C is that both
unbound sEGFR and the Fab72000/sEGFR complex can interact with the immobilized EGF,
but that the complex binds with substantially weaker affinity. Equilibrium binding analysis to
immobilized EGF for samples of sEGFR containing a 10 fold molar excess of Fab72000
indicates an apparent KD value that is approximately five fold weaker than for sEGFR alone
(data not shown). Certainly these data suggest that there must be something quite different
about the mode of binding to sEGFR of the Fab fragment of matuzumab compared to that of
cetuximab. Both antibodies are able to compete for binding of low concentrations of EGF to
cell surface EGFR, yet the Fab fragments from the two antibodies have very different effects
on the ability of soluble EGFR to bind to immobilized EGF in the Biacore assay (Figure 2D
and Li et al., 2005).
To gain further insight into the precise mode of binding of matuzumab to EGFR, and to
understand how this leads to inhibition of cell surface ligand binding and of ligand stimulated

EGFR activation, we crystallized and solved the structures of Fab72000 alone and in complex
with the sEGFRd3 (see Experimental Procedures and Table 1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The structure of the Fab72000/sEGFRd3 complex
Crystals of the isolated Fab72000 that diffract to 2.15 Å resolution were obtained, and the
structure was solved by molecular replacement (MR) methods using as search model the
coordinates of an Fab fragment selected by degree of sequence similarity (PDB id 1L7I). A
complex of sEGFRd3 and Fab72000 was purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC),
and crystals that diffract to 3.2 Å resolution obtained using streak seeding techniques. To solve
this structure MR search models based on the coordinates for domain III of sEGFR (PDB id
1YY9) and the coordinates of the refined Fab72000 were used to locate the two Fab72000/
sEGFRd3 complexes in the asymmetric unit. Data collection and refinement statistics are given
in Table 1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Fab72000 binds primarily to the loop that precedes the most C-terminal strand of the domain
III β-helix (amino acids 454-464; highlighted in red in Figure 3A). This loop penetrates into a
cleft between the VL and VH domains of the Fab. The tip of this loop forms a type I beta turn,
with T459 and S460 in this turn protruding the farthest into the cleft. This mode of binding is
unusual for the recognition of a large protein antigen where it is more common for the epitope
to comprise of a large flat surface on the antigen (Sundberg and Mariuzza, 2002), as was
observed for the binding of cetuximab to EGFR (Li et al., 2005). All of the key interactions
made by the Fab are from the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), with the major
specificity determining contacts coming from CDRs H3 and L3. All of the CDRs contribute
to binding to domain III, also an unusual feature compared to most antigen-antibody complexes
(Sundberg and Mariuzza, 2002).
The tip of the buried loop from sEGFR makes interactions with both the heavy and light chain
CDRs (Figure 3B); the side chain of T459 interacts with that of H93 from the Fab light chain,
while the side chain of S460 contacts the CDR H2 side chain E50. Two lysines, one on either
end of the sEGFRd3 epitope loop, form salt bridge interactions with aspartic acids on the Fab
(K454 with D100 from CDR H3 and K463 with CDR L2 D49). Additional interactions with
the buried epitope loop are contributed by side chains in CDRs H1, H2 and L1 that are within
hydrogen bonding distance of the main chain of sEGFRd3 (Figures 3B and S1). Two important
direct interactions are made between the Fab and regions of domain III outside the loop between
amino acids 454-464. A histidine from CDR L3 (H93) interacts with D434 on the adjacent
loop of the sEGFRd3 β-helix, while on the other side of the binding site Y103 from the apex
of CDR H3 extends to interact with N449. These two interactions anchor the Fab over the
central binding loop and expand the epitope substantially beyond the single peptide loop.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A total of 2 salt bridges and 11 predicted hydrogen bonds are involved in the interaction
between Fab72000 and sEGFRd3, in an interface that buries 758 Å2 of solvent accessible
surface on domain III (a total of 1516 Å2 of surface is occluded from solvent in the complex).
The shape complementarity (sc) parameter for the interface of the Fab72000/sEGFRd3
complex is 0.62, slightly lower than is typically observed for antigen-antibody interfaces (0.64
to 0.68) (Lawrence and Colman, 1993). The sc values reported for cetuximab bound to EGFR
(Li et al. 2005) and for the pertuzumab and trastuzumab complexes with the extracellular region
ErbB2 (Cho et al., 2003; Franklin et al., 2004) are all somewhat higher, in the range from 0.70
to 0.75, perhaps reflecting the more convex shape of the matuzumab epitope compared to those
of these other antibody drugs.
Neither the conformation of sEGFRd3 nor of Fab72000 is significantly altered upon formation
of the complex. There are very minor differences in the side chain positions in both the domain
III epitope and in the CDRs of the Fab. Most notably Y103 in the VH domain is disordered in

the unbound Fab and becomes ordered on interacting with sEGFR. The elbow angle changes
by only 4° between the bound and unbound Fab72000, which is in within the range expected
due to dynamic elbow flexibility (Stanfield et al., 2006).
Not only is the conformation of domain III unaltered by Fab72000 binding but the location of
the bound Fab72000 would not be expected to disrupt the tethered configuration of sEGFR
(Figure 1, left hand panel), the preferred solution conformation of the receptor (Dawson et al.,
2007) and the likely conformation of the unliganded receptor at the cell surface. Fab72000 can
readily be docked onto its epitope on either of the two, known structures of tethered sEGFR
(PDB ids 1NQL and 1YY9) without hindrance from any of the other domains of sEGFR.
The matuzumab epitope is distinct from the ligand binding site on domain III of sEGFR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To confirm that the crystallographically defined epitope for matuzumab precisely represents
what is seen in solution, we generated site specific alterations in sEGFR at key amino acids in
the domain III matuzumab epitope (Figure 3B & 4A). Each alteration was introduced in the
context of the full length extracellular domain and these altered sEGFR proteins expressed and
purified using appropriately baculovirus infected Sf9 cells. Each purified, altered sEGFR was
analyzed for binding to immobilized Fab72000 and to immobilized EGF, exactly as described
(Li et al., 2005). Alteration to alanine of either of the two lysines on the epitope loop (K454A
or K463A) leads to an approximate 100-fold reduction in the affinity of sEGFR for Fab72000
(Figure 4B). Substitution of alanines at T459 and S460 (T459A/T460A) also dramatically
reduces the binding affinity. The combination of either lysine to alanine substitution with
T459A/T460A abolishes all detectable interaction between sEGFR and the immobilized
Fab72000.
As shown in Figure 4A the binding sites for matuzumab and for EGF on domain III do not
overlap. As would be predicted based upon this observation, the sEGFR proteins with
alterations in the Fab72000 epitope bind to immobilized EGF with near wild type affinity
(Figure 4B). This also confirms that the striking reduction in binding affinity of these altered
sEGFR proteins for Fab72000 is not due to a global disruption of the structure of domain III
of sEGFR. Finally, substitution of two amino acids that are known to be critical for EGF binding
(D355T/F357A) have negligible effect on binding of sEGFR to Fab72000.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Not only is there no overlap of the epitope for matuzumab and the ligand binding region on
domain III, but a bound Fab72000 would impose no steric hindrance to the binding of EGF or
of TGFα to domain III. With domain III from the Fab72000/sEGFRd3 complex overlaid on
domain III from the sEGFR/EGF complex (PDB id 1IVO) the closest approach of the Fab and
EGF is 9 Å. This is in stark contrast to the situation for cetuximab binding. There is a high
degree of overlap between the cetuximab and EGF binding sites on domain III (Figure 4C).
The steric block of this ligand binding site is the primary mechanism of cetuximab mediated
inhibition of ligand induced dimerization and activation of EGFR (Li et al., 2005). Clearly the
mechanism of inhibition of EGFR activation by matuzumab must be different.
Implications for the mechanism of inhibition of EGFR activation by matuzumab
If matuzumab does not directly block access of the ligand to the domain III ligand binding site,
how does it prevent high affinity ligand binding, receptor dimerization and activation? To
understand this we consider the effect of the binding of Fab72000 upon the formation of the
ligand induced dimeric form of the receptor. As shown in Figure 1, sEGFR undergoes a
dramatic domain rearrangement in going from the tethered inactive state to the ligand bound
dimeric state (Burgess et al., 2003). Additional local structural changes in domain II are known
to be key for high affinity ligand binding, receptor dimerization and activation (Dawson et al.,
2005;Ogiso et al., 2002). As shown in Figure 5, and discussed in detail below, when domain

III from the Fab72000/sEGFRd3 complex is overlaid on domain III from the receptor in its
extended, dimerization competent conformation (PDB id 1MOX), there are direct clashes
between the bound Fab72000 and both domains I and II of the extended receptor. With
matuzumab bound to domain III of EGFR, the receptor cannot undergo the large scale domain
rearrangement that is required for dimerization. Further the binding of Fab72000 blocks the
critical local conformational changes in domain II.
With the receptor in the extended conformation, the N-terminal region of the domain I clashes
with the light chain of Fab72000 preventing domain I from reaching the position that is required
for high affinity ligand binding (indicated with an arrow in Figure 5A). This is reminiscent in
nature and extent to clashes between the antigen binding fragment of cetuximab (FabC225)
and domain I that were previously implicated as part of the mechanism of inhibition of EGFR
dimerization by that antibody (Li et al., 2005). In that case the different orientation of FabC225
on domain III positions the VH domain such as to occlude the N-terminal portion of domain I
from its required position in the receptor dimer.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Clashes between domain II of the extended receptor and the Fab were not seen in the cetuximab
complex, and are significant. With Fab72000 bound to domain III of EGFR it would not be
possible for the C-terminal portion of domain II to adopt the conformation observed in the
ligand bound dimeric form of the receptor. As shown in Figure 5B, if Fab72000 is docked onto
its epitope on domain III of an sEGFR molecule in the extended conformation, there are clashes
along the C-terminal half of domain II, predominantly with the VL domain of the Fab. This Cterminal half of domain II forms the binding pocket for the dimerization arm from the other
molecule in the receptor dimer. Additional interactions across the dimer interface from a Cterminal loop on domain II (D279 and H280, marked with a star in Figure 5A) contribute
substantially to the stability of the EGFR dimer. The conformation of domain II in this region
is stabilized by interactions with domain III that have been demonstrated to be critical for EGFR
dimerization and activation (Dawson et al., 2005; Ogiso et al. 2002). The binding of Fab72000
to domain III would disrupt all of these interactions. Thus, Fab72000 binding to domain III of
EGFR blocks the global domain rearrangement of EGFR and the local conformational changes
in domain II. We propose that blocking both of these key elements in formation of the
productive EGFR dimer is critical for the effective inhibition of EGFR activation by
matuzumab.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The steric restriction on EGFR conformation imposed by the binding of matuzumab offers a
structural framework to explain the competition data presented in Figure 2. When matuzumab
(or just its antigen binding domain, Fab72000) binds to the extracellular region of EGFR, the
receptor cannot adopt the conformation required for both domains I and III to engage in ligand
binding. However the ligand binding site on domain III is completely exposed. EGF can bind
to this site with low affinity (approximately 1 μM; Kohda et al., 1993;Lemmon et al., 1997;Li
et al. 2005). Under the conditions of the cell based assay, weak binding of EGF to only domain
III of EGFR is not detected. By preventing the receptor from adopting the conformation
required for the bipartite binding of EGF between domains I and III, matuzumab blocks all
detectable binding of EGF to cell surface EGFR in this assay. By contrast the Biacore assay is
performed at a much higher concentration of soluble ligand (in this case 600 nM sEGFR, which
binds to immobilized EGF). Under these conditions the monovalent binding of domain III
alone to EGF can be detected. In the Biacore assay, the residual binding to immobilized EGF
observed for sEGFR in the presence of excess Fab72000 is due, at least in part, to binding to
EGF of the exposed domain III in an Fab72000/sEGFR complex.
Implications for the therapeutic application of matuzumab
As discussed above the mechanism of inhibition of matuzumab is different from that previously
described for cetuximab. Both antibodies effectively block productive binding of EGF to cell

surface EGFR (Figure 2B) but do so by interacting with distinct epitopes on domain III. Not
only are the epitopes non-overlapping, but the structures suggest that both antibodies could
simultaneously bind to EGFR. As shown in Figure 6A, when FabC225 and Fab72000 are
simultaneously docked onto their respective epitopes on domain III the two Fab fragments
occupy different positions and do not clash. This observation is consistent with cellular
competition assays. Excess cetuximab is unable to compete with the binding of 125I-labeled
matuzumab to the cell surface EGFR on A431 cells (Figure 6B). Similarly matuzumab cannot
compete for 125I-labeled cetuximab binding (Figure 6C). Further it has been reported that there
are an increased number of cell surface antibody binding sites for a mixture of matuzumab and
cetuximab compared to either antibody alone (Kreysch & Schmidt, 2004). This suggests that
both matuzumab and cetuximab can bind to a single receptor molecule at the cell surface.
Treatment of cells with combinations of antibodies against distinct epitopes on the extracellular
domain of EGFR, and on the related family member ErbB2, lead to enhanced receptor
internalization and degradation (Friedman et al., 2005), a factor that contributes to the antitumor
activity of many therapeutic antibodies. Matuzumab and cetuximab can both bind
simultaneously to EGFR and this has the potential to lead to synergistic antitumor effects.
Combination of matuzumab and cetuximab could, thus, be beneficial in cancer therapy.
Conclusion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

EGFR dimerization requires a conformational reorganization of the receptor extracellular
region that is promoted by ligand binding to domains I and III (Figure 1 & 7). As shown
schematically in Figure 7, cetuximab acts as a competitive inhibitor, preventing ligand induced
dimerization by directly blocking access of ligand to the domain III ligand binding site. By
contrast matuzumab does not occlude the ligand binding site on domain III. Rather matuzumab
exploits a non-competitive mechanism to inhibit sEGFR dimerization and activation. Inhibition
of ligand induced EGFR activation by matuzumab is entirely dependent on sterically blocking
the receptor from adopting the conformation that is required for high affinity ligand binding
and dimerization. These different mechanisms of inhibition suggest opportunities to exploit
multiple EGFR targeting drugs to act synergistically for optimal therapeutic gain.

Experimental Procedures
Protein expression and purification

sEGFR and sEGFRd3 were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, purified as described
(Ferguson et al., 2000; Li et al., 2005) and used without modification of their glycosylation
state. Matuzumab (EMD72000) was provided by Merck KGaA. The Fab fragment of
matuzumab (Fab72000) was generated by papain cleavage using the ImmunoPure Fab
Preparation Kit (Pierce), and used without additional purification. Fab72000/sEGFR complex
was generated exactly as described (Li et al., 2005). To generate the complex with sEGFRd3,
Fab was mixed with a 1.2 fold molar excess of sEGFRd3 and excess sEGFRd3 separated from
Fab72000/sEGFRd3 complex by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Bio-Silect
SEC250 column (Bio-Rad), equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5.
Crystallization and data collection
Proteins were concentrated and buffer exchanged into 10 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5
and crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Large single crystals of
Fab72000 were obtained by mixing equal volumes (1 μl) of the Fab (13 mg/ml) with a solution
containing 1.8 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5 and equilibrating over a reservoir of
this buffer at 20°C. Crystals were flash frozen in reservoir solution that was supplemented with
9% sucrose, 2% glucose, 8% glycerol, 8% ethylene glycol. X-ray diffraction data were
collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) beamline F1, using an

(Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1.
Structure determination and refinement

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The structures of the Fab72000 and Fab72000/sEGFRd3 were solved by the method of
molecular replacement (MR) using the program PHASER (CCP4, 1994). To solve the Fab
structure the coordinates for Fab2C4 (PDB id 1L7I) (Vajdos et al., 2002) were selected as the
initial search model based on the sequence identity between Fab2C4 and Fab72000. To solve
the Fab72000/sEGFRd3 structure one of the two Fab fragments in the asymmetric unit was
first located using the refined Fab72000 coordinates as search model. With the position of this
Fab fragment fixed, a second search using the coordinates of domain III of sEGFR (amino
acids 310-500 from PDB id 1YY9) located one of the sEGFRd3 molecules. Subsequently the
second Fab72000/sEGFRd3 complex in the asymmetric unit was found. Coordinates were
manually rebuilt in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and refined using CNS (Brünger et al.,
1998) and Refmac (CCP4, 1994). New maps were calculated following each iteration of
refinement, including solvent flattened maps with minimized model bias calculated using the
program DM (CCP4, 1994). Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.
SPR/Biacore binding studies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)/Biacore studies were carried out using a BIAcore 3000
instrument at 25°C in 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Tween-20, pH 8.0.
Fab72000 was immobilized on a Biacore CM5 biosensor chip as follows: the CM-dextran
matrix was activated with N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride
(EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Fab72000 (500 ng) was flowed over this activated
surface at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 at 5 μl per minute for
20 minutes. The remaining reactive sites were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5).
Immobilized Fab fragment contributed a signal of 1436 response units (RU). The surface was
regenerated between sEGFR injections with two 5 μl injections 10 mM glycine, 1 M NaCl, pH
2.5 to remove remaining bound sEGFR. EGF immobilization and sEGFR binding analysis
were performed exactly as described (Ferguson et al., 2000). Data were analyzed using Prism
4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Cell based binding studies
125I-labeled

EGF, matuzumab and cetuximab were generated with specific activities of 1750
Ci/mmol, 273 Ci/mmol and 238 Ci/mmol respectively. A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells were
plated in 96-well dishes and grown to 75–90 % confluence. Cells were washed twice with ice
cold DMEM containing 1% BSA (incubation medium) and incubated in this medium
containing 3 nM radio-labeled ligand plus the relevant cold competitor (200 μl/well) for 6 hours
at 4°C. Cells were washed 3 times with ice cold incubation medium and were lysed with 1 M
NaOH (200 μl/well). The wells were washed with 200 μl of water and liquid scintillation
counting used to determine the counts of bound 125I-labeled species. Data were analyzed using
Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).

Generation of sEGFR epitope mutations

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Standard PCR-directed site-directed mutagenesis strategies were used to produce the
appropriate DNA in the pFastBac vector. The following mutations were made: K454A, K463A,
T459A/S460A, K454A/T459A/S460A, T459A/S460A/K463A. The generation of
recombinant baculovirus, overexpression in Sf9 cells and protein purification were exactly as
described before for wild-type sEGFR (Ferguson et al., 2000).
Coordinates of the Fab72000 and Fab72000/sEGFRd3 structures have been deposited, with
PDB id codes 3C08 and 3C09 respectively.

FIGURE 1. Ligand induced EGF receptor dimerization

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The extracellular region of the EGF receptor (sEGFR) is shown in cartoon representation with
domain I in red, domain II in green and domains III and IV in gray with the secondary structure
elements highlighted in red and green respectively. The inactive receptor (left hand view) exists
in a tethered, autoinhibited conformation with an intramolecular interaction between the
domains II and IV. Upon ligand binding the receptor adopts a very different domain
arrangement (right hand view). Ligand (here EGF, shown in purple cartoon) binds between
domains I and III of a single EGFR molecule, stabilizing the precise, extended configuration
of EGFR that can dimerize. All contacts between the two molecules in the dimer are receptor
mediated with domain II providing the primary dimerization contacts. EGF receptor
dimerization is ligand induced, but entirely receptor mediated. The colors on the right hand
molecule in the sEGFR dimer have been muted for contrast. Coordinates from PDB ids 1IVO
and 1NQL were used to generate this figure. Domain IV in the sEGFR dimer was modeled as
previously described (Ferguson et al., 2003).

matuzumab

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis of the binding of sEGFR and sEGFRd3 to
immobilized Fab72000 (the antigen binding domain of matuzumab). A series of samples of
sEGFR or sEGFRd3, at the indicated concentrations, was passed over a biosensor surface to
which Fab72000 had been amine coupled. Data points show the equilibrium SPR response
value for a representative set of samples of sEGFR (black squares) and of sEGFRd3 (open
triangles), expressed as a percentage of the maximal SPR binding response. The curves
represent the fit of these data to a simple one-site Langmuir binding equation. KD values, based
on at least three independent binding experiments, are 113 ± 25 nM for sEGFR and 43 ± 13
nM for sEGFRd3.
B. Competition of EGF (green diamonds), matuzumab (red triangles) or cetuximab (black
triangles) for the binding of 125I-labeled EGF to A431 cells. Cells were incubated with media
containing 3 nM 125I-labeled EGF plus the indicated concentration of cold matuzumab,
cetuximab or EGF for 6 hours at 4°C. Following washing to remove unbound material, cells
were lysed and liquid scintillation counting used to determine the amount of bound 125I-labeled
EGF. The counts per minute (CPM) for each sample is show, expressed as a percentage of the
CPM value obtained for no added competitor. Error bars indicated that standard deviation on
three independent experiments. The line indicates the fit to a sigmoidal dose-response model.
IC50 values from this analysis are 2.0 nM for matuzumab and cetuximab and 7.3 nM for EGF.

amine coupled. The equilibrium SPR responses for each mixture is shown, normalized to the
response obtained with no added Fab. Error bars indicate the standard deviation on at least
three independent measurements. The line simply connects the data points.
D. The ability of FabC225 (the antigen binding domain of cetuximab; gray shades) and
Fab72000 (red shades) to compete for the binding of 600 nM sEGFR to immobilized EGF,

in the sEGFR dimer shown in Figure 1 (with domains colored as for the left hand protomer;
EGF is omitted for clarity). The Fab72000 is colored as in Figure 3. The N-terminal region of
domain I clashes with the VL domain (indicated with an arrow). Additional clashes occur along
the C-terminal half of domain II (see part B). The C-terminal loop on domain II (D278, H280)
that makes critical contacts across the dimer interface is marked with a star.
B. In this view, an approximate 50° rotation about the vertical axis relative to part A, domain
II is shown in sphere representation in dark green. A cartoon of domain II of the other molecule
in the dimer is shown (light green) for reference. Domain I has been omitted for clarity. The
VL domain of the Fab clashes with domain II in the critical C-terminal region that forms the
binding pocket for the dimerization arm and makes important contacts with domain III (from
N274 and E293 in domain II, colored orange). These interactions are known to be crucial for
stabilizing the dimerization competent conformation of domain II. The Fab72000 epitope loop
on domain III is colored in red.

FIGURE 7. Matuzumab and cetuximab use different mechanisms to block ligand induced EGFR
dimerization and activation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the center of the scheme the ligand induced sEGFR dimer is represented, with domain I in
red, domain II in green, domain III in gray with red border, domain IV in gray with green border
and the ligand (E) in violet. The colors for one protomer are lightened for contrast. On the left
hand side a scheme is shown to illustrate the mechanism of inhibition of ligand induced
dimerization by matuzumab. Fab72000 binds to domain III of sEGFR and sterically prevents
the receptor from adopting the conformation required for dimerization. Importantly Fab72000
blocks the local conformational changes in domain II that are critical for both high affinity
ligand binding and dimerization. The inhibition is non-competitive; the ligand binding site on
domain III is not blocked. This contrasts with the mechanism of inhibition previously reported
for cetuximab (Li et al., 2005). FabC225 (right hand side) is a competitive inhibitor that blocks
the ligand binding site on domain III. This is the primary mechanism of inhibition of ligand
mediated dimerization by cetuximab.
