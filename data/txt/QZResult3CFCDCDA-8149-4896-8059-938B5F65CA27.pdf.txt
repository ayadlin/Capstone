Abstract
Neuroblastoma is uniquely sensitive to single-agent inhibition of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Chk1,
leading us to examine downstream effectors of this pathway and identify mitotic regulator Wee1 as an additional
therapeutic target in this disease. Wee1 was overexpressed in both neuroblastoma cell lines and high-risk patient
tumors. Genetic or pharmacologic abrogation of Wee1 signaling results in marked cytotoxicity in 10 of 11
neuroblastoma cell lines with a median IC50 of 300 nmol/L for the Wee1-selective small-molecule inhibitor MK1775. Murine tumor lines derived from mice that were either heterozygous or homozygous for MycN were
particularly sensitive to single-agent inhibition of Wee1 (IC50s of 160 and 62 nmol/L, respectively). Simultaneous
pharmacologic inhibition of Chk1 and Wee1 acted in a synergistic fashion to further impede neuroblastoma cell
growth in vitro, in a manner greater than the individual inhibitors either alone or combined with chemotherapy.
Combination Chk1 and Wee1 inhibition also revealed in vivo efﬁcacy in neuroblastoma xenografts. Taken
together, our results show that neuroblastoma cells depend on Wee1 activity for growth and that inhibition of this
kinase may serve as a therapeutic for patients with neuroblastoma. Cancer Res; 73(2); 776–84. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is a common pediatric tumor derived from
the cells of the sympathetic nervous system that manifests with
signiﬁcant clinical heterogeneity (1–3). Patients are typically
stratiﬁed into risk groups on the basis of several criteria at
diagnosis, including age, tumor ploidy, MYCN ampliﬁcation
status, and histologic features (1, 2). Although low-risk patients
are successfully treated with surgery, approximately 50% of all
children with neuroblastoma are diagnosed with high-risk
disease, requiring myeloablative chemotherapy followed by
maintenance with retinoids and anti-GD2–based immunotherapy (3). Despite this intense multimodal treatment regimen, half of these patients will eventually relapse and succumb
to the disease and those who survive are typically burdened
with treatment-related chronic illnesses (4). The intense chemotherapy schedule and poor survival rate characteristic of
high-risk and/or relapsed neuroblastoma underscores the
need for novel therapies to successfully treat children burdened with this disease. To this end, our group recently

identiﬁed the DNA damage response (DDR) protein checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), as a bona ﬁde molecular target through
an siRNA screen of the neuroblastoma kinome (5). Our ﬁndings
showed that neuroblastoma possesses disproportionate Chk1
activity, and compared with any other tumor histotype, is
uniquely sensitive to single-agent Chk1 inhibition, likely due
to MYC and MYCN oncogene–induced replicative stress.
Because of this reliance upon Chk1 signaling, we hypothesized
that neuroblastoma is particularly susceptible to DDR pathway
interference, leading us to investigate potentially tractable
pathway members.
The maintenance of genomic integrity through error-free
DNA replication and precisely timed cellular division is essential for the accurate transfer of genetic information to daughter
cells. Flawless cell-cycle progression is dependent upon the
tightly regulated coordination between several cell-cycle
checkpoint proteins and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
family of proteins. Malignant cells frequently exploit defects in
DNA repair and/or cell-cycle checkpoint pathways to stimulate
aberrant cellular division, thereby gaining a distinct survival
advantage (6). Key regulators of DNA damage surveillance
pathways, such as the checkpoint kinases ATR, Chk1, and
Wee1, recognize DNA aberrations and arrest cellular division
until genomic integrity is restored (7, 8). Paradoxically, however, the aberrant activity of DDR proteins can also serve to
dampen the replication stress generated by oncogenic transformation, thereby protecting cancer cells (9).
Both of the serine/threonine kinases Chk1 and Wee1 are
overexpressed and/or aberrantly activated in several cancer
types, suggesting that they may serve as attractive molecular
targets for pharmacologic intervention (7–13). Chk1 exerts
indirect checkpoint control through both S-phase and G2–M

Dual Inhibition of Chk1/Wee1 in Neuroblastoma

phases of the cell cycle and is phosphorylated by ATR in
response to DNA damage caused by oncogene-induced stress,
stalled replication forks, ultraviolet light, or genotoxic agents
(14, 15). Activation of Chk1 results in the sequestration and/or
subsequent degradation of the Cdc25A and Cdc25C phosphatases, consequently causing cell-cycle arrest through accumulation of inactive cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK; ref. 14). In a
parallel pathway, Wee1 signals in concert with Chk1 by directly
catalyzing an inhibitory phosphorylation at the Y15 residue of
Cdc2 (CDK1), abrogating its activity and inhibiting mitotic
progression at the G2 checkpoint (16). Because both Chk1 and
Wee1 signaling ultimately result in cell-cycle arrest, it seems
counterintuitive that constitutive activity of these kinases
would contribute to a malignant phenotype. However, many
cancer types harbor G1 checkpoint deﬁciencies, such as TP53
inactivation, necessitating reliance upon G2 checkpoint signaling for continued survival. In particular, cancers with G2
checkpoint hyperactivation may be more efﬁcient at repairing
the genetic lesions generated by genotoxic insults (17, 18).
Therefore, small-molecule inhibitors targeting the G2 checkpoint are intriguing as both single-agent and combination
therapies aimed at enhancing conventional chemotherapy
with the rationale that abrogation of Chk1/Wee1 signaling
forces mitotic progression with incompletely replicated or
damaged DNA, leading to mitotic catastrophe and subsequent
cell death (11, 18, 19).
Therefore, with the goal of identifying additional therapeutic
targets of the DNA damage pathway in neuroblastoma, we
focused our efforts on Wee1, for which there are inhibitors in
clinical trials (NCT00648648) and evidence of synthetic lethality with Chk1 (20). We found that Wee1 is highly expressed and
phosphorylated in neuroblastoma, with single-agent sensitivity reminiscent of what we previously observed for Chk1. In
addition, we provide evidence that combination therapy with
small-molecule inhibitors of Chk1 and Wee1 exhibits synergistic efﬁcacy in vitro and in vivo models of neuroblastoma.
Therefore, attenuation of Chk1 and Wee1 signaling may
be a rational therapeutic approach for the treatment of
neuroblastoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell culturing
All neuroblastoma cell lines were obtained from the CHOP
neuroblastoma cell line bank. They are routinely mycoplasma
and identity tested using AmpFLSTR Identiﬁler (Applied Biosystems), last done in October 2011. The non-neuroblastoma
lines were purchased directly from American Type Culture
Collection (where they do short tandem repeat testing) within
6 months of use in this study.
siRNA transfection
Transfections were conducted in triplicate as previously
described (21) using ON-TARGET SMARTpool siRNAs
(Thermo Scientiﬁc) speciﬁc for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Plk1, Wee1, and Chk1. Cell viability
was quantiﬁed at 72 hours by use of Cell Titer-Glo assay
(Promega). Gene knockdown was conﬁrmed to be more than
90% by quantitative real-time PCR.

www.aacrjournals.org

Immunohistochemistry
Following standard antigen retrieval protocol, phosphoWee1 antibody (Cell Signaling #4910) was used to stain formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded sections at a 1:1,000 dilution
for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were again rinsed and
then incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories BA-1000) at a 1:200 dilution for 30 minutes at room
temperature, followed by avidin–biotin complex (Vector Laboratories PK-6100) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Slides
were then rinsed and incubated with DAB (DAKO Cytomation
K3468). Counterstaining was conducted for 1 minute in Harris
Hematoxylin (Fisher Scientiﬁc 6765001). Slides were rinsed and
dehydrated through a series of ascending concentrations of
ethanol and xylene and then coverslipped. After drying, slides
were digitally scanned at 20 magniﬁcation on an Aperio OS
slide scanner (Aperio Technologies Inc.).
Pharmacological inhibition
MK-8776 (also known as SCH 900776) and MK-1775 were
provided by Merck & Co. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells
were treated in triplicate over a 4-log dose range (10–10,000
nmol/L) and a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control. Cells were
cultured for 72 hours, and cell viability was measured using Cell
Titer-Glo assays (Promega). IC50 determination was made
using a nonlinear log inhibitor versus normalized response
curve ﬁt function (GraphPad). Caspase activation assays and
the cleaved PARP Western blot analyses were conducted at 16
hours and quantiﬁed by use of the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay
(Promega).
Combination studies
Following single-agent IC50 determination, neuroblastoma
cells were plated in duplicate in 96-well plates and treated with
2 agents at doses ranging in a 2-fold difference above and below
each individual IC50 (i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4). Combination indices were determined using CalcuSyn software via
the Chou–Talalay method (22). All combination studies were
repeated at least once (total of n  4 for each cell line).
Western blotting
Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (21, 23).
Neuroblastoma cell lines or primary tumor lysates (40 mg) were
separated on 4% to 12% gradient polyacrylamide gels via SDSPAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes
(Millipore). Primary antibody dilutions included 1:1,000 Chk1,
Chk1S296, Wee1, Wee1S642, p-H2A.X(S139), Cdc2(Y15), cleaved
PARP (Asp214) and 1:3,000 b-actin (Cell Signaling).
In vivo studies
CB17SC-M SCID/ mice were used to propagate subcutaneously implanted neuroblastoma xenografts. Caliper measurements were obtained, and tumor volumes were calculated using
the formula, (p/6)  d2, where d represents the mean diameter.
Once the tumor was greater than 200 mm3, mice bearing
neuroblastoma tumors were randomized to treatment arms of:
(i) 30 mg/kg/dose twice daily intraperitoneal MK-8776, (ii) 30
mg/kg/dose twice daily per os MK-1775, (iii) the 2 compounds
combined, or (iv) vehicle control administered for 5 consecutive

to cellular dependence on this pathway. To elucidate mechanisms underlying sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition, we interrogated
Wee1—a serine/threonine kinase that signals through a pathway complimentary to Chk1. In a manner similar to Chk1,
we observed robust expression of Wee1 protein levels with
extensive phosphorylation in a comprehensive panel (n ¼ 18)
of neuroblastoma lines. In addition, canonical signal transduction through the Wee1 pathway was intact in these neuroblastoma lines, as phosphorylation of Cdc2 at Y15 often
phenocopied Wee1 activation (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig.
S1A). In contrast, substantial Wee1 expression or activation
was not detected in DAOY medulloblastoma or the h-tert
immortalized nontransformed, retinal pigmented epithelial
(RPE-1) cells. Similarly, the several adult tumor types we
investigated revealed very low basal Wee1 activity in comparison to what was observed for neuroblastoma (Supplementary
Fig. S1B).

of 28 days or until tumor volume reached 3 cm3. The Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA) Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies.
Statistical analysis
Group comparisons were determined with a 2-tailed t test.
For the xenograft studies, a linear mixed-effects model was
used to test the difference in the rate of tumor volume changing
over time between different the vehicle group and treatment
groups.

Dual Inhibition of Chk1/Wee1 in Neuroblastoma

To exclude the possibility that robust Wee1 activity was
solely an artifact of DNA damage induction during cell culturing, we examined the Wee1 status in patient primary tumor
samples obtained at diagnosis. As shown in Fig. 1B, 7 of 12 highrisk samples (58.3%) had appreciable p-Wee1 expression compared with 2 of 7 low-risk patient samples (28.5%). These
ﬁndings were supported by immunohistochemical evidence
of Wee1 phosphorylation (Ser642) obtained by staining neuroblastoma tissue microarray representing tumors from 91
patients. We again found that high-risk neuroblastoma tumors
had increased levels of Wee1 phosphorylation compared with
low-risk tumors (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1C). Finally, quantiﬁcation of
Wee1 mRNA expression levels in a large number of neuroblastoma tumor samples (n ¼ 251) conﬁrmed, such as Chk1, there
was signiﬁcantly higher expression in high-risk, MYCN-ampliﬁed tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together, these
data show that Wee1 expression and activity appears significantly elevated in neuroblastoma—particularly in MYCNampliﬁed, high-risk disease.

Neuroblastoma is sensitive to targeted Chk1/Wee1
inhibition
To ascertain the contribution of Wee1 signaling in neuroblastoma, we depleted Wee1 in 3 neuroblastoma lines using
siRNA. Depletion of Wee1 substantially inhibited the growth
and viability of neuroblastoma cell lines (Fig. 2A). To assess the
effect of pharmacologic kinase inhibition, we tested smallmolecule inhibitors of Chk1 (MK-8776) and Wee1 (MK-1775)
on neuroblastoma growth and viability. The majority of neuroblastoma lines were sensitive to single-agent inhibition of
Chk1 (82%) or Wee1 (91%), with median IC50s of roughly 900
and 300 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 2B). We subsequently conﬁrmed that the observed decrease in cell viability was due
primarily to apoptosis, rather than cell-cycle arrest as we
observed activation of caspase-3/7 or cleavage of PARP in 8
neuroblastoma lines (Fig. 2C). We also tested 2 murine tumor
lines derived from the MYCN transgenic mouse model to
examine the consequence of MYCN expression on the potency
of these inhibitors (24). Both single-agent Wee1 and Chk1

inhibition were cytotoxic in these MYCN-derived lines, with
the MYCN homozygous line roughly twice as sensitive to both
Chk1 and Wee1 inhibition than the heterozygous line, although
this was not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 3A). We conﬁrmed
target engagement in these murine cells, with the expected
ATR compensatory Chk1S345 phosphorylation in response to
MK-8776 administration (25) and a decrease in Cdc2Y15 phosphorylation following exposure to MK-1775 (Fig. 3B).
Chk1 and Wee1 inhibition acts synergistically with
chemotherapy in neuroblastoma cells
Current development strategies for Chk1/Wee1 inhibitors
have been focused on their chemosensitizing properties, leading us to assess the ability of these compounds to potentiate
both a topoisomerase inhibitor (irinotecan) and a nucleoside
analog (gemcitabine) in our neuroblastoma cell line panel.
Before combination experiments, we calculated single-agent
IC50s for both SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) and
gemcitabine for our neuroblastoma cell line panel (n ¼ 10)
using a 4-log dose–response cell viability assay with a 72-hour
time point. We subsequently combined either MK-1775 (Wee1)
or MK-8776 (Chk1), with these chemotherapeutic agents as
well as each other, to generate a combination index (CI) value

Simultaneous inhibition of Chk1 and Wee1 results in
substantial DNA double-strand breakage
In an effort to elucidate downstream events responsible for
the synergistic cytotoxicity in the MK-8776/MK-1775 combination group, we examined pathway signaling following pharmacologic disruption. As expected, there was a substantial
inhibition of Cdc2 phosphorylation downstream of Wee1
following administration of MK-1775 and decreased CHK1
phosphorylation following administration of MK-8776, at
doses at or below the respective IC50s in sensitive lines (Fig. 4;
Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, inhibition of Wee1
resulted in a modest accumulation of DNA double-strand

Table S1). Nearly all of our neuroblastoma lines had a pronounced synergistic effect when combining these inhibitors
with either SN-38 (7 of 10 cell lines for both MK-1775 and MK8776) or gemcitabine (8 of 10 lines for MK-1775, 10 of 10 cell

is potent cytotoxicity in almost all neuroblastoma lines when
combining MK-1775 and MK-8776 (9 of 10), suggesting that the

combination.

breaks as evidenced by sustained phosphorylation of histone
H2A.X (Fig. 4A). Similarly, although inhibition of Chk1 alone
did result in activation of histone H2A.X, MK-8776 in combination with chemotherapy potentiated the DNA-damaging
aspect of both SN-38 and gemcitabine (Fig. 4B). The dual
combination of MK-1775 and MK-8776 resulted in greater
than additive histone H2A.X phosphorylation (lane 6) than
either inhibitor alone (lanes 4 and 7) and caused DNA
damage equivalent to that induced by the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, despite the presence of DNA damage, cells were unable to inhibit the cell cycle
as evidenced by Cdc2 phosphorylation. This suggests that
mitotic progression is occurring in the presence of damaged
DNA, and this has been shown to be indicative of mitotic
catastrophe (18).
Dual Chk1/Wee1 inhibition is efﬁcacious in vivo
On the basis of the dual efﬁcacy of MK-8776 and MK-1775
in our in vitro models, we administered Wee1 and Chk1
combination therapy to mice bearing neuroblastoma
tumors. Mice harboring xenografts from NB-1643 or SKNAS
cell lines were treated with vehicle control, MK-1775, or MK8776 (each dosed at approximately half the single-agent
maximum tolerated dose) or the combination of MK-1775
and MK-8776, dosed daily 5 times for 2 weeks, with 1 week
off. The regimen was well tolerated. Mice receiving both the
Wee1 and Chk1 inhibitors had a reduction in tumor growth
rate as compared with control mice receiving vehicle alone
(P < 0.0001 for NB-1643, P < 0.05 for SKNAS; Fig. 5A;

Supplementary Fig. S4). Mice with NB-1643 tumors showed
growth inhibition with single-agent MK-1775 (P ¼ 0.042),
whereas mice harboring SKNAS tumors responded to singleagent MK-8776 (P ¼ 0.023), which with Bonferroni correction does not meet the signiﬁcant P value of P  0.017,
presumably due to the lower single-agent doses chosen.
Tumor resection following 48 hours of treatment (4 doses)
with these inhibitors showed the expected reduction of
the Chk1 (S296) autophosphorylation site in the MK-8776
group, as well as abrogation of Cdc2 (Y15) phosphorylation in the MK-1775–treated mice bearing NB-1643 tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S4) and EBC1 tumors (Fig. 5B). These
in vivo markers of pathway inhibition mimic those seen
in our in vitro experiments and provide a rationale for the
biologic effect of tumor growth inhibition seen in these
experiments.

Discussion
Children with high-risk neuroblastoma have a poor prognosis despite toxicity-limiting chemotherapy, emphasizing the
need to develop novel targeted therapies for the treatment of
this disease (1–3). Because an unbiased siRNA screen previously identiﬁed unique sensitivity to DDR pathway interference in neuroblastoma and because Wee1 ultimately impacts
Cdc2 via pathways complementary to Chk1 signaling, we
focused our current research efforts on combination therapies
targeting this pathway. Elevated expression and phosphorylation of Wee1 was observed in neuroblastoma cell lines, particularly in contrast to other cancer cell types. In addition, both

inhibition results in accumulation
of DNA double-strand breaks and
mitotic catastrophe. A, Be2C cells
treated with MK-1775 showed an
abrogation of Cdc2 activity with a
concomitant increase in H2A.X
phosphorylation, indicative of DNA
damage. B, inhibition of Chk1, on
the other hand, results in only
marginal increases in gH2A.X;
however, in combination with
chemotherapy, MK-8776 rapidly
(2 hours) induces double-strand
breaks (shown in NB-1643 cells).
C, simultaneous inhibition of Chk1
and Wee1 (16 hours) resulted in
robust H2A.x activation and
complete abolishment of Cdc2

Chk1 and Wee1 expression were signiﬁcantly elevated in
samples obtained from high-risk, MYCN-ampliﬁed tumors,
suggesting that these tumors may be particularly sensitive to
pathway perturbation (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).
We previously showed that induction of MYCN activity
resulted in Chk1S296 phosphorylation, which we reasoned to
be a DDR due to replicative stress (6). In support of this theory,
2 lines derived from MYCN transgenic mice were both highly
sensitive to single-agent Chk1 or Wee1 inhibition, with the
MYCN homozygous line twice as sensitive as the heterozygous
line (Fig. 3). These results support the hypothesis that MYCNdriven replicative stress may underlie aberrant activation of
the DDR pathway in neuroblastoma, resulting in a dependence
on Chk1/Wee1 signaling to maintain cell viability. Indeed,
siRNA-mediated depletion of Wee1 signiﬁcantly impairs cell
viability, and the majority of neuroblastoma cells show singleagent sensitivity to Wee1 or Chk1 inhibition, with IC50s in
physiologically attainable ranges (Fig. 2). Consequently, sustained inhibition of Chk1 or Wee1 results in apoptosis as
evidenced by PARP cleavage and activation of caspase-3/7.
Rationale for the development of Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors
as chemosensitizers is based on their role as integrative
regulators of the cell cycle and DDR pathways. To assess
chemopotentiation in neuroblastoma, combination strategies
using gemcitabine and SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) were tested across a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines.
Gemcitabine, although not used for the treatment of neuroblastoma (26), has been previously shown to be potently
chemosensitized by Chk1 and Wee1 inhibition (9, 20), whereas

782

Cancer Res; 73(2) January 15, 2013

irinotecan is used clinically for treatment of relapsed neuroblastoma (27). Nearly all neuroblastoma cell lines were found
to show synergy in a variety of combinations (Table 1). Dual
inhibition of Chk1 and Wee1 was highly synergistic in nearly
every line—equivalent to, or exceeding many of the chemotherapy combinations. In support of these ﬁndings, recent data
from Davies and colleagues showed that dual Chk1/Wee1
inhibition was synergistic in several different cancer lines and
suggested that further studies be done to identify sensitive
cancer cell types or if p53 status dependency were necessary
(10). Here, we have shown that Chk1 and Wee1 inhibition in
combination with chemotherapy is synergistic in virtually all
neuroblastomas tested and is likely due to the sensitivity to
DDR pathway interference in this disease.
Investigating the cellular signaling events following pathway
perturbation yielded some insights to explain the potency
observed in the Chk1/Wee1 combination (Fig. 4). Exposure
to single-agent MK-1775 results in a continuous abrogation of
Cdc2Y15 signaling concurrent with sustained H2A.X phosphorylation indicative of double-stranded DNA breakage (28).
Although MK-8776–mediated inhibition of Chk1 resulted in
DNA damage, exposure to chemotherapy-induced activation
of Chk1, and therefore concomitant inhibition of Chk1 resulted
in increased DNA damage compared with chemotherapy
alone. Finally, simultaneous inhibition of Chk1 and Wee1
signaling resulted in robust accumulation of DNA damage as
evidenced by H2A.X phosphorylation. Therefore, it appears
that dual Chk1/Wee1 inhibition induces DNA strand breakage
similar to that observed in combinations with chemotherapy,

accounting for the comparable synergy we observed in many of
our neuroblastoma lines. Furthermore, as we also observed a
complete absence of Cdc2 phosphorylation following Chk1/
Wee1 inhibition, it is likely that mitotic progression is proceeding with damaged DNA, leading to mitotic catastrophe
and resultant apoptosis. In support of this hypothesis, data
from Potapova and colleagues recently showed that simultaneous inhibition of Wee1 and the Cdc25 family members
results in irreversible mitotic progression (29).
On the basis of the cumulative results of these in vitro
experiments, we chose a highly sensitive (SKNAS) and moderately sensitive (NB-1643) neuroblastoma line to investigate
the in vivo efﬁcacy of targeted Chk1/Wee1 combination therapy, noting that the SKNAS xenograft is highly chemoresistant
in vivo. We chose a dosing strategy intended to recapitulate a
clinically relevant schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off and
our linear mixed-effects analysis accounted for data through
the entire cycle, and not just during dosing. For NB-1643, there
remained a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in tumor burden
with dual Chk1/Wee1 inhibition, even after treatment had
stopped. For SKNAS, however, there was signiﬁcant reduction
while being dosed, but regrowth after treatment was stopped,
suggesting that for some tumors it may be necessary to
continually dose, or combine with chemotherapy in the manner with which these inhibitors were designed and are being
developed. Nonetheless, these results argue strongly for
further optimization of a Chk1/Wee inhibition strategy in
neuroblastoma.

Conclusion
In conclusion, these results strengthen previous ﬁndings
that neuroblastoma is particularly susceptible to therapies
targeting the DDR pathway. In addition, because many

www.aacrjournals.org

relapsed neuroblastomas are refractory to conventional
chemotherapy, targeted inhibition of Chk1 and Wee1 also
serves to sensitize these tumors to currently used agents.
The ﬁnding that Wee1 is highly expressed in neuroblastoma,
particularly in high-risk, MYCN-ampliﬁed tumors, provides
rationale for targeting this kinase. We have shown that
neuroblastoma is sensitive to single-agent inhibition of Chk1
and Wee1 through the use of 2 small-molecule inhibitors,
MK-8776 and MK-1775. These compounds act synergistically
when combined with gemcitabine and irinotecan (SN-38), or
with each other, by inducing DNA double-strand breaks and
forcing cells to undergo mitotic catastrophe and subsequently, apoptosis. Furthermore, dual inhibition therapy of
Chk1 and Wee1 is able to substantially inhibit the growth of
neuroblastoma xenografts in vivo. Taken together, these data
show the effectiveness of dual inhibition therapies aimed at
targeting the DNA damage repair pathways in pediatric
neuroblastoma.
