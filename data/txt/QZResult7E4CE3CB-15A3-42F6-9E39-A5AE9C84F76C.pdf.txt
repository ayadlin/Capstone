Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Overcoming cellular mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance to drug therapy remains a
central challenge in the clinical management of many cancers, including non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). While much work has linked the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
cancer cells to the emergence of drug resistance, it is less clear where tractable routes may exist to
reverse or inhibit EMT as a strategy for drug sensitization. Here, we demonstrate that ERK1/2
(MAPK3/1) signaling plays a key role in directing the mesenchymal character of NSCLC cells,
and that blocking ERK signaling is sufficient to heighten therapeutic responses to EGFR
inhibitors. MEK1/2 (MAPKK1/2) inhibition promoted an epithelial phenotype in NSCLC cells,
preventing induction of EMT by exogenous TGFβ. Moreover, in cells exhibiting de novo or
acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, MEK inhibition enhanced sensitivity to
gefitinib and slowed cell migration. These effects only occurred, however, if MEK was inhibited
for a period sufficient to trigger changes in EMT marker expression. Consistent with these
findings, changes in EMT phenotypes and markers were also induced by expression of mutant
KRAS in a MEK-dependent manner. Our results suggest that prolonged exposure to MEK or ERK
inhibitors may not only restrain EMT but overcome naïve or acquired resistance of NSCLC to
EGFR-targeted therapy in the clinic.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) over-expression and -activation are hallmarks of
many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Consequently, a number of
inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR have been developed and approved for
various cancers. Unfortunately, these drugs are generally ineffective. In NSCLC, response to
EGFR inhibitors is limited mainly to the rare patients (~10%) whose tumors harbor somatic,
kinase-activated mutants of EGFR (1, 2). Even these patients almost invariably develop
resistance to EGFR inhibitors, often through the EGFR “gatekeeper” mutation (T790M) (3,
4) or through up-regulation of c-MET or other receptors (5). Combination therapies present
a possible strategy to overcome resistance. In NSCLC, recent investigations suggest promise
for combining EGFR inhibitors with chemoradiation (6), the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib

(7), or a c-MET inhibitor (8). Scheduling multiple drugs such that initial therapy reprograms
cells to respond to another drug is another possible strategy. In one recent example, triplenegative breast cancer cells and NSCLC cells were dramatically sensitized to doxorubicin
by pretreatment with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (9).
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is another pathway through which cancers of
epithelial origin become chemoresistant. EMT is a developmental process whereby
epithelial cells lose cell-cell adhesions to become more motile and invasive. Cells
undergoing EMT lose expression of epithelial markers (e.g., E-cadherin) and gain
expression of mesenchymal markers (e.g., vimentin and fibronectin) through differential
expression and activation of transcription factors including Twist, ZEB1, and Snail (10, 11).
EMT is frequently hijacked in metastatic progression, and mesenchymal dedifferentiation
has been associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors, chemotherapy, and other targeted
drugs in cancers of the lung (12–14), bladder (15), head and neck (16, 17), pancreas (18),
and breast (19). In NSCLC, in vitro acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib can
result from selection of a mesenchymal sub-population (20), and restoring E-cadherin
expression in mesenchymal-like NSCLC cells potentiates sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors
(21). Additionally, growing evidence for AXL-mediated EGFR inhibitor resistance has been
tied to EMT (22). Thus, developing treatments that elicit a mesenchymalepithelial transition
(MET) could be a useful approach for expanding the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors.

Several studies have demonstrated a requirement for extracellular signal-regulated
kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2, or MAPK3/1) pathway activity in EMT induced by transforming
growth factor beta (TGFβ) in non-transformed cells (23–25). ERK2, but not ERK1, activity
also induces EMT in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells (26) and has been
implicated as mediating oncogenic KRAS-induced invasion in pancreatic cancer cells (27).
Interestingly, ERK2 amplification was recently identified as a mechanism leading to
acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC (28).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here, we sought to determine ERK’s role in governing EMT in NSCLC. In a panel of
NSCLC cell lines, inhibition of MEK1/2 (MAPKK1/2) prevented TGFβ-induced EMT and
promoted epithelial cellular characteristics when administered alone. Conversely,
augmented ERK activation, through KRAS12V expression or ERK2 amplification, promoted
mesenchymal characteristics. Furthermore, chronic MEK inhibition for times long enough to
observe changes in epithelial and mesenchymal marker expression augmented cellular
sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in cell lines with de novo or acquired resistance to
EGFR inhibitors. These changes were reversible and accompanied by shifts in expression of
stem cell-like markers CD24 and CD44. These results suggest the potential utility of drug
scheduling strategies first targeting ERK to promote epithelial characteristics prior to
targeting EGFR or other oncogenic signaling nodes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
H1666 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. H322, gefitinibresistant PC9 (clone GR4, referred to as GR henceforth), and WZ4002-resistant PC9 cells
(clone WZR12, referred to as WZR henceforth) were provided by Dr. Pasi Jänne (DanaFarber Cancer Institute). Parental PC9 cells were provided by Dr. Douglas Lauffenburger
(MIT). Since PC9 cells came from different labs, we confirmed similar expression of
important proteins and response to gefitinib for parental stocks from both labs. H358 cells
were provided by Dr. Russ Carstens (University of Pennsylvania). PC9 (all variants), H322,
and H358 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL
penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 1 mM L-glutamine. H1666 cells were maintained in

ACL4 (29). Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies. Cell lines were validated for
anticipated responsiveness to gefitinib and were cultured for less than two months from lowpassage frozen stocks.
Chronic MEK inhibition
H1666, PC9 GR, and PC9 WZR cells were maintained in 10 µM, 5 µM, and 20 µM U0126,
respectively, with controls maintained in DMSO. Responses to 1 hr or 2 day treatments with
a range of U0126 concentrations were evaluated for each cell line to identify U0126
concentrations yielding significantly inhibited ERK phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig.
S1) but minimal background cell death. For culture experiments, media was changed every
two days or cells were passed as necessary. When passing, cells were sub-cultured into
inhibitor-free media to promote adhesion. U0126 or DMSO was replaced the following day.
When appropriate, cells were lysed or gefitinib was added 24 hrs later. Time points in
figures with chronic MEK inhibition reflect the total time of U0126 exposure before lysing
or gefitinib addition. To probe the reversibility of U0126 effects, cells were split from
U0126 cultures after 7 days and maintained in DMSO thereafter. All time courses were
performed from freshly thawed cells multiple times to demonstrate reproducibility. Naïve
cell death response to U0126 and gefitinib was quantified at multiple points during time
courses, including the beginning and end, to verify that baseline response was not changing.

Wound healing assay
Confluent cell monolayers in 6-well plates were scratched with a pipet tip, and media was
immediately changed. Phase contrast images were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL
microscope (10X objective) every 1–3 hrs for ≤11 hrs. Scratch areas were quantified using
ImageJ, and closure rates were calculated from linear fits of areas versus time and reported
as percent of total image area closed per hr normalized to the conditions indicated in figures.
Where inhibitors were used, cells were plated at sub-confluence and treated at appropriate
times with media containing inhibitor. Media and inhibitor were changed every two days
until wells reached confluence.
Transwell migration assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Untreated PC9 GR and WZR cells or H1666 cells treated with U0126 or DMSO for 4 days
were trypsinized and resuspended in media containing 0.1% FBS and U0126 or DMSO for
H1666. 20,000 untreated or DMSO-treated cells or 50,000 U0126-treated cells (adjusted for
U0126-mediated changes in adhesion) were added to 8 µm Transwell membranes (Corning),
which were placed in 24-well plates well containing complete media with DMSO or U0126.
After 20 hrs, cells on the upper surfaces were removed with a cotton swab. Cells on the
lower surfaces were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed with PBS, and
nuclei were stained with Hoescht-33342. Membranes were mounted and imaged (10X
objective), and nuclei were counted using ImageJ. Counts were normalized to the number of
adhered cells from parallel wells for each condition.
Flow cytometry
For cell death assays, cells were plated in 6-well dishes from their various culture conditions
and treated with inhibitors. Floating and adherent cells were collected 48 hrs later,
resuspended in PBS containing TO-PRO3 (Life Technologies), and analyzed within 1 hr.
For CD24 and CD44 measurements, cells were collected as above, washed with 0.1% BSA
in PBS (PBSA), blocked for 10 min in PBSA, and incubated for 1 hr with 3 µL each of
FITC-conjugated anti-human CD44 antibody (BD Pharmingen, #555478) and Alexa-647
conjugated anti-human CD24 antibody (BioLegend, #311109) in 200 µL. Labeled cells were

washed again and resuspended in PBS. Cytometry was performed on a BD Biosciences
FACSCalibur cytometer, and data were analyzed using FlowJo.

Antibodies and other reagents
pERK T202/Y204 (#4377) and ERK (#4695) antibodies were from Cell Signaling
Technology. E-cadherin (sc-8426), vimentin (sc-373717), fibronectin (sc-8422), and
GAPDH (sc-32233) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Stocks of U0126 and
gefitinib (LC Labs) were prepared in DMSO. Recombinant human epidermal growth factor
(EGF) and TGFβ were from Peprotech. Infrared dye- and Alexa Fluor®-conjugated
secondary antibodies were from Rockland Immunochemicals and Invitrogen, respectively.
Additional methods
Western blotting, immunofluorescence, KRAS12V expression, experiments involving
CI-1040, chronic MEK inhibition in H322, H358, and SKRB3 cells, and the EGFR
internalization assay were performed as described in Supplemental Materials.

RESULTS
NSCLC cell lines undergo MEK-dependent TGFβ-induced EMT

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

H1666, H322, and H358 cells were cultured in complete media with TGFβ and EGF with or
without U0126 for four days, with a media change after two days (Fig. 1). In response to
TGFβ and EGF, E-cadherin expression decreased and vimentin expression increased in all
three cell lines, and fibronectin expression increased in H1666 and H358 cells (Fig. 1A).
U0126 co-treatment inhibited changes in E-cadherin and vimentin, but did not prevent
fibronectin induction. The same trends were found in H1666 cells using the alternative MEK
inhibitor CI-1040 (Supplementary Fig. S2). The conditions used in Fig. 1A were explored in
H1666 cells by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B). Treatment with TGFβ and EGF promoted an
elongated cellular morphology, the appearance of F-actin fibers, and decreased E-cadherin
intensity. U0126 addition prevented E-cadherin loss and promoted E-cadherin localization at
cell-cell junctions.
MEK inhibition promotes epithelial phenotypes in NSCLC cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next explored the ability of MEK inhibition alone to promote epithelial characteristics in
H1666 cells. As seen when combined with TGFβ and EGF, U0126 promoted E-cadherin
localization at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 2A). MEK inhibition also antagonized H1666 wound
healing in a treatment timedependent manner (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. S3). While
U0126 inhibited ERK phosphorylation within 1 hr of addition (Supplementary Fig. S1),
U0126 treatment for the duration of the scratch assay (10 hrs) did not significantly affect
wound closure rate (“at scratch” condition versus DMSO in Fig. 2B). Wound closure rate
decreased significantly with 1 day of U0126 pre-treatment and was nearly zero with four
days of pre-treatment. Western blots of lysates created in parallel revealed that E-cadherin
expression increased and vimentin expression decreased with increasing U0126 exposure
time, consistent with the time-dependent changes in wound closure rate (Fig. 2C,
Supplementary Fig. S3). U0126-mediated changes in wound healing migration were further
confirmed by assessing migration across Transwell inserts (Fig. 2D).
Chronic MEK inhibition sensitizes NSCLC cells to EGFR inhibition on a time scale
consistent with changes in epithelial and mesenchymal markers
Since epithelial characteristics have been connected to EGFR dependence in NSCLC (14,
21), we explored the ability of MEK inhibition to increase sensitivity to gefitinib (Fig. 3). As
described in Materials and Methods, H1666 cells were maintained in 10 µM U0126 or

DMSO (control) for up to 3 weeks. Throughout the 3-week period, cells were evaluated for
death response to gefitinib. Without U0126 pre-treatment, 2 days of EGFR and MEK coinhibition led to only 7% cell death in H1666, but this more than doubled with 3 days of
U0126 pre-treatment (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S4A). This enhancement further
increased with additional U0126 pre-treatment time, reaching a maximum at 11 days.
Increased cellular sensitivity to gefitinib was accompanied by increased E-cadherin
expression (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S4B). Beyond 11 days, the synergistic effect began
to decrease, which was accompanied by increased fibronectin expression and decreased Ecadherin expression. Similar effects were observed in H1666 cells using CI- 1040
(Supplementary Fig. S4C).
H358 and H322 cells and the breast cancer cell line SKBR3 were also evaluated for
response to gefitinib following chronic MEK inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S5). H358 cells
harbor a KRAS mutation and are ERK-addicted (30). Not surprisingly therefore, H358
response to gefitinib was not augmented by U0126 pre-treatment. However, H322 and
SKBR3 cells were sensitized to EGFR inhibition with 5 days of U0126 exposure, suggesting
fairly broad applicability of this strategy.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also probed the reversibility of the effects of chronic MEK inhibition in H1666 cells
(Fig. 3C-E, Supplementary Fig. S6). After 7 days, a fraction of cells was split from the
U0126 culture and maintained in media containing DMSO (control). This “U0126 removal”
culture was subsequently plated in parallel with the cells maintained in U0126. After 7 days
of U0126 exposure, removal from U0126 for 4 days completely reversed changes in cellular
sensitivity to gefitinib and epithelial and mesenchymal marker expression (Fig. 3C, D,
Supplementary Fig. S6A).
Stem cell-like sub-populations with intrinsic therapeutic resistance are found within tumors
(20, 31) and are typically identified as CD44high/CD24low (20) or E-cadherinlow (32).
CD44high/CD24low enrichment from heterogeneous cultures promotes mesenchymal
behaviors including resistance to EGFR inhibitors (20). Using flow cytometry, we measured
the shift in the CD44high/CD24low sub-population with U0126 addition and subsequent
removal (Fig. 3E, Supplementary Fig. S6B). U0126-treated cells had fewer CD44high/
CD24low cells and more CD44low/CD24high cells than controls. As with epithelial/
mesenchymal marker expression, U0126 removal for four days reversed the effect on the
CD44low/CD24high population.
KRAS12V-mediated ERK activation promotes EMT

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further probe the connection between ERK activity and EMT, we expressed KRAS12V in
H1666 cells. This produced an anticipated increase in ERK phosphorylation and increased
vimentin expression (Fig. 4A). Gefitinib and U0126 promoted an epithelial shift in control
cells, as determined by western blot and wound closure measurements (Fig. 4A, B).
KRAS12V promoted maintenance of ERK phosphorylation in response to gefitinib and
largely prevented gefitinib-mediated changes in marker expression and wound closure (Fig.
4A, B). Importantly, the effects of KRAS12V were MEK-dependent, as demonstrated by the
effects of U0126 (Fig. 4).
MEK inhibition antagonizes mesenchymal phenotypes and acquired resistance to EGFR
inhibition in an EGFR mutant-expressing cell line
We tested the effects of chronic MEK inhibition in a panel of cell lines derived from PC9
cells, which express EGFRdelE746_A750 and are gefitinib sensitive. In parental PC9 cells,
MEK inhibition prevented TGFβ-mediated EMT and drove changes in epithelial/

mesenchymal marker expression and wound healing consistent with the effects observed in
H1666 cells (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S7).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A previous study derived PC9 cells that acquired gefitinib resistance through EGFRT790M
mutation (28). Another cell line was then derived from these cells with secondary resistance
to the irreversible EGFR inhibitor WZ4002, which potently inhibits EGFRT790M (28, 33).
WZ4002 resistance arose through ERK2 amplification. We used these gefitinib-resistant
(GR) and WZ4002-resistant (WZR) clones to examine the effects of ERK2 activity, which
has been tied to EMT in non-transformed cells (26). WZR cells displayed a more
mesenchymal marker expression pattern than parental or GR cells, with increased
fibronectin and vimentin expression and decreased E-cadherin expression (Fig. 6A). WZR
cells were also more migratory than GR cells as measured by wound closure and Transwell
migration (Fig. 6B, C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The effects of chronic MEK inhibition were tested in GR and WZR cells, using a higher
U0126 concentration for WZR because of the ERK2 amplification. Death response to
cotreatment was enhanced by approximately two-fold with three days of U0126 pretreatment in both cell lines (Fig. 7A, Supplementary Fig. S8A,B). As in H1666 cells,
sufficiently long U0126 exposure resulted in an eventual decrease in augmented response to
EGFR inhibition. Increased sensitivity to gefitinib correlated with reduced vimentin
expression and slight increases in E-cadherin expression, and the eventual decrease in
augmentation was accompanied by increased fibronectin expression in WZR cells
(fibronectin was not detectable in GR cells) (Fig. 7B, Supplementary Fig. S8C).

DISCUSSION
We characterized the role of ERK in regulating EMT in NSCLC cells. MEK inhibition
prevented TGFβ-induced EMT in NSCLC cell lines expressing wild-type EGFR and KRAS
(H1666 and H322), wild-type EGFR and mutant KRAS (H358), or mutant EGFR (PC9).
This suggests a general role for ERK in promoting mesenchymal characteristics across
typical NSCLC cell types. MEK inhibition also antagonized mesenchymal-associated
characteristics including migration, resistance to EGFR inhibition, and CD44high/CD24low
expression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The role of ERK in EMT has been explored in other cell types. ERK is an established
determinant of EMT in non-transformed cells (23, 34–36), with ERK2 specifically
implicated as an EMT driver (26, 27, 37). This is consistent with findings in breast cancer
(38), where MEK inhibition reverses miR-21-mediated EMT, and with studies of
phosphatases regulating ERK (i.e., MKP3, PTPN14, and SHP2) (39–41), which also suggest
a connection between ERK activity and EMT.
A number of factors regulate ERK activity in NSCLC cells. We previously demonstrated a
connection of impaired mutant EGFR endocytosis with a diminished functional role of
SHP2 and impaired ERK activity (29, 42). More recently, in collaboration with others, we
identified a coupling between ERK2 amplification and increased EGFR endocytosis in the
WZ4002-resistant PC9 cells used here (28). Interestingly, inhibiting EGFR endocytosis in
WZ4002-resistant cells reduced ERK phosphorylation and promoted an epithelial marker
expression pattern (Supplementary Fig. S9), drawing a potential connection between EGFR
endocytosis and EMT. More recently, Sprouty2 has been shown to promote ERK activity in
NSCLC cells with or without EGFR mutations (43).
Of course, KRAS mutations may also promote ERK activity in NSCLC. In H1666 cells,
KRAS12V-driven ERK activity promoted mesenchymal marker expression and resistance to

gefitinib-mediated MET changes. These findings are generally consistent with studies
connecting oncogenic HRAS or KRAS mutants with EMT in mammary epithelia (26),
pancreatic cancer (27, 30), and lung cancer (30). The MEK dependence of our observations
with KRAS12V may support exploration of MEK and ERK inhibitors in NSCLCs with
KRAS mutation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to promoting epithelial marker expression, MEK inhibition promoted response to
EGFR inhibition. Some studies have suggested the efficacy of EGFR and MEK coinhibition
in gastric cancer (44) and pancreatic cancer cells (45), and current clinical trials are testing
erlotinib combined with MEK inhibitors in NSCLC. In light of this, it is worth noting that
the effects we observed with MEK inhibition occurred on a time scale that was much longer
than that for ERK inhibition and more consistent with changes in epithelial and
mesenchymal marker expression. This may suggest considering a clinical scheduling
approach wherein a MEK inhibitor is initially used alone to promote an epithelial
phenotype, followed by addition of an EGFR inhibitor. An analogous staggered drug
scheduling approach was effective in triple negative breast cancer cells which were
sensitized to doxorubicin by erlotinib pre-treatment in vitro and in mouse tumor xenografts
(9). Applying this basic concept to future clinical trial design may allow for lower MEK
inhibitor doses to curb toxicities (46) and promote response to EGFR inhibitors. Given that
the time windows for augmented response to gefitinib and the useful concentrations of
U0126 were variable among cell lines, it will of course be important first to examine this
strategy in pre-clinical animal models to assess general efficacy in an in vivo setting and
optimize timing and dosing.
We note as well that some recent data suggests that MET is required for efficient
colonization of distant metastases (47, 48). Thus, in evaluating different potential strategies
for driving MET, the potential to drive proliferation of metastases will have to be weighed
against potential ability to kill tumor cells. ERK may be an especially attractive target in this
regard. In at least one study, ERK inhibition through microRNA-mediated reduction of
SHP2 (a positive regulator of ERK signaling) reduced metastases in an in vivo breast cancer
model (49), which was due to SHP2’s simultaneous regulation of proliferation, invasion, and
transcription factor expression. Thus, promoting MET through ERK inhibition, which
should additionally inhibit cellular proliferation, may mitigate risks associated with
proliferation of micrometastases.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In all three cell lines we tested for effects of chronic MEK inhibition, enhanced gefitinib
response eventually decreased. Though initially unresponsive to U0126, U0126-cultured
cells displayed noticeable cell death at mid-range time points (partially reflected by cell
death measurements for U0126-only samples in Figs. 3 and 7). This could result in selection
for U0126-resistant cells over time. Since the fraction of CD44high/CD24low cells in U0126treated cultures remained low at time points when resistance was observed (Fig. 3C,E), the
potentially inherently resistant population was apparently not CD44high/CD24low.
Alternatively, resistance could arise from adaptation of the entire cell population, for
example through increased fibronectin-mediated signaling, which has been linked to AKT
activation and docetaxel resistance in ovarian and breast cancer cells (50). Indeed, in all
cases, the eventual drop in augmented response to gefitinib was accompanied by increased
fibronectin expression. Future work should consider effectors of fibronectin-mediated
signaling as signaling nodes whose inhibition may augment EGFR inhibitor response.
While our data suggest potential relevance of our findings to de novo and acquired EGFR
inhibitor resistance, responsiveness to chronic MEK inhibition was not uniform among cell
lines, which could result from any of the numerous differences in initial conditions among
NSCLC cell lines. For example, while H1666 cells express wild-type EGFR and KRAS,

they also express the low-activity G446V BRAF mutant (51), which could influence their
death response to MEK inhibition. In the future, therefore, investigating the cellular initial
conditions that may determine responsiveness to this approach and identifying alternative
signaling nodes whose inhibition may result in more stable maintenance of an epithelial cell
type will also be important.
