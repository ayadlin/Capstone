Pim Kinase Inhibitors Sensitize Prostate Cancer Cells to
Apoptosis Triggered by Bcl-2 Family Inhibitor ABT-737
Jin H. Song1,3 and Andrew S. Kraft2,3

Abstract
Pim serine/threonine kinases contribute to prostate tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance, yet Pim kinase
inhibitors seem to have only limited effects on prostate cancer cell survival. Because overexpression of Bcl-2 family
members are implicated in chemotherapeutic resistance in prostate cancer, we investigated the cooperative
effects of Pim kinase inhibition with ABT-737, a small molecule antagonist of Bcl-2 family members. Strikingly, the
addition of ABT-737 to Pim inhibitors triggered a robust apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Pim
inhibitors decreased levels of the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1, both by blocking 50 -cap dependent translation and
decreasing protein half life. In addition, Pim inhibition transcriptionally increased levels of the BH3 protein Noxa
by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR), lead to eIF-2a phosphorylation and increased expression of
CHOP. Increased levels of Noxa also inactivated the remaining levels of Mcl-1 protein activity. Notably, these
speciﬁc protein changes were essential to the apoptotic process because ABT-737 did not inhibit Mcl-1 protein
activity and Mcl-1 overexpression blocked the apoptotic activity of ABT-737. Our results therefore suggest that
this combination treatment could be developed as a potential therapy for human prostate cancer where
overexpression of Pim kinases and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members drives tumor cell resistance to current
anticancer therapies. Cancer Res; 72(1); 294–303. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The Pim family of serine threonine protein kinases plays a
critical but unexplicated role in the growth and progression of
human prostate cancer (1). This enzyme family is overexpressed in human prostate cancer compared with benign
biopsies (2) and enhanced levels of nuclear Pim-2 in tumor
cells have been associated with a higher risk of prostatespeciﬁc antigen (PSA) recurrence and with perineural invasion
of the prostate gland (3). Moderate to strong cytoplasmic
staining of Pim-1 was seen in tumors of 68% of patients with
a Gleason score of 7 or higher (4). Pim-1 is overexpressed in
high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, and Pim staining
may be helpful in differentiating benign glands from intraepithelial neoplasia (2). We have previously reported that the
expression of Pim-1 in prostate cancer cells confers a growth
advantage on these tumor cells (5). Patients with high levels of

Pim-1 expression in the prostate are at signiﬁcantly greater risk
for developing metastatic cancer (6). In animals, overexpression of the c-Myc protein in the prostate induces neoplasia and
is associated with increased Pim protein kinase levels (7). In a
subrenal capsular assay for prostate regeneration, expression
of Pim-1 kinase promotes c-Myc-driven prostate carcinogenesis (8). These studies suggest that the Pim protein kinases may
be a target to inhibit prostate cancer growth.
Through chemical library screening (9), we have identiﬁed
the chemotype of benzylidene-thiazolidine-2,4-diones as a
speciﬁc Pim protein kinase inhibitor and focused on SMI-4a,
a pan isotype inhibitor, as a potential lead compound. SMI4a induces both apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in a wide
variety of leukemic cell lines (10). In addition, oral administration of SMI-4a to mice is well tolerated and causes
moderate inhibition of leukemic growth when cells are
grown as tumor xenografts (11). When administered to
prostate cancer cells, Pim inhibitors induce a cell-cycle block
but are only moderately inhibitory to growth (10). Although
the mechanism of action of this agent has not been fully
evaluated, we have shown that application of SMI-4a to both
leukemia and prostate cells inhibits mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (10, 12), possibly by activating the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). Application of Pim inhibitors
stimulates a fall in ATP levels and increases the concentration of AMP (12). Activated AMPK phosphorylates raptor
and TSC2 to block mTORC1 activity (13). AMPK activation
by Pim inhibition requires phosphorylation of Thr-172 by
LKB (12), suggesting that control of energy supplies by SMI4a could be an essential part of its activity.

Synergy between Pim Kinase Inhibitor and ABT-737

The resistance of prostate cancers to undergo apoptosis
when challenged with various chemotherapeutic agents could
be due to the overexpression of antiapoptotic members of the
Bcl-2 protein family. Studies have shown that metastatic
prostate cancer and castration-refractory tumors are positively
associated with Bcl-2 overexpression (14), so the moderate
sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to Pim kinase inhibitors
could be due to deregulated expression of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. ABT-737, a small molecule BH3 mimetic
that interacts tightly with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-w and inhibits their
activity, has the potential to overcome this resistance (15).
However, this agent does not bind to Mcl-1 and Bﬂ-1 proteins.
Research by us and others shows that Mcl-1 can constrain the
proapoptotic activity of ABT-737 (16). Recent reports showed
that that ABT-737 acquires intrinsic resistance to apoptosis by
increasing Mcl-1 binding with Bim (17), and ABT-737 resistance is associated with reduced levels of Bcl-2:Bim heterodimers (18) and high Mcl-1 expression (16, 19). Although ABT737 has generated anticancer activity in small cell lung cancer,
leukemia, and multiple myeloma, prostate cancer cells in vitro
exhibit a poor response to the proapoptotic action of ABT-737
because the Mcl-1 protein is widely expressed at high levels in
prostate cancer cell lines and inhibits the proapoptotic function of ABT-737. We have shown that ABT-737 as a single agent
has little proapoptotic activity in prostate cancer cells (20, 21).
However, the combination of ABT-737 and a Pim inhibitor is
highly synergistic in inducing apoptotic cell death. We investigated the ABT-737/Pim inhibitor synergy, with particular
focus on the mechanism by which Pim inhibitors regulate
apoptotic pathways. Thus, we suggest a rationale for this novel
combination therapy.

were transfected with pcDNA3.1-HA-Bcl-2 (23) and pcDNA3Bcl-2 (AddGene) by LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen) and then
transfectants were selected and grown in 1 mg/mL of G418
(Sigma-Aldrich).
Tumor growth in vivo
Xenografts bearing prostate tumors were generated by
injection of LNCaP cells (5  106) in the ﬂanks of the male
NU/NU nude mice (Charles River). After tumors were grown to
at least 100 mm3 (1 week after implantation), 36 mice were
randomly divided into 4 different treatment groups: Group 1
(6 mice), vehicle only (30% propylene glycol, 5% Tween-80, 65%
of 5% dextrose in water, pH 4–5); Group 2 (12 mice), 60 mg/kg
SMI-4a twice daily treatments (BID); Group 3 (6 mice),
50 mg/kg ABT-737 once a day (QD); and Group 4 (12 mice),
combination treatment with SMI-4a (BID) and ABT-737 (QD).
Mice received oral gavages for SMI-4a or/and intraperitoneal
injection for ABT-737. Treatment was begun on day 8 and
administered 5 of 7 days each week for 3 weeks. The growth of
the subcutaneous tumors was measured twice each week, and
mouse body weight was determined on days 0 and 21. Tumor
size was calculated using the equation (L  W2)/2. The
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Medical
University of South Carolina approved these animal experiments. For the immunohistochmistry of xenograft tumor
tissues, tissue slices were processed to generate 5 mm tissue
slides. Sections were stained with H&E, mouse monoclonal
antibody to human Mcl-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and
rabbit antibody to cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's protocol for these
products.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, cell culture, and chemicals
Prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, DU-145, and 22Rv1
were purchased from the ATCC. Cells were grown in DMEM or
RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L Glutamax
and 1% antibiotics (Invitrogen) as previously described (21).
Subconﬂuent cells were treated with Pim inhibitors or vehicle
in the absence of FBS. (Z)-5-(3-Triﬂuoromethylbenzylidene)
thiazolidine-2,4-dione (referred to as SMI-4a) and [Z,E]-5-[4ethylbenzylidine]-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one (referred to as
10058-F4) were from Calbiochem. For animal experiment,
SMI-4a was prepared as we reported previously (9). K00135
was purchased from BioFocus. 8-(4-Hydroxylphenyl)-2[(dimethlamino)methyl][1]benzothieno-[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4
(3H)-one (referred to as Pimi-14j; ref. 22) and ABT-737 were a
gift of Abbott Laboratories. Other chemicals of analytic grade
were purchased from EMD Chemicals and Sigma-Aldrich.
Short hairpin RNAs and plasmids

Quantitative real time PCR, immunoblotting, and
biochemical analysis
Quantitative real time PCR (qT-PCR) and immunoblot
analyses were carried out as previously reported (20) with
slight modiﬁcation as described in the Supplementary Methods. Methods for the 7-Methyl-GTP cap binding assay and
35
S-methinone incorporation were reported previously (12)
and are further described in the Supplementary Methods.

Results
Inhibition of Bcl-2 like proteins with ABT-737 synergizes
with SMI-4a to induce apoptosis
SMI-4a, a small molecule Pim kinase inhibitor, has preclinical efﬁcacy in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia (11) but the
human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and 22Rv1 only
respond modestly to SMI-4a treatment (Supplementary Fig.
S1A). To show whether the response to Pim inhibitors was Pim
speciﬁc, we knocked down the expression of all 3 Pims, 1, 2, and
3, using shRNAs. The knockdown of each of these individual
Pim kinases in LNCaP cells, as shown by qT-PCR, decreased the
growth of these human prostate cancer cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Because Bcl-2 protein family expression is associated
with resistance of prostate cancer to standard chemotherapy,
and a higher frequency of Bcl-2 expression is seen in recurrent

tumors after castration (24, 25), we examined whether combination therapy with a small molecule BH3 mimetic ABT-737
and a Pim inhibitor would provide an enhanced apoptotic
response. ABT-737 binds and induces apoptosis by inhibiting
the activity of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w. However, this compound is incapable of binding to Bcl-2 like the protein Mcl-1,
and increased expression of this protein in numerous cancer
cell types was sufﬁcient to inhibit the activity of ABT-737 (21).
ABT-737 treatment of LNCaP cells alone induced only a small
percentage of cell death, but when combined with SMI-4a, a
high degree of synergy in inducing cell death occurred (Fig. 1A).
ABT-737 treatment alone induced slight cleavage of PARP-1
(Fig. 1B), a marker of apoptosis, but when combined with SMI4a marked cleavage of this protein was seen. Similar synergistic
results were obtained with another structurally different Pim
inhibitor Pimi-14j (22), which blocks Pim activity in vitro in the
low nanomolar range (Fig. 1A). Combination therapy with this
Pim kinase inhibitor and ABT-737 induced enhanced caspase-3
and PARP-1 cleavage (Fig. 1B). A robust induction of cell death
by these 2 agents was also seen in PC-3 cells, another human
prostate cancer cell line (Supplementary Fig. S3). A third Pim
kinase inhibitor K00135 was also synergistic with ABT-737
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover, this combination overcame resistance to cell death in human prostate cancer cells
overexpressing Bcl-2 (Fig. 1C).
Pim kinase inhibitors downregulate Mcl-1 protein
expression by lowering global protein synthesis
To determine a potential mechanism by which Pim inhibitors synergize with ABT-737 to kill prostate cancer cells, we

examined the ability of SMI-4a to regulate the levels of BH3 and
Bcl-2 family member proteins important in controlling apoptotic cell death. Western blot results (Fig. 2A) show that either
inhibition of Pim kinases with SMI-4a or knockdown of Pim
kinases with shRNAs induced a marked decrease in Mcl-1 and
an increase in Noxa protein. These results are signiﬁcant
because Noxa is capable of binding and inhibiting the antiapoptotic activity of Mcl-1 and thereby overcomes ABT-737
resistance. In LNCaP cells, the levels of Mcl-1 expression were
reduced by SMI-4a treatment in a time- and dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2B). In addition, in the PC-3 cell line a decrease in
the Mcl-1 protein levels was induced by SMI-4a treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S4A) and 2 additional small molecule Pim
kinase inhibitors, K00135 and Pimi-14j (Supplementary Fig.
S4B). No signiﬁcant change in the levels of MCL-1 mRNA
occurred after the treatment with the Pim inhibitor SMI-4a
(Supplementary Fig. S4C). A further suggestion that Pim kinase
plays a role in regulating Mcl-1 protein levels comes from the
evaluation of mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts (MEF) derived from
mice that were genetically engineered to knock out all 3 Pim
proteins (TKO; ref. 12). After 35S-methionine labeling, these
MEFs showed a lower level of the Mcl-1 protein (Supplementary Fig. S4D; ref. 12). Given that MCL-1 mRNA levels were
unaffected by Pim inhibitors, we next labeled LNCaP cells with
35
S-methionine followed by immunoprecipitation and examined the Mcl-1 synthesis. Our results show that SMI-4a inhibits
the translation of this protein (Fig. 2C). In addition, 35S
methionine-labeled whole cell extracts showed that this drug
treatment suppressed total protein synthesis in LNCaP cells
(Fig. 2D). These results are identical to those previously

The percentage of cell death was evaluated using trypan blue staining assay (mean  SD, n ¼ 6). B, whole cell extracts from the above treatments
were analyzed by immunoblotting with the antibodies shown. C, PC-3 cells were transfected with HA-tagged Bcl-2 plasmid and individual clones selected
with 1 mg/mL G418 treatment. Parental PC-3 (P) cells and selected individual clones were treated with DMSO, SMI-4a, ABT-737 or combinations
of both agents at the indicated doses. The percentage of viable cells after 24 hours of treatment was determined by MTT assay (mean  SD, n ¼ 4).

obtained in TKO MEFs compared with wild type where
decreased synthesis of proteins regulated by the 50 cap and
total protein synthesis was seen (12).
Pim kinase inhibitors inhibit mTROC1-mediated protein
synthesis and increase Mcl-1 degradation
To evaluate the mechanism by which inhibition of Pim
kinases suppresses protein synthesis, the level of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 was measured after treatment of prostate cancer
cells with either shRNAs to Pim kinases or the kinase inhibitor
SMI-4a. Decreased mTORC1 activity led to increased levels of
dephosphorylated 4E-BP1, which then was bound to the eIF-4E
protein, blocking protein synthesis. We found that both knockdown of the 3 Pims and SMI-4a treatment decreased the
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Immunoprecipitation of mTORC1 followed by anti-phospho 4E-BP1
Western additionally showed that inhibition of Pim kinases
decreased mTORC1 activity (Fig. 3A). To test whether Pim
inhibition has an effect on the eIF4F assembly and cap structure recognition process, eIF4E and the proteins associated
with it were isolated with m7-GTP-sepharose beads, which
functions by mimicking the mRNA cap structure. As shown
in Fig. 3B, the amount of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 associated
with eIF-4E increased markedly in Pim-depleted cells or SMI4a treated cells, suggesting a mechanism for the inhibition of
50 cap translation. Thus, inhibition of the Pim protein kinases in
these cells decreased the activity of mTORC1 kinase.
mTORC1 activity can be negatively regulated by AMPdependent protein kinase (13), which is activated by phosphorylation on threonine 172 and increased AMP levels. We
found that treatment of both LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer
cells with SMI-4a induced increases in AMPK phosphorylation

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 3C), suggesting a potential mechanism by which the Pim
kinases could regulate the mTORC1 pathway. To test if AMPK
is required for SMI-4a to downregulate Mcl-1 expression,
LNCaP cells were treated with SMI-4a and compound C, an
AMPK inhibitor (Fig. 3D). This additional treatment partially
blocked the ability of SMI-4a to decrease Mcl-1 protein levels
suggesting that AMPK control of mTORC1 activity contributes
to this downregulation.
Because SMI-4a activity was only partially inhibited by
compound C, we examined the possibility that SMI-4a also
regulated the rate of destruction of the Mcl-1 protein. LNCaP
cells were ﬁrst treated with SMI-4a or Pimi-14j for 16 hours
followed by cycloheximide treatment to block new protein
synthesis in the absence of Pim inhibitors. Pretreatment with
SMI-4a induced much more rapid degradation of the Mcl-1
protein than cells treated with vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide,
DMSO; Fig. 3E). To further examine whether proteasomemediated Mcl-1 protein degradation occurs in cells treated
with Pim inhibitors, LNCaP cells were pretreated with the
proteasome inhibitor PS-341 (VELCADE) and then further
treated with SMI-4a. In cells treated with both compounds,
proteasome inhibition reversed the ability of the Pim inhibitor
to induce Mcl-1 protein degradation (Fig. 3F). These results
suggest that the reduction in Mcl-1 protein levels induced by
Pim inhibitor treatment is mediated by regulation of both
protein synthesis and protein degradation rate.

to pull down 50 cap components. After washing, proteins bound to the beads were probed by immunoblotting with antibodies to eIF4E and 4E-BP1. Cell lysates
(25 mg) were also immunoblotted as a control (Input). C, LNCaP and PC-3 cells were treated with either DMSO or SMI-4a (10 mmol/L) for 6 or 18 hours.

C (Cpd C) prior to treatment with either DMSO or SMI-4a (10 mmol/L) for 16 hours. Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies shown.
E, LNCaP cells were treated with DMSO or SMI-4a for 16 hours followed by cycloheximide (CHX) and cell samples were collected at the times indicated.

SMI-4a (10 mmol/L) for 16 hours. Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies shown.

LNCaP cells was also sufﬁcient to increase Noxa protein levels
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). The Noxa protein speciﬁcally binds
and inhibits the Mcl-1 protein's antiapoptotic activity. Immunoprecipitation shows that the Pim inhibitor-increased Noxa
protein bound to Mcl-1 (Fig. 4B). As seen on Western blot, the
Pim inhibitors concurrently decreased the overall levels of the
Mcl-1 protein (Fig. 4C). To determine how Pim inhibitors might
regulate Noxa protein levels, we examined the unfolded protein
response (UPR). In the condition of an energy deﬁcit, activation
of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response is known to
stimulate the UPR by eIF-2a phosphorylation and subsequent
increases in the protein levels of the ATF4 and CHOP transcription factors (39). ATF4 induces increases in the Noxa mRNA and
protein (26, 27). To clarify whether induction of Noxa by Pim
inhibitors is associated with the eIF-2a arm of UPR signaling, we
treated LNCaP cells and evaluated protein levels of these factors.
We found that SMI-4a treatment stimulates the phosphorylation of eIF-2a (Fig. 4C) and induces increases in ATF4 and CHOP
protein in a dose dependent fashion (Fig. 4D and E) similarly to
known activators of this pathway, tunicamycin (Tm) and
thasigargen (Tg; Supplementary Fig. 6B).
Pim inhibitors induce UPR followed by ER stress
On the basis of activation of eIF-2a phosphorylation, we
examined whether Pim inhibitors also induces other arms of

298

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

the ER stress pathway by assessing changes in ATF6 and
XBP-1 transcriptional activity. XBP-1 mRNA is increased by
ATF6 and spliced by IRE1 in response to ER stress, resulting
in production of a transcription factor that can induce genes
associated with the UPR (28). QT-PCR analysis showed that
the induction of ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA occurs in
response to Pim inhibitor treatment (Fig. 5A). The spliced
version of XBP-1 is seen in this PCR assay as a larger band.
This assay conﬁrmed that SMI-4a treatment of LNCaP cells,
when compared with the Tunicamycin control, is capable of
inducing the splicing of XBP-1 in a dose-dependent fashion
(Fig. 5B). Pim inhibitor-induced splicing was seen in PC-3,
Du145, and C4–2B cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7A–C).
Moreover, we found that SMI-4a did not increase XBP-1
splicing in MEFs lacking all Pim isoforms (TKO) MEF cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7D) and knockdown of Pims in LNCaP
cells with shRNAs decreased the ability of Pim inhibitors to
cause XBP-1 splicing (Supplementary Fig. S7E). Activation of
XBP-1 is known to lead to transcription of glucose-regulated
protein 78 (grp78/BiP) and its splice variant grp78va. We
found that both grp78/Bip and grp78va transcripts were
signiﬁcantly increased by treatment of LNCaP cells with
SMI-4a or K00135 (Fig. 5C). This data show that inhibition of
Pim kinase pathways is sufﬁcient to activate a second arm of
the UPR response.

Synergy between Pim Kinase Inhibitor and ABT-737

SMI-4a, or 10 mmol/L K00135 for 16 hours. Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies shown. B, LNCaP cells were treated DMSO or SMI4a for 16 hours. Aliquots of cell extracts were subjected to IP with Mcl-1 antibody and then immunoblot (IB) probed with Mcl-1 and Noxa antibodies. C, LNCaP
cells were treated with 10 mmol/L SMI-4a for 0, 4, or 16 hours. Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies shown. D, LNCaP cells were
treated with various doses of SMI-4a (4a) for 16 hours. Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies shown. E, LNCaP cells were treated with
Pim inhibitors at the indicated doses for 16 hours. Tunicamycin (Tm) and Thapsigargin (Tg) were used as controls. Cells were treated with 10058-F4, which is of
the same chemotype as SMI-4a and is an active Pim inhibitor. Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies shown.

Combination treatment of Pim inhibitor SMI-4a and
ABT-737 inhibits tumor growth in vivo
Given the synergy of Pim inhibitors and ABT-737 in cell
culture, we sought to examine anticancer efﬁcacy of the
combination treatment in vivo through a tumor xenograft
model. Mice bearing LNCaP prostate tumors were treated
with either ABT-737, SMI-4a, or a combination of both agents.
Although neither individual drug treatment showed a difference from vehicle control, the combination treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth (Fig. 6A). Immunohistochimical staining of tumor tissues revealed that SMI-4a treatment
markedly downregulated Mcl-1 expression (Fig. 6B) and ABT737 increased the levels of this protein, as previously shown by
others (17) whereas combination therapy seemed to increase
cleaved caspase-3. In tumor samples, Western blot analysis
showed that combination therapy with SMI-4a and ABT-737
decreased Mcl-1 and increased Noxa and was associated with
increased levels of the apoptosis marker caspase-3 cleavages
(Fig. 6C). Using PCR, we showed that SMI-4a treatment
increased XBP-1 splicing in tumors (Fig. 6D), but this effect
was not seen in the combination therapy. These in vivo results
support the idea that a Pim inhibitor can be safely synergistically combined with ABT-737.

Discussion
Here, we show that Pim kinase inhibitors of varied chemical
structure can be combined with the Bcl-2 family antagonist

ABT-737 to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and
overcome cell death resistance caused by heightened expression of Bcl-2 protein. Resistance to ABT-737 in several tumor
types (16, 17, 21) has been well documented to involve overexpression of the Mcl-1 protein. ABT-737 does not bind with
high afﬁnity to Mcl-1, so it cannot block Mcl-1's activity (29).
Inducing changes in either the Noxa protein, Mcl-1, or both has
been shown to induce the death of multiple tumor cell types
(30) when incubated with ABT-737. For example, treatment
with gemcitabine, a chemotherapeutic agent, increased the
degradation of Mcl-1 and sensitized lung cancer cells to ABT737 (31). In addition, combining ABT-737 with bortezomib, a
proteasome inhibitor known to increase Noxa levels, inhibited
the growth of lymphoma cells (32), and actinomycin D treatment of tumor cells enhanced the efﬁcacy of ABT-737 action by
downmodulating Mcl-1 expression (33). Prostate cancer cell
lines express heightened levels of Mcl-1 making them resistant
to the action of ABT-737 (21). However, we showed that the
addition of the Pim inhibitors both decreased the cellular levels
of the Mcl-1 protein and raised the level of the BH3 protein
Noxa, a highly speciﬁc inhibitor of the Mcl-1 protein (34),
markedly enhancing the activity of ABT-737. Previously, the
application of a different Pim inhibitor, SGI-1776, to leukemic
cells has been shown to decrease the levels of Mcl-1, although
the mechanism was not identiﬁed (35).
Mcl-1 protein levels can be regulated by transcriptional,
translational, and posttranslational mechanisms sensitize cells
to ABT-737–induced death. Because the Mcl-1 protein has a

B, LNCaP cells were treated with SMI-4a (4a), 10058-F4 (F4) or Tunicamycin (Tm) at the indicated doses for 16 hours. Total RNA was isolated and then

short half-life, inhibitors that disturb protein synthesis, and
in particular 50 cap driven translation, have the potential to
decrease the cellular level of this protein (35, 36). For
example, inhibition of glucose transport blocks AKT activity,
inhibits the mTORC1 pathway, downregulates Mcl-1 translation and sensitizes lymphoma cells to ABT-737 treatment
(37). Similarly, in other contexts, mTORC1 has been shown
to be responsible for Mcl-1 protein levels (35). We ﬁnd in
prostate cancer cells that incubation with Pim inhibitors or
knock down of Pim protein levels enhances the phosphorylation of 4E-BP-1 and as a result increases the binding of
4E-BP1 with eIF-4E inhibiting mTORC1 activity. We hypothesize that Pim inhibitors block the mTORC1 pathway based
on their activation of AMPK, which we have shown plays a
key role in ﬁbroblasts in mediating the ability of Pim
inhibitors to curtail protein synthesis (12). The ability of
Pim kinases to modulate mTORC1 activity has been shown
in lymphoma cell lines (10, 38), leukemic cells (11), and
normal ﬁbroblasts (12). Similar ﬁndings have been identiﬁed
in other cell systems. For example, when glucose is withdrawn or 2-deoxyglucose applied to leukemic cells increases
in AMPK activity (39), inhibition of mTOR activity, and
decreases in the levels of Mcl-1 protein (40) are seen.
Activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase leads to phosphorylation of both the raptor and TSC-2 proteins to block
mTORC1 activity (41). The mechanism by which Pim kinases
regulate AMPK is not clear, but in ﬁbroblasts the absence of
Pim kinases causes increases in the amount of cellular AMP
and a drop in ATP levels secondary to regulation of mitochondrial metabolism (12). Application of the Pim inhibitor,
SMI-4a, to Bcr-Abl positive K562 cells induces identical
biologic effects (10).

We found that the application of Pim kinase inhibitors to
prostate cancer cells also decreases the half-life of the Mcl-1
protein, an effect that is reversed by the addition of proteasome
inhibitors. A number of mechanisms could explain this ﬁnding.
The E3 ligase b-TrCP stimulates the degradation of Mcl-1,
which has been phosphorylated by activated GSK-3b (42). GSK3b activity is increased by agents that inhibit AKT such as by
the withdrawal of growth factors like IL-3 (43). Preliminary
data (unpublished results) suggests that Pim kinase inhibitors
can block growth factor signaling mimicking the effects of
growth factor withdrawal. Mcl-1 levels are also controlled by an
interaction with Mule/ARF-BP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (44) and
this interaction can be modulated by, for example, heat shock
(45). Pim kinase inhibitors by blocking mitochondrial metabolism could "stress" prostate cancer cells leading to protein
degradation through a Mule/ARF-BP1 mechanism. Finally, the
interaction of the Mcl-1 and its speciﬁc deubiquitinase USP9X
is highly regulated (31, 46), and it is possible Pim kinases and
their inhibitors could modulate this process, as well.
We show for the ﬁrst time that a genetically engineered
decrease in Pim kinase levels or the addition of Pim kinase
inhibitors causes ER stress and activates the unfolded protein
response (UPR) stimulating increases in eIF-2a phosphorylation, ATF4, CHOP proteins, cleavage of XBP-1, and increases in
the Noxa protein. Although the Noxa protein was initially
cloned as a p53 activated gene (47), it can be elevated transcriptionally in the absence of p53 by increases in both FoxO1
(48) and c-Myc (49). Recently, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was reported to activate the UPR and stimulate the
formation of an ATF3 and ATF4 complex that enhances Noxa
mRNA synthesis (26, 27). Previously, apoptosis and the UPR
were connected by the observation that BAX and BAK were

Synergy between Pim Kinase Inhibitor and ABT-737

Figure 6. Tumor growth in vivo is inhibited by combination treatment of ABT-737 and SMI-4a. A, mice were subcutaneously inoculated with LNCaP cells. Tumor
volume was monitored during the following treatments: vehicle (V), ABT-737 (ABT; 50 mg/kg; i.p., QD), SMI-4a (4a; 60 mg/kg, oral gavage, BID) or a
combination of SMI-4a and ABT-737 (ABT plus 4a) for 16 days (mean  SEM). B, immunohistochemical analysis of Mcl-1, cleaved caspase-3 (casp-3) and
H&E staining. C, Western blot analysis of Noxa, Mcl-1, cleaved casp-3, b-actin, and glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Five
representative tumors for each treatment were examined. D, qT-PCR analysis of XBP-1 splicing in subcutaneous tumors of treatment groups. Five
representative tumors for each treatment group are shown. E, proposed mechanistic model by which Pim inhibitor synergizes with ABT-737 to induce
apoptosis. Pim inhibitors reduce Mcl-1 protein translation through activation of AMPK to block the mTORC1-mediated 50 cap-dependent protein translation. In
addition, this treatment activates the UPR signaling to induce Noxa, thereby promoting increased Mcl-1 turnover.

needed to induce the UPR by inositol-requiring-enzyme 1a
(IRE-1a; ref. 50). IRE-1a executes site-speciﬁc cleavage of XBP1 mRNA to produce more stable transcript XBP-1 that encodes
a potent transcriptional activator of UPR target genes (28).
Dose dependent increases in XBP-1 splicing by Pim inhibitors
conﬁrm our ﬁnding that Pim inhibition drives cells to activate
ER stress. Compared with wild MEF cells, XBP-1 splicing was
not increased in Pim knock-out (TKO) MEF cells, suggesting
again the potential role of Pim in regulating this pathway.
Additional experiments will be necessary to determine the
exact biochemical mechanism by which inhibition of the Pim
kinases modulates the UPR.
On the basis of the cell culture ﬁndings that inhibition of Pim
with SMI-4a increases Noxa and decreases Mcl-1 protein levels
greatly enhancing the apoptotic activity of ABT-737, we combined these agents in an in vivo animal experiment. Results
show that single agent therapy had little anticancer activity
whereas combination treatment inhibited the growth of
LNCaP cells grown subcutaneously. Immunohistochemistry
and Western blots show that this combined therapy activates
the UPR and induces apoptosis of these tumor cells (Fig. 6). On
the basis of their ability to regulate protein synthesis and the

UPR (see model Fig. 6E), these results suggest that Pim kinase
inhibitors could be used in the clinic to enhance the anticancer
activity of ABT-737.
