ABSTRACT
Uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7, as one of significant
drug enzymes, is responsible on the glucuronidation of abundant endobiotics or
xenobiotics. We here report that it is markedly repressed in the tumor tissues of
colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients. Accordingly, morphine in CRC cells will stimulate
the expression of its main metabolic enzyme, UGT2B7 during tolerance generation
by activating the positive signals in histone 3, especially for trimethylated lysine 27
(H3K4Me3) and acetylated lysine 4 (H3K27Ac). Further study reveals that brainderived neutrophilic factor (BDNF), a secretory neurotrophin, enriched in CRC can
interact and inhibit UGT2B7 by primarily blocking the positive signals of H3K4Me3
as well as activating H3K27Ac on the promoter region of UGT2B7. Meanwhile, BDNF
repression attributes to the sensitizations of main core factors in poly-comb repressive
complex (PRC) 1 rather than PRC2 as the reason of the depression of SUZ12 in the
later complex. Besides that, the productions of two main morphine glucuronides
are both increased in the BDNF deficient or TSA and BIX-01294 treated morphine
tolerance-like HCT-116 cells. On the same condition, active metabolite, morphine-6glucuronide (M6G) was accumulated more than inactive M3G. Our findings imply that
enzymatic activity enhancement and substrate regioselective catalysis alteration of
UGT2B7 may release morphine tolerance under the cure of tumor-induced pain.

In human body, morphine is metabolized mainly in the
liver, but it can still be reabsorbed and metabolized in
the colorectum [4]. It is worth to mention that one of
its glucuronide metabolites, morphine-6-glucuronide
(M6G), which is catalyzed by uridine diphosphateglucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7), performs more
analgesic effects than morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) or

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) may induce drastic
pain inevitably. To release the tumor-induced pain, opioid
potent drug, morphine would be primarily used though it
may approach to severe side-effects such as dependence,
opioid-dependent hyperalgesia (OIH) or tolerance [1–3].

morphine prototype [5]. After treated with the same doses
of morphine and M6G, tolerant mice need expose more of
the later one to recover the initial status [6]. Interestingly,
M3G can prevent from M6G-medaited tolerance by
blocking its antinociceptive effect [6, 7]. Those facts
support both M3G and M6G would be significant in
morphine tumor analgesia induced tolerance.
Recent research illustrates the expression of UGTs can
be regulated under epigenetic changes or posttranslational
modifications, such as DNA hyper methylation, aberrant
histone modification and phosphorylation. Some of those
regulations can selectively transform the catalyzing
activities to their substrates [8–10]. For example, DNA
hyper methylations mediated UGT1A1 regression would
contribute to irinotecan active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) inactivation and cytotoxicity
increase in human CRC cells. Meanwhile, combining
usage of the inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)
or histone deacetylase (HDAC) including 2'-deoxy-5azacytidine (DAC) and trichostatin A (TSA) can reverse
this reaction [11]. Accordingly, our preliminary data show
that UGT2B7 depressed in CRC. Thus, whether epigenetic
variants of UGT2B7 can induce aberrant morphine
glucuronidation became a hypothesis in our research.
As preserving the survival of several populations
of central neurons [12, 13], brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) now has been discovered with much
higher expression level in colorectal carcinoma tissues
[14, 15]. Many clues elucidate it has a tight connection
to morphine antinociception. Chronic morphine explosion
can dominantly enrich the negative or silencing signal,
trimethylated lysine 27 in histone 3 (H3K27Me3), on the
promoter of BDNF at mice ventral tegmental area (VTA)
region [16], then down-regulate nuclear receptor related-1
(NURR1) expression [17]. Moreover, knocking BDNF out
in the microglia of gene-targeted mice is able to preserve
Cl (-) homeostasis and not to develop hyperalgesia during
morphine treatment [18]. Similarly, suppressive effect of it
will enhance the ability of morphine to increase dopamine
(DA) neuron excitability and promote euphoria of mice.
All these prove BDNF should be a negative modulator
of morphine action [19]. However, very little is known
about the relationship between BDNF enrichment and
UGT2B7 suppression in CRC. To address these questions
and explore the mechanism behind the phenomena series
of assays were designed and performed.

adjacent normal tissues (Figure 1A, Figure 1B). After
measuring the differences presented by each pair of
tissues, three of them (Tissue No.2, No. 7 and No.16) were
selected for further investigation. Immunohistochemistry
and blotting images reflected a same trend as mRNA
expression (Figure 1C, Figure 1D). Based on the statistical
differences (P value<0.0005 and P value>0.001) of
patients, we divided each pair of tissues into two groups,
and classified by age, gender, tumor location and tumor
style (Table 1). In order to make a further demonstration,
several CRC cell lines including HCT-116, HCT-15, HT29, Caco-2, LoVo, SW480, SW620 were cultivated to
examine UGT2B7 expression. NCM460, one of normal
human colorectal cell lines, was used as positive control.
Results indicated that the protein expression of UGT2B7
was much higher in normal colorectal cells than tumor
ones (Figure 1E). In this way, we concluded UGT2B7 was
repressing during CRC development.

Histone methyltransferase G9A and HDAC
inhibitors mediate UGT2B7 up-regulation in
CRC cells
To identify whether the variants of methylated or
acetylated signals in histone 3 on the promoter region
of UGT2B7 may join in this phenomenon, two histone
transferase inhibitors, BIX-01294 and TSA, were applied
in three different CRC cell lines, HCT-116, HCT-15 as
well as SW620. After treated with BIX-01294 (1-10μM)
or TSA (10-100 nM) for 72h, the total RNA was extracted
and then reverse transcribed. The expression of UGT2B7
was then measured by qPCR. From the data, UGT2B7 was
significantly activated in each cell line (Figure 2A-2F).
The induction folds for both inhibitors in HCT-116 cells
were extremely higher than the others. Those manifested
methylated and acetylated signals in histone 3 on the
promoter of UGT2B7 were repressed in CRC.

Morphine tolerance induces positive methylated
and acetylated signals in histone 3 on the
promoter of UGT2B7
To identify whether morphine can involve in the
regulations of UGT2B7 during tolerance in CRC. HCT116 cells were chosen and treated with 1μM morphine
for 48h. The μ opioid receptor (MOR) expression was
significantly declined (Figure 3A, Figure 3B). Thus,
morphine tolerance-like cell models were established [20,
21]. As soon as it was generated, we checked that UGT2B7
was simultaneously activated (Figure 3C, Figure 3D). To
determine whether this phenomenon was correlated to the
activation of positive signals in histone 3 during morphine
tolerance, we investigated each of them on UGT2B7's
promoter region via chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP)-qPCR assay. In brief, the primers containing five
fragments distributed in 2000 base pairs (bp) of UGT2B7
upstream promoter region were designed and synthesized

RESULTS
UGT2B7 specific depresses in CRC
We primary determined the UGT2B7 expression in
45 pairs of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in CRC
patients (Supplementary Table 1). Consistent with the
data analyzed by SYBR-Green quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR), UGT2B7 mRNA expression
was significantly declined in tumor tissues compared to

(Figure 3E, Supplementary Table 2). One of them with
the sequence of -1707 to -1544 base pairs (bp) can be
amplified so that it was applied for further tests. From
the results, we noticed the positive methylated signals
in histone 3 including H3K4Me2, H3K4Me3 were all
receded in HCT-116 compared to normal colorectal cells,
but rebounded in morphine tolerance (Figure 3F). Similar
trends were also performed in integral positive signal,
acetylated in histone 3 (H3Ac), including some specific
ones: H3K9Ac, H3K18Ac and H3K27Ac. Among all of
those, H3K4Me3 and H3K27Ac became the two signals
with the biggest changes which attributed to 6- or 24- fold
increases respectively in morphine tolerance-like HCT-116
cells than non-treatment control ones.

the different regions of BDNF promoter were designed
and synthesized, then primarily applied in HCT-116
cells (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Figure
1A, Supplementary Figure 1B). From the results, siRNA
(1155) can significantly inhibit the gene and it was chosen
for next assays. After knocking down BDNF in HCT-116
cells (Figure 4A, Figure 4B), UGT2B7 was inversely
motivated (Figure 4C). To analyze whether BDNF could
bind on the promoter of UGT2B7, distal promoter of
the later one from -1757 to -239bp containing with the
sequences previous selected and proximal promoter from
-648 to +132bp were designed and produced by PCR and
inserted into pGL3-basic vector for reporter gene plasmids
establishment (Supplementary Table 2, Figure 4D). Next,
we overexpressed BDNF and transfected with reporter
gene plasmids into HEK293 cells, luciferase assay was
performed to determine this transactivation. From the data,
we found BDNF can specifically interact with the promoter
of UGT2B7 (Figure 4E). Using different concentrations
of K252-a which was reported to inhibit BDNF can even
attenuate this interaction (Figure 4F) [22].

BDNF binds with UGT2B7 promoter and
attributes to its repression in CRC
We further attempted to know whether BDNF
which overexpresses in CRC is related to the regression
of UGT2B7. Three siRNA (1155, 1314, 1768) targeted to

alter the signals of H3K4Me3 and H3K27Ac on
the promoter of UGT2B7

protein-protein interaction (PPI), this binding even existed
in morphine tolerance-like CRC cells (Figure 5A, Figure
5B). Interestingly, under the same condition, knocking
down BDNF can further; contribute to H3K4Me3
activation and H3K27Ac suppression. Considering
BDNF was opposite to UGT2B7 expression, this finding
indicated H3K4Me3 should be the main signal to stimulate
UGT2B7 after BDNF was knockdown (Figure 5C).

After that, we conservatively hypothesized this
interaction for BDNF and UGT2B7 may generate
in the proteins. To verify that, ChIP-qPCR and coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay were carried out.

factors of PRC1 significant upregulation, but SUZ12 of
PRC2 was in a converse character (Figure 6A, Figure 6B).

Since H3K27Ac was alleviated on the promoter
region of UGT2B7 when BDNF was knockdown in
morphine tolerance CRC cells, the expression of the
factors correlated to this signal such as poly-comb
repressive complex (PRC) 1 or PRC2 attracted our
interests for deep exploration. We examined the expression
of the main core factors in PRC2, including EZH2
and SUZ12 as well as the main core factors in PRC1
containing with BMl1, CMX4 and Ring1B during BDNF
recession in morphine tolerance-like HCT-116 cells. Then
we found BDNF repression contributed to three core

To determine the role of SUZ12 in BDNF mediated
UGT2B7 regulation, SUZ12 was overexpressed in
HCT-116 cells (Figure 6C, Figure 6D). Preliminary, we
measured the expression of UGT2B7 and BDNF then
found BDNF was activated in the opposite, UGT2B7 was
slightly decreased (Figure 6E, Figure 6F). Meanwhile,
we noticed the reason for this phenomenon was due to

later one was able to bind with the promoter of UGT2B7
(Figure 6H). Overexpressing BDNF can enhance this
transactivation (Figure 6I). Consequences of ChIP-qPCR
assay illustrated that morphine tolerance had no impacts
on these regulations (Figure 6J). Besides, the signal of
H3K27Ac on the promoter of UGT2B7 significantly
receded after SUZ12 overexpressing in BDNF depressed
morphine tolerance-like HCT-116 cells (Figure 6K). All
the results presented when morphine tolerance generated
in CRC, PRC2 core factor, SUZ12 enrichment and BDNF
disrupting would contribute to an opposite change for
H3K4Me3 or H3K27Ac on the promoter of UGT2B7.

Supplementary Table 3). After that, we determined the
quantities of M3G and M6G under epigenetic inhibitors
BIX-01294 (5μM) and TSA (50 nM) treatment or BDNF
deficient morphine tolerance-like HCT-116 cells by
HPLC-MS/MS. Knocking down UGT2B7 was conducted
as a negative control. Based on the data, we found the
enzymatic activities of UGT2B7 were all increased after
HDAC, G9A inhibitors or siRNA (BDNF) treatment
(Figure 7A, Figure 7B). In contrast, the quantity ratio of
M3G to M6G dropped off compared to the control group
(Table 2), which means M6G selectively produced after
the fortification of UGT2B7 enzymatic activity.

DISCUSSION
UGT2B7 is one of the main metabolism enzymes
to catalyze many endogenous compounds such as retinoic
acid, estriol and exogenous drugs including anti-tumor
zidovudine (AZT) and epirubicin [23]. Here, we detected
that it significantly repressed in the tumor tissues of CRC
patients due to the cell factors mediated alterations of
positive methylated or acetylated signals in histone 3, as
seen in Figure 8. Two positive signals including H3K4Me3
and H3K27Ac had significantly upregulated from

To acknowledge whether these mechanisms can
change the enzymatic activity or substrate regioslective
catalysis of UGT2B7, morphine glucuronidation assay
was then performed in vitro. Firstly, siRNA-621 specific
targeted to UGT2B7 was verified previously [21] and
applied to the next tests (the sequences were shown in

depression on the promoter of UGT2B7 during morphine
tolerance. Accordingly, BDNF, PRC1 and PRC2 were
also involved in the UGT2B7 activation. The purpose
of this study was to determine whether this mechanism
can finally transform the enzymatic activity of UGT2B7
then affect morphine regioselective glucuronidation, our
conclusion may guide for morphine application in tumorinduced pain.
The microarray data of adjacent normal and tumor
tissues from CRC patients elucidate that the depression
differences of UGTB7 can be divided to high (P<0.0005)
or low (P>0.001) significant difference groups. Age,
gender, tumor location and tumor style are obviously
correlated to these differences. According to the
information, we found age would be a main element in
the high difference group. The number of people in under
70-year-old group which featured with higher UGT2B7
expression differences was 10 times more than those

over 70. Many clues indicate its expression is persistently
raising from childhood to adolescence but significantly
decreasing after 20 age-old [24, 25]. This phenomenon
may give us an explanation why younger CRC patients
held higher expression level of UGT2B7 in their normal
colorectal tissues compared to the tumor ones.
Gradient concentrations of TSA (10-100 nM) and
BIX-01294 (1-10μM) were administrated into three
CRC cell lines. We found the expression of UGT2B7
was significantly activated in the cells which were treated
with either of the chemical compounds. Here, these two
candidate compounds used in our tests are potential drugs
to remedy colorectal cancer, although they have not been
approved to come into the market [26, 27]. As regular
HDACs inhibitor, TSA is used for target gene revitalization
by altering its histone acylation signals on its promoter and
performs therapeutic effect in tumors. For instance, it can
elevate the oxaliplatin renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cure

sensitization during combination usage by upregulating
organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) expression [28].
Accordingly, BIX-01294 can prohibit euchromatic histonelysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2, G9A) and G9A-like
proteins then impair the transformations for methylated
signals of lysis 4 or 9 on the promoter of target genes in
histone 3 [29, 30]. Also, it can release the proliferation
and tumorigenicity of cancer cells by leading to G9A
inactivation [31]. Interestingly, H3K4Me2 regulated by
human histone demethylase LSD2 plays a contrary role
to H3K9Me2. So BIX-01294 can be applied for changing
the former signal, H3K4Me2 which is correlated to the
stable complex of G9A and LSD2 [32]. Besides, it once
reported that this chemical compound reduces the signal of
H3K4Me3 following by concentration- and time-dependent
manner in malaria parasite [33]. For these reasons, in order
to further acknowledge the functions of TSA and BIX01294, we then checked some of the positive methylated or
acetylated signals in histone 3 on the promoter of UGT2B7
in normal or CRC cell lines. Results indicated the signals of
H3K4Me2, H3K4Me3 or H3K9Ac, H3K18Ac, H3K27Ac
have significantly depressed in CRC compared to the normal

cells. Their reductions would become one vital reason for
UGT2B7 silencing in CRC.
Some substrates of UGT2B7 can even raise the
enzyme gene expression such as zidovudine [34]. Similarly,
morphine can upregulate its expression not only in CRC
but also in the normal human liver cells [21]. Based on our
results, the variants of positive acetylated or methylated
signals in histone 3 on the promoter of UGT2B7 also
involved in this activation. On the other hand, we were also
focusing on the two prominent signals including H3K4Me3
and H3K27Ac which have 6- or 24-fold change respectively
in morphine tolerance-like HCT-116 cells comparing to
non-morphine treatment control group. At the same time,
Knocking down BDNF decreased H3K27Ac signal but made
H3K4Me3 ascending, which illustrates BDNF recession
mediated UGT2B7 activation was mainly dependent on the
enrichment of H3K4Me3. Since overexpressing of BDNF
will repress G9A activity, besides, G9A can pass negative
feedbacks to the signal of H3K4Me3, so that the above
conclusion could be effectively explained [35, 36].
It is worth mentioning that H3K27Ac develops
a different character on the same gene promoter region

compared to H3K27Me3, the later signal which can
specifically make PRC2 recruitment [37]. At the same time,
PRC1 is correlated to the ubiquitination signal of histone
2A lysine 119 (H2AK119U1), which appears together with
H3K27Me3 [38]. Recent research reflected core factor
CBX of PRC1 participates in the recruitment mediated by
the signal variants of H3K27Me3, which is namely to say
that both PRC1 and PRC2 would be correlated to the signal
variants of H3K27Me3 and H3K27Ac [39, 40]. In addition,
the expressions of core factors were all significantly
increased excepting from SUZ12 in PRC2 after knocking
down BDNF during morphine tolerance in CRC. Meanwhile,
SUZ12 could involve in BDNF mediated UGT2B7 silencing
in CRC via further blocking the signals of H3K27Ac and
increasing H3K4Me3. Since BDNF and SUZ12 can interact
in the protein level based on our data, which implied both
of them would be mutually enriched on the promoter of
UGT2B7 and spur the gene target as the form of complex.
BDNF mediated the variants of decorating signals in
histone 3 not only changes UGT2B7 expression, but also
impacts its enzymatic activity and morphine regioselective
glucuronidation. We discovered knocking down UGT2B7 in
morphine tolerance-like HCT-116 cells, the productions of
3- or 6-site morphine glucuronides were decreased by 22.9%
or 35.9% respectively compared to NC siRNA transfected
control group. In contrast, they were overwhelmingly
boosted during UGT2B7 activation, which shows that the
role of BDNF is extremely remarkable, compared to the
group of histone kinase inhibitors treatment. Our previous
research indicated lithocholic acid (LCA) regulated
UGT2B7 repression performs the same change to morphine
glucuronidation in human liver cells as the production of
M3G decreases less than M6G [21]. Besides, epirubicin
can activate UGT2B7 and contribute to an increase of M6G
more than M3G [41]. These reports all potently supported
what we have recognized. As a consequence, along with
the quantifications of two main metabolites, inducing or
repressing of UGT2B7 performed regioselective catalysis
to morphine.
In summary, we identified the role of BDNF in the
variants of positive signals of methylated or acetylated in
histone 3 on the promoter of UGT2B7 under morphine
tolerance in vitro. The conclusions reveal that when
morphine tolerance happens in CRC, inhibiting UGT2B7
expression would be beneficial to its tolerance reverse by
significantly declining the productions of M6G comparing
to M3G. These mechanisms may guide the morphine
treatment in colorectal carcinoma-induced pain.

Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis of UGT2B7 differential transcriptions
in adjacent normal and tumor tissues of CRC patients were
applied with unpaired student t test. Other statistics data
were expressed as mean ± SEM derived from 3 or 12
paralleled independent studies and counted by the software
of GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, USA). Western blotting was performed in siRNA
selection assay which targeted to BDNF and normalized
to Intensity of optical density (IOD) values of GAPDH
in each group, we used Image Pro Plus 6.0 software to
determine each stripe's IOD value in the blots. We also
used statistics of one-way or two-way ANOVA test as well
as unpaired student t test to estimate the P values in each
difference of integral experiments.
