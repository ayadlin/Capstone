ABSTRACT
The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a key tumor suppressor which has emerged
as a novel molecular target in some human cancers. Here, we show that PP2A
inhibition is a common event in breast cancer and identified PP2A phosphorylation
and deregulation SET and CIP2A as molecular contributing mechanisms to inactivate
PP2A. Interestingly, restoration of PP2A activity after FTY720 treatment reduced cell
growth, induced apoptosis and decreased AKT and ERK activation. Moreover, FTY720
led to PP2A activation then enhancing doxorubicin-induced antitumor effects both
in vitro and in vivo. PP2A inhibition (CPscore: PP2A phosphorylation and/or CIP2A
overexpression) was detected in 27% of cases (62/230), and associated with grade
(p = 0.017), relapse (p < 0.001), negative estrogen (p < 0.001) and progesterone
receptor expression (p < 0.001), HER2-positive tumors (p = 0.049), Ki-67 expression
(p < 0.001), and higher AKT (p < 0.001) and ERK (p < 0.001) phosphorylation.
Moreover, PP2A inhibition determined shorter overall (p = 0.006) and event-free
survival (p = 0.003), and multivariate analysis confirmed its independent prognostic
impact. Altogether, our results indicate that PP2A is frequently inactivated in breast
cancer and determines worse outcome, and its restoration using PP2A activators
represents an alternative therapeutic strategy in this disease.

receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2). Of importance, within this classification,
the triple-negative subtype includes those cases with
worst prognosis and represents a major challenge from a
therapeutic perspective [4]. Therefore, it remains necessary
to improve our knowledge about the molecular bases
that governs breast cancer pathogenesis to develop more
personalized and effective therapies that enhance patient
outcomes and overcome resistance to standard chemotherapy
treatments [5, 6].

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common diagnosed cancer
and accounts for the majority of cancer-related deaths in
women worldwide [1]. This is a very heterogeneous disease
at both molecular and clinical levels and the conventional
histopathological TNM staging criteria is still used to
predict prognosis [2, 3]. Actually, breast cancer classification
discriminates five different tumor subtypes and a normal
breast-like group based on an immunohistochemical criteria
that includes expression of estrogen (ER) and progesterone

high relevance in human cancer [7–9]. Several different
molecular mechanisms to inhibit PP2A have been described
in cancer cells including alterations in PP2A subunits or
deregulation of endogenous PP2A inhibitors such as SET
and CIP2A [10, 11]. Interestingly, downregulation and low
prevalent inactivating mutations affecting PP2A have been
previously reported in breast cancer [12–15]. In addition,
although the role of SET in breast cancer remains mostly
unknown, it has been described high SET levels and low
PP2A activity in the MCF-7 cell line [16], and the work
by Switzer et al. [17] showed that COG112-mediated
SET inhibition in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
reduced AKT signaling and cell proliferation, indicating
that SET could serve as a novel therapeutic target in
these cancers. Furthermore, CIP2A has been reported to
be associated with breast cancer aggressivity [18] and to
modulate sensitivity of breast cancer cells to bortezomib
and doxorubicin treatments [19, 20]. Moreover, it has
been recently reported that CIP2A deficient mice are
resistant to mammary tumorigenesis, the existence of a
positive feedback loop involving CIP2A and E2F1 which
defines senescence sensitivity of breast cancer cells [21],
and the CIP2A modulation of mTORC1 and authophagy
in this disease [22]. In this study, we show that PP2A is
commonly inactivated in breast cancer and identify that
CIP2A and SET overexpression together with PP2A
hyperphosphorylation are key contributing mechanisms to
inhibit PP2A in this disease. Of importance, we show that
FTY720 treatment activates PP2A through decreasing its
phosphorylation and CIP2A expression and then reduces
cell growth and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis.
Moreover, FTY720-induced PP2A activation led to
changes in AKT and ERK activation status and potentiates
doxorubicin antitumor effects in both parental and
mammosphere-derived breast cancer cells. To determine
its clinical relevance, we quantified SET, CIP2A and
PP2A phosphorylation in a series of 230 breast cancer
patients, observing that PP2A inhibition is a recurrent
molecular event that determines shorter overall and eventfree survival. Interestingly, our results highlight that the
use of PP2A activators alone or in combination with drugs
such as doxorubicin could be a promising therapeutic
alternative for treating an important subgroup of breast
cancer patients.

on PP2A tyrosine-307 together with the expression of
the endogenous PP2A inhibitors SET and CIP2A. Of
importance, it has been reported that PP2Ac is inactive
when tyrosine-307 is phosphorylated [23]. In concordance
with the results showed by the PP2A activity assays, we
found PP2A hyperphosphorylated together with SET and
CIP2A markedly overexpressed in all the breast cancer
cell lines analyzed (Figure 1B). To confirm their PP2A
inhibitory function, CIP2A and SET depletion experiments
were carried out in MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 cells,
observing that both CIP2A and SET silencing led to an
increased PP2A activity (Figure S1A, Figure S1B and
Figure S1C). Altogether, these results would suggest that
PP2A inhibition is a relevant alteration in breast cancer and
indicate the simultaneous cooperation of several distinct
molecular mechanisms to inhibit PP2A in this disease.

PP2A activation by FTY720 reduces cell viability
in breast cancer
To clarify the biologic relevance of PP2A
deregulation in breast cancer cells, we assessed whether an
increase of PP2A activity could affect their cell viability.
Thus, we treated the MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 cell lines
with the PP2A activator FTY720 or vehicle (DMSO).
These cell lines were chosen based on their CIP2A and
SET overexpression levels (Figure 1B) and because they
represent aggressive breast cancer phenotypes (MDAMB-231: triple negative; BT-474: HER-2). However, all
the 5 breast cancer cell lines analyzed showed similar
sensitivity to FTY720 treatment (IC50 range from 2.9 to
8.5 μM; MDA-MB-231: 2.9 μM; BT-474: 8.5 μM; MCF7: 5.3 μM; SK-BR-3: 3.9 μM; MDA-MB-468: 4.1 μM).
Furthermore, quantification of PP2A activity by
phosphatase assays confirmed that FTY720 led to PP2A
activation in both MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 cell lines,
observing around 1.5-fold increase in the PP2A activity
(Figure 2A). As a control, we pretreated MDA-MB-231 and
BT-474 cells with the PP2A inhibitor OA for 90 minutes,
followed by incubation with FTY720 or vehicle for
24 hours. OA was used at a concentration that inhibits PP2A
but no other phosphatases [24], observing that FTY720induced PP2A activity was inhibited by OA (Figure 2A).
To evaluate whether FTY720 is a specific PP2A activator
we quantified PP2A and PP1 activities in MDA-MB-231
and BT-474 cells after FTY720 treatment, observing that
FTY720 was able to increase only PP2A activity. To confirm
that OA is a specific PP2A inhibitor at this concentration,
similar experiments were carried out (Figure S2).
To further investigate the biologic effect of the
FTY720-induced PP2A activation in breast cancer, we
assessed apoptosis measuring activity levels of caspase 3
and 7. In concordance with its ability to activate PP2A
and decrease cell viability FTY720 induced caspasedependent apoptosis, increasing caspase activity levels
more than 5-fold in both MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 cells

RESULTS
Different PP2A activation levels occurs in
breast cancer
We first analyzed the PP2A activation status in five
cell lines representative of the different subtypes of breast
cancer, observing that all of them showed a significant
reduction of PP2A activity (Figure 1A). In order to
investigate the molecular causes of this PP2A inhibition,
we analyzed PP2A expression and phosphorylation levels

in comparison with vehicle-treated cells. No differences
were found in vehicle-treated cells pretreated with OA.
However, OA markedly reduced FTY720-induced caspase
activity (Figure S3A). Altogether, these results would
indicate that PP2A activation by FTY720 treatment has a
promising therapeutic value in breast cancer cells.

show that FTY720 treatment potentiates doxorubicininduced antitumor effects in breast cancer cells. To further
confirm our hypothesis that PP2A activation sensitizes
to doxorubicin treatment, we performed a genetic PP2A
activation by overexpressing PP2A in MDA-MB-231
and BT-474 cells, observing that doxorubicin showed
significantly enhanced antitumor effects in those cells
ectopically expressing PP2A (Figure S4). Finally, we
analyzed the effect of FTY720 treatment in a MDA-MB231-derived clone with a doxorubicin resistance (in fold
change compared to parental cells) of 1,92. Of importance,
we observed that FTY720 was able to resensitize to
doxorubicin MDA-MB-231 clones with an acquired
resistance to this drug (Figure 3B).
We next evaluated mammosphere formation in BT474 cells, observing that both FTY720 and doxorubicin
decreased mammosphere formation in both number and
size of mammospheres formed. However, the combination
of FTY720 with doxorubicin almost completely abolished
the formation of mammospheres (Figures 3C and S5A).
Of interest, 10-fold lower concentration of both drugs
(1 μM) was used in mammosphere formation assays since
higher concentrations totally impaired mammosphere

PP2A activation by FTY720 enhances antitumor
activity of doxorubicin
Anthracyclines like doxorubicin are among the
chemotherapy drugs used in breast cancer standard
systemic therapy [6]. Interestingly, we found that
doxorubicin-induced antitumor effects in the MDAMB-231 and BT-474 cell lines were markedly enhanced
when cells were treated simultaneously with the PP2A
activator FTY720 (Figure 3A). The microscope images
obtained were in concordance with the results showed
by MTS assays in both cell lines (Figure S3B). ChouTalalay analyses showed that the FTY720/doxorubicin
combination has additive effects in MDA-MB-231 cells
(Combination index [CI] = 0.99), and synergistic effects
in BT-474 cells (CI = 0.87). Altogether, these results

formation (Figure S5B). MDA-MB-231 cells were unable
to form well-defined mammospheres. To further confirm
these results on mammospheres already formed, we next
performed mammosphere formation during 7 days and
then treated well-defined BT-474-derived mammospheres
with vehicle, FTY720 and doxorubicin alone or combined
with FTY720. As expected, we found that FTY720
enhanced doxorubicin-induced antitumor effects which
confirmed our previous findings (Figure S6).
Western blot analysis showed that FTY720
decreased phosphorylation of the PP2A targets AKT
and ERK without affecting their expression (Figure
3C). We observed that PP2A phosphorylation was
negatively affected in FTY720-treated cells compared
with vehicle-treated cells. Moreover, we found reduced
CIP2A levels after FTY720 treatment whereas no changes
were observed in SET expression. As expected, c-MYC
levels decreased in correlation with CIP2A by FTY720
(Figure 3D). We next extracted RNA from MDA-MB-231
and BT-474 cells after treatment with vehicle or FTY720
alone or combined with doxorubicin and quantified
CIP2A and PP2A by real-time PCR. Interestingly, we
show that CIP2A mRNA levels did not change after
FTY720 treatment (Figure S7A), indicating that CIP2A
downregulation is a post-translational event as well as
reduced PP2A phosphorylation since both PP2A mRNA
and protein expression remained without changes
(Figure S7A and Figure 3D). Additionally, we have

analyzed the effect of FTY720 treatment in MDA-MB-231
cells ectopically expressing CIP2A. Interestingly, we
observed that CIP2A overexpression restore basal levels
of c-MYC together with AKT and PP2A phosphorylation
(Figure S7B). Altogether, these results would indicate
that the molecular mechanism of action of FTY720 in
breast cancer cells involves PP2A activation through its
dephosphorylation and CIP2A downregulation together
with inhibition of AKT and ERK signaling.

In vivo evaluation of FTY720 alone and
combined with doxorubicin shows promising
antitumor effects
MDA-MB-231 xenografts were performed to
evaluate in vivo the activity of FTY720 alone or in
combination with doxorubicin. We observed that tumor
growth were significantly reduced by both FTY720
and doxorubicin treatments. Interestingly, FTY720
significantly enhanced doxorubicin-induced antitumor
effects, confirming our previous observations in vitro
(Figure 4A). Tumor specimens collected at the end of the
experiments were analyzed by immunohistochemistry
(Figure 4B). In concordance with our in vitro results,
FTY720 led to reduced CIP2A and p-PP2A expression.
As expected, SET expression was not altered in any of the
treatment regimens of the in vivo xenograft (Figure 4C).
Although the highest effects were shown by the combined

and endothelial cells). SET was exclusively observed in
malignant cells and with a predominantly nuclear location.
High p-PP2A levels were observed in 20% of
cases (46/230), whereas SET and CIP2A were found
overexpressed in 13.5% (31/230) and 17.8% of cases
(41/230) respectively. Of relevance, SET overexpression
was significantly associated and always detected in
combination with high p-PP2A and/or CIP2A (p <
0.001; only 1 out of the 31 SET overexpressed cases
was negative for p-PP2A and CIP2A) (Table S2). In
addition, it was the only PP2A inhibitor marker studied
without significant prognostic value in our cohort (p =
0.085). These observations prompted us to analyze the
PP2A phosphorylation/inhibition status in breast cancer
cells using a “CPscore” in which value 0 was defined
by those breast cancer patients without altered p-PP2A
and CIP2A, value 1 for those ones with high p-PP2A
or CIP2A overexpressed, and value 2 for the subgroup
of breast cancer cases with high p-PP2A and CIP2A

Prevalence of PP2A inhibition in human breast
cancer and its association with molecular and
phenotypic parameters
To investigate the prevalence and clinical
significance of PP2A inhibition, we quantified SET,
CIP2A and phosphorylated PP2A (p-PP2A) expression
in a cohort of 230 patients with early breast cancer mainly
treated with anthracyclin-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
Patient characteristics are presented in Table S1 and
immunohistochemical detections of CIP2A, p-PP2A and SET
are shown in Figure 5A. CIP2A and p-PP2A were expressed
mainly in the cytoplasm of cancerous cells and diffusely
distributed in the tumor. Weak staining was also detected for
both markers in stromal cells (i.e. fibroblasts, lymphocytes

and EFS (HR 1.3; 95% CI, 0.7–2.3; p = 0.003) (Figure 5B
and Figure 5C). Moreover, we correlated CPscore with OS
and EFS in those 99 breast cancer patients who received
adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy from our cohort
of 230 cases. As expected, we observed that high CPscore
was negatively associated with OS (p = 0.074) and EFS
(p  =  0.124). In this case, significance was not achieved
probably due to the lower number of patients included in
this subgroup (Figure S8B). Multivariate Cox analysis
demonstrated that CPscore is an unfavorable independent
factor associated with OS (HR 1.8; 95% confidence interval
(CI), 1.2–2.6; p = 0.004) (Table 2) and EFS (HR 1.8; 95% CI,
1.2–2.7; p = 0.002) (Table S3) in early breast cancer.

associated with tumor grade (p = 0.017), absence of ER
(p < 0.001) and PR expression (p < 0.001), and HER2
amplification (p = 0.049). Importantly, we also found high
CPscore in those patients with higher tumor proliferation
rates measured using Ki-67 (p < 0.001). Finally, we
observed that PP2A phosphorylation/inhibition positively
correlated with higher AKT (p < 0.001) and ERK
(p < 0.001) phosphorylation levels in tumor cells (Figure
S8A). Association between CPscore and molecular and
clinical parameters are included in Table 1.

Clinical follow-up data were available for all the 230
patients included in the study, with a median of age of 58 years
(range: 26–90). Of relevance, high CPscore was found in those
patients who relapsed (p < 0.001). Additionally, the subgroup
of patients with high CPscore showed a substantially shorter

effects of chemotherapy, the patients underwent surgery.
The mean time between the last dose of chemotherapy

apoptosis activation (p < 0.01) after doxorubicin treatment
(Figure S8C). Therefore, these results reinforce our

therapeutic value of FTY720-induced PP2A activation in
combination with doxorubicin in breast cancer.

DISCUSSION
PP2A is a tumor suppressor that regulates signaling
pathways crucial for maintaining tumor cell properties [7–9].
We report here that PP2A inhibition is a frequent event in
breast cancer and identified PP2A hyperphosphorylation
together with SET and CIP2A overexpression as molecular
mechanisms that cooperate to inactivate this phosphatase.
Of importance, restoration of PP2A activity after FTY720
treatment reduced cell viability, induced caspase-dependent
apoptosis and inactivated AKT and ERK by decreasing
their phosphorylation status. We also found that FTY720induced PP2A activation potentiated doxorubicin antitumor
effects in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Moreover, patients with PP2A phosphorylation/inhibition
had significantly worse clinical outcome and multivariate
analysis, suggesting that PP2A phosphorylation/inhibition
has an independent prognostic value for overall and event4307

free survival in breast cancer patients. Therefore, our
results demonstrate that PP2A inhibition is a common event
with a high clinical relevance in breast cancer and that the
use of PP2A activators such as FTY720 has a potential
therapeutic value and could represent an alternative
therapeutic strategy for treating breast cancer patients.
Despite some data in the literature suggest a
potential importance of PP2A inactivation in breast
cancer, its clinical and molecular significance still need to
be fully clarified. Although functional PP2A inactivating
alterations have been previously reported [12–15, 25] their
low prevalence suggests that this is not a key mechanism
to inhibit PP2A. However, the mutational status of PP2A
should be studied to evaluate their potential contribution to
the reduced PP2A activity observed in breast cancer cells.
Thus, we could further clarify whether the observed PP2A
inhibition is the result of SET or CIP2A overexpression or
inhibiting mutations of PP2A. Furthermore, several works
described a potential relevant role of the PP2A inhibitor
CIP2A. Thus, we observed a reduced PP2A activity in all
the five breast cancer cell lines analyzed, identifying PP2A
hyperphosphorylation and SET and CIP2A overexpression
in all cases, which prompted us to hypothesize that these
could be relevant contributing mechanisms to inhibit PP2A
in breast cancer. Interestingly, PP2A mutations were not
found in a recently published work after analyzing 4 breast
cancer cell lines and an additional set of 25 cell lines from
other tumors. Moreover, the authors studied publically
available datasets (cBioPortal) and reported that PP2A
activation status could be deregulated in more than 50% of
basal breast cancer tumors due to alterations affecting PP2A
subunits or deregulation of endogenous PP2A inhibitors
such as SETBP1, SET or CIP2A [26]. However, it has
been reported that SETBP1 binds and protects SET from
the protease cleavage then inhibiting PP2A [27]. Therefore,
it remains necessary to analyze whether SET is proteolyzed
in breast cancer before concluding that SETBP1 could
contribute to PP2A inhibition in this disease.
Reversible methylation of PP2A by leucine carboxyl
methyltransferase 1 (LCMT-1) and protein phosphatase
methylesterase 1 (PME-1) has been reported as a relevant
PP2A regulatory mechanism [28]. However, their status in
breast cancer still remains unexplored and further studies
are needed to clarify the potential relevance of PP2A
methylation in this disease. Furthermore, considering
that the PP2A regulatory subunit is determining both the
substrate and the location of the PP2A complex [9], it
would be very interesting to study the different families of
PP2A regulatory subunits to properly clarify their status
and relevance in breast cancer. Moreover, future studies
evaluating PP2A phosphorylation after knock-down of
SET or CIP2A are warranted to assess their relevance in
regulating PP2A activity in breast cancer.
FTY720 is a FDA-approved immunosuppressor
used in multiple sclerosis treatment, which has shown
promising preclinical effects in several human cancers [10,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

29, 30]. Thus, we evaluate the potential therapeutic value
of PP2A activation using FTY720 to treat breast cancer
cells and observed a significant decrease of cell growth
and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis in both
MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 cells, in concordance with the
FTY720-mediated antitumor properties previously reported
[26, 31, 32]. Importantly, we confirmed by PP2A assays that
those FTY720-mediated effects were dependent on PP2A
activation since pretreatment with the PP2A inhibitor OA
almost totally restored these FTY720 induced effects. The
fact that cell viability was not completely restored when
cells were treated with FTY720 combined with OA is
probably due to an additional FTY720-induced toxicity as
previously reported in other tumor models such as colorectal
cancer or acute myeloid leukemia [11, 30]. Therefore, the
contribution of PP2A to FTY720 biological effects should
be fully clarify in future studies using PP2A siRNAs or
dominant active constructs. These observations are of high
relevance suggesting the potential use of different PP2A
activating drugs for breast cancer treatment [33].
Furthermore, FTY720 has been described to enhance
the effects of sunitinib malate [34] and to increase radiation
sensitivity of breast cancer cells [35]. Doxorubicin is an
anthracycline currently used in breast cancer standard
chemotherapy [6]. Thus, we next evaluated whether FTY720
could modulate doxorubicin sensitivity of breast cancer
cells, observing that doxorubicin-induced antitumor effects
were markedly enhanced after FTY720-induced PP2A
activation. Moreover, we observed that FTY720 was able
to resensitize to doxorubicin MDA-MB-231 clones with an
acquired resistance to this drug. This observation together
with the results obtained by the ex vivo experiments and
the fact that CPscore determined response to neoadjuvant
doxorubicin would indicate that PP2A activation is able to
overcome doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells.
In addition, FTY720 led to reduced p-PP2A and
CIP2A levels then enhancing PP2A activity. Of interest,
CIP2A has been reported to modulate sensitivity of breast
cancer cells to bortezomib and doxorubicin treatments
[19, 20]. These data would indicate that the effect of
FTY720 potentiating sensitivity of breast cancer cell
to doxorubicin is probably via CIP2A downregulation
and suggest a potential enhanced antitumor efficacy of a
combination between FTY720 and bortezomib that should
be explored. Moreover, CIP2A has been reported as a useful
predictive marker of response to vinca alkaloid-containing
chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients
[21]. Unexpectedly, a recent published work reported that
FTY720 decreased sensitivity of SK-BR-3 cells to lapatinib,
a compound used as HER2 targeted therapy in breast
cancer. However, FTY720 was used at 2.5 μM (vs 10 μM
here) during 24 hours and the authors claimed that FTY720
alone did not significantly affect the growth of the SKBR-3 cells (2.5% growth inhibition) [36]. Besides, PP2A
activity assays after FTY720 treatment are missed and one
would expect lower PP2A activation with 2.5 μM than
4308

Oncotarget

with 10 μM. Altogether, further studies to fully clarify the
molecular mechanisms by with FTY720 contributes to the
acquisition of a lapatinib resistant phenotype are warranted.
On the other hand, CIP2A inhibits PP2A-mediated
c-MYC dephosphorylation/degradation [37], and our
results show a correlation between CIP2A and c-MYC
levels after FTY720 treatment. Additionally, CIP2A
signature reveals the c-MYC dependency of CIP2Aregulated phenotypes and its association with breast cancer
subtypes [38]. In concordance with our findings, a recent
work has shown that both CIP2A and SET are frequently
co-overexpressed with c-MYC in breast cancer cell lines
[39]. Treatment with OP449, a novel SET inhibitor,
decreases the tumorigenic potential of breast cancer cells,
and SET inhibition was proposed as the best therapeutic
strategy to activate PP2A – no known inhibitors of CIP2A
have been described – as it could be an antitumor strategy
to post-translationally target c-MYC. In contrast, we
proved that extended inhibition of CIP2A expression,
SET-induced PP2A inhibition and PP2A-phosphorylation
by FTY720 treatment caused a deeply antitumoral effect in
breast cancer cells. FTY720 binds SET and inhibits SETPP2A interaction then leading to PP2A reactivation [40].
However, the drug does not affect SET protein expression
as we observed in this work. Further, we also observed that
FTY720 treatment led to reduced CIP2A expression and
PP2A phosphorylation without changes in mRNA levels
This post-translational FTY720 effect on CIP2A and PP2A
phosphorylation should further be investigated in future
works. Thus, we could better understand why this drug is
a potent PP2A activator and also the potential antagonistic
effects of FTY720 with other compounds as those observed
with lapatinib [36] or SET-binding drugs [41].
The clinical validation in our cohort supports
new therapeutic possibilities in breast cancer patients
for a wide-spectrum drug like FTY720. In addition, we
found reduced phosphorylation of the PP2A targets AKT
and ERK after FTY720 treatment and, interestingly, we
validated these results in a large series of early breast
cancer patients, observing a significant correlation
between PP2A phosphorylation/inhibition through the
CPscore and AKT and ERK phosphorylation levels. Since
SET overexpression was always detected in combination
with high p-PP2A and/or CIP2A (except 1 out of the
31 SET overexpression cases) and had no significant
prognostic value in our cohort, we used a CPscore in
which value 0 was assigned to absence of p-PP2A and
CIP2A, value 1 to high p-PP2A or CIP2A overexpression,
and value 2 to those breast cancer cases with high p-PP2A
and CIP2A overexpression. In fact, it has been reported
higher p-PP2A in later stages of breast cancer progression
and its prognostic value that was not determined [42].
Another study showed CIP2A associated with breast
cancer aggressiveness [18]. PP2A has been previously
reported to positively regulate expression levels of
estrogen receptor alpha (ER) [43] and we observed that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

high CPscore significantly correlated with negative
ER expression in our cohort. Importantly, absence of
ER expression determines poor prognosis and lack of
response to hormonal therapy and it would be indicating
that PP2A inhibition confers poor outcome to breast
cancer patients. Of mention, a recent work described that
estradiol enhances CIP2A expression and showed higher
CIP2A levels in ER-positive tissues than in ER-negative
tissues [44]. These observations are not consistent with
the previous observations by Keen [43] since CIP2A is
a well established PP2A inhibitor. In fact, our results
shows that both CPscore (as mentioned above) (p < 0.001)
and CIP2A (p < 0.001) (data not shown) significantly
associates with ER-negative tumors supporting that PP2A
inhibition negatively correlates with ER expression.
Interestingly, high CPscore was also associated with
negative PR expression in our cohort which suggests
a potential role of PP2A regulating PR expression that
should be experimentally confirmed in future studies.
Furthermore, we found a direct correlation between PP2A
inhibition and HER2 positive tumors which is consistent
with a previous work which described that p-PP2A is
positively modulated by HER2 signaling pathway [43].
However, we unexpectedly observed that p-PP2A showed
lower association with HER2 (p = 0.056) in our cohort
than CPscore with HER2 (p = 0.049), and these results
could be explained by a potential loop regulation between
PP2A and HER2. Further studies are needed to clarify
this point. Finally, to investigate the potential clinical
relevance of PP2A phosphorylation/inhibition we studied
a cohort of 230 breast cancer patients. Importantly, higher
CPscore determined significantly shorter OS and EFS and
multivariate analysis showed that PP2A phosphorylation/
inhibition is a recurrent alteration with an independent
prognostic value in breast cancer. However, it remains
necessary to further analyze the clinical value of this
CPscore in prospective studies focused on individual
breast cancer molecular subtypes.
In conclusion, our results highlight that PP2A
inhibition is a common event with high molecular
and clinical relevance in breast cancer. Moreover, the
high prevalence of this alteration suggests that PP2A
hyperphosphorylation and CIP2A overexpression
represent key mechanisms to inhibit PP2A in breast
cancer, and our proposed CPscore would serve to define a
subgroup of patients who might benefit from the inclusion
of PP2A activators such as FTY720 in anticancer protocols
for treating breast cancer patients alone or combined with
an anthracycline-based chemotherapy backbones.

HTB-20) in DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS and insulin
(0.01 μg/ml). Cell lines were grown as monolayers at 37°C
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Media were supplemented with
L-glutamine (2 nM) (Gibco), penicillin G (100 U/ml),
and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Gibco). Cells were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and authenticated (LGC Standards). Reagents:
doxorubicin (10 μM) (Sigma Aldrich), okadaic acid (OA)
(2.5 nM) and FTY720 (10 μM) (Calbiochem). To generate
doxorubicin-resistant cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were
cultured in the presence of increasing doses of doxorubicin
(three subculturing cycles per concentration), starting at
0.5 μM. In order to assess the evolution of resistance, we
determined the IC50 after every doxorubicin concentration
point, by using an MTS assay (Promega) at 24 h of
treatment. The resistance of every doxorubicin-resistant
clone was defined as the ratio between resistant and
parental cells IC50 values.

were evaluated by IHC and HER2 amplification was
determined by FISH. High proliferation in breast cancer
based on Ki67 labelling by IHC was defined following
the 13th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference
(2013) criteria based on a threshold ≥ 20% of proliferation
[49]. Clinical data and follow-up were obtained from
review of the patients’ medical records. Pre-treatment
patient staging was classified using the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for breast
cancer. Clinical tumor response to primary chemotherapy
was evaluated according to the International Union
Against Cancer Criteria [50]. A clinical complete
response (cCR) was defined as the disappearance of all
detectable malignant disease within the breast by physical
examination. A reduction greater than 50% in the product
of the two maximum perpendicular diameters of the
tumor was classified as clinical partial response (cPR).
Clinical progressive disease (cPD) was considered as an
increase of at least 25%. Clinical stable disease (cSD)
was defined when clinical breast cancer response did not
meet the criteria for cCR, cPR or cPD. Post-chemotherapy
specimens were evaluated for pathological response. A
pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as
no histological evidence of invasive disease in the tumor
specimen [51].

Patient samples
Surgical resection specimens from primary breast
tumors were obtained from Parc de Salut Mar Biobank
(MARBiobanc, Barcelona, Spain), Fundación Jiménez
Díaz Biobank (Madrid, Spain) and Valencia Clinic
Hospital Biobank (Valencia, Spain). Tumor specimens
from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks
were retrospectively selected from consecutive breast
cancer patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2000,
which had the following criteria: infiltrating carcinomas,
operable, no neoadjuvant therapy, enough available
tissue and clinical follow-up. TNM (tumor–node–
metastasis) staging was classified using the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.
Histological grade was defined according Scarff–Bloom–
Richardson modified by Elston criteria [45]. ER and PR
were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (SP1
and PgR636 clones, respectively; Dako, Carpinteria,
CA) establishing positivity criteria in > 1% of nuclear
tumor staining [46]. HER2 amplification was assayed
by FISH (Pathvysion; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,
IL) [47]. Ki-67 was studied by IHC (MIB1 clone; Dako)
[48]. Clinical data were collected from medical clinical
records by oncologists. Representative areas of each
tumor were carefully selected and three tissue cores (1 mm
diameter) were obtained using a TMA workstation (T1000
Chemicon).
In addition, we included in the study an independent
series of 35 patients with locally advanced breast cancer
who had been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
from FJD-Biobank and pre-chemotherapy diagnostic
core needle biopsies were achieved. Pre-treatment tumor
specimens were histologically evaluated. As a part of the
established routine protocol, ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67

Ex vivo models
Tissue slices larger than 1.5 cm from fresh surgical
specimens of patients newly diagnosed with invasive
breast cancer were obtained to add ex vivo doxorubicin and
assess molecular effects [52]. The samples were processed
in sterile conditions immediately after surgical resection.
Incubation was performed in 24-well plates at 37°C in
a constant atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 24 hours. At 24
hours, the specimens were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin for 16 hours at room temperature and embedded
in paraffin under vacuum conditions. These specimens
were assayed for molecular markers as described in the
IHC section.

Western blot analysis

In vivo animal model

PP2A phosphatase activity assays

All animal work was conducted as per the Barcelona
Biomedical Research Park (PRBB) Institutional Animal
Care and Scientific Committee guidelines. Briefly, 46week old female Balb/C nude mice were subcutaneously
inoculated in their flank with 10 x 106 MDA-MB-231
cells mixed with Matrigel as previously described [53].
Tumor growth was measured twice a week. Mice bearing
subcutaneous 100–150 mm3 tumors were distributed
homogenously into four groups of 10 mice each. The first
group received saline vehicle intraperitoneally (i.p.) with
no active drugs. In the second group, doxorubicin (2 mg/kg
in saline) was inoculated i.p. twice a week [54]. In the
third group, FTY720 (10 mg/kg in saline) was inoculated
i.p. every two days [31]. The last group received the
combination of both drugs at the same doses. At the end of
the experiment, tumors were harvested and formalin-fixed.

Protein extracts were isolated using TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen). PP2A assays were performed with 50 μg
protein extracts using a PP2A immunoprecipitation
phosphatase assay kit (Millipore) and following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, PP2A was
immunoprecipitated using 4 μg of PP2A antibody and 25 μl
Protein A agarose slurry, both supplied by the kit. After 2
h of incubation in constant rocking, samples were washed
3 times with TBS 1X followed by one additional wash with
a ser/thr assay buffer also provided by the kit. Next, 60 μl
of a diluted phosphopeptide at 750 μM and 40 μl of ser/thr
assay buffer were added, and the mix was incubated for
5 min at 30°C in a shaking incubator, and then 25 μl of
the mix was transferred into each well of a 96-well plate.
Each measurement was performed in triplicates. 100 μl of
Malachite Green Detection Solution was added, and the mix
was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Absorbance
at 650 nm was used to calculate the amount of phosphate
released (pmol) using a standard curve (0–2000 pmol).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunostainings were performed on tissue
sections (3 μm) obtained from FFPE tumors as previously
described [55]. Briefly, heat antigen retrieval was
performed in pH9 EDTA-based buffer (Dako) and slides
were incubated with same primary antibodies against
CIP2A, SET p-PP2A, p-AKT or p-ERK [50], followed
of appropriate anti-Ig horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
polymer (Flex+, Dako). Sections were visualized with
3,3’-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. All stainings were
performed in a Dako Autostainer. Sections incubated with
normal non-immunized rabbit immunoglobulins were
used as negative controls. As positive control, sections of
breast tumor with known expression of targets were used.
Antibody sensitivity was calculated in a range of crescent
dilutions of primary antibody (CIP2A: 1:20–1:200, SET:
1:100–1:5000, p-PP2A: 1:200–1:2000, p-AKT: 1:1–1:100,
p-ERK: 1:50–1:500). Specificity was confirmed in a set of
paired fresh frozen and FFPE samples were processed by
western blot and IHC. Antigen preservation in tissues was
confirmed assaying for expression of phospho-tyrosines
using a monoclonal antibody to tyrosine-phosphorylated
proteins (clone 4G10, 1:500, Millipore). Only the
membrane of epithelial cells, but not stromal cells, was
evaluated for CIP2A, SET and p-PP2A expression blinded
to clinical data was evaluated by two investigators (FR
and SZ). A semiquantitative histoscore (Hscore) was
calculated by estimation of the percentage of tumor cells
positively stained with low, medium, or high staining
intensity. The final score was determined after applying a
weighting factor to each estimate. The formula used was
