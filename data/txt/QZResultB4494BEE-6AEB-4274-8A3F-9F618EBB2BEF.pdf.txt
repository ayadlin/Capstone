ABSTRACT
Genomic alterations involving translocations of the ETS-related gene ERG occur
in approximately half of prostate cancer cases. These alterations result in aberrant,
androgen-regulated production of ERG protein variants that directly contribute
to disease development and progression. This study describes the discovery and
characterization of a new class of small molecule ERG antagonists identified through
rational in silico methods. These antagonists are designed to sterically block DNA
binding by the ETS domain of ERG and thereby disrupt transcriptional activity. We
confirmed the direct binding of a lead compound, VPC-18005, with the ERG-ETS domain
using biophysical approaches. We then demonstrated VPC-18005 reduced migration
and invasion rates of ERG expressing prostate cancer cells, and reduced metastasis in
a zebrafish xenograft model. These results demonstrate proof-of-principal that small
molecule targeting of the ERG-ETS domain can suppress transcriptional activity and
reverse transformed characteristics of prostate cancers aberrantly expressing ERG.
Clinical advancement of the developed small molecule inhibitors may provide new
therapeutic agents for use as alternatives to, or in combination with, current therapies
for men with ERG-expressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

response element of transmembrane protease serine 2
(TMPRSS2) to variable open reading frames of the ETS
family member, ETS-related gene ERG [3]. Normally
ERG is not expressed by prostatic epithelial cells, but
fusion with TMPRSS2 promoter causes aberrant AR-driven
ERG expression making it one of the most commonly
overexpressed genes in PCa. ERG is known to normally
regulate endothelial and hematopoietic cell differentiation
[4], and has been implicated as a driver of subsets of
Ewing’s sarcomas, leukemias and primitive neuroectoderm

Although confounded by disease heterogeneity, the
emergence of genome-wide analytics has begun to reveal
the spectrum of recurrent genomic alterations that may
directly affect prostate cancer (PCa) disease progression
and outcome [1, 2]. The first identified, and most prevalent
genetic irregularities, occurring in ~50% of PCa patients,
involves inter- or intrachromosomal rearrangements
that result in fusion of the androgen receptor (AR) DNA

tumors [5]. Detection of TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements in
approximately 20% of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasias suggest that these translocations occur early in
disease [6]. Whereas the clinical implication of TMPRSS2ERG rearrangements in PCa remain controversial, many
studies have linked patients with these rearrangements
with poor disease outcome [7, 8]. Such observations
have spurred efforts to establish non-invasive screens for
TMPRSS2-ETS translocations alone or in conjunction with
other prostatic biomarkers to improve risk stratification of
men diagnosed with PCa [9, 10].
ERG has been implicated as an oncogenic hub that
modulates PCa-associated phenotypes, including disruption
of the epithelial differentiation program via AR dysregulation
[11], activation of c-Myc, epigenetic reprogramming via
EZH2 [12] and promotion of genomic instability via PARP
dysregulation [13]. Furthermore, ERG overexpression results
in transcriptional reprogramming of prostate epithelium
that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and enables the transformed cells to acquire migratory
and invasive characteristics [11, 14]. Additionally, ERG
expression is frequently reactivated in castration-resistant
PCa (CRPC) and has been associated with an increased
chance of resistance to taxane therapies [15, 16]. Whereas
ERG expression is initially driven by the AR via fusion with
androgen-responsive promoters, self-driven, feed-forward
regulation of the remaining wild-type ERG allele has been
reported [17]. Recently, inactivating mutations in the E3
ubiquitin ligase SPOP has also been indicated to decrease
ERG degradation, leading to elevated levels of wild-type
ERG [18, 19]. Thus, accumulation of the mutant and wildtype ERG proteins, initially driven by AR, that later become
self-sustained when in conjunction with mutations in SPOP,
presents a new mechanism that may contribute to resistance
against AR pathway inhibitors and, through sustained
induction of EMT, to disease progression in CRPC.
Evidence that ERG expression in PCa is a critical
factor driving PCa development, progression, and
metastasis [7, 8] makes it a promising drug target.
The feasibility of direct targeting ERG has been first
demonstrated by a small molecule, YK-4-279, identified
from surface plasmon resonance screening of a smallmolecule collection from the National Cancer Institute
Drug Targeting Program to disrupt the binding of RNA
Helicase A to ETS factor, FLI1, in Ewing’s sarcoma
[20]. YK-4-279 has also been reported to antagonize
ERG activity, although its exact ETS binding mode has
yet to be determined [21]. While YK-4-279 is in clinical
development for Ewing’s sarcoma, issues related to
toxicity and pharmacokinetics have been reported [22].
Thus, there are currently no approved drugs that directly
target ERG or any other member of the ETS family [4, 23].
We hypothesized that the use of rational drug design
approach, supported by in vitro and in vivo screening
methods, could identify small molecules that directly
target the DNA-binding ETS domain of ERG and thereby
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibit metastatic potential of ERG-positive PCa. Here
we report use of an established drug discovery pipeline
[24] that combines in silico prediction with in vitro and
in vivo experimentation to identify a new class of antiERG compounds. We demonstrate that a lead anti-ERG
compound, VPC-18005, inhibits ERG-induced transcription
and interacts directly with the ERG-ETS domain, and
disrupts the ERG binding to DNA. In addition, the
compound reduces migration and invasion rates of ERGoverexpressing cells, and inhibits metastasis in zebrafish
xenograft models. These results demonstrate that the
discovered compound and its derivatives can be developed
as therapeutic options for mitigating disease progression in
men with ERG-expressing prostate cancer and ultimately
lead to improved survival for men with advanced disease.

RESULTS
Discovery of small molecules that target the
DNA-binding ETS domain of ERG protein
There are numerous TMPRSS2-ERG fusions that
encode for ERG transcripts. Whereas, the majority produce
amino terminal-truncated ERG proteins, all retain the
C-terminal DNA-binding ETS domain [8]. This DNAbinding ETS domain is essential for ERG to function as a
direct transcriptional regulator, and structural data is available
for its complex with DNA. Thus, we reasoned that we could
use in silico approaches to identify small molecules targeting
the ETS domain. Such molecules should therefore inhibit
transcriptional activity of all functional ERG mutant proteins
by antagonizing their ability to interact with DNA. This in
turn might disrupt ERG-mediated transformational events
involved in PCa disease development and progression.
A structure-based virtual screening approach,
previously established for targeting protein-DNA and
protein-protein interaction interfaces [24], was applied to
the 1.7Å resolution ERG-ETS domain crystal structure
[PDB ID: 4IRG] [25]. The DNA binding interface was
identified from a 2.8 Å resolution crystal structure of
the corresponding ERG-DNA complex [PDB ID: 4IRI]
(Figure 1A). The ERG-ETS domain contains a winged
helix-turn-helix motif, with helix α3 positioned within the
major groove of the DNA containing a cognate GGAA
sequence [25]. A top-ranked druggable surface pocket was
identified by virtual atomic probes to partially overlap this
ERG-DNA interface (Figure 1B). The identified pocket
is adjacent to the DNA recognition helix (α3), and thus
it was predicted that a small molecule bound at this site
will competitively block DNA binding. Three million
chemical structures derived from the ZINC database [26]
were individually docked into this pocket. Combining
the docking scores, binding poses, consensus voting and
drug-like properties (detailed in Materials and Methods),
an initial set of 48 compounds, representing 45 different
chemical classes, were selected for in vitro analysis.

To evaluate the biological anti-ERG activity of
the compounds identified above, we first assessed ERG
expression in a panel of prostate cell lines (Figure 1C).
We confirmed expression of the ERG protein in VCaP
(endogenous overexpression) and PNT1B-ERG cells (stable
ERG overexpression [14]). In contrast, PC3, PNT1B and
PNT1B-Mock cells were negative for ERG expression
[14, 27]. Each of the compounds was first evaluated in
PNT1B-ERG cells at concentrations of 10 μM and 25 μM
for its ability to inhibit ERG transcriptional activation of
a transiently transfected, endoglin E3 promoter-derived
[28], ETS-responsive firefly luciferase reporter (pETS-luc)
construct containing 3 conserved ETS recognition (GGAA)
motifs. A representative example of 5 compounds that
showed suppression of the luciferase reporter by 20%-60%
are identified in Figure 1D. Compound VPC-18005 was
identified as the most potent inhibitor of luciferase activity
from this initial set. The molecular docking score of
VPC-18005 was ranked in the top 0.01% of all 3 million
molecules evaluated in the virtual screening discussed
earlier (Figure 1E). Before proceeding with in-depth
analysis, the media solubility and stability of VPC-18005
were assessed (Supplementary Figure 1). VPC-18005 was
soluble in media and remained stable for at least 3 days
(93%). For comparison, the published inhibitor YK-4-279
was soluble but less stable (60%). A more thorough dose
response analysis was performed using both VCaP and
PNT1B-ERG cells to evaluate the potency of VPC-18005.
VPC-18005 was found to inhibit pETS-luc reporter activity
in PNT1B-ERG and VCaP cells with IC50 values of 3 and
6 μM, respectively (Figure 1F). For comparison, YK-4-279
[21] exhibited IC50 values of 5 μM and 16 μM in PNT1BERG and VCaP cell-based ETS-Luc reporter assays,
respectively (Figure 1G).
In order to assess whether the suppressed pETS-luc
reporter activity was due to cytotoxicity, an MTS assay
was performed over 72 hours (h) to measure the impact
of the compounds on cell viability (Figure 1H). VPC18005 treatment (0.2–25 μM) did not decrease viability of
either ERG-expressing cells (PNT1B-ERG and VCaP) or
non-ERG expressing (PC3) prostatic cells. Previous
reports suggest that the IC50 for YK-4-279 cytotoxicity is
10 μM in VCaP cells and > 100 μM in PC3 cells [21].
However in this study we observed YK-4-279-mediated
inhibition of cell viability in both ERG expressing and nonERG expressing cell lines at doses ≥ 5 µM (Figure 1H).
Cell cycle analysis was conducted and confirmed the
results of the viability assay (Supplementary Figure 2A).
Whereas VPC-18005 did not impact cell cycle distribution,
YK-4-279 substantially increased the sub-G0 population at
5 and 10 μM doses (p = 0.003 and 0.003, respectively).
The G0–G1 phase population was concomitantly reduced
after 5 and 10 µM YK-4-279 treatment (p = 0.003 and
0.006, respectively). Real time cell analysis showed that
VPC-18005 did not suppress proliferation or induce cell
death (Supplementary Figure 2B). A dose-dependent effect
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of YK-4-279 on cell growth was observed (Supplementary
Figure 2C), and the cells were observed to have altered
morphology, indicative of toxicity and cell death.
To further assess if VPC-18005 has any nonspecific cellular effect, luciferase assays were performed
in PNT1B-MOCK and -ERG cells treated with increasing
concentrations of VPC-18005 (Supplementary Figure 3A),
and VPC-18005 had minimal impact on the reporter signal
in PNT1B-MOCK as compared to PNT1B-ERG cells.
Furthermore, overexpression of ERG protein through
R1881 treatment counteracted VPC-18005 inhibition in the
luciferase assay (Supplementary Figure 3B). VPC-18005
was also tested against an androgen receptor luciferase
reporter (ARR3tk-luc) and showed no significant effect
on the reporter expression (Supplementary Figure 3C).
Collectively, these results indicated that VPC-18005 could
suppress ERG reporter activity without exhibiting overt
cytotoxicity.

Direct binding of VPC-18005 to the ERG-ETS
domain
The chemical structure of VPC-18005 is depicted
in Figure 2A. Using computational modeling methods,
the predicted binding pose of VPC-18005 was visualized
in more detail inside the target pocket on the ERG-ETS
domain (Figure 2B and 2C). VPC-18005 is composed of
a hydrophobic isopropyl benzyl group at one end and a
negatively charged 5′ carboxyl 4-thiazolidanone group on
the other end, linked by an azo moiety with conjugated
double bonds. Within the binding pocket on the ERG-ETS
domain, VPC-18005 is predicted to form a salt bridge
with Lys357, hydrogen bonds with Leu313, Trp351 and
Tyr372, and hydrophobic interactions with a number
of surrounding amino acid residues, including Gln312,
Trp314, Tyr371, Tyr372, Lys375, Ile377, Ile395, Ala398,
and Leu399 (residue numbering based on ERG isoform 5,
UniProt ID: P11308-4; Figure 2C).
We utilized NMR spectroscopy to directly assess the
binding of VPC-18005 with the ERG-ETS domain. The
15
N-HSQC spectrum of 15N-labelled protein (100 μM) was
assessed in the presence of increasing concentrations of
DMSO-solubilized VPC-18005 (Supplementary Figure 5A
and 5B), as well as with a DMSO control (Supplementary
Figure 5D and 5E). The spectra demonstrated small dosedependent chemical shifts changes for a number of amide
1 N 15
H - N groups that occurred upon addition of VPC18005, but not DMSO. A chemical shift perturbation plot
with VPC-18005 at 1:10 molar ratio (i.e. 1 mM) showed
that protein residues with changes greater than the mean
(0.01 ppm) were mostly located along helix α1, helix α3
and strand β3 (Figure 2D). These amides cluster around
the predicted binding pocket of VPC-18005 (Figure 2E),
supportive of its binding pose with the ERG protein.
Of note, residues with perturbed amide chemical shifts,
including Leu313 on helix α1 and Tyr371, Try372, Lys375

on helix α3, modeled to interact with VPC-18005 through
hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, have also
been previously shown to be involved in ERG-DNA
interactions [25]. Fitting of the 15N-HSQC titration curves
to a simple 1:1 binding isotherm yielded a KD value of
~3 mM for the interaction of VPC-18005 with recombinant
ERG-ETS domain (Supplementary Figure 5C). To further
localize the binding interactions between VPC-18005 and
the ERG-ETS domain, the reverse titration was performed.
In this case, the 1H-NMR spectrum of VPC-18005 was
monitored vs. increasing concentrations of recombinant
ERG-ETS domain. Several 1H nuclei of VPC-18005
exhibited ERG-dependent chemical shift perturbations.
These include the hydrogens on the aromatic ring (1H 7.78
and 7.45 ppm), the methyls on the isopropyl group
(1H 1.25 ppm) and the conjugated double bond (1H 8.4 ppm)
(Figure 2F). Due to the spectral overlap with signals
from DMSO, perturbations from the CH2 group near the
carboxyl group of VPC-18005 could not be determined.
Overall, these two complimentary direct binding assay
results are consistent with the proposed model for how
VPC-18005 binds to the ERG-ETS protein domain at the
interface required for DNA interaction.

disrupted ERG-DNA complex formation (Supplementary
Figure 6C–6E). Collectively, these results indicate that
VPC-18005 can disrupt binding of the ERG protein to the
DNA containing ETS-response elements.
A previous study [29] has shown that ERG
induces SOX9 gene expression through an AR-regulated
enhancer in VCaP. SOX9, a member of the SOX (SRYrelated HMG box) family, is a transcription factor that is
required for prostate organogenesis, and its dysregulation
has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis [30]. SOX9
overexpression in an LNCaP xenograft mouse model
resulted in increased tumor growth and invasion [31], and
SOX9 depletion in VCaP was shown to inhibit in vitro
and in vivo invasion [29]. SOX9 is basally expressed in
VCaP cells and elevated following Metribolone (R1881)
treatment (Figure 4A). Basal and R1881-stimulated SOX9
mRNA and protein expressions were markedly decreased
following VPC-18005 treatment. Reduction of ERG and
SOX9 expression was also confirmed following siRNA
knockdown of ERG in VCaP cells compared to nonspecific (NS) siRNA control (Figure 4B).

VPC-18005 inhibits migration and invasion of
ERG-overexpressing cells in vitro

VPC-18005 disrupts binding of the ERG-ETS
domain to DNA

ERG promotes EMT, which enables cells to acquire
migratory and invasive characteristics [7]. We have
previously shown that PNT1B cells acquired these invasive
characteristics when ERG was stably overexpressed [14].
Therefore, we aimed to determine if VPC-18005 was able
to affect migration and invasion of these cells. PNT1BMOCK and -ERG cells were plated into the upper chamber
of a double chamber real-time cell analysis system and
treated with VPC-18005 after 24 h. As expected, in
the absence of VPC-18005, PNT1B-ERG exhibited an
increased rate of migration toward the serum-containing
bottom chamber compared to the PNT1B-MOCK control
(Figure 5A and 5B). After 24 h exposure and in comparison
to a DMSO control, VPC-18005 (5  µM) significantly
reduced the rate of migration of the PNT1B-ERG cells
relative to vehicle-treated cells, and the resulting migration
rate was indistinguishable from that observed for vehicle
treated PNT1B-MOCK cells (Figure 5C). In contrast, but
consistent with the cytotoxicity results described earlier,
treatment with YK-4-279 resulted in cytotoxicity in both
cell lines. RWPE prostate cells, engineered to overexpress
ERG, were also tested in this assay. No effect on cell
viability was observed following treatment with increasing
concentrations of VPC-18005 (Supplementary Figure 4A),
and VPC-18005 had a moderate effect on RWPE-ERG cell
migration compared to MOCK control (Supplementary
Figure 4B and 4C). To further explore this inhibitory effect
of VPC-18005, PNT1B-ERG spheroids, pretreated for
24 h with vehicle control or VPC-18005, were submerged
in matrix in the presence or absence of treatments, and
monitored for 6 days (Figure 5D). Analysis of images

As there was no obvious effect of VPC-18005 on
general cytotoxicity (Figure 1H), we assessed whether the
impact of VPC-18005 treatment on ETS reporter activity
was due to decreased ERG protein stability. Pre–treatment
with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not
induce ERG degradation after treatment with VPC-18005
at up to 50 µM for 4 h (Figure 3A). At extended time
points of 24 and 48 h, there was still no observable ERG
protein degradation (Supplementary Figure 3D).
Since ERG protein levels were stable in cells
treated with VPC-18005 and NMR data supported
its direct binding to the ERG-ETS domain, we next
assessed whether VPC-18005 could disrupt ERG-DNA
binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)
were performed using purified ERG-ETS domain and a
DNA oligonucleotide containing the consensus GGAA
recognition motif. The recombinant ERG-ETS domain
binds this cognate DNA with a KD ~ 1 nM (Supplementary
Figure 6A). VPC-18005, but not DMSO control, exhibited
dose-dependent disruption of recombinant ERG-ETS/
DNA complex formation (Figure 3B) with a KI value of
~250 μM (Supplementary Figure 6B). Although indicative
of relatively weak binding, this is in agreement with the
KD value determined for the interaction of the ERG-ETS
domain and VPC-18005 using 15N-HSQC spectroscopy
(Supplementary Figure 5C). In contrast, YK-4-279 did not
disrupt binding between the ERG-ETS domain and DNA
(Figure 3B). These results were further confirmed using
VCaP nuclear lysate where VPC-18005, but not YK-4-279,

PNT1B-MOCK and PNT1B-ERG could disseminate
through the zebrafish body (Figure 5E). Fluorescently
tagged cells were injected into the yolk sac, and after 5
days PNT1B-ERG could be seen throughout the body of
the fish (Supplementary Video 1). In contrast, PNT1BMOCK cells were not detected outside of the yolk sac.
The embryos also remained viable when cultured in
the presence of up to 50 μM VPC-18005 for 72 h. In
contrast, YK-4-279-treated embryos exhibited toxicity at
concentrations > 10 μM (Figure 5F). Yolk sac-inoculated
PNT1B-ERG and VCaP cells were found to become
disseminated toward the head and tail of 65 to 70% of
embryos, respectively. When cultured in the presence
of VPC-18005 at 1 and 10 μM, this percentage of fish
with PNT1B-ERG or VCaP dissemination was reduced
to 20–30% of inoculated animals (Figure 5G). Culturing
embryos in YK-4-279 at 1 and 10 μM resulted in yolk
sac dissemination in 40–60% of inoculated animals
(Figure 5G). These assays provide first principle evidence
that small molecules such as VPC-18005 can antagonize
the metastatic potential of ERG-expressing prostate cells.

targeting these transcription factors with small molecules
is a challenging task due to their lack of “druggable” active
sites. ERG is an important therapeutic target in PCa. We
confirmed ERG overexpression in PCa by comparing
tumor-specific upregulated genes from three published
datasets [1, 33, 34] based on a 2-fold differential expression
threshold (Supplementary Figure 7). Whereas there were
a number of genes dysregulated in each pair-wise dataset
comparison (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), the only
upregulated gene common in all three datasets was ERG.
This highlights ERG as a potential major influencer of
PCa. There are currently several reports describing efforts
to target ERG with various agents, but none have resulted
in approved therapeutics. These include the use of siRNA
[35, 36], shRNA [37], peptidomimetics [38] and a small
molecule, DB1255 that interacts not with the ERG protein
but rather the ETS recognition site on the DNA (GGAA)
[39]. In addition, ERG has been targeted indirectly through
inhibition of ERG binding proteins including PARP1 [13]
and USP9X [40], as well as via ERG-regulated genes, such
as YAP1 [41]. As noted earlier, among the various efforts
to antagonize ERG, only one small molecule, YK-4-279,
has been reported to directly target the ERG protein [22],
but with limitations detailed above.
In contrast to these attempts, we utilized an
established rational drug discovery approach [24] to directly
target the DNA-binding interface of the ERG-ETS domain.

DISCUSSION
The ETS family of transcription factors are
important targets for drug development because of their
strong implications in numerous cancers [4]. However,

NMR spectroscopy experiments demonstrated that VPC18005 binds directly to the ETS domain of the ERG protein.
The NMR data were consistent with the in silico modelling
of the binding mode of VPC-18005 with ERG. In particular,
the perturbation of Tyr371, a key residue required for the
ERG-DNA interaction [25], by VPC-18005 observed
in 15N-HSQC spectra provides a possible antagonizing
mechanism. Superimposing VPC-18005 over the DNA at
the ERG pocket further revealed the predicted mutually
exclusive nature of their binding interfaces (Figure 6). Not
only does VPC-18005 partially occupy the same interface
as the DNA, but the negatively-charged carboxyl group
is also mapped directly on top of the negatively-charged
phosphate group of the DNA backbone.
It is also noteworthy that VPC-18005 binds the
isolated ERG-ETS domain in vitro with mM affinity, and
this is substantially weaker than the nM affinity interaction
of ERG with its cognate DNA sequences. However, in the
context of the cellular milieu, transcription factor binding to
DNA is malleable and susceptible to chemical perturbations
[42, 43]. Thus, VPC-18005 is biologically active when
present in cell-based assays at μM concentrations. The
differences between these in vitro versus in vivo results
could arise for numerous reasons spanning from potentially
elevated intracellular concentrations of VPC-18005 to
highly sensitive effects of this compound on the network
of cooperative intermolecular interactions required for
transcription. Overall, VPC-18005 is the first reported
small molecule inhibitor (SMI) that directly antagonizes
the DNA-binding interface on the ERG protein, and it adds

to the few successful examples where SMIs have been
shown to disrupt protein-DNA interactions of transcription
factors [42].
The use of a minimal promoter-Renilla luciferase
control suggested that inhibition from VPC-18005 was
specific to the ERG-responsive reporter and not a nonspecific effect on general transcription (Supplementary
Figure 9B). However, due to the sequence conservation at
the ETS domain, it is expected that anti-ERG compounds
such as VPC-18005 will have the potential to bind and
inhibit other ETS factors. Indeed, preliminary NMR
spectroscopic experiments revealed that VPC-18005
also interacts with the ETS domains of PU.1 and ETV4.
Nevertheless, as demonstrated here, VPC-18005 is
non-toxic at active concentrations and thus far has not
demonstrated any specificity-related issues. It should also
be noted that many of these ETS factors are oncogenic
and have been implicated in a wide spectrum of cancers
[4]. Although future development of new VPC-18005
derivatives can be prioritized based on their selective
binding towards ERG, those showing promiscuous or
increased specificities for alternative ETS factors should
be considered as lead therapeutics towards cancers linked
to those factors.
VPC-18005 inhibits ERG transcriptional activity in
a dose dependent manner. Additionally, VPC-18005 can
inhibit the expression of an ERG-regulated gene, SOX9,
which has been previously shown to stimulate PCa invasion
[29, 31]. VPC-18005 did not affect cell viability, but did
influence cell motility, leading to reduced migration/

Figure 6: Mutually exclusive binding of VPC-18005 and DNA with the ERG-ETS domain. The position of the carboxyl

group in VPC-18005 (orange = carbon, blue = nitrogen, red = oxygen, yellow = sulfur) is predicted to coincide with that of a phosphate
group on the DNA backbone (cyan ribbons and sticks). Thus, binding of VPC-18005 or DNA with the ERG-ETS domain is expected to be
mutually exclusive. Whereas the lower portion of the VPC-18005 chemical structure occupies the same general area as the DNA, the upper
portion, consisted of the isopropyl moiety and aromatic ring, extends further into the pocket (shown in grey net). The ERG-ETS protein
structure is rotated –90 degree on the vertical axis, compared to those shown in Figure 2.

invasion of cells in vitro and in a zebrafish xenograft model.
As cancer cell death is a measure of toxicity and cancer cell
immobility is a measure of metastasis prevention, our study
supports non-toxic anti-metastatic applications of VPC18005 and its derivatives. Future clinical studies of such
anti-ERG drugs can be modelled based on previous clinical
trials for anti-metastatic drugs to target patients with
metastatic disease of low burden [44]. Key indicators of
anti-metastatic drug efficacy in patients include inhibition
of further metastasis/invasion of tissues, decreased skeletal
related conditions, decreased pain/narcotic use, increased
survival (decreased end organ destruction), and decrease
of circulating tumor cells [45].
In summary, these results demonstrate proof-ofprincipal that small molecule targeting of the ERGETS domain can suppress transcriptional activity and
reverse transformed characteristics of prostate cancers
aberrantly expressing ERG. The current lead compound,
VPC-18005, inhibited ERG with low micromolar
concentrations at in vitro and in vivo experiments. In murine
pharmacodynamics and toxicology studies, VPC-18005 is
soluble, stable and orally bioavailable, and does not exhibit
general toxicity at single doses of up to 500 mg/kg, and after
a 4 week BID at 150 mg/kg trial (Supplementary Figure 10).
We anticipate that future medicinal chemistry (medchem)
efforts will improve its activity into a sub-micromolar or
nanomolar range. Indeed, our initial medchem development
has identified additional derivatives through chemical
similarities and modifications of the VPC-18005 scaffold
(Supplementary Table 3). Of these candidates VPC-18065
and 18098, with terminal moieties that are more hydrophobic,
demonstrated slightly better IC50 values (2 μM and 1 μM
respectively in luciferase assays) compared to VPC-18005
(Supplementary Figure 8). The removal of the carboxyl
group in VPC-18100 resulted in the loss of inhibition in
the luciferase reporter assays, as we expected given that
the carboxylate is predicted to form a salt-bridge with
the nearby Lys357. Although the modifications tested to
date have not yet resulted in significant sub-micromolar
activity, these derivatives do provide a working structureactivity relationship that will guide future medchem efforts.
DNA binding domains of transcription factors are often
conserved and exhibit low rates of mutations as a structural
compromise is likely to translate into a loss of function
[46]. Targeting such DNA-interacting regions may increase
the value of the corresponding drugs due to less mutationdriven resistance, but also makes direct assessment of
binding specificity by mutagenesis challenging.
PCa, one of the most common malignancies in men,
is treated by surgery and radiation at the early stage, but
eventually progresses to advanced forms that are managed
primarily by the androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The
effectiveness of ADT is only temporary due to resistance
mechanisms related to aberrant androgen production and
mutations in the androgen receptor [47]. Recent studies not
only established ERG as a critical drug target in PCa [7],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

but also reported on ERG feed-forward regulation. This
supports the notion that despite initial dependence on the
androgen receptor, ERG expression can eventually become
self-driven and resistant against ADT [17]. Thus, anti-ERG
drug prototypes such as VPC-18005 developed through
rational drug design as reported here can specifically target
the malignant transformation and metastasis driven by the
ERG, and are not susceptible to current PCa treatment
limitations such as drug resistance against anti-androgens
and side effects from ADT. With the availability of noninvasive urine tests for ERG detection [9], future antiERG drugs can be specifically prescribed to the 50% of
PCa patients who are ERG-positive and pave the way for
precision medicine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In silico modeling and virtual screening
The published ERG-ETS domain X-ray crystal
structure (PDB: 4IRG) [25] was subjected to the Site
Finder algorithm, implemented in the Molecular Operating
Environment (MOE) [48], which used virtual atomic probes
to search the protein surface for suitable small molecule
binding pockets. The crystal structure of an ERG/DNA
complex (PDB: 4IRI) [25] was used to define the ERGDNA interface. The top-ranked pocket was identified and
used for the subsequent virtual screening. Before molecular
docking, the ERG-ETS domain structural model was
prepared by using the Protein Preparation Wizard module
of the Maestro v9.3 program from the Schrodinger 2012
software suite. The docking grid was centered at the pocket
composed of the following amino acids: Pro306, Gly307,
Gln310, Ile311, Gln312, Leu313, Trp314, Trp351, Lys355,
Met360, Lys364, Leu365, Ala368, Tyr371, Tyr372, Lys375,
Ile377, Ile395, Ala398, Leu399 (residue numbering based
on ERG isoform 5, UniProt ID: P11308-4). A total of
19,607,722 (~ 20 million) small molecule structures were
downloaded from the ZINC database version 12 [26].
Among the 20 million set, a total of 2,990,102 (~ 3 million)
molecules that possess the following lead-like and drug-like
properties were extracted for molecular docking: molecular
weight between 250 and 400 Da, logP <= 5, hydrogenbond donors <= 5, hydrogen-bond acceptors <= 10,
number of rotatable bonds <= 10, and number of rings
<= 4. Each molecule was given its expected protonation
state at pH 7 and energy-minimized under the MMFF94x
(solvation: Born) force field using MOE. Each molecule
was docked into the previously defined docking grid on
the ERG-ETS domain protein model, using the Glide
program (Small-Molecule Drug Discovery Suite, version
5.8, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2012). Standard
Precision with all other parameters set to default. The top
1% (~30,000 molecules), as ranked by the docking scores
calculated based on interaction forces including hydrogen
bonds and hydrophobic interactions, were selected to

advance into the next stage of virtual screening. Within
this set, a predicted pKi was calculated for each molecule
using a custom MOE SVL script, and ligand efficiency
was calculated using Glide. In addition, this set of 30,000
molecules was re-docked into the same pocket, using the
eHiTs docking program [49]. A root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) was calculated between the docking poses from
Glide and eHiTs for each molecule. A consensus scoring
(voting) method was used each compound received one
vote from each of the following criteria met: 1) top 20%
pKi values, 2) top 20% ligand efficiency values, and 3) top
20% eHiTs docking scores and 4) RMSD <=3 A. The top
3,000 molecules, as ranked by the number of votes, were
selected for the final stage of selection. During this step, the
chemical structure of each molecule within the predicted
ERG-ETS binding pocket was manually examined using
the 3D visual environment in MOE. Preference was given
to compounds with favorable binding poses and interactions
with the surrounding amino acid residues. Molecules were
removed from the selection if they contain problematic or
promiscuous moieties. In addition to manual examination,
the FAFDrugs program [50] was used to assist identification
of such problematic groups. A total of 48 compounds were
selected for testing. MOE and MarvinSketch were used to
visualize and represent the protein models and chemical
structures. Chemical similarity searches based on the
Tanimoto coefficient was performed on the hit compound
VPC-18005 (prepared as detailed in Supplementary
Materials and Methods) in the ZINC database, with
additional medchem derivatives designed using MOE.

ERG (1:1,000, EPR3864(2), Abcam), α-Tubulin (1:20,000,
Millipore), Vinculin (1:1,000, Abcam). Immunoreactivity
was detected with the use of the goat anti-rabbit or rabbit antimouse horseradish peroxidase (HPR)–conjugated secondary
antibody (1:10,000) (Santa Cruz), and visualization was
achieved by chemiluminescence (Pierce). To inhibit protein
synthesis, 10 μM cycloheximide was added for 1 h and then
replaced with treatment medium for indicated time frame.

Dual reporter luciferase assay
All of the compounds selected from the virtual
screening were tested in a luciferase-based ERGresponsive reporter assay, using two ERG-overexpressing
cell lines, VCaP and PNT1B-ERG, previously developed
in house [14]. Cells (3000) in 150 μL per well of a 96
well plate were seeded and after a 24 h incubation were
transfected with 50 ng of an Endoglin E3 promoter-derived
ETS-responsive firefly luciferase reporter (–507/–280
of (E3) promoter [28] inserted into luciferase reporter
vector (Signosis), ARR3tk-luc [24], and 5 ng of the Renilla
luciferase reporter (pRL-tk, Promega) using TransIT 20/20
transfection reagent (Mirus, USA). After 16 h incubation,
treatment media was added for further 48 h. Firefly and
Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a TECAN
M200Pro plate reader. Comparison of empty vector
versus ETS responsive reporter demonstrates activation
only in the presence of the ETS responsive sequence
(Supplementary Figure 9A). Data were normalized
first to Renilla luciferase and then to the DMSO-media
control on each plate, unless otherwise stated. Initial
hit compounds were identified as those with an average
normalized luciferase reading (firefly luciferase/Renilla
luciferase readings) that is 60% or less of the average
normalized luciferase reading of the DMSO-media control
(i.e. 40% or more reduction of luciferase activity) at 10
μM. Representative example of raw Renilla luciferase
readings presented in Supplementary Figure 9B. The
luciferase assays were repeated for each lead compound
under multiple concentrations (0.1 to 100 μM) to establish
a dose-dependent response and an IC50 value. AR reporter
assay was performed as previously described [24].

Cell culture
VCaP (CRL-2876) and PC3 (CRL-1435) human
prostate carcinoma cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). VCaP cells harbor an
endogenous TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion, whereas PC3
cells do not, but do express the ETS family member ETV4.
The immortalized prostatic epithelial cell line, PNT1B
[27] was purchased from ATCC. PNT1B-Mock, PNT1BERG, RWPE-Mock, and RWPE-ERG cells are lineagematched control and ERG-expressing prostatic epithelial
lines generated in house [14]. PC3 cells were maintained
in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented
with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). VCaP cells
were maintained in low bicarbonate DMEM (ATCC)
supplemented with 10% FBS. PNT1B-Mock and –ERG
cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% FBS and under blasticidin
selection. Cells were grown in a humidified, 5% CO2
incubator at 37°C.

Proliferation/ cell viability assay
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyp
henyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS).
Cells were seeded at a density of 3000 cells per well
(except VCaP at 20,000/well) in 100 μL of appropriate
media in 96 well culture dishes. Twenty four hours
later, 100 μL of medium containing vehicle control or
compounds. Each treatment was prepared in triplicate.
After a 72 h treatment, cellular viability was assessed using
CellTiter 96 ® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation
Assay reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Values were normalized to the DMSO control.

was performed by titrating constant 1 nM labeled dsDNA
with ERG at concentrations spanning 0.3 pM to 0.5 μM.
Glycerol (3%) and 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA)
were included in the reaction mixture. After incubated at
room temperature for 1 hr, samples were load on to 10%
polyacrylamide native gel, and electrophoresed at 10°C.
The gel was scanned with Typhoon 9200 Imager equipped
with blue laser to excite at 490 nm and fluorescence was
measured at 520 nm. The scanned image was analyzed with
Image J [48]. Non-linear least squares fitting (GraphPad
Prism) of the titration data to a 1:1 binding isotherm yielded
the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD value ~ 1 nM) for
the ERG- ETS domain interaction with DNA. The binding
isotherm equation is fb,i = [ERG]i/([ERG]i + KD) where
[ERG]i is the total concentration of the ERG-ETS domain
(a valid approximation as KD > 1 nM total dsDNA) at each
titration point (i), and the fraction bound, fb,i was calculated
as the intensity of the bound DNA band at that point
relative to the intensity with saturating 0.5 μM protein.
The result of this initial study was used to set the molar
ratio of ERG-ETS domain:DNA in subsequent competition
assays with VPC-18005. For these assays, 4 nM of the
ERG-ETS domain was mixed with 1 nM of fluorophorelabeled dsDNA, titrated with VPC-18005 (diluted from a
DMSO stock) and analyzed by the same EMSA protocol.
The data were fit to the equation for competitive binding,
fb,i = [ERG]/([ERG] + KD{1 + [VPC-18005]i/KI}), where KI
is the inhibitor dissociation constant and the fraction bound,
fb,i, was calculated the intensity of the bound DNA band
at each titration point relative to that without added VPC18005. A control experiment was carried out by titrating
with equivalent quantities of DMSO.
For experiments involving ERG from VCaP cells,
VCaP nuclear protein was extracted using CelLytic
NuCLEAR Extraction Kit (Sigma). An initial gel shift
assay was performed by titrating constant 1 nM labeled
dsDNA nuclear extract at concentrations spanning
1.1 pg/μl to 1.76 μg/μl (Supplementary Figure 6C). For
subsequent assays, 55 ng/μl of the nuclear extract was
mixed with 1 nM of fluorophore-labeled dsDNA, titrated
with VPC-18005 (diluted from a DMSO stock) and
analyzed by the same EMSA protocol.

ERG-ETS domain expression and purification. A
pET28a plasmid encoding residues 307–400 of the ERGETS domain was expressed in E. coli BL21 (λDE3).
Cultures of 1 L were grown at 37°C in M9 media supplied
with 3 gm/L 13C6-glucose and/or 1 gm/L 15NH4Cl.
Cells were allowed to grow to O.D.600 = 0.6 and protein
expression was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG. After an
induction time of 4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation
and stored at –80°C for at least 1 round of freeze/thaw. Cells
were resuspended in 40 mL of lysis buffer for every 1 L
of culture. Cells were lysed by passing through 5 rounds
of homogenization and 10 mins of sonication. The cell
lysate centrifuged at 15k rpm for 1 hr, and the supernatant
subjected to nickel column purification. The column was
washed using 25 mM imidazole (50 mM phosphate, 1 M
NaCl, pH 7.4) and proteins were eluted with 1 M imidazole.
Fractions containing the ETS domain were confirmed by
SDS-PAGE and pooled. The His6-tag was cleaved by
thrombin and the tag-free sample was concentrated to
2 mL and subjected to S75 size exclusion chromatography.
Fractions were checked by SDS-PAGE and those containing
the pure sample were pooled and concentrated. The protein
ample was dialyzed to NMR buffer (20 mM sodium
phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH
6.5) for all NMR experiments. NMR spectral assignments.
NMR data were recorded at 25 or 28°C on cryoprobeequipped 850 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer. Data
were processed and analyzed using NMRpipe [51] and
Sparky [52]. Signals from backbone and sidechain 1H, 13C,
and 15N nuclei were assigned by standard multidimensional
heteronuclear correlation experiments. NMR-monitored
titrations. Interactions of compounds with the ERG-ETS
domain were monitored via sensitivity-enhanced 15N-HSQC
spectra. Experiments involved titrating unlabeled DMSOsolubilized compound or control DMSO into 15N-labeled
ERG-ETS domain. Chemical shift perturbations were
calculated from the combined amide 1HN and 15N shift
changes as Δδ =  [(0.2  ×  ΔδN)2  + (ΔδH)2]1/2. Reciprocal
titrations were carried out using 1H-NMR to monitor the
effects of progressively adding unlabeled protein to a
sample of VPC-18005 (180 μM) in 20 mM phosphate, 150
mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. The signal
from water was suppressed by pre-saturation.

Analyses of gene expression
Total RNA was extracted from VCaP cells with the
use of RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was
performed with the use of the iScript First-Strand cDNA

(Life Technologies) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Wild-type embryos were dechorionated at 2 dpf. Following
anaesthetization with tricane, approximately 50–70 cancer
cells were microinjected into the yolk sac. Embryos were
then transferred to 100 mm2 plates that contained aquaria
water with added PTU and VPC-18005, YK-4-279
or DMSO control. Embryos were visually assessed
for presence of xenograph. Those embryos that did not
contain cells were removed from the experiment. Embryos
were kept at 35oC for the duration of the experiment.
Approximately, 50 fish were injected per cell line and
metastasis was determined on Day 4 and 5 by observation
using the Zeiss Axio Observer microscope (5X objective)
controlled with Zen 2012 software. Fixed (dead) cells
were used as a control to ensure that the dissemination
observed was not due to yolk sac absorption.

Real time cell analysis (xCELLigence)
Cell migration was monitored using CIM-16
migration plates via the xCELLigence platform (ACEA).
FBS-supplemented media (160 μL) was added to the lower
chamber of the plate and incubated at RT for 30 min. The
upper chamber was then mounted and 30 μL of serum free
media (SFM) was added to each well and left to equilibrate
in the incubator for 1 h at 37°C. After the incubation, a
background reading was taken for each well. PNT1B-ERG
or –MOCK cells, cultured for 24 h in SFM, were seeded
into the wells of the upper chamber at 30,000 cells per
well and after 24 h 100 μL of desired treatment was added
(vehicle control, VPC-18005, and YK-4-279). Real time
readings of cell index values were recorded initially every

5,000 PNT1B-ERG cells and 5 μL of ECM were prepared
in growth media to a total volume of 50 μL and seeded in
3D culture qualified 96 well spheroid formation plate and
incubated at 37°C for 72 hr. Spheroids were pre-treated
with VPC-18005 or DMSO for 24 h after which 50 μL gel
invasion matrix was added. Spheroids were then incubated
at 37°C for 3 to 7 days, and photographed using Zeiss
AxioObserver Z1 microscope in each well on the day
of invasion mix addition and every two days following.
Spheroids were retreated with 50 μL of vehicle control or
compound after 72 hr.
