ABSTRACT
Treatment resistance, the major challenge in the management of advanced
prostate cancer, is in part based on resistance to apoptosis. The Inhibitor of Apoptosis
(IAP) protein family is thought to play key roles in survival and drug resistance of
cancer via inhibition of apoptosis. Of the IAP family members, cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP
and survivin are known to be up-regulated in prostate cancer. BIRC6, a much less
studied IAP member, was recently shown to be elevated in castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC). In the present study, we showed a correlation between
elevated BIRC6 expression in clinical prostate cancer specimens and poor patient
prognostic factors, as well as co-upregulation of certain IAP members. In view of this,
we designed antisense oligonucleotides that simultaneously target BIRC6 and another
co-upregulated IAP member (dASOs). Two dASOs, targeting BIRC6+cIAP1 and
BIRC6+survivin, showed substantial inhibition of CRPC cell proliferation, exceeding
that obtained with single BIRC6 targeting. The growth inhibition was associated with
increased apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and suppression of NFkB activation. Moreover,
treatment with either dASO led to significantly lower viable tumor volume in vivo,
without major host toxicity. This study shows that BIRC6-based dual IAP-targeting
ASOs represent potential novel therapeutic agents against advanced prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

improve overall survival. Clearly, establishment of more
effective therapeutic targets and drugs, specifically those
targeting the molecular drivers of metastatic CRPC, is of
critical importance for improved disease management and
patient survival [5].
Apoptosis, a cell death-inducing process important
in the regulation of cell numbers in normal tissues, can
be triggered by a variety of death signals from both
extracellular and intracellular origins, and involves
activation of caspases (intracellular cysteine proteases)
that mediate the execution of apoptosis [6]. Human cancers
are characterized by resistance to apoptosis, intrinsic
or acquired, considered to be a key factor underlying
resistance to therapeutic intervention, and promising new
strategies have been developed based on drug-induced
apoptosis [7]. The treatment resistance of CRPC is thought
to be based on increased resistance to apoptosis and may

Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous
cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths for males in the Western world [1]. Prostate cancers
are initially androgen-dependent, and while androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) can induce marked tumor
regression, resistance to ADT inevitably emerges, leading
to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The current
standard care for treating CRPC is systemic, docetaxelbased chemotherapy, increasing the overall survival of
patients by about 2 months compared to mitoxantronebased therapy [2, 3]. Recently, sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel,
abiraterone, MDV3100 and Radium-223 have shown more
prolonged overall survival benefit and are approved by
the FDA for treatment of the disease [4]. However, none
of these drugs therapies are curative; they incrementally

be addressed by targeting anti-apoptotic genes and their
products [8].
The Inhibitors of Apoptosis (IAP) form a family
of functionally and structurally related proteins that
have a major role in cell death regulation. They act as
endogenous apoptosis inhibitors by binding to caspases,
thereby suppressing apoptosis initiation. The human IAP
family consists of 8 members that are characterized by
the presence of 1 to 3 baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis
repeat (BIR) motifs that are involved in the binding of
IAPs to caspases. There is increasing evidence that IAPs
also affect other cellular processes, such as ubiquitindependent signalling events that activate nuclear factor
κB (NFκB) transcription factors, which in turn drive the
expression of genes important in cellular processes such as
cell survival [9]. Due to their ability to control cell death
and elevated expression in a variety of cancer cell types,
IAP proteins are attractive targets for the development of
novel anti-cancer treatments [10]. Four IAP members, i.e.
XIAP, survivin, cIAP1 and cIAP2, have been reported
to be up-regulated in prostate cancer [11]. Survivin in
particular is promising as a potential therapeutic target for
the disease [12, 13].
The BIRC6 gene (BRUCE/APOLLON) encodes
a 528 kDa protein in mammals, consisting of a single
N-terminal BIR domain and a C-terminal ubiquitinconjugating (UBC) domain; the latter has chimeric E2/E3
ubiquitin ligase activity as well as anti-apoptotic activity
[14]. Through its BIR domain, BIRC6 protein can bind
to active caspases, including caspases-3, 6, 7 and 9 and
such interactions have been shown to underlie its ability to
inhibit the caspase cascade and ultimately apoptosis [14].
Through its UBC domain, BIRC6 facilitates proteasomal
degradation of pro-apoptotic proteins, including caspase-9
[15], SMAC/DIABLO [15, 16] and HTRA2/OMI [14,
17]. Elevated expression of BIRC6 has been found in a
variety of cancers, i.e. childhood de novo acute myeloid
leukemia [18], colorectal cancer [19], neuroblastoma
[14, 20], melanoma [21] and non-small cell lung cancer
[22]. Furthermore, BIRC6 has been implicated in
maintaining resistance against cell death stimuli [23, 24].
In contrast to other IAPs, BIRC6 has been shown to have
a cytoprotective role, essential for survival of mammalian
cells [15, 25]. BIRC6 is also known for its essential role
in regulating cytokinesis, a final event of cell division
[26]. The dual roles of BIRC6 in cell death and division
processes resemble those of survivin, and render it a
promising target for therapy of a variety of cancers [27].
We recently showed elevated expression of BIRC6
in prostate cancer cell lines and clinical specimens, and
found that increased BIRC6 expression was associated
with Gleason score 6-8 prostate cancers and CRPC,
suggesting a role for BIRC6 in prostate cancer progression
and castration resistance [28]. In the present study, we
established, using a larger cohort of clinical prostate cancer
samples, a correlation between elevated BIRC6 expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and advanced prostate cancer - evidence supporting
a role for BIRC6 in the malignant progression of the
disease. We designed antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)
that simultaneously target BIRC6 and an additional
IAP to achieve maximal anti-tumor activity, as elevated
expression in prostate cancer has also been reported for
other IAPs such as survivin and cIAP1. Promising results
have been found using in vitro and in vivo models.

RESULTS
Elevated BIRC6 protein expression is associated
with poor prognostic factors in prostate cancer
We examined whether various clinical parameters
of prostate cancer, i.e. clinical T stage, PSA recurrence,
lymph node metastasis and prostatic capsule invasion,
were associated with changes in BIRC6 protein expression.
Immunohistochemical staining of BIRC6 in prostate
cancer tissue arrays showed that BIRC6 expression was
elevated in tumors at more advanced clinical stages, i.e.
expression of BIRC6 was significantly higher in T3-4
stage tumors than in T1-2 stage tumors or benign prostate
(mean intensity ± S.E.: 1.91 ± 0.06, 1.60 ± 0.10 and 1.53 ±
0.13, respectively; Benign to T3-4, p = 0.0032; T1-2 to T34, p = 0.0059; Student’s t test) (Fig. 1A). Elevated BIRC6
expression also correlated positively with poor prognostic
factors such as PSA recurrence (Fig. 1B), lymph node
metastasis (Fig. 1C) and prostatic capsule invasion
(Fig. 1D) (p = 0.0571, 0.0286 and 0.0246, respectively,
Chi square test for trend), indicative of its association
with more advanced prostate cancer. The expression of
survivin was also elevated in prostate cancer specimens (p
= 0.004, Benign to T3-4), and correlated similar to BIRC6
with the above poor prognostic factors (p = 0.0167, PSA
recurrence; p = 0.028, capsule invasion; p = 0.006, lymph
node metastasis). Elevated XIAP expression was observed
in prostate cancer and poor prognostic factors; however,
statistical significance was not reached. No correlation was
seen in cIAP1 (Fig. S2). Taken together, the data indicate
that BIRC6, like survivin, may play a role in prostate
cancer progression.

Positive correlation between expressions of BIRC6
and other IAP members in human prostate cancer
To establish whether there was a correlation
between increases in the expression of BIRC6 in
prostate cancer and those of other IAP members, the IHC
expression profiles of BIRC6, XIAP, survivin and cIAP1
in individual clinical prostate samples (including benign
tissue, primary cancer and CRPC) were analyzed for
correlations by the Spearman’s rank correlation test using
GraphPad 4 software. The Spearman r coefficients for the

BIRC6 – survivin and BIRC6 – XIAP combinations were
0.3987 and 0.6025, respectively (p < 0.0001), indicating
positive correlations between BIRC6 and survivin, and
between BIRC6 and XIAP. A weak, but significant,
positive correlation was observed for the BIRC6 – cIAP1
combination, with a Spearman r coefficient of 0.194
(p = 0.0072). The positive correlations between the
expressions of BIRC6 and the other IAPs were visualized
by representative IHC stained images of matched patients’
samples (Fig. 1E).

As BIRC2 (cIAP1), BIRC4 (XIAP) and BIRC5
(survivin) tended to be co-upregulated in prostate cancer
in addition to BIRC6, simultaneous targeting of BIRC6
plus one of these IAP members was more likely to give
superior anti-cancer effects. Accordingly, dual-targeting
antisense oligonucleotides (dASOs), specifically targeting

combinations of BIRC6 with each of the other three IAPs,
i.e. 6w2, 6w4, 6w5, were tested for reduction of BIRC6
protein expression. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3,
only 6w2 and 6w5-1 markedly reduced BIRC6 protein
levels in prostate cancer cells. The effects of these two

dASOs on BIRC6, BIRC2 and BIRC5 protein levels were
then tested by treating PC-3 and C4-2 cells with increasing
doses of the dASOs. As shown in Figures 2A and 2B,
treatment with dASO 6w2 (100 and 200 nM) resulted in
marked, dose-dependent reductions in both BIRC6 and

cIAP1 protein expression; similarly dASO 6w5-1 (100
and 200 nM) (in the following text referred to as 6w5),
led to marked reductions in both BIRC6 and survivin
protein expressions. A time course experiment showed that
treatment of PC-3 cells with dASOs 6w2 and 6w5 resulted
in a marked reduction in BIRC6 protein expression after
48 hours of transfection, whereas reduction in cIAP1 and
survivin protein expressions by these dASOs started at 72
hours after transfection (Fig. S4).
The anti-cancer effects obtained by single and dual
targeting of IAPs were compared. At a comparable degree
of silencing of BIRC6, cIAP1 and survivin, knockdown
of each IAP alone by siRNA did not result in marked
reduction in viable PC-3 cell numbers compared to the
mock control (27.8%, -20.8% and -17.7%, respectively).
However, simultaneous silencing of BIRC6+cIAP1 and
BIRC6+survivin by 6w2 and 6w5, respectively, led to
marked reductions in the number of viable cells (49.1%
and 59.8% of suppression, respectively, p <0.001). Since
different silencing methodologies were used, i.e. siRNA
and ASO, that presumably work via different mechanisms
[29], the viabilities of cells treated with either method
were normalized using the cell viabilities obtained with
the corresponding, non-targeting controls (Fig. 2C).
The activities of 6w2 and 6w5 were more closely
examined in time course studies using cell proliferation/
viability assays. Dual silencing of BIRC6 + cIAP1 in
PC-3 cell cultures by 6w2 effectively suppressed cell
proliferation at 48, 72 and 115 hours by 77.0%, 82.4%
and 76.7%, respectively, compared to Scrambled (Scrb)
control (p<0.05). Similarly, silencing of BIRC6 + survivin
by 6w5 resulted in 74.7%, 84.1% and 78.5% growth
inhibition compared to Scrb at the same time points (p
< 0.05) (Fig. 2D). A consistent growth-inhibitory trend
was also observed using C4-2 cells and viability assays.
The growth suppressions obtained with 6w2, compared
to Scrb, at 48, 72 and 96 hours were 81.2% (p <0.001),
91.1% (p <0.01) and 99.9% (p <0.01), respectively, and
those obtained with 6w5, compared to Scrb at 48, 72
and 96 hours were 54.0% (p <0.05), 68.3% (p <0.05)
and 86.8% (p <0.01), respectively (Fig. 2E). Reductions
in BIRC6 protein expression were also observed in cells
treated with 100 and 200 nM scrambled ASO, but to a
lower extent than obtained with the targeting ASOs. For
further studies, PC-3 cells were selected due to their
higher sensitivity to BIRC6 silencing.

of early apoptotic cells generated. FACS analysis showed
that the treatments led to apoptosis of 11.3% and 16.6%
obtained with 6w2 and 6w5, respectively, compared
to 2.8% obtained with Scrb ASO (p = 6.68 x 10-5 and
0.047, respectively) (Fig. 3A, B). In addition, PC-3 cells
treated with dASOs 6w2 and 6w5 for 72 hours were
stained with DAPI and the numbers of fragmented nuclei
(a key indicator of apoptosis) were determined under a
fluorescent microscope. The percentage of cells containing
apoptotic nuclei was 24.6% and 26.5% for 6w2- and
6w5-treated cells, respectively, in contrast to 0.64% for
Scrb ASO-treated cells (Fig. 3C, D). FACS analysis of
PI-stained PC-3 cells showed that dASO 6w2 and 6w5
treatments were associated with significant increases in
the G2-M phase population [28.9% for 6w2 (p=0.008) and
30.4% for 6w5 (p=0.015)], compared to the Scrb control
(14.4%) and mock control (14.8%) (Fig. 3E, F). Increases
in S phase population were also observed in both treated
groups.
In view of a close link between IAPs and the NFkB
pathway [30, 31], the effects of dASOs 6w2 and 6w5 on
NFkB transactivation in PC-3 cells were examined using
a dual luciferase reporter assay under TNFα-induced
and non-induced conditions. The TNFα-induced NFkB
activation was markedly suppressed in dASO 6w2-treated
cells compared to cells treated with Mock (97.0%, %
suppression to mock, p = 0.003), whereas NFkB activation
was 20.2% suppressed by Scrb ASO compared to Mock. A
marked suppression of NFkB activation was also observed
in dASO 6w5-treated cells (79.0%, % of suppression to
mock, p = 0.011) (Fig. 3G). Furthermore, siRNA silencing
of BIRC6 did not reduce TNFα-induced NFkB activation,
in contrast to silencing of cIAP1 (p = 0.029 and 0.012 to
Mock and siCtrl, respectively), indicating that the dASOinduced inhibition of NFkB transactivation was not caused
by reduction of BIRC6 protein expression (Fig. S5).
Taken together, the results demonstrate that the
growth suppression of dASO 6w2- and 6w5-treated PC-3
cells was associated with apoptosis induction, G2-M
phase arrest and repression of NFkB promoter activation,
highlighting the multifaceted action of both dASOs.

dASOs suppress PC-3 xenograft growth
The therapeutic potential of the dASOs was
examined in vivo. NOD-SCID mice carrying subcutaneous
PC-3 xenografts were treated daily for 15 days with
dASOs 6w2, 6w5 or mismatched (MM) ASO (10 mg/
kg). Tumor volumes were determined at the end of the
treatment; there was no significant difference in total
volume between tumors in control and treatment groups
(Fig. 4A). However, as revealed by H&E staining,
tumors in the dASO-treated groups were found to contain
a significantly higher percentage of tumor necrosis
compared to the control group (46.67% ± 7.86 and 46.25%
± 8.17 % of necrotic area for 6w2 and 6w5 compared to

and 6w5 for 72 hours and then subjected to Annexin V and

The dASO-reduced tumor growth was associated
with a significant decrease in intratumoral BIRC6 protein
expression in both treatment groups compared to the
MM control (p = 0.026 for 6w2, p = 0.006 for 6w5) (Fig.
4D). However, no discernable reduction in the secondary
target levels cIAP1 and survivin, was detected via IHC
staining, in the tumours under the current treatment
regimen. Ki-67 staining showed that the suppressed
tumour growth was associated with a significant decrease
in the number of proliferating cells in the 6w2 treated
group (p = 0.045). 6w5 treatment was also associated with
a reduction in the number of proliferating cells although
statistical significance was not reached (Fig. 4E, F). No
significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 expression was
observed in the dASO-treated tumours at harvest (Fig.
4F). The treatment with the dASOs did not induce host
toxicity as the weights of the mice were not significantly
affected during the course of the treatment (Fig. S6);
furthermore, the treated tumors looked pallid compared
to the untreated tumors (data not shown). Taken together,
the results indicate that treatment with dASOs 6w2 and
6w5 suppressed PC-3 tumor growth in vivo without major
toxicity to the host.

delay in protein reduction. Instead, action of dASOs
appears to be the major explanation. Secondary targets are
expected to be less effectively targeted than BIRC6 due
to the presence of mismatched base pairs in the dASOs
(Fig. S1).
The very marked growth-inhibitory effects of the
6w2 and 6w5 dASOs on PC-3 and C4-2 cell proliferation
(Fig. 2D, E), and on the growth of PC-3 xenografts (Fig.
4), indicate that such dASOs are potentially useful for
treatment of advanced prostate cancer, especially since
their use did not induce major host toxicity (Fig. S6). It is
worth noting that a substantial culture growth inhibition
was obtained by treatment with 6w2 or 6w5 alone (Fig.
2D, E). This is in contrast to growth inhibition reported for
most IAP antagonists [35]. For instance, targeting cIAP1/2
and/or XIAP by Smac-mimetics alone did not induce cell
death in most cancer cell lines, but rather only enhanced
apoptosis and cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutics and
radiation [9, 36-40]. Likewise, LY2181308, a survivintargeting ASO (Eli Lilly), and AEG 35156, an XIAPtargeting ASO (Aegera Therapeutics), were shown to
effectively induce apoptosis in vitro only when combined
with gemcitabine (or paclitaxel) and TRAIL, respectively
[13, 41]. This highlights the distinctive growth-inhibitory
effect that can be obtained by the BIRC6-based, dual IAPtargeting ASOs.
The growth-suppressive effects of the dASOs may
be explained by the functional diversity of the primary
and secondary IAP targets. BIRC6 has been shown to
target pro-apoptotic molecules in the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway. In contrast, cIAP1 exerts its anti-apoptotic
activity primarily through NFkB-activated survival
signaling through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway [42],
which was not observed for BIRC6 (Fig. S5). BIRC6
is functionally different from survivin in that it targets
precursor and mature forms of caspases 9 and smac for
ubiquitin-proteosomal degradation without affecting
effector caspases [16]. Survivin, on the other hand, binds
to and suppresses the cleavage activities of activated
effector caspases 3 and 7 [43]. Accordingly, dual targeting
of BIRC6 and cIAP1 or survivin would more effectively
induce cancer cell death through acting simultaneously on
mutually exclusive pathways.
Various mechanisms appear to play a role in the
dASO-induced growth inhibition of the prostate cancer
cells. The increase in apoptosis observed in the PC-3 cell
cultures is fully expected in view of the reduction in IAP
expressions (Fig. 3A-D). Similarly, the accumulation of
cells in the G2-M phase (Fig. 3E) is consistent with the
roles reported for BIRC6 and survivin in cytokinesis [26]
[44]. The suppression of NFkB activation (Fig. 3G) can
be explained by a critical role of cIAP1 as an upstream
regulator of NFkB [45] and a regulatory role of survivin
in NFkB activation [46].
Although both dASOs demonstrated substantial
anti-cancer activity in vivo, the inhibition of secondary

DISCUSSION
Despite recent advances in prostate cancer therapy,
disease progression is still unavoidable, and treatment
resistance remains the major challenge in the management
of the disease [8, 32]. It is well accepted that treatment
resistance of cancers is largely based on resistance to
apoptosis. In particular, upregulation of inhibitors of
apoptosis proteins (IAP) is considered to be one of the
major mechanisms via which cancer cells can evade cell
death [7, 8]. In the present study, we established that
elevated expression of BIRC6 protein, a less investigated
IAP family member, is correlated with poor prognosis of
prostate cancer patients (Fig. 1A-D). This is consistent
with our previous study demonstrating that BIRC6 is
upregulated in Gleason 6-8 prostate cancers and CRPC
[28]. In addition, similar correlations were found for
survivin (Fig. S2), an IAP which has been implicated in
prostate cancer [11-13]. As such, BIRC6 represents an
attractive therapeutic target for prostate cancer.
Here we report the first therapeutic agents developed
to target BIRC6 in prostate cancers. dASOs 6w2 and 6w5
simultaneously target BIRC6 and an additional secondary
IAP target (cIAP1 or survivin). Both dASOs demonstrated
a more rapid protein knockdown of BIRC6 than either
cIAP1 or survivin in vitro (Fig. S4), suggesting a more
time-efficient knockdown of the primary target by dASOs.
The stability of protein is another contributing factor that
determines the time of protein reduction after dASO
treatment. Since cIAP1 and survivin have relatively short
half-lives, about 2.8 hours and 30 minutes, respectively
[33, 34], their stability is not likely contributing to the

targets is not as obvious as observed in vitro. This may
be due to, first, detection of protein knockdown (by IHC)
was not sensitive enough. Second, tumor cells with both
BIRC6 and cIAP1/survivin silenced could have underwent
apoptosis during the early phase of treatment, thus,
silenced cells were not captured in the current detection
window. This may also explain the lack of increased
apoptosis observed in vivo from cleaved-caspase 3 IHC
staining (Fig. 4F).
The use of second-generation ASOs, with
2’-methoxyethyl modifications in their backbone, would
greatly improve the treatment efficacy and knock-down
efficiency due to their higher tissue half-life and target
affinity [47]. Further evaluation of the therapeutic
efficacy of dual IAP-targeting ASOs using patient-derived
prostate cancer xenograft mouse models of various stages
of prostate cancer [48], and in combination with other
therapies, appear warranted.
In conclusion, the present study indicates that
BIRC6-based dual-IAP targeting ASOs may represent

Tissue microarray (TMA) construction and
immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Chemicals, solvents and solutions were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada, unless
otherwise indicated.

Prostate specimens (60 benign prostate samples,
137 primary tumors with no lymph node metastasis,
30 primary tumors with lymph node metastasis, 65
neo-adjuvant treated primary tumors, 67 CRPCs) were
obtained from the Vancouver Prostate Centre Tissue
Bank following written informed patients’ consent
and institutional study approval. All samples had been
obtained through radical prostatectomy except the CRPC
samples that were obtained through transurethral resection
of prostate (TURP). TMAs were constructed as previously
described [51]. Immunohistochemical staining using rabbit
polyclonal antibody against BIRC6 (NB110-40730, Novus
Biological, 1:50), rabbit monoclonal antibody against
Survivin (#2808, Cell Signaling, 1:50), monoclonal
antibody against cIAP1 (MAB8181, R & D Systems,
1:200) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against XIAP (#sc11426, Santa Cruz, 1:25) was conducted using a Ventana
autostainer (model Discover XT; Ventana Medical System,
Tucson, AZ) with an enzyme-labelled biotin-streptavidin
system and a solvent-resistant DAB Map kit (Ventana).
Descriptively, 0 represents no staining by any tumor cells,
1 represents a faint or focal, questionably present stain, 2

Antibodies

Dual IAP-targeting ASO design and validation

Anti-BIRC6 (Novus Biologicals, #NB110-40730)
[28], anti-survivin (71G4B7) (Cell Signaling, #2808) [49];
anti-XIAP (H-202) (#sc-11426, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA) [50]. cIAP-1/HIAP-2 antibody (R&D
Systems #MAB8181) for IHC, anti-cIAP1 (D5G9)
(#7065, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) for
Western Blotting. The same antibodies were used for
immunohistochemistry and Western blotting unless
otherwise indicated.

Dual IAP-targeting ASOs (dASOs) were designed
as 20-mers with perfect complementary matches to
BIRC6 mRNA sections and containing no more than 3
base mismatches to the second target mRNA (i.e. cIAP1
or survivin). Sequence alignment to each pair of targeted
genes was performed using Clustalw (http://www.genome.
jp/tools/clustalw/) and BLAST 2 Sequence in NCBI
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi)
to identify sequences with highest complementarities.
ASOs with full phosphorothioate-modified backbone
were purchased (Eurofins MWG Operon). The dASO
knock-down efficacy of six designed dASOs was tested
by determining target protein expression 48 hours after
transfection using Western blot analysis. Two dASO
candidates (6w2 and 6w5) were selected for further
studies: dASO 6w2 (5’CTGCAGCATCATGTGGACT)
and dASO 6w5 (5’CAGGTGAAACACTGGGACA).
Non-targeting control ASOs: Scramble (Scrb) B control
(5’CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTCCTCC), and mismatched
(MM) control (5’CAGCAGCAGAGTATTTATCAT).
Further information on dASO targeting regions and
presence of mismatches to target mRNA are shown in

METHODS
Materials

Cell lines
PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (1991, ATCC).
C4-2 cells were kindly provided by Dr. L.W.K. Chung
(1992, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tx).
They were maintained as monolayer cultures in RPMI1640 (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Prior to usage, cells
were determined to be mycoplasma free (Mycoplasma
Detection Kit, Invitrogen # rep-pt2) and were not

siRNA and ASO transfections

C4-2 cells (1 x 105) or PC-3 cells (2.5 x 104)
were seeded onto 12-well or 24-well culture plates and
transfected the next day. MTS (Promega, Madison,
MI) was added to wells at 0, 48, 72 and 96 hours after
transfection and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. Aliquots
(100 µl) of the culture medium were transferred to a 96well plate for measuring absorbance at OD490. Triplicate
wells were tested per assay and each experiment was
repeated twice.

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting cIAP1
(si-cIAP1, siGENOME SMARTpool human BIRC2),
survivin (si-Surv, siGENOME SMARTpool human
BIRC5), BIRC6 [si-BIRC6, 5’-GUU-UCA-AAG-CAGGAU-GAU-G-dTdT-3’, [52]] and negative control
(siCtrl) siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon (Cat
#M-004390-02-0005, M-003459-03-0005 and D00181010-05, Chicago, IL). Cells were transfected with siRNA
(2 nM for si-survivin and si-cIAP1, 10 nM for si-BIRC6)
or ASO (100-200 nM) for 72 hours using oligofectamin
reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Cell proliferation assay
PC-3 cells (5 x 104) were seeded onto 12-well plates
and transfected with ASOs the next day. Cell numbers
were counted at 0, 48, 72, 96 hours after transfection using
a TC10™ Automated Cell Counter (Bio-rad Laboratories,
Inc, Berkeley, CA). Triplicate wells were tested per
assay and the experiment was repeated twice. Results are
presented as percentage of untreated control values, mean
± S.D.

Western blotting
Cell lysates were prepared using cell lysis buffer
(1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholic acid) supplemented
with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Nutley, NJ).
For detection of BIRC6 (528 kDa), 10 µg whole cell
lysate was resolved in 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and
electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane in tris (25 mM),
glycine (191.5 mM), methanol (10%), SDS (0.05%)
buffer at 40V overnight at 4°C. Membranes were probed
with anti-BIRC6 antibody (1:500; Novus Biologicals) at
room temperature for 2.5 hours. For detection of cIAP1
and survivin, lysate was resolved in 10% and 15% SDSpolyacrylamide gel, respectively, and electrotransferred to
a PVDF membrane in tris (25 mM), glycine (191.5 mM),
methanol (10%) buffer at 100V for 1 hour. Membranes
were probed with anti-cIAP1 (1:500; Cell Signaling,
#7065) and anti-survivin (1:500; Cell Signaling, #2808)
antibodies at room temperature for 2.5 hours. Actin or
vinculin were used as loading controls and detected on
membranes using rabbit anti-actin polyclonal antibody
(1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich) or mouse anti-vinculin antibody
(1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich).

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow
cytometry of PI-stained cells as previously described
[28]. Cells were fixed at 72 hours after transfection. The
proportion of cells in G1, S, and G2-M phases of the cell
cycle was determined using a FlowJo program (TreeStar
Inc, Ashland, OR).4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
staining. PC-3 cells were seeded on cover slips in 12 wellplates and transfected with ASO the next day. After 72
hours of transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS
and slides were mounted using VECTASHIELD Mounting
Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, CA). Cell
morphology was examined under a fluorescent microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Germany). Cells exhibiting fragmented
nuclear bodies were considered to be undergoing
apoptosis. A total of 500 cells were counted in five
randomly selected fields per sample using a magnification
of 400x.

Annexin V assay

Dual luciferase reporter assay

Apoptosis was detected by fluorescence-activated
cell sorter (FACS) analysis with annexin-V conjugated
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Annexin-V-FITC)
(Invitrogen) and propidium iodide (PI) staining following
the manufacturer’s protocol as previously described
[28]. Early apoptotic cells were identified as Annexin-V
positive, PI negative. Data are presented as means ± SD
of triplicate experiments.

PC-3 cells (7x103) were seeded onto 96-well
plates and co-transfected the next day with 0.05 µg
pGL4.32 [luc2P/NF-kB-RE/Hygro] (# E849A, Promega
Corp., Madison, WI), 1 ng pRL-CMV (Renilla) and
100 nM dASOs or 10 nM si-BIRC6 or 2 nM si-cIAP1
using lipofectamine 2000, following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were incubated with 20 ng/ml TNFα
for 5 hours at 37°C for induction of NFκB signalling.
Luciferase activity was assessed with a Dual-luciferase
6905

Oncotarget

reporter assay system (#E1910, Promega) at 48 hours after
transfection and measured using a Tecan, Infinite 200Pro
microplate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfection
efficiency was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.
Fold induction of NFĸB signaling was calculated as
average normalized relative light units of induced cells/
average normalized relative light units of non-induced
cells. Triplicate wells were tested per assay and the
experiment was done in duplicate.

Animal studies

REFERENCES

PC-3 cells (1 x 106) were mixed with matrigel and
inoculated subcutaneously in both flanks of 6- to 8-weeksold NOD-SCID mice under isoflurane anesthesia. When
tumors reached a volume of 50-70 mm3, mice were
randomized into 3 groups (n = 12 tumors per group),
control ASO, dASO 6w2 and dASO 6w5. The ASOs were
administrated to the mice by intraperitoneal injection
once daily for 15 consecutive days at a dose of 10 mg/kg.
Tumor volume was measured on day 0 and on day 15, the
last day of treatment, using the formula: volume = (width)2
x length/2. Mice were euthanized on day 15 and tumors
fixed for immunohistochemical staining. Percentage of
tumor growth represents the change in tumor volume
measured on days 1 and 15. Viable tumor volume refers
to total tumor volume x (100% - % of necrotic area),
where % of necrotic area was determined by microscopic
examination of H&E stained sections. Scoring of BIRC6
was determined on a four-point scale as mentioned above.
Ki-67 positive cells were counted in 6-8 randomly selected
fields (40x magnification) and results are presented as
percentage of cells with Ki-67 positive nuclei compared
to the total number of cells.

Comparisons of two groups were made using
the Student t test. Analyses of correlations between
IAP members were performed using a Spearman nonparametric test. Analyses of correlation between BIRC6
expression trend and various prognostic factors were
carried out using the Chi square test for trend. Statistical
analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0
(GraphPad). Results with a p<0.05 were considered
significant.
