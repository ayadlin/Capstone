Summary

Introduction

The recent discovery that normal and neoplastic epithelial cells re-enter the stem-cell state raised
an intriguing possibility in the context of cancer pathogenesis: the aggressiveness of carcinomas
derives not from their existing content of cancer stem cells (CSCs), but from their proclivity to
generate new CSCs from non-CSC populations. Here we demonstrate that non-CSCs of human
basal breast cancers are plastic cell populations that readily switch from a non-CSC to CSC-state.
The observed cell plasticity is dependent on ZEB1, a key regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition. We find plastic non-CSCs maintain the ZEB1 promoter in a bivalent chromatin
configuration enabling them to respond readily to microenvironmental signals, such as TGFbeta.
In response, the ZEB1 promoter converts from a bivalent to active chromatin configuration, ZEB1
transcription increases and non-CSCs subsequently enter the CSC state. Our findings support a
dynamic model where interconversions between low and high tumorigenic states occur frequently,
thereby increasing tumorigenic and malignant potential.

Metastatic dissemination and disease relapse are critical determinants of cancer prognosis.
The mechanisms underlying both processes remain poorly understood. Recent advances in
understanding cellular hierarchies present within a variety of tumors have changed our
perspective of neoplastic cell population organization. In particular, cell-surface antigen
markers have revealed distinct subpopulations of neoplastic cells within tumors showing
pronounced differences in tumor-initiating and metastatic powers (Visvader and Lindeman,

2012). Such evidence indicates that within individual tumors, genetically identical cancer
cells may nonetheless reside in distinct phenotypic states.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Importantly, tumors derived from implanting highly tumorigenic subpopulations of cells
exhibit the phenotypic heterogeneity of their predecessor tumors, in that they contain both
highly and weakly tumorigenic cells (Visvader and Lindeman, 2012). Implicit is the notion
that highly tumorigenic cells can self-renew and also divide asymmetrically into daughter
cells with low tumorigenic potential. Parallels identified with cell hierarchies operating in
normal adult tissues have led to coining of the term “cancer stem cell” (CSC) to describe the
subset of neoplastic cells that reside in a highly tumorigenic state.
The simplest depiction would portray CSCs as residing at the apex of a cellular hierarchy
and spawning, in a unidirectional manner, more differentiated non-CSC progeny. Cells in a
number of cancer types conform to that model (Bonnet and Dick, 1997; Visvader and
Lindeman, 2012). These studies imply that once a CSC has exited the CSC state it cannot reenter it. This principle of unidirectionality holds great importance given the significance of
CSCs for cancer development and, quite possibly, progression to metastatic disease.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A small number of studies now suggest that not all cancers strictly conform to the
unidirectional hierarchical CSC model. We and others have recently demonstrated that nonCSCs can acquire CSC-like activity under certain conditions (Chaffer et al., 2011; Gupta et
al., 2011; Roesch et al., 2010). These studies open the door to the possibility that there is
likely to be greater plasticity in cancer cell populations – yielding bi-directional
interconversions between CSC and non-CSC states – than is depicted in the simplest version
of the CSC model.
It has remained unclear whether these interconversions are confined to specific types of
cancer, how frequently they occur in vivo, and how they are achieved mechanistically. These
interconversions are potentially important for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy, given
the now-extensive evidence that CSCs are intrinsically more prone to disseminate and, at the
same time, exhibit resistance to many existing anti-tumor therapies (Dean et al., 2005;
Malanchi et al., 2012). In the present study, we aimed to address the role of non-CSC-toCSC conversions by determining their frequency in a cohort of breast cancer (BrCa) cell
lines.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In fact, we find that non-CSC-to-CSC conversions occur frequently in certain subtypes of
BrCa but not in others, and have uncovered a mechanism governing this transition. From a
therapeutic standpoint, the plasticity that we describe suggests efforts to improve therapeutic
outcome for cancer patients by specifically targeting CSCs must be further enhanced by
coupling them with strategies designed to eliminate non-CSC-to-CSC interconversions or, at
the very least, to eliminate the subpopulations of non-CSCs that are poised to become CSCs.

CD44 status and tumorigenic potential
Cell surface antigens, such as CD44, CD24 and ESA, have been successfully used to isolate
CSC-like populations from BrCa cell lines and primary tissues. Among these antigens, it is
widely accepted that breast CSCs are contained exclusively in the CD44hi cell compartment
(Al-Hajj et al., 2003; Fillmore and Kuperwasser, 2008; Mani et al., 2008; Visvader and
Lindeman, 2012).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test the notion that CD44hi status, on its own, would allow enrichment of CSCs from
BrCa cell lines, we analyzed 5 basal BrCa lines (SUM149, SUM159, HCC38, HMLER and
BPLER) and 3 luminal BrCa lines (MCF7, MCF7R and T47D). (In the clinic, luminal BrCa
generally are less aggressive and hold a better prognosis, while basal BrCa behave in the
opposite fashion). CD44hi and CD44lo populations were evident to various extents in all
basal BrCa lines examined, while all luminal BrCa lines consisted only of CD44lo
populations (Figure S1A, and data not shown). To compare the relative tumorigenic
potentials of these subpopulations, we purified by FACS CD44lo fractions from the luminal
lines and CD44lo and CD44hi populations from the basal lines. Purified populations were
injected immediately into the mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice. In all these
experiments, cell populations were only implanted in hosts if they were greater than 99.7%
pure as judged by FACS (Figure S1A-C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We found that CD44lo luminal lines required higher cell numbers and longer incubation
times in vivo to generate tumors of equivalent size to those seeded by purified CD44lo basal
lines (luminal: 1×106 cells and 12-16 weeks in vivo; basal: 5×105 cells and 6-10 weeks in
vivo, Figure 1A and Table S1). In addition, basal CD44hi-derived tumors were 3-40 fold
larger than their CD44lo counterparts when equal cell numbers were injected (Figure 1A and
Table S2). Limiting dilution analysis showed that basal CD44hi cell fractions were
significantly enriched for CSC frequency compared to their CD44lo counterparts (∼10-fold,
Figure S1D and Table S3). These data demonstrate that CD44hi expression enriches for cells
that naturally reside in basal BrCa cell lines and possess higher intrinsic tumor-initiating and
growth potential. Moreover, they raised the question of how certain BrCa populations that
apparently lacked all traces of tumor-initiating CSCs were able to generate tumors when
injected into host mice.
CD44hi CSCs arising from basal CD44lo cell populations in vivo
In previous work, we demonstrated that non-CSCs derived from experimentally transformed
human mammary basal epithelial cells (HMECs) could spontaneously generate de novo
CSCs both in vitro and in vivo (Chaffer et al., 2011). In the present work, we first undertook
to test the idea that non-CSC-to-CSC conversions occur frequently in a broad array of BrCa
cell lines.
Accordingly, we used FACS to analyze the tumors described above that arose from basal or
luminal CD44lo cells. We found that luminal CD44lo–derived tumors comprised almost
entirely CD44lo cells with a small but detectable subpopulation (avg. <0.32%) of CD44hi
cells. This suggested that luminal BrCa cells apparently lacking CD44hi tumor-initiating

cells were nonetheless able to seed tumors by generating new CD44hi cells, albeit at a low
frequency. In marked contrast to the behavior of luminal cells, basal CD44lo-derived tumors
contained CD44hi subpopulations ranging in size from 2-22% of tumor cells (Figure 1B).
These findings indicated that basal CD44lo populations efficiently generate CD44hi
populations in vivo, while luminal CD44lo populations do so with dramatically lower
efficiency.
Functional analysis of CD44hi cells created in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next sought to demonstrate that CD44hi cells arising in vivo from basal CD44lo cells
were functionally equivalent to CSCs that are naturally present in basal BrCa cell lines. To
begin, we derived several cell lines from tumors arising from implanted CD44lo basal cells
(SUM149-, SUM159- and BPLER-CD44lo tumors) depicted in Figure 1A, terming them
ExV (reflecting their ex vivo derivation). Each of these tumor-derived ExV-cell lines
contained both CD44lo and CD44hi cells (Figure 1B), which we termed ExV-CD44lo and
ExV-CD44hi cells. We then used FACS to isolate pure (>99%) populations of ExV-CD44lo
and ExV-CD44hi cells and immediately injected them orthotopically into NOD/SCID mice
(Figure 1C and Figure S1E-G). In most cases, ExV-CD44hi cells generated 13-23 fold larger
tumors compared to their ExV-CD44lo counterparts (SUM159 and BPLER ExV lines), and
displayed increased tumor-initiating ability (SUM159 and SUM149 ExV lines) (Figure 1C
and Table S4). These results illustrate that CD44hi cells arising in vivo from basal CD44lo
cells behave much like the CSCs that are naturally present in basal BrCa cell populations, in
that they exhibit elevated tumor-initiating and tumor growth potential relative to their
CD44lo counterparts.
ZEB1 drives CD44lo-to-CD44hi cellular plasticity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We then undertook to shed light on the mechanism(s) enabling the observed in vivo CD44loto-CD44hi conversions. Given the inherent difficulties of uncovering these mechanisms in
an in vivo setting, we first sought mechanistic insights from an in vitro model system that we
had previously developed, in which non-transformed basal mammary epithelial cells (HMEflopc cells) spontaneously undergo CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions with high frequency
(Chaffer et al., 2011). As demonstrated at the time, conversions of non-transformed
immortalized human mammary epithelial cells closely paralleled the behavior of their
corresponding transformed derivatives.
In this instance, we also drew from earlier work demonstrating that CD44hi stem-like cells
are more mesenchymal than their CD44lo counterparts (Chaffer et al., 2011; Mani et al.,
2008). This and subsequent work (Guo et al., 2012) demonstrated that passage through the
cell-biological program termed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) placed cells
close to the epithelial stem cell (SC) state. (This EMT program is largely studied for its
ability to confer mesenchymal traits on epithelial cells.) Accordingly, we purified CD44lo
and CD44hi subpopulations from HME-flopc cells and confirmed that CD44hi cells, which
contained the SC-like cells, indeed resided in a more mesenchymal state than their more
epithelial CD44lo counterparts (Figure 2A). Subsequently, to identify a key mediator of nonCSC-to-CSC plasticity, we analyzed the expression of various transcription factors (EMT-

TFs) known to govern the EMT program. Here we found that ZEB1 expression was
significantly higher (∼10-fold) in CD44hi compared to CD44lo cells (Figure 2B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether ZEB1 contributed in a critical way to mediating the transition from
the CD44lo to CD44hi state, we analyzed CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions in HME-flopcCD44lo cells expressing either doxycycline-inducible control or ZEB1-targeted shRNAs. We
first confirmed that, following doxycycline-mediated induction, each of these shRNA
vectors was capable, on its own, of achieving 80 to 90% ZEB1 knockdown (ZEB1-kd) in
CD44hi cells. We also noted no differences in cell proliferation between cell populations
expressing the control shRNA and those expressing shRNAs targeting ZEB1 mRNA (Figure
S2A-B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We proceeded to purify CD44lo cells expressing the various shRNA vectors by FACS,
introduced them into 2D cultures, and used FACS to monitor resulting cultures propagated
in the presence or absence of doxycycline over the next 16 days. In the continued presence
of doxycycline, the ability of CD44lo ZEB1-kd cells to convert into the CD44hi state was
reduced by 75% (sh1) and 67% (sh2) relative to cultures expressing the control shRNA
(Figure 2C). However, when doxycycline was withdrawn at day 8, permitting cells to
continue growing in the absence of doxycycline for an additional 8 days, FACS analysis
showed that CD44lo ZEB1-kd cells soon regained their ability to convert to the CD44hi state
(Figure 2C). As such, the ability of CD44lo cells to activate ZEB1 expression appeared to be
an important determinant of their ability to enter into the CD44hi state and thus an important
determinant of cell plasticity in this model system.
Modulation of CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions by the MIR200 family

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The expression of the ZEB1 gene is tightly regulated by an interactive network involving
ZEB1 itself, its relative ZEB2, and members of the MIR200 family of microRNAs (Gregory
et al., 2008; Wellner et al., 2009). Thus, ZEB1 can serve to repress expression of the
MIR200 miRNAs, while the latter can inhibit both the function and/or reduce the stability of
the mRNAs specifying ZEB1 and ZEB2; hence, these mutually antagonistic elements
constitute a circuit that operates as a bi-stable switch, governing the residence of cells in
either the mesenchymal or epithelial state. Accordingly, we confirmed that ZEB1-kd in our
system resulted in a decrease in ZEB2 mRNA and concomitant increases in MIR200B and
MIR200C levels (Figure S2A and S4).
In light of the mutually antagonistic actions of ZEB1 and the MIR200 miRNAs, we
determined whether addition of synthetic inhibitors or mimetics (chemically synthesized,
single-stranded, modified RNAs) influenced spontaneous CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions in
HME-flopc-CD44lo cells. Indeed, as we found, miR200b or miR200c inhibitors significantly
increased the rate of CD44lo to CD44hi conversions (Figure 2D).
We next undertook to determine whether the ability of the MIR200 family to affect CD44loto-CD44hi conversions derived largely from modulation of ZEB1 transcript levels or,
alternatively, from the involvement of other MIR200 targets. Here we found that in the
presence of ZEB1-kd, the miR200c inhibitor was unable to provoke a CD44lo-to-CD44hi
conversion (Figure 2E).

Together, these various results highlighted two important points: 1) ZEB1 is a key mediator
of spontaneous CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions in non-transformed HMECs, acting through
repression of the MIR200 family and, quite possibly, other still-unidentified targets; and 2)
MIR200 family modulation of CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversion derives from effects on ZEB1
mRNA levels.
We extended these observations by examining the consequences of ZEB1 knockdown in
HME-flopc-CD44lo cells that had previously been transformed with SV40-Early Region and
oncogenic RAS in vitro (Figure 2F). We found similar dynamics observed previously in the
untransformed HME-flopc cells operated in their transformed derivatives.
Together, these results demonstrated ZEB1 is a key mediator of CD44lo-to-CD44hi
conversions in both non-transformed and transformed HMECs in vitro, and supported the
previously reported notion that the dynamics of epithelial versus mesenchymal plasticity are
quite similar in hTERT-immortalized cells and their transformed derivatives (Chaffer et al.,
2011).
ZEB1/MIR200c are differentially expressed in BrCa cell populations

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether ZEB1 often functions as a key player in driving BrCa cell plasticity,
we assessed whether ZEB1 and MIR200 expression was indicative of the CD44lo versus
CD44hi state in a broader array of BrCa lines. To do so, we first analyzed ZEB1 protein
expression in luminal, basal CD44lo, and basal CD44hi BrCa cell lines. ZEB1 was not
detected in all luminal lines; however, in basal BrCa cell lines, ZEB1 was detectable in both
populations, being 4-fold higher in matched pairs of CD44hi compared to CD44lo cells
(Figure 3A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the tight regulatory loop between ZEB1 and the MIR200 family, we next examined
how ZEB1 protein levels are regulated in these BrCa cell lines. Accordingly, we analyzed
ZEB1, MIR200B and MIR200C mRNA expression levels. We found luminal lines expressed
very low levels of ZEB1 mRNA and very high levels of MIR200B/C. Conversely, basal
CD44lo cells generally expressed modest but nonetheless detectable levels of both ZEB1
mRNA and MIR200B/C whereas basal CD44hi cells expressed high levels of ZEB1 mRNA
and low-to-absent MIR200B/C levels (Figure 3B-C). We further confirmed that these
patterns of ZEB1 and MIR200B/C differential expression were maintained in the basal ExVCD44lo and ExV-CD44hi cell populations (Figure S3A).
These observations demonstrated that, as predicted from their known interactions, the
expression of ZEB1 and MIR200B/C varies inversely in these various BrCa cell lines, and
that the ZEB1 EMT-TF is expressed at far higher levels in basal BrCa cells, which represent
a class of tumors that generally carry worse clinical prognosis. Moreover, they indicated that
the expression pattern initially observed in the HME-flopc cells lines was closely echoed by
the human basal BrCa lines examined.
Role of ZEB1-mediated CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions in tumor initiation and growth
The data implicating ZEB1 in CD44lo-to-CD44hi cell plasticity in vitro did not shed light on
whether it plays a similar role in vivo, specifically in basal BrCa cells. Consequently, we

introduced the same doxycycline-inducible control or ZEB1-targeted shRNAs used earlier
into cell populations of the HCC38 and SUM159 human breast cancer cell lines and the
experimentally transformed HMLER cells (Figure S3B). We confirmed that ZEB1-kd
achieved in the presence of doxycycline did not affect cell proliferation rates in monolayer
culture (Figure S3C). FACS-purified CD44lo populations of control or doxycycline-induced
ZEB1-kd cells were then injected orthotopically into NOD/SCID mice immediately
following FACS-purification in order to analyze the effects of ZEB1-kd on CD44lo-toCD44hi conversions in vivo and on tumorigenicity. Animals were administered doxycycline
(2g/1L) for the duration of the experiment.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Strikingly, HMLER-CD44lo cells gave rise to tumors of 0.1g on average after 8-10 weeks of
growth in vivo, while their ZEB1-kd counterparts failed to form tumors (Figure 3D),
indicating that ZEB1-mediated CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions were essential for tumorinitiating potential. That is, the ability of HMLER-CD44lo carcinoma cells to initiate tumors
appeared to depend critically on the ability of these cells to spontaneously generate CSCs in
vivo, which depended in turn on their ability to activate expression of their own endogenous
ZEB1 gene. Similar results were obtained with HCC38-CD44lo cells. In SUM159-CD44lo
ZEB1-kd cells, tumor size was significantly decreased (0.39g average for controls; 0.03g
and 0.18g on average for sh1 and sh2 respectively), and tumor-initiating potential was
decreased from 100% in control cells to 67% in ZEB1-kd cells. Together, these data
demonstrate that the ability of CD44lo basal BrCa cell populations to up-regulate ZEB1
expression is generally a critical determinant of their tumor-initiating potential and overall
tumor growth.
Role of ZEB1 in the CD44hi stem-cell state
Given the importance of ZEB1 in enabling spontaneous CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions, we
wondered whether the continued expression of ZEB1 was required thereafter for
maintenance of the resulting CD44hi cell state; alternatively, other regulatory loops might
become activated that then obviate the need for high ZEB1 expression for initial entrance
into the CD44hi state. Accordingly, we used FACS to monitor the ability of purified
nontransformed HME-flopc-CD44hi cells to maintain their CD44hi marker profile in culture
over a 16 day period in the presence or absence of ZEB1-kd. Interestingly, we found that
CD44hi ZEB1-kd cells maintained their CD44hi marker profile (Figure 4A and S4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next we functionally tested the SC activity of CD44hi ZEB1-kd cells by mammosphereforming ability in 3D culture (Dontu et al., 2003). We found mammosphere formation was
reduced by 80-99% compared to control. Furthermore, addition of miR200 inhibitors to
CD44hi ZEB1-kd cells could not restore mammosphere-forming ability (Figure 4B).
Together, these data demonstrate that ZEB1 is required for initial acquisition of both CD44hi
expression and stem-like activity of CD44hi cells and subsequent maintenance of SC
activity, but is not required for long-term maintenance of high cell-surface CD44 expression.
We further examined the effect of ZEB1-kd in HME-flopc-CD44hi cells that had been
transformed by the introduction of SV40-Early Region and oncogenic RAS genes, i.e., the
HMLER-flopc cells. Similarly, FACS analysis confirmed that transformed CD44hi ZEB1-kd
cells maintained their CD44hi phenotype (data not shown). We also observed that ZEB1-kd

decreased tumorsphere formation, an in vitro surrogate measure of CSC-like activity (60%
inhibition, p<0.003), and significantly reduced tumor burden in vivo (p<0.05) (Figure 4CD).
To summarize, together with our earlier results, these showed that ZEB1 is required for
conversion from the CD44lo to CD44hi state and also for maintenance of CD44hi stem-like/
CSC-like activity. Once cells are residing in the CD44hi state, however, ZEB1 and CD44
expression can be uncoupled, in that cells with ZEB1-kd functionally lose their stemlike/CSC features while still maintaining high CD44 expression. Stated differently, these
data suggest that CD44hi cells can constitute heterogeneous cell populations, in which
CD44hiZEB1+ signifies great enrichment of cells residing in a CSC-like state, whereas
CD44hiZEB1- signifies cells that are non-CSCs.
Phenotypic plasticity and chromatin configuration of the ZEB1 promoter

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The above-described experiments provided clear indication that ZEB1 function is necessary
for the generation of CD44hi stem-like cells from CD44lo cells. Still, these observations did
not provide insight into why ZEB1 was readily induced in basal CD44lo cells but not in
luminal CD44lo cells. We reasoned that current models of epigenetic regulation might
illuminate these differences in behavior, as global epigenetic differences have been observed
between luminal and basal-type BrCa (Maruyama et al., 2011). More specifically, we chose
to use chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative real-time PCR (ChIP-qPCR)
to examine the chromatin state at the ZEB1 promoter.
The functional state of chromatin has been defined largely by patterns of covalent
modifications to the N-terminal domains of histones and is indicative of transcriptional
activity. Thus, trimethylation of lysine 4 of the histone H3 subunit (H3K4me3) is associated
with transcriptional initiation (Guenther et al., 2007), dimethylation of lysine 79 of the same
subunit (H3K79me2) is associated with transcriptional elongation (Mueller et al., 2007), and
the combination of H3K4me3 and H3K79me2 indicates an actively transcribed gene. In
contrast, trimethylation of lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is often associated with transcriptional
repression mediated by the Polycomb group of proteins (Cao et al., 2002; Czermin et al.,
2002; Kuzmichev et al., 2002; Muller et al., 2002).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In embryonic stem (ES) cells, the promoters of many genes encoding key developmental
regulators are associated with both the permissive H3K4me3 and the restrictive H3K27me3
modifications (yielding so-called ‘bivalent’ domains) (Bernstein et al., 2006). This bivalent
chromatin is thought to keep these genes repressed, but nonetheless poised for rapid
transcriptional activation in response to subsequent signaling decisions favoring
differentiation. These findings indicate that this combination of histone modifications may
be a signature of regulators that are required to rapidly switch cell state. Indeed, through
publically available databases we determined that ZEB1 maintains a bivalent chromatin
configuration in ES cells (Figure S5A).
We speculated that ZEB1 might exhibit a bivalent chromatin state in those cells in which it
was possible to switch between low and high ZEB1 expression. To pursue this notion, we
first analyzed purified CD44lo or CD44hi HME-flopc populations. CD44hi cells displayed

chromatin methylation patterns indicating active transcription at the ZEB1 promoter as
determined by the presence of both H3K4me3 and H3K79me2 marks (Figure 5A-B). In
contrast, we found that CD44lo cells exhibited bivalent chromatin methylation patterns at the
ZEB1 promoter, as determined by the presence of both H3K4me3, and H3K27me3. These
data indicated that immortalized untransformed basal mammary epithelial cells with the
ability to spontaneously switch to a CD44hi stem-like state do indeed maintain their ZEB1promoter in a poised, bivalent configuration.
We wished to extend these observations to human BrCa cell lines, including luminal, basal
CD44lo and basal CD44hi cell populations. Our previous data had shown that luminal cell
lines express very low levels of ZEB1 mRNA (Figure 3A-B). Perhaps unsurprisingly, we
found that all luminal cell lines exhibited only repressive chromatin methylation patterns at
ZEB1, as determined by the presence of H3K27me3 and the relative absence of both
H3K4me3 and H3K79me2 (Figure 5C). Further, we found that the chromatin at the ZEB1
promoter in basal CD44hi cells is characterized by the presence of H3K4me3 and
H3K79me2 and the relative absence of H3K27me3, indicating active transcription. These
chromatin modifications conform with our earlier expression data indicating that all basal
CD44hi cells express high levels of ZEB1 (Figure 3A-C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Provocatively, we found that the ZEB1 promoter in basal CD44lo BrCa cells resided in a
bivalent chromatin state, where both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications were
detected, much as we had found in the immortalized CD44lo HME cells. To demonstrate
that both histone modifications reside simultaneously in specific regions in the basal CD44lo
BrCa cells, we performed sequential-ChIP analysis for H3K4me3 followed by H3K27me3
ChIP, as well as the reverse ChIP experiment (Figure S5B). Together, these results
demonstrate that both immortalized and neoplastic basal CD44lo populations maintain ZEB1
in a unique bivalent chromatin state, poised for activation, and provided a mechanistic
insight as to why ZEB1 is readily induced in basal CD44lo cells but not in luminal CD44lo
cells, which maintain the ZEB1 promoter in a repressed state.
Microenvironmental stimuli and CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Extensive evidence indicates that activation of the EMT program and entrance into a stem
cell state is generally triggered by contextual signals received by normal and neoplastic
epithelial cells (Mani et al., 2008; Thiery et al., 2009). Among these signals, TGFbeta has
been shown to potently upregulate ZEB1 expression (Gregory et al., 2011). Accordingly, we
examined whether TGFbeta could enhance the spontaneous CD44lo-to-CD44hi transitions of
immortalized HMECs. Indeed, TGFbeta induced a dose-dependent increase, while the
SB431542 TGFbeta receptor inhibitor inhibited such conversions. In the context of ZEB1kd, however, the ability of TGFbeta to induce transitions was abolished (Figure 6A and
S6A-B). Similarly, we also found that transformed HME-flopc-CD44lo cells could not
transition from the CD44lo to CD44hi state in response to TGFbeta if ZEB1 expression was
inhibited (Figure 6B). Hence, TGFbeta can enhance CD44lo-to-CD44hi transitions in both
normal and transformed cells in a fashion that is dependent upon induction of ZEB1.
To further confirm that TGFbeta-driven CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions were achieved
through ZEB1, we showed that ZEB1 mRNA was induced and inhibited by TGFbeta and

SB431542 treatment respectively (Figure S6C). As controls, we found that TGFbeta target
genes (PAI-1 and GADD45B) were induced and repressed in these cells in response to
modulation of TGFbeta signaling (Figure S6C), confirming that overall TFGbeta signaling
operated in these cells as anticipated.
We extended these findings to a series of human BrCa cell lines and speculated that basal
CD44lo cells, but not luminal CD44lo cells, would readily transit to a CD44hi state in
response to TGFbeta. To test this notion, luminal (MCF7Ras and ZR-75-1) and basal
(HMLER and HCC38) CD44lo cells were treated for 4 days with TGFbeta (2 or 20 ng/ml).
FACS analysis at Day 4 showed that the luminal cells did not generate any CD44hi cells in
response to TGFbeta treatment, while the basal CD44lo cells responded in a dose-dependent
manner to TGFbeta by generating CD44hi cells (Figure 6C). We further demonstrate that
TGFbeta stimulation led to an increase in ZEB1 protein levels (Figure S6E). Together, these
data indicate that one important contextual signal - TGFbeta - enhances the rate of CD44loto-CD44hi transitions in basal breast cancer CD44lo cell populations, and that this response
is dependent upon induction of ZEB1 expression.
Modulation of the chromatin status at the ZEB1 promoter by TGFbeta

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Having shown that TGFbeta induces CD44lo-to-CD44hi conversions in basal CD44lo cells,
we examined whether this effect coincided directly with changes in the histone modification
patterns at the ZEB1 promoter. To do so, we performed ChiP-qPCR on basal HME-flopcCD44lo cells expressing doxycycline-inducible ZEB1-shRNA treated with Control (HCl),
TGFbeta (2ng/ml) or the SB431542 TGFbeta receptor inhibitor (10 μM).
Performing this experiment in a ZEB1-kd intracellular environment was essential in order to
maintain a homogeneous CD44lo population; otherwise, TGFbeta treatment would cause the
CD44lo cells to transition to a CD44hi state, in which case, the CD44hi cells harboring active
histone modifications at the ZEB1 promoter would mask any changes occurring specifically
in CD44lo cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ZEB1 knockdown in basal CD44lo cells was induced by exposure to doxycycline for 5 days
and cells were subsequently treated with TGFbeta, SB431542, or control (PBS or DMSO).
After a further 5 days in the continued presence of doxycycline, FACS analysis confirmed
that the CD44lo-ZEB1-kd cells remained as pure CD44lo populations (Figure 6D)
We then performed ChIP-qPCR at the ZEB1 promoter to compare changes in the levels of
histone modifications in control versus TGFbeta or SB531542 treatment. While no
significant differences in the H3K4me3 or H3K79me2 methylation patterns were observed
across all treatment groups, we found that TGFbeta treatment did indeed lead to a marked
decrease in the repressive H3K27me3 mark associated with the ZEB1 promoter in basal
CD44lo cells (Figure 6E). Together, these data demonstrate that TGFbeta enables cells to
transition from the bivalent chromatin status to active chromatin state at the ZEB1 promoter,
doing so, at least in part, through the removal of the H3K27me3 repressive mark.
Wishing to put into context these changes in the histone modifications at the ZEB1
promoter, we also followed changes in histone marks following control, TGFbeta or

SB531542 treatment at the promoters of two TGFbeta-responsive genes (GADD45B, PAI-1)
and a TGFbeta-non-responsive gene (HPRT1). We found that the magnitude of changes in
histone modifications causing active transcription at known TGFbeta target genes closely
correlated with the changes that we had previously observed at the ZEB1 promoter in
response to TGFbeta treatment (Figure S6D). These provide further evidence that ZEB1 is a
bona fide TGFbeta target gene in these cells.
Intrinsic responsiveness of luminal BrCa cells to exogenous ZEB1

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Knowing that luminal cells are indeed responsive to TGFbeta treatment (as determined by
TGFbeta-mediated up-regulation of pSMAD2 (Figure S6E)), we reasoned that the inability
of luminal cells to undergo a CD44lo-to-CD44hi switch in response to TGFbeta treatment
might be due to their inability to activate ZEB1 transcription or, quite possibly, to an
intrinsic lack of responsiveness of these cells to ZEB1 signaling. To explore these
alternatives, we forced expression of ZEB1 in MCF7Ras cells (Figure S6F). We observed a
progressively increasing population of CD44hi cells in MCF7R-ZEB1 cells over a 2-week
time course (Figure 6F). Furthermore, we found that ZEB1 overexpression increased
tumorsphere formation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 6G-H). These data indicate that while the endogenous ZEB1 promoter in these
luminal cells is repressed, they are nevertheless intrinsically responsive to this EMT-TF if its
expression is forced.
Assessment of ZEB1 and MIR200B/C in clinical cases of breast cancer
As described above, we found that ZEB1 pays an important role in promoting CD44lo-toCD44hi conversions and in maintaining the CSC-like state in cells that already reside in the
CD44hi state. Indeed, both of these processes contribute to enhanced tumor initiation and
growth. We were interested in relating these observations to the properties of clinical cases
of breast cancer. To pursue this question, we accessed data from the Cancer Genome Atlas
Network (CGAN, 2012).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We first assessed the relative abundance of MIR200 family members across all breast
tumors represented in the CGAN database and found that MIR200C accounts for 93%
(sd=5%) of mature miRNA in the MIR200BC family, with minority representation of the
related MIR200B (6%) and MIR429 (1%) family members (Figure 7A); given the dominant
presence of MIR200C over its other family members, this allowed us to focus subsequent
measurements on levels of MIR200C. We also found that the levels of ZEB1 and MIR200C
expression are inversely correlated in basal (p=9.4×10-4; r2=0.13), luminal A (p=2.8×10-4;
r2=0.07) and luminal B (p=6.8×10-4; r2=0.12) subtypes but not in HER2-overexpressing
BrCa cells (Figure 7B). We then compared the absolute abundance of ZEB1 and MIR200C
in BrCa subtypes and found that surprisingly, in contrast to the observations described
above, ZEB1 mRNA appeared to be significantly more abundant in normal and luminal A
BrCa subtypes compared to the basal subtype (Figure 7C).
Given our earlier observations in cultured cells that luminal BrCa lines do not express ZEB1
and that the chromatin at the ZEB1 promoter resides in a repressed state in those same lines,
we reasoned that this apparent conflict with the relatively high levels of ZEB1 and MIR200C

mRNA in clinical cases of Luminal A-type BrCa might be explained in either of two ways:
our studies of cultured cancer cell lines failed to properly reflect the behavior of
corresponding cells in living tissues, or the data in the CGAN database was confounded by
strong contamination of carcinoma cells with adjacent stromal cells expressing high levels
of ZEB1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To resolve between these alternatives, we analyzed ZEB1 protein expression in a tissue
microarray of breast cancer biopsies (Figure 7D and Figure S7). We found that ZEB1
protein is present at high levels in the stromata of all breast cancer subtypes. Interestingly,
however, comparison of ZEB1 protein specifically in cancer cells showed that triplenegative (TN) BrCa cells have significantly higher levels of ZEB1 protein compared to
Luminal A cancer cells (Figure 7D, p = 0.017). In fact, ZEB1 was not present in the
carcinoma cells of any Luminal A BrCa sample examined (0/91 samples). From these data,
we concluded that the strong ZEB1-positive signature produced by the TCGA analysis data
in Luminal A BrCa compared to TN BrCa (Figure 7C) was entirely attributable to stromal
cells present as significant contaminants in the Luminal A samples. Our data further
highlight the difficulty of interpreting such global genomic analyses performed on whole
tumor digests, where the relative representations of both carcinoma cells and stromal cells
cannot be accounted for.
Together with our demonstration in BrCa cell lines that ZEB1 is the driver of the de novo
generation of CSCs from non-CSC cell populations, the high expression of ZEB1 in TN
BrCa cells raises the possibility that the more aggressive nature of clinical TN-type BrCa
compared to Luminal-type BrCa may be, in part, attributable to the ability of TN BrCas to
readily activate ZEB1 expression in response to microenvironmental stimuli and
subsequently, to create a continuous source of highly tumorigenic CSCs.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The present work reveals that the dynamics of interconversion between epithelial non-CSC
and mesenchymal/CSC states are important determinants of normal and neoplastic epithelial
tissue behavior. In contrast to the widely accepted CSC model, where CSCs give rise to nonCSC progeny in a unidirectional manner, we have demonstrated that in certain carcinoma
subtypes, notably basal carcinomas of the breast, neoplastic cells can readily convert from a
CD44lo to a CD44hi state (Figure 7E). Given the strong enrichment of CSCs in the CD44hi
state and their virtual absence in CD44lo cells (Al-Hajj et al., 2003), this suggested an
interconversion between non-CSCs and CSCs, as indeed we demonstrated directly.
Our analyses indicate that this plasticity is not a universal property of all breast carcinomas.
Plastic behavior was associated with 4/5 basal-type BrCa cell lines, while luminal CD44lo
populations (4/4) were extremely inefficient at switching from the CD44lo-to-CD44hi
phenotype. These findings demonstrate fundamental differences in the biology driving
basal-versus luminal- type tumors and suggest that the well-documented aggressive behavior
of basal-type BrCa's may be traced, in no small part, to this plasticity and the associated
ability to generate carcinoma cells with enhanced tumor-initiating powers. The discovery of
ZEB1, a well-characterized EMT-TF, as a key mediator of CD44lo-to-CD44hi plasticity is

consistent with the idea that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition generates cells with CSClike activity (Mani et al., 2008; Morel et al., 2008). While we do not rule out the possibility
that other EMT transcription factors functioning upstream of ZEB1 may also drive nonCSC-to-CSC conversions, we have demonstrated that ZEB1 plays a critical, rate-limiting
role in governing basal BrCa cell plasticity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We found that the chromatin configuration associated with the ZEB1 promoter in luminal
CD44lo cells was repressed, while in basal CD44lo cells it was maintained in a bivalent/
poised configuration, corresponding with the respective inability and ability of these two
BrCa cell types to generate de novo CSC-like cells. As we argue here, differences in
chromatin configuration appear to be responsible for the profound differences in cell
plasticity. This yields, in turn, the interesting notion that the aggressiveness of certain breast
carcinomas may not be determined by their steady-state concentrations of CD44hi stem-like
cells; instead, their content of non-CSC cells with a proclivity to readily spawn CD44hi
stem-like derivatives may strongly influence the overall malignant behavior of these tumors.
Stated differently, the bivalency of the ZEB1 promoter in carcinoma cells may represent a
useful prognostic parameter of tumor aggressiveness, a notion that will require extensive
clinical testing and validation. Since such bivalent chromatin is already present in certain
immortalized, non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells, this might suggest that the
establishment of such bivalency occurs during the normal ontogeny of this lineage
differentiation.
The nature of ZEB1-associated poised chromatin in basal CD44lo cells suggests that those
cells may readily and efficiently re-enter a stem-like state given the appropriate stimulus.
Indeed, we demonstrated that TGFbeta, a well-known EMT-inducing stimulus (Gregory et
al., 2011), can efficiently promote non-CSC-to-CSC conversion. The same TGFbeta
stimulus failed to induce luminal CD44lo cells to convert to the CSC state (Figure 7E). Here,
bivalency associated with the ZEB1 promoter permits basal-type non-CSCs to respond to the
same stimulus in a qualitatively different manner than luminal type non-CSCs. In that
regard, it is plausible that basal non-CSCs located in an inflammatory microenvironment
that is rich in EMT-inducing heterotypic signals may respond to local stimuli by switching
to a CD44hi CSC state; the resulting cells may then significantly enhance the aggressiveness
of the tumors in which they reside.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

At present, it seems plausible that disseminating CSCs are the principal agents of metastasis,
as they are endowed with multiple traits that are essential for completion of most of the steps
of the invasion-metastasis cascade (Thiery et al., 2009). However, in light of the plasticity
that we can now ascribe to basal CD44lo non-CSCs, it is conceivable that they too may leave
a primary tumor and, following arrival at secondary tissue sites, create pools of newly
formed CSCs that are critical to subsequent spawning of metastatic deposits. If validated,
this would suggest that certain tumors are clinically aggressive because they can dispatch
non-CSCs (which are usually far more numerous than CSCs) to distant sites as founders of
new metastatic colonies following non-CSC-to-CSC conversions. In the same manner,
plastic basal-CD44lo cells may also contribute to disease recurrence. These and other
considerations suggest that therapies directed at preventing non-CSC-to-CSC conversions

should be considered as essential components of adjuvant therapies for breast cancer
patients and, quite possibly, patients suffering other types of neoplastic disease.

(A) FACS analysis for CD44 expression in purified HME-flopc-CD44hi cells. Cells express
a doxycycline (dox) inducible control shRNA (control) or shRNA targeting ZEB1 (sh1 and
sh2). -/- no dox, +/- dox on for 8 days then removed for the remaining 8 days, +/+ dox on for
the duration of the experiment. The percentage of spontaneously arising CD44lo cells was
determined by FACS over a 16 day time period.
(B) Purified HME-flopc-CD44hi cells expressing control or shRNA targeting ZEB1 (sh1,
sh2 and sh3) were assessed for mammosphere-forming ability with or without doxinduction. Cells were treated with a MIR200C inhibitor (I) or mimetic (M). p<0.001, twoway ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test, *- different to miR-control
and miR-200c-M, **- different to miR-control and miR-200c-I
(C) Transformed HME-flopc-CD44hi cells expressing control, sh1 or sh2 were assessed for
mammosphere formation with or without dox-induction (p<0.0001, one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test, *-different to sh(-)).
(D) Transformed HME-flopc-CD44hi cells (control, sh1 and sh2) were purified by FACS
and implanted into the fat pad of NOD/SCID mice (n = 8/group). Tumor weight and
incidence are shown.

Figure 7. ZEB1 in clinical cases of breast cancer

(A) MIR200C accounts for 93% (sd=5%) of mature miRNA in the MIR200BC family, which
also includes MIR200B (6%) and MIR429 (1%), so subsequent analysis uses MIR200C to
represent the MIR200BC family.
(B) Levels of ZEB1 and MIR200C are inversely correlated in basal (p=9.4e-4; r2=0.13),
luminal A (p=2.8e-4; r2=0.07) and luminal B (p=6.8e-4; r2=0.12) subtypes (but not Her2).
ZEB1 is shown as median-centered values and MIR200C by log2-transformed reads per
million mapped reads (RPM).

(E) Schematic depicting: 1) an alternative CSC model for basal-type BrCa that includes
bidirectional conversions between CSCs and non-CSCs, and 2) a model of non-CSC-to-CSC
conversion that includes a microenvironmental stimulus acting on non-CSCs harboring
bivalent chromatin marks at the ZEB1 promoter enabling a rapid activation of ZEB1 and
switch to a CSC state.
