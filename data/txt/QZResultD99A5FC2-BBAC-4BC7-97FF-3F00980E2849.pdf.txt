ABSTRACT:
BCR-ABL1-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors prolong the life of patients with
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but cannot completely eradicate CML progenitors.
The BH3 mimetic, ABT-263, targets prosurvival BCL2 family members, and has
activity against CML progenitors. However, the inhibitory effect of ABT-263 on BCLXL, which mediates platelet survival, produces dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. A
second-generation BH3 mimetic, ABT-199, has been developed to specifically bind
BCL2 but not BCL-XL. We determined the activity of ABT-199 against CML cell lines,
as well as primary CML and normal cord blood (NCB) progenitors. We find that BCL2
expression levels predict sensitivity to ABT-199 in CML and NCB progenitors, and that
high NCB BCL2 levels may explain the reported hematologic toxicities in ABT-199treated patients. Also, while single agent ABT-199 has modest activity against CML
progenitors, when combined with imatinib, ABT-199 significantly enhances imatinib
activity against CML progenitors at concentrations predicted to avoid hematologic
toxicities.

INTRODUCTION

a dose-limiting toxicity is thrombocytopenia [12]. This
is due to the inhibitory effect of ABT-263 on BCL-XL,
which is pivotal for platelet survival [13, 14]. Recently,
a new BH3 mimetic, ABT-199, has been developed to
selectively bind BCL2 but not BCL-XL, and thus does not
harm platelets [15]. We therefore evaluated the activity of
ABT-199 against CML progenitors.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that specifically
target BCR-ABL11 have significantly prolonged the
life of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
[1]. However, TKIs do not completely eliminate CML
progenitors, and this may potentially result in disease
relapse [2, 3]. Therefore, there is an ongoing search
for therapeutic strategies that can completely eradicate
CML progenitors. Recent studies have highlighted an
important role for the pro-survival BCL2 protein in
myeloid leukemia stem cell survival and maintenance
[4, 5]. Consistent with these reports, we and others have
previously shown that the BH3 mimetics, ABT-737
and ABT-263 which target BCL2 family members, can
significantly enhance TKI-induced cell death in primary
CML cells [6-9]. ABT-737 and ABT-263 have broad
specificity against anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members
[10, 11]. However, in clinical trials that employ ABT-263,

RESULTS
We first assessed the ability of ABT-199 to induce
apoptosis in three CML cell lines, K562, KCL22, and
KYO1, and correlated ABT-199 sensitivity to the protein
expression level of pro-survival BCL2 family members.
Here, we focused on BCL2 family members that promote
CML cell survival in a BCR-ABL1-dependent fashion,
notably BCL2, BCL-XL and MCL1 [16-18]. First, we
found that BCL2 expression levels was at least 5-fold

higher in KCL22 cells compared to K562 and KYO1, and
that both K562 and KYO1 expressed higher amounts of
BCL-XL than KCL22, while for MCL1, both KCL22 and
KYO1 expressed more than K562 (Figure 1A). In K562
and KYO1 cells, we found imatinib alone but not ABT199 alone, resulted in decreased expression of all three
pro-survival proteins, and that this was associated with the
induction of apoptosis (Figures 1B-E). In KCL22 cells,
imatinib exposure also resulted in decreased expression
of all three BCL2 family members, but did not induce
cell death, a finding that is consistent with the reported
inability of these cells to activate cell death (Figure 1C, E)

[7, 19]. However, and in contrast to K562 and KYO1 cells,
KCL22 cells exhibited single agent-sensitivity to ABT199 alone, which induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent
manner (Figures 1C, lanes 3-4, and 1E). Furthermore,
when combined with imatinib, ABT-199 significantly
enhanced imatinib-induced apoptosis in KCL22 (Figure
1C, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lane 6) but not in K562
or KYO1 cells (Figures 1B & 1D, compare lanes 2 and
4 with lane 6). Together, our data demonstrate that while
CML cell lines exhibit differential sensitivity to single
agent ABT-199, combination with imatinib can enhance
the ability of ABT-199 to induce apoptosis in cell lines that
express high levels of BCL2.

Since CML progenitors have recently been described
to be particularly dependent on BCL2 for survival and
maintenance [4, 5], we evaluated the effectiveness of ABT199 in reducing the viability of primary CD34+ progenitors
from patients in both early [chronic phase (CP)], and
advanced stage [accelerated (AP)/blast phase (BP)] CML.
At the same time, we also assessed the cytotoxic effect
of ABT-199 on normal cord blood (NCB) progenitors.
We evaluated the IC50 and IC90 of ABT-199 by colony
formation assay (CFA), and used a broad concentration

range of ABT-199 (0-2uM). The concentration of
imatinib used was 2uM, which is in line with the plasma
concentrations achievable in patients with CML [20].
For CP CML progenitors, imatinib potently reduced
their average viability by 73% (Figure 2A). Compared
to imatinib, ABT-199 had a modest effect on CP CML
progenitors with an average IC50 of 500nM (Figure 2A).
The IC90 was not achieved at the maximum concentration
tested (2uM). However, when ABT-199 was combined
with imatinib, the IC90 was achieved at 5nM ABT-199,

Figure 2: Colony formation assays were used to evaluate the effectiveness of ABT-199, as a single agent (-IM) or in
combination with 2 uM imatinib (+IM), against both CML and normal cord blood (NCB) progenitors. Results of the

colony formation assays for (A) CP CML progenitors (n=4), (B) combined AP and BP CML progenitors (n=4), and (C) normal cord blood
(NCB) progenitors (n=3). For NCB, both total and CFU-GM populations are shown. For (A) and (B), colony formation for each sample was
calculated as a percentage of the total number of colony counted from the DMSO control. For (C), colony formation for each sample was
calculated as a percentage of the number of colonies counted from the DMSO control of total population. Results are given as the mean +/s.e.m. The P values were based on Student’s t test. For (C), the P value for each of the indicated total or CFU-GM population was calculated
by comparing to its corresponding DMSO control sample: *P= 0.00644, **P= 0.012, +P= 7.3 X 10-5 and ++P= 5 X 10-5. Additionally, the
following P value in (C) for each of the indicated total or CFU-GM population was calculated by comparison to the corresponding imatinib
only treatment sample: ^P= 0.00146, ^^P= 7 X 10-5, #P= 6.1 X 10-5, ##P= 1.9 X 10-4.

representing a 2-log improvement in efficacy compared to
ABT-199 alone (Figure 2A). As for advanced stage CML
progenitors, imatinib reduced their average viability by
43% (Figure 2B). Similar to CP progenitors, ABT-199 also
had a modest effect on advanced stage CML progenitors
with an average IC50 of 500nM (Figure 2B). IC90 was not
achieved at the maximum concentration tested (2uM).
However, when ABT-199 was combined with imatinib, the
viability of advanced stage CML progenitors was again
significantly reduced with an average IC90 of 200nM ABT199 (Figure 2B).
For NCB progenitors, imatinib had minimal effects
on viability (Figure 2C). ABT-199, with or without
imatinib, significantly reduced the viability of the total
population of NCB progenitors, with average IC50 and
IC90 values of 20nM and 200nM respectively (Figure
2C). It has been reported that for a given drug, the IC90
for the CFU-GM (colony forming unit-granulocyte and
macrophage) population of NCB progenitors is more

predictive of the maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) than
the IC50 value [21]. We, therefore, assessed the effect
of ABT-199, as a single agent or in combination with
imatinib, on the viability of the CFU-GM population
among NCB progenitors. We found that the average
IC50and IC90 values for ABT-199 were 20nM and 200nM
respectively (Figure 2C). Thus, our results suggest that the
MTD of ABT-199 for normal progenitors is 200nM.
Given that NCB progenitors were more sensitive
to ABT-199 than CML progenitors, we determined if
BCL2 levels were higher in the former, since high BCL2
expression levels predict ABT-199-sensitivity [15]. First,
in CML cell lines, we confirmed the positive correlation
between ABT-199-sensitivity and BCL2 expression at
both the protein (Figure 1) and mRNA (Figure 3A) levels.
Next, we observed a three- to five-fold greater expression
of BCL2 mRNA in NCB progenitors compared to early
and advanced stage CML progenitors (Figure 3B), a
finding that may underlie the relative senstivity of NCB
progenitors to ABT-199.

DISCUSSION
We find that in CML and NCB progenitors,
BCL2 expression levels predict sensitivity to the BCL2
antagonist, ABT-199, and mirror the findings in other
human malignancies. Also, while ABT-199 alone had a
modest effect on CML progenitors, combination therapy
with imatinib enhanced ABT-199’s inhibitory effects
on both early and advanced stage CML progenitors by
at least 13- and 5-fold respectively at the NCB IC90 of
200nM (Figure 2). Importantly, while our findings in
NCB progenitors explain the dose-limiting hematologic
toxicities observed in ABT-199-treated patients [22, 23],
our results also predict that the combination of ABT199 and imatinib may allow ABT-199 to be used at a
concentration which would not harm normal progenitors.
