ABSTRACT
Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) in humans is positively influenced by oxidative stress
status in kidneys. We recently reported that adaptive response to low level of chronic
oxidative stress induces malignant transformation of immortalized human renal
tubular epithelial cells. Epigenetic alterations in human RCC are well documented,
but its role in oxidative stress-induced malignant transformation of kidney cells is
not known. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential role of
epigenetic changes in chronic oxidative stress-induced malignant transformation of
HK-2, human renal tubular epithelial cells. The results revealed aberrant expression
of epigenetic regulatory genes involved in DNA methylation (DNMT1, DNMT3a and
MBD4) and histone modifications (HDAC1, HMT1 and HAT1) in HK-2 cells malignantly
transformed by chronic oxidative stress. Additionally, both in vitro soft agar assay
and in vivo nude mice study showing decreased tumorigenic potential of malignantly
transformed HK-2 cells following treatment with DNA de-methylating agent 5-aza 2’
dC further confirmed the crucial role of DNA hypermethyaltion in oxidative stressinduced malignant transformation. Changes observed in global histone H3 acetylation
(H3K9, H3K18, H3K27 and H3K14) and decrease in phospho-H2AX (Ser139) also
suggest potential role of histone modifications in increased survival and malignant
transformation of HK-2 cells by oxidative stress. In summary, the results of this study
suggest that epigenetic reprogramming induced by low levels of oxidative stress act
as driver for malignant transformation of kidney epithelial cells. Findings of this study
are highly relevant in potential clinical application of epigenetic-based therapeutics
for treatments of kidney cancers.

recently reported that adaptive response to low level of
chronic oxidative stress induces malignant transformation
of immortalized human renal tubular epithelial cells
potentially through acquisition of epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and stem cell characteristics [7].
Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the
role of oxidative stress in carcinogenesis. ROS regulates
activity of cell signaling proteins involved in cell growth,
proliferation as well as differentiation. For example, ROS
activates proteins involved in cell proliferation such as
MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/Erk1/2 (extra
cellular regulated kinase 1/2) [8, 9]; cell survival/antiapoptotic pathways such as PI3K/Akt signaling [10] and
kinases such as PDK-1 (3- phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase-1) [9]; and transcription factors involved in

INTRODUCTION
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) originates from renal
tubular epithelial cells and is the most common cancer
of the genitourinary system, next to prostate and bladder
cancer [1]. Although multiple risk factors are associated
with RCC development, the most common feature among
these risk factors is their ability to increase reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation and hence to induce
oxidative stress. For example, well-established risk factors
of RCC, such as smoking, obesity, hypertension, and
chronic kidney diseases are known to increase oxidative
stress burden in kidneys [2, 3]. Elevated but low levels
of ROS act as key cell signaling molecules and can
induce cell proliferation and transformation [4–6]. We

cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation such as NFkβ [11]. Additionally, elevated levels of ROS causing
oxidative stress has also been implicated in carcinogenesis
through transcriptional regulation of genes. For example,
upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression
from G1 to S phase such as different Cyclins (Cyclin
D3, Cyclin B2 and, Cyclin E1) [6], up-regulation of antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 [12], increased expression of genes
involved in cell motility and migration such as MMPs
[13] and Snail, a key transcription factor regulating EMT
and E-cadherin [14] by oxidative stress are known. ROS
induced 8-hydroxy-2’ -deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) DNA
adduct may also lead to mutations and aberrant expression
of genes. For example, oxidative DNA damage induced
mutations leading to activation of oncogenes such as Ras
or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 are
also reported. However, the precise mechanism through
which the ROS controls the transcriptional regulation of
genes is not clear.
Recent studies suggest that epigenetic changes
of DNA methylation and histone modifications play an
important role in regulation of gene expression at the
transcript level. For example epigenetic regulation of
genes involved in cell cycle regulation [15], cell survival
[16], apoptosis [17, 18], DNA repair [19, 20], EMT [21]
and stem cell characteristics [22] are reported in different
cell models. In addition, epigenetic changes may also
contribute to increased DNA mutations. For example,
DNA hypermethylation-mediated silencing of MGMT
(O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl transferase) gene, which
encodes for protein involved in DNA repair, increases
mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes to
promote carcinogenesis [20, 23]. Therefore, aberrant
expression of genes through epigenetic mechanism may
eventually lead to altered cellular signaling, impaired
DNA damage repair, increased mutations, genomic
instability and consequently predispose cells to malignant
transformation.
Accumulating evidence also suggests potential role
of epigenetic changes in the development and progression
of RCC [24–27]. Relatively lower frequency of mutations
in RCC as compared to other cancers and consistent
reports of DNA hypermethylation mediated silencing of
several tumor suppressor genes, further suggest greater
role of epigenetic changes rather than genetic changes in
renal carcinogenesis [24]. For example, increased DNA
methylation was reported in histologically non-cancerous
renal parenchyma collected from renal cancer patients,
when compared to corresponding normal renal tissue
collected from patients without any primary RCC [28].
Hypermethylation mediated silencing of tumor suppressor
genes such as p16, E-cadherin [29, 30], VHL [31, 32] and
RASSF1A [33] [34] have been reported in both renal cell
carcinoma cell lines as well as in RCC patients. Similarly,
multiple aberrant post-translational modifications in
histones, such as, H3K18Ac and H3K4 methylation have
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

also been implicated in renal cancer development and
progression [35, 36].
These reports clearly suggest that in addition to
genetic changes such as mutations, epigenetic changes
of DNA methylation and histone modifications also play
an important role in renal cancer development. However,
the role of epigenetic changes in chronic oxidative stressinduced renal carcinogenesis is not known. Epigenetic
modifications are potentially reversible, and hence
understanding of epigenetic regulation during malignant
transformation of renal epithelial cells will be of great
value to develop new strategies to prevent as well as to
treat RCC at early stages. Therefore, the objective of this
study was to evaluate the epigenetic changes that occur
during oxidative stress-induced malignant transformation
of renal tubular epithelial cells.

RESULTS
In this study, HK-2 human kidney epithelial cells
malignantly transformed by chronic exposure to oxidative
stress were used to evaluate the role of epigenetic changes
in oxidative stress-induced carcinogenesis. HK-2 cells are
immortalized but non-tumorigenic normal human kidney
tubular epithelial cells. We have recently reported that
chronic exposure (6 months) to low level of oxidative
stress results in malignant transformation of HK-2 cells
as confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity
assays, whereas the chronic exposure to relatively high
level of oxidative stress results in significant adaptation to
oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity [Mahalingaiah et al.,
2015]. We named the oxidative stress-induced malignantly
transformed HK-2 cells as OT-HK-2 cells, and HK-2 cells
adapted to high level of oxidative stress as OA-HK-2 cells.
Using these two cell models, the role of epigenetic changes
in oxidative stress-induced carcinogenesis was evaluated
by measuring the expression of epigenetic regulatory
genes at the transcript and protein levels. The oxidative
stress-induced epigenetic changes in histone acetylation
and methylation were also measured by Western blot
analysis. To determine the role of DNA hypermethylation
in oxidative stress-induced malignant transformation, the
OT-HK-2 cells were treated with DNA demethylating
agent 5-aza 2’ dC and its effects on cell growth, anchorage
independent growth and in vivo tumorigenic potential of
these cells were evaluated. Results of these analyses are
presented in the following sections.

Transcript level changes in expression of genes
involved in DNA methylation
Changes in expression of genes involved in
maintenance of DNA methylation (DNMT1), de novo
DNA methylation (DNMT3a), and methyl DNA binding
protein (MBD4) were evaluated in HK-2 cells exposed to
chronic oxidative stress by quantitative real time PCR.

Changes in expression of epigenetic regulatory
proteins and histone modifications

Statistically significant increase in DNMT1, DNMT3a
and MBD4 expression was observed in both OT-HK-2
and OA-HK-2 cells. In OT-HK-2 cells, increase by 2.8
folds, 4.9 folds and 3.5 folds were observed in DNMT1,
DNMT3a and MBD4 respectively (Figure 1). Similarly,
in OA-HK-2 cells, an increase by 2.4 folds, 3.3 folds
and 2.2 folds in the expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a
and MBD4 gene transcripts respectively were observed
(Figure 1).

Western blot analysis was performed to further
confirm the transcript level epigenetic regulatory gene
expression changes and to evaluate histone modifications
in HK-2 cells adapted to chronic oxidative stress. Results
of the Western blot revealed a significant increase in
DNMT1 expression in malignantly transformed HK-2
cells (OT-HK-2 cells) as well as in HK-2 cells adapted
to cytotoxic effect of high level of oxidative stress (OAHK-2 cells) as compared to control cells. This increase
in DNMT1 expression was greater in OT-HK-2 cells
when compared to OA-HK-2 cells (Figure 2). Similarly,
significant upregulation of HDAC1 was evident in OTHK-2 and OA-HK-2 cells (Figure 1). Increased HDAC1
expression was also associated with significant decrease
in histone H3 acetylation (H3K14 and H3K9) in OT-HK-2
cells (Figure 3). In OA-HK-2 cells, significant decrease
in H3K9 acetylation was observed, whereas there was no
significant change in acetylation level of H3K14. There
was no significant change in acetylation level of H3K18
in both OT-HK-2 and OA-HK-2 cells. But significant
increase in level of H3K27 acetylation was observed
in OA-HK-2 cells. Significant increase in histone H3
methylation (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) was observed in
both OT-HK-2 and OA-HK-2 cells (Figure 2). In addition,

Changes in expression of histone modifying
genes transcripts
Effect of chronic oxidative stress on histone
modification was evaluated by analyzing changes in
expression of representative genes involved in transfer
of methyl groups to histones (HMT1), transfer of acetyl
groups to histones (HAT1) and removal of acetyl groups
from histone tail (HDAC1). Significant increase in HDAC1
expression and significant decrease in HAT1 expression
was observed in both OT-HK-2 and OA-HK-2 cells.
HDAC1 expression was increased by 3.7 folds in OTHK-2 cells and by 1.8 folds in OA-HK-2 cells. Similarly,
expression of HAT1 was decreased by 2.5 and 2.3 folds
in OT-HK-2 and OA-HK-2 cells, respectively (Figure 1).
Significant increase in expression of HMT1 by 2.5 fold
was observed only in OT-HK-2 cells.

stress. Total RNA isolated from HK-2, OT-HK-2 and OA-HK-2 cells was used to perform one-step real-time quantitative reverse

transcription PCR as described in materials and methods. Cycle threshold value (Ct value) of each gene was normalized to the Ct value of
housekeeping gene GAPDH from the same sample. The gene expression in fold change was calculated and histogram was plotted using
the means of triplicate values. The error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean (±SD). An asterisk (*) indicates statistically

significant down-regulation of phospho-H2AX level was
evident in both OT-HK-2 and OA-HK-2 cells (Figure 2).

with 55.4% decrease in cell growth was observed in HK-2
cells treated with 5μM 5-aza 2’ dC for 48 hours. Based on
these results, the highest dose of 5-aza 2’ dC (2μM) with
no significant effect on cell viability of normal HK-2 cells
was selected to induce DNA demethylation in OT-HK-2
and OA-HK-2 cells.
Using the 2μM non-toxic dose of 5-aza 2’ dC,
cells were further treated and its effect on growth and
tumorigenic potential of OT-HK-2 and OA-HK-2 cells
were determined. Result of MTT assay confirmed
significant increase in growth of malignantly transformed
HK-2 cells (OT-HK-2), compared to passage matched
control. About 69.4% increase in cell growth was observed
in OT-HK-2 cells (Figure 4B). Following 5-aza 2’ dC

To optimize the dose of 5-aza 2’ dC that can induce
demethylation without any cytotoxic effect, HK-2 cells
were treated with a range of 5-aza 2’ dC from 0.5μM to
5μM and cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Results
of MTT assay showed no significant effect of 5-aza 2’ dC
treatments up to 2μM for 48 hours on cell growth/viability
of normal HK-2 cells (Figure 4A). Significant cytotoxicity

treatment, 27.2% decrease in cell growth was observed
in OT-HK-2 cells, when compared to same group of cells
without 5-aza 2’ dC treatment. In HK-2 cells adapted to
high level of oxidative stress (OA-HK-2 cells), 16.6%
decreases in cell growth was observed with 5-aza 2’ dC
treatment, but this change was not statistically significant.
Results of MTT assay, confirmed significant decrease in
growth of malignantly transformed HK-2 cells (OT-HK-2
cells) with 5-aza 2’ dC treatment.

HK-2 cells (OT-HK-2 cells), soft agar assay was
performed. Anchorage-independent growth and colony
formation on soft agar was observed in OT-HK-2
(Figure 5), whereas 5-aza 2’ dC treatment significantly
decreased both size and number of soft agar colonies
formed by OT-HK-2 cells. Hence the results of the soft
agar assay confirmed that 5-aza 2’ dC treatment decreased
in vitro tumorigenic potential of malignantly transformed
HK-2 cells.

treated OT-HK-2 cells (Figure 6). Decrease in tumor
growth with hypo-cellularity as a result of 5-aza 2’ dC
treatment was also confirmed by histological examination
of tumor samples (Figure 7). Tumor formation was
observed in all the mice inoculated with well-established
renal cell carcinoma cells (Caki-1 cell line), which are
used as a positive control cells for xenograft study. Hence
results of xenograft study further confirmed 5-aza 2’ dC

involving clonal selection of cells harboring either
inherited or acquired genetic and epigenetic changes
contributing to uncontrolled growth advantage [37].
Genetic changes such as alterations in cell signaling
pathways and oxidative DNA damage are commonly
associated with oxidative stress-induced malignancy [38].
Even though multiple reports exist to support the oxidative
stress-induced epigenetic changes, there is no direct
evidence to implicate oxidative stress-induced epigenetic
changes in malignant transformation of human kidney
epithelial cells. Therefore, the objective of this study was
to evaluate the significance of chronic oxidative stressinduced epigenetic changes in malignant transformation
of HK-2 cells. Results of our study showing significant
alterations in epigenetic regulatory proteins as well as
decrease in both in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity of
malignantly transformed cells following treatment with
DNA de-methylating agent (5-aza 2’ dC) suggested that
epigenetic reprogramming play an important role in
oxidative stress-induced malignant transformation of
kidney epithelial cells. To our knowledge, this is the first

DISCUSSION
Oxidative stress has been associated with the
etiology of multiple types of cancer including renal cell
carcinoma. We recently reported that chronic exposure
to oxidative stress leads to malignant transformation of
HK-2 cells, an immortalized cell line derived from human
normal kidney tubular epithelium. Transformation of
normal cells into malignant cells is a multistage process

report that provides direct evidence for oxidative stressinduced epigenetic alterations as driver for malignant
transformation of normal kidney epithelial cells.
Among different types of epigenetic modifications,
DNA methylation has been considered as an important
regulatory mechanism in carcinogenesis. Alterations
in DNA methylation pattern and expression of DNA
methylation regulatory proteins have been widely
implicated in renal carcinogenesis [39, 40]. Except for
VHL gene, the occurrences of mutations are relatively
infrequent in RCC. On the other hand numerous reports
of DNA hypermethylation-mediated silencing of several
tumor suppressor genes further suggest the important
role of epigenetic changes in renal carcinogenesis [24].
A significant increase in expression of DNMTs (DNMT1
and DNMT3a) as observed in OT-HK-2 and OA-HK-2
cells in this study suggests a potential role of DNA
hypermethylation in chronic oxidative stress-induced
malignant transformation of HK-2 cells. Moreover,

a decrease in growth and tumorigenic potential of
malignantly transformed HK-2 cells following 5-aza 2’
dC treatment in our study further support a role of DNA
hypermethylation in chronic oxidative stress-induced renal
carcinogenesis. Similar results of DNA hypermethylation
during oxidative stress-induced anchorage independent
growth and malignant transformation of melanocytes have
been reported [41]. ROS-induced DNA hypermethylation
have also been suggested to be associated with colorectal
cancer [42], hepatic cancer [43] and pancreatic cancer [44].
Oxidative stress may influence DNA methylation through
different mechanisms including upregulation of DNA
methyl transferase enzymes (DNMTs), altered structure
and function of epigenetic regulatory proteins such as
DNMTs and/or by recruitment of epigenetic regulatory
proteins, such as polycomb proteins, at the sites of
oxidative stress-induced DNA modifications/damage [45,
46]. Increased expression of DNMTs and their correlation
to increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis in patients

microscopically for histopathological changes. In 5-aza 2’ dc treated group, decreased tumor volume/growth was histologically characterized

have been reported in multiple cancers including breast,
colon, prostate, lung, and kidney cancers [47]. Therefore,
finding of this study together with previous reports suggest
that chronic oxidative stress, through increased expression
of DNMTs, leads to DNA hypermethylation-mediated
inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and consequently
the carcinogenesis.
Participation in repressive complex of proteins is
yet another known mechanisms through which DNMTs
can function in transcriptional silencing of genes. For
example, increased recruitment of DNMT1 to the
sites of oxidative damaged chromatin in hydrogen
peroxide exposed cells resulting in formation of a large
transcriptionally repressive complex containing DNMT1,
DNMT3b and polycomb repressive complex 4 (PRC4)
components including SIRT have been proposed as yet
another mechanism for oxidative stress-mediated DNA
hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of genes
[48]. Whether the increased expression of DNMT1 in
cells chronically exposed to oxidative stress as observed
in the present study contributed to increased cell survival
through suppressing the expression of apoptotic genes
through similar mechanism involving transcriptionally
repressive complex is a question that needs to be addressed
in future study.
In addition to increase in DNMTs expression, the
data of this study also revealed a significant increase in
MBD4 expression in renal epithelial cells malignantly
transformed during adaptation to chronic oxidative stress.
Methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBDs) proteins play an
important role in DNA methylation-mediated silencing
of genes and in integrating both DNA methylation and
histone modifications. MBD4 is an essential protein
which promotes cell survival during oxidative stress [49].
Synergistic cooperation of MBD4 in DNMT1 mediated
hypermethylation and transcriptional repression of genes
to protect cells against oxidative stress-induced cell death
has been reported in human primary and transformed cells
[49]. Increased level of both MBD4 and DNMT1 have
been reported in mammalian cells exposed to oxidative
stress [49] and it has been concluded that both these
proteins are recruited to sites of oxidative DNA damage
and they synergistically interact to induce transcriptional
repression of genes such as CDKN1A/p21 (DNA damage
response gene) and MSH4. Multiple reports confirm that,
deficiency of MBD4 increases sensitivity of human cells
to DNA damage by H2O2 induced oxidative stress [49].
Therefore, in addition to increased expression of DNMT1,
the increased level of MBD4 as observed in this study
can also potentially impact the increased cell survival
through chromatin remodeling at the site of oxidative
DNA damage resulting in loss of DNA damage-dependent
apoptotic response.
In addition to DNA methylation, post-translational
modifications in histone tails also play an important
role as an additional layer of epigenetic regulation [50].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In the present study, a significant increase in expression
of HDAC1, an enzyme involved in post-translational
modification of histones was also observed in malignantly
transformed OT-HK-2 cells. Oxidative stress-induced
histone modifications through altered structure and
function of HMTs and HDACs as well as recruitment
of histone modulating protein complexes to the sites of
H2O2-induced DNA damage involving promoter regions
of tumor suppressor genes may contribute to malignant
transformation of cells [48]. HDACs play a role in normal
development of kidney as well as in pathogenesis of
kidney diseases including cancer through influencing
expression of several genes involved in carcinogenesis
[51]. It has been reported that HDAC1 is critical for
mitosis in cancer cells and its absence induces activation
of caspases leading to apoptosis mediated cell death
[52]. HDAC mediated regulation of cell proliferation
and apoptosis may also result from deacetylation of nonhistone proteins such as transcription factors and proteins
involved in regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis
[51, 53]. HDAC1 mediated cell proliferation regulation
is mainly mediated by suppression of key target gene
p21, a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor and an important
growth suppressive gene [54–57]. Treatment of renal cell
carcinoma cell lines with HDAC inhibitor, VPA results in
increased expression of p21with decreased proliferation
of cells [58]. HDAC mediated transcriptional regulation is
also mediated by association of HDAC proteins with multi
protein corepressor complex or through direct interaction
of HDAC proteins with transcription factor of different
genes such as p53, Rb, NF-kβ [59]. Role of HDAC1 in
regulation of oxidative stress mediated apoptosis has been
mainly implicated for its association with p53 protein
[60, 61]. Recent study also demonstrated that HDAC1induced decreased expression of thioredoxin binding
protein-2 will result in decreased sensitivity of cancer cells
to oxidative stress induced cytotoxicity (Takuya Kato et al
2009). Another study revealed that increased oxidative
stress in kidney cells increases HDAC level and decrease
acetylation of proteins, and therefore this study further
suggest the impact of oxidative stress on the function of
histone deacetylase [62]. Therefore, these previous reports
and the finding of increased expression of HDAC1 in H2O2
exposed kidney epithelial cells in this study, together
suggest that adaptive response of cells to oxidative stressinduced cytotoxicity leading to increased cell survival
is potentially mediated by HDAC1-mediated histone
modifications and chromatin remodeling at the target
genes for cell survival. Future studies for identification
of these target genes would further help in mechanistic
understanding of the epigenetic basis for oxidative stressinduced carcinogenesis.
Cross talk between DNA methylation and histone
modifications in cancer cells is also supported by
enrichment of specific histone marks in the regions of
DNA hypermethylation [21]. DNA methylation-induced
11136

gene silencing is commonly associated with decreased
acetylation of histone H3 and H4 proteins [63]. Synergistic
epigenetic reactivation of gene expression following
combination of DNA de-methylating agent (5-aza 2’ dC)
and histone modifying drugs (Trichostatin), also support
these reports [64]. Interaction between MBD proteins
and HDAC proteins also play a role in regulating cross
talk between DNA methylation and histone acetylation
[65]. Reports showing influence of HDAC inhibitors
on DNA methylation [66] and DNMT inhibitors on
histone modifications [67], further confirms cross talk
between DNA methylation and histone post-translational
modifications. Histone H3 and H4 commonly undergo
different type of post-translational modifications that
determine their association with either transcriptionally
active or repressive chromatin. Acetylation of histone H3
is considered as a well characterized and key epigenetic
modification involved in regulating expression of genes
involved in carcinogenesis [68, 69]. Data from this study
also revealed that the increase in HDAC1 expression
during oxidative stress-induced transformation of HK-2
cells is also associated with decrease in global histone
H3 acetylation involving H3K9, H3K18, H3K27 and
H3K14. Recent report also suggest that epigenetic changes
of global histone modifications, such as acetylation of
H3K9 and H3K18, are decreased with progression of
RCC and hence these histone modifications can be used
as potential markers for RCC prognosis [35]. Oxidative
stress-induced hypo acetylation of histones is reported at
both global as well as gene-specific promoter levels. H2O2induced transcriptional repression of p21 is associated
with formation of hypo-acetylated repressive chromatin
at the p21 promoter region of human breast cancer cell
lines [70]. Increased cytotoxic effect of mTOR inhibitors
in combination with HDAC inhibitors on RCC xenograft
growth are also reported in pre-clinical studies [71].
Decrease in acetylation of Histone H3K16 along with
activity of MYST (Moz-Ybf2/Sas3-Sas2-Tip60), an
enzyme involved in transfer of acetyl group to H3K16
has been correlated with pathogenesis of RCC [72].
Inverse correlation between acetylation of histone H3 and
progression/metastasis of renal cell carcinoma has been
reported [72].
Similar to histone H3 acetylation, histone H3
methylation is implicated in cancer development. Histone
methylation is mediated by group of enzymes called
histone methyl transferases (HMT), which can transfer
methyl groups to arginine or lysine to induce mono, di
or tri methylation of histone proteins. Significant increase
in HMT1 expression and histone H3K27 tri-methylation
and H3K4 methylation levels in our cell model further
indicates a potential role of histone methylation in
adaptive response to chronic oxidative stress. Changes
in methylation involving H4K9 and H3K27 are
commonly reported in cancer cells [73]. Histone H3K27

tri-methylation represent repressive chromatin with loss of
tumor suppressor gene expression may eventually lead to
malignant transformation of cells [74, 75]. Increased levels
of global histone H3K27 and H3K4 methylation have
been reported in RCC patients and also their expressions
were correlated with progression and recurrence of RCC
[36, 76]. H2O2-induced global histone modifications with
increase in histone H3 methylation (H3K27 and H3K4)
and decrease in acetylation of histone H3K9 reported
in immortalized bronchial epithelial cells [77] further
support our study findings. Oxidative stress-induced
histone H3K4 methylation has been related to increased
oxidation of Fe (II) to Fe (III) resulting in decreased
activity of histone modifying enzymes such as JmjC
domain-containing histone demethylases [77]. Therefore,
these previous reports and the finding of increased global
histone H3 modifications observed during oxidative stressinduced malignant transformation of HK-2 cells in this
study further support the role of histone modifications
in oxidative stress-induced kidney carcinogenesis either
directly or indirectly through epigenetic protein complexdependent chromatin remodeling and changes in genes
expression.
Histone H2AX, a variant of H2A protein play an
important role as a guardian of the genome, and loss of
H2AX may induce genomic instability with increased
chance of cancer development. Dynamic nucleosome
remodeling including phosphorylation of H2AX protein
by DNA damage responsive kinases play a key role in
oxidative stress-induced DNA repair mechanism [48,
78]. Phosphorylation of H2AX, specifically facilitate
stable interaction between base excision repair (BER)
proteins and sites of damaged DNA induced by oxidative
stress [79]. In the present study, a significant decrease in
phospho-H2AX (Ser139) level was observed in HK-2
cells malignantly transformed by chronic oxidative
stress (OT-HK2 cells) Recently it has been reported that
phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 139 and serine 16
positions can prevent malignant transformation of cells
[80]. Hence, the result of our study showing a decrease in
the level of phospho-H2AX (Ser139) is consistent with this
previous report and further supports the role of decreased
level of phospho-H2AX in increased cell survival
and malignant transformation. Increased formation of
phospho-H2AX observed in human lung carcinoma cells
exposed to ionizing radiation [81] and decreased levels
of phospho-H2AX with increased expression of DNMT1
by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors [82, 83] further
support our results in malignantly transformed renal
epithelial cells.
To our knowledge, this is the first report providing
direct evidence for the role of epigenetic mechanism as
driver for the chronic oxidative stress-induced malignant
transformation of renal tubular epithelial cells. Further
study on identification and functional characterization

oxidative stress- induced transformation and adaptation to
stress, HK-2 cells exposed to chronic oxidative stress were
treated with DNA de-methylating agent (2μM of 5-aza 2’
dC) for 48 hours and then used for analysis of cell growth
and tumorigenic potential. Control group HK-2 cells were
treated with vehicle (0.001% DMSO) only in the culture
medium.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals

Cell viability assay

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 30% (w/v) solution,
3-(4,5
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT), and 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza 2’
dC) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Serum
free Keratinocyte medium with growth factors, trypsin/
EDTA solution, and Trizol reagent were purchased from
Invitrogen Inc. For protein extraction, RIPA lysis buffer
(1X) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

HK-2 cells exposed to chronic oxidative stress and
passage matched control cells were seeded at a density of
2000 cells per well in 96 well flat bottom culture plates
and allowed to grow for 24 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2
in an incubator. To evaluate the role of DNA methylation,
respective groups of cells were given exposure (48 hours)
to 5-aza 2’ dC as mentioned earlier, and then cells were
incubated with 10% MTT solution for 3 hours at 37°C
with 5% CO2. Cell culture media was removed and DMSO
(150μL) was added in to each well to dissolve water
insoluble formazan crystals formed in mitochondria. The
intensity of the color formed due to DMSO dissolved
formazan in each well was measured at 570 and 630 nm
absorbance using microplate reader. Treatments were
performed in triplicates and experiment was repeated
twice.

Cell culture and treatments
HK-2 cells were purchased from ATCC and
maintained in Keratinocyte serum free medium
supplemented with human recombinant EGF, bovine
pituitary extract and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution.
HK-2 cells are immortalized human proximal tubular
epithelial cells derived from normal kidney and are
non-tumorigenic. HK-2 cell cultures were grown and
maintained at 37°C with a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. H2O2is known to increase intracellular
levels of highly reactive hydroxyl radical and has been
used in multiple studies to induce oxidative stress in both
in vitro cell cultures as well as in animal models [84–86].
Therefore, for chronic exposure of cells to oxidative stress,
actively growing HK-2 cells were treated with 25μM (a
lower non-cytotoxic) and 250μM (a higher cytotoxic)
concentrations of H2O2. These cells, after reaching a
confluency of about 80%, were sub-cultured, grown for
24 hours, and then given fresh treatment of H2O2. Using
this method, cells were grown for 6 months in H2O2
containing media. HK-2 cell cultures for chronic treatment
were maintained and treated in triplicate and also parallel
cultures were grown and maintained as a passage matched
controls. To evaluate the role of DNA hypermethylation in

Soft agar assay for colony formation
Soft agar colony formation assay was performed
to evaluate the effect of 5-aza 2’ dC on anchorageindependent growth (in vitro assay to confirm malignant
transformation) of HK-2 cells with chronic exposure to
oxidative stress. Base layer of soft agar was prepared by
pouring 1.5 mL of 0.5% agar in Keratinocyte media in
each well of 6 well plates and allowed to polymerize for
few minutes. Top layer of soft agar was prepared using
0.35% agar in Keratinocyte media and cells from each
treatment groups were mixed (5000 cells in 1.5 mL soft
agar solution) and plated over the base layer in each
well. All the soft agar plates were allowed to solidify and
then maintained at 37°C with a humidified atmosphere

containing 5% CO2. Colony formation of cells on soft
agar was monitored by microscopic observation on daily
basis. On Day 14, colonies were counted manually using
microscope and representative images were taken. The
soft agar grown colony numbers in treatment groups were
expressed as a percentage compared to vehicle control.

expression changes were analyzed by single step qRT-PCR
amplifications in MyiQ2 real time PCR detection system
(BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using one-step RTPCR kit with SYBR green and total RNA (200ng). PCR
reactions were performed with reverse transcription at
50°C for 15 min, denaturation and reverse transcriptase
inactivation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles (10
seconds each) of denaturation at 95°C and annealing and
extension at 60°C for 30 seconds. Melt curve analysis was
included to confirm the specificity of PCR products. PCR
amplification data of each gene were normalized to Ct
value of internal housekeeping gene (GAPDH) from the
same sample and the fold-changes in gene expression were
calculated by using the delta-delta Ct method [87]. List of
forward and reverse primer sequences used for RT-PCR
analysis have been given in Table 1.

Evaluation of in vivo tumorigenic potential of
transformed HK-2 cells
Effect of DNA demethylation by 5-aza 2’ dC
treatments on in vivo tumorigenic potential of HK-2
cells malignantly transformed by chronic oxidative
stress was evaluated by subcutaneous xenograft study in
athymic nude mice. A total of 25 athymic nude female
mice (5-6 week old) were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories and were allowed for acclimatization for
7 days. These mice were randomly divided into five
groups with 5 mice in each group. Group 1 and group
2 animals were injected with HK-2 cells exposed to
vehicle control and 5-aza 2’ dC, respectively. Group 3
and group 4 animals were injected with transformed
HK-2 cells (OT-HK-2 cells) exposed to vehicle control
and 5-aza 2’ dC, respectively. Group 5 animals were
injected with Caki-1 renal carcinoma cells as a positive
control. Mice in respective group were subcutaneously
(right flank region) inoculated with 107 cells suspended in
200μL solution of 1X phosphate buffered saline. All the
animals were maintained by providing standard laboratory
conditions in individually ventialted (IVC) cages with ad
libitum food and water. Animals were subjected for daily
observation for their general health condition and also for
tumor fromation.Tumor formed at the site of injection
was measured at weekly intervals for 4 weeks and tumor
volume (V) calculations were made using the standard
formula V= (Width)2 x Length/2. At the end of the study
(4 weeks), all mice were euthanized by anaesthetizing
them using CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. For
histopathological analysis, tumor samples were fixed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then processed
for paraffin embedding using standard procedures,
and 5μM sections of tumor samples were stained with
Hematoxylin and Eosin stain. Tumor sections were
evaluated microscopically for histopathological changes
and representative photomicrographs were captured
using Nikon microscope. Animal study was approved by
institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) and
all procedures were performed in accordance with the
approved protocol and institutional guidelines.

Western blot analysis
Total cellular protein lysates of HK-2 cells from
different treatment and control groups were prepared using
RIPA lysis buffer and quantified by Bradford assay. Protein
samples (30μg) were separated by gel electrophoresis
on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose
membrane and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by
5% non-fat dried milk solution (containing 0.05% Tween
20) at 4°C. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated
with primary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour.
Based on the reaction efficiency, the following dilutions
of primary antibodies were used: 1:250 of GAPDH (Santa
Cruz, Cat # SC-25778), 1:100 of DNMT1 (Santa Cruz,
Cat#10219), 1:100 of HDAC1 (Santa Cruz, Cat# sc-6298),
1:1000 of H3K9Ac (Cell signaling, Cat #9671), 1:1000 of
H3K18Ac (Cell signaling, Cat #9441), 1:1000 of H3K27Ac
(Cell signaling, Cat #8173), 1: 500 of H3K14Ac, (Cell
signaling, Cat #9677) 1:500 of H3K4me (Millipore Cat
# 04-745), 1:200 of H3K27me3 (Millipore, Cat#17-622),
and 1: 500 of phospho H2AX (Cell signaling, Cat #2577).
After giving three washes with washing buffer (1X PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20) for 10 minutes each wash,
the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary
antibody (1:1000) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed
again with washing buffer for three times (10 minutes
each) and signal intensity was captured using an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham, NJ).
The intensity of protein bands was quantified (using Image
J software) and normalized to expression of GAPDH.
