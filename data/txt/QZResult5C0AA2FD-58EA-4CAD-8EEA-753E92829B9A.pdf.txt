Abstract
One of the major problems in treating colon cancer is
chemoresistance to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. There
is therefore a need to devise new strategies to inhibit colon
cancer cell growth and survival. Here, we show that a combination of low doses of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin
together with the specific cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor rolipram, but not the cAMP phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3) inhibitor cilostamide, causes profound
growth arrest of chemoresistant KM12C colon cancer cells.
Low-dose forskolin causes KM12C cells to exit the cell cycle in
G1 by inducing p27Kip1 and primes cells for apoptosis on
addition of rolipram. The effect of the low-dose forskolin/
rolipram combination is mediated by displacement of the
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate/phosphoinositide
3-kinase signaling module from the plasma membrane and
suppression of the Akt/protein kinase-B oncogene pathway,
to which KM12C cells are addicted for growth. The cAMP
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways form a critical intersection in this response, and reexpression of the tumor
suppressor lipid phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homologue, which is commonly lost or mutated in colon cancer,
sensitizes KM12C cells to growth inhibition by challenge with
low-dose forskolin. Certain chemoresistant colon cancer cells
are therefore exquisitely sensitive to subtle elevation of cAMP
by a synergistic low-dose adenylyl cyclase activator/PDE4
inhibitor combination. Indeed, these cells are addicted to
maintenance of low cAMP concentrations in a compartment
that is regulated by PDE4. Well-tolerated doses of PDE4 inhibitors that are already in clinical development for other therapeutic indications may provide an exciting new strategy for
the treatment of colon cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5248–57]

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the third commonest cancer in the United
Kingdom, which can, at present, only be cured by complete
resection of the primary tumor and isolated metastasis. In reality,
the majority of metastatic tumors are not resectable, and

chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for a large number of
patients. Currently, chemotherapy, which is usually 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), or capecitabine, which is processed to generate 5-FU in
tumor cells, folinic acid, or newer agents such as irinotecan or
oxaliplatin, improves survival in only a proportion of cases
(reviewed in ref. 1). Although chemotherapy can also give a
modest improvement in time to tumor progression and overall
survival in more advanced disease, there remains an urgent need
for new treatments to improve survival. Here, we have used cancer
cells of various origins, including those from the Fidler model of
colorectal metastasis (2), to examine whether modulators of cAMP
may successfully intervene in chemoresistant cancers, and to
identify both mechanism and circumstances in which this might be
useful.
Cyclic AMP (cAMP) acts as a second messenger that controls a
diverse range of cellular processes (3), usually through activation of
either or both protein kinase A (PKA; ref. 4) and the cAMP-GTP
exchange factor Epac (5). cAMP signaling is regulated in both
spatial and temporal manner by cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDE;
ref. 6), which provide the sole route for degradation of cAMP in
cells (3, 7). Whereas a large and complex enzyme family provide for
cAMP phosphodiesterase activity within cells, invariably the
majority of cAMP-hydrolyzing activity is provided by members of
the phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) and phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4)
families (7, 8). However, enzymes of the PDE4 family have attracted
much recent interest because they play a key role in underpinning
compartmentalized cAMP signaling in many cell types (9) and
because PDE4-specific inhibitors seem to have therapeutic
potential as anti-inflammatory agents for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and as cognitive enhancers and antidepressants (7, 10).
In the cancer context, there are some reports suggesting that
modulating intracellular cAMP levels may have effects on the
behavior of cancer cells (11). For example, the archetypal PDE3selective inhibitor cilostazol (12) and the archetypal PDE4-selective
inhibitor rolipram (7) both suppress colon cancer cell motility (13),
whereas inhibition PDE4 by rolipram can negatively affect chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (14). Interestingly, rolipram can also induce
expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, leading to
growth inhibition and differentiation of glioma cells (15), although
a high concentration of rolipram was required for these effects. The
cAMP-elevating agent forskolin (16), when used at high doses, has
been reported to inhibit DNA replication in lymphocytes via PKAmediated effects on p21CIP1, leading to dephosphorylation of the
retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and disrupted tethering of proliferating cell nuclear antigen to DNA (17). Taken together, these
reports tantalizingly suggest that modulating intracellular cAMP,

Chemoresistant Cancer Cells and PDE4 Modulation

perhaps in a localized manner by targeting particular PDE types,
may affect the proliferation of cancer cells.
In the present study, we set out to test the hypothesis that some
chemoresistant epithelial cancer cells are ‘‘addicted’’ to oncogenic
growth-regulatory pathways that may be influenced by cAMP
modulation. This would provide a novel, and much needed, way to
inhibit such cancer cells, particularly if it could be achieved by welltolerated synergistic low doses of cAMP modulators. We found that
a combination of relatively low doses of forskolin and rolipram (but
interestingly not cilostamide) can work together to cause growth
arrest and apoptosis via sustained inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and effects on regulators of G1
progression. Reexpression of the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) lipid phosphatase, which negatively regulates PI3K
and is commonly lost or mutated in many human malignancies
(18, 19), slows the growth of KM12C cells at low density and
renders them more sensitive to growth inhibition by the low-dose
forskolin/rolipram treatment. Therefore, KM12C colon cancer cells,
which are resistant to cytotoxic agent-induced cell death, can be
effectively growth inhibited and killed by particular modulators of
cAMP degradation and synthesis; in this case, specifically by a
mechanism that ablates signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway,
to which these cells are addicted for growth and survival. In a
survey of 11 cancer cell lines (including 7 colon cancer cell lines),
we found that up to 8 of these are sensitive to the forskolin/
rolipram combination to a greater or lesser extent, implying that
this may have more general applicability as a way of inhibiting
cancer cells that are otherwise extremely difficult to kill.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and cell lines. KM12C cells were provided by Prof. I. Fidler
(Department of Cancer Biology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
TX) and KM12/2C4 cells were derived as previously reported (20), MCF7,
HT29, A431, WiDr, RKO, A375, H630, Du145, SW480, and SW620 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. MCF7 and KM12C
cells were cultured in Eagle’s MEM with Earle’s salts supplemented with
MEM vitamins, nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine (2 mmol/L), and
sodium pyruvate (1 mmol/L; all from Life Technologies) in the presence
of 10% fetal bovine serum (Autogen Bioclear). HT29, A431, WiDr, RKO,
A375, and Du145 cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
L-glutamine (2 mmol/L; Life Technologies) and 10% fetal bovine serum
(Autogen Bioclear). SW480, SW620, and H630 cells were cultured in RPMI
(Invitrogen) supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mmol/L; Life Technologies)
and 10% fetal bovine serum (Autogen Bioclear). All cells were routinely
maintained in a humidified incubator at 37jC with 5% CO2 and subcultured
before reaching confluence. Cells expressing PTEN-green fluorescent
protein (GFP; NH2-terminal tag) were generated by retroviral infection of
KM12C/2C4 cells with PTEN-GFP in pWZL vector, and single-cell clones
were selected in growth media containing 400 Ag/mL hygromycin B
(Calbiochem).
Modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assay. Cell proliferation and viability was assayed
indirectly by a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay, based on the enzymatic reduction of MTT (Sigma) to
formazan crystal by mitochondria and cellular dehydrogenase enzymes
(21). Briefly, 50 AL of cell suspension containing 1,000 cells were dispensed
into 96-well flat-bottomed microplates. Dilutions of pharmacologic agents
in growth media were done in four replicate rows per cell type and per
dilution. Plates were then incubated in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at
37jC. At the time points indicated, 50 AL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL MTT in
PBS) were added to a total volume of 100 AL and incubated in 5% CO2 at
37jC for 4 h. Formazan crystals were dissolved with 100-AL DMSO and
absorbance at 570 nm was determined with a plate reader.

Immunoblotting. Cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle), forskolin,
rolipram (all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich), or LY294002 (obtained from
Calbiochem) at the concentrations and times indicated before generation
of cell extracts. Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mmol/L Tris,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol pH 7.4)
from subconfluent cell cultures and clarified by centrifugation at 4jC. Total
protein was measured using microBCA reagent (Pierce). Proteins were
resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked before
probing with indicated specific antibodies and detection by horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibodies (antimouse and antirabbit HRP, Cell Signaling). Antibodies used in this study include antip27KIP1 (Becton Dickinson Transduction Laboratories); anti-vinculin
(Sigma-Aldrich); anti-p21CIP1, anti–cyclin A, anti–cyclin E, and anti–CDK1
(Cdc2 p34; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and anti–phospho-Akt (Ser473 and
Thr308) and total Akt (Cell Signaling Technologies). pRb was resolved by
7.5% SDS-PAGE (29.74% acrylamide/0.24% bis-acrylamide) gels before
transfer and probed with anti–total pRb antibody (Becton Dickinson
Transduction Laboratories). For immunoblotting, 50 to 100 Ag of cellular
proteins were resolved as above.
Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection. Cells were fixed in 70%
ethanol in PBS overnight. For DNA content analysis, cells were pelleted and
resuspended in PBS containing 1 Ag/mL RNase (Qiagen Ltd.) and 10 Ag/mL
propidium iodide, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, then analyzed
using a Becton Dickinson (Oxford, United Kingdom) FACScan flow
cytometer. To monitor bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, cells
were incubated with 20 Amol/L BrdUrd for the final hour of treatment,
fixed, and incubated with an anti-BrdUrd antibody (Dako) followed by
FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Apoptosis was quantified using an
Annexin V-FITC detection kit (Becton Dickinson) and staining was carried
out per manufacturers’ instructions. Briefly, KM12C cells were set up at low
density and treated for 24, 48, or 72 h with the treatments indicated. At each
time point, cells were washed with cold PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended
in binding buffer (100 mmol/L HEPES, 1.4 mol/L NaCl, 25 mmol/L CaCl2,
pH 7.4) at a concentration of 1  106/mL and 100 AL of resuspended cells
were incubated with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide.
Microscopy and immunofluorescence. Cell were plated at a density of
1.5  105 per glass coverslip for transfection and 7  104 per glass coverslip
for all other imagings. KM12C cells were transiently transfected with 1.5 Ag
of GFP fused to the plektstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt (GFP-PH;
ref. 22) construct for 4 h using Polyfect (Qiagen) and left in fresh media
overnight. Cells were treated with pharmacologic agents and then fixed
using 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. GFP was
visualized with a confocal microscope (Leica).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Phosphodiesterase assay. PDE assays were done by a modification (23)
of the two-step method by Thomson and Appleman (24). In brief, cells were
lysed in KHEM buffer [50 mmol/L KCl, 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.2),
10 mmol/L EGTA, 1.92 mmol/L MgCl2] containing protease inhibitors
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were then subjected to 14,000  g for
15 min at 4jC and the resulting supernatants were assayed for total PDE
activity using 1 Amol/L cAMP and [3H]cAMP as a substrate. To determine
the contribution of various PDE family members to the total PDE activity,
family specific inhibitors were used at a final concentration that completely
inhibited their activities. PDE3 and PDE4 activities were determined using
10 Amol/L cilostamide (PDE3; ref. 12) or 10 Amol/L rolipram (PDE4;
refs. 7, 10).

Results
cAMP modulators cause growth suppression. Treatment
of KM12C cells with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (at
50 Amol/L) completely inhibits their growth (Fig. 1A), an effect that
is mediated by cAMP as it is mimicked by challenging cells with
the cell-permeant cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8-BrcAMP; 300 Amol/L; Fig. 1A). However, treatment of KM12C cells

Figure 1. Specific cAMP elevation inhibits KM12C proliferation. Proliferation of
KM12C cells was monitored over a 5-d period using a MTT dye–based assay,
during which the cells were treated with modulators of cAMP. A, cells were
treated with vehicle only (control ; DMSO), 50 Amol/L forskolin (FSK ; a adenylyl
cyclase activator), 300 Amol/L 8-Br-cAMP (a nonhydrolyzable cAMP analogue),
100 Amol/L 8-pMeOPT-2¶-O-Me-cAMP (a Epac-specific activator), 100 Amol/L
IBMX (a nonspecific PDE inhibitor), 10 Amol/L cilostamide (a PDE3-specific
inhibitor), and 10 Amol/L rolipram (a PDE4-specific inhibitor). B, a concentration
range of forskolin (0.1–50 Amol/L) was carried out to establish which
concentration (1 Amol/L) gave an f50% inhibition of proliferation. C, stimulation
of KM12C cells with low-dose forskolin (1 Amol/L) in combination with a PDE3
inhibitor (10 Amol/L cilostamide) indicated that PDE3 enzymes do not control the
cAMP pool that regulates proliferation on stimulation with forskolin. D, PDE4
inhibition (10 Amol/L rolipram) in combination with a low forskolin concentration
(1 Amol/L) completely inhibited the proliferation of KM12C cells, whereas
neither agent alone (at these concentrations) was able to do this. Points, mean of

with the cell-permeant cAMP analogue 8-pMeOPT-2¶-O-Me-cAMP,
which selectively activates Epac rather than PKA, did not result in
growth suppression (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, treatment with the
nonselective PDE inhibitor I-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (IBMX;
100 Amol/L), the specific PDE3 inhibitor cilostamide (10 Amol/L),
or the specific PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (10 Amol/L), at concen-

trations known to induce selective PDE inhibition (7, 9, 12), did not
cause growth cessation (Fig. 1A).
We next titrated the action of forskolin and found that 1 Amol/L
forskolin gave rise to f50% inhibition of KM12C cell growth
(Fig. 1B). We therefore used this ‘‘low dose’’ of forskolin to look for
potential synergistic action with inhibitors specific for the PDE3
and PDE4 families because these are collectively responsible for
f35% of cAMP-hydrolyzing activity in KM12C cells (Supplementary Table S1). We found that the PDE3-selective inhibitor
cilostamide, when used at a dose known to maximally inhibit
PDE3 (10 Amol/L; ref. 12), did not potentiate low-dose (1 Amol/L)
forskolin–induced growth suppression (Fig. 1C). In marked
contrast to this, addition of rolipram at a dose (10 Amol/L) known
to maximally inhibit PDE4 (7, 10) enhanced the growth suppression
induced by 1 Amol/L forskolin (Fig. 1D); rolipram plus low-dose
forskolin caused complete growth cessation of KM12C cells,
despite rolipram having no effect on its own. Statistical analysis
of the data indicated that there was no significant difference
between control and rolipram (P > 0.09) for all time points;
however, for control versus forskolin (P < 0.03), forskolin versus
forskolin/rolipram (P < 0.02), and control versus forskolin/rolipram
(P < 0.02), the data were deemed statistically significant from day 2
onward. Thus, under conditions of submaximal adenylyl cyclase
activity, inhibition of specific cAMP-hydrolyzing PDE4 can suppress
growth regulatory pathways in KM12C cells. The profound growth
arrest is intriguing because these cancer cells are resistant to
cytotoxic agents and to inhibitors of the major oncogenic Src and
Ras pathways.4 We may therefore have uncovered an apparent
‘‘Achilles heel’’ for these chemoresistant cancer cells.
Effects of forskolin and rolipram on cell cycle regulators.
Next, we addressed known regulators of the G1-S transition in
response to five conditions: (a) DMSO vehicle control; (b) highdose (50 Amol/L) forskolin, which alone blocks KM12C cell
proliferation; (c) low-dose (1 Amol/L) forskolin, which only
suppresses proliferation by f50%; (d) low-dose (10 Amol/L)
rolipram, which does not affect proliferation; and (e) the combined
low doses of both forskolin (1 Amol/L) and rolipram (10 Amol/L;
forskolin/rolipram), which causes complete growth cessation
(Fig. 1). These treatments were used throughout of the remainder
of this study to investigate mechanism of action.
We found no consistent difference in p21CIP1 expression induced
by forskolin or rolipram (Fig. 2A, top). However, p27KIP1 expression
was increased by treatments that blocked proliferation, particularly
by high-dose forskolin and the synergistic low-dose combination of
forskolin/rolipram (Fig. 2A, middle, lanes 2 and 5). In addition,
Skp2, an oncogenic F-box protein component of the SCF ubiquitin
ligase complex, which is known to target p27KIP1 for proteosomal
degradation (25), is regulated in a reciprocal manner to p27KIP
(Fig. 2B, top, lanes 2 and 5); Skp2 protein expression is reduced
when p27KIP1 is enhanced after treatment with high-dose forskolin
or the low-dose forskolin/rolipram combination (Fig. 2B, top, lanes
2 and 5). This suggests that the mechanism by which p27KIP1
accumulates during cell cycle withdrawal may be due, at least in
part, to loss of Skp2-mediated degradation. As expected, the
induction of p27KIP1 was paralleled by loss of phosphorylated pRb
(and reduced pRb expression) as well as decreased expression of
the pRb/E2F-regulated cyclins A, B1, and E, together with their

kinase partner CDK1 (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 5). These results imply
that high-dose forskolin and the low-dose forskolin/rolipram
combination induce cell cycle arrest via inhibition of the pRb/
cyclin/CDK pathway, which normally controls progression through
G1-S phase of the cell cycle, and that this is via stabilization of
p27KIP1.
Low-dose forskolin causes cell cycle arrest and primes
KM12C cells for rolipram-induced apoptosis. To complement
the results of the proliferation assays (Fig. 1) and analysis of cell
cycle regulators (Fig. 2), we next cultured cells in the combination
of cAMP-modulating agents for 24 h and then pulsed with BrdUrd
during the final hour. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and
analyzed by flow cytometry to determine BrdUrd incorporation
into the DNA at various cell cycle stages. In keeping with the
antiproliferative effects observed by MTT assays, quantification of
BrdUrd incorporation showed that high-dose forskolin and the
low-dose combination of forskolin/rolipram ( forskolin/rolipram)
caused a partial G1 arrest, with f20% of cells still in S phase
(Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, low-dose (1 Amol/L) forskolin caused a
similar G1 arrest although these cultures were still able to grow to
f50% of control cells in proliferation assays (Fig. 1). To investigate
the reason why high-dose forskolin and low-dose forskolin/
rolipram cause complete growth cessation whereas low-dose
forskolin–treated cultures can still proliferate, albeit more slowly,

we examined cell viability. Cells were treated with the cAMPmodulating agent combinations for 24, 48, or 72 h, and the cells
were fixed and stained with propidium iodide (Fig. 3A) or an
Annexin V-FITC conjugate (Fig. 3B) and analyzed by flow
cytometry to detect apoptotic cells. Quantification and statistical
analysis of sub-2n DNA by propidium iodide (Fig. 3C) and Annexin
V staining (Fig. 3D) showed that whereas both high-dose (50 Amol/L)
and low-dose (1 Amol/L) forskolin caused G1 arrest (Fig. 2D), only
high-dose forskolin–treated cells were apoptotic. In contrast to
low-dose forskolin alone or rolipram alone, the low-dose forskolin/
rolipram combination caused both G1 arrest and apoptosis that
was statistically significant from 48 h onward (P < 0.05) when
compared with 1 Amol/L forskolin alone (Fig. 2D, quantified in
Fig. 3C and D). This correlates with the data in Fig. 1D, in which
a statistically significant difference in the proliferation between
1 Amol/L forskolin alone versus forskolin/rolipram combination is
observed from day 2 onward and reflects the increase in apoptosis
observed in forskolin/rolipram–treated cells (Fig. 3C and D). These
data indicate that low-dose forskolin not only causes G1 arrest but
also primes KM12C cells to die, presumably from the G1 arrested
population, on addition of the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (Fig. 3).
Challenge with rolipram alone did not cause apoptosis (Fig. 3). This
suggests that the combination of low-dose forskolin/rolipram can
arrest and kill chemoresistant KM12C colon cancer cells. This

10 Amol/L rolipram (FSK/rolipram; lane 5 ),
and the protein levels of various cell
cycle regulators were analyzed via
immunoblotting with specific antibodies as
probes. A, high forskolin and forskolin/
rolipram combination treatment increases
p27KIP1 (middle, lanes 2 and 5) but does
not affect p21CIP1 levels (top ). B, forskolin
and forskolin/rolipram treatment causes
a decrease in levels of the SCF ubiquitin

raises the exciting possibility that such combinations of relatively
low doses of cAMP-elevating agents may provide a means of
inhibiting the growth of some advanced cancer cells, which are
otherwise extremely difficult to kill. This also indicates that KM12C
cell viability and growth requires maintenance of cAMP at low
levels, at least in the compartments that are regulated by PDE4.
Low-dose forskolin/rolipram works by suppressing PI3K
signaling. Because the PI3K pathway plays a major role in
regulating cell growth and survival (26), we examined whether it
was important for continued proliferation of KM12C cells and
whether it impinged on the novel, cAMP-induced, inhibitory effects
on survival. Intriguingly, we found that GFP-PH [used as a reporter

of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) localization;
ref. 22] was displaced from its normal membrane localization in
cells treated with either high-dose forskolin (P < 0.05, compared
with control) or the low-dose forskolin/rolipram combination (P <
0.05, compared with 1 Amol/L forskolin alone), but not with
rolipram alone (P > 0.09; Fig. 4A, quantified in Fig. 4B). We saw
similar displacement of the membrane-proximal location of the
PI3K regulatory subunit p85a on treatment with forskolin or the
lower-dose forskolin/rolipram combination (data not shown).
These data indicate that under growth inhibitory cAMP-elevating
conditions, there was loss of membrane-associated PI3K and PIP3.
In addition, low-dose forskolin/rolipram combination treatment

led to a rapid dephosphorylation of the PI3K/PIP3–regulated protein
kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) at Ser473 (Fig. 5A). Moreover,
although the biological effects of cAMP-elevating agents were long
term and sustained, suppression of Akt/PKB phosphorylation was
evident between 5 and 10 min after drug addition (Fig. 5A).
Decreased phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, at both Ser473 and Thr308,
which are known to regulate Akt/PKB activity (27), correlated with
cell death induced by high-dose forskolin or the low-dose forskolin/
rolipram combination (Fig. 5B). We confirmed the implied necessity
for the PI3K/Akt pathway for continued proliferation and survival
of KM12C cells by showing that the PI3K inhibitory drug LY294002
recapitulated the growth inhibitory effects induced by forskolin
or the low-dose forskolin/rolipram combination (Fig. 5C). Indeed,
more detailed analysis indicated that 20 Amol/L LY294002 caused
G1 arrest, with <20% of cells still incorporating BrdUrd (Supplementary Fig. S1A, quantified in Fig. 5D), and also resulted in

accumulation of cells with sub-2n DNA content when compared
with DMSO-treated controls (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In keeping
with a similar mechanism of action, LY294002 also induced p27KIP1,
inhibited pRb phosphorylation, and reduced the expression of
cyclins A, B1, and E and CDK1, effects that were similar to the
forskolin/rolipram combination (Supplementary Fig. S2). These
data show that PI3K membrane localization and phosphorylation
of Akt/PKB were strongly inhibited by the low-dose forskolin/
rolipram combination, and this is almost certainly how these agents
induce growth arrest and cell death.
PTEN reexpression suppresses growth at low density and
sensitizes KM12C cells to forskolin. To determine whether
known oncogenic or tumor suppressor regulators of the PI3K
pathway influenced KM12C cell growth, we examined cells in
which either PTEN or Src had been modulated by exogenous
expression. Src, which positively regulates PI3K (28), is commonly

activated, or overexpressed, in late-stage colon cancer cells
(29, 30), whereas PTEN, which acts as a PIP3 lipid phosphatase
to down-regulate the PI3K pathway (19), is frequently lost or
mutated (26). We found that overexpressing a constitutively active
Src-Y527F mutant did not alter the growth properties of KM12C
colon cancer cells (specifically in KM12C/2C4 cells described in
ref. 20; data not shown). However, reexpression of PTEN, the
expression of which is lost in these cells, slows down growth rate of
KM12C/2C4, particularly evident at lower cell densities (Fig. 6B),
with accumulation of cells in G1 (Fig. 6C). Reexpression of PTEN
resulted in reduced Akt/PKB phosphorylation to levels found in
colon cancer cells that have retained PTEN expression (shown for
HT29 cells in Fig. 6A). However, although PTEN-mediated control
of the PI3K/Akt pathway was restored, this did not result in
complete growth cessation or cell death induced by complete loss
of phospho-AKT caused by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Together,
these data provide support for a critical role for the PI3K pathway
in KM12C proliferation, presumably mediated, at least in part, by
PTEN loss (Fig. 6A and B). Interestingly, we found that reexpression
of PTEN resulted in a 4-fold greater inhibition of cell proliferation
in the presence of 1 Amol/L forskolin (or 0.5 Amol/L forskolin;
Fig. 6D).
Sensitivity to growth inhibition by cAMP modulation is not
restricted to KM12C cells. In considering the potential therapeutic benefit of any new strategy (e.g., the potentiating low-dose
combination of cAMP modulators), it is important to test whether
the observed effects are not particular to one cell line, in this case
KM12C colon cancer cells. We therefore examined a number for
their ability to be growth inhibited by the low-dose forskolin/
rolipram combination. Of the 11 cancer cell lines tested, 3 of these
(KM12C, MCF7, and HT29) were extremely sensitive to forskolin/

rolipram, displaying f80% inhibition of proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Another five cell lines (A431, WiDr, RKO, A375, and
H630) were partially sensitive, displaying between 40% and 60%
inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S3B), whereas three cell lines
(Du145, SW480, and SW620) were all insensitive to forskolin/
rolipram–induced growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Thus, there is a subset of cancer cells that respond to a greater or
lesser extent to the forskolin/rolipram combination (8 of 11 in our
study), implying that a significant proportion of cancer cells may be
sensitive to this type of growth modulation.
Interestingly, we found that the sensitive cells were also highly
sensitive to treatment with LY294002, whereas the forskolin/
rolipram–resistant cancer cell lines were relatively insensitive to
LY294002 (Supplementary Fig. S3A and C), showing a consistent
link between sensitivity to cAMP modulation and PI3K dependence.

Discussion
Cancer cells, despite having many genetic, epigenetic, and
chromosomal abnormalities, are often addicted to one or two
oncogenic changes for continued proliferation and survival (31).
Major therapeutic advances are likely to come from molecular
profiling the oncogenic addictions of individual tumors. This would
in turn allow tailored therapy to be more widely applied. There are
now a number of spectacular examples of agents that attack
critical molecular events having therapeutic benefit. For example,
in non–small-cell lung cancer, a subset of patients with activating
mutations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) exhibit impressive clinical responses to the EGFR
inhibitor gefitinib (32). In this case, oncogene addiction is a result

Figure 6. Exogenous expression of PTEN slows KM12C growth rate and sensitizes to forskolin/rolipram. Cells were plated at low density (5  105 in 60-mm2 dish)
for analysis. A, KM12C cells do not express PTEN and reintroduction restores lower phospho-Akt (Ser473) levels. Expression of endogenous PTEN in HT29 colon
cancer cells and PTEN-GFP in KM12C/2C4 (top ) correlates with reduced phospho-Akt (pAkt; Ser473), whereas lack of PTEN in KM12C and KM12C/2C4 cells
correlates with increased phospho-Akt. Immunoblots were carried out with the specific PTEN and Akt antibodies as probes. B, reintroduction of PTEN affects
low-density growth of KM12 cells. Proliferation of KM12C, KM12C/2C4, and KM12C/2C4 PTEN-GFP cells was monitored with an MTT assay over a 6-d period.

of mutation, not simply overexpression or inappropriate cellular
activation, and it is thought that addiction may be mediated by
constitutive activation of the prosurvival Akt/PKB pathway
downstream of activated EGFR (33). Other clear examples of
clinical benefit arising from the targeting of critical oncogenes
come from treatment of breast cancers, in which the HER2
receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed, with the monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin; ref. 34) and the use of imatinib
(Gleevec) to treat chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal
stromal tumors that are driven by the oncogenic BCR-Abl and c-Kit
proteins, respectively (35). It is likely that identification of tumor
oncogene addiction will thus provide a key part of delivering
effective cancer treatments in the future.
Here, we establish for the first time that KM12C colon cancer
cells, which are resistant to cell death induced by DNA-damaging
or other cytotoxic agents commonly used to treat colorectal
cancers,4 are critically dependent on the PI3K pathway for their
continued proliferation and survival. The PI3K pathway is
frequently deregulated in cancer through a variety of mechanisms,
including PTEN loss (reviewed in ref. 36), as in KM12C cells, or
activating mutations in PI3Ka (37). One consequence of such
mutations is activation of downstream effectors, including Akt/
PKB and mammalian target of rapamycin (reviewed in ref. 38),

www.aacrjournals.org

which promote proliferation and cell survival. In cancer cells, such
as KM12C, which are addicted to the PI3K pathway, there is an
urgent need to devise effective, yet relatively nontoxic, ways to
inhibit tumor cell growth and survival. In this regard, inhibitors of
PI3K have been developed with against various classes of PI3K (39),
although these drugs are not particularly specific (40). Although
there is optimism that ongoing efforts will lead to selective
isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors as therapeutic agents, these are
neither readily available nor at an advanced stage of clinical
development (41).
Whereas reexpression of PTEN reduces phosphorylation of Akt/
PKB and causes slowed proliferation at low density (Fig. 6), it does
not recapitulate complete growth cessation and cell death induced
by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 5C and D and Supplementary
Fig. S2). This implies that although loss of PTEN is a contributing
factor to the apparent dependence of KM12C cells on PI3K, other
mechanisms may also operate. Intriguingly, we show here that
KM12C cells can also be efficiently growth arrested and killed by a
low-dose combination of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin
and the PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram (Figs. 1, 2D, and 3), but
not by forskolin and the PDE3-selective inhibitor cilostamide. Such
selectivity is consistent with the now well-established notion that
cAMP signaling is compartmentalized in cells, with PDE3 and

PDE4 activities contributing to distinct functional compartments
(6, 7, 9).
In evaluating the mechanism of action of forskolin/rolipram on
these cells, we found induced rapid and sustained inhibition of the
PI3K pathway, as judged by displacement of a GFP-PH domain (Akt
PH) protein (reporting PIP3; Fig. 4), and inhibition of Akt/PKB
phosphorylation on both Ser473 and Thr308 residues. Although we
do not yet know the precise mechanism by which specific cAMP
pools are mediating PIP3 displacement, it is noteworthy that PKA
has been shown to phosphorylate p85a on Ser83 and that this
contributes to PKA-induced growth arrest (42). cAMP can also
block the membrane localization of PDK1, an upstream activator
of Akt/PKB (43). The forskolin/rolipram–induced inhibition of
the PI3K pathway shown here is associated with clear changes
in cell cycle regulators, including reduced Skp2, which is linked
to induction of p27KIP1, together with the dephosphorylation
and reduced expression of pRb, cyclins A, B1, and E, and CDK1
(Fig. 2A–C). Such key changes, commonly associated with negative
regulation of progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle
(17, 44), are consistent with the observed accumulation of cells in
G1 (Fig. 2D). In addition, whereas low-dose forskolin (1 Amol/L)
can, by itself, induce a partial G1 arrest (Fig. 2D), the coapplication
of rolipram (10 Amol/L), which has no effect on its own, potentiates
the effects of low-dose forskolin to cause growth-arrested cells to
undergo apoptosis (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data imply that
whereas submaximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in KM12C
colon cancer cells is sufficient to cause a partial growth arrest, it
also primes cells for cell death on further elevation of cAMP in
subcellular compartments that are specifically controlled by PDE4
rather than PDE3. This offers a unique opportunity for therapeutic
exploitation. Whereas both PDE3 inhibitors and high-dose
colforsin daropate, a water-soluble forskolin derivative, exert
potent positive inotropic effects on heart, no such actions are
evident using PDE4-selective inhibitors (45), which is consistent
with PDE3 and PDE4 controlling distinct intracellular compartments also in cardiac myocytes (6, 9). Consistent with this, PDE4selective inhibitors, which have undergone clinical trials for
treating inflammatory lung disease, have shown no inotropic or
chronotropic effects on cardiac function (10, 45). Thus, a
combination therapy of low-dose forskolin coupled with a PDE4
inhibitor may provide a novel means of treating various colon
cancers without associated cardiac toxicity.
We have here discovered a novel way of inhibiting the PI3K
pathway by a synergistic combination of relatively low doses of
cAMP modulators. Our data suggest that we have found another
Achilles heel for these chemoresistant cancer cells: that these cells
also critically require PDE4 activity, presumably during the normal
adenylyl cyclase/PDE cycle that controls cAMP production and
degradation in a localized manner. Thus, PDE4 inhibition, under
conditions when adenylyl cyclase activity is stimulated endogenously, results in the death of these colon cancer cells, which
display chemoresistance that is extremely hard to overcome. Such

a novel addiction to maintenance of low levels of cAMP in the
appropriate subcellular locations, via PDE4 activity, is required to
maintain signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. This, as we
show here, is needed for the proliferation and survival of KM12C
cells. It is interesting that by bringing it back under the normal
regulatory control exerted by PTEN, the PI3K/Akt pathway acts to
sensitize the cells to complete growth cessation and death
induced by cAMP modulation, as shown by the enhanced
responses to low doses of forskolin that do not normally kill
these cells (Fig. 6).
To evaluate the generality of our discovery, we probed a number of
cancer cells with forskolin/rolipram combinations. In doing this,
we found that 8 of 11 of such cell lines were growth inhibited by
the forskolin/rolipram combination to a greater or lesser extent
(Supplementary Fig. S3). In particular, three of these cell lines were
extremely sensitive to growth inhibition by forskolin/rolipram,
suggesting that a significant number of cancer cells may be addicted
to the need to maintain low levels of cAMP in the compartment
regulated by PDE4. These data raise the exciting possibility that
relatively low-dose combinations of (a) pharmacologic agonists that
could prime adenylyl cyclase and (b) PDE4 inhibitors, which are
undergoing clinical testing in other disease contexts, may have
therapeutic benefit in treating advanced colon cancers that are
refractory to existing cytotoxic therapies.
In summary, misregulation of signaling proteins occurs in many
cancers, leading to distorted circuitry and the establishment of
oncogene addiction to one or more signal transduction pathways.
It is becoming clear that the identification of such addictions can
provide therapeutic opportunities, and so understanding the
molecular events driving oncogene addiction, and hence tumor
cell proliferation and survival, is becoming increasingly important.
Here, we identify for the first time two ‘‘addictions’’ of chemoresistant cancer cells. Both of these addictions are required for
maintenance of cell proliferation and survival (i.e., activation of the
PI3K pathway and the need to maintain low cAMP levels in
compartments regulated by PDE4, which itself mediates effects on
the PI3K/Akt pathway). We have therefore identified a key point of
cross-regulation of two major second messenger–regulated pathways in these cells, those controlled by cAMP and PIP3, which are
critical for cancer cell viability. This raises the exciting possibility
that the adenylyl cyclase/PDE4 axis may be exploited for
therapeutic benefit.
