Abstract
Activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and inactivation of
wild-type p53 by Mdm2 overexpression are frequent molecular
events in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We investigated
the interaction of Raf/MEK/ERK and p53 pathways after their
simultaneous blockades using a selective small-molecule
antagonist of Mdm2, Nutlin-3a, and a pharmacologic MEKspecific inhibitor, PD98059. We found that PD98059, which
itself has minimal apoptogenic activity, acts synergistically
with Nutlin-3a to induce apoptosis in wild-type p53 AML cell
lines OCI-AML-3 and MOLM-13. Interestingly, PD98059 enhanced nuclear proapototic function of p53 in these cells. In
accordance with the activation of transcription-dependent
apoptosis, PD98059 treatment promoted the translocation of
p53 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in OCI-AML-3 cells, in
which p53 primarily initiates transcription-independent apoptosis when cells are treated with Nutlin-3a alone. The critical
role of p53 localization in cells with increased p53 levels was
supported by enhanced apoptosis induction in cells cotreated
with Nutlin-3a and the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B.
PD98059 prevented p53-mediated induction of p21 at the
transcriptional level. The repressed expression of antiapototic
p21 also seemed to contribute to synergism between PD98059
and Nutlin-3a because (a) the synergistic apoptogenic effect
was preserved in G1 cells, (b) p53-mediated induction of p21
was preferentially seen in G1 cells, (c) PD98059 strongly
antagonized p21 induction by Nutlin-3a, and (d) cells with
high p21 levels were resistant to apoptosis. This is the first
report showing that the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway regulates
the subcellular localization of p53 and the relative contribution of transcription-dependent and transcription-independent pathways in p53-mediated apoptosis. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Malignancies develop when the delicate balance between cell
cycle, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis is disrupted by
genetic and/or environmental cues (1). The Ras-activated Raf/
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) pathway promotes growth and prevents
apoptosis of hematopoietic cells, and its constitutive activation
has been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of acute

myelogenous leukemia (AML; ref. 2). We and others have shown
constitutive ERK activation in f70% of clinical AML specimens
(3–5). We have shown that treatment of AML blasts with MEK
inhibitors PD98059 or PD184352 (CI-1040) inhibits cell growth
and proliferation and induces modest apoptosis (3). p53 is a
transcription factor that plays an important role in the cellular
response to DNA damage either by causing damaged cells to
undergo apoptosis or by inducing cell cycle arrest to allow DNA
repair (6). p53 is the most frequently inactivated protein in human
malignancies, and more than 50% of all solid tumors carry
mutations in the TP53 gene (7). In AML, TP53 mutations are rare,
but inactivation of wild-type p53 protein frequently occurs through
overexpression of its negative regulator Mdm2 (8–10). Mdm2 binds
p53 at the transactivation domain of p53 and blocks its ability
to activate transcription, serves as a ubiquitin ligase that promotes
p53 degradation, and furthermore, mediates the nuclear export of
p53 (11). Recently, we have reported that the Mdm2 antagonist
Nutlin-3a strongly inhibits growth and induces p53-mediated
apoptosis in AML (8) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (12).
The Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade has been shown to
functionally interact with the p53 pathway (13–22). Although
details of this interaction are largely unknown, central to the
prosurvival effect of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling on p53 is the upregulation of Mdm2 (15, 16). Raf/MEK/ERK signaling controls
Mdm2 expression by transcriptional activation (15) and positive
regulation of the nuclear export of Mdm2 mRNA (16). On the
contrary, the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade can induce the expression of
p14ARF, an Mdm2 antagonist, resulting in p53 activation (15). This
can be an important block to cancer progression, and p14ARF
expression is lost in various types of malignancies including AML
(17, 18). The contradictory induction of p14ARF and Mdm2 seems to
account for the Raf/MEK/ERK-dependent attenuation of p53 in the
absence of p14ARF or when Mdm2 exceeds that of p14ARF (15).
The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway also interferes with p53-dependent
cell cycle regulation. Activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
leads to robust induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p21Waf1/Cip1 (hereafter referred as p21), whereas its blockade results
in reduced expression of p21 (3, 19–22). p21 is one of the major
downstream transcriptional targets of p53, which negatively
regulates G1-S transition of the cell cycle (6). p21 has also been
shown to be a negative regulator of p53-dependent apoptosis (23).
p53 is a very unstable protein, with a half-life ranging from 5 to
30 min, which is present at low cellular levels owing to continuous
degradation largely mediated by Mdm2. p53 activation can be
modulated at three levels: (a) an increase in p53 concentration by
elongated half-life; (b) the transformation of the p53 protein from a
latent to an active conformation; and (c) the translocation of the
p53 protein from the cytosol to the nucleus or to the mitochondria
(24–26). The transcriptional activation of p53 target genes occurs

in the nucleus. p53 transcriptionally induces the proapoptotic BH3only proteins Noxa and Puma, which indirectly promote Bax/Bak
activation by inhibiting the functions of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 or
Bcl-XL (26). Noxa and Puma are key mediators of p53-induced
apoptosis. p53 can also trigger mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization and apoptosis in the absence of transcription,
through direct activation of Bax or Bak or through binding to Bcl-2
or Bcl-XL (26–28). Although a number of studies have been done to
elucidate the modulation of p53 activity at the first two levels, few
have addressed the regulation of p53 localization. Recently, we have
reported that two distinct mechanisms, transcription-dependent
and transcription-independent apoptosis, are both operational in
p53-mediated apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary AML cells
(8). We have also shown that Mdm2 inhibition–induced p53
primarily executes transcription-dependent and transcriptionindependent apoptosis in MOLM-13 and OCI-AML-3 cells,
respectively (8). In accordance with the difference in mechanism,
the nuclear accumulation of p53 was much less pronounced in
OCI-AML-3 cells compared with MOLM-13 cells. Because the p53mediated apoptosis pathway was well preserved in both OCI-AML3 and MOLM-13 cells, these cells seemed to provide useful models
for analyzing an association of the regulation of p53 localization
with apoptosis.
In this study, we investigated the molecular events after
simultaneous blockade of Raf/MEK/ERK and the p53 pathways
in AML cells, to investigate the potential therapeutic utility of this
strategy. We found that (a) PD98059 promotes translocation of
Nutlin-induced p53 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and
enhances transcription-dependent apoptosis and (b) PD98059
inhibits p53-dependent induction of p21 in G1-phase cells,
interfering with the p21-mediated cell protection programs against
p53-mediated apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. The MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, the phosphoinositide-3kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, and the chromosomal region
maintenance 1 (Crm1)–mediated nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B
were purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Other reagents
were obtained as described (8). All compounds except for leptomycin B,
which is supplied in 70% methanol, were dissolved in DMSO and kept
frozen at 20jC. The final DMSO concentration in the medium did not
exceed 0.1% (vol/vol). At this concentration, DMSO itself had no effect up
to 72 h on cell growth or viability of the AML cells used in this study. In
some experiments, cells were preincubated for 1 h with 3.5 Amol/L
cycloheximide or 200 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK.
Antibodies. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antip53 (FL-393; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); mouse monoclonal
anti–phospho-p53 (Ser15; 16G8; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA);
rabbit polyclonal anti–phospho-p53 (Thr18; Cell Signaling Technology);
mouse monoclonal anti-Mdm2 (D-12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse
monoclonal anti-p21 (Ab-1; EMD Biosciences); mouse monoclonal anti-p27
(G173-524; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA); mouse monoclonal anti-Noxa
(114C307; EMD Biosciences); rabbit polyclonal anti-Puma (EMD Biosciences); rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax against amino acids 43 to 61 (BD
Biosciences); mouse monoclonal anti-Bax (YTH-6A7; Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD); rabbit polyclonal anti–Bcl-XL (BD Biosciences); mouse

OR); rabbit polyclonal anti-Crm1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse
monoclonal anti–tip associating protein (anti-Tap) (BD Biosciences); and
mouse monoclonal anti–h-actin (AC-74; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO).
Cell lines and cell cultures. Three human AML cell lines were cultured
in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS. OCI-AML-3 and MOLM13 cells have wild-type p53, whereas p53 is disabled in HL-60 by large
deletion of the TP53 (8). Cell lines were harvested in log-phase growth,
seeded at a density of 2  105 cells/mL and exposed to the Nutlin-3a and/or
PD98059. In experiments involving combinations of Nutlin-3a and PD98059,
OCI-AML-3 and HL-60 cells were treated with Nutlin-3a at 0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10
Amol/L and MOLM-13 cells at 0, 0.4, 1, 2, and 4 Amol/L, in the absence or
presence of 20 Amol/L PD98059. The two agents were added simultaneously
to cells, and they were cultured for 24 h. Cell viability was evaluated by
triplicate counts of trypan blue dye–excluding cells. Experiments were done
at least in duplicate.
Annexin V staining. Evaluation of apoptosis by the Annexin Vpropidium iodide (PI) binding assay was done as described (8). In some
experiments, Annexin V–stained cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde
and prepared for cell cycle analysis or intracellular molecule detection as
described below.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were permeabilized in 70% ice-cold ethanol,
incubated overnight with PI solution (25 Ag/mL PI) and analyzed as
described previously (8). Data were gated on the FL2-area versus FL2-width
cytogram to exclude doublets and aggregates, and a minimum of 1  105
gated cells was collected per sample. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed
using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME).
Quantitation of intracellular protein by flow cytometry. For
intracellular protein detection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized with 100% ice-cold methanol, and incubated overnight at
4jC with primary antibodies. For detection of Bax in its active
conformation (clone YTH-6A7), cellular fixation and permeabilization was
done using the Dako IntraStain kit (DAKO Cytomation), according to
manufacturer’s instructions. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa
Fluor 488 chicken anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies
(Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 4jC. Appropriate isotypic controls were
included. If necessary, cells were further stained with PI for simultaneous
DNA content analysis.
Western blot analysis. An equal amount of protein lysate was placed
on 12% SDS-PAGE for 2 h at 70 V. Proteins were transferred to Hybond-P
membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), immunoblotted with
appropriate antibodies, and were reacted with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were detected by
phosphoimager Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). An
anti–h-actin blot was used in parallel as a loading control. Visualized blots
were analyzed by the public-domain NIH image 1.63 program, and
protein/h-actin ratios were calculated. All Western blots were done at
least in duplicate.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescence
and confocal microscopic examination was done as previously described
(8), with minor modifications. In brief, cells were fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with ice-cold 100% methanol. The
cells were blocked in 5% normal goat serum for 30 min, followed by
incubation overnight at 4jC with rabbit polyclonal anti-p53 antibodies
FL-393 (1:100 v/v; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse monoclonal anti–
cytochrome c oxidase IV (10G8; 1 Ag/mL; Molecular Probes). After washing,
cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 chicken anti-rabbit secondary
antibody and Alexa Fluor 594 chicken anti-mouse secondary antibody
(Molecular Probes) diluted in 5% normal goat serum for 30 min at 4jC.
Nuclei were counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Real-time quantitative PCR. OCI-AML-3 cells were treated with 20
Amol/L PD98059 and/or 5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a for 3 h. RNA was prepared from
cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and first-strand cDNA
was generated using random hexamers (SuperScript III First-Strand
Synthesis SuperMix; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) from 1 Ag total RNA. The
mRNA expression levels of p21, Mdm2, Noxa, ABL, and 18S were quantified
using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Quantitative real-time PCR was done using an ABI Prism 7500 Sequence

Detection System and TaqMan Universal Master Mix. The reaction
was initiated by a hold for 10 min at 95jC followed by 40 cycles 15 s at
95jC and 1 min at 60jC. Two probes for 18S (Hs99999901_s1) and p21
(Hs00355782_m1) were used. The specificity of the PCR products was
confirmed by melting curve analysis with ABI SDS 2.0 software. Relative
expression levels were calculated based on the difference in C T values
between the test samples and control untreated cells. This was normalized
with expression levels of 18S using the equation E target(C Ttesttarget
C Tcontroltarget)/E ref(C Ttestref C Tcontrolref ). The real-time PCR experiments were
carried out in triplicate.
Statistical analysis. The statistical analysis was done using the twotailed Student’s t test. Statistical significance was considered when P < 0.05.
Unless otherwise indicated, average values were expressed as mean F SD.

Results
Antileukemia activity of Mdm2 antagonists in AML cells is
enhanced by combination with MEK inhibitor PD98059. First,
we examined the combination effect of the Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin3a and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 on the growth and viability of
cultured AML cell lines OCI-AML-3 and MOLM-13 that have wildtype p53 and high levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (3, 8). As
described previously (3), treatment of cells with PD98059 alone
showed minimal cytotoxic effect (Fig. 1A). Cells were treated with a
range of concentrations of PD98059 (1–100 Amol/L). The net
increase in the proportion of Annexin V-binding cells was <10%,
and the cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye-excluding

cells more than 90% even after 48-h exposure of 100 Amol/L
PD98059. Next, to determine if MEK inhibition might potentiate
cytotoxic effects of Nutlin-3a, we combined 20 Amol/L PD98059
with a range of concentrations of Nutlin-3a. PD98059 at 20 Amol/L
sufficiently reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in these cells
(f50% decrease at 24 h). The interaction study showed
a potentiation effect of PD98059 on Nutlin-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 1A) and growth inhibition (data not shown). The potentiation effect of PD98059 on Nutlin-induced apoptosis seemed
higher in OCI-AML-3 cells than in MOLM-13 cells, being
consistent with experiments using different concentrations of
concomitant Nutlin-3a and PD98059 or their sequential administration with a 3-h interval (data not shown). The sequence
Nutlin-3a followed by PD98059 yielded identical results as the
reverse sequence. Such a potentiation effect was not seen in p53defective HL-60 cells (data not shown). The reduced activity of
Nutlin-3a and PD98059 combination in MOLM-13 cells may be
related to the predominant nuclear localization of p53 in these
cells at baseline, as we reported (8).
PD98059 enhances p53-mediated transcription-dependent
apoptosis. Because PD98059 itself had minimal apoptogenic effect,
we hypothesized that MEK inhibition could actively enhance p53
signaling. Irrespective of transcription-dependent or transcriptionindependent pathways, p53 signaling activates the proapoptotic
protein Bax, resulting in Bax conformational change (29).

(OCI-AML-3 cells) or 2 Amol/L (MOLM-13

agents or in combination (PD + 3a),
and Bax conformational change was
determined by staining with the active
conformation-specific anti-Bax antibody
YTH-6A7 or a corresponding isotype
control (shaded ). To block caspase
activation-mediated conformational change
of Bax, cells were preincubated for 1 h
with 200 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK. Results are
representative of three independent
experiments.

5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a. Addition of PD98059 enhanced accumulation of p53 and Noxa induction and blunted p53-dependent Mdm2 and p21 up-regulation. pERK, p44/42

of DMSO, 3.5 Amol/L cycloheximide, 10 Amol/L Nutlin-3a, or a combination of cycloheximide and Nutlin-3a. Annexin V–positive fractions and Dw m were assessed
by flow cytometry. Columns, mean of triplicate measurements; bars, SD. Comparable results were obtained in two other independent experiments.

Involvement of Bax conformational change was analyzed in OCIAML-3 cells by means of an antibody directed against the NH2terminal region of Bax (clone YTH-6A7). The epitope-specific antibody
can react only with Bax in active conformation because the NH2terminal region is occluded in unstressed intact cells (30). Cells were
preincubated in the presence of 200 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK before
the addition of 20 Amol/L PD98059, 5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a, or both to
inhibit caspase activation-mediated Bax cleavage (31). As shown in
Fig. 1B, few control cells were stained with this antibody (2.2 F 0.2%),
and PD98059 did not induce conformational change of Bax (2.8 F
0.2%). As predicted, an increase in the percentage of Bax-positive
cells was seen following incubation with Nutlin-3a (9.2 F 0.5%).

www.aacrjournals.org

Interestingly, PD98059 considerably enhanced Bax conformational
change by Nutlin-3a (29.8 F 1.2%), suggesting that MEK inhibition
actively enhances the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The
enhancement of Nutlin-induced Bax conformational change by
PD98059 was also seen in MOLM-13 cells, although the effect was
less prominent than in OCI-AML-3 cells (Fig. 1B). When Bax antibodies directed against amino acids 43 to 61 were used, no differences
in the fluorescence pattern between control and drug-treated cells
were observed (data not shown).
To clarify the molecular events that contribute to Bax activation,
we cultured OCI-AML-3 cells in the presence of 20 or 100 Amol/L
PD98059 for 24 h and investigated expression levels of p53-related

proteins and p27Kip1 (hereafter referred to as p27). As shown in
Fig. 2A, p53-related protein levels did not change significantly,
whereas PD98059 induced p27. It has been shown that MEK
inhibition causes cell cycle arrest at G1 to p27 induction,
respectively (3). Treatment with PD98059 did not induce p53
phosphorylation at Thr18 ( figure not shown). Next, we investigated
time course expression of p53-related proteins in OCI-AML-3 cells
after exposure to 5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a in the absence or presence of
18-h preincubation of 20 Amol/L PD98059. Nutlin-3a increased
cellular p53 level and induced increased expression of Mdm2, Noxa,
and p21 (Fig. 2B), as previously reported in detail (8). Interestingly,
addition of PD98059 enhanced accumulation of p53 and Noxa
induction, whereas it inhibited p53-dependent Mdm2 and p21 upregulation (Fig. 2B). The levels of total and Ser70-phosphorylated
Bcl-2 were not affected by the presence of PD98059, suggesting a
minor role of Bcl-2 in the enhancement of Nutlin-induced

apoptosis (32). PD98059 pretreatment resulted in reduced levels
of Mcl-1 and survivin (Fig. 2B), in accordance with previous reports
(3, 33). We have shown that PD98059-induced repression of
survivin expression occurs at the level of transcription (33).
Although p53 has also been reported to repress the survivin
promoter (34), the levels of survivin did not decrease further by the
addition of Nutlin-3a to PD98059 (Fig. 2B).
We have shown that Nutlin-3a induces transcription-independent apoptosis in OCI-AML-3 cells (8). The role of newly
synthesized proteins in the initiation of apoptosis was addressed
by the treatment of OCI-AML-3 cells with PD98059 and Nutlin-3a in
the absence or presence of 3.5 Amol/L cycloheximide. Inhibition of
protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not rescue OCI-AML-3
from Annexin V induction or Dw m loss by Nutlin-3a (Fig. 2C), as we
have reported previously (8). Interestingly, when Nutlin-3a was
combined with PD98059, cycloheximide partially protected cells

with Nutlin-3a alone increased from 28% to 43%. Our findings
suggest that PD98059 can enhance transcription-dependent
apoptotic signaling of the p53 pathway in these AML cell lines.
MEK inhibition accumulates p53 into the nucleus in OCIAML-3 cells. To investigate if PD98059 can mediate subcellular
localization of wild-type p53, we determined p53 localization in
OCI-AML-3 cells that were treated with PD98059 in the absence or
presence of Nutlin-3a using confocal microscopy. As previously
reported, a small amount of p53 was diffusely distributed in
untreated OCI-AML-3 cells, and after Nutlin-3a treatment, cells
exhibited increased p53 staining with inconspicuous accumulation
in the nucleus (8). After 24-h exposure to 20 Amol/L PD98059 alone,
the percentage of cells with preferential nuclear localization of p53
was significantly increased to 18.8 F 2.1% (untreated control: 7.1 F
0.6%; P < 0.01) although the incidence in the total cell population
was still low (Fig. 3A). Treatment with 20 Amol/L PD98059 itself
neither triggered significant apoptosis (Fig. 1A) nor increased p53
levels (Figs. 2A and 3B). Next, we investigated if PD98059 could
mediate p53 localization in cells simultaneously treated with
5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a. The percentage of cells with nuclear p53
accumulation in cotreated cells (71.7 F 4.2%) was significantly
higher than in cells treated with Nutlin-3a alone (39.1 F 2.6%; P <
0.01; Fig. 3C). Flow cytometric quantitation of intracellular p53
revealed a bimodal distribution in cells treated with Nutlin-3a alone
that converted into a unimodal high peak when cells were treated
with Nutlin-3a and PD98059 (Fig. 3D). The fluorescence intensity of
the merged peak was almost identical to that of the higher peak in
cells treated with Nutlin-3a alone. Because cells with nuclear p53
localization showed abundant p53, PD98059-mediated nuclear
accumulation of p53 seemed not only to support direct transcriptional activation of numerous p53 target genes but to protect p53
from degradation. The PI3K pathway is another signal transduction
pathway that is activated by Ras, and the Raf/MEK/ERK and the
PI3K pathways have been described to cooperate to promote
oncogenic transformation of mammalian cells (21, 35). To see if the
blockade of the PI3K pathway could mediate p53 localization or
cellular p53 levels, OCI-AML-3 cells were treated with the PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 (20 Amol/L) in the absence or presence of
5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a. LY294002 did not induce nuclear accumulation
of p53. Furthermore, LY294002 treatment of cells reduced basal p53
levels and inhibited p53 induction by Nutlin-3a ( figure not shown),
which was in clear contrast with the synergistic p53 induction by
PD98059 and Nutlin-3a. The inhibitory effect of LY294002 on p53
induction has recently been reported in cells treated with DNAdamaging agents (36). The nuclear relocation of p53 and its
increased levels in relation to PD98059 treatment were inconspicuous in MOLM-13 cells (data not shown), in which Nutlin-3a alone
causes intense nuclear accumulation of p53 (8).
Nuclear p53 accumulation by leptomycin B works in synergy
with Nutlin-3a to induce apoptosis in OCI-AML-3 cells. We
hypothesized that the ability of PD98059 to accumulate p53 into
the nucleus allowed it to synergistically act with Nutlin-3a in OCIAML-3 cells. To determine if nuclear accumulation of p53 is
sufficient to potentiate Nutlin-induced apoptosis, we used a potent
inhibitor of Crm1-mediated nuclear export, leptomycin B, to mimic
the nuclear p53 accumulation by PD98059. OCI-AML-3 cells were
incubated with a range of concentrations of Nutlin-3a for 24 h, in
the absence or presence of 0.5 ng/mL leptomycin B. Treatment
with leptomycin B alone caused nuclear accumulation of p53
(Fig. 4A), inducing modest apoptosis (6.5 F 0.4%; untreated
control: 3.0 F 0.2%; Fig. 4B). The addition of leptomycin B to

Nutlin-3a resulted in an impressive increase in the percentage of
Annexin V–positive cells compared with cells treated with Nutlin3a alone (41.8 F 1.2% versus 21.6 F 0.6% at 5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a;
Fig. 4B), suggesting that nuclear accumulation of p53 can enhance
Nutlin-induced apoptosis in OCI-AML-3 cells.
MEK inhibition does not affect the nucleoplasmic localization of Mdm2. Mdm2 is one of the key mediators of p53 nuclear
export (11), and we showed that PD98059 attenuates both basal
levels of Mdm2 and p53-dependent Mdm2 induction after Nutlin3a treatment. Because it has been described that the localization of
Mdm2 could affect p53 localization (37, 38), we determined the
Mdm2 localization in OCI-AML-3 cells treated with 20 Amol/L
PD98059 in the absence or presence of 5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a, using

confocal microscopy. Cells under unstressed conditions showed
nucleoplasmic distribution of Mdm2, which was not affected by
Nutlin-3a or PD98059 treatment ( figure not shown), arguing
against the idea that the MEK inhibition stabilizes p53 by blocking
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Mdm2 or by sequestering Mdm2 in
the nucleolus. Protein levels of Crm1 (39) or Tap (40), which could
mediate nuclear export of p53 in an Mdm2-independent manner,
were not affected by 24-h treatment of OCI-AML-3 cells with
100 Amol/L PD98059, as evidenced by Western blotting (Fig. 4C).
PD98059 restricts p21-mediated antiapoptotic mechanisms
by repressing p53-dependent induction of p21, which enables
Nutlin-3a to induce sufficient apoptosis in G1-phase cells. To
clarify if the apoptotic potential of Nutlin-3a is consistently

MEK Inhibition Enhances Nuclear Proapoptotic p53 Function

Figure 6. PD98059 inhibits p53-mediated induction of p21 by Nutlin-3a, and cells expressing p21 are resistant to Nutlin-induced apoptosis. A, OCI-AML-3 cells were
treated with 20 Amol/L PD98059 and 5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a for 8 h, either as individual agents or in combination, and p21 expression levels and DNA content were
measured by flow cytometry. To block caspase activation-mediated p21 cleavage, cells were preincubated for 1 h with 200 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK. Induction of p21
by Nutlin-3a was most prominent in G1 cells, which was antagonized by PD98059 treatment. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI ) ratio in G1 cells was calculated by
the formula: MFI ratio (G1-phase) = (MFI of G1 cells stained with anti-p21 antibody)/(MFI of isotypic control-stained G1 cells). B, OCI-AML-3 cells were treated with
20 Amol/L PD98059 and 5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a for 3 h, either as individual agents or in combination, and p21 transcripts were quantitated by real-time reverse
transcription-PCR. Each real-time PCR was done in triplicate, and the average fold induction relative to time 0 was shown with SD. C, OCI-AML-3 cells were treated
with 20 Amol/L PD98059 and 5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a for 24 h, either as individual agents or in combination, and annexin V–positive fractions in correlation with p21
expression levels were measured by flow cytometry. To block caspase activation-mediated p21 cleavage, cells were preincubated for 1 h with 200 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK.
Because of considerable induction of p21 at 24 h, data on p21 expression levels were plotted on logarithmic scale. Results show that cells with induced p21 were
mostly negative for annexin V.

enhanced by combination with PD98059 in different phases of cell
cycle, OCI-AML-3 cells were treated with 20 Amol/L PD98059 and
5 Amol/L Nutlin-3a, either as individual agents or in combination.
As shown in Fig. 5A, both PD98059 and Nutlin-3a caused profound
G1-phase cell cycle arrest in nonapoptotic cells (AnV ), which was
further enhanced by their combination. We and others have shown
that PD98059 and Nutlin-3a induce G1 arrest through p27 and p21
induction, respectively (3, 8, 21, 22, 41). In contrast to the modest
apoptosis in PD98059-treated cells, Nutlin-3a induced significant
apoptosis independent of cell cycle phases, with a relatively sparing
effect on G1 cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the synergistic apoptotic
effect between PD98059 and Nutlin-3a was preserved in G1-phase
cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest
does not efficiently protect cells from apoptosis in dually treated
cells. We have recently found that p53-dependent induction of p21
is preferentially seen in G1 cells (42). Because p21 has been
described to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis (23), we investigated
if the inhibitory effect of PD98059 on p53-mediated p21 induction
could contribute to the enhanced apoptosis induction in cells
treated with PD98059 and Nutlin-3a. As shown in Fig. 6A, 20 Amol/L
PD98059 strongly antagonized p21 induction by Nutlin-3a. Furthermore, cells with high p21 expression were resistant to apoptosis
induced by Nutlin-3a alone and by Nutlin-3a and PD98059 (Fig. 6B),
suggesting a protective role of p21 in p53-dependent apoptosis.

Taken together, the synergistic apoptotic effect between PD98059
and Nutlin-3a is, to some degree, attributable to the inhibitory effect
of PD98059 on p53-dependent p21 induction.

Discussion
Nutlins prevent p53 from binding to its negative regulator
Mdm2, leading to effective stabilization of p53 and activation of the
p53 pathway in vitro and in vivo (41). We have shown that Nutlins
effectively induce p53-dependent apoptosis in AML, in which TP53
mutations are rare and Mdm2 overexpression is a frequent event
(8). Because Mdm2 itself is the product of a p53-inducible gene,
however, the negative feedback loop may limit the duration or
amplitude of p53-mediated apoptosis in AML cells after Nutlin
treatment. In the majority of primary AML cases, the Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway is constitutively activated (3–5) and prognostic (43).
Because Raf/MEK/ERK signaling has been shown to up-regulate
Mdm2 expression (15, 16), we investigated if the blockade of this
pathway can potentiate Nutlin-induced p53-mediated apoptosis
and found that the MEK inhibitor PD98059 prevents p53dependent Mdm2 induction and synergizes with Mdm2 inhibitor
Nutlin-3a to induce apoptosis in AML cell lines. Importantly, MEK
inhibition promoted translocation of p53 from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus and enhanced transcription-dependent apoptosis in

Nutlin-treated OCI-AML-3 cells, in which p53 primarily induces
transcription-independent apoptosis when cells are treated with
Nutlin-3a alone (8). The regulation of p53 localization in
association with Raf/MEK/ERK signaling has not been investigated.
In support of the idea that interference with p53 localization
enhances p53 activation in Nutlin-treated cells, combining Nutlin3a with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B, which was by
itself only minimally apoptogenic, resulted in considerable
apoptosis in OCI-AML-3 cells. Because neither blockade of
Mdm2-p53 interaction nor MEK inhibition has been shown to
cause posttranslational modifications of p53 toward activation
(25, 44), our findings suggest that the two independent p53
responses, including an increase in p53 levels and nuclear
relocation of p53, could cooperate to activate p53 signaling. We
also suggest that the nuclear translocation of p53 could play a role
in p53 stabilization as well as transcriptional activation of p53
target genes, at least in some AML cells, because OCI-AML-3 cells
with the nuclear localization of p53 showed high levels of p53.
The regulation of p53 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is poorly
understood, but there have been several proteins that influence p53
nuclear import and export, one of the most important being Mdm2
(39). Mdm2 is involved in the nuclear export of p53, for which Mdm2
ubiquitin ligase activity is required (45). The function of Mdm2 has
been directly linked to the nuclear exclusion of p53 in a subset of
tumors such as neuroblastoma and breast cancer, in which
inhibition of Mdm2 expression by an antisense oligonucleotide or
inhibition of Mdm2 function by overexpressed p14ARF results in a
relocation of p53 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (46). The vital
role of Mdm2 in the regulation of p53 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is
further emphasized by the fact that most of the reported proteins
regulate p53 localization by interfering with Mdm2 (37, 38, 45–48). It
is therefore possible that the down-regulation of Mdm2 after
PD98059 treatment could contribute to the nuclear accumulation of
p53 and the enhancement of transcription-dependent apoptosis. On
the other hand, we have previously shown that the blockade of
Mdm2-p53 interaction by Nutlin-3a does not always result in the
accumulation of p53 in the nucleus and may induce its mitochondrial relocation in AML cells (8). Further investigations are needed to
clarify if the extent of Mdm2 inhibition could affect the subcellular

localization of p53 and if Raf/MEK/ERK signaling can regulate p53
localization in an Mdm2-independent manner.
The downstream events mediated by p53 take place by two
major pathways: cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. p53-dependent cell
cycle arrest is primarily mediated by the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p21. It is not clear how an individual cell chooses between
p21-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis after activation of
p53, but p53-inducible p21 has been reported to interfere with p53dependent apoptosis (23, 49–51). Direct mechanisms by which p21
inhibits apoptosis include inhibition of initiator caspase-8 cleavage
(49), interaction with procaspase-3 masking the serine proteinasecleaving site (50), and stabilization of the apoptotic inhibitor
protein c-IAP1 (51). In contrast, there have also been reports
suggesting a proapototic function of p21 under certain conditions
in specific systems (52). Using the highly specific inhibitors
PD98059 and Nutlin-3a, we found that MEK inhibition can block
p53-dependent p21 induction, which takes place most prominently
in G1 cells. Because high levels of p21 expression protected cells
from apoptosis induced by combination treatment with PD98059
and Nutlin-3a as well as by Nutlin-3a alone, the inhibitory effect of
PD98059 on p53-mediated p21 induction seemed to contribute to
the enhanced apoptosis induction in dually treated cells. Further
identification of factors that specifically repress p21 would provide
a better understanding of its role in cancer and may sensitize
cancer cells to current chemotherapeutic agents that activate p53
signaling (53).
