BACKGROUND. The association between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
a reduced lung cancer risk has been reported in previous studies. There is a high
female to male ratio in Chinese lung cancer patients, and female patients have
different clinicopathological characteristics compared with Western patient populations. The authors investigated whether HRT may reduce lung cancer risk in
Taiwan.

METHODS. The authors used a case-control study design to investigate 826
women with lung cancer and 531 healthy controls. Personal interviews based on
a structured questionnaire were performed to collect information on HRT use of
at least 3 months, age, ethnicity, active and passive smoking, exposure to air pollution, cooking or incense fumes, body mass index (BMI), menopause, and family
history of cancers.

RESULTS. HRT use was associated with reduced lung cancer risk with a multivari1

ate, adjusted odds ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53–0.94; P 5 .019). HRT use was associated with reduced odds ratio of lung cancer in all subset analyses stratified by
histology, active and passive cigarette smoking, BMI, history of incense burning,
cooking, and motorcycle riding, as well as family history of certain cancers.

CONCLUSIONS. This study confirmed that HRT is associated with a reduced lung
cancer risk. The results appeared to be applicable to Chinese female population
groups. Cancer 2007;110:1768–75.  2007 American Cancer Society.

ung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide
including Taiwan.1–2 Although tobacco smoking is a well-established etiologic factor for lung cancer,3 we found that most of the
female lung cancer patients in Taiwan were nonsmokers.4 Lung cancer in Chinese women has different clinicopathological features
compared with the Western population. The female to male ratio of
lung cancer patients was higher than the average ratio worldwide,4,5
and the cause remains unclear.

Hormone Replacement Therapy and Lung Cancer Risk/Chen et al.

Female smokers have higher relative risks for
lung cancer than male smokers.6–8 Sex hormones
may influence the metabolism of tobacco carcinogens by cytochrome p450 in the liver.8 Estrogen
receptors or estrogen binding sites are present in
nonsmall cell lung cancer tissues.9–11 Estrogen could
also potentially promote lung cancer.12 These findings suggest that sex hormones may play a role in
lung carcinogenesis.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used to
treat menopausal symptoms,13,14 but there is concern that HRT use may increase cancer risk. Prior
studies have shown that HRT use is associated with
an increased breast cancer risk.15,16 Conversely, HRT
may be associated with a protective role in colon
cancer carcinogenesis.17,18 The association of HRT
with lymphoma, ovary, liver, and other cancers
remains uncertain.19
The association between HRT use and lung cancer risk is inconsistent. In a Swedish populationbased cohort study, HRT use was associated with an
increased lung cancer risk,20 whereas a study in
Japan21 showed that induced menopause and HRT
use were associated with an elevated lung cancer risk
compared with normal menopausal women who did
not use HRT. A recent Canadian cohort study
demonstrated that long-term HRT use is associated
with increased risk of lung cancer.22 However, the
Women’s Health Initiative study17 and a hospitalbased case-control study23 found no association
between HRT use and lung cancer. A nested casecontrol study by Elliott and Hannaford found a nonsignificant reduction of lung cancer risk for HRT
users.24 Conversely, several studies have demonstrated an inverse association between HRT use and
lung cancer risk.25–27
Because of the high female to male ratio of lung
cancer patients in Taiwan and the frequent use of
HRT in women for postmenopausal symptoms, the
hypothesis that HRT may be associated with reduced
lung cancer risk is of clinical importance and needs
confirmation. In this study, we investigated whether
HRT was associated with a reduced lung cancer risk
in Chinese women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Subjects
We enrolled subjects who were participating in the
Genetic Epidemiological Study of Female Lung Adenocarcinoma (GEFLAC) in Taiwan, which is a molecular epidemiological study on susceptibility markers
for lung cancer in women. The study object of the

1769

GEFLAC is mainly focused on female lung adenocarcinoma, because adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of lung cancer in Chinese
women. However, for this study, GEFLAC included
patients of all histologies to investigate the genetic
epidemiology of lung cancer. Lung cancer patients,
aged 18 years or older, with histological or cytological
diagnoses were recruited from 6 tertiary medical centers in Taiwan, including National Taiwan University
Hospital, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, and Kaohsiung Medical University
Hospital. Those with metastatic lung cancer were
excluded. Subjects admitted to the health examination departments of these 6 hospitals were recruited
as controls. Those with a history of chronic bronchitis and emphysema were excluded. The institutional
review boards of all 6 hospitals approved this
research.

Data Collection
Informed consent was obtained from each study
subject. Personal interviews based on a structured
questionnaire were carried out to obtain information
on age, ethnicity, education level, history of active
and passive cigarette smoking, menopausal status
and age at menopause, number of miscarriages, family history of various malignancies, history of incense
burning, cooking, and motorcycle riding. The history
of HRT and contraceptive medication use was
recorded, including the age of initiation and the accumulative duration for medication use. If the subject was a current user, the accumulative duration
for medication use was calculated from the time
between the age of initiation and the age when the
subjects were included.
Lung cancer histology was classified according
to World Health Organization criteria.28 HRT use
was defined as when the subject had ever received
either estrogen replacement therapy or estrogen and
progestin combination therapy for an accumulative
duration of 3 months or more. Contraceptive use
was defined as a history of contraceptive medication for an accumulative duration of 3 months or
more.
The body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was derived
from the body height (m) and weight (kg). The body
weight of the healthy controls was obtained at enrollment. The body weight of the cases was recorded
according to the value while the case was in a
healthy state so as to avoid underestimating the BMI
because of cancer-related body weight loss.

‘‘Ever cigarette smokers’’ were defined as those
who had smoked cigarettes regularly for more than 6
months,25,29 including current and former smokers.
For the case group, ‘‘former smokers’’ were those
who had quit smoking for at least 6 months before
the diagnosis. In the control group, ‘‘former smokers’’
were those who had quit smoking for at least 6
months before the interview. ‘‘Pack-years’’ were
defined as the average number of cigarette packs
smoked per day multiplied by the number of years
smoked. The history of passive cigarette smoking
was defined as a history of inhaling other person’s
cigarette smoke at the workplace or a history of living with family members who smoked.
Exposure to air pollution was estimated by the
history of riding a motorcycle in traffic at least 3
days a week for more than 6 months. Incense fume
exposure was estimated by the history of burning
incense at least once a month. Exposure to cooking
fumes was defined as cooking for at least 6 months
continuously. A family history of breast, ovarian, cervical, or endometrial cancers in first-degree female
relatives was recorded.

Statistical Analysis
The SAS system for Windows version 8 (SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC,) and the Statistical Program for Social
Sciences program package, version 10.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, Ill) were used for statistical analysis. The
differences between the case and control groups
were analyzed by Pearson’s chi-square test. We
analyzed ethnicity, education, active and passive
smoking status, menopausal status, number of miscarriages, HRT use, contraceptive medication use,
family history of certain malignancies, histories of
exposure to cooking fumes, exposure to incense
fumes, and exposure to air pollution. The differences
in mean age, BMI, age at menopause, and cigarette
pack-years between the case and control groups
were examined by Student’s t test.
A multivariate logistic regression analysis was
performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) with its
95% confidence interval (CI) of developing lung cancer for each risk factor. The regression model
included known lung cancer risk factors (age, ethnicity, educational level, and active cigarette smoking),
hormone-related factors (BMI and menopausal status), potential environmental risk factors (cooking
fume exposure, passive cigarette smoking, burning
incense, motorcycle riding), as well as family history
of certain malignancies. All statistical tests were 2sided. A P-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics
A total of 1357 women were recruited from September 2002 to February 2006 from 6 hospitals; subjects
included 826 female lung cancer patients and 531
healthy controls (Table 1). Among the cases, there
were 22 (2.66%) patients with small cell lung carcinoma and 804 (97.34%) with nonsmall cell carcinoma, including 655 with adenocarcinoma (79.30%).
As shown in Table 1, there were differences
between the cases and controls in terms of age
(P 5 .001), ethnicity (P 5 .017), and educational level
(P < .001). Most cases and controls were never-smokers (92.86% vs 96.61%). Cases had a significantly
higher proportion than controls for ever-cigarette
smoking (7.14% vs 3.39%, P 5 .004) and passive cigarette smoking (69.49% vs 55.74%, P < .001). The
mean number of cigarettes smoked in pack-years
was similar among cigarette smoking cases and controls (mean  standard deviation: 292.0  199.3 vs
281.3  174.7; P 5 .842).
Differences between cases and controls were
also observed for the proportion of HRT use (17.55%
vs 25.24%, P < .001), history of incense burning
(65.74% vs 59.89%, P 5 .033), and menopause
(78.52% vs 72.88%, P 5 .018). There was no significant difference between cases and controls in age at
menopause, contraceptive medicine use, miscarriage,
BMI, history of exposure to cooking fumes, history of
motorcycle riding, and family history of breast, ovarian, cervical, or endometrial cancers.
From the multivariate analysis, we found that
those with HRT use (P 5 .019), those without passive
smoking (P < .001), and those with higher educational levels (P < .001) were significantly associated
with a reduced lung cancer risk. The statistical power
of this study was 92.4%.
HRT and Lung Cancer Risk
HRT use was significantly associated with a
decreased risk of lung cancer risk showing a multivariate, adjusted OR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53–0.94,
P 5 .019) as shown in Table 2. Stratification analyses
demonstrated the consistency of the association
between HRT and decreased risk of lung cancer
among different histological subtypes such as nonsmall cell carcinoma (OR 5 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53–0.95),
large cell carcinoma (OR 5 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21–0.87),
adenocarcinoma (OR 5 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56–1.03),
squamous cell carcinoma (OR 5 0.65; 95% CI, 0.29–
1.45), and small cell lung cancer (OR 5 0.51; 95% CI,
0.11–2.33). However, we may not draw conclusions
from these subgroup analyses with the very small
sample sizes in some of these subgroups.

HRT use may be associated with a reduced risk
of lung cancer in never smokers (OR 5 0.70; 95% CI,
0.52–0.94) and those without passive cigarette smoking (OR 5 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37–0.99) as shown in
Table 3. The P-for-trends for age analysis was .107.
HRT use may be associated with a reduced risk
of lung cancer in all subset analyses stratified by
BMI, history of incense burning, and history of cook-

ing fumes exposure as shown in Table 4. HRT use
may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer
in those with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (OR 5 0.66; 95% CI,
0.46–0.95), incense fume exposure (OR 5 0.66; 95%
CI, 0.46–0.96), or cooking fume exposure (OR 5 0.70;
95% CI, 0.51–0.94). The P-for-trend for BMI analysis
was .632.
HRT use may be associated with a reduced risk
of lung cancer in subset analyses stratified by history
of riding motorcycles (OR 5 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42–1.00),
those without a family history of breast, ovarian, cervical, or endometrial cancer (OR 5 0.69; 95% CI,
0.51–0.95) as shown in Table 5. Again, we may not
draw firm conclusions from the above subgroup
analyses especially with the very small sample sizes
in some of these subgroups.

DISCUSSION
We found that HRT use was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of lung cancer.
The consistency of the association between HRT use
and decreased lung cancer risk in subset analyses
further strengthens the hypothesis that HRT may
reduce the risk of lung cancer.

Several other studies have demonstrated an
inverse association between HRT and lung cancer
risk. In these studies, the inverse effect was found in
different durations of HRT use. Kreuzer et al. found
that more than 7 years of HRT use was associated
with a reduced lung cancer risk.25 Olsson et al.
demonstrated a reduced lung cancer risk in HRT ever
users; long-term HRT use (48 months) was associated
with a reduced risk of smoking-related cancers,
including lung cancer.26 Schabath et al.27 found HRT
use within the previous 6 months was associated
with a reduced lung cancer risk. In our study, we
defined HRT use as ever use of HRT for 3 months or
more, which is similar to the definition by Blackman
et al.23 The association of HRT and reduced lung
cancer risk could be found in studies with different
durations of HRT use. The relation between the duration of HRT use and lung cancer risk is unclear and
may required further study.

Some studies have shown an association between reproductive/hormonal factors and reduced
lung cancer risk in women. Kreuzer et al. found that
oral contraceptive use was associated with a reduced
lung cancer risk.25 Seow et al. reported a reduced
lung cancer risk for those who had 3 live births or
more.30 In a recent study, Kabat et al. found an
inverse association between age at first live birth and
lung cancer risk in parous women.22 Brenner et al.
found an association between an older age at menarche and a reduced risk of lung cancer in China.31
They also found a nonstatistically significant association (Ptrend 5 .074) between a later age at menopause
and reduced lung cancer.31 In our study, we found
no significant association between lung cancer risk
and hormonal/reproductive factors, such as menopausal status, number of miscarriages, contraceptive
medication use, and age at menopause.

tors.32,33 For women who received HRT, the exogenous hormones may bind to the estrogen receptors
instead of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
thereby limiting lung cancer carcinogenesis. However, this does not explain the protective effect of
HRT in a female population comprising > 90% nonsmokers in our study. The prevalence of ever smokers for women in Taiwan was 4.76%.34 We have also
found a low prevalence of ever smokers among
female lung cancer patients in our previous study.4
The cause for the very low prevalence rate of ever
smoking in female lung cancer patients remains
unclear.
From the multivariate analysis in this study, we
found that passive smoking was associated with an
increased lung cancer risk, which suggests that passive smoking may play a role in female lung carcinogenesis. The association of passive smoking and
increase lung cancer risk has been discussed in other
studies.35,36 HRT may have protective effects for subjects with and without passive smoking. Nonsmoking
factors may be involved in HRT and reduced lung
cancer risk.
HRT use may be associated with a reduced risk
of lung cancer for those with BMI < 25 kg/m2 in this
study. The explanation for this is unclear. Obesity
was associated with decreased lung cancer risk in 2
studies37,38 but with increased lung cancer risk in

1773

another study.39 Obese people tend to have higher
estrogen levels converted from androgens in fat tissue40,41 and higher unbound-estrogen levels with
lower levels of steroid hormone-binding globulin.41
Whether the circulating estrogen status of obese people was influenced by HRT remains unclear.
Exposure to combustion-related carcinogens
from incense burning or frying pan fumes while
cooking was associated with higher risks of lung cancer in nonsmoking Chinese women.42–44 However, a
more recent study in Hong Kong did not show such
correlations.45 No previous studies have investigated
the effects of HRT use concerning incense burning
and cooking. Our finding that HRT is associated with
reduced lung cancer risk in women with a history of
exposure to incense or cooking fumes suggests that
the interaction between estrogen and incense burning or cooking fumes in lung carcinogenesis may
need further investigation.
A familial aggregation of cancers of the reproductive system and the breast among female lung
cancer patients has been reported.46,47 An increased
risk of lung cancer in association with cancers of the
reproductive organs and breast48–54 was also
described. These findings suggest that there may be
some correlation in carcinogenesis among lung cancer and cancers of breast, cervix, endometrium, and
ovary. Subgroup analyses from this study suggest
that HRT may have a protective effect in patients
with a family history of these cancers (OR 5 0.58),
but the sample size is too small in this subgroup to
draw any conclusions.
Treatment of the A549 lung cancer cell line with
estrodiol resulted in down-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Treatment with
fulveststrant, an antiestrogen agent, increased the
EGFR expression in A549 cells.55 EGF treatment
reduced ERb expression, whereas gefitinib treatment,
an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, increased the
expression of ERb.55 Combining fulvestrant and gefitinib gave maximum antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in vitro.55 Hormone and EGFR interactions
may have important clinical implications for targeted
therapy of female Chinese lung cancer patients,
because they have a good response to EGFR targeted-therapy such as gefitinib.56–58
There are several limitations to this study. This
was a secondary analysis from a molecular epidemiological study on susceptibility markers of lung cancer in women. This type of study may also be
subjected to selection or recall bias. There was
incomplete information regarding the dose, duration,
or various estrogens used in HRT. This case-control
study is not case-matched. However, we adjusted for

1774

unmatched variables such as age, ethnicity, and education levels in our analysis. We may not draw firm
conclusions from our subgroup analyses, especially
with the very small sample sizes in some of these
subgroups.
In conclusion, HRT was associated with a
reduced lung cancer risk in Chinese women. Its multivariate, adjusted OR remained statistically significant in subset analyses stratified by other risk
factors. The consistency of these findings appeared
to support the hypothesis that HRT may reduce lung
cancer risk.
