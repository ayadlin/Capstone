Abstract
Resveratrol is a phytochemical with chemopreventive activity in preclinical rodent models of colorectal
carcinogenesis. Antiproliferation is one of the many chemopreventive modes of action it has been shown
to engage in. Concentrations of resveratrol, which can be achieved in human tissues after p.o. administration,
have not yet been defined. The purpose of this study was to measure concentrations of resveratrol and its
metabolites in the colorectal tissue of humans who ingested resveratrol. Twenty patients with histologically
confirmed colorectal cancer consumed eight daily doses of resveratrol at 0.5 or 1.0 g before surgical resection.
Resveratrol was found to be well tolerated. Normal and malignant biopsy tissue samples were obtained before
dosing. Parent compound plus its metabolites resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, resveratrol-4′-O-glucuronide,
resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, resveratrol-4′-O-sulfate, resveratrol sulfate glucuronide, and resveratrol disulfate were
identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV or mass spectrometric detection in
colorectal resection tissue. Quantitation was achieved by HPLC/UV. Cell proliferation, as reflected by Ki-67
staining, was compared in preintervention and postintervention tissue samples. Resveratrol and resveratrol3-O-glucuronide were recovered from tissues at maximal mean concentrations of 674 and 86.0 nmol/g,
respectively. Levels of resveratrol and its metabolites were consistently higher in tissues originating in the
right side of the colon compared with the left. Consumption of resveratrol reduced tumor cell proliferation
by 5% (P = 0.05). The results suggest that daily p.o. doses of resveratrol at 0.5 or 1.0 g produce levels in the
human gastrointestinal tract of an order of magnitude sufficient to elicit anticarcinogenic effects. Resveratrol
merits further clinical evaluation as a potential colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent. Cancer Res; 70(19);

Introduction
Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic phytochemical contained in grapes, peanuts, and mulberries, which has been shown to prevent malignancies in a
variety of target tissues in preclinical models, prominently
the colorectum (1). Resveratrol ameliorated formation of
aberrant crypt foci and/or adenocarcinoma incidence in
the colon of rats, which had been exposed to the carcinogens azoxymethane or N,N-dimethylhydrazine (2–4). It inAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Cancer Biomarkers and Prevention Group,

terfered with adenoma development in the ApcMin mouse,
a model of colorectal malignancies associated with an Apc
mutation (5, 6). Resveratrol also inhibited colorectal inflammation and carcinogenesis in a murine model of ulcerative
colitis (7). These promising preclinical results, together with
safety concerns associated with the use of nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs such as aspirin and selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors in colorectal cancer chemoprevention (8, 9), support consideration of resveratrol for
clinical development as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent. A recent pilot study of resveratrol at repeated
daily doses of up to 5 g for 29 days in healthy volunteers
showed that it is safe, although at the 2.5-g and 5-g dose
levels, it caused reversible diarrhea in some individuals.5 In
an earlier pharmacokinetic pilot study, consumption of a single dose of resveratrol at 5.0 g, the highest dose used, generated average peak plasma concentrations of 2.4 nmol/mL (10),
not dramatically below levels at which resveratrol elicits biochemical effects relevant to cancer chemoprevention in cells
in vitro (∼10 nmol/mL; ref. 1). Levels of metabolic resveratrol

Resveratrol in Colorectal Cancer Patients

conjugates exceeded those of parent agent by up to almost
6-fold, consistent with the poor systemic availability of resveratrol (10). The bioavailability of resveratrol administered
either as single agent (10–14) or as integral constituent of a
dietary mixture (11, 15–17) has been the focus of several recent clinical studies. However, it is not known whether consumption of resveratrol by humans can achieve target organ
concentrations commensurate with pharmacologic activity
observed in preclinical models. Such knowledge is essential
to optimize the design of future intervention studies aimed
at preventing malignancies.
Prominent among the many modes of action by which
resveratrol is considered to exert its chemopreventive efficacy is inhibition of proliferation of preneoplastic or malignant cells (18). In the light of the current interest in
resveratrol as a potential colorectal cancer preventive agent,
we wished to measure levels of resveratrol and its metabolites in the human colorectum to help define doses that
may be used in future colorectal cancer chemoprevention
intervention studies of this agent. In addition, we wanted
to determine plasma levels of resveratrol and/or its metabolites that accompany those measured in the colorectum.
To achieve these aims, patients with confirmed colorectal
cancer, who were to undergo surgical resection of their malignancy, received resveratrol at 0.5 or 1 g daily for 8 days
before surgery. Concentrations of parent agent and metabolites were determined in surgically removed tissue and
plasma. Finally, the hypothesis that the consumption of resveratrol at these doses may be associated with an antiproliferative effect in the target tissue was tested. To that end,
colorectal cell proliferation reflected by immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 was compared in tumor tissue
obtained by endoscopy before intervention and during surgical resection.

Materials and Methods
Patients
The study was approved by Nottingham UK Research
Ethics Committee. Twenty patients with resectable colorectal cancer were recruited into the study at the University
Hospitals of Leicester, United Kingdom. Patients met the following eligibility criteria: histological diagnosis of colorectal
adenocarcinoma, disease amenable to surgical resection; age,
>18 years; WHO performance status, 0 to 2; hemoglobin, >10
g/dL; alanine aminotransferase and serum bilirubin, <2.5×
and <1.5× the upper limit of normal, respectively; creatinine,
<140 μmol/L. The exclusion criteria included as follows: unfitness for general anesthesia, active peptic ulcer disease;
pregnancy or lactation; excessive alcohol intake, >21 and 14
units weekly for men and women, respectively; radiotherapy
or chemotherapy treatment within 28 days before enrollment, medication within 14 days of enrollment that could interfere with cell proliferation (anticoagulants including
warfarin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and steroids).
Patients were asked to abstain from consumption of foods
and drinks containing resveratrol during the study period
and gave written informed consent.

Intervention
Resveratrol was administered as uncoated, immediate release caplets containing 0.5 g of resveratrol, supplied by
Pharmascience, Inc. Patients (10 per dose level) received
resveratrol before surgical resection at either 0.5 or 1.0 g.
The choice of dose was based on the results of a recent phase I
repeat dose pharmacokinetic study of resveratrol daily doses
of 0.5 to 5.0 g in healthy volunteers, in whom the 0.5-g and
1.0-g doses ingested daily for 29 days was very well tolerated.6
Resveratrol was taken in the evening, between the hours of
17:00 to 22:00 each day for 8 days. The last dose was administered on the evening before surgical resection. Study participants were assessed for adverse events and graded in
accordance with the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0, 2006).
Sample preparation
Blood and colorectal tissues were collected predosing at
diagnostic endoscopy and postdosing at resection surgery.
At endoscopy, up to 12 biopsies were collected, six each of
malignant tissue and macroscopically normal tissue ∼5 to
10 cm away from the malignancy, in addition to those required for standard diagnostic purposes. The mean time periods between last dose and surgical resection or between last
dose and blood collection were 18 hours (range, 15–23 hours)
and 17.8 hours (range, 11–21 hours), respectively. Right-sided
tumors were resected by right hemicolectomy, and left-sided
tumors were resected by anterior resection or sigmoid colectomy. Resected bowel tissue was placed on ice and protected from light. One malignant tissue sample (including
mucosa) and, where possible, between 2 and 6 histologically
normal tissue samples were taken from each patient. Sample
weight was ∼0.5 to 1.0 g. Normal tissue was taken at a distance of ∼5 and/or ∼10 cm from the proximal and distal resection margins with a similar distance to the tumor; some
samples were also taken from the margins. For each patient,
half the number of samples were snap-frozen and kept at
−80°C until analysis, the other half were fixed in formalin
for 24 hours and embedded in paraffin wax.
Venous blood was collected in lithium heparin tubes predose and at the time of resection. Tubes were chilled on ice
and protected from light. Blood samples were kept on ice
and centrifuged (3,000 × g, 4°C, 15 minutes); the supernatant
was removed and frozen. Plasma and tissues were kept at
−80°C until analysis, which was performed within 6 months.
Analysis of resveratrol and resveratrol metabolites
Frozen tissue samples were mixed with liquid nitrogen
and ground and then weighed and homogenized with three
parts (w/v) of HEPES buffer. Samples of tissue homogenate
or plasma were extracted with methanol and analyzed by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/UV as
described previously (10, 19). Separation was achieved on
a Waters Atlantis C18 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 3 μm;

Waters) in combination with a Waters Atlantic C18 guard
column (4.6 mm × 20 mm, 3 μm). Quantitation of resveratrol using a gradient HPLC/UV system (Waters Alliance
2695) was performed using an internal standard (naringenin) and a method that had previously been validated in
terms of interday and intraday variability, recovery, accuracy, and precision. Tissue and plasma samples were extracted and analyzed in duplicate, and the mean value
was used. The extraction efficiency for resveratrol from tissue homogenate was 95.2 ± 2.8% (mean ± SD, n = 7). The
limit of quantitation was 175 pmol resveratrol/g tissue and
22 pmol/mL plasma, whereas the limit of detection was half
of these values. Resveratrol and its metabolites in biomatrices were stable under the storage and assay conditions.
As authentic resveratrol metabolites were not available in
sufficient quantities as reference materials, metabolite
amounts were calculated as “resveratrol equivalents,” on
the assumption that recovery characteristics and relationship
between peak area ratio and concentration were the same as
for parent resveratrol. Authentic resveratrol-3-O-sulfate (provided by Pharmascience), resveratrol-4′-O-sulfate, resveratrol3-O-glucuronide, and resveratrol-4′-O-glucuronide became
available during the course of the study by in-house synthesis,
permitting HPLC peak identification, so that resveratrol
metabolites could be identified by cochromatography. Metabolite identity was confirmed by liquid chromatography–
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with selected reaction
monitoring (SRM), operated in the negative ion mode using
a Waters Alliance 2695 series HPLC with a Waters Quattro
Ultima Pt triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters) under
chromatographic conditions described previously (10, 19).
Definitive isomer identification was not possible for resveratrol
disulfate and resveratrol sulfate glucuronide.
Analysis of cell proliferation
Colorectal tumor sections, obtained preintervention and at
the time of surgery, were stained for Ki-67 (mouse anti-human
monoclonal antibody, Dako). Briefly, paraffin-embedded
sections (4 μm) mounted on polysine-coated slides were dewaxed (65°C, 20 minutes) and hydrated through a graded
series of alcohol rinses. The antigen was unmasked by microwaving sections (20 minutes) in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9).
Endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated by incubation of slides with hydrogen peroxide (3%, 10 minutes); nonspecific binding was blocked with protein block solution.
Sections were incubated with primary antibody (dilution
1:2,000) overnight at 4°C. After washing (PBS) sections,
the tissue-antibody reaction was visualized using a commercial kit (Dako). Representative fields were selected in biopsies and superficial regions of the resected tumor of all
patients and in normal surgical specimens from five patients on the 0.5-g dose. The total number of epithelial cells
and the number of positively (brown) staining epithelial
cells were counted in six adjacent high-power fields (magnification, 400×; Leitz Orthoplan microscope, Leica DC 300
camera) for each sample by two independent observers.
Analyses were performed blinded. Differences in counts between observers were <10%, and both recorded the same

in samples stained for Ki-67 were as follows: 1,670 ± 625 in
preintervention and 1,592 ± 472 (mean ± SD, n = 21 sections) in postintervention malignant tissue and 1,343 ±

postintervention normal tissue. Values quoted under Results denote percentage of cells that stained positively.
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparison of results for Ki-67 immunostaining
of preintervention and postintervention tissues was made either by paired Student's t test or, in the case of the normal
tissue, by nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test because of the small sample size using Statistical Package for
Social Sciences version 13 (Windows XP). P values of 0.05
were considered to indicate significance.

nature, stage, and location of their tumors are described in
Table 1. One patient presented with two synchronous colorectal tumors in the sigmoid colon and cecum, which were
resected during the same surgical operation. Patients ingested resveratrol at 0.5 or 1.0 g daily for 8 days before surgery. There were no resveratrol-related adverse events, and
it was well tolerated at both doses.
Identification of resveratrol and its metabolites in
colorectal tissue
Resveratrol and its metabolites were recovered from human colorectal tissue and identified by HPLC/UV cochromatography with authentic reference material. Identity was
confirmed by suitable SRM mass transitions of mass-tocharge ratios (m/z) determined by HPLC/MS/MS analysis.
Figure 1A shows a representative HPLC/UV chromatogram
of colorectal tissue extracts from a patient who had ingested
eight doses of resveratrol, juxtaposed for comparison with a
chromatogram from another patient who had discontinued

intervention 7 days before bowel resection and was replaced
in the study (patient choice), and no longer had detectable
resveratrol species in his/her tissue. Resveratrol afforded a
substantial peak in the majority of samples. The following
species could be identified by cochromatography with authentic reference material and by mass spectrometry (Fig.
1B): resveratrol (m/z 227 > 184), resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide
and resveratrol-4′-O-glucuronide (m/z 403 > 227), resveratrol3-O-sulfate and resveratrol-4′-O-sulfate (m/z 307 > 227),
resveratrol disulfate (m/z 387 > 227), and resveratrol sulfate
glucuronide (m/z 483 > 227; Fig. 1B). The HPLC eluent containing the latter peak was collected, and the analyte was
identified by transitions of m/z 483 > 227 (loss of sulfate
and glucuronide), 483 > 403 (loss of sulfate), 483 > 307 (loss
of glucuronide), and 227 > 184 (characteristic transition for
resveratrol). Resveratrol sulfate glucuronide was a prominent
metabolite in colorectal tissue of 5 of the 10 patients on the
0.5-g dose and in 9 of the 10 patients on the 1.0-g dose. Overall, these findings contrast with results obtained previously

and glucuronic acid moieties in resveratrol disulfate (3) and resveratrol sulfate glucuronide (1) are probably 3 and 4′, but this needs confirmation by

resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and resveratrol-4′-O-glucuronide (m/z 403 > 227), and resveratrol-3-O-sulfate and resveratrol-4′-O-sulfate (307 > 227).
Resveratrol was also identified (m/z 227 > 184). The total ion current from the analysis of a mixture of authentic standards is also shown for comparison.
The mixture contained resveratrol-4′-O-glucuronide (1), resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide (2), dehydrated resveratrol glucuronide (exhibits the transition

in the plasma of healthy volunteers, in whom the amount of
resveratrol recovered was relatively small compared with
that of its metabolites, with resveratrol sulfate glucuronide
being only a minor metabolite (10).

bearing two colorectal tumors, in whom the concentrations
of resveratrol-derived species were considerably higher in the
cecal (right-sided) than the sigmoid colonic (left-sided) tumor
(Fig. 2).

Concentrations of resveratrol and its metabolites in
colorectal tissue
Parent agent and five metabolites were quantitated in
tumor and normal tissues from patients on resveratrol
(Tables 2 and 3). Individual values varied substantially from
each other, reflected by coefficients of variation in some
cases exceeding 200%, both between specific tissue sites
for each individual and for each site between patients. In
most tissues, concentrations of resveratrol and its metabolic
conjugates were higher in samples of right-sided origin
(cecum, ascending colon, and hepatic flexure/transverse
colon) than in those from the left side (splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum; Tables 2 and 3).
Highest mean concentrations of parent resveratrol after the
0.5-g and 1.0-g doses were 18.6 and 674 nmol/g (or nmol/mL,
assuming 1 mL weighs 1 g), respectively, in normal tissue localized proximal to the tumor on the right side and 8.33 and
94.1 nmol/g, respectively, in right-sided tumors. Maximal mean
tissue concentrations determined for resveratrol metabolites
(in nmol resveratrol equivalents/g) were 86.0 for resveratrol3-O-glucuronide at the 0.5-g dose level and 67.2 for resveratrol3-O-sulfate in patients on 1.0-g resveratrol, both observed in
normal right-sided colorectal tissue proximal to the tumor
(Tables 2 and 3, respectively). The difference in levels between
left- and right-sided tumors is best illustrated in a patient

Concentrations of resveratrol and its metabolites
in plasma
Plasma was obtained from these patients at the point of
surgery and analyzed for resveratrol-derived species. Resveratrol was present at levels close to or below the limit of
detection. Five resveratrol conjugates circulated at quantifiable concentrations, and these were identified by mass
spectrometry as the two monoglucuronides, resveratrol3-O-sulfate, resveratrol sulfate glucuronide, and resveratrol
disulfate (Table 4). The highest mean level (22.3 nmol/mL)
was observed for resveratrol sulfate glucuronide in patients
on 1.0-g resveratrol.
Effect of resveratrol on colorectal cell proliferation
Ki-67 is a granular component of the nucleolus expressed
exclusively in proliferating cells and commonly used as a
surrogate marker of cell growth. Levels of Ki-67 were measured immunohistochemically in epithelial cells of biopsy
and resection tissues. In all patients collectively, tumor cell
Ki-67 staining was reduced from 88.0 ± 6.64% in predose
biopsy samples to 83.2 ± 10.0% in postintervention surgical
tissue (n = 20; P = 0.05, paired Student's t test). When
the 0.5-g and 1.0-g dose groups were analyzed separately,
resveratrol consumption still decreased tumor cell Ki-67
staining by 5.6% and 1.9%, respectively, albeit this reduction

normal tissue of five patients on the 0.5-g dose, and staining was reduced from 74.6% ± 20.6% in biopsies to 67.6% ±
15.4% in surgical tissues (P = 0.05, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney

after intervention (resection tissue) did not show any histopathologic differences.

Discussion

Figure 2. Concentrations of resveratrol and resveratrol-3-O-sulfate in
normal colon and tumor tissue of a patient with a cecal (right-sided) and a
sigmoid colonic (left-sided) tumor, who had received resveratrol at a
dose of 1.0 g daily for 8 d. Normal tissue samples were taken at a
distance of 5 cm proximal or distal from tumor and from the distal
resection margin (RM). Differences in levels between the left and right
side, similar to those shown here, were observed for resveratrol disulfate
and the two resveratrol monoglucuronides, but not for resveratrol
sulfate glucuronide.

The results outlined above define for the first-time concentrations of resveratrol and its metabolites in the colorectum of individuals who ingested resveratrol repeatedly.
The highest mean resveratrol tissue concentrations observed (18.6 and 674 nmol/g for the 0.5-g and 1.0-g dose
levels, respectively) are close to or exceed 36 nmol/g, the
mean concentration of resveratrol measured in the gastrointestinal tract of ApcMin mice on resveratrol at 0.2% in the
diet (6). This gastrointestinal tissue level of resveratrol accompanied reduction of ApcMin adenoma number by 27%
compared with mice on control diet. Parent resveratrol accounted for a much larger proportion of total resveratrol
species in colorectal tissue than in the plasma at an equivalent time point postdosing, which supports the notion that
the colorectum may be a suitable target for chemoprevention by oral resveratrol. The colorectal tissue concentrations
described here for resveratrol are above those achieved
after repeated consumption of curcumin at 3.6 g, another
putatively chemopreventive polyphenol, which were 7.7 and
12.7 nmol/g in tumor and normal tissue, respectively (20). In
human-derived colon cells in vitro, resveratrol has been
shown to elicit biochemical effects commensurate with anticarcinogenesis, such as growth inhibition and apoptosis induction, at concentrations exceeding ∼10 nmol/mL (21–23).

For example, the mean IC 50 values for the resveratrolmediated inhibition of growth of human-derived HT-29 or
HCA-7 colon cancer cells were 19.9 and 26.2 nmol/mL,
respectively (23). Although the concentrations measured
here in the colorectum of patients were highly variable,
they suggest that the doses administered (0.5 and 1.0 g)
can give colorectal tissue levels associated with chemopreventive activity. It is important to note that these doses
are similar to or considerably above those that have been
shown to prevent colorectal malignancies in preclinical
models. Daily doses of resveratrol in rodents that, when
administered for an extended period of time, exerted
chemopreventive activity and their corresponding counterparts in a 70-kg human (obtained by body surface area
extrapolation; ref. 24) were as follows: 15 or 240 mg/kg in
the ApcMin mouse (5, 6) equating to 81 mg and 1.3 g in
humans; 0.2 mg/kg in rats exposed to azoxymethane (2)
equating to 1.9 mg in humans; 8 mg/kg in rats that received
N,N-dimethylhydrazine (3) equating to 75 mg in humans;
the human equivalent doses that reduced azoxymethaneinduced colon cancer in a mouse model of colitis were
116 and 232 mg (7).
We recovered resveratrol conjugates at quantifiable
concentrations from the colorectum, with resveratrol-3-Oglucuronide furnishing the highest value at 86 nmol resveratrol equivalents/g. This finding is important as it has been
speculated that resveratrol conjugates may contribute to
the pharmacologic efficacy of its parent (1), a theory which
still requires experimental verification. Concentrations of
resveratrol and its metabolites varied depending on the anatomic site from where the tissue originated, with generally
higher values in the right-sided than left-sided colorectum.
Feces are transported from the cecum on the right side
across the transverse to the sigmoid colon and rectum on
the left, and resveratrol tissue concentrations are likely to
be related to those in the feces. So it is conceivable that
concentrations are higher in right-sided tissues as they
come into contact with fecal resveratrol earlier than those
on the left side. Furthermore, the feces are liquid in the

7398

Cancer Res; 70(19) October 1, 2010

right-sided colorectum, becoming more solid as they pass
onto the left, and the fluid environment of the right colon
is probably better suited to the permeation and absorption
of small molecular weight species such as resveratrol than
the semisolid environment on the left (25). Whereas plasma levels of parent resveratrol that accompanied tissue levels were at or below the limit of quantitation, resveratrol
monoglucuronides, resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, resveratrol disulfate, and resveratrol sulfate glucuronide circulated at quantifiable levels, consistent with the low systemic availability
of resveratrol and its avid conjugative metabolism (1).
The implication of this finding is that the presence of
resveratrol conjugates in the circulation may be exploited
as markers of adherence in future intervention trials of
resveratrol.
There was an indication that resveratrol exerted a small
reduction in cell proliferation in colorectal tissue after ingestion. Although the biological importance of such a slight
decrease is debatable, its observation suggests that, in
principle, resveratrol can exert a pharmacologic effect in
the human colorectum. It needs to be stressed that pharmacodynamic data based on the comparison of phenomena
in biopsies with those in resection tissue have to be interpreted with utmost caution because of differences in localization, method of surgical procurement, and size of
samples. Nevertheless, compromising cell proliferation is
one of the modes of action by which resveratrol is thought
to exert its chemopreventive efficacy, and the slight reduction in cell proliferation observed here is consistent with
the effect of resveratrol on colorectal cells in vitro (21–23)
and colorectal tissue in rats in vivo (3).
In conclusion, the results described here suggest that
daily doses of resveratrol at 0.5 and 1.0 g can furnish levels
in the human gastrointestinal tract that are of an order
of magnitude sufficient to elicit pharmacologic effects.
Therefore, resveratrol merits further clinical evaluation as
a potential alternative to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
agents and selective COX inhibitors in colorectal cancer
chemoprevention.
