Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy for
Head and Neck Cancer
Is There a Verdict?
With interest we read the editorial of Robbins et al,1
which questioned the conclusion of a prospective
randomized trial2 in which intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin
chemoradiation was not found to be superior to the current standard of intravenous cisplatin chemoradiation.
Bilateral IA infusion was stricter than prescribed in
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 9615
(RTOG-9615). If the tumor exceeded >1 cm over the anatomical midline, double-sided infusion according to the
flow ratio between the 2 feeding arteries was recommended. The lower rate of double-sided infusions in earlier phase 2 investigations by Robbins et al may therefore
be attributed to a different patient selection. The difference in mean tumor volume of 18 mL versus 30 mL
between the 2 series is indicative in that respect.
Second, we performed an unplanned subset analysis
and scored for all patients the eligibility of unilateral infusion and tumor volume. Local control was found to be significantly better in the IA versus the intravenous arm
among patients whose tumor did not extend across the
midline (hazard ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.05-0.60 [P ¼ .0025]), whereas it was nonsignificantly worse in the other patients (HR, 1.43; 95%
CI, 0.66-3.09). The benefit from IA treatment was limited to 14 of the 26 patients with a large (>30 mL) tumor
not extending across the midline (HR, 0.14; 95% CI,
0.03-0.72), whereas no significant benefit was observed in
the remaining 3 groups.
Another concern of Robbins et al is the potential
influence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
They speculate that benefit from IA versus intravenous
treatment may be limited to the small subgroup of HPVnegative patients. In this case, even an analysis accounting
for HPV status would likely not have been able to detect
an overall difference. Unfortunately, HPV status was not
determined within the trial, but because assays are currently being performed, we will eventually be able to evaluate whether HPV status is predictive of benefit from IA
treatment.
Therefore, we conclude that the jury has come to a
conclusion: for patients with advanced, inoperable head

and neck cancer, IA is not superior to intravenous
chemoradiation.

Is There a Verdict?
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the letter
by Rasch et al. We are pleased they have provided additional data from a subset analysis, which sheds light on the
true value of intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin chemoradiation.
The subset analysis included all patients who were eligible
for unilateral infusion based on the more stringent Dutch
criteria, and whose primary tumor volume exceeded a
total of 30 mL. It is striking to observe that local control
was significantly better in the IA group compared with the
intravenous group among this cohort of patients (hazard

ratio [HR], 0.17; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
0.05-0.60 [P ¼ .0025]). Although this benefit from IA
treatment was limited to the 14 of 26 patients with a large
(>30 mL) tumor not extending across the midline (HR,
0.14; 95% CI, 0.03-0.72), no significant benefit was
observed in the remaining 3 groups. This led Rasch et al
to conclude that there is no overall difference between IA
versus intravenous cisplatin chemoradiation. However,
had most of the 30 patients with high-volume disease who
were receiving bilateral IA infusions been treated with a
unilateral approach using the less stringent North American criteria, it is our opinion that the rate of local disease
control would likely have been improved. In addition,
there were 29 patients in the low-volume group who
received bilateral infusions and again, some of them may
have benefited from a unilateral IA infusion. As we previously pointed out in the editorial1 accompanying their article,2 bilateral IA infusions are required in <5% of
patients and clearly are suboptimal for local disease control. Given that 56% of patients in the IA arm received a
bilateral infusion, we believe that the negative effect of the
suboptimal infusions may be very real in this trial.
Although patients with low tumor volume and positivity
for the human papillomavirus have a better prognosis,
randomized trials are still required to determine whether

less intensive chemoradiation protocols are feasible for
such subsets. On the contrary, if there is no apparent difference in overall toxicity between the 2 regimens, as
shown in the Dutch trial, we believe that the more intensive IA cisplatin chemoradiation protocol is an option
that many patients would chose.
