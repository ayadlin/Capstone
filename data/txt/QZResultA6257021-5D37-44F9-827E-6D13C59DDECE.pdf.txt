Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor that tends to be resistant to the
ionizing radiotherapy used to treat it. Because TGF-b is a modiﬁer of radiation responses, we conducted a
preclinical study of the antitumor effects of the TGF-b receptor (TGFbR) I kinase inhibitor LY2109761 in
combination with radiotherapy. LY2109761 reduced clonogenicity and increased radiosensitivity in GBM cell
lines and cancer stem–like cells, augmenting the tumor growth delay produced by fractionated radiotherapy in a
supra-additive manner in vivo. In an orthotopic intracranial model, LY2109761 signiﬁcantly reduced tumor
growth, prolonged survival, and extended the prolongation of survival induced by radiation treatment. Histologic
analyses showed that LY2109761 inhibited tumor invasion promoted by radiation, reduced tumor microvessel
density, and attenuated mesenchymal transition. Microarray-based gene expression analysis revealed signaling
effects of the combinatorial treatments that supported an interpretation of their basis. Together, these results
show that a selective inhibitor of the TGFbR-I kinase can potentiate radiation responses in glioblastoma by
coordinately increasing apoptosis and cancer stem–like cells targeting while blocking DNA damage repair,
invasion, mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. Our ﬁndings offer a sound rationale for positioning TGFbR
kinase inhibitors as radiosensitizers to improve the treatment of glioblastoma. Cancer Res; 71(23); 7155–67. 2011

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) continues to be the most
frequent and most malignant human brain tumor, which is
highly resistant to current conventional treatments and has
one of the worst survival rates among all human cancers.
New strategies to treat this deadly disease are desperately
needed. Emerging evidence suggests that many cancers,
including hematopoietic and solid tumors, may be driven
by a small subpopulation of cancer stem–like cells [CSLC; or

cancer stem cells (CSC); or tumor-initiating cells (TIC)].
GBMs are among the ﬁrst solid cancers in which CSLCs
were identiﬁed (1, 2). CSLCs markers such as CD133 and side
population have been used to prospectively isolate a small
fraction of cells in human brain tumors with increased
potential to generate tumor neurospheres and xenografts
(3, 4). Recent reports suggest that the expression of the
CD133 antigen in gliomas and other brain tumors could
serve as a prognostic indicator for tumor recurrence, malignant progression, treatment resistance, and patient survival
(5). Several studies indicate that conventional radiation
therapies appear to predominantly target the better differentiated CD133 population while leaving many CD133þ
CSLCs alive (6). Thus, targeting CSLCs using inhibitors of
TGF-b could be a promising attempt to improve glioblastoma treatment (7).
TGF-b is a family of polypeptides that regulates a wide
variety of biologic functions including cell proliferation,
migration, survival, angiogenesis, immunosurveillance, and
embryonic stem cell maintenance and differentiation. The
multifunctional effects of TGF-b are elicited through dimerization of the type I (TGFbR-I) and type II (TGFbR-II) serine/
threonine kinase receptors. Upon TGF-b binding, the receptor complex phosphorylates the transcription factors
SMAD2 and SMAD3, which then binds to SMAD4 and
translocates to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription of various target genes (8). The overexpression of TGF-b

ligands has been reported in various malignant entities
including malignant gliomas (9–11). In patients with malignant glioma, elevated levels of TGF-b have been reported to
be associated with high tumor grade, advanced tumor
stages, and poor patient outcome (9, 12). In addition to be
implicated in invasion and intratumoral angiogenesis in
glioblastoma, TGF-b signaling has also been reported to
play a pivotal role in maintenance of stemness of glioma
CSLCs (13, 14). These multiple roles of TGF-b in glioma
initiation and progression have promoted the development
of therapeutic agents based on the inhibition of the TGF-b
pathway (13, 15). LY2109761, a novel TGFbR-I kinase inhibitor, has shown a SMAD2-selective inhibitory proﬁle with
antitumor activity in various tumor models such as colorectal cancer (16), pancreatic cancer (17), and hepatocellular
carcinoma (18).
Because radiotherapy is a mainstay treatment modality
in glioblastoma but may promote radioresistance in glioma
stem cells (6), a combination with an inhibitor of TGF-b,
which targets in particular CSLCs (7), seems promising. We
investigated here the combination effects of radiation and
LY2109761 in established human glioblastoma cell lines and
in GBM CSLCs in vitro and in vivo in a subcutaneous and an
orthotopic tumor model. Our data indicate that LY2109761
is an effective treatment approach alone and augments
the radiation treatment response in particular in GBM
CSLCs.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and treatment conditions
The human GBM cell lines U87MG and T98 were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. CD133þ glioblastoma CSLCs (NMA-23) were maintained in their undifferentiated state using neurobasal media supplemented with
epidermal growth factor and ﬁbroblastic growth factor,
sodium pyruvate, glutamine, B27, nonessential amino acids,
and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). NMA-23 cells were
isolated from human glioblastoma surgical sample using
ﬂuorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) method with a
phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled CD133 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) as previously described (19). The collection of human
biopsy tissue was approved by the regional ethical committee. LY2109761 was kindly provided by Eli Lilly, constituted
in dimethyl sulfoxide (10 mmol/L), and stored at 20 C. Cell
exposures with LY2109761 were conducted 2 hours prior to
irradiation with 6 MV X-rays (Mevatron, Siemens) at a dose
rate of 2.5 Gy/min.
Short interfering RNA treatment
Validated Stealth RNAi (Invitrogen) speciﬁc to TGFbR-I was
transfected into U87MG and NMA-23 by using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stealth RNAi negative control with low GC content
(Invitrogen) was used as negative control. The expression of
TGbFR1 was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR), and phosphorylation of SMAD2 was examined using
Western blot analysis.

Clonogenic assay
Increasing numbers of cells [pretreated with LY2109761
for 2 hours or transfected with short interfering RNA (siRNA)
targeting TGFbR-I or nonsense siRNA for 48 hours] were
plated in 25 cm2 ﬂasks, irradiated, and returned to the
incubator for 10 to 14 days. Colonies formed were stained
with crystal violet (Sigma) and those with at least 50 cells
were counted by microscopic inspection. The linear quadratic equation was ﬁtted to data sets to generate survival
curves, and dose enhancement factor for drugs was calculated at 10% surviving fraction (DEF0.1).
Neurosphere formation, limiting dilution, and
proliferation assay
For the neurosphere formation assay, 1,000 NMA-23 cells
(pretreated with LY2109761 for 2 hours or transfected with
siRNA targeting TGbFR-I or nonsense siRNA for 48 hours) were
seeded on 25 cm2 ﬂasks and irradiated. After 7 days of
incubation, numbers of neurospheres consisting of at least
50 cells were counted under a microscope. For the limiting
dilution assay, increasing numbers of NMA-23 cells were plated
in 96-well plates in 200 mL serum-free medium and treated with
radiation or LY2109761 or their combination. After 7 days of
culture, the percentage of wells not containing neurospheres
for each cell-plating density was calculated and plotted against
the number of cells plated per well. For the proliferation assay,
50,000 NMA-23 cells were seeded on 25 cm2 ﬂasks overnight
and then treated as described, incubated for another 72 hours,
when the numbers of living cells were counted.
Immunoﬂuorescent staining for gH2AX
Cells were grown and treated in chamber slides. At speciﬁed
time points, cells were ﬁxed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10
minutes and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30
minutes on ice. Antibody [AlexaFluor 488 anti-H2AX phosphorylated (Ser139); Biolegend] was added at a dilution of
1:100 in 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated overnight at
4 C. Cells were washed and nuclei were counterstained with 1
mg/mL 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Foci were counted by
the automated image analysis system Metacyte with a Zeiss
Axioplan-2 imaging epiﬂuorescence microscope equipped
with ISIS software (MetaSystems). For each treatment condition, gH2AX foci were analyzed in at least 400 cells and median
number of foci was determined.
Apoptosis and ﬂow cytometry
Twenty-four hours after treatments, U87MG and NMA-23
cells were prepared for FACS analysis (FACScan; Becton Dickinson). Cells were ﬁxed in 70% ethanol, centrifuged, washed in
PBS, and the supernatant was removed. Cells were resuspended in the staining solution of PBS, RNase (200 mg/mL),
and propidium iodide (10 mg/mL) and were analyzed for cells
with sub-G1 DNA content. To measure caspase-3 activity, cells
were treated according to the manufacturer's suggestions (BD
Pharmingen), incubated for 20 minutes on ice, pelleted,
washed, and resuspended in washing buffer plus PE-conjugated monoclonal active caspase-3 (BD Pharmingen) and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).

LY2109761 and Radiation in an Orthotopic Glioblastoma Model

Western blot analysis
Six hours after treatment as indicated, cells were washed
twice with PBS, and lysed using Qproteome Mammalian
Protein Prep Kit (QIAGEN GmbH) supplemented with a complete protease and phosphate inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Protein concentration was measured using a Bradford assay
(Pierce Chemical Co.), and samples were immunoblotted with
antibodies against phospho (p)-SMAD2 and total SMAD2 (Cell
Signaling) with an anti-b-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma)
as internal loading control.
Microarray analysis
U87MG cells were solubilized and homogenized in TRIzol
(Invitrogen) 6 hours after radiation with or without LY2109761
treatment (4 Gy, 10 mmol/L). For LY2109761 treatment, cells
were exposed to LY2109761 for 2 hours prior to irradiation as in
the other in vitro assays. Total RNA was isolated according to
the manufacturer's instruction, purity and integrity of the RNA
were assessed with Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies), and 200 ng of total RNA was used for ampliﬁcation
and labeling using the Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit
(#5190-0442) from Agilent following the detailed kit protocol.
Cyanine 3–labeled cRNA was puriﬁed using RNeasy mini spin
columns from QIAGEN. Quantity and cyanine incorporation of
labeled cRNAs were determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000
spectrophotometer (Peqlab Biotechnologies GmbH). The
labeled probes were then hybridized to an Agilent 4  44 K
whole human genome microarray (G4112F) containing 45,015
features representing 41,000 unique probes. After washing,
microarrays were scanned using an Agilent Array scanner
(Agilent Technologies). Data were extracted with Agilent feature extraction software (Agilent version 9.1) and statistically
analyzed with SUMO software as previously described (20).
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for functional analysis
(IPA; Ingenuity Systems, Inc.; ref. 21). Microarray data were
deposited in "ArrayExpress" (Accession No.: E-TABM-1148).
qRT-PCR
To quantify mRNA expression, qRT-PCR was carried out
using QuantiTect Primer assay (QIAGEN GmbH) and QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (#204243; QIAGEN) on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics). The relative expression of the target genes was calculated by normalizing the Cp
(crossing point) values with those of housekeeping gene GAPDH.
Tumor growth in the subcutaneous U87MG model in
BALB/c mice
All animal experiments were approved by in-house and
governmental animal protection committees. A total of 5 
106 U87MG cells were injected subcutaneously into the right
hind limb of 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c athymic nude mice
(Charles River Laboratories). Animals were randomized into
4 groups (control, LY2109761, radiation, radiation plus
LY2109761; n ¼ 10 each). Treatments started when tumors
were established and reached a volume of approximately 150
mm3. Tumors were irradiated with fractionated radiotherapy
(5  2 Gy, days 0–4 for 5 consecutive days) using a 6 MV LINAC
(Siemens). LY2109761 was administered orally at 50 mg/kg

www.aacrjournals.org

twice daily (days 1–5 of each week) until the end of observation.
Tumor volume for the subcutaneous experiment was determined 3 times weekly by direct measurement with calipers
(volume ¼ length  width  width  0.5).
Tumor growth and animal survival in the orthotopic
CSLC model in SCID mice
Beige severe-combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice (8week-old, 20 g; Charles River Laboratories) were anesthetized
and stereotactically inoculated with NMA-23 cells (104 cells in
2 mL PBS) into the left forebrain (2 mm lateral, 1 mm anterior to
bregma, at 3 mm depth from skull surface). Animals were
randomized into 4 treatment groups (control, LY2109761,
radiation, radiation plus LY2109761; n ¼ 13 each, with 4 mice
scheduled for histology). LY2109761 treatment (50 mg/kg twice
daily) started on day 1 after tumor inoculation and was administered 5 days weekly until the end of observation. Radiation
was delivered on day 4 to the entire head of anesthetized mice
(7 Gy single dose) using the 6 MV LINAC. On day 15, animals
were examined by MRI at 1.5 T (Siemens Magnetom Vision)
using a custom-made small animal solenoid Tx/Rx radiofrequency coil. Tumor volumes were estimated using gadoliniumenhanced T1-weighted spin-echo images. A 3-dimensional
reconstruction of the tumor surface and calculation of the
tumor volume were conducted with the QuickVol software as
previously described (22). For survival studies, moribund mice
or mice with severe neurologic symptoms were euthanized.
Tumor histology and immunohistochemistry
Four animals per group were sacriﬁced on day 16 and
exsanguinated by transcardial perfusion ﬁrst with ice-cold
PBS. Brains were dissected, partially cryoﬁxated, or embedded in parafﬁn after ﬁxation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24
hours. Sections of parafﬁn-embedded blocks were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry was
carried out with frozen sections as previously described
(23). Primary antibodies included the following: anti-vimentin (rabbit polyclonal; Abcam; 1:200), anti-CD31 (rabbit
polyclonal; BD Biosciences Pharmingen; 1:100), anti-ﬁbronectin (rabbit polyclonal; Abcam; 1:400), anti-COL5A1 (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz; 1:100), and anti-YKL-40 (rabbit
polyclonal; Quidel; 1:200). After incubation with primary
antibodies, the appropriate ﬂuorescence-labeled secondary
antibodies were applied. Images were captured using a
Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a Nikon
digital sight DS-U1 camera and subsequently analyzed using
ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). For each treatment
condition, the analysis was conducted in at least 5 randomly
chosen ﬁelds from 3 to 5 sections.
Statistical analysis
The unpaired 2-tailed t test was used for the comparison of
parameters between groups. The Kaplan–Meier method was
used to determine the median survival time (MST), and a logrank test was used to compare the differences between survival
curves. A value of P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. The
statistical analysis was conducted using the software package
Statistika 6.0 (Statsoft).

LY2109761 reduced GBM-derived CSLC self-renewal and
proliferation and sensitizes them to radiation
Considering that glioblastoma stem cells have been
linked to radioresistance, we explored whether LY2109761
would inhibit the self-renewal of GBM CSLCs and increase
the sensitivity of these TICs toward radiation. We used
neurosphere formation as a surrogate marker of the clonogenic survival of glioblastoma CSLCs given they grow in
suspension (24). We found that LY2109761 (10 mmol/L) or
radiation (4 Gy) alone reduced neurosphere-forming efﬁciency in NMA-23 cells. The combination of LY2109761 plus
radiation had supra-additive effects in neurosphere formation and limiting dilution assays (Fig. 2A, B, and D).
Likewise, blockage of TGF-b signaling via TGbFR-I siRNA
alone or combined with radiation also reduced clonogenicity of NMA-23 cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, a proliferation
assay revealed a reduction of NMA-23 cells proliferation/
viability after LY2109761 or radiation treatment alone, and
their combination resulted in a further reduction of the cell
count (Fig. 2E).

LY2109761 enhanced radiosensitivity of glioblastoma
cells
To determine the effects of LY2109761 on GBM tumor cell
radiosensitivity, clonogenic survival analysis was conducted.
LY2109761 pretreatment reduced clonogenic survival in cell
cultures of U87MG (Fig. 1A) and T98 (Fig. 1B) following
radiation, resulting in an increase in the radiosensitivity with
a DEF0.1 of 1.30 and 1.37, respectively. Likewise, TGbFR-I
siRNA reduced TGbFR-I mRNA expression and inhibited
SMAD2 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1), associated
with an increase in the radiosensitivity with a DEF0.1 of 1.34
in U87MG cells (Fig. 1C), supporting the notion that
LY2109761 exhibits its radiosensitizing effect via TGF-b
signaling blockage.

LY2109761 enhanced radiation-induced DNA damage
and apoptosis rates in glioblastoma cells and GBMderived CSLCs
DNA damage and repair are important components
of radiation-induced cytotoxicity. As a marker of recognized
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), we evaluated the induction of nuclear foci of phosphorylated histone H2AX
(gH2AX). U87MG and NMA-23 cells were pretreated with
LY2109761 (10 mmol/L) for 2 hours and irradiated (2 Gy). In
both cells, LY2109761 signiﬁcantly increased the number of
radiation-induced gH2AX foci at 30 minutes and 24 hours
postirradiation (Fig. 3A–C), whereas LY2109761 monotherapy did not signiﬁcantly alter (P > 0.5) the number of

data sets. A, U87MG treated with or without LY2109761. B, T98 treated

LY2109761 suppressed SMAD2 phosphorylation in both

Because SMAD proteins are central mediators of signals
from TGF-b receptors, we evaluated the effect of LY2109761 on
the phosphorylation of SMAD2 (p-SMAD2), one of their immediate downstream targets. As expected, LY2109761 (10 mmol/L

phosphorylation (Fig. 4).

Further analysis using IPA of differentially regulated genes
with at least 2-fold change (LY, 111 genes; RT, 36 genes; LY þ
RT, 157 genes) revealed 8 functional categories with highly
affected and enriched transcripts (Fig. 5C). The associated
molecular and cellular functions are related to cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation, gene expression, cell
death, cell cycle, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cell
signaling, and molecular transport. For example, the top
function for LY2109761 and radiation alone or their combination was associated with cellular movement, cell death, and
cellular growth and proliferation.
Venn diagrams revealed the treatment-speciﬁc upregulated
and downregulated genes (Fig. 5D) and also the commonly
affected genes (Fig. 5D). A signiﬁcant number of genes were
commonly affected under the treatment of LY2109761 and
radiation plus LY2109761, whereas considerably fewer genes
were commonly affected by radiation and radiation plus
LY2109761, suggesting a comprehensive impact of LY2109761
on radiation response at the gene expression level when
combined with radiotherapy.
LY2109761 enhanced radiation-induced tumor growth
delay in a U87MG subcutaneous xenograft tumor model
in BALB/c nude mice
A tumor growth delay experiment was carried out using
U87MG tumors growing subcutaneously in the hind leg of nude
mice. As shown in Fig. 6A, the time for 5-fold increase in tumor
size (from 150 mm3 to 750 mm3) was calculated using the
tumor volumes from the individual mice in each group. The
mean time for 5-fold increase in tumor size increased from 11.4
days for sham-treated mice to 17.2 days for LY2109761-treated
mice and 23.9 days for irradiated mice. Radiation plus

LY2109761 increased the time to 36.4 days. The tumor growth
delay versus controls was 5.8 days for LY2109761 alone, 12.5
days for radiation alone, and 25.0 days for the combination,
indicating a supra-additive effect between LY2109761 and
radiation on growth delay of U87MG xenografts.
LY2109761 increased survival in an orthotopical CSLC

LY2109761 inhibited tumor invasion and reduced tumor
microvessel density
Previous studies have shown that glioblastoma cells can
express the intermediate neuroﬁlament vimentin, including
those tumor cells that inﬁltrate into normal parenchyma. To
evaluate tumor invasiveness in intracranial tumor sections,
hematoxylin–eosin and immunohistochemical staining for
vimentin was done. As shown in Fig. 7A and B, sham-treated
intracranial xenografts displayed peripheral invasion of the
surrounding brain as single cells and cell clusters, frequently
surrounded by numerous small satellite tumors. Interestingly, a more invasive growth pattern was observed after
radiotherapy alone than controls. In contrast, tumors from
mice receiving LY2109761 monotherapy or LY2109761 plus
radiotherapy displayed a signiﬁcantly reduced invasion
growth pattern compared with the control and radiotherapy
group.
Next, we investigated tumor angiogenesis as another
important process of tumor growth particularly pertinent
in glioblastoma using CD31 endothelial staining and microvessel density (MVD) analysis. We found that LY2109761

The pivotal role of TGF-b in promoting cellular processes
that are important for glioblastoma progression suggests that
this pathway may be a promising target for therapy. In the
present study, we provide evidence that TGF-b signaling
blockade by the small-molecule TGFbR-I kinase inhibitor,
LY2109761, is an effective treatment approach and can moreover augment radiation response in human glioblastoma.
This conclusion is supported by several pieces of evidence.
First, LY2109761 signiﬁcantly enhanced radiation-induced
cytotoxicity and cooperated with radiation to suppress clonogenic survival of established glioblastoma cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that LY2109761 may act in concert
with radiation to enhance radiation-induced DNA damage
and apoptosis. Second, LY2109761 also increased the sensitivity of primary GBM CSLCs derived from surgical specimens
toward radiation. Third, LY2109761 enhanced radiationinduced tumor growth delay in 2 independent models: in
U87MG tumors growing subcutaneously in BALB/c nu/nu
mice and in orthotopic CSLC tumors growing in brains of
SCID mice. In this orthotopic brain tumor model, LY2109761
increased animal survival alone and increased the radiationinduced prolongation of the animal life span.
The interesting ﬁnding that TGF-b inhibition impedes the
cellular DNA damage stress response and results in increased
radiosensitivity had been shown in mammary epithelial cells
(26). While these authors reported a reduced gH2AX foci
number following TGF-b inhibition, we found here an increase
of radiation-induced gH2AX foci number that may be due to
the difference in cell types or TGF-b inhibitors used.
Targeting CSLCs in human tumors including glioblastoma is
an evolving concept for developing new treatment options in
cancer. Stem cells have been reported to be responsible for the
initiation, propagation, recurrence, and radioresistance of gliomas (6). Notably, the most effective targeted therapies may have
activity against CSLCs. Encouragingly, we found that LY2109761
reduced the self-renewal and proliferation capability of GBM
CSLCs and also enhanced the radiosensitivity of GBM CSLCs.
More importantly, LY2109761 further increased the antitumor
effects of radiation and increased animal survival when GBM
CSLCs were injected orthotopically into mice brains.
Invasion is another important feature of human glioblastoma responsible for their dismal outcomes. Although ionizing
radiation is the mainstay of nonsurgical treatment in GBM,
radiation may also promote migration and invasiveness of
glioma cells (27), which has been attributed, in part, to

LY2109761 and Radiation in an Orthotopic Glioblastoma Model

increased levels of TGF-b (28). Accordingly, our results indicated that radiation may promote glioblastoma cell invasion,
whereas the blockade of TGF-b signaling using LY2109761
inhibited both constitutive and radiation-provoked tumor cell
invasion in the orthotopic model.
Activated tumor angiogenesis is another characteristic feature of GBM, contributing to tumor invasiveness and radioresistance. The antiangiogenic effects of targeting TGF-b (29,
30) could be corroborated in our study because LY2109761
alone and in combination with radiation reduced tumor MVD,
indicating that LY2109761 has direct antimigratory and antiangiogenic properties, which can be beneﬁcial in the context of
an attenuation of unwanted side effects of radiotherapy such as
certain promigratory and proangiogenic effects.
The fundamental role for mesenchymal change in promoting invasion, treatment response, and even CSC function in
human carcinoma and GBM invasion is increasingly recognized (6, 31). Recent studies have established that TGF-b is a
master regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) in carcinoma (32). To our best knowledge, its relevance
to mesenchymal change in GBM models has not been reported.
Here, we found that the blockade of TGF-b signaling using
LY2109761 markedly reduced the expression of mesenchymal
markers in the orthotopic glioblastoma model. It is conceivable
that this inhibitory effect on mesenchymal change of
LY2109761, at least partly, contributes to its antimigratory
capacity.
Considering that TGF-b is involved in multiple signaling
pathways, genome-wide microarray analysis was conducted to
investigate potential mechanisms of LY2109761, TGF-b signaling, and radiation interactions. The regulated genes represent
functional classes involved in diverse biologic processes
including cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation,
cell death, cell cycle, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, and
cell signaling. ID1 (along with other ID family members ID2,
ID3, and ID4; data not shown), HEY1, ANGPT2, BIRC2 (cIAP1;
inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1) were among the genes downregulated by LY2109761. ID1 has been reported to promote
invasion, to mediate tumor angiogenesis by production of
VEGF, to be involved in the resistance of cancer cells against
cytotoxic drugs (33), and has also been implicated in CSC
function (34) as well as EMT process (35). Our data are here in
line with a very recent report focusing on the effects of
LY2109761 on ID1 (36). Angiopoietins (ANGPT) are ligands of
the endothelial cell receptor TIE2 and have crucial roles in the
tumor angiogenic switch, inﬂammation, metastasis, and lymphangiogenesis. Increased expression of ANGPT2 and higher
ANGPT2/ANGPT1 ratios in tumors correlate with poor prognosis in many cancers. Agents speciﬁcally targeting ANGPT1
and ANGPT2 are currently in phase II clinical trials (37). High
expression levels of IAPs that inhibit apoptosis have been

associated with poor treatment response and prognosis (38).
In addition, we also identiﬁed and conﬁrmed several genes
upregulated by LY2109761 treatment, including RHOB, LRIG1,
and ACTG2, which act as tumor suppressors and have putative
roles in tumor therapy resistance and DNA damage response
(39–41).
Radiotherapy is an effective treatment modality for glioblastoma. To evade radiation toxicity, certain pathways might
be activated that contribute to tumor invasiveness, angiogenesis, and radioresistance (42, 43). The set of such genes that
were upregulated by radiation and reversed by LY2109761
further included AKT, ATF5, and LMO2. AKT is a major
downstream effector of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
pathway, a potent prosurvival pathway, associated with radioresistance of cancer cells with AKT inhibition having been
shown to increase radiation effects on tumors (44). Activating
transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is highly expressed in malignant
glioma and plays an important role in promoting cell survival
by stimulating transcription of MCL1, an antiapoptotic BCL2
family member (45). ATF5 has been shown to be a potent
repressor of p53, and elevated expression of ATF5 in tumor is
related to radioresistance and greater cell motility (46). The
LIM-domain protein LMO2 is a speciﬁc regulator of tumor
angiogenesis, which has been suggested an attractive drug
target in cancer (47). Together these array data may provide
additional molecular signaling hints for the beneﬁcial effects
observed after combined TGF-b signaling inhibition with
LY2109761 and radiation in the treatment of glioblastoma.
In summary, we have provided evidence that LY2109761, a
speciﬁc TGFbR-I kinase inhibitor, is active against glioblastoma alone and enhances the antitumor efﬁcacy of radiation
both in vitro and in vivo, in particular in GBM CSLCs. Our
ﬁndings rationalize further translational studies of LY2109761
or agents with similar properties alone and in combination
with radiotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma.
