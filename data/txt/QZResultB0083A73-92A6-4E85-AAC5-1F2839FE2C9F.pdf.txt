Abstract

Author Manuscript

Adenoviruses are linear double stranded DNA viruses that infect human and rodent cell lines,
occasionally transform them and cause tumors in animal models. The host cell challenges the virus
in multifaceted ways to restrain viral gene expression and DNA replication, and sometimes even
eliminates the infected cells by programmed cell death. To combat these challenges, adenoviruses
abrogate the cellular DNA damage response pathway. Tip60 is a lysine acetyltransferase that
acetylates histones and other proteins to regulate gene expression, DNA damage response,
apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Tip60 is a bona fide tumor suppressor since mice that are
haploid for Tip60 are predisposed to tumors. We have discovered that Tip60 is degraded by
adenovirus oncoproteins EIB55K and E4orf6 by a proteasome-mediated pathway. Tip60 binds to
the immediate early adenovirus promoter and suppresses adenovirus EIA gene expression, which
is a master regulator of adenovirus transcription, at least partly through retention of the virally
encoded repressor pVII on this promoter. Thus degradation of Tip60 by the adenoviral early
proteins is important for efficient viral early gene transcription and for changes in expression of
cellular genes.

Introduction
Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, linear, double stranded DNA viruses. Discovered in early
1950s, almost 50 human adenoviruses clustered in 6 different species have been identified.
Besides lytic infection, adenoviruses are also known to transform host cells through their

oncogenes EIA and EIB in cooperation with other cellular proteins.1 Although there is no
concrete evidence that adenoviruses are involved in tumor formation in humans they can
transform human cells and can induce tumors in newborn rats. Adenovirus has developed
different strategies to counter host cell defense and usurp the cellular machinery, both for
viral replication and cell transformation. Indeed several paradigms of how viral oncoproteins
transform cells by inactivating cellular tumor suppressors were elucidated in cells
transformed by adenovirus. For example, adenovirus EIA protein binds and inactivates Rb
protein to promote entry of cells into S phase, while EIB55K and E4orf6 oncoproteins bind
and direct p53 for degradation by proteasome to prevent cell-cycle checkpoint activation and
apoptosis. 2–4 Adenovirus also degrades MRN complex proteins, DNA ligase IV, TOPBP1
and integrin alpha 3 (ref.5–8).

Author Manuscript

Many studies have shown widespread changes in DNA and histone modifications during
tumorigenesis.9 Several viral oncoproteins interact with different histone modifying
enzymes of the host cell and deregulate the epigenetic program.10,11 Recently we showed
that the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) oncoprotein E6 interacts with and destabilizes the
cellular histone acetyltransferase protein Tat interacting protein 60 kDa, Tip60 (ref.12).
Intriguingly, the degradation of Tip60 relieved cellular repression of the viral early
promoter. Another recent study showed that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pUL27 can
induce Tip60 degradation by proteasome, though the contribution of this degradation to the
viral life cycle was unclear. 13

Tip60 is a lysine acetyltransferase protein of the MYST family. It modifies the chromatin
structure by acetylating histones and thus plays an important role in transcriptional
regulation.14–16 Tip60 is essential for viability since its disruption causes embryonic
lethality.17 Mice that lack one allele of Tip60 show acceleration in tumorigenesis.18 Tip60
has also been implicated in the DNA damage response: it activates the apex kinases in the
checkpoint pathways, the ATM/ ATR kinases and it stops the DNA damage response by
promoting the dephosphorylation of phosphoH2AX at the DNA damage sites.19–20 Another
non-histone protein acetylated by Tip60 is p53. Tip60 acetylates p53 on lysine120 and shifts
the balance towards apoptosis and away from cell-cycle arrest. 21–22

Author Manuscript

Tumor suppressors like p53 and Rb are inactivated by HPV and adenovirus oncoproteins.
Since Tip60 is a tumor suppressor that is targeted for degradation through proteasome
mediated pathway by the HPV E6 oncoprotein, we investigated whether Tip60 was also
degraded by adenovirus oncoproteins. We discovered that the adenovirus oncoproteins
EIB55K and E4orf6 also direct Tip60 for degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner
and by doing so they relieve the repression imposed by cellular Tip60 on viral early gene
expression. The results highlight a possible role for Tip60 during adenovirus replicative
cycle, and suggest that downregulation of the tumor suppressor Tip60 may be important for
multiple oncogenic viruses.

Results
Adenovirus destabilizes Tip60 protein

Author Manuscript

To check the effect of adenovirus on Tip60 levels, MCF10A breast epithelial cells were
infected with dl309 virus (phenotypically wild type adenovirus). Note that multiple spliceisoforms of Tip60 are expressed at varying ratios in different cell-lines. Tip60 levels were
decreased in the virus (dl309)-infected MCF10A cells compared to mock-infected cells
while the levels of another HAT protein MOF was not decreased (Figure 1A). Similar
results were obtained in U2OS osteosarcoma cells and HCT116 colon cancer cells (Figure
1B). Evaluating MCF10A lysates harvested at various times post-infection showed that both
p53 and Tip60 decreased at about the same time: 64 hr post infection (Figure 1C). The time
of decrease corresponded with significant expression of EIB55K and E4orf6 oncoprotein
(Figure 1C). The half life of Tip60 was determined by shutting off new protein synthesis by
cycloheximide. The half life decreased to <30 min in virus (dl309)-infected cells compared
to >120 min in mock-infected cells (Figure 1D). These data suggest that adenovirus
infection destabilizes cellular Tip60 protein.
EIB55K and E4orf6 oncoproteins are involved in proteasomal mediated degradation of
Tip60

Author Manuscript

To test whether the oncoproteins of adenovirus are involved in the destabilization of Tip60,
we tested different mutants of adenovirus under similar conditions. dl366* virus with a
deletion of the entire E4 region did not affect Tip60 levels, similar to dl355 virus with a
mutation specifically in the E4orf6 gene. dl1520 virus with a deletion in EIB55K gene also
did not decrease Tip60 (Figure 2A). These results suggest the involvement of EIB55K and
E4orf6 proteins in the destabilization of Tip60. To confirm this result and to rule out a role
of other viral proteins, a plasmid expressing HA/flag-Tip60 was co-transfected with
plasmids expressing EIB55K or E4orf6 singly or in combination into U2OS cells. A cotransfected plasmid expressing GST serves as a transfection control. Tip60 levels were
reduced in the cells with both EIB55K and E4orf6 but not with either oncoprotein on its own
(Figure 2B).

Author Manuscript

To test whether the destabilization of Tip60 is due to degradation by proteasomes, dl309infected cells were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Tip60 decrease was
abrogated by MG132 (Figure 2C) implicating proteasomes in the Tip60 degradation.
MLN4924 is a global inhibitor of all cullin Ring E3 ligases, because it inhibits the critical
neddylation of cullins that is essential for their activity. Treatment with MLN4924 also
prevented adenovirus mediated decrease in Tip60 (Figure 2C). Similarly addition of MG132
and MLN4924 prevented the destabilization of transfected HA-Tip60 by co-transfected
EIB55K and E4orf6 expression (Figure 2D).
Cullin-5 and the elongins are known to co-operate with E1B55K and E4orf6 to degrade p53
[4]. In order to determine which cullin was involved in the adenovirus-mediated degradation
of Tip60, we knocked down individual cullin proteins by siRNA transfection in dl309 virusinfected cells. While p53 was stabilized, as expected, by si-Cullin-5, Tip60 was not
stabilized (Figure S1). si-Cullin3 stabilizes Tip60, but since Cullin-3 is known to degrade

Author Manuscript

Tip60 even in uninfected cells,23 we cannot be certain that Cullin-3 is specifically recruited
by EIB55K+E4orf6 to degrade Tip60. To ascertain whether the elongins may be involved in
the degradation of Tip60, we knocked down elongin B by siRNA in dl309 virus-infected
cells. Knockdown of elongin B stabilized p53 but not Tip60 (data not shown) suggesting
that elongins may not be involved in the degradation of Tip60 by E4orf6+EIB55K.

Author Manuscript

The results suggest that as with p53, the E1B55K+E4orf6 viral proteins may interact with
Tip60, to recruit Tip60 to the E3 ligase. To test this, plasmids expressing HA/flag-Tip60
were co-transfected into U2OS cells with plasmids expressing EIB55K and E4orf6 (Figure
2E). Flag/HA-Tip60 was increased in cell lysates when it was stabilized by MG132 (lane 2).
Immunoprecipitation of Tip60 from the MG132-treated cells co-immunoprecipitated
EIB55K and E4orf6 proteins (lane 4). When E4orf6 or EIB55K were transfected singly with
Tip60 and the Tip60 was immunoprecipitated, the viral proteins were coimmunoprecipitated, but to a much lower extent than when they were present together (lanes
7, 9). These results suggest that EIB55K and E4orf6 together form a complex that binds to
Tip60 and possibly recruits Tip60 to an unknown cullin.
Tip60 suppresses EIA expression

Author Manuscript

Since Tip60 is a HAT protein and can act as a coregulator for gene transcription we
hypothesized that degradation of Tip60 might promote viral gene expression. We therefore
checked the expression profiles of different viral genes in cells with wild type Tip60
compared to those with siRNA mediated Tip60-depletion. Tip60 is degraded in dl309
infected cells around 62 hr post-infection, consequently any difference in viral gene
expression due to the experimental knockdown of Tip60 is expected to be transient, before
the virus naturally directs degradation of Tip60. Expression of all the early genes was
increased in siTip60 cells at early times of infection (Figure 3A). Comparing viral gene
expression in siTip60 cells to that in siGL2 cells shows that, EIA expression increased by 3–
4 fold in Tip60 depleted cells, while the other viral genes showed at most a 2-fold increase
in expression (Figure 3B). The E1A protein was also increased in siTip60 cells (Figure
S2A). However, expression of all viral genes became comparable in control and siTip60
cells at 96 hr post infection when the virus degrades Tip60, consistent with our expectation.
These results show that the presence of Tip60 suppresses the EIA mRNA level early in viral
infection.

Author Manuscript

The increase in EIA expression after knockdown of Tip60 could be secondary to virus
replication. To rule this out, we added hydroxyurea (HU) 48 hrs after infection and
harvested the cells at 72 hrs post infection and measured EIA transcript levels. HU did not
prevent the increase in EIA expression when Tip60 was knocked down showing that the
stimulation of E1A expression by siTIP60 is not secondary to an increased number of
templates because of viral DNA replication (Figure S2B).
We next used chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to determine if Tip60 was
preferentially associated with the EIA compared to the Major Late promoter, which remains
unchanged after siTip60. Tip60 was detected at the EIA promoter but not at the ML
promoter (Figure 4A). A cellular promoter known to be regulated by Tip60, nucleolin, and
another unaffected by Tip60, acetylcholine receptor, served as positive and negative

controls, respectively. Primer pairs spanning 6 different regions of the E1A promoter
(Figure S3) indicated that more Tip60 binds near the transcriptional start site of EIA (Figure
4B). ChIP for histone H4 acetylation measures Tip60 activity at the promoter. pVII is an
adenovirus late protein that is known to bind to E1A promoter, represses it and is removed
when transcription of viral DNA starts.24 Both acetylated histone H4 (H4Ac) and pVII
protein were bound to the EIA promoter at 50 hours after infection when Tip60 is not
degraded, and both disappear from the promoter at 80 hours after infection when Tip60 is
degraded (Figure 4C). The strong correlation of Tip60 presence at the E1A promoter with
H4Ac, and with pVII which acts as an anti-correlative marker for transcription synthesis,
supports the hypothesis that by binding to the E1A promoter and through the acetylation of
histone H4, Tip60 represses the E1A promoter.

Author Manuscript

To test this hypothesis, we knocked down Tip60 by siRNA and measured the amount of
H4Ac and pVII at the EIA promoter at 50 and 80 hr post infection. H4Ac and pVII at the
EIA promoter decreased prematurely at 50 hr post infection upon knockdown of Tip60
(Figure 4D). To investigate the role of the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 in retention of
H4Ac at the E1A promoter, the ChIP assays were repeated after virus infections in cells with
vector alone or overexpressing Tip60 wild type or Tip60 HAT mutant. The decrease in
H4Ac and in pVII at the E1A promoter normally seen at 80 hr post-infection was attenuated
by wild type Tip60 but not by the catalytically dead Tip60 (Figure 4E). These results
indicate that catalytically active Tip60 acetylates H4 and thus represses the EIA promoter.

Author Manuscript

To test whether Tip60 can repress the EIA promoter directly, U2OS cells stably overexpressing Tip60 were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter driven by the EIA
promoter (E1ApGL3c). The over-expressed Tip60 significantly repressed the luciferase
activity from E1ApGL3c compared to that driven by the control promoter, pGL3c (Figure
5).
Collectively these results suggest that Tip60 binds to the EIA promoter and represses the
EIA promoter through acetylation of Histone 4.
Tip60 knockdown favors initial establishment of viral DNA synthesis

Author Manuscript

Viral DNA synthesis is dependent on early viral gene expression. Tip60 represses the master
regulator of early viral transcription, EIA. Therefore we hypothesized that adenovirus
degrades Tip60 because the latter has a negative effect on viral DNA replication. To test this
hypothesis, cells transfected with siGL2 or siTip60 were infected with the wild type dl309
virus to determine if diminishing the levels of Tip60 at early times of viral infection leads to
greater viral DNA replication. Indeed, Tip60 knockdown resulted in greater viral DNA
levels at 72 hr post infection (Figure 6A). This result suggest that Tip60 can suppress virus
life cycle.
To ascertain whether the lysine acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 has any role in the
suppression of viral DNA replication, we made cell lines stably transfected with either
empty vector or with plasmids expressing wild Tip60 or catalytically dead Tip60 (Figure
S4). These cells were then infected with dl309 strain and harvested at 72 hrs post infection.
The cells expressing wild type Tip60 had less viral DNA in comparison to cells expressing

catalytically dead Tip60 or transfected with empty vector (Figure 6B). These results show
that the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 suppresses viral DNA synthesis.
Tip60 degradation alters expression of cellular genes
Tip60 acetylates Histones and changes the epigenetic environment of promoters to change
the gene expression profile. We hypothesized that Adenovirus-dependent degradation of
Tip60 might also affect expression of cellular targets of Tip60. Microarray analysis after
Tip60 knockdown in HCT116 cells revealed several genes to be regulated by Tip60 (Dutta
and Dutta, unpublished data). Among these genes Vav-3 and E2F-3 were downregulated by
Tip60 knockdown or after dl309 infection (Figure 7A). The decrease in expression of both
genes coincides with the time of degradation of Tip60 in virus-infected cells: 64 hrs post
infection (Figure 7B). These results suggest that the decrease in expression of Vav-3 and
E2F-3 in dl309 virus infected cells may be dependent on Tip60 degradation.

Author Manuscript

To verify this hypothesis, we measured the expression of both genes in dl309 virus-infected
cells that were stably infected with empty vector or with vector overexpressing Tip60.
Overexpression of Tip60 partially alleviated the repression of Vav-3 and E2F-3 seen in
adenovirus-infected cells (Figure 7C). These results suggest that the degradation of Tip60 by
adenovirus results in repression of two cellular genes that are normally up-regulated by
Tip60.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

We suggest that Tip60-dependent acetylation of H4 at the EIA promoter represses the
immediate early viral promoter. Since EIA is critically important for expression of other
viral genes, the degradation of Tip60 may promote efficient EIA-dependent viral
transcription and regulate expression of cellular genes (Figure 8). While this model offers a
novel perspective on how the degradation of Tip60 by the adenovirus E1B55K and E4orf6
affects the course of a productive infection, Tip60 degradation may also have consequences
for cell transformation by the adenovirus. Different investigative groups have demonstrated
that the EIA protein alters the epigenetic program of the cell. 25–28 EIA binds to the
promoters of genes involved in the cell cycle and growth, cause hypoacetylation at H3K18
and thus stimulates the cell cycle. EIA also binds to the promoters of antiviral genes and
differentiation genes and causes their transcriptional repression. Thus the degradation of
Tip60 is expected to affect the expression of several cellular genes through the induction of
E1A. Our results suggest that in addition, the degradation of Tip60 directly affect the
expression of cellular genes normally regulated by Tip60 (Figure 8).

Author Manuscript

Adenoviruses can cause tumors in rodents and Syrian hamsters and can transform rodent
cells in vitro. In fact, this latter property has been successfully utilized to understand how
viral oncoproteins like E1A and E1B55K inactivate a variety of cellular tumor suppressors
such as Rb and p53. Since Tip60 is a bona fide tumor suppressor,18 and since Tip60 is
known to be degraded by at least one other viral oncogene, HPV E6, we suspect that the
degradation of Tip60 by adenovirus may also be important for cell transformation.

Although there is little evidence of the presence of adenovirus in human cancer there are
reports that suggest a transient requirement of the virus for cell-transformation, following
which the cells lose the virus: the so-called Hit-and-run oncogenesis.29 Increasing evidence
suggests that viral oncoproteins can target epigenetic regulators to alter epigenetic regulation
of the cells.11 Tip60 is an important epigenetic factor. By acetylating histone H4, Tip60
alters the expression of many cellular genes. Tip60 is also very important for a cell’s
response to DNA damage: it activates the checkpoint pathways by activating ATM, 30,31
directs p53 to apoptotic pathways 21,22 and turns off the alarm signal by dephosphorylating
phosphoH2AX at the end of the damage response.20, 32–36 Thus it is conceivable that the
degradation of Tip60 by an adenovirus infection predisposes the host cell to deleterious
mutations caused by DNA damage (Figure 8). Destruction of Tip60 by an adenovirus
infection may thus be part of the “Hit-and-run” method of oncogenesis. Once additional
mutations convert a cell to the frankly transformed state, the viral oncoprotein may no
longer needed.
The adenovirus oncoproteins EIB55K and E4orf6 are required for the destabilization of
Tip60 protein. Chronologically the degradation of Tip60 in adenovirus-infected cells is
nearly concurrent to the degradation of p53 protein. E1B55K and E4orf6 are also important
for the degradation of p53, and they do so by interacting with p53 and recruiting it to a
Cullin-5 complex containing elongins B and C.4 Our experiments suggest that Tip60 is
recruited similarly by E1B55K and E4orf6, perhaps to Cullin-3, but also perhaps to an
unknown E3 ligase complex that is inhibited by the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924.

Author Manuscript

Two studies showed that pVII protein remains associated with viral DNA during the early
stages of infection. The start of viral transcription releases the pVII protein from viral
genome. 24, 37 Our results extend it to say that Tip60 and H4 acetylation at the adenovirus
EIA promoter may be correlated with pVII retention at the promoter. We do not know
whether the acetylation of H4 at the promoter or of some other protein at or away from the
promoter is responsible for the pVII retention and repression of the promoter. The minimum
hypothesis is that the acetylation of H4 by Tip60 at the E1A promoter recruits a cellular
repressor complex, similar to the recruitment of the Brd4 complex at the HPV major early
promoter,12 and that this repressor inhibits EIA transcription.
Since Tip60 suppresses EIA expression, which is the major viral transcription factor, we
were also interested to see the effect of Tip60 knockdown on viral DNA synthesis. The
difference in viral DNA copy number suggests that Tip60 limits the number of viral
genomes recruited for DNA replication.

Author Manuscript

p53 and Rb are major tumor suppressors that are inactivated by diverse oncogenic viruses.
Thus it is quite exciting that oncoproteins from at least two different viruses (HPV and
adenovirus) inactivate Tip60, another known tumor suppressor. Whether the inactivation of
Tip60 by these multiple viruses contributes to viral tumorigenesis or to the viral life cycle
are important questions that need to be addressed. It is worth noting that besides HPV E6
and adenovirus E1B55K+E4orf6, some other viral proteins are known to interact with
Tip60: pUL27 of CMV, Tat protein of HIV, Herpesvirus conserved kinases and KSHV

LANA protein. 13, 38–40 Therefore degradation of or interaction with Tip60 seems to be
important for several types of viruses.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MCF10A (non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line) cells were cultured in DMEM- F12 medium

Figure 8. Model for relief of Tip60 suppression of the EIA promoter by early viral genes and
resultant viral production

The EIA promoter in a fraction of the input viral genomes is suppressed by Tip60 (inactive
pool). Early gene expression from a limited initial pool of active viral genomes leads to
expression of the EIB and E4 genes with concomitant degradation of Tip60 through the
proteasome. The loss of Tip60 de-represses the EIA promoter which leads to high levels of
transcription, viral DNA replication and productive infection.
