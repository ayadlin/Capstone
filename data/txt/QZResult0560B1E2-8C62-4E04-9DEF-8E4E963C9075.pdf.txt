Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Treatment Options for Patients With Refractory Disease
Marina Motta, MD1; William G. Wierda, MD, PhD2; and Alessandra Ferrajoli, MD2

Patients with purine analogue–refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have short survival and
limited treatment options. Defining the best salvage strategies for this population is challenging, because
limited data are available from clinical trials, and because studies have enrolled mixed populations (patients
with recurrent and refractory disease or patients with refractory disease and Richter transformation). Moreover, patients with refractory CLL have a high incidence of unfavorable molecular and clinical features,
such as high-risk genomic profiles, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes, expression of zetachain–associated protein kinase 70, and bulky lymphadenopathies. These patients are also severely immunosuppressed because of the underlying disease and the treatments received, and experience a high rate
of infectious complications that pose an additional difficulty in selecting treatment. Despite these
challenges, in parallel with better characterizations of the biologic features of refractory CLL, the number
of available treatment modalities for this population has increased. Several chemoimmunotherapy combinations have been developed, and novel agents with a different mechanism of action are being investigated
in clinical trials. Furthermore, allogeneic stem cell transplantation with nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens is a therapeutic strategy that is increasingly offered to patients with refractory CLL. Cancer

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common form of adult leukemia, is characterized by a
monoclonal proliferation of mature-appearing lymphocytes with distinctive phenotypic features. CLL is a
heterogeneous disease with variable prognosis; some patients have an indolent course and a virtually normal life expectancy, others have aggressive disease and a short survival.1 Several prognostic factors (including genomic abnormalities such as 17p and 11q deletions, unmutated immunoglobulin [Ig]VH gene,
expression of CD38 and ZAP70, and high b-2-microglobulin levels) have been identified and correlated
with resistance to chemotherapy and more aggressive clinical behavior.2-5
During the last decade, the treatment approach to CLL has dramatically changed from palliative to potentially curative. The goal of treatment has shifted from controlling leukocytosis and disease-related symptoms to
achieving eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD). This shift has occurred because achieving eradication
of MRD has been reported to be associated with improved remission duration and more recently improved
overall survival (OS). Eradication of MRD can be observed after chemoimmunotherapy or can be achieved by

pursuing further consolidation therapy, as suggested by
the experience with alemtuzumab.6-8 We believe that
refractory and recurrent CLL should be considered 2
distinct entities, because they have different prognosis.
However, in many studies these patient populations are
not separated, which makes interpreting the results of
these trials challenging. Refractory CLL is commonly
defined as disease that fails to respond to a therapy
(does not achieve a complete response [CR] or partial
response [PR]) or that progresses within 6 months of
such therapy.9 Recurrent CLL is defined as evidence of
disease progression after 6 months in patients who
had achieved a CR or a PR.9 It is important to acknowledge that over the past years, some of the characteristics
of patients with refractory CLL have changed. For
example, currently, the majority of these patients
not only have failed treatment with single-agent fludarabine, but have failed treatment with a chemoimmunotherapy combination; therefore, refractory
CLL indicates a disease that is not only resistant to
purine analogues or alkylators used as single agents,
but also to combinations that include purine analogues, alkylators, and monoclonal antibodies (in
particular, rituximab) such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR); fludarabine and
cyclophosphamide (FC); fludarabine and rituximab;
and pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab
(PCR).
Patients with refractory CLL also have a high
incidence of unfavorable molecular and clinical features. Greater than half of these patients carry unfavorable genetic abnormalities, such as 17p13 and
11q23 deletions, unmutated IgVH gene and bulky
disease (lymph node[s] measuring >5 cm in dimension). Also, patients with refractory disease often have
severe immunosuppression derived from the underlying disease and recent immunosuppressive treatments.
According to retrospective studies, the incidence of
severe infections in this population is as high as
30% with any given treatment, and the median survival duration is <10 months.10,11
In this review, we will summarize the results that
have been achieved with purine analogue-based therapies,
monoclonal antibody treatment, allogeneic stem cell
transplantation, and newer agents in clinical development
in patients with refractory CLL.10-14

PURINE ANALOGUE-CONTAINING
REGIMEN
FCR
Fludarabine is the purine analogue most commonly used
in the treatment of CLL. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent with some single-agent activity in CLL. The
rationale for using it in combination with fludarabine is
based on the ability of fludarabine to inhibit the excision
repair of DNA interstrand cross-links induced by cyclophosphamide and therefore to potentiate its cytotoxic
activity in CLL cells.15 O’Brien et al16 reported that the
FC combination was efficacious in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL, yielding an overall response (OR)
rate of 38%; most of the remissions were partial, with a
median time to progression of <1 year. The addition of
rituximab to fludarabine or other purine analogues has
been associated with improved efficacy, possibly owing to
the ability of fludarabine to down-regulate the expression
of complement-resistance proteins CD55 and CD59 and
therefore potentiate rituximab complement–mediated
cytotoxicity. Rituximab also has the ability to down-regulate the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2,
thereby enhancing the sensitivity of CLL cells to fludarabine-induced apoptosis. In a study that evaluated FCR in
previously treated patients with CLL, CR was achieved in
25% of 177 patients; nodular PR (nPR) and PR were
achieved in 16% and 32% of the patients, respectively;
the OR rate was 73%, and molecular disease remission
was achieved in approximately 33% of patients achieving
CR.17 There were 37 fludarabine-refractory patients in
this study; 5% achieved CR, 11% achieved nPR, and
43% achieved PR, with an OR rate of 59% (Table 1).17
PCR
Pentostatin (2-deoxycoformicin) is a purine analogue
reported to have single-agent activity in CLL. Pentostatin
has the potential advantage of being less myelosuppressive
than fludarabine.18 Weiss et al19 reported an OR rate of
77% with the combination of pentostatin plus cyclophosphamide in 13 patients with refractory CLL. The PCR
combination has been investigated in patients with recurrent or refractory CLL. The study population reported by
Lamanna et al20 consisted of 32 patients; only 8 patients
had disease that was refractory to fludarabine. Among the

refractory patients, responses were achieved in 6 (75%),
including 1 CR. This treatment was well tolerated and
easy to administer, consisting of a 1-day regimen with
pentostatin at a dose of 4 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at a
dose of 600 mg/m2, and rituximab at a dose of 375
mg/m2 starting on Cycle 2 for a total of 6 cycles. A PCR
regimen with a lower dose of pentostatin (2 mg/m2) has
also been investigated,21 but to our knowledge, there are
no data available with the lower dose of pentostatin in the
refractory disease population.

Cyclophosphamide, fludarabine,
alemtuzumab, and rituximab
Cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, alemtuzumab, and rituximab (CFAR) combines FCR with the monoclonal
3832

antibody alemtuzumab.22 The rationale for this combination is based on the synergy demonstrated between alemtuzumab and rituximab,23 and on the unique properties
of alemtuzumab in terms of its efficacy in patients with
17p abnormalities. Furthermore, the mechanism of action
of alemtuzumab appears different and independent from
those of purine analogues. In the CFAR regimen, alemtuzumab is given intravenously in 30-mg doses on Days 1,
3, and 5 of each 28-day treatment course for 6 intended
courses. As with similar regimens associated with severe
lymphopenia, antiviral and anti–Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxes are required. In addition, the risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation needs to be considered. The
CFAR combination is associated with significant myelosuppression, and growth factors are routinely used. As
with all chemoimmunotherapy combinations, allopurinol

should be given routinely for tumor lysis prophylaxis during the first cycle.22 The CFAR study of Wierda et al22
enrolled patients with fludarabine-refractory disease, and
preliminary results indicated an OR rate of 66% and a CR
rate of 26%, suggesting clinical activity with this
combination.

Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and
oblimersen
The expression of Bcl-2 protein is associated with
chemotherapy resistance and decreased survival in
patients with CLL.24 Recently, O’Brien et al25 demonstrated that the addition of the Bcl-2 antisense oblimersen sodium to FC significantly increased the rate
of CR/nPR in patients with recurrent or refractory
CLL. The improved response rate appears to almost
exclusively benefit the patients with fludarabine-sensitive disease according to recently updated data by
O’Brien et al.26

Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and
mitoxantrone
In an attempt to increase the apoptotic effect induced
by fludarabine in CLL cells, the combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone has been
investigated. Bellosillo et al27 demonstrated a synergistic
effect of fludarabine and mitoxantrone on CLL cells.
On the basis of these data, Bosch et al28 conducted a
trial in which 37 patients with recurrent or refractory
CLL were treated with FCM. Fludarabine was given
intravenously at a dose of 25 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 3,
cyclophosphamide at a dose of 200 mg/m2 was given
on Days 1 to 3, and mitoxantrone at a dose of 6
mg/m2 was given on Days 1 to 3 in 4-week intervals for
up to 6 courses. An additional 23 patients received
FCM with cyclophosphamide at a dose of 600 mg/m2
and mitoxantrone at a dose of 8 mg/m2 on Day 1. CRs
were achieved in 50% of patients, MRD negativity was
observed in 17%, and PRs were achieved in 28%. The
median duration of response was 19 months. The
median survival from the initiation of chemotherapy
was 41 months, whereas the median survival for patients
who achieved MRD negativity and CR was not reached;
it was 25 months for patients not achieving CR.

Fludarabine, cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and
dexamethasone
Mauro et al29 investigated the combination of fludarabine, cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone in
patients with recurrent disease. This combination was
developed based on potential synergy between cytarabine
and fludarabine and the known activity of mitoxantrone
and dexamethasone in lymphoproliferative disorders.
Because of its myelosuppressive effect, this treatment was
offered only to patients aged 60 years. Thirty-one
patients were treated, including 14 with fludarabinerefractory disease. OR in the patients with refractory CLL
was 50%, with 29% achieving a CR.
Fludarabine and alemtuzumab
Single-agent alemtuzumab is active in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL, with disease in blood and bone
marrow being particularly sensitive to this agent.30 Kennedy et al31 and Elter et al32 reported their results with fludarabine and alemtuzumab (FluCam) in patients with
recurrent or refractory CLL. The latter study demonstrated an OR rate of 83% with 11 CRs, 19 PRs, 1 patient
with stable disease, and 5 patients with progressive disease
(of 36 treated patients). Notably, the patient responses
observed in this trial were achieved with a cumulative
FluCam dose that was lower than the single-agent dose.
Oxaliplatin, fludarabine, cytarabine,
and rituximab
It is known that fludarabine and cytarabine act in a synergistic fashion based on the ability of fludarabine to inhibit
the resynthesis step of excision repair and increase the level
of arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate in CLL leukemia cells.13 The third-generation platinum compound
oxaliplatin was added because platinum compounds
induce DNA interstrand cross-links. Oxaliplatin also has
a lower renal and auditory toxicity than other platinum
compounds. Tsimberidou et al33 studied the oxaliplatin,
fludarabine, cytarabine, and rituximab combination in a
phase 1/2 study that enrolled patients with fludarabinerefractory disease as well as patients with Richter transformation. The phase 1 component was based on increasing
doses of oxaliplatin (17.5 to 25 mg/m2) and fixed doses of
fludarabine, cytarabine, and rituximab. Of the 30 patients

with fludarabine-refractory disease, 28 were evaluable; 2
patients achieved CR, and 8 achieved PR. It is interesting
to note is that the responses were noted mostly at the
25-mg dose of oxaliplatin.

MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES
Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is a humanized immunoglobulin-1 monoclonal antibody against the human
CD52 antigen. Alemtuzumab has shown encouraging
activity as a single agent and in combination regimens.23,30-32,34-42 The OR and CR rates across trials with
alemtuzumab as a single agent were 41% (range, 31%54%) and 11% (range, 0%-36%), respectively (Table 2).
Clinical activity was demonstrated in heavily pretreated
patients, including those with fludarabine-refractory
CLL. Keating et al35 reported the results of a large, international study of alemtuzumab in 93 patients exposed to
alkylating agents who had failed to respond to fludarabine
therapy. The alemtuzumab dose was 30 mg, 3 times a
week, for a maximum of 12 weeks. The overall median
survival was 16 months for the overall population and 32
months for responders, with a median time to disease progression of 4.7 months and 9.5 months, respectively. Of
note, the antitumor effect of alemtuzumab was more significant in blood and bone marrow than in lymph nodes.
Patients with lymph nodes measuring 5 cm in dimension were significantly less likely to respond to alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab has clinical activity in patients with
deletion 17p13, a known unfavorable genomic aberration. Lozanski et al42 reported the results with alemtuzu3834

mab treatment in 36 patients with recurrent CLL,
including 15 patients with p53 mutations or deletion, and
clinical responses were observed in 40%. In 2005, Moreton et al6 in a nonrandomized clinical trial reported that
prolonged treatment with alemtuzumab with the goal of
eradicating residual disease was associated with improved
OS and treatment-free survival. In this study, 91 patients
received alemtuzumab at a dose of 30 mg 3 times a week
until maximum response was achieved; 44 patients with
fludarabine-refractory CLL were included in this trial.
The median OS was longer in MRD-negative patients
than in those who had an MRD-positive CR; the median
survival was not reached for patients with MRD-negative
CRs, was 60 months for patients with MRD-positive
CRs, was 70 months for patients with PRs, and was 15
months for patients in whom the response was not
reported. Recently, Stilgenbauer et al38 reported the
results of the CLL2H trial of the German CLL Study
Group with subcutaneous alemtuzumab in fludarabinerefractory patients. In this study, 103 patients received
alemtuzumab at a dose of 30 mg 3 times a week. The OR
rate was 34% (4% CR rate and 30% PR rate), the median
progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.7 months, and the
median OS was 19.1 months.
To our knowledge, the optimal dose and schedule of
alemtuzumab remain to be defined. The most common
infusion-related adverse events are rigors, fever, dyspnea,
skin rash, and hypotension, and these symptoms may be
significantly reduced by using the subcutaneous route of
administration. Other common toxicities include
cytopenias and opportunistic infections, particularly
Cancer

Treatment Options for Refractory CLL/Motta et al

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, as well as reactivation of
herpes viruses. Most patients receive trimethoprim-sulfa
twice daily 3 times a week and daily antiherpes virus treatment with acyclovir, famcyclovir, or valacyclovir. CMV
reactivation may occur in patients receiving alemtuzumab-based therapy. Careful and frequent monitoring of
CMV status is mandatory in patients receiving this therapy to institute prompt treatment of patients who develop
CMV reactivation. Oral valganciclovir given daily has
been found by O’Brien et al to be an efficient strategy to
prevent CMV reactivation and associated complications.
However, need for daily dosing, the potential for myelosuppression, and the significant cost of this treatment may
limit its routine use.43
Faderl et al23 explored the use of rituximab and
alemtuzumab in combination. In a population of 48 heavily pretreated patients with lymphoproliferative disorders,
greater than half of whom were refractory to fludarabine,
the OR rate was 52%, with an 8% CR rate, indicating
good clinical activity in a group of patients with advanced
disease. This combination was also tested by Nabhan et al
in a small pilot study41 of 12 patients with recurrent and/
or refractory CLL. In this study, 3 different doses of alemtuzumab were explored in combination with rituximab.
This combination was found to be safe, with only 1
patient achieving a PR and all other patients having stable
disease.
It is known that rituximab when used as a single
agent has only minimal activity in patients with refractory
CLL.44-47 Recently, Castro et al48 reported a small experience with the combination of rituximab and high-dose
methylprednisolone (HDMP) in 14 patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL. The OR rate was 93%, and the CR
rate was 36%. The median time to progression was 15
months in this study. Similar results with the same dose
and schedule of HDMP-rituximab were reported by
Bowen et al49 in 37 patients with recurrent CLL and
unfavorable cytogenetic features. The OR rate was 78%,
the CR rate was 22%, and the PR rate was 57%; the
median PFS was 1 year in this group of patients. Dungarwalla et al50 also explored the HDMP-rituximab combination in 14 patients with advanced CLL that was
resistant to fludarabine therapy. The OR rate was 93%,
CRs were observed in 2 patients, and the median response
duration was 7 months. This combination was associated
with a high rate of severe infectious complications, such as
Cancer

September 1, 2009

invasive aspergillum and Candida infections likely related
to the use of steroids in the experiences reported by Bowen
et al and Dungarwalla et al,49,50 whereas in the study by
Castro et al,48 only 1 patient had infection-related complications. This difference in the occurrence of infection
complications between the studies may be because of the
small number of patients studied.
Lumiliximab is a macaque-human primatized
monoclonal antibody that targets CD23, an antigen
expressed on activated B cells and CLL cells. In a phase 1
study, lumiliximab was found to decrease absolute lymphocyte counts in 91% of patients with refractory or
recurrent CLL and reduced lymph node size in approximately 52%.51 Although none of the patients attained a
CR or a PR, lumiliximab appeared to have clinical activity
and to be well tolerated. Therefore, based on the activity
of lumiliximab as a single agent, the combination of FCR
plus lumiliximab has been explored. Byrd et al52 reported
an OR rate of 71% and a CR rate of 52% in 31 evaluable
patients. No significant toxicity was noted with the concomitant administration of the 2 antibodies beginning
with Cycle 2.
Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. Ofatumumab binds to a different epitope
on the CD20 antigen and therefore has the potential to
overcome some of the limitations of rituximab, such as
low antigen density and shedding. Coiffier et al53 published the results of a phase 1/2 study using ofatumumab
in patients with recurrent or refractory CLL. Patients were
divided into 3 cohorts receiving 4 weekly infusions of ofatumumab at 3 different doses. The OR rate in the higher
dose cohort was 50%, with 12 PRs and 1 nPR reported.
Recently, Osteborg et al54 conducted an international,
multicenter, pivotal study of ofatumumab in CLL
patients with disease that was refractory to fludarabine
and alemtuzumab (double refractory) or refractory to fludarabine with bulky lymphadenopathies (bulky fludarabine-refractory). One patient achieved CR; the OR rate
was 51% for the double refractory patients and 44% for
the bulky fludarabine-refractory patients. The median
time to next therapy and the median OS for the 2 patient
groups were 9 months and 8 months and 14 months and
15 months, respectively. In the initial experience, the toxicity of ofatumumab appears to be similar to that of rituximab, consisting mainly in infusion reactions.
Ofatumumab is currently undergoing further evaluation

in clinical trials both as a single agent and in combination
with chemotherapy.

AGENTS WITH A DIFFERENT
MECHANISM OF ACTION:
BENDAMUSTINE, FLAVOPIRIDOL,
AND LENALIDOMIDE
Bendamustine is a chemotherapeutic agent with both an
alkylating and purine analogue–like structure that has
been investigated in patients with CLL both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents (Table 3).55,56
Bremer57 reported that bendamustine is able to induce a
high number of disease remissions in patients with CLL,
including patients with prior treatment with alkylators. In
2005, the German CLL Study Group published the
results of a phase 1-2 study of 16 patients with recurrent
or refractory CLL.58 The OR rate was 56%; 2 patients
achieved a CR, 5 patients achieved a PR, and the median
duration of response was 42.7 months. The combination
of bendamustine, mitoxantrone, and rituximab was also
tested in patients with recurrent and refractory lymphoproliferative disorders.59 Twenty-one patients with CLL,
6 of whom (27%) had received prior treatment with
fludarabine, were treated in this study. Patients with CLL
received a lower dose of bendamustine (80 mg/m2) on
Days 1 to 2; mitoxantrone at a dose of 10 mg/m2 on Day
3836

1; and rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on Days 8, 15,
22, and 29. The administration of bendamustine was
repeated on Days 36 through 37, and mitoxantrone was
repeated on Day 36 and every 4 weeks thereafter up to a
maximum of 6 cycles. The OR rate in patients with CLL
was 95%, with 23% of patients achieving a CR and 73%
of patients achieving a PR.
Flavopiridol is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
with preclinical activity in CLL. This agent also appears to
down-regulate Mcl-1. Interestingly, flavopiridol-induced
apoptosis is independent of p53 and caspase activation,
and therefore this agent is potentially able to overcome
some of the mechanisms associated with fludarabine
resistance. Furthermore, flavopiridol has shown activity in
patients with bulky lymph node disease. Recently, Phelps
et al60 reported the final results of a phase 1 study of flavopiridol in 52 patients with recurrent CLL and high-risk
features. Partial responses were observed in 40% of the
patients. Activity was observed both in patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL and in those with high-risk
genomic aberrations. Treatment with flavopiridol has
been accompanied by the development of acute tumor
lysis and cytokine release syndrome; therefore the use of
flavopiridol requires careful patient selection (excluding
patients with a high lymphocytes count) and close monitoring during the initial treatment phase. The first treatment with flavopiridol should be administered in the

inpatient setting, with close monitoring of electrolyte levels in a center with the capability to perform emergency
dialysis if needed.
Lenalidomide is a derivative of thalidomide and
belongs to a new class of drugs called immunomodulating
agents. Lenalidomide has antitumor activity in multiple
myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes.61-63 To our
knowledge, the exact mechanisms of action of lenalidomide in CLL are not known, but are likely to be different
from those of classic chemotherapeutic agents. This is a
field of active investigation; available data suggest that
immunomodulation may be important. Ramsay et al
were able to demonstrate improved immunologic synapse
formation after T cells and autologous CLL cells were
exposed to lenalidomide in vitro.64
Two phase 2 trials in patients with recurrent or refractory CLL suggest its clinical activity as a single agent.
Chanan-Khan et al65 administered lenalidomide orally at
a dose of 25 mg on Days 1 through 21 of a 28-day cycle to
45 patients with recurrent CLL (51% of the patients were
refractory to fludarabine). The OR rate was 47%, with
9% of the patients attaining a CR. Ferrajoli et al66
reported the results of a phase 2 study of low-dose lenalidomide in patients with recurrent and refractory CLL.
Lenalidomide was given orally at a dose of a 10 mg/day
for 4 weeks, followed by dose escalation by 5 mg every 28
days to a maximum dose of 25 mg/day. Forty-four
patients were enrolled; 27% of the patients had disease
that was refractory to fludarabine, 88% had unmutated
IgVH genes, and 59% carried a poor prognostic genomic
abnormality (deletion 11q or 17p). The OR rate was
32%, and 7% of patients achieved a CR. Several clinical
studies with this agent are currently ongoing to define the
optimal dosing schedule and to explore the use of lenalidomide in combination. The most common toxicity
observed with this agent has been myelosuppression, in
particular neutropenia. Tumor flare reaction, consisting
of the rapid development of enlarged and tender lymph
nodes, has also been observed and has been more common
with the starting dose of 25 mg and in patients with bulky
lymphoadenopathies.67 Tumor lysis syndrome has also
been observed; predisposing factors appear to be marked
lymphocytosis and compromised renal function.
Adequate hydration, the use of allopurinol, and close laboratory and clinical monitoring are required while
patients are undergoing treatment with lenalidomide.

ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL
TRANSPLANTATION
The development of reduced-intensity conditioning
(RIC) regimens has improved the tolerability of allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), and
therefore this strategy is increasingly offered to older
patients with refractory disease. Moreover, RIC allows
preservation of the graft-versus-leukemia effect and further immunomanipulation.68-70 Schetelig et al71 published the results of RIC HCT in 30 patients with
advanced CLL. After a median follow-up of 2 years, 23
patients were alive, 40% of patients had achieved a CR,
53% of patients had achieved a PR, and acute and chronic
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was observed in 56%
and 75% of patients, respectively. Dreger et al72 retrospectively compared 73 cases of RIC HCTs with 82 conventional allogeneic transplants. RIC HCTs were
associated with a reduced treatment-related mortality
compared with conventional allogeneic transplants; however, RIC transplants were also associated with a higher
incidence of disease recurrence. Sorror et al73 reported on
82 patients with advanced CLL who were treated with
nonmyeloablative conditioning (2-gray total body irradiation with or without fludarabine) and HCT from related
or unrelated donors. The OR rate was 70% (55% CR
rate). The 5-year incidences of nonrecurrence mortality,
disease progression/recurrence, OS, and PFS were 23%,
38%, 50%, and 39%, respectively. The incidence of
grades 2, 3, and 4 acute and chronic GVHD was 39%,
14%, and 2%, respectively, among related recipients and
was 43%, 20%, and 3%, respectively, among unrelated
recipients. The 5-year cumulative incidence of chronic
extensive GVHD was 49% for related and 53% for unrelated recipients. Unrelated HCT resulted in higher CR
and lower recurrence rates than related HCT, suggesting
more effective graft-versus-leukemia activity. Khouri
et al74 reported on the importance of adding rituximab to
RIC HCT and on the role of immunomanipulation in
this setting; 9 of 17 patients had disease that was refractory
to fludarabine and underwent RIC HCT. The OR rate
was 94%. The addition of rituximab was accompanied by
a survival advantage (100% vs 14%) with respect to the
small number of patients who received RIC HCT without
rituximab. In 7 of 10 patients with persistent disease
after HCT, a CR was successfully induced with
3837

immunomanipulation that included withdrawal of
immunosuppressive agents, donor lymphocyte infusion,
and treatment with rituximab. Even if encouraging,
these results need to be confirmed in larger studies.
Recently, the European Group for Blood and Marrow
Transplantation transplant consensus published the
indications for HCT in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.75 Allogeneic HCT is a reasonable treatment
option for eligible patients with previously treated,
poor-risk CLL. Criteria for poor-risk disease are lack of
response or disease recurrence within 12 months after
purine analogue–containing therapy, recurrence within
24 months after purine analogue combination therapy
or treatment of similar efficacy (ie, autologous HCT),
and patients with recurrent/refractory disease with evidence of p53 deletion or mutation.
Conclusions
Multiple treatment options have emerged for patients
with recurrent and refractory CLL. Current data from
consolidation strategies (such as alemtuzumab) reported
by several groups,6-8 as well as the correlation between
quality of response and response duration after allogeneic HCT,76 have suggested that achieving a negative
MRD status is associated with longer PFS and OS.
Thus, strategies that are able to eliminate MRD are
also likely to improve the survival outcome of patients
with refractory disease. Allogeneic HCT, which has a
therapeutic basis in the immune response against leukemia, should be considered as a preferred treatment
option for younger patients with poor-risk disease and
in patients with primary treatment failure. Developing
a better understanding of the biology of the disease,
including the microenvironment interactions, might
enable researchers to identify effective and targeted
treatments and potentially curative strategies for
patients with refractory CLL.
