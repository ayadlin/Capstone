ABSTRACT
The ETS-related transcription factor Fli-1 affects many developmental programs
including erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation, and is frequently de-regulated
in cancer. Fli-1 was initially isolated following retrovirus insertional mutagenesis
screens for leukemic initiator genes, and accordingly, inhibition of this transcription
factor can suppress leukemia through induction of erythroid differentiation. To
search for modulators of Fli-1, we hereby performed repurposing drug screens
with compounds isolated from Chinese medicinal plants. We identified agents that
can transcriptionally activate or inhibit a Fli-1 reporter. Remarkably, agents that
increased Fli-1 transcriptional activity conferred a strong anti-cancer activity upon
Fli-1-expressing leukemic cells in culture. As opposed to drugs that suppress Fli1
activity and lead to erythroid differentiation, growth suppression by these new
Fli-1 transactivating compounds involved erythroid to megakaryocytic conversion
(EMC). The identified compounds are structurally related to diterpene family of small
molecules, which are known agonists of protein kinase C (PKC). In accordance, these
PKC agonists (PKCAs) induced PKC phosphorylation leading to activation of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, increased cell attachment and
EMC, whereas pharmacological inhibition of PKC or MAPK diminished the effect of
our PKCAs. Moreover, in a mouse model of leukemia initiated by Fli-1 activation, the
PKCA compounds exhibited strong anti-cancer activity, which was accompanied by
increased presence of CD41/CD61 positive megakaryocytic cells in leukemic spleens.
Thus, PKC agonists offer a novel approach to combat Fli-1-induced leukemia, and
possibly other cancers,by inducing EMC in part through over-activation of the PKCMAPK-Fli-1 pathway.

INTRODUCTION

with a reporter plasmid, FB-Luc, in which two consensus
Fli-1 binding sites are inserted upstream of a minimal
promoter [23]. About 1500 compounds from Chinese
medicinal plants and their derivatives were tested for
induction or repression of luciferase activity using high
content screen in 96 well plates. Several compounds
capable of activating or inactivating Fli-1 transcriptional
activity of FB-Luc have been identified. Like our previous
study [23], the anti-Fli-1 inhibitors induced erythroid
differentiation and suppressed growth (unpublished
results). Here we focused on 5 compounds, structurally
classified into two groups (Figure 1A), which strongly
increase Fli-1 transcriptional activity. Representatives
of group A (A75 = JCY30) and group B (A236 = HE22) increased luciferase activity of the Fli-1 reporter
plasmid around seven fold when co-transfected together
with MigR1-Fli-1 expression vector into HEK293T cells
(Figure 1B). These two compounds increased luciferase
activity of control plasmid driven by the CMV promoter
(CMV-Luc) three folds, but had no effect on control
TERC and GLP-1R promoter constructs (Figure 1C).
Other compounds identified by our screen exhibited Fli-1
transactivating activity similar to A75 and A236 (data not
shown).

Transcription factors (TFs) are frequently modulated
during cancer initiation and progression [1, 2]. Despite
difficulties in targeting TFs for inhibition, new strategies
including siRNA/miRNA knockdown, disruption of
protein-protein interaction and modulation of chromatin
accessibility are being developed to meet this challenge [1].
Members of ETS family of TFs are often altered in various
cancers, including leukemia [2]. The Friend Leukemia
virus integration-1 (Fli-1), a member of ETS gene family, is
activated by retroviral insertional mutagenesis in F-MuLVinduced erythroleukemias [3, 4]. This TF also undergoes
translocation in most human Ewing sarcomas, generating
an EWS-Fli-1 fusion protein with potent oncogenic
activity [5]. Fli-1 activation affects several hallmarks of
cancer including proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation,
angiogenesis, genomic instability and immune function
[2]. Fli-1 expression is induced in various human cancers
including breast, melanoma, lymphomas and leukemia
[6–11]. In breast cancer, Fli-1 expression is correlated with
tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis [12, 13]. In addition
to cancer, Fli-1 affects various human autoimmune diseases
including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and
Systemic sclerosis/scleroderma [14–18]. Based on these
diverse biological properties, Fli-1 may be an excellent
therapeutic target for various diseases and cancers that are
driven by high levels of this ETS factor.
In the past decade, several strategies have been
employed to isolate inhibitors for Fli-1 or EWS-Fli-1.
These efforts resulted in identification of small molecules
targeting DNA - or RNA-binding activity of Fli-1 [19–22].
Our group has used a luciferase-based expression assay
to identify antagonists of Fli-1, some of which displayed
strong anti-cancer activity in culture and animal models
of leukemia [23]. Among these agents was a class of
anti-Fli-1 compounds that altered calcium uptake and
inhibited protein kinase C-delta (PKCδ). These PKCδ
inhibitors blocked the phosphorylation of Fli-1, an event
that is a critical for inducing its DNA binding activity
[23, 24]. Unfortunately, these anti-Fli-1 compounds bind
other targets in addition to PKCδ, and, there is therefore a
pressing need to identify specific inhibitors of Fli-1. Here we
describe a repurposing drug screen with Chinese medicinal
compounds, and the identification and characterization of
potent Fli-1 activating compounds. Remarkably, we show
that induction of Fli-1 via these compounds induce erythroid
to megakaryocytic differentiation (EMD) via PKCγ and
suppress leukemogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.

Fli-1 transactivating compounds exhibit
biological properties similar to the phorbol ester
compound TPA
Fli-1 transactivating compounds are structurally
related to diterpenes, a family of drugs including
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which
promotes tumorigenesis when applied to the skin [25, 26].
To determine their biological activity, leukemic cell lines
expressing high or low levels of Fli-1 were treated with the
compounds. Treatment of murine erythroleukemia cell line
CB7 with A75 increased cell size and attachment (Figure
2A). Cell enlargement was accompanied by polyploidy
with appearance of N2, N4 and N8 chromosomes
(Figure 2B). Similar characteristics were previously
reported in erythroleukemic cells treated with TPA, as
demonstrated in Figure 2A and 2B [27]. Growth inhibition
by both A75 and TPA was long lasting even when these
agents were removed from the culture three days post
treatment (Figure 2C). A similar trend of cell attachment,
polyploidy and growth inhibition was observed in the
human erythroleukemia cell line HEL (not shown). Other
compounds listed in Figure 1A exhibited similar growth
inhibition as A75 (data not shown).
Like CB7 and HEL, the human erythroleukemia cell
line K562, which does not express detectable levels of Fli1, ceased proliferation in culture after treatment with A75
or TPA (Figure 2D). However, unlike CB7 and HEL, the
majority of K562 cells underwent apoptosis shortly after
treatment (Figure 2E), which was associated with G2M cell
cycle arrest (Figure 2F). Notably, Fli-1 expression was not
induced in K562 cells by these compounds (Figure 2G). This

is in contrast to the effect of TPA, which was reported to
induce Fli-1 expression in these cells [28–30]. While both
Fli-1 expressing CB7 and HEL cells treated with A236 and
TPA compounds underwent differentiation to express high
levels of the megakaryocyte marker CD41, K562 cells
were unaffected compared to control DMSO-treated cells
(Figure 3A–3C). Similar results were observed with K562
cells obtained from two different sources/countries. In HEL
cells, the increased intensity of CD41 expression induced by
the A75 and TPA compounds can be blocked by treatment
with the previously identified Fli-1 inhibitor Calcimycin [23]
(Figure 4A).
To further assess the effect of Fli-1 expression on
K562 cell differentiation, we used a doxycycline (DOX)
inducible system, which enabled us to overcome the cell
death induced by Fli-1 in these cells. Dox-dependent
induction of Fli-1 in K562-Fli-1indu-20-on cells (Figure 4B)
resulted in appearance of large, polynucleated cells (Figure
4C). Remarkably, Fli-1 expression in these cells induced
CD41 levels (Figure 4D). CD41 expression was further
elevated when K562-Fli-1indu-20-on cells were treated with
both DOX and A75, A236 and TPA compounds (Figure
4D). Overall, these results demonstrate that while Fli-1 is
critical for megakaryocyte differentiation of K562 cells,
in the absence of this TF, these compounds alter other
pathway(s) to promote apoptosis.

for induction of MAPK phosphorylation. In CB7 cells
treated with several Fli-1 transactivating compounds,
we observed rapid phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK
(Figure 5A). Similar to TPA, ERK phosphorylation was
blocked by treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126
(U) and partially by the RAF inhibitor Sorafenib (St),
but not with the JNK or p38 inhibitors SP600125 and
SB203580, respectively (Figure 5B). Similar MAPK
phosphorylation by these compounds and inhibition by
U0126 were observed in the erythroleukemia cell line
HEL (Figure 5C). In K562 cells carrying a BCR-ABL
translocation, treatment with U0126 was not sufficient
to block MAPK/ERK phosphorylation induced by A75
and TPA compounds. Addition of both U0126 and the
BCR-ABL inhibitor Imatinib was required to block this
phosphorylation (Figure 5D). Thus, Fli-1 transactivating
compounds may cooperate with Imatinib for the
treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
driven by BCR-ABL.
Finally, we examined whether Fli-1 activation
by these agents is mediated by MAPK/ERK
phosphorylation. Transient transfection of FB-Luc
plasmid with MigR1-Fli-1 expression vector into
HEK293T cells resulted in several fold increase in
luciferase activity after treatment for 12 hours with
A236, A75, A89 and TPA compounds, and this was
blocked by the MEK inhibitor U0126 (Figure 5E).
Again, the JNK or p38 inhibitors SP600125 and
SB203580 had no effect on this transcriptional activity
(data not shown), pointing to MAPK/ERK as the
downstream effector of Fli-1 transcriptional activation
by these compounds.

Fli-1 transactivating compounds signal through
the MAPK pathway
Since TPA is a known inducer of mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) [31], we tested our compounds

Differentiation induced by Fli-1 transactivating
compounds is mediated through suppression
of erythroid and induction of megakaryocytic
target genes

megakaryocytic differentiation (Figure 4D). We also
examined the expression of Fli-1 target gene GATA1
whose transcription is negatively regulated by Fli-1
and is necessary for both erythroid and megakaryocytic
differentiation [29, 35, 36]. In HEL cells, TPA, A236 and
A75 at 2μM significantly downregulated GATA1 mRNA
(Figure 6C), but higher expression of this TF was detected
at 5μM of these drugs (Figure 6D). In K562 cells, these
compounds strongly downregulated GATA1 expression
(Figure 7C). The Fli-1 induction in K562 cells led to
suppression of GATA1, but this drop in expression was
moderate compared with levels seen in the drug-treated
K562 cells (Figure 7C and 7I). These results suggest that
while the compounds downregulated GATA1 at lower
concentration through a Fli-1-dependent mechanism,
this suppression was inhibited at higher concentration
of drugs, allowing this TF to promote megakaryocytic
differentiation.
Next, we examined the effect of the Fli-1
transactivating compounds on erythroid differentiation.
The transcription factor EKLF is directly suppressed by
Fli-1 [37–39], whereas globin gene expression in indirectly
regulated by this TF [4]. We found expression of both
EKLF and globin was downregulated in HEL cells (Figure
6E and 6F) as well as in K562 cells (Figure 7D and 7E), 3
day post compound treatment. In K562-Fli-1indu-20-on cells
treated with DOX, EKLF and globin gene expression was
suppressed, albeit more moderately (Figure 7J and 7K).

Treatment of erythroleukemia cell lines CB7
and HEL with A75, A89 and A228 compounds slightly
decrease the level of Fli-1 as measured by Western blots
(Figure 5F). This suggests that these compounds exert
their effect through a post-translational modification, as
previously seen with anti-Fli-1 compounds [23].
To address the consequences of Fli-1 activation,
expression of several Fli-1 target genes was determined
using RT-PCR and q-RT-PCR. Specifically, we examined
expression of megakaryocytic markers glycoprotein
VI (GP6) and platelet factor 4 (PF4), both known to be
positively regulated by Fli-1 [32–34]. As expected, mRNA
levels of PF4 and GP6 were significantly elevated in HEL
cells treated with TPA, A236 and A75 compounds (Figure
6A and 6B). Similar upregulation was detected after Fli-1
expression in CB7 cells (data not shown). In K562 cells
lacking Fli-1, expression of PF4 was slightly induced by
A75 and A236, but GP6 transcription downregulated by
these agents (Figure 7A and 7B). However, induction
of Fli-1 in K562-Fli-1 cells via DOX resulted in robust
upregulation of PF4 and GP6 transcripts (Figure 7G and
7H). This result and appearance of CD41+ K562 cells
induced by Fli-1 further support the role of this TF in

Figure 6: Fli-1 transactivating compounds alter expression of marker genes involved in erythroid to megakaryocytic

Together, these results demonstrate that the compounds
induce a switch from erythroid- to megakaryocytic-gene
expression program in erythroleukemia cells.
RUNX1 plays a crucial role in adult (definitive)
hematopoiesis [40]. It directly binds Fli-1 and other TFs to
regulate EMD [41]. In HEL cells, RUNX1 expression was
marginally changed in response to TPA, A236 and A75
compounds (Figure 6G), but significantly upregulated in
drug-treated K562 cells (Figure 7F). Expression of Fli-1 in
K562 cells moderately yet significantly reduced RUNX1
expression (Figure 7L). Thus, the compounds, but not Fli1 alone, regulate the expression of RUNX1.

MAPK phosphorylation in both HEL and CB7 cells
even after treating with these compounds (Figure 8B).
Growth inhibition induced by these compounds was also
diminished by GO6983 (Figure 8C). The MEK inhibitor
U0126 significantly inhibited CB7 cell growth, but only
marginally rescued growth suppression induced by A75
(Figure 8D). Finally, both U0126 and GO6983 treatment
significantly abolished the A75-mediated upregulation of
PF4 and downregulation of β-globin genes in HEL cells,
respectively (Figure 8E and 8F). These results demonstrate
a critical role of Fli-1 and its upstream regulators PKC
and MAPK/ERK in EMD. Thus, we designated our
compounds as PKC agonists (PKCAs). While GO6983
blocked cell attachment induced by A75 and TPA, the
MEK inhibitor did not (Figure 9). These results place
PKC upstream of the MEK/Fli-1 differentiation pathway
and suggest an additional role for PKC in cell attachment,
which is independent of Fli-1 (Figure 8G).
PKCAs strongly increased PKCδ phosphorylation
in HEL and CB7 cell lines (Figure 10A), but had no
effect on PKCα and nPKC-eta activities (data not shown).
Treatment with the specific PKCδ-inhibitor Rottlerin
[42, 43], reduced phosphorylation of both PKCδ and
MAPK/ERK (Figure 10B), and completely blocked Fli1 transactivation induced by Fli-1 or Fli-1+ indicated
compounds (Figure 10C). Treatment of HEL cells with

Tumor inhibition by Fli-1 transactivating
compounds is mediated through phosphorylation

TPA and other phorbol ester compounds activate
protein kinase C by mimicking diacyl glycerol (DAG),
its natural agonist [31]. Previous studies by our group
and others have demonstrated the importance of PKCγ
phosphorylation during Fli-1 transcriptional activation
[2, 23]. In accordance, using our luciferase assay, we
found that Fli-1 mediated transcriptional activation by
A75 and TPA could be inhibited by the PKC inhibitor
GO6983 (Figure 8A). This inhibitor completely blocked

Rottlerin, similar to U0126 (Figure 9), did not block cell
attachment, indicating involvement of other PKCs in
this process (Data not shown). Interestingly, the PKCAs
also increased phosphorylation of Fli-1 in HEL and CB7
cells, as detected using an anti-Serine/Threonine antibody
(Figure 10D). This is in accordance with our previous work
showing that Fli-1 inhibitors reduce this phosphorylation
[23]. Together, these results demonstrate the importance
of PKCδ in growth suppression downstream of our
compounds.

5E), A89 only weakly suppressed tumorigenesis in these
mice (Figure 11B). In contrast to the above drugs, A236
demonstrated some toxicity and was therefore excluded
from the in vivo analysis. Overall, our results demonstrate
that some of our PKCAs, such as A75, can be utilized for
the treatment of leukemia carrying an activated Fli-1.
We next sought to determine whether EMD
observed in vitro also occurred in vivo. Since
F-MuLV-induced leukemic cells mainly infiltrate the
spleens, resulting in splenomegaly [4], tumors with
similar volume were subjected to flow cytometry
analysis. A higher number of splenocytes expressing
megakaryocyte-specific markers CD41 and CD61 (59%58%) were detected in leukemic spleens of A75-treated
mice compared with DMSO-injected controls (12%17%) (Figure 11C and 11D). In contrast, no significant
change in the percentage of cells expressing the erythroid
marker CD71 was observed (Figure 11E). In this case,
leukemic cells that underwent EMC may also express
CD71 [45]. As the majority of splenic cells represent
erythroleukemia in these mice, the results suggest that
over-activation of Fli-1 or activation of the PKC-MAPKFli-1 axis by A75 suppress leukemogenesis at least in
part by inducing EMD.

PKCA compounds induce megakaryocytic
differentiation and suppress
erythroleukemia in vivo
To determine whether our PKCA compounds
can suppress leukemia progression in vivo, we used a
mouse model of erythroleukemias induced by F-MuLV,
in which insertional activation of Fli-1 occurs as early
as 40 days post viral injection [44], is the initial event
during leukemogenesis [4]. We found that treatment of
F-MuLV-infected mice with A75 significantly inhibited
erythroleukemia development (Figure 11A). Consistent
with its lower Fli-1 transcriptional activation (Figure

DISCUSSION

activation of Fli-1 appear to have therapeutic applications
for leukemia.
Since Fli-1 was originally identified as an oncogene
involved in erythroleukemogenesis, this raises the
question of how drug-mediated over-activation of this
proto-oncogene can reverse its function to become a
tumor suppressor. As shown here and in other studies,
Fli-1 expression is high in some erythroleukemia cell
lines (HEL, CB7), but negligible in others (K562, KH16)
[46]. While siRNA- or drug-mediated downregulation of
Fli-1 in erythroleukemic cells with high Fli-1 expression
induces erythroid differentiation [6], its activation by our
PKCA compounds or its re-expression in Fli-1-negative
cells specifically promotes megakaryocytic differentiation.
These results suggest that although a certain level of Fli-1
can be tolerated in a given erythroleukemic cell to sustain
proliferation, suppression of Fli-1 or further activation
of this TF can induce differentiation to erythroid or

The ETS gene Fli-1 is a critical regulator of
development and homeostasis. Over-expression of Fli-1
affects several hallmarks of cancer including proliferation,
differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and genomic
stability [2]. Based on these abilities, much effort has
been invested in the development of anti-Fli-1 drugs for
the treatment of cancers driven by this TF. In this study,
repurposing screens of compounds isolated from Chinese
medicinal plants led to the identification of a group of
compounds that induce Fli-1 transcriptional activity.
Unexpectedly we found that these compounds suppressed,
rather than induced, erythroleukemia both in vitro and
in vivo. We demonstrate that these compounds, through
regulation of several Fli-1 downstream target genes,
promote megakaryocytic differentiation of leukemic cells,
leading to growth inhibition. Thus, both inhibition and

to cessation of growth (Figure 11F). This Fli-1 mediated
restriction phenomenon is not limited to erythroleukemias
and may also apply to other cancer types. For example,
both high and low levels of Fli-1 were found to be
associated with poor survival of human acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML) [7]. In this case, Fli-1 inactivation in
high-expressing AML cells should have therapeutic benefit
as we showed for erythroleukemia [6, 23]. In low- and
high-expressing AMLs with poor prognosis, altering
Fli-1 threshold through forced expression could also
negatively impact leukemic growth, as we have shown
here for K562 and HEL cells, respectively. This restriction
phenomenon may also be relevant to other transcription
factors including E2F1: for instance, both up- and downregulation of E2F1 were reported to have a negative effect
on cell growth [47, 48].

Our results show that post-translational modification
of Fli-1 is responsible for PKCA-induced megakaryocytic
differentiation. PKCδ phosphorylation was critical for
Fli-1 transcriptional activation as its pharmacological
inhibition abolished growth inhibition and differentiation.
Fli-1 has been shown to interact with RUNX1, and TPA
reduces phosphorylation of serine-10 residue in Fli-1
that was found to be critical for this complex to promote
megakaryocytic differentiation [49]. The importance
of Fli-1 - RUNX1 interaction in megakaryocytic
differentiation is also supported by the identification
of inactivating mutations in both TFs in patients with
excessive bleeding [50]. How these two TFs function
and whether PKC is involved in this process are yet
to be determined. However, we did show here that
megakaryocytic specific gene expression can be induced
following Fli-1 transduction in erythroleukemia cells, and

can be further elevated by treatment with PKCAs. Based
on these observations, we propose that Fli-1 expression is
necessary for erythroleukemic cells to di-differentiate into
cells resembling megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors
(MEP) [Vecchiarelli-Federico et al, unpublished results].
Subsequent events induced by the PKCA compounds,
including Serine/Threonine phosphorylation of Fli-1
may accelerate differentiation of these MEPs toward
megakaryocytes - a process we termed erythroid-tomegakaryocytic conversion (EMC).
Protein-protein interaction between Fli-1 and GATA1 was recognized as a critical event during megakaryocytic
differentiation [41, 51]. Indeed, at low concentrations of
PKCAs downregulated GATA1, at higher concentration
they significantly upregulated GATA1 expression in
erythroleukemia cell lines expressing Fli-1. However,
these compounds drastically downregulated GATA1 in Fli1-non-expressing K562 cells. Expression of Fli-1 in K562
was shown to moderate this downregulation, highlighting
the importance of GATA1 expression in megakaryocytic

differentiation. This finding is consistent with the
formation of a heptad including five key hematopoietic
transcription factors: FLI-1, GATA1, GATA2, RUNX1
and TAL1/SCL during megakaryopoiesis [41, 51]. Our
data suggest that Fli-1 is a major player in this complex
interaction and that its downregulation or activation below
or above certain thresholds can alter the fate of progenitor
cells to undergo either erythroid or to megakaryocytic
differentiation, respectively (see model, Figure 11F).
We show that transcriptional activation of Fli-1
by the PKCAs is induced by MAPK/ERK activation
(Figure 8G). However, inhibition of MAPK/ERK with
a specific inhibitor only had a marginal effect on growth
repression induced by these compounds, implicating
other pathways induced by PKC or by these drugs.
Indeed, the cell attachment induced by the PKCA
compounds was mediated by PKC independently of
MAPK/ERK. In addition, in Fli-1 negative K562 cells,
the PKCA compounds induced apoptosis in the absence
of differentiation. Thus, induction of apoptosis by these

F. A model for PKCA drug-induced erythroid-to-megakaryocytic differentiation in erythroleukemia. In HEL cells, Fli-1 downregulation
(Fli-1 down) through either siRNA [6] or pharmacological drugs [23] leads to erythroid differentiation. Conversely, Fli-1 activation by
these compounds promotes megakaryocytic differentiation. In K562 cells which express no Fli1, Fli-1 transduction (Fli-1 up) also induces
megakaryocytic differentiation. This model suggests that both Fli-1 inactivation and activation suppress leukemia either through erythroid
or megakaryocytic differentiation, respectively. E - erythrocytes; MK - megakaryocytes.

compounds may be mediated by an alternative pathway or
another member of the PKC family.
The PKCA compounds exhibited potent inhibitory
potential when administered into a mouse model of
leukemia. The level of tumor inhibition in vivo correlated
with the ability of the drug to activate PKC in vitro. This
anti-leukemic activity was associated with EMD in the
spleens of leukemic mice. Thus, paradoxically, activation
of PKC, despite unambiguous tumor promoting function
in certain contexts, can be beneficial for the treatment
of Fli-1-induced leukemia. Importantly, inactivating
mutations in PKC occur frequently in diverse cancer types
and correction of these mutations by CRISPR-mediated
genome editing can block tumor progression [52]. Thus,
PKC isozymes may function as tumor suppressors in
certain other contexts as described herein.
In summary, by screening a library of compounds
from natural products, we identified several phorbol
ester-like agents with strong anti-leukemic activity.
These compounds were shown to exert their antileukemic activity in part through activation of Fli-1.
Mechanistically, they modulate Fli-1 by activating PKC
and MAPK, leading to phosphorylation and activation
of this TF. The PKCA-mediated activations of Fli-1
was shown to induce an erythroid-to-megakaryocytic
differentiation (EMD) in cultured cells and in a leukemic
model in vivo and suppress tumorigenesis. Overall, these
data suggest that both activation and inactivation of Fli-1
may have therapeutic benefit for the treatment of leukemia
and likely other type of cancers expressing this ETS
member.

Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A library of 1500 compounds, isolated from
medicinal plants in China, was used to screen for antiFli-1 activity, as previously described [23]. In brief,
HEK293T cells were co-transfected with FB-Luc (1.25μg)
and MigR1 (1.25μg) or MigR1-Fli-1 (1.25μg) expression
vector for 24 hours using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technology, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. The transfected cells were plated into 96 well
plates, incubated for 12 hours and then treated with
compounds (5μM) or other indicated compounds for
additional 12 hours. Luciferase activity was determined,
as described [23, 54].

For apoptosis and cell cycle analysis,
erythroleukemia cell lines were incubated with compounds
or DMSO as a vehicle control for 72 hours; after that cells
were washed by cold PBS. For apoptosis experiment, cells
were stained by Annexin V and PI apoptosis detection Kit
(BD Biosciences, Franklin lakes, NJ) following the kit
guidelines and analysed by flow cytometer. For cell cycle
analysis, cells were fixed by cold 75% ethanol overnight
at -20°C. After washed by cold PBS, cells were stained in
PI for 40 mins at 37°C, then analysed by flow cytometer.

Flow cytometric analysis
Immunofluorescence staining was performed to
determine expression of various molecules on the cell
lines, tumors cells of drug-treated and control (DMSO–
treated) mice, as described [53]. In brief, 106 cells were
incubated with CD16/CD32 blocking antibody or human
Fc receptor binding inhibitor (eBioscience, San Diego,
CA) for 20 min, then stained with primary antibodies
for 1h on ice. Primary antibodies were as follows:
Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti–mouse or anti-human
CD41, CD61 and Allophycocyanin-conjugated antimouse CD71 (eBioscience). Then cells were washed
and resuspended in 500 μL of PBS Phosphate Buffered
Saline. A total of 104 events were collected using the
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and
analysed using CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences).

Drug screening and luciferase assay

Cell lines
Murine Friend virus-induced erythroleukemic cell
lines CB7, human erythroleukemic cell lines K562 and
HEL, human embryonic kidney HEK293T cell lines
were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, GE
Healthcare, Australia).

Tumor induction and in vivo drug studies
Viral supernatants from NIH-3T3 cells transduced
with F-MuLV clone 57 plasmid were harvested and
frozen at -80°C. New born mice were inoculated by
intraperitoneal F-MuLV injections, as described [23].
Five weeks post infection, leukemic mice were injected
IP, every other day for a total of six injections with
A75 and A89 compounds [3 mg / kg of bodyweight] or
DMSO as vehicle control, and monitored for signs of
disease. Mice showing the signs of late stage disease
were sacrificed and survival was determined, as
described [23].

Western blotting, immunoprecipitation and
inhibitory compounds
Western blotting was conducted as described [23].
Polyclonal rabbit antibody for Fli-1, PKCδ, PhosphoPKCδ, PKCα, Phospho-PKCα were obtained from
Abcam (Abcam, Cambridge, UK); ERK, phospho-ERK
and GATA1 antibodies from Cell Signalling Technology
(CST, Danvers, MA01923), GAPDH from Sigma (Sigma
Aldrich, China) and β-actin from Proto-Technology
(Protein-Tech, Bucuresti, Romania). The dilution of

antibodies was used according to the manufacturer
instructions. The inhibitors of PKC (GO6983), MEK
(U0126), RAF (Sorafenib Tosylate), JNK (SB600125),
Calcimycin, Rottlerin, and P38 (SB203580) were all
obtained from Sellectchem (Sellectchem, Houston, USA).
These compounds were dissolved in DMSO and added
to the cells at indicated concentration, as described in the
results section.
For immunoprecipitation, Extracts isolated from
HEL and CB7 cells were immunoprecipitated using antiFli-1 antibody followed by western blot with anti-phospho
Serine/Threonine antibody (Abcam), as previously
described [23].

PMD2.D (a gift from Didier Trono, Addgene plasmid #
12259 and 12260) were co-transfected into HEK293T
cells, as described [55]. 48 hours post transfection, the
supernatants were harvested, the viruses were centrifuged
at 2500 x g for 10 min, and filtered through 0.45 μm filters.
The viruses were either used for infection freshly, or
stored at -80°C freezer. For leukemic cells infection, K562
cells were cultured and grown in the presence of fresh
supernatant of lentivirus producing cells. After 24 hours
infection, medium was changed and cells were grown in
presence of Neomycin (Solanbio, Beijing, China), until
G418 -resistant cells were obtained.
