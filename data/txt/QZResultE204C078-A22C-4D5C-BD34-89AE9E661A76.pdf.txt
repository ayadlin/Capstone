Abstract
Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis and limited response to chemotherapy. Hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) and its receptor cMET augment cancer growth and
resistance to chemotherapy, but their role in adrenocortical carcinoma has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the
association between HGF/cMET expression and cancer hallmarks of
adrenocortical carcinoma. Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that increased HGF/cMET expression in
human adrenocortical carcinoma samples was positively associated
with cancer-related biologic processes, including proliferation and
angiogenesis, and negatively correlated with apoptosis. Accordingly,
treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma cells with exogenous HGF

resulted in increased cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo while short
hairpin RNA–mediated knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of
cMET suppressed cell proliferation and tumor growth. Moreover,
exposure of cells to mitotane, cisplatin, or radiation rapidly induced
pro-cMET expression and was associated with an enrichment of
genes (e.g., CYP450 family) related to therapy resistance, further
implicating cMET in the anticancer drug response. Together, these
data suggest an important role for HGF/cMET signaling in adrenocortical carcinoma growth and resistance to commonly used treatments. Targeting cMET, alone or in combination with other drugs,
could provide a breakthrough in the management of this aggressive
cancer. Cancer Res; 75(19); 4131–42. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

poor prognosis with an estimated recurrence rate of 60% to 70%
after resection of tumors conﬁned to the adrenal gland and the 5year survival rate for patients presenting with stage IV disease of
about 15% (1–3). While surgery remains the best option for
adrenocortical carcinoma patients presenting with localized disease, surgical resection is often not feasible in patients with
advanced/recurrent disease, and systemic chemotherapy is often
used. The response rate with the current ﬁrst-line chemotherapy
regimen (etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin with mitotane) is
only 23%, and median time to disease progression is about 6
months (4). Unfortunately, there are no approved second-line
regimens, and patients are often referred to clinical trials using
agents or regimens with unproven efﬁcacy after failing ﬁrst-line
treatment. Similarly, adrenocortical carcinoma has limited
response to external beam radiation, and radiotherapy is mostly
used as a palliative measure (5, 6). Thus, there is an urgent need to
identify clinically actionable molecular pathways driving adrenocortical carcinoma tumorigenesis and tumor progression.
To develop more effective and less toxic treatments for adrenocortical carcinoma, much of the research over the past two
decades has focused on understanding the molecular pathways
involved in adrenocortical carcinoma. It is well accepted that
insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) is overexpressed in most cases
of adrenocortical carcinoma. IGF2 promotes tumor cell growth
through IGF1 receptor–mediated downstream activation of the
protein kinase B (AKT)/mTOR pathway, but does not seem to be
the major driver of adrenocortical carcinogenesis (7). Clinical
studies using inhibitors of IGF1R/mTOR signaling have revealed

Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare endocrine malignancy that
originates in the adrenal cortex. Adrenocortical carcinoma has

minimal tumor responses (8). We hypothesized that other regulatory pathways are simultaneously active in adrenocortical
carcinoma, leading to invasive behavior and treatment resistance.
cMET has been reported to be expressed in normal adrenal tissue
(9), and the cMET signaling pathway (Fig. 1A), which is activated
through binding to HGF, is critical in tumor progression/invasiveness and therapy resistance in multiple malignancies (10–13).
However, the roles of HGF and cMET in adrenocortical carcinoma
have not been evaluated. We therefore examined the potential
contribution of the HGF/cMET pathway to cancer hallmarks in
adrenocortical carcinoma as an essential step toward exploration
of the utility of drugs targeting this pathway.

Materials and Methods
External adrenocortical carcinoma databases
Transcriptomic proﬁles of adrenocortical carcinoma datasets
GSE10927 and GSE49278 were downloaded from the Gene
Expression Omnibus databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/query/acc.cgi?acc¼GSE10927;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc¼GSE49278). The GSE10927 dataset
included 10 normal adrenal cortex samples, 22 adrenocortical
adenoma samples, and 33 adrenocortical carcinoma samples
(14), and the GSE49278 dataset included 44 adrenocortical
carcinoma samples (15). The downloaded GSE10927 raw data
from Affymetrix HG U133 plus 2 arrays (with 54,675 probes) and
the GSE49278 raw data from Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST
arrays (with 53,617 probes) were analyzed using Nexus Expression 3.0 software (BioDiscovery) and gene set enrichment analysis

expression quartiles. The widths of the links and the relationship
of the biologic processes to cancer hallmarks were determined
using Z scores and illustrated in a Circos plot (16, 17). Genes from
the GSE10927 dataset with signiﬁcant changes in expression
relative to that in noncancerous adrenocortical tissue (P 
0.01, absolute value of log ratio >0.1, pool size for intensitybased pooling 100,000) are presented as heatmaps (Supplementary Fig. S1) and are listed in Supplementary Table S3.
Patient tissue samples
Adrenocortical tissue samples were collected from available
specimens in our pathology department and analyzed according
to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston,
TX). We measured serum HGF in 22 adrenocortical carcinoma
patients and 7 healthy controls (Supplementary Table S1). Two
tissue microarrays were constructed from core samples in duplicates and prepared by the Biospecimens Core Facility at MD
Anderson Cancer Center. The ﬁrst tissue microarray (TMA) contained duplicate cores from 13 adrenocortical carcinoma patients
and 7 adrenal adenoma samples. The second TMA included 55
evaluable adrenocortical carcinoma cores (from 28 chemotherapy na€ve adrenocortical carcinoma patients and constructed as
duplicate cores from each subject) and 15 adrenal adenoma
samples (from 15 patients with adrenal adenomas that were
constructed as single cores from each patient to serve as control;
Supplementary Table S2). Tissues and serum samples were collected and frozen prospectively, after we had obtained patients'
written informed consent to participate in our research according
to a protocol approved by our IRB, or were obtained retrospectively from our institutional tissue bank. A waiver of the

requirement for informed consent was granted by the IRB for
inclusion of specimens that were retrospectively obtained. In all
cases, the diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma was conﬁrmed by
board-certiﬁed pathologists based on Weiss scores 3 (18).
Cell lines and reagents
The NCI-H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cell
line was obtained from the ATCC (catalog no. CRL-2128).
NCI-H295R cells were grown in DMEM–Ham F12 medium
supplemented with 5% Nu-Serum I (BD Biosciences), ITS (BD
Biosciences; 0.00625 mg/mL insulin, 0.00625 mg/mL transferrin, 6.25 ng/mL selenium, 1.25 mg/mL bovine serum albumin
and 0.00535 mg/mL linoleic acid), and antibiotic–antimycotic
solution (Corning Cellgro; 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL
streptomycin, and 250 ng/mL amphotericin B). Cell viability
was measured using the MTT assay, as described previously
(19). The total number of live cells was determined by multiplying the number of cells counted with a Coulter counter by
the percentage of live cells in the cell population as determined
by Trypan blue dye exclusion. For radiation experiments,
H295R cells were irradiated at room temperature with a Mark
I 137Cs irradiator (JL Shepherd & Associates) at a dose rate of
3.5 Gy/minute (8Gy). Protein lysates were collected at different
time points after irradiation (1, 3, 6, 12, and 30 hours). Protein
level of cMET and phospho-cMET was evaluated by Western
blot analysis.
Immunohistochemical analysis
Tissue microarray slides were then stained with antibodies
against cMET (Cell Signaling Technology #8198; 1:200 dilution),
anti-cMET phosphorylated at Y1234/1235 (Cell Signaling Technology #3077; 1:150 dilution), and anti-HGF antibodies (Abgent
#AP1724b; 1:100 dilution) according to a standard immunohistochemistry protocol. Slides were also stained for markers of cell
proliferation (Ki-67), tumor vascularity (CD34), and apoptosis
(cleaved caspase-3) at the core laboratory of the MD Anderson
Department of Pathology. After staining, the IHC slides were
analyzed and quantiﬁed objectively using an ACIS III Image
Analysis System (Dako Corporation). The intensity of immunohistochemical (IHC) staining within tumor areas was determined
by the ACIS III Image Analysis System. IHC staining intensity
values were used for statistical analyses and graph preparation.
IHC staining was additionally analyzed by pathologists at MD
Anderson Cancer Center. Representative photomicrographs were
obtained using Dako ACIS and Olympus microscopes.
Serum HGF measurement
Patients' serum samples were obtained by centrifuging blood
samples at 900  g for 15 minutes at 4 C. Human HGF levels were
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to
the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma-Aldrich).
Protein analysis
All protein analyses were performed using lysates from wholecell pellets or human tumor samples in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, as previously described (19). Protein level of
cMET and phospho-cMET was evaluated by Western blot analysis.
Protein level of phospho-STAT3, phospho-ATF2, and phosphocJUN was evaluated by ELISA-based xMAP multiplex immunoanalysis as described by the manufacturer (EMD Millipore). Antibodies against cMET and phospho-cMET (Y1234/1235) were

obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Secondary antibodies
goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution in 1 TBST solution
containing 3% BSA) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution
in 1 TBST solution containing 3% BSA) were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich.
RNA analysis
Total RNA was isolated from treated cells using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen Life Technologies) by following the manufacturer's
protocol, as previously described (19). The Qiagen RNeasy Mini
Kit was used to increase RNA purity and remove residual genomic
DNA. Single-stranded complementary DNA from RNA samples
(1 mg of total RNA) was generated using the iScript cDNA synthesis
kit (Bio-Rad). Relative gene expression was determined by realtime quantitative PCR using an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus
Real-Time PCR system (Invitrogen) and iQ SYBR Green Supermix
reagents (Bio-Rad). The sequences of the primers used for the
relative gene expression analysis of MET (long isoform a, accession number NM_001127500) were 50 caggcagtgcagcatgtagt 30
(forward) and 50 gatgattccctcggtcagaa 30 (reverse). The expression
level of the b-actin housekeeping gene, ACTB, was used as the
internal control and analyzed in each experiment for normalization. The sequences of the primers used for ACTB (accession
number NM_001101.3) were 50 ggacttcgagcaagagatgg 30 (forward) and 50 agcactgtgttggcgtacag 30 (reverse). Relative changes
were calculated using the DDCt formula.
Animal models
For xenografting in vivo experiments, we generated H295RcMET-KD cells with decreased cMET expression by lentiviral
infection with cMET shRNA. As control cells, we generated
H295R-GFP-KD cells by lentiviral infection with GFP shRNA.
H295R-cMET-KD or H295R-GFP-KD cells (4  106 cells) in
100 mL with 50% Reduce Growth Hormone Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected into the right ﬂank of male Nu/Nu mice
(n ¼ 5 mice per group). XL-184 (cabozantinib, a small-molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and cMET), which is
property to the NCI Collaborator Exelixis, Inc., was provided
through the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. For in vivo
experiments with cabozantinib, NCI-H295R cells (6  106 cells)
in 100 mL with 50% Reduce Growth Hormone Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) were injected into the right ﬂank of male Nu/Nu
mice. After one to two weeks of cells inoculation, when the tumors
reached 5 mm in diameter, xenografted mice were randomized
into cabozantinib treatment (30 mg/kg/d; ref. 20) and placebo
groups (n ¼ 6 mice per group). The selected dose of cabozantinib
experiments is in line with similar published data in mouse
experiments (20). Tumor growth was measured by means of
tumor volume. Measurements of tumor volume were taken every
week or two weeks, and volumes were estimated with this formula: length  width2/2. All animal experiments were conducted
in accordance with American Association for Laboratory Animal
Science regulations and the approval of The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Statistical analysis
Statistical differences were assessed with Student t-test or the
Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. For experiments involving
more than two groups, we used the one-way analysis of variance;

Results
High expression and activation of HGF/cMET signaling in
adrenocortical carcinoma patients
Our analysis of transcriptomic proﬁles of an adrenocortical
carcinoma patient cohort (dataset GSE10927, National Center
for Biotechnology Information; ref. 14) revealed signiﬁcant
upregulation of MET mRNA in adrenocortical carcinoma samples compared with adrenal adenoma and normal adrenocortical tissue samples (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary
Table S3). This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed using real-time PCR
analysis of an independent set of adrenocortical carcinoma
and adrenal adenoma samples obtained at our institute following IRB approval (Supplementary Fig. S2). Immunohistochemical analysis of two independent tissue microarrays and
Western blot analysis results further demonstrated a signiﬁcant
adrenocortical carcinoma-speciﬁc elevations of HGF and total
cMET protein levels, and activation of cMET signaling, as seen
by phosphorylation at the Y1234/1235 sites (Figs. 1 and 2 and
Supplementary Fig. S3). The mean concentration of serum HGF
in adrenocortical carcinoma patients was 365 pg/mL that is 2.1fold (P ¼ 0.0002) higher than that in control subjects (Fig. 1E;
Supplementary Table S1). We were also able to detect HGF in
the culture medium of human adrenocortical carcinoma cell
line NCI-H295R at a concentration of 497.2 pg/mL. This
suggests a potential autocrine loop in adrenocortical carcinoma. The HGF/cMET pathway interacts in complex ways with
other important signaling pathways. HGF is known to stimulate tumor angiogenesis by increasing the production of angiogenic cytokines and by direct cMET activation, enhancing
endothelial cell proliferation and motility (21, 22).

cMET is associated with enhancement of cancer hallmarks in
adrenocortical carcinoma
Functional genomic analysis identiﬁed 63 biologic processes
that were signiﬁcantly different (P < 0.05) between the high and
low MET expression adrenocortical carcinoma patients (Supplementary Table S4). These data provide evidence that MET expression is associated with biologic processes related to cancer hallmarks in adrenocortical carcinoma, as visualized in a Circos plot
(Fig. 3A; refs. 16, 17). Biologic processes related to sustained
proliferation, increased tumor metabolism, resistance to cell
death, chemotherapy resistance, and activation of metastasis were
among the cancer hallmarks most enhanced in adrenocortical
carcinoma associated with the high MET phenotype. Bioinformatics analysis revealed marked overexpression of oncogenes
while downregulation of tumor suppressor genes in association
with high expression of MET (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S5).
Gene set enrichment analysis (23) of transcriptomic proﬁles of
two independent adrenocortical carcinoma patient cohorts
(GSE10927 and GSE49278; refs. 14, 15) showed that high MET
expression was associated with a collective upregulation of genes
involved in cell proliferation, as well as genes involved in negative
regulation of apoptosis (Fig. 4; Supplementary Tables S6–S9).
Increased HGF/cMET signaling is associated with enhanced
proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor growth, and reduced
apoptosis in adrenocortical carcinoma
To validate the signiﬁcance of HGF/cMET activation in adrenocortical carcinoma, we evaluated the correlation between
HGF/cMET activation and proliferation, promotion of angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Tumor tissue microarray sections (55
adrenocortical carcinoma scores from 28 therapy-na€ve patients
and 15 adenoma cores from 15 individual patients) stained for
HGF, cMET, and phosphorylated cMET antibodies were positively correlated with cell proliferation marker (Ki-67) and
tumor vascularity (CD34 staining; Fig. 5 and Supplementary
Fig. S4) and negatively correlated with apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 staining; Supplementary Fig. S4). To evaluate HGF's effect
on adrenocortical carcinoma growth and viability, we added
recombinant human HGF into the culture medium of NCI-

found that cisplatin and mitotane (two key components of ﬁrstline chemotherapy for advanced adrenocortical carcinoma), and
radiation treatment induce cMET expression in NCI-H295R cells,
as manifested by a rise in pro-cMET (Fig. 6A–C). Further bioinformatics analysis demonstrated overexpression of genes related

patients with high MET expression.
To further investigate the functional role of cMET in adrenocortical carcinoma cell biology, we generated a NCI-H295R
adrenocortical carcinoma cell line with decreased cMET expression by knockdown using cMET-targeted shRNA (H295RcMET-KD). Knockdown of cMET mRNA signiﬁcantly decreased
in vitro cell proliferation (Fig. 7B) and induced cell-cycle arrest
(Fig. 7C and D). To further validate the role of cMET signaling
in adrenocortical carcinoma tumor growth and progression,
we established an adrenocortical carcinoma in vivo xenograft
mouse model using H295R-cMET-KD cells. Our results conﬁrmed that cMET knockdown signiﬁcantly decreased (P <
0.05) tumor growth (Fig. 7E and F). Moreover, in vivo inhibition of cMET by cabozantinib (a commercially available smallmolecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity toward
cMET; ref. 29) signiﬁcantly (P < 0.001) reduced tumor growth
(Fig. 7G and H). Our results also show that stable knockdown
of cMET mRNA signiﬁcantly reduced both mitochondrial
respiration and glycolytic metabolism (Supplementary Fig.
S6). Thus, adrenocortical carcinoma tumor growth is dependent, at least in part, on cMET signaling, and cMET inhibition

4136 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

is likely to have a role in treatment of advanced adrenocortical
carcinoma.

Discussion
We found that HGF/cMET are expressed at a higher level in
adrenocortical carcinoma than in adrenal adenomas and normal
cortex. Moreover, activation of HGF/cMET appears to enhance
adrenocortical carcinoma growth, tumor-related angiogenesis,
chemotherapy resistance, and cell survival. Therefore, our data
suggest that cMET may be a valuable therapeutic target for
adrenocortical carcinoma.
The ﬁeld of adrenal neoplasia has achieved important milestones during the past 25 years, including the discovery of major
genetic alterations and molecularly characterizing adrenal cortical
cancer genomic proﬁles (15, 30). However, adrenocortical carcinoma is considered an aggressive malignancy with limited
response to chemotherapy (1, 4–6, 31, 32). Therefore, deciphering the mechanisms driving adrenal cortical tumorigenesis as well
as identifying the vulnerabilities of this aggressive type of cancer
remains a challenge in this ﬁeld (15, 30, 33). Most adrenocortical
carcinomas show IGF2 overexpression with the possible role of

HGF/cMET Pathway and Adrenocortical Carcinoma

Increased HGF/cMET signaling is associated with enhanced proliferation and angiogenesis in tumors from adrenocortical carcinoma patients. A,

the AKT/mTOR pathway as a downstream effect promoting tumor
cell growth, but with minimal effect in adrenocortical carcinogenesis (7). Clinical studies to determine the effect of blocking
mTOR signaling have revealed minimal tumor responses (8). We
hypothesized that other signaling pathways are simultaneously
active in adrenocortical carcinoma, leading to invasiveness and
treatment resistance. HGF activates cMET in an autocrine and
paracrine fashion, leading to enhanced cancer cell proliferation
and metastatic potential and associated with poor prognosis in a
variety of malignancies (10–12, 24–27). For the ﬁrst time, we
report that the expression of HGF/cMET is high in adrenocortical
carcinoma and that cMET activation is associated with adrenocortical carcinoma growth. These data raise the possibility that
cMET is a potential therapeutic target for adrenocortical carcinoma. In addition, the activation of HGF/cMET pathway was associated with increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis
based on our immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue microarray. We also found that HGF promotes H295R cell growth in
vitro. In other cancer models, HGF secretion was reported to be

produced by tumor-derived ﬁbroblasts and to have a paracrine
role in stimulating tumor growth (28).
Serum HGF is elevated in different malignancies; it has prognostic value, is correlated with disease burden, and can be used to
identify responders to systemic therapy in a variety of solid and
hematologic malignancies (34–38). However, circulating HGF
can be nonspeciﬁc and transiently elevated in other non-neoplastic disease processes (39–41). We identiﬁed HGF-induced cell
growth in the H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cell line. A complex interaction exists between HGF/cMET pathway and other
important signaling pathways. HGF stimulates tumor angiogenesis via enhancing endothelial cell proliferation and motility.
These proangiogenic effects are mediated by increasing the production of angiogenic cytokines, such as VEGF and IL8, and by
direct cMET activation (21, 22).
The molecular mechanisms responsible for cMET and HGF
overexpression in adrenocortical carcinoma remain unclear and
warrant investigation. Somatic mutations of MET are rare in
adrenocortical carcinoma (42); however, the genome area

cMET expression is correlated with increased gene expression of enzymes involved in drug metabolism in adrenocortical carcinoma. A, NCI-H295R cells were

where MET is located is commonly ampliﬁed in adrenocortical
carcinoma (15). We found somatic MET alteration in only one
out of 14 adrenocortical carcinoma specimens and this opens
the door for other mechanisms to be responsible for cMET
activation such as gene ampliﬁcation as reported in other solid
malignancies (43). The adrenocortical carcinoma genomic
atlas (adrenocortical carcinoma TCGA) data shows genomic
ampliﬁcation on MET in adrenocortical carcinoma patients
compared with normal adrenal cortex. Thus, both MET ampliﬁcation and transcriptional induction after exposure to radiation or chemotherapy are likely responsible for cMET
overexpression.
In this study, we have identiﬁed activation of HGF/cMET
signaling pathway as a driver of adrenocortical carcinoma tumorigenesis and at the same time a potential Achilles' heel of this
malignancy. In fact, by combining multiple functional omics
screenings with tissue microarray analysis, in vitro assays, animal
modeling, and pharmaceutical intervention, we demonstrated for

4138 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

the ﬁrst time that HGF/cMET signaling pathway played a central
role in adrenocortical carcinoma tumorigenesis, discovering a
previously unknown therapeutic opportunity for clinical management of this aggressive malignancy. Therefore, emerging cMET
inhibitors hold promise as a potential breakthrough in adrenocortical carcinoma treatment.
Moreover, the ﬁndings that adrenocortical carcinoma cells
rapidly upregulated cMET expression as an emergency response
to radiation and chemotherapy, and that MET upregulation was
associated with enrichment of major genes responsible for anticancer therapy resistance, survival, and drug metabolism, could be
of signiﬁcant interest for the ﬁeld of cancer therapy innovation. In
fact, these ﬁndings may establish a scientiﬁc foundation for using
cMET inhibitors to overcome drug resistance in adrenocortical
carcinoma, which is currently a major challenge in adrenocortical
carcinoma treatment (1, 4, 31, 32). Besides, whether the fast
increase in MET expression after anticancer treatments is a particular feature of adrenocortical carcinoma cells or a common

phenomenon across many types of cancers remain to be explored.
In addition, how adrenocortical carcinoma cells induce MET
expression after anticancer therapies and what is the mechanism
for crosstalk between MET and CYP450 family are interesting
questions that warrant further study. We think that a complete
understanding about the contribution of HGF/cMET signaling in
adrenocortical carcinoma could perhaps establish activation of
HGF/cMET pathway as a predictive marker for tumor progression
and response to therapies, which may better stratiﬁcation of
adrenocortical carcinoma patients, optimize treatment plans, and
ameliorate therapeutic outcomes.
In addition, despite remarkable progress in the ﬁeld of
adrenocortical carcinoma, the process and mechanisms of
adrenocortical carcinoma evolution still remain largely unclear
(30, 33, 44–47). It is also undetermined whether adrenocortical
carcinoma evolutionary process originates from adrenal adenoma (30, 45, 47). There are several evidences supporting the
adenoma–carcinoma sequential tumorigenesis but more direct
proofs are needed to elucidate this mysterious evolution. Two
studies performed by Bernard and colleagues and Trezzi and
colleagues found the presence of malignant components within
adrenal adenomas in occasional cases (44, 45). Moreover,
Heaton and colleagues has recently developed a mouse model
with enhanced IGF2 expression and increased b-catenin stability to temporarily promote adrenal cortical hyperplasia progression to the formation of adenomas and seldom carcinomas
(46). In addition, high-resolution genomic analyses performed
by Ronchi and colleagues pointed out several common molecular genetic signatures and some shared signaling transduction
pathways (i.e., Notch and Wnt/b-catenin pathways) in adrenal
adenomas and carcinomas (33), which suggests a possibly
common origin. In our study, we observed a seemingly gradual
increase in HGF/cMET pathway upregulation and activation
from normal adrenal cortex to adrenal adenoma and then
carcinoma. Furthermore, when the HGF/cMET pathway is
highly activated in adrenocortical carcinoma, their whole gene
expression landscapes are reprogrammed toward promoting
cancer hallmarks deregulation, accelerating tumorigenesis,
enabling drug resistance while inhibiting tumor-suppressing
activities. These ﬁndings suggest that HGF/cMET signaling
activation could be a landmark in the evolutionary process
and tumorigenesis sequence of adrenal cortical carcinoma.
The relatively small number of studied specimens in our
report is a common shortcoming in studies seeking to ﬁnd new
signaling pathways in adrenocortical carcinoma, but highlights
the need for collaborative work to establish the prognostic
value of serum HGF as well as adrenocortical carcinoma cMET
expression (48–50). The paucity of adrenocortical carcinoma
cell lines is another limitation in adrenocortical carcinoma
research. However, we share the view of other groups that the
H295R cell line is the closest model to corticosteroid-producing
adrenocortical carcinoma (51). Considering the heterogeneity
of adrenocortical carcinoma, there is a need to validate our
ﬁndings in a large cohort of patients via a multi-institutional
collaboration, and to incorporate HGF measurements in future
prospective studies to assess its role as a prognostic marker in
adrenocortical carcinoma. Future work is also necessary to
clarify the effect of cMET signaling on adrenocortical carcinoma
resistance to currently used chemotherapy strategies in adrenocortical carcinoma as well as exploring the effect of HGF/
cMET inhibition on adrenocortical carcinoma and determining

4140 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

the mechanisms involved in cMET upregulation in adrenocortical carcinoma. A better understanding of this relationship
may provide a rationale for combination therapy.
In summary, we found that HGF/cMET are expressed at a
higher level in adrenocortical carcinoma than in adrenal adenomas and normal cortex. We have also shown that adrenocortical carcinoma cells produce HGF, leading to positive
autocrine feedback, which promotes adrenocortical carcinoma
cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, activation of HGF/
cMET appears to enhance adrenocortical carcinoma proliferation/growth, tumor-related angiogenesis, chemotherapy resistance, and cell survival. Furthermore, commonly used chemotherapeutic agents and radiation increased cMET expression in
vitro and cMET inhibition reduced adrenocortical carcinoma
growth in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our data suggest that cMET
may be a valuable therapeutic target for adrenocortical carcinoma, and further investigation of combinations of new cMET
inhibitors alone or in combination with current therapies may
lead to clinical breakthroughs in management of this disease.
This study provides preliminary data about HGF/cMET activation as a possible predictive marker for adrenocortical carcinoma progression and response to therapies, which may improve
stratiﬁcation of adrenocortical carcinoma patients and clinical
outcomes.
