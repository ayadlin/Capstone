Abstract
Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) play important roles in
development, angiogenesis, and cancer. FGF19 uniquely binds
to FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4). Our previous study has shown that
FGF19 transgenic tumors have an activated Wnt-pathway
phenotype. Wnt signaling is implicated in initiating or
promoting FGF signaling in various cell types and organs. In
this study, we examined whether FGF19 or inhibition of FGF19
affects the B-catenin signaling pathway using human colon
cancer cell lines (HCT116, Colo201). Our results show that
FGF19 increases tyrosine phosphorylation of B-catenin and
causes loss of B-catenin–E-cadherin binding. FGF19 increases
p-GSK3B and active B-catenin levels and anti-FGF19 antibody
(1A6) treatment abrogates this effect of FGF19. Anti-FGF19
antibody treatment increases S33/S37/T41 phosphorylation
and ubiquitination of B-catenin. Ion-trap mass spectrometric
analysis confirmed that 1A6 increases phosphorylation of
B-catenin in the NH2 terminus. Using HCT116-paired B-catenin
knockout cells, we show that FGF19 induces TCF/LEF reporter
activity in parental (WT/#45) and in WT/ but not in mutant
(/#45) cells, and that inhibition of endogenous FGF19
reduces this reporter activity, indicating that wild-type Bcatenin is accessible for modulation. FGFR4 knockdown using
inducible short hairpin RNA significantly reduces the colonyforming ability in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Although
cleaved caspase-3 immunoreactivity remains unchanged,
the number of ki67-positive nuclei is reduced in FGFR4
knockdown tumor xenograft tissues. Consistent with the
reduced B-catenin activation, Taqman analyses show that
FGF19/FGFR4 inhibition reduced B-catenin target gene (cyclin
D1, CD44, c-jun, Cox-2, UPAR) expression. These findings
highlight that FGF19/FGFR4 cross-talk with B-catenin and that
pathway intervention reduces tumor growth. [Cancer Res 2008;
68(13):5086–95]

Introduction
The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of signaling molecules
plays important roles in development, angiogenesis, and cancer (1).
FGF19 binds uniquely to FGFR4 (2). Our previous studies showed
that ectopic expression of FGF19 in transgenic mice results in
development of hepatocellular carcinomas by 10 months of age
and that liver tumors of these transgenic mice have neoplastic cells
that show nuclear localization of h-catenin indicative of activation
(3). Interestingly, recombination hotspots associated with carcino-

genesis include Wnt or FGF gene clusters. More recent studies have
shown that Wnt and FGF signaling cross-talk during a variety of
cellular processes, including human colorectal carcinogenesis, and
that coactivation of Wnt and FGF signaling pathways in tumors
leads to more malignant phenotypes (4).
h-Catenin is a dual-function protein that plays a key role in
maintaining cell-cell adhesion and as a downstream effector of the
Wnt-signaling cascade. Association of E-cadherin with h-catenin
and a-catenin is crucial for stable cell-cell adhesion and binding
of h-catenin to these partners has been shown to be regulated
by tyrosine phosphorylation of h-catenin (5, 6). The stability of
h-catenin in the cytoplasm is regulated by a protein complex
composed of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axin, conductin,
and glycogen-synthase 3h (GSK-3h), which targets h-catenin for
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Activation of Wnt
signaling leads to inactivation of GSK-3h, resulting in accumulation
of cytoplasmic h-catenin, which then enters the nucleus and
interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors that activate transcription of genes containing TCF/LEF binding sites (7–9).
Phosphorylation of GSK3a at serine 21 or GSK3h at serine 9 upon
stimulation with growth factors such as insulin has been shown to
result in inhibition of GSK-3 kinase activity in mammalian cells
(10–12). Deregulation of Wnt signaling has been implicated as an
important event in the initiation and/or progression of several
malignancies, including colon cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma;
melanoma; and ovarian, endometrial, and prostate cancers
(7–9, 13). The APC gene is mutated in up to 80% of sporadic
colon cancers and loss of APC has been shown to induce irregular
stabilization and accumulation of h-catenin (14, 15).
FGFR4 is overexpressed in several types of human tumors,
including colon, liver, breast, neuroendocrine, and pancreatic
carcinoma (16–19). In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism
changing the sense codon 388 from glycine to arginine in the
transmembrane domain of the FGFR4 gene has been associated
with a poor prognosis for positive node breast cancer, high-grade
soft-tissue sarcoma, colon carcinoma, and head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (20–22). However, the role of FGF19 or
the effect of FGF19 inhibition in cancer remains poorly understood.
In the present study, using human colon cancer (HCT116, Colo201)
cells, we show that FGF19 increases GSK-3h phosphorylation (S9)
and active h-catenin, and induces h-catenin/TCF4–regulated
transcriptional activity. Inhibition of FGF19 with a blocking
antibody (1A6) increases S33/S37/T41 phosphorylation and ubiquitination of h-catenin and decreases h-catenin target gene
expression. Using paired HCT116 h-catenin knockout cells, we
show that FGF19 exerts its effect through modulation of wild-type
(WT) h-catenin. Moreover, inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–
mediated FGFR4 knockdown show reduced h-catenin pathway
signaling and decreased tumor growth in vivo and clonal growth
in vitro. These findings show that FGF19-FGFR4 cross-talk with
h-catenin signaling and that inactivation of either FGF19 or FGFR4
could help reduce tumorigenesis.

FGF19 Inhibition Reduces b-Catenin Signaling

Materials and Methods
HCT116 and Colo201 cell lines (American Type Culture Collection)
were routinely maintained at 37jC and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 4 mmol/L L-glutamine. HCT116 cells
harboring WT/D45 (parental) and their derivatives expressing only WT/
or mutant (/D45) h-catenin were obtained from the John Hopkins
University (Baltimore, MD; ref. 23) and routinely maintained in McCoy’s 5A
containing 10% FBS. Serum-starved cells were incubated with either vehicle
or FGF19 (50–250 ng/mL, 10 min). In separate experiments, cells
were treated with either control antibody (gp120) or FGF19 antibody
(1A6, 20 Ag/mL) for the indicated time points. To further evaluate the
effects on h-catenin activation, cells were pretreated with a proteasome
inhibitor, MG132 (Biomol) at 1 Amol/L concentration for 4 h followed by
1A6 treatment for 24 h to evaluate ubiquitination and phosphorylation of
S33/S37, S45, and T41 on h-catenin. After incubation, cells were washed in
cold PBS and lysed for either protein or RNA analyses.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in
modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [RIPA; 50 mmol/L Tris-Cl
(pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.25% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)] and clarified by centrifugation.
Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined using the BCA
protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins were incubated with
specific antibody immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose and washed, and
immunocomplexes were eluted in 2 Laemmli buffer. Proteins were
resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and
incubated with specific primary and secondary antibodies. The antibodies
used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were h-catenin
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) from BD Transduction; active h-catenin
directed against NH2-terminally dephosphorylated h-catenin, FRS2, phosphotyrosine (4G10), and E-cadherin mAb from UpState Biotech; phospho-hcatenin (S33/S37 and S45/T41 specific), phospho-GSK3h (S9), and GSK-3h
antibodies from Cell Signaling; and ubiquitin mAb from EMD Biosciences.
Mouse monoclonal FGF19 (1A6), FGFR4 (1G7), and control (gp120)
antibodies were developed in house (24). Where indicated, the membranes
were stripped (Pierce) and reprobed with another antibody. Quantitative
analyses of tyrosine and Ser/Thr phosphorylation of h-catenin were done by
determining the ratio between relative density of the total protein and the
phosphorylation band using the data from three separate experiments.
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry.
Indirect quantification of NH2-terminal h-catenin phosphorylation levels
was performed using linear ion-trap mass spectrometry (MS). h-Catenin
was immunoprecipitated from cells pretreated with MG132 followed by
control (gp120) or 1A6 antibody and separated using SDS-PAGE. Gels were
Coomassie stained and the h-catenin bands were cut out and reduced in
10 mmol/L DTT and cysteines were alkylated with 50 mmol/L iodoacetamide before tryptic digestion. The peptides were digested in trypsin
(10 ng/AL) in 50 mmol/L sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) and peptide mixtures
(3 mL) were loaded onto a 0.25  30 mm trapping cartridge packed with
Vydac 214MS low-TFA C4 beads. This cartridge was placed in-line with a
0.1  100 mm resolving column packed with Vydac 218MS C18 beads. The
resolving column was constructed using a ‘‘picofrit’’ (New Objective) fused
silica capillary pulled to a 15-mm metal-coated tip, which formed a
microelectrospray emitter. Peptides were eluted with 1-h gradients of
acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at a rate of 0.3 mL/min. Datadependent tandem MS was performed using a linear ion-trap instrument
(LTQ; Finnigan). The Sequest database searching program was used to
generate cross correlation scores for each CID spectrum. Proteins matched
by only a single peptide were confirmed by manual interpretation of the
collision-induced dissociation spectra. Phosphorylated peptides were
manually confirmed. Peak areas were then integrated to determine relative
abundance of peptides.
ShRNA studies. The pHUSH inducible vector system comprising a
shRNA expression shuttle plasmid and a viral vector backbone containing a
TetR-IRES-Puro cassette was used. FGFR4 knockdown vectors were
constructed by designing custom siRNA sequences converting them into

shRNA and testing their efficacy in transient cotransfection experiment
in 293T cells. Selected shRNA sequences (shFGFR4 forward:
GATCCCCGAACCGCATTGGAGGCATTATCAAGAGAAATGCCTCCAATGCGGTTCTTTTTTGGAAA; reverse: AGCTTT TCCAAAAAAGAACCGCATTGGAGGCATTTCTCTTGATAATGCCTCCAATGCGGTTCGGG; hEGFP
(shCTRL) forward: GATCCCCGCAGCACGACTTCTTCAAGTTCAAGAGACTTGAAGAAGTCGTGCTGCTTTTTTGGAAA; reverse: AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGCAGCACGACTTCTTCAAGTCTCTTGAACTTGAAGAAGTCGTGCTGCGGG) were cloned into pShuttle-H1 and then H1-shRNA
cassette was transferred into pHUSH-GW by a Gateway (Invitrogen)
recombination reaction. All constructs were verified by sequencing.
Generation of inducible-shRNA cell clones. HCT116 cells were
maintained in a medium containing tetracycline-free FBS and were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 plus (Invitrogen). As the puromycin
resistance gene encoded in the vector is under the control of a constitutive
h-actin promoter, 5 Ag/mL puromycin were used to select transfected cells
expressing shRNA. Stable clones were isolated, treated with 1 Ag/mL
doxycycline (BD Clontech) for 7 d, and functional FGFR4 knockdown was
assessed by Western blotting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis.
Reporter assays. TCF/LEF reporter assays were done following the
previously described procedure (25). HCT116 parental cells harboring
WT/D45 and their derivatives expressing only wild-type (WT/) or mutant
(/D45) h-catenin were obtained from the John Hopkins University (23).
HEK293 cells stably expressing FGFR4 (HEK293-hFGFR4) or empty vector
(HEK293-EV; control; ref. 26) were gifts from Dr. Desnoyers’ laboratory. Cells
were seeded in 24-well plates at 1.5  105 per well and the following day
were transiently transfected with pTOPglow (containing TCF binding sites),
or pFOPglow (mutant motif), pCAN LEF1, and pCMV-Renilla luciferase
(Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells
were either treated with 1A6 (10–50 Ag/mL) or serum starved overnight and
then treated with FGF19 (100–500 ng/mL) for 6 h. Luciferase activity was
measured using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). The relative
reporter activity was determined by calculating the mean TOP/FOP ratios
normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Values are presented as means F
SE from three separate experiments performed in duplicate.
Cell proliferation assay. The effect of FGFR4 knockdown on HCT116
cell proliferation was studied using shCTRL and shFGFR4 stable cell clones.
In brief, shCTRL and shFGFR4 stable cells were pretreated with or without
doxycycline (1 Ag/mL, 5 d), plated in 96-well culture plates, and continued
with or without doxycycline treatment during the assay. Cellular
proliferative activity was measured by quantification of 5¶-bromo-2¶deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation into the genomic DNA during cell
growth using a colorimetric BrdUrd ELISA assay kit following the
manufacturer’s (Roche) instructions. Absorbance was analyzed at dual
wavelengths of 450 to 540 nm. Values are presented as means F SE of two
individual experiments performed in replicate of 8.
Clonal growth assay. The effect of FGFR4 knockdown on cell
clonogenicity was assessed following a previously described protocol (27).
In brief, shCTRL and shFGFR4 stable cell clones (100 cells per well) were
seeded in 96-well culture plates in the presence and absence of doxycycline
(1 Ag/mL) and incubated for 10 d until cells in control wells have formed
sufficiently large clones. Colonies were stained (0.5% crystal violet) and the
relative density of stained colonies in a fixed area per well was measured
using Adobe Photoshop software. Values are presented as means F SE
(n = 10).
Xenograft studies. All animal protocols were approved by an
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Six- to eight-week-old
female athymic nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories) were inoculated in
the right flank with either 5  106 shCTRL- or human shFGFR4-containing
cell clones resuspended in 100 AL PBS. When tumors reached a mean
volume of 100 to 150 mm3, the mice with similarly sized tumors were
grouped into treatment cohorts. Mice received 5% sucrose only or 5%
sucrose plus 1 mg/mL doxycycline for control and knockdown cohorts,
respectively. All water bottles were changed thrice a week. Tumors were
measured with calipers and mice were weighed twice a week. Mice whose

Statistical analysis. Student’s two-tailed t test was used to compare data
between two groups. One-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s test were used to
compare data between three or more groups. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

tumors reached 2,000 mm3 were euthanized. Eight mice were used for each
treatment group and results are presented as mean tumor volume F SE.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue
specimens from shCTRL and shFGFR4 tumors treated with or without
doxycycline were collected and a routine H&E slide was evaluated. Antigen
retrieval was done using DAKO Target Retrieval Kit (DAKO) and
immunohistochemical staining was performed using anti–ki-67 (clone
MB-1, DAKO) and anti–cleaved caspase -3 (CC3; Cell Signaling) antibodies
and DAKO ABC kit. Tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin
and digital analysis for quantification of the proliferation index (i.e., the
percent of cells undergoing division/total nuclei) and positive immunoreactivity for CC3 was performed. Images used for Ki-67 and CC3 analyses
were acquired using an Ariol SL-50 slide scanning platform (Applied
Imaging; San Jose) and analyzed using Ariol software. Values are presented
as means F SE (n = 6).
B-Catenin target gene expression analyses. Total RNA was isolated
using the Qiagen RNA isolation kit and DNase treated (Qiagen) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was determined using ND1000 spectrophotometer. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to
determine the relative abundance of h-catenin target gene mRNAs. Humanspecific primers and fluorogenic probes for cyclin D1, CD44, c-jun, UPAR,
Cox-2, and RPL19 (Supplementary Table S1) were designed using Primer
Express 1.1 (Applied Biosystems). Analyses of data were performed using
Sequence Detector 1.6.3 (Applied Biosystems) and results for genes of
interest were normalized to RPL19.

FGF19 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of B-catenin and
causes loss of E-cadherin binding to B-catenin in HCT116 cells.
Because FGFs are suggested to collaborate with Wnt during
carcinogenesis (4), we sought to determine whether FGF19 affects
Wnt signaling using colon cancer cells (HCT116) that endogenously express both FGF19 and FGFR4. Treatment of colon cancer
cells (HCT116) with FGF19 (50–250 ng/mL) showed a significant
increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of h-catenin as early as
10 minutes (Fig. 1A) when compared with vehicle-treated controls.
Because h-catenin binding to cadherins to form stable cell-cell
adhesions has been shown to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of h-catenin, we next evaluated E-cadherin levels in cells
treated with FGF19 by stripping and reprobing the tyrosine
phosphorylation blot using E-cadherin antibody. The results
showed a substantial loss of E-cadherin binding to h-catenin and
this was inversely proportional to the tyrosine phosphorylation
levels (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when E-cadherin was
immunoprecipitated and immunoblot analysis was performed
using h-catenin antibody (data not shown).
FGF19 increases p-GSK-3B and activates B-catenin, and
treatment with 1A6 antibody reduces these effects of FGF19 in
colon cancer cells. Previous studies have established that Wntregulated h-catenin degradation is essential for carcinogenesis (7)
and that Wnt signals are transmitted through NH2-terminally
dephosphorylated h-catenin (28). GSK-3h plays a critical role in
this process (29). Treatment of HCT116 cells with FGF19 increased
p-GSK-3h (S9) and active h-catenin levels in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2A, top left). Using our recently developed anti-FGF19
monoclonal antibody, 1A6, that blocks FGF19 binding to FGFR4
and neutralizes FGF19 tumorigenic effects in vivo (24), we
determined the effect of FGF19 inhibition on h-catenin signaling
in HCT116 cells. Treatment of these cells with 1A6 antibody
reduced p-GSK-3h (S9) levels and significantly decreased active
h-catenin levels as early at 6 hours and sustained low levels up to
24 hours when compared with control antibody–treated cells
(71.8 F 1.5% decrease, P < 0.001; Fig. 2A, top right and bottom).
Similarly, treatment of Colo201 cells showed a dose-dependent
increase in p-GSK-3h (S9) and active h-catenin levels in response to
FGF19 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and FGF19 inhibition
with 1A6 antibody reduced p-GSK-3h (S9) and active h-catenin
levels as early as 3 hours and sustained the reduction up to 6 hours
significantly (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Treatment of additional
colon cancer cell lines (HT29 and SW620) with 1A6 antibody
also showed a substantial decrease in active h-catenin levels,
indicating that it is not a cell type–specific response (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Inhibition of FGF19 using 1A6 antibody induces S33/S37/
S45 and T41 phosphorylation. Because FGF19 inhibition reduced
active h-catenin levels in HCT116 cells, we next evaluated whether
1A6 treatment increases NH2-terminal Ser-Thr phosphorylation
and targets h-catenin for ubiquitination and proteasomic degradation. HCT116 cells pretreated with a proteasome inhibitor
(MG132, 1 Amol/L) for 4 hours followed by treatment with 1A6
antibody showed a significant increase in S33/S37 and S45/T41
phosphorylation (Fig. 2B) when compared with proteasome

inhibitor plus control antibody–treated cells. Quantification of
S33/S37 phosphorylation as determined by calculating the ratio
between the total h-catenin protein and phosphorylated protein
levels showed a 123.4 F 7% increase in 1A6 treated cells versus
control. Similarly, Ser45/T41phosphorylation was increased by 166.8
F 11% in 1A6-treated cells versus control (both P < 0.05). This
effect of 1A6 was coupled with increased h-catenin ubiquitination
(Fig. 2C) versus control. Colo201 cells pretreated with MG132
(1 Amol/L, 4 hours) followed by treatment with anti-FGF19
antibody also showed a substantial increase in S33/S37 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S2) when compared with control
antibody–treated cells.
Liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis confirms increased
NH2-terminal S33/S37/S45 and T41 phosphorylation of Bcatenin in 1A6 antibody–treated cells. To further confirm our
data showing increased Ser-Thr phosphorylations in the NH2

terminus of h-catenin upon 1A6 treatment, we compared signal
intensities of nonphosphorylated h-catenin peptide in cells
pretreated with a proteasome inhibitor followed by 1A6 or control
antibody using linear ion-trap MS. Because the phosphorylated
peptide is not detectable due to multiple phosphorylation sites and
its stoichiometric ratio to other nonphosphorylated peptides,
indirect quantification method was used to detect nonphosphorylated (control) versus phosphorylated (1A6) peptides. Under these
conditions, nonphosphorylated peptide would give higher intensity
and phosphorylated peptide would give lower intensity. The data
were normalized to other nonrelated peptides (containing all four
phosphorylation sites) that showed no difference in signal
intensities from the treated and untreated samples. The h-catenin
peptide isolated from 1A6-treated cells showed lower signal
intensity when compared with h-catenin peptide isolated from
control antibody–treated cells (Fig. 2D), clearly indicating an

NH2-terminal h-catenin phosphorylation levels using linear ion-trap MS. Data-dependent tandem MS on NH2-terminal peptide from immunoprecipitated h-catenin from
cells treated with MG132 followed by control antibody or 1A6 (top ) was performed using a linear ion-trap instrument as described in Materials and Methods.
Cross-correlation scores for each CID spectrum were generated and the relative abundance of peptides was determined. The data were normalized to the signal
intensities of other nonrelated peptides that showed no difference in signal intensities from the treated and untreated samples (bottom ).

FGFR4 knockdown using shRNA significantly reduces active
B-catenin levels and decreases clonogenicity in vitro. To
determine whether inhibition of FGFR4 receptor would mimic
the effect of FGF19 inhibition with 1A6 antibody, we analyzed
FGFR4 and shCTRL HCT116 stable cell lines for active h-catenin
levels. Quantification of relative density of FGFR4 protein
expression levels in shCTRL stable cells did not show any
significant change with (261.6 F 17.5) and without (261.75 F

were significantly reduced in doxycycline-treated shFGFR4 stable
cells (163.25 F 7.4, P = 0.003). Non–doxycycline-treated shFGFR4
stable cells also showed a slight reduction (230.88 F 17.3) in FGFR4
expression, indicating some leakiness (Fig. 3A). FACS analysis for
FGFR4 in doxycycline-treated shFGFR4 stable cells showed a
significant reduction in FGFR4 expression versus doxycyclinetreated shCTRL stable cells or shFGFR4 without doxycycline

treatment (Fig. 3B). Leakiness of the TetR-IRES cassette was also
apparent with FACS analysis. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates
from shFGFR4 stable cells (that showed effective FGFR4 expression
knockdown) showed a significant decrease in active h-catenin
levels when compared with shCTRL stable cells (Fig. 3A), clearly
indicating involvement of FGF19 in modulating h-catenin signaling
in colon cancer cells. Similar reduction in active h-catenin levels
were observed in other shFGFR4 clones (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Furthermore, analysis of FRS2 phosphorylation in shCTRL and
shFGFR4 stable cell clones shows that the steady-state phosphorylation levels are decreased in FGFR4 knockdown cells (shFGFR4 +
doxycycline) when compared with controls (shCTRL F doxycycline
and shFGFR4 without doxycycline treatment; Supplementary
Fig. S4).
Next, to determine whether FGFR4 knockdown has any
biological effect, we assessed cell proliferation and colony-forming
ability using these stable cells. The rate of cell proliferation as
determined by BrdUrd incorporation into cellular DNA only shows

FGF19 Inhibition Reduces b-Catenin Signaling

a very modest change between shCTRL cells and shFGFR4 stable
cells in the presence of doxycycline without reaching statistical
significance (Supplementary Fig. S5). However, shFGFR4 stable
cells treated with doxycycline show a significant reduction in
colony-forming ability when compared with shCTRL stable cells
treated with and without doxycycline (P = 0.0015 and 0.00001,
respectively; Fig. 3C and D). In addition to the larger number of
colonies formed, the phenotype of colonies of shCTRL stables is
more robust and larger in size than those of FGFR4 knockdown
stable cells (Fig. 3C).
FGFR4 knockdown stable cells show reduced tumor growth
in vivo. Because we found that 1A6 affects h-catenin signaling
in vitro, we next investigated whether inhibition of the FGF19/
FGFR4 pathway affects growth of tumor xenografts in vivo using
shFGFR4 stable cells. As determined by tumor volume measurements, FGFR4 knockdown significantly reduced tumor growth
when compared with shCTRL stable controls (day 21: 62 F 6%

reduction, n = 8; Fig. 4A). Further analyses of tumor tissues for
FGFR4 and active h-catenin levels showed a significant reduction
in FGFR4 expression, FRS2 phosphorylation, and active h-catenin
levels in shFGFR4 + doxycycline group versus shCTRL + doxycycline group (Fig. 4B). These results correlated well with the
tumor volumes. This is also consistent with our recent study
showing that 1A6 antibody treatment of colon cancer cell tumor
xenografts (HCT116, Colo201) in athymic nude mice significantly
reduces tumor growth versus control antibody treatment group
and that this was associated with substantially reduced FGFR4
phosphorylation and active h-catenin levels in the 1A6-treated
group versus control (24). Similar reduction in tumor growth was
observed in animals inoculated with other clones of shFGFR4
stable cells and treatment with doxycycline (data not shown).
Histologic analyses of ki67 nuclear antigen in tissue sections of
xenograft tumors showed a significant decrease in the number of
ki67-postive nuclei in FGFR4 knockdown tumors versus shCTRL

tumors. Non–doxycycline-treated shFGFR4 group also showed a
small reduction in ki67-positive nuclei versus shCTRL group
(Fig. 4C and D). This is consistent with our FACS and immunoblotting data that indicate leakiness of TetR-IRES cassette. Immunoreactivity for cleaved caspase-3 did not show any significant
change between any groups studied (Supplementary Fig. S6).
FGF19 induces B-catenin/TCF-4–regulated transcriptional
activity. To ascertain whether FGF19 activates h-catenin/TCF-4–
regulated transcription activity, we assessed TCF/LEF reporter
activity in response to FGF19 using HCT116-WT/D45 (parental)
and its /D45 and WT/ derivatives (23). Interestingly, FGF19
treatment significantly increased TCF/LEF reporter activity in
parental and WT/ cells but not in mutant (/D45) derivative
(Fig. 5A). Likewise, inhibition of endogenous FGF19 with 1A6
antibody significantly reduced the TCF/LEF reporter activity in
parental and WT/ cells but not in mutants (/D45; Fig. 5B),
indicating that FGF19 modulates mostly WT h-catenin. To further
confirm whether FGFR4 signaling affects h-catenin transcriptional
activity, we used HEK293 stably overexpressing FGFR4 (inset in
Supplementary Fig. S7) and determined TCF/LEF reporter activity.
Activation of FGFR4 with either FGF1 or FGF19 induced TCF/LEF
reporter activity when compared with untreated controls (Supplementary Fig. S8). FGF1 or FGF19 treatment did not induce any
reporter activity in control vector–transfected HEK293 stable cells
versus untreated control (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Inhibition of FGF19/FGFR4 reduces B-catenin target gene
expression in vitro and in vivo. Because FGF19 inhibition
reduced active h-catenin levels and increased targeting h-catenin

for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, we next sought to
determine whether 1A6 affects h-catenin target gene expression
levels using real-time quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig. 6, 1A6
treatment consistently reduced cyclin D1, CD44, c-jun, Cox-2,
and UPAR mRNA expression levels at 6 hours when compared with
the control antibody–treated cells. Similar results were obtained
from shRNA xenograft tissues showing reduced h-catenin target
gene expression in FGFR4 knockdown group versus control
(Supplementary Fig. S8).

Discussion
Increasing evidence suggests that functional cross-talk exists
between regulatory and signaling molecules. Our studies explore
the potential involvement of FGF19 and its receptor FGFR4 in the
regulation of the E-cadherin/catenin system. In the present study
using colon cancer cells (HCT16, Colo201), we examined the effect
of FGF19 and the effect of anti-FGF19 blocking antibody on Ecadherin and h-catenin binding and the activation of h-catenin
signaling both in vitro and in vivo.
h-Catenin is downstream in the Wnt signaling pathway and
plays important roles in the structural organization and function of
cadherins by linking cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton through
a-catenin (30, 31). The formation and maintenance of stable
cell-cell adhesion is dependent on the association E-cadherin with
h-catenin and a-catenin and loss of E-cadherin expression or
function in epithelial carcinomas is associated with the loss of cellcell adhesion and of tumors to invasive and/or metastatic state

FGF19 Inhibition Reduces b-Catenin Signaling

(32). Moreover, the regulation of cadherin-mediated adhesion is
suggested to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of h-catenin (5). In the present study, we found that
exogenous FGF19 increases tyrosine phosphorylation of h-catenin
and this was inversely proportional to the loss of E-cadherin–hcatenin binding in HCT116 cells, indicating that FGF19 could
possibly potentiate colon tumor growth and metastasis. Ezzat and
co-workers have shown that treatment of mice bearing GH4
pituitary tumor xenografts with FGFR4 tyrosine kinase inhibitor
results in recovery of membranous N-cadherin and reduces tumor
growth, suggesting that FGFR4-N-cadherin plays an important role
in neoplastic cell growth and invasiveness (33). In contrast, ElHariry and co-workers have shown that FGF1 and FGF2 enhance
association of catenins with E-cadherin in a panel of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cell lines (34), indicating that FGFs could elicit a
cell-type–specific response.
In normal cells, h-catenin is phosphorylated and subsequently
ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasomal system and
this degradation is initiated by phosphorylation at S45, T41, S37,
and S33 at its NH2-terminal region (35, 36). When Wnt signaling is
inactive, h-catenin forms a complex with casein kinase 1a (CKIa),
GSK-3h, and a scaffold protein Axin, resulting in CKIa-mediated
phosphorylation of h-catenin S45 and this phosphorylation at S45
serves as a priming phosphorylation event for GSK3h (37–39).
The HCT116 cell line expresses FGF19, FGFR4, full-length APC, p53,
and heterozygous mutations of h-catenin, harboring both wild-type
and deletion mutant (Ser45) forms of h-catenin (40). The Colo201
cell line has both somatic APC mutations and h-catenin mutations
and the mutated (A-to-G in codon 287) sequence in h-catenin is
believed not to conform to any known consensus phosphorylation
site (41). As reported earlier, we found both parental (WT/D45) and
mutant h-catenin (/D45) cells having higher h-catenin/TCF-4–
regulated transcription activity when compared with WT/ cells

(23). Moreover, FGF19 substantially increased the TCF/LEF
reporter activity only in HCT116 parental (WT/D45) and WT/
cells but not in mutant (/D45) derivative. This was also
consistent with 1A6 treatment reducing TCF/LEF reporter activity
in HCT116 parental (WT/D45) and WT/ cells without having any
effect on mutant (/D45) cells, indicating that WT h-catenin is
accessible for modulation in these cells. In addition, our experiments in Colo201 cells showing that h-catenin (S33/S37) is
phosphorylated upon 1A6 antibody treatment and dephosphorylated after FGF19 stimulation find support from a previous study
showing h-catenin transcriptional activation in these cells through
the dephosphorylation of S37/T41 residues in the NH2 terminus of
h-catenin (42).
The present study also elucidated the mechanism of 1A6inhibitory effect on h-catenin signaling by showing that 1A6 targets
h-catenin for proteasomal degradation by increased Ser/Thr
phosphorylation in the NH2-terminal region of h-catenin and
ubiquitination of h-catenin using both immunoblotting and iontrap MS. Although Wang and co-workers have shown that in
HCT116 cells, phosphorylation of h-catenin at S45 is not required
for phosphorylation of residues S33/S37 or T41 (43), our data
showing 1A6 increases h-catenin ubiquitination in parental HCT116
cells (WT/D45) and that 1A6 treatment does not affect TCF/LEF
reporter activity in mutant (/D45) cells indicate that the mutant
form is unlikely to be ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded.
FGFR4 knockdown using shRNA significantly reduced active
h-catenin levels in vitro and in vivo, further validating the effect of
FGF19/FGFR4 pathway inhibition on h-catenin. In the present
study (in vitro), we found that FGFR4 knockdown has very little
effect on cell proliferation but has a substantial effect on
clonogenicity. In addition, our immunohistochemistry data show
that FGFR4 knockdown-xenograft tumor tissues exhibit reduced
ki67-positive nuclei, but show no change in cleaved caspase-3

UPAR ) were analyzed by Taqman analysis. Analyses of data
were performed using Sequence Detector 1.6.3 (PE Applied
Biosystems) and results were normalized to RPL19.

levels. These results suggest that the reduced tumor growth in the
FGFR4 knockdown group could be due to reduced clonogenic
ability rather than increased apoptosis. The shRNA stables used in
the xenograft studies were derived from parental HCT116 cells
(WT/D45) and the data showing that 1A6 has no effect on mutant
h-catenin–mediated TCF/LEF transcriptional activity suggest that
the inability of FGFR4-shRNA to completely inhibit tumor growth
in vivo is mostly due to the presence of mutant h-catenin.
In addition, our data show a steady-state level of FRS2
phosphorylation in the xenografted tumors and in shCTRL stable
cells (in vitro) and inhibition of FGF19 signaling with either 1A6
antibody (24) or FGFR4 knockdown with shRNA reduces this FRS2
phosphorylation level, indicating an autocrine regulation of the
FGF/FGFR4 loop. Our recent study showed that in addition to
reduced active h-catenin levels, FRS2 and extracellular signalregulated kinase 2 (ERK2) phosphorylation were also decreased in
1A6-treated xenograft tumor tissues (24), indicating possible
involvement of more than one signaling pathway. Nevertheless,
earlier studies have also reported cross-regulation of Wnt signaling
pathway by mitogen-activated protein kinases (44, 45). Therefore,
more studies are under way to ascertain the possibility of FRS2ERK–mediated priming of GSK3h during FGF19/FGFR4–mediated
activation of h-catenin signaling pathway.
Although several lines of evidence suggest that Wnt regulate FGF
genes (including FGF16, FGF18, FGF20 ), whether h-catenin
regulates FGF19 remains unknown (4, 6, 46, 47). Inhibition of
h-catenin using siRNA completely abolished FGF19 expression in
HCT116 cells,4 indicating that h-catenin regulates FGF19 expres4

sion in colon cancer cells. Sporadic reports suggest that FGFs
regulate Wnt-target genes (48, 49). In support of our data showing
reduced active h-catenin levels and TCF/LEF reporter activity, we
have shown that blocking FGF19/FGFR4 signaling also significantly
reduces h-catenin target genes (cyclin D1, CD44, c-jun, Cox-2, and
UPAR) in vitro and in vivo. Using more than one cell line, we show
that FGF19 modulates h-catenin signaling pathway both in vitro
and in vivo, therefore suggesting that FGF19/FGFR4–mediated
activation of h-catenin signaling is not a cell type–specific
response. Our studies showing a molecular link between FGF19
and h-catenin signaling pathway is further supported by an earlier
report showing that Wnt signaling is attenuated in FGFR1/
mice (50). Taken together, our present findings suggest that the
inactivation of FGF19 and/or FGFR4 could be beneficial in rescuing
cells from deregulated signaling of h-catenin and therefore for the
treatment of colon cancer and other malignancies involving
interaction of FGF19 and FGFR4.
