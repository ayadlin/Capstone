BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effects of the first 18 months of anastrozole therapy on
cognitive function in women with breast cancer. METHODS: This large, longitudinal cohort study was composed of postmenopausal
women with early-stage breast cancer who received chemotherapy plus anastrozole (n 5 114) or anastrozole alone (n 5 173) and a
control group (n 5 110). Cognitive function was assessed before systemic therapy and 6, 12, and 18 months after therapy initiation and
at comparable time points in controls. RESULTS: The chemotherapy-anastrozole and anastrozole-alone groups had poorer executive
function than the controls at nearly all time points (P <.0001 to P 5.09). A pattern of deterioration in working memory and concentration was observed during the first 6 months of anastrozole therapy for the chemotherapy-anastrozole group (P <.0001 and
P <.0009, respectively) and the anastrozole-alone group (P 5.0008 and P 5.0002, respectively). This was followed by improved
working memory and concentration from 6 to 12 months in both groups. The anastrozole-alone group had a second decline in working memory and concentration from 12 to 18 months after the initiation of therapy (P <.0001 and P 5.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Women with breast cancer had poorer executive functioning from the period before therapy through the entire first 18
months of therapy. A pattern of decline in working memory and concentration with initial exposure to anastrozole was observed.
Women receiving anastrozole alone had a second deterioration in working memory and concentration from 12 to 18 months after
therapy initiation. The longer term effects (>18 months) of anastrozole on cognitive function remain to be determined. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Even though more than 70% of women with breast cancer receive adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), few studies have
examined the specific influence of ET on cognitive function in this population. Most research on ET-associated cognitive
changes has focused on selective estrogen receptor modulators and particularly tamoxifen.1,2 Few studies have examined
cognitive function with aromatase inhibitors (AIs), which are more commonly used in postmenopausal women. To date,
study results have been inconsistent, partly because of methodological differences.3-10 Among the few prospective studies,8,11 the sample sizes were small, and some participants had begun ET at the baseline assessment; thus, there was no true
pretreatment cognitive evaluation. Finally, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the potential contribution of
chemotherapy to the influence of ET on cognitive function in women with breast cancer.
Multiple mechanisms, including changes in reproductive hormones, likely underlie cognitive declines in women
with breast cancer (Fig. 1). AIs provide almost complete estradiol withdrawal by blocking the aromatase enzyme,12 and we
found that lower estradiol was associated with poorer psychomotor efficiency, attention, and executive function with
therapy.13
We also found poorer cognitive function with anastrozole versus tamoxifen in a small cross-sectional study.14 We
now report the results of a large cohort study of postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer who received chemotherapy plus anastrozole or anastrozole alone versus a control group of women without breast cancer. The purpose of this
study was to examine and compare the effect of anastrozole on cognitive function in these 3 cohorts before therapy and 6,
12, and 18 months after therapy commenced and at comparable time points in controls. We hypothesized that women

cancer participants. Controls met the same participation
criteria. All participants provided written informed consent; the study protocol was approved by the institutional
review board.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Women with breast cancer were recruited from the Comprehensive Breast Cancer Program of the University of
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute between 2005 and 2012. Of
the eligible women approached, 397 agreed to participate.
Eligible women were newly diagnosed with stage I, II, or
IIIa breast cancer; were scheduled to receive chemotherapy plus anastrozole (n 5 114) or anastrozole alone
(n 5 173); were postmenopausal; were 75 years old or
younger; and were able to speak and read English with 8
years of education. Women who had a history of neurological illness or cancer, reported hospitalization for psychiatric illness within 2 years, or had evidence of
metastases were excluded.
Age- and education-matched controls without breast
cancer (n 5 110) were recruited from the University Center for Social and Urban Research via random digit dialing, responses to a local ad, or referrals of friends by breast

Design

2628

With a prospective, observational cohort, repeated measure design, participants were evaluated after surgery but
before they began chemotherapy (if applicable) and anastrozole and at 6-month intervals up to 18 months after
they had begun anastrozole (Table 1). The 6-month
assessment in the chemotherapy-anastrozole group
occurred after chemotherapy and before anastrozole initiation. Controls were assessed at comparable time points.
Demographic information was collected at the baseline,
and treatment information was verified via the medical
record.
Measures

Cognitive function was assessed with a standardized neuropsychological battery evaluating multiple cognitive
domains. Cognitive tests were selected on the basis of their
established sensitivity to cognitive changes in this

population and on the basis of the availability of alternate
equivalent versions used with the controlsâ€™ scores to mitigate practice effects at follow-up testing.14 The comprehensive battery was administered and scored by nurses
trained by a licensed clinical neuropsychologist, and it
comprised 13 measures, some yielding multiple scores
(Table 2). Because of the number of cognitive variables,
we applied a data reduction technique to decrease the risk
of a type I error. Exploratory factor analysis with principal
component extraction and orthogonal rotation was
applied to the 29 scores derived from the measures to
reduce dimensionality and cluster scores. Eight factors
were derived, and they accounted for 71% of the total variance. Individual measures with the highest loadings were
included in each factor. Measures had factor
loadings > 0.400; the factors and scores composing each
factor are listed in Table 3. We reversed the direction of
some scores (timed, errors) so that higher mean scores
indicated better cognitive performance. Cognitive factors
were derived as means of the individual measures z scoreâ€“
transformed with respect to the controlsâ€™ baseline values.
We also examined potential covariates of cognitive
function, including age, and well-validated measures of
estimated verbal intelligence (National Adult Reading

Testâ€“Revised24), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression
Inventory II25), anxiety (Profile of Mood States tension/
anxiety subscale26), and fatigue (Profile of Mood States fatigue/inertia subscale26). Age and estimated verbal intelligence were assessed at the baseline in all groups;
depressive symptoms, anxiety, and fatigue were assessed at
all study time points.
Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were generated to characterize the
groups and identify any data anomalies that may have
invalidated planned analyses. Groups were compared on
categorical descriptors with chi-square tests and on continuous characteristics with an analysis of variance.
We performed linear mixed effects modeling of the
derived composite scores and adjusted for age and estimated verbal intelligence at baseline. Where we found significant group, time, or group-by-time effects, we
examined differences between groups and changes over
time and calculated effect sizes for significant differences.
To control for multiple comparisons, we established a
conservative significance level at P < .01. Because of the
potential influence of practice effects, we applied a standard regression-based approach where applicable; data

from the controls were used to adjust for practice effects
in the treatment groups.
RESULTS
Table 4 shows the sample characteristics at enrollment.
The anastrozole-alone group was older (P < .001), and
controls had higher estimated intelligence scores
(P < .001). The chemotherapy-anastrozole group had a
higher disease stage than the anastrozole-alone group
(P < .001) and greater anxiety than both groups
(P < .001).
Differences at enrollment in factor z scores and individual neuropsychological test scores are shown in Table
3. Before therapy, women with breast cancer performed
worse than controls on measures of mental flexibility
(P < .01). In contrast, women who received chemotherapy plus anastrozole had better executive function than
controls (P 5 .016). The groups did not differ before therapy on the other cognitive factors.
Cognitive Function

Controlling for age and estimated intelligence, we found
that the controls had better executive function than the
anastrozole-alone group before therapy (P 5 .001,
d 5 .14) and 6 (P 5 .002, d 5 .12), 12 (P 5 .0001,
d 5 .14), and 18 months (P < .0001, d 5 .16) after therapy initiation (Fig. 2A-C). Similarly, there was a trend toward the controls performing better than the
chemotherapy-anastrozole groups before chemotherapy
(P 5 .04, d 5 .08) and at 6 months (P 5 .09, d 5 .06),
and controls performed significantly better at 12
(P 5 .005, d 5 .10) and 18 months (P 5 .001, d 5 .11).
We also found significant group, (P 5 .004) time

visual working memory and significant group-by-time
effects (P 5 .0005) for concentration. Both the
anastrozole-alone and chemotherapy-anastrozole groups
showed a pattern of decline during the first 6 months of
anastrozole for these factors. We observed a decline in visual working memory in the first 6 months of therapy
(P 5 .0008, d 5 .15) in the anastrozole-alone group; this
was followed by an improvement from 6 to 12 months
(P < .0001, d 5 .45) and another decline from 12 to 18
months (P < .0001, d 5 .24). After an initial improvement in visual working memory during chemotherapy,
the chemotherapy-anastrozole group also displayed a
deterioration during the first 6 months of anastrozole
(P < .0001, d 5 .26), and this was followed by an
improvement in function from 12 to 18 months
(P < .0001, d 5 .32). The performance of the controls
improved from 6 to 12 months (P 5 .003). Similarly, we
observed a deterioration in concentration from the period
before therapy to 6 months after therapy initiation in the
anastrozole-alone group (P 5 .0002, d 5 .17), an
improvement from 6 to 12 months (P 5 .001, d 5 .15),
and a trend toward a decline from 12 to 18 months
(P 5 .02, d 5 .12). In the chemotherapy-anastrozole
group, we observed a deterioration in concentration during the first 6 months of anastrozole (P < .0009, d 5 .15)
followed by an improvement from 12 to 18 months
(P 5 .008, d 5 .14). No change in concentration was
observed in controls.
There were also group differences for visual memory
(P 5 .002); the controls performed more poorly than the
chemotherapy-anastrozole groups before therapy
(P 5 .004) and the anastrozole-alone and chemotherapyanastrozole groups at 18 months, (P 5 .001 and

demonstrated practice effects.
DISCUSSION
In this first large cohort study to comprehensively assess
cognitive function over 18 months, we found that in comparison with controls, women who received anastrozole
alone or chemotherapy plus anastrozole had significantly

poorer executive function from the period before therapy
through the first 18 months of treatment. We also found a
consistent pattern of changes in visual working memory
and concentration with therapy.
Poorer Executive Function

Women in both breast cancer groups had poorer executive
functioning before and during therapy that did not appear
to be influenced by treatment. Multiple mechanisms,
including changes in inflammatory cytokines, neurotransmitter dysregulation, stress, and mood, may explain this
persistently poorer executive functioning.27 We found
depressive symptoms to be related to executive function
over time, but this relationship did not substantively
change the pattern of results. Executive functioning is critical for planning, organizing, and decision making, and
impairment of this domain can have a deleterious effect
on oneâ€™s ability to perform effectively at work and
socially.
Before Chemotherapy to the Pre-Anastrozole
Assessment

Before chemotherapy, women with breast cancer who
received chemotherapy had a trend toward better visual
working memory in comparison with controls, and their
performance improved at the pre-anastrozole assessment;
this suggested practice effects. There was no change in the
controls on this factor.
Pre-Anastrozole Assessment to 6 Months After
Anastrozole Initiation

There was a significant deterioration in visual working
memory and concentration in both the chemotherapyanastrozole and anastrozole-alone groups with the first 6
months of anastrozole. In comparison with controls,
women who received chemotherapy plus anastrozole had
a trend toward poorer performance 6 months after anastrozole initiation. Controls had no change in performance
in these factors. Reductions in reproductive hormones
that occur with AIs may explain this initial decline in performance in both treatment groups.
Six to 12 Months After Anastrozole Initiation

Paradoxically, the deterioration in visual working memory
and concentration that occurred with the initial 6 months
of anastrozole was followed by improved performance in
these domains at 12 months. In comparison with controls,
women in the chemotherapy-anastrozole and anastrozolealone groups performed better 12 months after anastrozole initiation. It is not clear why women with breast cancer have improved performance in these domains during
Cancer

this interval. Their reproductive hormone levels likely
remain low with continued therapy. This may reflect
compensation for the cognitive changes initially
experienced.
We explored whether cognitive reserve contributed
to this improvement. Cognitive reserve theory postulates
that intelligence, education, mental activity, and social
engagement mitigate or compensate for cognitive deterioration.28,29 In our study, higher estimated verbal intelligence was highly significantly correlated with better
cognitive function in all domains. Therefore, we explored
whether cognitive reserve, assessed via estimated verbal
intelligence (National Adult Readingâ€“Revised scores classified as IQ  110 or > 110), explained this pattern. We
found that the National Adult Readingâ€“Revised classification moderated the group-by-time effect for visual working memory (P 5 .05) but not concentration, so the
performance of women receiving anastrozole alone with a
higher estimated intelligence had better working memory
than those with a lower estimated intelligence (P 5 .05).
Therefore, greater cognitive reserve may partially explain
the improvement observed with respect to visual working
memory.
Twelve to 18 Months After Anastrozole Initiation

However, from 12 to 18 months, the anastrozole-alone
group again exhibited a decline in working memory and a
trend toward a deterioration in concentration. If cognitive
reserve theory provides a plausible explanation for the
improvement in working memory and concentration
observed from 6 to 12 months, the deterioration in working memory at 18 months suggests that the ability of variables such as intelligence and education to mitigate the
effects of therapy on cognitive function diminishes over
time. Another plausible mechanism for these later cognitive declines may be that the additive effect of chronic
stress associated with the cancer diagnosis and treatment
results in changes in the prefrontal regions.30 The affected
domains suggest a central neurotoxicity with some specificity to the prefrontal cortices and hippocampus, and this
is supported by imaging studies.31,32 Initial exposure to
anastrozole and the secondary hypoestrogenism might
reduce brain metabolism33,34 and synaptic connectivity35,36 and lead to cognitive decline.37 Hypocortisolemia
from stress also might independently reduce brain metabolism and synaptic density. Thus, the combination of
stress and hypoestrogenism may compromise cognitive
function in domains such as working memory and concentration.38 Initially, the brain may have sufficient
reserves to be able to generate new cognitive strategies, but
2633

with persistent hypoestrogenism, with or without stress,
even alternative neural pathways may be compromised.39
To explore this possibility, we controlled for depression, anxiety, and fatigue over time in the mixed effects
modeling and found that higher anxiety was related to
poorer visual working memory (P 5 .04). On the basis of
this finding, we compared anxiety scores between groups
and explored changes over time, and we found a groupby-time interaction for the chemotherapy-anastrozole
group; this indicated that these women had significantly
more anxiety at the baseline, improved to show no differences from the other groups at 6 months, and then
became more anxious than the other groups from 12 to
18 months. No differences in anxiety were found between
the anastrozole-alone and control groups, with anxiety
scores generally decreasing over 18 months. These results
point to an association between anxiety and visual working memory for women who received chemotherapy plus
anastrozole, but they do not fully explain the trajectory of
this cognitive factor. Neither depressive symptoms nor fatigue was consistently associated with the cognitive function factors at any time point. Although these results lend
some support to the relationship between chronic stress
and the deterioration in cognitive function in women
receiving adjuvant therapy, they do not fully explain our
results. It is important to keep in mind that a measure of
anxiety (Profile of Mood States tension/anxiety subscale)
may not be an optimal surrogate of chronic stress. Ultimately, these results point to a need for further exploration of this potential mechanism with more sensitive
approaches to the assessment of stress, including the use of
biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques.
Studies of cognitive function with ET in breast cancer have yielded conflicting results. Tamoxifen has been
associated with deteriorations in visual and verbal memory, verbal ability, processing speed, and visuospatial ability.7,40-42 The evidence for cognitive changes with AIs is
less clear, in part because few studies have examined cognitive function exclusively with AIs. Moreover, methodological concerns and differences hinder efforts to compare
results across studies. Samples in some earlier studies were
heterogeneous and combined premenopausal women and
postmenopausal women3,10,11,41 and women who
received AIs and women who received tamoxifen.8,10,42,43
Several studies had small samples3,8,40-42,44 and lacked
control groups, which are essential for the comparison
and isolation of the influence of practice effects.3,10,11,45
Different approaches to cognitive assessment may
explain the contradictory results. Some studies employed
cognitive screening: they provided information about
2634

global cognitive changes but failed to detect subtle
changes more commonly experienced or to identify
changes in specific cognitive domains.1 Other studies
relied on self-reporting of cognitive problems6,46 or used
measures that were initially developed to assess gross cognitive disorders in patients with stroke, neurotrauma, or
dementia.3,7,10,11,47 We included measures from the
Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery,16 a computerized battery composed of challenging
cognitive tasks that may be more sensitive to these subtle
changes. Importantly, several earlier studies employed a
cross-sectional design,4,40-42,44,45 and in some longitudinal studies, no true pretherapy assessment was made
because many participants had already begun ET therapy
at the baseline3,8,11,48 or received chemotherapy before
the initial cognitive assessment.10 With these designs, it is
not possible to discern whether cognitive impairments
existed before therapy or whether there were cognitive
changes with AI therapy. Our results indicate that women
with breast cancer have poorer executive function before
they begin therapy, and this demonstrates the importance
of longitudinal designs that include assessments before the
initiation of any systemic therapy, including
chemotherapy.
Finally, conflicting results across longitudinal studies may reflect differences in the timing of follow-up
assessments.7,10 Our study is the first to report assessments
at 6-month intervals up to 18 months after the initiation
of ET.
With the exception of the poorer executive function
for the anastrozole-alone group versus controls before AI
initiation (d 5 0.61), most effect sizes for differences
between patients and controls were small to medium (ie,
d < 0.4). Studies using objective neuropsychological tests
have shown subtle cognitive declines during AI therapy.
These effects may reflect the level of sensitivity of some
study measures to subtle cognitive changes experienced by
women with breast cancer.49,50 These subtle cognitive
changes may decrease womenâ€™s ability to perform in cognitively challenging situations.51
Although the cohorts differed in age, estimated
intelligence, and anxiety before therapy, these differences
were likely not clinically meaningful. Furthermore, we
controlled for age and intelligence in our analysis, and the
level of anxiety in the chemotherapy-anastrozole group
(mean, 9.8) was within the normative value for adult
women (mean, 9.2).26
The strengths of this study include the longitudinal
design, the inclusion of a pretherapy assessment, and the
ability to examine the potential additive influence of

chemotherapy on the effects of AIs on cognitive function.
The study is limited by a sample predominantly composed of white, well-educated women, and this limits
generalizability.
Additional research is needed to examine cognitive
function across the entire trajectory of AI therapy and to
determine whether cognitive function improves after
treatment completion. Interventions to attenuate cognitive decline are also needed. Physical activity interventions
may be of particular benefit because they are associated
with improved working memory, executive function, and
psychomotor efficiency in older adults, the very cognitive
domains that deteriorate with adjuvant therapy use in
breast cancer.52
