ABSTRACT
Reduced expression of microRNA122 (miR122), a liver-specific microRNA, is
frequent in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its biological significances
remain poorly understood. Because deregulated amino acid levels in cancers can
affect their biological behavior, we determined the amino acid levels in miR122silenced mouse liver tissues, in which intracellular arginine levels were significantly
increased. The increased intracellular arginine levels were through upregulation of
the solute carrier family 7 (SLC7A1), a transporter of arginine and a direct target of
miR122. Arginine is the substrate for nitric oxide (NO) synthetase, and intracellular
NO levels were increased in miR122-silenced HCC cells, with increased resistance to
sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor. Conversely, maintenance of the miR122-silenced
HCC cells in arginine-depleted culture media, as well as overexpression of miR122
in miR122-low-expressing HCC cells, reversed these effects and rendered the cells
more sensitive to sorafenib. Using a reporter knock-in construct, chemical compounds
were screened, and Wee1 kinase inhibitor was identified as upregulators of miR122
transcription, which increased the sensitivity of the cells to sorafenib. These results
provide an insight into sorafenib resistance in miR122-low HCC, and suggest that
arginine depletion or a combination of sorafenib with the identified compound may
provide promising approaches to managing this HCC subset.

The expression of miR122, a liver-specific
microRNA (miRNA), is frequently repressed in human
HCC [4], and this is functionally linked with aggressive
phenotypes in HCC cells [5, 6]. Mice lacking the gene
encoding miR122 suffer from liver steatosis and HCC,
suggesting a critical role of miR122 in metabolic
homeostasis and oncogenesis in the liver [7, 8]. In vivo
studies inhibiting miR122 function also showed effects on

INTRODUCTION
HCC is the third most common cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide [1]. Although advances
in early detection and novel therapies have improved
prognosis, no effective therapy other than the multi-kinase
inhibitor, sorafenib [2], is currently available for advanced
disease [3].

fatty acid and iron metabolism [7, 9–13], suggesting that
miR122 had pleiotropic metabolic effects [14].
The principal function of miRNAs is the
posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by
base pairing to their target mRNAs. Although numerous
genes have been recognized as candidates, few have
been confirmed experimentally as direct targets of
miR122. Among the genes identified, cationic amino
acid transporter member 1 (CAT1, also known as solute
carrier family 7, SLC7A1) is the best-known direct target
of miR122. Because SLC7A1 is a well-known arginine
transporter [15], it was hypothesized that repressed
miR122 expression in HCC would lead to deregulated
levels of intracellular amino acids, especially arginine,
which may affect the biological phenotype of HCC.
Sorafenib is currently the only systemic treatment
for patients with advanced HCC. However, the survival
advantage is only 2.8 months [2]. Therefore, enhancing
its efficacy or devising effective combination therapies
are urgently needed [16]. In this study, changes in amino
acid levels in miR122-silenced mouse liver tissues,
caused by impaired miR122 function, were first assessed.
Next, based on the results, chemoresistance of HCC
cells with impaired miR122 function against sorafenib
was determined. Finally, a comprehensive screen was
performed of chemical compounds that increased miR122
expression levels in HCC and that could alleviate the
observed resistance to sorafenib. From these results, we
proposed possible interventional methods for a subset of
HCCs with repressed miR122 levels.

arginine is an amino acid which is transported into cells
via SLC7A1 [26], a target of miR122, we focused on
the reproducibly increased arginine content of miR122silenced tissues, in subsequent studies.
To confirm the above screening results in vitro, we
used miR122-silenced Huh7 cells, well-differentiated
HCC cells which stably express miR122 antisense
constructs and have impaired miR122 function [5]
(Figure 2a). Huh7 cells were chosen for the experiments
using the antisense miR122 construct because they
have endogenously high miR122 expression levels
[27] and the effects of miR122-silecing are more easily
observed. Consistent with previous reports [27], luciferase
expression from a reporter construct containing the
3’ UTR of the SLC7A1 gene was increased, and SLC7A1
expression was increased by miR122-silecing (Figure
2b and 2c). Moreover, while intracellular levels of
phenylalanine did not change, intracellular arginine levels
increased significantly, confirming the initial screening
results (Figure 2d).
Arginine is an endogenous substrate for the
production of intracellular NO [28]. Intracellular NO
levels were elevated in miR122-silenced Huh7 cells
without deregulated NO synthetase expression (Figure 2e
and Supplementary Figure 2). Because NO has pleiotropic
effects in tumor cells such as chemotherapeutic resistance
and evasion of apoptosis [29–31], we focused on the
chemoresistance against sorafenib, the only systemic
treatment for HCC currently approved. As expected,
miR122-silenced cells showed more resistance to
sorafenib, determined by the number of the survival cells
after sorafenib treatment for 48 hrs (Figure 2e). These
effects appeared NO dependent, because the resistance
was canceled by the treatment of carboxy-PTIO, a potent
NO remover (Figure 2f). Because increased intracellular
NO synthesis is also a property of cancer-progenitor celllike features [30, 32–34], the expression levels of HCC
cancer-progenitor cell markers, such as EpCAM and CD13
[35] were examined, which were significantly increased in
miR122-silenced cells (Supplementary Figure 3). These
results suggested that miR122-silenced HCC cells were
more resistant to sorafenib because they contained higher
intracellular arginine and NO levels, possibly through
elevated expression of SLC7A1, an arginine transporter
and a target of miR122.

RESULTS
Intracellular arginine and NO levels were
increased in miR122-silenced HCC cells
Because SLC7A1 is a direct target of miR122
in vitro [17] and miR122 expression levels are frequently
decreased in HCC tissues [6, 18, 19], we first analyzed
the genome-wide mRNA and miRNA profiles of clinical
HCC tumors infected with chronic hepatitis B (n = 192)
and hepatitis C (n = 89) using the public data [20–23]
to determine the correlation in the expression levels of
between miR122 and SLC7A1 in clinical HCC samples.
Expression levels of miR122 and SLC7A1 were negatively
correlated, modestly but significantly, in both human
cohorts ( p < 0.001) (Supplementary Figure 1a and 1b).
Recently, metabolomic profiling has revealed a
number of perturbed metabolic pathways, including amino
acids, in cancers [24, 25]. To determine the biological
effects of impaired miR122 function on amino acid levels,
the latter were comprehensively quantified in miR122silenced mouse liver tissues [5]. Of the 20 amino acids
examined, arginine showed reproducible differences in
levels in between the control and miR122-silenced liver
tissues from two individuals per group (Figure 1). Because

Because intracellular arginine levels are largely
dependent on the transport of extracellular arginine
into cells [36], the effects of arginine depletion in the
culture media were examined. Although intracellular
arginine levels were increased in miR122-silenced
cells in the arginine-content media, this increase was

not seen when the cells were cultured under argininedepleted conditions (Figure 3a). Accordingly, culture
under arginine-depleted conditions prevented an
increase in intracellular NO, with levels similar to those
of the control cells treated with a NO remover (Figure
3b). In addition, because knockdown of SLC7A1 in
miR122-silenced cells through expression of shSLC7A1
also prevented an increase in intracellular NO, it was
considered that the increased NO levels in miR122silenced cells were due to increased SLC7A1 levels
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 3b). Concordantly, although we could not test
the effects of sorafenib under arginine-depleted media
because most cells died when maintained in serum-free
media (to remove the effects of arginine in serum) and
treated for 48 h with sorafenib, the expression levels of
HCC cancer-progenitor cell-markers were decreased by
arginine depletion (Supplementary Figure 3b). These
results showed that reduced intracellular arginine and
NO levels in miR122-silecend cells can be achieved by
the depletion of arginine in the extracellular media.

function was related to sorafenib resistance. These results
suggest that miR122-silenced HCC cells are more resistant
to chemotherapeutic drugs, and that depletion of arginine
in extracellular environments may be effective for the
clinical management of an HCC subset with reduced
miR122 expression levels.

To determine the converse effects, the miR122
precursor was stably expressed in Hep3B cells, because
these cells naturally expressed only minimal levels of
miR122 [5]. Hep3B cells expressing the miR122 precursor
showed enhanced miR122 function (Figure 4a) and
suppressed luciferase expression from a reporter carrying
the 3’ UTR of the SLC7A1 gene (Figure 4b), with lower
expression of SLC7A1 protein compared with the control
cells (Figure 4c). Furthermore, the cells showed lower
intracellular NO levels, similar to those of cells grown
under arginine-depleted culture conditions or treated
with PTIO (Figure 4d). Because stable overexpression
of SLC7A1 in the miR122 precursor-stably expressing
Hep3B cells reversed the effects of intracellular NO
contents, changes in intracellular NO levels appeared
dependent on changes in the SLC7A1 expression
levels (Figure 4d). It was noted that miR122 expression
had a positive effect on the sorafenib-treated Hep3B
cells, similar to the effects of removing NO with PTIO
(Figure 4e). To exclude any possible influences of
stable cell line specificity or differences in the culture
conditions of the individual cell lines, Huh7 or Hep3B
cells were transduced with miR122-silencing or miR122overexpressing lentiviruses with GFP, but without
selection. GFP-positive (miR122-silenced) Huh7 cells
and GFP-negative (miR122-non-overexpressing) Hep3B
cells were more concentrated after sorafenib treatment
of mixtures of infected (GFP-expressing) and noninfected (non-GFP-expressing) cells cultured in bulk
(Figure  4f  and  g), confirming that decreased miR122

Identification of chemical compounds that
enhanced miR122 expression levels
The results obtained led us to hypothesize that if
it were possible to enhance miR122 expression levels in
HCC cells using chemical compounds, such compounds
could augment the chemosensitivity of HCCs to sorafenib.
To undertake a comprehensive screen of possible
compounds, a knock-in reporter construct was created by
inserting a firefly luciferase gene in the miR122 precursor
genomic locus by genome-editing using the CRISPR-Cas9
system (Figure 5a and Supplementary Figure 4). These
cells were screened with over 1,200 chemical compounds
to identify molecules which potentially enhance miR122
pri-precursor transcription. Of several compounds that
increased the reporter values (Supplementary Table 1),
PD407824, a Wee1 kinase inhibitor, and Ellipticine, a
DNA topoisomerase inhibitor, returned the highest values.
Using Hep3B cells, which naturally express low
levels of miR122, the enhanced expression levels of
miR122 after treatment with PD407824 or Ellipticine
for 24 h were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR
(Figure 5b). Because the Wee1 kinase inhibitor was
recently reported as a potential novel HCC therapeutic
[37], our subsequent focus was on PD407824. SLC7A1
expression levels in Hep3B cells were suppressed by
PD407824, and this was reversed by the stable expression

of antisense miR122 construct (Figure 5c). Similarly,
the NO content in the cell lysate was downregulated
by PD407824, which was antagonized by the stable
expression of SLC7A1 or antisense miR122 construct
(Figure 5d). The number of Hep3B cells after combination
treatment of sorafenib and PD407824 was significantly
lower than that after sorafenib treatment alone (Figure 5e).
While PD407824 itself may have anti-oncogenic effects
on HCC cells [37], only marginal effects on Hep3B cell
survival were observed in our study, probably due to the
low concentration used (Figure 5e). The combinatorial
effects of PD407824 and sorafenib were antagonized by
the stable expression of SLC7A1 or the antisense miR122
construct (Figure 5e), suggesting that the synergistic
effects of PD407824 with sorafenib on Hep3B cells were
mediated by enhanced miR122 expression via PD407824.
These results suggested that the combination of PD407824
and sorafenib may act favorably against HCCs through
increasing miR122 expression levels.

expression of SLC7A1 and the subsequent metabolic
changes due to amino acid imbalances.
L-arginine is the natural substrate of NO synthetase
for the generation of NO [28, 36]. The availability of
intracellular arginine is a rate-limiting factor in cellular NO
production [44]. Despite the “arginine paradox”, in which
extracellular and intracellular arginine concentrations may
differ [36], CAT systems rely largely on concentrationdependent stimulation of transport by substrates on the
opposite site of the membrane. Among CATs, CAT1
(SLC7A1) is the highest-affinity carrier of cationic amino
acids, particularly L-arginine [43]. Thus, the increased
expression of SLC7A1 may lead to increased intracellular
arginine levels and subsequent NO production. Increased
intracellular NO synthesis may function in a cellautonomous manner in maintaining the cancer progenitorcell properties, as was discovered recently in glioma [30].
In fact, human breast cancer cell lines were reported to
promote cell survival through arginine-uptake via CAT1
expression [45]. Other reports suggest that endogenously
produced NO is generally cytoprotective [46, 47].
Therefore, depletion of NO by blocking the related
pathway, for example by NO removal, NOS inhibition,
modulation of SLC7A1 expression, or arginine depletion,
may have therapeutic effects on HCCs.
Another important finding of this study was
the identification of those compounds that enhanced
transcription of the miR122 precursor. Although the
molecular mechanisms of how those compounds enhanced
the miR122 precursor transcription remain unclear,
combination therapy with sorafenib may provide a
promising approach to the treatment of resistance in HCC
by enhancing miR122 expression and reducing SLC7A1
levels. In addition, the compounds identified also possess
anti-cancer properties at appropriate doses, irrespective
of the effects of increased miR122 expression levels,
which may also be beneficial for the treatment of HCCs
in combination with sorafenib. Because these experiments
are performed in in vitro studies using two kinds of HCC
cell lines in this study, it is important to test other cell lines
and also in vivo experiments in the future for the future
clinical application of these findings.
Arginine deprivation using pegylated arginine
deiminase is currently undergoing a phase 3 trial for HCC
and melanoma [48–51]. This clinical trial is based on the
fact that tumor cells cannot grow in media depleted of
arginine [52]. Our results may provide a basic rationale
for HCC treatments targeting arginine, especially in the
presence of reduced miR122 expression. Given the series
of failures of recent phase 3 trials of various moleculartargeted agents in HCC due to the lack of predictive
biomarkers of a response, our results show promise for
the development of personalized/stratified HCC therapy.
In summary, we have shown that decreased miR122
expression in HCC leads to increased intracellular arginine
and NO levels through elevated SLC7A1 expression,

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that miR122-silenced
HCC cells and tissues have higher SLC7A1 expression,
intracellular arginine, and NO contents, which may be
linked to the sorafenib chemosensitivity, consistent with
the previous reports that miR122 is linked with sorafenib
sensitivity in HCC cells [38, 39].
A liver-specific miRNA, miR122, has been linked
with pleiotropic physiological functions [14]. Notably,
a remarkable decrease in the expression of this miRNA
in HCCs is well documented and may play a crucial
role in maintaining tumorigenic properties [4]. Recently,
it is known that amino acid profiles are changed in
cancers [40, 41]. Thus, to gain insights regarding the
physiological effects on amino acid metabolism induced
by miR122 silencing, changes in amino acid levels
in miR122-silenced liver tissues were determined in
this study. From the results of the initial screening, we
focused on the increased intracellular arginine content
with miR122 silencing, because SLC7A1, a well-known
target of miR122 [27], is the transporter for arginine and
the increased arginine levels were explained by changes in
the expression levels of this gene.
SLC7A1, the first amino acid transporter for
arginine to be cloned among CATs, has important
metabolic functions, including in NO synthesis.
Homozygous SLC7A1-knockout mice die on the first day
after birth [42], suggesting an important physiological role
for SLC7A1 by mediation of the basic arginine supply
[43]. Interestingly, although SLC7A1 is expressed almost
ubiquitously, its expression is absent in the adult normal
liver [43], possibly because of high miR122 levels in the
healthy liver. Therefore, it is possible that the decreased
expression of miR122 in the liver in pathological states
such as HCC may cause the abnormally increased

which may be involved in chemoresistance. Our results
suggest that deprivation of arginine or combination of
sorafenib and miR122 expression-enhancing drugs may
be useful in the management of a subset of HCCs with
reduced miR122 expression levels.

Liver tissues from two control C57BL/6 mice and
from two miR122-silenced transgenic mice were subjected
to comprehensive analyses of amino acid levels, as
described previously [53]. Briefly, pre-weighed, snap-frozen
tissues were homogenized using a cell disrupter (MS100R; TOMY, Tokyo, Japan) at 2°C after adding 500 μL
of methanol containing internal standards [methionine
sulfone, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES),
and D-camphol-10-sulfonic acid (CSA), 20 μM each].
The homogenate was then mixed with 20 μL of Milli-Q
water and 500 μL of chloroform and centrifuged at 4,600
g for 15 min at 4°C. Subsequently, 300 μL of the aqueous
solution were centrifugally filtered through a 5-kDa cutoff filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) to remove any
proteins. The filtrate was centrifugally concentrated and
dissolved in 50 μL of Milli-Q water containing reference
compounds (3-aminopyrrolidine and trimesate, 200 μM
each) immediately prior to capillary electrophoresis timeof-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) analysis.
Cationic amino acids were separated in a fused-silica
capillary (i.d. 50 μm, total length 100 cm) filled with 1 M
formic acid as the reference electrolyte [54]. Sheath liquid
comprising methanol/water (50%/50%, v/v) and 0.5 μM
reserpine was administered at 10 μL/min. The ESI-TOFMS
was operated in positive ion mode. Separation of anionic
amino acids was performed in a cationic polymer-coated
SMILE (+) capillary (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) filled
with 50 mM ammonium acetate solution (pH 8.5) [55].
The sample solution was injected at 50 mbar for 30 s, and a
negative voltage of −30 kV was applied. Ammonium acetate
(5 mM) in methanol/water (50%/50%, v/v) containing 1 μM
reserpine was administered as the sheath liquid at 10 μL/
min. The ESI-TOFMS was operated in negative ion mode.
Other conditions were as described previously [53]. For
the quantitation of the amino acids in cultured cells, cells
were washed with PBS and lysed with an 8:2 methanol:
water solution. Chloroform was then added and the mixture
was centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was stored
at −80°C until analysis. Intracellular amino acids (arginine
and phenylalanine) in the cell lysates were quantified as
described previously [56].

(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
unless otherwise specified.

Mouse experiments
MiR122 functionally silenced transgenic C57BL/6
mice which expressed antisense miR122 oligonucleotides
under the control of the H1 promoter were described in
detail in our previous study [5]. Mouse experimental
protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee for
Animal Experimentation at the University of Tokyo
(#13-P-54), and experiments were conducted in
accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of
laboratory animals of the University of Tokyo.

Reagents and arginine-depleted media
2-(4-Carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline1-oxyl-3-oxide [carboxy-PTIO, a stable and potent NO
scavenger] was purchased from Dojindo Laboratories
(Kumamoto, Japan). Arginine-depleted DMEM was specially
formulated and provided by Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals
(Tokyo, Japan). Fetal bovine serum was not added when
using this medium. Sorafenib was purchased from Toronto
Research Chemicals (North York, ON, Canada), and
dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a 5 mM stock.
An equal volume of DMSO was used as the negative control.
PD407824, a Wee1 and Chk1 inhibitor, and Ellipticine, a
DNA topoisomerase inhibitor, were purchased from TOCRIS
Bioscience (Bristol, UK) and used at 1 μM.

Western blotting, transfection, and dual
luciferase assays

Antibodies

Western blotting, transfection and dual luciferase
assays were performed as described previously [5].
Briefly, protein lysates were prepared from cells for
Western blotting. Proteins were separated by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking
with 5% dry milk to decrease non-specific binding, the
membranes were probed with the appropriate primary
antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies were used to detect primary antibodies. Bound

The antibodies used included anti-CAT1 (ab37588),
purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and antiEpCAM (#2929), anti-iNOS (#2977), anti-eNOS (#9572),
and anti-nNOS (#4234), all purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Anti-CD13 (#301701)
was purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA).
Anti-β-actin (#A5441) was purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO, USA). Isotype IgG antibodies were purchased
from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

antibodies were detected using ECL Plus Western Blotting
Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Pittsburgh, PA). All plasmid transfections were performed
using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Boehringer
Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. pGL4-TK, a control plasmid
containing Renilla reniformis (sea pansy) luciferase
under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine
kinase promoter (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) was used to
determine the transfection efficiency. Relative luciferase
values were calculated by normalizing firefly luciferase
activity values to sea pansy luciferase activity values to
account for changes in transfection efficiency. Luciferase
activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with a
luminometer (Lumat LB9507; EG&G Berthold, Bad
Wildbad, Germany).

lentiviral particles were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). The pCDH control vector
(System Biosciences) was used as a negative control.
Lentiviral particles were produced using a pPACKH1
lentivector packaging plasmid mix, according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations (System Biosciences).
Cells were transduced with lentiviruses using polybrene
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and then selected
with puromycin, unless otherwise specified.

Compound screening
To screen those chemical compounds that had the
potential to increase miR122 precursor transcription,
knock-in reporter cells were prepared using the CRISPR/
Cas9 gene editing system. The targeting site by the
guide RNA with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)
sequences at the 11 bases upstream of miR122 precursor
lesions was determined using the CRISPRdirect database
(http://crispr.dbcls.jp/). The target sequences AGG TGA
AGT TAA CAC CTT CGT GG were cloned into the
Cas9 SmartNulcease tagged vector (System Biosciences),
which expressed the guide RNA under the H1 promoter
and humanized Cas9 under the CAG promoter from
a single vector. For the donor construct, the firefly
luciferase gene was amplified by PCR using the pGL4.50
vector (Promega) as a template and inserted and fused
to the original eGFP gene at the Bsp1407I site of the
HR180PA-1 targeting vector (System Biosciences) by the
Infusion method, to construct a luciferase-based reporter
donor vector. Approximately 1,600-base-pair sequences
around the Cas9 targeting site were inserted before and
after the reporter construct as 5’ and 3’ homology arms,
respectively. Because this construct has a promoter-less
IRES element upstream of the eGFP and firefly luciferase
gene, eGFP and luciferase mRNA were transcribed by
the host gene promoter at the knock-in locus, and the
proteins were translated from the IRES. Thus, the reporter
expression levels reflected the transcription levels of the
miR122 pri-precursor lesion. Since this donor vector
also contained a puromycin-resistance gene driven by
an independent EF1 promoter between the 5’ and 3’
homology arms, the cells containing the successfully
edited gene could be selected by puromycin. Because
293T cells also express miR122 [57] and these cells
were efficient at gene-editing, the above Cas9 expressing
construct and the donor vector were transfected into 293T
cells and selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin; subsequently
12 colonies were picked up. Genomic DNA was extracted
from the colonies and the correct knock-in was confirmed
by the 5’ and 3’ junction PCR method. The genomes of the
cells from all colonies picked up were edited successfully.
A chemical compound library (LOPAC1280)
containing 1,280 compounds was purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). Reporter knocked-in cells
were seeded in 96-well plates and 1 μM of compounds

Plasmids, virus production, and transduction
The firefly luciferase-based reporter carrying a
miR122-responsive element in its 3’ untranslated region
(UTR), used to examine miR122 function, and the
internal control Renilla luciferase-based plasmids have
been described previously [5]. A Renilla luciferasebased reporter constructed with the SLC7A1 3’UTR,
which contains three miR122 responsive elements,
was kindly provided by Prof. Filipowicz [27]. When
using this construct, the CMV promoter-driven firefly
luciferase construct (Promega) was used as an internal
control. The miR122 precursor in the eGFP-expressing
plasmid (pCDH-miR122 with eGFP) and the H1
promoter-driven antisense miR122 stem-loop-stem RNAexpressing plasmid (pmiRZIP122 with eGFP) were
purchased from System Biosciences (Mountain View,
CA, USA). The miR122 precursor-expressing plasmid
with the puromycin resistance gene (pCDH-miR122
with puro), which was constructed by replacing the
eGFP gene with the puromycin resistance gene via the
FseI site, was constructed as described previously [5].
pmiRZIP122 without the eGFP gene (pmiRZIP122 with
puro) for miR122 silencing was constructed by excision
of the eGFP-coding sequences via the Xba I and Pst I
sites, followed by ligating the cut ends annealed with
oligonucleotides (5′-CTA GAC GCC ACC ATG CTG CA3′ and 5′-GCA TGG CGT-3′) to maintain the expression of
the downstream puromycin resistance gene. An HA-tagged
SLC7A1-expressing a lentiviral construct (pCDH-HASLC7A1) was made by an infusion technique (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA) by inserting a PCR-amplified HAtagged SLC7A1 cDNA using a Halo-tagged SLC7A1expressing vector purchased from Promega (FHC24970
clone) as the template. The primers used were 5′-ATG TTC
CAG ATT ACG CTA TGG GGT GCA AAG TGG TGC
TC-3′ and 5′-TTA AAC CTT GCA CTG GTC CAA GT3′. SLC7A1 knockdown construct shSLC7A1-expressing

in DMSO were added for 24 h. Luciferase values were
measured by a GLOMAX 96-well microplate luminometer
(Promega) and relative values were calculated by adjusting
the average values from the DMSO-treated control cells in
eight wells in each plate as 1.0.

(caa aca cca ttg tca cac tcc a), which had previously been
heated to 95°C for 2 min. Membranes were washed at
42°C in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and the bound
probe was visualized using a BrightStar BioDetect Kit
(Ambion). Blots were stripped by boiling in a solution
containing 0.1% SDS and 5 mM EDTA for 10 min
prior to rehybridization with a U6 probe (cac gaa ttt
gcg tgt cat cct t). To measure the amount of miR122 in
the cells, a miRCURY LNA microRNA qPCR system
(Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The levels of U6 snRNA were
used for normalization of cellular miRNA levels.

Flow cytometry
Cells were hybridized with the primary antibody or
the isotype control IgG in 5% BSA/1% sodium azide/PBS
for 1 h at 4°C. After washing, the cells were incubated with
a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (1:1000;
Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for 30 min. Flow
cytometry was performed and the data analyzed using
Guava EasyCyte Plus (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont,
UK), as described previously [58].

Analysis of clinical HCC cohorts
To determine the clinical relevance of miR122
deregulation on SLC7A1 expression, previously generated
genome-wide mRNA and miRNA profiles of a hepatitis
B-related HCC cohort (n = 192) [20, 21] and a hepatitis
C-related HCC cohort (n = 89) [22, 23] (NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus; accession numbers GSE6857,
GSE14520, GSE20594, and GSE9843) were analyzed.
Pre-normalized data in the respective publications were
summarized by calculating the median of multiple probes
corresponding to the SLC7A1 gene.

Cell counting and NO quantitation
Relative cell proliferation was assessed using the
Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Laboratories) as described
previously [5]. For drug testing, relative cell numbers
were counted after treatment for 48 h either with sorafenib
(5 μM), with PD407824 (1 μM), with Ellipticine (1 μM)
or with combinations thereof. The cell numbers were
calculated by comparison to the control cells treated with
DMSO. NO quantitation in the cell lysate from cells
treated with arginine-depletion, PTIO treatment, or other
compound treatments for 24 h was performed using the
QuantiChrom Nitric Oxide Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems,
Hayward, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Statistical analysis
Statistically significant differences between groups
were identified using Welch’s t-test. P values less than
0.05 for in vitro experiments were considered to indicate
statistical significance. The correlation between SLC7A1
and miR122 expression levels was assessed by Spearman
correlation tests.

Fluorescence microscopy

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

To observe GFP expression, cells were transferred
to a Lab-Tek chamber and mounted with Vectashield
containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,
USA). Cells were observed before and after sorafenib
treatment using a fluoromicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan).
