Abstract
Hypoxic signaling is a central modulator of cellular physiology in cancer. Core members of oxygen-sensing
pathway including the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) and the hypoxia inducible factor
(HIF) transcription factors have been intensively studied, but improved organismal models might speed advances
for both pathobiologic understanding and therapeutic modulation. To study HIF signaling during tumorigenesis
and development in zebraﬁsh, we developed a unique in vivo reporter for hypoxia, expressing EGFP driven by
prolyl hydroxylase 3 (phd3) promoter/regulatory elements. Modulation of HIF pathway in Tg(phd3::EGFP)
embryos showed a speciﬁc role for hypoxic signaling in the transgene activation. Zebraﬁsh vhl mutants display
a systemic hypoxia response, reﬂected by strong and ubiquitous transgene expression. In contrast to human VHL
patients, heterozygous Vhl mice and vhl zebraﬁsh are not predisposed to cancer. However, upon exposure to
dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), the vhl heterozygous ﬁsh showed an increase in the occurrence of hepatic and
intestinal tumors, a subset of which exhibited strong transgene expression, suggesting loss of Vhl function in these
tumor cells. Compared with control ﬁsh, DMBA-treated vhl heterozygous ﬁsh also showed an increase in
proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive renal tubules. Taken together, our ﬁndings establish Vhl as a genuine
tumor suppressor in zebraﬁsh and offer this model as a tool to noninvasively study VHL and HIF signaling during
tumorigenesis and development. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4017–27. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Oxygen homeostasis, a physiologic process essential and
critical for the normal development and functioning of an
organism, requires coordinate regulation of multiple pathways. Reduction in the normal level of oxygen tension in
tissues (hypoxia) is observed in a range of disease conditions,
including locally in peripheral vascular disease, myocardial
infarction and stroke, and systemically in pulmonary disease.
In addition, hypoxia is a well-described feature of tumor
microenvironment. Intratumoral hypoxia is elicited by uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells coupled with aberrant
growth of tumor vasculature. Under hypoxic conditions 2

distinct mechanisms are activated, which promote cell/tissue
survival in low oxygen environments and enhance oxygen
delivery to the hypoxic sites. These adaptive responses to
hypoxia are induced by a key transcription factor, hypoxia
inducible factor (HIF), whose activity is regulated by the
availability of oxygen (1). HIF is a heterodimeric protein
complex consisting of basic helix-loop-helix Per/Arnt/Sim
(PAS) domain containing a and b subunits (HIFa and HIFb).
HIF plays a crucial role in altering the cellular metabolism of
tumors to thrive under hypoxic conditions and in facilitating
malignant transformation of tumors (2). Several HIF target
genes such as VEGF, PDGF, TGF, CXCR4, TGF-a, and MMP-1
play important roles in the development of cancer (3–5) and
signiﬁcant correlations have been observed between
increased HIF-1a levels and patient mortality in many types
of cancer (6).
The stability of HIF is regulated in an oxygen-dependent
mechanism by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). pVHL is encoded by VHL whose biallelic loss lead
to the development of a hereditary cancer syndrome involving
multiple hemangioblastomas of CNS, clear cell renal carcinoma and pheochromocytoma (7), which occur when heterozygosity is lost either by mutation on the second allele of VHL or
via epigenetic silencing (8). pVHL is an essential component of
the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and interacts with the HIFa
subunit under normoxic conditions, targeting them for proteasomal degradation. The pVHL–HIFa interaction requires
oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of either of 2 conserved prolyl

residues (Pro402 and Pro564) within the oxygen-dependent
degradation (ODD) domain of HIFa by prolyl hydroxylase
domain (PHD) enzymes (9–12).
HIF prolyl hydroxylases belong to the 2OG-dependent
dioxygenase superfamily (13), which also require molecular
oxygen as a cosubstrate for their catalysis resulting in the
contribution of one oxygen atom for the hydroxylation reaction and the second oxygen atom toward the oxidative
decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate yielding succinate and
CO2. Prolyl hydroxylation of HIFa generates a binding site
for pVHL leading to polyubiquitination of HIFa and subsequent hydrolysis. As oxygen tension decreases below the
critical threshold, prolyl hydroxylases become quiescent,
allowing HIFa to stabilize and migrate into the nucleus to
form a functional transcription complex by binding with HIFb
subunit. Thus, PHD enzymes play a critical role in transducing the physiological signal of hypoxia to the nucleus (14–
17). In vertebrates, there are 3 prolyl hydroxylase (PHD1,
PHD2, and PHD3) isoforms capable of hydroxylating HIFa.
Interestingly, the PHD2 and PHD3 genes are also HIF target
genes, providing negative feedback and thus a mechanism to
create a ﬂexible threshold for activation of the HIF signaling
pathway (17, 18).
By negatively regulating HIFs, pVHL plays an important role
in the adaptive cellular response to hypoxia. Constitutive
stabilization of HIFa subunits and enrichment of PHD transcripts have been observed in the VHL-deﬁcient renal carcinoma cells under normoxic conditions (19, 20). We reported
earlier the identiﬁcation of 2 mutant lines carrying null mutations in the zebraﬁsh vhl ortholog. The mutant embryos exhibit
a general systemic hypoxic response with upregulation of
genes involved in oxygen sensing and transport, angiogenesis,
anaerobic energy metabolism, and display key features of the
human VHL-associated disorder "Chuvash polycythemia" (21,
22). The vhl mutants also displayed a very strong upregulation
of prolyl hydroxylase 3 (phd3) gene expression at various stages
(21), suggesting phd3 as an ideal candidate for the readout of
Hif activity. We characterized phd3 as a suitable response gene
and created a Tg(phd3::EGFP) hypoxia reporter line and
describe the utility of this transgene as an in vivo marker for
intratumoral hypoxic regions in a zebraﬁsh melanoma model
system.
In zebraﬁsh, the effects of vhl heterozygosity on tumor
formation have not been analyzed in detail, but such ﬁsh are
generally healthy and fail to show indications of increased
susceptibility to tumor formation. Using the Tg(phd3::EGFP)
reporter line as a tool we assayed the frequency of LOH in the
vhl ﬁsh. However, the late average age of diagnosis of ccRCC in
human VHL patients suggests that several additional changes
are required to turn a VHL LOH cell into a cancer cell, thus the
short lifespan of the ﬁsh may prevent development of renal
cancer. We therefore sought to test their susceptibility when
challenged with a wide-spectrum zebraﬁsh carcinogen; 7,12Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA; ref. 23). We report here
strong susceptibility of the DMBA-treated vhlþ/ ﬁsh to hepatic and intestinal tumorigenesis, showing for the ﬁrst time that
Vhl functions as a tumor suppressor in zebraﬁsh. The treatment also led to an increased occurrence of proliferating renal

tubules compared with appropriate control ﬁsh. Our observations establish that the Tg(phd3::EGFP) line provide a novel in
vivo tool to monitor Vhl/Hif/hypoxic signaling under tumor
pathologic conditions.

Materials and Methods
Zebraﬁsh
Zebraﬁsh (Danio rerio) strains were maintained on 14-/10hour light/dark cycle at 28 C in a UK Home Ofﬁce approved
aquarium facility at the University of Shefﬁeld. The ﬁsh embryos were staged according to hours or days postfertilization (hpf
or dpf; ref. 24).
We have utilized 2 different vhl mutant lines namely,
vhlhu2117/þ and vhlhu2081/þ, previously identiﬁed and described
(21).
phd3::EGFP transgenesis
A EGFP-SV40pA-FRT-Kn-FRT recombineering cassette and
red recombineering system in EL250 cells were used to insert
EGFP with an SV40 polyadenylation site at the phd3 ATG start
site in BAC clone CHORI73-277E22. This modiﬁed BAC was
used to generate stable transgenic lines according to published
protocols (25). We selected 2 different lines namely, Tg(phd3::
EGFP)i144/þ and Tg(phd3::EGFP)i146/þ with the i144 exhibiting a
stronger expression. All the experiments in this study were
conducted on the i144 line.
We have observed phd3 transgene activation phenotype in the 2 different vhl mutant allele backgrounds
viz. vhlhu2117/hu2117 and vhlhu2081/hu2081 as well as in the
vhlhu2081/hu2117 transheterozygous embryos.
Hypoxia chamber assay
The embryos were raised in E3 medium in a 5% oxygen
supplied sealed chamber (INVIVO2 200; Ruskinn Technology
Ltd.) for stipulated periods of time. The chamber was deoxygenized by positive infusion of 5% CO2/95% N2 gas mixture
with >90% relative humidity at 28 C. The continuous O2
saturation and the pressure inside hypoxia chamber were
maintained during the course of the experiment. The transgenic embryos raised under similar conditions in a wellaerated bag inside the chamber served as controls.
vhl morpholino and mRNA injections
A splice blocking antisense morpholino (Genetools)
sequence, namely 50 -GCATAATTTCACGAACCCACAAAAG30 , designed to the exon1 splice-donor site of the vhl gene
was utilized to perturb its function. The morpholino stock
solution (10 mg/mL) was diluted appropriately in distilled
H2O and the 1-cell stage transgenic embryos were injected
with 3 ng per embryo. Full-length zebraﬁsh vhl gene was
subcloned into the pCS2þ expression vector. mRNA from
the sequence veriﬁed constructs was transcribed in vitro
after NotI linearization, using SP6 mMESSAGE Kit (Applied
Biosystems). Dominant active and dominant negative forms
of hif-1aa and hif-1ab were synthesized and injected as
previously described (26). For the rescue experiments, 6.5
pg vhl mRNA was injected.

Tumors in vhl Zebraﬁsh and a Novel Reporter for HIF Signaling

Dimethyloxaloylglycine treatment
The 3-dpf wild-type transgenic embryos were treated
with 100-mmol/L dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG; Frontier
Scientiﬁc) or 0.1% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich)
for 1 to 2 days as previously described (21).
RNA in situ hybridization
Whole-mount in situ hybridization was conducted as per
standard protocols (27). The phd3 (BC066699) antisense digoxygenin-UTP labeled mRNA probe was synthesized from an
expressed sequence tag (EST) clone (RZPD/Imagenes; ref. 21)
and the in situ data were collected on a Zeiss Axioplan with a
5 or 20 objective using a Spot4 digital camera.
7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene treatment of vhlþ/
ﬁsh
Wild-type and vhlhu2117/þ fry at 3 weeks of age were
immersed overnight in aquarium water containing 5 ppm of
DMBA (Sigma-Aldrich-Chemie BV) dissolved in DMSO (23).
The next day, all fry were rinsed several times in regular
aquarium water and subsequently were returned to the aquarium. Fish were carefully grown and regularly monitored for
signs of sickness or evidence of tumor formation. Eventually all
ﬁsh were culled for analysis at 14 months after the DMBA
treatment.
Histology and immunostaining
Adult ﬁsh were euthanized, culled, and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 to 4 days at 4 C. The samples were decalciﬁed
in 0.25M EDTA pH 8 for 2 to 4 days at room temperature,
embedded in parafﬁn, and 5-mm sections were made. For
immunostaining, the primary antibodies mouse monoclonal
anti-PCNA (1:1,000; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1a
(1:100; ref. 28) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (1:250; Torrey
Pines Biolabs) were used. The stained sections were viewed in a
Leica DM 2500 microscope and photographed using Leica DFC
420C digital camera. All the tumor sections were observed and
analyzed by a clinical pathologist.
Western blot analysis
After the hypoxia exposure treatment, the embryos were
harvested in the hypoxic E3 medium itself and protease
inhibitor MG132 was added (25 mmol/L ﬁnal concentration)
to prevent proteasomal degradation of Hif-1a protein. The
samples were processed as per standard protocols and the
antibodies used were anti-Hif-1a (1:500; ref. 28) and antiacetylated tubulin (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Real-time RT-PCR was conducted on a BioRad MyiQ
machine along with BioRad iQ SYBER Green Supermix according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of the
primers used in the study are as follows: vegf A: F—CAGTGTGAGCCTTGCTGTTC, R—CCATAGGCCTCCTGTCATTT; phd
3: F—CGCTGCGTCACCTGTATT, R—TAGCATACGACGGCTGAACT; vhl: F—ATGTCGGCTGTCTGGAGATT, R—GATGCACAGGTGTGCTCAGT; b-actin: F—GCAGAAGGAGATCACATCCCTGGC, R—CATTGCCGTCACCTTCACCGTTC. The

www.aacrjournals.org

primers were optimized using a standard curve of wild-type
cDNA. The cycling conditions of the PCR program were as
follows: step 1: 95 C  1 minutes; step 2: 40 cycles of the
following 95 C  30 seconds, 60 C  30 seconds, 72 C  30
seconds; step 3: 95 C  30 seconds; step 4: 60 C  30 seconds;
step 5: 40 cycles of 55 C  10 seconds. The data were analyzed
using the DDCt method (29).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis and the P-value calculations were done
using Chi-square test (30).

Results
phd3 as a potential hypoxia/Hif target gene
In microarray expression analyses of 7 dpf vhlhu2117/hu2081
transheterozygous and 3.5 dpf vhlhu2117/hu2117 homozygous
mutant and vhlþ/þ sibling larvae, we observed upregulation
of several Hif target genes, including epo, vegf, phd1-3 in the
mutants, with phd3 consistently exhibiting the strongest
increase overall (e.g., 23-fold at 7 dpf) (21, FvE unpubl.). When
we did Western blot analysis of vhl/ embryos using Hif-1a
antibody, we observed strong deposition of Hif-1a in the
mutants (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, when we conducted qPCR
on 3.5 dpf vhl/ mutant embryos, we observed 216-fold
increase in phd3 expression in mutant embryos compared
with wild types (Fig. 1B). In comparison, the classical HIF target
vegf-a was increased 7-fold (Fig. 1B) in the mutants. To identify
the earliest developmental time point at which phd3 expression is stimulated in the vhl/ mutant embryos, we conducted
whole mount in situ hybridization on selected stages of mutant
and sibling embryos. In wild-type embryos, phd3 expression
could only be weakly detected in the brain around 30 hpf (data
not shown). By 48 hpf, the expression became restricted to a
population of cells in the tectum and midbrain–hindbrain
boundary (MHB) region and the wild-type ﬁsh continued to
preserve this conﬁned phd3 expression pattern during the
subsequent embryonic and larval development (Fig. 1C and
E and Supplementary Fig. S1A). In contrast, vhl mutant embryos exhibited strong phd3 expression as early as 21.5 hpf (25somite stage) in the brain and pronephros (Fig. 1D), suggesting
an induction in Hif activity. By 36 hpf, the mutant embryos
showed strong phd3 expression in the heart and other visceral
organs indicating a systemic response. These embryos continued to exhibit robust expression of the phd3 gene all through
their embryonic (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S1B) and
larval development, until their death at 10 to 12 dpf. Presence
of wild-type maternal vhl mRNA and Vhl protein during the
early embryonic stages in mutant embryos (21), might explain
the delay in the activation of phd3 expression until 21 to 22
hpf. These observations suggested that, although the physiologic and behavioral responses of vhl mutants only become
evident by 3 dpf, the molecular onset of the hypoxic response
can be detected from approx. 22 hpf.

In the human PHD3 gene, a hypoxia response element (HRE)
was identiﬁed in the ﬁrst intron, but its conservation in ﬁsh is

used in all subsequent experiments.
In wild-type embryos, similar to phd3 in situ staining, phd3::
EGFP transgene-mediated EGFP ﬂuorescence commenced
weakly in the brain and spinal cord from 30 hpf (data not
shown). The transgene expression became restricted to MHB
region by around 60 hpf and the EGFP ﬂuorescence was found
to adhere to this region during subsequent stages of development (Fig. 1G). In contrast, the vhl mutant embryos commenced transgene expression from 25-somite stage onward in
the brain, spinal cord, and pronephros (data not shown).
Subsequently, the mutants began exhibiting strong induction
of the transgene in several other organs like the heart, pectoral
ﬁns, pancreas, and the hatching gland (Fig. 1H). In situ hybridizations for gfp mRNA on phd3::EGFP transgenic embryos
correlated well with the endogenous phd3 expression at various stages of development (Supplementary Fig. S2). We also
quantiﬁed and compared the level of EGFP ﬂuorescence
between the vhl mutants and wild-type siblings at 4 dpf, and
found a 3-fold increase in the amount of ﬂuorescence in the
mutants (Supplementary Table S1).

utilized a recombineering strategy to insert an EGFP with an
SV40 30 UTR at the phd3 ATG start site in the BAC clone
CHORI73-277E22. This BAC contains the complete phd3 gene
in a large genomic context (>25 Kb 50 and >90 Kb 30 ). The phd3
start codon was destroyed by the recombination thus preventing the transgene construct from interfering itself with the
hypoxic signaling pathway. This modiﬁed BAC was injected to

vhl mRNA rescues phd3::EGFP activation in vhl knockout
and knockdown embryos
To prove that phd3::EGFP activation observed in the vhl
mutant embryos is speciﬁcally affected by the loss of Vhl
function, we tried to rescue this phenotype by injecting 6 pg
of capped vhl mRNA into single-cell stage embryos. By around
28 hpf, both the uninjected and injected wild-type embryos
showed no activation of the phd3::EGFP transgene. But while
the uninjected vhl mutants exhibited strong expression of the
transgene at 28 hpf, the mRNA-injected mutant embryos
exhibited no EGFP ﬂuorescence at the identical time point
(Fig. 2A).
We also stimulated phd3::EGFP expression in the wildtype embryos by knocking down vhl function using antisense
morpholino oligonucleotides. Injection of vhl splice morpholino into 1-cell stage Tg(phd3::EGFP)i144/þ embryos led to
strong induction of the transgene from 60 hpf onward and
morphant embryos continued to display strong EGFP ﬂuorescence until 120 hpf. But when we injected vhl morpholino and
vhl mRNA together, persistence of wild-type expression pattern was observed during embryonic and larval development
(Fig. 2B), suggesting a complete rescue of the morphant
phenotype.
phd3::EGFP activation is Hif dependent
Our observations suggest that loss of function mutations in
vhl can activate phd3::GFP reporter gene expression possibly
through the stabilization of Hifa subunit but Vhl protein is
reported to have numerous noncanonical functions as well
(32). To verify the role of Hif transcription factor in eliciting
transgene expression in vhl/ embryos, we generated dominant active (DA) forms of Hif-1aa and Hif-1ab by mutating the
conserved proline and asparagine hydroxylation sites of Phd
and Fih hydroxylases, respectively (26). When the DA hif-1aa
and hif-1ab mRNAs were coinjected into 1-cell stage Tg(phd3::
EGFP)i144/þ embryos, we observed activation of the transgene

Tumors in vhl Zebraﬁsh and a Novel Reporter for HIF Signaling

Figure 2. vhl mRNA rescues vhl mutant and morphant phenotypes and Hif mediates phd3::EGFP transgene activation. A, embryos obtained from Tg(phd3::
i144/þ
; vhlþ/ parents were injected with full-length vhl mRNA at the 1-cell stage and the injected embryos were raised individually in 24-well plates. At
EGFP)
28 hpf, although the uninjected vhl/ mutant embryos showed strong phd3::EGFP mediated EGFP ﬂuorescence, none of the vhl mRNA-injected embryos
showed activation of transgene expression. Genotypes of the experimental embryos were known by culling the embryos at 96 hpf and performing molecular
genotyping assay. B, Tg (phd3::EGFP)i144/þ embryos were injected with vhl splice morpholino (MO) at the 1-cell stage. At 60 hpf, although the uninjected
embryos showed EGFP ﬂuorescence only in the MHB region, the morpholino-injected embryos showed strong induction of transgene-mediated EGFP
ﬂuorescence. When the vhl morpholino and vhl mRNA were coinjected into 1-cell stage Tg (phd3::EGFP)i144/þ embryos, the injected embryos exhibited no
transgene activation, showing rescue of the morpholino-induced phenotype. C, Tg(phd3::EGFP)i144/þ embryos coinjected with DA isoforms of hif-1aa
and hif-1ab mRNAs at 1-cell stage led to the enhancement of phd3::EGFP mediated EGFP ﬂuorescence in the transgenic embryos by around 48 hpf. The
injection of wild-type isoforms of hif-1aa and hif-1ab mRNAs into Tg(phd3::EGFP)i144/þ embryos however did not induce transgene expression.

in the injected embryos from 24 hpf, as evidenced by strong
EGFP ﬂuorescence, mainly in the brain and CNS. The enhanced
phd3::EGFP expression persisted in the larvae expressing DA
Hif-1a isoforms until at least 48 hpf (Fig. 2C). When the same
amount of wild-type hif-1aa and hif-1ab mRNAs were injected
this level of phd3::EGFP expression was not observed, conﬁrming that the DA versions of hif-1a have successfully stabilized
the protein. These observations clearly show the direct role of
Hif-1a transcription factor in mediating the phd3::EGFP transgene activation (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Chemical activation of Hif signaling in wild-type
embryos induces phd3::EGFP expression
To further extend this observation, we activated Hif in the
wild-type transgenic embryos by inhibiting Phd/factor inhibiting Hif (Fih) functions using the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor
DMOG, and thus preventing the degradation of the Hifa
subunit even in the presence of functional Vhl. Transgenic
wild-type embryos at 2.5 dpf were treated with 100 mmol/L
DMOG for 2 days displayed an increase in phd3::EGFP expression in the pronephros, gall bladder, liver, and brain (Supplementary Fig. S4A) compared with very mild expression of

os. Hif activity and hence the transgene induction were
observed to be restricted to selected tissues/cells of DMOGtreated embryos, because limitations in the mode and timing of
the treatment (21). When mRNAs encoding DN forms of hif1aa and hif-1ab (26) were injected into Tg(phd3::EGFP)i144/þ
embryos and subsequently treated with DMOG at 24 hpf, we
could block the DMOG-mediated induction in EGFP ﬂuorescence at 48 hpf (Supplementary Figs. S3B and S4B).
Tg(phd3::EGFP) zebraﬁsh as a live reporter of hypoxia
Our results predict that the Tg(phd3::EGFP)i144/þ embryos
should act as a live reporter of hypoxia, and to validate this we
exposed the transgenic embryos to reduced oxygen environment in a hypoxic chamber for stipulated periods of time.
When we subjected 12 hpf transgenic embryos to 5% O2
(hypoxia) for 12 hours, phd3::EGFP expression was triggered
indicating the activation of Hif in these embryos (Fig. 3A). In
contrast, the normoxia-raised control embryos showed no
expression of the transgene at the corresponding stages. High
levels of ﬂuorescence observed in the CNS and pronephros of
the hypoxia-raised embryos implies vigorous Hif activity in
these organ systems in eliciting critical adaptive mechanisms.
To understand whether Hif stabilization could be induced

phd3::EGFP transgene functions as an in vivo ﬂuorescent
marker for intratumoral hypoxia
Because the presence of hypoxic regions is a hallmark
of locally advanced solid tumors, we asked whether the
phd3::EGFP transgene could be used as a novel reporter for
detecting intratumoral hypoxic regions in ﬁsh tumor
models. To test this hypothesis, we induced melanoma in the
Tg(phd3::EGFP)i144/i144 ﬁsh by injecting a human oncogenic
HRASG12V (V12RAS::mCherry) construct into single-cell embryos and misexpressing the oncogene speciﬁcally in cells of the
melanocyte lineage (33). Few days after injections, the V12RAS
injected ﬁsh developed several clones of ectopic melanocytes
and after few weeks they progressed into melanocytic naevi.
Subsequently, after 3 months we observed few of these lesions
to form small tumor nodules. As these melanoma nodules
became expanded into melanomas, we periodically monitored
them for phd3::EGFP expression. After 1 year, few ﬁsh with large
tumors (Fig. 4A) exhibited distinct regions of phd3::EGFPmediated ﬂuorescence (Fig. 4C). These EGFPþ regions are
likely to correspond to intratumoral hypoxic areas in these
melanomas, essentially revealing a subpopulation of tumor
cells that possess activated hypoxia-mediated Hif signaling.
Histologic analysis of these samples using proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA), Hif-1a and GFP antibody staining
revealed clear demarcation of the hypoxic regions within these
tumors (Fig. 4D–G). When taking into account the differences
in expected half-lives of EGFP (Supplementary Fig S5) and HIF1a (34) proteins, we observed good correlation between GFP
and Hif-1a staining within the melanoma (Fig. 4F and G), thus
validating that the EGFPþ regions correspond to intratumoral
hypoxic regions with activated Hif signaling. These experiments show the potential of the phd3::EGFP transgene in
tracking hypoxia under in vivo tumor pathologic conditions
in zebraﬁsh.

during early embryonic development itself, we subjected 128cell stage transgenic embryos to hypoxia for 4 hours. We
observed strong induction of the transgene in the hypoxiaraised embryos by 70% epiboly stage (Fig. 3B) compared with
the normoxia-raised embryos, which showed no induction.
When we assayed the hypoxia-raised embryos for Hif-1a levels
using Western blot analysis, strong presence of Hif-1a was
detected in them compared with normoxia-raised embryos,
which showed only negligible levels of Hif-1a (Fig. 3C). These
observations indicate the usefulness of Tg(phd3::EGFP)i144/þ
embryos as a robust sensor to detect hypoxia.

vhlþ/ zebraﬁsh are highly susceptible to DMBA
tumorigenesis
The vhlþ/ ﬁsh are not obviously predisposed to neoplasia
formation. One reason for the lack of tumors might be that the
lifespan of the ﬁsh is too short to accumulate the necessary
changes. Hence we asked whether DMBA treatment of Tg
(phd3::EGFP)i144/þ;vhlþ/ ﬁsh would make them susceptible to
tumorigenesis. We treated 4 batches of 21 dpf ﬁsh fry with
DMBA (23), with each batch consisting of an equal mix of Tg
(phd3::EGFP)i144/þ;vhlþ/þ and Tg(phd3::EGFP)i144/þ;vhlþ/
genotypes. Two months after the treatment, we observed that
a subset of ﬁsh in every batch possessed EGFPþ cell clones,
primarily in retina (Supplementary Fig. S6A), skin (Supplementary Fig. S6B), gills and ﬁns because of easy identiﬁcation
of ﬂuorescent cells in these tissues. When we segregated such
ﬁsh having EGFPþ cells and conducted genotyping analysis:
89% (102/114) was found to be vhlþ/ carriers (Supplementary
Table S2). The activation of phd3::EGFP-mediated GFP ﬂuorescence in random cell populations in the treated ﬁsh suggested DMBA-induced loss of the wild-type vhl allele in these
cells. Expectedly, the frequency of occurrence of EGFPþ cells is
signiﬁcantly higher in the vhlþ/ heterozygotes where only a
single wild-type copy needs to be lost.

After growing all the experimental ﬁsh for 14 months, they
were culled and processed for histologic analysis. Serial sagittal
sections were made for every sample and subsequently immunostained for the proliferation marker, PCNA. Screening of the
PCNA-stained slide preparations showed a signiﬁcant increase
(P < 0.02, Chi-square test) in the occurrence of neoplastic
growth in the DMBA-treated vhlþ/ samples (59%) than the
similarly treated wild-type samples (23%; Table 1). In many
cases, the tumor formation was found in the liver, bile duct, and
gut tissues. Importantly, the analysis also showed that the
ﬂuorescing tissues in all strongly EGFPþ ﬁsh to correlate with
neoplasias.
The wild-type adult zebraﬁsh intestine showed a regular
arrangement of villi and the proliferating epithelial cells were
observed to be strictly restricted to intervillus pockets (Fig. 4J;
refs. 35 and 36). However, in the DMBA-treated vhlþ/ ﬁsh, we
observed a disorganized pattern of intestinal villi architecture
(n ¼ 8; Fig. 4K) and these villi were completely encompassed by
PCNAþ proliferating epithelial cells (Fig. 4K) analogous to
adenoma formation in the human gut. A few of the gut tumors
showed abnormally proliferating intestinal epithelial cells in
one half of the gut whereas the other half showed restricted
presence of PCNAþ cells (Fig. 4L and M). A few samples
exhibited lesions wherein PCNAþ epithelial cells were scattered all through the intestinal villi (Fig. 4M).
The liver tissue in zebraﬁsh consists of hepatocytes, bile
ducts, and portal vessels (35). In the wild-type liver tissue
usually very few proliferating cells are present (Fig. 4N), but in
the DMBA treated vhlþ/ ﬁsh we observed the presence of
highly proliferating hepatocytes (n ¼ 18) in the liver tissue (Fig.
4O). These tumors were identiﬁed histologically as primary
hepatocellular carcinoma, wherein either the whole liver or
selected regions of liver tissue showed strong staining for
PCNA (Fig. 4P and Q). These liver neoplasias showed altered
hepatic architecture as well as abnormal cell morphology along
with apoptotic characteristics such as presence of fragmented
nuclei (Fig. 4R). Similarly, compared with the wild-type bile
duct tissue, which were not actively proliferating, the DMBAtreated ﬁsh possessed enlarged, abnormally shaped bile ductules as well as cysts. These bile ducts exhibited the presence of

PCNAþ epithelial cells as well as showing abnormal growth of
these ducts leading to the development of cholangiocarcinoma
(Fig. 4S).
In addition, we also observed occurrence of testicular (Supplementary Fig. S7A) and ovarian (Supplementary Fig. S7B)
tumors in the DMBA treated wild-type and vhlþ/ batches at
equal frequencies.
DMBA induces enhanced proliferation of epithelial cells
in vhlþ/ renal tubules
Because ccRCC originates from renal epithelial cells and the
human VHL gene is observed to exhibit strong tumor suppressor activity in renal tubules, we asked whether the DMBA
treatment of vhlþ/ ﬁsh could trigger proliferation of renal
tubular epithelial cells. Hence, we screened the kidney regions
in the PCNA-stained slide preparations of DMBA treated
vhlþ/ and wild-type groups. In the untreated samples (both
wild-type and vhlþ/), the hematopoietic cells in the kidney
strongly expressed the proliferation marker, PCNA, and the
epithelial cells of the tubules are found to be mostly quiescent.
However, the DMBA treatment is observed to induce the
transformation of the epithelial cells of renal tubules to a
proliferative state as evidenced by robust PCNAþ staining
(Fig. 5A–F). A normal renal tubule typically consists of a single
organized layer of epithelial cells but, in contrast, most of the
proliferating renal tubules exhibited abnormal organization of
epithelial cells (Fig. 5A–F) as well as altered cellular morphology (Fig. 5C and E). Statistical analysis showed a highly
signiﬁcant increase in the number of proliferative renal tubules
in DMBA treated vhlþ/ ﬁsh compared with the controls
(26/30; P < 0.0002, Chi-square test; Supplementary Table S4).
These observations suggest that DMBA can induce strong
proliferation of renal epithelial cells in the vhlþ/ ﬁsh.
Vhl exhibits tumor suppressor function in zebraﬁsh
The observation that after DMBA treatment, 85% of the
ﬁsh with EGFPþ tumors belonged to the vhlþ/ group suggested that such tumors might have originated from vhl null
cells and hence most of the tumor cells might be possessing
vhl/ genotype. To address this question, we isolated tumor
cells, by laser capture microdissection (LCM), from parafﬁn
tissue sections of 5 vhlþ/ EGFPþ tumor samples, extracted

Normally, the renal tubules are composed of a single layer of quiescent

genomic DNA and conducted standard sequencing analysis.
But, we were unable to identify unambiguously the loss of
wild-type vhl allele in these samples, either at the vhlhu2117
locus or elsewhere in the coding region (Supplementary
Fig. S8).
To extend this analysis further, we wanted to quantify the
levels of vhl mRNA in the vhlþ/ EGFPþ tumor cells. We
dissected tumor tissue from 5 different strongly ﬂuorescing
EGFPþ ﬁsh (Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B) selected from a
DMBA treated vhlþ/ group, isolated total RNA and conducted
quantitative real-time PCR analysis. In 4 of 5 tumor samples,
we observed a medium to strong decrease in the vhl mRNA
levels compared with control (Supplementary Fig. Fig. S9C),
suggesting that in these samples the wild type Vhl function
could be lost/reduced either by mutation(s) or by epigenetic
inactivation. Because of technical limitations, we could not
assay potential molecular lesion(s) on the wild-type vhl allele in
these neoplastic cells with decreased vhl mRNA levels. The fact
that DMBA treatment led to tumorigenesis in 55 of 94 vhlþ/
ﬁsh compared with neoplasias in only 18 of 77 experimental

In this study, we have generated and validated a novel
reporter line, Tg(phd3::EGFP), for tracking VHL/HIF signaling
in zebraﬁsh. When we subjected the transgenic embryos to
hypoxia induced by either genetic, physical, or chemical conditions, we could observe strong activation of the transgene.
We have also showed the potential of the transgenic line as an
in vivo reporter for intratumoral hypoxia in a melanoma model
system. These phd3::EGFP transgenic embryos would be ideally
suited for small molecule screens to identify novel chemicals
that activate or suppress Hif activity in the wild-type or vhl/
background, respectively.
Several approaches are being utilized to monitor intratumoral hypoxia such as direct measurements of tumor oxygenation, assaying the levels of hypoxia marker proteins such as
carbonic anhydrase IX, lysyl oxidase, etc. and by using small
molecule markers such as EF5, pimonidazole, which are derivatives of 2-nitroimidazole, but many of these procedures are
invasive and time consuming (37, 38). Moreover, these procedures and/or molecular markers have not been successfully
employed for measuring hypoxia in zebraﬁsh (39), indicating
the need for novel markers for hypoxic signaling. The low
background expression and powerful induction by HIF could
make the Tg(phd3::EGFP)i144/i144 ﬁsh a novel ﬂuorescent marker for in vivo monitoring of hypoxic signaling in many zebraﬁsh
tumor model systems.
von Hippel-Lindau disease is characterized by formation of a
variety of tumor types, most importantly clear cell renal cell
carcinoma and retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas. Unfortunately, although a variety of mouse models
have been made for this disease, a comparable tumor suppressor activity of VHL homologs has been difﬁcult to show in
rodent models. Therefore, we tested for such a function of vhl in
the zebraﬁsh. Indeed, we report increased susceptibility of the
vhlþ/ zebraﬁsh to hepatic, bileduct, and intestinal tumorigenesis upon exposure to dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)
compared with the control ﬁsh. We also report signiﬁcantly
increased occurrence of proliferating renal tubules in the
DMBA-treated vhlþ/ batch compared with appropriate
controls.
We tracked for random occurrence of vhl LOH in live Tg
(phd3::EGFP)i144/i144; vhlþ/ ﬁsh by scoring for cells and/or cell
clones emitting strong EGFP ﬂuorescence. Although the 6month-old untreated vhlþ/ ﬁsh had approx. 1 to 2 detectable
EGFPþ cells in the skin and retinal epithelia, as they become
older (1.5–2-yr-old) they accumulated few more LOH events
in the skin epithelium ( 8–10 GFPþ cells/ﬁsh). Upon treatment with DMBA, the vhlþ/ ﬁsh showed a signiﬁcant increase
in the occurrence of vhl/ EGFPþ cells in the skin epithelium.
Probably owing to the low rate of spontaneous vhl LOH,
vhlþ/ heterozygous ﬁsh exhibited normal development and
showed no detectable signs of tumor or cyst formation. In the
case of Vhlhþ/ heterozygous mice, depending on the type of
genetic background, variable susceptibility to spontaneous

tumorigenesis were observed (refs. 40, 41, and 42). Because
many of the zebraﬁsh laboratory strains are not highly inbred
(43), the strain differences might be less pronounced in ﬁsh.
However, the lifespan of the zebraﬁsh is only a few years, so
even after the spontaneous vhl LOH at few cells they may not be
undergoing enough subsequent mutations in other genes to
predispose such ﬁsh with a disease phenotype. But, when we
challenged the vhlþ/ ﬁsh with DMBA, we observed a high
incidence of tumorigenesis arising from liver, bile duct, and
gut.
Interestingly, we observed decreased vhl mRNA levels in a
set of vhlþ/ EGFPþ tumors, suggesting that in these samples
the wild-type vhl allele might have undergone either loss-offunction mutation(s) or epigenetic silencing. Interestingly in
human VHL patients, an epigenetic mechanism for inactivation of the wild-type VHL allele, mediated through the transcriptional silencing of the gene via hypermethylation of a 50 CpG island, has been frequently observed (8, 44). DMBA in
addition to inducing mutations is also known to cause aberrant
methylation of 50 -CpG islands leading to epigenetic silencing of
gene(s) (45). Our study exhibit the potential of the vhlþ/
zebraﬁsh as a model to characterize molecular mechanisms
involved in VHL induced tumorigenesis.
Although occurrence of ccRCC is the classical VHL disease
phenotype, we did not observe development of renal cysts or
ccRCC in the DMBA-treated vhlþ/ ﬁsh within the 14-month
experimental period of our analysis. However, the presence of
a signiﬁcantly increased number of PCNAþ renal tubules
suggests that these proliferating tubules might be at an early
stage in the process of renal cyst formation. Some of these
proliferating tubules were dysplastic and might be comparable
to the VHL mutant foci that are observed in VHL patients (46).
Interestingly, the presence of a duplicated copy of the vhl

gene, a vhl-like (vll) gene in zebraﬁsh, indicates a possible
segregation of VHL functions between these 2 genes and it
would be interesting to assess the combined role of these genes
in renal tumor suppression.
