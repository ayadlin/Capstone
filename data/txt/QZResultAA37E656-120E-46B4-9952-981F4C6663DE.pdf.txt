to Distinct Microtubule Poisons

Abstract
Microtubule poisons are widely used in cancer treatment, but the factors determining the relative efficacy of
different drugs in this class remain obscure. In this study, we identified the NIMA kinase Nek4 in a genetic
screen for mediators of the response to Taxol, a chemotherapeutic agent that stabilizes microtubules. After
Taxol treatment, Nek4 promoted microtubule outgrowth, whereas Nek4 deficiency impaired G2-M arrest and
decreased formation of mitotic-like asters. In contrast, Nek4 deficiency sensitized cells to vincristine, which
destabilizes microtubules. Therefore, Nek4 deficiency may either antagonize or agonize the effects of microtubule poisons, depending on how they affect microtubule polymerization. Of note, Nek4 gene maps to a commonly deleted locus in non-small cell lung cancer. Thus, Nek4 deletion in this disease may rationalize the use
of particular types of microtubule poisons for lung cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1033–41. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Microtubules are highly dynamic tubulin polymers crucial
for the proper execution of numerous cellular processes.
They play key roles in mitosis, promoting both mitotic spindle formation as well as the subsequent segregation of replicated DNA. Consequently, microtubules are an attractive
anticancer target, as disruption of mitosis in highly proliferative cancer cells often results in cell death (1–5). Indeed,
several classes of microtubule-disrupting drugs are currently
used in clinical settings. Notably, the taxanes and the Vinca
alkaloids are frontline therapies in the treatment of ovarian,
breast, lung, and certain hematopoietic malignancies. Unfortunately, acquired and intrinsic drug resistance significantly
limits the efficacy of these agents (6–9).
One of the most widely studied mechanisms of tumor cell
survival following chemotherapy is multidrug resistance
(MDR), a phenotype involving decreased drug accumulation
resulting from increased drug efflux (10, 11). However, many
tumors with inactive MDR still display resistance to microtubule poisons. Thus, multifactorial or alternative mechanisms
of resistance must exist. Indeed, several resistance-causing
alterations at the drug-target interface have previously been
described for tubulin, including genetic mutations, isotype
selection, post-translational modification, and altered regulation (12). Further, modifications in downstream signal
transduction have also been suggested to contribute to

microtubule poison resistance (13–15). Still, major genetic
factors underlying the efficacy of microtubule-targeting
drugs, as well as the rationale for using one microtubule poison versus another, remain unclear.
In an effort to better understand the genetic basis of chemotherapeutic response to specific microtubule drugs, we
did an in vitro RNA interference (RNAi)–based screen for
mediators of the response to Taxol, a commonly used microtubule-stabilizing taxane. This screen identified Nek4, a gene
with unknown function belonging to a family of mitotic
kinases termed NIMA-related kinases. Functional studies
involving Nek4 showed that it has a role in microtubule regulation and that altered expression of this protein not only
affected chemotherapeutic response but also conferred differential sensitivity to select microtubule-disrupting drugs.
Interestingly, Nek4 is frequently deleted in lung cancer, and
Nek4 levels in several human cell lines correlated with differential sensitivity to microtubule poisons.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and chemicals. Eμ-myc mouse B-cell lymphomas were cultured in B-cell medium [45% DMEM/45%
IMDM/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), supplemented with 2
mmol/L L -glutamine and 5 μmol/L β-mercaptoethanol].
Mouse and human lung adenocarcinoma cells were cultured
in standard DMEM/FBS and RPMI 1640/FBS media, respectively. Chemotherapeutic agents were purchased from LC
Laboratories (Taxol) and Calbiochem (doxorubicin, vincristine, cisplatin, and 5-florouracil) and used at the indicated
concentrations. For in vivo studies, vincristine (0.9% NaCl solution) and Taxol (ethanol/cremophor/NaCl) were dissolved
immediately before injection.
Retroviral constructs. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were designed and cloned as previously described
(16). Sequences (5′-3′) targeted by shRNAs are as follows:

(Mm), CACGTGGATGCCGCTGATGAA; shNEK4-1 (Hs),
CAGCGTAAATATTGACATCTTA; shNEK4-4 (Hs), CTAAGGAGTAGTTGATAAATTA. Additional shRNA sequences are
available on request. Full-length human Nek4 cDNA was purchased from Open Biosystems (clone ID: 5169184) and cloned
into a murine stem cell virus–based retroviral vector (pMIG).
Cloning strategies and primer sequences are also available
from the authors on request.
RNAi screening. Screening was done using small pools
(∼48 shRNAs per pool) of the previously described “Cancer
1000” shRNA library (16). For a given shRNA pool, approximately 2 to 4 million infected lymphoma cells (1–2 million
uninfected cells/mL, 10 mL on a 10-cm tissue culture plate,
∼20% infection efficiency) were subjected to Taxol-based
green fluorescent protein (GFP) enrichment assays
(described below). shRNA identities in enriched pools were
subsequently determined as previously described (16).
Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR. For Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), protein or total
RNA was isolated after retroviral infection and puromycin selection. Quantitative RT-PCR was done using SYBR Green on a
Bio-Rad thermal cycler. Nek4 mRNA levels were normalized to
relative glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
mRNA abundance. Primer sequences are available on request.
For Western blotting, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer
[1% sodium deoxycholine, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100,
10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 140 mmol/L NaCl] for 10 min,
cleared for 15 min at 14,000 rpm, and then mixed with 5× SDS
sample buffer. Proteins were then run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel,
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore), and
detected with the following antibodies: anti-Nek4 (1:250; Hahn
Laboratory, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) and anti-GAPDH
(1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells for immunofluorescence were grown and treated on poly-L-lysine–coated coverslips, fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min at −20°C, and stored
for later use. Anti–α-tubulin (YL1/2; 1:2,000; Abcam) and
anti–γ-tubulin (1:200; Sigma) were used along with Alexa secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) to visualize microtubules and centrosomes, respectively. Stained coverslips were
imaged and analyzed using Applied Precision DeltaVision
instruments and deconvolution software.
Flow cytometry and cell cycle experiments. All assays
were done using Becton Dickinson FACScan or MoFlo flow
cytometers. Cell death was detected by propidium iodide (PI)
incorporation (0.05 mg/mL), and dead cells were excluded
from GFP analysis. Live cell sorting was done using GFP coexpression as a marker of cell transduction. For phosphohistone H3 (pH3)/PI (cell cycle) assays, cells were fixed in
70% ethanol and then stained using an anti-pH3 antibody
(1:2,500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by an Alexa
(488) secondary antibody. Stained cells were then costained
in a sodium citrate/PI buffer before fluorescence-activated
cell sorting analysis.
GFP competition and viability assays. For competition
assays, lymphoma cells were partially transduced with the
indicated shRNA constructs, treated with chemotherapeutic
agents (Taxol at 4, 6, and 8 nmol/L; doxorubicin at 10 ng/mL;

1034

cisplatin at 7.5 ng/mL; 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at 40 ng/mL; and
vincristine at 1.5 nmol/L), and monitored by flow cytometry
for changes in the percentage of GFP+ cells. For viability
assays, cells were plated subconfluently in 96-well plates,
treated with drug (lung adenocarcinoma, colo669, H460,
and H1395 cells were treated with 5 μmol/L Taxol or
5 μmol/L vincristine and Sklu1 cells were treated with 0.04,
0.2, 1, 5, 25, and 125 μmol/L Taxol or vincristine), and analyzed 48 h after treatment using CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) on an Applied Biosystems microplate luminometer.
In vivo mouse experiments. Syngeneic C57BL6/J female
recipient mice were i.v. injected (via tail vein) with 4 million
lymphoma cells and monitored until palpable tumors formed
(∼14 days). On tumor presentation, mice were administered
either 25 mg/kg Taxol or 1.0 mg/kg vincristine (short-term
enrichment studies) or 1.5 mg/kg vincristine (long-term survival studies) i.p. and monitored until the indicated time
points, at which time mice were sacrificed and tumor material was collected, if necessary.
Microtubule polymerization assay. Cells plated on poly-Llysine–coated coverslips were treated with 0.5 μmol/L nocodazole for 30 min at 37°C/5% CO2. Coverslips were briefly
washed with PBS and allowed to recover for the indicated
periods of time in nocodazole-free medium at room temperature. Coverslips were then fixed using ice-cold methanol
(5 min, −20°C) and stored in 4% bovine serum albumin,
0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.05% sodium azide for subsequent
immunofluorescent detection of α-tubulin and γ-tubulin.
Microtubule length measurements were done on representative images (five fields per sample) using OpenLab5 (Improvision) software.

Results
RNAi screen for modulators of Taxol-induced cell death.
We used cells from a well-established preclinical model of
Burkitt's lymphoma, the Eμ-myc mouse, to screen a library
of shRNAs (the Cancer 1000) for genes that promote the
activity of the microtubule poison Taxol. These shRNAencoding vectors also expressed GFP to facilitate easy
identification of transduced cells (17). shRNA pools were introduced into lymphoma cells by retroviral transduction,
such that 20% to 30% of the target cells were infected,
and were subsequently treated with Taxol to enrich for
shRNA-containing cells displaying enhanced drug resistance
(Fig. 1A). Using GFP-based flow cytometry to monitor the
percentage of transduced (GFP-positive) lymphoma cells,
we identified several pools that displayed GFP enrichment
following treatment with Taxol, indicating the presence of
at least one resistance-conferring shRNA within each pool.
Deconvolution of these enriched posttreatment shRNA pools
was done using a previously described PCR/colony sequencing technique (18). Identification of known modulators of
chemotherapeutic response (e.g., p53) using our screening
protocol suggested that this approach was sufficiently robust
to identify contributors to the cellular response to Taxol.

targeting Nek4 (shNek4) as a candidate suppressor of Taxolinduced death. As an initial validation measure, shNek4 was
isolated from the library and tested for the ability to promote
Taxol resistance as a single construct. As in our general
screening strategy, a population of lymphoma cells was partially transduced with the shNek4 construct (coexpressing
GFP), treated with Taxol, and analyzed by flow cytometry before and after treatment for changes in overall GFP percentage. In this context, shNek4-infected cells enriched relative to
cells receiving a control vector. Additional shRNA constructs
were then designed and tested to confirm this initial finding
and address potential issues arising from well-documented
“off-target” RNAi effects (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1). Im-

portantly, quantitative PCR analysis of Nek4 mRNA levels and
Western blotting for Nek4 protein in knockdown cells showed
a correlation between the level of Taxol resistance and the extent of target suppression (Fig. 1C).
To determine how Nek4 suppression might promote resistance to Taxol, we first examined whether Nek4 suppression
conferred resistance to other functionally distinct chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we examined the response of
shNek4-transduced cells to doxorubicin (a topoisomerase
poison), cisplatin (a platinum-based DNA cross-linking
agent), 5-FU (an antimetabolite), and vincristine (a microtubule destabilizer). To control for differential drug efficacy,
cells were treated with drug doses that resulted in ∼90%

partially infected with 48 pools of 48 distinct shRNAs, treated with Taxol (4, 6, and 8 nmol/L), and monitored using GFP-based flow cytometry for changes in

sequenced to determine relative shRNA abundance. B, an in vitro GFP competition assay comparing relative Taxol sensitivity in cells infected with two

cells was determined 48 h after treatment (n = 3 for doxorubicin, 5-FU, and cisplatin and n = 5 for vincristine treatments). Bars, SD. P values were determined using a Student's t test.

death at 48 h. GFP competition assays using the most potent
Nek4 shRNA (shNek4-2) revealed no significant change in
GFP percentage when treated with doxorubicin, cisplatin,
or 5-FU. Unexpectedly, Nek4 suppression sensitized lymphoma cells to treatment with vincristine, as evidenced by a depletion of GFP-positive shNek4-2–transduced cells following
drug treatment (Fig. 1D). Given that Taxol and vincristine
have opposing effects on microtubule stabilization, yet activate similar downstream checkpoints (19–21), these results
suggested that Nek4 might promote or inhibit drug action
directly at microtubules, as opposed to acting in a signaling
network emanating from microtubule disruption.
Many regulators of microtubule dynamics have observable
effects on cell cycle progression. Further, many chemotherapeutic agents preferentially affect actively cycling cells. To
address the possibility that Nek4 suppression promotes Taxol resistance by altering cell cycle progression, we determined the population growth rate, cell cycle profile (DNA
content analysis), and mitotic index of shNek4-transduced
cells. All three shNek4 populations were indistinguishable
from control cells in these experiments, suggesting that gross
impairment of the cell cycle was not responsible for the Taxolresistant phenotype (Table 1).
We next sought to determine if Nek4 status had any effect
on microtubule poison–induced cell cycle profiles. For these
experiments, we used a cell line derived from a previously described LSL-KrasG12D;p53fl/fl lung adenocarcinoma mouse model (22). These cells display a more protracted response
to chemotherapy (as opposed to highly chemosensitive
Eμ-myc lymphoma cells), allowing us to more clearly define
subtle changes in the intermediate events preceding cell
death. Importantly, we first confirmed that these cells also
display opposing survival profiles in response to microtubulestabilizing versus microtubule-destabilizing drugs (Fig. 2A).
Additionally, consistent with the data observed from untreated lymphoma cells, a comparison of 4N/2N DNA content
ratios of untreated control versus shNek4-2 lung adenocarcinoma cells revealed little to no difference in cell cycle distribution (Fig. 2B, first column). However, in the presence of
5 μmol/L Taxol, shNek4-2–transduced lung adenocarcinoma
cells displayed a defective G2-M arrest relative to vectorinfected controls. Conversely, vincristine treatment yielded a
more pronounced accumulation of G2-M–arrested cells in
the absence of Nek4 (Fig. 2B). Thus, the cellular status of

Nek4 seems to affect the efficacy of microtubule poisons proximal to the drug-target interface.
Nek4 is involved in the regulation of microtubules following exposure to microtubule poisons. Exposure to Taxol
is known to have profound effects on microtubule organization, namely, the accumulation of mitotic-like asters and formation of abnormal microtubule bundles (23, 24). Because
precise microtubule phenotypes are known to vary from cell
type to cell type (25), we first examined the effect of Taxol
on microtubules in lung adenocarcinoma cells. After a 4-h exposure to Taxol, we found evidence of both mitotic-like asters and microtubule bundles in control cells. Under these
conditions, the “aster” phenotype predominated (Fig. 3A;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Quantification of this phenotype in
Taxol-treated control versus shNek4-transduced cell populations revealed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells
harboring these aster-like structures: ∼14% in Nek4 knockdown populations as compared with ∼22% in controls
(Fig. 3A and B). Importantly, this effect was not simply dependent on the number of cells available to form asters, as
the mitotic index was not significantly different between the
two cell populations, either in the presence or in the absence
of Taxol or vincristine (Fig. 3B, right).
It has been previously reported that alterations in microtubule dynamics are associated with and can contribute to
microtubule poison efficacy (26). Using an established in situ
microtubule polymerization assay, we examined whether
Nek4 knockdown had any effect on microtubule repolymerization following nocodazole treatment. Cells were transiently exposed to nocodazole to depolymerize existing
microtubules; washed with excess medium to initiate repolymerization; and fixed, stained, and imaged at various time
points to examine microtubule status. After a 30-min incubation with nocodazole, microtubules were no longer detectable,
as determined using α-tubulin immunofluorescence. Whereas
control cells showed rapid microtubule polymerization from
centrosomes following nocodazole release, defects in microtubule assembly in Nek4 knockdown cells were apparent as early
as 1 min following release and clearly observable at the 2-min
time point (Fig. 3C and D). This suggests that impaired microtubule polymerization may underlie the differential sensitivity
of Nek4 knockdown cells to Taxol and vincristine.

preclinical system is the ability to transplant genetically altered tumor cells into syngeneic, immunocompetent recipient mice, where the resulting disease is pathologically
indistinguishable from lymphomas arising in germ-line Eμmyc mice (27). This, along with the ability to specifically silence individual genes, allows for rapid evaluation of putative
regulators of chemotherapeutic response in an immunocompetent in vivo setting (Fig. 4A). Using this approach, we

transplanted partially transduced control and shNek4-2
knockdown lymphomas into recipient mice and allowed palpable tumors to form (∼14 days). On tumor presentation,
mice were administered either 25 mg/kg Taxol or 1.0 mg/kg
vincristine for 24 h, at which time tumor material was harvested for analysis by flow cytometry. In agreement with
in vitro experiments, acute treatment of control tumors had
no effect on the percentage of GFP-positive cells (data not
shown). In contrast, the percentage of GFP-positive shNek42 cells increased on treatment with Taxol while selectively depleting when exposed to vincristine (Fig. 4B). Further, mice
harboring pure population (GFP-sorted) shNek4-2 tumors
showed an improved overall response to vincristine, with extended tumor-free and overall survival relative to their control counterparts (Fig. 4C; data not shown).
Nek4 status modulates the relative sensitivity of human
lung cancer cell lines to microtubule poisons. Microtubule
poisons are frontline chemotherapies for the treatment of
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Interestingly, many lung
cancers harbor deletions on the short arm of chromosome 3
that include the Nek4 genomic locus. Thus, we reasoned that
Nek4 status in NSCLC might contribute to the differential response of lung cancer cell lines to microtubule poisons. Given the complex constellation of mutations undoubtedly
present across multiple cell lines, we limited our analysis
to the relative sensitivity of cell lines to Taxol versus vincristine. We tested several cell lines: one with a high level of Nek4
protein (colo669) and three (Sklu1, H460, and H1395) with
reduced Nek4 levels. Interestingly, we found that colo669
cells had a significantly lower Taxol versus vincristine survival ratio, indicative of relative Taxol sensitivity and/or vincristine resistance (Fig. 5A). Importantly, shRNA-mediated
knockdown of Nek4 in colo669 cells changed the response
profile of these cells, promoting both Taxol resistance and
vincristine sensitivity (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S2).
Conversely, changes in drug sensitivity were not seen in a cell
line expressing low levels of Nek4 (Sklu1). However, overexpression of human Nek4 promoted vincristine resistance and
sensitivity to multiple taxanes in Sklu1 cells (Fig. 5C and D).
Thus, Nek4 levels in human cancers can significantly affect
the relative sensitivity of these tumors to distinct microtubule poisons.

The founding member of the NIMA kinase family was first
identified in an Aspergillus nidulans screen for mutants that
were “never in mitosis” (28, 29). Since then, 11 NIMA kinases
have been identified by homology in mammalian cells. Four of
these proteins—Nek2, Nek6, Nek7, and Nek9—have been
shown to play roles in mitosis, whereas Nek1 and Nek8 are
important for cilia function (30–32). Here, we show that
Nek4 also plays a role in microtubule homeostasis. Importantly, however, this effect is only seen in the context of microtubule poisons. Multiple explanations could account for this
effect. First, other proteins may compensate for Nek4 loss of
function during mitosis in untreated cells. Alternatively, partial
Nek4 activity may be sufficient to allow for normal mitosis.

Nek4 Status Affects Microtubule Poison Efficacy

Figure 4. Nek4 suppression alters the response to microtubule poisons in vivo. A, schematic depicting in vivo experimental approaches. Partially
transduced (top row) or GFP-sorted (bottom row) lymphoma cells were injected into recipient mice and allowed to develop into palpable lymphomas.
Resulting tumors were then treated with Taxol (tax) or vincristine (vin) and then either harvested to examine the percentage of GFP+ cells or monitored for
tumor-free and overall survival rates. B, partially transduced shNek4-2 lymphomas were harvested 24 h after drug treatment (25 mg/kg Taxol or 1.0 mg/kg
vincristine) and analyzed by flow cytometry for changes in GFP percentage. Taxol treatment resulted in an increase in the percentage of GFP+ cells
(compared with preinjection GFP levels), whereas vincristine-treated tumors displayed dramatic selection against Nek4 knockdown. P values were
determined using a Student's t test. C, Kaplan-Meier survival curve depicting overall survival of shNek4-2 or control tumor-bearing mice following treatment
with a maximally tolerated dose (1.5 mg/kg) of vincristine (vector, n = 13; shNek4-2, n = 12). P values were determined using a log-rank test.

Although the shRNAs used in this study achieve near-complete
knockdown of Nek4 by Western blot, it remains to be seen
whether these vectors recapitulate Nek4-null phenotypes.
Interestingly, Nek4 deficiency results in resistance to Taxol
and sensitivity to vincristine. These data suggest that Nek4
functions at the level of microtubules rather than on common downstream signal transduction pathways emanating
from altered microtubule homeostasis. Given that, at high
drug doses, Taxol is a microtubule-stabilizing agent and vincristine destabilizes microtubules, our data also suggest that
Nek4 may play a role in promoting microtubule polymerization in the presence of the drug. Consistent with this idea,
Nek4 deficiency impairs microtubule repolymerization
following nocodazole treatment. That a genetic alteration
can confer opposite cellular responses to vincristine and Taxol is not novel (33–36). Previous efforts in generating Taxolresistant cell lines have, in some instances, yielded cells that

www.aacrjournals.org

were vincristine sensitive (34, 35, 37). Notably, these studies
highlighted the ability of tubulin mutations to confer differential sensitivity to microtubule poisons. Here, loss of function screening allowed for the identification of a regulator of
therapeutic response that may have been overshadowed in
these earlier efforts, presumably by more potent modifiers
of the cellular response to microtubule poisons. Importantly,
the effects of Nek4 manipulation on overall response to microtubule poisons are relatively minor, so further work will
be required to determine whether pharmacologic inhibition
of Nek4 or associated proteins would have significant clinical
benefit.
Interestingly, Nek4 is located in a genomic region that is
commonly mutated in lung cancer. Although it is unclear
whether Nek4 is relevant to the pathogenesis of lung cancer,
these data suggest a connection between the specific alterations that occur during lung cancer development and the

Figure 5. Nek4-dependent
differential sensitivity to
microtubule poisons in human lung
adenocarcinoma cells. A, four
human lung adenocarcinoma cell
lines were separately treated with
Taxol and vincristine and examined
for viability 48 h after treatment.
Viability comparisons (left) at a
fixed drug dose of 5 μmol/L Taxol
or vincristine revealed one cell line
(colo669) with a significantly
lower Taxol/vincristine survival
ratio. This cell line also had high
baseline levels of Nek4 protein
(right, Western blot). B, colo669
cells were retrovirally infected with
shRNAs targeting human Nek4
and subjected to in vitro survival
assays. Knockdown cells with
significant depletion of Nek4
protein (right, Western blot) also
showed relative resistance to Taxol
and sensitivity to vincristine
(left, shown as an upward shift in
the Taxol/vincristine survival ratio).
C, transduction of “low-Nek4”
Sklu1 cells with Nek4 shRNAs did
not affect their relative sensitivity to
Taxol and vincristine. Bottom,
Western blot showing Nek4 levels
following transduction of Sklu1
cells with Nek4 shRNAs or a
Nek4 cDNA. D, Sklu1 cells stably
overexpressing full-length Nek4
cDNA were treated with either
Taxotere or vincristine for 48 h,
at which time cell viability was
assessed using CellTiter-Glo
reagents. Mann-Whitney statistical
comparison of EC50 values
derived from best-fit nonlinear
regression curves revealed
increased sensitivity (average
EC50: vector control = 10.5 μmol/L
and NEK4 = 5.5 μmol/L; P = 0.002)
to Taxotere and resistance to
vincristine (average EC50: vector
control = 3.3 μmol/L and
NEK4 = 6.4 μmol/L; P = 0.002) in
cells overexpressing Nek4. Data
were generated from three
independent experiments for
each drug.

ultimate response of that cancer to chemotherapy. Notably,
the fact that Nek4 deficiency confers sensitivity to microtubule destabilizers suggests that existing therapies can be tailored toward this deficiency. For example, the combination
of cisplatin and Taxol is commonly used as a frontline therapy for NSCLC. Our data suggest that a more personalized
approach to treating lung cancer, using vincristine rather
than Taxol in tumors with 3p deletions, may result in enhanced chemotherapeutic response.
