Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cancer immunoediting is a process by which immune cells, particularly lymphocytes of the
adaptive immune system, protect the host from the development of cancer and alter tumour
progression by driving the outgrowth of tumour cells with decreased sensitivity to immune
attack1,2. Carcinogen-induced mouse models of cancer have shown that primary tumour
susceptibility is enhanced in immune-compromised mice, while conversely, the capacity for such
tumours to grow after transplantation into wild-type mice is reduced2,3. However, many questions
about the process of cancer immunoediting remain unanswered due, in part, to the known
antigenic complexity and heterogeneity of carcinogen-induced tumours4. Here we have adapted a
genetically engineered, autochthonous mouse model of sarcomagenesis to investigate the process
of cancer immunoediting. This system allowed us to monitor the onset and growth of
immunogenic and non-immunogenic tumours induced in situ that harbor identical genetic and
histopathological characteristics. By comparing the development of such tumours in immunecompetent mice to mice with broad immunodeficiency or specific antigenic tolerance, we show
that recognition of tumour-specific antigens (TSAs) by lymphocytes is critical for immunoediting
against sarcomas. Furthermore, primary sarcomas were edited to become less immunogenic
through the selective outgrowth of cells that were able to escape T lymphocyte attack. Loss of
tumour antigen expression or MHCI presentation was necessary and sufficient for this
immunoediting process to occur. These results highlight the importance of TSA expression in
immune surveillance, and potentially, immunotherapy.

To determine whether T lymphocytes influence tumour development, we adapted a mouse
model of human soft tissue sarcomagenesis driven by Cre/LoxP-regulated expression of
oncogenic K-rasG12D and deletion of p53 to allow for the control of tumour
immunogenicity5. Sarcomas were induced in either immune-competent K-rasLSL-G12D/+;

mice by intramuscular injection of lentiviral vectors that expressed Cre recombinase alone
(Lenti-x) or, to induce sarcomas with potentially immunogenic antigens, we used vectors
that also expressed the T cell antigens SIYRYYGL (SIY) and two antigens from ovalbumin
(SIINFEKL (SIN, OVA257–264) and OVA323–339) fused to the C-terminus of luciferase
(Lenti-LucOS). Intramuscular injection of Lenti-LucOS led to tumour formation in 100% of
KPR mice but only 27% of KP mice by 140 days (Fig. 1a, p< 0.0001). Additional sarcomas
ultimately developed in KP mice but with dramatically delayed kinetics (latency of 194.8 ±
43.4 days) compared with KPR mice (73.6 ± 4.3 days) (Fig. 1c, p< 0.02). We also observed
a difference in the penetrance of sarcoma development in KPR versus KP mice by 140 days
with Lenti-x (89% versus 43%, respectively), although the difference was less dramatic than
observed with Lenti-LucOS (Fig. 1b, p< 0.0005). This suggests that in this model, tumour
immunosurveillance may not necessitate the introduction of highly immunogenic tumourspecific antigens (TSAs). The observed immunosurveillance against Lenti-x tumours could
result from the lentiviral infection required to induce tumours, the acquisition of TSAs
during tumour development, or the immunogenicity of Cre itself. However, in a previous
study, we found that Cre was not highly immunogenic when expressed in developing lung
adenocarcinomas6. Although Lenti-x-induced sarcoma development was slightly delayed in
immune-competent (KP) mice (114.9 days in KP versus 79.5 days in KPR mice), it was not
significant (Fig. 1c, p= 0.11). The increased latency that is specific to Lenti-LucOS tumours
may be the result of an equilibrium between replicating tumour cells and T cells that
recognize antigens expressed from the LucOS vector and restrain tumour progression1,7.

Rag-2 deficiency prevents both T and B lymphocyte development and, therefore, could have
pleiotropic effects on the immune response to tumour antigens. To specifically test the
significance of T cell responses, we treated mice with antibodies against CD4 and CD8 to
deplete T cells concurrent with, or subsequent to, intramuscular injection of Lenti-LucOS. T
cell depletion at tumour initiation, or even 14 days after tumour initiation, led to sarcoma
development with complete penetrance and early onset similar to KPR mice (Fig. 1d, p=
0.001 and p= .013 compared to untreated, respectively). To specifically test the importance
of CD8+ T cells that recognize the model TSAs, we made use of a regulatable luciferaseSIY fusion gene engineered into the murine Rosa26 locus (R26LSL-LSIY)8. These mice
develop specific tolerance to luciferase and SIY due to weak thymic expression and deletion
of reactive T cells (Supplementary Fig. 1)8. K-rasLSL-G12D/+;p53fl/fl;R26LSL-LSIY/+ (KPLSIY) mice injected with Lenti-LucS, a lenti-vector that expresses Cre and SIY fused to
luciferase, were more susceptible to sarcoma formation and developed tumours earlier than
KP littermates (Fig. 1e, p= 0.058). Thus, lymphocyte-mediated protection from sarcoma
formation requires CD8+ T cells that respond to non-self antigens expressed in tumours.
A key advantage of this conditional, genetically engineered cancer model over carcinogeninduced models is the capacity to track endogenous T cells specific for tumour antigens
during primary tumour development. We used SIY and SIN loaded MHCI/Kb reagents to
track tumour-reactive CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Only mice with Lenti-LucOS
sarcomas harbored CD8+ T cells specific to SIY and SIN in the lymph nodes nearest the
tumour site as well as in the spleen (Fig. 2a, b). These CD8+ T cells appeared to be

completely functional because they produced both IFN-γ and TNF-α upon stimulation (Fig.
2a–d). Interestingly, this contrasts sharply with results from an analogous model of lung
adenocarcinoma in which the activity of T cells responding to the same tumour antigens was
very weak, suggesting that different tumour types may use different mechanisms to escape
immune attack6. We also investigated whether KP mice that did not develop sarcomas after
injection with Lenti-LucOS harbored antigen-specific T cells, since such T cells could have
protected these mice from sarcoma development. Indeed, we detected fully functional
antigen-specific T cells in these mice (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1), demonstrating
that T cells specific to these model TSAs are functional and likely provide significant
protection against the development of Lenti-LucOS sarcomas.

Pivotal experiments using MCA-induced sarcomas revealed that tumours derived in
immune-compromised mice, and thus not immunoedited, are more susceptible to rejection
upon transplantation into immune-competent mice2. To assay whether autochthonous
sarcomas driven by targeted genetic mutations would also display an unedited phenotype,
we transplanted independently derived sarcomas from KPR or KP mice into either wild-type
or Rag-2−/− mice. While freshly isolated Lenti-LucOS-induced tumours (or cell lines)
generated in KP mice grew similarly upon transplantation into either wild-type or Rag-2−/−
mice, most Lenti-LucOS tumours generated in KPR mice were rejected (1/7) or had
significantly delayed growth (4/7) (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2). These results
recapitulate the original findings from carcinogen-induced sarcomas in a genetically
engineered mouse model of sarcomagenesis.

Next we wanted to determine whether Lenti-x-induced sarcomas, which lack the strong T
cell antigens from LucOS, would yield similar results. Interestingly, Lenti-x tumours
generated in KPR or KP mice grew equally well when transplanted into wild-type or
Rag-2−/− mice (Fig. 3c, d). It is noteworthy that while autochthonous tumours initiated by
Lenti-x appeared partially inhibited by an adaptive immune response (Fig. 1b), in the
context of transplantation, we found no evidence of immunoediting (Fig. 3c). This
difference may be due to Rag-dependent innate immune cells (NKT and γδ T cells) that
recognize stress or inflammatory ligands. These cells may be sufficient to eliminate a
limited number of nascent tumour cells in the context of transformation by lentiviral
infection, but not in response to the transplantation of fully developed tumours1,9.
Nevertheless, we hypothesize that Lenti-x sarcomas from KPR mice grew unabated after
transplantation into KP mice because immunoediting by T lymphocytes requires potent
TSAs, which these tumours lack. The observed immunogenicity of carcinogen-induced
sarcomas derived in immune-compromised mice may be due to the de novo generation of
potent tumour neoantigens during transformation with mutagens9–12. Importantly, in a
complimentary study reported in this issue, somatically mutated spectrin-β2 in a MCAinduced sarcoma was found to act as a potent neoantigen that drove the immunoediting
process (ref*). In an attempt to introduce immunogenic mutations in Lenti-x tumours, we
treated cell lines from these tumours with MCA in vitro. Interestingly, such treatment rarely
yielded clones with increased immunogenicity (Supplementary Fig. 3). This may indicate
that while carcinogens can produce mutations that are immunogenic, it may be a rare event.

If cancer immunoediting by lymphocytes requires potent TSAs, then Lenti-LucOS-induced
tumours that appear edited after forming in KP mice may have evaded an immune response
by the selective outgrowth of cells lacking these potent antigens13–15. To assess antigen
expression, we measured luciferase activity in tumours. Whereas tumours from KPR mice
were universally luciferase positive, tumours from KP mice had drastically reduced
luciferase activity in all but one of six sarcomas (Fig. 4a, b). Interestingly, this sarcoma had
significantly reduced H-2Kb expression, the MHC class I allele responsible for presenting
the SIY and SIN antigens (Fig. 4c). Sarcomas from KP mice treated with anti-CD4 and antiCD8 antibodies at tumour initiation also retained luciferase activity (5/6 sarcomas luc+, Fig.
4a). However, fewer sarcomas retained luciferase expression when mice were treated with
anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies beginning 14 days after tumour initiation (1/5 sarcomas
luc+), suggesting that immunoediting can occur very early during sarcoma development.
Thus, by selectively eliminating cells that express potent TSAs, T lymphocytes drive the
escape of tumour cells that either do not express potent antigens or cannot present the
antigens to reactive T cells.

Similar to the antigen loss observed in autochthonous sarcomas, Lenti-LucOS-induced
sarcomas from KPR mice lost antigen expression when transplanted into wild-type mice
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Importantly, tumours that lost antigen expression after being
passaged through wild-type mice grew comparably upon secondary transplantation into
wild-type and Rag-2−/− mice, whereas tumours passaged through Rag-2−/− mice did not
(Supplementary Fig. 4). To test whether antigen loss was sufficient to provide a means of
escape for Lenti-LucOS sarcomas derived in KP mice, we reintroduced the LucOS antigens
into sarcomas that had lost expression of the antigens after passage through wild-type mice
(referred to as AgLoss tumours). Indeed, re-expression of LucOS led to severely reduced
tumour growth (Fig. 4d), indicating that loss of antigen expression was the primary means of
tumour escape in this setting.
Epigenetic silencing of tumour antigen expression via DNA methylation could be
responsible for antigen loss and tumour escape16,17. To test this hypothesis, we treated cell
lines that had lost luciferase expression after transplantation into immune-competent mice
with 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (Aza), which reverses epigenetic silencing by inhibiting DNA
methylation. In several lines tested, luciferase activity was restored with Aza treatment (Fig.
4e). Therefore, epigenetic silencing of tumour antigens may represent an important
mechanism by which tumours can be edited in response to immune surveillance.

Here we have overcome many of the obstacles of carcinogen-induced models of cancer by
using an autochthonous, genetically engineered model of sarcomagenesis to show that T
lymphocyte-driven tumour antigen loss is a critical means by which cancer immunoediting
occurs in a primary tumour setting. While this study was limited to investigating the role of
anti-tumour immunity by T cells, this model could be adapted to investigate the role of other
critical immune cells in cancer immunoediting, such as B cells or NK cells, by either
introducing surface-expressed or stress-related antigens into tumours, respectively18–20. This
study resulted in two key discoveries. First, oncogene-driven, endogenous tumours can
undergo immunoediting in a manner similar to carcinogen-driven tumours if engineered to
express model TSAs. The immunogenicity of MCA-induced sarcomas is well-documented,

and may be a direct consequence of TSAs that arise from carcinogen-induced mutations of
normal genes during tumour development9,11,12(ref*). In contrast, cancers that arise
spontaneously or by targeted genetic mutations in mice have been reported to be weakly
immunogenic21–24. However, the mutational requirements for tumourigenesis in humans
may be greater than in mice,25 and thus it is possible that spontaneous or genetically
engineered mouse models of cancer might underestimate the mutational and antigenic load
of most human cancers. This idea is supported by the second critical finding of this study
that tumour immunogenicity is not a universal characteristic of cancer development. By
obviating the need for carcinogens, we could induce sarcomas that potentially lacked potent
TSAs. These tumours had significantly reduced immunogenicity despite no previous
engagement with the adaptive immune system and hence no opportunity for immunoediting.
These results provide the first experimental system to unify the heretofore apparently
conflicting results obtained using either carcinogen-induced or genetically targeted mouse
models of cancer by identifying TSAs as the critical determinants that invoke adaptive
immunosurveillance and immunoediting2,21. We propose that identifying and characterizing
TSAs in human cancers may be critical for the generation of more effective anti-cancer
immunotherapies in patients suffering with this disease.

METHODS SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Experiments used mice of the 129S4/SvJae strain. All animal studies and procedures were
approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Committee for Animal Care.
Sarcomas were induced in KP and KPR mice by intramuscular injection of the hind limb
with replication-incompetent lentiviruses expressing Cre recombinase as reported
previously5,6. To deplete T cells, anti-CD4 (GK1.5) and anti-CD8 (YTS169.4) antibodies
were administered at a dose of 250 µg/mouse by i.p. injection once weekly for the duration
of the experiment. Flow cytometry was performed as described6. For transplantation
experiments, 2×105 freshly isolated tumour cells or cultured tumour cells were transplanted
subcutaneously into immune-competent or Rag-2−/− mice of the 129S4/SvJae background.
Tumour volumes were calculated by multiplying the length × width × height of each
tumour. To detect luciferase activity, freshly explanted tumours or cell lines were lysed,
mixed with Luciferin reagent (Promega), and relative light units (RLU) were detected with a
luminometer (MGM Instruments). Aza treatment used 1 µM 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine for
three days. In vivo bioluminescence images were acquired with the NightOWLII LB983
(Berthold Technologies) or the IVIS Spectrum (Xenogen Corp.) after intraperitoneal
injection of 1.5 mg Beetle Luciferin (Promega). Statistical analyses utilized unpaired twotailed Fisher exact probability tests or Student’s t tests.

Mice were monitored twice weekly for palpable sarcoma formation beginning 50 days after
intramuscular injection. All animal studies and procedures were approved by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Committee for Animal Care.
Lentiviral production
Lentivirus was produced by transfection of 293T cells with Δ8.2 (gag/pol), CMV-VSV-G,
and the various transfer vectors expressing Cre as described26.
Antibody depletion
Anti-CD4 (GK1.5) and anti-CD8 (YTS169.4) antibodies were administered at a dose of 250

Preparation, culture, and transplantation of primary sarcomas

Author Manuscript

Primary sarcomas were explanted and single cell suspensions were generated by mincing
and digesting the tissues for ~1 hour at 37°C in 125 U/ml Collagenase Type I (Gibco), 60
U/ml Hyaluronidase (Sigma), and 2 mg/ml Collagenase/Dispase (Roche), followed by
passage through a 70 µm filter. Subcutaneous transplantation utilized 2×105 cells from
freshly isolated tumour cells or cell lines from primary autochthonous tumours that were
trypsinized and washed three times in plain DME medium. Transplant recipients were
immune-competent or Rag-2−/− mice on the 129S4/SvJae background from the same mouse
colony used to generate the autochthonous tumours. Subcutaneously transplanted tumour
volumes were calculated by multiplying the length × width × height of each tumour. In
Figure 3, the mean volume ± s.e.m. of each tumour line is depicted after transplantation into
wild-type mice (WT, open columns) at the time point when the same tumour line reached a
volume of 1000 mm3 in the Rag-2null transplanted mice (Rag-2null, filled columns).
Flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

Cell suspensions from lymphoid organs were prepared by mechanical disruption between
frosted slides. Cells were then stained with antibodies for 20–30 min after treatment with
FcBlock (BD Pharmingen). α-CD8α (53-6.7), α-IFNγ (XMG1.2), α-TNFα (MP6-XT22),
and DimerX I (Dimeric Mouse H-2Kb:Ig) were from BD Pharmingen. All antibodies were
used at 1:200 dilution. Peptide-loaded DimerX reagents were prepared as directed and used
at 1:75 dilution. To improve the sensitivity of the DimerX reagent, we utilized both PE and
APC labeled dimers to co-stain CD8+ T cells. Propidium iodide was used to exclude dead
cells. Cells were read on a FACSCalibur and analyzed using Flowjo software (Tree Star). In
Figure 2c–d, data was determined by comparing the fraction of CD8+ cells in duplicate
samples stained with Kb dimers or for cytokine production and exceeds 100% due to the
incomplete sensitivity of the Kb dimers to detect antigen specific cells. In Figure 4c, freshly
harvested sarcomas were cultured for 24 hours in the presence of 10 U IFN-γ (solid line) or
untreated (dashed line) and analyzed for H-2Kb surface expression (shaded, control
antibody)

Cells were resuspended in the presence or absence of SIYRYYGL and SIINFEKL peptides
in OPTI-MEM I (Gibco) supplemented with GolgiPlug (BD Pharmingen) for ~4 hours at
37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were then fixed and stained for intracellular cytokines using the
Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences).
Luciferase detection

Author Manuscript

Freshly explanted tumours or cell lines were lysed in Cell Culture Lysis Reagent, mixed
with Luciferase Assay Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega), and
relative light units (RLU) were detected using the Optocomp I luminometer (MGM
Instruments). RLUs were standardized by the total amount of protein (Bio-Rad Protein
Asssay) in each sample. In vivo bioluminescence images were acquired with the
NightOWLII LB983 (Berthold Technologies) or the IVIS Spectrum (Xenogen Corp.) after
intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mg Beetle Luciferin (Promega).
5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine treatment
Tumour cell lines were plated at low confluency (2×105 cells/ well of 6-well plate), and
treated with 1 µM 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine replaced daily for three consecutive days and then
analyzed for luciferase activity.

draining (DLN) or peripheral to (PLN) Lenti-x or Lenti-LucOS tumours. Bottom: IFN-γ and
TNF-α cytokine production in SIY+SIN-stimulated CD8+ T cells from mice analyzed
above. b, Analysis of splenocytes as in (a). c and d, Cumulative data depicting the
percentage of SIY and SIN-specific T cells that were IFN-γ+ TNF-α+ from lymph nodes (c)
or spleens (d) of KP mice infected with Lenti-LucOS that developed a “sarcoma” or were
“tumour-free” at 170 days. T cells reactive to SIY were analyzed four months after

Figure 3. Cancer immunoediting phenotypes require the presence of potent T cell antigens

Transplanted tumour growth of Lenti-LucOS-induced sarcomas generated in KPR (a) or KP
(b) mice and Lenti-x-induced sarcomas generated in KPR (c) or KP (d) mice. At left,
representative tumour growth curves from two different primary tumours (colored red or
blue) after transplantation into Rag-2null (dashed lines) or wild-type (WT, solid lines) mice.
At right, comparison of the mean tumour volume (mm3) ± s.e.m. for all tumours
transplanted. Φ indicates no detectable mass. See Supplementary Fig. 2 for growth curves of
tumour lines.

a, Representative luciferase activity of Lenti-LucOS and Lenti-x-induced sarcomas in KPR,
KP or anti-CD4/CD8 treated KP mice. b, Luciferase expression in Lenti-LucOS-induced
sarcoma cell lines derived in KPR or KP mice. c, Freshly harvested sarcomas cultured with
IFN-γ (solid line) or untreated (dashed line) were analyzed for H-2Kb surface expression
(shaded, control antibody). d, Growth of two independent tumours (3919 and 4070) that had
lost antigen expression (AgLoss, blue lines) or the same tumour lines after reintroduction of
LucOS (AgLoss-LucOS, red lines). Mean tumour volume ± s.e.m. after transplantation into
three wild-type mice (solid lines) or one Rag-2null mouse (dashed lines). e, Relative
luciferase activity (compared to the primary sarcoma) ± 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (Aza) of
Lenti-LucOS sarcomas from KPR mice (Primary, black columns) that were passaged
