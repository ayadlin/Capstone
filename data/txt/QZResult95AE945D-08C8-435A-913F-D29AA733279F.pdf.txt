Abstract
Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is the second most frequent pediatric bone tumor also arising in soft tissues (15% of
cases). The prognosis of patients with clinically detectable metastases at diagnosis, not responding to therapy
or with disease relapse, is still very poor. Among new therapeutic approaches, bisphosphonates represent
promising adjuvant molecules to chemotherapy to limit the osteolytic component of bone tumors and to
protect from bone metastases. The combined effects of zoledronic acid and mafosfamide were investigated
on cell proliferation, viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution of human ES cell lines differing in their
p53 and p16/ink4 status. ES models were developed to reproduce both soft tissue and intraosseous tumor
development. Mice were treated with 100 μg/kg zoledronic acid (two or four times per week) and/or ifosfamide (30 mg/kg, one to three cycles of three injections). ES cell lines showed different sensitivities to
zoledronic acid and mafosfamide at the cell proliferation level, with no correlation with their molecular
status. Both drugs induced cell cycle arrest, but in the S or G2M phase, respectively. In vivo, zoledronic
acid had no effect on soft tissue tumor progression, although it dramatically inhibited ES development in
bone. When combined with ifosfamide, zoledronic acid exerted synergistic effects in the soft tissue model:
Its combination with one cycle of ifosfamide resulted in an inhibitory effect similar to three cycles of
ifosfamide alone. This very promising result could allow clinicians to diminish the doses of chemotherapy.

Introduction
Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is the second most frequent primitive
malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents after osteosarcoma. Its frequency is around three cases per million in
people under 20 years old, with a peak incidence in the second decade of life (1). Current treatments developed in the
Euro-EWING99 protocol consist of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, local surgical resection with limb salvage, followed by
adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. These
treatments lead to a 70% overall survival, but it is less than
40% in patients with metastasis and only 15% for bone metasAuthors' Affiliations: 1Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche

tasis. Radiographs show marked osteolysis with periosteal
reaction and frequent soft tissue invasion around the primary
tumor. ES are included in the primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) sharing a chromosomal translocation involving
the EWS gene on chromosome 22 with a gene of the erythroblast transformation sequence (ETS) family (2). In 85% of
cases, the translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) occurs leading to
the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene, which behaves as an oncogene.
Bisphosphonates are PPi derivatives that selectively concentrate at the bone resorption surface (3) and induce osteoclast apoptosis, resulting in inhibition of bone resorption (4).
In addition, they inhibit tumor cell adhesion, invasion, and
proliferation, and induce apoptosis in a variety of human tumor cell lines in vitro including osteosarcoma (5–10). Among
all bisphosphonates tested, zoledronic acid, one of the thirdgeneration nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, shows
the greatest inhibitory effects on both osteoclast activity
and tumor cell proliferation (11). Quite appropriately, these
agents are increasingly used alongside anticancer treatments
to prevent skeletal complications and relieve bone pain.
Concerning primary bone tumors, zoledronic acid has been
recently combined with conventional chemotherapy and surgery in the French OS2006 phase III randomized clinical trial
for osteosarcoma treatment, after promising preclinical
results had been found on survival and tumor growth (10).
The rationale for the therapeutic use of zoledronic acid
in bone tumors is linked to the existence of a stimulatory

Zoledronic Acid Prevents Ewing's Sarcoma in Bone

feedback loop (the “vicious cycle”) between tumor cell proliferation and bone resorption during tumor development in
bone (12). Thus, zoledronic acid may have complementary
actions on bone tumors: an indirect antitumor effect by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and a direct action on tumor
cells. To date, only one preclinical study reported the therapeutic benefit of using zoledronic acid in ES, showing an inhibitory effect on osteolysis; however, no study on survival
and tumor volume has been done (13). In the present study,
in vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of
zoledronic acid on eight human ES cell lines, all expressing
the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene but differing in their molecular
characteristics (p53 mutation, p16/ink4 deletion). Then,
in vivo experiments were realized to study the effects on
tumor progression and animal survival, as a single therapeutic agent or in combination with ifosfamide, a conventional
drug used in ES clinical protocols. Two different animal models of ES were developed, reproducing both clinical behaviors
of ES: soft tissue or bone development (15% and 85%, respectively, of total ES).
The objectives were to determine the potential therapeutic efficacy of zoledronic acid alone or in combination
with chemotherapy that could help reduce the chemotherapy
dosing regimen in preclinical and then clinical protocols
for ES.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Human ES cell lines kindly provided by Dr. S. Burchill
(Children's Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom; A673, TC32,
SKES1, SKNMC, and RDES cells) or by Dr. O. Delattre (Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale U830,
Paris, France; EW24, TC71, and EW7) were used. They all
contain the EWS/FLI1 chromosomal translocation EWSFLI1 but differ in their p53 and p16/ink4 status (Supplementary Data). A673, TC32, SKES1, and RDES cells were
cultured in DMEM (BioWhittaker) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). SKNMC, EW24, TC71, EW7 cell lines were
cultured in RPMI (BioWhittaker) with 10% fetal bovine serum.
In addition, EW7 cells require type I collagen to grow.
Cell viability assay
Three thousand cells seeded in 96-well plates were treated
with 0.1 to 100 μmol/L zoledronic acid [1-hydroxy-2-(1Himidazole-1-yl) ethylidene-bisphosphonic acid supplied as the
disodium salt by Novartis Pharma AG] or 0.1 to 50 μg/mL
mafosfamide (Baxter Oncology), or by the combination of
both for 24 to 72 hours. Cellular activity was determined
by the sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate assay
(Roche Molecular Biomedicals) and measured by a Victor
multilabel plate reader (Perkin-Elmer) at 490 nm.
Trypan blue counting
Fifteen thousand cells seeded in 24-well plates were treated for 72 hours as above. Cells and culture medium were
collected after trypsinization, and trypan blue (Sigma) was

www.aacrjournals.org

added. The cells in each well were then manually counted
to determine the ratio of dead cells to viable cells.
Apoptosis analysis
Caspase-3 activity was determined using the CaspACE
assay system fluorometric kit (Promega). Fifteen thousand
cells seeded in 24-well plates were treated as described above
for 6 to 24 hours or with 1 μmol/L staurosporine for 6 hours
as a positive control before lysis. Caspase-3 activity is
reported per microgram protein as determined with copper
sulfate diluted in bicinchonic acid (both from Sigma).
Cell cycle analysis
Two hundred thousand cells were seeded in 25-cm 2
flasks, then test compounds were added for 24 to 72 hours.
Cells were collected with the supernatant and centrifuged
at 800 × g for 5 minutes. The cells in the pellet were fixed
in ethanol, centrifuged, and rinsed twice. The final pellet
was resuspended in citrate phosphate buffer, incubated for
30 minutes at room temperature, and then centrifuged.
The pellet was finally rinsed with PIB-RNase (DPBS+ Triton
X-100 + 0.5 mol/L EDTA). After 30 minutes of incubation at
37°C, 50 μg of propidium iodine were added to each tube.
After a final incubation at 4°C for 20 minutes, cell cycle analysis was performed using a FC500 flow cytometer.
Mouse models of ES
All procedures involving mice [their housing in the Experimental Therapeutic Unit at the Faculty of Medicine of
Nantes (France) and care, the method by which they were
anesthetized and killed, and all experimental protocols] were
conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines of
the French Ethical Committee (CEEA.PdL.06). Four-week-old
male athymic mice were purchased from Harlan. The soft
tissue ES model was induced by an i.m. injection of 2 × 106
ES cells next to the tibia, leading to a rapidly growing tumor
in soft tissue with secondary contiguous bone invasion. For
the bone model, the same number of cells was injected in the
medullar cavity of the tibia, leading to a slow-growing intraosseous tumor that progressively destroyed the cortical
bone and invaded the surrounding soft tissues. Mice were
anesthetized by inhalation of a combination of isoflurane/
air (1.5%, 1 L/min) and buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg; Temgésic,
Schering-Plough). Mice were randomly assigned to treatment
groups 1 day after tumor cell injection. The tumor volume
was calculated by using the formula L × (l2)/2, where L and
l are the longest and the smallest perpendicular diameter,
respectively. The mice died either spontaneously or were
killed by CO2 inhalation when the tumor volume exceeded
6,000 mm 3 . The tumor-bearing hind limb was dissected
and kept in 10% paraformaldehyde for radiography, micro–
computed tomography (micro-CT), and histologic analyses.
Dosing regimens and experimental protocols
Zoledronic acid prepared in PBS was injected s.c. at
100 μg/kg, this dose being equivalent to the clinical dose
of 4 mg every 3 to 4 weeks (14). Zoledronic acid treatment started at day 1 after tumor cell inoculation and was

administered either twice a week with a 3-day interval or on
4 consecutive days each week. Ifosfamide (ASTA Medica) was
injected i.p. at a final dose of 30 mg/kg. The first ifosfamide
sequence, starting 10 days after tumor cell injection when the
tumor was detectable, comprised a 3-day treatment with a
24-hour interval. A second and third cycle was administrated
1 and 2 weeks later depending on the protocols. The mice in
the control group were injected with an equivalent volume of
PBS. The protocol was determined in accordance with clinicians to start the treatment at a tumor stage comparable
with that of patients at their first visit to an oncologist.
Radiographic analysis
Radiographs on anesthetized animals [xylazine (Rompun)ketamine (Imalgène 500), 8% and 13%, respectively, in PBS;
100 μL/10 g] were taken every week and at necropsy with a
PLANMED Sophie mammography apparatus (SN RAH 40710).
Micro-CT analysis
Micro-CT tomography was performed with a high-resolution
X-ray micro-CT system for small-animal imaging SkyScan-1072.
Three-dimensional reconstructions were built for each hind
limb bone to quantify and compare the bone microarchitecture
parameters between control and treated animals.
Bone and tumor histology
After sacrifice, the tibiae were conserved and fixed in 10%
formalin, decalcified (PBS-EDTA), and embedded in paraffin
for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining: 4-μm
sections were cut and stained for TRAP by incubating for
1 hour in a solution of 1 mg/mL napthol-AS-TR-phosphate,
60 mmol/L N,N-dimethylformamide, 100 mmol/L sodium tartrate, and 1 mg/mL fast red TR salt solution (all from Sigma).
A hematoxylin counterstain was performed. Apoptotic cells
in primary bone tumor were determined using the in situ
cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics), based on the
terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nickend labeling (TUNEL) method. TUNEL-positive cells were
counted by microscopic examination on four to six histologic
sections per animal.
Statistical analysis
Regression models were used to assess the effect of zoledronic acid and mafosfamide on cell proliferation of each cell
line in vitro. Splines developed with generalized additive
models were used to look for nonlinear effects of both chemotherapies on each cell line (15). In case of important
departure from linearity, a log transformation was used
and linearity was assessed again. When linearity was adequate, linear regression models were constructed to independently test the effect of each chemotherapy and search for an
interaction. Nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis test) with
Dunn's post hoc test were used for the other in vitro experiments. Tumor volume averages were also compared using
the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post
hoc test. Mice survival were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier
estimator and compared with the log-rank test. The level
of statistical significance was chosen at 0.05; all tests

were bilateral. R software and Excel software were used for
these analyses.

Results
In vitro experiments
Cell viability. Figure 1A summarizes the sensitivity to
zoledronic acid and mafosfamide of eight human ES cell
lines, but no correlation with p53 status could be evidenced.
Results obtained with the A673 cell line are presented as an
example in all the forthcoming figures. A linear effect of
zoledronic acid and mafosfamide was found on A673 cell
proliferation after log transformation of the data (Fig. 1B;
P < 0.0001), revealing that sensitivity of A673 cells to zoledronic acid and mafosfamide is concentration dependent
with an IC50 of 3 μmol/L and 5 μg/mL, respectively. When
these molecules were combined, no synergistic effect on ES
cell proliferation could be shown by covariate analysis whatever the drug combination tested (Fig. 1C).
Cell death—apoptosis. Studies on cell viability were performed using trypan blue on cells treated by zoledronic acid
and mafosfamide for 72 hours. Figure 2A shows that the
proportion of dead cells increased with increasing zoledronic
acid and mafosfamide concentration. To characterize the
cell mechanisms involved in this process, apoptosis and cell
cycle were analyzed. An increase in caspase-3 activation was
observed in cells treated with both drugs but in a lower
extent with zoledronic acid than mafosfamide (Fig. 2B).
However, the use of the pangenomic caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK did not abrogate the zoledronic acid–induced
inhibition of cell proliferation (Supplementary Data). Cell
cycle distribution analyzed by flow cytometry revealed that
zoledronic acid treatment increases the proportion of A673
cells in the S phase (34% versus 18% in controls) whereas mafosfamide blocks cells in the G2M phase (84% versus 33% in
untreated cells; Fig. 2C). Therefore, this therapy combination
may overcome the potential resistance to either drug.
Experimental in vivo protocols
Two experimental models of ES were developed (in soft
tissue and in bone) to reproduce as closely as possible the
pathologic variants observed in patients. The in vivo experimental results obtained in the tumor model induced by A673
cells are presented in this article, but were confirmed in at
least another ES model (Supplementary Data).
Zoledronic acid and chemotherapy exert a synergistic
effect in the soft tissue model of ES. Zoledronic acid treatment of mice bearing ES, induced in soft tissue by using A673
or TC71 cells, did not inhibit tumor progression regardless of
the dose used (10, 50, or 100 μg/kg; two or four times a week
for 4 weeks, beginning at day 1; data not shown). Zoledronic
acid was then combined with ifosfamide following two dosing regimens (Fig. 3A): zoledronic acid (100 μg/kg twice a
week, beginning at day 1) and three courses of ifosfamide,
each consisting of three injections of 30 mg/kg ifosfamide
at 24-hour intervals beginning when the tumor was detectable (around day 10, then one course per week; left), and zoledronic acid (100 μg/kg twice a week from day 1) and one

but the combination reduced the mean tumor volume by
54% at day 25 compared with untreated animals (P < 0.01;
Fig. 3A, right), a higher extent than three courses of ifosfamide alone (Fig. 3A, left). Taken together, both these experiments show that the combination of zoledronic acid with a
single course of ifosfamide exerts a greater inhibitory effect
on tumor progression than three courses of ifosfamide alone,
suggesting that chemotherapy combined with bisphospho-

nate may allow the reduction of chemotherapy doses. Complementary radiography (Fig. 3B) and micro-CT (Fig. 3C)
analyses showed a global reduction of bone mineralization,
marked osteolysis with disruption of cortical continuity
leading to multiple fractures in untreated mice bearing ES
(Fig. 3B and C). The severity of these bone lesions was
strongly diminished in zoledronic acid–treated mice (alone
or combined with ifosfamide), indicating that zoledronic acid
protects bone from tumor-associated osteolysis. Quantitation of specific bone volume [BV/total volume (TV)]
confirmed these observations: BV/TV of tibia from zoledronic
acid– and zoledronic acid + ifosfamide–treated mice is
strongly increased (53.41% and 53.24%) compared with the
ifosfamide and untreated groups (33% and 25%, respectively;
Fig. 3C), being comparable with normal tibia (52.1%). Histology analysis confirmed the protective effect of zoledronic acid
on bone, leading to the prevention of tumor cell invasion in
the bone marrow (Fig. 3D). However, it cannot protect against
tumor progression in soft tissue; thus, chemotherapy is needed in combination with zoledronic acid in this case.
Zoledronic acid alone prevents ES development in bone.
This model closely reproduces ES development in patients,
with a slower tumor growth than that observed in the previous model in soft tissue (42 and 27 days, respectively, to
reach a tumor volume of 4,000 mm3). Figure 4A shows that
zoledronic acid alone (100 μg/kg, four times a week for
9 weeks) strongly inhibits tumor development as shown by
a 97% reduction in mean tumor volume 46 days after tumor
cell inoculation. The corresponding radiography analyses
showed that zoledronic acid protects bone from tumor cell
invasion compared with untreated animals (Fig. 4B). This
result was confirmed at the osteoclast level as revealed by
TRAP staining (Fig. 4C): Osteoclasts were clearly evident at
the tumor site in control animals but were absent in zoledronic acid–treated mice. The direct effect of zoledronic acid
on ES cell apoptosis was confirmed in vivo by increased
TUNEL staining in the tumors from the zoledronic acid–
treated group compared with untreated animals (Fig. 4D).
Zoledronic acid combined with ifosfamide prevents
tumor relapse in bone. The combination of zoledronic acid
(100 μg/kg, twice a week) and ifosfamide (3 courses of 3 ×
30 mg/kg) was tested for 4 weeks in the above-described bone
model. Zoledronic acid alone exerted a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor progression (−65%, P < 0.01 at day 30 posttumor
cell inoculation) than ifosfamide alone (−45% at the same day,
P < 0.01; Fig. 5A). Moreover, ifosfamide efficacy declined over
time, and relapse was observed from day 18. When zoledronic
acid was combined with ifosfamide, the mean tumor volume
curve could be superimposed on that of zoledronic acid alone,
suggesting that zoledronic acid combined with ifosfamide
prevents the early relapse that occurs with ifosfamide alone.
At the bone level, micro-CT analysis showed impressive
bone degradation and disorganized bone remodeling in mice
bearing ES (untreated) compared with naïve control animals
(no tumor; Fig. 5B). Animals treated with ifosfamide showed
the same extent of bone degradation. When mice were treated
with zoledronic acid alone or combined with ifosfamide, a protection from bone lesions was observed with an absence of

fractures (Fig. 5B). In these cases, the bone architecture was
conserved, even with extensive ectopic bone formation in
the zoledronic acid + ifosfamide group. These results were
confirmed by measuring TRACP5b levels in the serum of
corresponding mice. TRACP5b levels were indeed significantly
diminished in both the zoledronic acid–alone and zoledronic

controls or ifosfamide-alone groups: 4 and 6 units/L versus
12.5 and 20.5 units/L (P < 0.001; Fig. 5C), respectively.

Discussion
Among the new investigational approaches to improve
therapy in ES and OS, bone-specific agents may improve
survival and/or quality of life on “continuation” therapy. This
would include regimens with fewer short- and long-term side
effects and better results for tumors in difficult locations and
patients with recurrent disease.

Among primary bone tumors, giant cell tumors of bone are
characterized by a major osteoclastic component that justifies the clinical use of bisphosphonates in this pathology
(16). Because osteosarcoma and ES cells are metabolically
active bone cells (17, 18), studies with bisphosphonates
and more specifically nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates
have shown selective uptake and “poisoning” of these cells
(19–23). We have previously shown that zoledronic acid is
able to limit tumor progression in a rat model of osteosarcoma, to prevent tumor relapse compared with chemotherapy
alone and to prevent osteolytic lesions (10). Our results have
provided the rationale for the French randomized clinical
protocol OS2006, which combines zoledronic acid with conventional therapy for adult and pediatric patients. Since then,
other fundamental or preclinical studies have confirmed the
beneficial effect of bisphosphonates in osteosarcoma (20–25).
The limits of ES therapy in the current European protocol EuroEWING99 mainly concern patients with bone or
medullar metastases. Therefore, bisphosphonates may be

useful as adjuvant therapy to target osteoclasts and consequently to diminish the bone lesions associated with these
tumors, or to prevent the development of bone metastases
(26, 27). Very few studies specifically concern bisphosphonate
action in ES. Two previous studies have shown cytotoxic and
growth-inhibitory effects of bisphosphonates in ES/PNET cell
lines and xenograft models (21, 25, 28). Another study has
reported the inhibition of ES/PNET tumor growth by zoledronic acid, apoptosis induction, and alteration of the tumor
lytic phenotype (13). However, all cell lines used to induce ES
in these studies possess the p53 mutation and therefore are
not representative of ES tumors in which p53 mutations are
relatively uncommon (∼13% of patients; ref. 29).
We thus wanted to extend these studies by using eight human ES cell lines, all expressing the fusion gene EWS-FLI1 but
differing in their p53 (mutation) and p16/ink4 (homozygous/
hemizygous deletion) status. The results presented here, showing that all these ES cell lines were sensitive to zoledronic acid
whatever their p53 mutation or p16 deletion status, are
encouraging for treating a large cohort of ES patients. The data
on ES cell growth inhibition can be compared with others
obtained with different bisphosphonates: Sonnemann and colleagues' study showed that 50 μmol/L pamidronate reduced
cell number by up to 80% in eight ES cell lines, whereas clodronate had limited effects, reducing cell viability by maximally
40% at 1 mmol/L (28). To investigate the mechanism of action
of zoledronic acid in ES, apoptosis and cell cycle analyses were
performed. The results showed that zoledronic acid inhibits
cell viability by blocking the cell cycle in S-G2M phase, as previously described for osteosarcoma cells (30). In addition, a low
caspase-3 activation was shown in ES cells, more probably reflecting a postmitotic process linked to the cell cycle blockade
rather than a caspase-dependent mechanism. Indeed, the use
of the pangenomic caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK had no effect
on zoledronic acid–induced of ES cell proliferation.
A subsequent step was to confirm the inhibitory effects of
zoledronic acid in vivo. In patients, ES tumors mainly develop
in bone (85% of cases), but it can also occur as isolated soft
tissue tumors. Because zoledronic acid targets not only
osteoclasts but also the tumor cells themselves in vitro, this
therapy was also tested in a soft tissue model. Interestingly,
zoledronic acid strongly inhibited tumor progression in bone
(−97% after 9 weeks of treatment in the A673 model), this
result being in accordance with the beneficial effects of
bisphosphonate widely reported in several experimental
models of bone lesions associated with primary or secondary
tumors (10, 14, 31, 32). On the contrary, the same doses of
zoledronic acid had no inhibitory effect on ES progression
in soft tissue. This result is consistent with data from other
models of soft tissue tumors or visceral metastases. Indeed,
the inhibitory effect of bisphosphonate on tumor growth is
still inconsistent for soft tumors (33–35). Even at the clinical
level, few data have reported an antitumor effect of zoledronic acid against visceral metastases (36, 37), and conflicting
results have been highly discussed (38). In our ES models, it is
clear that the doses of zoledronic acid that prevented tumor
development in bone were unable to significantly influence
soft tissue tumor growth. The best efficacy of zoledronic acid

7618

in bone may be explained by the fact that bisphosphonates
concentrate in bone due to their high tropism for the calcified bone matrix. The efficacy of zoledronic acid may be
therefore potentiated in bone tissue by a dual mechanism:
antitumoral and antibone resorption activities. Higher concentrations could be tested in soft tissue models, but would
be irrelevant to clinical dosing regimens.
For many years, bisphosphonates have been used as an
adjuvant to chemotherapy in several clinical protocols (39).
In vitro and in vivo studies showed a synergistic interaction
between bisphosphonates and chemotherapeutic agents,
augmenting their efficacy (23, 25, 40, 41) and (re-)sensitizing
to chemotherapy (22), to diminish side effects or to improve
the function and quality of life (42). In our study, we showed
that zoledronic acid exerts synergistic activity with low doses
of ifosfamide in soft tissue ES, inducing the same extent of
tumor growth inhibition as high doses of ifosfamide alone.
This result suggests that chemotherapy dosing regimens could
be diminished in the presence of adjuvant bisphosphonate.
In the case of intraosseous ES tumor, zoledronic acid alone
exerted strong antitumor activity; however, when lower doses
were combined with chemotherapy, zoledronic acid seemed to
prevent the tumor recurrence observed with one course of
ifosfamide. Here, the combination of bisphosphonate with
chemotherapy again improved the therapeutic response to ES.
Because ES is characterized by marked bone resorption, therapeutics that target osteoclasts such as bisphosphonates are
promising. Our study shows, by complementary fundamental
and preclinical analyses, that zoledronic acid represents a
promising therapeutic agent for ES patients as a first-line therapy in combination with chemotherapy to limit bone lesions
and to prevent bone tumor relapse, and also as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of bone or medullary metastases. This is
particularly important in the context of the EuroEWING99 protocol, which is nearing completion, and for the choice of new
future strategies, especially for patients at high risk of relapse.
