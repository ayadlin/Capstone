Abstract

Author Manuscript

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as chronic myelogenous (CML) and chronic
myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML) are frequently induced by tyrosine kinase oncogenes.
Although these MPNs are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, patients often
relapse upon withdrawal of therapy. We used a model of MPN, which is induced by co-expression
of the oncoproteins HIP1/PDGFβR (H/P) and AML1/ETO (A/E) from their endogenous loci, to
examine the mechanisms of disease development and recurrence following imatinib withdrawal.
Although the MPN displayed a full hematologic response to imatinib, 100% of the diseased mice
relapsed upon drug withdrawal. MPN persistence was not due to imatinib resistance mutations in
the H/P oncogene or massive gene expression changes. Within one week of imatinib treatment,
more than 98% of gene expression changes induced by the oncogenes in isolated hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells (LSKs) normalized. Supplementation of imatinib with G-CSF or arsenic
trioxide reduced MPN-initiating cell frequencies and the combination of imatinib with arsenic
trioxide cured a large fraction of mice with MPNs. In contrast, no mice in the imatinib-treated
control cohorts were cured. These data suggest that treatment with a combination of arsenic
trioxide and imatinib can eliminate refractory MPN-initiating cells and reduce disease relapse.

in patients on these drugs is a significant problem [1-4]. While oncogenic tyrosine kinase
inhibition with imatinib has led to reduced mortality rates for patients with BCR-ABL
associated CML [5] and PDGFβR mutant associated CMML [6, 7], a majority of treated
patients still have malignant cells that expand into frank disease when drug is discontinued
[5, 8]. TKI resistance mutations, amplification of kinase transcripts, reduction of
intracellular TKI concentrations or lack of addiction to the oncogenic kinase are all possible
mechanisms that enable persistence of TKI treated MPN-initiating cells.

Author Manuscript

Although the characteristics of MPN-initiating cells in CML and CMML have not been fully
elucidated, these cells are thought to share many phenotypic characteristics with
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), including self-renewal, multi-potency and quiescence [9].
Studies of the CD34+ fraction of CML samples in culture have found that quiescent cells are
insensitive to imatinib [10] and become sensitive upon addition of high concentrations of
growth factors that promote hematopoietic proliferation and mobilization [11, 12]. The
molecular mechanisms underlying the enhancement of a cell’s sensitivity to imatinib by cell
cycle entry are not known. There is only suggestive in vivo data with interferon-alpha
indicating that the imatinib therapeutic index may be improved with hematopoietic
mobilization in individuals with MPNs. Interferon-alpha has pleiotropic cellular effects,
including mobilizing activity, and it has been tested as a TKI supplement in humans with
CML with favorable outcomes [13]. These limited in vivo data indicate that further studies
in mice and humans of HSC mobilizers as additives to continuous imatinib therapy are
warranted [13].

We have used a tyrosine kinase oncogene-induced MPN mouse model, which expresses the
combination of H/P and AML1/ETO (A/E) oncogenes from conditional knock-in alleles to
probe the mechanism(s) of disease persistence in the presence of imatinib [14]. The H/P
oncogene is expressed as a result of a t(5;7) chromosomal translocation and is a member of a
large family of mutations that involve translocations with the PDGFβR gene, which lead to
CMML. There are at least 20 different chromosomal translocation partners for the PDGFβR
tyrosine kinase found in CMML [15-17]. Recently, a recurrent PDGFβR mutation, EBF1PDGFβR, was also identified in Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic
leukemias [18]. The A/E oncogene is expressed as a result of the t(8:21) chromosomal
translocation and is frequently found in M2 type acute myeloid leukemias [19]. A/E has not
only been reported in a patient with a PDGFβR mutation [20], but and is also frequently
present in neoplasms that co-express other tyrosine kinase mutations such as aberrant c-Kit,
JAK2 or Flt-3 [18, 21]. Furthermore, AML1 (aka RUNX1) mutations are the most frequent
aberrations found in patients with progressed CML [22]. The H/P;A/E combination knock-in
model is useful because the knock-in alleles express single copies of the human oncogenes
from their endogenous loci resulting in a rapid onset, uniform MPN allowing for therapeutic
studies of large numbers of mice with neoplasia in an immune-competent syngeneic
background [14]. We used this knock-in model of MPN to investigate cellular and molecular
changes contributing to disease persistence in the presence of TKIs and to discover if
alternative treatment options are more effective than imatinib therapy alone.

RESULTS
MPN-initiating cells in the H/P;A/E MPN model survive imatinib treatment

Author Manuscript

We have previously reported that 100% of Mx1-Cre; Hip1LSL-HP;Aml1LSL-AE (H/P;A/E)
mice rapidly develop an aggressive, imatinib-responsive MPN following activation of the
“knocked-in” human oncogenes [14]. However, we found that the bone marrow in imatinibtreated H/P;A/E mice still contained MPN-initiating cells as assayed by successful bone
marrow transplantation of imatinib treated disease into lethally irradiated syngeneic
recipients. Whether the remaining MPN-initiating cells were sufficient to cause relapse post
drug withdrawal was not known. To answer this, we maintained a cohort of H/P;A/E mice in
disease remission with imatinib for four weeks and then a group were taken off therapy. All
mice were sacrificed one week after imatinib withdrawal and found to have splenomegaly
(Figure 1A, left) and decreased long-term HSC (LT-HSCs) frequencies, a previously
characterized hallmark of the H/P;A/E MPN [14] (Figure 1A, right). Irrespective of how
long the mice were maintained on imatinib (longest continuous treatment to date has been
six months), relapse was observed post drug withdrawal, indicating that enough MPNinitiating cells survived imatinib therapy to cause relapse. This same relapse phenomenon
was observed with the use of the more potent cousin of imatinib, nilotinib (Figure 1B).
These data further support the observation that TKI treatment suppresses the H/P;A/E MPN
but does not cure the disease.

Author Manuscript

Analysis of peripheral blood upon re-treatment with the same dose of imatinib in previously
relapsed H/P;A/E mice indicated that the MPN-initiating cells remained sensitive to the
same dose of therapy following relapse (Figure 1C, left). The drug sensitivity was also
present in diseased mice that were started on imatinib prior to disease onset, in an original
attempt to prevent disease altogether (Figure 1C, right, Table S1). Upon discontinuation of
imatinib therapy in this “prevention” cohort of mice, disease incidence remained 100%,
indicating that imatinib does not prevent the disease. In fact, we have sequenced the knockin
allele from two different Hip1+/LSL-H/P spleens after a month of imatinib therapy and have
not identified de novo mutations in the H/P sequence. H/P transcript levels in bone marrow
from imatinib treated mice did not show increased H/P expression compared to vehicle
treated mice (Figure 1D). These data suggest that de novo H/P TKI resistance mutations or
oncogene amplifications conferring resistance to TKIs were not the cause of imatinib
refractoriness.
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell alterations during H/P;A/E-induced MPN normalize
with imatinib therapy

Next, we sought to characterize the MPN-initiating cells responsible for disease relapse and
persistence. We initially used MRP8-Cre transgenic mice to drive oncogene expression
solely in late granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMP) [23] and observed that H/P;A/E
induced MPNs did not develop in mice that express the oncogenes even in those mice that
were aged for 2 years (data not shown and Figure S1). This suggested that the MPNinitiating cells originate from the LT-HSCs or the earliest progenitors, such as short-term
HSCs (ST-HSCs), multipotent progenitors (MPPs), or common myeloid progenitors
(CMPs). Additionally, we performed transplantation of Lineage−Kit+ (LK) (contains CMP,

GMP, MEP) and LSK (containing LT-HSC, ST-HSC and MPP) bone marrow fractions into
lethally irradiated mice and found that only the LSK population transferred disease
suggesting that CMPs are unlikely to contain MPN-initiating cells (Table 1). To investigate
whether an abnormal sub-population of progenitors persisted within the LSK in the presence
of imatinib as a candidate MPN-initiating cell, we analyzed the frequency of early
progenitors in the LSK population with and without imatinib treatment and found that all
MPN-associated abnormalities such as decreased MPPs and LT-HSCs and relative increase
in ST-HSCs resolved with imatinib (Figure 2A). This complete resolution of early
progenitor abnormalities in the presence of imatinib prevented identification of a single
persistent MPN-initiating cell population using this analysis.

We next attempted to determine which cells persisted in the presence of imatinib by using a
chimeric CD45.1/CD45.2 transplant system that permits the analysis of mice with the H/P
and A/E oncogenes expressed in only a fraction of the hematopoietic cell compartment.
With the expression of these two different isotypes of the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45
(CD45.1 and CD45.2), we were able to differentiate between the recipient and donor
populations. After engraftment of a 1:1 mix of un-induced Mx1-Cre;H/P;A/E CD45.2 to
wild type CD45.1 cells, the degree of chimerism was stable at 1:1 (CD45.2:CD45.1), and no
differences in blood counts or spleen weights between Creneg and Mx1-Cre;H/P;A/E mice
were observed. The MPN was then induced with pIpC activation of Mx1-Cre and, as
expected, CD45.2 donor cell chimerism approached 100% as the MPN developed (see
sample plots in Figure S2A, Figure 2B). Unexpectedly, after one month of imatinib therapy,
the fraction of donor cells (CD45.2) versus recipient cells (CD45.1) in the bone marrow
returned to starting ratios of approximately 1:1 with the exception of the donor LSK
population, which persisted at a statistically significantly higher frequency than starting
frequencies no matter how long mice were maintained on imatinib (Figure 2B). There was a
trend for the other myeloid populations (whole bone marrow, LK and Gr1+Mac1+) to
persist, as well, but none of these differences from the control were statistically significant.
Even after longer treatment courses of two mice with 150 days of imatinib therapy, a 1:1
ratio of donor and recipient cells in most bone marrow progenitor compartments remained
steady without significant differences from each other, with exception of the slight increase
in the LSK population (data not shown). These data are consistent with the assertion that
without tyrosine kinase signaling, H/P;A/E MPN-initiating cells are inhibited from
generating a full blown MPN but are not eliminated, and in fact differentiate into terminally
differentiated hematopoietic cells similar to the differentiation of surrounding wild type LTHSCs.

Imatinib inhibits hyperproliferation of progenitors from H/P;A/E mouse bone marrow
Because the donor (CD45.2) percentage of the LSK population was elevated compared to
other progenitors in the chimera assay (Figure 2B), we examined if these cells demonstrated
hyperproliferation during imatinib therapy. Control or diseased mice were treated with
vehicle or imatinib before intraperitoneal injection with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), which
labels 6% of HSCs in normal bone marrow in 24 hours [24]. The mice were sacrificed at 24
hours and bone marrow cells were analyzed for BrdU incorporation. LSK cells from
H/P;A/E mice showed a two-fold increase in BrdU incorporation (p<0.04) compared to

controls (Figure 2C). However, the frequency of BrdU incorporation in LSKs from H/P;A/E
mice returned to control frequencies in the presence of imatinib (Figure 2C). These data
indicate that diseased cells within the LSK compartment are hyperproliferative as a result of
H/P;A/E signaling but that these cells return to baseline rates of proliferation in the presence
of imatinib.
Gene expression changes in LSKs from H/P;A/E mice lead to the identification of a mastcell specific signature

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To identify whether molecular factors contributed to the persistence of MPN-initiating cells,
we sought to determine disease-related molecular changes in LSKs in the presence of
imatinib. To do this, we compared the gene expression profiles of the Flt3−Lin−Sca+Kit+
(Flt3−LSK) cells in the presence or absence of imatinib. We isolated Flt3−LSK cells from
the bone marrow of healthy (Creneg) control mice, diseased (H/P;A/E) mice, or imatinibtreated diseased mice (Imatinib treated–H/P;A/E) and performed RNA expression analysis
using Affymetrix arrays. We selected the LSK population of stem and progenitor cells to test
in the presence of imatinib because they remained slightly elevated in the imatinib treated
chimeric mice (Figure 2B) and were able to transfer the disease into lethally irradiated
recipients whereas the more mature progenitor populations did not (Table 1). Mx1-Cre
induced H/P;A/E-expression in Flt3−LSK cells led to significant (p<0.01; 2-tailed t-test)
changes (2-fold or greater compared to Creneg control) in 355 genes, 82% of which were
down-regulated. Further, of these 355 genes, 98% were completely restored to their basal
levels upon treatment with a one-week imatinib course (Table S2). This indicated that the
majority of disease-associated changes could be rapidly resolved with imatinib. The 355
altered genes did not group into significant pathways including those predicted to be
downstream of tyrosine kinases. We used a variety of pathway analysis tools that included
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Wiki-pathways as well as manual curation and inspection.
There were nine gene expression changes that were shared with a recently published 95 gene
MPN-initiating cell signature obtained from JunB knockout mice with MPNs [25]. Again,
these nine genes did not fall into a single pathway. Because these shared gene changes
(highlighted in green in Table S2) resolved with imatinib therapy, we did not investigate
them further.

Author Manuscript

Out of the two percent of altered messages that did not show complete resolution in
imatinib-treated diseased mice, we found four genes that exhibited a greater than 10-fold
increase in expression compared to control Creneg LSK cells (Table 2; Pla2g7, Cpa3, Ms4a2
and Gp49a). All of these genes are expressed specifically in mast cells [26-29]. After longer
term treatment (four weeks) with imatinib, the expression levels of the mast cell genes in
LSK cells normalized to Creneg control levels, suggesting that these mast cell-like diseased
progenitor cells are eventually cleared (data not shown).
Because we observed elevated expression of mast cell specific genes in the LSK population
after short-term imatinib treatment, we assessed the frequency of mature mast cells in
diseased H/P;A/E and control Creneg mice. Indeed, the mast cell frequencies, as measured
by elevated numbers of CD117(c-kit)+,FcεRI+,GP49+ cells, increased 10-fold in the
peripheral blood (Figure 2D). Following a two-week course of imatinib or mock treatments,

peripheral blood was analyzed for mast cell frequencies and the percentage of CD117(ckit)+,FcεRI+,GP49+ mast cells in the peripheral blood of imatinib-treated diseased mice
resolved. These findings suggest that these newly identified malignant mast cells and their
progenitors do not persist in the presence of imatinib. Therefore, the expression array
analysis using the LSK population did not identify persistent gene expression patterns that
contributed to imatinib refractoriness.
HSCs and Other Progenitors Do Not Display CD47 Upregulation during Imatinib Treatment

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A potential mechanism for imatinib refractoriness is MPN-initiating cell evasion of normal
immunosurveillance. Normal HSCs upregulate surface expression of the phagocytosis
resistance marker CD47 in response to hematopoietic mobilizing stimuli (e.g.,
lipopolysaccharide [LPS] and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), and this
expression protects HSCs from macrophage-mediated phagocytosis during peripheral
migration [30]. The authors of the latter study hypothesized that LICs may use this normal
physiologic process to evade therapy. In their study, CD47 was upregulated on stem,
progenitor, and Mac1+ cells in an Mrp8-BcrAbl/Bcl2 transgenic mouse model of CML [31,
32]; however, those mice progressed to blast crisis and it is not known when during disease
progression CD47 expression increased. To test this hypothesis in the H/P;A/E model of
CML, we measured the CD47-FITC fluorescence intensity of various cell populations of
Creneg control mice as well as of cells from vehicle- and imatinib-treated H/P;A/E mice. The
largest increase of CD47 staining was detected in the LSK compartment (Figure 3A, black
bars, p<0.05); however, imatinib treatment reduced CD47 expression to Creneg control
levels in this population (grey bars). In fact, no consistent elevation of CD47 in the LT-HSC
population that contains the most leukemogenic cells was observed even in the absence of
imatinib treatment. These data suggest that no unique leukemogenic cell population is
marked by CD47 expression for protection from peripheral phagocytosis as a mechanism of
MPN-initiating cell persistence. Immune evasion by increasing expression of CD47 does not
underlie MPN-initiating cell persistence in this mouse model of MPN.
Signal Transduction Molecules in Spleens from Imatinib-Treated Diseased Mice Displayed
a Delayed Recovery Compared to Histology

Author Manuscript

Because constitutive signaling by the H/P oncogene was expected due to its constitutive
activity in BaF3 cells [33], we tested extracts of spleens from diseased vehicle and imatinib
treated mice for altered downstream signaling events as represented by PTEN, AKT, STAT5
or MAPK phosphorylation. Distinct changes in expression of several of these proteins in the
diseased spleens compared to wild-type spleens were observed and were initially assumed to
result from a change in the cellular composition of the diseased spleens to that of primarily
terminally differentiated neutrophils; however, 10 days of imatinib treatment restored the
gross phenotype of the spleens, but the molecular alterations did not resolve. For example,
AKT and STAT5 were present in wild type spleens but not detected in spleen extracts from
mice with MPNs treated with imatinib for 10 days (Figure S3). PTEN was present in the
diseased spleens but a new faster migrating protein band was also observed (Figure 3B,
Vehicle). It is quite possible that this band represents the cleaved caspase-3 PTEN product
identified previously [34]. In contrast, MAPK and actin were not consistently altered. Mouse

HIP1 and HIP1-related, recently found to be substrates of PDGFRβ fusion oncogenes [35]
were also deficient in the diseased spleens (Figure S3).

Author Manuscript

Upon longer treatment with imatinib (25 days), the spleen histology (Figure 3B, bottom),
weight and WBC parameters as well as the AKT and STAT5 levels were no different than
those found in wild type mice (Figure S3). Despite these apparent signs of physical and
molecular normalcy, western blot analysis continued to demonstrate the PTEN alteration.
However, the amount of this “cleavage” product was much reduced. These data indicate that
the faster migrating PTEN band may be a reliable marker of residual disease in imatinibtreated mice. It is tempting to speculate that this PTEN product may have dominant negative
activity leading to deficient PTEN inhibition of the PtdIns3-kinase pathway. However, this
hypothetical mechanism for promotion of MPN-initiating cell survival in the presence of
tyrosine kinase inhibition is untested. Investigating this hypothesis further by sorting out
what cells in the spleen express this PTEN product, defining what this product is, and
determining its enzymatic activity will be important future steps.
G-CSF and arsenic trioxide synergize with imatinib to reduce MPN-initiating cells

Author Manuscript

Because imatinib did not cure the H/P;A/E mice, we screened drugs that were readily
available from the clinic pharmacy for therapeutic effects in our mice. In addition to
availability, we chose drugs that, based on previously reported activity in leukemias, may be
alternatives to imatinib or have synergy with imatinib in the H/P;A/E mice. We initially
screened the histone deacetylase inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)
(recently shown to synergize with imatinib in a BCR/ABL transgenic model of leukemia
[36]), Rapamycin (mTor inhibitor), GM-CSF (promotes differentiation of myeloid
progenitors [37]), G-CSF (promotes hematopoietic mobilization [38]) and arsenic trioxide
(promotes both differentiation and mobilization of hematopoietic cells [39]). None of these
agents demonstrated anti-MPN activity when used as test treatments for the H/P;A/E MPN.
We then tested their ability to potentiate imatinib therapy by determining whether or not
they prevented disease transfer from imatinib treated mice into lethally irradiated recipient
mice. This assay is considered a surrogate of MPN-initiating cell activity. From this drug
screen, G-CSF and arsenic trioxide showed promise.

Author Manuscript

We initially used a Cyclophosphamide/G-CSF (Cy/G) HSC “mobilization” regimen to
supplement imatinib [38]. As mentioned earlier, one potential mechanism by which LICs
evade kinase inhibitor therapy is by “hiding” in a specific cellular state, such as quiescence
[1, 40]; analogous to the mechanism by which normal HSCs avoid chemotherapeutic
toxicity. Mice were divided into two groups: one group received mock injections and the
other received injections of Cy/G in the presence of imatinib. Both groups were treated with
14-days of imatinib pre-treatment for a hematologic response and then imatinib plus mock
or Cy/G injections occurred (“mock” and “Cy/G;” Figure 4A). All mice were continuously
treated with another 10 days of imatinib following mobilization. After the five-day imatinib
supplementation, shifts in peripheral blood myeloid populations were observed in all Cy/G
treated mice; consistent with the fact that G-CSF induces myeloid differentiation and
mobilization from the bone marrow. No significant hematological differences were detected
between the mobilized and mock groups of donor animals at the end of the 29-day treatment

course (Figure S4). After therapy, bone marrow and spleen cells were then transplanted into
the lethally irradiated recipients as described previously [14]. As expected, a significant
number (25%) of transplant recipient mice that received five million bone marrow cells from
imatinib-only treated H/P;A/E donor mice developed an MPN (Table 3 and Figure 4B). In
contrast, the addition of Cy/G to imatinib therapy led to an almost complete abrogation of
disease transfer even at the highest transferred dose (Table 3 and Figure 4B, five million
cells, left hand panel). Similar results were also obtained using spleen cells as transplant
material (Table 3 and Figure 4B, right hand panel). Further, when tested alone, G-CSF, but
not Cytoxan, eliminated transplantable MPN-initiating cells (Table 3). These findings
suggest that G-CSF reduces MPN-initiating cell frequencies when used in combination with
imatinib.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In addition to measuring the effects of supplemental G-CSF on imatinib activity in MPNinitiating cells, we also treated a cohort of mice with imatinib and 14 days of supplemental
arsenic trioxide, a drug with complex effects. One effect of arsenic trioxide treatment is
bone marrow mobilization and it has been reported that arsenic supplementation of cytosine
arabinoside (ara-C) chemotherapy improved elimination of MPN-initiating cells [39].
Similar to what was observed with G-CSF supplementation of imatinib, we observed disease
did not effectively transplant when arsenic trioxide was added to imatinib (Table 3).
Limiting dilution calculations indicate that imatinib treated mice have an MPN-initiating cell
frequency of 1/14,000,000 bone marrow cells. The groups treated with either imatinib plus
CyG or imatinib plus arsenic had significantly lower frequencies, resulting in over a 15-fold
and 7-fold decrease in frequency of MPN-initiating cells in the bone marrow, respectively.
These data indicate that a reduction of MPN-initiating cells, as assayed by disease transfer,
can be achieved by the supplementation of continuous imatinib therapy with Cy/G-CSF, GCSF or arsenic trioxide.
Addition of arsenic trioxide to imatinib results in reduction of disease relapse

Author Manuscript

Although these transplantation studies support the idea that G-CSF and arsenic trioxide can
reduce MPN-initiating cell frequency, it is not clear from these studies whether or not these
combined therapies eliminate enough MPN-initiating cells to be of clinical use. We
generated large cohorts of mice with MPNs for these relapse experiments by transplanting a
50:50 mix of wild type and un-induced Mx1-Cre;H/P;A/E cells into lethally irradiated
recipient mice. Mice were then treated with pIpC and developed an MPN within 30 days of
induction. MPN-bearing mice were then treated for 14 days with imatinib to obtain a
hematologic response and then imatinib was supplemented with Cy/G-CSF or arsenic
trioxide. Mice were evaluated for relapse 28 days after all treatment was discontinued
(Figure 5A). The addition of Cy/G-CSF to imatinib resulted in no effect on relapse rate or
frequency (Figure 5B) despite imatinib’s ability to reduce transplantable MPN-initiating
cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, addition of arsenic trioxide to imatinib did prevent relapse.
The initial cohort of mice treated with imatinib or imatinib plus arsenic trioxide resulted in a
cure of 5 out of the 14 imatinib plus arsenic-treated mice (35.7% vs. 0% imatinib alone;
p<0.001) as measured by no evidence of MPN three months after drug withdrawal (Figure
5C). Necropsies showed normal spleens, peripheral blood and bone marrow progenitor cell
frequencies. These results were observed again in a second validation cohort of diseased

mice. In this case, the combined treatment of imatinib and arsenic trioxide led to disease
eradication in an even larger fraction of the mice, an effect that was again not seen in any of
the mice treated with imatinib alone (Figure 5D). At the end of the second experiment, all
imatinib/mock treated mice showed evidence of MPN. Conversely, only one-fourth (n=3/12)
of the imatinib/arsenic trioxide treated mice showed evidence of an MPN. Collectively, data
from these two assays for MPN-initiating cell persistence, transplant and disease relapse,
indicate that these two compounds, G-CSF and even more effective, arsenic, enhance the
ability of imatinib to eradicate MPN-initiating cells.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Previous studies indicate that patients diagnosed with both BCR/ABL and PDGFβR mutant
chronic myeloid leukemias and maintained on imatinib are not cured of their disease [1, 6-8,
41]. Very few patients achieve major molecular remissions on imatinib or nilotinib, and
most experience relapse upon drug discontinuation [5, 8]. Upon therapy re-initiation, disease
is usually suppressed, indicating that de novo TKI resistance mutations in tyrosine kinase
oncogenes do not contribute to the majority of drug refractoriness. These observations
suggest that while TKI therapies result in the eradication of a large number of cancerous
cells, they do not eliminate MPN-initiating cells that maintain the disease. It would be a
relief for patients currently maintained on chronic TKI therapy if new therapies that abolish
MPN-initiating cells to yield more cures and allow for drug discontinuation were developed.

Author Manuscript

With multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that imatinib therapy suppresses but does not
cure the MPN in the H/P;A/E mice (Figure 1), we investigated potential mechanisms of
MPN-initiating cell persistence. Tyrosine kinase resistance mutations were not a likely
cause, as disease relapse was successfully re-treated with the same dose of imatinib or
nilotinib (Figure 1A-D). We originally postulated that imatinib leads to the eradication of
MPN-initiating cell progeny but not the MPN-initiating cell itself (Figure 5, Situation I).
However, we observed that the oncogene expressing cells were present in all progenitors
during imatinib therapy, indicating normal hematopoiesis was not inhibited (Figure 2B,
Situation II). These data are consistent with a report by Corbin and colleagues where
cultured human Bcr/Abl-expressing CD34+ cells also displayed normal hematopoiesis in the
presence of imatinib [42]. The ultimate goal is therefore to convert the cytostatic effect of
imatinib (Figure 5, Situation II) into a cytotoxic effect (Figure 5, Situation III).

Author Manuscript

In another attempt to understand why MPN-initiating cells in our H/P;A/E model of MPN
persist in the presence of TKIs, we studied gene expression in untreated and imatinib treated
LSK cells from H/P; A/E mice. LSKs were tested because they were able to transplant the
MPNs into lethally irradiated mice (Table 1). The majority of the 355 genes (82%) with
altered expression in the H/P;A/E expressing LSK cells were down-regulated. Ninety-eight
percent of these changes resolved with one week of imatinib therapy and there was complete
resolution within four weeks of imatinib therapy. We also observed decreased protein
expression of AKT, PI3K, STAT5 and the HIP1 family in diseased spleen extracts. These
RNA and protein data led us to speculate that the constitutively active H/P tyrosine kinase
by using ATP continuously may serve as an energy sink for the cell. This would lead the cell
to conserve its limited ATP and decrease overall protein and RNA synthesis to the bare

necessities. These data suggest that the disease transferring cells in the LSK population do
not express a hallmark gene signature that helps explain the mechanism(s) of MPN-initiating
cell persistence.
Another possible mechanism of MPN-initiating cell persistence involves evasion from
immunosurveillance. Based on previous reports, the hematopoietic surface marker CD47 is
upregulated in myeloid leukemias, and by binding its receptor SIRPα on macrophages, this
surface protein provides protection from phagocytosis [30]. In the H/P;A/E-induced MPN,
CD47 was indeed upregulated on LSK stem/early progenitor-like cells. However, surface
CD47 levels returned to wild type levels upon a response to imatinib. These data suggest
that immune evasion via persistence of upregulated CD47 expression is not the principal
mechanism of MPN-initiating cell persistence in this model of MPN.

Because there was no distinct mechanism for disease persistence identified, we chose to
screen a selection of drugs readily available in the clinic for 1) intrinsic anti-MPN activity or
2) synergistic activity with imatinib. We screened SAHA (HDAC inhibitor), Rapamycin
(MTor inhibitor), GM-CSF, G-CSF and arsenic trioxide and did not observe anti-MPN
activity. However, we found that G-CSF and arsenic trioxide enhanced imatinib’s ability to
reduce MPN-initiating cells (Figure 6, situation III). Both of these agents have HSC
mobilization activities suggesting that other HSC mobilizers such as AMD3100 [43] could
also synergize with imatinib warranting investigation into such therapeutic activity in the
future. However, a recent report of AMD3100 and CNS toxicity by Agarwal and colleagues
is a concern [44]. In this study of a model of CML with retroviral expression of BCR/ABL,
the combination of BCR/ABL kinase inhibition and plerixaflor (AMD3100) failed to be
synergistic against leukemia and was, in fact, neurotoxic due to CNS invasion by CML cells
[44].
The G-CSF data are consistent with previous data indicating that cultured CD34+ cells from
CML patients have a cytostatic response to imatinib that becomes cytotoxic when
proliferative cytokines, such as G-CSF, are added to the culture media [10-12]. A recent
“negative” clinical trial of combined imatinib and G-CSF in CML was distinct from our
suggested protocol as it did not test treatment of patients with continuous imatinib during the
G-CSF phase of therapy [45]. It is possible that this treatment schedule may not be optimal.
However, even in our mouse model, relapse rate was not altered by G-CSF supplementation
of imatinib but was altered by arsenic trioxide supplementation of imatinib.

Author Manuscript

Further analysis of arsenic and other mobilizers in the clinic is quite feasible as oncologists
are already familiar with its FDA approved use for patients with acute promyelocytic
leukemia [46]. Ito and colleagues have reported results supporting the assertion that the
mobilizing activity of arsenic trioxide is what is responsible for their observed improved
elimination of CML-initiating cells by ara-C when supplemented with arsenic trioxide [39].
Also, a phase I/II trial for TKI-resistant accelerated or acute phase CML, which compared
imatinib in the presence or absence of arsenic, is listed on the NCI trial web site
(clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT00053248) but the rationale/results for this trial have not
been reported. Future studies that investigate the efficacy of supplementing imatinib or its
cousins with arsenic trioxide to cure rather than suppress disease in individuals with MPNs

are warranted. The characterization and drug targeting of MPN-initiating cells by using such
models as the H/P;A/E mice treated with imatinib and arsenic trioxide have the potential to
contribute to the identification and preclinical testing of new therapies for patients with
MPNs such as CML and CMML.

METHODS
Mice and transplant model
The pIpC induction of disease in the Mx1-Cre;Hip1+/LSL-H/P;Aml1+/LSL-A/E mouse has been
described previously [14]. The Hip1+/LSL-H/P mice have been donated to the Jackson
Laboratory. MRP8-CreIRESgfp (Dr. Irv Weissman, Stanford) mice were crossed with
Hip1+/LSL-H/P;Aml1+/LSL-A/E mutant mice. Mice were genotyped as described previously
[14].

Author Manuscript

For transplant experiments, donor mice were on a C57Bl/6 (CD45.2) genetic background.
For bone marrow transplant, B6.SJL-Ptprc<a>Pepc<b>/BoyJ (SJL) recipient mice (CD45.1,
Jackson Labs #002014) were irradiated twice (520 rads each time) separated by 3 hours.
Donor cells (CD45.2) and radioprotective or recipient cells (CD45.2) were co-injected retroorbitally within 24 h of the second dose of irradiation. Creneg;H/P;A/E donors were used as
a control for the heterozygous state of the Hip1 and Aml1 loci. The proportion of each cell
population that was donor-derived was represented as a percentage calculated as ([CD45.2]/
[CD45.1+CD45.2])x100. Mice were housed in the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and were monitored regularly for
evidence of morbidity and/or abnormal peripheral blood cell counts.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometric analyses of progenitor frequencies (BD FACS-Canto) and sorting of
Flt3−LSKs (BD FACS-AriaII) for array analysis were performed as described previously
[47]. BrdU incorporation studies and Annexin V staining were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences). Peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen
cells from imatinib or mock treated Mx1-Cre;H/P;A/E MPN mice and controls were
analyzed for CD117(c-kit)+, FcεRI +, GP49+ mast cells. Mast cell specific antibodies
(CD117 clone 2B8, FcεR1 clone MAR-1 and GP49 clone H1.1) were acquired from
eBioscience.

Author Manuscript

For analysis of engraftment and chimerism, peripheral blood was collected from the
submandibular plexus and analyzed for CD45.1 and CD45.2 as previously described [47].
Bone marrow samples from wild type C57BL/6 (CD45.2) and wild type SJL (CD45.1) mice
were analyzed in parallel to set the appropriate flow cytometry gates for CD45 expression.
The degree of chimerism was calculated by dividing the number of CD45.2-positive donor
cells by the total number of cells expressing either CD45 marker ([CD45.2]/
[CD45.1+CD45.2]) to exclude non-hematopoietic CD45 negative cells from the analysis.

Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

Spleen extracts were prepared and subjected to western analysis as described previously
[48]. For each lane, 75 μg of extract was subjected to SDS-6% or 10% polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The antibodies were as follows:
polyclonal anti-HIP1 UM354 (1:5000, Assay Designs, Inc.), monoclonal anti-HIP1r (IC5),
polyclonal anti-PTEN (1:1000, Cell Signaling), polyclonal anti- AKT (1:1000, Cell
Signaling), polyclonal anti-Stat5 (1:200, Santa Cruz), polyclonal anti- MAPK (1:1000, Cell
Signaling), polyclonal anti-phospho-MAPK (p42/p44, 1:1000, Cell Signaling) and
polyclonal anti-actin (1:1000, Sigma).
RNA samples and isolation

Author Manuscript

For bone marrow expression arrays 10,000 Flt3−LSKs from bone marrow of the various
experimental mice (Creneg;H/P;A/E, Mx1-Cre;H/P;A/E untreated; Mx1-Cre;H/P;A/E treated
with one week of twice daily imatinib and a second cohort with four weeks of imatinib)
were sorted directly into TRIzol (Ambion) or RNAlater (Life technologies) and RNA was
isolated using TRIzol according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative PCR

Author Manuscript

Mice with H/P;A/E MPNs were treated with imatinib or mock for one month, twice daily
and bone marrow was harvested from both femurs or from spleens. Splenic and bone
marrow RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations were quantified in triplicate with the
Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Two μg total RNA was used to
synthesize the first cDNA strand with the SuperScriptTM III First-Strand Synthesis System
for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The Sybr Green quantitative reaction was carried out according to
the manufactures instructions with primers specific for H/P, murine HIP1, GAPDH and
HPRT.
cDNA synthesis and labeling
For each chip, RNA from 30,000 Flt3−LSKs (bone marrow cells sorted from three mice
were combined) was amplified, converted to cDNA and fragmented and labeled using the
Ovation RNA Amplification V2 and Encore Biotin Module kits according to the
manufacturer’s instruction (NuGEN, San Carlos CA).
Oligonucleotide array hybridization and analysis

Author Manuscript

Labeled fragmented cDNA (4.4 ug) was hybridized for 18 hr at 45oC to Affymetrix Mouse
Genome 430 2.0 short oligomer arrays, which detect approximately 44,000 mouse
transcripts representing over 34,000 well-characterized mouse genes and ests (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA). Arrays were washed and stained using a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix)
according to the manufacturer’s recommended procedures. The arrays were stained with
phycoerythrein-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the fluorescence
intensities were determined using a GCS 3000 7G high-resolution confocal laser scanner
and AGCC software (Affymetrix). The scanned images were analyzed using Expression
Console v2.0 software (Affymetrix). Quality control metrics for cRNA integrity, sample

loading and variations in staining were determined after background correction and signal
summarization by MAS5.0 statistical algorithms resident in GCOS and standardization of
each array by global scaling the average of the fluorescent intensities of all genes on an
array to a constant mean target intensity of 250.
Array data analysis

Author Manuscript

Expression data were analyzed following background correction, probe set signal
summarization and normalization by MAS5.0 with global scaling (TGT=250), RMA and/or
PLIER [49]. Pairwise comparisons of single arrays were performed by MAS 5.0 in GCOS.
Probe sets exhibiting significant differential expression were identified using GeneMaths
XT (Applied Maths, Austin TX), based on the following criteria: 1) MAS5.0 detection pvalues ,0.5 for all samples in at least one experimental group, 2) ANOVA p-value < 0.05, 3)
Absolute Signal log ratio > 1.0 and independent t-test p-value < 0.05 for at least one
pairwise comparison versus the control cre negative disease-free group. Gene annotation
was obtained from the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), NetAffx (ww.affymetrix.com), the
Gene Ontology Consortium (http://amigo.geneontology.org), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (www.genome.jp/kegg), and WebGestalt (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/
webgestalt).
Drug preparation

Author Manuscript

Imatinib pills were dissolved in water and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and
brought to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml (100 μl doses). Nilotinib (Tasigna, Novartis)
was dissolved in 10% NMP/90% PEG-300 and administered once daily at a dose of 100
mg/kg by oral gavage. The cyclophosphamide/G-CSF (Cy/G) protocol for HSC mobilization
has been previously described [38]. Briefly, during imatinib therapy, mice were injected
intraperitoneally with 4 mg Cyclophosphamide (Cy;Bristol-Myers Squibb). G-CSF was then
administered for 4 consecutive days by subcutaneous injection (5 μg/mouse; 100 μl of a 5
μg/100μl solution; approx. 250 μg/Kg). Arsenic Trioxide was administered with daily i.p.
injections for 14 consecutive days (10 μg in 100 μl per 20 g mouse). Imatinib (Gleevec), Cy
(Cytoxan), G-CSF (Neupogen), and arsenic (Trisenox) were purchased or graciously
donated to the laboratory from the hospital pharmacy.

re-starting imatinib therapy 48 days later. Right, WBC from a representative mouse in which
imatinib therapy was initiated as “prevention” therapy shortly after (10 days) pIpC
treatment. A total of 10 H/P;A/E mice were put on a two-month course of imatinib therapy
given twice daily immediately after pIpC induction. Drug was then discontinued. Disease
was indicated by elevated levels of WBCs in the peripheral blood. All 10 mice given
“preventative treatment” presented with disease within two weeks of drug withdrawal (Table
S1). Gray boxes indicate periods of imatinib treatment in both cases. Dashed line is drawn at
a WBC of 30K/μl; counts above the line indicate disease.
(D) H/P and Hip1 message levels were not elevated in bone marrow after imatinib therapy.
Mice were treated with vehicle (n=4) or twice daily imatinib (n=4) for 14 days. Bone
marrow was harvested from both femurs for H/P expression analysis (left). Wild type
murine Hip1 levels were tested to determine if imatinib led to general upregulation of the
Hip1 locus (right). Error bars represent standard deviation. There were no significant
differences between the two conditions (vehicle v. imatinib).

(A) Treatment protocol for mice with H/P;A/E-induced MPN. H/P;A/E diseased mice were
treated with imatinib for 14 days and subsequently injected with either the Cy/G mobilizing
agent for five days, or arsenic trioxide for 14 days. Both treatments were given in the
continuous presence of imatinib, as depicted. Treatments were stopped and relapse analysis
was performed 28 days later.
(B) WBC counts at disease onset, after imatinib treatment, or after imatinib and Cy/G

(C) WBC counts at disease onset, after imatinib treatment, or after imatinib with additional
daily arsenic trioxide injections for two weeks. Weeks 1-3 on the x-axis indicates time after
withdrawal of treatment. *p<0.05 as determined using Pearson Chi-square analysis.
(D) H/P;A/E induced MPN mice (n=28) were tested for the therapeutic effects of
supplemental arsenic. Mice were randomly assigned to imatinib or imatinib supplemented
with arsenic trioxide and observed over an eight week period and then sacrificed for
hematopoietic analysis. (*p< 0.05 as determined by the Mantel-Cox and Gehan-BreslowWilcoxon tests). Nine of the 12 (75%) imatinib plus arsenic treated mice were with normal
size livers and spleens vs. all of the imatinib treated mice relapsed with hepatosplenomegaly.

Figure 6. Models of MPN-initiating cell persistence

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Schematic of normal myeloid development with dark blue HSCs (cycling between quiescent
and activated states) differentiating into myeloid progenitors (light blue) which divide into
terminally differentiated mature myeloid cells (lightest blue). The persistence of an MPNinitiating cell (depicted as a dark orange) leads to hyper-production of myeloid progenitors
(light orange) and mature myeloid cells (lightest orange). Three possibilities are presented
for response to tyrosine kinase inhibition by imatinib.
Situation I assumes that myeloid progenitors with the oncogenic kinase are the only cells
sensitive to elimination by imatinib. In this scenario, MPN-initiating cells circumvent kinase
inhibition and continue to aberrantly differentiate and self-renew. However, the continued
presence of imatinib rapidly dispatches the overproduced myeloid progenitors, leaving
behind a relatively rare (but active) population of MPN-initiating cells.
Situation II shows that the MPN-initiating cells and mutant progenitors depend on
oncogenic kinase signaling for leukemogenesis, but not survival. In this scenario, kinase
inhibition by imatinib causes reversion to normal HSC differentiation. The end result is a
hematopoietic compartment with a mixed population of wild type and mutant cells that are
phenotypically similar.
Situation III indicates what is desired to achieve a cure where MPN-initiating cells are
converted to imatinib sensitivity as a result of additional drugs such as arsenic trioxide.

H/P;A/E diseased mice were treated for 14 days with imatinib prior to transplant of their bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice.
This was necessary because when the mice were not treated, the majority of diseased cells were terminally differentiated neutrophils that diluted
out any transplantable cells in the bone marrow. In fact, LT-HSCs are difficult to detect in diseased bone marrow. WBM or FACS isolated
populations were co-transplanted with 200,000 wild type bone marrow protective cells.

H/P;A/E diseased mice were either injected with the Cy/G, G-CSF (G), arsenic trioxide (ASO), or vehicle alone. All treatments occurred in the
continuous presence of imatinib as depicted schematically in Figure 3A. Twenty-nine days after imatinib therapy, bone marrow or spleen cells
were transplanted into lethally irradiated syngeneic recipient mice. Control bone marrow cells (500,000 cells) were included in each transplant for
radioprotection.
**

MPN-initiating cell frequency was diminished by G-CSF and ASO as determined by the inability of mice treated with these drugs and imatinib
to transfer disease from bone marrow or spleen into secondary recipients. See also Figure 3.
