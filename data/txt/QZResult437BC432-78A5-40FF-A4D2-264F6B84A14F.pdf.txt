and neck (1–3). Chronic hypoxia and/or anoxia can develop in
regions of solid tumors as a function of reduced O2 diffusion with
increasing distance from the vasculature. Acute hypoxia can arise
due to transient restrictions in blood flow known to occur within
the dynamic and tortuous tumor vasculature. Hypoxic tumor cells
can be locally and systemically aggressive with a decreased
sensitivity to apoptotic and other cell death signals, increased
angiogenesis, increased proliferation, and an increased capacity for
systemic metastasis (4–6). Experimental and spontaneous metastatic capacity can be increased when tumor cells are subjected to
hypoxia and can be secondary to genetic instability (6–8). Anoxic
cells can also be more chemoresistant and radioresistant than oxic
cells. The latter can be expressed as the oxygen enhancement ratio
(OER) that is defined as the ratio of doses required for the same
biological effect (e.g., survival) in the absence or presence of
oxygen. The OER for a wide range of cell lines and tissues is
between 2.5 and 3.3 (9).
Acute anoxia and reoxygenation can lead to phosphorylation of
the CHK2 and CHK1 kinases via the ataxia telangiectasia–mutated
(ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia Rad3–related (ATR) kinases that
enact G1, S, and G2 cell cycle checkpoints. These arrests can be
used to repair the DNA damage caused by stalled or collapsed
replication forks in S phase to reduce cell lethality (10–12), as
residual or misrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (dsb) can lead
to chromosomal deletion, translocations, and rearrangement and/
or mitotic catastrophe (13).
In human cells, DNA-dsbs are primarily repaired through two
different pathways: homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ; refs. 13, 14). HR is a template-guided,
error-free pathway, predominantly operating in the S and G2 phases
of the cell cycle as it requires a repair template from a sister
chromatid or chromosome. HR involves many proteins including
RAD51, the RAD51 paralog complexes RAD51C-XRCC3 and
RAD51B-C-D-XRCC2, and the p53, RPA, BRCA2, and BLM proteins
(13, 15). In contrast, NHEJ is predominant in the G1 and G2 phases
and is usually error prone (13, 16).
Inhibition of the DNA-dsb repair pathways has been linked to
increased genetic instability and carcinogenesis. For example,
DNA-PKcs–deficient mice exhibit increased telomeric fusions (17),
whereas overexpression of dominant-negative RAD51 is associated
with centrosome aberrations and increased tumorigenicity (18).
Cells expressing a dominant-negative form of RAD51 or hypomorphic alleles of BRCA2 show impaired HR (19), and cells deficient in

Abstract
Hypoxic and/or anoxic tumor cells can have increased rates
of mutagenesis and altered DNA repair protein expression.
Yet very little is known regarding the functional consequences of any hypoxia-induced changes in the expression
of proteins involved in DNA double-strand break repair. We
have developed a unique hypoxic model system using H1299
cells expressing an integrated direct repeat green fluorescent protein (DR-GFP) homologous recombination (HR)
reporter system to study HR under prolonged chronic
hypoxia (up to 72 h under 0.2% O2) without bias from
altered proliferation, cell cycle checkpoint activation, or
severe cell toxicity. We observed decreased expression of HR
proteins due to a novel mechanism involving decreased HR
protein synthesis. Error-free HR was suppressed 3-fold
under 0.2% O2 as measured by the DR-GFP reporter system.
This decrease in functional HR resulted in increased
sensitivity to the DNA cross-linking agents mitomycin C
and cisplatin but not to the microtubule-interfering agent,
paclitaxel. Chronically hypoxic H1299 cells that had
decreased functional HR were relatively radiosensitive
[oxygen enhancement ratio (OER), 1.37] when compared
with acutely hypoxic or anoxic cells (OER, 1.96–2.61). Using
CAPAN1 cells isogenic for BRCA2 and siRNA to RAD51, we
confirmed that the hypoxia-induced radiosensitivity was due
to decreased HR capacity. Persistent down-regulation of HR
function by the tumor microenvironment could result in
low-fidelity DNA repair and have significant implications for
response to therapy and genetic instability in human
cancers. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):605–14]

Materials and Methods

HR or NHEJ have a reduced capacity for DNA-dsb rejoining (20, 21).
Therefore, maintaining error-free repair is imperative to preserve
genomic stability (4).
Given that many human tumors contain hypoxic subpopulations, it is surprising that there are few data concerning DNA-dsb
repair under conditions of acute versus chronic hypoxia. DNA
repair in proliferating cells that have chronically adapted to low
O2 levels may be considerably different from cells that undergo
acute anoxia/reoxygenation cycles that activate the ATM and
ATR checkpoints. Therefore, numerous factors could alter overall
DNA repair and cell fate within tumor subpopulations: the
relative percentage of oxic or hypoxic or anoxic cells, the relative
duration of hypoxic exposure and cell transit times (e.g.,
proportion of acute to chronic hypoxia), and differential protein
function under a range of O2 levels (e.g., differential biology
between 0.0% and 5.0%; ref. 22). These factors need investigation
as nonrepaired DNA breaks, as a function of the microenvironment, could activate oncogenes or inactivate tumor suppressor
genes and drive a mutator phenotype and aggressive tumor cell
phenotypes (4).
Recent studies from our laboratories and others have reported
the effect of hypoxia on HR gene and protein expression (23–25).
Gene expression studies in prostate cells conducted by Meng
et al. (25) showed down-regulation of many HR mRNA species
after treatment with chronic hypoxia (e.g., 72 h  0.2% O2). The
expression of HR proteins was also decreased and was
independent of p53 status, hypoxia-induced apoptosis, or altered
cell cycle distribution. These studies supported earlier work in
which an HIF-1a–independent down-regulation of RAD51 was
also observed by Bindra et al. (23, 24) in a range of cancer cell
lines after treatment with 48 h  0.01% O2 and in prostate and
cervix cancer xenograft studies in vivo based on decreased RAD51
expression in areas that were avid for hypoxic biomarkers (i.e.,
EF5; ref. 24).
Several recent studies have investigated the potential mechanism(s) for hypoxia-mediated changes in protein expression. A
model of acute hypoxia-induced transcriptional repression has
been proposed by Bindra et al. (23, 26) who showed that the
hypoxic down-regulation of RAD51 and BRCA1 can be mediated
by altered E2F transcriptional activation and repression. In other
cell lines, the RNA and protein expression of HR genes is
discordant after chronic hypoxic exposure (25), suggesting an
additional level of genetic control. Indeed, a complementary
model of hypoxia-induced translational repression has been
proposed and could also explain decreased HR expression under
hypoxia (27–29). In these studies, overall mRNA translation is
severely, but reversibly, inhibited during hypoxia. The effect of
hypoxia on the synthesis of DNA-dsb repair proteins has not been
previously studied.
Despite the data above, hypoxia has not yet been directly linked
to an HR-deficient cellular phenotype [e.g., sensitivity to mitomycin
and other DNA cross-linking agents]. Herein, we report that
exposure to chronic hypoxia (under conditions in which cell cycle
checkpoints are not activated) induces down-regulation of the HR
DNA-dsb repair pathway with the consequence of increased
sensitivity to ionizing radiation and DNA cross-linking agents. We
also show that this HR protein down-regulation is mediated, in part,
by changes in the efficiency of HR mRNA translation. Our studies
suggest that chronically hypoxic cells may be repair-deficient and
may be a targetable pathway for novel chemoprevention and cancer
treatment strategies.

Cell culture. The H1299 human lung carcinoma cell line was grown in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 20 mmol/L HEPES. These cells
express a direct repeat green fluorescent protein (DR-GFP) reporter system
(19, 30). The CAPAN1 human pancreatic cancer cell lines (clones D2 and D2
B74) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% FCS, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, 4.5 g/L dextrose, and 1 mmol/L pyruvic acid. These cells are
isogenic for the expression and function of BRCA2 and are isogenic for
functional HR as previously described (31).
Hypoxic treatments, cell proliferation, and cell cycle assays. T75
flasks containing logarithmically growing cells were exposed to a
continuous flow of humidified 21% O2 (normoxia), 0.2% O2 (hypoxia), or
0% O2 (anoxia) with 5% CO2 and balanced N2, using a custom designed glass
manifold system based on a system described by Young et al. (32). An
OxyLite oxygen probe (Oxford Optronix) verified that target O2 levels were
achieved within 6 h of gassing. Measurements of glucose and pH over
periods of up to 72 h showed that these variables changed minimally under
hypoxic gassing conditions (e.g., glucose range, 7.5–11.4 mmol/L; pH range,
7.29–7.40).
Relative cell proliferation was determined by daily counts of cells at 24,
48, and 72 h during gas treatment, and the data were plotted after
normalizing against cell number at time 0. The cell cycle distribution of cells
grown under the varying O2 conditions was quantified using dual-variable
flow cytometry (33). Briefly, gas-treated cells were incubated with 10 Amol/L
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 30 min before collection without
reoxygenation. Cells were then washed with CaCl2/MgCl2-free PBS and
fixed in 70% ethanol. The DNA was denatured using 2 N HCl with 0.5%
Triton X-100 and neutralized with 0.1 mol/L Na2B4O7 (pH 8.5). Cells were
stained with anti-BrdUrd FITC (BD Bioscience) and propidium iodide and
analyzed using a FACSCalibre flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and
CellQuest software (BD Biosciences; ref. 33).
Western blot analysis and siRNA treatments. Protein expression was
determined by Western blot analysis (25). Whole cell lysates were
separated on 6% to 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate blocking buffer and primary/secondary antibodies. Imaging and
densitometry was carried out using an Odyssey IR Imaging System (LICOR Bioscience).
Primary antibodies included the following: HIF-1a (BD Transduction
Laboratories); ACTIN (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.); RAD51, BRCA1, and BRCA2
(Calbiochem); RAD51B, RAD51D, and RAD54 (Abcam, Inc.); and RAD51C,
XRCC3, and RAD50 (Novus Biologicals, Inc.).
RAD51 siRNA duplex 1 and 2 and the negative oligo were obtained from
Invitrogen and used at a concentration of 0.25 nmol/L for 24 h. Transfection
of siRNA or negative oligo was achieved using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen).
RNA isolation, reverse transcription PCR, and real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen).
Sample RNA or human reference RNA (Stratagene) was treated with
DNase I (Roche Diagnostics). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was
performed using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription kit (Applied
Biosystems).
Real-time PCR primers and fluorescent probes of target genes were
obtained as Assays-On-Demand from Applied Biosystems. The following
genes were assayed: 18S (endogenous control), VEGF, GRP94, BRCA2, MDC1,
RAD51, RAD51C, and RAD54. Each PCR reaction was done in triplicate on
an ABI real-time quantitative PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) under the
control of SDS software (Applied Biosystems). The fluorescence intensity
threshold was set at 0.2 and the reaction cycle-threshold was obtained.
Analysis was performed using the relative standard curve quantification
method.
Polysomal fractionation and analysis. Polysomal fractionation and
analysis were performed as described previously (29). Briefly, cell lysates
were layered on a 10 mL continuous sucrose gradient. After centrifugation,
the absorbance at 254 nm (derived primarily from rRNA) was measured
continuously as a function of gradient depth. After background subtractions,

Hypoxia Leads to Defective Homologous Recombination

conclude that gassing for periods up to 72 h  0.2% O2 allows for
the study of chronic hypoxia on DNA-dsb repair in H1299 cells
without bias from cell toxicity, decreased proliferation, or altered
cell cycle distribution.
Expression of DNA repair genes under chronic hypoxia.
Using a variety of cancer cell lines, we have previously shown that
RAD51 and other HR associated proteins can be differentially
expressed in malignant versus normal cells (39) and can be downregulated under hypoxia or anoxia. However, there is no general
concordance between the effect on mRNA and protein under low
O2 gassing conditions, suggesting a role for translation in addition
to transcription, in mediating low HR protein levels (24–26). In the
current study, we compared the effect of prolonged hypoxia on HR
gene transcription and mRNA translation in H1299 cells. Western
blotting confirmed that the expression of the HR repair proteins
RAD51, RAD51B/C, RAD54, and XRCC3 were all significantly downregulated in this model (Fig. 2A) in which cell cycle distribution is
unchanged (Fig. 1D). However, real-time PCR showed no significant
changes in the transcript levels of the HR genes in H1299 cells
(Fig. 2B).
To test the effect of hypoxia on the mRNA translation of HR
genes, polysomal fractionation analysis was performed to
determine the association of ribosomes with the mRNA of two
key HR proteins, RAD51 and BRCA2. In this assay, actively
translated mRNAs containing two or more ribosomes (polysomes) are separated from inefficiently translated mRNAs bound
to zero or one ribosome (monosome) by sedimentation through
a sucrose gradient. When recording the absorbance as a function
of gradient depth (Fig. 2B), the fractional polysome area under
the curve is a direct reflection of de novo protein synthesis.
Exposure to anoxic conditions resulted in a rapid and substantial
inhibition of mRNA translation that persisted for >72 h (Fig. 2C),
indicating that at this concentration, the translation of the
majority of gene transcripts is severely inhibited. Exposure of
0.2% O2 resulted in a considerably smaller, but significant,
decrease in overall translation efficiency. We also analyzed the
mRNA translation of specific HR genes by determining their
mRNA distribution within the polysome profiles. Under oxic
conditions, the majority of the RAD51 and BRCA2 mRNA contain
seven or more ribosomes, indicating highly efficient translation.
However, after 48 h at 0.2% O2, there is a severe drop in the
number of ribosomes per transcript, indicating reduced translation of RAD51 and BRCA2 in hypoxic proliferating cells (Fig. 2D).
This severe drop in translation efficiency of RAD51 and BRCA2
contrasts the modest inhibition of overall translation as well as a
control gene (ACTIN) under these conditions. These data
indicate that chronic hypoxia leads to a specific decrease in
the synthesis of HR repair proteins by a novel mechanism of
translational inhibition, even under conditions which cause only
modest changes in the overall rates of mRNA translation and
where cell proliferation is preserved.
HR is down-regulated by chronic hypoxia. The functional
consequences of the decreased HR protein translation were
determined using a stably integrated DR-GFP reporter construct
that measures the frequency of HR in the context of chromatinassociated DNA repair in H1299 cells (Fig. 3A). The reporter
construct contains a GFP gene, which is interrupted by a rare
restriction site (I-SceI), and a downstream GFP fragment. Cells
were transfected with a plasmid encoding for either a negative
control, GFP (transfection efficiency control), or the endonuclease

overall translation efficiency was estimated by calculating the fractional
area under the curve corresponding to two or more ribosomes (polysomes).
Data from three experiments were averaged and plotted with the SD of
the data.
The translation efficiency of individual genes (ACTIN, RAD51, and
BRCA2) was determined by assessing the distribution of the mRNA of the
genes throughout the polysome profile. Fractions from sucrose gradients
representing 2 to 3, 4 to 5, 6 to 7, and >7 polysomes were collected; mRNA
was isolated and levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The
relative amount of mRNA in each of these fractions was determined after
exposure to hypoxia.
HR assay. To evaluate HR repair of DNA-dsbs, H1299 cells containing
the DR-GFP construct were transfected with pGFP (transfection efficiency
control) or pCMV3xnlsI-SceI ( functional endonuclease) or phCMV-1 I-SceI
(negative control) under 21% or 0.2% O2 conditions. Transient expression
of I-SceI endonuclease generates a DNA-dsb at the integrated green
fluorescent protein (GFP) gene sequences and stimulates HR. GFP signal
was assayed at 3 days post-transfection on a FACSCalibre flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences). For each experiment, 50,000 cells were scored per
treatment group and the frequency of recombination events was
calculated from the number of GFP-positive cells divided by the number
of cells analyzed after correction for transfection efficiency. There were no
differences in transfection efficiency or GFP expression under oxia or
hypoxia (data not shown).
Clonogenic assays. Clonogenic assays were performed after gas and
drug/IR treatments as previously described (34). IR was used to induce
DNA-dsbs. Mitomycin and cisplatin were used to induce DNA interstrand
cross-links. Paclitaxel is a microtubule-interfering agent that does not
generally induce DNA damage as a mechanism for its toxicity. To determine
clonogenic survival after IR treatment, H1299 and CAPAN1 cells were
gassed for 6 h or 72 h and then exposed to 0 to 25 Gy IR using a 137Cs
irradiator (MDS Nordion) before, or after, reoxygenation. To determine
clonogenic survival after mitomycin or cisplatin treatment, H1299 cells were
gassed for 72 h and then reoxygenated and exposed to 1 h  1 Ag/mL
mitomycin or 24 h  0.5 Ag/mL cisplatin. To determine clonogenic survival
after paclitaxel treatment, cells were exposed to 0.01 Amol/L paclitaxel
while being gassed for 72 h  21% O2 or 0.2% O2.

Results
Chronic hypoxia, but not anoxia, preserves H1299 cell
proliferation and survival. Extremely low levels of oxygen
(anoxia) can result in apoptosis and DNA fragmentation and
decreased colony formation (35, 36). To study DNA-dsb repair
without these confounding variables, we developed a tissue culture
model using H1299 cells that would not be biased by cell toxicity,
decreased proliferation, or altered cell cycle distribution under low
O2 conditions.
We initially determined the specificity of our gassing system to
induce a differential phenotype when cells were gassed under
hypoxia or anoxia. Our gassing system equally induced the hypoxic
markers HIF-1a and VEGF under both 0.2% and 0% O2 (Fig. 1A).
However, the anoxia-specific marker GRP94 was significantly
induced only after anoxic gassing. The radiation clonogenic
survival curves of H1299 cells yielded an OER of 2.61 under 0%
O2 gassing and a lower OER of 2.19 under 0.2% O2 (Fig. 1B).
Exposure to a chronic anoxic treatment alone (72 h  0% O2)
resulted in a profound decrease in clonogenic survival, with a
reduction in survival of >97% (Fig. 1C). In contrast, chronic hypoxic
conditions (72 h  0.2% O2) only decreased survival on average by
18%. HR protein expression and function can be cell cycle specific
and biased by altered cell cycle distribution after hypoxic gassing
(37, 38). In our model, hypoxia (0.2% O2) did not decrease cell
proliferation or change the cell cycle distribution (Fig. 1D). We

hypoxia showed significantly increased sensitivity to both mitomycin (P = 0.05) and cisplatin (P = 0.006; Fig. 3B). As a control,
paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent that interferes with microtubules and does not cause DNA damage, had similar toxicity
under hypoxic and oxic conditions. We conclude that HR is
functionally down-regulated by chronic hypoxia. These results are
supported by down-regulation of RAD51 via siRNA, leading to
increased sensitivity to mitomycin as well as decreased HR as
measured by the DR-GFP assay (Fig. 3C).
Cellular radioresistance is decreased after chronic hypoxia.
Oxygen enhances the biological effects of radiation by interacting
with and ‘‘fixing’’ DNA damage after the indirect effect of IR in
the vicinity of DNA (9). Acute anoxia generally decreases IRinduced DNA-dsbs by 2- to 3-fold, reflecting the OER for this O2

to generate a specific DNA-dsb. In this assay, functional GFP can
only be restored if the DNA-dsb is repaired in an error-free manner
using the downstream GFP fragment as a template for HR (19). The
frequency of recombination as determined by flow cytometry was
significantly reduced by a factor of 3 (P = 0.017) after 72 h  0.2%
O2 gassing in proliferating cells (Fig. 3A).
To further test for a functional cellular defect in HR, cells were
exposed to hypoxia and then treated with mitomycin, cisplatin, or
paclitaxel. Mitomycin is a bioreductive alkylating agent that is
selectively toxic to HR-deficient cells by causing DNA interstrand
cross-links whose repair is HR dependent (40, 41). Cisplatin is a
commonly used platinum-based chemotherapeutic that also causes
interstrand crosslinks. In keeping with the observed effects of
hypoxia on the DR-GFP HR assay, cells pretreated with chronic

2-fold more radioresistant than oxic cells (OER, 1.96 F 0.27). In contrast, chronically hypoxic H1299 cells were only slightly more radioresistant than oxic cells

level. As expected, H1299 cells gassed with an acute hypoxic
treatment showed a 2-fold increase in radioresistance (OER, 1.96 F

(Fig. 1C). Cells treated with chronic hypoxia (72 h  0.2% O2) had

0.01). Knocking down RAD51 with siRNA to levels similar to the
levels seen under chronic hypoxia also sensitizes H1299 cells to
IR (Fig. 4B). We conclude that chronic hypoxic conditions, which

lead to an HR-deficiency, results in reduced hypoxic radioresistance.
To further prove that the effect on radiosensitivity was HR dependent, we determined the effect of chronic hypoxia on the hypoxic
radiosensitivity of paired CAPAN1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell
lines that are isogenic for BRCA2 (D2 and D2 B74; Fig. 4C). In
support of our H1299 gassing data, BRCA2-deficient cells show
no difference in radiosensitivity between cells treated with either
acute (OER, 1.56 F 0.02) or chronic hypoxia (OER, 1.55 F 0.02;
Fig. 4D). Complementing this cell line with functional BRCA2

increased the baseline radioresistance (OER, 1.76 F 0.07).
However, their hypoxia-mediated radioresistance was decreased
after chronic hypoxia in a manner similar to that observed for the
H1299 cell line (OER, 1.14 F 0.09). These data support our hypothesis that the inherent radioresistance of acutely hypoxic cells is
abrogated under chronic hypoxia and that this is dependent on
functional HR.

genes under conditions of hypoxia, which resulted in only a modest
reduction in the overall rate of cellular mRNA translation. A similar
treatment had little effect on the levels of NHEJ proteins (data not
shown), supporting specificity for the HR pathway under these
study conditions.
Translational control is increasingly recognized as a mechanism
for altering specific gene expression and is highly influenced by
sequences within the 5¶ and 3¶ untranslated regions. Under hypoxia,
this suppression is controlled through at least two distinct
pathways: first, by phosporylated extracellular signal-related
kinase–mediated phosphorylation of eIF2a, which is required for
the recruitment of aminoacylated tRNA and second, by disruption
of the mRNA cap–binding complex, eIF4F (47). Both pathways
result in the inhibition of mRNA translation but lead to important
differences in the translation of specific genes. Further studies
using cells with defined defects in each of these pathways will be
required to elucidate the exact mechanisms involved in translational control of HR protein expression under chronic hypoxia.
However, it seems that both altered transcription and translation
are important in determining decreased DNA repair protein
expression, and the relative contributions of each mechanism
may depend on cell type, oxygen concentration, and experimental
design.
The relative radioresistance acquired by anoxic cells, as
manifested in the OER, has recently been shown to be associated
with HR proficiency (48). Irradiation of Chinese hamster cell lines
with mutations in HR genes (e.g., XRCC2, XRCC3, BRCA2, and
RAD51C) under oxic (20% O2) and anoxic (<0.1% O2) conditions
revealed a decreased OER (1.5–2.0) when compared with the OER
for HR-proficient wild-type cells (2.6–3.0). No effect on OER was
noted for NHEJ-deficient cells. In support of this recent study,
we observed that the hypoxic radioresistance observed after
acute hypoxia (6 h  0.2% O2; OER, 1.96 F 0.27) in HR-proficient
cells was mostly lost after chronic hypoxia (72 h  0.2% O2; OER,
1.37 F 0.05). This is consistent with the effects on radiosensitivity
due to impairment of HR proficiency (21). This HR effect on
radiosensitivity may in part be due to an altered number and
repair of DNA-dsbs, DNA-single strand breaks, DNA-DNA interstrand cross-links, or DNA protein cross-links and requires
further study (48).
Our observations open up the possibility for novel therapeutic
strategies that target HR and chronic hypoxia. Fractionated
radiotherapy is a successful cancer treatment modality that maintains the therapeutic ratio (e.g., increased killing in tumor cells
relative to normal tissues) by differential cellular repair between
malignant and normal tissues (49). Traditionally, acutely hypoxic
cells have been documented as being extremely radioresistant
due to the biophysics of oxygen free radical attack and fixation
of DNA lesions. The process of reoxygenation during radiotherapy is thought to offset tumor radioresistance to improve the
likelihood of local control and may alter the proportion of
both acute and chronic hypoxia. Based on our data, we suggest
that the relative radiosensitivity of chronically hypoxic cells may
be an additional factor in determining radiotherapeutic local
control.
Novel molecular-based therapies could take advantage of DNA
repair deficiencies to selectively kill hypoxic cells that would
otherwise acquire a mutator phenotype. The therapeutic ratio
may be favored in this approach, given that few normal tissues
are hypoxic. Furthermore, malignant tissues may have decreased
repair capability and discordance between cell cycle checkpoint

Discussion
The experiments outlined in this paper were conducted under
conditions of chronic prolonged hypoxia that prevented alterations
in cell cycle distribution or anoxia-induced cell cycle checkpoints:
all factors that could potentially bias HR expression and function.
This is the first report of chronic hypoxia-induced suppression of
HR DNA-dsb repair proteins at the translational level leading to
functional impairment of the HR pathway. Furthermore, we report
for the first time that hypoxia-mediated inhibition of HR gene
expression results in a functional HR impairment with increased
sensitivity to IR, mitomycin, and cisplatin and confirming an HRdeficient phenotype.
Many studies have assessed the expression and function of DNA
repair genes solely under anoxic (0% O2) rather than hypoxic
conditions (11). Anoxia can induce an ATM- and ATR-mediated G1
and intra-S (DNA replicative) arrest and a further G2 phase arrest
upon reoxygenation (42–44). This could lead to altered S and G2
fractions that may bias HR protein expression and function, given
that HR is cell cycle dependent (37). However, our data support a
cell cycle–independent decrease in HR function. Although HR
might require to restart collapsed replication forks in S phase, the
residual HR capacity after 0.2% gassing may just be sufficient to
allow normal cellular proliferation.
In this report, we studied the biology of chronic and
prolonged hypoxia, which can reflect longer cell transit times
across intratumoral oxygen partial pressure gradients in certain
slowly growing tumors (e.g., prostate and other cancers). This
biology may be very different than conditions of cyclic acute
anoxia that can produce reactive oxygen species during
subsequent reoxygenation. Indeed, the effects on HR protein
expression and function are not observed until at least 24 h of
hypoxic gassing (25). Therefore, prolonged hypoxic conditions in
adapted tumor cells with decreased DNA repair and absent
checkpoint control could lead to the accumulation of DNA
damage, genetic instability, and mutator and/or resistant
phenotypes (45). Studies using innovative models that allow
for long-term hypoxic incubation (e.g., 3–4 weeks) with
subsequent characterization of cell phenotype and genotype will
be required to directly test this hypothesis.
Hypoxia can alter the balance of activating and repressive E2F
transcription factors, thereby affecting the expression of BRCA1
and RAD51 protein in a HIF-1a–independent manner (23, 26).
However, in our H1299 model, the mRNA levels of the HR repair
genes was unaffected after 72 h  0.2% O2. This suggested an
additional mode of regulation of HR proteins under hypoxia.
Polysomal fractionation analysis of RAD51 and BRCA2 transcripts
revealed that in H1299 cells, the expression of these genes is
regulated at the translational level. Regulation of mRNA translation
can dramatically alter individual gene expression and possibly also
explain reduced HR protein levels under chronic hypoxic
conditions (46). Importantly, this effect was specific to HR repair

control and DNA repair, which could make them more
susceptible to CHK2-CHK1 targeting and agents that sensitize
one repair pathway over another (49). This concept could also
include the use of chemotherapeutic agents such as etoposide, or
PARP inhibitors, that can preferentially sensitize HR-deficient
cells (11, 13).
A prerequisite for the use of novel therapies based on these
preclinical studies is the ability to predict the fraction of acute and
chronic hypoxic cells in solid tumors and their relative oxygen
concentration. One strategy could involve using a serial injection of
two different hypoxic markers, such as pimonidazole and EF5, in
combination with markers of proliferation (e.g., BuDr and IuDr)
and blood vessels as described by Ljungkvist et al. (50). Intratumoral regions that are matched for the two hypoxic markers are
chronically hypoxic, and those mismatched for staining are acutely
hypoxic. Such studies are under way in our laboratory, whereby the
relative repair of DNA-dsbs can be tracked as a function of acute
and chronic hypoxia and correlated to tumor radioresponse and
