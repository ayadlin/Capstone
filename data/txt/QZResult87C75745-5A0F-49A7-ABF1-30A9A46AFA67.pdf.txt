Abstract
Patupilone is an epothilone in advanced clinical development
that has shown promising efficacy in heavily pretreated
patients. This study aimed at characterizing the mechanisms
of patupilone activity in resistant patients. To this end, we
generated patupilone-resistant cells using two cellular models,
the first characterized by high chemosensitivity and low class
III B-tubulin (TUBB3) expression (A2780), and the second by
low chemosensitivity and high TUBB3 expression (OVCAR-3).
The obtained cell lines were named EPO3 and OVCAR-EPO,
respectively. The same selection procedure was done in A2780
cells to generate a paclitaxel-resistant cell line (TAX50).
Factors of resistance are expected to increase in the drugresistant cell lines, whereas factors of drug sensitivity will be
down-regulated. Using this approach, we found up-regulation
of TUBB3 in TAX50, but not EPO3, cells, showing that TUBB3
mediates the resistance to paclitaxel but not to patupilone.
Moreover, TUBB3 was a factor of patupilone sensitivity
because OVCAR-EPO cells exhibited a dramatic reduction of
TUBB3 and a concomitant sensitization to hypoxia and
cisplatin-based chemotherapy. To identify the mechanisms
underlying patupilone resistance, tubulin genes were sequenced, thereby revealing that a prominent mechanism
of drug resistance is represented by point mutations in class
I B-tubulin. Overall, these results suggest that paclitaxel and
patupilone have nonoverlapping mechanisms of resistance,
thus allowing the use of patupilone for those patients
relapsing after paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. Furthermore,
patupilone represents a promising first-line option for the
treatment of high-risk ovarian cancer patients, who exhibit
high TUBB3 levels and poor response to standard paclitaxelplatin chemotherapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(24):10197–204]

Introduction
Microtubule-targeting agents are widely used for cancer
treatment. Microtubule-targeting agents are classically divided
into drugs acting as inhibitors and those as enhancers of tubulin
polymerization, although it is likely that at the low drug
concentrations obtainable in patients, both groups act through
inhibition of microtubule dynamics (1). The taxanes paclitaxel and
docetaxel are widely used in treatments of solid tumors. They are

two natural compounds that enhance tubulin polymerization and
share the same framework (10-deacetylbaccatin III, obtained from
Taxus spp. throughout the world) and are approved for clinical use
in ovary, lung, breast, head and neck, gastric, and prostate cancers.
Whereas an acceptable response rate is obtained in some patients,
which has led to their clinical approval, the major problem in their
clinical use is drug resistance. Unfortunately, often remission lasts
only a few months or even weeks, and on relapse, patients do not
respond further. Efforts to develop novel taxanes with an improved
activity profile in resistant patients have not been successful (2).
One reason for this failure is that the clinical development of novel
taxanes has been hampered by poor knowledge of the drug
resistance mechanisms in resistant patients. In fact, the development of novel taxanes has been mainly guided by selecting lead
compounds for the activity against P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the gene
product of the ABCB1 (MDR) gene. This has resulted in the clinical
development of a series of taxanes able to potently inhibit the P-gp
function, but their response rates in phase II clinical studies were
disappointingly lower than expected, showing that this resistance
mechanism, which is easily observable in cultured cell lines (3),
does not actually operate in patients with solid tumors (2).
Screening for additional compounds directed against P-gp–
expressing cells revealed another class of natural compounds, the
epothilones (4), which are produced by the myxobacterium
Sorangium cellulosum and partially share the same pharmacophore
of taxanes (5). However, in contrast to P-gp–targeting taxanes,
epothilones remain effective when used in resistant patients,
suggesting that the clinical activity depends on factors other than
P-gp. For this reason, the first epothilone (Ixabepilone) has been
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
treating aggressive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer
that is no longer responsive to currently available chemotherapies
(6). Patupilone (epothilone B, EPO906) is another epothilone in
advanced phase III clinical development. Preclinical data have
confirmed that it also retains activity in patients relapsing from or
resistant to a taxane-containing chemotherapy (7). This study
aimed to identify the molecular basis for patupilone activity in
resistant cells. The results show that the mechanisms underlying
patupilone resistance are significantly different from those
responsible for taxane resistance, thereby providing a molecular
basis for identifying the subset of patients who are potentially
responsive to this novel therapy and the background to a
sequential combination of the two drugs in distinct clinical subsets.

Materials and Methods
Drugs. Paclitaxel was kindly provided by Indena, and patupilone by
Novartis. Drugs were diluted in absolute DMSO. These solutions was further
diluted at each experimental day to achieve a 0.1% final DMSO
concentration. All the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma if not
otherwise specified.

Cell cultures. A2780 and OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cells were
purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). TAX50,
PTX, and TC1 cells are A2780 cells resistant to paclitaxel and are described
elsewhere (8, 9). Culture media were selected according to ECACC
suggestions. Patupilone-resistant cells were obtained through stepwise
increase of drug concentration. The obtained patupilone-resistant cell lines
do not depend on drug presence for growth. For normoxia, cultures were
incubated at 37jC in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. For
hypoxia, experiments were done using a special chamber (BillupsRotenberg, Inc.) filled with 100% nitrogen. After removal of the supernatant,
live attached cells were counted blindly by two independent observers using
a Bürker cell.
Growth experiments with cytotoxic agents. Cells were seeded in black
96-well flat-bottomed plates (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). After 24 h, media
were replaced and, after one washing, media containing the drugs were
added. A dose-response logarithmic curve was established in quadruplicates
for each plate, starting from 0.1 to 10,000 nmol/L. Each experiment was
done thrice. After 72 h of culture in the presence of the tested compounds,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

plates were harvested and the number of viable cells was estimated using
the ATPlite kit (Perkin-Elmer Life Science) and the automated luminometer
Topcount (Perkin-Elmer Life Science). The kit was used according to the
manufacturer’s suggestions. For each drug/cell line, a dose-response curve
was plotted and the half maximal inhibiting concentration (IC50) values
were then calculated by fitting the dose-effect curve data obtained in the
three independent experiments with the sigmoid-Emax model using
nonlinear regression, weighted by the reciprocal of the square of the
predicted effect.
Real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was obtained from cultured
cells using RNeasy plus kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
directions. cDNA was prepared starting from 1 Ag of total RNA using the
iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Amplifications were carried out using specific primers and the
iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a final volume of 25 AL, starting with
a 3-min template denaturation step at 95jC followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at
95jC and 1 min at 60jC. Standard curves were generated using a serial
dilution of the initial amount of control cDNA to determine the range of
template concentrations, which showed a good linearity and efficiency for
the different reactions. Melt curves of the reaction products were also
generated to assess the specificity of the measured fluorescence. Samples
were run in triplicate and the mean of threshold cycles (Ct) for each
specimen was used to obtain the fold change of gene expression level using
the following equation: Fold change = 2 (Ct), where Ct = Ct specific gene
Ct GAPDH, and (Ct) = Ct specimen
Ct control (i.e., A2780). A fold
change equal to 1 represents a sample with an expression level equal to the
control cell line. This operation was done using the Excel spreadsheet
RelQuant (Bio-Rad).
Western blot analysis. Total cellular proteins were obtained lysing the
cells with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L sodium chloride, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate] in the presence of proteases and phosphatases inhibitors.
Protein concentration was determined by spectrophotometer and
proteins were run on SDS denaturing gels. Each protein sample
(50 Ag) was separated on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel and
electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Co.).
After electroblotting, the membranes were incubated in 5% nonfat dry
milk in 1 TBS/Tween 20 (0.1 mol/L Trizma base, 0.15 mol/L NaCl,
0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) for blocking and then with the following
antibodies: anti–class III h-tubulin polyclonal antibody (Covance), antiatubulin monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem), and anti–h-actin monoclonal
antibody (Sigma). After incubation with secondary horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad), visualization was done with the
enhanced chemiluminescence plus system (Amersham Biosciences) using
a Versadoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). For the assessment of the specific
h-tubulin isotypes, we have used and validated a panel of polyclonal anti–
h-tubulin isotypes, which were in-house generated with the following
specific reactivity: anti–class I (TUBB), anti–class II (TUBB2A and
TUBB2B), and anti–class V (TUBB6); all the antibodies were validated
with a protocol adapted from Hiser and colleagues (10), and the validation
dot blot is reported in Supplementary Fig. S1. The antibody anti–class IV
was purchased from Genetex.
Genomic DNA isolation and bisulfite treatment of DNA. The
methods for the assessment of the methylation status of the 3¶ flanking
region of TUBB3 human gene have been previously reported (11). Briefly,
genomic DNA was isolated from cell lines using Wizard Genomic
purification kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. To
distinguish methylated CpG from unmethylated CpG in hypoxia-inducible
factor-1a (HIF-1a) binding site of human TUBB3 3¶ flanking region, 1 Ag
of DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite using CpGenome DNA
modification kit (Serologicals Corp.). After this treatment, unmethylated
cytosine is converted to uracil, whereas methylated cytosine remains
unmodified.
Amplification, cloning, and sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA.
PCR primers to amplify the TUBB3 3¶-untranslated region were 5¶-ggttttgttttttttatttaggttatg-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-aatatctaacaacaataaatttattaaatatccc-3¶
(reverse). The PCR product was cloned into the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen)

Results
B-Tubulin isotypes and patupilone resistance. Drug resistance to microtubule-targeting agents is often associated to TUBB3

up-regulation (12, 13). To assess if TUBB3 is a factor of drug
resistance for patupilone, we exposed A2780 cells to patupilone and
paclitaxel (as a positive control). A2780 cells were chosen for their
chemosensitivity profile and low levels of TUBB3. Quantitative PCR
was used to measure the TUBB3 level at each step increase in drug
concentration. The levels of TUBB3 increased 5-fold in cells grown

in the presence of 50 nmol/L paclitaxel (TAX50), but this was not
detected in A2780 cells selected with patupilone, hereafter referred
to as EPO3x cells, where x corresponds to the patupilone dose used
for the selection. Data are shown in Fig. 1A, and the main features of
the obtained cell lines are reported in Table 1. Indeed, during the
selection with patupilone, the expression of TUBB3 actually
diminished, which suggests that TUBB3 affects the resistance to
paclitaxel but not to patupilone. To further determine the
correlation between patupilone resistance and TUBB3, we repeated
the same protocol in OVCAR-3 cells. This cell line was chosen for its
native drug resistance (with respect to A2780 cells) and high
expression levels of TUBB3. The cell lines obtained with this
selection procedure are named here as OVCAR-EPOx, where x again
corresponds to the patupilone dose used for the selection (Table 1).
Also in this case, quantitative PCR was used to monitor TUBB3
during the selection process. The results showed (Fig. 1A) that,

beginning from the first selection step with patupilone (2.5 nmol/L),
TUBB3 levels markedly decreased (by up to 30-fold), suggesting
that cells with elevated levels of TUBB3 are more sensitive to
patupilone. Due to the importance of this finding, the selection
step was independently repeated four times up to a patupilone dose
of 5 nmol/L, to elucidate anecdotal variations in the TUBB3
content. Again, we found consistent changes in the TUBB3
content, with a down-regulation similar to that evident in Fig. 1A
(data not shown).
The above phenomenon was analyzed at the protein level by
measuring TUBB3 expression with Western blotting in patupiloneresistant cell lines obtained at the highest drug doses (7.5 and
10 nmol/L for EPO3 and OVCAR-EPO cells, respectively) and in
A2780 cells made stably resistant to paclitaxel (PTX and TC1). Also
at the protein level, no increase in TUBB3 was evident in EPO3-7.5
cells, whereas, compared with the parental cell line, TUBB3 was
dramatically reduced in OVCAR-EPO10 cells (Fig. 1B).
To assess if changes in TUBB3 were associated with the
additional modulation of other h-tubulin isotypes, class I (TUBB),
class II (TUBB2A and TUBB2B), class IV (TUBB4 and TUBB2C),
and class V (TUBB6) were assessed by quantitative PCR and
Western blotting (Fig. 2). Class VI (TUBB1) was not assessed
because it is not detectable in ovarian cancer cells. The panel of
used antibodies is validated in Supplementary data. Comparing
quantitative PCR results and Western blots revealed only a
decrease in TUBB6 in OVCAR-EPO10 cells at the mRNA and
protein levels, suggesting that the decreases in TUBB3 and TUBB6
are correlated in the OVCAR-3 system.
Efflux pumps and patupilone resistance. Because patupilone
is reportedly active in cells expressing efflux pumps belonging to the
ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily (7), quantitative PCR was
also used to measure the expressions of ABCB1 (P-gp), ABCC1 (MRP),
and ABCG2 (BCRP) in EPO3-7.5 cells; OVCAR-EPO10 cells; and their
parental counterparts (Fig. 3). Rather than an overexpression, we
found that the ABCC1 and ABCG2 levels were consistently downregulated in the resistant cell lines, showing that these proteins do not
contribute to patupilone resistance. On the other hand, the ABCB1
gene was up-regulated (12-fold) in EPO3-7.5 cells, reaching the
expression level measured in parental OVCAR-3 cells. However, in
OVCAR-EPO cells expression of ABCB1 was consistently downregulated, suggesting that the fluctuations in the level of ABCB1
mRNA in EPO-3 cells are anecdotal and not related to the process of
patupilone resistance. In keeping with this interpretation, when the
analysis was repeated in Western blotting (Fig. 3A), the ABCB1
protein was below the detection threshold in all cell lines except
for TAX50 (the cell line exposed stepwise to up to 50 nmol/L
paclitaxel). These findings suggest that efflux pumps belonging to
the ABC superfamily do not contribute to patupilone resistance
because they are not detectably up-regulated in resistant cells at the
protein level.
Tubulin point mutations in patupilone-resistant cells.
Previous reports have associated drug resistance to microtubuletargeting agents with mutations in a-tubulin and h-tubulin genes
(14, 15). This issue was investigated by sequencing TUBB and
TUBB3 as well as the most-expressed a-tubulin genes in
patupilone-resistant cells and their parental counterparts. A
heterozygous mutation was found at position 298 in EPO3-7.5
cells (N298[N,S]), whereas the homozygous R282Q mutation was
evident in OVCAR-EPO10 cells (Fig. 4A). No mutations were
detectable in TUBB3, whereas two silent polymorphisms were
found in each of TUBA1A and TUBA1B. A heterozygous

Patupilone and Drug Resistance

polymorphism at position 45 in TUBA1C (G45[G,E]) was detected
in all the cell lines. To correlate the presence of point mutations
with the microtubule polymerization activity, patupilone-resistant
cells and their parental counterparts were treated for 30 minutes
with 5 and 10 nmol/L patupilone, and Western blotting was used to
assess the amount of polymerized and soluble tubulin after
ultracentrifuging the samples (Fig. 4B and C). The polymerization
did not differ between EPO3-7.5 and A2780 cells for 5 nmol/L
patupilone, but was slightly lower in EPO3-7.5 cells for 10 nmol/L
patupilone. It is evident that the R282Q mutation in OVCAR-EPO10
cells strongly affects drug-induced tubulin polymerization because
polymerization was lower with both 5 and 10 nmol/L patupilone.
However, we cannot exclude that other microtubule-associated
factors different from the R282Q mutation could be involved in the
reduced patupilone-driven tubulin polymerization observed in
OVCAR-EPO cell lines.
Patupilone resistance and sensitivity to hypoxia and
chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown that hypoxia is
able to induce the expression of TUBB3, and that this enhanced
expression is associated with methylation of a specific enhancer
positioned in the 3¶ flanking region of the human TUBB3 gene
(11). Interestingly, once methylated, this enhancer makes the
expression of TUBB3 constitutive and not further inducible by
hypoxia (11). Therefore, we investigated the effects of 24, 48, and
72 hours of hypoxia in patupilone-resistant cells and their
parental counterparts (Fig. 5A). The sensitivity to hypoxia did not
differ between A2780 and EPO3-7.5 cells. OVCAR-3 cells,
exhibiting high levels of TUBB3, were more resistant to hypoxia,
but this was inhibited in OVCAR-EPO10 cells. TUBB3 expression
was also monitored in these cell lines during hypoxia. Exposure
to hypoxia for 48 hours increased the levels of TUBB3 in OVCAREPO10 cells but not in parental OVCAR-3 cells (Fig. 5B). This
prompted us to investigate if the decrease in TUBB3 expression
and the restoration of TUBB3 inducibility by hypoxia were linked
to a modulation in the methylation of the enhancer at the 3¶
flanking region of the TUBB3 human gene. The methylation
status of this enhancer was assessed in the four cell lines
(Fig. 5C). The methylation did not differ between A2780 and
EPO3-7.5 cells, whereas in OVCAR-EPO10 cells there was a
dramatic reduction in the number of cells with a methylated
enhancer, thereby explaining the mechanism underlying the
reduced basal levels of the protein as well as TUBB3 induction in
hypoxia. These findings also prompted us to assess if these cells
are more sensitive to conventional chemotherapy (Fig. 5D). In
fact, cisplatin is the most effective treatment for ovarian cancer,
and increased TUBB3 expression has also been associated with
resistance to DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin (16). In
support to this interpretation, in OVCAR-EPO7.5 and OVCAREPO10 the reduction of TUBB3 was paralleled to a chemosensitization to cisplatin. Moreover, patupilone resistance was
not linked to paclitaxel resistance because the sensitivity to
paclitaxel was slightly enhanced in OVCAR-EPO7.5 and did not
change in OVCAR-EPO10. These findings point out that the
combination cisplatin/carboplatin with patupilone could be
promising in patients expressing high-levels of TUBB3 and prone
to drug resistance.

Discussion
Improving therapies for drug-resistant patients requires characterization of the mechanism(s) underlying chemotherapy failures.

Although drug resistance is a multifactorial process, the mechanisms that have already been validated in clinical studies are
attractive as targets for novel therapies aimed at high-risk patients.
Among these factors, a prominent role has been assumed by the
ectopic expression of TUBB3, as reviewed recently (12). Under
normal conditions, this protein is expressed at low levels in many
epithelia, such as the ovary and lung. However, under stress
conditions characterized by a low nutrient supply and oxygen
level, TUBB3 is transcriptionally induced through engagement
of HIF-1a binding at the 3¶ flanking region of the gene (11).

Once adapted to hypoxia, the enhancer at the 3¶ flanking region of
the gene is methylated and TUBB3 is no longer inducible,
remaining constitutively expressed (11). Cells with high levels of
TUBB3 are more resistant to hypoxia and chemotherapy.
Characterization of TUBB3 function suggests that this protein is
not only a marker but also a mediator of cell survival under stress
conditions (17).
Therefore, similar to other targets of HIF-1a (18), in tumors that
have progressed in a compelling hypoxic microenvironment, strong
TUBB3 expression after the first surgery will be the hallmark
of aggressive behavior and will increase the risk of resistance

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

to conventional chemotherapy (12, 19). For this reason, high
expression levels of TUBB3, as evident in around 20% of ovarian
cancer patients, are associated with an unfavorable outcome
even when treated, having a mean survival of 24 months (20),
which is close to that reported in patients treated only with
palliative cares without chemotherapy (21). In other words, the
current therapies do not have any significant effect on the clinical
course in these patients. Similar trends have been reported in lung
(22), breast (23), pancreas (24), and stomach (25) cancers, thereby
implicating TUBB3 in drug resistance in several types of solid
tumors.

Patupilone and Drug Resistance

The results here obtained with patupilone provide new hope for
these patients with an unfavorable prognosis. Our method was
based on the generation of drug-resistant cells in which the
antitumor effects of patupilone are inhibited through overexpression and down-regulation of those genes acting as factors of
resistance and sensitivity, respectively. We adopted two cellular
models, characterized by low and high TUBB3 expression, as well
as low and high sensitivity to hypoxia and chemotherapy. This
approach revealed that TUBB3 does not affect resistance to
patupilone because A2780 cells with a low TUBB3 expression and
high sensitivities to hypoxia and chemotherapy do not overexpress
this protein during the development of resistance. This behavior is
different from that seen with paclitaxel, whose resistance is easily
achieved through TUBB3 overexpression. More importantly, TUBB3
expression is indicative of sensitivity to this drug because OVCAREPO cells from the first step of drug selection exhibited a dramatic
reduction of TUBB3. This phenomenon cannot be ascribed to a
random clonal selection with the drug because we repeated the
selection with patupilone four times in OVCAR-3 cells and always
found a consistent down-regulation of TUBB3 expression. This
phenotypic conversion is associated with sensitization to hypoxia
and cisplatin. OVCAR-3 cells, which exhibit high constitutive
(not inducible) TUBB3 expression and resistance to hypoxia
(and cisplatin), acquire a phenotype very similar to that of drugsensitive A2780 cells. Moreover, the enhancer at the 3¶ flanking
region of the gene becomes demethylated, and on hypoxia, the
protein is inducible. Along with this effect in hypoxia, patupiloneresistant cells exhibited mild hypersensitivity to cisplatin, making
the combination of patupilone with cisplatin or carboplatin
particularly attractive.
In contrast to observations in paclitaxel, whose resistant
phenotype as described above is frequently associated with TUBB3
overexpression (8), tubulin point mutation occurs in cell lines made
resistant to patupilone. Such mutations have been extensively found
with epothilones in previous studies, including also the R282Q
mutation (14), which is mapped directly in the drug binding
site (26). No clinical studies have elucidated the frequency of
point mutations in patients treated with epothilones. On the other
hand, this resistance mechanism is not detectable in patients
treated with paclitaxel (27–29). It therefore seems that with
replacement of the TUBB3-driven resistance mainly occurring in
paclitaxel-resistant cells (and patients), patupilone therapy fails, at
least in part, through point mutations in the drug binding pocket,
thereby inducing a diminished susceptibility to drug-induced
microtubule polymerization. The nonoverlapping mechanism of
drug resistance opens the prospect of the sequential use of
patupilone in patients relapsing from taxane-including chemotherapy and could explain the good response rate that patupilone has
achieved in clinical trials.

Many studies have focused on P-gp as a central mediator of
multidrug resistance. Cytotoxic taxanes, which also act as potent
P-gp inhibitors, have not achieved the desired outcomes in phase II
clinical studies (2). Clinical trials have also shown that combining
P-gp inhibitors with chemotherapy does not have the desired effect
in the treatment of solid tumors (30). These unfavorable results
indirectly show that the P-gp role in drug resistance is marginal at
the bedside. This is supported by our previous experience of
finding no correlation between P-gp staining and drug resistance in
ovarian cancer patients (29). The clinical efficacy of patupilone was
originally mainly assigned to its activity against P-gp–expressing
cells (4). As the main change to this viewpoint, in the present study
we have identified patupilone as a targeted chemotherapeutic drug
that has the ability to specifically kill TUBB3-expressing cells. This
is supported by the dramatic reduction evident in OVCAR-EPO
cells and by the reappearance of cells in which TUBB3 is newly
inducible by hypoxia. In a modeling study, Magnani and colleagues
(26) predicted that TUBB3 would be targeted more specifically by
patupilone than by paclitaxel. Therefore, this study is in line with
this model.
In conclusion, this study shows that patupilone is endowed with
unique biological properties that do not overlap those of traditional
taxanes. Although originally selected for activity against P-gp–
expressing cells, this is not the mechanism underlying the drug
activity found in heavily pretreated patients. Moreover, our findings
could initiate a novel phase of preclinical development of these
agents. Several epothilones have been synthesized, but promising
leads were selected for their activity against P-gp–positive cells, and
hence it is possible that compounds with intrinsic minor toxicity
and better TUBB3 targeting have been discarded in favor of high
activity in P-gp–expressing cellular systems. Now that the present
study has identified TUBB3 as a main target of patupilone, a better
approach might be to look again at these compounds to obtain a
less toxic lead that might be more easily combinable with other
agents. Combining patupilone with cisplatin or carboplatin represents a promising advance for the treatment of high-risk patients
characterized by high TUBB3 expression levels, who are at a high risk
of rapid progression during standard conventional chemotherapy.
