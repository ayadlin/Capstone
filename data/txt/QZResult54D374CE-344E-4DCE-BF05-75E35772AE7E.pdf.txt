BACKGROUND. It is suspected that estrogen depletion resulting from treatment
may contribute to cognitive compromise in patients with breast cancer. However,
the evidence for estrogen effects on cognition is inconclusive, and the consequences of hormonal changes for cognitive function in patients with cancer
rarely have been investigated. In this study, the authors investigated the effects of
treatment-induced menopause and antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) on cognitive function.

METHODS. Cognitive performance was assessed in 101 patients with breast cancer
before the start of cancer therapy (T1), toward the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (T2), and 1 year after baseline (T3) using 12 cognitive tests. Menopause
occurred in a subgroup of patients, and an overlapping subgroup started antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen or AIs. Linear mixed-effects models that made it
possible to determine effects at group levels and individual levels simultaneously
were used for statistical analysis.

RESULTS. At the group level, a significant favorable effect of induced menopause
emerged in a test of executive function (P 5 .0035). Two additional group-level
effects of induced menopause, both favorable, and 2 individual-level effects that
were positive in some patients and negative in others were not significant when
multiple testing was taken into account. No significant effects of tamoxifen or
AIs on cognitive function were observed.

CONCLUSIONS. Hormonal changes did not appear to contribute to cognitive compromise in patients with breast cancer during the first year after diagnosis. Antiestrogen treatment with tamoxifen or AIs did not affect cognition, and the effects

treated with cytostatic agents.1-10 Cognitive dysfunction in cancer patients consequently has been attributed almost unanimously to chemotherapy.11 However,
many issues associated with the concept are unresolved,12 and some recent observations are inconsistent with this conclusion. The largest prospective trial
conducted to date did not identify any detrimental
effects of chemotherapy on the course of cognitive
function.13 In addition, cognitive compromise has
been demonstrated in cancer patients even before
they receive cytostatic treatment.14-16 These findings,
along with an increasing awareness of methodological
problems11,17,18 that limit the validity of much of the
evidence, have led to a broader view of the causation
of cognitive dysfunction in cancer patients. Multiple
causes may contribute to the condition colloquially
dubbed ‘chemobrain.’12,19 One of the factors suspected to affect breast cancer patients’ cognitive functioning is treatment-induced hormonal changes.
To date, the role of estrogen in cognitive functioning still is not understood well. Most laboratory
studies using animal models have indicated beneficial effects of estrogen on memory and learning,20,21
and plausible biologic explanations for these effects
have been suggested.22,23 However, results of studies
in humans are inconsistent. The population-based
Rotterdam study tested the relation between physiologic estrogen levels and the risk of dementia in
more than 1000 subjects aged 55 years. In women,
higher levels of estradiol were associated with an elevated risk of dementia.24 Many studies have tested
the effects of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT)
on cognition. The Women’s Health Initiative Memory
Study (WHIMS) reported an increased incidence of
dementia and more cognitive decline25-27 in women
who were assigned randomly to receive HRT compared with women who were assigned to receive placebo. Before the WHIMS, beneficial effects of HRT on
several cognitive domains and a reduction in the risk
of dementia had been reported, as well as no effects
of HRT on cognitive function.22,28,29
Very little is known about the effects of treatment-associated hormonal changes on cognitive
function in patients with breast cancer. In the majority of premenopausal breast cancer patients, abrupt
menopause is induced either by chemotherapy or by
treatment with gonadotropin-releasing–hormone
(GnRH) agonists. In most patients who are rendered
postmenopausal in this way, and in the majority of
naturally postmenopausal breast cancer patients, further estrogen depletion is achieved with antiestrogen
agents, mainly tamoxifen or AIs.
To our knowledge, only 1 study has assessed the
effects of treatment-induced menopause on cognitive

function. In a prospective trial that investigated the
course of cognitive function in breast cancer
patients, Jenkins et al13 observed an increased risk of
cognitive decline in patients who underwent treatment-induced menopause compared with patients
who already had been postmenopausal at the start of
therapy (P 5 .086).
Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has estrogen-antagonistic effects on
some tissues and estrogen-agonistic effects on
others. In studies that used neuroimaging, both
estrogen-like positive effects on the brain30 and negative effects opposed to those of estrogen31 have
been detected. Paganini-Hill and Clark mailed cognitive tests to a large group of breast cancer survivors.
Current users of tamoxifen had significantly poorer
scores than past users and never-users in 1 of 3 tests
(P 5 0.03), and there were no differences between
never-users and past users.32 Several studies that
assessed the effects of chemotherapy on cognitive
function also determined the effects of tamoxifen,
identifying either no effects4,6 or adverse effects.3,7,33
The evidence regarding the effects of AIs on cognition is sparse.34 In a pilot study, patients with breast
cancer who received either tamoxifen, or AIs (anastrozole), or both had poorer test results than healthy control individuals.35 In another study, patients who
received AIs (anastrozole; n 5 15) were compared with
patients who received tamoxifen (n 5 16). Significantly
poorer performance in learning and memory measures
was reported in those who received anastrozole.36
The current report is based on the multicenter
Cognitive Impairment in Therapy of Breast Cancer
study, which was designed to assess the effects of
chemotherapy, induced menopause, and medication
with erythropoietin on cognitive function in patients
with breast cancer. Cognitive function was assessed
before the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (T1),
toward the end (T2), and about 7 months after the
completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (T3). A
previous report on the effects of chemotherapy and
concomitant erythropoietin was based on data from
the first 2 assessments.16 The current report focuses
on the consequences of induced menopause and
antiestrogen therapy and comprises the data from all
3 assessments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
All patients were aged <66 years at T1; had nonmetastatic, invasive breast carcinoma that measured
2 cm or inflammatory lesions; and received 1 of 2
neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens containing

Effects of Hormonal Changes on Cognition/Hermelink et al

epirubicin, paclitaxel, and either cyclophosphamide
alone or cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil at 1 of 5 gynecologic or oncologic centers in
Bavaria, Germany. Details of the participation criteria, patient accrual, and chemotherapy regimens
have been reported previously.16 Chemotherapy was
followed by surgery with or without radiotherapy.
Patients with carcinomas that were positive for steroid hormone receptors received antiestrogen treatment with either tamoxifen (20 mg) or AIs
(anastrozole 1 mg or letrozole 2.5 mg) and additionally GnRH agonists when appropriate. Only the data
for patients who completed at least the first 2 assessments are considered here.
Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients. The study was approved by the ethics committees of all involved universities.

Assessments
Cognitive function was assessed before the start of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (T1), before the final
chemotherapy session—ie, approximately 5 months
later (T2)—and approximately 1 year after the baseline assessment (T3).
Twelve cognitive tests were used, including Logical
Memory I and II (verbal memory) from the Wechsler
Memory Scale Revised (WMS-R),37 Digit Span Forward
(verbal short-term memory, attention), and Digit Span
Backward (verbal working memory) from the WMSR,37 Digit Symbol (psychomotor function, information
processing speed) from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale-Revised,38 the d2 Test39 (concentration), Trail
Making Test Part A40 (TMT-A) (psychomotor function,
selective attention), TMT-B40 (psychomotor function,
divided attention, cognitive flexibility), and the
Regensburg Word Fluency Test (RWT)41 (executive
function) with 4 subtests (Category Fluency, Category
Fluency With Switch of Category, Letter Fluency, and
Letter Fluency With Switch of Letter). Anxiety and
depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS).42 Premorbid intelligence was assessed once at T2 using the MWT-B,43
which is a validated, German language-related test.
The tests and questionnaires were administered in a
fixed order either in a hospital or in patients’ homes
by 1 of 2 university-qualified psychologists.
Statistical Analysis
For statistical analysis, t tests or binomial tests, as
appropriate, were conducted for comparison with
test norms representative of the German population,37-39,41,43 with 2 exceptions: For the TMT-A and
TMT-B, test norms from a United States normative
study were used.44

To determine the effects of hormonal changes on
the test results, 2 factors were conceptualized: 1)
‘induced menopause,’ which included the transition
from premenopausal status at T1 to perimenopausal
or postmenopausal status at T2 or T3 and was
effected either by chemotherapy or by GnRH agonists
(patients with regular menses [last menstruation no
more than 6 weeks previously when assessed] were
considered premenopausal, and all other patients
were labeled postmenopausal); and 2) ‘antiestrogen
therapy,’ which comprised treatment with tamoxifen
or AIs. Linear mixed-effects models were used to
examine the effects of induced menopause and antiestrogen therapy on cognitive performance. Linear
mixed-effects models are suitable for accommodating data from multiple longitudinal assessments,
such as the 3 time points T1, T2, and T3 in this
study, and for simultaneously determining the effects
of multiple factors at a group level (‘fixed effects’)
and at an individual level (‘random effects’). Two of
12 cognitive tests, Digit Span Forward and Backward,
did not meet the statistical requirements for linear
mixed models—namely, continuity of data. For these
tests, rank-based linear models were used. With the
RWTs, parallel versions were administered at the different assessments; therefore, the raw data could not
be compared directly. Instead, percentage ranks corrected for age were used in the analysis.
In all models, 2 factor levels for induced menopause (present/not present) and 3 factor levels for
antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen/AIs/neither) were
introduced. Additional factors that were entered into
the models were premorbid intelligence, age, and
time of assessment (T1/T2/T3). The inclusion of
additional factors (HADS Anxiety, HADS Depression,
previous HRT, GnRH agonists as a separate factor)
and interactions (induced menopause with antiestrogen therapy) also were tested. These factors were
kept in the model only if their inclusion produced
significant results. In a second step, the significance
of factor effects was corrected for multiple testing
using the Bonferroni method.
Linear model analyses were carried out with the
MIXED procedure (SAS, version 9.1; SAS Inc., Cary,
NC). For all other analyses, the Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 15; SPSS, Chicago,
Ill) was used. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and significance was calculated with a 5% probability of error.

RESULTS
The T1 and T2 assessments were completed by 101
patients. At T3, 7 patients (7%) no longer met the
participation criteria for the presence of metastases,

yP < .05 for differences between marked groups.

2 patients (2%) declined further participation, and 92
patients completed the third assessment. The mean
age was 45.4 years for excluded patients and 48.7
years for nonexcluded patients (P 5 .71), and the
mean premorbid intelligence quotient was 105 for
excluded patients and 108 for nonexcluded patients
(P 5 .58).
At T1, 48 patients (47.5%) were premenopausal
(Fig. 1). At T3, menopause had occurred in 31 of
these patients (Fig. 1) and was induced either by
chemotherapy (22 patients) or by GnRH agonists (9
patients). These patients’ last menstruation dated
back a mean of 46 weeks at T3 (standard deviation
[SD], 11.3 weeks). Of 11 patients who were premenopausal at T3, 8 had experienced an induced menopause at T2 and had resumed menses after the
completion of chemotherapy. The patient groups
that were formed according to menopausal status at
T1 and T3 differed with regard to age (P < .001) and
intelligence (P 5 .025) (Table 1).

At T3, 62 patients (67.4%) had been receiving
antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen (49 patients;
53.3%) or with AIs (anastrozole, 9 patients; letrozole,
4 patients; total, 14.1%) for a mean of 19 weeks (SD,
6.3 weeks). More recipients than nonrecipients of
antiestrogen therapy had previously used HRT (P 5
.047) (Table 1).
The mean interval between the T1 and T2
assessments was 21 weeks (SD, 1.3 weeks). The T3
assessment took place a mean of 32 weeks (SD, 3.3
weeks) after T2, a mean of 53 weeks (SD, 3.3 weeks)
after T1, and a mean of 31 weeks (SD, 4 weeks) after
the completion of chemotherapy.
The test results for the T1 and T2 assessments
have been reported previously.16 At T3, the performance of the entire sample and of all subgroups,
which were composed according to menopausal status and antiestrogen therapy, ranged within or above
the test norms on all cognitive tests (see Table 2 for
test results).

Factors Predicting Cognitive Function
Significant negative effects of age were evident in
all cognitive tests except for the RWTs; with these
tests, the data introduced into the model already
were corrected for age (Table 3). Significance persisted in all but 1 test after correction for multiple
testing. Positive effects of intelligence and positive
effects of the assessment time retained significance in
9 tests and 5 tests, respectively, after correction for
multiple testing.

Fixed effects of induced menopause were significant in 3 tests. These effects were positive. After correction for multiple testing, significance still
persisted in 1 test (RWT Letter Fluency With Switch
of Letter) (Fig. 2). There also were 2 random effects
of induced menopause (Logical Memory I; P 5 .0199;
RWT Letter Fluency With Switch of Letter, P 5
.0286)—ie, in these tests, induced menopause had
individual effects that varied in a normally distributed way (positive and negative) around the mean

(fixed) effect of induced menopause. Significance did
not persist for these effects after correction for multiple testing. Entering therapy with GnRH agonists as a
separate factor into the models did not reveal any
significant effects.
No significant effects of antiestrogen therapy
emerged. The nonsignificant effects of antiestrogen
therapy and of tamoxifen and AIs separately were
partly positive and partly negative (data not shown);
thus, no trend was identified.
Further effects were identified that lost significance after correction for multiple testing: a negative
fixed effect of previous HRT (d2 Test; P 5 .0201), a
negative fixed effect of anxiety (Digit Symbol; P 5
.0298), and a positive fixed effect of induced menopause with antiestrogen therapy (RWT Category Fluency With Change of Category; P 5 .0466).

DISCUSSION
FIGURE 2. Results of the Letter Fluency With Switch of Letter subtest of
the Regensburg Word Fluency Test. Median scores are shown relative to
menopausal status at the start and the end of the study. Y-scale, percentage
ranks adjusted for age; blue indicates premenopausal before the start of
cancer therapy (T1) and 1 year after baseline (T3); red, induced menopause
at T3; green, postmenopausal at T1 and at T3.

In the current study, the effects of treatment-induced
hormonal changes on the course of cognitive function were assessed in a group of patients with breast
cancer, some of whom experienced induced menopause and/or started antiestrogen treatment with tamoxifen or AIs. No negative effects on cognition
emerged.

Effects of Hormonal Changes on Cognition/Hermelink et al

Age and intelligence were strong predictors of
cognitive performance, as expected. In addition, clear
effects of the assessment time in many tests indicated that improvement occurred over time, debatably suggesting preservation or even enhancement of
cognitive function despite chemotherapy. Still, the
study did not include a control group of patients
who were not receiving chemotherapy, and data
regarding practice effects during the third administrations of the cognitive tests used are lacking.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether
patients who were not treated with chemotherapy
would have improved to the same extent or more;
consequently, this observation cannot be interpreted.
A favorable influence of induced menopause
observed in 25% of the tests still was significant in 1
test after conservative correction for multiple testing.
This test is the most demanding of the 4 word fluency tests that were used. Word fluency tests are an
excellent way to determine whether and how well
individuals organize their thinking,45 because they
require building a strategy to guide the search for
words. Such tests are indicators of quite complex executive functioning.
In addition, individual effects of induced menopause that were favorable in some patients and unfavorable in others were observed in 2 tests. Although
these effects were not significant when multiple testing was taken into account, the possibility cannot be
excluded that menopause has individual effects,
including some decline in a subgroup of patients.
In contrast to the findings of the current study,
the only previous report to our knowledge on the
effects of treatment-induced menopause described
an increased rate of cognitive decline in affected
patients compared with initially postmenopausal
patients.13 However, the difference was not significant at the 95% level, and it had decreased further at
a follow-up assessment 1 year later.
No influence of treatment with tamoxifen or AI
on any cognitive domain was identified. This may be
because of a lack of statistical power. However, not
even a trend was evident—either for effects of antiestrogen therapy as a whole or for tamoxifen and AIs
separately.
Some (but not all) previous studies reported detrimental effects of tamoxifen3,7,32,33 or AIs,36 or
both35,46 on cognitive function. With the exceptions
of 1 small longitudinal study7 and 1 follow-up
study33 that reported minimal differences, these studies were limited by their cross-sectional design.
The current study also had some limitations.
First, it did not assess menopausal status by measuring hormone levels but relied solely on patients’

2437

reports of their menses. Therefore, the possibility
cannot be fully excluded that the classification of
menopausal status was incorrect in individual
women. Second, treatment-induced hormonal
changes dated back only a short interval at the
assessments. Thus, this study does not provide any
evidence concerning long-term effects of hormonal
changes caused by breast cancer therapy.
In contrast to what is believed widely, the current
findings suggest that women may fare even better
with postmenopausal estrogen levels in terms of cognitive function. Unfavorable effects of estrogen on
cognition have been reported previously. High natural estrogen levels have been associated with an
increased risk of dementia,24 and negative effects of
HRT on cognitive function were evident in the
WHIMS.25-27 However, the women who were
included in those studies were well beyond the menopausal transition, and the conclusions probably
cannot be generalized to younger women. Many studies have reported beneficial effects of HRT on cognitive function in women during or shortly after the
menopausal transition, but much of this evidence is
limited because of methodological problems. In nonrandomized studies, better health status and healthier lifestyle among HRT recipients even before the
start of HRT were not taken into account,47 resulting
in a ‘healthy user bias.’ In case-control studies that
retrospectively assessed the effect of HRT on the risk
of dementia, participants with dementia systematically underestimated their previous HRT use,48 and
proxy respondents may not have been aware of it.29
Most randomized controlled trials on this subject
have been small and produced mixed findings. Thus,
the evidence for effects of estrogen on cognition is
far from conclusive.
The current study identified favorable effects of
induced menopause on specific cognitive capacities.
There also was some indication of individual effects
of induced menopause, including deterioration in a
subgroup of patients. In contrast, antiestrogen treatment with tamoxifen or AIs did not affect cognition.
