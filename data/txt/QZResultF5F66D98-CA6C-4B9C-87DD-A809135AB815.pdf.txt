morbidity and mortality in children (1). Because a better
understanding of the tumor biology of neuroblastoma may lead
to biologically based therapies that are more effective and
less toxic, there has recently been much interest in identifying
molecular pathways that are involved in progression of neuroblastoma (4).
The phosphatidylinositol 3¶-kinase (PI3K) pathway, in particular,
seems to be one of the most potent prosurvival signaling pathways
(5). Deregulated signaling through the PI3K pathway is common in
many types of human malignancies, including glioblastoma and
breast, prostate, and lung cancers (5, 6). For example, activation of
the PI3K/Akt pathway has recently been reported to correlate with
increasing tumor grade, decreased apoptosis, and adverse clinical
outcome in glioblastoma in vivo (7, 8). Aberrant activation of the
PI3K/Akt pathway in cancers can be caused by genetic lesions [e.g.,
mutations of the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin
homologue (PTEN)] or by tyrosine kinase receptors stimulated by
growth factors [e.g., insulin-like growth factor (IGF), epidermal
growth factor, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); refs. 5,
9–11]. Critical mediators of PI3K, including Akt and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), are known to enhance cellular
survival by stimulating cell proliferation, glucose metabolism, or
angiogenesis and by actively suppressing apoptosis (5, 10). Akt is
a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by a dual regulatory
mechanism that requires both translocation to the plasma
membrane and phosphorylation of two key amino acids (5). On
growth factor stimulation, PI3K generates phosphatidylinositol
3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate,
which bind to the pleckstrin homology domains of Akt and
3¶-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), promoting their
translocation to the plasma membrane, where Akt becomes
phosphorylated in the catalytic domain at threonine 308 (T308)
by PDK-1 (5). In addition, Akt is phosphorylated in the regulatory
domain at serine 473 (S473) through mechanisms not completely
resolved (5). Phosphorylation of Akt at both T308 and S473 is
required for full kinase activity (5).
Programmed cell death or apoptosis plays a pivotal role in the
regulation of tissue homeostasis, which is maintained by a balance
between proliferation and cell death (12–14). Accordingly, a
reduction of the physiological rate of apoptosis may contribute
to tumor formation and progression (15). In addition, apoptosis
has been implicated to mediate therapy-induced cytotoxicity (e.g.,
following chemotherapy, g-irradiation, or immunotherapy; ref. 13).
Apoptosis pathways may be initiated through the extrinsic (death
receptor) or intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway, resulting in activation of effector caspases (13). Stimulation of death receptors of
the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily such as
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors results
in activation of caspase-8, which initiates direct cleavage of downstream effector caspases (16). The mitochondrial pathway is, for
example, engaged in response to cytotoxic drug treatment and

Abstract
Whereas aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3¶kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, a key survival cascade, has
previously been linked to poor prognosis in several human
malignancies, its prognostic effect in neuroblastoma has not
yet been explored. We therefore investigated the phosphorylation status of Akt, S6 ribosomal protein as target of
mammalian target of rapamycin, and extracellular signal–
regulated kinase (ERK) in 116 primary neuroblastoma
samples by tissue microarray and its correlation with
established prognostic markers and survival outcome. Here,
we provide for the first time evidence that phosphorylation
of Akt at serine 473 (S473) and/or threonine 308 (T308), S6
ribosomal protein, and ERK frequently occurs in primary
neuroblastoma. Importantly, we identified Akt activation as
a novel prognostic indicator of decreased event-free or overall
survival in neuroblastoma, whereas phosphorylation of S6
ribosomal protein or ERK had no prognostic effect. In
addition, Akt activation correlated with variables of aggressive disease, including MYCN amplification, 1p36 aberrations,
advanced disease stage, age at diagnosis, and unfavorable
histology. Monitoring Akt at T308 or both phosphorylation
sites improved the prognostic significance of Akt activation in
neuroblastoma specimens compared with S473 phosphorylation. Parallel experiments in neuroblastoma cell lines revealed
that activation of Akt by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I
significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosisinducing ligand– or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in a
PI3K-dependent manner because the PI3K inhibitor LY294002
completely reversed the IGF-I–mediated protection of neuroblastoma cells from apoptosis. By showing that activation of
Akt correlates with poor prognosis in primary neuroblastoma
in vivo and with apoptosis resistance in vitro, our findings
indicate that Akt presents a clinically relevant target in
neuroblastoma that warrants further investigation. [Cancer

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in
childhood and accounts for 7% to 10% of pediatric malignancies
(1). Currently, even intensive, multimodality therapy has resulted in
only modest improvement in the cure rate of the more aggressive
neuroblastoma (2, 3). Neuroblastoma is a leading cause of

progression of disease, and death from disease were counted as events.
Overall survival was calculated as the time from diagnosis to death, or
last examination if the patient survived. Death resulting from therapy
complications (n = 6) as well as development of secondary malignant
disease (n = 1) was censored for event-free survival and overall survival
analysis.

involves the release of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c
or second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac)/direct
inhibitor of apoptosis– binding protein with low isoelectric point
(DIABLO), from mitochondria into the cytosol, triggering caspase-3
activation as a result of formation of the apoptosome complex (17).
Despite growing interest in the PI3K/Akt pathway as cancer
drug target in recent years (18, 19), the activation status and the
potential clinical prognostic value of components of this pathway
have not yet been explored in clinical specimens in neuroblastoma.
Therefore, we investigated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and
its correlation with established prognostic markers and survival
outcome in a large cohort of neuroblastoma patients in the present
study. Parallel experiments in neuroblastoma cell lines were
designed to analyze the effect of elevated PI3K/Akt signaling on
apoptosis sensitivity.

Cell Culture and Chemicals
Neuroblastoma cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 or DMEM
(Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany), supplemented with 10%
FCS (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 1 mmol/L glutamine (Biochrom),
1% penicillin/streptavidin (Biochrom), and 25 mmol/L HEPES (Biochrom)
as previously described (21). Chemicals were purchased from Sigma
(Deisenhofen, Germany) unless otherwise indicated, IGF-I or IGF-II from
Biochrom, recombinant TRAIL from R&D Systems, Inc. (Wiesbaden,
Germany), and doxorubicin, cisplatin, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002
from Sigma.

Determination of Apoptosis

Materials and Methods

For determination of apoptosis, SH-EP or SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells
(0.5  105/cm2 and 1  105/cm2, respectively) were seeded in 24-well plates
(Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany), allowed to settle for 24 h, washed once
with PBS (Biochrom), pretreated or not with IGF-I or IGF-II for 4 h or
with LY294002 for 1 h, and then treated with TRAIL, doxorubicin, or
cisplatin in the presence or absence of IGF-I, IGF-II, or LY294002 in serumfree medium. Apoptosis was determined by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS; FACScan, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) analysis
of DNA fragmentation of propidium iodide–stained nuclei as previously
described (21). The percentage of specific apoptosis was calculated as
follows: 100  [experimental apoptosis (%)] / [100% spontaneous apoptosis in medium (%)].

Tissue Microarray
Patients. A total of 116 patients of the Cooperative German Neuroblastoma Trials NB90, NB95, and NB97 were analyzed by tissue microarray.
Briefly, representative tissue blocks were selected as donor blocks for the
tissue microarray. Sections were cut from each donor block and stained
with H&E. Using these slides, one morphologically representative region
was chosen from each of the 116 neuroblastoma samples. One cylindrical
core tissue specimen per tumor block (diameter, 2.0 mm) was punched
from these regions and precisely arrayed into a new recipient paraffin
block using a custom-built precision instrument (Beecher Instruments,
Silver Spring, MD). Tumor samples were taken before chemotherapy.
Characteristics of patients’ tumors are summarized in Supplementary
Table S1.
Immunohistochemistry. Three-micrometer sections were prepared
from the tissue microarray and mounted onto silane-coated glass slides.
Immunohistochemical analyses were done with rabbit anti–phospho-Akt
(S473) monoclonal antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), rabbit anti–
phospho-Akt (T308) monoclonal antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling), rabbit
anti–phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (S235/236) polyclonal antibody (1:400;
Cell Signaling), and rabbit anti–phospho-extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK; T202/Y204) monoclonal antibody (E10; 1:400; Cell Signaling).
Pretreatment for antigen retrieval was done with pressure cooker
(10 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer pH 6.0, 10 min). After blockage of biotin
and peroxidase, immunohistochemical staining was done on an automated
immunostainer (i6000, Biogenex, San Ramon, CA) using the standard
labeled streptavidin-biotin method (UltraTek Reagent Detection Kit, Scy
Tek, Logan, UT) followed by 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine enzymatic development.
Sections were counterstained blue with hematoxylin. Omission of the
primary antibody served as negative control. Immunohistochemical
stainings were evaluated by a pathologist (C.P.), who was blinded to all
clinical variables, semiquantitatively by percentage of stained tumor cells
and staining intensity (low phosphorylation: intermediate or strong staining
in <1% of tumor cells; high phosphorylation: intermediate or strong staining
in >50% of tumor cells).
Analysis of MYCN amplification and chromosomal alterations.
Determination of the MYCN status was assessed in neuroblastoma tumors
by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), PCR, or Southern blot analysis.
According to the European Network for Quality Assurance in Higher Education guidelines (20), MYCN amplification was defined as a >4-fold increase
of MYCN signal number in relation to the number of chromosomes 2.
Chromosomal aberrations in 1p36 were investigated in neuroblastoma
tumors using FISH or PCR.
Statistical analysis of tissue microarray. To compare variables of
interest, m2 test or Fisher’s exact test was used where appropriate. Survival
curves were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier and compared with
log-rank test. Event-free survival was calculated as the time from diagnosis
to event, or last examination if the patient had no event. Recurrence,

Surface Staining
To analyze expression of IGF receptor, 5  105 nonfixed SH-EP and SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells were incubated with IGF-I receptor monoclonal
antibody (Oncogene, Bad Soden, Germany) or antimouse immunoglobulin
G (IgG)-1 control antibody (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) for 30 min at 4jC,
washed once with PBS containing 1% FCS, incubated for 30 min at 4jC in
the dark with secondary antimouse phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody
(Dako), washed once with PBS containing 1% FCS, and then analyzed by
flow cytometry.

Western Blot Analysis
Neuroblastoma cells seeded overnight in 10-cm plates or 75-cm2 flasks
were treated or not with IGF-I, IGF-II, or LY294002 in medium containing
0% FCS or 10% FCS for indicated time points. Cells were lysed for 15 min
on ice in lysis buffer [30 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1% Triton-X, 10% glycerol, 2 mmol/L DTT, 200 Amol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 nmol/L okadaic acid, 1 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L sodium fluoride, and a
mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)], followed
by high-speed centrifugation. Fifty micrograms of lysate were separated on
a 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBS supplemented
with 5% milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were stained
overnight with primary antibody, followed by 1-h incubation with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody, and detection
was done with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia).
The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti–phospho-Akt (S473)
polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), rabbit anti–phospho-Akt
(T308) monoclonal antibody (244F9; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling), mouse antiAkt monoclonal antibody (1:500; BD Bioscience), rabbit anti–phospho-S6
ribosomal protein (S235/236) polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling),
rabbit anti–S6 ribosomal protein polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Cell
Signaling), mouse anti–phospho-ERK (T202/Y204) monoclonal antibody
(E10; 1:2,000; Cell Signaling), or rabbit anti-ERK polyclonal antibody
(1:10,000; Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-mouse

full activation of Akt requires phosphorylation of two key amino
acids in the regulatory (S473) and catalytic domains (T308; ref. 5),
we monitored phosphorylation of both sites to allow a thorough
analysis of Akt activation. We found that Akt was highly
phosphorylated at S473 in 61.2% (71 of 116) and at T308 in 62.9%
(73 of 116) of primary neuroblastoma (Fig. 1A). Of 116 tumors,
66 (56.9%) were positive for both phosphospecific Akt antibodies
(Fig. 1A and B). Five of 116 (4.3%) of neuroblastoma specimens
were positive for S473 phosphorylation but not T308 phosphorylation, whereas 7 of 116 (6%) were positive for T308 phosphorylation but not S473 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Thirty-eight of
116 (32.8%) tumors showed low phosphorylation of both sites
(Fig. 1B). Strong phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein, a target
of mTOR, occurred in 55.2% (64 of 116) of neuroblastoma samples

Results
Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in primary neuroblastoma samples. Whereas the PI3K/Akt pathway has elicited intense
interest as drug target in several types of cancer (6–8), its activation
status has not yet been explored in neuroblastoma in vivo.
Therefore, we analyzed phosphorylation of Akt, a target of PI3K,
and S6 ribosomal protein, a target of mTOR, as read-outs for
activation of upstream and downstream components of the
pathway by immunohistochemistry using a human tissue microarray composed of 116 primary neuroblastoma specimens. Because

may exist, which can both be activated by ligation of growth factor
receptors (9). Together, this set of experiments shows that
phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and/or T308 as well as
phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein and ERK occurs in a
large proportion of neuroblastoma specimens. This indicates that
the PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways are frequently activated
in neuroblastoma in vivo.
Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and advanced disease.
We next asked whether or not activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
was associated with variables of advanced disease in neuroblastoma. To address this question, we correlated phosphorylation of Akt,
S6 ribosomal protein, or ERK with various established variables
used for prognostic stratification of neuroblastoma, including
MYCN amplification, 1p36 aberrations, stage of disease, age at diagnosis, and tumor histology (1). Interestingly, we found that high
phosphorylation of Akt at S473, T308, or both phosphorylation sites
significantly correlated with MYCN amplification or 1p36 aberrations (Table 1A and B). The level of significance increased for
correlation of Akt phosphorylation and MYCN amplification, when
phosphorylation at T308 or at both sites was assessed compared
with phosphorylation at S473 (Table 1A). In addition, there was a

(Fig. 1A). Because interactions between the PI3K/Akt and the Raf/
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK pathways
have been described (22–24), we also assessed phosphorylation
of ERK, a direct target of MEK. High phosphorylation of ERK
was detected in 48.3% (56 of 116) of primary neuroblastoma
specimens (Fig. 1A). Representative immunohistochemical stainings of phospho-Akt (S473 and T308), phospho-S6 ribosomal
protein, and phospho-ERK are shown in Fig. 1C.
We also investigated whether there is a correlation among the
phosphorylation status of Akt, S6 ribosomal protein, and ERK.
We found a correlation of phosphorylation of Akt at S473, T308, or
both S473 and T308 and S6 ribosomal protein (P = 0.004, P = 0.004,
and P = 0.001, respectively; m2 test), phosphorylation of Akt at S473
and T308 (P = <0.001, m2 test), phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal
protein and ERK (P = <0.001, m2 test), as well as phosphorylation
of Akt at S473 or both S473 and T308 and ERK (P = 0.036 and
P = 0.015, respectively; m2 test), whereas there was no correlation of
phosphorylation of Akt at T308 and ERK (P = 0.18, m2 test). These
results may reflect that Akt and S6 ribosomal protein are upstream
and downstream components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and
that cross-talks between ERK and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway

improved the predictive prognostic value of Akt activation
compared with Akt phosphorylation at S473. In contrast, high
phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein or ERK was not associated
with event-free or overall survival of neuroblastoma patients
(Fig. 2B and C; Table 2). These findings show that high phosphorylation of Akt, but not of S6 ribosomal protein as read-out of
mTOR activity or ERK, predicts event-free and overall survival of
neuroblastoma patients.
Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in neuroblastoma cell
lines. Next, we asked whether or not the PI3K/Akt pathway was
constitutively activated in neuroblastoma cell lines. To address this
question, we cultured a panel of human neuroblastoma cell lines
for 24 h in the absence of serum (0% FCS) or, for comparison, in
the presence of serum (10% FCS). As shown in Fig. 3, we found no
constitutive phosphorylation of Akt at S473 in neuroblastoma cell
lines after complete serum deprivation for 24 h. Some phosphorylation of Akt at S473 was detected in SK-N-SH, SK-N-BE, SH-EP,
SH-SY5Y, and IMR32 neuroblastoma cell lines when cells were
cultured in medium containing 10% FCS (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation
of S6 ribosomal protein, a downstream target of mTOR, was not
detectable in most neuroblastoma cell lines and low in SH-EP
neuroblastoma cells under serum deprivation (Fig. 3). Variable
phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein was found in neuroblastoma cell lines cultured in medium containing 10% FCS (Fig. 3).
By comparison, ERK was phosphorylated in SK-N-SH, SK-N-AS,
SH-EP, and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and, to some extent, also

stronger correlation between phosphorylation of both Akt sites and
1p36 aberrations compared with either phosphorylation site alone
(Table 1B). Moreover, Akt phosphorylation at T308 or at both sites,
but not at S473, correlated with stage IV disease, age >24 months
at diagnosis, and unfavorable histology according to Shimada
classification (Table 1C, F, and G). These findings indicate that
monitoring Akt at T308 or both phosphorylation sites improves
the assessment of Akt activation. In contrast, no significant
association was observed between high phosphorylation of S6
ribosomal protein or ERK and any of the variables tested (Table 1).
Thus, Akt activation, but not phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal
protein as read-out of mTOR activity or ERK, correlates with
variables of advanced disease in neuroblastoma.
Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and survival. We then
went on to evaluate the prognostic value of the PI3K/Akt pathway
in neuroblastoma. All patients were treated according to the
protocols of the Cooperative German Neuroblastoma Trials (NB90,
NB95, and NB97). The cumulative event-free survival curves of
neuroblastoma patients with high or low phosphorylation of
Akt, S6 ribosomal protein, or ERK in tumor samples are shown
in Fig. 2, and 3-year event-free and overall survival of patients
are summarized in Table 2. Importantly, we found that high
phosphorylation of Akt at S473, T308, or both sites significantly
correlated with reduced event-free and overall survival in KaplanMeier analysis for the group of 116 neuroblastoma patients (Fig. 2A;
Table 2). Monitoring Akt at T308 or both phosphorylation sites

strong phosphorylation of AktS473 and S6 ribosomal protein
(Fig. 3). By comparison, phosphorylation of ERK was enhanced
by IGF-I in some cell lines (i.e., SK-N-BE, SK-N-AS, Kelly, and IMR32
cells; Fig. 3). Monitoring Akt phosphorylation at T308 yielded
similar results compared with phosphorylation of Akt at S473
in neuroblastoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). We therefore assessed Akt phosphorylation at S473 to determine Akt activation in SH-EP and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in subsequent

absence of serum (Fig. 3). U87MG glioblastoma cells were used as
a positive control for constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, S6
ribosomal protein, and ERK even under serum deprivation (Fig. 3).
Growth factors (e.g., IGF-I) are known to stimulate Akt (10).
Because the IGF system has been implicated to play an important
role in neuroblastoma biology (11), we next used IGF-I to activate
Akt. Stimulation of neuroblastoma cells with IGF-I resulted in

Role of Akt in Neuroblastoma

cultured in medium containing 10% FCS and strong activation of
Akt occurs on stimulation with IGF-I.
Activation of Akt rescues neuroblastoma cells from cytotoxic drug– or TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In light of our findings
that activation of Akt correlates with poor prognosis in neuroblastoma, we wished to explore in more detail the role of the PI3K/Akt
survival cascade in regulating apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells.
To address this issue, we used IGF-I to stimulate Akt activation in
prototype S-type (SH-EP) and N-type (SH-SY5Y) neuroblastoma
cell lines. S-type (substrate adherent) and N-type (neuroblastic) cell
lines are considered to correspond to distinct cell types present in
human neuroblastoma tumors (25).
As shown in Fig. 4A, both SH-EP and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
cells express IGF receptor on their cell surface. Stimulation with
IGF-I resulted in rapid and prolonged phosphorylation of Akt
(Fig. 4B). In addition, treatment with IGF-I rapidly triggered
phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (Fig. 4B). Compared with
Akt, phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein was transient and
declined after 24 h, and then became undetectable at 48 h (Fig. 4B).
Because childhood tumors such as neuroblastoma have been
reported to preferentially express IGF-II (26), we also compared
activation of Akt by IGF-I and IGF-II. As shown in Fig. 4B, IGF-I
and IGF-II similarly stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in SH-EP
neuroblastoma cells. Because we observed no differences between
IGF-I and IGF-II in their ability to activate Akt, we used IGF-I for
further experiments.
Next, we investigated whether or not activation of Akt
interferes with the ability of neuroblastoma cells to undergo
apoptosis. To this end, SH-EP and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells
were left untreated or were pretreated with IGF-I for 4 h to
stimulate Akt before apoptosis was induced in the presence or
absence of IGF-I. Importantly, activation of Akt by pretreatment
with IGF-I significantly reduced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in
both SH-EP and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Similarly, activation of Akt by
pretreatment with IGF-I resulted in a significant decrease of
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in SH-EP and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
cells (Fig. 4C).
To examine whether or not apoptosis resistance mediated by Akt
was restricted to cytotoxic drugs, which predominately activate

Role of Akt in Neuroblastoma

experiments in neuroblastoma cell lines showing that activation
of Akt by IGF-I protected neuroblastoma cells from TRAILor chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in a PI3K-dependent manner.
Together, these data suggest that Akt presents a clinically
relevant target to enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic therapies in
neuroblastoma.
Aberrant activation of Akt has previously been linked to poor
prognosis in other human malignancies (e.g., glioblastoma and
breast carcinoma; refs. 6, 7). Our study is the first to report a
correlation between the activation status of Akt and reduced
survival in neuroblastoma. Thus, it extends the clinical relevance of
Akt to the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood.
Assessment of Akt activation by monitoring phosphorylation at
T308 or at both T308 and S473 improved the prognostic
significance of Akt activation in neuroblastoma specimens
compared with determining only S473 phosphorylation. Similarly,
evaluation of both Akt phosphorylation sites has recently been
reported to improve the assessment of Akt activation in non–
small-cell lung cancer (30). This may reflect that phosphorylation
of both sites is required for full activation of Akt (5). Accordingly,
S473 phosphorylation does not necessarily correlate with Akt
activity (e.g., in PDK-1-deficient cells that lack T308 phosphorylation on IGF-I stimulation; ref. 31). Thus, evaluation of both T308
and S473 phosphorylation may be a better surrogate for Akt
activity in clinical specimens. Our finding that Akt activation
correlated with several variables of aggressive disease in neuroblastoma, including MYCN amplification, 1p36 aberrations, advanced
disease stage, age at diagnosis, and unfavorable histology, may
reflect its association with poor prognosis. Alternatively, correlation of phosphorylated Akt with MYCN amplification and 1p36
aberrations may point to a novel link between Akt and genetic
aberrations in neuroblastoma because activation of Akt has
recently been reported to contribute to genomic instability of
tumor cells (32, 33). However, whether or not such a link between
Akt and genomic instability exists in neuroblastoma is subject
to future investigations. Because only phosphorylation of Akt,
but not of ERK or S6 ribosomal protein, was prognostically
significant, although there was a correlation among the three
phospho-proteins analyzed, these findings suggest that these
proteins may primarily control distinct pathways with differential
prognostic effects (e.g., metabolism, differentiation, cell death,
and survival).
The PI3K/Akt pathway can be up-regulated in human cancers
through several mechanisms. Perhaps the most commonly known
mechanisms comprise mutations or deletions of key components
of the signaling cascade (e.g., PTEN or PIK3CA) or through
amplification or overexpression of critical growth factor receptors
(9, 10, 34). The cause of Akt activation in neuroblastoma may
involve deregulated growth factor signaling (e.g., triggered by the
IGF system in a paracrine or autocrine manner; ref. 11). In support
of this notion, we found strong phosphorylation of Akt in
neuroblastoma cells stimulated with IGF-I or IGF-II in line with
other reports (35, 36). As neuroblastoma is a tumor of the neural
crest, neurotrophins and their receptors (e.g., nerve growth factor/
TrkA and BDNF/TrkB) are also likely involved in regulating Akt
activation in vivo (1). BDNF/TrkB stimulation has been reported
to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway in neuroblastoma cells (37–39).
It will be subject to future studies to explore activators of Akt
in neuroblastoma in vivo (e.g., by correlating Akt phosphorylation
with expression of TrkA, TrkB, or IGF receptors and their corresponding ligands). Deletions of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, an

the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, we then extended our studies to
the extrinsic pathway using the death receptor ligand TRAIL. In
addition, activation of Akt by IGF-I significantly reduced TRAILinduced apoptosis in SH-EP cells (Fig. 4C). TRAIL could not
be assessed in SH-SY5Y cells because they lack expression of
caspase-8, which is an essential component of the apoptotic
signal transduction pathway triggered by TRAIL (27). Together,
these findings show that activation of Akt by IGF-I reduces
anticancer drug– or TRAIL-induced apoptosis in both S- and
N-type neuroblastoma cells.
Inhibition of PI3K/Akt abolishes IGF-I–mediated protection
against doxorubicin- or TRAIL-induced apoptosis. IGF-I has
been reported to mediate survival via the PI3K/Akt and/or Raf/
MEK/ERK pathway (28). Therefore, to further elucidate the specific
contribution of PI3K/Akt to IGF-I–mediated apoptosis resistance,
we used LY294002, a competitive and reversible inhibitor of the
ATP-binding site of PI3K (29). To analyze whether or not inhibition
of PI3K by LY294002 was effective in neuroblastoma cells, we
determined phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream target of PI3K,
by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, LY294002
strongly inhibited phosphorylation of Akt in response to stimulation with IGF-I in a concentration-dependent manner. Next, we
investigated the ability of IGF-I to protect neuroblastoma cells
against doxorubicin- or TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the presence
or absence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Importantly, inhibition
of PI3K by LY294002 completely reversed the IGF-I–mediated
protection against doxorubicin- or TRAIL-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 5C and D). This shows that IGF-I confers resistance towards
doxorubicin- or TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a PI3K-dependent
manner in neuroblastoma cells.

Discussion
Despite intensive, multimodality therapy, the cure rate of
advanced neuroblastoma has only modestly improved in recent
years (1). Therefore, a better understanding of the pathways
responsible for neuroblastoma progression and treatment
resistance may lead to the development of more effective, less
toxic therapies (4). The PI3K/Akt pathway is a key mediator of
cell survival signals, and human malignancies with high active
Akt levels have been reported to be resistant to various treatments (5, 18). Whereas deregulated signaling via the PI3K/Akt
pathway has been associated with poor prognosis in several
human cancers (5), the question whether or not the activation
status of key components of this survival cascade bears prognostic
effect on outcome in neuroblastoma has not previously been
addressed.
Here, we provide for the first time evidence that phosphorylation
of Akt at S473 and/or T308, S6 ribosomal protein, and ERK is a
frequent event in neuroblastoma. Moreover, we identified Akt
activation as a novel prognostic indicator of reduced event-free or
overall survival in neuroblastoma. In addition, Akt activation
correlated with established variables of aggressive disease,
including MYCN amplification, 1p36 aberrations, advanced disease
stage, age at diagnosis, and unfavorable histology. Monitoring Akt
at T308 or both phosphorylation sites compared with S473
phosphorylation improved the assessment of Akt activation in
neuroblastoma samples. In contrast to Akt, phosphorylation of S6
ribosomal protein or ERK did not correlate with survival or
variables of advanced disease in neuroblastoma. The findings in
primary neuroblastoma samples were corroborated by parallel

activation of Akt may promote progression of neuroblastoma.
In addition, recombinant soluble TRAIL and agonistic TRAIL
receptor antibodies are currently evaluated in early clinical trials
for the treatment of cancer. Thus, strategies to enhance the
efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies (e.g., small-molecule PI3K
inhibitors) are particularly interesting for molecular targeted
cancer therapy in neuroblastoma.
By showing that high phosphorylation of Akt in vivo correlates
with reduced survival of neuroblastoma patients and that
activation of Akt protects neuroblastoma cells against TRAIL- or
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, our results indicate that Akt
plays an important role in promoting survival in neuroblastoma.
These findings have clinical implications for the development of
experimental approaches in neuroblastoma therapy because
resistance to undergo programmed cell death is a major cause of
nonresponsiveness of cancers, such as neuroblastoma, leading to
treatment failure. Thus, Akt represents a clinically relevant target
(e.g., using small-molecule inhibitors) to enhance the efficacy of
anticancer therapy and to attain therapeutic gain in the treatment
of neuroblastoma.

antagonists of PI3K signaling, are rare in neuroblastoma (40),
whereas PTEN mutations are a frequent cause of aberrant activation of PI3K/Akt in glioblastoma (41). Collectively, these findings
support a model where activation of Akt in neuroblastoma may
predominantly be caused by elevated signaling through growth
factor receptors, promoting growth and conferring resistance to
cell death.
Our findings that activation of Akt by IGF-I protected
neuroblastoma cells against TRAIL- or cytotoxic drug–induced
apoptosis are in line with mounting evidence that activation of
this survival cascade can rescue neuroblastoma cells from cell
death (e.g., in response to anticancer agents). To this end, aberrant
stimulation of the BDNF/TrkB pathway was reported to enhance
resistance of neuroblastoma cells to chemotherapy in a PI3Kdependent manner (37, 39). Using pharmacologic and genetic
tools, Akt was recently identified as a key component of the
BDNF/TrkB–mediated survival signaling and chemoresistance in
neuroblastoma cells (38). Previously, IGF-I has been reported to
rescue neuroblastoma cells from hyperosmotic stress–, peroxynitrite-, hypoxia-, doxorubicin-, or TNFa-induced apoptosis (36,
42–45). Our study extends these findings by showing that IGF-I
also protects neuroblastoma cells from apoptosis induced by the
death-inducing ligand TRAIL. Together, these data indicate that
activation of Akt by IGF-I confers resistance to neuroblastoma
cells against a variety of cytotoxic stimuli. Because there is
accumulating evidence that TRAIL may play an important role as
effector molecule of the innate immune response in tumor
surveillance (46), protection from TRAIL-induced apoptosis by
