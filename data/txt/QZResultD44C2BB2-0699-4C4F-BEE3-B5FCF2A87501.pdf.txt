BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in most developed countries. Radiotherapy is important in its treatment, with an estimated optimal utilization rate between 45% and 68% at initial diagnosis. The
objective of this study was to describe radiotherapy practice for lung cancer in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
METHODS: Patients with lung cancer were identified prospectively from the NSW Central Cancer Registry (CCR)
from November 1, 2001 to December 31, 2002. Questionnaires were mailed to diagnosing and treating clinicians to
obtain detailed information on diagnosis, staging, referrals, and treatment. The authors describe referral for and
receipt of radiotherapy treatment. RESULTS: Of 1812 patients with lung cancer patients who were identified, 943
patients (52%) were referred for radiotherapy, 846 patients (47%) received a radiotherapy questionnaire, and 727
patients (40%) received radiotherapy. Compared with optimal radiotherapy, there was less curative radiotherapy to
the primary site (20% actual vs 50% optimal), and there was more palliative radiotherapy to metastatic sites (36%
actual vs 11% optimal). The greatest shortfall in radiotherapy use was observed in patients who had limited stage
small cell lung cancer (46% actual vs 94% optimal). The use of combined-modality treatment for stage III nonsmall
cell lung cancer and for limited stage small cell lung cancer was uncommon. CONCLUSIONS: There is underutilization
of radiotherapy for lung cancer in NSW, especially in small cell lung cancer. The use of combined-modality treatment
for potentially curable lung cancers is suboptimal. These issues have to be addressed to improve survival and quality

Lung cancer is the most common cancer after nonmelanoma skin cancer and is overwhelmingly the leading cause of
cancer death in the more developed countries of the world. In 2002, lung cancer accounted for an estimated 22% of all
cancer deaths in these countries.1 This disproportionately high contribution to cancer death reflects the generally poor
outcome of patients with lung cancer. The most recent reports indicate that the 5-year relative survival rate from lung cancer in the United States was 13.5%, and 18.2% for men and women, respectively (patients diagnosed from 1996 through
2004)2; 13% and 18%, respectively, in Canada (patients diagnosed from 1997 through 1999)3; and 10.7% and 14%,
respectively, in Australia (patients diagnosed from 1998 through 2004).4 In Europe, the percentage for both sexes was
10.9% (patients diagnosed from 2000 through 2002).5 Although these rates are low overall, survival from lung cancer can
be maximized by the optimal use of potentially curative therapy.6,7
Radiotherapy is an integral component of treatment for lung cancer and can be effective whether it is given
with curative or palliative intent.8 Many patients who receive radiotherapy also are likely to benefit from chemotherapy. Since the 1990s, evidence has emerged for the use of chemotherapy with radiotherapy in the curative treatment
of stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).9,10 It also has been demonstrated that the addition of thoracic
radiotherapy to chemotherapy in limited stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is beneficial.11,12 Both of these

combinations result in superior survival compared with
single-modality treatment. If radiotherapy was used
optimally in lung cancer, with or without chemotherapy, then it is estimated that some 45% to 68% of
patients would receive it at initial diagnosis; and, overall, 61% to 76% of patients would receive it.13,14
Few attempts have been made to determine the proportion of lung cancer patients that receive optimal
radiotherapy. Australian studies performed in 1993 and
1996 observed actual overall utilization rates ranging
from 39% to 55%.15,16 The reasons why lung cancer
patients do not receive optimal radiotherapy have not
been explained well, although they are likely to include a
variety of patient, clinician, and health service delivery
factors.
To determine how lung cancer patients were being
managed, we conducted a patterns of care study in the
Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). The key
findings from that study have been published.17 In this
report, we describe patterns of care in patients who were
referred for radiotherapy, in particular to document radiotherapy use and to compare it with the estimated optimal
radiotherapy management of lung cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
New South Wales is the most populous state in Australia
with a population of 6.3 million in 2001.18 A Lung Cancer Patterns of Care Study was performed there covering
residents who were diagnosed with primary lung cancer
between November 1, 2001 and December 31, 2002. Eligible patients were ascertained from notifications to the
population-based NSW Central Cancer Registry (CCR).
Patients provided informed consent for their treatment
details to be obtained from their physicians. If a patient
had died, then ethics approval allowed treatment information to be obtained with the physician’s consent. This
study was approved by the required human research ethics
committees. The methods have been described elsewhere.17 At the time of the study, there were 14 individual
radiotherapy facilities in NSW.
Four separate treatment questionnaires were developed by an expert advisory group to collect information
on 1) patient demographics, clinical characteristics, investigations, referrals, and management; 2) surgery; 3) radiotherapy; and 4) chemotherapy. The sample in this report
comprises patients who were referred to a radiation oncologist for whom a completed radiotherapy questionnaire
was obtained.

Disease stage for SCLC was assigned using the Veterans Administration staging system.19 NSCLC and cancers with no pathologic confirmation (NPC) were staged
using the TNM classification.20 Performance status was
scored using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) scale.21 Each patient’s place of residence was
coded according to the distance to major service centers
using the Accessibility and Remoteness Index for
Australia.22
Collected data were entered into an Access database
and analyzed using SAS statistical software version 9.1.
Chi-square tests of association were used to identify factors related to the intent of radiotherapy. Multivariate
logistic regression was used to analyze the following factors associated with treatment intent: age, sex, disease
stage, pathology, weight loss, ECOG performance status,
comorbidities, and lung cancer specialist caseload. Odds
ratios adjusted for all of these variables are reported.

RESULTS
Patient Referral Characteristics
There were 2931 potentially eligible patients registered by
the CCR, and 2126 of those patients (73%) participated
in the study. Patients were excluded because of a lack of
patient or physician consent (n ¼ 483), inability to contact patient or physician (n ¼ 198), or delayed notification to the CCR (n ¼ 124). Diagnosis and treatment data
were available for 1812 patients. Of these, 943 patients
were referred to a radiation oncologist (Fig. 1). We
obtained a completed radiotherapy questionnaire for 846
(89%) patients who were referred to radiotherapy.
Patients who were referred had a median age at diagnosis of 69 years, and 67% were men (Table 1). Seventytwo percent of these patients had at least 1 comorbid
condition that was likely to affect management, most
commonly chronic airflow limitation or cardiovascular
disease. Despite this, 81% of patients had a good performance status (ECOG 0-2).
Patients who were referred to a radiation oncologist
were younger, had a better performance status, and were
less likely to have comorbidities than older patients. They
were more likely to live in areas that were highly accessible
to service centers and were more likely to have pathologic
confirmation of their lung cancer. Patients with stage III
and IV NSCLC and limited stage SCLC were overrepresented in the radiotherapy group.
The majority of referrals to a radiation oncologist
occurred at initial diagnosis (61%), and the remaining

referrals occurred after another treating clinician was consulted (30%) (Table 2). A large proportion of patients
who were referred at initial diagnosis had stage III or IV
NSCLC/NPC (78%) and extensive stage SCLC (71%).
This pattern was similar after a treating clinician was consulted, with the exception of patients with limited stage
SCLC, in which a larger proportion was referred to a radiation oncologist after a treating clinician was consulted
compared with the proportion referred at initial diagnosis
(47% vs 29%).
Investigations
Pulmonary function tests were performed in less than half
of all patients who were seen by a radiation oncologist
(44%). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were
obtained in 95% of patients, brain CT scans were
obtained in 40%, bone scans were obtained in 46%, and
positron emission tomography scans were obtained in
21%. Fifty-three percent of patients had a bronchoscopy.
Patients with NPC histology were less likely to have most
investigations, whereas patients with SCLC had proportionally almost twice as many brain CT scans and bone
scans as patients who were diagnosed with NSCLC.
Pathway to Radiotherapy Treatment
Of the patients who were seen by radiation oncologists
(n ¼ 846), 86 (10%) were not suitable for radiotherapy.

688

The reasons recorded were no clinical indication in 31
patients, poor performance status in 16 patients, patient
decision in 16 patients, other reasons in 21 patients, and
unknown in 2 patients. Of the 760 patients who were
suitable for radiotherapy, 708 actually commenced radiotherapy. An additional 19 patients had radiotherapy treatment indicated in other treatment questionnaires, but no
radiotherapy questionnaire data were available. Thus, up
to 727 patients received some form of radiotherapy. Of
the 708 patients with questionnaire data available, 638
(90%) completed their planned course. The reasons for
not commencing radiotherapy were death (n ¼ 19),
patient decision (n ¼ 17), disease progression or deterioration in the patient’s condition (n ¼ 8), and other reasons (n ¼ 8). The reasons for not completing
radiotherapy were patient’s death (n ¼ 13), disease progression or deterioration in the patient’s condition (n ¼
30), treatment toxicity (n ¼ 7), patient decision (n ¼ 4),
and other reasons (n ¼ 16).
Radiotherapy Intent and Dose
Among the 708 patients who had questionnaire data
and received radiotherapy, the objective of treatment
was palliative in 72%, curative in 21%, and adjuvant
in 7% (Table 3). Only 2 patients received neoadjuvant
radiotherapy. Among the patients with good performance status (ECOG 0-2), curative radiotherapy was
given to 76 out of the 230 patients (33%) with stage I
through III NSCLC and to 29 out of the 43 patients
(67%) with limited stage SCLC. The most common
sites of radiotherapy were the primary and/or regional
lymph node areas (n ¼ 414 patients; 58%), followed
by bone metastases (n ¼ 157 patients; 22%), and brain
metastases (n ¼ 120 patients; 17%) (Table 4).
The median dose of curative thoracic radiotherapy
was 60 grays (Gy) (interquartile range [IQR], 50-60 Gy)
for NSCLC and 50 Gy (IQR, 45-50 Gy) for SCLC. The
median dose for adjuvant thoracic radiotherapy for
NSCLC was 50 Gy (IQR, 45-54 Gy). For both pathologies, the median dose for palliative thoracic radiotherapy
was 30 Gy (IQR, 20-37.5 Gy). The median dose for palliative radiotherapy for both bone and brain metastases was
20 Gy in 5 fractions. The median dose for prophylactic
cranial irradiation was 30 Gy in 10 fractions.
The median time from diagnosis to radiotherapy
treatment was 29 days for patients who received radiotherapy only and 39 days for those who received combination
treatment. The median radiotherapy course duration was
14 days.

Factors Associated With Treatment Intent
Factors associated with the use of radiotherapy with curative intent were localized stage (vs extensive stage: adjusted
odds ratio [OR], 23.2; 95% confidence interval [CI],
13.9-38.5), weight loss (none vs some: OR, 2.9; 95% CI,
1.8-4.9), pathology (SCLC vs NSCLC: OR, 2.7; 95%
CI, 1.4-5.2), and ECOG performance status (good vs
poor: OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.4). There was no association with comorbidities, lung cancer specialist caseload,
sex, or age.
Chemoradiotherapy
Most patients with stage III NSCLC received palliative
radiotherapy. The reasons for this, as opposed to curative

690

intent radiotherapy, were not recorded. However, of the
52 patients with stage III NSCLC who received radiotherapy with curative intent, 65% (34 of 52 patients) received
chemotherapy. Because the chemotherapy was palliative
for 5 patients, only 56% (29 of 52 patients) received
chemotherapy as part of their curative treatment.
Of the 32 patients with limited stage SCLC who
received radiotherapy with curative intent (including adjuvant radiotherapy), 30 patients (94%) received chemotherapy, which was concurrent in 12 patients and
neoadjuvant in 18 patients. Six patients with limited stage
SCLC received palliative radiotherapy; thus, most
patients with SCLC who were given radiotherapy received
potentially curative chemoradiotherapy. However, there

patients who received chemotherapy and 21 patients who
received no treatment.17 Thus, of all patients with limited
stage SCLC, only 37% (30 of 81 patients) received chemoradiotherapy with curative intent. On the basis of clinical evaluation by radiation oncologists, 35 patients were
candidates for prophylactic cranial irradiation, which was
received by 23 patients.
Radiotherapy Utilization
The overall rate of radiotherapy utilization for patients
with lung cancer in the current study was 40% (727 of
1812 patients). This rate varied from 21% in patients

without pathologic confirmation to 36% and 43% for
patients with SCLC and NSCLC, respectively (Table 4).
Compared with optimal radiotherapy utilization rates,
there was less first use for treatment of disease in the chest
and more first use for disease at other sites, particularly
bone and brain; and there was less use with curative intent
and more use with palliative intent, particularly when it
was targeted to metastases (Table 4). For NSCLC, the
deficit in use lay mainly in stage III and IV disease; for
SCLC, the deficit was present in both limited stage and
extensive stage disease but proportionally was greatest in
limited stage disease (Table 4). These deficits were present
despite relatively high proportions of patients with good
performance status (ECOG 0-2): 74% overall, 78% in

87% and 62% in limited stage and extensive stage SCLC,
respectively.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first Australian study to
describe radiotherapy management of lung cancer at a
population level. Fifty-two percent of patients in our sample were referred to a radiation oncologist. Of these, 77%
(727 of 943 patients) received radiotherapy, and 69%
(651 of 943 patients; including 13 of the 19 patients with
no radiotherapy questionnaire) completed treatment in
full. The majority of referrals were patients who were
diagnosed with locoregional or advanced disease
(NSCLC/NPC stage III or IV and extensive disease
SCLC; 72%). Given this, a large proportion of patients
received radiotherapy with palliative intent (72%). However, of those who could have been treated with curative
intent (NSCLC stage I-III and limited stage SCLC), a significant proportion were not treated according to guideline recommendations.
Compared with optimal estimates of radiotherapy
utilization rates at initial diagnosis,13,14 significant gaps
were apparent in NSW. Overall, radiotherapy at initial diagnosis was underutilized by 29% according to Australian
standards13 and by 6% according to Canadian standards.14
Even if all patients who were referred to a radiation oncologist were treated using radiotherapy, the NSW underutilization rate would be 16% according to Australian
standards, suggesting a significant lack of consideration of
radiotherapy benefits by diagnosing and potentially treating clinicians or nihilistic attitudes about lung cancer. It is
well known that clinician attitudes and personal biases
affect treatment recommendations in lung cancer.23-25
An exploration of stage-specific radiotherapy utilization rates at initial diagnosis indicates that the proportions
of patients diagnosed with stage I or II NSCLC were
treated within acceptable ranges (stage I NSCLC: actual
rate, 27%; optimal rate, 27%-31%; stage II NSCLC:
actual rate, 39%; optimal rate, 31%-37%). However, significant gaps were observed for patients who were diagnosed with potentially curable disease. For stage III
NSCLC, 55% of patients received radiotherapy compared
with an ideal of from 77% to 81%. Furthermore, of the
patients with limited stage SCLC, only 46% were treated
(optimal range, 81%-94%). In this study, the majority of
these patients had a good performance status (83% and
87% of patients with stage III NSCLC and limited stage

692

SCLC, respectively). However, poor respiratory function
may have precluded curative radiotherapy, although this
generally would be reflected in a worse performance status. Large tumor volume also may have made the safe
delivery of curative radiotherapy difficult. Neither of these
factors was recorded in this study.
For patients who were diagnosed with stage IV
NSCLC and extensive spread of SCLC, optimal utilization rates varied between 35% to 83% and 11% to 49%,
respectively.13,14 For NSW, the actual rates for radiotherapy for these 2 stages were 49% and 32%, respectively.
The large variation within optimal utilization rates for
advanced stage lung cancer probably is because of the differences in the predicted prevalence of symptomatic disease in which radiotherapy can provide clinically
meaningful relief. In Australia, 71% of patients with stage
IV NSCLC are predicted to have symptomatic, local disease for which radiotherapy is recommended; in Canada,
this is estimated at 35%. For patients who are diagnosed
with extensive stage SCLC, the Australian optimum suggests that 49% of patients would have symptomatic disease and good ECOG status and, thus, likely would
benefit from receiving radiotherapy. In contrast, Canada’s
optimum rates are based on the small proportion of
patients who would respond to chemotherapy (7%) or
who have brain metastases at diagnosis (4.4%). One of
the limitations of the current study is the lack of data
regarding symptomatic presentation and response to
chemotherapy. Thus, the proportion of patients with
advanced disease who should have been treated is
unclear.
The Australian Lung Cancer Guidelines state that
the optimal treatment for stage III NSCLC (for nonsurgical patients) is combination chemoradiotherapy.8 In the
current study, only 38% of patients with stage III NSCLC
received concurrent chemotherapy with curative radiotherapy, and another 17% received sequential treatment.
For limited stage SCLC, the guidelines state that chemotherapy with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy is the optimal treatment. Although the majority of patients who
received radiotherapy also received chemotherapy, overall,
only 37% of patients with limited stage SCLC received
curative radiotherapy with chemotherapy. The Australian
guidelines were published after the current study, but the
evidence underlying the recommendations was published
in the 1990s, and further international guidelines were
available.26-28 Clearly, the use of combined modality
treatment is less than expected, and this deficit is more
marked in patients with limited stage SCLC. It is unlikely

that a significant proportion of patients were considered
fit for chemotherapy but not for radiotherapy.
It might be argued that the data are now 6 years old
and, thus, do not reflect current practice. The utilization
of radiotherapy in the current study, however, was less
than that recorded in Victoria in 1993 (44%) and in
South Western Sydney in 1996 (56%).16,29 Changes are
slow to occur in practice, as evidenced by the similar proportion of patients that did not receive any anticancer
treatment at all for their lung cancer in 1996 compared
with 2002.30 NSW is the most populous state in Australia
and has the greatest number of radiation oncology facilities. Therefore, the findings of this study are likely to be
applicable to the rest of Australia.
The findings of this study give cause for concern.
The utilization of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients in
NSW was less than the estimated optimum. The greatest
shortfall occurred in limited stage SCLC and stage III
NSCLC, diseases in which radiotherapy, in conjunction
with chemotherapy, has been proven to improve survival.
For patients who were referred for radiotherapy, curative
treatment was given infrequently, and the use of combined-modality treatment for appropriate patients was
uncommon. Although some of these findings may be
explained by factors like changing performance status,
inadequate respiratory function, or large tumor volume,
these are unlikely to account for all of the observed differences. In addition, patient refusal for treatment appeared
to be a minor factor. It is likely that attitudes of referring
physicians have an impact on referrals for radiotherapy
and, thus, radiotherapy utilization. The profile of radiotherapy for lung cancer needs to be raised, and the message
that radiotherapy can improve the survival and quality of
life of patients with lung cancer needs to be disseminated
to all those involved in the management of this disease.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
The Cancer Council New South Wales (NSW) funded the
study. The NSW Central Cancer Registry identified eligible
patients while it was operated under contract to the NSW
Department of Health at the Cancer Council NSW. It is now
operated by the Cancer Institute NSW. The analysis was funded
by the Cancer Institute NSW.
