BACKGROUND. The purpose was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of
thromboembolism associated with lenalidomide therapy in newly diagnosed
myeloma.

METHODS. A pooled analysis was performed of patients with previously untreated
multiple myeloma enrolled in clinical trials of lenalidomide-based therapy at the
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and the Italian Myeloma Network, Italy. The
incidence of thrombosis, the effect of risk factors such as steroid dose and erythropoietin supplementation, and the effect of prophylaxis were examined.

RESULTS. In all, 125 patients enrolled in 3 clinical trials were identified. Patients
were stratified based on the concomitant corticosteroid dose. Fifty-two patients
were in the high-dose group (dexamethasone 40 mg, 12 days a month); 73
patients were in the low-dose group (prednisone at any dose; or dexamethasone
40 mg, 4 days a month). A total of 110 patients were initiated on thromboprophylaxis; of these, 104 patients (95%) received aspirin. Ten patients (8%) developed
deep vein thrombosis, including 4 who were not receiving any thromboprophylaxis at the time of the event. The rate of thromboembolic events was not different between patients who received concomitant erythropoietin therapy and those
who did not, 4.8% and 8.6%, respectively (P 5 .54). A higher number of venous
thrombotic episodes occurred in the high-dose corticosteroid group compared
with the low-dose corticosteroid therapy group (12% vs 6%), but the difference
was not statistically significant (P 5 .3).

CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis is lower than previously

hromboembolic complications have been recognized for many
years in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).1 Various
mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increased risk,
including defective fibrin structure and fibrinolysis due to increased
immunoglobulin levels, the presence of autoantibodies like lupus
anticoagulant, increased rates of acquired activated protein C resistance (aAPCR), and increased synthesis of inflammatory markers like
interleukin (IL)-6.2,3 However, despite these procoagulant effects the
incidence of thrombosis in myeloma was historically lower when
compared with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or lung. It was only
after thalidomide was introduced in the late 1990s that the venous
thromboembolic complications in MM gained prominence.4,5
Thalidomide monotherapy is associated with low rates of
thrombosis, but the risk rises dramatically when the drug is combined with corticosteroids. In newly diagnosed myeloma the combi-

nation of thalidomide plus dexamethasone (Thal/
Dex) has a high response rate of approximately 65%
to 70% but is associated with a thrombosis risk of
17% to 26% in the absence of routine thromboprophylaxis.6,7 In patients with recurring myeloma the
incidence of deep vein thrombosis with Thal/Dex is
elevated, but lower (8%) compared with patients
with newly diagnosed disease.8 The thrombotic episodes associated with thalidomide tend to occur in
the first few months of therapy and are not correlated with age or response to therapy.4,5 The high
rates of thrombosis remain unexplained and endothelial damage may play a role.
Lenalidomide is a more potent immunomodulatory derivative of thalidomide with a favorable sideeffect profile.9–11 However, it appears that thrombotic
risk is significant with lenalidomide-based regimens
as well. Similar to thalidomide, thrombotic complications seem to be increased primarily when the agent
is combined with corticosteroids or other chemotherapeutic agents.12 Another potential risk factor is the
use of erythropoietic agents.13 Several different
thromboprophylaxis strategies have been effective in
lowering the risk of thrombosis: aspirin (81–325 mg/
day), full-intensity warfarin (INR 2–3), and prophylactic enoxaparin (40 mg subcutaneous daily). However, none of these preventive strategies have been
tested prospectively, so the choice often reflects physician and/or patient preferences.12,14–16
Although lenalidomide was approved by the
Food and Drug administration (FDA) in July 2006,
the incidence of deep vein thrombosis with this
agent and the associated risk factors have not been
well studied. The purpose of this article is to describe
the incidence of deep vein thrombosis with lenalidomide therapy and assess the associated risk factors
and efficacy of aspirin thromboprophylaxis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After approval from the respective Institutional
Review Boards, a pooled analysis of newly diagnosed
MM patients enrolled in lenalidomide clinical trials
was performed jointly by the investigators in Italy
and at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
Data regarding the rate of venous and arterial thrombotic events were obtained by review of medical
records and existing databases. Serious thromboembolic events, specifically deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism, were
reviewed and recorded. All clinical events were
symptomatic and objectively diagnosed and confirmed by radiologic studies like ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan

1523

during the treatment with lenalidomide or within 1
month of discontinuing the drug. In addition, various
patient characteristics such as age, sex, performance
status, previous history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, and
disease status were assessed. We also examined
whether aspirin prophylaxis and erythropoietin use
influenced the thrombosis risk. The primary objective was to ascertain the rate of thrombotic episodes
with lenalidomide-based therapy for newly diagnosed myeloma and to evaluate whether there is a
higher risk of thrombosis in the high-dose steroid
group.
Statistical analysis was done with Stat-View v.
5.01 (Cary, NC). All analyses were on an intent-totreat principle. The chi-square and Fisher exact test
were used to compare differences in nominal variables; the rank sum test was used for continuous
variables.

RESULTS
Trial and Patient Characteristics
Three eligible trials were identified (Table 1). A total
of 125 patients were analyzed (70 males and 55
females). The median age was 67.3 years (range,
32.7–72.3 years). In all, 110 patients (88%) received
deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis (Table 2). Aspirin
was the most common form of prophylaxis and was
instituted in 104 patients. Five patients received coumadin and 1 was on low molecular weight heparin.
Twenty-one patients (17%) were on erythropoietin
supplementation.
Patients were stratified based on the concomitant corticosteroid dose to a high-dose and low-dose
group. There were 52 patients in the high-dose
group, receiving dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4
days on Days 1–4, 9–12, and 17–20 of a 28-day cycle.
The low-dose steroid group had 73 patients: 53 were
on prednisone as per the melphalan, prednisone,
and lenalidomide (MPR) regimen; 20 were on dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28day cycle (Table 1).
Incidence and Risk Factors for Venous Thrombotic Events
Ten patients developed venous thrombotic events for
an overall rate of 8%. The median age of patients
who developed deep vein thrombosis was 69.3 years
(range, 63.6–78.2 years). In patients who did not have
a thromboembolic event the median age was 67.3
years (range, 32.7–78.3 years). The characteristics of
patients who developed deep vein thrombosis are
listed in Table 3. Six patients developed an extremity
deep vein thrombosis and 4 patients had pulmonary

embolism. There were no fatalities from these
thrombotic events.
Eight of 110 patients (7.3%) who received thromboprophylaxis developed deep vein thrombosis, compared with 2 of 15 patients (13.3%) who did not
receive any thromboprophylaxis (P 5 .04). However,
not all patients who were initiated on thromboprophylaxis remained on such treatment at the time of
deep vein thrombosis. On the basis of review of the
records, 2 of the estimated 10 patients (20%) who
had stopped thromboprophylaxis developed deep
vein thrombosis; thus, 6 of the remaining 100
patients (6%) who received continuous uninterrupted
thromboprophylaxis developed thrombosis.

There was a higher rate of deep vein thrombosis
in the high-dose corticosteroid group compared with
the low-dose corticosteroid group (12% vs 6%), but
this difference was not statistically significant, P 5 .3
(Table 2). Twenty-one patients (17%) received concurrent erythropoietin therapy. There was no effect
of erythropoietin use on the incidence of deep vein
thrombosis in this study, 4.8% (with erythropoietin)
versus 8.6% (no erythropoietin) (P 5 .5). Male sex
was associated with a 2-fold increase in thrombosis
risk, but the increase was not statistically significant.
There were no venous thrombotic events in patients
younger than 60 years. The occurrence of venous
thrombotic events did not affect overall survival. The

overall survival of all patients in this study is shown
in Figure 1.
The timing of deep vein thrombosis with respect
to lenalidomide treatment is shown in Table 3. In 6
patients (60%), thrombotic events occurred between
the third and sixth cycle of treatment. Among the 4
patients whose thrombotic event did not occur
within this time frame, 3 had possible contributing
factors. In 2 patients in the MPR arm aspirin had
been discontinued: 1 of them developed deep vein
thrombosis in the seventh cycle of therapy and the
other during maintenance. One patient in the highdose steroid arm developed a pulmonary embolus in
the sixteenth cycle of his treatment. He had recently
switched from therapeutic coumadin to aspirin. One
patient in the MPR arm developed a pulmonary
embolus within the first cycle of treatment and had
no known risk factors.
Arterial thrombosis was uncommon, with 3
reported myocardial infarctions and no episodes of
stroke. Of this, only 1 event was thought to be related
to the study drug. This patient developed myocardial
infarction within a week of starting lenalidomide and
high-dose dexamethasone. On coronary catheterization he was found to have extensive lesions in the
right coronary artery, which was stented. There were
underlying risk factors including hypertension, obesity, and previous smoking. Lenalidomide was discontinued.

mechanisms remain unclear. We performed a pooled
analysis of newly diagnosed myeloma patients
receiving lenalidomide as initial therapy and report a
cumulative deep vein thrombosis rate of 8%. This
rate is in the lower range of what has been previously reported in the literature in this setting (Table
4). The lower rate may be related to the high percentage of our patient population (88%) who
received anticoagulant prophylaxis. In addition, 58%
of patients studied were on low-dose steroids,
namely, weekly dexamethasone, or prednisone. The
thrombotic rate in patients receiving low-dose corticosteroids in this study was 6%. In contrast, the
thrombotic rate in patients on high-dose corticosteroids was 12% (P 5 .4). The difference in incidence
of thrombosis based on the dose of corticosteroids
did not achieve statistical significance, probably due
to the low event rate and the relatively small sample
size of this study. However, these data are consistent
with a prior report in which the thrombosis risk with
lenalidomide was significantly associated with steroid dose.17
Erythropoietin is thought to increase the risk of
deep vein thrombosis with lenalidomide therapy.
When 2 large randomized trials involving recurring
refractory myeloma patients was compared, it was
found that the thrombosis rate of 8.5% reported by
Dimopoulos et al.18 in 176 patients in Europe, Israel,
and Australia was lower than the 15% reported by

Weber et al.27 in a similar group of patients in the
US and Canada. Both groups had received the same
dose of dexamethasone and lenalidomide, but more
patients in the North American study received concomitant erythropoietin. On multivariate analysis,
the use of erythropoietin was found to be a significant risk factor for thrombosis in the North American Study.13 In our study, only 17% of patients were
on erythropoietin, and no association was seen
between erythropoietin use and deep vein thrombosis. The risk of deep vein thrombosis was 4.8% in
patients who received concomitant erythropoietin,
and 8.6% in those who did not receive any erythropoietin. The high frequency of anticoagulant prophylaxis as well as the low dose steroids used in
combination with lenalidomide may have reduced
the thrombotic risk associated with erythropoietin
usage.
It is well established that aspirin is effective in
reducing the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke,
but its role in reducing venous thrombosis is controversial.19 In a large study (the Pulmonary Embolism
Prevention trial) involving more than 17,000 orthopedic patients, it was noted that aspirin significantly
reduced the risk of venous thromboembolism compared with the placebo arm.20 There was some criticism regarding the study endpoints.21 Nevertheless,
review of available evidence seems to suggest that
platelets are involved in venous thrombus formation,

Lenalidomide-Based Therapy for MM/Menon et al.

and inhibiting the platelet function with aspirin may
be of some benefit in reducing the risk of venous
thrombosis.22 Currently, aspirin is not recommended
for prophylaxis against venous thrombosis23 because
we have more effective agents.
There are some data that aspirin has been beneficial in reducing the risk of deep vein thrombosis in
the context of thalidomide or lenalidomide therapy.
In 1 study, when aspirin was added to the regimen of
DVd-T (liposomal doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, and thalidomide) there was a significant
reduction in the risk of deep vein thrombosis.24 In a
Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) study of newly
diagnosed myeloma,25 9 of the first 12 patients enrolled (75%) developed thromboembolic complications. Subsequently, after institution of aspirin
prophylaxis the cumulative thrombotic rate in the
study was reduced significantly, although the rate
was still high, at 19%. In our cohort of patients the
rate of thrombosis in patients on aspirin prophylaxis
was approximately 7%, compared with 13% without
prophylaxis.
Arterial thrombosis is uncommon with lenalidomide. The 1 patient who had a myocardial infarction
attributed to lenalidomide had major risk factors for
coronary disease. In more than half of the patients
thrombosis occurred between the third and sixth
month. This could have been affected by the finding
that patients may have completed therapy within the
first 6 months. In the 3 patients whose thrombotic
event occurred after the sixth month, anticoagulant
prophylaxis was either discontinued or modified.
The thrombosis rate with lenalidomide and
high-dose corticosteroids was 12% in our study, and
approximately 20% in other studies (Table 4). Given
this rate, prophylaxis with low molecular weight
heparin or therapeutic-dose coumadin rather than
aspirin is required in such patients. Preliminary
data suggest that overall survival with high-dose
steroids is inferior to low-dose steroids in newly
diagnosed patients receiving lenalidomide-based
therapy.26 Hence, this regimen may be less widely
used in the future. In contrast to lenalidomide plus
high-dose corticosteroids, based on our study and a
review of other trials, it appears that the rate of
deep vein thrombosis with lenalidomide and lowdose steroid therapy is approximately 5% to 8%
with aspirin prophylaxis. Regardless of whether
there is a true protective effect or not, the low overall rate of thrombotic events strongly argues in
favor of routine aspirin prophylaxis with lenalidomide and low-dose corticosteroid-containing regimens, and negates the need for routine full-dose
anticoagulation in this setting.
