Abstract
The metabolic sensor mTOR broadly regulates cell growth and
division in cancer cells, leading to a signiﬁcant focus on studies
of rapamycin and its analogues as candidate anticancer drugs.
However, mTOR inhibitors have failed to produce useful clinical
efﬁcacy, potentially because mTOR is also critical in T cells
implicated in immunosurveillance. Indeed, recent studies using
rapamycin have demonstrated the important role of mTOR in
differentiation and induction of the CD8þ memory in T-cell
responses associated with antitumor properties. In this study, we
demonstrate that rapamycin harms antitumor immune responses
mediated by T cells in the setting of cancer vaccine therapy.
Speciﬁcally, we analyzed how rapamycin affects the antitumor

Introduction
mTOR is a key kinase that regulates broad aspects of cellular
functions (metabolism, protein synthesis, cell growth, proliferation, survival, apoptosis, autophagy; refs. 1, 2) in response
to environmental signals, including growth factors, cytokines,
and oxygen (3). Growing evidence implicated mTOR signaling
pathways in numerous diseases, including cancer (1). Indeed,
mTOR pathways are highly activated in various types of cancer
such as laryngeal, cervical, hepatocellular and renal cell carcinomas (RCC), and gastric, colorectal, prostate, and breast
cancers (4–6). These observations have urged preclinical studies and clinical trials to use rapamycin or its analogues to
inhibit mTOR activation as an anticancer therapy. Preclinical
studies gave promising results (7), and numerous clinical trials
are currently ongoing. In 2007 and 2009, the FDA approved the
use of rapamycin and two of its analogues (temsirolimus and
everolimus) for the treatment of advanced RCC (8, 9). How1

efﬁcacy of a human papilloma virus E7 peptide vaccine (CyaA-E7)
capable of eradicating tumors in the TC-1 mouse model of cervical
cancer. In animals vaccinated with CyaA-E7, rapamycin administration completely abolished recruitment of CD8þ T cells into
TC-1 tumors along with the ability of the vaccine to reduce
inﬁltration of T regulatory cells and myeloid-derived suppressor
cells. Moreover, rapamycin completely abolished vaccineinduced cytotoxic T-cell responses and therapeutic activity. Taken
together, our results demonstrate the powerful effects of mTOR
inhibition in abolishing T-cell–mediated antitumor immune
responses essential for the therapeutic efﬁcacy of cancer vaccines.

ever, clinical studies gave modest overall clinical results, leading to disease stabilization rather than tumor regression (5, 10),
thus prompting its combination with chemotherapies (7) or
immunotherapies. This is due to the fact that mTOR is also a
central regulator of the immune system (11), particularly in the
differentiation of T cells. mTOR controls, indeed, the differentiation of na€ve CD4þ T cells into TH1, TH2, or TH17 (12, 13)
and na€ve CD8þ T cells into effector cells (14). Araki and
colleagues have shown that treatment with rapamycin during
acute infection with LCMV enhanced the virus-speciﬁc CD8þ T
cells and favored the CD8þ memory response in mice and
macaques (14). Other studies demonstrated the beneﬁcial
effect of rapamycin treatment on the vaccine-induced antitumoral response in mice (15) and the vaccine-induced antiviral
responses in macaques (16).
Human papilloma viruses (HPV) cause proliferative lesions
in infected skin and squamous mucosa, resulting in hyperplasias, papillomas, and condylomas. Most HPV infections are
transient, but in some patients, persistent mucosal lesions due
to high-risk HPVs, particularly in the anogenital tract and the
oropharynx, can progress into in situ or invasive carcinomas
(17), making cervical carcinoma the second most frequent
gynecologic cancer in women.
Our team has developed a new vaccine candidate, the CyaA
vector carrying the E7 oncoprotein from HPV-16, currently under
clinical trials and able to induce complete tumor eradication in a
mouse model of HPV-related carcinoma (18), although its therapeutic efﬁcacy against large tumors is strongly reduced. However,
combining the CyaA-E7 vaccine with different adjuvants, such as
CpG-B, strongly enhances the regression of large tumors but still
does not induce complete eradication (19).

Therefore, strategies to enhance the therapeutic efﬁcacy of the
vaccine-induced immune response against large tumors are still
needed. The recent data showing the capacity of rapamycin to
promote memory CD8þ T-cell responses (14, 15) suggested that
rapamycin may enhance the CyaA-E7 vaccine–induced tumorspeciﬁc CD8þ T-cell responses and tumor regression. To address
this issue, tumor-bearing mice were vaccinated with CyaA-E7
and received chronic or short-course rapamycin treatments. We
evaluated the tumor growth, T-cell responses, and the recruitment of lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC) to the tumor site. Surprisingly, we observed that
rapamycin treatment induces a strong, dose-dependent inhibition of the vaccine-induced cytotoxic CD8þ T-cell recruitment to
the tumor site and reduction in T regulatory cell (Treg) inﬁltration and an overall decrease in tumor control. This study
strongly supports the conclusion that in our model, treatment
with rapamycin is detrimental to the induction of antitumoral
immune responses. Our data could explain the low efﬁcacy of
rapamycin in patients with cancer, and thus the inﬂuence of
mTOR inhibitors on antitumor immunity deserves careful
investigation both in experimental models and in patients.

Materials and Methods
Mice and tumors
Speciﬁc pathogen-free 6-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were
purchased from Charles River and were kept in the Pasteur
Institute (Paris, France) animal facilities under pathogen-free
conditions with water and food ad libitum. All the in vivo experiments were carried out in compliance with French and European
laws and regulations.
TC-1 tumor cells expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 proteins (20)
and that were derived from primary mouse lung epithelial cells
were obtained from the ATCC LGC (Promochem). TC-1 cells were
injected subcutaneously into the shaved left ﬂank of C57BL/6
mice (6  105 TC-1 cells per mouse). The tumor size represents the
average of two perpendicular diameters (millimeters) and was
measured with a digital caliper (Mitutoyo).
Reagents
The synthetic peptide E749–57 RAHYNIVTF, corresponding to
the HPV16-E7 H2Db-restricted epitope (21) was purchased
from Polypeptide. The detoxiﬁed CyaA of Bordetella pertussis
carrying a truncated form of the E7 protein (CyaA-E7) was
prepared as previously described (18, 19). CpG-B 1826 (50 TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-30 ) was synthesized by Proligo
and mixed with 60 mg N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxyl)propyl]-NNNtrimethylammoniummethyl sulfate (DOTAP; Roche). Rapamycin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.; 750 or 75 mg/kg/d) in a total volume of 150 mL
(vs. PBS in control mice), for 14 or 22 days, depending on the
experimental protocol.
Cell isolation
Peripheral lymph nodes from na€ve mice (N; maxillary, axillary,
and inguinal) or inguinal tumor-draining lymph nodes were
harvested, mechanically disrupted, and ﬁltered to obtain single-cell suspensions. Spleens from both na€ve (Sp N) and
tumor-bearing mice (Sp T) were harvested, treated for 20 minutes
with 400 U/mL collagenase D and 50 mg/mL DNase I (Boehringer

3280 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

Mannheim), mechanically disrupted, and ﬁltered to obtain single-cell suspensions. The tumors were harvested and dissociated
using the gentleMACS dissociator (program mTumor-01). The
tumors were then incubated for 45 minutes with 400 U/mL
collagenase D and 50 mg/mL DNase I and ﬁltered to obtain
single-cell suspensions.
Flow cytometry analysis
The following monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were used: APCor APCeF780-conjugated anti-CD3e (clone 145-2C11), paciﬁc
blue–conjugated anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5) and PerCPCy5.5–conjugated anti-CD8a (clone 53-6.7), together with APC-conjugated
anti-CD44 (clone IM7), anti-CD45RB (clone C363.16A),
APCeF780-conjugated CD45.2 (clone 104), PE-Cy7-conjugated
anti-CD19 (clone 6D5), anti-CD62L (clone: MEL-14), anti-CD69
(clone HI.2F), PE-conjugated anti-CD39 (clone 24DMS1), antiCD73 (clone TY/11.8), anti-GITR (clone DTA-1), and anti-PD-1
(clone J43). For MDSC staining, we used PerCPCy5.5-conjugated
anti-CD49b (cloneDX5), biotin-conjugated anti-F4/80 (clone
BM8) followed by BV605-conjugated streptavidin, eF450-conjugated anti-CD11c (clone N418), together with a cocktail mix of
mAbs from eBiolegend [PE-conjugated anti-CD11b (clone M1/
70), and APC-conjugated anti-Gr1 (clone RB6-8C5)]. These
mAbs were purchased from BD Pharmingen or eBioscience.
PE-conjugated H-2Db/E749-57 tetramers were obtained from
MBL International Corporation. The paciﬁc orange–coupled
LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen, molecular probes) was used to stain dead cells, according to the
manufacturer's protocol before ﬁxing cells for intracellular staining. Foxp3þ cells were detected by intracellular staining with
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-Foxp3 mAb
(FJK-16), according to the manufacturer's protocol (eBioscience).
The cells were acquired on a CyAn (Coultronics)) or LSRFortessa
(BD) ﬂow cytometers and analyzed with the FlowJo software
(Tree Star).
In vivo killing assay
For cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) priming, the mice were
intravenously immunized with the CyaA-E7 (50 mg/mouse)
together with CpG-B-DOTAP (30 and 60 mg/mouse, respectively).
Seven days after immunization, na€ve syngeneic splenocytes were
pulsed with the E749–57 peptide (30 mg/mL, 30 minutes, 37 C),
washed extensively, and labeled with a high concentration
(2.5 mmol/L) of carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE;
Molecular Probes). The nonpulsed control population was
labeled with a low concentration (0.45 mmol/L) of CFSE.
CFSEhigh- and CFSElow-labeled cells were mixed in a 1:1 ratio
(5  106 cells of each population) and intravenously injected
into mice. Spleen cells were collected 20 to 24 hours later and
washed and resuspended in FACS buffer. The number of CFSEpositive cells remaining in the spleen after 20 to 24 hours was
determined by FACS. The percentage of speciﬁc lysis was calculated as follows: % speciﬁc lysis ¼ 100  [100  (% CFSEhigh
immunized mice/% CFSElow immunized mice)/(% CFSEhigh
na€ve mouse/% CFSElow na€ve mouse)].
IFNg ELISPOT assays
Mice were intravenously immunized with the CyaA-E7 and
CpG-B-DOTAP as described above. Eight days after immunization, cells were stimulated in vitro for the production of IFNg.

Rapamycin Impedes Vaccine-Induced Tumor Rejection

Brieﬂy, multiscreen ﬁltration plates (96 wells; Millipore) were
precoated with the anti-mouse IFNg capture antibody (IFNg
ELISpot pair, Diaclone) overnight at 4 C. Then the plates were
washed and blocked with complete medium containing 10%
FCS. Eight days after immunization, 106 spleen cells were isolated
from the mice, added to the wells, and incubated for 18 hours
with or without the E749–57 peptide (30 mg/mL; 37 C). The plates
were revealed by incubation with the biotinylated anti-mouse
IFNg detection antibody (IFNg ELISpot pair, Diaclone) for
90 minutes at 37 C, followed by incubation with streptavidin
alkaline phosphatase (BD, Pharmingen; 1 hour, 37 C). Finally,
spots were revealed using the ready-to-use BCIP/NBT substrate
(Sigma-Aldrich). The number of IFNg-producing cells was determined by counting the number of spot-forming cells in each well
(Bioreader 5000), and the results were calculated as follows: total
number of spot-forming cells after stimulation with E7  number
of spot-forming cells without stimulation for each mouse and
expressed as number of spot-forming cells/106.
Statistical analysis
Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used to calculate
the statistical signiﬁcance for the differences in the particular
measurements between the groups. Two-tailed unpaired tests
(Mann–Whitney test) and the Mantel–Cox log-rank test were
used; P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Chronic treatment with rapamycin inhibits CyaA-E7 vaccine–
induced tumor regression
To evaluate the impact of rapamycin treatment on the tumor
growth and immune response after the tumor graft and therapeutic vaccination, TC-1 tumor–bearing mice were vaccinated
with CyaA-E7 adjuvanted with CpG-B on day 14 after the tumor
graft, alone or in combination with rapamycin treatments. We ﬁrst
used a high dose of rapamycin (750 mg/kg/d; daily i.p. injections),
either from days 0 to 22 or from days 14 to 22 after the tumor graft.
As previously shown (19), CyaA-E7 and CpG induced full tumor
eradication in 42% of the vaccinated mice and signiﬁcantly
enhanced their survival (Fig. 1A and B). Given alone, both chronic
and short-term rapamycin treatments slightly delayed the tumor
growth and signiﬁcantly enhanced the survival of nonvaccinated
mice (Fig. 1A and B). However, when given in combination with
CyaA-E7 vaccination, the rapamycin treatment completely abrogated the therapeutic effect of CyaA-E7 on tumor growth. Indeed,
no tumor regression was observed in vaccinated mice after either
regimen of rapamycin. These data clearly show that high dose
rapamycin treatments fully abrogate vaccine-induced tumor
regression.
Treatment with rapamycin inhibits lymphocyte recruitment
to tumor-draining lymph nodes and the tumor site and
abrogates the therapeutic effect of CyaA-E7
We have previously shown that CyaA-E7 with CpG-B induces
antigen (Ag)-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells as soon as 7 days after vaccination (19). Because the rapamycin treatment completely abrogated the vaccine's effect on tumor growth, we analyzed its impact
on the T-cell compartment in lymphoid tissues and tumors (the
FACS gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1).
Increased numbers of total and CD45þ cells were observed in
tumor-draining lymph nodes, but these numbers were dramati-

cally reduced in mice receiving chronic rapamycin treatments,
with or without vaccination. The short-term rapamycin treatment
only slightly reduced the cell numbers in the draining lymph
nodes (Fig. 2A). The rapamycin treatments did not induce any
changes in T- and B-cell percentages compared with the untreated
tumor-bearing mice. Although vaccination by CyaA-E7 and CpG
increased the numbers of total cells and total CD45þ cells in the
spleen, chronic rapamycin treatment reduced the cell numbers
when given alone and completely inhibited the vaccine's effect
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). However, the rapamycin treatments
did not change the B- and T-cell percentages in the spleen.
Increased numbers of CD45þ tumor-inﬁltrating cells were
detected in vaccinated untreated mice (Fig. 2B, top left). However, a massive reduction in the total cell numbers (Supplementary Fig. S2C), CD45þ tumor-inﬁltrating cells and of all
lymphocyte subsets (Fig. 2B) was observed after the chronic
rapamycin treatment (days 0–22; with or without vaccination),
whereas the short-term rapamycin treatment (days 14–22)
reduced only the number of total cells and of CD45þ tumorinﬁltrating cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C and Fig. 2B). The
CyaA-E7 vaccination increased both the CD8þ T-cell and CD4þ
Foxp3 T effector cell (Teff) recruitment to the tumor site while
reducing the CD4þ Foxp3þ Treg accumulation, demonstrating
the ability of this vaccine to induce a more effective antitumoral
response. In contrast, both the chronic and short-course rapamycin treatments dramatically inhibited the CD8þ T-cell and
Teff recruitment to tumors in nonvaccinated mice (Fig. 2B). This
inhibition by rapamycin was even greater in the vaccinated
mice. Both rapamycin treatments also inhibited the reduction
of Treg inﬁltration in tumors that was observed after CyaA-E7
vaccination. These results show that high doses of rapamycin
impede lymphocyte recruitment to tumor draining lymph
nodes as well as the CD8þ T-cell and CD4þ Teff recruitment
to the tumor site. They also demonstrate that rapamycin inhibits both the tumor- and vaccine-induced recruitment of CD8þ
T cells to the tumor site.
We also analyzed the effect of rapamycin on the recruitment of
MDSC, a population of immature myeloid cells that were shown
to accumulate in lymphoid tissues of tumor-bearing mice and in
the blood of patients with cancer (22). We found that the numbers
and percentages of MDSC (the gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3) were increased in the spleen (Fig. 3A) and
lymph nodes (Fig. 3B) from tumor-bearing mice and that CyaAE7 increased their recruitment, particularly in the spleen. However, both rapamycin treatments strongly inhibited their accumulation (Fig. 3A and B, left). In contrast, although CyaA-E7 reduced
the accumulation of MDSC in the tumor, rapamycin completely
inhibited its effect (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the short treatment also
reversed the inhibition of CyaA-E7 and enhanced MDSC recruitment to tumor site.
These observations clearly show that rapamycin not only
inhibited the recruitment of CD8þ T cells and CD4þ Teffs to the
tumor site but also enhanced the accumulation of MDSC known
to inhibit the cytotoxic CD8þ T-cell response (23), thus favoring
the escape from antitumor immune responses.
Rapamycin inhibits the vaccine-induced reduced activation of
tumor-inﬁltrating Tregs
Araki and colleagues showed that chronic rapamycin treatment increases the expression of CD62L and other memory
T-cell markers (14). Therefore, we analyzed the changes in the

CD8þ T cells in the spleen, whereas the short-term treatment
increased this expression only in vaccinated mice (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Overall, these results suggest that the rapamycin treatments did not enhance the memory phenotype of CD8þ T cells in
lymphoid tissues in our model but rather reduced their activation
as assessed by CD44 expression.
We have previously shown that tumor-inﬁltrating CD4þ
T cells, especially Tregs, are highly activated with a signiﬁcantly
increased expression of CD44, CD69, and PD-1 (an inducer of
T-cell tolerance and a marker for T-cell exhaustion; ref. 24)
compared with draining lymph nodes or spleen Tregs (25), they
lose CD62L expression and acquire an effector/memory phenotype (CD44high CD62L). Similar results were obtained
here for tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ T cells with an increased CD44
and PD-1 expression (Fig. 4C and D) and decreased CD62L

expression (Supplementary Fig. S4C) compared with lymphoid
organs (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), demonstrating their
strong activation and effector/memory phenotype.
CyaA-E7 vaccination had no effect on the phenotype of
tumor-inﬁltrating CD4þ Teffs and CD8þ T cells (Supplementary
Figs. S5A and S4C, respectively) but signiﬁcantly reduced CD44
expression and increased GITR expression on Tregs (Fig. 4A and
B). Because GITR is a costimulatory molecule for Teffs and an
inhibitor of Treg suppressor activity (26), CyaA-E7 vaccination
seems to also reduce the suppressive function of Tregs. Vaccination with CyaA-E7 did not impact the other markers on tumorinﬁltrating T cells (Supplementary Figs. S4C and S5).
In addition, the chronic rapamycin treatment increased the
expression of CD73 on tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ T cells and Teffs in
nonvaccinated mice (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary Fig. S5A,

CD4þ Teffs (Supplementary Fig. S5A) or CD8þ T cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Taken together, these results indicate that CyaA-E7 vaccination
activated the CD8þ T-cell responses and dampened the suppressive function of Tregs in tumors. Moreover, both rapamycin
treatments inhibited these effects and increased the expression
of suppressive molecules on tumor-inﬁltrating effector CD4þ and
CD8þ T cells.
Low-dose rapamycin treatment impedes lymphocyte
recruitment to the tumor site and tumor-draining lymph nodes
In contrast to previous studies (14, 15, 27), our results show
that treatment with a high dose of rapamycin (750 mg/kg/d) is
detrimental for T-cell responses and tumor regression in our
model. Li and colleagues have demonstrated that short-term
low-dose rapamycin treatments (75 mg/kg/d) increased the Agspeciﬁc CD8þ T-cell early response (15). We therefore analyzed
whether a lower dose of rapamycin would have a positive impact
on the CyaA-E7 vaccine–induced T-cell responses. On day 22 after
tumor graft, both the short-term and chronic treatments of
rapamycin at low dose decreased the numbers of total and
CD45þ cells (but not the percentages of lymphocytes) in the
spleen, draining lymph nodes, and tumors and inhibited the
CyaA-E7–induced recruitment (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6C).
The chronic rapamycin treatment strongly reduced the increased
percentage of CD8þ T cells and CD4þ Teffs that were observed in
tumor-bearing mice vaccinated with CyaA-E7 (Supplementary
Fig. S6C). Rapamycin also reduced the percentage of CD4þ T
within the CD45þ cells without affecting the proportions of Tregs
and CD4þ Teffs. In contrast, the short-term rapamycin treatment
had a weaker effect on the inﬁltration of total CD4þ or CD8þ T
cells (Supplementary Fig. S6C). These data show that although the
low-dose rapamycin treatments had a reduced inhibitory effect on
tumor-inﬁltrating T cells compared with high dose, they had no
beneﬁcial impact on CD8þ T-cell inﬁltration and increased the
expression of CD44 and PD-1 on tumor-inﬁltrating Tregs (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Despite a slight but nonsigniﬁcant increase in the expression of
CD62L on the draining lymph node CD8þ T cells (Supplementary
Fig. S8), the low-dose rapamycin treatment weakly impacted the
activation status of tumor-inﬁltrating CD4þ Teffs (Supplementary
Fig. S7A) and CD8þ T cells in the tumors and lymphoid tissues
(Supplementary Figs. S7C and S8, respectively), conﬁrming the
overall observations made with the high-dose rapamycin
treatments.
Low-dose rapamycin treatments inhibit the therapeutic effect of
CyaA-E7 vaccination on tumor regression
We then determined whether the low-dose rapamycin treatment was beneﬁcial for tumor growth control. However, it had no
signiﬁcant effect on the growth of TC-1 tumors in nonvaccinated
mice but strongly inhibited the CyaA-E7–induced tumor regression (Fig. 5A). In the chronically treated group, only 17% of the
mice rejected their tumor versus 50% in the untreated mice. Both
rapamycin regimens also signiﬁcantly reduced the vaccineinduced enhanced survival (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results
clearly show that even low-dose rapamycin treatment negatively
regulates the T-cell inﬁltration and response to tumor. Given these
results and according to the data from Li and colleagues who
showed that an early 7-day treatment with a high dose of rapa-

3286 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

mycin strongly enhances the antitumor CD8 T-cell memory
response and tumor regression (15), we also tested the effect of
a short treatment with rapamycin from days 0 to 7 after TC-1 graft
on the tumor growth in vaccinated and nonvaccinated mice. This
short, early treatment with either high or low dose of rapamycin
had no effect on the CyaA-E7–induced tumor regression (Supplementary Fig. S9), suggesting that the effect of the treatment
with rapamycin from days 0 to 7 does not last long enough to
impact the therapeutic activity of the CyaA-E7 vaccine given on
day 14.
Rapamycin inhibits the antigen-speciﬁc CTL responses in a
dose-dependent manner
In contrast to previous studies (14, 15, 27), our results show
that long and short rapamycin treatments have detrimental effects
on tumor control and vaccine-induced antitumoral responses. We
therefore determined whether rapamycin also has an effect on the
induction of Ag-speciﬁc cytotoxic T-cell responses in vivo. Mice
were immunized on day 0 with CyaA-E7/CpG-B and received
daily injections of rapamycin (75 or 750 mg/kg/d) from day 1
until day 7. The induction of CTL responses and IFNg-producing
cells was assayed on day 8 by in vivo killing and ELISPOT assays,
respectively (Fig. 6A and B). The CyaA-E7 vaccine induced a
signiﬁcant killing of E7-loaded targets that was strongly inhibited
by both doses of rapamycin (Fig. 6A). Rapamycin also reduced the
numbers of IFNg-producing cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 6B). We also analyzed the numbers of E7-speciﬁc CD8þ T
cells in the spleen 7 days after immunization. As expected, CyaAE7 vaccination induced E7-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell responses (19),
and rapamycin treatments signiﬁcantly reduced them in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 6C). We also analyzed the effect of
rapamycin on OVA-speciﬁc CTL responses and found a similar
dose-dependent inhibition of the antigen-speciﬁc CTL response
after vaccination with OVA/CpG (Supplementary Fig. S10).
Because Araki and colleagues showed that rapamycin favors
memory CD8þ T-cell responses after vaccination (14), we assayed
the CD8 T-cell response 25 days after immunization and found
inhibitory effects of rapamycin treatment on CTL responses and
on the number of IFNg-producing cells, consistent with our
results on day 8 (Fig. 6D and E). In contrast, the effect of
rapamycin treatments on the percentages of E7-speciﬁc CD8þ T
cells was not signiﬁcant on day 25 (Fig. 6F). These data demonstrate that rapamycin inhibits the induction of Ag-speciﬁc cytotoxic CD8þ T-cell responses and seem to have a long-term effect
on CTL function but not on the numbers of Ag-speciﬁc CD8þ T
cells.

Discussion
Chemotherapeutic agents are widely used for cancer treatment
alone or in combination with other treatments. In addition to
their well-known beneﬁcial effect against tumors, some chemotherapeutics impact the immune system. Cyclophosphamide
induces the type-I IFN-associated inﬂammatory response (28),
Treg depletion (29), and enhances the therapeutic effect of vaccination (19). Anthracyclines induce the recruitment of a subset of
myeloid cells that are particularly efﬁcient at presenting tumor cell
Ag to CD8þ T cells in the tumor (30). However, these agents have
an ambivalent impact on the immune system: gemcitabine and 5ﬂuorouracil (5FU) induce massive tumor cell apoptosis and the
selective depletion of MDSCs in the spleen and tumor

growth by strongly activating the inﬂammasome in MDSCs

chemotherapy and immunotherapy, but also rapamycin and
immunotherapy, are being evaluated. Recent studies indeed
showed that rapamycin enhances the memory CD8þ T-cell differentiation and response to viral vaccines in mouse models of

Rapamycin Impedes Vaccine-Induced Tumor Rejection

to 22 after tumor graft or days 14 to 22). Surprisingly, we found
that rapamycin completely inhibits the CyaA-E7–induced CD8þ
T-cell recruitment to the tumor site and tumor regression in a
dose-dependent manner. Similarly, rapamycin abrogates the
induction of Ag-speciﬁc CTL responses. Furthermore, rapamycin
represses the CyaA-E7–induced reduction in Treg activation and
recruitment to the tumor site, clearly showing that in our model,
treatment with rapamycin is harmful to the vaccine-induced
antitumor immune responses.
mTOR is a microenvironment sensor that plays a major role in
many diseases, including cancer, where its pathways are highly
activated (1). Therefore, new cancer therapies are being evaluated
using rapamycin or its analogues to inhibit mTOR activation.
However, despite some promising results, particularly in the
treatment of RCC (8, 9) and mantle cell lymphoma (34), the
overall clinical results are not conclusive and show that rapamycin
and its analogues lead to disease stabilization rather than cancer
eradication in patients. This could be because rapamycin inhibits
cancer cell proliferation (35) but does not induce cell death.
Importantly, rapamycin and its analogues are also widely used
as immunosuppressive agents, especially in transplant patients.
By inhibiting mTOR, rapamycin inhibits the transduction of
microenvironmental signals, including cytokines, and abrogates
cell proliferation and protein synthesis in immune cells, thus
inhibiting immune responses (11). Rapamycin was ﬁrst used as
an immunosuppressive drug in combination with cyclosporine
and was shown to decrease the risk of posttransplant malignancies
(36, 37) due to its properties as an inhibitor of cancer cell
proliferation, leading to its use in cancer therapies.
In addition to blocking the cytokine-induced immune
response, rapamycin also regulates T-cell differentiation. Indeed,
mTOR controls the differentiation of na€ve CD4þ T cells into TH1,
TH2, or TH17 cells (38), whereas its inhibition favors Treg development (11, 39). However, less is known concerning the role of
mTOR in the differentiation and immune response of CD8þ T
cells. Surprisingly, recent studies showed that mTOR inhibition by
rapamycin enhances the CD8þ memory T-cell response in mice or
macaques after viral infection and/or vaccine-induced antiviral
responses (14, 16). Indeed, Araki and colleagues showed that
prolonged treatment with low-dose rapamycin (75 mg/kg/d)
enhances the numbers of Ag-speciﬁc virus CD8þ T cells and the
functional qualities of memory response, whereas a short-term
treatment favors memory T-cell differentiation (14). They also
showed that prolonged treatment with a higher dose of rapamycin
(600 mg/kg/d) enhanced the memory CD8þ T-cell response after
vaccination (14). A short-term treatment with a high dose of
rapamycin (750 mg/kg/d) also favored the induction of an Agspeciﬁc memory CD8þ T-cell response (15) and was more efﬁcient than a low-dose regimen (75 mg/kg/d). Temsirolimus, an
analogue of rapamycin, also promoted the vaccine-induced eradication of established tumors (27). However, none of these
studies analyzed the impact of rapamycin on the T-cell responses
and recruitment in lymphoid organs and more importantly at the
tumor site. Similarly, the impact of rapamycin on the antitumoral
responses in patients has not been reported. Therefore, in the
present study, we asked whether the rapamycin treatment of
tumor-bearing mice affects the vaccine-induced tumor regression
and T-cell response and recruitment to the tumor site and lymphoid organs.
In our TC-1 model, CyaA-E7 vaccination induced complete
tumor regression in 50% of the mice. To evaluate the impact of

www.aacrjournals.org

rapamycin on vaccination, we selected two doses of rapamycin,
750 and 75 mg/kg/d, administered as a chronic or short-term
treatment, according to previous studies. Surprisingly, both
regimens completely abrogated the CyaA-E7–induced tumor
eradication, whereas a short early treatment from days 0 to 7
with either dose had no effect. Moreover, although CyaA-E7
increased the numbers of tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells as previously demonstrated (19), 8 days after immunization, rapamycin completely inhibited the effect of CyA-E7. On day 25,
the inhibitory effect of rapamycin was still signiﬁcant on CTL
responses but not on the percentage of E7-speciﬁc T cells, in
contrast to the results obtained by Araki and colleagues (14).
However, another study obtained results similar to ours, showing that the rapamycin-induced memory response was
impaired in mice and memory CTL were unable to reject a
tumor challenge in mouse models of melanoma and breast
cancer (40).
Furthermore, rapamycin decreased the numbers of CD45þ cells
in the spleen, draining lymph nodes, and tumor. Because rapamycin inhibits the proliferation of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells and/or
dendritic cells (11, 14, 27) and also regulates T-cell migration (11),
we suggest that in our model, rapamycin impedes T-cell recruitment and expansion both in the lymphoid tissues and at the tumor
site. Previous studies have suggested that rapamycin favors the
differentiation of memory CD8þ T cells and increases the expression of memory markers, including CD62L and CD44. Our present
results contradict these observations. Indeed, we did not observe
any signiﬁcant effect of the rapamycin treatments on CD62L
expression on CD8þ T cells in the lymphoid organs or at the
tumor site. Moreover, the high-dose rapamycin treatments even
reduced the CD44 expression on CD8þ T cells in the lymphoid
organs. These data clearly show that in our model, rapamycin does
not enhance memory cell differentiation and function either.
Although we used the same protocols and doses of rapamycin
as in the studies mentioned above, our results are in disagreement
with their conclusions. These differences could be explained by
the use of different antigens, infection, and tumor models, by the
type of vaccine used, and by the route of infection. Indeed, both,
the LCMV virus used in one study (15) and the OVA-expressing
poxvirus used in another study (14), induce strong and persistent
CD8þ T-cell responses and inducing their differentiation into
memory CD8þ T cells by rapamycin treatment could be beneﬁcial.
On the contrary, although E7-expressing TC-1 cells induce CD8þ
T-cell response, it remains low/weak as compared with the one
induced by viruses or OVA. Furthermore, in the study by Araki and
colleagues, they used virus infection whereas we used tumor
inoculation. Moreover, the vaccines used in these two studies
were replicating and thus persisted longer than the vaccine used in
our model. Although the CyaA-E7 delivers the E7 antigen to
dendritic cells and induces an efﬁcient and therapeutic E7-speciﬁc
CD8þ T-cell response (19), this response remains low compared
with the CTL responses induced by viral infection and does not
persist for more than few weeks (1.16%  0.17% of E7-speciﬁc
CD8þ T cells on day 8 vs. 0.165%  0.047% on day 25 after
vaccination). Finally, we used the subcutaneous route of injection
for tumor inoculation, whereas Li and colleagues used a systemic
route (i.p.; ref. 15), thus inducing a different and stronger immune
response. Besides, we also showed that rapamycin inhibits the
OVA-speciﬁc CTL response in mice immunized with OVA/CpG, in
a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the study by Ferrer and
colleagues clearly showed that rapamycin has different effects on

the OVA-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell response induced in mice either by
infection with OVA-expressing bacteria or by OVA-expressing skin
graft. Indeed, rapamycin augmented the CD8þ T-cell response
only when induced by infection but not in the context of a
transplant (41).
In patients with cancer, the dose and length of administration
of rapamycin/analogues vary in each study and depending on the
cancer type. The weekly i.v. administration of temsirolimus (25
mg; ref. 8) or the daily oral administration of everolimus (10 mg)
are given to treat RCC (42), whereas 175-mg temsirolimus for 3
weeks followed by a 75 mg weekly administration is used to treat
mantle cell lymphoma (34). In contrast, in transplant patients, the
dosing of rapamycin and its analogues is signiﬁcantly lower than
in patients with cancer: 2–5 mg rapamycin given orally daily (43)
or 0.75–1 mg everolimus given orally every 12 hours (44). Here,
we tested different schedules and doses of rapamycin, a high dose,
close to that used in patients with cancer, and a low dose, close to
that used in transplant patients, and we show that, overall, all of
the tested regimens had a negative impact on T-cell recruitment
and activation and on tumor control.
It is now well established that the type and frequency of T cells
inﬁltrating the tumor site play a major role in disease control in
lung (45), breast (46), and colorectal (47) cancers. Indeed,
patients with higher inﬁltration of CD8þ T cells with cytotoxic
activity at the tumor site have increased disease-free survival rates
compared with patients with poor CD8þ T-cell inﬁltration (47),
clearly showing the importance of lymphocyte recruitment to
tumors (48), whereas Treg inﬁltration in ovarian and breast
cancers is a bad prognosis for patients (49, 50). To our knowledge,
our study, based on an extensive analysis of the T-cell compartment in the spleen, draining lymph nodes, and within tumors,
using a wide panel of surface molecules, is the ﬁrst demonstration
that rapamycin inhibits T-cell recruitment and expansion in
lymphoid tissues and at the tumor site while favoring Treg
recruitment and activation in tumors. Rapamycin treatment also
inhibits the induction of antigen-speciﬁc cytotoxic CD8þ T-cell
responses, thus completely abrogating the vaccine-induced tumor
eradication. Furthermore, rapamycin favors the intratumoral

recruitment of MDSC, known to inhibit cytotoxic CD8þ T cells
(23), thus further contributing to the suppression of the antitumor immune response.
Therefore, we clearly establish that although rapamycin might
act directly on tumor cells and inhibit their proliferation, in our
experimental model, rapamycin also inhibits T-cell recruitment to
the tumor site and the induction of antitumor immune response
by the CyaA-E7 vaccine. These data could explain why rapamycin
or its analogues gave only modest clinical results in patients with
cancer. Thus, the inﬂuence of mTOR inhibitors on antitumor
immunity deserves careful investigation in patients.
