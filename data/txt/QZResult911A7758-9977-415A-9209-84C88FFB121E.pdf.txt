ABSTRACT
Background: We conducted the retrospective study to compare the efficacy of
monotherapies versus two-drug regimens as postoperative chemotherapy for patients
with radically resected gastric cancer.
Result: At a median follow-up of 5.3 years, no significant difference in terms of OS
was observed between two groups, neither before nor after matching. After matching,
median DFS was statistically significant between group A and B (median, 67.5 vs 101.0
months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.95; P=0.027), which
meant doublets prolonged DFS. In subgroup analysis, the patients of stage III receiving
doublet achieved better OS than those receiving monotherapy. People who received
doublet and were less than 65 years old, or male patients, or in T4 stage, or in N2
stage, or receiving subtotal gastrectomy had better DFS than those with monotherapy.
Method: A data set including 501 patients (monotherapy, n=107; doublet,
n=394) was matched between the two groups (n=107 patients per group) using
the propensity-matched study. The primary and secondary endpoint was overall
survival(OS) and disease-free survival(DFS), respectively. Survival data was compared
using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportion hazards models for univariate and
multivariate analyses.
Conclusion: The dual regimens seemed not to add overall survival benefits to
patients receiving curative gastrectomy, compared with single-agent fluoropyrimidine
as postoperative chemotherapy. However, dual regimens showed better disease-free
survival.

trials and meta-analyses have authenticated the survival
advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in patients with curatively resected gastric

RESULTS

chemo-radiotherapy are well accepted in European and
American countries where D0 and D1 resections are
preferred choices, based on evidence from the MAGIC
and INT-0116 trials [3, 6]. In oriental countries where
D2 resection is routine, especially in Japan and China,
clinicians prefer to administrate S-1 single agent or
oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine based on the
results from the ACTS-GC and CLASSIC studies [2,
4]. The ACTS-GC study reported that postoperative
adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 alone reduced the risk
of death by 33%. The overall survival rate at 5 years was
71.7% in the S-1 group and 61.1% in the surgery-only
group [4]. Meanwhile, the CLASSIC trial confirmed that
adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin
(XELOX) after D2 surgery for patients from Asia with
stage II or III gastric cancer resulted in significantly
higher disease-free survival (DFS) [2]. The 3 year DFS
was 74% in the XELOX group and 59% in the surgery
only group. All the patients in CLASSIC and ACTSGC trials had undergone D2 node resection. However,
we can not compare with these two trials because their
endpoints were 5-year survival rate and 3-year diseasefree survival, respectively. Another randomized phase III
trial (ARTIST trial) suggested that the addition of XRT
(capecitabine plus radiotherapy) to XP (capecitabine
plus cisplatin) chemotherapy did not significantly
reduce recurrence after curative resection and D2 lymph
node dissection in gastric cancer [9]. Furthermore,
a randomized trial to investigate the efficacy and
toxicity of FOLFOX4 and LV5Fu2 regimens in patients
with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma after curative
gastrectomy demonstrated that the FOLFOX4 group
were better than the 5-FU/LV group in 3-year recurrence
free and the 3-year overall survival rate [10]. The study
shown a statistically significant overall survival for
FOLFOX4 group over control group, with a median 3-yr
RFS and 3-yr OS of 30.0 and 36.0 moths for FOLFOX4
group, versus 16.0 and 28.0 months in the control
group, respectively. However, another randomized trial
(ITACA-S study) which was designed to evaluate the
efficacy of a sequential treatment of FORFORI followed
by docetaxel plus cisplatin in comparison to 5-FU/LV
demonstrated that no statistically significant difference
was between multi-regimen and monotherapy in both
disease-free and overall survival [11]. Moreover, another
trial showed that S-1 plus paclitaxel was not superior to
paclitaxel alone in second-line chemotherapy in terms of
PFS and OS [12]. These approaches produce inconsistent
survival results, and the optimal adjuvant therapy for
patients of gastric cancer with radical gastrectomy has
not been established.
In our retrospective study, in an effort to identify the
standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric
cancer, we compared single agents with dual regimens
in terms of overall survival and disease-free survival in
patients with radically resected gastric cancer.

Matched patient characteristics
The median age was 59 years (ranging 19 to 85
years), with 73 male patients (68.2%), 52 patients
(48.6%) with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and
94 patients (87.9%) received subtotal gastrectomy in
matched patients of group A. Meanwhile, in group B, the
median age was 57 years (ranging from 19 to 86 years),
with 73 male patients (68.2%), 56 patients (52.3%)
with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and 88
patients (82.2%) received subtotal gastrectomy. All the
patients were treated with D2 lymphadenectomy. Before
matching, there were significant differences in variables
of lymph nodes stage and TNM stage. However, they
were well balanced after matching (Table 1). The
regimens were clearly listed (Table 2). In group A, 52
patients (48.6%) had been administrated capecitabine,
and in group B, 74 patients (69.1%) had received
oxaliplatin with a fluoropyrimidine (FOLFOX:32.7%,
XELOX:36.4%); The median number of treatment cycles
delivered was 5 (ranging 1-28) and 5 (ranging1-10) in
group A and B, respectively.

Overall survival and disease-free survival
By the last follow-up time on December 30th 2014,
the median follow-up time was 63.3 months and 65
months in group A and group B, respectively. 99 patients
(92.5%) in group A and 102 patients (95.3%) in group B
had finished the follow-up time. In monotherapy group, 58
patients (54.2%) were confirmed to have recurrent disease,
and 52 patients (48.6%) died. Whereas, in the doublet
group, 50 patients (46.7%) were confirmed to relapse, and
44 patients (41.1%) died. Before matching, among the
501 patients, the median OS were 84.4 months and 86.3
months (HR 0.99, 95%CI: 0.73-1.35) in group A and B,
respectively(P=0.946). Median DFS was 67.5 months with
group A and 69.0 months with group B (HR, 0.85; 95% CI,
0.63 to 1.13; P=0.256). However, after matching, median
DFS was significantly better in group B (101.0 months)
than that in group A (67.5 months; HR, 0.65; 95%CI, 0.45
to 0.95; P=0.027). There was no significant difference
between the two groups in terms of OS (Figure 1).
Univariable analysis identified six significant
prognostic variables associated with overall survival
(Table 3), Age(P=0.001), T stage(P=0.005), N
stage(P=0.000), TNM stage(P=0.000), Type of
resection(P=0.001) and Location of tumor(P=0.001).
In particular, Multivariate Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis identified that, regimens of therapy,
age, location of tumor, type of resection and N stage (all
P<0.05) were associated with OS (Table 4). However,
only Age, TNM stage and N stage were related with DFS
(Table 4).

Subgroup analysis

between the two arms before matching. It was likely
that the imbalance of TNM stage influenced the results
of survival analysis [2, 4]. Therefore, we performed
a propensity analysis. Moreover, after matching, the
multivariate analysis indicated that N stage not only had
a positive correlation with OS but also with DFS, which
confirmed the propensity-score analysis was necessary.
After matching, all the variables were well balanced
between the two arms. However, at a median follow-up
of 5.3 years, no significant difference was found between
the two groups in terms of OS, neither before nor after
matching. Subgroup analysis showed that the patients of
stage III received doublets achieved better overall survival
than those in monotherapy (Figure 2). Maybe the patients
with advanced stage would benefit from dual regimens,
and for those with tumors in early stage, monotherapy
turns to be a better choice. Markedly, after matching,
median DFS was statistically significantly different
between arm A and arm B (median, 67.5 vs 101.0 months,
respectively; HR, 0.95; P=0.027), which was consistent
with the results from previous trial [10, 11]. Consistently,
a meta-analysis by Iacovelli et al, reported a significant

Overall and disease-free survival were analyzed
according to age, gender, disease stage, type of resection,
histology type and location of tumor. None of the variables
but patients in stage III receiving doublets obtained
marked benefits in terms of OS (Figure 2). Importantly,
when examining predictors of disease-free survival, in
group B, the patients with less than 65 years old, or in
T4 stage, or in N2 stage, or male patients, or receiving
subtotal gastrectomy had better DFS than those in group
A (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
It is well accepted that adjuvant chemotherapy after
curative resection contributes survival benefits to gastric
cancer treatment [5, 14, 15]. Whether intensive multichemotherapy would achieve satisfactory results when
being compared to monotherapy remains attractive.

benefits. Interestingly, people who received two-drugs with
an age less than 65 years, or male patients, or in T4 stage,
or in N2 stage, or receiving subtotal gastrectomy had a
better DFS than those in monotherapy (Figure 3). Looking
at the results of the forest plots, an important stratified

factor able to discriminate between patients who benefit
from monotherapy versus intensive chemotherapy is the
location of the primary tumor. It seems that patients with
tumor located in the antrum fail to benefit from doublets
in terms of DFS and OS. According to the study presented
by Scartozzi M et al, different biological subtypes

of tumors lead to varied sensitivity to chemotherapy
treatments. They proposed a new classification for
gastric cancer(GC), based on Lauren’ s histology and on
anatomic tumor, identifying three subtypes of disease:
type 1(proximal non diffuse GC), type 2 (diffuse GC),

and type 3 (distal non diffuse GC) [17]. Proximal gastric
cancer is associated with the chronic Helicobacter pylori
infection and they seem to reduce the risk of death in some
case-control cohort studies [18, 19]. In particular, another
study confirmed that gene polymorphisms may affect the

chemotherapy sensitivity and metastatic process in gastric
cancer [20]. These studies suggested that subtypes of
gastric cancer may be important predictors for patients
with gastric cancer who could benefit from chemotherapy.
In clinical practice, oncologists are more likely to
prescribe single agent chemotherapy for older patients
or patients at earlier stage according to their physical
condition [21, 22]. However, our result demonstrated that
intensive two-drug chemotherapy regimen is better than
mild chemotherapy in disease-free survival after curative
resection with gastric cancer. From the Kaplan-Meier
curves of overall survival, the two curves clearly separated
after median overall survival, but with no significant
difference. Probably more participates and longer followup can help separated the whole curves completely. Our
result is in line with another observational study which
may point out the direction [23]. It is hypothesized that the
lack of a significant difference in overall survival between
patients treated with three or two drugs in first line, may be
associated with the influence of second-line or thereafter
treatments. Moreover, the benefit of salvage treatments in
patients with gastric cancer after progression to first-line
chemotherapy was well recognized [24–26]. Nevertheless,
our study failed to collect the adverse events between two
arms due to the loss of records. Yet, several trials showed
that the adverse events in both monotherapy and two-drug
regimens were manageable [10, 11, 27].
The propensity-score analysis made our study
convincing. Otherwise, the major limit of our study is
the small sample size after matching and selection bias
of the samples. Single-center and retrospective design are
another two limitations of our study.
In conclusion, this retrospective study was
complementary to phase III prospective trials which
compared the efficacy and safety between different
regimens. Our study demonstrated that dual regimens are
a better choice for patients with high risk factors as stage
III, and N2 stage.

no previous malignancies; and no chemotherapy or
radiotherapy prior to surgery.
The inclusive patients were divided into two
groups, A and B, based on the postoperative adjuvant
chemotherapy regimens used (group A=monotherapy;
group B=two drugs).

Statistical methods
The Chi-square test was used to compare the
characteristics between the two groups. Survival analysis
was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and
compared using the log-rank test. All the statistical tests
were two-sided. Meanwhile, Cox proportional hazards
regression models were used to assess the effects of
potential predictive variables on the DFS and OS with
95%CIs. Age, gender, T stage, N stage, TNM stage,
type of resection, histology, and location of tumor were
entered into a Cox regression model with forward stepwise
selection of covariates. The threshold of entering and
removing limits was 0.05 and 0.10, respectively.
Disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated as the
period from the date of surgery to the date of recurrence or
the last follow-up date. Overall survival (OS) was defined
as the period from the date of surgery to the date of death
of any cause or until last follow-up. All statistical analyses
were performed with the SPSS, version 13.0 (Chicago, IL,
USA).

Propensity score analysis
Propensity score matching is a tool for causal
inference and adjust a treatment effect for measure
confounders in non-randomized studies using SPSS.
The software generates estimation of propensity score
using logistic regression and specifying nearestneighbor matching with all covariates. Detailed
balance statistics and relevant graphs are produced by
the program“PS Matching”in SPSS [13]. In the present
study, Age, Gender, T stage, N stage, TNM stage, Type
of resection, Histology and Location of tumor were
entered into a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic
regression model. By this means, 107 of 107 patients
who underwent monotherapy were matched with 107 of
394 patients who were treated with doublet with similar
propensity scores (Table 1). Patient demographics and
tumor characteristics for the matched groups were listed
(Table 1).

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
To evaluate whether a two-drug regimen could be
comparable to a single-agent approach as postoperative
adjuvant chemotherapy in patients after curative
gastrectomy, a retrospective analysis was conducted in
Sun Yat-Sen cancer center. Between January 2000 and
December 2010, a total of 501 gastric carcinoma patients
who received radical surgery and followed by adjuvant
chemotherapy were enrolled. The inclusive criteria were as
follows: Patients aged 18 years or order with histologically
confirmed stomach carcinoma; curative resection with D2
lymph node dissections; no evidence of distant metastases;
TNM stage of IB-IIIC (according to the seventh edition
