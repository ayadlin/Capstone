ABSTRACT
Neuroblastoma (NB) is a threatening childhood malignancy. Its prognosis
is affected by several morphological, and biological characteristics, including the
constitutive expression of ALK tyrosine kinase. In this study we examined the
therapeutic potential of a novel ALK inhibitor, entrectinib, in obliterating NB tumor cells.
Entrectinib showed the growth-inhibitory effects on NB cells with a 50%
inhibitory concentration range of 0.03–5 μM. In the ALK-dependent cells, entrectinib
mediated G1-arrest, which was associated with modified expression of multiple
cell-cycle regulators. Down-regulation of Ki-67, and attenuated phosphorylation of
ERK1/2, and STAT3, correlated with observed antiproliferative capacity of entrectinib.
Initial cytostatic activity of entrectinib was followed by concentration-dependent
apoptotic cell death, and Caspase-3 activation. However, we delineated a reduced
sensitivity of ALK mutated NB cells to entrectinib, and demonstrated strong activation
of autophagy in SH-SY5YF1174L NB cell line. Abrogation of autophagy by chloroquine
increased significantly the toxicity of entrectinib, as confirmed by enhanced death
rate, and PARP protein cleavage in SH-SY5YF1174L cells.
In aggregate, our data show that entrectinib inhibits proliferation, and induces
G1-arrest, and apoptosis in NB cells. We propose entrectinib for further consideration
in treatment of NB, and recommend pharmacological inhibition of autophagy to be
explored for a combined therapeutic approach in NB patients that might develop
resistance to entrectinib.

prognosis, whereas increased expression of TrkB, and
Survivin, were associates with unfavorable outcome [5–
7]. More recently, the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase)
gene has been found mutated in about 8% of sporadic NB,
and has been associated with rapid disease progression
[6–8].
ALK gene encodes for a cell surface neural receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) which is dominantly expressed in
developing embryonic, and neonatal brain [9]. The ALK
mutations are shown to give the proliferative advantages
to the cells in which they occur [10], and the constitutive
activation of ALK gene has been found to give a particular
negative impact over prognosis of NB [11]. The ALKF1174L,
and ALKR1275Q are the most frequent mutations found in
sporadic NBs, leading to a single amino acid substitution
in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of ALK receptor

INTRODUCTION
Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common
cancers in children under 1 year of age, and accounts
for 15% of all pediatric cancer mortality [1]. While
some NBs respond strongly to treatment or even regress
spontaneously without cure, there are still a considerable
number of NB cases in which current therapy is ineffective
[2]. Some clinical, and molecular biological factors
correlate with outcome of NB patients, and are defined
as prognostic markers of this disease [3]. MYCN gene
amplification has been observed in about 20% of all
NB cases, and represents one of the strongest markers
associated with the aggressiveness of the disease [4].
Increased expression of other genes, such as TrkA, and
caspase-1/-3/-8, were described to correlate with favorable

[12]. Similarly to other RTK, these mutations cause a
constitutive activation of ALK receptor, and downstream
ALK-dependent regulatory pathways, giving a crucial
impact over NB oncogenesis. Taken together, these findings
introduced the possibility of targeting ALK protein in NB
patients. During recent years, several compounds have been
proposed for the treatment of patients with deregulated
ALK protein, showing a diverse efficiency, and specificity
[12, 13]. Nevertheless, the obstacle related to the use of
ALK inhibitors in NB therapy remains their low efficiency
in impairment of ALK-mutated NBs’ growth. This problem
is usually correlated with the acquired resistance of tumor
cells, which prevents the successful treatment of NB
patients [14, 15]. Hence, it becomes necessary to screen
for a more successful therapeutic approaches, to overcome
current therapy restrictions.
Here, we tested a novel ALK inhibitor entrectinib
(RXDX-101) (Ignyta, San Diego) for its capacity to
abrogate growth of NB cell lines with different status of
ALK gene (wild type, mutated or amplified) in vitro. We
showed that entrectinib was able to impair ALK-amplified
(ALKamp) cells’ growth, and proliferation, whereas its
activity was less effective in NB cell lines bearing ALK
mutation (ALKF1174L, and ALKR1275Q), or wild type (ALKwt)
gene. We investigated for a mechanism possibly involved
in low efficiency of entrectinib in ALK-mutated cells,
and observed that autophagy induction after entrectinib
addition was responsible for drug resistance. Chemical
inhibition of autophagy increased significantly the
efficiency of entrectinib in ALK-mutated cells, suggesting
a combined therapy as a promising approach in patients
with ALKF1174L or ALKR1275Q positive tumors.

reduce NB cells’ proliferation was validated in following.
Concomitantly, after 24h of treatment, the cells showed a
significant proliferative block that was directly proportional
to the concentration of entrectinib used, and was maintained
until 72h of treatment (Figure 1B; Supplementary Table S2).
Decreased proliferative capacity of entrectinib treated
NB cells was confirmed by evaluating Ki-67 nuclear
antigen, an important marker of cell proliferation [16], by
Real Time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). We confirmed a
significant decreasing of Ki-67 mRNA 24h after treatment
with entrectinib, particularly in NB1, NB3, and SH-SY5Y
cell lines, and in a lesser extent in IMR32 cells (DMSO
control: RQ = 1; RQ of treatments: NB1 = 0.34 ± 0.06,
p = 0.0005; NB3 = 0.62 ± 0.14, p = 0.05; SH-SY5Y =
0.52 ± 0.08, p = 0.006; IMR32 = 0.73 ± 0.05, p = 0.004;
n = 3; Figure 1C). These results have been confirmed by
immunocytochemistry, demonstrating the increased fraction
of Ki-67 negative entrectinib-treated cells particularly in
NB1 cell line, and less marked expressional changes of Ki67 protein in IMR32 cells (Supplementary Figure S2).

Entrectinib induces block in G1-phase of cell-cycle
Observed proliferative reduction of NB cells was
caused in part by cell-cycle inhibition, as confirmed
by propidium iodide staining analysis. The cellcycle distribution in NB1 cells, treated with a single
concentration of entrectinib (0.08 μM), demonstrated
a significant accumulation in G1-phase after 24h, with
respect to control (G1, 24h: DMSO = 55.4 ± 3.0 %;
entrectinib = 83.0 ± 4.3 %; n = 3, p = 0.006; Figure
2A). Additionally, a decrease of S-phase was confirmed
(S, 24h: DMSO = 38.6 ± 2.8 %; entrectinib = 6.5 ± 4.4
%; n = 3, p = 0.004; Figure 2A). For the remaining 3
cell lines, a tendency of G1-arrest was observed even
though a statistical significance was not reached for the
concentration of entrectinib used (2.5 μM; Supplementary
Figure S3A, S3B and S3C). Moreover, we examined the
association between entrectinib-induced G1-arrest, and
alteration of cell-cycle regulatory genes. We analyzed the
expression contents of p21, p27, Cyclin A1, Cyclin D1,
Cyclin E1, RB1, and E2F1 genes, which are well-known
cell-cycle regulators. Expression levels of RB1, E2F1,
Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, and Cyclin A1, were significantly
reduced in entrectinib treated NB1 cells, whereas the
contents of p21, and p27 were markedly increased (Figure
2B, and Supplementary Table S3) when compared to
control samples (DMSO: RQ = 1), mirroring the changes
in cell-cycle distribution observed previously. The similar
changes in genes’ expression were found for the remaining
NB cell lines (Supplementary Figure S3A’, S3B’ and
S3C’). A block of NB1 cells in G1-phase has been
confirmed by Western blot analysis as well, showing a
particular accumulation of p21 protein 24h post-treatment
with entrectinib (Figure 2C). Oppositely, levels of Cyclin
A1, and E1 were down-regulated.

RESULTS
Entrectinib blocks proliferation of NB cells
To evaluate the concentration range activity of
entrectinib, we treated NB1amp, NB3R1275Q, SHSY5YF1174L, and
IMR32wt cells with increasing concentrations of entrectinib.
The cell viability was checked after 24h, 48h, and 72h, by
MTT assay. The inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50)
was calculated for each time point (Supplementary Table
S1). Dose dependent cell viability reduction was observed
in all cell lines. However, the cell viability was highly
depressed in NB1amp cells, which was extremely sensitive
to entrectinib treatment (48h IC50 = 0.035 ± 0.009 μM).
Sensitivity of other cell lines (NB3R1275Q, SH-SY5YF1174L,
IMR32wt) was also detected although it was lower with
respect to NB1 cells (48h IC50; NB3 = 2.24 ± 0.89 μM; SHSY5Y = 3.32 ± 0.90 μM, IMR32 = 3.29 ± 0.35 μM; Figure
1A). Subsequently, we looked whether entrectinib induces
cell morphology changes. We observed dramatic cell shape
changes since the cells became smaller in size. Moreover,
NB cells greatly reduced the capacity to become confluent
(Supplementary Figure S1). A capacity of entrectinib to

Addition of entrectinib decreases the clonogenic
capacity of NB cells

4C. Collectively, these results imply for entrectinib
to be a potent inhibitor of NB cells growth, which is
hampered by cell-cycle blocking, and inducted apoptosis.
Other hallmarks of apoptosis, including mitochondrial
membrane depolarization, and generation of reactive
oxygen species, were not stimulated after use of IC50 dose
of entrectinib (data not shown).

We seeded NB cells in methylcellulose in addition
of entrectinib to investigate the possibility of entrectinib
to impair NB cells to form colonies, and let them to
proliferate for 14 days (Figure 3A, left panel). The
entrectinib gave rise to significantly fewer, and smaller
colonies with respect to control cells (colony number
NB1: DMSO = 803.8 ± 29.0; entrectinib = 548.4 ±
40.0; n = 3; p = 0.001; NB3: DMSO = 522.7 ± 35.0;
entrectinib = 348.7 ± 10.3; p = 0.006; n = 3; SH-SY5Y:
DMSO = 727.0 ± 65.5; entrectinib = 437 ± 70.9; n = 3;
p = 0.04; IMR32: DMSO = 648.5 ± 19.3; entrectinib =
541.5 ± 47.0; n = 3; p = 0.08; Figure 3A, right panel)
in all cell lines tested. Together, these results indicated
that entrectinib had the capacity to inhibit NB cells to
form the colonies.

Entrectinib blocks ALK-dependent signaling
pathway
The observed results prompted us to evaluate for the
possible changes in ALK-downstream signaling pathway
after addition of entrectinib. Abrogation of ALK function
by adding entrectinib (IC50 or increasing concentrations),
led to a decreased expression of pERK1/2, and pSTAT3
proteins, two principal regulators of cell proliferation, in
concentration, and time dependent manner (Figure 5A
and 5B). Similar effects were seen for all NB cell lines
tested, supporting the proliferative advantages of the NB
cells with deregulated ALK function.

Entrectinib reduces motility of NB cells
The time-lapse microscopy of NB cells after
treatment with entrectinib revealed an inhibition of the
motility of NB1, NB3, SH-SY5Y, and IMR32 cells upon
entrectinib treatment. In the scratch assay, DMSO control
cells were able to migrate into the scratch area, whereas
treatment with entrectinib prevented wound closure.
The scratch area (expressed as percentage of total area;
Figure 3B, 3C, 3D and 3E, left images) significantly
decreased for the control cells, whereas it remained
largely uncovered in the presence of entrectinib (Figure
3B, 3C, 3D and 3E, right graph bars). We also observed
differences in the velocity of treated cells to repopulate
the scratch zone compared to controls. In particular, a
complete closure was reached after 48h for IMR32, 72h
for SH-SY5Y, and NB3, and after 96h for NB1 (data not
shown). Our results clearly demonstrated the strong antimigratory effects of entrectinib on NB cells with different
ALK gene status.

Autophagy induction in SH-SY5Y cell line
explains the low entrectinib efficiency
ALKF1174L is considered one of the most aggressive
ALK mutations in NB, and shows high transforming
potential [17]. In view of the poorer efficiency of
entrectinib to induce cell death in ALK mutated NB cells,
particularly SH-SY5YF1174L, we speculated that some
protective mechanism could be activated, contributing
to the observed scenario. Autophagy represents the most
common adaptive cellular response in cancer that can
enhance the tumor cell survival during treatments [18].
One of the most specific indicators of autophagosome
formation, and hence autophagy activation, is a
microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)
[19, 20]. At first, we checked how the levels of LC3-I,
and LC3-II changed after addition of entrectinib. The
expression of LC3-II protein was significantly induced
after treatment with entrectinib for 48h (Figure 6A, upper
lane), and was more evident with increase of entrectinib
concentration (24h; Figure 6A, lower lane). This event was
particularly marked in SH-SY5Y cells, and was confirmed
by calculating the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, demonstrating a
clear prevalence of LC3-II levels in treated samples with
respect to DMSO controls (LC3-II/LC3-I ratio: DMSO =
1 Arbitrary Units; entrectinib 5 μM = 5.4 AU; entrectinib
7.5 μM = 5.6 AU; Figure 6A, lower lane). Moreover,
our results revealed the degradation of autophagic
marker p62/SQSTM1 (Figure 6B) [21]. Interestingly,
Beclin-1 levels, as an apical regulator of autophagy, did
not increase significantly after treatment with diverse
entrectinib concentrations, implying that the mechanism of
autophagy activation in SH-SY5Y was likely independent
of Beclin-1, as reported in other studies as well [22].

Entrectinib triggers cell death in NB cell lines
To assess the possible induction of apoptosis,
we treated NB cells with increasing concentrations
of entrectinib. A significant increase in Caspase-3
activation was found for NB1 cell line, and in
comparable extent for NB3, SH-SY5Y, and IMR32 cells
(Figure 4A; Supplementary Table S4; n = 3; p<0.05).
A dosage-dependent increase of dying cells was also
observed by TUNEL assay (Figure 4B; Supplementary
Table S5; n = 3; p<0.05). At the protein level, cell death
induction was confirmed by studying the expression of the
early marker of apoptosis poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP), which was fragmented proteolytically by
Caspase-3. An evident cleavage of PARP protein
occurred due to entrectinib activity as shown in Figure

To further confirm that the autophagy was
induced in SH-SY5Y cells after addition of entrectinib,
we performed a transient transfection with GFP-LC3
plasmid. Under the fluorescence microscope, GFPLC3-transfected cells treated with DMSO showed a
diffuse distribution of green fluorescence, whereas

entrectinib treatment (5 μM) triggered vesicle
formation, creating a punctuated form of GFP-LC3
protein (Figure 6C). The diverse patterns confirmed
that LC3 was engaged in autophagosome formation
in entrectinib-induced autophagy in SH-SY5YF1174L
cell line.

Autophagy induction after entrectinib treatment
was less obvious in NB3 cell line

Tam lead to an increase of p62 levels, which drastically
diminished in combination with entrectinib, implying
for an enforcement of autophagic flux (Figure 7C, lane
3 and 4). Treatment with Rapa did not change p62, and
LC3 levels, but did increase a cleavage of PARP protein
when used in combination with entrectinib, suggesting
for enforced apoptosis activation. These results
suggested that NB1 cells survival was highly dependent
on ALK activity, which may be considered as the main
pathway that gave them the proliferative benefits. This
also indicates that entrectinib affects autophagic flux,
most probably at LC3-II level by sequestration into
autophagosome. The opposite experiment performed on
SH-SY5Y cells, using other autophagy inhibitors which
are known to act upstream of phagophore formation (e.g.
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Ly), and 3-Methyladenine (3MA)) supported these findings. Once again, entrectinib
caused mild effects over cell death (PARP protein
cleavage) when used alone in SH-SY5Y cells, but
caused the important expressional changes of autophagy
proteins LC3, and p62 (Figure 7D, lane 2 versus lane 1).
Inhibition of autophagy after combination of entrectinib
with LY294002, or 3-MA, was confirmed particularly at
the level of p62 protein (Figure 7D, lane 4 and 6 versus
lane 2) even though entrectinib maintained its capacity
to induce stimulation of LC3-II. In addition, we also
revealed the changes in the mTOR-regulating signaling
pathway during autophagy activation (Supplementary
Figure S4), which suggested that it might be involved in
the regulation of this biological process as well. Taken
together, these results confirmed a key role of autophagy
in helping NB mutated cells to evade apoptosis in the
presence of entrectinib, and suggested for the combined
treatment of ALK- and autophagic-inhibitors in treatment
of NB cells bearing ALK gene mutation.

Our data demonstrate that the NB3R1275Q cells are
slightly more sensitive to entrectinib than SH-SY5YF1174L.
To examine how different ALK mutations may affect
induction of autophagy in response to entrectinib, we
checked the expression of principal autophagy regulators
in NB3 cells 24h post-treatment. Even in this cell line
we could observe autophagy activation, although it was
less marked in comparison to SH-SY5Y cells (Figure
6D). Beside decrease in p62 protein levels, increase in
LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (LC3-II/LC3-I ratio: DMSO = 1 AU;
entrectinib 2.5 μM = 2.14 AU; entrectinib 5 μM = 2.81
AU; entrectinib 7.5 μM = 3.42 AU), and marginal cleavage
of PARP protein, we confirmed a slight up-regulation of
Beclin-1 protein for NB3 cell line (Figure 6D). These
results indicated that autophagy induction followed a
different pattern in diverse NB cell lines, but contributed
directly to the sensitivity of NB cells to entrectinib.

Inhibition of autophagy potentiates entrectinibstimulated cell death
To examine autophagic flux in SH-SY5YF1174L
cell line, we analyzed LC3-II in the presence of the
lysosomal protease inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) [23]. We
pre-treated SH-SY5Y cells with CQ (50 μM; for 1h),
and subsequently added entrectinib (5 μM) to operate for
24h. Afterwards, proteins were extracted for Western blot
analysis, while cell death was measured by flow cytometry
(TUNEL assay). The dynamic autophagic process was
confirmed after inhibition of lysosomal protease by
CQ, through a notable accumulation of LC3-II, p62,
and Beclin-1 proteins (Figure 7A). In addition, LC3II levels increased further in CQ-entrectinib co-treated
cells compared to control. These findings implied that the
observed accumulation of autophagic vacuoles resulted
from autophagy induction rather than from their decreased
degradation by lysosomes [24]. More importantly, the
effects of CQ, in CQ+entrectinib combined treatment,
provoked an increase in cell death, as confirmed by both,
Western blot (PARP activation, Figure 7A) analysis or
TUNEL assay (DMSO = 5.8 ± 1.0; CQ = 29.4 ± 7.1;
entrectinib = 27.0 ± 9.8; CQ+entrectinib = 68.8 ± 3.9; n =
3; p<0.05; Figure 7B).
To explore whether the protective role of autophagy
against entrectinib-induced cell death was cell specific,
we chemically stimulated autophagy in NB1 cells by
Tamoxifen (T), and Rapamycin (Ra), two well-known
autophagic stimulators. After pre-treatment with T and
Ra, cells were treated with entrectinib, and LC3-II, and
p62 levels were examined after 24h. Even though both
compounds showed a capacity to increase LC3 cleavage
(LC3-I), and modification (LC3-II), the final effects
were somewhat different (Figure 7C). In particular,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Autophagy activation is an early event in SHSY5Y
Additionally, to define timing of autophagy
activation after entrectinib administration, we treated
SH-SY5Y cells for 6h (5 μM), and analyzed LC3 protein
expression afterwards. We could confirm that a protective
mechanism in SH-SY5Y cells was activated rapidly
in the presence of entrectinib, since LC3-II increased
significantly even at this early time point. Autophagy
was not observed in NB1 cell line after entrectinib
treatment, which was in concordance with other results
seen previously for this cell line. On the contrary, NB1
cells were highly sensitive to ALK inhibition attained by
entrectinib. We could see that the kinetic of entrectinib
in inducing NB1 cell death was quick as well, since 6h
treatment provoked a marked PARP cleavage (Figure 8).
These findings imply that NB1 are ALK-addicted cells, in
which ALK pathway obstruction provokes a destructive
cell survival effect.

Crizotinib causes different autophagy-defined
pattern in NB cells with respect to entrectinib,
and marginal apoptosis activation

correlated with resistance to this drug [26]. To define
whether crizotinib could provoke autophagy induction
in ALK-mutated NB cells, we treated these cells with
increasing concentration of crizotinib. After defining
IC50 (Supplementary Table S6), we selected several
concentration under, and above IC50 value, treated the

Crizotinib, as a well known anti-ALK drug
(PF02341066) was used for the treatment of some
tumors, such as a non–small-cell lung cancer with ALK
rearrangements [25]. However, it was seen that crizotinib
can induce autophagy in lung cancer cells, which

NB, MYCN, and ALK, have been identified as the major
pathogenic markers of this malignancy [12]. Therefore,
it is understandable why the use of drugs against these
markers represents a base for targeted therapy in NB
patients. Relatively high frequency of NB patients with
deregulated ALK tyrosine kinase rationalizes the ALKtargeting approach, which has been adopted during the
recent years [17, 30]. Nonetheless, the ALK-inhibition is
found to be a problematic issue due to a rapid resistance
development.
Nowadays, the resistance to the kinase inhibitors
became one of the most awkward concerns of the
oncologists [31]. This is true for the majority of solid
tumors, including NBs. In particular, the advanced-stage
NB tumors have a high frequency of treatment resistance,
urging for innovative, and less aggressive therapies to be
defined. To date, several ALK inhibitors have been tested
for their efficiency to impede the NB growth, each with
different activity [32].
The present study assessed the capability of
entrectinib, a novel ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to
interfere with cancer cell growth, and proliferation. We
tested its influence over viability, and motility of NB cells

was more evident for the SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 9). In
these cells we observed the increase in LC3-II/LC3-I ratio
(LC3-II/LC3-I ratio: DMSO = 1 AU; crizotinib 0.6 μM =
1.36 AU; crizotinib 1.25 μM = 1.48 AU; crizotinib 2.5 μM
= 1.45 AU; crizotinib 5 μM = 2.52 AU), slight increase
in Beclin-1 level, and almost unchanged expression of
p62 protein. In NB3 cell line, there was no significant
activation of autophagy after treatment with crizotinib
(Figure 9). In addition, similarly to entrectinib, cell lines
bearing ALK mutations demonstrated PARP cleavage
only at the concentrations around defined IC50 and above,
pointing out that they generally showed poor susceptibility
to crizotinib.

DISCUSSION
Neuroblastoma represents an embryonic tumor
which derives from over-proliferating primitive neuroblast
cells of the sympathetic nervous system. The most of
NB cases are diagnosed during childhood [27]. Around
15 % of all childhood cancer deaths occur due to NB,
which makes it a tumor with a great medical, and social
impact [28, 29]. Some of the main genes described in

Figure 8: Autophagy activation is an early event in ALKF1174L mutated cells. A. Western blot analysis was done for the evaluation
of LC3 processing, and hence, autophagy activation. NB1 and SH-SY5Y cells were treated shortly (6h) with entrectinib (e), using 0.04 μM,
and 2.5 μM, respectively, and in following the expression of LC3-I, and LC3-II proteins was validated. We could confirm autophagy to
be an early protective event in SH-SY5YF1174L cells, being activated after only 6h of treatment with entrectinib. On the contrary, in NB1amp
cells, entrectinib showed an immediate apoptosis activation, as confirmed by cleavage of PARP protein, which has not been observed for
SH-SY5Y cells. Gapdh was used as protein loading control. D = DMSO.

with various mutation status of ALK gene, and validated
entrectinib-dependent cell death mediation in vitro.
We confirmed that the administration of entrectinib
impaired cell proliferation, and abrogated cell-cycle
progression, causing the G1-arrest. The rate of cellcycle blockage after the treatment was concomitant
with diminished expression of the Ki-67, and with the
changes in the expression of the genes involved in cellcycle regulation. Nevertheless, we delineated a different
amplitude of behavior to drug treatment between the
ALK amplified or ALK mutated cells, confirming the
results discussed by other groups [33]. The results
obtained after treatment with entrectinib allowed us to
determine that the NB1 cell line was strongly addicted
to ALK activity, whereas ALK-mutation bearing cells
were less ALK-dependent. In detail, we confirmed the
impairment of ALK-downstream signaling molecules,
such as pSTAT3, and pERK1/2, in the presence
of entrectinib in all cell lines. As a consequence,
proliferation of NB cells was impaired, and colony
formation capacity was drastically decreased with
respect to control treated samples. Also, the motility of
the NB cells was significantly inhibited upon addition
of entrectinib. However, described cytostatic effects of
entrectinib were delineated with diverse intensity among
examined NB cell lines.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Furthermore, our data indicated that entrectinib
induced Caspase-3 dependent cell death, showing a
dose-dependent effect in NB cells. At the protein level,
cell mortality induction was confirmed in varying degree
between ALK-amplified, mutated, or wild-type gene, by
studying PARP protein cleavage.
Particular interest in our study was given to
understand why the entrectinib efficacy was drastically
lower in ALK-mutation bearing cells. We delineated that
the mutation occurrence decreased the cell susceptibility to
entrectinib through autophagy induction. Treatment of SHSY5YF1174L cells with entrectinib resulted in the increased
expression of LC3-II, and decreased level of p62 protein,
both in time- and dosage-dependent manner. Autophagy
was also morphologically characterized by evaluating the
autophagosome formation in GFP-LC3 transfected SHSY5Y cells.
In trying to overcome the observed resistance, and
improving the efficiency of entrectinib in these cells,
we adopted the combination strategy, using entrectinib
together with autophagy inhibitor, Chloroquine (CQ).
This treatment rendered the tumor cells prone to death,
translating the protective role of autophagy toward
apoptosis induction, as confirmed by PARP cleavage,
and increased percentage of dead cells in treated samples.
These observations allow us to postulate for the existence
5658

of alternative signaling pathways which activation might
influence a therapy response in NB patients. In various
cancers, proteins from the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are found altered
[33], and have been correlated with autophagy regulation.
In our study, we could also confirm the modulation of
the mTOR-dependent pathway in SH-SY5Y cells’ after
entrectinib administration. More precisely, we confirmed
that the co-treatment of entrectinib, and Rapamycin, a
well-known mTOR inhibitor, was a good strategy to
further improve the effects of ALK-inhibitor in NB1 cells.
These data support the findings of Moore et al., obtained
during examination of crizotinib efficiency in NB [34]. As
crizotinib, entrectinib is also a promising ALK inhibitor,
and both of drugs are currently in clinical trials for
ALK-driven tumors (NCT01154140, and STARTRK-1,
respectively). Although both drugs are potent inhibitors
of wild-type ALK and ALK fusions, entrectinib is able to
inhibit certain ALK mutants that are otherwise resistant
to crizotinib [35]. The different sensitivity is likely due to
differences in the exact positioning, and bonding of the
inhibitor-target interaction between these two compounds
(manuscript in preparation). In addition, unlike crizotinib,
entrectinib is able to efficiently cross the blood-brain
barrier therefore targeting brain tumors and brain
metastases [36].
In conclusion, entrectinib inhibited NB cell
proliferation, induced cell death, and caused cell cycle
arrest, influencing largely the ALK downstream signaling
pathway. Our findings identifies entrectinib as a potent
inhibitor of ALK-amplified NB1 cells, which seem
to be highly dependent on ALK activity, implying for
ALK-addiction [37]. On the other side, a low efficiency
in ALK-mutated NB cells was supported by the
autophagy activation, which was successfully abrogated
by combination therapy. In particular, we propose cotreatment of ALK-inhibitor, and CQ, as an effective
approach in managing drug resistance, and likely
recurrence, or metastasis of NB tumors. The combined
treatment strategy may be critical for the increased
clinical efficacy of anti-ALK drugs. Our data are in a
good agreement with those of Zhang et al and Mitou et
al, since they confirm a protective role of autophagy in
ALK-dependent tumors other than NB, after use of ALKinhibitors [26, 38]. Altogether, our data suggest that
the pharmacological inhibition of autophagy may be a
valuable approach to combat acquired resistance to ALKtyrosine kinase inhibitor entrectinib, which we propose
for a clinical evaluation in NB patients.

IRCCS AOU San Martino – IST, Genoa, Italy, were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan,
Italy) with addition of antibiotics (1%), and fetal bovine
serum (FBS; 10%; Gibco, Life Technologies, Monza,
Italy). DNA typing for the cell line authentication was
done prior the analyses. For each experiment, equal
numbers of cells were seeded, and the concentration of
DMSO equivalent to those of the chemicals used, was
applied to control cells. Entrectinib was provided by
Ignyta Inc. (San Diego, CA) under a material transfer
agreement; Chloroquine (CQ), 3-Methyladenine (3MA), Tamoxifen (Tam), Rapamycin (Rapa), Ly294002
(Ly), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, crizotinib from Selleck Chemicals
(Munich, Germany). The concentrations of the
compounds used in the study were adapted for each
experiment before use.

Measurement of cell proliferation, viability and
mortality
Log-phase cells were seeded into the 96-wells plate
(15.000 cells/well), and were allowed for the attachment
overnight followed by the treatment with entrectinib
(0-10 μM) for 24h, 48h and 72h. Cellular proliferation
was quantified with colorimetric methods based on the
metabolic reduction of the soluble yellow MTT (3(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) dye to its insoluble formazan [39]. Absorbance
was red by VICTOR™ Multilabel Plate Reader
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) at 486 nm. Results were
normalized to time point zero (T= 0h), and calculated for
each treatment with respect to DMSO treated controls.
Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion
assay plating 1 × 105 cells / well in 24 wells plate a day
before treatment with entrectinib. The following day,
for one randomly selected well, the starting cell number
was calculated (T= 0h), whereas to the remaining cells,
increasing concentration of entrectinib was administered.
Until the 3rd day, every 24h cell number was calculated
after trypsinization, centrifugation, and re-suspension in
500 μl of 1xPBS. Staining was done with 0.5% trypan
blue. The unstained cells were quantified using the
Countess™ automated cell counter (Invitrogen) and final
data were calculated with respect to the number of cell
determined at time point zero (T= 0h), corresponding
to the value 1 on the graph. Cell death was measured
by flow cytometer Cytomics FC500 (Beckman Coulter,
Brea, CA) using the Apodirect Kit (BD Bioscience, San
Diego, CA). Fluorescein labeled TdT-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay allowed distinction of
dying NB cells after treatment with entrectinib. Apoptosis
was measured by flow cytometry measuring activation of
Caspase-3, one of the hallmarks of early apoptotic events.
Preparation of the cells for analysis was done as suggested
by manufacturer.

and anti-Gapdh, (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO),
anti-p62/SQSTM1 (Abnova, Taipei City, Taiwan), antiALK (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
In following, the membranes were incubated with
a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1h at
room temperature, and the immunoreactive bands were
detected with chemiluminescence substrate kit (ECL
advance; Amersham Pharmacia Biotec, Piscataway, NJ)
under the Alliance imaging system (UVItec, Cambridge,
UK). Re-probing of a blot with new primary antibodies
was done after the stripping of antigen-antibody complex
using a mild stripping solution (0.2 M glycine-HCl,
pH 2.2, 0.1% SDS, 0.01% Tween-20) for 1h at room
temperature, followed by 3 washing with 1xPBS with
0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich). The membranes were
then blocked as described, and re-probed with primary,
and secondary antibodies as described.

Total cellular RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies), as indicated by the
manufacturer and the quality was controlled on Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Tokyo, Japan).
One mg of total RNA was reversely transcribed using
random hexamers, and the Superscript II (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene
expression was evaluated by quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR;
Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System)
using SYBR Green PCR Master Mixture Reagents (Applied
Biosystems, Forest City, CA). The primer sets are available
upon request. Gapdh was used to normalize levels of
mRNA for the relative quantification method of analysis.
qRT-PCR reactions (20 μL) were carried out as triplicate
reactions, and final data were calculated from three separate
experiments. Relative quantification analysis was done
using the comparative ddCt method [40]. Experimental data
were expressed as the mean ± SEM of the n-fold change
from at least three independent experiments.

Colony formation assay
Two thousand cells of each NB cell type were seeded
in a 24 wells plate using MethoCult semi-solid medium
(Stemcell Technologies, Milan, Italy), with the addition
of entrectinib (concentration adapted for each cell type) or
control DMSO vehicle, and cells were left to grow for 2
weeks. Colonies (foci) were visualized after being stained
with MTT for 4h. Pictures of the colonies were taken under
light microscope, and total colony number was determined
for each well by ImageJ software [42]. Three independent
experiments were done for each cell type.

Wound healing assay
The total of 3×104 cells (80% confluence) were plated
within each of the two cell culture reservoirs separated by
a 500 μm thick silicone wall (IBIDI, Milano, Italy). Day
after, the silicone insert was removed from the surface
and treatments with entrectinib or DMSO vehicle were
performed on four different human NB cell lines. The cells
were allowed to grow for another 48-72h, and images were
taken every 24h. Images were taken by Nikon Eclipse
TS100 microscope (NiKon Eclipse TS 100, Southern Micro
Instruments, Marietta, GA) with a Nikon Coolpix camera
attached to the microscope. Wound healing was analyzed
by MyWim software provided by IBIDI [41] for each time
point. Data were presented as percentage of scratch area
obtained for 3 separate measurements as mean ± SEM.

Cell cycle analysis
Analysis of cell cycle was done by flow cytometry.
NB cells were seeded in 6 wells plate at an initial density
of 8×105 cells per well. Cells were left to adhere before
being treated with entrectinib. At the end of treatment
(24h), the cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed,
fixed after centrifugation in 2ml of 70% Ethanol and left
at -20°C until analysis. After DNA staining by Propidium
iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) in addition of RNase (Qiagen,
Milan, Italy) for 30 min at room temperature in the
dark, the cell-cycles of the samples were measured on
a FACScalibur cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). Analysis was performed with the CellQuest
software, and presented as percentage of the cells in each
phase of cell-cycle (G1, S and G2/M).

Western blot analysis
Samples containing 100 μg of total proteins (for
ALK detection), or 50 μg (for proteins other than ALK)
were lysed with commercially available lysis buffer
(Biosource International; Camarillo, CA), and analyzed
with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) using precast gradient polyacrylamide gels (BioRad, Milano, Italy). Separated proteins were transferred
onto PVDF membranes, by using a semidry transfer cell
(BioRad, Trans-blot SD), and blocked with 5 % BSA in
1xPBS for 1h at room temperature. The membranes were
probed with monoclonal antibody, at a dilution suggested
by the manufacturer, overnight at 4°C. Following primary
antibodies were used: anti-PARP, anti-ERK1/2, antipERK1/2, anti-STAT3, anti-pSTAT3, and anti-pALK
