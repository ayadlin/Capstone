ABSTRACT
DNAzymes are a novel class of gene suppressors that selectively bind to an
RNA substrate by Watson-Crick base pairing and cleave phosphodiester bonds. To
explore the potential for therapeutic use of catalytic DNA molecules, active DNAzymes
targeting the bcl-xL gene were generated through a multiplex in vitro selection. The
DNAzyme-mediated down-regulation of the bcl-xL expression was demonstrated in
various cancer cell lines by Western blots. Treatment of the cells with the active
DNAzyme led to increases in percentage of apoptotic cells and cytochrome c release
from mitochondria, a hall marker of apoptosis. When combined with chemotherapeutics
such as Taxol, the DNAzyme significantly sensitised a panel of cancer cells to apoptosis
as measured by cell survival assay. In Taxol-resistant cells, down-regulation of bcl-xL
expression by the DNAzyme reversed the chemo-resistant phenotype of the cancer
cells. In a xenograft mouse model, the DNAzyme was delivered into the tumors via
an ALZET osmotic pump and shown to chemosensitize PC3 tumor when treating with
Taxol. The results from the present study demonstrate that bcl-xL DNAzyme treatment
facilitates apoptosis in solid tumors and suggest the potential use of bcl-xL DNAzyme
in combination with chemotherapeutics for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

indicating that these molecules may have a role in raising
the apoptotic threshold in a broad spectrum of cancerous
disorders. Expression of Bcl-xL in the NCI 60 cell lines
strongly correlated with resistance to most chemotherapy
agents [4]. It has been suggested that a decrease in Bcl‑xL
levels or the inhibition of Bcl‑xL activity might provoke
apoptosis or at least sensitise cells to apoptotic death. In
the absence of a clearly defined biochemical mechanism
of action or activity for this family of cell‑death regulatory
proteins (for which conventional inhibitors could therefore
be developed), gene therapy and antisense approaches
have become a reasonable alternative. For example,
antisense oligonucleotides to bcl‑xL have been shown to
be active in down‑regulation of the bcl‑xL expression,

Apoptosis is a complex process resulting in the
regulated destruction of a cell, which plays a major role
in normal development, cellular response to injury and
carcinogenesis [1]. It has been suggested that apoptosis
is one of the major mechanisms of cell death in response
to cancer therapy [2]. The Bcl‑2 family of proteins are
among the most studied molecules in the apoptotic
pathway. In this gene family, some are apoptosis inducers,
including, bax, bak, bcl‑Xs, bad, bid, bik and hrk, and
others, such as bcl‑2, bcl‑XL, bcl‑w, bfl‑1, brag‑1, Mcl‑1
and A1 are apoptosis suppressors [3]. Bcl‑2 or bcl-xL
levels are elevated in a broad range of human cancers,

leading to an increased chemosensitivity in a range of
cancer cells [5].
An ideal oligonucleotide-based gene inactivation
agent targeting RNA would combine the self-sufficient
RNA digestion capability, such as “hammerhead” and
“hairpin” ribozymes, with the relative biological resilience
of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Although
DNA molecules with RNA cleavage activity have not
been observed in nature, some have been derived as a
result of an artificial evolutionary system known as in
vitro selection [6-9]. In an in vitro selection system, DNA
liberated from its complementary strand is free to explore
a full range of structural possibilities, some of which have
been found to be capable of catalytic activity, including
site specific RNA cleavage and ligation [10, 11]. The 1023 DNA enzyme or DNAzyme was named from its origin
as the 23rd clone characterised from the 10th cycle of in
vitro selection [10]. This enzyme has a number of features,
which endow it with tremendous potential for applications
both in vitro and in vivo. These include its ability to cleave
almost any RNA sequence with high specificity provided
it contains a purine-pyrimidine dinucleotide. This can be
accomplished at very high kinetic efficiency with rates
approaching and even exceeding those of other nucleic
acid and protein endoribonucleases [10]. The ability of
the 10-23 DNAzyme to specifically cleave RNA with
high efficiency under simulated physiological conditions

has fuelled expectation that this agent may have useful
biological application in a gene inactivation strategy
[12-16]. Recent studies showed promising clinical
efficacy of the DNAzymes targeting c-jun and EBVencoded oncogene for treating various cancers [17, 18],
which demonstrated the feasibility to use DNAzymes as
therapeutics.
Here, we identified an active DNAzyme against the
bcl-xL gene by a multiplex selection. This DNAzyme was
shown to effectively down-regulate the Bcl-xL expression
in a range of cancer cells, thus overcome the anti-apoptotic
block and sensitized the cancer cells to chemotherapy in
xenograft animal models.

RESULTS
Identification of Cleavable sites in bcl‑xL mRNA.
DNAzymes were designed based on “10-23”
model (Fig 1A). A bcl‑xL cDNA clone (926 bp) was
produced from the RNA sample of PC3 cells and used for
screening the potential cleavable sites of DNAzymes. By
bioinformatics analysis, 81 potential AU or GU sites were
found and subjected to analyses on the thermodynamic
stability of the enzyme‑substrate heteroduplex as predicted
by the hybridisation free energy [19]. DNAzymes with

the greatest heteroduplex stability indicated by a low
free energy of hybridisation (calculated using the nearest
neighbour method), was often found to have the greatest
kinetic activity. As a result, 26 DNAzymes with ∆ G°<- 16
kcal/mol were chosen for the further multiplex cleavage
assay (sTable 1).
In order to select active DNAzymes, in vitro
selection was performed using a multiplex method,
which enables a pool of DNAzymes to be screened for
their ability to access and cleave RNA substrate under
simulated physiological conditions [20]. Based on the
bioinformatics and physiochemical analyses as shown
in sTable 1, twenty-six DNAzymes (0nM, 5nM, 50nM
and 500nM) and RNA substrate (400nM) were incubated
for cleavage reaction and primer extension was then
performed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase to
define the cleavage sites within the bcl-xL transcript.
The sequencing ladders were used as a guide to attribute
cleavage bands to specific DNAzymes. The relative
cleavage strength of each DNAzyme was determined by
intensity of the cleavage products. A representative gel
was shown in Fig 1B. DNAzymes were ranked according
to their cleavage ability at lowest concentration (5nM).The
multiplex selection resulted in 10 active DNAzymes that

could efficiently cleave the bcl-xL mRNA (sTable 1).

Chemical modification of DNAzymes
To increase DNAzyme stability in cells, 1-5
phosphorothioate (PS) linkages were incorporated into
each of the arms in DNAzyme (PS‑Dz, DT882). The
DNAzymes’ stability in human serum was significantly
improved with the increase of number of PS linkages (Fig
2A). To examine if the modification had any impact on
DNAzyme’s catalytic activity, we further performed a
single turnover kinetic analysis of the modified DNAzyme.
As shown in Fig 2B, the PS modification had decreased
the cleavage efficiency (kobs) of the modified DNAzymes,
compared with the unmodified one. To strike a balance
between the stability and catalytic activity, we selected the
3+3 PS modification scheme for the further cell and in
vivo studies.

Effect of bcl‑xL DNAzymes on bcl‑xL expression
Using the modified version of 16 DNAzymes
derived from the multiplex selection, we performed
further testing for their ability to down regulate the
bcl‑xL expression in cells. The assays were performed
in PC3 cells (a prostate cancer cell line). After screening
all 16 DNAzymes, three DNAzymes (DT 882, DT883,
and DT884) exhibited a very strong inhibitory effect on
bcl‑xL protein expression as shown in a representative gel
(Figure 3A). An antisense control (ctggatccaaggctctaggt)
and a negative control (scrambled arms of DT882,
tggtgtgtgggctagctacaacgagttaataaa) were used in the
screening. Based on the results of in vitro cell screening,
we next selected one of the most active DNAzyme
DT882 for further validation of its activity of downregulation of bcl-xL expression in a panel of cancer cell
lines (PC3, prostate cancer; T24, bladder cancer; A549,
lung carcinoma; CNE-1, nasopharyngeal carcinoma;
HCT116, colon cancer). Figures 3B showed that antibcl-xL DNAzyme DT882 reduced the level of the bcl-xL
gene expression in the cell lines tested, which indicated
that DT882 could be effectively transfected into the cells,
found its target mRNA and inhibited bcl-xL expression
in cells.

Having shown the DT882 inhibition of bcl-xL
expression in cancer cells, its effect on apoptosis of PC3
cells was further examined. In the assay, same transfection
procedure as in Western blotting assay was used, except
those cells were subject to Annexin-V staining after the
overnight incubation with the DNAzyme. Fig 4A clearly

showed that there was a substantial increase in apoptosis
population in the DNAzyme treated cells (23.17%),
as compared with the control-treated (an inactivated
DNAzyme with scrambled arm sequences of DT882 ),
indicating that the cells treated with the bcl‑xL DNAzyme
was provoked to undergo apoptosis. To determine
the effect of bcl-xL DNAzyme on the early events of
apoptosis caused by down-regulation of bcl-xL, the
measurement of Cytochrome C release from the cells was
performed. As shown in Figure 4B, DNAzyme-mediated
reduction of bcl-xL in PC3 cells led to an increased release
of Cytochrome C. This result not only confirmed the data
from FACS analysis, but also validated the specificity of
the DNAzyme in induction of apoptosis via mitochondria

pathway in PC3 cells.

Chemosensitization of Cancer Cells with anti-bclxL DNAzyme
The Bcl-xL protein has been shown in a number
of cell lines as a potent protector of cellular apoptosis
induced by anti-neoplastic agents. To examine if DT882
could sensitise cancer cells to the effect of cytotoxic
chemotherapy by down-regulating bcl-xL expression,
cell survival was measured using MTS assays in a panel
of cancer cells treated with either the DNAzyme alone
or DNAzyme plus anti-cancer agent Taxol. The results
showed that the anti-bcl-xL DNAzyme DT882 sensitised
all the cancer cells to Taxol treatment (Table 1). This
sensitization led to about 150~260% increase of cell death
in a range of cancer cell lines treated with DT882 plus
Taxol, compared with that treated with Taxol alone. To
examine if DT882 could reverse the Taxol-resistance,
a Taxol-resistant cell line CNE2R (nasopharyngeal

carcinoma) were assayed for possible drug resistance
reversal. As shown in Figure 4C, while the Taxol treatment
in a range of concentrations did not cause cell death of the
resistant cells or the control-treated resistant cells, DT882
treated resistant cells showed a significant reduction in cell
survival, indicating that down-regulation of the bcl-xL in
the Taxol-resistant cells could restore the cellular response
to the chemotherapeutics.

In order to demonstrate if DNAzyme-mediated
down-regulation of the bcl-xL expression resulted in

xenograft was used to determine the sensitivity to the
chemotherapeutic. In the experiments, seven groups of
mice (8 mice per group) (Saline, DNAzyme, AS, Control,
Taxol, Taxol + DNAzyme, and Taxol + AS ) were
employed. When tumours reached an average volume of
100-200 mm3, an Alzet osmotic pump, which was used
as a delivery vehicle for DNAzyme oligonucleotide in
tumour bearing mice, was surgically implanted in the
peritoneum of the mouse via the abdominal route. As
shown in Fig 5A, the combinational use of DT882 and
Taxol markedly inhibited PC3 tumour growth compared
with the groups of DNAzyme alone, Taxol alone or control
plus Taxol.
To examine the in vivo stability of the DNAzyme
and the pump delivery efficiency, the DNAzyme
oligonucleotide was extracted from the tumor tissues,
plasma and the remaining solution of the pumps in the
mice treated with DT882 plus Taxol (day 14), and labelled
with γ--32P-ATP. Analysis showed that the DNAzyme was
stable over the treatment period and the Alzet osmotic
pump provided a consistent delivery of the DNAzyme in
vivo (Fig 5B).

tumor, permitting continuous, controlled dosing, thus
enabling us to achieve steady state conditions and accurate
delivery of the DNAzyme over prolonged periods of time
and to show a significant effect of chemosensitization by
the DNAzyme to Taxol treatment.
To date, there have been substantial amount of
preclinical and clinical studies in search for the inhibitors
of Bcl-2 family, among which one Bcl-2 antisense and
three small molecule inhibitors are being tested in clinical
trials [23, 24]. However, it has been well recognized that
the agents with high specificity tend to induce cancer
drug resistance, while broader acting agents could cause
unwanted toxicity. Considering that the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family is a large and redundant family of proteins, some
of which have been shown to contribute to drug resistance
in cancer cells [25, 26], inhibition of multiple Bcl-2 family
members would be necessary in order to optimize the
therapeutic effect. Importantly, previous studies showed
that paclitaxel (Taxol) causes phosphorylation and
inactivation of Bcl-2 [31-34]. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2
takes place only during mitotic arrest and the duration of
the arrest is important for cell killing by paclitaxel/Taxol
[35, 36]. However, Bcl-2 can be substituted by Bcl-xL
[37], which underscores the importance to decrease BclxL levels in Taxol-treated cells. This decrease actually
increases sensitivity to Taxol as now shown by current
work. Thus, our strategy further confirm that one antiapoptotic protein can be substituted by the other, providing
evidence that the Taxol resistance can be overcome by
targeting Bcl-xL.
In conclusion, we present a novel agent that
catalytically cleave the Bcl-xL mRNA, one of the
important members of Bcl-2 family, thus add another
candidate of inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family with
new mechanisms for potential multimodality treatment of
cancers.

DISCUSSION
DNAzymes have been shown to effectively suppress
gene expression both in vitro and in vivo [21]. Limited
therapeutic efficacy has been demonstrated in patients in
studies targeting c-jun and EBV-LMP1 [17, 18]. In the
present report, we present a comprehensive study in which
an active DNAzyme targeting bcl-xL gene was identified
and validated through in vitro selection to in vivo testing,
showing clear experimental evidence that the Bcl-xL
DNAzyme could be an effective chemo-adjuvant agent
for potential clinical applications in cancer chemotherapy.
Targeting a DNAzyme to a particular mRNA is
generally a multi-step process. In our previous study, a
multiplex selection approach was devised to facilitate the
selection of the accessible sites for DNAzymes within the
target mRNA [20], but only at the in vitro level. Here, we
successfully applied this methodology and further proved
that there was a consistency between the in vitro cleavage
activity and in vivo efficacy of the DNAzymes. Thus, our
study provided a streamline approach to therapeutic uses
of DNAzymes.
Despite the range of anti-cancer studies using
nucleic acid-based agents, one common factor necessary
for the success of therapeutic uses of those agents is the
ability to delivery of the agents in a precise and dependable
manner. The antitumor effects of the therapeutic agents are
influenced by schedule of drug administration. In majority
of the studies testing anti-cancer oligonucleotides, intratumoral injection has been the method of the choice to
deliver oligonucleotides [22], which was somewhat
invasive and less efficient. In this study, we surgically
implanted the ALZET osmotic pump adjacent to the

chloroform/ isoamyl alcohol. The RNA contained in the
aqueous phase could be used directly in the multiplex
cleavage reaction or precipitated in 0.3M sodium acetate
and two volumes of absolute ethanol.
Multiple DNAzyme oligonucleotides (0.5 nM0.5 µM) and synthetic RNA substrate (0.2 µM) were
pre-equilibrated separately for 10 min at 37oC in equal
volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2,
150 mM NaCl and 0.01 % SDS. The reaction was then
initiated by mixing the DNAzymes and substrate together.
After an hour the reactions were stopped by emersion in
ice and precipitation in 0.3 M sodium acetate and two
volumes of ethanol.
Primer extension analysis was then performed on
DNAzyme cleaved RNA using SuperScriptII reverse
transcriptase (Life Technologies). Two primers were
designed for the extension reactions along the bclxL RNA [PE1: GTTTCTCCTGGTGGCAATG; PE2:
CCATCCCGGAAGAGTTCA]. In each reaction 2 pmol
of 32P-labelled primer was combined with 400 nM of
RNA and denatured at 90oC for 5 min. For extension with
Superscript reverse transcriptase, the primer was allowed
to anneal slowly between 65oC and 45oC before adding
the 1st strand buffer, dithiothreitol, deoxyribonucleotides
and enzyme (according to the manufacturer’s instructions).
This mixture (final volume 20 µl) was then incubated for
1h at 45oC before being transferred to ice.
Sequencing fragments corresponding to each
segment of the target were also generated by primer
extension on the double stranded DNA template in
the presence of chain terminating dideoxynucleotides
(ddNTP). In these four reactions the dNTP concentration
was reduced to 2.5 µM while being supplemented by
either 10 µM ddGTP or 100 µM ddATP or 200 µM ddTTP
or 100 µM ddCTP in 16.6 mM(NH4)2SO4, 67 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.8), 6.7 mM MgCl2, 0.87 units of Taq DNA
polymerase and 1.0 pmol of the 32P-labelled primer. This
reaction was performed as a linear amplification over 25
temperature cycles at 95o C for 30 s, 60° C for 90 s, and
72° C for 60 s.
After primer extension, samples were combined
with an equal volume of stop buffer (formamide/EDTA/
loading dye) before electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing
polyacrylamide gel. The corresponding image could then
be revealed and the band intensity quantified at each
position with Phosphorimager and ImageQuant software
(Molecular Dynamics).

All the oligonucleotides were made by TriLink
BioTechnologies (San Diego, CA) and purified by gel
electrophoresis for in vitro studies and by HPLC for cellbased assays and in vivo studies.

Design and thermodynamic analysis of DNAzymes
DNAzyme sequences for each target are assembled
using the 10-23 catalytic motif [ggctagctacaacga] and
hybridising arms specific for each site along the target
RNA transcript (Fig. 1A). The length of each arm is
usually fixed at 9 bases; however, these can be shortened
or lengthened depending on their individual predicted
hybridisation free energy. Each DNAzyme oligonucleotide
is designed to target purine-uracil (RU). In most cases
we ignore purine-cytosine sites as in our experience
they are less reactive than RU sites, particularly AC
junctions [28]. The potential DNAzymes were subjected
to thermodynamic analyses (hybridization free energy and
Tm) [19].

Multiplex selection of active DNAzymes in vitro
DNAzyme target site selection was described
previously [20]. Briefly, linear template DNA
for the production of the bcl-xL transcript was
prepared by PCR in a mixture containing 10 pM
cDNA, 1 µM of the forward T7 phage promoter
primer
[TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAAGATTCTGAAGGGAGAG] and 1 µM of the reverse
primer [CGGGTTTCTCCTGGTGGCAATG]. The
reaction was carried out over 25 temperature cycles
at 95oC for 30 s, 60oC for 90 s, and 72oC for 60 s in a
solution containing 16.6 mM (NH4)2SO4, 67 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.8), 6.7 mM MgCl2, 0.87 units of AmpliTaq
DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer) and 300 µM each
of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, dCTP. PCR products were
electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel alongside appropriate
size/ mass standards and visualised by ethidium
fluorescence. The illuminated amplicon bands were then
excised from the agarose slab and extracted using Gene
Clean (Bio 101). Template DNA was then redissolved in
diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated RNase free water
and the concentration adjusted to approximately 100ng.

For RNA transcription, reaction was performed with
100 ng of purified template DNA and T7 RNA polymerase
at 37oC for 3 h using an RNA transcription kit (Epicentre).
After the 3 hour incubation the DNA template was
degraded by the addition of 1 MBU of RNase-free DNase
I and further 15 min incubation at 37oC. This reaction was
then terminated by adding an equal volume of phenol/

at a final concentration of 10 µM in 100% human AB

24 and 48 hours and diluted in 290 µl of 10 mM Tris/1
mM EDTA, pH 8.0, buffer (TE buffer). The diluted
DNAzyme was extracted by sequentially adding 150 µl
phenol and 150 µl chloroform with vortexing. Samples
were centrifuged at 11,300g for 10 minutes, and 100
µl supernatant was collected. Aliquots of the aqueous
supernatant were labeled with 32P and electrophoresed
on a 16% polyacrylamide gel. Labeled DNAzyme bands
were quantified using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant
software (Sunnyvale, CA), and the recovered DNAzyme
was expressed as a percentage of the DNAzyme diluted
directly into TE buffer.
The in vitro activity of DNAzymes was determined
by measuring the rate of RNA cleavage under single
turnover condition. The 32P-labelled RNA transcripts to
be used in the cleavage reaction were produced utilising
the RNA transcription kit (Epicentre). The transcripts were
electrophoresed on a 16% denaturing PAGE and bands
were excised and gel purified. The observed constant (kobs)
is the rate of cleavage and it was calculated by regression
analysis of the progress curve using the following
equation:
[P] = [P]∞(1 - e-1kobst)
where [P] is the cleavage yield, [P∞] is the final
cleavage yield, and t is the reaction time [29]. Cleavage
reactions were performed over multiple time points.

was detected with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horse
radish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies
(Santa Cruz). This binding was visualized with the ECL
western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, England) on exposure to chemiluminescent film.

Apoptosis and cell survival assays
To determine apoptosis induced by DNAzymes,
Annexin-V-FUOS Kit was used to detect apoptotic cells
by FACS, according to the manufacturer’s instruction
(Roche). Apoptotic cells were quantified using a FACScan
flow cytometer (Becton–Dickinson).
Chemosensitization effect of DNAzymes on cancer
cells was examined using MTS assay. Cancer cells were
treated with DNAzyme/TMP complex for 4 hours. The
medium was then replaced with fresh DMEM containing
10% FBS and 100 nM Taxol, and further incubated for 72
hours. MTS assays were performed for cell viability of all
the samples.

Detection of cytosolic Cytochrome C expression
in PC3 cells
Transfected cells were harvested by centrifugation at
200 g for 5 minutes at 4° C. The cell pellets were washed
once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
resuspended with 5 volume of buffer containing 20 mM
HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5; 10 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl2; 1
mM sodium EDTA; 0.1% SDS; 1 mM dithiothreitol; and
0.1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride containing 250
mM sucrose. The cells were homogenized with a 22-gauge
needle, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 1000g
for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove nuclei, unbroken cells,
and large membrane fragments. The supernatant was
centrifuged once more at 10,000g at 4 °C for 30 min. The
supernatant cytosolic fraction was collected, quantitated
and used in Western analysis.

DNAzyme transfections
To
facilitate
delivery
of
DNAzyme
oligonucleotides into cells, a cationic porphyrin, tetra
meso (4‑methylpyridyl) porphyrin (TMP), was used as a
transfection reagent for intracellular delivery [30]. Briefly,
0.8 x 105 cells were seeded in a 60‑mm culture dish and
incubated at 37oC, 5% CO2 overnight. DNAzyme and
control molecules were transfected into cells with TMP at
a charge ratio of 3. The final concentration of DNAzyme in
the transfection mix was 2 µM in 2 ml of medium without
serum. After 4 hours, the cells were replaced with fresh
culture medium. Twenty-four hours after transfection,
the cells were harvested for Western blot and cell biology
analyses.

In vivo mouse model and DNAzyme treatment
Four-week-old female Balb/C nude mice were
obtained from the Animal Resources Center (Perth,
Australia) and were housed and maintained in compliance
with the National Health and Medical Research
Council Statement on Animal Experimentation and the
requirements of the New South Wales State legislation.
Four groups of mice (8 mice per group) (Saline,
DNAzyme, Taxol, Taxol + DNAzyme) were employed.
At day 1: acclimatised nude male Balb/C athymic mice
were injected with 1x 106 PC3 cells suspended in 0.1
ml Matrigel in the right hind leg under methoxyfluorane
anesthesia. Tumour growth was measured twice weekly
using digital callipers and tumour volume is calculated

Western analysis
Protein was extracted from the transfected cells in
RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%
SDS, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.57 mM
PMSF and 1 µg/ml aprotinin). Protein samples (40 µg)
were run on 12% SDS-PAGE gels (BioRad), transferred to
nylon membranes and immunoblotted with the following
antibodies: anti Bcl-xL mouse monoclonal antibody (H5, Santa Cruz), anti-Cytochrome C rabbit polyclonal
antibody (H-104, Santa Cruz) and anti-β-actin monoclonal
antibody (AC-74, Sigma). Binding of primary antibodies

using the (l * w * h* π/6) formula. When tumours reached
an average volume of 100-200 mm3, an Alzet osmotic
pump (BioScientific), which was used as a delivery vehicle
for DNAzyme oligonucleotide in tumour bearing mice,
was surgically implanted in the peritoneum of the mouse
via the abdominal route. The Alzet model1002 pump is
a capsule shaped pump (1.5 x 0.6 cm) and delivered a
total volume of 0.5 ml at a rate of 0.25 µl/hr over a period
of 14 days. The pump was filled with a saline solution
containing DNAzyme oligonucleotide, which resulted
in a dose rate of 12.5 mg/kg/d. Some mice received
sub-optimal doses of 25 mg/kg Taxol by intraperitoneal
route in a 200µl injection once weekly post-surgery for
the duration of the study. At the end of 14d, mice were
euthanized by cervical dislocation and tumours harvested.
Tumours were weighed, snap-frozen and stored at
–80oC till analysis. To analyse the concentration of the
DNAzyme, the DNAzyme oligonucleotide was extracted
from tumor tissue, plasma and remaining solution in the
pumps with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with
ethanol. The extracted DNAzyme was labelled with γ-32PATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and assayed on PAGE.
