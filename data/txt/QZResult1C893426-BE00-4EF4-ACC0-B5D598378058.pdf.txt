BACKGROUND. Sensitivity of tumor cells to induction of apoptosis by proteasome
inhibitors varies greatly. This study was undertaken to investigate the sensitivity
of neoplastic B cells and solid tumor cells to proteasome inhibition with respect

to constitutive expression levels of proteasome subunits.
METHODS. Twelve neoplastic B-cell lines and 12 solid tumor cell lines were
assessed for their expression levels of proteasome subunits by using quantitative
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and were assessed for
their sensitivity to the proteasome inhibitors PS-341 and lactacystin by using a
flow cytometry assay that detected activated caspases.

RESULTS. The neoplastic B-cell lines were categorized into 3 groups representing

sensitivity. Correlating expression levels of proteasome subunits with sensitivity
to proteasome inhibition indicated that refractory B cells exhibited lower expresLMP2 compared with sensitive B cell lines. Compared with neoplastic B cells
solid tumor cells were less sensitive. They expressed the immunoproteasome
subunits LMP2, LMP7 and MECL-1 and the standard subunit b2 clearly below
the median of the expression level of the sensitive B cell lines. IFN-g pretreatment enhanced sensitivity to PS-341 in 50% of the tumor cell lines, potentially
related to the induction of immunoproteasomes.

CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study indicated that sensitivity to proteasome
inhibition is correlated with expression levels of proteasome subunits, which
determine the enzymatic activity of the proteasome. Combining PS-341 with
IFN-g may enhance its clinical efficacy. Cancer 2008;112:659–70.  2008 American

he ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a critical role in cellular
homeostasis and contribute to the degradation of multiple proteins, including those implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.1 The 26S proteasomes are
multicatalytic protease complexes comprised of a 20S catalytic core
and a regulatory 19S subunit. The proteolytic activities are located
in the 20S core particle. Three active enzymatic subunits have been
identified and have been characterized as chymotryptic-like (b5),
tryptic-like (b1), and postglytamyl-peptidylhydrolytic-like (or postacidic [b2]). These subunits can be replaced by their interferon g
(IFNg)-inducible counterparts LMP2, LMP7, and MECL-1, resulting
in alternatively assembled immunoproteasomes.2,3 It is believed that

immunoproteasomes possess enhanced proteolytic
activity and are expressed constitutively by professional antigen-presenting cells, including B-cells.4
Inhibition of the proteasome leads to apoptosis
and has emerged as a new therapeutic approach for
cancer therapy.5,6 The boronic acid derivate PS-431
reversibly inhibits the chymotryptic activity, which is
the most important activity of the proteasome. PS341 has an approved clinical indication for relapsed
and refractory multiple myeloma, and Phase II trials
in several malignancies in combination regimens
with chemotherapeutic agents are ongoing.7,8 However, there is evidence from both in vitro and in vivo
studies of the variable sensitivity of neoplastic cells
for the induction of apoptosis by PS-341 and other
proteasome inhibitors.9 Several factors that can
replace the function of the proteasome are being discussed with an emphasis on the activation of alternative proteolytic pathways, like activation of the
protease tripeptidylpeptidase II (TPPII).10,11 An alternative mechanism, which may influence the sensitivity to PS-341, could be related to differences in the
expression levels and composition of proteasome
subunits that determine proteasomal activity.
Herein, we address this question by correlating
the sensitivity of tumor cells to proteasome inhibition with the expression levels of proteasome subunits. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of tumor
cell lines to proteasome inhibition was associated
with the expression patterns and expression levels of
the subunits. In line with this observation, we established that the induction of immunoproteasome subunits by pretreatment with IFN-g resulted in a
potentially clinically relevant augmentation of sensitivity to proteasome inhibition, even in resistant cell
lines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and Reagents
All human cell lines (DG75, RAJI, EHEB, SKW3,
AMO-1, U266, RPMI 8226, KARPAS422, KARPAS1106P, SU-DHL-4, GRANTA519, JEKO-1, Colo320,
CaCo2, SW480, SW620, MelHo, SkMel5, SkMel24,
MDA-MB435S, T47D, 8505C, TT2960-CO2, and
Calu-6) were purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig,
Germany) or American TypeCulture Collection (Baltimore, Md). Cells were maintained in RPMI-1640
that contained 10% to 20% fetal calf serum, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2% glutamine (Gibco,
Karlsruhe, Germany).
The proteasome inhibitor PS-341 (Velcade1) was
purchased from Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.
(Cambridge, Mass). Lactacystin was purchased from

Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). The proteasome inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
as a stock solution, stored at 2208C, and subsequently diluted 1:1000 in serum-free RPMI 1640
before use. IFN-g (Imukin1) was purchased from
Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany).

Assessment of Apoptosis
Tumor cells (1 3 106 growing cells in log phase)
were incubated with proteasome inhibitors (final
DMSO concentration, <0.01%). After 12 hours, if
not specified otherwise, tumor cells were resuspended in 200 lL medium and incubated for 20
minutes at 378C with CaspACEFITC-VAD-FMK in
situ marker (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), which
specifically binds activated caspases. After 2 washing steps with phosphate-buffered saline, propidium
iodide (PI) (Sigma) was added. The samples were
kept on ice and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells
that were negative for caspases and PI were classified as viable cells. Cells that were positive only for
caspases represented early apoptotic cells, cells that
were positive for caspases and for PI represented
late apoptotic cells, and cells that were positive only
for PI represented necrotic cells.

Affinity Labeling of Active Proteasomes
The proteasome-specific affinity probe Bodipy
TMR-Ahx3L3VS (MV151) was synthesized as described previously.12 For proteasome labeling of
intact cells, 5 3 106 cells were incubated with
MV151 5 lM in complete medium at 378C for 2
hours. Then, cells were washed in 0.9% NaCl and
lysed in 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 minutes, followed by the removal of debris and membrane fractions by centrifugation. Total protein content in cell
lysates was determined by using the Bradford
method, and samples were adjusted for equal total
protein with IEF-buffer (9 M urea, 4% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate, 0.5% Pharmalyte [all from GE Healthcare], and
0.4% dithiothrietol [DTT]). IPG-strips, from pH 3 to
pH 10 (Invitrogen, the Netherlands), were rehydrated with the samples overnight, followed by isoelectric focusing using the Ettan IPG-multiphor
device (GE Healthcare). Consecutively, strips were
reduced in DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and
resolved by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a 1-dimensional
sample was put at the anode side of the strip as an
internal control. The gels were observed on an FLA5100 fluorescence scanner (Fuji).

Analysis of Expression of Proteasome Subunits by
Reverse Transccriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Tumor cells growing in log phase were resuspended
in guanidium thiocyanate buffer and stored at
2808C. Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy
Mini Kit, including the RNase-Free DNase Set
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA integrity was
checked electrophoretically and was quantified spectrophotometrically. For reverse transcription, 2 lg
RNA were diluted in 15 lL RNase-free water, incubated for 5 minutes at 658C, and placed on ice. A
7.5-lL mixture that contained 1 lL oligo-p(dT)15
primer (0.8 lg/lL), 1 lL random primer p(dN)6
primer (0.2 ng/lL), 2 lL dinucleotide triphosphate
(5 mM), 0.5 lL RNase Inhibitor (40 U/lL), Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase (4.5 U/lL), and 2 lL
reverse transcriptase (RT) buffer (310) was added to
the RNA. After incubation at 378C for 1 hour, Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase was inactivated for 5
minutes at 958C, and combinational DNA (cDNA)
was stored at 2208C.
Quantitative real-time RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with LightCycler Technology (Roche Diagnostics). Two microliters of each
cDNA were diluted to a volume of 20 lL PCR mix
(LightCycler Fast Start DNA Master Hybridization
Probes; Roche Diagnostics) that contained the appropriate MgCl2 concentration, 0.5 pmol of each primer,
and 0.2 pmol of each probe. Primer and probe
sequences were designed by using the LightCycler
Probe Design software, version 1.0, and are listed in
Table 1. Target-specific, final MgCl2 concentrations
also are listed in Table 1. For each target, an initial
denaturation cycle at 958C for 10 minutes was followed by 50 cycles of the following sequences: for porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), 0 seconds at 958C,
12 seconds at 658C and 10 seconds at 728C; for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
0 seconds at 958C, 12 seconds at 638C, and 10 seconds
at 728C; for b1, b2, b5, and LMP2, 0 seconds at 958C,
12 seconds at 608C, and 10 seconds at 728C; for LMP7,
0 seconds at 958C, 12 seconds at 558C, and 10 seconds
at 728C; for MECL-1, 0 seconds at 958C, 10 seconds at
628C, and 10 seconds at 728C. After 50 cycles, those
sequences were followed by a final extension for
2 minutes at 728C.
The specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by melting curve analysis as well as by gel
electrophoresis. For quantification, PCR products
generated from the proteasome subunit cDNAs and
from the housekeeping genes PBGD and GAPDH
cDNAs were cloned into the vector pCR2.1-TOPO
(Invitrogen). A standard curve with 3 dilutions of the

each PCR run.

Data Analysis/Statistical Analysis
Analysis of RT-PCR expression data was done with
the LightCycler software (version 3). Crossing points
(Cp) (the beginning of the PCR exponential phase)
were assessed by using the second derivate maximum algorithm and were plotted against the concentrations of the standards. Sample concentrations
were calculated by using the plasmid standard curve
resulting in proteasome subunit concentrations. All
samples were analyzed in duplicate. The average
value of both duplicates was used as a quantitative
value. To correct for differences in cDNA amounts on
a per-sample basis, results were provided as the ratio
to housekeeping gene PBGD expression. For correlating expression levels with response to apoptosis, the
expression data were analyzed by using MeV software.13 All functional experiments were done in
duplicate under similar conditions (growing cells in
log phase, last media change 2 days before). Results
were presented as mean values. In 90% of experiments, values did not vary >10% around the mean
value. Gene expression studies and viability studies
were done at different times but under similar conditions.

RESULTS
Sensitivity of Lymphoma and Myeloma Cell Lines
to Proteasome Inhibition
Nine lymphoma cell lines and 3 myeloma cell lines
were incubated with increasing concentrations of PS341. There was a strong dose-dependent effect on
apoptosis induction by PS-341 (Fig. 1A). The cell
lines exhibited considerable variation in susceptibility to proteasome inhibition. With the exception of
the Burkitt lymphoma cell lines DG75 and RAJI,
which were refractory, no entity-specific sensitivity
pattern was observed. With respect to the concentration of PS-341 required to induce apoptosis after 12
hours of incubation, the cell lines were categorized
into 3 groups: Group I represents 3 refractory cell
lines that exhibited no significant reduction of cell
viability at any concentration of PS-341. Cell lines in
Group II demonstrated moderate apoptosis induction. Cell viability was reduced up to 45% of
untreated control cells at 10 nM PS-341 because of
the induction of early apoptotic cells. Cells that were
included in Group III were highly sensitive and
exhibited a reduction in viability to <30% at 10 nM
PS-341. In the KARPAS1106P cells, only early apoptotic cells were observed, and the cell lines JEKO-1 and

bation. Values are expressed as the percentage of viability of control samples that contained no inhibitor. (A) Percentage reduction of cell viability by
PS-341. (B) Percentage reduction of cell viability by lactacystin.

SKW3 also exhibited a significant increase in late apoptotic cells. A significant increase in necrotic cells
was not observed. The different susceptibility of the
tumor cell lines to apoptosis induction by proteasome inhibition was confirmed by incubation with a
second, specific proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin.
Comparable results were obtained with the exception
of the cell line EHEB, which appeared to be slightly
more sensitive to proteasome inhibition by lactacystin compared with PS-341 (Fig. 1B).

Sensitivity of Solid Tumor Cell Lines to Proteasome
Inhibition by PS-341
Twelve solid tumor cell lines (colon carcinoma, melanoma, breast cancer, and thyroid carcinoma cell
lines) were incubated with increasing concentrations
of PS-341. After 12 hours of incubation, no apoptosis
induction was observed. After 24 hours of incubation, no or only moderate, dose-dependent apoptosis
induction was observed (Fig. 2). With respect to the

concentration of PS-341 required to induce apoptosis
after 24 hours of incubation, the cell lines were categorized into 2 groups: Group I represented cell lines
that exhibited <20% reduction of cell viability at
10 nM PS-341 without any further significant increase
in apoptosis induction at higher concentrations. Cells
of Group II demonstrated moderate apoptosis induction at 10 nM concentration of PS-341 to <80% of
untreated control cells. There was no entity-specific
sensitivity. The most sensitive cell line was the melanoma cell line MelHo, which exhibited a reduction in
viability to <60% of the viability in untreated control
cells at 10 nM PS-341 and to 31% at 40 nM PS-341.
In contrast to the neoplastic B cells, none of the cell
lines was highly sensitive. In all cell lines, only early
apoptotic cells were observed.

I) exhibited the lowest expression levels of the standard proteasome subunit b2, which may impair formation of standard proteasomes. 2) The refractory
cell lines exhibited an expression level of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP2 that was below the median expression level of all cell lines. 3) Furthermore,
all cell lines that had an expression level of the
immunoproteasome subunit MECL-1 below the median expression level of all cell lines belonged to the
refractory and intermediate sensitive cell lines. Low
expression of both MECL-1 and LMP2 subunits may
impair the assembly of immunoproteasomes. Thus,
different sensitivity to proteasome inhibition was
associated with a specific expression pattern of proteasome subunits. This association was confirmed
by using a pattern-recognition algorithm (Fig. 3B).
Unsupervised analysis revealed 2 main clusters that
represented the refractory cell lines of Group I and
the intermediate and highly sensitive cell lines of
Groups II and III, respectively.
To validate that the housekeeping gene PBGD is
transcribed constantly in all 12 B-cell lines, we determined the expression level of a second housekeeping
gene GAPDH and compared differences in the Cp
(DCp) of these housekeeping genes. The Cp is
defined as the number of cycles needed for the fluorescence to reach a specific threshold level of detection and is correlated inversely with the amount of
template nucleic acid present in the reaction. We
observed only minimal deviation of DCp values (median, 8.74; range, 7.59–10.78) in the different cell
lines, indicating that both housekeeping genes are
expressed relatively stably, because coregulation of
both genes is unlikely (Fig. 3C).

Proteasome Expression Levels and Subunit Composition
in B-cell Lines Influence Response to Proteasome
Inhibition
The 12 B-cell lines were assessed for their expression
levels of the standard proteasome subunits b1, b2,
and b5 and the immunoproteasome subunits LMP2,
LMP7, and MECL-1 by RT-PCR. To correct for differences of cDNA amount on a per-sample basis, results
were provided as ratio to housekeeping gene PBGD
expression. In all cell lines, specific messenger RNA
(mRNA) of the 3 standard proteasome subunits and
3 immunoproteasome subunits was detectable. However, the mRNA expression levels varied over 2 logs
for b1 and LMP7 and over 3 logs for b2, b5, LMP2,
and MECL-1 (Fig. 3A). Correlating expression levels
with response to apoptosis induction by PS-341
revealed the following observations: 1) Compared
with the intermediate (Group II) and highly sensitive
cell lines (Group III), the refractory cell lines (Group

Proteasome Subunit Composition in Assembled,
Active Proteasomes
The enzymatic subunits are synthesized as precursor
proteins that subsequently undergo autocatalytic
processing during proteasome maturation. During
assembly, certain combinations are favored over
others. We assessed the subunit composition of
active proteasomes in the 3 lymphoma cell lines
DG75, GRANTA519, and KARPAS442 and in the myeloma cell line U266 by using a novel, synthetic affinity tag that allows the detection of all catalytic
subunits in intact cells in an activity-dependent
fashion (Fig. 3D). Active species of all 3 of the
immunoproteasome subunits LMP2, LMP7, and
MECL-1, as observed in assembled immunoproteasomes, were detected in the cell line GRANTA519
and, to a lesser extent, in the cell line U266, but not
in DG75 or KARPAS442 cells. This corresponds to
the mRNA expression levels observed in these cell

lines: Only the GRANTA519 cell line exhibited sizable
mRNA expression levels of both MECL-1 and LMP2
subunits. Assembly of these subunits represents the
initial event in immunoproteasome formation. The
cell line U266 exhibited high amounts of active
LMP2 but little active MECL-1, which may impair
immunoproteasome assembly. The low mRNA
expression levels of LMP2 observed in the refractory
cell lines DG75 and KARPAS442 were reflected in the
lack of sizable activity of the respective immunoproteasome catalytic subunits in these cells and high
detectable activity of standard proteasome catalytic
subunits, although the b2 mRNA expression level
was low, as exhibited for the cell line DG75.

Low Expression Levels of Immunoproteasome Subunits
and of the Constitutive Subunit b2 in Solid Tumor Cells
Are Related to Low Sensitivity of Proteasome Inhibition
Like the B cells, the mRNA expression levels of the
standard proteasome subunits b1, b2, and b5 and
their corresponding immunoproteasome subunits
LMP2, MECL-1, and LMP7 were determined. In all
cell lines, specific mRNA for all assessed proteasome
subunits was detected.

The mRNA expression levels of standard proteasome subunits varied only slightly between the different solid tumor cell lines: over 1 log for b2
(median, 4.98, range, 1.84–24.4) and 2 logs for b1
(median, 5.28; range, 6.45 3 1021–88.85) and b5 (median, 2.67; range, 4.75 3 1021–19.82). In contrast, the
mRNA expression levels of immunoproteasome subunits varied over 2 logs for LMP2 (median, 0.42;
range, 1.17 3 1022–6.09), 3 logs for LMP7 (median,
1.04; range, 4.93 3 1023–4.45), and 5 logs for MECL1 (median, 0.55; range, 6.17 3 1025–2.7).
Comparison of the median expression level of
enzymatic, active proteasome subunits of lymphoma
and plasmocytoma cells with known sensitivity to
apoptosis induction by PS-341 (Group II and III)
with the median expression level of solid tumor cell
lines indicated that the less sensitive solid tumor cell
lines expressed all immunoproteasome subunits as
well as the constitutive subunit b2 clearly below the
median of the expression level of the sensitive B-cell
lines (Fig. 3E). Only the cell line MelHo, which
appears to be more sensitive to apoptosis induction
compared with the other solid tumor cell lines,
exhibited higher expression levels of all constitutive

Pretreatment with IFN-c Favors Immunoproteasome
Assembly
To modify the expression of immunoproteasome
subunits LMP2, LMP7, and MECL-1, the cell lines
were cultured in the presence of IFN-g. Proteasome
subunit expression was assessed by RT-PCR analysis.
In all B-cell lines, the mRNA expression level of
standard subunits decreased. In some cell lines, the
expression levels of immunoproteasome subunits
also were down-regulated. Regarding the ratios

immunoproteasome subunit/corresponding standard
proteasome subunit, with exception of the cell line
EHEB, in all cell lines, the ratio LMP2/b1 and/or the
ratio MECL-1/b2 increased (Fig. 4A). This likely
favors the assembly of immunoproteasomes that
contain the IFN-g-inducible subunits LMP2, LMP7,
and MECL-1. In contrast, in the cell line EHEB, the
ratios LMP2/b1 and MECL-1/b2 decreased. These
decreases may disfavor the assembly of immunoproteasomes.
In all solid tumor cells lines, mRNA expression
level of constitutive subunits decreased, the expression level of immunoproteasome subunits increased,

and the expression level of immunoproteasome subunits exceeded that of constitutive subunits, as indicated by increased ratios of LMP2/b1, LMP7/b5, and
MECL-1/b2 (Fig. 4B), most likely leading to the assembly of proteasomes that preferentially contained
the IFN-g-inducible b subunits.
To exclude regulation of the housekeeping gene
PBGD by IFN-g, in addition to PBGD, we determined
the expression level of the housekeeping gene
GAPDH in the 12 lymphoma cell lines after IFN-g
incubation and compared the DCp of these housekeeping genes after IFN-g incubation (Fig. 3C).
Again, we observed only minimal deviation of DCp
values (median, 8.54; range, 7.2–9.43) across the cell
lines. Moreover, comparing DCp values before and
after IFN-g incubation for each cell line revealed
nearly identical values. With the exception of the cell
line DG75, the differences in DCp values for all cell
lines were <1. This indicates that both housekeeping
genes are expressed relatively stably not only across
different cell lines but also under different experimental conditions.

noteworthy that, in contrast to the resistant Burkitt
lymphoma cell lines, in the cell line EHEB, IFN-g
pretreatment resulted in decreased ratios of LMP2/
b1 and MECL-1/b2.
In addition, in 6 of 12 solid tumor cell lines, a
significant increase in sensitivity to apoptosis induction by PS-341 could be observed even in the refractory cell lines SkMel 5, SW480, SW620, and 8505C
(Fig. 5B). Mainly early apoptotic cells were observed;
only in the cell line CaCo2 were most of the apoptotic cells late. The cell line MelHo was the only line in
which we observed a significant increase in necrotic
cells (10% at 20 nM PS-341).
Regarding the enhancing effect of IFN-g, no entity-specific behavior was observed. It is interesting
to note that 1 cell line, the breast carcinoma cell
line MDA-MB435S, which exhibited moderate sensitivity to apoptosis induction by PS-341, was resistant after 2 days of incubation with IFN-g. No
enhancing effect of IFN-g was observed when cells
were incubated with PS-341 and IFN-g simultaneously for 24 hours.

Pretreatment With IFN-c Augments Sensitivity to
Proteasome Inhibition
The next question was whether pretreatment with
IFN-g would have an impact on sensitivity to proteasome inhibition. To induce immunoproteasome formation, all cell lines were incubated with IFN-g.
After 2 days, PS-341 was added, and survival was
determined by flow cytometry after 12 hours in Bcell lines and after 24 hours in solid tumor cell lines,
as described above.
No significant reduction in viability was observed
in cell lines that were treated with IFN-g alone (data
not shown). Again, a dose-dependent effect of apoptosis induction by PS-341 was observed. Regarding
B-cell lines, the refractory cell line KARPAS422 and
5 of the 6 moderately sensitive cell lines exhibited a
marked increase in apoptosis after IFN-g pretreatment (Fig. 5A). In cell cultures that were incubated
with 20 nM PS-341, response could be enhanced up
to 60%. Along with the induction of early apoptotic
cells, the induction of late apoptotic cells could be
observed in the cell lines AMO-1 and Granta519.
The highest increase in sensitivity was observed for
the plasmacytoma cell line U266. In the highly sensitive Group III cell lines, only little or no further decrease
in viability was observed.
The resistant Burkitt lymphoma cell lines DG75
and RAJI and the intermediate sensitive B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cell line
EHEB exhibited no further decrease in viability. It is

DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrated that expression
levels of proteasome subunits are correlated with the
sensitivity of neoplastic B cells and solid tumor cells
to proteasome inhibition. In line with this finding,
we demonstrated that pretreatment with IFN-g,
which favors immunoproteasome assembly, was able
to augment sensitivity to PS-341.
To our knowledge, to date, the precise mechanisms leading to PS-341 resistance are not known.
Several studies have demonstrated that rapidly proliferating cell lines are more susceptible than slowly
proliferating cell lines. This may be explained in part
by a greater dependency of rapidly dividing, malignant cells on proteasomal activity for the removal of
aberrant proteins. Proteasome activity is determined
by both quantity and quality of assembled proteasomes. Compared with solid tumor cells, which preferentially express standard proteasome subunits,
neoplastic B cells can express constitutively both
standard proteasomes and immunoproteasomes.14
Compared with standard proteasomes, immunoproteasomes are characterized by enhanced proteolytic
activity.4,15 Therefore, differences in expression levels
of proteasome subunits may influence sensitivity to
PS-341. Comparing the median expression level of
the enzymatic, active proteasome subunits in sensitive lymphoma and plasmocytoma cells with the
level in solid tumor cell lines indicates that the less
sensitive solid tumor cell lines express all immuno-

proteasome subunits as well as the constitutive subunit b2 clearly below the median of the expression
level of the sensitive B-cell lines.
Moreover, regarding differences in the sensitivity
of neoplastic B cells, most of the intermediate and
refractory B-cell lines exhibited low expression levels
of the immunoproteasome subunits MECL-1 and/or
LMP2. An assembling of immunoproteasomes may
be impaired as a direct consequence of this lower
expression level, because assembly of LMP2 and
MECL-1 is an early event in immunoproteasome formation.16,17 We were able to verify a lack of sizable
activity of the immunoproteasome catalytic subunits
in assembled proteasomes in the refractory cell lines
DG75 and KARPAS442. Compared with the B-cell
lines, solid tumor cell lines exhibited greater variability in expressions levels of immunoproteasome subunits; therefore, greater variability in sensitivity to
proteasome inhibition may be expected. However,
because of the low expression levels of immunopro-

teasome subunits in the less sensitive solid tumor
cell lines, this variability may have no influence on
sensitivity to proteasome inhibition.
Comparing the expression levels of the standard
subunits revealed that the refractory B-cell lines and
the solid tumor cell lines, with the exception of the
more sensitive cell line MelHo, express the constitutive subunit b2 clearly below the median of the
expression level of the sensitive B cell lines. Therefore, it appears reasonable to suggest that the higher
sensitivity of the cell line MelHo compared with the
other solid tumor cell lines is explained by the higher
expression of all constitutive proteasome subunits,
leading to more assembled standard proteasomes.
It appears reasonable to expect that low expression of b2 and its corresponding immunoproteasome
subunit MECL-1, as observed in the refractory B-cell
line DG75, may result in an impaired formation of
proteasomes in general. However, although we were
able to verify a lack of sizable activity of the immu-

Sensitivity to Proteasome Inhibition/Busse et al.

noproteasome catalytic subunits in assembled proteasomes of DG75 cells, standard proteasome subunits were detected at least at the level of the other 3
lymphoma cell lines. Therefore, mRNA expression
levels of proteasome subunits do not truly reflect the
quantitative protein expression level of proteasome
subunits in assembled and functional, active proteasomes. Moreover, the situation is most likely more
complex. Although formation of homogeneous immunoproteasomes or standard proteasomes is
favored, assembly of mixed proteasomes that contain
both standard subunits and immunoproteasome subunits is possible. Because of the influence of subunit
propeptides on cooperative assembly, certain combinations are favored over others18: Assembly of proteasomes that contain the immunoproteasome
subunit MECL-1 in combination with the standard
subunits b1 and b5 is not favored. In addition, combination of the immunoproteasome subunits MECL1 and LMP7 with the standard subunit b1 is not
favored. This may explain the refractory behavior of
the cell line KARPAS422, which exhibited low expression of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP2 and
the standard subunit b2 in contrast to their corresponding subunits b1 and MECL-1, respectively,
which do not prefer to assemble. Our data suggest
that cells exerting high proteasomal activity—determined by their expression level of proteasome subunits and their subunit composition—are more
dependent on proteasome function than cells with
lower proteasomal activity. Therefore, these cells are
more sensitive to proteasomal inhibition.
If this assumption is be correct, then changing
subunit composition by the up-regulation of immunoproteasome subunits and consequently increasing
the proteasomal activity could render cells more
susceptible to proteasome inhibitors. It is known
that IFN-g favors immunoproteasome formation by
up-regulating gene expression levels of the immunoproteasome subunits LMP2, LMP7, and MECL-1.
Our finding of a profound augmentation of the sensitivity to proteasome inhibition by IFN-g pretreatment in 50% of both lymphoma and myeloma cell
lines as well as solid tumor cell lines supports our
concept that cells with high proteasomal activity are
more sensitive to proteasomal inhibition and that
the up-regulation of proteasomal activity, per se,
may be associated with an increase in dependency
on proteasomal function. However, because IFN-g is
involved in the transcriptional regulation of >200
genes, the increased sensitivity to PS-341 after pretreatment with IFN-g also may be related to
changes in expression levels of apoptosis regulators
or induction of caspases, especially caspase 8,

669

resulting in increased caspase activation by both
compounds.19,20
We could not enhance the apoptosis-inducing
effect of PS-341 by IFN-g in any solid tumor cell
lines, in the resistant Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, or
in the CLL cell line EHEB despite the induction of
immunoproteasome subunits. This failure may have
been caused by the activation of alternative proteolytic pathways in these cells, which could not be
overcome by IFN-g pretreatment or even may be
induced by IFN-g. High expression of TPPII, which is
believed to replace proteasomal function, as well as
deubiquitinating enzymes was demonstrated for Burkitt lymphoma cells, which were refractory to proteasome inhibitors, and inhibition of TPPII results in
apoptosis of these cells.10,11 Moreover, as stated
above, the expression level of mRNA does not reflect
the level of assembled and functional, active proteasomes. Impaired assembly of functional, active proteasomes can be related to mutations of enzymatic
subunits or lack of other factors known to be important for assembly. The breast carcinoma cell line
MDA-MB435S, which exhibited moderate sensitivity
to apoptosis induction by PS-341, was resistant after
2 days of incubation with IFN-g.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the sensitivity of tumor cell lines to proteasome inhibition is
correlated with the expression level of proteasome
subunits and with the composition of these subunits.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that IFN-g pretreatment can enhance the response to proteasome inhibition, an observation that potentially has great
clinical relevance. These preclinical studies suggest
that combining PS-341 with IFN-g may be useful to
enhance its clinical efficacy.
