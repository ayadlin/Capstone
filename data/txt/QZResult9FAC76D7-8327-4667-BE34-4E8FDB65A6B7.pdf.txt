BACKGROUND: Although many trials have shown the efficacy of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or postoperative CRT compared with surgery alone, the optimal sequence of radiotherapy and surgery is unclear. The authors
reported the final results of this single institution prospective randomized phase 3 trial comparing preoperative CRT
with postoperative CRT using capecitabine in survival, local control, sphincter preservation, and toxicity for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT3, potentially resectable cT4 or Nþ) were randomly assigned to receive preoperative or postoperative CRT. CRT consisted of 50 Gy/
25 fractions and concurrent capecitabine (1,650 mg/m2/day). Total mesorectal excision was performed. RESULTS:
From March 2004 to April 2006, 240 patients were enrolled. Clinical characteristics were well balanced between
both arms, except for more low-lying (<5 cm from anal verge) tumors in the preoperative CRT arm (60% vs 46%, P ¼
.041). After a median follow-up time of 52 months, the 3- and 5-year disease-free survival, overall survival, and cumulative incidence of local recurrence were similar between both arms. However, for the patients with low-lying tumors,
the preoperative CRT arm had a higher rate of sphincter preservation (68% vs 42%, P ¼ .008). Acute and late complication rates were similar between both arms. CONCLUSIONS: Although significant benefit of preoperative CRT in
local control and survival was not demonstrated, the data showed that increased rate of sphincter preservation was
possible in low-lying tumors without jeopardizing local control and surgical complication by preoperative CRT.

In locally advanced rectal cancer, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) improves local control and survival.1 Although
radical surgery followed by adjuvant CRT had been the standard treatment, there was a recent change from postoperative
CRT to preoperative CRT based on several studies.2,3 These trials showed the superiority of preoperative CRT over postoperative CRT, but there were several differences in the results between the trials.2,3 The German trial demonstrated significant improvement in local control, sphincter preservation rate, and treatment-related toxicities in the preoperative
CRT arm but not in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS).2 However, the NSABP R-03 trial showed
improved DFS and a trend toward improved OS in the preoperative CRT arm but not in local control, sphincter preservation, and treatment-related toxicities.3 In previous randomized trials that compared preoperative CRT with radiotherapy
(RT) alone for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer, preoperative CRT improved local control.4,5
In those randomized controlled trials for preoperative CRT, bolus injection or continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) was used.2-5 Although CRT with protracted 5-FU infusion has proven to be superior to conventional bolus injection,6 protracted infusion is an inconvenient and invasive procedure, requires an ambulatory infusion pump, and is

Several studies have examined the use of new oral chemotherapeutic agents in the CRT protocol for treatment of
rectal cancer with many biologic and clinical advantages
including mimicking protracted infusion of 5-FU.7-10 In
a prospective phase 2 trial of preoperative CRT with capecitabine, we reported encouraging rates of tumor downstaging, sphincter preservation, and low toxicity.11
With such encouraging outcomes, we designed a
prospective, single institution phase 3 trial that compared
preoperative CRT and postoperative CRT in survival,
local control, sphincter preservation, and treatmentrelated toxicity for treatment of locally advanced rectal
cancer. We hypothesized that the superiority of preoperative CRT over postoperative CRT could be effectively
evaluated by a single institution study of a high-volume
center for better quality assurance in surgery and RT with
the potential advantages of the modern approach of CRT
using capecitabine. We present the final results of our trial
with a median follow-up time of 52 months.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility and Randomization
The Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center
approved this protocol. Patients were enrolled from
March 2004 to April 2006. Patients with locally advanced
rectal cancer (cT3 or potentially resectable cT4 or positive
regional lymph node) on endorectal ultrasonography
(EUS) and abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT)
scan qualified for this study. Further eligibility criteria

3704

were similar to our previous phase 2 trial (Table 1).11 After written informed consent was obtained, all patients
were randomly assigned to the preoperative CRT arm or
the postoperative CRT arm (Fig. 1A). The treatment allocation was performed in a randomized permuted block
method using random number tables and included stratification by gender.
Treatment
The radiation dose for preoperative treatment was 46 Gy
in 23 fractions to the whole pelvis followed by a boost dose
of 4 Gy in 2 fractions. The radiation dose for postoperative
RT was 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the whole pelvis. Detailed
information on RT has been described previously.11
Capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice per day, without
weekend breaks) was initiated on the first day of RT and
was delivered concurrently with RT. Adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated 4 weeks after surgery in the preoperative CRT arm and at 4 weeks after completion of CRT
in the postoperative CRT arm. Adjuvant chemotherapy
consisted of 4 cycles of capecitabine (2,500 mg/m2/day
for 14 days, followed by a 1-week break) or 4 cycles of
bolus 5-FU/leucovorin (375 mg 5-FU/m2/day and 20 mg
leucovorin/m2/day for 5 days every 4 weeks), which was
chosen based on patient economic status, because capecitabine is not covered by the medical insurance system of
Korea. Patients were instructed to take capecitabine twice
per day at 12-hour intervals, and to take one of the doses 1
hour before RT to maximize the radiosensitization effect
based on our previous study.12
Total mesorectal excision (TME) was performed as
the standard procedure, and the particular type of surgery
was determined at the time of resection. All operations
were carried out by specialist colorectal surgeons who had
performed more than 200 TMEs each year for the past 5
years. Surgery was performed 4 to 6 weeks after completion of CRT.
Evaluation
Pretreatment evaluation included complete blood counts
(CBC) and biochemical profiles, serum carcinoembryonic
antigen, colonoscopy with biopsy, abdominopelvic CT
scan, EUS, and chest CT scan. Clinical staging was based
on abdominopelvic CT and EUS findings and the
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging
system.13
Treatment-related toxicity was evaluated according
to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
version 2.0.14 During CRT, patients were examined

weekly. After completion of treatment, patients were
scheduled for follow-up every 3 months for first 2 years,
then every 6 months thereafter. Complete history and
physical examination, complete blood count (CBC),
biochemical profile, serum carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA), and chest radiography were performed at each follow-up. Abdominopelvic CT scan was performed every 6
months for first 2 years, then annually thereafter. Colonoscopic evaluation was performed annually.
After surgery and tumor fixation, the largest diameter
of the tumor was recorded. Then tumor was examined by
slicing it into 3- to 5-mm sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. If tumor cells were not found in initial examination, thinner slices were taken for further inspection.
Complete lymph node dissection from perirectal fat tissue
and microscopic examination were also performed. Pathologic stage was determined using the TNM classification
system, as recommended by the AJCC.
Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was 3-year DFS. This study was
designed to have 85% statistical power to detect an
increase in DFS of 15% at 3 years in the preoperative CRT
group, with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. This
required a sample size of 216 patients per treatment arm.

Cancer

The secondary end points were OS, local or distant relapse,
sphincter preservation, and treatment-related toxicities.
All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
(version 14.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Chi-square tests or
Fisher exact tests were used to compare patient characteristics between both arms for categorical variables, and Student t tests were used to compare quantitative variables.
All eligible patients were included in the evaluation of OS,
DFS, and the cumulative incidence of local and distant
recurrences based on intent-to-treat analysis. All events
were determined from the first day of RT in the preoperative CRT arm and from the date of surgery in the postoperative CRT arm. Pathologic confirmation of recurrent
disease was encouraged. If histologic evidence was not
available, a clear demonstration of recurrent lesions or serial enlargement of the lesions based on radiology was
accepted as the evidence of treatment failure. Elevated
CEA alone was not considered as evidence of recurrence.
Local recurrence was defined as tumor recurrence within
radiation field in pelvic cavity, and distant metastasis was
defined as any recurrence outside of pelvic cavity. All survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method and were compared using the log-rank test. Twotailed probability (P) values less than .05 were considered
to indicate a significant difference.

RESULTS
Accrual of the Patients and Patient
Characteristics
Between March 2004 and April 2006, 240 patients were
randomly assigned to receive preoperative or postoperative CRT. We could not enroll the planned number of
patients because patient accrual decreased after publication of the study by Sauer et al.2 In addition, randomization could have been affected by investigator preference
for preoperative treatment for low-lying tumors; hence,
we closed this protocol earlier than initially planned.
Among the 240 patients initially enrolled, 20 were
determined to be ineligible for the following reasons: 10
patients withdrew consent, 5 had distant metastases that
were detected after enrollment, 3 had early stage disease
(cT2N0) on additional staging work-ups, 1 had a history
of pelvic irradiation for uterine cervical cancer, and 1 had
recurrent rectal cancer. Most of the characteristics of the
220 eligible patients were relatively well balanced between
both arms (Table 2). However, there were significantly

3706

more patients with low-lying tumors (<5 cm from the
anal verge) in the preoperative treatment arm (Table 2).
Treatment
A total of 107 patients were randomly assigned to the preoperative CRT arm and 113 patients to the postoperative
CRT arm. CRT was not administered to 16 patients
assigned to the postoperative CRT arm (Fig. 1B). Two
patients in the preoperative CRT arm did not have surgical resection after preoperative CRT, and there were protocol violations in 11 patients, including 10 patients in
the postoperative CRT arm who were transferred to
regional hospitals and received nonprotocol-based treatment (Fig. 1B).
RT was completed according to protocol in 106
patients from the preoperative CRT arm and 86 patients
from the postoperative CRT arm (99% vs 76%, P <
.001) (Table 3). Concurrent chemotherapy was completed according to protocol in 100 patients from the
preoperative CRT arm and 85 patients from the postoperative CRT arm (93% vs 75%, P < .001). Thus, 99
patients (93%) in the preoperative CRT arm and 84
patients (74%) in the postoperative CRT arm completed
CRT as protocol.
Among all patients, except the patients who did not
received the postoperative CRT (16 patients), 16 (7%)
never started adjuvant chemotherapy due to disease progression (5 patients), postoperative complication (3
patients), refusal (3 patients), toxic effects of concurrent
CRT (1 patient), and other causes (4 patients). Treatment
compliance with the adjuvant chemotherapy was better in
the preoperative CRT arm. Adjuvant chemotherapy was
administered to 95 patients in the preoperative CRT arm
and 83 patients in the postoperative CRT arm (89% vs
73%, P ¼ .002) as full dose or modified dose/cycle. The
full protocol dose was administered to 68 patients in the
preoperative-CRT arm and 56 patients in the postoperative CRT arm (64% vs 50%, P ¼ .036).
Surgery and Pathologic Findings
Complete resection confirmed by pathologic examination
was performed in 217 of 218 patients who had resection.
In 1 patient, the tumor could not be completely resected
due to extensive vaginal invasion. The sphincter-sparing
rate was similar in the 2 groups; however, among patients
with low-lying tumors, the preoperative CRT arm had a
higher rate of sphincter-sparing surgery (Table 4).
Pathologic stage was lower in the preoperative CRT
arm than in the postoperative CRT arm (Table 5).

Complete disappearance of the primary tumor in pathology specimens (ypCR-T) occurred in 22 patients (21%),
and 83 patients (79%) had no tumor cells in their lymph

had residual tumor cells in lymph nodes; thus, complete
tumor disappearance occurred in 18 patients (17%). The
mean tumor size was significantly smaller in the preoperative CRT arm and microscopic tumor invasions such as

Acute Toxicities and Postoperative
Complications
Preoperative and postoperative CRT was relatively well
tolerated in most patients, and there was no treatmentrelated mortality. Most acute adverse events were mild to
moderate, and all of them resolved spontaneously with
supportive care (Table 6). The overall incidence of acute
toxicities was comparable between both arms (15% vs
16%, P ¼ .827).
Perioperative (within 2 months of surgery) and late
complications (more than 2 months after surgery) were
also similar between both arms (Table 6). All patients
recovered after supportive care or surgical treatment.
Among the patients with perioperative complications, 8
patients in the preoperative CRT arm and 10 patients in
the postoperative CRT arm had grade 3 or 4 toxicities
(9% vs 12%, P ¼ .359). Among the patients with late
complications, 8 patients in the preoperative CRT arm
and 3 patients in the postoperative CRT arm had grade 3
or 4 toxicities (8% vs 3%, P ¼ .350).

there was no significant difference in acute and late toxicities in both arms. Compliance rate was higher in the preoperative CRT arm. However, most of the noncompliant
patients in the postoperative CRT arm were those who
were transferred from distant cancer centers and travel
problems led to noncompliance. Although they were
regarded as a noncompliance group in our protocol, they
all received one of the standard treatments recommended
by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
guidelines in regional cancer centers.
Postoperative CRT arm of our trial had a more
favorable toxicity profile and compliance than those of the
German or NSABR-R03 trial,2,3 although we cannot
explain. It is possible that this difference might be due to
the use of different chemotherapeutic agents. The design
of the current trial was similar to other phase 3 trials,2,3
but we used oral capecitabine based on encouraging
results of our previous studies.11,12 Clearly, more data are

needed to determine whether continuous infusion or
bolus injection of 5-FU is more effective for treatment of
rectal cancer.15 However, previous retrospective studies
comparing capecitabine and 5-FU indicated that capecitabine was at least as effective as 5-FU in preoperative CRT
regimen.16-19 The NSABP R-04 trial is expected to provide important information about the efficacy of oral
capecitabine versus 5-FU chemotherapy.20 This trial has
completed accrual and the results are pending. Surgeon
factor could be another possible reason for the superior
result of the current study than the German trial. Because
the current trial was a single institution study of a highvolume center and our retrospective study also showed relatively low incidence of late complications in the postoperative RT group, better quality in surgery and RT could
be possible reasons.21
In our current study, we used a 7-day-per-week
capecitabine schedule based on our previous phase 2
trial that showed encouraging rates of tumor downstaging and sphincter preservation with a low toxicity
profile.11 However, a 7-day-per-week schedule is not
the golden standard of care, and a 5-day-per-week
schedule used in many centers could be superior to the
7-day regimen in the view of compliance and toxicity,
with similar efficacy.22 We think that further study

Cancer

concerning this issue will be needed for the establishment of an ideal regimen of capecitabine with preoperative RT in rectal cancer.
Sphincter Preservation
One of the rationales for preoperative CRT is the
enhancement of sphincter preservation in patients with
low rectal cancer. The current study showed that lowlying rectal cancer patients in the preoperative CRT arm
had significantly better sphincter preservation than did
patients in the postoperative CRT arm, but sphincter
preservation did not produce negative effects in terms of
complications and disease control in the preoperative
CRT arm.
However, functional outcome after sphincter preservation was not examined in the German and the current
trial.2 The ultimate goal of sphincter preservation must be
improvement in quality of life and not simply preservation of the sphincter complex. We suggest that future

rate or other histologic parameters were comparable with
other studies that used capecitabine,16-18,23-26 and our
ypCR rate was higher than that of the German trial (17%
vs 8%) in spite of more adverse factors (Table 7).2
The exact reason for these differences is not clear,
but we propose the following 2 explanations. First, use of
capecitabine during the whole period of RT with an optimized time interval between capecitabine intake and radiation might have enhanced the radiosensitizing effect of
capecitabine relative to bolus 5-FU injection.12 Second,
racial and genetic differences among the patients of East
and West may account for the differences. The first explanation seems to be reasonable but not conclusive because
pathologic complete response rate has been reported to be
slightly higher in the capecitabine-based regimen than
5-FU.2,3,16-18,20,27 The second explanations are difficult
to prove but commonly used.
Local Control and Survival
Previous German and NSABP phase 3 trials demonstrated
the superiority of preoperative CRT in terms of local control and DFS (Table 7),2,3 but we could not observe such
benefits in the current study. Because the statistical power
of the current trial was limited owing to premature
closure, the superiority of preoperative CRT over postoperative CRT might not be excluded. However, our postoperative CRT arm had better 5-year OS and DFS rates
(85% and 74%) than those reported in the German trial

3710

(74% and 65%) and NSABP-R03 trial (66% and
53%).2,3 The 5-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence in our postoperative-CRT arm was similar to that of
the preoperative CRT arm of the German trial (6%).2
One possible reason for this discordance may be that
patients in the 2 studies had different distribution of cancer stage. However, we believe that this is unlikely because
the proportion of clinical T4 disease was only 3% in the
German trial and pathologic stage 3 disease was more
prevalent in our study (68% and 40%). Moreover, the
rate of overstaging in our study was 8%, which was lower
than in the German trial (18%).2 Relatively high compliance rate in our study may be another possible explanation
for this discordance. Pre- and postoperative CRT were
both well tolerated by most patients in our study. Other
trials reported very high rates of acute toxicities of grade 3
or higher (40%-49%), much higher than for the patients
of our postoperative CRT arm.2,3 Moreover, almost half
of the patients in the German trial did not receive planned
postoperative CRT.2 Another possible reason for our better results may be associated with a single institution study
performed in a high-volume hospital. Hospital volume
factor seems to play an important role in achieving high
local control.28 The current trial was conducted in a highvolume tertiary referral center (with >2,500 beds), and
participating surgeons were those who had performed
more than 200 TMEs each year for the past 5 years. Also,
the parameters for RT in a single institution study would

likely be more uniform than in the multicenter trials.29
RT was performed by a single radiation oncologist who
majored in gastrointestinal oncology.
Summary
One of the major strengths of the current single institution study of a high-volume center is that it allowed for
better quality assurance in surgery and RT than a multicenter trial and the multidisciplinary teamwork that goes
with that, so the quality of overall care was probably better
and more homogeneous than the German trial. Also, the
current trial included only middle and distal tumors,
which had a higher risk of local recurrence than proximal
tumors and which made the current trial more appropriate for evaluation of the role of RT as a local modality.
This trial was closed prematurely; although the German
trial that used bolus 5-FU globally accepted at that time
hampered our ability to complete patient accrual, our trial
provided a more modern approach in preoperative CRT
for locally advanced rectal cancer with the oral fluoropyrimidine, capecitabine.
The results of the current trial suggested that preoperative or postoperative CRT with capecitabine was well
tolerated by most rectal cancer patients and that treatment
compliance was excellent. Perioperative and long-term
late complications were not increased by use of preoperative CRT. Although we could not demonstrate significant
benefit of preoperative CRT in terms of local control and
survival, the rate of sphincter-sparing surgery was higher
in preoperative CRT patients with low-lying rectal tumors
without jeopardizing local control and surgical safety by
preoperative CRT.
