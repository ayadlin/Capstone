ABSTRACT
The gelatinase inhibitor doxycycline is the prototypical antitumor antibiotic. We
investigated the effects of doxycycline on the migration, invasion, and metastasis of
human lung cancer cell lines and in a mouse model. We also measured the effect of
doxycycline on the transcription of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers,
and used immunohistochemistry to determine whether EMT reversal was associated with
doxycycline inhibition. Doxycycline dose-dependently inhibited proliferation, migration,
and invasion of NCI-H446 human small cell lung cancer cells. It also suppressed tumor
growth from NCI-H446 and A549 lung cancer cell xenografts without altering body
weight, inhibited Lewis lung carcinoma cell migration, and prolonged survival. The
activities of the transcription factors Twist1/2, SNAI1/2, AP1, NF-κB, and Stat3 were
suppressed by doxycycline, which reversed EMT and inhibited signal transduction,
thereby suppressing tumor growth and metastasis. Our data demonstrate functional
targeting of transcription factors by doxycycline to reverse EMT and suppress tumor
proliferation and metastasis. Thus, doxycycline selectively targets malignant tumors
and reduces its metastatic potential with less cytotoxicity in lung cancer patients.

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer
mortality worldwide [9]. Tumor recurrence and metastasis
are common in lung cancer despite various lines of
standard therapy and the introduction of targeted agents.
The vast majority of patients with lung cancer fail to
respond to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors against the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) [10], and no effective drug
is available for small cell lung cancer [11, 12]. Therefore,
the development of alternative treatments is urgently
needed to improve outcome.
To investigate the therapeutic efficacy and the
mechanism of action of doxycycline in lung cancer, we
investigated the effects of doxycycline on migration,
invasion, and metastasis of various lung cancer cell lines.
We also examined its functional interference in EMT. In

INTRODUCTION
Antibiotics that target mitochondria have great
potential as anticancer drugs. [1]. For example, tetracyclines
are cytotoxic to some tumor cells [2] and have been shown
to induce apoptosis in osteosarcoma, prostatic cancer cells,
and lymphocytes [4, 5]. Doxycycline, a semi-synthetic
tetracycline, inhibits matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
activation and cell proliferation [3] and can also interfere
with tumor-related protein synthesis in mammalian cells
[6–8]. The selective permeability of different mammalian
cells to doxycycline led to the hypothesis that it could be
used to arrest cell proliferation and treat malignancies. Thus,
doxycycline has been used in combination with targeted
drugs in clinical trials with patients with advanced cancer.

addition, we used a tumor-bearing mouse xenograft model to
investigate doxycycline inhibition of tumor growth in vivo.

NCI-H446 and A549 cells with or without doxycycline
treatment. As shown in Fig. 2E, doxycycline inhibited
MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion into the medium in a dosedependent manner. This finding suggests that doxycycline
may reduce lung cancer metastasis by inhibiting the
degradation of the ECM and basement membrane.

RESULTS
Doxycycline reduces cell viability and alters cell
cycle dynamics in human lung cancer cell lines

Doxycycline inhibits the expression of epithelial
markers and changes cellular morphology

Using MTT assay, we determined the effect of 48 h
treatment with doxycycline on cell viability of various
cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1A, lung cancer cells
were more sensitive to doxycycline than most of the other
cell lines. NCI-H446 and A549 cells showed sensitivity
to doxycycline with IC50 values of 1.7043 ± 0.1241
and 1.0638 ± 0.1266 μM, respectively. Proliferation
of NCI-H446 (Fig. 1B) and A549 cells (Fig. 1C) was
inhibited by doxycycline in a dose-dependent manner.
We also investigated whether doxycycline interferes
with the cell cycle. NCI-H446 and A549 cells were treated
with different doses of doxycycline for 24 h, followed
by cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. Cells treated
with doxycycline started to arrest at G0/G1 phase after
treatment for 24 h (Fig. 1D & 1E). After treatment,
NCI-H446 cells at G0/G1 accounted for approximately
24% of the total cell population, and A549 cells in G0/G1
population accounted for approximately 44%.

Vimentin and E-cadherin regulate the expression
of proteins involved in ECM degradation. Thus, we
used immunofluorescent staining to measure the effect
of doxycycline on vimentin and E-cadherin levels.
NCI-H446 and A549 cells were treated with different
doses of doxycycline for 24 h,. In response to doxycycline
treatment, vimentin expression decreased, whereas
E-cadherin expression increased in both cell lines (Fig. 3A
& 3B). We also tested the effect of doxycycline on the
cellular morphology of NCI-H446 and A549 by HCS.
In response to doxycycline treatment, the perimeter-toarea ratio decreased, whereas pyknosis increased in both
NCI-H446 and A549 cells (Fig. 3C & 3F). The relative
area of nucleus also increased, whereas the DNA content
in cells decreased in both NCI-H446 and A549 cells
(Fig. 3D & 3E). As shown in Fig. 3, the results of DNA
reduction were comparisons of all cells, not only S stage
cells. For A549 cells, as shown in Fig. 1E, the number of
S stage cells did not differ between groups.

Doxycycline inhibits lung cancer cell invasion
and migration in vitro

Doxycycline inhibits the activity of EMT
transcription factors

To study whether doxycycline inhibits NCI-H446
and A549 cell invasion we used Matrigel-coated transwell
chambers. For both cell lines, when compared with the
control group, the number of cell invasions through the
Matrigel-coated filter was dose-dependently reduced by
doxycycline (Fig. 2A & 2B). Notably, the inhibitory effects
of doxycycline on cell invasion were due to its cytotoxic
effects, given that cell viability was also decreased at the
concentration ranges tested.
Next we assessed the ability of doxycycline to
inhibit the migration of NCI-H446 and A549 cells using
a wound-healing assay. Confluent cells were scraped
with a sterile pipette tip, and the remaining cells were
allowed to migrate into the gap created in the absence or
presence of doxycycline. Remarkably, after 24 and 48 h
treatment, the wound gap of both cell types was wider
in the doxycycline-treated groups than in the untreated
groups (Fig. 2C & 2D), indicating that doxycycline inhibits
motility of both NCI-H446 and A549 cells. The cell growth
curves of NCI-H446 and A549 were shown in Fig. S1
The degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM)
and basement membrane are crucial steps in cancer
invasion and metastasis and the proteolytic enzymes
MMP-2 and MMP-9 are involved in this process. We
next measured the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 from
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NCI-H446 and A549 cells transfected with
luciferase reporter plasmids for various gene promoters or
response elements were treated with doxycycline for 48 h.
In NCI-H446 cells, doxycycline suppressed the expression
of Twist1, Twist2, SNAI1, STAT-3, and NF-κB and
promoted the expression of AP-1. However, no change in
SNAI2 expression was observed (Fig. 4A). In A549 cells,
doxycycline suppressed the expression of Twist1, Twist2,
SNAI1, SNAI2, STAT-3, and NF-κB and promoted
the expression of AP-1 (Fig. 4B). Multidimensional
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
was performed to evaluate differentially expressed
proteins in NCI-H446 cells after doxycycline treatment.
36 proteins were upregulated by doxycycline and 42 were
downregulated. After doxycycline treatment in cancer cell
lines, RPLs were directly or indirectly regulated. Some
RPLs were inhibited by doxycycline, such as RPL23A,
RPL10A, RPL12, RPL38 and RPL13. On the contrary,
RPL3 was compensatorily increased to maintain basic
protein synthesis. (Fig. 4C–4G). These proteins are
involved in cell migration, cytoskeletal maintenance, cell
proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation (Fig. 4H).

Doxycycline has an antitumor effect in a mouse
xenograft model

mesenchyme and neuroectoderm, including melanomas,
endothelial cell tumors, and sarcomas [20, 22, 23].
All three kinds of lung cancer cells used in this study
have mesodermal characteristics and readily undergo
EMT [24–26]. NCI-H446 is a small cell lung cancer cell
originating from neuroectoderm, while A549 cells are
thought to have already undergone EMT. By contrast,
lung squamous cell carcinoma is not very sensitive to
doxycycline (unpublished data).
Doxycycline has a strong inhibitory effect on cells
with mesenchymal characters. Early studies showed that
doxycycline influences focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and
cell adhesion and causes cells to lose anchors during
migration [20]. Our current study does not examine
whether doxycycline directly inhibits chemotaxis or
indirectly inhibits chemotaxis by the inhibition of
cell adhesion. It is possible that increased invasion
and migration might due to increased generation of
chemokines from tumor cells. Doxycycline also has
other targets, including MMPs and E-cadherin, ultimately
inhibiting metabolism and metastasis [27]. Two members
of the MMP family, MMP-2 and MMP-9, are necessary
for tumor invasion and metastasis [28, 29] [30]. Therefore,
decreasing MMP activity could inhibit cancer cell invasion
and metastasis [31, 32]. We examined the regulation of
MMP activity after doxycycline treatment. Our data
show that doxycycline inhibits MMP-2 and MMP-9
activation, which is consistent with its inhibitory effects
on metastasis.
EMT initiates tumor metastasis and alters cellcell adhesion [33–35]. E-cadherin and vimentin,
two biomarkers of EMT, mediate cell adhesion.
Downregulation of E-cadherin expression is both
necessary and sufficient to confer metastatic ability
to lung cancer cells that are otherwise non-metastatic
[36,  37]. Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein
that, along with microtubules and actin filaments, forms
the cytoskeleton. In some carcinomas, including prostatic
carcinoma, vimentin is overexpressed and is therefore a
marker for invasiveness and metastasis [38]. In this study,
we found that doxycycline increased E-cadherin levels
and decreased vimentin protein expression. This finding
suggests that doxycycline suppresses EMT in lung cancer.
In addition, studies of promoter activation and proteomics
after doxycycline treatment revealed that doxycycline
inhibits EMT-related transcription factor activity and that
doxycycline exerts its antitumor effect by interfering with
tumor cell EMT. These findings show that doxycycline
acts upstream of EMT-related signal transduction to inhibit
a wide range of cellular functions. The inhibitory effects
of doxycycline on bacteria is derived from its interference
with rhibosomes, which result in the inhibition of protein
synthesis. After doxycycline treatment in cancer cell
lines, RPLs were directly or indirectly regulated. Some
RPLs were inhibited by doxycycline, such as RPL23A,
RPL10A, RPL12, RPL38 and RPL13. On the contrary,

We next examined the effects of doxycycline on
spontaneous lung metastasis using NCI-H446 human lung
cancer and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) xenografts in
nude mice. Doxycycline treatment inhibited tumor growth
in a dose-dependent manner. In particular, the NCI-H446
xenografts in the cyclophosphamide group died out before
the end of the experiment (Fig. 5A & 5C, 5E & 5F). Body
weight increased in the doxycycline-treated group (Fig. 5B
& 5D). The median survival time of the control groups
of LLC xenografts was 15.5 days. When compared with
the control group, the median survival times of high-dose,
middle-dose, and low-dose doxycycline treatment groups
were increased by 235%, 197%, and 184%, respectively,
and the median survival time of the cyclophosphamide
treatment group was increased by 171% (Fig. 5G). The
number of tumors that shifted stoves was decreased from
22.4 ± 7.96 to 4.20 ± 1.79 in the lungs of nude mice with
LLC xenografts treated with doxycycline, (Fig. 5H). These
results strongly suggest that doxycycline inhibits tumor
growth and metastasis.

Doxycycline alters the expression of EMT
markers in cancer tissues
Immunohistochemical staining for E-cadherin,
vimentin, MMP-2, and MMP-9 showed their expression
to be correlated with doxycycline treatment. E-cadherin
exhibited low expression, whereas vimentin, MMP-2, and
MMP-9 exhibited high expression in tumor cells treated
with doxycycline compared with the untreated group in
both the membrane and cytoplasm (Fig. 6A & 6B).

DISCUSSION
By preventing and suppressing tumor invasion and
metastasis it may be possible to decrease the mortality
rates of patients with malignant tumors [13]. Despite
efforts to develop alternative treatments for lung cancer
[14, 15], in many cases the cancers are refractory and there
is still no effective therapy [16, 17, 18, 19].
Doxycycline has been shown to have high antimetastatic activity and low cytotoxicity in melanoma and
breast carcinoma [20, 21]. In clinical trials with patients
with pleural effusion, satisfactory results were achieved
when doxycycline was used and there was inhibition of the
activity of the suspended tumor cells. The current study
focuses on the mechanism and anti-metastatic effects of
doxycycline. We used several human cancer cell lines
to investigate the effect of doxycycline on cell viability
and the cell cycle. Our results showed that doxycycline
inhibited the proliferation of NCI-H446 and A549 cells
more than the other cell lines. Doxycycline has a strong
inhibitory effect on malignancies originating from

were established by subcutaneous injection of 1 × 107 cells
(suspended in PBS) into the flank. One day after tumor cell
inoculation, the mice were randomly divided into 5 groups
(n = 10/group). After the tumors reached an approximate
volume of 100 mm3 (approximately six weeks after
injection), the mice were treated with 60, 30, or 15 mg/kg
of doxycycline; 20 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide; or saline
by oral gavage once a day. Body weights were measured
at different time points after tumor cell inoculation. Tumor
diameters were measured every day, and tumor volumes
were calculated according to the formula V = ab2/2
(a = length of tumor, b = width of tumor). Seven weeks after
treatment, all mice were euthanized and both xenografts and
lungs were resected and measured. Lung tissue was
harvested for histologic examination and the nodes in lungs
were observed using a stereoscopic microscope. Metastases
from xenograft to lungs were measured after HE staining.
Another 50 mice were allocated randomly to
5 groups as described above (10 mice per group), in order
to measure survival rates. Each mouse was injected 1 × 107

hydrochloride for 24 h. At the end of incubation, the
conditioned medium was harvested, placed on 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel containing
0.2% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich Corp), and then separated
by electrophoresis. The gels were soaked in 2.5% Triton
X-100 in deionized water twice for 60 min at 25°C to
remove SDS. Gels were incubated at 37°C with substrate
buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, and
1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) for 18 h. The gel was stained
using 0.2% Coomassie blue for 1 h and destained in water
containing 10% acetic acid and 50% methanol. Bands
corresponding to the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9
were quantified with ImageJ (National Institutes of
Health).

Immunohistochemical analysis
Fresh tissues from mice were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut into 4 μm
thick slices, and placed on slides. The tissues were
deparaffinized with xylene, dehydrated in decreasing
concentrations of ethanol, and subsequently incubated with
3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min to block endogenous
peroxidase activity. For antigen retrieval, tissues were
treated with citrate buffered saline (pH 6.0) for 15 min at
95°C. Tissues were incubated with normal goat serum for
20 min at room temperature to block unspecific labeling
and then incubated with the following primary antibodies
in a humidified chamber overnight at 4°C: rabbit
polyclonal anti-E-cadherin (Zhongshan, ready-to-use),
goat polyclonal anti-vimentin (Affinity, dilution 1:50), and
rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP-9 (Zhongshan, ready-to-use).
Diaminobenzidine and hematoxylin were used for color
development and as counterstain, respectively. Expression
of E-cadherin and vimentin were independently evaluated
by two investigators. Tumor cells with brown staining
of the cytoplasm, nucleus or membrane were considered
positive and then scored based on four classes: none (0),
weak brown (1+), moderate brown (2+), and strong brown
(3+). The percentage of stained tumor cells was divided
into five classes: 0 for negative cells, 1 for 1–25%, 2 for
25–50%, 3 for 50–75%, and 4 for > 75%.

Dual-luciferase assay
NCI-H446 and A549 cells were transfected with
dual-reporter constructs using transfection reagents. After
changing to fresh medium 24 h after transfection, cells
were treated with various concentrations of doxycycline
hydrochloride. After 48 h, the culture medium was
collected into a 96-well white plate and luminescence
measured with a luminometer. Details are shown in
Table S3 and S4.

Multidimensional liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry
NCI-H446 and A549 cells (4 × 103 cells/mL) were
seeded in a 100 mm dish to 70–80% confluence. The
cells were then cultured in the presence (3.4 μM) or
absence of doxycycline hydrochloride for 24 h. After cell
lysis, samples were tested with multidimensional liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
