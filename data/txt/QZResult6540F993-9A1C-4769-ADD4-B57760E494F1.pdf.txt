Abstract
Recently, we reported that the ATP-binding cassette transporter 10 (ABCC10), also known as multidrug
resistance protein 7 (MRP7), is able to confer resistance to a variety of anticancer agents, including taxanes.
However, the in vivo functions of the pump have not been determined to any extent. In this study, we generated
and analyzed Abcc10/ mice to investigate the ability of Abcc10 to function as an endogenous resistance factor.
Mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from Abcc10/ mice were hypersensitive to docetaxel, paclitaxel, vincristine,
and cytarabine (Ara-C) and exhibited increased cellular drug accumulation, relative to wild-type controls.
Abcc10/ null mice treated with paclitaxel exhibited increased lethality associated with neutropenia and
marked bone marrow toxicity. In addition, toxicity in spleen and thymus was evident. These findings indicate
that Abcc10 is dispensable for health and viability and that it is an endogenous resistance factor for taxanes,
other natural product agents, and nucleoside analogues. This is the first demonstration that an ATP-binding
cassette transporter other than P-glycoprotein can affect in vivo tissue sensitivity toward taxanes. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Paclitaxel and its semisynthetic analogue, docetaxel, have
established roles in the treatment of common cancers, such as
cancer of the breast, lung, and prostate, as well as other less
common tumors, including cancer of the ovary and head and
neck (1). Taxanes exert cytotoxicity by stabilizing microtubules and inducing cell-cycle arrest. Because of the clinical
utility of taxanes, cellular factors that affect sensitivity have
been extensively investigated. Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified using cellular models of acquired
taxane resistance, including models of increased expression
of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug-efflux pump, acquired mutations in tubulin, increased expression of specific tubulin isoAuthors' Affiliations: 1Program in Developmental Therapeutics, 2Genomics Facility, and 3Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center,

forms, and alterations in signaling pathways involved in
tubulin function (2, 3). Correlational clinical studies have
largely highlighted the importance of 2 of these mechanisms—increased expression of P-gp and of the class III
b-tubulin (4–8).
Recently, we determined that ATP-binding cassette transporter 10 [ABCC10, also known as multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7)], a member of the MRP family of drug-efflux
pumps, is a novel cellular resistance factor for taxanes (9–13).
Analysis of the drug resistance capabilities of ABCC10 in the
stably transfected human embryonic kidney cell line 293
(HEK-293), revealed that it is unique among MRPs in that
taxanes are a prominent feature of its resistance profile (12). In
addition, ABCC10 is able to confer resistance to another class
of microtubule active agents—Vinca alkaloids—and to certain
nucleoside analogues (13). Ectopic expression of the pump in
highly drug-sensitive Mrp1//Mdr1a/b/ (Abcc1 and
Abcb1a/Abcb1b) fibroblasts confirmed the capacity of ABCC10
in conferring resistance to taxanes and vincristine, and, in
addition, uncovered its activity toward a range of other
natural product agents including daunorubicin, etoposide,
and SN-38 (13). Insights into the substrate selectivity of
ABCC10 have been afforded by in vitro transport studies. In
addition to largely hydrophobic molecules such as natural
product anticancer drugs, ABCC10 is able to transport amphipathic anions, as is the case for other MRPs (10). Among a
number of organic anions previously identified as transport
substrates of other MRPs, the selectivity of ABCC10 seems to
be restricted to glucuronides such as 17-b-estradiol-(17b-d-glucuronide), with additional modest activity toward
the glutathione conjugate leukotriene C4 (LTC4; ref. 14).

Although these studies have provided insights into the in
vitro properties of ABCC10, as assessed in transfected cell lines
and transport assays, and suggest that ABCC10 could play a
role in sensitivity toward taxanes, little is currently known
about the in vivo functions of the pump. To gain insights into
the physiologic and pharmacologic functions of ABCC10, and,
in particular, to determine its contribution to inherent sensitivity toward taxanes, an Abcc10/ mouse was generated and
analyzed. In this study, it is shown that Abcc10/ mice are
sensitized to paclitaxel and that cell lines derived from this
mouse model are hypersensitive to this agent, other natural
product agents, and cytarabine (Ara-C). We infer that Abcc10
is dispensable for health and viability and contributes to the
intrinsic resistance of cells and tissues toward several commonly employed chemotherapeutic agents, including taxanes.

Material and Methods
Targeted disruption of the Abcc10 gene and generation
of Abcc10/ mice
A mouse strain 129–derived l-phage genomic library was
probed with a 389-bp fragment containing the 50 -end of the
Abcc10 coding sequence, and an 12-kb Abcc10 clone was
isolated. Nucleotide-sequence analysis (ABI 377 DNA sequencer, Applied Biosystems) indicated that the clone encompassed exons 6–16 [amino acids (a.a.) 204–410] of the
Abcc10 gene, corresponding to nucleotides 612–1,231 of the
coding sequence. The left and right arms of a targeting vector
were excised and inserted, respectively, into the 50 - and 30 -end
cloning sites of the phosphoglycerine kinase (PGK)-neo cassette of the PNT plasmid (15). The resulting vector was
designed to delete exons 6–8, encoding a.a. 204–332 (nucleotides 612–996). Consequently, the Walker B motif required for
nucleotide binding is deleted and a frameshift is introduced in
the coding sequence.
The nucleotide sequence of the cloned arms was confirmed, and the 5.4-kb targeting vector was linearized with
NotI. The vector was electroporated into strain 129–derived
R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells, and individual colonies were
isolated after positive/negative selection with G418 and
gancyclovir (15). EcoRI-digested genomic DNA was prepared
and analyzed for proper right-arm recombination by Southern blot analysis using a 30 -probe. A PCR strategy was used to
identify correct left-arm recombinants. The primers were 50 CCTTTTGCCCCACATCTCAACC-30 (Abcc10 sequence) and
50 -CGAGGGCCCCTGCAGGTC-30 (vector sequence). The
absence of randomly integrated vector sequences was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using a neomycin probe.
Prior to injection into blastocysts, the left-arm recombination was confirmed by Southern blot analysis.
Two correctly targeted ES clones were injected into blastocysts from C57BL/6J mouse strain, and the blastocysts were
implanted in pseudopregnant females. Male chimeric progeny
were crossed with female C57BL/6J (in-house–bred) mice.
Germ line transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed
by Southern blot analysis, as described above for the right arm,
and for the left arm by PCR using: 50 -GTCCAACCTTTTGCCCCACATCT-30 and 50 -AATTGACCTGCAGGGGCCCTCG-30 ,

which generates an 3.5-kb band. Subsequent genotyping
was accomplished by PCR analysis of tail DNA using a
single-tube 3-primer reaction with 50 -CCTGCCTGCTGGAGACCAG-30 , 50 -CCCAGGTGTCAAGGCAACTG-30 , and 50 AATTGACCTGCAGGGGCCCTC-30 . The first 2 primers generate a 400-bp wild-type (WT) product, and the latter pair
generates a 200-bp product from the targeted allele. As
experiments proceeded using mixed-strain (C57BL/6J  129)
knockout (KO) mice, the Abcc10/ null allele was backcrossed for 8 generations onto the C57BL/6J background.
Antibody preparation and immunoblot analysis
A cDNA fragment encoding a.a. 1,443–1,491 of Abcc10 was
inserted into pGEX-T (Amersham Biosciences), and the resulting glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified using
glutathione beads according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Rabbits were immunized with the purified
recombinant protein, and the specificity of the resulting
antiserum was confirmed on membranes prepared from
ABCC10 baculovirus-infected cells. Abcc10 was detected in
kidney cells and spleen tissue using polyclonal antibody
(1:5,000) and an alkaline phosphatase–conjugated secondary
antibody (1:30,000). MRP7 antibody (P18, dilution 1:200; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and an alkaline phosphatase–conjugated
secondary antibody (1:2,000) were used for the mouse embryo
fibroblast (MEF) immunoblot. All of the cellular lysates prepared from cultured cells and spleen membrane fractions
were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters. All blots were incubated with
antibodies using the Millipore Snap ID system. b-Actin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was used at a concentration
of 1:5,000.
Cell line preparation and cellular assays
To prepare MEFs, mice (C57BL/6J  129 and C57BL/6J)
were set up in timed matings and, at day 13–14, embryos
were harvested. Embryos were minced, aspirated through a
1-mL syringe, and incubated in 0.25% trypsin for 15 minutes
at 37 C. The cells were spun down at 1,000 rpm for
5 minutes and cell pellets were resuspended in 10%
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and then
plated into flasks. Confluent cells were transfected with a
plasmid containing SV40-T antigen and a blasticidin resistance marker to select for immortal lines, as previously
described (16). Genetic veracity of MEFs was verified by
the Fox Chase Cancer Center Biomarker and Genotyping
facility every 2 months, and on defrosting new vials, using
genotyping and/or quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
Drug accumulation and cellular proliferation assays were
carried out as previously described (13, 17, 18). Vincristine,
paclitaxel, and Ara-C were purchased from Sigma Chemical
Company. [3H]Paclitaxel was purchased from Moravek.
Kidney cell line preparation
Kidneys isolated from WT and KO mice were finely minced
and placed in 10 mL of 0.02% collagenase and incubated for
2 hours at 37 C. The cells were washed 4 times with serumfree DMEM and then transferred into 1.6 mL of low-calcium

DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum in a swine gelatin–
coated flask (19). The next day, the supernatant was removed
and free-floating cells were transferred to another flask. The
resulting primary cultures were expanded and used for immunoblot analysis.
Sensitivity of mice to paclitaxel
For survival curves, WT and KO (C57/BL6  129) mice
were administered various concentrations of paclitaxel as a
single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection and monitored for morbidity. For experiments in which white blood cell counts and
body weight were analyzed, mice were administered a single
20-mg/kg i.p. injection of paclitaxel, and white blood cell
counts and body weight were measured daily for 6 days. Blood
samples were obtained by orbital bleeding, and white blood
cells were isolated using Zap-Oglobin II (Beckman) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. White blood cell counts
were analyzed using a Coulter Z1 Series cell and particle
counter (Beckman Coulter). Paclitaxel (LC Laboratories)
was dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 50 mg/mL
and filter-sterilized.
Animal handling, blood chemistries, and hematology
Animals were maintained in the Fox Chase Cancer Center
Laboratory Animal Facility and housed in a temperature- and
humidity-controlled environment under 12-hour light/dark
cycles. Mice were fed a standard rodent diet (Lab Diet
5013; PMI Nutrition) and had free access to water. The Fox
Chase Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–
approved protocol was followed for experiments. Peripheral
blood sample was obtained by orbital bleeding. Blood chemistry and hematologic variables were determined at Antech
Diagnostics.
Analysis of Abcc10 RNA expression in mouse tissues
Total RNA was isolated from various mouse tissues using
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
suggestions. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the M-MLV
reverse transcriptase and a mixture of anchored oligo-dT
primers and random decamers. Aliquots of cDNA were used
for qRT-PCR. The primer sequences GGGCAATTGGTCCGAACA, CTTGTTCCTTCTCAGCCCAGG, probe (6FAM)
TGAGATCCTGCCGCTGGTACAAGCTG(BHQ1) and PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) were used. Cycling conditions were 95 C, 15 minutes, followed by 40 cycles (95 C, 15
seconds; 60 C, 60 seconds). A 5-point, 4-fold dilution standard curve was used to convert the cycle threshold (Ct)
values into quantities. To compare transporter expression
levels, we normalized all mean quantity data to an independent gene Ppib (cyclophilin B). For these assays, 2 WT
and 2 Abcc10/ samples for spleen and thymus were
examined. Furthermore, 2 independent measurements were
taken for each sample.
Histopathologic analysis
Tissues were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin,
embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain.

Results
Generation of Abcc10/ mice
To examine the in vivo functions of Abcc10, an Abcc10/
null mouse was generated by homologous recombination in
ES cells. In the protein, the vector targeted a.a. 204–410,
which harbor most of nucleotide-binding domain 1 including the entire Walker B motif (Fig. 1A). Southern blot
(Fig. 1B) and PCR analysis (data not shown) confirmed
correct recombination, and Abcc10/ mice were derived.
Analysis of Abcc10 transcript expression in mouse tissues
revealed a wide distribution pattern, with highest levels in
testes, bladder, kidney, and ovary (Fig. 1C). On the basis of
the high levels of Abcc10 transcript in kidney, this tissue was
analyzed to evaluate loss of ABCC10 protein in Abcc10/
mice. Abcc10 protein was readily detected in primary kidney
cells lines isolated from WT mice but was undetectable in
kidney and spleen cells isolated from Abcc10/ null mice,
thus confirming the absence of Abcc10 protein in the KO
mice (Fig. 1D). In addition, loss of Abcc10 protein was
confirmed in the spleen. Abcc10/ null mice were normal
with respect to appearance, behavior, and fertility. Analysis
of a panel of hematopoietic and blood chemistry parameters
(Supplementary Table S1) and histopathologic analysis of
tissues did not reveal significant differences between WT
and Abcc10/ null mice.
Abcc10/ MEFs are hypersensitive to natural product
agents and Ara-C
MEF cell lines were generated from Abcc10/ null and WT
mice as a cellular model to study the protective function
of Abcc10. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of
Abcc10 protein in WT MEFs but not in MEFs derived from
Abcc10-KO mice (Fig. 2A). The cell lines were analyzed for
sensitivity toward representative anticancer agents that we
had previously determined as components of the human
ABCC10 drug resistance profile—paclitaxel, docetaxel, vincristine, and Ara-C (12, 13). Abcc10/ MEFs were hypersensitive
to each of these agents (Fig. 2B). The highest levels of
hypersensitivity were observed toward docetaxel, for which
Abcc10/ MEFs were 22.2-fold more sensitive than WT MEFs
(IC50 values of 0.59  0.22 nmol/L vs. 13.1  3.8 nmol/L, for
Abcc10/ and WT MEFs, respectively; P ¼ 0.031). For paclitaxel, vincristine, and Ara-C, Abcc10/ MEFs were 4.2-, 2.3-,
and 3.9-fold more sensitive than WT MEFs (IC50 values of
55.1  9.1, 29.2  5.3, and 48.9  10 nmol/L for Abcc10/
MEFs vs. 229  0.3, 66.0  15, and 191  27 nmol/L for WT
MEFs; P ¼ 0.004, 0.031, and 0.008, respectively).
Furthermore, the impact of genetic deficiency of Abcc10
was evaluated in the context of MEFs isolated from Abcc10/
mice that had been backcrossed to C57BL/6 (Fig. 2C). A
similar pattern of hypersensitivity was observed for this
genetic background, with Abcc10/ MEFs exhibiting 2.7-,
1.2-, and 3.9-fold increased sensitivity compared with WT
MEFs (IC50 values of 83.9  20, 219  5.6, and 127  22.3
nmol/L for Abcc10/ MEFs vs. 229  27, 258  12, and 501 
130 nmol/L for WT MEFs; P ¼ 0.0005, 0.016, and 0.016,
respectively).

targeting construct is designed to delete exons 6–8 (a.a. 204–332), which include the coding sequence of the entire Walker B motif required for ATPase activity,
and to cause a frameshift which results in a prematurely terminated Abcc10 protein. Proper recombination replaces 2.3 kb of Abcc10 sequence with the 1.8-kb
neomycin cassette and introduces an EcoRI site. Exons are shown as black rectangles. B, Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested DNA prepared from

To confirm that the increased sensitivity of Abcc10/
null MEFs was attributable to genetic deficiency of a drugefflux pump rather than secondary changes that might arise
as a consequence of the Abcc10/ lesion, the cellular
kinetics of paclitaxel accumulation and efflux were analyzed
(Fig. 2D). As expected, accumulation of paclitaxel in
Abcc10/ MEFs was significantly greater than in WT cells,
regardless of the background strain from which the MEFs
were derived. Following a 30-minute incubation in
0.1 mmol/L [3H]paclitaxel, accumulation in Abcc10/ MEFs
was increased by 44% and 63%, respectively, in C57BL/
6  129 and C57BL/6 Abcc10/ fibroblasts, compared with
their respective control cell lines (P ¼ 0.002 and P ¼ 0.002,
respectively). The accumulation deficit for paclitaxel was
greater for genetic deficiency of Abcc10 in MEFs on the
mixed genetic background than on the C57BL/6 background, in close concordance with the higher levels of
paclitaxel sensitization observed for Abcc10/ MEFs
on the mixed versus C57BL/6 background (Fig. 2). Representative dose–response curves for docetaxel, paclitaxel,
vincristine, and Ara-C using Abcc10/ and WT MEFs
derived from the C57BL/6J  129 strain are shown in Fig.
3A–D. Increased sensitivity was observed for Abcc10/

MEFs compared with WT MEFs for paclitaxel (Fig. 3A),
docetaxel (Fig. 3B), vincristine (Fig. 3C), and Ara-C (Fig. 3D).
Abcc10/ mice are hypersensitive to paclitaxel
Having determined from the in vitro experiments described
in the preceding sections that genetic deficiency of Abcc10
confers cellular sensitivity to a range of agents including
taxanes, the in vivo pharmacologic functions of Abcc10 were
investigated next by challenging Abcc10/ and WT mice with
paclitaxel. Sensitivity to paclitaxel was markedly increased in
Abcc10/ mice, as indicated by the striking separation of the
dose–response curves (Fig. 4A). The minimal toxic dose for
Abcc10/ mice was 32 mg/kg compared with 150 mg/kg for
WT mice, which is 5-fold higher than that of Abcc10/
mice. Only 33% of the Abcc10/ mice survived at a 160 mg/kg
dose, whereas 100% of WT mice survived at this dose. At 250
mg/kg, 100% of Abcc10/ mice died, whereas 80% of WT mice
survived.
Body weight and white blood cell counts were analyzed in
mice challenged with paclitaxel (Fig. 4B and C). Although
the intention in this experiment was to select a dosage that
was sublethal (20 mg/kg), significant morbidity was
observed. Presumably, this was attributable to stress

increased sensitivity of Abcc10/ mice toward paclitaxel
was reflected in both body weight and white blood cell
parameters. WT mice lost no more than 10% of body weight
and eventually recovered, whereas Abcc10/ mice lost up
to 20% of body weight. In WT mice, depression of white

result of Abcc10 knockdown. Furthermore, the levels of
Abcc2, Abcc6, and Abcc9 in these tissues were too low to
draw conclusions. Overall, there were no strong compensatory changes based on the Abcc10 phenotype.

Discussion
Abcc10 protects bone marrow, spleen, and thymus
Histopathologic analysis of WT and Abcc10/ mice treated with paclitaxel revealed significant changes in hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues in Abcc10/ mice, whereas the
corresponding tissues in WT mice appeared to be little
changed. Marked hypoplasia was seen in the bone marrow
of Abcc10/ mice, whereas WT mice exhibited minimal or
no changes (Fig. 5A). Abcc10/ null mice had smaller
spleens in which the lymphoid follicles (white pulp) were
diminished in number and size (Fig. 5B). In addition, erythroid and myeloid cell populations in the red pulp were
decreased and replaced by histiocytes and stromal cells. In
Abcc10/ mice, the cortex of the thymus was decreased in
size in association with lymphocyte apoptosis and/or
depopulation (Fig. 5C). To gain further insight into these

In previous studies, we found that ectopic expression of
ABCC10 confers resistance to taxanes, Vinca alkaloids, and a
range of nucleoside analogues such as Ara-C (12, 13). Among
these agents, taxanes were of particular interest to us because
of the paucity of efflux pumps, other than P-gp, that are
established cellular resistance factors for this class of clinically
important agents. Indeed, the importance of P-gp in resistance
to taxanes, and the potential for ABCC10 to function as a
resistance factor for this class of agents, was highlighted by the
extraordinarily high levels of resistance ABCC10 can confer
toward paclitaxel and docetaxel (116- and 46-fold, respectively) when it was ectopically expressed in P-gp–deficient
fibroblasts (13). In view of the intriguing activities of ABCC10
in studies on transfected cells, the present study was

undertaken to investigate the potential for the pump to
function as an in vivo resistance factor.
In this study, it is shown by the analysis of Abcc10/
fibroblasts that the pump contributes to inherent cellular
resistance toward each of the classes of anticancer agents
that we identified in the context of transfected HEK-293 cells,
including the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel (12, 13).
Importantly, the results of experiments on Abcc10/ MEFs,
in combination with the finding that Abcc10/ mice are
hypersensitive to paclitaxel, provide the first evidence that the
pump can function as an in vivo resistance factor. In addition,
analysis of the tissue-specific pattern of toxicity provides
insights into how genetic deficiency of Abcc10 contributes
to paclitaxel hypersensitivity. Neutropenia in conjunction with
marked bone marrow hypoplasia indicate that the pump
affords protection against paclitaxel-induced bone marrow
toxicity and suggest that reduced immunity is a significant
component of morbidity in the Abcc10/ null mice challenged with this agent. This is a noteworthy finding because
bone marrow toxicity is the principal acute side effect of
paclitaxel in humans. Additional insights into the contribution
of Abcc10 to in vivo resistance will require studies on the
impact of the pump on pharmacokinetics and associated

determinations of the polarity and expression of Abcc10 in
tissues involved in drug disposition.
Although ABCC10 has been reported to have a wide pattern
of transcript expression in human (13) and mouse tissues
(present study), relatively little information is available on its
expression in tumors and its susceptibility to induction under
drug pressure. In a small survey involving 8 samples, the
ABCC10 transcript was detected in breast, lung, colon, prostate, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers (20). Another study
described the expression of ABCC10 transcript in 12 of 17
non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and reported
that expression correlates with resistance of the cell lines to
paclitaxel (21). With respect to inducibility, upregulation of
ABCC10 transcript has been reported for a few cell lines made
resistant to classes of microtubule active agents that we had
previously determined to be part of the drug resistance profile
of the pump. Upregulation of ABCC10 transcript was reported
for a small-cell lung cancer cell line made resistant to paclitaxel, a NSCLC cell line with acquired resistance to vinorelbine, and a salivary gland adenocarcinoma cell line made
resistant to vincristine (21–23). More information is needed on
expression of ABCC10 in tumor samples, and, in particular, on
tumors treated with taxanes and Vinca alkaloids.
Furthermore, although efflux-pump inhibitors have yet to be
established as a clinical strategy for sensitizing tumors to
chemotherapeutic agents, the determination here that the
genetic deficiency of Abcc10 is not associated with obvious
health problems indicates that the normal physiologic func-

tions of the murine pump are not essential and suggests that
ABCC10 inhibitors could potentially be used in humans without side effects attributable to interference with normal functions of the pump. Several inhibitors of ABCC10 have been
identified, including cepharanthine, lapatinib, and nilotinib
(17, 24, 25). These compounds could serve as starting points
for the development of potent and selective ABCC10 inhibitors.
