Abstract
A broadly accepted standard treatment for adult T-lymphoblastic lymphoma
(T-LBL) has not yet been defined. To address that issue, we retrospectively compared
three chemotherapy regimens used to treat 110 adult patients with newly diagnosed
T-LBL. These included two adult regimens (ECOG2993 and hyper-CVAD) and a childhood
regimen (BFM-90). These intensive drug regimens are mainly used to treat childhood
and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. They included induction, consolidation, and
maintenance chemotherapy protocols and were administered over the course of
2 years. Seventy-five patients (80%) achieved a complete remission (CR). Within a
median follow-up time of 31 months (range: 5–152 months), the 5-year overall survival
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 47.7% (95% CI, 35.0–69.8%)
and 45.7% (95% CI, 27.6–56.6%), respectively. Shorter survival was associated
with age > 40 years, poor ECOG PS and bone marrow involvement. Elevated lactic
dehydrogenase (LDH) level, Ann Arbor stage and International Prognostic Index (IPI)
score had no prognostic value. The childhood chemotherapy regimen improved CR
and the overall survival rate more than the adult regimen in patients aged < 40 years.

Introduction

B-phenotype, elevated LDH, IPI and central nervous
system (CNS) involvement, has varied among trials [2, 3].
Cytogenetic abnormalities show no prognostic value in
adult, though they are related to an aggressive clinic course.
No chromosomal or molecular abnormalities have been
consistently shown to carry prognostic significance except
t (9;17) (q34;3), which is associated with an aggressive
clinical course in children [4, 5].
At our cancer center, doctors have treated LBL
patients using several different chemotherapy regimens,
including the hyper-CVAD, ECOG E2993 and BFM-90
protocols. The purpose of this retrospective study was to
further analyze the clinical characteristics and biological
and prognostic factors in T-LBL, and to evaluate the
regimens used to treat adult (hyper-CVAD and ECOG
E2993) and childhood (BFM-90) T-LBL. We then sought

T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) represents less
than 2% of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), but
accounts for 85% to 90% of all lymphoblastic lymphomas
[1]. This high-grade lymphoma occurs mostly in males,
with a high incidence of mediastinal tumors and several
distinct clinical signs, including cough, shortness of breath,
respiratory distress, and/or superior vena cava (SVC)
syndrome [1]. At one time, LBL and acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) were considered to be the same disease due
to the similarity of their biological characteristics. However,
the two diseases have different clinical presentations and
treatment responses. No reliable risk factors or prognostic
factors have been identified for adult patients with T-LBL,
though the impact of several potential risk factors, including

received second-line treatment similar to ALL chemotherapy.
Among that group, only 4 patients achieved CR.
We also analyzed the long survival outcomes of
27 patients who relapsed after a median of 13 months
(range: 8.8–56 months). Among this group, 11 presented
with recurrence in the mediastinum, four with recurrence
in the BM, and one with lymph node recurrence. Eleven
patients showed recurrence in both the mediastinum and
BM. All of these patients had mediastinal involvement at
diagnosis but never received mediastinal irradiation. No
CNS recurrence was observed in this study. The relapsed
patients were treated with various intensive chemotherapy
regimens, and four achieved a second CR. Among the
27 relapsed patients, eight underwent high dose
chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation,
and seven received allogeneic BM transplantation.
Three patients are in continuing CR after allogeneic BM
transplantation.

Results
Patient characteristics
The main clinical characteristics of the 110 patients
are presented in Table 1. The median age was 28 years
(range: 18–65 years) with 80% under 40 years. The
male:female ratio was 7:3. Eighty-three patients (75%)
had a good ECOG PS of 0–1. Using the Ann Arbor
staging system, 90 patients (81%) presented with stage III
or IV disease. B symptoms were reported in 43 patients
(39%) at diagnosis. Nighty-three patients (85%) had a
mediastinal mass. Bone marrow (BM) involvement was
common, occurring in 55% of all patients. LDH levels
were frequently elevated. Based on IPI scores, more
than half of the patients had low or low-to-moderate risk
disease. The comparative baseline characteristics of all
patients with respect to administration of childhood and
adult regimens are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
There were no significant differences in the frequency of
these characteristics between the two treatment regimens.

Univariate and multivariate analyses
Univariate analysis showed that receiving adult
regimen chemotherapy, age, ECOG PS, mediastinal mass
and BM involvement were all significantly predictive
of shorter OS and PFS (Table 3). No other factors were
predictive of outcome. Clinical factors that were statistically
significant predictors of OS in univariate analysis were
included in a multivariate analysis, which revealed that
receiving adult regimen chemotherapy, age, ECOG PS and
BM involvement were independent prognostic factors for
PFS and OS (Table 3). However, mediastinal mass failed to
be prognostic under multivariate analysis.

Treatment response and survival
Within a median follow-up time of 31months
(range: 5–152 months), the 5-year OS and PFS rates for
all patients were 47.7% (95% CI, 35.0–69.8%) and 45.7%
(95% CI, 27.6–56.6%), respectively (Figure 1A and 1B).
Eighty percent of these LBL patients achieved CR, while
15.5% achieved PR. Patients who achieved CR after two
cycles of chemotherapy had a significantly better PFS and
OS than those without CR (Figure 1C and 1D).
All patients received intensive treatment regimens,
including the childhood regimen BFM 90 (68 patients)
and two adult regimens, ECOG E2993 (14 patients)
and hyper-CVAD (28 patients). Responses to treatment
are summarized in Table 2. There were no significant
differences in the response rates among the three
treatment regimens. On the other hand, significant
differences in the 5-year OS and PFS rates were observed
(OS, p = 0.015; PFS, p = 0.034). Among all patients
receiving the childhood regimen, the OS rate was 62.6%,
but was 38.6% among those receiving an adult regimen
(Figure 2A and 2B). Subgroup analysis showed that among
patients younger than 40 years, the 5-year OS and PFS rates
(OS, p = 0.02;PFS, p = 0.04) for the adult regimens was
again inferior to those for the childhood regimen (Figure 3A
and 3B). On the other hand, the survival outcomes for the
adult and childhood regimens were similar among patients
aged ≥ 40 years (Figure 3C and 3D). Five patients (4.5%)
who died early during induction had persistent progressive
disease. Seventeen patients had progressive disease and

Toxicity
All the patients exhibited III/IV grade
myelosuppression during remission induction. Two
patients exhibited tumor lysis syndrome. No treatmentrelated mortality was observed.

Discussion
The high-grade NHL protocol and the ALL
chemotherapy regimen reportedly produce 5-year survival
rates of less than 50% among adults with T-LBL [1, 6]. On
the other hand, the German BFM group, who studied 105
children given ALL-type regimens, estimated the 5-year
EFS to be 90% [7]. For T-LBL patients, it appears that
the adult ALL chemotherapy regimen always produced
poorer outcomes in adults than were achieved in children
receiving the childhood regimen, but there were no direct
comparisons between the efficacies of childhood and adult
ALL regimens in adults with LBL.
This report describes the results achieved among
110 adult T-LBL patients treated with the childhood
ALL regimen (BFM-90) or one of two adult regimens

(ECOG E2993 or hyper-CVAD). With these approaches,
a CR rate of 80% for all patients was obtained, which
is comparable to the 80–90% rates previously reported
with ALL regimens. The 5-year OS and PFS rates for
all patients were 47.7% and 45.7%, respectively, but the
childhood ALL regimen produced significantly better PFS
and OS rates than the two adult regimens. Based on a Cox
regression model that included multiple clinical prognostic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

factors, we concluded that receiving the adult regimen as
chemotherapy, age, ECOG PS and BM involvement were
independent prognostic factors affecting both PFS and OS.
The clinical characteristics of the T-LBL
patients analyzed in the present study were similar to
those previously described by others: patients were
predominantly young and male with frequent mediastinal
involvement [3, 8]. However, BM involvement occurred

38886

in our cohort more frequently than in other series [3, 9],
while our observed absence of CNS involvement also
differed from other studies. These differences may be
explained by the selection of patients for this retrospective
analysis after review of the pathological diagnosis.
As summarized in Table 2, the CR rates achieved
with the childhood ALL regimen (BFM-90) appeared
higher than those achieved with the ECOG E2993
or hyper-CVAD regimen, but the difference was not
significant. The outcome with the hyper-CVAD regimen
in LBL was first reported by Thomas et al. [2], while
Sekimizu et al. reported that among their patients,
30 (91%) achieved CR, and 3 (9%) achieved PR [5]. But
it appears that in our study patients treated with the hyperCVAD regimen had a poorer prognosis, which may be
explained by the too small sample size.
In the subgroup analysis, we found the patients
aged < 40 years (Figure 3) receiving the childhood
regimen had better OS and PFS rates than those receiving
an adult regimen. However, the older patients did not
benefit from the childhood regimen as much as from the

adult regimens. This result was similar to what has been
seen in ALL patients, in whom pediatric regimens were
shown to be favorable for Ph negative AYA ALL patients
[10–13]. Patients aged 15–40 years – i.e., adolescent and
young adult (AYA) – often tolerated the side effects of
more intensive ALL regimens better than adults (aged
≥ 40 years), as they had fewer underlying diseases such
as hypertension, heart disease and diabetes. Studies have
confirmed that the childhood ALL regimen improves
survival in AYA patients with ALL because the cumulated
doses of vincristine, steroids and asparaginase in the
childhood ALL regimen (e.g., BFM-90) are significantly
higher than in adult regimens (e.g., ECOG E2993 or
hyper-CVAD). On the contrary, treatment-related toxicity
partially offset the improvement brought by the dose
escalation of non-cellulotoxic anticancer drugs in patients
aged > 40 years [12].
Although prophylactic irradiation of the CNS was
not administered to patients in the present study, no patient
experienced relapse with CNS involvement after treatment.

neither Ann Arbor stage nor LDH level influenced OS
or PFS. In addition, Hoelzer et al. [16] reported the
inability of the IPI index to predict LBL outcome. Thus,
a convincing prognostic model for adult T-LBL has yet
to be defined. In our study, multivariate analysis revealed
that age, ECOG PS and BM involvement at diagnosis are
independent prognostic factors affecting OS and PFS,
which is consistent with the observation reported by Morel
et al. [3] that 40 years of age appears to be a cut-off for
OS. In sum, our study is one of the largest conducted on
adult T-LBL patients (n = 110) treated with different ALLtype chemotherapy regimens (ECOG E2993, hyper-CVAD
and BFM-90). The childhood regimen appeared to give
better OS rates than the adult regimens in patients aged
< 40 years, and age, ECOG PS and BM involvement at
diagnosis were independent prognosis factors affecting
OS and PFS. Future prospective studies will required to

were CNS-negative did not benefit from prophylactic
cranial radiotherapy [14]. In our study, high-dose MTX in
the drug regimens and regular intrathecal chemotherapy
may have contributed to reducing the incidence of CNS
involvement [15]. Three patients achieved continuous CR
after allogeneic BM transplantation following induction
therapy. The efficacy of stem cell transplantation for LBL
is controversial, since chemotherapy reportedly achieves
a survival rate similar [1].
Some prognostic factors that have been found
to significantly affect the survival of patients with LBL
include age, stage IV disease, high LDH level and anemia
[3, 8, 9, 16, 17]. In the German Multicentre Trials for
Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) series on
T-LBL, the only significant prognostic factor for survival
was elevated LDH [16]. In the MDACC series [2], only
CNS involvement at diagnosis was significantly associated
with poorer outcome. In the present study, however,

Statistical analysis

Patient selection

OS was calculated from the time of diagnosis
until death from any cause or until the time of the last
follow-up visit by the surviving patients. PFS was defined
as the interval from the initiation of chemotherapy to
the time of the first documented disease progression or
recurrence, or from chemotherapy initiation to the last
follow-up visit. The Chi-square test was used to calculate
statistical group comparisons of categorical variables.
Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier
method, with comparisons made using the log-rank
test. Multivariate analysis with a Cox regression model
was used to estimate the prognostic impact of different
variables on OS and PFS. The variables that were included
in a multivariate analysis were statistically significant in
univariate analyses. Values of P < 0.05 was considered
significant, and all P-values corresponded to two-sided
tests. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
16.0 software.

Selected for this study were 110 patients with
pathologically proven adult T-LBL diagnosed between
August 2000 and June 2015 at the Sun Yat-Sen University
Cancer Center. The histology and immunophenotype
were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis based on
World Health Organization guidelines. The criteria
for case inclusion were: (1) histologically confirmed
diagnosis of T-LBL; (2) T-LBL cell type confirmed using
immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry; (3) no previous
malignancy; (4) no previous treatment for lymphoma; and
(5) adequate clinical information and follow-up data. The
clinical data included the following information: patient
demographics, physical examination, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), B
symptoms, serum LDH, BM examinations, computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
of the involved field, or whole body positron emission
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). All patients
were staged according to the Ann Arbors stage system
[18], as calculated using the IPI [19]. BM involvement was
defined as more than 5% blast cells in the BM. Patients
who had more than 25% blasts in the BM were defined as
T-ALL and excluded from this study. CNS involvement
was evaluated using lumbar puncture at the time of
diagnostic workup. CNS involvement was defined as ≥ 5
WBCs/mcl in the cerebrospinal fluid, with the presence
of lymphoblasts. Both the Institutional Review Board and
Ethics Committees of Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer
Center approved this study. All patients consented to allow
their medical records be used for research purposes.

The numbers of patients who received each
chemotherapy regimen are summarized in Table 2. All
details of the chemotherapy regimens have been reported
previously [2, 7, 20]. The treatment response was assessed
after every administration cycle. CR was defined as
the disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease,
normalization of all laboratory abnormalities related to
the lymphoma, and normalization of radiographic images
and biopsies that had been abnormal before therapy. PR
was defined as regression of the tumor burden by > 50%.
Tumor volume regression of < 50% and progressive
disease were considered to be failures. After completing
their treatment, patients were followed up and assessed by
their oncologist in our outpatient department. Each followup visit consisted of a physical examination; complete
blood count; serum biochemistry, including LDH levels;
BM examination; and a whole body CT scan. Follow-up
visits were conducted every 3 months for the first 2 years
following treatment, every 6 months for the next 3 years,
and annually after the initial 5 years.
