Abstract
Trastuzumab is an iconic rationally designed targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancers. However,
the low response rate and development of resistance call for novel approaches for the treatment of patients.
Here, we report that concurrent targeting of tumor cells and activation of T cells in the tumor
microenvironment results in a synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor growth and overcomes resistance
in two distinct PTEN loss–mediated trastuzumab-resistant mammary tumor mouse models. In vivo
combination treatment with HER2/Neu antibody and Akt inhibitor triciribine effectively inhibited tumor
growth in both models via inhibiting PI3K/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling accompanied by increased T-cell inﬁltration in the tumor microenvironment. We showed that both CD8þ and
CD4þ T cells were essential to the optimal antitumor effect of this combination treatment in an IFNg–dependent manner. Importantly, the antitumor activities of HER2/Neu antibody and triciribine combination treatment were further improved when coinhibitory receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated
antigen 4 was blocked to enhance the T-cell response. Our data indicate that multitargeted combinatorial
therapies targeting tumor cells and concomitantly enhancing T-cell response in the tumor microenvironment
could cooperate to exert maximal therapeutic activity, suggesting a promising clinical strategy for treating
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancers and other advanced malignancies. Cancer Res; 72(17); 4417–28. 2012

Introduction
Rationally designed targeted therapies are sorely needed
in the new era of personalized cancer medicine (1, 2). HER2/
ErbB2 or neu is overexpressed in 20% to 30% of breast
cancers and is associated with aggressive disease and poor
clinical outcomes. HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that
promotes cell survival and proliferation by activating multiple pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT pathway and the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a
humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the extra-

cellular domain of HER2, has shown remarkable clinical
efﬁcacy in HER2-positive breast cancer (3–8). In addition
to inhibition of HER2 signaling, the therapeutic effect of
trastuzumab also depends on immune-mediated mechanisms. Several studies have shown that antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity mediated by Fc receptor–expressing
innate immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and
monocytes are essential to trastuzumab's antitumor activity
(3–8). A recent study showed that HER2/Neu antibody
treatment also requires adaptive immune response to
achieve maximal therapeutic effects (7).
Despite the reported efﬁcacy of trastuzumab-containing
regimens in treatment of early- and advanced-stage breast
cancer, a signiﬁcant number of patients fail to respond to
initial trastuzumab treatment (de novo resistance) and many
trastuzumab-responsive tumors develop resistance after continuous treatment (acquired resistance; refs. 9, 10). Hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is a major trastuzumab
resistance mechanism (11, 12). We previously ﬁrst reported
that loss of PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT pathway,
conferred trastuzumab resistance through enhanced PI3K/
AKT signaling in HER2-overexpressing breast cancers (13).
Studies in 2 other different patient cohorts further validated
that activation of the PI3K/AKT axis, deﬁned as PTEN loss or
PI3K catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) gain-of-function mutations,
correlated with worse response to trastuzumab (14, 15). These

ﬁndings suggest that targeting PI3K/AKT may overcome trastuzumab resistance.
We previously found that the combination of trastuzumab
with a small-molecule Akt inhibitor triciribine could restore
trastuzumab sensitivity in PTEN-deﬁcient tumor cells in vitro
and in a xenograft model in severe combined immunodeﬁciency mice (16). However, over the past years, it has increasingly been recognized that most cancer drugs developed on the
basis of cell culture and xenograft studies have not translated
well into the clinic. One potential possibility is that cell culture
and xenograft models lack the appropriate tumor microenvironment and host immune system, which compromises their
ability to fully recapitulate the behavior of the human malignant cells. It is recognized that immune cells in the tumor
microenvironment play critical roles in tumor development
and in determining the therapeutic response to anticancer
treatment as well (17–20). Hence, genetically engineered
mouse (GEM) models that develop tumors in an immunocompetent setting and better mimic the initiation and progression
of human cancer could circumvent the shortcomings of traditional models and may be more suitable for preclinical
investigations, especially in regards to immune functions
(21, 22).
In the present study, we tested whether immune response is
functionally essential in overcoming trastuzumab resistance
using GEM models. We report that HER2/Neu antibody and
Akt inhibitor triciribine combination treatment effectively
inhibits tumor growth in 2 PTEN loss–mediated HER2/Neu
antibody–resistant breast cancer models. In addition to inhibiting PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling, the combination treatment increases T-cell inﬁltration, including both CD8þ and
CD4þ T cells into the tumor microenvironment, which contribute to the optimal antitumor effect of this combination
treatment. Enhancement of T-cell response by blockade of
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4, also
known as CD152), a coinhibitory receptor that decreases T-cell
activation, further improves the antitumor activity of HER2/
Neu antibody and triciribine combination treatment. Our data
imply that multitargeted combinatorial therapies inhibiting
tumor cells and enhancing immune cell response in the tumor
microenvironment cooperates to promote maximal therapeutic effect.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
3T3 and 3T3/Neu B7.1 cells were provided by Dr. E.M.
Jaffee (Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins and
the Viragh Pancreatic Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD) 3 weeks
before the assay; Neu expression was conﬁrmed by ﬂow
cytometry.
Animals
MMTV-NIC (Neu-IRES-Cre) mice (23) were interbred with
Flox-PTEN mice to generate HER2/Neu overexpression–PTEN
heterozygous loss (PTENþ//NIC) and homozygous loss
(PTEN//NIC) mice (24). ErbB2KI mice (25), MMTV-Cre mice
(25), and Flox-PTEN mice were interbred to generate PTEN/
/ErbB2KI mice (26). All animal studies were approved by the

Animal Care and Use Committee.
In vivo treatment
Anti-HER2/neu mAb 7.16.4 was produced in house using
hybridoma obtained from Dr. Mark Greene (University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). PTENþ/þ/NIC, PTENþ/
/NIC, and PTEN//NIC mice were randomized to indicated
treatments when ﬁrst palpable tumor was 3 to 5 mm in
diameter. 7.16.4 mAb and Akt inhibitor triciribine (Berry &
Associates) were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 2
mg/kg body weight every 3 days and 1 mg/kg in PBS daily,
respectively. Mice were sacriﬁced after treatment for 3
weeks and tumors were harvested and weighted. PTEN/
/ErbB2KI mice were randomized to indicated treatment
when tumors reached the size of 150 to 300 mm3. 7.16.4
mAb (1 mg/kg, every 3 days) and triciribine (1 mg/kg, daily)
were administered, and the tumors were measured twice
weekly using calipers and the volume was calculated by
length  width2/2. CD8-depleting antibody (53.6.7) or CD4depleting antibody (GK1.5) or both was injected (150 mg per
mouse, i.p.) every 3 days, starting 1 day before Ab and
triciribine treatment. For the IFN-g neutralization, 150 mg
antibody (R4-6A2) was injected at the same time as Ab
treatment. Anti-CTLA-4 antibody (9H10) was injected (150
mg per mouse) every 3 days alone or together with Ab or/and
triciribine treatment.

Results
PTEN loss leads to hyperactivation of Akt and confers
resistance to anti-HER2/Neu antibody treatment in
HER2/Neu-overexpressing mammary tumors
Our laboratory has previously shown that PTEN activation contributes to the antitumor activity of trastuzumab
and PTEN loss leads to trastuzumab resistance (13–15). To
ascertain PTEN is critical for the antitumor activity of
trastuzumab directly, we generated Neu-overexpressing
mammary tumor mouse models with different PTEN levels
by genetic modiﬁcation and tested the tumor response to
HER2/Neu mAb (7.16.4 mAb) that binds the mouse and rat
Neu at the same site as trastuzumab binds to human HER2
(27). Consistent with prior ﬁndings, heterozygous or homozygous loss of PTEN accelerates Neu-induced mammary
tumorigenesis (Supplementary Fig. S1). PTEN loss also
leads to increased Akt phosphorylation in mammary
tumors (Fig. 1A). We then treated mice with 7.16.4 mAb.
Compared with the control (PBS) group, antibody treatment for 3 weeks signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth in
PTENþ/þ/NIC mice (P ¼ 0.0001) and PTENþ//NIC mice (P
¼ 0.0008), but not in PTEN//NIC mice (P ¼ 0.2327; Fig.
1B). Furthermore, 7.16.4 treatment inhibited both AKT and
ERK phosphorylation in mammary tumors of PTENþ/þ/NIC
mice, but did not inhibit Akt phosphorylation in PTEN/
/NIC mice (Fig. 1C). These results show that PTEN loss
leads to hyperactivation of Akt and confers resistance to
HER2/Neu antibody treatment in mammary tumors of
genetically engineered Neu-overexpressing PTEN loss
PTEN//NIC mice.

HER2/Neu antibody and Akt inhibitor triciribine
combination treatment effectively inhibits Neu
overexpression–PTEN loss mammary tumors
On the basis of our previous ﬁndings (16), we next investigated whether addition of the Akt inhibitor triciribine could
overcome 7.16.4 mAb resistance in the aggressive spontaneous
mammary tumor model of PTEN//NIC mice. Combination
treatment with 7.16.4 antibody and triciribine signiﬁcantly
decreased tumor burden (P < 0.001; Fig. 2A) and multiplicity
(P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S2A) compared with control,
antibody alone, or triciribine alone, whereas antibody or
triciribine alone had no signiﬁcant effect on tumor growth
and multiplicity. Combination treatment also reduced lung
metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S2B). We then examined the
effects of antibody, triciribine, or combination treatment on
PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling (Fig. 2C). Single treatment with
antibody decreased pErk but not pAkt; triciribine alone mod-

estly decreased pAkt but produced no signiﬁcant inhibition on
pErk, whereas combination treatment reduced both pAkt
and pErk. Histologic assessment showed large areas of
cell loss or necrosis in tumors with combination treatment
(Fig. 3A). Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis
showed dramatically lower percentage of proliferating cells,
more apoptotic cells, and fewer blood vessels in combinationtreated tumors compared with antibody or triciribine alone–
treated tumors (Fig. 3B–D). These data indicate that combination treatment with HER2/Neu antibody and the Akt
inhibitor triciribine effectively inhibits tumor growth, angiogenesis, and induces tumor cell death in PTEN//NIC mice.
Considering that PTEN//NIC mouse models use a strong
viral promoter to drive an activated Neu expression, they may
not best simulate human breast cancer. Therefore, we extended our studies in the PTEN//ErbB2KI model, which has
physiologic levels of human HER2/ErbB2 expression and PTEN

the PTEN//NIC model displays molecular characteristics of
the luminal subtype of primary human breast cancer, whereas
PTEN//ErbB2KI tumors display striking morphologic heterogeneity with features of both basal-like and HER2 human
breast cancer (24, 26). Therefore, evaluation and/or comparison of the therapeutic efﬁcacy in these 2 model systems could
provide more insights for the development of potential treatments for human breast cancer.
Similar to the results seen in PTEN//NIC mice, combination treatment resulted in signiﬁcant inhibition of
tumor growth compared with antibody or triciribine monotherapy in PTEN//ErbB2KI mice (P < 0.001; Fig. 2B).
Remarkably, mice with combination treatment developed
only small tumors even after 7 weeks, whereas single treatment mice had to be sacriﬁced after 4 weeks because of

excessive tumor burden. These data suggest that combination treatment induces rapid and sustained tumor suppression. Furthermore, treatment of PTEN//ErbB2KI mice led
to signiﬁcant inhibition of pAKT and pERK compared with
individual treatments with antibody or triciribine or control
(Fig. 2D). Consistently, histologic and IHC analysis of
tumors derived from PTEN//ErbB2KI mice also revealed
that combination treatment led to a signiﬁcantly increased
necrosis area, reduced proliferation, reduced blood vessels,
and an enhanced level of apoptosis compared with individual treatments (Supplementary Fig. S3). Together, data from
these 2 different spontaneous breast cancer models show
that the combination of HER2/Neu antibody with Akt inhibitor triciribine could overcome PTEN loss–mediated HER2/
Neu antibody (trastuzumab equivalent) resistance in mammary tumors.

Combination treatment increases T-cell inﬁltration into
tumor microenvironment
When conducting histologic examination, we observed,
strikingly, that lymphocyte/leukocyte-like cells were highly
inﬁltrated into tumors of both PTEN//NIC and PTEN/
/ErbB2KI mice after combination treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S4). It is known that the antitumor effect of trastuzumab
partly depends on immune-mediated mechanisms (3–8), and
activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is a mechanism for tumor
immune evasion, which can be reversed by Akt inhibition (28).
These observations led us to ask whether the immune response
contributes to the potent antitumor effect of the combination
treatment against PTEN loss–induced HER2/Neu antibody–
resistant mammary tumors. Initially, we assessed what types of
immune cells might be altered upon combination treatment.
First, we quantiﬁed expression of markers for speciﬁc types of

www.aacrjournals.org

immune cells by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
(qRT-PCR). Compared with Ctrl, Ab, and triciribine single
treatment, combination treatment signiﬁcantly increased
(>3-fold, P < 0.01) CD3e and CD8a mRNAs in tumors from both
PTEN//NIC and PTEN//ErbB2KI mice; combination
treatment also increased the CD4 mRNA level in both models
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4A and B). Expression of markers of other types of
immune cells, such as B220 (B cells), F4/80 (macrophages),
NK1.1 (NK cells), and CXCR1 (neutrophils), were either not
signiﬁcantly altered or not consistently altered in the 2 models
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, we focused on CD3þ T
cells as well as the CD8þ and CD4þ subtypes. IHC staining
showed a marked increase of CD3þ lymphocytes present in
combination-treated tumors in both PTEN//NIC (Fig. 4C)
and PTEN//ErbB2KI mice (Fig. 4D). IHC staining also
revealed greater numbers of CD8þ and CD4þ T cells within

Cotargeting Tumor and T Cells Overcomes Trastuzumab Resistance

the combination-treated tumors of PTEN//NIC mice (Fig.
4E and F). To better quantify these differences, freshly excised
tumors from PTEN//NIC mice were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry for CD4þ and CD8þ T cells. Higher CD4þ and CD8þ
populations were detected in combination-treated tumors
(Fig. 4G). Collectively, these results show that antibody
and triciribine combination treatment increases intratumoral
T-cell (both CD4þ and CD8þ) inﬁltration.
Antibody and triciribine combination treatment
enhance antitumor immunity
CD8þ CTLs are crucial components of adaptive immunity
that suppresses tumor growth (29). CD4þ T cells are divided
into multiple subtypes that play distinct roles during tumorigenesis and progression, including Th1, Th2, Th17, T regulatory cells (Treg), and natural killer T (NKT) cells (29, 30). Th1
polarization promotes CTLs-mediated killing of cancer cells
and tumor regression. In contrast, Th2-polarized immune
responses promote tumor progression mainly through cytokine production (31). Therefore, we examined the expression
proﬁle of known Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Tumors from combination-treated mice had signiﬁcantly elevated mRNA levels
of IFN-g, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-12 (Th1 cytokines; P < 0.01),
but not IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-b (Th2 cytokines) when compared
with those of control, antibody, or triciribine single–treated
tumors, in both PTEN//NIC (Fig. 5A) and PTEN//ErbB2KI
mice (Fig. 5B). In addition, combination treatment also signiﬁcantly reduced VEGFa mRNA expression (Fig. 5A and B),
which promotes angiogenesis (32) and immune suppression
(33). We also measured cytokine levels by ELISA using tumor
lysates from PTEN//NIC mice with different treatment.
Consistent with mRNA data, IFN-g and IL-2 cytokine protein
levels were signiﬁcantly increased, whereas IL-4 and IL-10 were
not signiﬁcantly changed (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that
combination treatment induced a dominant antitumor Th1
polarization in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, splenocytes from combination–treated mice showed a signiﬁcant
increase in CTL activity against Neu-overexpressing 3T3 target
cells compared with the other 3 treatment groups (P < 0.01),
whereas splenocytes among 4 groups had no signiﬁcant difference in lytic effect against 3T3 cells without Neu overexpression (Fig. 5D). These results indicate that combined
treatment with HER2/Neu antibody and triciribine effectively
induces Neu-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell response. Taken together,
antibody and triciribine combination treatment enhances
antitumor immunity associated with Th1 polarization and
Neu-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell response.
The optimal antitumor effect of the combination
treatment requires CD8þ, CD4þ T cells, and IFN-g
We have shown that combination treatment inhibited
tumor growth with increased intratumor inﬁltration of
CD8þ and CD4þ T lymphocytes. To determine whether
CD8þ or/and CD4þ T cells are critical for the antitumor effect
of combination treatment, PTEN//NIC mice were simultaneously treated with anti-CD8a antibody or/and anti-CD4
antibody to deplete the CD8þ and CD4þ T lymphocytes
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). Depletion of CD8aþ or CD4þ or

www.aacrjournals.org

both T cells during combination treatment resulted in reduced
tumor suppression. Compared with PBS-treated control group,
concurrent CD8a and CD4 depletion resulted in highly significant (P < 0.01), and CD8a or CD4 single depletion resulted in
signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) reductions of tumor suppression (Fig. 6A).
These results indicate that both CD8þ and CD4þ T cells
contribute to the optimal antitumor effect of HER2/Neu
antibody and triciribine combination treatment. Notably,
depletion of CD8þ or CD4þ T cells or both during combination
treatment still inhibited tumors better than Ctrl, Ab, or triciribine single agent treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
Given that IFN-g level is markedly increased in tumors after
combination treatment with antibody and triciribine in our
models (Fig. 5A–C), we next investigated whether CD8þ or
CD4þ T cells or both contribute to the increased IFN-g levels.
We found that depleting CD8þ or/and CD4þ T cells signiﬁcantly reduced IFN-g production, indicating both CD8þ and
CD4þ T cells contribute to IFN-g production (Fig. 6B). We next
asked whether IFN-g is a mediator of CD8þ and CD4þ T cells'
antitumor effect of combination treatment. Blocking IFN-g
function with neutralizing mAb (R4-6A2) signiﬁcantly reduced
the antitumor efﬁcacy of combination treatment (P < 0.05; Fig.
6C). These results indicate that IFN-g from CD8þ and CD4þ T
cells contributes to the therapeutic activity of combination
treatment.
Enhancing T-cell response by blocking CTLA-4 further
improves the antitumor activity of HER2/Neu antibody
and triciribine combination treatment
Because increased inﬁltration of CD8þ and CD4þ T cells in
the tumor microenvironment contributed to the optimal
antitumor effect of combination treatment (Fig. 6), we wondered whether enhancing the activity of these T cells may
further augment the antitumor effect. Given that costimulatory
or coinhibitory signals provided by coreceptors of T-cell
receptors are critical for T-cell activity (34), we examined the
expression of 3 major coreceptors including costimulator
CD28, inducible costimulator (ICOS), and inhibitory coreceptor cytotoxic CTLA-4 (or CD152). We found that along with
increased expression of CD28 and ICOS, CTLA-4 expression
was also increased markedly in tumors with combination
treatment of both PTEN//NIC and PTEN//ErbB2KI models (Fig. 7A and B). The highly signiﬁcant and consistent
increase of CTLA-4 expression suggests that the CTLA-4
inhibitory coreceptor may play an important role in the
negative feedback regulation of T-cell response upon T-cell
activation by combination treatment, and blockade of this
negative signal during combination treatment might potentially improve the antitumor effect (35, 36). Remarkably, as
shown in Fig. 7C, HER2/Neu antibody and triciribine combination with the addition of CTLA-4 blocking mAb signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.05) better inhibited tumors than without the anti-CTLA4 mAb in PTEN//NIC mice. Anti-CTLA-4 mAb alone, antiCTLA-4 mAb combined with HER2/Neu antibody only, or with
triciribine only showed no signiﬁcant enhancement of antitumor effect (Supplementary Fig. S7). Although the number of
inﬁltrating T cells (including CD8þ and CD4þ T cells) was not
signiﬁcantly increased in the HER2/Neu antibody and

with tumor inhibition activity (Fig. 7). These results indicate
that serum IFN-g level is a potential biomarker for predicting

Discussion
Trastuzumab resistance is a clinically devastating problem
for HER2-positive breast cancers. In the present study, we used
2 distinct GEM models with HER2/Neu overexpression and
PTEN loss as preclinical models closely mimicking trastuzumab-resistant human breast cancer with the aim of facilitating
development of better strategies to overcome trastuzumab
resistance in the clinic. Our results show that HER2/Neu

antibody and the Akt inhibitor triciribine combination treatment not only suppressed Erk and Akt activities in tumor cells
but also triggered T-cell response in the tumor microenvironment, which contributed to optimal antitumor effect. Therefore, both autonomous (inhibition of oncogenic signaling of

tumor cells) and nonautonomous (immune response in tumor
microenvironment) mechanisms were involved in the therapeutic activity of combination treatment. Importantly, modulation of immune response was shown to be essential in
overcoming trastuzumab resistance.

Emerging evidence suggests that necrotic death of cancer
cells triggered by certain chemotherapeutic drugs can
induce tumor-speciﬁc adaptive immune responses, which
are essential to the antitumor activity (19, 37–40). On the
other hand, therapeutic mAbs are effective in enhancing the
presentation of apoptotic tumor cells or soluble tumor
antigens to T cells by dendritic cells (29, 41). We observed
large areas of necrosis, more apoptotic cells, and signiﬁcant
inﬁltration of CD3þ T cells in combination-treated tumors
but not in control, antibody, or triciribine single–treated
tumors (Fig. 3A). Because HER2/Neu antibody and triciribine combination treatment enhanced T-cell response (Fig.
5), possibly through presentation of apoptotic cells and
tumor debris by antigen-presenting cells (APC), we postulate
that tumor cell death induced by combination treatment is
necessary and as an initiator, then feedback positively, to
induce T-cell responses via APCs in the combination treatment group.
CD8þ cytotoxic T lymphocytes are a major component of
adaptive immunity that attacks tumor cells (29). Several studies have reported that tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ lymphocytes or
stromal expression of CD8a are signiﬁcantly associated with
better clinical outcomes of breast cancer (42–44). Tumorassociated T lymphocytes are also an independent predictor
of response to anthracycline/taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer (20). Recently, CD8þ T-cell–
dependent adaptive immune response has been shown to be
required for maximal therapeutic effects of anti-HER2/Neu
antibody (7). In our study, we observed marked increase of
CD8þ T-cell inﬁltration upon combination treatment compared with anti-HER2/Neu antibody alone and depletion of
CD8þ T cells decreased the tumor inhibition effect by combination treatment. The data support a more important role of
CD8þ T-cell–dependent adaptive immune response in antitumor effect of combination treatment. Interestingly, depletion
of CD4þ T cells also diminished the antitumor potency of
combination treatment, suggesting that CD4þ T cells are also
required for antitumor effect of combination treatment. CD4þ
T-cell response has been previously observed in patients with
breast cancer treated with trastuzumab (45). Notably, increasing evidence indicates that CD4þ cells can play critical roles in
antitumor immunity (46–52). CD4þ T cells were considered to
play a critical role in maintaining/facilitating CD8þ T cells'
cytotoxic function by providing the appropriate cytokine
milieu (29). Recent studies showed that CD4þ T cells are able
to eradicate tumor directly (51); and may be even more efﬁcient
than CD8þ cells at tumor rejection (50). Consistently, our
combination treatment induced a dominant antitumor Th1
polarization in the tumor microenvironment characterized by
increased expression of IFN-g, IL-2, and IL-12, thus favoring
tumor regression by CTLs-mediated killing of cancer cells (Fig.
4 and 5). Depletion of either CD8þ or CD4þ T cells decreased
antitumor effect in our model (Fig. 6), indicating that the
cooperation of CD8þ and CD4þ T cells is required for the
antitumor effect of combination treatment. Our data, along
with others' ﬁndings, show that optimal tumoricidal activity of
anticancer therapies is typically achieved with both CD8þ and
CD4þ T-cell responses (49). Therefore, our novel ﬁndings

4426

Cancer Res; 72(17) September 1, 2012

showed that immune response is functionally essential in
overcoming trastuzumab resistance.
Because anti-CD4 mAb depletes both Th and Treg CD4þ
cells, we were unable to dissect the role of CD4þ Treg cells
separately in this study. Nevertheless, the overall immunosuppressive effect of CD4þ Treg cells during combination treatment is likely very limited because depletion of CD4þ T cells
resulted in decreased rather than increased antitumor activity
of combination treatment (Fig. 6A). Further experiments with
speciﬁc depletion of Th cells or Treg cells would reveal
deﬁnitive role of CD4þ T cells in our model.
Although combination therapy with HER2/Neu antibody
and triciribine induced an initial immune response against
HER2/Neu overexpression–PTEN loss tumors, the therapeutic
effect was still incomplete, partly due to the development of
immunosuppressive mechanisms. CTLA-4 is inducibly
expressed in activated CD4þ and CD8þ effector T cells, which
provides negative feedback signal to suppress T-cell activity.
Combination treatment increased the numbers of both CD8þ
and CD4þ T cells required for the optimal antitumor effect. At
the same time, negative feedback was augmented through
CTLA-4 by combination treatment to suppress T-cell activity
and inhibit antitumor effect. The seemingly opposing effects of
combination treatment on T-cell activity provide us a unique
opportunity to further boost the antitumor response of combination treatment by blocking CTLA-4 to favor T-cell
response and tumor elimination. Indeed, blockade of CTLA4 further improved the therapeutic activity of HER2/Neu
antibody and triciribine combination in our model (Fig. 7). In
addition, CTLA-4 is constitutively expressed on a subset of
Tregs. In support of this notion, concomitant blockade of
CTLA-4 on both effector T cells and Tregs was previously
shown to contribute to the maximal therapeutic effects of antiCTLA-4 mAb treatment (53). It is clear that augmentation of
immune response by inhibiting immunosuppressing molecules could further improve the efﬁcacy of tumor cell–based
targeted therapies, which may be a particularly effective anticancer strategy.
The ﬁndings in the current study can potentially be
translated to the clinic for patients' beneﬁt. First, trastuzumab is part of the standard treatment for HER2-positive
breast cancers. Second, triciribine is a tricyclic nucleoside
inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 (54), and
Phase I and II clinical trials showed that triciribine's safety
and side effects were dose dependent (55–57). Although
treatment with triciribine alone was not efﬁcacious against
advanced breast, colon, and lung cancer even at very high
doses (55, 56), recent preclinical studies showed that triciribine combined with other anticancer agents was therapeutically effective against T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(58), breast cancer (16, 59), and prostate cancer (60). In
addition, other clinically applicable PI3K/Akt inhibitors may
be used as alternatives of triciribine in combination treatment. Third, 2 CTLA-4 blocking antibodies, ipilimumab
(Bristol-Myers Squibb) and tremelimumab (Pﬁzer) are currently under intense clinical investigation. CTLA-4 blockade
has shown promise in the treatment of metastatic melanoma (61), and ipilimumab has been approved for ﬁrst- and
