Abstract

Author Manuscript

The majority of patients with lung cancer present with metastatic disease. Chronic inflammation
and subsequent activation of NF-κB have been associated the development of cancers. The
RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB is typically associated with transcriptional activation. In this report
we show that RelA/p65 can function as an active transcriptional repressor through enhanced
methylation of the BRMS1 metastasis suppressor gene promoter via direct recruitment of DNMT-1
to chromatin in response to TNF. TNF-mediated phosphorylation of S276 on RelA/p65 is required
for RelA/p65-DNMT-1 interactions, chromatin loading of DNMT-1, and subsequent BRMS1
promoter methylation and transcriptional repression. The ability of RelA/65 to function as an
active transcriptional repressor is promoter specific as the NF-κB-regulated gene cIAP2 is
transcriptionally activated while BRMS1 is repressed under identical conditions. Small molecule
inhibition of either of the minimal interacting domains between RelA/p65-DNMT-1 and RelA/
p65-BRMS1 promoter abrogates BRMS1 methylation and its transcriptional repression. The ability
of RelA/p65 to directly recruit DNMT-1 to chromatin resulting in promoter-specific methylation
and transcriptional repression of tumor metastasis suppressor gene BRMS1 highlights a new
mechanism through which NF-κB can regulate metastatic disease, and offers a potential target for
newer generation epigenetic oncopharmaceuticals.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is aberrantly activated in malignancies and its activation is
essential for tumor proliferation and metastatic process (Baldwin, 1996; BobrovnikovaMarjon et al., 2004; Bours et al., 1994; Denlinger et al., 2004; Helbig et al., 2003; Huber et
al., 2004; Karin and Greten, 2005; Takada et al., 2005). Typically NF-κB is a transcriptional
activator after stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Chen et al., 1998; Mayo and Baldwin, 2000). In
unstimulated cell nuclei RelA/p65 and/or p50 are transcriptionally repressed through
interactions on chromatin with histone deacetylases (HDAC) -1 and -3 co-repressor
complexes. Following stimulation, derepression of RelA/p65 occurs through
phosphorylation on serines 276 (Dong et al., 2008; Zhong et al., 2002) or 536 (Hoberg et
al., 2006) which enhances its association with histone acetyltransferases (HATs) allowing
RelA/p65 to activate transcription (Chen et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2005).
In 2004, Campbell first described the ability of RelA/65 to function as an “active repressor”
under specific cytotoxic stimuli (Campbell et al., 2004). Interestingly, TNF and IL-6, both
classical stimuli for NF-κB activation, also have been correlated with enhanced methylation
of promoter-CGI resulting in transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes (Hodge et
al., 2005; Ushijima and Okochi-Takada, 2005; Wehbe et al., 2006). These observations
suggest that under specific conditions NF-κB activation may be related to methylation of
specific genes, although the mechanisms through which this occurs are unknown.

Author Manuscript

BRMS1 was originally identified as a tumor metastasis suppressor and its expression levels
have been shown to be markedly reduced in various cancers (Liu et al., 2006b; Meehan and
Welch, 2003); with the loss of the BRMS1 allele coinciding with increased numbers of
metastases and decreased survival in breast cancer and lung cancer patients (Hicks et al.,
2006; Smith et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2006). We have shown that methylation of the
specific CGI (−531 to +608) contributes to BRMS1 transcriptional repression in NSCLC
cells and human tumors (Nagji et al., 2010).
In this report we provide evidence that RelA/p65 functions as an active transcriptional
repressor through enhanced methylation of the BRMS1 promoter via direct recruitment of
DNMT-1 to chromatin in response to TNF. Our study offers new insight into an alternative
mechanism through which NF-κB can function as an active transcriptional repressor to
promote tumor metastasis.

TNF represses BRMS1 transcription via BRMS1 promoter methylation
Chronic inflammation and the pro-inflammatory cytokines are increasingly appreciated as
contributing significantly to cancer progression (Coussens and Werb, 2002; Greten and
Karin, 2004; Karin and Greten, 2005; Pikarsky et al., 2004). In our model system the proinflammatory cytokine TNF significantly increased the invasive potential of NSCLC H157
and H1299 cells (Fig. 1A). Similarly, siRNA knockdown of endogenous BRMS1 resulted in
a dramatic increase in the invasive potential of NSCLC cells (Fig. S1).

Since we have shown that BRMS1 is downregulated in NSCLC (Liu et al., 2006b) we next
sought to determine whether TNF promotes lung cancer cell invasion through regulation of
BRMS1 expression. We observed that TNF reduced both protein (Fig. 1B) and transcription
(Fig. 1C) levels of BRMS1 in a time-dependent manner in NSCLC H157 and H1299 cells,
and normal bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, respectively. These data suggest that
repression of BRMS1 transcription is a plausible mechanism through which inflammatory
cytokines promotes the metastatic potential of NSCLC.
Given that methylation of the CGI results in BRMS1 transcriptional repression (Nagji et al.,
2010), we hypothesized that TNF may be decreasing BRMS1 transcription through enhanced
BRMS1 promoter methylation. As we expected, TNF increased BRMS1 methylation in a
time -and dose - dependent manner in NHBE cells (Fig. 1D and Fig. S2A). These results
establish that TNF enhances BRMS1 transcriptional repression through DNA methylation.

RelA/p65 mediates TNF- induced methylation and transcriptional repression of BRMS1

Author Manuscript

The biological functions of TNF are realized primarily by activating NF-κB, particularly its
active subunit RelA/p65 (Greten et al., 2004). To examine the requirement of endogenous
RelA/p65 for enhancing BRMS1 promoter methylation following TNF treatment, p65WT and
p65−/− MEF cells were exposed to the demethylating reagent 5-Aza for global
hypomethylation of the entire genome. Following removal of 5-Aza, the BRMS1 promoter
was re-methylated in the TNF treated p65WT cells. In contrast, in the p65−/− cells the
BRMS1 promoter remained hypomethylated despite treatment with TNF (Fig. 2A).
Subsequent quantitative RT-PCR studies demonstrated that methylation events observed
Fig. 2A correlated with decreased BRMS1 transcription levels in the TNF treated p65 WT
MEF cells (Fig. 2B). TNF-mediated repression of BRMS1 transcription results in an
approximately 6-fold increase in BRMS1 promoter methylation over basal levels.
Importantly, we found that under normal condition the basal expression of RelA/p65 has
little impact on the methylation status or transcription of BRMS1 (Figs. 2A and B). This
strongly suggests that this process is an inducible event and RelA/p65 is actively involved in
TNF-mediated BRMS1 transcriptional repression.
To investigate the effects of RelA/p65 on BRMS1 promoter methylation in NSCLC, we
exploited previously generated H157 NSCLC cells which stably express SR-IκB, a
dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-κB, (H157I) or a vector control (H157V) (Jones et al.,
2000). As shown in Fig. 2C, cells lacking the ability to activate NF-κB (H157I) have a 4fold decrease in basal BRMS1 promoter methylation levels compared to controls (H157V).

Author Manuscript

In addition, even with removal of 5-Aza the BRMS1 promoter in the H157I cells cannot be
methylated, while H157V cells return to near basal levels at 48 hours. In addition, we also
assessed methylation levels of endogenous BRMS1 promoter in H157V and I cells using
bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP). As shown in Fig. S2B, BSP measurements of basal BRMS1
promoter methylation is roughly 3-4-fold in the H157V cells compared to H157I cells which
correlates exactly with our MSP results.

Collectively these studies confirm that RelA/p65 is required for TNF-mediated methylation
and transcriptional repression of BRMS1 and provide the first evidence of the potential role
of RelA/p65 as an epigenetic regulator of DNA methylation.
RelA/p65 directly binds DNA in the CpG island region of the BRMS1 promoter

Author Manuscript

NF-κB regulates promoter-specific transcription through binding to active -κB binding
site(s). (Chen et al., 1998). Analysis of the BRMS1 promoter reveals three putative NF-κB
binding sites (arbitrarily named I, II, and III) which are located in the CpG island (Fig. 3A).
To determine whether NF-κB can bind these putative -κB binding sites, we performed
electrophorectic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using wild-type and mutant -κB binding site
as probes. All three putative wild-type -κB binding sites bound NF-κB using the nuclear
extracts of NSCLC H157 cells (Fig. 3B) and NHBE cells (Fig. S3A). Subsequent treatment
using an anti-RelA/p65 antibody which recognizes the N-terminal region of RelA/p65
confirmed RelA/p65 specificity. Mutation of the last two conserved cytosine (C) to adenine
(A) residues in each -κB binding site completely inhibited NF-κB binding to DNA (Fig. 3B
and S3A). Moreover, EMSAs indicated that TNF increases nuclear RelA/p65 and enhances
NF-κB binding to the -κB binding sites I and II in the BRMS1 promoter, but not III (Fig. 3C
and S3B). In summary, like classical TNF-induced NF-κB activated genes, TNF mediates
BRMS1 transcriptional repression through enhanced nuclear translocation and DNA binding
of RelA/p65.

Author Manuscript

To establish which -κB binding site(s) were functional relative to RelA/p65-induced BRMS1
transcriptional repression, we created either individual or combined mutations in the -κB
binding sites in the BRMS1 reporter gene. We used site-directed mutagenesis to maintain the
conformation of the BRMS1 promoter. These assays demonstrate that RelA/p65 failed to
repress the transcriptional activity of the BRMS1 promoter that has the -κB binding site II
mutation, while mutation of the other two -κB binding sites individually or in combination
(data not shown), had no effect on RelA/p65, TNF, or combined TNF/RelA/p65-induced
repression (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that while all three -κB binding
sites in the BRMS1 promoter can bind NF-κB, site II appears to have more functional
significance with respect to TNF and/or RelA/p65-mediated repression of BRMS1
transcription.
RelA/p65 is required for assembly of selective DNMTs on the BRMS1 promoter

Author Manuscript

Given the requirement of DNMT-1 in the methylation process (Bestor, 2000; Okano et al.,
1999), we next examined whether RelA/p65 endogenously forms complexes with DNMT-1.
As shown in Fig. 4A, RelA/p65 has minimal interaction with DNMT-1 in the absence of
TNF. However, there is a robust increase in the endogenous interaction of RelA/p65 and
DNMT-1 following TNF treatment. Furthermore, we found that the combination of
DNMT-1 and -3b resulted in the most robust repression of BRMS1 transcriptional activity
following ectopic expression of RelA/p65 (Fig. S4A).
To examine the requirement for RelA/p65 in loading of key methylation components on
chromatin, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that removal of 5-Aza
resulted in recruitment of DNMT-1 (Fig. 4B) and -3b (Fig. S4B) to the BRMS1 promoter in

H157V, but not in the H157I cells in a time-dependent manner. The presence or absence of
RelA/p65 had no effect on loading of DNMT-3a (Fig. S4B). Review of the data in Figs. 4B
and S4C suggests that the re-recruitment of DNMT-3b on chromatin occurs earlier (~24
hrs), compared to DNMT-1 (~36–48 hrs). Not surprisingly, methylated histone H3-K9
chromatin occupancy was increased on the BRMS1 promoter in the presence of RelA/p65
only. Subsequent Western blot analyses confirmed that the observed decreases of chromatinassociated DNMT-1 and -3b in the H157I cells were not secondary to regulation by
RelA/p65 (Figs. 4B and S4B).

Author Manuscript

Given that heterodimer RelA/p65/p50 is the most common form of NF-κB, siRNA knock
down of p50 resulted in significant loss of chromatin-associated RelA/p65, DNMT-1 and
methylation on the BRMS1 promoter (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, reducing p50 expression did
not affect RelA/p65 loading to the promoter of a known NF-κB-regulated gene, cIAP2 (Liu
et al., 2006a). This data suggested that RelA/p65 mediates methylation and transcriptional
repression of BRMS1 through heterodimerization with p50.
To determine if TNF-induced chromatin loading of DNMTs is promoter specific we
examined the promoter regions of BRMS1, cIAP2, as well as GAPDH. While chromatin
occupancy of RelA/p65 increased with TNF concentration (Fig. 4D) and time (Fig. S4C)
across both the BRMS1 and cIAP2 promoters, no DNMTs were recruited to the cIAP2
promoter, presumably secondary to an absence of a CpG island in the cIAP2 promoter (Fig.
4D and S4C).

Author Manuscript

Realizing that DNMTs may be recruited to DNA by factors other than RelA/p65, we
performed a re-ChIP assay using RelA/p65 as the first IP antibody. There is a TNF
concentration-dependent increase in DNMT-1 recruitment to the BRMS1 promoter, but not
on the cIAP2 promoter (Fig. 4D). This analysis strongly suggests that DNMT-1 is part of the
methylation complex recruited by RelA/p65 to chromatin. Importantly, this process appears
to be gene specific and is likely dependent on the chromatin landscape of each promoter.

Author Manuscript

To ensure that our cell culture observations were relevant to human lung cancer we
performed ChIP analyses in patient specimens using the most common lung cancer
histologies -adenocarcinoma (Adeno) and squamous cell (Squam). Identical DNMT-1 and
RelA/p65 assembly patterns were uniquely observed across the BRMS1 promoter, but not
the cIAP2 or GAPDH promoters (Fig. 4E). Important differences in BRMS1 promoter
occupancy are also demonstrated between adjacent non-cancerous tissue (N) and the tumor
(T). Collectively, we have demonstrated that RelA/p65 is required for DNMT-1 and -3b
binding to BRMS1 chromatin, which is responsible for the subsequent methylation and
transcriptional repression of the BRMS1 promoter.
Inhibition of RelA/p65 DNA binding reduces chromatin-associated DNMT-1 and reactivates BRMS1 expression
Crystallography has suggested that the region responsible for RelA/p65 binding to 3’ subsite
of -κB binding sites occurs through Arg 33, Arg35, Tyr 36, Glu 39 and Arg 187 (Chen et al.,
1998). To better characterize the minimal interacting domain of RelA/p65 that binds to the
BRMS1 promoter, we exploited the use of protein transduction domain (PTD) peptide which

have been shown to be an effective way of delivering proteins in vitro and in vivo (Schwarze
and Dowdy, 2000). We synthesized and expressed three short RelA/p65 peptides including
amino acids 31–40, 38–47, and 45–54, linked to an antennapedia- PTD derived from the
Drosophila homeotic transcription factor ANTP (Fig.5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, the PTDRelA/p65 (38–47) peptide blocked RelA/p65 DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner.

Author Manuscript

In order to detect if these short PTD-RelA/p65 peptides could directly bind DNA, in vitro
EMSAs were performed. As shown in Fig. S5A, only PTD-RelA/p65 (38–47) directly binds
to -κB binding site II. To confirm the specificity of our PTD-RelA/p65 (38–47) peptide we
mutated Glu 39 to Ala (E39A); the result is a complete abolishment of DNA binding of the
PTD-RelA/p65 (38–47) peptide (Fig. S5A). Data presented in Figs. 5C and S5B highlight
the dose-dependent effects of the PTD-RelA/p65 (38–47) on endogenous BRMS1 mRNA,
methylation, and protein levels compared to PTD controls. In stark contrast, examination of
the known NF-κB-regulated genes, cIAP2 , Bfl/A1 (Liu et al., 2006a) and IκBα demonstrate
a robust decrease in these transcripts following PTD/p65(38–47) exposure (Fig. S5C). In
aggregate, these data indicate that the PTD-RelA/p65 (38–47) peptide directly binds DNA
and functions as a blocking peptide to compete with RelA/p65 binding. Moreover, as shown
by others (Chen et al., 1998), E39 is a critical amino acid for RelA/p65 DNA binding.
Importantly, the above experiments provide solid evidence that RelA/p65 binds to chromatin
to transcriptionally activate some genes (cIAP2, Bfl/1A, IκBα), while in others (BRMS1)
RelA/p65 clearly functions as an active transcriptional repressor.

Author Manuscript

To confirm that RelA/p65 (38–47) was the interacting domain required for RelA/p65
loading to chromatin, ChIP assays were performed. Following removal of 5-Aza, the panhypomethylated H157 lung cancer cells were pretreated with PTD-RelA/p65 (38–47) or
PTD alone followed by stimulation with TNF (Figs. 5D and S5D). GST-PTD-RelA/p65
(38–47), but not GST-PTD, was found on the BRMS1 promoter suggesting that it
endogenously binds to the BRMS1 promoter and functions as a competitive inhibitor for -κB
binding sites on chromatin. In the presence of PTD-RelA/p65 (38–47), the recruitment of
RelA/p65, methyl-histone H3-K9, and DNMTs were all dramatically decreased on the
BRMS1 promoter.
These studies confirm that amino acids 38–47 are necessary for RelA/p65-mediated
methylation and active repression of BRMS1. In addition, of the 5 important amino acids,
only Glu 39 is located in this region with mutation of Glu 39 completely abolishing the
PTD-RelA/p65 (38–47) peptide DNA binding (Fig. 5 and S5).
The RelA/p65 109–120 region is required for DNMT-1 binding

Author Manuscript

Next, we were interested in whether RelA/p65 binding to DNMT-1 was required for
regulating promoter methylation, transcription of BRMS1. To experimentally address this,
GST pull-down experiments indicated that the N-terminus region (1–245 aa) of RelA/p65 is
responsible for the interaction with DNMT-1 (Fig. 6A). Using a series of N-terminal
deletion constructs we found that the first 108 residues in RelA/p65 do not affect RelA/p65DNMT-1 interactions. However, expanding the deletion inclusive of 119 residues, RelA/p65
failed to bind DNMT-1 (Fig. 6B). We thus hypothesized that the RelA/p65 109–120 aa

region was a strong candidate for the minimal interacting domain for RelA/p65 and
DNMT-1.
To ascertain whether inhibition of the endogenous interaction between RelA/p65-DNMT-1
had functional relevance, we synthesized and expressed a short PTD-linked RelA/p65 (109–
120 aa) peptide. Following PTD-RelA/p65 (109–120) peptide treatment, the endogenous
interaction of RelA/p65-DNMT-1 was significantly decreased in HEK 293T, NSCLC cells
(Fig. 6C). Interestingly, both BRMS1 mRNA and protein levels were increased after treated
with the PTD-RelA/p65 (109–120) peptide (Fig. 6D and data not shown). To prove the
specificity of RelA/p65 (109–120) peptide, a mutant of PTD-RelA/p65 (109–120) peptide
failed to affect the interaction of RelA/p65-DNMT-1 and BRMS1 mRNA (Fig. S6A and B).
This strongly suggests that DNMT-1 is involved in BRMS1 transcriptional regulation
through interactions with RelA/p65.

Author Manuscript

To investigate if the PTD-RelA/p65 (109–120) peptide blocks the interaction of RelA/p65DNMT-1 on chromatin resulting in decreased BRMS1 methylation, ChIP and re-ChIP assays
were performed cross the BRMS1 and cIAP2 promoters. Inhibition of RelA/p65 and
DNMT-1 interaction dramatically reduces the recruitment of DNMT-1 to the BRMS1
promoter, without any effect on RelA/p65 promoter loading. In addition, using 5-methylcytidine as well established mark of promoter methylation (Suzuki and Bird, 2008) there is
significant inhibition of basal BRMS1 promoter methylation. These results prove that
RelA/p65 tethers DNMT-1 on chromatin to promote methylation and transcriptional
repression of BRMS1 and that inhibition of RelA/p65-DNMT-1 binding results in an
increase in BRMS1 mRNA in NSCLC cells.

Author Manuscript

In addition, blocking RelA/p65-DNMT-1 binding using the PTD-RelA/p65 (109–120)
peptide dramatically inhibited basal and TNF stimulated invasion potential of lung cancer
cells compared to the treatment with PTD only (Fig. 6F). This data confirms the biological
function of RelA/p65-DNMT-1 binding in NSCLC cells.
Phosphorylation of serine 276 is required for RelA/p65-DNMT-1 interactions on the BMRS1
promoter

Author Manuscript

Recently, the Ghosh laboratory has demonstrated the importance of phosphorylation of
serine 276 as a primary event that governs whether RelA/p65 functions as a transcriptional
activator or as a basal transcriptional repressor (Dong et al., 2008; Zhong et al., 2002). In
our model system, we observed that S276A mutation in RelA/p65 resulted in a dramatic
rescue of basal- and TNF-induced BRMS1 transcriptional repression. Neither K310R nor
S536A mutants affected RelA/p65-mediated BRMS1 transcriptional repression (Fig. 7A).
These findings suggest that TNF-induced phosphorylation of S276 is important to RelA/
p65-mediated BRMS1 transcriptional repression. Importantly the S276A mutant of RelA/p65
fails to bind DNMT-1 (Fig. 7B).
Finally, to investigate if phosphorylation of S276 is required for RelA/p65 and subsequent
DNMT-1 loading to chromatin ChIP and re-ChIP assays were performed as described above
(Fig. 7C). The RelA/p65 S276A mutant had no effect on the recruitment of RelA/p65 to
BRMS1 and cIAP2 promoters compared to wild-type RelA/p65. Interestingly, the RelA/p65

S276A mutant dramatically inhibited DNA methylation (5-methyl-cytidine) on the BRMS1
promoter, compared with wild-type RelA/p65. Furthermore, re-ChIP assays indicated that
the RelA/p65 S276A mutant cannot assemble DNMT-1 on the BRMS1 promoter. This
strongly suggests that phosphorylation of serine 276 is required for DNMT-1 binding to
RelA/p65 with subsequent loading of DNMT-1 to chromatin.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In this report we show that TNF-induction of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB is required for
promoter methylation of BRMS1, a gene we have previously shown to be important in the
metastatic movement of lung cancer cells (Smith et al., 2009). RelA/p65 recruits DNMT1 to
chromatin resulting in BRMS1 methylation. Moreover, we show that a specific posttranslational event, S276 phosphorylation, is required for RelA/p65 binding to DNMT1, the
resulting recruitment of DNMT-1 to chromatin, specific CGI methylation, and
transcriptional repression (Fig.8). These observations are supported by other studies
demonstrating that transcription factors can induce DNA methylation through recruitment of
DNMTs to the promoter, such as Stat-3 (Zhang et al., 2005), PML-RAR (Di Croce et al.,
2002) and RelB (Puto and Reed, 2008).
RelA/p65 activation is typically associated with promoting transcription (Baldwin, 1996;
Wang et al., 1996). However, depending on the stimuli, the specific gene, and the unique
chromatin landscape of that gene, transcription factors can have dual functions in
transcriptional regulation. Examples of such dual-functioning transcription factors include
p53, Sp1, ERα, NF-Y, and Stat3 (Ceribelli et al., 2008; Hoffman et al., 2002; Mottet et al.,
2009; Romano et al.; Sankpal et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2005).

Author Manuscript

NF-κB was first identified as an active transcriptional repressor by the Perkin’s laboratory
under cytotoxic stimuli such as UV-C and doxorubicin (Campbell et al., 2004). Following
TNF treatment, RelA/p65 also has been reported to actively represses transcription of α 2(I)
Collagen (Kouba et al., 1999), hypoxia-inducible death factor BNIP3 (Shaw et al., 2006),
and tumor suppressor PTEN (Kim et al., 2004; Xia et al., 2007) via directly binding the
putative-κB binding sites on chromatin.

Author Manuscript

Although reported mechanisms through which NF-κB transcriptional inactivation have
largely been relegated to the ability of RelA/p65 to associate with HDACs in unstimulated
cells (Dong et al., 2008; Zhong et al., 2002), it remains unclear how RelA/p65 functions as a
transcriptional repressor in the presence of stimulation, such as TNF. Our studies identify a
novel mechanism through which TNF induces RelA/p65 to function as an active repressor.
This mechanism involves an inducible RelA/p65/p50-mediated recruitment of DNMTs to
chromatin which results in promoter methylation and transcriptional repression. Importantly,
in our model system the ability of RelA/p65 to bind DNMT-1 is independent of HDACs
activities (Fig. S7).
TNF activates RelA/p65 through inducing phosphorylation of S276 by protein kinase A
(PKA) (Zhong et al., 1997), or mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK1),
(Vermeulen et al., 2003). While previous reports suggest that RelA/p65 S276

phosphorylation results in preferential interaction with co-activator complexes for selected
genes (Dong et al., 2008; Zhong et al., 2002), we found that the S276 phosphorylation is
required for RelA/p65 interacting with DNMT-1, DNMT-1 recruitment to the specificpromoter, and transcriptional repression. We postulate that phosphorylation of S276 may
result in a conformational changes of RelA/p65 that unmasks CBP/p300 and DNMT-1
interacting domains. Whether CBP/p300 or DNMT-1 binds RelA/p65 is dependent on the
gene-specific chromatin environment. In support of this theory we observed that TNF
temporally promotes RelA/p65 binding to the promoters of both the metastasis suppressor
gene BRMS1 and the classic NF-κB-regulated gene cIAP2. However, in contrast to BRMS1,
there is no CGI in the cIAP2 promoter and thus, there is no chromatin loading of DNMTs.
The result is a completely opposite effect on RelA/p65-mediated gene transcription: BRMS1
is transcriptionally repressed and cIAP2 is transcriptionally activated. It is probably because
S276 phosphorylation results in differential RelA/p65 affinities to interact with co-activators
or co-repressors depending on the underlying chromatin landscape (Chen et al., 2000b).
Evidence of differential transcriptional activities following RelA/p65 phosphorylation has
been noted by several groups. For instance, MSK1-mediated RelA/p65 S276
phosphorylation transcriptionally activates IL-6, but not another NF-κB-regulated gene
NFκB2 (Vermeulen et al., 2003). RelA/p65 S276 phosphorylation by PKA increases the
transcription of NF-κB-regulated gene IL-4, but suppresses IL-2 (Neumann et al., 1995).

An additional consideration as to whether RelA/p65 functions as a transcriptional activator
or repressor is the location of the -κB-binding site relative to the CGI. As an example, there
is differential regulation of GATA4 and SHP1, two Stat3 regulated genes both with a CGI in
their proximal promoters, but with different locations of Stat3 binding regions (Snyder et al.,
2010; Zhang et al., 2005). We have previously demonstrated the functional significance of
specific -κB binding sites located within the promoter-CGI region of BRMS1 (Nagji et al.,
2010) confirming this additional layer of chromatin control over this process.

Author Manuscript

It is well established that RelA/p65 directly activates transcription of classic NF-κB
regulated genes (Chen et al., 2000a; Wang et al., 1998). Our previous study indicated that
BRMS1 functions as a corepressor to inhibit RelA/p65 transactivation potential by
deacetylation of K310. In addition, siRNA knockdown of BRMS1 significantly promotes
both basal and TNF-induced RelA/p65 mediated transcription (Liu et al., 2006b). In this
study we demonstrate a previously undescribed mechanism through which RelA/p65 and
BRMS1 mutually negatively co-regulate one another’s function in lung cancer cells.
Following TNF exposure, RelA/p65 actively represses BRMS1 transcription through
DNMT-1 mediated promoter methylation. Subsequently this loss of BRMS1 results in
derepression of RelA/p65 (via loss of the co-repressor function of BRMS1) (Liu et al.,
2006b), thus promoting the transactivation of RelA/p65 (Fig. 8).
In summary, we show that the TNF-induced phosphorylation of S276 of RelA/p65 results in
recruitment of DNMT-1 to the BRMS1 promoter. This results in DNA methylation and
active transcriptional repression of the metastasis suppressor BRMS1. It is likely that the
ability of RelA/p65 to function as a transcriptional repressor is not unique to the BRMS1
promoter, but promoters with similar chromatin landscapes may also be regulated in a
similar manner, making our observations broadly applicable. Our studies suggest that in

addition to the known post-translational modifications of RelA/p65 that govern its function,
promoter specifics such as CGI presence or absence, CGI location, and the location of
RelA/p65 binding regions on chromatin are also important determinants of whether
RelA/p65 functions as an inducible transcriptional activator or repressor. Our data do
suggest a novel mechanism through which NF-κB promotes cancer progression and may
allow for the design and development of specific oncopharmacologic compounds that can
selectively de-repress important anti-metastatic genes negatively regulated by RelA/p65
through targeting its DNA binding and/or DNMT-1 binding.

efficiency was proved by Western blot. (D) ChIP and re-ChIP analyses were performed in
HEK 293T cells treated with TNF at the indicated doses for 16 hrs across the BRMS1
promoter, and the promoters of cIAP2 and GAPDH. Re-ChIP analysis used anti-RelA/p65 as
the first immunoprecipitating antibody. (E) ChIP analyses were performed using patients’
samples (Adeno: adenocarcinoma, Squam: squamous cell cancer, T: lung tumor, N: matched
adjacent non-cancerous lung tissue,) cross the BRMS1 promoter, as well as the promoters of

(A) Mutation of RelA/p65 S276 failed to inhibit BRMS1 promoter activity. p65−/−MEFs
were transiently co-transfected with BRMS1-luc. reporter and expression vectors encoding
indicated Flag-tagged RelA/p65. The luciferase activity was determined as described above.
(B) RelA/p65 S276A cannot bind DNMT-1. p65−/− MEFs were transfected with expression
vector encoding indicated Flag-tagged RelA/p65. Co-IPs were performed as previously
described. (C) Mutation of S276 significantly reduced RelA/p65-mediated DNMT-1 loading
to the BRMS1 promoter. HEK 293T cells were transfected with expression vector encoding
indicated Flag-tagged RelA/p65. ChIP and re-ChIP analyses were performed across the
BRMS1 promoter, and the promoters cIAP2 and GAPDH. Re-ChIP analysis used anti-Flag
epitope as the first immunoprecipitating antibody.

Fig. 8. RelA/p65 activates transcription through the dual mechanisms

In response to TNF stimulation, RelA/p65 directly activates transcription of classic NF-κBregulated genes, such as cIAP2 and Bfl/A1. RelA/p65 can also function as an “active
repressor” to induce methylation and transcriptional repression of BRMS1, a known corepressor of RelA/p65, by assembly of DNMT-1 to chromatin. In this process,
phosphorylation of serine 276 is required for the interaction of RelA/p65 with DNMT-1.
Whether RelA/p65 functions as an inducible transcriptional activator or repressor depends
on the chromatin landscape of the target genes. Moreover, the repression of BRMS1
transcription results in derepression of RelA/p65 transactivation through enhanced
acetylation of K310, which further enhances RelA/p65-mediated transcriptional activation.
