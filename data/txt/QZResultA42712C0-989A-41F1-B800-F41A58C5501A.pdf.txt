Abstract

Introduction

Hormone-driven expression of the ERG oncogene after fusion
with TMPRSS2 occurs in 30% to 70% of therapy-naive
prostate cancers. Its relevance in castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) remains controversial as ERG is not expressed
in some TMPRSS2-ERG androgen-independent xenograft
models. However, unlike these models, CRPC patients have
an increasing prostate-specific antigen, indicating active
androgen receptor signaling. Here, we collected blood every
month from 89 patients (54 chemotherapy-naive patients and
35 docetaxel-treated patients) treated in phase I/phase II
clinical trials of an orally available, highly specific CYP17
inhibitor, abiraterone acetate, that ablates the synthesis of
androgens and estrogens that drive TMPRSS2-ERG fusions.
We isolated circulating tumor cells (CTC) by anti–epithelial
cell adhesion molecule immunomagnetic selection followed
by cytokeratin and CD45 immunofluorescence and 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. We used multicolor
fluorescence in situ hybridization to show that CRPC CTCs,
metastases, and prostate tissue invariably had the same ERG
gene status as therapy-naive tumors (n = 31). We then used
quantitative reverse transcription–PCR to show that ERG
expression was maintained in CRPC. We also observed
homogeneity in ERG gene rearrangement status in CTCs
(n = 48) in contrast to significant heterogeneity of AR
copy number gain and PTEN loss, suggesting that rearrangement of ERG may be an earlier event in prostate carcinogenesis. We finally report a significant association between
ERG rearrangements in therapy-naive tumors, CRPCs,
and CTCs and magnitude of prostate-specific antigen decline
(P = 0.007) in CRPC patients treated with abiraterone acetate.
These data confirm that CTCs are malignant in origin and
indicate that hormone-regulated expression of ERG persists
in CRPC. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):2912–8]

Hormone-driven expression of the ERG oncogene after fusion
with TMPRSS2 occurs in 30% to 70% of therapy-naive prostate
cancers (1). Its relevance in castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) remains controversial, as ERG is not expressed in some
TMPRSS2-ERG androgen-independent xenograft models (2). However, unlike these models, CRPC patients have an increasing
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) indicating active androgen receptor
(AR) signaling. Recent studies indicate that the oral and highly
specific CYP17 inhibitor, abiraterone acetate, ablates the synthesis
of androgens and estrogens that drive TMPRSS2-ERG fusions
(1, 3), inducing disease regression in >50% of CRPC patients (4). We
hypothesized that hormone-dependent overexpression of ERG
persisted in CRPC and that TMPRSS2-ERG tumors represented a
subgroup of prostate cancers that remained sensitive to CYP17
blockade. We also hypothesized that two potential mechanisms of
resistance to CYP17 were gain of AR and loss of PTEN that could
result in constitutive phosphorylation of the AR, leading to
ligandless activation (5–7).
We have used anti–epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)
antibody-based immunomagnetic selection to isolate CRPC
circulating tumor cells (CTC; ref. 8) on which to perform multicolor
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) investigating the ERG, AR ,
and PTEN gene loci. As considerable differences exist in how a CTC
is defined, with several groups reporting these events differently
(9–11), we describe all anti-EpCAM and cytokeratin (CK)–positive
categories.

Materials and Methods
Patients
Blood (7.5 mL) was collected into a CellSave tube (Immunicon) from
patients with biochemically or histologically confirmed prostate cancer and
an increasing PSA despite castrate levels of testosterone (<20 ng/dL) before
starting and at monthly intervals until progression on clinical trials of
abiraterone acetate. CTCs were enumerated by the CellSearch System
(Veridex LLC; ref. 8). Archival tumor acquired before administration of
any hormone treatment and blood for CTC analysis were prospectively
collected, and patients with untreated primary tumors or accessible
metastatic disease were given the option to undergo a tumor biopsy for
research purposes. Samples were anonymized by the study trial coordinators, and operators were blinded to clinical outcome. This study was
approved by the Royal Marsden NHS Hospital Ethics Review Committees,
and informed consent was obtained for these studies.

ERG in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
(Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 13) was performed on CTCs fixed in cartridges
with 3:1 methanol/acetic acid. Briefly, CTCs were hybridized overnight at
42jC with the hybridization mix containing rhodamin-labeled PTEN probes,
Dy647-labeled 3¶-ERG, F415-labeled 5¶-ERG, and FITC-labeled AR. Cartridges were washed twice with 24% formamide/0.1 SSC at 42jC and then
filled with PBS. Cells were then individually captured with a 40 objective
in five Z-stack images over 8 Am for each filter (14). Flattened images were
scored for whether they had loss of half or all copies of PTEN (heterozygous
or homozygous loss) and increased AR copy number and, for ERG probes,
whether they were (a) class ‘‘Normal,’’ with unrearranged ERG loci
characterized by twinned Dy415 (in red; 3¶-ERG) and Dy647 (in green;
5¶-ERG) FISH signals; (b) class ‘‘Esplit,’’ with a rearranged ERG locus
manifested as separation of the red and green signals; or (c) class ‘‘Edel’’
( for ERG 5¶-deletion), an ERG rearrangement with loss of green signal
corresponding to 5¶-ERG sequences. Within classes Edel and Esplit, the
pattern could be further divided into cancers that contained one copy of the
red 3¶-ERG signal (‘‘1 Edel’’ and ‘‘1 Esplit’’) and those that exhibit more than
one copy of the 3¶-ERG FISH signal (‘‘2+ Edel’’ and ‘‘2+ Esplit’’) (12). Class
Normal tumors were classified as 3+ Normal if the presence of three or
more copies of wild-type (WT) ERG were observed (Supplementary Table
S1). For PTEN loss and ERG gene status, patients were classified into the
potentially more aggressive class, i.e., homozygous versus heterozygous loss
and 2+ Edel or 2+ Esplit versus Edel or Esplit.
FISH using an ERG break-apart assay was also performed, as described
previously (12), on tissue slices adjacent to H&E sections confirmed to
contain cancer. All the tissues were then scanned using an Ariol SL-50
scanner (Applied Imaging), and all areas of tumor were scored for ERG gene
status. Tumors were classified by ERG gene class, as used for CTCs
(Supplementary Table S1).
Expression studies. Total RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded samples using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and frozen
samples using Trizol (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s instruction and
quantified by UV spectroscopy. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) using first-strand cDNA synthesis system. Relative
mRNA levels were determined by quantitative-PCR (qPCR; 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems). ERG mRNA levels were
measured using primers spanning the exon 9/10 boundary ( forward,
5¶-GAACGAGCGCAGAGTTATCGT-3¶; reverse, 5¶-TGCCGCACATGGTCTGTACT-3¶) expressed relative to rpl32 mRNA levels ( forward, 5¶-

CCCTTGTGAAGCCCAAGA-3¶;reverse, 5¶-GACTGGTGCCGGATGAACTT-3¶)
and normalized to the ERG/rpl32 ratio of VCaP cells cultured in 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS)–containing media. Dextran-activated charcoal-stripped
FBS (CSS) or CSS plus 10 9 M R1881 for 48 h. All qPCR assays were
performed in quadruplicate.

Results
Detecting CTCs in CRPC. Blood was collected from 89 CRPC
patients being treated in phase I/II clinical trials of abiraterone
acetate; 54 patients were chemotherapy-naive and 35 had received
docetaxel. Overall, most patients had metastatic disease with only
four chemotherapy-naive patients having an increasing PSA with
no radiological evidence of disease on computed tomography scans
or bone scan (Table 1). All patients had CK+ and CK+ CD45
events with relatively few being classified with an intact nucleus
and cytoplasm (Supplementary Table S2). Of these intact CTCs,
those that are undergoing apoptosis did not provide a FISH signal
(Supplementary Table S3). A minimum of FISH results on four CTC
was required to ensure that the result was technically reproducible,
as the evaluation of FISH scores in 1,000 WBC controls revealed a
3.6% and 4.3% false-positive rate for the presence of ERG gene
rearrangements and heterozygous PTEN loss, respectively (36/1000
WBC had splitting or loss of ERG locus probe and 42/1000 WBC
had loss on one PTEN locus probe in a nucleus; Supplementary
Table S4). Four or more CTC events were identified at any time
point on the study in 51 patients, all of whom had radiologically
detectable metastatic disease. The number of CTCs declined
with treatment with abiraterone acetate (Supplementary Fig. S2;
Supplementary Table S5) and was concordant in this cohort of
patients with changes in PSA (correlation coefficient, r = 0.730;
P < 0.0001, Spearman rank test; Supplementary Fig. S3). We
confirmed, in this cohort of patients, previous observations that the
number of CTCs is associated with survival and that a decline in
the counts after treatment was associated with an improvement in
outcome (Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5; refs. 15–17).

Figure 1. Molecular characterization of CTCs. CK (green ) and CD45 (red) immunofluorescence and PTEN, ERG break-apart, and AR FISH. Examples of events
from four patients that were CK positive and had an intracellular 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole–stained nucleus are included. There are three examples of control
leukocytes that stain positive for CD45 (red) and negative for CK (no green ; A, event 46; C, events 505 and 588). A, class Edel with ERG gene copy number
heterogeneity. Patient 86 had loss of the 5¶-ERG signal suggesting fusion of TMPRSS2 with ERG secondary to deletion. All CTC analyzed were class Edel. All events
had one copy of WT ERG, but event 476 has two copies of rearranged ERG , event 736 has one copy, and event 963 has three copies. Event 476 has three
copies of AR and three of PTEN , event 736 has five copies of AR and two of PTEN , and event 936 has two copies of AR and two of PTEN . B, ERG WT ploidy. Patient 7
did not have rearrangement of ERG in any CTC. Event 135 has two copies of WT ERG and three copies of PTEN , event 267 has four copies of WT ERG and
five of PTEN , and event 416 has six copies of WT ERG and eight copies of PTEN. The number of copies of AR does not exceed the number of copies of PTEN or
WT ERG in any event shown, but seven CTC with more than five copies of AR but two of three copies of PTEN and WT ERG were observed (not shown). C,
heterogeneous PTEN loss. Patient 26 is a case of homozygous PTEN loss as shown in events 236 and 588; the CTC in event 588 is adjacent to a control leukocyte with
two copies of PTEN . There is loss of one copy of PTEN in event 13 and normal PTEN complement in event 505. ERG is not rearranged in any CTC; there
are two copies of WT ERG in events 13 and 588, five copies in event 236, and three copies in event 505. There are seven copies of AR in event 13, three copies in
event 236, one copy in event 505, and two copies in event 588; no other CTC had more than five AR copies. D, heterogeneous AR gain. Patient 71 has two or
three copies of WT ERG and PTEN in all CTCs. Event 725 has one copy of AR , event 73 has two copies of AR , event 106 has six copies of AR , and event 423 has >10
copies of AR .

FISH on CTCs reveals homogenous ERG rearrangements
but heterogenous gain of AR and loss of PTEN. FISH was
successfully performed on CTCs from 49 of 51 patients (96%) who
had four or more CTCs [20 of 54 (37%) chemotherapy-naı̈ve
patients; 29 of 35 (82%) docetaxel-treated patients]. ERG was
rearranged in CTCs from 23 of 49 patients (47%); 15 of 23 (65%)
from class Edel and 8 of 23 (34%) from class Esplit (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S6). Previous studies investigating TMPRSS2ERG in CRPC used materials collected at rapid autopsy from a
smaller number of patients and failed to detect any class Esplit
tumors (18). In all our cases, no patient had four or more CTCs
belonging to different ERG gene classes; no cases of CTCs with

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

unrearranged ERG were observed in patients with an ERG
rearrangement in biopsy tissue or CTCs. Also, in patients with an
ERG rearrangement, no cases had four or more CTCs classified
both class Edel and class Esplit. More than one copy of rearranged
ERG was observed in 10 patients (2+ Edel or 2+ Esplit, 20% of all
patients; Figs. 1A and 2A), and 13 patients (26%) had CTCs with
two or more copies of WT ERG (3+ Normal; Fig. 1B, 2B; ERG gene
classes are explained in Supplementary Table S1). In all patients
with more than two copies of the ERG gene locus, copy number
was gained heterogeneously with single patients having CTCs with
a range of different copy numbers (Fig. 2B). More than two copies
of the ERG gene locus were associated with more than two copies

of PTEN in patients with no PTEN loss. In contrast, FISH studies
revealed significant heterogeneity of PTEN loss and AR copy
number gain. Thirteen patients (26%) had evidence of loss of PTEN
in their CTCs (Table 1). Six of 13 patients had homogenous
homozygous loss of PTEN in all their CTCs. Seven patients had
heterogeneous PTEN loss: two patients each had four or more
CTCs with homozygous and heterozygous loss and four or more
cells with a full complement of PTEN (Fig. 1C), one patient had
four or more CTCs harboring both heterozygous and homozygous
PTEN loss, and four patients had four or more CTCs with both
heterozygous loss and normal PTEN (Fig. 2C). All cases with
heterozygous loss (n = 7) showed heterogeneity of PTEN loss but
only three of nine with homozygous loss showed heterogeneity. AR
gene copy number was available on CTCs for 33 patients: copy
number gain was invariably heterogeneous (Fig. 1D). No patient
had only one copy of AR in all their CTCs, whereas WBCs all
revealed one AR copy. Twenty-eight patients (85%) had CTCs
harboring a maximum of three copies of AR , 10 patients (30%) had
CTCs with a maximum of four or five copies, and 15 patients (45%)
had CTCs with more than five copies of AR (Supplementary Table
S7). There was no change in ERG and PTEN status in CTCs
collected from patients before starting and after progressing on
abiraterone acetate (n = 24). Similarly, there was no shift in AR
copy number with treatment with abiraterone acetate (n = 18;
Supplementary Table S7).
ERG gene status does not change with the development of
castration resistance. We then proceeded to compare the ERG
gene status of CTCs with that of archival diagnostic tumor tissue
acquired before the institution of first-line hormonal treatment
(n = 27) and of CRPC biopsies (n = 11) from the same patient. We
found that CTC ERG gene status matched the ERG gene status of
tumor tissues in all cases (Table 2). These data also showed that
all patients with a rearrangement of ERG in the therapy-naive
tissue had ERG-rearranged cancer in the CRPC tissue; similarly, no
CRPC tissue with ERG rearrangements was detected in patients
who did not have a rearrangement at baseline (n = 31). One patient
(patient 74) had class Normal and class Edel in his baseline
therapy-naive samples; all his CTCs were class Edel. One patient
(patient 70) had 70% class Edel and 30% class Esplit in his therapy-

naive samples; his CTCs were class Edel. Similarly, a second patient
(patient 2) had 65% class Esplit and 35% class Edel in his therapynaive samples; his CTC were class Esplit.
ERG remains expressed in CRPC. To confirm that ERG
expression was maintained in CRPC samples with a TMPRSS2-ERG
fusion detectable by FISH (break-apart assay), quantitative RT-PCR
was performed for ERG exon 11 in CRPC tumor samples, and this
was matched with therapy-naive samples. Expression of ERG exon
11 was significantly higher in all ERG-rearranged CRPC samples
(n = 9) compared with CRPC samples with no ERG rearrangement
(n = 6; P = 0.0004, Mann-Whitney test). Post–abiraterone acetate
treatment biopsies were performed in three patients, but tumor
tissue was identified in only one patient. A decrease in expression
of ERG exon 11 was observed in this patient while responding to
abiraterone acetate. Similarly, androgen-responsive expression of
ERG exon 11 increased 3.5-fold in VCaP cell lines treated with
R1881 (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S8).
Clinical implications of assessing ERG gene status. As there
was no change in ERG gene status with castration resistance or
with abiraterone acetate treatment, we combined ERG gene FISH
data from CTCs (n = 49), CRPC tumor tissue (n = 17), and
archival, therapy-naive tissue (n = 53) to obtain an ERG gene
class for 77 patients (we have been unable to acquire neither
tumor tissue nor CTC for the remaining 12 patients). Thirty-two
patients (41%) had an ERG rearrangement, and 45 did not.
Nineteen patients were on a stable dose of steroids at the start of
the study and continued the same steroid dose in combination
with abiraterone acetate, and 58 patients were treated with
single-agent abiraterone acetate. All patients were participating in
phase I/phase II clinical trials with a primary efficacy end point
of PSA decline as recommended by PSA working group I criteria
(19). The presence of an ERG rearrangement was associated with
the magnitude of maximal PSA decline on abiraterone acetate
(P = 0.007, Mann-Whitney test for trend), with 12 of 15 patients
(80%) who had a z90% PSA decline, having an ERG rearrangement compared with 20 of 62 patients (32%) who did not have a
z90% PSA decline being ERG rearranged (P = 0.001, Fisher exact
test). The association between an ERG rearrangement and
declines in PSA of a smaller magnitude than 90% approached

ERG gene class. B, WT ERG gene ploidy (class 3+ Normal). Twelve patients had CTC harboring three or more copies of WT ERG. C, heterogeneity of PTEN

significance (association with z50%, P = 0.07, Fisher exact test;
Table 3).

TMPRSS2-ERG tumors may represent a subgroup of prostate
cancers that are enriched for tumors that remain exquisitely
sensitive to CYP17 blockade. However, 12 of 32 TMPRSS2-ERG
tumors (37%) did not have a z50% PSA decline, suggesting that
they had primary resistance to abiraterone acetate. Moreover,
hormone-dependent fusions of ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5, although
less common, could account for abiraterone-sensitive ERGunrearranged cancers (1, 22, 23). As PSA is an androgen-regulated
gene, the association observed between PSA declines, the primary
end point of these studies, and ERG rearrangements may not
translate into an improvement in overall survival: this will require
further evaluation in larger, future studies.

Discussion
The 100% concordance in ERG gene status of CRPC (tumor
biopsies and CTCs) and therapy-naive tissues acquired several
years and treatments previously suggests that, despite multiple foci
of cancer with different ERG gene status existing in a single
prostate (20, 21), the cancer that is most commonly detected on
trans-rectal biopsy of the prostate will result in blood-borne
metastases after progression on castration. These data suggest that

Figure 3. ERG remains expressed in CRPC. The bar chart represents expression of tumor samples obtained from patients treated on clinical studies of abiraterone
acetate, normalized to the expression of ERG by VCAP cells in normal serum. Columns in red on the left side of the chart represent patients with an ERG
rearrangement confirmed by FISH and a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcript confirmed by RT-PCR. Columns in blue in the middle of the chart represent patients with no
ERG rearrangement. Striped columns signify a therapy-naive sample matched to a castration-resistant sample. One patient had castration-resistant samples collected
immediately before starting abiraterone acetate and a second set of samples acquired while receiving treatment with abiraterone acetate (column with diamond
pattern ). The columns in green on the right side of the chart represent expression of ERG by VCaP cells in charcoal-stripped serum, FBS, and added synthetic
androgens (R1881). Bars, SE. The maximal percentage of PSA decline, and time-on-treatment on abiraterone acetate for these patients is reported in Supplementary
Table S8. TNPC, therapy-naive prostate cancer; AA, abiraterone acetate; CSS, charcoal-stripped serum; R1881, synthetic androgen added to serum.

Novel antiandrogens that target the AR and small molecule
inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/PTEN are
being evaluated in clinical trials as a strategy for reversing
resistance to hormone therapies (6). However, of the patients with
evidence of PTEN loss, 7 of 13 had z50% declines in PSA and one
(who had 100% homozygous PTEN loss and a class 2+ Edel ERG
rearrangement) had a z90% PSA decline. Similarly, tumor
responses were observed in patients with AR copy number gain.
Moreover, loss of PTEN was not observed at the development of
resistance to abiraterone acetate. As this study reports multiple
subclasses for every gene locus, for example, homozygous PTEN
loss in 100%, 80% to 100%, 60% to 80%, 40% to 60%, and<40% of
CTCs, and ERG gene rearrangements by deletion or rearrangement
and with or without duplication, large numbers of patients need
to be evaluated to investigate the effect of specific genetic
aberrations on clinical outcome. This will be pursued in an
ongoing randomized double-blind phase III trial of abiraterone
acetate and prednisone versus prednisone and placebo. The
significant genetic heterogeneity observed at the PTEN and AR
loci contrasts to ERG homogeneity and, together with the absence
of a change in ERG gene status with the development of castration
resistance, could suggest that rearrangement of ERG is an earlier
event in prostate carcinogenesis than gain of AR and, in some
cases, loss of PTEN. Moreover, CTC genetic heterogeneity for AR
amplification and PTEN loss may have important implications
for the development of therapeutics that target either the AR or

PI3K/AKT pathways. Finally, these data strongly suggest that
circulating, non-apoptotic nucleated, EPCAM+ CK+ CD45- cells
isolated from CRPC patients are malignant in origin and confirm
that hormone-regulated expression of ERG persists in CRPC.

Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest
All patients participating in clinical trials were sponsored by Cougar Biotechnology.
Processing of blood samples for CTC evaluation was conducted in a research
collaboration with Immunicon Corporation. However, neither Cougar Biotechnology
nor Immunicon Corporation had any input to the study design, analysis of samples, or
interpretation of the data. J.F. Swennenhuis, R. Levink, F. Coumans, R. Sipkema, and
L.W.M.M. Terstappen were employees of Immunicon Corporation, which has been
purchased by Veridex LLC. Veridex LLC owns the rights to CTC evaluation using the
technology described in this manuscript. L.W.M.M. Terstappen is a consultant for
Veridex LLC. A. Molina is a full-time employee of Cougar Biotechnology, which holds
the rights of development of abiraterone acetate. J.S. De Bono has served as unpaid
consultant for Cougar Biotechnology. Abiraterone acetate was discovered at The
Institute of Cancer Research, which therefore has a commercial interest in the
development of this agent. G. Attard, D. Olmos, A.H.M. Reid, R. A’Hern, J. Moreira,
R. Riisnaes, E. Thompson, C.P. Carden, C. Parker, D. Dearnaley, S.B. Kaye, C.S. Cooper,
