DNA methylation determines nucleosome occupancy in the
50-CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes
A Portela1, J Liz1, V Nogales1, F Setién1, A Villanueva2 and M Esteller1,3,4

Promoter CpG island hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is an epigenetic hallmark of human cancer commonly
associated with nucleosome occupancy and the transcriptional silencing of the neighboring gene. Nucleosomes can determine the
underlying DNA methylation status. Herein, we show that the opposite is also true: DNA methylation can determine nucleosome
positioning. Using a cancer model and digital nucleosome positioning techniques, we demonstrate that the induction of DNA
hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deﬁcient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is
associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Most
importantly, the establishment of a stable cell line that restores DNMT1/DNMT3B deﬁciency shows that nucleosomes reoccupy their
positions in de novo methylated CpG islands. Finally, we extend these results to the genomic level, combining a DNA methylation
microarray and the nucleosome positioning technique. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome
occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated
CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of
the other.

INTRODUCTION
In general, CpG island methylation is associated with gene
silencing.1 CpG islands are usually unmethylated in normal cells,
although some of them (B6%) become methylated in a tissuespeciﬁc manner during development or in differentiated tissues.2
However, in tumoral cells many tumor suppressor genes are
silenced through CpG island methylation.1–3 Hypermethylated
promoters are also associated with a closed chromatin
conﬁguration, characterized by a histone modiﬁcation pattern
featuring deacetylation of histones H3 and H4, methylation of
histone H3 lysines 9 and 27 and demethylation of histone H3K4.1–4
It is also important to keep in mind the packaging of the DNA
into nucleosomes. Nucleosomes can act as a barrier to transcription, regulating access to the DNA in the nucleus. During
transcription elongation, the DNA is unwrapped from the
nucleosome, allowing the RNA polymerase II to progress.5 In
fact, the precise position of nucleosomes around the transcription
start sites (TSSs) can be crucial to gene expression regulation.6 The
loss of a nucleosome directly upstream of the TSS is closely
correlated with gene activation, whereas the occlusion of the TSS
by a nucleosome is associated with gene repression.7–8 The
relationship between DNA methylation and nucleosome
positioning has been precisely described in the mutL homolog 1
(MLH1) gene: a methylated CpG island prevents nucleosome
depletion from the promoter, thereby reducing the MLH1
transcription level.9 In this regard, DNA methyltransferases

(DNMTs) are preferentially targeted to nucleosome-bound DNA,
even for methylated non-CpG island promoters.10 Thus,
nucleosome positioning should help shape the DNA methylation
landscape.11–12 Other DNA methylation-related enzymes (methylCpG binding domain protein 2, MBD2; methyl-CpG binding
protein 2, MeCP2) are also known to be enriched when
nucleosomal methylated DNA is compared with methylated
DNA.13 The effect of DNA methylation in the nucleosomal
context enhances transcription repression, as CpG methylation
induces tighter wrapping of DNA around the histone core and a
change in topology.14
The objective of our study was to shed light on the relationship
between nucleosome positioning and DNA methylation,
assessing whether it is a unidirectional or a bidirectional
phenomenon. Nucleosome positioning can direct DNA methylation patterns,11–12 but can DNA methylation also determine
nucleosome positioning?

RESULTS
Local relationship between DNA methylation, gene expression
and nucleosome positioning
We studied both DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy in
the colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116 and its isogenic cell line
with double knockout of the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and
DNMT3B (DKO).15 We also studied the DNA hypomethylation

events and their association with putative nucleosome eviction
in the HCT-116 cell line treated with the demethylating agent
5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (Aza). We also wondered whether the
association between DNA methylation and nucleosome
positioning could be established de novo. To this end, we
generated a new cell line (DKO DNMT1/3B), stably reintroducing
DNMT1 and DNMT3B into the DKO cell line (Supplementary
Figure S1). Since the original description of the DKO cells, several
articles have dealt with the biological features of these cells,16–18
but herein, we have also developed doubling time determination,
colony formation, MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide) and nude mice subcutaneous growth assays
for HCT-116, DKO and DKO DNMT1/3B cells (Supplementary
Methods). Overall, DKO cells has a slower growth in doubling time,
colony formation, MTT and in vivo nude mouse tumor-growth
assays in comparison with parental HCT-116 cells, while the
reintroduction of DNMT1/DNMT3B enhances the growth of DKO
cells in the three analyses. (Supplementary Figure S1).
In order to test our hypothesis that DNA methylation can
determine nucleosome occupancy, we selected two well-known
50 -hypermethylated CpG islands of the tumor suppressor genes
retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB)19 and homeobox D1 (HOXD1)16
and two recently identiﬁed, potassium voltage-gated channel
subfamily G member 2 (KCNG2) and nephosis 2 idiopathic steroidresistant (NPHS2).20 The corresponding 50 -ends of these genes are
annotated as CpG islands by the University of California Santa
Cruz, UCSC and The National Center for Biotechnology
Information, NCBI genome browsers, except for RARB that it is
only formally recognized as a classical and canonical CpG island by
the NCBI data set, although it has been widely studied as such.1
For the four genes, we validated their DNA methylation status,
levels of expression and nucleosome positioning structure in an
average 850 bp area centered on their TSS. Bisulﬁte sequencing
(Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S2) was used for the DNA
methylation analyses, while expression was determined by
quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 1b) and semi-quantitative
reverse transcriptionPCR (Supplementary Figure S3). The studies
were performed in the following cell lines: HCT-116, HCT-116 Aza,
DKO and DKO DNMT1/3B. As a control, the same characteristics
were studied in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
gene (GAPDH) (Supplementary Figure S2) and the tumor
suppressor p53 (Supplementary Figure S4), which are unmethylated and exhibit a similar expression pattern in all cell lines used
here. DNA methylation status was checked in three overlapping
regions: one located upstream of the TSS, another containing the
TSS and the third downstream of the TSS (Figure 1a,
Supplementary Figure S2 and the primers are described in
Supplementary Table S1). The methylation patterns for each gene
were consistent in each case for the three regions studied.
HCT-116 cells presented HOXD1, RARB, KCNG2 and NPHS2 hypermethylated CpG island promoters (Figure 1a and Supplementary
Figure S2), and accordingly, no transcripts were expressed
(Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S3). On the other hand,
GAPDH and p53 (Supplementary Figure S4) promoters were
unmethylated and the genes were expressed. In the DKO cell line,
the four promoters were unmethylated (Figure 1a and
Supplementary Figure S2) and so expressed the four transcripts
(Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S3). When treating the HCT116 cell line with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine for 72 h the level of CpG methylation decreased (Figure 1a
and Supplementary Figure S2) with a concordant reactivation of
transcription in the HOXD1, RARB, KCNG2 and NPHS2 genes
(Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S3). The stable reintroduction
of DNMT1 and DNMT3B into the DKO cell line partially restored the
methylation pattern of HOXD1, RARB, KCNG2 and NPHS2 genes
(Figure 1a), while the GAPDH (Supplementary Figure S2) and p53
(Supplementary Figure S4) genes remained unmethylated. As
expected, the levels of expression of HOXD1, RARB, KCNG2 and
Oncogene (2013) 5421 – 5428

NPHS2 genes were lower in the DKO DNMT1/3B cell line than in the
DKO cell line (Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S3).
To assess the chromatin structure in the selected promoters, we
sought to obtain a general overview using the MspI accessibility
assay coupled to a real-time PCR, thereby to quantify the data. The
MspI accessibility assay is based on the chromatin structure: the
tighter the chromatin is packed, the less accessible it is to the
restriction enzyme. Thus, in an extreme case, the chromatin would
be so tightly packaged that the restriction sites would not be
accessible, thereby preventing the enzyme from digesting the
DNA, even when increasing units of restriction enzyme were used.
Conversely, the less compact the chromatin structure is, the
greater the digestion achieved when using increasing units of the
selected restriction enzyme (MspI). Therefore, a PCR performed on
a particular region will give an amount of product indirectly
proportional to the chromatin accessibility. To achieve greater
accuracy and reproducibility, we performed a semi-quantitative
real-time PCR to measure the amount of product obtained in each
case. HCT-116, HCT-116 treated with Aza, DKO and DKO DNMT1/
3B nuclei were extracted and incubated with increasing concentrations of MspI restriction enzyme (0, 100 and 400 U/ml).
Moreover a positive control of non-digested DNA and a negative
control of 100% digested DNA were also analyzed. For each gene,
three overlapping regions were studied: one located upstream of
the TSS, another containing the TSS and the third downstream of
the TSS. The results obtained were similar for all the studied
regions in each gene. The DKO cell line presented lower levels of
ampliﬁcation as the number of restriction enzyme units rose in all
genes tested (GAPDH, HOXD1, RARB, KCNG2 and NPHS2), thereby
revealing a more open chromatin structure (Figure 2a and
Supplementary Figure S5). DKO cells are not 100% fully accessible
to the enzymes because this cell line has not lost completely DNA
methylation.15 On the other hand, the HCT-116 cell line presented
a lower degree of ampliﬁcation following MspI digestion, and thus
an open chromatin structure only in the GAPDH (Figure 2a and
Supplementary Figure S5 data for MspI 400 U/ml; Supplementary
Figure S6 data for MspI 100 U/ml) and p53 (Supplementary Figure
S4) genes. Thus, these regions seem to be inaccessible to MspI in
HCT-116 cell line and are considered to have denser nucleosome
occupancy. When treating the HCT-116 cell line with 5-aza-20 deoxycytidine, the chromatin structure resembled that observed
in the DKO cell line, with higher DNA accessibility than untreated
HCT-116 cells (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figures S5 and S6). In
this regard, drug depletion of DNA methylation (5-aza-20 deoxycytidine treatment) resembled the genetic depletion of
DNMTs (DKO cells) for the DNA methylation pattern, the
expression levels and the chromatin accessibility assays. When
DNMT1 and DNMT3B were stably reintroduced to the DKO cell line
(DKO DNMT1/3B), denser nucleosome occupancy was observed,
correlating with the partial recovery of DNA methylation in the
promoters and a decrease in gene expression (HOXD1, RARB,
KCNG2 and NPHS2). The results obtained were consistent in the
three studied regions of each gene.
To avoid the false positive results in the MspI assay in case one
primer is positioned in the linker of a nucleosome occupied
region, we also designed an additional set of primers for these
experiments and the same data were obtained (Supplementary
Figure S7). In addition, although a NaCl (0.4 M) wash was used in
our assays to remove most non-histone-bound proteins from
chromatin,21 DNA accessibility could not fully reﬂect nucleosomes
as the binding of other proteins to DNA may also affect the
sensitivity to the restriction enzymes. Thus, we analyzed the
presence of a core histone protein to provide a more direct
analysis of nucleosomes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
analyses for the core histone H3, we found that the
hypermethylated promoter CpG islands of HOXD1, RARB, CDH11
and SCGB3A1 in HCT-116 cells are enriched in histone H3
(Supplementary Figure S8). In contrast, the unmethylated

promoter CpG islands of the four genes in DKO cells show a
depletion of core histone H3 (Supplementary Figure S8).
To measure nucleosome occupancy more accurately, we
adapted the methyltransferase-based single-promoter analysis
assay protocol,21 to make it suitable for studying methylated DNA
sequences (Figure 2b). For our purpose we used MspI, HaeIII and
AluI methyltransferases, which modify the cytosine residue (C5) of
the CCGG (external C), GGCC (internal C) and AGCT sites,
respectively. The use of the three methyltransferases allowed us
to increase the resolution of the in vitro methylation maps
obtained. HCT-116, DKO, HCT-116 treated with Aza and DKO
DNMT1/3B extracted nuclei were in vitro methylated using
the three methylases in a sequential incubation. Bisulﬁte
sequencing was then performed in the regions of interest
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

(Figure 2c and Supplementary Figures S9). Again, for each
gene, three overlapping regions were studied: one upstream of
TSS, another containing the TSS and the third downstream of
the TSS. The regions queried in the methyltransferase-based
single-promoter analysis assay experiments were all over 147 bp in
length to ensure nucleosome occupancy with an average size
of 243 bp (PCR amplicon sizes are detailed in Supplementary
Table S1). The results were similar for all the regions studied in
each gene and completely complementary to those obtained with
the MspI accessibility assay, although of higher resolution
(Figure 2c and Supplementary Figures S9). It is interesting to
note that greater differences in nucleosome occupancy were
observed in the region containing the TSS. An open chromatin
state was conﬁrmed for HOXD1, RARB, KCNG2 and NPHS2 genes in

nucleosome positioning, while reintroduction of DNMT1 and
DNMT3B activity in DKO cells resulted in nucleosome repositioning.
We also performed a time course study for DNA methylation
and nucleosome occupancy in HCT-116 cells upon the use of the
DNA demethylating agent using sixteen different time points
(Supplementary Figures S10). We have determined the DNA
methylation content and MspI accessibility of the three studied
regions of the HOXD1 and RARB promoter CpG islands for 192 h at
12-h intervals: six time points with continuous Aza treatment and
ten time points after Aza withdrawal (a total of 16 time points). We
have observed that the highest point of DNA accessibility is
observed 12 h later than the highest point of DNA hypomethylation (Supplementary Figure S10), suggesting that nucleosome
eviction might occur afterwards the loss of DNA methylation. In
addition, the withdrawal of the demethylating drug from the
media caused a progressive reduction of gene expression
(Supplementary Figure S11).

DNA methylation-nucleosome occupancy relationship is a
genome-wide phenomenon
Having demonstrated the relationship between DNA methylation
and nucleosome occupancy for particular genes, we wondered
about the extent of these mechanisms at a more global genomic
level. To address this, genomic and mononucleosomal DNAs from
HCT-116 and DKO cell lines were obtained and hybridized to the
Golden-Gate DNA methylation BeadArray (Illumina Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA), which contains 1505 CpG sites located between
 1500 bp and þ 500 bp around the TSSs of 808 cancer-related
genes22–25 (Figure 3a). The data were analyzed as follows
(Figure 3b). Sequences were considered to be hypermethylated
when the difference in CpG b-values between the HCT-116 and
DKO cell lines wasX70%. The ﬁrst comparison was made of the
genomic DNA from the HCT-116 and DKO cell lines. This allowed
us to select hypermethylated regions in the HCT-116 cell line (272
CpG sites corresponding to 190 genes). Mononucleosomal HCT116 and genomic DKO data were then compared. This second
comparison enabled the selection of hypermethylated HCT-116

regions that had escaped micrococcal nuclease digestion due to
their location around a nucleosome (252 CpG sites corresponding
to 181 genes). The DKO mononucleosomal data were used as a
negative control, conﬁrming that the unmethylated regions are
more easily digested by the micrococcal nuclease, as most of
them are not protected by a nucleosome. Finally, the joint
consideration of both comparisons enabled us to select the
genomic hypermethylated regions that had been protected from
MNase digestion due to their location around a nucleosome. The
overlapping region contained 228 probes corresponding to 162
genes (Supplementary Table S2). Thus, around 84% (83.82% in
the context of probes and 84.21% in that of genes) of
the hypermethylated regions selected in the genomic DNA from
the HCT-116 cell line were conserved in the mononucleosomal
HCT-116 DNA, meaning that 84% of the hypermethylated regions
are occupied by nucleosomes. The genome-wide results clearly
highlight the strong relationship between DNA methylation and
nucleosome positioning, implying that this relationship is
standard in methylated sequences, rather than being a rare
phenomenon.
To start the validation of the array results, we ﬁrst conﬁrmed that
the initially studied candidate gene RARB was also identiﬁed in the
genome-wide approach as having a hypermethylated promoter
CpG island occupied by nucleosomes (Supplementary Table S2).
CpG sites for the other three candidate genes (HOXD1, KCNG2 and
NPHS2) were not printed in the used DNA methylation microarray
platform and, thus, could not be characterized. To further
validate the array data, two candidate genes obtained by the
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

aforementioned epigenomic approach, were selected for further
detailed study: cadherin-11 (CDH11), a tumor suppressor gene
within our area of expertise26 and secretoglobin-3A1 (SCGB3A1), a
randomly selected candidate gene to avoid any kind of functional
bias. Both genes were analyzed to examine their DNA methylation
(Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure S12), gene expression
(Figure 4b) and nucleosome occupancy level (Figures 4c and d
and Supplementary Figure S13). In these cases, the DNA
methylation proﬁle was studied in three regions (upstream of
the TSS, containing the TSS and downstream of the TSS) for both
genes. However, the MspI accessibility assay was only performed in
two regions (upstream of the TSS and containing the TSS) on the
CHD11 gene, as the region downstream of the TSS did not contain
an MspI restriction site. Again, the results obtained for the different
regions of each gene were consistent in each cell line studied.
CDH11 and SCGB3A1 were methylated in the HCT-116 cell line and
unmethylated in the DKO. Treatment of HCT-116 cells with the
demethylating agent Aza, partially reduced DNA methylation in all
the studied regions. Reintroduction of DNMT1 and DNMT3B
activity in the DKO cell line partially remethylated the regions
studied (Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure S12). DNA methylation (HCT-116 and DKO DNMT1/3B) was always associated with the
suppression or reduction of expression, while unmethylated
promoters (DKO) or reduction of the methylation (HCT-116 Aza)
was associated with an increase in transcription (Figure 4b).
CDH11 and SCGB3A1 genes were also evaluated at the
nucleosome occupancy level through an MspI accessibility assay
(Figure 4c and Supplementary Figure S13) and adapted

and Supplementary Figure S13) techniques. Again DNA methylation
and transcription repression was associated with dense nucleosome
occupancy in the HCT-116 cell line, while unmethylated DNA was
associated with a high level of expression and low nucleosome
occupancy in the DKO cell line (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures
S12 and S13). Reduction of DNA methylation in the HCT-116 cell
line upon Aza treatment or reintroduction of the DNMT1 and
DNMT3B activity in the DKO cell lines created intermediate
outcomes, with around 50% DNA methylation (Figure 4a and
Supplementary Figure S12), intermediate expression (Figure 4b)
and intermediate nucleosome occupancy (Figures 4c and d and
Supplementary Figure S13). To avoid the false positive results in the
MspI assay in case one primer is positioned in the linker of a
nucleosome occupied region, we also designed an additional set of
primers for these experiments and the same data were obtained
(Supplementary Figure S14).
Oncogene (2013) 5421 – 5428

Thus, both the candidate gene approach and the genomics
assay support the conclusion that DNA methylation at the 50 -CpG
island of tumor suppressor genes contributes to determine
nucleosome occupancy at these regions and that DNA hypomethylation events remove nucleosomes from these CpG-rich
sequences surrounding the respective TSSs.
DISCUSSION
The wrapping of DNA around nucleosomes6 and DNA
methylation1 are two well-known mechanisms involved in gene
expression regulation. However, as has recently been reported,
the occurrence of these phenomena seems to be closely
associated rather than independent.11–12 On one hand, despite
the obstacle of reaching the DNA that a nucleosome might
present to an enzyme, the DNMT1 and DNMT3B enzymes are both
able to methylate CpG sites on nucleosomes assembled in vitro.27

Nucleosomal DNA is more methylated than ﬂanking DNA,
suggesting that DNMTs might be easily recruited to
nucleosome-bound DNA, enhancing DNA methylation in
nucleosomal DNA.11 In this regard, it is interesting to see the
remethylation patterns obtained when DNMT1 and DNMT3B are
stably reintroduced in the DKO cell line. The presence of
nucleosomes enhances the recruitment of DNMTs, making
methylation of the DNA that wraps the nucleosome easier.6–28 It
has been shown that DNMT3A and DNMT3B are strongly
anchored to nucleosomes containing methylated DNA.29 In fact,
this anchoring serves as a positive feedback mechanism, allowing
the faithful propagation of the DNA methylation pattern through
somatic cell divisions, and preventing DNMT3A and DNMT3B
degradation.30 Thus, nucleosome positioning helps shape the
DNA methylation landscape.11 However, in the remethylated
regions studied in the DKO DNMT1/3B, no nucleosomes were
positioned in the original DKO cell line. Thus it is improbable that
nucleosomes could guide the remethylation process in the DKO
DNMT1/3B cell line. Moreover, the lengths of more highly
methylated regions in the DKO DNMT1/3B cell line are not
associated with nucleosomal DNA length (B147 bp). It is therefore
conceivable that this also occurs the other way around:
reintroduction of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in DKO cell line
methylates DNA, nucleosomes become positioned and thus
transcription is repressed. Methylation and nucleosome
occupancy would act cooperatively to repress transcription.14–31
On the other hand, other reports have proposed that DNMT1 is
only loosely associated with chromatin, mostly at linker or
nucleosome-free regions, while DNMT3A and DNMT3B tend to
be associated with nucleosomes containing already methylated
DNA.29 Indeed, in mammals, an I662N substitution in DNMT3B is
responsible for the higher afﬁnity of this enzyme for nucleosomal
DNA.28 Moreover, DNA methylation also seems to inﬂuence the
structural properties of DNA, reducing the afﬁnity of DNA for the
histone octamer.32 However, the detected changes in nucleosome
formation and translational positioning according to the CpG
methylation status of the studied genes were subtle.33
Furthermore, the decreased afﬁnity of the octamer by
methylated DNA29 might suggest that our observed nucleosome
depletion upon DNA hypomethylation events, might involve
additional structural constraints other than simple histone/DNA
interactions. The complexity of the process is shown by the ﬁnding
that, although in the majority of the genome, nucleosomal DNA is
preferentially methylated,11 speciﬁc sequences such as CTCF
(CCCTC-binding factor) sites might not adhere to this trend.34
Our data suggest that DNA methylation and nucleosome
positioning shape each other in a complementary, bidirectional
manner: in our model, DNA methylation determines nucleosome
positioning, but in other contexts nucleosome occupancy
determines DNA methylation patterns. In our study, DNA
hypermethylated 50 -CpG islands (HCT-116) were always associated
with low or null levels of gene expression, while unmethylated
promoters (DKO) were correlated with higher levels of gene
expression. In addition, transcriptional repression was also
correlated with closed chromatin domains with dense nucleosome occupancy, while actively transcribed genes had lower
nucleosome occupancy levels. 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine treatment
and DKO cells had reduced DNA methylation levels, increased
gene transcription and decreased nucleosome occupancy, relative
to the untreated/wild-type HCT-116 cell line. Reintroduction of
DNMT1 and DNMT3B activity in the DKO cells caused an increase
of DNA methylation, repression of gene transcription and an
increase in nucleosome occupancy. These results suggest a close
correlation between DNA methylation, transcriptional repression
and high nucleosome occupancy. This relationship is not only
local but also genome-wide. In addition, if nucleosome positioning
affects the DNA methylation landscape,11–12 our evidence
suggests that the reciprocal process might also occur.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human cancer cell lines
HCT-116 colon cancer cells and double DNMT1  /  and DNMT3B  / 
(DKO) cells were grown as previously described.15 HCT-116 cells were
treated with 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (1 mM) for 72 h. The DKO DNMT1/3B cell
line was obtained by stably reintroducing the DNMT1 (cloned in a pCDNA3
vector with Zeocin resistance) and DNMT3B (cloned in a pIRES vector with
Puromycin resistance) genes. The DKO DNMT1/3B cells were cultured in
1/400 Zeocin and 4.7 Puromycin concentrations.

DNA methylation analysis
DNA methylation was determined by PCR analysis after bisulﬁte modiﬁcation. Bisulﬁte genomic sequencing was carried out as previously described.16
A minimum of eight colonies of each sequence and sample were
automatically sequenced to determine the pattern of methylation. Bisulﬁte
genomic-sequencing primers are shown in Supplementary Table S1.

Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR expression analysis
RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was then treated with DNAse I
(Ambion, Grand Island, NY, USA), and 1 mg was retrotranscribed with
Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA).
Real-time PCRs were performed in an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System, using 40 ng of complementary DNA for each
ampliﬁcation. Expression values were normalized with respect to GAPDH
expression. Reverse-transcription PCR primers were designed in different
exons to prevent DNA ampliﬁcation (Supplementary Table S1).

Extraction of nuclei
Growing cells were trypsinized and washed twice with cold phosphatebuffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold RSB adding
Nonidet P40 to a concentration of 1% and kept on ice for 10 min. After
incubation, cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 800 g at 4 1C. The
supernatant was discarded and nuclei were resuspended in RSB plus
NP40. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 800 g at 4 1C. Nuclei were
washed with RSB without NP40 and centrifuged for 5 min at 5 000 r.p.m. at
4 1C. The supernatant was discarded and the nuclei were resuspended in
the corresponding buffer.

MspI accessibility assay
Nuclei were resuspended in 1x MspI buffer to give 106 nuclei per 400 ml.
Nuclei from each cell line were digested in a series of increasing MspI
restriction enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
concentrations (0, 100 and 400 U/ml) at 37 1C for 1 h. Reactions were
stopped by adding 100 ml of stop solution (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.6 M
NaCl, 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and 400 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubating at
37 1C for 2 h. DNA was puriﬁed by phenol/chloroform extraction and
ethanol precipitation. Amplicons were ampliﬁed and quantiﬁed through
real-time PCR in an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System.
Results were normalized with respect to a region that does not have any
MspI restriction site. The results shown are the means of at least three
independent experiments amplifying each sample in triplicate. PCR
primers are shown in Supplementary Table S1.

In vitro methylation footprinting
We adapted the methyltransferase-based single-promoter analysis assay
protocol21 for use with methylated sequences. We substituted SssI
methyltransferase for MspI, HaeIII and AluI methyltransferases (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Extracted nuclei (B106) were
incubated for 30 min ﬁrst with 60 U of HaeIII, then with 60 U of MspI and
ﬁnally with 60 U of AluI methyltransferases. A 1x phosphate-buffered saline
wash was done between incubations and nuclei were resuspended in the
corresponding buffer. The ﬁnal reaction was stopped by adding 100 ml of
stop solution (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.6 M NaCl, 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and
400 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubating at 37 1C for 2 h. DNA was puriﬁed
by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Naked DNA
was used as a positive control to check the efﬁciency of the
methyltransferases.

Obtaining nucleosomal DNA
To prepare mononucleosomal DNA, 106 nuclei were resuspended in 500 ml
MNase buffer. Then, 500 U/ml of MNase (Roche) were added and tubes

were incubated for 0.5–10 min at 37 1C. The reaction was stopped by
adding EDTA to a ﬁnal concentration of 20 mM and SDS to a ﬁnal
concentration of 1%. The suspension was centrifuged at 14 000 r.p.m. for
15 min. The supernatant containing the nuclease digested nuclei was
incubated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K overnight at 37 1C. DNA was
treated with RNase, extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with
ethanol and ﬁnally resuspended in TE buffer. The DNA obtained was run
on an agarose gel to produce a nucleosomal DNA ladder. The
mononucleosomal band, corresponding to a 147 bp band, was recovered
from the gel and the DNA was puriﬁed.

DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning proﬁling using
bead arrays
Methylation was assessed at 1505 CpG sites using Illumina Goldengate
Methylation Arrays, as previously described. In this work, genomic DNA
from HCT-116 and DKO cell lines was hybridized, wherein all the sequences
with a difference of at least 70% between the two cell lines were
considered to be hypermethylated in HCT-116 (genomic HCT116
hybridization signal–genomic DKO hybridization signalX0.7). We next
determined which of the methylated sequences were protected from
MNase digestion due to nucleosome occupancy. The hybridization results
of HCT116 mononucleosomic DNA were compared with DKO genomic
DNA hybridization results, the sequences with an enrichment of 70% in the
hybridization signal being considered to be protected (mononucleosomal
HCT-116 hybridization signal–genomic DKO hybridization signalX0.7).
