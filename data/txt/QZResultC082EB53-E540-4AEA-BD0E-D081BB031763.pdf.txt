ABSTRACT
Objective: EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition) contributes to tumor
progression and metastasis. We aimed to investigate the effects of EMT on CDDP
resistance in HNSCC (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma)-cells.
Methods: EMT was induced using conditioned medium from a tumor cell/fibroblast
co‑culture. HNSCC cells were alternatively treated with TGF-β1. The response to CDDP
was evaluated with viability and clonogenic assays.
Results: Treatment of SCC-25/ Detroit 562 cells with conditioned medium
increased viability of the tumor cells. Moreover, it doubled the IC50 of CDDP of SCC-25
cells from 6.2 μM to 13.1 μM (p < 0.001). The IC50 of CDDP of Detroit 562 cells was increased
following treatment with conditioned medium from 13.1 μM to 26.8 μM (p < 0.01).
Colony forming ability after treatment with 5 or 10 μM CDDP was significantly higher
in HNSCC cells treated with co-culture conditioned medium than in controls (p < 0.05).
Treatment with TGF-β1 had no effect on the IC50 of CDDP (p > 0.1).
Conclusions: Cell free medium from a co-culture was able to induce EMT in
HNSCC cells. Co-culture treated HNSCC cells revealed increased viability and were
less sensitive to CDDP treatment. TGF-β1 also induced a mesenchymal phenotype,
but did not alter resistance to CDDP in HNSCC cells.

INTRODUCTION

pathways, which form a complex with Smad 4, leading to
the expression of EMT-activating transcriptional factors
such as Snail/Slug [7]. Two major hallmarks of EMT
in epithelial tumor cells are increased expression of the
intermediate filament vimentin and decreased expression
of E‑cadherin [3]. We recently reported that EMT in
HNSCC-cell lines results in enhanced cell proliferation
[8]. In this study, we analyze if EMT increases CDDP
(Cisplatin) resistance in two HNSCC cell lines.
SCC‑25 cells were orignially isolated from the
primary tumor of a patient with tongue carcinoma [9].
SCC‑25 cells form tumors in SCID mice but not in
athymic nude mice suggesting less aggressive behavior.
Moreover, SCC‑25 induced tumors do not develop
regional or distant metastasis in mouse models [10].
In contrast, Detroit 562 cells grow tumors and develop
regional and lung metastases when injected in nude mice
[11]. Detroit 562 was isolated from the malignant pleural

Most studies on chemotherapy resistance of tumor
cells focus on genetic or phenotypic alterations of the
cancer cell itself. However, there is growing evidence
that the stroma of solid tumors interacts with cancer cells.
Tumor-stroma interaction is considered a significant
determinant of disease progression and metastasis [1,
2]. Stromal fibroblasts induce epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor cells [3]. EMT is a reversible
cellular process mainly induced by paracrine secretion
of small molecules by tumor‑associated fibroblasts [4].
Among these small molecules, transforming growth
factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is thought to be one of the most
relevant mediators [5, 6]. TGF-β1 interacts with TGF-β1
two type I and two type II transmembrane kinase
receptors. These receptors activate Smad 2 and 3 signaling

effusion of a patient with pharyngeal carcinoma [12, 13].
Previously, we had induced EMT by co‑cultivation
of SCC‑25 or Detroit 562 cells and fibroblasts [1]. The
resulting co‑culture conditioned medium containing
EMT-promoting factors was used in this study to induce
EMT in pure SCC‑25 or Detroit 562 cells. In a second
experimental arm, tumor cells were treated with TGF‑β1.
In a third experimental arm tumor cells were treated with
co-culture conditioned medium and a neutralizing dose of
anti-TGF-β antibody. SCC‑25 and Detroit 562 cells treated
with standard cell culture medium served as control
in a fourth experimental arm. Changes of vimentin and
E‑cadherin gene expression and protein synthesis, which
were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and by western blotting were used
to confirm EMT. Cell viability was determined with MTT
assays and colony‑forming ability was investigated using
clonogenic assays [14]. Response to CDDP was assessed
by cell viability and Clonogenic assays.

A neutralizing assay with anti-TGF-ß antibody
did not reduce the influence of co-culture conditioned
medium on cell viability (1.45±0.03; p > 0.1). The number
of colonies in clonogenic assays did not differ between
standard‑medium (3116±654) and co‑culture conditioned
medium (1805±131; p > 0.5). Furthermore treatment with
TGF-β1 (2547±80) or co-culture conditioned medium
and anti‑TGF‑β (1496±119) antibody had no influence on
clonogenity of SCC-25 cells (p > 0.1) (Table 1).

Conditioned medium did not induce an EMT like
phenotype in detroit 562 cells
Treatment with co-culture conditioned medium
did not induce significant phenotypic changes in
Detroit 562 cells. Vimentin expression (0.59±0.04×10-3
vs. 0.58±0.2×10-3, p > 0.1) and E‑cadherin expression
(3.6±2.6×10-3 vs. 4.6±0.2×10-3, p > 0.1) did not show
significant changes after treatment with co-culture
conditioned medium. Treatment with TGF-β1 induced
EMT-like phenotypic changes in Detroit 562 cells. TGF-β1
increased vimentin expression about ten fold (5.6±1.4×10-3
vs. 0.58±0.2×10-3, p < 0.0001), but failed to reduce
E-cadherin expression (17.5±1×10-3, p > 0.1). At protein
level, both, conditioned medium and 1  ng/ml TGF-β1
did not induce changes in vimentin expression (46 kD
band) (Figure 2). E‑cadherin showed a marginal decrease
after treatment with co-culture conditioned medium and
1 ng/ml TGF-β1. Viability increased after treatment with
co-culture conditioned medium (2.1±0.04) compared
to controls (1.9±0.02, p = 0.001), whereas TGF-β1
had no influence on cell viability (1.9±0.005, p > 0.5).
A neutralizing assay with anti-TGF-β antibody did not
reduce the effect of co-culture conditioned medium
on cell viability (2.2±0.01, p > 0.05). Treatment
with co-culture conditioned medium, TGF-β1 and
co‑culture conditioned medium/anti‑TGF‑ß antibody had
no effect on clonogenity in Detroit 562 cells (standard
medium 948±153, CM: 983±38, TGF-β1 876±160; antiTGF-β: 1000±18; p > 0.1) (Table 1).

RESULTS
Co-culture conditioned medium and TGF-β1
induced EMT in SCC-25 cells
SCC‑25 cells were treated with standard medium
(control), co-culture conditioned medium or 1 ng/
ml TGF‑β1 for 3 days. EMT-related gene expression
was subsequently measured using real-time PCR
and compared with β-actin expression (Figure 1).
Relative gene expression of the mesenchymal marker
vimentin was higher in SCC-25 cells treated with coculture conditioned medium (56.6±22.4×10-3) than in
control cells (27.1±10.3×10-3; p < 0.001). In contrast,
E-cadherin gene expression was down regulated
following treatment with co-culture conditioned medium
(1.9±1.1×10-3) compared to controls (2.7±0.9×10-3;
p < 0.02). EMT-like gene expression changes were
also observed in SCC-25 cells treated with 1 ng/ml
TGF-β1. TGF-β1 treated cells revealed significantly
higher vimentin gene expression (488.1±48  ×  10 3)
than control cells (74.4±10.1× 10-3; p < 0.001)
and lower E-cadherin gene expression levels (0.8±0.3× 10-3)
compared to controls (1.6±0.9× 10-3; p < 0.01). At protein
level both, co-culture conditioned medium and 1 ng/ml
TGF-β1, increased a 46 kD vimentin band. E-cadherin
showed a marginal decrease after treatment with co-culture
conditioned medium and 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 in SCC-25 cells.
Moreover, cell viability of SCC‑25 cells treated with
co‑culture conditioned medium was higher (1.25±0.11)
than in untreated controls (1.09±0.23; p < 0.01).
In contrast, treatment with TGF‑β1 decreased cell viability
(0.69±0.007; p < 0.001) compared to controls treated with
albumin‑containing medium (Figure 3A).

Treatment with co-culture conditioned medium
increased CDDP resistance of SCC-25 cells
Cell cultures were exposed to CDDP ranging from
0 µM to 50 µM and cell viability was assessed with MTT
assays. Half-maximal inhibitory CDDP concentration was
calculated using 4-parameter nonlinear logistic regression.
The IC50 for native SCC-25 cells was 6.24 μM (95% CI
5.43 μM to 7.06 μM). Treatment with conditioned medium
significantly increased CDDP-chemoresistance (Figure
3A). It more than doubled the IC50 of SCC-25 cells to
13.05 μM (95% CI 10.35 μM to 15.76 μM; p < 0.005).
In addition to viability assays, clonogenic assays
following exposure to 5 µM CDDP were performed in

The treatment with co-culture conditioned medium did not increase both vimentin bands. The positive control HGF fibroblasts showed a
strong band at 57 kD. E-cadherin was detected at 120 kD. SCC-25 cells at control conditions showed a strong 120 kD band, which was
reduced after treatment with co-culture conditioned medium or with 1 ng/ml TGF‑β1. Detroit 562 cells showed a light band at 120 kD,
which was marginally reduced after treatment with co-culture conditioned medium or with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 The control HG-fibroblasts did
not not express protein at 120 kD with the vimentin antibody. Loading control was done using anti-GAPDH antibody.

control and co‑culture conditioned medium treated cells.
In control cells, 5 µM CDDP reduced colony number
from 3116±654 to 82±8 (91% reduction). In co-culture
conditioned medium-treated cells, 5 µM CDDP reduced
colony number from 1805±131 to 1106±381 (39%
reduction). This means CDDP induced significant less
(p = 0.013) reduction of colony numbers in co‑culture
cells than in standard‑culture cells, suggesting an
increased CDDP‑chemoresistance following exposure
to conditioned medium (Figure  4A-4C). In addition,
SCC‑25 cells were incubated with 1ng/ml TGF‑β1
and CDDP to evaluate the specific effect of TGF‑β1
on CDDP resistance (Figure 3A). The IC50 following
TGF‑β1 exposure (6.6 µM; 95% CI 5.47 µM to 7.73 µM)
did not differ from the IC50 following standard medium
(p > 0.2). TGF-β1 treatment did not alter clonogenity
after treatment with 5 µM CDDP (95±11, p > 0.1,
89% reduction) compared to controls (Figure 4C).
To support the observation that TGF-β1 is not
involved in co-culture conditioned medium induced
chemoresistance, a neutralizing dose of anti-TGF-β (1.5
µg/ml) was added to the co-culture medium before viability
and clonogenity assays were performed. Despite that, the
chemoresistance mediating effect of co-culture conditioned
medium was preserved. Also with anti-TGF-β, the IC50 of
CDDP following administration of co-culture conditioned
medium remained significantly higher than in control
experiments (10.4 μM, 95% CI 9.2 to 11.5 μM (p < 0.05)
(Figure 3A). The effect of co-culture conditioned medium
on clonogenity after treatment with 5 μM was not altered
by anti-TGF-β antibody treatment (1281±20, 13%
reduction, p > 0.5) (Figure 4C).

DISCUSSION
EMT is a reversible cellular process caused by the
interaction of epithelial tumor cells and tumor‑associated
fibroblasts. During EMT, epithelial tumor cells acquire
characteristics of a mesenchymal phenotype. It is thought
to be a relevant mechanism of cancer progression [5, 6].
In this study, we were interested in the effect of EMT
on CDDP resistance of HNSCC tumor cells in vitro.
Co‑cultures of epithelial and mesenchymal cells are
frequently used to model EMT in vitro. Here we used a
direct fibroblast-tumor cell co‑culture conditioned medium
to induce EMT in the two human papilloma virus-negative
HNSCC cell lines SCC‑25 and Detroit 562.

Co-culture conditioned medium induced EMT
and increased cell viability
Co-culture conditioned medium upregulated
vimentin expression and downregulated E‑cadherin
expression in SCC-25 cells. As expected for an epithelial
cell line, baseline vimentin expression was low and baseline
E-cadherin expression was high. Similar phenotypic
changes were induced by treatment with 1 ng/ml
TGF-β1. This TGF-β1 concentration has previously
been measured in co-culture conditioned medium using
enzyme-linked immunoassays (data not shown). TGF-β1
is considered a major factor for phenotypic changes in
EMT [15].
Especially 46 kD vimentin protein levels increased
in SCC-25 cells after treatment with co-culture conditioned
medium and TGF-β1. 46 kD vimentin had been previously
identified in epithelial cells under stress conditions [16].
On the protein level, co-culture conditioned medium
and TGF-β1 slightly reduced the E-cadherin expression.
The fact that EMT can be induced by cell free medium
supports the concept that EMT mainly depends on
paracrine signaling [8, 17, 18]. Beyond upregulation of
mesenchymal and downregulation of epithelial markers,
the co-culture conditioned medium increased cell viability
in SCC 25 cells (p < 0.01). EMT-associated increase of
cell viability is in line with several recent reports [4, 19].
This effect was not mediated by TGF-β1, since
TGF-β1 reduced cell viability in SCC-25 cells (p < 0.001).
It was demonstrated that Smad 4 is active in SCC-25
cells, which might enable a tumor suppressive effect of
TGF-β1 [20]. Apparently, other factors than TGF‑β1
are responsible for increased viability in SCC-25 cells
exposed to co-culture conditioned medium and these

Treatment with co-culture conditioned medium
increased CDDP resistance of detroit 562 cells
The same experiments were repeated in Detroit 562
cells. The IC50 of CDDP for native Detroit 562 cells was
13.1 μM (95% CI 9.8 to 16.5 μM). Treatment with coculture conditioned medium more than doubled the IC50 to
26.8 μM (95% CI 12.7 to 41.0 μM) (p < 0.01) (Figure 3B).
In control cells 10 μM CDDP reduced the colony number
to 252±69 (73% reduction). In co-culture conditioned
medium treated cells 10 μM CDDP reduced the colony
number to 490±1 (50% reduction) (p < 0.05) (Figure 4D).
Treatment with 1 ng/ml TGF‑β1 had no influence on the
IC50 of CDDP in Detroit 562 cells, the IC50 remained stable
with 16.9 μM (95% CI 14.9 to 19 μM, p > 0.05) (Figure
3B). TGF-β1 treatment did not alter clonogenity after
treatment with 10 µM CDDP (193±6, p > 0.3) compared
to controls cells (Figure 4D). Accordingly, treatment with
co-culture conditioned medium containing a neutralizing
dose of anti-TGF-β1-antibody (1.5 µg/ml) did not change
the IC50 of CDDP in Detroit 562 cells compared to
co‑culture conditioned medium treated Detroit 562 cells

factors are even able to override TGF-β1 induced viability
reduction in SCC-25 cells. Moreover, the discrepancy
of co-culture conditioned medium and TGF-β1 induced
effects on EMT and cell viability implies that observed
changes in cell viability are not caused by the acquisition
of a mesenchymal phenotype (EMT), but rather an EMT

associated effect of epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk in
the tumor microenvironment.
Despite lack of phenotypic changes, coculture conditioned medium increased cell viability
of Detroit 562 cells (p = 0.001), supporting the
concept that EMT-induction and changes in cell

resistance following epithelial-mesenchymal interaction
are not yet identified, but it doesn’t seem to be TGF-β1.
Gilbert et al. reported that IL-6 (Interleukin-6) and
TIMP (Tissue Inhibitor of metalloproteinase) could be
possible tumor stroma-derived factors, which promote
the survival of cancer cells [24]. Other fibroblastproduced mediators which might mediate EMT-associated
chemoresistance, are HGF (human hepatocyte growth
factor), MED12 (mediator complex subunit 12) and PGE2 (Prostaglandine-E2) [15].

Co‑culture conditioned medium induced CDDP
chemoresistance
The main goal of this study was to determine
if EMT is associated with increased CDDP
chemoresistance. Medium from an epithelialmesenchymal co‑culture more than doubled the IC50
of CDDP in MTT assays in both cell lines (p < 0.001)
(Figure 2). These results are consistent with the outcome
of clonogenic assays. The anti-clonogenic effect of
CDDP was significantly reduced after pretreatment
with co-culture conditioned medium (p < 0.05)
(Table 2). Hazlehurst et al. observed in 2001 that tumor
microenvironment is involved in cell cycle arrest and drug
resistance. This so called microenvironment related drug
resistance is mediated through survival pathways activated
as a result of cell-cell-adhesion (cell-adhesion mediated
drug resistance) and extracellular matrix derived adhesive
signals, which reduce the cytotoxic effect of CDDP [21].
Niessner et al. reported that the release of paracrine
signaling factors produced by carcinoma‑associated
fibroblasts stimulate survival pathways such as the Aktpathway and reduce cytotoxic effects of chemotherapies
[22]. We treated HNSCC cell lines with a cell-free
conditioned medium, suggesting the latter being
responsible for the increase in CDDP resistance in
our experimental setting. Similar results have been
demonstrated in lung cancer cells. In these cells treatment
with fibroblast‑conditioned medium increased Paclitaxel
resistance by restraining Paclitaxel induced apoptosis by
activation of both extracellular signal-regulated kinases
(Erk) 1/2 and Akt kinase. In this study, treatment with
fibroblast‑conditioned medium did not alter the CDDP
resistance of lung cancer cells in vitro [23].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) cells were
purchased from Cell Line Service, Eppelheim, Germany
[1, 25]. They were cultured in DMEM‑low glucose (PAA,
Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine
serum (FBS) (PAA), 2 mM l‑glutamine, 100 units/ml
penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. SCC-25 were
purchased from German Collection of Microorganisms
(DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) and Detroit 562 cells
from the Cell Lines Service (Eppelheim, Germany),
and were cultured in DMEM/F12 (PAA) supplemented
with 10% FBS (PAA), 2 mM l‑glutamine, 100 units/ml
penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin [1].

Co-culture conditioned medium
For the production of co-culture conditioned
medium, 4 x 104 /ml SCC-25 or Detroit 562 cells and 1 x 104
HGF cells/ml were plated in 250 ml cell culture flasks
and cultured for 72 hours in 15 ml foetal bovine serumcontaining medium (1:1 mix of DMEM/F12 (PAA) and
DMEM‑low glucose (PAA) supplemented with 10%
foetal bovine serum (FBS) (PAA), 2 mM l‑glutamine, 100
units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Then
the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s PhosphateBuffered Saline (DPBS) (Biowhittaker®, Belgium) and
the serum‑containing medium was replaced by 15 ml
albumin‑containing medium (7,5 ml DMEM/F12 (PAA)
and 7,5 ml DMEM-low glucose (PAA) supplemented with
bovine serum albumin (BSA, PAA) (0.4 g albumin/ 100
ml medium) replacing the protein content of 10% FBS,
2 mM l‑glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/
ml streptomycin). Albumin‑containing medium was left
48 hours on the co-culture allowing interacting epithelial
cells and fibroblasts to secrete EMT‑related factors into
the medium. Afterwards, the co‑culture conditioned
medium was collected and cells were counted. The
co‑culture conditioned medium was portioned according
to cell numbers as described by Hassona et al. [18]. The
co‑culture conditioned medium was sterile-filtered and

No effect of TGF-β1 on CDDP sensitivity
TGF-β1 did not increase the IC50 of CDDP of
HNSCC cells in vitro. The IC50 of control and TGF-β1
treated cells was remarkably similar. Consistently,
treatment with TGF-β1  had no influence on colony
forming ability following CDDP-treatment. To support
this observation, an additional experiment with co-culture
conditioned medium supplemented with a neutralizing
anti‑TGF‑β  antibody was performed. Anti‑TGF‑β  did
not antagonize chemoresistance induction by co-culture
conditioned medium in both cell lines. This supports the
concept that increased CDDP-resistance is not caused, but
merely associated with the acquisition of a mesenchymal
phenotype. The factors leading to increased CDDP

PMSF) / 106 cells. The cell suspension was vortexed and
incubated 3-times for 15 minutes on ice, homogenized
in 22G needles and centrifuged at 15000 g, 15 minutes,
4 °C. The cleared supernatant was subjected to protein
concentration measurement using the Pierce 660 nm
protein assay (Pierce, Rochford, IL, USA) according to
the instructions of the manufacturer. 15 µg protein from
all samples was subsequently processed for western
blot analysis published previously [17], using primary
antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin (clone VI10) IgM (Exbio, Prague, Czech Republic) at 1:200, or
mouse monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (clone 36) IgG2a (BD
Transduction Laboratories, BD Austria, Vienna, Austria)
at 1: 2500, or anti-GAPDH (clone 6C5) IgG1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 1: 200. For
signal detection horseradish peroxidase coupled matched
secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent substrate
of Thermo Fisher Scientific (Vienna, Austria) were
used in conditions suggested by the manufacturer. The
chemilumescence signal was imaged by an Azure C500
documentation system (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria).

To induce EMT in the first experimental arm, SCC-25/
Detroit 562 cells were treated with 7 ml co‑culture
conditioned medium per 50 ml cell culture flask for 72
hours. The medium was changed daily. To assess the
effects of TGF‑β1 in the second experimental arm,
SCC‑25/ Detroit 562 cells were cultivated in albumincontaining medium supplemented with TGF‑β1 1 ng/ml
(R&D Systems®, Minneapolis, US). Exposure conditions
were the same as in the first experimental group, i.e.,
TGF‑β1 supplemented medium was used over a period
of 72 hours and media were changed daily. A TGF-β1
neutralizing assay was performed in the third experimental
arm. SCC-25 cells and Detroit 562 were therefore treated
with anti- TGF-β 1,-2,-3 antibody (R&D SystemsTM,
Biomedica, Vienna; Austria) 1.5 µg/ml medium, as
neutralizing dose assayed by the provider and 7  ml
co‑culture conditioned medium per 50 ml cell culture flask
for 72 hours. Exposure conditions were the same as in the
other experimental groups. In the fourth experimental arm,
standard medium was used with identical media changes.
At the end of the stimulation period, cells were used
for RNA extraction, protein isolation, MTT assays and
clonogenic assays, respectively.

RNA extraction, reverse transcription and realtime RT-PCR

Treatment of the cells with CDDP and IC50
determination

A fraction of SCC‑25/ Detroit 562 cells was
harvested and RNA was isolated using TRIzol® reagent
following the manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion®, Life
technologiesTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham,
MA, USA). RNA concentrations were determined
by photometric measurements (BioPhotometer plus
6132, Eppendorf, Germany). Total RNA was reverse
transcribed by M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (GeneON,
Ludwigshafen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions in a MyiQTM cycler (BIO-RAD Laboratories,
Inc., US). Real-Time quantitative PCR (qPCR) of copyDNA transcripts was performed in a MyiQTM cycler
(BIO-RAD Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, US) using
iTaqTM Universal SYBR® Green Supermix (BIO-RAD
Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, US). β-Actin primers
were purchased from InvitrogenTM (Darmstadt, Germany),
while E-cadherin and vimentin primers were provided
by Eurofins MWG Operon, Inc. (Ebersberg, Germany).
β‑Actin functioned well as a housekeeping gene and did
not show significant changes across the three treatment
conditions. Moreover, the size of the Real-Time PCR
products was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis
analysis.

Following stimulation SCC‑25/ Detroit 562 cells
were treated with increasing doses of CDDP (0 μM, 1 μM,
2.5 μM, 5 μM, 7.5 μM, 10 μM, 20 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM)
for three days. The medium was changed daily. Cell
viability was plotted against CDDP‑concentration and
IC50 was calculated employing a four-parameter nonlinear
regression model [26]. For the clonogenic assays, 2 × 104
cells were plated in 250ml cell culture flasks. After
stimulation they were treated with 5 μM CDDP for three
days. The media were changed daily.

MTT- assay
Cell viability was evaluated by MTT-assays using the
tetrazolium salt method. The MTT‑assay is a quantitative
colorimetric method used to determine metabolic activity
[27]. After three days of CDDP treatment, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml
MTT salt (in DMEM/F12 (PAA) supplemented with 10%
FBS (PAA), 2 mM l‑glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin,

and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) was administered to the
cells (100 μl). Cells were incubated for 4h at 37°C and
then the formazan reaction product was dissolved using
10% sodium dodecylsulphate in 10 mM HCl at 37°C for
12 hours. Absorbance at 550 nm was measured with a
microtiter plate reader (Athos 2010, Salzburg, Austria).
The MTT‑tests were performed in four independent sets
containing at least six biological repeats.

Clonogenic assay
For analysis of the anti-clonogenic effect of CDDP
on the tumor cells we used the modified clonogenic assay
described by Phuk and coworkers [14]. SCC‑25/ Detroit
562 cells were washed with PBS and cultured in 250 ml
tissue culture flasks in DMEM/F12 (PAA) supplemented
with 10% FBS (PAA), 2 mM l‑glutamine, 100  units/
ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 14 days.
After 14 days, cultures were fixed and stained in 0.5%
gentian violet dissolved in methanol. Subsequently, the
stained flasks were scanned in 1200 dpi resolution using
a commercial flatbed scanner. Based on the resulting
micrographs, colonies were counted and occupied
areas were measured semi-automatically using a macro
written in imageJ/FIJI macro language [28]. Background
subtraction was performed on single images using rollingball-algorithm [29]. Micrographs were subjected to color
deconvolution [30] and filtered using a Fourier band-pass
filter. Colonies were segmented using auto-thresholding
algorithms [31-35]. Segmented colonies were counted
and occupied areas were measured. The clonogenic assays
were performed in three independent sets.

Data analysis
Data were presented as mean +/- standard deviation
(SD) unless indicated otherwise. The IC50 +/- 95%
confidence intervals (CI) of CDDP were calculated
with four-parameter nonlinear logistic regression using
CurveExpert Professional (Daniel Hyams, Hixson,
TN, USA). The results of real time PCR analysis were
analyzed with GraphPad Prism 4.03 (GraphPad Software
Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). Mean values among groups
were compared with unpaired t-tests. MTT-changes in coculture conditioned medium treated cells vs. controls were
tested with unpaired t-test. For evaluation of clonogenic
assays, a two-factorial analysis of variance with colony
number as the response parameter was used. Cell culture
medium (co-culture vs. standard) and CCDP exposure (0
µM vs 5 µM or 10 µM) served as factors. The interaction
term served to indicate cell‑culture mediated differences
in CDDP sensitivity. For this data analysis, SPSS 22 was
used (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA)
