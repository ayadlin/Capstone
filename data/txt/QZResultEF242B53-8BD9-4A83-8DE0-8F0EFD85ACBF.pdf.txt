Abstract
Carcinogenesis is a complex process tightly regulated at multiple levels by posttranslational modifications. Epigenetics plays a major role in cancer development,
all stable changes to the gene expression process that are not a result of a direct
change in the DNA code are described as epigenetics. Epigenetic processes are
regulated by post-translational modifications including ubiquitination which can
directly affect either histones or transcription factors or may target their co-factors
and interacting partners exerting an indirect effect. Deubiquitination of these target
proteins is equally important and alterations in this pathway can also lead to cancer
development, progression and metastasis. Only the correct, unaltered balance
between ubiquitination and deubiquitination ensures healthy cellular homeostasis. In
this review we focus on the role of deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes in various aspects
of epigenetics including the regulation of transcription factors, histone modifications,
DNA damage repair pathways and cell cycle regulation. We discuss the impact of
those processes on tumourigenesis and potential therapeutic applications of DUBs
for cancer treatment.

Introduction

lysosomal degradation of proteins [6]. The role of K27
and K33 poly-ubiquitination is less understood however,
they have been linked to innate immunity and immune
responses.

Ubiquitination is one of the most important
post-translation modifications (PTMs) responsible for
regulating the stability and activity of modified proteins.
For the ubiquitin molecule to be attached to its target
protein it initially has to be activated by an E1 enzyme
during an ATP-dependent reaction, which is followed by
conjugation of ubiquitin by an E2 class enzyme allowing
E3 ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate target proteins directly
or indirectly [1], [2], [3] .
The consequences of ubiquitination depend on the
type of chains formed during the process [4]. Proteins can
be mono-, multi-mono- or poly-ubiquitinated. Ubiquitin
contains seven lysine (K) residues with poly-ubiquitin
chains linked through the K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48
and K63 residues. Mono-ubiquitination and K63 polyubiquitination have been linked to regulating protein
activity [5]. K6, K11, K29 and K48 poly-ubiquitin chains
control protein stability with K6 and K48 chains targeting
proteins for proteosomal degradation, K11 is involved in
endoplasmic reticulum mediated degradation pathways
and control of cell cycle progression and K29 in regulating

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs)
Just as every action provokes a reaction all of the
major post-translational modifications can be reversed.
Enzymes that reverse PTMs are equally important
to normal homeostasis as those that initially modify
proteins. Protein ubiquitination by the E3 ligases can be
reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes [7]. DUBs can be
divided into five families; ubiquitin carboxy - terminal
hydrolases (UCH), ubiquitin specific proteases (Usp),
Otubain/Ovarian tumour - domain containing proteins
(OTU), Machado - Joseph Domain (Josephin domain)
- containing proteins (MJD) and Jab1/MPN domain
associated metalloisopeptidase domain proteins. UCH,
Usp, OUT and MJD proteins are all thiol proteases
containing an active site cysteine which serves as a
nucleophile facilitating the attack on lysine-glycine

isopeptide bonds of ubiquitinated proteins. Jab1/MPN
domain associated metalloisopeptidase domain proteins
differ from the other DUB classes as they utilise a JAMM
zinc metalloproteinase domain to break the bond between
their target proteins and ubiquitin.
With increased appreciation for the critical
importance of ubiquitination in cellular processes, DUBs
role in health and disease is becoming a new focus of
scientific research. Recent advances in the field uncovered
a growing number of DUB substrates. DUBs control the
stability and activity of multiple proteins crucial in cellular
proliferation and survival including p53 - the guardian
of the genome [8], [9], MDM2 [10], androgen receptor
(AR) [11], [12], histones [13], [14], PHLPP and PHLPPL
Akt phosphatases [15], [16], [17], Notch [18], NF-κB
[19], [20], β-catenin [21], [22] and many more. It is now
understood that a tight balance between ubiquitination
and deubiquitination is required for cellular survival
underlying the equal importance of E3s and DUBs.

to the DNA sequence itself and can be passed to daughter
cells are referred to as epigenetics. These changes include
DNA methylation, histone modifications and alterations
to the activity of repressors and transcription factors. All
of these processes result in altered transcriptome and
affect cellular growth, survival and homeostasis; as such
epigenetics play a crucial role in cancer development
and progression [23]. DUBs can regulate all levels of
epigenetic changes, by deubiquitinating proteins and
changing their activity and / or stability DUBs control the
levels of methylases and demethylases, histone proteins
and their binding partners, repressors and transcription
factors (Figure 1). DUBs can have both activating and
repressing effects on gene transcription depending on
their target proteins and the type of ubiquitin chain that
is being removed. Additionally, DUBs can alter ubiquitin
chains rather than remove them completely by for example
deubiquitinating K48-linked chains and leaving the target
protein in a mono-ubiquitinated state which results in
altered protein fate. In this review we will focus on the role
of DUBs in epigenetics and resulting cancer development.
We will also review the potential therapeutic aspects of
targeting DUBs to affect cellular epigenetics.

Regulation of epigenetics by
deubiquitination

P53 is a crucial tumour suppressor acting as
a transcription factor responsible for regulating the
expression of multiple genes associated with stress
responses, cellular survival, growth and homeostasis
[27], [28], [29]. P53 can be directly deubiquitinated by
Usp42 which reverses its ubiquitination by MDM2 [9].
Usp42 forms a direct complex with p53 and controls
its activation in response to cellular stress; as a result
it regulates p53-dependent transcription and cell cycle
arrest. Usp7 is another DUB important for p53 activity
[8]. Usp7 regulates the polycomb complex and factors
associated with transcription including MDM2, p53 and
FOXO. Usp7 directly deubiquitinates and stabilises p53,
it is also necessary for p53 stabilisation by the tumour
suppressor ING1 [30]. Additionally, independently of its
deubiquitinase activity the DUB Usp7 regulates sequence
specific RNA binding of the core domain of p53 thereby
stimulating its transcriptional activity and expression of
p21 [31]. Consequently, Usp7 inhibition was reported to
inhibit cancer cell growth and increase apoptosis.
Some DUBs can control p53 stability independently
of their enzymatic activity. One such example is OTUB1
which can inhibit UbcH5. UbcH5 is an MDM2 cognate
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), as a result of its
inhibition p53 ubiquitination is abrogated leading to its
increased stability and activity [32], [33]. Through binding
to E2 enzyme Ubc13, OTUB1 also regulates the K63
ubiquitination of chromatin induced by DNA damage [34].
GATA3 serves as another example of a transcription
factor regulated by deubiquitination. GATA3 is a master
regulator of T helper cells (Th2) cell differentiation and
function; it controls early T cell development and is one
of only 3 genes mutated in over 10% of breast cancers
as it plays a key role in mammary gland development
[35], [36]. Recent reports demonstrate that GATA3
can be deubiquitinated by Usp21 which rescues it from
proteosomal degradation and stabilises GATA3 protein
levels [37]. This results in increased transcriptional
activity of GATA3 and highlights the role of Usp21 in
immune responses with Usp21 protein upregulated in
regulatory T cells (Tregs) from asthma patients, however
the role of this interaction in carcinogenesis still remains
to be established.
Both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling
pathways are also regulated by deubiquitination. Recent
reports identified proteasome associated DUB Usp14 as
an oncogene and a positive regulator of Wnt signalling via
deubiquitination of Dishevelled (Dvl) [38]. Depletion of
Usp14 attenuated downstream Wnt signalling which was
further evidenced when correlation between the levels of
Usp14 and β-catenin in colon tissues was observed. Usp14
was also up regulated in non-small cell lung carcinoma
where high levels correlated with decreased survival and
poor prognosis [39]. This was attributed to the oncogenic
properties of Usp14 with silencing causing cell cycle
arrest as a consequence of β-catenin degradation.

Regulation of transcription factors
Gene expression is controlled by transcription
factors that directly bind to DNA. Transcription factors
act in complexes with other proteins and DUBs can
affect their activity by deubiquitinating transcription
factors directly or by targeting their binding partners and
altering the stoichiometry of the complex. Usp12 activity
towards the androgen receptor (AR) is an example of
direct transcription factor deubiquitination [12]. AR is
a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and plays
a key role in the transcriptional regulation of numerous
genes important in the development of both normal and
malignant prostate. AR deregulation is the key feature of
prostate cancer (PC) development. Usp12 was reported
to deubiquitinate the AR resulting in its increased protein
stability and transcriptional activity [12]. As a result Usp12
promotes PC development with protein levels increased
in PC patients compared to benign controls. However,
AR has multiple ubiquitination sites and it is targeted by
a variety of E3s, as a result AR deubiquitination doesn’t
always promote transcription. Usp26 can directly bind
and deubiquitinate AR, acting as a co-regulator of the AR
by reversing AR activation and degradation by MDM2
ubiquitination depending on cellular context highlighting
the complexity of post-translational regulation [11].
Similarly, Estrogen Receptor (ER) can also be regulated
by deubiquitination, OTUB1 has been identified to target
ER-alpha affecting ER target gene transcription and
stabilising its protein levels on chromatin [24].
Sometimes it is not clear if DUBs control
transcription factors via direct deubiquitination or if their
regulation of the transcriptome is more via effects exerted
on histones that cause a signalling cascade affecting the
transcription factors. This is the case for Usp10, it was
initially reported to directly regulate p53 and AR by
deubiquitinating them and acting as a co-activator [25].
However, more recent reports indicate that the effects on
AR might be indirect via Usp10 activity towards monoubiquitinated histone H2A.Z [14]. As a result of Usp10’s
role in the regulation of histones and p53 it is frequently
overexpressed in breast and brain cancer patients where
its levels correlate with survival. In prostate cancer, with
increasing grade of disease, the cellular localisation of
Usp10 changes with expression becoming predominantly
nuclear allowing for higher activity towards H2A.Z.
Similarly MYSM-1 has been reported to indirectly
regulate the AR. MYSM-1 can activate transcription of
AR target genes via its involvement with p300 affecting
histone acetylation and deubiquitination and binding of H1
to the nucleosome [26].

decreases cell growth due to defects in mitosis. UbpM
similarly controls Hox gene expression via regulation
of H2A ubiquitination status. Ubiquitination of H2A
is known to contribute to the embryonic stem cell
(ESC) pluripotency by repressing lineage-specific gene
expression [45]. It has been reported that deubiquitination
of H2A by UbpM controls gene expression in ESCs with
UbpM binding to the promoter regions of multiple genes
in ESCs and regulating the H2A ubiquitination levels.
It is now established that UbpM is required for ESCs to
differentiate, as in its absence ubiquitinated H2A mediates
repression of lineage-specific genes expression abrogating
cellular differentiation [45].
Histone ubiquitination plays a vital role in both
DNA damage response and repair pathways (Table 1).
Increased mono-ubiquitination of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4
has been previously observed upon DNA damage. During
the early DNA damage response, DNA-PK, ATM and ATR
kinases phosphorylate a fraction of the H2AX variant of
H2A, which is commonly referred to as γH2AX [46],
[47]. RNF168 is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates histones
H2A and γH2AX during the DNA damage response [48],
this ubiquitination can be reversed by Usp3 [49]. Usp3
associates with chromatin and deubiquitinates H2A
at K13 and K15 and γH2AX at K118 and K119. As a
result Usp3 overexpression has been shown to impair the
accumulation of the BRCA1 and 53BP1 repair factors at
the DNA damage sites in response to DNA damage and
to counteract the activity of RNF168. Consistent with
these findings, Usp3 ablation caused accumulation of
DNA breaks and activation of DNA damage checkpoint
pathways. This pathway can also be reversed by other
DUBs, including Usp21 [50], OTUB1, Usp29 and
Usp44 [51]. Both Usp44 and Usp29 deubiquitinate H2A
with USP44 being recruited to the RNF168-generated
ubiquitination products at double stranded break sites [51].

An additional level of control of transcriptional
activity mediated by the nuclear receptors is provided by
the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyl 1 transferase) histone
acetyltransferase (HAT) complex. In addition to HAT
activity, SAGA has deubiquitinating activity, which is
required for the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors
with Usp22 being the active DUB subunit of SAGA
that removes ubiquitin from the histones H2A and H2B
[40]. As SAGA is a chromatin modifying transcription
coactivator complex which regulates the expression of
genes related to tumourigenicity and proliferation its
levels predict treatment failure and are also used as a
marker of recurrence, metastasis and resistance to therapy
with levels significantly increased in cancers, including
colorectal cancer [41], [42].

Regulation of histones
Mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A is one of
the key histone modifications, it is associated with
transcriptional repression by the polycomb group
proteins and maintenance of the genome integrity. H2A
is mono-ubiquitinated at K119 and it is estimated that
between five and fifteen percent of the H2A fraction is
mono-ubiquitinated at any one time compared to only
one percent of H2B. As previously discussed, Usp10 can
deubiqutinate the mono-ubiquitinated H2A.Z variant of
H2A which results in increased AR activity [14]. However,
H2A can also be deubiquitinated by MYSM1 (2A-DUB)
[26] and UbpM (Usp16) in a way that is independent
of its phosphorylation by CDK1 [43], [44]. UbpM
specifically deubiquitinates histone H2A, but not H2B.
This deubiquitination is required for dephosphorylation of
histone H3 on S10 resulting in chromosome segregation
during the mitotic entry. As a result, UbpM silencing

Ubiquitination of both H2A and H2B is equally
important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and there
are DUBs that specifically target histone H2B, including
Usp49 [52] and Usp42 [53]. H2B ubiquitination regulates
H3K4 and H3K79 methylation and impacts on the
chromatin structure [52]. Usp49 in complex with RVB1
and SUG1 yeast homologues deubiquitinates H2B, this
modification is required for efficient co-transcriptional
splicing of a large set of exons. Silencing Usp49 induces
relatively small changes in gene expression, however
alterations in H2B ubiquitination levels caused by Usp49
regulate U1A and U2B association with chromatin and
binding to nascent pre-mRNA. Consequently, Usp49 plays
a crucial role in co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing
[52]. H2B ubiquitination can additionally be reversed by
Usp7 resulting in epigenetic silencing of homeotic genes
[54].
Some DUBs are not as specific and have the
ability to deubiquitinate both histones H2A and H2B, for
example the closely related family of DUBs comprising
Usp1, Usp12 and Usp46. All three DUBs require
Uaf-1 (WDR48) for their enzymatic activity [55] and
additionally Usp12 and Usp46, but not Usp1, activity is
further enhanced by binding to WDR20 [56]. Usp12 and
Usp46 deubiquitinate both H2A and H2B and Uaf-1 is
required for this reaction [13]. Usp22 can also reverse
the polycomb complex mediated ubiquitination of H2A
and H2B causing multiple changes in gene expression
profiles including transcriptional activation of MDM2
and Hox [57], [58]. Recent reports however, indicate that
even though Usp22 is active towards both H2A and H2B
it preferentially targets H2B for which it is one of the main
DUBs.

controlled by chromatin remodelling and epigenetics.
As discussed in previous sections multiple DUBs
affect cell cycle indirectly by regulating transcription
factors that control cell cycle progression, including the
AR and p53, and by modulating histones. However, some
DUBs regulate cell cycle in a much more direct fashion.
DUBs can regulate cell cycle progression by controlling
the G2/M checkpoint. Specifically both Usp50 and UbpM
contribute towards this process. Usp50, even though it is
catalytically inactive, plays a role in cell cycle progression.
It associates with Hsp90 and controls Wee1 stability via
an Hsp90-dependent mechanism. Usp50 consequently
functions as a negative regulator of the G2/M checkpoint
[59]. UbpM regulates the same checkpoint but via a
different mechanism. Following S552 phosphorylation
UbpM translocates to the nucleus and regulates the cell
cycle G2/M phase progression and cell proliferation
[44]. Additionally, Usp22 directly deubiquitinates TRF1
(TBP(TATA box-binding protein)-related factor 1) to
regulate the transcription of cell cycle and apoptosis
genes [60] and inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53
by deubiquitinating SIRT1 histone deacetylase [61] and by
regulating MDMX stability [62].
Usp1 is a key protein involved in the DNA damage
response. Indeed inhibition of the Usp1-Uaf-1 complex
sensitises cells to chemotherapy. Usp1 counteracts the
mono-ubiquitination of PCNA which prevents recruitment
of low fidelity DNA polymerases in the absence of DNA
damage [63]. It is also involved in double strand DNA
break repair through the homologous recombination
pathway. Additionally, Usp1 deubiquitinates and
stabilises ID (Inhibitor of DNA binding) proteins 1,
2 and 3, as ID can inhibit differentiation this preserves
the undifferentiated state of cells [64]. Usp1 modulates
DNA replication, polymerase choice and DNA repair by
PCNA and as a result Usp1 knock-out mice are genetically
unstable and hypersensitive to DNA damage [65], [66].
Usp10 is involved in DNA damage response control
via regulation of the p53 protein. Upon DNA damage,
Usp10 is phosphorylated which is essential for Usp10 to
relocate to the nucleus, allowing it to stabilise p53 [67].
The DNA damage response is also regulated by the Chk2p53-PUMA pathway in response to double strand breaks
in vivo. This process is tightly controlled by Usp28 which
is necessary to stabilise Chk2 and 53BP1 in response to
DNA damage and is required for DNA damage induced
apoptosis [68]. Usp28 is found to be recruited to double
strand breaks and this is dependent on the 53BP1 protein.

Cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response
In normal cells most genes have an epigenetically
stable transcriptional status. However, some genes are
an exception to this rule as their sole purpose is to be
responsive to the outside stimuli including growth factors
and cellular contact. Those genes are most susceptible to
epigenetic changes and their expression is rapidly affected
by them. Dysregulation of epigenetics might result in
altered expression of these genes leading to cellular
transformation and malignancy. As a result, impact of
DUBs on cell cycle regulation and DNA damage repair
pathways deserves specific attention. The human genome
is continuously challenged by both endogenous and
exogenous insults potentially damaging the DNA which
can result in various types of damage including double
and single strand breaks, oxidative lesions and pyrimidine
dimers. Cells have developed multiple ways to counteract
and repair the DNA damage known as the DNA damage
response pathways. These responses can be divided
into two main groups; cell-cycle checkpoint activation
and DNA repair. Both of these mechanisms are tightly

Regulation of deubiquitinating enzyme activity
Activity and stability of multiple DUBs is regulated
by posttranslational modifications and interactions with
other proteins. Commonly enzymes are regulated by
phosphorylation, this is also frequent amongst DUBs. To
allow its activity towards p53, the Usp10 protein needs to
9661

be phosphorylated at T42 and S337 by ATM, this occurs
as a result of DNA damage and stabilises Usp10 allowing
it to translocate to the nucleus and deubiquitinate p53
[67]. Interestingly in prostate cancer with increased cancer
grade and metastasis the expression of Usp10 becomes
predominantly nuclear which could possibly be associated
with elevated DNA damage. Phosphorylation of Usp10
by ATM is also required for Usp10 antioxidant activity in
stress granules [69]. Phosphorylation of UbpM at Ser552
by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is also needed for
its translocation to the nucleus and regulation of the cell
cycle G2/M phase progression and cell proliferation but,
this phosphorylation is not required for its deubiquitinase
activity, substrate specificity and regulation of gene
expression [44]. Similarly, Usp7 short isoform (Usp7S)
can be phosphorylated by CK2 at S18 leading to its
protein stabilisation which subsequently increases the pool
of MDM2 and decreases the levels of p53 protein [70].
This is reversed upon irradiation by an ATM dependant
phosphatase PPM1G [70]. DUBs can play a role in
infection and immunity and their activity can be regulated
by bacterial kinases. During Yersinia infection OTUB1
can be phosphorylated by a bacterial kinase YpkA which
modulates cellular susceptibility to Yersinia invasion [71].
Many of DUB phosphorylation sites are highly
conserved throughout evolution. Yeast homologue of
Usp12 (Ubp9) has been shown to be phosphorylated and
this phosphorylation was lost upon deletion of both of its
co-factors Uaf-1 and WDR20 highlighting its potential
role in enzymatic activity [72]. Similarly close family
member of Usp12, Usp1 is also phosphorylated at S313
by CDK1 during mitosis, this modification is required
for its interaction with Uaf-1 as it lies within the Uaf-1
binding region (amino acids 235-408). Consequently, it
is also a pre-requisite for Usp1 DUB activity as complex
formation with Uaf-1 is required [73], [74]. Conversely
phosphorylation at S42 and S67 have not been attributed
any physiological roles to date [73]. S313 of Usp1 lies
within both the consensus sequence for CDKs and
also Usp1s region 307-330 responsible for APC/C
cdh1 mediated Usp1 degradation during G1 phase.
Consequently S313 phosphorylation plays a crucial role
in maintaining protein stability during mitosis as Usp1
is ubiquitinated during G1 by APC/C cdh1 leading to
its proteosomal degradation. Usp1 can be additionally
stabilised by CAPNS1 which activates Cdk5 resulting
in inhibition of cdh1 subsequently inhibiting Usp1
degradation [75].
Frequently the activity of deubiquitinating enzymes
is regulated by interactions with various binding partners.
TRAF2 can bind to Usp2a which inhibits its effect on K48
but not K63 linked poly-ubiquitin chains, consequently
the ratio between TRAF2 and Usp2a determines cells
sensitivity to cell death [76]. Usp10, alongside Usp13,
is regulated by binding to Beclin-1 which affects their
protein stability, activity and subsequent deubiquitination
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of target proteins [77]. Usp22 activity is regulated by
histone deacetylases, their inhibition abrogates the binding
of RNA Polymerase II to Usp22 promoter supressing its
transcription [78] .
DUB protein stability has a crucial role in regulating
enzymatic activity; some DUBs can auto-regulate
themselves others are ubiquitinated/SUMOylated. For
example, Usp7 is activated by its own C-terminal domain
[79]. Conversely, Usp1 has the ability to auto-cleave
itself at a di-glycine motif leading to its degradation [80].
OTUB1 is regulated by mono-ubiquitination at K59 and
K109 which is required for it to inhibit the E2 UhcH5
resulting in MDM2 inhibition and p53 activation [33].
Binding of OTUB1 and E2 enzymes, including UbcH5
and Ubc13, also regulates OTUB1 enzymatic activity
towards K48 ubiquitin chains [81]. Usp28 on the other
hand can be regulated by SUMOylation at the N-terminal
domain, this has a negative effect on its deubiquitinase
activity [82].
Splicing can also play a role in the regulation
of DUBs activity and cellular localisation. Both Usp7
and Usp21 have been reported to undergo alternative
splicing. Usp21 short variant lacks the nuclear export
sequence (NES) and as a result localises predominantly
in the nucleus however, that has no major effect on its
enzymatic activity as both full length and variant Usp21
affect H2A ubiquitination to a comparable degree in vitro
but variant was observed to be more active in vivo due to
its localisation [83].

Targeting DUBs
DUBs are key enzymes which regulate cellular
growth, survival and homeostasis through multiple
pathways including epigenetics, as such aberrations in
DUB signalling and activity can play crucial roles in
cancer development, progression and metastasis. This is
evidenced by multiple carcinogenic agents that exert their
effects via the DUB pathway. Carcinogenic properties of
nickel compounds have been attributed to the increased
ubiquitination of H2A and H2B [84]. However, nickel
compounds do not affect histone ubiquitination directly
but rather inhibit the DUBs responsible for reversing
this process, as such increasing the pool of ubiquitinated
histones. As a consequence, targeting DUBs might prove
to be a valid strategy for developing novel anti-cancer
therapeutics (Table 2).
Targeting DUBs as an anti-tumourigenic therapeutic
strategy has its proof of principle in the use of bortezomib,
a broad range inhibitor of the ubiquitin proteasome
system, in multiple melanoma treatment [85]. This
strategy is however limited by the lack of specificity of
bortezomib which results in toxicity. Targeting individual
DUBs that play a role in particular cancers is predicted
to be a much better strategy. However, targeting single
DUBs is a very complex challenge due to the high levels

of homology, particularly between the catalytically active
domains, and promiscuity. Most DUBs target multiple
proteins and additionally many of the DUB targets can
be deubiquitinated by more than one DUB. The same
DUB can target proteins from the same pathway that exert
opposing effects, for example Usp7 can deubiquitinate
both p53 and its E3 ligase MDM2 depending on
the circumstances. In this context broad spectrum
inhibitors targeting closely related families of DUBs
that deubiquitinate the same substrates might in fact be a
valuable strategy.
As mentioned previously multiple DUBs rely
on co-factors, such as WD40 proteins, for their activity
(Table 3), [86], [7]. This poses a very exciting drug design
opportunity and offers a chance for developing much more
specific agents when the binding of two proteins rather
than a conserved active domain of one of them is being
targeted. As previously discussed, Usp1 is responsible
for DNA damage response pathway regulation and its
activity is dependent on binding to its cofactor, Uaf-1.
This allowed for the identification of more specific agents
targeting the Usp1 protein’s interaction with Uaf-1 rather
than Usp1 directly, thus circumventing the potential
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

issue of sequence homology and conserved domains
within similar DUBs. Three Usp1 inhibitors explored
this strategy, Pimozide [87], ML323 [88], [89], [90] and
GW7647 [87] each targeting the Usp1-Uaf-1 complex in a
non-competitive manner. Usp1 known targets include the
Fanconi anaemia complex proteins, FANC1 and FANCD2,
PCNA and the inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) transcription
factors [87]. As Usp1-null mice have been shown to be
hypersensitive to DNA damage it is likely that targeting
Usp1 could increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA
damaging agents [66]. Multiple Usp1 inhibitors have been
identified via both compound library screening and drug
development programs. Therapeutic inhibition of Usp1
was previously reported to re-sensitise cisplatin-resistant
non-small-cell lung cancer cells to the drug [87]. This
result was confirmed by an observed increase in the monoubiquitination of PCNA and FANCD2 upon Pimozide
treatment which indicated successful targeting of Usp1.
Later reports supported this observation with the ML323
compound decreasing the cells ability to repair the DNA
damage and potentiating the effects of cisplatin [88]. The
authors proposed synthetic lethality as an explanation
for this observation; because the DNA damage repair

pathway is inhibited upon Usp1 targeting then damage
induced by cisplatin is not being repaired by the cells,
consequently resulting in cell death. More recently
developed compounds SJB2-043 and SJB3-019A inhibited
the salvaging of ID1, ID2, ID3, FANC1 and FANCD2
proteins by Usp1 from proteosomal degradation and as a
result caused an increase in cell death and sensitisation to
DNA damaging agents [91].
Usp7 is one of the most extensively researched
DUBs due to its role in regulating multiple key proteins
including p53, MDM2, PTEN, FOXO, the polycomb
complex and histones [92]. During cancer development,
Usp7 plays an oncogenic role as it promotes cellular
survival. Most recent attempts at targeting Usp7 include
development of P5091, HBX 19,818 and HBX 28,258
inhibitors [93]. All of these compounds were shown to
abrogate the effects of Usp7 on p53, they also inhibit
the enhanced tumourigenicity of claspin caused by Usp7
activity and increase apoptosis in cancer cells [94].
Promising data arose from the application of P5091 and its
second-generation derivative P22077 in an investigation
where both compounds were capable of increasing
survival when used as single agents in a xenograft study.
Additionally, when combined with standard treatments
synergistic effects and re-sensitisation were observed
for both compounds in multiple melanoma [95] and
neuroblastoma [96], respectively. These results are very
promising as resistance is one of the major challenges
of present cancer management. As such, developing
compounds focussed upstream of the present therapeutic
targets could help to both avoid developing future
resistance and also allow to re-sensitise patients resistant
to the available DNA damaging agents by exploring
synthetic lethality and combining them with inhibitors of
DUBs responsible for DNA damage repair.

making targeting more complex. Recently, Usp1 inhibitors
have been discovered which inhibit Usp1 by targeting its
interaction with Uaf-1, a protein binding partner required
for Usp1’s enzymatic activity, rather than by targeting the
active domain directly. This is a very exciting direction
which could offer a solution to DUB inhibitors design
providing both specificity and decreased toxicity. Multiple
DUBs rely on binding to other proteins for their activity
and stability and many of those interacting partners are
WD40 proteins just like Uaf-1 (Table 3), it does however
remain to be established if this strategy will prove
therapeutically advantageous.

Discoveries over recent years clearly indicate that
ubiquitination and deubiquitination regulate cellular
homeostasis and as a result deregulation of these processes
can promote cancer development and progression. DUBs
can affect carcinogenesis through multiple cellular
pathways with epigenetics being the main example.
Deubiquitination of histones, transcription factors and
their co-factors plays a major role in regulating epigenetics
by DUBs. As a result DUBs could be valuable therapeutic
targets in oncology. Although this field is still relatively
novel, recent advances indicate that targeting DUBs could
be an efficient strategy. Novel inhibitors aimed at both
Usp1 and Usp7 have been shown to re-sensitise cells to
known therapeutic agents and to have a therapeutic effect
when used independently in both the cellular setting
and in some xenograft models. DUBs might present a
challenge for compound design as their active domains
are often conserved and many of them are Cys-dependent
