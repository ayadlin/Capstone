ABSTRACT
Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 are found in a somatic
mosaic fashion in patients with multiple enchondromas. Enchondromas are benign
cartilaginous tumors arising in the medulla of bone. The mutant IDH1/2 causes
elevated levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
are the precursor of the osteoblastic, chondrogenic and adipocytic lineage and we
hypothesized that increased levels of D-2-HG cause multiple enchondromas by
affecting differentiation of MSCs. Bone marrow derived MSCs from different donors
were differentiated towards osteoblastic, chondrogenic and adipocytic lineage in the
presence or absence of 5 mM D-2-HG. Three of four MSCs showed near complete
inhibition of calcification after 3 weeks under osteogenic differentiation conditions in
the presence of D-2-HG, indicating a block in osteogenic differentiation. Two of four
MSCs showed an increase in differentiation towards the chondrogenic lineage. To
evaluate the effect of D-2-HG in vivo we monitored bone development in zebrafish,
which revealed an impaired development of vertebrate rings in the presence of
D-2-HG compared to control conditions (p-value < 0.0001). Our data indicate that
increased levels of D-2-HG promote chondrogenic over osteogenic differentiation.
Thus, mutations in IDH1/2 lead to a local block in osteogenic differentiation during
skeletogenesis causing the development of benign cartilaginous tumors.

Up to 87% of solitary or multiple enchondromas harbor
mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 [4–6].
Malignant progression towards secondary central
chondrosarcoma occurs in ~1% of solitary enchondromas
and up to ~50% in patients with multiple enchondromas
[8]. Central chondrosarcomas are malignant cartilageforming tumors that are located in the medulla of the
bone [9]. Central conventional chondrosarcomas carry
mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in 38–70% of primary central
chondrosarcomas (arising without a preexisting benign
enchondroma) and in 86% of the secondary central
chondrosarcomas [4–6].
Mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 are also found in acute
myeloid leukemia (~20%) [10], gliomas (60–80%) [11, 12],
and cholangiocarcinomas (7–28%) [13–15]. Isocitrate
dehydrogenase is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the
conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle.

INTRODUCTION
Enchondroma is a benign cartilage forming
tumor within the medullary cavity of the bone [1, 2].
Enchondromas can occur as solitary lesions, of which
the exact incidence is unknown as they are often
detected when radiographs are made for other reasons.
Multiple enchondromas are seen in patients with the
rare enchondromatosis syndrome. Different subtypes
of enchondromatosis are distinguished, of which the
most common ones are Ollier disease and Maffucci
syndrome, the latter distinguished by multiple spindle
cell hemangiomas in addition to enchondromas [2, 3].
We and others have shown that both these non-hereditary
syndromes are caused by somatic mosaic heterozygous
mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)
or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) genes [4–7].

Mutant IDH1/2 has been proven to have neo-activity for
the catalysis of α-ketoglutarate into D-2-hydroxyglutarate
(D-2-HG), but not to its enantiomer L-2-hydroxyglutarate
(L-2-HG) [16, 17]. Indeed, enchondromas and other
tumors with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 were shown to
have increased levels of D-2-HG [4]. The newly formed
oncometabolite D-2-HG shows structural similarities
with α-ketoglutarate, and as a result D-2-HG is able to
competitively inhibit α-ketoglutarate dependent enzymes,
such as TET2, thereby inducing epigenetic changes
including DNA hypermethylation and histone modification
[18]. Epigenetic changes due to mutant IDH protein were
demonstrated to impair hematopoietic differentiation of
hematopoietic precursor and leukemia cells [19–21] and to
repress neural differentiation of neurogenic precursor cells
[22]. Moreover, mutant IDH and D-2-HG prevent liver
progenitor cells from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation,
causing intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [23].
As the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) is the
precursor of the osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipocytic
lineage, we hypothesized that enchondromas and
chondrosarcomas result from altered differentiation
of MSCs during bone development. Our aim was
therefore to investigate whether IDH1/2 mutations and
the corresponding elevated levels of D-2-HG push the
differentiation of MSCs towards a more chondrogenic
phenotype by blocking osteogenic differentiation. We
therefore used human MSCs that were pushed towards
osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipocytic differentiation
in the presence or absence of D-2-HG, as a surrogate for
the IDH1 or -2 mutation. In addition, a zebrafish model
was used to evaluate the effect of D-2-HG on bone
development in vivo.

D-2-HG)). In the other MSC strains, no difference in the
slopes of the curves could be detected when comparing
activity between control conditions and D-2-HG.

Effect of D-2-HG on chondrogenic
differentiation of MSCs is variable
The effect of D-2-HG on chondrogenic
differentiation, evaluated after four weeks, was variable
in four donors when comparing pellets grown in the
presence or absence of D-2-HG. MSCs of a fifth donor
were  discarded due to an infection. All pellets revealed
some level of chondrogenic differentiation on haematoxylin
and eosin staining and all pellets were positive using
immunohistochemistry for collagen II, and negative for
collagen X. Morphologically, in two out of four samples
(MSC_TD_004 and MSC_TD_005) matrix deposition
as well as collagen II staining were increased when
grown in the presence of D-2-HG as compared to pellets
grown in the absence of D-2-HG (Fig. 2B). Moreover, an
increase in chondrogenic differentiation in the presence of
D-2-HG as defined using quantification of metachromasia
at toluidine blue staining was confirmed in MSC_TD_004
and MSC_TD_005 (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Fig 1). In
MSC42 there was only a slight increase in metachromasia
while in MSC30 an increase in chondrogenic differentiation
in the presence of D-2-HG could not be detected.

D-2-HG does not have a detectable effect on
histone modifications and DNA methylation in
MSCs after chondrogenic differentiation
As D-2-HG was reported to affect histone
modification and DNA methylation we evaluated histone
marks and DNA methylation using immunohistochemistry.
No difference in trimethylation of H3K4, H3K9 and
H3K27 could be detected in pellets grown in the presence
of D-2-HG as compared to pellets grown under normal
control conditions. We demonstrated high levels of the
histone modification marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3,
whereas staining for H3K9me3 was negative in both
conditions. Furthermore, 5-mC as well as 5-hmC was
highly expressed in pellets grown in control conditions
as well as in those grown in the presence of D-2-HG.
Results are shown in Supplementary Figure 2.

RESULTS
D-2-HG inhibits osteogenic differentiation
of MSCs
MSCs that were pushed towards osteogenic
differentiation in the presence of 5 mM D-2-HG, as a
surrogate for IDH1 or -2 mutation, showed impaired
calcification after three weeks as compared to MSCs
pushed towards osteogenic differentiation in the absence
of D-2-HG. More specifically, 3 out of 4 MSC strains
(MSC30, MSC42 and MSC_TD_005) showed near
complete inhibition of calcification in the presence of
D-2-HG, whereas in MSC16 alizarin red staining was
not affected (Fig. 1). The MSCs of a fifth donor failed to
show any osteoblast differentiation in control conditions.
Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined after three
weeks of differentiation by measuring at time intervals of
5 minutes during 140 minutes. This clearly demonstrated
reduced alkaline phosphatase activity in MSC_TD_005
(Fig. 1D) in the presence of D-2-HG (slope of 0.0538

D-2-hydroxyglutarate does not influence
adipocyte differentiation
As a control, we also evaluated the effect of D-2-HG
on adipocytic differentiation. All five MSC strains pushed
towards adipocytic differentiation for 3 weeks were able
to differentiate as demonstrated by the formation of lipid
vesicles using Oil red O staining. There was no difference
in adipocytic differentiation between MSCs grown in the
presence of 5 mM D-2-HG or PBS (Figure  3). Further

Embryos injected with PBS had an average of 3.42 alizarin
red positive vertebrate rings (n = 21). Injection with the
enantiomer L-2-HG resulted in an average number of
3.1 vertebrate rings (n = 21). In contrast, injections with
D-2-HG resulted in significantly less alizarin red positive
rings with an average of 0.93 vertebrate rings (n = 16)
(p-value < 0.0001), implicating impaired bone development
(Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 4). Experiments with PBS and
D-2-HG were performed twice at different time points, and
results were comparable. When evaluating the alcian blue
staining visually, no difference between zebrafish embryos
injected with D-2-HG, L-2-HG or PBS was seen.

D-2-HG impairs bone development in
zebrafish embryos
A zebrafish model was used to investigate the effect
of D-2-HG on bone development in vivo. The number of
alizarin red positive vertebrate rings, as a measurement
for development of the bony skeleton, at eight days post
fertilization (dpf), significantly differed between zebrafish
embryos with and without injection of D-2-HG at day 0.
Overall, the zebrafish embryos injected with D-2-HG
mainly showed zebrafish embryos lacking alizarin red
positive vertebrate rings while zebrafish embryos that
developed in the control conditions (no injection, PBS
or injection with the enantiomer L-2-HG) on average
revealed three vertebrate rings at 8 dpf. More specifically,
embryos without injection demonstrated an average

DISCUSSION
We here demonstrate that elevated levels of
D-2-HG block osteogenic differentiation and variably
promote chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal
stem cells. Elevated levels of D-2-HG are caused by
mutations in IDH1 or IDH2, which are frequently found
(up to 87%) in enchondromas. It is therefore likely
that a local block in osteogenic differentiation causes

the cartilaginous mass (enchondroma) during bone
development. In solitary enchondromas, the mass may
be detected later during life, when X-rays are made
for other reasons, or when enchondromas progress
towards secondary central chondrosarcoma. In multiple
enchondroma syndromes, the somatic mosaic distribution
of the IDH1 or IDH2 mutation in the MSCs during bone
development underlies the development of these lesions.
The amount of deformity of the skeleton depends on the

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutational load since the amount of cartilaginous masses
in these patients is variable.
We convincingly showed both in vitro as well as
in vivo that osteogenic differentiation is inhibited. Three
out of four MSCs showed a near complete inhibition of
calcification in the presence of D-2-HG, and zebrafish
embryos injected with D-2-HG at day 0, failed to develop
vertebrate rings when examined at day 8, whereas alkaline
phosphatase activity was reduced in one out of four MSCs.

showed a significantly reduced number of vertebrate rings (average 0.93), indicating that the presence of D-2-HG impairs bone development
in zebrafish embryos. The numbers represent one independent experiment. ****p < 0.0001.

The discrepancy between the alizarin red staining and the
alkaline phosphatase activity could be explained by the fact
that alkaline phosphatase activation occurs in earlier phase
of osteogenesis than osteogenic matrix production [24].
The mechanism of tumorigenesis is therefore
comparable to other tumors caused by mutations in the
IDH1 or IDH2 gene, as both in hematopoietic precursor
cells, in neurogenic precursor cells as well as in liver
progenitor cells, differentiation was impaired. This is
contributing to the development of leukemia, glioma
and cholangiocarcinoma, respectively, all of which are
described to have IDH1 or -2 mutations in a relatively
high percentage of tumors [19–23].
Interestingly, we here show that D-2-HG blocks
osteogenic differentiation, while mutations are virtually
absent in osteosarcoma and very frequent in cartilage
tumors [4]. The effect of D-2-HG on chondrogenic
differentiation of MSCs was variable, and seemed to
promote chondrogenic differentiation in only half of the
MSCs. The variable effect of D-2-HG on chondrogenic
differentiation of MSCs is not surprising, as we and others
have previously described large intra- and inter-donor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

variability of MSCs [25–27], which was the reason for
including MSCs of multiple donors in our study. In the
zebrafish embryos, no effect on the development of the
cartilaginous elements of the skeleton was seen at day 8.
Given the pluripotency of the MSC, which is thought to
be the progenitor cell of many different types of sarcomas,
our data indicate that elevated levels of D-2-HG, by
blocking osteogenic differentiation, enable or even promote
chondrogenic differentiation. Very recently, and in line with
our results, Hirata et al. reported dysregulated chondrogenic
differentiation with persistence of hypertrophic
chondrocytes in Col2a1-Cre;IDH1-KI mice, preventing the
normal replacement of cartilage by bone [28].
In addition to osteogenic and chondroblastic
differentiation, MSCs can also differentiate towards
adipocytes. We here show that D-2-HG does not affect
adipocytic differentiation of MSCs. This is in contrast to
the reduced adipogenic differentiation caused by D2HG
or by introduction of an IDH2 mutation in immortalized
embryo-derived 3T3-L1 cells [22]. These murine
3T3-L1 cells are known to be committed to spontaneous
adipogenic differentiation, while we studied the effect on
14837

human MSCs, which may explain the different results.
Furthermore, we also observed spontaneous adipocyte
differentiation in MSCs treated with D-2-HG under
osteogenic differentiation conditions, indicating a lack
of influence of D-2-HG on the ability of human MSCs to
differentiate into adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 3).
We used D-2-HG as a surrogate for mutations in
IDH1 or -2. Elevated levels of the oncometabolite D-2HG competitively inhibit α-ketoglutarate dependent
enzymes, such as TET2 [16]. TET2 normally alters the
epigenetic status of DNA by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine
(5 mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC). Indeed,
we previously showed hypermethylation in IDH1
mutant enchondromas [6]. D-2-HG also inhibits other
α-ketoglutarate dependent oxygenases [29, 30] such
as the Jumonji domain histone demethylases, thereby
increasing histone methylation as well [22]. More
specifically, trimethylation of H3K4, H3K9 and H3K27
was increased [18, 20, 22]. We evaluated the expression
of 5 mC, 5 hmC, H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3
in MSCs after 4 weeks of chondrogenic differentiation in
the presence or absence of D-2-HG and could not detect
any differences in expression. This could suggest that
the effect of D-2-HG on MSCs is independent of DNA
methylation or histone modification. However, we feel this
is unlikely as we cannot rule out that changes occurred at
an earlier time point before terminal differentiation. Also,
we were only able to perform immunohistochemistry
on the MSCs after chondrogenic differentiation, while
D-2-HG predominantly affected MSCs that were
pushed towards osteoblastic differentiation. Moreover,
immunohistochemistry is only semi quantitative and
will probably not detect minor changes. Also, neural
cells infected with mutant IDH1 showed increased
H3K9me3 levels only at passage 12, while changes in
other methylation marks were delayed and less prominent
[22]. As MSCs are slowly proliferating cells with a limited
lifespan it is not possible to acquire so many passages, or
to acquire sufficient cells for western blot analysis.
While we demonstrate an effect for D-2-HG
on bone development, this effect was absent for the
enantiomer L-2-HG. Patients with the organic acidurias
D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA) or L-2hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA) accumulate D-2-HG
or L-2-HG in urine, plasma and CSF, causing neurological
impairment at young age [31]. D-2-HGA is caused by
mutations in either the D2HGDH gene, encoding D-2hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D-2-HGDH), or
specific gain-of-function mutations in the IDH2 gene [32].
Interestingly, multiple patients with D-2-HGA have been
described with multiple enchondromas in the metaphysis of
the long bones combined with dysplastic vertebral bodies
(spondyloenchondromatosis) [33–35]. These aberrations
are not described for patients with L-2-HGA. This is
completely in line with our results in zebrafish, in which
only D-2-HG and not L-2-HG impairs bone development.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our results are in line with the hypothesis
that mutations in IDH1 or -2 are early events in the
development of cartilaginous tumors. We previously
reported that malignant progression towards central
chondrosarcoma renders chondrosarcoma growth
independent of these mutations. Inhibitors of mutant
IDH1 and -2 are currently in development and in clinical
trial [36–38]. However, the use of such a mutant IDH1
inhibitor (AGI-5198) decreased D-2-HG levels in a dose
dependent manner in three chondrosarcoma cell lines with
endogenous IDH1 mutations, whereas proliferation and
migration were not affected [39]. Furthermore, global gene
expression, CpG island methylation as well as histone
H3K4, -9, -27 trimethylation levels remained unchanged
after 20 passages of continuous treatment with AGI-5198
[39]. Thus, while mutations in IDH1 or -2 are not essential
for chondrosarcoma proliferation, the results of the present
study show an effect of D-2-HG on differentiation of
MSCs during bone development, promoting chondrogenic
and inhibiting osteogenic differentiation, indicating a
crucial role for IDH1/2 mutations in the development of
benign enchondromas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Bone marrow derived human multipotent
mesenchymal stem cells of in total five healthy
donors(MSCs) were cultured in low glucose DMEM
(22320-022; Gibco, Invitrogen Life-Technologies)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (758073; Greiner Bio One) and
1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (100 U/ml). Cells were
grown at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 95% air and
5% CO2. Phenotyping of MSCs was done as described
previously using FACS analysis [40]. Written informed
consent was obtained from all donors prior to bone marrow
harvesting according to the procedures as accorded by
the LUMC ethical board (protocol number P11.089). All
samples were handled in a coded (anonymized) fashion.

Compounds
D-2-hydroxyglutarate (RC402; PepTech Corporation)
and L-2-hydroxyglutarate (90790; Sigma-Aldrich) were
dissolved in PBS.

Osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation
Cells were seeded at a density of 15 000 cells/cm2
in 0.1% gelatin coated plates. Culture medium used was
α-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% glutamax and 1%
P/S. For adipocyte differentiation, medium was additionally
supplemented with 0.25 μM dexamethasone (SigmaAldrich), 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich),
14838

Oncotarget

insulin 100 μg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5  mM 1-methyl3-isobutylxantine (IBMX) (Sigma-Aldrich) and after
4  days of culture 50 μM indomethacin (Sigma-Aldrich)
was added. For osteoblast differentiation, medium was
additionally supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid,
0.1 μM dexamethasone and after 7 days of culture 5 mM
β-glycerolphosphate was added. D-2-HG treatment,
with a concentration of 5 mM, was started since day 1.
Concentration was equivalent to the concentrations measured
in gliomas with an IDH1 mutation. [16, 18] Medium was
refreshed twice a week and after 3 weeks of culture, cells
were fixed for 10 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde and
stained with Oil-Red-O (adipocyte differentiation) or stained
with alizarin red (osteoblast differentiation).

(range, 420–720 nm) and thereby distinguish the purple
and blue staining. After subtracting the different colors,
percentages of collagen positive areas were determined
using the imageJ  software (U.S. National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed for histone
modifications (H3K4me3; Millipore, 07–473; H3K9me3,
Abcam, ab8898; H3K27me3, Millipore, 07–449),
DNA modifications (5-hydroxymethylcytosine and
5-methylcytosine) and collagen markers (collagen-II and
collagen-X). Details on antibodies and precedures are
shown in Supplementary Table 1.

Alkaline phosphatase assay

Bone development in zebrafish embryos

Medium was removed and cells were washed twice
with PBS. The cells were lysed in ALP lysis buffer (10 mM
glycine; 0.1 mM MgCl2; 0.01 mM ZnCl2; pH 10.5; 0.1%
Triton X-100) for 3 hours. The assay was performed
with 25 μl per sample with 2 μl of ALP substrate (6 mM
p-nitrophenylphosphate, PNPP) and 198 μl of ALP
assay buffer (100 mM glycine; 1.0 mM MgCl2; 0.1 mM
ZnCl2; pH 10.5). ALP activity was directly measured at
405 nm with a Victor3V, 1420 Multilabel plate reader
(Perkin Elmer, NL) for 120 minutes, with measurements
every 5 minutes. The slopes of the curves were compared
between controls and samples treated with 5 mM D-2-HG.

After fertilization (d = 0) embryos were positioned
on a 10 cm Petri dish coated with 1% agarose and injected
with 1 nl 0.8 M D-2-HG, L-2-HG or PBS during the
2–8  cell stages of development [41]. The compounds
were loaded into borosilicate glass capillary needles
(1.0 mm OD × 0.78 mm ID × 100 mm L; Harvard Apparatus)
and the injections were performed using a Pneumatic Pico
pump. Per experiment approximately 20 zebrafish embryos
per group were used. Experiments with PBS and D-2-HG
conditions were performed twice at different time points. At
8 days post fertilization (dpf) water was removed and 4%
paraformaldehyde was added to fix the zebrafish embryos.
Double staining with alizarin red and alcian blue was
performed as described elsewhere [42]. Alizarin Red positive
vertebrate rings were counted to quantify bone development.
To determine statistical significance an independent sample
t-test was performed using SPSS v20.

Chondrogenic differentiation
Cells were seeded in a 96-U-shaped-well plate at a
density of 200 000 cells per well and pellets were made
by centrifuging the plate at 1200 rpm for 7 minutes. Cells
were cultured in DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen), 1%
P/S, 1% glutamax, 40 μg/ml proline (Sigma-Aldrich),
100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg/ml
ITS+premix (Becton Dickinson), 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid,
0.1 μM dexamethasone, 10 ng/ml TGF-β3 (R&D
Systems) and 500 ng/ml BMP-6 (R&D Systems). D-2-HG
treatment was started since day 1. Cells were allowed to
differentiate for 4 weeks. After harvesting, the cells were
washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
covered by Cytoblock (Shandon Cytoblock, Thermo
Scientific, Etten- Leur, NL) and embedded in paraffin.
Subsequently, sections were cut, the middle of the
pellets was determined, and sections were mounted onto
APES-coated slides. Pellet morphology and matrix were
examined by hematoxylin and eosin as well as toluidine
blue staining. To quantify chondrogenic differentiation,
metachromasia, as a measure for the deposition of
glycosaminoglycans in the cartilaginous matrix, was
measured with the multispectral imaging system (Nuance
FX, Cambridge Research & Instrumentation, Inc [CRi],
Woburn, MA) on the microscope (Leica DM4000B). This
system enabled us to spectral unmix different wavelengths
