ABSTRACT
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), while uncommon worldwide, is a major health
problem in China. Although local radiation and surgery provide good control of NPC,
better treatments that permit reductions in radiation dosing are needed. Inhibition
of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a ubiquitous multifunctional enzyme with critical
roles in cell cycle regulation and DNA-damage response, reportedly sensitizes cancer
cells to radiation and chemotherapy. We studied PP2A inhibition with LB100, a small
molecule currently in a Phase I clinical trial, on radiosensitization of two human
nasopharyngeal cell lines: CNE1, which is reportedly radioresistant, and CNE2. In
both cell lines, LB100 exposure increased intracellular p-Plk1, TCTP, and Cdk1 and
decreased p53, changes associated with cell cycle arrest, mitotic catastrophe and
radio-inhibition of cell proliferation. Mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts of either
cell line were administered 1.5 mg/kg LB100 daily for three days and a single dose
of 20 Gy radiation (day 3), which produced marked and prolonged tumor mass
regression (dose enhancement factors of 2.98 and 2.27 for CNE1 and CNE2 xenografts,
respectively). Treatment with either LB100 or radiation alone only transiently inhibited
xenograft growth. Our results support further exploration of PP2A inhibition as part
of radiotherapy regimens for NPC and potentially other solid tumors.

INTRODUCTION

common outside China, with less than 1 case per 100,000
in most populations [3]. Standard treatment is comprised
of radiotherapy followed by surgical resection, resulting in
high rates of local control, exceeding 90% [4]. However,
improved treatments that in particular would allow for
reduced radiation dosing are needed to both achieve long
term control and reduce the high rates of radiation-induced

NPC is the most common cancer of
the nasopharynx, comprising 18 % of all cancers in China

temporal lobe necrosis often seen after radiation to the
nasopharyngeal region [4, 5].
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitous
and conserved serine/ threonine phosphatase that plays
a role in many human pathological conditions, notably
cancer [6, 7]. PP2A is a tumor suppressor and its function
can be reduced by inactivating mutations of structural
subunits or by up-regulation of cellular PP2A inhibitors
[8-11]. However, PPA2 is also a negative regulator of
cancer defense mechanisms activated in response to
DNA damage by chemotherapy agents and radiotherapy
[12]. Inhibition of PP2A has been reported to have antitumor activity against different human cancer cell types
[13-17]. Sensitization of cancer cells to radiation and
chemotherapy by PP2A inhibition is believed to occur via
several mechanisms including sustained phosphorylation
of p53, Akt, MDM2, Plk1, TCTP and Cdk1, which are
associated with apoptosis, cell cycle deregulation, and
inhibition of DNA repair [14, 18-22]. Thus, PP2A is a
potential target for sensitization of tumors to both drugs
and radiation [23].
LB100 is a water-soluble PP2A inhibitor currently
in a phase I clinical trial [24]. In animal models of
pheochromocytoma and sarcoma xenografts, LB100
treatment in combination with temozolomide or
doxorubicin has been shown to significantly induce
tumor regression without an apparent increase in
systemic toxicity compared to either drug alone [14,
25]. In addition, a homolog of LB100, LB1.2, has been

demonstrated to enhance the effectiveness of both
temozolomide and doxorubicin against glioblastoma
xenografts [13]. In the present study, we evaluated the
effects of ionizing radiation (IR) therapy on PP2A activity
and the ability of LB100 to enhance the therapeutic effects
of radiation of against models of NPC.

RESULTS
LB100 demonstrates dose-dependent inhibition of
NPC cells in vitro
CNE1 and CNE2 cells were exposed to different
concentrations (1−200 µM) of LB100 or vehicle for 72
hours. MTT assays were used to measure the inhibition
rates of cellular growth (Figure 1A, B). In vitro, LB100
showed little inhibitory activity at concentrations ≤ 5
µM but subsequently exhibited modest dose-dependent
inhibition of CNE1 and CNE2 cell growth at higher
concentrations. There were no significant differences in
rates of apoptosis between CNE1 cells and CNE2 cells.

LB100 exposure blocks radiation-induced
increases in PP2A activity in NPC cells in vitro
and in mouse xenograft models in vivo

and in CNE1 and CNE2 cell xenografts in vivo 6 hours
after 20 Gy radiation, with and without prior exposure to
LB100. Radiation in vitro was associated with increases
of 260% and 210% in PP2A activity in CNE1 and CNE2
cells, respectively (Figure 2A). Radiation of xenografts
in vivo was associated with increases in PP2A activity of
205% and 175% in CNE1 and CNE2 tumors, respectively
(Figure 2B).
Exposure of both cell types to 2.5 µM LB100 alone
for 3 hours reduced PP2A activity to 72% of control

PP2A has been shown to play a role in the ATM/
ATR mediated activation of the G2/M cell cycle
checkpoint, following radiation-induced DNA damage
[20, 26]. We measured PP2A activity in CNE1 and CNE2
cells 6 hours after exposure to 8 Gy radiation in vitro

values in CNE1 and CNE2 cells (Figure 2A). In both
cell line xenografts, intraperitoneal administration of a
single dose of LB100 at 1.5 mg/kg also modestly reduced
PP2A activity in both CNE1 and CNE2 xenograft tumors
to 77% of controls (Figure 2B). However, when CNE1
and CNE2 cells were exposed to LB100 for 3 hours prior
to 8 Gy radiation, the induction of PP2A was blocked,
evidenced by a reduction in PP2A activity to 91% and
83% of control cells at 6 hours in CNE1 and CNE2 cells,
respectively (Figure 2A). Similarly, when mice bearing
CNE1 and CNE2 xenografts were treated with 1.5 mg/
kg LB100 intraperitoneally for 3 hours prior to 20 Gy
radiation, PP2A activity measured 6 hours after radiation
was reduced to 87% and 81% of controls in CNE1 and
CNE2 xenografts, respectively (Figure 2B).

subcutaneous xenografts were 2.98 and 2.27, respectively.
The reportedly more radioresistant line, CNE1 [27,
28], was slightly more sensitive to enhancement of
radiosensitivity by LB100 (Table 2). Survival times were
significantly different between each treatment group and
the control groups (p<0.05 for vehicle vs. LB100 and
p<0.001 between all other groups; Figure 4G, H). The
combination of LB100 and radiation was well tolerated
and produced minimal (<10%) weight loss compared to
controls, and the addition of LB100 caused no greater
weight loss than radiation alone.
These data demonstrate a synergistic effect between
LB100 treatment and radiation, as evidenced by the
significant abrogation of tumor growth delay and xenograft
survival compared to radiation alone. As such, LB100 is a
potent radiosensitizer in vivo in a NPC xenograft model.

LB100 sensitizes NPC cells to the effects of
radiation in vitro
Radiosensitization of NPC cells was determined
via a clonogenic assay. CNE1 and CNE2 cells were
exposed to 2.5 µM LB100 for 3 hours, which yielded cell
survival fractions of 0.70 and 0.79, respectively. These
results are within appropriate degrees of drug cytotoxicity
for evaluation in combination with radiation. LB100
combined with radiation treatment strongly inhibited
colony formation indicating significant radiosensitization,
with dose enhancement factors (DEF) of 1.83 and 1.97 for
CNE1 and CNE2, respectively (Figure 3A, B).

LB100 radiosensitizes NPC xenografts
Mice bearing NPC subcutaneous xenografts were
randomized to four treatment groups: vehicle alone,
LB100 (1.5 mg/kg) alone, radiation (20 Gy) alone, and
LB100 plus radiation. LB100 plus radiation inhibited
CNE1 and CNE2 xenografts and prolonged survival
(measured in days to a tumor volume ≥ 3000 mm3 at which
point animals were euthanized) of the mice. The mean
tumor weights and volumes of mice treated with radiation
alone and with the combination of LB100 plus radiation
were significantly less than those treated with vehicle or
LB100 alone (Figure 4A-D). LB100 alone increased the
time required for tumor volume doubling from 6.0 and
6.8 days in vehicle-treated animals to 6.4 and 8.1 days
in CNE1 and CNE2 xenografts, respectively. Radiation
alone slowed the rate of doubling to 9.2 and 10.6 days
and decreased tumor weights to 61.7% and 65.2% of
vehicle-treated animals for CNE1 and CNE2 xenografts,
respectively. Lastly, LB100 in combination with radiation
slowed the rate of tumor volume doubling to 27.7 and
26.7 days, which was associated with decreases in tumor
weights of 87.6% and 88.0% relative to vehicle control in
CNE1 and CNE2 xenografts, respectively (p<0.01; Figure
4E, F; Table 1). The DEF of LB100 for CNE1 and CNE2

Radiosensitization induced by LB100 accumulates
NPC cells in G2/M phase

of 8 Gy and 2.5 µM LB100 produced significantly more
apoptosis in both cell lines compared to LB100 alone
(p=0.025) and to radiation alone (p=0.04) (Figure 6).

Twenty-four hours after exposure to 2.5 µM
LB100, CNE1 and CNE2 cells showed no significant
difference in the distribution of cells in G0/G1 phase
and S phase, compared to the control (Figure 5A).
However, cells treated with LB100 and 8 Gy had a
significantly higher proportion of cells in G2/M phase
than control cells (Figure 5A-D). These data suggest that
the radiosensitization induced by LB100 results from an
accumulation of cells in G2/M phase rather than from
drug-induced alterations in cell cycle distribution.

LB100 activates CDK1 and enhances mitotic
catastrophe in NPC cells
To explore the mechanisms responsible for LB100mediated radiosensitization, we assessed changes in
known PP2A substrates involved in the DNA damage
response by Western blots. We measured the effects of
LB100, radiation, and LB100 plus radiation on Plk1,
Akt, p53, MDM2 and their downstream effectors,
translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) and Cdk1
in vitro.
Exposure of CNE1 and CNE2 cells to LB100 for
6 hours resulted in the appearance of abnormal mitotic
figures characteristic of mitotic catastrophe, a form of cell
death distinct from apoptosis and cell senescence (Figure
8) [29, 30]. Induction of mitotic catastrophe by LB100 was

associated with increased levels of phosphorylated Plk1
(p-Plk1), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt1) and decreased
levels of TCTP (Figure 7). TCTP is an abundant, highly
conserved, multifunctional protein that binds to and
stabilizes microtubules before and after mitosis and also
exerts potent anti-apoptotic activity [31, 32]. Decreasing
TCTP with antisense TCTP has been shown by others
to enhance tumor reversion of v-src-transformed NIH
3T3 cells, and reduction of TCTP is suggested to be the
mechanism by which high concentrations of certain antihistamines and psychoactive drugs inhibit growth of a
human lymphoma cell line [33].
LB100 exposure also was associated with an
increase in phosphorylated MDM2 (p-MDM2), the
primary regulator of p53 activity [34, 35], and a decrease
in Ser15-phosphorylated p53 [p53(S15)] (Figure 7). An
increase in MDM2 impairs p53-mediated arrest of the cell
cycle allowing DNA replication and mitosis to proceed
despite induced DNA damage [36]. p-Akt1 can stabilize
MDM2 via phosphorylation and can also phosphorylate
MDMX, which binds to and further stabilizes MDM2
[37].
p-Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser-308 indicates
downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3kinase (PI3K) pathway, an event generally considered to
be cell growth promoting [38]. Akt1 activation, however,
may be anti- or pro-apoptotic depending on the context

of cell signaling [39]. In the case of LB100 inhibition of
PP2A, an increase in p-Akt1 activates Plk-1, a regulator
of a mitotic checkpoint and of the activity of TCTP and
Cdk1 [40, 41]. At the same time, increased p-Akt1 blocks
cell cycle arrest mediated by p53 in response to DNAdamage [42].
Additionally, we found that LB100 alone and in
combination with radiation were associated with an
increase in Cdk1 activity via phosphorylation of Plk1 (Thr210), ultimately resulting in persistent phosphorylation
of Cdk1 at Tyr-15 [p-Cdk1(Y15)] and G2/M phase entry
in response to DNA damage (Figure 7). Phosphorylation
of Cdk1, a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase, is
known to lead to cell cycle progression [43, 44].
Taken together, these data demonstrate a series of
molecular changes in response to inhibition of PP2A by
LB100, which likely result in blocking cell cycle arrest
and inducing mitotic catastrophe via activation of Cdk1
and inhibition of TCTP.

Effect of LB100 on repair of radiation-induced
DNA double-strand breaks

DNA damage and repair, we determined γ-H2AX
levels, a measure of DNA double-strand breaks, at 6

hours in CNE1 and CNE2 cells by immunoblotting
and immunofluorescence  [18, 19, 45]. 2.5 µM LB100
alone caused no significant change in γ-H2AX levels.
However, combined treatment with LB100 and radiation
(8 Gy) or radiation alone was associated with similarly
significant elevations in γ-H2AX expression in control
and drug-treated CNE1 and CNE2 cells (Figures 7 and 8).
Collectively, these data suggest that in NPC cells, LB100
interferes with cellular responses to DNA damage by
preventing repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand
breaks, ultimately leading to persistent DNA damage and
enhancement of radiation-induced cell killing.

In the present study, radiosensitization of CNE1
and CNE2 cells by LB100 resulted from blocking cell
cycle arrest and facilitating mitotic catastrophe rather
than from an increase in apoptosis. LB100 exposure was
associated with an increased percentage of cells in mitosis
after radiation treatment. There are several possible
explanations for this finding. One possibility is that PP2A
inhibition results in abrogation of the G2/M checkpoint,
allowing more cells to enter mitosis after radiation. An
alternative possibility is that PP2A inhibition prevents
cells from exiting mitosis. There is accumulating evidence
that PP2A activity in association with B55α and B55δ
regulatory phosphatase subunits is necessary for mitotic
exit in mammalian cells [49, 50].
PP2A gene knockdown and protein inhibition
by calyculin A are associated with ionizing radiationinduced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46 and subsequent
apoptosis in lymphocytes and Jurkat cells [22, 51, 52].
Our data indicate that in NPC cells inhibition of PP2A
by LB100 triggers a chain of alterations in cancer cell
signaling that accelerates inappropriate entry of cells into
mitosis and, at the same time, impairs arrest of cell cycle
at G1 and G2/M (Figure 9). In the face of radiotherapyinduced DNA damage and disordered cell replication,
LB100 up-regulates Akt1, which has the potential to
stimulate cell growth, and, at the same time, interferes
with p53-mediated cell cycle arrest by stabilizing MDM2
[39]. An increase in p-Akt1 activates Plk1, interfering
with the G2/M checkpoint [53, 54], up-regulates Cdk1
by dephosphorylation, and down-regulates TCTP by
phosphorylation [30].
We also found that p-Plk1 phosphorylation of
TCTP results in a marked reduction in TCTP abundance.

DISCUSSION
Our findings demonstrate that LB100, a small
molecule inhibitor of PP2A, enhances the radiosensitivity
of human NPC cells in vitro and in vivo. The potential
for PP2A inhibition as an effective strategy for
radiosensitization has been suggested previously [13, 20,
29, 46]. Earlier studies showed that the cyanobacterial
toxin microcystin-LR, a PP1 and PP2A inhibitor,
decreased repair of radiation-induced DNA damage
in lymphocytes [47, 48]. In comparison, our results
demonstrated higher DEF values when radiation was
administered in conjunction with LB100. Furthermore,
unlike previous studies involving LB100, we administered
radiation as a single high dose rather than multiple low
doses. Our data suggest a single potent dose of radiation
may work well with LB100. Alternatively this effect could
be also related to the biological entity of NPC or a unique
genetic background in these NPC lines.

PP2A activity assay

Phosphorylation of TCTP decreases the stabilization
of microtubules [31, 32], which may contribute to the
development of mitotic catastrophe after exposure of
cancer cells to LB100. Loss of TCTP expression during
embryogenesis increases cell death [55], presumably by
reduction of TCTP anti-apoptotic activity that is mediated
by interference with Bax dimerization in the mitochondrial
membrane [32]. Loss of TCTP induced by inhibition
of PP2A may enhance cancer cell killing by causing
persistent phosphorylation of γ-H2AX [18]. Our data show
that inhibition of PP2A by LB100 is associated with only
a slight increase in γ-H2AX levels. However, there was
significantly increased γ-H2AX expression at 6 hours after
radiation following LB100 suggesting that LB100 inhibits
the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage in CNE1 and
CNE2 cells. Extension of the in vitro data to an in vivo
model confirmed that LB100 inhibits PP2A and prevents
radiation-induced increases in PP2A activity whereas
LB100 alone causes only a minor delay in tumor growth.
Wei et al recently reported that inhibition of PP2A
sensitizes human pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro and in
vivo by inhibition of homologous recombination repair of
DNA and activation of Cdc25c/Cdk1 signaling, suggesting
that inhibition of PP2A is a potential target for enhancing
local therapy in pancreatic cancer [56]. Our results
indicate that LB100 is an effective and tolerable agent for
sensitizing NPC cells to radiation in mouse models and
provides additional support for preclinical exploration of
the radiosensitizing properties of LB100 and other PP2A
inhibitors. If the degree of radiosensitization seen in our
studies of NPC in animal models can be achieved in
humans without undue toxicities, the addition of LB100 to
radiotherapy may increase the efficacy and lower the costs
of NPC treatment. The results of a recently initiated Phase
I trial will be instructive in the safety and tolerability of
LB100 in humans.

At 80% confluence, cells were treated with LB100
(2.5 µM) or an equivalent volume of vehicle 3 hours prior
to 8 Gy or sham radiation. Cells were washed three times
in 0.9% saline. Tissue protein extraction reagent (T-PER)
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) was added. 300 µg
of cell lysate was assayed by Malachite Green Phosphatase
assay for serine/threonine phosphatase activity (Ser/Thr
phosphatase assay kit 1; Millipore, Billerica, MA). PP2A
activity in CNE1 and CNE2 xenografts was assayed in the
same conditions. In vivo LB100 dose was given at 1.5 mg/
kg intraperitoneally daily for 3 days and radiation, 20 Gy
at rate of 600 cGy/min, was given on day 3.

Clonogenic survival assay
Cell cultures were trypsinized to generate single-cell
suspensions and cells were seeded into 60mm dishes at
cloning densities in duplicate or triplicate. After 24 hours,
drug was added (2.5 µM, LB100). Cells were irradiated 3
hours later and the drug removed after 24 hours, followed
by incubation at 37°C for 10 days. Colonies were stained
with 0.2% crystal violet and the number of colonies
containing at least 50 cells was determined. The surviving
fractions were calculated and survival curves generated
using the linear-quadratic equation after normalizing for
cytotoxicity from LB100 treatment alone.

Cell cycle analysis
Evaluation of cell cycle was performed by flow
cytometry. Cells were exposed to LB100 (2.5µM)
for 3 hours prior to administration of 8 Gy or sham
radiation. Cells were trypsinized, fixed and stained per
manufacturer’s instructions with Cell Cycle Reagent, and
analyzed on an EasyCyte Plus flow cytometer (Guava
Technologies, Hayward, CA).

METERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and drug solutions

Apoptosis assay

Human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines CNE1
and CNE2 were obtained from Sun Yat-sen University
Cancer Center and grown in 1640 medium with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. CNE1
cells are reported to be more radioresistant than CNE2
cells [57, 58].
Cell cultures were maintained in an atmosphere of
5% CO2/95% air at 37°C and tested free of Mycoplasma
contamination. LB100, a water-soluble homolog of LB1.2
is a specific competitive small-molecule inhibitor of PP2A
[13, 24]. LB100 was provided by Lixte Biotechnology
Holdings Inc. (East Setauket, NY). It was stored at 1 mM
in normal saline at -80°C.

Apoptotic fraction was evaluated by flow cytometry
using the Guava Nexin assay (Guava Technologies,
Hayward, CA). Cells were exposed LB100 (2.5 µM) for
3 hours prior to administration of 8 Gy or sham radiation.
Cells were trypsinized and stained per manufacturer’s
instructions with Nexin Reagent to assess annexin-V
conjugated to phycoerythrin as a marker of cells in early
apoptosis and 7-AAD as an indicator of late apoptosis
(Guava Technologies). Analysis was performed on an
EasyCyte Plus flow cytometer.

randomized into untreated controls, LB100, irradiation,
and combination LB100 and irradiation. LB100 was
administered daily Monday to Wednesday for 3 days,
alone or in combination with radiation, at 1.5 mg/kg
intraperitoneally. Radiation was administered at 20 Gy
(600cGy/min) alone on day 3 or in combination 3 hours
after LB100 treatment on day 3. Animals were restrained
in lead jigs custom made by the Radiation Biology
Branch of the Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences. The growth of tumors (5
for each group) were measured five times per week and
average tumor volume (TV) was calculated according to
the equation: TV = (L× W2)/2, where L and W are the
longer and shorter dimensions of the tumor, respectively.
Animals were euthanized when tumors reached ≥ 3000
mm3. Survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method
with the day of injection assigned as day zero and a logrank test used to compare groups.

Immunofluorescent cytochemical staining for
γoH2AX foci was performed by exposing cells grown
on coverslips to LB100 (2.5 µM) for 3 hours prior to
administration of 8 Gy or sham radiation. Cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS,
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in saline, blocked
with 15% FBS in PBS, and incubated in blocking buffer
containing primary antibody against γ-H2AX (Millipore)
and then incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Nuclei were counterstained
with DAPI (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cover slips were
mounted with Beyotime anti-fade solution (Beyotime
institute, Jiangsu, China) and γ-H2AX foci were imaged
(40x objective) with a fluorescent microscope (BX51
Olympus microscope, Tokyo, Japan) and a EvolutionTM VF
camera (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD).

Ionizing Radiation

Immunoblotting

Ionizing radiation was carried out using a Varian600CD linear accelerator (Varian, USA) at a dose rate of
600cGy/minute in the Department of Radiation Oncology
of the Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences. Dosimetry was carried out using
an ionization chamber connected to an electrometer
system that is directly traceable to a National Institute
of Standards and Technology calibration. For tumor
irradiation, animals were anesthetized with sodium
pentobarbital and positioned such that the apex of each
flank tumor was at the center of a 2.4 cm aperture in the
secondary collimator, with the rest of the mouse shielded
from radiation. The tissue-equivalent compensator was a
1 cm thick wax plate.

Whole cell and homogenized tissue lysates were
prepared in cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150
mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.2% Triton X-100 and
0.3% NP-40) supplemented with phosphatase and protease
inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) as previously
described [59]. The protein concentration in each sample
was measured by a colorimetric assay (ProteinAssay
Kit; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Detection of
protein bound primary antibodies was performed with a
horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody
specific to rabbit Ig and an enhanced chemiluminescence
system. The following antibodies were used: PP2A, TCTP,
Plk1, phospho-Plk1 (Thr20), phospho-Cdk1 (Tyr15),
Cdk1 (Abcam, Cambridge, England), phospho-MDM2
(Ser166), phospho-Akt (Thr308), phospho-P53 (Ser15),
Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), γ-H2AX,
H2AX (Millipore), β-actin (Sigma).

Statistical analysis
In vitro studies were done in three independent
experiments and the data are presented as mean ± SE.
For in vivo tumor growth studies, log-rank tests were
conducted to compare tumor volume doubling/tripling
times between treatment arms. Time to tumor volume
doubling/tripling was defined as the earliest day on which
the tumor volume was at least twice/thrice as large as on
the first day of treatment. A two-sided Student’s t-test
was used to compare sample means with a p value of
<0.05 considered significant. All statistical analyses were
carried out using GraphPad Prism 4 (San Diego, CA) and
SigmaPlot software (Version 9.0, Systat Software Inc., San
Jose, CA).

Animal experiments
BALB/c nude mice at 6-8 weeks of age were
purchased from HFK Bio-technology Co. Ltd., Beijing,
China. Each mouse weighed approximately 20 grams (half
male and female). Animals were fed animal chow and
water ad libitum and maintained on a 12-hour light/12hour dark cycle. All animal experiments were carried
out according to a protocol approved by the University
Committee for Use and Care of Animals. Five million
CNE1 and CNE2 cells in a 1:1 mixture of 10% FBS1640 were injected subcutaneously into the right posterior
limbs of BALB/c nude mice. When average tumor volume
reached the size of approximately 120 mm3, the mice were
randomized and the treatment was initiated. Animals were
