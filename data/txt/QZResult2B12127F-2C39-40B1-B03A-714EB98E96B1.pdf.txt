ABSTRACT
We try to elucidate whether a carbon ion beam alone or in combination with
gemcitabine has advantages over X-ray in targeting putative pancreatic cancer stemlike cells (CSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Colony, spheroid formation and tumorigenicity
assays confirmed that CD44+/ESA+ cells sorted from PANC1 and PK45 cells have more
CSC properties than CD44-/ESA- cells. The number of colonies and spheroids formed
from CSCs after carbon ion beam irradiation was significantly reduced compared to
after X-ray irradiation, and they were extremely highly suppressed when carbon ion
beam combined with gemcitabine. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values
for the carbon ion beam relative to X-ray at the D10 levels for CSCs were 2.23-2.66.
Expressions of multiple cell death-related genes were remarkably highly induced, and
large numbers of γH2AX foci in CSCs were formed after carbon ion beam combined
with gemcitabine. The highly expressed CSC markers were significantly inhibited after
30 Gy of carbon ion beam and almost lost after 25 Gy carbon ion beam combined with
50 mg/kg gemcitabine. In conclusion, a carbon ion beam combined with gemcitabine
has superior potential to kill pancreatic CSCs via irreparable clustered DSB compared
to a carbon ion alone or X-rays combined with gemcitabine.

INTRODUCTION

rate still less than 5% [5, 6]. It has been reported that
chemotherapy combined with conventional radiotherapy
for locally advanced pancreatic cancer achieved about 1725% of 2 year overall survival [7-9]. However, even in
patients whose tumors initially are arrested or regressed
the tumor still regrows after treatment. Resistance to
chemo-radiotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure
in pancreatic cancer. Therefore, there is a strong need
for new therapeutic strategies targeting PDAC’s chemoradioresistant cells to elevate overall survival.
With increasing evidence supporting the existence

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC),
which constitutes more than 90% of pancreatic cancers
in humans, is the fourth most frequent cause of cancerrelated death world-wide [1, 2] and is characterized by
a high rate of metastasis with high resistance to chemoradiotherapy [3, 4]. In spite of great efforts to improve
medical and surgical care over the past decades, little
substantial progress has been made towards improving the
PDAC prognosis, with the average overall 5-year survival

of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), pancreatic CSC
populations have recently been identified based on cell
membrane marker CD44+/ ESA+ /CD24+ cells and CD133+
cells [10, 11]. CSCs represent a subpopulation of cells
distinguishable from the bulk of the tumor based on their
exclusive ability to drive tumorigenesis and metastasis
[12-15]. CSCs are also considered responsible for therapy
resistance and disease recurrence [16-18], and therefore
represent interesting targets for new and more effective
treatment strategies [19-22]. Thus, the development of
new potent CSCs targeting therapeutics is highly desirable.
The heavy ion medical accelerator in Chiba
(HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiologic Science
(NIRS) has treated more than 9000 patients with a variety
of radioresistant tumors such as chordoma, sarcoma,
and malignant melanoma, and has achieved promising
results to date [23-30]. Heavy ion radiotherapy has been
spotlighted not only in superior dose convergence but
also the high biological effectiveness and is one of the
minimally invasive treatments with the best quality of
life (QOL), because heavy ion irradiation like carbon ion
beams has several advantages compared to conventional
photon therapy, such as cell-cycle and oxygenationindependence, and irreparable complex DNA damage. This
is because the heavy ion beams have a well-defined range
and insignificant scatter in tissues with well-localized
energy deposition at the end of the beam path, called
the “spread out bragg peak (SOBP)”, a unique physical
characteristic of charged particle beams, and release
enormous energy at the end of their range [31-33]. A
phase I study to evaluate treatment of patients with locally
advanced pancreatic cancer by carbon ion radiotherapy has
been reported [34], and we have also achieved promising
results for preoperative PDACs by carbon ion beam
radiotherapy [35]. However, limitation of dose elevation
because of important organs very nearby pancreas is one
of most critical problem for carbon ion beam radiotherapy.
Therefore, we speculated that a carbon ion beam combined
with chemotherapy might allow the doses of irradiation to
be reduced while still having some advantagein destroying
PDAC. Several studies have reported that carbon ion
beam combined with chemotherapy showed a small
radiosensitizing effect, but this depends on the cell type
and drugs (gemcitabine, cisplatin, camptonthecin) [36, 37]
. Recently, our clinical trial showed that 58% of 2-year
local control and 54% of 2-year overall survival rates
without significant side effects were obtained by 45.655.2 GyE carbon ion radiotherapy combined with 1000
mg/m2 gemcitabine [38]. Based on the above reports in
connection with our recent new finding that a carbon ion
beam has a marked effect on colon as well as pancreatic
CSCs, which are resistant to photon beams [39, 40], in
the present study, we try to examine the effects of carbon
ion beam alone or in combination with gemcitabine
on putative pancreatic CSC survival, DNA repair, and
xenograft tumor control compared to X-ray irradiation. To
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore
whether a carbon ion beam combined with gemcitabine
has a superior effect on pancreatic CSCs at relatively low
doses compared to carbon ion beam alone or conventional
X-ray irradiation in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
Determination of cancer stem-like cell properties
of CD44+/ESA+ cells sorted from PNAC1 and
PK45
When equal numbers of 500 cells were plated in
a dish, CD44+/ESA+, cells from PNAC1, PK45 formed
55+ 3, 12 + 2 clones, whereas CD44+/ESA+ cells
formed only 19 + 3, 2 + 1 clones (p<0.01). These data
showed that CD44+/ESA+ pancreatic cancer cells had
much greater clonal formation capacities than those of
CD44-/ESA- cells (Figure 1A, B). After being in culture
in 96-well round-bottomed spheroid plates (Sumilon,
Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Tokyo. Japan) for 1 week,
CD44+/ESA+ formed spheroid bodies (Figure 1A, B).
The ability to form spheroid bodies in CD44+/ESA+ cells
was significantly higher than in CD44-/ESA-S (p<0.01).
Aliquots of 500 CD44+/ESA+ cells isolated from PK45,
PNAC1 were transplanted subcutaneously into the right
lower thigh of immunodeficient SCID mice and 5 x 103
CD44-/ESA- cells were transplanted subcutaneously into
the left lower thigh (Figure 1C). As shown in Table 1, only
50 cells of triple positive CD44+/ESA+/CD24+ cells could
form a tumor whereas 1 x 104 CD44- /ESA- /CD24- cells
could not (Figure 1C). Collectively, our data suggested
that CD44+/ESA+/CD24+, CD44+/ESA+ cells isolated
from PK45, PNAC1 cells present the characteristics of
CSCs. Because we need a much greater number of CSC
cells with the sorting system for survival colony analysis
and spheroid as well as γH2AX immunofluorescence
analysis, we mainly used CD44+/ESA+ cells as CSCs
in this experiment. We also confirmed that both CD44-/
ESA- cells are non-CSCs, and based on the same reasons
as mentioned above, we selected CD44-/ESA- cells as
non-CSC in the present analyses. We also confirmed that
CD44+/CD24+ cells sorted from MIA PaCa-2 and BxPc-3
have CSC properties [40].

Changes in proportion of CD44+/ESA+ cells after
carbon-ion beam alone or in combination with
gemcitabine
In PK45, PNAC1 cells, changes in the percentages
of CD44+, ESA+ cells 72 h or 96 h after X-ray or carbon
ion irradiation were investigated. The percentage of
CD44+, ESA+ cells in unirradiated PANC1 cells was

these survival curves, the RBE values calculated by the
D10, which is determined as the dose (Gy) required to
reduce the surviving fraction to 10%, relative to X-rays,
is about 1.85 to 2.10 for carbon-ion beams (Figure 3A).
Based on these survival curves, the RBE values calculated
at the D10 level for CSCs were calculated to be about 2.43
to 2.48, whereas RBE values for non-CSCs were about
1.94. The results show that the surviving fractions for
CD44+/ESA+ cells are significantly higher than CD44-/
ESA- cells after irradiation with either X-rays or carbon
ion beams (Figure 3B), suggesting that CSCs showed
resistance to both X-rays and carbon ions. RBE values for
unsorted and sorted CSCs and non-CSCs of carbon ion
beams relative to X-rays are summarized in Table 2.

about 4.7%, 0.9%, and it dose-dependently increased
more than 2-5 fold after X-ray irradiation, but only
around 2 folds by carbon ion beam alone at which the
doses induced equivalent effects by X-ray (Figure 2A).
However, the percentage of CD44+ and ESA+ cells
was extremely highly increased by more than 5-10 fold
when X-ray or carbon ion beam were combined with 10
nM of gemcitabine. Gemcitabine alone treatment also
significantly increased the percentage of CD44+ and
ESA+ cells (Figure 2A). The proportion of double positive
CD44+/ESA+ cells in PK45 cells after X-ray, carbon ion
beam alone or in combination with gemcitabine showed
the same tendency (Figure 2B).

further remarkably reduced when carbon ion beam was
combined with gemcitabine (Figure 3C, 3D). The spheroid
size of cancer stem like CD44+/ESA+ cells delivered
from PANC1 (Figure 3C) and PK45 cells (Figure 3D)
was significantly reduced by carbon ion beam-alone, or
gemcitabine-alone treatment but not by X-ray irradiation
alone, and it was extremely heavily decreased after
gemcitabine combined with either X-ray or carbon

after X-ray combined with gemcitabine. In comparison,
spheroid formation could not form when carbon ion beam
combined with gemcitabine. No spheres were formed
in non-CSCs with or without X-ray, carbon ion beam,

ion and X-ray alone or X-ray combined with gemcitabine
(Figure 4E). Gemcitabine-alone treatment simultaneously
remarkably increased the expression of cyclin D1, p21
and p16. Interestingly, expressions of DNA damage and
repair-related genes such as ARTEMIS, Rad51, TP53BP1,
BRAC1 were significantly enhanced after carbon ion beam
combined with gemcitabine compared to carbon ion beam
alone, X-ray alone or X-ray combined with gemcitabine
(Figure 4F). Expressions of cancer stemness-related genes
such as Sox-2, and Nanog-1 but not Oct-4, were showed
decreasing trend by carbon ion beam combined with
gemcitabine compared to that of carbon ion beam, X-ray
alone or X-ray combined with gemcitabine (Figure 4G).
However, expressions of angiogenesis-related genes such
as HIF1α, VEGF and tumor invasion-related genes like
MMP2, MMP9, E-cadherin and β-catenin were increased
by either carbon ion beam or X-ray irradiation alone and/
or in combination with gemcitabine compared to (Figure
4H).

gemcitabine. Figure 4C shows a clustergram of Custom

Bax, cytochrome c and Bcl2, as well as autophagy-related

elevated by carbon ion beam combined with gemcitabine
or gemcitabine alone compared to carbon ion beam, X-ray
alone or X-ray combined with gemcitabine (Figure 4D).
In addition, expression of senescence-related genes such
as p21, p16 and p27 was remarkably increased by carbon

A high number of γH2AX foci formed at 1 h after
X-ray or carbon ion irradiation both in CD44+/ESA+ and
CD44-/ESA- cells which had been sorted from PK45.
However, at 24 h after carbon ion irradiation, the induced
γH2AX foci level remained significantly higher than that
of X-ray irradiated cells with isoeffective dosages (Figure
5A). Furthermore, not only a great increase in the number
but also in the size of foci (clustered DSB) was frequently
found in carbon ion beam combined with gemcitabinetreated cells (Figure 5A, B). Interestingly, the big-sized
γH2AX foci were observed more frequently in CD44+/
ESA+ cells than in CD44-/ESA-- cells. In addition, the
number of γH2AX foci formed in CD44+/ESA+ cells
decreased more significantly than in CD44-/ESA- cells

after 12 weeks without any regrowth and relapse. To
determine the possibility of tumor growth control by
carbon-ion or X-ray in combination with gemcitabine,
the xenograft tumors were also treated with carbon ion 25
Gy or X-ray 35 Gy combined with 50 mg/kg gemcitabine
ip. Carbon-ion irradiation with 25 Gy in combination
with gemcitabine can suppress tumor growth without regrowth after 7-8 weeks. As expected, treatment with 35 Gy
X-ray in combination with gemcitabine failed to control
tumor growth. Xenotransplanted tumor control possibility
by carbon-ion and X-ray alone or in combination with

after X-ray irradiation (Figure 5 A, B). The same results
were also obtained in CD44+/ESA+ and CD44-/ESAcells which had been sorted from PANC1 (data not
shown).

Tumor growth control by carbon-ion beam alone

Transplanted PK45 xenograft tumors grow fast
without any treatment and the tumor volume became
more than 480 mm3 after being subcutaneously implanted
in the mice for 1-month. Treatment with X-ray (30 Gy)
effectively suppressed tumor growth and reduced the
tumor size and volume by about 10%, but the tumor
rapidly re-grew after 4 weeks and to double in volume
after another month. In contrast, treatment with carbon-ion
(30 Gy) radiation dramatically dereased tumor size and
volume by a factor of 2 in the first week and then gradually
decreased. The tumor was reduced to the same size before
radiation after one month and actually became less than

clearly shown that most of the tumor cells were destroyed
after being irradiated with a 35 Gy carbon-ion beam alone
or a 25 Gy carbon ion beam combined with 50 mg/kg
gemcitabine (Figure 6A).

carbon ion beam alone or carbon ion beam with relatively
lower doses combined with gemcitabine can more
effectively destroy CSCs compared to that a high dose of
X-rays, alone or combined with gemcitabine (Figure 6B).

DISCUSSION

In vivo changes of expression of CD44 and ESA
after carbon-ion beam alone or in combination
with gemcitabine

We found that in vitro RBE values for PNAC1 and
PK45 cells after carbon ion beam at the center of SOBP
(average LET is around 50-keV/µm) relative to the X-rays
are about 1.71 to 2.18 when calculated by the D10 levels.
RBE values are various dependent on LET as well as cell
types , and our results from this study are almost in line
with our previously reported other pancreatic cell lines
[40] and also place within other reported literatures using
50-80 keV/µm carbon ion beams on several human cancer
cells [42]. It has been demonstrated that various cancer
stem cell markers exist according to the tumor types, and
CD133 is not always expressed as a CSC marker [43]. In
the present study, we did not detect CD133 in both PNAC1

Immunofluorescence analysis showed that 30 Gy of
carbon-ion beam predominantly suppressed expression of
both CD44 and ESA. In comparison, even 60Gy X-rays
did not reduced expression of CD44 and ESA (Figure
6B). The CD44 and ESA expression was almost lost by
25 Gy of carbon-ion beam in combination with 50 mg/
kg of gemcitabine, whereas these CSC markers were
still expressed by 35 Gy of X-rays in combination with
gemcitabine. This finding suggests that high doses of

with apoptosis and autophagy [36, 44-47]. Gemcitabine
has also been shown to induce senescence in pancreatic
cancer cells [48]. In the present study, we firstly found
that after treatment with carbon ion beam in combination
with gemcitabine for PK45 cells, not only apoptosisrelated gene expressions such as Bax, cytochrome c
and Bcl2 but also autophagy-related genes such as
LC3, p62 as well as senescence-related genes such
as p21, p16 were significantly elevated compared to
carbon ion beam alone, X-ray alone or X-ray combined
with gemcitabine, suggesting that carbon ion beam
combined with chemotherapy may have more power
to induce multiple cell death. Gemcitabine alone also
induced multi cell death related gene expressions,
but simultaneously significantly enhanced expression
of cyclin D1 oncogene. Embryonic stem cell factors
have shown to be closely related with cancer stemness
and also associated with radioresistance [49, 50].
Interestingly, strong downregulation of expressions of the
reprogramming factors such as Sox-2, Nanog-1 but not
Oct-4 were found after carbon ion beam combined with
gemcitabine compared to that of carbon ion and X-ray
alone or X-ray combined with gemcitabine, indicating
that carbon ion beam combined with chemotherapy may
have more potential to regress pancreatic cancer cell
stemness. Expressions of DNA damage and repair-related
genes such as ARTEMIS, Rad51, TP53BP1, BRAC1 were
significantly enhanced after carbon ion beam combined
with gemcitabine compared to carbon ion beam, X-ray
alone or X-ray combined with gemcitabine, suggesting
that carbon ion beam combined with chemotherapy may
do more DNA damage to the cancer cells as a results
activated homologous recombination pathway [51].
However, expressions of angiogenesis-related genes
such as HIF1α, VEGF, CD34 and tumor invasion-related
genes like MMP2, MMP9, E-cadherin and β-catenin were
increased by either carbon ion beam or X-ray combined
with gemcitabine compared to carbon ion beam or X-ray
irradiation alone, implying that either high or low LET
radiation may enhance tumor angiogenesis and/or invasion
when combined with chemotherapy [52]. In accordance
with previous reports [53], in the present study, the number
of γH2AX foci formed in CSCs was significantly reduced
after X-ray irradiation compared to that of non-CSCs, and
not only the number but also the size of foci after carbon
ion beam were significantly higher compared to that of
X-ray irradiation, indicating that although CSC have
more capacity to repair X-ray induced DSB, high LET
carbon ion beam induced more complex DSB which is
not easily repairable [40, 54, 55]. It has been reported that
gemcitabine impairs cancer cells from repairing radiationinduced DNA damage by reducing the availability of
normal nucleotides accompanied with elevation of
residual γH2AX [46], and in this study, a larger number
as well as larger-sized γH2AX foci formed when carbon
ion beam combined with gemcitabine compared to that of

and PK45 cells, this is the same as the case of MIA PaCa-2
and BxPc-3 cells. We found that CD44+/ESA+, CD44+/
CD24+ cells have a significantly higher possibility for
colony and tumor sphere formation than CD44-/ESAand CD44-/CD24- cells. The in vivo tumorigenicity study
showed that the tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer cells
is much higher than CD44-/ESA- and CD44-/CD24- cells.
As expected, triple positive CD44+/ESA+/CD24+ cells
have superior CSC properties compared to those of double
positive CD44+/ESA+ or CD44+/CD24+ cells.
In the present study, FACS analyses showed that the
proportion of cancer stem-like CD44+/ESA+ cells was
more highly enriched after X-rays compared to carbon
ion irradiation. However, either X-ray or carbon ion beam
combined with gemcitabine significantly increased CSC
proportion. The percentages of cancer stem cell-like
CD44+/ESA+ cells increased markedly by 5-10-fold after
X-ray irradiation, whereas the proportion of these cells
only doubled or decreased after carbon ion irradiation. It
is suggested that cancer stem cell-like CD44+/ESA+ cells
may be resistant to X-rays resulting in selective killing
of non-cancer stem cell-like CD44-/ESA- cells, leading
to an increase in the relative proportion of CSCs, whereas
carbon ion irradiation may kill both cancer and nonCSCs at the same time, with relatively small changes in
the proportion of CSCs in the population. This finding is
consistent with our and other previous reports [39, 40].
To directly determine the radiosensitivity of pancreatic
cancer stem-like CD44+/ESA+ cells for carbon ion
beam, or X-ray irradiation, alone or in combination with
gemcitabine, a colony assay was performed. Based on
dose-response curves for cell-killing effect on CSCs and
non-CSCs after irradiation with either X-rays or carbon
ion beams, the CSCs showed resistance to both X-rays
and carbon ions compared to non-CSCs. However, CSCs
were significantly radiosensitized when carbon ion beam
was combined with gemcitabine. In addition, spheroid
formation abilities were predominantly reduced by carbon
ion beam combined with gemcitabine compared to that of
X-ray combined with gemcitabine.
The surviving fractions for the cancer stem like cells
after irradiation with X-rays or carbon ions decreased
exponentially with increasing doses. The RBE values
calculated at the D10 level for CSCs delivered from
PK45, PNAC1 were about 2.23 to 2.66, suggesting that
the carbon ion beam has a promising potential to destroy
CSCs. In contrast, RBE values at the D10 level for nonCSCs delivered from PK45, PNAC1 were only 1.94,
implying that the difference in killing pancreatic cancer
cells between carbon ion beam and X-ray irradiation might
mainly result from the strong effects on CSCs. Taken
together, these results may explain why the proportion of
CSCs after irradiation with X-rays is more enriched than
carbon ion beams.
It has been demonstrated that gemcitabine

X-rays alone, carbon ion beam alone or X-ray combined
with gemcitabine. This finding could explain why a high
LET carbon ion beam combined with chemotherapy has
more potential to induce unrepairable complex cluster
DSB. Taken together, our results are the first to show that
predominant effects of carbon ion beam in combination
with gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer cell killing mainly
result from efficient eradication of CSCs rather than nonCSCs.
To determine the tumor growth control possibility
by carbon ion beam in combination with gemcitabine,
the xenograft tumors were also treated with carbon ion
25 Gy or X-ray 35 Gy alone or combined with 50 mg/
kg gemcitabine ip. Carbon ion beam with 25 Gy in
combination with gemcitabine can suppress tumor growth
without re-growth after 7-8 weeks. This is consistent with
our recent clinical trial with 58% of 2-year local control
and 54% of 2-year overall survival by high LET carbon
ion radiotherapy combined with gemcitabine, which is an
almost 2 times better results compared to low LET photon
radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy [6-8, 38]. As
expected, treatment with 35 Gy X-ray in combination
with gemcitabine failed to control tumor growth.
Histopathological features showed that most of tumor
cells did not disrupt by 30 Gy X-rays or 15 Gy carbon ion
beam, but the tumor cells were partially destroyed by 25
Gy carbon ion beam. It is very clearly shown that most of
the tumor cells were destroyed after irradiated with 35 Gy
carbon-ion alone or 25 Gy carbon ion in combination with
50 mg/kg gemcitabine without significant side effects.
The CD44 and ESA expression was slightly decreased
with carbon ion beam at dose of 15 Gy, but significantly
suppressed by either by 35 Gy of carbon ion beam alone
or 25 Gy carbon ion beam combined with 50 mg/kg
gemcitabine. In comparison, the expression of CD44 and
ESA was increased by X-rays at a dose of 35 Gy, and still
remained even combined with 50 mg/kg gemcitabine. This
finding suggests that a high dose of carbon ion beam alone
or relatively low dose of carbon ion beam combined with
chemotherapy can effectively eradicate CSCs.
For the last several decades, conventional
radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy has improved
many cancer types such as bladder, gastric and rectal
cancer treatment dramatically[56-58], and the mechanisms
behind the synergistic effect of combing radiation and
chemotherapy have been well documented [43, 59, 60].
During the past 20 years, carbon ion radiotherapy alone
has been successful in treating many radiorsistant and
recurrent refractory human cancers with a high local
control rate, equal or better outcome compared to surgery
and established minimally invasive, short-term and
highest QOL treatment [23, 24, 26, 28, 30-32]. However,
to not only further improve local control rate but also
give systemic treatment to improve distant recurrencefree survival (DRFS) and thus disease-specific survival
(DSS) for some advanced cancers for which it is difficult
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to elevate the radiation doses, combining chemotherapy
with carbon ion beam is also highly desirable.
In summary, carbon ion beam combined with
gemcitabine synergistically enhanced pancreatic CSCs
death via inhibition of DNA repair as well as e irreparable
complex DNA damage, increasing apoptosis and
autophagy, and inhibition of cell proliferation at relatively
low doses compared to carbon ion beams alone. Taken
together, our findings show the potential benefits of carbon
ion beams in combination with chemotherapy in targeting
conventional radioresistant locally advanced pancreatic
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines PK45, PNAC1,
MIA PaCa-2 and BxPc-3 were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Unsorted cells
were cultured in Royal Park Memorial Institute(RPMI)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(Beit-HaEmek, Israel),100 unit/mL penicillin and 100μg/
mL streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37°C with 5% CO2-inair. The medium was changed every other day. CSCs and
non-CSCs isolated from PK45, PNAC1, MIAPaCa-2 and
BxPc-3 cells were cultured with serum-free Essential
8 medium (Life technologies Japan Ltd, Tokyo).
Gemcitabine was purchased from Eli Lilly Japan. The
gemcitabine solutions were diluted in PBS immediately
before use.

Colony and spheroid formation assays
Clonogenic survival assay was performed as
described previously [39]. In brief, the appropriate
plating density was aimed at producing 20–40 surviving
colonies in each T-25 flask. After incubation for 14
days, the colonies were fixed and stained with 0.3%
methylene blue in ethanol, and colonies containing more
than 50 cells were counted as survivor. At least three
parallel samples were scored in three to five repetitions
performed for each irradiation condition. Clonogenicity
and spheroid formation ability assays for CD44+/ESA+,
CD44+/CD24+ and CD44-/ESA-, CD44-/CD24- cells
sorted from PK45, PNAC1, MIAPaCa-2 and BxPc-3 cells
plated in triplicate in a 6-cm dish or a 96 well spheroid
formation plate (Sumilon, Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan) were performed as described previously
[40]. The data is presented as percentage of the wells that
contained spheres. and the average size using WinRoof 5.6
software (Mitani Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) after 1-week

prepared with the RT2 First Strand Kit (SABiosciences,
Frederick, Maryland, USA). A PCR profiler array specific
for 48 x 2 OSRGs was performed (RT2 SYBR Green/ROX
qPCR Master Mix; SABiosciences) in 96-well microtiter
plates on an ABI 7300 instrument (Applied Biosystems,
California, USA). For data analysis, the ΔΔCt method
was applied using the RT2 Profiler PCR Array software
package was used and statistical analyses performed
(n = 3). This package uses ΔΔ CT–based fold change
calculations and the Student’s t-test to calculate two-tail,
equal variance p-values. The fold change from PK45 cells
was calculated as 2−ΔΔCt. If the fold change was greater
than 1, the result was considered as fold-upregulation. If
the fold change was less than 1, the negative inverse of the
result was considered as fold-downregulation [41].

NOD/SCID mice (6-8 weeks old, Charles River
Laboratories, Yokohama, Japan) were maintained
under defined conditions at the NIRS animal facility.
The animals were observed for at least 12 weeks, and
tumorigenicity was determined when tumor nodules were
identified on their body surfaces. Tumor formation assays
for CD44+/ESA+, CD44+/CD24+ and CD44-/ESA-,
CD44-/CD24- cells were also performed as described
previously [40]. For the xenograft tumor control study,
NOD-SCID mice were subcutaneously injected with a 50
μl solution containing 1 x 106 viable PK45 cells into the
right thigh. Mice bearing 8-10 mm tumors were injected
ip with gemcitabine (50 mg/kg) alone once a week (day 1,
8, 15, etc) or at times after a single fraction of carbon ion
beam with 25 Gy or X-ray with 35 Gy for 3 weeks. All
experiments involving the use of animals were performed
in accordance with NIRS institutional animal welfare
guidelines.

γH2AX immunofluorescence assay
Immunofluorescence staining of phosphoHistone H2AX (Ser139) (γH2AX) was performed as
previously [40]. In brief, cultured cells grown on plastic
chamber slides (Lab-Tek. Nunc, USA) were fixed in 4%
formaldehyde, then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100
and blocked with 10% goat serum, incubated with mouse
monoclonal anti-γH2AX for at 37°C in PBS with 10% goat
serum and washed with PBS. The cells were incubated
with the Alexa 488 anti rabbit secondary antibody at
37°C in PBS with 10% goat serum and washed in PBS.
Cover glasses were mounted in ProLong® Gold antifade
reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images
were captured using an Olympus DP70 fluorescence
microscope for analysis. A minimum of 100 cells in each
treatment group were counted. Nuclear γH2AX foci size
was estimated by ImageJ 1.45 software (NIH).

Irradiation
Cells were irradiated with carbon-ion beams
(accelerated by the HIMAC). Briefly, the initial energy
of the carbon-ion beams was 290 MeV/n, center of 6 cm
Spread-Out Bragg Peak (SOBP) with average LET 50
keV/µm. As a reference, cells were also irradiated with
conventional 200 kVp X-ray (TITAN, GE Co.,USA).

FACS analysis
FACS analysis for the cells irradiated with X-rays
or carbon ion beams was performed with BD FACS Aria
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) as described
previously [39, 40]. In brief, the cells were prepared and
labeled with conjugated anti-human CD44-PE (Miltenyi
Biotec), ESA-APC (Miltenyi Biotec), and CD24-FITC.
Isotype matched immunoglobulin served as control.
Cells were incubated for 20 min at each step and were
washed with 2% FCS/PBS between steps. The percentage
of CD44+, ESA+, and CD24+ present was assessed after
correction for the percentage of cells reactive with an
isotype control.

Gross morphology and histopathology
Gross morphological changes were followed up to
12 weeks after a single fraction of X-ray, carbon-ion beam
alone or in combination with gemcitabine. At selected
time points, tumors were excised and histopathological
examinations were performed. Xenograft tumors from
different groups were fixed in 10% neutral formalin and
embedded in paraffin followed by sectioning (4 µm) onto
slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(HE) and assessed microscopically.
