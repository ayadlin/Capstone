Abstract
Trastuzumab antitumor activity in ErbB2-overexpressing
breast cancers seems to be dependent upon the presence of
phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome
10 (PTEN), a phosphatase that dampens phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase-Akt signaling. Consequently, PTEN deficiency, which
occurs in 50% of breast cancers, predicts for resistance to
trastuzumab monotherapy. Here, we show that lapatinib, a
small-molecule inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases,
exerts its antitumor activity in a PTEN-independent manner.
Steady-state phosphorylated ErbB2 (p-ErbB2) and p-Akt
(S473) protein levels were inhibited within 30 min following
lapatinib but not in response to trastuzumab in BT474 and
Au565 cells (two ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines
that are sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of lapatinib).
Whereas trastuzumab reportedly inhibits SRC phosphorylation (Y416), which in turn reduced SRC-ErbB2 protein
interactions, lapatinib had no effect on either variable. To
assess the potential functional role that PTEN might play in
lapatinib antitumor activity, we selectively knocked down
PTEN in BT474 and Au565 cells using small interfering RNA
transfection. Loss of PTEN did not affect induction of tumor
cell apoptosis by lapatinib in either cell line. In addition,
lapatinib inhibited Akt phosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 cells,
an ErbB1-expressing/ErbB2 non-overexpressing breast cancer
line, despite their PTEN-null status. Moreover, patients with
ErbB2-overexpressing inflammatory breast cancers responded
to lapatinib monotherapy regardless of PTEN status. Thus,
lapatinib seems to exert its antitumor activity in ErbB2overexpressing breast cancers in a PTEN-independent manner. These data emphasize the importance of assessing PTEN
status in tumors when selecting ErbB2-targeted therapies in
patients with breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1170–5]

Introduction
Deregulation of ErbB2 through protein overexpression or gene
amplification occurs in 20% to 30% of breast cancer patients, where
it predicts for a poor clinical outcome (1, 2). Consequently, ErbB2 is
an attractive target for therapeutic drug development (3, 4).
Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized anti-ErbB2 monoclonal

antibody, is approved for treating patients with ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers (5). However, the majority of eligible patients
still do not respond to trastuzumab monotherapy. In this regard,
trastuzumab antitumor activity in ErbB2-overexpressing breast
cancers seems to be dependent upon phosphatase and tensin
homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a phosphatase that
dephosphorylates and inactivates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5 trisphosphate, a lipid second messenger that recruits the serine/
threonine kinase Akt to the cell membrane where Akt is then
phosphorylated and activated (6–10). Phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) in
turn promotes tumor cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis.
PTEN is therefore considered a tumor suppressor by virtue of its
ability to dampen phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling (6–9). Loss of PTEN in tumors through mutation, haploinsufficiency, and loss of heterozygosity, or epigenetic silencing (e.g.,
promoter hypermethylation) occurs frequently in a variety of
tumors, including 50% of breast cancers (11–14). In an attempt to
elucidate factors predictive of response to trastuzumab, Nagata
et al. identified PTEN deficiency as a factor contributing to
trastuzumab resistance in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell
lines and primary tumors (10). The mechanism by which PTEN
facilitates trastuzumab antitumor activity reportedly involves the
inhibition of SRC phosphorylation and activation, resulting in the
disruption of ErbB2-SRC protein interactions, in turn activating
PTEN phosphatase activity, leading to Akt inhibition and suppression of tumor cell proliferation and survival signals.
ErbB2 has also been targeted through small-molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitors that compete with ATP for binding to the ErbB2
catalytic kinase domain. Lapatinib is a reversible inhibitor of ErbB2
and ErbB1 tyrosine kinases (15), currently in phase III clinical
trials. Inhibition of ErbB2 tyrosine autophosphorylation by
lapatinib blocks downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MAPK-Erk1/2) and
PI3K-Akt signaling in tumor cell lines, xenografts, and patients,
particularly those with ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers
(16–19).
Lapatinib elicits antitumor activity in preclinical models of
trastuzumab resistance and in patients whose breast cancers have
progressed on trastuzumab therapy (19, 20). Because lapatinib and
trastuzumab have non–cross-resistant mechanisms of action (19),
we sought to determine whether PTEN deficiency affects lapatinib
antitumor activity in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers. Here,
we show that lapatinib differs in its effects on ErbB2 phosphorylation and ErbB2-SRC protein interactions compared with
trastuzumab. Importantly, loss of PTEN protein expression did
not affect lapatinib-induced apoptosis in ErbB2-overexpressing
breast cancer cell lines, nor was PTEN deficiency associated with

resistance to lapatinib monotherapy in patients with ErbB2overexpressing breast cancers. These findings provide a rationale
for selecting ErbB2-targeted therapies based on a molecular
characterization of tumors that includes PTEN status to guide
therapeutic options in breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. BT474, Au565, and MDA-MB-468 breast
cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and L-glutamine from Life Technologies (Carlsbad,
CA) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37jC. IRDye 800–conjugated
affinity-purified anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG were from Rockland
(Gilbertsville, PA). Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from
Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antibodies to SRC and p-SRC (Y416) were
from Biosource (Camarillo, CA) and Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly,
MA), respectively. Anti-human survivin antibody was from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN). p-tyrosine antibody was purchased from Sigma
Chemical (St. Louis, MO). ErbB2 (Ab-11) antibody was from Neomarkers
(Union City, CA). p-Akt (Ser437), Akt1/2, p-Erk1/2, and Erk1/2 antibodies
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PTEN
antibody (sc-7974) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat
anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugates were
from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). SuperSignal
West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate was from Pierce (Rockford, IL).
Lapatinib (GW572016), N-{3-chloro-4-[(3-fluorobenzyl)oxy]phenyl}-6-[5({[2(methylsulfonyl)ethyl]amino}methyl)-2-furyl]-4-quinazolinamine, was
synthesized as previously described (15). Lapatinib for cell culture work
was dissolved in DMSO.
SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Whole-cell extracts were
prepared by scraping cells off Petri dishes, washing cell pellets 2 in
PBS, and then resuspending pellets in two-packed-cell volumes of
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 5 mmol/L sodium
orthovanadate, 2 mmol/L sodium fluoride, and a protease inhibitor
cocktail]. Protein concentrations were determined using a modification of
the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Labs, Hercules, CA). ErbB2-SRC complexes
were immunoprecipitated from 200 Ag of total cell lysate using an antiErbB2 antibody and protein A-Sepharose as previously described (18). For
Western blot analysis, equal amounts of proteins (50 Ag) were resolved by
either 7.5% or 4% to 15% gradient SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.
Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P or nitrocellulose membranes. Efficiency and equal loading of proteins was evaluated by Ponceau
S staining. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBS [25 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl] containing 4% (w/v) low-fat
milk or 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v). Membranes were then probed with
specific antibodies recognizing target proteins and visualized using ECL or
SuperSignal West Femto Maximum sensitivity substrate kit (Pierce).
Alternatively, membranes were probed with specific antibodies recognizing
target proteins or IRDye 800–conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG or Alexa
Fluor 680 anti-rabbit IgG, and proteins were visualized using the Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE).
Cell transfection with small interfering RNA constructs. Cell
transfections were done in a 12-well format using 2 AL LipofectAMINE
2000 (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in Opti-MEM I
(Invitrogen/Life Technologies) at 1.8  105 per well for BT474 and 1.6 
105 per well for Au565. SMART pools [containing four individual small
interfering RNA (siRNA) motifs] against PTEN and siControl non-targeting
pool were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The
concentration of siRNA was 100 nmol/L in a final volume of 1.1 mL
according to Invitrogen’s transfection protocol. After 16 to 18 h, the
transfection medium was removed and replaced with complete RPMI 1640.
Flow cytometry. For each sample, the culture medium was collected,
and the monolayer was washed in PBS-calcium magnesium-free (PBSCMF). Samples were then trypsinized and collected. Cells were pelleted at
200  g, aspirated and fixed in 70% methanol, and stored at 20jC until

www.aacrjournals.org

ready for analysis. The samples were pelleted at 200  g, aspirated and then
rinsed in 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 4% FCS, 0.1%
sodium azide and re-pelleted. The samples were re-pelleted, aspirated, and
resuspended in PBS-CMF/0.1% Triton X-100, 100 Ag/mL RNase A (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), and 40 mg/mL propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) for
analysis. DNA content was analyzed using a FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA) flow cytometer emitting a 488-nm beam.
Aggregated clumps were omitted from analysis with pulse area versus
pulse width gating. Data from 20,000 events were collected and analyzed.
Immunohistochemistry. Fresh tumor biopsies were collected before
initiating lapatinib therapy as part of a clinical trial in which patients with
recurrent inflammatory breast cancer early were treated with lapatinib
therapy alone (1,500 mg/d) conducted in accordance with the 1996 version
of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by
Institutional Review Boards at the participating institutions, and all
patients provided a signed informed consent. Biopsies were stained with
H&E to verify the presence of tumor. PTEN immunostaining was done
using the PTEN antibody obtained from Cascade BioScience, Inc.
(Winchester, MA). PTEN was processed with antigen retrieval using citrate
buffer (pH 6; DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) in the ‘‘decloaker’’
(Biocare Corp., Walnut Creek, CA). PTEN marker was immunostained using
the Autostainer (DakoCytomation). Envision + dual link polymer-HRP
(DakoCytomation) was used as the detection chemistry, and DAB +
(DakoCytomation) was used as the chromagen. After immunostaining, all
slides were counterstained manually with methyl green (DakoCytomation).
Statistical analysis. The association between PTEN-deficient (0,1+
immunohistochemistry) versus non-deficient (2,3+) and clinical response to
lapatinib was analyzed using m2 test generating m2, degree of freedom, and P.

Results
Early inhibition of ErbB2 autophosphorylation and downstream PI3K-Akt signaling by lapatinib. Trastuzumab reportedly
affects SRC phosphorylation, SRC-ErbB2 protein interactions,
PTEN activation, and Akt phosphorylation within 30 min of
treatment, before ErbB2 receptor internalization and downregulation (10). To determine whether lapatinib elicits similar
biological effects, we assessed ErbB2 phosphorylation, SRC
activation, and SRC-ErbB2 protein interactions in lapatinib-treated
BT474 and Au565 cells, two ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer
lines that are highly sensitive to lapatinib-induced apoptosis
(17, 18). Cells were treated with 1 Amol/L lapatinib, a clinically
relevant drug concentration previously shown to induce apoptosis
in BT474 and Au565 cells. After 40 min, cells were harvested, and
steady-state p-ErbB2 protein levels were assessed by Western blot
analysis. p-ErbB2 was assessed by Western blot after immunoprecipitating ErbB2 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4) or directly from total cell
extracts (lanes 6–9). In both cases, steady-state p-ErbB2 protein
levels were inhibited in lapatinib-treated cells compared with
vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 1A). In contrast, expression of pErbB2 increased in cells treated with trastuzumab (10 Ag/mL) for
40 min (Fig. 1A). Total ErbB2 protein remained unchanged in both
lapatinib and trastuzumab-treated cells (Fig. 1A). Consistent with
their respective effects on p-ErbB2, steady-state p-Akt protein
levels were inhibited after 40 min in lapatinib-treated but not
trastuzumab-treated cells (Fig. 1B).
We next examined the effect of lapatinib on the phosphorylation
of SRC at tyrosine residue 416 (Y416), a phosphorylation site
previously shown to be relevant to trastuzumab antitumor activity
(10). Steady-state p-SRC (Y416) protein levels were examined by
Western blot from cells treated with either lapatinib or
trastuzumab, as described above. p-SRC steady-state protein levels
remained unchanged in both lapatinib- and trastuzumab-treated
cells (Fig. 1C).

Figure 1. Lapatinib and trastuzumab differ in their early effects on the activation state of ErbB2 and SRC, SRC/ErbB2 protein interactions, and downstream
MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. A, inhibition of p-ErbB2 by lapatinib but not trastuzumab in ErbB2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells. BT474 and Au565 cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle; lanes 1 and 6), lapatinib (1 Amol/L; lanes 2 and 7), trastuzumab (10 Ag/mL; lanes 3
and 8), and lapatinib + trastuzumab (lanes 4 and 9). After 40 min of treatment, Western blot analysis for p-ErbB2 and total ErbB2 steady-state protein levels was done
after ErbB2 immunoprecipitated (lanes 1–4 ) or directly from equal amounts of protein from total cell lysate (lanes 5–9 ). Isotype-matched IgG control (lane 5) served
as a control for the immunoprecipitation. B, lapatinib but not trastuzumab inhibits p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 within 40 min. BT474 cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle;
lane 1), trastuzumab (10 Ag/mL; lane 2), or lapatinib (1 Amol/L; lane 3) for 40 min. Equal amounts of protein from total cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE, and
Western blot analysis of p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 steady-state protein levels were done. Total Akt and Erk1/2 protein levels served as controls for equal loading of protein.
C, effects of lapatinib on expression of activated p-SRC (Y416). BT474 and Au565 cells were treated for 40 min with DMSO (vehicle; lane 1), lapatinib (1 Amol/L;
lane 2), trastuzumab (10 Ag/mL; lane 3 ), and lapatinib + trastuzumab (lane 4 ). Equal amounts of protein from total cell lysate were then separated by SDS-PAGE,
and steady-state protein levels of p-SRC (Y416) were assessed by Western blot analysis. Total SRC protein served as a control for equal loading of protein.
Representative of three independent experiments.

SRC-ErbB2 protein interactions are regulated by ErbB2 phosphorylation state (21). We next examined the effect of lapatinib on
ErbB2-SRC protein interactions. ErbB2 was immunoprecipitated
from equal amounts of protein prepared from total cell extracts,
and then steady-state protein levels of total ErbB2, total SRC,
p-ErbB2, and p-SRC (Y416) were analyzed by Western blot. As shown
in Fig. 2, lapatinib did not affect ErbB2-SRC protein interactions. In
contrast, the amount of SRC protein associated with ErbB2
increased in trastuzumab-treated BT474 and Au565 cells (Fig. 2),
consistent with the increased expression of p-ErbB2 following
trastuzumab treatment. Vehicle-treated cells served as controls.
Genetic PTEN knockdown does not abrogate lapatinibinduced apoptosis. We next sought to determine whether the loss
of PTEN protein would affect the sensitivity of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells to lapatinib. BT474 and Au565 cells were
transfected with an siRNA construct specifically targeting PTEN. As
shown, PTEN mRNA and protein levels were effectively inhibited
following transfection with PTEN siRNA compared with a pooled
set of control siRNA constructs (siPool; Fig. 3A and B). The effect of
PTEN knockdown on lapatinib-induced apoptosis was then
assessed by cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining
and flow cytometry; cells containing <2N DNA content represented
an apoptotic cell population. Lapatinib was added to cell culture
48 h after siRNA transfection, when PTEN protein expression had
reached its nadir. Lapatinib did not affect PTEN protein expression
in siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). Loss of PTEN protein did not
affect the ability of lapatinib to induce apoptosis in BT474 or Au565
cells (Fig. 3D and E). Consistent with work that we previously

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

published (22, 23), trastuzumab did not induce apoptosis in BT474
or Au565 cells, making it difficult to assess the effects of PTEN
knockdown (data not shown). In addition, siRNA transfection did
not activate IFN-regulated gene expression, a potential nonspecific
effect of siRNA (data not shown).
PTEN status did not affect clinical response to lapatinib in
patients with ErbB2-overexpressing inflammatory breast
cancers. The clinical relevance of the previous cell-based
observations was examined in a phase II clinical trial of lapatinib
monotherapy in patients with recurrent inflammatory breast
cancer. Patients were administered 1,500 mg lapatinib orally once
a day on a continuous basis. Clinical response was assessed after

(10 Ag/mL; lanes 3 and 6). ErbB2 was immunoprecipitated (IP ) from equal
amounts of protein from total cell lysate. Steady-state p-ErbB2 and total SRC
protein levels were assessed by Western blot analysis. Representative of three

8 weeks of therapy according to the Response Evaluation Criteria

document response in non-target inflammatory skin changes.
Response rate was the primary objective of the study rather than
time to disease progression. PTEN protein expression was analyzed
by immunohistochemistry in fresh tumor tissue obtained before
therapy. Scoring of PTEN staining by immunohistochemistry
(0, 1, 2, and 3+) was conducted in a blinded fashion by a
centralized reference pathology laboratory (Targeted Molecular
Diagnostics, Westmont, IL). Shown are representative examples of
tumors expressing high (3+), low (1+), positive endothelial cell
staining, and a PTEN-negative tumor with positive staining in
adjacent perineural tissue (Fig. 4). Preliminary analysis of 38
evaluable patients, of which 15 responded, indicates that 73%
(11 of 15) exhibited low (1+) or absent (0) PTEN protein expression
(Table 1), consistent with PTEN deficiency not having an effect on
response status.

Discussion
Decisions regarding optimal cancer treatment will increasingly
be dependent upon molecular characterization of tumors rather
than histology alone. Establishing a tumor molecular profile for
predicting response to targeted therapies, such as small-molecule
inhibitors of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases, will likely require
multiple variables due to the highly complex nature of the
signaling networks that regulate cell proliferation and survival in
epithelial carcinomas. For example, the majority of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers do not respond to trastuzumab therapy
alone. PTEN deficiency seems to predict for resistance to
trastuzumab monotherapy in patients with ErbB2-overexpressing
metastatic breast cancers (10). The mechanism by which PTEN
contributes to the trastuzumab antitumor activity reportedly
involves the inhibition of SRC phosphorylation (Y416), disruption
of ErbB2-SRC protein interactions leading to PTEN activation, and
abrogation of PI3K-Akt signaling (10). This cascade of events
reportedly occurs within 30 min of trastuzumab therapy, before
ErbB2 receptor internalization and down-regulation. We now show
that PTEN deficiency does not abrogate the antitumor activity of
lapatinib in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, or in
ErbB2-overexpressing inflammatory breast cancers.
Despite targeting ErbB2, lapatinib and trastuzumab elicit
distinct biological effects on ErbB2 signaling. Lapatinib blocks
ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation in breast cancer cell lines, tumor
xenografts, and in patients with ErbB2-overexpressing breast
cancers (16–19). Inhibition of ErbB2 signaling and downstream
pathways by lapatinib occurs within 30 min following treatment
with clinically relevant drug concentrations. Rather than inhibiting ErbB2 phosphorylation, trastuzumab increased p-ErbB2
within 30 min without affecting Akt phosphorylation, consistent
with an early agonist effect on ErbB2 signaling. Interestingly,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

although lapatinib markedly inhibited p-ErbB2, it did not affect
SRC phosphorylation (Y416) or ErbB2-SRC protein interactions.
The explanation for this apparent discrepancy may be related to
the fact that ErbB2-SRC protein interactions are regulated
by ErbB2 phosphorylation on amino acid residues distinct from
the tyrosine autophosphorylation sites located in the COOHterminal region of the receptor (21). It is not clear that these
phosphorylation sites are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of
lapatinib. Although the phosphorylation sites that mediate
SRC-ErbB2 protein interactions might be insensitive to lapatinib,
they may be sensitive to increased ErbB2 phosphorylation in
response to trastuzumab, providing a possible explanation for the
increased association of SRC with ErbB2 observed in trastuzumabtreated cells.
PTEN dampens PI3K-Akt signaling in tumor cells by affecting
phosphorylation of Akt primarily on Ser473, although Thr308 may
also be modulated in some tumor cell lines (24, 25). Although
lapatinib inhibits Akt phosphorylation (S473) in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, the dependence of lapatinib
antitumor activity on the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation is
unclear. First, lapatinib induces tumor cell apoptosis even in the
absence of reduced p-Akt expression (22). Second, tumor cells
continue to proliferate despite complete inhibition of p-Akt by
lapatinib (23). And third, patients respond to lapatinib monotherapy in the absence of reduced p-Akt expression (16, 20). If the
inhibition of Akt phosphorylation is not essential for lapatinib
antitumor activity, then loss of PTEN protein should not render
cells resistant to lapatinib. In contrast, inhibition of survivin, a
member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family of proteins, seems to
be a better correlate of lapatinib antitumor activity (22).
PTEN is not the only regulator of Akt phosphorylation.
The protein phosphatase PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein
phosphatase (PHLPP) inactivates Akt by directly dephosphorylating Akt (Ser473), inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and survival
in vitro and in vivo (26). Although expression of PHLPP in primary
tumor tissue has not been reported, the prediction is that PHLPP
deficiency may contribute to tumor progression, independent of

Sensitivity of PTEN-Deficient Breast Cancers to Lapatinib

independent regulation of Akt phosphorylation by lapatinib.
MDA-MB-468 cells are insensitive to lapatinib-induced apoptosis
in part because they do not overexpress ErbB2 (19). Survivin is not
inhibited by lapatinib in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 5B), consistent
with the regulation of survivin being predominantly ErbB2
mediated in breast cancer cells (22). However, inhibition of ErbB1
signaling in lapatinib-treated MDA-MD-468 cells abrogates downstream Ras-Raf-MAPK-Erk1/2 signaling. Ras directly activates
PI3K-Akt (27), which might help explain how lapatinib inhibits
PI3K-Akt even in PTEN-null MDA-MB-468 cells.
In summary, lapatinib and trastuzumab not only differ in their
biological effects on signaling pathways in ErbB2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells but also in their dependence upon PTEN for
antitumor activity. Whereas PTEN deficiency reportedly predicts
for resistance to trastuzumab (10), it does not seem to play a role
in mediating lapatinib antitumor activity in ErbB2-overexpressing
breast cancers. Our clinical data are based on a small series of
patients with response rate as the primary objective and will
require confirmation in larger clinical trials with survival outcomes. Nonetheless, because PTEN deficiency occurs in f50% of
breast cancers, its status should be included in the molecular
characterization of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers to improve clinical outcome in patients whose breast cancers are PTEN
deficient by selecting ErbB2-targeted therapies whose antitumor
activity is PTEN independent.

Figure 5. Lapatinib inhibits p-Akt in a dose- and time-dependent manner in
PTEN-null MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. A, MDA-MB-468 cells were treated
with lapatinib at the indicated concentrations (lmol/L ). Cells were harvested after
72 h, and steady-state protein p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 protein levels were assessed
by Western blot analysis. Cells treated with DMSO (vehicle) served as a
control (C ). Total Erk1/2 protein served as a control for equal loading of protein.
B, MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with lapatinib (2.5 Amol/L) for the indicated
times (hrs ). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, and
steady-state protein levels of p-Akt, p-Erk1/2, and survivin were assessed by
Western blot. Total Erk1/2 protein served as a control for equal loading of
protein. Representative of three independent experiments.

the absence of PTEN. In this regard, lapatinib inhibits p-Akt in
PTEN-null MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in a dose- and timedependent manner (Fig. 5A and B), consistent with PTEN-
