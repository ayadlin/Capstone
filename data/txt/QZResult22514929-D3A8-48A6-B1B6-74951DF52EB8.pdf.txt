ABSTRACT
Disseminated triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an incurable disease with
limited therapeutic options beyond chemotherapy. Therefore, identification of druggable
vulnerabilities is an important aim. Protein kinases play a central role in cancer and
particularly in TNBC. They are involved in many oncogenic functions including migration,
proliferation, genetic stability or maintenance of stem-cell like properties. In this article
we describe a novel multi-kinase inhibitor with antitumor activity in this cancer subtype.
EC-70124 is a hybrid indolocarbazole analog obtained by combinatorial biosynthesis
of Rebeccamycin and Staurosporine genes that showed antiproliferative effect and in
vivo antitumoral activity. Biochemical experiments demonstrated the inhibition of the
PI3K/mTOR and JAK/STAT pathways. EC-70124 mediated DNA damage leading to
cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Pathway analyses identified several deregulated
functions including cell proliferation, migration, DNA damage, regulation of stem cell
differentiation and reversion of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype,
among others. Combination studies showed a synergistic interaction of EC-70124
with docetaxel, and an enhanced activity in vivo. Furthermore, EC-70124 had a good
pharmacokinetic profile. In conclusion these experiments demonstrate the antitumor
activity of EC-70124 in TNBC paving the way for the future clinical development of this
drug alone or in combination with chemotherapy.

[8]. Although the identification of subgroups in triple
negative cancer represents a major advance, unfortunately
the implementation of this classification for therapeutic
purposes is unclear [9]. Indeed available therapeutic
options for patients with TNBC are restricted to standard
treatment with chemotherapy [9].
Membrane receptors and downstream kinase
mediators are involved in the regulation of many cellular
activities associated with human transformation [10, 11],
including survival, response to DNA damage, migration,
morphogenesis, cell adhesion, stem cell differentiation or
proliferation, among others [12]. TNBC is a tumor subtype

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease as
demonstrated at a genomic level with the description
of different breast cancer subtypes with independent
clinical outcome [1, 2, 3, 4]. Among them, triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC) lacks the expression of hormone
receptors and HER2 overexpression, representing 15%
of all breast tumors [5]. It is associated with a specific
pattern of tumor relapse and an increased sensitivity to
chemotherapy [6, 7]. TNBC has been classified into
several subtypes with different sensitivities to treatment

characterized by a high metastatic capacity, presence of
stem cell precursors and a high proliferation rate [13,
14]. Similarly, alterations of the DNA repair machinery
seem to be of great significance in this cancer [15, 16].
This breast cancer subgroup is enriched with genes
associated to DNA damage response, when evaluated by
gene expression analyses [8]. There is also an increased
presence of somatic and acquired mutations in DNA
repair genes, mainly BRCA1 and BRCA2, involved in the
homologous recombination (HR) repair mechanism [15,
16]. Protein kinases also participate in the regulation and
maintenance of genetic integrity [17].
Using human samples, our group and others evaluated
the kinase profile of TNBCs, observing that a number of
these proteins are constitutively activated [18, 19]. These
included receptors and downstream mediators like ERK1/2,
SRC, ERK5, STAT1 and STAT3 [19]. Of particular
relevance was the activation of components of the PI3K/
mTOR/AKT pathway such as pS6 or AKT. Interestingly,
inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR route produced a proliferative
arrest in cellular models and a growth reduction in tumors
implanted in xenografted animals or generated using
transgenic models [19]. Sequencing approaches have also
confirmed the relevance of this route in TNBC suggesting
that the PI3K/mTOR pathway is a significant druggable
oncogenic alteration in this disease [20].
The translation of these findings to the clinical
setting has been occasionally disappointing. Clinical
studies evaluating drugs targeting individual proteins
or pathways have shown negative results suggesting
that therapeutic strategies should be designed to inhibit
a number of key oncogenic nodes [21, 22], rather than
individual kinases alone. This was the case for the
negative results when targeting the Epidermal Growth
Factor Receptor (EGFR) in TNBC [22]. Based on the
global importance of protein kinases in TNBC [23], the
development of novel polypharmacology inhibitors that
could hit relevant signalling pathways simultaneously, is
a desirable goal.
EC-70124 is a hybrid indolocarbazole analog
obtained by combinatorial biosynthesis of Rebeccamycin
and Staurosporine gene pathways and produced by
fermentation [24]. EC-70124 shows antitumor activity in
a wide range of solid tumors through the inhibition of key
signaling nodes at a nanomolar range [24]. EC-70124 has
completed its safety evaluation in preclinical models and
is starting its clinical development [24].
In the present study we evaluated the anti-tumor
properties of this novel multi-kinase inhibitor in TNBC.
We observed that EC-70124 is active against a panel of
TNBC cells and in xenografted mice. EC-70124 inhibited
relevant pathways in TNBC including the PI3K/mTOR
pathway or STAT1/3. In addition, it modified several
cellular functions including DNA damage, migration and
stem cell differentiation, among others. Finally EC-70124
synergized in vivo and in vitro with taxanes.

Antitumor effect of EC-70124 in TNBC
Figure 1A represents the chemical structure of EC70124. To explore the antitumor effect of this compound
on TNBC, we used a panel of representative cell lines
including HS578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231 and HCC3153.
In these cells, treatment with EC-70124 inhibited MTT
metabolization in a dose and time dependent manner
(Figure 1B, 1C). As shown in Figure 1C the IC50 values
for different time points were in the nanomolar range.
The clonogenic cell survival assay determines the
ability of a cell to proliferate indefinitely, thereby retaining
its reproductive ability to form a large colony or a clone.
Treatment with EC-70124 strongly decreased the number of
colonies formed at 10 days in HS578T, BT549 and MDAMB-231 (Figure 1D).
The effect of EC-70124 on three-dimensional
growth were also assessed. For this purpose, we cultured
HS578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-231 in matrigel, a
semisolid media where cells grow forming spherical
structures. Treatment with the drug strongly decreased
the diameter of these spheres (Figure 1E) (control vs
treatment, mean diameter and SD = 2.1 +/−0.15 vs 0.9
+/−0.14 and 2.6 +/−0.1 vs 1 +/−0.14, and 3 +/−0.17
vs 1 +/−0.18 for HS578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-231,
respectively). Similarly, a reduction in the total
number of colonies per plate was observed. This data
demonstrates the effect of EC-70124 on the inhibition of
cell growth in 3D cultures.
Finally, to investigate the in vivo effect of EC-70124
on the growth of TNBC, we implanted MDA-MB-231 into
the mammary fat pad of mice. Treatment with EC-70124
(18 mg/kg i.v. every 3 days) showed anti-tumor effect
compared to control (Figure 1F). The mean tumor volume
(mm3) measured every 3 days was significantly higher in
the control versus the treated group (day 22; control vs
treated, mean volume 826 vs 369 mm3, SD +/−376 and
+/−121.5, respectively; p = 0.036). We also measured the
drug effect on body weight and other toxicity parameters
as mice behavior or skin modifications. We did not find
differences between control vs treated animals in any of
these parameters (Supplementary Figure S1A).

Effect of EC-70124 on the TNBC kinase profile
To evaluate the effect of EC-70124 on several
protein kinases in HS578T and BT549, we used two
phospho-kinase array kits. EC-70124 was able to inhibit
downstream components of the PI3K/AKT pathway
including AKT (phosphorylated at T308 and S473) and
pS6 (Figure 2A). We confirmed these results by Westernblot analyses, except for the inhibition of pAKT-S473 in
BT549 (Figure 2B). Similarly, p-Stat3 and p-Stat1 were
also inhibited in HS578T and BT549 (Figure 2A, 2B).

Of note, we were unable to confirm by Western-blot the
inhibition of pErk1/2 observed in the kinase array.
To have a global view of the kinase activity of
EC-70124, a 169 kinase panel using a mobility shift
assay at 1mM ATP concentration for all kinases (well
above their Km value and similar to the intracellular ATP
concentration) was profiled by Carna Biosciences (Kobe,
Japan). Figure 2C shows a list of kinases with various
degrees of inhibition at 100 nM EC-70124. Some of the
RTKs for which EC-70124 showed inhibitory effect in the
kinase assay were not affected in HS578T and BT549.
This effect although surprising could be explained by the
limited phosphorylated expression of RTK in cell lines
in basal conditions compared with other downstream
mediators (Supplementary Figure S1B).

annotations, it was possible to organize and summarize
the results in 4 main categories (Figure 4A, 4B, 4C and
4D): gene sets associated with DNA damage response,
translation and regulation of gene expression were upregulated as shown in Figure 4A; gene sets down-regulated
in the treated samples included functions or pathways such
as: cell mesenchymal development/morphogenesis and
regulation of stem cell differentiation (Figure 4B); EMT
related glycan metabolism (Figure 4C); cell adhesion,
extracellular matrix, migration and proliferation (Figure
4D). A list of selected modified genes included in these
gene sets is shown in Supplementary Table S2.
Next, we explored whether some of the observed
functions could be confirmed with cellular and bio­
chemical experiments. As shown in Figure 5A treatment
with EC-70124 reduced cell migration in MDA-MB-231,
BT549 and HS578T. Similarly we confirmed the reduced
expression of CD44, ALDH1, CD49f and CD133 after
treatment with EC-70124, all representative stem cell
markers associated with the “regulation of stem cell
differentiation” pathway (Figure 5B).

EC-70124 induces G2/M arrest
To gain insights into the mechanism of the
antiproliferative action of EC-70124 we explored the
effect of the drug on cell cycle and apoptosis. Propidium
iodide staining of HS578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-231
showed that EC-70124 induced accumulation of cells in
G2/M phase (Figure 3A, 3B), an effect which was more
pronounced at 24 h (15%, 22% and 18% increase for
HS578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-231, respectively). Next,
we used Annexin V staining to explore the effect of EC70124 on apoptosis, observing an increase at 48 hours,
more evident in HS578T (Figure 3C).
Induction of apoptosis can be caspase-dependent
or caspase-independent. To explore the mechanism
of cell death induced by the drug we treated HS578T,
BT549 and MDA-MB-231 with the pancaspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK and evaluated Annexin V staining at
48 hours. We found no modifications in apoptosis with
and without the presence of the pancaspase inhibitor in
HS578T and BT549, and a small decrease in apoptosis
in MDA-MB-231, showing that the proapoptotic effect is
mainly independent of caspases (Figure 3D). In addition,
treatment with EC-70124 did not produce cleavage of
PARP at different time points (Figure 3E).

EC-70124 induces DNA damage
Among causes that produce an increase of DNA
repair genes and an arrest at G2/M phase is the presence
of lesions in the DNA and the subsequent intent to repair
and maintain its integrity [17]. In the gene enrichment
analyses we observed that EC-70124 induced genes
related to DNA repair mechanism at 24 hours that were
also confirmed by qPCR (PRMT6, RAD52, GADD45A,
XPA, LIG4, FANCF, BRCA1, BRCA2, DDB2) (Figure
5C, 5D). Therefore, to investigate if EC-70124 induced
DNA damage, we analyzed the levels of phosphorylated
γH2AX. It is known that this protein is required for
checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest and DNA repair
following double-stranded DNA breaks [17, 25].
Treatment with EC-70124 in HS578T, BT549 and MDAMB-231 showed an increase in the phosphorylated levels
of γH2AX at early time points (Figure 5E). In response
to DNA DSBs, ATM phosphorylates multiple substrates
including, Chk2, p53, and γH2AX [17, 26]. We observed
that EC-70124 induced the phosphorylation of p53 and
Chk2 (Figure 5E) confirming the induction of DNA
damage.

EC-70124 modifies different pathways
In parallel to the biochemical analyses, we also
performed mRNA expression profiling studies. For this
purpose, we treated MDA-MB-231 with EC-70124 using
the IC50, and extracted mRNA at 24 hours. A gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) based on a comprehensive
pathway database (4319 gene sets) identified 938 gene
sets affected by the drug treatment (p-value <= 0.025
and FDR <= 0.25), representing diverse biological
functions (Supplementary Table S1 –GSEA_table). A
network was created and grouped these gene-sets in 166
functional modules. Based on the gene overlap between
these modules (map layout) as well as the functional

chemotherapies
As success in cancer therapy is based on drug
combinations, we investigated the effect of EC-70124
in association with chemotherapies used in the clinical
setting for triple negative tumors; including vinorelbine,
docetaxel, and carboplatin. We did first a dose response
curve with these chemotherapies to select doses around
the IC50 (data not shown). Next we combined EC-70124

with these agents. In general, administration of EC-70124
with vinorelbine, carboplatin and docetaxel increased the
anti-proliferative effect of each agent given alone (data not
shown). To identify synergistic interactions we combined
several doses of EC-70124 in the nanomolar range with
doses of these agents around or below the IC50 in BT549,
HS578T and MDA-MB-231. For this purpose we used the
Chou-Talalay algorithm for combination index analysis
[27]. Combinations with vinorelbine were antagonistic
in MDA-MB-231 and BT549, and only additive for some
doses in HS578T (Figure 6A). By contrast most doses for
docetaxel and carboplatin were strongly synergistic or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

additive in the three cell lines (Figure 6A). The strongest
synergism for the three cell lines was observed with the
combination of EC-70124 with docetaxel. These findings
were confirmed by clonogenic analyses using docetaxel
and carboplatin. In HS578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-231
the number of colonies formed were reduced with the
combined treatments compared with agents given alone
(Supplementary Figure S1C).
Given the fact that docetaxel and carboplatin
were synergistic, we evaluated the effect on apoptosis
of the combination of these agents with EC-70124.

carboplatin to BT549 and HS578T clearly induced

findings suggest that the addition of some chemotherapies
to EC-70124 augmented the cell death obtained with the
kinase inhibitor.

combination EC-70124 + carboplatin. Docetaxel clearly
inhibited tumor growth and the combination of EC-70124
with docetaxel reduced tumor volume in a statistically
significant manner compared with docetaxel alone (Figure
6B). No differences in mice weight were observed among
different groups (data not shown).
To explore the pharmacodynamic effect of EC70124 in vivo, we treated mice injected with MDAMB-231, and sacrificed the animals at different time

extracted tumors we observed a clear reduction of pS6 and

PARP was observed and a slight reduction of PCNA, a
marker of proliferation was identified at short times (we
used the leukemic cell K562 treated with doxorubicin as
a positive control for PARP degradation; Supplementary
Figure S2A). These data confirm the findings observed
in our biochemical studies in cell lines showing that EC70124 reduced pS6 and STAT1/STAT3, in addition to an
induction of DNA damage. In addition, we treated animals
with EC-70124 (18 mg/kg iv) for 24 hours and evaluated
pS6, Ki67 and TUNEL by immunohistochemistry. We
observed a clear reduction of pS6, Ki67; and an induction
of apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B).
In parallel we evaluated the concentration of the
drug in two resected tumors per time point. Figure 6D
shows time-dependent accumulation, reaching over
1000 ng/g (>2.2 μM) well above levels used in successful
cell line experiments. Finally, by using another set of
animals (healthy CD1 mice) we did a pharmacokinetic
evaluation of EC-70124 at 20 mg/kg. As can be seen in
Figure 6E, EC-70124 shows plasma levels well above
needed for therapeutic action. The pharmacokinetic profile
was typical of iv administration, with Cmax >25 μM at
5 min and the levels going exponentially down over time,
at 1 h 12 μM, at 4 h 4.5 μM and 8 h 2.2 μM and at 24 h
100 nM. The area under the curve (AUC) was 33 μg/mL/h
and the half life 3.1 h.

In TNBC several membrane and intracellular
kinases are concomitantly activated suggesting that
combinatorial strategies or inhibition of central signaling
nodes could be more effective than single target inhibition
[19, 21]. The PI3K/mTOR and the MAPK pathway are
commonly phosphorylated in this tumor type [19]. Less
frequent activated kinases include STAT1, STAT3 or SRC,
among others [19]. Our data corroborated these findings
and furthermore describe the kinase inhibitory profile
of EC-70124 on these routes. EC-70124 produced a
decrease in phosphorylation of the mTORC1 downstream
component pS6. Interestingly, inhibition of the mTORC2
route by EC-70124 resulted distinct in BT549 and
HS578T. In the latter cell line, treatment with the drug
inhibited AKT phosphorylation at serine 473, a site
whose phosphorylation is due to the activity of mTORC2
complexes. In contrast, S473 phosphorylation was
unaffected by EC70124 in BT549 cells, indicating that
the mTORC2-inhibiting capability of the drug may differ
among distinct cell lines. The effect on the JAK pathway
was confirmed when we evaluated the kinase profile of
the drug. In our experiments doses of the drug in the
nanomolar range were able to produce growth inhibition
in a panel of TNBC cell lines at the same dose that
inhibited efficiently the mentioned routes. Among those
the PI3K/mTOR seems to be of substantial importance. In
previous experiments inhibition of this pathway in TNBC
produced a profound antitumor activity in cell lines and
in xenografted tumors [19]. Those findings helped guide
the development of inhibitors against this pathway in the
clinical setting [19, 30]. EC-70124 inhibited other relevant
pathways such as the JAK/STAT; route that is involved in
the genesis of breast tumors with stem cell properties, a
finding that is in line with the down-regulation of gene-sets
related to regulation of stem cell differentiation and the
reduction of several stem-cell markers measured with flow
cytometry [13]. Of note, no effect on RTK was observed
as there was a minimal constitutive phosphorylation in
the cell lines. The inhibition of the mentioned proteins
were also confirmed in pharmacodynamic experiments
showing that the drug reached the tumor at early time
points. The presence of the drug was evaluated in two
tumors per time point showing a remarkable exposure.
Finally pharmacokinetic experiments confirmed a tipical
iv elimination curve with concentrations of the drug above
the micromolar range at 8 hours.
Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) revealed
deregulation of many cellular functions including cell
morphogenesis; regulation of stem cell differentiation;
EMT phenotype, migration and DNA damage, among
others. As a multikinase inhibitor with effect on different
cancer-relevant kinases, it is expected to observe the
inhibition of several functions. Among them, cell
migration was inhibited by the drug in the same amount as
other kinase inhibitors with known capabilities to reduce

DISCUSSION
The prognosis of TNBC patients is poor due to the
limited therapeutic options and the lack of specific targeted
agents [28]. Given the importance of protein kinases
including RTKs or downstream mediators in this subtype
of breast cancer, we explored the antitumor activity and
mechanism of action of the novel kinase inhibitor EC70124. In addition, as basal-like tumors show an increase
in proliferation, metastatic spreading, early relapse and
an impairment of DNA repair mechanisms, it would be
desirable to identify a drug that would affect some of these
deregulated functions.
Natural products are well known by their pleiotropic
mechanism of action. The combinatorial biosynthesis of
Rebeccamycin and Staurosporine gene pathways led to
EC-70124, a hybrid indolocarbazole analog obtained by
recombinant fermentation [24]. Treatment with EC-70124
reduced proliferation and colony formation in several
TNBC cell models. Studies in animals showed the antitumor activity of EC-70124 in vivo with no evidence of
relevant toxicity. When the mechanism of action was
evaluated, we observed that administration of EC-70124
induced DNA damage at short times measured by the
phosphorylation of γH2AX and other proteins including
the phosphorylated forms of p53 and Chk2, all of them
downstream effectors of ATM and ATR in response to
DNA insults [25, 26, 29].

this function. Several markers used to identify populations
with stem cell characteristics, were also reduced after
treatment with EC-70124 [13, 31]. Furthermore, the JAK/
STAT pathway, that is required for the growth of stem celllike breast cancers [13], was also inhibited by EC-70124
in our biochemical studies.
DNA repair was one of the functions altered by the
drug. At longer times we observed an increased expression
of genes involved in DNA repair; genes that probably
were synthesized in response to a DNA insult. This
observation was confirmed by qPCR of the upregulated
genes including BRCA2, LIG4, GADD45 or XPA,
among others. Although induction of DNA damage is an
infrequent effect of kinase inhibitors, we have observed
before that the combination of dasatinib, a multi-TK
inhibitor, with trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 antibody,
produced a similar effect on DNA [32].
Physiological repair of DNA damage requires
cells to arrest [17]. In our experiment we observed by
flow cytometry how treatment with EC-70124 induced
an arrest in G2/M. Induction of apoptosis evaluated by
Annexin V staining was observed at 48 hours suggesting
that some cells were unable to repair their DNA and finally
led to cell death. This induction of apoptosis was largely
independent of the activation of caspases. In addition,
combination of EC-70124 with chemotherapy increase
apoptosis compared with each agent given alone.
When combined with chemotherapies, EC-70124
produced a synergistic effect with docetaxel opening the
door for potential combinations with these agents in the
clinical setting. Taxanes are one of the gold standards in
the treatment of this disease. In line with this, the studies
in animals showed that EC-70124 increased the antitumor
effect of docetaxel, compared with the effect of each agent
given alone. A much limited effect was observed with the
combination of carboplatin.
Globally, our article describes a novel multikinase inhibitor with a remarkable antitumor activity in
TNBC. The pleiotropic nature of the effects of this drug,
which affects cell cycle progression, migration or stemlike properties of TNBC cells offers the possibility of
acting on all those oncogenic pathways using a single
agent. Moreover, its synergistic effect with drugs that
are commonly used to treat TBNC patients opens the
possibility for the development of EC-70124 alone or in
combination with those drugs in the clinical setting.

collection development in the laboratories of Drs S Ethier
and A Gazdar to avoid errors occurring when obtained
through ’second-hand’ sources). In addition cells were
analyzed by STR at the molecular biology unit at the
Salamanca University Hospital. Cell lines were maintained
in DMEM (HS578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231) and RPMI
(HCC3153) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin and
2 mM L-glutamine, respectively. The cell culture medium
and supplements were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). The multi-kinase inhibitor EC-70124 was
prepared via a proprietary process by Entrechem S.L.
(Oviedo, Spain). Chemotherapeutic agents (Docetaxel,
Carboplatin and Vinorelbine) were purchased from
Selleckchem.

Cell proliferation studies: MTT assays,
matrigel-embedded culture experiments
and clonogenic assays
The effect of drugs on cell proliferation was
assessed using MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) screening assay. This
experiment is based on the ability of living cells to convert
MTT, a yellow tetrazole, into a purple colored formazan
product with an absorbance maximum near 570 nm.
Thus, a decrease in the amount cells amount will result
in a reduced purple colouring. HS578T, BT549, MDAMB-231 and HCC3153 cells were plated at 10,000 cells
per well in 48-multiwell plates and cultured overnight in
DMEM and RPMI + 10% FBS. The next day, cells were
treated for three days with increasing concentrations
of EC-70124 alone or in combination with various
chemotherapeutics to plot the dose–response curves and
for synergy studies, respectively. In parallel, the IC50
value was determined by cell treatment with increasing
amounts of EC-70124 at three-time points (24 h, 48 h
and 72 h of incubation). After drug administration, the
medium was replaced with 400 μL of fresh medium
DMEM without phenol red containing MTT (0.5 μg/μL)
and incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C. The medium was
then removed and 200 μL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
were added to each well. The plate was agitated in the dark
for 5 minutes to dissolve the MTT-formazan crystals. The
absorbance of the samples was recorded at 562 nm (555–
690) in a multiwell plate reader (BMG labtech). Results
were plotted as the mean values of quadruplicates from a
representative experiment that was repeated at least two
independent times.
For drug combination studies, synergy was
confirmed using Calcusyn Version 2.0 software (Biosoft,
Ferguson, MO) by determining combinational index (CI)
based on the algorithm reported by Chou and Talalay [27].
Values <1 represent synergistic effect on cell proliferation
of the 2 drugs, values equal to 1 indicate additive effect

of the drugs, and values >1 represent an antagonistic
effect. Combination index values from three independent
experiments were generated and plotted.
For three-dimensional cell culture experiments,
HS578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Following
passage, cells were trypsinized (0.5 g porcine trypsin and
0.2 g EDTA 4Na, purchased from Sigma Aldrich) and
resuspended in growth medium containing 2% Matrigel.
Then, cells were seeded at a density of 12.500 cells/ml in a
48-multiwell plate containing an underlying approximately
1 mm thick bed of Matrigel and incubated at 37°C. Next
day, cells were treated with EC-70124 and cultured for
7 days. The assay included the daily visualization of cells
under a light microscope to monitor the phenotype.
For clonogenic studies, cells were seeded at a
density of 500,000 cells in a 100 mm culture dishes, and
treated, the next day, with with EC-70124 (300 nM),
docetaxel (0.5 nM), EC-70124 + docetaxel, carboplatin
(20 μM) and EC-70124 + Carboplatin. After 24-hours
treatment, cells were trypsinized, resuspended in 5 ml
of complete growth medium to perform serial dilutions
1/10 and seeded, in triplicate, in 6-multiwell plates for 10
days. Then, the medium was removed and the number of
colonies were determined.

For Annexin V/PI experiments, 500 nM EC-70124
treated cells (at a density of 500,000 cells/100 mm dish)
were washed twice with PBS, and stained with 5 μl of
Annexin V-DT-634 (Immunostep S.L., Salamanca, Spain)
and 3 μl of Propidium iodide (10 mg/ml) in 1x Binding
Buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaOH, 2.5 mM
CaCl2) for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. The
apoptotic cells were determined using a FACSCanto II
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Both early apoptotic
(Annexin V-positive, PI-negative) and late (Annexin
V-positive and PI-positive) apoptotic cells were included
in cell death determinations.

Preparation of cell extracts and western-blotting
HS578T and BT549 cells were plated at a density
of 500,000 cells/100 mm dish, maintained overnight in
DMEM + 10% FBS, and treated later with EC-70124 at
500 nM for 6, 12 and 24 hours. After treatment, cells were
washed with cold PBS and lysed in cold lysis buffer (20
mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.0], 140 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA,
10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μM pepstatin, 1 μg/
mL aprotinin, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethyl
sulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). Then,
insoluble material was removed by centrifugation.
The protein concentration was determined using BCA
(Bicinchoninic acid) protein assay kit (Sigma Aldrich).
For Western-blotting, 50 μg protein was resolved
by 6%–15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore
Corporation). Blots were blocked in 1x Tris-buffered
saline (TBS, 100 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 0.05%
Tween 20) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% of bovine
serum albumin for 1 hour and then incubated overnight
with the following primary human monoclonal/policlonal
antibodies: anti-pS473-AKT, anti-pH2AX (BD Biosciences),
anti-pERK1/2, PARP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-pS6, anti-pSTAT3, anti-pSTAT1, anti-pT308-AKT
(Cell Signalling Technology). Protein-bound primary
antibodies were detected using respective horseradish
peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit
for polyclonal and anti-mouse for monoclonal, obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:5,000 in 1x
TBS containing 0.05% Tween and incubated for 1 hour at
room temperature. Protein bands were detected using ECL
Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).

Wound-healing assay for cell migration
HS578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells were plated
at a density of 300,000 cells/60 mm dish and maintained
overnight in DMEM + 10% FBS. Following incubation,
culture medium was removed and a wound in the cell
monolayers was generated by scratching with a 200-μl
pipette tip. Photographs were taken of the initial wound for
comparison. Then, DMEM + 10% FBS was added and cells
were treated for 48 hours with either 500 nM EC-70124 or
100 nM Dasatinib, as a negative control. Cell migration was
visualized at ×10 magnification and photographed. Each
experiment was completed in duplicate.

Cell cycle and apoptosis detection assays
For cell cycle analysis, HS578T, BT549 and
MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at a density of 500,000
cells/100 mm dish and maintained overnight in DMEM
+ 10% FBS. Cells were then treated with 500 nM of
EC-70124 for 24 hours. After drug treatment, cells
were trypsinized, fixed in ice cold 70% ethanol for
30 minutes and subsequently centrifuged at 5000 rpm for
5 minutes. Cell pellets were washed in PBS + 2% BSA
and treated with Propidium iodide/RNAse staining
solution (Immunostep S.L., Salamanca, Spain) in the dark
for 1 hour at 4°C, and analyzed then on FACSCanto II
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The percentage of each
cell cycle phase was determined by plotting DNA content
against cell number using the FACS Diva software.

Phospho-kinase antibody array and
immunohistochemistry
To evaluate whether EC-70124 treatment causes a
change in the kinase phosphorylation profiling of human
breast cancer cell, two different commercial arrays, the
human phospho-RTK array kit (# ARY001, R&D Systems,
27934

Oncotarget

Gene-set enrichment analysis

Abingdon, UK) and the PathScan RTK Signaling Antibody
Array Kit (# 7982, Cell Signaling Technology) were used.
The array kits allows for the simultaneous detection of
receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling nodes,
when phosphorylated at tyrosine or other residues. Targetspecific capture antibodies, biotinylated protein (positive
control) and non-specific IgG (negative control) have
been spotted in duplicate onto the array membrane. Cell
lysates were diluted to a total protein concentration and
incubated with the RTK arrays according to manufacturer’s
instructions. After binding the domain of both phosphorylated
and unphophorylated tyrosine kinases, unbound material
was washed away. A pan anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used to
detect phosphorylated tyrosines on activated receptors by
chemiluminescence. Quantitation of the different RTKs and
cell signaling intermediates in the human phospho-RTK array
kit was performed using the Quantity One analysis software
(Bio-Rad, CA, USA) and expressed as the pixel density (OD/
mm2). The pixel density of the background was subtracted
from the pixel density of each spot, and the average of
duplicate spots was determined. Next, Signal intensity was
calculated by the normalization of mean pixel density in
each spot against the pixel density of the positive control.
Significance was determined using a cut-off point of density
signal higher than 0.6.
For the immunohistochemistry evaluation, tumour
samples from mice were obtained and fixed with
formaldehyde 24 hours at room temperature. After the
samples were embedded in paraffin, they were cut into
thin slices and mounted on slides for subsequent analysis.
The immunohistochemistry for ki67, pS6 were performed
as described [33, 34] and TUNEL was performed
following the manufacturer’s instructions (In situ cell
Death Detection Kit, AP, Roche).

The MBEI data for all probesets were further
imported into the GSEA software [26] to perform geneset enrichment analysis using 2000 gene-set permutations,
minimum gene-set size of 5, maximum gene-set size of 500
and t-test as the scoring metric. The gene-sets included in
the GSEA analyses were obtained from KEGG, MsigDB-c2,
NCI, Biocarta, IOB, Netpath, HumanCyc, Reactome and
the Gene Ontology (GO) databases, updated August 2014
(http://baderlab.org/GeneSets). EnrichmentMap (version
2.0, automatic labelling option, Cytoscape 3.2.1) was used
to visualize enriched gene-sets with a nominal p-value <
0.025 and a False Discover Rate < 0.25.

Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
(qRT-PCR)
Untreated and EC-70124-treated cells were collected
and mRNA levels of the indicated genes were determined
by quantitative reverse- transcription PCR. Briefly, total
RNA was obtained from cells using RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s
instruction. After extraction, concentration and purity were
determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and, subsequently, 3 μg
of total RNA was reversely transcribed using RevertAid
H Minus First Strand cDNA syntesis Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA) in a thermocycler (Bio-Rad) under the
following reaction conditions: 65°C for 5 min, 42°C for 60
min and 70°C for 10 min. The cDNAs were then subjected
to a real-time PCR analysis using Fast SYBR Green Master
Mix in StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Primer sequences for the genes are shown in Supplementary
Table S3. An initial step was performed at 95°C for 10 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and finished by
60°C for 1min. each sample was analyzed in triplicates and
cycle threshold (Ct) values of transcripts was determined
using StepOne Software v.2.1. The ΔCt values were
calculated using GAPDH as reference. Untreated cells were
used as control to calculate the ΔΔCt value and to determine
the X-fold mRNA expression.

Microarray analysis of mRNA
MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in DMEM with
10% of FBS and added to a final concentration of 500,000
cells/plate. Next day cells were treated with 500 nM EC70124 for 24 h. Total RNA from 3 independent control
samples and 3 independent treated cells was extracted and
purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Doublestranded cDNA and biotinylated cRNA were synthesized
using a T7 polyT primer and the BioArray RNA labeling
kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY), respectively.
The labeled RNA was fragmented and hybridized
to human oligonucleotide arrays (Human Gene ST
Arrays) (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Affymetrix CEL files were
imported into the dChip software (Dana Farber Cancer
Institute, Boston, MA): normalization of all arrays was
done using a pair-wise rank invariant probe method and
expression level of each probeset was calculated using the
model-based expression index (MBEI).

Xenograft studies
Mice were handled at the animal facility following
legal guidelines. Female BALB/cAnNRi-Foxn1nu/Foxn1nu
mice, 5 weeks old were obtained from Janvier Labs. After 10
days quarantine, 2–5 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells in 100 μL
of DMEM with 20% Matrigel were injected into the
mammary fat pads of mice. Two weeks after the injection,
mice were randomly assigned into two groups (with equal
average tumor volumes before initiation of treatments)

2 weeks, when tumors reached a volume of 100 mm3
treatment was initiated. Animals were inhalatorily
anaesthetized and then treated with EC70124 i.v. (18 mg/
kg) every three days. For combinatory studies, when tumors
reached a volume of 200 mm3 treatment was initiated, in
this case, we used EC-70124 (14 mg/kg) every three days
alone or in combination with carboplatin (15 mg/kg) or
docetaxel (15 mg/kg) ip weekly for 3 consecutive weeks
(n = 5 for all groups). Tumors diameters were measured
every three days and tumor volumes were calculated using
the following formula: V = (L × W2)/2, where V = volume
(cubic millimeters), L = length (millimeters) and W = width
(millimeters). Mice were killed by CO2 inhalation.
