ABSTRACT
Here we showed that ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpene natural product,
and its novel prodrug derivative US597 suppressed cancer cells adhesion, invasion
and migration. This effect was accompanied by inhibition of focal adhesion signaling
pathway including alterations in ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, integrin
α6β1, FAK, Src, paxillin and PTEN. While oral administration of UA or US597 increases
survival rate of melanoma lung metastasis in C57BL/6 mice, US597 treatment extend
the survival rate above that of UA. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that
US597 treatment regulates ICAM-1, a biomarker of metastasis. We did not detect
side effects with US597 in mice such as weight loss, viscera tissues toxicity and blood
cell abnormalities. Thus, UA and US597 are potential drug candidates for preventing
cancer metastasis. Molecular and cellular study data suggest that UA and US597
modulate expression of cell adhesion molecules within focal adhesion signaling
pathway leading to cancer cell motility.

expression and activity of CAMs can reduce the cancer
metastasis [4–6], which indicated that anti-adhesion is
an effective strategy for cancer metastasis inhibition. The
integrin family of adhesion molecules, a specific class
of adhesion receptors, is involved in various processes
associated with adhesion, migration, invasion of tumor cells
[7, 8]. Integrins and their downstream signaling partners
(such as FAK, Src, paxillin and PTEN) play an important
role in cell adhesion [9], and inhibition of integrins
expression may have a beneficial effect on anti-metastasis
therapy [10–13]. Among them, it has been shown that the
α6β1 integrins plays a key role in hepatocellular carcinoma
metastasis [11, 12]. Consequently, the therapy of antiadhesion may be a direction that prevents the recurrence
and metastasis of tumor, and it is necessary to develop
novel effective drugs to inhibit cancer metastasis.
Ursolic acid (UA), 3β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic

INTRODUCTION
Metastasis is one of the major causes of mortality
in cancer patients, although surgical removal of tumors
can enhance and prolong survival [1]. Cancer metastasis
involves an intricate multiprocess cascade including
cell adhesion, migration, invasion, cell-to-cell and cellto-ECM (extracellular matrix) interactions. The major
cause of cancer-related deaths is often due to tumor cells
adhesion, invasion and migration, which results in the
formation of distant metastasis.
The adhesion between tumor cells and vascular
endothelial cells is one of the crucial procedures of
cancer early metastasis [2]. The cell adhesion molecules
(CAMs), such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
(VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
and endothelial cell selectin (E-selectin), which expressed
by endothelial cells may play a critical role in the cancer
metastasis [3]. There is strong evidence that blocking the

concentrations of compounds. UA and US597 sufficiently
inhibited L02 cells only at concentrations of 41.92 and 13.95
μM, respectively. In the mean time, UA and US597 inhibited
HUVEC cells viability at a much higher concentration with
an IC50 value of 51.08 and 16.48 μM, respectively. By
comparison, the cytotoxicity of UA or US597 was very low
at the concentration of 0.2–5 μM. Based on the comparison,
SW620, B16-F10 and HepG2 cells were then chosen for
further studies to explore UA/US597 anti-metastasis in vitro.

plants especially in the leaves and berries of natural
medicinal plants, such as bearberry, cranberry, rosemarry
and in the protective wax-like coatings of apples, pears,
prunes and other fruits. It exhibits comprehensive biologic
properties in a variety of human diseases, including antiinflammatory [14], anti-angiogenesis [15], anti-cancer
[16, 17], anti-HIV [18] and antimalarial [19] activities.
Among them, antiproliferative, proapoptotic, suppressed
tumor invasion and anti-metastatic potential of ursolic acid
have been reported in both in vitro cell culture systems
and in vivo experiments [20, 21]. In a previous study, we
showed that a novel UA derivative US597 has significant
anti-tumor activities including anti-proliferation, induction
of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, mitochondrial inhibition and
apoptosis/necrosis induction [22]. Because UA and most
of its derivatives (UAs) are relatively non-toxic to normal
cells [23], an important implication of these findings
is that they might play a useful role in the treatment of
cancer metastasis. However, little is known regarding the
anti-adhesion and anti-invasion effects of UAs as well as
their exact molecular mechanisms of actions and related
pathways on tumor metastasis.
In the current study, we investigated the antimetastasis effect of UA and its derivative US597 on the
cell growth, adhesion, invasion and migration of SW620,
B16-F10 and HepG2 cells in vitro, and further explored
the underlying mocelular mechanism of UA/US597 on the
IL-1β -induced cell-surface CAMs expression in HUVECs
and integrin-mediated focal adhesion signaling pathway
in tumor cells. Additionally, we evaluated whether UA/
US597 had a potential for the prevention or treatment of
cancer metastasis in vivo by the B16-F10/C57BL/6 mouse
melanoma lung metastasis model.

Effect of UA/US597 on the adhesion, invasion
and migration of tumor cells in vitro
Tumor cells adhesion to the ECM is a fundamental
step in cancer metastasis, we first evaluated the adhesion
effect of UA/US597 on SW620, B16-F10 and HepG2
cancer cells to HUVECs at non-cytotoxic concentrations.
The tumor cells were labeled with a fluorescent dye
rhodamine 123, fluorescence microscope observation
revealed that US597 interfered adhesion of HepG2
cells to HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner
(Figure  2A). To quantitatively examine the intervention
by UA/US597 of tumor cells adhered to HUVECs,
10 fields of each well were randomly selected, and the
adhered spots were counted. Compared with the control
group, the adhesion rate of HepG2 cells was 84.83 ±
3.35% (P < 0.05) in UA-treated group, and the adhesion
rate of SW620, B16-F10 and HepG2 cells was 73.93 ±
3.58%, 59.26 ± 2.29%, 44. 16 ± 4.22%, respectively,
corresponding to 5 μM of US597 (Figure 2B), indicating
that US597 may fit into a new class of therapy for the
reduction of risk factors for cancer metastasis.
To determine whether UA/US597 affects the
invasion and migration of SW620, B16-F10 and HepG2
cells, the invasion assay and the wound-healing assay
were performed. In the transwell assay, UA/US597
decreased invaded cell number 24 h after drug treatment.
The average number of invaded HepG2 cells in the control
group was 88 ± 5, in UA group, the average number of
invaded cells was 75 ± 3, and the number were 78 ± 3,
60 ± 5, and 28 ± 6 in US597 groups, respectively
(Figure 2A). On the other hand, UA/US597 exhibition on
invasion of the SW620 and B16-F10 cell lines through the
transwell membrane at low concentrations suggesting its
specific inhibition on cell invasion (Figure 2C).
In wound healing assay (Figure 2A and 2D), the
speed of wound healing of HepG2 cells movement was
significantly lower than that of control cells. The wound of
HepG2 cells was almost closed 24 h after wounding, while
the cells treated with various concentrations of US597
stayed wide apart, showing US597 inhibited cell motility
dose-dependently. Whereas UA treated group showed less
migration in wound area under the same condition. In
addition, the inhibition on cell migration might be more
effective on HepG2 cells compared to SW620 or B16-F10
cells. The wound healing assay demonstrated that the

RESULTS
Effect of UA/US597 on cell viability
To explore the metastatic chemopreventive function
of UA/US597, we first examined cytotoxic effect against
nine different cancer cell lines including MHCC-97H,
MHCC-97L, HepG2, M619, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7,
HT29, SW620 and B16-F10 after treatment with various
concentrations of UA/US597 for 24 h, and the viability
of cells was determined with MTT assays. As shown in
Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1, the IC50 values
for UA to suppress cell proliferation varied from 31.65–
60.11 μM in nine cancer cell lines, and we found that
US597 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in all 9 cell
lines in a dose-dependent manner, the IC50 varied from
8.21 to 17.28 μM; HepG2 and B16-F10 cells were found
to be more sensitive than other cancer cells as indicated by
their IC50 value (HepG2, 8.21 μM; B16-F10, 8.57 μM).
To determine the cytotoxicity of UA and US597
on normal human cells, we conducted MTT assay in L02
and HUVEC cells after administration with indicated

migration of HepG2 cells incubated with UA/US597 was
significantly decreased compared with the control.

HUVECs with UA/US597 for 24 h. Figure 3C showed
that US597 dose-dependently inhibited the mRNA
expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin. In addition, the
mRNA expression of VCAM-1 was significantly lower in
the US597 (5 μM) treated group than that in the control
group (P < 0.01). UA (5 μM) inhibited the induction of
ICAM-1 and E-selectin mRNA (P < 0.05), while the level
of VCAM-1 mRNA showed almost no change.
The effects of UA/US597 on the protein expression
by HUVECs of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin were
evaluated by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3A and
3B, US597 at as low as 0.2 μM significantly inhibited
ICAM-1 expression (88.05% of control, P < 0.05), but
only mildly reduced VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression

HepG2 cells, the effects of UA/US597 on the mRNA and
protein expression by HUVECs of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and

and western blot. The HUVECs were pretreated with

(92.66% and 93.39% of control respectively). High
concentration of US597 (5 μM) significantly inhibited
ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression (29.50%,
64.41% and 57.53% of control respectively, P < 0.01).
However, UA (5 μM) had no significant effect on cell
adhesion molecule expression.
To confirm whether UA/US597 could reduce
the expression of cell adhesion molecule, we further
evaluated the expression of cell adhesion molecule
in HUVEC cells by western blot (Figure 3D and 3E).
Pretreatment of the HUVECs with US597 at 0.2, 1 and
5 μM significantly inhibited ICAM-1 expression in a
dose-dependent manner by 82.59, 53.47 and 25.49%
(Figure 3D), respectively, compared to the control.
By comparison, E-selectin protein expression was
slightly down-regulated in HUVEC cells treated by

5 μM US597 or at 24 h (Figure 3E), but no significant
decrease at UA (5 μM) treated group. The result was
consistent with that obtained from the flow cytometric
analysis. In addition, we also found that 5 μM US597
obviously inhibited the P-selectin protein expression in
HUVECs (Figure 3E).

Analysis of microarray expression data
Considering the facts that UAs have been used in
the treatment of liver diseases [24], and hepatocellular
carcinoma cell line HepG2 also shows better sensitivity
to UA/US597 in vitro, we decided to focus on HepG2
cell line for the further underlying mechanism study. To
further assess the expression pattern of the genes after
HepG2 cells were treated with US597 (5 μM, 24 h), the

microarray analysis were performed using an Affymetrix
human U133plus 2.0 array. The microarray data showed
that the expressions of 720 genes were significantly altered
(≥ 1.5 fold change plus corrected t-test p-value < 0.1):
498 genes were up-regulated and 252 genes were downregulated (Supplementary Figure S2A, n = 3). As indicated
in Supplementary Figure S2B, these genes are mostly
associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and
signal transduction in response to US597 treatment. More

importantly, 13 genes were involved in the focal adhesion
signaling pathway—the key signaling pathway associated
with cancer metastasis (Figure 4A).
To validate the microarray results, we assessed
the expression of a subset of focal adhesion genes with
qRT-PCR, including: integrin α6 (ITGA 6), integrin
β1 (ITGB 1), FAK and PTEN (Figure 4B). The results
showed that obvious decreases in integrin α6, integrin β1,
FAK and up-regulated PTEN expression were observed in

manner at mRNA levels. Above results confirmed that the
microarray data were reliable.

UA/US597 can down-regulate the expression of proteins
associated with proliferation and metastasis.

Effect of UA/US597 on experimental lung
metastasis and survival

Molecular docking study on UA/US597
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), also named Proteintyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2), is the key regulator of UAsrelated proteins involved in focal adhesion pathway,
and also the key signal molecule associated with cancer
metastasis. To confirm whether UA/US597 could directly
inhibit the activity of FAK, molecular docking studies
were conducted using the FFT-base protein docking
method [25]. We found that UA could dock well into the
active site of FAK, which is the key protein involved in
cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion. As
show in Figure 4C and 4D, the docking data suggested
that binding of UA 2 to FAK involved 3 hydrogen bonds
Lys621, Arg508 and Glu430, UA also forms hydrophobic
interaction with residues Arg550, Ile428, Leu533, Leu567,
Glu506, Gly429 and Val436 in the active site of FAK.

After confirming that US597 can significantly
inhibited cancer cells adhesion, migration and invasion
in vitro, we further examined the anti-metastatic efficacy
of US597 with a murine artificial pulmonary metastases
model in vivo. The experimental protocol is depicted in
Figure 6A.
Figure 6B (a) showed representative images of
pulmonary metastases of B16-F10 melanoma in each
treatment group. It was obvious that the mice treated with
the US597 showed less pulmonary metastatic nodules than
those of mice in control group. Histological examinations
showed the presence of melanoma cells in the lung
parenchyma, which proved the presence of metastasis
(Figure 6B (b)). In addition, the hematoxylin–eosin
staining of various lung sections further confirmed that
the metastatic nodules colonized in the lungs of US597
treated groups were smaller than that of saline treated
group (Figure 6B (b)).
Quantification analysis of the number of nodules
was shown in Figure 6C. After 28 days treatment with
US597 with 20, 40 or 80 mg/kg/day, the inhibitory
rates were 28.31%, 44.58% and 60.24%, respectively.
Furthermore, there was no obvious effect on body weights
change (Figure 6D) at these dose levels. By comparison,
a weaker inhibition (14.45%) was found in UA treatment
group. In summary, these results manifested that US597
could efficiently suppress the tumor lung metastasis in
vivo without obvious side effects in mice.
In addition, the life span of these animals was
significantly increased by UA/US597 treatment (80 mg/
kg/day). The control animals survived for 8 weeks after
inoculation of B16-F10 murine melanoma cells. Animals
treated with US597 survived for more than 12 weeks
(Figure 6E).

UA/US597 inhibit the integrin α6 and β1
expression in HepG2 cells
To demonstrate the effect that UA/US597 inhibits
the highly expressed adhesion molecules in HepG2
cells, the expressions of α4, α5, α6 and β1 integrin on
the surface of HepG2 cells altered by UA/US597 were
determined by FACS. Cells were exposed to UA (5 μM)
and different concentrations of US597 (0.2, 1 and 5 μM)
for 24 h, then used flow cytometry analysis to validate
the different levels of protein expression of integrin
subunits α6 and β1 (Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5B,
when the HepG2 cells were treated with 0.2, 1 and 5 μM
US597, integrin α6 fluorescence intensity were inhibited
by 13.95%, 45.33% and 62.52%, respectively, and also
caused a significant decrease in integrin β1 expression by
7.92, 38.64, and 71.72%, respectively. In contrast, there
were no significant changes in the fluorescence intensity
of the α4 (Supplementary Figure S3A) and α5 integrin
(Supplementary Figure S3B).

Histopathological and blood analysis
Our aforementioned results demonstrated that
80  mg/kg UA/US597 by daily oral administration for
28  days, UA/US597 did not induce significant animal
body loss. Hence, this dose was chosen to investigate
whether UA/US597 can protect against systematic toxicity
in vivo.
After 28 days, normal tissues, such as heart, liver,
spleen, kideney and small intestine histopathological
photomicrographs were shown in Figure 7. Histological
features of control group mouse showed normal structures.
Moreover, main viscera tissues including heart, liver,
spleen, kidney and small intestine show no remarkable
histopathological abnormalities or lesions in UA/US597
treated group.

UA/US597 inhibit integrin-mediated focal
adhesion signaling pathway
Because integrin-mediated focal adhesion signaling
pathway can influence various processes of tumor cells
proliferation, adhesion, invasion and migration, we
detected six major groups of proteins including integrin
α6, integrin β1, FAK, Src, paxillin and PTEN to detect the
effect of UA/US597 on integrin-mediated focal adhesion
signaling pathway. As shown in Figure 5C, US597 clearly
reduced integrin α6, integrin β1 and downstream FAK, Src
and paxillin, up-regulated expression of PTEN in HepG2
in a concentration-dependent manner. When UA was
treated, the effect was prominent. Our results showed that

At the end of the study, the blood toxicity analysis
of mice indicated that white blood cell count and
lymphocytes decreased significantly in UA/US597 group
compared with control group, hemoglobin and platelets
were changed in the US597 treated mice compared with
the saline treated mice (Table 1). However, all the cell
counts remained in the reported normal ranges.

ICAM-1 expression was appreciably enhanced in
endothelial cells of blood vessels in the control group.
Compared with the control group, there was no significant
changes in the low dose US597 group (P > 0.05 Figure 8B).
The expressions of ICAM-1 were significantly decreased in
the UA and high dose US597 group (P < 0.01 Figure 8B).

US597 may be hydrolyzed by amidase to produce the

DISCUSSION

the mice, and the US597 was observed very well. The key
pharmacokinetic parameters of US597 were calculated
and summarized in Supplementary Table 1. These
results suggested that US597 was mainly distributed in
vasculature after oral administration and hydrolyzed by
amidase to produce the metabolized product UA in vivo,
at last eliminated slowly from the body.

In the current work, we reported for the first time the
effect of UA and its novel derivative US597 on the heteroadhesion between human hepatocellular carcinoma cells
and endothelial cells. Several studies have documented the
anti-cancer activity of UA and its derivatives [20–22]. In the

present studies, we showed that US597 had a potential role
in inhibiting the growth, adhesion, invasion and migration
of SW620, B16-F10 and HepG2 cells in vitro, as well
as suppressed cancer metastasis in vivo by the B16-F10/
C57BL/6 mouse melanoma lung metastasis model,
suggesting its potential anti-metastasis effect by modulating
tumor adhesion and invasion steps both in vitro and in vivo.
Further study showed that the mechanism underlying the
above effects of US597 was related, at least in part, to the
inhibitory cell-surface CAMs and integrin α6β1 expression
in HUVECs and HepG2 cells, respectively.
Metastasis, one of the major causes of morbidity
and mortality in cancer patients, is strongly influenced
by tumor cell adhesion, migration, and invasion [26].
Adhesion of cancer cells to ECM or vascular endothelium
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is a crucial starting point of metastasis. Therefore,
therapeutic strategies for preventing or suppressing
cancer adhesion and metastasis can significantly improve
the survival of cancer patients. We found that UA/
US597 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in all
nine cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure S1). In order to exclude the possible
cell cytotoxicity activity, we determined the UA/US597
anti-adhesion, migration and invasion activity at the dose
without obvious cytotoxicity (the concentrations lower
than its IC50). In the present studies, we demonstrated
that UA/US597 could interfere adhesion of HepG2 cells to
HUVECs (Figure 2A and 2B) in a concentration dependent
manner. Furthermore, tumor migration and invasion, a
common feature of tumor cells, are becoming important
9305

prerequisites of cancer progression and metastasis [27].
We showed that UA/US597 markedly inhibited the
invasive (Figure 2C) and migratory (Figure 2D) abilities of
HepG2 cells. In addition, UA/US597 also can inhibit the
adhesion, migration and invasion of SW620 and B16-F10
cells at low concentrations. Collectively, the results
suggested that UA/US597 could inhibit the adhesion
of HepG2 cells to endothelial cells, thus preventing the
formation of metastatic foci in the distant organs.
The adhesive interaction between tumor cells and
vascular endothelial cells or the extracellular matrix plays
a crucial role in metastasis formation. These interactions
are mediated by several specific adhesion receptors, such as
cellular adhesion molecules, integrins and cadherins [28]. It
has become apparent that the expression of cellular adhesion
molecules plays a major role in the hetero-adhesion between
tumor cells and the vascular endothelial cells over the past
few years [3]. Previous studies have shown that various
cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-β) and interleukin-1β (IL1β), may stimulate the expression of CAMs (ICAM-1,
VCAM-1, E-selectin and P-selectin) by human umbilical
vein endothelial cells with different potency [29, 30]. We
chose the most potent cytokine IL-1β (1 ng/mL) [29] as a
tool molecule in the present study to investigate the effect
of UA/US597 on CAMs expression in HUVECs. We found
that UA/US597 inhibited the expression of VCAM-1,
ICAM-1 and E-selectin in HUVEC cells both at the protein
and mRNA levels induced by IL-1β in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 3), indicating that impaired adhesion of
HepG2 cells to HUVECs activity may resulted from the
downregulation of CAMs expression in HUVECs.
Tumor invasion and metastasis involve multiple
processes, which depend on specific cell-to-cell and cell-

to-ECM (extracellular matrix) interactions. These events
are mediated in part by integrins that act as receptors for
ECM proteins [31]. Integrins are cell-surface glycoprotein
receptors that consist of alpha and beta subunits. During
cancer metastasis, the expression levels of many different
integrins are up-regulated, such as α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α5β1
and α6β1 [10–12, 32, 33]. Among these, the integrin α6β1,
a receptor for laminins, is thought to exclusively bind
laminin and to mediate adhesion of human hepatocellular
carcinoma cells on substrata coated with this protein
[11, 12]. There are reports showing that blocking the
expression and activity of integrin α6β1 and its downstream
signaling regulator can significantly inhibit hepatocellular
carcinoma metastasis [34], which may be related with the
inhibition of tumor adhesion, migration, and invasion. In
our microarray results, we found 720 genes were altered
after US597 treatment (Supplementary Figure S2). Some
selected genes were categorized according to their known
function. Among them, 13 genes were associated with the
focal adhesion, including FAK and PTEN (Figure 4A).
We investigated the expression of ITGA6, ITGB1, FAK and
PTEN mRNA after UA/US597 treatment of HepG2 cells
by qRT-PCR (Figure 4B). In addition, structural docking
presents a possible binding mode of UA in the FAK active
site (Figure 4C and 4D). In this study, we also examined
the inhibition effects of UA/US597 on the expression of
integrins (α6β1) and downstream FAK, Src, paxillin and upregulates PTEN on the surface of HepG2 cells (Figure 5).
UA/US597 is able to modulate the expression of proteins
linked to proliferation, adhesion, invasion and migration in
HepG2 cells (Figure 9). Taken together, our data suggested
that the anti-metastatic effect of UA/US597 may be mediated
by suppressing the integrin α6β1 and its downstream
signaling regulator expression on the cancer cell surface.

A vast majority of previous studies proved that
UA and its derivatives could inhibit tumor initiation,
growth and progression in a wide variety of preclinical
cancer models [17, 35]. Whereas few studies showed
that UAs exerted anti-tumor metastasis activity [21,
36]. In our animal study, the anti-metastasis effects
of UA/US597 were investigated in a mouse model of
established pulmonary metastasis. Tumor metastasis
inhibitory effect in mice bearing B16-F10 cells could
predict the activity of corresponding tumors in human
beings, which closely mimics the stage of metastasis in
a lot of human’s cancers [37]. The present study clearly
showed that the daily administration of UA/US597
resulted in remarkable reduction of lung metastasis
(Figure 6B and 6C) and significantly down-regulated
ICAM-1 protein expression (Figure 8A and 8B) in vivo
with a dose-dependent manner. Besides, there is no
significant difference between UA/US597 treated and
untreated control group in body weights (Figure 6D) and
main viscera tissues and blood counts did not exhibit
significant abnormalities or lesions (Figure 7 and Table
1). In addition, the Kaplan–Meier estimate showed that
the mean survival rates versus time of UA/US597 treated
mice were significantly higher than those of the untreated
mice (Figure 6E). UA/US597 has the convenience of oral
administration, favorable pharmacokinetic properties
(Figure 8C and Supplementary Table 1). It was the first
time that the UA/US597 was demonstrated to be not only
effective in inhibiting melanoma lung metastasis, but
also low toxicity to the hosts. UA/US597 may be a safe
and effective potential therapeutic agent for patients with
early cancer metastasis.

Adhesion assay

Flow cytometry

We used the fluorescence microscope photographed
method to evaluate effects of UA/US597 on the antiadhesion. HUVECs were grown to confluence in 24well culture plates, pretreated with gelatin for 12 h, and
stimulated with IL-1β for 4 h. Rhodamine 123-labeled
SW620, B16-F10 and HepG2 cells were co-cultured
with the HUVECs monolayers in each well, followed by
treatment with UA/US597 for 1 hour. The non-adherent
HepG2 cells were removed from the plate by washing
with PBS, and the tumor cells bound to the HUVECs were
measured by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Germany),
we randomly selected 10 visual fields for each well and
took pictures under a fluorescence microscope. The total
number of 10 visual fields was calculated by using the
equation: % adhesion rate of the control = [the number of
adhered cells in samples/the number of adhered cells in the
control group] × 100%.

Cells expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin,
integrin α4, α5, α6 and β1 were performed via flow
cytometry. Briefly, HUVECs were plated in 6-well plates,
grown to 80% confluence, and then pretreated with IL1β (1 ng/mL) for 4 h, and then incubation with different
concentrations of UA/US597 for 24 h. HepG2 cells were
grown on 6-well tissue culture plates followed by treatment
with different concentration of UA/US597 for 24 h. After
incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS and
collected for staining. The cells and primary antibodies were
incubated at 4°C for 20 min in the dark. After washing with
staining buffer, cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1, VCAM-1
and E-selectin) and integrins (integrin α6 and β1) expression
on cell-surface were measured by BD FACSAriaIII flow
cytometry. The data were processed by FlowJo software and
expressed as the mean fluorescent intensities.

Western blotting analysis

Invasion assay

HepG2 and HUVECs (pretreated with 1 ng/mL
IL-1β for 4 h) cells were treated for 24 h with various
concentrations of US597 (0.2, 1 and 5 μM) and 5 μM UA.
Cell dishes were washed with cold phosphate-buffered
saline and treated with lysis buffer for several seconds
at an ice-cold bath, and then cell lysates were clarified
by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 5 min under 4°C and
the supernatants were recovered. The concentrations of
proteins were determined by the BCA method. Samples
with equivalent amounts of proteins were resolved by
SDS-PAGE using a 10% gel. Proteins were transferred
to a polyvinyldene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The
membranes were washed for ten minutes with TBS (20
mM Tris, 160 mM NaCl) and were blocked by blocking
solution (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 125 mM NaCl, 0.1%
Tween 20, and 5% skim milk). The blots were washed
three times with TBST(20 mM Tris, 160 mM NaCl,
0.1% Tween 20), and they were incubated with specific
primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in TBST solution
overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the blots were washed
three times with TBST (20 mM Tris, 160 mM NaCl,
0.1% Tween 20), and then the blots were incubated with
secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase conjugated
goat anti-rabbit-IgG) diluted 1:5000 in TBST solution for
2 h at 37°C. The membranes were washed with TBST and
TBS. Chemiluminescent signals were generated using
a Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate
kit (Pierce), and detected by using the ChemiDoc
XRS system (Bio-Rad). The target proteins expression
was quantified by use of Image Lab analysis software
(Bio-Rad).

An invasion assay was carried out using 24-well
plate. The 8 μM pore-sized transwell inserts were coated
with matrigel at 1 mg/mL on the upper chamber. The lower
chamber was filled with medium containing 20% FBS as
chemoattractant agents. The coated filter and upper chamber
were laid over the lower chamber. SW620, B16−F10 and
HepG2 cells were resuspended with reduced serum RPMI
1640 medium and the density was adjusted to 2.5 × 105/
mL, and then cell suspension (200 μL) containing different
concentrations of UA (5 μM) or US597 (0.2, 1, 5 μM) were
seeded onto the upper chamber wells. After incubation for
24 h at 37°C, cells were fixed in methanol for 20 min. The
cells on the inner layer were softly removed with a cotton
swab, and the adherent cells on undersurface of the insert
were stained with 0.1% crystal violet dye for 15 min. The
filters were washed with PBS and images were taken. The
invading cells were counted and photographed under a
light microscope (Zeiss, Germany) at × 200 magnification.
Five fields were counted per filter in each group and the
experiment was conducted in triplicate.

Migration assay
SW620, B16-F10 and HepG2 cells (5 × 105 cells per
well) were plated in 6-well plates for 24 h, a perpendicular
scratch wound was generated by scratching with a 10 μL
pipette tip. After rinsing with PBS to remove the detached
cells, then incubated with RPMI-1640 medium containing
0.5% FBS and treated with or without UA/US597 for 0 and
24 h. Cells were photographed using a light microscope
(Zeiss, Germany) at 0 and 24 h after the drug treatment.
The distance that cells migrated through the scribed area
was determined by measuring the wound width at 24 h
after treatment, and subtracting it from the wound width at
0 h. Experiments were repeated at least three times.

The crystal structure of FAK (PTK2) was used as the
docking proteins [40]. The docking experiment was
carried out by using DFT/6–31G in Gaussian 09 [41].
All parameters were calculated with the default protocols
unless otherwise noted.

Microarray assay of gene expression

In vivo tumor growth and metastasis assay

HepG2 cells were cultured in medium containing
5 μM US597 for 24 h, and cells incubated in medium
without US597 acted as a control. Total RNA was
extracted from HepG2 cells (2 × 106) using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) and mRNA microarray analyses using
Affymetrix GeneChip U133plus2.0 Array (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA) were performed according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Microarrays were scanned by
using Affymetrix® GeneChip Command Console (AGCC)
which installed in GeneChip® Scanner 3000. The data
were analyzed with Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA)
algorithm using default analysis settings and global scaling

To establish the lung metastasis model, B16-F10
cells were harvested, washed with serum-free RPMI 1640
and resuspended to give the appropriate concentrations
in PBS, and injected into the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice
at a density of 5 × 104/200 μL. On the following day
(Day  1), mice were randomly divided into five groups
(n = 14 for each group), and then they were orally gavaged
with either normal saline (control), UA (80 mg/kg) and
US597 (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) for 28 days, respectively.
Mice weight was measured every four days for 7 times.
Mice were sacrificed (n = 6) at the 28st days after tumor
inoculation. The heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and
small intestine were excised, washed with PBS, and fixed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and these tissues were
then paraffin embeddedand stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E). The number of surface tumor nodules
was determined by visual inspection using a magnifying
glass, and histological observations were performed under
a microscope (Zeiss, Germany). The other eight animals
were observed for more than 12 weeks (D 90) for a
determination of survival rate in control and UA/US597
treated groups, respectively.

Total RNA isolation and quantitative
real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells in control
group and UA/US597 treated groups at different
concentrations, using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A sample (1
μg) of total RNA was used for the synthesis of the first
strand cDNA using the PrimeScript® RT reagent Kit
(Takara, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The PCR was carried out with 1μL cDNA

cells are shown as × 200 magnification.

Pharmacokinetic assessments
The pharmacokinetic properties of US597 were
investigated in male Sprague–Dawley rats (Shanghai
Laboratory Animal Center). On the study day, the
rats received an 80 mg/kg dose of US597 by oral
administration. The pharmacokinetic study involved
serial arterial blood sampling (500 μL) with 13 samples
obtained from each animal at 0.17, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67,
1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after administration. The
plasma concentrations were determined by UPLCMS/MS analysis (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA).
Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, the present study for the first time
demonstrated that UA and its novel derivative US597 were
able to suppress cell surface adhesive molecules including
ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and P-selectin proteins
expression, and further target integrin α6β1-mediated focal
adhesion signaling pathway (Figure 9), and resulted in
inhibiting adhesion and migration of cancer cells in vitro
and in vivo. More importantly, UA/US597 has low toxicity
to the hosts. These findings confirmed that UA and US597
were novel promising anti-metastasis drugs, particularly
as new potential chemopreventive agents for suppressing
hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence and early metastasis.
