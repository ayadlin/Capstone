ABSTRACT
The deregulation of lipid metabolism is a hallmark of tumor cells, and elevated
lipogenesis has been reported in prostate cancer. Metformin, a drug commonly
prescribed for type II diabetes, displays antitumor properties. Here, we show that
metformin inhibits lipogenesis in several prostate cancer cell lines. In LNCaP cells, this
effect parallels the decrease of key lipogenic proteins: ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase),
FASN (fatty acid synthase) and SREBP1c (sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c),
whereas there is no modification in DU145 and PC3 cells. Despite the relatively high
level of lipogenic proteins induced by the overexpression of a constitutively active form
of SREBP1c or treatment with androgens, metformin is still able to inhibit lipogenesis.
Metformin does not alter the concentration of malonyl-CoA (the fatty acid precursor),
and it only slightly decreases the NADPH levels, which is a co-factor required for
lipogenesis, in LNCaP. Finally, we show that the inhibitory effect of metformin on
lipogenesis is primarily due to a cellular energy deficit. Metformin decreases ATP in
a dose-dependent manner, and this diminution is significantly correlated with the
inhibition of lipogenesis in LNCaP and DU145. Indeed, the effect of metformin is
linked to changes in the ATP content rather than the regulation of protein expression.
Our results describe a new mechanism of action for metformin on prostate cancer
metabolism.

early and late stages of the disease. The deregulation of
lipid metabolism, or more specifically, the increased rate
of lipogenesis, is essential to maintain the tumor cells
growth rate, and inhibitors of lipid synthesis have been
shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation [3]. Fatty acid
synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)
are two key enzymes that regulate lipogenesis. ACC
catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA,
the precursor of newly synthesized fatty acids, and its
activity is negatively regulated by its phosphorylation by
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Sterol Regulatory
Element-Binding Protein 1c (SREBP1c) controls the
expression of FASN, which catalyzes the synthesis of fatty
acids from malonyl-CoA. Androgens and the Akt/mTOR
pathway have been shown to stimulate lipogenesis through
the direct control of the expression of SREBP1c, FASN
and ACC.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death
by cancer in men. Most prostate cancer-related deaths are
due to advanced stages of the disease and the formation
of metastases. Patients with metastatic prostate cancer
initially respond to anti-androgen therapy for a median
time of 12 to 18 months [1] and then become resistant to
the treatment. Unfortunately, chemotherapeutic treatments
display modest results, with a median survival of 18 months
in patients treated with docetaxel [2]; therefore, there
is an urgent need for additional therapy. In the era of
targeted therapy, there is a growing interest in drugs
targeting metabolic pathways. The tumor growth phase
is characterized by a high metabolic demand. Prostate
tumors activate glycolysis in the advanced stages,
whereas an increase in lipogenesis is observed during the

Metformin is a widely used anti-diabetic drug
prescribed to more than 120 million people worldwide
[4, 5]. In agreement with retrospective epidemiological
studies, diabetic patients treated with metformin display
a reduction in their cancer incidence and cancerrelated mortality [6–9]. Metformin inhibits cancer cell
proliferation and decreases tumor growth in many animal
models [10–13]. In addition, metformin sensitizes tumor
cells to classical anti-cancer agents, such as disatinib [14].
Metformin alters cancer cell metabolism and it inhibits
mitochondrial complex 1 and the mTOR pathway, which
is a major regulator of cell metabolism and proliferation.
However, the role of metformin on lipid metabolism in
cancer cells is poorly understood.
Here, we show that metformin exerts a strong
inhibitory effect on lipogenesis in prostate cancer cells.
The overexpression of a constitutively active form of
SREBP1c, as well as androgen treatment, increases the
expression of FASN and ACC and strongly stimulates
lipogenesis. Nevertheless, metformin hampers this
effect. Finally, we demonstrate that metformin does
not affect the malonyl-CoA or NADPH content but
instead induces an energy deficiency that impairs
lipogenesis.

fatty acids and triglycerides as described in the material
and methods. Metformin inhibited the lipogenesis in
the three cancer cell lines, with a stronger effect in the
LNCaP cells (80% inhibition) after 24 h, and a reduction
of 75 and 50% was observed in PC3 and DU145,
respectively (Fig. 1). To confirm these observations,
we incubated the cells with [3H] glucose, one of the
precursors of fatty acids. Despite the fact that metformin
increases glucose uptake in prostate cancer cells [17],
we showed that it inhibits lipogenesis using the labeled
glucose (Fig. S1). We also found that phenformin, a
biguanide and analogue of metformin, strongly inhibits
lipogenesis (Fig. S2). These results highlight the strong
inhibitory effect of biguanides on the lipogenesis in
prostate cancer cells.
Metformin activates AMPK, which phosphorylates
and inhibits ACC, and metformin downregulates
mTORC1, which controls the expression of SREBP1c.
We asked whether the effects of metformin on
lipogenesis are related to a decrease in the expression
of these lipogenic proteins. We analyzed the expression
of SREBP1c, FASN and ACC (Fig. 2A). As expected,
metformin induces the phosphorylation of ACC at Ser79,
and it induces a strong decrease in the SREBP1c and
FASN mRNA and proteins in the LNCaP cells, but it
did not alter the expression of the ACC proteins after
24 h (Fig. 2B, 2C). We also analyzed the SREBP1c
activity via transient transfections of a FASN promoterluciferase reporter plasmid containing the SREBP1c
responsive element. Consistent with the inhibitory effect
of metformin, we found that the SREBP1c activity was
drastically reduced in the LNCaP cells treated with
metformin (Fig. S3).
Interestingly, although we still observed the
phosphorylation of ACC at Ser79, we did not observe any

induces the phosphorylation of ACC on this residue
(Fig. 2, 3). To obtain insights into the molecular events
implicated in the rapid action of metformin on lipogenesis,
we analyzed the malonyl-CoA concentration. A strong
activator of AMPK, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
ribonucleotide (AICAR), was used as a control to inhibit
the ACC activity. The AICAR significantly decreased the
malonyl-CoA concentration, whereas the metformin had
no effect in the LNCaP and DU145 cell lines (Fig. 5A).
Lipogenesis requires 12 NADPH molecules to
synthesize 1 fatty acid molecule. In order to determine
whether metformin alters the NADPH levels, we
assessed the NADPH content in the prostate cancer cells.
An inhibitor of glycolysis, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG),
significantly decreased the NADPH concentration in the
LNCaP and DU145 cells. No change in the NADPH was
observed in DU145, and the metformin induced a slight
but significant decrease in the LNCaP cells (Fig. 5B). Our
results indicate that the inhibitory action of metformin is
not due to the decrease of malonyl-CoA or NADPH.

and the decrease in the ATP concentration. Interestingly,
the decrease in the ATP content was significantly
correlated with the inhibitory effect of the metformin on
lipogenesis, with an R2 = 0.775 in LNCaP and 0.798 in
DU145 (Fig. 6A, 6B).
To highlight the importance of the energetic state
of the cell in the control of lipogenesis, we treated
the cells with rotenone, which is a strong inhibitor of
complex 1 and decreases the ATP content [17]. Similar to
metformin, increasing the concentration of rotenone (from
5 to 50 μM) induces a decrease in the ATP concentration,
which parallels the inhibition of lipogenesis (Fig. S4).
Together, our results suggest that the effect of metformin
on lipogenesis in prostate cancer cells is linked to changes
in the ATP content rather than regulation of the protein
expression.

DISCUSSION
The anti-diabetic drug metformin has received
significant attention lately because of its anti-tumoral
action [21]. Depending on the cancer cell type, metformin
induces either cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis or autophagy.
These cellular effects are associated with major alterations
in the cellular metabolism. Metformin acts as a calorierestriction agent, which forces cells to adapt their
metabolism to minimize energy-consuming reactions
and optimize energy-producing pathways. For example,
metformin, through the inhibition of mTOR, decreases
protein synthesis, thus providing a mechanism of action
for metformin in the inhibition of cancer-cell proliferation
[22]. Similarly, the inhibition of lipogenesis may also be
implicated in the anti-proliferative effects of metformin.
Indeed, lipogenesis plays a major role in cell proliferation
because it generates lipids for the formation of the neosynthetized membranes of rapidly dividing cells. The

Metformin induces an energy deficiency state in
prostate cancer
Lipogenesis is an energy-demanding process,
which consumes 7 molecules of ATP per molecule of
palmitate produced [20]. We have shown that metformin
inhibits complex 1 of the mitochondrial respiratory chain
and decreases the ATP concentration in prostate cancer
cells [17]. To evaluate the potential of metformin to affect
the energetic state of prostate cancer cells, we assessed the
ATP concentration in the LNCaP and DU145 cells after
treatment with different concentrations of metformin. The
metformin induced a dose-dependent decrease in the ATP
content in both cell lines (Fig. 6A). We then asked whether
a correlation exists between the inhibition of lipogenesis

increase in lipogenesis is associated with a poor prognosis,
tumor growth and aggressiveness, especially in prostate
cancer [23].
Targeted therapies using FASN inhibitors, such
as C75, decrease the cancer cell proliferation and tumor
growth and may offer new therapeutic opportunities
for cancer [24, 25]. Androgens drive prostate cancer
carcinogenesis and progression, even in androgenindependent tumors where the androgen receptor signaling
remains active. Interfering with the androgen receptor
pathway is the gold standard for androgen-sensitive
tumors and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CPRC).
Drugs such as MDV3100 and abiraterone (an inhibitor
of androgen synthesis) have provided encouraging
results; however, resistance to these agents has recently
emerged [26]. Androgen-induced lipogenesis is enhanced
during the emergence of androgen independence and
contributes to the growth of castration-resistant prostate
cancer cells [19].
Lipogenesis is controlled by several proteins,
and we demonstrated that metformin decreases the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

FASN, SREBP1c and ACC expression in LNCaP cells.
This is in accordance with previous studies showing
that the alteration of SREBP1c affects lipogenesis
[27, 28]. Recently, Yecies et al. deciphered the
molecular mechanism implicated in this regulation and
demonstrated that Akt stimulates hepatic SREBP1c
through mTOR dependent and independent pathways [29].
AMPK negatively regulates mTOR; it phosphorylates
SREBP1c and inhibits its activity to diminish hepatic
fatty acid accumulation [30]. Other studies in cancer
cells demonstrated that targeting AMPK/mTOR inhibits
lipogenesis. MT63–78, a novel selective activator of
AMPK, decreases prostate tumor growth and inhibits
FASN and SREBP1c expression, and the anti-growth
effects of this activator are mediated by the inhibition of
lipogenesis [31]. Metformin is an activator of AMPK and
an inhibitor of mTOR, and it decreases the expression of
FASN and SREBP1c in colonic tumors from mice fed a
high-energy diet [32]. Similarly, metformin affected the
expression of hepatic FASN and ACC in mice treated with
the potent liver carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN).

Figure 6: Metformin induces a state of energy deficiency, which correlates with a decrease in lipogenesis. (A, B) LNCaP
and DU145 were treated with increasing concentrations of metformin (0.25 to 5 mM). The ATP content (left panel), expressed as the % of
the control, and lipogenesis were monitored. The correlation between the lipogenesis and the ATP content is shown in the left panel. The
results are representative of three independent experiments.

In the same study, the overexpression of a constitutively
active form of SREBP1c induced the expression of
lipogenic genes and reversed the antiproliferative effects
of metformin in several hepatocellular carcinoma cell
lines. However, there is no evidence in this study of
the restoration of functional lipogenesis. Here, we
demonstrated that despite the relatively high level of
lipogenic proteins induced by the overexpression of
SREBP1c or androgen treatment, the metformin was still
able to hamper lipogenesis.
The major source of NADPH in animals is the
pentose phosphate pathway, and an increase in glucose
consumption stimulates this pathway. Metformin increases
glucose uptake in cancer cells [17]; therefore, we were
not expecting a decrease in the NADPH concentration.
Instead, we showed that NADPH is not altered in DU145,
and it is slightly decreased in LNCaP. Therefore, NADPH
does not appear to be the limiting factor responsible for
the inhibition of lipogenesis, at least in DU145.
Another limiting factor of lipogenesis is the
concentration of malonyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA produces
malonyl-CoA, which is converted to palmitic acid by
FASN. ACC regulates the synthesis of malonyl-CoA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from acetyl-CoA, and its activity is inhibited by AMPK
through its phosphorylation at Ser79. We demonstrated
that metformin does not affect the malonyl-CoA content.
Although the activation of AMPK (inhibition of ACC)
decreases the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, we can expect
that the inhibition of the later stages of lipogenesis induces
an accumulation of malonyl-CoA, as demonstrated by Fritz
et al. [3]. In addition, in response to metformin, prostate
cancer cells were shown to increase their dependence on
reductive glutamine metabolism [33]. This pathway leads
to the formation of acetyl-CoA, the substrate of ACC,
suggesting that the net result of the metformin action is
an equilibrium between the accumulation of malonyl-CoA
and a partial inhibition of its synthesis.
Metformin inhibits complex 1 of the mitochondrial
respiratory chain in intact hepatocytes and cancer cells
[17, 34], resulting in a decrease in the ATP concentration
and a state of energy deficiency in the cells. In response
to this energetic stress, cells increase their glucose
consumption and upregulate glycolysis to produce
ATP [17, 35]. They also increase their dependence on
reductive glutamine metabolism [33]. This pathway
provides alpha-ketoglutarate to the TCA cycle to generate
15658

Oncotarget

succinate, which is oxidized by complex 2, and therefore
bypasses complex 1 of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain. These compensatory mechanisms are essential to
avoid the induction of apoptosis. We demonstrated that
the combination of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), an inhibitor
of glycolysis, and metformin leads to the depletion of
ATP and cell death [17]. Similarly, the decrease in the
glutamine flux sensitizes cells to the anti-proliferative
action of metformin [33].
The exact mechanism involved in the inhibition of
complex 1 by metformin is not well understood, but it is
well established that the inhibition of gluconeogenesis
in hepatocytes results from a disruption of the energy
metabolism [36, 37]. This result is supported by the
correlation observed between the reduction of the
ATP/ADP level in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis in
hepatocytes [36]. It is worth noting that the ATP level
was significantly reduced in primary hepatocytes treated
with 0.25 mM of metformin, and a higher concentration
induced a stronger decrease. In accordance with
these results, we showed that metformin induces a
decrease in the ATP level in a dose-dependent manner,
which significantly correlates with the inhibition of
lipogenesis.
Our work highlights a new function for metformin in
its anti-tumoral action. In addition, as a calorie-restricting
agent, it unravels a direct relationship between the energy
status of the cells and the fatty acid synthesis.

The medium was replaced and the cells were then
treated and used for western analysis, lipogenesis and
proliferation experiments.

Western blotting
The cell extracts were prepared using lysis buffer
[15], and the immunoblotting was performed using
antibodies against ACC (Cell Signaling Technology);
Ser79 P-ACC (Millipore), FASN and HSP90 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); SREBP1c (BD Biosciences); and
α-tubulin (Sigma Chemical Co.).

Quantification of the lipogenesis
Subconfluent cell cultures were grown in 6-well
plates and treated with 5 mM metformin for 24 h. The
cultures were then incubated with [3H] acetate (0.2 μCi/ml)
for 1 h. The incorporation of [3H] acetate into the lipids was
measured at the end of the incubation after the addition of
toluene-based scintillation fluid [16]. The counts per minute
(cpm) were normalized to the protein content in the total
cell lysate.

Malonyl-CoA quantification

The cell lines were purchased from the ATCC
(Manassas, VA, USA). The LNCaP cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium, and the PC-3 and DU145 cells
were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
containing 25 mmol/L glucose supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/mL penicillin at
37°C and 5% CO2.

The quantification of the malonyl-CoA
concentration in the whole-cell lysates from the LNCaP
and DU145 cells was performed via an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay using a commercial kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Antibodies online.com).
Briefly, subconfluent cell cultures grown in 6-well plates
were treated, and the whole-cell lysates were subjected
to several freeze-thaw cycles and then centrifuged. The
malonyl-CoA in the supernatant was detected using
a specific biotin-conjugated antibody on pre-coated 96well plates and was revealed with avidin-conjugated
horseradish peroxidase. The values are expressed in
nanomoles of malonyl-CoA and are normalized to the total
protein content.

from Calbiochem (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). R1881
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved
in DMSO.

The cells were treated with 5 mM metformin or
20 mM 2-deoxyglucose for 24 h. The quantification
of the NADPH concentration in the whole-cell
