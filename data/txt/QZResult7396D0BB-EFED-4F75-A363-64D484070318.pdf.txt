Abstract
Posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation and
ubiquitination, play critical regulatory roles in the assembly of DNA damage response
proteins on the DNA damage site and their activities in DNA damage repair. Tyrosyl
DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) repairs Topoisomerase 2 (Top2)-linked DNA
damage, thereby protecting cancer cells against Top2 inhibitors-induced growth
inhibition and cell death. The regulation of TDP2 activity by post-translational
modifications in DNA repair, however, remains unclear. In the current study, we
have found that ERK3, an atypical MAPK, phosphorylates TDP2 at S60 and regulates
TDP2’s phosphodiesterase activity, thereby cooperatively protecting lung cancer cells
against Top2 inhibitors-induced DNA damage and growth inhibition. As such, our
study revealed a post-translational regulation of TDP2 activity and discovered a new
role of ERK3 in increasing cancer cells’ DNA damage response and chemoresistance
to Top2 inhibitors.

Introduction

as phosphorylation and ubiquitination play critical roles
in DNA damage repair by regulating the recruitment of
DNA damage repair proteins, their enzymatic activities
and the assembly and stability of the DNA damage repair
complex [8]. For example, the activity and functions of
tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), a 3’-tyrosyl
DNA phosphodiesterase, are tightly regulated by several
PTMs, including ATM-dependent phosphorylation [9,
10] and sumoylation [11]. By contrast to TDP1, the
posttranslational regulation of TDP2 activity remains
unknown.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) is
an atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
[12, 13]. In contrast with the well-studied conventional
MAPKs, such as ERK1/2, much less is known regarding
the activation and regulation of ERK3 signaling [14]. A
gain of interests on ERK3 has been seen owing to recent
important findings on its physiological and pathological
roles in lung. ERK3 knockout mice display intrauterine

Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2),
originally designated as TRAF and TNF receptorassociated protein (TTRAP), [1] and ETS1-associated
protein II (EAPII), [2], was recently revealed as a (and
the first) human 5’-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase
[3]. It hydrolyzes the phosphotyrosyl bond between
topoisomerase 2 (Top2) and DNA and repairs Top2-linked
DNA double-strand break that can be greatly enhanced by
Top2 inhibitors such as doxorubicin and etoposide [3-5].
As such, TDP2 protects cells against Top2 inhibitorsinduced DNA damage, growth inhibition and apoptosis,
thereby conferring chemoresistance. In line with this,
TDP2 has been shown to be overexpressed in lung cancer
[6, 7] and knockdown of TDP2 remarkably increases lung
cancer cells’ sensitivity to Top2 inhibitors, underscoring
the importance of targeting TDP2 enzyme in clinic
treatment. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such

growth restriction and neonatal lethality primarily due to
defect in functional differentiation of the lung [15]. Our
recent study revealed that ERK3 is upregulated in human
lung tumours and promotes lung cancer cell invasiveness
both in vitro and in vivo [16]. Our knowledge of ERK3
kinase’s targets is still limited. To date, MAPK-activated
protein kinase 5 (MK5), [17-18], steroid receptor
coactivator-3 (SRC-3), [16] and Borgs [19] are the only
known substrates of ERK3.
In the current study, we identified TDP2 as a
novel substrate of ERK3. ERK3 phosphorylates TDP2
and promotes its phosphodiesterase activity, thereby
upregualting TDP2-mediated DNA damage response and
desensitizing lung cancer cells to Top2 inhibitor-induced
growth inhibition. To our knowledge, this is the first
report regarding the post-translational regualtion of TDP2

activity and the role for ERK3 in inceasing DNA damage
response and drug resistance.

Results
ERK3 interacts with TDP2
We attempted to elucidate ERK3 signaling by
starting the identification of ERK3 interacting proteins. For
this purpose, endogenous ERK3 protein complex in H460
lung cancer cells was analyzed by immunoprecipitationmass spectrometry (IP-MS) following the procedures
described in our previous study [20]. Among protein
candidates identified (data not shown), TDP2, as a Tyrosyl
DNA phosphodiesterase, caught our attention in particular.

immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using a TDP2 Ab A., an ERK3 Ab B., or a corresponding control IgG (IgG Ctrl), followed by Western blotting.

respectively. Overlapping of immunofluorescent signals between ERK3 and TDP2 is reflected by the yellow immunofluorescence resulting

ERK3 and TDP2 protect cells against Top2
inhibitors-induced growth inhibition and
apoptosis

Interestingly, TDP2 was also identified as an interacting
partner of ERK3 by Yeast-two-hybrid screening in a
large-scale interactome analysis of cellular signalling
proteins [21]. The interaction between ERK3 and TDP2
was validated by co-immunoprecipitation using a TDP2
antibody (Figure 1A) or an ERK3 antibody (Figure 1B)
followed by Western blotting, and further verified by
immunofluorescent double staining of ERK3 and TDP2
(Figure 1C and Figure 1D). Of note, ERK3 and TDP2
primarily co-localize in the nucleus.

Cells would undergo growth inhibition and
apoptosis if DNA damage is not repaired upon the
treatment with Top2 inhibitors [22]. We thus determined
the effects of knocking down ERK3 and TDP2 on Top2
inhibitor-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.
As expected, in comparison with non-targeting shRNA/
siRNA control (shGIPZ + siCtrl), knockdown of TDP2
in both A549 (shGIPZ + siTDP2, Figure 3B) and H460
(shGIPZ + siTDP2, Figure 3D) sensitized cancer cells to
etoposide-induced cell growth inhibition. Knockdown of
ERK3 (shERK3 + siCtrl; Figure 3B and 3D) also greatly
enhanced etoposide-induced growth inhibition in both
cell lines. Simultaneous knockdown of ERK3 and TDP2
(shERK3+siTDP2), as compared to single knockdown, did
not significantly further enhance cancer cells’ sensitivity
to etoposide, suggesting ERK3 and TDP2 cooperatively
regulate the response of cancer cells to top2 inhibitorinduced DNA damage and growth inhibition.
We also examined the effects of ERK3 and TDP2
in etoposide-induced PARP-1 cleavage, a marker of
topoisomerase inhibitor-induced apoptosis [23]. As shown
in Figure 4, knockdown of either ERK3 (siCtrl/shERK3),
TDP2 (siTDP2/shGIPZ) or both (siTDP2/shERK3) greatly
increased the levels of cleaved PARP-1, suggesting
that ERK3 and TDP2 also protects cancer cells against
etoposide-induced apoptosis.

ERK3 and TDP2 cooperatively protects lung
cancer cells against Top2 inhibitors-induced DNA
damage
TDP2 regulates cancer cells’ response to DNA
damage and growth inhibition induced by Top2 inhibitors.
As TDP2 and ERK3 interact with each other and colocalize in the nucleus, we hypothesized that ERK3
regulates TDP2’s activity in DNA damage response. We
first tested whether ERK3 plays a similar role in protecting
cells against Top2-induced DNA damage. Indeed, similar
to knockdown of TDP2 (siTDP2), knockdown of ERK3
(siERK3) greatly increased H2AX phosphorylation
(γ-H2AX, a marker of DNA damage) induced by either
Etoposide (Figure 2A) or Teneposide (Figure 2B) in
H460 lung cancer cells. Interestingly, as compared to
single knockdown of either TDP2 or ERK3, simultaneous
knockdown of both ERK3 and TDP2 (siERK3 + siTDP2),
did not lead to further significant increase of γ-H2AX,
suggesting that TDP2 and ERK3 cooperatively regulate
Top2 inhibitors-induced DNA damage in a non-additive
manner. Similarly, knock down of ERK3 (shERK3/siCtrl,
Figure 3A), TDP2 (shGIPZ/siTDP2, Figure 3A) or both
(shERK3/siTDP2, Figure 3A) increased γ-H2AX in A549
lung cancer cells treated with etoposide. Of note, we found
that in line with previous findings, lung cancer cell lines
display highly differential response to Top2 inhibitor.
H157 lung cell line shows high basal level of γ-H2AX,
and etoposide treatment (even at the concentration of 20
µM) did not clearly alter γ-H2AX level (Figure S1A). In
H1395 cells, however, γ-H2AX was undetectable even
under the conditions with both TDP2 knockdown and
etoposide treatment (Figure S1B). Although etoposide
treatment did increase γ-H2AX level in H1437 lung cancer
cells, knockdown of TDP2 did not show obvious effect
(Figure S1C). As such, in our current study, we focused
on investigating the roles of TDP2 and ERK3 in DNA
damage response in H460 and A549 cell lines.

ERK3 phosphorylates TDP2 in vitro and promotes
TDP2’s phosphodiesterase activity
As ERK3 is a protein kinase and interacts with
TDP2, we hypothesised that ERK3 phosphorylates TDP2
and regulates TDP2 tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase
activity, thereby protecting cells against Top2-inhibitorinduced DNA damage and growth inhibition. To test
whether TDP2 is phosphorylated by ERK3, we performed
in vitro ERK3 kinase assay. As shown in Figure 5, ERK3
phosphorylates TDP2 in vitro. We then tested the effect
of ERK3 on TDP2 phosphodiesterase activity. Purified
TDP2 protein exhibited tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase
activity in vitro (indicated by the presence of cleaved
band) in a concentration dependent manner, whereas
EKR3 did not (Lane 5, Figure 6A). To determine the effect
of ERK3 on TDP2 enzymatic activity, we chose to add a
dose of 1.5 ng of TDP2, at which TDP2 elicits minimum
phosphodiesterase activity (Figure 6A). Importantly,
addition of ERK3 to the reaction greatly enhanced the
cleavage of the tyrosyl phosphorylated oligonucleotides
(Lane 3, Figure 6B), whereas ERK3 inactivated by boiling
did not show stimulating effect (Lane 4, Figure 6B). To
determine the regulation of TDP2 phosphodiesterase

ERK3 (Supplemental Table 1). To verify this, Serine 60
was mutated to alanine and in vitro ERK3 kinase assay
was performed using purified TDP2S60A as a substrate.
However, TDP2S60A was phosphorylated by ERK3 at
the equivalent level to that of wild type TDP2 (Figure
7A). This might be that there is ERK3 target site (s) other
than S60 in TDP2 and this site could not be detected in
the LC-MS analysis. Nevertheless, we tested the role of
S60 in TDP2’s tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase activity.
Interestingly, mutation of S60 to alanine (TDP2S60A)
almost abolished TDP2’s phosphodiesterase activity in
vitro (Lane 4, Figure 7B), whereas TDP2S60D (Lane 3,
Figure 7B) has slightly increased activity as compared
to wild type TDP2. We then examined the importance
of S60 in TDP2’s role in regulating DNA damage
response to etoposide treatment in cultured cells. As
compared to that of CDH vector control, exogenous
expression of TDP2 or TDP2S60D in A549 cells with
stable knockdown of endogenous TDP2 greatly decreased
etoposide-induced γ-H2AX level (Figure 7C) but
significantly increased cell survival (Figure 7D) in the
presence of etoposide treatment, whereas reintroduction
of TDP2S60A had little effect. Taken together, these
results demonstrate that ERK3 positively regulates
TDP2’s tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase activity, possibly
through phosphorylating S60 and thereby protecting cells
against Top2-inhibitor-induced DNA damage and growth
inhibition.

all of which are important for the recruitment of TDP1
to DNA damage site and its function in repairing DNA
damage [22]. The posttranslational regulation of TDP2’s
activity, however, is virtually unknown. Our current
study demonstrates that ERK3 phosphorylates TDP2 and
stimulates its tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase activity.
Structural analysis revealed that TDP2 contains an
N-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which
may regulates TDP2 enzymatic activity through the
intramolecular interaction with the c-terminal catalytic
domain [26]. Interestingly, S60 of TDP2, the ERK3
target site, is located in the UAB domain and mutation
of S60 to alanine abolished TDP2’s phosphodiesterase
activity (Figure 7B). Thus, it would be important to
determine whether phosphorylation of S60 mediates
this intermolecular interaction, thereby regulating TDP2
enzymatic activity. It is of note that S60A mutation did
not alter ERK3-mediated TDP2 phosphorylation in vitro.
We postulate that there is ERK3 target site (s) other than
S60 in TDP2, but the phosphorylation on this site was
not detected in the LC-MS analysis due to the limitation
of tryptic digestion. This putative phosphorylation site
may also play a role in regulating TDP2 activity, but S60
is critical so that mutation of this single residue almost
abolishes TDP2’s activity.
Although Top2 inhibitors, such as etoposide
and doxorubicin, have been used for treating cancer
patients, their clinic use is limited by drug resistance
and the adverse effects including toxicity and secondary
malignancy [27]. Much interest has been seen recently
on investigating TDP2 as it repairs Top2-mediated DNA
damage and confers cancer cells’ resistance to Top2
inhibitors [22]. Thus inhibiting TDP2 activity would
sensitize cancer cells’ to Top2 inhibitors-induced growth
inhibition and killing, thereby increasing the therapeutic
efficacy and decreasing the toxicity of Top2 inhibitors in
cancer treatment. On the basis of this therapeutic rationale,
a high-throughput screening (HTS) for TDP2 inhibitors
was recently carried out and toxoflavins and deazaflavins
were identified as selective inhibitors of this enzyme [28].
However, the further in vivo study of these two inhibitors
are challenged due to their redox activity and/or low cell
permeability. Our finding that TDP2 activity is regulated
by a phosphorylation site in the regulatory UBA domain
promises an alternative strategy for targeting TDP2. In
addition, ERK3, as a protein kinase, would be a potentially
attractive anti-cancer target as well.

Discussion
ERK3 (an atypical MAPK) differs from ERK1/2
(conventional MPAKs) in regard to the activation and
functions. ERK3 is constitutively phosphorylated at its
activation motif and is primarily localized in the nucleus
[24]. ERK3 has been shown to phosphorylate MK5 and
SRC-3 [16-18]. Phosphorylation of MK5 by ERK3 leads
to the translocation of MK5 from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm, while phosphorylation of SRC-3 by ERK3
stimulates the formation of a transcriptional complex
containing SRC-3, CBP and PEA-3 and the subsequent
expression of matrix metalloprotease genes. In this
study, we identified TDP2 as a new target of ERK3 and
they work together to protect cancer cells against Top2
inhibitors-induced DNA damage and growth inhibition.
Interestingly, although there is no previous report
specifically about the role of ERK3 in DNA damage repair
and drug resistance, ERK3 was shown to be upregulated in
MCF-7 cells with resistance to doxorubicin (another Top2
inhibitor) as compared to the parental MCF-7 cells that are
sensitive to this drug [25].
PTMs play essential roles in the process of DNA
damage repair by regulating the stability, the recruitment
to the DNA damage site and the activities of DNA damage
response proteins [8]. For example, TDP1 is modified by
phosphorylation (at S81), SUMOylation and PARylation,

(5′-CTAACTTGAGCGAAACGGT-3′) was added to
reduce nonspecific nucleolytic degradation of the duplex
substrate. To determine the effect of ERK3 on TDP2
activity, 20 ng of purified active or heat inactivated (at
90°C for 30min) ERK3 protein was incubated with TDP2
at 30°C for 30 min in the presence of 30μM ATP before
the oligonucleotide substrate was added. Reactions were
stopped by adding a four-fold excess of Novex TBE-Urea
loading buffer (Invitrogen). Reactions were resolved
on Novex 15% TBE-Urea PAGE gels (Invitrogen). The
FITC-labelled oligonucleotides were imaged by Fuji Gel
doc system.

Generation of lung cancer cell pools stably
expressing shRNAs by lentiviral transduction
Production of pseudolentiviral particles and
generation of stable cell pools by lentiviral transduction
were performed by following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Open Biosystems). Pseudolentiviruses
were produced in TLA-293T cells by co-transfecting
pGIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir expression construct and
Trans-Lentiviral packaging plasmid mix. Pseudoviral
particles were harvested 48 hrs post-transfection and
concentrated using PEG-it virus precipitation solution
(System Biosciences) by following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were transduced with prepared virus
with the addition of polybrene (5μg/ml). Two days posttransduction, cells were split and selected by puromycin
(1 μg/ml) for 10 days. Knockdown of the targeted genes’
expression was verified by Western blotting analysis.

Statistical analysis

Generation of lentiviruses expressing TDP2
cDNAs

Results are expressed as mean ± s.e. Statistical
significance was determined by a two-sided Student’s t
test. A P-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically
significant.

Pseudotype lentiviruses were produced in 293T
cells by cotransfecting lentiviral pCDH-TDP2 expressing
construct and pPACK Packaging Plasmid Mix (System
Biosciences), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Pseudoviral particles were harvested 48 hours after
transfection and concentrated using PEG-it Virus
Precipitation Solution.

Cell growth-drug sensitivity assay
Lung cancer cell pools stably expressing shGIPZ
or shERK3 were seeded in 96 well plate. Twenty-four
hour post seeding, cells were transfected either with nontargeting siRNA (siCtrl) or siRNA specifically targeting
TDP2 (siTDP2). Two days post-transfection, cells were
treated with etoposide at different concentrations (0.5 μM
to 25 μM) for two days. Cell proliferation was determined
using the CellTiter 96 AQueous MTS One Solution
Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega), following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
