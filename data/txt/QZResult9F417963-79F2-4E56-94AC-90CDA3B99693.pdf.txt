Cetuximab Attenuates Its Cytotoxic and Radiosensitizing
Potential by Inducing Fibronectin Biosynthesis

Abstract
Inherent and acquired resistance to targeted therapeutics continues to emerge as a major clinical obstacle. For
example, resistance to EGF receptor targeting occurs commonly, more so than was expected, on the basis of
preclinical work. Given emerging evidence that cancer cell–substrate interactions are important determinants of
therapeutic sensitivity, we examined the impact of cell–ﬁbronectin interactions on the efﬁcacy of the EGF
receptor antibody cetuximab, which is used widely for lung cancer treatment. Our results revealed the potential
for cell–ﬁbronectin interactions to induce radioresistance of human non–small cell lung cancer cells. Cell
adhesion to ﬁbronectin enhanced tumor cell radioresistance and attenuated the cytotoxic and radiosensitizing
effects of cetuximab. Both in vitro and in vivo, we found that cetuximab treatment led to a remarkable induction of
ﬁbronectin biosynthesis. Mechanistic analyses revealed the induction was mediated by a p38–MAPK–ATF2
signaling pathway and that RNAi-mediated inhibition of ﬁbronectin could elevate the cytotoxic and radiosensitizing potential of cetuximab. Taken together, our ﬁndings show how cell adhesion blunts cetuximab,
which, by inducing ﬁbronectin, generates a self-attenuating mechanism of drug resistance. Cancer Res; 73(19);

Introduction
Molecular therapies have opened a promising novel
approach to overcome tumor–type-dependent cancer cell
resistance to radio- and chemotherapy (1, 2). Overexpressed
in lung, head and neck, colorectal, and breast carcinomas as
well as glioblastomas and other tumors, the EGF receptor
(EGFR) serves as targetable key promoter of tumor growth and
progression (3). Inhibitory components block either the cytoplasmic EGFR tyrosine kinase or the extracellular ligandbinding domain to suppress prosurvival and mitogenic downstream signaling (4). However, clinical evaluations of these
targeting strategies showed differential efﬁcacy mostly falling
below expectations from preclinical analysis (5, 6).
In a phase III clinical trial on head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC), cetuximab signiﬁcantly increased locoregional tumor control and overall patient survival in combination with radiotherapy as compared with radiotherapy alone

(7, 8) whereas studies in colorectal cancers using cetuximab
monotherapy indicated a small beneﬁt in the time to disease
progression (9). Only recently, in phase II and III clinical trials,
was the feasibility of combined cetuximab administration
given simultaneously to standard platinum-based chemotherapeutics or radiochemotherapy shown, resulting in improved
survival of patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC;
ref. 10). For individualized patient identiﬁcation and triage for
cetuximab therapy, an intensive search for resistance factors is
ongoing as three potential indicators, that is, EGFR copy
number (11), nuclear EGFR localization, and KRAS mutational
status (12–14), have failed to predict cetuximab efﬁcacy in
NSCLC. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms attenuating
cetuximab's efﬁcacy remain to be determined.
Integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM)
might play an essential role in reducing cetuximab activity as a
result of cooperative reciprocal actions and transactivation
between EGFR and integrin cell adhesion receptors. This could
occur through Src-dependent p130Cas phosphorylation (15),
phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt (16), and JNK-interacting protein-4/JNK2 signaling (17); integrin-mediated adhesion to ECM might play an essential role in reducing cetuximab
activity. Previous work showed attenuated cytotoxicity and
radiosensitization of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors like
BIBX1382BS or Iressa by cell adhesion to ECM (18–20). Taking
the role of ECM in determining EGFR transcriptional
responses, EGFR–integrin transactivation and integrin-mediated ECM protein synthesis into consideration (21, 22), we
hypothesize that EGFR signaling critically contributes to
the regulation of ECM protein synthesis and secretion, which,
in turn, could modulate radio-, chemo-, and cetuximab
resistance.

Fibronectin is abundantly expressed in various human
tumors (23), and it has been postulated to aid in the promotion
of tumor growth and progression as a result of participating in
the development of an ideal microenvironment through extensive ECM remodeling (24–27). Transcription of the FN gene is
accomplished by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) activation and cyclic AMP response element (CRE)/
CCAAT site-dependent phosphorylation of the activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2; refs. 28, 29). Additional transcription
factors involved in FN gene transcription are CRE-binding
protein (CREB) and early growth response-1 (EGR-1; refs. 30,
31). Participation of the EGFR in ECM protein biosynthesis has
not been documented to date. Therefore, we investigated the
possibility that reduction or loss of cetuximab-mediated cytotoxicity and radiosensitization of NSCLC cells arises from cell
adhesion to ﬁbronectin as well as from and effect of cetuximab
itself on extensive stimulation of ﬁbronectin biosynthesis and
secretion. We show that cetuximab-induced cytotoxicity and
radiosensitization is reduced when cells are adherent to ﬁbronectin. Mechanistically, application of cetuximab promotes
ﬁbronectin biosynthesis and secretion via p38 MAPK/ATF2
signaling. This study indicates a critical role for ECM proteins
in cetuximab resistance in human NSCLC.

and Alexa488 anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) were purchased as indicated. Enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (ECL) was from
Amersham, Oligofectamine and Lipofectamine 2000 from Invitrogen, BrdU and BSA from Serva, RNase A type III-A from
Sigma, and pepsin 0.7 FIP-U from Merck. Vectashield/40 , 6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) mounting medium was from
Alexis, and Alexa Flour 594 Phalloidin from Molecular Probes.
Cell culture and radiation exposure
A549 and H1299 cells were purchased from the American
Tissue Culture Collection in 2006. Since then, cells were
passaged less than 30 times before experiments were conducted. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium (DMEM) containing GlutaMax-I supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (FCS; PAA) and 1% non-essential amino
acids (PAA) at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing
10% CO2 (pH 7.4). Where indicated, cells were grown on
ﬁbronectin (1 mg/cm2; BD) precoated plates as previously
published (18). In all experiments, asynchronously growing
cells were used. Irradiation was delivered at room temperature
using single doses of 200 kV X-rays (1.3 Gy/min, 20 mA; Yxlon
Y.TU 320; Yxlon) ﬁltered with 0.5 mm Cu. In fractionation

experiments, single doses of 2 Gy/d were delivered on three
consecutive days. The absorbed dose was measured using a
Duplex dosimeter (PTW).
Colony formation assay
The colony formation assay was applied for measurement of
clonogenic cell survival as previously described (32). In brief,
cells were grown on ﬁbronectin or without substrate (poly-S)
for 24 hours. Before irradiation, cells were incubated with
cetuximab (0–20 mg/mL; Merck). After 8 days, cells were
stained with Coomassie blue and cell colonies (>50 cells) were
counted. Plating efﬁciencies were calculated as follows: numbers of colonies formed/numbers of cells plated. Surviving
fractions were calculated as follows: numbers of colonies
formed/(numbers of cells plated (irradiated)  plating efﬁciency (unirradiated)). Each point on survival curves represents the mean surviving fraction from at least three independent experiments.
Real-time PCR
Cells were plated on poly-S  FCS and treated with cetuximab (5 mg/mL). After 24 and 48 hours, cells were isolated and
total RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit
(Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, RNA was transcribed into cDNA (Superscript III
Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen). Reactions were conducted
using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master PLUS HybProbe
kit (Roche) and speciﬁc primers and probes (TIB MOLBIOL;
Supplementary Table S2). The expression level of ﬁbronectin
was normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene
TATA-box binding protein.
Total protein extracts and Western blot
Cells grown either on poly-S or ﬁbronectin  FCS were treated
with cetuximab (5 mg/mL). Where indicated, cells were incubated with EGF (20 ng/mL; Calbiochem) for 15 minutes. For lysis,
cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS before adding modiﬁed
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mmol/L
Tris–HCl; pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet-P40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, Complete protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche), 1 mmol/L NaVO4, 2 mmol/L NaF), scraping and
measuring total protein amounts with the BCA assay (Pierce).
After SDS–PAGE and transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), probing and detection of
speciﬁc proteins was accomplished with indicated antibodies
and ECL as described previously (18). Dot blotting was employed
for determining secreted matrix proteins upon C225 (5 mg/mL)
exposure. The medium was dropped onto nitrocellulose membranes and matrix proteins were detected with indicated antibodies and ECL.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining
Localization of ATF2 and CREB was analyzed in cells grown
on poly-S with or without 48-hour cetuximab treatment (5
mg/mL). Staining of proteins was accomplished with speciﬁc
antibodies, Alexa Fluor 594 Phalloidin, and Vectashield/DAPI
mounting medium. Alexa Fluor 568-labeling of cetuximab by
Protein Labeling Kit (Invitrogen) was employed for EGFR

localization studies of 1% formaldehyde/PBS ﬁxed and 0.25%
Triton X-100/PBS permeabilized cells.
Tumor xenograft models and combined treatment with
cetuximab plus fractionated irradiation
To assess the effects of cetuximab in vivo, A549 tumor
xenografts were investigated. Animal facilities and experiments
were approved by the Landesdirektion Dresden (Dresden,
Germany), according to the German animal welfare regulations. Immunocompromised 7- to 14-week-old male and
female NMRI (nu/nu) mice (Experimental Centre of the Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus; Technische Universit€at Dresden) were further immunosuppressed by whole-body irradiation. Tumor pieces were transplanted on the hindleg of anesthetized nude mice as described previously (32, 33). At a
diameter of approximately 7 mm, animals were treated with
two injections of cetuximab (1 mg/injection per mouse) intraperitoneally at day 0 and 7. Six hours after the second injection,
cetuximab-treated and control tumors were excised, cut into
halves, and either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or ﬁxed in
formalin and embedded in parafﬁn as described previously (32,
33). Then, immunohistochemistry was conducted on parafﬁnembedded tumors using the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector
Laboratories) and anti-Fibronectin antibody (BD). For tumor
growth-delay experiments, A549 tumor pieces were taken from
a cryoconserved source and transplanted subcutaneously into
the hind leg of anesthetized and whole–body-irradiated nude
mice. After reaching a tumor diameter of 6 mm (100 mm3),
treatment schedules were started. The animals received either
cetuximab alone (1 injection day 0; 1 mg cetuximab per animal
per injection) plus 30 irradiation fractions in six weeks to
graded total doses. Tumor growth time (time to reach 5-fold
the starting volume) was evaluated as described previously (34).
siRNA-mediated knockdown of EGFR, ITGB1, ITGA5,
ﬁbronectin, p38 MAPK, and ATF2
Fibronectin siRNA (sense: 50 -GGACAUCCUAUAGAAUUGGtt-30 ), EGFR siRNA (sense: 50 -GGCACGAGUAACAAGCUCAtt-30 ), ITGB1 siRNA (sense: 50 -GGAACCCUUGCACAAGUGAtt-30 ), ITGA5 siRNA (sense: 50 -GGGAACCUCACUUACGGCUtt-30 ), MEK1 siRNA (sense: 50 -GGAGCUAGAGCUUGAUGAGtt-30 ), p38 MAPK siRNA (sense: 50 -GGAAUUCAAUGAUGUGUAUtt-30 ) and ATF2 siRNA (sense: 50 -CCAGGAUAGUCCUUUACCUtt-30 ), were obtained from Applied Biosystems. A nonspeciﬁc siRNA (sense: 50 -GCAGCUAUAUGAAUGUUGUtt-30 ; MWG) was used as control. Cells were prepared
for siRNA transfection (20 nmol/L) with oligofectamine under
serum-free conditions as previously described (35). Twentyfour hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and subjected to colony formation, real-time PCR, or Western blot.
Kinase assays
Cells were incubated with cetuximab (5 mg/mL) for one hour
or Ly294002 (20 mmol/L), PD98059 (25 mmol/L), SP600125 (10
mmol/L), or SB203680 (20 mmol/L) for 30 minutes. Kinase
activity of Akt, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK was measured
according to the manufacturer's protocol and as recently
published (33).

Cell-cycle analysis
Cell-cycle measurements have been conducted as described
previously (19) and as described in Supplementary Materials.
Promotor assay
Deletion mutants of the human FN1 promoter were ampliﬁed from DNA isolated from human blood with the QIAamp
Blood Kit (Qiagen) with speciﬁc primers according to FN1 50 untranslated region and 50 ﬂanking genomic sequences (NCBI
Reference Sequence No. NT_005403.17). Sequences ampliﬁed
encompassed nucleotides 530/þ266 and 171/þ266 of the
human FN1 promoter with ﬂanking Kpn I/Xho I restriction
sites (speciﬁc primers -530fw: 50 -gg-ggtacc-GGATTCTTAACAGCTGCAAGG-30 ; -171fw: 50 -gg-ggtacc-GAGCCCGGGCCAATCGGCG-30 ; þ266rev: 50 -ccg-ctcgag-GTTGAGACGGTGGGGGAGAG-30 ). PCR products were inserted into Kpn I/Xho
I sites of pGL3 Basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). For
luciferase reporter gene expression under the control of the
different promoter constructs, cells were transiently transfected with pGL3 constructs and pRL-TK Renilla luciferase
expression vector (Promega) as internal control of transfection
efﬁciency. Cells were examined after EGFR knockdown (nonspeciﬁc siRNA was used as control). pCMV control vector was
used as positive control, whereas the pGL3 Basic vector
without promoter was transfected as negative control. Measurement of luciferase expression was done with the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Promotor activity was calculated as
follows: (luciferase activity FN1 promotor/Renilla)  (luciferase activity pGL3 Basic/Renilla). Results were normalized to
530/þ266 FN1 promotor activity in control siRNA cells.
Microarray datasets
For analysis of FN1 (Fibronectin) mRNA expression, Oncomine transcriptom datasets were searched for studies comparing patients with NSCLC at different tumor stages (I–IV) or
different overall survival time (alive after three years vs. dead
after three years; Supplementary Table S1). The normalized
values of the individual datasets were combined and further
analyzed with regard to differential gene expression using the
2-sided Student t test.
Data analysis
Means  SD of at least three independent experiments were
calculated with reference to untreated controls deﬁned in a 1.0
scale. To test statistical signiﬁcance, Student t test was conducted using Microsoft Excel 2003. Results were considered
statistically signiﬁcant if a P value of less than 0.05 was reached.

Results
Fibronectin expression is increased in advanced NSCLC
and adhesion to ECM potently attenuates cetuximabmediated cytotoxicity and radiosensitization
According to a DNA microarray database search (www.
oncomine.org), ﬁbronectin expression in NSCLC signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.01) increases with higher Union Internationale Contre le
Cancer (UICC) stage as compared with limited disease NSCLC
(stage I; Fig. 1A; n ¼ 421). In addition, the tumor ﬁbronectin

expression in patients who died within 3 years after biopsy, was
also signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) higher than in patients who were
still alive after 3 years (Fig. 1A; n ¼ 266). Based on the ability of
cetuximab to efﬁciently inhibit EGFR in a substratum-independent manner (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1A and 1B),
we treated A549 and H1299 cells with cetuximab alone or in
combination with single or fractionated doses of X-rays.
Intriguingly, the cetuximab-dependent cytotoxicity and
radiosensitization observed on polystyrene (poly-S) was
strongly diminished when cells grew on ﬁbronectin (Fig.
1C and Supplementary Fig. S1C). These effects were detectable both after single and fractionated irradiation (Fig. 1C
and Supplementary Fig. S1C). Proliferation kinetics and cellcycling data generated under similar experimental conditions showed that these ﬁndings were not due to cell-cycle
effects of cetuximab or ﬁbronectin (Supplementary Fig. S1D

5872

and S1E). Notably, H1299 cells were resistant to cetuximab
monotherapy but showed radiosensitization when grown on
poly-S (Fig. 1C). Moreover, radiation survival was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) higher in ECM-grown cultures than in polyS cultures, which illustrates the prosurvival effects of ECM
adhesion (Fig. 1C). To test for the efﬁcacy of cetuximab in
vivo, A549 xenografts tumors were treated with varying
single doses of X-rays without and in combination with
cetuximab for tumor volume and control probability (Fig.
1D). Despite a slight and nonsigniﬁcant delay in tumor
growth by cetuximab alone, cetuximab did not signiﬁcantly
affect growth of irradiated A549 tumors as shown for the
time to reach the 5-fold tumor volume (Fig. 1D). Thus, cell
adhesion to ﬁbronectin and in vivo growth conditions effectively attenuate cetuximab antisurvival effects in NSCLC
cells and tumors in nude mice.

suggest that the a5b1 integrins are critical in the process of
cetuximab attenuation observed in ﬁbronectin-adherent
NSCLC cells.

Integrins mediate the effect of ﬁbronectin on cetuximab
efﬁcacy
On the basis of these observations, we next assessed how
extracellular ﬁbronectin impacts on survival and radiosensitization upon EGFR inhibition. As the heterodimeric a5b1
integrin receptor is the main mediator for binding of cells to
ﬁbronectin, we carried out a combined knockdown of these
two integrin subunits and monitored changes in basal and
radiation survival of cetuximab-treated ﬁbronectin cell
cultures. Efﬁcient a5b1 integrin depletion (Fig. 2A) resulted
in unmodiﬁed basal cell survival (Fig. 2A). Interestingly,
a5b1 integrin-depleted ﬁbronectin cell cultures were sensitized to cetuximab monotherapy (Fig. 2A) as compared to
controls (Fig. 1C). Based on radiosensitization mediated
by downregulation of a5b1 integrin (Fig. 2A), these data

Cetuximab enhances ﬁbronectin biosynthesis
Subsequently, we analyzed whether EGFR and cetuximab
are involved in ﬁbronectin biosynthesis. Twenty-four and 48hour serum-starvation-control experiments (to evaluate the
effects of growth factor withdrawal) revealed a signiﬁcant
elevation in FN mRNA and protein synthesis (Supplementary
Fig. S2A–E). Cetuximab induced FN mRNA in A549 cells and
protein expression in A549 and H1299 cells in vitro (Fig. 2B and
C) and in vivo in A549 tumor xenografts (Fig. 2E). To prove
EGFR dependence of these results, we depleted EGFR expression by siRNA and found a signiﬁcant (P < 0.01) increase of

selective phosphoprotein array (Fig. 4B–D). Intriguingly, JNK1T183/Y185 and p38 MAPK-T180/Y182, which were not represented in the array, exhibited a hyperphosphorylation upon
cetuximab exposure (Fig. 4C and D).

Fibronectin depletion promotes the cytotoxic and
radiosensitizing potential of cetuximab
To provide evidence that ﬁbronectin is a key antagonist of
cetuximab efﬁcacy, ﬁbronectin secretion by NSCLC cells was
impaired by siRNA-mediated silencing of ﬁbronectin expression, and these cells were treated with cetuximab (Fig. 3A). The
data revealed an increase in cetuximab cytotoxicity under
absent or very low ﬁbronectin levels (Fig. 3B and C). Similarly,
ﬁbronectin depletion rendered A549 and H1299 cells signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) more radiosensitive relative to controls
(Fig. 3D).

p38 MAPK plays an essential role in cetuximabdependent ﬁbronectin production
Next, we sought to analyze the activities of EGFR-associated
protein kinases potentially inducing ﬁbronectin expression via
cetuximab. In line with protein phosphorylations shown in Fig.
4, cetuximab resulted in unaltered Akt, reduced ERK1/2, and
increased JNK and p38 MAPK kinase activities (Fig. 5A and B).
Inhibitors for PI3K (Ly294002), MAPK (PD59009), MEK1
(U0126), and the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203680) potently
attenuated or reduced the corresponding protein kinase activity (Fig 5A) or phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). However, cetuximabinduced ﬁbronectin expression was exceptionally diminished
by p38 MAPK inhibition using SB203680 (Fig. 5B) – a ﬁnding
conﬁrmed by p38 MAPK siRNA knockdown (Fig. 5C). These
data also strongly suggest a particular involvement of EGFRMEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling in ﬁbronectin biosynthesis, as inhibition of MEK1/2 showed similar ﬁbronectin induction (Fig. 5B
and Supplementary Fig. S4) as observed with EGFR inhibition
(see Fig. 2).

EGFR remains localized to the cell membrane and p38
MAPK, and JNK1 phosphorylation is induced on
cetuximab treatment
The subcellular cetuximab–EGFR interaction and the responsible signaling molecules involved in cetuximab-mediated ﬁbronectin induction were evaluated next. Immunoﬂuorescence
EGFR staining in combination with Alexa Fluor 568-labeled
cetuximab of A549 and H1299 cells and cetuximab-treated
EGFR-CFP A549 transfectants revealed stable membranous
EGFR localization throughout the examined 48-hour time period (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S3). Concomitantly, EGFRY1173 and Akt-S473 phosphorylation remained unchanged
whereas EGFR-Y1068 showed a transient, monophasic dephosphorylation, in contrast to stable hypophosphorylation of ERK1/
2-T202/Y204 representing the only protein kinase altered in a

exhibited T69/71 hyperphosphorylation on cetuximab treatment or EGFR depletion in A549 and H1299 cells whereas other
putative transcription factors for the FN1 gene promoter, that
is, CREB and EGR1, remained unaltered (Fig. 6A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S5). This ATF2 hyperphosphorylation
mainly occurred in the cell nucleus after cetuximab treatment
visualized by immunoﬂuorescence staining (Fig. 6C). Using
ATF2 knockdown, ﬁbronectin biosynthesis by cetuximab was
maintained at basal levels, indicating a critical function of
ATF2 in this context (Fig. 6D). We further provide evidence for
p38 MAPK signaling to ATF2 for ﬁbronectin biosynthesis
regulation indicated by absent ATF2 hyperphosphorylation
on cetuximab treatment under siRNA-mediated knockdown or
pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK (Fig. 6E and F). Finally,
it is shown that deletion of the 530 to 171 bp sequence of
FN1 gene promoter region, which include the ATF2 binding
sites, prevented the induction of FN1 promoter activity after
EGFR inhibition (Fig. 6G and Supplementary Fig. S6). Based on

unchanged CREB phosphorylation and subcellular localization
on cetuximab treatment, we exclude an essential role of this
transcription factor in the investigated context. From these
observations, we hypothesize a direct function of ATF2 in FN1
gene transcription and ﬁbronectin protein synthesis on cetuximab-mediated EGFR inhibition (Fig. 6H).

Discussion
Resistance mechanisms against modern molecular drugs are,
with speciﬁc exceptions, not well understood. Due to its prominent role in cancer cell proliferation, EGFR has been targeted
with antibodies or pharmacologic inhibitors with the intention
to reduce tumor growth and enhance sensitization to conventional radio(chemo)therapy. Regarding these goals, the additional administration of anti-EGFR compounds to radio(chemo)
therapeutic regimes has resulted in a range of responses in
different EGFR-overexpressing tumor types. In general, antiEGFR therapies have failed to meet the outcome predicted by

preclinical investigations. Deﬁnite criteria for patient selection
are missing. In addition, intra- and/or extracellular resistance
mechanisms can be induced by drugs such as cetuximab raising
questions as to the rationale and beneﬁts for their clinical use in
unselected patients. Here, we identiﬁed a novel resistance
mechanism by showing that ﬁbronectin biosynthesis is pronouncedly stimulated by cetuximab-mediated EGFR inhibition
in human NSCLC cells and NSCLC tumor xenografts. Although
adhesion to ﬁbronectin attenuated cetuximab's cytotoxic and
radiosensitizing efﬁcacy, depletion of ﬁbronectin sensitized
NSCLC cells to cetuximab through a mechanism speciﬁcally
involving p38 MAPK-ATF2 signaling.

sive ECM remodeling by destructively and invasively growing
cancer cells (36). Analysis of DNA microarray databases (www.
oncomine.org) revealed a signiﬁcant, tumor grade-dependent
increase in ﬁbronectin expression in NSCLC. Furthermore,
patients dying within three years showed signiﬁcantly higher
ﬁbronectin expression than patients still alive after three years,
indicating that ﬁbronectin expression may serve as a potential
prognostic marker. Similar observations have been made in
laryngeal, breast, and urothelial cancers (37–39). There is
abundant, heterogenous ECM protein expression in tumors
and their activated stroma. Radiotherapy (40) and, as shown
here, molecular drugs like cetuximab induce ECM protein
biosynthesis and remodeling – an event mostly neglected as
a potential process of acquired resistance to therapy.

Figure 6. ATF2 mediates upregulation of ﬁbronectin after EGFR inhibition. Western blot (A) of NSCLC cells treated with cetuximab (5 mg/mL) for 24 or 48 hours or
after knockdown of EGFR (B). C, immunoﬂuorescence staining of ATF2 and phosphorylated ATF2 in A549 cells 48 hours after treatment with cetuximab
(5 mg/mL). D, after ATF2 siRNA transfection (nonspeciﬁc siRNA as control, Co), cells were treated with cetuximab for 24 or 48 hours and lysed for
Western blot. Analysis of ATF2 expression and phosphorylation after p38 MAPK knockdown (nonspeciﬁc siRNA as control, Co; E) or exposure with p38 MAPK
inhibitor (p38i; SB203680, 20 mmol/L; dimethyl sulfoxide as control; F). G, promoter activity of FN promoter constructs was measured by analyzing luciferase
activity. A549 cells were transfected with EGFR siRNA or nonspeciﬁc siRNA (Co) for 48 hours. H, proposed mechanisms of how cetuximab inhibits the MEK/
ERK pathway and, on the other side, activates p38 MAPK and ATF2, which results in increased ﬁbronectin synthesis.

This strongly suggests that interactions of tumor cells with
ECM proteins as well as therapy-induced ECM biosynthesis
counteract modern multimodal cancer therapies. Conﬁrmatory data for both issues are shown here as the tested A549 and
H1299 human NSCLC cells show higher radioresistance as well
as a diminished cytotoxic and radiosensitizing potential of
cetuximab on adhesion to ﬁbronectin. These ﬁndings corroborate published data in cells from other malignancies and on
other drugs (41–43).
Intriguingly, ﬁbronectin is apparently involved in how effectively EGFR inhibition mediates antisurvival biochemical cues.
In normal cells, blocking EGFR signals leads to ECM production, cell differentiation, and anoikis in parallel to prevention of
mitogenesis and migration (44, 45). It seems that these effects
differentially occur in tumor cells dependent on EGFR mutations, tissue origin, and type of inhibitor (46), which challenges
the rationale for patient selection for anti-EGFR agents. Moreover, these observations clearly reveal a tight spatiotemporal

www.aacrjournals.org

interaction between EGFR and cell-adhesion molecules like
integrins. One might take advantage of adhesion-blocking
compounds such as inhibitory anti-integrin antibodies to
overcome resistance to anti-EGFR agents. Indeed, the effectiveness of anti-integrin compounds to reduced radio- and
chemoresistance has been shown preclinically in head and
neck and breast carcinoma models in combination with radioor chemotherapy (32, 47).
Alternative approaches for preventing cetuximab autoinhibitory processes might target the signaling molecules involved
in ﬁbronectin biosynthesis and secretion. As cetuximab-inhibited EGFR stably remained in the cell membrane, p38 MAPK is
a putative candidate differentially expressed in tumor versus
normal tissues. Intriguingly, inhibition of protein kinases
downstream of EGFR such as MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and PI3K led
to increased ﬁbronectin biosynthesis similar to that observed
after EGFR blocking or downregulation. Targeting ATF2,
whose contribution to the regulation of FN1 gene expression

has been previously described (28), might cause severe side
effects due its function as a transcription factor for a variety of
other genes such as cyclin A and IFN-b (48). Mechanistically,
ATF2, but not CREB or EGR1, is essential for ﬁbronectin
biosynthesis after EGFR blocking or knockdown in human
NSCLC cells. Depletion of the 530 to 171 bp sequence of FN1
gene promoter region, including the ATF2 binding site,
completely abrogated the upregulation of FN1 gene expression
induced by depletion of EGFR.
In summary, antisurvival effects of the inhibitory anti-EGFR
antibody cetuximab are counteracted by an autostimulation of
speciﬁc resistance bypass signal transduction pathways. Evidently, extreme stimulation of ECM biosynthesis by cetuximab
and adhesion to ECM proteins potently attenuate the cytotoxic
and radiosensitizing potential of cetuximab. Deciphering in
more detail the complex pathology of how EGFR mediates
biochemical cues in cancer cells might be of particular importance for the optimization of individual patient selection
for anti-EGFR strategies and the identiﬁcation of novel
approaches to prevent resistance mechanisms induced by
anti-EGFR compounds themselves.
