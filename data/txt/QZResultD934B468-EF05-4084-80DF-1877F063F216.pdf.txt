Damage–Induced Apoptosis by Downregulating the
Antiapoptotic Short Isoform of Caspase-2

Abstract
XPC protein is a critical DNA damage recognition factor in nucleotide excision repair for which genetic
deﬁciency confers a predisposition to cancer. In this study, we show that XPC has a function that is independent of
its canonical function in DNA repair, potentially altering the interpretation of how XPC deﬁciency leads to
heightened cancer susceptibility. XPC enhances apoptosis induced by DNA damage in a p53 nullizygous
background, acting downstream of mitochondrial permeabilization and upstream of caspase-9 activation in
the DNA damage–induced apoptosis cascade. We found that deﬁciency in XPC upregulated production of the
short isoform of caspase-2 (casp-2S). This upregulation occurred at both protein and mRNA levels through
repression of the caspase-2 promoter by XPC protein. Targeted RNAi-mediated downregulation of casp-2S–
enhanced UV-induced apoptosis as well as activation of caspase-9 and caspase-6 in XPC-deﬁcient cells, but not in
XPC-proﬁcient cells. In addition, XPC overexpression in various p53-deﬁcient cancer cells resistant to cisplatin
improved their sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Given that casp-2S functions as an antiapoptotic
protein, our ﬁndings suggest that XPC enhances DNA damage–induced apoptosis through inhibition of casp-2S
transcription. Together, these ﬁndings offer a mechanistic foundation to overcome the resistance of highly
prevalent p53-deﬁcient tumors to cell death induced by DNA-damaging therapeutic agents, by targeting
strategies that inhibit the expression or function of casp-2S. Cancer Res; 72(3); 666–75. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
DNA lesions induced by UV light and the chemotherapeutic
agent cisplatin are mainly removed by the nucleotide excision
repair (NER) consisting of 2 subpathways termed transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and global genomic repair (GGR;
ref. 1). TCR is required for the preferential removal of lesions
from the transcribed strand of active genes, whereas GGR is
responsible for the removal of DNA lesions from the bulk of the
genome (1). Cell lines derived from individuals suffering from
the disorders like xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne
syndrome (CS) have defects in one or both of these NER

subpathways. Speciﬁcally, XP-C cells have a defect in GGR but
not TCR. In contrast, CS-A and CS-B cells are defective in TCR
but not GGR (2), whereas XP-A cells have defects in both TCR
and GGR (1).
TCR-deﬁcient ﬁbroblasts (e.g., CS-A and XP-A) are extremely
sensitive to UV- and cisplatin-induced apoptosis (3–5), whereas XP-C cells with selective defect in GGR but with proﬁcient
TCR have normal resistance to cisplatin (6, 7). In addition,
murine Xpc/ keratinocytes are characterized by a complete
absence of apoptosis after UV exposure, in contrast to Xpa/
and Csb/ cells (8). These reports suggest that unrepaired
DNA damage in the transcribed strand is an indispensable
trigger for UV/cisplatin-induced apoptosis. However, increasing evidence has suggested that unrepaired DNA lesions in the
nontranscribed strands or transcriptionally inactive genes can
cause replication blockage, which also acts as an apoptosisinducing signal (9). It has been reported that Xpa/ keratinocytes (TCR and GGR deﬁciency) showed greater apoptosis
than Csb/ cells (TCR only deﬁciency) following UV irradiation (8). Given that both cells have deﬁcient TCR, the additional GGR deﬁciency in Xpa/ cells must be a contributing
factor in UV-induced apoptosis. Although transcription blockage is absent in XP-C cells due to proﬁcient TCR, the replication
blockage induced by deﬁcient GGR is sufﬁcient to trigger
apoptosis in these cells. Therefore, the resistance of XP-C cells
to UV/cisplatin-induced apoptosis could not be simply attributed to the proﬁcient TCR. This prompts us to hypothesize that
an important apoptosis element must be lost in XP-C cells.

XPC Enhances Apoptosis through Reducing Caspase-2S

XPC is a 940-amino acid protein and harbors domains that
can bind to damaged DNA and repair factors (10–12). The
major function of XPC is to recognize helix-distorting lesions
located in a transcriptionally inactive genome or a nontranscribed strand of actively transcribed genes (13). Recent studies have suggested that beyond its role in DNA repair, the XPC
protein is also involved in transcriptional process including
both transcription activation and repression (14, 15). However,
the relationship between XPC- and apoptosis-related gene
transcription is yet to be established.
Caspases are a family of cysteine aspartate–speciﬁc proteases involved in the initiation or execution of apoptosis.
Caspase-2 (casp-2) is the most conserved caspase across
species and is one of the initiator caspases activated by various
stimuli (reviewed in ref. 16). The casp-2 gene produces several
alternative splicing isoforms. The inclusion of exon 9 leads to
the inclusion of an in-frame stop codon in casp-2 short isoform
(casp-2S) mRNA, thus producing a truncated protein that
inhibits cell death, whereas the exclusion of exon 9 results in
casp-2 long isoform (casp-2L) mRNA, whose protein product
induces cell death (17, 18).
In this study, we have uncovered a novel function of XPC as a
potent enhancer of apoptosis in the absence of any inﬂuence by
p53. From a mechanistic standpoint, XPC protein downregulates antiapoptotic casp-2S through inhibition of its promoter
activity and thus promotes DNA damage–induced activation
of casp-9 and casp-6, which ultimately enhances cellular death.

State University). Except for the regular testing for mycoplasma contamination using a PCR-based assay, the cell lines were
not speciﬁcally authenticated. The cultures were maintained
as described in Supplementary Data, and the cells were treated
with cisplatin or UV as described before (19).
Plasmids and transfection
pXPC3 plasmid containing XPC cDNA and its corresponding
empty vector pEBS7 were kindly provided by Dr. R. Legerski

XPC shRNA (short hairpin RNA)-containing plasmids (pLKO.1puro) were purchased from Sigma. p3XFLAG-CMV-14-casp-2S
construct was generated in our laboratory (Supplementary
Data). Casp-2S promoter-luciferase construct Del4 has been
described (21, 22). The plasmids were transfected into cells by
either FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine

www.aacrjournals.org

LTX reagents (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's
instructions.
Western blot analysis
Whole-cell lysates were prepared by boiling cell pellets for
10 minutes in lysis buffer [2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 62 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, at pH 6.8, and a complete mini-protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Applied Science)]. For the detection of
cytochrome c (cyto c) release, cells were harvested by trypsinization, and the cytosol was separated as described (23).
Equal amounts of proteins were loaded, separated on a
polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Protein bands were immunodetected with appropriate
antibodies (Supplementary Data).
Apoptosis analysis by Annexin V staining
Phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaﬂet of the
plasma membrane was detected by the Annexin V–GFP apoptosis detection Kit II (BD Pharmingen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, 1  106 cells were pelleted
following treatment and washed in PBS. Cells were then
resuspended in 500 mL of binding buffer, mixed with Annexin
V–GFP and propidium iodide and incubated at room temperature (22 C) for 5 to 10 minutes in the dark. The Annexin V–
positive cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.

XP-C and XP-CþXPC cells growing on the coverslips were
either treated with UV or untreated. The cells were further
cultured for 24 hours and stained with MitoCapture reagents
(BioVision) according to the manufacture's instruction. Cells
were observed immediately under a Nikon Fluorescence
Microscope E80i (Nikon) ﬁtted with appropriate ﬁlters for
FITC and Texas Red. The digital images were then captured
with a cooled CCD camera and processed with the help of its
SPOT software (Diagnostic Instruments).

(Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's instruction.
Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR was conducted as described previously
(19). Special primers were designed to only amplify casp2S or casp-2L, for example, the forward sequence of casp-2S
primer covers the exon 9, whereas the forward sequence of
casp-2L primer covers the junction of exon 8 and 10. The
sequence of the primers is as follows: casp-2L: forward
50 -GCCTGCCGTGGAGATGAGACTGAT-30 ; casp-2S: forward

Promoter activity assay
Cells were transiently transfected with casp-2S promoterluciferase constructs (Del4). As an internal control, the pGL4.73
plasmid (Promega), which carries a Renilla luciferase gene, was
also cotransfected into the cells to normalize for transfection
efﬁciency. Luciferase assays were conducted with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to manufacturer's instruction.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
HCT116(p53/) cells were ﬁxed with 1% formaldehyde for
10 minutes at room temperature. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was conducted as described previously
(24) using 2 mg of either normal rabbit immunoglobulin G or
rabbit anti-XPC antibodies. The casp-2S promoter–speciﬁc
PCR reactions were carried out with 4 different pairs of primers
(Supplementary Data).

Results
XPC facilitates DNA damage–induced apoptosis
Because our results (Supplementary Data S1A and B and
S2A–D) and others (6, 7) have shown that XPC-deﬁcient cells

have lower UV and cisplatin sensitivity than other NERdeﬁcient cells, we wanted to determine whether XPC-deﬁcient cells are also resistant to DNA damage–induced apoptosis. A SV40-transformed human XP-C cell line and its
stably XPC-restored counterpart were used to investigate
the role of XPC protein in various DNA-damaging agent–
induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1A–D, following treatment with diverse DNA-damaging agents, XPC-restored cells
exhibited enhanced apoptosis than parental XPC-deﬁcient
cells, as reﬂected by the characteristic increase of PARP
cleavage in these cells. Enhanced UV-induced apoptosis in
XPC-restored cells was also conﬁrmed by Annexin V staining
(Fig. 1E) and sub-G1 cell analysis (Supplementary Data S3).
Furthermore, we transiently transfected XPC cDNA-containing plasmids into XP-C cells and again found the increased
apoptosis upon UV irradiation compared with the empty
vector–transfected XP-C cells (Supplementary Data S4A and
B). To further conﬁrm the independent role of XPC in
apoptosis, without the potential inﬂuence via its canonical
function in NER, we knocked down the expression of XPC in
NER-deﬁcient XP-A cells and analyzed their apoptosis upon
UV irradiation. Our ﬁndings indicated that XPC-deﬁciency
compromised UV-induced apoptosis in XP-A cells which are

completely deﬁcient in both GGR and TCR (Fig. 1F and G).
These observations showed that XPC protein can facilitate
DNA damage–induced apoptosis independent of its known
function in DNA repair.
XPC-mediated apoptosis occurs without an inﬂuence by
p53
The above-mentioned data were obtained from SV40transformed XP-C and XP-A cells, in which the transcriptional properties of p53 are suppressed. To further investigate the role of an involvement of p53 in the XPC-mediated
apoptosis, we analyzed the effect of XPC deﬁciency on
UV-induced cellular apoptosis in the presence or absence
of p53. XPC shRNA was stably transfected into 041-TR cells
carrying tetracycline (Tet)-regulated p53 and 2 new cell lines
with downregulated XPC were established (Fig. 2A). These
cell lines were irradiated with UV either in the presence or
absence of Tet, and the apoptosis was analyzed by PARP
cleavage and Annexin V staining. As shown in Fig. 2B–E, XPC
knockdown compromised UV-induced apoptosis when p53
is eliminated by Tet, while it had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
apoptosis when p53 was present and responded normally to
induction by DNA damage. This ﬁnding was also conﬁrmed
in HCT116 cells with differing status of p53 (Supplementary
Data S5A–D). These data indicated that XPC-mediated
apoptosis is independent of functional p53, and this novel
effect can be obscured by the regular p53-mediated
apoptosis.
XPC functions downstream of mitochondrial events in
facilitating apoptosis
For insights into the mechanism by which XPC protein
enhances apoptosis, we focused on the contribution of XPC
to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. We ﬁrst analyzed cyto c
release from mitochondria following UV irradiation of XPCdeﬁcient and XPC-proﬁcient cells. As shown in Fig. 3A,
despite the higher level of apoptosis in XPC-proﬁcient cells
as reﬂected by increased PARP cleavage, UV irradiation
caused a comparable release of cyto c into cytosol fraction
from both cell lines. Furthermore, we analyzed the disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and
found that both XPC-deﬁcient and XPC-proﬁcient cells
displayed the similar diffused green ﬂuorescence upon UV
irradiation (Fig. 3B), further supporting that XPC protein
does not inﬂuence DNA damage–induced mitochondrial
permeabilization, and indicated that XPC could be playing
its role at steps downstream of cyto c release during apoptotic cascade. We then determined the activation of various
caspases functioning in the downstream of cyto c release in
both XP-C and XP-CþXPC cells following UV irradiation. As
shown in Fig. 3C and D, casp-2L, casp-6, and casp-9 activation prominently coincided with the enhanced PARP cleavage of XPC-proﬁcient cells, whereas casp-3 and casp-7
activation was comparable in XP-C and XP-CþXPC cells.
This suggested that XPC-mediated apoptosis might be
occurring through the enhanced activation of casp-2L,
casp-9, and casp-6. Furthermore, we also found that pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD blocked, whereas casp-3 inhibitor

blotting. C, Tet was withdrawn from the culture of 041-TR cells

absence of Tet for 24 hours. Cleaved PARP was detected.

z-DEVD had no inﬂuence on UV-induced apoptosis in both
XP-C and XP-CþXPC cells, although casp-3 activity was
higher in XP-CþXPC cells than XP-C cells upon UV irradiation (Supplementary Data S6A–D). This indicates that the
functional role of casp-3 in UV-induced apoptosis in XP-C
cells is apparently being substituted by other executor
caspases.

XPC inhibits the expression of casp-2S through
repressing casp-2S promoter activity
Casp-2 exists as 2 distinct isoforms, proapoptotic casp-2L
and antiapoptotic casp-2S (17, 18). So, we determined the
effects of XPC on the expression of both casp-2L and casp2S in cultured cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, in contrast to casp-2L,
casp-2S protein was upregulated in XPC-deﬁcient cells, indicating that XPC protein inhibits the expression of casp-2S.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis further indicated that XPC repressed the transcription
of casp-2S without an inﬂuence on casp-2L transcription
(Fig. 4B and C). To further conﬁrm the inhibitory effect of
XPC on the expression of casp-2S, we transiently transfected
various amounts of XPC cDNA-containing constructs into
XP-C cells, or down-regulated XPC expression by transfecting
XPC siRNA into HCT116(p53/) cells, and determined the
protein levels of casp-2S and casp-2L. As expected, with
the increase of XPC expression, casp-2S showed decreased
level whereas casp-2L level did not change. Similarly, with the
decrease of XPC expression, casp-2S exhibited increased level
and again casp-2L level kept constant (Fig. 4D and E).
It has been reported that casp-2S can be transcribed from
an alternate promoter within intron 1 of the casp-2 gene
(21, 22). Thus, we used the casp-2S promoter-luciferase
reporter construct, described earlier (21, 22), to investigate
the repressive effect of XPC on the casp-2S promoter activity.
Our data showed that XPC expression led to a substantial
decrease in the reporter activity from the construct containing casp-2S promoter (Del4; Fig. 4F), indicating that XPC

670

may reduce the synthesis of casp-2S pre-mRNA. We further
detected the inﬂuence of downregulation of XPC on the
activity of casp-2S promoter in HCT116 cells. As shown
in Fig. 4G, knockdown of XPC increased the casp-2S promoter activity in HCT116 cells. To gain insight into the
mechanism through which XPC regulates casp-2S promoter
activity, we conducted ChIP assay to investigate whether
XPC protein directly binds to the putative casp-2S promoter
(–3,006–1,952) site (21). As shown in Fig. 4H, the strong casp2S promoter (Seq 1–4), but not casp-2 exon-10 PCR product,
in anti-XPC antibody-recruited DNA fragment indicated the
enrichment of XPC to casp-2S promoter. Taken together,
these data showed that XPC protein speciﬁcally regulates
the expression of antiapoptotic casp-2S by directly binding
to casp-2S promoter region and inhibiting its activity.
Enhanced casp-2S is responsible for the resistance of
XPC-deﬁcient cells to apoptosis
Earlier it has been reported that casp-2 is required for stressinduced apoptosis (25). However, that study could not have
separated the roles of casp-2L and casp-2S because the siRNA
used in their experiments actually targeted both casp-2L and
casp-2S (25). By the siRNA targeting of casp-2L and casp-2S
(Supplementary Data S7A and B) and casp-2 inhibition (Supplementary Data S7C), we failed to ﬁnd any inﬂuence of casp-2
downregulation on UV-induced apoptosis in both XP-C and
XP-CþXPC cells observed in this study.
To speciﬁcally investigate the role of casp-2S in XPCmediated apoptosis, we designed an siRNA that only targeted

cells, but not in XPC-proﬁcient cells (Fig. 5C and D). Notably,
we were unable to observe any inﬂuence of casp-2S knockdown
on the casp-2L activation. The above results showed that XPC
enhances apoptosis through downregulation of antiapoptotic
casp-2 short isoform, which is an inhibitor of casp-9 and casp-6
activation.
XPC overexpression enhances cisplatin-induced
apoptosis in various cancer cell lines
To determine whether the level of XPC affects chemotherapeutic agent–induced apoptosis in human cancer
cells, we overexpressed XPC in various human cancer cell
lines of different p53 status and analyzed cisplatininduced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 6, XPC overexpression
enhanced the cisplatin-induced apoptosis in p53-deﬁcient
human ovarian carcinoma cells SKOV3 and human non–
small cell lung carcinoma cells H1299, as well as p53
heterozygous ovarian carcinoma cells A2780/CP70. However, XPC overexpression did not exhibit augmented apoptosis in p53-proﬁcient A549 cells upon cisplatin treatment.
These data indicated that elevation of XPC level in p53deﬁcient cancer cells can overcome their resistance to
cisplatin.

XPC Enhances Apoptosis through Reducing Caspase-2S

Discussion
XPC deﬁciency has been associated with cancer predisposition in both human and animal models (26–30). Deﬁcient
NER is established as the main contributor to the increasing
cancer rates. Here, we have provided evidence showing that
XPC protein can also enhance DNA damage–induced apoptosis. Thus, the loss of XPC-mediated apoptotic pathway could
also be a contributory factor in the cancer susceptibility of
XPC-deﬁcient individuals.
The resistance of XPC-deﬁcient cells to apoptosis was
initially attributed to the proﬁcient TCR in these cells (6, 7).
The intact TCR pathway removes UV- or cisplatin-induced
DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of the active genes,
thus eliminates the apoptosis triggers. However, our data
show that XPC-deﬁcient cells are not only resistant to
apoptosis induced by UV and cisplatin treatment, which
induce DNA lesions repaired by NER, but also resistant to
apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation (IR) and etoposide,
which induce double strand breaks (DSB). Given the putative role of XPC in the repair of DSBs (31), XPC-deﬁcient
cells should have more DNA lesions, or in other words
apoptosis triggers, than XPC-proﬁcient cell. Therefore, the
compromised apoptosis, in response to IR and etoposide in
XPC-deﬁcient cells, could not be attributed to diminished
apoptosis signals. This indicates that XPC protein may
participate in apoptosis process through a novel function
beyond its canonical role in DNA repair. Furthermore, our
ﬁnding that downregulation of XPC in XP-A cells compromised UV-induced apoptosis further reinforced this notion.
Because XP-A cell line is deﬁcient in both GGR and TCR, the
knockdown of XPC expression does not further reduce
its NER efﬁciency, and the DNA lesions in the entire
genome including transcribed and nontranscribed strands
are comparable between XPC-knockdown and XPCproﬁcient XP-A cells. Thus, the reduced apoptosis in XPA cells transfected with XPC siRNA can only be attributed
to the loss of XPC protein and indicates that XPC participates in DNA damage–induced apoptosis independent
of NER.
It was previously reported that XPC protein plays an
essential role in cisplatin-induced apoptosis, perhaps
through the activation of p53- and p73-dependent apoptotic
pathways (32). Here, we have identiﬁed a new pathway in
which XPC is shown to enhance DNA damage–induced
apoptosis in the absence of functional p53. More interestingly, XPC seems to enhance apoptosis only when p53
function is deﬁcient, indicating that XPC is redundant in
cisplatin- or UV-induced apoptosis in the presence of functional p53, probably because the dominant p53-driven apoptosis obscures the underlying contribution of the XPC
protein. Therefore, the role of this XPC-casp-2S pathway,
similar to the role of p73 pathway (33), is not critical to
apoptosis in the cells with wild-type p53. However, considering the high p53 mutation prevalence among human
tumors, induction of XPC-mediated apoptosis pathway
offers a unique strategy for sensitizing p53-deﬁcient tumors
to cancer therapy.

Although we were unable to alter UV-induced apoptosis
by casp-2 siRNA that targets both casp-2L and casp-2S, we
clearly showed that speciﬁc knockdown of casp-2S overcomes the resistance of XPC-deﬁcient cells to apoptosis. As
indicated above, casp-2 exists as 2 distinct isoforms with
opposing functions: casp-2L induces while casp-2S inhibits
cell death upon overexpression (17, 18). Because both isoforms were knocked out or downregulated simultaneously in
casp-2 knockout mice studies and the RNA interference cell
culture studies, the biological function of these 2 casp-2
isoforms, especially the antiapoptotic function of casp-2S
was not clariﬁed (34). In addition, the results about the
antiapoptotic function of casp-2S obtained by overexpression experiments are also controversial (18, 21, 35). By a
speciﬁc casp-2S siRNA designed in this study, we have
unambiguously revealed that downregulation of casp-2S can
enhance UV-induced apoptosis in XPC-deﬁcient cells, but
not XPC-proﬁcient cells. This indicates that the cellular
endogenous XPC level plays a critical role in investigations
of the function of casp-2S by manipulation of cellular casp2S levels.
The expression of casp-2S can be regulated by alternative
promoter activation (21). It has been reported that p73 is
able to speciﬁcally transactivate the expression of casp-2S
through directly binding to a Sp-1 binding site–containing
region in the promoter of casp-2S. In contrast, our data
clearly showed that the binding of XPC protein to casp-2S

Figure 7. A schematic model for XPC function in the enhancement of DNA
damage–induced apoptosis cascade. XPC protein represses the
transcription of antiapoptotic casp-2S through inhibiting casp-2
promoter activity. The downregulation of casp-2S attenuates its
antiapoptosis effect, thus enhances DNA damage–triggered casp-9 and
casp-6 activation, and ultimately augments apoptosis.

promoter inhibits casp-2S expression. Given XPC is able to
regulate gene transcription in 2 opposite ways with different
mechanisms (14, 15), it is possible that XPC can function as a
direct transcriptional repressor of casp-2S.
In summary, XPC protein is proposed to enhance DNA
damage–induced apoptosis through intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Fig. 7). XPC protein downregulates the expression of
antiapoptotic casp-2S through inhibiting its promoter activity.
The downregulation of casp-2S would attenuate its inhibitory
effect on the activation of casp-9 and casp-6, resulting in
augmented apoptosis.
