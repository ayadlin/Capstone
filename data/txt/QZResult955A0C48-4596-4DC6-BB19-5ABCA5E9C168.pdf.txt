Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on
Depressive Symptoms in Men With
Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer
Narhari Timilshina, MPH1; Henriette Breunis, CRA1; and Shabbir Alibhai, MD, MSc1,2,3,4

BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of prostate cancer (PC) patients receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), often for
several years. Although depression has been reported after a diagnosis of PC, whether ADT leads to or worsens
depression is not clear. METHODS: Three groups were assembled: ADT users (men initiating continuous ADT), PC
controls (PC patients who were not on ADT), and healthy controls. All 3 cohorts were matched on age, education,
and physical function, and none had metastases. Depression was measured at study entry and again at 3, 6, and 12
months using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Our primary outcomes were worsening depressive symptoms and incident depression (defined as a GDS score 5), analyzed using adjusted linear regression and logistic
regression, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 257 participants (mean age, 69.1 years), baseline characteristics including
GDS score and prior depression were similar across cohorts. In adjusted analyses of initially nondepressed patients,
ADT use was not a significant predictor of change in GDS score at 3 months (P ¼ .42), 6 months (P ¼ .25), or 12
months (P ¼ 0.19). Among ADT users, 8%-9% of participants developed incident depression compared with 0%-4%
among PC controls and 4%-6% among healthy controls over 3-12 months (P>.05 at all time points). In a separate
analysis of patients with depression at baseline, there was no effect of ADT on depressive symptoms at 3, 6, or 12
months (P ¼ .11, .74, and .12, respectively). CONCLUSION: Twelve months of ADT use were not associated with
worsening depressive symptoms among nondepressed or depressed patients with nonmetastatic PC. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common nonskin malignancy, with more than 200,000 cases diagnosed in 2010.1
More than 80% of cases occurred in men >65 years of age. A cancer diagnosis can mean a significant threat to the patient
and evoke strong psychological responses. In addition to developing PC, many of these men, by virtue of being middleaged or elderly, are experiencing other significant stresses, such as the death of a spouse, retirement, loss of health due to
comorbid illness, and so forth.2
Depression often follows a diagnosis of cancer. Pirl3 suggested that depression is seen in approximately 10%-25% of
patients with various kinds of cancer. Similarly, Roth et al4 found that the prevalence of depression was 15.2% among
men with PC. Various other studies have suggested that depression can lead to decreased medical adherence as well as
increased hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality.5-7 Therefore, it is important to understand psychiatric comorbidities in
patients with cancer.
Based in large part on clinical trial evidence for improved outcomes, approximately 50% of PC patients will receive
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at some point after diagnosis; most will take it for at least 2-3 years.8-10 The most
common adverse effects of ADT include fatigue, hot flashes, loss of sexual interest, anemia, decreased muscle mass, and
osteoporosis.9,11,12 ADT may also affect the brain, given the widespread distribution of both estrogen and testosterone
receptors in the brain.13-15 Minor cognitive changes have been described after 3-12 months of treatment.14,16,17

ADT and Depression in Prostate Cancer/Timilshina et al

Many men who are on ADT also describe emotional
lability and related psychological changes, including
depressed mood.18 Given that older patients who have
cancer and are on ADT are vulnerable to depression, and
given the negative impact of depression on quality of life,
medical adherence, and morbidity, this relationship is important to clarify. However, few studies have examined
the impact of ADT on depression. These studies have generally included men with advanced disease, featured small
sample sizes, lacked appropriate controls, and had varying
periods of follow-up (range, 0-12 months), limiting the
interpretation of findings.19-22 Therefore, the impact of
ADT on depression remains unclear, particularly in men
with nonmetastatic disease, which is presently the most
common indication for ADT.
We examined both depressive symptoms and incident depression outcome as prespecified secondary outcomes in a prospective matched cohort study of men with
PC evaluated from the time of initiation of ADT along
with 2 control groups. Based in part on previous publications reviewed above,19,20 we hypothesized that ADT use
would be associated with worsening depression in men
with nonmetastatic PC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study is a secondary analysis from a prospective
cohort study. Our primary outcomes were physical function, quality of life, and cognitive function, which have
been published recently.12,16
Three separate cohorts were enrolled from PC and
urology clinics at the Princess Margaret Hospital, a major
academic cancer center in Toronto, Canada. ADT users
consist of men who were initiating continuous ADT for at
least 1 year. Two controls groups were also enrolled, consisting of men with PC who were not on ADT (PC controls) and healthy cohorts without PC. All 3 cohorts were
matched for age, education, and baseline physical function. All men with PC had nonmetastatic disease.
Patients were excluded if they had another active
malignancy, had a life expectancy of less than 1 year, had a
major neuropsychiatric abnormality (including active,
severe depression, but not previously treated or current
nonsevere depression), or were unable to ambulate without assistance. All of the patients provided written
informed consent. The study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board.
Patients were asked to complete questionnaires at
study entry, providing socio-demographic, comorbidity,23

and medication information. PC-specific information
(including prostate-specific antigen [PSA] values) were
obtained from the patient’s medical record. Height and
weight were measured using standardized instruments at
baseline to compute body mass index. Follow-up questionnaires were administered at 3 months, 6 months, and
12 months. Loss to follow-up was minimal.12
Depression Measurements
Patients in all 3 cohorts completed the 15-item version of
the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)24 at 4 time points
over 12 months. Yesavage et al.24 designed the GDS to be
a rapid and reliable screening tool for depression in older
adults. The short version of GDS consists of 15 ‘‘yes/no’’
question, with a score of 5 suggestive of depression and
score of >10 indicating moderate to severe depression.
The GDS has been extensively validated in adults aged 65
years or older25,26 and in middle-aged patients >40 years
old.27,28 Based on a recent meta-analysis, a cut-off of 5
on the 15-item GDS has a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 78.4% when compared with a validated psychiatric diagnosis.25,29 Although responsiveness of the GDS
does not appear to have been formally assessed,30 based
on statistical grounds a 1-point change in GDS score
would be considered a small to moderate change.31 At the
baseline visit, the GDS was administered to measure the
level of depressive symptoms. Participants were re-evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months.
Our primary outcomes were change in depressive
symptoms (GDS score) and the development of incident
depression (defined as a GDS score 5 in a previously
nondepressed patient). At each visit, we also asked the
patient about any new antidepressant or other psychiatric
medication prescriptions or a physician diagnosis of
depression.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive analyses of baseline characteristics were conducted to compare the 3 cohorts. Continuous data were
reported as the mean  SD or median and interquartile
range depending on the distribution of the data. Frequencies were reported for categorical data. To compare baseline characteristics across the 3 cohorts, analysis of
variance and chi-square tests were used for continuous
and categorical variables, respectively.
Patients with prevalent depression (defined as a
GDS score 5, previous physician diagnosis of depression, or antidepressant medication use) at baseline were

The mean GDS score at baseline and change in
depression score at 3, 6, and 12 months were evaluated.
Multivariable linear regression was used to examine for differences in change in GDS score across cohorts over time,
adjusting for age, education, smoking, alcohol use, income,
and baseline GDS score. These covariates were selected
based on clinical judgment using variables from the
literature that were associated with depression in other populations. We also examined whether the proportion of
patients developing incident depression were different
across cohorts using Fisher’s exact tests and pair-wise contrasts between ADT users and healthy controls; this was a

1942

prespecified analysis. Given the few events, we did not
attempt multivariable logistic regression modeling. In an exploratory analysis, we examined the impact of PSA progression over 12 months on GDS score.
In a subset analysis of patients with prevalent depression, we examined whether ADT led to changes in GDS
scores compared with PC controls and healthy controls.
However, because few patients had prevalent depression,
this analysis was primarily descriptive, and multivariable
modeling was not performed.
All data were entered in duplicate in electronic
databases. Statistical analyses were performed using the
SAS statistical package version 9.1 (SAS institute Inc.,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics of Patients
Of the 260 enrolled participants, 257 completed the baseline GDS assessment. Patients ranged from 60-80 years of
age (mean, 69.1 years; SD 7.0 years). The majority of
patients were white (87.3%) and had a mean of 15.3 years
of formal education. Most baseline characteristics were
similar across cohorts at baseline (Table 1). At baseline,
ADT users had slightly higher GDS scores than PC controls or healthy controls (mean, 1.75, 1.00, and 1.49,
respectively; P ¼ .062) (Table 2). PSA levels were higher
in ADT users (P ¼ .001) compared with PC controls, but
comorbidity (as measured by the Charlson score23) was
not different among the 3 cohorts (P ¼ .41).
Eighteen men (7%) met the criteria for prevalent
depression at baseline and were thus excluded from the
main analyses. There were similar numbers of men with
prevalent depression in each cohort (P ¼ .24) (Table 1).

(Table 2) among patients who did not have prevalent
depression. The proportion of patients developing incident depression among ADT users was approximately 9%
compared with 4% in PC controls and 6% in healthy controls over 12 months (Table 3). Pairwise contrasts
between ADT users and healthy controls showed no difference in the incidence of depression at either 3 (P ¼
.52), 6 (P ¼ .32), or 12 months (P ¼ .53). Four men
started an antidepressant medication between the baseline
and 12-month visits (2 ADT users, 1 PC control, and 1
healthy control). PSA progression, analyzed as a continuous or categorical variable, was not associated with change
in GDS score over time (data not shown).

Depression
Among patients with prevalent depression, ADT use did
not appear to be associated with any impact in the change

DISCUSSION
We examined the changes over 12 months in depressive
symptoms using a validated self-reported questionnaire in
ADT users, PC controls, and healthy controls. This prospective study demonstrated that ADT does not appear to
be associated with an increased risk of depression over 12
months compared with controls in men who were not
depressed at baseline. Additionally, among patients with
prevalent depression at baseline, ADT use did not appear
to be associated with a significant worsening of depressive
symptoms.
Previous studies reporting on the risk of depression
in patients with PC receiving ADT are primarily restricted
to case series32 or uncontrolled studies with small samples.
For example, in an early report, Higano et al33 studied 22
men on intermittent ADT. In this study, depressive symptoms were reported by patients or their spouses, and formal quality of life or depression questionnaires were not
used. In 2 studies, Pirl et al examined depressive symptoms in up to 52 ADT users.19,20 In 1 study, 26.3% of
subjects had metastatic disease.20 None of the above studies had a control group of either men with PC who were
not using ADT or healthy controls.19,20,33 A large population-based study by Shahinian et al34 assessed the risk of
depression in a large sample of men with and without PC.
In their study, men with or without PC developed depression in similar proportions (9.6% and 9.5%, respectively),
but depression was more frequent among ADT users than
nonusers with PC (12.1%; P<.001). However, the excess
risk of depression was substantially attenuated after adjusting
for comorbidity, tumor characteristics, and age (relative risk,
1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.15),34 and depression
was diagnosed based on unvalidated diagnostic codes.
Our rates of incident and prevalent depression are
slightly lower than those reported by Pirl et al20 and Roth

1944

et al,4 although many of their patients had advanced PC
and greater comorbidity and were older than our study
participants, which may explain the differences.
Although our findings appear somewhat discrepant with those of other authors, as mentioned earlier,
most previous studies lacked control groups. Several
authors have noted that conditions such as depression
may be due to the cancer itself or to other medical
comorbid conditions.35,36 Hence there is a need to
include controls, ideally both with and without PC.
Although Shahinian et al34 found a slightly higher
rate of depression among ADT users compared with
controls, the relationship was attenuated after adjustment for age, stage, and comorbidity. Additionally,
the diagnosis of depression was based on administrative data coding rather than more validated methods
such as screening questionnaires or structured psychiatric interviews. These differences likely account for
the slightly different results observed between studies.
To our knowledge, no previous prospective study
has examined the impact of ADT on depressive symptoms
in men with prevalent depression. If ADT is indeed associated with worsening depressive symptoms and/or incident depression, one would expect that men with
prevalent depression might be at even greater risk of worsening depressive symptoms. This was not observed in our
study, suggesting that our finding of a lack of effect of
ADT on depressive symptoms in men without prevalent
depression is likely real. However, there are several limitations that must be considered. Our study featured a relatively small cohort of patients, which might lead to us
missing a small increased risk of depression. Equally important, we examined depressive symptoms rather than
clinical depression. Although the GDS has very good sensitivity and specificity, ideally any patients who are screenpositive (ie, GDS scores 5) should be evaluated by a psychiatrist to exclude other factors such as fatigue and effects
of physical illness. Finally, our cohort included relatively
few men with prevalent depression and excluded men

with severe active depression from study participation.
Thus, our observations on the effects of ADT in men with
prevalent depression must be interpreted cautiously and
warrant confirmation in other studies.
In conclusion, our study suggests that 12 months of
ADT use is not associated with worsening depressive
symptoms or greater incident depression in men with
nonmetastatic PC. These findings should be reassuring to
primary care physicians and PC clinicians who manage
the adverse affects of ADT during long-term follow-up of
men with PC. Conversely, in men with significant depressive symptoms who are on ADT, other causes should be
considered, and these men may benefit from formal psychiatric evaluation.
