Abstract
Tetraspanin CD151 is associated with laminin-binding integrins and controls tumor cell migration and
invasion. By analyzing responses of breast cancer cells to various growth factors, we showed that depletion of CD151 specifically attenuates transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1)–induced scattering and proliferation of breast cancer cells in three-dimensional Matrigel. CD151-dependent cell scattering requires its
association with either α3β1 or α6 integrins, but it is independent of the recruitment of CD151 to tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. We also found that CD151 regulates the compartmentalization of TGF-β
type I receptor (TβRI/ALK-5) and specifically controls the TGFβ1-induced activation of p38. In contrast,
signaling leading to activation of Smad2/3, c-Akt, and Erk1/2 proteins was comparable in CD151(+) and
CD151(−) cells. Attenuation of TGFβ1-induced responses correlated with reduced retention in the lung
vascular bed, inhibition of pneumocyte-induced scattering of breast cancer cells in three-dimensional Matrigel, and decrease in experimental metastasis to the lungs. These results identify CD151 as a positive
regulator of TGFβ1-initiated signaling and highlight the important role played by this tetraspanin in
TGFβ1-induced breast cancer metastasis. Cancer Res; 70(14); 6059–70. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Tetraspanin protein CD151/Tspan24 is a member of a
large family of four transmembrane domain proteins, which
directly interacts with laminin-binding integrins (i.e., α3β1,
α6β1/β4, and α7β1; refs. 1, 2). It affects their ligand-binding
properties, thus regulating adhesion-dependent signaling and
postadhesion events including cell migration (3). In addition,
it has been shown that CD151 regulates the internalization of
the associated integrins, a process that is integral to cell
motility (4). Finally, we have recently reported that CD151
specifically affects glycosylation pattern of α3β1, and
CD151-dependent differences in glycosylation of this integrin
contribute to the modulatory activity of CD151 toward this
integrin (5).
In addition to this CD151 regulates activity of lamininbinding integrins through tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TERM or TEM), molecular aggregates on the plasma

membrane, which include other tetraspanins and cytoplasmic signaling proteins (3). Association with CD151 is critical
for the recruitment of laminin-binding integrins to TERM,
where they can cooperate with other TERM-associated transmembrane proteins (6).
Cooperation between integrins and receptors to various
growth and chemotactic factors is well established and occurs at multiple levels (7, 8). This involves cell type–specific
association of various integrins with growth factor/
chemokine receptors (GF-/ChR), integrin-mediated control
over ligand-induced activation of GF-/ChR, and adhesiondependent modulation of signaling pathways downstream
of activated GF-/ChR. Integrin-associated transmembrane
proteins including CD47, tetraspanins, and the L6-Ag family
members can all function as mediators in communication
between integrins and GF-/ChR (3, 9–11). We and others
have previously described the association of tetraspanins
with transmembrane receptors to growth factors including
epidermal growth factor receptor (12, 13), receptor to hepatocyte growth factor (c-Met; ref. 14), and receptor for Steel
factor (c-Kit; ref. 15). Furthermore, it has been proposed
that tetraspanin microdomains may represent a focal point
in which signaling through integrins and receptors for
growth/chemotactic factors can be coordinated (3). Indeed,
it has been shown that adhesion-dependent cellular responses triggered by activated c-Met are regulated by tetraspanins CD82 and CD151 (14, 16). Likewise, CD81 and CD9
regulated adhesion-dependent proliferation in response to
fibroblast growth factor (17). In addition, tetraspanins
may target growth factor receptors independent of their
association with integrins (12, 14), and this may involve

tetraspanin-dependent changes in surface compartmentalization of the receptors (13, 18).
Here, we found that depletion of CD151 attenuated the
responses of breast cancer cells to transforming growth
factor β1 (TGFβ1) in three-dimensional extracellular matrix (ECM). This correlated with specific changes in the
TGFβ1-induced signaling leading to the activation of p38.
Importantly, we found that attenuated responses to TGFβ1
correlated with decreased retention of CD151-depleted
cells in the lungs, inhibition of tumor cell growth and scattering in coculture with lung epithelial cells, and, consequently, diminished metastatic burden of breast cancer
cells.

Materials and Methods
Cells, antibodies, and reagents
MDA-MB-231/CD151(+), MDA-MB-231/CD151(−), MDAMB-231/CD81(−), MDA-MB-231/α3β1 low , MDA-MB-231/
α6β4low, DCIS.com/CD151(+), and DCIS.com/CD151(−) cell
lines were generated using appropriate short hairpin RNA
lentiviral constructs with cells expressing low levels of the
target proteins being selected after cell sorting (5, 19, 20).
MDA-MB-231/CD151rec, MDA-MB-231/CD151palm, and
MDA-MB-231/CD151-QRD cell lines were established after
the transfection of MDA-MB-231/CD151(−) cells with the
wild-type and appropriate mutants of CD151 and subsequent
selection CD151-expressing cells by cell sorting (5). Cell lines
expressing low levels of α6 integrins (MDA-MB-231/α6lowβ1/
β4 and MDA-MB-231/α3β1lowα6lowβ1/β4) were established
by infecting of MDA-MB-231 and α3β1 low cells with
pLVTHM-based lentivirus encoding short hairpin RNA that
targets α6 integrin subunit (target sequence, 5′-GGUCGUGACAUGUGCUCAC-3′). To generate green fluorescent protein
(GFP)–expressing cells, MDA-MB-231/CD151(+) and MDAMB-231/CD151(−) were transduced with pLVTHM lentivirus
(encoding GFP), which was produced in 293T cells using a
standard protocol (20). All MDA-MB-231 and 293T cells were
grown in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). HPL1D cells (21) were cultured in
Ham F12 media with 5 μg/mL insulin, 5 μg/mL transferrin,
10−7 mol/L hydrocortisone, 2 × 10−7 mol/L thyronine, and 1%
of FBS. The mouse anti-CD151 monoclonal antibodies (mAb)
used were 5C11 (22), 11B1G4 (provided by Dr. L. Ashman,
University of Newcastle, Newcastle, Australia), and NCLCD151 (Novocastra). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against
TGFβR1 were from Santa Cruz; mouse mAb against β-actin
was from Sigma; and mouse mAb against β4 integrin subunit
(3E1) was from Chemicon. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to α3
and α6 integrin were generously provided by Dr. F. Watt
(Cambridge Research Institute, Cambridge, UK) and Dr. A.
Cress (Arizona Cancer Center, Tuscon, AZ). Mouse monoclonal to α3- (A3-IVA5), α6- (A6-ELE), and β1- (TS2/16) integrin
subunit were previously described (23–25). The rest of the
antibodies used in this study were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. All growth factors were purchased from
PeproTech. SB431542 was from Calbiochem.

Culturing cells in three-dimensional Matrigel
Cell culturing in three-dimensional Matrigel was previously described (20). In some experiments, cells were cultured
in endothelial basal medium (Promocell), which was supplemented with 2% FBS and various growth factors/chemokines (at 10 ng/mL); growth medium was replaced every
third day. To evaluate cell proliferation in three-dimensional
Matrigel, AlamarBlue (Invitrogen) was added at different
time points to the growth media and cells were further incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. Fluorescence of the samples
was measured using the Fluoroskan plate reader. In cell coculture experiments, HPL1D cells were grown in 48-well
plates until they reached 80% confluency: MDA-MB-231 cells
suspended in Matrigel (8 × 103/200 μL) were subsequently
overlaid and cultured for 7 to 10 days with growth media
(DMEM/10%FCS) being replaced every third day. In some
experiments, GFP-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells were premixed with HPL1D cells at the ratio 1:100 and incubated
for 30 to 60 minutes on a slowly rocking platform to induce
the formation of cell aggregates. Aggregates were carefully
suspended in Matrigel and cultured for 7 to 10 days. For
all three-dimensional culture experiments, representative
pictures were taken every 2 to 3 days using the Nikon
Eclipse TS100 microscope.
Analysis of TGFβ1-induced signaling
Cells spread on Matrigel-coated (10 μg/mL) culture plates
were serum starved overnight and subsequently stimulated
with 10 ng/mL TGFβ1 for different length of time. Cells were
lysed in the ice-cold Laemmli buffer supplemented with
2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, 100 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L
NaF, and 10 mmol/L Na3P4O7. Proteins separated by
SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane
and probed with various antibodies using a standard protocol.
Fractionation in sucrose gradient
Fractionation of cellular lysates in the gradient of sucrose was carried out as previously described (13, 18). In
brief, cells were homogenized in 100 mmol/L Na2CO3 (pH
11.0) by passing through a 25G hypodermic needle, and
the lysates were subsequently sonicated (4 × 20 s bursts,
1-min interval, power 20). The lysates were mixed with
two volumes of 2 mol/L sucrose solution and overlaid with
two sucrose solutions (35% and 5%). Samples were centrifuged
at 100,000 g for 16 to 18 hours at 4°C in a Beckman SW60 rotor,
and 10 equal volume fractions were collected from the top
of gradient. The pellet was suspended in 200 μL of the lysis
buffer. Equal amounts of each fraction were mixed with
4× Laemmli loading buffer, and the proteins were resolved
by SDS-PAGE. Fractional distribution of proteins was subsequently analyzed by Western blotting.
Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were detached with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer
(Life Technologies) and kept for 1 hour on ice with saturating
concentrations of appropriate mouse monoclonal antibodies.
Staining was visualized using phycoerythrin-conjugated goat

anti-mouse IgG antibodies, and samples were analyzed with
COULTER Epics XL.
Metastasis experiments
All experiments were performed in accordance with institutional and national animal research guidelines. Cells were
injected i.v. into the lateral tail vein of 4- to 5-week-old athymic mice to evaluate lung colonization. Mice were injected
with 5 × 105 cells/150 μL PBS/mouse. Six to 10 animals per
group were used in the experiments. The experiments were
terminated 8 weeks postinjection (or earlier if mice with adverse symptoms were observed). At termination, the lungs
were removed and fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed for histologic and immunohistochemical analyses.
Histology and morphometry
Paraffin sections of formalin-fixed lungs were processed
routinely for histology. The sections stained with H&E were
analyzed, and images were captured using the Nikon E400
DS-U2/L2 software (Japan). For quantitative analysis, four sections at the distance of 200 μm on either side of the hilum were
cut and immunostained for vimentin (DAKO) using a standard
avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. Metastatic foci
were counted in two low-power fields (4×) at each level, and
their area was quantified using the AxioVision LE software
(Zeiss). The numbers represent the average from eight counts
per measurements. The mean ± SEM was calculated, and statistical analyses were carried out by the unpaired t test using a
GraphPad Prism 3.2 program (GraphPad Software).
Analysis of tumor cell trafficking in vivo using
intravital microscopy
Male C57BL/6 mice were anaesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg Vetalar; Amersham Biosciences and
Upjohn Ltd.) and xylazine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg; Millpledge Pharmaceuticals). Animals subsequently underwent
carotid artery cannulation to allow administration of cells
fluorescently labeled with BCECF-AM (PPL 40/2749). Following laparotomy, the left hepatic lobe was exteriorized and visualized intravitally using an inverted fluorescent microscope
(Olympus). MDA-MB-231/CD151(+) or MDA-MB-231/CD151
(−) (1 × 106) cells were administered in a 100-μL bolus through
the carotid artery. Seven fields of view containing a postsinusoidal venule and surrounding sinusoidal capillaries were analyzed 1 hour postinjection of cells. Lung tissue was isolated
from sacrificed mice at the end of the intravital experiments.
Tissue was washed in 0.9% saline and also analyzed on the
inverted fluorescent microscope. Ten fields of view were selected in a set pattern, and adherent cells were counted.
The average from these 10 fields was obtained from each of
the five separate experiments.

Results
Depletion of CD151 affects the responses of breast
cancer cells to TGFβ1
We have analyzed whether the absence of CD151 can affect responses of breast cancer cells to various growth factors

www.aacrjournals.org

and chemokines. Initially, we used MDA-MB-231/CD151(+)
and MDA-MB-231/CD151(−) cells, and assessed the growth
of these cells in three-dimensional Matrigel. In agreement
with the previous studies, we found that depletion of
CD151 did not affect surface expression of predominant integrins in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Ten
growth/chemotactic factors were analyzed in these experiments including PDGF-BB, HB-EGF, EGF, bFGF, SDF-1,
TGFα, HGF, TGFβ1, IGF-I, and IL-1. Under the control conditions (i.e., in the absence of additional growth factors), both
MDA-MB-231/CD151(+) and MDA-MB-231/CD151(−) cells
formed compact round aggregates (Fig. 1A, top). The morphologic appearance of colonies was not affected when cells
were cultured in the presence of HGF, IL-1, EGF, IGF-I,
PDGF-BB, SDF1, HB-EGF, and TGFα (Supplementary
Fig. S2 and results are not shown). Tight intercellular interactions within aggregates were looser in the presence of
bFGF, but we observed no apparent difference between the
CD151(+) and CD151(−) cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). By
contrast, the CD151-dependent differential response was
seen when cells were grown in the presence of TGFβ1. While
<20% of CD151-positive aggregates retained compact morphology, the majority of colonies appeared as aggregates of
loosely associated cells, some of which developed characteristic thin protrusions (thereafter, we referred to this type
of colony as having a “scattered” phenotype; Fig. 1A, bottom
left). Short protrusions were first observed 4 days after cells
were seeded in Matrigel, and they gradually became more
prominent after 8 days in three-dimensional culture (Fig. 1B).
In contrast to CD151-positive cells, ∼80% of MDA-MB-231/
CD151(−) colonies remained compact and had smooth contours during the time course of the experiments (Fig. 1A,
bottom right, and C). Although there was no obvious difference between CD151-positive and CD151-negative cells in the
number of colonies formed in the presence of TGFβ1, the
proliferative rate of MDA-MB-231/CD151(−) cells appeared
to be consistently lower (Fig. 1D). Similarly, TGFβ1-induced
proliferation of another breast cancer cell line (DCIS.com)
was also attenuated after depletion of CD151 (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Importantly, the effect of CD151 depletion on
TGFβ1-induced signaling was specific as knockdown of tetraspanin CD81 did not change responses of MDA-MB-231
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). These data showed that
CD151 specifically regulates TGFβ1-induced responses of
breast cancer cells in three-dimensional Matrigel.
The role of CD151-associated integrins and tetraspanin
microdomains in regulating cellular responses
to TGFβ1
We and others have previously reported that in MDA-MB231 cells, the function of CD151 is closely linked to lamininbinding integrins (i.e., α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4; refs. 5, 20, 26).
To examine the involvement of these integrins in CD151dependent scattering induced by TGFβ1, we initially examined the responses of MDA-MB-231/CD151-QRD cells (5).
These cells were derivative of MDA-MB-231/CD151(−) line,
and they expressed the mutant of CD151 deficient in its
ability to form complexes with integrins (5). As illustrated

in Fig. 2, the response of MDA-MB-231/CD151-QRD cells
was comparable with that of the CD151-negative cells with
∼90% of all colonies remaining compact in the presence of
TGFβ1. By contrast, the response to TGFβ1 was restored
when MDA-MB-231/CD151(−) cells were reconstituted with
the wild-type CD151 (Fig. 2A and B). Flow cytometry experiments have shown that CD151-QRD and CD151wt proteins expressed at the comparable levels on the surface of
reconstituted MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Table S1).
We next investigated which of the laminin-binding integrins contribute to CD151-dependent responses of MDAMB-231 cells to TGFβ1. To this end, we have generated
two new cell lines: MDA-MB-231/α6β1/β4low, deficient in
expression of both α6 integrins (i.e., α6β1 and α6β4),
and MDA-MB-231/α3β1lowα6 β1/β4low, deficient in expression of all laminin-binding integrins (Supplementary Fig.
S1A). In these experiments, we also used α3β1-deficient
cells (MDA-MB-231/α3β1low; ref. 20). Surprisingly, both
MDA-MB-231/α3β1low and MDA-MB-231/α6β1/β4low cells

6062

Cancer Res; 70(14) July 15, 2010

were able to form colonies with characteristic scattered
appearance, and only deficiency in all CD151-associated integrins completely abolished responses to TGFβ1 (Supplementary Fig. S5; Fig. 2C). These results confirmed that the
modulatory activity of CD151 requires its association with
integrins and suggested functional redundancy of various
CD151-integrin complexes in TGFβ1-induced scattering.
Palmitoylation-dependent recruitment of the proteins to
tetraspanin-enriched microdomains is critical for many of
the tetraspanin activities (27). To investigate whether
palmitoylation of CD151 is necessary for TGFβ1-induced
responses, we analyzed the behavior of MDA-MB-231/
CD151palm(−) cells. As illustrated in Fig. 2D, expression
of palmitoylation-deficient CD151 in MDA-MB-231/CD151
(−) fully restored the ability of the cells to form scattered
colonies in the presence of TGFβ1. These results indicated
that the association with other tetraspanins (and recruitment to tetraspanin microdomains) was not essential for
CD151-dependent cellular responses to this cytokine.

The effect of CD151 depletion on
TGFβ1-induced signaling
Pleiotropic effects of TGFβ1 on cell behavior is mediated by
Smad proteins, which function as transcriptional modulators,
and through activation of several Smad-independent signaling
pathways involving P13-K, Erk1/2, and p38 kinases (28). To analyze how depletion of CD151 affects TGFβ1-induced signaling, we assessed phosphorylation of various TGFβ1 targets in
cells plated on Matrigel under serum-free conditions and subsequently stimulated with the cytokine for various time intervals. As expected, incubation with TGFβ1 resulted in the
phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3: the phosphorylation
levels of the proteins peaked at 1 hour after the stimulation
and then decreased to undetectable levels by 12 hours
(Fig. 3A and B). We observed no difference between CD151positive and CD151-negative cells in the kinetics and degree

of phosphorylation of Smad2/3 proteins in these experiments
(Fig. 3A and B). Thus, it seemed that CD151 does not influence
Smad-dependent signaling pathway. Similarly, phosphorylation levels of Erk1/2 and c-Akt were comparable at all analyzed
time points (data not shown; Fig. 3A and B). By contrast, there
was a consistent difference in TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation of p38. In MDA-MB-231/CD151(+) cells, after the initial
sharp increase (∼4-fold increase), the level of phospho-p38
has returned to its basal level (i.e., 0 time point) by 48 hours.
On the other hand, the degree of TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation of p38 in CD151-negative MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly lower when compared with nonstimulated cells, with
maximal ∼1.5-fold increase by 1 hour (Fig. 3A and C). Furthermore, p38 phosphorylation was sustained at almost the same
level for up to 48 hours. A specific CD151-dependent effect
on TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation of p38 was also observed

in DCIS.com cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). These results
showed that CD151 deficiency resulted in specific alterations
in TGFβ1-induced signaling. It has been recently reported
that TGFβ1-induced activation of p38 was influenced by
cholesterol-dependent redistribution of TGF-β type I receptor
(TβRI/ALK-5) on the plasma membrane (29). Fractionation in
sucrose gradient was used to examine whether the effect of
CD151 on p38 activation also involves changes in the membrane compartmentalization of TβRI/ALK-5. Although the
major pool of TβRI/ALK-5 molecules was found in the heavy
fractions of sucrose gradient, a significant proportion of the
receptor was floating in the light fractions (Fig. 3D). Importantly, we have consistently observed (three independent
experiments) that depletion of CD151 in MDA-MB-231 cells
resulted in the decrease in the proportion of TβRI/ALK-5 in

6064

the light fraction of the gradient. Control experiments have
shown that the total cellular levels of TβRI/ALK-5 were
comparable in CD151(+) and CD151(−) cells (Supplementary
Fig. S7). By contrast, fractional distribution of CD151 and
the associated integrins was different with most of the signal
detected in the fractions 3 to 6 (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, depletion of CD151 resulted in the redistribution of α3β1 in sucrose
gradient fractions. In additional experiments, we found no
evidence for the interaction between CD151 and TβRI/ALK-5
(data not shown).
Depletion of CD151 attenuates pulmonary metastasis of

CD151 Complexes in Breast Cancer Metastasis

a well-established experimental lung metastasis mouse
model (i.e., i.v. injection of tumor cells into the tail vein)
to examine whether attenuated responses to TGFβ1 in
MDA-MB-231/CD151(−) would correlate with decreased metastatic potential of these cells. We found that although
both CD151-positive and CD151-negative MDA-MB-231 cells
gave rise to multiple metastatic lesions in the lungs (Supplementary Fig. S8), the area occupied by the lesions and
their number were decreased in the absence of CD151
(Fig. 4A and B). In animals implanted with CD151-positive
cells an average relative area of all lesions in all examined
lung fields was ∼1.65%. In comparison, this parameter was
0.46% for mice injected with MDA-MB-231/CD151(−) cells.
These results indicate that CD151 is involved in establishing
and growth of metastatic lesions in the lungs.

three-dimensional Matrigel (Supplementary Fig. S9). To examine whether TGFβ1 is involved in pneumocyte-induced
scattering, we performed the coculturing experiment in the
presence of SB431542, a specific inhibitor for TβRI/ALK5.
As shown in Fig. 6B, the presence of SB431542 completely
abrogated the modulatory effect of pneumocytes on MDAMB-231 cells. Thus, we concluded that in the absence of
CD151, the responses of breast cancer cells to pneumocyte-derived TGFβ1 are suppressed, and this is likely to
be an important contributory factor for the attenuated metastatic properties of CD151-deficient cells.

Depletion of CD151 attenuates the immediate
trafficking of breast cancer cells to the lungs in vivo
Although the lung metastasis model allows assessment
of the metastatic process as a whole, it does not discriminate between different steps, which might be affected by
CD151. As a starting point toward uncovering the involvement of CD151 in metastasis, we analyzed whether CD151
regulates the immediate recruitment of breast cancer cells
to the vasculature of the lungs. MDA-MB-231/CD151(+)
and MDA-MB-231/CD151(−) cells were injected into the
mouse vascular system through the carotid artery, and
their immediate recruitment to the lung and liver microcirculation was monitored by intravital microscopy. The
liver was examined in addition to the lungs to determine
whether CD151 is involved in site-specific recruitment of
breast cancer cells. A significant reduction in lung recruitment of CD151-negative MDA-MB-231 cells was observed
(Fig. 5A and B). On the other hand, hepatic recruitment
of CD151-positive and CD151-negative MDA-MB-231 did
not differ during the 1-hour duration of the experiment
(Fig. 5B).
Depletion of CD151 attenuates responses of breast
cancer cells to lung epithelial cells
To explore further the involvement of CD151 in pulmonary metastasis, we compared responses of CD151-positive
and CD151-negative MDA-MB-231 to lung epithelial cells.
HPL1D is a human immortalized small airway epithelial
cell line with cells retaining some of the characteristics
of type II pneumocytes (21). In the initial experiments,
we analyzed growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in threedimensional Matrigel placed above the monolayer of
HPL1D pneumocytes. Under these conditions, most of
the MDA-MB-231/CD151(+) cells developed characteristic
scattered aggregates (Fig. 6A, top). These colonies morphologically resemble those induced by TGFβ1 (shown in
Fig. 1). In contrast, most of the CD151-negative cells were
nonresponsive to the presence of pneumocytes and formed
compact aggregates with smooth contours (Fig. 6A,
bottom). The CD151-dependent differential responses to
pneumocytes were also observed when we cultured preaggregated clusters of HPL1D and MDA-MB-231 cells in

Discussion
Cytokines of TGFβ superfamily are implicated in a variety of
normal and pathologic phenomena (31). Here, we identified
tetraspanin CD151 as a novel regulator of TGFβ-induced
signaling and showed that attenuated cellular responses to
TGFβ correlated with reduced metastastic potential of breast
cancer cells.

Our results indicate that the modulatory activity of
CD151 toward TGFβ1-induced cellular responses is dependent on its association with integrins and correlates with
the redistribution of TβRI/ALK5 on the plasma membrane.
Notably, this does not require recruitment of CD151 to tetraspanin microdomains, critical structural and functional
units on the cell surface (3). The fact that TβRI/ALK5
and CD151 do not interact with one another suggests

that the mode of regulation involves more general CD151dependent changes on the plasma membrane, which may,
as a result, affect the distribution of TGFβ receptors. In this
regard, not only does CD151 directly bind cholesterol (32),
but tetraspanins may also control the expression level and

compartmentalization of gangliosides (13), glycosphingolipids that represent the major structural block of various
types of membrane microdomains (33). It is also feasible
that in addition to its regulatory role in surface distribution
of TβRI/ALK5, CD151 (in complex with laminin-binding

integrins) can alter signaling downstream of the activated
receptor. Although this selective mode of action was not
previously associated with tetraspanins, it has been extensively documented for various integrin–growth factor receptor pairs (7, 9).
We found that TGFβ1-induced scattering (MDA-MB-231
cells) and proliferation (MDA-MB-231 and DCIS.com) of
CD151-deficient cells in three-dimensional Matrigel were
dramatically reduced when compared with the control,
CD151-positive cells. Attenuated responses to TGFβ1 in
CD151-depleted cells correlated with differences in TGFβinduced activation of p38. On the other hand, signaling
pathways leading to activation of Erk1/2, c-Akt, and phosphorylation of Smad2/3 were not affected in CD151(−) cells.
Although CD151-dependent variations in the activation of
p38 may not be the only factor that underlies differential
responses to TGFβ1, they can certainly contribute to
CD151-dependent phenotypes in three-dimensional Matrigel. Indeed, a proproliferative function of p38 in various
types of cancer cells is well established (34). Although there
seems to be no study that specifically addressed the involvement of p38 in scattering of cells in three-dimensional
ECM, activation of this enzyme can certainly contribute to
this phenomenon. In this regard, it has been recently reported that TGFβ-induced transcription of matrix metalloproteinase 2, an enzyme which plays an important role in
pericellular proteolysis of ECM by mammary epithelial cells,
is controlled by ATF2, a well-established target for p38 (35).
Furthermore, activation of p38 was shown to be critical for
TGFβ1-induced activation MT1-MMP/MMP-14 (36), a key
enzyme for invasive migration within three-dimensional
ECM (37). p38 is also known to regulate expression levels
and turnover of various cell-cell adhesion proteins and
therefore may further contribute to the development of
“scattering phenotype” in response to TGFβ1 treatment
(38–40). In spite of this, it seems that by itself, modulation
of p38 activity in response to TGFβ1 is not sufficient to induce cell scattering in three-dimensional ECM. Indeed, although TGFβ1 could potently induce the activation of
p38 in DCIS.com/CD151(+), the colonies formed by the cells
in three-dimensional Matrigel in the presence of this
growth factor did not exhibit typical scattering phenotype
(i.e., loosening cell-cell contacts, developing characteristic
invasive protrusions). These data strongly suggest that
TGFβ1-induced activation of p38 and its contribution to
scattering in three-dimensional ECM relies on other signaling pathways that are either absent or not fully functional
in DCIS.com cells.
Although as a whole, cellular interactions with LN-111 in
Matrigel matrix are essential, the function of each of the
laminin-binding integrins in developing of TGFβ1-induced
scattering phenotype by MDA-MB-231 cells seems to be redundant. Indeed, only in α3/α6-deficient MDA-MB-231
cells did we observe complete abrogation of the scattering
response to TGFβ1. The fact that MDA-MB-231/α6β1/
β4low cells are able to respond to TGFβ1 is particularly
intriguing and raises the question of how α3β1, the only
remaining laminin-binding integrin in these cells, supports

6068

Cancer Res; 70(14) July 15, 2010

scattering behavior. It is now well established that whereas
α6β1 and α6β4 integrins represent principal receptors for
LN-111 and can deliver biomechanical signals necessary for
scattering, α3β1 does not bind this substrate (41) and,
therefore, should utilize an alternative mode of action.
One possibility is that whereas other adhesion receptors
(and ECM components of Matrigel) in α6-deficient MDAMB-231 cells provide a “mechanical” support for scattering,
the CD151-α3β1 complex regulates the development of cell
protrusions and movement in three-dimensional ECM in
an adhesion-independent manner. Alternatively, in the absence of α6 integrins and upon treatment with TGFβ1,
α3β1 controls scattering by mediating adhesion to nonlaminin components of Matrigel (42). Further experiments
will be necessary to address this question.
Deficiency in responses to TGFβ1 correlated with impaired metastatic potential of CD151-depleted MDA-MB231 cells. Our observation is complementary to a recent
report showing that signaling induced by TGFβ through
the Smad-dependent pathway(s) is critical for recruitment
to and retention of breast cancer cells in the lungs (30).
Interestingly though, we found that in the absence of
CD151, TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation of Smad proteins
was not affected. Therefore, it is unlikely that the mechanisms underlying the prometastatic activity of CD151 involve the induction of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) as
shown by Padua and Massague (30). In fact, our data suggest that by potentiating cellular responses to TGFβ1
CD151 promotes the metastatic process at two levels: it
enhances cell proliferation and facilitates local invasiveness
(hence, increased size and number of metastatic lung lesions formed by CD151-positive cells).
Our results indicate that breast cancer cells, which express CD151, are more readily retained in the lung microvascular bed. These results revealed yet an additional
metastasis promoting function for CD151. Although relatively small CD151-dependent increase in the numbers of
tumor cells in the lung microvascular bed was highly reproducible and specific: indeed, we found that recruitment
of cells in the liver vasculature was independent of CD151
expression. These data further emphasize differences in the
molecular mechanisms underlying organ-specific recruitment during the metastatic process. A recent report by
Zijlstra and colleagues (43) has shown that CD151 may
contribute to metastasis by regulating intravasation of
the cells into the vascular system at the primary tumor
site. In their experiments, metastasis-suppressing antiCD151 mAb did not affect tumor cell arrest in the lungs
or alter growth of secondary colonies. Although these
“discrepancies” can be simply explained by differences in
the cell models used, it is also likely that the antibodyinduced inhibitory pathways may be distinct from the
intrinsic cellular mechanisms that control the metastatic
potential of tumor cells.
In conclusion, we have identified tetraspanin CD151 as a
new modulator of TGFβ1-induced signaling. Although in
this study, we have specifically focused on TGFβ-induced
responses of breast cancer cells, it is likely that a newly

established functional link between CD151 and TGFβ1 may
be in operation during the metastatic progression in many
other cancers in which elevated expression of the tetraspanin will sensitize cancer cells to TGFβ cytokines. Thus,
future experiments toward unraveling the molecular details
of the CD151-TGFβ1 communication will be necessary to
understand TGFβ-dependent cancerous progression.
