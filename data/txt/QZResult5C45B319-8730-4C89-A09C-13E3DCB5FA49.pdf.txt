ABSTRACT:
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a life-threatening stem cell disease
characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of myeloblasts. Using an
advanced RNAi screen-approach in an AML mouse model we have recently identified
the epigenetic ‘reader’ BRD4 as a promising target in AML. In the current study, we
asked whether inhibition of BRD4 by a small-molecule inhibitor, JQ1, leads to growthinhibition and apoptosis in primary human AML stem- and progenitor cells. Primary
cell samples were obtained from 37 patients with freshly diagnosed AML (n=23) or
refractory AML (n=14). BRD4 was found to be expressed at the mRNA and protein
level in unfractionated AML cells as well as in highly enriched CD34+/CD38- and
CD34+/CD38+ stem- and progenitor cells in all patients examined. In unfractionated
leukemic cells, submicromolar concentrations of JQ1 induced major growth-inhibitory
effects (IC50 0.05-0.5 µM) in most samples, including cells derived from relapsed or
refractory patients. In addition, JQ1 was found to induce apoptosis in CD34+/CD38−
and CD34+/CD38+ stem- and progenitor cells in all donors examined as evidenced
by combined surface/Annexin-V staining. Moreover, we were able to show that JQ1
synergizes with ARA-C in inducing growth inhibition in AML cells. Together, the BRD4targeting drug JQ1 exerts major anti-leukemic effects in a broad range of human
AML subtypes, including relapsed and refractory patients and all relevant stem- and
progenitor cell compartments, including CD34+/CD38− and CD34+/CD38+ AML cells.
These results characterize BRD4-inhibition as a promising new therapeutic approach
in AML which should be further investigated in clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

myeloblasts in the bone marrow (BM), blood, and other
organs. The clinical course and prognosis in AML vary,
depending on age, the biology and category of the disease,
cytogenetic features and number and types of deregulated
genes [1-6]. In a subset of patients, cytogenetic and/

or molecular features are indicative of a more favorable
prognosis. When treated with repeated chemotherapy
cycles or/and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(SCT), these patients have a relatively good prognosis and
many of them enter long-term disease-free survival [1-8].
However, not all patients with AML have a suitable donor
or are eligible for SCT. In other patients, the response to
chemotherapy is poor or short-lived. For AML patients
who relapse or have resistant disease, therapeutic options
are limited. Current research is seeking novel drug targets
and novel, more potent, drugs for these poor-risk patients
[9-13].
One key event in oncogenic transformation in
AML is the corruption of myeloid cell-fate programs
resulting in the generation of aberrantly self-renewing
cells, the so-called leukemic stem cells (LSC), which
maintain and propagate the disease and are often resistant
to conventional chemotherapy [14-16]. Notably, in
AML and other myeloid leukemias, the malignant clone
is organized hierarchically with more mature cells
programmed to undergo apoptosis after a variable number
of cell divisions, and immature primitive cells that have
self-renewing and leukemia-propagating capacity [14-18].
Although the exact phenotype of LSC in AML remains
uncertain, several studies have suggested that in various
AML subtypes, the NOD/SCID mouse-repopulating LSC
reside within a CD34+/CD38− fraction of the leukemic
clone [16-21]. Other studies have shown that NSG
mouse-repopulating AML stem cells reside in both the
CD34+/CD38+ and the CD34+/CD38− fraction of AML
cells, or even in CD34− subfractions of the clone [22,23].
Clinically, the LSC concept is of great importance and
may have prognostic and therapeutic implications [2432]. Notably, strategies aimed at terminating aberrant
self-renewal or survival of LSC are considered key to the
development of more effective therapies [26-32].
In an effort to systematically probe genes involved
in chromatin regulation as potential therapeutic targets,
we have recently developed an unbiased screen approach,
combining AML mouse models and new in vivo RNAi
technologies. Through this approach we were able to
identify the epigenetic ‘reader’ Bromodomain-containing
4 Protein (BRD4) as a new potential target in AML [33].
Inhibition of BRD4 using BRD4-specific RNAi or JQ1, a
BET bromodomain inhibitor that blocks BRD4-binding to
acetylated histones, showed profound antileukemic effects
in AML mouse models as well as in various human AML
cell lines and in primary leukemic cells obtained from
AML patients [33].
In the present study, we extended these analyses to
various subtypes of AML as well as to AML LSC. The
specific aim of our study was to evaluate BRD4-inhibition
as a potential therapeutic approach to target and eliminate
LSC in AML. To address this question, we analyzed the
effects of JQ1 on primary neoplastic stem- and progenitor
cells obtained from patients with freshly diagnosed or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

refractory AML. In addition, we asked whether JQ1 would
synergize with conventional cytostatic drugs to produce
synergistic anti-leukemic effects in AML.

RESULTS
BRD4 is expressed in AML cells including CD34+
stem- and progenitor cells
As assessed by qPCR analysis, BRD4 mRNA was
found to be expressed in highly enriched sorted CD34+/
CD38+ AML progenitor cells and CD34+/CD38− stem cells
(Figure 1A). In addition, all AML cell lines examined
(HL60, U937, KG1, MV4-11, MOLM-13) were found
to express BRD4 mRNA (not shown). Expression of
the BRD4 protein in AML cells was examined by ICC
and IHC. As assessed by ICC, BRD4 was found to be
expressed in primary AML cells (blasts) in all donors
without negative subpopulations (Figure 1B). More
importantly, we found that in all donors examined, the
CD34+/CD38+ and the CD34+/CD38− stem- and progenitor
cells express the BRD4 antigen without negative
subpopulations (Figure 1B). No differences in BRD4
expression were seen when comparing different FAB or
WHO subtypes of AML. In addition, all AML cell lines
tested were found to stain positive for BRD4 (Figure 1C).
BRD4 was found to be expressed in both the cytoplasmic
compartment and nuclear compartment of leukemic cells
in all patients and all cell lines tested (Figure 1B and 1C),
and the same was found when normal BM cells or cord
blood cells were analyzed (not shown). Preincubation of
the anti-BRD4 antibody with a specific blocking peptide
resulted in a negative stain (Figure 1C). Corresponding
results were obtained by IHC. Again, BRD4 was found to
be expressed in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment
of leukemic cells in all donors and all AML variants tested
(Figure 1D). In the normal BM, BRD4 was also expressed
in myeloid progenitor cells as well as in megakaryocytes.
However, compared to the leukemic marrow, BRD4
expression appeared to be more restricted to the nuclear
compartment of myeloid cells. Table 1 shows the
distribution of BRD4 in the various cellular compartments
in AML and in control BM sections. Together, our data
show that BRD4 is expressed in both the cytoplasm and in
the nuclei of AML blasts and AML LSC.

The BRD4-targeting drug JQ1 inhibits
proliferation of leukemic cells in freshly diagnosed
and relapsed or refractory AML
Confirming our previous data [33] the BET
bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 was found to block
3
H-thymidine uptake and thus proliferation in

JQ1 induces apoptosis in primary AML cells

unfractionated primary AML blasts. In particular, JQ1 was
found to inhibit the proliferation of leukemic cells in 27/28
AML patients tested, with reasonable IC50 values (<1 µM)
(Table 2). Anti-leukemic effects of JQ1 were seen in all
patients with primary, untreated AML (n=18), and in 9/10
patients (90%) with relapsed or refractory AML (Table 2).
In the responding patients, IC50 values ranged between 20
and 450 nM (median: 100 nM) without major differences
when comparing freshly diagnosed AML patients with
relapsed or refractory AML (Table 2, Figure 2A). In
normal BM samples (n=3), JQ1 also produced growth
inhibition, but the IC50 values were higher compared to
that found in AML cells (IC50: 100-500 nM, median: 250
nM).

In a next step, we examined the mechanism(s) of
JQ1-induced growth inhibition in AML cells. In these
experiments, JQ1 was found to induce apoptosis in
primary AML cells in all samples tested, including cells
derived from freshly diagnosed or relapsed patients.
Induction of apoptosis was measured by light microscopy
(Figure 3A) as well as by caspase 3 staining and flow
cytometry (Figure 3B). JQ1 also produced apoptosis in all
AML cell lines tested confirming our previous data (not
shown) [33].

inhibitory effects on AML cells. For these experiments, the
AML cell lines HL60 and KG1 were employed. As visible
in Figure 4, JQ1 was found to exert strong synergistic
antileukemic effects when combined with ARA-C in
both cell lines (Figure 4). These data suggest that drug
combinations employing conventional cytostatic drugs,
like ARA-C and a BET bromodomain inhibitor, may
produce synergistic antileukemic effects in AML cells.

In a next step, we examined the effects of JQ1 on
survival of leukemic stem- and progenitor cells derived
from our AML patients. As shown in Figure 3C, JQ1
induced apoptosis in CD34+/CD38+ as well as CD34+/
CD38− stem and progenitor cells in all samples and
all donors tested, including patients with relapsed or
refractory AML, and without major differences when
comparing FAB or WHO subtypes.

DISCUSSION
Based on their self-renewal and disease-propagating
capacity, leukemic stem- and progenitor cells represent
an attractive therapeutic target in AML [26-32]. Notably,
AML LSC are considered a relevant source of relapsing
disease and exhibit intrinsic as well as acquired resistance
[28-32]. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made
to understand the mechanisms of LSC resistance, and to
identify new drug targets that play an important role in
survival, self renewal, and proliferation of AML LSC.
However, so far, little is known about the expression
of molecular targets in AML LSC and about effects of
various targeted drugs [25-28]. We have recently shown
that the epigenetic reader BRD4 is a novel promising
target in AML [33]. In the present study, we have extended
these analyses and show that AML LSC express BRD4,
and that the BRD4-targeting drug JQ1 induces growth
inhibition and apoptosis in these cells, which may have

JQ1 synergizes with ARA-C in producing growth
inhibition in AML cells
Since JQ1 and other (similar) BET bromodomain
inhibitors are considered to be used in clinical trials in
AML patients in combination with conventional cytostatic
drugs like ARA-C, we asked whether JQ1 and ARA-C
would produce cooperative or even synergistic growth-

clinical implications. In addition, our data are the first
to show that a drug combination consisting of a BET
bromodomain inhibitor and ARA-C, can produce strong
synergistic growth-inhibitory effects in AML cells.
Expression of BRD4 in AML stem- and progenitor
cells was demonstrable by qPCR and by immunostaining.
Both the CD34+/CD38- and the CD34+/CD38+ stemand progenitor cells contained BRD4 mRNA as well as
the BRD4 protein in all categories of AML, including
refractory or relapsing disease. In addition, all AML
cell lines examined were found to express BRD4. An
interesting observation was that normal CD34+ stem
cells also expressed BRD4, with similar expression
levels compared to LSC. In addition, myeloid progenitor
cells and even mature granulocytic cells were found to
express BRD4 in the normal BM. These data suggest that
targeting of BRD4 may result in a decreased production
of normal BM cells. Indeed, we were able to show that

JQ1 inhibits the growth of normal BM cells in vitro.
However, the concentrations required to fully block
growth of normal BM cells were higher as that required
to block proliferation of AML blasts. This difference may
well provide a “pharmacological window” sufficient to
introduce JQ1 or similar BET bromodomain inhibitors
in clinical trials. In line with this assumption, JQ1 was not
found to act as a myelosuppressive agent when applied in
vivo in various mouse models [33].
BRD4 is a well known transcriptional regulator
and chromatin modifier that plays a key role in cell cycle
progression in normal and neoplastic cells [34-36]. More
recent data suggest, that BRD4 exhibits atypical kinase
activity and interacts with a number of nuclear and
cytoplasmic interaction-partners such as SPA-1 [37,38].
In the present study, we were able to show that BRD4 is
expressed in the cytoplasm and in nuclei of AML blasts
and CD34+CD38- AML LSC. The prominent cytoplasmic
location of BRD4 was somehow unexpected and suggests
that BRD4 may fulfil as yet unknown biological functions
in the cytoplasmic compartment of AML cells. An
interesting observation was that BRD4 is also expressed
in the cytoplasm and nuclei of normal bone marrow cells
and highly enriched cord blood progenitor cells, although
the expression levels were lower compared to AML cells.
However, even in terminally differentiated non-dividing
BM cells, BRD4 was found to be expressed in the
cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment. These observations
suggest that BRD4 may fulfil important functions in
normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis, including immature
myeloid stem- and progenitor cells and both the nuclear
and cytoplamic compartment of these cells.
We have recently shown that the BRD4-blocking
drug JQ1 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in
human and murine AML cells [33]. In the present study,
we have extended these investigations and asked whether
JQ1 would also block the growth and survival of leukemic
cells in patients with relapsed or resistant AML. Indeed,
our results show that JQ1 induces growth inhibition and
apoptosis with reasonable IC50 values in primary AML
cells in almost all patients examined, including patients
with relapsed or resistant disease. This observation is of
particular interest and may have clinical implications.
In fact, these patients have a very poor prognosis, and
novel drugs will be required to improve therapy. Whether
indeed BRD4-targeting agents will be successful in the
treatment of AML remains at present unknown. Based
on our promising preclinical results, we recommend that
BET bromodomain inhibitors should be evaluated for their
efficacy in AML in forthcoming clinical trials.
As mentioned above, LSC are a major operational
target of drug therapy [26-32,39]. In order to learn
whether JQ1 would act anti-leukemic at the LSC level,
we analyzed responses of CD34+CD38- cells and CD34+/
CD38+ cells to JQ1. In these experiments, JQ1 was found
to induce apoptosis of CD34+CD38- and CD34+/CD38+

Figure 4: Synergistic growth-inhibitory effects of JQ1
and ARA-C on growth of AML cells. HL60 cells (upper
panel) and KG1 cells (lower panel) were incubated in control
medium or in medium containing various concentrations of
JQ1, various concentrations of cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C),
or a combination of both drugs at various concentrations at a
fixed drug-ratio (20:1 for HL60 cells and 10:1 for KG1). Drugs
were applied at 37°C for 48 hours. After incubation, uptake of
3
H-thymidine was measured. Results are expressed as percent
of medium control. Result of one typical experiment are shown.

Cell lines

stem- and progenitor cells in all patients examined,
including patients with relapsing or resistant AML. These
data suggest that JQ1 may be capable of eradicating
LSC, an assumption that needs to be confirmed in further
preclinical and clinical studies.
Many of the novel anti-leukemic drugs used to treat
refractory AML are applied in combination with other antiAML agents [40-42]. Therefore, it was of considerable
interest to learn whether JQ1 would cooperate or even
synergize with established chemotherapeutics when
applied on AML cells. In the present study, we were able
to show that JQ1 and ARA-C produce clear synergistic
effects when used in combination to treat AML cells. This
observation is of clinical importance and would be in favor
of novel treatment concepts combining JQ1 or similar
BRD4 inhibitors and ARA-C in patients with relapsing or
refractory AML in clinical trials.
In conclusion, we have identified BRD4 as a novel
drug target expressed in AML cells including AML LSC,
and that JQ1 is an effective agent capable of blocking
growth of AML cells and LSC through BRD4 inhibition.
These observations may have clinical implications, as
BRD4 blockers like JQ1 and similar agents may soon be
applied in clinical trials to treat AML. Whether these drugs
will improve therapy in relapsed or resistant AML remains
to be determined.

AML cell lines used in this study were HL60,
U937, KG1, MV4-11, and MOLM-13 (all from the
German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures,
Braunschweig, Germany). Cell lines were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS; PAA laboratories, Pasching, Austria) at 5%
CO2 and 37°C.

Immunocytochemistry (ICC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)
To confirm expression of BRD4 in leukemic cells,
ICC and IHC were performed according to published
protocols [46-48]. ICC was performed on AML cell lines
(U937, HL-60, KG-1, MV4-11, MOLM-13), primary
AML MNC, and sorted CD34+/CD38- AML LSC.
Cells were spun on cytospin slides and incubated with
a polyclonal rabbit anti-human BRD4 antibody (SigmaAldrich, St.Louis, MO; work dilution 1:100) for 20 hours.
Cells were then washed and incubated with biotinylated
goat-anti-rabbit IgG for 30 minutes. As chromogen,
alkaline phosphatase complex (Biocare, Walnut Creek,
CA) was used. Antibody-reactivity was made visible
by Neofuchsin (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). In control
experiments, the anti-BRD4 antibody was preincubated
with control buffer or a BRD4-specific blocking peptide
(Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) for 1 hour before
ICC or IHC were carried out.
IHC was performed on sections prepared from
paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed BM biopsy specimens
(AML, n=13; normal/reactive BM: n=6) using the indirect
immunoperoxidase staining technique as reported [46-48].
Prior to staining, sections were pretreated by microwave
oven. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by methanol/
H2O2. Slides were incubated with anti-BRD4 antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich, work dilution: 1:50; pH 7.5) at 4°C for
20 hours. Then, slides were washed and incubated with
biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA)
for 30 minutes, washed, and then exposed to Vectastain
ABC KIT for 30 minutes. 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole
(AEC, Sigma) was used as chromogen. All slides were
counterstained in Mayer´s Hemalaun.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients and isolation of AML cells
A total number of 37 patients with AML (females,
n=16; males, n=21) were examined. The median age was
59 years (range: 21-85 years). Diagnoses were established
according to the proposal of the French-AmericanBritish (FAB) cooperative study group [43,44] and the
classification of the World Health organization (WHO)
[45]. Of the 37 patients, 23 had freshly diagnosed AML,
and 14 suffered from refractory or relapsed AML. The
patients´ characteristics are shown in Table 3. For control
purpose we examined bone marrow (BM) cells obtained
from one patient with Non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma without
BM involvement, one with idiopathic cytopenia, and one
with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in major molecular
remission. Informed consent was obtained prior to BM
puncture in each case. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board (Ethics Committee) of the
Medical University of Vienna. Mononuclear cells (MNC)
were prepared using Ficoll and stored in liquid nitrogen
until used or were used as freshly prepared MNC. After
thawing, the viability of AML cells ranged from 75% to
99% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion.

then harvested on filter membranes in a Filtermate 196
harvester (Packard Bioscience, Meriden, CT). Filters
were air-dried, and the bound radioactivity was measured
in a ß-counter (Top-Count NXT, Packard Bioscience). All
experiments were performed in triplicates. Proliferation
was calculated as percent of medium control, and the
inhibitory effects of JQ1 were expressed as IC50 values.
In a separate set of experiments, AML cell lines (KG-1,
HL60) were incubated in various concentrations of JQ1,
various concentrations of ARA-C, or a combination of
both drugs at fixed ratio of drug-concentrations.

PCR experiments were performed on RNA from
AML cell lines, unfractionated AML cells, sorted CD34+/
CD38+ and CD34+/CD38− AML cells (n=9) and sorted
cord blood CD34+/CD38+ and CD34+/CD34− cells pooled
from 3 donors. RNA was isolated using RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). mRNA levels were
quantified on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System
from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), using
iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX from Bio-Rad
(Hercules, CA). ABL was employed as a reference gene.

Flow cytometric evaluation of apoptosis in AML
cells
Primary AML cells (n=9) were incubated in RPMI
1640 medium and 10% FCS in the absence or presence
of various concentrations of JQ1 (10-5,000 nM) at 37°C
(5% CO2) for 48 hours. Thereafter, cells were subjected
to flow cytometry experiments following published
protocols [48-51]. Apoptosis was measured by combined
Annexin-V/propidium-iodide staining and caspasestaining. Before being stained with rabbit anti-human
monoclonal antibody (mAb) C92-605 (Becton Dickinson
Biosciences) directed against active caspase 3, cells were
fixed in paraformaldehyde (2%) and permeabilized in
methanol at -20°C (15 minutes). Then, cells were washed
and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson
Biosciences). Apoptosis was expressed as percentage of
active caspase 3-positive cells.
To study apoptosis in stem- and progenitor cells,
CD45+/CD34+/CD38+ BM progenitor cells and CD45+/
CD34+/CD38− BM stem cells were examined for apoptosis
by combined staining for surface antigens, 4´,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
Annexin-V-FITC (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) as
described [51]. Apoptosis was expressed as percent of
Annexin-V+ cells after gating for DAPI-negative cells
(early apoptotic cells). The mAb used to identify stemand progenitor cells were phycoerythrin-labeled CD34
mAb 581, the allophycocyanin-labeled CD38 mAb HIT2,
and the peridinin chlorophyll protein-labeled CD45 mAb
2D1 (all from BD Biosciences, San José, CA).

Statistical analysis
Differences in growth and apoptosis in drugexposed cells were determined by appropriate statistical
analysis, including the paired student´s t test. Results were
considered to be significantly different when the p value
was <0.05.
