Abstract
Immune tolerance to tumor-associated self-antigens poses a major challenge in the ability to mount an
effective cancer vaccine response. To overcome immune tolerance to HER-2, we formulated DNA vaccines
that express both human HER-2 and heterologous rat Neu sequences in separate plasmids or as single hybrid
constructs that encode HER-2/Neu fusion proteins. Candidate vaccines were tested in Her-2 transgenic (Tg)
mice of BALB/c (BALB), BALB/c × C57BL/6 F1 (F1), or C57BL/6 (B6) background, which exhibit decreasing
immune responsiveness to HER-2. Analysis of various cocktails or hybrid vaccines defined a requirement for
particular combination of HER/2/Neu sequences to effectively prime immune effector cells in HER-2 Tg mice.
In B6 HER-2 Tg mice, rejection of HER-2–positive tumors protected mice from HER-2–negative tumors, providing evidence of epitope spreading. Our findings show that a strategy of combining heterologous antigen
with self-antigens could produce a potent DNA vaccine that may be applicable to other tumor-associated
antigens. Cancer Res; 70(1); 119–28. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Dysregulated signal transduction from overexpressed or
mutated ErbB-2 (Her-2/neu) leads to cellular immortalization, neoplastic transformation, and tumor progression (1,
2). Consequently, Her-2 is a negative prognostic factor in
breast cancer (3–6). Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as
trastuzumab (Herceptin) and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib are effective against Her-2–positive
breast cancers (7–9), but patients typically develop resistance
after treatment, suggesting compensatory activity through alternative signaling pathways (10–13).
Her-2 DNA vaccines have shown promising activities in
human Her-2 or rat neu transgenic (Tg) mice, but immune
tolerance to tumor-associated self-antigens continues to be
a major challenge (14, 15). In several experimental autoimmune disease models, tolerance to self-antigens is overcome
by immunization with heterologous (xenogeneic) antigens,
e.g., murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
is induced by bovine or guinea pig myelin basic protein

(16, 17), collagen-induced arthritis by bovine, porcine, or
human collagen (18), and autoimmune myasthenia gravis
by Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor (19, 20). These
heterologous antigens may share common or cross-reactive
epitopes with self-antigens to overcome immune tolerance
and trigger self-reactive T cells. Importantly, human or
mouse tyrosinase DNA prolongs the survival of dogs with
malignant melanoma (21), resulting in the licensing of a
DNA vaccine for canine melanoma (21, 22).
To test if heterologous antigens could be exploited to improve Her-2 vaccine efficacy, BALB NeuT mice expressing a
rat neu transgene were electrovaccinated with human Her-2
or self neu DNA (23). Greater T-cell response to neu was induced by heterologous Her-2 than by self neu. But only self
neu, not heterologous Her-2 vaccine, induced the anti-neu
antibodies that were critical in delaying spontaneous tumor
formation. These results reflect the exquisite specificity of
anti-neu antibodies and that humoral immunity is the primary effector mechanism against neu-induced spontaneous
tumors. Not all Her-2–positive breast cancers are sensitive to
antibody-mediated destruction (24). We have shown that TUBO
and Bam1a cells, established from BALB NeuT spontaneous
mammary tumors, were highly sensitive to anti-neu mAb or
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. On the other hand, receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor–resistant BamIR-5 or neu-transfected
D2F2/neu cell lines were refractory to antibody therapy. Nevertheless, all test cells could be controlled by CTL, demonstrating
the importance of inducing both T-cell and B-cell responses
with Her-2 vaccines (24). In this study, we tested the hypothesis
that cocktail or hybrid vaccines containing both self human
Her-2 and heterologous rat neu DNA sequences would induce
greater antitumor immunity than either single antigen.
We have shown that human Her-2 Tg mice on a BALB/c
background were much more responsive to Her-2 vaccination

than those on a C57BL/6 background (15). Therefore, the
candidate vaccines were tested in Her-2 Tg mice of BALB/c,
C57BL/6, or (BALB/c × C57BL/6) F1 background to represent
patients with heterogeneous genetic makeup.

Materials and Methods
Mice. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with accredited institution guidelines and the U.S.
Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. C57BL/6 (B6) and BALB/c (BALB) female mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratory.
Heterozygous C57BL/6 Her-2 Tg mice (B6 Her-2 Tg), which
expressed the full-length, wild-type human Her-2 under the
whey acidic protein promoter were generated in our laboratory and have been maintained by mating with wild-type B6
mice (25). BALB/c Her-2 Tg (BALB Her-2 Tg) mice were generated by back-crossing B6 Her-2 Tg mice with wild-type
BALB/c mice (15). (BALB × B6) F1 Her-2 Tg mice (F1 Her2 Tg) were generated by crossing BALB Her-2 Tg mice with
wild-type B6 mice or vice versa. Transgene-positive mice
were identified by PCR as we previously described (25).
DNA vaccine constructs. pVax/E2TM (pE2TM) and pcDNA/
NeuTM (pNeuTM) encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human (Her-2) or rat (neu) erbB-2, respectively, have been previously described (23). pEFBos/granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (pGM-CSF) encoding
murine GM-CSF was provided by Dr. N. Nishisaki at Osaka
University, Osaka, Japan. The blank vector, pVax1 (Invitrogen),
was the control.
Hybrid DNA vaccines pE2-NeuTM (alternatively designated
as HuRT in EP08004513.1 and manuscript submitted by
Quaglino and colleagues), pNeuE2TM (alternatively designated
as RHuT in USP20070299023 and manuscript submitted by
Quaglino and colleagues), and pE2-Neu500TM were generated
(Fig. 1A), using strategies described in Supplementary Fig. S1.
Characterization of DNA constructs. DNA constructs
were transiently transfected into 3T3 cells using LipofectAMINE
2000 (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The mAb TA-1 (Ab5; Calbiochem), N12, N29 (both hybridomas provided by Dr. Yosef Yarden, Weissman Institute;
refs. 26, 27), and trastuzumab (Genentech; ref. 28) were used
to characterize Her-2 epitopes in the chimera fusion protein
and 7.16.4 (Ab4, Calbiochem) for the neu epitope (29). Polyclonal Her-2 and neu immune sera were used as positive
controls. PE-goat anti-mouse IgG or PE-mouse anti-human
IgG was the secondary antibody. Samples were analyzed on
a BD FACScalibur or FACScanto II and with FlowJo software
(TreeStar).
Cell lines. The BALB/c mouse mammary tumor line D2F2
was established in our group from a spontaneous tumor that
arose from the prolactin-induced hyperplastic alveolar nodule line, D2, as previously described (30). D2F2/E2 was generated by stable transfection of D2F2 cells with wild-type
human Her-2 (23, 31). Their mouse origin was verified by
spectral karyotyping in 2008 (24). E0771/E2 provided by
Dr. Daniel Allendorf in 2005 (James Graham Brown Cancer
Center, Louisville, KY) was generated by transfecting the

120

Cancer Res; 70(1) January 1, 2010

C57BL/6 mammary tumor E0771 with wild-type Her-2 (15).
E0771 and E0771/E2 developed into palpable tumors in mice
of C57BL/6 origin. BALB/c antigen-presenting cells 3T3/KB
expressed H2Kd and B7.1 (CD80), and 3T3/EKB or 3T3/
NKB expressed additional Her-2 or neu (23, 32). C57BL/6
TC-1 cells (Dr. T.C. Wu, The Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, MD) expressed endogenous H2Kb and B7.1 (15).
TC-1/E2 was transfected to express wild-type Her-2 as antigen-presenting cells. SKOV3, a human ovarian cancer cell
line with amplified Her-2 (33), was purchased from American
Type Culture Collection and Her-2 expression was verified
regularly by flow cytometry. The hybridoma line PC61 (American Type Culture Collection), which produces rat mAb to
mouse CD25 was propagated in severe combined immunodeficient mice. All cell lines were maintained as previously
described (34).
Immunization. Mice received DNA electrovaccination as
we previously described (34). Wild-type mice were immunized twice whereas Her-2 Tg mice were immunized four
times. To deplete CD25hi regulatory T cells (Treg), indicated
groups of mice received 0.5 mg of CD25 mAb, PC61, i.p. 7 d
prior to the first electrovaccination. Depletion of CD25hi
T-cells was verified by flow cytometry.
Measurement of Her-2 or neu binding antibodies by flow
cytometry. Anti–Her-2 antibodies were measured by binding
to Her-2 overexpressing SKOV3 cells using flow cytometry,
and antibody concentrations were calculated by regression
analysis using mAb TA-1 as the standard (35). Normal mouse
serum or isotype-matched mAb was the negative control. Antineu antibody was measured with 3T3/NKB cells (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and the standard curve was generated using
mAb 7.16.4 (Ab4). Differences in antibody concentration were
analyzed by Student's t test. IgG isotypes were measured with
FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and expressed as mean channel fluorescence.
Measurement of T-cell response by IFN-γ ELISPOT. All
ELISPOT reagents were purchased from BD Biosciences,
unless otherwise specified. Her-2–reactive T cells were enumerated by IFN-γ ELISPOT assay as we described (15, 23).
Peripheral blood (PBL) or spleen cells were incubated for
48 h with the antigen-presenting cells TC-1, TC-1/E2,
3T3/KB, or 3T3/EKB at an antigen-presenting cell/lymphocyte ratio of 1:10. The results were expressed as the number
of cytokine-producing cells per 10 6 PBL or spleen cells.
Neu-reactive T cells were monitored using 3T3/NKB cells as
antigen-presenting cells. Data were analyzed using Student's
t test.
Tumor growth inhibition assay. To measure protective
immunity, Her-2 Tg mice were inoculated s.c. in the flank
with 2 × 105 D2F2/E2 or E0771/E2 tumor cells 2 wk after
the fourth electrovaccination. Tumor growth was monitored
weekly, and tumor volume was calculated by XY2 / 2 (X =
long axis, Y = short axis). To test therapeutic potential, mice
were inoculated with 2 × 105 D2F2/E2 or E0771/E2 tumor
cells 11 d after a single vaccination. B6 Her-2 Tg mice were
depleted of Treg using 0.5 mg of PC61 7 d prior to the first
electrovaccination. Starting 3 d following tumor inoculation,
mice received three weekly vaccinations. Tumor growth was

monitored by weekly palpation and difference in tumor incidence was analyzed by the log rank test.

Results
Induction of Her-2 immunity with self versus
heterologous DNA vaccine
To compare the activity of self versus heterologous vaccines, BALB NeuT or BALB Her-2 Tg mice were electrovaccinated four times, every 2 weeks, with 50 μg of pE2TM or
pNeuTM. In all vaccination experiments, equal amounts of
pGM-CSF were coadministered. Antibody response was
measured 2 weeks after the final vaccination. As shown in

Table 1, pNeuTM induced higher levels of neu binding antibodies when administered as a foreign antigen in Her-2 Tg mice
(54 ± 5 μg/mL) rather than as a self-antigen in NeuT Tg mice
(16 ± 2 μg/mL), but neither antiserum recognized Her-2,
showing antigen specificity. Similarly, pE2TM induced more
Her-2–binding antibodies in NeuT (40 ± 3 μg/mL) than in
Her-2 Tg (20 ± 5 μg/mL) mice, again neither serum recognized neu. Therefore, antibodies induced by DNA vaccines
showed exquisite specificity to the cognate antigen.
In the T-cell compartment, however, heterologous antigen
was more effective in activating self-reactive T cells. In NeuT
mice, self pNeuTM induced 294 ± 50 spots/106 spleen cells
of neu-specific, IFN-γ–producing T cells, but heterologous
pE2TM activated more anti-neu T cells at 567 ± 176 (P <

pVax1 and pGM-CSF. Sera were collected after each vaccination and Her-2–specific antibodies of individual mice were measured by flow cytometry.
C, Her-2–responsive IFN-γ–secreting T cells in pooled PBL were measured by ELISPOT assay after the second and fourth vaccinations. PBL were
incubated with 3T3/EKB for 48 h before the assay and 3T3/KB cells were used as controls. D, at 2 wk following the fourth vaccination, all mice were
challenged s.c. with 2 × 105 D2F2/E2, and tumors were palpated weekly. There were 7 to 10 mice per group (*, P < 0.05).

0.001). Similarly, in Her-2 Tg mice, heterologous pNeuTM induced 292 ± 16 anti–Her-2 T cells, significantly more than that
by self pE2TM (124 ± 4, P < 0.001). Therefore, heterologous Her2 or neu DNA is superior in overcoming T-cell tolerance. All
ELISPOT assays were performed with pooled PBL except in
NeuT mice whose splenocytes were used because neu-reactive T cells were not detectable in their PBL.
Induction of Her-2 immunity with a cocktail vaccine of
pE2TM and pNeuTM
The disparate cellular and humoral immunity induced by
heterologous and self-antigens led to the hypothesis that
antitumor immunity may be enhanced by combined vaccination with rat neu and human Her-2. To test this hypothesis,
BALB Her-2 Tg mice were immunized four times with a
cocktail of 25 μg of pE2TM and 25 μg of pNeuTM (Fig. 1). Control groups received 50 μg of either pNeuTM or pE2TM. The
cocktail vaccine induced 74 ± 9 μg/mL of Her-2 binding antibodies at week 8, compared with 23 ± 17 μg/mL by pE2TM
alone, showing significant amplification of humoral response
by the presence of heterologous neu in the vaccine (Fig. 1B).
In the T-cell compartment, pE2TM activated more T cells
than heterologous pNeuTM after two vaccinations (Fig. 1C).
After four vaccinations, T-cell response in pNeuTM immunized mice escalated to reach 292 ± 16/106 PBL, whereas
the pE2TM immunized mice produced 116 ± 21/106 PBL. Surprisingly, T-cell response in the cocktail vaccine group was
only comparable to that in pE2TM group, below that induced
by the heterologous pNeuTM. Because pNeuTM itself did not
induce Her-2–binding antibodies (Table 1; ref. 23) and Her-2–
specific T-cell response was not elevated by the cocktail vaccine (Fig. 1C), the enhanced Her-2 antibody response could
be due to immune stimulation by the foreign epitopes in neu.
All test and control mice were challenged s.c. with D2F2/
E2 tumor cells (Fig. 1D), which were rejected in 72% (five of
seven) of mice receiving the pE2TM + pNeuTM cocktail, compared with 38% (three of eight) in the pE2TM group (P < 0.05)
and 60% (6 of 10) in the pNeuTM group. The elevated levels of
Her-2 antibodies induced by the cocktail vaccine might mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity to exert
greater inhibition of tumor growth even though D2F2/E2 tumor cells are insensitive to the direct inhibitory effects of

122

Cancer Res; 70(1) January 1, 2010

Her-2 antibodies (24). Importantly, pNeuTM, which induced
strong T-cell response without anti–Her-2 antibody, showed
comparable antitumor activity to the cocktail vaccine.2
Generation and characterization of hybrid Her-2-neu
vaccines
Because antibody-sensitive and -resistant cells both exist
in human breast cancer, the efficacy of combining Her-2
and neu into one vaccine formulation was further tested with
hybrid vaccines that encode fusion proteins of Her-2 and neu
(Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1). The chimeric E2-NeuTM protein is a transmembrane Her-2-neu fusion protein with a
truncated ICD. Neu-E2TM is the reverse product with neu
at the NH2 terminus and Her-2 at the COOH terminus (36).
The third chimeric vaccine pE2-Neu500TM was modified from
pE2-NeuTM to restore Her-2 amino acids 501 to 687 which
encompassed the epitope(s) recognized by trastuzumab
(28). The fusion protein generated from each test construct
was verified after transient transfection into 3T3 cells, using
a panel of Her-2 and neu mAbs as well as polyclonal antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Immunogenicity of the hybrid vaccines was verified in wildtype BALB/c females. Comparable levels of Her-2 antibodies
(∼40 μg/mL) were induced by pE2TM, pE2-NeuTM, and pE2Neu500TM (Supplementary Fig. S2A), each containing Her-2
NH2-terminal codons. pNeu-E2TM containing NH2-terminal
neu induced less Her-2 binding antibodies at 18 ± 4 μg/mL.
pNeuTM did not induce Her-2 binding antibodies as predicted
(Table 1). Conversely, ∼70 μg/mL of neu-binding antibodies
were induced by pNeuTM or pNeu-E2TM, which contained neu
in the NH2 terminus (Supplementary Fig. S2A) with low-level
activity from pE2-NeuTM or pE2-Neu500TM (11 ± 3 and 6.3 ±
3 μg/mL, respectively). Therefore, in wild-type mice, fusion
proteins which contained Her-2 or neu in the NH2 terminus
induced greater antibody response to the respective antigen.
Regarding T cells, high levels of Her-2–specific IFN-γ–
secreting cells were induced by pE2TM or pE2-NeuTM and
modestly by pNeuTM or pNeu-E2TM (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Neu-specific T-cell response was comparable in mice vaccinated with pNeuTM, pNeu-E2TM, or pE2TM, with somewhat
weaker response from pE2-NeuTM. Bearing some variation,
hybrid vaccines were immunogenic in wild-type mice,

with the NH2 terminus sequences of Her-2 showing greater
immunogenicity.
Activity of hybrid vaccines in Her-2 Tg mice
BALB Her-2 Tg mice. The immunogenicity and efficacy of
hybrid vaccines were tested in BALB Her-2 Tg mice using
pE2-NeuTM or the reverse pNeu-E2TM. pE2TM was the control.
pE2-NeuTM induced significantly higher levels of Her-2 antibodies, compared with pE2TM or pNeu-E2TM, more prominently after the third vaccination (Fig. 2A), consistent with
greater immunogenicity of epitopes in Her-2 NH2 terminus.
Immunoglobulin isotype analysis showed the induction of
both IgG1 and IgG2a (Fig. 2A, right).
Her-2–reactive T cells in pooled PBL were measured after
two and four vaccinations (Fig. 2B). After two vaccinations,
pE2TM induced more IFN-γ–secreting T cells than either hybrid constructs. After four vaccinations with pE2-NeuTM,
however, hybrid pE2-Neu TM showed a modest edge over
pE2 TM (153 ± 4/10 6 compared with 116 ± 21/10 6 ) and
pNeu-E2TM (92 ± 4/106), suggesting the advantage of concurrent presentation of neu and preservation of Her-2 NH2 terminus in the vaccine regimen.
When mice were challenged subcutaneously with D2F2/
E2 cells, 80% (8 of 10) of pE2-NeuTM–vaccinated mice were

protected, but only 40% of pE2TM-vaccinated mice (2 of 5)
and 33% (3 of 9) of pNeu-E2TM–vaccinated mice were protected (Fig. 2C). Thus, enhanced Her-2 antibody and T-cell
response was induced after four vaccinations with hybrid
pE2-NeuTM to result in elevated antitumor activity.
(BALB × B6) F1 Her-2 Tg mice
We previously reported that BALB Her-2 Tg mice were
much more responsive to pE2TM than B6 Her-2 Tg mice,
and that (BALB × B6) F1 Her-2 Tg mice produced intermediate response (15, 25). To further test the efficacy of
hybrid vaccines, F1 Her-2 Tg mice which showed intermediate Her-2 reactivity were immunized with pE2TM, pE2NeuTM, or pE2-Neu500TM, the latter was constructed to
restore Her-2 amino acids 501 to 650, thus reintroducing
the epitopes recognized by trastuzumab and reducing the
neu sequence from 263 amino acids to 110 amino acids.
In some test mice, Treg were depleted with CD25 mAb 1
week before vaccination (Fig. 3A; ref. 15).
In mice with intact Tregs, Her-2 antibodies induced by
pE2-Neu TM more than doubled that by pE2 TM or pE2Neu500TM (Fig. 3B, left). After Treg depletion, antibody response increased most significantly in the pE2-Neu 500TM
group to approach that by pE2-NeuTM (Fig. 3B, right). These

pooled PBL were measured after the second and fourth vaccination. C, at 2 wk following the last vaccination, mice were challenged with 2 × 105 D2F2/E2
and tumor growth was monitored by weekly palpation. There were 4 to 10 mice per group (*, P < 0.001).

results suggested that Her-2 extracellular domain residues
500 to 687 may activate Treg and their presence in pE2Neu500TM might compromise vaccine activity.
After four vaccinations, pE2-NeuTM induced significantly
more IFN-γ–producing T cells than pE2TM or pE2-Neu500TM
(Fig. 3C, left), consistent with Treg activation by pE2Neu500TM. Furthermore, the shorter 110 residues of heterologous neu in pE2-Neu500TM may be insufficient to overcome

group increased; still, pE2-NeuTM induced more than twice
the number of IFN-γ–producing T cells (397 ± 30) than
pE2TM (147 ± 15). T-cell response to pE2-Neu500TM improved,
but did not approach pE2-NeuTM, indicating the need for additional neu residues for Her-2 T-cell activation (Fig. 3C).
To measure antitumor immunity, the experiment was repeated with an increased number of mice. Treg-depleted F1

Improved Her-2 DNA Vaccines Contain Heterologous Neu Codons

Her-2 Tg mice were vaccinated four times with pE2-NeuTM,
pE2TM, or control pVax1 before they were inoculated s.c. with
Her-2–transfected D2F2/E2 cells of BALB/c origin or E0771/
E2 cells of C57BL/6 origin. There were six to seven mice in
each group. All tumors grew progressively in pVax1 control
mice (Fig. 3D). pE2TM vaccination protected six of seven mice
from D2F2/E2 and five of seven mice from E0771/E2. In the
pE2-NeuTM–vaccinated group, all mice rejected the challenging tumor, either D2F2/E2 or E0771/E2. Therefore, the hybrid
pE2-NeuTM induced stronger humoral and cellular immunity
than pE2TM in F1 Her-2 Tg mice to provide complete protection from tumors of either parental background.
B6 Her-2 Tg mice
pE2-NeuTM was further tested in B6 Her-2 Tg mice which
were poorly responsive to pE2TM vaccination (15, 23). Treg
were depleted with CD25 mAb 1 week before mice were vaccinated with pE2-NeuTM or control pE2TM.
After a single vaccination, pE2-NeuTM already induced significantly more Her-2–binding antibodies than pE2TM. After
four vaccinations, pE2-NeuTM induced 64 ± 4 μg/mL of Her-2
antibodies and pE2TM induced 20 ± 9 μg/mL (Fig. 4A). In
T-cell response, pE2 TM induced 13 ± 2 IFN-γ–secreting
cells/106 PBL, whereas the pE2-NeuTM hybrid induced 49 ±
4 cells (Fig. 4B). At 2 weeks after the final vaccination, mice
were challenged with 2 × 105 E0771/E2 cells. In 40% (two of

five) of pE2TM-vaccinated mice and 100% (five of five) of pE2NeuTM–vaccinated mice, the tumors were rejected, further
supporting greater efficacy of the hybrid vaccine (Fig. 4C,
left). To determine whether rejection of E0771/E2 resulted
in immune priming to other tumor-associated antigens,
pE2-NeuTM–vaccinated mice which rejected the primary tumors were re-challenged 7 weeks later with parental E0771
which did not express Her-2 and 80% (four of five) of these
mice rejected the second tumor challenge (Fig. 4C, right).
Thus, the pE2-NeuTM hybrid overcame Her-2 immune tolerance regardless of their intrinsic level of tolerance to Her-2,
inducing tumor rejection while triggering immune priming
to additional tumor-associated antigens.
Efficacy of one preventive and three therapeutic
vaccinations
To further test the efficacy of pE2TM and pE2-NeuTM in
more stringent conditions, BALB Her-2 and B6 Her-2 Tg mice
were electrovaccinated once before they were inoculated s.c.
with D2F2/E2 and E0771/E2 cells, respectively (Fig. 5A). Mice
then received three weekly vaccinations following tumor
inoculation. In B6 Her-2 Tg mice, Treg were depleted before
the first vaccination. Her-2 antibody production was evident after a single vaccination with the hybrid DNA and tumor inoculation. Antibody levels continued to escalate with repeated
vaccination (Fig. 5B and D, left). In both strains of mice,

Improved Her-2 DNA Vaccines Contain Heterologous Neu Codons

10 in pE2TM-vaccinated and 1 of 10 in pE2-NeuTM–vaccinated
mice) although high levels of Her-2 antibodies were induced
by pE2-NeuTM. However, the average volume of tumors in
immunized mice was significantly reduced compared with
the pVax1 group. When primary cultures of E0771/E2 tumors
were prepared at week 7, little to no Her-2 expression was
detected even in mice which received the pVax1 control vector. Therefore, loss of Her-2 expression in vivo muted the excellent anti–Her-2 immunity induced by vaccination.
These results showed the efficacy of DNA vaccination
against Her-2–expressing tumors when administered as
one preventive and three therapeutic vaccines. The vaccine
specificity was further illustrated by the rejection of D2F2/
E2 tumors which retained Her-2 expression in vivo, but less
so of E0771/E2 tumors, which lost Her-2 expression in vivo.

Discussion
A new vaccination regimen that presented heterologous
rat neu together with self Her-2 in a cocktail or as a hybrid
construct significantly improved anti–Her-2 immunity and
protective activity in Her-2 Tg mice of three different genetic
backgrounds. Most notably, seven of eight tumors in BALB
Her-2 Tg mice were rejected after one preventive and three
therapeutic vaccination with pE2-NeuTM. Antibody response
was highly elevated by the cocktail or pE2-NeuTM hybrid vaccine, even though neu itself did not induce Her-2–binding
antibodies, suggesting immune stimulation by the foreign
epitopes in neu. On the contrary, heterologous pNeuTM induced significantly more Her-2–reactive T cells than self
pE2TM, but elevated T-cell response was evident only after
repeated pNeuTM immunization, showing a delayed yet eventually more profound T-cell activation by cross-reactive
T-cell epitopes from neu. This disparity in antibody and
T-cell responses induced by heterologous Her-2/neu antigen
was consistent with our previous report (23).
The NH2 terminus of Her-2 showed greater immunogenicity in both wild-type BALB/c and BALB Her-2 Tg mice,
whereas heterologous neu residues 501 to 688 were important in overcoming Her-2 tolerance as both pNeu-E2TM or
pE2-Neu500TM lacking neu amino acids 501 to 688 were less
effective. After Treg depletion, Her-2 antibody response to
pE2-Neu500TM approached that of pNeu-E2TM and may indicate activation of Treg by Her-2 residues 501 to 687. Based on
these findings, it may be possible to design hybrid vaccines
targeting other tumor-associated antigens once the critical
regions for immune activation in self and heterologous antigens are defined.
The high level of sequence identity and the similarity in
three-dimensional structures of Her-2 and neu enabled the
generation of stable fusion proteins E2-NeuTM, E2-Neu500TM,
and Neu-E2TM to facilitate vaccine development. Incorporation of strong foreign epitopes such as tetanus toxin, rather
than heterologous neu may also enhance the immune response to Her-2, but without the benefit of shared epitopes.
When extrapolating from these findings to new vaccines,
the high level of sequence identity between Her-2 and

www.aacrjournals.org

neu (88%) or between Her-2 and mouse ErbB-2 (84%)
should be noted. It is possible that only a highly homologous sequence from a xenogeneic origin is effective in overcoming self-tolerance.
IFN-γ–producing T cells can be detected in the PBL of
Her-2 Tg mice. It is therefore possible to measure T-cell activity with pooled PBL and monitor tumor growth in the
same group of mice. In NeuT mice, IFN-γ–producing T-cells
were not found in the PBL, although they were readily detected in the spleens (Table 1). It is possible that circulating
neu-specific T cells extravagated and localized in the 10
mammary glands which expressed large quantities of neu,
and thus, are below detection in PBL.
When pE2-NeuTM was administered as one preventive followed by three therapeutic vaccinations, D2F2/E2 tumors
which retained Her-2 expression in vivo were rejected in seven
of eight BALB Her-2 Tg mice, demonstrating the efficacy of
DNA vaccine in this more stringent setting. Comparable levels
of Her-2 antibodies were induced in B6 Her-2 Tg mice following
the same vaccination regimen after Treg depletion. Although
average tumor growth was slowed in pE2-NeuTM–immunized
mice for several weeks, rejection of the E0771/E2 tumor was
poor because these tumor cells lost Her-2 expression in vivo.
Unlike syngeneic mice, humans are heterogeneous in their
genetic background. With Her-2 Tg mice in BALB, B6, and F1
background, variation in immune responses to Her-2 vaccine
became evident (15). Using hybrid pE2-NeuTM, even the most
tolerant B6 Her-2 Tg mice responded with a striking complete
protection from tumor challenge. With one preventive and
three therapeutic vaccinations, hybrid pE2-NeuTM induced
significant tumor rejection in BALB Her-2 Tg mice. The concurrent presentation of self and heterologous antigen in a
cocktail or in a hybrid construct augmented anti–Her-2 immunity, and thus, should be considered for future vaccine design.
