ABSTRACT
The JAK/STAT pathway is constitutively activated in myeloproliferative
neoplasms and can be inhibited by ruxolitinib, a selective JAK1/2 inhibitor. The
JAK2V617F mutation leads to constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation and potentially leads
to inhibition of Stathmin 1 activity via STAT3. In support of this hypothesis, we found
that, in HEL JAK2V617F cells, ruxolitinib treatment decreased STAT3 and Stathmin 1
association, induced Stathmin 1 activation and microtubule instability. Silencing of
Stathmin 1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and clonal growth, and increased
apoptosis induced by ruxolitinib. Stathmin 1 silencing also prevented ruxolitinibinduced microtubule instability. To phenocopy the effect of Stathmin 1 inhibition, cells
were treated with paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing drug, in association or not with
ruxolitinib; combined treatment significantly increased apoptosis, when compared to
monotherapy. Notably, Stathmin 1 mRNA levels were highly expressed in CD34+ cells
from primary myelofibrosis patients. We then proposed that an undesired effect of
ruxolitinib treatment may constitute Stathmin 1 activation and microtubule instability
in JAK2V617F cells. Induction of microtubule stability, through Stathmin 1 silencing
or paclitaxel treatment, combined with ruxolitinib could be an effective strategy for
promoting apoptosis in JAK2V617F cells.

some cases of MPN indicates that additional genetic lesions
or/and aberrant signaling pathways may be involved in the
pathogenesis and progression of the MPN [1, 2].
Stathmin 1, also named Oncoprotein 18 (OP18) or
Leukemia-associated phosphoprotein p18 (LAP18), is a
microtubule destabilizer that plays an important function
in cell proliferation, clonogenicity, differentiation, motility
and survival [3]. In normal hematopoiesis, high Stathmin 1
expression correlates with the proliferative ability of early
hematopoietic progenitors, and the downregulation of this
protein is required for efficient cell differentiation [4, 5].
Stathmin 1 knockout mice presented two human-like
phenotypes of hematopoietic disorders; megaloblastic

INTRODUCTION
Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative
neoplasms (MPNs), including essential thrombocythemia
(ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis
(PMF), are characterized by increased myeloid proliferation,
with predominant megakaryocytic, erythroid, and
megakaryocytic/granulocytic expansion, respectively, and
have a potential to leukemia transformation [1]. A gain of
function mutation, V617F, in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene
has been reported in most PV cases and in more than half of
ET and PMF cases [2]. However, the presence of multiple
disease phenotypes and the absence of JAK2 mutation in

anemia and thrombocytosis [6]. In malignant
hematopoiesis, Stathmin 1 overexpression was reported
in acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia and
myelodysplastic syndromes [7, 8, 9]. Notably, Stathmin 1
silencing reduces cell proliferation and clonogenicity of
leukemia cell lines [9, 10, 11].
Signaling pathways deregulated in MPN have the
potential to regulate Stathmin 1 activity. For instance,
PI3K, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 regulate the activity of
Stathmin 1 through its phosphorylation at serine 25 and/or
38 [3, 12]. More importantly, activated STAT3 binds to
and inhibits Stathmin 1, resulting in microtubule stability
in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and gastric cancer human cell
lines [13, 14], but Stathmin 1 has never been investigated
in MPN. Thus, we aimed to investigate, in a JAK2V617F cell
line, Stathmin 1 function and the effects of ruxolitinib on
Stathmin 1 activation and cell phenotype. We also aimed
to evaluate Stathmin 1 expression in CD34+ cells from
BCR-ABL1 negative MPN patients.

with puromycin, the efficient Stathmin 1 silencing was
verified by qPCR and Western blotting (Figure 2A).
We next evaluated the effect of Stathmin 1 silencing on
cell viability and proliferation, in the presence or not of
the selective JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Stathmin 1
silencing significantly reduced cell viabilty compared to
control cells, and had an additive effect with ruxolitinib
treatment (p < 0.05, Figure 2B). Ki-67 analysis revealed
that Stathmin 1 silencing significantly reduced cell
proliferation, but did not have additive effects with
ruxolitinib treatment on cell proliferation (Figure 2C).
Regarding long-term proliferative potential, Stathmin 1
silencing significantly reduced the number of colonies
(p < 0.05, Figure 2D). Since ruxolitinib treatment (100 nM
and 300 nM) strongly decreased colony formation, no
further effect of Stathmin 1 inhibition on colony numbers
was observed (Figure 2D), except in very low dose of
ruxolitinib (10 nM; Supplementary Figure 1).
We then investigated whether the Stathmin
1-silencing-induced decreased cell number was also due
to increased apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis revealed
that Stathmin 1 silencing did not alter apoptosis in
DMSO-treated HEL cells. However, Stathmin 1 silencing
significantly increased apoptosis induced by ruxolitinib
treatment at 300 nM (p < 0.01, Figure 3). Taken together,
these results indicate that Stathmin 1 silencing alone
decreases the proliferation and colony formation of
HEL cells. When combined with ruxolitinib, Stathmin 1
silencing amplifies ruxolitinib-induced apoptosis in
JAK2V617F cells.

RESULTS
Ruxolitinib treatment increases microtubule
instability
Given that STAT3 binds to and inhibits Stathmin 1
in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and gastric cancer human cell
lines [13, 14], we first confirmed the association of STAT3
and Stathmin 1 in HEL cells, which was abrogated by
ruxolitinib treatment (Figure 1A), possibly due to STAT3
phosphorylation inhibition induced by ruxolitinib [15].
Next, we evaluated the effects of ruxolitinib treatment
on Stathmin 1 activity and microtubule stability by
assessment of Stathmin 1 serine 16 phosphorylation
(an inhibitory site), alpha-tubulin acetylation (a marker
of microtubule stability) and confocal analysis of
microtubule networks in the JAK2V617F cell model. In
HEL cells, ruxolitinib treatment induced a slight decrease
in Stathmin 1 phosphorylation and a marked reduction
of alpha-tubulin acetylation, indicating increased
microtubule instability (Figure 1B). Confocal analysis
corroborated our results obtained with the microtubule
stability markers, evidencing that ruxolitinib-treated
HEL cells present a more diffuse microtubule network
(Figure 1C).

Inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling increases
Stathmin 1 activity and microtubule instability
in HEL cells
The effects of Stathmin 1 silencing, in combination or
not with ruxolitinib treatment, on microtubule dynamics and
apoptosis were assessed by the evaluation of alpha-tubulin
acetylation and caspase 3/PARP1 cleavage, respectively.
Immunoblotting analysis of shControl cells treated with
ruxolitinib revealed decreased alpha-tubulin acetylation
levels, indicating increased microtubule instability. In
contrast, Stathmin 1 silencing increased acetyl-alphatubulin levels and prevented the loss of microtubule stability
induced by ruxolitinib. As expected, ruxolitinib treatment
reduced JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation levels in both
shSTMN1 and shControl cells (Figure 4). In agreement
with Annexin V staining results, the levels of cleaved
caspase 3 and cleaved PARP1 increased upon ruxolitinib
treatment, and higher levels of caspase 3/PARP1 cleavage
were observed in shSTMN1 compared with shControl cells
treated with 300 nM ruxolitinib (Figure 4). These results
indicate that Stathmin 1 is involved in the microtubule
instability during ruxolitinib treatment, possibly due to the
downregulation of STAT3 activity.

Stathmin 1 silencing reduces cell proliferation
and clonogenicity, and increases the proapoptotic effects of ruxolitinib
In order to investigate the function of Stathmin 1 in
a JAK2V617F cell line, HEL cells were stably transduced
with lentiviral constructs encoding shRNA targeting
Stathmin 1 (shSTMN1) or a shRNA targeting a control
sequence (shControl). After polyclonal cell selection

Paclitaxel-induced microtubule stability
improves ruxolitinib response

Accordingly, paclitaxel plus ruxolitinib treatment
resulted in increased levels of cleaved caspase 3 and
cleaved PARP1 compared with paclitaxel or ruxolitinib
alone (Figure 6).

We next sought to evaluate whether
pharmacological induction of microtubule stability
by paclitaxel improved the response to ruxolitinib
treatment, in a manner similar to the of Stathmin 1
silencing. Notably, paclitaxel combined with ruxolitinib
treatment resulted in a greater reduction in cell viability
and higher levels of apoptosis, compared with each
treatment alone (Figure 5; p < 0.05). Western blot
analysis indicated that paclitaxel was able to induce
Stathmin 1 phosphorylation at serine 16 (an inhibitory
site), overlapping the ruxolitinib effect and maintaining
high levels of microtubule stability (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
The relevance of Stathmin 1 in hematological
malignancies has been well described in acute leukemia
and lymphoma [7, 8, 9, 17, 21, 22]. However, studies
addressing Stathmin 1 expression and function in
MPN are still lacking. Using the JAK2V617F HEL cell

model, we observed that Stathmin 1 silencing reduced
cell proliferation and clonal growth. These findings
are in agreement with our previous results in U937
(myeloid leukemia cell line) and Namalwa (lymphoid
leukemia cell line) cells [9], and in the BCR-ABL1
K562 cells, as reported by two independent groups
[10, 11]. Importantly, in HEL cells, Stathmin 1 silencing
presented an additional effect, futher reducting of
cell viability and increasing the apoptosis induced by
ruxolitinib, a selective JAK1/2 inhibitor approved by
the FDA for the treatment of intermediate and high-risk
PMF. In PMF patients, results from a phase III clinical
trial demonstrated that ruxolitinib is well-tolerated,
reduces inflammatory cytokines and splenomegaly,
and ameliorates constitutional symptoms, but does not
reverse bone marrow fibrosis [23, 24, 25], suggesting a
requirement of additional therapeutic strategies. Thus,
preclinical studies using combined drugs are emerging
in an attempt to improve the response to JAK inhibitors
[26, 27, 28, 29, 30].
Ruxolitinib inhibits the constitutional activation
of the JAK/STAT pathway, including STAT3 [15]. The
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cross-talk between STAT3 and Stathmin 1 signaling
has been previously described in other cell lines from
mice (NSC-34 mouse motor neuron-like hybrid cells),
rats (PC12 pheochromocytoma cells) [31] and humans
(Hut78 T-lymphoma cells [13], and SGC7901 and
MGC803 gastric cancer cells [14]). STAT3 is a nuclear
transcriptional activator that also induces microtubule
stability by the inactivation of Stathmin 1 in the cytoplasm
[13, 14]. We then identified the cross-talk between STAT3
and Stathmin 1 signaling, also in HEL cells. Ruxolitinib
downregulated STAT3 activity and STAT3/Stathmin 1
association, releasing and activating Stathmin 1 and
increasing microtubule instability. Corroborating
this hypothesis, microtubule stability was rescued by
Stathmin 1 silencing during ruxolitinib treatment.
In order to verify whether microtubule stability
might be involved in the improved response of
Stathmin 1 silenced cells to ruxolitinib, paclitaxel
was used. Paclitaxel is a microtubule-targeted
chemotherapeutic drug that induces microtubule
polymerization, cell-cycle block at the metaphaseanaphase transition and cell death, and is the first line

treatment for specific solid tumors [32]. Interestingly,
combined paclitaxel plus ruxolitinib treatment resulted
in a significant reduction in cell viability and increased
apoptosis, compared to monotherapy. In HEL cells,
we then observed that paclitaxel treatment resulted
in the same cell phenotype, as induced by Stathmin 1
silencing. Our results are summarized and illustrated in
Figure 7D.
Stathmin 1 expression was found to be upregulated
in CD34+ cells from PMF patients. This finding can not
yet be fully explained. In solid tumors, high Stathmin 1

expression correlates with tumor growth and progression
[3]. Of note, Stathmin 1 expression is associated with
the proliferative potential of early hematopoietic
progenitors [4]. Evidence from ex vivo studies indicate
that PMF CD34+ cells have a proliferative advantage,
when compared to normal CD34+ cells [33]. Thus,
we speculate that the high expression of Stathmin 1
in PB CD34+ PMF samples may contribute to the
increased proliferative potential during early stages of
cell differentiation. In contrast, in differentiated-MPN
cells, Stathmin 1 inhibition and STAT3 activation

consequently releases Stathmin 1 and leads to microtubule instability. Paclitaxel treatment overcomes the effect of ruxolitinib treatment,
inhibiting Stathmin 1 and increasing microtubule stability. Abbreviations: Ac: acetylation.

may predominate. An important study recently found
that Stat3 deletion increased hematopoietic stem
cell compartments in Jak2V617F knock-in mice [34],
corroborating the relevance of STAT3 activation in
differentiated cells. It should also be pointed out that
gene expression analysis may not reflect the protein
activity in primary MPN cells. Given the relevance of
Stathmin 1 in HEL JAK2V617F cells, herein identified,
further studies to better elucidate the participation of
Stathmin 1/STAT3 axis in primary samples from PMF
patients will be of importance.
We then proposed that an undesired effect
of ruxolitinib treatment may constitute Stathmin 1
activation and microtubule instability in JAK2V617F cells.
Pharmacologic inhibition of Stathmin 1, in association
with ruxolitinib treatment, may be an interesting strategy
for inducing apoptosis in JAK2V617F cells. Our findings add
new insights for Stathmin 1 involvement in the JAK2V617F
signaling pathway in MPN.

JAK2V617F mutation, 20 for CALR exon 9 indel mutation,
9 were double negative for both mutations, and 1 patient was
JAK2 wild-type but had not been tested for CALR mutation.
JAK2 and CALR mutations were investigated as previously
described [36, 37].

HEL cells treated or not with ruxolitinib (100 or
300 nM) for 48 hours, were attached on cover slips
coated with poly-L-lisine (1 mg/mL), fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton
X-PBS and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
PBS. Cells were then incubated with anti-alpha-tubulin
Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate (1:200 in 3% BSA PBS;
eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) for 12 hours, and
followed by three PBS washes. The slides were mounted
in ProLong Gold Anti-Fade Mounting Medium with DAPI
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Images were
generated using a confocal laser-scanning microscope
(LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, UK).

Cell culture and chemical reagents
The HEL cell line, which is known to harbor
the JAK2V617F mutation, was obtained from ATCC,
Philadelphia, PA, USA. Cells were cultured in RPMI
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and glutamine
with penicillin/streptomycin and amphotericin B,
and maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2. Ruxolitinib, a
selective JAK1/2 inhibitor, was obtained from Novartis
Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland). Paclitaxel, a
microtubule-stabilizing drug, was obtained from INTAS
Pharmaceuticals (Ahmedabd, India).

Lentivirus transduction
HEL cells were transduced with lentivirusmediated  shRNA nonspecific control (sc-108080) or
lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting Stathmin 1 (containing
three target-specific constructs; sc-36127-V) from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
named shControl and shSTMN1 cells, respectively.
Briefly, 2  ×105 cells were transduced with lentivirus by
spinoculation at multiplicity of infection equal to 1 and
selected by 0.75 μg/mL puromycin.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with an
ABI 7500 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) with specific primers for
Stathmin 1 (forward: AGCCCTCGGTCAAAAGAATC;
reverse: TTCAAGACCTCAGCTTCATGGG) [38]
and HPRT (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1;
forward: GAACGTCTTGCTCGAGATGTGA; reverse:
TCCAGCAGGTCAGCAAAGAAT).
The
relative
quantification value was calculated using the equation
2-ΔΔCT [39]. A negative ‘No Template Control’ was
included for each primer pair. The dissociation protocol
was performed at the end of each run to check for nonspecific amplification. Three replicas were run on the same
plate for each sample.

Methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) assay
Cell viability was measured by MTT assay.
ShControl and shSTMN1 cells were serum-starved in
0.5% FBS for 12 hours. A total of 2.5 × 104 cells per well
were then cultured in a 96-well plate in RPMI 10% FBS in
presence or not of ruxolitinib (100 and 300 nM). Paclitaxel
(5 and 10 nM) was also used in the presence or not of
ruxolitinib (300 nM). Next, 10 μL of a 5 mg/mL solution
of MTT were added to the wells followed by incubation at
37°C for 4 hours. The reaction was stopped using 100 μL
of 0.1N HCl in anhydrous isopropanol. Cell viability was
evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm, using
an automated plate reader. All conditions were tested in
six replicates.

Immunoprecipitation and Western blot
Equal amounts of protein were used for total extracts
or for immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies,
followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with
the indicated antibodies (carried out using the ECL™
Western Blotting Analysis System; Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK), as previously
described. Antibodies against p-Stathmin 1 (p-OP18

concentrations of ruxolitinib (100 or 300 nM) for 48
hours, fixed with 70% ethanol and stored at −20°C.
Ki-67 staining was performed following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Ki-67 FITC clone B56; BD Bioscience,
San Jose, CA, USA) and the mean of fluorescence
intensity (M.F.I) was obtained by flow cytometry using a
FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). IgG
isotype was used as negative control for each condition.
Ten thousand events were acquired for each sample.

Colony formation was carried out in semisolid
methyl cellulose medium (1×103 cell/mL; MethoCult
4230; StemCell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC,
Canada). Colonies were detected after 10 days of culture
by adding 1 mg/mL of MTT reagent and scored by Image
J quantification software (U.S. National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Cells were seeded on 24-well plates and treated or
not with different concentrations of ruxolitinib (100 or
300 nM) and/or paclitaxel (5 or 10 nM) for 48 hours.
Cells were then washed twice with ice cold PBS and
resuspended in binding buffer containing 1 μg/mL PI
and 1 μg/mL APC labeled Annexin-V. All specimens
were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Becton
Dickinson) after incubation for 15 minutes at room
temperature in a light-protected area. Ten thousand events
were acquired for each sample.
