ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the most feared of all cancers because of its heterogeneity and
resistance to available treatments. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the cell population
responsible for lung cancer chemoresistance and are a very good model for testing
new targeted therapies. Clomipramine is an FDA-approved antidepressant drug, able
to inhibit in vitro the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch and potentiate the pro-apoptotic effects
of DNA damaging induced agents in several cancer cell lines. Here, we investigated the
potential therapeutic effect of desmethylclomipramine (DCMI), the active metabolite
of Clomipramine, on the CSCs homeostasis. We show that DCMI inhibits lung CSCs
growth, decreases their stemness potential and increases the cytotoxic effect of
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Being DCMI an inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin
ligase Itch, we also verified the effect of Itch deregulation on CSCs survival. We
found that the siRNA-mediated depletion of Itch induces similar anti-proliferative
effects on lung CSCs, suggesting that DCMI might exert its effect, at least in part, by
inhibiting Itch. Notably, Itch expression is a negative prognostic factor in two primary
lung tumors datasets, supporting the potential clinical relevance of Itch inhibition to
circumvent drug resistance in the treatment of lung cancer.

INTRODUCTION

tumor. Recent studies have demonstrated that a specialized
population of tumor cells named cancer stem cells (CSCs)
or tumor-initiating cells is thought to be responsible for
tumor initiation, progression and resistance to therapy [5].
We have identified lung CSCs and developed a technology
for in vitro and in vivo expansion and characterization,
which allow us testing and preclinical validation of new
targeted therapies [6, 7].
A current strategy to enhance the efficacy of
anticancer therapy involves the usage of drugs deregulating
autophagic processes. Autophagy is a conserved lysosomemediated process, which degrades cellular organelles and
macromolecules, allowing the recycling of bioenergetics
components in order to favour the survival of cells in

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
deaths worldwide [1, 2]. Most patients relapse after surgery
and require medical treatment like patients diagnosed with
a metastatic disease. Despite recent advances in treatment
of subsets of patients, the vast majority of patients
receive chemotherapy and soon become chemoresistant
[3]. This is the reason why the overall 5-year survival of
patients diagnosed with lung cancer is less than 15% [4].
Chemotherapy predominantly kills the drug-sensitive cells,
leaving behind a heterogeneous population of resistant
cells that gradually expand to produce a chemoresistant

response to diverse stress like starvation, hypoxia and
endoplasmatic reticulum stress [8, 9]. Besides its role in
the regulation of several biological processes, autophagy
is also known to be closely involved in many human
diseases, including cancer [9, 10]. However, the role of
autophagy in tumor progression is controversial and may
depend on various factors, such as the cancer type, the
development stage and the genetic background [11-14].
Currently, several drugs targeting autophagy process has
been tested and some of them are in clinical trials [15, 16].
Clomipramine is an FDA-approved drug generally used
for treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorders [17, 18].
It has a long-standing record with good subject tolerance.
Besides its function as noradrenergic and serotonergic
reuptake inhibitor, clomipramine acts as a regulator of
autophagy [19, 20]. Treating cells with clomipramine or
its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine (DCMI)
induces the blockade of the autophagic flux, as revealed
by the increase of authophagosomal markers and a
concomitant blockade of the degradation of autophagic
cargo, such as p62. Importantly, DCMI increases the proapoptotic effects of conventional chemotherapic drugs in
several cancer cell lines [21].
Recently, clomipramine has been also identified
as an inhibitor of Itch, an E3 ubiquitin ligase belonging
to the HECT-type family of E3 ubiquitin ligase [22]. By
controlling the proteasomal-dependent degradation of a
subset of target proteins, Itch regulates several important
biological processes, such as apoptosis, cell growth and
inflammation [23-25]. Several reports have demonstrated
that the expression levels of Itch affect the apoptotic
response induced by the chemotherapeutic drugs [26-28].
In details, it has been shown that Itch depletion by siRNA
increases the cytotoxic effect of anti-neoplastic drugs in
different cancer cell lines and the in vivo administration
of siRNA duplex targeting Itch mRNA is effective in

sensitizing pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine [29]. The
pro-apoptotic effects exerted by Itch depletion are more
evident in cells with no functional p53, highlighting the
importance that changes in levels of Itch may play in
majority of cancers, where p53 is absent or mutated.
In the present manuscript, we investigate the
biological effect of DCMI on the growth properties of
lung CSCs isolated from non-small-cell lung cancers
(NSCLC) surgical specimens. We report that DCMI
inhibits lung CSC growth, decreases their stemness
potential and increases the cytotoxic effect of conventional
chemotherapeutic agents. Being the DCMI an in vitro
inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, we also analyzed
the consequences of Itch downregulation on lung CSCs.
Similarly to what we observed in DCMI treated lung
CSCs, the siRNA-mediated depletion of Itch decreases
CSCs survival in response to gemcitabine treatment,
suggesting that the pro-apoptotic effects of DCMI might
be exerted, at least in part, by Itch inhibition. Notably,
Itch expression is a negative prognostic factor in several
primary lung cancer datasets, supporting the potential
clinical relevance of Itch inhibition to circumvent drug
resistance in the treatment of lung cancer.

RESULTS
Characterization of non-small cell lung CSCs and
their resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic
drugs
Two squamous cell carcinomas (LC1 and LC2)
and one adenocarcinoma (LC3) lung CSCs were isolated
from NSCLC surgical samples and characterized for the
presence of common genetic alterations exhibited by lung

tumors and for their ability to histologically recapitulate
the tumor of origin in mice (Table 1) [7, 30]. In serum-free
medium containing EGF and basic-FGF these cells grow
as tumor spheroids expressing stem cell markers such
as CD133. Upon serum addition the lung CSCs reduce
their stemness potential, as indicated by the decreased
expression of CD133 (Figure 1A).
Generally, CSCs are characterized by an elevated
resistance to the pro-apoptotic effects induced by different
chemotherapeutic treatments. To test this feature in these
lung CSCs, we treated lung cancer sphere-forming
cells and their differentiated progeny with cisplatin,

gemcitabine or paclitaxel at doses comparable with those
reached in the plasma of lung cancer treated patients and
measure the cell proliferation and/or cell viability by
ATP assay. In contrast to the differentiated progeny, all
three lung CSCs are markedly resistant to the growth
arrest/apoptotic effect induced by the chemotherapeutic
drugs even after a long exposure (Figure 1B). These
data demonstrated that the three lung CSCs possess the
expected features of chemotherapy resistance, supporting
their use in the search for new therapeutic options.

DCMI exerts a cytostatic effect in lung CSC

mainly ascribed to an effect on the stem cells population.
In supporting of this statement, we also measured the
sphere-forming capacity of lung CSC treated with DCMI.
As shown in Figure 2C and 2D, DCMI treatment reduced
both the number and the size of sphere-forming cells as
compared to non-treated cells, thus confirming that DCMI
negatively affects either the frequency of CSCs or their
proliferation potential.
In tumor cell lines the anti-proliferative effect
of DCMI has been associated with the blockade of
the autophagic flux. To verify whether DCMI might
exert similar effects on the authophagic machinery
in lung CSCs, we measured the protein levels of the
autophagosomal marker microtubule-associated protein
light 1 chain 2 (LC3) and p62, a cargo protein that is
degraded through the autophagic pathway [34, 35]. We
observed that DCMI induces a significant increase of LC3
lipidation in a dose dependent manner without triggering
p62 degradation (Figure 2E). The block of the autophagic
flux is not accompanied by a significant induction of the
caspase 3 activity, suggesting that DCMI exerts an anti-

Our group has previously demonstrated that
clomipramine and its active metabolite DCMI synergize
with gemcitabine in killing bladder, breast and prostate
tumor cell lines [22]. To verify the anti-proliferative effect
of DCMI in lung CSCs, we treated LC1, LC2 and LC3
stem cells with different doses of DCMI and measured
cell growth by quantifying the ATP content. As shown
in Figure 2A, DCMI induced a significant reduction of
lung CSCs growth and/or viability. Cancer stem cells are
characterized by an increased activity of the Aldehyde
deidrogenase (ALDH) and the quantification of ALDH
activity is commonly utilized to evaluate the percentage
of the stem cells in a certain cell population [31-33]. To
verify whether DCMI has a preferential growth inhibitory
action on the stem cell counterparts, we measured the
ALDH activity (ALDEFLUOR) and found a significantly
reduced content of ALDH-positive cells in DCMI-treated
cells compared to the control cells (Figure 2B). These
results suggest that the DCMI growth inhibitory activity is

proliferative rather that a pro-apoptotic effect in lung
CSCs. All together these findings indicate that DCMI
inhibits the lung CSCs expansion through inhibition of
their self-renewal and proliferation and these effects are
associated with a deregulation of the autophagic flux.

lung CSCs, we treated LC1 and LC2 cells with cisplatin,
gemcitabine or paclitaxel for 72 hours, in the presence
or absence of 10 µm of DCMI and then measured the
cell growth by quantifying the ATP content. As shown
in Figure 3A and 3B, DCMI strongly sensitized lung
CSCs to the toxic effect of the chemotherapeutic agents
as assessed by the cell viability assay. We next verified
whether DCMI together with gemcitabine might exert
a preferential growth inhibitory action on the stem cells
sub-population. To this aim, we measured the ALDH
activity in LC1 and LC2 cells treated with gemcitabine
alone or in combination with DCMI. We found that,
while gemcitabine alone slightly reduces the percentage
of ALDH-positive cells, the combination of DCMI and

ALDH-positive cells. All together, these results suggested
that DCMI treatment might be a valid method to increase
the cytotoxic effect of conventional chemotherapeutic
agents in lung CSCs.

been limited progresses in the therapeutic management.
However, the recent identification of CSCs as the cell
population responsible for tumor initiation, propagation
and resistance to therapy may provide an unprecedented
tool to develop more effective treatments [42, 43].
Therefore, it is not surprising that many efforts have been
concentrated to the identification and characterization
of specific inhibitors of CSC homeostasis in order to
attenuate their ability to survive conventional cytotoxic
therapies and promote tumor recurrence [44-49]. In
this report, we utilized as cellular model primary CSC
cultures from three NSCLC surgical samples that showed
the expected resistance to commonly used antineoplastic
agents. We found that DCMI, the active metabolite of
clomipramine, inhibits lung CSC growth, decreases their
stemness potential and increases the cytotoxic effect of
conventional chemotherapic agents.
Although we observed a slight increase of the
caspase 3 cleavage upon DCMI treatment, this effect is
not associated with PARP cleavage. It is possible that
DCMI does not trigger a significant apoptotic signaling
but rather it exerts a growth-suppressive effect due to its
effect on the autophagic flux. Clomipramine and DCMI
have previously described as inhibitors of the authophagic
flux in several cancer cell lines [21]. This mechanism is
preserved in lung CSCs. Although the role of autophagy in
controlling cancer growth is controversial and it is likely
to be tumor specific, many reports indicate that induction
of autophagy upon nutrient, growth factor or oxygen
deprivations, functions to maintain the survival of tumors
cells [9, 11, 50, 51]. Furthermore, many chemotherapeutic
agents induce autophagy, most likely by causing damage
to DNA, cellular proteins, and organelles [51, 52]. So it
is reasonable that inhibition of the autophagy program
might be a valid method to sensitize cells to endogenous
or exogenous stresses. Accordingly, inhibitors of
autophagy augment the efficacy of anticancer agents
in many preclinical models, indicating that autophagy
might be utilized by the cells to sustain cancer cells
against the effect of cytotoxic compounds, ensuring
thus the survival of transformed cells [11, 36, 37, 52]. In
agreement with these observations, autophagy inhibition
with hydroxychloroquine in combination with anticancer
regiments is currently in clinical trial for patients with
several refractory malignancies, including prostate, lung,
breast and brain tumors. In this scenario, we characterized
the effects of the DCMI-mediated autophagy inhibition in
lung CSCs and showed that DCMI treatment inhibits the
stemness potential of lung CSCs and potentiates the antitumoral effects of conventional chemotherapic agents.
Besides its effect as inhibitor of the autophagic flux,
DCMI has been recently reported as an inhibitor of the E3
ubiquitin ligase ITCH [22]. Itch belongs to the HECT-type
E3 ubiquitin ligase and controls the proteasome-dependent
degradation of several proteins involved in the regulation
of cell survival, cell growth and inflammatory response.

RNA-mediated silencing of ITCH impairs lung
CSCs proliferation
Recently our group has identified DCMI as an
inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Itch [22].
Similarly to DCMI, Itch silencing synergizes with antineoplastic agents in killing prostate, bladder and breast
cancer cell lines. To verify whether Itch down-regulation
affects lung CSCs homeostasis, we firstly tested three
shRNA oligos for their efficiency to decrease Itch protein
levels. We infected LC1 cells with lentiviral particles
expressing shRNA oligos targeting different sequences
of the Itch mRNA and identified sh-Itch #1 as the
more efficient Itch targeting oligo (Figure 4A). Then,
we analyzed the effect of Itch silencing on lung CSCs
stemness properties and observed that Itch depletion
decreases the sphere forming capability (Figure 4B and
4C). Importantly, we found that Itch silencing induces
a marked increase of the pro-apoptotic effect of the
gemcitabine, which is accompanied by a decrease of the
ALDH positive cells, suggesting that, similarly to what
observed in DCMI-treated cells, Itch silencing exerts a
cytotoxic effect towards the stem cell counterpart (Figure
4D and 4E). At molecular level, we found that Itch
depletion induces the activation of the apoptotic program
in gemcitabine-treated cells, as reveled by the increase of
the caspase 3 cleavage (Figure 4F). These results indicate
that down modulation of Itch expression decreases
the chemoresistance of lung CSCs and suggest that the
expression levels of Itch might be predictive to evaluate
the chemotherapeutic response and, as a consequence, the
survival of the lung adenocarcinoma affected patients.
To test this possibility, we assessed the impact of Itch
expression levels on patient survival by performing a
computational analysis in two publicly available lung
adenocarcinoma primary tumor datasets[41]. We stratified
the samples in two groups: patients displaying high
Itch expression levels and those with low expression.
Computation estimation of Kaplan-Maier in these two
subgroups revealed that high levels of Itch negatively
impact on patient survival (Figure 4G), indicating that
Itch expression is a negative prognostic factor on patient
survival and it might be functionally important to regulate
the tumor progression.

DISCUSSION
Despite the knowledge on lung cancer biology has
significantly increased in the last twenty years, there have

Among the substrates of Itch, the transcription factors p73
and p63 are particularly important for their involvement
in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation [24,
53]. p73 is a structural and functional homologue of the
tumour suppressing transcription factor p53 [54-57]. p53
is considered the guardian of the genome since it is able
to restrict cell proliferation or induce DNA repair in cells
exposed to different cellular stresses avoiding that DNA
damage is converted to inherited mutation [58-60]. A
variety of intracellular and exogenous stimuli are indeed
able to stabilize and activate p53 activity towards a large
number of transcriptional targets, including micro-RNAs,
pro-survival, pro-apoptotic, cell cycle and metabolic
genes [61-76]. Based on its important role in mediating
the cellular response to various stimuli, it is not surprising
that deregulation of its activity is strictly associated with
the onset and the progression of pathological processes
[77-79], mainly tumor development [80-82]. The most
significant evidence involving p53 in cancer is its high
mutation rate in cancers as well as its ability, when
mutated, to drive cancer metastasis [83-89]. Several novel
drug-design or high content screening is attempting to
use the p53 pathway for therapeutic application in cancer.
The majority of the drugs targeting p53 pathway are
exploited to induce p53 protein stabilization rather than
activate its transcriptional activity [90-92]. However,
more than 50% of human tumors harbor mutations
in the p53 gene. Therefore, drugs regulating the p53independent apoptotic pathways would be extremely
useful to restrict cell proliferation in the p53 defective
tumors. p73, similarly to p53, is able to mediate cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damageinduced cellular stress [56]. p73 is rarely mutated in
cancer and it is expressed at different protein isoforms,
exhibiting contrasting effects on cell tumor development
[55, 93, 94]. Specifically the TAp73 isoforms mimics the
tumor suppressive function of p53 and its expression is
maintained at low levels in mammalian cells by different
ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms, among them the Itchdependent degradation of p73 is the most characterized
[28]. Therefore, inhibitors of Itch activity might be useful
to activate p73-dependent apoptotic program in those
tumors harbouring p53 mutations. Although we do not
know whether the DCMI-mediated effect on lung CSCs
survival depends of its activity as inhibitor of autophagic
flux or inhibitor of Itch, we reported that the shRNAmediated inhibition of Itch expression potentiates the antiapoptotic effects of gemcitabine in lung CSCs, similarly
to what we observed in DCM1-treated cells. Furthermore,
we found that depletion of Itch decreases the stemness
capability of lung CSCs, as measured by clonogenicity
and ALDH activity assay. These results are in agreement
with several reports demonstrating that Itch is required for
both embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal capacity and
somatic cell reprogramming efficiency, through its control
on Oct-4 protein stability [95]. Moreover, while the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DCMI-mediated inhibition of Itch activity occurs at high
micromolar concentration in vitro [22], its effect on cancer
cell growth is evident at low micromolar concentration,
suggesting that DCMI might block cancer cell growth in
an Itch-independent manner.
We have also reported data showing that Itch
expression level is a negative prognostic factor on
patient survival in two lung adenocarcinoma primary
tumor datasets. This bioinformatic analysis suggests that
Itch levels might be predictive to establish an efficient
chemotherapeutic response of lung tumors. Furthermore,
this analysis also suggests the proof of principle to
concentrate our efforts in identifying and characterizing
more potent and specific inhibitors of Itch. Indeed,
although the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib is clinically
utilized to treat patients with multiple myeloma or
mantle-cell lymphoma, it is not curative and toxic in solid
malignancies, probably due to its broad biological response
[96-98]. Recently, preclinical studies demonstrated that
autophagy inhibition by hydroxychloroquine augments
the efficacy of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in
myeloma, indicating that the combination of autophagy
and proteasome inhibition might be clinically useful for
improving the outcomes of this neoplasia [99, 100]. Thus
targeting specific E3 ubiquitin ligases might represent a
potentially more effective therapeutic strategy, limiting
unwanted side effects.
In conclusion, although the mode of action of DCMI
should be further clarified, our data demonstrated for the
first time that DCMI treatment might be a valid approach
to regulate lung CSC homeostasis and their response to
chemotherapeutic agents, supporting a potential clinical
application.

The Aldefluor kit assay (StemCell Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada) was used to profile the aldheyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in lung CSCs. Cells were
incubated in Aldefluor assay buffer containing the ALDH
protein substrate BODIPY-aminoacetaldehyde (BAAA)
for 40 min at 37 C°. Cells that could catalyze BAAA to
its fluorescent product BODIPY-aminoacetate (BAA)

Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously
described [101]. Briefly, whole cell extracts were obtained
by lysing cell pellets with Triton Buffer (50 mM TrisHcl pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1mM EDTA
1 pH 8, 0.1% Triton), supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors. Lysate concentrations were

were considered ALDH+. Sorting gates for FACS were
drawn relative to cells baseline fluorescence, which was
determined by the addition of the ALDH specific inhibitor
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) during the incubation
and DEAB-treated samples served as negative controls.
Cells were sorted by a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

Statistical and data analysis
All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation
(S.D.). Statistical significance was determined by
ANOVA. And threshold was set at 0.05. A P-value < 0.05
is represented by a single asterisk, a P value <0.01 is
represented by a double asterisk.
Human lung adenocarcinoma sample data
was downloaded from the GEO database, accession
numbers GSE31210 (226 patients) and GSE11969
(149 patients). The analysis of the Kaplan-Maier
estimation curves was performed utilizing the
PPISURV bioinformatics tool (http://bioprofiling.de/
Results/PPISURV_1290_1434547360/main.html)
as
previously described [41]. Briefly, the separation of
patients into “cohort 1” and “cohort 2” along with the
survival information was used to identify any significant
differences in the survival outcome. The R statistical
package was used to perform survival analyses and to
draw the KM plots.
