Summary

Author Manuscript

We show that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) upregulate immune signaling in
cancer through the viral defense pathway. In ovarian cancer (OC), DNMTis trigger cytosolic
sensing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) causing a Type I Interferon response and apoptosis.
Knocking down dsRNA sensors TLR3 and MAVS reduces this response twofold, and blocking
interferon beta or its receptor abrogates it. Upregulation of hypermethylated endogenous retrovirus
(ERV) genes accompanies the response and ERV overexpression activates the response. Basal
levels of ERV and viral defense gene expression significantly correlate in primary OC and the
latter signature separates primary samples for multiple tumor types from The Cancer Genome

Introduction

Author Manuscript

DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis), such as 5-azacytidine (Aza) and 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine (Dac) are effective cancer therapies in hematologic neoplasms (Tsai et al.,
2012) (Matei et al., 2012) and are FDA approved for the pre-leukemic disorder
myelodysplasia (MDS) (Kaminskas et al., 2005). These cytidine analogues incorporate into
DNA, block catalytic actions of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and trigger their
degradation (Stresemann et al., 2006). Preclinically, low doses avoid early cytotoxicity and
DNA damage, allowing cells to exhibit apparent reprogramming and blunting of
tumorigenicity (Tsai et al., 2012). Mechanisms can include reversal of abnormal promoter
DNA methylation, re-expression of silenced genes including tumor suppressors (Baylin and
Jones, 2011), and changes to cancer signaling pathways including apoptosis, cell cycle
activity, and stem cell functions (Tsai et al., 2012).

A long recognized activity of DNMTis described by others (Karpf et al., 2004; Karpf et al.,
1999), and our group (Li et al., 2014; Wrangle et al., 2013), is induction of immune
responses in cancer cells. In recent clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
(Juergens et al., 2011; Wrangle et al., 2013) a small number of patients had remarkably
robust and durable responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy after first receiving
Aza (Wrangle et al., 2013). This immune therapy alone also has activity against NSCLC
(Brahmer et al., 2010; Brahmer et al., 2012; Topalian et al., 2012). A larger trial is now
ongoing to determine if Aza can indeed prime patients for sensitization to checkpoint
inhibition (Brahmer, 2015). For NSCLC and other tumor types, Aza induces interferon
signaling and concordant upregulation of surface antigens and their assembly proteins, viral
defense pathways, and transcript and surface protein levels of PD-L1, the key checkpoint
ligand targeted in the above immunotherapy (Li et al., 2014; Wrangle et al., 2013). Indeed,
we have defined a 300 gene expression signature we termed Aza-Induced iMmune genes or
AIM (Li et al., 2014) for which activation is greatest for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and
NSCLC (Li et al., 2014). Genome-wide expression of AIM separates primary EOC,
NSCLC, and other cancers into high and low expression groups (Li et al., 2014). We
hypothesize the low group may represent an “immune evasion/ immune editing” pattern
(Drake et al., 2006) (Schreiber et al., 2011) that Aza could reverse to sensitize patients to
subsequent immune therapy (Li et al., 2014).
We now show that a major mechanism underlying the Aza-triggered immune response is
induction of a cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing pathway used by epithelial
and other cell types as a viral defense mechanism that triggers a Type I interferon response
(Kulaeva et al., 2003; Sistigu et al., 2014). A key contributor is induction of increased
expression of multiple DNA hypermethylated endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). In The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the viral defense gene expression separates primary EOC

and other cancers into high and low expression and high tumor expression strongly
associates with clinical benefit in a trial of immune checkpoint therapy for advanced
melanoma. Aza sensitizes to immune checkpoint blockade in a pre-clinical model of
melanoma. We thus define a potential approach in which an epigenetic therapy may
sensitize cancer cells to various immunotherapies.

Results
DNMTis trigger viral defense and type I interferon signaling

Author Manuscript

Induction of AIM in a previous study of 23 EOC cell lines (Li et al., 2014) included, in
addition to previously reported DNA hypermethylated cancer testis antigens (MAGEA4,
MAGEA9, NY-ESO-1) (James et al., 2013; Karpf et al., 2009; Karpf et al., 2004; Odunsi et
al., 2014), interferon/viral defense, antigen processing and presentation, and host immune
cell attraction genes (Figure 1a). Direct Aza targeting of DNMTs for these changes is
suggested by similar findings in DKO colon cancer cells genetically disrupted for two major
DNMTs (DNMT1−/−, DNMT3B −/−) versus parental, wild type HCT116 cells (Figure 1a).
The induced responses may not be a general stress phenomenon as they do not occur with
carboplatin, a cytotoxic agent commonly used in EOC treatment (Figure 1b). Aza and Dac
incorporate into DNA, inhibiting 3 DNA methyltransferases (Schaefer et al., 2009), but Aza
also incorporates into RNA, inhibiting the RNA methyltransferase DNMT2. Aza thus can
demethylate RNA, and unmethylated RNA may activate TLR3 and the interferon response
(Kariko et al., 2005). However, Dac and Aza both mimic the DKO cell line results (Figure
1a, c, d; S1a, b) strongly suggesting that the drugs directly target DNA methylation to
trigger the interferon response.

Aza and Dac similarly trigger an interferon response that includes interferon beta (IFNβ1)
and a panel of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs; IFI16, IFI27, IFI44, IFI44L, MX1, OASL)
(Figure 1c,d, Figure S1a, b). Each ISG functions predominantly in anti-viral and antiproliferative signaling (Figure 2a). In four EOC cell lines, key upstream genes in the Type I
Interferon pathway (IFNβ, IRF7, and STAT1) were generally upregulated at the 4th day
following the end of Aza treatment (“Day 7”) and further increased by Day 10 (Figure 1c, d,
S1a,b). Importantly, cytosolic sensors for DNA (MB21D1/CGAS and TMEM173/STING)
and RNA (DDX41 and DDX58) were also variably upregulated (Figure 1c, d, Figure S1a, b).
In A2780 and TykNu, but not Hey or Kuramochi, cell lines, variable increases occured in
Type III interferon signaling genes, also involved in response to viruses (Ding and Robek,
2014). These included IFNL1 (IL28A) and IFNL3 (IL29) ligands (Figure S1c) and
especially the IFN III receptor IFNLR1 (Figure S1c), known to be methylated and activated
by epigenetic therapy (Ding et al., 2014).
Key viral RNA sensing proteins include TLR3 on the endosomal membrane and MDA5,
PKR, and RIG-I in the cytoplasm (Figure 2a). These induce IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB to
translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of IFNβ1 (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014).
IRF7 is frequently promoter DNA hypermethylated in cancer and the associated low basal
expression can be reversed by Aza in squamous NSCLC (Wrangle et al., 2013). Among 23
EOC lines examined, IRF7 was hypermethylated in only one, A2780 (Li et al., 2014)
(Figure S3a), potentially not a classic high-grade EOC (Anglesio et al., 2013; Domcke et al.,
Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 August 27.

2013). Aza induces partial IRF7 demethylation and increased expression in this cell line at
Days 7 and 10 while carboplatin did not (Figures S3a, 1b,c) and IRF7 knockdown
significantly reduced the Aza interferon response (Figure S3b,c). Such IRF7 induction does
not occur in two EOC lines or the HCT116 colon cancer cell line where the gene is not
hypermethylated (Figures 1d, S1a,b, S3a).

Author Manuscript

When IRF7 is not silenced, other mechanisms must then be operative for Aza to trigger viral
defense signaling. Secreted IFNβ is critical to this signaling and, through interaction with
surface receptors IFNAR1/2, activates JAK/STAT signaling, transcription of ISGs, and
resultant translation inhibition and apoptosis (Platanias, 2005) (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014)
(Figure 2a). Indeed, media transferred to untreated cells from Aza-treated cells 7 days after
drug withdrawal causes an interferon response with increased expression of ISGs IFI27,
IFI44, and IFI44L (Figure 2b). Moreover, Aza treatment induced secreted IFNβ in media
(Figure 2c, Figure S2a) and an IFNβ blocking antibody significantly blocked the Aza
induced ISG media response (Figure 2b). Like Type I IFN signaling, Type III IFN signaling
can be activated by viral infection (Robek et al., 2005) (Ding and Robek, 2014). However,
even though we observed upregulation of Type III ligand transcripts IFNL1 (IL28A) and
IFNL3 (IL29) (Figure S1c), secreted Type III interferon proteins are undetectable by ELISA
(Figure S2b).

Author Manuscript

Aza appears to activate Type I, IFNβ mediated signaling through JAK/STAT, as the JAK/
STAT inhibitor ruxolitinib strongly reduces ISG responses (Figure 2d, S2c). Further,
antibody blocking of IFNAR2, the IFNβ receptor, abrogates Aza induction of IFI27, IFI44L,
and IFI6 transcription (Figure 3a, S2d), as does inhibition of IFNβ itself (Figure 3b, S2e). In
contrast, blocking the Type III interferon, IL10RB receptor, gives only a modest block of
IFI27 increase (Figure S2f). IFNβ binding to IFNAR2 also may contribute to late, Aza
induced apoptosis that peaks at 4-7 days after Aza withdrawal, since anti-IFNAR2 leads to a
lower ratio of cleaved/total PARP (Figure 3a,c). (Figures 3c, S2f).
DNMTis trigger viral defense through induction of dsRNA

Author Manuscript

Aza-induced viral defense genes and IFNβ1 are not generally DNA methylated at promoter
regions (Li et al., 2014), thus Aza may activate the pathway upstream of these genes. We
considered increases in dsRNA, viral ssRNA, and unmethylated CpG DNA that might
trigger cytosolic sensors (Sun et al., 2013). Indeed, 3 days after ending Aza treatment of
A2780 and TykNu ovarian cancer cells and subsequent transfection into HT29 colon cancer
cells, known to have a robust interferon response (Chiappinelli et al., 2012), cytoplasmic
total RNA (without rRNA) and PolyA+ RNA, but not PolyA− RNA or DNA, increased
IFNβ1 transcripts (Figure 3d). Further, RNaseIII treatment of the cytosolic nucleic acids,
which specifically digests dsRNA, eliminated the IFNβ1 upregulation (Figure 4a), but this
was not seen with RNaseH treatment that digests DNA-RNA hybrids (Figure S4a).
If dsRNA is required for the above Aza effects, then the key cytosolic sensors, TLR3,
MDA5 (IFIH1) and RIG-I (DDX58), the latter two signaling through the mitochondrial
protein, MAVS, should be involved in subsequent IFNβ1 induction (Figure 2a). Aza
increased transcript (Figure 1a) and protein levels for these (Figure 4b). However, RIG-I,
which requires a 5’ triphosphate group on RNA for activation, is likely not a key player

since alkaline phosphatase treatment of cytosolic nucleic acid fractions did not abolish
IFNβ1 upregulation (Figure S4d). In contrast, knockdown of TLR3 and MAVS in A2780
cells (Figure 2a) decreased by twofold Aza upregulation of interferon genes IFNB1, IFI44,
IFI44L and IFI27 as did MAVS knockdown (Figures 4c,d; S4b,c). In TykNu, knockdown of
TLR3 and MAVS significantly blunted Aza induction of these gene responses (Figure
S4b,c). Importantly, knockdown of STING, the cytosolic DNA sensor (Mankan et al., 2014)
did not blunt Aza induced interferon signaling (Figure 4c,d). A previous report had
implicated STING in viral cytosolic sensing in B cells, but this was dependent upon viral
reverse transcriptase activity, likely to be low in our cells (Mankan et al., 2014). We thus
conclude that MAVS and TLR3 are centrally involved in Aza triggering cytosolic sensors to
induce an interferon response.

Aza-induced human endogenous retrovirus (ERV) transcripts can activate viral defense
responses in EOC

Author Manuscript

The above data suggests Aza might activate endogenous retroviral sequences (ERVs) that
constitute more than 8% of the human genome, can activate cytosolic RNA sensors, and are
silenced in normal somatic cells by promoter DNA methylation (Bannert and Kurth, 2004)
(Tristem, 2000) (Hurst and Magiorkinis, 2014) (Mankan et al., 2014). Some cancers lose
ERV DNA methylation and aberrantly overexpress ERVs (Chen et al., 2004; Cohen et al.,
1988; Larsen et al., 2009; Larsson et al., 2007; Rycaj et al., 2014; Strick et al., 2007; Strissel
et al., 2012; Wang-Johanning et al., 2001; Wang-Johanning et al., 2007) while others
maintain silencing. Aza can induce specific ERV transcripts in melanoma, choriocarcinoma,
and endometrial cancer cells (Laska et al., 2013; Ruebner et al., 2013; Stengel et al., 2010)
(Strissel et al., 2012). Indeed, in initial testing, the ERVK subfamily (Wang-Johanning et al.,
2003) transcripts increased 2.5-fold in the A2780 cell line upon Aza treatment (data not
shown). Upregulation of individual ERVs (22 full length env, 6 partial coding env, one full
length gag, and two partial coding pols) (Tables S1-S2), in PCR assays for non-repeat
sequences, occur especially, at Day 7, coinciding with ISG expression, in three EOC lines
following Aza and Dac treatment (Figure 5a,b, Figure S5a,b,c). These include several
known ERV env genes like Syncytin-1, ERV-3, env-K and env-H (Blond et al., 1999; Lower
et al., 1993; Mi et al., 2000; Rote et al., 2004) and at especially high levels, env-Fc2, a less
well characterized gene (Benit et al., 2003). Finally, in DKO as well as Aza treated A2780
and TykNu cells, loss of env-Fc2 promoter methylation correlates with increased Fc2
expression (Figures 5b, 6a-c, S6a) but not in Hey cells (Figure S6a).

Author Manuscript

Further linking ERVs with a dsRNA-triggered IFN response, bidirectional transcription
producing sense and anti-sense transcripts occurred for Syncytin-1 and five env-Fc2 gene
loci, but not β -actin, in three EOC lines and HCT 116 and DKO cells (Figure 5c, Table S2),
analyzed by the TAG-aided sense/antisense transcript detection (TASA-TD) technique
(Henke et al., 2015). Such sense and antisense transcripts can form dsRNA (Faghihi et al.,
2008; Su et al., 2012). Interestingly for TykNu there was a 6.69-fold increase of env-Fc2
antisense transcript levels compared to the sense transcript (Figure 5c) but substantially
lower antisense transcripts were seen in both HCT116 and DKO cells (Figures 5c, 6a).
Disrupting DNMTs seems integral to the above ERV upregulation since increases of envFc2 and erv9-1 occurred in DKO versus wild type HCT 116 cells (Figure 6a).

ERV transcripts seem directly involved in the Aza responses in that, first, although druginduced upregulation of ERV transcripts begins early after Aza, both ERVs and viral
defense gene increases generally peak by day 7 (Figures 5, S5). Second, ERV env proteins
such as Syn1 and ERV-3 are not increased after Aza treatment, supporting a dominant role
for viral defense signaling via RNA transcripts (Figure 6d, Figure S6b, and c). Third,
overexpression of ERV-3, EnvW2, and Syncytin-1 in TykNu (Figure 6e-j), A2780 (Figure
S6d), and Hey cells (Figure S6e), as compared to control genes, increase, at the transcript
but not the protein levels, the same interferon genes induced by Aza (IFNβ1, IFI27, and
IFI44L). The increases often exceeded that for the drug likely because total ERV RNA
molecules are higher in the overexpression experiments (Figure S6f-i). Finally, although
siRNA knockdown of individual ERVs (Syncytin-1, ERV-3) during Aza treatment produced
more complex results, targeting two ERVs significantly blunts the Aza induced gene
expression of IFI27, IFI44L, and IFI6 in TykNu cells, but not A2780 or Hey cells (Figure
S7a).
Importantly, a driving role for ERV transcripts in triggering Aza-induced viral defense gene
responses is evidenced by a high correlation of basal levels of both in 19 primary EOC.
Total molecules of 22 ERV env genes queried are increased (p<0.05) in tumor versus normal
(n=9) and divide tumors into lower (n=9) and higher ERV (n=10) expression groups as
compared to normal controls. High ERV tumors have significantly higher viral defense
response gene expression (p = 0.000141) (Figure 7a).
Viral defense gene levels divide human tumors into high and low expression groups that
track with responses to immune checkpoint therapy

Human cancers can evolve immune evasion to become less responsive to immune
modulation (Drake et al., 2006) (Schreiber et al., 2011). In this regard, basal transcript levels
for the Aza-induced viral defense genes group primary EOC, breast, colon, and lung
cancers, and melanoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies into high and low
groups (Figure 7b, Figure S7c-f). For EOC, this basal expression divides tumors into high,
medium, and low expression groups and the former two encompass virtually all of the
TCGA (Verhaak et al 2013) immune reactive (IMR), good prognosis tumors. The Low
group encompasses the PRO (high proliferative), poor prognosis subtype (p<0.001 to .0001
–Figures 7b, S7b)). Interestingly, virtually all of the right sided colon cancers with a high
DNA hypermethylation frequency phenotype (p<.002), termed CIMP, which have a high
burden of DNA mutations and respond robustly to immune checkpoint therapy (Le et al.,
2015), are in the High and Intermediate groups (Figure S7c). High mutation burden has
recently been defined as a key correlate to response to immune checkpoint therapy (Rizvi et
al., 2015) (Snyder et al., 2014). Similar sharp high versus low clustering is seen for
subgroups of breast and lung cancers and melanoma (Guan et al., 2015) (Figure S7d-f), the
last being very responsive to immune checkpoint therapy (Topalian et al., 2015) (Hodi et al.,
2010) (Weber et al., 2015).
Could the levels of viral defense pathway signaling correlate with improved responses to
immune checkpoint therapy? Indeed, for RNASeq transcriptomes of melanoma patients
treated with anti-CTLA-4, high levels of the viral defense signature expression in tumor

samples correlate with long term benefit (disease control [stable disease or better] >6mo as
measured radiographically) in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 therapy (Snyder et al.,
2014) (Figure 7c,d; Tables S5, S6). Importantly, high viral defense signature again
correlates with high mutational burden (Figure 7c).
Aza treatment potentiates immune checkpoint therapy in a mouse model of melanoma
In the B16-F10 mouse melanoma model, multiple combinations of low dose Aza directly
enhance tumor responses to anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint therapy (Figures 7e,f, S7g).
Further, B16 cells treated in vitro with Aza, then injected into mice and treated with antiCTLA-4, are even cleared completely (data not shown). Thus DNMTis can potentiate the
anti-tumor effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Our present data now provide functional context for our earlier reports that DNMTis induce
a complex set of immune pathway responses in tumor cells (Li et al., 2014; Wrangle et al.,
2013). DNMTis trigger cytoplasmic dsRNA sensing, central to cellular viral defense
responses, and activate interferon in EOC and colon cancer cells by disrupting DNMTs. This
activation could induce tumor attraction of lymphocytes (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014). There
are some important implications for one of the most exciting new developments in cancer
treatment, immune checkpoint therapy (Brahmer et al., 2012) (Berger et al., 2008; Brahmer
et al., 2010; Leach et al., 1996; Topalian et al., 2015) (Hodi et al., 2010) (Weber et al., 2015)
and for underlying mechanisms inherent to both tumor and host cells for reversal of immune
tolerance in tumor infiltrating T-lymphocytes (Pardoll, 2012). Indeed, our basal levels of
viral defense gene transcripts divide EOC, and other major cancer types in TCGA, into low
and high expression subgroups. Perhaps most intriguingly, such high basal expression in
tumors tracks with favorable patient responses in a trial of immune checkpoint therapy for
advanced melanoma, and strong Aza sensitization to immune checkpoint therapy is seen in a
pre-clinical mouse melanoma model.

Author Manuscript

A major trigger of the Aza-induced viral defense response appears to be bidirectional
transcription of ERVs that are known to fold into dsRNA secondary structures. ERVs,
representing more than 8% of the human genome (Bannert and Kurth, 2004; Tristem, 2000),
integrated into the genome of mammals between 0.1 and 40 million years ago via exogenous
retroviral infections of germ cells (Egan et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2001). Most ERV genes
are non-functional due to DNA recombination, mutations and deletions, but some produce
functional proteins including group-specific antigen (gag), polymerase (pol) with reverse
transcriptase (RT) and the envelope (env) surface unit (SU) with a transmembrane
immunosuppressive-like peptide (Mi et al., 2000) (Blaise et al., 2005; de Parseval et al.,
2003; Villesen et al., 2004). The env gene of ERVW-1 (chromosome 7q21.2) called
Syncytin-1 has an essential role in placentogenesis (Blond et al., 1999; Mi et al., 2000).
Importantly, and key to our findings, a major function of DNA methylation in humans is
silencing of ERVs and other viral sequences in the human genome; up to 90% of methylated
CpGs are located in 45% of the human genome harboring repetitive elements like ERVs
(Walsh et al., 1998) (Bestor and Tycko, 1996). However, ERV genes are unmethylated and

expressed in embryonic stem cells (Santoni et al., 2012) and especially Syncytin-1 is
epigenetically regulated throughout placentogenesis (Matouskova et al., 2006). Some tumors
have ERV demethylation and increased expression such as the ERV-K (HML-2) 5’LTRUTR in melanoma (Stengel et al., 2010) and the 5’-LTR region of several ERVs in testicular
cancer (Gimenez et al., 2010). A 20% overall mean demethylation of single CpGs in the
ERVW-1 5’ LTR regulating Syncytin-1 correlates with increased expression in endometrial
cancer (Strissel et al., 2012). Indeed, ERVs can be targeted as tumor-associated antigens on
melanoma cells (Cooper et al., 2015). In contrast, as in our present data, and those of others
(Maksakova et al., 2008), in some cancers, individual ERVs can maintain full or partial
promoter DNA methylation and low expression and DNMTis can induce ERV
demethylation and viral defense signaling in human embryonic stem cells (Grow et al.,
2015).

Author Manuscript

In addition to ERVs, other noncoding RNAs could contribute to the Aza-induced immune
response, such as repetitive Alu elements (Tarallo et al., 2012). UV light can damage small
nucleolar RNA and activate an interferon response via TLR3 (Bernard et al., 2012) and very
high dose (10 μM) Dac can induce an interferon response, apoptosis, increased ERVs and
repetitive satellite RNAs in p53-null mouse fibroblasts (Leonova et al., 2013). We suspect,
however, that such high Dac doses induce DNA damage rather than simply epigenetic
effects. Half of the ovarian cancer lines we studied (Li et al., 2014) have wild-type P53 but
we see no differences in Aza interferon response between these and those with mutant P53

Author Manuscript

The high translational connotations of our findings, including the small number of patients
in clinical trials for NSCLC who may have been sensitized by epigenetic priming to immune
therapy (Wrangle et al., 2013), remain to be validated in larger clinical trials. These are
ongoing for NSCLC (Brahmer, 2015) and planned for advanced ovarian cancer. Moreover,
ERV-K env proteins have been shown to increase immunotherapeutic potential of
melanoma, breast, and ovarian cancer patients (Rycaj et al., 2014; Wang-Johanning et al.,
2012) (Cooper et al., 2015). Also, our hypotheses that drugs like Aza might sensitize
patients with multiple cancer types to immune checkpoint blockade and other
immunotherapies are further strengthened by the data in our pre-clinical melanoma model.
For immune checkpoint therapy, in addition to the functional significance of our data, a
potential biomarker strategy is suggested by our findings in a melanoma trial. The high
correlation of viral defense signaling with mutational burden suggests that genetic changes,
increases in ERVs, and viral defense genes could predict response to immune checkpoint
and other immunomodulatory approaches. Finally, our drug approach to upregulate viral
defense signaling might be compared to the use of oncolytic viruses to induce inflammatory
immune infiltrates at tumor sites to sensitize to immunomodulation (Zamarin et al., 2014).

B16-F10 Melanoma Mouse Model

Author Manuscript

C57BL/6J mice were subcutaneously injected with 1×105 B16-F10 tumor cells. On days 4,
8, 11, 14, 18, mice were treated intraperitoneally with 100 μg anti-ctla-4. Mice received two
cycles of intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 to 0.75 mg/kg Aza in PBS for 5 consecutive days
followed by 7 days off treatment, starting at day 8 after developing palpable tumors, with
control groups receiving corresponding doses of non-specific isotype antibody control and
PBS intraperitoneally. Tumor surface was measured with a caliper using the ellipse surface
formula (Length*Width*π)/400.
Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

Mean +/− SEM qRT-PCR results were considered statistically significant with p values ≤
0.05 by Mann-Whitney U test or Student t-tests and 2-tailed p values are reported. Tumor
growth was assessed by two way ANOVA between each of the mouse treatment groups with
p values adjusted by the Dunnett multiple comparison test (df=512).
Normalized, level 3 Agilent expression data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas
data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and analyzed by R statistical software
(www.r-project.org) with existing packages and customized routines. Consensus hierarchical
clustering was performed with the ConsensusClusterPlus R-package (Wilkerson and Hayes,
2010) and data analyzed by the Fisher exact p value test for association between clusters
(p<0.05 *; p<0.01 **; p<0.001 ***).

Figure 7. Aza-upregulated viral defense genes are significantly correlated with ERVs in primary
tumors and correlate with sensitivity to immune therapy

Author Manuscript

A) Heatmap comparing basal levels of viral defense genes and ERVs in primary EOC. The
cut-off for lower or higher ERVs was the mean control tissue value of 237.57 +/− 83.05
molecules/ng RNA. Mean ISGs of the high ERV ovarian tumor (T) cohort (n=10) is 12.65fold higher than the mean of ISGs of the low ERV cohort (n=9). The (*) denotes that 8 of 10
high ERV tumors had significantly higher ISG expression compared to the low ERV tumors.
ISG expression is organized according to low and high ERV expression cohorts in arbitrary
units; color code from blue to red shows increasing ISG expression. For clusters (k=6),
differences are significant between the high ERV expression (2.5 +/− 0.37) and the low
ERV expression cohort (5.33 +/− 0.28). B) Interferon stimulated, viral defense genes
upregulated at least twofold by Aza in EOC cell lines (right y-axis) were used to cluster
EOC tumors for RNA-Seq data (blue = low; red=high) from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). EOC TCGA subtypes are shown: DIF (differentiated), IMR (immune reactive),
MES (mesenchymal), and PRO (proliferative) C), D) Viral defense gene signature is
upregulated in tumors from anti-CTLA-4 treated metastatic melanoma patients who derived
durable clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, or progression free-survival > 6
months as previously described (Snyder et al., 2014)) compared to those without benefit.
