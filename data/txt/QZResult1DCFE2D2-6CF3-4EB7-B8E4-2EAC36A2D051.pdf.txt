Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HAMLET is the first member of a new family of tumoricidal protein-lipid complexes that kill
cancer cells broadly, while sparing healthy, differentiated cells. Many and diverse tumor cell types
are sensitive to the lethal effect, suggesting that HAMLET identifies and activates conserved death
pathways in cancer cells. Here we investigated the molecular basis for the difference in sensitivity
between cancer cells and healthy cells. Using a combination of small hairpin RNA inhibition,
proteomic and metabolomic technology we identified the c-Myc oncogene as one essential
determinant of HAMLET sensitivity. Increased c-Myc expression levels promoted the sensitivity
to HAMLET and shRNA knockdown of c-Myc suppressed the lethal response, suggesting that
oncogenic transformation with c-Myc creates a HAMLET-sensitive phenotype. Furthermore, the
HAMLET sensitivity was modified by the glycolytic state of the tumor cells. Glucose deprivation
sensitized tumor cells to HAMLET-induced cell death and in the shRNA screen Hexokinase 1,
PFKFB1 and HIF1α modified HAMLET sensitivity. Hexokinase 1 was shown to bind HAMLET
in a protein array containing approximately 8000 targets and Hexokinase activity decreased within
15 minutes of HAMLET treatment, prior to morphological signs of tumor cell death. In parallel,
HAMLET triggered rapid metabolic paralysis in carcinoma cells. The glycolytic machinery was
modified and glycolysis was shifted towards the pentose phosphate pathway. Tumor cells were
also shown to contain large amounts of oleic acid and its derivatives already after 15 minutes. The

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Despite the molecular complexity of oncogenic transformation, cancer cells frequently
suffer from ‘’oncogene addiction’’ and the disruption of a single oncogene can either reverse
oncogenesis or be lethal (Weinstein and Joe 2008). The c-Myc oncogene is a classic
example (Felsher and Bishop 1999) and is deregulated in at least 40% of all human cancers
(Dang et al 2009). The broad transforming effect of c-Myc has been explained by its ability
to bind to promoters of at least 30 % of all known genes (Dang et al 2009) and in transgenic
mice, c-Myc overexpression combined with inhibition of apoptosis is sufficient to drive
pancreatic cancer formation (Pelengaris et al 2002). More recently, inhibition of c-Myc was
proposed to stop cancer growth and even allow tissue repair and reversion to a functional
phenotype (Soucek et al 2008). Healthy cells, in contrast, retain a limited replicative
potential, due to their susceptibility to programmed cell death, anti-growth signals and other
molecular interactions that limit longevity and maintain normal tissue homeostasis (Hanahan
and Weinberg 2000, Hanahan and Weinberg 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Oncogene activity may also cause a shift in the glycolytic machinery (Hsu and Sabatini
2008) and cancer cells are highly dependent on glycolysis (Mathupala et al 1997). Glucose
is first trapped inside cells by Hexokinases 1 and 2 (HK1/2) (Wilson 2003) and then further
converted to pyruvate. In contrast to healthy cells, cancer cells drive pyruvate to lactate
conversion even in the presence of oxygen, known as the Warburg effect (Warburg 1956).
Recent studies have shown that oxidative phosphorylation is functional in most cancer cells
(Vander Heiden et al 2009) and have proposed that the Warburg effect may reflect the
expression of the pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) (Christofk et al 2008), which
catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate and is responsible for
net ATP production within the glycolytic sequence. In contrast to healthy differentiated
cells, embryonic cells and most cancer cells mainly express the M2 isoform (Mazurek et al
2005) and in some tumors, replacement of M2 by M1 reverses the Warburg effect and
reduces tumorigenicity (Christofk et al 2008). In addition to PKM2, c-Myc plays a
fundamental role in reprogramming the metabolism in certain tumor cells and has been
shown to enhance aerobic glycolysis by directly activating genes such as HK2, PKM and
LDHA (Dang et al 2009, Shim et al 1997). The transcription factor Hypoxia-inducible factor
1 (HIF1) also regulates glycolysis by enhancing the expression of glucose transporters, HKs
and phosphofructokinases (PFKs) (Denko 2008).
HAMLET is a complex of partially unfolded α-lactalbumin and oleic acid, which
preferentially kills cancer cells and immature cells (Svanborg et al 2003). The broad
tumoricidal activity includes leukemia cells, carcinoma cells and glioma cells while healthy,

differentiated cells survive HAMLET challenge (Fischer et al 2004a). HAMLET thus
appears to target highly conserved survival mechanisms that are crucial for cancer cells.
This selectivity has been confirmed in vivo in a human glioblastoma xenograft model and in
a murine bladder cancer model (Fischer et al 2004b, Mossberg, 2010). In clinical studies of
skin papillomas and bladder cancers (Fischer et al 2004b, Gustafsson et al 2004b, Mossberg
et al 2007), HAMLET showed tumoricidal activity with limited side effects.
This study investigated the molecular basis of HAMLET sensitivity in cancer cells, using
screening techniques to detect features of transcription, protein interaction and metabolism
that alter survival after HAMLET exposure. We show that the sensitivity to HAMLET is
dependent on c-Myc and glycolysis and identified the glycolytic enzyme HK1 as a potential
direct target of HAMLET. The results also indicated that HAMLET alters cancer cell
metabolism and that it may disrupt glycolysis which is altered in cancer cells due to the
Warburg effect.

RESULTS
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

An shRNA screen identifies c-Myc and glycolytic-related proteins as modifiers of HAMLET
sensitivity
To get an unbiased overview of genes important for HAMLET sensitivity we utilized the
RNAi barcode screening technology (Brummelkamp and Bernards 2003, Silva et al 2005,
Silva et al 2008). Barcode screens use DNA microarrays to follow the relative abundance of
each shRNA vector in a large population of cells infected with a shRNA vector library
(Figure 1A). Using retroviral infection, we introduced a collection of 4603 shRNAs
designed to target 1650 cancer-related human genes for suppression by RNA interference
into A549 lung carcinoma cells, which are known to be HAMLET-sensitive. The infected
cells were split into three pools, one of which was left untreated and was used as a reference
while the other two were exposed to low (7 μM) and high (35 μM) concentrations of
HAMLET. After 2 hours of HAMLET treatment, we recovered shRNA cassettes by PCR
amplification and analyzed their relative abundance by hybridization to DNA microarrays as
described (Zender et al 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A small number of shRNA vectors were enriched or depleted in the population treated with
HAMLET; 43 inhibitory and 44 sensitizing shRNAs showed an absolute MaxMean score >
0.5 in both high and low dose treatment groups or an absolute score >2 in any group (Figure
1B and Table S1). The identified genes included oncogenes like c-Myc and glycolysisrelated proteins. shRNAs against HK1 and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A)
sensitized the cells to HAMLET (Figure 1C and 1D), suggesting that increased HK1 and
HIF1A expression drives a phenotype more resistant to HAMLET. In contrast, shRNA
targeting 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFKFB1) and c-Myc
rescued the cells (Figure 1C and 1D). Biological pathways enriched for by HAMLET were
identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the canonical pathways gene set
collection. The GSEA algorithm tests for the enrichment of a set of items within a larger
ranked list of such items. The identified pathways confirmed the importance of glycolysis,
as four glycolysis-related pathways significantly modified HAMLET sensitivity (Figure 1E

and 1F). In addition, the Ras pathway, which governs c-Myc expression, was identified as a
determinant of HAMLET sensitivity (Figure 1F).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The shRNA screen suggested that oncogenic transformation by c-Myc sensitizes cells to
HAMLET-induced cell death and that the glycolytic machinery influences the HAMLET
sensitivity of cancer cells.
The c-Myc oncogene determines the tumoricidal effect of HAMLET
We subsequently examined if the HAMLET sensitivity reflects c-Myc expression levels.
Human lung carcinoma cells (A549), kidney carcinoma cells (A498) and semi-differentiated
healthy kidney cells (HRPTEC) were exposed to HAMLET (21 μM) and ATP levels were
monitored (Figure 2A). A rapid reduction in ATP levels was observed in the lung and
kidney carcinoma cells but healthy cells remained unaffected after 3, 6 and 24 hours. At
higher HAMLET concentrations, a partial response was also seen also in those cells,
however (Figure S1A). The difference in c-Myc expression reflected the difference in
HAMLET sensitivity, as lung and kidney carcinoma cells show higher expression of c-Myc
than healthy cells (Figure 2B and 2C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To address if c-Myc activity influences HAMLET-induced cell death, A549 lung carcinoma
cells were transiently transfected with inhibitory c-Myc shRNAs or irrelevant shRNA and
reduction in c-Myc expression was confirmed after 72 hours (Figure 2D and 2E). Cells with
reduced c-Myc expression became more resistant to the lethal effects of HAMLET (21, 36
μM, 3 hours), while cells transfected with irrelevant shRNA retained their sensitivity, with
an LC50 similar to untransfected cells (Figure 2F). The results suggest that the level of cMyc expression is a direct determinant of HAMLET susceptibility in cancer cells.
As knockdown of c-Myc causes growth arrest in many cell lines (Watson et al 1991), we
deliberately induced growth arrest and tested the effect on HAMLET sensitivity. A549 lung
carcinoma cells were subjected to serum withdrawal or double-thymidine block and growth
arrest was confirmed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining (Figure S1B).
Growth arrest did not significantly alter the HAMLET-sensitivity (Figure 2G), indicating
that the effect of c-Myc on HAMLET sensitivity is independent of the growth arrest induced
by c-Myc knock down.

Glucose deprivation and inhibitors of glycolysis enhance HAMLET-induced cell death
The shRNA screen and the GSEA analysis identified glycolysis–related proteins as
determinants of HAMLET sensitivity. To directly address if glycolysis modifies the
sensitivity to HAMLET, A549 lung carcinoma cells were deprived of glucose for 30
minutes, HAMLET was added (21 and 36 μM) and cell death was quantified (15 minutes, 1
and 3 hours). Glucose deprivation sensitized the cells to HAMLET, causing a dramatic
reduction in ATP levels and Trypan blue exclusion as well as an increase in LDH release
and this effect was reversed by the addition of glucose (Figure 3A and Figure S2A-C). In
addition, the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), which inhibits glycolysis, enhanced
HAMLET toxicity in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B and Figure S2D, E).

To further examine the effects of glucose on the cellular response to HAMLET, Alexa Fluor
568-labelled HAMLET was added to cancer cells stained with Hoechst and examined by
real time confocal imaging. Glucose-deprived cells showed an increase in blebbing after 1
hour compared to glucose-fed cells and after 3 hours, more of the glucose-deprived cells had
changed morphology and showed strong HAMLET staining (Figure 3C). Furthermore, 3bromopyruvate, which inhibits glycolysis as well as mitochondrial ATP production (Ihrlund
et al 2008), significantly increased HAMLET-induced cell death (Figure S2F). Together,
these results show that cancer cells are sensitized to the lethal effects of HAMLET when
glycolysis is inhibited.
HAMLET binds to Hexokinase

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Potential binding partners of HAMLET in the glycolytic pathway were identified using a
high content functional protein array on which 8000 human recombinant proteins were
spotted (Figure 4A). Using stringent statistical filtering, 87 significant hits were identified
including nucleotide-binding proteins, protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins. The
glycolytic enzyme HK1 with a Z-score of 5.09 (Figure 4A) was one of the top scoring hits.
In addition, several glycolytic enzymes showed increasing signal intensity with rising
HAMLET concentrations but with lower Z-scores thus not meeting the stringent criteria for
a positive hit in this screen (Z-score >3 and replicate spot and inter-array CV < 50%). These
enzymes included PFKFB2 and 4 (Z-score 0.3 and 0.9), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Z-score 0.5) and PKM2 (Z-score 0.1). To confirm the binding of
HAMLET to the glycolytic enzymes, PVDF membranes were spotted with recombinant Histagged human HK1 and PKM2, rabbit GPI (93 % identical with human) and bovine serum
albumin (BSA) as a negative control. The membranes were sequentially incubated with
HAMLET or α-lactalbumin, goat anti-α-lactalbumin antibody and rabbit anti-goat HRPconjugated antibody. HAMLET bound strongly to human HK1 but not to human PKM2,
rabbit GPI or BSA (Figure 4B). This strong interaction was not seen with α-lactalbumin,
suggesting that the HAMLET complex has significantly higher affinity for HK1 than the
native, fatty acid-free protein.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Confocal microscopy was used to visualize HAMLET's interaction with HK1 in cancer
cells. A549 lung carcinoma cells were treated with Alexa Fluor 568-labelled HAMLET (15
minutes, 21 μM), fixed and stained with anti-HK1 antibodies (Figure 5C). Cells stained with
anti-PKM2 antibodies were used as controls (Figure S3). Untreated cells showed granular
HK1 staining with the highest intensity in the perinuclear region (Figure 5C). In HAMLETtreated cells, strong colocalization between HAMLET and HK1 was observed especially in
perinuclear, rounded aggregates. In contrast, only weak colocalization of PKM2 with
HAMLET was detected (Figure S3).
HAMLET reduces HK activity in cancer cells
To determine if HAMLET disturbs glycolysis in cancer cells, HK, PK and GPI activity was
measured in detergent-free lysates from HAMLET-treated A549 lung carcinoma cells (7, 21
and 36 μM) by coupled spectrophotometric assays. HK activity showed a dose-dependent
trend towards a decrease after 15 minutes of HAMLET treatment (Figure 4D) but GPI and
PK activities were not significantly altered. At this early time point, there were no changes

in cell morphology or in cellular HK1 levels (Figure S4A and S4B). ATP levels decreased in
a dose-dependent manner already at 15 minutes but lactate production was only reduced
after 3 hours (Figure S4C). The results suggest that HAMLET may reduce HK activity in
lung carcinoma cells.
Knockdown of HK1 or PFKFB1 modulates HAMLET sensitivity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To verify the shRNA screen and to father examine the role of glycolysis-related proteins in
HAMLET-induced cell death, A549 lung carcinoma cells were transiently transfected with
siRNAs targeting HK1, PFKFB1 and PKM2. Knockdown was confirmed by RT-PCR and
Western blots (Figure 5A, B and E) and the sensitivity to HAMLET was quantified by
measuring ATP levels and Trypan blue exclusion (Figure 5C, D). HK1 siRNA-transfected
cells showed a more pronounced loss of ATP in response to HAMLET (21 and 36 μM, p <
0.05) than the untransfected cells or cells transfected with control siRNA. In contrast, PKM2
siRNA did not change the sensitivity to HAMLET (Figure 5C). Similar results were
observed with Trypan blue exclusion Furthermore, knockdown of PFKFB1, which conferred
resistance in the shRNA-screen, decreased the sensitivity to HAMLET (Figure 5D). These
results confirm that knockdown of HK1 and PFKFB1 increase and reduce HAMLET
sensitivity, respectively.
HAMLET rapidly disrupts cancer cell metabolism

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To assess if HAMLET changes the metabolic state of target cells, we compared the
metabolomic profile of HAMLET-treated lung carcinoma cells (36 μM, 15 minutes and 1
hour) to untreated cells (Figure 6 and Figure S5). Three different untargeted metabolite
profiling methods were used to study the possible metabolic effects of HAMLET. Reverse
phase liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/MS)
was used to compare hydrophobic metabolites (e.g. lipids), hydrophilic interaction
chromatography (HILIC), LC-MS to study a wide range of polar metabolites, and gas
chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to profile core metabolites (Baran et al 2009).
By reverse phase LC-MS profiling 560 features were detected (including different adducts,
isotopes and in source degradation products of the same metabolite) defined by m/z value
and LC retention time (For the combination of m/z value and retention time, see Figure 6A).
The analysis revealed that 125 of the 560 features were significantly altered after 15 minutes
of HAMLET treatment (107 increased, 18 reduced). After 1 hour, the majority of 76 altered
features were instead reduced (22 increased, 54 reduced) (Figure 6D). As expected from the
uptake of HAMLET, the features with largest signal intensity in the HAMLET-treated cells
at both time points as well as several features with similar retention time were putatively
identified as different ionization and isotope variants of oleic acid, the lipid component of
HAMLET, based on exact mass and LC retention time.
Untargeted profiling using HILIC LC-MS was consistent with the reverse phase analysis,
showing significant metabolic alterations after HAMLET treatment. Of the 1120 features
that were detected, 103 were found to change after 15 minutes (28 were increased, 75 were
reduced in HAMLET treated cells) and 114 after 1 hour of HAMLET treatment (64 were
increased, 50 were reduced in HAMLET-treated cells). Several of these metabolites were
identified based on comparison of exact mass and retention time with analytical standards.

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, creatine, phosphocreatine, taurine and glutathione disulfide all
decreased in the HAMLET-treated cells, possibly reflecting a disruption in amino acid
metabolism and oxidative stress. The identity of creatine and glutathione disulfide was also
confirmed by subsequent MS/MS analysis. The results indicate that HAMLET rapidly alters
cancer cell metabolism.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

GC-MS profiling of cellular metabolites was subsequently performed in A549 lung
carcinoma cells treated with HAMLET for 15 and 60 minutes. By hierarchical clustering,
three separate clusters were observed, the first containing the control samples (15 and 60
minutes), the second the HAMLET-treated samples obtained after 15 and the third the 60
minutes samples, respectively (Figure 7A, Table S2). Overall metabolite concentrations
were lower in the HAMLET-60 samples compared to controls, confirming the general shut
down of metabolism identified in the untargeted profiling. To derive significantly altered
metabolites, a linear model was fitted to the data and metabolites with an absolute log2-fold
change of 1 and FDR-adjusted p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Twenty
metabolites were significantly altered after 15 minutes of HAMLET treatment (Figure 7B).
As expected from the known uptake of HAMLET, oleic acid and the oleic acid derivative
elaidic acid showed the most marked increase (120 fold, adjusted p-value = 4 × 10−6 and 84
and 8.1 × 10−6, respectively). In addition, a number of metabolites relating to the pentose
phosphate pathway were more abundant after 15 minutes, including gluconic acid (3.3 fold),
gluconate-lactone (2.6 fold), glyceric acid (2 fold) and pyruvate (1.7 fold) indicating that
HAMLETs binding to HK might divert the metabolic flux towards this pathway. Among the
metabolites that were significantly reduced were taurine, glycine, the citric acid cycle
intermediate aconitate and the polyamines putrescine and spermidine After 1 hour, 41
metabolites were identified as significantly altered (Figure 7B). Oleic acid (log2 fold change
of 5.1 and p=2 × 10−10) showed the second most marked increase together with derivatives
including elaidic acid and palmitoleic acid. Pyruvate and several other intermediates in the
citric acid cycle, including succinate, aconitate, fumarate and malate, were less abundant
after HAMLET treatment, confirming HAMLETs inhibitory effect on glycolysis.
Additionally, a number of key metabolites in arginine and proline metabolism were reduced,
including aspartate, glutamate and spermidine. Finally, confirming the untargeted
metabolomic analysis, HAMLET caused a depletion of metabolites relating to glutathione
metabolism. Together, these results show that HAMLET rapidly causes a massive alteration
of cancer cell metabolism which may in part result from a disruption of glycolysis.

DISCUSSION
HAMLET is the first member of a new family of tumoricidal unfolded protein-lipid
complexes that kill cancer cells broadly, while sparing differentiated, non-transformed cells
(Hakansson et al 1995, Svensson et al 2000). In addition to its ability to kill cancer cells in
vitro, HAMLET has shown therapeutic efficacy against skin papillomas and rapid topical
effects on human bladder cancers (Gustafsson et al 2004a, Mossberg et al 2007). In animal
models of human glioblastoma or bladder cancer, HAMLET has been shown to prolong
survival and delay tumor development (Fischer et al 2004b, Mossberg et al 2010). So far,
toxic effects on healthy tissues have not been detected, suggesting that HAMLET exploits
conserved features of cancer cells for its activity. Some of these conserved features were

identified here. The HAMLET sensitivity of cancer cells was shown to be dependent on the
c-Myc oncogene expression and the glycolytic machinery especially HK1 and PFKFB1, and
HIF1α, which is activated by hypoxia and oncogene activity and acts by enhancing the
transcription of glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters and LDH (Kim et al 2006,
Papandreou et al 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

c-Myc has been called ‘’the quintessential oncogene’’ (Li et al 1984, Nilsson and Cleveland
2003) but the effects remain paradoxical, as introduction of c-Myc alone in normal cells
cause cell death (Evan et al 1992). In cancer cells, c-Myc over-expression influences at least
30% if not all expressed genes, either directly or via different regulatory circuits. As
HAMLET has shown activity against >40 different tumor cell types from different species,
tissues and individuals, the sensitizing effect of c-Myc overexpression was expected. Tumor
cells which expressed higher levels of c-Myc died more easily when exposed to HAMLET
than healthy differentiated cells and knockdown of c-Myc decreased HAMLET sensitivity.
The c-Myc oncogene has been proposed to promote the Warburg effect and the dependence
of cancer cells on aerobic glycolysis. Thus, mutant c-Myc may make the cancer cells overly
sensitive to a deregulation of glycolysis by HAMLET. In addition to c-Myc itself the Ras
signaling pathway was identified as a determinant of HAMLET sensitivity by GSEA
analysis and c-Myc is activated downstream of Ras thus controlling cell proliferation and
survival together with other effectors such as PI3K. We have found that HAMLET causes a
shift from MEK/ERK to p38 signaling in tumor cells and that p38 is involved in the early
cell death response to HAMLET (Storm et al., manuscript in preparation). Healthy cells, in
contrast, are characterized by low intrinsic activity in the Ras/MAPK pathway and c-Myc
expression and maintain a balanced MAPK activity during HAMLET exposure, with little
p38 activation, consistent with their low HAMLET sensitivity. Furthermore, the c-Myc
oncogene has been proposed to influence the Warburg effect and the dependence of cancer
cells on aerobic glycolysis (Dang 1999). The oncogene addiction and high metabolic activity
caused by mutant c-Myc in cancer cells may make these cells overly sensitive to
deregulation of glycolysis by HAMLET, further linking the effects of c-Myc and HK1 to
cancer cell death.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Besides c-Myc, HIF1A, a second oncogene well-known to modulate cancer cell metabolism,
was implicated in regulating the sensitivity towards HAMLET. HIF1α acts by enhancing the
transcription of critical constituents of the glycolytic machinery, including glucose
transporters and HK1 (Dang et al 2008). It has been proposed that HIF1 alone can drive the
major metabolic changes that accompany oncogenic transformation, as identified by Otto
Warburg (Denko 2008). This synergy is consistent with the HAMLET sensitizing effects of
HK1 and HIF1 in the shRNA screen. In addition, deregulated expression of oncogenic cMyc collaborates with HIF1α to confer the tumor metabolic phenotype. Paradoxically, at
physiologic conditions HIF1α can inhibit the activity of c-Myc and HIF1α directly
influences the expression of MXI1, which binds MAX, thereby antagonizing the effects of
c-Myc (Zhang et al 2007). HIF1α also decreases c-Myc activity by attenuating c-Myc
protein levels through a proteasome-dependent pathway. In contrast to HIF1α, HIF2α has
been shown to stabilize the MYC-MAX complex, thereby stimulating c-Myc induced
transcription. The effects of c-Myc on HAMLET sensitivity are therefore not likely to only
reflect its regulation of glycolysis. In this regard, context-dependent c-Myc-mediated

transcription is crucially important for tumor progression and may be so for HAMLET
sensitivity as well.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The glycolytic state of tumor cells was defined as a determinant of HAMLET sensitivity by
the shRNA screen and extracellular glucose levels were shown to modulate the sensitivity of
tumor cells to HAMLET. Furthermore, the GSEA analysis of the shRNA screen identified
several pathways related to glycolysis as important for HAMLET sensitivity. HK1 was a
direct target for HAMLET, as seen by binding in a proteomic screen involving 8000 proteins
and in dot blots where the purified human HK1-HAMLET interaction was confirmed.
Inhibition of HK1 as well as the HK1-homologue HK2 would be predicted to reduce
glucose phosphorylation, thereby creating a state similar to glucose deprivation by inhibiting
glycolysis in cancer cells. The HK1/2 isoforms are associated with the mitochondrial
membrane, where they control glucose utilization. In addition, HK1 decreases voltagedependent anion channel (VDAC) conductance, thus protecting cells from cytochrome c
release and apoptotic death (Abu-Hamad et al 2008). In a parallel study, we have shown that
ion channel activation is a critical membrane event in HAMLET-induced cell death (Storm
et al., Manuscript in preparation), raising the possibility that in addition to its effects on
glycolysis, HK1 acts by modulating the interaction of HAMLET with ion channels in the
mitochondrial membrane. We have also seen that peroral HAMLET treatment of APCmin
mice with colon cancer modified the transcription of a number of glycolysis related proteins
(Puthia et al., manuscript in preparation) suggesting relevance of these targets also in vivo.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The shRNA screen also identified PKFKB1 as a significant determinant of HAMLET
sensitivity, but in contrast to HK1, PKFKB had protective effects. The mechanism behind
this is not immediately obvious as the four PFKFB isoforms possess opposing kinase and
bisphosphatase activities, with independent domains catalyzing the synthesis or degradation
of fructose-2,6-biphosphate, respectively. The resulting effect on glycolysis is determined by
the overall kinase:bisphosphatase ratio in each cell. PFKFB1, 2 and 4 have near equal kinase
and bisphosphatase activities, while PFKFB3 has stronger kinase activity (740:1) and is
overexpressed in cancer cells (Yalcin et al 2009). Knockdown of PFKFB1 may increase the
dominance of the PFKFB3 isoform resulting in higher fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels and
enhanced glycolysis. This would be consistent with rescue after PFKFB1 knockdown, as
reduced glycolysis in a cell with the Warburg phenotype appears to favor HAMLETinduced cell death.
Finally, a broad metabolomic screen demonstrated that HAMLET-treated cells rapidly loose
metabolic activity. HAMLET triggered rapid and profound changes in the metabolic state of
cancer cells, as shown by reverse LC-MS and GC-MS profiling. After one hour, the majority
of metabolites showed a reduction in intensity, consistent with the rapid suppression of
glycolysis and a resulting loss of energy required to maintain the normal metabolic
machinery, especially in cancer cells. The shift was dramatic, and it is plausible that the
rapid cell death response to HAMLET may result, in part, from this effect, as cells deprived
of energy and metabolic activity, are known to undergo cell death (Kroemer and Pouyssegur
2008). MS/MS analysis identified metabolites that were strongly reduced, including Sadenosyl-L-homocysteine, creatine, phosphocreatine, taurine and glutathione disulfide,
which are fundamental intermediates in the defense against oxidative stress (Balendiran et al

2004). Targeted GC-MS profiling identified large amounts of oleic acid in HAMLETtreated tumor cells already after 15 minutes, indicating that excess amounts of fatty acid and
saturation of the fatty acid metabolism machinery might be responsible for the first, rapid
response to HAMLET. Interestingly, members in the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP)
were also upregulated indicating that HAMLETs binding to HK1 might divert metabolism
towards this alternative pathway. Additionally, the initial, oxidative phase of the PPP is also
responsible for generation of anti-oxidant metabolites (Cairns et al 2011) and we could
consistently see a depletion of important glutathione intermediates at later time points. The
increased activity in the anti-oxidant pathways together with p38 activation might indicate
that reactive oxygen species are important for HAMLET-induced cell death.

Interest in the metabolic changes in cancer cells, such as their higher rates of glycolysis has
been reawakened by the discovery that mutations in well-known oncogenes affect cancer
cell metabolism and the advent of new technologies for studying a cells metabolome.
Clearly, metabolic pathways are highly interconnected with pathways that govern the
classical hallmarks of cancer, such as uncontrolled proliferation and resistance to cell death.
Thus, inhibition of glycolysis is becoming an important new therapeutic target. The glucose
analogue 2DG has been shown to kill several cancer cell lines in vitro, to inhibit the growth
of pancreatic cancer cells in nude mice and to enhance the effects of death receptor ligands,
radiation and cytotoxic drugs (Coleman et al 2008, Hernlund et al 2008). Currently, 2DG is
in clinical trials as single agent or in combination therapy. In addition, 3-Bromopyruvate
eradicated advanced cancers in rats without apparent adverse effects (Ko et al 2004).
HAMLET presents a new therapeutic option, potentially acting more broadly by inhibiting
glycolysis as well as other cellular pathways regulated by c-Myc- and Ras-dependent
transformation. The lack of HAMLET sensitivity in healthy, differentiated cells and lack of
in vivo toxicity in different tumor models also adds to HAMLET's clinical potential.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
HAMLET-production and cell culturing

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

α-lactalbumin was purified from human milk and converted to HAMLET by removal of
calcium and binding to oleic acid as previously described (Svensson et al 2000). For
microscopy HAMLET was labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen). The A498 human
kidney carcinoma cell line, the A549 human lung carcinoma cell line and the Jurkat human
acute T cell leukemia cell line (ATCC) were cultured as previously described (Brest et al
2007). The human renal proximal tubule cells (HRPTEC) derived from healthy adult kidney
(Lonza) were grown in DMEM/F12 medium with 15 % FCS.
Cell death assays, microscopy and cell cycle analysis
HAMLET was added to the cells in serum-free medium and for longer incubations FCS was
added after 1 hour. Where required cells were pre-incubated in glucose-free RPMI (Sigma
or Invitrogen), 2-deoxyglucose or 3-bromopyruvate (both Sigma). After HAMLET
treatment, cytotoxicity was determined by quantifying LDH release (CytoTox kit, Promega),
ATP levels (ATPlite kit, PerkinElmer or CellTiter-Glo kit, Promega), remaining cell
numbers or Trypan blue exclusion. For live cell microscopy, cells were seeded in a 35-mm

glass-bottom dish, nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 568labeled HAMLET (21 μM) was added and the cells were examined on an inverted LSM 510
DUO confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). For colocalization experiments, cells were seeded
on 8-well chamber slides, fixed in 4 % formaldehyde permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton
X-100, stained with anti-HK1 (Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-PKM2 (Milipore)
antibodies followed by secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488. The cells were
examined on an inverted LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). For cell
growth inhibition, A549 cells were cultured in 0.5% FCS for 48 hours or treated with
thymidine (Sigma, 2 mM in RPMI 1640 with 5% FCS) for 16 hours, followed by 16 hours
in normal media and another 16 hours in thymidine-containing media (Thomas and
Lingwood 1975). Cell cycle analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur device (BD
Biosciences) after fixation in 80% methanol and staining with propidium iodide (Sigma).
shRNA screen

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The microRNA-based shRNA library used for screening was pooled from several focused
sets comprised of 10,000 shRNAs targeting approximately 3000 cancer-relevant genes.
Retrovirus was prepared from packaging cells and the viral supernatant was used to infect
A549 cells at single copy integration per cell. Following puromycin selection, three groups
of cells each in triple replicates were used for HAMLET treatment: Mock treatment with
vehicle, low dose (IC20, 7 μM), and high dose (IC80, 35 μM). After 2 hours of incubation at
37°C, genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets and a 350 bp fragment harboring full
barcode and half hairpin was amplified by PCR, purified, labeled with fluorescence dye and
hybridized to the Agilent 8-plex array chips. All slides were processed following the
manufacturer's instructions and scanned using an Axon 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments)
at 5 micron per pixel resolution. After normalization (Smyth and Speed 2003), signals from
duplicate features were averaged, values were log2-transformed and changes were scored
using the MaxMean method. For the GSEA analysis the javaGSEA Desktop Application
was used (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/) with the c2.cp.v.25 gene set collection
comparing all HAMLET-treated samples (n=8) against PBS-treated controls (n=4). P-values
were derived by 10 000 permutation of the gene sets.
RNA interference and RT-PCR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

c-Myc shRNA experiments were performed using Fugene HD (Roche Diagnostics) at a ratio
of 4:2 with plasmids generating shRNAs to c-Myc (Genecopoeia). HK1, PFKFB1 and
PKM2 siRNA (Qiagen) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 42
hours (HK1, PKM2, PFKFB1) or 72 hours (c-Myc) knockdown was examined by RT-PCR
and Western blot and cells were used for viability assays. For RT-PCR RNA was prepared
with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and real-time PCR was performed on a Rotorgene 2000
(Corbett Life Science, Sydney, Australia) or ABI 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems)
using QuantiTect Primer Assays for HK1, PFKFB1, PKM2 and PPIA (QIAGEN).
Western blot
Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in NP-40 buffer in modified RIPA buffer or
SDS buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Equal

same number of cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes.
Membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-c-Myc (Epitomics), mouse anti-Actin (SigmaAldrich), rabbit anti-PKM2 (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-HK1 (Milipore), rabbit
anti-PFKFB1 (Abcam) or mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (Novus Biologicals) overnight at
4°C and bound antibodies were detected using corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies.
Protein array and HAMLET far-Western blot

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A screen for possible interaction partners for HAMLET was performed on a ProtoArray®
Human Protein Microarray v4.0 using Invitrogen's Protein-Protein Interaction Profiling
Service at Invitrogen as previously described (Satoh et al 2006). Briefly, arrays were probed
with Alexa Fluor 568-labelled HAMLET in 2 concentrations (5 and 50 ng/μl) in duplicate
and signals were compared to a negative control array incubated without HAMLET.
Proteins were defined as positive hits if the Z-score was greater than 3 standard deviations
above the mean protein signal on at least one array probed with HAMLET and less than 1
standard deviation above for the control array, the Z-factor was greater than 0.5 for the
corresponding array (indicating a signal 2-fold above the noise), the replicate spot CV was
less than 50 % on the corresponding array and the inter-assay CV for the protein was less
than 50 % on the corresponding arrays. For the HAMLET far-Western dot blot 0.5 μg
human recombinant His-tagged HK1 and PKM2 (Abcam), rabbit muscle GPI and BSA
(Sigma-Aldrich) were spotted onto PVDF membranes and blocked with Sat-1 and Sat-2
(Duringer et al 2003). Next, membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with goat anti-αlactalbumin antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories) and 2 hours at room temperature with HRPconjugated rabbit anti-goat antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). To quantify protein binding, dot
intensity was measured with ImageJ software (Abramoff et al., 2004).
Glycolytic enzyme and lactate assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To measure glycolytic enzyme activities, cells were treated with HAMLET, scraped into
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and homogenized by sonication. PK activity was measured as
NADH consumption in a continuous spectrophotometric assay coupled to lactate
dehydrogenase. HK and GPI activities were measured as NADPH formation in continuous
spectrophotometric assays coupled to Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Consumption of
NADH and formation of NADPH was measured by the change in absorbance at 340 nm. All
enzymes and reagents were from Sigma. For the lactate assay, cells were treated with
HAMLET in medium without added sodium pyruvate, the medium was collected and lactate
levels measured with the Lactate Assay kit (Biovision).
Metabolomics
HAMLET-treated cells were pelleted, snap frozen in dry ice-chilled acetone and stored at
−80°C. Chemicals were from Sigma or Honeywell (Morristown) and were of the highest
purity. For metabolite extraction, samples were resuspended in PBS, lysed and extracted
with methanol and a second time with isopropanol. LC-MS reverse phase chromatography
was performed on a Zorbax C18 column with 5 μm particles at a flow rate of 20 μl/minute.
Chromatography was performed as follows: equilibration in 3 % buffer B for 3 minutes,

3-50 % buffer B gradient over 5 minutes, 50-99 % buffer B gradient over 25 minutes, 99 %
buffer B for 10 minutes, wash with a solution of acetone and isopropanol (1:1) for 10
minutes and re-equilibration in 3 % buffer B for 10 minutes. Data was collected using an
Agilent ESIQTOF and a capillary voltage of 4000 V. Custom software written in the Matlab
programming language was used to define features within each sample and compare them
across samples (Smith et al., 2006). Signal intensities of quadruplicate samples were
averaged and features with an abs. log2 fold change ≥ 1 and p ≤ 0.05 (Wilcoxon rank sum
test) were considered to be significantly altered.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For GC-MS analysis, HAMLET-treated cells were washed with PBS followed by the
addition of 650 μl of ice-cold methanol per well to stop metabolic activity. Subsequently,
cells were scraped into the solvent and transferred to a reaction tube. 6 replicates consisting
of 3 pooled wells each were collected per sample group. For extraction, the methanol phase
was removed from the cells, dried and stored at −80°C. Cell pellets were dried in a FreeZone
2.5 lyophilizer (Labconco, Kansas City, MO), homogenized using a Mini-Beadbeater
(BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) and extracted with 700 μl of a pre-cooled methanolisopropanol-water (3:3:2) mixture. The extract was then combined with the dried methanol
phase from the previous step, dried again and stored at −80°C. A mixture of fatty acid
methyl esters (C8, C9, C10, C12, C14, C16, C18, C20, C22, C24, C26, C28 and C30 linear
chain length) was added as internal retention index markers. A solution of methoxyamine
hydrochloride (40 mg/ml of 98% pure, Sigma) in pyridine (silylation grade, Pierce) was
added and samples incubated at 30°C for 90 min to protect aldehyde and ketone groups.
After that 1% TMSC (Pierce) in MSTFA was added and samples were incubated at 37°C for
30 min for trimethylsilylation of acidic protons. A Gerstel automatic liner exchange system
with multipurpose sample MPS2 dual rail was used to inject 0.5 μl sample to a Gerstel CIS
cold injection system (Gerstel). Injected samples were separated using an Agilent 6890 gas
chromatograph, equipped with a 30 m long, 0.25 mm i.d. Rtx5Sil-MS column (Restek, 0.25
μm 5% diphenyl film and additional 10 m integrated guard column). Mass spectrometry was
performed on a Leco Pegasus IV time of flight mass spectrometer (St. Joseph, MI) with
280°C transfer line temperature, −70 eV electron ionization and an ion source temperature
of 250°C. Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 85 to 500 at 17 spectra/s and 1850 V
detector voltage. Result files were processed using the metabolomics BinBase database
(Fiehn et al 2005). All database entries in BinBase were matched against the Fiehn mass
spectral library of ~1200 authentic metabolite spectra using retention index and mass
spectrum information or the NIST05 commercial library (http://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/
Metabolite-Library-2007/). Identified metabolites were included if present within at least
50% of the samples of each treatment group (as defined in the SetupX database (Scholz and
Fiehn 2007).

Figure 1. A shRNA barcode screen identifies c-Myc and metabolic proteins as determinants of
HAMLET sensitivity

A Workflow of the shRNA screen. A549 cells were infected with a library of barcoded
shRNAs targeting 1650 cancer-related genes. After 2 hours of HAMLET exposure, barcodes
were recovered, amplified and labeled with Cy3/Cy5 and the relative abundance of each
shRNA was measured by microarrays. B A small number of hairpins were enriched, as seen
in the MA-plot of shRNAs in control samples (Cy3) vs. HAMLET (35 μM) samples (Cy5).
The fold change is shown on the x-axis (log2 (Cy5/Cy3) and the XXX is shown on the y-

axis (log2 (√intensity Cy3 x intensity Cy5)). C-D shRNAs targeting HK1 and the
metabolism-regulating genes PFKFB1, HIF1A and c-Myc significantly modify HAMLET
sensitivity. The diagram shows the highest scores observed for each gene. E-F The gene list
containing all positive hits from the shRNA screen was subjected to Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis using the canonical pathway collection to identify common pathways targeted by
the positive shRNAs. The Ras pathway, together with glycolysis-related pathways, had the
highest normalized enrichment scores (NES).

Figure 2. c-Myc modifies sensitivity to HAMLET-induced cell death

A Healthy kidney cells (HRPTEC), kidney carcinoma cells (A498) and lung carcinoma cells
(A549) were treated with HAMLET (21 μM) and ATP levels were measured after 3, 6 and
24 hours. HAMLET caused a reduction in ATP levels in the carcinoma cells but not in the
healthy cells. ATP levels are given in % of untreated cells at the same time point. Means of
3 experiments + SEMs. B qPCR quantification of c-Myc mRNA levels. Relative c-Myc
mRNA levels are shown (c-Myc/GAPDH, in % of levels in healthy cells). Means of 2

Figure 3. Glucose deprivation and glycolysis inhibition enhances HAMLET-induced cell death

Glucose (G) deprivation and the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) enhance the
lethal effect of HAMLET while glucose (0.5, 2.5, 5.0 mM) rescues the cells in a dosedependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of HAMLET was quantified by measuring ATP
levels or by Trypan blue (TB) exclusion and changes in morphology were recorded by
confocal microscopy. A Glucose deprivation or 2DG (2.5 mM) increased the cytotoxic
effect of HAMLET (HL, 21 μM) in A549 cells. ATP levels are given in % of levels in
untreated cells in 2.5 mM glucose. Means of 2-4 experiments + SEMs (1 hour) * for p ≤

Figure 4. HAMLET binds to HK 1

A In a protein array containing 8000 proteins, HAMLET bound to HK1 in a dose-dependent
manner (5 or 50 ng/μl) but not to PKM2 or other glycolytic enzymes. B In a far-Western dot
blot, HAMLET bound strongly to human HK1 but not to the other three proteins.
Recombinant human His-tagged HK1 and PKM2, rabbit muscle GPI and BSA were spotted
onto PVDF membranes and incubated with HAMLET (HL) or α-lactalbumin (ALA) (both
0.2 mg/ml) or buffer as control. Bound HAMLET or α-lactalbumin was detected using goat
anti-α-lactalbumin and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibodies and quantified using
