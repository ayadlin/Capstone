ABSTRACT
Recent clinical trials have demonstrated targeting PI3K pathway is a promising
strategy for the treatment of blood cancers. To identify novel PI3K inhibitors, we
performed a high throughput virtual screen and identified several novel small molecule
compounds, including PIK-C98 (C98). The cell-free enzymatic studies showed that C98
inhibited all class I PI3Ks at nano- or low micromolar concentrations but had no effects
on AKT or mTOR activity. Molecular docking analysis revealed that C98 interfered with
the ATP-binding pockets of PI3Ks by forming H-bonds and arene-H interactions with
specific amino acid residues. The cellular assays demonstrated that C98 specifically
inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, but had no effects on other kinases and
proteins including IGF-1R, ERK, p38, c-Src, PTEN, and STAT3. Inhibition of PI3K by
C98 led to myeloma cell apoptosis. Furthermore, oral administration of C98 delayed
tumor growth in two independent human myeloma xenograft models in nude mice
but did not show overt toxicity. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that C98 was well
penetrated into myeloma tumors. Therefore, through a high throughput virtual screen
we identified a novel PI3K inhibitor that is orally active against multiple myeloma
with great potential for further development.

10,710 MM-related deaths in USA in 2013 [2]. Therefore,
novel treatments are urgently demanded.
In recent years, substantial efforts have been made
to identify optimal targets for MM treatment, and the
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling
pathway comes to attention. PI3Ks are a group of lipid
kinases, of which Class I including p110α, p110β,
p110δ, and p110γ is involved in carcinogenesis and
chemoresistance of multiple cancers [3–6]. Dysregulated
PI3K signaling pathway is a frequent event in MM,
including (1) increased insulin-like growth factor 1 (­ IGF-1)

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a kind of plasma
cell malignancy that accounts for more than 10% of all
hematologic cancers and 2% of cancer-related death
[1]. The past decade has witnessed several novel drugs
including the proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib and
calfizomib) and the immunomodulators (thalidomide and
its analogs) for MM treatment, however, the death rate
remains high. American Cancer Society estimates that
there are approximately 22,350 new cases of MM and

and interleukin-6, both of which promote MM cell
proliferation and survival [7, 8]; (2) silenced phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN) that antagonizes the PI3K/
AKT signaling [9]; (3) overactivated PI3K/AKT [10].
Dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
contributes to MM pathophysiology, chemoresistance
and poor prognosis, while interference with this pathway
results in MM cell death [10].
Currently dozens of inhibitors of PI3K and AKT
are under development and some have been successfully
moved to clinical trials for the treatment of various
hematological malignancies, including leukemia and
MM [10, 11]. The phase II clinical trials showed that
as a single agent, idelalisib, an inhibitor of PI3Kδ,
reached a total 57% of response rate in relapsed indolent
lymphoma and 72% of overall complete rate in relapsed
chronic lymphocytic leukemia [12, 13]. These studies
have significantly accelerated the marketing of idelalisib
for the treatment of refractory leukemia and lymphoma
which was approved by Food and Drug Administration
of USA on July 23, 2014. Therefore, targeting PI3K is
emerging as a high promise for the treatment of these
diseases.
In the present study, we took advantage of the
advancement of PI3K crystal structure, molecular docking,
and combinatorial chemistry, and performed a high
throughput virtual screen against 800,000 small molecule
compounds using PI3Kγ as the subject and identified a
promising PI3K inhibitor with a novel scaffold for MM
treatment.

respectively. To further evaluate its specificity on PI3K, the
effects of C98 on other associated kinases AKT, PDK1, and
mTOR were also measured in the enzymatic systems. The
results showed that C98 displayed minimal inhibitory effects
on AKT activation (IC50 = 61.4 μM) but failed to suppress
PDK1 and mTOR activity even at a concentration of
300 μM. Therefore, C98 preferred to inhibit PI3K activity.

C98 specifically inhibits the PI3K signaling
pathway
Subsequently, the inhibition of C98 on the PI3K
signaling pathway was evaluated in MM cell lines OPM2
and JJN3. Immunoblotting analyses revealed that C98
downregulated the phosphorylation levels of AKT, mTOR,
p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 (Figure 2A). Because all these
kinases are downstream signaling proteins in the PI3K
pathway while C98 had no effects on AKT and mTOR in
the cell free assay, the inhibition of C98 on these kinases
was probably due to its suppression on PI3K.
To find out whether C98 also interfered with other
signaling pathways, we first checked the receptor tyrosine
kinase IGF-1R, which mediates PI3K activation in MM
cells in the presence of IGF-1. Starved MM cells LP1 and
JJN3 were incubated with C98 followed by IGF-1
stimulation. Immunoblotting assays revealed that IGF-1
induced phosphorylation of both IGF-1R and AKT
(Figure 2B), and C98 suppressed AKT phosphorylation
but had no effects on IGF-1R activation at a concentration
of 100 μM (Figure 2B). This result suggested that C98
inhibited PI3K independent of IGF-1R activation.
Moreover, we also measured the expression of PTEN, a
negative regulator of PI3K signaling, in MM cells after
C98 treatment. The immunoblotting analysis showed that
C98 had no effects on the PTEN protein level (Figure 2B).
To further clarify the effects of C98 on other
signaling pathways associated with PI3K signaling,
we evaluated ERK and p38, both of which mediate
extracellular signaling similar to PI3K. As shown in Figure
2C, C98 failed to decrease the phosphorylation levels of
both ERK and p38. Moreover, C98 failed to inhibit the
phosphorylation of c-Src, a non-receptor kinase (Figure
2C). We also checked the phosphorylation status of
STAT3, a signal transducer and activator of transcription.
C98 did not decrease phosphorylated STAT3 (Figure 2C).
Therefore, C98 had no effects on these kinases/proteins
associated with PI3K signaling. These results suggested
that PI3K was the target of C98.

RESULTS
C98 potently inhibits PI3K activity
Six novel compounds which were identified
as potential PI3K inhibitors of which C96 has been
demonstrated to induce MM cell death by targeting the PI3K
signaling [16]. To determine whether C98 was able to inhibit
PI3K activity, a MM cell line OPM2 which displays high
PI3K activity due to lack of PTEN, a negative modulator
of the PI3K signaling pathway [16], was starved overnight
followed by C98 treatment and subsequent stimulation with
IGF-1, a critical trigger of PI3K signaling and a key growth
factor in MM cell proliferation. Immunoblotting analysis
revealed that C98 potently inhibited PI3K activity. As
shown in Figure 1B, C98 suppressed AKT phosphorylation
in a manner similar to a proven PI3K inhibitor S14161 [15].
More importantly, C98 inhibited AKT phosphorylation
in a time- and concentration- dependent manner in OPM2
cells (Figures 1C and 1D). To confirm this hypothesis, the
inhibitory potency of C98 on PI3K enzymes was measured
in a cell-free system with individual recombinant human
PI3K isoforms [15]. The results revealed that C98 inhibited
all Class I isoforms (Figure 1E). The IC50 values against
α, β, δ, and γ isoforms were 0.59, 1.64, 3.65, and 0.74 μM,

Modeling of C98 interactions with PI3K isoforms
We next analyzed the interaction of C98 with
PI3K isoforms by computer modeling. It showed that the
binding geometries of C98 in the ATP pockets of PI3K
isoforms were quite similar. For example, the amino group
of C98 could form H-bonds with the specific residues

of each isoform: Ser854 of α (Figure 3A), Val848 of β
(Figure 3B), Ser831 of δ (Figure 3C), and Ala885 of γ
(Figure 3D). In addition, the nitrile group of C98 as an
H-bond acceptor could form an H-bond with Trp781 of
PI3Kβ (Figure 3B). All these H-bonds played a key role
in the interaction between C98 and PI3Ks because the
H-bonds acted as a gate to prevent C98 from escaping
from the binding sites [25].
To further recognize the dynamic interaction
patterns between C98 and PI3Ks, MD simulations and
free energy decomposition analyses were employed.
As illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1, in addition
to the H-bonds (Figure 3), the arene-H interactions
were also formed between C98 and specific residues in
each isoform, including Tyr836/Ile848/Val850/Ile932
of PI3Kα (Supplementary Figure S1A), and Ile930 of
PI3Kβ (Supplementary Figure S1B), Tyr813/Ile910
of PI3Kδ (Supplementary Figure S1C), and Tyr867 of
PI3Kγ (Supplementary Figure S1D). Moreover, the
p-chlorophenylmoiety and the furan ring of C98 also
formed van der Waals interactions with PI3K isoforms
(Supplementary Figure S2). All these lipophilic
interactions between the benzene and furan rings and the
cavity lined by hydrophobic residues Ile848/Ile932 of
PI3Kα, Ile845/Ile930 of PI3Kβ, Ile825/Ile910 of PI3Kδ,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or Ile879/Ile963 of PI3Kγ were important to stabilize the
interaction between C98 and PI3K isoforms [26].

C98 induces apoptosis of MM cells in
associationwith its PI3K inhibition
The above studies have demonstrated that C98 was
a specific inhibitor of Class I PI3Ks, to find out whether
this compound could induce MM cell apoptosis by
targeting PI3K, JJN3 cells were treated with C98 with
increased duration or concentrations. As shown in Figure
4A, C98 inhibited AKT phosphorylation and activated
caspase-3 in a time- and concentration-dependent
manner. To be noted, AKT inhibition occurred earlier
or at a lower concentration than caspase-3 cleavage,
suggesting that C98-induced MM cell apoptosis was
associated with AKT inactivation or PI3K inhibition.
To answer whether C98 could induce apoptosis in
other MM cells, 5 more MM cells were subject to the
study. As shown in Figure 4B, all cell lines examined
were triggered to apoptosis because both caspase-3 and
PARP were cleaved. Cell apoptosis induced by C98 was
further confirmed by the increased fraction of positive
cells stained with Annexin V (Figure 5) [27]. To show
whether activated PI3K signals can rescue C98 effects on

with IGF-1 alone or together with C98 for 48 hr followed

AKT signaling pathway.

experiment was further confirmed in another xenograft
model generated with JJN3, a dexamethasone-resistant
MM cell line [28]. In this model, mice were randomly
divided into three groups and received vehicle, 40, and
80 mg/kg of C98, respectively. C98 at 80 mg/kg decreased
tumor growth to 76.5% (from 2469.4 ± 174.6 mm3
decreased to 581.2 ± 73.2 mm3) in 16 days (Figure 6B).
Notably, C98 at 40 mg/kg also markedly delayed tumor
growth (from 2469.4 ± 174.6 mm3 decreased to 1293.1 ±
289.7 mm3, or 48% decrease) (Figure 6B). The tumor
weight was consistent with the dynamic tumor growth
analysis (Figure 6C). However, C98 had no effects on
body weight of mice in neither models (Supplementary
Figure S4). There were no significant changes in blood
cell count, platelet count, or hemoglobin measurement in
mice treated with C98 (Data not shown).
To evaluate whether C98 delayed MM tumor
growth was associated with PI3K inhibition, we
measured AKT phosphorylation levels in tumors

C98 is an orally available PI3K inhibitor with
robust anti-myeloma activity
To further evaluate the in vivo anti-myeloma activity
of C98, two independent MM xenograft models in nude
mice were established with two human MM cell lines,
OPM2 and JJN3, followed by oral administration of C98.
We first evaluated the therapeutic effects of C98 on OPM2
using 80 mg/kg, a dose less than 1/10 of the oral LD50 for
mice. In the 16-day treatment, tumors were decreased to
45% of the vehicle control (1328.3 ± 82.5 v.s. 605.8 ±

DISCUSSION

developed from JJN3 after C98 treatment. As shown
in Figure 6D, AKT phosphorylation was decreased by
C98 at both 40 and 80 mg/kg doses, while total AKT
and PTEN were not markedly affected. Notably, cleavage
of PARP was found in the MM tumors excised from
C98-treated mice, especially in the high dose group
(Figure 6D). We also measured the concentration of C98
in the tumors at the end of the experiment by LC-MS/
MS. It showed that the average concentration of C98 in
tumor tissues in the 80 mg/kg-treated group was 622.4 ±
374.8 ng/g, which suggested that C98 penetrated into the
tumor tissues.

PI3K inhibitors have been identified by several
strategies including structure-activity relationship directed
design [29], gene-based high throughput screening
[15], affinity selection coupled mass spectrometry
screening [30], high content screening [31] and virtual
screening [32]. Among these strategies, except for VS,
all other methods require most advanced techniques and
equipments, such as robotic facility, high resolution of
fluorescent microscopes, and mass spectrometers, which
are very cost and time-consuming. In contrast, by taking
advantage of the in-depth understanding of the crystal
structure, the molecular mechanism of known PI3K
inhibitors, the advancement of molecular docking, and
the availability of the large small chemicals libraries,
VS is therefore regarded as a reliable, cost-effective and­
time-saving method to identify PI3K inhibitors [33, 34].
By using the Glide HTVS coupled SP-XP mode, C98 was
identify as a specific inhibition of PI3K enzymes.
Molecular docking and MD stimulations confirmed
that the H-bonds and van de Waals contacts are important for
the interference of C98 with the ATP active pocket of PI3Ks.
These interactions established between specific groups
of C98 and conserved hydrophobic residues of the ATPbinding cleft may account for its potency against PI3K and
selectivity profile over protein kinases. C98 interacts with

The pharmacokinetic analysis of C98
To further characterize C98 in the treatment of
MM, we determined its pharmacokinetic parameters.
One bolus of 40 mg/kg of C98 was orally administrated,
blood samples were then collected at the time points of
0.167, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hr. LC-MS/MS determined
the concentration of C98 in the plasma, and found that
C98 was detected in the plasma at 10 min. The median
peak concentration (Cmax) was 367.0 ng/mL, the time to
maximal concentration (Tmax) was 0.5 hr, the half-life
(t1/2) was 2.03 hr, and the mean residence time (MRT) was
4.48 hr (Supplementary Figure S5). These data showed
that C98 could be rapidly absorbed.

into nude mice with a density of 10 million cells/site/mouse. When tumors were palpable, mice (n = 5/group) were orally given C98
(80 mg/kg to OPM2 mice, 40 and 80 mg/kg to JJN3 mice) in PBS containing 10% Tween 80 and 10% DMSO daily for continuous

and inhibits PI3Kα, β, δ, and γ isoforms probably because
these PI3Ks share conserved domains especially in the active
pockets. This is supported by the enzyme reaction assays
which showed that C98 inhibits human PI3Kα, β, δ, and γ at
nanomolar or low micromolar concentrations but does not
suppress PDK1 or mTOR activity. Inhibition of PI3K is also
demonstrated by the cell-based assays because C98 treatment
entailed a decrease of AKT phosphorylation. Consistent with
abrogation of AKT function, C98 decreases phosphorylation
of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 proteins, two signature substrates
in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. However, C98
does not show markedly suppression on other associated
pathway signals such as IGF-1, ERK, p38, c-Src, and
STAT3. Therefore, all these selected inhibition on PI3K
suggests C98 is a preferred inhibitor of the PI3K isoforms.
C98 displays robust activity against the PI3K/AKT
signals which is critical for cell proliferation and cell
survival, therefore C98 treatment led to growth inhibition
and apoptosis of multiple MM cell lines. PTEN is a negative
modulator of the PI3K signaling, thus the PTEN expression
level sometimes plays a key role in the treatment with PI3K
inhibitors [35, 36]. In this study, C98 induces apoptosis
in both PTEN-deleting and PTEN-expressing cells,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggesting C98 is independent of PTEN expression status.
This inhibition was also found in the in vivo study because
C98 delays MM tumor growth in both PTEN-deleting and
PTEN-expressing xenograft models. The phosphorylation
level of AKT is correlated with the decrease of tumor
volumes and weight. Therefore, the anti-MM activity of
C98 is highly associated with its suppression on the PI3K
signaling pathway.
The pharmacokinetics analysis on C98 in vivo
showed C98 is probably rapidly absorbed and distributed
because the Tmax is 0.5 hr and the t1/2 is around 2 hr.
Although we did not measured the concentration in other
tissues and organs, C98 was found in the MM tumor
tissues with an average concentration up to 622.6 ng/g,
suggesting that C98 can penetrate into the tumor tissues
where it exerts its anti-myeloma activity. It also suggests
C98 has a reliable oral activity. However, to be noted is
that C98 is rapidly absorbed and its half-life is relatively
short. Therefore, its structure should be optimized to
increase its circulation time and to improve its efficacy.
In conclusion, a high throughput VS-based screen
identified a novel PI3K-specific inhibitor, which was
confirmed by a series of biochemical, cellular and animal

PI3Kβ: 2Y3A; PI3Kδ: 4AJW; PI3Kγ: 3APC) (http://www.
pdb.org/pdb/). Before the MD simulations, the structure
of C98 in complex with each PI3K isoform predicted
by molecular docking was subjected to minimization.
After that, each complex was gradually heated from 0
to 300 K over a period of 50 ps. Then, 5 ns NPT MD
simulations were performed with a target temperature of
300 K and a target pressure of 1 atm. All bonds involved
in hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE
algorithm, [20] and the time step was set to 2.0 fs.
Coordinates were saved every 10 ps for the subsequent
analyses. The interactions between each residue in PI3Ks
and C98 were characterized using the MM/GBSA free
energy decomposition analysis in AMBER11 as reported
previously [19, 21].

Signaling Technologies (Devers, MA). Antibodies against
β-actin and GAPDH were obtained from Abgent (Suzhou,
China). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugate anti-mouse or
anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from
Beyotime (Nantong, China). All MM cell lines and cell
culture were described previously [14, 15].

Cell viability and apoptosis assays
Cell viability was assessed with the MTT assay as
reported previously [22]. To show apoptosis, MM cells
were incubated for 24 hr with increasing concentrations
of C98 before being stained with Annexin V-FITC
and propidium iodide (BioVision Milpitas, CA).
Apoptotic cells were measured on a flow cytometer
(FACSCalibur®, Becton Dickinson) as reported as
previously [23].

Structure-based high throughput
virtual screening
The high throughput virtual screen was described
previously [16]. Briefly, 200,000 compounds from Specs
(Delft, The Netherlands) and 600,000 compounds from
ChemBridge (San Diego, CA) were docked into the active
site of PI3Kγ (3APC) from the RCSB Protein Data Bank
[17] and scored using three different scoring modes: high
throughput virtual screening (HTVS), standard precision
(SP) and extra precision (XP) [16]. Firstly, the top 50%
of the structures were saved after the HTVS screening;
secondly, these saved structures were redocked and scored
by using the Glide SP mode, and the resultant top 30% of
structures were re-docked and scored by using the Glide
XP mode. After the XP docking, the top 1,500 compounds
ranked by the Glide XP scoring after being filtered by the
Lipinski’s Rule-of-Five employed in MOE were clustered
into 150 clusters based on the Tanimoto distance computed
from the FCFP_4 fingerprints by using the Selector
Module in SYBYL 8.1 [18]. From this screen, several
potent compounds including C96 [16] and PIK-C98 (C98)
(Figure 1A) were identified for further studies.

Kinase activity in cell-free assay
Kinase activity in the presence of C98 was
performed by using the HotSpot technology (Reaction
Biology Corp., Malvern, PA, USA) as described
previously [15].

Immunoblotting
The immunoblotting assays were performed as
described previously [14]. IRDye 680 goat anti-mouse
and IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from
Odyssey (San Ramon, CA, USA).

Pharmacokinetic study
Prior to dose administration, nude mice (Shanghai
Slac Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) were
fasted overnight with free access to water in the regular
light-dark cycle. A group of 9 mice received an oral dose
of C98 at 40 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected from
three mice (n = 3) at each time points as follows: 0.167,
0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hr. Blood samples (100 μL) were
immediately mixed with 10 μL of EDTA and plasma was
obtained by centrifugation at 1.3 × 104 rpm for 10 min.
Samples were stored at –80°C for LC-MS/MS analysis.

LC-MS/MS analysis

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Concentrations of C98 in plasma and in tumor
tissues were analyzed by a LC-MS/MS method as
described previously [24]. Chromatographic separation
was achieved using an Agela Venusil XBP C18 column
(50 × 2.1 mm; 5 mm particle size, Bonna-Agela
Technologies, Tianjin, China). The column temperature
was maintained at 40°C. Gradient elution at a flow rate of
0.3 mL/min was performed using the mobile phases: A,
acetonitrile: water: formic acid (5: 95: 0.1, v: v: v) and
B, acetonitrile: water: formic acid (95: 5: 0.1, v: v: v).
The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative
ionization mode. The ion transitions for the multiple
reaction monitored were: C98, 346.6 (M-H)→312.7;
betamethasone (internal standard, IS), 391.1 (M-H)→
361.4 , with a dwell time of 100 ms per transition. After
setting the collision energy and mass transition for C98
and the Internal standard, all other parameters were
optimized for the best sensitivity. Data was processed by
the Analyst 1.5.2 data collection and integration software
(AB Sciex, Framingham, MA).

Myeloma xenograft in nude mice
Totally 50 female SCID in mice from Shanghai Slac
Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd were used for the xenograft
models with human MM cell lines OPM2 and JJN3,
respectively. When tumors were palpable, the OPM2xenograft mice were randomly divided into two groups.
One group as a control was received the vehicle [15], and
another group was orally administrated C98 (80 mg/kg) once
a day for continuous 16 days. The JJN3 xenografted mice
were randomly divided into three groups which were orally
administrated vehicle or C98 (40 or 80 mg/kg), respectively.
Body weight and tumor volumes were measured every
other day as described previously [15]. At the end of this
experiment, tumors were collected for further studies. The
concentrations of C98 in tumor tissues were also determined
by LC-MS/MS as described above. All experiments involved
in mice were reviewed and approved by the Review Board
of Animal Care and Use of Soochow University.
