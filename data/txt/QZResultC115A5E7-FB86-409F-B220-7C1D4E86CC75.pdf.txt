ABSTRACT
Nogo-B receptor (NgBR), a type I single transmembrane domain receptor is
the specific receptor for Nogo-B. Our previous work demonstrated that NgBR is
highly expressed in breast cancer cells, where it promotes epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT), an important step in metastasis. Here, we show that both in vitro and
in vivo increased expression of NgBR contributes to the increased chemoresistance of
Bel7402/5FU cells, a stable 5-FU (5-Fluorouracil) resistant cell line related Bel7402
cells. NgBR knockdown abrogates S-phase arrest in Bel7402/5FU cells, which
correlates with a reduction in G1/S phase checkpoint proteins p53 and p21. In addition,
NgBR suppresses p53 protein levels through activation of the PI3K/Akt/MDM2
pathway, which promotes p53 degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway
and thus increases the resistance of human hepatocellular cancer cells to 5-FU.
Furthermore, we found that NgBR expression is associated with a poor prognosis of
human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. These results suggest that targeting
NgBR in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, such as 5-FU, could improve the
efficacy of current anticancer treatments.

INTRODUCTION

ablation are applicable for the 30% of patients whose tumors
or liver function meet defined criteria [4]. Patients with
advanced HCC or liver disease are not suitable for these
curative interventions and require systemic chemotherapy
[5]. However, these patients frequently develop drug
resistance causing their treatments to fail [6, 7].

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second
leading cause of cancer-related death and the fifth
most common malignancy worldwide [1–3]. Curative
interventions such as transplantation, resection, and thermal

The mechanisms underlying cancer cell
chemoresistance are complex and numerous [8–10],
including increased drug efflux, reduction in drug
absorption, changes of anticancer drugs’ targets, decreased
drug activity, tumor hypoxia, enhancement of DNA repair
following damage, abrogation of apoptotic effector
pathways by altered gene expression, and changes in
signaling pathways. One of the most important causes of
resistance is increased expression of the drug transporter
family known as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters. The most common member of this family is
the ABCB1 (also known as MDR1 (multidrug resistance
gene 1) which encodes for P-glycoprotein. Overexpression
of P-glycoprotein is associated with lower accumulation
of doxorubicin in HCC cells and with worse prognosis in
patients [10]. EMT is also an important process by which
HCC acquire 5-FU chemoresistance [11]. Furthermore,
the activation of an Oct4-AKT-ABCG2 pathway has been
identified to enhance drug resistance in HCC [12, 13].
A comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of
chemoresistance in HCC could present opportunities to
improve the response to cytotoxic agents and improve
clinical outcomes.
The Nogo isoforms-A, -B and -C are members of
the reticulon family of proteins. Nogo-A and Nogo-C
are highly expressed in the central nervous system
(CNS), while Nogo-B is found in most tissues [14, 15].
Nogo-B was previously identified as highly expressed in
caveolin-1 enriched microdomains of endothelial cells
(EC) [16]. The amino terminus (residues1–200) of Nogo-B
(AmNogo-B) serves as a chemoattractant for EC [16].
NgBR was identified as a receptor specific for AmNogo-B
by an expression cloning approach [15, 17]. We have
previously demonstrated that NgBR is necessary for
in vivo angiogenesis in zebrafish via the Akt pathway [18]
and NgBR is highly expressed in human breast invasive
ductal carcinoma [19]. NgBR breast tumor cell expression
is highly correlated with expression of estrogen receptor
and survivin [19]. Further study showed that NgBR
promotes EMT in breast tumor cells, [20] but any role of
NgBR in cancer drug resistance is still unclear. Here, we
show that NgBR depletion sensitizes the 5-FU-resistant
Bel7402/5FU cells to 5-FU treatment via disruption of the
PI3K/Akt/MDM2 signaling pathway and stabilization of
p53 protein. Our results suggest that NgBR is a potential
novel drug target that can be used to increase the efficacy
of conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

with the indicated concentrations of 5-FU, and cell
proliferation and survival were assessed using clonogenic
survival assays. As shown in Figure 1A, compared with
the Bel7402 control cells, the Bel/5FU cells were resistant
to 5-FU. Then, the mRNA and protein levels of NgBR
were evaluated in both cell lines. As shown in Figure 1B
and 1C, both the NgBR mRNA and protein levels
were increased in the Bel/5FU cell lines. These results
indicate that higher NgBR expression is associated with
chemoresistance in human HCC cell lines.

NgBR knockdown decreases the chemoresistance
of Bel/5FU cells in vitro
To determine whether knockdown of NgBR could
decrease the chemoresistance of Bel/5FU cells, NgBR
siRNA was used to silence the expression of NgBR. The
efficiency of transfection was evaluated by real-time
RT-PCR and western blot. The results demonstrate that all
three NgBR siRNAs (S1, S2, and S3) effectively reduce
the mRNA and protein levels of NgBR(Supplementary
Figure S1A and S1B). Clonogenic survival assay showed
knockdown of NgBR by all three siRNAs (S1, S2, and S3)
reduces colony formation of Bel/5FU cells in response to
5-FU treatment (Supplementary Figure S1C). We used S1
for the following NgBR siRNA knockdown experiment.
Clonogenic assay further showed that knockdown of
NgBR by siRNA reduces the colony number in response to
5-FU treatment in a dose dependent manner (Figure 2A).
In addition, CCK-8 assay results also revealed knockdown
of NgBR decreases the cell survival rate of Bel/5FU cells
at all 5-FU treatment time points (Figure 2B). These
results indicate that NgBR knockdown decreases the
chemoresistance of Bel/5FU cells.
To confirm that apoptosis contributes to the
inhibitory effects of NgBR knockdown on Bel/5FU cell
chemoresistance, we used Annexin V-FITC/ propidium
iodide (PI) staining-based fluorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis to examine cell apoptosis.
Knockdown of NgBR did not increase apoptosis of
Bel/5FU cells, and 5-FU treatment alone did not increase
apoptosis of the Bel/5FU control cell (non-specific siRNA
or NS) either (Figure 2C). However, 5-FU increased
apoptosis of Bel/5FU NgBR knockdown cells (siNgBR).
AO/EB staining incorporation assay indicates that NgBR
knockdown decreased the chemoresistance of the Bel/5FU
cell by increasing 5-FU induced HCC cell apoptosis
(Supplementary Figure S2).

RESULTS
NgBR expression is increased in the drug
resistant human HCC cells

NgBR knockdown induces the abrogation of
S-phase arrest of Bel/5FU cells by increasing p53
protein level

To confirm the 5-FU chemoresistance phenotype
in Bel/5FU cells, the HCC parental cells (Bel7402) and
the chemoresistant HCC cells (Bel/5FU) were treated

Cell-cycle dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer
cells. Cell-cycle checkpoint protein dysfunction can alter

[21]. To explore whether the chemoresistance of Bel/5FU
cells is caused by cell cycle change, we examined the
percentages of cell cycle distribution by PI staining-based
FACS analysis. The results (Figure 3A) show that more
Bel/5FU cells undergo S-phase arrest compared with
the Bel7402 cells. Interestingly, knockdown of NgBR
abrogated the S phase arrest in Bel/5FU cells (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, by restoring NgBR expression by
transfection of pIRES-NgBR, an NgBR-expressing
plasmid, we found that NgBR overexpression rescues the
abrogation of S-phase arrest presented in Bel/5FU NgBR
knockdown cells (Figure 3C). These results suggest that
chemoresistance of Bel/5FU cells may be caused by S
phase arrest, and knockdown of NgBR abrogates this S
phase arrest thus decreasing the chemoresistance of the
Bel/5FU cells.
Given the S phase arrest, p53 protein and
downstream p21 protein are the most important G1/S
phase checkpoint proteins involved [22]. p21 binds to the
CDK6/CyclinD1 complex and blocks the kinase activity
of CDKs [23]. The CDK6/CyclinD1 complex increases
phosphorylated Rb protein level followed by cell entry
into S phase from G1 phase [21]. Therefore, we examined
the p53 and p21 protein level in Bel7402 and Bel/5FU
cells by western blot. As shown in Figure 4A, the p53
protein and downstream protein p21 protein level were
decreased in Bel/5FU cells as compared to the control

Bel7402 cells. Consequently, CDK6 and CyclinD1 protein
expression as well as phosphorylated Rb protein levels
are increased in Bel/5FU cells as compared to the control
Bel7402 cells (Figure 4A). On the contrary, knockdown
of NgBR in Bel/5FU cells increased p53 and p21 protein
levels and consequently decreased CDK6, CyclinD1,
and phosphorylated Rb protein levels as compared to the
control Bel/5FU NS cells (Figure 4B). Furthermore, these
protein level changes in NgBR knockdown Bel/5FU cells
can be rescued by co-transfecting pIRES-NgBR plasmid
DNA and siNgBR together as shown in Figure 4C.
Collectively, these results suggest the altered cell cycle
caused by decreased expression of p53 proteins and
consequent reduction of p53 downstream signal pathway
contributes to the chemoresistance of Bel/5FU cells.
Knockdown of NgBR in Bel/5FU cells restores the p53
protein expression as well as normal cell cycle function
and thus decreases the chemoresistance of Bel/5FU cells.

NgBR promotes the ubiquitination of p53 via
Akt-mediated MDM2 phosphorylation
To further assess the mechanisms by which NgBR
reduces p53 protein level, we investigated whether the
p53 mRNA levels were changed in Bel/5FU cells first.
The results showed that the p53 mRNA levels were not
changed in Bel/5FU cells as compared with Bel7402 cells.

Nor does knockdown of NgBR in Bel/5FU cells change
the p53 mRNA level (Figure 5A). These results indicate
that NgBR does not affect p53 transcript levels.
Previous reports [24, 25] showed that p53 protein
undergoes degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome
pathway. To determine the role of NgBR in regulating
ubiquitination and degradation of p53 proteins in HCC
cells, the degradation dynamics assay was used to detect
the p53 protein level in Bel7402 and Bel/5FU cells.
Cycloheximide(CHX) inhibits new protein translation.
Our results show that the p53 protein diminished in
control Bel/5FU NS cells 30 minutes after CHX treatment.
However, the half-life of the p53 protein was increased
in the NgBR knockdown Bel/5FU cells, and p53 protein
expression was still detected after 2 hours of CHX

treatment (Supplementary Figure S3A). In addition, we
found that p53 protein was decreased in Bel7402 cells
with pIRES-NgBR plasmid overexpression of NgBR
(Figure 5B). However, if we treated the cells with the
proteasome inhibitor MG132, NgBR overexpression does
not change the p53 protein level as compared to Bel7402
cells transfected with control empty vector (Figure 5B).
Furthermore, ubiquitin antibody immunoprecipitation
results show that NgBR knockdown reduces p53
ubiquitination in Bel/5FU cells (Supplementary
Figure S3B). These results suggest that NgBR regulates
p53 protein level by promoting the degradation of p53 via
ubiquitin proteasome pathway.
MDM2, an ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central
role in the regulation of p53 protein stability. Previous

studies have demonstrated Akt mediated phosphorylation
of MDM2, allowing ubiquitination and degradation
of p53 [26–29]. And It has been demonstrated that
phosphorylation of Akt increased the translocation of
MDM2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [30]. Our
previous work has reported that NgBR regulates the Akt
phosphorylation [18, 20]. Therefore, we hypothesized
that NgBR regulates p53 protein stability via the
PI3K/Akt/MDM2 signaling pathway in HCC cells. To
test this hypothesis, we first used western blot analysis to
detect the phosphorylation levels of both Akt and MDM2
in Bel7402 and Bel/5FU cells. The results showed that the
phos-Akt and phos-MDM2 levels in Bel/5FU cells were
higher than in the control Bel7402 cells, while the total Akt
and MDM2 remained unchanged (Figure 5C). Knockdown
of NgBR in Bel/5FU cells by siRNA significantly
decreased the phosphorylation of both Akt and MDM2
levels while the total Akt and MDM2 remained unchanged
(Figure 5D). In addition, NgBR knockdown decreases
the translocation of MDM2 from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus in Bel/5FU cells (Figure 5E). Furthermore,
overexpression of NgBR by co-transfected pIRES-NgBR
plasmid together with siNgBR in Bel/5FU cells can rescue
impaired phosphorylation of both Akt and MDM2 levels
in NgBR knockdown Bel/5FU cells (Figure 5F). While
treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, inhibits
the levels of p-Akt and p-MDM2 in Bel/5FU cells highly
expressing NgBR (Figure 5F). Meanwhile, a clonogenic
survival assay showed that LY294002 also inhibits
the rescue effects of NgBR overexpression in NgBR
knockdown Bel/5FU cells (Figure 5G). Collectively, our
results demonstrate that NgBR inhibits p53 expression by
activating the PI3K/Akt/MDM2 pathway to promote the
degradation of p53 via ubiquitin proteasome pathway and
thus increases the chemoresistance of Bel/5FU cells.

tumors to 5-FU through stabilizing p53 protein levels
in vivo.

NgBR is highly expressed in human HCC patient
tissues and associated with a poor prognosis of
HCC patients
To explore whether NgBR is an important factor
in determining clinical outcomes of HCC patients, we
examined the expression of NgBR in 89 primary HCC
patient tissues and their corresponding adjacent liver tissues
in a tissue microarray by IHC. Positive immunoreactivity
for NgBR was observed primarily in the cell membrane
and cytoplasm (Supplementary Figure S4A).
As shown in Table 1, NgBR was highly expressed in
HCC tissues compared with their corresponding adjacent
liver tissues (P = 0.002). Segregation of patients into
NgBR-positive and NgBR-negative groups did not
reveal NgBR expression significant correlations with
clinical pathological parameters of sex, gender, hepatitis
history, liver cirrhosis, maximal tumor size, tumor
number, vascular invasion, or TNM stage (Table 2).
Furthermore, the overall survival analysis indicated
patients with low NgBR expression owned significantly
higher survival rates compared to the patients with
high NgBR expression (P = 0.017) (Figure 6E). In
addition, multivariate analyses revealed that vascular
invasion and TNM stage, which are the established
prognostic predictors for HCC [31], are independent
prognostic factors for patient survival (Table 3).
Our results indicate that NgBR is an independent
prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.255;
95% confidence interval, 1.209–4.206; P = 0.011) (Table 3).
These results demonstrate that high NgBR expression
is important in tumor progression and serves as an
independent molecular marker for poor HCC prognosis.

Knockdown of NgBR decreases tumor
chemoresistance to 5-FU by increasing p53
protein leves in hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo

DISCUSSION
The development of drug resistance is the major
obstacle in successful and effective chemotherapeutic
treatment of HCC [32]. HCC frequently and easily
acquires chemoresistance. Therefore, conventional
chemotherapy treatments achieve poor efficacy in patients
with advanced HCC and often do not show any benefit
to survival [33]. The mechanism by which HCC acquires
chemoresistance is still not well understood. In this study,
we demonstrate that NgBR expression is upregulated in
HCC cells with acquired chemoresistance and knockdown
of NgBR in the chemoresistant Bel/5FU cells reduces the
chemoresistance in HCC cells. These results indicate that
NgBR could play an important role in the development of
chemoresistance in HCC cells.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is widely used in the treatment
of a variety of tumors. It interferes with nucleoside
metabolism and results in DNA synthesis disorders and

To further examine the in vivo role of NgBR in HCC
chemoresistance to 5-FU treatment, we formed tumor
xenografts by injecting Bel/5FU cells into nude mice. As
shown in Figure 6A–6C, the growth of tumor xenografts
was slower in the NgBR siRNA injected group, and 5-FU
treatment further decreased the tumor size and weight
dramatically in NgBR siRNA injected tumor xenografts.
However, 5-FU treatment alone did not decrease tumor
size or weight in the NS siRNA injected tumor xenografts,
which confirms the chemoresistance of the Bel/5FU
tumor xenografts in vivo. Further analysis of the tumor
samples by IHC (Figure 6D) confirmed that NgBR
reduction by injection of siNgBR significantly stabilized
p53 expression in tumor xenografts. Collectively, our
data strongly suggest that NgBR knockdown reduces the
chemoresistance of human hepatocellular drug-resistant

RNA dysfunction, leading to cytotoxicity [34]. However,
chemotherapeutic drugs that function by inducing DNA
damage frequently fail due to tumors acquiring the ability
to repair the DNA damage and therefore escaping cell
death. Cell cycle dysregulation has been demonstrated
to be involved in the growth inhibition and DNA repair
by DNA-damaging drugs [35]. Alterations in expression
of proteins that control progression through the cell
cycle have been demonstrated to affect chemosensitivity
[36]. Mutated forms of p53 and/or Rb have been shown
to be associated with increased resistance of tumor
cells to various anticancer drugs and irradiation, mainly
because of cell cycle dysregulation [37]. Furthermore,
alterations in other cell cycle regulators such as the cyclins,
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and their inhibitors,
p21Cip1/WAF1 and p27Kip1 , may also play an important role
in the regulation of drug sensitivity [38]. In this study,
we show that chemoresistant Bel/5FU cells undergo
an S-phase arrest not seen in Bel7402 parental cells.
Surprisingly, we found that knockdown of NgBR
abrogates the S-phase arrest in Bel/5FU cells. In addition,
we also clearly demonstrate that altered expression of
these cell cycle regulators is triggered by NgBR, which
is consistent with alterations of the cell cycle distribution.
Therefore, we conclude that targeting NgBR could
partially reverse the drug resistance of Bel/5FU cells by
regulating cell cycle regulators, which results in alterations
of the cell cycle progression.
p53 suppresses cancer progression through the
induction of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence
in response to a variety of cellular stimuli. As we know,
p53 acts as the most important checkpoint protein to
suppress cell growth by inhibiting G1 progression to
S phase while the cell attempts to repair the damage or
to promote apoptosis in cells that fail to repair [39, 40].

Cancer cells harboring wild-type p53 are generally
sensitive to antitumor agents [41]. In contrast, loss of
p53 function in cells, either through mutation or posttranslational modification, might therefore be expected
to lead to unchecked proliferation, tumor growth, and
therapeutic resistance [42, 43]. In addition, a report showed
that p53 gene transfection not only induced suppression of
cell growth, but also increased the sensitivity of Bel/5FU
cells to 5-FU, vincristine, and doxorubicin [32]. In this
study, we found a robust loss of p53 in chemoresistant
HCC cells (Bel/5FU) compared with their corresponding
parental cells (Bel7402). Interestingly, we found that p53
protein levels increased upon knock down of NgBR in
Bel/5FU cells.
Previous studies have demonstrated that Akt
mediates phosphorylation of MDM2 and induces its nuclear
translocation, allowing ubiquitination and degradation
of p53 [26–29]. Our previous work has reported that
NgBR regulates the Akt phosphorylation [18, 20].
In this study, we found that NgBR increases the level of
phos-Akt; phos-Akt then phosphorylates MDM2, and
phos-MDM2 facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation
of p53 proteins. In conclusion, we show that NgBR
facilitates ubiquitination and degradation of p53 proteins
via the PI3K/Akt/MDM2 mediated ubiquitin proteasome
pathway and thus increases the drug resistance of Bel/5FU
cells. The proposed working model showing the roles of
NgBR in regulating the chemoresistance of HCC cells is
shown in Figure 7.
In summary, our results demonstrate that higher
NgBR expression in HCC cells contributes to 5-FU
chemoresistance both in vitro and in vivo. This study
provides compelling evidence in support of targeting
NgBR in combination with 5-FU as a viable option for
improved treatment of drug resistant HCC.

Cell lines and cell culture

Western blot

Human HCC cell lines Bel7402 and 5-FU-selected
drug-resistant Bel7402/5FU (Bel/5FU) were obtained
from KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd (Nanjing, China). The cell
lines were cultured in RPMI Medium 1640 (Gibco, USA)
supplemented with antibiotics(1 × penicillin/streptomycin
100 U/ml, Gibco, USA) and 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco, USA). To maintain the drug-resistant phenotype,
the medium for the Bel/5FU cells was supplemented
with 20 μg/ml 5-FU. Cells were incubated at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

Cells were harvested and lysed in immune
precipitation assay buffer (KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd,
Nanjing, China) supplemented with 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl floride (KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd,
Nanjing, China) and 1 mM phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd) for extracting whole cell
protein samples. For detecting the cellular localization of
total MDM2 and phos-MDM2, nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractions were isolated using the Nuclear and Cytoplasmic
Protein Extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Protein
concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay
kit (KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd). Same amount protein
samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and
then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
(Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY, USA). The
protein band intensities were evaluated using ECL western
blotting kit (Advansta, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and were
normalized to those of β-actin. All experiments were
performed at least three times.

were seeded in 96-well plates at 5000 cells/well. At
24 hours after seeding, cells were transfected with All Star
NS siRNA or NgBR siRNA. Then, after the cells were
treated with 5-FU (50 μg/ml) for 24, 48, or 72 hours, the
medium was exchanged for 100 μl of RPMI-1640 and
10 μl of CCK-8 reagent was added. The cells were
incubated for 3 hours at 37°C. The optical density was
measured using an EnSpireTM 2300 Multilabel Reader
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) at 450 nm. Three
replicates were prepared for each condition.

Cells were seeded in triplicate into a 6-well culture
dish (1000 cells/well). Cells were transfected with NgBR
siRNA and/or NgBR expressing vector pIRES-NgBR. At
24 hours after transfection, cells were treated with 5-FU
and/or Akt inhibitor LY294002 at the indicated doses for
72 hours. Then, the cells were maintained for 2 weeks.
The cell colonies were washed three times with phosphate
buffered saline buffer (PBS), fixed in methanol for 15 minutes,
and stained with Crystal Violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) for 15 minutes at room temperature.

Ubiquitination assays

Apoptosis assay by AO/EB staining

Cells were transfected with indicated siRNA and
cultured for 48 h, and then incubated with 20 μM MG132
for 4 h. Whole-cell lysates were harvested and used for
immunoprecipitation (IP) to detect protein ubiquitination.
The IP experiments were performed with the Pierce Co-IP
Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. 10 μg of the ubiquitin antibody were covalently
coupled with the delivered resin. The antibody-coupled
resin was incubated with 400 μg of the whole-cell protein
lysates overnight at 4°C. The precipitated proteins were
denatured and resolved by 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer.
Ubiquitinated proteins were then detected by anti-p53
antibody.

The cells cultured in 6-well plates were treated
with different concentrations of 5-FU for 48 hours. After
indicated treatment times, the cells were stained with
acridine orange (AO, 200 μg/mL) and ethidium bromide
(EB, 200 μg/mL) for 2 min and then washed with PBS
to remove background staining. After that, cells were
observed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti-S,
Nikon Inc, Japan). The normal cells and early apoptotic
cells can be stained by AO to display bright green
fluorescence, while the late apoptotic cells can be stained
by EB to display orange fluorescence.

Apoptosis measured by annexin V-FITC/
propidium iodide (PI) staining

Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry
analysis

An Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis kit was used to
quantify the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis.
Cells cultured in 6-well plates were treated with 5-FU
(50 μg/mL) for 48 hours. Cells were then harvested and
stained with 5 μL Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL PI in 500 uL
of apoptosis reaction solution at room temperature in
the dark for 30 min. Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Accuri
Cytometers, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was used to detect
apoptotic cells. Cell population in different quadrants was
calculated statistically.

The HCC tissue microarray containing 89 primary
HCC samples and their corresponding adjacent liver
tissues was purchased from Shanghai Outdo Biotech
(Shanghai, China). The overall survival (OS) for the
corresponding patients was calculated from the day
of surgery to the day of death or to the last follow-up.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using a standard
methodology to analyze NgBR protein expression.
Briefly, the tissue microarray (TMA) slides were heated
in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker for 6 min
and incubated with the rabbit polyclonal anti-NgBR
antibody (1:200) overnight at 4˚C. The TMA were then
incubated with goat anti-rabbit Envision System plusHRP (Dako Cytomation) for 30 min at room temperature
and counter stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. The
degrees of immunostaining were reviewed and scored
by two independent pathologists who were blinded to
patient outcome. Cytoplasmic or membranous staining
for NgBR was considered positive [19]. The proportion
of the stained cells and the extent of the staining were
used as criteria of evaluation. For each case, at least
1,000 tumor cells were analyzed and the percentage of
the tumor cells with positively staining was recorded [44].
The percentage of positive cells was assigned a score from
0 (< 5%), 1 (5–25%), 2 (> 25–50%), 3 (> 50–75%), or 4
(> 75%) and the staining intensities within the respective

Cell cycle analysis
The cells were treated with 5-FU at the indicated
concentrations, harvested by trypsinization, and fixed
overnight with 70% cold ethanol at −20˚C. Fixed cells
were stained with the 1 ml 50 μg/ml PI solution containing
0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mg/ml RNase in the dark at
37°C for 30 min. The cell cycle profiles were obtained
by Accuri C6 flow cytometer. ModFit LT software (Verify
Software, Topsham, MN, USA) was used to calculate the
percentages of cells in each cycle phase.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined using the CCK-8
assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells

subcellular locations were noted as 0 = negative, 1 = weak,
2 = moderate, or 3 = strong. A final score was then
calculated by multiplying the above two scores. If the final
score was equal or bigger than six, the protein expression
in the tumor was considered high; otherwise, the protein
expression in the tumor was considered low [19].

Animal studies
The male nu/nu mice (4–6 weeks old) were used and
all animal experiments were maintained in SPF Laboratory
Animal Center at Dalian Medical University. Cholesterolconjugated All Star non-silencing siRNA (NS) and NgBR
siRNA (siNgBR) for in vivo delivery were obtained
from Shanghai GenePharmaCo. (Shanghai, China).
Bel/5FU cells (5 × 106 in 100 μL PBS) were inoculated
subcutaneously into the flank of the nude mice. Two weeks
later, when the tumor diameters reached 4 mm to 5 mm,
mice were randomly divided into 4 different groups
n = 5/group): non-targeting siRNA injected group (NS),
NgBR siRNA injected group (siNgBR), non-targeting
siRNA injected plus 5-FU treatment group (NS + 5-FU)
and NgBR siRNA injected plus 5-FU treatment group
(siNgBR + 5-FU). 10 nmol indicated siRNA in 0.1 ml
saline buffer was injected intratumorally twice a week for
3 weeks [44, 45]. At the same time, 30 mg/kg 5-FU in
saline buffer was injected intraperitoneally three times per
week for 3 weeks in the 5-FU treatment groups. Tumors
were measured with a caliper every 4 days, and the
tumor volume was calculated using the formula V = 1/2
(width2 × length). At 5 weeks after tumor cell inoculation,
all mice were terminated with ether anesthesia and the
total weight of the tumors in each mouse was measured.
Tumor specimens were harvested for NgBR and p53
protein immunohistochemistry staining.
All animal maintenance and procedures were
carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations
established by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of
Dalian Medical University as well as the guidelines of the
U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocol was approved by
the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Dalian Medical
University.
