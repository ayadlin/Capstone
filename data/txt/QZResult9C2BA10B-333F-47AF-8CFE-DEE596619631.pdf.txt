Abstract
Dysregulation of androgen signaling and pericellular proteolysis is necessary for prostate cancer progression, but the links
between them are still obscure. In this study, we show how the
membrane-anchored serine protease TMPRSS2 stimulates a
proteolytic cascade that mediates androgen-induced prostate
cancer cell invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis. We found
that matriptase serves as a substrate for TMPRSS2 in mediating
this proinvasive action of androgens in prostate cancer. Further,
we determined that higher levels of TMPRSS2 expression correlate with higher levels of matriptase activation in prostate

cancer tissues. Lastly, we found that the ability of TMPRSS2 to
promote prostate cancer tumor growth and metastasis was
associated with increased matriptase activation and enhanced
degradation of extracellular matrix nidogen-1 and laminin b1
in tumor xenografts. In summary, our results establish that
TMPRSS2 promotes the growth, invasion, and metastasis of
prostate cancer cells via matriptase activation and extracellular
matrix disruption, with implications to target these two proteases as a strategy to treat prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 75(14);

Introduction

invasion (5, 6) and strongly implicated in metastasis (3). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms through which androgen signaling can induce prostate cancer cell invasion and metastasis still need more investigation.
Deregulation of pericellular proteolysis has been proposed to be
involved in cancer progression because of its role in the degradation
of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the alteration of the microenvironment (7). Recently, several lines of evidence have shown
that dysregulation of some membrane-anchored serine proteases
(MASP) contributes to the progression of many human disorders,
including tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis (8). Among
them, matriptase has been focused on because it plays crucial roles
in carcinogenesis and cancer cell invasion including prostate cancer
(9–12). In prostate cancer cells, androgens can induce matriptase
activation and shedding (13). However, the molecular mechanism
through which androgens induce matriptase activation and whether the androgen-induced proteolytic cascade plays a role in prostate
cancer progression and metastasis are still unknown.
TMPRSS2 is a member of the MASP family (14) and predominantly expressed in prostate (15). Recent studies have indicated
that a gene fusion of the 50 untranslational region of TMPRSS2 to
E26 transformation-speciﬁc (ETS) transcription factors (ERG and
ETV1) is often observed in prostate cancer tissues (16). In addition, TMPRSS2 protein level has been shown to be correlated with
prostate cancer progression (17, 18). However, the in vivo substrates of TMPRSS2 and the TMPRSS2-initiated proteolytic cascade are unknown, and the exact role of TMPRSS2 in prostate
cancer progression is still unclear. In this report, we addressed the
functional role of TMPRSS2 in androgen-induced prostate cancer
cell invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis and identiﬁed the

Prostate cancer is the most frequent male malignancy and a
leading cause of cancer-related death in many Western countries
(1). In prostate cancer, androgen signaling generally regulates the
expression of genes associated with cancer cell growth and survival (2). Because androgen signaling has been shown to be
involved in prostate cancer development and progression (3),
androgen deprivation therapy is an option for the patients.
Initially, most prostate cancer cells respond to this therapy, but
eventually tumors relapse and take on a castration therapy–
resistant prostate cancer phenotype that correlates with poor
prognosis and high metastatic potential (4). Moreover, androgen
signaling has been shown to be involved in prostate cancer cell

substrates of TMPRSS2, thus providing a mechanistic explanation
of the role of TMPRSS2 in prostate cancer progression.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
LNCaP FGC, CWR22Rv1, PC-3, DU145, VCaP, HEK293A, and
CHO cells were originally obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (19). C-81 LNCaP cells were a gift from Dr.
Ming-Fong Lin (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE;
ref. 20). Cells were tested and authenticated by genetic proﬁling
using short tandem repeat (STR) analysis.
DHT treatment
Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were then steroid-starved
in a phenol red–free RPMI 1640 medium with 5% charcoal/
dextran-stripped FBS (cFBS) for 24 hours and serum-starved for
another 24 hours. Steroid- and serum-starved cells were treated
with the indicated concentrations of DHT or an antiandrogen,
bicalutamide (Casodex) for 18 hours. Control cells were added
with an equal amount of solvent EtOH.
Lentiviral particle preparation and infection
Small hairpin RNAs [shTM2-1 (TRCN0000000266) and
shTM2-2 (TRCN0000000265)] for TMPRSS2 knockdown, and
small hairpin RNAs [shMTX-1 (TRCN0000038052) and shMTX-2
(TRCN0000038053)] for matriptase knockdown were obtained
from the National RNAi Core Facility of Academia Sinica, Taiwan.
An shRNA against luciferase (shLuc) was used as a control.
The production of lentiviral particle was described in Supplementary Information. After infection for 24 hours, the medium
was refreshed and the infected cells were selected by 2 mg/mL
puromycin.
Protein identiﬁcation using in-gel digestion and LC/MS/MS
Equal volumes of the concentrated conditioned media under
nonboiling and nonreducing conditions were resolved on 4% to
20% gradient SDS-PAGE. After staining, the target protein bands
were cut and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. The detail
procedure of in-gel digestion was described in Supplementary
Information. Peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile and
dried. The protein identify was revealed by LC/MS/MS (Thermo
LTQ-Velos and ESI-QUAD-TOF).
Cell migration, invasion, and wound-healing assays
Cell migration and invasion assays were carried out as previously described (11). For invasion assay, 15 mg Matrigel diluted in
100 mL phenol red– and serum-free RPMI1640 medium was
coated to the upper ﬁlter of each insert. No Matrigel was coated
on the ﬁlter for migration assay. Cells were steroid-starved in a
phenol red–free RPMI 1640 medium with 5% cFBS for 24 hours
and serum-starved for another 24 hours. Steroid- and serumstarved cells were seeded at a density of 4  105 cells per 200 mL
phenol red– and serum-free media into the upper well of each
transwell, and the lower wells were added with 1 mL of phenol
red–free RPMI1640 medium with 10% cFBS as chemoattractants.
Wound-healing assay was used as follows: A scratch was made
using a micropipette tip and cells were washed to remove
detached cells and debris. Photographs of the same area of the
wound were taken at 0 and 48 hours for measuring the closure of

2950 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

the wound after the treatment of the indicated concentrations of
DHT. For the DHT treatment on transwell assays, the indicated
concentrations of DHT or bicalutamide were added to both the
upper and lower wells for 48-hour incubation.
Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assays according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates, and media were refreshed every 2 days. For
DHT treatment, steroid-starved cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of DHT or bicalutamide for the various
times. SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices) was used to measure
the absorbance at 570 nm.
Western blot
Western blotting was carried out using a standard protocol as
previously described (11). Samples for detection of matriptase
(M24 and M69) and HAI-1 (M19; a gift from Dr. Chen-Yong
Lin, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington DC)
were prepared under nonboiling and nonreducing conditions,
because these antibodies mainly recognize native protein structures. M24 recognized total matriptase and activated matriptase/HAI-1 complex, and M69 speciﬁcally recognized the activated matriptase/HAI-1 complex. M19 recognized free HAI-1
and activated matriptase/HAI-1 complex (21). To analyze the
shedding of matriptase and HAI-1, the conditioned media were
collected and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifuge
ﬁlter devices (Millipore), and then analyzed by Western blot.
For other protein determination, samples were prepared under
reducing and denaturing conditions. For the determination of
the protease domain of matriptase and TMPRSS2, two polyclonal antibodies against their protease domains were obtained
from Calbiochem and Abcam, respectively. Other primary
antibodies used in this study were listed in Supplementary
Table S2.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using Maxima SYBR
Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo), and the expression levels
of target genes were statistically calculated with normalization to
GAPDH. The primers used in this study were listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Coimmunoprecipitation
HEK293A cells were cotransfected with matriptase and
TMPRSS2 plasmids in the presence of HAI-1 plasmids using
lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, cells were
cultured for 48 hours and then lysed in RIPA buffer. Cell lysates
were mixed with antibodies against ﬂag or V5 tag and gently
rotated at 4 C. Next day, protein A magnetic beads (GE) were
added to the mixture for isolating the complexes by rotation for 1
hour. After isolation, the protein–bead complexes were washed 5
times using 0.1% Tween20 TBS. The precipitated proteins were
boiled in 2 Laemmli sample buffer for 10 minutes and subjected
to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.
TMPRSS2 protease assay
The production of recombinant TMPRSS2 and matriptase
proteins was described in detail in Supplementary Information.
The insoluble fractions of LNCaP cells were prepared as described

TMPRSS2 Proteolytic Cascade in Prostate Cancer

in previous study (22). For in vitro protease activity and Matrigel
degradation assays, recombinant TMPRSS2 proteins (25 ng) were
incubated with 100 ng of recombinant matriptase proteins or
insoluble fractions of LNCaP cells, or 10 mg Matrigel (BD Biosciences) for 1 hour at 37 C in PBS. After electrophoresis, proteins
in gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 or used
for Western blot analysis.
Proteolytic activity assay
TMPRSS2-activated matriptase proteolytic activities were
examined by the measurement of a ﬂuorescence resonance energy
transfer of a protease substrate (Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC, ENZO Life
Sciences). Puriﬁed recombinant matriptase proteins (50 ng) were
incubated with or without recombinant wild-type or S441A
TMPRSS2 proteins (10 ng) for 1 hour at 37 C in PBS. After the
incubation, the substrate was added into each sample with a ﬁnal
concentration of 5 mmol/L for the protease activity assay. The
proteolytic enzymatic reaction was measured by using an ELISA
reader (PARADIGM Detection Platform; Beckman Coulter) under
an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength
of 460 nm for the indicated times.
Tumor xenografts
All procedures for animal experimental protocols were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the College of Medicine, National Taiwan University. For
subcutaneous xenograft study, 6-week-old male nude mice were
inoculated subcutaneously into the dorsal ﬂank with 106 cells in
100 mL Opti-medium plus 100 mL regular Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Tumor volume was monitored weekly by Vernier caliper
measurement of two perpendicular tumor diameters (L and W)
and then calculated using the formula: LW2/2. For analysis of the
role of TMPRSS2 in the tumor growth in an androgen-ablated
condition, male mice received casodex at a dosage of 25 mg/kg i.p.
daily until scariﬁcation. After 8 (LNCaP TMPRSS2-knockdown
group) or 16 weeks (LNCaP TMPRSS2-overexpression group), the
mice were scariﬁed and individual tumors were taken and
weighed. For analyzing metastasis, SCID mice were anesthetized
by 1.2% of avertin, and then 2  105 of shLuc or shTM2 LNCaP
cells were injected into the anterior prostate lobes of each mouse,
since intraprostatic injection of LNCaP cells in SCID mice has
shown to serve as a useful animal model to investigate mechanisms of metastasis (23). Sixteen weeks after orthotopic injection,
the mice were euthanized, and the end-point tumor masses were
weighed and statistically calculated with mean  SEM. LNCaP
cells with the passage numbers below 40 were used for the
experiments since the cells still kept their androgen sensitivity.
The passage numbers of the stable pools used for the experiments
were within 10 passages, when the ﬁrst selection of the stable
pools was denoted as the ﬁrst passage for the stable pools.
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
The tumor sections on slides were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS.
Samples were stained with primary antibodies TMPRSS2
(1:500; Abcam), M24 (1:250), and M69 (1:250), and then
followed by secondary FITC or Alexa568-conjugated mouse or
rabbit antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Slides
were examined and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot
ﬂuorescence microscope.

Immunohistochemical staining of prostate tissue sections
Three human prostate tissue arrays were purchased from US
Biomax. The details about tissue assays were described in Supplementary Information. Immunohistochemical staining was
carried out as previously described (24). The immunohistochemical images were scored by the percentage (P) of staining of tumor
cells or prostate epithelial cells (0, <10%; 1, 10%–25%; 2, 25%–
50%; 3, 50%–75%; 4, >75%) and by the intensity of staining (I; 0,
negative staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; and 3,
strong staining). The scoring results of each sample were the
combination of P plus I values. To deﬁne protein expression
levels, the scores of 3 were classiﬁed as belonging to the lowexpression group, and the scores above 3 were classiﬁed to
the high-expression group. The c2 test was used to evaluate the
correlation between activated matriptase and TMPRSS2 expression. A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
Statistical analysis
The intensities of images or bands were measured using ImageJ
software, analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software), expressed as mean  SEM, and statistically calculated using
ANOVA program. P values of less than 0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant in all studies.  denotes a P value less than 0.05; 
denotes a P value less than 0.01;  denotes a P value less than

Results
Involvement of TMPRSS2 in androgen-induced prostate cancer
cell invasion
To analyze the effect of androgens on prostate cancer cell
motility, androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells were used for cell migration and invasion assays because the cells are the most representative model for studying androgen signaling in prostate cancer
cells (20). Figure 1A and B showed that DHT induced the cell
invasion and migration in a dose-response manner, reaching to
the induction plateau by 10 nmol/L DHT. Hereafter, the concentrations of 10 nmol/L DHT were used for following experiments.
Bicalutamide, an antiandrogen reagent, could block this DHTinduced prostate cancer cell motility (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig.
S1A). To further identify which MASP was involved in androgeninduced prostate cancer cell invasion, we ﬁrst analyzed the effects
of DHT on the expression of MASPs in LNCaP cells. The results
showed that DHT signiﬁcantly induced the expression of
TMPRSS2 but not the other MASPs, and that the induction of
TMPRSS2 was antagonized by bicalutamide, a similar induction
phenomenon as seen in the well-known androgen-regulated
gene, PSA (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). Moreover, DHT
not only signiﬁcantly induced the expression of TMPRSS2 protein
with two molecular masses of 60 (full-length) and 38 kDa (Nterminus) in a dose-responsive manner (Fig. 1D), but also dramatically induced the expression of PSA protein and promote cell
growth (Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E), indicating that the
LNCaP cells still keep androgen sensitivity. We further explore the
role of TMPRSS2 in androgen-induced prostate cancer cell invasion and found that TMPRSS2 silencing signiﬁcantly abrogated
DHT-induced prostate cancer cell invasion, returning it to basal
levels (Fig. 1E and F; Supplementary Fig. S1F), while this silencing
did not signiﬁcantly affect DHT-induced LNCaP cell proliferation
within 48 hours after the treatment in comparison with shLuc

invasion of prostate cancer cells.
Identiﬁcation of TMPRSS2 substrates in prostate cancer cells
To identify putative TMPRSS2 substrate(s) in human prostate
cancer cells, we established a stable clone of doxycycline-inducible TMPRSS2-overexpressing LNCaP cells. Upon induction, the
expression of exogenous TMPRSS2 proteins was dramatically
increased (Fig. 2A). The conditioned media after the induction
were collected for SDS-PAGE and gel staining. The intensities of
the four main protein bands were increased in the conditioned
media of TMPRSS2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2B, #1 to 4). These
four bands were cut out from the gel for in-gel protein digestion
and LC/MS/MS analysis. Several membrane-anchored proteins
were identiﬁed as listed in Fig. 2C and Supplementary Table S3.
Among them, MASP matriptase caught our attention as a putative
TMPRSS2 substrate owing to its high frequency of appearance and
having the same membranous localization as TMPRSS2.
TMPRSS2 induces matriptase activation
To further examine whether TMPRSS2 could induce matriptase
activation in prostate cancer cells, we selected two stable clones of
TMPRSS2-overexpressing LNCaP cells and found that the overexpression of TMPRSS2 increased the activated levels of matriptase, which formed a 120-kDa complex with HAI-1 and occurred
along with reduced levels of latent matriptase (70 kDa) and free

2952 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

HAI-1 (50 kDa; Fig. 3A), with no effect on matriptase and HAI-1
gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S2A). These data indicate
that TMPRSS2 can induce matriptase activation in prostate cancer
cells. We then used doxycycline-inducible TMPRSS2-expressing
LNCaP cells to analyze the role of TMPRSS2 in matriptase activation. TMPRSS2 was expressed starting at 2 hours after induction
and the activation of matriptase followed at 4 hours after induction (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Together, these results indicate
that TMPRSS2 can induce matriptase activation in LNCaP cells.
Similar results for TMPRSS2-induced matriptase activation were
also observed in CWR22Rv1, PC-3, and C-81 LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C), suggesting that TMPRSS2-induced matriptase activation is a common phenomenon in prostate cancer cells.
Overexpression of TMPRSS2 in CWR22Rv1 cells also could
enhance the cell invasion and anchorage-independent growth
(Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2E), suggesting that TMPRSS2
plays roles in prostate cancer cell invasion and tumor growth.
Moreover, TMPRSS2 silencing signiﬁcantly decreased the levels of
activated matriptase (Fig. 3B). To avoid the off-target effects of
shRNAs and to conﬁrm the speciﬁc role of TMPRSS2 in matriptase
activation, we constructed a TMPRSS2-overexpression plasmid
with a resistance to shTM2-1 by generating a silent mutation on
the shRNA-targeting site. These data showed that the overexpression of TMPRSS2 was able to rescue matriptase activation in the
TMPRSS2-knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S2F). Together,
these data strongly indicate that TMPRSS2 plays a role in matriptase activation in human prostate cancer cells.

Matriptase is a substrate of TMPRSS2
To investigate whether matriptase is a substrate of TMPRSS2, we
ﬁrst used pull-down assays to analyze if TMPRSS2 could form a
complex with matriptase. The results showed that matriptase
could be pulled down by wild-type TMPRSS2 with less afﬁnity
by S441A TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS2 could be brought out by
matriptase (Fig. 3C). This suggests that TMPRSS2 can form a
complex with matriptase. To further investigate the direct role of
TMPRSS2 in the activation of matriptase, we puriﬁed recombinant TMPRSS2 proteins with the extracellular regions of wild-type
or S441A TMPRSS2 for proteolytic assays. The results showed that
recombinant wild-type TMPRSS2 proteins could undergo autoactivation after puriﬁcation, which was indicated by the release of
its protease domain, whereas S441A TMPRSS2 mutant lost this
autoproteolytic property (Fig. 3D, left). Then, the insoluble fraction of LNCaP cell lysate containing matriptase zymogen was
mixed with these two recombinant TMPRSS2 proteins. Using a
speciﬁc antibody against the matriptase protease domain, we
found that recombinant wild-type TMPRSS2 but not its protease-null mutant could induce matriptase activation, indicated by
the released matriptase's protease domain (26 kDa; Fig. 3D,
right). To further analyze if TMPRSS2 could directly activate
matriptase via proteolysis, we performed in vitro proteolytic assays
and found that wild-type recombinant TMPRSS2, but not its
protease-null mutant could release the protease domain (26 kDa)
of puriﬁed recombinant wild-type matriptase (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, the role of TMPRSS2 in activating the proteolytic activity of
matriptase was determined using an in vitro proteolytic assay with
a substrate Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC. The results showed that active
TMPRSS2 robustly increased the proteolytic activity of recombinant matriptase, compared with matriptase or TMPRSS2 alone
(Fig. 3F). In addition, these two recombinant TMPRSS2 proteins
were added into shLuc and shTM2 LNCaP cell cultures. The wildtype recombinant TMPRSS2, but not its protease-null mutant
could enhance the activation and shedding of matriptase in shLuc
LNCaP cells, and rescue matriptase activation and shedding in
shTM2 LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Taken together,
these data indicate that TMPRSS2 can activate its substrate matriptase via a direct proteolytic process in prostate cancer cells.

TMPRSS2 has an important role in DHT-induced matriptase
activation in prostate cancer cells
To further explore whether TMPRSS2 is involved in androgen
signaling to enhance matriptase activation in prostate cancer
cells, we used immunoblotting to analyze the DHT effect on the
activated levels of matriptase in shLuc or shTM2 LNCaP cells. As
shown in Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S3C, DHT dramatically induced the expression of TMPRSS2 and increased the
activated levels of matriptase in shLuc LNCaP cells, whereas
TMPRSS2 silencing reduced the induction effect of DHT on
matriptase activation. Furthermore, the role of TMPRSS2 in
androgen-induced matriptase activation was examined in VCaP
cells because this cell line presumably exhibits TMPRSS2
knockout effect due to the gene fusion of TMPRSS promoter
with ERG (16). Unexpectedly, the results showed that DHT
could dramatically induce TMPRSS2 and ERG expression and
reached the induction plateau by 1 nmol/L DHT, and simultaneously promoted matriptase activation (Fig. 4B). The results
for androgen-induced TMPRSS2 expression and matriptase
activation in VCaP cells were very similar to the phenomena
observed in LNCaP cells. Together, these data indicate that
TMPRSS2 functions as an androgen-induced protease that is
important for the promotion of matriptase activation and
prostate cancer cell invasion.
Role of matriptase in DHT-induced LNCaP cell invasion
To further explore the role of matriptase in DHT-induced
prostate cancer cell invasion, we analyzed the effect of DHT on
the invasion of matriptase-knockdown LNCaP cells. As shown
in Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary Fig. S3D, matriptase silencing reduced matriptase protein levels by approximately 80% and
30% in shMTX-1 and shMTX-2 LNCaP cells, leading to approximate 60% and 20% decrease in cell invasion. To further explore if
matriptase was involved in androgen-induced prostate cancer cell
invasion and TMPRSS2 expression, we examined the DHT effect
on the invasion of shMTX-1 LNCaP cells and found matriptase
knockdown signiﬁcantly reduced DHT-induced prostate cancer
cell invasion (Fig. 4E), but did not interrupt DHT-induced
TMPRSS2 expression (Fig. 4F). Together, the results indicate that

matriptase is important for androgen-induced TMPRSS2 expression that promotes prostate cancer cell invasion.
Identiﬁcation of extracellular components as substrates of
TMPRSS2
To further explore if TMPRSS2 can also proteolytically cleave
some components of the ECM, the recombinant wild-type or
S441A TMPRSS2 proteins (Fig. 5A) were incubated with Matrigel.
The result (Fig. 5B) showed that the 160-kDa band was absent
after the wild-type TMPRSS2 reaction but not after its proteasenull mutant. The 160-kDa band in the gel was cut out for LC/MS/
MS analysis, and laminin b1, laminin g1, and nidogen-1 were
identiﬁed as putative TMPRSS2's substrates according to their
molecular weights (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Table S4). Immuno-

blot analysis (Fig. 5D) showed that wild-type TMPRSS2 but not its
S441A mutant dramatically decreased the protein levels of nidogen-1 (right), partly degraded laminin b1 (left), and had no
signiﬁcant effect on laminin g1 (middle). These results imply
that TMPRSS2 can proteolytically degrade laminin b1 and nidogen-1 but not laminin g1, leading to a loose ECM network. To
clarify whether there was a role of ECM degradation in TMPRSS2induced prostate cancer cell invasion or growth, ECM was preincubated with recombinant wild-type TMPRSS2 (rTM2) or protease-null TMPRSS2 (rS441A) proteins and then used to coat on
transwells for cell invasion assays or for cell proliferation assays.
Because PC-3 cells expressed none or little TMPRSS2 (Supplementary Fig. S3E), PC-3 cells were then selected to investigate the
role of ECM degradation in TMPRSS2-elicited prostate cancer cell

invasion and proliferation. As shown in the Fig. 5E, PC3 cell
invasion capability was signiﬁcantly increased by approximately
1.7 folds in the transwells coated with rTM2-treated Matrigel,
compared with those in the transwells coated with ECM without
any treatment (control) or treated with protease-null rTM2
(S441A). Moreover, TMPRSS2-degraded ECM had no signiﬁcant
effect on PC3 cell proliferation (Fig. 5F) and matriptase activation
(Supplementary Fig. S3F). Thus, the results indicate that the
degradation of ECM by TMPRSS2 plays important role in promoting prostate cancer cell invasion but had no role in TMPRSS2elicited cell proliferation. Together, these data suggest that in
addition to direct induction of matriptase activation, TMPRSS2
also can degrade ECM components, laminin b1, and nidogen-1,
contributing to prostate cancer cell invasion.
Examination of TMPRSS2 role in tumor growth in vivo
To further investigate the role of TMPRSS2 in prostate
tumor growth, shLuc and shTM2 LNCaP cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Tumor growth in xenograft mice
was monitored by measuring tumor volumes weekly and
tumor weights at the end point. Tumor volumes derived from
shTM2 cells were signiﬁcantly smaller than those from shLuc
cells (Fig. 6A), whereas the body weights of shTM2 mice were
greater than those of shLuc mice (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
After scariﬁcation, the average of the tumor weights was signiﬁcantly reduced in the shTM2 mice, compared with the
control group (Fig. 6B). We further analyzed the expression
of TMPRSS2 and matriptase in the xenograft tumors and found
that the expression level of TMPRSS2 and the activated level of
matriptase were remarkably decreased in the whole lysates of
shTM2 tumors (Fig. 6C). Immunoﬂuorescence results further

www.aacrjournals.org

conﬁrmed that a decreased level of TMPRSS2 was observed in
shTM2 tumors and occurred in parallel with a reduced level of
total and activated matriptase, compared with shLuc tumors
(Fig. 6D; Supplementary Fig. S4B). These results indicate that
TMPRSS2 plays a role in prostate cancer tumor growth and
matriptase activation during the cancer progression. To further
test whether increased TMPRSS2 expression could promote
androgen-independent tumor growth, LNCaP cells with overexpression of wild-type TMPRSS2 (TM2), its protease-null
mutant (S441A), and control cells (PLKO) were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. To mimic prostate cancer patients
receiving androgen ablation therapy, mice were administrated
daily with casodex, an antiandrogen reagent. As shown in Fig.
6E, the tumor volumes of TM2 cells grew more quickly than
those of PLKO and S441A cells, whereas the body weights
among these three groups showed no signiﬁcant difference
(Supplementary Fig. S4C). The average of the tumor volumes
was signiﬁcantly increased in the TM2 group from week 13,
compared with the other two groups (Fig. 6E). Interestingly, the
average of S441A tumor weight was signiﬁcantly reduced in
comparison with the control group, suggesting that this
TMPRSS2 mutant may exhibit a dominant negative function
(Fig. 6F). We further found that the expression of TMPRSS2 and
the activated level of matriptase were increased in TM2 but not
S441A tumors (Fig. 6G). The immunoﬂuorescence results further showed that both levels of TMPRSS2 and activated matriptase were increased in TM2 tumor tissues compared with PLKO
tumors (Fig. 6H; Supplementary Fig. S4D). Interestingly, the
immunoﬂuorescence images in S441A xenografted tumors
showed that the higher expression of S441A TMPRSS2 correlated with a lower level of activated matriptase (Fig. 6H),

suggesting that S441A TMPRSS2 mutant lacked the ability
to proteolytically activate matriptase in tumor lesions, as
shown in the in vitro proteolytic assays (Fig. 3E and F). Ki67
IHC staining showed that the amounts of Ki67-positive cells
were signiﬁcantly increased in TM2 tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S4E). In the xenograft tumor lesions, TMPRSS2 signiﬁcantly
reduced the protein level of nidogen-1 and induced the degradation of laminin b1 (80-kDa fragment), whereas the S441A
TMPRSS2 mutant did not act on both proteins (Fig. 6I; Supplementary Fig. S4F). These data together indicate that
TMPRSS2 plays roles in the tumor growth of prostate cancer
and promotes androgen-independent cancer growth, which
occur in parallel with increased levels of activated matriptase
in the tumor lesions.
Role of TMPRSS2 in prostate cancer metastasis
To further evaluate the role of TMPRSS2 in prostate cancer
metastasis, shLuc and shTM2 LNCaP cells were orthotopically
injected into the anterior prostates of SCID mice. After 16 weeks,
62.5% of orthotopic tumors (5/8) showed cancer metastases to
adrenal glands in the shLuc group, compared with the shTM2
group [1/7 (14.2%); Fig. 6J]. The average of the orthotopic tumor
weights was signiﬁcantly reduced in the shTM2 group compared
with the control group (Supplementary Fig. S4G). To further
analyze the expression of TMPRSS2 and matriptase in orthotopic
and metastatic lesions, the IHC results (Fig. 6K) showed that
compared with the primary tumors, increased levels of TMPRSS2
and activated matriptase were observed in metastatic tumor
lesions of shLuc mice. The intensities of activated matriptase were
reduced in parallel with TMPRSS2 reduction in the primary
tumors of the shTM2 group compared with shLuc mice. The effect
of TMPRSS2 knockdown on the proliferation of shTM2-1 LNCaP
cells was further examined. The results (Supplementary Fig. S4I)
showed that TMPRSS2 silencing exhibited no signiﬁcant effect on
the cell proliferation in a regular culture condition, suggesting
what TMPRSS2-knockdown cells exhibited low metastatic rate is
apparently not due to the slower growth rate of shTM2-1 cells. The
results together indicate that TMPRSS2 plays a role in prostate

2956 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

cancer metastasis and occurs along with the activation of
matriptase.
Correlation of TMPRSS2 protein levels with the levels of
activated matriptase in archival prostate cancer specimens
To evaluate the clinical relevance of TMPRSS2 expression and
the status of matriptase activation, we used IHC to examine the
levels of TMPRSS2 and activated matriptase in human prostate
cancer specimens. The protein levels of TMPRSS2 were positively
correlated with the levels of activated matriptase in the prostate
cancer specimens (Fig. 6L; Supplementary Fig. S5A). Moreover,
the levels of TMPRSS2, total matriptase, and activated matriptase
were increased following cancer progression up to a moderate
stage of prostate cancer, but showed a reduced level in poorly
differentiated tissues, similar to noncancerous tissues (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Moreover, the results (Supplementary Fig.
S5C) from the overall correlation analysis further showed that
the levels of TMPRSS2, total matriptase, and activated matriptase
were signiﬁcantly increased in the cancerous group compared
with the normal group. These ﬁndings suggest a strong correlation
between the levels of TMPRSS2 and activated matriptase during
prostate cancer progression.

Discussion
Recent reports have indicated that androgen signaling can
induce the invasive ability of prostate cancer cells (5). However,
the molecular mechanisms by which androgen signaling
enhances prostate cancer cell invasion, tumor growth, and
metastasis are still unclear. In this study, we found that
TMPRSS2 is an important androgen-regulated gene that can
promote prostate cancer tumor growth and metastasis, via
matriptase activation and degradation of ECM laminin b1 and
nidogen-1. Thus, TMPRSS2 is implicated in the acceleration of
prostate cancer progression.
Although androgen signaling has been strongly implicated in
prostate cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential (25), levels
of the androgen receptor (AR) have a controversial role in prostate

cancer progression. Several studies have indicated that AR signaling plays a positive role in prostate cancer cell invasion, at least via
upregulation of MMP-2/-9 activity and the PI3-kinase pathway (5,
6). Conversely, restoration of AR expression in PC3 cells decreases
cell invasion (26), tumorigenicity, and metastasis (27) and also
results in the suppression of cell proliferation by androgens (28).
One possibility is that PC-3 cells are not a typical adenocarcinoma
of prostate since PC3 cells have been shown with the neuroendocrine cell phenotype (29). However, the reasons why AR overexpression in PC3 cells reduces the malignant behavior of the cells
still remain largely unknown. In this study, our data suggest that
androgen signaling exhibits an induction effect on prostate cancer
cell invasion via upregulation of its target gene TMPRSS2. In
prostate cancer, the expression level of TMPRSS2 has shown a
signiﬁcant increase in malignant cancer tissues compared with
benign tissues (18, 30), whereas TMPRSS2 expression level in
metastatic cancer tissues is not signiﬁcantly different from that in
benign prostatic tissues (18). Our data also indicate that the

www.aacrjournals.org

protein level of TMPRSS2 is signiﬁcantly increased in moderately
and intermediately differentiated prostate cancer tissues (GS56&7) compared with normal prostate tissues. However, there is no
statistical difference in TMPRSS2 expression between poorly
differentiated tissues (GS8-10) and benign tissues. The results
thus indicate that the expression of TMPRSS2 is correlated with
prostate cancer progression up to an aggressive but not a metastatic stage, and raised the question of whether TMPRSS2 plays a
role in prostate cancer tumor growth and metastasis. Our results
from in vivo experiments further verify that TMPRSS2 has a
positive role in the tumor growth and metastasis of prostate
cancer, and indicate that the elevation of TMPRSS2 in prostate
cancer cells also contributes to tumor growth under androgenablated conditions. Moreover, in the metastatic lesions of orthotopic xenograft mice, the levels of PSA (Supplementary Fig S4H),
TMPRSS2 proteins, and activated matriptase were much higher
than those in their primary tumors. These data suggest that when
prostate cancer cells gain additional androgen signaling to induce

Figure 7.
Schematic model for TMPRSS2-promoted prostate cancer cell invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis. In prostate cancer cells, androgens can induce TMPRSS2
expression via activating AR to bind the androgen response element (ARE). Androgen-induced TMPRSS2 initiates a pericellular proteolytic cascade to
activate matriptase that promotes prostate cancer cell invasion. Moreover, TMPRSS2 can also promote prostate cancer tumorigenicity and metastasis, which occurs
along with degradation of ECM components, nidogen-1, and laminin b1. Thus, TMPRSS2 can mediate matriptase activation by androgens and disrupt the ECM
network, leading to prostate cancer cell invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis.

TMPRSS2 expression and activated matriptase, those cancer cells
are highly metastatic and move out their primary regions to
other places. The remaining cancer cells in the primary regions
of poorly differentiated prostate cancer only exhibit normal or
low androgen signaling that cannot further induce TMPRSS2
expression and matriptase activation. This may explain why the
levels of TMPRSS2 expression and matriptase activation in the in
situ poorly differentiated prostate cancer tissues become no difference from those in normal prostate tissues. These data, therefore, suggest that TMPRSS2 has an oncogenic potential to promote prostate cancer progression and metastasis, even in androgen-ablated conditions.
Tmprss2/ TRAMP mice have shown with reduced metastasis
but larger primary tumors, compared with Tmprss2þ/þ TRAMP
mice. However, knockdown of TMPRSS2 in LNCaP C4-2B cells
suppressed their cell growth (31). Our results (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Fig. S1G) showed that TMPRSS2 silencing reduced
prostate cancer tumor growth and androgen-induced LNCaP cell
growth. The discrepancy of the tumor growth between TRAMP
and xenograft mouse models, and the role of TMPRSS2 in androgen-induced prostate cancer cell growth may be due to the
difference of prostate cancer cell types, mouse neuroendocrine/
poor differentiated tumors versus human prostate adenocarcinoma. This is because the TRAMP mouse models have been shown to
often develop neuroendocrine and poor differentiated tumors
accompanied by diminished AR activity following the disease
progression (32, 33). Thus, our data indicate that in human
prostate cancers, TMPRSS2 plays a positive role in androgeninduced prostate cancer cell invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis. In TRAMP model, TMPRSS2 mainly plays a role in cell
invasion and metastasis. The differential roles of TMPRSS2 in the
tumor growth between the TRAMP and xenograft mouse models
may be due to the differences of prostate cancer cell types or
TMPRSS2's substrates, etc. and need more investigation.
In this report, we also identiﬁed matriptase as a substrate of
TMPRSS2 in prostate cancer cells and delineated a proteolytic
cascade from TMPRSS2 to matriptase that mediates androgen-

2958 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

induced prostate cancer cell invasion. Our results support that
TMPRSS2 is a molecular linkage through which androgens can
induce matriptase activation. Although the previous report indicated that matriptase activation undergoes an autoactivation
process in vitro (22), this is the ﬁrst report of matriptase activation
by another membrane-anchored serine protease, TMPRSS2, in
response to androgens. Moreover, recent reports have also shown
that downregulated expression of two cognate inhibitors of
matriptase (HAI-1 and HAI-2) is correlated with the progression
of prostate cancer and other cancers (34–37) and occurs in
parallel with matriptase activation and cancer cell invasion
(24, 38). Thus, reduced levels of HAI-1 or HAI-2 contribute
to matriptase activation and cancer progression. In this study,
we also observed that TMPRSS2 could promote HAI-1 shedding
in prostate cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). HAI-1 has
been shown to play an important role in the biosynthesis,
intracellular trafﬁcking, activation, and inhibition of matriptase, with functions as a matriptase's body guard to prevent
inappropriate matriptase proteolytic activity during the protease synthesis and trafﬁcking to plasma membrane, as well as a
cognate inhibitor for matriptase inhibition after this protease
activation (39). The proper balance between matriptase and
HAI-1 is quite important for matriptase life cycle. The HAI-1
shedding induced by TMPRSS2 may lower down the inhibition
function of HAI-1 on matriptase and concomitantly prolong
the proteolytic activity of matriptase. These data together suggest that in addition to the direct role of TMPRSS2 in the
proteolytic activation of matriptase, TMPRSS2 also simultaneously reduces cellular HAI-1 by shedding to further enhance
matriptase proteolytic activity. Moreover, since HAI-1 can also
inhibit other pericellular serine proteases, including hepsin and
prostasin (40), the shedding of HAI-1 by TMPRSS2 may also
cause the activation of these pericellular proteases. Together,
androgen-induced TMPRSS2 expression or its overexpression
following prostate cancer progression can activate matriptase
and/or other HAI-1–modulated serine proteases, leading to
promoting prostate cancer progression.

TMPRSS2 Proteolytic Cascade in Prostate Cancer

The microenvironment is important for tumor development
and progression. The ECM in the microenvironment plays an
important role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis (41).
Disruption of ECM integrity renders the microenvironment invasion-permissive and allows cancer cell growth and invasion (42,
43). Cancer cells often secrete proteolytic enzymes to degrade the
ECM and invade the surrounding tissue (44). Our results indicate
that upregulation of TMPRSS2 can directly activate matriptase and
degrade ECM components nidogen-1 and laminin b1, leading to
prostate cancer progression. Nidogen-1 functions as a key component for basement membrane assembly by connecting laminin
and collagen networks and integrating other ECM components
(45), and decreased expression of nidogen-1 can weaken the
strength of the basement membrane and the interaction between
cancer cells and the ECM, leading to the promotion of cancer cell
invasion and metastasis (46). Moreover, matriptase activation has
been shown to alter the microenvironment by degradation of
ﬁbronectin and laminin (47), or by activation of pro-HGF, PAR-2,
uPA, and MMP-1/-3 (10), all contributing to tumor growth and
metastasis. Thus, these data strongly suggest that dysregulation of
the proteolytic cascade of TMPRSS2 to matriptase can result in
ECM degradation and alteration of the tumor microenvironment
in favor of cancer cell penetration and prostate cancer progression.
In conclusion, our results suggest that the expression of
TMPRSS2 induced by androgens can initiate a pericellular proteolytic cascade to activate matriptase that promotes prostate
cancer cell invasion. Moreover, TMPRSS2 can also promote prostate cancer tumorigenicity and metastasis, which occurs along
with degradation of ECM components, nidogen-1 and laminin
b1. Thus, TMPRSS2 can mediate matriptase activation by androgens and disrupt the ECM network integrity, leading to prostate
cancer cell invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis (Fig. 7). We
may explain why TMPRSS2 overexpression or increased matriptase activity following prostate cancer progression is associated
with a high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. These data
further provide compelling evidence of a serine protease cascade
regulated by androgen signaling to promote prostate cancer
progression and metastasis. Hence, TMPRSS2 and matriptase may

be valuable molecular targets for the development of novel
therapeutic approaches to suppress prostate cancer progression
and metastasis.
