ABSTRACT
High-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) are genomically complex,
heterogeneous cancers with a high mortality rate, due to acquired chemoresistance and
lack of targeted therapy options. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi) target the
retinoblastoma (RB) signaling network, and have been successfully incorporated into
treatment regimens for breast and other cancers. Here, we have compared mechanisms
of response and resistance to three CDKi that target either CDK4/6 or CDK2 and abrogate
E2F target gene expression. We identify CCNE1 gain and RB1 loss as mechanisms of
resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition, whereas receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and RAS
signaling is associated with CDK2 inhibitor resistance. Mechanistically, we show that
ETS factors are mediators of RTK/RAS signaling that cooperate with E2F in cell cycle
progression. Consequently, CDK2 inhibition sensitizes cyclin E1-driven but not RASdriven ovarian cancer cells to platinum-based chemotherapy. In summary, this study
outlines a rational approach for incorporating CDKi into treatment regimens for HGSOC.

survival rate for ovarian cancer has been largely stagnant
over several decades and remains only around 40% [3],
rendering ovarian cancer the leading cause of death among
gynecologic malignancies. Thus, there is a dire need for
novel therapeutic strategies to improve HGSOC outcome.
Here, we have taken a systematic approach to
assess cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi) for
their potential in HGSOC treatment. CDKi target the
retinoblastoma signaling pathway [4, 5], one of the most
frequently altered signaling networks in HGSOC [2] and
other cancers [6]. Therefore, CDKi could potentially
benefit a large number of patients. However, early
generation CDKi, such as Flavopiridol, failed in the
clinic. Recently, two CDKi with different target spectra

INTRODUCTION
The term ovarian cancer describes a set of diseases
with vastly differing tumor biology, signature genetic
aberrations, and associated outcomes [1]. Within this
complex, high-grade papillary serous ovarian cancer
(HGSOC) is the most common and aggressive form [2],
accounting for the majority of ovarian cancer-related
deaths. HGSOC is characterized by TP53 mutation
and a high number of DNA copy number aberrations
targeting known oncogenes (e.g. MYC 30%, CCNE1 20%,
MECOM 25%, KRAS 11%) and tumor suppressor genes
(e.g. PTEN 7%, RB1 8%) [2]. Since the introduction of
platinum and taxane combination therapy, the five-year

have entered phase 3 clinical trials in human cancer.
PD0332991 (palbociclib), a specific inhibitor of CDK4
and CDK6 (CDK4/6) [7], shown to induce proliferation
arrest and senescence in several different cancer types
[8–11], was labeled a break through drug by the FDA
in 2013 for its promising activity in estrogen receptorpositive breast cancer when combined with the aromatase
inhibitor, letrozole. Similarly, the CDK1 and CDK2
(CDK1/2) inhibitor dinaciclib [12] entered a phase 3 trial
in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Interphase CDK phosphorylate and inactivate
the RB tumor suppressor protein and related pocket
proteins, p107 (RBL1) and p130 (RBL2) [13]. This
allows activator E2F transcription factors to transcribe
genes required for G1-S transition, as well as DNA repair
genes, such as BRCA1 [14]. CDK require specific cyclin
binding partners for their activity: E-type cyclins (cyclin
E1, CCNE1; cyclin E2, CCNE2) bind to and activate
CDK2, whereas the D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, CCND1;
cyclin D2, CCND2; cyclin D3, CCND3) specifically
activate CDK4/6. Accumulating evidence suggests
that cyclin E-CDK2 signaling is an important driver of
HGSOC proliferation. First, CCNE1 (20%), CCNE2 (3%)
and CDK2 (3%) are frequently amplified in HGSOC [2].
Second, both cyclin E1 and CDK2 were identified in a
genome-wide shRNA screen as potential lineage-specific
requirement genes [15]. Third, deregulated cyclin E1 can
transform Trp53-mutant fallopian tube epithelial cells [16],
which can give rise to HGSOC [17]. Though cyclin D
genes are less frequently amplified in HGSOC (CCND1:
4%, CCND2 6%, CCND3 3%), cyclin D is downstream of
and required for the oncogenic activity of RAS, MYC and
ERBB2 [18–20]. Therefore, cyclin D and cyclin E may
be differentially required in different subsets of HGSOC,
indicating that CDK4/6 inhibitors and CDK1/2 inhibitors
may be most effective in distinct responder populations.
We have directly compared the response
and resistance mechanisms for CDK4/6 inhibition
(PD0332991) and CDK2 inhibition (SNS032 [21];
dinaciclib) in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. Genetic
and pharmacological experiments reveal that cyclin
E1-dependent signaling confers resistance to CDK4/6
inhibition whereas receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
signaling contributes to CDK2 resistance. We further
identify ETS transcription factors as critical downstream
mediators of RTK signaling that are induced as part
of the cell cycle machinery and cooperate with E2F
transcription factors in controlling proliferation. Our
results suggest that, due to the ability of cyclin D- and
cyclin E-dependent signaling pathways to compensate
for one another, in conjunction with frequent genetic
alterations in HGSOC affecting both signaling arms,
CDKi may not be efficient as single agents in the majority
of HGSOC. Instead, our data indicate that CDKi may be
most useful in combination therapy for genetically defined
subsets of cancers. In a proof-of-principle study we show
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that dinaciclib can sensitize cyclin E1-dependent cells to
platinum-based chemotherapy. In order to stratify patients
for dinaciclib treatment, CCNE1 amplification detectable
by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or Southern
Blot, is readily available as a companion diagnostic.
Therefore, our study outlines a rational approach to
incorporate CDKi into ovarian cancer treatment regimens.

RESULTS
CDKi impair E2F target gene expression and
inhibit ETS gene transcription
In order to assess the therapeutic potential of
CDKi in HGSOC, we determined responses of ovarian
cancer cell lines to three CDKi with different CDK
specificity and selectivity: PD0332991 (palbociclib),
SNS032 and dinaciclib (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1).
Previous studies have established RB1 proficiency and
CDKN2A (p16INK4A) deletion as the main determinants
of PD0332991 sensitivity [9, 10]. Using a luminometric
viability assay, we tested PD0332991 sensitivity in
a panel of 10 ovarian cancer cell lines with different
signature genetic alterations (Supplementary Table 2). We
confirmed that CDKN2A-deficient cell lines were sensitive
to CDK4/6 inhibition (IC50 values < 1 μM; HEY, DOV13,
Fig. 1a). The SKOV3 cell line, while CDKN2A-null,
showed intermediate sensitivity (Fig. 1a). Biochemically,
PD0332991-sensitive cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA433,
HEY, DOV13) had low expression of cyclin E1 RNA and
protein with concomitant high expression of RB protein
(Supplementary Fig. 1a). In contrast, cell lines with high
cyclin E1 expression and low RB (CAOV3, OVCAR3,
OVCAR4, OAW28, all with genomic RB1 loss and/or
CCNE1 gain, Supplementary Table 2) were resistant to
PD0332991 (Fig. 1a).
Next, we determined IC50 values for the CDK2
inhibitors SNS032 and dinaciclib. OAW28, OVCAR4
and SKOV3 were most resistant to both drugs (Fig. 1a,
SNS032 IC50 ≥  181.6  nM, dinaciclib IC50 ≥  14.5  nM),
whereas HEY, DOV13 and OV90 were most sensitive
(Fig. 1a, SNS032 IC50 ≤ 77.7 nM, dinaciclib IC50 ≤ 5.7 nM).
Two of the three most sensitive cell lines (HEY, DOV13)
were TP53-wildtype and expressed low levels of cyclin E1
RNA and protein. In contrast, two of the three most
resistant lines (OAW28, OVCAR4) were TP53-mutant and
expressed high levels of cyclin E1 (Supplemental Fig. 1a,
Supplementary Table 2). OVCAR3, the only CCNE1amplified cell line in this panel, displayed intermediate
sensitivity for SNS032 and dinaciclib (Fig. 1a, 122.2 nM
and 7.0 nM, respectively). We conclude that additional
factors besides cyclin E1 expression level determine
cellular response to CDK2 inhibition. Similarly, reduced
cell viability following cyclin E1 depletion was not limited
to cyclin E1-overexpressing lines (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
This suggests that the majority of ovarian cancer cell lines

PD0332991 (palbociclib) and CDK2 inhibitors, SNS032 and dinaciclib in 10 ovarian cancer cell lines. Cell viability was measured using
a luminometric assay following 7d (PD0332991) or 72 h (SNS032, dinaciclib) of exposure to increasing concentrations of drug. The IC50
values displayed represent the mean plus SEM (n = 2) ranked from top to bottom from the most sensitive (HEY) to the most resistant
(OAW28). PD0332991-resistant cell lines have IC50 values > 2 μM, while PD0332991-sensitive lines have IC50 values < 0.5 μM. SKOV3
cells display intermediate sensitivity. In contrast, IC50 values for SNS032 and dinaciclib fall along a continuum (0.05–0.25 μM for SNS032,
0.005–0.015 μM for dinaciclib). (b) CDKi-resistant cells avoid CDKi-mediated cell cycle arrest. Naïve HEY cells were treated with vehicle
(control), 0.5 μM PD0332991, 0.2 μM SNS032 or 0.02 μM dinaciclib for 48 h and analyzed by BrdU/PI staining. HEY-PDR and HEYSNSR cells were treated with 0.5 μM PD0332991 and 0.2 μM SNS032, respectively for 48 h. A representative FACS image is shown for
each condition. (c) PD0332991 and SNS032 delay progression of HEY xenografts. HEY cells were injected into nude mice and treated
with vehicle (control), 50 mg/kg PD0332991 or 15mg/kg SNS032 on day 8, 12, 15, 19 and 22 after injection. The data shown represent
the mean tumor volume plus SEM (n = 6). *p = 0.04 (SNS032-treated versus control) and p = 0.0002 (PD0332991-treated versus control).

0.2 μM SNS032 or 0.02 μM dinaciclib for 48 h with subsequent RNA and protein isolation. Validation of candidate target genes by (d)
qPCR and (e) Western blot analysis are shown. (f) Biochemical changes in CDKi-resistant cells. Lysates derived from two HEY-PDR clones
(left) and two HEY-SNSR clones (right) were treated in the absence or presence of 0.2 μM SNS032 or 0.5 μM PD0332991, respectively,
for 48 h and probed with the antibodies indicated. Naïve HEY cells were included as controls. SNS032 induces TP53 protein in naïve HEY
but not in HEY-SNSR. Elevated cyclin E1 and reduced RB protein levels are present in HEY-PDR. (g) CDK2 inhibition sensitizes OVCAR3
cells to PD0332991. OVCAR3 cells were treated with 0.2 μM SNS032 in the absence or presence of 0.5 μM PD0332991. Cell viability was

are cyclin E1/CDK2-dependent, confirming earlier reports
[15]. Mechanistically, we found that PD0332991 induced
a strong G1 arrest in sensitive cell lines, as reported before
(Supplementary Fig. 1c) [9, 10]. In contrast, SNS032 and
dinaciclib induced a mixed response in most cell lines
that included G1 and G2/M arrest, as well as apoptosis
(Supplemental Fig. 1c). Thus, whereas ovarian cancer cell
lines can be clearly segregated into PD0332991-sensitive
and resistant lines, IC50 values for current CDK2 inhibitors
show a continuum within a narrow dose range that may
be the result of non-cell cycle CDKs affected by SNS032
(CDK9) and dinaciclib (CDK5, 9). In order to study the
effects of CDK2 inhibition on the cell cycle we therefore
chose drug concentrations that induced cell cycle arrest
but no apoptosis in the most resistant cell lines within 48 h
(0.2 μM SNS032 and 0.02 μM dinaciclib).
Next, we compared the molecular effects of
PD0332991 and SNS032 in the cell line HEY (RB1
wildtype, CCNE1 wildtype) since it was the most
sensitive cell line in our panel for all three CDKi
(Fig. 1a). Further validation of the efficacy of CDKi in
this cell line was obtained by flow cytometry: Exposure of
HEY cells to SNS032 or PD0332991 for 48 h drastically
reduced the number of cells in S phase, as determined by
BrdU incorporation assay (Fig. 1b, upper). Moreover, in
subcutaneous HEY xenografts, treatment with SNS032
or PD0332991 delayed tumor progression compared
to controls (Fig. 1c). Expression profiling followed by
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) established that the
cell cycle was the most significantly affected cellular
function in CDKi-treated cells (Supplemental Fig. 1d).
IPA predicted E2F4, TP53 and E2F1 as the top regulators
affected by PD0332991, and E2F4, ERBB2 and TP53
as the top regulators affected by SNS032 (Supplemental
Fig. 1d). Established E2F target genes, such as CDK1,
CDC25C, and BRCA1, were significantly downregulated
in CDKi-treated cells (Table 1). Using RT-qPCR (qPCR),
we validated downregulation of BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK1
and CCNE1 in response to PD0332991, SNS032, and
dinaciclib (Fig. 1d). Downregulation of BRCA1 and
CDK1 was further confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1e).
In addition to known E2F target genes, SNS032 caused
downregulation of ETS family transcription factors,
including ELF2, ETV4 and ETV5 (Table 1, Fig. 1d, e).
Thus, we confirmed E2F-responsive genes as common
targets of different CDKi and identified several ETS
family members as potential cell cycle regulators affected
by CDK2 inhibition.

generated CDKi-resistant cells by isolating colonies after
several months of selection in the presence of either 0.5 μM
PD0332991 or 0.2 μM SNS032. For SNS032 selection,
resistant colonies originated from single, surviving cells
in low-density seeding conditions (500,000 cells/10 cm
plate). For PD0332991 selection, cells were repeatedly
passaged at low density until the onset of senescence
in the majority of cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b). We
previously established senescence as an endpoint of longterm PD0332991 exposure [10]. Resistant colonies that
escaped from senescence were expanded in the presence
of PD0332991 for at least ten passages prior to analysis.
Next, we tested responses of resistant cells to other
CDKi: HEY-SNSR sustained proliferation in the presence
of SNS032 (Fig. 1b, lower, Supplementary Fig. 2a)
but remained sensitive to PD0332991 (Supplementary
Fig. 2a, c). HEY-SNSR cells were also less sensitive
to dinaciclib (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In contrast,
HEY-PDR cells conferred resistance to PD0332991
but remained sensitive to SNS032 and dinaciclib
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). These results suggested different
adaptive responses in HEY-PDR and HEY-SNSR.
In order to identify the molecular differences in
adaptation we compared gene expression profiles for
HEY-PDR, HEY-SNSR cells, untreated HEY cells and
CDKi-treated HEY cells. HEY-SNSR cells had completely
restored expression of most E2F target genes and clustered
with naïve HEY cells (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1d).
Similarly, expression of ETS family genes was
comparable to that in parental cells (Table 1, right). In
contrast, PD0332991-resistant HEY cells (HEY-PDR) did
not regain their full proliferative potential in the presence
of PD0332991 (Fig. 1b, lower) and did not fully restore
E2F target gene expression (Table 1, right). On the level
of individual genes, we compared PD0332991-treated
and PD0332991-resistant cells and found that CCNE1
was significantly upregulated and RB1 was significantly
downregulated in HEY-PDR (Table 1, right) even though
expression of both genes was not significantly affected by
PD0332991 treatment of naïve HEY cells (NS in Table 1,
left). These data suggest that the observed changes were
part of the adaptive response in HEY-PDR cells.
Indeed, biochemical analysis of protein expression in
HEY-SNSR and HEY-PDR cells confirmed higher levels of
cyclin E1 and lower levels of RB protein in HEY-PDR cells
(Fig. 1f). In HEY-SNSR cells, cyclin E1 was not affected
and RB was downregulated in only one clone (Fig. 1f). In
contrast, HEY-SNSR cells, unlike naïve HEY cells, avoided
p53 protein accumulation in response to SNS032 exposure
(Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 2d). Thus, HEY-PDR and
HEY-SNSR cells acquire different molecular changes.
Further, long term exposure to PD0332991 and SNS032
in combination prevented the outgrowth of resistant cells
in both HEY and OVCAR3 cells more effectively than
single drug treatment (Fig. 1g, Supplemental Fig. 2e) but
did not enhance the acute cytotoxic response elicited by

To address if regained proliferative potential in
CDKi-resistant cells involves restoration of E2F and ETS
function, we assessed gene expression in CDKi-resistant

SNS032 (Supplementary Fig. 2f). Combined treatment
with dinaciclib and PD0332991 had a similar effect
in OVCAR3 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Thus, we
conclude that resistance to PD0332991 and SNS032
involves different mechanisms that independently restore
E2F target gene expression.

(> 0.02 μM versus < 0.01 μM in parental) and SNS032
(> 0.1 μM versus 0.05  μM in parental) than parental
OVCAR5 (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Increased expression
of both ERBB2 and cyclin E1 was found in all three
clones relative to parental controls (Supplementary
Fig. 3b). Thus, multiple concomitant de novo aberrations
drive CDKi resistance, including loss of RB1, gain of
cyclins CCNE1 and CCND2, and activation of RTK and
MYC signaling.

De novo copy number aberrations are associated
with restored E2F and ETS function
Next, we asked if we could find genetic evidence
for de novo alterations associated with CDKi resistance.
To this end, we generated CDKi-resistant cell clones
from three additional ovarian cancer cell lines. Since
virtually all HGSOC harbor TP53 mutations [2] we
chose TP53-mutant OV90 and OAW28, as well as
TP53-null SKOV3 (Supplemental Table 2). We reasoned
that combined selection with PD0332991 and SNS032
would be an effective tool to study acquired resistance
mechanisms affecting the cell cycle rather than apoptosis
because (1) in contrast to SNS032, PD0332991 has no
cytotoxic effect even at low micromolar concentrations
and may push exposed cells towards arrest rather than
death (Supplementary Fig. 1c), and (2) the addition of
PD0332991 was able to enhance long-term SNS032
efficacy even in cell lines that are inherently PD03320991resistant (e.g. OVCAR3, Fig.  1g). Thus, we generated
both SNS032-resistant and PD0332991/SNS032-resistant
sublines by selection in 0.2  μM SNS032 +/− 0.2  μM
PD0332991 for 6 months (OV90, OAW28) or 1 year
(SKOV3), resulting in polyclonal and monoclonal
CDKi-resistant sublines (Fig. 2a). The resulting cell
lines were analyzed by array-based comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH, Supplementary Table 3) and
genomic qPCR (Fig. 2b) to detect DNA copy number
changes. As predicted by our results in HEY cells, we
found genomic RB1 loss and CCNE1 gain in PD0332991selected cells (Fig. 2c, d). De novo CCNE1 gain resulted in
increased cyclin E1 protein expression in CDKi-resistant
OAW28 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
In contrast, SNS032 resistance was characterized
by de novo aberrations in the receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) signaling pathway (ERBB2, AKT3, and PIK3CA
gain) as well as gain of MYC and CCND2 (Fig. 2c, d).
Activation of RTK signaling was demonstrated by

and OV90 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Expression profiling
confirmed that these de novo aberrations were associated
with restored E2F-mediated transcription in CDKiresistant cells (Supplementary Table 4). In order to
validate these findings in an independent system we
analyzed three dinaciclib-resistant subclones of the
OVCAR5 cell line for changes in ERBB2 and cyclin
E1 expression. Dinaciclib-resistant OVCAR5 had

Cyclin E1 and ERBB2 confer resistance to CDKi
While RB1 deletion is a well-established mechanism
of resistance to PD0332991 [8–10], the role of cyclin E1
and ERBB2 in CDKi resistance has not been established
yet. Concomitant activation of ERBB2 and cyclin E1 in
both PD0332991/SNS032-selected and dinaciclib-selected
cells suggested that both drivers contribute to CDKi
resistance. We next designed functional experiments to test
the individual impact of each gene on CDKi resistance. To
study cyclin E1 in gain-of-function experiments, we chose
PD0332991-sensitive HEY cells with low endogenous
cyclin E1 expression. HEY cells were engineered to
constitutively express a cyclin E1 transgene following
retroviral transduction (HEY-CCNE1). Cells transduced
with an empty retroviral construct were used as controls
(HEY-pBABE). In luminometric viability assays,
HEY-CCNE1 cells displayed significantly increased
resistance to PD0332991 (Supplementary Fig. 2a,
pBABE versus CCNE1-1 and CCNE1-2, p = 0.03 and
p = 0.01, respectively) but not SNS032 or dinaciclib
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). We then compared HEYpBABE and HEY-CCNE1 cells in proliferation assays
(Fig. 3a) and in soft agar colony formation assays, a
surrogate of anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 3b).
Ectopic cyclin E1 expression had no proliferationenhancing effect under regular culture conditions but
conferred a significant proliferation advantage in the
presence of PD0332991 (Fig. 3a, p = 0.002). Similar
results were obtained for another PD0332991-sensitive
ovarian cancer cell line with low endogenous cyclin E1
expression, OVCA433 (Supplementary Fig. 3c). These
data indicate that overexpression of cyclin E1, while
unable to confer complete PD0332991 resistance in the
absence of additional factors (e.g. RB1 loss), is sufficient
to rescue PD0332991-induced proliferation arrest.
Indeed, in long-term colony formation assays, HEYpBABE cells underwent senescence within four weeks of
treatment under low density seeding conditions, similar
to naïve HEY cells (Supplemental Fig. 2b). In contrast,
HEY-CCNE1 cells and CCNE1-amplified OVCAR3
cells were resistant to PD0332991-induced senescence
(Supplemental Fig. 2b). In soft agar PD0332991 efficiently
suppressed colony formation in HEY-pBABE cells,
whereas ectopic cyclin E1 partially rescued PD0332991-

mediated suppression of colony formation (Fig. 3b,
p = 0.01). Taken together, these observations suggest
that overexpression of cyclin E1 as a result of ectopic
expression or amplification is sufficient to render ovarian
cancer cells resistant to PD0332991-induced proliferation
arrest.
Next, we investigated if cyclin E1 is required for
PD0332991 resistance. In PD0332991-resistant OVCAR3
(RB1 loss, CCNE1 amplification) cells, we used two
individual lentiviral shRNAs to genetically deplete cyclin
E1. Reduction of cyclin E1 RNA levels by 50 – 70%
(Fig. 3c) sensitized OVCAR3 cells to PD0332991, as
determined by luminometric viability assays (Fig. 3c, p
≤ 0.01). We performed similar experiments in cyclin E1depleted HEY and DOV13 cells (Supplemental Fig. 3d).
Cyclin E1 depletion further increased PD0332991
susceptibility in both cell lines and led to a near-complete
loss of anchorage-independent growth in the presence
of PD0332991 in HEY cells (Fig. 3d, p ≤ 0.006). These
results suggested that cyclin E1 is required for PD0332991
resistance in ovarian cancer cells and that inhibition of
cyclin E1 signaling can improve response to PD0332991.
We did not test any RB1-null cell lines in this study but
speculate that cyclin E1 may be obsolete for PD0332991
resistance in an RB1-null setting. In summary, cyclin E1
signaling confers resistance to PD0332991 in RB1proficient ovarian cancer cells.
Since activated RTK and PI3K signaling was a
common motif in CDK2 inhibitor-resistant ovarian cancer
cells, we next tested the hypothesis that constitutively
active RTK signaling could confer resistance to CDK2
inhibition. To this end, we introduced a mutant form of
ERBB2 into CCNE1-amplified OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 3e).
Overexpression of mutant ERBB2 dramatically increased
the IC50 value for SNS032 from 150.7 nM to up to 500 nM
(Fig. 3e). Moreover, OVCAR3-ERBB2mut cells were also
more resistant to dinaciclib (Supplementary Fig. 3e).
Thus, increased RTK signaling can protect TP53-deficient
cells with high cyclin E1 expression against CDK2
inhibition.

to SKOV3-SNSR-1 and 2 (profiled after one year),
SKOV3-PD/SNSR-1 (profiled after 1 year of CDKi
exposure (early), 2 years of CDKi exposure (late) and
6 months of release following 2 years of selection
(release)) and SKOV3-PD/SNSR-2 (profiled after 1 year
of CDKi exposure). SKOV3-PD/SNSR-early cells
exhibited reduced expression of some E2F target genes
(Supplementary Table 5), as well as reduced proliferation
rates (Fig. 4a) despite loss of RB1 (Fig. 2d). After
another year in selection, SKOV3-PD/SNSR-late cells
had increased expression of E2F target genes to levels
that were comparable to or above those in parental cells
(Supplementary Table 5). These expression changes
coincided with copy number gains in CCNE1 and
ERBB2 (Fig. 2d). Upon release from CDKi-induced
suppression of proliferation for 6 months, SKOV3-PD/
SNSR cells acquired a hyperproliferative phenotype
compared to parental SKOV3, suggesting that CDKiassociated de novo copy number aberrations (loss of
RB1, gain of CCNE1 and ERBB2) provided the cells
with a proliferative advantage (Fig. 4a). Biochemically,
ERBB2 signaling increased with added selection pressure
(PD0332991/SNS032 versus SNS032 alone) and time,
resulting in activation of MAPK and AKT signaling
(Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). Hyperactivation
of MAPK signaling was associated with increased
expression of ETS factors ETV4 and ETV5 (Fig. 4b, c).
ETV5 maps to chromosome 3q27-28, which is frequently
amplified in HGSOC and harbors a number of putative
oncogenes including MECOM, PIK3CA and TERC
[2]. The region gains additional copies in CDKiresistant SKOV3 (Fig. 2c). However, copy number
gains alone are insufficient to induce ETV5 RNA
as levels reverted back to baseline in SKOV3-PD/
SNSR-1 release cells (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 4b).
These results suggested a dynamic interaction between
ETS and E2F transcription factors. Given that acute
exposure to SNS032 resulted in downregulation of ETS
factors, including ETV4 and ETV5 (Fig. 1d, e, Table 1),
we next asked if E2F transcription factors are
directly involved in the regulation of ETS genes,
such as ETV5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) showed binding of E2F1 to proximal ETV5
promoter elements that was more pronounced
in CDKi-resistant SKOV3 than in parental cells
and increased over time, with the highest binding
observed in late SKOV3-PD/SNSR-1 cells (Fig. 4d).
In contrast, binding of E2F1 to the BRCA1 promoter, a
classic E2F target, showed an inverse pattern, with the
lowest binding observed in late SKOV3-PD/SNSR-1 cells
(Fig. 4d). Collectively, these data show that E2F and
ETS-mediated transcription is altered in CDKi-resistant
ovarian cancer cells, reflecting the differential activation
of different drivers of E2F-mediated transcription,
including cyclin E1 and RTK/RAS signaling. We next

ETS transcription factors are downstream
mediators of RTK/RAS signaling
In order to identify the molecular mechanisms
downstream of RTK signaling that mediate CDKi
resistance we used the SKOV3 cell line. Since SKOV3
shows intermediate sensitivity to PD0332991 (Fig. 1a),
selection with both SNS032 and PD0332991 resulted in
a prolonged state of impaired proliferation similar to what
we observed in HEY-PDR cells (Fig. 1b). This allowed us
to monitor emerging resistance over time (Supplemental
Fig. 4a). We characterized both RNA and protein
expression of several CDKi-resistant cell clones over
a course of two years, comparing parental SKOV3

asked if we could identify a similar pattern in primary
HGSOC: Since CCNE1 and KRAS are frequently
amplified in HGSOC we plotted ETV5 RNA expression
as a function of CCNE1 and KRAS DNA copy number,
using publicly available TCGA data on 489 HGSOC
tumors [2] that we accessed via the cBioPortal [22, 23].
ETV5 expression was positively correlated with KRAS
copy number and inversely correlated with CCNE1
copy number (Fig. 4e). In contrast, BRCA1 expression
showed the opposite pattern with highest expression in
CCNE1-amplified HGSOC. Thus, ETV5 and BRCA1 are
E2F target genes that are associated with different drivers
of E2F-mediated transcription (RTK/KRAS: ETV5;
CCNE1: BRCA1).
Given that E2F link proliferation and DNA repair
[24] and that BRCA1 is an important determinant of
chemosensitivity in HGSOC [25] we then considered the
possibility that CDKi may alter response to platinumbased drugs. Indeed, we found that sensitivity to
cisplatin was frequently enhanced in CDKi-resistant cells
(Supplementary Fig. 4d), coinciding with lower levels
of BRCA1 and BRCA2 RNA (Fig. 4c, Supplementary
Fig. 4e). Thus, disruption of E2F-mediated transcription
can sensitize cells to platinum-based chemotherapy.

direct target of MYC) and/or cyclin E (e.g. as a result
of CCNE1 amplification) and subsequent activation
of E2F target genes and proliferation. In parallel, ERK
activates ETS transcription factors, including ETV5,
which contribute to cell cycle progression via induction of
cell cycle genes. Genetic changes in CDKi-resistant cells
(gains in red, losses in green) affect multiple regulators
of proliferation, which collectively restore cell cycle
progression via E2F and ETS-mediated transcription.
Resistance to CDKi that induce cell death (SNS032,
dinaciclib) further requires the activation of survival
pathways such as the AKT pathway.

The CDKi, dinaciclib, sensitizes cyclin E1-driven
ovarian cancers to cisplatin
Finally, we sought to test our model of differential
cell cycle regulation in the context of ovarian cancer
therapy. We hypothesized that in cyclin E1-driven cells,
CDK2 inhibitors could be used as chemosensitizers based
on their ability to downregulate BRCA1 and other DNA
repair genes that are critical determinants of cisplatin
sensitivity (Fig. 1d, e, Supplemental Fig. 4d, e). As a
genetically defined model of cyclin E1 dependence, we
employed Trp53-null (p53 -/-) mouse ovarian surface
epithelial (MOSE) cells [26] that were transformed
by a CCNE1 transgene (MOSE-CCNE1) or mutant
HRASG12V (MOSE-HRAS). MOSE cells infected with
empty pBABE vector were used as controls (Fig. 6a).
We verified increased expression of Etv4 and Etv5 in
MOSE-HRAS cells (Fig. 6b), suggesting that this model
recapitulated the differences we observed in CCNE1 and
RTK/RAS-driven ovarian cancers. In MOSE-CCNE1
cells, dinaciclib had a dramatic effect on cisplatin
sensitivity (Fig. 6c, Supplementary Fig. 5a), decreasing
the IC50 from 165.0 μM to 32.9 μM. In contrast, MOSEHRAS cells were not sensitized by dinaciclib. Indeed,
drug combination studies confirmed that dinaciclib and
cisplatin act synergistically in MOSE-CCNE1 cells but
not in MOSE-HRAS cells (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
Similarly, in human ovarian cancer cell lines with high
endogenous cyclin E1, OVCAR3, OVCAR4 and OAW28
(Supplementary Fig. 1a), a single low dose of dinaciclib
significantly reduced the number of cisplatin-surviving
colonies (Fig. 6d, Supplementary Fig. 5c), whereas in
SKOV3 cells with high endogenous ERBB2 and low
cyclin E1 (Supplementary Fig. 1a), dinaciclib had no added
effect on chemosensitivity. We then proceeded to test the
combination in vivo: established OVCAR3 xenografts were
randomized into four treatment groups and treated with
vehicle, dinaciclib alone, cisplatin alone, or a combination
of cisplatin and dinaciclib (Fig. 6e). The combination
significantly delayed progression and increased survival
compared to either single treatment group (Fig. 6e, f). In
conclusion, dinaciclib can be a potent chemosensitizer in
cyclin E1-dependent ovarian cancer cells.

ETV5 regulates cell cycle genes and contributes
to tumorigenicity
Mechanistically, these data suggested that ETV5
expression is regulated by E2F. Since some E2F targets,
such as CCNE1, also induce E2F activity as part of a
positive feedback loop, we next asked if ETV5 contributes
to cell cycle gene expression in a similar manner. In order
to test if ETV5 is required for the expression of E2F
targets in RAS-driven ovarian cancer cells we revisited the
HEY cell line, which carries a KRASG12D mutation, as well
as gain of the KRAS gene. We generated HEY subclones
with inducible knockdown of ETV5 by lentiviral infection
with pTRIPZ-shETV5 and compared gene expression
in doxycycline-induced cells and uninduced cells, as
well as HEY cells carrying a shGFP control hairpin
(Fig. 5a). Genetic depletion of ETV5 resulted in reduced
expression of CCND2 and PLK2, indicating that ETV5 is
required for the expression of cell cycle genes (Fig. 5a).
Transient depletion of ETV4 and ETV5 in ERBB2amplified SKOV3 cells and OV90-PD/SNSR cells,
which have CCND2 copy number gain (Fig. 2c), showed
similar results (Fig. 5b, c). Soft agar colony formation
assays further demonstrated that ETV5 is required for
tumorigenicity in HEY cells. ETV5 RNA depletion
significantly reduced colony number (Fig. 5d, p = 0.0004).
Collectively, our data support a model where E2F and
ETS transcription factors cooperate to drive cell cycle
gene expression (Fig. 5e): Drivers of HGSOC activate
several signaling cascades that result in expression of
cyclin D (downstream of KRAS-ERK signaling and a

DISCUSSION

the pathway were observed, resulting in activation of both
the MAPK signaling cascade, an inducer of proliferation
via cyclin D, as well as AKT signaling, generally
considered a survival pathway. In addition to cyclin
D, MAPK signaling induces ETS transcription factors
via activation of ERK, which results in transcriptional
upregulation of ETS factors and post-translational
modification of ETS proteins by phosphorylation (reviewed
in [36]). We identified the ETS member ETV5 as a critical
downstream effector of MAPK signaling in ovarian cancer
cells. In MAPK-dependent ovarian cancer cells, ETV5 is
both induced by E2F and required for the expression of
cell cycle genes, such as CCND2 and PLK2. Thus, genetic
events, such as CCND2 copy number gain, cooperate with
increased ETV5 activity to drive expression of cyclin D2
when cyclin E-CDK2 activity is chronically inhibited.
Importantly, our findings are not limited to CDKiresistant cell lines but apply to primary HGSOC. Analysis
of TCGA data revealed that ETV5 is highly expressed in
KRAS-amplified HGSOC and low in CCNE1-amplified
HGSOC, possibly reflecting a differential requirement of
ETV5 in subgroups of HGSOC. Interestingly, ETV5 is also
frequently amplified in HGSOC as part of a large genomic
region on chromosome 3q26-28 which also harbors
MECOM, PIK3CA, and TERC. In CDK2 inhibitor-resistant
cells, we found gain of this region, suggesting that both
PIK3CA and ETV5 may contribute to CDK2i resistance.
Collectively, a picture emerges in which E2F target gene
expression is controlled by multiple oncogenic pathways
downstream of signature genomic aberrations of HGSOC,
including CCNE1 amplification, loss or deletion of RB1, as
well as amplification of MYC and KRAS. The capacity of
these pathways to functionally compensate for each other,
in addition to the genomic complexity of HGSOC where
multiple events among E2F regulators frequently occur
(e.g. co-amplification of CCNE1 and KRAS), will likely
exacerbate the identification of responder populations for
individual CDKi. Moreover, our data suggest that E2F
and ETS transcription factors coordinately regulate cell
cycle progression and cross-regulate each other. Similar
to cyclin E1, ETV5 is both induced by E2F during cell
cycle progression and required for the expression of a
subset of cell cycle genes. The inverse correlation between
CCNE1 and ETV5 expression may be indicative of a
negative feedback mechanism - similar to E2F-mediated
suppression of CCND1 in late G1 - or may merely reflect
the relative enrichment of different cell cycle phases in
CCNE1-driven versus KRAS-driven tumors.
Given the vast potential for resistance as a result
of genomic complexity is there a use for CDKi in the
treatment of HGSOC? Due to the high prevalence of
CCNE1 gain/amplification and RB1 loss, mutation or
deletion, palbociclib is expected to be ineffective in the
majority of primary HGSOC but may be selectively
applied in cyclin E1-low, RB1-proficient cancers [9], or as

Signaling by cyclin-CDK complexes via RB and
E2F activates E2F target gene expression, which can
be inhibited by pharmacological CDK inhibitors. CDK
inhibitors have entered late stage clinical trials for some
human cancers but could have the potential for broader
applicability due to near-universal genetic RB pathway
aberrations found across many different cancer types
[6]. However, mouse knockout models have elegantly
demonstrated that genetic deletion of individual interphase
CDKs has relatively little effect on organismal viability
in general and cell cycle progression specifically [27–29].
For example, CDK2-/- mice are viable [30], and silencing
of CDK2 had no significant impact on proliferation in
some cancer cells [31]. In contrast, CDK2/4 double
knockout results in embryonic lethality [32]. Using
ovarian cancer as a model system, we have compared
directly the acute effect of selective CDK4/6 inhibition
(PD0332991 = palbociclib) or CDK2 inhibition (SNS032,
dinaciclib), as well as mechanisms of resistance. Our
data suggest that ovarian cancer cells adapt to CDK
inhibition by acquiring, or selecting for, multiple de novo
copy number aberrations that are upstream of cyclin D
or cyclin E: Copy number gain and overexpression
of CCNE1, as well as loss of RB1, was observed in
PD0332991-resistant cells, and experimental modulation
of cyclin E1 expression altered PD0332991 sensitivity,
whereby overexpression of cyclin E1 conferred resistance
to CDK4/6 inhibition, whereas genetic depletion of cyclin
E1 increased sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. In line with
this, combined inhibition of CDK2/4/6 by PD0332991
and SNS032 prevented the formation of CDKi-resistant
colonies in vitro. However, this combination may not be
suitable in vivo, due to inherent functional antagonism
and general toxicity: CDK4/6 inhibition results in G1 cell
cycle arrest and is cytostatic in most systems whereas
CDK1/2 inhibition leads to apoptosis, as shown by our
data and published studies [33, 34]. These two opposing
mechanisms may prevent effective tumor regression in
vivo [35] and may explain the failure of earlier pan-CDKi,
such as Flavopiridol, in the clinic.
Resistance to CDK2 inhibitors appears to be more
complicated and involves multiple genetic changes,
possibly because both SNS032 and dinaciclib inhibit other
non-cell cycle CDK, such as CDK5 and CDK9, inducing
both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, CDK2
inhibitor resistance requires the activation of survival
pathways in addition to restoration of proliferative potential
whereas PD0332991 resistance does not. A common theme
observed in all CDK2 inhibitor-resistant cell lines was the
selection for inducers of cyclin D signaling, such as MYC,
CCND2, and RTK signaling. Within the RTK signaling
network, we observed gain of ERBB2, PIK3CA and AKT3.
In each CDKi-resistant cell line, several de novo changes in

follow-up treatment in CDK2 inhibitor-resistant cancers.
Our data suggest that combination with RTK inhibitors
or MAPK inhibitors may be effective, as shown in other
cancers [37]. In contrast, CDK2 inhibitors, such as
dinaciclib, may be most effective as chemosensitizers in
cyclin E1-driven HGSOC, including CCNE1-amplified
tumors. CCNE1-amplified HGSOC comprise 20% of
all HGSOC and lack mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2
[2]. BRCA-mutant cancers are associated with improved
overall survival, in large part due to the increased platinum
sensitivity as a result of compromised homologous
recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair function [38,
39]. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are also known E2F targets
[40] and overexpressed in CCNE1-amplified HGSOC
[25, 41] which require intact BRCA1 function [41].
Inhibition of CDK1/2 by SNS032 or dinaciclib resulted
in downregulation of BRCA1 and chemosensitization
specifically in cyclin E1-driven cells. In summary, these
findings may help to incorporate CDKi into rational
therapeutic combinations in a subset of the most difficult
to treat tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR)

Cell culture and reagents

Total RNA isolation, cDNA generation and qPCR
were performed as previously described [43]. Primer
sequences used for qPCR were obtained from SAB
Biosciences (Valencia, CA; Supplemental Information).

Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines CAOV3,
OVCAR3, OV90 and SKOV3 were obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, VA). OVCAR4 cells were purchased from
NCI (Frederick, MD). OVCAR5, OAW28, HEY and
DOV13 were kindly provided by Dr. D. J. Slamon (Los
Angeles, CA). OVCA420 and OVCA433 were kindly
provided by Dr. R. Drapkin (Boston, MA). Resistant cells
were maintained in 0.5  μM PD0332991 (PD0332991resistant, PDR), 0.2  μM SNS032 (SNS032-resistant,
SNSR), 0.2 μM PD0332991/0.2μM SNS032 (PD0332991/
SNS032-resistant, PD/SNSR) or 0.02  μM dinaciclib
(dinaciclib-resistant, DinaR). STR profiling was used to
authenticate each cell line (Laragen, Culver City, CA).
Cells were maintained in DMEM (MediaTech, Manassas,
VA) supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotic-antimycotic
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and 2.5  μg/ml
plasmocin (Invivogen, San Diego, CA). Cell lines were
cultured at 37ºC and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.
The following CDK inhibitors were used: PD0332991,
SNS032 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) and dinaciclib
(MedKoo Biosciences, Chapel Hill, NC). Cisplatin was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Antibody arrays
Parental and CDKi-resistant cells were treated
with the indicated CDKi and cell lysates incubated with
phospho-kinase or phospho-MAPK profiler antibody
arrays (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After washing,
the membranes were incubated with a cocktail of
biotinylated antibodies and streptavidin–HRP according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems). Proteins
were detected using chemiluminescence.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP assay was performed on naïve SKOV3,
SKOV3-PD/SNSR-1 early, and SKOV3-PD/SNSR-1
late cells using the SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin
IP Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Cell
Signaling). Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1%
formaldehyde in culture medium at room temperature
for 10 minutes. An aliquot to serve as input DNA was
set aside. After quenching with glycine and subsequent
washes, chromatin was digested by micrococcal nuclease
and sonication. Sheared chromatin-protein complexes
were incubated with antibodies against IgG and E2F1
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4°C. Complexes

Plasmids, lentiviral constructs and siRNA
Cyclin E1 cDNA (Addgene, Cambridge, MA,
[42]) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector
pBABE-puro (Addgene) at the EcoRI site to generate
pBABE-CCNE1. Target cells (HEY, and OVCA433)

were immunoprecipitated using ChIP grade Protein G
Magnetic Beads. After washes, DNA was eluted from the
beads by incubation for 30 minutes at 65°C. Cross-links
were reversed by incubation with Proteinase K overnight
at 65°C. DNA was purified using spin columns. ChIP
DNA was then subjected to qPCR using promoter primers
for BRCA1, BRCA2, CCND1, and ETV5 (SA Biosciences;
Supplemental Information) and the iQ SYBR-Green
Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The qPCR reaction
was performed using the CFX96 Real-Time System
(BioRad).

San Jose, CA). Briefly, samples were labeled with BrdU
(Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 2 h, washed
with PBS then fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol. After an
overnight incubation at 4°C, the cells were treated with
2 N HCl/0.5%Triton X100 then treated with borate
neutralizing solution. BrdU-labeled cells were detected
with anti-BrdU (BD Biosciences) and FITC-labeled
secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA). Cells were subsequently treated with PI (SigmaAldrich) and RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were
analyzed for BrdU/PI incorporation with a Becton
Dickinson FACScan (Franklin Lakes, NJ) using CellQuest
version 3.1 software (BD Biosciences) to gate G1, S and
G2-M cells. The results generated were from multiple
independent experiments performed in triplicate. A total
of 10,000 events were collected for final analysis.

Proliferation assays
To assay viability, cells (1 × 103 per well) were
plated in 96-well plates. After an overnight incubation,
cells were harvested at 0 h (T0) using a luminometric
assay performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, Promega,
Madison, WI) or harvested after treatment with SNS032,
PD0332991, dinaciclib or cisplatin for the indicated times
and concentrations. Luminescence was measured on a
Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner BioSystems,
Sunnyvale, CA) after 15 min. Relative viability was
calculated as reported before [10]. IC50 values were
determined using GraphPad Prism version 5 software
(San Diego, CA). Proliferation rate was determined by
seeding and harvesting cells at T0 exactly as described
above with subsequent harvests performed daily for five
consecutive days or after 6d (T6). Proliferation rate was
also determined by seeding 5 × 105 cells per 100-mm
(T0) followed by hemocytometer cell counting after 4-6d.
Seeding of cells and cell counting were repeated at regular
intervals for up to 14 d. Cell viability was also assayed
by crystal violet staining. Briefly, cells (5 × 105 per 100mm plate or 1 × 105 per 60-mm plate) were seeded and
treated as indicated. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde,
washed and subsequently stained with 0.1% crystal
violet. Quantitation was performed by extracting the
crystal violet dye with 10% acetic acid and measuring the
absorbance at 550 nm on an Ultramark EX Microplate
spectrophotometer (BioRad). Anchorage-independent
cell proliferation was determined by soft agar assay as
previously described [10]. At least two independent
experiments were performed in triplicate for each cell line
for all proliferation assays.

Senescence β-galactosidase staining
Cells (5 × 105) were plated into 10 cm tissue culture
plates and treated with PD0332991 for 4 weeks while
being passaged repeatedly. Cellular senescence was
assessed using the Senescence β-galactosidase staining kit
as per manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Signaling).

Array CGH
Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy
Tissue Kit as per manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). Pooled female genomic DNA (Promega,
Madison, WI) was differentially labeled as a control
sample. Hybridization was performed on 135,000
oligonucleotide arrays (Roche-Nimblegen, Madison, WI)
with an average probe spacing every 35 kb according to
manufacturer’s recommendations. Arrays were imaged
using a Genepix 4000B Scanner with GenePixPro software
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and data was
analyzed with the NimbleScan and Genoglyphix software
(Roche-Nimblegen). Variants were defined as segments that
have at least 5 probes and a minimum log ratio of 0.3, 200
probes and a log ratio of 0.2 or 500 probes and a log ratio
of 0.1. Variants were compared against public databases,
including the Database of Genomic Variants (The Hospital
for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) and the Copy Number
Variation Project at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
to benign population variants. Polyclonal populations of
naïve and CDKi-resistant cells were analyzed.

Flow cytometry

Microarray gene expression profiling

Cells (5 × 105) were plated into 100-mm tissue
culture plates. After an overnight incubation SNS032,
PD0332991 and dinaciclib were added at the indicated
concentrations and samples were harvested 48 h posttreatment. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow
cytometry after BrdU incorporation and propidium iodide
(PI) staining using standard methods (BD Biosciences,

Total RNA samples were assessed for concentration using Thermo Scientific’s NanoDrop 8000
Spectrophotometer (Carlsbad, CA) and degradation using
the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit with the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA). 250 ng of total RNA
was amplified and biotinylated with Ambion’s Illumina®

or vehicle. Tumors were measured by caliper at regular
intervals and tumor volume was calculated using the
formula (W)2 × L/2. Mice were maintained and euthanized
according to IACUC guidelines.

Statistical analysis

Microarray data normalization and analysis

Data were analyzed using a Student’s t-test.

47,231 probes were queried on microarray. Raw
intensities were quantile-normalized with background
subtraction, no imputation of data of missing beads. To
minimize the effect of background noise on calculations,
a floor or threshold was established so that all raw probe
intensities below the median array intensity value of 11 were
increased to 11. 10,989 probes that were not significantly
expressed over background (p-value > 0.05) for all samples
were removed from further analysis. 170 additional
probes without gene names were removed (cDNA clones
and “hypothetical” mRNAs). Significantly differentially
expressed genes were identified using a Wilcoxon t-test
between groups of samples and a minimum of +/− 1.4 fold
change between groups. q-value’s were calculated using the
method of Benjamini and Hochberg [44].

Supervised hierarchical clustering

REFERENCES

A known E2F target gene list was used to evaluate the
samples for gene regulation. In order to look for coordinated
E2F gene regulation, the samples and the gene intensities
of the (80 unique gene IDs, 117 probes) 80 E2F genes were
subjected to two-way hierarchical clustering. All gene
expression data were log2 transformed. A distance matrix
using Pearson correlations was generated with both samples
and genes and used to plot gene and sample dendrograms
representing the correlation or distance between samples
and genes. The heat map was generated using Z-scores to
better visualize differential gene expression using gplots
package (gplots version 2.12.1) in R version 3.0.2.
