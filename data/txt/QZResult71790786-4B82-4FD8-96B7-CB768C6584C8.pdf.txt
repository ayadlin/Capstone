Abstract
The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFIR) and HER2
display important signaling interactions in breast cancer. We
examined the effect of combinations of antagonists of these
receptors using two human breast cancer cell lines: BT474
(HER2+, IGFIR low) and MCF7 (HER2 low, IGFIR high). In
BT474 cells, growth was inhibited by HER2 antagonists but not
by IGFIR antagonists; however, IGFIR antagonists enhanced
the effect of HER2 inhibitors. In MCF7 cells, growth was
inhibited by IGFIR antagonists but not by HER2 antagonists;
however, HER2 antagonism enhanced the effect of IGFIR
inhibitors. Synergistic inhibition of soft agar growth was also
observed. Although HER2 and IGFIR antagonists individually
only minimally affected cell cycle, their combination gave
a small enhancement of their effects. No single receptortargeting drug was capable of inducing apoptosis, but
combining antagonists of both receptors induced a dramatic
degree of apoptosis in both cell lines. Induction of apoptosis
was most striking in MCF7 cells using a Herceptin/IGFIR
antagonist combination despite these cells being HER2 nonoverexpressing. Toward understanding the mechanism of
these effects, we detected coassociation IGFIR and HER2 in
both cell lines. Specific inhibitors of one of these receptors
could cross-inhibit the activity of the other. Targeting both
receptors gave the maximal inhibition of their downstream
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT signaling
pathways. Hence, such drug combinations may be clinically
useful and may be beneficial even in tumors in which single
drugs are inactive, as exemplified by the effect of the HER2/
IGFIR inhibitor combination in HER2 nonoverexpressing
MCF7 cells. [Cancer Res 2008;68(5):1538–45]

Introduction
HER2, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in 20% to 25%
of breast cancers, and its overexpression is associated with poor
prognosis ( for review see refs. 1, 2). HER2 is a validated therapeutic
target in breast cancer. Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a humanized
monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the extracellular domain of
HER2 that has significant therapeutic benefit in the treatment of
patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Targeted therapies have taken center stage in treatment of malignancy. Further

progress in treating solid tumors is likely to come from the use of
wisely chosen combinations of targeted therapeutics.
Recent studies have shown interactions between insulin-like
growth factor I receptor (IGFIR) signaling and HER2. In addition,
signaling by IGFIR has been linked to resistance to Herceptin.
When SKBR3 cells, which possess low levels of IGFIR, are
transfected with IGFIR and cultured with insulin-like growth
factor I (IGF-I), they become resistant to growth inhibition by
Herceptin (3). Using HER2-transfected MCF7 cells, this group
showed synergistic inhibition of anchorage-independent growth
when combining Herceptin with inducible dominant-negative
IGFIR (4); effects on apoptosis or other aspects of the transformed
phenotype were not examined. This group also showed that an
IGFIR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), AG1024, and the EGFR TKI
Iressa gave additive-to-synergistic growth inhibition of several
breast carcinoma cell lines, and the combination gave greater
apoptosis than either single agent (5). Other work has used SKBR3
cells cultured for resistance to Herceptin by continuous maintenance in the presence of Herceptin (6); this work used pools of
such resistant cells, and comparisons were made to parental
SKBR3 cells. An intimate IGFIR/HER2 interaction was noted
exclusively in the resistant pools but not in the parental cells. IGFIR
and HER2 could be coimmunoprecipitated from the resistant cells
but not from the parentals. Other findings included IGFI-induced
stimulation of HER2 phosphorylation and decreased HER2
phosphorylation when IGFIR was inhibited but again only in the
resistant cells. Inhibiting IGFIR restored sensitivity to Herceptin.
Subsequent work by the same group showed that the EGFR/HER2
dual TKI lapatinib could induce killing of the Herceptin-resistant
SKBR3 cells, and that an IGFIR antagonistic antibody could
potentiate this effect (7). Association of IGFIR with clinical
resistance to Herceptin has also been reported (8).
Evidence has shown that IGFIR signaling is necessary for
cellular transformation by a variety of agents (9, 10). Such a
critical role of IGF signaling in malignancy makes it a promising
therapeutic target in treatment of cancer. Targeting the IGFIR is a
promising strategy particularly for breast cancer because of its
overactivation in this disease, its critical role in transformation in
general (particularly its antiapoptotic function), and its intimate
cross-talk with both estrogen receptor and HER2. As a solo
therapy, IGFIR inhibition has not uniformly displayed in vivo
antitumor activity (11). However, the critical antiapoptotic role in
established tumors makes IGFIR targeting an especially promising
strategy to combine with other therapies, including conventional
chemotherapy, or, in what may be an even more appealing
strategy, with other targeted therapies. Given the interactions of
IGFIR with HER2 and the established success of targeting HER2 in
breast cancer, we aimed to explore the effect of co-targeting IGFIR
concomitantly with HER2.

Co-Targeting IGFR1 and HER2

Materials and Methods
Drugs. Herceptin was obtained from the Yale Cancer Center Medical
Oncology pharmacy. A 20 mg/mL stock preparation was kept at 4jC and
was further diluted in sterile PBS before addition to cells in culture. a-IR3
(anti-IGFIR antagonistic antibody), AG1024 (IGFIR-specific TKI), and AG825
(HER2-specific TKI) were purchased from Calbiochem. All TKIs were
dissolved in DMSO to make 10 mmol/L stock solutions.
Antibodies. Primary antibodies were purchased from the following
sources: anti-HER2/neu polyclonal antibody sc-284 and anti-IGFIR polyclonal antibody (clone C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.; anti–phospho-HER-2/neu mAb (Tyr-1248; clone PN2A) and anti–
phospho-IGFIR were from NeoMarkers and Biosource International, Inc.,
respectively; rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-AKT, AKT,
phospho–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, ERK1/2, and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were all from Cell Signaling Technology; and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated Goat anti-rabbit IgG or
goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Cell culture. Two ER+ human breast cancer cell lines that differ in their
HER2 expression level were chosen for these studies. BT-474 highly
overexpresses HER2 in association with gene amplification, whereas
MCF7 expresses a low level (nonoverexpressed) of HER2. BT474 cells,
obtained from American Type Culture Collection, were cultured in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heat inactivated),
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10 Ag/mL insulin, and penicillin at 37jC in 5% CO2
humidified air. MCF7 cells, a gift from Marc Lippman (University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), were maintained in phenol red–free Iscove’s
Modified Medium (IMEM) with 10% charcoal-stripped FCS (Biosource),
1 nmol/L estradiol added back, and penicillin, at 37jC in 5% CO2 humidified
air. To maintain the estrogen sensitivity of MCF7 cells, before each
experiment cells are cultured for 5 days in estrogen-free medium (culture
medium without the estradiol). Estradiol is then added back, with or
without drugs, at the beginning of each experiment.
WST-1 colorimetric growth assay. BT-474 and MCF7 cells were plated
in 96-well plates at a density of 104 and 103 cells per well, respectively. They
were allowed to adhere overnight and then treated with drugs the following
day (day 0). After a 5-day (BT474 cells) or 6-day (MCF7 cells) incubation
period, the WST-1 tetrazolium salt colorimetric growth assay (Boehringer
Mannheim Biochemicals) was performed by adding 1/10 volume of WST-1
solution and incubating for 2 h at 37jC. Absorbance at 450 nm was
determined using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.). A reading
was always taken at day 0 and subtracted from the 5- or 6-day reading.
Results were expressed as a percentage of control (vehicle-treated cells).
The mean and SD values of four or more wells in at least three experiments
for each point were reported.
Soft agar colony growth assay. To prepare base plates, for BT474,
1 mL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
10 Ag/mL insulin, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 0.8% agarose was added into each
35-mm dish. For MCF7, 1 mL IMEM containing 10% charcoal stripped FCS,
1 nmol/L estradiol, and 0.8% agarose was added into each 35-mm dish. The
dishes were placed at 4jC to solidify the agarose and then transferred to a
37jC incubator. Cells were mixed with their respective medium in the
presence of 10 Amol/L AG1024, 1 Ag/mL Herceptin ( for BT474) or 10 Ag/mL
Herceptin ( for MCF7), both drugs, no drug (‘‘control’’), or vehicle then
plated on top of the base at a density of 2  104 cells per 35-mm dish for
BT474 and 1  102 for MCF7, in triplicate. Dishes were incubated at 37jC
for 21 days. Clusters of greater than or equal to six cells were scored as
colonies, and single cells as well as clusters of fewer than six cells were
scored as single cells. Five microscopic fields (60) of each dish were
scored, and the colony formation percentage of each dish was calculated
by dividing the number of colonies by the total of colonies plus single
cells. Final results were expressed as the percentage of untreated (‘‘control’’)
cells.
Analysis of cell cycle by flow cytometry. Cells in exponential growth
were seeded at a confluency of f50% in 100-mm dishes. After overnight
incubation, cells were treated either with vehicle or drugs. At indicated time
points, cells were trypsinized, washed with cold PBS, resuspended in 2 mL

www.aacrjournals.org

of ice cold PBS, and fixed by three stepwise additions of 2 mL each of 95%
ethanol (12). After fixation for at least 1 h, cells were resuspended in 1 mg/
mL RNase (Sigma) in PBS and stained with 0.05 mg/mL propidium iodide
(Sigma) for 1 h on ice. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACS
Vantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). A minimum of 15,000 cells was
analyzed for each sample. Data analysis was performed using Modfit 5.2
analysis software (Verity Software House). Each point represents duplicate
samples from at least three experiments.
Apoptosis determination by sub-G1 analysis. Cells in exponential
growth were seeded at a confluency of 50% in 100-mm dishes. After
incubation for an indicated period of time with drug, both adherent and
nonadherent cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in icecold 70% ethanol at least for 1 h. Cells were centrifuged and washed twice
with cold PBS, resuspended in 1 mg/mL RNase (Sigma Co.), and stained
with 0.05 mg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma Co.) for 1 h on ice in the dark.
Analysis of cellular DNA and hypodiploid DNA content indicative of
apoptotic DNA fragmentation was determined by collecting 10,000 events
using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer and Cell Quest Software (Becton
Dickinson). Cell debris and small particles were excluded from the analysis
by forward/sideward scatter criteria (13).
Apoptosis determination by Annexin V assay. After 5 to 6 days of
drug treatment, both adherent and nonadherent cells were harvested and
stained using Vybrant Apoptosis Assay kit #2 (Molecular Probes). Briefly,
the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 Annexin V and propidium
iodide in 1 Annexin-Binding Buffer (provided with the kit) for 15 min at
room temperature. The percentages of Annexin V– and propidium iodide–
positive cells were determined by flow cytometry, and any necrotic cells
(stained with both propidium iodide and FITC) were gated out so that an
accurate determination of the percentage of apoptotic cells could be
made.
Apoptosis determination by PARP cleavage analysis. MCF7 and
BT474 cell lysates were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100,
1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L h-glycerol
phosphate, 25 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Ag/mL Leupeptin, 10 Ag/mL Aprotinin, and
5 Ag/mL Pepstatin]. The lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation
(13,000  g; 20 min; 4jC). Extracts (40 Ag protein per lane) were
immunoblotted with anti-PARP polyclonal antibody (1:1,000 in Trisbuffered saline/Tween) for 1 h followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated
with HRP (Santa Cruz; 1:1,000 dilution; 60 min). Bands were visualized
with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech) on X-ray film (Eastman Kodak).
Immunoblot analysis for phospho-IGFIR, total IGFIR, phosphoHER2, total HER2, phospho-AKT, total AKT, phospho-ERK-1/2, and
total ERK-1/2. Cells lysates were prepared as above. MCF7 and BT474 cell
extract (40 Ag protein per lane) were immunoblotted with the primary
antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween for o/n at
4jC followed by 1 h with HRP-conjugated respective secondary antibody
(1:1,000 dilution). Bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on X-ray film (Eastman
Kodak). h-actin was used for loading control.
Coimmunoprecipitation of IGFIRB and HER2. Cell lysates prepared as
above were precleared with protein A/G agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) then immunoprecipitated with either anti-HER2 (mouse mAb; 9G6;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-IGFIRh (rabbit polyclonal antibody;
C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies overnight at 4jC. In some
experiments, rabbit or mouse IgG were used for immunoprecipitation
instead as negative controls. Immunoprecipitates were washed thrice with
lysis buffer, mixed with electrophoresis sample buffer, heated, and subjected
to electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresed
proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were
immunoblotted with anti-IGFIRh (rabbit polyclonal C20; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or anti-HER2 antibodies (rabbit polyclonal; sc-284; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Detection was with HRP-coupled antibodies to rabbit
IgG using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Results
Expression of IGFIR in BT474 and MCF7 cells. A comparison
of relative IGFIR expression levels between BT474 and MCF7 cells
was performed by analyzing equivalent amounts of protein from
cell lysates of each line in an anti-IGFIR immunoblot experiment
as described in Materials and Methods. We found that both lines
express IGFIR, with relatively high levels observed in MCF7 cells
and comparably low levels in BT474 cells (data not shown). These
results are consistent with previously published reports.
Effect of IGFIR inhibitors alone and in combination with
HER2 antagonists on cell growth. Dose-response curves for the
effect on cell proliferation were generated for antagonists of IGFIR
and HER2. Using BT474 cells, we found little or no growth
inhibition from the IGFIR antagonists a-IR3 or AG1024, whereas
growth was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by inhibitors of
HER2 (Herceptin and AG825; Fig. 1A–D). However, the addition
of IGFIR antagonists significantly enhanced the growth inhibition
observed with Herceptin or AG825, although the IGFIR inhibitors
were used at concentrations showing no growth inhibition at all
as single agents (Fig. 1E–H).

Using MCF7 cells, which do not have HER2 overexpression but
express high levels of IGFIR, growth is inhibited by the IGFIR
antagonists AG1024 and a-IR3 but, as expected, not by the HER2
antagonists Herceptin or AG825 (Fig. 2A–D). When combinations
were examined, although the single agents Herceptin and AG825
had no growth inhibitory activity, they enhanced the growth
inhibition elicited by the IGFIR antagonists a-IR3 or AG1024
(Fig. 2E and F).
Effect on anchorage-independent clonogenicity. The effect of
the presence of AG1024, Herceptin, and the combination on the
soft agar colony growth was analyzed. For these experiments, drug
was present continuously during colony growth as described in
Materials and Methods. Results are expressed as a percentage of
control (no drugs or vehicles added). For BT474 cells, 10 Amol/L
AG1024 was without effect, whereas 1 Amol/L Herceptin resulted
in 68% F 8% (mean F SD) of control number of colonies; the
combination resulted in 37% F 5% of control. For MCF7 cells,
10 Ag/mL Herceptin had no effect, whereas 10 Amol/L AG1024
resulted in 82% F 9% of control number of colonies, and the
combination resulted in 41% F 3% of control.

a-IR3 (1 Ag/mL) and AG1024 (10 Amol/L)
were combined with either Herceptin

indicated doses (A–D ). IGFIR antagonists
a-IR3 (1 Ag/mL) and AG1024 (5 Amol/L) were
combined with HER2 inhibitors, Herceptin
(Her ) or AG825 (E and F ), as indicated. After
6 d of incubation, the WST-1 proliferation assay
was performed as described in Materials and

percentage of control (V, vehicle-treated cells).
Columns, mean of four or more wells from at
least three experiments for each point; bars,

Effect on cell cycle. In general, inhibition of growth factor
receptor tyrosine kinases such as HER2 effects cell cycle by
inducing G1 arrest and/or reducing percentage of cells in S phase.
Effects on cell cycle were examined after 24 to 48 h of drug
treatment with similar results at both time points. Results are
shown for 48 h treatment. In BT474, we found that Herceptin
increased the percentage of cells in G1 phase and decreased the
percentage in S phase (Fig. 3A). IGFIR antagonists exert similar
effects and slightly augment the effects of HER2 antagonists
(Fig. 3A). In MCF7 cells, HER2 and IGFIR antagonists individually
caused minimal increase in percentage cells in G1 and decrease in
percentage of cells in S phase, and their combinations caused a
small enhancement of these effects (Fig. 3B).
Induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis was assayed after 5 to 6 days
of drug treatment by analyzing the percentage of cells in the sub-G1
peak (Fig. 4A and B), by the Annexin-V apoptosis assay (Fig. 4C
and D), and by the PARP cleavage assay (Fig. 4E and F). Although
antagonists of HER2 did not induce apoptosis in BT474 cells, they
dramatically enhanced the otherwise minimal level of apoptosis
induced by IGFIR antagonists (Fig. 4A and C). Similarly, in MCF7

www.aacrjournals.org

cells, minimal apoptosis is induced by any single drug. However,
massive induction of apoptosis was observed with the combination
of IGFIR inhibitor plus HER2 inhibitor, especially with Herceptin
(Fig. 4B and D). This is particularly remarkable because this cell
line does not overexpress HER2 or respond at all to single agent
Herceptin.
These results were confirmed by the PARP cleavage assay
(Fig. 4E and F). For both cell lines [BT474 (Fig. 4E); MCF7 (Fig. 4F)],
individual agents do not produce a significant amount of PARP
cleavage product (89 kDa), but an increase in PARP cleavage is
observed for the drug combinations.
Cross talk between HER2 and IGFIR. Using either BT474 or
MCF7, a physical association between HER2 and IGFIR was
detectable by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5A).
In BT474, single drugs or combinations did not affect HER2
levels over a 2-day exposure. However, the inhibition of HER2
phosphorylation resulting from treatment with HER2 antagonsists was significantly augmented by IGFIR antagonists (Fig. 5B).
This experiment suggests that IGFIR contributes to HER2
signaling, and HER2 signaling can be more completely inhibited

by combining Herceptin with an IGFIR inhibitor, even in breast
carcinoma cells that have not been cultivated for acquired Herceptin
resistance.
Similarly, although to a lesser degree, maximal inhibition of
IGFIR phosphorylation was noted in MCF7 cells when Herceptin
was added to IGFIR inhibitors (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that
there exists cross-talk between HER2 and IGFIR in both cell lines.
Effect of co-targeting on IGFIR and HER2 signal transduction. We further investigated the effect of combination treatment
on the downstream growth factor signaling pathways. In BT474
cells, maximal inhibition of ERK1/2 activity required the combination of both HER2 and IGFIR antagonists. Similar but less
striking trends were observed for drug effects on AKT activity
(Fig. 6A). In MCF7 cells, only AG1024 showed single agent partial
inhibitory effect on ERK1/2 activity; however, combining Herceptin
with either of the IGFIR inhibitors profoundly inhibited ERK1/2
activity (Fig. 6B). Although AKT was difficult to detect in this cell
line, again, the trend was for the drug combinations to have the
greatest inhibitory effect (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
We have discovered dramatic effects of adding IGFIR inhibitors
to agents that target HER2. Synergistic effects of these receptor
inhibitors affect all aspects of the transformed phenotype:
proliferation, anchorage independence, and survival. The most
remarkable results are the effects of IGFIR/HER2 targeting in the
HER2-nonoverexpressing MCF7 cells, for which Herceptin typically
produces no effect as a single agent. Herceptin was developed as an
agent that would inhibit HER2-overexpressing tumor cells without
affecting HER2-nonoverexpressing cells. Recent preliminary reports
suggest that clinical activity of Herceptin when combined with
chemotherapy may be observed in subsets of patients not
classically thought to be ‘‘HER2 positive’’ (14, 15). We believe that
our results support that HER2 has an important function in breast
cancer even when it is not overexpressed/amplified; we postulate
that in nonoverexpressing cells, loss of that function can be
compensated for by other signaling pathways. However, when such
other pathways are themselves inhibited (IGFIR in the present
case), the critical importance of HER2 becomes apparent.

Evidence of cooperation between IGFs and HER family ligands
has been well-documented (16–18). Prolonged activation of ERK2
by epidermal growth factor (EGF) seen in wild-type cells was
absent in cells from IGFIR knockout mice embryos but could be
rescued by reintroduction of the IGFIR (19); IGFIR signaling was
also required for EGF-induced 3T3 proliferation. Breast cancer cells
cultured for resistance to Iressa had elevated levels of activated
IGFIR and increased sensitivity to an IGFIR TKI (20). In one model,
the mitogenic effect of neuregulin was inhibited by an antisense
oligodeoxynucleotide to the IGFIR (21). This model also showed
IGFIR/HER2 cross-talk and physical association (22). IGFIR and
HER2 physically associated as shown by coimmunoprecipitation
and confocal microscopy. In MCF7 cells, IGFIR/HER2 association
was inducible with either neuregulin or IGF-I. A possible role for
IGFIR in Herceptin resistance has been suggested by both
preclinical (3–7) and clinical (8) studies.
Evidence suggests that the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase
(ERK1/2) pathway and PI3K/AKT pathway are the most important

www.aacrjournals.org

signal transduction outputs in the roles of both IGFIR and HER2 in
transformed cells. Our mechanistic studies suggest cross-talk
between HER2 and IGFIR at the level of receptor activities. This
may be indirect; however, in our experiments a physical association
of the two receptors in an immunoprecipitable complex was
detected. In addition, we found that co-targeting both receptors
resulted in the most efficient inhibition of ERK1/2 and AKT activity.
We postulate that this more complete inhibition of these pathways
underlies the observed synergy, although alternative mechanisms
cannot be excluded. For example, we occasionally observed no
effect of a given drug on a specific pathway, but potentiation of
inhibition of that pathway when the same ‘‘inactive’’ drug was used
in a combination. For example, in both cell lines, aIR3 had no
single agent effect on ERK1/2 activity, but the agent substantially
potentiated the ability of HER2 antagonists to inhibit ERK activity.
Such results suggest that the drug combination effects may not
always be simply due to a dose-response to blocking common
pathway(s) downstream of each receptor, but rather a more

complex phenomenon, such as an effect on receptor to receptor
cross-talk, a threshold effect, or other indirect mechanisms.
However, another recent study examined the antitumor potential
of recombinant human IGFBP-3, an IGF-I antagonistic protein
with high affinity for the IGF-I ligand (23). This study found that
IGFBP-3 displayed a synergistic interaction with Herceptin in
Herceptin-resistant breast cancer cell lines, and, such as our study,
a suggestion that the ability to effectively inhibit activity of Akt and
ERK1/2 was important mechanistically.

In summary, we have found that in HER2-overexpressing
(BT474) or nonoverexpressing (MCF7) human breast carcinoma
cells, the combination of HER2/IGFIR antagonists potentiate
growth inhibition and also induce massive apoptosis of cells
growing in monolayer. Furthermore, in both cell lines, our results
show that HER2/IGFIR co-targeting results in maximal inhibition
of ERK1/2 and AKT activity. The most striking result with
potentially wide-ranging clinical implication is the ability of
Herceptin to induce apoptosis in HER2-nonoverexpressing MCF7

cells when added to IGFIR antagonists. These compelling results
imply that wisely chosen inhibitor combinations may have
dramatic synergy, inducing cell death even when one signaling
pathway in isolation is dispensable, and therefore, such combinations are potentially applicable to a much broader range of
patients than one would predict based on receptor expression
levels or effects of individual drugs. Until recently, Herceptin had
only shown activity in patients with HER2 overexpression/
amplification. Recent preliminary results reported in abstract
form suggest that Herceptin may occasionally augment chemotherapy effect in patients having tumors without detectable HER2
overexpression or amplification. Our data provide a tantalizing
suggestion that an IGFIR/HER2 antagonist combination may be
applicable to treatment of a broad array of breast cancer patients
regardless of HER2 status. Herceptin has not shown significant
clinical activity in malignancies other than breast cancer. Of note,
in osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma cell lines, Herceptin was

Hence, lessons learned from idealized model systems such as
HER2-driven breast cancer may inform investigators as to how
such targeted drug combinations may be used in other
malignancies by potentially revealing a set of pathways crucial
to the maintenance of the malignant phenotype of solid tumors in
general.
