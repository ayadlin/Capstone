ABSTRACT
Concepts of individualized therapy in the 1970s and 1980s attempted to develop
predictive in vitro tests for individual drug responsiveness without reaching clinical
routine. Precision medicine attempts to device novel individual cancer therapy
strategies. Using bioinformatics, relevant knowledge is extracted from huge data
amounts. However, tumor heterogeneity challenges chemotherapy due to genetically
and phenotypically different cell subpopulations, which may lead to refractory
tumors. Natural products always served as vital resources for cancer therapy (e.g.,
Vinca alkaloids, camptothecin, paclitaxel, etc.) and are also sources for novel drugs.
Targeted drugs developed to specifically address tumor-related proteins represent
the basis of precision medicine. Natural products from plants represent excellent
resource for targeted therapies. Phytochemicals and herbal mixtures act multispecifically, i.e. they attack multiple targets at the same time. Network pharmacology
facilitates the identification of the complexity of pharmacogenomic networks and
new signaling networks that are distorted in tumors. In the present review, we give
a conceptual overview, how the problem of drug resistance may be approached
by integrating phytochemicals and phytotherapy into academic western medicine.
Modern technology platforms (e.g. “-omics” technologies, DNA/RNA sequencing,
and network pharmacology) can be applied for diverse treatment modalities such as
cytotoxic and targeted chemotherapy as well as phytochemicals and phytotherapy.
Thereby, these technologies represent an integrative momentum to merge the best of
two worlds: clinical oncology and traditional medicine. In conclusion, the integration
of phytochemicals and phytotherapy into cancer precision medicine represents a
valuable asset to chemically synthesized chemicals and therapeutic antibodies.

they are malignant. This approach causes only modest
tumor specificity, and non-tumorous normal proliferative
tissues are also affected. Thereby, the application of drug
doses high enough to kill all tumor cells including the
less sensitive tumor subpopulations cannot be applied
without provoking severe side effects in cancer patients.
As a consequence, sub-optimal drug doses may let

the very early days of cancer chemotherapy more than
half a century ago [1-6], and it still hampers successful
treatment of patients nowadays [7]. Many established

few inherently resistant tumor cells unaffected, which
subsequently grow out leading to the reappearance
of tumors. These refractory tumors do not respond to
cytostatic therapy anymore with fatal outcomes for
patients.
Current chemotherapy protocols are based on the
result of prospective, randomized, double-blind phase
III studies, which results in similar clinical standard
treatment guidelines. However, each tumor may behave in
a different manner and the treatment success of individual
patients still cannot be reliably predicted, although the
statistical probability of treatment response for larger
groups of patients can be estimated from the results of
clinical trials. The reason is that even tumors of the same
origin and histology may differ from patient to patient in
their biological behaviour. Even more, cells of the same
tumor may be different from each there, and there is a
substantial heterogeneity which greatly influences the
response of tumor cell subpopulations to chemotherapy.
While some subpopulations respond well to treatment,

others resist and give rise to treatment failure. The
appearance of drug resistance is a major, still unresolved
obstacle in cancer therapy even after many decades of
enormous efforts in cancer research. It has therefore been
attempted to understand the molecular mechanisms of
drug resistance and to predict a priori, whether or not an
individual tumor would respond to drug therapy and to
adapt treatment according to the individual drug sensitivity
profile of tumors [8]. Whereas sensitivity or resistance
to targeted drugs (e.g., HER2- or estrogen-receptortargeting small molecules or therapeutic antibodies) may
be straightforward, the reliable prediction of treatment
efficacy for the clinically long established cytotoxic drugs
is much more complicated, since their cellular targets
frequently less well-defined and these kinds of cytostatic
drugs reveal broader modes of action against malignant
and even normal proliferating cells.
In the present review, we give a conceptual
overview, how the problem of drug resistance may
be approached by integrating phytochemicals and

technology platforms (e.g. “-omics” technologies, DNA/
RNA sequencing, and network pharmacology) can be
applied for diverse treatment modalities such as cytotoxic
and targeted chemotherapy as well as phytochemicals
and phytotherapy (Figure 1). Thereby, these technologies

the same extent as it did for standard cancer chemotherapy
[12]. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), where
individualized therapy is one of the most prominent and
important features, the decision on the right combination
of herbs for an individual cancer patient mainly relies on
the particular TCM diagnostics rather than on predictive
in vitro tests. Therefore, these kinds of assays are not very
popular. In Western countries, predictive chemosensitivity
assays are broadly offered by commercial sources for use
in complementary and alternative medicine. Although
it can well happen that they will frequently be applied,
results are scarcely reported in the scientific literature.

PREDICTION OFDRUG SENSITIVITYAND
RESISTANCE
Diagnostic tests are desirable to predict sensitivity
of resistance of each individual tumor to drug treatment.
If a tumor is resistant, therapy may only provoke toxicity
in healthy organs without eradication the cancer itself [6].
In case a tumor is resistant to certain drugs, the treatment
regimen may be changed to other still effective drugs.
Therefore, early concepts of individualized therapy in
the 1970s and 1980s attempted to devise diagnostic in
vitro tests to predict the drug responsiveness in individual
patients [9, 10]. Although many different assays have
been developed, none of them reached the status of
routine clinical diagnostics [5, 11]. A meta-analysis of
the literature published during the past four decades
considering test results of more than 15, 000 tumor patients
unambiguously demonstrated in the majority of studies
that resistance was correctly predicted with accuracy
between 80 and 100%, while drug sensitivity could only
be predicted with an accuracy of 50-80% [10]. In the past
decades, the main attention of oncologist was focused on
the identification of sensitive drugs which would be able
to treat otherwise resistant tumors. Therefore, the high
reliability of these in vitro tests to predict resistance rather
than sensitivity was not sufficiently appreciated. This was
mainly due to the lack of alternative treatment options
in case a tumor turned out to be resistant to the available
standard drugs at that time. The physicians in the clinics
were understandably reluctant to tell a patient “Your
tumor is predicted as being resistant. Sorry, we cannot do
anything for you”. Nowadays the situation has changed
as more treatment strategies are available. If a tumor
behaves resistant to one or several cytostatic anticancer
drugs, other options may be chosen such as antibody
therapy, adoptive immunotherapy, high-dose therapy,
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, supportive gene
therapy protocols, hyperthermia, and also - as we will
see below - phytotherapy. Therefore, the high reliability
to predict resistance should be understood as a valuable
chance to plan other individualized treatment options.
Therefore, a rethinking of the “chemosensitivity” concept
has been proposed to unravel and revive the full potential
of a revival of predictive tests for personalized medicine.
The concept of predictive chemosensitivity and
-resistance testing has not been documented in the
literature for natural products and herbal remedies by far to

RELEVANCE
OF
“-OMICS”
TECHNOLOGIES FOR PRECISION
MEDICINE AND DRUG DISCOVERY
A crucial decision in individualized therapy is not
only the choice of the right drug for the right patient, but
also the right combination of drugs and the duration and
dose of treatment. Because of the complexity of tumor
genomes, this may be difficult to dissect with the classical
methodology of clinical trials. As a direct consequence of
the deciphering of the human genome at the verge from
the second to the third millennium, techniques have been
developed that allow to determine (1) genomic variations
such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [13],
copy number variations and other structural variations
associated with disease progression and drug response
(genomics), (2) epigenetic modifications such as DNAmethylation, histone acetylation or micro-RNA expression
(epigenomics), (3) transcriptome-wide mRNA expression
(transcriptomics), (4) proteome-wide protein and peptide
expression (proteomics) in cells or tissues. These methods
have frequently been termed “-omics” technologies.
In recent years, the rapid technological advancements
brought transcriptome-wide RNA-sequencing (“next
generation sequencing”) into play. The results obtained
with these sophisticated techniques are evaluated by
methods of computational biology and bioinformatics to
extract and model the relevant knowledge gained from a
vast plethora of generated data [14, 15]. The potential of
this new technological dimension of technology lies in
its translation from the laboratory to practical routine for
diagnosis and treatment and comprehensive approach to
diagnosing tumors and tumor subtypes, to predict response
to treatment and occurrence of unwanted side effects),
Individualized treatment regimens may be planned based
on a patient’s (or tumor’s) individual expression profiles
to optimize the survival prognosis of cancer patients [1618]. Several conditions determine the setup of patienttailored therapies, e.g. (1) comprising meta-analyses on
DNA sequencing results and related implications for drug
development, and (2) the availability of individual targeted
agents and biomarkers for therapy monitoring [19]. A
multi-dimensional clinical genomics study of children

and adolescent young adults with relapsed non-central
nervous system solid cancers may be taken as a clue, how
integrative genomic analyses and robust bioinformatics
may serve to generate precision therapy protocols for the
future [20].
The challenge of this new concept of precision
medicine will be to delineate individual and efficient
cancer therapy strategies, which are superior to traditional
concepts of standardized tumor treatment. Enormous
amounts of “-omics” data together with drug combination
studies and biological network data analyses are required,
since tumors consist of heterogeneous subpopulations
with distinct biological features [21, 22]. A pilot project in
this context represents the connectivity map, which aims
to establish a connection between chemicals and gene
expression profiles in different cancer cell lines for more
than 1700 compounds [23]. This project is certainly only
a starting point, but it illustrates the complex requirements
to develop individualized treatment protocols.
Advancements in molecular diagnostics is only one
side of the coin, and the development of novel drugs has
to keep pace, which may be an even more difficult task to
master. Drug development and marketing is a time- and
cost-intensive process and the number of newly approved
drugs declined for decades, mainly because of their failure
in clinical phase 2 trials, despite the fact that time and
expenditure on drug research and development (R&D)
consistently increased during recent years [24, 25]. The
hope was that the emerging high throughput technologies
might supplement “-omics” technologies and next
generation sequencing to generate novel drug candidates
for the market.
In this context, a surprising concept emerged
[26]. Existing drugs with a well-known safety and
pharmacokinetic profiles that failed against certain
diseases might serve as valuable drug candidates for other
diseases affected by the same pathway. This phenomenon
has been described as drug repositioning [27]. An
intriguing example of the potential of drug repositioning
is thalidomide, which has been banned as barbiturate for
its teratogenic effects [28]. Later on, thalidomide has
been identified as effective drug against severe erythema
nodosum leprosum [29] and multiple myeloma [30].
Another less dramatic example is retinoic acid, which
has been found to be active against acute promyelocytic
leukemia [31].

surviving tumor cells may lead to repopulation and
refractory tumors. Single-cell sequencing allows novel
insights into the diversified and complex molecular
architecture of heterogeneous tumors. The isolation and
sequencing of single tumor cells are technically very
challenging and consists of three major steps: (1) single
cell isolation (e.g. by laser-capture microdissection
or fluorescence-activated cell sorting), (2) whole
genome amplification (e.g. with the help of Phi29
DNA polymerase), and (3) transcriptome-wide next
generation sequencing technologies. The problem of
tumor heterogeneity especially applies to drug resistance.
Single cell sequencing will facilitate the detection of even
the smallest populations of drug-resistant cells. Thereby,
single-cell sequencing and may form the basis for novel
and improved treatment options to eradicate drug-resistant
tumor cells with specific genetic alterations [32].

THE CONTRIBUTION OF NATURAL
PRODUCTS
Natural products always served as vital resources for
cancer therapy. Well-known examples of the therapeutic
potential of plant-derived natural products plants are
the microtubule inhibiting Vinca alkaloids, the DNA
topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, the terpene
paclitaxel, or the podophyllotoxin-derived lignans,
etoposide and teniposide.
A survey of the National Cancer Institute showed
that 69% of anticancer drugs approved between the 1980s
and 2002 are either natural products or developed based on
knowledge gained from natural products [33]. Intriguingly,
about three-quarters of plant-derived drugs in clinical use
nowadays have their roots in traditional phytomedicines.
Although medicinal herbs belonged to the standard
repertoire to combat diseases since ages, they gradually
lost relevance with increasing successes of synthetic
pharmaceuticals in western countries during the 20th
century. Owing to the interest in bioactive natural products
as chemical lead compounds for the generation of semisynthetic derivatives with improved pharmacological
features, medicinal plants as well as other natural
resources (from marine or microbiological ecosystems)
experience a thriving revival [34-36].
Secondary metabolites are synthesized by plants
as a defense against competitors, herbivores and
pathogens and as signal compounds that attract insects
for reproduction. Repelling predators is crucial for plants
since they do not have elaborated immunological defense
mechanisms nor can they flew, because they are sessile.
Secondary metabolites maintain crucial functions for
survival and reproductive fitness of plants [37, 38]. In
addition to toxicity, secondary plant metabolites exert
pharmacological features, which make them valuable for
treatment purposes. The separation of these beneficial from
harmful effects is the goal of modern and pharmacognosy

TUMOR HETEROGENEITY
Cancers of the same histological type do not
only differ from patient to patient, but also consist of
heterogeneous subpopulations of cells within one and
the same tumor. Heterogeneity represents a considerable
challenge to cancer chemotherapy, since it aggravates
the effective eradication of all cells of genetically and
phenotypically different subpopulations. Even few

THE
CHALLENGE
PHYTOTHERAPY

POSED

The medical use of plants by traditional healers is
frequently accompanied by spiritual and magical rituals.
While these practices are doubtless of interest to cultural
anthropology, rationale phytotherapy should focus solely
on seeking scientific evidence for the pharmacological
activity of medicinal plants. On the other hand, the
demystification and “secularization” of medicinal plants
also applies to industrialized countries, where “green
medicine” is sometimes associated with esoteric elements.
If we consider phytotherapy as a regular discipline
of life science, which rules and methods should be applied
to do so? Crucial elements of quality control include [42]
- ethnobotany: documentation of traditional
knowledge;
- botanical verification of medicinal herbs (modern
taxonomy, HPLC fingerprinting, DNA sequencing);
- standardization of herbal products and mixtures;
- avoidance of contaminations and adulterations;
- elucidation of molecular and cellular modes of
action;
- placebo-controlled, double-blind and randomized
clinical trials.
To guarantee the marketing of safe and efficacious
herbal products, national and international authorities
regulate the approval of these medicines, e.g. the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and
the European Medicines Agency (EMA), both of which
enforce regulatory sets of specifications including the
quality, purity standards, dosage, production, precautions,
storage, and labeling of these medicines [43]. Monographs
provide the specifications of each plant. These monographs
are usually compiled in pharmacopoeias which are
considered as official documents specifying the quality,
purity standards, dosage, production, precautions, storage,
and labeling of medicines.
A main goal of the utilization of these diverse
genetic resources is to market herbal products (i.e.
bioprospecting). Since the use of medicinal plants is
mainly based on the traditional knowledge of indigenous
communities, commercialization of herbal products by
pharmaceutical industries should, follow fair rules of
benefit-sharing with those, where the knowledge comes
from. Biopiracy practices by multinational companies
in the past should be banned [44]. The World Health
Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) draw the
international attention on the protection of indigenous
knowledge. The Nagoya protocol contains rules how to
protect traditional medical knowledge and to compensate
indigenous people for knowledge that is already being
patented or being used in an inappropriate manner in the
past. The European Parliament accepted the protocol (EU,
No. 511/2014) on April 16th 2014. It entered into force
on October 12th 2014. Main principles are (1) informed
consent of the country of origin of the resource and (2)
mutually agreed terms between indigenous peoples and
collaborative commercial partners.

The conferment of the Nobel Award for Physiology
or Medicine 2015 was Youyou Tu and her life-time
achievements on artemisinin from the Chinese medicinal
plant, Artemisia annua L. for malaria therapy represents
and appreciation for the entire scientific community
working on phytotherapy and natural products [41].
Therefore, it did not come as a surprise that the Nobel
Award to Youyou Tu was anticipated with much
enthusiasm. Now, when the celebrations are over and the
grey everyday work reality is returning back, it is the right
time to address the question what is coming next and how
to continue from here. In other words, which sustainable
actions are needed to come to long-lasting and significant
improvements in TCM and phytotherapy in general for the
sake of patients?
Research and development on artemisinin as malaria
medication followed the rules and strategies of classical
pharmacological drug, but not those of the development of
a typical phytotherapeutic drug. The process ended with a
chemical substance rather than with a standardized herbal
product. The same applies for many other drugs which
became established parts of modern pharmacopoeias. A
majority of modern drugs, which are derived in one or
the other way from natural sources were only inspired by
nature [33], but not phytotherapies in a strict sense.
As a matter of fact, traditional medicine is being
applied million times on this globe, and therefore the
general conditions are basically different from those of
synthetic chemical drugs. This may be an advantage,
but represents a disadvantage at the same time, because
there is less burning economic pressure to fulfil the strict
regulations of the drug-approval authorities. If a herbal
preparation is not marketed as drug by a pharmaceutical
company, it can be either sold over the counter as dietary
supplement without fulfilling any quality control measures,
or it can be used as therapeutic drug for individual
compassionate uses. These practices demonstrate that
herbal medicines are popular among patients, but they
frequently do not provide sufficient evidence that they are
safe and efficient.
As popular herbal medicines are among physicians,
practitioners and patients all over Asia, as critical they
are considered among the medical community in the
West. Several reasons can be discussed to explain this
contradiction. One problem is certainly that herbal
medicine does not belong to the standard repertoire of
knowledge that is taught in our medical schools to the
students. This is a fatal situation to our point of view.
Another critical issue is, however, that the safety and
quality of herbal products has still not been proven to the
same extent, as it is routinely done for synthetic drugs.

Summing up, the future of phytotherapy lies without
doubt in the production of high-quality products, which
are able to compete with synthetic drugs regarding safety
and efficacy. Phytotherapy must not be mixed up with
quackery practices in alternative medicine. Rationale
phytotherapy should fight for its image as effective
medicine with good tolerability.

major impact on the malignancy of cancer (passenger
genes). Targeted drugs developed to specifically address
proteins encoded by driver genes represent the basis
for individualized or precision medicine. Instead of
standardized therapy regimens for all patients suffering
from the same tumor type, targeted drugs can be
individually used depending on the specific expression of
aberrant targets in each single patient. Two main categories
of targeted drugs have been developed: (1) monoclonal
antibodies that address cell-surface proteins. Examples
are cetuximab and panitumumab against the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), bevacizumab against
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and rituximab
against CD20. (2) Small chemical molecules that easily
can enter tumor cells to attack intracellular targets (e.g.
cancer-related kinases). Imatinib mesylate is a showcase
example of historical relevance for the proof-of-principle
of the entire concept of targeted therapy. This drug binds
and inhibits the oncogenic BCR/ABL fusion protein. Other
small molecules are erlotinib and gefitinib against EGFR,
vemurafenib against BRAF and bortezomib against the
proteasome.
Targeted therapy is a thriving area of cancer
research, which is rapidly developing. As more novel
targets will be identified by tumor DNA sequencing and
other techniques, as more novel drugs may be developed
to inhibit them. The scientific and economic impact of the
concept of precision medicine will revolutionize cancer
therapy in the years to come. Nevertheless, targeted drugs
also have considerable disadvantages:
(1) Tumors frequently develop resistance against
targeted drugs. Alterations in the target structure (e.g.
point mutations), single nucleotide polymorphisms, cell

TARGETING
TUMOR-RELATED
PROTEINS WITH NATURAL PRODUCTS
The problem with classical standard chemotherapy
is that drugs do not sufficiently distinguish between
normal and malignant growing cells. As long as cells are
dividing, they are attacked by the drugs. A new concept
is to seek for molecular differences between normal and
cancerous cells and specifically attack cancer-related
targets by drugs. Targeted drugs are designed to kill
cancer cells by their binding to the target. Since this target
is not present in normal cells, targeted cells are expected
not to exert side effects on normal organs. Sophisticated
techniques are used to identify targets for cancer therapy
such as “-omics” technologies, cytogenetic methods, etc.
Frequently, tumor cells bear amplified genes leading to
protein overexpression are not present in normal cells.
Also, chromosomal translocations may generate fusion
genes coding for novel fusion proteins that are not existing
in healthy cells. Some of these aberrantly expressed genes
drive the development of cancer if they contain oncogenic
sequences (driver genes). Other genetic aberrations occur
in the course of tumor progression as a consequence
of genomic instability of tumors. They do not have a

Natural products from plants and other natural
origin provide an excellent resource for targeted therapies
[45-51].
(1) The number of targets for therapeutic
intervention is still increasing and novel drugs for novel
targets need to be developed. Natural products may serve
as lead compounds that can be chemically modified to
generate derivatives with improved pharmacological
properties.
(2) Natural products that overcome drug resistance.

An example is the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype.
Drug efflux pumps of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter family confer resistance to a broad spectrum of
anticancer drugs including man targeted small molecules
[52]. The lignin sesamin inhibits the ATPase activity of
several ABC-transporters and is thus potentially more
effective in overcoming MDR than previous MDR

inhibitors that block only single efflux pumps [53].
(3) The severe side effects of classical cytotoxic
(non-targeted) as well as of targeted therapy may be
alleviated or abolished by natural products and medicinal
plants (e.g. PHY906) [54-57].
To illustrate the potential of natural products for
targeted therapy, we have chosen STAT3. An important

molecule in signal transduction processes of tumors
represents signal transducer and activator of transcription
3 (STAT3). Upon binding of specific ligands (interferons,
epidermal growth factor, interleukin-5 and -6) to their
receptors, receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAK)
are activated, which in turn activate STAT3. After
phosphorylation of STAT3 at tyrosine at position 705,
STAT3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where
it binds to the DNA (Figure 2). As transcription factor,
STAT3 induces the expression of genes involved in cell
growth, apoptosis, invasion and metastatis, angiogenesis
and other cellular processes. STAT3 activation can
also take place by mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK) and c-SRC non-receptor tyrosine kinase by
phosphorylation of the serine residue 727 of STAT3.
Constitutively
activated
STAT3
promotes
carcinogenesis and STAT3 overexpression has been
reported in many tumor types [58, 59]. Recent reports
indicate that STAT3 may also act as tumor suppressor
depending on the mutational background [60]. There are
many efforts to disrupt the STAT3 signaling route by small
molecule inhibitors [61]. Three major strategies have been
used to reach this goal:
(1) Inhibitors acting upstream of STAT3: Tyrosinekinase inhibitors of cell surface receptors (EGFR, HER2,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PDGFR, IGFR, etc.) inhibit downstream signalling
including the STAT3 pathway. The same is true for JAK
1/2, which are upstream of STAT3.
(2) STAT3 inhibitors that disrupt dimerization at the
SH2 domain. The SH2 domain of STAT3 consists of the
tyrosine-phosphorylation site at Tyr705 and two closely
neighbored binding sub-pockets. Most STAT3 inhibitors
bind to the SH2 domain [62].
(3) Inhibitors of the STAT3 DNA binding domain.
The sterical hindrance by small molecules to bind to DNA
inhibits the transcription factor activity of STAT3.
In addition to synthetic small molecules that
have been described as STAT3 inhibitors, a number of
phytochemicals from diverse medicinal plants also have
been reported to block STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation (Table I). Molecular docking analyses
demonstrate that they bind to the protein in a comparable
manner as reported for synthetic small molecules (Table
II). For comparison, the known STAT3 inhibitor BP-1102 was used as synthetic control compound. Its binding
energy was -7.46 (±0.36) kcal/ mol and the pKi value
was 3.81 (±1.94) µM (Table II). Except of four natural
products, all others revealed binding energies of lower
than -6 kcal/mol. Six phytochemicals revealed binding
energies even better than that of BP-1-102. The positions

of the amino acids, which are involved in binding of the
compounds to STAT3 indicate that they are located in the
SH2 domain of the protein (Figure 3).
Natural products and many synthetic drugs as well
are rarely mono-specific and frequently address more
than one target [63]. In addition to binding to one target
protein, downstream signaling is affected so that it can be
assumed that rather many than single proteins or genes
are involved in the modes of action of a drug. Deciphering
the full complexity of cellular mechanisms and signalling

pathways affected by a drug can be a tedious task.

neoambrosin and damsin, two cytotoxic phytochemicals
from the medicinal plant, Ambrosia maritima L. Their
cytotoxic activity towards cancer cells has been reported
[64]. In addition to targeting STAT3 (Table II, Figure 3,
[64]), microarray analyses revealed that the expression
of numerous genes was increased or decreased by these
two compounds. The assignment of these genes to their
corresponding signaling pathways unraveled many
different actions, which all may contribute to different
extent to the bioactivity of these compounds. The
network analyses in Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the complex
interaction networks of these two compounds. Microarray
analyses revealed that the mRNA expression of 606 and
473 genes was increased or decreased after treatment
of CCRF-CEM leukemia cells with neoambrosin and
damsin, respectively. Figure 4 shows each the top 10
most increased or decreased genes upon treatment of
cells with neoambrosin or damsin. STAT3 was also
among the increased genes. These genes have been
subjected to Ingenuity network analysis (Figure 5). One
of the advantages of network pharmacology is that all
possible actions can be identified in a comprising manner.
However, at the same time this bears the danger that genes
appear, which are not causatively related to the mechanism
of action of a drug. The art is to separate non-relevant
background noise from those signals that really contribute
to the modes of action by subsequent experimentation.
Genetic networks such as those shown in Figure 5 rather
represent the start than the end of processes to elucidate
the mode of action of drugs.
As a consequence of the complexity of drug actions,
another new concept is emerging called polypharmacology,
which focuses on drugs attacking multiple instead of
single targets to perturb disease-associated networks
[65, 66]. To combat complex systemic diseases such as
cancer, single target drugs have been proven to be less
effective than promiscuous compounds that influence
multiple targets and exert maximal efficacy and minimal
toxicity [67-70]. The analysis of complex signaling
network may unravel novel targets for drug development
[71, 72]. Network-based approaches are rapidly emerging
in recent years [65, 68, 73]. Polypharmacology might
also provide novel opportunities to fight drug-resistant
tumor cells [74]. Network pharmacology facilitates the
establishment of pragmatic network models and the
prediction of drug targets based on public databases. In
addition, it also helps to construct predictive ‘drug target
disease’ network models using high-throughput screening
and bioinformatics. Such approaches help to investigate
underlying mechanisms of drug actions on biological
networks by comparing the action of a drug with its target
[75].
Cancer is a complex disease arising from changes
in multiple biological networks [76], which is believed
to require complex therapeutic approaches [77]. Finding
drugs that act in multiple pathways, or to discern possible
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drug combinations represents one of the main future
challenges by understanding the signaling networks of
human cells and how they are altered in different cancers
[78].
To be highly effective, interventions within
biological networks should be multiple on the one
hand, but extremely selective on the other hand to spare
normal organs from detrimental side effects [79]. Holistic
approaches may qualify network pharmacology as suitable
tool for drug development for complex diseases such as
cancer.
There are various sophisticated signaling networks
driving tumorigenesis and tumor progression that can be
therapeutically targeted. Instead of initial time-consuming
laboratory experiments, network biology approaches for
well-known pathways with various drugs might be more
suitable for timely cancer drug discovery [80].
Network pharmacology facilitates the identification
of new signaling networks that are distorted in various
cancer types. Recently, Jaeger et al. discovered several
known but unexpected as well as unknown pathways
in triple negative breast cancer [81] and in ovarian
carcinoma [82]. Pan-cancer network analysis of mutated
networks helps to identify mutated sub-networks in cancer
and paves the way to investigate new diagnostic and
therapeutic prospects for specific cancer subtypes [83].
In the past few years, numerous novel signaling
networks have been unraveled that contribute to
carcinogenesis and tumor progression. It becomes more
and more clear that the complex nature of alterations in
cancer cells can hardly be attacked by drugs addressing
single targets or pathways. Comprising, novel therapeutic
strategies have to be devised that are able to inhibit entire
malignancy-regulating networks. It is hoped that network
pharmacology provides a platform for the development of
a novel generation of drugs fulfilling this requirement.
Network pharmacology became a powerful tool to
systematically reveal complex biological relationships. In
cancer and other diseases, network pharmacology relies on
“-omics” approaches to detect the variables at fundamental
cellular and molecular units in response to the specific
pathophysiology and/or drug treatment. The generated
dataset of variables helps to generate networks from the
genomic up to the metabolomic level to classify molecular
processes in disease conditions. The high availability of
multi-omics cancer databases opens new opportunities for
data integration that promises an in-depth understanding
of cancer and clinically and biologically meaningful tumor
stratification [84].
The “-omics” technologies allow to measure not
only well-known signaling pathways and biological
networks in its entirety, but also to detect novel pathways
and mechanisms that have not been described before
in a given experimental context. Another considerable
advantage is that cellular alterations caused by even highly
complex herbal mixtures can be measured. Frequently,

the holistic approach of herbal medicine cannot be
satisfactorily investigated by the reductionistic methods of
western science. Novel methods of network pharmacology
may offer new solutions for holistic approaches.
On the other hand, some disadvantages have to be
considered. With huge amounts of generated data, it may
be difficult to distinguish causative mechanisms from
irrelevant “background noise”. Additional verification
experiments are indispensable to substantiate the results
obtained from “-omics” technologies. In the past, time
and concentration kinetic experiments have rarely been
performed in network pharmacology, because of the
high costs. This bears the danger that optimal time points
and drug concentrations to measure a pharmacological
effect may be missed. With decreasing prices and further
technology developments, this disadvantage might be
overcome. Another general disadvantage is that expression
analyses (e.g. transcriptomics or proteomics) do not allow
to draw conclusions about the functional state of proteins
(e.g. their phosphorylation state). This emphasizes the
necessity to validate pathways identified by expression
analyses by additional experiments.
Recently, there is a shift from microarray
technologies to next generation sequencing methods
such as RNA sequencing. In contrast to microarrays, this
technology is not limited by the existing of sequencing
information of genes. Another advantage is that
background signals are much lower in RNA sequencing
compared to microarray hybridization. Furthermore,
the dynamic range for quantification of gene expression
is much better leading to high levels of reproducibility
among both technical and biological replicates.
Approaches with pleiotropic natural products
that target multiple proteins and pathways in cancerassociated networks may be promising. Traditional herbal
medicines play an important role in health maintenance
all over the world. Herbal medicines are regarded as a
valuable resource for new active compounds in drug
discovery due to their multiplicity in structure, bioactivity
and tolerability. The concept of ‘one disease - one drug
- one target’ is shifting towards ‘one disease - one drug multiple target’ [65, 85-88]. Network-based strategies will
facilitate structure-based drug design, forecast harmful
side effects of drugs, and predict the effects of drugbinding on biomolecules and signaling pathways [89].
Tumors frequently develop resistance to monospecific drugs. Mutations in the corresponding target
protein may easily lead to inefficacy of such a drug.
By contrast, drugs addressing multiple targets are not
compromised in their activity, if mutations in one of the
targets appear. Most natural products exert their bioactivity
by attacking multiple rather than single targets [63]. It can
be speculated that during evolution of life the selective
pressure favoured the emergence of multi-target specific
compounds, as they make organisms more successful and
competitive in the struggle for life.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Network pharmacology may provide unique
opportunities for systematic target identification and
possibilities to address them by multi-target specific
natural compounds [90]. Highly connected nodes in
complex protein networks are more vulnerable for
pharmacological inhibition of the entire network than other
nodes [91]. However, not all protein nodes in a network
can be inhibited by drugs. It has been estimated that only
about 15% of any protein nodes in a given network are
druggable. To generate rational phytotherapies based on
network information, several strategies can be considered:
(1) Plants or herbal mixtures can be considered,
if their bioactive chemical constituents are known. This
approach is based on their use in traditional medicines
and is largely experience-based. In a way, herbal mixtures
are comparable to multidrug combination therapy with
synthetic drugs and polypharmacology [92].
(2) Multi-target specific therapy may also be
reached with single phytochemicals with selective
polypharmacological approaches [93, 94]. The promiscuity
of many drugs to react with more than one target has been
negatively discussed in the past as off-target activities. In
the context of network pharmacology, off-target effects
may be reinterpreted as broader polypharmacology
profiles.
(3) Recent concepts in network pharmacology
emphasize the potential of synthetic lethality [95].
Proteins which a non-essential in normal cells may reach
therapeutic relevance, if connected in a cancer network
[96]. Their combined elimination or inhibition may lead to
improved or even synergistic tumor cell eradication. Many
single gene or protein knockouts exhibit no or marginal
effects on tumor growth, even if relevant cancer-related
targets are affected. In normal tissues, redundant protein
functions and compensatory signal transduction pathways
lead to robust phenotypes [97]. What makes much sense
in normal physiology of organisms, poses severe treatment
obstacles in cancer therapy. A conceptual solution to this
problem may be not to knock out single disease-causing
proteins, but to perturb entire disease-causing networks by
polypharmacology with phytochemicals or complex herbal
mixtures targeting multiple targets in cancer networks.
A network pharmacology approach for green
tea polyphenolics revealed their multiple bioactivities
towards various diseases including cancer. A total of
200 human targets were identified. This study illustrated
the mechanisms of pleiotropic activity of green tea
polyphenolics towards cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative
disease, cardiovascular disease, muscular disease, and
inflammation [98]. Recently, a novel integrated Herbal
Medicine Systems Pharmacology (HMSP) platform was
used to investigate how herbs act on the human body at the
molecular level. This platform supports drug absorption,
distribution, metabolization and excretion (ADME)
prediction, target fishing, drug target generation and data
processing for the association of herbs’ actions to diseases

and organisms [99]. Using another systems pharmacology
method, the mechanism of restoration of proper balance
and harmony inside the body, organ and energy system
has been elucidated for Qi-enriching and blood-tonifying
herbs in TCM [100].
Network pharmacology may also help to better
understand the reasons for failure of drugs in clinical
trials regarding clinical efficacy, side effects and toxicity.
The world populations are heterogeneous and genetic
polymorphisms in pharmacologically relevant genes
varying across geographical region are significant [101]. In
addition, tumors are also heterogeneous, which is defined
by presence or absence of actionable therapeutic targets
[102]. The currently available therapeutic interventions for
heterogeneous populations with heterogeneous tumors are
still very limited. Network pharmacology approaches may
overcome the pitfalls in cancer therapy and facilitate the
development of novel anticancer drugs.

cannot be overseen. They were already valuable in the era
of cytotoxic drugs. Paclitaxel, vincristine, camptothecin,
etoposide are just a few examples for established plantdrived anticancer drugs. There is a plethora of literature
demonstrating that phytochemicals are also valuable for
targeted cancer therapy.
Cancer stem-like cells are rare self-renewing
omnipotent cells, which proliferate upon appropriate
stimulation and differentiate into heterogeneous lineages
in tumors. They are frequently resistant to conventional
chemo- and radiotherapy. Interestingly, natural products
have been described to inhibit cancer stem-like cells [103107]. This is a new field of research that is worth being
investigated in more detail to understand the full range
of mechanisms, which are responsible why some natural
products are able to attack stem-like cells.
With the recent developments in bioinformatics,
network pharmacology emerges as novel concept in
therapy research. Phytotherapy with mixtures of several
herbs as well as isolated single compounds exert their
bioactivity by targeting multiple sites in diseased cells.
A challenge for research in network pharmacology will
certainly be to extract meaningful information from
thousands of data points. What is a mechanistically
relevant signal and what is background noise? Finding
the needle in the haystack will be a task for the future
and smart computer algorithms are required. Network
pharmacology has to cope with multiple dimensions
of problems. The multi-targeted nature of drug action,
resistance development, side effects on normal organs
and tissues, inter-individual biological variations, as
well as inter- and intra-tumoral differences have to be
considered. Especially the problem of tumor heterogeneity
and possibilities to tackle with genetically diverse tumor
subpopulations deserve attention from our point of view.
Heterogeneous tumor populations represent a main
reason for the development of resistant refractory tumors.
Resistance also prevents to apply doses high enough
to kill all cells, because of the severe side effects of
anticancer drugs. Therefore, novel strategies to eradicate
heterogeneous tumor subpopulations might not only fight
the development of drug resistance but also facilitate to
reduce side effects.
Integrating precision medicine into routine cancer
therapy is certainly one of the predominant tasks of the
next years to come (Figure 6). To realize this concept,
it is not only necessary to establish the scientific basis
allowing routine application in the clinic, but also to
develop and integrate economic models, which allow
the implementation of personalized medicine [108-111].
This is true independent of whether synthetic drugs or
phytotherapeutic approaches will be used. While there
is a plethora of literature on the preclinical activity of
phytochemicals and medicinal plant preparations, results
from clinical trials are still relatively rare. However,
there are well-done clinical trials that provide evidence

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
The fact that chemosensitivity testing was not
established as routine laboratory method may have
historical reasons. In times as combination therapy
protocols were established as being superior to
monotherapy, data showing that tumors can reveal
resistance towards many drugs at the same time was
compromising the utility of drug combination regimens.
On the one hand, clinical experiences showed
combination therapy protocols were able to improve
treatment results, but sustainable use of patients from
cancer is far from reality in many cases. On the other
hand, molecular mechanisms were discovered in basic
sciences that explained the appearance of broad spectrum
resistance phenomena (e.g. ABC-transporter-mediated
multidrug resistance, apoptosis resistance etc.). A rethinking may lead to a revival of predictive testing.
Rather than prediction of drug sensitivity (which is not
sufficiently reliable), drug resistance can be predicted with
high precision. With multi-modal treatment options at
hand, the knowledge about high probability that a specific
drug would fail in a specific patient is valuable, because
it allows early to switch to other more effective drugs or
therapy strategies.
The development of resistance and the severe
side effects of classical cytotoxic cancer therapy lead
to a paradigm shift from the poorly specific cytotoxic
anticancer drugs to targeted drugs, which were expected
to be more tumor-specific. Indeed, this turned out to
be a thriving concept with numerous new drugs on the
market, which of course did not replace the classical
cytotoxic drugs, but did supplement the armory to fight
cancer. Although treatment outcomes could be further
improved by targeted drugs they unfortunately also reveal
side effects and are subject to resistance development. In
this context, the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals

active in the clinical setting [111-119]. For the sake of
future patients, health care systems in industrialized and
developing countries should do any effort to improve cure
rates of tumor diseases.
