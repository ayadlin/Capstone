Abstract
+

Her-2/neu tumor cells refractory to antibody or receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitors are emerging in treated patients.
To investigate if drug resistant tumors can be controlled by
active vaccination, gefitinib and antibody sensitivity of four
neu+ BALB/c mouse mammary tumor lines were compared.
Significant differences in cell proliferation and Akt phosphorylation were observed. Treatment-induced drug resistance was associated with increased chromosomal
aberrations as shown by spectral karyotyping analysis,
suggesting changes beyond neu signaling pathways. When
mice were immunized with pneuTM encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of neu, antibody and
T-cell responses were induced, and both drug-sensitive and
drug-resistant tumor cells were rejected. In T-cell–depleted
mice, drug-sensitive tumors were still rejected by vaccination, but drug-refractory tumors survived in some mice,
indicating their resistance to anti-neu antibodies. To further
test if T cells alone can mediate tumor rejection, mice were
immunized with pcytneu encoding full-length cytoplasmic
neu that is rapidly degraded by the proteasome to activate
CD8 T cells without inducing antibody response. All test
tumors were rejected in pcytneu-immunized mice, regardless
of their sensitivity to gefitinib or antibody. Therefore,
cytotoxic T lymphocytes activated by the complete repertoire
of neu epitopes were effective against all test tumors. These
results warrant Her-2 vaccination whether tumor cells are
sensitive or resistant to Her-2–targeted drugs or antibody
therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7502–11]

Introduction
ErbB-2/Her-2/neu, a member of the ErbB receptor tyrosine
kinase family, is weakly to moderately expressed in normal adult
tissues. Dysregulated signal transduction from overexpressed or
mutated Her-2 leads to cellular immortalization, neoplastic transformation, and tumor progression (1). Overexpression of Her-2/
neu in 20% to 30% of human breast cancers is correlated with
more aggressive disease and reduced survival (2–5). Upon dimer
formation with other ErbB family members, transphosphorylation
of tyrosine residues in the COOH terminus provides docking sites
for signal transduction and adaptor molecules, leading to cell

proliferation, migration, adhesion, and transformation (6–9). The
activated signaling involves phospholipase C, mitogen-activated
protein kinase, c-src, and the phosphatidylionsitol-3 kinase-Akt
pathways.
Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized murine monoclonal
antibody (mAb; 4D5), which binds to Her-2 at the juxtamembrane region of domain IV, is used to treat metastatic Her-2+
breast cancer or in adjuvant settings for patients with less
advanced disease (10). When tested as a monotherapy, trastuzumab showed 15% response rate with 9.1 months median duration
(11). The efficacy of trastuzumab can be increased by combining
with paclitaxel with 59% response rate and 10.5 months duration
(12). Several mechanisms may account for trastuzumab activity,
such as down-modulation of Her-2, disruption of downstream
signaling (13, 14), or induction of antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Cardiac dysfunction is the most
significant toxicity, particularly when combined with selected
chemotherapy. A common failure site in patients treated with
trastuzumab is the brain. In a retrospective review, 25% of
metastatic breast cancer patients with prolonged survival from
trastuzumab treatment developed brain metastases (15, 16).
Taken together, these results indicate the need for intervention
before the stage of metastatic disease using multiple treatment
modalities.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors lapatinib and gefitinib are candidate
therapeutics for Her-2+ breast cancer. Lapatinib is a dual receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) with selective inhibitory activity
for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Her-2 (17–19).
Another RTKI, gefitinib, selective for EGFR, exerts inhibitory
activity on Her-2 signaling at higher concentrations (20, 21). In
treating Her-2+ tumors, mAb, RTKI, and Her-2 vaccine may have
overlapping or complementary activities.
Because Her-2/neu+ tumor cells refractory to antibody or RTKI
are emerging in treated patients, we tested whether Her-2 DNA
vaccination would be effective against drug-sensitive versus drugresistant tumors. We assembled a panel of rat neu–expressing
tumors that are differentially sensitive to anti-neu mAb and RTKI.
The neu oncogene, identified in ethylnitrosourea-induced rat
neuroglioblastomas, is a homologue of human ErbB-2 (22). Expression of constitutively activated neu in transgenic mice was associated with spontaneous tumorigenesis (23). Neu+ tumor cell lines
with varying levels of drug sensitivity were established from NeuT
spontaneous tumors or by transfection of hormone-induced
tumors to mimic breast cancer cells with varying levels of
responsiveness to Her-2–targeted therapies.

Vaccination Controls Drug-Resistant Her-2 Tumors

Materials and Methods
Mice. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with
accredited institution guidelines and the US Public Health Service Policy
on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.3 BALB/c (ages 6–8 wk)
female mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratory. BALB NeuT
(NeuT) mice expressing a transforming neu under the control of mouse
mammary tumor virus promoter were provided by Dr. Guido Forni
(University of Torino; ref. 24). Female NeuT mice developed spontaneous
mammary tumors around ages 17 wk. Male NeuT mice developed salivary
gland tumors when they were f7 mo old. Heterozygous NeuT mice were
maintained by mating with BALB/c mice and transgene-positive mice were
identified by PCR.
Cell lines and reagents. All tissue culture reagents were purchased from
Invitrogen unless otherwise specified. Cell lines were cultured in 5% CO2,
and maintained in vitro in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 10% NCTC 109 medium, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
0.1 mmol/L MEM nonessential amino acids, 100 units/mL penicillin, and
100 Ag/mL streptomycin.
TUBO (24) was cloned from a spontaneous mammary tumor in a BALB
NeuT (NeuT; ref. 25) mouse. TUBO grew progressively in wild-type BALB/c
mice and gave rise to tumors that were histologically similar to autochthonous tumors in BALB NeuT females. Bam1a cell was established
in soft agar from another BALB NeuT spontaneous mammary tumor,
then maintained as a cell line in monolayer culture. Bam IR-5 variant was
derived from Bam1a by culturing in increasing concentrations of gefitinib
until stable growth was achieved in the presence of 5 Amol/L gefitinib
(26). Gefitinib [Iressa; ZD1839; 4-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino)-7-methoxy-6(3-morpholinopropoxy) quinazoline; Zeneca Pharmaceuticals] is a RTKI.
Antigen-presenting cells (APC) 3T3/KB and 3T3/NKB were generated
as previously described (27). Briefly, BALB/c NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were
transfected with Kd and B7.1 (KB), or with Kd, B7.1, and neu (NKB). Stable
clones were selected and maintained in medium supplemented with
0.8 mg/mL G418 and 7.5 Ag/mL of puromycin (3T3/KB) or 0.8 mg/mL G418
and 0.8 mg/mL of zeocin (3T3/NKB).
D2F2 was derived from a mouse mammary tumor that arose in a BALB/c
hyperplastic alveolar nodule line, D2 (28). D2F2 cells were cotransfected
with pRSV/neo and pCMV/neu, which encodes wild-type rat neu to
establish D2F2/neu (29). Transfected cells were maintained in medium
supplemented with 0.8 mg/mL of G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen).
DNA immunization. pcDNA/neuTM encoding the extracellular and
transmembrane domains of rat neu was previously described (24).
pCMV/cytneu (pcytneu) was constructed by deleting the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) signal sequence from pCMV/neu with a PCR strategy (30).
The first 684 bp of the protein-coding region excluding the ER signal
sequence was amplified using the high-fidelity DNA polymerase Pfu
(Stratagene). The upper primer a, 5¶-GCGGGGGAGCTCCGCCACCATGGGCACCCCAAGTGTGTAC-3¶, is homologous to the Kozak consensus ribosome-binding site (Kozak, 1986), the initiation codon ATG and 15 bp
immediately downstream from the ER signal sequence but excludes the
72-bp signal sequence itself. The lower primer h, 5¶-GTGGAGGCAGGCCAGGCAGTCAGAATGC-3¶, contains a naturally occurring BsmI site. This
PCR product was digested with SacI and BsmI and used to replace the
corresponding region in pCMV/neu to generate the plasmid pCMV/cytneu
(pcytneu). The recombinant cytneu is designed to direct the synthesis of a
cytoplasmic protein.
pEFBos/granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (pGM-CSF)
encoding murine GM-CSF was provided by Dr. N. Nishisaka at Osaka
University, Osaka, Japan. pCMV is the control empty vector. Mice were
injected in the quadriceps muscle with plasmid DNA as previously
described (30). I.m. DNA injection was followed immediately by square
wave electroporation over the injection site using a BTX830 (BTX Harvard
Apparatus) as we previously described (29). A tweezer electrode was used to
deliver 8 pulses at 100 V for 25 ms per pulse.
T-cell depletion. To deplete CD4 or CD8 T cells, mice received i.p. GK1.5
or 2.43 mAb (American Type Culture Collection), respectively, in the form of
ascites fluid. Mice were treated once or twice before tumor challenge and

www.aacrjournals.org

then once to twice per week until completion of the experiment. T-cell
depletion was verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using
peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL).
Tumor challenge. Mice were challenged s.c. with 2.5  105 (TUBO or
D2F2/neu) or 5.0  105 (Bam1a or Bam IR-5) cells in the flank. Tumor
growth was monitored by weekly palpation, and mice were sacrificed when
any one dimension of the tumor reached 20 mm. Differences in tumor
incidence were analyzed by the Log-rank test.
Measurement of anti-neu antibody by flow cytometry. To measure
anti-neu antibody, 3T3/NKB cells were incubated with serially diluted
immune mouse sera. Briefly, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat-antimouse antibody directed to the g-chain of mouse IgG ( Jackson
ImmunoResearch) was used to detect bound antibody by flow cytometry.
Normal mouse serum or isotype-matched mAb was the negative control.
A standard curve for neu binding was generated using c-erbB2/c-neu mAb
(Ab4, clone 7.16.4; Calbiochem). Antibody concentrations in the test sera
were calculated by linear regression analysis based on the standard curve as
we previously reported (31). Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a
FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Differences in antibody concentration
were analyzed by the Student’s t test.
Measurement of IFN-;–secreting T cells by ELISPOT assay. Neu
reactive T cells were measured by ELISPOT assay (29). PBL or spleen cells
were suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. A total
of 4  105 spleen cells were added to each well of a 96-well HTS IP plate
(Millipore), which was precoated with 2.5 Ag/mL rat anti-mouse IFN-g
(clone R4-6A2; BD PharMingen). 3T3/NKB cells were added as APC over the
spleen cells. 3T3/KB cells were used as control. The ratio of spleen cells to
APC was 10:1. After 48 h of incubation, cells were removed and 2 Ag/mL
biotinylated rat anti-mouse-IFN-g (clone XMG 1.2; PharMingen) was added.
Plates were incubated for another 12 h at 4jC, then washed to remove
unbound antibody. Bound antibody was detected by incubating the plates
with 0.9 Ag/mL avidin-horseradish peroxidase (PharMingen) for 2 h at room
temperature. The substrate 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC; PharMingen) in
0.1 mol/L acetic acid and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide was added, and the
plate was incubated for 3 to 5 min. AEC solution was discarded, and the
plates were washed six times with water. The visualized cytokine spots were
enumerated with the ImmunoSpot analyzer (CTL), and the results were
expressed as the number of cytokine producing cells per 106 cells. Data were
analyzed using the Student’s t test.
Proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was measured indirectly by
mitochondria metabolic activity using a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide (MTT) assay (32). Briefly, quadruplicate wells of cells were plated in flat-bottomed 96-well plates at 10,000 cells
per well. Approximately 16 h after plating, when cells reached 40% to 50%
of confluence, dilutions of anti-neu mAb 7.16.4 or gefitinib were added.
Replicate plates were terminated at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h posttreatment.
At each time point, 10 to 20 AL of 5 mg/mL MTT in PBS were added and
incubated for 4 h at 37jC before the stop reagent (Isopropanol with 0.04N
HCl) was added and the absorbance measured at 600 to 650 nm. Differences
between treatments were analyzed by Student’s t test.
Measurement of cell surface neu and MHC class 1 Kd expression by
flow cytometry. Cells were stained with anti-neu mAb 7.16.4 or anti-Kd
mAb SF1.1, followed by PE-conjugated affinity pure F(ab’)2 fragment goat
anti-mouse IgG Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:200 on ice for 25 min.
After staining, samples were washed twice and analyzed by flow cytometry
using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer. Between 10,000
and 20,000 events were collected for each sample, and the data were
analyzed using flowjo software package.
Western blot analysis. Whole cell lysates were prepared as previously
described after cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of
gefitinib or anti-neu mAb or immune sera (26). Equal amounts of protein
were loaded onto a 10% SDS gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. After blocking, primary antibodies to phospho-Akt (Cell Signaling)
were added to detect the target proteins. The membrane was washed and
labeled for 90 min at room temperature with Peroxidase-conjugated
AffiniPure Goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary Abs (Jackson

ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The membranes were developed with
enhanced SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce
Biotechnology, Inc.) and imaged with Kodak-MR film. For normalization,
blots were stripped and reprobed for h-actin.
Spectral karyotyping analysis. Cells were treated with colcemid for 2 h,
and chromosomal slides were prepared using the standard protocols
including hypotonic treatment, fixation, and air drying as we described (33).
After pepsin treatment and fixation with formaldehyde followed by
dehydration, the chromosomal slides were denatured and hybridized with
denatured painting probes (SkyPaint) for 48 h at 37jC. After slide washing,
the chromosomes were counter stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) and mounted with antifade (34). Thirty to 50 mitotic figures from
each cell line were randomly selected for spectral karyotyping (SKY) images.
The selection criterion were high-quality hybridization signals and minimal
chromosomal overlapping. The presence of chromosomal abnormalities
was not a selection criterion. This procedure was used for both the spectral
and DAPI images.
Chromosomes were karyotyped by the color and the size of each
chromosome using software developed by Applied Spectral Imaging, Inc.
A unique single color was assigned to individual chromosomes. The presence of mixed colors along a chromosomal arm indicated a translocation
(indicated by arrows). Clonal chromosomal aberrations (CCA) referred to

identical or closely related chromosomal aberrations occurring at least
twice in 20 to 50 mitotic figures (35). When CCAs dominated a cell
population, the tumor was considered more stable and homogenous. The
levels of non-CCAs (NCCA) were defined by occurrence at a frequency of
<4% among 50 to 100 mitotic figures and correlated with overall genetic
instability, indicating a nonlinear pattern of cancer initiation and
progression (35).

Results
Characterization of neu+ tumor cell lines. The efficacy of neu
targeted therapy was tested with neu-expressing BALB/c mammary
tumor lines TUBO, Bam1a, Bam IR-5, and D2F2/neu. TUBO (24)
was established from a NeuT spontaneous mammary tumor (25).
Bam1a was derived independently from another NeuT spontaneous
mammary tumor by soft agar culture (26). Bam IR-5 was derived
from Bam1a by continuous culture in increasing concentrations of
gefitinib to become resistant to 5 Amol/L of gefitinib. D2F2/neu
was generated by cotransfecting BALB/c mammary tumor cell
D2F2 (28) with pCMV/neu and pRSV/neo (29). All test cells, except
D2F2, expressed neu as measured by flow cytometry using anti-neu

Vaccination Controls Drug-Resistant Her-2 Tumors

Figure 2. Effect of RTKI or anti-neu mAb on neu+ tumor cell lines. A, effect of gefitinib or anti-neu mAb on neu expression. TUBO, Bam1a, Bam IR-5, and D2F2/neu
cells in monolayer culture were incubated with 2.5 Ag/mL of mAb 7.16.4 or 4 Amol/L of gefitinib for 8 h (open histogram, gray outline ). Control groups were
treated with DMSO or normal mouse serum (open histogram, black outline ). After the incubation, cells were stained with Ab4 and PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG Fc. Shaded histogram, isotype control. B, effect of gefitinib or anti-neu mAb on Akt phosphorylation. Cells were incubated for 2 h in the presence of gefitinib (Amol/L)
or anti-neu mAb 7.16.4 (Ag/mL). Whole cell lysates were resolved in SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with phospho-Akt or control h-actin antibodies. The
concentrations of gefitinib from lanes 1 to 4 were 0, 0.25, 1, and 4 Amol/L, respectively. The concentrations of mAb 7.16.4 from lanes 2 to 4 were 0.025, 0.25, and
2.5 Ag/mL, respectively. Lane 1 was IgG2a isotype control at 2.5 Ag/mL.

mAb 7.16.4 (Fig. 1A, top row, open histogram). In addition, all test
cells expressed MHC class I, Kd, (Fig. 1A, bottom row, open
histogram). These cells may represent Her-2/neu–positive breast
cancer cells eligible for Her-2/neu–targeted therapy.
Inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by RTKI and anti-neu
mAb. The effect of RTKI and anti-neu mAb on cell proliferation
was measured by MTT assay after 24 to 120 hours of incubation
with the test agent (Fig. 1B). Reduction of TUBO cell proliferation
was observed at 1 Amol/L or higher concentrations of gefitinib.
Reduction in Bam1a cell proliferation was observed at 0.25 Amol/L
gefitinib (Fig. 1B). Although both cell lines were derived from
spontaneous NeuT mammary tumors, Bam1a cells were more
sensitive to RTKI. Bam IR-5 and D2F2/neu cells continued to
proliferate even in the presence of 4 Amol/L gefitinib, showing their
resistance to RTKI, whether acquired or intrinsic.
To test the direct effect of anti-neu mAb, tumor cells were
incubated with 0.025 to 2.5 Ag/mL of anti-neu mAb. TUBO and
Bam1a cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by 0.25 Ag/mL
or higher concentrations of mAb (P < 0.05) with greater inhibition
observed in Bam1a cells. Inhibitory activity was substantially
reduced in Bam IR-5 because 2.5 Ag/mL mAb was required to
induce growth inhibition. D2F2/neu cells were not affected, even at
2.5 Ag/mL. Therefore, cells that are resistant to RTKI are resistant
or less sensitive to anti-neu mAb.
Effect of targeted therapy on neu expression and neumediated signaling. Inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by
RTKI or anti-neu Ab may be mediated via a common or different
pathway and may indicate how tumor cells would respond to
Her-2/neu vaccination. The effects on neu expression and Akt
phosphorylation were analyzed. Cells were incubated with
4 Amol/L of gefitinib for 2 to 24 hours before expression of

www.aacrjournals.org

neu on the cell surface was measured by flow cytometry.
Figure 2A shows representative results from 8 hours of culture.
Treatment with gefitinib increased neu expression on TUBO and
Bam1a cells, with a very modest effect on Bam IR-5 and no effect
on D2F2/neu cells. This was consistent with our earlier
observation by Western blotting showing sustained total Her-2/
neu level in gefitinib-treated Bam1a cells despite a marked
reduction in phosphorylated Her-2/neu (26). Therefore, inhibition
of TUBO and Bam1a cell proliferation by RTKI was not due to
loss of neu expression.
Incubation with 2.5 Ag/mL anti-neu mAb, on the other hand,
down-modulated neu expression on TUBO, Bam1a, and Bam
IR-5 cells, and this may contribute, in part, to reduced tumor
growth (Fig. 1B). Consistent with this finding is our observation by
Western blot analysis that antibody binding induces degradation
of activated Her-2/neu in Bam1a and BamIR-5 cells (data not
shown).
Because Akt phosphorylation was critical in neu-mediated
signaling, it was measured by Western blotting. Figure 2B shows
representative results from 2-hour incubation with gefitinib or
anti-neu mAb. In TUBO and Bam1a cells, Akt phosphorylation
was reduced by gefitinib treatment, with modest effect on Bam
IR-5 and no effect on D2F2/neu cells (26). Therefore, gefitinib
dampened neu-mediated signaling in TUBO and Bam1a cells,
correlating with the growth inhibitory effect of the drug. Reduction of phospho-Akt was also induced by anti-neu mAb in TUBO
and Bam1a cells, consistent with the growth inhibitory activity
(Fig. 1B). A modest effect was induced in Bam IR-5, consistent
with the modest growth inhibition by mAb (Fig. 1B). D2F2/neu
cells that were resistant to RTKI and mAb showed little change in
Akt phosphorylation after treatment by either agent, indicating

the use of independent signaling pathways for their growth and
survival.
SKY analysis of neu-expressing cell lines. The differential
sensitivity of TUBO, Bam1a, Bam IR5, and D2F2/neu cells to
gefitinib and antibody may represent intrinsic or induced changes
of Her-2/neu+ tumor cells during therapy. Changes beyond neumediated signaling may render the tumors refractory to other
therapies. Because genomic instability has been correlated with
tumor progression and disposition to drug resistance, neu-

analysis was performed on metaphase preparations of each cell line. Full
karyotypes of each tumor cell line were shown. Arrows, translocations
summarized in Table 1.

expressing tumor cells were subjected to SKY analysis (Fig. 3). As
chromosomal instability escalates, the cell population forms
various combinations of NCCAs/CCAs (36). Table 1 shows
chromosomal aberrations in neu-expressing tumor lines, including
CCAs, NCCAs, and chromosome fragments.
Although both TUBO and Bam1a were derived from NeuT
spontaneous mammary tumors, significant disparities exist in their
karyotypes. CCAs with chromosomal translocations t(15;17),
t(4;10), and t(4;13) were found only in TUBO cells. Similarly,
NCCAs and chromosome fragments were found in TUBO, not
Bam1a cells, showing more severe chromosomal aberrations
in TUBO cells, correlating with their reduced drug sensitivity
(Fig. 1).
Bam IR-5 cells, which are resistant to gefitinib and anti-neu
mAb showed one CCA, 15% NCCAs, and many abnormal centromeres (data not shown). Bam IR-5 cells also exhibited more
trisomies of chromosome 6, 13, and 16 and monosomies of chromosome 18 and 19 relative to the parental Bam1a (Fig. 3). It is not
clear if these aberrations occurred after gefitinib treatment or if
cells with pre-existing aberrations survived the drug selection.
Regardless, continuous treatment with RTKI resulted in a cell
population with drug resistance and more profound chromosomal
aberrations.
When comparing D2F2/neu with D2F2 cells, they shared one
CCA at t(11;16) and chromosome fragments X, 13, 3, and 1
(Table 1), verifying the common origin of these cells. But the
transfected D2F2/neu cells exhibited a more stable karyotype.
Therefore, the process of generating the transfected cell line
selected for a less aberrant clone, which expressed neu at a high
level. Despite a more stable karyotype, D2F2/neu remained
refractory to Her-2–targeted drugs and mAb.
These four cell lines, all expressing neu, showed divergent
sensitivity to RTKI and anti-neu antibody as a result of genetic
aberrations and different usage of signaling pathways. In human
cancers, Her-2–positive cells with heterogeneous karyotypes may
coexist. Upon treatment with Her-2/neu–targeting agents, the
selection pressure would eliminate sensitive cells, whereas those
with greater chromosomal aberrations and drug resistance may
expand.
Inhibition of tumor growth by neu DNA vaccination. To test
if Her-2/neu vaccination can inhibit tumor growth regardless of
their chromosomal aberrations and resistance to neu-targeted
therapy, BALB/c mice were electrovaccinated twice with pGM-CSF
and pneuTM encoding the extracellular and transmembrane
domains of neu (Fig. 4). At 2 weeks after the second immunization,
an average of 19.2 F 9.5 Ag/mL anti-neu antibody was induced
(Fig. 4A). T-cell response was measured by IFN-g ELISPOT assay
using PBL. After incubation with 3T3/NKB cells that were
engineered to express neu, Kd, and B7.1 (CD80), 150 F 50/106
PBL IFN-g–secreting cells were detected in immunized mice,
significantly higher than that in control mice receiving pCMV
vector (Fig. 4B).
To determine if anti-neu immunity from DNA vaccination
protected mice from tumor growth, immunized mice were
inoculated s.c. with TUBO, Bam1a, Bam IR-5, or D2F2/neu. In
mice that received control vectors, 100% of the inoculated mice
developed progressively growing tumors, and mice were sacrificed
when tumors reached 20  20 mm (Fig. 4C). In pneuTM-vaccinated
mice, complete protection was achieved against every challenging
tumor: TUBO, Bam1a, Bam IR-5, or D2F2/neu. Therefore, neu DNA
vaccination protected mice from neu-expressing tumors, regardless

of their chromosomal aberration or resistance to neu-targeted
therapy.
To distinguish the effect of anti-neu Ab on different tumor
cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in some immunized mice were
depleted with specific mAb before tumor cell inoculation and
then at weekly intervals throughout the experiment. Complete
protection against TUBO and Bam1a tumors was achieved even
after T-cell depletion, showing the activity of vaccine-induced
anti-neu antibody against TUBO and Bam1a cells. Protection
against Bam IR5 and D2F2/neu, however, was compromised
when T cells were depleted. In 3/7 Bam IR-5 and 4/6 D2F2/neuinoculated mice, tumors grew progressively. Therefore, T-cell
immunity may not be required in controlling drug-sensitive
tumors but are indispensible for controlling drug-resistant
tumors, although anti-neu Ab may contribute to tumor rejection
also by direct suppression of Her-2 signaling or facilitation of
ADCC.
Bam IR-5 and D2F2/neu tumors that grew in vaccinated,
T-cell–depleted mice were excised (Fig. 4D), plated in monolayer
culture, and their expression of neu was measured. Bam IR-5
tumor outgrowth expressed comparable levels of neu as cells
maintained in culture. But D2F2/neu cells completely lost neu
expression after growing in mice. These results indicate that neumediated signaling is still critical to the survival of Bam IR-5 cells,
thus the sustained expression, yet dispensible in D2F2/neu cells,
which may use alternate signaling pathways for survival.
Effect of pcytneu DNA vaccine on tumor growth. To test if
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) alone could control neu+ tumors,
pcytneu vaccine was generated to encode cytoplasmic neu with a
truncated ER signal peptide. Similar to pcytE2 that we previously
reported (37), pcytneu was released into the cytoplasm upon
synthesis and rapidly degraded by the proteasome (data not
shown). Processing of proteins through this pathway would result
in the complete repertoire of neu peptides for MHC class I
presentation, but mature protein was not expressed on the cell
surface for antibody recognition.
BALB/c mice were vaccinated twice with pcytneu and pGM-CSF
(Fig. 5). Neu Abs were not detected in any of the mice as expected

(data not shown). Neu-reactive T cells from 6 immunized mice
were measured individually, and an average of 154 F 60/106
splenocytes of IFN-g–producing cells were detected (Fig. 5A).
Therefore, vaccination with pcytneu activated T cells without
inducing an antibody response. To test if T cells alone can protect
mice from neu+ tumor, immunized mice were challenged s.c. with
TUBO, Bam1a, Bam IR5, or D2F2/neu cells, and tumor growth was
measured weekly (Fig. 5B). All four tumors were rejected by
pcytneu-vaccinated mice, showing control of neu-expressing
tumors by CTL, regardless of their drug sensitivity, and that
vaccine-induced anti-neu antibody was not required for complete
tumor rejection.

Discussion
A panel of neu-expressing BALB/c mammary tumor cell lines,
TUBO, Bam1a, Bam IR-5, and D2F2/neu have been established to
represent three types of Her-2+ human breast cancers. In a portion
of Her-2+ breast cancers, Trastuzumab monotherapy inhibits
tumor growth (11). TUBO and Bam1a cells, which are highly
sensitive to anti-neu antibody and RTKI, would represent these
responsive cancer cells. In Bam IR-5 cells, neu L726I mutation
induced by gefitinib corresponds to Her-2 L726F mutation in
human breast cancer cells that are resistant to another RTKI,
lapatinib (38). Therefore, Bam IR-5 represents treatment-induced
drug-resistant tumor cells. The majority of Her-2–expressing
human tumors have intrinsic resistance to Trastuzumab because
only 11% to 23% of metastatic breast cancer patients respond to
antibody monotherapy (11, 39). D2F2/neu, which are refractory
to Her-2–targeted therapeutics without prior selection, is a
representative of these resistant cells. When developing Her-2–
based immunotherapy or vaccines, all three types of Her-2/neu+
tumors should be tested to fully assess treatment efficacy. The
propensity to develop cerebral metastases after Trastuzumab
treatment suggests therapy-induced genetic alterations or the
selection of aggressive tumor cells (15, 16), warranting vaccines
that can initiate or amplify Her-2 immunity to control drugresistant tumor cells.

Cancer Research

Although TUBO and Bam1a are both derived from spontaneous NeuT mammary tumors and they express comparable
levels of neu, more chromosomal aberrations are found in TUBO
cells, including the translocation of chromosome 4, which has
been reported in other neu-induced tumors (40). It is not clear
whether the disparities between TUBO and Bam1a cells indicate
heterogeneity of neu-induced tumors or changes induced during
tissue culture selection. However, increased chromosomal aberrations in TUBO cells correlate with their reduced sensitivity to
gefitinib when compared with Bam1a cells, suggesting the use
of alternative survival and growth signaling pathways in
TUBO cells.

Bam IR-5 cells established by prolonged culture in gefitinib have
developed CCAs, NCCAs, trisomies, and monosomies, which were
not detected in the parent Bam1a cells. The point mutation of
leucine 726 to isoleucine 726 in the ATP binding pocket of the neu
tyrosine kinase domain may change the binding of gefitinib to
Her-2 and mediate their resistance to drug and antibody treatment,
although other genetic changes such as those revealed by SKY
analysis may also contribute to the resistance.
Neu-transfected D2F2/neu cells are resistant to drug and
antibody treatment both in vitro and in vivo, showing their
independence of neu in survival and proliferation. The common
origin of D2F2 and D2F2/neu cells is evidenced by the shared

Vaccination Controls Drug-Resistant Her-2 Tumors

Figure 5. Effect of pcytneu DNA vaccination on neu
tumor growth. BALB/c mice were electrovaccinated twice,
i.m., 2 wk apart with pcytneu and pGM-CSF or control
vector and pGM-CSF. A, IFN-g–secreting T-cell
response in immunized mice was measured by ELISPOT
assay. Splenocytes were collected 2 wk after last
vaccination. Splenocytes from individual mice were
incubated with 3T3/KB or 3T3/NKB cells. Each symbol
represents the mean F SD for individual mouse in four
replicate wells. Results were expressed as number
of spots per 106 splenocytes and analyzed by Student’s
t test. B, at 3 wk after final immunization, the
remaining mice were inoculated with TUBO, Bam1a, Bam
IR-5, or D2F2/neu cells. Tumor growth was measured
weekly by palpation, and the results were expressed as %
tumor-free mice. There were six to seven mice in each
group. Results were analyzed by Log-rank test. *, P < 0.05

chromosome 11 and 16 translocations, which occur in some
hormone-induced tumors (41). It is of interest that expression of
neu resulted in a less aberrant SKY profile, suggesting the
transfection and expansion of a cell with less aberration.
Whether gefitinib resistance is a result of drug selection as
in Bam IR-5 or intrinsic resistance as in D2F2/neu, these cells are
also resistant to antibody treatment, indicating shared escape
mechanisms. But, all test cells are rejected by pcytneu vaccination, which induces CTL without antibody response. We
reported previously using pcytE2-vaccinated mice that depletion
of CD8, but not CD4 T cells, significantly reduced antitumor
immunity, showing the induction of CTL, which mediated tumor
rejection (37). Therefore, a strong CTL response to the complete
repertoire of neu peptides abolishes tumor growth regardless
of their sensitivity to neu-targeted therapy. When a strong
humoral response is induced without effector T cells, as in
T-cell–depleted, pneuTM-immunized mice, only drug-sensitive
cells were completely rejected, with partial protection against

drug-resistant cells. In patients whose tumors are refractory to
drug and antibody therapy, induction of comprehensive immunity
by active vaccination will be critical to their long term protection.
Treatment with gefitnib increased neu expression. Because neu
activation is required to induce receptor endocytosis and
degradation, inactivation of the kinase domain by gefitinib binding
may trigger a compensatory increase in Her-2/neu surface
expression. Binding of Her-2+ breast cancer cells with Trastuzumab
has been associated with decreased Her-2 surface expression (42)
with increased internalization and degradation of Her-2 (43).
Priming of endogenous Her-2 immunity and increased tumor cell
lysis by CTL has also been associated with Trastuzumab treatment
of breast cancer (44, 45). In Bam1a and TUBO cells, treatment with
anti-neu mAb reduced neu expression, Akt phosphorylation, and
cell proliferation. Anti-neu immunity may also be enhanced by
anti-neu antibody binding to tumor cells.
It is of note that even D2F2/neu cells that are resistant to
antibody in vitro are partially inhibited by vaccine-induced

antibodies in vivo, suggesting effector mechanisms such as ADCC in
tumor growth control. D2F2/neu cells that survived immune attack
in vivo completely lost neu expression, indicating the selection of
anitgen-negative tumor cells in vaccinated hosts, whereas Bam IR-5
cells maintained neu expression in immunized hosts, showing their
continued dependence on neu for tumor outgrowth.
Regarding the specificity and safety of Her-2/neu vaccination,
mice immunized with Her-2/neu DNA could not reject D2F2 cells,
which did not express Her-2/neu (data not shown), showing
specific recognition of Her-2/neu by DNA vaccination (Fig. 4).
Little to no binding of human EGFR (Her-1) transiently expressed
on 3T3 cells was detected with Her-2–immune sera (data not
shown). Immunized mice do not show any apparent abnormality
for at least 1 year except for their anti–Her-2/neu immunity (data
not shown), further showing the specificity of Her-2/neu DNA
vaccination. The complete blood count of untreated and DNAvaccinated Her-2 Tg mice did not show obvious differences (data
not shown). Therefore, the induction of Her-2/neu specific
immunity without noticeable toxicity supports the efficacy of
Her-2/neu DNA vaccines.

Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of trastuzumab

Taken together, we have shown the benefit of DNA vaccination
in the management of diverse tumors that exhibit differential
sensitivity or resistance to Her-2–targeted therapies. Anti-neu
antibody can suppress tumor growth either directly or through
mechanisms such as ADCC and may amplify T-cell immunity. A
strong Her-2/neu–specific T-cell response continues to be the goal
of Her-2 vaccination as drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumors
are both controlled by T cells.
