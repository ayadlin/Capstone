ABSTRACT
Angiogenesis and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition has been
shown to have anti-tumour efficacy, and enhance the therapeutic effects of cytotoxic
chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. The interplay of signalling alterations
and changes in metabolism and hypoxia in tumours following anti-VEGF and antiEGFR treatment is not well understood. We aimed to explore the pharmacodynamics
of cetuximab and bevacizumab treatment in human colon carcinoma tumour cells
in vitro and xenograft models through proteomic profiling, molecular imaging of
metabolism and hypoxia, and evaluation of therapy-induced changes in tumour
cells and the tumour microenvironment. Both cetuximab and bevacizumab inhibited
tumour growth in vivo, and this effect was associated with selectively perturbed
glucose metabolism and reduced hypoxic volumes based on PET/MRI imaging. Global
proteomic profiling of xenograft tumours (in presence of cetuximab, bevacizumab,
and combination treatments) revealed alterations in proteins involved in glucose,
lipid and fatty acid metabolism (e.g., GPD2, ATP5B, STAT3, FASN), as well as hypoxic
regulators and vasculogenesis (e.g., ATP5B, THBS1, HSPG2). These findings correlated
with western immunoblotting (xenograft lysates) and histological examination by
immunohistochemistry. These results define important mechanistic insight into
the dynamic changes in metabolic and hypoxic response pathways in colorectal
tumours following treatment with cetuximab and bevacizumab, and highlight the
ability of these therapies to selectively impact on tumour cells and extracellular
microenvironment.

INTRODUCTION

worldwide [1]. CRC continues to be a significant public
issue with >500,000 deaths worldwide attributed to
this disease annually. About 25% of patients present
with metastatic disease, and of this group, 50-75% will
have the disease confined to the liver [2-5]. Early stage
detection significantly improves the clinical outcome [6]

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in
men and women worldwide, with nearly 1.4 million new
cases diagnosed in 2012, representing 9.7% of cancers

although this is often made difficult by the lack of specific
symptoms [7]. With over 70% of CRC cases detected at
advanced stages, screening remains unsatisfactory and
non-specific [8]. Further, in patients who present initially
with early-stage disease, up to 50% will eventually
develop metastatic disease.
Significant advances have been made in the
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
[9]. Refinements to cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens
have incrementally improved median life expectancy
in patients with mCRC, however, such gains have
often been attributed with increased toxicity. Recent
treatment advances have recognized the role of
monoclonal antibodies in the management of mCRC
[10]. International guidelines recommend combination
chemotherapy with the addition of a monoclonal antibody
(i.e., bevacizumab) for the first-line treatment of mCRC,
while for chemoresistant mCRC, cetuximab (erbitux) or
panitumumab (vectibix) are recommended as treatment
of patients with wild-type K-Ras tumours. These targeted
agents, now validated in mCRC and other tumour types,
target and perturb critical cell-signalling pathways that
regulate (stimulate) tumour angiogenesis and growth.
Bevacizumab disrupts angiogenesis by binding
to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A,
reducing availability of this ligand to its receptors, and
preventing their activation. Based on pre-clinical models,
bevacizumab has been shown to have both anti-vascular
and anti-angiogenic effects, resulting in regression of
existing tumour vasculature [11-13], and inhibition of new
and recurrent tumour vessel growth [14, 15], respectively.
This results in a synergistic reduction in tumour size and
inhibition in tumour growth. Bevacizumab remains the
most important and well-studied drug among the known
anti-angiogenic agents. Bevacizumab was the first agent to
affect survival in patients with mCRC, improving survival
by 30% [16], with more recent phases II and III clinical
trials further demonstrating its significant beneficial effect
[17].
Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody, binds to the
extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed and active
in mCRC. EGFR, a receptor for EGF present on the
surface of normal epithelium, is overexpressed in up to
80% of colorectal tumours [18, 19]. EGFR mediates cell
differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and
apoptosis, all of which are deregulated in mCRC [20].
Cetuximab directly inhibits tumour growth, induction
of apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, inhibition of
metastasis, and also exerts anti-angiogenic effects by
blocking ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR on
endothelial cells [20, 21]. EGF blockade also interferes
with VEGF production by tumour cells, suggesting a
complementary anti-tumour effect during combination
therapies of cetuximab and bevacizumab [22, 23].
Interestingly, tumours with mutations in K-Ras are
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

associated with resistance to cetuximab therapy [24, 25].
This underscores the need to identify factors that can
predict response or resistance to cetuximab or other such
targeted therapies [25].
To explore the pharmacodynamics of bevacizumab
and cetuximab treatment, and further our understanding of
therapy-induced changes in tumour cells and the tumour
microenvironment, we profiled different human-derived
CRC xenografts following treatment with these agents
alone or in combination. The human CRC cell lines HT-29
and LIM1215 were utilised to investigate responsiveness
to bevacizumab/cetuximab monotherapy or combinationbased treatment using human xenograft models. Most
significantly, we demonstrate that these targeted
therapies had a selective effect on different tumour cells
(resistant/weakly responsive), resulting in changes in
tumour growth, metabolism, signalling, vasculature,
and tissue oxygenation. These findings contribute
towards understanding the underlying therapeutic and
biological processes associated with monoclonal therapy
of EGFR and VEGF anti-tumour activities, and identify
further potential protein markers that may contribute in
assessment of mCRC treatment response.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Cetuximab and bevacizumab are both approved for
the treatment of mCRC, however the mechanism of action
of both drugs and impact on signalling and metabolic
changes in both tumour cells and microenvironment are
not fully understood. We therefore explored the effects
of treatment of different human CRC models, HT-29
and LIM1215, grown as xenografts with cetuximab and
bevacizumab (in addition to combination treatment). To
directly monitor and characterise specific anti-tumour
activity, molecular imaging of metabolism and hypoxia,
proteomic profiling and immunohistochemistry were
employed.

Treatment of colorectal xenografts with cetuximab
and bevacizumab
To explore the effects of monotherapy as well
as combined therapeutic effect, we subcutaneously
injected LIM1215 or HT-29 cells into BALB/c mice,
and monitored tumour growth following treatment
with control (vehicle, PBS), cetuximab, bevacizumab
or cetuximab and bevacizumab combined. Cetuximab
and bevacizumab significantly inhibited HT-29 tumour
growth compared to control, although the combination of
cetuximab and bevacizumab did not provide additional
therapeutic benefit (Figure 1A). In LIM1215 tumours, the
significant growth inhibition observed with cetuximab and
bevacizumab treatment was more pronounced compared
to HT-29 tumours, and combination treatment also did not

demonstrate a significantly improved effect (Figure 1B).
These results are consistent with the known differences
in response of mCRC tumours to these therapeutics, and
highlight the therapeutic activity of EGFR and VEGF-A
antibodies in CRC.

LIM1215 tumours showed reduced hypoxic volumes
following treatment with cetuximab and bevacizumab,
more marked in the LIM1215 treated tumours. The
reduction in hypoxia reflects the effects of cetuximab
and bevacizumab on vasculature through both direct and
paracrine effects [25-27].

Glucose metabolism and hypoxia following
treatment

Immunohistochemistry analysis of tumours
GLUT-1 expression was reduced following
treatment by both bevacizumab and cetuximab, and
combination treatment, in both HT-29 and LIM1215
tumours, with cetuximab effect most markedly
observed in LIM1215 tumours (Figure 3). HIF-1alpha
expression was slightly reduced following treatment
with bevacizumab and cetuximab, and combination
in HT-29 tumours, however, a greater reduction was
observed in LIM1215 tumours (Figure 3), consistent

To evaluate the in vivo metabolism of tumours
following treatment, PET/MRI imaging of mice with
HT-29 and LIM1215 tumours at baseline and following
treatment was performed with 18F-FDG PET, and

in glycolytic volumes were found between treated and
control HT-29 tumours (Figure 2A), although reduced
glycolytic volumes were observed for treated LIM1215
tumours (Figure 2B). Both HT-29 (Figure 2C) and

following treatment with bevacizumab or cetuximab in
HT-29 tumours, but more marked reduction was seen
in LIM1215 tumours (Figure 3), also consistent with
the HIF-1alpha results. EGFR expression was reduced
following cetuximab treatment in HT-29 and LIM1215
tumours, and VEGF-A showed minimal change following

Proteome analysis of tumour xenograft-derived
lysates in response to drug treatments

In response to cetuximab and bevacizumab,
significant changes in tumour xenograft protein expression
were observed associated with cellular and glycolytic
metabolic processing (Table 1). Most notably, glycerol3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD2, Rsc –16.6) and ATP
Synthase (ATP5B, Rsc -25.7) (Figure 5) were significantly
reduced in expression following bevacizumab treatment
in LIM1215 and HT-29, respectively. Further, glucose
and glycolytic metabolic-related proteins including
STAT3, G6PD PGM1, ILF3, PC, and THBS1 were also

To gain insights into the tumour protein expression
changes following treatment with bevacizumab and
cetuximab we extracted xenograft-derived proteins and
performed in-depth proteome profiling using GeLC-MSMS. Protein visualisation using ImperialTM Protein Stain
indicates differences in HT-29 and LIM1215 tumourderived protein profiles in response to bevacizumab
and cetuximab, and combination treatments (Figure

significantly reduced in expression following bevacizumab
treatment in both LIM1215 and HT-29 tumours.
Citrate synthase (CS, Rsc -1.2) and fatty acid
synthase (FASN, Rsc -18.4) were reduced following
cetuximab treatment of HT-29 and LIM1215 tumour
xenografts, respectively (Table 1). Further, glucose and
glycolytic metabolic-related proteins including PYGB,
RBM14, LRPPRC, UGGT1, PFKP, HDLBP, ATP1A1,
GFPT1, PABPC1, and PC were also significantly reduced
in expression following cetuximab treatment in LIM1215
tumours. These findings are consistent with deregulated
tumour metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis,
TCA cycle, lipid synthesis) following bevacizumab
and cetuximab treatment, particularly in the more
responsive LIM1215 treated tumours. This also aligns
with the reduced FDG PET uptake (Figure 2A), and
immunohistochemistry (Figure 3), and suggests that the
metabolic changes are not fully explained by changes in
glucose transporter expression.
With regards to alterations in EGFR following
cetuximab treatment, several proteins were enriched
independently in LIM1215 (and not HT-29) following
cetuximab treatment, and were associated with cellular
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metabolism and signal transduction (Table 2). This
selective deregulation is possibly attributed to a reduced
response to cetuximab treatment in HT-29 tumours
(based on resistance/reduced sensitivity [31]), although
some downregulation of total EGFR following treatment
was shown (Figure 3). Increased expression of ATP5B
(Rsc 10.7), LDHA (Rsc 21.1), CS (Rsc 4.9), the ADPribosylation factors (ARF) 3/4/5 (Rsc 7.2-11.9) (Figure 5)
and RAB1A/B (Rsc 5.6-8.8) were observed. Interestingly,
ARF4 is known to interact with EGFR and mediate the
EGF-dependent signal pathway [32]. ARF4 is a critical
molecule that directly regulates cellular PLD2 activity,
and that this ARF4-mediated PLD2 activation stimulates
AP-1-dependent transcription in the EGF-induced
cellular response [33]. Interestingly, this was confirmed
using IHC with reduced total EGFR following cetuximab
treatment (data not shown). Further upregulated protein
classes included cytoskeleton-related proteins (TUBB4B,
TUBB, ACTR3), and the protein ENO1 (Rsc 7.9),
associated with glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle,
and lipid synthesis. This selective deregulation of various
metabolic-associated proteins is in agreement with
increased anaerobic metabolism as a prominent feature

observed in a syngenic model of acquired resistance to
anti-EGFR therapy in CRC [34].
For proteins down-regulated independently in
LIM1215 (and not HT-29) in response to cetuximab
treatment, various cellular metabolic-associated and
glycolytic-associated proteins were found (Table 2).
These included proteins associated with cellular and
lipid metabolism (FASN (Rsc -18.4)), cellular protein
metabolism (PABPC1 (Rsc -10.9), EIF3A/C (Rsc -6.16.8), EIF4G1 (Rsc -6.0)), and cellular metabolism/
glycolytic processing (DDOST (Rsc -6.8), UGGT1 (Rsc
-5.2), PFKP (Rsc -5.2)). Recently, EGFR has been shown
to promote glucose metabolism of chondrosarcoma cells
through the upregulation of glycolytic enzymes [35].
Interestingly, cisplatin-resistant chondrosarcoma cells
showed upregulated glucose metabolism and EGFR
signalling pathway. With regards to FASN expression
in response to cetuximab, FASN has been linked to
acquired docetaxel/trastuzumab/adriamycin resistance
in breast cancer or intrinsic gemcitabine and chemoor radiotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer. FASN
expression is significantly upregulated in pancreatic
cancer [36] and inhibition of FASN by siRNA or the FAS
inhibitor orlistat reduces gemcitabine resistance, whereas
ectopic overexpression of FASN contributes to intrinsic
resistance to gemcitabine and radiation [37, 38]. FASNinduced radiation resistance may result from decrease
in radiation-mediated ceramide production, leading to
reduced caspase 8-induced apoptosis. However, the
mechanism of FASN-induced gemcitabine resistance
remains to be elucidated [39]. FASN expression in normal
adult tissues is generally very low or undetectable, and
it is significantly upregulated and correlates with poor
prognosis in many types of cancer. The metabolic products
of the FASN complex are rapidly consumed by actively
dividing cells and recent data demonstrates that FASN
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression is important for tumour growth and survival,
suggesting that FASN is a metabolic oncogene [40].

Anti-tumour effects of cetuximab and
bevacizumab
mediated
through
altered
angiogenesis and hypoxia
In agreement with Figure 2C and 2D, we further
identified significant deregulation in comparison to vehicle
in protein expression associated with HT-29 and LIM1215
tumour xenograft treatments associated with altered
angiogenesis and hypoxia. With respect to angiogenesis
(Table 3), we observed upregulation in response to
cetuximab and bevacizumab (and combination) of 11
proteins in LIM1215 including ATP5B (Rsc 11.5/10.7),
ENO1 (Rsc 7.9/20.7) in both cetuximab and bevacizumab
(and combination), TGFBI (Rsc 4.9), STAT1 (Rsc 4.0),
ANPEP (Rsc 3.3), PTPN6 (Rsc 2.5), and TYMP (Rsc 2.5)
in cetuximab, and LDHB (Rsc 12.2), IDH2 (Rsc 10.1)
in bevacizumab. Although we observed only a marginal
therapeutic effect with HT-29 in response to cetuximab
and bevacizumab, we report that HSPG2 (Rsc 6.2/4.2) was
upregulated in response to cetuximab and bevacizumab
(Figure 5), and THBS1 (Rsc 12.2) in response to
bevacizumab. Interestingly, cetuximab treatment reduced
HSPG expression (Rsc -3.8) in LIM1215 (Figure 5), which
is involved in angiogenesis and cell-cell interactions.
Therefore, the protein expression changes in THBS1 and
HSPG align with altered vasculogenesis and cell-cell
interactions.
Hypoxia is recognized as an important factor
contributing to cancer development and drug resistance
[41-43]. With regards to hypoxia associated proteins
expression changes (based on increased tumour hypoxia
volume associated with HT-29, Figure 2C), we report

THBS1 (Rsc 12.2), SLC25A13 (Rsc 3.0), GFPT1 (Rsc
2.7), and NPEPPS (Rsc 2.4) were selectively upregulated
in response to cetuximab (Table 4). It has been shown that
hypoxia induced drug resistance occurs in gastric cancer
cells, whereby cetuximab enhanced oxaliplatin-induced
cytotoxicity and apoptosis in normoxia and caused a
reversal of drug resistance in hypoxia [44]. Cetuximab
was shown to inhibit HIF-1α expression via the MAPK/
ERK and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways and functions

to overcome drug resistance induced by hypoxia. In
response to bevacizumab, PDLIM1 (Rsc 9.1), FABP1 (Rsc
7.1), PSMA7 (Rsc 6.2), TCEB2 (Rsc 6.2), and ACAA2
(Rsc 5.2) were upregulated in HT-29 xenograft tumours
(Table 4). These data further support the IHC results
(Figure 3) of slightly reduced expression of HIF-1alpha,
and reduced hypoxic cell fractions observed on FMISO
PET (Figure 2C). These data are in partial agreement with
Selvakumaran et al., where bevacizumab-treated HT-29/

HCT116 xenograft tumours showed depletion of tumour
microvasculature (i.e., anti-angiogenesis), and increased
pimonidazole staining, consistent with an anti-angiogenic
effect and induction of hypoxia in tumours [45]. In
contrast, we found that HIF-1alpha was downregulated
following cetuximab treatment in LIM1215 tumours
(Figure 3), although both bevacizumab and cetuximab
showed reduced hypoxic fractions on FMISO PET (Figure
2D), and both treatments reduced CD31 expression
(Figure 3). These results indicate that cetuximab and
bevacizumab also have anti-angiogenic effects which can
result in alteration in vascular morphology and reduced
hypoxia in tumours.
In summary, our results provide new insights
into the interplay of signalling alterations and changes
in metabolism and hypoxia response pathways in
tumours following inhibition of VEGF and EGFR, and
the inhibitory effects on both tumour cells and tumour
microenvironment following treatment with cetuximab
and bevacizumab. Most significantly, we demonstrate that
these targeted therapies were selective on different tumour
cells (resistant/weakly responsive), resulting in changes in
tumour growth, metabolism, signalling, vasculature, and
tissue oxygenation. Future studies which include gene
knockdown and overexpression of proteins would provide
further evidence of the mechanistic effects of changes in
these identified altered proteins. These results identify
biologic mechanisms underlying the anti-tumourigenic
effects of cetuximab and bevacizumab in CRC, which
may lead to a better understanding of the links between
metabolism and tumourigenesis in cancer therapy and
identifying response markers for anti-tumourigenic
therapy.

The mice were identified by earmarks and weighed twice a
week. Tumours were measured twice a week using digital
callipers. Tumour volume (TV) was calculated as (length
x width2) / 2, where length was the longest axis and width
was the perpendicular measurement [50]. Tumour volumes
were expressed in mm3, and tumour growth curves were
established over time for each cell line. The animals were
euthanized when the TV reached 1000 mm3 or if there
were any signs of distress prior to this.

Therapy study
Treatment commenced when mean LIM1215
xenograft TV reached 208 mm3 and mean HT29 xenograft
TV was 140 mm3. Groups of 5 mice for each xenograft
model were randomly assigned to four treatment cohorts
and treated for two weeks with, (1) Vehicle – 100uL
PBS 2x/week; (2) cetuximab – 20 mg/kg 2x/week; (3)
bevacizumab – 10 mg/kg 2x/week; or (4) the combination
treatment both cetuximab (20 mg/kg) and bevacizumab
(10 mg/kg) 2x/week.
During therapy mice were imaged with 18F-FDG
18
and F-FMISO on a weekly basis before initial treatment,
at commencement (week 0), at week 1 and at week 2.
Tumour volumes were measured twice a week until mice
were culled when either tumours reached >1000mm3 or
if mice were deemed sick based on observation and/or
weight loss. One mouse from each cohort was sacrificed
when TV reached 200mm3, 500mm3, and 1000mm3,
after imaging with each PET radiotracer, and correlative
measurement of oxygenation was performed. For
proteomic profiling and validation studies, tumours (n
= 6) from three mice from each treatment cohort after 2
weeks were obtained, and tumours pooled in two separate
groups (experimental and validation) and samples stored
at -80 °C.
The animal care and experimentation were
performed according to the Australian Code of Practice
for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes
endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research
Council. The experimental protocols were approved by

was monitored by a pressure-sensitive pad adhered to the
abdomen. The MRI scan started with a whole body T1weighted 3D imaging, followed by T2-weighted sequence
over the tumour. Following PET list-mode acquisition,
the scans were reconstructed using the Tera-TOMO®
reconstruction provided by Mediso. Subsequently,
reconstructed PET and MR images were transferred to a
research PACS system where the images were retrieved
for processing by PMOD® for VOI markup.
The mice were sacrificed by over inhalation of
isoflurane, and then the tumours were dissected and
embedded in Tissue Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature
compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), frozen in
isopentone cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C,
until further analysis.

for

Four µm sections of the paraffin embedded tissue
from different treatment groups were mounted onto
SuperFrost® Plus slides (Menzel-Glaser, Braunschweig,
Germany), deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to
quenching of endogenous peroxidise using 3% H202 for
10min. Sections to be stained with GLUT-1 (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or HIF1-alpha (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) were boiled in a 100 oC citrate buffer
water bath for 30 min prior to 90 min ambient temperature
incubation with respective primary antibody. For CD31
(BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA), EGFR (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and VEGF-A (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) staining,
antibodies were applied to 5 µm frozen sections fixed in
4 oC acetone prior to application of primary antibody. To
allow visualization of the immunostaining, sections were
incubated with the Envision anti-rabbit-HRP conjugated
secondary antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and DAB
(Sigma, St. Louis MO, USA) and counterstained with
Mayer’s haematoxylin. Detection of CD31 antibody was
done with Vectastain (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, USA) ABC anti-rat-biotinylated secondary antibody.
The histologic appearance of the tissue sections stained
for various samples were confirmed with H&E staining.
Stained sections were scanned using the Aperio
(Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) Scanscope XT
and Aperio image analysis algorithms. For each section,
the percentage of positive cells were scored for staining
intensity as -, negative; +, weak; ++, moderate; and +++
strong, to give an overall H-score. CD31 was scored as
positive pixels in areas of viable tumour and presented as
a percentage of viable tumour area.

PET/MRI image analysis
The region of interest in each image (ROI) was
defined on T2-weighted MRI, and transferred onto all
PET images. For FDG PET, the Total Glycolytic Volume
(TGV) which is the sum of all glycolytic activity in
the tumour was calculated. For FMISO PET, the Total
Hypoxic Volume (THV), which is the 3D sum of hypoxic
uptake in the tumour, as well as the tumour to Normal
Ratio (TNR) of FMISO uptake was also calculated.

Protein extraction and quantification of tumour
xenografts
For each treatment cohort pooled tumour xenograft
samples (both experimental and validation) were
thawed on ice.. Total protein was harvested from three
independent tumour samples in each experimental group
(experimental and validation). For protein extraction, lysis
buffer (5 mL of (4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol and
0.01% (v/v) bromophenol blue, 0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH
6.8)) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, EDTAfree protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche) and 1 mM DTT
was combined with homogenised tumours and sonicated
for 180 s [49]. Homogenates in each experimental group
were incubated at 95°C for 20 min and 60°C for 2 h. After
centrifugation at 25,000g for 30 min, each supernatant
was subjected to quantification, performed as previously
described [29] based on 1D-SDS-PAGE / SYPRO® Ruby
protein staining densitometry. This quantification method
is reproducible, has a linear quantitation range over three
orders of magnitude [51], and is compatible with GeLCMS/MS [29, 52].

SDS-PAGE
Samples were prepared in Lämmli sample buffer
(0.06 M Tris-HCl, 2 % (w/v) SDS, 10 % (v/v) glycerol,
0.01 % bromophenol blue, pH 6.8) containing 50 mM DTT
and heated for 5 min at 95 ºC. Proteins were separated on
a 4-12 % NuPAGE® Novex Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen) at
150V at constant current.

Protein immunoblotting
For immunoblotting (10 μg), proteins were
electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using
the iBlot™ Dry Blotting System (Life Technologies) and
membranes blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in
Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (TTBS)
for 1 h. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies

validated using Percolator based on q-values at a 1% false
discovery rate (FDR) [29, 57]. With Proteome Discoverer,
peptide identifications were grouped into proteins
according to the law of parsimony and filtered to 1% FDR
[58]. Scaffold (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, v
4.3.4) was employed to validate MS/MS-based peptide
and protein identifications from database searching.
Initial peptide identifications were accepted if they could
be established at greater than 95% probability as specified
by the Peptide Prophet algorithm [58, 59]. Protein
identifications were accepted, if they reached greater
than 99% probability and contained at least 2 identified
unique peptides. These identification criteria typically
established < 1% false discovery rate based on a decoy
database search strategy at the protein level. Proteins that
contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated
based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy
the principles of parsimony. Contaminants, and reverse
identification were excluded from further data analysis.
UniProt was used to classify identified proteins based on
their annotated function, subcellular localisation [60]. The
Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org) was used as
an annotated resource to assess the tissue expression of
proteins identified in this study [61].

Proteomic analysis
Proteomic experiments were performed in duplicate.
Tumour xenograft lysates (20 µg) were separated using
SDS-PAGE and proteins visualized by Imperial™ Protein
Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each gel lane was cut
into 17 individual gel bands (1-2 mm width) and individual
gel slices destained (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate/
acetonitrile), reduced (10 mM DTT (Calbiochem) for 30
min), alkylated (50 mM iodoacetic acid (Fluka) for 30
min) and trypsinized (0.2 µg trypsin (Promega Sequencing
Grade) for 16 h at 37°C), as described [29, 53, 54]. RPHPLC was performed on a nanoAcquity® (C18) 150 ×
0.15-mm i.d. reversed phase UPLC column (Waters), using
an Agilent 1200 HPLC, coupled online to an LTQ-Orbitrap
mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion
source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) [55]. The column was
developed with a linear 60 min gradient with a flow rate of
0.8 μL/min at 45 °C from 0-100% solvent B where solvent
A was 0.1% (v/v) aqueous formic acid and solvent B was
0.1% (v/v) aqueous formic acid/60% acetonitrile. The
mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode
and survey MS scans (300–1500 Th) acquired with the
resolution set to a value of 30,000. Selected precursors
were fragmented by CID and real time recalibration
performed using a background ion from ambient air in
the C-trap [56]. Up to five of selected target ions were
dynamically excluded from further analysis for 3 min.

Semi-quantitative label-free spectral counting
Significant spectral count normalised (Nsc) and
fold change ratios (Rsc) were determined as previously
described [28, 29, 52, 54]. The relative abundance of a
protein within a sample was estimated using Nsc, where
for each individual protein, significant peptide MS/
MS spectra (i.e., ion score greater than identity score)
were summated, and normalised by the total number of
significant MS/MS spectra identified in the sample. To
compare relative protein abundance between samples the
ratio of normalised spectral counts (Rsc) was estimated.
Total number of spectra was only counted for significant
peptides identified (Ion score ≥ Homology score). When
Rsc is less than 1, the negative inverse value was used.
The number of significant assigned spectra for each
protein was used to determine whether protein abundances
between HT-29 and LIM1215 cells, and different drug
treatment categories (control, bevacizumab, cetuximab,
combination). For each protein the Fisher’s exact test
was applied to significant assigned spectra. The resulting
p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [62].

Database searching and protein identification
Raw data were processed using Proteome
Discoverer (v1.4.0.288, Thermo Fischer Scientific) and
searched with Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK;
v1.4.0.288), Sequest (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San
Jose, CA, v1.4.0.288), and X! Tandem (v2010.12.01.1)
against a database of 125,803 ORFs (UniProtHuman,
Feb-2015). Data was searched with a parent tolerance of
10 ppm, fragment tolerance of 0.6 Da, minimum peptide
length 6, maximum peptide length 144, and max delta CN
0.05. Peptide lists were generated from a tryptic digestion
with up to two missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation
of cysteines as fixed modifications, and oxidation of
methionines and protein N-terminal acetylation as variable
modifications. Peptide spectral matches (PSM) were

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-tests (GraphPad v5.0) were calculated,
with *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 considered statistically
significant.
