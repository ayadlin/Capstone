BACKGROUND. The efficacy and safety of chemotherapy with irinotecan plus docetaxel were retrospectively evaluated for olfactory neuroblastoma.
METHODS. Twelve patients with histologically proven advanced or metastatic olfactory neuroblastoma were treated with chemotherapy with irinotecan plus docetaxel at the study institution between 2001 and 2005. Of these, 7 patients with
locoregional disease and no prior radiotherapy received irinotecan plus docetaxel
followed by definitive radiotherapy, 1 with photon radiotherapy and 6 with proton radiotherapy, whereas 3 patients with distant metastases and 2 with locoregional disease who had received prior radiotherapy received irinotecan plus
docetaxel only.

RESULTS. The most common toxicities of grade 3 among the 12 patients receiving irinotecan plus docetaxel were leukopenia (33%), neutropenia (50%), febrile
neutropenia (8%), and diarrhea (25%), all of which were manageable. Partial
response was achieved in 3 patients, giving an overall response rate of 25%. The
response rate was higher in patients aged <50 years (3 of 4 patients) compared
with those aged >50 years (0 of 8 patients) (P 5 .018). With a median follow-up

CONCLUSIONS. Chemotherapy for olfactory neuroblastoma with irinotecan plus
docetaxel is safe and manageable. Patients aged <50 years may be sensitive to
chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy followed by definitive radiotherapy may
represent a promising option for patients with locally advanced olfactory neuroblastoma. Cancer 2008;112:885–91.  2008 American Cancer Society.

lfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), also known as esthesioneuroblastoma, is a rare tumor arising from the olfactory epithelium
of the upper nasal cavity.1,2 ONB accounts for 3% of all intranasal
tumors3 and its etiology is unknown. Since its first description by
Berger and Luc in 1924,4 approximately 1000 cases have been
reported in the literature.5 The sex distribution is roughly equal.2,5
Although several authors have demonstrated a bimodal distribution
in the age of diagnosis, with peaks in those aged 11 to 20 years and
51 to 60 years,2,6 others have described a unimodal distribution concentrating in the fifth decade of life.7

With regard to treatment, the combination of
surgery and radiotherapy is the most frequent
approach and offers the highest cure rates,8–12 but
definitive radiotherapy as a nonsurgical treatment
is also used.2,10,12–14 However, despite definitive local
treatment, local recurrence and distant metastases
are often reported,6,8,12 with the latter observed in
25% to 50% of cases.15–19 Chemotherapy is therefore often also implemented in patients with recurrent or metastatic ONB. Experience at several
institutions using various chemotherapeutic regimens has suggested that this tumor might be sensitive to chemotherapy,7,8,18,20–22 but its rarity has
prevented any clear determination of the role
of chemotherapy or the optimal chemotherapy
regimen.
Between 1995 and 2005, our group at the
National Cancer Center Hospital East treated 20
patients with either or both advanced or metastatic
ONB with chemotherapy. Results with a variety of
chemotherapy regimens used before 2001, including
platinum-based regimens,23 were unsatisfactory, leading us to speculate on the possibility of using irinotecan plus docetaxel (ID). In addition, in patients with
locoregional disease we adopted proton radiotherapy
after induction chemotherapy with ID because of its
lower radiotoxicity to adjacent tissues (brain, optic
nerve, eyeball, etc).24
Investigation of this regimen in 3 ONB patients
in a phase 1 study of ID for solid cancer produced a
good response in 2.25 The first, who had previously
received platinum-based chemotherapy at our institution, was responsive to ID, with a response duration of approximately 10 months. The second, a
chemotherapy-naive patient with locoregional disease, achieved a partial response with ID, and a
subsequent complete response (CR) after proton
radiotherapy after ID. We therefore decided to treat
not only recurrent or metastatic ONB but also locoregional ONB with ID, and since 2001 have treated 12
patients with this regimen. Of these, 7 with locoregional disease and no prior radiotherapy received ID
followed by definitive radiotherapy, namely, photon
radiotherapy in 1 patient and proton radiotherapy in
6 patients.
In this retrospective analysis, we evaluated the
efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy with ID for
ONB and the efficacy of ID followed by definitive
radiotherapy for locally advanced ONB. After suggestions from several authors that the pathologic features of ONB might correlate with prognosis and
response to chemotherapy,1,10,18,26–28 we also analyzed the correlation between response and the histologic grading of Hyams.28

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed the clinical records of the 12 patients
with ONB treated with ID at the National Cancer
Center Hospital East between 2001 and 2005. All 12
had histologically proven ONB and pathologic specimens were available for 10 patients. These were
reviewed according to the histologic grading system
of Hyams28, and the correlation between Hyams
grade and response to ID was analyzed.
Response to chemotherapy was evaluated using
the World Health Organization (WHO) standard
response criteria.29 Chemotherapy-related toxicities
were graded by the National Cancer Center Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2). Overall survival time was calculated from the initiation of
chemotherapy with ID to the date of death or last
follow-up, whichever occurred first. Progressionfree survival time was calculated from the initiation
of chemotherapy with ID to the documentation of
progression or death. Actuarial survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.30 Statistical
analysis of categoric data was performed using a
Fisher exact test. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < .05. All analyses were
conducted using the statistical analysis software
Stat View-J (version 5.0) for Windows (SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
The 4 males and 8 females ranged in age from 24 to
73 years, with a median age of 58.5 years. According
to the clinical staging system of Kadish and Wang,1 2
patients had stage B disease at the time of chemotherapy and 10 had stage C disease. The primary site
was determined by either or both computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging.
Intracranial invasion was noted in 5 patients, regional lymph node metastases in 6, and distant metastases in 3. The site of metastases in these 3
patients was the lung and liver; cervical lymph
node, lung, and bone; and cervical lymph node and
bone in 1 patient each. Of the 12 patients, 9 presented with locoregional disease and 3 initially presented with distant metastases. Of the 9 patients
with locoregional disease, 2 had received prior
radiotherapy, whereas 7 had not.
Of the 12 patients with histologically proven ONB,
specimens for pathologic review were available for 10.
Of these, 2 tumors were low grade (Hyams grade I/II)
and 8 were high grade (Hyams rade III/IV).

Treatment Results
Treatment results are also listed in Table 1. All 12
patients received chemotherapy with ID, given as 3
weekly administrations of both irinotecan at a dose
of 50 to 60 mg/m2 on Day 1 and docetaxel at a dose
of 30 to 35 mg/m2 on Day 1, repeated every 4 weeks.
The recommended dose of this regimen had been
previously determined as irinotecan at a dose of
50 mg/m2 and docetaxel at a dose of 30 mg/m2 in a
phase 1 study at our institution.25 Of the 12 patients,
3 had been recruited in this phase 1 study and the
other 9 were treated with ID in clinical practice after
the recommended dose had been determined. A median of 3 cycles of ID were given, ranging from 1 to 6
cycles. In the 7 patients with locoregional disease
and no prior radiotherapy, the treatment plan called
for ID followed by definitive radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was administered after a median of 3 cycles of
ID (range, 1–6 cycles). One patient refused further
administration of ID because his nasal bleeding was
not improved after 1 cycle and he wished to receive
definitive radiotherapy as soon as possible. A second
patient received 6 cycles of ID because she wished to
continue ID as long as a response was observed. The
other 5 patients received 2 or 3 cycles of ID. Of the 7
patients, the 1 patients with Kadish stage B disease
underwent definitive radiotherapy with photon radiation (total of 66 grays [Gy] in 2-Gy fractions),
whereas the 6 patients with Kadish stage C disease
received proton radiation (total of 65 cobalt Gray
equivalents [GyE] in 2.5-GyE fractions).
All 12 patients demonstrated an assessable
response to ID. Three of the 12 achieved a partial

response (PR). One PR patient had distant metastatic
disease and the other 2 PR patients had locoregional
disease. The median progression-free survival was
13.6 months (range, 1.3–53.4 months) (Fig. 1). In the
7 patients with locoregional disease and no prior
radiotherapy who received definitive radiotherapy
after chemotherapy, 5 achieved a CR and 2 a PR.
The median follow-up period in survivors was
22.2 months (range, 14.8–63 months). Estimated 1year and 2-year survival rates were 83.3% and 53.3%,
respectively. The median overall survival was 36.6
months (Fig. 2). The median survival of the 6 of 12
patients with recurrent or distant metastatic disease
was 16.1 months (Fig. 3). Of the 7 of 12 patients with
locoregional disease who had received no prior

radiotherapy, 1 received ID followed by photon radiation and 6 received ID followed by proton radiation.
Among them, the 2-year survival rate was 100% and
6 patients were alive at the time of last follow-up
(Fig. 4). Of the 5 CR patients who received definitive
radiotherapy (1 with photon radiation and 4 with
proton radiation), 4 patients were alive at the time of
last follow-up with no evidence of disease. Toxicity of
definitive photon or proton radiotherapy was mild
and manageable. None of the 7 patients experienced
treatment-related death or severe late toxicity due to
irradiation, including vision impairment, brain necrosis, or others. Nevertheless, ongoing follow-up to
ensure safety is required.
The most common grade 3 or 4 chemotherapyrelated toxicities were leukopenia (33%), neutropenia
(50%), febrile neutropenia (8%), and diarrhea (25%),
all of which were manageable.

The correlation between response to chemotherapy and clinical and histologic variables is summarized in Table 2. The response rate to ID was 75% (3
of 4 patients) in the group aged <50 years, but was
0% (0 of 8 patients) in those aged >50 years
(P 5 .018). Furthermore, the response rate was 60%
(3 of 5 patients) in patients with intracranial invasion, but was 0% (0 of 7 patients) in those without
(P 5 .045). Although the sample size was small, no
response was observed (0 of 2 patients) in the Hyams
low-grade (grade I/II) patients, whereas 3 responses
were observed (3 of 8 patients) in the Hyams highgrade (grade III/IV) patients. No significant correlations between response to chemotherapy and other
clinical variables were identified.

DISCUSSION
As ONB is a rare tumor, and to our knowledge no
consensus exists regarding treatment, particularly for
advanced cases. Review of the literature suggests that
ONB is a surgical disease; the advent of craniofacial
resection has clearly improved disease-free survival6,15 and many authors recommend surgery as
the initial treatment.8,12,31,32 To improve locoregional
control and survival, several authors recommend
surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy.10,12,31–33
Together, these reports suggest that the optimal
treatment for surgically resectable cases is surgery
followed by adjuvant radiotherapy.
Of our 12 patients with ONB, 5 had recurrent
disease, 3 had intracranial invasion, 1 each had cervical lymph node metastases and distant metastases,
and 2 were staged as Kadish B. Because these Kadish
stage B patients declined surgery, treatment was
initiated with chemotherapy and, if the disease was
locoregional, continued with definitive radiotherapy
after chemotherapy with ID.
Many authors have commented on the effectiveness of chemotherapy in the treatment of
ONB.7,12,14,18,19,34–37 Notwithstanding that these previous reports were based on single-institution experience with relatively small sample sizes, platinumbased chemotherapy was well regarded and considered effective.14,36,37 We previously reported that 2 of
8 ONB patients responded to chemotherapy with
mainly platinum-based regimens.23 In our present
analysis in 12 patients treated with ID, the response
was also 25% (3 of 12 patients), but toxicities were
mild and manageable. The median survival in the
setting of recurrent or metastatic disease was
approximately 12 months in previous reports,22,31 but
was 16.1 months in the current study. Although our
sample size was small (n 5 6), this result might indicate that chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic
ONB contributes to improving survival.
On univariate analysis, response rates to ID were
significantly higher in patients aged <50 years and
those with intracranial invasion. Rates for high-grade
(Hyams grade III/IV) and low-grade (Hyams grade I/
II) ONB were 37.5% (3 of 8 patients) and 0% (0 of 2
patients), respectively, but this difference was not
statistically significant. Several authors have reported
that the pathologic features of ONB correlate with its
prognosis and response to chemotherapy,1,10,18,26–28
whereas McElroy et al.18 suggested that high-grade
ONB (Hyams grade III/IV) may be sensitive to chemotherapy. Data from the current study may also suggest that ONB in younger patients and in those with
aggressive disease extension may be sensitive to
chemotherapy. The question of which subset of ONB

889

patients will respond to chemotherapy is important
but remains to be answered. The ability to predict
response will allow the identification of those
patients who should receive chemotherapy before
definitive radiotherapy. Our present and previous
reports may suggest that younger patients, those
with aggressive disease extension, and those with
high-grade histology (Hyams grade III/IV) may be
sensitive to chemotherapy.1,10,18,26–28 ONB is a rare
disease, and identification of the clinical determinants of a response to chemotherapy will require the
further accumulation of patients.
Although craniofacial resection is effective in
controlling ONB, it is not without substantial risk
and morbidity. Levine et al.38 reported that of 27
patients undergoing this treatment, 20% experienced
cerebrospinal fluid leakage and 12% had symptomatic postoperative pneumocephalus. Similarly,
Richtsmeier et al.39 reported 1 death and 9 major intracranial complications among a total of 26 patients.
Radiotherapy as the initial treatment has been proposed as 1 means of obviating these complications.
Elkon et al.2 found that radiotherapy and surgery
provided equivalent results in patients with earlystage disease. Similarly, a review from the Mayo
Clinic indicated no significant difference in survival
between patients receiving either radiotherapy or
surgery alone.10 However, recurrence with radiotherapy alone was approximately 60%.2,33 Bhattacharyya
et al.13 reported excellent results in 9 cases of esthesioneuroblastoma (olfactory neuroblastoma) or neuroendocrine carcinoma treated using induction
chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide followed
by proton radiotherapy, with 8 of 9 patients exhibiting a dramatic response to therapy and remission of
their tumor, which obviated the need for resection.
Fitzek et al.14 also reported promising results with the
combination of induction chemotherapy and protonphoton radiotherapy for patients with advanced ONB.
Nineteen patients with a sinonasal tumor (10 olfactory
neuroblastoma and 9 neuroendocrine carcinoma)
received chemotherapy with 2 courses of cisplatin
and etoposide, followed by high-dose proton-photon
radiotherapy to 69.2 GyE. Thirteen of the 19 responded to chemotherapy, with a 5-year survival rate
of 74% and 5-year local control rate from the time of
initial treatment of 88%. These findings demonstrated the possibility of nonsurgical treatment for
ONB.
Nevertheless, radiotherapy for ONB is challenging because of the surrounding critical organs, including the optic pathway, brain, and brainstem.
Thanks to its physical characteristics, proton
radiotherapy provides better dose distribution than

890

CANCER

photon radiotherapy, and is deemed a feasible and
effective treatment modality for curative high-dose
irradiation to the tumor volume without any increase
in normal tissue toxicity.24 We therefore used proton
radiotherapy in cases in which the potential for
damage to surrounding critical organs with photon
radiotherapy could not be ruled out. To facilitate prevention to surrounding critical organs, we adopted
induction chemotherapy with ID for locoregional
ONB. Thus, ID was followed by photon radiation
therapy of 66 Gy in 2-Gy fractions in 1 of 7 locoregional ONB patients and by proton radiotherapy of 65
GyE in 2.5-GyE fractions in 6 patients. The patient
receiving photon radiation achieved a CR, as did 4 of
the 6 patients receiving proton radiotherapy, with the
other 2 achieving PRs. At a median follow-up of 22.2
months, 6 of these 7 patients with locoregional ONB
who received ID followed by definitive radiotherapy
were still alive and the 2-year survival rate was 100%.
These findings suggest that induction chemotherapy
followed by definitive radiotherapy may be a promising nonsurgical treatment option for patients with
locally advanced ONB.
In conclusion, chemotherapy with ID for both
advanced and/or metastatic ONB was found to be
safe and manageable. The response to ID was no
better than expected, however, indicating that ONB
requires a more active chemotherapy regimen.
Induction chemotherapy followed by proton radiotherapy may be a promising treatment option for
patients with locally advanced ONB and warrants
further investigation.
