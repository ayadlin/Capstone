Abstract:

Cancer cells re-program their metabolic machinery in order to satisfy their
bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements. A critical aspect of the re-programming
of cancer cell metabolism involves changes in the glycolytic pathway (referred to
as the “Warburg effect”). As an outcome of these changes, much of the pyruvate
generated via the glycolytic pathway is converted to lactic acid, rather than being
used to produce acetyl-CoA and ultimately, the citrate which enters the citric acid
cycle. In order to compensate for these changes and to help maintain a functioning
citric acid cycle, cancer cells often rely on elevated glutamine metabolism.
Recently, we have found that this is achieved through a marked elevation of
glutaminase activity in cancer cells. Here we further consider these findings and
the possible mechanisms by which this important metabolic activity is regulated.

Rho
GTPases
and
cellular
metabolism
in
malignant
transformation

GTPases have been shown to be capable of growing under
conditions of serum deprivation and in the absence of a
substratum (i.e. anchorage-independent growth), as well
as inducing tumor formation when injected into immunocompromised mice [5-7]. The over-expression of Rho
GTPases has been reported in tumors of the colon, lung,
and in advanced stage breast cancers, in testicular germ
cell and urinary tract tumors, and in pancreatic cancer [814]. Two members of the family, RhoA and RhoC, have
been implicated in metastasis [15-18], and the expression
of the Rho-GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP) DLC1
(for Deleted in Liver Cancer 1) is suppressed in liver
cancer tissue and in a number of other cancers [19,20].
Thus, collectively these findings make the Rho GTPases
and their regulatory proteins attractive candidates for
targets of intervention in human cancer.

Our initial efforts to identify novel small molecule
inhibitors that block malignant transformation were
directed at Rho family GTPase-signaling pathways. There
were a number of reasons for this, perhaps foremost being
that our laboratory has been studying the small GTPase
Cdc42, as well as the closely related proteins Rac, and
RhoA, and their signaling partners for a number of years.
Signals originating from members of this GTPase family
have been shown to be important for a broad array of cellular
processes ranging from actin cytoskeletal rearrangements
to cell polarity, migration, and cell-cycle progression [1].
However, these GTPases have also been implicated in a
variety of diseases and developmental disorders, with a
number of lines of evidence linking Rho family members
to cancer [2]. For example, their hyper-activation as it
occurs either through mutations or the de-regulation
of their upstream activators, i.e. guanine nucleotide
exchange factors which catalyze the exchange of GDP
for GTP on these GTPases (such as members of the Dbl
family of oncoproteins), results in cellular transformation
[3,4]. Cells expressing constitutively active forms of Rho

A
surprising
connection
between Rho GTPase-induced
cellular transformation and
cellular metabolic activity
We have recently discovered a new role for Rho
GTPases in cancer progression through a previously
unappreciated connection to cellular metabolism [21].

In particular, we have found that the hyper-activation of
Cdc42 as well as related Rho GTPases (e.g. Rac1, RhoA
and RhoC) signals the activation of a mitochondrial
enzyme, glutaminase, that plays a key role in glutamine
metabolism by hydrolyzing glutamine to glutamate and
ammonia. The importance of cellular metabolism in the
development of cancer is rooted in the early observations
of Warburg that tumor cells exhibit enhanced glycolytic
activity (i.e. the “Warburg effect”) [22]. This phenomenon
has been receiving a great deal of renewed attention [2326].
Cancer cells undergo marked changes in metabolic
activity in order to sustain their malignant phenotypes
(Figure 1). One such set of changes is the up-regulation
of the expression of enzymes in the glycolytic pathway,
thus accelerating many of the reactions in this pathway.
However, importantly, the penultimate step in glycolysis,
the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate,
catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase, is attenuated
(rather than accelerated) in cancer cells [24,25]. This occurs
as a result of the tyrosine phosphorylation of a specific
isoform of pyruvate kinase (M2) that is preferentially
expressed in cancer cells, as well as in embryonic cells,
but not in differentiated cells [24,25,27]. The net outcome

of this attenuation is that pyruvate is generated through
a unique enzymatic mechanism that is uncoupled from
ATP production and involves the phosphorylation of
phosphoglycerate mutase by phosphoenolpyruvate
[26]. Pyruvate, when produced through this “alternative
glycolytic pathway”, is converted primarily to lactic acid,
rather than acetyl-CoA for citrate synthesis, with citrate
then normally entering the citric acid cycle. The increased
production of lactic acid by cancer cells, as a result of
these changes in the glycolytic pathway, was a seminal
observation of Warburg’s nearly 80 years ago, and reflects
one aspect of the metabolic remodeling that frequently
accompanies cellular transformation.
A second major set of changes in cancer metabolism
that helps to accommodate the alterations in the glycolytic
pathway, results in a shift to increased rates of glutamine
metabolism. This occurs through the accelerated
hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, as catalyzed by
mitochondrial glutaminase activity, and the subsequent
conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate, catalyzed by
glutamate dehydrogenase. The enhanced production of
α-ketoglutarate that is the outcome of elevated glutamine
metabolism helps to maintain the citric acid cycle in cancer
cells, particularly given the loss of the input from pyruvate

Figure 1: Metabolic remodeling of cancer cells Schematic highlights key differences in many cancer cells compared to
normal tissue. Normal cells use glycolysis prior to respiration in the mitochondria (yellow) and complete breakdown of glucose by the

tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (green). In cancer cells, glycolysis becomes the primary mode of glucose metabolism resulting in lactate and
its secretion. The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and attenuates pyruvate acetyl-CoA conversion
while glutaminolysis provides the cancer cell with an alternate source of biosynthetic precursors, fueling the TCA cycle with glutamine-derived
α-keto-glutarate. The anti-tumor drug 968 inhibits glutamine metabolism by inhibiting the enzyme glutaminase (GLS).

2), caused it to be ineffective at inhibiting transformation.
We went on to show that the target of 968 is glutaminase
C (GAC), a specific carboxy-terminal splice variant form
of kidney-type glutaminase (GLS1), which is one of two
known mammalian glutaminase enzymes (the other being
the “liver-type” or GLS2), found in kidney and a variety
of other tissues including a number of types of cancer cells
[29]. We then demonstrated that targeting GAC, either
through the use of the small molecule inhibitor 968 or by
RNAi, blocks the growth and invasive activity of various
human breast cancer cells, as well as a variety of other
types of human cancer cell lines.
We will now consider some of the outstanding
questions regarding the regulation of glutaminase activity
in cancer cells, and how intervention at the level of this
enzyme and glutamine metabolism might offer new
avenues for therapeutic intervention against cancer.

that is generated via glycolysis in normal (non-cancerous)
cells. Metabolic flux experiments using 13C-NMR have
demonstrated that while proliferating cancer cells exhibit a
pronounced Warburg effect, their citric acid cycle remains
intact and serves to replenish metabolic intermediates
necessary for the production of NADPH for fatty acid
synthesis, to provide the carbon source for nucleotide
synthesis as well as for the production of asparagine and
arginine, and to serve as a major anaplerotic source of
oxaloacetate [23,28]. Thus, cancer cells are often referred
to as being “glutamine addicted”, as they typically are
extremely sensitive to glutamine deprivation and hence
cannot proliferate in cell culture without it.
Our recent work suggests that the glutamine
addiction of cancer cells is enabled by the activation
of glutaminase, which catalyzes one of the key steps in
glutamine metabolism, as an outcome of post-translational
modifications. This discovery stemmed from the screening
for small molecule inhibitors that blocked the ability of
different constitutively active Rho GTPases, as well as
oncogenic Dbl, to transform fibroblasts. These efforts led
to our identification of a small molecule inhibitor of Rho
GTPase-dependent cellular transformation, designated
as 968, that is a member of the benzophenanthridinone
family. As shown in Figure 2, 968 was very effective at
blocking Dbl-induced focus formation, whereas very
subtle changes in the molecule, such as the removal of
bromine from the phenyl ring (i.e. molecule 335 in Figure

Regulation of glutaminase in
transformed cells and cancer
cells
There are two obvious mechanisms by which an
enzymatic activity might be increased in cancer cells; one
is by up-regulating the expression of the enzyme such that
its protein levels in cancer cells greatly exceed the levels
in non-transformed differentiated cells, and the other is
by directly regulating the enzyme’s activity. Indeed,

it was reported by Gao et al. that glutaminase (GAC)
expression was up-regulated in a c-Myc-dependent
manner in human B lymphoma and prostate cancer cells
[30]. Similarly, we found that the expression levels of
GAC were significantly increased in MDA-MB231 cells,
a highly aggressive breast cancer cell line, compared to
normal mammary epithelial cells [21]. However, at least
in the case of MDA-MB231 cells, the up-regulation
of GAC cannot fully account for the changes in its
enzymatic activity that we observed. Specifically, whereas
the basal levels of activity for recombinant preparations
of GAC are typically < 5% of the activity measured in
the presence of 50-100 mM inorganic phosphate, which
serves as an allosteric activator of the enzyme, the basal
activity measured in mitochondrial fractions from these
breast cancer cells is generally 30-50% of the maximal
activity assayed in the presence of inorganic phosphate.
Thus, the basal glutaminase activity is disproportionately
increased in MDA-MB231 cells compared to the basal
activity for the purified recombinant protein. Moreover,
glutaminase activity is markedly increased in different
transformed fibroblasts and in other cancer cells compared
to their non-transformed counterparts, in the absence
of any apparent changes in the expression levels of the
enzyme. A good example comes from our studies of Dbltransformed NIH-3T3 cells where the basal glutaminase
activity is 5-10 fold higher than the corresponding activity
measured in control (non-transformed) fibroblasts,
whereas the enzyme activities for these two sets of cells
were essentially identical when assayed in the presence
of 100 mM inorganic phosphate. Thus, the total levels of
glutaminase are essentially equivalent in Dbl-transformed
cells compared to control fibroblasts; however, the basal
enzyme activity is significantly greater in the transformed
cells. The same was found to be true in the human breast
cancer SKBR3 cell line.
An even more compelling indication that basal
glutaminase activity is increased in transformed/cancer
cells, independent of changes in the expression levels
of the enzyme, comes from experiments where we
ectopically expressed GAC in Dbl-transformed cells and
normal fibroblasts. We found that ectopically expressed,
epitope-tagged GAC, when immunoprecipitated from
transformed cells, exhibited significantly higher basal
enzyme activity compared to an equivalent amount of the
epitope-tagged enzyme immunoprecipiated from normal
cells. These findings provided us with our first clue that
glutaminase might be post-translationally modified in
transformed/cancer cells and that the modification(s)
could explain the activation of its (basal) enzymatic
activity, thereby providing a molecular link to the elevated
glutamine metabolism exhibited by these cells.

An important clue regarding how GAC is activated in
transformed/cancer cells came from our finding that when
the immunoprecipitated enzyme from Dbl-transformed
cells was first treated with alkaline phosphatase prior to
assaying its enzymatic activity, virtually all of its basal
activity (but not the inorganic phosphate-stimulated
activity) was eliminated. This suggested that GAC is
phosphorylated in transformed/cancer cells and that this
is responsible for the marked increase in its basal activity.
Transformed cells and cancer cells treated with 968 did
not exhibit elevated basal glutaminase activity. Kinetic
studies performed using purified recombinant GAC
indicated that 968 is neither competing with the binding
of substrate (glutamine) nor inorganic phosphate (21).
Apparently, 968 acts in an allosteric manner to prevent
the activation of GAC in cells by blocking the posttranslational modification(s) responsible for activating the
enzyme. This would explain how the inhibitory effects
of 968 are sustained through the isolation of transformed
cells and cancer cells through the washes that are
performed to isolate mitochondrial fractions. Moreover,
by blocking a post-translational modification(s) that
occurs predominantly in transformed/cancer cells, and not
in normal (non-cancerous) cells, it is easier to understand
why this small molecule inhibitor shows such specificity
for transformed/cancer cells in terms of its inhibitory
effects.

The role of NFκB
An important remaining question concerns how
the hyper-activation of Rho GTPase-signaling events,
which leads to cellular transformation and the induction
of malignant phenotypes in various human cancer cells,
results in the activation of a mitochondrial metabolic
enzyme. Because the increase in basal glutaminase
activity occurred in cells transformed by different Rho
GTPases (i.e. Cdc42, Rac, and RhoC), and given that each
of these GTPases signal through distinct groups of target/
effector proteins, we examined whether NFκB might be
involved, as it had been reported that a number of Rho
GTPases were capable of activating this transcription
factor [31,32]. In addition, NFκB was shown to be
essential for Dbl-induced transformation and has been
implicated in a variety of human cancers, in particular
breast cancer [33,34], making it an especially attractive
candidate given that a number of different breast cancer
cells lines were highly sensitive to 968. In fact, we
discovered that blocking NFκB activation with a small
molecule that inhibits the degradation of its negative
regulator IKBα, as well as knocking-down the expression
of the large NFκB subunit, p65/RelA, by RNAi markedly
inhibited the activation of glutaminase in Dbl-transformed
cells and in breast cancer cells. However, this raises one
of a number of pressing questions for the future, namely,
how does NFκB activate basal glutaminase activity in

occur in cancer cells not treated with this small molecule
inhibitor. These are questions that are now being actively
pursued in our laboratory.

Questions for the future

Implications
for
therapeutic strategies

NFκB is a well-known transcription factor that has
been linked to a wide range of cellular and biological
activities including the survival and migration of cancer
cells. In the absence of growth factor- or cytokine-signaling
activities, NFκB remains in the cytosol associated with a
negative regulatory protein IκBα. However, when growth
factor/cytokine-signaling pathways are activated, IκBα is
phosphorylated and degraded, thereby freeing NFκB to
translocate to the nucleus and promote the expression of a
number of genes. While the increases in basal glutaminase
activity in transformed/cancer cells are dependent on
NFκB activity, we know that this is not the result of a
direct effect of this transcription factor on glutaminase
expression. Indeed, even the enzymatic activity of
ectopically expressed GAC is markedly increased in
Dbl-transformed cells and this activation is dependent
on NFκB. The implication would then be that NFκB is
up-regulating either the expression of a growth factor (or
cytokine), a protein kinase, and/or a regulatory protein
that is essential for the activation of GAC. Recent 2D-gel
electrophoresis experiments are consistent with the
idea that post-translational modifications of ectopically
expressed GAC that are unique to transformed/cancer
cells, are responsible for the activation of the enzyme,
and that the binding of 968 blocks these activating
modifications (J. Wang, unpublished observations). An
important goal of our future studies will be to identify
the post-translational modification site(s) that leads to the
activation of glutaminase in transformed/cancer cells, as
this will hopefully provide clues toward understanding the
mechanism by which NFκB regulates enzyme activity.
Of course, a number of additional important
questions will need to be addressed. In particular, we
would like to obtain structural information that sheds some
light on how glutaminase is activated in transformed/
cancer cells. It has been suggested that GLS1 undergoes
an oligomeric transition from an inactive dimer to an
active tetramer upon the binding of inorganic phosphate
[35]. Does phosphorylation and/or some other type of
post-translational modification of GAC help to promote
the dimer-to-tetramer transition in cancer cells? If so, is
this transition being driven by a combination of the posttranslational modification of the enzyme and the binding
of inorganic phosphate or another metabolite that might
act as an activator in cells? How does the binding of the
small molecule 968 block this activation event? Thus
far, we have not found 968 to inhibit the ability of high
concentrations of inorganic phosphate (i.e. 100 mM) to
induce the dimer-to-tetramer transition in GAC. However,
968 might still prevent the enzyme from undergoing
this transition in response to lower levels of inorganic
phosphate or a specific metabolite, as might otherwise

future

The fact that inhibiting the activation of glutaminase
in transformed/cancer cells with the small molecule
968 has specific effects on the growth, migration and
invasive activity of these cells, without affecting the
growth or morphology of their non-transformed cellular
counterparts, offers exciting new possibilities for
therapeutic intervention. The conventional thinking has
been that the over-expression of growth factor receptors
and their signaling partners gives rise to excessive
signaling events that result in malignant transformation
and cancer progression [36-38]. Consequently, a number
of therapeutic strategies have been directed at inhibiting
receptor activation and function, both through the use of
tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies [3943]. Some of these strategies have shown some promise,
although many of these cancers become resistant to such
treatments, and there remains a need for the identification
of additional druggable targets that will permit multipronged strategies for therapeutic intervention against a
number of human malignancies. The ability of the small
molecule 968 to alter the unique metabolic fluxes that are
necessary for cancer cells to satisfy their biosynthetic and
energetic requirements opens the door to novel approaches
for intervention against the malignant state. In this regard
it is especially noteworthy that 968 blocks the activation of
a metabolic enzyme that is selectively activated in cancer.
Thus far, the early studies in mouse xenograft models show
that the intraperitoneal injection of the small molecule
968 shrinks the tumors in these animals without obvious
adverse effects (21). Therefore, targeting glutaminase as
well as other enzymes responsible for the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells could offer some exciting
and highly specific strategies for intervention against
malignancies manifesting glutamine addiction.
