In Brief
Ham et al. show that MYCN-amplified
neuroblastomas are sensitive to
treatment with the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT199 due to MYCN-driven increase of
NOXA. Combination treatment with the
Aurora Kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 and
ABT-199 is synergistic in xenograft
models of this tumor type, in part via
reducing MCL-1.

SUMMARY

Fewer than half of children with high-risk neuroblastoma survive. Many of these tumors harbor high-level
amplification of MYCN, which correlates with poor disease outcome. Using data from our large drug screen
we predicted, and subsequently demonstrated, that MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas are sensitive to the
BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199. This sensitivity occurs in part through low anti-apoptotic BCL-xL expression,
high pro-apoptotic NOXA expression, and paradoxical, MYCN-driven upregulation of NOXA. Screening for
enhancers of ABT-199 sensitivity in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas, we demonstrate that the Aurora Kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 combines with ABT-199 to induce widespread apoptosis. In diverse models of
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, including a patient-derived xenograft model, this combination uniformly
induced tumor shrinkage, and in multiple instances led to complete tumor regression.
INTRODUCTION
There are now a number of successful targeted therapies that
treat genetically distinct cancers (reviewed in Huang et al.,
2014). Unfortunately, many cancer subtypes are not yet
amenable to targeted therapy treatment, including cancers

with well-defined driver oncogenes. For example, KRAS mutations are found at high rates in lung, colorectal, and pancreatic
cancer, and inhibiting KRAS in these cancers causes tumor
growth inhibition (Sunaga et al., 2011; Zorde Khvalevsky et al.,
2013). However, KRAS, like most non-kinase driving oncogenes,
is not currently pharmacologically targetable. Alternative means

Significance
Targeted therapies are now being developed for a subset of neuroblastomas with ALK mutations. However, MYCN pathway
inhibitors have proved difficult to develop. We demonstrate that the presence of MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma exhibits synthetic lethality when treated with the BCL-2 targeting agent ABT-199, and that these tumors are further sensitized
by the addition of the Aurora A inhibitor, MLN8237, in cell culture models and diverse mouse models. In contrast, MYCN-WT
neuroblastoma cell culture models and human xenografts proved insensitive to this combination. Therefore, exploiting the
paradoxical apoptosis-promoting function of MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma could be an effective strategy for the
development of better therapies. ABT-199/MLN8237 combination therapy is differentially effective in the high-risk,
MYCN-amplified subset of neuroblastoma.

of blocking KRAS, such as synthetic lethal approaches or combined inhibition of important downstream pathways, are being
pursued to treat these cancers (reviewed in McCormick, 2015).
Neuroblastoma is a neural-crest-derived cancer and is the
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children aged 1–4
years (Gao et al., 1997). High-level amplifications of the MYCN
oncogene is observed in about 20% of cases, and has long
been associated with high-risk disease and poor outcome in
neuroblastoma (Huang and Weiss, 2013). MYCN encodes an
E-BOX-binding, basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHLZ) transcription factor that is enriched in the nervous system.
In these cancers, MYCN is a bona fide oncogenic driver (Burkhart et al., 2003; Weiss et al., 1997) and, similar to KRAS in
KRAS-driven tumors, preclinical inhibition of MYCN protein
leads to tumor growth inhibition in neuroblastoma mouse
models (Brockmann et al., 2013; Burkhart et al., 2003; Delehouze et al., 2014; Faisal et al., 2011; Gustafson et al., 2014;
Puissant et al., 2013). However, MYCN is not amenable to direct
pharmacologic inhibition, and preclinical efficacy of indirectly
targeting MYCN has largely been modest (Brockmann et al.,
2013; Chipumuro et al., 2014; Gustafson et al., 2014; Puissant
et al., 2013). As such, augmenting treatment efficacy for this
high-risk group will likely require the development of additional
rational therapies based on targetable pathways specifically
activated in neuroblastomas with MYCN amplification. To this
point, while MYCN has the pro-growth and pro-survival characteristics of a classical oncogene, MYCN also has the ability to
promote apoptosis (Chen et al., 2010; Fulda et al., 1999; Petroni
et al., 2011; Veschi et al., 2012).
The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) is a
comprehensive drug susceptibility discovery program that we
have developed to help identify therapeutic strategies for genetically defined subsets of cancer (Garnett et al., 2012; Yang et al.,
2013). Previous studies building on the GDSC findings have revealed sometimes unsuspected susceptibilities, such as the
sensitivity of Ewing sarcomas driven by a EWS-FLI1 translocation to PARP inhibitors (Garnett et al., 2012), the response of
KRAS and BRAF mutant colorectal cancers to simultaneous
MCL-1/BCL-xL/BCL-2 inhibition (Faber et al., 2014), and the
response of TP53/RB-deleted small-cell lung cancers to the
BH3 mimetic ABT-263 upon TORC1/2 inhibitor addition (Faber
et al., 2015). Here, we investigate potential therapeutic opportunities for MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.
RESULTS
MYCN-Amplified Neuroblastoma Cells Are Highly
Sensitive to ABT-263, due to High NOXA
Analysis of drug-sensitivity data of 500 solid tumor cancer cell
lines from a high-throughput drug screen (Garnett et al., 2012)
indicated that among all solid tumor types, neuroblastoma cell
lines were exquisitely sensitive to the in-clinic BCL-2/BCL-2/xL
inhibitor ABT-263 (navitoclax) (Figure 1A). Intriguingly, this sensitivity was specific only to neuroblastoma cells with MYCN amplification (Figure 1B). In fact, among 130 experimental and clinical
drugs, MYCN-amplified cell lines (20/26 of which were neuroblastoma cell lines) showed the most significant shift in half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) toward sensitivity with ABT-263
than any other drug compared with MYCN-WT cell lines (Table
160 Cancer Cell 29, 159–172, February 8, 2016 ª2016 The Authors

S1, top 39 by IC50 shift listed). To explore the underlying etiology
for this exquisite sensitivity of MYCN-amplified cell lines, we
examined expression levels of BCL-2 family members that are
known to modulate the sensitivity to ABT-263 by interrogating a
database of 20 MYCN-amplified and 81 MYCN-WT neuroblastoma primary tumors (Wang et al., 2006). This analysis uncovered
the MCL-1 inhibitor NOXA, encoded by PMAIP1, to be significantly higher in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas (Figures 1C,
1D, and S1A–S1C). The paradoxical nature of PMAIP1 upregulation in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma is underscored by the fact
that PMAIP1 expression was sharply decreased in stage 4 MYCNWT neuroblastomas compared with stage 1–3 MYCN-WT neuroblastomas (Figure 1E), consistent with the widely noted suppression of pro-apoptotic proteins as cancers progress (reviewed in
Hata et al., 2015). High expression of PMAIP1 in the subset of
MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas was confirmed in a second dataset of neuroblastomas (Janoueix-Lerosey et al., 2008), again
without differential expression of other key BCL-2 family members
(Figure S1D). In addition, gene expression datasets from medulloblastoma tumors (Kool et al., 2008; Northcott et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2012), a pediatric cancer in which MYCN is often amplified (Ryan et al., 2012), indicated that PMAIP1 mRNA expression
positively correlated with MYCN mRNA expression (Figures 1F,
S1E, and S1F). The positive relationship between PMAIP1
mRNA expression and MYCN mRNA expression was also
observed in a large collection of neuroblastoma cell lines (Garnett
et al., 2012) (Figure S1G) and confirmed in our neuroblastoma cell
line panel (Figure S1H). Altogether, these data indicate high MYCN
expression is associated with high NOXA expression.
High levels of NOXA expression can confer sensitivity to BCL2/BCL-xL inhibitors (Lucas et al., 2012; Nakajima et al., 2014;
Nalluri et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014), and artificial expression
of NOXA is sufficient to sensitize cancer cells to BCL-2/BCL-xL
inhibitors (Nakajima et al., 2014), suggesting that increased
NOXA expression is a contributing factor to ABT-263 sensitivity
observed in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. We therefore
reduced NOXA expression by stably expressing short hairpins
(sh) against NOXA or transfection of siRNA directed against
NOXA, with both experimental methods resulting in reduced
NOXA expression and protection of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines from ABT-263-mediated apoptosis compared
with controls (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B). These data confirm
that reduction of NOXA levels de-sensitizes MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma cells to ABT-263.
The relationship between MYCN and PMAIP1 expression in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells was significant (Figures
1C–1E and S1D, S1G, and S1H), raising the possibility that
MYCN may regulate PMAIP1 in these tumors. We investigated
this hypothesis by knockdown of MYCN and found a concomitant decrease in NOXA protein (Figures 2C and S2C) and
PMAIP1 mRNA levels (Figure S2D). Furthermore, ectopic
MYCN expression in MYCN-WT neuroblastoma cells or in
epithelium-derived RPE-1 cells led to a concomitant increase
in NOXA at both the protein and RNA levels (Figures 2D and
2E). In contrast, reducing MYCN levels in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells or increasing MYCN in MYCN-WT neuroblastoma cells did not consistently affect the expression of other
BCL-2 family proteins other than PMAIP1 (Figures S2E and
S2F), nor did MYCN levels correlate with other BCL-2 family

member expression in the Garnett cell line collection (Figures
S2G–S2I). These data indicate that MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma cells upregulates NOXA expression and contributes to
ABT-263 sensitivity.
We further assessed whether MYCN was causative of ABT263 sensitivity. Upon ABT-263 treatment, the exogenous
MYCN-expressing WT neuroblastoma cells demonstrated a
marked increase in cleaved PARP expression compared with
the GFP-expressing controls; consistently, these cells had
enhanced sensitivity to ABT-263 in 3-day viability assays (Figures 2F and 2G). Conversely, the shMYCN-transduced MYCNamplified neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2) and SK-N-DZ cells were
de-sensitized to ABT-263 compared with the control cells (Figures 2H and 2I). These data further demonstrate a causal role
of MYCN in ABT-263 sensitivity in neuroblastoma. We next
probed whether MYCN-regulation of PMAIP1 was direct. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed preferential binding
of the MYCN antibody over an isotype-matched IgG control
within the promoter of PMAIP1 similar to well-characterized
MYCN-binding sites in MDM2 and MIR17HG (Figure 2J) (Shohet
et al., 2011; Slack et al., 2005). One site, BS1, includes the reported MYCN-preferential CATGTG motif, and BS2 includes
the CAACTG motif that MYCN shows a proclivity toward when
amplified (Murphy et al., 2009). These data altogether demon-

strate that amplified MYCN sensitizes neuroblastoma cells to
ABT-263, and this involves MYCN-dependent upregulation of
PMAIP1 transcription.
MYCN-Amplified Neuroblastoma Cells Retain Sensitivity
to ABT-199
Despite its clinical efficacy in certain hematologic cancers, the
utility of ABT-263 may be hampered by on-target thrombocytopenia (Roberts et al., 2012) that is a result of BCL-xL inhibition in
platelets (Mason et al., 2007). ABT-199 (venetoclax) is a next-generation BH3 mimetic designed to spare BCL-xL (Souers et al.,
2013); however, despite the obvious benefit of this drug in avoiding thrombocytopenia, its utility may largely be dictated by a cancer’s propensity to rely on BCL-2 over BCL-xL for survival.
Toward this end, we performed gene expression analysis of
BCL-2 and BCL-xL in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (Barretina et al., 2012). BCL-2 expression was significantly higher in
neuroblastoma cells compared with other solid tumor cell lines,
and BCL-xL expression was significantly reduced in neuroblastoma cells, resulting in a high BCL-2:BCL-xL ratio (Figure 3A).
We therefore hypothesized that the unique sensitivity to ABT263 seen in MYCN-amplified cells would be preserved following
ABT-199 treatment; in fact, we found that MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells remained sensitive to ABT-199, while MYCN-WT

neuroblastoma cells and RPE-1 cells were insensitive to ABT199, consistent with their insensitivity to ABT-263 (Figures 3B
and S3A). In the other solid tumor cell lines with a range of sensitivity to ABT-263, all lines were resistant to ABT-199 (Figures 3B
and S3A). Similar to the data with ABT-263 (Figure 2F), exogenous
expression of MYCN markedly increased sensitivity to ABT-199 in
MYCN-WT neuroblastoma cells and RPE-1 cells (Figure 3C).
Combination Drug Screen Reveals that Dual BCL-2Aurora A Kinase Inhibition Therapy Is Effective
ABT-199 has exhibited a relatively favorable toxicity profile (Seymour et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2014), and it uniquely induced
apoptosis in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells (Figures 3B

and S3A); we therefore decided to pursue the drug as part of a
combination targeted therapy strategy for MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. We performed a combination drug screen using
ABT-199 as the ‘‘anchor’’ in combination with 24 targeted therapies covering a wide array of targets (Table S2). We found that
both concentrations of the Aurora A inhibitor MLN8237 (alisertib)
and the Aurora A/B inhibitor VX680 (tozasertib) potently induced
apoptosis in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas when combined
with ABT-199 (Figures 4A and 4B). Furthermore, both combinations potently decreased the viability of KELLY cells (Figure 4C),
consistent with the apoptosis screen (Figure 4A); strong
apoptotic responses were also detected when assayed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figure S3B). The Bliss

Program, leading to testing in pediatric
neuroblastoma patients (Maris et al.,
2010), and MLN8237 was more potent at
a lower dose than the dual Aurora inhibitor
VX680 when combined with ABT-199 (Figure 4C), we decided to pursue ABT-199/
MLN8237 combinations in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. MLN8237 is an
in-clinic Aurora A inhibitor with high specificity over Aurora B (Manfredi et al., 2011).
We verified both single-agent efficacy of
the two drugs as well as the apoptosisinducing potency of the combination
across a panel of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells compared with both the
MYCN-WT neuroblastoma cells and the
RPE-1 cell line, where it was ineffective
(Figure 5A, 57.6 ± 8.1 versus 5.8 ± 2.9,

apoptosis seen when MLN8237 was combined with ABT-199
could be due to reduction of MCL-1 levels, effectively decreasing
the apoptotic threshold even lower in these cancers. Therefore,
we assessed MCL-1 expression following MLN8237 treatment.
We found that MCL-1 expression was downregulated following
MLN8237 treatment (Figure 5B and S4C). Interestingly, we found
levels of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 were also reduced by
MLN8237, following the same pattern as MCL-1 expression
and phosphorylated Aurora A (Figures 5B and S4C). MCL-1
mRNA levels were elevated following treatment with MLN8237
(Figure S4D), which may be a result of feedback from protein
loss (Faber et al., 2014). Furthermore, phosphorylated GSK3,
corresponding to inactivation of the kinase, which stabilizes
MCL-1 in a mitosis-independent matter (Maurer et al., 2006),
was not inhibited by MLN8237, and in fact, was often upregulated (Figure S4E).
Inhibiting p4E-BP1 in other cancers leads to disruption of the
eIF4G:eIF4E complex and downregulation of cap-dependent
MCL-1 protein translation (Mallya et al., 2014; Mills et al., 2008;
Schatz et al., 2011), which suggested that MLN8237 reduced
MCL-1 expression in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells via
a shift toward mitotic arrest-inducing degradation and away
from cap-dependent MCL-1 translation. Therefore, we sought
to determine whether inhibition of mTORC1-p4E-BP1 leads to
downregulation of MCL-1 in these cancers (Faber et al., 2014;
Schatz et al., 2011). In fact, we found that treatment with the
TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 led to downregulation of p-4EBP1 and MCL-1 in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas (Figure S5A), which demonstrated that MCL-1 in these cancers is
downregulated following inhibition of p4E-BP1. We verified
that MLN8237 and VX680 treatment each resulted in loss of
p4E-BP1 and MCL-1 in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells
(Figure S5B), as did knockdown of Aurora A (Figure S5C). These
data altogether confirm a role of Aurora A in the downregulation
of p4E-BP1, which results in the downregulation of MCL-1 in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. We next treated MYCNamplified neuroblastoma cells with a short time course of
MLN8237, and found p4E-BP1 and MCL-1 were reduced prior
to marked mitotic arrest (Figures S5D and S5E), suggesting a
contribution of MCL-1 downregulation independent of mitotic arrest. To more directly address whether inhibition of protein translation contributes to MCL-1 downregulation following MLN8237
treatment, we first measured the effects of MLN8237 on global
protein translation in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells
(Goodman et al., 2011). We demonstrate a consistent decrease
in protein translation across the cells (Figure S5F). To specifically
determine whether inhibition of cap-dependent translation was
contributing to the decrease in global protein synthesis, we performed a pull-down assay with m7-GTP Sepharose beads to
determine whether the levels of cap-bound proteins were
decreased. Western blot analysis revealed disassociation of
eIF4G:eIF4E, significant for inhibition of cap-dependent protein
translation (Figure S5G), with the expected concomitant increase in 4EBP1:eIF4E complexes (Figure S5G). Therefore, in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, MLN8237 inhibits p4E-BP1,
leading to loss of eIF4G:eIF4E complex-mediated MCL-1 protein
translation.
We next sought to better define the role of MCL-1 in combination-induced toxicity. MCL-1 reduction by siRNA sensitized

MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells to ABT-199, inducing
similar levels of apoptosis as the combination treatment in
the scrambled (sc) siRNA transfected cells (Figures 5C and
S6B). Introducing exogenous MCL-1 inhibited apoptosis, as
measured by cleaved PARP induced by combined ABT-199/
MLN8237 (Figures 5D and S6A). The induction of apoptosis in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells was mitigated by BIM
siRNA (Figures 5C and S6C), implicating that the disruption of
BIM/MCL-1 complexes leads to loss of MCL-1-bound BIM
and contributes to ABT-199/MLN8237-mediated apoptosis.
To directly assess this, we performed immunoprecipitation
with antibodies against MCL-1 and BIM in SK-N-BE(2) and
SK-N-DZ cell lysates following different drug treatments. We
found that BIM:MCL-1 complexes are increased following
ABT-199 treatment, which mitigates BIM-mediated apoptosis;
however, addition of MLN8237 markedly reduced these complexes, consistent with the effect of MLN8237 on MCL-1
expression in whole-cell extracts (Figures 5E and S6D). These
data altogether demonstrate that MLN8237 downregulation of
MCL-1 contributes to the sensitivity of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells to ABT-199/MLN8237 by disrupting BIM:MCL-1
complexes and that ABT-199/MLN8237 combination-induced
apoptosis is, at least in part, mediated by BIM. Of interest,
we found that MYCN protein levels were also reduced by
MLN8237 treatment (Figure 5B), consistent with previous data
(Brockmann et al., 2013) and likely contributing to combination
efficacy.
Differential Apoptosis Induced by ABT-199/MLN8237 in
MYCN-Amplified Compared with MYCN-WT
Neuroblastoma Cells Translates to Potent Differences
in Drug Efficacy
To characterize the relevance of the differential apoptotic
response seen in the combined ABT-199/MLN8237 treatment
between MYCN-amplified and MYCN-WT neuroblastoma cells
(Figure 5A), we treated cell lines with each inhibitor alone or
in combination and assayed viability after 5 days (Figures 5F
and 5G). After 5 days of treatment, cells treated with the combination demonstrated marked growth inhibition in the MYCNamplified neuroblastoma cells compared with MYCN-WT cells;
the single agents had limited and variable effects across the
MYCN-amplified cell lines (Figure 5F). Consistent with the
apoptosis data (Figure 5A), the combination had a limited effect
on MYCN-WT neuroblastoma cells and the RPE-1 cell line (Figure 5G). Similarly, in 6-day viability assays, when cells were
treated with increasing doses of MLN8237, the combination
of ABT-199 and MLN8237 was markedly more effective in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells compared with the
MYCN-WT neuroblastoma cells and the RPE-1 cell line (Figures
S6E and S6F). It is noteworthy that similar levels of efficacy
were demonstrated with the ABT-199/MLN8237 combination
as the ABT-263/MLN8237 combination in the MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma cells (Figures S6E and S6F). These data are
consistent with the expression data supporting the use of the
Bcl-xL-sparing ABT-199 in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma
(Figure 3A) and the ability of ABT-199 to induce apoptosis in
these cancers (Figure 3B). Lastly, we noted that this combination was effective at even low concentrations of MLN8237
(10 nM MLN8237) in the MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells

(Figures 4C, 5F, and S6E). Together, these data show a specific
and potent in vitro efficacy of ABT-199/MLN8237 in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells, even at relatively low concentrations of MLN8237.
ABT-199/MLN8237 Exhibits Robust In Vivo Activity
against MYCN-Amplified Neuroblastoma
Based on the in vitro specificity and potency of this combination,
we pursued studies in animal models of neuroblastoma. MYCNamplified KELLY and SK-N-BE(2) xenograft-bearing mice were
treated with 30 mg/kg once daily MLN8237, 100 mg/kg once daily
ABT-199, or the combination, and tumor progression was monitored. There was no reduction in mouse body weight (Figure S7A).
Neither MLN8237 nor ABT-199 alone regressed these tumors,
whereas mice treated with the combination exhibited tumor
regression (Figure 6A). KELLY xenografts in mice treated with
the combination regressed to an undetectable level and remained undetectable for 60 days following the last treatment.

Based on previous criteria (Laude et al.,
1991), we considered this a durable and
lasting tumor-free response (Figure 6A).
Analysis of tumors treated with MLN8237
and ABT-199 showed that the combination
reduced the levels of MCL-1 and p4E-BP1
in vivo, consistent with our in vitro observations (Figure 6B). In contrast, the MYCN-WT
SK-N-SH mouse xenograft model was
insensitive, and in fact tumors treated with
ABT-199 appeared to grow faster than the
no-treatment controls (Figure 6C). Again,
the combination therapy was well tolerated
by evidence of weight sustainability (Figure S7B). In vitro modeling of sensitivity to the combination
revealed MYCN expression was sufficient to sensitize to the combination (Figure 6D), consistent with our data from the singleagent BCL-2 inhibitors (Figures 2F, 2G, 3C).
MLN8237 has been tested in a phase I clinical trial conducted
within the Children’s Oncology Group (Mosse et al., 2012), which
revealed an optimal dosing schedule of 80 mg/m2 daily for
7 days, followed by 14 days off treatment, repeated every
3 weeks. Therefore, we performed additional in vivo experiments
at the clinically relevant dosing schedule (Mosse et al., 2012). In
the MYCN-amplified human xenograft mouse model of NB1643, ABT-199 was administered daily at 100 mg/kg, and
MLN8237 was administered at 30 mg/kg, 7 days on, 14 days
off. Following this dosing schedule, the NB-1643 model displayed tumor stasis with single-agent MLN8237 treatment, significant tumor regression with single-agent ABT-199 treatment,
and complete regression of all tumors with the combination (Figure 7A); these mice were followed for an additional 60 days

following completion of treatment, during which the tumors remained undetectable (Figure 7B).
The implementation of patient-derived cell lines and patientderived xenografts (PDXs) in preclinical studies has been helpful
to evaluate and improve cancer therapeutics (Crystal et al., 2014;
Faber et al., 2015). Here, we have established MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma PDXs via injection of fresh tumor from a neuroblastoma patient into CB17 SCID mice for preclinical evaluation
of this combination therapy. Following the same dosing schedule
for MLN8237 of 1 week on, 2 weeks off, mice treated with
100 mg/kg once daily ABT-199, 30 mg/kg MLN8237, or the combination, were evaluated. While both single agents had modest
activity in this model, the combination induced regression of
ten out of ten tumors in the cohort (Figure 7C). In these PDXs,
there was a notable increase in MCL-1 expression following
ABT-199 treatment, and MLN8237 led to reduction in MCL-1
from both baseline levels and levels following ABT-199 treatment
(Figure 7D), similar to the in vitro results (Figure 5B) and the
KELLY tumors (Figure 6B). The combination-treated mice
showed no reduction in weight gain during the treatment period
(Figure S7C), consistent with the mice from the Nu/Nu mouse
studies (Figures S7A and S7B). These data suggest that the combination therapy can induce sustained remissions in a PDX model
harboring MYCN amplification using a clinically feasible schedule
of MLN8237 and ABT-199 administration, supporting its promising preclinical profile and proposed mode of action (Figure 8).

antisense oligonucleotides results in tumor growth inhibition (Burkhart et al.,
2003). As a non-kinase, however, drugging MYCN with small molecule inhibitors
has proven challenging. Recently, several
groups reported that indirectly targeting
MYCN resulted in anti-tumor activity,
further validating the pathway as an
important target (Chipumuro et al., 2014; Gustafson et al.,
2014; Puissant et al., 2013). One such approach used
MLN8237, which induces proteasome-mediated degradation
of MYCN (Brockmann et al., 2013) and leads to loss of its expression (Brockmann et al., 2013).
In this study, we took a pharmacogenomic approach to
identify an effective combination-based targeted therapy for
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. This approach yielded several
important findings. First, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells
are exquisitely sensitive to the BCL-2/BCL-xL inhibitor ABT263. MYCN directly regulates the expression of NOXA in these
cancers, with amplified MYCN leading to high expression of
NOXA. Second, due to high BCL-2/BCL-xL ratios in these cancers, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells retain sensitivity to
the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199. Third, the Aurora Kinase A inhibitor
MLN8237 enhances efficacy of ABT-199 in part by inducing
mitotic arrest and downregulating MCL-1, disrupting ABT-199
induced BIM:MCL-1 complexes. Fourth, in multiple mouse
models of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, complete and sustained regressions were noted, without any overt signs of toxicity
to the mice.
MYCN is a promiscuous transcription factor that prefers
CATGTG and CACGTG E-BOX sites; moreover, amplified
MYCN binds additional E-BOX sites, including a propensity towards CAACTG (Murphy et al., 2009). Here, we found that
MYCN bound two regions in the PMAIP1 promoter, encompassing a CATGTG E Box and a CAACTG E Box.
MYCN-induced upregulation of NOXA in neuroblastoma
models adds to the list of other MYCN-regulated pro-apoptotic
processes in this disease (Chen et al., 2010; Fulda et al., 1999;
Petroni et al., 2011; Veschi et al., 2012). Debatin and colleagues

have low BCL-xL levels. The addition of ABT-199
inhibits BCL-2 with further reduction of MCL-1 by
MLN8237, leading to the liberation of BIM and
apoptosis. Modified from Faber et al. (2014).

demonstrated that while overexpression of MYCN in neuroblastoma does not induce apoptosis, it primes the cell for cytotoxic
drugs to induce apoptosis through cooperative upregulation of
BAX (Fulda et al., 1999). Therefore, it is likely that MYCN-driven
anti-apoptotic signals are particularly critical for tumorigenesis
in neuroblastoma in order to counter these pro-apoptotic signals
(Hogarty, 2003). For instance, caspase 8 is often silenced in neuroblastoma, and in TH-MYCN mice, which express MYCN in
neural crest cells that form neuroblastomas; caspase 8 deficiencies cause formation of metastatic neuroblastomas in the
bone marrow (Teitz et al., 2013). Consistent with a role of amplified MYCN in BCL-2 family-mediated apoptosis following
cellular stress, BCL-2 overexpression from serum deprivation
and metabolic stress can counter MYCN-mediated apoptotic
signaling in neuroblastoma and, therefore, cooperate in tumorigenicity (Jasty et al., 2001; Ushmorov et al., 2008). In addition,
MYCN amplification participates in killing of neuroblastoma cells
following glutamine deprivation, and this pathway involves
NOXA (Qing et al., 2012).
In our therapeutic approach, ABT-199 eliminates this pro-survival BCL-2 signal, thus allowing for MYCN-mediated proapoptotic signaling to help push the neuroblastoma cells toward
the apoptotic threshold. MLN8237 further pushes the neuroblastoma cell past the apoptotic threshold through reduction of
MCL-1; BCL-xL is ineffective at blocking the ensuing death
signal because BCL-xL levels are markedly low. The benefit of
MYCN reduction by MLN8237 outweighs any relief of a proapoptotic signal, consistent with the anti-cancerous effects of
targeting MYCN alone in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.
Altogether, the combination therapy reduces cell viability and induces widespread apoptosis in vitro, with in vivo tumor regressions demonstrated in preclinical models. Finally, since drug
treatments were well tolerated in multiple mouse strains, the
combination therapy appears to have a favorable toxicity profile.
Prolonged mitotic arrest leads to loss of MCL-1 (Harley et al.,
2010; Haschka et al., 2015), as does downregulation of p-4EBP1, which mediates eIF4 complex formation and subsequent
cap-dependent translation (Faber et al., 2014, 2015; Hsieh
et al., 2010; Mallya et al., 2014; Mills et al., 2008; Schatz et al.,
2011). Here, we have demonstrated that Aurora A inhibition not
only leads to mitotic arrest but also leads to loss of p4E-BP1 in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells (resulting in downregulation of MCL-1 as a result of cap-dependent translation inhibition).
Therefore, it is likely that both mitotic arrest and loss of p4E-BP1mediated cap-dependent protein translation contribute to the
loss of MCL-1 following MLN8237 treatment in MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma cells.

To substantiate our in vitro and in vivo human xenograft findings, we found that the combination is effective in a MYCNamplified neuroblastoma PDX model, which demonstrated only
modest single-agent MLN8237 activity, mirroring clinical activity
of MLN8237 in neuroblastoma (Mosse et al., 2012). Altogether,
this combination should be prioritized for clinical testing in patients with the MYCN-amplified subset of neuroblastoma.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Drug Screen
The drug screen in which the ABT-263 sensitivity data was obtained (Figures
1A and 1B) comparing neuroblastoma sensitivity with other solid tumor cell
lines has been described previously (Garnett et al., 2012).
Targeted Therapy Anchor Screen
SK-N-DZ and KELLY cells were plated at 2,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in
RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with
either 1 mM ABT-199, 50 mM Z-FAD-FMK caspase inhibitor, 1 mM ABT-199
and 70 nM test drug, or 1 mM ABT-199 and 700 nM test drug. After 24 hr, caspase-3/7 levels were determined using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, plates were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature and an equal volume of Caspase-Glo 3/7 Reagent
was added to each well. Plates were mixed at 500 rpm for 30 s, incubated at
room temperature, and luminescence read after 30 min.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
Chromatin from 25 3 106 KELLY and SK-N-DZ cells were purified and
sheared on a Diagenode Bioruptor. Cycle thresholds reached from SYBR green
incorporation were calculated from 5 ng of chromatin per qPCR reaction.
Primers were BS1, 5-tgctgggattacagacgtga-30 (forward), gagttcgagaccagcct
gac (reverse), originally described in Nikiforov et al. (2007); BS2, 5-caggttca
agcgattctcgt-30 (forward), ataccagccttgccaatatg-3 (reverse); MDM2, 5-agcc
tttgtgcggttcgtg-30 (forward), 5-ccccgtgacctttaccctg-30 (reverse); MIR17HG,
5-tctcccgagggcgagagttaaagc-30 (forward), 5-caccctcgcgcgtacaaagtttgg-30
(reverse).
Xenograft Studies
Nu/Nu mice were injected with 5 3 106 cells/100 ml of PBS, in combination
with 100 ml of Matrigel. Mice were injected subcutaneously and monitored
for tumor growth. When tumors reached 200–400 mm3, the tumor-bearingmice were randomized to a no-treatment control group, a MLN8237 group
(30 mg/kg), an ABT-199 group (100 mg/kg), or a combination group (same
doses). Mice in the treatment cohorts (n = 3–6) were subsequently treated
with drugs directly to the stomach by oral gavage. The solvent for MLN8237
was 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin and 1% Na butyrate. The solvent
for ABT-199 was 60% Phosal, 30% PEG 400, 10% EtOH. During the study, tumors were routinely measured by electronic caliper two to three times a week,
in two dimensions (length and width), and with the formula v = l 3 (w)2(p/6),
where v is the tumor volume, l is the length, and w is the width. The drug schedules were once daily for the different xenograft models except NB-1643, which
was once daily for MLN8237 for 1 week, with 2 weeks off MLN8237, and
MLN8237 treatment resuming on week 4. For pharmacodynamic studies,

tumor-bearing mice were treated for 3 days, tumors were harvested 2–3 hr
following the last treatment, and tumors were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
All these mouse experiments were approved and performed in accordance
with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Massachusetts
General Hospital.

Patient-Derived Xenografts
The PDX tumor tissue was obtained through the Children’s Oncology Group
Cell Culture and Xenograft Repository. CB17 SCID mice were subcutaneously
implanted with MYCN-amplified COG-N-471x PDX tumors and monitored for
tumor growth. Once the tumors reached a median tumor volume of 230–
240 mm3, PDX-bearing mice were randomized into statistically identical cohorts (10 mice/group) and treated continuously with 100 mg/kg once daily of
ABT-199; 30 mg/kg once daily of MLN8237 for 1 week, followed by 2 weeks
without treatment and the cycle resumed on week 4; the combination of
ABT-199 100 mg/kg once daily being given continuously with the MLN8237
30 mg/kg once daily dosed for 1 week with 2 weeks break; appropriate vehicle
control of 60% Phosal50, 30% PEG400, 10% EtOH as ABT-199 vehicle and
10% hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin, 1% Na butyrate as vehicle for MLN8237
by oral gavage in 100 ml/10 g of body weight. Tumor size was measured by
caliper every 3–4 days, and volume was calculated by the spheroid formula:
(p/6) 3 d3, where d represents the mean diameter. The work on the PDX is
considered non-human subjects research. All animal experiments were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. The PDX
study in CB17 SCID mice was approved by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol # IAC-15000643).

Database Analyses
All the gene expression datasets (besides the cancer cell line encyclopedia) in
this study were from Oncomine (www.oncomine.org) and were downloaded
and analyzed using Oncomine premium research edition. The gene expression
data in Oncomine is Log2 transformed and median-centered as in Figures 1C–
1F, Figures S1A–S1G and Figures S2G–S2I.

Statistical Considerations
IC50 values for cell lines as presented in Figures 1A and 1B were calculated as
previously described in the drug screens (Garnett et al., 2012). Non-parametric
Mann-Whitney U-tests were performed for Figures 1D and 1E and Figures
S1A–S1C. The statistical determinations from Table S1 are described in detail
(Yang et al., 2013). Student’s t test (two-sided) and linear regression analysis
were performed using GraphPad Prism. Differences were considered statistically different if p < 0.05.
