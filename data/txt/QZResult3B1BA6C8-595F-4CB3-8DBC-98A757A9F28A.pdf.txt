INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Development of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a prevalent and challenging
problem in managing cancer patients (Holohan et al., 2013). The high morbidity and
mortality associated with many types of human cancer is attributed to the emergence of
tumor cells that are refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy and clonally develop into recurrent
tumors. Although The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and several other genome-wide
studies have revealed the molecular landscapes of cancer, these studies mainly focus on
primary tumors (Vogelstein et al., 2013). It is critical, however, to study recurrent tumors and
elucidate the molecular etiology of drug resistance. Toward this goal, we previously studied
ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) to identify genes and the pathways they
controlled in the development of recurrent diseases. HGSC is the most common and lethal
type of ovarian cancer (Cho and Shih, 2009); most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages
and require the first-line therapy, which involves cytoreductive surgery followed by
combined carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. While patients generally respond to this
standard chemotherapy at the beginning of their course, many experience relapse and require
further therapy including the weekly paclitaxel regimen. Unfortunately, only a small
percentage (10–15%) of patients with advanced disease achieve long-term remission.
In a previous study, we compared proteomes between primary and recurrent postchemotherapy HGSC tissues from the same patients (Jinawath et al., 2010). Among the
preferentially expressed proteins identified in recurrent HGSCs, the non-receptor tyrosine
kinase, Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (SYK), was of interest because more than half of the
recurrent tumors expressed higher levels of SYK than did the primary tumors (Jinawath et
al., 2010). This is significant because small molecule inhibitors that target SYK, such as

fostamatinib (R788), are available for pre-clinical testing and for future clinical trials in
ovarian cancer patients (Ruzza et al., 2009).

Author Manuscript

Originally isolated from bovine thymus (Zioncheck et al., 1986) and later identified in
activated B lymphocytes (Hutchcroft et al., 1991; Zioncheck et al., 1988), SYK regulates
adaptive immune receptor signaling, cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. SYK has
been reported as a candidate oncogene in B-cell leukemia and lymphomas, gastric
carcinoma, and head and neck cancer (Buchner et al., 2009; Feldman et al., 2008;
Luangdilok et al., 2007; Mocsai et al., 2010; Nakashima et al., 2006). SYK expression has
an anti-apoptotic effect on B-lymphoma cell lines through phosphorylation of nucleolin
which stabilizes the mRNA of antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L) (Wang et al., 2014). Paradoxically,
SYK expression may block tumor progression in breast cancer as loss of its expression is
associated with poor prognosis and tumor metastasis (Coopman et al., 2000). The evidence
thus suggests that SYK can either negatively or positively regulate tumor progression,
depending on the biological context and tissue lineage (Geahlen, 2014).
The purpose of this study is to determine how SYK contributes to chemoresistance in
ovarian cancers and establish a biological foundation for introducing SYK inhibitors to
potentiate the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. We also seek to identify
candidate SYK substrates involved in drug resistance and the results should have
translational implications to improve chemotherapy and clinical outcome in cancer patients.

RESULTS
Recurrent ovarian tumors express higher levels of SYK and phosphorylated SYK

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To compare the expression levels of SYK in paired recurrent post-chemotherapy ovarian
HGSC and their primary untreated tumors, we performed immunohistochemistry using two
antibodies, one specific for SYK and the other specific for its active (autophosphorylated)
form, p-SYK (Y525/526). Using the H-score to semi-quantify immunoreactivity, we found
that H-scores for SYK were higher in the recurrent ovarian HGSC specimens than in the
primary counterparts (Figure 1A), and H-scores for active p-SYK (Y525/526) were higher in
recurrent tumors than in primary tumors (Figure 1B). Likewise, H-scores of total SYK or pSYK positively correlated to each other (Figure 1C). Representative staining for p-SYK in a
pair of matched primary and recurrent ovarian HGSC is shown in Figure 1D. Aside from
HGSC, upregulated SYK expression was also observed in 4 out of 6 cases of recurrent postchemotherapy ovarian clear cell carcinomas as compared to matched primary tumors (Figure
S1A). We further examined SYK expression using immunohistochemistry in 214 serous
ovarian carcinoma effusions (Table S1; see supplementary experimental procedures for the
cohort information) and observed an association (p= 0.005) between higher SYK staining
intensity and less favorable chemoresponse to paclitaxel/platinum-based combination
therapy. These data support that SYK upregulation is associated with chemoresistance.
Association between paclitaxel resistance and SYK
Since the recurrent HGSC tissues were obtained from patients who were previously treated
with carboplatin and paclitaxel combination therapy, we sought to determine if SYK

overexpression was related to resistance of carboplatin or paclitaxel. We analyzed two
ovarian cancer cell lines, SKOV3 and MPSC1, from which carboplatin resistant and
paclitaxel resistant (TR) clones were previously established (Jinawath et al., 2010; Jinawath
et al., 2009). We found that paclitaxel resistant SKOV3TR and MPSC1TR expressed higher
levels of SYK and p-SYK (Y525/526) than the parental cells (Figure 1E and 1F), suggesting
that SYK upregulation was related to biological resistance to paclitaxel, and is not due to
acute induction by paclitaxel in naive cells (Figure S1B).

Author Manuscript

To examine if there is an association between SYK activity and response to paclitaxel, we
analyzed a panel of 25 primary ovarian cancer cell cultures and cell lines expressing
different levels of SYK by immunoblotting (Figure S1C). The degree of paclitaxel
sensitivity in these cells was determined by their IC50 values. A significant positive
correlation was observed between p-SYK/SYK ratios and the IC50 of paclitaxel but not
carboplatin (Figure 1G), suggesting that active SYK is an important determinant of
paclitaxel resistance.
Inactivation of SYK suppresses cell growth in ovarian cancer cells

Author Manuscript

To determine if SYK can be a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer, we inactivated SYK using
shRNAs or small molecule inhibitors. We found that SYK knockdown, as compared to
control knockdown, significantly reduced cell numbers in naive (parental) SKOV3 and
MPSC1 as well as in their corresponding paclitaxel resistant clones, although the SYK
knockdown achieved in resistant cells were not as pronounced as the naive (Figure 2A).
Next, we treated SKOV3 cells with the SYK inhibitor R406 (the active metabolite of
fostamatinib) and observed that R406 suppressed SYK autophosphorylation at Y525/526
and Y352, which was considered as an indicator for SYK activation (Figure 2B) and resulted
in concentration dependent inhibition of SYK activity as measured by reduction of p-SYK
(Y525/526) (Figure S2A). We further observed that R406 inhibited proliferation in a dosedependent manner in SKOV3, SKOV3TR, MPSC1 and MPSC1TR cells (Figure 2C).

Author Manuscript

Next, we determined the sensitivity to R406 in a panel of cell lines with various levels of
endogenous SYK expression (Figure 2D). Based on Western blot analysis, we separated cell
lines into SYK expressing and undetectable groups, and observed significantly greater
sensitivity to R406 (lower IC50 values) in SYK expressing cell lines than in cell lines with
undetectable levels of SYK expression (Figure 2E). Calculation of Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient demonstrated a negative correlation between SYK expression and the
IC50 values for R406 (Figure 2F). Similarly, an inverse correlation between pSYK
(Y525/526) expression levels and the IC50 values of R406 was observed in these cell lines
(Figure S2B).
SYK inhibitors enhance paclitaxel sensitivity
We then tested the effect of combining R406 with chemotherapeutic agents including
paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, mitomycin C and
methotrexate. Based on the drug combination index, we found that microtubule targeting
agents including paclitaxel and docetaxel had a synergistic effect with R406, whereas other
drugs including carboplatin produced no such effect (Figure 3A and Figure S3A). The

ability of SYK inhibitor to enhance paclitaxel cytotoxicity was dose dependent, as higher
R406 concentrations were associated with a greater inhibitory effect (Figure 3B).
Enhancement of paclitaxel sensitivity was also observed by SYK knockdown using shRNAs
(Figure S3B and C) and siRNAs (Figure S3D and E). In other primary ovarian tumor cell
cultures and ovarian cancer cell lines that exhibited high intrinsic resistance to paclitaxel
(IC50 ≥ 5nM), combination of paclitaxel and SYK inhibitors were also synergistic (Figure
3D, Figure S3F). The use of other SYK inhibitors including P505-15/PRT062607 and
GS-9973 (Figure 3C) (Currie et al., 2014; Hoellenriegel et al., 2012) produced a similar
result. In cell lines with high levels of SYK, including OVCAR3 and OVCA429, such
synergistic effect was also observed (Figure S3F). These data suggest that the effect
observed from R406 was unlikely due to non-specific pan-kinase inhibition.

Author Manuscript

The effect of R406 on paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity was further compared between
paclitaxel-resistant and naive cells. We found that treatment with SYK inhibitors resulted in
a prominent shift of the paclitaxel IC50s in both SKOV3TR and MPSC1TR cells compared
to parental SKOV3 and MPSC1 cells. Specifically, the ratio of paclitaxel IC50 in untreated to
R406 treated SKOV3 cells was 2.5 while in SKOV3TR it was 236 (Figure 3E). The ratio of
paclitaxel IC50 for MPSC1 cells in untreated cells to R406 treated cells was 8 while in
MPSC1TR it was 12,429 (Figure 3F), suggesting that paclitaxel resistant cells were much
more sensitive to the combined SYK inhibitor and paclitaxel treatment than their parental
counterparts. The other SYK inhibitors also showed synergistic relationship with paclitaxel
in the resistant SKOV3TR and MPSC1TR cells (Figure S3F).
Combination of R406 and paclitaxel induces G2/M arrest and enhances apoptosis

Author Manuscript

Since paclitaxel targets microtubules, the above results suggested that SYK may also
regulate microtubule function which is essential for mitosis. Therefore, we quantified cell
cycle distribution in cells treated with R406, paclitaxel, or their combination. It is known
that paclitaxel induces microtubule stabilization and leads to mitotic block in the late G2/Mphase of the cell cycle. Based on high-throughput imaging analysis of in vitro cell cultures
using Hoechst 33342 staining of DNA, we were able to confirm that paclitaxel increased the
fraction of SKOV3 cells at the G2/M phase 8 hr, 12 hr, or 16 hr after treatment (Figure S3G–
H). In contrast, SKOV3TR cells did not respond to paclitaxel treatment alone, but arrested in
G2/M phase only when the cells were co-treated with R406. In addition, the levels of
apoptosis markers, cleaved PARP and caspase 7 (Figure S3I) and annexin V staining (Figure
S3J), increased when cells were co-treated with R406 and paclitaxel compared to the cells
treated with vehicle control, R406, or paclitaxel only.

Combination of R406 and paclitaxel inhibits tumor growth in naive and paclitaxel resistant
ovarian tumor xenograft
Two mouse models were used to assess the anti-tumor effect of R406, paclitaxel, and their
combination. In the first model, SKOV3c.2 cell line was used because this subclone of
SKOV3 was tumorigenic subcutaneously and expressed a relatively higher level of SYK
(Figure 2D). Athymic mice bearing the SKOV3c.2 subcutaneous tumors were treated with
paclitaxel (8 mg/kg), R406 (6.5 mg/kg), or their combination. Drugs were administered over
several three-days on/three-days off cycles initiated when the tumors first became palpable

(Figure S4A). We intended to use a low dose of paclitaxel and R406 in order to determine
the combinational anti-tumor effect and minimize adverse effects. At the given doses, there
was no significant difference in tumor weight between the control group and the groups
treated with either single R406 or paclitaxel after 4 cycles of treatment (Figure 4A–C).
However, a significant reduction in tumor weight was recorded in the group co-treated with
R406 and paclitaxel compared to the control group (p<0.0004). The percentage of tumor
cells that incorporated BrdU was significantly lower in tumors receiving the combined R406
and paclitaxel than in other groups (p=0.01) (Figure 4B). R406 treated tumors in mice
showed a reduction of the pSYK (Y525/526)/SYK ratio (Figure S4B). No significant
differences were detected between groups treated with R406 alone and paclitaxel alone.
Body weight, physical activity, and splenic weight of mice in these groups were similar
(Figure S4C, S4D).

Next, we determined if paclitaxel and R406 combination was effective in suppressing
intraperitoneal tumor growth in an in vivo paclitaxel resistant ovarian cancer model. We
established intraperitoneal SKOV3Luc tumors in mice that recurred after continuous
paclitaxel treatment for seven weeks (Figure 4D). Comparing to tumors grown in mice
treated with vehicle, tumors recurred in mice treated with paclitaxel showed higher levels of
p-SYK (Y525/526) and SYK (Figure S4E). In primary cultures, cells from recurred
paclitaxel-treated tumor were more resistant to paclitaxel than cells from vehicle treated
tumors (Figure 4D). The cells from the paclitaxel resistant tumor (paclitaxel-1) were then reinjected intraperitoneally in a new cohort of mice followed by treatment with either vehicle,
R406, paclitaxel or the combination. The new xenografts responded to paclitaxel initially,
but regrew after week 3. Paclitaxel and R406 combination significantly reduced tumor
progression in this model as compared to the paclitaxel alone at week 4 and 5. R406 alone at
the applied dose did not show any anti-tumor effect as compared to vehicle control (Figure
4E–F). Similar to a previous report (Braselmann et al., 2006), we did not detect gross or
microscopic abnormalities in organs from these R406-treated mice. The above results
indicate that the combination of paclitaxel and R406 effectively inhibited tumor growth at
doses that were highly tolerable in mice.
Identification of substrates phosphorylated by SYK in paclitaxel-resistant tumor cells

Author Manuscript

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which SYK inhibition enhanced cytotoxic effects
of paclitaxel, we performed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)
(Ong et al., 2002) and compare the phosphoproteome between SKOV3TR cells treated with
R406 and vehicle control. Based on two independent experiments, we identified a total of
896 unique, differentially expressed phosphopeptides corresponding to 516 proteins (Table
S2), more than 90% of which belonged to phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. As we were
interested in those proteins that were potentially phosphorylated by SYK, we focused on the
phosphorylation sites that were downregulated (average H/L ratio <0.7) by R406 in
duplicate experiments. As a result, there was a total of 327 downregulated phosphopeptides
belonging to 228 proteins. Among them, 141 peptides contained at least one acidic residue
surrounding the phosphorylated Tyr, and were, therefore, considered potential substrates for
SYK (Xue et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2012). Several SYK substrates identified in this study,
including SYKitself and PLCG1, LCK, STAT3, and α-tubulin, have been previously

reported to be SYK substrates in hematopoietic cells (Couture et al., 1996; Law et al., 1996;
Peters et al., 1996; Uckun et al., 2010b). This finding indicated the robustness of our
approach in identifying SYK substrates in ovarian cancer cells.
Pathway analysis indicated that the identified SYK substrates participate in cell motility and
organization of cytoskeleton in addition to proliferation/growth, cell death, and survival
among other processes (Figure 5A–C). Specifically, we identified 19 phosphosites (Table 1)
in the following proteins: dynactin 2 (DCTN2), microtubule associated protein 1B
(MAP1B), microtubule associated protein 4 (MAP4), tubulin binding co-factor B (TBCB),
α-tubulin, and β-tubulin, all of which are proteins essential for microtubule dynamics. Table
S3 lists phosphopeptides we identified that were also reported in B-lymphocytes and breast
cancer cells in a recent study that used an independent method (Xue et al., 2012).

We selected representative SYK substrates including α-tubulin, β-tubulin, MAP4, and
MAP1B for further validation because these proteins are constituents of the microtubules,
and their posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation may have a direct impact on
microtubule stability. Consistent with a previous report (Faruki et al., 2000), we were able to
demonstrate phosphorylation of tubulin by SYK. Importantly, our data from in vitro kinase
assay using active recombinant SYK and purified bovine microtubule associated protein
(MAPs) demonstrated that MAP1B and MAP4 were substrates of SYK (Figure 5D).
Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that SYK inhibitors (R406 and
GS-9973) reduced the levels of Tyr-phosphorylated α- and β-tubulin, although the effect of
P505-15 was modest. The induction of MAP4 and MAP1B Tyr phosphorylation by the Tyr
phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, which is known to activate SYK signaling (Faruki et al.,
2000), was suppressed by SYK inhibitors (Figure S5A). SYK knockdown by siRNA
demonstrated a similar result (Figure S5B). Collectively, these data show that tubulin and
MAPs are direct SYK substrates.

Author Manuscript

Next, we compared the expression of total and Tyr-phosphorylated α- and β-tubulin, MAP4,
and MAP1B between paclitaxel sensitive (SKOV3 and MPSC1) and paclitaxel resistant cells
(SKOV3TR and MPSC1TR) cells. Consistent with an elevated SYK level in paclitaxel
resistant cells, Tyr-phosphorylated α-tubulin (Figure 5E) but not Tyr-phosphorylated βtubulin was upregulated in these resistant cells (Figure S5C). Similarly, total MAP1B and its
Tyr-phosphorylated form were also upregulated in the paclitaxel resistant cells (Figure 5E).
In a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines, higher expression levels of p-Tyr-MAP1B/MAP1B
were associated with less sensitivity to paclitaxel (Figures 5F and S5D), further suggesting
the involvement of MAP1B tyrosine phosphorylation in paclitaxel resistance. Using
immunohistochemistry with the antibody against phospho-α-tubulin (Y272) in 161 HGSC
samples, we observed a positive correlation in staining intensity between total SYK and
phospho-tubulin, and between phospho-SYK and phospho-α tubulin (Figure 5G). Two
representative cases with high and low staining intensity of SYK, phospho-SYK, and
phospho-α tubulin are shown in Figure 5H.

Expression of active SYK confers paclitaxel resistance and increases MAP1B and MAP4
tyrosine phosphorylation
To demonstrate whether activating the SYK pathway is sufficient to confer paclitaxel
resistance, we generated tetracycline inducible SKOV3 cells to ectopically express wild-type
or active SYK mutant (SYK-130E), which has been shown to have a high basal kinase
activity (Keshvara et al., 1997). Paclitaxel IC50 significantly increased in ovarian cancer
cells after induction of SYK-130E, and to a lesser extent of SYK (Figure 6A and 6B),
indicating that SYK activation is sufficient to render paclitaxel resistance. Moreover, cells
expressing constitutively active SYK-130E demonstrated increased Tyr-phosphorylated
MAP1B and MAP4, but not tubulin (Figure 6C). Using an in vitro microtubule binding
assay, we observed that SYK phosphorylated MAP1B and MAP4 could still bind
microtubule (Figure S6, comparing SYK 0.4 µg sample plus/minus ATP), but the presence
of R406 further increased their binding.

SYK inhibition stabilizes microtubules in paclitaxel resistant tumor cells co-treated with
paclitaxel

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Two different approaches were used to determine whether inhibiting SYK activity would
stabilize microtubules. First, we assessed two markers of microtubule stability, acetylated αtubulin (L’Hernault and Rosenbaum, 1985) (Piperno and Fuller, 1985) and detyrosinated
(Glu) α-tubulin (Gundersen et al., 1984; Thompson, 1977). Western blot analysis
demonstrated that paclitaxel markedly increased both acetylated and detyrosinated tubulin
levels in paclitaxel sensitive SKOV3 and MPSC1 cells but the effect was only modest in
paclitaxel resistant SKOV3TR and MPSC1TR cells (Figure 7A), indicating that the
paclitaxel resistant cells had developed a mechanism(s), presumably by increasing
phosphorylation of tubulin and MAPs (Figure 5E), to counteract paclitaxel-induced
microtubule stability. Neither acetylated nor detyrosinated tubulin levels were altered by
R406 alone at the applied concentration (2.5 mM) in either paclitaxel resistant cell line,
although R406 at a higher concentration increased the levels of acetylated α-tubulin in
paclitaxel sensitive and resistant SKOV3 cells (Figure S7A). Compared to vehicle control,
R406 alone, and paclitaxel alone, R406 and paclitaxel combination significantly increases
the level of acetyl-α-tubulin in SKOV3TR and MPSCTR cells. This finding was not
observed in naive cells because they are highly sensitive to paclitaxel in stabilizing
microtubules at the given paclitaxel concentration (Figure 7A). Combination with other SYK
inhibitors showed similar results (Figure S7B). The above findings were confirmed by
immunofluorescence (Figure S7C). Ovarian cancer cell lines, KK, KOC7C and OVTOKO,
all of which were more resistant to paclitaxel than the naive SKOV3 and MPSC1 cells
showed similar enhancement of acetylated α-tubulin in the combination treatment (Figure
7A). To further extrapolate the finding to an in vivo setting, we compared levels of acetyl-α
tubulin in SKOV3c.2 tumor xenografts in mice treated with paclitaxel, R406, or their
combination. We observed a significant increase in the acetylated-α tubulin level in tumor
xenografts treated with combined R406 and paclitaxel (Figure 7B). The results of these
experiments suggested that inhibition of SYK in the presence of paclitaxel augmented
microtubule stabilization and cytotoxicity in paclitaxel resistant tumor cells that were
otherwise insensitive to paclitaxel.

In the second approach, we applied live-cell microscopy to record microtubule dynamics in
SKOV3 and SKOV3TR cells stably transfected with GFP-α-tubulin. We used the
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique to measure the speed of
microtubule turnover in these cells. We observed that cells treated with R406 alone (2.5
mM) did not show any detectable changes in fluorescence recovery in SKOV3 cells. As
expected, SKOV3 cells responded to paclitaxel treatment with a reduced mobile fraction and
an increased half-life after photobleaching (Figure 7C). In contrast, SKOV3TR cells were
less responsive to paclitaxel, but adding R406 (2.5 mM) to paclitaxel (30 nM) significantly
reduced fluorescence recovery, including a decreased mobile fraction and an increased halflife (Figure 7D). In SKOV3TR cells, R406 alone only slightly increased the half-life of
fluorescence recovery and did not have a significant effect on mobile fractions. Thus, FRAP
analysis confirmed that SYK inactivation promoted paclitaxel-induced stabilization of
microtubules in paclitaxel resistant cancer cells.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

This study provides biological basis and preclinical evidence that targeting SYK sensitizes
tumor cells for paclitaxel, especially for those that have developed paclitaxel resistance. It is
likely that the paclitaxel resistant cells with higher SYK levels and activity have developed a
molecular mechanism that counteracts paclitaxel-mediated microtubule stabilization, thus
reducing paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity. Our finding validates a previous hypothesis that
modulating microtubule stability can enhance the cytotoxic response of ovarian cancer cells
to paclitaxel (Ahmed et al., 2011). Indeed, by analyzing the SYK substrates in paclitaxelresistant ovarian cancer cells, we identified tubulin and MAPs as substrates of SYK, raising
the possibility that SYK inactivation affects microtubule dynamics. The role of SYK in
cancer therapeutics has also been reported by others. SYK activity has been demonstrated to
play an important role in imatinib or nilotinib resistance in CML (Gioia et al., 2011) and the
pentapeptide mimic targeting the substrate binding site of SYK has an anti-tumor effect on
chemotherapy resistant relapsed B-precursor leukemia cells (Uckun et al., 2010a).

Author Manuscript

How SYK tyrosine phosphorylation affects the functions of tubulin and MAPs is not clear.
Faruki et al. reported that tubulin, upon SYK-mediated phosphorylation, was able to
assemble into microtubules (Faruki et al., 2000), but the effects on microtubule dynamics
remain to be determined. This is further complicated by SYK-mediated phosphorylation on
many microtubule interacting proteins such as MAP1B and MAP4 that also play critical
roles in microtubule dynamics (Krisenko et al., 2014). MAP1B and MAP4 bind to
microtubules and facilitate their polymerization and stabilization. Since serine
phosphorylation of MAPs has been shown to decrease interactions of MAPs and
microtubules, promoting microtubule dynamics (Chang et al., 2001; Goold et al., 1999;
Trivedi et al., 2005), it is likely that tyrosine phosphorylation by SYK has a similar effect
because SYK phosphorylates MAP4 at tyrosine Y1001 which resides in the conserved
microtubule binding domain of MAP4.
The observation that R406 alone is sufficient to reduce cellular proliferation at doses that
does not significantly affect microtubule stability suggests that the anti-proliferative activity
of R406 can also be attributed to inactivation of SYK-regulated tumor-promoting pathways.

By analyzing the SILAC data, we also identified several SYK substrates that belong to
canonical tumor-promoting pathways. These include STAT3, which has been reported as a
substrate for SYK in hematopoietic cells (Uckun et al., 2010b). R406 markedly reduces
phosphorylation of STAT3 tyrosine residues Y704 and Y705, the latter of which is
associated with STAT3 activity and its anti-apoptotic effect (Chen et al., 2008). In addition,
we identified a group of SYK substrates including PIK3R1/2 and adapter proteins, GAB1/2
and SHC, that are involved in the growth factor/PI3K signaling. These proteins generally
couple signaling among activated growth factor receptors upon ligand binding such as
VEGF, EGF, IGF1 and HGF (Holgado-Madruga and Wong, 2003) with PI3K signaling
pathway, which has been known to participate in chemoresistance (Koti et al., 2013). Thus,
our data suggest that the anti-tumor effects of inactivating SYK come from two broad
mechanisms- stabilizing microtubule and suppressing growth-promoting signaling pathways.
For the latter, we were able to demonstrate that R406 suppressed phosphorylation of other
SYK substrates including pSTAT3 and pAKT of which phosphorylation was reported to
protect tumor cells from chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. However, unlike the synergistic
effect on microtubule stability, adding paclitaxel did not further reduce their phosphorylation
levels (data not shown). Thus, we focus on the biological effects of targeting SYK signaling
on microtubule dynamics.

Microtubules have been well established as a major target for cancer treatment. The antimitotic microtubule targeting drugs include 1) vinca alkaloids (vinblastine, vincristine,
vindesine, and vinorelbine) that bind to α and β-tubulin heterodimers, preventing their
incorporation into microtubules and microtubule polymerization, and 2) microtubulestabilizing agents such as paclitaxel and docetaxel (collectively known as taxanes) that
directly interact with and stabilize microtubules (Liu et al., 2014). Thus, SYK inhibitors
represent another group of drugs that affect microtubules through regulating phosphorylation
of tubulin and MAPs. The different mechanisms used by SYK inhibitors and paclitaxel may
explain their synergistic effect in cancer cells, especially in those that developed paclitaxel
resistance. Our results may have important clinical ramifications because taxanes are
frequently used in treating several major types of cancer such as breast and lung carcinoma
in addition to ovarian carcinoma. Since development of taxane resistance is common,
introduction of regimens to overcome paclitaxel resistance is an unmet need.

The main SYK inhibitor used in this study is R406, the active form of fostamatinib (also
known as R788), which is orally administrable and highly tolerable when used in late phase
clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis, auto-immune diseases, and hematologic malignancies
(Friedberg et al., 2010; Podolanczuk et al., 2009; Weinblatt et al., 2010). Several clinical
trials of fostamatinib have reported its pharmacokinetics and safety profile at a range of
doses up to 250 mg twice daily (Friedberg et al., 2010; Weinblatt et al., 2008). The plasma
concentration reported from these studies ranges between 300 – 1,800 ng/mL (molar
concentration 0.5 – 2.9 µM), which is relevant to the R406 concentrations used in our
experiments. Therefore, the availability of fostamatinib and the minimal overlap between
observed clinical toxicities of fostamatinib and paclitaxel would facilitate the translation of
the current preclinical study (Weinblatt et al., 2010). For example, results of our study
warrant determining the benefit of adding fostamatinib to the weekly paclitaxel dense
regimen in treating recurrent ovarian cancer.

Finally, it should be noted that the current study focuses on demonstrating the direct function
of SYK on microtubule constituents and concludes that the major mechanism for SYK
inhibitors to sensitize paclitaxel effects is through altering the SYK-MAP-tubulin axis. Since
SYK may have multiple roles in promoting tumor progression, it should not be construed
that other SYK-regulated microtubule-independent pathways are not involved in paclitaxel
resistance. In fact, this study also validated that both STAT3 and AKT were the substrates of
SYK and their inhibition can enhance cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents although the
underlying mechanisms are yet to be further elucidated (Lin et al., 2015) (Abubaker et al.,
2014).

Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded ovarian cancer tissues were obtained from the
Department of Pathology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland. All studies
were Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board exempt as
no protected health information was used. To compare the expression levels of SYK in
paired recurrent post-chemotherapy ovarian HGSC and their primary untreated tumors, we
performed immunohistochemistry. The primary tumors from HGSC patients were optimally
debulked to a residual tumor volume less than 1 cm, and all patients received standard
carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy for 3–6 cycles. Paraffin tissues were arranged in tissue
microarrays to facilitate immunohistochemistry and to ensure that tissues were stained under
the same conditions. The 214 effusions were obtained from the Norwegian Radium Hospital
(177 peritoneal, 37 pleural) were from 211 patients (2 patients had 2 effusions) diagnosed
with serous carcinoma in the years 1998–2005. One-hundred and twenty-three effusions
were collected at diagnosis prior to chemotherapy, whereas 88 effusions were postchemotherapy specimens, collected at disease recurrence. Data regarding previous
chemotherapy was unavailable for 3 patients. The FIGO stages were 1 patient with stage I, 4
with stage II, 127 with stage III and 82 with stage IV disease. Residual tumor volume was
≤1 in 86 cases, >1 cm in 95 cases, unknown in 33 cases. The majority of patients (n=193)
received platinum-based chemotherapy at diagnosis.

Author Manuscript

Chemotherapy response was classified as complete response: 117 patients; partial response:
31 patients; stable disease: 12 patients; progression: 28 patients. The disease response after
chemotherapy for the remaining cases (n=23) could not be evaluated because of adverse
effects, normal CA-125 after primary surgery or missing CA-125 information and no grossly
residual tumor. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research
Ethics in Norway. Comparative analysis was performed for patients with complete response
versus partial response/stable disease/progression. The statistical program used was SPSS
version 18. The test for association with chemotherapy response was Mann-Whitney.
The mouse monoclonal anti-SYK antibody [4D10.1] (Abcam ab3113), anti-phospho-SYK
(Tyr525/526) antibody (CST #2711), anti-α tubulin (phospho Y272) antibody [EP1334(2)Y]
(Abcam ab76290) were used, and its specificity was confirmed by Western blotting. The

specificity of anti-phospho-SYK (Y525/526) antibody in immunohistochemistry was
previously validated using anti-BCR stimulated B-lymphoma cells and tissues (Cheng et al.,
2011). Citrate-based Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO) was used for antigen retrieval (95–
100°C for 20 min). The sections were then incubated with the primary antibody at 4°C
overnight and the appropriate secondary antibody at room temperature for 30 min.
Colorimetric development was detected by the EnVision+System (DAKO). Sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin, and immunoreactivity was scored using the H-score
system by two investigators based on the percentage of positively stained cells and the
intensity of staining, which ranged from 0 to 3+. A composite score was determined by
multiplying the intensity and extent scores
Xenograft mouse tumor models

Author Manuscript

Two models were employed in this study. In the subcutaneous tumor model, a tumorigenic
line of SKOV3 cells, SKOV3c.2 cells, were mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously (5×106 cells/injection) into female nu/nu mice.
Tumor growth was monitored by measurements of tumor diameters, and the tumor volume
was calculated. Treatment with drugs started as soon as the tumor became palpable. At the
end of treatment, all tumors were excised, weighed and confirmed by histology. For BrdU
incorporation, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 150 mg/kg and sacrificed 2 hr postinjection. Tumor cells that had incorporated BrdU were detected in paraffin embedded
sections with an anti-BrdU antibody. The number of total tumor cells and positively stained
tumor cells were counted.

Author Manuscript

In the intraperitoneal tumor model, SKOV3 luciferase expressing cells (5 × 106) were
injected intraperitoneally into female nu/nu nude mice. Paclitaxel treatment was initiated
when luminescence signal reached > 2×106 photons/s. Mice were treated with vehicle
(control) or paclitaxel intraperitoneally three times per week for up to 7 weeks. Tumor
burden was measured weekly in mice injected with d-luciferin using the IVIS Spectrum In
Vivo Imager. IC50 of paclitaxel was determined in primary cultures established from
individual tumors. Paclitaxel resistant cells were expanded and re-injected i.p. to a new
cohort of mice to examine the anti-tumor activity of single agent R406, paclitaxel or the
combination. When tumor luminescence signals exceeded 2×106 photons/s, mice received
intraperitoneal administration of vehicle control, R406 (10 mg/kg), paclitaxel (10 mg/kg) or
the combination three times per week. All of the animal procedures were approved by the
Johns Hopkins University Animal Care Committee.
Fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching (FRAP)

Author Manuscript

SKOV3 and SKOV3TR cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP-α-tubulin,
and multiple positive clones were pooled for further expansion. Photo-bleaching procedures
were performed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The dynamics parameters
recorded from FRAP included the fraction of microtubules that recovered within 2 min post
photo bleaching (mobility fraction), and the time it took for half of the mobile fraction of
microtubules to recover (t1/2). Regions of interest were bleached for 10 s followed by 2 min
of observation, with image acquisition every 2 s. At least 12–15 observations were recorded

and unbleached regions within the cell of interest (Daniels et al., 2009).

SIGNIFICANCE
There is an unmet need to introduce more effective drugs to enhance therapeutic effects
of current chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we demonstrated that inactivating Spleen
Tyrosine Kinase (SYK) using small compound inhibitors sensitized cells to the cytotoxic
effects of paclitaxel, overcoming paclitaxel resistance. We found that SYK inhibitors
stabilized microtubules through dephosphorylation of microtubule and microtubuleassociated proteins, a mechanism that is distinct from paclitaxel. As a result, SYK
inhibitor and paclitaxel formed a synergistic cytotoxicity effect in tumor cells, especially
in those that were paclitaxel-resistant. Our results provide critical pre-clinical evidence
proposing for the use of SYK inhibitors in combination with paclitaxel in cancer patients,
and warrant future clinical studies to assess the clinical benefit of such combined therapy.
