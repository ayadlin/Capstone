Abstract
Because of its relatively indolent clinical course, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) offers a versatile model
for testing novel therapeutic regimens and drug combinations. Nicotinamide is the main NADþ precursor and a
direct inhibitor of four classes of enzymes, including the sirtuins. SIRT1, the main member of the sirtuin family,
inactivates p53 by deacetylating a critical lysine residue. In this study, we showed that CLL cells express high
levels of functional SIRT1, which is inhibited by exogenous nicotinamide. This agent blocks proliferation and
promotes apoptosis selectively in leukemic cells that express wild-type (wt) p53. Nicotinamide modulates the
p53-dependent genes p21, NOXA, BAX, and Mcl-1, indicating an activation of the p53 pathway and of caspase-3.
DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, such as etoposide, activate a functional loop linking SIRT1 and p53 through
the induction of miR-34a. When leukemic cells are simultaneously exposed to nicotinamide and etoposide, we
observe a significant increase in miR-34a levels with a concomitant inhibition of SIRT1. Furthermore, p53
acetylation levels are higher than with either agent used alone. Overall, treatment with both nicotinamde and
etoposide shows strongly synergistic effects in the induction of apoptosis. We therefore concluded that
nicotinamide has the dual property of inhibiting SIRT1 through a noncompetitive enzymatic block (p53
independent) and at the same time through miR-34a induction (p53 dependent). These observations suggested
the therapeutic potential of nicotinamide, a novel, safe, and inexpensive drug, to be used in addition to
chemotherapy for CLL patients with wt p53. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4473–83. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
NADþ, an essential cofactor in the oxidative phosphorylation chain (1), is a substrate for 4 classes of enzymes (2, 3),
involved in genomic stability, apoptosis, cell signaling, stress
tolerance, and metabolism (4–7). Among these enzymes,
sirtuins catalyze the deacetylation of acetyl-lysine residues
by cleaving NADþ and generating O-acetyl ADP-ribose. When
active, these enzymes consume NADþ and release nicotinamide, in turn a direct inhibitor of enzyme activities and the

main precursor of NADþ in most mammalian cells (8). Hence,
substrates (NADþ), enzymes, and final products (nicotinamide) are linked in a dynamic balance, in which nicotinamide
may be considered a master regulator (8, 9). SIRT1, the major
mammalian member of the sirtuin family, deacetylates histones and nonhistone proteins, including p53, Ku70, and
FOXO (10, 11). For these reasons, its functions are implicated
in the regulation of aging, circadian rhythm, and endocrine
signaling (12). SIRT1 is upregulated in several human tumor
types, including breast and colon cancers (13), in which it may
work as an oncogene by suppressing p53 functions. Indeed,
p53 deacetylation mediated by SIRT1 leads to functional
inactivation (14). The consequence is that an increase in
SIRT1 expression and function is followed by a decrease in
the active form of p53, leading to genome instability and
resistance to apoptosis, among the other effects (15, 16). For
these reasons, there is intense investigation in designing
molecular tools that inhibit sirtuins. Besides nicotinamide,
these include NADþ analogs, direct kinase inhibitors, suramins, and compounds identified by using computational
approaches (17, 18).
Because of a longstanding experience in the use of nicotinamide for the treatment of pellagra and the lack of reported
side effects (19), this agent is in the pipeline of SIRT1 inhibitors
to be tested in clinical settings. This work was designed
to address the in vitro effects of nicotinamide on chronic

lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, selected as disease model.
CLL is characterized by the progressive expansion of a population of mature monoclonal B lymphocytes expressing CD5
(20). These cells are intrinsically resistant to apoptosis, limiting the therapeutic efficacy of many drugs. Furthermore, CLL
has been a playground to test regimens that combine chemotherapy with other drugs, mostly immunomodulatory
agents, reaching previously unattained response rates (21).
From the biological standpoint, the signaling pathways operative in CLL lymphocytes are well characterized, offering an
accessible model for studying the effects of old and new drugs
(22).
The results of this study confirm that CLL cells are characterized by increased expression and function of SIRT1, both
directly inhibited by exposure to nicotinamide. Treatment of
CLL cells with this agent leads to a block of proliferation and
induction of apoptosis, which is dependent on the activation
of the p53 pathway. These effects substantiate the existence of
a tumor suppressor network, linking p53 and SIRT1 through
miR-34a. It seems that nicotinamide may potentiate the
effects of chemotherapeutics, which operate through a p53mediated apoptosis, thus becoming a potential adjunct in the
treatment of selected CLL patients.

Materials and Methods
Patients and cells
Following informed consent, peripheral blood samples
were obtained from 65 patients fulfilling diagnostic and
immunophenotypic criteria for CLL (Supplementary
Table S1). Blood samples were from age- and sex-matched
donors, whereas tonsils from children undergoing surgery at
the Regina Margherita Hospital (Turin, Italy). Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque (GE Healthcare) centrifugation, were cultured in RPMI1640 þ 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). B lymphocytes were
purified by negative selection by using anti-CD3, -CD14, and
-CD16 antibodies (produced and purified in-house) and
Dynal magnetic beads (Invitrogen; ref. 23), with a purity
of more than 95%.
Antibodies and reagents
Antibodies used were anti-SIRT1 (Upstate-Millipore Biotechnology), anti-p53, anti–acetylated-Lys382-p53, and anti–
caspase-3 (both from Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-Mcl1,
anti-BAX, anti-p21, and anti-actin horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)–conjugated, (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
anti-NOXA (Imgenex). Secondary reagents were goat antimouse IgG-HRP conjugated (GaMIgG-HRP; Perkin Elmer)
and goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (GaR-HRP; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).
Nicotinamide, recombinant human interleukin (IL)-2 (rhIL-2, 100 IU/mL) and etoposide (50 mmol/L) were from Sigma.
CpG oligonucleotide (1 mg/mL, InvivoGen) and carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE, 10 mmol/L; Invitrogen) were also used. p53 short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)
lentiviral particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to
inhibit p53 expression.

Proliferation assays
Cell were labeled with CFSE (24) and incubated with CpG/
IL-2. Nicotinamide (1.2–10 mmol/L dose range) was added at
the beginning of culture. Proliferation was measured after
5 days by staining with anti-CD19PE (Aczon). Cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry, by using a fluorescence-activated
cell sorting CantoII equipment (BD Biosciences) and the Diva
and WinMDI softwares. Cell proliferation was also measured
by [3H]-thymidine (Amersham Bioscience Buckinghamshire)
incorporation at day 5. The percentage of proliferating cells
was calculated as [(number of proliferated cells/total number
of cells)  100].
Apoptosis assays
Apoptosis was measured by using the Annexin-V fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Apoptosis Kit (Invitrogen). Data
are presented as density plots of Annexin-V FITC (AV, x-axis)
and propidium iodide (PI, y-axis) stainings. The percentage of
apoptotic cells was calculated by adding AVþ/AVþPIþ/PIþ
cells.
Caspase-3 activity was measured by using the human active
caspase-3 immunoassay (R&D Systems Europe). Optical density (OD) was detected by using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek
Instruments) set to 450 nm (wavelength correction set to 540
nm). Enzymatic activities were expressed as arbitrary OD units.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed (25), resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Upstate-Millipore).
Blots were incubated with the indicated antibodies and developed by using enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin Elmer).
The human embryonic kidney 293T cell line was used as
positive control for SIRT1 expression. Densitometric analyses
were done on scanned films by using the public domain
ImageJ software.
Nuclear extracts
Nuclear extraction was done as previously described (26).
SIRT1 enzymatic activity assay
SIRT1 activity was determined by using the SIRT1 Fluorimetric Kit (Enzo Life Sciences UK) and expressed as arbitrary
fluorescent units (AFU).
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent (Sigma) and converted
to cDNA by using the reverse transcription kit (Applied
Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted by using the 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR System
(SDS2.3 software), using commercially available primers (all
from Applied Biosystems). Reactions were done in triplicate
from the same cDNA reaction (technical replicates). Comparative CT methods was used to calculate the relative
expression of the gene under analysis.
Statistics
Data are expressed as the means  SD. Student's t test was
used to evaluate statistical significance.

SIRT1 Inhibition Induces Apoptosis of CLL Cells

Results
SIRT1 levels are significantly higher in CLL than in
normal B lymphocytes
SIRT1 is a NADþ-dependent nuclear deacetylase, often
overexpressed in solid tumors (27–29). qRT-PCR data
showed that CLL cells (n ¼ 15) express significantly higher
levels of SIRT1 when compared with a pool of normal B cells
purified from the PB of adult age- and sex-matched donors
(n ¼ 6) and from tonsil B cell preparations (n ¼ 4), obtained
from children (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1A). The levels of SIRT1 mRNA
in normal B cells were constantly lower than in CLL cells,
independently of the age of the donor or the activation
status of the cell. Analyses at the protein level confirm that
CLL cells express more SIRT1 protein than normal B lymphocytes (P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 1A), providing evidence that SIRT1
overexpression is a hallmark of tumor transformation also in
the CLL context. In line with the increased expression,
nuclear extracts from CLL cells (n ¼ 15) contained significantly more SIRT1 activity when compared with normal B
cells (n ¼ 5, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1B).
SIRT1 functions are inhibited by nicotinamide in CLL
cells
We then asked whether nicotinamide, the main precursor
of NADþ and a noncompetitive inhibitor of SIRT1 (30, 31), is
active in leukemic cells. The in vitro inhibitory effects of
nicotinamide on recombinant human SIRT1 were confirmed
by showing that with 5 and 10 mmol/L doses SIRT1 deacetylation activity was completely inhibited (Fig. 1C). Culture
of CLL lymphocytes in the presence of the same doses of
nicotinamide was followed by a marked inhibition of the
deacetylation activity of endogenous SIRT1, as present in
nuclear extracts (P ¼ 0.005; Fig. 1C). The effect was evident
after 20 minutes exposure to nicotinamide (Fig. 1C) and was
maintained when cells were cultured for 60 minutes (not
shown). SIRT1 inhibition in CLL cells was independent of
negative prognostic markers, such as CD38 expression, the
mutational status of the IgVH genes, and deletions/mutations of p53 (del/mut p53; ref. Fig. 1D). This inhibition was
not apparent in similar experiments on normal B lymphocytes (P ¼ 0.94; Fig. 1C).
Nicotinamide treatment blocks proliferation of CLL
cells in a p53-dependent manner
We then investigated the effects of nicotinamide on CLL
cells by analyzing changes in proliferation and apoptosis, 2
biological processes in which SIRT1 is involved, through the
modulation of the p53 pathway.
CFSE-labeled purified CLL cells from 20 patients were
activated by using an agonist specific for toll-like receptor
9 (TLR9) and IL-2 (32; ref. Fig. 2A). Proliferation was significantly inhibited in the presence of nicotinamide (P < 0.0001;
Fig. 2A and B), in a dose-dependent way (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1). Proliferation of normal B lymphocytes was
only partially affected by nicotinamide (P ¼ 0.050; Fig. 2A and
B), implying that normal B cells are less sensitive than CLL
cells, in line with their low constitutive levels of SIRT1.

www.aacrjournals.org

These inhibitory effects were apparently independent of
negative prognostic markers, including surface CD38 expression (P < 0.0001 for CD38þ and P ¼ 0.001 for CD38 patients;
Fig. 2C) and IgVH mutational status (P ¼ 0.007 for IgVH UM
and P ¼ 0.001 for IgVH MUT patients; Fig. 2C). A relevant
exception was represented by patients with p53 inactivation,
resistant to the effects of nicotinamide (P ¼ 0.0007 for wildtype (wt) p53 and P ¼ 0.42 for del/mut p53 patients; Fig. 2C;
ref. 33).
Nicotinamide treatment induces apoptosis of CLL cells
in a p53-dependent manner
Attention was then focused on apoptosis, constitutively
high in CLL cells cultured in vitro. CLL cells (n ¼ 20) and
control nonneoplastic B lymphocytes (n ¼ 6) were incubated
with 3 different concentrations of nicotinamide (5, 10, and 50
mmol/L) for 72 hours and then labeled with Annexin-V–FITC
(AV) and PI (Fig. 3A). Even in the presence of the lowest
concentration tested (5 mmol/L; Fig. 3A and B), CLL cell
viability was significantly reduced at day 3 (P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 3B).
The effect was dose and time dependent, starting after only 6
hours exposure and peaking at day 3 (Fig. 3C). In contrast,
normal B cells entered apoptosis only in the presence of 50
mmol/L nicotinamide (Fig. 3B). As with the proliferation
experiments, CLL cells behaved in a homogeneous manner,
when the cohort was divided on the basis of CD38 expression
(P ¼ 0.05 for CD38þ and P ¼ 0.04 for CD38 patients; Fig. 3D)
or IgVH mutational status (P ¼ 0.05 for IgVH UM and P ¼ 0.03
for IgVH MUT patients; Fig. 3D). On the contrary, patients
with p53 inactivation were resistant to apoptosis when compared with the rest of the cohort (P ¼ 0.008 for wt p53 and P ¼
0.11 for del/mut p53 patients; Fig. 3D).
Nicotinamide treatment activates the p53 pathway
In line with the hypothesis that the activities of SIRT1 rely
on the presence of a functional p53 protein, treatment of wt
p53 CLL cells with nicotinamide induced p53 protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P ¼ 0.02 with 5
mmol/L and P ¼ 0.004 with 10 mmol/L; Fig. 4A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S2). p53 controls the cell cycle by modulating p21, in turn inducing G1-phase arrest by cyclin-dependent kinase-2 inhibition (34). p21 activation was confirmed in
wt p53 CLL samples treated with nicotinamide (P ¼ 0.04 with
5 mmol/L and P ¼ 0.001 with 10 mmol/L; Fig. 4A and B), in line
with previous results showing that increased p53 acetylation
at lysines 373/382 (K382 is deacetylated by SIRT1) induces p21
expression (16, 35).
Moreover, nicotinamide treatment increased expression of
NOXA (P ¼ 0.001 at both 5 and 10 mmol/L; Fig. 4A and B) and
BAX (P ¼ 0.001 with 5 mmol/L and P ¼ 0.007 with 10 mmol/L;
Fig. 4A and B) with a concomitant decrease of the prosurvival
Mcl-1 protein (P ¼ 0.02 with 5 mmol/L and P ¼ 0.0006 with 10
mmol/L; Fig. 4A and B). Protein modulation was measurable
after 6 hours, and was highly reproducible in the 5 patients
studied. The end effect was the dose-dependent activation of
caspase-3, with the onset of apoptosis (P ¼ 0.02 with 5 mmol/L
and P ¼ 0.003 with 10 mmol/L, Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).
Results showed a reduction in total caspase-3 protein levels

and a concomitant increase in caspase-3 activity, measured in
10 CLL patients after 24 hours exposure to 10 mmol/L
nicotinamide (P ¼ 0.03; Supplementary Fig. S3C). Altogether,
these changes suggested that nicotinamide activates a p53dependent pathway, leading to mitochondrial apoptosis via
upregulation of NOXA and BAX and downmodulation of the
Mcl-1 protein (36), directly induced by NOXA (37). They also
strongly suggested that nicotinamide is able to interfere with
the proliferative response and apoptotic program of CLL cells,
by activating the p53 pathway.
SIRT1 is part of a p53/miR-34a tumor suppressor
network
The next issue was whether nicotinamide might synergize
with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, known to activate a
p53-regulated loop which involves miR-34a (38, 39), in turn
targeting SIRT1 (40).
To this purpose, wt p53 CLL cells (n ¼ 10) were treated with
50 mmol/L etoposide (a DNA-damaging agent that activates
the p53 pathway in a time- and dose-dependent manner; ref.
16) alone or in combination with nicotinamide (6 hours, 37 C)
and checked for miR-34a levels. Etoposide treatment
increased miR-34a levels and the same effect was observed
by using nicotinamide, although the difference was not significant in either case. The combination of etoposide and
nicotinamide resulted in a marked induction of miR-34a, as

www.aacrjournals.org

compared with basal levels (P ¼ 0.009) or to either agent used
alone (P ¼ 0.03, in both instances), in all cases studied
(Fig. 5A). A cohort of CLL patients (n ¼ 5) del/mut p53
was used as the control. These patients displayed constitutively lower miR-34a levels than p53 wt CLL patients (139.1 
73 vs. 43.8  31; P ¼ 0.04), not significantly modulated under
any experimental condition (Fig. 5A). This finding was in line
with recent studies showing that CLL patients featuring low
levels of miR-34a lack p53 or express a dysfunctional protein
(41, 42). Normal B lymphocytes (n ¼ 5) were more resistant to
etoposide-mediated apoptosis (not shown), and consistently
failed to modulate the miR-34a pathway (Fig. 5A). These
findings indicated that (i) the increase in miR-34a requires
p53 activation, (ii) miR-34a is directly involved in the p53dependent response to DNA damage in CLL cells, and (iii)
nicotinamide synergizes with etoposide in the activation of
the pathway.
Translational repression of the target SIRT1 mRNA following
nicotinamide/etoposide exposure was verified by simultaneously measuring miR-34a and SIRT1 mRNA levels in the
different treatment conditions. Nicotinamide/etoposide exposure selectively resulted in the inverse correlation between the
miR and its target, that is, high levels of miR-34a were paralleled
by low levels of SIRT1 mRNA (r ¼ 0.75; P ¼ 0.005; Fig. 5B),
further supporting the notion of a functional cooperation
between these 2 agents in the regulation of the network.

Fig. S4). Consistent with the activation of p53, the combination of nicotinamide and etoposide induced the highest levels
of acetylated p53 at lysine 382 (P < 0.0001 vs. basal, P < 0.0001
vs. nicotinamide alone, and P ¼ 0.007 vs. etoposide; Fig. 6A), an
event directly regulated by SIRT1 and influencing activation of
the molecule (39). Patients with del/mut p53 and did not
express detectable p53 protein and failed to modulate it in
response to either treatment, independently or in combination (not shown). Normal B lymphocytes revealed no activation of this network with no detectable modification of p53
levels (not shown).
These data indicated that the p53/miR-34a/SIRT1 network
is operative in CLL cells with a wt p53 and that nicotinamide
enhances this pathway by negatively regulating SIRT1. This
was substantiated also by a strong synergism between etoposide and nicotinamide in the induction of apoptosis, selectively in cells with a wt p53 protein (P < 0.0001; Fig. 6B and C).
Patients with del/mut p53 were significantly less responsive to
etoposide treatment, as expected, and a limited functional
synergy was observed when adding nicotinamide (P ¼ 0.01;
Fig. 6B and C). The formal proof linking nicotinamide effects
to the activation of the p53 tumor suppressor network was
obtained by silencing p53 in wt CLL patients. Treatment with
lentiviral particles carrying shRNA specific for p53 was followed by 30% reduction of expression of the target mRNA
(not shown) and by a decreased sensitivity to nicotinamideinduced apoptosis, as compared with the same cells treated
with a control virus (Fig. 6D). The combination of the 2 drugs
led to a limited functional synergy, when compared with the
apoptosis induced by etoposide alone (P ¼ 0.2). This effect was
lower than what scored by p53 wt CLL cells (P ¼ 0.0004), and
by CLL cells treated with a control virus (P ¼ 0.005). This
behavior was comparable with what observed in the naturally
occurring del/mut p53 subset, confirming that the integrity
of the p53 pathway is critical for nicotinamide actions
(Fig. 6B–D).

SIRT1 is a class III nuclear deacetylase that can activate or
repress genetic programs by modifying histones and transcription factors. The first finding of this work is that the
enzyme is overexpressed and overfunctional in CLL cells,
taking normal B lymphocytes as a comparison. This is in
keeping with independent observations linking increased
expression of the enzyme to tumor transformation (10).
The translational inference is that targeting SIRT1 could lead
to modulation of pathways regulating tumor growth and
progression. Nicotinamide, a known feedback inhibitor of
SIRT1, was selected in virtue of its experienced use in the
therapy of pellagra and of the lack of toxicity, even in the
presence of high levels of the drug (43). The results of this work
confirm that exposure to nicotinamide is followed by a significant drop in the enzymatic activity of SIRT1. The effects
are specific for CLL cells, whereas normal B lymphocytes are
not influenced. These findings represent the basis for proposing nicotinamide as a powerful inhibitor for this deacetylase,
at doses reported to be achievable in vivo (43).

SIRT1 inhibition by nicotinamide leads to a block of proliferation and to the activation of apoptosis. These effects are
comparatively more apparent in leukemic lymphocytes than
in normal mature B cells. Furthermore, they seem to be strictly
dependent on the presence of a functional p53 protein: indeed,
the same effects are not detectable in cells from patients with
a mutated or deleted p53. Because SIRT1 is reported to
inactivate p53 by deacetylating a critical lysine residue, it is
reasonable to hypothesize that a block of SIRT1 may lead to
the activation of the p53 pathway. Confirms were obtained by
showing that nicotinamide exposure induces activation of the
p53-dependent genes p21, NOXA, and BAX, which may contribute at various degrees to the proliferation block and to the
onset of apoptosis. Moreover, nicotinamide exposure downregulates Mcl-1, a direct target of NOXA, as confirmed also in
primary CLL cells (37). A link between SIRT1 and p53 in the
induction of apoptosis has been previously shown by showing
that SIRT1 inactivation is followed by reduced survival and
increased expression of p53 targets (15). Other supporting
data come from Drosophila models, in which a decrease in
nicotinamide levels, obtained by overexpressing the enzyme
nicotinamidase, prolongs fly life span (44). Similarly, reduction
of nicotinamide levels in human neuronal cells induces protection from apoptosis and from oxidative stress (44). In both
instances, the effects were attributed to a functional modulation of SIRT1, inhibited by nicotinamide.
Considered together, these findings led to the hypothesis
that nicotinamide may be useful in potentiating p53 activation

driven by chemotherapeutic agents. By inducing DNA damage,
these drugs activate a p53-regulated loop, which involves the
miR-34 family (38). miR-34a, the most studied component of
the family, mediates some of the functional consequences,
including apoptosis (45). SIRT1 displays the dual characteristic of being a target of miR-34a and, simultaneously, an
inhibitor of p53, suggesting that nicotinamide may work
synergistically with chemotherapeutics in inducing apoptosis.
The administration of a combination of nicotinamide and
etoposide (selected as a prototype chemotherapeutic) to CLL
cells significantly enhanced miR-34a expression, SIRT1 inhibition and p53 activity, as compared with either agent used
alone (Fig. 7). The same treatment also led to a net increase in
whole p53 levels. The picture taking shape in the CLL cell is
that these 3 players are linked in a positive feedback loop, in
which DNA damage induces p53, which in turn induces miR34a, which represses SIRT1 (40). Thus, nicotinamide inhibits
SIRT1 through 2 clearly distinct mechanisms, 1 linked to a
noncompetitive enzymatic block (p53-independent), whereas
the second is mediated via miR-34a (p53-dependent; Fig. 7).
The increase in the acetylated form of p53 obtained by
nicotinamide treatment may also be instrumental in preventing ubiquitination of key lysine residues by the MDM2 enzyme
and subsequent proteasomal degradation (46). A direct interplay between the MDM2 enzyme and p53 in tumor models,
including CLL, influences not only tumorigenesis but also
treatment outcome (47, 48). The upshot is that a treatment
with nicotinamide combined with etoposide reduces CLL cell

Figure 7. Schematic representation of the effects of nicotinamide on
the p53/miR-34a/SIRT1 network in CLL cells. Activation of p53 following
DNA damage increases miR-34a transcription, which in turn suppresses
SIRT1 translation. The outcome is an increase in the acetylated functional
form of p53, as part of a positive feedback loop. Addition of nicotinamide
provides independent inhibition of SIRT1 and further upregulation of
miR-34a (red pathway), with a resulting modulation of p53-dependent
genes including NOXA, BAX, Mcl-1, and p21. The final outcome for the
CLL cell is a block of the cell cycle and a strong induction of apoptosis,
potentiating the effects of chemotherapy. Nam, nicotinamide.

The above results may provide a preliminary rationale
for the design of a clinical trial to test the effects of oral
administration of nicotinamide in combination with DNAdamaging chemotherapeutics in CLL patients with wt p53. A
