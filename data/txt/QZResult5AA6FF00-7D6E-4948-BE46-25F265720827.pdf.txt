Abstract
Treatment regimens for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continue to offer weak clinical outcomes. Through a high-throughput
cell-based screen, we identiﬁed avocatin B, a lipid derived from
avocado fruit, as a novel compound with cytotoxic activity in
AML. Avocatin B reduced human primary AML cell viability
without effect on normal peripheral blood stem cells. Functional
stem cell assays demonstrated selectivity toward AML progenitor
and stem cells without effects on normal hematopoietic stem
cells. Mechanistic investigations indicated that cytotoxicity relied

on mitochondrial localization, as cells lacking functional mitochondria or CPT1, the enzyme that facilitates mitochondria lipid
transport, were insensitive to avocatin B. Furthermore, avocatin B
inhibited fatty acid oxidation and decreased NADPH levels,
resulting in ROS-dependent leukemia cell death characterized by
the release of mitochondrial proteins, apoptosis-inducing factor,
and cytochrome c. This study reveals a novel strategy for selective
leukemia cell eradication based on a speciﬁc difference in mitochondrial function. Cancer Res; 75(12); 2478–88. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

strategies that target both the bulk and LSC populations are needed
to improve AML patient outcomes.
To identify novel AML therapeutics, we screened a natural
health product library (n ¼ 800) for compounds that induce
death of TEX leukemia cells, an AML cell line with features of
LSCs (1, 5, 6). From this screen, we identiﬁed avocatin B, a lipidderived from avocados, as a novel anti-AML compound.

Leukemia and leukemia stem cells (LSC) possess several mitochondrial features that distinguish them from normal hematopoietic cells. Compared with normal cells, leukemia cells contain
greater mitochondrial mass, have higher rates of oxidative phosphorylation (1), and depend on fatty acid oxidation for survival
(2). Together, these altered mitochondrial characteristics may
make drugs that target mitochondria potentially useful for the
eradication of leukemia cells.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating disease
characterized by the accumulation of malignant myeloid precursors that fail to terminally differentiate (3). Patients diagnosed with AML are faced with poor disease prognosis. In adults
(>65), 2-year survival rates are less than 10% (4). The suboptimal
quality of current therapy is, in part, attributed to the inability of
current drugs to target and eliminate LSCs. Thus, new therapeutic

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Leukemia (OCI-AML2) cells were cultured in Iscove's Modiﬁed
Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM; Life Technologies) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Seradigm) and antibiotics
(100 U/mL of streptomycin and 100 mg/mL of penicillin; Sigma
Chemical). TEX leukemia cells were cultured in 15% FBS, antibiotics, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Sigma Chemical), 20 ng/mL stem
cell factor and 2 ng/mL IL3 (Peprotech). Primary human samples
(fresh and frozen) were obtained from the peripheral blood of
AML patients who had at least 80% malignant cells among the
mononuclear cells and cultured at 37 C in IMDM, 20% FBS, and
antibiotics (see Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 for clinical
parameters). Normal G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from volunteers donating peripheral
blood stem cells (PBSC) for allotransplant and were cultured
similar to the primary AML samples. The collection and use of
human tissue for this study was approved by the local ethics
review board (University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada;
University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada).
Cell growth and viability
Cell growth and viability was measured using the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) reduction assay

(Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol and as
previously described (7). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates,
treated with drug for 72 hours, and optical density (OD) was
measured at 490 nm. Cell viability was also assessed by the
Trypan blue exclusion assay and by Annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI) staining (Biovision), as previously described (7).
Functional stem cell assays
Clonogenic growth assays with primary AML and normal
hematopoietic stem cells were performed, as previously described
(7). Brieﬂy, CD34þ bone marrow–derived normal stem cells
(STEMCELL Technologies) or AML mononuclear cells from
patients with >80% blasts in their peripheral blood (4  105
cells/mL) were treated with vehicle control or increasing concentrations of avocatin B and plated in duplicate by volume at 105
cells/mL per 35-mm dish (Nunclon) in MethoCult GF H4434
medium (STEMCELL Technologies) containing 1% methylcellulose in IMDM, 30% FBS, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 3 U/mL
recombinant human erythropoietin, 104 mol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 ng/mL recombinant human
stem cell factor, 10 ng/mL recombinant human granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and 10 ng/mL recombinant
human IL3. After 7 to 10 days of incubation at 37 C with 5%
CO2 and 95% humidity, the number of colonies were counted on
an inverted microscope with a cluster of 10 or more cells counted as
one leukemic colony and 50 or more cells counted as a normal
colony similar to previously described methods (1, 8).
Mouse xenotransplant assays were performed as previously
described (1, 9). Brieﬂy, AML patient cells were treated with 3
mmol/L avocatin B or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; as a control)
for 48 hours in vitro. Next, these cells were transplanted into
femurs of sublethally irradiated, CD122-treated NOD/SCID
mice and following a 6-week engraftment period, mice were
sacriﬁced, femurs excised, bone marrow ﬂushed, and the presence of human myeloid cells (CD45þ/CD33þ/CD19) was
detected by ﬂow cytometry. All animal studies were carried out
according to the regulations of the Canadian Council on Animal
Care and with the approval of the University Health Network,
Animal Care Committee.
High-throughput screen
A high-throughput screen of a natural product library (n ¼ 800;
Microsource Discovery Systems Inc.) was performed as previously
described (1, 7). Brieﬂy, TEX leukemia cells (1.5  104/well) were
seeded in 96-well polystyrene tissue culture plates. After seeding,
cells were treated with aliquots (10 mmol/L ﬁnal concentration) of
the chemical library with a ﬁnal DMSO concentration no greater
than 0.05%. After 72 hours, cell proliferation and viability were
measured by the MTS assay.
Protein and mRNA detection
Western blotting was performed as previously described (10).
Brieﬂy, whole-cell lysates were prepared from treated cells, heated
for 5 minutes at 95 C, and subjected to gel electrophoresis on
7.5% to 15% SDS-PAGE at 150 V for 85 minutes. The samples
were then transferred at 25 V for 45 minutes to a polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane and blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered
saline-tween (TBS-T) for 1 hour. The membrane was incubated
overnight at 4 C with the primary antibody, poly(ADP) ribose
polymerase (PARP)a (1:1,500; Cell Signaling Technology), ANT
(1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ND1 (1:10,000; Santa Cruz

www.aacrjournals.org

Biotechnology), or a-tubulin (loading control; 1:5,000; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were then washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1
hour at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
was used to detect proteins according to the manufacturer's
instructions (GE Healthcare) and luminescence was captured
using the Kodak Image Station 4000MM Pro and analyzed with
a Kodak Molecular Imaging Software Version 5.0.1.27.
Quantitative PCR was performed as previously described (6) in
triplicate using an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems) with 5 ng of RNA equivalent cDNA, SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 400 nmol/L of CPT1speciﬁc primers (forward: 50 -TCGTCACCTCTTCTGCCTTT-30 ,
reverse: 50 -ACACACCATAGCCGTCATCA-30 ). Relative mRNA
expression was determined using the DDCT method as previously
described (6).
Assessment of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial
respiration
Measurement of oxygen consumption rates (OCR) was performed using a Seahorse XF24 extracellular ﬂux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). TEX cells were cultured in a-minimum essential medium (Life Technologies) containing 1% FBS and plated at
1  105 cells per well in poly-L-lysine (Sigma Chemical)–coated
XF24 plates. Cells were incubated with etomoxir (100 mmol/L;
Sigma Chemical) or vehicle control for 30 minutes at 37 C in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Next, palmitate (175
mmol/L; Seahorse Bioscience) or avocatin B (10 mmol/L) was
added and immediately transferred to the XF24 analyzer. Oxidation of exogenous fatty acids was determined by measuring
mitochondrial respiration through sequential injection of 5
mmol/L (ﬁnal concentration) oligomycin, an ATP synthase inhibitor (Millipore), 5 mmol/L CCCP, a hydrogen ion ionophore
(Sigma Chemical), and 5 mmol/L rotenone (Millipore)/5
mmol/L antimycin A, which inhibit complex III activity (Sigma
Chemical). Fatty acid oxidation was determined by the change in
oxygen consumption following oligomycin and CCCP treatment
and prior to antimycin and rotenone treatment, according to the
manufacturer's protocol and as described by Abe and colleagues
(11). Data were analyzed with XF software (Seahorse Bioscience).
ROS, NADH, NADPH, and GSH detection
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected using 20 ,70 dichlorohydroﬂuorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA; Sigma Chemical)
and dihyodroethidium (DHE; Sigma Chemical). DCFH-DA is
hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase to produce a nonﬂuorescent
DCFH product. It can then be oxidized by ROS and other
oxidizing species to produce a highly ﬂuorescent DCF product
(12). DHE is a superoxide indicator that, upon contact with
superoxide anions, produces the ﬂuorescent product 2-hydroxyethidium (13). Following drug treatment, TEX cells (5  105) were
collected and washed in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were stained
with 5 mmol/L (ﬁnal concentration) DCFH-DA or 10 mmol/L DHE
and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 C. Samples were then washed
in PBS and ROS were measured by ﬂow cytometry using the Guava
EasyCyte 8HT (Millipore). Data were analyzed with GuavaSoft
2.5 software (Millipore).
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and glutathione (GSH)
were measured by commercially available ﬂuorimetric kits (AAT

Bioquest), according to the manufacturers' protocol, following
incubation of increasing duration with avocatin B (10 mmol/L).
For NADPH studies, cells were also incubated with palmitate (175
mmol/L) in the presence or absence of etomoxir (100 mmol/L). For
NADH and GSH studies, cells were incubated in the presence of
palmitate and N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 1 mmol/L), respectively.
Data are presented as a percent NAD, NADPH, or GSH compared
with control-treated cells  SD.
Liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy
Avocatin B's presence in mitochondria and cytosolic fractions was detected using thin ﬁlm solid-phase microextraction
(TF-SPME; Professional Analytical System Technology) followed
by liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry
analysis (LC/MS; Thermo Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer; Thermo Scientiﬁc; refs. 14, 15). TEX cells were treated
with avocatin B or a vehicle control for 1 hour, as performed for
the Seahorse Bioanalyzer experiments (i.e., assessment of fatty
acid oxidation), and cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were
then isolated, as previously described (16). Fraction purity was
determined by Western blot analysis for the mitochondrial-speciﬁc protein ND1 (i.e., complex 1). Next, samples were prepared
by TF-SPME and then subjected to LC/MS analysis. For detailed
methods on sample preparation, standardization, and calibration, please refer to the Supplementary Methods.
Apoptosis determination
Caspase activation, PARP cleavage, Annexin V/PI, and DNA
fragmentation assays were performed, as previously described
(10). Release of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins cytochrome
c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were assessed using a ﬂow
cytometry–based assay, as previously described (17, 18) and these
assays are further detailed in the Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise stated, the results are presented as mean  SD.
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software). P  0.05 was accepted as being statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
A high-throughput screen for novel anti-AML compounds
identiﬁes avocatin B
To identify novel compounds with anti-AML activity, we
screened a commercially available natural health products–speciﬁc library against TEX leukemia cells. These cells possess several
LSC properties, such as marrow repopulation and self-renewal
(1, 5, 6, 19). The compound that imparted the greatest reduction
in viability was avocatin B (Fig. 1A; arrow indicates avocatin B).
Avocatin B is a 1:1 mixture of two 17-carbon lipids derived from
avocados and belongs to a family of structurally related lipids (Fig.
1A insert: avocatin B's structure; refs. 20, 21). We tested four
avocatin lipid analogues and determined that avocatin B was the
most cytotoxic (EC50: 1.5  0.75 mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S1
and Table S1).
Avocatin B's selectivity toward leukemia cells was validated in
primary AML samples and in PBSCs isolated from G-CSF–stimulated healthy donors. Avocatin B, at concentrations as high as 20
mmol/L, had no effect on the viability of normal PBSCs (n ¼ 4). In
contrast, avocatin B reduced the viability of primary AML patient

2480 Cancer Res; 75(12) June 15, 2015

cells (n ¼ 6) with an EC50 of 3.9  2.5 mmol/L, which is similar
to other recently identiﬁed compounds with anti-AML activity
(Fig. 1B; see Supplementary Table S2 for patient sample characteristics; refs. 1, 8, 9, 22).
Avocatin B is selectively toxic toward leukemia progenitor and
stem cells
Given the selectivity toward AML patient samples over normal
hematopoietic cells, we next assessed avocatin B's effects on
functionally deﬁned subsets of primitive human AML and normal
cell populations. Adding avocatin B (3 mmol/L) into the culture
medium reduced clonogenic growth of AML patient cells (n ¼
3; Supplementary Table S3 for patient characteristics). In contrast, there was no effect on normal cells (n ¼ 3; Fig. 1C, left). In
addition, treatment of primary AML cells with avocatin B
(3 mmol/L) reduced their ability to engraft in the marrow of
immune-deﬁcient mice (Fig. 1C, right). Taken together, avocatin
B selectively targets primitive leukemia cells.
Avocatin B induces mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
We next assessed the mode of avocatin B–induced leukemia
cell death. Externalization of phosphatidylserine, an early
marker of apoptosis detected by Annexin V, was observed by
ﬂow cytometry in live cells (i.e., Annexin Vþ/PI) treated with
avocatin B (Fig. 2A; F3,7 ¼ 19.09; P < 0.05; see Supplementary
Fig. S2 for raw data). This coincided with the occurrence of
DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2B; F4,14 ¼ 171.4; P < 0.001), caspase
activation (Fig. 2C; F3,16 ¼ 69.56; P < 0.001), and PARP
cleavage (Fig. 2D), as measured by cell-cycle analysis (see
Supplementary Fig. S3 for raw data), a caspase activation assay,
and Western blotting, respectively.
To test whether death was dependent on caspase enzymes, we
coincubated avocatin B with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK or the caspase-3–speciﬁc inhibitor QVD-OPh for 72 hours.
Both inhibitors only slightly protected cells from avocatin B–induced death (F4,9 ¼ 2.714; P < 0.01; Fig. 2E). Because cell death
can occur independent of caspase enzymes through the release of
mitochondria-localized proteins, such as AIF, we tested for the
presence of AIF in cytosolic fractions of avocatin B–treated TEX
cells. However, given that AIF release involves mitochondrial
outer membrane permeability and that we detected caspase
activation, we also simultaneously tested for the presence of
cytochrome c, which activates caspase enzymes following its
release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Cells treated with avocatin B showed an increase in cytoplasmic concentrations of AIF (Fig. 2F; F4,20 ¼ 8.211; P < 0.001) and cytochrome c
(Fig. 2F; F4,20 ¼ 13.57; P < 0.001). Therefore, avocatin B–induced
apoptotic death is characterized by the release of the mitochondrial proteins AIF and cytochrome c; however, AIF is likely the
key mediator, as death occurred in the presence of caspase inhibitors. Future studies would be needed to conﬁrm the functional
importance of AIF in avocatin B–induced death.
Avocatin B inhibits fatty acid oxidation
Apoptosis was characterized by the release of mitochondrial
proteins following avocatin B treatment. Because avocatin B contains 17-carbon lipids and lipids of that size can enter the mitochondria and undergo fatty acid oxidation after they have been
processed by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), we evaluated
the impact of avocatin B on fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acid oxidation produces acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle to produce

NADH, which fuels oxidative phosphorylation, and NADPH,
which is an important cofactor that participates in catabolic processes during cell proliferation (23) and can also regenerate the
oxidized form of GSH (e.g., GSSG) to produce reduced GSH—an
important intracellular and mitochondrial antioxidant (Fig. 3A;
refs. 24, 25). To test the effects of avocatin B on fatty acid oxidation,
we measured mitochondrial bioenergetics of TEX cells preincubated with avocatin B or palmitate in the absence or presence of
etomoxir by measuring the change in maximum oxygen consumption following oligomycin and CCCP treatment and prior to the
addition of antimycin and rotenone, as previously described (11).
As expected, treatment with palmitate increased the OCR, consistent with oxidation of exogenous fatty acid substrates and this
increase was blocked by treatment with etomoxir, a CPT1 inhibitor
(Fig. 3B and C). Similarly, avocatin B reduced palmitate oxidation,
demonstrating that avocatin B inhibits the oxidation of exogenous
fatty acids (Fig. 3B and C; F5,17 ¼ 40.83; P < 0.05; arrows indicate
when oligomycin, CCCP, and antimycin/rotenone were added).
Future studies are needed to further determine the nature of CPT1's
preference for avocatin B over palmitate.
Inhibiting fatty acid oxidation results in reduced NAD, NADPH,
and GSH and elevated ROS
Inhibiting fatty acid oxidation can decrease NAD, NADPH, and
GSH and subsequently decrease antioxidant capabilities (26).
Thus, we tested the effect of avocatin B on NAD, NADPH,

www.aacrjournals.org

and GSH levels in leukemia cells. Avocatin B (10 mmol/L), similar
to etomoxir (100 mmol/L), decreased NADPH, an effect that
occurred even in the presence of palmitate (175 mmol/L; Fig. 4A;
F9,19 ¼ 5.129; P < 0.05). Similarly, avocatin B decreased
NADH and GSH (Fig. 3D: NAD: F3,11 ¼ 5.145; P <
0.05; Fig. 4B: GSH: F4,14 ¼ 188.9; P < 0.001).
Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation can reduce NADPH and GSH,
leading to reduced antioxidant capacity, elevated ROS, and cell
death (26). ROS levels were tested in avocatin B–treated cells
using DCFH-DA and DHE, which measure general oxidizing
species such as ROS and superoxide, respectively. TEX or primary
AML cells treated with avocatin B had a time-dependent increase
in ROS levels as measured by DCFH-DA (Fig. 4C, left; F5,11 ¼
176.7; P < 0.01; see Supplementary Fig. S4 for histogram data) and
DHE (F5,11 ¼ 36.75; P < 0.01; Fig. 4C; see Supplementary Fig. S4
for histogram data). To test the importance of ROS in avocatin B–
induced death, we coincubated cells with NAC and a-tocopherol
(a-Toc). NAC can neutralize a number of oxidizing species,
including ROS directly or indirectly through antioxidant regeneration [i.e., convert oxidized GSH (i.e., GSSG) to reduced GSH;
GSH is decreased following NADPH depletion; ref. 26] and a-Toc
is a lipid-based antioxidant that accumulates in organelle membranes, particularly mitochondria, to prevent lipid peroxyl radicals formed by ROS-induced membrane damage (27). Coincubation with NAC (Fig. 4D: F3,7 ¼ 70.55, P < 0.05; Fig. 4E: F3,10 ¼
70.55, P < 0.05) or a-Toc (Fig. 4D; F3,7 ¼ 10.23; P < 0.05)

abolished avocatin B–induced death. Daunorubicin was used as a
negative control, as antioxidants do not protect against its cytotoxicity (28, 29). Finally, we coincubated cells with polyethylene
glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), an antioxidant that
reduces cellular concentrations of the superoxide anion. Coincubation with PEG-SOD similarly reduced ROS and blockedavocatin B's activity (Supplementary Fig. S5). Together, these
results demonstrate that avocatin B decreased levels of NAD,
NADPH, and GSH and that ROS is functionally important for
avocatin B's activity.
Mitochondria and CPT1 are functionally important for avocatin
B-induced death
We demonstrated that avocatin B inhibits fatty acid oxidation
and induces apoptosis characterized by the release of mitochondrial proteins cytochrome c and AIF. Because avocatin B is a lipid
and leukemia cells possess mitochondrial and metabolic alterations that result in their dependence on fatty acid substrates for
survival (2), we hypothesized that avocatin B's toxicity was related
to its localization in mitochondria. To ﬁrst test avocatin B's
reliance on mitochondria for cytotoxicity, we generated leukemia
cells lacking functional mitochondria by culturing Jurkat-T cells in
media supplemented with 50 ng/mL of ethidium bromide, 100
mg/mL sodium pyruvate, and 50 mg/mL uridine, as previously
described (30, 31). Following 60 days of passaging only live cells,
the presence of mitochondria were tested by ﬂow cytometry

following 10-nonyl acridine orange (NAO) staining and by Western blotting for mitochondrial speciﬁc proteins ND1 and adenine
nucleotide translocator (ANT). The signiﬁcant reduction of mitochondria was conﬁrmed, as cells cocultured in ethidium bromide
containing media demonstrated a drastic reduction in NAO
staining (Supplementary Fig. S6), absence of mitochondrial respiration (Supplementary Fig. S6), and a near absence of ND1 and
ANT (Fig. 5A). Avocatin B's toxicity was abolished in cells lacking
functional mitochondria (i.e., JURK-Rho(0) cells), as measured
by the Annexin V/PI assay (Fig. 5B; F2,12 ¼ 6.509; P < 0.001).
Highlighting the utility of these cells in assessing mitochondrial
participation in drug activity, we have previously shown that cells
lacking mitochondria were equally sensitive to their mitochondria containing controls when subjected to a compound that
activates mitochondria-independent, calpain-mediated apoptosis (10).
To directly examine whether avocatin B accumulated into
mitochondria, LC/MS was performed on mitochondria and
cytosolic fractions of avocatin B or vehicle control–treated TEX
cells. Fraction purity was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis of
the mitochondria-speciﬁc protein ND1 (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S8). Avocatin B was detected in mitochondrial and
cytosolic fractions of avocatin B–treated TEX cells (Fig. 5D).
Two peaks [with a mass/charge (m/z) ratio of 285.24242 and
287.25807] were detected, which reﬂect the nature of avocatin
B's two-lipid composition. Importantly, retention times (min)

for m/z 285 and 287 were nearly identical between pure
compound and the cellular fractions (pure avocatin B: 4.46
and 4.76; mitochondrial fraction: 4.46 and 4.78; cytosolic
fraction: 4.46 and 4.78). As expected, avocatin B was not found
in vehicle control–treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Lipids of 16 to 20 carbon length enter mitochondria by the
activity of CPT1 (32). To determine the role of CPT1 in avocatin
B–induced death, we blocked CPT1 chemically with etomoxir and
genetically using RNA interference. Etomoxir concentrations that
did not reduce viability (100 mmol/L; Fig. 6A), abrogated avocatin
B–induced cell death (Fig. 6B; F5,17 ¼ 94.45; P < 0.001) and
reductions in clonogenic growth (Fig. 6C; F5,17 ¼ 94.45; P <
0.001). As a genetic approach, we generated cells with reduced
CPT1 gene expression (mRNA: Fig. 6D, left; for protein see ref. 33).
CPT1 knockdown cells were signiﬁcantly less sensitive to avocatin
B (Fig. 6D, middle; F9,32 ¼ 23.73; P < 0.001) and were insensitive
to avocatin B–induced reduction of NADPH (Fig. 6D, right; F3,16
¼ 65.04; P < 0.001). Together, these results show that avocatin B is

a lipid that localizes to the mitochondria and impairs fatty acid
oxidation.

Discussion
A screen of a natural health product library identiﬁed avocatin B as a novel anti-AML agent. In vitro and preclinical
functional studies demonstrated that it induced selective toxicity toward leukemia and LSCs with no toxicity toward normal
cells. Mechanistically, we highlight a novel strategy to induce
selective leukemia cell death, where mitochondrial localization
of avocatin B inhibits fatty acid oxidation and decreases levels
of NADPH, resulting in elevated ROS leading to apoptotic cell
death.
Avocatin B targets leukemia over normal cells. We propose this
speciﬁcity is related to the leukemia cells' altered mitochondrial
characteristics, as a number of observations suggest avocatin B
targets mitochondria. For example, (i) we directly show avocatin B

with signiﬁcantly reduced mitochondria or (iii) lacking the
enzyme that facilitates mitochondrial lipid transport, CPT1, are
insensitive to avocatin B; (iv) chemical treatment with etomoxir, a
CPT1 inhibitor, blocked avocatin B's activity; and (v) CPT1 only
facilitates entry of lipids of avocatin B's size into mitochondria [e.
g., 16–20 carbons (32); avocatin B:17 carbons (21)]. Compared
with normal hematopoietic cells, leukemia cells contain higher
mitochondrial mass (1) and depend on fatty acid substrates for
survival (2). Thus, given this mitochondrial phenotype, we propose that avocatin B accumulates with greater concentration in
leukemia over normal cells, thus conferring its increased toxicity
toward leukemia cells.

Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by avocatin B resulted in ROSinduced apoptosis. Apoptosis was characterized by the mitochondrial proteins cytochrome c and AIF, which are commonly
released following ROS-induced increases in mitochondrial outer
membrane permeability (34, 35). Inhibiting fatty acid oxidation
by blocking CPT1 with etomoxir resulted in ROS-dependent
death of glioma cells caused by reduced concentrations of intracellular antioxidants attributed to decreased NADPH (26). Similarly, we demonstrated that avocatin B–induced inhibition of
fatty acid oxidation decreased NADPH and GSH levels and that
antioxidant supplementation rescued cells from death. NADPH is
used for catabolic processes in proliferating cells and is able to
regenerate cellular antioxidants (i.e., convert oxidized GSH,

Mitochondria are functionally important for avocatin B–induced death. A, Jurkat T cells were cultured in 50 ng/mL of ethidium bromide, 100 mg/mL sodium
pyruvate, and 50 mg/mL uridine for 60 days to create Jurkat-Rho(0) cells, which lack functional mitochondrial. To conﬁrm that Jurkat-Rho(0) cells lack mitochondria,
we measured the mitochondria-speciﬁc markers ANT and complex I (ND1) by Western blotting. B, avocatin B's activity was tested in cells with (JURK)

thioredoxins, and peroxiredoxins to their reduced equivalents),
which counteract the detrimental effects of free radicals, including
ROS; GSH speciﬁcally converts hydrogen peroxide to water
(23, 36). Our observed NADPH decrease (t ¼ 5 hours; Fig. 4A)
preceded ROS elevation (t ¼ 12 hours; Fig. 4C), further conﬁrming the relationship between inhibition of fatty acid oxidation,
NADPH, and ROS-dependent leukemia cell death. Of note, in our
experiments, avocatin B accumulated in mitochondria to inhibit
fatty acid oxidation and reduced NADPH at 10 mmol/L, whereas
other studies used etomoxir, which blocks fatty acid entry into
mitochondria and reduces NADPH at 100 mmol/L (2) or 1,000
mmol/L (26). Together, these results point to a mechanism in
which avocatin B enters the mitochondria and potently inhibits
fatty acid oxidation, resulting in decreased NADPH and GSH
leading to elevated ROS and apoptotic cell death.
Avocatin B is a 1:1 ratio of two 17-carbon lipids derived from
methanol extracted from avocado pear seeds (Persea gratissima;
ref. 20). Odd-numbered carbons are rare, not produced endogenously and obtained only from dietary sources (37, 38). More-

over, they are not efﬁciently or preferentially oxidized. For example, mice fed diets containing radiolabeled odd- and even-numbered fatty acids only accumulate odd-numbered fatty acids in
adipose tissue (i.e., C15 and 17; ref. 39); odd-numbered fatty
acids show consistent adipose accumulation (37, 40, 41). In
humans, lipids of 13, 15, and 17 carbon lengths are used as
serum and adipose tissue biomarkers of dietary fat intake, as these
fatty acids are more slowly catabolized compared with evennumbered fatty acids (38, 42). Although they undergo the same
pathway of oxidation, the terminal step of odd-numbered fatty
acid oxidation produces 1 acetyl-CoA and 1 propionyl-CoA
molecule, whereas even-numbered fatty acids produce 2 acetylCoA molecules (43). Propionyl-CoA can then be converted to
methylmalonyl-CoA by propinyl-CoA carboxylase and vitamin
B12, at the expense of 1 ATP, which, in turn, is converted to
succinyl-CoA that can enter the TCA cycle (41). Because this
alternate pathway requires energy and delays overall ATP production, the decreased metabolic activity (i.e., reduced acetyl-CoA
production and/or decreased entry of fatty acid byproducts into

the TCA cycle) likely explains our observed decrease in NAD and
NADPH. As such, decreased levels of NADPH may not only result
in elevated ROS, but also indicate a decrease in overall metabolic
activity. Thus, a novel pathway by which fatty acid oxidation can
be inhibited in leukemia cells is by the odd-numbered carbon
lipid, avocatin B stalling or rendering less efﬁcient the fatty acid
oxidation pathway. This highlights a novel strategy to induce
selective leukemia cell death by which preferential mitochondrial
localization of avocatin B reduces leukemia cell metabolism and
decreases NADPH, leading to ROS-mediated cell death.
Alternatively, mitochondrial accumulation of fatty acids could
have lipotoxic effects. When in excess, fatty acids can accumulate
inside the mitochondrial matrix where they are deprotonated,
because of the proton gradient, creating fatty acid anions. These
are converted by ROS into lipid peroxides that, in turn, cause
damage to mitochondrial DNA, lipids, and proteins within the
mitochondrial matrix (44). However, the generation of lipotoxic
products requires ROS (45), therefore; avocatin B accumulation
by itself would be insufﬁcient to impart lipotoxicity. Thus, once
inside the mitochondria, avocatin B or avocatin B derivatives may
be converted to lipotoxic byproducts and contribute to death but
only after sufﬁcient ROS production (i.e., following avocatin B–
induced inhibition of fatty acid oxidation). Thus, mitochondrial
accumulation may contribute to death through lipotoxicity but
this is not the underlying mechanism of avocatin B's activity.
Few compounds that inhibit fatty acid oxidation are currently
approved for clinical use (23). CPT1 inhibitors, such as etomoxir
and perhexiline, are associated with hepatoxicity (46) and neurotoxicity (47), respectively, and are not approved for clinical use
in North America. Other inhibitors, such as trimetazidine, which
inhibits 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, an enzyme involved in fatty acid

2486 Cancer Res; 75(12) June 15, 2015

catabolism and ranolazine, which blocks late sodium currents,
have had clinical success for the treatment of angina (48, 49).
None of these compounds are approved for use in AML or other
hematologic malignancies. Future studies are needed to asses
avocatin B's pharmacology and pharmacokinetics; however, initial assessment of avocatin B's physicochemical properties suggests favorable tissue distribution. In particular, it possesses a high
estimated partition coefﬁcient (LogP ¼ 8.9; ref. 21), indicating
that it will accumulate in lipid-rich tissues such as adipose tissue
and bone marrow. Given that LSCs reside in bone marrow, this
could signiﬁcantly enhance avocatin B's therapeutic efﬁcacy.
Nonetheless, future studies are needed to test the pharmacokinetics and safety of avocatin B in human trials.
In conclusion, avocatin B accumulated in mitochondria to
inhibit fatty acid oxidation and decrease NADPH, resulting in
ROS-mediated cell death characterized by the mitochondrial
release of cytochrome c and AIF. Given the observed leukemia
cell speciﬁcity, inhibiting fatty acid oxidation following avocatin B accumulation represents a novel therapeutic strategy
that targets an important cellular pathway involved in leukemia
cell activity.
