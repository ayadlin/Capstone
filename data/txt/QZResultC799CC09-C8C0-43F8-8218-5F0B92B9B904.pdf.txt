ABSTRACT
Wilms tumour (WT) is the most common renal tumour in children. Most WT
patients respond to chemotherapy, but subsets of tumours develop resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents, which is a major obstacle in their successful treatment.
Multidrug resistance transporters play a crucial role in the development of resistance
in cancer due to the efflux of anticancer agents out of cells. The aim of this study was
to explore several human multidrug resistance transporters in 46 WT and 40 nonneoplastic control tissues (normal kidney) from patients selected after chemotherapy
treatment SIOP 93–01, SIOP 2001. Our data showed that the majority of the studied
multidrug resistance transporters were downregulated or unchanged between
tumours and control tissues. However, BCRP1, MDR3 and MRP1 were upregulated in
tumours versus control tissues. MDR3 and MRP1 overexpression correlated with highrisk tumours (SIOP classification) (p = 0.0022 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and the
time of disease-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with high transcript
levels of MDR3 (p = 0.0359). MDR3 and MRP1 play a role in drug resistance in WT
treatment, probably by alteration of an unspecific drug excretion system. Besides,
within the blastemal subtype, we observed patients with low MDR3 expression
were significantly associated with a better outcome than patients with high MDR3
expression. We could define two types of blastemal WT associated with different
disease outcomes, enabling the stratification of blastemal WT patients based on the
expression levels of the multidrug resistance transporter MDR3.

INTRODUCTION

of three cellular components (blastemal, epithelial, and
stromal). Each one of these cellular elements may show
different degrees of differentiation [7].
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and the
International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) are
the two major groups which have great contributions
in the management of WT. Both develop two different
approaches or protocols of the diagnosis and treatment

Wilms tumour (WT), also called nephroblastoma,
is an embryonal malignant neoplasm of the kidney
accounting for 6–7% of all childhood cancers [1–3]. WT is
the most common renal tumour in children before the age
of five years [1, 4–6]. Histologically, the usual appearance
of WT is that of a mixed pattern, with variable proportions

of WT [6, 8–9]. Those two protocols are currently used:
The COG in North America develops a system based in an
upfront surgery (nephrectomy) to accurately assess tumour
stage and histology [3, 10]. In Europe, SIOP delays
nephrectomy 4–6 weeks favoring upfront chemotherapy
and reducing complications of surgery and tumour spillage
[3, 11]. Both collaborative groups have proven valuable
in predicting outcomes and the different approaches of
treatment have shown almost equivalent clinical outcomes
[10, 12–13].
Three risk groups (low, intermediate, and high) were
defined by the SIOP Pathology system (SIOP 93–01, SIOP
2001), based on the percentage of overall necrosis and the
predominant cell type in the residual viable cells [14–15].
Although in most cases of WT such therapy induces a
considerable degree of tumour shrinkage and the overall
survival is greater than 90%, a proportion of cases show
a limited volume reduction and retain an abundance of
blastemal tissue post-chemotherapy. These are stratified
as high-risk blastemal cases and have a poor prognosis
[16]. One of the biggest problems for patients with poor
prognosis is resistance to standard chemotherapy [17].
Patients with blastemal WT represent a chemoresistant
cohort requiring more intensive adjuvant treatment [18].
Several mechanisms have been described that could
contribute to chemoresistance: Nonspecific expulsion
of drugs out of the cell is probably the best studied
resistance mechanism and mainly related to the action
of certain proteins [19–20]. These proteins are present
in many normal tissues of the human body as well as
in tumours. The fact that many of these have secretoryexcretory tissue functions (kidney, liver, gastrointestinal
epithelium and respiratory epithelium) suggests that
multidrug resistance proteins could play the physiological
function of protection against exogenous toxins [21–23].
Over the years, a number of genes have been identified as
being involved in multidrug resistance but the molecular
mechanisms of drug resistance in WT remain poorly
understood. The multidrug resistance transporters are
classified into two groups: A) Proteins belonging to the
family of transporters known as ABC transporters (ATPbinding cassette), which are located in the cell membrane.
Members of this family are involved in the active transport
of many molecules through the cell membrane. Some of
the main members are P-glycoprotein (PGP), multidrug
resistance-associated protein (MRP) and breast cancer
resistance protein (BCRP), which act as “efflux pump”
decreasing the intracellular accumulation of different
substances, including many cytostatic drugs [24–25]. B)
Non-ABC transporters such as related protein in lung
resistance (LRP) or Major Vault Protein (MVP): Vault
human complex comprises the vault higher molecular
weight protein (MVP) and two minor vault proteins
(VPARP and TEP1), plus untranslated RNA molecules.
Vault proteins are found in the cytoplasm, probably

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

associated with cytoplasmic vesicles, and a small part in
the nuclear membrane, particularly in the nuclear pore
complex [26–28].
The role of multidrug resistance transporters in WT
is not well characterized. Since 1997, few studies have
addressed the expression of multidrug resistance transporters
in this prevalent tumour. These manuscripts provided data
on the main transporters but did not provide a complete
expression profile. Moreover, the studies showed a reduced
number of cases, a lack of suitable statistical analysis and
contradictory results [26, 29–33]. It is important to elucidate
the role of multidrug resistance transports in WT as they
may form the basis of one of the possible reasons for a WT
patient’s treatment failure. The aim of the present study was
to analyze the expression profiling of multidrug resistance
transporters in frozen and in paraffin-embedded samples
from WT patients and correlate these results with different
clinicopathological parameters.

RESULTS
Differences in the gene expression profile of
multidrug resistance genes between control
kidneys and Wilms tumour samples
To determine the role of multidrug resistance
transporters in WT, we performed gene expression profiling
of nine multidrug resistance transporters in WT frozen
samples (Series 1). Previous to qRT-PCR analysis, we
assessed the best endogenous gene by geNorm v3 software
and evaluated the most stable reference genes from a set of
tested genes in a given cDNA sample panel (kidney and
WT samples). A gene expression normalization factor was
calculated for each tissue sample based on the geometric
mean of a user-defined number of reference genes: B2M,
GAPDH, HRPT1 and TPT1. The best gene for expression
normalization was TPT1. Then, through qRT-PCR, levels
of mRNAs encoding transporters in WT were compared
to those of normal kidneys. We found that expression
of BCRP1 (breast cancer resistance protein), MDR3
(Multidrug resistance 3) and MRP1 (Multidrug resistanceassociated protein 1) were significantly higher in WT
patient samples than in control samples. We also observed a
significantly lower expression of MRP2, MRP3 (Multidrug
resistance-associated protein 2 and 3) and MVP1 in WT
than in control samples (Figure 1A). Next, we analyzed
the mRNA levels of these genes in paired samples (n = 40)
and compared its expression between normal kidney
and WT (Figure 1B). We observed the same expression
pattern as for the non-paired samples. However, we did
not find any differences in the minor vault genes (vPARP
and TEP1) in any of the analyses done. Therefore, in WT
samples we observed a differential expression pattern in
the transporter genes BCRP1, MDR3 and MRP1, which
could confer resistance to chemotherapy treatment.

MRP1 expression than normal kidneys and intermediaterisk tumours (Figure 2C). Therefore, MDR3 and MRP1
transcript and protein levels were increased in high-risk
tumours. We were interested to evaluate whether the
expression of these two multidrug resistance transporters
was correlated. Our results show that in normal tissue
samples there was no correlation in expression between
the two genes, but in WT samples there was a positive
correlation (Figure  2D). So, MDR3 and MRP1 were
increased in high-risk tumours, particularly in blastemal
tumours, and there was a positive correlation between
them. This result indicates that the multidrug resistance
transporters MDR3 and MRP1 could be determinant of
treatment resistance of malignant WT patients.

The determined pattern of gene expression provides
information on which transporter genes have increased
expression in WT (and may confer the tumour more
resistance to treatment) and those that have a decreased
expression (the tumour would be more sensitive to
treatment). Consequently, we compared the tumour
expression of multidrug resistance transporter genes with
WT clinicopathological characteristics. We analyzed the
risk (low, intermediate and high), stage (I to IV), and
tumoural subtype (blastemal, epithelial and stromal) of 46
WT samples (Series 1). We observed that only MDR3 and
MRP1 overexpression showed a significant relationship
with clinicopathological parameters. The other multidrug
resistance transporters in the series did not correlate with
those parameters (data not shown). Surprisingly, MDR3
and MRP1 expression showed a significant increase in
high-risk tumours compared with low or intermediate
risk. Also, we appreciated a progressive increase in MDR3
expression as the degree of risk was increased (Figure 2A).
On the other hand, blastemal tumours showed a stronger
expression in MDR3 and MRP1 than epithelial or stromal
WT (Figure 2B). Subsequently, we checked whether we
could detect the same differences in MDR3 and MRP1
protein levels between kidney and tumour samples and
between high and intermediate risk WT samples. We
extracted protein from 5 kidneys and 13 WT frozen samples
and analyzed the expression by western blot (Series 1). We
observed that high-risk WT samples had more MDR3 and

A total of 31 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
FFPE samples (Series 2) were analyzed using
immunohistochemical detection with selected antibodies.
We analyzed the presence/absence of MDR3 and MRP1
expression in WT. Similar to the analysis of mRNA levels
and in total protein extracts (Figures 1 and 2), we observed
a differential expression between kidneys and WT as well
as between intermediate- and high-risk tumours. All of
the normal kidney samples either expressed weakly or
were negative for MDR3, while MRP1 expression was
weak to moderate. The high-risk WT samples had higher
expression than normal kidney or intermediate-risk
WT samples (Figure 3A). Besides an evaluation of the

levels of expression, the use of immunohistochemistry
allowed us to distinguish the subcellular localization of
the two multidrug resistance transporters. We observed
plasma membrane and cytoplasmic expression for both
transporters. By Fisher´s exact test we confirmed a
statistically significant difference in expression in highrisk expression tumours. There was MDR3 expression in
71.43% of high-risk tumours compared with only 20.83%
of intermediate-risk tumours. Likewise, MPR1 expression
in high-risk tumours was 85.72% with respect to 29.17%
in intermediate-risk tumours (Figure 3B). These significant
differences confirm the relevance of MDR3 and MRP1 in
high-risk WT.

results confirm that our series represents what has been
previously described in other published studies. Blastemal
predominant and high-risk WT is more aggressive than
other subtypes and has a poor outcome [16–17]. Next, we
analyzed disease-free survival versus MDR3 and MRP1
transcript expression. We used a median cut off because it
is more representative and less biased. Our results showed
that WT patients with high transcript levels of MDR3 had
a significantly poorer prognosis than WT patients with low
mRNA levels (Figure 4C). We performed an analogous
analysis with MRP1 but it did not show any statistical
differences between expression levels (Figure 4D). In
conclusion, MDR3 and MPR1 overexpression could be
important biomarkers in high-risk WT but only the high
expression of MDR3 confers poor prognosis in treated
patients.

High expression of MDR3 correlated with
reduced disease-free survival in WT patients

The level of MDR3 expression can be used to
stratify the Wilms tumour blastemal subtype

According to our data, MDR3 and MRP1 were more
highly expressed in high-risk and in blastemal subtype
WT. The next step was to correlate these results with
the clinical parameters of patients (Series 1). Previous to
this analysis, we confirmed that our patient sample series
was representative. We analyzed by Kaplan-Meier the
relation between disease-free survival (a clinical prognosis
marker) with tumour subtype and risk. We confirmed that
patients with blastemal subtype or with high-risk tumours
had a reduced disease-free survival (Figure 4A and 4B)
and were significantly more likely to relapse. These

The WT subtype with the worse clinical outcome
is blastemal predominant. Applying the same cut off as
in Figure 4C–4D, the number of blastemal WT samples
in Series 1 with low or high expression levels of MDR3
was 5 and 6 respectively, with similar numbers for MRP1
expression (Figure 5A). From the Series 1 samples we
obtained a positive and significant correlation between
MDR3 and MRP1 transcript expression in blastemal

tumour samples only (Figure 5B). Similar to the
correlation previously identified in Figure 2D for all
samples, blastemal WT with high MDR3 expression also
showed high levels of MRP1.
Surprisingly, we found blastemal WT samples
with both high and low expression of MDR3 and MRP1.
Therefore, we were interested to examine whether the
differences in expression had any clinical relevance.
We analyzed by Kaplan-Meier the relation between
disease-free survival and transcript expression levels.
We observed that patients with high MDR3 expression
showed a higher relapse rate than patients with low MDR3
expression (p = 0.0328). In fact, the subgroup with low
expression did not relapse (Figure 5C). However, we
could not confirm the relation between the progression of
patients with blastemal predominant tumours and MRP1
expression levels statistically due to the small sample size
(Figure 5D). To confirm MDR3 and MRP1 as possible
clinical markers for blastemal subtype stratification,
further to the analysis of gene expression by qRT-PCR, we
checked whether we could stratify WT subtype cases by
the level of IHC labeling. There were only four blastemal

cases in our TMA (Series 2) thus we were unable to do a
statistical comparison. Nevertheless, we confirmed by IHC
that there were different MDR3 and MRP1 expression
levels in blastemal WT samples. We identified two types
of blastemal WT, i) those with low MDR3 and MRP1
expression, and ii) those with high expression of both
proteins (Figure 5E).

DISCUSSION
Predicting the clinical behavior and prognosis of
Wilms tumours can be difficult. Currently, the prediction
of treatment outcome – whether the WT patient will
respond to chemotherapy or not – is mainly based on the
histopathology and stage of disease at the time of resection
[34]. The aim of this study was to identify novel molecular
prognostic markers by characterization of the expression
profiles of multidrug resistant genes in WT samples.
The role of multidrug resistant transport-associated
proteins in chemotherapy-acquired drug resistance and
its correlation with the evolution of the disease has not
been fully investigated for WT. Our results showed a

differential expression pattern of specific multidrug
resistance genes after the treatment of WT patients. The
majority of multidrug resistance transporters studied
was downregulated or unchanged between tumours and
control tissues. However BCRP1, MDR3 and MRP1
were upregulated in tumours versus control tissues.
Among the multidrug resistant transporters studied,
only MDR3 and MRP1 showed a significant correlation
with clinicopathological parameters. Specifically, our
retrospective results showed an increase in high-risk
and blastemal predominant subtype tumours associated
with MDR3 and MRP1 expression. There was a positive
correlation between MDR3 and MRP1 expression in
tumours but not in normal kidney. We suppose that the
increased expression of the two transporters would confer
more resistance to treatment in WT, as has recently been
demonstrated in ovarian cancer and in several different
cancer cell lines [35–36].
Confirming our data, many studies have highlighted
the importance of MDR3 or MRP1 in malignant disease.
A study of chronic lymphocytic leukemia reported
the increased expression of MDR3 in patients with
advanced disease in comparison to early stages [37–38].
Furthermore, in pediatric soft tissue sarcomas after
chemotherapy, an increase in MDR3 gene expression
was described as well as in cholangiocarcinoma and
cirrhosis [39]. For MRP1, high levels of the gene were

associated with poor prognosis and high histological
grade in childhood neuroblastoma [40–42], soft tissue
sarcoma [43], and non-small cell lung cancer [44–46],
and with recurrence in breast cancer patients who were
treated with chemotherapy [47]. To our knowledge, only
one previously reported study suggested the existence
of a common expressing regulatory mechanism between
MDR3 and MRP1 in high-risk tumours such as breast
cancers and nephroblastoma [48].
Although MDR3 and MRP1 were overexpressed in
high-risk WT and we found a positive correlation between
them, only MDR3 expression was negatively correlated
with disease-free survival. In colorectal cancer, the disease
free interval of patients treated by adjuvant chemotherapy
was significantly shorter in patients with low transcript
levels of MDR3 [49]. In addition, the overall survival of
liver cancer patients tended to be longer in those patients
with high MDR3 and MRP1 expression compared to
the control group [50]. Our results did not show any
relation between MRP1 and disease-free survival, but
other studies demonstrated an association with patient
survival in nephroblastoma [29] and with shorter time of
disease progression in breast cancer [51]. The discrepancy
in results obtained in different tumours may be due to
different factors such as epigenetics, microenvironment,
or compensation between different multidrug resistance
proteins and altered tumour homeostasis versus healthy

organs by inhibiting or overexpressing different multidrug
resistance genes.
Predicting the clinical response of WT patients to
chemotherapy treatment with current clinical tools can
be difficult; therefore, there is a real need to identify
molecular prognostic markers. The blastemal subtype
of nephroblastoma after pre-operative chemotherapy
is strongly associated with adverse outcome [52]. Our
results showed that MDR3 could be a prognostic marker
in blastemal and high-risk WT. Surprisingly, we observed
two different blastemal WT patients defined by MDR3
and MRP1 expression, and relapse was associated with
high MDR3 expression in blastemal WT. Results in MRP1
showed the same behavior but the number of samples
was not high enough to reach statistical significance.
Nevertheless, we observed a positive correlation between
MDR3 and MRP1 in blastemal WT, stratifying blastemal
WT into two groups with different clinical outcomes and
confirming the importance of the multidrug resistance
transports in blastemal WT. In accordance with our data,
Barroca suggested that two types of blastema may occur
in WT and that each of these types exhibit different
chemotherapeutic sensitivities, proliferative properties,
and abilities to undergo apoptosis or necrosis [53]. To date,
the molecular effects of therapy on WT and the factors
that produce chemoresistance in this tumour are not well
understood. The identification of new prognostic/response
factors for WT would enable the stratification of patients
for optimal clinical strategy. Therefore, biomarkers like
MDR3 could provide oncologists with a novel tool to
identify patients with a high risk of recurrence in order to
apply an appropriate therapy.
For an effective treatment design for WT patients, the
role of multidrug resistance proteins must be considered.
The role of transporters has been described as inducers
of chemoresistance in several studies. In paclitaxel-,
doxorubicin- and vincristine-resistant cell lines (colon
and ovarian cancer cell lines), an increased expression of
several drug resistance genes was identified [35]. Also,
in meduloblastoma cell lines, the inhibition of ABC
transporters (MDR3 and others) increased the efficacy of
radiation therapy [54]. Resistance to chemotherapy may be
due to high expression of multidrug resistance mechanisms
already present in tumor cells before treatment, and/or it is
also possible that chemotherapy modulates the expression
of multidrug resistance proteins reducing treatment
efficacy. Several studies showing that expression of MRP1
and MDR3, among others multidrug resistance genes may
induce or increase after chemotherapy in pediatric tumors,
soft tissue sarcomas and malignant melanoma [33, 48, 55].
In the SIOP-93-01 protocol, vincristine and actinomycin
D treatment were given to the patient with localized
tumor, and doxorubicin was included in patients with
metastatic disease. It was known that MDR3 and MRP1
confer resistance to a variety of drugs like vincristine,
actinomycin D and doxorubicin [30, 56–58]. In addition
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

among these drugs, only, vincristine had been described
as a MRP1 substrate [25, 59]. Our results suggested that
the increased of MDR3 and MRP1 expression in high
risk and blastemal WT conferred resistance to first line
WT chemotherapy treatment. We hypothesize that this
tumors had more active the efflux pumps and decreased
the intracellular accumulation of this drugs due to the high
expression of MDR3 and MPR1.
It will be interesting to explore the inhibition of
transporters as an adjuvant treatment to the standard
treatment of WT patients. Several studies have
demonstrated that inhibition of multidrug resistance
proteins improves the results of treatment-resistant
tumours. For example, ovarian cancer cells inhibited
by siRNA against MDR3 showed reversed resistance
to paclitaxel [54, 60]. In neuroblastoma cells, an MRP1
inhibitor increased reversal of the therapeutic index of
chemotherapy in mouse models [61]. Currently, several
drugs associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI),
such as chlorpromazine, imipramine, itraconazole
and haloperidol, are being tested as MDR3 inhibitors.
However, these inhibitors are associated with undesirable
side effects like liver damage [62]. The development of
more specific peptidomimetic inhibitors, glutathioneconjugate analogs (MRP1 inhibitor), could prevent these
adverse outcomes [63].
In summary, our findings suggest that MDR3 and
MRP1 could have an important role in drug resistance
in WT treatment. In addition, we have described a
possible new biomarker for stratification of the WT
blastemal subtype. We demonstrated that low expression
of MDR3 in the blastemal subtype is associated with a
good prognosis in this high-risk tumour. In the future, it
will be interesting to perform prospective studies with
larger number of samples to confirm MDR3 expression
as a clinical biomarker for WT prognosis and treatment
outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and clinical samples
This retrospective study included two different
sample series obtained between 1993 and 2006. Series
1 comprised 46 frozen tumors with 40 normal kidneys (no
tumoral kidneys). In 40 cases, normal kidney and tumor
paired samples could be obtained. From 6 patients there
was only tumoral tissue without normal kidney available.
Series 2 comprised a Tissue Microarray (TMA) with 31
paraffin-embedded samples. This series consisted of
9 paired tumor and normal kidney, and 22 tumoral samples
with no matched non tumoral kidney. The control group
(normal kidney) consisted of renal tissue from the non
tumoral part of the resected specimen following tumor
nephrectomy. Pathologists selected the farthest region to
the tumor. All samples were analyzed by two experienced

correctly identified as WT and the control kidneys did
not present any morphological alteration. Histological
stratification of the samples was performed according
to SIOP [14] classification and the tissue samples were
obtained from the Department of Pathology at the Hospital
Universitario Virgen del Rocío (Seville, Spain). Approval
of the Ethics Committee of this institution was obtained
and written informed consent was obtained before
registration of the patients from the HUVR-IBiS Biobank.
The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Protein analysis

All patient series were treated by neoadjuvant
chemotherapy before nephrectomy according to the
SIOP-93-01 protocol. Patients with localized disease were
treated with vincristine and actinomycin D during 4 weeks
and those with metastatic disease received vincristine,
actinomycin D and doxorubicin  during 6 weeks. SIOP
preoperative treatment protocol is summarized in Table 2.

Proteins were extracted from kidney and WT
frozen tissues in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v)
NP40, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) SDS, 1 mM
EDTA and 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate) supplemented with
10 mM NaF and 2 mM NaOv. Samples were incubated for
20 min on ice and centrifuged for 15 min at 13000 r.p.m.
at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and quantified using
the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc.). Equivalent amounts of proteins were resolved by
SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P,
Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Immunoblotting was
performed using the following antibodies: anti-ABCB4

were obtained from each sample to build up the TMA in
duplicate. Five micron-thick TMA sections were dewaxed,
rehydrated, and immersed in 3% H2O2 aqueous solution
for 30 minutes to exhaust endogenous peroxidase. Heatinduced epitope retrieval was performed with 1 mM EDTA
(pH 9.0) in a microwave oven. Sections were incubated
overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies anti-ABCB4
(MDR3) (Sigma HPA053288; overnight at 1:20 dilution)
and Anti-MRP1 (Abcam-ab137406; overnight at 1:200
dilution). Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies
and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine were applied according to
manufacturer’s protocol (EnVision, Dako). Slides were
then counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted.
Sections where the primary antibody was omitted were
used as negative controls. The plasma membrane and
cytoplasmic was stained for both transporters (MDR3 and
MRP1). Immunostains were scored as negative/positive
expression according to the stain intensity and proportion
of stained cells. Only tumoural cells evaluated as clearly
stained were considered to be positive. The IHC results

Statistical analysis

REFERENCES

Gene expression differences between control
(kidney) and WT were evaluated with the Mann–Whitney
U-test for two groups, and with the Kruskal–Wallis test
for more than two groups, followed by Dunn’s multiple
comparison post test. Paired samples t-test was applied
to compare the mean level of expression within the
same specimens. The Spearman´s Rank test was used to
quantify the correlation of expression between different
genes. Fisher´s exact test was used to evaluate differences
between immunohistochemical expression detection
of MDR3 and MRP1. The disease-free survival time
was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier estimator and
the Wilcoxon test. For all analyses, P-values of ≤ 0.05
were considered statistically significant. Analyses were
performed using the Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad).
