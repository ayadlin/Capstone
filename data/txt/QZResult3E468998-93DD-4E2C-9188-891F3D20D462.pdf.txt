Abstract
Herein, for the first time, we investigated in vivo efficacy and
associated molecular biomarkers and mechanisms of a
chemopreventive agent, silibinin, against human colorectal
carcinoma (CRC) HT29 xenograft growth. Nude mice were
implanted with HT29 cells and fed with vehicle (carboxymethyl cellulose or phosphatidylcholine) or 200 mg/kg/d
dose of silibinin or 100 and 200 mg/kg/d doses of silybinphytosome (5 days per week) for 32 days. Silibinin inhibited
tumor growth that accounted for 48% (P = 0.002) decrease in
tumor volume and 42% (P = 0.012) decrease in tumor weight
at the end of the experiment without any adverse health effect.
A stronger antitumor efficacy was observed with silybinphytosome preparation. Silibinin decreased proliferation
index by 40% (P < 0.001), increased apoptotic index by f2fold (P = 0.001), and reduced microvessel density by 36%
(P = 0.001) in tumors. Antiproliferative and proapoptotic
effects of silibinin were associated with down-regulation of
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt
phosphorylation as well as cyclin D1 expression. Antiangiogenic effect of silibinin was coupled with a strong decrease in
inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and NOS3, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2, and hypoxia-inducing factor-1A
(HIF-1A) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
These findings suggest in vivo antitumor efficacy of silibinin
against CRC involving its antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and
antiangiogenic activities. The inhibition of ERK1/2 and Akt
signaling may account for antiproliferative and proapoptotic
effects, whereas down-regulation of NOS, COX, HIF-1A, and
VEGF expression could lead to antiangiogenic effect of
silibinin against CRC. Overall, potential use of silibinin against
human CRC could be suggested. [Cancer Res 2008;68(6):2043–50]

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health concern around
the world and is the third most common cancer in the United
States (1). Recent statistics suggest an estimated 153,760 new cases
of CRC with 52,180 deaths in 2007 (1, 2). Although genetic defects,
such as mutation in adenomatous polyposis coli and loss of tumor
suppressor p53, are involved in initiation and progression of CRC,
the epigenetic alterations controlling tumor cell proliferation,
survival, inflammation, and angiogenesis also play critical roles in
CRC growth and progression (3–8). In many instances, high cell

proliferation activity, resistance to apoptosis, and enhanced tumor
angiogenesis are associated with the poor prognosis of solid
tumors, including CRC (7, 9, 10). An enhanced tumor cell
proliferation activity is usually accompanied with aberrant cell
cycle progression, and in this regard, CRC expresses high level of
cyclin D1 (11). The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
exerts antitumor effects against CRC (8), where inflammation
favors proliferation as well as angiogenesis that support the role of
inflammatory mechanisms in growth and progression of CRC (12).
Tumor angiogenesis has been observed as an essential component
to support the growth of solid tumors beyond a critical size and
provide a viable route for tumor metastasis to distant organs (10).
Therefore, it has been hypothesized that chemopreventive agents
that could overcome these epigenetic defects could be potentially
effective in controlling CRC.
Our completed studies show that silibinin has both promise and
potential to inhibit the growth of solid tumors, including skin,
prostate, and lung, in animal models (13–15). Silibinin is nontoxic
and has human acceptance as it is used clinically and consumed
as dietary supplement for its hepatoprotective effect (16, 17).
Although silymarin, the parent mixture of the pure and major
biologically active compound silibinin, is shown to inhibit azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis in male F344 rats (18), the
underlying mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated. Further,
until now, the pure compound silibinin has not been studied for its
in vivo efficacy and mechanism against CRC, although our
completed in vitro study with silibinin in human CRC HT29 cells
has shown strong antiproliferative effect (19).
In the present study, we examined in vivo efficacy of oral silibinin
as well as silybin-phytosome (it shows better bioavailability than
pure silibinin) against human CRC HT29 tumor xenograft growth
in athymic nude mice. Additional studies performed include
analysis of extensively used biomarkers in preclinical cancer
models, such as proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),
apoptosis, and tumor microvessel density. We also identified
potential molecular targets of silibinin, including extracellular
signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (Akt)
signaling, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), cyclooxygenase (COX), and
hypoxia-inducing factor-1a (HIF-1a) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), for its antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and
antiangiogenic effects against HT29 tumor growth.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, animals, and chemicals. HT29 cell line was from the
American Type Culture Collection and grown in DMEM (Technologies, Inc.)
with 10% serum (Hyclone), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin under standard conditions. Six-week-old athymic BALB/c
nu/nu male mice were from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD).
Animal care was in accordance with current regulations and standards of
NIH and our institutional guidelines. Silibinin, carboxymethyl cellulose
(CMC), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical

Co. Silybin-phytosome that contains silibinin and PC in 1:2 ratio for better
bioavailability of silibinin was obtained from Indena.
In vivo tumor xenograft study. HT29 cells were grown in culture and
then detached by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended in serum-free
DMEM. Six-week-old athymic BALB/c nu/nu male mice were given a s.c.
injection of 4  106 HT29 cells mixed with Matrigel (1:1) in the right flank to
initiate tumor growth. After 5 days of xenograft implantation when tumor
sizes reached f3 mm in diameter, mice were randomly divided into five
groups and gavaged with the following: (a) control group (n = 8), 0.5% (w/v)
CMC (vehicle); (b) SB-200 (n = 9), 200 mg/kg/d dose of silibinin in CMC; (c)
SP-100 (n = 9), 300 mg/kg/d dose of silybin-phytosome in CMC; (d) SP-200
(n = 9), 600 mg/kg/d dose of silybin-phytosome in CMC; and (e) PC (n = 9),
400 mg/kg/d dose of PC in CMC. All treatments were given 5 days a week
for 32 days. Body weight and diet consumption were recorded twice weekly
throughout the study. Tumor sizes were measured twice weekly and volume
was calculated as reported recently (14). At the end of experiment, tumors
were excised and weighed, and part of tumor was fixed in buffered formalin
and the remaining was stored at 80jC. Based on tumor data, only tumor
samples from control and SB-200 groups were processed for biomarker and
molecular analysis.
Immunohistochemical staining for PCNA, cyclin D1, CD31, VEGF,
inducible NOS, COX-2, and HIF-1A in tumors. Tumor samples fixed
in 10% buffered formalin for 12 h were processed conventionally for
paraffin-embedded tumor sections (5 Am thick). Sections were subjected
to antigen retrieval and blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity (15).
For immunostaining, sections were incubated with mouse monoclonal
anti-PCNA (1:250 dilution; Dako), rabbit polyclonal anti–cyclin D1
(1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), goat polyclonal antiCD31 (1.200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal
anti-VEGF (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal
anti–inducible NOS (iNOS; 1:100 dilution; BD Transduction Laboratories),
rabbit polyclonal anti-COX-2 (1:50 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or
rabbit polyclonal anti–HIF-1a (1:100 dilution; Novus Biologicals, Inc.)
antibody. Sections were then incubated with biotinylated appropriate
secondary antibody followed by conjugated horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-streptavidin (Dako) followed by incubation with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma) working solution at room temperature and
counterstaining with diluted Harris hematoxylin (Sigma). In all immunohistochemical staining, to rule out any nonspecific staining, negative
staining controls were used, where, as required, sections were incubated
with N-Universal Negative Control mouse or rabbit antibody (Dako)
under identical conditions.
Quantification of immunostaining in tumors. Proliferating cells were
quantified by counting PCNA-positive cells and total number of cells at five
arbitrarily selected fields from each tumor at 400 magnification.
Proliferation index was determined as number of PCNA-positive cells 
100 / total number of cells (15). Endothelial cells (microvessels) were
quantified by counting CD31-positive cells at five arbitrarily selected fields
from each tumor at 400 magnification. Microvessel density was
determined as number of CD31-positive cells/400 microscopic field (15).
VEGF, iNOS, and COX-2 were quantified by counting respective positive
cells and total number of cells at 10 randomly selected fields from each
tumor at 400 magnification, and data are presented as percent positive
cells. HIF-1a immunoreactivity in tumors was mostly localized to the
nucleus, which correlates with its transcriptional activity. Therefore, we
quantified HIF-1a–positive nuclei at 10 randomly selected fields from each
tumor at 400 magnification as well as total number of nuclei, and the data
are presented as percent HIF-1a–positive nuclei.
In situ apoptosis detection by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining. The 5-Am-thick sections
of tumor samples (those used for PCNA staining) were analyzed by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) staining using TumorTACS In situ Apoptosis kit (R&D Systems,
Inc.) as published recently (14). Apoptotic cells were counted as DAB-positive
cells (brown stained) at five arbitrarily selected microscopic fields at 400
magnification, together with total number of cells, and apoptotic index was
calculated as number of apoptotic cells  100 / total number of cells (14).

Preparation of tumor homogenate and Western immunoblotting.
Randomly, three tumors were selected each from control and SB-200 groups
and homogenized in nondenaturing lysis buffer using Polytron and
centrifuged at 14,000  g followed by protein concentration determination
in supernatants as reported earlier (15). Equal protein per lysate was
resolved on Tris-glycine gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and
blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were incubated with
desired primary antibody overnight at 4jC and then with appropriate HRPconjugated secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence
detection. Blots were scanned with Adobe Photoshop 6.0 with minimum
background. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti–h-actin
antibody for loading control.
Statistical and microscopic analyses. Statistical analysis was done
with SigmaStat software version 2.03 (Jandel Scientific). Quantitative data
are presented as mean and SE. Microscopic immunohistochemical analysis
was done by Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and
photomicrographs were captured by Carl Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 camera.
Statistical significance of difference between control and silibinin-fed
group was determined by Student’s t test and P < 0.05 was considered
significant.

Results
Silibinin feeding inhibits HT29 tumor xenograft growth in
nude mice. To study silibinin efficacy on CRC development, its
gavage feeding was started to nude mice at day 6 after the
xenograft implantation, a time at which HT29 xenografts were
visibly and measurably established (f3 mm in diameter). We used
two forms of silibinin in CMC vehicle: (a) pure silibinin and (b)
silybin-phytosome; the latter is known for its better absorption in
the gut. Progressive tumor growth was observed in control groups
of mice on CMC or PC in CMC during the experiment (data not
shown); however, the latter one showed a slightly lower tumor
volume and weight, although statistically insignificant (Fig. 1A
and B). Compared with control (CMC), silibinin treatment by oral
gavage at 200 mg/kg/d dose, 5 days a week for 32 days, showed
suppression of tumor xenograft growth throughout the study
(data not shown). At the end, tumor volume per mouse was
933 F 141 mm3 in silibinin (SB-200) treatment group compared
with 1,787 F 173 mm3 (P = 0.002) in control, accounting for a
48% decrease in tumor volume (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this
observation, silibinin caused 42% decrease in tumor weight
(P = 0.012) compared with control (0.74 F 0.08 g/mouse in
silibinin-treated group versus 1.28 F 0.18 g/mouse in control;
Fig. 1B). Compared with silibinin, silybin-phytosome showed
greater antitumor efficacy. The lower dose of silybin-phytosome
(100 mg/kg) showed almost equivalent effect to that of 200 mg/kg
dose of silibinin in decreasing tumor volume and weight (Fig. 1A
and B), and higher dose of silybin-phytosome showed better
antitumor effect compared with its lower dose (Fig. 1A and B).
We also monitored whether silibinin or silybin-phytosome
feeding causes any adverse health effect during the study by
measuring body weight gain and diet consumption profiles, which
are relevant and widely used primary indicators to assess gross
toxicity of a test compound in intervention studies. Oral treatment
of both silibinin and silybin-phytosome did not affect body weight
gain and diet consumption profiles, which were almost comparable
with their respective control groups (Fig. 1C and D). Together,
these findings suggested an in vivo antitumor efficacy of silibinin
against human CRC tumor xenograft in nude mice without any
apparent signs of toxicity. Based on comparable observations, for
biomarkers and molecular analyses, we used tumor samples only
from control and pure silibinin-treated (SB-200) groups.

Figure 1. Effect of oral silibinin feeding on HT29 colorectal tumor xenograft growth, and body weight gain and diet consumption profiles in athymic nude mice.
Four million HT29 cells were s.c. injected in the right flank of each mouse to initiate ectopic tumor growth. CMC or silibinin (200 mg/kg/d silibinin or 300 and 600 mg/kg/d
silybin-phytosome in CMC, 5 d/wk) feeding by gavage started after 6 d of tumor cell injection and continued for 32 d. Similarly, PC (400 mg/kg) was given in CMC
as control for silybin-phytosome that constitutes two-third PC. Final tumor volume (mm3) per mouse (A) and tumor weight (g) per mouse (B) at the end of study. Body
weight per mouse (C ) and average diet consumption per mouse per day (D ) were noted as a function of time. A and B, columns, mean of eight to nine samples
from individual mouse in each group; bars, SE. SB-200, 200 mg/kg silibinin; SP-100, 300 mg/kg silybin-phytosome; SP-200, 600 mg/kg silybin-phytosome.

Silibinin inhibits tumor cell proliferation and induces
apoptosis. The in vivo antiproliferative and apoptotic responses
of silibinin causing inhibition of CRC xenograft growth were
assessed by analyzing tumor samples for PCNA and TUNEL
immunostaining. Qualitative microscopic assessment of PCNAstained tumor sections showed a considerable decrease in PCNA
immunoreactivity in silibinin-treated group compared with control
(data not shown). The quantification of PCNA-positive cells in
tumors showed that silibinin (200 mg/kg dose) treatment to nude
mice results in 40% (P < 0.001) decrease in proliferation index
compared with control (21 F 4% PCNA-positive cells in silibinin
versus 35 F 3% in control group; Fig. 2A). The negative controls,
where control IgG was used instead of anti-PCNA antibody, did
not show any considerable positive staining (data not shown).
The antiproliferative effect of silibinin was further confirmed by
immunoblot analysis where tumor samples from silibinin-treated
group showed a marked decrease in PCNA protein expression
compared with controls (Fig. 2B).
Tumor sections examined for apoptotic cells showed an
increased number of TUNEL-positive brown cells in silibinintreated group compared with control (data not shown). The
quantification of apoptosis showed that silibinin (200 mg/kg dose)
increases apoptotic index by f2-fold (P < 0.001) in tumors over
that of control (Fig. 2C); however, this effect could be relatively less
significant (as only 1% apoptotic cells were observed in silibinintreated tumors) when compared with antiproliferative effect of
silibinin in terms of its role in inhibiting tumor growth. Staining

procedure was verified by using TACS-nuclease as positive control,
which generated DNA fragments and showed positive staining in
all nuclei, whereas labeling buffer was used instead of TdT in
negative control that did not show any positive staining (data not
shown). Overall, these results suggested a predominating role of
in vivo antiproliferative effect of silibinin in suppressing HT29
tumor xenograft growth.
Silibinin decreases cyclin D1 expression in tumors. Cyclin D1
is overexpressed in rapidly cycling cells that propel G1-S phase
transition and correlates with enhanced proliferation (11). Because
PCNA analysis showed antiproliferative effect of silibinin, we also
analyzed its effect on cyclin D1 expression in tumors, where
microscopic analysis of cyclin D1–stained tumors showed lesser
immunoreactivity in silibinin-treated group compared with controls (Fig. 2D, left). The quantification of cyclin D1–positive cells
showed 38 F 1% cells in control versus 17 F 1% cells (55%
decrease; P = 0.005) in silibinin-treated group (Fig. 2D, right).
Further, we confirmed this finding by immunoblot analysis of
tumor lysate in which silibinin-treated group showed lower cyclin
D1 protein expression compared with control (Fig. 2B). These
results suggested that silibinin could inhibit in vivo cell cycle
progression through G1-S transition in HT29 tumors as one of its
potential antiproliferative mechanisms.
Silibinin inhibits ERK1/2 and Akt activation in tumors.
Activation of ERK1/2 and Akt signaling is involved in the growth
and progression of many types of solid tumors, including CRC
(7, 20). Targeting these signaling pathways has shown inhibition of

Figure 2. In vivo antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effects of silibinin in human
CRC HT29 tumor xenograft in nude mice.
At the end of the study detailed in Fig. 1,
a portion of each tumor from control and
silibinin-treated (SB-200 ) groups was
processed for immunohistochemical staining
for PCNA, TUNEL, and cyclin D1 as described
in Materials and Methods. Quantitative data
for proliferation and apoptotic indices are
shown as percent PCNA-positive cells (A) and
percent TUNEL-positive cells (C), respectively.

and cyclin D1 expression as detailed in

tumor growth and progression in many studies (7). Because we
observed that silibinin strongly decreases cell proliferation with
slight increase in apoptosis, its effect on the activation of both
ERK1/2 and Akt was next examined in HT29 tumors. Western blot
analysis of randomly selected tumor samples showed relatively
lower levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and phosphorylated Akt in
silibinin-treated group compared with control without any
considerable change in their total protein levels and h-actin was
used as a loading control (Fig. 3). These results suggested that
in vivo antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of silibinin in
HT29 tumors could be mediated by the down-regulation of ERK1/2
and Akt signaling.
Silibinin inhibits tumor microvessel density and VEGF
expression. Tumor microvessel density is considered as a vital
prognostic biomarker correlating with growth and development of
CRC (21). To assess whether silibinin-caused inhibition of HT29
tumor growth is accompanied by its in vivo antiangiogenic effect,
we examined intratumoral microvessel density by immunohistochemical analysis of CD31 endothelial cell–specific marker.
Microscopic examination of tumors showed numerous CD31stained cells in control group but only few in silibinin-treated
group (data not shown). The quantification of CD31-positive cells
in tumors showed 38 F 8 CD31-positive cells/400 field in control
compared with 24 F 5 in silibinin-treated group, accounting for
37% decrease (P < 0.001) in tumor microvessel density by silibinin
(Fig. 4A). This observation suggests that inhibition of tumor
angiogenesis by silibinin could have contributed to the inhibition
of HT29 tumor growth in mice, which was next supported by VEGF
analysis.
VEGF is the most critical molecular player for angiogenesis (22),
and therefore, we also examined silibinin effect on VEGF
expression in HT29 tumors. Immunostaining for VEGF revealed

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

lower immunoreactivity in tumors from the silibinin-treated group
of mice (Fig. 4B), and the quantification showed 42 F 1% and 20 F
1% VEGF-positive cells in control and silibinin-treated groups,
respectively (Fig. 4C). This accounted for a 52% (P < 0.001) decrease
in VEGF-positive cells by silibinin. We further confirmed the effect
of silibinin on VEGF level by immunoblotting of randomly selected
tumors from both groups. A strong decrease in VEGF protein level
was observed in the tumor samples from silibinin group compared
with control without considerable variation in h-actin as a protein
loading control (Fig. 4D).
Silibinin decreases NOS expression in tumors. Up-regulation
of NOS, specifically iNOS and NOS3 (endothelial NOS), induces
many physiologic processes, including angiogenesis (23, 24).
Consistently, we observed strong immunoreactivity for iNOS in
HT29 tumors, which decreased substantially in silibinin-treated
tumors (Fig. 5A, left). The quantification of iNOS immunostaining showed 46 F 2% iNOS-positive cells in control compared with
14 F 1% in silibinin-treated group, accounting for 70% decrease
(P < 0.001) in iNOS-positive cells (Fig. 5A, right). To further support
these findings, immunoblot analysis was next performed that also
showed a strong decrease in iNOS protein level in silibinin-treated
tumors (Fig. 6A). We also analyzed the expression of other two NOS
family members, NOS1 (neuronal NOS) and NOS3, in both control
and silibinin-treated tumors. Silibinin did not show any effect on
NOS1 but strongly decreased the protein level of NOS3, which is
associated with endothelial cells (Fig. 6A), without considerable
change in h-actin as a protein loading control (Fig. 6A). These
results indicate that tumor-associated iNOS and NOS3, which
regulate tumor angiogenesis, could be potential molecular targets
for the antitumor effect of silibinin.
Silibinin decreases COX expression in tumors. COX-2 has
been strongly implicated in angiogenesis as well as in intestinal and

Figure 3. Effect of oral silibinin on ERK1/2 and Akt activation in HT29 tumors.
Three randomly selected tumors from individual mouse in each group were

colon tumor growth (25). Accordingly, silibinin effect on COX-2
expression was next examined by immunohistochemistry in
tumors where control group samples showed marked immunoreactivity for COX-2 that decreased substantially in the tumors
from silibinin-treated mice (Fig. 5B, left). Quantification of COX-2
staining in tumors showed 45 F 2% COX-2–positive cells in control
versus 22 F 1% in silibinin-treated group, accounting for 51%
(P < 0.001) decrease from that of control (Fig. 5B, right). These
results were further confirmed by immunoblot analysis, which also
showed high level of COX-2 protein in control tumor samples and
a strong decrease by silibinin treatment (Fig. 6B); COX-1 protein
expression was also decreased in silibinin-treated tumors (Fig. 6B),
without considerable change in h-actin as a protein loading control
(Fig. 6B). These results indicate that, in addition to iNOS and NOS3,
silibinin could also target tumor-associated COX-1 and COX-2
expression for its antitumor and antiangiogenic effects.
Silibinin decreases HIF-1A expression in tumors. HIF-1a is
overexpressed in angiogenic tumors and during low oxygen tension

in tissues to initiate angiogenesis and has been implicated in solid
tumor growth, including colon cancer (26, 27). Because antiangiogenic effect of silibinin was observed in HT29 tumors, we further
examined whether silibinin has any effect on HIF-1a expression. In
immunohistochemical analysis, tumors from control group showed
clear immunoreactivity for HIF-1a, and importantly, it was
localized within the nucleus, representing the transcriptionally
active form of HIF-1a (Fig. 5C, left). However, the nuclear
immunoreactivity of HIF-1a was considerably decreased in tumors
from silibinin-treated mice (Fig. 5C, left). Quantification of nuclear
HIF-1a immunostaining in tumors showed 20 F 1% HIF-1a–
positive nuclei in control versus 13 F 1% in silibinin-treated mice
(Fig. 5C, right), which accounted for a 35% (P < 0.001) decrease in
HIF-1a–positive nuclei in HT29 tumors by silibinin. These results
were further confirmed by immunoblot analysis, which also
showed high level of HIF-1a protein in control tumor samples
and a strong decrease by silibinin treatment (Fig. 6B), without considerable change in h-actin as a protein loading control (Fig. 6B).
These results indicate that, in addition to iNOS, NOS3, COX-1, and
COX-2, silibinin could also target tumor-associated expression of
HIF-1a for its antiangiogenic effect.

Discussion
The central findings in the present study are that (a) oral
silibinin feeding suppresses the growth of human CRC HT29 tumor
xenografts in athymic nude mice without any noticeable toxicity;
(b) silybin-phytosome (a formulation for enhanced absorption of
silibinin) shows greater antitumor efficacy compared with pure
silibinin; and (c) antitumor effect of silibinin was associated with a
decrease in proliferation index as observed by reduced PCNA and
cyclin D1 expression, a slight increase in apoptosis, and a strong
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis as observed by CD31 and VEGF
analyses. At molecular level, silibinin showed down-regulation of
mitogenic and survival signaling as it decreased ERK1/2 and Akt
phosphorylation in tumors. Silibinin also decreased the expression
of iNOS, NOS3, COX-1, COX-2, and HIF-1a, which could be
responsible for its strong antiangiogenic effect. These findings

Figure 5. Effect of oral silibinin on iNOS,
COX-2, and HIF-1a expression in HT29
tumors. At the end of the study detailed in
Fig. 1, a portion of each tumor from control
and silibinin-treated (SB-200 ) groups
was processed for immunohistochemical
staining for iNOS, COX-2, and HIF-1a as
described in Materials and Methods. A to C,
representative immunohistochemical data for
immunoreactivity of these molecules are shown
at 400 magnification. The quantification of
iNOS and COX-2 (A and B ) was done as
percent-positive (brown ) cells, whereas for
HIF-1a (C) it was done as percent-positive
(brown ) nuclei as detailed in Materials and
Methods. Columns, mean of eight to nine

suggest further investigation of silibinin efficacy in other CRC
animal models such as chemically induced and transgenic.
Nevertheless, the findings in the present study support the
promising usefulness of silibinin in CRC patients.
The solid tumor growth and progression essentially require
unchecked cell proliferation, loss of apoptosis, and induction of
angiogenesis, and these critical events are positively supported by
growth factor receptor signaling, which becomes constitutively
active in advanced stages of CRC (7, 20, 28). Indeed, several studies
have shown the presence of multiple constitutively active mitogenic, cell survival, and antiapoptotic pathways in CRC, implying
that targeting a single event may not be enough to accomplish the
growth control of CRC. Consequently, it is likely that anticancer
agents targeting multiple tumorigenic events, such as simultaneous
inhibition of both mitogenic and cell survival signaling pathways as
well as tumor angiogenesis, could be more effective in suppressing
CRC growth and progression (28, 29). Consistent with this notion,
in the present study, silibinin showed antitumor efficacy against
human CRC tumor growth in nude mice involving diverse molecular alterations associated with cell proliferation, survival, and
angiogenesis.
For the first time in this study, we also compared the antitumor
efficacy of oral silybin-phytosome with pure silibinin in which
silybin-phytosome showed comparatively greater efficacy than
pure silibinin without any toxicity. Therefore, it was anticipated
that, compared with silibinin, similar oral dose of silybinphytosome will lead to the higher physiologic level of silibinin
in mice. Indeed, this was the case as observed by silibinin

estimation in mouse plasma (data not shown). The tumor growth
inhibition by silibinin was accompanied by a decrease in proliferation index and a slight increase in apoptosis. A corresponding
decrease in PCNA-positive and cyclin D1–positive cells as well as
their protein expression by silibinin was also observed. Cyclin D1
has critical role in cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase
transition, whereas PCNA is a cofactor for DNA polymerase
required for DNA synthesis during S phase (30, 31). Therefore, it is
anticipated that silibinin-caused inhibition of tumor cell proliferation could be associated with G1 phase arrest during cell cycle
progression. This indeed is supported by our in vitro study where
silibinin induced a strong G1 arrest in HT29 cells (19). The in vivo
apoptotic effect of silibinin on tumor cells was statistically significant, but it may not have major contribution in lowering the
tumor growth because the number of apoptotic cells was very few,
accounting for about only 1%.
The antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of silibinin could
be attributed to the inhibition of constitutively active mitogenic
and cell survival signaling in colorectal tumors. As anticipated,
silibinin decreased the phosphorylated levels of both ERK1/2 and
Akt without any effect on their total protein levels in tumors. This
observation indicated a specific effect causing down-regulation of
signaling mediated through ERK1/2 and Akt that was more related
to the antiproliferative effect of silibinin. ERK1/2 and Akt are conversing points for many mitogenic events initiated at membrane
receptor or cytoplasmic levels (7, 20). PCNA is a downstream target
of these signaling pathways that critically regulate cell proliferation
(31). In this regard, in addition to the inhibition of ERK1/2 and Akt

Silibinin Inhibits In vivo Growth of Colorectal Cancer

signaling, silibinin also decreased PCNA-positive tumor cells, providing an in vivo molecular evidence for its antiproliferative activity
and associated mechanisms.
Tumors can stay dormant for years due to a balance between cell
proliferation and apoptosis in the absence of angiogenesis (21). In
such condition, there is also a balance between proangiogenic and
antiangiogenic factors (21). Tumor angiogenesis is facilitated by a
shift in the equilibrium toward the proangiogenic environment.
Therefore, levels of angiogenic inhibitors exceeding that of
stimulators could inhibit tumor growth and progression. In this
regard, many preclinical studies suggest that antiangiogenic
strategy could be a promising approach for cancer control, which
is less likely to acquire drug resistance (32–34). The quantification
of tumor angiogenesis could be a measure of tumor staging for
growth, invasive, and metastatic potential as well as for diagnosis
(35). Consistent with antiangiogenic strategy, silibinin strongly
inhibited the vascularization of CRC tumors as examined by
immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cell–specific CD31
marker.
Solid tumors overexpress angiogenic factors, including VEGF, to
recruit blood vessel for neoangiogenesis as well as to maintain
vascular state of the tumor for its perpetual growth. VEGF is the
most potent angiogenic factor for tumor angiogenesis, as
intervention by inhibiting the production of VEGF or neutralizing
the concentration of VEGF or blocking its receptor signaling has
been shown to inhibit tumor growth (32–34). Many chemopreventive agents down-regulate VEGF production in imparting
their antiangiogenic potential (29, 36, 37). In this study, silibinin
also strongly decreased the level of VEGF expression in HT29
tumors. The decrease in tumor-associated VEGF by silibinin could
be one of the important mechanisms in controlling angiogenesis

Figure 6. Effect of oral silibinin on NOS, COX, and HIF-1a expression in
HT29 tumors. A and B, three randomly selected tumors from individual mouse in
each group were analyzed by Western blot for levels of NOS1, NOS2, NOS3,
COX-1, COX-2, and HIF-1a by using specific antibodies as detailed in Materials
and Methods. Membranes were stripped and reprobed for h-actin as a loading

and causing an inhibition of overall tumor growth. The effect of
silibinin on VEGF was confirmed by both immunohistochemical
and immunoblot analyses of tumors for VEGF expression. Together,
our findings suggested that antiangiogenic potential of silibinin
could be explored for lowering the risk of and preventing the
growth and progression of CRC.
iNOS and NOS3 produce biological nitric oxide that plays an
important role in favoring tumor angiogenesis that supports
tumor growth and progression (38–41). iNOS is usually induced
during pathologic conditions, whereas NOS3 is specifically
produced by endothelial cells to support blood capillary formation
(38). VEGF is also known to produce nitric oxide formation during
angiogenesis (42). In the present study, high expression of both
iNOS and NOS3 was observed in HT29 tumors in control group,
which also showed high microvessel density, and silibinin
treatment decreased the levels of both iNOS and NOS3 as well
as tumor microvessel density. Similar to NOS, COX-2, a key
enzyme for the synthesis of prostaglandins, is also involved in
tumor angiogenesis, growth, and progression (43, 44). Some
studies also show a link between iNOS and COX-2 expression (43).
We observed that silibinin reduces the levels of tumor-associated
COX-1 and COX-2; however, we have previously observed that
silibinin does not have any effect on COX-1 in normal tissue (45).
HIF-1a plays a pivotal role in pathophysiologic angiogenesis via
transcriptional activation of VEGF (46). Overexpression of HIF-1a
along with VEGF occurs in many cancers, including CRC (27, 46, 47).
In the present study, HIF-1a–mediated up-regulation of VEGF
could have been targeted by silibinin in HT29 tumors, as silibinin
strongly decreased the nuclear level of HIF-1a with a concomitant
decrease in VEGF expression. Further, ERK1/2 and Akt signaling
are also known to induce VEGF expression through HIF-1a (48),
which was also down-regulated by silibinin. Together, these findings
suggest that growing HT29 tumors have high levels of iNOS, NOS3,
COX-1, COX-2, and HIF-1a that could effectively mediate tumor
angiogenesis and growth. Therefore, targeting these molecules
could result in a decrease in tumor angiogenesis and shrinkage or
slower growth of tumor size as observed with silibinin treatment in
the present study.
Collectively, present findings provide in vivo evidence for
antiproliferative, apoptotic, and antiangiogenic effects of silibinin, which were associated with the inhibition of human CRC
tumor xenograft growth without any toxicity in mice. Downregulation of ERK1/2 and Akt signaling by silibinin could be
potential in vivo mechanisms to inhibit CRC growth. Silibinincaused decrease in iNOS, NOS3, COX-1, COX-2, and HIF-1a
expression could reduce VEGF production in tumor and suppress
tumor angiogenesis. These findings provide preclinical evidence
for antitumor efficacy of oral silibinin against human CRC as well
as associated potential mechanisms and justify its further
investigation in other CRC preclinical models to widen its scope
and consideration for its usefulness in human CRC patients,
which could be supported by the fact that silibinin is already
successfully tested in phase I trial (49), and is now in phase II
trial, in prostate cancer patients.
