ABSTRACT
ERBB3 is an emerging target for cancer therapy among the EGFR family. Contrary
to resistance against EGFR and ERBB2 targeting, the genetic inhibition of ERBB3
results in anti-tumorigenic in HCT116 colon cancer cells harboring constitutively
active KRAS and PIK3CA mutations. Still, the anti-tumorigenic molecular mechanism
has not been defined. We demonstrated in this study that ERBB3 knockdown resulted
in cell cycle arrest and activation of Bak and Bax-dependent apoptosis. Apoptosis was
irrelevant to the majority of BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins and correlated with the
transcriptional upregulation of Bak and p53-dependent Bax translocation. Treatment
with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, resulted in cell cycle arrest without apoptosis and
a concomitant down-regulation of cap-dependent translation by the suppression of
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. However, the inhibition of cap-dependent translation
by ERBB3 knockdown occurred without altering the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In
addition, ERBB3 knockdown-induced cell cycle arrest was observed in most colon
cancer cells but was accompanied by apoptosis in p53 wild-type cells. These results
indicate that ERBB3 is a potential target for EGFR- and ERBB2-resistant colon cancer
therapy.

INTRODUCTION

lung cancer (NSCLC) cells [7], respectively. The mAb
targeting of either EGFR [8] or ERBB2 [9] also generates
an increased rate of apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro.
In contrast to EGFR and ERBB2, the potency of
ERBB3 as a therapeutic target in cancer has only recently
been recognized. ERBB3 is known to have impaired RTK
activity, unlike other ERBB receptors [10]. However,
ERBB3 is the preferred partner of ERBB2, and ERBB2/
ERBB3 heterodimers induce the most potent downstream
signals for cell proliferation [11, 12]. The most intriguing
feature of ERBB3 is that it contains multiple binding sites
for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K [13, 14], allowing
it to activate the AKT pathway, a critical signal in a variety
of cancers [15]. Not surprisingly, the overexpression of
ERBB3 has been frequently detected in many types of
human cancers [16], and accumulating evidence strongly
suggests that ERBB3 plays a crucial role in cancers driven
by EGFR and ERBB2 [17]. Moreover, the activation of
the ERBB3-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway renders cancer
cells sensitive or resistant to ERBB inhibitors, depending

The ERBB family includes ERBB1 (known
as EGFR), ERBB2, ERBB3 and ERBB4, a single
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that
forms homo- or heterodimers with other members,
phosphorylating the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor to
recruit the adaptors for downstream signaling pathways
[1]. Because the overexpression or hyperactive mutations
in ERBB family drive uncontrolled cell proliferation and
survival, several drugs targeting the ERBB family have
been used to treat cancer patients [2]. Preclinical studies
with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting EGFR or
ERBB2 have indicated that these anti-tumorigenic actions
partly result from the elevated level of apoptosis. For
example, treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib, a TKI for
EGFR, causes enhanced apoptosis in several cancer cells
in vitro [3-5] or in xenograft tumor growths from breast
cancer patients [6] and EGFR-dependent non-small cell

on the cellular context [18, 19]. Recent findings on transautophosphorylation ERBB3 activity [20] and oncogenic
ERBB3 mutation in human cancers [21] have marked
ERBB3 as an even more potent target for cancer therapy.
The genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ERBB3
results in anti-tumorigenic activity in cancer cells, both
in vitro and as xenograft [5, 22-27], and sensitizes lung
cancer cells [27] and breast cancer cells [28] to lapatinib,
a dual TKI of EGFR and ERBB2. An ERBB3 blockade
results in the retardation of cell proliferation and elevated
apoptosis in colon cancer cells [25, 29], however, the
mechanism leading to apoptosis is unknown.
The Bcl-2-regulated intrinsic death pathway consists
of anti-apoptotic, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family and Bcl-2homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins. BH3-only
proteins play a key role in mediating distinct apoptotic
signaling, including signals elicited by targeting oncogenic
pathways [30]. Apoptosis resulting from the inhibition of
EGFR is known to be mediated by the activation of Bad
in the mammary epithelial cells [31], by the induction
of Bim in NSCLC cells [32-34] or by the induction of
Puma in head and neck cancer cells [35]. ERBB2-targeted
mAb induces apoptosis by reducing Bcl-2 or Mcl-1
expression in ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cells [36,
37]. Recently, it has been shown that lapatinib-induced
apoptosis requires Bim and Puma in ERBB2-amplified
breast cancer cells [38]. HCT116 cells express high levels
of EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB3, but barely detectable
ERBB4 [29]. The targeting of either EGFR [39, 40] or
ERBB2 [41] unveils a resistance that is most likely due to
the KRAS and PIK3CA mutations harbored in wild-type
HCT116 cells, activating the MAPK and AKT pathways
constitutively required for efficient cell growth [42-44].
However, ERBB3 knockdown-induced apoptosis in
HCT116 cells suggests that an alternative pathway led to
the stimulation of apoptosis. In the present study, we have
analyzed the molecular mechanisms related to the antitumorigenic effects of the ERBB3 knockdown in colon
cancer cells. The ERBB3 knockdown in HCT116 cells
results in apoptosis, mediated by the induction of Bak
and the translocation of Bax. Moreover, cell cycle arrest
occurs in most colon cancer cells and is accompanied
by apoptosis in a number of cell lines, supporting the
potential for ERBB3 as a target in colon cancer therapy.

disappeared within 24 h (Figure 5B) after treatment, an
inhibition of cell proliferation was manifested 72 h (Figure
1A). Cell cycle analysis revealed that siERBB3 caused
an increase in the number of cells in sub-G1 and G1,
indicating the occurrence of cell death and G1 arrest. G1arrested cells had already accumulated 48 h (Figure 1B).
Although treatment with 1 nM of siERBB3 was sufficient
to deplete the ERBB3 protein near completely, the
apoptosis measured by the proteolytic cleavage of Parp1
continued to increase, even at 5 nM of siERBB3 (Figure
1C), consistent with the sub-G1 fraction. Apoptosis
sharply increased 48 h after siERBB3 treatment (Figure
1D). To determine whether the siERBB3-induced G1
arrest and apoptosis were due to the ERBB3 depletion, the
cells were transfected with mouse Erbb3 cDNA expression
vector before knockdown. Overexpression of the cDNA
maintained the basal level of ERBB3, even during the
ERBB3 knockdown (Figure 1F). Cells transfected with
cDNA showed an attenuation of the siERBB3-induced G1
arrest (Figure 1E) and apoptosis (Figure 1F), compared
to cells with empty vectors, suggesting that G1 arrest and
apoptosis is mediated by ERBB3 knockdown but not by
off-target effects.

ERBB3 knockdown alters the amount of pro- and
anti-apoptotic proteins and Bax translocation
Considering the hyperactive KRAS and PIK3CA
mutations in HCT116 cells, ERBB3 knockdown may not
affect the amount of Bim or phospho-Bad. As expected, the
ERBB3 knockdown did not alter the level of phospho-Bad
(Figure 2A) and rather down-regulated the levels of Bad,
Bid, Bim, Noxa and Puma (Figure 2A), indicating that
BH3-only groups do not mediate apoptosis. Interestingly,
the ERBB3 knockdown decreased the amount of Bcl-xL
and Mcl1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family (Figure 2B, C).
However, the exogenous expression of Bcl-xL or Mcl1
alone did not block ERBB3 knockdown-induced apoptosis
(Supplemental Figure 1). Among the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family, the amount of Bak only increased inversely to
the levels of Bcl-xL and Mcl1 by ERBB3 knockdown
(Figure 2B, C). The amount of Birc5, a member of the
inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family, was decreased by
ERBB3 knockdown. To determine whether the changes in
the protein levels were due to differential gene expression,
the amount of transcripts was measured. In contrast to the
consistent BCL2L1 and MCL1 mRNA levels, ERBB3
knockdown resulted in the upregulation of BAK1 and
downregulation of BIRC5 transcripts levels (Supplemental
Figure 2). These data suggest that changes in the amount
of Bak and Birc5 proteins are primarily regulated at the
transcriptional level, while those of Bcl-xL and Mcl1
proteins are regulated at the translational level.
Because translocations of the Bcl-2 family from
the cytosol to the mitochondria play an important role in

apoptosis [45], we compared the amount of proteins in
the cytosol versus the mitochondria. The ratios of cytosol

to membrane/organelle fractions were similar in Bcl-xL
and Mcl1 (Figure 2D). As Bak proteins exist solely in
the membrane fraction, the elevation of Bak was noted
directly in the membrane/organelle fraction (Figure 2D,
E). Interestingly, no Bax translocation occurred within 48
h, although such an event manifested 72 h (Figure 2D, E),
indicating that the mitochondrial Bax translocation is also
involved in apoptosis.

Bak and Bax mediate ERBB3 knockdowninduced apoptosis
ERBB3 knockdown-induced G1 arrest and apoptosis
were further analyzed in isogenic mutant HCT116
cells to investigate the significance of Bak and Bax.
ERBB3 knockdowns resulted in the attenuation of cell
proliferation in all three mutant cells, as in HCT116 cells
(Figure 3A). However, the ERBB3 knockdown caused
a slightly more reduced cell proliferation in Bak-/- cells
and an even more minor reduction in Bax-/-Bak-/- DKO
cells (Wild-type, 53%; Bax-/-, 55%; Bak-/-, 32%; DKO,
62% compared to siCTRL-treated group, respectively).
FACS analysis displayed that the differential inhibition of
cell proliferation in each cell line might reflect changes
in the cell cycle distribution, compared to wild-type
HCT116 cells (Figure 3B). In Bax-/- cells, the ERBB3
knockdown resulted in less sub-G1 but greatly increased
G1 populations; these changes were more dramatic in Bax/Bak-/- DKO cells. In contrast, ERBB3 knockdown led to
a larger sub-G1 population in Bak-/- cells. The ratios of
sub-G1 cells were correlated with the relative levels of
Parp1 cleavage in each cell line (Figure 3C). The ERBB3
knockdown-induced downregulation of Bcl-xL and Mcl1
was independent of Bax or Bak. The ERBB3 knockdown
caused a little less Parp1 cleavage in Bax-/- cells and even
more Parp1 cleavage in Bak-/- cells, compared to wild-type
HCT116 cells. This elevated apoptosis in Bak-/- cells was
likely due to the early Bax translocation, which occurred
at 48 h (Figure 3D). To confirm the significance of Bak
upregulation in apoptosis, wild-type HCT116 cells were
pretreated with siBak before siERBB3 treatment to reduce
the Bak level. Compared to those of ERBB3 knockdown
alone, knockdowns of Bak and ERBB3 together resulted
in a lessened inhibition of cell proliferation (Figure 3E),
a smaller sub-G1 increase (Figure 3F), and less Parp1
cleavage (Figure 3G), respectively. These results further
support the conclusion that Bak upregulation plays a
partial role in ERBB3 knockdown-induced apoptosis.

knockdown-induced G1 arrest and apoptosis using
mutant p53-/- cells. The ERBB3 knockdown-induced antiproliferation, sub-G1 increase and Parp1 cleavage were
all reduced partially in the p53-/- cells, compared to the
parental p53+/+ cells (Figure 4A, B and C). However, the
increase in the G1 population was similar between the two
cell lines (Figure 4B), indicating that p53 is not involved
with G1 arrest. Western blots (Figure 4C) showed that
the reductions of Bcl-xL, Mcl1 and Birc5 occurred
similarly in p53-/- cells. The amount of Bax, one of the
transcriptional targets of p53 [46], was reduced to a half
level in p53-/- cells but was not altered in the membrane/
organelle fraction (Figure 4D). The ERBB3 knockdowninduced Bak increase still occurred in p53-/- cells to a
lesser extent because of the higher basal Bak level (Figure
4C). However, the basal and knockdown-induced BAK1

mRNA levels were all similar in wild-type, p53+/+ and p53/cells (Figure 4E), indicating a p53-independent BAK1
mRNA expression. All together, these results reveal that
p53 is not involved in G1 arrest, but the p53-dependent
Bax translocation to the mitochondria participates in
apoptosis driven by ERBB3 knockdown.

ERBB3 knockdown attenuates cap-dependent
translational pathway independent of PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activates the capdependent mRNA translation initiation by phosphorylating
the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) [47]. Because the
activation of ERBB receptors precedes PI3K, it is likely

that the mutant PI3K still stimulates the downstream AKT
pathway, despite the ERBB3 knockdown. However, the
ERBB3 knockdown still reduces the levels of the BclxL, Mcl1 and Birc5 (Figure 2B, C) as well as Cyclin
D1 proteins (Supplemental Figure 4A, B), which are
sensitive to eIF4E availability [48]. To understand this
discrepancy, we analyzed ERBB3 knockdown-induced
signaling changes by western blotting. The relative levels
of phospho-PDK1, phospho-AKT and phospho-mTOR
were similar between the siERBB3 and siCTRL-treated
groups (Figure 5A), indicating that PI3K/AKT/mTOR
is not altered by the ERBB3 knockdown. Interestingly,
the ERBB3 knockdown decreased the level of phospho4E-BP1 slightly, in contrast to the consistent levels of
phospho-S6K and phospho-S6 (Figure 5A). Moreover,
decreases in the level of phospho-4E-BP1 occurred rapidly

without any significant changes in phospho-mTOR (Figure
5B), suggesting the presence of an mTOR-independent
regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by ERBB3
knockdown. The phosphorylation of eIF4E was steady
until 24 h by ERBB3 knockdown, but the phospho-eIF4E
decreased thereafter, accompanied by reduced protein
levels (Figure 5A, B). The ERBB3 knockdown resulted in
a downregulation of the phospho-EGFR, but the general
phospho-MAPKs were relatively unchanged, except for
phospho-p38 (Supplemental Figure 3A). Interestingly,
the amounts of ERBB2, MAPK1/3, and p38 protein were
decreased by ERBB3 knockdown (Supplemental Figure
3A), suggesting a broad attenuation of translation by the
ERBB3 knockdown. Overall, these results suggest that the
ERBB3 knockdown results in the reduction of phospho4E-BP1 and eIF4E involved in cap-dependent translation

without any significant alteration of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway.

Bcl-xL, Mcl1, Birc5, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 proteins
decreased by LY294002 (Figure 6C and Supplemental
Figure 4C, D) similarly as in the ERBB3 knockdown.
On the other hand, neither an increase in the Bak proteins
(Figure 6C) nor a Bax translocation (Figure 6D) occurred
by LY294002. The amount of Bak, instead, decreased by
LY294002 (Figure 6C, D) along with a slight reduction in
the BAK1 mRNA level (Figure 6E). The levels of BCL2L1
and MCL1 mRNA were relatively consistent (Figure 6E),
suggesting that the reduction of Bcl-xL and Mcl1 are
regulated at the translational level, similar to the siERBB3
treatment. The downregulation of BIRC5 mRNA (Figure
6E) was also similar to siERBB3 treatment.
Analysis of downstream signaling changes by
LY294002 showed that the reduction of phospho-AKT and
phospho-mTOR levels occurred rapidly after LY294002
treatment (Figure 6F, G), although those levels had
recovered at 48 h after treatment. LY294002 attenuated
the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1, downstream
targets of mTOR, up to 48 h. The phosphorylation of S6,

data to those by ERBB3 knockdown to identify ERBB3
knockdown-specific signaling pathways. LY294002
attenuated the proliferation of HCT116 cells in a dosedependent manner (Figure 6A). FACS analysis revealed
that LY294002 caused an increase in the G1 populations,
indicating that a G1 arrest occurred (Figure 6B). In
contrast to the ERBB3 knockdown, there was no sub-G1
increase (Figure 6B) or Parp1 cleavage (Figure 6C)
by LY294002, indicating that the attenuation of cell
proliferation was due to cell cycle arrest. The amounts of

a downstream target of S6K, was correlated with the level
of phospho-S6K. However, the level of phospho-eIF4E
was elevated by LY294002, contrary to the reduction by
the ERBB3 knockdown (Figure 6F, G). LY294002 did
not alter the phosphorylation of the MAPK pathways
generally (Supplemental Figure 3B).
While the differential downstream pathways
are inactivated, both the ERBB3 knockdown and
LY294002 are able to inhibit cell proliferation efficiently.
Thus, we examined the effects of co-treatment with
siERBB3 and LY294002 on cells. Co-treatment with

siERBB3 and LY294002 caused a more severe antiproliferation than either treatment alone (Supplemental
Figure 5A). Cell cycle analysis displayed a substantial
increase in the G1 phase by co-treatment (Supplemental
Figure 5B). However, there was no increase in the
sub-G1 (Supplemental Figure 5B) or Parp1 cleavage
(Supplemental Figure 5C), indicating that the additive
inhibition of cellular proliferation by co-treatment is
mainly due to increases in the G1 arrest without changes
in apoptosis.

was performed using cytosol or membrane/organelle fractions that had been prepared 24 h after 20 μM of LY294002 (+) or DMSO (–)

ERBB3 knockdown induces anti-proliferation in
the various human colon cancer cell lines

the retardation of cell proliferation in the majority of cell
lines, except for SW480 (Figure 7A). FACS analysis
showed that ERBB3 knockdown led to G1 arrest in SW48,
SW480 and SW620 cells like as HCT116 cells or G2/M
arrest in LoVo, DLD-1 and HT-29 cells (Figure 7B),
consistent with the previous report [25]. Parp1 cleavage

and mitochondrial Bax translocation were also detected in
the SW48 cells (Figure 7D) harboring wild-type PIK3CA.

A spectrum of mutations found in human colon
cancer cells (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/

signaling. To investigate whether ERBB3 targeting is
still effective across such diverse mutations, we analyzed
the effect of ERBB3 knockdown on several colon cancer
cells with elevated ERBB3. ERBB3 knockdown caused

Overall, the ERBB3 knockdown resulted in G1 or G2/M
arrest and concomitant apoptosis in some cell lines,
indicating that ERBB3-targeted therapy may be effective,
despite the varying mutations.

is not needed for ERBB3 knockdown-induced apoptosis
when Bax is present, consistent with the previous findings
of predominant Bax-dependent apoptosis by various
stimuli [58]. However, the moderate apoptosis in Bax-/cells indicates that while Bak can be activated independent
of Bax, the latter is also required for the full induction
of apoptosis. The significance of Bak activation is further
confirmed here in its co-treatment with ERBB3 siRNA and
LY294002, where less apoptosis correlates with less of an
increase in Bak.
Because approximately 40-50% of colorectal
cancers harbor TP53 mutations (http://p53.free.fr/
Database/p53_cancer/p53_Colon.html), ERBB-targeted
therapies should be considered under the TP53 status. p53
is involved in apoptosis by regulating the transcription
of BAX, PUMA and NOXA [59], as well as the Bax
translocation [60]. The absence of Bax translocation
seems to be the primary reason for the lower rate of
apoptosis against ERBB3 inhibition in p53-/- cells. The
significant amount of basal Bak in p53-/- cells does not
cause an elevated rate of apoptosis, which indicates that
ERBB3 knockdown-induced apoptosis requires Bak
activation beyond BAK1 transcription. Both p53 and
p73 play a major role in DNA damage-induced BAK1
transcription in HCT116 cells [61], however, a slight
BAK1 mRNA increase without p53 and p73, similar to
that in the ERBB3 knockdown, suggests the presence of
p53- and p73-independent transcription regulation. The
observation that basal or ERBB3 knockdown-induced
BAK1 mRNA levels are similar in wild-type, p53+/+ and
p53-/- cells also indicates the p53-independent regulation
of BAK1 expression. Although p53 mediates cell cycle
arrest, the observation here that p53 doesn’t affect ERBB3
knockdown-induced G1 arrest in p53-/- cells indicates that
cell cycle arrest by ERBB3 inhibition is independent
of p53 in a wide range of colon cancer cells. However,
HCT116, SW48 and LoVo cells which harboring wild-type
TP53 show a more apoptosis, supporting that p53 plays a
role in apoptosis by ERBB3 inhibition.
Similar to other colon cancer cells [62], we report
here that LY294002 exerts anti-tumorigenic effects
on HCT116 cells by inhibiting their cell proliferation.
The concentrations in our experiments (20 μM) did not
cause apoptosis, despite the efficient downregulation of
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway followed by the reduction of
phospho-S6K and phospho-4E-BP1, both of which are
controlled by mTOR directly [63]. The cell cycle arrest
without apoptosis in HCT116 cells by another PI3K
inhibitor [64], together with our report, indicates that
the anti-tumorigenic effect of PI3K inhibition may result
from the reduced cell proliferation, but not survival. The
4E-BPs inhibit cap-dependent translation by sequestering
the eIF4E, and the phosphorylation of 4E-BPs dissociates
eIF4E to make the eIF4F complex necessary for capdependent translation [47]. A 4E-BP1 is known to play
a key role in integrating the AKT and MAPK pathways

DISCUSSION
Targeting the ERBB family inhibits tumor growth
by suppressing downstream pathways, including the
MAPK and AKT pathways, which are associated with
cell proliferation and survival [49]. However, mutations
downstream of ERBB that activate either pathway limit
the clinical outcomes of ERBB-targeted cancer therapy
[50]. In colorectal cancers, KRAS mutations are known
to determine the clinical efficacy [51] and acquired
resistance to EGFR targeting [52, 53]. In addition, either
PI3KCA mutations or the loss of PTEN expression
affects the resistance of cells to EGFR-targeted mAb
[40]. Tumorigenic HCT116 cell growth is mainly due
to heterozygous substitution mutations in KRAS G13D
[42] and PIK3CA H1047R [43], which confer resistance
to EGFR [39, 40] or ERBB2 [41] targeting by the
constitutive activation of the MAPK and AKT pathways
[43, 44], respectively. Indeed, the inhibition of both
pathways efficiently induces anti-tumorigenesis [44,
54, 55], including elevated apoptosis [44, 55]. Contrary
to resistance to EGFR or ERBB2 targeting in HCT116
cells, the ERBB3 knockdown alone sufficiently causes an
attenuation of cell growth by inhibiting proliferation and
elevating apoptosis, suggesting the presence of ERBB3specific signal pathways that affect HCT116 cell growth.
The apoptosis induced by EGFR or ERBB2
targeting is mediated primarily by perturbing the BH3only proteins or, alternatively, by regulating the expression
of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, depending on the cell
types. Previous reports have shown that Bad in breast
cancer cells [56] or Bim in NSCLC [32-34] can integrate
the MAPK and AKT signals for cell survival and death in
the EGFR blockade. The significant induction of apoptosis
by ERBB3 inhibition in HCT116 cells is unexpected
without the alteration of two major downstream
pathways. Certainly, our results showed that a majority
of BH3-only proteins controlled by the MAPK or AKT
pathway were not directly correlated with the ERBB3
knockdown-induced apoptosis. While increases in the
amount of mitochondrial Bak and the Bax translocation,
only observed in ERBB3 knockdowns but not in the
LY294002 treatment, were crucial to induce apoptosis
by ERBB3 inhibition. The activation of the pro-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family, Bak and Bax, leads to apoptosis by forming
channels to release cytochrome C and the subsequent
activation of the caspase pathways [57]. Similar to the
resistance of Bax-/-Bak-/- DKO cells to various apoptotic
stimuli [58], these cells are also resistant to ERBB3
knockdown-induced apoptosis. The even greater rate of
apoptosis in Bak-/- than in wild-type cells suggests that Bak

in HCT116 cells, as the inhibition of both pathways
efficiently downregulates phospho-4E-BP1 [43, 44].
Moreover, the forced expression of a mutant 4E-BP1
with a defect in the phosphorylation sites was shown to
suppress xenograft tumor growths [44]. To our surprise,
the ERBB3 knockdown results in rapid and consistent
decreases in the phospho-4E-BP1 slightly, without any
significant changes of phospho-mTOR and phosphoS6K, indicating that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-independent
pathway that regulates phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. This
attenuation of phospho-4E-BP1 and the downregulation
of eIF4E level together seem to reduce the availability of
free eIF4E and have been sufficient to downregulate the
translation of Bcl-xL, Mcl1, Birc5 and Cyclin D1, which
are sensitive to cap-dependent translation initiation [48]
and subsequent attenuation of proliferation.
Overall, the ERBB3 blockade resulted in antitumorigenic effects without altering the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathways in HCT116 cells by inhibiting cell proliferation
or elevating Bak- and Bax-dependent apoptosis. Moreover,
ERBB3 inhibition can provide significant anti-tumorigenic
actions against colon cancer cells, despite the KRAS,
PI3KCA and TP53 mutations. Similar to the finding of
TBK1 as a potent target for HER2-positive breast cancer
[65], an identification of molecular targets regulated by
ERBB3 signal pathways will be beneficial to design a
new regime for ERBB3-targeted therapy or a combination
therapy for treating colorectal cancers.

[29]. The sense sequences for ERBB3 siRNA (siERBB3)
are, 5′-GGCCAUGAAUGAAUUCUCUACUCUA-3′,
5′-GGAAGUUUGCCAUCUUCGUCAUGUU-3′, and
5′-AGGACCAGAGCUUCAAGACUGUUUA-3′.
For ERBB3 knockdown, equimolar ratio of three
siRNA was mixed and scrambled duplex with
high GC content (Life Technologies) was used for
control siRNA (siCTRL). Bak siRNA (siBak) duplex
(Genolution Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, Korea) is 21 bp
including 3’ UU-overhangs. The sequence of the siBak
oligonucleotides is 5’-CCGACGCUAUGACUCAGAG
-3’. The siCTRL for Bak knockdown is
5’-CCUCGUGCCGUUCCAUCAGGUAG -3’. For
the knockdown of Bak and ERBB3 together, siBak
transfection was followed by siERBB3 transfection 24 h
later. Erbb3 cDNA expression vector was constructed by
subcloning of mouse full length Erbb3 cDNA (Thermo
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) into pcDNA3.1. HCT116
cells at 70% confluency were transfected with 2.5 μg of
cDNA expression vector or pcDNA3.1 vector using LT1
reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI, USA) and then the cells
(2×105) were seeded 24 h after DNA transfection followed
by further transfection with 5 nM of siRNA 24 h later.

LY294002 treatment
Different number of cells, 6×105 (treatment for 6 or
12 h), 4×105 (for 24 h) and 2×105 (for 48 h) were seeded
20 h before LY294002 treatment, respectively. LY294002
stock solution (10 mM, EMD Millipore, Darmstadt,
Germany) was diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
and equal amount of solution was added (final DMSO
concentration is 0.2%).

METHODS
Cell culture

Cell proliferation assay

Colon cancer cells were obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, VA, USA) or KCLB (Seoul, Korea). DLD-1,
LoVo, SW48, SW480 and SW620 cells were maintained
in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2. Wild-type, p53+/+, p53-/-, Bax-/-, Bak-/-, Bax-/Bak-/- DKO HCT116 [58, 66, 67] and HT-29 cells were
maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with
10% FBS. Both floating and adherent cells were harvested
for the cell proliferation assay or FACS analysis, whereas
adherent cells were washed twice with cold PBS and
immediately stored at -80°C for RNA or protein extraction.

Cell proliferation was quantified by counting the
live cells after staining with trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA).

Cell cycle analysis with FACS
Cells (1 × 106) were washed in PBS once and fixed
in 70% ethanol for 30 min at -20°C. The fixed cells were
washed once with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml PBS and
treated with 0.1 mg/ml of RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich) for
10 min at room temperature. The cells were stained with
50 μg/ml of propidium iodide (EMD Millipore) for 10 min
on ice and DNA content of cells was measured by flow
cytometer (FACSCaliber, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA,
USA).

Transfection of cells with siRNA or DNA
To adjust cell confluency at the time of harvesting,
6×105 (treatment for 3, 6 or 12 h), 4×105 (for 24 h), 2×105
(for 48 h) and 1×105 (for 72 h) cells were seeded 18 h
before siRNA treatment, respectively. siRNA duplex
oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) were delivered into cells as described previously
