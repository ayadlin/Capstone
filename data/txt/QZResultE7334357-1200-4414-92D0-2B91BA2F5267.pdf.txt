ABSTRACT
Osimertinib is an effective third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved in multiple countries and regions
for patients with EGFR T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Despite impressive initial tumor responses, development of drug resistance ultimately
limits the benefit of this compound. Mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib are
just beginning to emerge, such as EGFR C797S and L718Q mutations, BRAF V600E
and PIK3CA E545K mutations, as well as ERBB2 and MET amplification. However,
a comprehensive view is still missing. In this study, we presented the first case
of Chinese NSCLC patient who developed resistance to osimertinib, and discovered
de novo EGFR G796D mutation as a potential mechanism. Our findings provided
insights into mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib and highlighted tumor
heterogeneity and clonal evolution during the development of drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION

platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (10.1 vs. 4.4 months;
hazard ratio, 0.30; P < 0.001), and the objective response
rate (ORR) was significantly better with osimertinib than
with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (71% vs. 31%;
odds ratio, 5.39; P < 0.001) [21].
So far, only a few studies have been performed
to understand potential mechanisms of resistance
to osimertinib. EGFR C797S mutation has been
demonstrated as a principle mechanism of acquired
resistance [22, 23], presumable through abolishing
the covalent binding between osimertinib and C797
residue. In addition, there are a limited number of case
reports detailing the identification of EGFR L718Q,
BRAF V600E and PIK3CA E545K mutations, as well as
ERBB2 and MET amplification [23–26]. Little is known
about alternative resistance mechanisms, the prevalence
of each type of mechanisms, and the ethnic differences
in resistance profiles. In this study, we present a case
report on the first Chinese osimertinib NSCLC patient.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating
mutations (e.g., L858R and exon 19 deletion) account for
30–60% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases
in Asia [1–3]. NSCLC patients with EGFR activating
mutations respond to first- and second-generation EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [4–13]. However, drug
resistance inevitably develops, with ~60% of events
attributing to a secondary EGFR T790M gatekeeper
mutation [14–16]. Osimertinib is an oral, irreversible,
mutant-selective third-generation EGFR-TKI developed
against NSCLC bearing EGFR activating mutation and
T790M [17–19]. In the AURA and AURA3 studies,
osimertinib was highly active in lung cancer patients with
T790M mutation who had progressed during prior therapy
with EGFR-TKIs [20, 21]. Among T790M-positive
NSCLC patients, the median progression-free survival
(PFS) was significantly longer with osimertinib than with

a partial response. However, she developed systemic
progressive disease (PD) at ~6.5-month post-osimertinib
and switched to radiotherapy subsequently (Figure 1).

plasma samples

RESULTS

To understand the mechanisms underlying resistance
to osimertinib in patient246, we collected and profiled her
plasma samples from three time points – pre-gefitinib,
gefitinib PD and osimertinib PD (Figure 1). Using
next-generation panel sequencing, we identified EGFR
L858R mutation with mutant allele frequency (MAF)
of 4.28% in the pre-gefitinib plasma sample (Figure 2).
Interestingly, low MAF (0.61%) of EGFR G796D was
also detected at this point. After gefitinib PD, T790M
emerged to MAF of 1.85%, consistent with tissue testing
results. Upon osimertinib PD, both L858R and T790M
became undetectable, however, G796D increased to
MAF of 1.91% (Figure 2). As control, none of the three
types of mutations were detected in whole blood. These
data suggested that G796D was a de novo mutation
likely involved in resistance to osimertinib. The different
dynamics of L858R, T790M and G796D during treatment
journey also implicated that G796D might be a standalone
mutation independent of L858R and T790M.

Medical history of patient246
Patient246 was a 56 year-old female diagnosed
as stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (T4N2M1b), with
multiple distant metastasis lesions including brain and
bone (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1). She had
received multiple lines of chemotherapy including 4 cycles
of gemcitabine/cisplatin and 2 cycles of pemetrexed/
carboplatin for 2 years and 5 months in total. After disease
progression, she switched to gefitinib and showed a
partial response within 1 month of treatment. At 13-month
post-gefitinib, she relapsed and EGFR T790M mutation
was detected from biopsy of progressed primary lesion
(Figure 1). Through special approval of “named patient use”
due to unavailability of osimertinib in Chinese market at
the time, she became the first patient to receive osimertinib
in China. After 6 weeks of treatment, scans demonstrated

DISCUSSION

EGFR G796D mutation as the resistance
mechanism to osimertinib

Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples have been
shown to contain tumor-specific genomic alterations
and utilized to dynamically monitor tumor response and
relapse [27, 28]. Comparing with tissue testing, plasma
testing is often associated with lower sensitivity but on
the other hand, can circumvent the challenges in obtaining
re-biopsy specimens and “false-negatives” resulted from
tumor heterogeneity. The abundances of mutations in
cfDNA are correlated with tumor burden, stage and
metastasis status [29, 30]. And several studies have
demonstrated that quantitative measurement of mutation
abundances in cfDNA could be used to accurately reflect
clinical response and emerge of resistance [31–33]. In
this study, we used cfDNA to understand the resistance
mechanisms of osimertinib.
Our dynamic genomic analysis of serial cfDNA
samples from patient246 at time points of pre-gefitinib,
gefitinib PD and osimertinib PD discovered EGFR G796D
mutation as a new resistance mechanism to osimertinib.
The MAF of G796D in cfDNA samples increased from
0.61% at pre-gefitinib to 1.91% upon osimeritinib PD.
Meanwhile, the acquired T790M mutation following
gefitinib PD was cleared to the undetectable level by
osimeritinib, which is consistent with the reported data
in some patients receiving second-line treatment of

G796 is located adjacent to C797 residue, where
osimertinib forms covalent bond with EGFR. Thus
we hypothesized that G796D could drive resistance
to osimertinib by interfering with osimertinib-EGFR
interaction. Indeed, structural modeling of EGFR kinase
domain in complex with osimertinib showed that the
side chain of mutated D796 residue would clash into
the molecular surface of osimertinib, lead to a steric
and energetic repulsion, and result in the loss of binding
affinity (Figure 3).
To confirm that G796D could induce resistance
to osimertinib, we generated stable lines of Ba/F3 cells
carrying various EGFR mutants (Supplementary Figure 2).
IL3-independent growth assay suggested that G796D
was likely a mild oncogenic driver comparing to L858R
and L858R/T790M mutations (Supplementary Figure 3).
Osimertinib inhibited the growth of L858R or L858R/
T790M lines with GI50 of 30–40 nM, but GI50 increased to
1.5–2 µM in G796D mutant line, with about 50-fold shift
(Figure 4A). Moreover, p-EGFR level of G796D mutant
line, and its downstream p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 levels were
not modulated by osimertinib up to 1 µM concentration
(Figure 4B). These cellular functional results suggested
that G796D mutation rendered the resistance to osimertinib.

pre-gefitinib to 1.91% upon osimertinib PD, while T790M acquired at gefitinib resistance was cleared by osimertinib.

Figure 3: Structural modeling of EGFR G796D in complex with osimertinib. G796D mutation is expected to sterically

interfere with binding of osimertinib. The hydrophilic side chain CH2COOH of mutated D796 residue will bump into the greasy core of
osimertinib, which would either push the inhibitor out of the current binding mode, or distort the loop and affect the hinge binding. Either
case could lower the binding affinity of osimertinib. The orange disks indicate the clashes between the side chain of the mutated reside and
the core of osimertinib.

and ERK1/2 levels.

osimertinib or rociletinib, another third-generation EGFRTKI [22, 23, 26, 34, 35]. This dynamic switch between
G796D and T790M mutations suggested a clonal evolution
event which featured diminishment of T790M-positive
clones and outgrowth of pre-existing G796D-positive
clones under selection pressure of osimertinib (Figure 5).
Previously, G796C/D/R were demonstrated to
render resistance to erlotinib and CI-1033 in Ba/F3 cell
system through a random mutagenesis screening approach
[36]. The impact was more dramatic on CI-1033, a panErbB inhibitor that forms a covalent bond with EGFR
C797 residue [37]. The GI50 increased 10- and 100-fold
for erlotinib and CI-1033, respectively, in G796R mutant
line compared with Ba/F3 cells expressing wildtype
EGFR [36]. G796D could induce resistance to osimertinib
by interfering with osimertinib-EGFR interaction due
to steric hindrance around C797 residue, the covalent
binding site for the inhibitor. We noted that G796D is
resistant to gefitinib as well as erlotinib (Supplementary
Figure 4), albeit to a less extent. However, G796Dpositive cells remained as minority of population upon
gefitinib PD. We reasoned that it was probably because
G796D is a milder mutation comparing to L858R/T790M.
Therefore, L858R/T790M-positive population presented
as the dominant force of tumor growth at gefitinib
resistance, and G796D-positve cells only emerged as
majority after L858R/T790M-positive clones were
diminished by osimertinib (Figure 5).
To our knowledge, all the EGFR mutations previously
reported to drive resistance to osimertinib or rociletinib,
such as L718Q, C797S and L798I, were identified with
T790M concurrently [22–24, 34], while G796D is found
in the absence of T790M context. Hence this is the sole
case by far of EGFR mutation-dependent mechanism
causing intrinsic resistance to osimertinib. G796A/D/S
mutations were reported in TKI-naive lung adenocarcinoma
patients, either alone or in combination with exon 19
deletion [38–40], supporting that it can exist as a de novo
oncogenic mutation. Consistently, in our case, G796D was

identified together with L858R at pre-gefitinib, as a minor,
independent clone. It remains to be seen whether G796D
can also present as an acquired resistance mutation.
In conclusion, we have identified a case of Chinese
NSCLC patient with intrinsic EGFR G796D mutation
that led to resistance to osimertinib. The loss of T790Mpositive clones and selection of pre-existing G796Dpositive clones suggest that genomic heterogeneity
contributes to clonal evolution which ultimately results in
the emergence of drug resistance during treatment journey.
Our findings highlight the needs for development of new
targeted therapies and combination strategies dynamically
adjusted based on real-time monitored genomic analysis
throughout the entirety of disease course.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient information
Patient246 was diagnosed with advanced NSCLC
at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital in June 2011. The study
was approved by the hospital research ethics committee
and the patient had signed the informed consent form.
Serial plasma samples were collected at time points of pregefitinib, gefitinib PD and osimertinib PD. Whole blood
were obtained at osimertinib PD. Tumor responses were
assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria In
Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

Extraction of genomic DNA and plasma cell-free
DNA (cfDNA)
Genomic DNA from whole blood was extracted
using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma samples
were prepared and stored as described previously [33].
cfDNA was extracted with QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Figure 5: Tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution. A conceptual model showing that the tumor was genomically heterogeneous,

comprising of both L858R-positive and G796D-positive populations, with the former as the major clone. Upon gefitinib resistance, L858Rpositive cells acquired the secondary T790M mutation and became the dominant driver of tumor growth. These L858R/T790M-positive
tumor cells were then inhibited by osimertinib, whereas pre-existing G796D-positive clones, which are resistant to osimertinib, gradually
made up the majority of the population.

Next-generation panel sequencing

The absorbance was measured at 490 nm wavelength
using 650 nm as reference on Tecan Spark 20M (Tecan
Group Ltd., Zurich, Switzerland). The data was processed
and plotted using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Indexed Illumina NGS libraries were prepared
from plasma cfDNA and fragmented genomic DNA
using KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn,
MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Ligation was performed at 4°C overnight using adapters
from SeqCap Adapter Kit (Roche NimbleGen, Madison,
WI, USA). The indexed libraries were captured using
a customized SeqCap EZ Choice Library (Roche
NimbleGen) covering 403 genes (Supplementary Table 1).
Hybrid selection, washing, recovery, amplification and
purification of captured multiplex DNA samples were
performed using SeqCap EZ system (Roche NimbleGen).
The amplified products were then purified with QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), and multiplexed libraries
sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq X10 platform with
150-bp paired-end reads according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The raw average sequence depth was >7000× for
plasma cfDNA samples and ~2800× for the genomic DNA
from whole blood.

Modulation of signal pathways
Ba/F3 cells harboring various EGFR mutants were
starved in RPMI1640 for 4 hours, pre-treated with 1 uM
gefitinib or osimertinib for 2 hours, and then stimulated
by 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 minutes in serum-free medium.
Cells were collected, washed once in cold PBS and
lysed in 2×SDS lysis buffer [100 mM Tris pH6.8, 4%
SDS, 20% glycerol, and 1× protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Pierce | Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA)]. The lysates were boiled at 100oC for
10 minutes, and protein concentration was quantified
by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Equal amount of
protein was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane using iBolt (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), and subjected to immunoblotting analysis
with indicated antibodies according to manufacturers’
instructions.

Bioinformatics data analysis
BWA [41] was employed for mapping the pairend reads to human reference genome hg19, samblaster
[42] for marking duplicate reads, and VarDict [43] for
detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small
insertions and deletions (indels). SNVs and small indels
were called with the criteria of allele frequency ≥ 0.5%
and at least two supporting reads after deduplication.
Variant calls of interest were manually inspected in IGV
[44, 45].
