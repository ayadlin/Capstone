Abstract
A major contributor to cancer mortality is recurrence and subsequent metastatic transformation following
therapeutic intervention. Therefore, in order to develop new treatment modalities and improve the efﬁcacy of
current ones, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that promote resistance to therapy in cancer
cells. One pathway contributing to therapy resistance is autophagy, a self-digestive process that can eliminate
unnecessary or damaged organelles to protect cancer cells from death. We have found that the VEGF-C/NRP-2 axis is
involved in the activation of autophagy, which helps cancer cell survival following treatment. Inhibition of mTOR
complex 1 activity by this axis is the underlying mechanism for the activation of autophagy. Furthermore, we
identiﬁed two VEGF-C/NRP-2-regulated genes, LAMP-2 and WDFY-1, that have previously been suggested to
participate in autophagy and vesicular trafﬁcking. Upregulation of WDFY-1 following VEGF-C or NRP-2 depletion
contributes to cytotoxic drug-mediated cell death. Together, these data suggest a link between the VEGF-C/NRP-2
axis and cancer cell survival despite the presence of chemotherapy-induced stress. Effective targeting of this pathway
may lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Cancer Res; 73(1); 160–71. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
A delicate balance between cell survival and cell death is
crucial for maintaining normal physiologic homeostasis. This
balance is dysregulated in cancer cells via alterations in pathways
regulating apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, which constitutes
an important mechanism of therapeutic resistance. The recurrence of cancer after therapy arises from a subset of cells that
acquire the ability to survive during therapeutic stress. These
cells also show enhanced metastatic properties and lead to
cancer mortality (1). A key mechanism that confers stress
tolerance and enables cancer cells to survive under stress is
macroautophagy, most commonly known as autophagy (2, 3).

Autophagy is a regulated catabolic pathway that promotes
lysosomal degradation of damaged proteins, cellular organelles, and other macromolecules (4–9). This self-digestion
process, which facilitates the recycling of bioenergetic components, is activated by a number of stimuli, including the
presence of reactive oxygen species, deprivation of growth
factors, DNA damage, and cytotoxic drugs (10–12). Autophagy
dysregulation is associated with a number of disease states,
including cancer (6, 12, 13). Autophagy plays different roles
during the initiation and progression of cancer (2, 14, 15). While
autophagy acts as a tumor suppressor during the initiation
phase of cancer, it promotes tumor progression and metastasis
in established cancers (2, 16). Metastatic cancer cells that
usually grow in a nutrient-poor microenvironment use autophagy to fulﬁll their high metabolic demand. Autophagy can
facilitate survival during anchorage-independent growth or
anoikis, and promotes therapeutic resistance (17, 18). Furthermore, a recent study indicated that genetic or pharmacologic
inhibition of autophagy sensitized tumor cells to anticancer
treatment (19). During therapy resistance, autophagy protects
cancer cells from necrotic death by removing organelles damaged by treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs (2). Autophagy has been shown to be a survival mechanism in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells (20–22). Additionally, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells display high basal levels
of autophagy, which contributes to their intrinsic treatment
resistance (23).
VEGF-C, a member of the VEGF family of proteins, induces
the formation of new lymphatic vessels, a process known as
lymphangiogenesis (24). VEGF-C binds to a heterodimer,
consisting of 1 of 2 tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGFR3 or
VEGFR2) and a nontyrosine kinase receptor, neuropilin-2

VEGF-C Axis Promotes Autophagy

(NRP-2), on lymphatic endothelial cells (25–27). Notably,
VEGF-C has lymphangiogenesis-independent functions. For
example, VEGF-C is often overexpressed in glioblastoma
patients, although brain tissue is void of lymphatics. VEGFC is also a trophic factor for neural progenitors in vertebrate
embryonic brain (28); and can stimulate the proliferation and
survival of leukemic cells (29, 30), proliferation and migration
of Kaposi sarcoma cells (31), and the invasion and metastasis of
gastric, breast, and lung cancer cells (31–33).
Previously, we observed the expression of NRP-2 in cancer
cells, suggesting an autocrine function of the VEGF-C/NRP-2
axis (34). Interestingly, we found that this axis can protect
prostate and pancreatic cancer cells during chemotherapeutic
stress by activating autophagy. Additionally, we have found
evidence that inhibition of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1)
activity by the VEGF-C/NRP-2 axis is a potential mechanism
through which autophagy is induced in cancer cells for therapy
resistance. These ﬁndings, therefore, provide a novel mechanism through which the VEGF-C/NRP-2 axis protects cancer
cells from chemotherapy-induced stress.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 (American Type
Culture Collection, ATCC), LNCaP C4-2, LNCaP C4-2B, and
Du145 as well as the pancreatic cancer cell line, CaPan-1
(ATCC), were cultured at 37 C either in RPMI-1640 with Lglutamine (Invitrogen) or in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (CellGro) media supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen)
and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Stably transfected
PC3 cell lines were grown in the presence of 1 mg/mL puromycin selection. PC3 and DU145 were purchased from the
ATCC within the last 2 years. CaPan-1 cell line was received
from Dr. Tony Hollingsworth's laboratory at the University of
Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), Omaha, Nebraska. STR
proﬁling of CaPan-1 was carried out at UNMC with PowerPlex
16 System (Promega). An ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems) was used for the proﬁling. The DNA proﬁle data
was cross-checked with the ATCC data bank.
Cell transfections and treatment with function-blocking
antibodies
Cells were transfected with siRNAs against VEGF-C (Dharmacon RNA Technologies and Qiagen), NRP-2, VEGF-A,
LAMP-2, and WDFY-1 (Dharmacon RNA Technologies) using
DharmaFECT 1-4 (Dharmacon RNA Technologies). siRNA
transfection was allowed to proceed 48 to 72 hours before
collection of whole-cell extract or total RNA. Alternatively, cells
were treated for 48 hours with 4 mg of antihuman VEGF-C
(AF752; R&D Systems) or soluble rhNRP-2-Fc fused protein
(2215-N2; R&D Systems). The mature form of GFP-mCherryLC3-expressing plasmid was transfected into PC3 cells using
Effectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Qiagen). Colonies were selected under puromycin
selection pressure. Stable clones of PC3 expressing varying
levels of GFP-mCherry-LC3 were isolated for subsequent
experiments. Rapamycin (100 nmol/L; Sigma) was added to

www.aacrjournals.org

the cells 48 hours after transfection. Cells were harvested 24
hours after rapamycin addition.
mRNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was prepared
from approximately 1 mg mRNA by Transcriptor First Strand
Synthesis Kit (Roche) with random hexamer primer. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses were carried out in
an Applied Biosystems machine using Power SYBR Green
master mix following our previously published protocol (35;
for details, please see supplementary material).
Detailed description of the microarray analysis has been
provided in the supplementary material.
Western blot and ELISA
Western blots were conducted using antibodies against
LAMP-2 (The Developmental Hybridoma Bank, University
of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa), Akt, pAkt (Ser473), LC3, pS6K (Ser
389), S6K (Cell Signaling), NRP-2, and rho-GDI (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), ATG13, WDFY-1 (GeneTex), b-actin (Sigma),
and pATG13 (Ser318) (Rockland Immunochemicals).
Secreted VEGF-C in conditioned media was analyzed using
an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Inc.) according to manufacturer's
protocol.
Apoptosis assay and confocal microscopy
Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit #7, purchased from Molecular
Probes (Invitrogen), was used according to the manufacturer's
protocol. Brieﬂy, PC3, Du145, and CaPan-1 cells were seeded at
a density of 1.5  105 cells per well of a 2-well chamber slide
(LabTek). VEGF-C, NRP-2, WDFY-1, and LAMP-2 were depleted and, 24 hours later, the cells were treated with docetaxel
(5, 10, or 20 nmol/L doses) for prostate cancer cell lines and
gemcitabine (20 nmol/L) for pancreatic cancer cell lines; 48
hours later, baﬁlomycin A1 (BAFM, 10 nmol/L; Sigma) was
added. After 24 hours of BAFM treatment, adherent cells were
incubated with 1 mL of Hoechst 33342, YO-PRO-1, and propidium iodide (PI) at room temperature for 15 minutes. The cells
were then viewed under a confocal microscope using appropriate ﬁlters. The apoptotic cells were stained with green
ﬂuorescent YO-PRO-1 dye and the dead cells were stained
with red ﬂuorescent PI dye. The blue ﬂuorescent dye, Hoechst
33342, stains the chromatin of the cells. Experiments were
repeated at least 3 times. A t test was conducted with the data
sets obtained to determine whether the differences between
experimental groups were signiﬁcant (P  0.05).
To determine the autophagic activity, stably transfected
PC3 cells were grown on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips (BD
Biosciences). VEGF-C and NRP-2 were depleted 72 hours
before cell ﬁxation. BAFM and docetaxel at the concentrations listed above were added. At the end of the experiment,
the cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and counterstained with 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Respective ﬁlters were used to image red and green LC-3II puncta.
All confocal images were captured using a Zeiss 710 Confocal
Laser Scanning Microscope equipped with 4 lasers, and images
analyzed using Zeiss Zen 2010 software. For quantiﬁcation, the

regulates autophagy. Depletion of VEGF-C was conﬁrmed by
both ELISA and qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B), while
NRP-2 depletion was conﬁrmed by both qPCR and Western
blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D).
VEGF-C and NRP-2 promote the activation of autophagy
following stress
Starvation of cells initiates autophagy (12); therefore, we
examined the effects of starvation on autophagy in VEGF-C–
depleted PC3 cells. During autophagy induction, microtubuleassociated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) becomes posttranslationally modiﬁed by phosphatidyl ethanolamine and is
incorporated into the membrane of the forming autophagosomes. Detection of this lipidated version of LC3 (LC3-II) by
Western blot is frequently used in the laboratory to monitor
autophagy (12). We monitored the level of LC3-II protein via
Western blotting in PC3 cells following starvation in PBS at
various time points. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, following VEGF-C
depletion, the basal LC3-II level increased compared with
controls (scrambled siRNA-treated cells). LC3-II accumulation
was maximal at the 1-hour time interval in VEGF-C–depleted
samples. Increases in WDFY-1 and LAMP-2 levels were
detected following VEGF-C depletion at every time point (data
not shown). This increase in LC3-II level does not necessarily
represent an enhanced autophagic activation, as LC3-II is
eventually degraded by the lysosome during autophagy. Therefore, LC3-II accumulates in a time-dependent manner when
autophagy is inhibited as a result of decreased lysosomal
degradation. To determine whether VEGF-C depletion induces
or inhibits autophagy, we conducted autophagic ﬂux experiments. In this assay, the degradation of LC3-II is inhibited
by treatment with BAFM, which prevents the fusion of the
autophagosome with the lysosome. The fold-change in LC3-II

Results
Disruption of the VEGF-C/NRP-2 axis alters the
expression of autophagy-related genes in prostate
cancer cells
We previously observed that the expression of VEGF-C and
NRP-2 promoted the survival of prostate cancer cells following
treatment with H2O2 (34). To identify potential pathways
involved in this VEGF-C-mediated cell survival, we conducted
a microarray study in PC3 prostate cancer cells depleted of
either VEGF-C or NRP-2 using SmartPool siRNAs and with
scrambled siRNA as a control (Detailed microarray data at
GEOarchive, Geo accession number GSE36085; NCBI tracking
system number 16273855; ref. 36). We found 34 gene-tags that
were commonly up- or downregulated in both NRP-2- and
VEGF-C–depleted cells. A subset of 10 genes was validated via
quantitative PCR (qPCR; Fig. 1A). Two genes, LAMP-2 and
WDFY-1, were studied in-depth, on the basis of previous reports
of function and cellular localization of the proteins. LAMP-2
plays an important role in autophagy by facilitating the fusion
of autophagosomes to lysosomes (37). WDFY-1 participates in
vesicular trafﬁcking (38) and shares homology with WDFY-3,
which participates in aggrephagy, a selective process that
degrades protein aggregates using the autophagy machinery
(39). We found that both the LAMP-2 and WDFY-1 proteins
were upregulated in PC3 cells following VEGF-C/NRP-2 depletion (Fig. 1, B, and C). Because both these proteins are involved
in autophagy, we hypothesized that the VEGF-C/NRP-2 axis

Figure 2. The effects of VEGF-C/NRP-2 depletion and starvation on autophagy. Following the depletion of VEGF-C or NRP-2, cells were maintained in PBS for
30, 60, 90, and 150 minutes. Following incubation in PBS, cells were lysed. A, immunoblots were carried out to examine the level of LC3-II. B, in order
to gauge the amount of autophagic ﬂux occurring in the cells, the level of LC3-II in cells treated with Baﬁlomycin A1 (BAFM) was compared with the level
of LC3-II in untreated cells. Immunoblot analysis is shown (right). The density of these bands was calculated and the ratio of LC3-II in BAFM-treated
cells was divided by LC3-II in untreated cells. This value is illustrated graphically (left). C, autophagic ﬂux analysis in starved, NRP-2–depleted cells.

levels in each experimental condition in the presence or
absence of BAFM was calculated. A higher fold-change in
LC3-II level in a particular condition compared with control
suggests an induction of autophagy and a lower fold-change
suggests an inhibition of autophagy (13, 40, 41). We found that
VEGF-C depletion blocked autophagic ﬂux as the fold-change
in LC3-II in VEGF-C depleted prostate cancer cells after BAFM
treatment was reduced compared with the fold-change in
control cells (Fig. 2B). We also found a similar decrease in
autophagic ﬂux following NRP-2 depletion and nutrient deprivation (Fig. 2C). Overall, these results indicated that the
depletion of the VEGF-C axis dysregulates autophagy.
VEGF-C depletion in the presence of therapeutic stress led
to a dysregulation of autophagy similar to that observed during
starvation. We used docetaxel, which is commonly used to
treat patients with metastatic prostate cancer, at different
doses (5, 10, and 20 nmol/L) to induce autophagy. Reduced
autophagic ﬂux was observed in docetaxel-treated PC3 cells
following VEGF-C depletion with smart-pool siRNA cocktail
(Fig. 3A) or with 2 individual VEGF-C speciﬁc siRNAs (Fig. 3B).
Similar to cocktail siRNA, the individual siRNAs also signiﬁcantly inhibited VEGF-C expression (Supplementary Fig. S2A
and B) and were capable of increasing the expression of LAMP2 and WDFY-1 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). NRP-2 depletion in
docetaxel-treated PC3 cells also led to an inhibition of autophagy (Fig. 3C). We repeated the autophagic-ﬂux experiment in
PC-3 cells using function-blocking antibody against VEGF-C

www.aacrjournals.org

(anti-human VEGF-C; AF752; R&D Systems). Similar to
VEGF-C siRNA, the blocking antibody inhibited the autophagic ﬂux in the presence of docetaxel (Fig. 3D). NRP-2
function was speciﬁcally inhibited by using soluble NRP-2-Fc
fused protein. This soluble chimeric protein competes with
the membrane bound receptor for ligand binding and, therefore, inhibits its function. We again observed a decrease in
autophagic ﬂux in docetaxel-treated PC-3 cells following addition of soluble NRP-2-Fc protein (Fig. 3E). Combined, these
results suggest the VEGF-C/NRP-2 axis is involved in autophagy maintenance in cancer cells during therapeutic stress.
To conﬁrm that the depletion of VEGF-C or NRP-2 prevents
autophagic trafﬁcking, PC3 cells stably expressing a mCherryGFP-LC3 construct were transfected with VEGF-C or NRP-2
siRNAs, incubated with docetaxel for 48 hours, and imaged via
confocal microscopy. Following autophagic initiation red,
yellow, or green LC3 punctae are visible (13). While yellow or
green puncta correspond to autophagosomes, as the autophagosomes mature and fuse with the lysosomes (autolysosome),
only red puncta should be visible as GFP is acid-labile, and the
lysosomal lumen is highly acidiﬁed. As shown in Fig. 3F, we saw
both small green/yellow puncta as well as large, red, perinuclear structures indicative of autophagic activity in control
cells. In VEGF-C- and NRP-2–depleted cells, however, we
observed only diffuse green staining or green puncta, indicating a decrease in autolysosomal turnover and, therefore, an
inhibition of autophagy. When we calculated the ratio between

to GFP was calculated and used to determine the amount of LC3 found in later autophagic structures and lysosomes (mCherry-positive) compared with early
autophagosomes (GFP-positive).

the red and green ﬂuorescence intensities (a measure of
autophagy activity) in 20 randomly selected ﬁelds for control
and VEGF-C-/NRP-2–depleted cells (Fig. 3G), we found a
decrease in the ratio of red to green, which validated our
previous results. Representative images for Fig. 3G are shown
in Supplementary Fig. S3. Interestingly VEGF-A, which is
functionally redundant with VEGF-C in the regulation of
lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis (42), does not regulate
autophagy in PC3 during therapeutic stress. We did not
observe any increase in WDFY-1 and LAMP-2 in PC3 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4A) and no change in autophagic ﬂux
in docetaxel-treated PC3 cells following VEGF-A-depletion
(Supplementary Fig. S4B–D). These results emphasize

the speciﬁcity of the VEGF-C axis in regulating autophagy
during stress.
To conﬁrm that the results we obtained in PC3 cells are
neither cell-line nor tumor-type speciﬁc, we repeated the

Gemcitabine is frequently used to treat pancreatic cancer
patients. We found a decrease in autophagic ﬂux following
VEGF-C depletion compared with control cells, suggesting that
VEGF-C depletion dysregulates autophagy initiated by cytotoxic drugs. NRP-2 depletion in gemcitabine-treated CaPan-1

Figure 4. The consequence of VEGF-C/NRP-2 depletion or autophagic blockade and subsequent drug treatment on cell viability. VEGF-C or NRP-2
were depleted from PC3 for either 72 or 48 hours before treatment with a 10 nmol/L dose of docetaxel. The cells were then stained with YoPro, propidium iodide
(PI), and Hoechst 33342. A, cells were visualized at 63 using an LSM 710 microscope with appropriate ﬁlters. Three representative images for each
treatment are shown (left). In order to quantify the amount of cell death caused by each treatment, the total number of green, red, and hybrid cells were counted
in 10 randomly selected ﬁelds and divided by the number of Hoechst-positive cells. The results of this analysis for PC3 cells treated with scrambled- or
VEGF-C-sIRNA in the presence and absence of docetaxel are shown (right). B, cell death analysis in NRP-2–depleted cells treated with 20 and
50 nmol/L doses of docetaxel for 72 hours. C, the resulting cell death in PC3 cells treated with scrambled- or NRP-2 siRNA following treatment with a
10 nmol/L dose of docetaxel for 48 hours. D and E, cell death analysis in PC3 cells treated with VEGF-C function-blocking antibody or soluble
NRP-2-Fc chimera and a 10 nmol/L dose of docetaxel for 48 hours. F, cells were treated with a 10 nmol/L dose of docetaxel. Twenty-four hours before
staining and confocal microscopy, a 10 nmol/L dose of BAFM was added to the cells. G, the effect of BAFM treatment on the survival of LNCapC4-2B cells

ﬁelds. Cell death experiments were repeated no fewer than 3 times. In all samples, standard deviation within the data sets is shown. Furthermore, a t test
was used to determine whether variation between experimental groups reached statistical signiﬁcance (P  0.05).

cells dysregulated autophagy similarly (Supplementary Fig.
S5B). Similar to PC-3 cells, the VEGF-C function-blocking
antibody (Supplementary Fig. 5C, left) and soluble NRP-2-Fc
chimera (Supplementary Fig. S5C, right) also inhibited autophagic ﬂux in CaPan-1 cells and, therefore, conﬁrmed the siRNA
results. Overall, these data indicate that autophagic activation
by the VEGF-C axis acts as a generalized stress response in
cancer cells and may be responsible for their survival following
chemotherapy treatment.
VEGF-C and NRP-2 depletion in cancer cells promotes
enhanced cell death following chemotherapy
To assess whether VEGF-C depletion promotes cancer cell
death, VEGF-C–depleted PC3 cells and control cells were
treated with docetaxel for 48 hours before staining with YoPro, Hoechst 33342, and PI and subsequent confocal imaging.

www.aacrjournals.org

Representative images of control and VEGF-C–depleted PC3
cells are shown in Fig. 4A, left. To quantify the amount of dead
and dying cells, the numbers of green, red, and hybrid red-green
cells were counted in 10 different ﬁelds and these numbers
were divided by the numbers of blue cells per ﬁeld (Fig. 4A,
right). We observed enhanced cell death in untreated VEGF-C–
depleted cells compared with controls and the addition
of docetaxel signiﬁcantly increased the amount of cell death
in VEGF-C–depleted cells compared with control cells
(P, 0.00584). Similar results were observed in NRP-2–depleted
PC3 cells (Figs. 4B and C and Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7).
Interestingly, we observed increased cell death in untreated
PC3 cells following NRP-2 depletion than those in which VEGFC was depleted (Figs, 4A and B). Because NRP-2 is a receptor,
we believe its depletion exerts greater downstream effect than
VEGF-C and, thus, a greater consequence to the survival of the

vated the VEGF-C/NRP-2 axis in both LNCaP C4-2B and
LNCaP C4-2 cell lines. As expected, the overexpression of
VEGF-C induced autophagy and protected the cells from
docetaxel-induced death (Figs. 4G and H and Supplementary
Figs. S9A and B and S10). NRP-2 depletion in either cell line
prevented VEGF-C-dependent rescue of cell survival. The
survival of C4-2B and C4-2 cells due to VEGF-C overexpression was also completely abolished when autophagy was
inhibited via treatment with the autophagy inhibitor, BAFM.
These results, therefore, suggest that VEGF-C/NRP-2 axisdependent autophagy is required for its survival-promoting
function during chemotherapeutic stress. This conclusion
was again validated in PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S11).
Increased cell survival was observed in VEGF-C siRNAtreated PC3 cells, when VEGF-C was exogenously overexpressed. This rescue of cell survival was not detected following autophagy inhibition by BAFM treatment. Thus, we
conclude that the cell death we observed in VEGF-C- and
NRP-2–depleted cells treated with docetaxel is due to an
inhibition of autophagy.
To show that autophagic activation by the VEGF-C axis was
a general mechanism of tumor cell survival, we repeated the
cell-survival experiments in Du145 cells as well as in CaPan-1
cells. In both cell lines, we observed a statistically signiﬁcant
decrease in survival following VEGF-C depletion and subsequent treatment with chemotherapeutic agents compared
with treated control cells (Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary
Figs. S12 and S13). Similarly, NRP-2 depletion in CaPan-1 cells
also leads to increased cell death following gemcitabine treatment (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S14). Again, increase in
cell death was observed when CaPan-1 cells were treated with

PC-3 cells. Therefore, to observe a further increase in cell death
in NRP-2–depleted PC3 cells following docetaxel treatment,
doses of docetaxel greater than 10 nmol/L (Fig. 4B) or the
depletion of NRP-2 for shorter time period (48 hours instead
of 72 hours; Fig. 4C) was required. Similar increases in cell
death were observed when the function of VEGF-C or NRP-2
was inhibited in PC-3 cells by VEGF-C function-blocking
antibody (Fig. 4D) or soluble NRP-2-Fc chimera (Fig. 4E). As
such, these data indicate that signaling from the VEGF-C/
NRP-2 axis protects cancer cells from therapy-induced
stress. To determine whether autophagy is involved in the
response of cancer cells to docetaxel treatment, PC3 cells
were incubated with docetaxel, BAFM, or both agents.
Autophagic inhibition by BAFM was conﬁrmed by analyzing
mCherry-GFP-LC3-expressing cells using confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S8A). We observed a signiﬁcant
(P, 0.0345) increase in cell death following treatment with
both docetaxel and BAFM (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig.
S8B), although we did not observe a signiﬁcant increase in
cell death following docetaxel treatment alone. Overall, the
extent of cell death was similar to that observed in VEGF-Cor NRP-2–depleted cells. To further show that the VEGF-C
axis-regulated autophagy is important for docetaxel resistance, we conducted the following experiments. We overexpressed VEGF-C in LNCaP C4-2B and LNCaP C4-2 cells.
LNCaP C4-2B is a variant of LNCaP C4-2 cells, which is
capable of metastasizing to the bone. These cells express low
levels of endogenous VEGF-C. Interestingly, LNCaP C4-2B
expresses similar endogenous level of NRP-2 to PC3. The C42 expresses detectable level of NRP-2 although lower than
both C4-2B and PC3. By overexpressing VEGF-C, we acti-

VEGF-C function-blocking antibody or NRP-2 Fc chimera
along with gemcitabine (Supplementary Fig. S15A and B).
These data indicate that the VEGF-C axis promotes autophagy,
which contributes to survival in cancer cells exposed to
cytotoxic stress.
Upregulation of WDFY-1 following VEGF-C and NRP-2
depletion contributes to decreased cell viability in
chemotherapy-treated cells
We previously showed that LAMP-2 and WDFY-1 levels
increased following VEGF-C and NRP-2 depletion (Fig. 1). We
observed a similar increase in LAMP-2 and WDFY-1 following
inhibition of autophagy by BAFM treatment in all cell lines
(Fig. 6A). We, therefore, concluded that the upregulation of
WDFY-1 and LAMP-2 occur when autophagy is inhibited
through an inhibitory mechanism. Next, we tested whether
increases in the levels of WDFY-1 and LAMP-2 inﬂuence the
survival of cancer cells following therapeutic intervention. We
found that VEGF-C depletion led to a signiﬁcant (P, 0.015)
increase in cell death following docetaxel treatment. Intriguingly, the codepletion of VEGF-C and WDFY-1, which we
veriﬁed by Western blot (Fig. 6B), maintains cell viability
following docetaxel treatment (Fig. 6C and Supplementary
Fig. S16). Enhanced cell viability was also observed in PC3
cells codepleted of NRP-2 and WDFY-1 following docetaxel
treatment compared to PC3 cells depleted of NRP-2 alone (Fig.
6D and Supplementary Fig. S16). Similarly, the depletion of
both LAMP-2 and VEGF-C also led to a decrease in cell death
compared with the depletion of VEGF-C alone (data not

shown), although we did not ﬁnd that this difference was
statistically signiﬁcant. Together, these results suggest that
increased levels of WDFY-1 and LAMP-2 (to a lesser extent)
promote cell death following the inhibition of autophagy.
Inactivation of mTORC1 activity by the VEGF-C/NRP-2
axis is a potential mechanism for autophagy induction
We have shown that the accumulation of WDFY-1 and
LAMP-2 driven by the depletion of VEGF-C and NRP-2 in
cancer cells (Figs. 6A) might be a consequence of autophagic
inhibition. These results, therefore, indicated that these proteins might not regulate autophagy in cancer cells downstream
of the VEGF-C axis. In search of the potential mechanisms
through which the VEGF-C axis regulates stress-induced
autophagy, we turned our attention to our previously reported
ﬁndings. Earlier, we showed that during oxidative stress the
VEGF-C axis maintains mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) activity,
which is upstream of AKT (34). Interestingly, the downstream
mediators of the AKT-mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling
axis, the S6 protein or 4EBP (43), were not activated under
these conditions in prostate cancer cells. The reason for this
unexpected result remained unanswered in our previous publication (34). As active mTORC1 blocks the induction of
autophagy (9), we hypothesized that the VEGF-C/NRP-2 axis
actually inhibits mTORC1 activity to promote autophagy during stress (44). Indeed, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in
phospho-S6K following the depletion of either VEGF-C or NRP2 in PC-3 (Fig. 7A) or a decrease in phospho-S6K level in
docetaxel-treated LNCaP C4-2 cells (34) following addition of

VEGF-C (Supplementary Fig. S17A and B), suggesting an
inhibitory role of VEGF-C axis on mTORC1 activity. This
increase in S6K phosphorylation on VEGF-C depletion seemed
to be independent of AKT as knocking down the AKT level did
not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence phospho-S6K levels (Supplementary Fig. S17C). A decrease in ATG13 phosphorylation following
the depletion of VEGF-C or NRP-2 in PC3 treated with docetaxel was observed (Fig. 7A). Downregulation of ATG13 was
regulated by mTORC1 for the inhibition of autophagy. To
further conﬁrm that this increased mTORC1 activity is responsible for the observed dysregulation of autophagy, we used
rapamycin to block mTORC1 activity in VEGF-C- and NRP-2–
depleted PC3 cells. Rapamycin treatment rescued the autophagic ﬂux in PC3 cells despite decreased levels of VEGF-C and
NRP-2 (Fig. 7B). Similar results were obtained when we monitored autophagy by confocal microscopy in the docetaxeltreated stably expressing mCherry-GFP-LC3 PC3 cell line (Fig.

7C). An increased number of mCherry-positive red punctae
of autolysosomes, indicative of increased autophagy, were
observed in VEGF-C or NRP-2–depleted PC3 cells following
treatment with rapamycin. A similar decrease in ATG13 activity and an upregulation of pS6K activity following the inhibition of the VEGF-C/NRP-2 axis was also observed in CaPan-1
cells (Fig. 7D). Rapamycin also restored the autophagic ﬂux in
CaPan-1 cells, despite the depletion of VEGF-C or NRP-2 (Fig.
7E and F). We, therefore, conclude that the VEGF-C/NRP-2 axis
promotes autophagy via downregulation of mTORC1 function
especially during therapeutic stress.

Discussion
The ability of tumor cells to survive under stress is a major
obstacle to effective cancer therapy (1, 19). Autophagy has been
shown to promote cancer cell survival in the presence of
metabolic, hypoxic, or cytotoxic stress (6, 12) that can result

in tumor dormancy and subsequent progression and metastasis
(2, 17). Previously, we reported a survival-promoting function of
the VEGF-C axis during oxidative stress (34). Our subsequent
studies suggested that the VEGF-C axis can regulate distinct
cellular mechanisms to facilitate the survival of cancer cells
under different stress conditions. A clue that the VEGF-C/NRP2 axis regulates autophagy in cancer cells came from a microarray study to identify genes that are regulated by this axis. We
knocked down endogenous VEGF-C and NRP-2 separately in
prostate cancer cells and identiﬁed genes whose expression was
inﬂuenced by reduced levels of endogenous VEGF-C and NRP-2.
We identiﬁed 10 genes that were equally up- or downregulated
following the depletion either VEGF-C or NRP-2 and considered
them as the genes regulated by VEGF-C axis in prostate cancer.
Interestingly, most of these genes are similarly regulated by
VEGF-C or NRP-2 in other cancer cells, which suggests the
importance of this axis in different cancers. Among these genes,
we took particular interest in WDFY-1 and LAMP-2 (Fig. 1).
LAMP-2 is a lysosomal membrane protein, which plays a role in
autophagy (36). WDFY-1 (also known as FENS-1), which contains a single FYVE domain and multiple WD40 repeats, plays a
role in vesicular trafﬁcking (37). Interestingly, a related protein
WDFY-3 (ALFY) is involved in selective autophagy (aggrephagy;
ref. 38), suggesting a potential connection between WDFY-1 and
autophagy. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that the VEGFC/NRP-2 axis regulates autophagy and that WDFY-1 and
LAMP-2 function as downstream effectors in this pathway.
The experimental proof of this hypothesis came from studies
where we tested autophagic activity in VEGF-C- or NRP-2–
depleted PC3 cells during nutrient deprivation (Fig. 2) and
observed an autophagy-inducing function by both VEGF-C and
NRP-2. To our knowledge, this is a novel observation and
underscores the importance of this axis in cancer stressresistance. It has been postulated by researchers in this ﬁeld
that autophagy and apoptosis are mutually exclusive (10).
Because autophagy is viewed as primarily cytoprotective, it
has been hypothesized that its induction should be coupled
with the activation of antiapoptotic pathways (10). Our previous study on the function of the VEGF-C axis in cancer
validates this hypothesis (34). We previously showed that the
VEGF-C axis activates mTORC2 and promotes cancer cell
survival during stress through the activation of antiapoptotic
pathways. Our current study suggests that this axis also controls autophagy. We, therefore, propose that due to its ability to
couple autophagy and antiapoptotic pathways, the VEGF-C/
NRP-2 axis is a signiﬁcant pathway in promoting cancer cell
survival during stress.
We then examined the interaction between the VEGF-C axis
and autophagy in the presence of docetaxel-induced cytotoxic
stress. Docetaxel has been used to treat patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (45) and independent clinical trials have shown that docetaxel-based treatment
can increase median overall survival compared with mitoxantrone and prednisone (46, 47). Docetaxel functions by stabilizing microtubules, thereby inhibiting mitotic spindle depolymerization and cell proliferation. Docetaxel also induces cell
death by inhibiting various cell-survival mechanisms. The cell
death-inducing function of docetaxel may be therapeutically

more signiﬁcant in prostate cancer as this cancer usually
proliferates at a slower rate, and lethality of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is due to its ability to resist
death (45). Resistance to docetaxel in men with metastatic
castration-resistant disease has been observed in almost 50%
of patients. Accordingly, we determined whether the autophagy-inducing activity of the VEGF-C axis in prostate cancer
cells is responsible for its ability to resist docetaxel-induced cell
death. In VEGF-C- and NRP-2–depleted cells treated with
docetaxel, we observed decrease in autophagic ﬂux compared
with control cells (Fig. 3A–E). We have conﬁrmed this observation morphologically using mCherry-GFP-LC3-expressing
cells (Fig. 3F and G). As expected, the depletion of VEGF-C
and NRP-2 in PC3 cells also made them more vulnerable to
docetaxel-induced death (Fig. 4A–E; Supplementary Figs. S6
and S7). A similar increase in cell death was observed when PC3
cells were treated with docetaxel and, at the same time,
autophagy was inhibited chemically (Fig. 4F; Supplementary
Figs. S8A, B, and S11). Furthermore, the addition of VEGF-C to
LNCaP C4-2B and C4-2 cells failed to rescue cell survival
following autophagy inhibition (Fig. 4G and H; Supplementary
Figs. S9 and S10). These results indicate a VEGF-C/NRP-2dependent mechanism of docetaxel resistance in prostate
cancer. Because both VEGF-C and NRP-2 are expressed in
high levels in metastatic prostate cancer (48, 49), we assume
that this axis could contribute to prostate cancer recurrence
following docetaxel treatment.
To prove that our observation was not a cell-type speciﬁc
phenomenon, we conducted similar experiments in another
prostate cancer cell line, Du145, as well as in a pancreatic
cancer cell line, CaPan-1. We selected these lines because of
their aggressive nature, metastatic potential, and high endogenous expression of both VEGF-C and NRP-2 (data not
shown). We treated CaPan-1 cells with gemcitabine as it is
the standard chemotherapeutic agent used to treat metastatic
pancreatic cancer (50). Like docetaxel, resistance to gemcitabine is the major reason for its limited therapeutic efﬁcacy
(50). We observed a similar decrease in autophagic ﬂux and
increase in cell death in both Du145 treated with docetaxel as
well as CaPan1 cells treated with gemcitabine (Fig. 5; Supplementary Figs. S4, S9–12), which suggests that upregulation of
the VEGF-C axis is a general adaptation that promotes tumor
cell survival under adverse conditions. Overall, these data
strongly suggest the importance of this axis in autophagic
activation.
Although the increased levels of WDFY-1 and LAMP-2 (to a
lesser extent) following VEGF-C and NRP-2 depletion can
function in the induction of cell death (Fig. 6; Supplementary
Fig. S13), they are not likely to be involved in regulating
autophagy. In future studies, we will unravel their roles in
promoting cell death following autophagy inhibition. Our
ﬁnding that the VEGF-C axis inhibits mTORC1 to activate
autophagy (Fig. 7) is novel and provides a mechanism through
which this axis promotes resistance against treatment.
In conclusion, we have established that the VEGF-C/NRP-2
axis is important in the activation of autophagy following
treatment with chemotherapy. Our data suggest that VEGFC-induced autophagy protects cancer cells from the cytotoxic

stress-induced death as well as the potential of the VEGF-C axis
as a therapeutic target. Our future studies will focus on
determining the mechanism(s) through which WDFY-1 activates cell death downstream of autophagy inhibition. Unraveling these signaling pathways may assist in the development of
novel treatments to overcome chemotherapy resistance.
