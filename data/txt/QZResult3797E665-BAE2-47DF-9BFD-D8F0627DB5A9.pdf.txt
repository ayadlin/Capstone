BACKGROUND: Dapsone, used for Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP) prophylaxis, is associated with increased risk of methemoglobinemia. Absence of cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity causes congenital methemoglobinemia, but
its role in dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia is unknown. The authors sought to elucidate drug-related risk factors for dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia in pediatric oncology patients, including contribution of cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity. METHODS: Among 167 pediatric patients treated for hematologic
malignancies or aplastic anemia who received dapsone for PCP prophylaxis, demographic and dapsone treatment
data were retrospectively collected. Drug-related risk factors were evaluated by Cox proportional hazards, and in a
cross-sectional subgroup of 40 patients, cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity was assessed. RESULTS: Methemoglobinemia (median methemoglobin level ¼ 9.0% [3.5-22.4]) was documented in 32 (19.8%) patients. There was a
73% risk reduction in methemoglobinemia with dosing 20% below the target dose of 2 mg/kg/d (hazard ratio [HR],
0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.78; P ¼ .016), whereas methemoglobinemia risk was increased with dosing
20% above the target dose (HR, 6.25; 95% CI, 2.45-15.93; P < .001). Sex, body mass index, and age were not associated with increased risk. Cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity did not differ by methemoglobinemia status (median 8.6 IU/g hemoglobin [Hb]; [5.5-12.1] vs 9.1 IU/g Hb; [6.7-12.7]). No patient developed PCP on dapsone.
CONCLUSIONS: Methemoglobinemia occurred in almost 20% of pediatric oncology patients receiving dapsone for
PCP prophylaxis. Higher dapsone dosing is associated with increased risk. A cross-sectionally acquired cytochrome
b5 reductase enzyme activity level was not associated with methemoglobinemia risk. Studies are needed to define
biologic correlates of methemoglobinemia and evaluate lower dapsone doses for PCP prophylaxis. Cancer 2011;117:

Dapsone is a synthetic sulfone antimicrobial used as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP) in both cancer and

human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients.1 It is considered the best alternative treatment for PCP prophylaxis in
those who cannot tolerate trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.2 However, its use is limited by adverse effects, such as methemoglobinemia, which occurs when hemoglobin iron becomes trapped in the ferric (Fe3þ) state. Decreased oxygen-carrying capacity leads to severe hypoxia and cyanosis if not treated.3 The prevalence and associated risk factors for dapsoneassociated methemoglobinemia in pediatric patients has not been well studied.1,4-7 Cytochrome b5 reductase is an enzyme
that reduces the toxic metabolite of dapsone (dapsone hydroxylamine) in the liver.8 Complete absence of cytochrome b5
reductase enzyme activity is associated with congenital methemoglobinemia, and its role in dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia has been postulated in a small case series.4 By using a large retrospective cohort, our study was designed to
assess the prevalence of dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia as well as drug and host-related risk factors associated
with increased risk of methemoglobinemia such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and dapsone dosing. In a cross-sectional subset, we sought to evaluate whether a random cytochrome b5 reductase level is associated with the development
of methemoglobinemia. A secondary aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of dapsone in PCP prophylaxis in the
cohort.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Participant Accrual
After human subjects committee approval from the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board, we
assembled a retrospective cohort from all pediatric
patients aged 22 years at the time of diagnosis with a hematologic malignancy or aplastic anemia between 1994
and 2009 and treated by the Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Vanderbilt University who received
dapsone for PCP prophylaxis.
Eligible participants for the retrospective component were identified using a search of the electronic medical record, resulting in a cohort of 167 patients. In
addition, we included a cross-sectional subset in which we
measured cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity in a
group of 20 patients with confirmed methemoglobinemia
and 20 patients who never developed methemoglobinemia to examine the association of a random cytochrome
b5 reductase enzyme activity level with methemoglobinemia development. After institutional review board approval, 40 patients were consecutively identified meeting
inclusion criteria who had upcoming clinic visits and who
had not received dapsone for a minimum of 1 month
before assessment of cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity. Prospective patients eligible for the cross-sectional
subcohort for the evaluation of cytochrome b5 reductase
enzyme activity were sent a letter and then approached in
clinic. Of the 43 patients who were approached, 41 consented. One patient was initially enrolled as a control but
was then found to have had recent suspected methemoglobinemia, and was excluded. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) status was also obtained in all patients
in the cross-sectional component by qualitative fluorescent spot test.

Definitions and Measurements
Confirmed symptomatic methemoglobinemia was
defined as otherwise unexplained cyanosis or hypoxia (02
saturation 95%) together with an elevated methemoglobin level 3% based on co-oximetry measurement of venous blood. Suspected symptomatic methemoglobinemia
included the above symptoms without laboratory-confirmed methemoglobin level. The target dose for dapsone
followed the standard pediatric recommendation of 2 mg/
kg/d with a maximum of 100 mg/d.1 Cytochrome b5 reductase levels were measured at the Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, Minnesota with a commercially
available assay that uses a kinetic spectrometric method,

3486

measuring the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) at 340 nm at 30 C as cytochrome b5 reductase catalyzes the NADH-linked reduction of
ferricyanide, as previous used by Williams et al.4 The reference range for cytochrome b5 reductase is 8.2 to 19.2
IU/g hemoglobin (Hb). Adult values of this enzyme are
obtained by 2 months to 3 months of age (www.may
omedicallaboratories.com).
Data Collection
From the medical record, demographics were collected
for each participant, as well as baseline height and weight.
In addition, cancer diagnosis, dapsone dose, duration of
treatment, adverse side effects, including methemoglobinemia occurrence and presentation, measured methemoglobin level, and treatment were collected. BMI values
were converted to age- and sex-adjusted z scores using the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Year 2000
growth charts for patients aged 2 to 20 years (Epi Info
3.5). Length for weight z scores were substituted for
patients who had measured values before turning 24
months old. In patients older than 20 years, z score data
for age 20 years was used. A patient’s dapsone dose was
considered to be in control at a target range if it fell within
20% of that recommended (2 mg/kg/d, maximum of 100
mg/d).
Statistical Considerations
For the retrospective portion of the study, the primary
endpoint was time to the development of symptomatic
methemoglobinemia. Baseline characteristics were summarized by median with 25th and 75th percentiles for
continuous variables. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages were shown. Mann-Whitney U test
was used for continuous variables, and chi-square or
Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical variables between patients with or without methemoglobinemia. Effects of potential risk factors including age, sex,
BMI z score, and dapsone dose were assessed using a Cox
proportional hazards regression model. To assess effects
of covariates that changed status over the course of follow-up, change in age, BMI z score, and dapsone dosage
variables were treated as time-varying covariates. The
dapsone dose was adjusted any time a patient changed
category (eg, dosed 20% below control vs dosed at target
vs 20% above control). Age and BMI z score were
updated for every 180-day period during follow-up.
Only laboratory-confirmed methemoglobinemia cases
were included in the final analysis. The reliability of the

final regression model was internally validated via bootstrap method9,10 by measuring degree of overfitting
quantified by optimism parameter in a calibration plot.
One hundred fifty resamples were performed with bootstrap with replacement.
For the cross-sectional component of the study, the
primary outcome was cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme
activity level for patients with and without methemoglobinemia. Sample size was determined based on a conservative estimate of difference in mean cytochrome b5
reductase enzyme activity of 3.0 with a pooled standard
deviation of 2.82. Twenty patients were required in each
group to achieve 90% power. However, because the data
by Williams demonstrated that mean difference in cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity was 3.9 based on a
small sample size (10 patients), we estimated the difference conservatively.4 Sample size computation was performed using PS software.11
For patients in the cross-sectional component, a linear regression was conducted to assess whether age and
BMI z score, at the time the cytochrome b5 reductase
enzyme activity levels were obtained, were associated with
measured cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity.
Residuals were evaluated for normality. In patients with
methemoglobinemia, Spearman correlations were performed to assess correlation of cytochrome b5 reductase
enzyme activity with measured methemoglobin level or
the duration of dapsone therapy before developing methemoglobinemia. All statistical inferences were assessed at a
2-sided 5% significant level.

documented hypoxia with O2 saturation levels <95%.
Of those with hypoxia, 44% had O2 saturation levels
<90%. Presentation with suspected methemoglobinemia
most commonly occurred in the outpatient clinic
(59.4%) but was also detected in the inpatient care unit
(34.4%) and far less commonly in the emergency department (6.2%).
Table 1 describes characteristics of patients treated
with dapsone for PCP prophylaxis. Patients with and
without methemoglobinemia were similar with regard to
age, sex, cancer diagnosis, treatment with hematopoietic
cell transplant (HCT), and having a diagnosis of Down
syndrome. There was a slight, but not statistically significant, increase in the number of Hispanic patients in the
methemoglobinemia group, 4 (12.5%) of 32 versus 7
(5.3%) of 131 of controls. Patients without a history of
methemoglobinemia had slightly higher median baseline
BMI z scores (0.79 vs 0.58), although this difference was
not statistically significant, and were on dapsone for longer periods of time than those who developed methemoglobinemia (median 427 days vs 67 days) (P < .001).
Dosing of dapsone differed by methemoglobinemia
status. A greater proportion of patients initially treated
with dapsone 20% below the target dose of 2 mg/kg/d
(46.6% vs 12.5%; P ¼ .001) did not develop methemoglobinemia. Similarly, a higher proportion of patients initially treated with dapsone 20% in excess of the target
dose 2 mg/kg/d (12.5% vs 3.1%; P ¼ .043) developed
methemoglobinemia. This relationship between dose and
methemoglobinemia occurrence remained constant over
time.

RESULTS

Management of Methemoglobinemia
In all cases of methemoglobinemia, dapsone was discontinued when methemoglobinemia was recognized, and
only 1 patient with confirmed methemoglobinemia
required treatment with methylene blue. Chest radiographs were performed in 11 patients, and no significant
abnormalities were noted. Six of the patient were put on
supplemental oxygen until the etiology for hypoxia was
confirmed. No patients had prolonged hypoxia or cyanosis after discontinuation of the dapsone. In addition to
methemoglobinemia, several patients in the cohort had
discontinuation of dapsone for other reasons, including
rash (1.8%), neutropenia (4.8%), hepatic toxicity (3.0%),
and oral intolerance (1.2%), and 1 person each who had
nausea (0.6%), hemolytic anemia (0.6%), thrombocytopenia (0.6%), and unsubstantiated concern for methemoglobinemia (0.6%).

Methemoglobinemia and Dapsone
Administration
All of the patients in our cohort were initially placed on
dapsone prophylaxis because of adverse effects from trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, of which prolonged neutropenia and rash/allergy were most common. Once
treated with dapsone, concern for methemoglobinemia
was triggered by cyanosis or hypoxia.
Confirmed methemoglobinemia was present in 32
(19.8%) of 167 individuals, and an additional 4 patients
had suspected disease. The median measured methemoglobin level was 8.95% (25th, 75th percentiles, 5.48%,
13.08%; range, 3.5%-22.4%). None of these patients had
previously developed methemoglobinemia while on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Of these 32 patients, 34%
of the patients had presented with cyanosis, and 78% had

Among those who required dapsone discontinuation for methemoglobinemia, they were treated with other
alternative therapies for PCP prophylaxis, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (12.5%), inhaled pentamidine (46.9%), atovaquone (37.5%), and intravenous
pentamidine (0.6%) for 1 patient.
Occurrence of PCP
No patients in our cohort developed breakthrough PCP
while on dapsone prophylaxis, with 213.4 patient years of
follow-up. Two patients had previously developed PCP
pneumonia while on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
Among patients removed from dapsone prophylaxis for
methemoglobinemia, 2 patients subsequently developed

3488

PCP pneumonia while on treatment with inhaled
pentamidine.
Multivariate Analysis
In the multivariate Cox model, dapsone dose was associated with risk of methemoglobinemia (Table 2). Compared with the target dose of 2 mg/kg/d, doses 20%
lower than the target dose resulted in a protective effect,
with 73% reduction in the hazard of methemoglobinemia
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.09-0.78; P ¼ .016). Conversely, doses 20% over the
target dose significantly increased risk for methemoglobinemia (HR, 6.25; 95% CI, 2.45–15.93; P < .001). Age,
sex, and BMI z score were not significant risk factors for

methemoglobinemia. The optimism for the final model
was estimated as 0.146, meaning the degree of overfitting
was 14.6%, providing no evidence of overfitting.
Cross-sectional Component
The potential association of cytochrome b5 reductase
enzyme activity and dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia was assessed in a subcohort of 20 patients with confirmed methemoglobinemia and 20 patients without
methemoglobinemia. These patient groups did not differ
with regard to age, sex, diagnosis, treatment with HCT,
and initial BMI z score (Table 3). As was true for the

periods of time than did those with methemoglobinemia
(median, 798 vs 70 days). The association between dapsone dose and prevalence of methemoglobinemia that was
observed in the entire cohort was also evident in the
subcohort.
The 20 patients in the methemoglobinemia group
had a median measured methemoglobin level of 9.85%
(25th, 75th quartile, 5.13, 11.68). The G6PD screen
revealed 1 patient in the methemoglobinemia group and
none in the control group to be G6PD deficient. The
patient with G6PD deficiency had the highest measured
methemoglobin level in the cohort at 22.4. Cytochrome
b5 reductase levels were similar between groups, with the
median level of 8.6 IU/g Hb (range, 5.5-12.1) in patients
with methemoglobinemia versus 9.1 IU/g Hb (range, 6.712.7) in patients without methemoglobinemia. Six
patients in the methemoglobinemia group (5.5; 6.1; 6.1;
7.1; 7.2; 8.1) and 5 patients in the control group (6.7;
7.1; 7.5; 7.6; 8.1) had cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme
activity levels below the reference range. No patients were
receiving dapsone at the time the levels were drawn. Cytochrome b5 reductase levels did not correlate with measured methemoglobin levels (Spearman q ¼ 0.51, P ¼

.83) or time treated with dapsone before methemoglobinemia (Spearman q ¼ 0.191, P ¼ .23). When included in
the Cox proportional hazards model, cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity was not found to be a risk factor
for methemoglobinemia, and a linear regression model
confirmed that age and BMI z score were not associated
with the cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity level.

DISCUSSION
Dapsone is an effective second-line agent for PCP prophylaxis for those who cannot tolerate trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.1 This study is confirmatory of this efficacy, as
there was no PCP breakthrough in >234 patient-years of
follow-up. However, despite widespread use, few studies
have examined the prevalence of and risk factors for dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia, and to our knowledge this represents the largest cohort of pediatric
oncology patients in which this has been examined. Most
other reports of dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia
have not analyzed potential risk factors.5,12-15
Our prevalence of confirmed methemoglobinemia
cases approaches 20%, which is higher than what has been
reported in the adult literature,3 but consistent with a rate
of 20% previously observed in a much smaller cohort (N
¼ 15) of pediatric oncology patients.4
Age, sex, and BMI z score were not risk factors for
dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia in our cohort,
consistent with that of Ash-Bernal et al.3
In our cohort, we identified dapsone dosing to be a
strong risk factor for methemoglobinemia, with a doseresponse relation evident, a finding that, to our knowledge, has not been reported previously in children,
although it was suggested in some early adult pharmacokinetic studies.16 In addition, there were no cases of PCP in
our cohort who received dapsone, even among those who
received lower doses. These data raise the question of
whether dapsone could be effectively used in PCP prophylaxis in pediatrics at a lower dose, where methemoglobinemia risk was much lower. Pharmacokinetic data from
HIV patients suggest that this is indeed possible, with efficacy and adequate lung penetration evident when dapsone
was given once per week.17,18 Several subsequent studies
in pediatric HIV have suggested that 2 to 3 times weekly
dosing of 2 mg/kg results in acceptable drug levels and
lung penetration.19-21 One study comparing dapsone dosing (1 mg/kg/d vs 4 mg/kg/wk vs 2 mg/kg/d) in 94 pediatric HIV-positive children demonstrated no statistically
significant difference in PCP breakthrough.22 There have

3490

been no studies evaluating alternative schedules of dapsone dosing in pediatric oncology patients, where PCP
occurs less commonly than in HIV patients.
The pathogenesis of dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia is not well understood. Cytochrome b5 reductase is an enzyme that is important in restoring
methemoglobin back to its ferrous state.23 When the
enzyme is congenitally absent, it causes cyanosis from
birth. There is a type-1 variant of this disorder in which
the cytochrome b5 reductase is only decreased in the red
blood cells and leads to occasional cyanosis.23 It has therefore been hypothesized that low levels of this enzyme may
predispose individuals to dapsone-associated methemoglobinemia. Williams and colleagues found a statistically
nonsignificant difference in cytochrome b5 reductase levels between 3 patients with methemoglobinemia (cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity ¼ 8.6 IU/g Hb)
compared with 7 patients without methemoglobinemia
(cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity ¼ 12.5 IU/g
Hb).4 Our study, which was designed with appropriate
statistical power to detect such a difference, failed to confirm this finding. Our study demonstrated slightly
decreased cytochrome b5 reductase levels in patients with
and without methemoglobinemia, and only 1 patient had
a level that was 40% below the reference range, indicating
a true heterozygous state. Thus, we cannot conclusively
state whether a more robust deficiency in cytochrome b5
reductase enzyme activity is a risk factor for methemoglobinemia. However, as only 1 patient of 20 with methemoglobinemia in our cohort had a 40% reduction in
cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity, and mildly
decreased levels were seen among patients without methemoglobinemia, cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity
level is unlikely to be a useful screening test to predict
most patients at risk for dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia. Because of the known association of methemoglobinemia resulting from hemolysis in individuals with
G6PD deficiency,3,24 patients should be screened for this
before the onset of dapsone therapy, as is evidenced by
our patient with G6PD deficiency who had the highest
methemoglobin level in the cohort.
There are multiple medications that are associated
with methemoglobinemia, mostly notably benzocaine,
chloroquine, eutectic mixture of local anesthetics cream,
lidocaine, metoclopromide, nitrates, and phenazopyridine.3 In our cohort, 38 patients received metoclopromide;
of these, 1 patient had confirmed methemoglobinemia,
and another patient had suspected methemoglobinemia.
An additional patient with methemoglobinemia received

both dapsone and metoclopromide concurrently, but not
at the time of methemoglobinemia diagnosis. Notably, no
patient with methemoglobinemia was on drugs that conferred increased risk when methemoglobinemia was diagnosed, and there were no differences in the exposure to
methemoglobin-inducing medications in those with and
without methemoglobinemia. Sepsis and gastrointestinal
infection have also been associated with methemoglobinemia3; however, these conditions were not present in any of
our cohort at the time of the methemoglobinemia event.
Another risk factor for methemoglobinemia is
G6PD deficiency.3 Patients with G6PD deficiency are at
increased risk of oxidative stress because of depletion of
reduced glutathione. Exogenous oxidizing agents can then
overwhelm the cytochrome b5 reductase system, leading
to increased production of methemoglobin.24 No patient
in our cohort had a known family history of G6PD, and
only 1 patient in the cross-sectional component of the
study was found to be deficient.
Better defining those at risk for methemoglobinemia
has clear implications for the choice of second-line alternatives to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP prophylaxis. If a dose could be identified that is associated
with a much lower risk of methemoglobinemia, dapsone
could have more widespread use, and it is more cost-effective than other alternatives, which include aerosolized or
intravenous pentamidine and atovaquone. Monthly aerosolized pentamidine has been shown to be effective in preventing PCP with minimal side effects,1 but PCP
breakthrough is higher than with dapsone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.25 In our cohort, 2 patients developed PCP after being switched to aerosolized
pentamidine because of inability to be treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or dapsone. In addition to the
concern for efficacy, aerosolized pentamidine is an expensive agent (approximate 1 year therapy ¼ $1200, with
additional financial, technical, and personnel resources
required). Younger pediatric patients also may not be able
to adequately inhale an effective dose.1,26 Intravenous
pentamidine is also used, but efficacy remains a concern,
as radioisotope-imaging data have shown that intravenous
pentamidine has poor lung penetration compared with
the inhaled formulation.27-29 A previous smaller study
from our institution showed PCP breakthrough in 2
(16.7%) of 12 pediatric oncology patients,30 and Kim et
al recently demonstrated 1.3% PCP breakthrough rate in
a study of 232 pediatric oncology patients.26 A 5.5%
breakthrough rate was identified in a study of 30 pediatric
HIV patients.27

Atovaquone is another alternative to dapsone and
has been shown to be effective in pediatric cancer patients,
with an acceptable toxicity profile.31 However, it is much
more expensive than dapsone, with atovaquone having a
US retail daily cost of $52/d for an adolescent or adult
($18,980/y) and $26/d for a 25 kg child ($9490/y).1,31
This is in contrast to a daily cost of $1.30 to an adult taking daily dapsone ($474.50/y) and $0.65/d for a 25 kg
child ($237.25/y). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole still
remains the most cost-effective, at a cost of only $0.29 per
double-strength tablet ($60.32/y at twice daily twice a
week), and thus remains first-line treatment.
Our study has some limitations. It is a retrospective
study, and thus adherence with prescribed dosing could
not be assessed, nor could the full clinical presentation of
methemoglobinemia be verified in all cases. We were also
unable to obtain cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme activity
serum levels at the time of the methemoglobinemia event
and thus cannot fully disregard its role in the pathogenesis
of methemoglobinemia. As there is no reason to believe
that the enzyme levels we obtained were associated with
age or BMI, it still appears that a random 1-time level will
not be an adequate screening test. Patients enrolled in the
cross-sectional component of the study were consecutively
as opposed to randomly selected, but these patients did
not differ in any discernable factors from those not enrolled, with the exception that those who were lost to
follow-up or deceased could not be included in the
subcohort.
Conclusions
In conclusion, dapsone is an effective drug for PCP prophylaxis that remains the most inexpensive second-line alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and is well tolerated
by the majority of patients. However, its use is limited by the
common occurrence of methemoglobinemia as an adverse
event, which can be life-threatening and results in increased
medical costs and distress to families. Given the dose-related
association and lack of PCP breakthrough at the lower doses,
a prospective trial of lower doses or dosing at less frequent
intervals is warranted to improve the utility of dapsone, better define the dose-related occurrence of methemoglobinemia, and identify biologic correlates that may help predict
those at highest risk for methemoglobinemia.
