Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSC) are thought to be responsible for tumor initiation and tumor regeneration after
chemotherapy. Previously, we showed that chemotherapy of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells lines
can select for outgrowth of highly tumorigenic and metastatic CSCs. The high malignancy of lung CSCs
was associated with an efficient cytokine network. In this study, we provide evidence that blocking stem
cell factor (SCF)–c-kit signaling is sufficient to inhibit CSC proliferation and survival promoted by chemotherapy. CSCs were isolated from NSCLC cell lines as tumor spheres under CSC-selective conditions
and their stem properties were confirmed. In contrast to other tumor cells, CSCs expressed c-kit receptors and produced SCF. Proliferation of CSCs was inhibited by SCF-neutralizing antibodies or by imatinib (Gleevec), an inhibitor of c-kit. Although cisplatin treatment eliminated the majority of tumor cells, it
did not eliminate CSCs, whereas imatinib or anti-SCF antibody destroyed CSCs. Significantly, combining cisplatin with imatinib or anti-SCF antibody prevented the growth of both tumor cell subpopulations. Our findings reveal an important role for the SCF–c-kit signaling axis in self-renewal and proliferation of lung CSCs,
and they suggest that SCF–c-kit signaling blockade could improve the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy of
human NSCLC. Cancer Res; 70(1); 338–46. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a rare subpopulation of undifferentiated cells that are responsible for tumor initiation, maintenance, and spreading (1–3). They are drug
resistant and display the ability to self-renew and generate
a progeny of the differentiated cells that constitute a large
majority of the cells in tumors. CSCs have been identified
in various human malignancies, including breast, brain,
prostate, pancreatic, colon, and lung cancer (1, 4–10).
CSCs can be grown in vitro as tumor spheres under nonadherent conditions using a serum-free medium that is
supplemented with growth factors (11, 12). A universal
marker for CSCs has not been identified, but, in many tumors, CSCs exhibit CD133 (5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14). We have
found that human lung CSCs also express c-kit receptors,

embryonic markers (SSEA-3, TRA-1-81, Oct-4, and nuclear
β-catenin), and low levels of the cytokeratins 8/18 (CK8/
18; ref. 10).
We have previously shown that treating tumor cells with
chemotherapeutic drugs selectively enriches the survival of
CSCs. Furthermore, the drugs prevent the differentiation
of CSCs, thus maintaining the proliferation of the drugresistant CSCs. We proposed that the highly tumorigenic
and metastatic properties of CSCs are based on their advanced cytokine network. Our findings revealed an upregulated level of major human angiogenic and growth factors
[vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, hepatocyte
growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and stem cell
growth factor-β (SCGF-β)] and VEGF receptor 2, FGF receptor 2, and CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4 receptors in lung
CSC–derived tumors (10). We also showed that drug treatment stimulates the production of various cytokines, chemokines, and angiogenic and growth factors. Blocking one
or more of these factors with neutralizing antibodies could
potentially increase tumor cell sensitivity to chemotherapy
drugs (15).
We hypothesize that the proliferation of CSCs can also be
stimulated by these growth factors. We have previously
shown that lung CSCs express c-kit receptors and produce
elevated levels of stem cell factor (SCF; ref. 10). This suggests
a possible role the SCF–c-kit axis plays in the self-renewal
and proliferation of CSCs in solid tumors.

Elimination of CSCs by Blocking SCF–c-kit Signaling

Human c-kit, which has been shown to function as a
SCF receptor, is a transmembrane receptor with a protein
tyrosine kinase, an extracellular ligand binding domain, a
single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic kinase
domain. C-kit stimulation by SCF results in dimerization,
autophosphorylation, and a subsequent activation of downstream effector proteins, including the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt; phospholipase C, gamma 1 (PLCG1);
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT); and
RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (16–18). SCF
is a major cytokine for the self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of numerous embryonic, adult hematopoietic,
neural, and primordial stem cells (19, 20).
Accumulating data indicate that SCF is a mitogenic and
angiogenic factor involved in carcinogenesis. Binding SCF to
c-kit results in the activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase
activity and promotes tumor growth (21–23). SCF and c-kit
are overexpressed in some human malignancies, including
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), breast cancer,
SCLC, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and glioma
(16, 18, 24). Cancer patients with either overexpression or
mutations of c-kit in their tumors have poor prognosis
and lower survival rates and show resistance to chemotherapy (25).
We hypothesize that blocking the SCF–c-kit signaling loop
would lead to an interference with the proliferation or survival of c-kit–positive CSCs. It is considered that the survival of
drug-resistant CSCs is a major obstacle for successful chemotherapy (2). Thus, inhibition or even elimination of CSCs by
disruption of the SCF–c-kit loop might inhibit the regeneration of tumor cells from CSCs and thereby increase the efficacy of chemotherapy.
To test this hypothesis, we isolated CSCs from human
non–smal cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and analyzed
the effect recombinant SCF and an antibody-neutralizing
SCF had on the proliferation of CSCs. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (also known as STI571 or Gleevec) is a small
molecule belonging to the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine classes,
which selectively inhibits c-kit, BCR/ABL, and PDGF receptor
(PDGFR) signaling (26). Imatinib is approved by the Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of AML and GIST
(27, 28). Imatinib as monotherapy was used in clinical trials
against different solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, and
small cell lung cancer; however, no clinical responses were
detected (29–31).
We investigated whether imatinib or anti-SCF antibody
affects the survival of lung CSCs and potentiates the efficacy of cisplatin against NSCLC cells. We found that SCF stimulates the efficacy of cisplatin, whereas anti-SCF antibody
inhibited the proliferation of lung CSCs. Imatinib did not
affect bulk cell proliferation. Thus, the disruption of the
SCF–c-kit autocrine loop can be a useful approach against
CSCs. A combination of imatinib or anti-SCF antibody with
cisplatin treatment resulted in a destruction of tumor cells
and blocked the selection of CSCs. Our data indicate that
imatinib might be helpful when used in combination with
chemotherapy for a more efficacious treatment for NSCLC
patients.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. NSCLC cell lines H460 and A549 were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells
were grown in culture medium, as recommended by the
ATCC.
Reagents. Cisplatin, doxorubicin, Hoechst 33342, insulin,
bFGF, antibody-neutralizing PDGFRα-β, and PDGFAA-BB
were from Sigma-Aldrich. Methylcellulose (MC)–based medium was from Stem Cell Technologies. Imatinib was from
LC Laboratories (PKC Pharmaceutical, Inc.). Fluorochromeconjugated antibodies against human c-kit were from
Beckman Coulter. Recombinant human SCF and antibodies
against PDGFRα and PDGFRβ were from R&D Systems,
Inc. Antibodies against SCF, c-kit, CD133, and CK8/18 were
from Abcam, Inc. Epidermal growth factor (EGF); Alexa
Fluor 488–conjugated anti–TRA-1-60, anti–TRA-1-81, and
anti–SSEA-1-4; and the antibody against human β-catenin
were purchased from BD Biosciences, Inc. Secondary Alexa
Fluor 488–conjugated and Alexa Fluor 680–conjugated
antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen).
Culture of lung cancer spheres. Suspension growth was
assessed as described (11, 12). Briefly, cells were suspended
in 0.8% MC-based serum-free medium supplemented with
EGF, bFGF, 20 ng/mL, and 4 μg/mL insulin and plated at
500 to 10,000 per milliliter in ultralow-attachment 24- and
96-well plates (Corning). The medium was replaced or supplemented with fresh growth factors twice a week. To assess
the self-renewing potential of the cells, first-generation
spheres were collected by gentle centrifugation, dissociated
into single-cell suspensions, and cultured under the conditions described above. The same procedures were repeated
with the second- and third-generation spheres.
Differentiation. Cells that were dissociated from spheres
were grown in adherent conditions in a culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as described
(10). To test the self-renewing potential of differentiated cells,
the cells were transferred to stem cell–selective conditions
and their ability to form tumor spheres was evaluated as described above. To perform a phenotypic characterization of
cells from spheres and cells after differentiation, cells were
seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 103 per well) and stained with
the various antibodies described above.
Effects of human recombinant SCF and neutralizing SCF
antibody on the proliferation of lung cells. CSCs were dissociated into a single-cell suspension, plated (1,000 cells/mL)
in ultralow-attachment plates, and cultured in stem cell–
selective conditions. Human recombinant SCF (0–100 ng/mL)
or neutralizing SCF antibody (0.1–1.0 μg/mL) was added
for 3–12 days. Tumor spheres were counted and measured
under the microscope.
NSCLC cells were plated onto 96-well plates precoated
with collagen and cultured in the presence/absence of SCF
or neutralizing SCF antibody for 72 h. Cells were counted
using the Cellomics ArrayScan as described (10, 32).
Drug resistance studies. CSCs were dissociated into a
single-cell suspension and plated (1,000 cells/mL) in ultralow-attachment plates in stem cell–selective medium.

grown in collagen-precoated 96-well plates and incubated with
anti-CD133 and secondary Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies or primary antibodies against c-kit, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, β-catenin,
PDGFRα, or PDGFRβ conjugated with FITC, phycoerythrin, or
Alexa Fluor 488. To detect intracellular proteins, cells were incubated with primary antibodies against SCF, β-catenin, Oct-4,
or CK8/18 and with secondary antibodies conjugated with
Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 680. To stain tumor spheres,
all manipulations were done under microscopic control.
Analysis of SCF in tumor cell conditioned medium. Cells
were cultivated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS
for 48 h. Samples of conditioned medium were collected
and the cells were counted. Concentrations of human SCF

were analyzed using xMAP technology (Luminex Corp.). Concentrations of SCF (pg/106 cells/mL) were calculated.
Statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated at
least thrice. Comparisons between values were performed using a two-tailed Student's t test. For the comparison of multiple groups, a one- or two-way ANOVA test was applied. For
all statistical analyses, the level of significance was set at a
probability of <0.05 (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).

of tumor sphere–forming cells in comparison with A549
(Fig. 1A). Cells that were derived from first-generation
spheres in both lines showed a high and equal ability to form
second-generation spheres. Third-generation spheres were
used in our experiments. We tested the CSC nature of cells
in tumor spheres as described (10). The Cellomics ArrayScan
HCS Reader was used for the imaging and analysis of CSC
expression and embryonic stem cell markers in lung tumor
cells. Tumor spheres were enriched in CSCs and early progenitor cells; they consistently expressed lung CSC marker
CD133 (Fig. 1B) and embryonic cell markers TRA-1-81, nuclear β-catenin, and Oct-4 (data not shown); and had a low expression of epithelial markers CK8/18 (Fig. 1C). CD133 +
fractions varied from 1.4% in A549 cells to 1.7% in H460
bulk cells, whereas 31.7% cells in A549-derived tumor
spheres and 70.9% cells in H460-derived tumor spheres were
CD133+ (Fig. 1B). Cells in tumor spheres were self-renewing:
cells dissociated from first-generation spheres formed the
second-generation spheres. If tumor spheres were plated into
adherent plastic plates with a culture medium supplemented
with FBS and cultivated for 4 weeks, they generated a differentiated progeny with the phenotypic features of lung cancer
cells and gradually acquired cytokeratins, whereas the CSC
markers were lost during differentiation (Fig. 1D). Thus, our
results showed that cells isolated from H460 and A549 cells
and growing as tumor spheres have all features of CSCs: they
express CSC markers (CD133 and c-kit) and embryonic stem
cell markers (Oct-4, TRA-1-81, and nuclear β-catenin), have a
low level of differentiated markers (CK8/18), and are able to
self-renew and to differentiate losing CSC markers and gaining CK8/18. These results in combination with our previous
in vivo data showed that CSCs isolated from H460 cells have

342

Cancer Res; 70(1) January 1, 2010

high tumorigenic and metastatic abilities (10) and indicate
that cells in lung tumor spheres have the characteristics of
CSCs. In the absence of in vivo determination of tumorigenic
properties of A549 cells isolated from tumor spheres, these
cells cannot be unequivocally defined as lung CSCs. However,
the findings that H460 and A549 cells growing in tumor
spheres manifest identical phenotypic properties of CSCs as
well as the ability of self-renewal and differentiation give us
the ground to conclude that these cells derived from two
NSCLC cell lines are CSCs. Henceforth, CSCs from H460 and
A549 cell lines will be termed CSC/H and CSC/A, respectively.
CSCs in tumor spheres expressed c-kit (Fig. 2A). When
CSCs were cultivated in collagen-precoated plates for 8 hours,
>60% of lung CSCs expressed c-kit (Fig. 2B). If these cells
were cultured in medium supplemented with FBS for 4
weeks, they differentiated and changed their morphology
and the percentage of c-kit+ cells substantially decreased
(1.9% and 1.1% for cells differentiated from CSC/A and
CSC/H cells).
Next, the expression of SCF in bulk cells and CSCs was
tested. Immunofluorescence staining revealed a high intracellular level of SCF in CSCs (Fig. 2C), whereas the SCF level
in the bulk population was undetectable. Similarly, a low level of SCF was detected in culture medium conditioned by
A549 and H460 cells, whereas CSCs produced higher levels
of SCF (Fig. 2D). These findings indicate that SCF–c-kit axis
is associated with the CSC phenotype in the NSCLC cells.
Stimulation of lung CSC growth by exogenous SCF. Recombinant SCF was used to test the importance of SCF–ckit signaling for CSC growth. Dose-response analyses showed
that SCF has a major proliferative effect at a concentration of
10 ng/mL. SCF-stimulated CSC proliferation was manifested

Elimination of CSCs by Blocking SCF–c-kit Signaling

in augmenting the yield of formed spheres and their sizes
(Fig. 3A and B). To test whether SCF can stimulate the proliferation of already developed tumor spheres, SCF was first
added on the 7th day of culturing, resulting in an increased
size of spheres (P < 0.05) and the number of cells in the
spheres by 20% (P < 0.05). These data indicate that SCF
stimulated the proliferation of CSCs but had no significant
effect on bulk A549 and H460 cell proliferation (data not
shown).
Next, the effect of neutralizing SCF antibody (01–1.0 μg/mL)
on tumor sphere formation was analyzed. The neutralization
of SCF resulted in a 4-fold reduction of the total number of
growing CSC/A spheres and almost completely abrogated
the growth of CSC/H tumor spheres (Fig. 3C). The remaining
CSC/A tumor spheres that were growing with the anti-SCF
antibody had a significantly smaller size (P < 0.001) than
spheres growing in control wells (Fig. 3D).
Effect of c-kit inhibitor imatinib on CSCs. Imatinib abrogated CSC/H growth at nanomolar concentrations (10–100
nmol/L) and drastically reduced the size of tumor spheres
from CSC/A cells (Fig. 4A and B). The average diameter of control CSC/A sphere was 1.74 ± 0.34 μm, whereas in the presence
of imatinib the diameter was 0.66 ± 0.21 μm.
Effect of combined imatinib and cisplatin treatment on
growth of bulk tumor cells and CSCs. Earlier, we found that
treating H460 cells with drugs led to the elimination of the
vast majority of the cells; however, CSCs formed visible colonies after 7 to 10 days of drug treatment (10). We hypothesized
that a combined cisplatin-imatinib treatment could be more
efficient than each drug used separately, perhaps leading to a
virtually complete elimination of non-CSCs and CSCs.
CSCs were resistant to conventional chemotherapy, and only a partial reduction in sphere formation was observed. In
contrast, imatinib alone or in combination with cisplatin or
doxorubicin dramatically reduced CSC growth (Fig. 4A and B).
We assessed to see if imatinib could inhibit the proliferation of, or even eliminate, CSCs from the bulk cell population
and thus increase the efficacy of therapy. Imatinib at 10
nmol/L to 2 μmol/L did not affect the growth of NSCLC cells
(Fig. 4A). In contrast, cisplatin substantially reduced cell
numbers, although A549 cells were more resistant than
H460 cells (Fig. 5A). A combined cisplatin-imatinib treatment
for 72 hours had a similar inhibitory effect as the cisplatin
alone (Fig. 5A). This could be explained by the low proportion of CSCs in the bulk populations. After 3 to 6 days of
treatment, a significant (P < 0.001) reduction in cell numbers
was detected in the cultures treated with cisplatin or the
combination of cisplatin-imatinib (Fig. 5B). During the next
week of culturing, substantial differences appeared between
the cells treated with cisplatin alone and the cisplatinimatinib combination. A population of morphologically distinct small cells started to proliferate and form multiple,
fast-growing colonies in the cultures treated with cisplatin
alone. No growing clones of lung CSCs were found after
cisplatin-imatinib treatment (Fig. 5C). A vast majority of
the cells died; however, some of the cells resembled senescent
cells with an enlarged and flattened morphology. These “senescent” cells grew larger in size and died during the next 4 to 10

weeks. No growing tumor spheres were found when these cells
were harvested and plated into ultralow-attachment plastic
plates with CSC-selective medium. No significant changes in
cell number in control cultures and in cultures treated with imatinib alone were detected after 12 days (Fig. 5B). To examine
the proportion of CSCs, we harvested cells from 12-day cultures
and plated them in stem cell–selective conditions. As shown in
Fig. 5D, low numbers of spheres grew from the nontreated
H460 and A549 cells and a 10-fold number of spheres
developed from the cells in post-cisplatin treatment. This
indicates that cisplatin treatment enriched the population
with CSCs. However, no tumor spheres were grown from
the cells that were treated with the combination of cisplatin
and imatinib. Thus, a combination of imatinib and cisplatin
could be highly efficient against the regeneration of tumor
cells by drug-resistant CSCs.
Next, we tested whether a treatment of bulk NSCLC cells
with a combination of cisplatin and neutralizing SCF antibody
would inhibit CSC selection. Treatment of H460 and A549 cells
with cisplatin in the presence of anti-SCF antibody resulted in
a significant reduction in survived cells (Fig. 5B). Thus, the major inhibitory effect of imatinib on the growth of CSCs was mediated via c-kit–SCF signaling. Because imatinib inhibits not
only c-kit but also PDGFR signaling (16), we analyzed whether
PDGF signaling is involved in the inhibitory effects of imatinib.
Both bulk cells and CSCs express PDGFRα and PDGFRβ receptors; however, antibody-neutralizing PDGFAA, PDGFBB,
and their receptors did not inhibit the growth of CSCs in tumor spheres (Supplementary Fig. S1).
It was reported that imatinib could reverse drug resistance
in osteosarcoma cells (33). To exclude a possibility that imatinib increases tumor cell drug uptake rather than inhibiting

or eliminating CSCs, we tested if the combination of cisplatinimatinib was effective if imatinib was applied 1 to 3 days after cisplatin treatment. Bulk cells were treated with cisplatin
for 24 hours and the medium was replaced. Imatinib was
added to cultures after 24 or 72 hours of cisplatin treatment.
Surviving cells were grown in stem cell–selective conditions,
and the generation of tumor spheres was evaluated. It was
found that imatinib treatment completely prevented sphere
formation (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, imatinib was able
to eliminate CSCs even when it was added 1 to 3 days after
cisplatin treatments.

Discussion
In this study, we showed that lung CSCs expressed c-kit
and produced high levels of SCF. Coexpression of c-kit and
SCF was shown only in a fraction of metastatic NSCLC
(34). The functional analysis of SCF–c-kit axis signaling in
CSCs revealed that SCF stimulates the proliferation of
CSCs, whereas neutralizing SCF with an antibody or inhibition of c-kit with imatinib abrogated growth of CSCs.
However, the degree of inhibition with the neutralizing
antibody was higher than the level of CSC growth stimulation with exogenous SCF. This discrepancy can be explained by our findings that CSCs produce SCF that, by
binding to c-kit, could stimulate CSC proliferation. Adding
exogenous SCF only had a limited effect. In contrast, imatinib blocks the ability of endogenous or exogenous SCF to
activate c-kit receptors, thus resulting in a profound inhibi-

tion of CSC growth. These data show the prime importance
of SCF–c-kit signaling for the proliferation and survival of
lung CSCs.
Imatinib is used as monotherapy against GIST and leukemia (27, 35). In patients, imatinib plasma concentrations fall
in the range of 0.17 to 5.68 μmol/L when 25 to 600 mg of the
drug were administered per day (27). Our finding revealed
that imatinib blocked growth of CSCs at concentrations that
were similar to the plasma levels found in patients who were
treated with imatinib. In contrast to CSCs, imatinib had no
detectable effect on bulk NSCLC cells. This failure seems to
be due to lack of the c-kit expression by the vast majority of
these cells. Although c-kit–positive CSCs exist in the bulk cell
lines, they represent a very small proportion and the effect on
their inhibition through imatinib is very difficult to detect
from the cell count.
Imatinib inhibits not only c-kit but also PDGFR signaling
(16). PDGF and its receptors are frequently expressed in solid tumors and are associated with the distant metastasis of
tumors (36). It has been considered that imatinib inhibits
ovarian cancer cell growth through the PDGFR inactivation
(37). However, the concentrations of imatinib that inhibited
PDGFR signaling were much higher than those that inhibit
CSCs and can be achieved in the plasma of GIST patients
(27). Our data showed that the major inhibitory effect of
imatinib on the growth of CSCs was mediated via c-kit–
SCF signaling.
Recent studies have shown that GIST and AML cancers
can develop a resistance to imatinib as a result of mutations

Elimination of CSCs by Blocking SCF–c-kit Signaling

in KIT (38, 39) or overexpression of ABCB1 pump protein
(40). Strategies are developing to overcome therapeutic imatinib resistance, including screening for second-generation
inhibitors (40, 41).
Here, we showed that a cisplatin-imatinib treatment of
NSCLC cells growing in vitro led to potent inhibition or
even elimination of both non-CSCs and CSCs. Our previous
studies have shown that chemotherapeutic drugs substantially upregulate the production of multiple factors (15).
This stimulation of growth factors could be a result of an
adaptive stress response through which tumor cells protect
themselves from toxicity and provide prosurvival stimuli.
This may also stimulate CSC proliferation. Drug treatment
induced a multifactorial signaling, with an activation of various transcription factors, such as NF-κB, AP-1-2, ATF-2,
cyclic AMP–responsive element binding protein, hypoxiainducible factor-1, STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5, all of
which play an important role in the upregulation of genes
that encode various cytokine, chemokine, and growth factors (15, 42, 43). Previously, we showed that lung CSCs
had an advanced cytokine network in comparison with bulk
NSCLC cells (10). The inhibitory effect imatinib has on CSCs
may be associated with the downregulation of prosurvival
signaling. Akt, constitutively activated in NSCLC cells, is
very important for survival of cells exposed to drugs (44,
45). Imatinib treatment downregulates the PI3K-Akt pathway (46, 47).
Clinically, chemotherapy is administered in cycles that
are separated by 3-week intervals. However, during this resting period, tumor cells can aggressively repopulate the tumor (48). It is considered that conventional chemotherapy
could lead to elimination of the bulk tumor cells and increase the proportion of drug-resistant CSCs capable of restoring progressive tumor growth (10). Our data indicate
that the SCF–c-kit axis is a key regulator for lung CSC survival and proliferation; therefore, antitumor therapy of patients with advanced lung cancer might be significantly
improved by combining conventional chemotherapy with

inhibitors such as imatinib that would target the SCF–ckit axis.
To summarize, our in vitro studies show the importance
of SCF–c-kit axis in the survival and proliferation of lung
CSCs. We found that blocking the SCF–c-kit autocrine loop
resulted in the complete elimination of CSCs. Combined
cisplatin-imatinib therapy for lung cancer patients might
lead to an inhibition of both non-CSC and CSC populations
and thereby substantially improve the efficacy of chemotherapy. Further in vivo studies are necessary to confirm
that imatinib in combination with cisplatin could have a
potent therapeutic effect against NSCLC xenografted in severe combined immunodeficient mice.
