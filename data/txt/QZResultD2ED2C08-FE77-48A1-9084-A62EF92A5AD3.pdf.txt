Abstract
STAT3 is well corroborated preclinically as a cancer therapeutic target, but tractable translational strategies for
its blockade by small molecule inhibitors have remained elusive. In this study, we report the development of a
novel class of bifunctional STAT3 inhibitors, based on conjugation of a diarylidenyl-piperidone (DAP) backbone to
an N-hydroxypyrroline (–NOH) group, which exhibits minimal toxicity against normal cells and good oral
bioavailability. Molecular modeling studies of this class suggested direct interaction with the STAT3 DNA binding
domain. In particular, the DAP compound HO-3867 selectively inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, transcription,
and DNA binding without affecting the expression of other active STATs. HO-3867 exhibited minimal toxicity
toward noncancerous cells and tissues but induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Pharmacologic analysis
revealed greater bioabsorption and bioavailability of the active (cytotoxic) metabolites in cancer cells compared
with normal cells. The selective cytotoxicity of HO-3867 seemed to be multifaceted, eliciting differential activation
of the Akt pathway in normal versus cancer cells. RNAi attenuation experiments conﬁrmed the requirement of
STAT3 for HO-3867–mediated apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. In vivo testing showed that HO-3867 could block
xenograft tumor growth without toxic side effects. Furthermore, in primary human ovarian cancer cells isolated
from patient ascites, HO-3867 inhibited cell migration/invasion and survival. Our results offer preclinical proof-ofconcept for HO-3867 as a selective STAT3 inhibitor to treat ovarian cancer and other solid tumors where STAT3
is widely upregulated. Cancer Res; 74(8); 2316–27. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The toxic side effects that standard anticancer drugs exert on
healthy tissues and normal cells present obstacles in cancer
treatment. These effects lead to dose reductions, treatment
delays, and even the discontinuation of therapy. "Targeted
therapy" is a relatively modern term commonly used to describe
new agents, including small molecules and monoclonal antibodies, speciﬁcally designed to take advantage molecular pathways involved in the pathophysiology to be treated. A secondary

goal of such developments is to limit the negative side effects
these molecules exert on normal tissues. Unfortunately, even
new therapeutics cause signiﬁcant adverse effects on normal
tissues, leading to toxicity. Thus, development of safe and targeted anticancer therapies that selectively kill cancer cells while
sparing the surrounding healthy tissues is essential.
We identiﬁed a novel class of bifunctional compounds based
on a diarylidenyl-piperidone (DAP) backbone conjugated to an
N-hydroxypyrroline (–NOH; a nitroxide precursor) group for
their inhibitory property on STAT3 activation (1, 2). Previous
work found that DAP compounds exhibit more toxicity toward
cancer cells when compared with noncancerous cells. However, the mechanism behind this selectivity was not fully
elucidated. We hypothesize that the addition of the –NOH
moiety functions as a modulator of cytotoxicity, imparting
antioxidant protection to noncancerous tissues, while allowing
the compound to maintain toxicity toward cancer cells. Two
compounds, HO-3867 (possessing the –NOH moiety) and
H-4073 (lacking the –NOH moiety) with the same DAP backbone were used to expound upon this concept (1, 3–5). In this
study, we conﬁrm the selective toxicity of HO-3867 as compared with H-4073. The mechanism of this selectivity is a
differential interaction of HO-3867 and H-4073 with STAT3
in normal and cancer cells, with no impact upon other STATs.
In addition, both compounds exhibit greater uptake and
bioavailability in cancer cells when compared with normal
cells. HO-3867 demonstrated anticancer efﬁcacy in both a

xenograft model and cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant
primary ovarian cancer cell populations. These results support
the translational potential for HO-3867 as a safe, targeted
compound for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Materials and Methods
Transfection of cells with pBOS-H2BGFP vector and
chromatin aberration assay
A2780 and CHO cells were plated 1 day before and were
80% conﬂuent on the day of transfection. Cells were transfected with pBOS-H2BGFP vector DNA (1 mg/mL; BD Pharmingen) using Fugene 6 transfection reagent according to manufacturer's instructions.
STAT3 DNA-binding assays
After treatment with HO-3867 for 24 hours, a Nuclear Extract
Kit (Clontech Inc.) was used to prepare cell nuclear extracts
following the manufacturer's protocol (6, 7).
STAT3 knockdown experiments
For downregulation of STAT3 in SKOV3 cells, a lentiviral
system (pGIPZ) with a set of different short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA) was used (Thermo Scientiﬁc). A scrambled shRNA
was used as a control.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean  SE. Comparisons between
groups were made by the Student t test and ANOVA as
appropriate. The signiﬁcance level was set at P  0.05. Prism
Graph Pad was used for all statistical calculations.

Results
DAPs target STAT3
A new class of DAP compounds was synthesized by linking
two diarylidene groups with a piperidone group; an antioxidant-promoting N-hydroxypyrroline moiety was attached to
the piperidone N-terminal of the base compound H-4073
to obtain HO-3867 (Fig. 1A). Treatment of SKOV3 cells with
different concentrations of HO-3867 and H-4073 resulted in
signiﬁcantly decreased expression of pSTAT3 (Fig. 1B). DAP
compounds exhibited the highest binding afﬁnity for a pocket
located on the DNA-binding domain of the STAT3 molecule
(Fig. 1C). This is in contrast to other known STAT3 inhibitors,
many of which interact with STAT3 at the SH2 domain (8–10).
In addition, HO-3867 interacts with both the STAT3 dimer and
monomer structures (Fig. 1D); H-4073 docked with the STAT3
monomer is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A.
Western blots demonstrate that HO-3867 does not impact
expression of other pSTATs (Fig. 1E). Because in silico docking
simulations suggested that the compounds interact with the
DNA-binding domain of STAT3, we evaluated this in vitro.
SKOV3 cells were treated with 10 mmol/L of H-4073 or HO3867, and samples subjected to ELISA assay. DNA binding
activity was measured, and both compounds inhibited STAT3
DNA binding activity when compared with control (Fig. 1F).
Additional mechanistic studies focused upon HO-3867,
which was indicated to have the greater binding afﬁnity than

www.aacrjournals.org

H-4073 for the STAT3 DNA-binding domain. The difference in
binding afﬁnity is believed to be because of the inclusion of the
–NOH moiety in the HO-3867 structure. Puriﬁed STAT3 protein (2 mg) was incubated with HO-3867 (10 mmol/L) for 2
hours. STAT3 was immunoprecipitated, repeatedly washed to
remove unbound HO-3867, and subjected to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis at X-band (9.8 GHz). As
shown in Fig. 1G, a clear triplet EPR signal, characteristic of
nitroxide (–NO) compounds, was obtained from human
STAT3 incubated with HO-3867, suggesting DAP-STAT3
interaction. Figure 1H shows a reduction in luciferase expression when the cells were treated with HO-3867, whereas no
change in STAT4 and STAT5 transcriptional activity was
observed. Mechanistically, STAT3 nuclear translocation was
examined using a previously reported method (10, 11). A2780
cells were treated for 3 hours with 10 mmol/L of HO-3867, after
which STAT3 translocation was stimulated by adding IL-6 for
30 minutes. As shown in Fig. 1I, STAT3 nuclear translocation in
the HO-3867–treated cells was inhibited (right) when compared IL-6–stimulated cells. The intensity of nuclear pSTAT3
staining was quantiﬁed from the green channel. Treatment
with HO-3867 reduced overall pSTAT3 expression and nuclear
expression of pSTAT3 when compared with control or IL-6
stimulated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These results provide evidence that DAP compounds interact speciﬁcally with
STAT3 and inhibit its binding to DNA by preventing dimerization, nuclear translocation and/or phosphorylation.
Effect of DAPs on cancer cells versus normal cells
Development of STAT3 inhibitors that are selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells while sparing normal cells would be a
signiﬁcant step forward in cancer therapeutics. We hypothesize that the –NOH moiety of HO-3867 serves as a modulator of
cytotoxicity. H-4073, which possesses an identical backbone
structure but lacks the –NOH antioxidant precursor group, was
used for comparative purposes. Both DAP compounds inhibited proliferation in ovarian cancer cells in a dose- and timedependent manner. However, HO-3867 exhibited minimal
toxicity toward normal cells, whereas H-4073 was toxic to
both cell types (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Clonogenic
assays conﬁrm that HO-3867 is less toxic to normal CHO
cells when compared with H-4073 (22% vs. 92%, P < 0.05; Fig.
2A and B).
Successful transfection of the A2780 and CHO cells with
GFP-Histone 2B fusion protein was conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS; Supplementary Fig. S3). Transfected cells were treated with 10 mmol/L of HO-3867 or H-4073
for up to 24 hours, followed by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy. In Fig. 2C, red arrows indicate individual cells that
underwent abortive mitosis with transient chromatin condensation or apoptosis. Quantiﬁcation of chromosomal aberration
at different time points (means  SEM, n ¼ 100 cells/data
point), conﬁrms the differential action of HO-3867 on normal
versus cancer cells, P < 0.0001 (Fig. 2D). Using ﬂow cytometry,
apoptosis was quantiﬁed in A2780, hOSE, CHO, and H9c2 cells
treated with 10 mmol/L of HO-3867 or H-4073 for 24 hours. HO3867 induced less apoptosis in hOSE, CHO, and H9c2 cells
when compared with A2780 cells (12.3% vs. 55.8%, P < 0.0001),

types (63.6% vs. 48.5%, P < 0.0001; Supplementary Table S1
and Fig. S4A and S4B). When compared with other STAT3
inhibitors HO-3867 show similar toxicity to cancer cells, but
decreased toxicity to normal cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Furthermore, we evaluated oxidative stress in the cells using
8-hydroxyguanosine (8OHdG) after treating cells with HO3867 or H-4073 for 6 hours. After treatment with H-4073,
both cell lines showed similar of levels of 8OHdG. Conversely, HO-3867 treatment resulted in elevated 8OHdG staining
in cancer cells relative to normal cells (Fig. 2E). Based on our

induce apoptosis via activation of caspase-3 in cancer cells,
we examined the expression level of caspase-3 activity in

was found in HO-3867–treated ovarian cancer cells when
compared with HO-3867–treated normal cells and untreated
controls, but no difference was observed after H-4073 treatment (Fig. 2F). This suggests a differential involvement of
caspase-3 in HO-3867–induced apoptosis. It is clear that
although HO-3867 and H-4073 show similar toxicity toward
cancer cells, H-4073 is signiﬁcantly more toxic toward

spectroscopy (12). A substantial amount of the nitroxide form
of HO-3867 was detected in both cells using EPR, suggesting
that HO-3867 rapidly entered the cells during the 3 hour
exposure period (Fig. 3A).

HO-3867 Selectively Targets STAT3

The difference in signal amplitude observed in Fig. 3A would,
at ﬁrst, seem counterintuitive. It would be expected that a
lower concentration of the nitroxide form would be found in
the cancer cells, which have a more reductive environment
than the corresponding normal cells, thereby producing lower
signal amplitude. To further evaluate this, we quantiﬁed the
cellular uptake of both H-4073 and HO-3867 at the same dose
(10 mmol/L) and time point in both cells using UV/Vis spectrophotometry. The cellular uptake of HO-3867 was 5-fold and
H-4073 was 2-fold greater in cancer cells than in normal cells
after 3 hours of incubation (Fig. 3B). Uptake of HO-3867 by CHO
and A-2780 cell lines was also analyzed by a liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay.
Both cell lines were treated with 10 mmol/L of either HO-3867
or H-4073, and cells were harvested at the allocated time points
of 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours. Drug concentration was measured and
calculated against the calibration curve of HO-3867. A2780 cells
showed signiﬁcant uptake of HO-3867, but CHO cells had no
detectable levels of HO-3867 (Fig. 3C) and lower levels of H4073 when compared with A2780 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S6A). These results help to explain the greater EPR signal
amplitude from the cancer cells. Despite the more reductive
environment, a greater concentration of HO-3867 molecules, in
both forms, would be present in the cancer cells, thereby
providing a greater signal when compared with the noncancerous cells.
Next, in vitro metabolism studies were completed. In both
A2780 and CHO cell lines, the major metabolite observed
following incubation was the Mþ4 metabolite (Supplementary
Table S2). The concentration, as represented by the response
area of the Mþ4 metabolite, is much higher in CHO in
comparison to A2780 cells for both compounds (Fig. 3D and
E). This suggests that CHO cells metabolize HO-3867 faster
than H-4073, which may explain why no HO-3867 was detected
in the CHO cells by EPR spectroscopy. Extracted ion chromatograms of metabolites following exposure to H-4073 or HO3867 in both CHO and A2780 cells at different time points were
obtained (Supplementary Fig. S6B–S6E).
Differential effect of HO-3867 on STAT3/Akt signaling
pathway in cancer cells versus normal cells
The differential bio-absorption study results obtained using
EPR and LC/MS do not fully explain the selective mechanism of
action of HO-3867. To elucidate this further, we examined the
effect of HO-3867 on the STAT3/Akt signaling pathway, speciﬁcally looking at STAT3 activation and STAT3-mediated
genes. After treatment of A2780 and SKOV3 cells with 10
mmol/L of HO-3867, analysis showed decreased levels of pSTAT3, p-Akt Ser473, and Bcl-2, with a concomitant increase in
p53 or p21. Conversely, hOSE and CHO cells showed no change

in p-STAT3, p53, or Bcl-2 levels, but an increase in pAkt Ser473
(Fig. 4A and B). This suggests that activation of pAkt in normal
cells protects them from apoptosis, whereas inhibition of
pSTAT3 and pAkt in HO-3867-treated A2780 or SKOV3 cells,
promotes apoptosis. Changes in phosphorylated Akt expression were conﬁrmed by confocal microscopy, as shown in Fig.
4C. Conversely, treatment with H-4073 showed decreased
levels of pSTAT3 and elevated cleaved-caspase-7 in both CHO
and A2780 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A).
Akt siRNA reverses the selective cytotoxicity of HO-3867
in CHO cells
Akt siRNA was transfected into CHO cells for 24 hours to
determine if the apparent selective activation of Akt is necessary
for HO-3867–mediated cytotoxicity. Cells were treated with 10
mmol/L of HO-3867 for 24 hours. Western blot analysis conﬁrmed transfection. In CHO cells transfected with Akt siRNA
before treatment with HO-3867, lower levels of total Akt and
pAkt were observed when compared with untransfected controls. This decrease in pAkt resulted in an increase in the
apoptosis markers cleaved-caspase-7 and cleaved-PARP (Fig.
4D). Decreased viability and doubling of the number of cells
undergoing apoptosis was observed in transfected cells treated
with HO-3867 (Fig. 4E and F). This indicates that activation of
Akt is essential in the reduced cytotoxicity of HO-3867 in normal
cells. Next, we sought to determine if the selective activation or
inhibition of pAkt was because of alterations in kinase pathways
induced by HO-3867. Akt kinase activity was evaluated after
treatment with HO-3867, and activation or suppression of
various kinases was noted in A2780 (Fig. 4G) but not CHO cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7B). This suggests that the selective
toxicity exhibited by HO-3867 is related to differential effects
on the STAT3/Akt pathway in ovarian cancer cells. Further
study is required in other cell lines to conﬁrm the activation of
Akt by HO-3867 in noncancerous cell lines.
Effect of HO-3867 treatment on STAT3 knockdown
ovarian cancer cells
To investigate the requirement of STAT3 in HO-3867–mediated apoptosis, we knocked down STAT3 in ovarian cancer
cells using shRNA. Western blot analysis conﬁrmed knockdown. (Fig. 5A). STAT3 knockdown cells were treated with 10
mmol/L of HO-3867 for 24 hours, then cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed. Among SKOV3 STAT3 knockdown cells,
viability was increased (Fig. 5B) with a 50% reduction of
apoptosis following treatment with HO-3867 when compared
with wild-type cells (Fig. 5C and D). These results conﬁrm that
HO-3867 inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of
apoptosis is mediated primarily by targeting the STAT3
pathway.

treated mice showed decreased levels of STAT3 Tyr705 and
Bcl-2 levels, without affecting total STAT3 (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S8). To conﬁrm uptake of HO-3867, tumor
tissues and organs from HO-3867 treated and untreated mice
were collected and prepared for EPR spectroscopic analysis as
described previously (12). Clear, triplet signals indicating the
presence of the –NO radical (nitroxide) form of HO-3867 were
obtained from liver, ovary, kidney, and spleen tissues. Brain,
heart, and lung tissues seem to produce possible, but extremely
weak signals (Supplementary Fig. S9). In addition, HO-3867
uptake by the tumor tissues was quantiﬁed using UV/Vis

The toxicity of HO-3867 in various organs and tumor tissues
was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end

the translational potential for HO-3867 as a safe, targeted
compound for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Discussion
Drug development is a long and arduous journey. Many
compounds are developed and evaluated on a yearly basis to
ﬁnd a promising few that are suitable for human clinical trials.
Our compound, HO-3867, shows great promise in preclinical
evaluations for the treatment of ovarian cancer. It has shown
toxicity toward recurrent primary ovarian cancer cell populations, excellent oral bio-absorption, and bio-availability in a
xenograft model, as well as in vivo toxicity in platinum-resistant tumors. However, many compounds have these properties—the novel innovation that sets HO-3867 apart is its
selective toxicity toward cancer cells while sparing normal
cells in both in vitro and in vivo experiments by taking advantage of one of the underlying biomolecular causes of disease.
At present, only a few agents are known to possess the
potential for selective/preferential elimination of cancer cells
without affecting normal cells (13–15). Sanguinarine, an alkaloid derived from the root of Sanguinaria canadendid and used
commonly in mouth washes and toothpaste is one such
compound. In vitro data show that it displays toxicity toward
human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells but not normal
human epidermal keratinocytes (16).
In this study, we were able to elucidate the mechanism behind
the selective toxicity of HO-3867 and translate this to in vivo
model showing little or no toxicity at clinically effective doses.
The mechanism is multifaceted, but is based on the addition of
the N-hydroxypyrroline (–NOH) moiety to H-4073, to obtain HO3867. This moiety functions as a modulator of cytotoxicity,
allowing the compound to exist in an equilibrium of oxidized
(–NO) and reduced forms (–NOH) depending on the cellular
environment (17). In normal cells, the N-hydroxypyrroline group
has the greater potential to oxidize, generating a nitroxide that
imparts antioxidant protection to noncancerous tissues (17–20).
In cancer cells and hypoxic tumors, the microenvironment is far
more reductive in nature, inhibiting oxidation and reducing
antioxidant protection to tumor cells (21–23).
The difference between oxidized and reduced forms of
nitroxyl radicals has been well established using EPR (24–
26). Previous (1) and current study from our lab revealed that
after in vitro treatment with HO-3867, cancer cells have higher
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevated 8OHdG
expression when compared with normal cells as measured by
DHE and 8OHdG staining. This suggests that HO-3867 acts as
an antioxidant in normal cells, but not in cancer cells. In this
study, we show that the bio-absorption of HO-3867 is greater in
cancer cells and more slowly metabolized, which likely contributes to the enhanced toxicity; allowing greater accumulation of ROS. This is in contrast to platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents, which promote ROS accumulation in both
cancer and normal cells, leading to signiﬁcant systemic toxicity. A previous study found that mice cotreated with cisplatin
and HO-3867 did not have a reduction in body weight compared with control, whereas those treated with the same dose

2326

Cancer Res; 74(8) April 15, 2014

of cisplatin alone did lose weight during treatment (27). Given
these ﬁndings it is possible that combining cisplatin with HO3867 may protect against cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity.
Another facet to the selective toxicity is a differential impact
at the molecular level. HO-3867 preferentially inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3, and to a lesser extent pAkt, in cancer
cells, but activates Akt expression in normal cells. This leads to
selective cell killing of cancer cells while protecting normal
cells. This is congruent with previous work from our lab,
showing that cotreatment with HO-3867 and doxorubicin
prevents development of doxorubicin-associated cardiomyopathy in mice through a similar mechanism (4). These data
establish a critical and unique dependency on Akt activation
for the protection of normal cells and inhibition of STAT3
activation for anticancer effect.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic study showing the selective induction of apoptosis in ovarian cancer
cells versus normal cells using an orally deliverable STAT3
inhibitor. Most importantly, we show that HO-3867 is highly
effective in primary cancer cell populations, including cells
known to be resistant to conventional chemotherapeutics.
Viable treatment options for this latter cancer cell type are
currently very limited or unavailable, suggesting potential
translational application of HO-3867 for the safe treatment
of ovarian cancer, including recurrent disease. However,
additional studies are needed to conﬁrm the selective cytotoxicity of HO-3867 via Akt signaling mechanisms in vivo.
Safe and targeted inhibitors are an essential tool for future
therapeutic intervention, particularly in the treatment of
cancers. The present results provide a convincing argument
for preclinical evaluation of HO-3867 in the treatment of
ovarian cancer, including cancer that has developed resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic intervention.
