ABSTRACT
The inhibitor-of-apoptosis family member survivin has been reported to inhibit
apoptosis and regulate mitosis and cytokinesis. In multiple myeloma, survivin
has been described to be involved in downstream sequelae of various therapeutic
agents. We assessed 1093 samples from previously untreated patients, including two
independent cohorts of 392 and 701 patients, respectively. Survivin expression was
associated with cell proliferation, adverse prognostic markers, and inferior eventfree and overall survival, supporting the evaluation of survivin as a therapeutic
target in myeloma. The small molecule suppressant of survivin - YM155 - is in clinical
development for the treatment of solid tumors. YM155 potently inhibited proliferation
and induced apoptosis in primary myeloma cells and cell lines. Gene expression and
protein profiling revealed the critical roles of IL6/STAT3-signaling and the unfolded
protein response in the efficacy of YM155. Both pathways converged to down regulate
anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 in myeloma cells. Conversely, growth inhibition and apoptotic
cell death by YM155 was rescued by ectopic expression of Mcl-1 but not survivin,
identifying Mcl-1 as the pivotal downstream target of YM155 in multiple myeloma.
Mcl-1 expression was likewise associated with adverse prognostic markers, and
inferior survival. Our results strongly support the clinical evaluation of YM155 in
patients with multiple myeloma.

INTRODUCTION

Although very heterogeneous with respect to
molecular characteristics, a common feature of MM cells
is the relatively slow rate of cell proliferation in most
newly diagnosed patients [2, 3]. Equally important for
MM cell survival and therapeutic resistance are impaired
mechanisms of apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
member Mcl-1, in particular, seems to be essential for MM
cell survival [4-7].

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disease
that is characterized by clonal expansion of terminally
differentiated B cells. Despite major advances in overall
survival (OS) achieved by the introduction of novel
agents within the last decade, MM remains an incurable
malignancy in most cases [1].

RESULTS

Survivin is a member of the IAP (inhibitors of
apoptosis) protein family, encoded by the BIRC5 gene, and
is highly expressed in cancer cells while virtually absent
in most differentiated normal tissues [8, 9]. Furthermore,
expression levels of survivin have been found to correlate
with poor prognosis in colorectal, non-small-cell lung,
prostate, and breast cancer, as well as in MM [10-14].
Functionally, survivin has been shown to counteract
apoptosis induction upstream of effector caspases [15]
and to have an essential role in cell proliferation by
regulating spindle assembly and microtubule attachment
to the kinetochore as a member of the chromosomal
passenger complex [16, 17]. In MM, survivin has been
implicated in the mechanisms of action of several
therapeutic approaches. Specifically, inhibition of AKT,
STAT-3 and NFkB signaling is associated with reduced
intracellular gene expression and protein levels of survivin
[18-20]. Long-term knockdown of survivin resulted in
moderate inhibition of MM cell growth and increased drug
sensitivity [21].
Although survivin appears to be an attractive
therapeutic target from this initial set of data, it has
never been analyzed in a large cohort of patients for its
prognostic and therapeutic value. The portfolio of clinical
grade survivin specific antagonists has been surprisingly
limited [9]. Recently, a novel imidazolium-based small
molecule suppressant of survivin, YM155, has been
described. This compound was identified in a cell-based
promoter activity assay and was described to specifically
abrogate survivin gene (BIRC5) expression, resulting in
preclinical activity in several tumor models both in vitro
and in vivo [22, 23]. YM155 is currently being evaluated
in phase II clinical trials in lymphoma, melanoma, as well
as in cancers of the breast, lung, and prostate.
Based on these data we sought to re-assess the
prognostic significance of BIRC5 gene expression
in CD138-purified MM cells from a cohort of 1093
previously untreated patients and to pre-clinically
evaluate YM155 for its therapeutic potential in MM.
BIRC5 expression proved to be a powerful prognostic
marker for event-free (EFS) and OS in two independent
cohorts of patients. YM155 potently abrogates MM cell
growth associated with inhibition of survivin expression.
Furthermore, delineation of molecular sequelae in MM
cells showed that down regulation of Mcl-1 appears to be
an even more important downstream effector mechanism
in MM cells exposed to YM155. Mcl-1 is expressed in all
1093 MM cell samples and is likewise associated with an
adverse clinical prognosis.
Taken together, YM155 displays great therapeutic
potential on MM cells via inhibition of survivin and, more
importantly, Mcl-1 expression. Further clinical evaluation
of this compound in MM is strongly warranted.

Aberrant expression of survivin gene transcripts
in multiple myeloma
The survivin gene (BIRC5, probe set 202095_s_at)
was not expressed in normal bone marrow plasma cells
(n = 10, absent call 10/10), but was aberrantly expressed
in 158/370 (42.7 %, present call) MM cell samples in our
patient cohort. The mean expression in MM cells is 4-fold
higher compared to that in normal plasma cells (P < 0.001)
and 2-fold compared to plasma cells from patients with
MGUS (p < 0.001), respectively (Figure 1A). In turn,
BIRC5 is expressed in all samples of proliferating normal
or malignant plasma cells, i.e. polyclonal plasmablastic
cells (PPC, non-malignant, n = 10), or human myeloma
cell lines (n = 32) (Figure 1A). In both cases, the
expression is significantly higher compared to MM
cell samples (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). BIRC5 expression
in primary MM cells correlates significantly with
proliferation as assessed by the gene expression profiling
derived proliferation index, GPI (r = 0.81, p < 0.001) or
propidium iodide staining [2] (r = 0.59, p < 0.001; n =
36), and the expression is significantly different between a
low/median/high GPI (Figure 1A). BIRC5 gene expression
also increases with higher Durie-Salmon stage (p < 0.001,
Suppl. Figure S1A). BIRC5 expression was validated by
qRT-PCR [14]. In agreement with microarray and qRTPCR-data, survivin protein could be detected in 12/12 MM
cell lines, being absent in 2/2 bone marrow stromal cell
samples used as control (Figure 1B).

Survivin expression, patient survival, and risk
factors
In 301 patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy,
the presence of BIRC5 expression was associated with
inferior EFS and OS (22.6 vs. 35.4 months, p < 0.001;
52.9 vs. not reached, p = 0.002) using an optimized cutoff
defined by maximum logrank statistics (Figure 1C). This
strategy was also applied to 701 patients of the UAMS
Arkansas group treated within the total therapy 2 or
therapy 3 protocols with EFS of 12.3 vs. 54.1 months (P
< 0.001) and OS of 17.4 vs. n.r. (p = 0.002) (Figure 1D).
BIRC5 expression is also significantly higher in patients
harboring a del17p or gain of 1q21 (Suppl. Figure S1B).
BIRC5 expression is likewise higher in patients designated
as “high risk” by the gene expression based risk scores of
the UAMS (UAMS 70 gene score [24] or the IFM-score
(IFM 15 gene score) [25] (Suppl. Figure S1C and S1D).

YM155 specifically inhibits cell growth and
induces apoptosis in myeloma cells

by caspase 3/7 activation in the two most sensitive cell
lines, U-266 and INA-6, as well as in primary myeloma
cells, at concentrations comparable to those that inhibited
proliferation (Figure 2D). Less sensitive cell lines, such as
OPM-2, required a 10-fold higher concentration (500 nM)
for induction of apoptosis (Suppl. Figure 2)

The small molecule survivin suppressant YM155
has been shown to effectively reduce cellular survivin
expression at the mRNA and protein levels [22]. In our
panel of 10 MM cell lines, increasing concentrations of
YM155 reduced cell growth (i.e., viable cells after 48h)
in all cell lines within a range of IC50 values of 2 nM to 50
nM (Figure 2A). Likewise, YM155 specifically inhibited
proliferation in these cell lines already within 24 hours
of exposure at similar IC50 values, assessed by [3H]thymidine uptake (Figure 2B). Moreover, the viability
of CD138-positive cells isolated from the bone marrow
samples of three heavily pre-treated MM patients was
also strongly reduced upon treatment with YM155, with
only minor effects on corresponding primary bone marrow
stromal cells, used as non-malignant controls (Figure
2C). In addition, YM155 induced apoptosis as detected

IL-6 sensitizes OPM-2 cells to YM155
As the growth factors IL-6 and IGF-1 are known
to promote MM cell growth and survival and to confer
drug resistance, we next examined whether YM155 can
overcome these protective effects. While both cytokines
triggered MM cell growth in serum-free media in untreated
controls, neither IL-6 nor IGF-1 were able to attenuate the
growth inhibitory effect of YM155 in U-266 and OPM-2
cells (Figure 2E,F). Moreover, IL-6 strikingly sensitized
OPM-2 cells to treatment with YM155 (Figure 2F).
U-266 cells have been reported to utilize a constitutively

activated IL-6/Stat-3 pathway by the autocrine secretion
of IL-6 [27]. Considering that U-266 cells as well as
the IL-6-dependent INA-6 cells were highly sensitive to
YM155 under normal growth conditions, the fact that IL-6
stimulation in serum-free conditions sensitized OPM-2
cells to YM155 treatment suggested that YM155 might
interfere with the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.

suggesting the involvement of this pathway in the antiMM effects of YM155 (Figure 3). To confirm these
data, we assessed key markers of the ER stress response
on MM cells by immunoblot assay (Figure 4). PERKdependent phosphorylation of eIF2a and induction of its
downstream target CHOP together with the stress-related
transcription factor ATF-3 were detected in U-266 cells
within 24 hours at 4nM and within 6 to 12 hours (50 nM)
of YM155 exposure. The up-regulation of CHOP, which
has previously been shown to inhibit proliferation and
to induce apoptosis in MM cells [29, 30], was closely
associated with PARP cleavage, indicating the onset of
apoptotic signaling. Similar results were obtained in INA6 cells. Thapsigargin (TG) was used as a positive control
for markers of ER stress response (Figure 4)

YM155 induces ER stress response signaling in
myeloma cells
To gain further insight into the mechanism of
action of YM155 in MM cells, we performed serial gene
expression profiling after 6 (4 nM and 50 nM), 12 (4 nM
and 50 nM), and 36 hours (4 nM) of YM155 treatment
in U-266 cells. Among significantly differentially
regulated genes (P < 0.01), 189 were up-regulated
and 63 down-regulated > 1.5-fold. Pathway analysis
using the Ingenuity Systems software revealed upregulation of genes associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress/ unfolded protein response (UPR)

YM155 inhibits IL-6/STAT3-signaling
Gene expression profiling further suggested
concordant down-regulation of genes that have been
described to be regulated by the transcription factor

MCM7 served as loading control. thapsigargin (Tg) treated cells served as positive control samples.

YM155 targets Mcl-1 in MM cells

STAT3 (Figure 5) [28]. While IL-6 signals via at least 3
pathways in multiple myeloma, namely STAT3, ERK1/2,
and AKT [31, 32], we first biologically validated the
impact of YM155 on IL-6/STAT3-signalling, finding a
concentration-dependent decrease of phospho-STAT3
in both cell lines after 24 hours under normal growth
conditions. This correlated closely with inhibition of
survivin and Mcl-1 protein expression (Figure 6A).
Phosphorylated STAT3 translocates from the cytoplasm
to the nucleus. Immunofluorescence staining of STAT3
showed that nuclear STAT3 was depleted upon treatment
with YM155 U-266 and INA-6 cells (Suppl. Figure 3).
There was also a strong time-dependent correlation
between the inhibition of STAT3 activation and the
decrease of Mcl-1. Apoptosis induction as assessed by
PARP cleavage was observed to have a close temporal
correlation with the reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation
and Mcl-1 suppression (Figure 6B).
In contrast, we found a transient increase in the
phosphorylation of AKT in both U-266 and INA-6 cells
upon YM155 treatment, in particular at 50 nM of YM155.
Similarly, phosphorylation of ERK was markedly induced
in INA-6, while it was less pronounced in U-266 cells,
indicating the activation of alternative signaling pathways
(Figure 6B).

As IL-6 stimulation sensitized OPM-2 cells to
treatment with YM155, we examined the phosphorylation
of STAT3 and the protein expression of survivin and Mcl-1
in IL-6 stimulated cells exposed to YM155. IL-6 strongly
induced STAT3 phosphorylation in OPM-2 cells (Figure
7A). YM155 inhibited this effect at a concentration of 20
nM in accordance to the sensitization to YM155 seen in
the previous cell growth assays. Mcl-1 expression has been
reported to be regulated by IL-6/STAT3 signaling [33]
Here, Mcl-1 was markedly induced upon IL-6 stimulation
and this effect was completely abrogated by treatment
with 20nM of YM155. The constitutive expression of
survivin in OPM-2 cells was not significantly enhanced
by IL-6 and was not altered by exposure to YM155 in
this concentration range (Figure 7A). This data suggests
that down regulation of Mcl-1 rather than that of survivin
might be the mechanism of action of YM155 in OPM-2
cells.
Survivin and Mcl-1 are proteins with a high turnover
rate and are rapidly eliminated by proteasomal degradation
[34, 35]. Activation of the ER stress response leads to a
general inhibition of protein translation. We asked whether

ER stress alone can lead to changes in survivin and
Mcl-1 levels. We observed a rapid decrease of Mcl-1 in
U-266 and INA-6 cells upon treatment with thapsigargin
(Figure 7B). In contrast, only a moderate decline in
survivin protein expression was seen in U-266 cells and
no significant change in INA-6. Thapsigargin did not
change phosphorylation of STAT3. This indicates that the
activation of the ER stress response triggered by YM155
also contributes to the down regulation of Mcl-1.
YM155 induces alterations in two pathways –
triggering the ER stress/UPR and selectively abrogating
STAT3-dependent transcription factor activity – that seem
to ultimately result in a depletion of the anti-apoptotic
protein Mcl-1 in MM cells. We next sought to determine
whether ectopic Mcl-1 expression is able to attenuate the
anti-MM cell activity of YM155. As shown in figure 7C,
exogenous Mcl-1 remarkably attenuates the inhibitory

effect of YM155 on U-266 cell growth. Exogenous Mcl1 protein levels were maintained in transfected cells
and displayed reduced apoptotic cell death as assessed
by PARP cleavage (Figure 7D). In contrast, exogenous
expression of survivin had no significant impact on
YM155 efficacy in MM cell growth (Figure 7C). This
confirms that Mcl-1 depletion has a crucial role in the
mechanism of action of YM155 in MM cells.

MCL1 gene expression and survival
Though ubiquitous, there is a consistently lower
level of expression in MM cells and myeloma cell
lines when compared to normal bone marrow plasma
cells (Suppl. Figure S4A). Contrary to survivin, MCL1
expression does not show an association with proliferation,

but with adverse cytogenetic features (gain of 1q21 and
presence of t(4;14)) and, at a statistically significant level
despite a relatively small absolute difference, with gene
expression based risk scores (Suppl. Figure S4B, S4C and
S4D).
In 301 patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy,
MCL1 expression was associated with inferior EFS and
OS (21.5 vs. 34.3 months, p = 0.005; 58.9 vs. n.r., p =
0.007) using an optimized cutoff defined by maximum
logrank statistics. Similar results were obtained using data
from 701 patients of the UAMS Arkansas group treated
within the total therapy 2 and 3 protocols EFS of 65.1
vs. 79.2 months (p < 0.001) and OS of 86.4 vs. n.r. (p <
0.001) (Suppl. Figure S5A and S5B). This data confirm
that elevated MCL1 expression is associated with inferior
EFS and OS in MM patients.

However, bortezomib requires the cleavage product of
Mcl-1 to efficiently trigger apoptosis in MM cells [6]
while YM155 abrogates Mcl-1 on a transcriptional level.
In order to more specifically assess the potency of dual
induction of ER stress, we combined YM155 (4nM and
20nM, respectively) with thapsigargin in both cell lines.
As expected, moderately synergistic effects (CI 0.63 –
0.77) were seen with this combination (Figure 8A).
Recently, the co-dependency of MM cells on the
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Mcl-1and Bcl-2/
Bcl-xL has been reported [37]. Strikingly, co-treatment
of OPM-2 cells with YM155 (20nM) and the antagonist
of Bcl-2 proteins, ABT-263 (0.4 µM and 0.8 µM), led to
a marked synergistic growth inhibition (CI 0.14 – 0.15)
(Figure 8A) as well as to a highly synergistic activation
of apoptotic signaling assessed by caspase 3/7 activity
(Figure 8B and C). In contrast, the combination of these
two compounds in U-266 cells was less effective but still
synergistic (CI 0.60 – 0.61).
In summary, these results strongly support the early
evaluation of YM155 in combination with inhibitors of
other Bcl-2 family members in clinical trials.

YM155 in combination with other compounds
Bortezomib is known to trigger the ER stress
response [36]. Low-dose YM155 (2nM and 10nM,
respectively) was combined with low-doses of bortezomib
(1nM and 2nM) in U-266 and OPM-2 cells. Isobologram
analysis of cell growth demonstrated moderate antagonistic
effects (CI 1.18 – 1.40) for this combination (Figure 8A).

DISCUSSION

siRNA did not significantly inhibit growth and survival of
MM cells (data not shown).
Based on these results, we re-evaluated the
expression, association with molecular entities and
prognostic significance of Mcl-1 in multiple myeloma.
In contrast to survivin, MCL1 expression does not show
an association with proliferation, but with adverse
cytogenetic features. In line with these findings, high
MCL1 expression is associated with adverse survival,
confirming and extending data previously reported [45].
How does YM155 suppress expression of survivin
and Mcl-1? Firstly, both Mcl-1 and survivin expression
have been found to be regulated by STAT3 [33, 46, 47].
Specifically in MM, STAT3 dependent expression of Mcl1 has been reported in INA-6 cells [48]. In addition, Mcl1 and survivin, both proteins with short half-lives, are
conceivably suppressed by the general inhibition of protein
translation triggered by the unfolded protein response, as
our data demonstrate that induction of ER stress alone
leads to reduced protein levels of Mcl-1 and survivin.
Furthermore, YM155 appears to disrupt the formation of
a critical complex of transcription factors at the survivin
core promoter by modulating subcellular localizations
of Sp1 and ILF3/p54(nrb) [42, 49]. Interestingly, both
Mcl-1 and survivin share transcriptional regulation by
SP1, providing an additional molecular basis for the dual
suppression of these critical pro-survival factors in cancer
cells [50].
As the early first clinical trial data suggest that the
single agent activity of YM155 is modest, appropriate
combination partners based on preclinical synergy are
likely to be required for the successful clinical application
of this compound. Recently, a complex interaction pattern
between anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in MM
cells has been reported [37]. This work describes a codependency of MM cells on Mcl-1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL.
In line with these recent reports, our findings confirm
a strikingly synergistic efficacy of the combination of
YM155 with the antagonist of Bcl-2 proteins ABT-263, an
orally active derivative of ABT-737 that selectively binds
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w [51, 52]. We therefore propose to
further evaluate YM155 in combination with inhibitors of
the Bcl-2 family in future clinical trials.
Taken together, these results provide the theoretical
framework for clinical trials targeting survivin and Mcl-1
in patients with MM.

BIRC5/SURVIVIN is one of the most frequently
over-expressed genes in all types of cancer [8]. The
oncogenic activity of elevated survivin expression occurs
through regulation of mitotic spindle assembly and
cytokinesis, as well as through exerting anti-apoptotic
effects by indirectly inhibiting caspase activation [38,
39]. In MM, BIRC5 expression, detectable in 43% of
myeloma cell samples, is associated with proliferation,
prognostically adverse chromosomal aberrations (del17p
and gain of 1q21), and gene expression based high-risk
scores. BIRC5 expression carries adverse prognostic
significance regarding event-free and overall survival. It
is thus a potential target for personalized and risk adapted
treatment.
To explore survivin as a therapeutic target, we
evaluated the cytotoxicity and mechanism of action of
and some potential combination partners for the novel
small molecule suppressant of survivin, YM155, now
called sepantronium bromide. YM155 potently inhibits
cell growth and induces apoptotic cell death in MM cells
in a low nanomolar range, similar to what has been shown
preclinically for prostate, colon, lung and a wide variety of
other cancer entities [23]. These studies have already led
to several phase II clinical trials with data now available
on relapsed and refractory prostate cancer and diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma [40, 41]. The excellent tolerability
of the compound was demonstrated in these trials and
single agent anti-tumor activity was reported. However,
though there was one complete response in the lymphoma
trial, overall relatively few patients responded. Ongoing
clinical trials will therefore focus on drug combinations
based on pre-clinically proven synergy.
We further aimed to dissect the molecular
mechanism of action in MM cells. Although Cheng
et al. describe YM155 as highly selective to suppress
survivin promoter activity, the concomitant abrogation
of Mcl-1 transcription was recently shown by Tang et
al. in a panel of cell lines from solid tumors [42, 43].
While YM155 does suppress survivin levels in MM
cells at higher concentrations, our data indicate that
YM155 additionally triggers the ER stress response and
abrogates both IL-6 induced as well as constitutive STAT3
signaling, ultimately converging on the inhibition of Mcl-1
expression, an anti-apoptotic factor that has been proven
to be essential for MM cell survival [4, 44]. The potent
anti-tumor activity of YM155, at least in MM, therefore
seems to be mediated by the activation of the unfolded
protein response and simultaneous abrogation of IL-6/
STAT3 signaling. Mcl-1, rather than survivin, appears to
play the major role in YM155-mediated growth inhibition
and cell death in MM cells. This is further underlined by
the reversal of YM-155 inhibition by forced expression
of Mcl-1, whereas forced expression of survivin had no
effect. In addition, knock-down of BIRC5/survivin by

Statistical analysis

Sigma Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Primary antibodies were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA): Survivin, p-STAT3, STAT3, p-ERK, p-AKT
(Ser 473), PARP, p-eIF2α, CHOP and from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): Actin, Mcl-1, GAPDH,
MCM7, ATF-3.

To assess for the presence or absence of gene
expression, the “Presence-Absence calls with Negative
Probesets” algorithm was used [59]. Differences in
clinical parameters and cytogenetic analyses and between
defined groups were investigated by exact Wilcoxon
rank-sum test. Correlation was assessed using Pearson’s
correlation or Kendall’s tau (for categorical variables)
tests. The relationship between categorical variables
was assessed using Fisher’s exact test. Differential gene
expression was assessed using empirical Bayes statistics
in linear models for microarray data [60]. P-values
were adjusted for multiple testing controlling the false
discovery rate as defined by Benjamini and Hochberg [61].
All computations were performed using R 2.14.1 (http://
www.r-project.org/), and Bioconductor 2.9 [62]. EFS and
OS were investigated using Cox’s proportional hazard
model as previously published [53]. For EFS and OS, cutoffs were calculated as the mean cut-off from EFS and
OS, respectively. Gene expression-based assessment of
risk and proliferation as well as classifications of myeloma
was performed as previously published [2]. Findings were
confirmed using the same strategy on the independent
group of 701 patients treated within the total therapy 2
and 3 protocols, respectively [63, 64]. Microarray data
are available in the public databases under accession
numbers E-TABM-1138 and GSE24080. An effect was
considered as statistically significant if the P-value of its
corresponding statistical test was not higher than 5 %.

Cell Culture
Human MM cell lines were purchased from the
German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures
(Braunschweig, Germany) and cultured as recommended.
INA-6 cells, kindly provided by Dr. Renate Burger,
University Hospital Schleswig Holstein Kiel (Kiel,
Germany), were grown in RPMI-1640, 10% FCS
(GIBCO/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), with 2.5 ng/
ml IL-6. The human MM cell line HG-1 was generated
in the Multiple Myeloma Research Laboratory Heidelberg
(unpublished data). All cell lines were periodically
tested for contamination with mycoplasma by PCR
and authenticated by DNA fingerprinting within our
cell banking system according to the regulations of the
German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ).

Primary cells, human myeloma cell lines, Gene
Expression Profiling, iFISH
Patients with previously untreated MM (n=370),
individuals with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown
significance (MGUS, n=22), and 10 healthy donors
presenting at the University Hospitals of Heidelberg
and Montpellier were included in the study after written
informed consent was obtained in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, which was approved by the
institutional review boards of the University Hospital
of Montpellier, France and of the Medical Faculty of
the Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg (#229/2003
and S-152/2010), Germany. A total of 301 patients
underwent front line high-dose conditioning chemotherapy
with 200 mg/m² melphalan and autologous stem cell
transplantation. Purification of normal bone marrow
plasma cells, MM cells, plasmablasts and bone marrow
stromal cells as well as gene expression profiling were
performed as previously described [2, 53-55]. Interphase
fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were done on
CD138-purified plasma cells as published [56]. CD27+
memory B cells (MBCs, n=11) were purified from buffy
coats purchased from the French Blood Center (Toulouse,
France) and plasmablasts (PPC, n=10) generated using
an in vitro model described previously [57]. Thirty two
human myeloma cell lines were fully characterized and
microarray profiled as described [58]. Microarray data
on cell lines are available in the ArrayExpress public
database under accession numbers E-TABM-937 and
E-TABM-1088.

Transfections
U-266 cell were transfected with the pCMV
survivin, the pCMV Mcl-1 plasmid [65] or a control
plasmid (pCMV-Tag4A, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using
the Neon Transfection System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Cell-based Assays
Cell growth and Caspase 3/7 assays were conducted
in 96-well plates according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using CellTiter-Glo™ and Caspase-Glo 3/7™
assays from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell proliferation
was assessed by measuring [3H]-thymidine uptake, as
described in prior studies [36].

Isobologram analysis
For combination studies, data from CellTiter
Glo™ assays were converted into values representing the
fraction of growth affected (FA) in drug-treated versus
untreated cells and analyzed using the CalcuSyn software
program (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) based on the Chou10246

SDS-PAGE and Western Immunoblot
Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot
analysis were performed as described previously [36].
Briefly, after washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells
were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (Tris/HCl pH
8.0 50 nM; NaCl 150 mM; Nonidet P40 1% (v/v); EDTA
1mM; sodium deoxycholate 0.25% (w/v)) containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Complete Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets and PhoSTOP Phosphatase
Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets, Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
afterwards blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE
Health Care, Buckinghamshire, UK). All membranes were
blocked with 5% milk in TBST (Tris/HCl pH 7.4; NaCl
137 mM; KCl 2.7 mM; Tween 0.1% (v/v)) for one hour
before incubation with the respective primary antibodies.
The horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary
antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA) and the ECL-Kit from Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bonn, Germany).
