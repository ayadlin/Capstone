ABSTRACT
Radiotherapy in children causes debilitating cognitive decline, partly linked to
impaired neurogenesis. Irradiation targets primarily cancer cells but also endogenous
neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) leading to cell death or cell cycle arrest. Here
we evaluated the effects of lithium on proliferation, cell cycle and DNA damage after
irradiation of young NSPCs in vitro.
NSPCs were treated with 1 or 3 mM LiCl and we investigated proliferation
capacity (neurosphere volume and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation). Using
flow cytometry, we analysed apoptosis (annexin V), cell cycle (propidium iodide) and
DNA damage (γH2AX) after irradiation (3.5 Gy) of lithium-treated NSPCs.
Lithium increased BrdU incorporation and, dose-dependently, the number of cells
in replicative phase as well as neurosphere growth. Irradiation induced cell cycle
arrest in G1 and G2/M phases. Treatment with 3 mM LiCl was sufficient to increase
NSPCs in S phase, boost neurosphere growth and reduce DNA damage. Lithium did
not affect the levels of apoptosis, suggesting that it does not rescue NSPCs committed
to apoptosis due to accumulated DNA damage.
Lithium is a very promising candidate for protection of the juvenile brain from
radiotherapy and for its potential to thereby improve the quality of life for those
children who survive their cancer.

Irradiation of the juvenile brain is known to cause
more severe damage in comparison to the adult brain.
This may, at least partly, be explained by the higher neural
stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) turnover in the young,
differences in dynamic cell-autonomous regulation, as
well as regional differences in growth [6–10]. NSPCs
continuously repopulate the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the
hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) in the postnatal brain,
displaying an age-dependent decline [11, 12]. Studies of
hippocampal neurogenesis ablation using irradiation have
shown that it plays a role in memory and information

INTRODUCTION
The late-appearing neurocognitive decline observed
in longitudinal follow-ups in children who receive cranial
radiotherapy as tumour treatment remains a salient
clinical issue and demands development of appropriate
intervention strategies [1, 2]. The treatment-related
sequelae encompass reduced memory formation capacity,
attention deficits and a general reduction in ability to
process information [3–5].

processing, providing a link between hippocampal
neurogenesis and the decline of cognitive functions after
radiotherapy [12–16]. Additionally, irradiation of the
developing brain revealed that hippocampal neurogenesis
was permanently halted and even displayed accelerated
age-dependent decline [17], thus making this structure
highly vulnerable. Compelling evidence supports the
notion that irradiation-induced deregulation of the
hippocampal NSPC cell cycle and growth leads to a
further cascade of events in the neurogenic process that
likely correlates with neurocognitive decline [18, 19]. In
particular, the irradiation-induced long-term changes of the
neurogenic niche are attributable to several factors, such
as chronic inflammation secondary to increased apoptosis
and sustained production of reactive-oxygen species
(ROS) as well as direct DNA damage in NSPCs, which
causes the cells to adopt a senescent phenotype and elevate
cytokine secretion levels, ultimately resulting in increased
glial differentiation in vivo [20–24]. Furthermore, the
irradiation-induced effects on NSPC intrinsic properties
include activation of the DNA damage response (DDR)
due to the formation of DNA adducts, induced by single
and double strand breaks, initially characterised by an
increase in phosphorylated γH2AX, which may lead to cell
cycle arrest through activation of cell cycle checkpoints
kinases and ultimately apoptosis [25, 26].
Lately, increased awareness of the importance
of hippocampal neurogenesis for memory function has
prompted the development of pharmacological strategies
aimed to protect this region during radiotherapy [27].
Nevertheless the radiosensitivity of NSPCs, even to low
doses of radiation, still represents a major clinical concern
and a suitable protective intervention is needed in order
to prevent the neurocognitive alterations observed after
radiotherapy [25, 28, 29].
Lithium is considered a promising drug in the
treatment of radiotherapy-induced neurocognitive decline,
as both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that lithium
has great potential for rescuing neurogenesis in the adult
and juvenile brain after irradiation [30–34]. In addition,
in vitro studies have proved lithium to be a specific radiosensitiser for tumour cells [35] while rescuing adult neural
stem and neuronal cell lines after irradiation, thereby
increasing the therapeutic window such that it can be used
in combination with radiotherapy [31, 34].
To our knowledge, the effects of lithium pretreatment on hippocampal NSPCs from the juvenile brain
in the context of irradiation have yet to be thoroughly
examined and in this study we report our novel findings
that lithium rescued ex vivo proliferation and cell
cycle arrest of irradiated young hippocampal NSPCs.
In agreement with previous studies, we found that
lithium, applied as a pre-treatment and maintained after
irradiation, moderately decreased DNA damage (γH2AX)
and recruited a significant proportion of NSPCs into

proliferation [31]. However, in contrast to previous reports
we did not find any evidence of lithium preventing young
NSPCs from irradiation-induced apoptosis, as judged by
annexin V and Sub-G1 cell cycle analysis [34, 36].

RESULTS
Lithium has a concentration-dependent effect on
NSPC proliferation
To investigate the effect of lithium on young NSPC
proliferation, we used an in vitro neurosphere assay, which
is a useful tool to investigate proliferation under diverse
conditions and it is a valuable in vitro model system to
study neurogenesis and neural development [37]. The
isolated young NSPCs were grown in stem cell culture
medium for 4 days until an average neurosphere diameter
of 100 μm was reached.
Lithium chloride (LiCl) was added postdissociation to a single cell suspension and maintained
until the analysis was performed, at 12, 24, 48, 72 and
96 hours. The neurosphere formation capacity reflects the
proliferative potential and/or cell death of this cell type
in vitro [38]. Therefore, we quantified the sphere volume
at 2 time points, 24 and 48 hours (Fig. 1A), and we found
that LiCl increased the volume of the clusters of dividing
cells formed into neurospheres in a concentration- and
time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B). Control neurospheres
had a mean volume (in μm3) of ≈  0.49 × 106, whereas
neurospheres treated with LiCl had a mean volume of
≈ 0.85 × 106 for 1 mM and ≈ 1.8 × 106 for 3 mM LiCl
after 24 hours exposure. After 48 hours we observed a
similar response, with controls having a mean volume of
≈ 3.4  × 106, whereas for 1 mM and 3 mM LiCl it was
≈ 4.9 × 106 and ≈ 11 × 106, respectively.
To confirm that this increase in neurosphere growth
was due to LiCl acting on proliferation, we investigated
the cell cycle distribution of the NSPCs using propidium
iodide (PI) as a DNA label and performed univariate
analysis of the DNA content in control, 1 mM and 3 mM
LiCl-treated samples. (Fig. 1C). We found that lithium
(3 mM) recruits up to 23% more cells to the S phase
(Fig. 1E) already after 24 hours exposure, at the expense
of a modest, 12%, reduction in the number of G1 phase
cells (Fig. 1D), and a consequent increase of 19% in
G2   phase cells (Fig. 1F) at 48 hours.

Lithium protects young NSPCs from irradiation
To study the effect of different doses of LiCl after
irradiation of NSPCs in vitro we used the neurosphere
model and exposed a single cell suspension to a moderate
irradiation dose of 3.5 Gy, as previously described [39].
NSPCs were pre-treated with 1 or 3 mM LiCl 12 hours
prior to irradiation, maintained in LiCl-containing medium

and assessed for neurosphere volume (Fig. 2A) at 24 and
48 hours after irradiation. This assay revealed that 3 mM
lithium restored, earliest detectable at 24 hours, the growth
capacity halted by irradiation (Fig. 2B). The 3.5 Gy
irradiation dose caused a drastic reduction in growth
that persisted even at the latest time point (72 h after
irradiation). The mean sphere volume (in μm3) at 24 hours
was ≈ 5.1 × 106 in sham-irradiated NSPCs, whereas in
irradiated NSPCs it was ≈ 1 × 106. In the 3 mM lithiumtreated, irradiated group the mean sphere volume was
more than twice as big, ≈ 2.6 × 106. Using 1 mM LiCl,
however, we only observed a slight but not significant
increase (≈1.3 × 106). A similar scenario was observed
48 hours after irradiation (Fig. 2B), where we found
that the mean sphere volume in sham-irradiated NSPCs
was ≈ 5.5 × 106 compared to ≈ 0.73 × 106 in irradiated,
≈2.8 × 106 in the 3 mM group and ≈ 1.4 × 106 in the 1 mM
group. To confirm the lithium effect on DNA synthesis
(S phase), we pulse-labelled the cells with BrdU for
120 minutes, 48 hours after radiation exposure, with
or without 3 mM LiCl. The BrdU incorporation assay
(Fig. 2C) revealed that NSPC proliferation was increased
by LiCl to a higher extent in the irradiated cells. BrdU
incorporation was increased 2.6-fold in non-irradiated and
16-fold in irradiated NSPCs (Fig. 2C).

treatment reduced the extent of irradiation-induced cell
death. We observed a time-dependent increase in cell
death due to irradiation up to 72 hours.
A similar effect was observed when analysing the
sub-G1 fraction on the PI histogram (Supplementary
Fig. 3D). This is a valid method to quantify cell death
[40] and revealed a higher percentage of cellular debris
24 hours after irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 2D and
Fig. 4D). However, lithium could not reduce or halt the
committed cell death in our neurosphere model.

LiCl reduced DNA damage after irradiation
To investigate if lithium protected NSPCs from
DNA damage induced by radiation, we quantified the
levels of the DNA damage response marker γH2AX
(Fig. 5A and 5B) 30 minutes after irradiation. Indeed,
the normalised values showed that lithium reduced the
radiation-induced DNA damage detected 30 minutes
after irradiation. We found a 2.26-fold increase in
phosphorylated γH2AX 30 minutes after irradiation
whereas NSPCs treated with 3 mM LiCl displayed a
1.98-fold increase (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, this suggests
that lithium maintains proliferation in NSPCs at least in
part by attenuating DNA damage response.

Lithium recruits NSPCs into proliferation after
irradiation-induced G1 arrest

DISCUSSION

To investigate the effect of LiCl on the cell cycle
distribution of NSPCs after irradiation we performed
cell cycle profile analysis. This analysis revealed that
irradiation induced cell cycle arrest in G1, which is the
cell cycle phase where most NSPCs were found following
irradiation. Lithium at 1 mM had a mild effect in reducing
this arrest in G1 at 24 and 72 hours (Supplementary
Fig. 2B) but it did not influence the number of cells in
S phase after irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 2C), and
caused a prominent secondary arrest in the G2 phase
24 to 72 hours post-irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 2D).
A similar scenario was observed for the higher dose of
3 mM at all time points from 6 to 72 hours after irradiation;
however, we found that the G1-S phase transition was
favoured, with a lower proportion of cells retained in G1
phase (Fig. 3B) and consequently higher numbers of cells
in S (Fig. 3C) and G2/M phases (Fig. 3D) when compared
to the irradiated non-treated group.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects
of different concentrations of LiCl on hippocampal NSPCs
from the young, developing brain after irradiation in vitro
in order to predict the response in vivo. Two relevant
concentrations were chosen based on previous findings,
including our own (Zanni et al., unpublished), showing
that lithium at therapeutic doses (0.6–1.2 mmol/L)
appears to accumulate in brain structures containing
a higher proportion of cell bodies in general and in
neurogenic regions in particular, suggesting that the brain
concentrations may not reflect those in the blood [41, 42].
Lithium is the most potent mood stabiliser used
in the treatment of bipolar disorders and it has proved
to be useful also for several other diseases. Pre-clinical
studies demonstrated that chronic lithium treatment
protects against the neurodegenerative effects of
cranial radiotherapy through its pro-neurogenic, antiinflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects [30, 34].
Beneficial effects on rescued neurogenesis and synaptic
plasticity in a Down syndrome mouse model have also
been investigated [43] as well as other pre-clinical studies
demonstrating the efficacy of lithium in preventing
neural degeneration and restoring synaptic networks in
diseases like Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease
and Fragile X syndrome [44, 45, 46]. There are as of
yet limited published clinical data to support lithium as

Lithium did not reduce apoptosis of NSPCs after
irradiation in vitro
To examine whether LiCl also had an antiapoptotic effect on NSPCs, annexin V and sub-G1
analyses were performed (Figs. 3A, 4A and 4B).
The annexin V analysis showed that neither 1 mM

a neuroprotective or neuroregenerative agent. Hopes
currently rest on future evidence to support the clinical use
of lithium for the prevention of neurocognitive sequelae
caused by cranial radiation therapy in children. The
outcomes of current clinical trials in adults [47, 48,  49]
will be valuable in the planning and safety assessment of
paediatric trials. Valid concerns have been raised about
lithium protecting not only neurons and neural stem cells,
but also remaining tumour cells and thereby promote
relapses [50, 51], even though these and other studies

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrate that lithium does not promote tumour growth
[34, 35, 50, 52]. Hence it is important to generate evidence
supporting the applicability of lithium in childhood cancer
patients.
As was previously described for adult hippocampal
NSPCs, young NSPCs respond to lithium with increased
proliferation and neurosphere formation in vitro in a
concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 1A and 1B) [32, 34].
Wexler et al. found that lithium acts on proliferation of
adult hippocampal progenitor cells via inhibition of

glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3-β), thereby
promoting DNA synthesis and proliferation through
activation of the downstream Wnt-βcatenin signalling,
and lithium in the range of 1–3 mM promoted neuronal
differentiation [32]. We also tested the differentiation
capacity of these cells and confirmed that lithium did not
affect the lineage commitment of NSPCs (Supplementary
Fig. 1A–1C). Additional previous studies observed that
this increase in proliferative capacity of young NSPCs
involved cell cycle entry and progress [52–56]. Higher

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proliferative potential of NSPCs seems to be correlated
to shortening of the cell cycle [57–59] and indeed in the
current study we found that the concentration-dependent
effect involved re-distribution of NSPCs across the cell
cycle. Accordingly, the percentage of cells in G1 phase
was reduced (Fig. 1D) in favour of a marked increase in
the S (Fig. 1E) and G2/M (Fig. 1F) phases. Taken together
our findings from the cell cycle distribution suggest that
lithium-treated NSPCs shortened the G1/S phase transition
or the time in G1, resulting in increased proliferation

as judged by both increased neurosphere growth and
increased BrdU incorporation (Fig. 2C).
Next we investigated whether this lithiumdependent proliferative gain could rescue young NSPCs
after irradiation, or rather promote radio-sensitization and
apoptosis, as previously observed in cancer cell lines [35].
To address this question we exposed NSPCs to 3.5 Gy
irradiation [60], resulting in a 5.3- and 7.5-fold decrease in
neurosphere volume compared to sham at 24 and 48 hours
after irradiation, respectively. The NSPCs receiving
12 hours lithium pre-treatment with 3 mM, but not 1 mM,
displayed a 2-fold increase in neurosphere volume both
24 and 48 hours after irradiation (Fig. 2B). These data
support previous studies where lithium was found to
increase neurosphere growth in vitro, hence ruling out the
possibility that this treatment may be sensitizing NSPCs
in the developing brain to irradiation [36, 61]. Lithium

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has previously been observed to radio-sensitize cancerous
cells and at the same time protect NSPCs, possibly due
to lithium acting on genes with multifunctional roles
in distinct DNA repair pathways, which are frequently
aberrant in cancer [35, 62]. This doubly beneficial effect
of lithium strongly argues in favour of concurrent lithium
treatment during radiotherapy [31, 35, 62].
To further validate that the increased size of the
irradiated neurospheres after lithium treatment was due
to increased numbers of proliferating cells, rather than
hypertrophy, we assessed BrdU incorporation in NSPCs
48 hours after irradiation (Fig. 2C), confirming that 3 mM
LiCl recruits NSPCs into proliferation and restores the
proliferative capacity halted after irradiation, as indicated
by increased DNA synthesis also in vivo [30, 63]. In
support of this, the cell cycle distribution of NSPCs after
irradiation revealed that the reduction of NSPCs in S phase

37090

could be rescued by 3 mM, but not 1 mM, LiCl treatment,
with full restoration of proliferation as early as 6 hours
after irradiation, and maintained protection at least up to
72 h after irradiation (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. 2C).
For regenerative purposes, manipulation of the
cell cycle in proliferating cells seems to be a promising
approach to therapy, and this is particularly relevant after
irradiation in an attempt to restore the depleted pool
of proliferating NSPCs [24, 58]. The DDR pathway is
activated in response to irradiation-induced DNA damage,
resulting in a cascade of events that ultimately promotes
post-translational modification of proteins involved in DNA
damage repair, modulation of apoptosis and/or cell cycle
progression [26, 28]. In particular, actively proliferating
cells make use of the cell cycle checkpoints to ensure there
is enough time for repair to occur, guaranteeing faithful
transmission of the genome to the daughter cells even after
genotoxic stress [28]. It was previously observed that an
arrest in the G1 phase following irradiation was related
to the activation of p53, a tumour suppressor gene that
in turn up-regulates p21 and p16Ink4a, cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors, thus leading to cell cycle arrest [64–
66]. Our cell cycle analysis revealed a 20% increase in
G1 arrest of NSPCs 24 hours after irradiation, persisting
for at least 72 hours, thus indicating that NSPCs respond
to irradiation by halting the cell cycle progression, most
likely in a p53-dependent manner [67, 68]. Interestingly,
our results showed that lithium has a concentrationdependent ameliorating effect on the G1 arrest after
irradiation, lasting at least up to 72 hours after irradiation
(Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 2B). Another interesting
observation following cell cycle distribution analysis was
the accumulation of NSPCs in G2 phase after irradiation at
all time points post irradiation. This accumulation was even
more prominent in lithium-pretreated irradiated NSPCs
(Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. 2D). Our hypothesis is
that at the time of irradiation there is a heterogeneous pool
of NSPCs, with cells at different cell cycle stages, which
activate different DDR signalling pathways. We propose
that cells that have recently entered interphase are more
likely to activate a p21-dependent G1 arrest, whereas
the cells that were recruited into proliferation by lithium
treatment and have initiated the elongation process, are
instead prone to arrest in G2 phase [28, 69].
To gain further insight into the mechanism of
action of lithium we tested the hypothesis that a higher
proliferative capacity may be concurrent with a higher
apoptotic rate as a form of homeostatic mechanism of selfrenewal, as observed in vivo in the DG of the mouse brain
[70, 71]. We investigated two parameters indicative of
apoptosis/cell death: annexin V (Fig. 4A and 4B), which
binds to the phosphatidyl serine (PS) expressed in early
apoptotic cells, and the sub-G1 cell cycle fraction (Fig. 3A
and Supplementary Fig. 2A), which reflects the population

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of dying cells with fragmented DNA [40, 72]. Our results
revealed that irradiated NSPCs display, from 24 hours
after irradiation onwards, a higher and sustained apoptotic
rate, as judged by both annexin V and sub-G1 analysis at
all time points analysed, and this increase in apoptosis
was not reversed by lithium, neither in the irradiated
nor in the sham NSPCs (Fig. 4C, 4D, Supplementary
Fig. 3C and 3D). These results do not corroborate previous
reports of lithium showing an anti-apoptotic effect after
radiation injury [30, 34]. This discrepancy might stem
from the fact that the study of Huo et al. was performed in
vivo and the microenvironment as well as the vasculature
play a pivotal role in modulating the apoptotic response
of NSPCs to ionising radiation [73]; whereas in the
study by Yazlovitskaya et al. they used the immortalised
HT22 adult hippocampal cell line, which may display a
different age-dependent radiosensitivity and different cellautonomous factors compared to our in vitro neurosphere
model of young primary NSPCs [8]. We propose that
young NSPCs suffering DNA damage, which are generally
driven into apoptosis [74], in the presence of lithium
remain committed to their programmed cell death to the
same extent as their untreated counterparts, and therefore
our conclusion is that lithium prevents the potentially
carcinogenic transmission of damaged NSPCs bearing
accumulated genotoxic stress through cell division.
As others and we have demonstrated that LiCl has a
pro-proliferative effect, it may be argued that the apparent
protection is merely a result of increased numbers of
unaffected NSPCs rather than a specific protection against
the effect of radiation. To further dissect the mechanisms
of lithium-mediated neuroprotection after irradiation
we sought to address the effect of LiCl on the DNA
damage response of NSPCs after irradiation. Protection
mechanisms include activation of the DNA-dependent
protein kinase (DNA-PK) that in turn modulates the
pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway causing a decrease in
γH2AX foci and an increase of the non-homologous
end joining repair (NHEJ) pathway [31, 34, 75, 76]. In
line with this, we found a reduction in radiation-induced
γH2AX activation in 3 mM LiCl-treated NSPCs (Fig. 5C),
indicating that this concentration of lithium was sufficient
to produce a significant, although modest, decrease in the
irradiation-induced DNA damage response, providing
supporting evidence that the lithium mediated-rescue
in proliferation of NSPCs is also accompanied by less
genotoxic stress response and possibly a higher degree of
protection.
In summary, the results from our in vitro model of
hippocampal neurogenesis in the juvenile brain showed
that NSPCs are protected by lithium, as reflected by higher
proliferation rates without a reduction in apoptosis. The
increase in proliferation is due to a shortening of the
cell cycle, as shown by increased percentage of cells in

S phase, and is accompanied by a reduction in irradiationinduced DNA damage. These findings strongly encourage
future clinical studies of lithium in young patients
receiving cranial radiotherapy.

converted into retinoic acid, which causes the NSPCs to
differentiate [79, 80], and our purpose was to keep the
NSPCs in their most undifferentiated state.
Viable cells were counted using a Burker chamber
and seeded at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/5 mL of
culture medium in a T25 flask. A proliferating state was
maintained by addition of fibroblast growth factor 2
(FGF-2, 20 ng/ml, PeproTech, United States of America),
epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 ng/ml, Gibco, United
States of America) and heparin (10 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich,
United Kingdom).
Every 4th day, when the neurospheres reached
an inhibiting size, they were passaged. The inhibiting
density is reached when the diameter of the neurospheres
is nearly 100 μm [81] and the centre of the sphere
displays a dark core. These features were analysed under
a brightfield microscope (Nikon TMS-F). For passaging,
cells were collected by centrifugation and a single cell
suspension was obtained by mechanical disruption of
the spheres using a 1000-μl pipette as well as addition
of 500 μl of TrypLE (trypsin, Gibco/Invitrogen, United
Kingdom). PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS w/o Ca2+
and Mg2+, Gibco/Invitrogen, United Kingdom) was used
to rinse the cells after trypsin treatment. Cells were fed
growth factors every 2nd day and cultured at 37°C in 5%
CO2 and 95% air with 100% humidity. The analysis was
performed after four passages to allow for a homogeneous
selection of the neural stem cell population, thus keeping
the genetic background of origin, avoiding chromosomal
aberration [82, 83].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and ethical permission
For all in vitro experiments hippocampal NSPCs
were prepared from postnatal day 8 female C57BL/6J
mice obtained from Charles Rivers Laboratories (Sulzfeld,
Germany). Animals were delivered with their respective
dams, housed under standard conditions of daylight
(12-hour light cycle) and provided food and water
ad libitum at the animal facility in Gothenburg (Laboratory
of Experimental Biomedicine, EBM). All experimental
conditions were approved by the Gothenburg Animal
Research Ethics Committee, in accordance with the
national animal welfare legislation. The following ethical
identification number was used: 20-2013.

Neural stem cell isolation and culture
Postnatal day 8 C57BL/6J mice were used for all
in vitro experiments. The dams were euthanised after the
pups were sacrificed. Each litter accounts for n = 1 and
each time point has an n of 3 or 6.
Mice were decapitated without prior exposure
to anaesthesia. Decapitation without anaesthesia is
particularly rapid in these very young mice and minimises
post-mortem changes in neural tissues [77]. Euthanasia
solely by decapitation is considered an acceptable and
preferable method for mouse pups [78].
The brains were rapidly removed and kept in
HibernateA solution (Gibco/Invitrogen, United Kingdom).
The hippocampi from each litter (12 hippocampi in each
group) were pooled in the same tube and stored in ice cold
HibernateA (Gibco/Invitrogen, United Kingdom).
The tissue was chopped and digested for
a total of 20 minutes at 37°C in 0.01% papain
(Worthington/Cell Systems, United States), 0.1%
Dispase II (Roche, Indianapolis, United States), 0.01%
DNAse I (Worthington/Cell Systems, United States),
12.4 mM MgSO4 in HBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+
(Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution, Worthington/Cell
Systems, United States). The homogenate was spun
down at 500 × g for 5 minutes and re-suspended in 1
ml new medium consisting of NeurobasalA (Gibco/
Invitrogen, United Kingdom) with addition of 1X
Glutamax (Gibco/Invitrogen, United Kingdom), 1X
B27 without vitamin A (B27 w/o vitamin A, Gibco/
Invitrogen, United Kingdom), penicillin (100 U/mL,
Gibco/Invitrogen, United Kingdom) and streptomycin
(100 μg/mL, Gibco/Invitrogen, United Kingdom). Here
we used B27 w/o vitamin A, because the latter can be

In vitro lithium administration
Lithium chloride, LiCl (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis,
USA), was added to the single cell suspension at the 4th
passage at 2 different concentrations: 1 mM or 3 mM
[32]. Analyses were performed at 12, 24, 48, 72 and
96 hours after the last passage. Between the last passage
and analysis the cells were kept under proliferating
conditions, as mentioned above, and fed 48 hours after the
last passage. For the irradiation experiments, cells were
pre-treated 12 hours prior to irradiation with 1 or 3 mM
LiCl after the last passage and the analysis was performed
6, 24, 48 or 72 hours after irradiation.

In vitro irradiation
A photon 60Co irradiation source (TEM Mobaltron
Therapy Unit, Crawley, UK) was used to expose the
NSPCs in single cell suspension at a set distance of 0.8 m
and an absorbed dose of 3.5 Gy. Cells were irradiated
at 1.3 × 106 cells/ml density at 37°C for cell cycle and
annexin V analysis, whereas for γH2AX cells were kept
at 2°C to prevent DNA repair during the irradiation
procedure. After irradiation, cells were placed back in their
37092

Oncotarget

GmbH, Martinsried, Germany). Representative pictures
for each n were taken in 4 consistent regions of each
well using a Leica DFC 295 camera and a Nikon TMS-F
light microscope. For the irradiation experiment a Nikon
ECLIPSE TE20 microscope with an INFINITY1–2C
camera and Infinite analyze software were used to capture
the pictures.
The diameter of each sphere was measured and
the corresponding volume (in μm3) of the sphere was
calculated offline for the 24 and 48 hour time using Image
J 1.45s (Wayne Rasband, NIH, USA).

respective culture medium and kept in the incubator until
flow cytometry analysis was performed.

Cell cycle, annexin V and γH2AX flow cytometry
analysis
At the time of analysis a single cell suspension was
obtained as described above, except for replacing TryplE
with 0.02% EDTA (Titriplex® III. Z.A, E. Merck D-6100,
Darmstadt). EDTA was used to preserve cell viability and
to avoid annexin V leakage over the cell membrane due to
trypsin treatment. For the entire analysis cell suspensions
were triturated through a syringe and filtered through a
nylon filter (pore size 41 μm, Millipore) to dispose of
possible aggregates.
The propidium iodide (PI) staining solution
consisted of 50 μg/ml PI (Molecular Probes®, Eugene,
Oregon, United States), 0.1 mg/ml RNase A (Pure
link™ Invitrogen, United States) and 0.6% Tergitol-type
NP-40 (Sigma Aldrich, United Kingdom). DNA content
frequency histogram was obtained using CellQuest Pro™
software (BD Biosciences, Stockholm, Sweden), where
cell counting was plotted on the y-axis and PI fluorescence
pulse area (FL2-A) on the x-axis. Univariate analysis was
performed using ModFit LT V 3.0 (Verity Software house,
Inc. Topsham, ME, USA).
Quantification of apoptosis was performed using
the Alexa Fluor® 488 AnnexinV cell apoptosis kit
(Molecular Probes®) as per manufacturer’s instructions at
a concentration of 0.2 μg/ 1 × 106 cells/ml. We did not use
concomitant labelling of annexin V with PI because laser
compensation was not possible for this cell type, resulting
in all events being consistently double-positive for both
markers.
Quantification of DNA double strand break repair
was detected 30 minutes after radiation by washing
the cells in PBS and putting them in blocking buffer
containing FITC-conjugated anti-γH2AX antibody (#16–
202A, Millipore, Billerica, USA) for 3 hours and washed
again in PBS prior to flow cytometry analysis.
For both annexin V and γH2AX the signal intensity
of irradiated samples was correlated to the signal from
non-irradiated cells for each condition and repair time as
previously reported [84].
PI, annexin V and γH2AX analyses were performed
using a flow cytometer (BD FACS Calibur ™) with a
488 nm argon laser.
NSPCs were detected by granularity and cell size by
using side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) of the
flow cytometer.

Proliferation assay
Proliferation was evaluated using a 5′-Bromo2′Deoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation kit (Roche,
Manheim, Germany). After irradiation cells were kept
in T75 flasks in culture medium, with growth factors,
for 48  hours. Cells were pulse-labelled with 10 μM
BrdU for 120 minutes and then plated in a flat-bottom
96-well culture plate coated with poly-L-ornithine/
laminin at a density of 5 × 103. Cells were allowed to
attach for 24 hours and the assay was then performed as
recommended by the manufacturer.

Differentiation
Differentiation of NSPCs was performed to
demonstrate that they were multipotent and to investigate
if lithium had any effect on lineage commitment. At the
5th passage they were plated as single cell in 19 mm
Ø glasses, coated with 100 μg/ml polyornithine (SigmaAldrich, Stockholm, Sweden) and 50 μg/ml laminin
(Gibco/Invitrogen, United Kingdom) in a 12-well plate.
In each well the seeding density was 6 × 104 NSPCs in
2 ml medium. The differentiation assay consisted of a
gradual withdrawal of the growth factors in order to
minimise cell death. The first 2 days the NSPCs received
10 ng/ml EGF and 10 ng/ml FGF, followed by 1 day
of 5 ng/ml FGF and 4 days of complete withdrawal.
Every second day half the medium was replaced. After
7 days in culture, the medium was removed, the cells
were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
PFA (Merck-VWR, Stockholm, Sweden) for 20 minutes
at 4°C. Cells were washed twice in PBS for 10 minutes
and put in blocking solution (0.2% Triton X-100, 5%
donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories
Inc., Cambridgeshire, UK), PBS) for 1 hour at room
temperature on a shaking plate. Primary antibodies were
incubated for 24 hours at 4°C on a shaking plate, and
secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature
on a shaking plate. Both steps were performed in the
blocking solution mentioned above. Between primary
and secondary antibodies, cells were washed twice in
PBS for 10 minutes. The following primary antibodies
were used separately: mouse polyclonal anti-GFAP

Sphere size quantification (proliferation assay)
After the last 4th passage single cells were plated at a
density of 3 × 104 cells/ml or after irradiation at a density
of 5 × 104 cells/ml in an uncoated μ-Slide 8 well (iBidi,

(1:500 Merck Millipore, Billerica, USA) and mouse
monoclonal anti-MAP2 (2a-2b) (1:500 Sigma- Aldrich,
Saint Louis, Missouri, USA). All secondary antibodies
were used at 1:1,000 dilution and the following
antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor® 488 and 555 Donkey
anti-mouse IgG (H+L). Cells were coverslipped  with
ProLong Gold containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) for nuclear
counter staining. Cells were counted as a percentage of
positive cells for each lineage marker over the number
of DAPI-positive cells using a semiautomatic stereology
system (Stereo Investigator, MicroBrightField Inc;
Colchester, VT, USA) under fluorescent light.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad

mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical
differences presented here were calculated using either a
2-way ANOVA when 2 treatments, irradiation and lithium,
were compared or a one-way ANOVA for one treatment,
only lithium, comparison. These tests of variances were
followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test for multiple
comparison correction. A two-tailed unpaired t-test was
used for the lineage commitment analysis. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
