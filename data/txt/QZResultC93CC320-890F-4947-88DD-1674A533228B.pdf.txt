ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor in adults and remains
incurable despite multimodal intensive treatment regimens. The majority of GBM
tumors show a mutated or overexpressed EGFR, however, tumors treated with
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) will inevitably recur highlighting the need to identify
signalling pathways involved in GBM resistance to these drugs. To this end, we treated
GBM cells that overexpress EGFR with increasing concentrations of gefitinib and
isolated resistant clones. These resistant clones were subject to RNAseq and the
expression of several genes was found to be upregulated. These genes are mainly
tyrosine kinase receptors and include ROS1, DDR1 and PDGFRA and are known to
control several downstream targets of EGFR. The upregulation of ROS1 and DDR1 was
confirmed at the protein level by western blot. Treatment with a potent and highly
specific pyrazole ROS1 inhibitor in ROS1 overexpressing clones led to a sensitization
of these cells to low concentrations of gefitinib. Combined treatment with gefitinib
and ROS1 inhibitor induces massive cell death by apoptosis following a prolonged S
phase cell cycle arrest. Our current study led to the discovery of alternative pathways
used by GBM cells to evade cell death following treatment with gefitinib and identifies
new therapeutic targets to prevent GBM cell resistance to the drug.

INTRODUCTION

kinase (TK) domain [5]. Binding of a cognate ligand to
the ligand-binding site results in the autophosphorylation
of the receptor and induction of downstream signaling
through the PI3K/Akt and the MAPK pathways, among
others [4] leading to cell differentiation, proliferation, and
survival [6].
EGFR amplification and mutations are also found
in breast, lung, and prostate cancers [7]. In spite of this,
therapies that have been effective for these solid tumors
have shown limited efficacy against GBM. EGFR-specific
inhibitors have been approved for use in patients with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and are currently
in clinical trials for GBM [8-10]. However, the clinical
experience has been that many GBM patients do not
respond to these therapies and those that do eventually

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common
primary malignant brain tumor in adults [1, 2]. Despite
multimodal therapy with radiation and the alkylating agent
temozolomide, median survival is a dismal 15 months
[3]. The most common genetic aberration associated
with GBM is amplification of the epidermal growth
factor receptor gene (EGFR, also referred to as ERBB1
or HER1), with a frequency of about 50% [1]. EGFR is
a member of the HER superfamily of receptor tyrosine
kinases, together with ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4
[4]. The structure of each of the members comprises: a
ligand-binding ectodomain with 2 cysteine-rich regions; a
single transmembrane region; and a cytoplasmic tyrosine

show progression [11]. Successful treatment of GBM
continues to be a major therapeutic challenge due to both
inherent and acquired resistance [12, 13]. Mechanisms
causing resistance to EGFR inhibitors have been studied
in a number of solid tumors. Some of the documented
mechanisms include the acquisition of secondary EGFR
point mutations, co-activation and/or amplification of
other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and up-regulation
of drug efflux pumps, however, mechanisms of resistance
that are unique to glioma are not clearly defined [12, 13].
Specific drugs that target EGFR signaling include
erlotinib and gefitinib, which reversibly inhibit the EGFR
tyrosine kinase domain by competitively binding with
ATP, and the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cetuximab (a
chimeric mouse-human IgG1 antibody) and panitumumab
(a fully humanized IgG2 antibody). Cetuximab and
panitumumab block ligand binding to the extracellular
domain of EGFR, promote receptor internalization and
mediate antibody- and complement-mediated cytotoxicity
[14]. The common EGFR-activating mutations, exon 19
deletions and L858R, which account for 85% of all EGFR
mutations, predict sensitivity to the EGFR TKIs (gefitinib,
erlotinib and afatinib) in preclinical models and in patients
with lung cancer. However, these mutations are largely
absent in brain tumors.
To determine the mechanism by which glioblastoma
cells acquire resistance to RTK inhibitors, U87 cells
overexpressing EGFR were treated with increasing
concentrations of gefitinib and resistant clones were
isolated, expanded and subject to RNA sequencing
(RNAseq). Data analysis revealed that the resistant clones
show overexpression of the orphan RTK c-ros oncogene
1 (ROS1), discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1
(DDR1) or the platelet-derived growth factor receptor,
alpha (PDGFRA). Other proteins from the AKT/mTOR
pathway were also mildly amplified. Overexpression of
ROS1 and DDR1 proteins was confirmed by western
blotting. Using a pyrazole ROS1 inhibitor in four of the
resistant clones, we were able to sensitize them to gefitinib
confirming that the resistance was mediated by ROS1 in
these cells. We also showed that both gefitinib and ROS1
inhibitors induce cell death by apoptosis following an S
phase cell cycle arrest.

curve assay showed that the gefitinib IC50 concentration
for U87-EGFR is 0.75 µM. We therefore started the screen
at 0.75 µM and gradually escalated the dose up to 3.25
µM over a period of eight weeks. Cells that survived at
this concentration were expanded, pooled together, and
subject to RNA-seq. Non treated U87-EGFR gefitinibsensitive cells were used as controls. The study design
is described in Figure 1A. Three plates from either non
treated or treated cells were used for RNA extraction and
RNA sequencing. RNA-seq results show that besides a
statistically significant increase in AKT1, AKT2, AKT3,
PDGFB, LAMTOR1, LAMTOR2, LAMTOR3 and FIGF
(Figure 1B), three tyrosine kinase receptor genes ROS1,
DDR1 and PRGFRA showed the most significant increase
in the gefitinib resistant cells. Figure 1B-1D shows a 12
times increase in ROS1 transcript in gefitinib-resistant
cells compared to non-treated cells. Similarly, DDR1
transcript levels were much higher in the gefitinib-resistant
cells compared to the sensitive ones (Figure 1D). This
increase was not specific to U87-EGFR cells and was also
observed in a low passage tumor-derived GBM cell line
(Figure S1). While PDGFRA overexpression has been
show to mediate resistance to EGFR inhibitors, to our
knowledge, this is the first report of the involvement of
ROS1 and DDR1 in TKI resistance in GBM. Interestingly,
a survey of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data
indicates that ROS1 and DDR1 upregulation correlates
with shorter overall survival (OS) and progression free
survival (PFS) (Figure S2).

The increase in ROS1 and DDR1 transcripts in
the resistant cells correlates with an increase in
protein expression
Oncogenic activation of ROS1 is observed in a
subset of patients with glioblastoma, non–small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), and cholangiocarcinoma [1517]. In most cases, ROS1 signaling is activated by
interchromosomal translocation or intrachromosomal
deletion that results in N-terminal ROS1 fusion genes.
Several ROS1 kinase fusion proteins have been identified,
including the Fused in Glioblastoma–ROS1 (FIG–ROS)
that was first discovered in a human glioblastoma cell
line [18] and more recently in patients with NSCLC [19],
cholangiocarcinoma [17], and serous ovarian carcinoma
[18]. The SLC34A2–ROS1 (SLC–ROS) fusion is present
in a subset of patients with NSCLC [13, 19] and gastric
cancer [20]. Other ROS1 fusions include CD74–ROS1,
EZR–ROS1, LRIG3–ROS1, SDC4–ROS1, and TPM3–
ROS1 [17]. To test whether the observed increase in
transcript levels of ROS1 and DDR1 translates to an
increase in protein level expression, lysates from gefitinibresistant and gefitinib-senstive cells were tested for ROS1
protein expression by western blotting. To this end, single
clones were derived from the original pool of resistant

cells. Single clones were expanded and tested by western
blotting for the expression of ROS1 protein. Four clones
showed overexpression of different ROS1 fusion proteins
(Figure 2A). Interestingly, one of the four clones (RC1)
shows both overexpression of ROS1 and its ligand VAV3
(Figure 2B), a Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange
factor, associated with tumor growth, apoptosis, invasion
and metastasis, and angiogenesis, which has also been
shown to be phosphorylated and activated by ROS1 [21].
The pooled resistant cells were also tested for DDR1
protein expression. DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase
that is identified during the search for tyrosine kinase
proteins expressed in human malignancies [22]. DDR1
kinase contains a homology domain to discoidin, which is
distinct from other members of the large receptor tyrosine
kinase and could be activated by various types of collagens
and is found to be involved in cell attachment, migration
and invasion [23]. Accumulated evidence indicates that
DDR1 is overexpressed in invasive tumors including
breast, prostate, lung and cancer cells overexpressing
DDR1 display increased migration and invasion [24, 25].

For instance, upregulated DDR1 expression promotes
cancer development by enhancing cancer cell survival and
invasion, and high DDR1 expression is associated with
short hormone resistance interval in prostate carcinoma
[26]. Figure 2C shows that while the sensitive cells
show an almost undetectable level of endogenous DDR1
protein, DDR1 protein is highly expressed in lysates from
the resistant cells. These data show that ROS1 and DDR1
are upregulated both at the RNA and protein levels and
may be responsible for resistance to gefitinib. Since ROS1
inhibitors are readily available, we decided to follow up on
the ROS1 overexpressing clones and test the possibility of
rendering them sensitive to low concentrations of gefitinib
using a pyrazole ROS1 inhibitor that we have previously
shown to specifically target ROS1 protein but not a
large panel of kinases including tyrosine kinase receptor
proteins.

Gefitinib-resistant cells that overexpress ROS1
protein are highly sensitive to ROS1 inhibitors

and showed a moderate effect compared to the pyrazole
ROS1 inhibitor (Figure S3). These data show that ROS1
inhibition provide a therapeutic alternative in gefitinibresistant cells that overexpress ROS1 fusions.

We have previously described a number of
pyrazole compounds that have a potent and selective
activity with IC50 value of 199 nM for ROS1 [27].
Recently, we synthesized a new pyrazole compound that
shows excellent inhibition of ROS1 enzymatic activity
with an IC50 value of 23.2 nM and it also showed high
selectivity for ROS1 kinase (Figure 3A) [28]. To test
whether gefitinib-resistant cells that overexpress ROS1
fusions can be sensitized with the ROS1 inhibitor to low
concentrations of gefitinib, the four clones that show
over-expression of the ROS1 fusions as well as gefitinibsensitive cells were subject to increasing concentrations
of the ROS1 inhibitor either singly or in combination with
1 µM gefitinib. Data in Figure 3B show that gefitinibresistant cells are sensitive to ROS1 inhibitor and a 2X
the IC50 of the drug (23.2 nM) combined with 1 µM of
gefitinib achieved an almost complete growth inhibition
of the resistant cells in 36 hours while ROS1 inhibitor
only did not show a dramatic effect on gefitinib-sensitive
cells. Crizotinib, a FDA approved drug for treatment of
Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) patients with
rearranged ROS1 was used to treat these resistant cells

ROS1 inhibition leads to S phase cell cycle arrest
followed by cell death in gefitinib-resistant cells
To investigate the mechanism by which ROS1
inhibitor induces cell death in gefitinib-resistant cells,
we analyzed the cell cycle profile of both gefitinibsensitive and gefitinib-resistant cells after treatment
with either gefitinib, ROS1 inhibitor or a combination of
both inhibitors (Figure 4A). While the non-treated cells
show a normal cell cycle distribution in both gefitinibsensitive and gefitinib-resistant cells, despite small
differences mainly in G2 and S phase populations, the cell
cycle profile of gefitinib-resistant cells did not show any
noticeable changes after treatment with 3 µM gefitinib,
however the gefitinib-sensitive cells showed an increase
in S phase population, a slight increase in G2 population
and the accumulation of a sub-G1 population, suggestive
of an active cell death likely by apoptosis. Treatment of
gefitinib-resistant cells with gefitinib only led to a slight
increase in S phase population. Treatment with pyrazole

ROS1 inhibitor led to a slight increase S phase cells and
the start of the appearance of a small sub-G1 population.
Such a sub-G1 population was completely absent in
the sensitive cells suggesting that sensitive cells do not
rely on ROS1 for their growth. Combination of gefitinib
and pyrazole ROS1 inhibitors led to a sharp S arrest,
an almost complete absence of mitotic cells, a sharp
decrease in G1 population and accumulation of cells in
sub-G1 in both resistant and sensitive cells. These data
indicate that ROS1 inhibition of cell growth in gefitinibresistant cells is mediated through a prolonged S phase
checkpoint arrest followed by accumulation of a sub-G1
population indicative of cell death by apoptosis. The
apoptotic phenotype is supported by an increase in PARP
cleavage in cells treated by the ROS1 inhibitor and ROS1
inhibitor combined with gefitinib (Figure 4B). Since ROS1
activates some of the same pathways that are activated
by EGFR, we investigated whether the ROS1 inhibitor
compound was able to inhibit the downstream EGFR
effectors mainly AKT1 and p42 MAPK proteins. Indeed,
while gefitinib alone was unable to inhibit the active forms
of these proteins in the resistant clones, ROS1 inhibitor
alone or in combination with gefitinib efficiently inhibited
the expression of both p-AKT1 and p-p42 MAPK (Figure
4C).

To further investigate the role of ROS1 overexpression in
gefitinib resistance, we used the pyrazole ROS1 inhibitor
that is very highly potent and specific and showed that
this inhibitor sensitizes gefitinib-resistant cells to the drug
at low concentrations. The mechanism by which ROS1
induces cell death in combination with gefitinib in both
resistant and sensitive cells is through a cell cycle arrest in
S phase and a subsequent cell death by apoptosis.
Given the recent success of molecularly targeted
therapies in treating cancers driven by oncogenic kinases,
there is acute clinical momentum to identify inhibitors
that selectively target ROS1 fusions. Because the ROS1
and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) domains are
partially homologous, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved ALK/MET kinase inhibitor crizotinib
is being investigated via phase I/II clinical trials for its
efficacy in ROS1-driven lung cancer patients [29]. The
ROS1 inhibitor described in this study showed a stronger
inhibitory effect on ROS1 rearrangements compared to
crizotinib. More recently, foretinib (GSK1363089) and
Gö6976 were also shown to be potent inhibitors of ROS1
[30]. Foretinib was shown to selectively suppress the
growth of ROS1 fusions-driven cell lines as well as of
FIG–ROS-driven tumors in mice [30].
These data indicate that a genetic screen of tumors
that develop resistance to TKI can reveal alternative
pathways that drive resistance to the drugs and these
pathways can be targeted to achieve cell death. Developing
inhibitors to the proteins identified during this study will
provide alternatives to patients with recurrent brain tumors
that are refractory to EGFR therapy.

DISCUSSION
Resistance to EGFR therapy is an endemic problem
faced in the clinic every day. While the majority of
brain tumors show an overexpressed or mutant EGFR,
TKI remain inefficient and even patients that show
some response eventually recur as a result of acquired
resistance. While in lung cancer, mutations that are
associated with TKI sensitivity are well established and
secondary mutations that lead to acquired resistance are
also well known, no such mutations have been reported in
brain tumors. To identify genetic determinants associated
with resistance to EGFR therapy, and specifically to
the TKI inhibitor, gefitinib, we carried out an RNA-seq
of gefitinib-resistant and gefitinib-sensitive clones and
identified three proteins that were highly expressed as
a result of the inhibition of the EGRF receptor namely
ROS1, DDR1 and PDGFRA. Of importance, all the three
proteins are tyrosine kinase receptors themselves and
regulate the same signaling pathways that are associated
with EGFR activation. While PDFRA upregulation has
been associated with TKI resistance, to our knowledge,
there are no reports of ROS1 and DDR1 involvement
in this process. We therefore followed up on DDR1 and
ROS1 and confirmed that these proteins were upregulated
at the protein level as well and not only at the RNA level.
Blotting for ROS 1 protein also showed that several fusion
proteins involving ROS1 were expressed. As indicated
earlier, ROS1 is activated as a fusion protein with several
proteins leading to a constitutively active chimeric protein.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation of gefitinib-resistant clones
To isolate gefitinib-resistant clones, U87 GBM cells
were transfected with a retroviral construct that expresses
EGFR. Stable clones were isolated by selection with
puromycin. EGFR Protein overexpression was confirmed
by western blot. To isolate gefitinib-resistant clones,
70-80% confluent cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of gefitinib starting from 0.75 µM/ml for 2
weeks. The remaining viable cells were then treated with
1 µM/ml of gefitinib, and repeated the procedures until we
reached 3 µM/ml. Cells that were able to resist a 3 µM/
ml were pooled together and used for RNA extraction and
RNA sequencing.

RNA Isolation and RNA sequencing
RNA was isolated from six different clones of U87
cells, three of which are resistant to 3 µM/ml of gefitinib
and three are sensitive. These cells were grown as
