Abstract
Uveal melanoma is highly metastatic, prognosis is poor and there are no effective
treatments to extend survival. Accumulating evidence suggests that thyroid hormones
have a mitogenic effect via binding to αvβ3 integrin. We aimed to examine the impact
of thyroid status on survival in a murine B16F10 model for ocular melanoma, highly
expressing the integrin. In two independent experiments oral propylthiouracil (PTU)
was used to induce hypothyroidism (n=9), thyroxine to induce hyperthyroidism
(n=11) and mice given plain water served as control (n=8). At day 21, the subretinal
space was inoculated with 102 B16F10 cells. In non-inoculated mice (n=6 of each
group) serum free T4 (FT4) levels were measured and additional non-inoculated
mice (3 given PTU and 4 given thyroxine or water) served as internal control to
demonstrate the impact of the dissolved substance. The PTU-inoculated mice showed
clinical evidence of intraocular tumor growth significantly later than the thyroxine
mice (P=0.003) and survival time was significantly longer (P<0.001). FT4 levels
differed significantly between groups (P<0.001) and with no signs of illness in the
internal control group. Our findings suggest that hyperthyroidism shortens survival,
whereas relative hypothyroidism may have a protective role in metastatic ocular
melanoma.

Introduction

4]. Metastatic UM has a poor prognosis, with a reported
median survival of 4-15 months [5]. Despite considerable
improvement in local treatments, especially that of eyepreserving radiotherapy, there has been no change in
survival rates in the past 4 decades [4, 6]. Taken together,
these poor outcomes emphasize the need for alternatives
to traditional treatments for UM.

Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary
intraocular malignancy in adults, and a condition that may
lead to fatal metastases [1, 2]. It is estimated that 50%
of UM patients may develop metastatic disease, with the
spread of tumor cells being predominantly to the liver [3,

For more than two decades, the actions of thyroid
hormones in a variety of tumor models have been
described to influence proliferation and angiogenesis in
breast, glial, thyroid and lung cancer cells [7]. In 2003,
the pharmacological induction of mild biochemical
hypothyroidism by means of propylthiouracil (PTU)
significantly improved survival duration in patients with
glioblastoma multiforme, one of the most aggressive
forms of brain tumors [8]. In addition, hypothyroidism
was found to increase response rates to chemotherapy and
radiation therapy in preclinical models and clinical studies
of various tumor types (reviewed in [9] and [10]). In
contrast, the hyperthyroid state was found to be associated
with increased cancer risk in a prospective population
study [11]. The possible clinical roles of thyroid hormone
in cancer behavior have recently been reviewed [12]. One
explanation for the possible association between thyroid
hormone levels and cancer was recently given in the form
of a receptor for L-thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3’-triiodo-Lthyronine (T3) on plasma membrane integrin αvβ3 [10,
13]. This integrin appears to mediate the proliferative
action of the hormone on blood vessel cells and on tumor
cells [10]
To the best of our knowledge, the influence of
thyroid hormone on UM has not been investigated to
date. We therefore determined the impact of thyroid status
on survival of C57BL/6 mice inoculated with B16F10
melanoma cells and confirmed that hyperthyroidism
shortened survival in metastatic ocular melanoma, while

hypothyroidism had a significant protective effect.

Results
For in vivo testing we used the mouse melanoma
B16F10 cell line, given its ability to form tumors when
injected into the anterior eye chamber of murine eyes[1417]. Of the 100,000 B16F10 melanoma cells that were
evaluated (Figure 1A), a high expression of αv (Figure
1B) and β3 monomers (Figure 1C) was documented.
All melanoma cells were positive for both αv and β3
monomers, thus demonstrating high expressions of the
αvβ3 dimer on the B16F10 cell membrane (Figure 1D).
These results indicated that B16F10 melanoma cells were
a valid platform to examine in vivo the effect of the thyroid
status via the αvβ3 integrin.
Figure 2 demonstrates the treatment schedules used
in this study, which consisted of two identical independent
experiments. A hypothyroid state was induced in 9 mice
by adding PTU to the drinking water and a hyperthyroid
state was induced in 11 mice by adding thyroxine to
drinking water. Eight additional mice were given plain
tap water and served as controls. Six mice of each group
before inoculation represented the thyroid status of their
specified group by means of measuring the serum free T4
levels (FT4). FT4 levels in the PTU hypothyroid group (7.7
± 0.4 pmol/L) and the thyroxine hyperthyroid group (43.7
± 1.8 pmol/L) were significantly different from those of

Figure 4 shows the differences in time from
inoculation to clinical evidence of intraocular tumor
growth (Figure 4A), tumor growth to death (Figure 4B)
and the survival time from the day of inoculation till death
(Figure 4C) of the different experimental groups. The PTU
group had a significantly longer inoculation-to-tumor time
(Figure 4A) than the control group (p = 0.019), whereas
there were no significant differences between the control
and thyroxine groups (p = 0.626). Of note, intraocular
tumors were diagnosed significantly earlier in the
thyroxine group compared to the PTU group (p = 0.003).
When assessing the tumor-to-death time (Figure
4B), the PTU group exhibited a significantly longer period
compared to the thyroxine group (p = 0.005). Interestingly,
no significant differences were observed between the PTU
and thyroxine groups compared to the control group (p ≥
0.094).

the controls (27.5 ± 2.3 pmol/L) (p<0.001).
After 21 days (Figure 2, experimental groups, day
0), the subretinal space of each mouse’s right eye was
inoculated with aliquots of 102 B16F10 cells/1 µL PBS
using a transconjunctival approach as previously described
[18]. There were no cases of cell reflux following tumor
inoculation and the subconjunctival space remained
free of tumor cells. As expected from preliminary
experiments (data not shown), tumors were evident
about two weeks from inoculation. Enucleated eyes and
dissected lungs of 2 mice from each experimental group
were sent for pathological processing and H&E and
S-100 staining. Macro metastasis of B16F10 cells (Figure
3A), surrounded by typical lung tissue, were identified
in the lung (Figure 3B). Positive S100 immunostaining
confirmed the presence of melanoma cells (Figure 3C).
Typical melanoma cells were also detected behind the
lens, between the pigment epithelium and retina (Figure

Figure 2: Treatment schedules for the study groups. Forty six mice were given propylthiouracil (PTU), thyroxine, both in drinking
water, or tap water (control) for 21 days. Six mice from each group were then removed in order to measure FT4 levels (Thyroid status),
after which they were sacrificed. Of the remaining 28 mice—9 given PTU, 11 given thyroxine and 8 given tap water (Experimental
groups)—were inoculated with tumor cells (day 0) and monitored daily, and first sign of intraocular tumor growth was recorded. The time
from inoculation to spontaneous death was defined as the survival time. The internal control consisted of 11 additional mice, 3 given PTU,
4 given thyroxine and 4 given tap water; they were not inoculated with tumor cells. These mice were followed-up and sacrificed 2 months
after the last experimental mouse had died (blood samples had been obtained for FT4 level determination beforehand).

Discussion

Finally, the average survival for all groups was 29.5
± 4.0 days (range: 23.0–39.0 days). There were significant
differences in survival between groups (Figures 4C and 5).
The PTU group survived significantly longer (33.8 ± 3.3
days, p = 0.001) than the control group (28.9 ± 1.9 days),
the latter representing the natural history of a melanomatumor bearing murine eye. The addition of thyroxine to
drinking water significantly shortened survival (26.5 ± 2.4
days, p = 0.029) compared to the controls.
An internal control group served to verify that the
inoculated mice died of the tumor and not as a result of
the thyroid status. This group was comprised of 3 PTU
mice and 4 mice each of the thyroxine and control groups
which were not inoculated with tumor cells. These
mice were followed daily for signs of illness, which
were not detected at any stage. Two months after the
last experimental mouse had spontaneously died blood
samples were obtained from the internal control group
mice for determining their FT4 levels, after which they
were sacrificed. The FT4 levels for the PTU, thyroxine and
control groups were 6.9 ± 0.2 pmol/L, 42.1 ± 3.4 pmol/L
and 23.4 ± 0.6 pmol/L (p < 0.001). As noted above, serum
FT4 values in the experimental groups were appropriately
different from measurements in the control animals.
Figure 6 depicts the proliferative action of T4 in vitro
on B16F10 melanoma cells and on a human melanoma
cell line, Malme-3M, thus indicating effects of thyroid
hormone in our in vivo studies are not limited to B16F10
cells. The total T4 concentration of 10-7 M achieves a
physiological FT4 level of <10-10 M in the culture medium
used [13]. Propylthioracil inhibits cell conversion of T4 to
T3 and did not inhibit the proliferative action of T4 on these
cell lines; thus, the proliferative response of the melanoma
cells to T4 in vitro reflects action of the latter as a hormone,
not as a prohormone source of T3.

The prognosis for patients with UM is poor and
the mortality rate remains high, due to development of
metastatic disease which is highly resistant to systemic
therapy. A recent and comprehensive review of the
systemic treatment of metastatic UM concluded that
the limited efficacy of current treatment approaches
underscores the medical need for more effective
treatment options [19]. Accumulating data suggest that
hyperthyroidism may increase the risk of certain nonocular solid tumors, whereas hypothyroidism may delay

Figure 6: Proliferative effects of T4 on mouse melanoma
(B16F10) and human melanoma (Malme-3M) cells in
vitro. In this set of representative PCNA immunoblots, T4 at

10-8 and 10-7 M is shown to stimulate tumor cell proliferation. At
10-7 M in the buffer system used, T4 generates a physiologic free
T4 concentration [13]. PTU treatment of cells did not affect the
proliferation action of T4 indicating that conversion of T4 to T3 is
not involved in this tumor cell effect of the hormone. Proliferative
actions of unmodified T4 are expressed via integrin αvβ3 [27,
28]. Independent experiments: B16F10 cells, n = 3; Malme-3M

onset and reduce aggressiveness of cancers [9, 12]. Based
on these data, we designed a set of experiments to examine
the impact of different levels of circulating FT4 on survival
duration in a UM murine model. The recent discovery of
a receptor on plasma membrane integrin αvβ3 which may
mediate the proliferative action of thyroid hormone on
tumor cells [10], motivated us to examine its expression
on B16F10 melanoma cells, which were chosen for
the present study. Our results documented, similarly
to previous reports [20] that these cells were positive
for both αv and β3 integrin monomers, indicating that
B16F10 melanoma cells were a valid platform for our in
vivo assays. Our hypothesis that a hyperthyroid state will
shorten survival and that a hypothyroid state will prolong
life in an ocular melanoma murine model was confirmed,
in support of the body of evidence showing the association
of thyroid hormone levels and cancer [9, 12].
It has been established that the B16F10 cell line
metastasizes predominantly to the lungs [21] and this
was confirmed in all of the animals sampled in our study,
implying that it was the tumors’ systemic spread that
killed the mice. Additional support came from our internal
control group that unambiguously showed that the mice
died of the tumor and not as a result of their unbalanced
thyroid status. Finally, Theodossiou and co-workers had
shown that tumor responses are a result of the hypothyroid
state rather than PTU in a lung and prostate cancer murine
model, and our results in a UM murine model are in
agreement with theirs [22].
Analysis of the inoculation-to-tumor and tumorto-death time frames revealed similar trends not only for
the metastatic disease, but also for the impact of thyroid
hormone levels on the intraocular tumor. These results
were best reflected in the significant differences between
the PTU and thyroxine groups, which represent the two
ends of the thyroid function spectrum. It is possible that
inclusion of larger numbers of mice in the current study
would have resulted in even more significant differences,
compared to controls. One possible implication of these
results is that it would appear to be worthwhile to combine
the beneficial impact of the hypothyroid state with local
treatment modalities to the intraocular tumor. We believe
that further investigation of this concept has considerable
merit.
In a literature search of tumor cells inoculation
we found that in all studies around 105 cells (range: 1–5
X 105 cells) were injected into the posterior or anterior
chambers [14, 16, 17, 23, 24]. When amounts of cells of
this size were used in preliminary studies, the eyes burst
at about one week after inoculation, limiting the chance
for a therapeutic effect. We therefore diluted the number
of cells to be inoculated in our study to 102 cells/1 µL,
and an inoculum of this size was found to provide a
reliable, reproducible and, importantly, effective model
that simulated the natural course of the disease.
Since the mitogenic effects of thyroid hormones
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

presented in this work are mediated via the αvβ3 integrin,
we searched the literature for its presence on human
primary UM cells, and found that it is expressed in all
tumor subtypes, including spindle, epithelioid and mixed
cell tumors [25], suggesting the testing of the integrin
expression as a therapeutic approach. Nowadays, in many
ocular oncology centers intraocular tumor biopsies for
prognostic purposes are considered common practice [26].
The tissue obtained may serve to evaluate the integrin
abundance on tumor cells as well, and, if present, the
patient may be a candidate for treatment. The evidence
that supports mediation by αvβ3 of the thyroid hormone
effect in the current study is incomplete, but includes
several important observations. The B16F10 cells express
the integrin. The animals were treated with PTU, an
agent that blocks T4 to T3 conversion, and thus the critical
intracellular thyroid hormone, T3, could not be generated.
T4 in physiological concentrations is a hormone, rather
than a prohormone, at the cell surface thyroid hormone
receptor on αvβ3; in a variety of tumor cell model systems,
T4 has been shown to be a proliferative agent via αvβ3
and is the primary ligand of the integrin [27]. In vitro cell
culture studies here confirmed in two human melanoma
cells that T4 in the presence of PTU indeed supported
tumor cell proliferation.
This study has several limitations. As opposed to the
clear-cut time points of inoculation and death, detecting
the beginnings of intraocular tumor growth may be subject
to error. However, it was performed in the same manner
for all the experimental groups, thereby excluding a
potential bias. Although the numbers of animals were large
enough in order to obtain significant survival differences
between the experimental groups, splitting these intervals
into before and after signs of ocular tumor growth were
evident, affected the statistical power, resulting in mixed
results (Figure 4). Nonetheless, trends of the impact of
thyroid status could clearly be identified in these cases, as
well. Substantial strength of the present study lies in the
fact that it is comprised of two identical and independent
experiments, both of which led to similar results.
Intraocular inoculated B16 melanoma cells, although
derived from cutaneous melanoma, are a good platform
and commonly used to model ocular melanoma, including
for the evaluation of novel therapeutic approaches [14,
16, 17, 23, 24]. Although uveal and cutaneous melanoma
cells differ biologically, yet, in the current study a proof of
concept of the impact of the thyroid status on intraocular
melanoma that metastasizes to a distant site and eventually
results in death, was achieved. We are currently testing
various therapeutic modalities (not published) using
a cutaneous melanoma cell line that metastasizes
predominantly to the liver, mimicking UM metastatic
spread. In the present experiments, B16F10 cells only
were used in the animal models, but our cell culture
studies confirmed existence of the proliferative effect of
thyroid hormone (T4) in both B16F10 and Malme-3M

melanoma cells.
Finally, a substantial number of UM patients
develop metastatic disease with attendant poor prognosis
and for which there are no effective treatments. Our
study results indicate that survival in an ocular melanoma
murine model is extended due to induction of the
hypothyroid state and shortened due to a hyperthyroid
state, in support of a growing body of knowledge that
supports an association between thyroid hormone levels
and cancer cell proliferation. These findings and the
beneficial effect of the hypothyroid state on the primary
tumor suggest that there also might be therapeutic benefit
in the induction of mild biochemical hypothyroidism[12]
in this tumor setting or, alternatively, of administering
novel integrin αvβ3-targeted therapies[27, 28] as soon
as the primary uveal tumor is diagnosed. Further in vivo
investigations are warranted to substantiate the impact of
thyroid hormone status on ocular melanoma.

Experimental groups and inoculation of tumor
cells
Figure 2 demonstrates the treatment schedules used
in this study, which consisted of two identical independent
experiments. A hypothyroid state was induced in 9 mice
by adding PTU (Sigma-Aldrich Israel Ltd. Rehovot, Israel,
1 mg/mL) to their drinking water and a hyperthyroid state
was induced in 11 mice by adding thyroxine (SigmaAldrich Israel Ltd., 6 µg/mL) to drinking water. Eight
additional mice were given plain tap water and served as
controls. After 21 days (Figure 2, experimental groups,
day 0), the subretinal space of each mouse’s right eye was
inoculated with aliquots of 102 B16F10 cells/1 µL PBS
using a transconjunctival approach as previously described
[18]. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine
and xylazine (120 mg/kg ketamine, 10 mg/kg xylazine),
and the experimental eye was desensitized by a drop of
oxybuprocaine (Dr. Fischer, Bnei Barak, Israel). Under
a dissecting microscope, a 30 gauge needle was inserted
approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus through the
conjunctiva and sclera and into the subretinal space. The
tip of a 10 µL glass syringe with a 32 gauge blunt needle
(Hamilton Co., Bonaduz, Switzerland) was introduced
into the subretinal space via the needle track, and a 1 µL
suspension of tumor cells was then injected into the eyes
of the animals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and expression of integrin αvβ3
B16F10 mouse melanoma cell line (ATCC, CRL6475) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented
with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM
L-glutamine and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin), in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 370C. Given that
the αvβ3 integrin contains a receptor site for T3 and T4,
we measured the expression of this integrin on B16F10
melanoma cells which were utilized in the animal models.
B16F10 melanoma cells (100,000 cells) were harvested
and labeled with 50 µg/ml PE-αv antibodies (Clone RMV7, Abcam), and FITC-β3 antibodies (Clone HM beta 3.1,
Abcam) in 100 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Following incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature,
the cells were centrifuged, diluted in PBS and analyzed by
a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS, Navios Flow
Cytometer; Beckman Coulter, Inc). For in vitro studies,
Malme-3M cells (ATCC HTB-64) and B16F10 cells were
cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% hormonestripped FBS [13]. L-T4 and propylthiouracil for these
studies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Treatment of
harvested cells and western blotting for proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) were by our previously reported
methods [13].

Clinical follow-up and study definitions
All of the mice were checked daily for clinical
evidence of intraocular tumor growth. These signs
appeared in the form of intraocular bleeding, turbidity,
or both in preliminary experiments (data not shown).
When any of these signs became evident, the mouse was
transferred to a separate cage and followed-up until death.
The interval between inoculation of tumor cells and death
was defined as the survival time. The interval between
inoculation of tumor cells and first clinical evidence of
intraocular tumor growth was defined as the inoculationto-tumor time, and the interval between first clinical
evidence of intraocular tumor growth to death was defined
as the tumor-to-death time. All of these data was recorded
and analyzed.

Animals
Study animals were wild-type male C57BL/6 mice
aged 8 weeks (Harlan Laboratories Ltd, Ein Kerem,
Jerusalem). The mice were acclimated to our vivarium for
1 week prior to their use according to study protocols. Up
to 6 animals were housed in a cage under conventional

survival data, the inoculation–tumor time and the tumor–
death time between groups. A Kaplan-Meier plot was
generated graphically to demonstrate the survival curves
of the experimental groups. Group differences in FT4
values were analyzed using post hoc Tukey test one-way
ANOVA. Analysis of the in vitro cell proliferation studies
was by Student’s t test.

Eighteen additional non-inoculated mice were
treated with PTU, thyroxine or plain water (n=6 in each
group) for 21 days and their thyroid function was assessed
(Figure 2, Thyroid status, day 0). Thyroid function was
measured by obtaining blood samples with a small glass
capillary tube positioned behind the eye in the ophthalmic
venous plexus. Serum free T4 (FT4) levels were determined
using a FT4 radioimmunoassay kit (Beckman Coulter
Oslo, Norway), after which the mice were sacrificed.

Internal control group
Eleven additional non-inoculated mice (Figure 2,

PTU (n=3), thyroxine (n=4) or tap water (n=4). These
mice served as internal control in each of the study
groups in order to determine the systemic impact of the
dissolved substance. They were followed-up on a daily
basis and sacrificed 2 months after the last mouse of the
experimental group had died (blood samples had been
obtained for FT4 level determination beforehand).
