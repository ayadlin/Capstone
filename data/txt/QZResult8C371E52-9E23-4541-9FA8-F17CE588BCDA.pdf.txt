ABSTRACT
Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), an emerging molecular target
for cancer therapy, contributes to cancer proliferation, cell survival, tumorigenesis,
and invasion, disease progression and drug resistance. Although eEF2K is highly upregulated in various cancers, the mechanism of gene regulation has not been elucidated.
In this study, we examined the role of Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) proto-oncogenic
transcription factor in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and the regulation
of eEF2K. We found that FOXM1 is highly upregulated in TNBC and its knockdown
by RNA interference (siRNA) significantly inhibited eEF2K expression and suppressed
cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and induced apoptotic cell
death, recapitulating the effects of eEF2K inhibition. Knockdown of FOXM1 inhibited
regulators of cell cycle, migration/invasion and survival, including cyclin D1, Src and
MAPK-ERK signaling pathways, respectively. We also demonstrated that FOXM1 (1B and
1C isoforms) directly binds to and transcriptionally regulates eEF2K gene expression
by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase gene reporter assays.
Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of FOXM1 by liposomal siRNA-nanoparticles suppressed
growth of MDA-MB-231 TNBC tumor xenografts in orthotopic models. In conclusion,
our study provides the first evidence about the transcriptional regulation of eEF2K in
TNBC and the role of FOXM1 in mediating breast cancer cell proliferation, survival,
migration/invasion, progression and tumorgenesis and highlighting the potential of
FOXM1/eEF2K axis as a molecular target in breast and other cancers.

INTRODUCTION

the biology of this complex cancer and to develop better
therapeutic strategies to improve patient survival [2].
Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1), a member of the FOX
protein family characterized by a conserved winged-helix
DNA binding domain [3], promotes cell cycle progression
by inducing both transition from G1 to S phase and
transition from G2 to M phase [4–11]. Recent studies
demonstrated that elevated FOXM1 expression is found
in a wide variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian,
colon, liver, pancreatic and gastric cancers; Ewing
sarcoma; hepatocellular carcinoma, and cervical cancer
[10–16]. Moreover, expression of FOXM1 is correlated

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy
and the second leading cause of cancer- related death
in women [1]. Patient deaths are attributed to lack of
therapeutic options following development of resistance
to standard therapies (i.e., chemotherapy and radiotherapy)
and metastatic disease [2]. The poor outcomes, especially
in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are largely due to
lack of known therapeutic targets (e.g., estrogen receptor
[ER] or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
[HER2]), highlighting the crucial need to better understand

with a clinically aggressive, drug-resistant, cancer
phenotype and poor patient survival [17–21]. FOXM1 is
regulated by oncogenic signals, including growth factors,
and suppressed by p53 tumor suppressor protein, which
is mutated in half of human cancers [22, 23]. FOXM1 is
considered an emerging target in breast cancer due to its
oncogenic role and high overexpression rate in 85% of
TNBCs, which also have a high p53 mutation frequency
(~80% of cases) [24–31]. Recently, analysis of The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer database also
identified FOXM1 as the key transcriptional driver in the
differentially expressed gene signature of TNBC [29, 31],
demonstrating the significance of FOXM1 as a driver of
proliferation and disease progression [29].
Eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 Kinase (eEF2K), a
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent Ser/Thr kinase that regulates
protein synthesis through phosphorylation of eEF2 [32–35],
has been shown to be involved in mediating autophagy and
cell survival in nutrient deprivation and hypoxia [32, 33].
Recently, we showed that eEF2K promotes TNBC cell
proliferation, invasion and tumorigenesis, and resistance
to chemotherapy by inducing oncogenic signaling
pathways related to cell growth, survival, invasion,
angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in
pancreatic cancer [36–38]. eEF2K is overexpressed in
solid cancers, including pancreatic and colon cancer and
glioblastoma, and correlates with poor patient survival
[36–40]. Therapeutic inhibition of eEF2K prevents tumor
growth and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy in preclinical TNBC models in mice [36], indicating that eEF2K
is an important regulator of tumor growth and progression
and a potential therapeutic target in TNBC. However, the
molecular mechanism regulating eEF2K gene expression
remains largely unknown.
In this study we investigated the role of FOXM1
oncogenic transcription factor in TNBC biology and
regulation of eEF2K. We demonstrated that FOXM1
transcriptionally regulates eEF2K by binding to the
promoter region and mediates some of the tumorigenic
effects of FOXM1, as down-regulation of FOXM1
inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration/
invasion and tumorigenesis, recapitulating the effects of
eEF2K down-modulation in TNBC.

FOXM1 expression is highly up-regulated in
breast cancer cells
The baseline expression of FOXM1 was determined
in various human breast cancer cell lines and nontumorigenic human breast cells (MCF10A) by Western
blot analysis. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells
(MDA-MB-231, BT-20) had higher FOXM1 expression
than other breast cancer cell lines, including the ER-positive
T-47D, and ZR-75.1 cells and the HER2/Neu-positive
SKBR3 cells (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1).
BT-20 and MDA-MB-231 cells were therefore used for all
subsequent experiments.

Inhibition of FOXM1B and FOXM1C isoforms
suppresses cell growth and colony formation in
TNBC cells
Transcription of the FOXM1 locus results in three
differentially spliced mRNAs, leading to expression of
three isoforms of FOXM1 (1-A, 1-B, and 1-C). Although all
three isoforms of FOXM1 can bind to DNA, only FOXM1-B
and FOXM1-C have been shown to be transcriptionally
active (5, 42). FOXM1-A, which contains extra A1 and
A2 domains from exons Va and exon VIIa, respectively,
is transcriptionally inactive due to the presence of an A2
domain that disrupts the transactivation activity [43].
The cells were transfected with control siRNA
or two different FOXM1 siRNAs, and total RNA was
isolated 72 h after the transfection and analyzed by
RT-PCR. Compared with the expression of FOXM1-B
and -1-C in control siRNA-transfected cells, the expression
of the two isoforms was suppressed in cells transfected
with two different FOXM1 siRNA (Figure 2). These
results showed that the FOXM1 siRNA can effectively
knock down FOXM1 expression at the transcriptional
level and be used to study FOXM1-mediated effects.
We next examined the effects of FOXM1-B
(FOXM1#2) and FOXM1-C (FOXM1#1) siRNAs on cell
proliferation and colony formation in MDA-MB-231 and

antibody against FOXM1. β-Actin was used as a loading control. FOXM1 protein was highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines compared
with its expression in non-tumorigenic human breast cells (MCF10A).

Knockdown of FOXM1 impairs cell motility,
migration and invasion of TNBC cells

BT-20 cells by using a clonogenic assay, which measures
the ability of tumor cells to grow and form foci [44]. In
this assay, normal cells are contact inhibited and do not
form colonies, while cancer cells do form colonies; thus,
the assay measures the neoplastic propensity of cancer
cells. Clonogenicity was evaluated by plating fixed
numbers of cells into tissue culture dishes and culturing
for 2 weeks. Down-regulation of FOXM1B and -1C by
specific siRNAs resulted in a marked reduction of colony
formation compared with colony formation in the control
siRNA-transfected MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells
(p < 0.05, Figure 3). We also examined the shortterm effects of FOXM1-B and FOXM1-C siRNAs on
proliferation of the two cell lines at 72 h by MTS assay.
Down-regulation of FOXM1 significantly reduced
the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells compared
with the control siRNA-transfected cells (p < 0.001,
Supplementary Figure 2). These results demonstrated that
expression of the FOXM1 transcription factor is essential
for proliferation and colony formation of TNBC cells.

To assess whether FOXM1 is involved in cell
motility and migration of TNBC cells, we performed an
in vitro scratch wound healing assay. MDA-MB-231 cells
were plated in a six-well plates and transfected with siRNA
targeting FOXM1-B or -C; 72 h after transfection, a single
scratch wound was created in the well, and the cells were
monitored for 48 h. Cells treated with control siRNA were
able to migrate and completely close the wound, while
cells treated with FOXM1 siRNA had limited migration
and did not fill the gap after 48 h (Figure 4A, p < 0.05).
Next, we examined if FOXM1 is involved in cell invasion
by performing in vitro cell invasion assays using Matrigelcoated Boyden chambers. We found that down-regulation
of FOXM1 by the two FOXM1 siRNAs inhibited
the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231cells compared to
the invasiveness of the control siRNA-transfected cells,
with markedly fewer cells invading the bottom well

Cells were transfected with 50 nM FOXM1#1 or FOXM1#2 siRNA or control siRNAs. Total RNA was isolated 72 h after transfection, and
FOXM1 mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. The two different FOXM1 siRNAs significantly inhibited the expression of FOXM1
mRNA in both MDA-MB-231 (A, B) and BT-20 (C, D) cells. FOXM1#1 siRNA inhibited FOXM1-C, and FOXM1#2 siRNA suppressed
FOXM1-B. GAPDH expression was used as a control. Data are represented as mean ± SD. *represents significant difference between

inducing clinically significant signaling pathways [45].
Because FOXM1 is also involved in these functions in
breast cancer cells, we hypothesized that FOXM1 may
transcriptionally regulate eEF2K expression.
To test this hypothesis, we conducted Western blot
and RT-PCR analyses to determine if the expression
levels of eEF2K protein and mRNA, respectively, are
inhibited after FOXM1 is silenced by siRNA. Knockdown
with FOXM1-B or -1-C siRNA significantly inhibited
expression of both eEF2K protein and eEF2K mRNA in
both MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells (Figure 6A–6H).
To determine the effect of increased FOXM1
expression on eEF2K expression, we transfected
MDA-MB-231 cells with the FOXM1 expression vector
or the empty vector. We found that these cells exhibited
significantly increased eEF2K protein expression
(Figure 6I–6L). Overall, these results suggest that FOXM1
is involved in eEF2K expression in breast cancer cells.

(p < 0.01, Figure 4B), indicating the involvement of
FOXM1 in cell invasiveness. Overall, our findings
suggest that FOXM1 promotes cell motility, migration,
and invasion in TNBC cells.

Down-regulation of FOXM1 promotes apoptotic
death of TNBC cells
To determine whether FOXM1 is involved in cell
survival and whether inhibition of FOXM1 induces
apoptosis, we knocked down FOXM1 in MDA-MB-231
cells, using the two different FOXM1 siRNAs and
assessed apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis was quantitatively
analyzed using annexin V/propidium iodide staining assay.
Down-regulation of FOXM1 resulted in a significant
increase in the number of apoptotic MDA-MB-231 cells
(p < 0.01, Figure 5), suggesting that expression of FOXM1
promotes cell survival and prevents apoptotic cell death in
breast cancer cells.

To provide a direct link between FOXM1 and

We recently demonstrated that eEF2K promotes

end, we performed standard ChIP assays. Briefly, using
the Align Sequences Nucleotide BLAST program, we
looked for the consensus FOXM1-binding sequence in
the promoter sequence of the eEF2K gene. We found four
different FOXM1-binding consensus sequences in the
eEF2K promoter region (Supplementary Figure 3). Next,
the cross-linked and sonicated human chromatin prepared
from MDA-MB-231 cells was immunoprecipitated
with antibodies specific to either FOXM1 or RNA
polymerase. Normal mouse IgG serum was used as a
negative control. The genomic DNA associated with the
immunoprecipitated chromatin was amplified by PCR
with primers specific to the human eEF2K gene promoter
region, as described in Materials and Methods (Figure 7).
As shown in Figure 8A–8B, anti-FOXM1 antibody,
but not the control antibodies, precipitated the EF2K
promoter fragment containing the BS7 sequence (−1359
to −1558; Figure 7B). We also performed a control ChIP
assay. Specific primers were designed to amplify the
promoter fragment containing the BS7 sequence, and
the immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR.
The ChIP experiment demonstrated that FOXM1 bound to
eEF2K promoter (Figure 8C).
To further investigate whether FOXM1 regulates
eEF2K promoter activity, we used the luciferase
reporter assay. We knocked down FOXM1 by
co-transfecting FOXM1 siRNA and the plasmid vector
pGL3 incorporating eEF2K promoter into MDA-MB-231
cells. Conversely, to assess the effect of increased FOXM1
expression on eEF2K transcription, we also co-transfected
cells with the FOXM1 expression vector and the pGL3eEF2K promoter vector. We prepared protein extracts
from MDA-MB-231 cells at 40 h following transfection

and measured dual-luciferase activity. The co-transfection
experiments with FOXM1 siRNA demonstrated that
eEF2K promoter activity was reduced, while FOXM1
expression led to an increase in eEF2K promoter activity
(Figure 8D–8E). Taken together, the results from the
ChIP and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the
eEF2K promoter region is a direct transcriptional target
of FOXM1 and that FOXM binds to the promoter of the
eEF2K gene and induces eEF2K expression.

Knockdown of FOXM1 inhibits mediators of
the cell cycle, cell survival, and cell invasiveness
in TNBC cells
As indicated by the data in Figure 3 and
Supplementary Figure 2, FOXM1 plays a critical role in
cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in TNBC cells.
We also examined whether inhibition of FOXM1 leads
to inhibition of signaling pathways or mediators of these
cellular events. We first examined previously reported
indirect downstream targets of eEF2K [36] in breast cancer
cells. Transfection with FOXM1#1 or #2 siRNA reduced
the levels of cyclin D1 (which promotes the cell cycle entry
by inducing G1/S phase transition), p-Src-Tyr416 (which
is one of the most important mediators of cell invasion),
and pERK-EF2-Thr56 (a direct target phosphorylated
by eEF2K), which as components of the ERK-MAPK
pathway, control cell proliferation [46] (Figure 9). Western
blot analysis revealed that knockdown of FOXM1 markedly
reduced p-ERK in BT-20 cells but not in MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 9A–9B), indicating that FOXM1 regulates
eEF2K and its downstream molecular targets in TNBC.

DISCUSSION

In vivo therapeutic targeting of FOXM1 by
siRNA inhibits growth of orthotopic TNBC
xenograft tumors in mice

FOXM1 transcription factor is considered as
one of the key transcriptional drivers of TNBC and the
master regulator of tumor metastasis, promoting cell
invasion and disease progression. [6, 7]. However,
downstream molecular targets of FOXM1 still remains
to be determined. eEF2K is an emerging therapeutic
target in TNBC and other aggressive cancers including
pancreatic, and colon cancers and glioblastoma, and its
overexpression correlates with poor patient survival
[36–40, 45]. However, the molecular mechanisms
regulating eEF2K gene expression is largely unknown.
Here we provided the first evidence that eEF2K expression
is transcriptionally regulated by FOXM1 and that the
FOXM1/eEF2K axis promotes cell TNBC proliferation,
survival, migration/invasion and contributes to tumor
growth and progression.
The FOXM1-B and FOXM1-C isoforms have been
shown to be elevated in numerous human cancers [7].
Several studies demonstrated that FOXM1-B enhances cell

To determine the in vivo role of FOXM1 in the
TNBC tumorigenesis and its potential as a therapeutic
target we further assessed the effects of FOXM1 inhibition
in an orthotopic xenograft model MDA-MB-231 in mice.
MDA-MB-231 cells were implanted into the mammary fat
pad of nude mice by subcutaneous injection and about
2 weeks later two different FOXM1 siRNA (#1 and #2)
and non-silencing control siRNA (0.3 mg/kg, i.v. from tail
vein) incorporated in DMPC-based nanoliposomes were
injected into mice once a week for four weeks. As shown
in Figure 10, mice treated with liposomal FOXM1 siRNA
had significantly smaller tumors compared with those
treated control siRNA treated group (n = 5 animals/group,
p < 0.05) (Figure 10A). Analysis of tumors after four
weeks of the treatment with by liposomal FOXM1 siRNA
treatments showed significant FOXM1 protein levels down
modulation compared to control tumors (Figure 10B).

amplified by PCR using the speciﬁc primers and resolved on 1.2% agarose gels. ChIP assay demonstrated that FOXM1 protein bound to
the promoter region of the eEF2K gene. (C) To confirm this finding, immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR with primers speciﬁc
to eEF2K gene promoter fragment containing BS7. The assay results confirmed the binding of FOXM1 to the eEF2K gene promoter.

were preapared and analyzed for dual-luciferase activity. Triplicate plates were used to calculate the mean fold induction of transcriptional
activity. The luciferase activity values are relative to the activity of the cotransfected renilla luciferase. The luciferase reporter assay
demonstrated that inhibition of FOXM1 expression led to down-regulation of eEF2K activity and that expression of FOXM1 resulted in
increased eEF2K activity. The data are means with standard deviations. *represents significant difference between indicated groups.

migration and invasion, while FOXM1-C promotes cell
proliferation, cell migration and invasion in cervical and
ovarian cancers [24, 41]. Both FOXM1-B and FOXM1-C
play important roles in pancreatic cancer cell biology,
but FOXM1-C is more relevant to pancreatic cancer
development [46]. In our study FOXM1-B and -1-C had
similar effects on eEF2K expression and cell proliferation,
migration, invasion and in vivo tumor growth in
TNBC model.
Constitutive activation of ERK signaling is
associated with neoplastic transformation and plays
crucial roles in cell survival, apoptosis, and migration
during TNBC development and progression [41, 47, 48].
Our results indicate that FOXM1 regulates ERK signaling
in breast cancer cells and support previous findings
suggesting that FOXM1 is one of the major upstream
effectors of ERK signaling in human hepatocellular
carcinoma [49]. ERK activation has also been shown
to be involved in FOXM1 phosphorylation, nuclear
translocation, and enhanced FOXM1 transcriptional

activity and to promote downstream target gene
expression in some cancers [41, 50]. ERK activity is
increased in breast cancer and associated with reduced
cell differentiation, larger tumors, higher disease stages,
and poorer prognosis in breast cancer [51]. Interestingly,
in our study the activity of ERK was not altered by
FOXM1 inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells, which have
K-Ras and p53 mutations, suggesting that constitutive
K-Ras activity may override FOXM1-mediated ERK
activation [52].
FOXM1 is known to regulate the expression of a
number of cell cycle genes, including the cyclin D1 gene
[9, 3, 10, 11]. Cyclin D1 plays a key role in G1 phase,
G1/S transition, and oncogenesis [53]. In the present
study, knockdown of FOXM1 led to a marked reduction
in cyclin D1 expression, which was recently shown to
be regulated by eEF2K in breast cancer cells [36]. Our
observations confirm the earlier studies indicating that the
FOXM1/eEF2K axis plays a role in cell cycle progression.
Considering its role in promotion cell cycle entrance,

FOXM1 expression vector

significant down regulation (~90% reduction) of CyclinD1
in all cell lines following with FOXM1 siRNA treatments,
cell cycle inhibition may be the major cause of almost
complete abrogation of the colony formation rather than
apoptosis induction. Furthermore, the oncogenic effects of
cyclin D1 is well established and inhibition of CyclinD1
inhibits not only tumor cell growth or proliferation
also suppresses tumor growth in mice, indicating the
significance of FOXM1/EF2K/CyclinD1 axis in TNBC
cancer biology and progression.
Overall, FOXM1 promotes important biological
processes in TNBC cells, including cell survival,
proliferation, invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis
through regulating multiple signaling pathways
including eEF2K and inhibition of FOXM1/eEF2K
axis significantly block these events and tumor growth
of TNBC, indicating that FOXM1 is a critical driver
of progression of breast cancer and other cancers,
representing a potential therapeutic target [5, 9, 10, 11].
Our results indicate that the FOXM1 plays an important
role in breast cancer progression by transcriptionally
regulating eEF2-Kinase expression which is an equally
important and an emerging target in TNBC and other
solid tumors.

A FOXM1 expression plasmid was purchased from
Sino Biological Inc. (Beijing, China; catalog number
HG12392-G-N). MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected
with the FOXM1 expression vector or an empty control
vector (400 ng/well) using HiPerFect. At 40 h after
transfection, the cells were collected and protein levels
were analyzed by Western blotting.

Western blot analysis
Cells were seeded in 25-cm2 culture flasks (3.5 × 105
cells/4 ml medium). Following treatment, the cells were
collected, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and lysed in a lysis buffer at 4°C. The total
protein concentration for each sample was determined
with a detergent-compatible protein assay kit (DC kit; BioRad, Hercules, CA), and Western blotting was performed.
Aliquots containing 40 µg of total protein from each
sample were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a 4%-to-20%
gradient for protein separation and electrotransferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes
were blocked with a blocking buffer (0.1 Triton X-100
with 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline–Tween 20
[TBS-T]) for 60 min. After being washed with TBS-T,
the membranes were probed with the following primary
antibodies: FOXM1 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Dallas, TX), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),
and p-ERK (Thr-202) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX) and eEF-2K, p-EF2 (Thr-56), EF2, cyclin D1, Src,
and p-Src (Tyr-416) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA). After being washed with TBS-T, the membranes
were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham
Life Science, Cleveland, OH). Mouse anti-β-actin
(primary) and donkey anti-mouse (secondary) (Sigma
Chemical, St, Louis, MO) was used as a loading control.
All antibodies were diluted in TBS-T containing 5% dry
milk. Chemiluminescence detection was performed with
ChemiGlow detection reagents (ProteinSimple; Labtech,
Uckfield, United Kingdom), and the blots were visualized
with a FluorChem 8900 Imager and quantified with a
densitometer using the imager application program (Alpha
Innotech, San Leandro, CA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, culture conditions, and reagents
Human breast cancer cell lines were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle
medium/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), except for nontumorigenic human breast cells (MCF10A from ATCC),
which were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium/
F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, epidermal
growth factor, hydrocortisone, insulin, and cholera toxin
(Calbiochem). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified
incubator with 5% CO2.

Transfection with siRNA
Two different FOXM1 small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) and non-silencing control siRNAs were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Exponentially growing
untreated cells were plated 24 h before transfection.
Plated cells were transfected with FOXM1 siRNA or
a control siRNA at a final concentration of 50 nM for
72 h, using HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The concentrations of siRNAs were chosen based on
dose-response studies. Non-silencing control siRNAtransfected cells were used as negative controls. After
treatment, the cells were harvested and processed for
further analysis.

Cell viability and proliferation assays
Cell viability and proliferation were measured
by
MTS
(3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium)
assay (Promega, Madison, WI) after treatment. Cells
were counted using a hemocytometer, and viable cells
were identified by trypan blue exclusion. The identified
16630

Oncotarget

cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1.25 × 103 cells/well)
and transfected with siRNAs. After 72 h of incubation,
a solution containing MTS and phenazine methosulfate
(20:1 v/v) was added to the cells. After 2–3 h of incubation
at 37°C, the number of viable growing cells was estimated
by measuring absorption at 490 nm, based on generation of
formazan by the cells.

a non- 
silencing control siRNA or two different
FOXM1siRNAs (50 nM), and grown for 2 weeks. The
cells were washed with PBS and stained with crystal
violet, and visible colonies were counted.

Matrigel invasion assay
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with 50 nM
siRNA, and 72 h later, equal numbers of treated viable
cells (5 × 104 cells) were seeded onto Matrigel-coated
Transwell filters (8-µm-pore-size) in Matrigel Invasion
Chambers (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The number
of cells that invaded the lower side of the membrane after
24 h was determined by counting cells in a minimum of
four randomly selected areas.

RNA isolation and reverse transcriptase-PCR
(RT-PCR)
Following treatment, total cellular RNA was
isolated from the collected cells with TRIzol Reagent
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and complementary
DNA (cDNA) was obtained from 1 µg of total RNA using
the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life
Technologies) The cDNAs for FOXM1B, FOXM1C,
eEF2K and GAPDH were amplified using the Platinum
Taq DNA Polymerase kit (Life Technologies) with specific
gene primers. Brieﬂy, 2 µl of the total 20 µl of the reversetranscribed product was used for PCR in 1x PCR buffer
containing 1.5 mM MgCl2; 200 µM deoxynucleotide
triphosphates; 1 unit of Platinum Taq polymerase; and 0.2 µM
FOXM1B-, FOXM1C-, or eEF2K- (Integrated DNA
Technologies, Coralville, IA) or GAPDH (Life Technologies)speciﬁc primer. Primer sequences were as follows:
FOXM1B sense, 5′-TTGCCCCCAAGGTGCTGC
TA-3′ (41) 
FOXM1B antisense, 5′- GGAGATTGGGACGAATC
CTC-3′ (41)
FOXM1C sense, 5′-CACCCATCACCAGCTTGT

eEF2K sense, 5′-GGAGAGAGTCGAAGGTC
ACG-3′ (37)
eEF2K antisense, 5′-GCAATCAGCCAAGACCAT
CT-3′’ (37)
The cDNA samples were incubated at 94°C
(2–5 min) to denature the template and activate the
enzyme. This step was followed by 35 cycles of PCR
amplification (as 94°C for 5 min, 95°C for 30 sec, 57°C
for 30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec with FOXM1B and
FOXM1C primers; 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec,
and 72°C for 60 sec with eEF2K primers, in each cycle).
The PCR reaction was terminated with final extension
step of 10 min and 5 min at 72°C, respectively. The
amplified reaction products were analyzed on a 1.2%
agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The relative
amounts of gene products were verified by detection of
the GAPDH transcript, which was used as an internal
control.

Cell migration and motility
Cells were seeded in six-well plates (5 × 105 cells/
well) and 24 h later were transfected with the control
siRNA or two different FOXM1 siRNAs (50 nM). After
72-h incubation, a scratch was created in the monolayer
in each well using the tip of a sterile 1000-µl pipette, the
cells were gently washed with medium to remove detached
cells, and fresh medium was added. Cells in the scratched
area were imaged at 0 and 48 h using microscopy, and
the distance traveled by cells at the leading edge of the
wound at each time point was measured. The results were
expressed as percent migration.

Analysis of apoptosis
Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V staining
and flow cytometry analysis. Cells were seeded in 25cm2 culture ﬂasks (3.5 × 105 cells/ﬂask), transfected with
siRNA (50 nM) for 72 h, and then analyzed by annexin
V/propidium iodide staining according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (FITC–Annexin V kit; BD Pharmingen, San
Diego, CA). Positive cells were detected and quantiﬁed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
To assess the direct binding of FOXM1 transcription
factor to the promoter region of the eEF2K DNA sequence,
a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was
performed. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were cross-linked
in situ by addition of 37% formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA) to a final concentration of 1% and incubated
at room temperature for 10 min with gentle swirling.
The cross-linking reaction was stopped by addition
of 2.5 M glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M,
and the cells were incubated at room temperature for
5 min with gentle swirling. The medium was aspirated,
and the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then
collected by adding 2 ml of cold PBS containing protease
inhibitors (EZ-ChIP kit 17-371; Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Colony formation and clonogenic assays
MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells were seeded in
6-well plates (1.5 × 103 cells/well); transfected with

Cells were scraped from the dish and transferred into
an Eppendorf tube, which was centrifuged at 700 × g at
4°C for 5 minutes to pellet cells. The cell pellets were
then resuspended in 1 ml of SDS lysis buffer containing
protease inhibitors (EZ-ChIP 17-371; 1 ml of SDS lysis
buffer for every 1 × 107 MDA-MB-231 cells) and placed
on ice. The resulting extract was sonicated to create DNA
fragments between 200 and 1000 bp using a ultrasonic
sonicator (Sonicator, Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, INC,
model W-225). The extract was incubated on ice. At this
stage, the processing of all experimental samples and total
input was carried out according to the Milli pore ChIP
assay protocol (EZ-ChIP 17-371). Ten microliters (1%) of
each sample was used as input. The remaining samples
were used for immunoprecipitation with 10 µl of antiFOXM1 antibody (H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
1 µg of a rabbit antibody (negative control; Amersham Life
Science, Cleveland, OH), 1 µg of anti-RNA polymerase
II (positive control; EZ-ChIP 05-623B; Millipore), or
1 µg of normal mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) serum
(negative control) (EZ-ChIP 12-371B; Millipore). After
the addition of an antibody, each sample was incubated
overnight at 4°C with rotation and washed according to
the Upstate Biotechnology ChIP assay protocol. Crosslinks were reversed for all samples, including input, by
addition of 8 µl of 5 M NaCl, and then the samples were
incubated overnight at 65°C. One microliter of RNase
was then added, and the samples were incubated for 30
min at 37°C. Proteinase K (1 µl), Tris-HCl (1 M, 8 µl),
and EDTA (0.5 M, 4 µl) were added, and the samples
were digested for 2 h at 45°C. DNA was extracted from
the digested samples using PCR purification columns
(EZ-ChIP 20-290 and 20-291; Millipore). Two microliters
of each extracted DNA sample (the input sample and ChIP
DNA sample) was used for PCR amplification in 35 cycles
using primers specific to promoter fragments of the eEF2K
gene and control primers.

Specific primers were designed for the promoter
region (−1558/−1359) of the eEF2K gene where FOXM1
bindinga sides are located. The region was amplified
using the following primers: 5′- TGGTTACTATAA
AAGGCCCAGAT -3′ (sense) and 5′- CAGACCTGGCCA
ATTAGCAT -3′ (antisense). The following the reaction,
the mixture was used for all PCR samples: 2 µl of each
purified ChIP extract, input for PCR in 1x PCR buffer
containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 µM deoxynucleotide
triphosphates, 1 unit of Platinum Taq polymerase, and
0.2 µM each primer (Integrated DNA Technologies) in a
25-µl total volume. The DNA samples were incubated at 94°C
(3 min). This step was followed by 35 cycles of PCR
(94°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min).
The amplified reaction products were analyzed on a
1.2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.

PCR primers and reaction conditions for
ChIP assay
Control primers (EZ-ChIP 22-004; Millipore) were
used for the human GAPDH gene as an internal control.
Two eEF2K promoter regions were identified (with data
from the University of California, Santa Cruz, Genome
Bioinformatics website, http://genome.ucsc.edu), Ten
different primers were designed for two promoter regions
of the eEF2K gene using the Primer3 program (SimGene.

from MDA-MB-231 cells by PCR using the following
primers: 5′-agcaagcttctgctcaactccctggaaaa-3′ (sense) and
5′-AGCAAGCTTgaaaatagccctccccactc-3′
(antisense)
(Integrated DNA Technologies). The PCR-amplified
promoter regions were digested with HindIII (New
Englands Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and inserted into a
pGL3-Basic empty vector (Promega) using T4 DNA ligase
(New England Biolabs). The plasmid minipreparations
were performed with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit
(Qiagen). The eEF2K promoter region was confirmed by
DNA sequencing (Lone Star Labs Inc., Houston, TX). In
addition to, pGL3 containing the eEF2K DNA promoter
region, pGL3-Basic empty vector, a FOXM1 expression
vector (Sino Biological Inc.), and the renilla luciferase
expression plasmid pRLTK was used as internal controls
(Promega).
To up-regulate FOXM1 expression, a pCMVFOXM1 expression vector was transfected into MDAMB-231 cells using HiPerFect. To silence FOXM1
expression, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 24-well
plates (8 × 104 cells/well) and transfected with FOXM1
siRNA or control siRNA. After 24-h incubation, the cells
were transfected with non-silencing control siRNA or
FOXM1 siRNA (50 nM) and 2 ng/µl of pCMV-FOXM1
expression vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection,
cells were co-transfected with 2 ng/µl of the pGL3Basic vector, 2 ng/µl of pGL3 containing the eEF2K
DNA promoter region, 2 ng/µl of the pGL3 control
expression vector, and 0.8 ng/µl of the pRLTK renilla
luciferase expression plasmid. Plasmids and siRNAs were
transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells using HiPerFect. At
40 h after transfection, cells were harvested and protein
extracts were prepared for the Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay (Promega). Luciferase activity in control or
FOXM1siRNA-transfected cells was normalized for
transfection efficiency to renilla luciferase activity, and the
results were compared with those for the cells transfected
with the pGL3-Basic empty vector.

Athymic Nu/Nu female mice (4–5 week old) were
obtained from the Department of Experimental Radiation
Oncology at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.
All studies were conducted according to an experimental
protocol approved by the M. D. Anderson Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. MDA-MB-231 cells
(2 × 106 in 20% matrigel) were injected into the mammary
fat pad of each mouse. Two weeks after injection, when
tumors reached about 3–5 mm in size, liposomal siRNA
treatments (I.v from tail vein) were initiated. Each mouse
received 0.3 mg/kg siRNA (control or FOXM1 siRNA)
incorporated in liposomes once a week (equivalent of 8 ug/
mouse) for four weeks and tumor volumes were measured
weakly by a caliper. After completion of treatments, mice
were euthanized with CO2, tumor tissues were removed,
lysed and analyzed by Western blot.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were conducted at least in triplicate,
and the results were summarized as means with standard
deviations. Statistical significance was determined using
the Student t test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
