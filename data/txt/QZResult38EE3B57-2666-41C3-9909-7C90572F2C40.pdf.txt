BACKGROUND: Dasatinib, an inhibitor of Src/Abl family kinases, can inhibit tumor growth of several solid tumors.
However, the effect and mechanism of action of dasatinib in human ovarian cancer cells remains unknown.
METHODS: Dasatinib-induced autophagy was determined by acridine orange staining, punctate localization of GFPLC3, LC3 protein blotting, and electron microscopy. Significance of beclin 1, AKT, and Bcl-2 in dasatinib-induced
autophagy and growth inhibition was assayed by small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing and/or overexpression of
the gene of interest. RESULTS: Dasatinib inhibited cell growth by inducing little apoptosis, but substantial autophagy
in SKOv3 and HEY ovarian cancer cells. In vivo studies showed dasatinib inhibited tumor growth and induced both
autophagy and apoptosis in a HEY xenograft model. Knockdown of beclin 1 and Atg12 expression with their respective siRNAs diminished dasatinib-induced autophagy, whereas knockdown of p27Kip1 with specific siRNAs did not.
Small hairpin RNA knockdown of beclin 1 expression reduced dasatinib-induced autophagy and growth inhibition.
Dasatinib reduced the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, p70S6K, and S6 kinase expression. Constitutive expression of
AKT1 and AKT2 inhibited dasatinib-induced autophagy in both HEY and SKOv3 cells. Dasatinib also reduced Bcl-2
expression and activity. Overexpression of Bcl-2 partially prevented dasatinib-induced autophagy. CONCLUSIONS:
Dasatinib induces autophagic cell death in ovarian cancer that partially depends on beclin 1, AKT, and Bcl-2. These

Dasatinib, a dual inhibitor of Src and Abl tyrosine kinase, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration

for second-line treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia.1,2 Recently, several preclinical studies have demonstrated
that dasatinib inhibits growth of a variety of solid tumors, including breast, prostate, brain, skin, bone, soft tissues, lung,
head and neck, colon, and pancreatic cancers.1-7 Several mechanisms underlie dasatinib-induced suppression of leukemia
and solid tumors, including G1 arrest of the cell cycle,1,4,7 induction of apoptosis,1-4,7 and inhibition of cell migration/
invasion/metastasis.1-8 However, the effect of dasatinib and the role of autophagy, a type II programmed cell death, in
dasatinib-treated ovarian cancer cells has not been reported.
Autophagy is an intracellular degradative mechanism for eliminating damaged organelles and long-lived proteins.9,10 The process of autophagy can be divided into the following steps: signaling initiation, membrane nucleation, vesicle elongation, autophagosome formation, autophagolysosome formation, and content degradation.11 Autophagosomes
are defined ultrastructurally as intracellular, double-membraned vesicles that contain damaged organelles and proteins
and membrane-bound protein called microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II). LC3-II is modified from
LC3-I by cleavage and phosphatidylethanolamine at the C-terminus and binds tightly to autophagosomal membrane.12
The amount of LC3-II is correlated with the extent of the autophagosome formation.13 Level of p62/SQSTM1 (p62), a
multifunctional protein that targets proteins to degradation by proteasomes and autophagy, is also correlated with the
extent of the autophagosome formation.14 Intact and increased autophagy function decreases p62 protein.14
The phosphoinositide-3 kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase pathways play major roles in
regulating the formation of autophagosomes.9,10 A series of proteins encoded by autophagy genes (Atg) execute the

process of autophagy.9,10 Beclin 1 (Atg6), a Bcl-2 interacting protein, plays a role in autophagy induction.15 In
addition, beclin 1, Atg14, Vps34, and Vps15 form a lipid
kinase complex that engages vesicle nucleation.16 Atg5,
Atg12, and LC3 promote vesicle elongation.17
Cells induce autophagy as a means of survival by
increasing the turnover of intracellular components.18
Under prolonged adverse conditions, progressive cellular
atrophy may lead to type II programmed cell death.18
Whether autophagy promotes cancer cell survival or
produces type II programmed cell death largely
depends on the nature of environmental stress and
cancer cell context.9,10,19-21 Bcl-2 not only plays a negative role in apoptosis, but also inhibits beclin 1-dependent
autophagy.15,22 Therefore, levels of Bcl-2 may influence
autophagy process via beclin 1.
In this report, dasatinib was found to induce significant autophagy, rather than apoptosis, in human ovarian
cancer cells. We have documented the evidence of dasatinib-induced autophagy in ovarian cancer cells both in
vitro and in vivo by several methods.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Antibodies recognizing phospho-Src (Y416), total Src,
and AKT2 were purchased from Upstate-Millipore (Billerica, Mass). p27Kip1 antibody was purchased from BD
Biosciences (San Diego, Calif). Antibodies against p-AktSer473, total AKT, p-mTOR, beclin 1, Atg12, and p62
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
Mass). Anti-LC3 was provided by Drs. N. Mizushima

Dharmacon (Lafayette, Colo) or Ambion (Austin, Tex).
Transfection reagents used were Lipofectamine 2000
from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY) and DharmaFECT
#4 from Dharmacon. Dasatinib (Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Princeton, NJ) was purchased from the Pharmacy Division of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center and dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. A myristoylated AKT1 and AKT2 were provided by Dr. Gordon B.

vector was provided by Dr. Taro Q. P. Uyeda at the
National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and
Technology, Ibaraki, Japan. A reporter construct containing the Bcl-2 promoter (pBcl-2-Luc) was provided by
Dr. Haojie Huang at the University of Minnesota
(Minneapolis, Minn).

Cell Growth Assay
A crystal violet cell growth assay was used to assess anchorage-dependent cell proliferation in 96-well cell culture
microplates as described previously.23 Colony formation
assay was performed in 6-well cell culture plates. SKOv3
and HEY cells (both cell lines have been verified by the Gbanding karyotyping) were seeded at 1000 and 500 cells
per well in triplicate and incubated overnight at 37 C.
Cells were treated with either dimethylsulfoxide or dasatinib (300 nM for SKOv3 cells and 150 nM for HEY cells)
for 14 days. Cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, and
stained with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo) in
methanol. Colonies with >30 cells were counted under
an inverted microscope at low magnification. Growth recovery experiments were carried out in similar conditions
to colony formation assay. Washout experiments were
done by washing the cells with complete media twice and
the cells were refilled with complete media after 72-hour
treatment with dasatinib. Instead of counting the colonies, a microplate reader was used to quantify the cell
numbers.

Establishment of Stable Ovarian
Cancer Subclones
For overexpressing GFP-LC3 and Bcl-2, HEY or SKOv3
cells were cotransfected with pGFP-LC3,24 or pUCCAGGS-Bcl-2,25 and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) by Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stable clones were selected with G418. For
expressing shBECN1, 2 oligonucleotides designed to target the beclin 1 sequence at agaactacaaacgctgttt were synthesized (Sigma Genosys, The Woodlands, Tex),
annealed, and cloned into a piMARK vector.26 The
sequences of the 2 oligonucleotides were: forward, 50 -caccagaattatagacgctgtttacgtgtgctgtccgtaaacagcgtttgtagttcttttt-30 ;
reverse, 50 -gcataaaaagaactacaaacgctgtttacggacagcacacgtaaacagcgtct ataattct-30 . Resultant pishBECN1 construct was
verified by DNA sequencing. Stable clones were selected
with blasticidin.

siRNA and Plasmid Transfection
HEY or SKOv3 cells were seeded on 6-well culture plates
and transfected with control, beclin 1, or Atg12 siRNAs
using the DharmaFECT #4 reagent (Dharmacon). A mixture of siRNA (50 nM final concentration) and transfection reagents were incubated for 20 minutes. Empty
vector pcDNA3.1, or pGFP-LC3, or myristoylated
AKT1 and AKT2 was transfected with Lipofectamine
2000.
Cell Cycle Distribution and Immunoblot
Analysis
Distribution of cells in the sub-G1, G1, S, and G2/M
phases of the cell cycle and Western blot analysis were
measured as described previously.27
Quantitative Reverse-Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis
Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed with an ABI Prism
7900HT Sequence Detection System using SYBR Green
universal PCR master mix (ABI, Foster City, Calif) as
described previously.28 Oligonucleotide sequences of the
primer sets used were: human Bcl-2 (forward, 50 -gggtacgataaccgggagat-30 ; reverse, 50 -ctgaagagctcctccaccac-30 );
human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 50 -cgtcttcaccaccatggaga-30 ; reverse, 50 -cggccatcacgccacagttt-30 ). The melting curves were used to ensure there
was no nonspecific amplification.
Apoptotic Assay
Caspase 3/7 activity was measured after dasatinib treatment with a Caspase-Glo 3/7 kit from Promega (Madison, Wis) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
POLARstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany) was used to determine the luminescent units of
caspase activity.
Luciferase Reporter Assays
HEY cells were seeded on 12-well culture plates in triplicate and first transfected with a reporter construct containing the Bcl-2 promoter (pBcl-2-Luc)29 for 48 hours.
Cells were then treated with dasatinib at different concentrations for another 24 hours. Relative luminescence units
(RLU) were normalized with protein concentrations in
each sample, and final values of RLU were expressed as
RLU per migrogram of protein per milliliter.

HEY Xenografts in Nude Mice
HEY cells (106 in 0.1 mL phosphate-buffered saline
[PBS]) were subcutaneously implanted into the flanks of
4-week-old female athymic nu/nu mice (ERO Animal Facility, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center). Five mice per group were used for each treatment. Once the tumors became palpable (mean size of 0.3
mm3 on Day 4 after inoculation), mice were divided into
2 groups and treated intraperitoneally with either dasatinib (10 mg/kg) or vehicle dimethylsulfoxide 5/week.
Treatment was continued for 21=2 weeks. Tumors were
collected immediately after sacrifice and fixed for electron
microscopy as described below. The tumor volume in
cubic millimeters was calculated as described previously.30
Experiments with nude mice were repeated twice with
similar results. The results are presented as the
mean  standard error for all values. Experiments with
nu/nu mice were reviewed and approved by The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Acridine Orange Staining
Acridine orange (AO) flow cytometry was used to detect
the development of acidic vesicular organelles as described
before, with minor modification.31 Briefly, SKOv3 and
HEY cells were treated with or without dasatinib for 24
hours. Cells were then stained with 0.5 lg/mL AO (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Ore) in complete medium at
37 C for 15 minutes, and examined by flow cytometry
within 2 hours.
Confocal Microscopic Analysis of
GFP-LC3 Spots
HEY subclones that stably expressed GFP-LC3 or cells
that were transiently transfected with pGFP-LC3 were
fixed with 4% formaldehyde after treatment with dasatinib (150 nM) for 24 hours. Cells were then washed with
PBS, mounted, and examined using a confocal microscope (Olympus FluoView 1000, Olympus, Melville,
NY). Digital images were obtained using FluoView 1000
software (Olympus). 200 GFP-LC3 cells that had >10
bright punctate GFP-LC3 spots were counted. The percentage of these cells among dimethylsulfoxide- or dasatinib-treated groups was calculated.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Tissue or cells were fixed overnight at 4 C with a solution
containing 3% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformaldehyde
in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3). Samples were treated

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Src kinase at site 416 (pY416 Src) is critical for its kinase activity.32 Dasatinib profoundly inhibited p-Y416 Src (Fig. 1A). Dasatinib also
inhibited anchorage-dependent cell growth of HEY (Fig.

attained in human plasma (approximately 250-300 nM),
short-term treatment (72 hours) with dasatinib inhibited
growth of HEY cells by 46% (Fig. 1B) and SKOv3 cells

dasatinib significantly suppressed the ability of both HEY

AO is a lysosomotropic agent and is able to stain the acidic
vesicular organelles.31 Although AO staining is not restricted to autophagic vesicles, this technique offers a
rapid and quantitative method to measure induction of
autophagy. Consequently, we have first used the AO
staining and flow cytometric analysis to evaluate dasati-

nib-treated HEY cells for acidic vesicular organelles. As
shown in Figure 2A, dasatinib treatment for 72 hours dramatically increased red fluorescence in HEY cells from
5.1% to 81.0%, indicating the induction of acidic vesicular organelles. Similar results were obtained in SKOv3
cells (Data not shown). The effect of dasatinib on endogenous LC3 protein was checked by Western blot analysis.
As shown in Figure 2B, dasatinib decreased LC3-I protein
and increased LC3-II in both SKOv3 and HEY cells.
Dasatinib concurrently decreased p62 levels (Fig. 2B),
consistently with its correlation with autophagy.14 These
results were further confirmed by GFP-LC3 fluorescence
microscopic analysis. After dasatinib treatment, punctate

whereas diffuse fluorescence of GFP-LC3 in the cytoplasm and the nucleus disappeared (Fig. 2C). Dasatinib
treatment resulted in 57% of HEY cells with punctate
LC3, as opposed to only 8.4% cells with punctuate LC3
in dimethylsulfoxide-treated cells (Fig. 2D). Similar
results were also found in SKOv3 cells (Fig. 2E). Finally,
dasatinib-induced autophagy was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Dasatinib induced a dramatic
increase in autophagosomes (blue arrows) and autophagolysosomes (green arrows) in the cytoplasm of both HEY
cells (Fig. 2F) and SKOv3 cells (Fig. 2G). In contrast,
dimethylsulfoxide-cells exhibited only normal mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum without autophagic
vesicles (Fig. 2F, G). No apoptotic features were found in
dasatinib-treated HEY and SKOv3 cells. Thus, dasatinib
induces typical autophagy in human ovarian cancer cells
in vitro.

To further confirm the ability of dasatinib to induce
autophagy, a HEY ovarian cancer xenograft model in nu/

shown in Figure 3A, treatment with dasatinib at a dose of
10 mg/kg significantly suppressed the growth of HEY
tumors. Ultrastructural analysis of the xenograft tumors
collected at Day 21 showed autophagosomes (blue
arrows) and autophagolysosomes (green arrows) in dasatinib-treated tumors (Fig. 3C), but not in dimethylsulfoxide-treated tumors (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the in vitro
results, electron microscopic examination of xenograft
tumors also showed typical signs of apoptosis such as nuclear condensation and nuclear body in dasatinib-treated
tumors (Fig. 3E, red arrows), but not in dimethylsulfoxide-treated tumors (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate
that dasatinib inhibits ovarian tumor growth and induces
autophagy and apoptosis in vivo.
Beclin 1 and Atg12 are Critical for
Dasatinib-Induced Autophagy
Dasatinib was able to induce p27Kip1-dependent G1
arrest of the cell cycle (Data not shown). p27Kip1 has
been reported to play a role in autophagy induction in
some settings.33,34 Therefore, we sought to test whether
dasatinib-induced autophagy is p27Kip1-dependent.
HEY cells were transiently transfected with siRNA targeted to p27Kip1, control siRNA, or siRNAs targeted to

well-known mediators that are required for autophagy
induction such as beclin 1 and Atg 12. As shown in Figure
4A, knockdown of p27Kip1 with siRNA targeted to
p27Kip11 did not reduce dasatinib-induced autophagy.
Similar results were achieved with a second siRNA targeted to p27Kip12 (data not shown). As expected, downregulation of beclin 1 or Atg12 with respective siRNAs
significantly blocked dasatinib-induced autophagy (Fig.
4A). Effects of siRNA targeted to p27Kip1NA, beclin 1
siRNA, and Atg12 siRNA used in this study on respective
proteins have been demonstrated by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 4B-D). These results indicate that beclin 1 and
Atg12, but not p27Kip1, are critical for dasatinib-induced
autophagy.

Dasatinib-Induced Growth Inhibition Partially
Depends on Autophagy Induction
To determine whether dasatinib-induced autophagy is responsible for growth inhibition in ovarian cancer cells, we
have chosen to down-regulate beclin 1 as a testing model
because it was required in dasatinib-induced autophagy
(Fig. 4A). Beclin 1 siRNA sequences were subcloned into
piMARK small hairpin RNA vector. Two stable sublines
that consistently express reduced beclin 1 levels were
selected (Fig. 4E). As shown in Figure 4F, shBECN #46
and #69 cells were more resistant to dasatinib-induced inhibition of cell growth as compared with piMARK control cells. shBECN #46 and #69 cells had lower
autophagy induction than the piMARK control in

response to dasatinib treatment (Fig. 4G), consistent with
the beclin 1 siRNA data. These results suggest that dasatinib-induced autophagy accounts for dasatinib-induced
growth inhibition in ovarian cancer cells.
Dasatinib-Induced Autophagy Partially
Depends on AKT
To investigate the mechanisms of dasatinib-induced
autophagy, we have studied the effects of dasatinib on
phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR by Western blot
analysis. As shown in Figure 5A, dasatinib treatment
dramatically decreased phosphorylation of AKT and
mTOR in both HEY and SKOv3 cells. To confirm the
value of decreasing AKT in dasatinib-induced autophagy, HEY cells that stably express AKT1 and AKT2
were produced. AKT1 and AKT2 cells were transiently
transfected with GFP-LC3 expression vector, and then

treated with dasatinib for 24 hours. GFP-LC3 punctae
were measured by confocal microscope. Overexpression
of both AKT1 and AKT2 partially attenuates dasatinibinduced LC3 spots (Fig. 5B). This attenuated effect was
associated with decreased inhibition of AKT and
mTOR phosphorylation by dasatinib (Fig. 5C). Effects
of AKT1 and AKT2 overexpression on dasatinibinduced autophagy was further confirmed in SKOv3
cells by using flow cytometric AO staining (Fig. 5D). A
reverse phase protein array analysis was performed to
check the signaling pathways affected by dasatinib.
Results confirmed the inhibitory effects of dasatinib on
p-AKT and p-mTOR, and further showed that downstream targets of AKT and mTOR, p70S6K and S6,
were significantly suppressed (Fig. 5E). Therefore, the
above data indicate that dasatinib-induced autophagy
partially depends on AKT pathway.

Dasatinib Inhibits Bcl-2 Levels and Its
Promoter Activity
Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 binds beclin 1 and inhibits beclin
1-dependent autophagy.15,22,35 Because dasatinibinduced autophagy is beclin 1-dependent (Fig. 4), we
sought to check the effect of dasatinib on Bcl-2 levels.
As shown in Figure 6A, dasatinib markedly suppressed
Bcl-2 protein levels illustrated by Western blot analysis.
Dasatinib also reduced Bcl-2 mRNA level as shown by
quantitative PCR (Fig. 6B), indicating that dasatinibinduced Bcl-2 down-regulation occurred at the level of
transcription. Consistent with this conclusion, dasatinib
decreased Bcl-2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 6C). To further determine the role of Bcl2 down-regulation in dasatinib-induced autophagy,
HEY cells that stably express Bcl-2 were generated (Fig.
6D). As shown in Figure 6E, overexpression of Bcl-2
partially but significantly blocked dasatinib-induced
autophagy in 2 independent sublines that overexpressed
Bcl-2 as demonstrated by AO staining. This result was
further confirmed by GFP-LC3 fluorescence analysis.
As shown in Figure 6F, Bcl-2–overexpressing HEY cells
exhibited fewer LC3 punctate spots induced by dasatinib treatment than control cells, indicating partial

blockade of dasatinib-induced autophagy by Bcl-2
expression. Collectively, these results show that dasatinib-induced autophagy partially depends on Bcl-2.

DISCUSSION
As this report was being prepared for publication, a study
was published showing that dasatinib induces autophagy,
but not G1 arrest or apoptosis, in glioma cells.36 Our
study presented here not only showed dasatinib-induced
autophagy by AO staining and LC3 Western blot analysis,
but also documented it by in vivo study and additional
methods including electron microscopy. Our report has
also revealed several key molecules and pathways such as
beclin 1, AKT, and Bcl-2 that are required for dasatinibinduced autophagy. More importantly, we show that
dasatinib-induced autophagy was functionally required
for dasatinib-induced inhibition of cell growth.
Results shown by Milano indicate that dasatinibinduced autophagy is independent of the cell cycle G1
arrest,36 consistent with our observations that dasatinibinduced autophagy depended on beclin 1 and Atg12, but
not p27Kip1 in ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 4A). However,
there are reports that indicate the role of p27Kip1 in

autophagy.33,34 LKB1-AMPK–dependent phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Thr 198 is reported to increase
p27Kip1 and autophagy induction.34 Our data do not
support the role of p27Kip1 in dasatinib-induced autophagy. Interestingly, knockdown of p27Kip1 seems to somehow increase dasatinib-induced autophagy (Fig. 4A). We
do not know why p27Kip1 depletion enhances dasatinibinduced autophagy in HEY cells. We do know that dasatinib does not increase phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Thr
198 or AMPK phosphorylation (data not shown). If phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Thr 198 is required for
p27Kip1 to induce autophagy, dasatinib-induced p27Kip1
is unable to induce autophagy. Another possibility is that
p27Kip1 is expressed parallel or downstream of Src/Abl kinase inhibition. Src/Abl kinases have been indicated in
directly regulating p27Kip1 expression.37,38 Dasatinibinduced p27Kip1 could result directly from inhibition of
Src/Abl kinases.
Dasatinib can induce both autophagy and apoptosis
in vivo, but only autophagy in vitro in ovarian cancer cells
(Figs. 2 and 3). The mechanism(s) underlying this disparity are unknown. It is possible that in vivo environmental
conditions such as hypoxia, nutrition insufficiency or deprivation, and the immunodefensive system permit dasatinib to induce both type I and type II programmed cell
death. Apoptosis induced in an HEY xenograft model by
dasatinib may result from an autophagy-dependent mechanism. Prolonged and massive induction of autophagy is
known to lead to autophagic cell death.18 Indeed,
Konecny et al reported that dasatinib treatment with
higher dose (1 lM) and longer duration (5 days) induced
significant apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines.39 Resveratrol-induced apoptosis was reported to depend on resveratrol-induced autophagy.40 Therefore, dasatinib-induced
autophagy and apoptosis may be related and contribute to
dasatinib-induced growth inhibition.
Our in vitro and in vivo data showed that dasatinib
induces autophagic cell death that accounts for dasatinibinduced growth inhibition in human ovarian cancer cells.
Beclin 1, AKT, and Bcl-2 are critical mediators of dasatinib-induced autophagy.
