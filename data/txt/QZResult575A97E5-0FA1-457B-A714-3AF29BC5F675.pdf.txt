BACKGROUND: This study assessed attitudes of breast cancer patients toward molecular testing for personalized therapy and
research. METHODS: A questionnaire was given to female breast cancer patients presenting to a cancer center. Associations between
demographic and clinical variables and attitudes toward molecular testing were evaluated. RESULTS: Three hundred eight patients
were approached, and 100 completed the questionnaire (a 32% response rate). Most participants were willing to undergo molecular
testing to assist in the selection of approved drugs (81%) and experimental therapy (59%) if testing was covered by insurance. Most
participants were white (71%). Even if testing was financially covered, nonwhite participants were less willing to undergo molecular
testing for the selection of approved drugs (54% of nonwhites vs 90% of whites, odds ratio [OR] 5 0.13, P 5.0004) or experimental
drugs (35% vs 68%, OR 5 0.26, P 5.0072). Most participants (75%) were willing to undergo a biopsy to guide therapy, and 46% were
willing to undergo research biopsies. Nonwhite participants were less willing to undergo research biopsies (17% vs 55%, OR 5 0.17,
P 5.0033). Most participants wanted to be informed when research results had implications for treatment (91%), new cancer risk
(90%), and other preventable/treatable diseases (87%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients were willing to undergo molecular testing and
minimally invasive procedures to guide approved or experimental therapy. There were significant differences in attitudes toward molecular testing between racial groups; nonwhites were less willing to undergo testing even if the results would guide their own therapy. Novel approaches are needed to prevent disparities in the delivery of genomically informed care and to increase minority

INTRODUCTION
Although the concept of individualizing treatment is more than a century old,1,2 recent advances in molecular diagnostics
have enabled personalized cancer therapy based on molecular characteristics of the patient or tumor and novel molecular
marker–driven clinical trials. Although we know much about factors that influence general participation in biomedical
research, little is known specifically about patients’ willingness to participate in testing for personalized cancer therapy and
their perceptions of participation in biomarker-driven research and targeted therapy trials.3,4 Furthermore, molecular testing brings with it unique problems, such as the potential for the discovery of germline variants or mutations with health
implications for the patient and the patient’s relatives. Little is known about patient wishes for the return of these incidental research results. In this study, we assess breast cancer patients’ attitudes toward molecular testing for personalized therapy and research as well as the return of incidental research results.

institutional review board. Patients registering at the
breast center between October and December 2012 were
invited to participate in a questionnaire study. Eligibility
criteria included (1) being 18 years of age or older, (2)
being female, (3) being fluent in English, and (4) having
been previously diagnosed with breast cancer. Three hundred eight consecutive patients were approached, and 100
completed the questionnaire (a 32% response rate).
Study Instrument

Because of the paucity of existing measures from which
questions specific to this study could be adapted, new measures were developed that were informed by the literature
and previously validated measures4-9 to assess attitudes of
breast cancer patients toward molecular testing for personalized therapy and research. The questionnaire was developed
and reviewed for content validity by a team of investigators
with expertise in genetics, survey research, behavioral science, health communication, and bioinformatics. The questionnaire was pilot-tested on 8 subjects before the main
study. Pilot testing stopped once 2 consecutive subjects
were able to complete the questionnaire without encountering correctable problems. The final questionnaire contained
2 sections (demographic questions and an assessment of
research perceptions) with a total of 20 questions. Items
measured a patient’s socioeconomic status, willingness to be
tested for approved or experimental therapies, willingness to
provide blood and tissue samples for research, preference
on being informed of test results, and willingness to permit
sample DNA banking for future research. With the exception of demographic information, items were measured on
a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The
questionnaire, as administered to the subjects, is available
on request.
Sample Size

This was a descriptive study. The original sample size of
100 was chosen for acceptable precision of the estimates
of means (for continuous variables) and proportions (for
categorical variables) related to patients’ attitudes. Specifically, for a continuous variable, when the sample size is
100, a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for a single
mean will extend 0.196 from the observed mean under
the assumption that the standard deviation is known to be
1 and the CI is based on the large-sample z statistic. For a
binary variable, when the sample size is 100, a 2-sided
95% CI for a single proportion using the large-sample
normal approximation will extend 0.098 from the
observed proportion for an expected proportion of 0.5.
Furthermore, a logistic regression of a binary response
244

variable (Y) on a binary independent variable (X) with a
sample size of 100 observations will achieve 80% power at
a 0.05 significance level to detect an odds ratio (OR) of
3.2 to 4.2, which depends on the baseline probability of
Y 5 1 and the distribution of X.
Data Collection

After informed consent, each patient completed the questionnaire (see online supporting information). Research
staff were available to answer questions and provide clarification on questionnaire items. A standard list of definition of terms was provided to participants. The same list
was also used by researchers as a means of standardizing
responses to questions about specific items in the questionnaire. Participants’ electronic health records also were
reviewed to obtain clinical information relevant to the
study. Data collected from the electronic health record
included the following: participant age, self-reported race,
tumor type and stage, and previous treatment history and
participation in the institutional biobanking protocol at
MD Anderson.
Data Analysis

Our goal in this descriptive study was to preliminarily
assess the association of variables with attitudes toward
molecular testing. We performed univariate logistic regression analyses, and we believe that findings based on these
analyses remain informative toward this goal. Descriptive
statistics were reported as proportions, means, and standard deviations. Univariate tests of association were conducted with Fisher’s exact test or the t test according to
the variable’s distribution. Univariate logistic regression
using the Wald chi-square test was performed to obtain
ORs for answering yes on the questionnaire. Yes was
defined as answering either “strongly agree” or “agree.”
No was defined as answering “neutral,” “disagree,” or
“strongly disagree.” A Bonferroni correction for multiple
testing was used; statistical significance was defined as
P < .01. McNemar’s test was used to compare categorical
responses within patients/groups. Because race was found
to be a primary variable associated with our outcomes of
interest, we also conducted further analyses on this relationship while controlling for relevant covariants. Data
analysis was performed with STATA/SE v12 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX).

white (71.4%), were married (75%), had at least a college
education (55.6%), had children (80%), and were covered by health insurance (98%). Only 37.2% earned less
than $50,000 per year (the US median household income
in 2011).10 Most had early-stage (stage 0-II) breast cancer
(60.6%), had a positive family history of cancer (58.8%),
and had some form of therapy (55.0%) before registration
at MD Anderson.
Patient Attitudes Toward Molecular Testing and
Research Biopsies

Patients were generally willing to undergo molecular testing, biopsies, and blood draws to guide therapy and for
research (Fig. 1A). Patients were more willing to undergo
molecular testing for the selection of approved therapy
versus experimental therapy both if the molecular testing
was covered by insurance (81% vs 59%, P < .0001) and if
the testing cost was not covered (64% vs 37%,
P < .0001). Patients were more willing to undergo molecular testing if the cost of the testing was covered by insurance both to guide approved therapy (81% vs 64%,
P 5 .0004) and to guide experimental therapy (59% vs
37%, P < .0001).
Most participants were willing to undergo blood
draws to guide treatment (88%) and for research (64%,
P < .0001; Fig. 1B). Many also were willing to undergo
biopsies for molecular testing for research (46%) but
more so to guide treatment (75%, P < .0001).
Interestingly, 84 participants (88% of those
responding to the question) stated on the questionnaire
that they were willing to have residual tumor or blood
samples stored for future research, whereas 91 participants
(93%) actually consented to the institutional biospecimen
banking protocol under a separate consenting process.
Given the debate over the return of incidental
research results,11-18 we also asked about patient preferences regarding this issue. Most patients stated that they
would like to be informed about their research results if
these results had implications for therapy (91%), new cancer risk (90%), and other preventable/treatable diseases
(87%).
Association of Demographic and
Clinicopathological Variables With Patient
Attitudes

Next, we assessed whether specific demographic or clinicopathological characteristics were associated with patient
attitudes toward molecular testing (Table 2 and Supporting Table 1 [see online supporting information]) and
patient willingness to have blood draws and research

Even if molecular testing was covered by insurance, more
white respondents than nonwhite respondents were willing to undergo molecular testing for approved therapy
(90% vs 54%, P 5 .0004; Table 3) and for experimental

for education, stage, and history of chemotherapy.19 The
corresponding results are summarized in Table 3. Race
was an independent predictor of preferring not to
undergo molecular testing (though covered by insurance)
for the selection of approved and experimental therapy as
well as tumor biopsies.
In addition, patients with a history of chemotherapy
were more willing to undergo molecular testing for the
selection of experimental medication if it was covered by
insurance; 76% of the patients who received chemotherapy were willing to undergo testing, whereas only 48% of
the patients who did not receive chemotherapy were

DISCUSSION
We found that patients with breast cancer were generally
willing to participate in molecular testing and clinical
research, especially if the results could be used to guide
their care. In addition, patients desired the return of individual research results if these results could affect their
treatment or predict their risk for other diseases. However,
nonwhite patients were less willing to undergo molecular
testing, minimally invasive procedures, or biospecimen
banking in comparison with white patients, even if the
results would guide their own treatment.
Most studies exploring the beliefs, attitudes, and
perceptions regarding participation in genetic research
have been performed outside the United States.10 Many
of these previous studies focused on perceptions of the
general public about the biobanking and storage of tissue
or DNA samples for future research and reported that
most participants had a positive attitude toward biospecimen banking and were willing to donate tissue or DNA
samples to biobanks. A recent survey of the general public
by Kerath et al20 conducted in the northeastern United
States found no association between demographic characteristics, including race and sex, and willingness to participate in genetic research and biobanking.20 Our findings
differ from theirs in that race was a strong and consistent
predictor of a willingness to undergo molecular testing as
well as minimally invasive procedures for testing. However, these findings are consistent with other studies showing lower participation in clinical trials by racial and
ethnic minority groups.21-32
Tumor biopsies and molecular testing are necessary
to select patients who will benefit from specific molecularly targeted therapies. Such testing is also required for

research to discover and validate putative predictors of
response and to determine pharmacodynamic effects of
drugs. Recent studies have demonstrated that research
biopsies can be performed safely with a high rate of successful tissue collection.33,34 With growing interest in
biomarker-driven trials, there has also been a growing
need to determine patient willingness to undergo biopsies
solely for research. In this questionnaire study, most participants stated that they were willing to undergo biopsies
to guide treatment (75%), and 46% were willing to
undergo research-only biopsies. These findings are very
similar to the numbers reported from a questionnaire
study of metastatic breast cancer patients, in which 72%
of the patients expressed a willingness to undergo additional biopsies at the time of a clinically indicated biopsy,
Cancer

and 51% were willing to consider undergoing researchonly biopsies.35 This suggests that the incorporation of
optional or mandatory research biopsies is unlikely to be a
major barrier for enrollment to biomarker-driven trials.
One striking finding in our study was the difference
between white and nonwhite participants with respect to
their attitudes toward personalized therapy and research.
It has been reported that factors associated with a poor
education and a lower income, rather than race, are
greater barriers to clinical trial participation.36 In our
study, income and education were not statistically associated with a willingness to undergo molecular testing or
minimally invasive procedures for testing. In contrast, we
found that nonwhite participants were less willing to
undergo molecular testing or tumor biopsy, even if the

testing was financially covered and was used to guide their
own therapy with approved drugs. There was an even
greater reluctance to undergo molecular testing or tumor
biopsy for research. If widespread, these attitudes are
likely to lead to greater disparities in cancer outcomes
because nonwhite patients with cancer will not benefit
from advances in personalized therapies. Notably, these
findings were not likely caused by responder bias. Indeed,
it seems likely that the nonwhite patients who consented
were likely more favorably disposed toward research and
molecular testing than the patients who did not participate. Further research is needed to identify strategies to
increase minority acceptance of molecular testing and to
uncover barriers for research participation. In addition,
we need to develop methods that will allow us to apply
molecular data to genomically dissimilar populations (ie,
learn from the white population and apply the findings to
the nonwhite population).
More and more, personalized cancer care includes
genomically informed therapy. With multiplex somatic
tumor testing and high-throughput next-generation
sequencing, there is the inherent possibility of unveiling
incidental genomic findings, including other somatic
alterations or germline variants or mutations that may
have therapeutic relevance or may confer a risk of other
cancers or diseases. How to handle such incidental
research findings has been a topic of extensive discussion.37,38 However, many believe that findings with clinical relevance should be confirmed and shared, with
patient preferences about being informed taken into consideration. Indeed, the American College of Medical
248

Genetics and Genomics recently published a policy statement on clinical sequencing, and it recommended that
laboratories that perform clinical sequencing seek and
report mutations of the specified genes.39 In a recent survey of the practices and attitudes of members of the US
genetic research community, 12% of the researchers stated
that they had returned incidental genetic findings, and an
additional 28% planned to do so. A large majority of
researchers (95%) believed that incidental findings for
highly penetrant disorders with immediate medical implications should be offered to research participants.11 Our
questionnaire demonstrates that most participants wanted
to be informed when research results had implications for
treatment (91%), new cancer risk (90%), and other preventable/treatable diseases (87%), and this confirms the
need to genuinely make systematic efforts to identify clinically relevant research findings in a timely fashion and to
develop a mechanism for the return of these incidental
results.
Our study had several limitations. The number of
nonwhite participants in our study was not large enough
to conduct meaningful studies of racial or ethnic subgroups. By enrolling newly registering patients awaiting
their first appointments at the institution, we captured
patients facing new decisions. This timing may have
decreased response rates, and we cannot rule out a sampling bias. However, the demographic makeup, including
the ethnicity distribution of our study population, was
similar to that of new patients registering at our breast
center during the same time period (data not shown). The
questionnaire (see online supporting information) was

Attitudes Toward Molecular Testing/Yusuf et al

framed with the following introductory sentence:
“Personalized therapy is often done by testing tumor and
normal tissue or blood for specific molecular/genetic
abnormalities.” However, it is possibly that the patients
may not have appreciated that the term testing referred to
molecular testing, including genetic testing, and somatic
genomic testing later in the questionnaire. We limited our
study to only female patients, and there may be differences
in attitudes between the sexes. Indeed, in a recent study,
Hong et al35 reported that the willingness to undergo
study-related biopsy was higher in men. Furthermore, we
enrolled only breast cancer patients presenting to an academic cancer center. Participants were relatively well educated, and their income was above the national average;
this reflected the epidemiology of breast cancer and the
patterns of referral to an academic cancer center. Thus,
our findings may not be generalizable to patients with
other diseases or in other care settings (eg, community
practice). However, the focus of our questionnaire was
participation in research and molecular testing for personalized cancer therapy. Thus, we chose to enroll patients
with cancer who were likely to be candidates for personalized therapy in a setting where molecular testing, biospecimen banking, and personalized therapy were likely to be
offered.
In conclusion, most patients are willing to undergo
molecular testing and minimally invasive procedures to
guide approved or experimental therapy. There are significant differences in attitudes toward molecular testing
between racial groups. Novel approaches are needed to
prevent disparities in the delivery of genomically
informed care and to increase minority participation in
research.
