Abstract:

Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is proposed as a critical mechanism for
the acquisition of malignant phenotypes by epithelial cells. In colorectal cancer,
tumor cells having undergone EMT are histologically represented by the presence
of tumor buds defined as single cells or small clusters of de-differentiated tumor
cells at the invasive front. Tumor budding is not a static, histological feature rather
it represents a snap-shot of a dynamic process undertaken by an aggressive tumor
with the potential to disseminate and metastasize. Strong, consistent evidence
shows that tumor budding is a predictor of lymph node metastasis, distant
metastatic disease, local recurrence, worse overall and disease-free survival time
and an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, the International Union against
Cancer (UICC) recognizes tumor budding as a highly relevant, additional prognostic
parameter. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence supporting the
implementation of tumor budding into diagnostic pathology and patient management
and additionally to illustrate its worthiness as a potential therapeutic target.

INTRODUCTION

EPITHELIAL
TRANSITION

Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
proposed as a critical mechanism for the acquisition
of malignant phenotypes by epithelial cells [1]. In
colorectal cancer, tumor cells having undergone EMT
are histologically represented by the presence of tumor
buds defined as single cells or small clusters of dedifferentiated tumor cells at the invasive front [2].
Tumor budding is predictive of lymph node metastasis,
vascular and lymphatic invasion, distant metastasis, local
recurrence and poor disease-specific survival time [315] and classified as an “additional” prognostic factor
by the International Union against Cancer (UICC) [16].
Despite these highly negative attributes, surprisingly little
is known about the events promoting a tumor budding
phenotype although in vitro and xenograft animal models
of EMT may provide the first clues [17-20]. The aim of
this review is to summarize the evidence supporting not
only the integration of tumor budding into daily diagnostic
pathology and clinical management of colorectal cancer
patients but also the targeting of tumor budding as a novel
therapeutic approach for patients with this disease.

MESENCHYMAL

EMT is a biological process allowing a polarized
cell, normally interacting with a basement membrane,
to assume a mesenchymal phenotype characterized by
increased migratory capacity, invasiveness, increased
resistance to apoptosis and increased production of
extracellular matrix (ECM) components [18]. The
completion of EMT is signaled by the degradation of the
basement membrane and formation of a mesenchymal cell.
Highly relevant for embryogenesis and wound healing,
EMT has also been proposed as a critical mechanism for
the acquisition of malignant phenotypes by epithelial cells
[21]. EMT-derived tumor cells occurring at the invasive
tumor front are thought to be those cells entering into
subsequent steps of invasion and metastasis. Moreover,
these cells have been shown to establish secondary
colonies at distant sites that histopathologically resemble
the primary tumor of origin through a process known as
mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) [21].

HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS
TUMOR BUDDING

OF

(PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)
appear to be responsible for the induction or functional
activation in cancer cells of a series of EMT-inducing
transcription factors such as Snail, Slug, ZEB1, Twist,
Goosecoid and FoxC2 [21, 28-31]. Their implementation
into the EMT program may depend on a series of
intracellular signaling networks involving ERK, MAPK,
PI3K, AKT, the SMADs, and integrins [32-34]. The WNT/
Wingless signaling pathway, and its major effectors betacatenin and E-cadherin are however considered integral
components of EMT [21, 28]. Briefly, binding of wnt
proteins to a seven-span-transmembrane receptor frizzled
(frz) leads to activation of WNT signaling and stabilization
of cytoplasmic beta-catenin which can translocate to the
cell membrane or nucleus, by mechanisms including
regulation of cytokines, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs),
TGF-beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and
HGF [35]. Membranous beta-catenin complexes with
E-cadherin, a critical mediator of cell-cell adhesion and
responsible for the maintenance of cell polarity [22].
In contrast, nuclear beta-catenin can function as an
oncogene, binding to Tcf/LEF family members and acting
as a transcriptional activator of downstream target genes
[36]. Hence, membranous expression of both beta-catenin
and E-cadherin characterizes the epithelial phenotype,
whereas loss is indicative of a switch toward a more
mesenchymal one. Up-regulation of proteins involved
in ECM degradation, angiogenesis and migration such
as MMP-7, MMP-26, urokinase plasminogen activator
receptor (uPAR), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), laminin5γ2 -chain, fibronectin and CD44 [22]
have all been reported.

In colorectal cancer, EMT-derived tumor cells are
represented histopathologically by the presence of tumor
buds and are reported to occur in 20-40% of tumours
[22, 23]. Occurring predominantly at the invasive front,
the identification of tumor buds, defined as single cells
or clusters of up to 5 cells can be made using standard
H&E-stained slides or facilitated by using pan-cytokeratin
stains (Figure 1) [2]. In addition, these budding cells
can often be seen in the company of “pseudo-like”
cytoplasmic protrusions in direct contact with adjacent
structures which are thought to be a marker of an activated
budding phenotype associated with cell motility and
increased invasiveness [24]. Histologically, high-grade
tumor budding seems to correlate with certain parameters
[25], most notably with the infiltrating tumor border
configuration defined as widespread dissection of normal
tissue structures with loss of a clear boundary between
tumor and host tissues [23]. On the other hand, tumor
budding occurs significantly less often in tumors with
a more “encapsulating” or pushing/expanding growth
pattern [26], itself frequently, but not always, accompanied
by the presence of dense peritumoral lymphocytic (PTL)
inflammation [27].

ACTIVATION OF THE TUMOR BUDDING
PHENOTYPE
The study of EMT and its related signaling pathways
could provide the first clues regarding the molecular and
genetics events promoting tumor budding in colorectal
cancers. EMT-inducing signals from the tumor-associated
stroma such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal
growth factor (EGF), placental-derived growth factor

2). High-grade tumor budding is often linked to increased
expression of protein markers closely related to ECM
degradation such as uPA and uPAR, matrilysin or MMPs as
well as those often associated with increased proliferation
such as TGF-beta, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), and p53 [37-43]. Markers of cell adhesion and
migration such as E-cadherin or syndecan-1 are decreased
in the center of tumors with high-grade tumor budding in
addition to decreased phospho-AKT, a protein reported
to impact cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis [44-46].
Decreased EphB2 and Bcl-2 have been documented [47].
Interestingly, the number of CD8+ tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) is markedly decreased in high-grade
budders, probably due to the relationship of the immune
response with microsatellite instability (MSI) status [46].
Most interesting is the heterogeneity of expression of
several markers, predominantly related to cell adhesion,
from the tumor centre to the tumor front. Loss of
membranous E-cadherin, CD44, CD44v6, EpCAM and
CD166 expression have all been reported and often are

not expressed within tumor budding cells themselves
[48-51]. The finding of loss of these markers associated
with more aggressive tumor behavior and high-grade
tumor budding may be related to the loss of cell adhesion
function which is represented by membranous staining of
these markers by immunohistochemistry. Several studies
have documented the changes in membranous to more
cytoplasmic expression and dual-functions of proteins
such as E-cadherin, EpCAM and CD44 with tumor
progression, hence caution should therefore be taken to
note the intra-cellular localization of these, and possibly
other cell adhesion molecules [52-54].
Tumor buds themselves shows a strong and uniform
nuclear beta-catenin staining and concomitant loss of
membranous E-cadherin expression, in line with what
is seen in EMT studies [21, 55, 56]. In addition, overexpression of ECM degradation proteins MMP-2 and
MMP-9, uPAR, and laminin5γ2 have all been reported
[41, 57-59]. Additional studies have related tumor budding
to increased expression of putative stem cell markers

TUMOR
BUDDING
MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY

CD133 and ABCG5, as well as of beta-III tubulin, a
protein involved in migration, CXCL12, a stromal cellderived factor involved in chemotaxis and angiogenesis,
hMena, a marker of cell motility and cathepsinB linked
to dedifferentiation [57, 60-63]. Interestingly, ABCG5expressing and non-expressing buds have differential
effects on patient survival supporting the notion that the
level of aggressiveness of tumor buds may depend on
their protein profiles [64]. Despite the clear association of
tumor budding with migration and invasion, paradoxically,
tumor buds seem to undergo low rates of proliferation
as evidenced by reduced expression of proliferation
marker Ki67 and concomitant increased expression of
cell-cycle arrest mediators cyclin D1 and p16 [65, 66].

AND

Whether of sporadic or hereditary origin, tumors
with high-level MSI (MSI-H; 15% of all cases), seem to
have very low rates or no tumor budding [67]. In addition,
in vitro studies comparing microsatellite stable (MSS) and
MSI-H cell lines confirm the reduced EMT in the latter.
Several contributing factors may help explain this finding.

Attacker/Defender Model:
The invasive front of colorectal cancers can be
thought of as a dynamic interface of pro- and anti-tumor
factors. On the one hand, tumor buds promote progression
and dissemination by attempting to penetrate vascular and

Even in cases with no obvious PTL inflammation, the
higher the number of CD8+, FOXp3+ and CD68+ cells
relative to the number of tumor buds (ratio of immune
cells-defenders /tumor budding cells-attackers), the more
favorable the impact on patient survival [72]. MSI-H
cancers are known to metastasize to a much lesser degree
than their MSS counterparts; the abundant immune
reaction at the invasive front and particularly within
the microenvironment of tumor budding cells may help
further to explain this observation.

lymphatic vessels. On the other, the host attempts to fend
off this attack by mounting an immune response composed
primarily of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to protect vascular
and lymphatic channels from invasion by tumor buds [68].
MSI-H colorectal cancers exemplify this attacker/defender
model and highlight a pro-immunogenic phenotype which
may to some extent be responsible for the more favorable
prognosis of patients with these forms of colorectal
cancers [69]. In comparison to MSS tumors, MSI-H
cancers are known to have abundant CD8+ intra-epithelial
and stromal TILs [70, 71]. They are most often found
with pushing tumor borders accompanied by dense PTL
inflammation [71]. It has been previously hypothesized
that specific immune responses contained within this
PTL infiltrate may be targeting tumor budding cells for
destruction, hence their frequent absence at the invasive
front in tumors with strong lymphocytic inflammation
[46]. We recently investigated the composition of the PTL
infiltrate in MSI-H and MSS tumors within the tumor
budding microenvironment [72]. Several differences were
found including a greater number of CD8+, granzymeB+,
CD16+ and CD3+ cells in MSI-H cases. Although the
presence of CD8+ cells among patients with MSI-H
tumors does not seem to influence outcome [73], the
ratio between CD8+, FOXp3+ and CD68+ cells and the
presence of tumor budding has an independent effect on
prognosis in both MSS and MSI-H cancers (Figure 3).

WNT pathway signaling
The Wnt signaling pathway, as seen in EMT
studies in vitro, is believed to be highly relevant to tumor
budding in human colorectal cancer patients. Classically,
chromosomally instable (CIN) or MSS but not MSI-H
tumors may arise from inactivation of Wnt signaling [67].
Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin is typically found in
MSS colorectal cancers, occurs particularly at the invasive
front and within tumor budding cells, and is simultaneously
observed in cases with loss of membranous E-cadherin.
MSI-H colorectal cancers typically do not show mutations
in neither APC, nor present with tumor buds [67, 74].
The frequency of concomitant APC mutation and tumor
budding stratified by MSI status is illustrated in Figure

followed by hereditary MSI-H (Lynch syndrome; Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer) cases, and low-level MSI tumors. Microsatellite
stable (MSS) cancers show the greatest rates of tumor budding, accompanied by frequent APC mutation, thus substantiating the relationship
between Wnt signaling and this histopathological feature.

linked to lymph node metastasis [3-8], distant metastasis
[9], local recurrence [10-15] and correlates with the
distance of tumor invasion beyond the outer border of the
muscularis propria [83]. Tumor budding is proposed as
a useful indicator of isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes
in patients with node-negative colorectal cancers [84]
and could indicate additional laparotomy in patients with
locally excised T1 tumors [85, 86].
The prognostic and independent effect of tumor
budding on outcome has been investigated by several
study groups. High-grade tumor budding has an
independent adverse effect on both overall and diseasefree survival time [23, 84, 87-92] particularly in the
presence of cytoplasmic podia [59] and may serve as an
additional histopathological parameter to identify stage I
or II patients at risk of disease recurrence after curative
surgery [93-96]. Even among patients with node-positive
or stage III disease, tumor budding has been shown to
improve the risk stratification of patients [4, 97]. However,
contradictory findings have been recently reported by Sy
and colleagues who found an association of tumor budding
with worse outcome in univariate but not multivariate
analysis in this subset of patients [98]. Tumor budding
may also be a predictive factor in metastatic colorectal
cancer patients treated with anti-EGFR therapies [99].
In a retrospective cohort of treated metastatic colorectal
cancer patients, high-grade tumor budding could predict
non-response to therapy and in combination with KRAS
mutational status, predicted response in 80% of cases.
The predictive value of tumor budding to targeted therapy
requires further investigation.
In 1989, Morodomi and colleagues published what
appears to be the only work evaluating the presence of
tumor budding within the tumor centre from pre-operative
biopsy specimens [100]. Not only did this type of tumor
budding correlate highly with budding at the invasive
front, but a clear association between increased numbers
of tumor buds in the pre-operative biopsy specimen and
lymphatic and lymph node positivity was observed.
Further studies are warranted to investigate the potential
of this “intra-tumoral” type of budding as a prognostic or
predictive factor in the pre-treatment clinical management
of colorectal cancer patients.

4 [67]. The close relationship between the two features
suggests a strong interaction between inactivation of Wnt
signaling and the presence of tumor budding.

CpG Island Methylator Phenotype
MSI-H colorectal cancers have now been linked to
high-level CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP-H), a
feature itself strongly related to methylation of CDKN2A
(p16) [75]. P16INK4A is known to be a target gene of betacatenin and often the two proteins are co-expressed within
tumor budding cells [76]. Methylation of CDKN2A may
lead to gene silencing and consequently decreased levels
of nuclear p16INK4a protein expression [77]. It is therefore
expected that tumor budding should be significantly
reduced in patients with CIMP-H tumors. Only a handful
of studies to date have evaluated CDKN2A methylation in
the context of tumor budding. Prall and colleagues found
6 cases of high-grade tumor budding with a complete
absence of nuclear p16INK4a protein expression (10.5%)
and all had concomitant p16INK4a methylation [78]. Eleven
methylated cases retained expression of the protein and
interestingly, cases with high-grade tumor budding often
did not stain for nuclear p16INK4a. This lack of concordance
between methylation and protein expression has been also
described previously [79] and may possibly be explained
by the intra-cellular localization of p16. Accumulation
of cytoplasmic, rather than nuclear p16 staining has
been observed within tumor budding cells [67]. Jass and
colleagues hypothesized that the cytoplasmic p16 may
bind cdk4 and block its translocation to the nucleus. In
the absence of cdk4, cyclinD1 may complex with cdk2
thus limiting the availability of cyclins A and E and
inhibiting the cell cycle which could explain the low
levels of proliferation exhibited by budding cells [67,
80]. Although it has been speculated that this change in
intra-cellular localization within tumor buds may be due
to promoter methylation of CDKN2A, the role of p16
in tumor budding in both MSS and MSI-H colorectal
cancers needs further clarification. In addition, it remains
interesting that CIMP-H colorectal cancers, namely those
with the lowest predicted amounts of tumor budding seem
to be most responsive to chemotherapy [81].

Scoring systems

CLINICAL USE OF TUMOR BUDDNIG

Despite the clear associations of tumor budding
with worse clinical outcome and more aggressive tumor
parameters, tumor budding has yet to be implemented into
daily diagnostic routine. The main reason for this is the
absence of standardized scoring systems and sufficient
evidence of inter-observer reproducibility for selected
evaluation methods.
Two different types of scoring systems have been
proposed: subjective and more quantitative/objective. In
1993, Hase and colleagues presented a system based on

Prognostic and predictive impact of tumor
budding
Tumor budding at the invasive front has been
recognized as an adverse parameter and an “additional”
prognostic factor by the International Union against
Cancer (UICC) [16, 82]. High-grade tumor budding,
irrespective of the definition, has been consistently

budding has the potential to be a basis for a supplementary
prognostic scoring system in colorectal cancer once its
evaluation has been standardized. The molecular and
genetic events triggering a tumor budding phenotype,
the changes occurring within tumor budding cells, their
interaction with stromal cells and the identification of
more or less aggressive tumor budding profiles remain
open areas of investigation. Understanding the interactions
between tumor buds and the immune response may be
key toward the development of future immunotherapy
targeting the destruction of tumor budding cells.

the predominant pattern of tumor budding using a 2-tier
method (none or minimal versus moderate or severe)
[87]. Nakamura and colleagues, using a similar system,
described tumor budding along the entire invasive margin
using a 4-tier method (none, mild <1/3, moderate 1/3-2/3
and severe >2/3) [9, 95]. More quantitative scoring systems
have been reported. The group of Ueno and co-workers
proposed 2 methods by counting the number of buds within
the field of most dense tumor budding: (1) using a 20x
objective lens (area 0.785 mm2) and a cut-off of 5 tumor
buds or (2) using a 25x objective lens (area 0.385 mm2)
with a cut-off of 10 tumor buds. Inter-observer agreement
for the latter was reported at kappa=0.84 [23. 101]. Wang
and colleagues presented a technique whereby 5 randomly
selected areas were evaluated, each given a score based on
presence (at least one bud) or absence of tumor budding
in each field (area 0.949 mm2) and document an interobserver agreement of kappa=0.75 [92]. The evaluation of
tumor budding cells can be significantly hindered in cases
of stromal inflammation or fibrosis at the invasive front.
Pan-cytokeratin immunostains facilitate significantly the
visualization of tumor buds and are highly recommended
for their evaluation [2]. Prall and colleagues scored pancytokeratin-stained tumor buds in a 0.785 mm2 field of
vision (250x). Rather than using an arbitrary cut-off
score to classify a case as “budding-positive”, they used
an established statistical cut-point determination method
(receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis)
to identify the “optimal” number of tumor buds to be
used as a threshold value [96]. Classifying tumors of ≥25
buds/field as positive, they report a strong inter-observer
agreement with kappa= 0.874. Also using ROC curve
analysis, our group has shown that with 15 buds/highpower field, the percent concordance between observers
was 88% (kappa=0.6) [99].
These results show the potential for high-level
inter-observer agreement. However, consensus has not
been reached yet and international collaborative efforts
to standardize scoring of tumor budding are crucial
before this feature can be implemented as part of routine
diagnostic pathology.

CONCLUSION
Tumor budding is not a static, histological feature; it
represents a snap-shot of a dynamic process undertaken by
an aggressive tumor with the potential to disseminate and
metastasize. Tumor budding is worth to be therapeutically
targeted; the overwhelming and consistent evidence
demonstrating that tumor budding is linked to unfavorable
tumor-related features, aggressive behavior and worse
overall and disease-free survival time suggests that tumor
budding should be considered an “essential” prognostic
factor along-side pT, pN, pM, lymphatic and vascular
invasion [16]. As seen in breast and prostate cancers
