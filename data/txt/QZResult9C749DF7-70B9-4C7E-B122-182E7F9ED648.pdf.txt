BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the common form of acute leukemia in adults, accounting for over 80% of all acute
leukemias in individuals aged >18 years. Overall 5-year survival remains poor in older AML patients; it is <5% in patients aged >65
years. In this study, the authors examined whether survival has improved for subsets of geriatric AML patients over 3 successive decades. METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data were used to determine trends in relative survival by age
among 19,000 patients with AML over 3 successive decades (1977-1986, 1987-1996, and 1997-2006). Relative survival rates (RRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as measures of survival. RESULTS: Overall, the RRs increased for each successive decade (1977-1986, 1987-1996, and 1997-2006) in patients ages 65 to 74 years, with improvements in 12-month survival from 20%, to 25%,
to 30%, respectively. Findings were similar for 24-month, 36-month, 48-month, and 60-month survival. However, survival rates did not
improve in patients aged 75 years. The oldest old patients (aged 85 years) had the lowest survival rates, with no apparent
improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of a large data set demonstrated that, although overall survival remained unsatisfactory
among older patients, it improved in the younger old (ages 65-74 years). Survival of older old AML patients has not been favorably
impacted by available AML therapies or supportive care, and intervention in this age group is best undertaken on a clinical trial. CanC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the common form of acute leukemia in adults, accounting for approximately 80% of
cases in patients aged >18 years.1 AML is primarily a disease of older adults, and the median age is approximately 70 years
at diagnosis.2,3 The incidence increases from 2 to 3 per 100,000 in young adults to 13 to 15 per 100,000 in the seventh
and eighth decades of life.4
AML in the elderly is characterized by poor treatment outcomes, including low remission rates and short disease-free
and overall survival.5-11 The incidence and severity of comorbid conditions and of functional incapacity increase with age.12
Compromised cardiopulmonary, hepatic, and renal function enhances the toxicity of induction chemotherapy, and functional incapacity decreases the ability to survive life-threatening infections. However, the disappointing outcomes in older
patients are explained not only by age-associated vulnerabilities, but also by adverse disease characteristics associated with
increasing age. These include higher incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosomes 5, 7, or 17 and of complex karyotypes and lower incidence of the cytogenetic changes associated with favorable treatment outcomes.13,14 In addition, there is a higher incidence of secondary AML, including AML with preceding myelodysplastic syndrome and therapyrelated AML, and of multidrug resistance phenotypes.15 Finally, older age precludes allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for most patients. AML in older patients is an escalating clinical problem, because our population is aging.
Our aging population is heterogeneous, and selected older patients survive and benefit from intensive therapy.
Accordingly, recent attention has focused on comprehensive pretreatment assessment in an attempt to define optimal
treatment plans for individual older patients and to generate new evidence that can guide future management. Global performance status assessment, such as the Karnofsky or Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status score, can
help identify patients at the greatest risk for mortality.12 Moreover, other more comprehensive evaluation tools are being
developed.16-18 Novel agents and approaches have been offered to older individuals who cannot tolerate, or are unlikely to

benefit from, intensive chemotherapy because of patientrelated and/or disease factors. Agents currently available or
being studied include the demethylating agents decitabine
and azacitidine, the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide, and the farnesyl transferase inhibitor tipifarnib.19
A systematic review reported that only 25% to 33%
of potentially eligible older patients were enrolled in cancer clinical trials.20 Accordingly, practice guidelines for
older adults often are extrapolated from evidence derived
from the experience of younger participants enrolled in
clinical trials. An assessment of AML survival in the geriatric population in the United States that examines a large
population data set can help determine trends in treatment outcomes. Our study was designed to determine
trends in 12-month, 24-month, 36-month, 48-month,
and 60-month relative survival for patients with AML
aged 65 years over 3 decades (1977-1986, 1987-1996,
and 1997-2006) using representative data from the SEER
registry.21
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Identification

Data were obtained from the 9 original National Cancer
Institute SEER sites, which account for approximately
10% of the US population. The SEER Program started in
1973 to provide cancer statistics in the United States and
is considered one of the most reliable cancer registries in
the world. SEER provides cancer incidence and survival
data from a representative cross-section of the US population. The participating geographic sites include the states
of Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, and Hawaii
and the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Detroit, San Francisco/Oakland, and Seattle/Puget Sound. Since 1973, the
SEER registry has grown through addition of new sites;
however, for the purpose of this study, we restricted the
analysis to include only the original collection sites to
ensure consistency across the 3 decades of interest. The
last complete data available for follow-up are from the
year 2006. Leukemia diagnoses were identified by taxonomy established by the World Health Organization
(WHO) International Classification for Diseases for Oncology. Data include incidence and relative survival for
patients diagnosed with AML, including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), for the periods from 1977 to 1986,
from 1987 to 1996, and from 1997 to 2006.
Statistical Analysis

Incidence and survival data were analyzed using the Surveillance Research Program, National Cancer Institute SEER*
Stat software version 8.0.1 (available at: seer.cancer.gov/
Cancer

seerstat; [accessed October 28, 2011]). Incidence rates were
expressed per 100,000 population and age-adjusted to the
2000 US standard population. Cancer patient survival is
typically measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of
death. Survival can be measured as relative survival, causespecific survival, or observed survival. Cause-specific survival
requires accurate classification of cause of death. According
to standard practice in population-based cancer survival
analysis, period analysis methodology22 was applied to calculate the relative survival rate (RR), which measures mortality because of cancer, capturing both direct and indirect
mortality.23 The RR is calculated as the ratio of the absolute
survival rate of cancer patients divided by the expected survival rate for a group of individuals of the corresponding
age, sex, and race in the general population.24 Comparing
the survival of cancer patients with that of the general population is particularly important when analyzing survival outcomes in the elderly, to eliminate age-specific, competing
causes of death. Because age is a major prognostic factor in
AML, we compared the outcomes in 3 age groups (65-74
years, 75-84 years, and 85 years) for men and women by
analyzing 12-month, 24-month, 36-month, 48-month, and
60-month relative survival. We categorized our age groups
based on the geriatric literature. Geriatricians refer to the
subdivision of the group aged >65 years as the “youngest
old” (ages 65-75 years), the “old” (ages 75-85 years), and
the “oldest old” (ages 85 years), because the examination
of increased frailty and comorbidity seems to be enhanced
using these age cutoffs.25 This report is designed to illustrate
the trends in patient outcomes over time.
The relative survival point estimate with 95% confidence interval 6 standard error (expressed as the percentage) was calculated in SEER*Stat according to standard
statistical methodology with the Elderer II method26
using US sex-specific, age-specific, and race-specific life
tables.27 This method is based on the assumption of independent competing causes of death and estimates the
effect of cancer diagnosis alone on survival. Because virtually all of the excess risk of death in patients with AML
can be attributed to the disease, the hazard ratio and relative excess risk from the disease are close to equivalent.
Thus, relative survival provides a valid approach for analysis in AML. Differences in relative survival between each
calendar period were also calculated. Changes in survival
were considered statistically significant if the P value
was < .05. Recognizing that the age distribution between
age groups was not the same across the 3 decades, relative
survival across the 3 decades would optimally be standardized, but standardized data were not available at the time
of the analysis.

RESULTS
Figure 1 illustrates the numbers of patients diagnosed
with AML over the 3 decades. Overall, 19,272 patients
aged 18 years with a diagnosis of AML who had no previous cancer diagnosis were identified between 1977 and
2006. The group aged 65 years accounted for approximately 53% of cases in the first decade, 55% in the second
decade, and 57% in the last decade, from 1997 to 2006.
Those aged 85 years accounted for about 5% to 10% of
total cases, and the percentage was fairly consistent across
the 3 decades. Figure 2 indicates that the incidence of

AML increased with age. Men had higher incidence rates
than women in all age groups. It is noteworthy that the
frequency of AML diagnosis in the calendar period from
1997 to 2006 may have been impacted by a change in the
WHO definition of AML from 30% to 20% myeloid
blasts in 1998.
Tables 1 and 2 provide data on relative survival and
point estimates in the percentages of men and women
with AML in each of the 3 periods. The tables also compare survival differences between age groups for all
patients, those ages 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, and

85 years. Overall, the RRs increased for each successive
decade (1977-1986, 1987-1996, and 1997-2006) in
patients ages 65 to 74 years, with an improvement in 12month survival from 10.2%, to 20.1%, to 30.3%, respectively, in men and from 14.3%, to 16.3%, to 30.7%,
respectively, in women. The findings were similar for 24month, 36-month, 48-month, and 60-month survival. In
contrast, there was no significant improvement in patients
aged 75 years. When the period from 1977 to 1986 was
compared with the period from 1986 to 1997 or the period from 1996 to 2007 (Table 1), survival in fact
declined in the group aged 85 years for both men and
women. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the trends in overall relative survival for men and women, respectively, in the 3
age groups (ages 65-74 years, 75-84 years, and 85 years)
over the 3 decades. With each year of successive follow-up
up to 5 years, there was a progressive increase in survival
in patients ages 65 to 74 years. An analysis for linear survival trends demonstrated proportional similarity for each
of the age groups in the 3 time cohorts.
DISCUSSION
Over the 3 decades, from 1977 to 2006, overall relative
survival improved during each decade for patients ages 64

to 75 years, but not for those aged 75 years. Thus, there
has been a modest improvement in clinical outcomes for
the “younger old,” but no improvement for the “older
old.”
The roles of patient factors and of cytogenetic and
molecular data in predicting chemotherapy treatment
outcomes in older patients have been analyzed in several
recent studies.28,29 Frohling et al demonstrated that age
and cytogenetic findings are the major determinants of
outcome in patients aged >60 years who receive intensive
chemotherapy.30 Performance status also increases in importance as a predictor of the ability to withstand chemotherapy toxicities as age increases.12
A recent population-based study of patients with
AML from Sweden that examined the years 1973 through
2005 provided a more optimistic interpretation of survival progress, indicating improved survival over time for
all age groups except those aged 80 years.7 In contrast,
another SEER study that compared cohorts from 2000 to
2004 with cohorts from 1980 to 1984 failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival for patients aged >75
years.31 Our report includes 25% more patients and provides data for 3 decades. There appears to be a consensus
about the lack of progress in the treatment of patients

with AML aged 80 years. The benefit demonstrated in
the Swedish study for the cohort ages 71 to 80 years may
reflect improved survival for those ages 71 to 74 years in
that cohort. The great variability in vulnerability and resilience of those in the eighth decade of life makes the agespecific grouping of cohorts somewhat arbitrary, but we
have relied on guidance from the geriatric literature for
our age group selection.
Our data add to a growing literature suggesting the
relevance of subdividing older AML patients into
“younger old” and “older old.” A recent study demonstrated that the presence or absence of mutation of Fmslike tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) in patients with normal
karyotype predicts outcomes up to age 70 years.32 It is
also noteworthy that patients aged 65 years benefit from
anthracycline dose escalation, whereas those aged >65
years do not.33 Kantarjian et al demonstrated that patients
aged 70 years did not benefit from intensive treatment
with cytarabine-based chemotherapy in a study of 446
patients.34 In their study, overall survival remained poor
with the use of intensive chemotherapy, with a median survival of 4.6 months. Worse outcomes were observed for
patients aged 80 years, those with complex karyotypes,
2724

and those with a poor performance status.27 Finally, a
recently published, retrospective SEER-Medicare analysis
by Oral and Weisdorf of 5480 patients who had AML and
a median age of 78 years at diagnosis between 2000 to
2007 demonstrated an improvement in median survival
with treatment among patients ages 65 to 74 years.35
In interpreting our results, several limitations of the
study must be considered. First, the data reflect only
selected SEER areas that provided data over the 3 decades.
They may not be applicable to other geographic locations
that are not part of the SEER registry. Second, SEER data
do not contain detailed information concerning chemotherapy treatments, toxicity profiles, participation in clinical trials, or the magnitude of supportive care for the
geriatric population. Therefore, a potential link between
survival results and type of treatment cannot be assessed.
An additional limitation of this population-based study is
the lack of data on major independent prognostic factors
in older adults, including cytogenetic and molecular profiles, comorbid conditions, and performance status. In
addition, older adults are more likely to have impaired
cognition, poor performance status, and comorbid medical conditions that can limit treatment options; and we

cannot evaluate the effect of those important prognostic
factors on the differences in survival outcome of patients
with AML aged 65 years. Conversely, other than in protocol-driven studies, this information may not be available
for the majority of patients managed in the community.
In addition, patients with APL were included, but APL is
rare in older patients; thus, the inclusion of APL likely
had little impact on our findings. Finally, the data
excluded patients with prior malignancies and, thus,

Figure 4. The trends in 5-year relative survival estimates for
patients with acute myeloid leukemia are illustrated in women
according to 3 age groups (ages 65-74 years, 75-84 years,
and 85 years) in 9 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
Results regions for 3 cohorts from 1977 to 2006 (cohort I,
1977-1986; cohort II, 1987-1996; cohort III, 1997-2006). Note
that improvements in survival were observed for women
ages 65 to 74 years, but no improvements were observed for
women aged >75 years.

excluded therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). In
contrast, all other patients who satisfied SEER requirements for the diagnosis of AML, including those with antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome, were analyzed.
According to the WHO classification, t-MN includes
cases of AML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and MDS/
myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN). It accounts for
approximately 10% to 20% of AML, MDS, and MDS/
MPN.36 The incidence and prevalence of t-AML have been
increasing with aging of the population and improved survival of patients who receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy
for other malignancies. Therapy-related myeloid leukemia is
generally a fatal disease. A study by Schoch et al demonstrated
2725

that the majority of patients with therapy-related acute leukemia (t-AML) had unfavorable cytogenetic findings, but also
that t-AML itself is associated with worse survival outcomes
independent of cytogenetics.377Not including patients with tAML in our study population may have affected the survival
outcomes, although, in a prospective study of 3177 adult
patients with AML, Kayser et al demonstrated that there was
no difference in the cumulative incidence of death between tAML and de novo AML among patients aged >60 years.38
The strength of this study is the large sample size,
representing diverse populations over 3 decades. In addition, population-based registries are a great resource for
the analysis of incidence, mortality rates, and trends. We
provide comprehensive survival data on unselected,
unbiased, untreated and treated older patients with AML.
This background is critical for comparisons with the clinical research literature. Patient and family discussions
before treatment selection should include realistic prognostic information that extends beyond the most optimistic clinical trials.
In conclusion, the results from this large, population-based study over 30 years indicate that the survival of
older adults with AML remains poor, but has improved in
patients up to age 75 years. Improved outcomes in the
younger old group likely are attributable to improved
infection control, better supportive care, and/or improved
methods for studying cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, refining information about diagnosis and prognosis. Patients with AML patients aged >75 years should
be enrolled in innovative clinical trials or should be
offered low-intensity therapies or supportive care. Our
data support the importance of recognizing clinically relevant differences between “younger old” and “older old”
patients.
