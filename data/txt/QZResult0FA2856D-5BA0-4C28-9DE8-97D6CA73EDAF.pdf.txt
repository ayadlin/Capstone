he metabolic syndrome (MetS) was ﬁrst proposed as a clinical
entity by Reaven in 1988 and has been popularized by numerous health organizations as a way of identifying patients at an
increased risk for coronary heart disease or type II diabetes.1,2 The
existence of numerous deﬁnitions for MetS has made it somewhat
difﬁcult for practicing physicians to adopt a standard and then
apply it to behavioral modiﬁcation and/or pharmacologic therapy
for their patients.2 Nevertheless, there is general agreement that
individuals who ﬁt 1 of the deﬁnitions require intervention to
avoid complications. The World Health Organization (WHO) deﬁnition of MetS is shown in Figure 1.
In this issue of Cancer, Smith et al.3 performed a prospective
analysis of some components of MetS in 26 men with locally
advanced or recurrent prostate cancer who were treated with 1 year
of leuprolide in addition to 1 month of bicalutamide at the initiation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy. As
a group, these men had many components of MetS at baseline,
including a mean waist-to-hip ratio of 0.95, a mean triglyceride
level of 213 mg/dL, and an elevated systolic blood pressure of 134
mm Hg. Several of the individuals would appear to have ﬁt the
WHO deﬁnition of MetS, although important data such as fasting
glucose and urinary albumin excretion were missing. During the
study, some key components of MetS such as fat mass, waist circumference, and serum triglycerides were exacerbated by androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT), whereas other parameters such as waistto-hip ratio and blood pressure were unchanged. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased, suggesting a protective effect.
C-reactive protein, a marker of inﬂammation and a controversial
risk factor for cardiovascular disease, was also found to be
unchanged. The authors justiﬁably concluded that GnRH agonist
therapy produces changes in metabolic parameters that do not necessarily increase the risk for the development of MetS, but that the
evaluation of patients for cardiovascular risk factors should be an
important aspect of initiating ADT.3
The last 20 years have seen remarkable changes in both the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Two driving forces have
been the development of prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) testing as
well as the availability of effective pharmacologic interventions to
reduce or eliminate the effects of androgens. With regard to the earlier diagnosis afforded by PSA testing, it is a mixed blessing. Clearly,

we now recognize that although we might save lives
through the screening and effective treatment of discovered disease,4 our interventions come at a high
cost in terms of morbidity to our patients.5 Tannock
stated the dilemma quite clearly in his commentary
entitled ‘‘Eradication of a disease: how we cured
symptomless prostate cancer,’’ published 6 years ago.6
At the other end of the continuum are patients
with locally advanced or metastatic disease who can
now be treated with GnRH analogues, estrogens,
antiandrogens, 5-a reductase inhibitors, or testosterone synthesis inhibitors. These patients represent
the challenge of reaching for a cure at any cost, or of
slowing the progression of metastatic disease. In the
case of curative intent, ADT has been demonstrated
to improve the biochemical disease-free and overall
survival of men with advanced local disease when
added to radiotherapy,7,8 and possibly surgery.9 The
unknowns include the timing and duration of ADT
in this setting and these variables are currently being
intensely studied. In what to our knowledge is 1 of
the most mature studies, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 8610, the ﬁndings to date demonstrate that even a 4-month duration of ADT can
improve disease-free survival without an evident
increase in cardiovascular risk.10 For men with metastatic disease, the situation is less clear and although
meta-analysis of studies performed in the pre-PSA
era did not ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in survival through the use of early versus late
ADT,11 a more recent analysis of trials in the PSA era
suggests that clinical metastases may be delayed in
men with rising PSA after prostatectomy if high-risk
features (eg, Gleason sum 7 or PSA doubling time 12
months) are present.12
However, as shown in the study by Smith et al.,3
ADT comes with its own risks. Bone loss, increased
frailty, diabetes, and excess cardiovascular mortality
have all been reported in numerous large, population-based studies. For example, using the National
Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) registry to identify 22,816 men
diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1992 and

1996, Saigal et al. found a 20% higher risk of a serious cardiovascular event in men who received ADT
for at least 1 year compared with those who did
not.13 These men are reportedly 1.4 times more likely
to develop diabetes14; 21% to 37% more likely to develop bone fractures without antiresorptive therapy15; and are nearly certain to have worsening
frailty, especially in the oldest cohorts.16
The practical implications of these ﬁndings are
clear. Although we have developed easily administered and effective ADT pharmacology, we have been
less successful in our ability to render holistic care.
Patients with painful metastases and early disease
with high-risk features almost certainly beneﬁt from
treatment, whereas the men who enter our ofﬁces
every day with a long list of antihypertensive and
statin medications and who display overt or incipient signs of MetS present a different challenge. These
men are invariably more concerned with their PSA
than they are with their overall health proﬁles. Many
could perhaps even improve their PSA dynamics by
changing their lifestyle rather than by adding ADT to
their pharmacopeias.17 In the process, they would
improve their endurance, avoid many of the complications discussed herein, and maximize their quality
of life (regardless of its duration). As we know, these
changes are much more difﬁcult than taking an
injection or a tablet, yet they ﬁt best with 1 of our
oldest dictums: ‘‘First, do no harm.’’
