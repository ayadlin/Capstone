BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a randomized clinical trial examining the effects of modafinil in
reducing persistent fatigue in patients after treatment for cancer and performed secondary analyses to
assess the effect of modafinil on cognitive function. METHODS: Breast cancer patients who reported a
score of 2 on the Brief Fatigue Inventory were enrolled in the study. In phase 1 (P1), patients received
200 mg modafinil open-label once daily for 4 weeks. In phase 2 (P2), patients with a positive response
after P1 were randomized either to an additional 4 weeks of modafinil or to placebo. Tests of memory and
attention selected from the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerized cognitive assessment were performed at baseline (before modafinil) and after completing phases 1 and 2. The paired differences for each
test score were subjected to a Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Of the 82 women who were enrolled,
76 completed P1, and 68 completed all assessments in the study. Modafinil had a significant effect on the
Speed of Memory (P ¼.0073) and Quality of Episodic Memory (P < .0001) during P1 of the study. After randomization at Week 8, those patients who continued modafinil demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Speed of Memory (P ¼.029), Quality of Episodic Memory (P ¼.0151), and mean Continuity of
Attention (P ¼.0101) relative to the group that was switched to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The authors found
that modafinil improved cognitive performance in breast cancer survivors by enhancing some memory and
attention skills. Although confirmation is needed, these findings suggest that modafinil may enhance qualC 2009 American Cancer Society.

KEY WORDS: modafinil, cognitive function, memory, attention, breast cancer.

After cancer treatment, some breast cancer survivors report cognitive impairment, which has commonly
been attributed to the receipt of chemotherapy and colloquially termed ‘‘chemobrain.’’1 Cognitive deficits
identified by cancer survivors consist of a range of difficulties including memory and concentration problems that can emerge during cancer treatment and continue to have long-term effects for many months
and years after its completion.2-8 Impairment of brain function profoundly affects cognition, psychological
well-being, and the ability to perform the usual activities of daily living.

Changes in cognitive function may be confused with
or confounded by other problems commonly associated
with cancer and its treatment, such as depression, anxiety,
and fatigue caused by sleep deprivation.9-11 Although the
phenomenon is not understood completely, cognitive deficits in cancer patients are assuming greater significance as
cancer survival improves. Advances in basic sciences,
imaging, and clinical sciences are beginning to unravel
pathophysiologic mechanisms that may underlie this
problem.12 Pharmacologic treatment options for cognitive deficits in cancer survivors are borrowed from diverse
diseases, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
and neurodegenerative diseases.13,14 Conventional therapies soon may find new applications; for example, recent
preclinical data suggest that modafinil (Provigil) may have
some cognitive-enhancing abilities, which may positively
affect patients who experience ‘‘chemobrain.’’
Modafinil is a novel wake-promoting agent that is
effective and well tolerated in the treatment of excessive
sleepiness associated with narcolepsy and in persons with
shift-work sleep disorder.15-19 The precise mechanism(s)
through which modafinil promotes wakefulness is
unknown. Modafinil has wake-promoting actions like
those of sympathomimetic agents, including amphetamine and methylphenidate, although the pharmacologic
profile of modafinil is not identical to that of the sympathomimetic amines. The recommended single daily dose
range for narcolepsy is 100-400 mg modafinil. These
doses have wake-promoting efficacy comparable to 2040-mg doses of methylphenidate,20 which has been used
previously in cognitive studies in patients with advanced
cancer.21
We completed a study examining the effect of modafinil on fatigue and sleep complaints in 82 breast cancer
patients after completion of chemotherapy.22 Patients
received 200 mg modafinil once daily for 1 month. Of the
82 women enrolled, 76 completed the study and began
the study medication. A majority, 68 of the 76 women
(90%) who completed the 1-month study, reported
improvement on all 4 measures of fatigue used,23-26 all
P < .001 (Fig. 1). In addition, the Epworth Sleepiness
Scale showed a 22% decrease (P < .01), and the ‘‘disturbed sleep’’ symptom on the symptom inventory27
decreased >45% (P < .01).
Despite these findings, little is known about the
causes of cognitive changes seen during and after cancer

treatment. It seems reasonable to assume that they are
related, at least in part, to other psychological and biological treatment complaints such as fatigue, sleeping problems, and depression.10,28 The nature of the relationships
among these variables, however, both at onset and over
time, remains unclear.
To our knowledge, despite evidence that modafinil
acts as a cognitive enhancer in healthy subjects,29-31 no
study to date has examined the effect of modafinil on a
wide range of cognitive functions using a comprehensive
and well-validated neuropsychological test battery in cancer patients. Therefore, as modafinil was effective in
reducing persistent fatigue in our primary study,22 we
conducted secondary analyses to assess the effect of modafinil on cognitive function and to examine whether modafinil might act as a cognitive enhancer in breast cancer
patients who have completed treatment for cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
General Study Procedures

and 83 years, who had had chemotherapy and/or

radiation treatment at least 1 month previously for an initial diagnosis of cancer, were able to swallow medication,
had a score of 2 or greater on a Brief Fatigue Inventory
(BFI)25 question of ‘‘fatigue worst,’’ and had completed
participation in the primary study ‘‘Modafinil to Treat
Persistent Fatigue in Patients Following Treatment for
Cancer’’22 are included in this secondary analysis. These
patients were approached for the primary study by their
medical oncologist either at a regularly scheduled appointment at the Medical Oncology clinic at the University of
Rochester in Rochester, New York, by telephone, or by a
standardized letter in the mail. It was explained to the
patients that fatigue is a subjective symptom with individual meaning that may be described using a variety of
words and phrases such as ‘‘weak and tired,’’ ‘‘no energy,’’
‘‘can’t get motivated,’’ or ‘‘trouble breathing.’’32 The
patient then completed question 3 of the BFI. If the
patient responded to question 3 of the BFI with an answer
of 2, the patient was invited to participate in the study;
however, if the patient responded with an answer of 1, the
patient was considered ineligible for the study. The University of Rochester Research Subjects Review Board
approved the primary study, and all patients provided
written informed consent.
In phase 1 of the study, patients received 1 tablet of
100 mg of modafinil once a day for the first 3 days and
then 2 tablets (200 mg) open-label once daily for 4 weeks.
In phase 2, patients with a positive response after phase 1
were randomized either to an additional 4 weeks of modafinil (200 mg) or to placebo. Tests of memory and attention
selected from the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerized cognitive assessment were performed at baseline
(before modafinil) and after completing phases 1 and 2.
Potential research subjects were excluded if they had
taken modafinil previously, had taken a psychostimulant
or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within the past 30 days,
or were currently taking an anticoagulant, a-interferon,
interleukin-2, or a corticosteroid. Individuals with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease, uncontrolled
hypertension, alcohol or drug abuse, severe headaches,
glaucoma, seizure disorder, narcolepsy, psychotic disorder, or uncontrolled Tourette syndrome were also
excluded. If a steroidal contraceptive was being used for
fertility control, participants had to agree to use a barrier
method of contraception during the study and for 1 full
menstrual cycle after the study.

Randomization
After 4 weeks of open-label modafinil, patients who met
the eligibility criteria were randomized to 1 of 2 trial arms
by means of randomly ordered sealed envelopes. Participants were stratified by treatment regimen (completed
chemotherapy alone or radiation alone or chemotherapy
plus radiation) and were assigned either to continue
200 mg modafinil orally once each day or to switch to a
matching placebo orally once each day.

Assessments
The CDR system was used to assess major domains of
attention and memory. The CDR system is designed to
provide the drug development process with a stable, practical, validated, and sensitive platform to enable important
cognitive and behavioral effects of medicines to be captured
and evaluated. Its validity, test-retest reliability, and sensitivity have been demonstrated in several populations.33-36
The CDR system comprises both custom-built tests
(eg, digit vigilance, spatial working memory) and tests
whose general methodology is widely known (simple and
choice reaction time, word recall). All tests have been
standardized, extensively validated, and implemented
with a software and hardware platform that enables
responses to be recorded with true millisecond accuracy.
The system has been used worldwide since 1984 in
over 500 clinical trials. Data from the system have been
the subject of over 100 peer-reviewed papers, more than
20 book chapters, and 300 published abstracts.37 An
advantage of the CDR system is that many of the tests
used are generic and generally accepted for use in psychopharmacology research. Furthermore, because it has been
used in hundreds of studies, extensive normative data exists
from populations ranging in age from 12 to 90 years.
In recent years, CDR has identified major factors
reflecting distinct and important dimensions of human
cognitive function. The measures that contribute to these
factors are combined to produce factor scores. These factor scores are unique to the CDR system, and thus the
CDR offers a highly sensitive way of assessing broad but
distinct aspects of cognitive function.
The sensitivity and reliability of these tests for detecting
cognitive impairment in a variety of clinical conditions (eg,
normal aging, depression, poststroke, schizophrenia, and

Statistical Analysis
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of modafinil in alleviating cognitive impairment in
cancer patients after completion of cancer therapy. Power
calculations demonstrated that with our sample size of 34
subjects in each group, we would be able to detect an
effect size of 0.62 standard deviations, using a 2-sided P
value of <.05 for statistical significance. If the standard
deviation of the change score was 1, then the difference of
change score detected was 0.62; if the standard deviation
was 2, then the difference detected was 2  0.62, with a
power of 0.939. The primary independent variable was
treatment group, and the dependent variable was the
change in scores after randomization (Week 4 to Week 8).
The primary outcome measures chosen for these comparisons were the change in the factor scores of Speed of
Memory and Continuity of Attention, with the rationale
that those patients who experience ‘‘chemobrain,’’ self2608

and to investigate whether these outcomes may prove sensitive to modafinil. Differences in assessment scores using
paired samples from baseline (Week 0) to randomization
(Week 4) and baseline to post-treatment (Week 8) were
also compared across the entire study sample. If the distribution of the differences between pairs was non-normally
distributed, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to
assess the change within each treatment group. All statistical tests were 2-sided and performed at the 5% level of significance. Data analysis was performed using SAS
software version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Subject Characteristics
Of the 82 eligible patients, 6 dropped out before completing the open-label phase; 2 complaining of anxiety, 2
reporting headaches, and 1 reporting nausea dropped out
during the first week (all were very slight with weights
<49.5 kg), and a final patient found herself unexpectedly
pregnant midway through the study and was withdrawn
(Fig. 2). The characteristics of the 6 participants who did
not complete all assessments during randomization were
very similar to those who did complete the study. The
6 patients were white, and most had received some college

Upon assessment at Week 4, an additional 8 patients
failed to meet the eligibility criteria to continue onto the

no improvement in fatigue during the open-label phase.

descriptive data for both the open-label phase and drug
and placebo groups after randomization are shown in Table 2.
The connection between aging and cancer is significant; >60% of all cancers occur among those >65 years
old. There is little information regarding the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on the older patient’s cognitive abilities and whether the chemotherapy affects the patient’s
ability to maintain functional independence.53 The modafinil group mean age was 5 years younger than the placebo group in this analysis; however, independent t test
revealed no statistically significant differences in age
(P ¼ .066), education (P ¼ .921), or occupation
(P ¼ .182) between the 2 randomized groups modafinil
(n ¼ 34) and placebo (n ¼ 34). Finally, we examined differences in fatigue and depression between the groups. In
previous research, both fatigue and depression have demonstrated a potential to affect cognitive performance.

Randomization (drug vs placebo,

Randomization did not have a significant effect on
each outcome measure of any 1-factor score. However,
modafinil demonstrated a cumulative improvement from
baseline to Week 8 in composite Speed of Memory scores
(P ¼ .029) compared with placebo (P ¼ .116), and for
composite Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory, the
scores in the drug group show significant change

Improvement was observed at the Week 4 visit and was
maintained throughout the study.
About 70% of the subjects in the active drug group
had an improvement in Continuity of Attention from
baseline to post-treatment (Week 8), compared with 52%
in the placebo group, but the difference was not significant (P ¼ .19). The active drug produced a better
response, an improvement over the Week 4 assessment,
where no significant effect was seen (Fig. 4). At the final

the 68 patients who completed all 3 CDR assessments.
Although this reduction in patient numbers may have
resulted in a biased subsample, it should be remembered
that patients were not randomized if they failed to
respond to open-label modafinil in terms of the primary
outcome of the original study—ie, fatigue, not cognitive
improvement. Furthermore, as Table 1 demonstrates, the
68 completers did not appear to differ from the 76 individuals who had no side effects, and the purpose of this
secondary analysis is to determine whether sufficient evidence indicates that modafinil improves cognitive function to support further trials to demonstrate this result
more conclusively. For a future study, we propose a longitudinal design whereby patients are recruited before
chemotherapy and randomized to modafinil or placebo,
and cognitive performance is evaluated before chemotherapy and again 3 and 6 months postchemotherapy. This
strategy would directly establish the presence of cognitive
deficits related to chemotherapy and determine whether
modafinil alleviated those deficits.

There was no significant effect of modafinil on
Quality of Working Memory or Power of Attention during the randomization phase.

Study Limitations
This secondary analysis has some limitations. The patients
in this study tended to be more educated than the general
population and were primarily Caucasian, making these
results less generalizable to patients from minority groups
or those of lower socioeconomic status. In addition, the
original study recruited 82 breast cancer patients, but for
the purpose of this study, we have only analyzed data from
2612

Modafinil is a wakefulness- and alertness-enhancing agent
currently approved for treatment of excessive daytime
sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep
apnea/hypopnea syndrome, and shift-work sleep disorder.
Modafinil belongs to a class of drugs called eugeroics
(meaning ‘‘good arousal’’). Its uniqueness lies in its ability
to only ‘‘stimulate when stimulation is required.’’54 As a
result, the ‘‘highs and lows’’ associated with other stimulants, such as amphetamine, are absent with eugeroics.
Modafinil appears to produce its effects via different neural mechanisms than conventional stimulants or other
psychotropic drugs with similar effects on wakefulness
and alertness, and it does not seem to stimulate dopamine
transmission in the brain or produce sympathomimetic
effects. Although the precise mechanism of action of modafinil is unknown, numerous human and animal studies
have elucidated many of its characteristics. Modafinil has
site-specific central nervous system activity55,56 and acts
on a specific subset of brain pathways that regulate sleep
and wakefulness. However, it does not bind to many
receptors that are normally involved in sleep/wake regulation, including those for norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and c-aminobutyric acid. It does not have the

effects on the extrapyramidal motor system—restlessness,
hyperactivity, and irritability—that conventional stimulants exhibit, suggesting that modafinil has the potential
to act as a cognitive enhancer without the side effects produced by other stimulants.
This study of modafinil, the first to examine cognitive function in patients after treatment for cancer, has
demonstrated that 200 mg of modafinil enhances Speed
of Memory, making patients both more accurate and
faster at retrieving information. Although modafinil had
no significant effect at Week 4 on Continuity of Attention, those participants who continued modafinil showed
an improvement at Week 8. Significant improvement was
also seen in the Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory,
indicating that patients treated with modafinil were better
able to store, retain, and retrieve both verbal and pictorial
information. Modafinil was thus able to improve cognitive performance (memory and attention) in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer survivors.
Most of the effects of modafinil on the composite
score of memory and some measures in attention were
shown in the first postbaseline visit (Week 4), were sustained throughout the study, and are similar to those previously noted in clinical studies of modafinil in other

populations.15-17,57 The findings of this study demonstrate that the duration of an open-label drug is an important factor that needs to be addressed when considering a
pharmacological intervention for a symptom. By commencing all our patients on 200 mg daily of modafinil
and then dividing them into 2 groups, where 1 group continued the medication and the other started taking an
identical placebo, we were able to compare 4 weeks of
modafinil treatment with 8 weeks.
Quality of life, as well as survival and potential for
cure, is of paramount importance to cancer patients.
Post-treatment survivorship issues have become a prominent concern in cancer survivors and patients living with
cancer. Cancer therapy-related cognitive decline, along
with fatigue, anxiety, and depression, is 1 of the most
common symptoms affecting quality of life.58,59 During
the past decade, studies have been performed to define
this treatment-related cognitive decline and to study its
prevalence and importance. Unfortunately, the precise
etiology remains obscure for most patients with this
debilitating side effect. A better molecular understanding of this cognitive dysfunction will likely lead to the
identification of therapeutic targets and ultimately better
treatment.

Although larger studies are needed to confirm these
findings, the results of our secondary analysis of a trial of
modafinil suggest that it can considerably improve some
cognitive function measures in breast cancer survivors.
