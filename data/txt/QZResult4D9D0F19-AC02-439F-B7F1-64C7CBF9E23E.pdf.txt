BACKGROUND: Aberrant Notch activation confers a proliferative advantage to many human tumors, including melanoma. This phase
2 trial assessed the antitumor activity of RO4929097, a gamma-secretase inhibitor of Notch signaling, with respect to the
progression-free and overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic
melanoma of cutaneous or unknown origin were treated orally with RO4929097 at a dose of 20 mg daily 3 consecutive days per
week. A 2-step accrual design was used with an interim analysis of the first 32 patients and with continuation of enrollment if 4 or
more of the 32 patients responded. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients from 23 institutions were enrolled; 32 patients were evaluable.
RO4929097 was well tolerated, and most toxicities were grade 1 or 2. The most common toxicities were nausea (53%), fatigue (41%),
and anemia (22%). There was 1 confirmed partial response lasting 7 months, and there were 8 patients with stable disease lasting at
least through week 12, with 1 of these continuing for 31 months. The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 9% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 2%-22%), and the 1-year overall survival rate was 50% (95% CI, 32%-66%). Peripheral blood T-cell assays showed no significant inhibition of the production of interleukin-2, a surrogate pharmacodynamic marker of Notch inhibition, and this suggested
that the drug levels were insufficient to achieve Notch target inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: RO4929097 showed minimal clinical activity
against metastatic melanoma in this phase 2 trial, possibly because of inadequate exposure to therapeutic drug levels. Although
Notch inhibition remains a compelling target in melanoma, the results do not support further investigation of RO4929097 with this

INTRODUCTION
The Notch pathway is a highly conserved signaling cascade that plays an essential role in the normal development of a variety of human tissues through the regulation of gene expression that controls stem cell homeostasis and differentiation, cell
survival, and apoptosis.1 In oncogenesis, dysregulation of the Notch pathway confers to many human tumors a proliferative advantage, resistance to apoptosis, and the ability to maintain a stem cell–like phenotype.2,3
The role of aberrant Notch signaling in melanoma has garnered a great deal of interest in recent years. Melanoma is a
particularly aggressive cancer with the ability to metastasize at a relatively small primary tumor size. Two well-established
steps of melanoma invasion and metastasis include the loss of cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and the acquisition of
melanoma cell adhesion molecule.4,5 Multiple groups have demonstrated that amplified Notch signaling contributes to
melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo and promotes a more aggressive phenotype, at least in part by inhibiting E-cadherin
expression and upregulating melanoma cell adhesion molecule.6-9
Notch signaling relies on the intramembrane cleavage of the Notch receptor by a gamma-secretase complex to release
a Notch intracellular domain that translocates to the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes, including hairy/
enhancer of split related with YRPW motif protein 1 (Hey1) and hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), involved in cell fate

determination, tissue differentiation, and vasculogenesis.
The understanding of this pathway has fueled the investigation of gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) as a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting Notch signaling in melanoma as
well as other cancers.
In addition to a role for Notch signaling in melanoma progression, the Notch pathway has also been
shown to be critical for normal T-cell development and
function.10,11 Therefore, because of the importance of
T-cell immunity in the control of melanoma in particular,
it is critical to assess the effects of these agents on T-cell
function in patients as pharmacologic strategies for Notch
inhibition in cancer therapy are developed. An analysis of
the effects on T cells, with the production of interleukin-2
(IL-2), a potent T-cell growth factor, used as a measure of
T-cell function, could also serve as an indirect pharmacodynamic biomarker of Notch inhibition.12
RO4929097 is a small-molecule inhibitor of
gamma-secretase with high oral bioavailability and is a
potent and selective inhibitor of gamma-secretase: it leads
to the blockade of Notch signaling in tumor cells. A phase
1 dose-escalation study in 110 patients with refractory
metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors demonstrated
that RO4929097 was well tolerated, with the majority
(95%) of toxicities being grade 1 or 2 fatigue and mucocutaneous effects.13 Most toxicities, including all that were
considered dose-limiting, were more common with a 7days-on/14-days-off schedule versus a 3-days-on/4-daysoff schedule for 2 of 3 weeks. Antitumor activity was seen
in 26 of the 96 evaluable patients (27%), with 1 partial
response from a colonic adeno/neuroendocrine tumor, 1
mixed response from an epithelioid sarcoma, and 1 minor
response and 1 nearly complete positron emission tomography response from cutaneous metastases of melanoma;
the other 22 patients had stable disease for at least 3 to 6
months (most frequently melanoma, sarcoma, and ovarian carcinoma). The clinical outcomes of this phase 1 trial
provided the rationale for continuing the investigation of
RO4929097 in patients with metastatic melanoma on the
3-days-on/4-days-off schedule with a 20-mg dose level,
which demonstrated less auto-induction of drug metabolism and potential for drug-drug interactions than the
other dose and schedule. We, therefore, conducted a
phase 2 clinical trial of RO4929097 in 32 patients with
metastatic melanoma. The study objectives were to assess
the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) and the 1year overall survival (OS) in advanced treatment–naive
melanoma patients with pooled data from a well-accepted
advanced melanoma meta-analysis to set the levels of activity that would support further study of this regimen.

We also wished to further assess the safety and tolerability
of the regimen and to evaluate the effects of the study
drug on T-cell function and Notch target genes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The trial was performed by the Southwest Oncology
Group (SWOG), and the investigational agent was provided by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program of the
National Cancer Institute under an agreement with
Roche/Genentech
(ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier
NCT01120275). All study subjects provided voluntary,
written informed consent through a document approved
by the institutions’ human subject protection committee.
The protocol and all amendments were also approved by
SWOG and by the regulatory committees at the participating institutions.
Patient Selection

Eligible patients had histologically confirmed stage IV
melanoma of cutaneous or unknown origin (ocular and
mucosal origins excluded) with measurable disease as
defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
1.1. Study subjects were not preselected for the expression
of known oncogenic pathways or for any marker of Notch
pathway activation; however, patients were required to
have archival or fresh tissue available from before the
study for laboratory correlates. Patients must have had no
prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for stage IV disease (prior
immunotherapy and adjuvant therapy were allowed) and
no history of central nervous system metastasis. They were
required to have a Zubrod performance status of 0 to 1
and adequate hematologic, hepatic, cardiac, and renal
function with a leukocyte count  3000/lL, an absolute
neutrophil count  1500/lL, a platelet count  100,000/
lL, a hemoglobin level  9 g/dL, a creatinine clearance 
60 mL/min, a total bilirubin level  the institutional
upper limit of normal, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels  2.5 times the institutional
upper limit of normal, and a QTcF  500 milliseconds.
Women of childbearing potential were required to have a
negative serum pregnancy test, and subjects of both sexes
were required to practice adequate birth control during
protocol participation.
Treatment and Monitoring

The study drug RO4929097 was given orally on an empty
stomach at 20 mg daily on days 1 to 3, 8 to 10, and 15 to
17 of every 3-week cycle of therapy. This was the recommended phase 2 dose based on the phase 1 dose escalation
study. Treatment was given on a continuous schedule
433

Original Article

with dose adjustments and brief breaks from therapy
specified in the protocol for treatment-related toxicities.
Drug compliance was recorded by patients on an intake
calendar that was submitted to the research team, along
with all unused tablets, at each study visit. Before dispensing RO4929097, the investigator confirmed and documented the patient’s use of 2 contraceptive methods and
dates of negative pregnancy tests and confirmed the
patient’s understanding of the teratogenic potential of the
study drug. Patients were removed from the study for disease progression, symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, or a treatment delay > 14 days for any
reason or at the patient’s request.
Additional patient consent (optional) was requested
for fresh tumor samples before the study (if the patient
had not already undergone a prestudy biopsy) and at week
3 of cycle 1. The tumor tissue could be obtained by surgical excision, surgical core biopsy, or computed tomography–guided core biopsy.
Patients were evaluated with a history, physical, laboratory analyses (complete blood count, metabolic panel,
pregnancy test, and thyroid-stimulating hormone), electrocardiogram, toxicity assessment, and drug compliance
assessment at least every 3 weeks at the beginning of each
cycle. Imaging studies for disease assessment were performed before the study, at week 7, at week 13, and then
as clinically indicated until progression. Specific guidance
for dose modifications was provided for the management
of hematologic toxicities, hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities, diarrhea, and other nonhematologic toxicities.
Statistical Methods

The primary objectives of this phase 2 trial were to assess
6-month PFS and 1-year OS with historical benchmarks
established by a large meta-analysis of phase 2 cooperative
group clinical trials by Korn et al.14 Our objective was to
distinguish between true 6-month PFS probabilities of
<15% and >30% and true 1-year OS probabilities of
<35% and >50%. The results of this study would be
considered evidence that this agent warranted further
study if at least 17 of 72 eligible patients survived and
were progression-free for at least 6 months or if 31 or
more eligible patients survived at least 1 year. A 2-step
accrual design was used, and this required an interim analysis of the first 32 patients evaluable for a response. The
criterion for the continuation of enrollment to 72 patients
would be the observation of 4 or more clinical responses
in the first 32 patients or the observation that 9 or more of
the first 32 patients evaluable for 6-month PFS were alive
and progression-free at that milestone. An objective
434

response was used in lieu of the primary study objectives
of PFS and OS as a criterion for trial continuation because
the prolonged time to reach the PFS and OS endpoints
would have obviated their utility as interim checkpoints
for this actively accruing trial. The secondary objectives
were to investigate the relationship between the Notch
activation status, the Notch target gene expression in the
tumor, and the clinical outcome; to study the effects of
the drug on T-cell function; to assess the objective
response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR),
which was defined as the number of patients with a best
response of stable disease or better 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy; and to assess toxicity. PFS and OS estimates were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method.15
Confidence intervals (CIs) for the medians were constructed with the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley,16
and CIs for point estimates (eg, 6-month PFS) were calculated with a log-log transformation. Clopper-Pearson CIs
were calculated for binary outcomes (eg, ORR). An exploratory analysis of the relationship between biomarker
values and clinical outcomes was performed. The biomarker values were treated in 2 ways: first as continuous
variables with a log transformation if the values were
skewed and then by dichotomization at the observed median. Cox regression was used to analyze the relationship
of the biomarker values with PFS and OS. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationships with ORR and
DCR. Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate the dichotomized variables. To explore the relationship between
the change in T-cell IL-2 production values from the
baseline to week 3 and OS and PFS, a landmark analysis
was performed, with OS and PFS beginning to be measured in week 3. All analyses were performed with SAS
version 9.2.
Laboratory Correlates

The secondary objectives of this study included the evaluation of Notch1 by immunohistochemistry and real-time
reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) for Hey1 and Hes1 in pretreatment patient samples
(and on-treatment samples, if available) and the exploration of potential indicators of Notch activity in ontreatment biopsies and their association with a clinical
response to the study drug. Immunohistochemistry was
performed on pretreatment paraffin tissue. The sections
were prepared at SWOG and shipped to the University of
Chicago for analysis. The slides were stained with antibodies specific for total Notch1 (#sc-6014, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) versus a secondary antibody alone. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed in parallel.

Semiquantitative scoring was used to determine the
immunohistochemistry results, which were manually
evaluated and scored as negative, 1, 11, or 111 by a
pathologist. For quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was
extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
slides with an RNeasy FFPE kit (#74404, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Complementary
DNAs were prepared with a high-capacity complementary DNA reverse transcription kit (#4368814, Applied
Biosystems). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with
primer/probe sets specific for Hey1 (Hs01114113_m1,
Applied Biosystems) and Hes1 (Hs00172878_m1,
Applied Biosystems). Human b-actin (4352935E_
3614263566, Life Technologies Corp) was used as an internal standard.
The effect of the study drug on T-cell function was
also investigated through the evaluation of IL-2 production via pretreatment and on-treatment patient peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with the
superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA). This
assay also served as a pharmacodynamic biomarker. Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, counted, and resuspended at 1 3 106/mL in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s
medium and then seeded at 100,000 PBMCs per well in a
Cancer

February 1, 2015

96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plate. Cells were treated
with the medium alone, the superantigen SEA at 100 ng/
mL, or SEA (100 ng/mL) plus a nonclinical GSI (InSolution c-Secretase Inhibitor X, #565771, Calbiochem;
10 lM) for 24 hours. IL-2 levels in the supernatant were
measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Thirty-six patients from 23 SWOG institutions were registered for the first stage of this study between January
2011 and November 2011. The study was then closed after not enough activity was shown to warrant opening the
second stage of accrual. Three patients were ineligible: 2
had no measurable disease at the baseline per the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and 1 had inadequate renal function. In addition, 1 eligible patient, after
giving initial consent, refused the protocol treatment. For
the 32 evaluable patients, the median age was 60.9 years
(range, 32.8–85.9 years), 69% were male, and 41% had
a serum lactate dehydrogenase level greater than the institutional upper limit of normal. The sites of metastases
were node/soft tissue/skin (53%), lungs (53%), liver
(38%), and bone (25%). Nine patients (28%) received
prior systemic therapies, including adjuvant interferon
a (16%), IL-2 (6%), denileukin diftitox (3%), and sargramostim (3%). Mutational testing was not required for
enrollment, and the BRAF mutation status of the study
patients was not recorded. The patient characteristics are
listed in Table 1.
Toxicities

The majority of the toxicities attributed to RO4929097
were grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse events
(across all grades) were nausea (53%), fatigue (41%), anemia (22%), anorexia (19%), headache (13%), constipation (13%), and diarrhea (13%). Six patients experienced
grade 3 events (see Table 2). There were no grade 4 or 5
toxicities.
Clinical Responses

A 2-stage accrual design was applied as detailed previously, and after the accrual of the first 32 evaluable
patients, the clinical outcomes did not meet the criteria
for the accrual of additional patients. There was 1 confirmed partial response lasting 7 months (ORR, 3%; 95%
CI, 0%-16%); this patient was taken off the protocol therapy for progression at 10 months but remained alive at
281 months after protocol entry. Eight additional
patients had stable disease lasting at least through the

ease progression. This patient had not received any additional therapy other than the study drug. This patient and
the 1 patient with a partial response both received adjuvant interferon a as their only prior systemic treatment.
The DCR at 12 weeks was 31% (95% CI, 16%50%). The median PFS was 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.3-2.6
months), and the median OS was 13 months (95% CI, 820 months). With the model proposed by Korn et al,14 predicted values for 6-month PFS and 1-year OS were calculated on the basis of the observed distributions of sex,
performance status, and visceral metastases. A 1-sided exact
binomial test was used to test the hypothesis that the
observed 6-month PFS, 1-year OS, or both were superior
to these predicted values. The 6-month PFS was 9% (95%
CI, 2%-22%), which was not superior to the predicted
value of 17% (P 5 .91). The 1-year OS was 50% (95% CI,
32%-66%), which was not superior to the predicted value
of 44% (P 5 .32). The Kaplan-Meier estimates for PFS
and OS are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

Among these patients with stable disease, 1 patient with

Notch pathway inhibition has been shown to inhibit
T-cell function in vitro,17 and Notch signaling is required
for T-cell development.18,19 Therefore, we analyzed the
effects of RO4929097 administration on the activation of
peripheral T cells to assess both the potential impact on
immune function and the potential as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for drug effect. Cryopreserved PBMC
preparations were available from 23 patients. The production of IL-2 was evaluated in response to the polyclonal
T-cell stimulus provided by SEA before the study and
during week 3 on treatment. However, no significant difference was observed with this ex vivo assay. In contrast,
all patients showed inhibition of T-cell cytokine production when a nonclinical GSI was included during the in
vitro stimulation (Fig. 3). Therefore, these data suggest
that the Notch pathway was likely not adequately inhibited in week 3 of the administration of RO4929097 in
treated patients. We investigated in a preliminary manner
the relationship between clinical outcomes and baseline
IL-2 levels as well as the change in IL-2 levels at week 3 in
20 eligible patients. There was no significant association
found between baseline IL-2 levels and PFS (P 5 .21), OS
(P 5 .58), ORR (P 5 .74), or DCR. (P 5 .51) or between
the change at week 3 and PFS (P 5 .48), OS (P 5 .88),
ORR (P 5 .23), or DCR (P 5 .64). However, the
1 patient who achieved a partial response on the study
drug (patient 229180 in Fig. 3) also experienced a 65%
drop in IL-2 production, whereas the median change in
IL-2 production for all study subjects was 0%.

Notch Gene Correlates in Tumor Tissue

Fresh pretreatment and 3-week on-treatment tumor biopsies for gene expression profiling were obtained from 1
patient. When the known Notch target genes Hey1 and
Hes1 were interrogated, no decrease was seen at the ontreatment time point (Fig. 4). Although these data were
obtained from only 1 patient, they are consistent with the
peripheral blood T-cell surrogate tissue analysis and suggest that stable inhibition of the Notch pathway might
not have been achieved in tumor tissue.
Archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor
tissue was available from 12 eligible patients and was analyzed for baseline parameters indicative of Notch pathway
activation. All samples showed some degree of staining for
Notch1 by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5), and this suggested the availability of Notch for engagement. To further explore whether the Notch pathway was activated,
quantitative RT-PCR was performed for the expression of
the Notch target genes Hes1 and Hey1. The signal for
Hes1 was more robust and was chosen as the reference for
Cancer

activation. All samples showed detectable expression of
Hes1 messenger RNA above the background at the baseline; most of these showed expression of Hey1 as well
(Fig. 6). Hey1 expression alone was detected in 1 additional sample. These results confirm that the Notch pathway is indeed activated in a major fraction of melanoma
patients. When the patient samples were divided into
high and low expression of Hes1 and Hey1 according to
whether the expression was above or below the median for
all the samples, there was no significant association found
between high expression of Hes1 and PFS (P 5 .83), OS
(P 5 .70), ORR (P 5 1.00), or DCR (P 5 .55) or
between high expression of Hey1 and PFS (P 5 .48), OS
(P 5 .59), ORR (P 5 .45), or DCR (P 5 1.00). However,
the sample size was small and was not powered to evaluate
a correlation between target gene expression and clinical
outcomes. Because tumors in our study were not required
to be molecularly characterized, we were unable to study a
potential relationship between Notch1 activation and the
presence of other oncogenic or related pathways such as
BRAF activation.
DISCUSSION
This phase 2 clinical trial evaluated the safety, antitumor
activity, and laboratory correlates of the GSI RO4929097
in patients with stage IV cutaneous melanoma. Although
well-tolerated, RO4929097 demonstrated minimal activity with the recommended phase 2 dose and schedule in
these molecularly unselected patients with advanced melanoma. One of the known downstream effects of Notch inhibition is the impairment of T-cell function, which is

Figure 5. Notch1 expression was seen via immunohistochemistry in all 12 available patient tumor samples (7 had moderate
expression, and 5 had strong expression). Two representative patient samples are shown here of (B) moderate Notch1 expression
and (D) strong Notch1 expression, along with their IgG controls (A) and (C), respectively.

perhaps best demonstrated by the ability of Notch inhibitors to block graft-versus-host disease in animal models.20,21 The absence of T-cell functional impairment, as
measured by changes in IL-2 production, in most patients
after treatment with the study drug, in addition to the
lack of downregulation of Notch target genes Hey1 and
Hes1 after 3 weeks on the study drug in 1 patient, suggests
that sustained target inhibition may not have been
achieved in most subjects. A definitive analysis would
require serial biopsies from a greater number of patients.
Although a firm conclusion cannot be drawn from a single
data point, it is of interest that the only patient who experienced a partial response to the study drug also demonstrated a 65% drop in IL-2 production, whereas the
median change in IL-2 production of the study patients
overall was 0%; this suggests the possibility that more
effective Notch inhibition may have been achieved in this
patient.
One possible explanation for why responses to
RO4929097 were higher in the phase 1 trial may be that
the more intense dosing schedules investigated in that
study, while causing more toxicity, may have also achieved
better target inhibition. All 4 patients who experienced tumor regression in the phase 1 study had been treated on
the 7-days-on/14-days-off schedule, and the best re438

sponder, who had an objective partial response in that
trial, was treated at a dose of 40 mg, whereas a 20-mg dose
and a 3-days-on/4-days-off schedule were used in the current study. The reported stable disease rate was also
slightly higher (32%) on the 7-days-on/14-days-off schedule versus the 3-days-on/4-days-off schedule (25%). A
phase 2 study of RO4929097 in metastatic colorectal cancer treated with at least 2 prior lines of systemic chemotherapy also used the 20-mg dose on a 3-days-on/4-daysoff schedule and observed no objective responses among
33 evaluable patients despite immunohistochemistry evidence for the expression of Notch receptor, intracellular
Notch, and transcriptional target HES1 in the majority of
patient tumors.22 However, repeated dosing higher than
20 mg on a 3-days-on/4-days-off schedule also led to significant cytochrome P450 3A4 auto-induction in the
phase 1 trial, and this poses an additional pharmacokinetic ceiling further limiting the narrow therapeutic index
of this drug. Notably, in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a tumor with a greater than 50% incidence of activating mutations in Notch1, the use of GSIs also led to
disappointing clinical results, largely because of an unfavorable therapeutic index.23 Thus, although we did not
perform pharmacokinetic analyses in this study, we
believe that the use of the recommended phase 2 dose

point blockade with anti–cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen
4 and/or anti–programmed death 1 is rapidly becoming a
mainstay of treatment for multiple cancers.
Because of the auto-induction of metabolism of
RO4929097 and the gastrointestinal toxicities, which
have limited higher dosing of this and other GSIs,24-26 the
use of GSIs for targeting the Notch pathway in tumors
may not be the best direction for continued future drug
development. However, our data confirming that the
pathway is active in most melanomas, combined with laboratory data indicating that Notch inhibition has major
antitumor activity against melanoma both in vitro and in
vivo, suggest that alternative strategies for targeting the
Notch pathway are warranted. A monoclonal antibody to
a Notch ligand has been shown in preclinical studies to be
a promising mechanism for achieving Notch inhibition,20,27 and it is currently being studied in a phase 1
clinical trial (NCT01577745). As these and other more
effective Notch inhibitors are studied as cancer therapeutics, a more detailed analysis of effects on T-cell subsets
will be warranted. Aberrant Notch signaling is a critical
pathway in tumorigenesis and remains a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment; however, this phase 2
trial does not support the continued development of the
GSI RO4929097 in unselected patients with metastatic
melanoma.

from phase 1 development could have underexposed
patients to the drug and/or resulted in a gradual fall in
peak and/or steady-state drug exposures.
It remains to be seen whether the degree and nature
of T-cell impairment induced by optimal Notch inhibition will cause a clinical impact on the patient’s endogenous antitumor T-cell responses to melanoma and how
this would affect the timing of Notch therapy with respect
to immune-based therapies in a patient’s treatment
course. The parallel development of both immunotherapies and targeted signal transduction inhibitors for melanoma, the latter of which could also adversely affect T-cell
function, is a potential challenge that may require logical
adjustments in scheduling to maximize therapeutic synergy in combination. The downstream effects on T-cell
function by Notch inhibitors remain an important area of
investigation in other tumor types also as the landscape of
immunotherapy continues to unfold, and T-cell checkCancer
