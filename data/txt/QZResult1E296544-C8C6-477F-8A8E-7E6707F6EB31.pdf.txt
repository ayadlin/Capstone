ABSTRACT
Prior studies implicate type 1 IGF receptor (IGF-1R) in mediating chemoresistance. Here, we investigated whether IGF-1R influences response to temozolomide
(TMZ), which generates DNA adducts that are removed by O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT), or persist causing replication-associated double-strand
breaks (DSBs). Initial assessment in 10 melanoma cell lines revealed that TMZ
resistance correlated with MGMT expression (r = 0.79, p = 0.009), and in MGMTproficient cell lines, with phospho-IGF-1R (r = 0.81, p = 0.038), suggesting that
TMZ resistance associates with IGF-1R activation. Next, effects of IGF-1R inhibitors
(IGF-1Ri) AZ3801 and linsitinib (OSI-906) were tested on TMZ-sensitivity, cell
cycle progression and DSB induction. IGF-1Ri sensitized BRAF wild-type and mutant
melanoma cells to TMZ in vitro, an effect that was independent of MGMT. Cells
harboring wild-type p53 were more sensitive to IGF-1Ri, and showed scheduledependent chemo-sensitization that was most effective when IGF-1Ri followed TMZ.
This sequence sensitized to clinically-achievable TMZ concentrations and enhanced
TMZ-induced apoptosis. Simultaneous or prior IGF-1Ri caused less effective chemosensitization, associated with increased G1 population and reduced accumulation
of TMZ-induced DSBs. Clinically relevant sequential (TMZ ã IGF-1Ri) treatment was
tested in mice bearing A375M (V600E BRAF, wild-type p53) melanoma xenografts,
achieving peak plasma/tumor IGF-1Ri levels comparable to clinical Cmax, and
inducing extensive intratumoral apoptosis. TMZ or IGF-1Ri caused minor inhibition
of tumor growth (gradient reduction 13%, 25% respectively), while combination
treatment caused supra-additive growth delay (72%) that was significantly different
from control (p < 0.01), TMZ (p < 0.01) and IGF-1Ri (p < 0.05) groups. These data
highlight the importance of scheduling when combining IGF-1Ri and other targeted
agents with drugs that induce replication-associated DNA damage.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Metastatic melanoma is highly chemo-resistant:
dacarbazine or temozolomide (TMZ) induce responses in
<20% of patients, with very limited survival benefit [1, 2].
Approximately 40–50% of melanomas harbour activating
mutations in the RAS-RAF axis, commonly V600E BRAF
[3]. The outlook has improved significantly following
development of novel forms of immunotherapy and
mutant BRAF inhibitors, although responses to the latter
are often brief, with early emergence of resistance [4, 5].
Type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R)
is frequently up-regulated in cancers including melanoma,
and promotes proliferation and cell survival [6, 7]. IGF1R expression has been associated with an aggressive
clinical course and resistance to chemotherapy and
targeted agents [8–10]. We previously showed that IGF1R depletion blocks survival of BRAF mutant and wildtype (WT) melanoma cells, and enhances chemosensitivity
[11]. Recently, we reported that IGF-1R depletion or
inhibition delay repair of radiation-induced DNA doublestrand breaks (DSBs), with evidence of impaired repair
by both non-homologous end-joining and homologous
recombination (HR) [12, 13]. Many cytotoxic drugs cause
DNA damage that is induced during DNA replication,
requiring HR for repair [14]. Initiation of HR is very
tightly coupled to cell cycle regulation, itself known to
be influenced by IGFs [7, 15]. Therefore, as a tool to
probe the relationship between IGF-1R and induction
of replication-associated DNA damage, we examined
responses to TMZ, a methylating agent used to treat
glioblastoma multiforme and melanoma [16].
We tested two ATP-competitive IGF-1R tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (IGF-1Ri): preclinical compound
AZ12253801 (AZ3801), used in our study of effects
of IGF-1Ri on the DNA damage response [13], and
OSI-906 (linsitinib), developed for clinical evaluation
[17–19]. AZ3801 has ~10 fold selectivity over the
insulin receptor (INSR), with IC50 values for inhibition
of IGF-1R of 2.1 nM and INSR 19 nM [13]. OSI-906 is
~2-fold more potent against IGF-1R than INSR (IC50
values 35 nM and 75 nM respectively), and recently
completed Phase I trials using intermittent or continuous
schedules [17–19]. Our data show an association between
WT p53 status and sensitivity to IGF-1Ri, reveal that
IGF-1R activation correlates with resistance to TMZ, and
show that significant enhancement of chemo-sensitivity
is induced by a sequential (TMZ → IGF-1Ri) schedule.
In contrast, IGF-1Ri pre-treatment causes less effective
chemo-sensitization, and we show for the first time that
pre-inhibiting IGF-1R induces cell cycle delay associated
with reduced yield of toxic chemotherapy-induced
DNA damage. These findings have clear relevance to
the design of future trials of IGF axis inhibitors with
chemotherapy.

IGF-1R phosphorylation associates with
resistance of melanoma cell lines to TMZ

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In a human melanoma cell line panel we assessed
levels and activation of IGF-1R and its effectors AKT
and ERKs, and expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT) that removes the most
toxic TMZ-induced DNA adduct, O6-methyguanine
(O6-meG; [16]; Figure 1A). All cell lines expressed IGF1R, with variable receptor phosphorylation. Reflecting
the frequency of RAS-RAF activation [3], phospho-ERK
was detectable in all cell lines except CHL1 that harbors
WT BRAF/NRAS (Table 1). In a first approach to test the
relationship between IGF-1R and chemo-resistance, we
evaluated TMZ in viability assays (Figure 1B, Table 1).
All  cell lines were relatively TMZ-resistant, with GI50
values 155–950 μM, above 60 μM, the clinicallyachievable Cmax [1]. MGMT-deficient SKmel23,
A2058 and HMCB were relatively sensitive (TMZ GI50
155 - 215  μM), and MGMT-positive cell lines more
resistant (TMZ GI50 ≥ 250 μM; Table 1). TMZ GI50 values
significantly correlated with MGMT expression (r = 0.79,
p = 0.009; Figure 1C, upper panel), and showed borderline
correlation with IGF-1R protein levels (r = 0.64, p = 0.052,
Supplementary Figure S1A). In 7 MGMT proficient cell
lines, there was significant correlation between TMZ GI50
and phospho-IGF-1R (r = 0.81, p = 0.038; Figure 1C
lower), suggesting association between activated IGF-1R
and intrinsic TMZ resistance. These results prompted us to
test effects of IGF-1Ri on growth and chemo-resistance.

Cells that harbor WT p53 are more sensitive to
IGF-1R inhibition
Initial experiments tested sensitivity to IGF-1R
inhibitor OSI-906, which was shown to be capable of
blocking IGF-1R activation for ≥72 hr in A375M cells
(Figure 1D). In the cell line panel, OSI-906 caused variable
concentration-dependent inhibition of melanoma cell
viability (Figure 1E), with GI50 values from the nanomolar
to low micromolar range (Table 1). These are clinically
achievable concentrations: continuous OSI-906 dosing at
150 mg BID achieves plasma levels of ~1000–2000  ng/
ml (2.4–4.8 μM), while 600 mg OSI-906 intermittently
achieves Cmax of ~8000 ng/ml (~20 μM), remaining at
24 hr above 1 μM, predicted to be required for efficacy
[18, 19]. Here, there was no correlation between OSI-906
sensitivity and total/activated IGF-1R in the melanoma
cell lines, and no evidence that downstream pathway
activation due to PTEN loss, BRAF or NRAS mutation
was associated with IGF-1Ri resistance, consistent with
our previous data using IGF1R gene silencing [11]. We
noted that the three most IGF-1Ri-resistant cell lines

(GI50 ~10 μM or greater) harbored mutant p53 (Table 1).
Given that these cell lines are genetically heterogeneous,
we tested the relationship between p53 and response to
IGF-1Ri in p53-null B231 cells, in which expression of
WT p53 was induced by doxycycline (Figure 1F; [20]. WT
p53 is reported to suppress IGF-1R expression [21], but
did not influence IGF-1R levels here. The p53 null cells
were relatively resistant to OSI-906 (GI50 > 1 μM), and
doxycycline-treated cells more sensitive (GI50 116 nM),
indicating ≥8-fold sensitization to OSI-906. Thus in both
this isogenic model and the melanoma cell lines, lack of
WT p53 correlated with relative resistance to IGF-1Ri.

in BRAF mutant A375M and BRAF WT CHL1,
relatively TMZ-resistant (TMZ GI50 800 μM) and
sensitive (250 μM), respectively (Table 1). Like OSI906, AZ3801 caused dose-dependent IGF-1R inhibition
for up to 72 hr (Figure  2A). On testing responses
to TMZ alone or with IGF-1Ri in survival assays,
both OSI-906 and AZ3801 induced dose-dependent
TMZ sensitization in each cell line (Figure  2B, 2C,
Supplementary Figure 1B–1C). The effect size was
similar with both inhibitors, and comparable to TMZsensitization we previously reported in IGF-1R-depleted
melanoma cells [11], supporting the contention that
sensitization was related to IGF-1R inhibition. To
explore the molecular basis for chemosensitization, we
performed caspase 3/7 activity assays (Figure 2D) and
western blotting for PARP cleavage (Supplementary
Figure S2A), detecting increased TMZ-induced
apoptosis in IGF-1R inhibited cells after 24–48 hr.
However, the effect of AZ3801 on apoptosis did

not increase with TMZ concentration, unlike the
pattern of chemo-sensitization (Figure 2B–2C),
suggesting that chemo-sensitization was unlikely to
be wholly attributable to apoptosis induction at these
early time-points. Therefore, we next investigated
whether IGF-1R influences repair of TMZ-induced DNA
damage.
The most toxic alkylated base lesion produced by
TMZ is O6-meG, which can be directly repaired by methyl
group transfer to a cysteine residue in the MGMT active
site pocket [16]. MGMT downregulation is associated,
as here (Figure 1C upper), with melanoma sensitivity to
TMZ in vitro, although not clinically [22]. Other base
lesions include N7-meG, the commonest TMZ-induced
lesion, which undergoes spontaneous depurination to
generate toxic apurinic (AP) sites, and N3meA, which
is intrinsically cytotoxic. Both lesions can be excised
by 3-alkyladeinine DNA glycosylase (AAG) [23]. To
test whether IGF-1Ri influences MGMT and AAG, we
first performed chemo-sensitivity assays in MGMTnull SKmel23 cells, which are highly TMZ sensitive,
but even so IGF-1R induced further sensitization
(Figure  2E). Secondly, in MGMT-proficient CHL1 and
A375M, MGMT activity/expression was unaffected
by IGF-1Ri (Supplementary Figure 2B left panel, 2C).
MGMT assay specificity was supported by abolition
of MGMT activity in CHL1 and A375M by MGMT
substrate analogue O6-Benzylguanine (O6BG), and by
undetectable MGMT activity in SKmel23 (Supplementary
Figure 2B left panel). Similarly, IGF-1Ri did not influence
AAG activity or TMZ-induced O6-meG or N7-meG
adducts (Supplementary Figure 2B right panel, 2D–2E).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Furthermore, AZ3801 was capable of sensitizing to TMZ
in CHL1 cells in which MGMT was inhibited by O6BG
(Figure 2F). These results suggest that with respect to
TMZ-sensitization, IGF-1R does not function in the same
pathway as MGMT.

IGF-1R inhibition induces schedule-dependent
chemo-sensitization of melanoma cells
If MGMT levels are inadequate, O6-meG persists
and undergoes post-replicative mispairing to form G:T
pairs that are substrates for mismatch repair. Repeated
‘futile cycles’ of exonuclease activity and mispairing
lead to extension of single-stranded gaps, resulting after
≥2 rounds of replication in replication fork collapse and
formation of DSBs [16]. Given that IGFs are well-known
to promote cell cycle progression [7], it is plausible that
inhibiting this function could influence accumulation
of replication-associated DSBs. As an initial step to
investigate interactions between the IGF axis and
TMZ-response, we tested whether chemo-sensitization
is influenced by sequencing IGF-1Ri with respect to
TMZ. Based on initial chemo-sensitivity data (Figure
2B–2C), we first tested each drug separately to choose
concentrations for combination experiments, using TMZ
at 100–250 μM, and OSI-906 at 300–1000 nM in CHL1
and 30–300 nM in A375M; 1000 nM was too toxic in
these cells for combination testing (Figure 3A–3B). We
next tested whether chemo-sensitization is influenced
by sequencing of IGF-1Ri, using schedules illustrated in
Figure 3C. There was no evidence of antagonism (ie no

increase in TMZ SF50 in OSI-906-treated cells), although
cells pre-treated with 30 nM OSI-906 were no more
TMZ-sensitive than controls. With this exception, IGF1R-inhibited cells showed dose-dependent sensitization
to TMZ (Figure 3D), most effectively when OSI-906
was applied 24 hr after TMZ, compared with cells that
were pre-treated or simultaneously-treated. Notably, posttreatment with 300 nM OSI-906 achieved TMZ SF50 of
45 μM (Figure 3D, right panel), representing > 5.5 fold
sensitization compared with control (OSI-906-untreated)
cells. This SF50 value is below the Cmax of TMZ (~11 μg/
ml, ~60 μM) administered clinically as a single agent [1].
Equivalent experiments in CHL1 cells confirmed TMZsensitization, but there was no difference in efficacy when
IGF-1Ri was added before, concurrently or after TMZ
(Supplementary Figure 3A–3B).

Aiming to understand the basis for scheduledependent chemo-sensitization of A375M cells and the
lack of sequence variation in CHL1, we investigated
changes in cell cycle distribution. After 24 hr exposure
to OSI-906 or AZ3801, there was increase in G1 and
reduction in S phase fraction (Supplementary Figure S4A–
S4B), consistent with the ability of IGFs to promote G1
to S transition [7]. TMZ-treated cells showed an increased
G2 population and progressive reduction in S-phase, also
evident upon combination treatment and most pronounced
at 72 hr (Supplementary Figure S4A–S4B). Fixing on
this 72 hr post-TMZ time-point, we tested effects of

altering the sequence of IGF-1Ri with respect  to TMZ,
using  the  same  schedule (Figure 3C) as for chemosensitivity testing. These experiments used 300 nM
OSI-906, confirmed to inhibit IGF signaling in both cell
lines (Figure 4A). In A375M, TMZ-induced reduction in
S-phase and increase in G2 was unaffected by IGF-1R
pre-, co- or post- inhibition (Figure 4B–4C). However,
the  G1 population was significantly increased when
IGF-1R was pre- or co- inhibited, compared with TMZ
alone and with IGF-1R post-inhibition (Figure 4C). TMZ
induced appearance of non-cycling S-phase cells with
DNA content between 2N and 4N but without BrdU
incorporation (Figure 4C), suggesting intra-S checkpoint
activation [24]. This population was reduced by IGF-1Ri;
further work is required to test whether this represents loss
of checkpoint integrity. We noted appearance of pre-G1
(likely apoptotic) DNA content, significantly greater in
IGF-1R post-inhibited cells, correlating with the pattern
of chemo-sensitization (Figure 3D). In contrast, IGF1Ri-treated CHL1 cells showed no change in cell cycle
distribution of viable cells, although there was an increase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in the pre-G1 population in IGF-1R post-inhibited cells
compared with TMZ alone (Figure 4D). To check whether
this represented increased apoptosis, we assessed caspase
activation by western blot (Figure 4E). TMZ alone
generated little positive signal in either cell line, with an
increase on addition of OSI-906, particularly upon posttreatment in A375M. We also probed for DNA damage
marker γH2AX, noting that relative γH2AX signals in
OSI-906 pre, co- and post- treated A375M cells (Figure 4E
left) paralleled the pattern of relative chemo-sensitization
(Figure 3D), with more intense signal upon IGF-1R postinhibition. In CHL1, where sequencing did not influence
chemo-sensitivity, IGF-1Ri did not influence TMZinduced γH2AX (Figure 4E right).
The γH2AX western blot suggested possible
excess DNA damage in A375M cells treated with OSI906 after TMZ. Although principally induced by DSBs,
non-focal γH2AX can be induced by other processes
including apoptosis [25, 26]. Therefore, we assessed
immunofluorescent γH2AX foci formed at sites of DSBs.

blotting data, we detected γH2AX foci in TMZ-treated
cells (Figure 4F), and quantified changes in cells exposed
to TMZ alone or with pre-, co- or post- treatment with
OSI-906, as Figure 3C. As a single agent, TMZ induced
more foci in CHL1 than A375M cells (Supplementary
Figure S4C), consistent with relative TMZ sensitivities
in viability assays (Table 1). There was no difference
in TMZ-induced foci in IGF-1Ri-treated A375M or
CHL1 cells at this 72 hr time-point (Supplementary
Figure  S4C). In light of the cell cycle changes seen
previously (Figure 4C), and the time needed to generate
toxic DSBs, we repeated this assessment 120 hr postTMZ. Here, we observed significant reduction in TMZinduced γH2AX foci in A375M cells pre- or co-treated
with OSI-906 compared with cells treated with TMZ alone
or TMZ followed by OSI-906 (Figure 4G, left). These
findings suggest reduced induction of DNA damage as

a consequence of G1 accumulation of IGF-1R pre- or
co- inhibited cells. In contrast, IGF-1R inhibition did
not influence TMZ-induced γH2AX foci in CHL1 cells
(Figure 4G, right), in which there were no sequencedependent changes in TMZ-sensitization (Supplementary
Figure S3) or cell cycle distribution (Figure 4D).

OSI-906 enhances sensitivity of melanoma
xenografts to temozolomide
To explore the therapeutic potential of these data,
we tested whether OSI-906 is tolerable with TMZ in
vivo, employing the sequential (TMZ → OSI-906)
schedule identified as optimal in vitro (Figure 3D), and
using A375M, known to be tumorigenic in vivo [27]. To
mimic clinical treatment, TMZ was dosed on days 1–5
in Ora-Plus, as previously tested in glioblastoma [28].

After 5 days, TMZ-treated mice were divided into
groups for IGF-1Ri dosing (Supplementary Figure S5A).
OSI-906 is insoluble in aqueous solution, and has been
previously dosed in tartaric acid [29]. In case this acid
solvent could exacerbate toxicity, we compared OSI906 administration in tartaric acid, Ora-Plus or corn oil
(Figure 5A). TMZ and OSI-906 were tolerable when
administered sequentially with weight loss generally
<10%, with the exception of OSI-906 in tartaric acid
(~12.5%), although OSI-906-treated groups were not
significantly different (Supplementary Figure S5A–S5B).
TMZ induced a trend to tumor growth delay (Figure 5A,
Supplementary Figure S5C), but this experiment was

not powered to detect differences in tumor volume. Four
hours after final OSI-906 dosing, blood and tumor were
collected for immunohistochemical and pharmacokinetic
analysis. Ki67 positivity was detectable in all tumors,
with evidence of reduction in the TMZ-alone group
(Figure  5B, 5C), paralleling the reduced S-phase fraction

clearly detectable in tumors treated with TMZ followed

[18, 19]. Ora-Plus was chosen to administer both TMZ
and OSI-906, to assess effects on tumor growth.
Mice bearing A375M xenografts were treated with
vehicle (Ora-Plus) alone, TMZ, OSI-906, or both drugs,
using clinically relevant schedules, dosing TMZ on
days 1–5 and OSI-906 on three days per week [1, 18].
This intermittent schedule allowed us to adopt the drugsequencing regimen (TMZ → OSI-906) that was more
effective in vitro (Figure 3D). After a second cycle of
TMZ, OSI-906 dosing continued on a D1–3 q7 day cycle
(Figure 5E). Both TMZ and OSI-906 induced weight loss
<10%, which in the case of OSI-906 was rapid onset,
unaccompanied by distress, and recovering rapidly on
days off-treatment (Supplementary Figure S5D). Effects on
tumor growth are shown in Figure 5E. Untreated control
tumors grew rapidly, achieving a volume of 1000 mm3 in
29 ± 2 days from the start of treatment. TMZ or OSI-906
caused minor growth delay, taking 36 ± 6 and 39 ± 5 days
respectively to reach 1000 mm3, not significantly different
from controls (Supplementary Figure S5E). Combination
treatment induced significant growth delay, tumors taking
79 ± 4 days to attain 1000 mm3 (p < 0.001 compared with
the other groups, Supplementary Figure S5E). Growth
delay was also evident when evaluating the gradient of
tumor growth (Figure 5F), which was reduced by TMZ
or OSI-906 by 13% and 25% respectively compared
with controls. If additive, combination treatment would
induce 38% reduction; the observed reduction was 78%,
suggesting supra-additivity. Furthermore, survival was
prolonged by the combination treatment compared with
the other three groups (Supplementary Figure S5F). These
results suggest that OSI-906 can be administered with TMZ
to xenograft-bearing mice, and effects on melanoma growth
are supra-additive compared with either agent alone.

IGF-1R as a key driver of AKT phosphorylation in KRAS
mutant NSCLC [32]. In addition, we noted that in the
melanoma cell lines and an isogenic NSCLC model,
loss of WT p53 correlated with resistance to IGF-1R
inhibition. The association of WT p53 with sensitivity to
IGF-1R inhibition was also reported using the non-ATPcompetitive IGF-1R inhibitor picropodophyllin [33], and
may be relevant in selecting patients for treatment with
IGF-1R inhibitory drugs.
The melanoma cell lines were relatively TMZ
resistant, with GI50 and SF50 values above the clinical
Cmax [1]. Our results indicate a correlation between
intrinsic TMZ resistance and IGF-1R activation, and
show that two different small molecule IGF-1R inhibitors
sensitize human melanoma cells to TMZ. Both IGF1Ri agents used here also inhibit INSR, and it would be
informative to measure INSR expression in the melanoma
cell line panel, to assess the contribution of this receptor
to chemo-resistance. IGF-1R inhibitors have also been
shown to enhance TMZ-sensitivity in neuroblastoma
and medulloblastoma [34, 35]. These and other studies
implicated IGF-1R as a mediator of chemo-resistance
via regulation of AKT activation, cell cycle progression
and cell survival [34–36]. In our study, IGF-1R-inhibited
melanoma cells showed enhanced TMZ-induced apoptosis,
relatively minor at 24–48 hr, more substantial 72 hr postTMZ in vitro, and much more striking in melanoma
xenografts after 5 days of TMZ and 3 days of OSI-906
(Figure 5B, 5C). These differences could reflect the greater
dependence on IGF-1R for anchorage-independent 3D vs
2D growth [37], and/or the more prolonged time-course of
the in vivo experiment.
In addition to regulating apoptosis, two additional
mechanisms may be relevant to IGF-1R-mediated
chemo-resistance. Firstly, cytotoxic drugs are reported to
induce IGF-1R activation, which can be suppressed by
IGF-1R inhibition [38]. Secondly, there is evidence from
our group and others that a functional IGF-1R is required
for DSB repair by HR, which is required for the repair
of replication-associated DSBs induced by TMZ [12, 13,
39, 40]. However, combining IGF-1Ri with phase-specific
chemotherapy raises concerns that sensitization to TMZ
could be antagonized by delayed cell cycle progression
in IGF-1R-inhibited cells. While we found no evidence
of antagonism, we did observe more effective chemosensitization in vitro using sequential (TMZ → OSI906) application (Figure 3D). We found no evidence that
IGF-1R inhibition influenced removal of TMZ adducts
(Supplementary Figure S2B–S2E), or delayed resolution
of TMZ-induced DNA damage foci (Figure 4G), in
contrast to the delayed repair of radiation-induced DSBs
we reported recently [13]. There was, however, evidence
that IGF-1R pre-inhibition caused accumulation of cells
in G1, and reduced the subsequent yield of toxic TMZinduced γH2AX foci (Figure 4C, 4G). Co-application
of IGF-1R inhibitor showed the same phenotype, which

DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that human melanoma cell
lines show variable sensitivity to IGF-1Ri, consistent
with data from large drug screens in which A375 and
SKmel2 were more sensitive to OSI-906 and A2058,
CHL1 and SKmel28 more resistant [30]. Here, some cell
lines showed potent inhibition of proliferation and cell
survival at clinically-achievable OSI-906 concentrations.
Indeed, the Phase 1 study of continuous oral dosing of
OSI-906 reported an objective partial response, converted
by surgery into a highly durable complete response, in
one of 3 melanoma patients [19]. In the current study,
responses to OSI-906 were unrelated to levels of total or
activated IGF-1R, consistent with clinical findings that
IGF-1R expression does not predict sensitivity to IGF1R inhibition [31]. The most sensitive cell lines (501mel,
A375, A375M; Table 1) harbor V600E BRAF; supporting
activity in the context of activating RAS-RAF mutations,

is logical given the delay in induction of TMZ-induced
DSBs. We also noted that the differences in γH2AX signal
on western blot of A375M cells (Figure 4E, left) appeared
to be more marked than the changes in γH2AX foci
(Figure 4G), possibly implicating other processes such as
apoptosis or replication stress that induce γH2AX [25].
Previous studies have recognized that delayed cell
cycle progression induced by targeted agents including
IGF-1Ri show potential to protect tumors against phase
specific cytotoxic drugs [29, 41]. To our knowledge this
protective effect has not until now been confirmed to
be associated with reduced accumulation of toxic DNA
damage. Unfortunately, this potential for antagonism has
not been taken into account in the design of previous
trials of IGF-1Ri with chemotherapy, and could have
compromised outcomes in previous studies combining
long half-life IGF-1R antibodies with phase-specific
cytotoxic drugs [42–44]. Of potential relevance, we note
that both A375M and CHL1 cells harbor mutant CDKN2A,
which encodes mutant p16INK4a with reduced capacity to
inhibit the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex that regulates the G1
to S transition [45]. Despite this, A375M cells responded
to IGF-1Ri with accumulation in G1. While CHL1 cells
were chemo-sensitized by IGF-1Ri, this effect did not vary
with sequence, and nor did they show sequence-related
changes in cell cycle distribution. It is possible that lack
of schedule-dependence in this cell line could be due to
the presence of mutant p53, while A375M cells harbour
WT p53, and/or a reflection of the lesser sensitivity of
CHL1 cells to IGF-1R inhibition. Although CHL1 cells
did not show sequence-dependent differences in chemosensitivity, post-TMZ inhibition of IGF-1R was as
effective as pre- or co- treatment. Therefore, the cytotoxic
→ IGF-1Ri sequence is preferred for future studies. Our
data confirm that this sequential combination treatment
regimen is tolerable in vivo, inducing supra-additive
inhibition of melanoma xenograft growth, using doses and
schedules of both drugs consistent with clinical use [1, 18].
In summary, our data support the concept that
the IGF axis is an important mediator of therapy
resistance. By exploiting interactions between the cell
cycle, DNA damage response and apoptosis induction,
IGF1R inhibition can be an effective route to chemosensitization. Our findings also highlight the importance
of scheduling when combining IGF-1R inhibitory drugs
and other targeted agents with cytotoxic drugs that induce
replication-associated DNA damage.

for mycoplasma (MycoAlert kit, Lonza Rockland Inc,
Rockland US). AZ3801 and OSI-906 were provided
by Elaine Kilgour (AstraZeneca) and Elizabeth Buck
(OSI Pharmaceuticals/Astellas) respectively. TMZ was
synthesized as described [46] and stored at +4oC protected
from light. For in vitro use, 10 mM stock solutions of
AZ3801, OSI-906, TMZ and O6BG (Sigma) in DMSO
were aliquoted and stored at -20oC. Each agent was freshly
diluted in culture medium to the correct final concentration.
OSI-906 was freshly-prepared as a 10x stock in pre-warmed
culture medium containing 10% FCS and 5% DMSO.
Control cultures were treated with DMSO without drug.

Western blotting, assays for viability, cell
survival and apoptosis
CellTiter Glo (Promega) viability assays and
clonogenic assays were performed as in reference [13], using
cultures growing in full medium supplemented with 10%
FCS. Western blotting was performed as described  [13],
using antibodies to: IGF-1R (#3027, Cell Signaling
Technology, CST), phospho-Y1135/6 IGF-1R (#3024, CST),
phospho-S473 AKT (#4051, CST), total AKT (#9272, CST),
phospho-T202/Y204 ERK 1/2 (#4377, CST), total ERK
1/2 (#4695, CST), MGMT (#557045, BD Pharmingen),
p53 (#9282, CST) PARP (#9542, CST) and actin (ab8224
or ab8227, Abcam). For each western blot shown, similar
results were obtained in 1–2 further independent replicates.
Viability and survival data were graphed and curve-fitted
(GraphPad Prism v5) to interpolate GI50 and SF50 values
(drug concentrations that suppress growth or survival to 50%
of control values). Apoptosis was quantified by Apo-ONE®
Homogenous Caspase 3/7 Assay (Promega).

Assays for MGMT, AAG, O6-meG and N7-meG
MGMT and AAG activity assays were based on
cleavage of 32P labelled oligonucleotides containing single
O6-meG or ethenoadenine residues as described [47, 48].
O6-meG levels in cellular DNA were determined by a
modification of the MGMT activity assay [47] and levels
of N7-meG adducts in cellular DNA were determined by
an immunoslot blot method [49].

approved Project License. Xenografts were established
by injecting 107 A375M cells with matrigel (BD
Biosciences) into the flanks of 6–7 week old female Balb/c
immunodeficient (nu/nu) mice. Tumors were measured
2–3 times a week, volumes were calculated as π(length
x width x height)/6, and mice were randomly allocated
to treatment groups when tumor volumes reached 100–
200 mm3. Treatments were prepared fresh each day,
administered by gavage as a suspension of 2.5  mg/ml
TMZ or OSI-906. Mice were weighed daily when on
treatment to adjust dosing to 50 mg/kg, otherwise weekly.
For initial tolerability and PK testing, mice were treated
with 50 mg/kg TMZ in Ora-Plus (Fagron UK) on days
1–5, followed on days 6–8 by 50 mg/kg OSI-906 in OraPlus, 25 mM tartaric acid or corn oil. Controls were treated
with Ora-Plus. Four hours after final OSI-906 dosing, the
experiment was terminated, whole blood was obtained
under anesthetic by cardiac puncture, and plasma was
stored at –80oC. Tumors were halved for snap-freezing in
