Abstract
Therapies that target the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor have shown unprecedented rates of
durable clinical responses in patients with various cancer types.1–5 One mechanism by which
cancer tissues limit the host immune response is via upregulation of PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and its
ligation to PD-1 on antigen-specific CD8 T-cells (termed adaptive immune resistance).6,7 Here we
show that pre-existing CD8 T-cells distinctly located at the invasive tumour margin are associated
with expression of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune inhibitory axis and may predict response to therapy.

We analyzed samples from 46 patients with metastatic melanoma obtained before and during antiPD1 therapy (pembrolizumab) using quantitative immunohistochemistry, quantitative multiplex
immunofluorescence, and next generation sequencing for T-cell receptors (TCR). In serially
sampled tumours, responding patients showed proliferation of intratumoural CD8+ T-cells that
directly correlated with radiographic reduction in tumour size. Pre-treatment samples obtained
from responding patients showed higher numbers of CD8, PD1, and PD-L1 expressing cells at the
invasive tumour margin and inside tumours, with close proximity between PD-1 and PD-L1, and a
more clonal TCR repertoire. Using multivariate analysis, we established a predictive model based
on CD8 expression at the invasive margin and validated the model in an independent cohort of 15
patients. Our findings indicate that tumour regression following therapeutic PD-1 blockade
requires pre-existing CD8+ T cells that are negatively regulated by PD-1/PD-L1 mediated
adaptive immune resistance.

Recently, we reported sustained tumour regression in 38% of patients in a multiinstitutional, international, phase 1 expansion study evaluating the safety and clinical
activity of pembrolizumab (formerly MK-3475 and lambrolizumab), a humanized
monoclonal antibody against PD-1, in patients with advanced melanoma (ClinicalTrials.gov
number NCT01295827).3,8 PD-L1, known to be expressed by cells in the tumour
microenvironment, engages PD-1 on T cells and subsequently triggers inhibitory signalling
downstream of the TCR, blocking effector functions and reducing T-cell killing capacity.6
PD-L1 can be constitutively expressed on the surface of cancer cells through poorly
characterized oncogenic signalling pathways,9,10 or alternatively, expressed in response to
the presence of T cells producing immune-stimulating cytokines such as interferons.7,11,12
This later process has been termed adaptive immune resistance,6 and represents a
mechanism by which cancer cells attempt to protect themselves from immune-cell mediated
killing.
We sought to determine whether pre-existing tumour-associated CD8+ T-cells inhibited by
PD-1/PD-L1 engagement represent key factors in determining clinical response to PD-1
blocking therapy. Our study cohort consisted of 46 patients with advanced melanoma treated
with single agent pembrolizumab between December 2011 and October 2013 at UCLA
(IRB# 11-003066). Patients underwent tumour biopsies before and during treatment.
Baseline biopsy samples from 15 additional patients with advanced melanoma enrolled in
the same pembrolizumab phase I clinical trial at Gustave Roussy in Villejuif-Paris-Sud,
France (IRB# 11-040) were analysed as a validation cohort (Extended Data Table 1).

We first examined the spatio-temporal dynamics of CD8+ T-cells by performing qualitative
and quantitative IHC analysis for CD8 expression before and during PD-1 blockade in two
tumour compartments: the invasive tumour margin (stromal-tumour edge) and inside the
tumour parenchyma (tumour center).13,14 S100+ expression was used to define the invasive
margin and tumour center (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Pre-treatment samples obtained from
patients who experienced a tumour response (Response group, Fig. 1a), showed higher
CD8+ cell densities at the invasive margin when compared to samples from patients who
progressed during therapy (Progression group, Fig. 1b). Extended Data Table 2 provides the
anatomical location of all tumours serially sampled. Serially sampled tumours during

treatment exhibited a parallel increase in CD8+ cell density at both the invasive margin and
tumour center in the Response group (Spearman’s correlation r = 0.71, p<0.001, Fig. 1c,),
but not in the Progression group (Fig. 1d). Two patients experienced delayed responses (Fig.
1c, triangles) and showed step-wise accumulation of CD8+ cells, with initial increases
restricted to the invasive margin, followed by mobilization into the tumour parenchyma
(Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Author Manuscript

Releasing the PD-1 immune checkpoint in pre-existing tumour antigen-specific T cells at the
invasive margin should lead to T cell proliferation, intratumoural infiltration and increased
effector function. We found a greater increase in CD8+ density from baseline to post-dosing
biopsy that significantly correlated with a decrease in radiographic tumour size (Extended
Data Fig. 2a, Spearman’s correlation r = −0.75, p = 0.0002). During treatment, we found an
increase in cells that were double positive for CD8 and the nuclear proliferation marker
Ki67 in samples from patients with a tumour response, as well as all sub-phases of mitosis
based on characteristic chromatin patterns (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). The postdosing increase in CD8/Ki67 double positive cells was restricted to the tumor parenchyma.
We found increased expression of granzyme B, a cytotoxic granule reflective of CD8
effector function, on CD8+ cells in post-dosing biopsies in the Response group (p < 0.0001;
Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).

The correlation between T-cell activation/effector function and treatment outcome upon
release of the PD-1 immune checkpoint may be driven by the production of interferons by
tumour-infiltrating CD8 cells that induce PD-L1 expression on tumour-resident cells.11,15
To test this mechanism, we stained baseline and post-dosing biopsies for phospho-STAT1
(p-STAT1), which is an immediate downstream effector upon interferon-gamma binding to
its receptor (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). The Response group was associated with
significantly higher expression of pSTAT1+ at the invasive margin, localized to the area of
CD8 infiltrate, before (p=0.002) and during treatment (p < 0.0001), when compared to
biopsies from the Progression group. In serially sampled tumours from the Response group,
pSTAT1 expression was also found to be significantly higher during treatment when
compared to baseline (p = 0.007). These findings prompted us to investigate the association
between CD8, CD4, PD-1, and PD-L1 positive cell densities at baseline and treatment
outcome (Fig. 3a). The Response group was associated with significantly higher numbers of
CD8+, PD-1+, and PD-L1+ cells at both the invasive margin and the tumour center when
compared to the Progression group (CD8, p<0.0001; PD-1, p=0.0002; PD-L1, p=0.006).
However, CD4 expression at baseline was not found to correlate with treatment outcome.
No relationship was found between previous treatment history with ipilimumab (antiCTLA4) and pre-anti-PD1 treatment CD8, PD-1, and PD-L1 expression with respect to
treatment outcome (Extended Data Table 3).
We next determined the relative proximity of PD-1 and PD-L1 as evidence of a physical
interaction between PD-1+ and PD-L1+ cells, a presumptive requisite for adaptive immune
resistance. Fig. 3b shows representative examples of chromogenic PD-1 and PD-L1
expression in serial cut tissue sections as well as multiplexed PD-1xPD-L1
immunoflourescence in pre-treatment samples according to treatment outcome. Using
quantitative multiplexed PD-1xPD-L1 immunofluorescence, we found a significant

correlation between proximity of PD-1 and PD-L1 and response to therapy (Fig. 3c,
p=0.005).

Author Manuscript

We next investigated the relationship between CD8 and PD-L1 using a Spearman’s
correlation analysis and found the two markers to correlate in both the tumour (Spearman r
= .598, p<0.001) and the invasive margin (Spearman r = .527, p<0.001). Furthermore, CD8
and PD-L1 density co-varied with treatment outcome in both the tumour and invasive
margin (p<0.001 for both, Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Immunofluorescence multiplexing for
CD8 and PD-1 corroborated our chromogenic IHC findings that CD8 T cells represented the
primary cellular source of PD-1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Using chromogenic
double staining for SOX-10xPD-L1, we found PD-L1 expression on melanoma cells and
also on cells morphologically consistent with lymphocytes and macrophages in samples
obtained during treatment from the Response group (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Principal
component analysis of samples obtained before treatment showed that CD8, PD-1 and PDL1 expression in the tumour (p=0.001) and at the invasive margin significantly correlated
with treatment outcome (p<0.0001, Extended Data Fig. 5b).

Author Manuscript

The high density of CD8+ cells at the site of the tumour in the Response group is suggestive
of a specific immune response to tumour antigens. Therefore, we hypothesized that a more
restricted TCR sequence usage would reflect a tumour antigen-specific T-cell accumulation
at the tumour site. Using genomic DNA isolated from pre-treatment samples, we performed
next generation sequencing to capture all uniquely rearranged, variable TCR beta chain
regions.16,17 We found that a more restricted TCR beta chain usage, reflecting a T-cell
population that was less diverse in repertoire and more clonal in nature, significantly
correlated with clinical response to pembrolizumab treatment (p=0.004, Fig. 3d). The
clonality read-out was not found to highly correlate with tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte
(TIL) density (R2 = 0.04, Extended Data Fig. 10). However, biopsies from patients with a
tumour response showed evidence of an enriched population of T cells with unique
specificities. In addition, comparison of the TCR clonality at baseline and post-dosing
biopsies showed that samples from Responders had more than 10 times as many clones
expand after anti-PD-1 therapy (Extended Data Fig. 6).

To create the best discriminatory model to assess the probability of clinical response to PD-1
blocking therapies, forward stepwise logistic regression was run on CD8+, CD4+, PD-1+,
and PD-L1+ cell densities within the tumour and the invasive margin. Results of the
stepwise procedure, and a logistic regression model, consistently selected the invasive
margin CD8+ density as the best full predictive parameter (Extended Data Table 4a). The
next best predictors were tumour CD8+ T cell density, tumour and invasive margin PD-1+
density, and tumour and invasive margin PD-L1+ density. Tumour and invasive margin
CD4+ density were the poorest predictors.
To test this predictive model, we obtained pre-treatment biopsies from 15 patients treated at
Gustave Roussy and were blinded to treatment outcome. We quantified CD8+ T cell density
in the invasive margin and utilized our logistic model to calculate a predicted probability of
response for each patient in the validation cohort (Extended Data Table 4b). Out of the 15
patients, we accurately predicted 4 out of 5 patients in the true progression group and 9 out

of 9 patients in the true response group. There was one false positive prediction and one
patient predicted to respond who remains in stable disease.

Our studies build upon the evidence that response rates to PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking
antibodies are higher in patients whose tumours express PD-L1.1,15 Since PD-L1 can be
either constitutively expressed or induced upon T cell recognition and production of
interferons,11,15 we hypothesized that response to PD-1 blockade would more tightly covariate with the inducible PD-L1 expression in the presence of antigen-specific T cells,7
termed adaptive immune resistance.6 Indeed, we found interfacing PD-L1 expressing cells in
tumours and PD-1 positive T-cells in pre-treatment samples of responders. The clinical
relevance of the relative distribution of PD-L1 expression on cancer cells, myeloid-derived
cells and activated T cells in tumours, in terms of treatment outcome, remains to be
elucidated. Our data suggests that PD-L1 may serve as an indirect marker of adaptive
immune resistance in response to tumour antigen-specific T cell infiltration rather than a
static constitutive biomarker. Hence, inducing a type-I interferon inflammatory response in
combination with PD-L1 blockade merits further clinical investigation.11
T cell infiltrates have been found to have predictive value with respect to the natural history
of primary cancers.13,14,18 We build on this and herein report that the baseline density and
location of T cells in metastatic melanomas have predictive value in the treatment outcome
of patients receiving therapies that block the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Releasing the PD-1 immune
checkpoint results in clinically relevant antitumour activity when there is a greater density of
pre-existing tumour antigen-restricted CD8 T cells that are negatively regulated by
PD-1/PD-L1 interactions.

METHODS
Tumour samples

Author Manuscript

Tumour biopsies were obtained from a subset of patients enrolled in a phase 1a clinical trial
that enrolled 411 patients;19 patients were selected for this analysis by having adequate
tumour biopsy samples and clinical follow up. All patients in the study and validation
cohorts underwent mandatory biopsy of a metastatic tumour within 30 days of starting
treatment and one or more optional biopsies at 20–60 days, 60–120 days, or greater than 120
days after starting aPD-1. Samples were immediately fixed in formalin followed by paraffin
embedding. Biopsy collection and analyses were approved by UCLA IRBs 11-001918 and
11-003066. Tumour samples obtained from the initial cohort of 46 patients from UCLA
were analyzed for immunohistochemical analysis of CD8 (n=46 patients, 45 samples before
and 31 samples during treatment), CD4 (n=37 patients, 37 samples before and 0 samples
during treatment), PD-1 (41= patients, 39 samples before and 26 samples during treatment),
PD-L1 (n=38 patients, 38 samples before and 24 samples during treatment), multiplex
immunofluorescence for PD-1 and PD-L1 (n=26 patients, 22 samples before treatment, 25
samples during treatment), multiplex chromogenic staining (n=13 patients, 12 samples
before and 17 samples during treatment), and T-cell receptor (VBeta) repertoire (n=23
patients, 23 samples before treatment). The validation cohort included baseline biopsies of
16 patients from Gustave Roussy.

Patients at both sites received single agent pembrolizumab intravenously in one of three
dosing regimens: 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (2Q3W), 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (10Q3W), or 10
mg/kg every 2 weeks (10Q2W) within a phase 1 clinical trial that enrolled a total of 411
patients.19 Tumour responses to pembrolizumab were evaluated at 12 and 16 weeks after the
first infusion, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Treatment outcomes were statistically identical
between the three dosing regimens. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours
(RECIST) version 1.1 was used to define objective clinical responses by an independent,
central, blinded radiographic review. The protocol allowed to proceed beyond initial
progression at the restaging scans at 3 months and have repeated imaging scans 4 weeks
later following the immune-related response criteria (irRC).20 Following this protocolspecified criteria, two patients had evidence of increase in size of target lesions at 12 weeks,
but met criteria for objective partial response at 36 weeks and were considered within the
Response group but denoted as having a delayed response.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining

Author Manuscript

Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, S100, CD8, CD4, CD80, Ki67, pSTAT1,
and granzyme B at the UCLA Anatomic Pathology IHC Laboratory. Immunostaining was
performed on Leica Bond III autostainers using Leica Bond ancillary reagents and REFINE
polymer DAB detection system. Antibodies used included rabbit polyclonal S100 (DAKO,
1/1500 dilution, low pH retrieval), CD8 clone C8/144B (DAKO, 1/100, low pH retrieval),
rabbit monoclonal pSTAT1 clone D3B7 (Cell Signaling, 1/300 30min, low pH retrieval).
PD1 and PD-L1 single-label chromogenic and multiplexed immunofluorescence triple
staining were performed at Merck laboratories. All staining was performed on Dako
autostainers. Signal in chromogenically labeled slides was visualized with DAB. Signal in
immunofluorescently labeled slides was visualized with Alexafluor 488 and Alexafluor 594
TSA kits (Invitrogen), and nuclei were visualized with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent with
DAPI (Invitrogen). All stained slides were evaluated in a blinded fashion by one
dermatopathologist and one investigator trained to identify the features of melanoma. PD-1
and PD-L1 stained slides were independently evaluated by one pathologist at Merck
laboratories. Slides were examined for the presence of CD8, CD4, Ki67, PD-1, and PD-L1
within the tumour parenchyma (tumour) and the connective tissue surrounding the tumour
(invasive margin).

The anti-PD-L1 antibody clone 22C3 used in the presented IHC studies is a mouse antihuman PD-L1 IgG1κ generated through murine immunization with a fusion protein
containing the human extracellular domain of PD-L1 and subsequent hybridoma formation.
Binding was screened initially using a cell-based ELISA employing stably transfected CHO
cells expressing human PD-L1 as positive control and parental (non-transfected) CHO cells
as negative control. Further screening was performed to assess specificity as an IHC reagent
for use in FFPE sections through correlation of staining prevalence and intensity on FFPE
cell pellets from melanoma cell lines to patterns of expression observed on aliquots of the
same cells analyzed for PD-L1 expression by flow cytometry, and for mRNA expression on
serial sections of the same blocks using the Nanostring platform (Nanostring, Seattle WA).

signal pattern in tissue with PD-L1 in situ hybridization studies performed on serial sections
of the same blocks. Attribution of IHC signal to binding of complementarity determining
regions of the antibody was confirmed by abrogation of signal on preadsorption of the
antibody with immunogen. Antigen stability in cut slides and within paraffin blocks was
evaluated through time course studies to determine changes in dynamic range of the assay
on pre-sectioned slides as well as on fresh cut slides from existing paraffin blocks over
periods of months.

Author Manuscript

Sections cut from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks were deparaffinized and
rehydrated with serial passage through changes of xylene and graded ethanols for PD-1 and
PD-L1 IHC. All slides were subjected to heat induced epitope retrieval in Envision FLEX
Target Retrieval Solution, High pH (cat K8012, Dako, Carpineteria CA). Endogenous
peroxidase in tissues was blocked by incubation of slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution
prior to incubation with primary antibody (anti-PD-L1 clone 22C3, Merck Research
Laboratories, Palo Alto CA or anti-PD-1 clone NAT105, Cell Marque, Rocklin CA) for 60
minutes. Antigen-antibody binding was visualized via application of the FLEX+ polymer
system (cat K8012, Dako, Carpineteria CA) and application of 3,3′ diaminobenzidine
(DAB) chromogen (K4368, Dako). Stained slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and
coverslipped for review.
Digital image acquisition and analysis

Author Manuscript

All slides were scanned at an absolute magnification of 200× (resolution of 0.5 μm/pixel).
An algorithm was designed based on pattern recognition that quantified immune cells within
S100 positive areas (tumour) and S100 negative areas (invasive margin). Image analysis
based on RGB (red, green, blue) spectra was used to detect all cells by counterstaining with
hemotoxylin (blue), and DAB or fast red. The algorithm calculated the density (cells/mm2)
and % cellularity (% positive cells/all nucleated cells) using Indica Labs Halo platform. For
the Proximity Analysis slides fluorescently stained for PD-1 (Alexafluor 488, green channel)
and PD-L1 (Alexafluor 594, red channel) were scanned to generate digital images in which
the entire tumour region was sampled using 10,000 random disks. Disks containing both
green and red signal were scored as positive for PD-1/PD-L1 proximity. The total number of
positive disks was summed to yield a proximity score for each sample. CD8+ expression was
determined using two read-outs that were independent of each other to account for tumour
heterogeneity: cell density (number of positive cells/mm2) and percent cellularity (number
of positive cells/number of nucleated cells). Cell density and percent cellularity correlated
significantly (R2 = 0.89 in tumour and 0.84 in the invasive margin).

Next Generation Sequencing for T-cell receptor clonality
TCR sequencing and clonality quantification was performed as previously described16,17
from tumour samples preserved using RNAlater (Qiagen) and stored at −80°C. DNA was
isolated by mincing followed by extraction utilizing a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). Melanin was
then removed from visibly pigmented melanoma samples using a PCR Inhibitor Removal kit
(Zymo Research). TCRβ CDR3 regions were amplified and sequenced using the survey
ImmunoSeq assay in a multiplexed PCR method using 45 forward primers specific to TCR
Vβ gene segments and 13 reverse primers specific to TCR Jβ gene segments (Adaptive

Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). Reads of length 87 bp were obtained using the Illumina
HiSeq System. For each sample, Shannon entropy was calculated on the clonal abundance of
all productive TCR sequences in the dataset. Shannon entropy was normalized to the range
[0–1] by dividing Shannon entropy by the logarithm of the number of unique productive
TCR sequences in the dataset. This normalized entropy value was then inverted (1 −
normalized entropy) to produce our clonality metric.
PCR template abundance estimation

Author Manuscript

In order to estimate the average read coverage per input template in our multiplex PCR and
sequencing approach, we employed a set of approximately 850 unique types of synthetic
TCR analog, comprising each combination of Vβ and Jβ gene segments.17 These molecules
were included in each PCR reaction at very low concentration so that most unique types of
synthetic template were not observed in the sequencing output. Using the known
concentration of the synthetic template pool, we simulated the relationship between the
number of observed unique synthetic molecules and the total number of synthetic molecules
added to reaction (this is very nearly one-to-one at the low concentrations we employed).
These molecules then allowed us to calculate for each PCR reaction the mean number of
sequencing reads obtained per molecule of PCR template, and thus to estimate the number
of rearranged T cell receptors per diploid genome (i.e., level of TIL infiltration) in the input
material.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Demographic, clinical, and immunohistochemical variables were compared between
responders and progressors using Wilcoxon rank sum tests for ordinal or quantitative
variables and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves for response vs. progression were constructed to assess the proprognostic
ability of CD8, PD-1, CD4, and PD-L1 for both tumour and invasive margin measures. The
area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to measure model performance and the
Wilcoxon test was used to assess significance of the AUC results. A logistic regression
model was constructed using pre-treatment CD 8+ (cells/mm2) versus the outcome of
clinical response (PR+SD vs PD) using the study cohort. This fixed model was then applied
to the CD 8+ density measurements in the Gustave Roussy validation cohort to compute
predicted probabilities of response to treatment. Sensitivity and specificities were calculated.
Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to decompose the variance for the markers
(CD8+, PD-1+, PD-L1+, and CD4+ cell densities in cells/mm2) separately in the tumour and
in the invasive margin. The first principal component accounted for the majority of the
variability in the four markers 69.6% and 57.1% in the tumour and invasive margin
respectively. Principal component scores for the first principal component were compared
between response groups with Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism, SAS, and SPSS. All tests were 2-sided and equal variance was not
assumed unless otherwise stated. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

The x-axis represents clonality of the T cell repertoire (1 – Pielou’s evenness) and the y-axis
represents the density of tumour-infiltrating T cells (estimated TCR gene rearrangements per
diploid genomes, see supplementary methods for further detail). The axes cross at the
median value for clonality and TIL infiltration. TIL infiltration and TIL repertoire clonality
were found to be independent in this cohort (R2 = 0.04). Progressors were associated with
lower levels of TIL infiltration and lower TIL clonality (i.e., a more diverse TIL repertoire);
all patients with below-median clonality and TIL infiltration progressed. b, The uniqueness

Figure 3. Baseline density, location, and proximity of CD8+, PD-1+, PD-L1+, and CD4+ cells, and
T cell repertoire according to treatment outcome

a, Melanoma samples collected before treatment with PD-1 blocking therapy were assessed
for CD8 (Response n=22, Progression n=24), PD-1 (Response n=19, Progression n=21),
PD-L1 (Response n=17, Progression n=21), and CD4 (Response n=19, Progression n=18)
density by quantitative immunohistochemistry in the tumour compartment and at the
invasive margin. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. b, Examples of the relative
proximity of PD-1 and PD-L1 expressing cells in representative baseline samples from a
responder and a progressor. c, Proximity analysis of PD-1 and PD-L1 based on multiplex
