ABSTRACT
Background: Cell therapy holds the most promising for acute and chronic
deleterious respiratory diseases. However, the safety and tolerance for lung disorders
are controversy.
Methods: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analyses of all 23 clinical
studies of cell therapy. The outcomes were odds ratio (OR), risk difference (RD), Peto
OR, relative risk, and mean difference of serious adverse events.
Results: 342 systemic infusions and 57 bronchial instillations (204 recipients) of
cells were analyzed for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchopulmonary
dysplasia, pulmonary arterial hypertension, silicosis, sarcoidosis, extensively drugresistant tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), and idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. The frequency of death in adults from any causes was 71 and 177
per 1,000 for cell therapy and controls, respectively, with an OR of 0.31 (95% CI:
0.03, 3.76) and RD of -0.22 (95% CI: -0.53, 0.09). No significant difference was found
for ARDS and COPD. The frequency of deaths and non-fatal serious adverse events
of 17 open studies were similar to those of randomized controlled trials. Moreover,
serious adverse events of allogenic cells were greater than autologous preparations,
as shown by frequency, OR and RD.
Conclusions: We conclude that either infusion or instillation of mesenchymal
stem stromal or progenitor cells are well tolerated without serious adverse events
causally related to cell treatment. Cell therapy has not been associated with significant
changes in spirometry, immune function, cardiovascular activity, and the quality of
life.

INTRODUCTION

COPD account for approximately 11.2% and rank top
three leading causes of all deaths globally, in particular
in low-income countries. Because of the need for better
therapeutics, several preclinical studies have examined
the benefit of different stem cell preparations, providing
support for the clinical trials of cell therapy [2-7].
However, clinical trials are predominately phase 1 and
heterogeneous in the source, preparation, route, dose,
duration, variables of outcome, and the nature of diseases.
Also, the small number of patients enrolled in each of
these clinical trials makes it difficult to evaluate safety and
tolerance based on a single trial alone.

Acute inflammatory and chronic fibrotic lung
diseases have a high mortality and morbidity worldwide,
including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1],
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH), silicosis, sarcoidosis, extensively
drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDRTB), chronic obstructive
pulmonary diseases (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF). In spite of considerable advances in our
understanding of pathogenesis and interventional strategy,
among these heterogenic diseases, lung infection and

RESULTS

Previous systematic review and meta-analyses of
the safety and efficacy of cell therapy mainly focused
on adult multipotent mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells
(MSCs) in animal studies [2-8] or induced hematopoietic
stem cell transplantations. MSCs may have therapeutic
value for ARDS, COPD, IPF, BPD, and PAH, especially
with the scarcity of viable pharmacologic but supportive
managements [2-7]. However, significant concerns of the
safety of cell-based therapy still exist with limited data
from clinical studies.
Whether cell therapy worsens the clinical conditions
and causally relates to serious adverse events (SAEs) are
inconclusive because there are not enough phase 2 trials
to date. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review and
meta-analyses to evaluate and summarize the safety of cell
therapy in addition to clinical variables critically for these
lung disorders.

Study characteristics
We collected data from those studies with
fully published articles available. The hits from the
aforementioned databases of individual reviewer were
finally pooled (Figure 1). We analyzed 23 clinical studies
of pulmonary diseases: 1) acute lung injury (eight studies,
90 cases), including ARDS (five studies, 37 cases), BPD/
RDS of premature infants (two studies, 23 cases), and
XDRTB (one study, 30 cases); 2) chronic fibrotic lung
injury, including IPF (three studies, 31 cases), silicosis
(four studies, 20 cases), COPD (four studies, 77 cases),
and sarcoidosis (one study, four cases); and 3) PAH (three

eNOS transfection and low level laser irradiation were
applied in two studies, respectively. Over-expression of
HGF by transfection in BM-MSCs was carried out in three
studies. The dose for single infusion/instillation was from
1~200 × 106 cells in total or 0.2 ~ 10 × 106/kg body weight
per patient. Up to 5 infusions per patient were given. In
total, 399 deliveries were performed, either intravenously
(342) or intratracheally (57). Two studies followed up to
one month or less, ten studies examined patients from two
to nine months, and eleven trials visited patients from one
to three years. In general, the majority of clinical trials
(17 reports) delivered stem cells adjunct with standard or
supportive treatments (Table 1).

studies, 51 cases). Seventeen studies were phase 1a/b,
three were phase 2, and three were case series. The profile
of included studies is summarized in Table 1. Among
them, seven studies were performed in China, three in
USA, three in Brazil, two in each of these two countries
(Sweden and Korea), and one per country from Russia,
Netherland, Canada, Australia, Greece, and Poland.
Fifteen studies were registered on the ClinicalTrials.org
or other databases. There were four randomized controlled
trials (RCT), two nonrandomized trials with controls
(nRCT), four dose-escalating trials, six case series, and
thirteen open label trials. There were 174 Caucasians, 94
Asians, and five Africans (in total 273 patients, 140 males
and 124 females identified). The age ranged from seven
day-old pre-term infants to 86 year-old adults, with an
average of 43.8 ± 20.7y.

Fatal adverse events (death)

Cell characteristics

All 23 studies considered adverse events (AEs) as
primary outcomes. Six studies (three were phase 2 trials)
with controls compared all cause-related AEs of cell
therapy group with those of controls treated with placebo
[9-14]. The frequency of total deaths for any causes of cell
recipients was 57 per 1,000, for 4 deaths of 70 patients
treated with stem cells were reported (Figure 2A). Eleven
deaths of 89 controls were registered with an incidence
rate of 124 per 1,000. The odds ratio (OR) of cell therapy
and control groups was insignificant, 0.31 (95% CI: 0.03,
3.76) (Table 2). Moreover, we calculated risk difference
(RD) between two groups (Figure 2B). A RD value of
-0.13 (-0.32, 0.06) for total deaths was obtained, indicating
that cell infusions may reduce 32 deaths or increase 6
deaths per 100. We further analyzed the deaths for ARDS
and COPD patients separately. The death rate for ARDS
was 4% for cell therapy and 22% for controls. However,
neither OR (0.1 (95% CI: 0.00, 2.06)) nor RD (-0.25 (95%
CI: -0.65, 0.15)) was significant (Table 2). The frequency
of deaths for COPD was 100 per 1,000 for treatment group

Mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs) were
tested in several studies, including bone marrow derived
BM-MSCs in 12 studies (three with allogenic and nine
with autologous MSCs), adipose-derived AD-MSCs in
one study, placenta derived-MSCs in two studies, and
human umbilical cord-derived UBC-MSCs in three
studies. Autologous endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)
were used in three studies, and stem cell-containing
whole umbilical cord blood was applied in one study.
Allogenic MSCs were used for nine trials: six for ARDS,
one for COPD, one for IPF, and one for sarcoidosis.
Autologous MSC/progenitor cells were for 14 trials: one
for BPD, one for TB, three for COPD, four for silicosis,
two for IPF, and three for PAH. These stem cells were
preconditioned by cultured in medium supplemented
with serum and growth factors (e.g., EGF, FGF, VEGF,
HGF) in ten studies and analyzed platelet in two studies.

and 62 per 1,000 for controls. Similar to those of ARDS
studies, the OR and RD values were insignificant (Table
2). Because there were no deaths in children, the frequency
of deaths for adults was thus slightly higher for both
cell therapy (71 per 1,000) and controls (177 per 1,000)
compared with those of pooled deaths. In contrast, the OR
value was identical to that of total deaths of adults and
children, and a RD value of -0.22 (95% CI: -0.53, 0.09)
was derived (Table 2). For all of deaths were considered
as cell therapy-unrelated by the authors, we cannot further

analyse cell therapy-caused deaths during the follow-up
periods.

Non-fatal SAE
The frequency of total non-fatal serious adverse
events (SAEs) was 186 per 1,000 for cell therapy and 169
per 1,000 for controls (Table 3). The OR of total non-fatal
SAEs was 1.53 (95% CI: 0.57, 4.09), indicating that the
probability of non-fatal SAEs for cell therapy was 1.5 fold

that of controls (Figure 3A). The RD value was 0.04 (95%
CI: -0.07, 0.16), indicating that cell therapy would have
70 less or 160 more non-fatal SAEs per 1,000 (Figure
3B). ARDS recipients had a greater frequency of non-fatal
SAEs (240 per 1,000) compared with controls (220 per
1,000) (Table 3). The corresponding OR and RD values
were not statistically significant. However, the frequency
of non-fatal SAEs for COPD recipients was 1.3 fold (233
per 1,000) that of controls (188 per 1,000). This led to
a 45 more non-fatal SAEs per 1,000 in COPD patients
receiving cell therapy (Table 3). We then compared non-

fatal SAEs between adults and children. The frequency
of adults recipients was 125 per 1,000, 1.3 fold that of
controls (97 per 1,000). Cell therapy would reduce 100
or add 150 non-fatal SAEs per 1,000 for adult COPD
patients (Table 3). Similarly, children recipients also
showed a greater frequency of non-fatal SAEs (429 per
1,000) over that of controls (333 per 1,000), resulting in
an OR value of 2.00 (95% CI: 0.38, 10.58) and a RD value
of 0.11 (95% CI: -0.16, 0.38) (Table 3). Because most of
these non-fatal SAEs were therapy-unrelated, and the OR
and RD values were insignificant statistically, non-fatal

and RD values were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.15, 3.18) and -0.12
(95% CI: -0.37, 0.13), respectively. For ARDS and COPD
patients treated with stem cells, the frequency of total
SAEs was 280 per 1,000 and 333 per 1,000, less or greater
than controls (for ARDS 439 per 1,000; (for COPD 250
per 1,000). The derived OR value was 0.34 for ARDS and
1.50 for COPD. There were 196 total SAEs per 1,000 for
cell recipients and 274 total SAEs per 1,000 for controls
in adults. Children showed an identical frequency with
non-fatal SAEs for both treatment and control group.
Insignificant OR and RD values were computed. Although
the OR values for some total SAEs were above 1.0, the
causality between all reported total SAEs and cell therapy
may not exist.

SAE of phase 1 trials
We also analyzed SAEs in 17 open trials. Five of
these 17 studies did not find any AEs [15-19]. Unrelated
deaths were reported in four of 17 observational studies
[20-23]. Three ARDS patients died of multi-organ failure
on day 9, 31, and 118 after cell administrations, which
were reviewed and not related to cell treatments10,12. One
PAH patient collapsed suddenly after discharge who had
a history of recurrent presyncope and frequent admission
for heart failure28. This patient had lowest cardiac output
and highest pulmonary resistance. The general reactions
to infusions, most often fever, were described in seven
studies [23-29].

Laboratory tests and clinical variables

Comparison of SAEs between controlled and
open-labeled trials

In addition to AEs aforementioned, cell therapy may
affect laboratory tests and clinical variables. We analyzed
the mean differences (MD) for spirometry, including
FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC (Table 4). The difference
between cell therapy and controls was not significant (p
= 0.42) with a MD value of 0.09 (95% CI: -0.13, 0.31).
Similarly, we did not see the significant difference

The question raised is whether there were any
differences in SAEs between controlled and open-labeled
studies. Therefore, we computed frequency, OR, and RD
of SAEs between these two types of studies (Tables 5-6).
To cross validate these computations, Peto OR and risk
ratio (RR) were also calculated for sensitivity analysis.

ARDS, COPD, and PAH together were 170 and 243
per 1,000 (Table 5). Moreover, the frequency of deaths
for uncontrolled studies was 128 vs 57 per 1,000 for
controlled studies. Non-fatal SAEs were 43 and 186 per
1,000 for open and RCT trials, respectively. The values
of OR, Peto OR, RD, and RR did not show a significant
changes for both total SAEs (p = 0.35) and deaths (p =
0.19). In contrast, the risk of non-fatal SAEs for controlled
studies was 4-5 fold that of uncontrolled studies (p = 0.04).
Furthermore, we compared total SAEs, deaths, and nonfatal SAEs between six controlled and 17 uncontrolled
studies for either ARDS, COPD, or PAH separately. The
differences between controlled and uncontrolled studies
in the frequency of total SAEs (243 vs 333 per 1,000,
p = 0.78), deaths (40 vs 250 per 1,000, p = 0.09), and
non-fatal SAEs (240 vs 83 per 1,000, p = 0.28) for ARDS
were insignificant as reflected by OR, Peto OR, RD, and
RR values (Supplement 1). For COPD, one controlled
study reported total SAEs (333 per 1,000), deaths (100
per 1,000), and non-fatal SAEs (233 per 1,000)19. In sharp
contrast, three uncontrolled did not report any SAEs [1517]. Significant differences were found in total SAEs and
non-fatal SAEs but not deaths (Table 6). Further, we did
not see marked variance in sex (p = 0.66) and race (p =
0.78) between controlled and open COPD studies. We
also compared SAEs between one controlled [13] and two
open-labeled studies [18, 21] for PAH (Supplement 2).
Interestingly, none of SAEs was reported in the controlled
study [13]. However, the frequency of total SAEs (200
per 1,000), deaths (150 per 1,000), and non-fatal SAEs
(50 per 1,000) were described in uncontrolled studies [18,
21]. A significant RD value of -0.20 (95% CI: -0.40, 0.00,
p = 0.04) was found but not OR, Peto OR, and RR, nor for
deaths and non-fatal SAEs.
We finally tried to compare the potential
contributions of preconditioning/programming and
timing. Unfortunately, there were insufficient summarized
and individual data to perform these analyses or few data
available to obtain meaningful results.

therapies may have value in the treatment for most of
common heterogenic lung disorders, including ARDS,
COPD, IPF, PAH, silicosis, sarcoidosis, BPD, and
pulmonary TRXTB. However, there are insufficient data
from phase 2 or 3 trials to analyze the efficacy of cell
therapy on each individual respiratory disease. To date,
several clinical trials have been completed to address
safety. These clinical trials are phase 1 in design with
diverse route, source, preconditioning, timing, dose,
duration, experimental design, and acute and chronic
pulmonary conditions [2-7]. In addition, these studies
enrolled a small number of patients, or were even just case
reports. It is important to summarize available clinical data
to draw valuable clues for the toxicity and potential sideeffects of cell therapy. To our knowledge, this analysis of
23 clinical trials represents the first such study to review
and analyze pooled data regarding acute and chronic
adverse events and potential toxicity for cell-based
therapy of the respiratory diseases. This study provides a
comprehensive assessment of safety outcomes, including
SAEs, variables for the quality of life, spirometry, immune
function, cardiopulmonary circulation, and gas exchange
for cell-based therapy.
Our results of meta-analysis support the
investigators’ conclusions of included clinical trials that
SAEs were not causally related to cell-based therapy.
The overall OR value for total SAEs from six RCT
studies suggests that stem cell therapy is well tolerated
with few nonspecific infusion-related reactions. These
observations are consistent with the conclusions drawn
from the preclinical studies in animal models [2, 4-7].
Of note, the frequency of death in two ARDS studies
was numerically less than control, indicating cell therapy
may not at least accelerate deterioration of lung diseases.
The diversities in age, race, sex, source, preconditioning/
programming, route, dose, and disease conditions between
included 23 studies suggest cell therapy is well-tolerant
and feasible. The safety and tolerance of cell therapy were
further supported by our analyses of clinical variables.
All of parameters for the quality of life, spirometry,
cardiopulmonary function, immune system, and gas
exchange are not worsen dramatically.
Well-designed randomized controlled trials

maximally limit potential variances associated with
the procedures for stem cell preparation and therapy,
allocation of patients, and conditions of patients. We
thus compared open label and RCT trials. There are no
significant differences in total SAEs, mortality, and
non-fatal SAEs as shown by OR, Peto OR, RD, and RR
analyses between controlled and uncontrolled studies
for patients receiving cell therapy, except for non-fatal
SAEs. Analyses by diseases identifies COPD patients in
one RCT study [9] showed a significant more total SAEs,
most likely caused by more non-fatal SAEs compared to
those of three uncontrolled studies [15-17]. These studies
included patients with similar age and gender, used
the same route (i.v.), and followed up from 1-3 years.
However, the RCT study applied four doses of allogenic
MSCs, while one or two doses of autologous MSCs were
infused in three uncontrolled studies. Additional data are
required to test whether diverse dose or source causes
more non-fatal SAEs in COPD is unknown.
Potential death in animal models of ALI treated
with MSCs was systematically reviewed [3]. A significant
reduction in the overall odds of death was reported
compared to diseased controls without substantial
heterogeneity. This decrease in the OD of death was not
dependent on pre-specified death time points, gender
and species, ALI experimental model, MSC origin and
source, route of administration, and MSC preparation.
These results are consistent, at least partially with
our conclusions drawn from included clinical trials.
Unfortunately, other SAEs were not described in the
preclinical studies.
Our analysis of overall cell-treated patients from
both RCT and open studies suggest that less SAEs, deaths,
and non-fatal SAEs are found in patients treated with
autologous cells. Because most of reported SAEs were
not considered as caused by cell therapy, the reasons for
this difference need additional well-designed RCT trials
to investigate. If route and dose alter the incidence and
mortality of SAEs is still an open question.
Our analysis has several strengths. We had access
to data for more than 273 patients receiving cell infusions
systematically or instillations intratracheally. We analyzed
case series to avoid limitations of literature-based review.
We studied clinically relevant subpopulations (e.g.,
diagnosis, study design, variable, and duration of follow
up). We ensured generalization by including studies
composed of Americans, Asians, Europeans, Australians,
and Africans. To avoid the derivations associated with
source, route, culture, gene expression modulation, and
dose, we pooled data and analyzed overall alterations. In
addition, we crossly validated our analysis with multiple
computing models, statistical software, and both metaanalysis and meta-regression.
There are limitations in this study. Studies included
in this meta-analysis differed in their methods of
recruitment and data collection, and in the preparations
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of cells, which may explain the heterogeneity between
included trials. Nevertheless, we obtained similar results
between Peto OR and M-H OR, RR and RD, suggesting
the association of cell therapy and safety outcomes is
valid. The lack of data regarding the timing and the large
range in the duration of follow up might introduce some
biases, although the effect is likely to be small. 17 of 23
trials are open labeled without controls, which increases
the potential for bias in administration of the intervention
and ascertainment of participant-reported outcomes
(e.g., clinical scores). Bias may also come from pooling
different diseases to compare SAEs associated with route,
source, age, gender, and dose. However, by comparable
analyses of open-labeled trials with RCT studies or
performing sensitivity analyses, we did not identify
significant changes in the results. We cannot exclude the
differences in SAEs associated with race, age, and gender,
but there are insufficient data to compare the contributions
of these variables. In addition, there may be fake and false
information on the SAEs due to the conflict of interest
between the sponsor of clinical trials and patients. More
regulatory mechanisms should exist for each trial to
register and report SAEs, in particular deaths. Given all
most all of these 23 studies included are phase I, which
was focusing on the safety, feasibility, and tolerance with
few patients, there are insufficient data from phase 2 trials
to evaluate the efficacy of stem cells on each respiratory
disease.
In conclusion, our study show that independent of
the nature of lung diseases and the cell-based therapy,
this study suggests that cell therapies may be safe and do
not worsen gas exchange, spirometry, the quality of life,
cardiopulmonary circulation, and immune system of lung
diseases. Deaths of ARDS patients treated with MSC cells
are numerically less than controls. Our results support the
need for phase 2 and 3 clinical trials to evaluate the longterm impact on these respiratory diseases. Phase 2 and
3 trials will also provide more information on safety of
individual cell therapy approaches, doses, and sources in
different acute and chronic pulmonary diseases that cannot
be adequately assessed in phase 1 trials alone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted our systematic review and metaanalyses in accordance with the methods recommended in
the PRISMA guidelines.

Selection of clinical trials
Three independent investigators searched the
potential studies in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase,
Cochrane Library, CNKI, and ClinicalTrials.org by July
2016, using the search strategy: (lung OR respiratory OR
pulmonary OR airway OR bronchial OR bronchiectasis
30519

OR bronchitis OR pneumonia OR silicosis OR asthma
OR ALI OR ARDS OR COPD OR cystic fibrosis OR
bronchiolitis OR bronchopulmonary dysplasia OR
emphysema OR pneumocystosis) AND (safety [TI] OR
trial [TI]) AND (stem [TI] OR cell therapy [TI] OR cellbased [TI] OR cellular [TI] OR mesenchymal [TI] OR
stromal [TI] OR progenitor [TI]). When the conflicts over
inclusions appeared, Dr. Ji was consulted. Our search
was not limited by language, race, age, sex, route, study
design, phase, and preparation of cells. Two functions of
PubMed, “Similar articles” and “Cited by PubMed Central
articles” were applied to find additional studies.

full articles, absence of detail results and methods, and
those reporting therapy for cell transplantation-induced
disorders.

Bias of the included studies
Publication bias between selected studies was
detected with the visual symmetry of funnel plots [32]
(Supplement 3). Other biases were assessed by bias
evaluation table provided by the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Supplements 4-5).
All of the bias in four studies [9, 10, 13, 14] were low risk.
The bias of random sequence generation and allocation
concealment were high risk in four studies [26, 28, 29,
31]and unknown in other studies while other bias were
low risk in all studies. Other biases were assessed using
RevMan according to Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions. Of note, there are no regulatory
mechanisms for each individual trial to control and report
true data of SAEs.

Data extraction
Both individual patient-level data and summarized
estimates were extracted by ZLS and HLJ, as we described
previously [30]. The marked data were used in metaanalysis. For case series [12, 15-17, 20, 21, 23, 27, 31],
we combined individual data using the formulas,
and

mean of pooled individual data, and

size. To combine data of subgroups, mean and SD were
computed with these equations:

The total cells received per patients were computed
as the product of cells per delivery and the total times. If
cells were given per body weight, the total amount of cells
was the product of single dose, body weight (60kg), and
how many times delivered. Both the association of total
cells delivered and total SAEs (Supplement 6) as well as
deaths was computed with Stata and software R.

and

, where N and M represent
the size and mean of subgroup, respectively. If the data
was represented as mean and standard error (SE) [12,
21], SE values were converted to SD by this function,

Statistical analysis

For the studies reporting baseline
values and net changes in variables [9, 13, 21], we
calculated absolute changes using RevMan v5.3. For
variables without SD [19, 25], SD value of similar studies
for the same parameter was borrowed. If we only know
the percent change from baseline [9], then we got the
baseline values from other study about the same disease
as reference. When we analysis in subgroup of disease,
the baseline value and the minimum or maximum value
after cell therapy was collected, and only the value of cell
therapy group (CTG) was used in studies with controls.
On the other hand, when we analysis in subgroup of study
design, then the value of change from baseline was used
in studies with controls.
All eligible studies met the following criteria.
Patients were clinically diagnosed with pulmonary
diseases, including ALI/ARDS, COPD, IPF, BPD,
silicosis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and PAH.
The transplanted cells were cells with no restrictions in
terms of origin, dose, preconditioning/programming,
and route. Publications were original studies. Outcomes
were safety and tolerance that were expressed or could
be converted or digitized to mean ± SD. The following
studies were excluded: conference abstracts or unavailable
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

All 23 studies were included for systematic reviews
of characteristics of populations. The adverse events
(AEs) were grouped by total SAEs, death, and non-fatal
SAEs according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE). Multiple SAEs of
one patient counted once. We compared the frequency
of incidence rate, Peto OR, RD, and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI) using either ﬁxed-effects or randomeffects model. The Mantel-Haenszel OR and RR were
used for the sensitivity analyses. The potential sideeffects of cell therapy on laboratory and clinical variables
were computed as MD and 95% CI using RevMan v5.3.
Heterogeneity of extracted data was assessed with the
Cochran’s Q statistic as the p value and I-square statistic
(I2) in the pooled analyses, representing the percentage of
total variation between studies [32]. If the p value was less
than 0.05, or the I2 value was greater than 50%, overall
estimates were analyzed with the random-effects model.
Otherwise, the fixed-effects model was applied. If the p
value is significantly different in random-effects model
and fixed-effects model, we selected random-effects

was less than but near 50%. To compute differences in
AEs and alterations in laboratory and clinical assays
between controlled and uncontrolled studies, we
performed χ2 tests and two-sample t-test. Furthermore,
we compared the potential differences in these variables
between six controlled and 17 noncontrolled studies. To
compare differences in SAEs caused by route, source,
preconditioning/reprogramming, and dose, we computed
