ABSTRACT
Alectinib is a new generation ALK inhibitor with activity against the gatekeeper
L1196M mutation that showed remarkable activity in a phase I/II study with
echinoderm microtubule associated protein-like 4 (EML4) - anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, alectinib
resistance may eventually develop. Here, we found that EGFR ligands and HGF,
a ligand of the MET receptor, activate EGFR and MET, respectively, as alternative
pathways, and thereby induce resistance to alectinib. Additionally, the heat shock
protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor suppressed protein expression of ALK, MET, EGFR, and
AKT, and thereby induced apoptosis in EML4-ALK NSCLC cells, even in the presence
of EGFR ligands or HGF. These results suggest that Hsp90 inhibitors may overcome
ligand-triggered resistance to new generation ALK inhibitors and may result in more
successful treatment of NSCLC patients with EML4-ALK.

INTRODUCTION

G1202R, S1206Y, 1151-T-ins, and G1269A) [7, 8, 9, 10],
ALK amplification [7], and activation of bypass signals
via activation of other receptors (KIT amplification
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
autophosphorylation ) [8]. We recently reported that
receptor ligands, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF),
heparin binding-epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF),
and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) , also activate
EGFR as a bypass signal and induce crizotinib resistance
in EML4-ALK NSCLC cells [11].
Alectinib is a highly selective, new generation ALKTKI that also has inhibitory activity against EML4-ALK
NSCLC cells with the gatekeeper L1196M mutation [12].
In a clinical trial for crizotinib-treatment naïve NSCLC
patients with ALK rearrangement, there was a response
rate of 93.5% to alectinib [13]. Moreover, alectinib
demonstrated promising effects, even in the crizotinibtreated NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangement [14].
While it is clear that resistance may also develop against
this class of inhibitor, the mechanisms of resistance to
alectinib are largely unknown.
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular
chaperone that plays a central role in regulating the

Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) can
be classified into distinct molecular subsets based on
specific genomic alterations that drive tumorigenesis
[1]. ALK rearrangement, most commonly EML4 -ALK, is
detected in approximately 3–7% of unselected NSCLCs
[2, 3]. EML4-ALK NSCLC is more frequently observed
in patients with adenocarcinoma than with other diseases ,
in young adults than in older patients, and in non-smokers
or light smokers (<15 packs/year) than in heavier smokers
[4]. Crizotinib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
of ALK, MET, and ROS1, is the only agent that has been
approved for ALK-rearranged NSCLC. It shows dramatic
clinical efficacy, with a response rate of about 60–80% and
a progression free survival (PFS) of approximately 9–10
months in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients [5]. However,
almost all patients who strongly responded to crizotinib
acquired resistance to these agents after varying periods
of time [6].
Known mechanisms for resistance to crizotinib
include the gatekeeper L1196M mutation [6], other
secondary ALK gene mutations (F1174L, C1156Y,

RESULTS

correct folding, stability, and function of numerous “client
proteins,” including human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2), BRAF , mutant EGFR, and EML4ALK, Bcr-Abl, Raf-1, which are required for cancer cell
survival [15, 16, 17, 18]. Hsp90 inhibition is therefore
thought to be a promising strategy for controlling tumors,
including those of EML4-ALK NSCLC. A natural
product, geldanamycin, was found to directly bind to the
ATP-binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of Hsp90
and block the binding of nucleotides to Hsp90; hence,
geldanamycin was found to inhibit Hsp90 function.
The first water-soluble, semi-synthetic derivative of
geldanamycin is 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) , which has shown
excellent bioavailability and is quantitatively metabolized
much less than other geldanamycin derivatives, such as
17-Allylamino 17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)
[19, 20].
In the present study, we examined whether receptor
ligands would trigger resistance to a highly selective
ALK-TKI, alectinib. Additionally, since we previously
demonstrated that the Hsp90 inhibitor overcame EGFRTKI resistance triggered by HGF, a ligand of MET, in
EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells [21], we determined
whether Hsp90 inhibition by 17-DMAG would overcome
ligand-triggered alectinib resistance in ALK-rearranged
NSCLC cells.

Exogenously added HGF and EGFR ligands
induce resistance to alectinib in EML4-ALK
NSCLC cells
Two EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines, H2228 and
H3122, were sensitive to crizotinib (IC50 0.3 µmol/L and
0.06 µmol/L, respectively). These cell lines were also
sensitive to alectinib (IC50 0.24 µmol/L and 0.03 µmol/L,
respectively). Exogenously added HGF and EGFR ligands
(EGF, HB-EGF, and TGF-α) slightly stimulated cell
growth, as determined by cell counting (Supplementary
Fig. 1), and increased cell viability was determined
by MTT assay (Fig. 1A-B). Under these experimental
conditions, HGF and EGFR ligands remarkably reduced
susceptibility of H2228 and H3122 cells to alectinib.

17-DMAG inhibits the viability of EML4-ALK
NSCLC cells, irrespective of the presence of
exogenously added HGF or EGFR ligands
Only the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG inhibited the
viability of H2228 (Fig. 1C) and H3122 (Fig. 1D) cells

Figure 1: 17-DMAG suppresses the growth of EML4-ALK NSCLC cells in the presence of HGF and EGFR ligands.

The EML4-ALK lung cancer cell lines human H2228 and human H3122 were treated with increasing concentrations of alectinib or
17-DMAG, with or without HGF (50 ng/mL), EGF (100 ng/mL), HB-EGF (10 ng/mL), and TGF-α (100 ng/mL), and cell viability was
determined after 72 h by MTT assay. Data shown are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard

in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, 17-DMAG
inhibited the viability of H2228 and H3122 cells, even
in the presence of HGF or EGFR ligands. These results
suggest that 17-DMAG may overcome alectinib resistance
triggered by HGF or EGFR ligands, such as EGF, HBEGF, and TGF-α.

transfected with vector alone . H2228/HGF cells secreted
high concentrations of HGF (16.0 ± 0.4 ng/mL), whereas
the HGF concentrations secreted by H2228 and H2228/
Vec cells were under the detection limit. Consistent with
the results of exogenously added HGF, HGF-transfected
H2228 (H2228/HGF) cells became insensitive to alectinib
(Fig. 2A), indicating that endogenously-expressed HGF
also induced resistance to alectinib in EML4-ALK
NSCLC cells.
We further found that 17-DMAG inhibited the
growth of both H2228/Vec and H2228/HGF cells, because
each had an IC50 of 0.01 µmol/L (Fig. 2B). These findings
indicate that 17-DMAG may overcome alectinib resistance
triggered by endogenously-produced HGF.

17-DMAG inhibits the viability of EML4-ALK
NSCLC cells in the presence of endogenous HGF
Recently, HGF was reported to induce resistance
to various molecular-targeted drugs in various types of
cancers with oncogene drivers [22, 23]. Moreover, our
previous study reported that HGF was overexpressed in
the EGFR mutant cancer cells that acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKIs, indicating endogenous HGF production by
cancer cells [24]. These findings suggest that HGF can be
overexpressed in EML4-ALK NSCLC cells that acquire
resistance to ALK inhibitors.
Therefore, we next examined whether endogenously
expressed HGF induced alectinib resistance in EML4ALK NSCLC cells. To assess this question, we generated
stable HGF-gene transfectants in H2228 cells (H2228/
HGF); as a control, we generated H2228/Vec cells

HGF reduces alectinib susceptibility via MET
phosphorylation, and 17-DMAG reduces
expression of ALK and MET
To explore the molecular mechanism by which HGF
reduced susceptibility to alectinib and 17-DMAG inhibited
cell growth, even in the presence of HGF, we examined
the protein expression and phosphorylation status of
MET, ALK, and their downstream molecules (PI3K/AKT,
ERK1/2, and STAT3) by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Since

HGF reduced alectinib susceptibility more potently in
H2228 compared with H3122 cells (Fig. 1A-B), we mainly
used H2228 cells in the following experiments. H2228
(data not shown) and H2228/Vec (Fig. 3) cells expressed
ALK and MET proteins (ALK were phosphorylated but
MET were not), as well as the downstream molecules
AKT, ERK1/2, and STAT3. In the absence of HGF,
alectinib inhibited ALK phosphorylation, thereby
inhibiting AKT, ERK1/2, and STAT3 phosphorylation.
In the presence of HGF, alectinib failed to inhibit
MET, AKT, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, although it
inhibited ALK and STAT3 phosphorylation. These results
suggest that HGF reduced susceptibility to alectinib by
mainly restoring AKT and ERK1/2 pathways via MET
activation.
In parallel experiments, 17-DMAG decreased
the expression of ALK and MET proteins and inhibited
their phosphorylation and AKT, ERK1/2, and STAT3
phosphorylation, irrespective of HGF presence. Similar
results were observed in H2228/HGF (Fig. 3) and H3122
cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results indicate that
17-DMAG decreases protein expression of ALK and
MET, thereby suppressing downstream signaling and
overcoming alectinib resistance caused by HGF.

molecules in H2228 cells stimulated with EGFR ligands
(Fig. 4). H2228 expressed EGFR, but EGFR was not
constitutively phosphorylated in our experimental
conditions. The EGFR ligands EGF, HB-EGF, and
TGF-α remarkably induced EGFR phosphorylation. In
these experimental conditions, alectinib failed to inhibit
phosphorylation of EGFR or downstream AKT and
ERK1/2, while it inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation. These
results suggest that EGFR ligands reduced susceptibility to
alectinib mainly by restoring AKT and ERK1/2 pathways
via EGFR activation.
On the other hand, 17-DMAG decreased EGFR
protein expression, resulting in inhibition of AKT,
ERK1/2, and STAT3 phosphorylation, irrespective of
the presence of EGFR ligands. These results suggest that
17-DMAG decreases EGFR protein expression, thereby
suppressing downstream signaling and overcoming
alectinib resistance triggered by EGFR ligands.

17-DMAG induces apoptosis of EML4-ALK lung
cancer cells, even in the presence of HGF
We next assessed whether alectinib and 17-DMAG
induced H2228/Vec cell apoptosis in the absence or
presence of HGF. Alectinib induced apoptosis of H2228/
Vec cells in the absence, but not presence, of HGF (Fig.
5). In contrast, 17-DMAG induced apoptosis in both
the presence and absence of HGF. In a similar fashion,
17-DMAG, but not alectinib, induced H2228/HGF cell
apoptosis.

17-DMAG reduces EGFR and AKT protein
expression and inhibits downstream pathways,
even in the presence of EGFR ligands
We also examined the protein expression and
phosphorylation status of EGFR and its downstream

17-DMAG inhibits H2228 cell viability, even in
the presence of both of HGF and EGFR ligands
Since several growth factors can be simultaneously
produced in cancer microenvironments [25, 26], it is
possible that HGF and EGFR ligands are co-expressed
in EML4-ALK NSCLC cells . Crizotinib inhibits MET,
ALK, and ROS1, and it is supposed to overcome alectinib
resistance caused by HGF alone. We therefore examined
the effect of 17-DMAG compared with crizotinib in the
presence of HGF plus EGFR ligands. H2228 and H3122
cells became insensitive to alectinib in the presence of
HGF, TGF-α, and HGF with TGF-α (Fig. 6). These cells
were sensitive to crizotinib in the presence of HGF, but
they became much less sensitive to crizotinib in the
presence of TGF-α with or without HGF. However, H2228
and H3122 were sensitive to 17-DMAG in the presence of
HGF, TGF-α, or HGF with TGF-α. These results suggest
that 17-DMAG may overcome alectinib resistance, even in
the presence of ligands for two different receptors.

Figure 4: 17-DMAG reduced MET protein expression
and inhibited downstream pathways, even in the
presence of EGFR ligands. H2228 cells were treated with or

without alectinib (0.3 μmol/L) for 2 h or 17-DMAG (0.3 μmol/L)
for 24 h, and then stimulated with or without EGF (100 ng/mL),
HB-EGF (10 ng/mL), and TGF-α (100 ng/mL) for 10 min.
The resultant cells were lysed, and the indicated proteins were
detected by immunoblotting. Data shown are representative of at
least 3 independent experiments.

EGFR (EGF, HB-EGF, and TGF-α) triggered resistance
to alectinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells, and that
the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG overcame the resistance
triggered by these receptor ligands. 17-DMAG inhibited
protein levels of ALK, EGFR, and MET, even in the
presence of ligand activation, and suppressed of AKT and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation, thereby inducing apoptosis of
ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells, irrespective of the presence
of HGF or EGFR ligands. Since the Hsp90 inhibitor by
itself could inhibit both driver (from rearranged ALK) and
resistance signals (from activated receptors; MET and
EGFR), it may be an ideal agent for overcoming ligandtriggered alectinib resistance in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.
Activation of bypass signals is a common resistance
mechanism for targeted drugs. For example, EGFR-TKI
resistance could be caused by MET amplification [27],
HGF-triggered MET activation [23], Gas6-triggered AXL
activation [28], and HER2 amplification [29] in EGFR
mutant lung cancer. BRAF inhibitor resistance could be
caused by HGF-triggered MET activation [30], and IGF1 triggered its receptor activation [31] in BRAF mutant
melanoma. Crizotinib resistance could be caused by EGFR
ligand-triggered EGFR activation [11], and stem cell
factor (SCF)-triggered amplified cKIT activation [8] in
EML4-ALK NSCLC. Therefore, HGF and EGFR ligands
may be common resistance triggers that activate bypass
survival signal via their receptor activation. The results
in the present study are consistent with previous research
indicating that alectinib resistance was induced by HGF
and EGFR ligands.
Previous studies reported that several signaling
pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK, and STAT3,
are essential for survival and/or resistance to ALK
inhibitors in ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells [12, 32].
Accordingly, we found that alectinib inhibited STAT3
and ALK phosphorylation. In the presence of alectinib,
HGF or EGFR ligands restored AKT and ERK1/2, but not
STAT3, phosphorylation and thereby made EML4-ALK
cells insensitive to alectinib. These observations indicate
that, when activated by their ligands, AKT and ERK
signals from MET or EGFR play pivotal roles in alectinib
resistance of EML4-ALK NSCLC cells.
It is of interest in the present study that HGF and
EGFR ligands induced not only ALK-TKI resistance but
also increased cell growth of EML4-ALK NSCLC cells.
HGF and EGFR ligands also induced morphological
change of H2228 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). Therefore,
these receptor ligands may modulate various cancer
phenotypes of EML4-ALK NSCLC cells. HGF-MET
and EGFR-ligands-EGFR axises play pivotal roles in
progression of various types of tumors (33, 34). We
are planning further studies to explore the molecular
mechanisms of this morphological change and co-relation
between the expression of receptor ligands in patient
specimens and clinical characteristics in ALK-rearranged
NSCLC.

Inter- and/or intra-tumor heterogeneity is a critical
obstacle in cancer therapy with targeted drugs [35].
This is also the case in ALK-TKI resistance. Intratumor heterogeneity caused by crizotinib resistance
results from the L1196M gatekeeper ALK mutation,
and other ALK secondary C1156Y mutations co-existed
in malignant pleural effusion of a patient who acquired
crizotinib resistance [6]. Moreover, activation of different
two receptors, EGFR and amplified KIT (both of which
could induce crizotinib resistance), also co-existed in one
crizotinib-resistant tumor [8].
Hsp90 inhibitors have been reported to overcome
crizotinib resistance caused by several mechanisms,
including ALK amplification, L1196M gatekeeper ALK
mutation, other secondary ALK mutations (including
F1174L), and epithelial to mesenchymal transition.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Hsp90 inhibitor
may overcome alectinib resistance, even when ligands
of MET and EGFR co-exist . A new generation of Hsp90
inhibitors, including ganetespib, has recently been
developed, and remarkable efficacy has been reported
in a co-clinical model and early phase clinical studies
[36]. Therefore, Hsp90 inhibition using new generation
inhibitors may be a promising strategy to treat ALKrearranged NSCLCs that acquire resistance to alectinib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The H2228 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line,
with EML4-ALK fusion protein variant3 (E6;A20),
was purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA ). The H3122 human lung
adenocarcinoma cell line, with EML4-ALK fusion protein
variant1 (E13;A20), was kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey
A. Engelman of the Massachusetts General Hospital
Cancer Center (Boston, MA) [37]. H2228 and H3122
cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/
mL), and streptomycin (50 μg/mL) in a humidified CO2
incubator at 37°C. All cells were passaged for less than 3
months before renewal from frozen, early-passage stocks
obtained from the indicated sources. Cells were regularly
screened for Mycoplasma using a MycoAlert Mycoplasma
Detection Kit (Lonza , Basel, Swiss).

Cell growth assay

Apoptosis assay

Cell proliferation was measured using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl terazolium
bromide (MTT) dye reduction method [39]. Tumor
cells were harvested at 80% confluence, seeded at 2
× 103 cells per well in 96-well plates, and incubated in
appropriate medium for 24 h. Several concentrations of
alectinib, crizotinib, 17-DMAG, and/or EGF, TGF-α, HBEGF, and HGF were added to each well, and incubation
continued for another 72 h. Fifty μL MTT (2 mg/mL;
Sigma, St.Louis, MO) was added to each well, followed
by incubation for 2 h at 37°C. The media were removed
and the dark blue crystals in each well were dissolved
in 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Absorbance
was measured with an MTP-120 Microplate reader
(Corona Electric , Hitachinaka, Ibaraki, Japan) at test and
reference wavelengths of 550 and 630 nm, respectively.
The percentage growth was calculated relative to untreated
controls. Each assay was carried out at least in triplicate,
with results based on 3 independent experiments.

Cell apoptosis induced by alectinib and 17-DMAG
was measured by the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection
Kit I (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) which detects and
quantifies apoptotic cells with phycoerythrin (PE) Annexin
V and 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) staining. Cells
were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,
NJ).

Western blotting
Sodium dodesyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide
gels (Bio-Rad , Hercules, CA) were loaded with 40 μg
total protein per lane; following electrophoresis, the
proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Bio-Rad ), which were incubated with
Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan ) for 1 h at
room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C
with anti-ALK (C26G7), anti-phospho-ALK (Tyr1604),
anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068), anti-STAT3 (79D7),
anti-phospho-STAT3 (Y705), anti-AKT, anti-phosphoAKT (Ser473), anti-ErbB4 (111B2), anti-phospho-ErbB4
(Tyr1284), anti-MET (25H2), anti-phospho-MET (Y1234/
Y1235) (3D7), or anti-β-actin (13E5) antibodies (1:1,000
dilution each; Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers, MA),
or with anti-human EGFR (1 μg/mL), anti-human/mouse/
rat extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/Erk2
(0.2 μg/mL), or anti-phospho-Erk1/Erk2 (T202/Y204)
(0.1 μg/mL) antibodies (R&D Systems ). After washing
3 times, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with secondary antibodies (horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated species-specific antibodies).
Immunoreactive bands were visualized with
SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate
Enhanced Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Osaka,
Japan ). Each experiment was independently carried out
at least 3 times.

HGF-gene transfection
One day before transfection, aliquots of 1 × 105
H2228 cells in 1 mL of antibiotic-free medium were
plated on 6-well plates. The full-length HGF cDNA
cloned into the BCMGSneo expression vector [40] was
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After incubation for 24 h,
the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) and incubated for an additional 72 h in antibioticcontaining medium. Then, the cells were selected in G418
sulfate (Calbiochem, Jolla, CA). After limiting dilution,
the HGF-producing cells, H2228/HGF, were established.
HGF production by H2228/HGF was confirmed by
enzyme linked immunosolvent assay (ELISA) .

HGF production

Statistical analysis

Cells (2 × 105) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
with 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were washed with PBS
and incubated for 48 h in 2 mL of RPMI-1640 medium
with 10% FBS. Then, culture medium was harvested
and centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at –70°C
until analysis. HGF concentrations were determined by
IMMUNIS HGF EIA (Institute of Immunology, Tokyo)
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. All samples
were run in duplicate. Color intensity was measured at
450 nm using a spectrophotometric plate reader. Growth
factor concentrations were determined by comparison with
standard curves, and the HGF detection limit was 100 pg/
mL.
