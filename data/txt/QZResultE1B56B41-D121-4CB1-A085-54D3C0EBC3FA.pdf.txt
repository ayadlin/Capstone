BACKGROUND. Radiotherapy (RT) plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide
(TMZ) is now the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The occurrence of pseudo-progression directly after RT is a recognized
phenomenon, but to the authors’ knowledge its incidence after combined RT/
TMZ is unknown. The occurrence of early pseudo-progression was retrospectively
assessed in a cohort of malignant glioma patients treated with RT/TMZ.

METHODS. The pre-RT and post-RT brain scans from patients treated with RT/
TMZ for a malignant glioma were reviewed. Scans were made before the start of
RT, 4 weeks after the end of RT, and every 3 months thereafter. In addition, infor-

received additional treatment other than TMZ. Six of 18 patients with pseudo-procal signs and symptoms during RT or in the first 4 weeks thereafter.

CONCLUSIONS. Up to 50% of malignant glioma patients treated with RT/TMZ and
progression immediately after RT develop pseudo-progression. The current study
data support the idea to continue TMZ in the case of progressive lesions immediately after RT/TMZ. Surgery should be considered in symptomatic cases. The
inclusion of patients with progressive lesions developing directly after chemoradiation in studies regarding recurrent gliomas will lead to an overestimation of
the results. Cancer 2008;113:405–10.  2008 American Cancer Society.

adiotherapy (RT) and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) followed by adjuvant TMZ has become the standard of care for
patients with glioblastomas since the European and Canadian randomized trial was published in 2005.1 Despite the improved outcome with combined modality treatment, the overall outcome of
this disease remains dismal, with many patients progressing early
after RT or during adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy. In recent years, we
and other clinicians observed the occurrence of progressive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions immediately after the end
of concurrent chemoirradiation with TMZ (RT/TMZ), with spontaneous improvement without further treatment other than adjuvant TMZ. In an earlier study, this phenomenon of early pseudoprogression was investigated in 32 patients with a malignant glioma

who received RT only.2 In that study, 3 of 9 patients
(33%) with a progressive lesion immediately after RT
demonstrated a stabilized or improved lesion during at
least 6 months on subsequent scans, without additional treatment. To our knowledge, the incidence of
early pseudo-progression in malignant glioma patients
treated with RT/TMZ is unknown, nor is it known
whether this is clinically symptomatic. (At the time of
publication, Brandes et al have since published data
regarding the incidence of pseudo-regression and the
correlation with the MGMT promoter methylation status in glioblastoma patients.3) We investigated the incidence of early pseudo-progression and its clinical
features by reviewing a cohort of patients with newly
diagnosed malignant gliomas who were treated with
RT plus concomitant and adjuvant TMZ.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
For this study, all malignant glioma patients treated
between 2000 and July 2006 with RT/TMZ in the
Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center in Rotterdam, The
Netherlands, were reviewed. Furthermore, all patients
who participated in the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22981
study and received chemoirradiation at the University Medical Center Utrecht in Utrecht, The Netherlands, were also reviewed. No patients were
excluded. Treatment was comprised of fractionated
irradiation at a dose of 2.0 grays (Gy) per fraction
given once daily on weekdays over a period of
6 weeks to a total dose of 60 Gy and concomitant
TMZ (75 mg/m2/day on all days), followed after 4
weeks by 6, 28-day cycles of adjuvant TMZ (Day 1–5
every 28 days, at a dose of 150–200 mg/m2/day).
None of the patients received other treatment, such
as gliadel or a focal radiotherapy boost.
Clinical records were reviewed concerning the
type of surgery performed, histology, radiation field,
neurologic signs and symptoms, dexamethasone
dose, and survival. Per treatment protocol, brain imaging was performed before RT (median interval of
14 days between the brain scan and the initiation of
RT), 4 weeks after the end of RT (median interval of
30 days between the end of the RT/concomitant
TMZ), and thereafter every 3 months. Two independent reviewers reviewed all brain scans (HGdB and
WT). The evaluation was based on precontrast and
postcontrast images and primarily on the changes in
the contrast-enhancing area. In the case of disagreement, the scans were jointly re-evaluated. The
response criteria developed by Macdonald et al.4 were
used to quantify all changes in the enhancing lesions
on the scan, clinical status, and dexamethasone dose.

Early disease progression was defined as progression (25% increase) noted on the MRI scan 4 weeks
after RT and concomitant TMZ, with or without neurologic deterioration, and on a stable or higher dose
of dexamethasone. Real early progression was scored
if the patient with early progression developed additional disease progression within the following
6 months. Pseudo-early progression was scored if the
patient with early progression 1) had at least a 50%
decrease in the enhancing lesion during further follow-up, while remaining neurologically stable and on
a stable or decreasing dose of dexamethasone (a
‘partial response’ according to the criteria of Macdonald et al.4) or 2) remained clinically and radiologically stable with a stable or decreased dosage of
steroids for at least 6 months after RT/TMZ without
any further treatment other than adjuvant cycles of
TMZ. Clinical features of the patients with real early
progression and pseudo-early progression were compared. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to analyze survival in the patients with real early
progression and pseudo-early progression.

RESULTS
Eighty-five patients were treated with RT plus concomitant and adjuvant TMZ. The majority of the patients had
a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Table 1 summarizes
the demographic and clinical features of these patients.
In 39 patients, the pre-RT/TMZ scan was a computed
tomography (CT) scan; in the other 46 patients, MRI
was used. All follow-up scans were MRI scans.
Thirty-six of the 85 patients (42%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 31.5–52.5%) were identified
as having early progression on the first follow-up
scan 4 weeks after RT and concomitant TMZ compared with the pre-RT imaging (Table 2). Thirty-one
of the 68 patients (45%; 95% CI, 33.2–56.8%) with a
GBM and 5 of the 17 patients (29%; 95% CI, 7.4–
50.6%) with an anaplastic glioma had early disease

progression. In only 1 patient could the decreased
dose of dexamethasone explain the observed progression noted on the MRI scan (Patient 17). Three
patients did not continue with adjuvant TMZ
because of neurologic deterioration (Patients 22, 31,
and 34). All of the remaining patients continued with
adjuvant TMZ.
Eighteen of 36 patients (50%; 95% CI, 33.7–
66.3%) with early disease progression were diagnosed
with pseudo-early progression. Pseudo–early progression was noted in 15 of the 31 patients (48%; 95% CI,
30.4–65.6%) with a GBM and in 3 of the 5 patients
(60%; 95% CI, 17.0–100%) with an anaplastic glioma.
In 17 of the 36 patients with early disease progression, the enhancing lesion on subsequent MRI scans
stabilized for at least 6 months (Patients 4, 5, 11, 13,
14, and 15), decreased (Patients 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16,
and 18) (Fig. 1), or disappeared completely (Patients
1, 10, and 17). Because these 17 patients were also
clinically stable or improved and were receiving a
stable or decreasing dose of dexamethasone, they
were scored as having pseudo-early progression. One
of the 36 patients with early progression underwent
a re-resection 3 months after RT and concomitant
TMZ because of further deterioration; at surgery,
only necrosis was found (Patient 3). The patient continued with 3 more cycles of adjuvant TMZ and
remained stable for another 15 months.
To investigate whether the percentage of patients
with pseudo-early progression was artificially high
because of the use of a CT scan rather than an MRI
scan before RT, we separately analyzed the patients
diagnosed with early disease progression who had
been evaluated with MRI scans both before and after
RT. In this group, 8 of 17 patients (47%) were subsequently diagnosed with pseudo-early progression
compared with 10 of 19 patients (53%) who had a
pre-RT CT scan.
The individual charts of the patients with
pseudo-early progression were re-examined for other
explanations of disease remission, but none were
found. In particular, no new treatments had been
initiated other than adjuvant TMZ.
Neurologic deterioration was found in 6 of the
18 patients (33%) with pseudo-early progression and
in 12 of the 18 patients (67%) with real early progression during RT or in the first 4 weeks thereafter. The
mean age of the patients with real early progression
was significantly higher compared with that of the
patients with pseudo–early progression (55 years vs
46 years, respectively; P 5 .0342). The World Health
Organization (WHO) performance status was not
found to be significantly different between the
patients with real early progression and those with

scan, the (B) scan of the brain taken 4 weeks after RT/TMZ demonstrated
disease progression within the area of gadolinium uptake. The patient

dose was gradually lowered and withdrawn. (C) The magnetic resonance

found to be significantly different between the

of 26 patients who underwent a biopsy (23%; 95%
CI, 6.8–39.2%) and in 13 of 59 patients who underwent a partial or complete surgical resection (22%;
95% CI, 11.4–32.6%) The extent of surgical resection
could not be taken into consideration because no
direct postoperative scans were made.

DISCUSSION
In the past decades, the sporadic occurrence of early
clinical deterioration with increasing imaging
abnormalities immediately after RT with spontaneous
recovery have been described.5 Since the introduction of chemoirradiation with TMZ for GBM, there
has been an increasing awareness of this phenomenon. From our cohort of 85 patients treated with
chemoirradiation with TMZ, the progressive enhancement was not found to be because of tumor
progression in 18 of the 36 patients (50%) with a progressive lesion at the time of first tumor evaluation
after chemoirradiation. Although the pre-RT/concomitant TMZ scan was a CT scan in approximately
half of these patients, it is unlikely that this influenced the results because the outcome was the same
in patients who underwent an initial MRI scan. In
addition, the patients with pseudo-early progression
were found to have a similar survival compared with
patients without early progression (Fig. 2). A recent
report examining surgery performed within 6 months
from RT/concomitant TMZ in patients with GBM
corroborated our findings regarding the frequency of
nontumoral increase in enhancement.6 In that study,
26 of 51 GBM patients demonstrated disease progression within 6 months after the completion of RT/

409

concomitant TMZ. Fifteen of these 26 patients
underwent surgery again and 7 of them were diagnosed with radiation necrosis.
Although we hypothesized that pseudo–early
progression would occur more frequently after RT/
concomitant TMZ compared with RT only, the incidence we observed (18 of 85 patients [21%]; 95% CI,
12.5–29.9%) is still within the range de Wit et al.2
observed after the use of RT only (3 of 32 patients
[9%]; 95% CI, 20.7–19.5%). One possible explanation
for the increased awareness of the phenomenon of
pseudo–early progression could be that most GBM
patients are now treated with RT/TMZ and therefore
are more closely followed. Conversely, in cell lines,
synergy between TMZ and RT has been demonstrated in MGMT promoter gene methylated tumors.7
It may well be that this synergistic antitumoral effect
causes more profound tumor necrosis and inflammation with vascular changes, leading to a deficient
blood-brain barrier mimicking enhancing tumor on a
scan. Further research will explore whether there is
indeed a correlation between MGMT methylation status and the occurrence of pseudo–early progression.
(At the time of publication, Brandes et al have since
published data regarding the incidence of pseudoregression and the correlation with the MGMT promoter methylation status in glioblastoma patients.3)
The increase in radiation necrosis noted to occur if
chemotherapy is given after RT in patients with brain
tumors also suggests that more intensified treatments cause more severe local reactions.7 This is
also the likely explanation for the earlier occurrence
of radiation necrosis noted after combined chemoirradiation with TMZ.6,8 Most likely, pseudo–early progression and early radiation necrosis are a
continuum, with more severe local reactions leading
to new focal signs and symptoms and true radiation
necrosis.
The precise mechanism of this early post-RT/
concomitant TMZ deterioration is unknown. The
underlying mechanism may be varied and in addition to the above-mentioned radiation-induced (and
perhaps vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]
signaling-dependent) vascular and necrotic changes,
tumor progression during the first part of RT and
subsequent response could also be an explanation.
Although to our knowledge the exact nature of
this pseudo-early progression is unknown, these
observations have important consequences for trials
of recurrent malignant glioma. Of the 36 patients in
the current study with early progression (according
to the response criteria of Macdonald et al.), 3
achieved a complete response and 8 achieved a partial response, whereas 6 fulfilled the criteria for stable

disease at 6 months. Six-month progression-free survival (PFS) is currently considered the most valid
endpoint for phase 2 studies of recurrent GBM.9 If
the presently reported patients with immediate disease progression would all have been entered in a
phase 2 trial of recurrent GBM, this would have lead
to a false-positive study result with a 6-month PFS
rate of 50%.
From the clinical perspective, an important
question is how to differentiate between pseudo–
early progression and real early progression immediately after RT. Because of the inherent risks and invasiveness of a stereotactic biopsy, it is not very
attractive to obtain histologic proof of these lesions.
Moreover, it is not clear whether all cases with
pseudo-early progression will show only necrosis at
biopsy because tumor cells may still be present. Clinical deterioration during or within the 4 weeks after
RT/concomitant TMZ cannot be used to distinguish
between these entities because clinical deterioration
was also observed in the group of patients with
pseudo-early progression, although less frequently
(33% vs 67%). WHO performance score, biopsy versus surgical resection, and volume of the radiation
field also cannot be used to discriminate between
pseudo–early progression and real early progression.
The median age in the group of patients with real
early progression was found to be higher (56 years vs
46 years), which could simply reflect the higher likelihood of disease progression in elderly patients.
Again, this finding is also of no value in individual
patients. Furthermore, pseudo–early progression was
also noted in 3 of 17 patients with anaplastic glioma
(17%; 95% CI, 20.9–34.9%) versus 15 of 68 GBM
patients (22%; 95% CI, 12.2–31.9%).
To our knowledge, to date it has been unclear
whether modern imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, or diffusion-weighted and perfusion
imaging can be used to make a distinction, although
some data appear to be promising.10 Patients with
real early progression have a terrible outcome associated with continuing standard TMZ (Fig. 2); future
efforts to better identify these patients are critical so
that a potential opportunity to salvage them with an
alternative therapeutic intervention is not lost. Until

then, we advise continuing adjuvant TMZ in patients
with early disease progression and not to include
these patients in studies of malignant gliomas that
recur within 3 months after RT/TMZ. Surgery should
be considered in the case of patients who develop
early clinical signs and symptoms and a progressive
lesion. If mainly or only necrosis is found at the time
of surgery, treatment with TMZ should be continued.
