ABSTRACT
Persistent phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription
3 (STAT3) is frequently observed in tumor cells. We found that brassinin (BSN)
suppressed both constitutive and IL-6-inducible STAT3 activation in lung cancer
cells. Moreover, BSN induced PIAS-3 protein and mRNA, whereas the expression
of SOCS-3 was reduced. Knockdown of PIAS-3 by small interfering RNA prevented
inhibition of STAT3 and cytotoxicity by BSN. Overexpression of SOCS-3 in BSNtreated cells increased STAT3 phosphorylation and cell viability. BSN down-regulated
STAT3-regulated gene products, inhibited proliferation, invasion, as well as induced
apoptosis. Most importantly, when administered intraperitoneally, combination of
BSN and paclitaxel significantly decreased the tumor development in a xenograft
lung cancer mouse model associated with down-modulation of phospho-STAT3, Ki67 and CD31. We suggest that BSN inhibits STAT3 signaling through modulation of
PIAS-3 and SOCS-3, thereby attenuating tumor growth and increasing sensitivity to
paclitaxel.

INTRODUCTION

(64.6%) but in only 21 of the 56 normal tissue samples
(37.5%) and phospho-STAT3 immunoreactivity was
significantly correlated with sex (p = 0.004), smoking
history (p = 0.006), EGFR mutation status (p = 0.003),
clinical stage (p = 0.034), and lymph node metastasis (p =
0.009) [8]. Xu et al used a meta-analysis to quantitatively
assess STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 expression on the
prognosis of NSCLC and found that high STAT3 or
phospho-STAT3 expression is a strong predictor of poor
prognosis among patients with NSCLC [9]. Collectively,
these data suggest that aberrant STAT3 activation is
a strong predictor of poor prognosis in patients with
NSCLC.
There are two group of signaling proteins known
to inactivate STAT proteins, the protein inhibitors of
activated STAT (PIAS) [10] and the suppressors of
cytokine signaling (SOCS) [11-13]. Two proteins are
known to participate in the negative regulation of the
STAT signaling pathway [14]. Interestingly, PIAS-3
belongs to a multi-gene family which was first identified as

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3) belongs to the STAT family of proteins, which
is an inducible transcription factor in the cytoplasm of
most cell types. STAT3 can integrate signals from various
extracellular stimuli and kinase pathways, and it is hence
regulating many critical functions in human normal and
malignant tissues, such as differentiation, proliferation,
survival, angiogenesis, and immune system regulation
[1, 2]. Activation of STAT3 is also known to convey a
variety of survival signals by up-regulating the expression
of genes involved in cell cycle progression (Cyclin D1),
angiogenesis (VEGF, HIF-1 α), cell migration (MMP-2/9),
immune evasion (RANTES), and anti-apoptotic genes
(Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Survivin) [3-5].
Constitutive activation of STAT3 has been observed
in 22%-65% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC)
[6, 7]. Jiang et al showed that positive phospho-STAT3
expression was detected in 82 of the 127 carcinomas

a transcriptional repressor of activated STAT3 that blocks
transactivation of a STAT3-responsive reporter gene
and inhibition of the STAT3 DNA-binding activity [10].
High PIAS-3 expression has been observed in various
human cancer, such as lung, breast, and brain tumors
[15]. PIAS-3 overexpression can suppress cell growth
in human lung tumor cells [16] and is associated with
apoptosis in prostate cancer cells [17]. SOCS-3 inhibits
phosphorylation of STAT3 via binding to JAK-proximal
sites on cytokine receptors to suppress JAK activity [18].
Additionally, SOCS-3 is not only an intracellular blocker
of STAT3 but also a STAT3 transcriptional target [19].
In this study, we analyzed the potential
chemosenstizing effect(s) of brassinin (BSN), a
phytoalexin first identified as a constituent of cabbage,
that has been reported to possess chemopreventive
[20], antiproliferative [21, 22], antifungal [23], and
anticarcinogenic [24, 25] activities against human
lung carcinoma. This agent has exhibited cancer
chemopreventive activity in mouse models of mammary
and skin carcinogenesis [26], exerted remarkable antiproliferative effects on the human cervical HeLa, human
epithelial A431, and human breast MCF7 cancer cells
[27], and exerted pro-apoptotic effects against human
colorectal cancer cells [25]. Also, BSN is known to act
as a potent chemopreventive agent through the induction
of phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes [28]. More
specifically, BSN has been reported to induce G1 phase
arrest through increase of p21 and p27 by inhibition of
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway [25]
and our laboratory has demonstrated that BSN can also
suppress the constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/
S6K1 signaling cascade [29]. Although various oncogenic
targets as discussed above have been described to account
for the potent anticancer activities of BSN, our study
is the first one to explore the effects of BSN both on
STAT3 signaling pathway and on the negative regulators
of STAT3 signaling (PIAS-3 and SOCS-3) in human
lung carcinoma. We found that BSN suppressed both
constitutive and IL-6-inducible STAT3 activation; downregulated STAT3-regulated gene products; and potentiated
paclitaxel-induced apoptotic effects in NSCLC both in
vitro and in vivo.

We first investigated whether BSN can modulate
constitutive STAT3 activation in a variety of human
cancer cell lines. Because U266, DU145, A549, K562,
and SCC4 cells have been shown to express constitutive
STAT3 activation, we set out to determine whether BSN
could inhibit this activation in these cells. Interestingly we
found that it did inhibit STAT3 activation only in A549
cells, but not in U266, DU145, K562, and SCC4 cells (Fig.
1B, upper panel) and had no effect on the expression of
STAT3 proteins (Fig. 1B, lower panel), thereby indicating
that BSN-induced suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation
is cell type-specific.

BSN specifically inhibits constitutive STAT3
activation in A549 cells, but not in several human
lung cancer cell lines
We next investigated the ability of BSN can
modulate constitutive STAT3 activation in a variety
of human lung cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1C,
interestingly, A549 and H460 cells express high levels
of phospho-STAT3 protein, but PC-9 cells did not show
detectable phospho-STAT3. We also found that the
constitutive activation of STAT3 was suppressed by BSN
in A549 cells, but not in H460 cells. The data suggest
that inhibition of STAT3 activation by BSN of cell-type
specific and BSN had little effect on the expression of total
STAT3 proteins.

BSN
suppresses
constitutive
STAT3
phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent
manner
The ability of BSN to modulate constitutive STAT3
activation in A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner
was investigated. BSN suppressed the phosphorylation
of STAT3 at both (Tyr705 and Ser727 residues) in a
concentration-dependent manner in A549 cells. BSN had
no effect on the expression of STAT3 proteins (Fig. 1D).

RESULTS
The goals of this study were, first, to determine
whether BSN exerts the anti-cancer effects through the
abrogation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in NSCLC
cells; second, to analyze whether BSN can enhance
the antitumor effects of paclitaxel, chemotherapeutic
drug used extensively to treat NSCLC patients; third, to
investigate whether BSN potentiates the effects of these
targeted therapies in vivo. The chemical structure of BSN
is shown in Fig. 1A.

BSN inhibits binding of STAT3 to the DNA
Because tyrosine phosphorylation causes the
dimerization of STAT3 and their translocation to the
nucleus, where they bind to DNA and regulate gene
transcription, we determined whether BSN suppresses
the DNA binding activity of STAT3. EMSA analysis of
nuclear extracts prepared from A549 cells showed that
BSN substantially inhibited STAT3-DNA binding activity

results show that BSN can abrogate the DNA binding
ability of STAT3.

phosphorylation. H1299 cells, which lack constitutively
active STAT3 and ERK, were treated with IL-6 for
different times and then examined for phosphorylated
STAT3 and ERK. IL-6-induced phosphorylation of both
STAT3 and ERK proteins in a time-dependent manner in
H1299 cells. However, in cells pretreated with BSN for
4 h, IL-6-induced STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation was
suppressed clearly (Fig. 2C and D).

BSN reduces nuclear pool of STAT3 in NSCLC
cells
Because the active dimer of STAT3 is capable of
translocating to the nucleus and inducing transcription
of specific target genes, we analyzed whether BSN
suppresses the nuclear translocation of STAT3.
Immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1F) clearly demonstrate that
BSN blocked the translocation of STAT3 into the nucleus
in A549 cells.

BSN-induced
inhibition
phosphorylation is reversible

STAT3

We further examined whether BSN-induced
inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation is reversible. A549
cells were first treated for various intervals with BSN
and then washed twice with PBS to remove the agent.
The cells were then cultured in fresh medium for various
durations, and the level of phosphorylated STAT3 was
observed. BSN-induced the suppression of STAT3
phosphorylation (Fig. 2E, left), but after the removal of
BSN, phosphorylated STAT3 gradually increased (Fig.
2E, right). The reversal was complete by 24 h and did not
involve any changes in STAT3 protein levels (Fig. 2E,
bottom).

BSN suppresses constitutive activation of JAK1,
JAK2, and Src
STAT3 has been reported to be activated by the
soluble tyrosine kinases of the Janus family (JAK).
Because JAK1 and JAK2 were the main upstream
kinases involved, we examined the effect of BSN on
JAK1 and JAK2 activation. As shown in Fig. 2A, both
JAK1 and JAK2 were constitutively active in A549
cells and the treatment with BSN clearly suppressed this
phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner.
In addition, STAT3 is also activated by soluble tyrosine
kinases of the Src kinase families. We determined the
effect of BSN on the constitutive activation of Src kinase
in A549 cells. We found that BSN also suppressed the
constitutive phosphorylation of c-Src kinase (Fig. 2A).

BSN induces the expression of PIAS-3 and
attenuates the expression of SOCS-3 in A549 cells
The SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling)
proteins and PIAS (protein inhibitors of activated STAT)
have been suggested to function as inhibitors of cytokine
receptor signaling. We examined whether BSN can
modulate the expression of SOCS-3 and PIAS-3 in A549
cells. We found BSN led to an increased expression of
PIAS-3 and decreased expression SOCS-3 at the protein
level (Fig. 2F). Also, we found that treatment of BSN
enhanced the expression of PIAS-3 and attenuated the
expression of SOCS-3 at the mRNA level (Fig. 2G).

BSN inhibit constitutive activation of ERK and
Akt
We next investigated whether BSN affects
constitutive activation of ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) in A549
cells. We found that BSN suppressed the constitutive
phosphorylation of ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), but had
no effect on the expression of ERK proteins (Fig. 2B).
Activation of Akt has also been linked with STAT3
activation. We therefore investigated whether BSN
modulates constitutive activation of Akt (Ser473) in A549
cells. We found that BSN attenuated the constitutive
phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473). BSN had no effect on
the expression of Akt proteins (Fig. 2B).

Silencing of PIAS-3 or overexpression of SOCS-3
in BSN-treated cells reverse the effect of BSN on
activated STAT3 and cell viability
Our results demonstrate that increased expression
of PIAS-3 and decreased SOCS-3 expression following
BSN treatment is associated with reduced phosphoSTAT3 (Tyr705) expression and decreased cell viability.
To explore if silencing PIAS-3 and over-expressing
of SOCS-3 would reverse the effect of BSN on STAT3
activation, A549 cells were treated with or without BSN
(300 µM) and transfected with siRNA against PIAS-3 or
with pCMV-SOCS-3 plasmid to inhibit PIAS-3 and upregulate SOCS-3 expression, respectively. Transfection
of BSN-treated cells with siRNA of PIAS-3 abrogated

BSN also inhibits IL-6-induced STAT3 and ERK
phosphorylation
Because IL-6 is a growth factor for NSCLC cells and
induces STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation, we determined
whether BSN could inhibit IL-6-induced STAT3 and ERK

BSN-induced cell growth inhibition, whereas a significant
increase in cell viability was observed when non-treated
(NT) cells were transfected with siRNA of PIAS-3 (Fig.
3A). In A549 cells, siRNA against PIAS-3 inhibited PIAS3 expression in BSN-treated and non-treated transfected
cells compared to scrambled siRNA-transfected cells.
A marked decrease of phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) was
observed in BSN-treated cells. Interestingly, a marked
increase of phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) was seen in BSNtreated A549 cells transfected with siRNA of PIAS-3
(Fig. 3B). The Live and Dead assay (which measures
intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane
integrity) showed that BSN-treated cells transfected with
PIAS-3 siRNA showed a decrease in apoptosis from
32 to 19% (Fig. 3C). Transfection of BSN-treated cells
with pCMV-SOCS-3 plasmid abrogated BSN-induced
cell growth inhibition, whereas a significant increase in
cell viability was observed when non-treated (NT) cells
were transfected with pCMV-SOCS-3 plasmid (Fig. 3D).
Transfection of pCMV-SOCS-3 plasmid resulted in the
upregulation of SOCS-3 expression in BSN-treated and
non-treated transfected cells compared to control plasmidtransfected cells. A marked decrease of phospho-STAT3
(Tyr705) was observed in BSN-treated cells. Interestingly,
a marked increase of phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) was
seen in BSN-treated A549 cells transfected with pCMVSOCS-3 plasmid (Fig. 3E). The Live and Dead assay
showed that BSN-treated cells upon transfection with
SOCS-3 plasmid siRNA resulted in reduction of apoptosis
from 40 to 28.3% (Fig. 3F).

GmbH, Germany). As shown in Fig. 4A, BSN significantly
suppressed cell proliferation in A549 cells in a dose and
time-dependent manner.

BSN suppresses lung cancer cell invasive activity
Whether BSN can modulate A549 lung cancer cell
invasion activity was investigated. To determine this,
A549 cells were seeded to the matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ)-coated CIM-Plate
16 with or without BSN and then examined for invasion.
As shown in Fig. 4B, BSN significantly suppressed tumor
cell invasion activity in the cells.

BSN causes the increased accumulation of the
cells in the sub-G1 phase in A549 cells
We set out to determine the effect of BSN on cell
cycle phase distribution. Importantly, we also found
that the sub-G1 contents of DNA standing for apoptotic
portions were significantly increased in BSN-treated A549
cells. BSN increased the cell accumulation in the sub-G1
phase (14%) compared with the non-treated (NT) cells
(7%) (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that
BSN induced apoptotic cell death in A549 cells.

BSN promotes apoptotic cell death in A549 cells
To evaluate the potential activities of BSN to induce
apoptosis, we performed the annexin V assay. BSN
increased early apoptotic cells in A549 cells in the annexin
V assay and reached up to 17% at a concentration of 300
µM compared with the non-treated (NT) cells (3%) (Fig.
4D).

Overexpression of STAT3 attenuates BSNmediated apoptosis
We investigated whether overexpression of STAT3
by pMXs-STAT3C plasmid can prevent the effects of
BSN. The cells transfected with by pMXs-STAT3C
clearly showed overexpression of phospho-STAT3
(Tyr705) as compared with those transfected with only
control plasmid, and the overexpression of STAT3 was
clearly inhibited by BSN treatment in MEF cells (Fig.
3G). As shown in Fig. 3H, overexpression of STAT3 led
to the attenuation of BSN-mediated cleavage of PARP
as compared to the control, indicating that STAT3 is one
of the major molecular targets involved in BSN-induced
apoptosis.

BSN activates caspase-3 and causes PARP
cleavage
Whether suppression of constitutively active
STAT3 in A549 cells by BSN leads to apoptosis was
also investigated. A549 cells were treated with various
concentration of BSN and then were examined for
Caspase-3 activation by Western blotting using specific
antibody. We found a concentration-dependent activation
of caspase-3 by BSN. Activation of downstream caspase-3
led to the cleavage of a 116 kDa PARP protein into 87 kDa
fragments. These results clearly suggest that BSN induces
Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in A549 cells (Fig. 4E).

BSN suppresses cell proliferation in human lung
cancer cells
To specifically examine the anti-tumor activity
of BSN on A549 cells, the cells were treated with the
indicated concentrations of BSN, and then cell viability
was analyzed every 15 min time intervals using the

BSN down-regulates the expression of various
proteins involved in apoptosis

accordance with the experimental protocol (Fig. 6A).
The tumor diameters were measured at 5-day intervals.
Animals were killed 32 days after tumor cell injection and
25 days after the treatment start date, and the tumors were
excised and the tumor diameters were measured. We found
that BSN alone when given at 180 mg/kg very effective
inhibited the growth of the tumor when compared with
control. Paclitaxel alone was also significantly when
compared with control. The combination of the two agents
was more effective in reducing the tumor burden (Fig. 6B
and C). The tumor weight (Fig. 6D) in the combination
of BSN and paclitaxel group was significantly lower than
BSN alone group or paclitaxel alone group. Furthermore,
the BSN and paclitaxel did not affect the body weight of
mice (Fig. 6E).

STAT3 activation has been shown to regulate the
expression of various gene products involved in cell
survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. We observed that
the expression of the cell cycle regulator protein Cyclin
D1; anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, IAP1, IAP2,
and Survivin; angiogenic gene product VEGF; metastatic
gene product MMP-9; and the inﬂammatory protein COX2, all reported to be regulated by STAT3, was modulated
upon BSN treatment. BSN treatment down-regulated the
expression of these proteins in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 4F).

BSN enhances the effect of paclitaxel on induction
of apoptosis in NSCLC cells

BSN suppresses the growth of human NSCLC in
vivo and inhibits STAT3 activation from tumor
tissues

Currently, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that
is being used in cancer chemotherapy. We set out to
determine whether BSN can enhance paclitaxel-induced
cell death. First, we determined whether a combination of
BSN and paclitaxel can modulate the growth of A549 cells
exposed to various concentrations of these compounds for
24 h. As shown in Fig. 5A, the CIs indicated that certain
combinations of BSN and paclitaxel (i.e. 25 µM BSN/1
nM paclitaxel) synergistically inhibited A549 cell growth.
Next, we found that BSN or paclitaxel alone at suboptimal concentrations had little effect on levels of Bcl-xl,
Bcl-2, Cyclin D1, Survivin, and IAP1 proteins in A549
cells. However, treatment of cells with the combination
of BSN and paclitaxel resulted in a marked attenuation
in the expression levels of all of these proteins (Fig. 5B).
Also, we further examined whether BSN can potentiate
the apoptotic effect of paclitaxel in A549 cells by annexin
V assay. As shown in Fig. 5C, BSN substantially enhanced
the apoptotic effects of paclitaxel in A549 cells. In addition
Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage were further increased by
the co-treatment of BSN along with paclitaxel rather than
treatment with individual agents alone in A549 cells (Fig.
5D). Overall, these results show that combined treatment
with BSN and paclitaxel increased apoptosis in A549 cells
as compared with either drug alone.

We also tested the antitumor potential of BSN
and paclitaxel either alone or in combination in vivo via
intraperitoneal administration in a subcutaneous model of
human NSCLC using A549 cells. We evaluated the effect
of BSN and paclitaxel on constitutive phospho-STAT3
level in NSCLC tumor tissues by immunohistochemical
analysis and found that BSN and paclitaxel alone
significantly downregulated the expression of phosphoSTAT3 in tumor tissues compared with the control group,
and the combination of these two was significantly more
effective (Fig. 7A, upper panels). The Ki-67-positive
index is used as a marker for cell proliferation, and the
CD31 index is a biomarker for microvessel density.
We found that BSN and paclitaxel downregulated the
expression of these biomarkers. BSN and paclitaxel
alone significantly inhibited the expression of Ki-67 in
tumor tissues compared with the control group, and the
combination of these two was significantly more effective
(Fig. 7A, middle panels). The results also showed that
combination of BSN and paclitaxel remarkably suppressed
the expression of CD31 when compared with the control
(Fig. 7A, lower panels).

We investigated whether BSN either alone or in
combination with paclitaxel can affect STAT3 activation in

in combination with paclitaxel moderately suppressed the
activated STAT3 by inhibiting phosphorylation at Tyr705.
The results showed that treatment with combination of
BSN and paclitaxel substantially inhibited constitutive
STAT3 activation. We next examined whether BSN either
alone or in combination with paclitaxel inhibits p-JAK1,

cell implantation and was continued up to 20 days, in

p-JAK2, and p-Src in NSCLC tumor tissues. Because
p-JAK1, p-JAK2, and p-Src has also been linked with
STAT3 activation. The results showed that treatment with
combination of BSN and paclitaxel strongly inhibited
constitutive p-JAK1, p-JAK2, and p-Src in NSCLC
tumor tissues. Furthermore, combination with BSN and
paclitaxel led to an increased expression of PIAS-3 in the
tumor tissues (Fig. 7B).

phosphorylation at both Tyr705 and Ser727 in A549
cells and that these effects were cell-type specific, as
BSN had no effect on STAT3 phosphorylation in U266,
DU145, K562, and SCC4 cell lines. We also observed that
BSN inhibited nuclear translocation and DNA binding
activity of STAT3. How BSN affects STAT3 activation
was also examined in detail. The effects of BSN on
STAT3 phosphorylation correlated with the suppression
of upstream protein tyrosine kinases JAK1, JAK2, and
c-Src in A549 cells. STAT3 phosphorylation has been
closely associated with transformation and proliferation
of tumor cells [3, 30]. All Src-transformed cell lines have
persistently led to the STAT3 activation, and dominantnegative STAT3 abrogates transformation [31, 32]. Recent
reports showed constitutive STAT3 activation in lung
cancer cell lines and tissues [33-35]. Antisense STAT3
oligonucleotides have been found to induce complete loss
of STAT3 DNA-binding activity and apoptosis in A549
cells [36].
We found evidence that the BSN-induced inhibition
of STAT3 activation involves two negative regulator of
STAT3 namely PIAS-3 and SOCS-3. PIAS3 has been
known to control STAT3 transcriptional activity in lung
cancer cells through affecting its DNA transcriptional
properties and STAT3 phosphorylation [37, 38]. It has
also been reported that the overexpression of PIAS-3
inhibits STAT3 transcriptional activity and consistently
decreased proliferation of NSCLC cell lines [38].
Absence of PIAS-3 has been shown to enhance STAT3
transcriptional activity and subsequent cell proliferation
in glioblastoma multiforme tumors [39]. Loss of PIAS3 following transfection with PIAS-3 siRNA abolished
the STAT3 inhibitory effects of BSN and we further
found that deletion of PIAS-3 reversed BSN-induced cell
growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Additionally,
our results showed that the high expression of SOCS-3
was noted at the basal level in A549 cells. These results
are in agreement with results showing that the SOCS-3
expression was highly elevated in human breast cancer
[40], melanoma tissues [41], and primary lymphoma
cells [42]. The marked reduction in the expression of
SOCS-3 following BSN treatment of A549 cells resulted
in the marked suppression of STAT3 activation, and
overexpression of SOCS-3 by using SOCS-3 plasmid
abrogated BSN-mediated STAT3 inhibition, cell growth
inhibition, and induction of apoptosis.
Our previous study has demonstrated that BSN
suppressed the constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/
S6K1 pathway, which correlated with the induction of
apoptosis in PC-3 cells [29]. Here, we found that BSN
inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 at both Tyr705
and Ser727 in A549 cells. It has been known that STAT3
phosphorylation at serine residue is mediated by the
rapamycin target mTOR in ciliary neurotrophic factor
signaling [43]. JAK/STAT pathway is one of the important
downstream routes for epidermal growth factor receptor

BSN inhibited the STAT3-regulated gene products
in NSCLC tumor tissues
STAT3 activation has been shown to regulate
the expression of various gene products involved in
cell cycle regulator protein (Cyclin D1), anti-apoptotic
proteins (Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, IAP1, and Survivin). Whether
BSN and paclitaxel can modulate the expression of
these STAT3-regulated gene products in tumor tissues
was also examined by Western blot analysis. We found
that treatment with combination of BSN and paclitaxel
was effective in down-regulating the overexpression of
various gene products regulated by STAT3 (Fig. 7C). In
addition, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage were
further increased by co-treatment of BSN and paclitaxel
in NSCLC tumor tissues (Fig. 7D).

DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to determine whether BSN
exerts its anti-cancer effects through modulation of the
negative regulators of STAT3 signaling pathway in human
lung carcinoma cells. We found that this agent suppressed
both constitutive and IL-6-inducible STAT3 activation in
the cells in parallel with the inhibition of JAK1, JAK2,
and c-Src activation. Surprisingly, BSN triggered the
expression of PIAS-3 protein, whereas expression of
SOCS-3 was suppressed. Moreover, the knockdown of
PIAS-3 using siRNA suppressed the induction of PIAS3 and reversed the inhibition of STAT3 activation, and
resulted in increased cell viability and decreased apoptotic
effect. Overexpression of SOCS-3 in BSN-treated cells
increased expression of STAT3 phosphorylation, cell
viability, and anti-apoptotic effect. BSN down-regulated
the expression of various STAT3-regulated gene products,
including Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, Survivin, Cyclin D1, IAP1/2,
VEGF, MMP-9, and COX-2. It also caused the inhibition
of proliferation, increased accumulation of cells in sub-G1
phase, and significantly enhanced the apoptotic effects of
paclitaxel in A549 cells. Intraperitoneal injection of BSN
and paclitaxel into athymic nu/nu female mice bearing
subcutaneous A549 xenografts resulted in significant
suppression of tumor progression and inhibition of STAT3
activation in tumor tissues.
We found for the first time that BSN could
suppress both constitutive and IL-6-induced STAT3

(EGFR) signaling [44], whereas PI3K is one of the
downstream signaling molecules of the EGFR and plays a
role in the proliferation or invasion of tumor cells [45, 46],
thereby further implicating important correlation between
STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. Moreover,
BSN also suppressed the constitutive ERK activation that
is known to be required for STAT3 phosphorylation on
serine 727 [47].
We also demonstrate that BSN inhibited the
expression of various STAT3-regulated gene products,
such as anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, Survivin, and
IAP1/2), proliferative (Cyclin D1), metastatic (MMP9 and COX-2), and angiogenetic (VEGF). Constitutive
STAT3 activation has been known to induce resistance to
apoptosis [48], possibly through up-regulation of Bcl-2,
Bcl-xl, IAP1/2, and Survivin expression [49]. The downregulation of Cyclin D1 expression by BSN associated
with the suppression in proliferation and accumulation
of cells in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle, suggesting
that Cyclin D1 plays an important role in the observed
anti-proliferative effect of BSN. We also found that BSN
significantly inhibited tumor cell invasion activity in A549
cells, which may be explained by its ability to negatively
regulate the expression of MMP-9 and COX-2 proteins.
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl expression are mainly regulated by
STAT3 pathway, and these proteins are overexpressed in
lung cancer cells [50, 51]. The downregulation of Bcl2, Bcl-xl and survivin proteins could account for BSN’s
ability to induce substantial apoptosis in A549 cells.
Although paclitaxel is widely used for the treatment
of NSCLC, this drug has severe side effects and patients
frequently develop chemoresistance [52, 53]. Besides,
paclitaxel has shown synergistic interaction with various
classes of targeted therapeutic agents and is at present
being evaluated in the neo-adjuvant and adjuvant
treatment settings for early stage NSCLC [53]. We also
noted that BSN can synergistically improve paclitaxel
sensitivity in A549 cells. Interestingly, BSN was found to
exert synergistic cytotoxic effect at a low concentration
of 25 µM and higher concentrations like 50 or 75 μM
did not significantly affect the paclitaxel sensitivity. The
combinational treatment potentiated paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis through the downregulation of various STAT3regulated gene products. We further observed that BSN
and paclitaxel co-treatment significantly suppressed
tumor growth in a xenograft lung cancer model and also
substantially downregulated the expression of various
STAT3 regulated genes in mice tissues. In addition, our
preclinical studies imply that the potential of combining
BSN with paclitaxel to reduce the harmful side effect of
chemotherapy during the treatment of lung cancer.
Overall, our results indicate for the first time that
BSN can inhibit constitutive and inducible STAT3
signaling pathway through modulation of PIAS-3 and
SOCS-3 proteins, as well as can enhance the effects of
paclitaxel through the downregulation of gene products

37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. At ~70–90% confluence,
the cells were subcultured using 0.05% trypsin/EDTA
(Gibco-BRL).

A549 cells were with BSN for 4 h, the cells were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at room
temperature and then washed three times in PBS. The cells
were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20
min, washed three times in PBS, and then blocked with 5%
BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were
then incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-STAT3 (1:100;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), washed
three times, and incubated with Alexa 488-labeled goat
anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)
for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the cells were stained
with a 1 µg/ml DAPI solution and mounted on glass slides
using Fluorescent Mounting Medium (GBI Laboratories,
Manchester, UK). Using an Olympus FluoViewFV1000
confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), DAPI and
FITC fluorescence were excited (Ex: 405 nm and 488 nm)
and detected (Em: 461 nm and 519 nm) with 2.1% laser
transmissivity and 5.0% laser transmissivity, respectively.

Western blot analysis
For detection of STAT proteins, BSN-treated wholecell extracts were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH
7.4), 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton
X-100, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.005 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.4
mM phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 4 mM
NaVO4). The lysates were then spun at 14,000 rpm for
10 min to remove insoluble material and resolved on a
8% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were
electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membranes (Pall
Corporation, MI, USA), blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and
probed with anti-STAT antibodies (1:1000) overnight at
4°C. The blots were washed, exposed to HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 2 h, and finally examined by
chemiluminescent substrate (GE Healthcare, Waukesha,
USA). For the apoptotic study, the appropriate amounts
of cell lysates (20 µg) were separated at 8 to 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electro-transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were
blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (Tris-buffered
saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h, washed and then
incubated with the following primary antibodies: antiPARP, anti-Caspase-3, anti-Cyclin D1, anti-Survivin,
anti-IAP1/2, anti-VEGF, anti-MMP-9, anti-COX-2, antiBcl-2, and anti-Bcl-xl (diluted 1:1000 in 5% skim milk in
TBST; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The
equal loading of samples were controlled using β-actin.
Antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C on a rocking
platform. The membranes were then incubated for 2 h with
HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG Abs
(diluted 1/5000 in TBST) and the immunoreactive bands
were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Cells were washed and suspended in Trizol reagent.
Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). One
microgram of total RNA was converted to cDNA by
superscript reverse transcriptase and then amplified by
Platinum Taq polymerase using superscript one step
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). The relative expressions of PIAS-3 and
SOCS-3 were analyzed using MyGeneTM Series Peltier
Thermal Cycler (Model MG96G, LongGene, Hangzhou,
PRC) with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) as an internal control. The reaction was
performed at 50°C for 30 min, 94°C for 2 min, and 30
cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1
min, with extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products
were run on 1% agarose gel and then stained with loading
star (Dynebio, Gyeonggi, Korea). Stained bands were
visualized under UV light and photographed.

EMSA for STAT3-DNA binding
STAT3-DNA binding was analyzed by
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a

P-labeled high-affinity sis-inducible element (hSIE)
probe (5’-CTTCATTTCCCGTAAATCCCTAAAGCT-3’
and 5’-AGCTTTAGGGATTTACGGGAAATGA-3’) as
previously described [54]. Briefly, nuclear extracts were
prepared from BSN-treated cells and incubated with the
labeled hSIE probe. The DNA–protein complex formed
was separated from free oligonucleotide on 5% native
polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were visualized with
a Universial hood II (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA).

Transfection of plasmids
We investigated the ability of commercially available
electroporation systems, the Neon™ Transfection System
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfection efficiency was
measured by Western blot analysis. A549 and MEF cells
were prepared for transfection after cells were resuspended
with 120 µl of Neon Resuspension Buffer R for every one
million cells. For each electroporation, A549 cells with 50
nM of PIAS-3 siRNA, scrambled siRNA, 1 µg of pCMVSOCS-3 or pCMV plasmids, MEF cells with 1 µg of

pMXs-STAT3C or pMXs-gw plasmids were aliquoted into
a sterile microcentrifuge tube. A Neon Tip was inserted
into the Neon Pipette and the mixture was aspirated into
the tip avoiding air bubbles. The Neon Pipette was then
inserted into the Neon Tube containing 3 ml of Neon
Electrolytic Buffer E in the Neon Pipette Station. A549
cells were pulsed twice with a voltage of 1,200 and a
width of 30. MEF cells were pulsed once with a voltage of
1,350 and a width of 30. After 48 h of transfection, A549
and MEF cells were treated with 300 µM of BSN for 4 h
or 24 h. Then whole-cell extracts were prepared for PIAS3, SOCS-3, phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), STAT3, PARP, and
β-actin analysis by Western blotting.

plating, impedance was recorded in 15 min intervals. All
experiments were performed in triplicates. Cell Index (CI)
values were normalized to the time point of 100 and 300
µM of BSN administration (referred to as normalized CI).

Invasion assay
We employed the Roche xCELLigence Real-Time
Cell Analyzer (RTCA) DP instrument (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Germany) to measure cellular invasion. The RTCA
DP instrument uses the CIM (cellular invasion/migration)Plate 16, which features microelectronic sensors integrated
onto the underside of the microporous polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) membrane of a Boyden-like chamber.
For invasion experiments, the top chamber of the CIMPlate 16 was coated with matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) before addition
of the medium to the bottom chamber. The CIM-Plate
16 was assembled by placing the top chamber onto the
bottom chamber and snapping the two together. Serumfree medium was placed in the top chamber to hydrate and
pre-incubate the membrane for 1 h in the CO2 incubator at
37°C before obtaining a background measurement. Cells
were lightly trypsinized, pelleted and resuspended at the
indicated cell densities in serum-free medium. Once the
CIM-Plate 16 has been equilibrated, it was placed in the
RTCA DP station and the background cell index values
were measured. The CIM-Plate 16 was then removed from
the RTCA DP station and the cells are added to the top
chamber at the desired density.

MTT assay
A549 cells were seeded at a density of 1×104 cells/
well in 96-well plates. The cells were incubated with
300 µM of BSN. After 24 h incubation, 20 µl of MTT
(2 mg/ml) was added to each well. After incubation
at 37°C for 2 h, extraction buffer (20% SDS and 50%
dimethylformamide) was added to the cells. The cells
were incubated overnight at 37°C, and the absorbance was
then measured at 570 nm by a microplate reader (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA).

Live and dead assay
To measure apoptosis, we used the Live and Dead
assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which determines
intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane
integrity. This assay employs calcein, a polyanionic dye,
which is retained within the live cells and provides green
fluorescence. It also employs the ethidium monomer dye
(red fluorescence), which can enter the cells only through
damaged membranes and bind to nucleic acids but is
excluded by the intact plasma membrane of live cells.
Briefly, A549 cells were seeded at a density of 3×104 cells/
well in 8-well slide chamber. The cells were incubated
with 300 µM of BSN for 24 h. Cells are stained with the
Live and Dead reagent (5 µM ethidium homodimer, 5
µM calcein-AM) and then incubated at 37°C for 30 min.
Cells were analyzed under an Olympus FluoViewFV1000
confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Cell cycle analysis
To determine apoptosis, cell cycle analysis was
performed using propidium iodide. A549 cells were
seeded onto 6-wellplates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well
and incubated for one day. After treatment with 300 µM of
BSN for 24 h, the cells were collected and washed with 1×
PBS. Cell pellets were ﬁxed in 70% cold ethanol overnight
at -20°C. The ﬁxed cells were resuspended in 1× PBS
containing 1 mg/ml RNase A, incubated for 1 h at 37°C
incubation. Cells were then washed, resuspended, and
stained in PBS containing 25 µg/ml of propidium iodide
for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The DNA
contents of the stained cells were analyzed using Cell
Quest Software with a FACScan Calibur flowcytometry
(BD Biosciences, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Monitoring of cell growth with the RTCA MP
Instrument

Annexin V assay

Cell growth behavior was continuously monitored
for 72 h using the xCELLigence RTCA MP Instrument
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). Background
impedance was measured in 100 µl cell culture medium
per well. The final volume was adjusted to 200 µl cell
culture medium, including 5 × 103 cells/well. After

of membrane asymmetry can be detected using the binding
properties of annexin V. A549 cells were plated at a
density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plate. The cells were
treated with 300 µM of BSN for 24 h. After treatment, the
cells were collected and washed with cold PBS. Treated
sample were assayed for phosphatidylserine exposure by
using an annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Stained samples were analyzed by a flow
cytometer (FACScanCalibur, BD Biosciences, BectonDickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Acquisition and analysis
of the data were performed using Cell Quest 3.0f software.

the mice were randomized into the following treatment
groups (n = 8/group) based on the tumor volume. Group
I (control) was treated with corn oil (100 µl; i.p.;3 times/
week), group II was treated with BSN alone (180 mg/kg;
i.p.; 3 times/week), group III was treated with paclitaxel
alone (3 mg/kg; i.p.; once a week), and group IV with a
combination of BSN (180 mg/kg; i.p.; 3 times/week) and
paclitaxel (3 mg/kg; i.p.; once a week) (n = 8). Treatment
was continued for up to 20 days from the date of
randomization (Day 0). The tumor volume was measured
at 5-day intervals. The mice were killed 25 days after
randomization. The tumors were carefully excised and
measured to calculate tumor volume. The tumor volume
was derived using the formula V = 4/3 πr3, where r is the
mean of the 3 dimensions (length, width, and depth). Half
of the tumor tissue was fixed in formalin and embedded
in paraffin for immunohistochemistry and routine
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The other half was
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.

Combination therapy studies
A549 cells were seeded and cotreated with BSN (0,
25, 50, or 75 µM) and paclitaxel (0, 1, 2.5, or 5 nM) for an
additional 24 h. After treatment, cells were collected and
washed with chilled PBS, and the treated samples were
examined using a MTT assay and Western blotting.

Western blot analysis for tumor tissues

Animal study

NSCLC tumor tissues (75–100 mg) from control
and experimental mice were minced and incubated on
ice for 30 minutes in 0.5 ml of T-PER Tissue Protein
Extraction Reagent. The minced tissue was centrifuged
at 16,000 × g at 4°C for 20 minutes. The proteins were
then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody,
and detected by enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (GE
Healthcare, Waukesha, USA).

All procedures involving animals were reviewed
and approved by Kyung Hee University Institutional
Animal Care and Use committee [KHUASP(SE)-13-044].
Six-week-old athymic nu/nu female mice were purchased
from Orientbio Inc. (Sungnam, Korea). The animals were
housed (8 mice/cage) in the standard mice plexiglass
cages in a room maintained at constant temperature and
humidity under 12 h light and dark cycle and fed with
regular autoclaved mouse chow with water ad libitum.
None of the mice exhibited any lesions and all were
tested pathogen-free. Before initiating the experiment, we
acclimatized all mice to a pulverized diet for 3 days.

Immunohistochemical analysis of NSCLC tumor
samples
Solid tumors from control and various treatment
groups were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin
(BBC Biochemical, USA), processed and embedded
in paraffin. Sections were cut and deparaffinized in
xylene, and dehydrated in graded alcohol and finally
hydrated in water. Antigen retrieval was performed by
boiling the slide in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for
30 minutes. Immunohistochemistry was performed
following manufacturer instructions (Vector Laboratories
ImmPRESSTM REAGENT KIT). Briefly, endogenous
peroxidases were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide.
Non-specific binding was blocked by incubation in the
blocking reagent in the ImmPRESSTM REAGENT
KIT (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were
incubated overnight with primary antibody: phosphoSTAT3, anti-Ki-67 and CD31 (at 1:100 dilutions).
Slides were subsequently washed several times in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were incubated with
ImmPRESSTM reagent according to the manufacturer’s

Subcutaneous implantation of A549 cells
A549 cells were injected subcutaneously into the
mice as described previously [55]. In brief, A549 cells
were harvested from subconfluent cultures, washed
once in serum-free medium, and resuspended in PBS.
Only suspensions consisting of single cells, with >
90% viability, were used for the injections. A549 cells
[1 × 107 cells/100 µl PBS:Matrigel (1:1)] were injected
subcutaneously into the right flank. To prevent leakage, a
cotton swab was held cautiously for 1 minute over the site
of injection.

Experimental protocol
After 1 week of implantation, tumor diameters were
measured using Digimatic caliper (Mitutoyo Company,
Japan). When tumors have reached 0.25 cm in diameter,

using 3, 3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)
as a substrate. Sections were counterstained with Gill’s
hematoxylin and mounted under glass cover slips.
Images were taken using an Olympus BX51 microscope
(magnification, 40×). Positive cells (brown) were
quantitated using the Image-Pro plus 6.0 software package

Statistical analysis
The results were expressed as means ± SD, and an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni’s test was
used for the statistical analysis of multiple comparisons of
data. P-value of 0.05 or less was considered as significant.
To obtain the evidence of a synergistic effect between
BSN and Paclitaxel, the combination index (CI) was
determined by the Chou–Talalay method and calcusyn
software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO).
