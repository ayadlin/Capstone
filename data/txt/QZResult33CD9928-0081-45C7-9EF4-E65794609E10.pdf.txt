BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate 3 different doses of (7a)-21-(4-[(diethylamino)methyl]-2
methoxyphenoxy)-7 methyl-19 norpregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate (TAS-108) in
patients with recurrent, hormone-responsive breast cancer. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter
study, TAS-108 was administered daily at a dose of 40 mg, 80 mg, or 120 mg to postmenopausal patients with locally
advanced, or inoperable, or metastatic hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. The primary efficacy outcome was
clinical benefit (CB), defined as the total number of patients who achieved a complete response, a partial response,
or stable disease for 24 weeks. The study was a 2-stage design in which 19 patients per dose group were planned in
the first stage. If at least 3 patients in any dose group achieved a CB, then that dose group was to be allowed to continue enrolling for the second stage, and the group could include up to a total of 60 patients. RESULTS: The 40-mg
and 80-mg groups met the criterion and enrolled patients into the second stage. In the 40-mg group, there were 13
CB events in 60 patients (21.7%); and, in the 80-mg group, there were 12 CB events in 60 patients (20%). The 120-mg
daily dose was stopped early, because it failed to achieve the criterion. For the 40-mg and 80-mg groups, the median
time to progression was 15.0 weeks and 15.9 weeks, respectively. Only 1 drug-related serious adverse event (grade 3

INTRODUCTION
TAS-108
([7a]-21-[4-([diethylamino]methyl)-2
methoxyphenoxy]-7 methyl-19 norpregna-1,3,5[10]trien-3-ol 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate) is a
novel steroidal compound that possesses both estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) antagonist activity and partial ERb
agonist activity,1 potentially providing TAS-108 with
bone-protective effects. TAS-108 is not expected to have
some of the complications associated with selective ER
modulators, such as tamoxifen (which has an increased
risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic disease),
or aromatase inhibitors (arthralgia, cardiovascular disease,
and an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures).2-9 It has reported that TAS-108 may be effective
against estrogen-dependent, tamoxifen-resistant tumors
in vitro10; it may have a beneficial effect on bone-mineral
density11; and it may have less of an agonist effect on the
endometrium compared with tamoxifen in animal
studies.1
Phase 1 clinical studies have demonstrated that
TAS-108 is well tolerated at doses up to 160 mg daily.
Toxicities generally were mild to moderate and included
arthralgia, hot flashes, headache, nausea, and vomiting.
There were no significant changes reported in endometrial
thickness or markers of bone metabolism. In 2 phase 1
studies in postmenopausal women with locally advanced,
or inoperable, or metastatic hormone receptor-positive
breast cancer, stable disease (SD) was reported in 8 of 16
patients,12 9 of 15 patients had 2 partial responses (PRs),
and the overall clinical benefit (CB) rate (complete
responses [CRs] plus PRs plus SD for 24 weeks) was
33.3%.13 In the current study, we evaluated 3 doses of
TAS-108 in postmenopausal patients who had recurrent,
hormone-responsive breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted at 42 centers in the United
States, 9 centers in Russia, 4 centers in Chile, and 3 centers in Mexico. An institutional review board at each center approved the study protocol, and each patient signed
an informed consent form before enrollment. This study
was conducted in compliance with International ConferCancer

ence on Harmonization guidelines and all applicable regulatory requirements.
Study Design
In this phase 2, randomized, double-blinded study of
TAS-108 administered orally at a dose of 40 mg, 80 mg,
or 120 mg once daily (28-day cycles), we independently
explored the safety and efficacy profiles of these 3 doses;
therefore, sample size was based on a single-arm study
design. The study used a Simon optimal 2-stage design
with adaptation from Panageas,14,15 thus avoiding premature termination of the trial and also avoiding the treatment of too many patients with ineffective study therapy.
Each dose was to be evaluated independently after specifying some clinically uninteresting rates (PCRþPR  8%
plus PSD  8% for second-line patients and PCRþPR 
5% plus PSD  5% for third-line patients) and some relevant target rates (PCRþPR  15% or PSD  15% for second-line patients and PCRþPR  10% or PSD  10% for
third-line patients). The null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1) were stated as follows: H0,
PCRþPR  6.2% and PSD  6.2%; H1, PCRþPR  12% or
PSD  12%.
When error rates were controlled by using a ¼ .1
and b ¼ .2, the first-stage sample size equaled 19 patients
for each dose group, and the upper limit for first-stage
rejection of the drug was 2 patients. Thus, if at least 3
patients had any combination of a CR, a PR, and SD for
24 weeks, then the study would continue to the second
stage for that dose group. The total sample size for the 2
stages combined equaled 60 patients for each dose group,
and the upper limit for second-stage rejection of the drug
was 10 patients. Thus, for this study to be positive with
respect to tumor response or CB, a minimum of 11
patients within a dose group had to have any combination
of a CR, a PR, and SD for 24 weeks. Patients continued
treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
death, or discontinuation from the study for any other
reason.
Eligibility Criteria
Eligibility requirements included age >18 years; postmenopausal women; histologically or cytologically

confirmed cancer of the breast that was locally advanced,
locally recurrent and inoperable, or metastatic with documented disease progression; positive ER and/or progesterone receptor status (as determined in the primary tumor
by the study site); responded to standard first-line or second-line hormone antitumor therapy (stable on hormone
after 6 months qualified as response; oophorectomy qualified as hormone therapy); disease progression after 1 or 2
previous systemic hormone antitumor therapies, excluding adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy; 1 regimen of previous single-agent or combination chemotherapy for
advanced metastatic disease was allowed if given before
the last hormone therapy; a Zubrod performance status
2; a predicted life expectancy 12 weeks; measurable
disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors; and adequate hematopoietic, renal, and liver
function.
Patients were ineligible if they had untreated or
symptomatic brain metastasis, extensive liver involvement, or lymphangitic lung metastasis; inflammatory
breast cancer; received supplemental estrogen or progesterone within 3 weeks of study start; received more than 2
previous hormone antitumor therapies or more than 1
previous chemotherapy (adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not count); other serious illness or medical
condition(s); or known hypersensitivity to any of the constituents of the study drug. If the patient’s last therapy was
chemotherapy, then the patient was ineligible.
Assessments of Efficacy and Safety
Efficacy evaluation was according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0. The primary efficacy variables were CR and PR, and CB (CR, PR, or SD for 24
weeks). Endpoint adjudication was performed by an independent Clinical Endpoint Committee, which reviewed
those patients who were assessed by the investigator as
having a CR, PR, or SD at 24 weeks. Safety data included
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0), toxicity assessments, and laboratory data.
Statistical Analysis
Efficacy population

All patients who received at least 1 dose of study
drug and had tumor measurement and response data
available, with the exception of patients who withdrew
within the first 8 weeks of treatment for reasons other
than disease progression or study drug-related toxicity,

3246

were grouped into an efficacy population. This population was limited to the chronological enrollment of
patients in each dose group who comprised the first 19
patients (for stage 1 enrollment) or the first 60 patients
(for stage 1 and 2 enrollment).
Safety population

All patients who received at least 1 dose of study
drug were grouped into a safety population, and this population was used in all safety analyses. The primary efficacy analysis was CB (ie, a CR, PR, or SD for 24
weeks). For CR or PR, the response had to be confirmed
between 4 weeks and 8 weeks from the first date a
response was recorded. SD was confirmed as a CB only
after a period of 24 weeks.
Secondary efficacy analyses included the time to disease progression, progression-free survival, response duration (CR, PR, or SD), and time to CB. The time to
disease progression was defined as the number of weeks
between the date of randomization and the date of first
disease progression. Progression-free survival was defined
as the number of weeks between the date of randomization and the date of first disease progression or death from
any cause, whichever came first. The time to CB was
defined as the number of weeks between the date of randomization and the date of the first CB. Patients who
never achieved a CB were excluded. The duration of CR,
PR, or SD was defined as the number of weeks between
the date of first objective status assessment and the date of
disease progression or death from any cause, whichever
came first. For patients who never achieved a CR, PR, or
SD 24 weeks, the duration of CR, PR, or SD was
recorded as missing and was excluded from the analysis.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between October 15, 2003 and November 30, 2006, 61
patients in this study were randomized into the 40-mg
group, 66 patients were randomized into the 80-mg
group, and 19 patients were randomized into the 120-mg
group. The efficacy population consisted of 60 patients in
the 40-mg group, 60 patients in the 80-mg group, and 19
patients in the 120-mg group. Disease characteristics and
previous treatments are provided in Table 1.
Seven patients were excluded to form the efficacy
population (all patients who received at least 1 dose of
study drug with the exception of patients who withdrew
within the first 8 weeks of treatment for reasons other

other 3 patients were ‘‘extra’’ patients (ie, 60 evaluable
patients already had completed the study) and were not
included in the efficacy analysis. Thus, the efficacy population consisted of 60 patients (98.4%) in the 40-mg
group, 60 patients (90.9%) in the 80-mg group, and 19
patients (100%) in the 120-mg group.
Efficacy
Clinical benefit

Both the 40-mg group and the 80-mg group
achieved the threshold 3 CB events within the first 19
patients evaluated and, thus, enrolled patients into the second stage. The 120-mg group did not meet this criterion
(1 CB event) and, thus, only 19 patients were enrolled in
the group (Table 2).
For the 40-mg group (Table 2), CB was reported in
21.7% of patients, including 8.3% who had a CR or a PR
and 13.3% who had SD for 24 weeks. The median duration of CB, CR or PR, and SD 24 weeks was 32.1,
57.3, and 32.1 weeks, respectively (Table 3).
For the 80-mg group (Table 2), CB was reported in
20% of patients, including 5% who had a CR or a PR and

3248

15% of patients who had SD for 24 weeks. The median
duration of CB, CR or PR, and SD for 24 weeks was
64.3 weeks, 108.1 weeks, and 52.1 weeks, respectively
(Table 3).
Time to disease progression

In the 40-mg, 80-mg, and 120-mg groups, 76.7%,
80%, and 78.9%, respectively, experienced disease progression; and the median time to disease progression was
15.0 weeks, 11.1 weeks, and 15.9 weeks, respectively (Table 3). The survival curves across the 3 dose groups were
similar (Fig. 1).
Extent of exposure

The median number of days on study drug was 71.5
days (range, 36-722 days) in the 40-mg group, 112 days
(range, 14-812 days) for the 80-mg group, and 85 days
(range, 14-812 days) for the 120-mg group.
Safety
In total, 1165 TEAEs were reported by 124 patients.
Thus, 83.3% of patients in the 40-mg group, 83.3% of
patients in the 80-mg group, and 100% of patients in the

3.9% of TEAEs that were grade 3 in severity were considered related. Only 1.1% of TEAEs resulted in interruption of study drug, and 0.8% resulted in discontinuation.
Only 1 serious TEAE (an episode of grade 3 hyperglycemia in the 40-mg group) was considered related to
study drug (possibly related because of a temporal association with the onset of study drug administration). The

most commonly reported TEAEs (Table 4) were gastrointestinal disorders (primarily nausea and diarrhea), general
disorders (fatigue), musculoskeletal disorders (arthralgia
and back pain), and nervous system disorders (headache).
In patients who received 12 courses of therapy (1
course ¼ 28 days), the median changes from baseline in
bone mineral density (n ¼ 20) and T-scores (n ¼ 19)
were 0.0115 g/cm2 (0.608 g/cm2 to 0.403 g/cm2) and
0.900 mm (3.92 mm to 0.10 mm), respectively.
The median changes in bone mineral density and T-scores
by dose group were 0.0015 mg/cm2 and 0.700 mm,
respectively, in the 40-mg group (n ¼ 10 of 10 patients);
0.0110 mg/cm2 and 0.950 mm, respectively, in the 80mg group (n ¼ 9 of 8 patients); and 0.2730 mg/cm2 and
1.400 mm, respectively, in the 120-mg group (n ¼ 1 of
1 patient).

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we assessed the efficacy of 3 doses of
TAS-108. The 40-mg daily and 80-mg daily doses of
TAS-108 achieved the predefined criterion for desired

3250

antitumor activity. The finding that the 120-mg group
did not reach the threshold for success is not entirely surprising, because steroidal hormone and target interaction
is complex and exhibits nonmonotonic dose-response
relations. Hormone agents do not always display a linear
dose response and commonly display a plateau effect. It is
possible the 120-mg dose was beyond the plateau phase of
the dose-response curve, thus resulting in a potential
‘‘threshold-like’’ phenomenon and/or a ‘‘reverse doseresponse’’ effect.
The objective response rates of 8.5% for the 40-mg
group and 5% for the 80-mg group compare well with a
6.6% objective response rate reported in patients who
received exemestane (steroidal aromatase inhibitor) as second-line or later therapy16 and objective response rates of
7.4% with fulvestrant (an ER antagonist) and 6.7% with
exemestane reported in the Exemestane Clinical Trial
(EFECT) in patients who experienced a relapse after nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy.17 There are very
limited data regarding the efficacy of tamoxifen after aromatase inhibitor therapy. One retrospective study of 98

TEAEs were defined as any AE reported with an onset date on or after the first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug (including death, if it occurred within 30 days from the last
dose of study drug). Adverse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (version 6.0; MedDRA, Maintenance and Support Services Organization, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Geneva, Switzerland), and adverse event severity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0; National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md).

previously treated with anastrozole reported an 11.2%
objective response rate.18
The CB duration in our study was particularly
encouraging. The median response durations of 57.3
weeks in the 40-mg group and 108.1 weeks the 80-mg
group were comparable to the reported median response
durations of 58.4 weeks with exemestane and 13.5
months (57.9 weeks) and 9.8 months (42 weeks) for fulvestrant and exemestane, respectively, in the EFECT trial.
The median CB durations of 32.1 weeks and 64.3 weeks
in the 40-mg and 80-mg groups, respectively, also compare favorably to the median CB durations of 37 weeks
with exemestane and 9.3 months (39.8 weeks) and 8.3
months (35.6 weeks) with fulvestrant and exemestane,
respectively, in the EFECT trial. Likewise, the median
times to progression of 15.0 weeks and 15.9 weeks in the
40-mg and 80-mg groups, respectively, compare very
favorably with the median times to progression of 14.7
weeks in the exemestane study and 3.7 months (15.8
weeks) for both fulvestrant and exemestane in the EFECT
trial.
TAS-108 was well tolerated. Nine patients (6.2%)
withdrew from the study because of a TEAE, and 2
patients (1.4%) had a study drug-related TEAE. One
study drug-related, serious TEAE was reported, and there
were no study drug-related deaths. There were no thromboembolic events, and TAS-108 had a minor effect on,
but did not worsen, bone mineral density.
The 40-mg group had the fewest TEAEs per patient.
The highest frequency of grade 3 study drug-related
TEAEs was in the 80-mg group. The highest dose level of
120 mg appeared to be associated with the most side
effects.
On the basis of the acceptable CB in the current
study with no clear dose effect between the tested doses of
40 mg daily and 120 mg daily, the safety profile demonstrating a possible increase in TEAEs with increasing dose,
and the TAS-108 pharmacokinetic profile,19,20 the 40mg dose of TAS-108 is an appropriate dose for further
testing. Further phase 2 and phase 3 trials are warranted in
patients with metastatic breast disease to compare the
safety and efficacy of TAS-108 with those of currently
available endocrine agents. A role for TAS-108 in premenopausal patients will need to be evaluated.
