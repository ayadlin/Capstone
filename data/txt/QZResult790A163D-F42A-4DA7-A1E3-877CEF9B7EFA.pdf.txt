ABSTRACT
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported
to increase cognitive performance in some clinical studies of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). However, there is a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of
SSRIs as cognition enhancers in AD, and the role of SSRIs as a treatment for
AD remains largely unclear. Here, we characterized the impact of fluoxetine
(FLX), a well-known SSRI, on neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) and in
CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus of middle-aged (16 to 17 months old)
APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model mice. We found that
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of FLX (10 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks effectively
alleviated the impairment of spatial learning ability in middle-aged APP/
PS1 mice as evaluated using the Morris water maze. More importantly, the
number of neurons in the hippocampal DG was significantly increased by
FLX. Additionally, FLX reduced the deposition of beta amyloid, inhibited GSK3β activity and increased the level of β-catenin in middle-aged APP/PS1
mice. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that FLX delayed the
progression of neuronal loss in the hippocampal DG in middle-aged AD mice,
and this effect may underlie the FLX-induced improvement in learning ability.
FLX may therefore serve as a promising therapeutic drug for AD.

INTRODUCTION

Moreover, hippocampal neuron loss has been reported to
exceed the amyloid deposits and the neurofibrillary tangles
in the transgenic mouse model of AD or in patients with
AD [5, 6]. Additionally, it has been reported that the
decline in cognitive abilities during the late stage of AD
appears to more correlate with significant neuron loss
than with the amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles
in the hippocampus [1, 7, 8]. In fact, many reports have
demonstrated that cognitive impairments can be improved
by some drugs through the attenuation of neuronal cell
death or the rescue of neurogenesis in the hippocampus
of AD animal models [9-12]. Still, no effective treatment

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has emerged as the most
common cause of dementia in the elderly, characterized
by progressive learning dysfunction and memory loss.
Some researchers have termed AD as “hippocampal
dementia” [1] because the hippocampus is one of the first
and most profoundly damaged structures in AD. Amyloid
deposits and neurofibrillary tangles, two main pathological
hallmarks of AD in the hippocampus, have been found to
result in significant hippocampal neuronal dysfunction
and death in the clinically detectable stage of AD [2-4].

for AD is currently available. Although several drugs
have been approved for the clinical treatment of AD [13],
these drugs activate cholinergic or suppress glutamatergic
neurotransmission and therefore improve only the
symptoms of AD. Their neuroprotective activities remain
a topic of debate [14-16].
Fluoxetine (FLX) is a selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor (SSRI) that was approved by the US FDA in
1987 for treating depression. Recently, studies of some
clinical types of AD accompanied by depression have
demonstrated that FLX enhances cognitive performance
in AD patients [17, 18]. However, it is difficult to discern
whether the effect of FLX on cognitive improvement
in AD patients is due to a direct effect on cognition or
is an outcome of mood stabilization. Recently, it has
been shown that FLX ameliorates cognitive defects in
transgenic AD mice in the early stage of AD [19, 20].
Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether FLX enhances
cognitive abilities in transgenic AD mice in the late stage
of AD. Moreover, the reason for the protective effect
of FLX in AD mice is not completely understood. It is
possible that FLX has a protective effect on hippocampal
neurons in AD mice. Indeed, it has been demonstrated
that FLX not only attenuates deficits in neurogenesis in
the hippocampus [21-24], thereby producing a marked
improvement in hippocampal-dependent cognitive
impairment in neurodegenerative disorders such as
Huntington’s disease or ischemia [22, 24], but also
suppresses hippocampal neuronal death induced by
transient global ischemia or certain drugs, resulting in
marked improvements in memory impairments in mice or
rats [25-27]. We only found one report that addressed the
neurogenesis in female mice in a 3xTg model of AD after
FLX treatment. In that study, 9-month-old mice in a 3xTg
model of AD were given 1 month or 10 months of FLX
treatment. At 10 or 19 months, those mice treated with
FLX did not show neurogenesis in the DG [28]. However,
no study has used unbiased stereological methods to
precisely determine the actual total number of neurons in
the hippocampus after chronic treatment with FLX in the
middle to late stage of AD.
The activation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway
develops and maintains the nervous system [29-31].
Recent studies have shown that Wnt signaling is involved
in neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD [32-38].
In AD pathology, the level of glycogen synthase kinase3β (GSK-3β) in AD brains is considerably up-regulated
compared to that in healthy brains, while the level of
β-catenin is down-regulated [39]. Numerous reports
have demonstrated that the activation of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling increases hippocampal neurogenesis [40-43]
and protects hippocampal neurons from death [44-46] in
AD. Furthermore, Li et al. [47] have showed that FLX
greatly enhances the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, and
Pilar-Cuéllar et al. [48] have revealed that FLX increases
the β-catenin level. More recently, Hui et al. [49] have
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrated that the activation of GSK-3β/β-catenin
signaling might be the mechanism by which FLX
promotes neurogenesis in vitro. Nevertheless, to date, no
study has reported whether FLX acts through the canonical
Wnt signaling pathway to perform a neuroprotective role
in AD. Here, we hypothesized that FLX might play a
neuroprotective role in AD via the canonical Wnt signaling
pathway.
In this study, we evaluated the effect of FLX
treatment on APP/PS1 mice in the late stage of AD. The
spatial learning and memory abilities of middle-aged
APP/PS1 mice were evaluated using a Morris water
maze. Subsequently, we accurately determined the
number of neurons in the DG and in CA1 and CA3 of
the hippocampus in middle-aged AD mice using unbiased
stereological techniques. Additionally, we assessed
whether the neuroprotective activity of FLX in middleaged AD mice might be stimulated in part through the
activation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

RESULTS
Fluoxetine alleviates impairment of spatial
learning ability in middle-aged APP/PS1
transgenic mice
To investigate whether FLX treatment prevents
impairments in learning and memory abilities in AD
mice, three groups of mice were subjected to the Morris
water maze, which is a well-known test for evaluating
hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. In
the hidden platform trials, the APP/PS1 mice showed
significantly longer escape latencies (Figure 1A, P < 0.01).
However, the APP/PS1 mice in the FLX-treated (APP/
PS1+FLX) group showed significant improvements in
learning ability, with escape latencies that were markedly
shorter than those of the mice in the APP/PS1 group.
(Figure 1A, P < 0.05). In the subsequent probe task, the
platform was removed, and the mice were then tested to
determine whether they were capable of remembering
the location of the removed platform. Unexpectedly,
the frequency at which the mice crossed the platform
location was not statistically different between the APP/
PS1+FLX group and their control (APP/PS1) group
(Figure 1B, P > 0.05), and there was also no significant
difference between the WT and APP/PS1 groups (Figure
1B, P > 0.05). Despite these results, the FLX-treated APP/
PS1 mice were observed to follow tracks that were more
similar to those of the WT mice than those of the APP/
PS1 controls (Figure 1C). Additionally, the health of the
mice was closely supervised, and the body weights of the
mice were measured daily during treatment. No significant
differences were observed among the three groups of mice
(Figure 1D, P > 0.05).

in the hippocampus was higher and the labeling for beta
amyloid was more intense in the APP/PS1 group than in
the APP/PS1+FLX group (Figure 2). More specifically, the
hippocampal beta amyloid aggregates in the mice in the
APP/PS1+FLX group were more randomly scattered and
relatively fewer in number.

One of the major neuropathological hallmarks of
AD is the accumulation of beta amyloid in the brain [50].
The brain sections obtained from the APP/PS1 mice that
were treated with FLX for 5 weeks were subjected to
immunohistochemical analysis to evaluate the deposition
of beta amyloid. We found that there was little aggregation
of beta amyloid in the hippocampus in the WT mice, but in
the APP/PS1 and APP/PS1+FLX mice, beta amyloid was
observed to have aggregated in the hippocampus (Figure
2). Moreover, the density of beta amyloid aggregating

massive cell death [51]. To validate the hypothesis that
FLX alleviates cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice by

preventing the loss of neurons in the hippocampus, brain
tissues were processed using toluidine blue staining to
determine whether FLX increases the numbers of neurons
in the DG, CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus in APP/PS1
mice. We found, using unbiased stereological analysis, that
the total number of neurons in the DG of hippocampus in
mice in the APP/PS1+FLX group was significantly higher
than that in the APP/PS1 group (Figure 3A, 3B, P < 0.05).
In addition, the total number of neurons in the CA1 of
hippocampus in mice in the WT group was significantly
higher than that in the APP/PS1 and APP/PS1+FLX
group (Figure 3A, 3C, P < 0.05). However, the WT, APP/
PS1 and APP/PS1+FLX groups showed no significant
differences in the total numbers of neurons in the CA3 of
hippocampus (Figure 3A, 3D, P > 0.05).

As recent in vitro studies have shown that FLX may
activate the canonical Wnt pathway to rescue neuronal loss
[49], we investigated whether FLX activates canonical
Wnt signaling in APP/PS1 mice. Via western blot analysis,
the protein levels of GSK-3β, phosphorylated GSK3β (p-GSK-3β) and β-catenin in the hippocampus were
detected in each of the three groups. The level of p-GSK3β was higher in the APP/PS1+FLX mice than in the APP/
PS1 mice (Figure 4A, 4B, P < 0.05), but treatment with
FLX did not increase the total level of GSK-3β (Figure
4A, 4C, P > 0.05). Consequently, treatment with FLX
caused the ratio of p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β to be higher than

that in the control (Figure 4D, P < 0.05). In addition,
the level of β-catenin was significantly higher in APP/
PS1+FLX mice than in APP/PS1 mice (Figure 4E, 4F, P <
0.05). Collectively, these data indicate that treatment with
FLX stabilized the level of β-catenin in the hippocampus
of APP/PS1 mice.

When AD patients are clinically diagnosed,
AD is generally already in a middle to late stage. A
growing body of evidence indicates that characteristic
pathological changes appear in an APPswe/PSEN1dE9

been applied in several previous reports [24, 60-65]. For
example, Encinas et al. [61] and Li et al. [24] reported
that neurogenesis in the hippocampus was increased by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10 mg/kg FLX
once daily for 15 days or 4 weeks, producing a marked
improvement in hippocampal-dependent cognitive
impairment. Meanwhile, Malberg et al. [64] demonstrated
that chronic (14 or 28 d) but not short-term (1 or 5 d) FLX
treatment increased hippocampal neurogenesis. Therefore,
we chose the regime of 5 weeks and intraperitoneal (i.p.)
administration of 10 mg/kg FLX once daily.
In the present study, evaluation using the Morris
water maze showed that treatment with FLX effectively
improved the spatial learning ability in cognitively
impaired APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mice that were
16 to 17 months old. Consistent with previous reports, the
effect of FLX took time, and the APP/PS1 + FLX mice
did not show enhanced spatial learning ability on day 1
[19, 20]. Although FLX had positive effects on the spatial
learning ability of APP/PS1 mice, such that animals with
FLX remembered the location of the platform better and
more quickly than the APP/PS1 mice, animals treated with

FLX were still significantly slower than the WT mice,
and the spatial learning ability of FLX-treated APP/PS1
mice did not match that of the WT mice. However, our
behavioral test failed to detect any significant difference
in spatial memory ability between FLX-treated APP/PS1
mice and untreated APP/PS1 mice, in contrast to two
previous reports [19, 20]. One previous study showed
that when 2-month-old APPK670N/M671N(Swe)/PS1M146L AD
model mice were treated with FLX at 5 mg/kg/day in
their drinking water continuously for 7 months until
they reached 9 months of age, these 9-month-old mice
displayed significant improvements in spatial learning
and memory behaviors in the Morris water maze [20].
Another previous study showed that when 2-month-old
APPK670N/M671N/PS1M146L AD model mice were treated with
FLX at 5 mg/kg/day in their drinking water continuously
for 4 months until they reached 6 months of age, and these
6-month-old mice also exhibited significant improvements
in spatial learning and memory behaviors in the Morris
water maze [19]. The discrepancy in the effect of FLX on
the spatial memory ability of AD model mice between our
study and these two previous studies may be partly due to

Figure 5: The experimental design. A. The mice began to receive FLX treatment at 64-68 weeks (16-17 months) of age, and the

treatment was continued until they reached 69-73 weeks (17.25-18.25 months) of age, with the FLX administration lasting for 5 weeks.
The Morris water maze was conducted when mice were at 68-72 weeks (17-18 months) of age, after being administered fluoxetine for 4
weeks. B. Six mice each were randomly chosen from the WT group and the APP/PS1 group, and five mice were randomly chosen from the
APP/PS1+FLX group for the subsequent stereological investigation and immunohistochemistry. In each group, those mice not used for the
stereological investigation and immunohistochemistry were deeply anesthetized and then killed. Then, the hippocampus was obtained from
each brain and homogenized for western blotting analysis.

the following possible reasons. One reason is the age of
our mice; that is, 16- to 17-month-old AD mice may be too
old to experience amelioration of their memory abilities.
Another reason might be that the dose or the duration of
FLX administration may have been too low or slightly
too short, such that we may have potentially missed the
superior efficacy of FLX by not administering higher
doses, not using flexible dosing or not administering the
drug for slightly longer. A third possible reason might be
that the mice in the different studies expressed different
transgenes, which might have arrived at different results.
Because FLX improved the spatial learning in APP/
PS1 mice, we were curious as to whether FLX could
attenuate the aggregation of hippocampal beta amyloid.
Beta amyloid aggregates to form oligomers that are
toxic to neurons and are crucial to the progression of
AD [66]. The present results showed that FLX reduced
the deposition of beta amyloid in the hippocampus
of APP/PS1 mice, consistent with previous findings
[19, 20, 67, 68], suggesting that the ability of FLX to
alleviate cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice may depend
on decreasing the aggregation of beta amyloid in the
hippocampus. However, different researchers have
come to conflicting conclusions. Whether reducing beta
amyloid is beneficial to the pathogenesis of AD remains
controversial, given that several lines of evidence have
revealed that drugs targeting to clear the beta amyloid
protein plaques fail to improve cognition in AD patients
and may even result in terrible side effects, such as
skin cancer [69, 70]. Thus, determining whether other
potential neurobiological mechanisms may underlie the
improvements in cognition observed in the FLX-treated
APP/PS1 mice requires further study.
It is widely accepted that spatial learning and
memory are closely associated with the hippocampus
[71]. The hippocampus is generally considered to consist
of the DG, the hippocampus proper, which is composed
of the CA1, CA2 and CA3 fields, and the subiculum.
Previous studies have suggested that the memory deficits
and learning declines observed in elderly AD patients are
correlated with neuronal loss in the hippocampus [72,
73]. A growing body of evidence supports the view that
attenuation of neuronal loss in the hippocampus improves
cognitive impairments in AD models [9, 10]. Therefore,
in the current study, we used stereological methods to
accurately determine the numbers of neurons in the DG
and in CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus during the
late stage of AD to explore whether FLX ameliorates
the spatial learning deficit in a middle-aged AD mouse
model by protecting neurons in the hippocampus. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to adopt stereological
methods to accurately assess the number of neurons in
the hippocampus in middle-aged APP/PS1 mice that were
treated with FLX. Interestingly, we found that the numbers
of neurons in the CA1 and DG were significantly lower in
the APP/PS1 mice than in the WT mice. The decrease in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the numbers of neurons in CA1 and DG is in agreement
with previous studies reporting neuronal loss in CA1
[74-78] and DG [1, 77, 78] in AD. However, our data are
inconsistent with one recent study [79], which reported
that a significant reduction in neurons was only observed
in the subiculum of the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat
model of AD at 18 months of age [79]. This discrepancy
may be related to the differences in the transgenes and
strains of the animals studied. The McGill-R-Thy1-APP
transgenic rats possess only a single transgene, and in
these animals, the first Aβ plaque pathology is evident at
about 9 months of age in the subiculum [79], while our
APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice show Aβ plaque pathology as
early as at 4-6 months of age in the hippocampus [52-55].
Strikingly, Gan et al. [80] have reported that the number
of neural progenitor cells is significantly decreased at
the stages of Aβ plaque onset and progression. Heggland
et al. have considered that it is possible that at older
ages, cell loss would become apparent in other brain
areas in the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat, since
the progression of pathology is gradual [79]. They also
predicted that although rats, given their larger size as well
as more social and complex behaviors, are considered
to be physiologically and genetically closer to humans
than mice [81], neuronal loss has only been reported in
one rat transgenic model, the TgF344-AD line [82], and
transgenic mouse models have been more widely used in
studies.
Compared with the mice in the APP/PS1 group, the
FLX-treated APP/PS1 mice possessed significantly higher
numbers of neurons only in the DG. FLX administration
had no effect on neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions
of the hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice. Accordingly, we
propose that FLX improves the learning ability of APP/
PS1 mice by increasing the number of neurons in the DG
of the hippocampus. Intriguingly, throughout adulthood,
the mammalian brain retains the ability to produce new
neurons in two discrete regions, the subgranular zone
(SGZ) of the hippocampal DG and the subventricular
zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle [83-85]. Several
studies have shown that adult neurogenesis in the
hippocampal DG stimulates hippocampal function and
introduces the possibility of a new form of hippocampal
plasticity, especially hippocampus-dependent learning
and memory [83, 84, 86, 87]. Fitzsimons et al. [88] have
reviewed the idea that although the process of adult
neurogenesis is up-regulated in the early stage of AD,
the neurogenic capacity in AD is clearly insufficient to
compensate for the neuronal dysfunction or loss [89,
90]. Furthermore, Demars et al. [91] have reported that
APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice exhibit severe impairments in
hippocampal neurogenesis at as early as two months
of age. These decreases in neurogenesis within the DG
have been associated with cognitive impairments linked
with AD [92-95]. In addition, Boekhoorn et al. [96]
have reported that proliferation does occur in presenile

Alzheimer hippocampus (patients ranging from 63 to
70 years of age), and this proliferation reflects glial and
vascular-associated changes in the CA1-3 areas but not
neurogenesis in the DG. It is known that 1 month of
mouse life is roughly equivalent to 3.54 years of human
life; thus, our 16-17-month-old mice is roughly equivalent
to 56.64-60.18-year-old humans [97]. Therefore, it is
possible that neurogenesis did not occur in the DG of
the mice that we used. However, numerous reports have
demonstrated that stimulation of adult neurogenesis may
be an attractive therapeutic or preventative target to boost
the brain’s regenerative capacity, and that enhancement
of hippocampal neurogenesis might have therapeutic
potential in hippocampus-dependent learning and
memory in AD [11, 93-95, 98-100]. One recent report
has indicated that the improvement of neurogenesis with
genetic manipulation can rescue cognitive deficits in
8-9-month-old female APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice [95].
Our supposition is consistent with this result that FLX
might increase the number of DG neurons in APPswe/
PSEN1dE9 mice via enhancing neurogenesis, thereby
improving the spatial learning ability of APPswe/
PSEN1dE9 mice. Nevertheless, the increased number
of neurons in the DG might be attributed to two main
processes: the proliferation of new neurons (neurogenesis)
and increased neuronal survival through the attenuation
of neuronal cell death [9-12]. The main disadvantage
of our current study is that it was difficult to confirm
whether FLX increased the number of neurons in the DG
by enhancing neurogenesis, by preventing neurons from
dying, or through both processes. This question therefore
requires further investigation.
It is generally accepted that the inhibition of
Wnt signaling is involved in AD neurodegenerative
processes [33, 34] and that the activation of Wnt
signaling ameliorates neurodegeneration in AD [42, 46].
Importantly, it has been reported that FLX either inhibits
GSK-3β activity or enhances β-catenin activity [47, 48].
Furthermore, Valvezan and Klein [101] have reported that
p-GSK-3β promotes adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and
this might be required for the effects of FLX. Intriguingly,
the expression of Wnt-3a, which activates the canonical
Wnt signaling pathway, has been reported to be increased
by FLX [102]. Interestingly, Pinnock et al. [103] have
demonstrated that the neurogenesis-promoting effect of
FLX in the rat hippocampus is closely associated with the
up-regulation of Wnt-3a. Moreover, Alvarez et al. [104]
have reported that the canonical ligand Wnt-3a protects rat
hippocampal neurons from death induced by exposure to
Aβ. These findings suggest that the neuroprotective effect
of FLX might be related to the modulation of canonical
Wnt signaling. In the current study, we observed that
FLX, a classical SSRI, was involved in the activation of
Wnt signaling in middle-aged APP/PS1 AD model mice.
The present data revealed that FLX significantly inhibited
GSK-3β activity, increased the p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β ratio
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and stabilized the β-catenin level in vivo, indicating
that activation of the Wnt signaling pathway might be
involved in the neuroprotective effects of FLX that prevent
neuronal loss in AD, as has been proposed for the in vitro
neuroprotective effects [49]. Although these data provide
strong evidence of such involvement, it is possible that
other pathways, in addition to Wnt signaling, may also
mediate the neurogenic effects of FLX in vivo. Further
study is expected to clarify this issue.
In conclusion, chronic treatment with FLX had
a positive effect on cognition in middle-aged APP/PS1
transgenic AD model mice. In addition, this study is
the first one to use unbiased stereological methods to
accurately investigate the effect of FLX on the numbers of
neurons in the DG and in the CA1 and CA3 regions in the
middle-aged AD hippocampus. We demonstrated that FLX
increased the number of neurons in the hippocampal DG
in middle-aged APP/PS1 AD model mice. Furthermore,
the mechanism underlying the protective efficacy of FLX
is at least partly stimulated by the canonical Wnt signaling
pathway. However, additional investigations are required
in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying
the protective effect of FLX and to determine whether
there is an interaction between serotonin and the canonical
Wnt signaling pathway. In summary, we demonstrate that
FLX might have protective effects on cognition and on
neuronal numbers in the hippocampus of middle-aged
APPswe/PSEN1dE9 AD mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and drug treatment
Male APPswe/PSEN1dE9 double transgenic
Alzheimer’s Disease mice at the age of 16 to 17 months
old and their wild-type (WT) littermates were purchased
from the Animal Model Institute of Nanjing University
and housed 3-4 per cage, according to the National
Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 85-23). Food
and water were made available ad libitum, and the mice
were housed in a 12 h light-dark cycle at 21-25°C in
the Experimental Animal Center of Chongqing Medical
University, P. R. China.
Forty male APP/PS1 transgenic mice at the age of
16 to 17 months old were randomly assigned to receive
systemic administration of either fluoxetine (10 mg/kg
i.p. dissolved in 0.9 % NaCl; Sigma, USA) or vehicle
(equivalent volume of 0.9 % NaCl i.p.), for 20 mice in the
APP/PS1+FLX group and 20 mice in the APP/PS1 group,
and 20 male wild-type littermates, the WT group, were
assigned to receive systemic administration of vehicle
(equivalent volume of 0.9 % NaCl i.p.). The mice began
to receive FLX treatment (target dose: 10 mg/kg/day) at

64-68 weeks (16-17 months) of age, and the treatment was
continued until they reached 69-73 weeks (17.25-18.25
months) of age, with the FLX administration lasting for
5 weeks (Figure 5A). The regime of 5 weeks and the dose
of FLX were chosen based on previous reports [24, 6065]. All mice were treated once per day in the morning
between 9 AM and 10 AM for 5 consecutive weeks.

chosen from the WT group and 6 mice randomly chosen
from the APP/PS1 group, and 5 mice randomly chosen
from APP/PS+FLX group. All 17 of these mice were
perfused with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, pH =
7.4) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and their brains
were then removed and fixed in 4% PFA in PBS [106].
After adequate fixation, the left or right hemisphere
of each of the total 17 brains was sampled at random.
The sampled hemispheres were sectioned frozen on a
sliding microtome in the transverse plane at 50 µm, and
each brain was collected as 6 separate series in 4% PFA
(pH = 7.4). At least one series of brain sections from
each mouse was mounted as sectioned and stained with
toluidine blue. One or more series of brain sections were
immunohistochemically stained for beta amyloid using
a mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge,
England). (Figure 5B)
In each group, the mice not used for the stereological
investigation and immunohistochemistry were deeply
anesthetized via an i.p. injection of 1% pentobarbital
sodium and then sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and
their brains were promptly removed. The hippocampus
was obtained from each brain and homogenized via
sonication on ice in lysis buffer. Then, the homogenate
was centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The
supernatants were collected, and the total protein levels
were measured by using a BCA protein assay kit. Then,
the supernatants were heated to 95-100 °C for 5 min,
cooled on ice for a little while, and then stored at 4 °C
until western blot analysis. (Figure 5B)

Morris water maze
After four weeks of FLX treatment when mice were
at 68-72 weeks (17-18 months) of age, during the fifth
week of FLX treatment, the spatial learning and memory
abilities of the three groups of mice were tested using a
Morris water maze, as described previously by our team
[105] (Figure 5A). Briefly, the Morris water maze test
consists of the hidden platform trials and the probe tasks.
Spatial learning ability was tested with the hidden platform
trials for five successive days. Each day, a hidden platform
trial was initiated by randomly placing a mouse, facing
the maze wall, into one of the four quadrants of the maze,
with each of the four quadrants used once daily. The trial
was terminated automatically when the mouse reached the
platform or after 60 s. Then, the mouse was allowed to
stay on the platform for 10 s. If the mouse did not find
the platform within 60 s, it was guided to the platform.
Memory ability was tested the next day, after five days
of hidden platform trials, with the probe tasks performed
in the same water maze. In the probe tasks, unlike in the
hidden platform trials, the platform was removed, and the
mice entered the water from two farthest points away from
the platform location in two quadrants and were allowed
to swim freely for 60 s. In the hidden platform trials, the
escape latencies were recorded using a computerized
tracking system, while in the probe tasks, the frequency
of crossing the platform location and the swimming tracks
were monitored. Only 35 mice successfully completed the
behavioral experiment (12 mice in the WT group, 13 mice
in the APP/PS1 group, and 10 mice in the APP/PS1+FLX
group).

Immunohistochemistry
Sections were rinsed 3 times in 0.01 M PBS/0.3%
Triton X-100 and then incubated in 3% H2O2 for 15 min
with gentle agitation. The sections were then blocked to
prevent nonspecific antigen binding in 4% BSA/0.1%
Triton X-100/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Blocking
was followed by overnight incubation with primary
antibodies (anti-amyloid, 1:50; or anti-actin, 1:1000; see
Table 1) at 4 °C. The sections were then rinsed 3 times
in 0.1 M PBS and incubated with biotinylated horse antimouse IgG (1:500 in PBS, ZSGB-BIO, SP-9002) for 1
h at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were
treated with streptavidin avidin-biotin enzyme complex

(S-A/HRP, ZSGB-BIO, SP-9002) for 1 h. The labeling
was visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB, ZSGBBIO, ZLI-9018). The sections were rinsed, successively
dehydrated in 95% and 100% ethyl alcohol, cleared in
xylene and coverslipped with Permount in a fume hood.
In addition, some of the sections were stained using the
same procedure without beta amyloid antibody to verify
the staining specificity of the antibody.

to those in the regio inferior but more loosely arranged
(Figure 6A) [79, 107].

Estimation of neuronal numbers in the DG and in
CA1 and CA3
Under an oil objective lens, an unbiased counting
frame was superimposed on each optical section. The area
of the unbiased counting frame was set as 913.65 μm2
for neurons in the DG and CA1 and CA3 regions of the
hippocampus. Since every six sections were sampled in
a systematic and random fashion, the section sampling
fraction (ssf) was 1/6. The area sampling fraction (asf)
was set to 0.0004. The dissector height was set to 15 μm
and was centered in the tissue to ensure that the heights of
guard zones on the top and bottom surfaces of the tissue
were 3 μm. The average section thickness was 19 μm.
Therefore, the fraction of the section thickness (tsf) was
equal to 15/19.
Based on the above parameters set in the stereology
analysis system, a three-dimensional probe (optical
dissector) was used to directly count the number of
neuronal nuclei in a known fraction of the volume of the
DG, CA1 or CA3 (Figure 6A). When the microscopic field
of vision was clearly focused for the first time, its location
on the Z axis was set to 0. Then, as the microscope was
adjusted, the neurons within the guard zones were not
counted (Figure 6B). Thereafter, as the Z axis moved
below the guard zones, if the nuclei of neurons came into
focus and did not touch the forbidden lines of the unbiased
counting frame, those nuclei were counted (Figure 6C).
Glial cells were not counted, and they were differentiated
from neurons based on morphological criteria, especially
the absence of a large nucleus. The precise rules for
sampling and obtaining unbiased estimates of the number
of neurons, N, have been described previously [79, 107,
109, 110].
N(total) = ΣQ— × 1/ssf × 1/asf × 1/tsf
where N is the total number of neurons in the
hippocampal DG, CA1 or CA3. ΣQ— denotes the total
number of neurons counted in the DG, CA1 or CA3 of the
hippocampus per mouse.

Stereology
General
Unbiased stereological estimates of neuron numbers
were obtained by using a stereology system (New CAST,
Denmark). An Olympus Optiphot microscope was
equipped with a motorized stage that allowed precise,
automatic movements in the X and Y directions (ProScan,
H101A, Britain), a video camera (Olympus, DP71,
Japan) to project images onto the computer screen, and
a microcator (ProScan, Britain) that was attached to the
stage to obtain a precise measurement of the focal depth
(in 0.1 μm). The total numbers of neurons in the DG and in
CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus were estimated under
a 100x oil objective lens (N.A. 1.40) using the optical
fractionators [107].
Anatomical boundaries of the DG, CA1 and CA3
Stereological analysis was performed using six mice
randomly chosen from the WT group, six mice randomly
chosen from the APP/PS1 group, and five mice randomly
chosen from the APP/PS1+FLX group. The left or right
hemisphere was chosen randomly from each mouse. Each
hemisphere was cut along the coronal plane, from the
caudal cut surface of every brain slice, into 50-µm-thick
successive slabs (12 ± 0.5 slabs/hemisphere), followed
by staining with toluidine blue. Each whole slab was
scanned under low magnification (4x objective). While
using the 4x objective lens, contours were traced around
the edges of the DG, CA1 and CA3, based on the borders
shown in Paxinos and Franklin’s mouse brain atlas [108]
and a report by Heggland et al. [79]. The borders were
determined using cytoarchitectonic features in sections
stained with toluidine blue.
The DG region, which is horseshoe-shaped in crosssection, contains the most densely packed and smallest
neuronal cell bodies in the hippocampus. Because the
layers in the DG are not in immediate contact with layers
in other regions, the DG can be easily defined (Figure 6A).
The CA1 region can be roughly defined from CA2 subfield
and the prosubiculum. The pyramidal neurons in CA1 are
thin, homogeneously sized and smaller than those in the
CA2 and CA3 regions (Figure 6A). The CA3 region is
divided into two main components that are roughly the
same in size. The regio inferior is a tightly packed layer.
The end of the regio superior is defined by a transition
zone containing large pyramidal neurons that are similar

Western blot analysis
The hippocampus obtained from the mice were
homogenized using sonication on ice in a lysis buffer
containing 200 mM PMSF in DMSO, a protease inhibitor
cocktail in DMSO, 100 mM sodium orthovanadate in
water, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Then, the
homogenates were centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min at
4°C, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants
were then quantified by using BCA assays.
Protein samples (45 μg or 80 μg/sample) were
electrophoresed using 8%, 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE

and then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore,
USA). Next, the membranes were blocked in 5% bull
serum albumin (BSA) at 37°C for 2 h and then incubated
in primary antibodies against GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β or
β-catenin at 4°C overnight (see Table 1). On the following
day, after being thoroughly washed with TBST (TBS with
0.1% Tween 20), each membrane was incubated with the
respective HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at 37°C
for 1 h. The protein bands were visualized by using an
ECL Prime kit (Millipore, USA).
