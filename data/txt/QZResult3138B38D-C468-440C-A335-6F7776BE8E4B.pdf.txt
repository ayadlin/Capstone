ABSTRACT
VitaminD3 signaling is involved in inhibiting the development and progression of
gastric cancer (GC), while the active vitamin D metabolite 1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 (1,25(OH)2D3)-mediated gene regulatory mechanisms in GC remain unclear. We
found that miR-145 is induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in a dose- and vitamin D receptor (VDR)dependent manner in GC cells. Inhibition of miR-145 reverses the antiproliferative
effect of 1,25(OH)2D3. Furthermore, miR-145 expression was lower in tumors
compared with matched normal samples and correlated with increased the E2F3
transcription factor protein staining. Overexpression of miR-145 inhibited colony
formation, cell viability and induced cell arrest in S-phase in GC cells by targeting
E2F3 and CDK6. miR-145 inhibition consistently abrogates the 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated
suppression of E2F3, CDK6, CDK2 and CCNA2 genes. Altogether, our results indicate
that miR-145 mediates the antiproliferative and gene regulatory effects of vitamin
D3 in GC cells and might hold promise for prognosis and therapeutic strategies for
GC treatment.

The most active vitamin D3 metabolite 1alpha,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) affects cancer
development and growth through regulating multiple
signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation,
apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis [3–5]. 1,25(OH)2D3
(also known as calcitriol) functions by binding to and
activating nuclear vitaminD receptor (VDR), which
is a ligand-modulated transcription factor that binds
to specific sequences (vitamin D response elements
(VDRE)) in target genes and increases or decreases their
transcription rate through interaction with a vast array of
co-activators, co-repressors, chromatin modifier enzymes,
and remodeling complexes [6]. Thereby, nearly 3–5%
of human genes are regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 directly
or indirectly, these include miRNAs, which play very
important roles in cancer development [7–9].

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer (GC) is currently the fourth most
common malignancy in the world. It can spread throughout
the stomach and to other organs, including the esophagus,
lungs, lymph nodes or liver. While the etiology of GC
carcinogenesis is thought to be multifactorial, molecular
analysis coupled with genome-wide approaches has
identified various genetic alterations related to gastric
tumorigenesis and progression [1]. Recently, the correlation
between vitamin D3 and microRNAs (miRNAs) has open
new opportunities for cancer research, including GC
research.
Epidemiology studies showed that vitamin D
insufficiency or deficiency increases cancer incidence,
particularly for cancers of the digestive system [2].

miRNAs are known as master gene regulators by
base pairing with mRNAs, leading to mRNA inhibition
or destabilization. Deregulation of certain miRNAs may
contribute to human cancer and miRNAs function as tumor
suppressors or oncogenes in cancer cells [10]. Generally,
miRNAs target multiple mRNAs. An individual miRNA
could potentially alter complex cellular processes such as
cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis and invasion. Aberrant
miRNA levels are observed in many tumors, and some
deregulated miRNAs such as miR-338-3p, miR-204, miR508-5p, miR-16, miR-21, miR-27a, and miR-19b/20a/92a
have been identified in GC [1, 11–17].
Data suggest that serum vitamin D level is a
significant independent prognostic factor in patients with
GC, and that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with
poor prognosis [18]. In this study, we show that miR145 is deregulated in GC and induced by 1,25(OH)2D3.
We aim to confirm and extend our findings through the
identification of target miRNAs for 1,25(OH)2D3, and to
analyze their biological mechanism in GC.

of miR-145 was significantly increased by three folds
(Figure 2B). Therefore we further studied the role of miR145 in 1,25(OH)2D3 antitumor activity. To validate the cell
function affected by the change of miR-145 expression
regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3, the MTT assay showed that
when miR-145 was inhibited, anti-proliferative effect of
1,25(OH)2D3 decreased (Figure 2C). To determine if VDR
was required for miR-145 expression, we transfected a
small hairpin RNA against VDR, sh-VDR and a control
shRNA into SGC-7901 cells, VDR mRNA and protein
expression level were low compared with those of
the control shRNA transfected cells (Supplementary
Figure 1). As shown in Figure 2D, miR-145 levels were
decreased in sh-VDR transfected cells. When sh-VDR
transfected cells were treated with 0.2 μmol 1,25(OH)2D3,
miR-145 expression level were rescued, but not totally
(Figure 2D). We predicted a candidated VDRE at the
upstream of miR-145 locus of human chromosome 5
(named as miR-145-VDRE) by bioinformatics based
on the known VDRE motif sequences (Figure  2E). To
validate our hypothesis that the VDRE interacts with the
VDR in vivo, we conducted ChIP assay in SGC-7901
cells. qRT-PCR analysis showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 induced
a significant increase of miR-145-VDRE using DNA
purified from ChIP assay (Figure 2G). Antibodies against
the VDR precipitated genomic DNA fragments miR-145VDRE in cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3, and no DNA
was detected in IgG precipitates (Figure 2F), showing that
the recruitments between VDR and the miR-145-VDRE
was induced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Based on these findings,
we concluded that miR-145 is induced through VDR and
which is critical for 1,25(OH)2D3 actions.

RESULTS
1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits GC cell proliferation
To examine the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on GC
cells, SGC-7901 and AGS cells were treated with various
doses of 1,25(OH)2D3. The MTT assay indicated that
1,25(OH)2D3 significantly suppressed cell growth and
mostly reached a plateau at the 500 nmol dose point when
compared with the control group in vitro in both cell
lines (Figure 1A and 1B). We then studied the potential
mechanism of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced growth suppression.
The cells were incubated in serum-free medium to
synchronize them in the G1 phase. 1,25(OH)2D3 slightly
decreased the percentage of cells in the S phase in
SGC-7901 cells while no obvious change in AGS cells
(Figure 1C and 1D). In addition, annexin V staining
analysis dispalyed that 1,25(OH)2D3 promoted cancer cell
apoptosis, which is consistent with the study of vitamin
D-induced apoptosis through PTEN upregulation [19]
(Figure 1E and 1F). Based on these findings, we concluded
that 1,25(OH)2D3 could regulate GC cell proliferation and
apoptosis.

miR-145 is frequently downregulated in GC
tissues and cell lines
In our previous miRNA microarray analysis, we
found that miR-145 was reduced in GC tissues compared
with normal gastric tissues [20]. To confirm and extend
this finding, we examined the expression of miR-145
in 20 pairs of GC and normal tissues (Supplementary
Table 1), and four human gastric cell lines including
SGC-7901, AGS, BGC-823, MKN-45 and normal GES-1
by qRT-PCR. miR-145 was significantly downregulated in
15 of 20 (75%) cancer samples (Figure 3A). Additionally,
all four gastric cancer cell lines showed > 50% reduction
compared with normal cells (Figure 3B). miR-145
reduction suggests that it may act as a tumor suppressor
in GC.

1,25(OH)2D3 induces miR-145 expression, which
mediates the antitumor activity of 1,25(OH)2D3
To understand the mechanism involved in
1,25(OH)2D3 cancer growth inhibition, the effects of
1,25(OH)2D3 on miRNA expression in human GC were
analyzed. The expression of several miRNAs in RNA
samples extracted from SGC-7901 and AGS cells treated
with 0.2 μmol 1,25(OH)2D3 or blank control was analyzed
by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) (Figure 2A). Among them, the expression level

miR-145 inhibitor, and control oligos into the SGC7901 and AGS cell lines. qRT-PCR was then performed
to validate miR-145 expression after transfection. miR145 expression level was increased 200-fold 48 h after
transfection of the miR-145 expression vector and almostly
no fold change after miR-145 inhibitor tranefection
(Figure 4A). The MTT assay and colony formation assay
dispalyed a significant inhibition of cell growth and colony
formation after miR-145 transfection when compared with
cells transfected with the empty vector (control) in both
cell lines, but increased by transfecting miR-145 inhibitor
(Figure 4B and 4C; Supplementary Figure 2A–2D). We
then study the impact of miR-145 on cell cycle progression.
Both cell lines showed overexpression of miR-145 caused
the accumulation of cells in the S phase and a corresponding
reduction of cells in the G2/M phase, it’s consistent there
was a decrease percentage of cells in S phase when
transfected miR-145 inhibitor (Figure 4D; Supplementary
Figure 2E and 2F). These results suggested that miR-145
blocked the S/G2 transition in GC cells in vitro.

species. E2F3 is an important cell cycle regulation gene
that is highly expressed in GC tissues (Figure 5C and
5D). Next, we determined whether ectopic expression
of miR-145 suppressed endogenous E2F3 at the protein
level by western blot. As shown in Figure 6D, miR-145
suppressed both E2F3 and CDK6. miR-145 also induced
downregulation of CDK2 and CCNA2, which are vital
cell cycle regulators (Figure 6D). Interestingly, miR-145
expression level in vivo was inversely-correlated with
E2F3 mRNA expression level, which was verified by
Pearson’s correlation coefficient test (Figure 5E). Taken
together, our data demonstrated that miR-145 target
E2F3 and CDK6 directly and suppress their expression at
translation level in SGC-7901 cells.

Effect of E2F3 knockdown on cell growth and
proliferation in the GC cell line SGC-7901
Having validated E2F3 as a direct target of miR145, we further determined the role of E2F3 in miR145 mediated suppression of cell proliferation. We next
established that the inhibition of cell proliferation involved
E2F3 dependent cell cycle regulation. The effect of E2F3
knockdown in SGC-7901 cells was analyzed. si-E2F3
and control siRNA were transfected into SGC-7901
cells. E2F3 mRNA and protein expression levels were
both decreased in si-E2F3 transfected cells compared
to those of si-control transfected cells (Figure 6A). The
MTT assay revealed a significant cellgrowth inhibition
of si-E2F3 transfected cells in comparison with that of
si-control transfected cells (Figure 6B). Moreover, E2F3
knockdown also induced the accumulation of cells in the
S phase, as did miR-145 overexpression (Figure 6C).
Consistent with miR-145 ectopic expression, si-E2F3
affected the protein expression level of CDK2 and cyclin
A2 (CCNA2) (Figure 6D). These data indicated that miR145 targeting of E2F3 was responsible for the inhibition
of cell proliferation, suggesting a novel therapeutic
application for GC treatment.

E2F3 and CDK6 are both direct targets of miR-145
To understand the mechanism of miR-145-induced
inhibition of cell proliferation in GC, miR-145 targets were
identified using computer-aided miRNA target prediction
programs, such as TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/)
and other miRBase linked websites (http://www.mirbase.
org/). Four putative miR-145 target genes that might play a
role in cell proliferation were identified, including CDK6,
E2F3, CCND2, and ERBB4, as shown in Figure 5A, the
binding sites at E2F3 and CDK6 3’-untranslated region
(UTR) were displayed. Luciferase reporter assays showed
that two of them, CDK6 and E2F3, induced 70% and
60% reduction in luciferase activity compared with vector
control, respectively (Figure 5B). We focused on E2F3
because CDK6 has been reported as a target of miR-145
in colon cancer [1]. The miR-145 target sequence in the
3’ - UTR of E2F3 is highly conserved in human and other

DISCUSSION

and Bcl2 in the extracellular matrix remodeling [28]. In
our study, we also found that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits cell
proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis in two GC cell
lines (Figure 1). VDREs have only been identified in the
precursor sequences of miR-98 and miR-498 [21, 28] and
the expression of both miRNAs is increased via VDRE in
prostate and breast cancer. Only few other miRNAs, whose
expression is increased or decreased by 1,25(OH)2D3, but
not through VDR, were identified [22, 29, 30]. In our study,
among the miRNA analyzed, miR-145 is significantly
induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in GC cells (Figure 2A). miR-145
expression level was rescued when the sh-VDR transfected
cells were treated with 1,25(OH)2D3, indicating that VDR
is required for the activation of miR-145 expression
(Figure 2D). Indeed, A VDRE, a cis-acting element at the
upstream sequence of miR-145, was identified and verified
by CHIP assay (Figure 2F). Thus, miRNA regulation
participates and plays an important mediater role in the
anticancer actions of 1,25(OH)2D3.
Deregulation of miRNAs has been reported in
many types of human disorders, including cancer. Earlier

1,25(OH)2D3 and vitaminD signaling play a crucial
role in inhibiting the development and progression of
multiple cancers and miRNAs might be key mediators of
1,25(OH)2D3 anticancer functions [21, 22]. In our study,
we first identified that miR-145 is induced by 1,25(OH)2D3
and mediatesthe antiproliferative and gene regulatory
effects of vitaminD in GC.
Preclinical studies in cells and animal models support
the hypothesis that 1,25(OH)2D3 could inhibit cancer
development and progression and circulating vitamin D
concentration level has been associated with an increased
risk for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer [23–25].
A previous study demonstrated that up to 57.9% patients
with GC were deficient in vitamin D and that vitamin
D3 can induce apoptosis in GC cells [26]. Some studies
suggest that vitamin D may prevent GC from progressing
by modulating the extracellular microenvironment. In
fact, vitamin D has been shown to alter the expression
of multiple genes such as patched1, Gli1, cyclin D1,

studies showed that miR-145 is commonly downregulated
in cancer and miR-145 overexpression could inhibit
not only cell proliferation, but also cell invasion and
metastasis by targeting multiple cancer related genes
[31–37]. Consistent with these studies, we found that
miR-145 is downregulated in GC through our earlier
miRNA microarray study [20]. We further confirmed that
miR-145 is accurately suppressed in GC tissues and cell
lines by qRT-PCR and believed that miR-145 functions as
a suppressor in GC. In a series of cell experiments, gain
and loss of function studies showed that miR-145 could
inhibit cell proliferation by stopping cells in the S phase
and blocking the S/G2 transition in vitro. Our luciferase
assay showed that E2F3 is a direct target of miR-145.
CDK6 is also a direct target of miR-145 in GC. Another
team confirmed its expression in colon cancer [38].
miR-145 transfection inhibited E2F3 and CDK6 protein
expression and E2F3-regulated cell cycle genes such as
CDK2 and CCNA2 were inhibited. Our results highlight
the significance of miR-145 as a tumor suppressor in cell
proliferation by targeting E2F3 in GC.
E2F3, a member of E2F family of transcription
factors, is known as a potent regulator of the cell cycle
and apoptosis with the capacity to stimulate quiescent cells
to proliferate or to induce cell apoptosis. Deregulation
of E2F3, either overexpression [39] or inactivation by
repressor mechanisms [40], is a frequent oncogenic
event in human tumorigenesis. The human E2F3 mRNA
contains multiple regulatory features within a long 3’UTR, including a large number of miRNA seed sequences,
two PRE motifs, two NRE motifs, and several alternative
polyadenylation signals. It has been shown that some
miRNAs that target E2F3 such as 200b,125b, and 503a
are downregulated [41, 42]. In our study, we also showed

that E2F3 was overexpressed in GC tissues and cell
lines. Its expression was inverselycorrelated with that of
miR-145. E2F3 inhibition by siRNA had the same effect
on GC cell growth than miR-145 overexpression. These
results indicate that miR-145 functional roles involve the
E2F3 signaling pathway. Together with miR-145, which
has multiple target genes involved in cell cyclesuch as
CDK6, c-Myc, and EGFR, E2F3 affects a number of genes
involved in cell cycle progression, including cyclinE,
cyclinA2, CDC2, b-Myb, and E2F1, whose transcription
is downregulated in E2f3+/-cell lines that presented no
detectable cell cycle defect [43]. Thus, two groups of
genes in the cell cycle network are linked by the direct
correlation between miR-145 and E2F3. Additionally,
miR-145 inhibits E2F3 expression in vitro. A study shows
that miR-145 could be reversely regulated by E2F3
[44]. It indicates that miR-143/-145 display significantly
downregulation in E2F-deficient cells, despite the lack of
acute induction in E2F-inducible cell lines. According to
the literature, cell cycle arrest may be a prerequisite step for
initiating terminal differentiation. Although G1 arrest has
been the center of attention in differentiation, some reports
indicatedthe involvement of G2 and S-phase arrest. Thus,
our results (cells accumulating in S-phase) can explain why
some clusters may accumulate in several cell cycle phases,
but are not significantly induced during the early exit from
quiescence. The question of how E2F3 is overexpressed
in GC is still open, but one possible mechanism is through
regulation of miR-145 aberrant expression.
In summary, we identified miR-145 as a novel
target of 1,25(OH)2D3 in human GC. In addition, E2F3
and CDK6, the direct targets of miR-145, as well as their
downstream cell cycle genes (CDK2 and CCNA2) are
downregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Figure 7A). Above all,

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qRT- PCR

we provide a novel evidence that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits cell
proliferation in human cancer. miR-145, which presents
multiple gene regulatory effects in human cancer, was
identified as a direct target of 1,25(OH)2D3. Our results
provide new insights on the vitamin D pathway in GC
(Figure 7B). A further challenge will be to identify more
targets of 1,25(OH)2D3 and to elucidate its inhibitory
effects on GC.

Total RNA was extracted from prepared gastric
samples with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA)
reagent and cDNA was synthesized according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (MBI Fermentas). Quantitative
RT-PCR was performed using a standard SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), and PCRspecific amplification was conducted in the Applied
Biosystems (ABI7500) real-time PCR machine. The
relative expression of genes (miR-145, U6, E2F3, VDR,
GAPDH ) was calculated with the 2−(ΔΔCt) method
(Livak and Schmittgen 2001). The primers used are listed
here (Supplementary Table 3).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical cases
Paired GC and adjacent non-tumor gastric tissues
were collected from patients who had undergone surgical
gastric resection at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an
Jiaotong University. No local or systemic treatment had
been conducted before operation. Tissue samples were
immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen until RNA
extraction. Both tumor and non-tumor tissues were
histologically confirmed. Informed consent was obtained
from each patient and was approved by the Institute Research
Ethics Committee at Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University.

MTT assay
Gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells were seeded into
96-well plates at 5 × 103 cell/well in 200 μl/well culture
medium (RPMI1640), and cultured 24 h, 48 h, 72 h after
treated or transfected with calcitriol (Cayman) or vector
control, miR-145 expression vector, inhibitor control and
miR-145 inhibitor. Before the indicated time, 20 μl MTT
(Sigma) was added to each well. Then the plates were
incubated at 37°C for 4 hour. Cell viability was assayed on
FLUO star OPTIMA (BMG). Each experiment contained
three replicates and was repeated at least three times.

Cell lines and gene transfer
Four human gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901,
AGS, BGC-823, MKN-45 and one common cell line GES1 were obtained from freeze-stored cells in our Biomedical
Reasearch Center, medical school of Xi’an JiaoTong
University. All cell lines were maintained in RPIM1640
(Hyclone), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, PAA
Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria) with 100 units/

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays,
SGC-7901 cells were treated with 500 nM 1,25(OH)2D3
(Cayman, USA) for 48 hours and cross-linked with
formaldehyde (endconcentration = 1%) for 15 min at
room temperature, and the reactions were quenched
with glycine (0.125M) for 30 min. Rinse the cells twice
with 5 mL 1x PBS. Harvest cells and then nuclei were
resuspended by Mg-NI, Mg-NI-XP40, Ca-NI (0.5M
EGTA additon) and lysis buffer (Protease inhibitor stock
addtion) in turn. Then a sonicator was used to shear the
cross-linked DNA to an average length of 100 to 500 bp
and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm to remove insoluble
material. Sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated
with 1 μg of anti-VDR or IgG antibody (Abcam, USA)
overnight at 4°C. The immunocomplexes were collected
with 40 μl Protein G agarose (Invitrogen, USA) and slurry
for 2 hour at 4°C. The beads were washed and reverse
the cross-links with proteinase K by incubating at 65°C
for 8  hour. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform
(Invitrogen, USA) extraction and ethanol precipitation
and used as the template for quantitative real-time PCR
with the primer sets for ChIP-PCR assay (Supplementary
Table 3).
