Abstract
Dasatinib is a multitargeted kinase inhibitor that was recently
approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia
and Philadelphia chromosome–positive acute lymphoblastic
leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. It is
also in clinical trials for treating patients with solid tumors.
The identification of molecular markers predictive of response
to dasatinib could assist in clinical development by selecting
patients most likely to derive clinical benefit. Using baseline
gene expression profiling of a panel of 23 breast cancer cell
lines, we identified genomic signatures highly correlated with
in vitro sensitivity to dasatinib. The ability of these signatures
to predict dasatinib sensitivity was further confirmed and
validated in independent test cell lines. A six-gene model was
used to correctly predict dasatinib sensitivity in 11 out of 12
(92%) additional breast and 19 out of 23 (83%) lung cancer cell
lines. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical
assays further confirmed the differential expression pattern
of selected markers. Finally, these gene signatures were
observed in a subset of primary breast, lung, and ovarian
tumors suggesting potential utility in patient selection. The
subset of breast cancer patients expressing the dasatinibsensitive signature includes a distinct clinical and molecular
subgroup: the so-called ‘‘triple negative’’ (i.e., estrogen
receptor–negative, progesterone receptor–negative, and
HER2-negative) or ‘‘basal’’ breast cancer subtype. This patient
population has a poor prognosis and currently has few
effective treatment options. Our results implicate that
dasatinib may represent a valuable treatment option in this
difficult-to-treat population. To test this hypothesis, clinical
studies are now under way to determine the activity of
dasatinib in these patients. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2226–38]

Introduction
Utilizing the wealth of information gathered on cancer targets in
the so-called ‘‘genomics age,’’ effective targeted therapies have been
developed that benefit at least some subsets of patients. Targeting
the subset of patients that will benefit should be the developmental
goal for such agents. Therefore, new prognostic and predictive
molecular markers are needed to accurately predict a patient’s

response to the therapies in development. Such markers would
better assess a patient’s sensitivity to a specific therapy, thus
facilitating the individualization of therapy. Previous efforts to use
genetic information to predict drug sensitivity have primarily
focused on individual genes such as HER2, EGFR , and UGT (1–4).
More recently, gene expression profiling studies have shown the
advantages of genomic ‘‘signatures’’ or marker sets generated by
microarray analysis in classifying tumors (5–7), predicting clinical
outcome (8, 9), and chemotherapeutic response (10–13). These
findings provide hope that cancer treatments of the future will be
vastly improved by molecular markers that will enable patient
targeting.
Agents targeting novel genes could greatly benefit from such a
targeted approach. The SRC tyrosine kinase was the first protooncogene described and functions at the hub of a vast array of
signal transduction cascades that influence cellular proliferation,
differentiation, motility, and survival. SRC has been found to be
overexpressed and activated in a large number of cancers,
including breast cancer (14), and it has been linked to progression
and metastasis in breast cancer (15). Accumulative results suggest
SRC as a potential target for designing therapeutics (16, 17), but
agents targeting SRC have only been in clinical use since 2003.
Dasatinib is a novel, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor that
targets important oncogenic pathways, including SRC family
kinases (SFK) and BCR-ABL (18). In preclinical models, it has
shown potent antitumor activity in both in vitro cell lines and
in vivo xenografts (19–23). The results from clinical trials have
shown that dasatinib is an effective agent for the treatment of
patients with imatinib-refractory chronic myelogenous leukemia
and Philadelphia chromosome–positive ALL (24). Dasatinib was
recently approved for both indications and is in clinical trials for
the treatment of solid tumors.
To support the clinical development of dasatinib, we sought to
identify molecular markers predictive of response to this drug that
could be used for patient selection during clinical development and
beyond. One of challenges is to determine the targeted patient
population for the drug before clinical data is available. To
overcome this challenge, we generated genomic data in cancer cell
lines and correlated it with in vitro response to dasatinib to identify
candidate markers that may predict response to this therapeutic.
We then confirmed and validated the predictive power of the gene
signatures in additional cell lines. Finally, we explored the potential
utility of the gene signatures in selecting patients likely to respond
to dasatinib treatment and identify a target population to be ‘‘triple
negative’’ or ‘‘basal’’ breast cancer subtype. Simultaneously and
independently, Finn et al. observed that dasatinib preferentially
inhibited the growth of basal-type breast cancer cell lines (25).
Clinical studies are now under way to determine the activity of
dasatinib in these patient populations.

Predictive Markers for Dasatinib Sensitivity

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), except H3396, which was obtained from
Pacific Northwest Research Institute (Seattle, WA). The MCF7/Her2 cell line
was established by stable transfection of MCF7 cells with the HER2 gene.
Cells were maintained at 37jC under standard cell culture conditions.
In vitro cytotoxicity assay. Cells were plated at 4,000 cells per well in
96-well microtiter plates and incubated overnight, then exposed to a serial
dilution of dasatinib. After 72 h, cytotoxicity testing was done using MTS
assay (26) to determine the sensitivity of cell lines to dasatinib. The results
were expressed as an IC50, which is the drug concentration required to
inhibit cell proliferation to 50% of that of untreated control cells. The mean
IC50 and SD from multiple tests for each cell line were calculated.
Gene expression profiling. RNA was isolated from the cultured cells
at f70% confluence using the RNeasy kits from Qiagen (Valencia, CA).
Ten micrograms of total RNA from each cell line was used to prepare
biotinylated probe according to the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression
Analysis Technical Manual, 2001. Targets were hybridized to Affymetrix
high-density oligonucleotide array human HG-U133 set chips (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA). The arrays were then washed and stained using the
GeneChip Fluidics station according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Data analysis. The expression data on the 23 breast cell lines (training
data set; GSE6569) was preprocessed as described in Supplementary
Information. The normalized data set was used to select probe sets, the
expression level of which correlated with the sensitivity of cells to dasatinib
using three statistical methods. First, probe sets were ranked according to
their differential expression between sensitive and resistant classes using a
signal-to-noise (S2N) metric implemented in the GeneCluster 2.0 software
described previously (27, 28). The statistical significance of these gene
expression correlations was determined from 1,000 permutation tests to
select the top 400 probe sets with P < 0.05. Second, the Pearson coefficient
of correlation r between the IC50 values of these 23 breast cell lines and
the expression level of each probe set was calculated. The probe sets with
r > 0.4 or r < 0.4 (P < 0.05) were identified and considered as significant.
Finally, a Welch t test was done and the probe sets with P < 0.01 were
selected. The probe sets that overlapped between these three statistical
methods represent genes significantly correlated with the dasatinib
sensitivity/resistance classification.
To further evaluate the predictive ability of the genes identified from the
23 breast cancer cell lines, the expression levels of which are highly
correlated with the sensitivity/resistance classification to dasatinib, the
weighted-voting algorithm (27, 28) implemented in the GeneCluster 2.0
software was used to predict the sensitivity phenotype of the independent
data sets. The complete description of the weighted voting method on how
a model is built and how prediction can be made on new cases was
described previously (refs. 27, 28; and also available in Supplementary
Information).
Quantitative real-time PCR. Confirmation of the expression levels
of six selected genes identified by microarray analysis was carried out
by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). cDNA (25 ng) from each
sample was amplified with specific primers using the SYBR green Core
Reagents kit and a 7900HT real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The expression of each gene was standardized using
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a reference gene, and
relative expression levels for the panel of cell lines were quantified by
calculating 2 DDCT, where DDCT is the difference in CT between target and
reference genes.
Immunohistochemical assay. Cells (1  106) were collected and fixed
in 10% formalin for 5 min at room temperature, suspended in agarose, and
embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer tissue sections were cut from each
block and placed on positively charged microscope slides. The slides were
deparaffinized by immersing in xylene and rehydrated in serial dilutions of
100%, 95%, and 70% ethanol. After rehydration, the slides were washed
several times with deionized water at room temperature. Antigen retrieval
was done using a BioGenex Citra plus at 95jC for 15 min. The slides were
stained in an automated BioGenex i6000 immunohistochemical system.

Both EphA2 and caveolin-1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA) and were incubated with slides at 0.5 Ag/mL for 1 h at
room temperature followed by three washes in PBS. The envision kit from
DAKO (Carpinteria, CA) was used for detection. The slides were then
counterstained with hematoxylin for 5 min. As a control, a rabbit IgG was
used instead of the primary antibody for the marker being studied. All the
negative controls gave no staining (data not shown).
Western blot analysis. Cells were either untreated or treated with
0.1 Amol/L of dasatinib for 1 h. Equal amounts of protein from cell extracts
were immunoprecipitated with EPHA2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology,
Lake Placid, NY) and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following
transfer to Immobilon-P polyvinyl membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford,
MA), the blots were blocked overnight at 4jC in TBS containing 0.1% Tween
20 detergent and 5% nonfat dry milk. To detect EPHA2, membranes were
incubated in the presence of EPHA2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology).
To detect phospho-EPHA2, the same blot was stripped and probed with
0.5 Ag/mL of mouse monoclonal anti-pY20 antibody (BD Biosciences,
Lexington, KY). For visualization, chemiluminescence reagent ECL Plus
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) was used as directed by the
manufacturer.
Dasatinib treatment of breast cancer cell lines and selection of
genes modulated by the drug. Eleven breast cell lines (MDA-MB-157,
MDA-MB-231, HCC1954, HCC70, HCC1806, SK-BR-3, BT-474, MDA-MB-468,
HCC1428, ZR-75-1, and MDA-MB-453) with IC50 values ranging from
5.5 nmol/L to 9.5 Amol/L were treated with 0.4 Amol/L of dasatinib for
24 h. The expression profiling was done, and a pair-wise comparison
between drug-treated and corresponding untreated control was conducted
using GeneChip Expression Analysis software MAS 5.0. A change call of
‘‘increase’’ or ‘‘decrease’’ in gene expression level was assigned for each
probe set. This analysis was done for all 11 cell lines to compare expression
changes upon drug treatment. If a gene was consistently assigned ‘‘increase’’
or ‘‘decrease’’ in at least four cell lines, the gene was considered as
modulated by the drug treatment.
EPHA2 kinase inhibition assay. An EPHA2 kinase assay was done
using 5 to 200 ng of baculovirus-expressed, glutathione affinity–purified
EPHA2 fusion protein, 1.5 Amol/L of poly Glu/Tyr (Sigma, St. Louis, MO),
0.3 Amol/L of ATP, and 0.15 ACi [g-33P]ATP in 50 AL kinase buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum
albumin, 0.3 mmol/L MnCl2]. The reaction mixture was incubated at 28jC
for 1 h and the phosphorylated synthetic substrate was quantitated using a
TopCount 96-well liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences,
Inc., Boston, MA).

Results
The use of breast cancer cell lines to identify candidate
predictive markers. Twenty-three breast cancer cell lines were
used to identify candidate markers that may predict response to
dasatinib. The sensitivity of these cell lines to dasatinib (i.e., the
ability of dasatinib to inhibit cell growth in a proliferation assay,
quantified as an IC50 value) ranged from 5.5 nmol/L to >9.5 Amol/L
(Table 1). To classify cell lines as either sensitive or resistant to
dasatinib, the mean of the log10(IC50) across the 23 cell lines was
calculated and used as a line of demarcation. The cell lines with
log10(IC50) below the mean were defined as sensitive to the drug,
whereas those with log10(IC50) above the mean were considered to
be resistant. As shown in Fig. 1A, 7 and 16 cell lines were classified
as either sensitive or resistant to dasatinib, respectively. The
sensitive/resistant demarcation was f0.6 Amol/L (Table 1).
Although the demarcation is arbitrary, data from phase I solid
tumor clinical trials showed that 0.6 Amol/L was within the peak
range of dasatinib plasma concentrations in patients treated with
the doses near the maximum tolerated dose.
Next, the gene expression profiles for these 23 cell lines were
generated. To identify genes correlated with this dasatinib-sensitive/

resistant classification, three statistical methods were used (Fig. 1B).
By examining the overlap between the genes selected by these three
methods (Supplementary Fig. S1), we were able to identify 201 probe
sets representing 161 unique genes (28 unique genes have two or
more probe sets) that were significantly correlated with the dasatinib
sensitivity/resistance classification. As listed in Table 2, there were 83
genes highly expressed in the cell lines sensitive to dasatinib and 78
genes highly expressed in the resistant cell lines. The expression
pattern of these genes in the 23 breast cell lines is illustrated in
Fig. 1C and a clear separation of sensitive cell lines from a majority
of the resistant cell lines was observed (Fig. 1D).
In order to test the ability of the genes listed in Table 2 to
discriminate sensitivity to dasatinib in independent test samples,
all 161 genes were used to build a predictor based on their
expression patterns in the 23 breast cell lines. This predictor was
then used to predict the response to dasatinib in 12 additional
breast cancer cell lines (Table 1) by using a weighted-voting
algorithm (refs. 27, 28; Supplementary Information) implemented
in the GeneCluster 2.0 software. The observed sensitive/resistant
classification was based on the IC50 cutoff of 0.6 Amol/L. The 161gene model correctly predicted three out of four sensitive and all
eight resistant breast cancer cell lines, resulting in a sensitivity of
75% and a specificity of 100% (Table 3). A prediction accuracy of
92% (11 of 12) was achieved (P = 0.0182, Fisher exact test). The
positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 100%
and 89%, respectively.
Prioritization of the candidate predictive markers. Although
technologies now exist to examine thousands of genes simultaneously, the identification of a more limited number of markers
that predict response to dasatinib might be more useful in clinical
studies. Markers were selected based on their biological functions
in SFK-related signaling pathways. The Ingenuity Pathways
Analysis (Redwood City, CA) tool was initially used to explore the
functions and networks of the 161 markers. Gene expression
changes or protein modifications caused by inhibiting SRC activity
with dasatinib and/or reducing SRC expression with short
interfering RNA (siRNA) were further used to help identify genes
involved in SFK signaling pathways. To identify genes regulated by
dasatinib, 11 breast cancer cell lines were treated with dasatinib.
Pair-wise comparisons between cells treated with or without
dasatinib were done to identify probe sets that were modulated by
the drug treatment. Of the 161 genes which had basal levels that
were significantly correlated with sensitivity to dasatinib, 28 were

significantly modulated by dasatinib treatment (Table 2). EPHA2 is
shown as an example that the expression level was significantly
reduced in response to dasatinib in multiple sensitive breast cancer
cell lines (Fig. 2A).
Blocking SRC expression by siRNA was also used to explore
whether it has the same effect as dasatinib treatment. Western
blot analyses of SRC, EPHA2, and CAV1 was done on SRCspecific siRNA reagent–transfected cells. The results showed that
SRC expression was inhibited by an average of 47% in SRCsiRNA–transfected cells (ranging from 24% to 64% for five
SRC-siRNA reagents), and EPHA2 and CAV1 expression was
reduced by 9% to 30% and 13% to 56%, respectively (data not
shown). From both dasatinib treatment and SRC-siRNA transfection experiments, it is evident that inhibition of activity or

expression of SRC can down-regulate the expression of both
EPHA2 and CAV1.
Because EPHA2 is a tyrosine kinase and dasatinib is a tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, an obvious question is if the down-regulation of
EPHA2 expression by dasatinib is due to a direct effect of the drug
on EPHA2 or through inhibition of SRC activity. SRC-siRNA results
suggest that SRC can modulate EPHA2 expression. However, it is
still possible that dasatinib may affect EPHA2 through two
mechanisms: one via SRC inhibition, another through direct
inhibition of EPHA2. To this end, Western blot analyses was done
to evaluate total and phosphorylated EPHA2 protein levels in nine
breast tumor cell lines treated with or without dasatinib. Total
EPHA2 protein levels were not changed after 1 h of dasatinib
treatment, whereas the tyrosine phosphorylation of EPHA2 was

NOTE: Sensitive and resistant gene signatures are listed separately and ranked by S2N score. Positive or negative signs correspond to genes being more
highly expressed in sensitive class or resistant class.
*For nonannotated genes, Affymetrix probe set ID are provided as the identification.
cCorrelation between the IC50 values and the expression level of each gene in cell lines was assessed by Pearson correlation coefficient r.
bEleven breast cell lines were treated with 0.1 Amol/L of dasatinib for 24 h. Pair-wise comparisons between cells treated with or without dasatinib were
done, genes whose expressions were significantly increased or decreased in at least four cell lines were considered to be modulated by the drug
treatment.

dramatically decreased (Fig. 2B). This led us to further test whether
dasatinib can directly inhibit EPHA2 kinase activity. In vitro kinase
inhibition assays were done. The results showed that dasatinib has
an IC50 of 17 nmol/L for EPHA2, higher than for SFKs and BCRABL (0.2–3 nmol/L) as described by Lombardo et al. (18), but still
likely to be important physiologically.
Assessment of the accuracy of a six-gene model in predicting
sensitivity to dasatinib. Although markers with high statistical
significance are candidates in building a predictive model, markers

with both statistical significance and biological relevance to the
targeted pathway may be even more useful in building predictive
models. Among the genes that are correlated with sensitivity to
dasatinib and modulated upon treatment with dasatinib and/or
SRC-siRNA, six genes (EPHA2, CAV1, CAV2, ANXA1 PTRF, and
IGFBP2) were selected for further assessment. All six of these genes
are either targets of dasatinib, are substrates for SRC family
kinases, or are part of signaling pathways downstream of SRC
family kinases. First, these six genes were used to build a predictor

based on the expression results of the 23 breast cancer cell lines
that were initially used to select candidate genes. Second, the
predictive power of the six-gene predictor was tested on the test set
of 12 breast cancer cell lines. The same prediction result was
obtained using the 6-gene predictor as using the 161-gene predictor
(Table 3). Because the value of a predictor that could be used
across indications is greater than one that works in a single
indication, we tested the accuracy of both the 6-gene and the
161-gene models in another test set of 23 lung cancer cell lines
(Table 1). As shown in Table 3, the prediction accuracy for the
6-gene predictor and the 161-gene predictor was 83% (19 of 23) and
74% (17 of 23), respectively, suggesting that the 6-gene predictor
might be more useful in additional indications.
The prediction power of the six-gene predictor was further
assessed in seven tumor xenografts that were generated either from
cancer cell lines (breast, MCF-7; prostate, PC3 and MDAPCa-2b;
and colon, WiDr) or from pancreatic tumors (Pat-25, Pat-26, and
Pat-27). Xenografts Pat 26, Pat27, PC3, and WiDr were predicted to
be sensitive, whereas Pat 25, MCF-7, and MDAPCa-2b were
predicted to be resistant to dasatinib; the predicted result matched
perfectly with in vivo antitumor activity for these xenografts (data
not shown).
The expression level of these six genes was further confirmed
using qRT-PCR. The correlation between the expression values
obtained by Affymetrix microarray analysis and by qRT-PCR for
each gene in the panel of 23 breast cell lines was measured by
Pearson correlation coefficient r, which was determined to be 0.90,
0.94, 0.93, 0.82, 0.94, and 0.98 for EPHA2, CAV1, CAV2, ANXA1, PTRF,
and IGFBP2, respectively. The results indicated statistically good
correlations (P < 0.001 for all six genes) obtained by these two
analysis methods. The fold change in the average expression
values between 7 sensitive and 16 resistant cell lines detected by
both technologies showed a high correlation for these six genes
(Fig. 3A).
To determine if the protein levels for these candidate genes were
correlated with mRNA expression levels, immunohistochemical
assays were developed to evaluate the protein expression of EPHA2
and CAV1. Three breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, BT-474,
and MCF7) were selected for immunohistochemical testing and as
illustrated in Fig. 3B, the highest expression was observed in the
sensitive MDA-MB-231 cell line, whereas lower expression was
observed in the resistant cell lines BT-474 and MCF7. The
immunohistochemical results were consistent with the results
obtained from RNA expression as measured by both microarray
and qRT-PCR. Moreover, the results showed that the protein levels
of these two genes were also correlated with the sensitivity of cell
lines to dasatinib, suggesting that both RNA- and protein-based
assays may have utility in predicting response to dasatinib.
Gene signatures and predicting response to dasatinib in
multiple tumor types. To explore whether the 161-gene signature
also exists in primary breast tumors, an expression data set of 134
primary breast tumor specimens (29) was examined. Hierarchical
clustering analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2A) classified the breast
tumors into two distinct groups with one group of tumors (red
cluster) expressing the gene signature found in dasatinib-resistant
cell lines and the other group (blue cluster) expressing the gene
signature found in dasatinib-sensitive cell lines. A similar pattern
was also observed for lung (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and ovarian
tumors (data not shown). Our next goal was to estimate the
percentage of cancer patients predicted to be responsive to
dasatinib using the six-gene predictor identified by in vitro breast

cancer cell lines. Gene expression databases for breast, lung, and
ovarian cancer were interrogated. Depending on the tumor type,
30% to 40% of the patients were predicted to be responsive to
dasatinib (Table 4).
To further investigate the dasatinib-responsive subpopulation
predicted by the six-gene model in breast cancer, we examined
several well-known markers that define breast cancer subtypes.
The expression level of ER, PR, and HER2 was assessed for the
dasatinib-responsive and nonresponsive subpopulations. Most
strikingly, as shown in Table 5, there were significant differences
in the distribution of tumors expressing ER, PR and/or HER2
between the two groups (e.g., a higher percentage of the patients
predicted to be dasatinib-responsive were ER/PR/HER2-negative).
Furthermore, a higher percentage of tumors with high expression
levels of KRT5 and KRT17 were observed in the patients predicted
to be responders compared with those predicted to be nonresponders, suggesting dasatinib responding tumors may include
the basal type of breast cancer as defined by KRT5/KRT17
expression (30). This analysis was also done using the 161-gene
signatures and similar results (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D) were
observed between the dasatinib-responder (blue cluster) and
nonresponder (red cluster) groups.

Predictive Markers for Dasatinib Sensitivity

Discussion
This study focused on the identification of a molecular signature
that could be used to guide early clinical development of dasatinib
in solid tumors. We conducted preclinical pharmacogenomic studies
in a panel of cancer cell lines to identify 161 genes, the expression
levels of which were significantly correlated with the sensitivity/
resistance classification to dasatinib. The RNA and protein expression levels of selected genes were further confirmed and validated
by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical assays. Finally, predictive
models built with the 161 genes and with a smaller set of 6 genes were
independently validated on both breast and lung cancer cell lines.
Many of the 161 genes identified in this study are linked to
signaling pathways of SFKs, including genes involved in cell cycle,
cell growth and proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and migration.
The expression of LYN, a SFK member (31), is correlated with
sensitivity to dasatinib in breast cancer cell lines (Table 2), even
though SRC expression is not. Genes such as CAV1 and CAV2 that
are highly expressed in dasatinib sensitive cell lines are substrates
for SFKs and functionally involved in SFK signaling pathways (32).
Furthermore, it has been suggested that CAV1 protein is necessary
for the activation of SFKs which then induce the tyrosine
phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (33, 34). Many genes

down-regulated by dasatinib treatment are involved in functions
that SFKs have been previously implicated, suggesting an important role for dasatinib in modulating SFK signaling.
SFKs are intracellular membrane-associated tyrosine kinases
that are required for mitogenesis initiated by multiple growth
factor receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth
factor receptor (Met), fibroblast growth factor receptor, and
colony-stimulating factor receptor through growth factor ligand
binding (35). It has been reported that in highly metastatic human
colon cancer cell lines, both MET and EGFR activate SRC (36).
In some human breast cancers there is evidence that synergism
between SFKs and EGFR or Met may contribute to tumor growth
(37). Our results show that expression of several receptor tyrosine
kinase (e.g., EPHA2, EPHB2, EGFR and MET) are correlated with
sensitivity to dasatinib, suggesting that combination treatment of
dasatinib with inhibitors of EGFR and/or MET may represent an
attractive approach for treatment of patients with tumors
expressing these kinases. EPHA2 and EPHB2 are members of the
largest family of tyrosine kinase receptors. EPHA2, is highly
expressed in many human cancers and often associated with poor
prognostic features and it is involved in many processes crucial to

malignant progression, such as migration, invasion, metastasis,
proliferation, survival and angiogenesis (38). Our results show
that EPHA2 is highly expressed in dasatinib sensitive cell lines and
its expression, phosphorylation and kinase activity are reduced
upon dasatinib treatment, indicating that EPHA2 is one of the
downstream targets for dasatinib.
Although SRC expression is not correlated with the sensitivity of
breast cancer cell lines to dasatinib, the activation status of the SRC
pathway may be. A recent report identified a gene expression
signature that reflects the activation status of the SRC oncogenic
pathway, and the signature can predict the sensitivity of a broad
range of human tumor cell lines to a SRC inhibitor, SU6656 (39).
When we use the SRC pathway signature to perform clustering
analysis on the 23 breast cell lines, an expression pattern similar to
the one shown in Fig. 1D was observed (Supplementary Fig. S3)
with dasatinib sensitive cell lines separated from resistant ones,
further confirming the finding that cancer cell lines with an
activated oncogenic pathway can be correlated with sensitivity to
therapeutic agents that target components of that pathway. The
results show that different analytic approaches to identify markers
of sensitivity to agents targeting specific oncogene may identify the
same subset of cell lines and, ultimately, patients that will benefit
from such agents.
The selection of 6 genes from the initial set of 161 genes to build
a predictive model was based on their biological functions in SRC
family kinase-related signaling pathways and availability for assay
development. This selection is empirical and alternative predictors
consisting of different combinations of genes from the 161 genes

may be equally predictive as the 6-gene model identified herein. As
recently discussed by Fan et al. (40) although different gene sets are
being used for prognostication in patients with breast cancer, they
each track a common set of biological characteristics and result in
similar predictions of outcome. The observation that the 161-gene
signature and the SRC pathway signature (39) identify a similar set
of breast cell lines as either sensitive or resistant to SFK inhibitors
such as dasatinib supports the observation by Fan et al. (Fig. 1D;
Supplementary Fig. S3).
Interestingly, a simultaneous and independent study by Finn
et al. using a different array platform (Agilent), different cell lines,
and different assays for proliferation identified three genes CAV1,
MSN and YAP1 to be highly expressed in dasatinib sensitive breast
cell lines and predictive of dasatinib sensitivity (25). Both CAV1 and
MSN were identified in our study, and YAP1 just missed our
stringent statistical cutoff (t test P = 0.025 in our study).
A number of genes in Table 2 were reported to be associated with
sensitivity or resistance to other anticancer agents. A study of the
molecular markers associated with four anticancer platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin, tetraplatin and oxaliplatin) in cancer
cell lines indicated that the expression level of CAV2 and F3 are
correlated with sensitivity to both tetraplatin and oxaliplatin,
whereas CAV1, TGFBR2 and CALD1 only correlated with sensitivity
to oxaliplatin (41). Another gene, MYO10 is elevated in both oxaliplatin and carboplatin chemosensitive cells (41, 42). All these
genes are also expressed at higher levels in dasatinib sensitive cell
lines (Table 2). On the other hand, genes that had expressions which
were elevated in dasatinib-resistant cell lines included IGFBP2,
IRX5, and MAPT, each of which have been reported to be associated with chemoresistance to the platinum drug AMD473 (43), to
5-fluorouracil (44), and to paclitaxel (45), respectively. EMP2 is another resistant marker for dasatinib, whereas EMP1 was identified
as both a de novo and acquired marker of gefitinib resistance (46).
Multidrug resistance of tumors is frequently associated with
decreased cellular accumulation of anticancer drugs and elevated
expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Although,
dasatinib is not a substrate of MDR1, other ABC transporter genes
such as ABCA3 and ABCG1 were highly expressed in dasatinib
resistant cell lines, suggesting they may contribute to the resistance
mechanism of dasatinib. Additional experiments will be needed to
address the role of each marker that contributes to the complex
phenotype associated with drug sensitivity and resistance.

Predictive Markers for Dasatinib Sensitivity

The results in this study clearly showed that the six-gene
predictor identified from the 23 breast cell lines can be used to
predict the sensitivity to dasatinib not only in breast but also in
lung cancer cell lines (prediction accuracy of 92% and 83%,
respectively, in independent test sets). We have used the six-gene
predictor to identify 30% to 40% of primary breast, lung and
ovarian cancer patients for whom dasatinib might be beneficial.
For breast tumors, the expression status of ER, PR and HER2 was
examined and found to correlate with dasatinib sensitivity,
allowing us to recognize a patient subpopulation that can be
identified using diagnostics currently available to oncologists. The
predicted dasatinib-responsive subgroup tends to have more
tumors with lower expression of ER, PR , or HER2 gene and more
tumors with higher expression of KRT5/KRT17 (Table 5; Supplementary Fig. S2C and D). An independent study supported our
observations by showing that the majority of dasatinib-sensitive
breast cancer cell lines were ‘‘basal’’ type or ‘‘triple-negative’’ (25).
This patient population is one that currently does not benefit from
conventional targeted therapies such as endocrine therapy or
trastuzumab, leaving only chemotherapy in the therapeutic
armamentarium. Considering that these patients express a
dasatinib-sensitive gene signature, this drug may represent a
valuable treatment option in this difficult-to-treat population of
patients with breast cancer and clinical studies are now under way
to determine the activity of dasatinib in these patients.

The clinical utility of such a predictor will now be tested in
clinical studies. It should be noted that dasatinib is, in vitro, a
cytostatic agent that is more likely to have an effect on disease
control than to cause tumor regressions. Furthermore, our efforts
have focused on identifying markers that will predict those tumors
for which dasatinib will have an antiproliferative effect. It is
possible that dasatinib will also show benefit in cancer patients
that do not have the predictive signature identified in this study for
two reasons. First, because SRC plays an important role downstream of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling (47, 48), it
is likely that dasatinib will also have antiangiogenic effects. Second,
because SRC plays an important role in osteoclast function (49), it
is possible that dasatinib will benefit patients with bone
metastases. The role of dasatinib as an antiangiogenic and
anti–bone metastases agent will be explored in separate clinical
studies.
