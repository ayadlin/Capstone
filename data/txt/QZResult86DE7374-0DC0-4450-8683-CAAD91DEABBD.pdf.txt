BACKGROUND: In the AFFIRM trial, enzalutamide significantly increased overall survival (OS) for men with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after chemotherapy versus placebo and significantly decreased prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
levels. The goal of this post hoc analysis was to associate levels of PSA decline from baseline after enzalutamide with clinical outcomes in the postchemotherapy mCRPC setting. METHODS: Men in the AFFIRM trial (n 5 1199) were grouped by maximal PSA decline in the first 90 days of treatment. Kaplan-Meier estimates evaluated the association of defined PSA changes from baseline with
OS, progression-free survival (PFS), radiographic PFS (rPFS), and pain response. Each PSA decline category was assessed for OS surrogacy using Prentice criteria, proportion of treatment effect explained (PTE), and proportion of variation explained. RESULTS: Men
treated with enzalutamide had improved OS (hazard ratio, 0.63; P < .001) and higher rates of PSA decline (odds ratio, >19.0; P <
.001) versus placebo. PSA declines of any, 30%, 50%, and 90% with enzalutamide were strongly associated with greater OS, PSA
PFS, rPFS (P < .001), and pain response (P < .026) versus PSA increase/no decline. Any, 30%, and 50% declines in PSA resulted in
the PTE range of 1.07-1.29, where treatment was no longer significant after adjustment for decline measures (P > .20). CONCLUSIONS: PSA declines of any, 30%, and 50% following enzalutamide were associated with greater clinical and pain response and improvements in PFS and OS. Surrogacy of PSA decline for OS was not fully established, possibly due to lack of PSA declines with
placebo, and discordant results between PSA and imaging responses over time, and because some declines were not durable due to
rapid resistance development. However, a lack of PSA decline by 90 days following enzalutamide treatment was a poor prognosis indicator in this setting. Conclusions from sensitivity analyses of maximal PSA decline from baseline over the entire treatment period

INTRODUCTION
Metastatic prostate cancer remains highly lethal worldwide1 despite recent therapeutic advances, including docetaxel, cabazitaxel,
sipuleucel-T, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and radium-223.2-8 Survival times for men with metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer (mCRPC) vary depending on known prognostic risk factors.9-11 Clinical trials involving metastatic prostate cancer may be confounded by posttreatment options that impact mortality, limiting the ability to discern survival benefits.
Intermediate endpoints, including serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes, may help determine therapeutic
efficacy and prognostic effect due to therapeutic responses, facilitate therapeutic agent selection in phase 1 and 2 clinical
trials, and aid decision-making for treatment continuation. PSA is directly regulated by androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity12 and is therefore a pharmacodynamic biomarker that reports on-target activity of AR-directed

therapies.2,4,6-8,13-15 PSA level changes may be associated
with tumor burden changes over time and improvements
in survival, although PSA “flares” can be observed.11,16,17
Posttherapy PSA declines have been explored as potential surrogates for overall survival (OS) in men with
mCRPC. In 2 randomized phase 3 trials for docetaxel and
prednisone treatment, associations of PSA decline of
30% and 50% were found with OS.11,17 Additionally,
a randomized phase 3 trial of cabazitaxel and prednisone
treatment found an association for PSA decline of 30%
and OS.18 However, surrogacy of these PSA declines was
not established. Although the current recommendations for
clinical trials conducted in men with CRPC include descriptive reporting of PSA declines, such declines are not accepted as endpoints for registration.19 Importantly, the
agents used in these trials were cytotoxic and did not affect
AR transcription directly, unlike novel androgen signalingdirected therapies such as enzalutamide.11,17
Enzalutamide targets AR, an oncogenic receptor
known to contribute to castration-resistant prostate cancer
progression.20 In the phase 3 randomized AFFIRM trial,
enzalutamide treatment significantly prolonged life and
resulted in higher frequency of PSA declines versus placebo
in men with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel.7
We explored PSA declines as prognostic indicators of OS,
progression-free survival (PFS), and pain response and for
surrogate associations with improved OS for enzalutamide.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Conduct

The AFFIRM trial (NCT00974311) was a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial assessing
the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in men with
mCRPC. Full trial protocol details have been described
previously.7 Briefly, eligible men had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer, castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dL), previous treatment with
docetaxel, and progressive disease according to Prostate
Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG) 2 criteria.19 Men were randomized 2:1 to receive 160 mg/d of
oral enzalutamide (n 5 800) or placebo (n 5 399).
Analysis of PSA Decline

Serum PSA was measured before randomized treatment initiation at baseline and at or after the 12 week visit (90
days) to preserve the study blind until disease progression,
concurrent with restaging scans with computed tomography
and bone scan reassessments. Earlier values were not
obtained to maintain study blinding. Additional PSA measurements were conducted at 17 and 21 weeks after treat2304

ment initiation. In this post hoc analysis, participants were
grouped by maximal unconfirmed PSA decline during the
first 90 days of enzalutamide treatment (Supporting Fig. 1).
Surrogacy Evaluation

Statistical surrogacy was evaluated for each percentage category of unconfirmed posttreatment PSA decline from
baseline, achievement of posttreatment PSA levels of
0.2 ng/mL from baseline during the first 90 days of
enzalutamide treatment, and confirmed PSA declines that
may have incorporated values beyond 90 days. Surrogacy
was described using Prentice criteria, proportion of treatment effect explained (PTE), and proportion of variation
explained (PVE).
The Prentice criteria require 4 statistical analy11,21
ses
: 1) whether treatment has a significant effect on
survival; 2) whether treatment has a significant effect on
PSA decline; 3) whether PSA decline has a significant impact on survival; and 4) whether PSA decline captures the
full effect of treatment on survival. Cox models assessed
Prentice criteria 1, 3, and 4 according to statistical tests,
and logistic regression assessed criterion 2.
PTE, the percentage change of treatment effects estimated from 2 Cox models with or without adjusting for
the surrogate,11,22 was assessed using the point estimate
discussed by Lin et al22; its confidence interval (CI) estimate can extend beyond the 0-1 range.23 PTE is an approximation of the proportion of net effect on outcome
explained by the effect of the surrogate. Ranges near 0 indicate lack of surrogacy, and ranges of or near 1 indicate
evidence consistent with surrogacy. According to the
Prentice criteria, a valid surrogate marker must capture all
treatment effects on the endpoint (ie, survival).24 PTE values >1 are theoretically at variance with Prentice’s most
restrictive criterion; they could reflect a lack of surrogacy
and be biologically explained by either treatment-related
toxicities independent of the surrogate effect or confounded by more aggressive disease in those patients who had
not experienced PSA decline after treatment with enzalutamide, resulting in a negative treatment effect after
adjusting for the surrogate in the Cox model. Because the
95% CI for PTE may contain ranges of values 1, evidence of surrogacy was evaluated by examining the lower
bound of the 95% CI, where PTE values less than the lower bound can be excluded with 2.5% confidence.
PVE (R2) estimates the degree of variation in survival explained by the predictor of survival in the Cox model.
PVE ranges from 0 to 1; adding treatment to the surrogate
Cox model should not significantly increase PVE under
conditions of surrogacy.11,25

Association of PSA Decline With Clinical
Outcome and Pain Response

Statistical analyses used to assess associations between OS,
PFS, and pain response and different posttreatment PSA
declines from baseline during the first 90 days of enzalutamide treatment are described in the Supporting
Information.
RESULTS
Prognostic Association of PSA Decline With
Clinical Outcomes

In the AFFIRM trial, the median baseline PSA was
108 ng/mL (range, 0.2-11,794.1 ng/mL) for men treated
with enzalutamide (n 5 800) and 128 ng/mL (range 019,000 ng/mL) for men receiving placebo (n 5 399).
Enzalutamide treatment significantly increased survival
for men with mCRPC versus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.63;
95% CI, 0.53-0.75; P < .001),7 fulfilling Prentice criterion 1, and was strongly associated with each PSA decline
(Prentice criterion 2) versus placebo (odds ratio, >19.0;
P < .001). The odds ratio for PSA 0.2 ng/mL was not
calculable.
The proportion of men randomized to enzalutamide
with confirmed PSA declines by 3 months of therapy
depended on the magnitude of the PSA decline and
Cancer

June 15, 2017

ranged from 40% (any PSA decline within 90 days) to
1.3% (achievement of a posttreatment 0.2), as shown in
Supporting Table 1. The proportion of men who achieved
any confirmed PSA decline was 1.0% (n 5 4) within the
first 90 days of receiving placebo, and higher levels of PSA
decline with placebo were not observed. The proportion
of men with PSA increase/no decline was 43.6% for enzalutamide and 73.2% for placebo. Similar results were observed for the proportion of men with unconfirmed levels
of PSA decline and using PSA declines from a broader
time frame, including all PSA values on study (data not
shown). Documented PSA increase/no decline by 90 days
on enzalutamide treatment was rarely followed by subsequent falls in PSA levels at later points (PSA flare phenomenon; n 5 11, 1.4%). These data demonstrate that
PSA declines are strongly associated with enzalutamide
treatment.
Men were next grouped by maximal confirmed PSA
decline within the first 90 days of enzalutamide treatment
to examine the prognostic association of PSA decline with
clinical outcomes (Prentice criterion 3). Compared with
an increase/no decline in PSA levels, declines of any,
30%, 50%, and 90% within the first 90 days of
enzalutamide treatment were associated with longer OS
(Table 1; Fig. 1), PSA PFS (Table 1; Fig. 2), and rPFS

ranged from 36.0% to 100% (Table 1). Analyses for unconfirmed PSA thresholds yielded similar results (Table
1). In men treated with enzalutamide, those with confirmed PSA declines of 30% had consistently greater
OS versus men with PSA decline of <30% (Fig. 4).
The median duration of PSA PFS for men with PSA
increase/no decline and confirmed PSA declines of 30%
and 50% was 4.6 months (95% CI, 4.6-4.6),
11.1 months (95% CI, 11.0-13.8), and 11.1 months
(95% CI, 11.1-14.0), respectively (Table 1). The median
duration of PSA PFS and rPFS had not been reached for
men with confirmed PSA declines of 90% and 0.2 ng/
mL (Table 1). The median rPFS duration for men with
PSA increase/no decline and confirmed PSA decline of
30% and 50% were 5.5 months (95% CI, 5.3-5.6),
16.1 months (95% CI, 13.8-16.6), and 16.5 months
(95% CI, 13.8-18.1), respectively (Table 1; Fig. 3). Analyses of unconfirmed PSA thresholds yielded similar results
(Table 1).
Confirmed PSA declines of 30%, 50%, and
90% within 90 days of enzalutamide treatment were associated with a greater proportion of men with pain response (52.3%, 50.9%, and 63.2%, respectively)
compared with increase/no decline in PSA levels (32.0%;
P < .026 for all; Table 1). Similar trends were observed in

of enzalutamide treatment for all unconfirmed PSA
thresholds (Table 1).
PSA Declines as Surrogates for OS

Because PSA decline was strongly associated with posttreatment outcomes, we quantified the surrogate associations for OS. Prentice criteria 1-3 were met for any PSA
decline and declines of 30%, 50%, and 90% (Supporting Table 2). For Prentice criterion 4, we examined
the impact of treatment on OS after adjustment for each
surrogate PSA decline level. For any, 30%, and 50%
PSA declines, the introduction of this surrogate into a
model of treatment effect on OS demonstrated that treatment effect lost statistical significance (Supporting Table
2), fulfilling a necessary but insufficient element for Prentice criterion 4. The other evaluated levels of PSA declines
did not fulfill surrogacy, despite strong associations
with outcomes. Patterns of increase observed with the
PVE criterion (R2) were consistent with surrogacy for
PSA declines of 30%, 50%, and 90% (Supporting
Table 2). PSA response levels exhibited considerably
stronger correlations with survival than treatment; the addition of treatment to the model with PSA response did
not effectively change R2.

enzalutamide treatment resulted in point estimates for
PTE from 0.90 (95% CI, 0.55-1.26) to 1.29 (95% CI,
0.73-1.85; Supporting Table 1). These thresholds also
resulted in treatment effect no longer remaining significant after adjustment for decline measures (P  .20; hazard ratio range, 0.96-1.14). We next examined the lower
bounds of the 95% CI for PTE to ascertain which surrogate seemed more strongly associated with OS. Based on
analyses of PTE, confirmed PSA declines of any and
30% had 95% CI lower bounds of PTE modestly
higher than those of PSA declines of 50% (0.76 and
0.66 versus 0.55, respectively; Supporting Table 1). Levels
of unconfirmed PSA declines yielded similar results (Supporting Table 1), as did analyses using posttreatment PSA
values beyond the 90-day period (data not shown).
PSA Confirmation and Evaluation of
Concordance With Radiographic Progression

Finally, we asked whether discordant results on radiographic imaging were observed in men who achieved PSA
decline. No patients were identified with radiographic
progression before or at 90 days of enzalutamide treatment, partly due to the timing of the scheduled radiographic evaluations, which only required assessment to
confirm progression in case of worsening disease. Among
the 141 men with a confirmed PSA increase as their best
response on enzalutamide at day 90, 4.3% went on to
have a complete or partial response according to RECIST
criteria. Among the men with confirmed PSA declines,
2308

however, 40%, 35%, 34%, and 16% had radiographic
progression before confirmation (typically at 6-month
posttreatment initiation) of any, 30%, 50%, and
90% PSA declines, respectively.
DISCUSSION
In the AFFIRM trial, enzalutamide significantly increased
OS for men with mCRPC treated with chemotherapy versus placebo and was strongly associated with PSA declines
(Prentice criterion 1).7 In this post hoc analysis, PSA
declines from baseline within the first 90 days of enzalutamide treatment were associated with improved clinical
and pain response, indicating a strong clinical association
of PSA decline with outcomes. Our results, extending
analyses to all posttreatment PSA values, were similar to
those observed using the best PSA decline within 90 days
of treatment; these results suggest that although posttherapy PSA changes provide significant prognostic information for mCRPC patients, they are not always a surrogate
for survival and must be interpreted with caution. These
results should facilitate patient–physician decision-making that considers the net clinical benefit of continuing
therapy over time, based on patient symptoms, imaging,
and biomarkers such as PSA changes. In addition, absence
of PSA decline at 90 days after enzalutamide treatment
was a marker of poor prognosis and OS at approximately
1 year. These data suggest that PSA monitoring during
treatment with enzalutamide provides useful prognostic
information during enzalutamide therapy.

PSA Decline Outcomes After Enzalutamide/Armstrong et al

Rapid radiographic progression within 3 months
was observed in some men with mCRPC who experienced
a PSA decline, indicating intrinsic or rapidly acquired resistance and illustrating the importance of computed tomography and bone scan surveillance over time, and
highlighting the need for additional therapies to improve
PFS and OS in these men. Furthermore, 4%-5% of men
with an early PSA increase on enzalutamide at day 90 will
go on to develop radiographic responses, illustrating a disconnection between early PSA changes and clinical benefit in individual patients with mCRPC. Whereas early
PSA changes are strongly associated with prognosis across
all men with mCRPC, at an individual level such PSA
changes can be either transient or not reflective of the
overall benefit of enzalutamide treatment and suggest the
ongoing need for additional assessments. We recommend
that PSA changes alone should not be used clinically in
the management of patients with mCRPC treated with
enzalutamide, despite the prognostic information the
changes provide.
The results from the AFFIRM trial are, in part, consistent with previous clinical trials in men with mCRPC
that demonstrated that PSA declines within 3 months of
treatment were associated with improved OS but did not
fulfill all surrogacy criteria.11,17,18 These results are also
consistent with recent post hoc analyses of clinical trial
data in which PSA declines of 30% and 50% from
baseline at day 28 after treatment with enzalutamide, abiraterone acetate, or orteronel were shown to be significantly
associated with improved OS in patients with mCRPC.26
Full surrogacy was not demonstrated in the present study,
possibly due to the rarity of PSA declines with placebo
treatment and due to discordant results observed in some
men between PSA declines and radiographic changes and
the development of rapid clinical or radiographic progression in others, despite an early PSA decline.
Few PSA declines were observed with placebo, demonstrating that PSA declines are strongly associated with
enzalutamide use and with long-term clinical outcomes.
Despite this, the discordance between PSA changes and
radiographic progression or response suggests that surrogacy would not be fulfilled even with an active comparator, given that radiographic progression is associated with
shortened survival in this setting.27 However, PSA
declines from baseline within 90 days of treatment
explained a substantial amount of the effect of enzalutamide on survival; treatment effect of enzalutamide on survival was lost after adjustment for these PSA decline
thresholds. Despite satisfying most criteria for surrogacy,
the occasional disconnect between PSA and radiographic

changes and the short-term nature of such PSA changes in
some men illustrates the need for careful documentation
and assessment of multiple disease phenotypic manifestations to determine whether a patient with mCRPC is still
clinically benefitting from therapy, as detailed in the
PCWG3.28
These results affirm the PCWG2 and PCWG3 recommendation to monitor changes in each manifestation
of disease separately and report changes in PSA, imaging,
and other manifestations of disease progression, as PSA
alone may not capture the full biology and resistance phenotype in patients with progressive disease.28 We emphasize the importance of not using PSA changes alone in
clinical decision-making or the phase 3 clinical trial endpoint design for treatment of men with mCRPC, and the
importance of using patient-reported symptoms, radiographic changes, and changes in other known prognostic
biomarkers to determine whether patients benefit from
systemic therapies. Although early PSA decline at these 3
posttreatment thresholds captured a proportion of the
survival benefit associated with enzalutamide treatment in
AFFIRM, isolated PSA changes should be considered in
the context of patients’ quality of life, overall burden of
disease, treatment tolerability, and alternative therapies/
goals of care. Additionally, PSA changes alone may not reflect clinical benefit with all systemic therapies. These recommendations are included in the recently updated
PCWG3 guidelines.28 However, for AR-directed therapies in phase 2 trials, PSA decline is an important pharmacodynamic biomarker indicating the on-target effect of
drugs of this class, and elevations and indication of a lack
of activity represent a need for a change in therapy. PSA
decline should be a reportable outcome to help assess clinical and biological activity of these agents over time in
men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
Another noteworthy finding of the present analysis
was the rarity of late PSA declines following initial PSA
increases at 3 months (PSA flare) with enzalutamide treatment. This was observed in 1.4% of men, suggesting that
PSA values at 3 months provide important prognosis information to communicate to patients. Earlier PSA
changes (before 12 weeks) may be present, but they were
not measured in this study per protocol. It remains unknown whether short-term transient rises in PSA with
enzalutamide treatment may occur. Confirmatory PSA
declines after 12 weeks were less common but were more
strongly associated with favorable prognosis than unconfirmed declines. Although we did not observe discordant
radiographic progression in men with unconfirmed PSA
decline at this early 3-month time point when using

PCWG2 and PCWG3 radiographic progression criteria,
rapid radiographic progression may still occur in men
who achieve PSA decline before confirmation of this decline is achieved. In addition, we found that a lack of PSA
decline at 3 months is helpful in determining who may
benefit from research strategies examining additional or
alternative approaches. Recent data suggest that whereas
rPFS is also associated with OS in men with mCRPC,27
surrogacy has not been established for this endpoint and
thus, an early PSA response determination may be useful
in clinical trial eligibility of men with poor prognosis with
mCRPC treated with enzalutamide.
Men who had PSA rises or insufficient decline
(<30%) had a less favorable clinical outcome when
treated with enzalutamide versus placebo, indicating a
subset of men with either less AR-driven castration-resistant prostate cancer, tumors with disrupted genomic
regions around the PSA locus, or with AR-variant driven
castration-resistant prostate cancer, where PSA may not
reflect AR activity in all cases. Men with mCRPC who do
not respond well to enzalutamide treatment may also harbor more aggressive or heterogeneous cancers that would
generally respond poorly to multiple types of systemic
therapy. These men may be responsible for the point estimates of PTE >1, in which early enzalutamide treatment
permits the identification of this poor prognosis group of
patients. Although it is possible that enzalutamide treatment leads to a worse outcome in these patients compared
with placebo, it is more likely that enzalutamide treatment
leads to the identification of this poor prognosis group.
In conclusion, PSA declines of any, 30%, and
50% within 90 days of enzalutamide treatment were
shown to be strongly associated with the clinical benefit of
enzalutamide treatment in men with mCRPC who had
previously received docetaxel. Given that PSA declines of
>0%, 30%, 50%, and higher are strongly associated
with clinical benefit after enzalutamide treatment, the absence of such PSA declines may assist in optimizing clinical outcomes by identifying men with mCRPC who
develop early resistance to AR-directed therapy.
