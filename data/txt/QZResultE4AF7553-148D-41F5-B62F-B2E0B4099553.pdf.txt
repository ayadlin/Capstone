BACKGROUND: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer,
the combination weekly docetaxel and carboplatin was associated a with progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.7
months compared with 8.4 months for sequential, single-agent docetaxel followed by carboplatin. The objective of
the current study was to construct a cost-utility model to compare these 2 regimens with the incorporation of prospectively collected quality-of-life (QoL) data. METHODS: An RCT of concurrent docetaxel and carboplatin (cDC) versus docetaxel followed by carboplatin (sequential docetaxel and carboplatin [sDC]) was the basis for a Markov
decision model, and the primary effectiveness outcome was PFS. Costs were estimated using US dollars based on
Medicare reimbursements for chemotherapy regimens, bone marrow support, and management of adverse events.
QoL data obtained using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General questionnaire were converted to utilities. Costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported in US dollars per quality-adjusted life
year (QALY). Extensive 1-way sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed.
RESULTS: The least expensive strategy was sDC, which cost an average of $20,381, compared with cDC, which cost
an average of $25,122. cDC had an ICER of $25,239 per QALY compared with sDC. cDC remained cost-effective, with
an ICER <$50,000 per QALY, over a range of costs and estimates. In Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis using a
$50,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, cDC was either dominant or cost-effective with an ICER <$50,000
per QALY in 83% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Combined weekly cDC appeared to be cost-effective compared
with sDC as treatment strategy for patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, even when accounting for slightly

The standard treatment for recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer is combination chemotherapy using platinum
doublets, which have demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) and, in some patients, superior overall survival (OS) compared with single-agent carboplatin.1-3 Although platinum-based combinations have yielded improved
clinical outcomes compared with single-agent carboplatin, they also have been associated with greater toxicity. This led to
a recently completed investigation of planned sequential monotherapy for platinum-sensitive recurrence with the intent of
achieving similar outcomes while introducing less toxicity than combination therapy.4
In a recently reported, randomized phase 2 trial, we studied combination carboplatin/docetaxel (cDC) and sequential docetaxel followed by carboplatin (sDC). We observed that cDC resulted in higher PFS at the expense of lower quality
of life (QoL) during treatment.4 To better quantify the tradeoff between PFS and QoL in the platinum-sensitive population, we performed a cost-utility analysis, which was informed by our randomized trial of cDC versus sDC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A cost-utility analysis was performed using a Markov state
transition model, which was constructed using TreeAge
Pro software (TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown,
Mass). Two chemotherapy regimens were compared in a
decision tree format for the treatment of recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (Fig. 1): 1) cDC with docetaxel at a dose of 30 mg/m2 given intravenously on Days 1
and 8 combined with carboplatin at an area under the
curve (AUC) of 6 mg/mL per minute intravenously on
Day 1 every 3 weeks; or 2) sDC, with docetaxel at a dose
of 30 mg/m2 given intravenously on Days 1 and 8 every 3
weeks followed by carboplatin at an AUC of 6 intravenously every 3 weeks at first progression or after 6 cycles
of docetaxel for stable disease or a partial response. These
2 chemotherapy regimens were evaluated as described separately in a prospective, phase 2 randomized controlled
trial with regard to PFS and QoL4; costs were not collected during the clinical trial but were obtained as
described below using national reimbursement data.5
Investigators were required to obtain approval from their
respective institutional review boards; the trial was registered in the clinical trials database of the United States
National Institutes of Health (National Clinical Trials no.
00090610). The time horizon for the cost-utility analysis
was 24 months, and costs and outcomes were not discounted because of the relatively short time horizon. A
third-party payer perspective was used for this analysis.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty in assumptions.

Baseline Model and Estimates
Survival

PFS was modeled for the 2 treatment strategies as
reported by Alvarez Secord et al.4 Briefly, the median PFS
was 13.7 months in the cDC arm and 8.4 months in the
sDC arm (hazard ratio for sDC, 1.62; 95% confidence
interval, 1.08-2.45). Survival was modeled by using raw
PFS data from the trial and was based on measurable disease only (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tuomors6). One Markov cycle of the model was
made equivalent to 1 chemotherapy cycle (21 days). The
time horizon of the model was set at 24 months, at which
time >95% of patients had experienced recurrence or had
died in each arm. Discounting was not performed because
of the short time horizon.
Toxicity

Rates of adverse events for which a significant difference was documented between treatment arms were modeled, and costs were applied. Specifically, the rate of
significant (Common Toxicity Criteria grade 2-3) neurotoxicity, the use of erythropoietin, and the use of granulocyte–colony-stimulating factors differed between arms
and were included in the model (Table 1). Adverse events
that were not different between the arms were not
included in the model.
Costs

Costs associated with treatment and adverse events
are listed in Table 2. The cost of one 21-day cycle of

All estimates were derived from Alvarez Secord A, Berchuck A, Higgins R,

treatment included the cost of 1 physician visit, costs of all
chemotherapy drugs administered during the cycle, all
infusion/treatment charges, and costs of standard pretreatment medications. Routine laboratory work was
excluded, because we assumed that this was similar
between regimens. The costs of each treatment modality
were estimated using national 2010 Medicare reimbursement data (www.cms.gov; accessed July 1, 2010). Costs
were applied to the treatment of adverse events whose
rates differed significantly between treatment groups in
the randomized trial (grade 3-4 neutropenia, grade 2-3
neurotoxicity). For hematologic toxicities, only the costs
of administering granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor
(pegfilgrastim; 6 mg every 3 weeks) or erythropoietin
(500 lg every 3 weeks) to the percentage of women who
received them were incorporated. Because the number of
cycles over which bone marrow support factors were
administered was not collected in the trial, we assumed
that anyone who received growth factors incurred the
costs of this treatment over 3 cycles of chemotherapy. The
cost of grade 3 and 4 neurologic toxicity was estimated as
the cost of an outpatient neurology consultation visit plus
the cost of pregabalin at 100 mg 3 times daily for 6
months ($680.28; http://www.drugstore.com; accessed
July 1, 2010); the costs of medication were estimated as
60% of charges. With regard to the additional costs of
cancer recurrence, a simplifying assumption was made.

Cost-Effectiveness of cDC in Ovarian CA/Havrilesky et al

We assumed that patients who progressed, experienced
disease recurrence, or died (events on the PFS curve)
incurred the cost of 3 additional cycles of outpatient
chemotherapy. We obtained the costs of 4 commonly
used regimens for recurrent ovarian cancer (liposomal
doxorubicin, weekly paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and weekly
topotecan) and used the mean cost of treatment with 3
cycles of these regimens as the ‘‘cost of next chemotherapy,’’ with variation over the entire range examined for
sensitivity analysis. All costs were inflated to 2010 dollars
using the medical care component of the Consumer Price
Index (http://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/cpi_nr.htm;
accessed July 1, 2010).
QoL

In the randomized trial, QoL measures were
obtained using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy (FACT) scale.7 To convert patient-reported
QoL measures to utilities for quality adjustment of trial
results, we used a previously described and validated
method that incorporates 4 items from the FACT-general
version (FACT-G) into a formula to calculate a utility.8
Therefore, a utility was calculated for each patient at 4
time points: at study entry, before Cycle 4, before Cycle 6,
and at the end of the study (Table 1). Utilities were
applied at study entry and were maintained at that value
until the next cycle, when a new utility was available. The
end-of-study time differed for each patient, and we
assumed that the end-of-study utility occurred at Cycle 12
of treatment. We also assumed that any differences in utilities eventually became insignificant, so that the entered
utility was calculated as the average of the end-of-study
utilities calculated for each treatment arm after 16 cycles.
One-Way Sensitivity Analysis
Toxicity

We performed 1-way sensitivity analyses on adverse
event rates by varying these rates over clinically reasonable
ranges (Table 1). We varied the percentage of patients
whose neurologic toxicity was severe enough to warrant a
neurology physician consultation plus use of a commonly
used medication for neuropathic pain (pregabalin). We
did not examine inpatient treatment, because no patients
in the trial developed grade 4 neuropathy.
Costs

We varied cost estimates over a wide range (from
50% to 150% of the value used in the base case) to reflect
possible variation in reimbursement rates (Table 2).

Cancer

QoL

The 95% confidence intervals were calculated
around each utility using raw QoL data and the number
of QoL responses available at each time point (Table 1).
Utility values were varied over their 95% confidence intervals at each time point sampled for Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
Sensitivity Analysis: Monte Carlo Simulation
To simultaneously account for uncertainty in all estimates, including survival, cost, adverse event rates, bone
marrow support rates, and QoL, we performed a Monte
Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 repetitions. During each repetition, sampling was performed
from distributions that represented each estimate used to
construct the model. Triangular distributions were used
for cost, whereas beta distributions were used for probabilities and survival data.

RESULTS
Base Case
In the base case, the least expensive strategy was sDC,
which had an average cost of $20,381, compared with
cDC, which had an average cost of $25,122. cDC had an
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $25,239
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared with
sDC.
One-Way Sensitivity Analyses
Cost

The costs of chemotherapy, bone marrow supportive treatment, and neurotoxicity were varied over the
ranges listed in Table 2. When the cost of cDC varies to
150% of the estimate, the ICER for this regimen becomes
$61,759 per QALY compared with sDC. When the cost
of sDC is varied to 50% of the estimate, cDC remains
cost-effective with an ICER of $49,384 per QALY. At the
high-end estimate of the cost of sDC (150%), cDC is
extremely cost-effective with an ICER of $1093 per
QALY compared with sDC. Variation in the cost of single-agent carboplatin over its range does not change the
ICER of cDC significantly ($22,062 to $28,415 per
QALY). Likewise, variation in the cost of additional
chemotherapy regimens over its range results in an ICER
between $25,000 and $26,000 per QALY (Table 3).

Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed with 10,000 repetitions, and the results are
depicted as a cost-effectiveness scatter plot in Figure 2. In
the Monte Carlo simulation, cDC was the dominant
strategy (more effective and less costly) in 11% of simulations, it was costlier but more effective with an ICER
<$50,000 per QALY in 72% of simulations, costlier but
more effective with an ICER >$50,000 per QALY in
16% of simulations, and dominated (more costly but less
effective) in 1% of simulations. The median ICER in the
Monte Carlo simulation was $21,233 per QALY (95%
confidence interval, from cDC dominant to $135,105 per
QALY).

DISCUSSION
Decisions regarding the treatment of recurrent cancer are
guided optimally by consideration of the expected additional PFS afforded by a treatment as well as by considera-

390

tion of the adverse effects of each treatment, its impact on
QoL, and its costs. In the current study, we performed a
cost-effectiveness analysis that accounted for each of these
factors and observed that cDC was cost-effective compared with sDC. Our results indicate that the slightly
lower QoL, higher costs, and additional need for bone
marrow support observed in the cDC group are offset by
the superior PFS achieved in this group.
Our results are in agreement with a previous costeffectiveness analysis of the available regimens for the
treatment of platinum-sensitive recurrence, in which we
observed that combined carboplatin and paclitaxel potentially was cost-effective compared with single-agent carboplatin.9 Women with platinum-sensitive recurrences
often are able to achieve durable responses and lengthy
second remissions during which they have good QoL, factors that favor the use of aggressive regimens in this setting.10 In the current study, combination therapy using
cDC remained cost-effective even when prospectively collected QoL data indicating lower QoL during treatment
were incorporated into the analysis. In contrast, platinum-resistant recurrence is associated with a dismal prognosis. Rocconi et al previously reported that the only
potentially cost-effective management strategies for platinum-resistant recurrence were single-agent treatments
and supportive care.11
Our study is strengthened by the results from a
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, which simultaneously
accounts for uncertainty in each of the model’s parameters. In Monte Carlo analysis using $50,000 per QALY as
the ‘‘willingness to pay’’ threshold, cDC is the clear treatment of choice in 83% of simulations. If the willingness
to pay threshold is set at $100,000 per QALY, which is
becoming common practice in modern cost-effectiveness
studies in oncology,12,13 then cDC becomes the treatment
of choice in 94% of simulations. The 95% confidence
intervals for the ICER of cDC are fairly wide, ranging
from negative values (which means that cDC is both more

Cancer

effective and less expensive than sDC) to $135,105 per
QALY. The wide confidence intervals of the ICER may
be related to the small size of the randomized controlled
trial (n ¼ 75 in each arm) and the uncertainty surrounding utility estimates, which also were incorporated using
their 95% confidence intervals.
There are several limitations to the current study.
First is the lack of prospectively collected health care use
data from which to calculate costs. We used trial-reported
adverse event rates and rates of bone marrow support to
approximate cost differences between groups, and this
method may result in over estimating or under estimating
costs. Second, we were not able to incorporate differences
in productivity or caregiver expenses between treatment
arms, because these also were not collected prospectively.
A third limitation is that, despite the availability of prospectively collected QoL data using the FACT scale, we
lacked prospectively collected utilities data. Although we
were able to convert the FACT scale to a utility using a
previously described method,8 the referenced study used
the preference of a set of nonovarian cancer patients to
derive utilities from the FACT-G questionnaire. The
standard in a cost-effectiveness analysis performed from
the standpoint of a third party is to use societal-based
rather than patient-based preferences for utility derivation.14 With this limitation acknowledged, we believe
that the incorporation of a patient preference-based utility
lends credibility to our assessment, because QoL is a critical factor in the treatment of recurrent cancer.
In conclusion, we used prospectively collected
results from a randomized controlled trial to construct a
cost-utility model to demonstrate that combined docetaxel and carboplatin is cost-effective compared with sequential docetaxel followed by carboplatin for the
treatment of recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.
Decisions about the treatment of platinum-sensitive recurrence optimally should be made with attention to the
potential PFS afforded by each treatment, its treatment
costs, adverse event rates, and differences in treatmentrelated QoL.
