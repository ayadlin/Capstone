Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) almost two decades ago established a new paradigm of
gene regulation. During the past ten years these tiny non-coding RNAs have been linked to
virtually all known physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. In the same way as
certain key protein-coding genes, miRNAs can be deregulated in cancer, in which they can
function as a group to mark differentiation states or individually as bona fide oncogenes or tumour
suppressors. Importantly, miRNA biology can be harnessed experimentally to investigate cancer
phenotypes or used therapeutically as a target for drugs or as the drug itself.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, evolutionarily conserved, non-coding RNAs of 18–25
nucleotides in length that have an important function in gene regulation. Mature miRNA
products are generated from a longer primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcript through
sequential processing by the ribonucleases Drosha and Dicer1 (ref. 1). The first description
of miRNAs was made in 1993 in Caenorhabditis elegans as regulators of developmental
timing2,3. Later, miRNAs were shown to inhibit their target genes through sequences that
are complementary to the target messenger RNA, leading to decreased expression of the
target protein1 (Box 1). This discovery resulted in a pattern shift in our understanding of
gene regulation because miRNAs are now known to repress thousands of target genes and
coordinate normal processes, including cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.
The aberrant expression or alteration of miRNAs also contributes to a range of human
pathologies, including cancer.

The control of gene expression by miRNAs is a process seen in virtually all cancer cells.
These cells show alterations in their miRNA expression profiles, and emerging data indicate
that these patterns could be useful in improving the classification of cancers and predicting
their behaviour. In addition, miRNAs have now been shown to behave as cancer ‘drivers’ in
the same way as protein-coding genes whose alterations actively and profoundly contribute
to malignant transformation and cancer progression. Owing to the capacity of miRNAs to
modulate tens to hundreds of target genes, they are emerging as important factors in the
control of the ‘hallmarks’ of cancer4. In this Review, we summarize the findings that
provide evidence for the central role of miRNAs in controlling cellular transformation and
tumour progression. We also highlight the potential uses of miRNAs and miRNA-based
drugs in cancer therapy and discuss the obstacles that will need to be overcome.

miRNAs are cancer genes
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In 2002, Croce and colleagues first demonstrated that an miRNA cluster was frequently
deleted or downregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia5. This discovery suggested that
non-coding genes were contributing to the development of cancer, and paved the way for the
closer investigation of miRNA loss or amplification in tumours. Subsequently, miRNAs
were shown to be differentially expressed in cancer cells, in which they formed distinct and
unique miRNA expression patterns6, and whole classes of miRNAs could be controlled
directly by key oncogenic transcription factors7. In parallel, studies with mouse models
established that miRNAs were actively involved in tumorigenesis8. Collectively, these
findings provided the first key insights into the relevance of miRNA biology in human
cancer.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Despite these results, the sheer extent of involvement of miRNAs in cancer was not
anticipated. miRNA genes are usually located in small chromosomal alterations in tumours
(in amplifications, deletions or linked to regions of loss of heterozygosity) or in common
chromosomal-breakpoints that are associated with the development of cancer9. In addition to
structural genetic alterations, miRNAs can also be silenced by promoter DNA methylation
and loss of histone acetylation10. Interestingly, somatic translocations in miRNA target sites
can also occur, representing a drastic means of altering miRNA function11,12. The frequent
deregulation of individual or clusters of miRNAs at multiple levels mirrors the deregulation
for protein-coding oncogenes or tumour suppressors (Table 1).
In principle, somatic mutations that change an miRNA seed sequence could lead to the
aberrant repression of tumour-suppressive mRNAs, but these seem to be infrequent13.
Further sequencing could change this view, but this observation suggests that the intensity of
miRNA signalling (altered by miRNA overexpression or underexpression) is more crucial
than the specificity of the response. However, recent data indicate that miRNAs with an
altered sequence can be produced through variable cleavage sites for Drosha and Dicer1,
and that the presence of these variants can be perturbed in cancer14. Although the function
of the variant ‘isomiRs’ remains unclear, in principle they could alter the quality of miRNA
effects. State-of-the-art sequencing techniques will help to unmask mutations or
modifications that otherwise would remain undetected. Whatever the mechanism, the
widespread alteration in the expression of miRNAs is a ubiquitous feature of cancer.

miRNAs as cancer classifiers

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Aberrant miRNA levels reflect the physiological state of cancer cells and can be detected by
miRNA expression profiling and harnessed for the purpose of diagnosis and prognosis15,16.
In fact, miRNA profiling can be more accurate at classifying tumours than mRNA profiling
because miRNA expression correlates closely with tumour origin and stage, and can be used
to classify poorly differentiated tumours that are difficult to identify using a standard
histological approach6,17. Whether or not this increased classification power relates to the
biology of miRNAs or the reduced complexity of the miRNA genome still needs to be
determined.
The special features of miRNAs make them potentially useful for detection in clinical
specimens. For example, miRNAs are relatively resistant to ribonuclease degradation, and
they can be easily extracted from small biopsies, frozen samples and even formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissues18 . Furthermore, relatively simple and reproducible assays have
been developed to detect the abundance of individual miRNAs, and methods that combine
small RNA isolation, PCR and next-generation sequencing, allow accurate and quantitative
assessment of all the miRNAs that are expressed in a patient specimen, including material
that has been isolated by laser capture microdissection. The detection of global miRNA

expression patterns for the diagnosis of cancers has not yet been proved; however, some
individual or small groups of miRNAs have shown promise. For example, in non-small cell
lung cancer, the combination of high miR-155 and low let-7 expression correlates with a
poor prognosis, and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia a 13 miRNA signature is associated
with disease progression15,16. Further advances in the technology of miRNA profiling could
help to revolutionize molecular pathology.
Perhaps the most appealing application of miRNAs as a cancer diagnostic tool comes from
the discovery of circulating miRNAs in serum. For example, miR-141 expression levels in
serum were significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer than in healthy control
individuals19. Although the analysis of circulating miRNAs is only just beginning, the
successful advancement of this technology could provide a relatively non-invasive
diagnostic tool for single-point or longitudinal studies. With such diagnostic tools in place,
miRNA profiling could be used to guide cancer classification, facilitate treatment decisions,
monitor treatment efficacy and predict clinical outcome.

When miRNA biogenesis goes awry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although the expression of some miRNAs is increased in malignant cells, the widespread
underexpression of miRNAs is a more common phenomenon. Whether this tendency is a
reflection of a pattern associated with specific cells of origin, is a consequence of the
malignant state or actively contributes to cancer development is still unclear. Because
miRNA expression generally increases as cells differentiate, the apparent underexpression of
miRNAs in cancer cells may, in part, be a result of miRNAs being ‘locked’ in a lessdifferentiated state. Alternatively, changes in oncogenic transcription factors that repress
miRNAs or variability in the expression or activity of the miRNA processing machinery
could also be important.
Two main mechanisms have been proposed as the underlying cause of the global
downregulation of miRNAs in cancer cells. One involves transcriptional repression by
oncogenic transcription factors. For example, the MYC oncoprotein, which is overexpressed
in many cancers, transcriptionally represses certain miRNAs, although the extent to which
this mediates its oncogenic activity or reflects a peripheral effect is still unknown20. The
other mechanism proposed involves changes in miRNA biogenesis and is based on the
observation that cancer cells often display reduced levels, or altered activity, of factors in the
miRNA biogenesis pathway21 (Box 1, Fig. 1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In vivo studies have provided the most direct evidence of an active role for miRNA
downregulation in at least some types of cancer. For example, analysis of mouse models in
which the core enzymes of miRNA biogenesis have been constitutively or conditionally
disrupted by different mechanisms suggests that these molecules function as
haploinsufficient tumour suppressors. Thus, the repression of miRNA processing by the
partial depletion of Dicer1 and Drosha accelerates cellular transformation and tumorigenesis
in vivo22. Furthermore, deletion of a single Dicer1 allele in lung epithelia promotes Krasdriven lung adenocarcinomas, whereas complete ablation of Dicer1 causes lethality because
of the need for miRNAs in essential processes23. Consistent with the potential relevance of
these mechanisms, reduced Dicer1 and Drosha levels have been associated with poor
prognosis in the clinic24. In addition to the core machinery, modulators of miRNA
processing can also function as haploinsufficient tumour suppressors. Hence, point
mutations that affect TARBP2 or XPO5 are correlated with sporadic and hereditary
carcinomas that have microsatellite instability25,26. Other miRNA modulators that influence
the processing of only a subset of miRNAs could also be important. For example, LIN28A
and LIN28B can bind and repress members of the let-7 family (which are established

Lujambio and Lowe

tumour-suppressor miRNAs; Table 1), but this binding can be counteracted by KHSRP
(KH-type splicing regulatory protein), also a factor involved in miRNA biogenesis; together
this binding and counteracting dictate the level of mature let-7. The processing of miRNAs
can be regulated by other genes including DDX5 (helicase p68) or the SMAD 1 and SMAD
5 proteins, which may contribute to cancer development through the deregulation of
miRNAs27. Collectively, the global changes in miRNA expression that are seen in cancer
cells probably arise through multiple mechanisms; the combined small changes in the
expression of many miRNAs seem to have a large impact on the malignant state.

miRNAs as cancer drivers
Functional studies show that miRNAs that are affected by somatic alterations in tumours can
affect cancer phenotypes directly, therefore confirming their driver function in malignancy.
As drivers of malignancy, mechanistic studies show that these miRNAs interact with known
cancer networks; hence, tumour-suppressor miRNAs can negatively regulate protein-coding
oncogenes, whereas oncogenic miRNAs often repress known tumour suppressors (Fig. 2a).
Perhaps the best example of this is the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster, in which individual
miRNAs suppress negative regulators of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase signalling or
pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family, which disrupts the processes that are known to
influence cancer development28 (Table 1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cancer-associated miRNAs can also alter the epigenetic landscape of cancer cells. The
cancer ‘epigenome’ is characterized by global and gene-specific changes in DNA
methylation, histone modification patterns and chromatin-modifying enzyme expression
profiles, which impact gene expression in a heritable way29. In one way, miRNA expression
can be altered by DNA methylation or histone modifications in cancer cells10,30, but
miRNAs can also regulate components of the epigenetic machinery, therefore indirectly
contributing to the reprogramming of cancer cells. For example, miR-29 inhibits DNMT3A
DNMT3B expression in lung cancer31, whereas miR-101 regulates the histone
methyltransferase EZH2 in prostate cancer32. The presence of mature miRNAs in the
nucleus33 is another indication of the potentially direct role that miRNAs have in controlling
epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications — a
hypothesis that has been established in plants34 but still needs to be demonstrated with
certainty in mammals.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the same way as protein-coding genes, miRNAs can be oncogenes or tumour suppressors
depending on the cellular context in which they are expressed, which means that defining
their precise contribution to cancer can be a challenge (Fig. 2b). The fact that miRNAs show
tissue-specific expression and their output, shown in the cell’s physiology, is dependent on
the expression pattern of the specific mRNAs that harbour target sites could explain this
apparent paradox. For example, the miR-29 family has a tumour-suppressive effect in lung
tumours but appears oncogenic in breast cancer because of its ability to target the DNA
methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, and ZFP36, respectively31,35 (Table 1).
To further complicate the process, some miRNAs repress several positive components of a
pathway, whereas others target both positive and negative regulators, possibly to buffer
against minor physiological variations that could trigger much larger changes in the cell
physiology36 In cancer cells, this buffering role can mean that some miRNAs could
simultaneously target oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. In addition, combinations of
miRNAs can cooperate to regulate one or several pathways, which increases the flexibility
of regulation but confounds experimentalists37 (Fig. 2c). Consequently, the way in which
miRNAs contribute to cancer development is conceptually similar to cancer-associated
transcription factors such as MYC and p53, which are mediated through many targets that

Lujambio and Lowe

depend on contextual factors that are influenced by cell type and micro-environment. From a
practical perspective it is crucial that miRNA targets are studied in a context that is
appropriate to the environment that is being studied to determine what impact they will have
on tumour cell behaviour (Fig. 2b).

Oncogenic pathways
Beyond the impact of somatic genetic and epigenetic lesions, the altered expression of
miRNAs in cancer can arise through the aberrant activity of transcription factors that control
their expression. Interestingly, the same transcription factors are often targets of miRNAmediated repression, which gives rise to complex regulatory circuits and feedback
mechanisms. Thus, a single transcription factor can activate or repress several miRNAs and
protein-coding genes; in turn, the alteration in miRNA expression can affect more proteincoding genes that then amplifies the effects of a single gene.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As already mentioned, MYC directly contributes to the global transcriptional silencing of
miRNAs20. This repression involves the downregulation of miRNAs with antiproliferative,
antitumorigenic and pro-apoptotic activity such as, let-7, miR-15a/16-1, miR-26a or miR-34
family members38 (Fig. 2d; Table 1). Initial studies indicate that Myc uses both
transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms to modulate miRNA expression. This
phenomenon could be due to LIN28A and LIN28B being the direct target of MYC, and that
they are required for MYC-mediated repression of let-7 (ref. 38). Furthermore, MYC
directly activates the transcription of miR-17-92 polycistronic cluster and, given its
oncogenic role, it may contribute to MYC-induced tumorigenesis39.
MYC-driven reprogramming of miRNA expression could also be a factor in hepatocellular
carcinoma, because of the contribution the reprogramming has to the aggressive phenotype
of tumours originating from hepatic progenitor cells40. Some miRNAs, such as let-7, also
regulate MYC, closing the regulatory circuit37.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

miRNAs are embedded in many other oncogenic networks, including KRAS activation,
which leads to the repression of several miRNAs. For example, in pancreatic cancer with
mutant KRAS, RAS-responsive element-binding protein 1 (RREB1) represses miR-143 and
miR-145 promoter, and at the same time both KRAS and RREB1 are targets of miR-143 and
miR-145, revealing a feedforward mechanism that increases the effect of RAS signalling41.
Similarly, KRAS is a target for several miRNAs, of which the let-7 family is the most
representative example42. The integration of miRNAs into key oncogenic pathways, and the
generation of feedforward and feedback loops that have a balancing effect, creates intricate
ways to incorporate intracellular and extracellular signals in the decisions of cell
proliferation or survival, and further implicates miRNAs in the pathogenesis of cancer.

TP53 is a master regulator of miRNAs
The TP53 tumour suppressor is perhaps the most important and well-studied cancer gene,
and it is not surprising that several studies have suggested that miRNA biology can have a
role in its regulation and activity (Fig. 2e). The p53 protein acts as a sequence-specific
DNA-binding factor that can activate and repress transcription. Although there is no doubt
that most of the actions of p53 can be explained by its ability to control canonical proteincoding targets such as CDKN1A and PUMA, it can also transactivate several miRNAs. One
of the best-studied classes is the miR-34 family (Table 1), which represses genes that can
promote proliferation and apoptosis — plausible targets in a p53-mediated tumoursuppressor response43. In principle, the action of p53 to induce the expression of miR-34
and other miRNAs can explain some of its transcriptional repressive functions.

The discovery of additional p53-regulated miRNAs, and the targeting of p53 or its pathway
by other miRNAs, has provided general insights into the miRNA-mediated control of gene
expression and the potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting the p53 network (Fig.
2e). Several p53-activated miRNAs, such as miR-192, miR-194, miR-215 and miR-605, can
target MDM2, which is a negative regulator of p53 and a therapeutic target. These
potentially relevant miRNAs can be epigenetically silenced in some types of cancer;
however, their reactivation or reintroduction (see the section miRNAs as drugs and drug
targets) offers an intriguing therapeutic opportunity for inhibiting MDM2 in tumours that
harbour wild-type p53 (refs 44, 45). Similarly, p53 can also activate miR-107, miR-200 or
miR-192, which are miRNAs that inhibit angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition46–48. Conversely, p53 can be repressed by certain oncogenic miRNAs including
miR-380-5p, which is upregulated in neuroblastomas with MYCN amplification, or
miR-504, which decreases p53-mediated apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest and can promote
tumorigenesis49,50. However, the extent to which these miRNAs control life and death
decisions in the p53 network still needs to be shown decisively to determine whether these
miRNAs are valid therapeutic targets.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The studies mentioned have extended our understanding of the roles and regulation of p53
into the world of small non-coding RNAs, but the action on miRNA biology may be even
more complex. For example, one study51 suggests that p53 can affect miRNA biogenesis by
promoting pri-miRNA processing through association with the large Drosha complex (Fig.
2e), but the precise mechanism remains unclear51. In a more conventional way, the p53
family member p63 transcriptionally controls Dicer1 expression. Mutant TP53 can interfere
with this regulation, which leads to a reduction in Dicer1 levels and reduces the levels of
certain cancer-relevant miRNAs52. Thus, with the p53 network as a typical example, it is
clear that miRNAs can interact with cancer-relevant pathways at multiple and unexpected
levels and that a better understanding of miRNA biology will help to decipher the role and
function of other important cancer genes.

Micromanagement of metastasis and beyond

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to promoting cancer initiation, miRNAs can modulate processes that support
cancer progression, including metastasis53–56. As indicated earlier, changes in miRNA
levels can occur through effects on their transcription or by global changes in the RNA
interference (RNAi) machinery, and both mechanisms seem to be important for this process.
For example, in breast cancer, miR-10b and miR-9 can induce metastasis, whereas miR-126,
miR-335 and miR-31 act as suppressors. The miR-200 family inhibits epithelial-tomesenchymal transition, which influences one aspect of the metastatic process57. However,
miR-200 could also promote the colonization of metastatic cells in breast cancer, which
provides yet another example of the opposing activities of some miRNAs58. Conversely, in
head and neck squamous-cell carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas and breast cancers, the
reduced levels of certain miRNAs that arise from Dicer1 downregulation also promote cell
motility and are associated with enhanced metastasis in experimental models52,59.
The pleiotropic effects of miRNA biology on cancer extend to virtually all acquired cancer
traits, including cancer-associated changes in intracellular metabolism and the tissue
microenvironment. For example, most cancer cells display alterations in glucose metabolism
termed the Warburg effect60. miRNAs may contribute to this metabolic switch because, in
glioma cells, miR-451 controls cell proliferation, migration and responsiveness to glucose
deprivation, thereby allowing the cells to survive metabolic stress61. The enhanced
glutaminolysis observed in cancer cells can be partially explained by MYC-mediated
repression of miR-23a and miR-23b (ref. 62) (Fig. 2d). In some cases, the control of these
cancer-related processes by miRNAs creates an opportunity for new therapeutic approaches.

Hence, miR-132, which is present in the endothelium of tumours but not in normal human
endothelium, induces neovascularization by inhibition of p120RasGAP, a negative regulator
of KRAS63. The delivery of a miR-132 inhibitor with nanoparticles that target the tumour
vasculature suppresses angiogenesis in mice; this indicates there is a potential for the
development of new antiangiogenic drugs. Further studies are likely to implicate miRNAs in
the modulation of every tumour-associated pathway or trait.

Big lessons from mice
Much of what we have learnt concerning the functional contribution of miRNA biology to
cancer development comes from studies in genetically engineered mice. These systems
provide powerful tools for the genetic and biological study of miRNAs in an in vivo context,
which is particularly important given the contextual activity of most miRNAs. In addition,
owing to the ability of these models to recapitulate the behaviour of some human
malignancies, they are useful in preclinical studies to evaluate new therapeutics.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Perhaps the most widespread use of mice for characterizing miRNA biology in cancer is the
validation of miRNAs that are altered in cancer cells, as bona fide oncogenes and tumour
suppressor genes. As already mentioned, the first direct evidence that miRNAs have a
function in cancer came from mouse models, in which it was shown that expression of the
miR-17-92 cluster — which is amplified in some human B cell lymphomas — cooperates
with Myc to promote B-cell lymphoma in mice8. Subsequent studies that have used
genetically engineered or transplantation-based systems identified the relevant miRNA
components, showing that the miR-19 family (including miR-19a and miR-19b) represents
the most potent oncogenes in this cluster28,64,65.
Another example is miR-155 overexpression in the lymphoid compartment, which triggers
B-cell leukaemia or a myeloproliferative disorder depending on the system used to drive
expression of the transgene; this was the first example of an miRNA that initiates cancer in a
transgenic setting66,67 (Table 1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Gene targeting has been used extensively to delete miRNAs for the purpose of
characterizing their physiological roles or action as candidate tumour suppressors. Gene
targeting has suggested that miRNAs from similar families have redundant or compensatory
functions, which has been shown for C. elegans68. Ablation of the miR-15a and miR-16-1
cluster, which is often deleted in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, predisposes mice
to B-cell lymphoproliferative disease69 (Table 1). Importantly, the ability to produce mouse
strains with different gene dosage through heterozygous or homozygous gene deletions has
revealed that Dicer1, which if lost completely has a deleterious effect, can promote
malignant phenotypes as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor23. Such a conclusion could
not be formed from studies that examined only genomic data.
Conditional gene expression systems in mice have allowed researchers to determine cancer
gene dependencies, as well as whether genes that initiate cancer also participate in tumour
maintenance. In many cases, withdrawal of the initiating oncogenic transgene (or restoration
of the deleted or lost tumour suppressor) leads to the collapse of the tumour; this validates
the transgene or pathway that is controlled by these genes, as a therapeutic target. Similar
studies have also been applied to miR-NAs; for example, conditional expression of miR-21,
which is broadly deregulated in cancer, can promote lymphomagenesis in mice70 (Table 1).
Silencing of miR-21 leads to disease regression, in part, by promoting apoptosis70 (Fig. 3a).
Likewise, the use of miRNA inhibitors (for example, antagomirs) directed against miR-21
can inhibit the proliferation of human cancer cells that overexpress miR-21 (ref. 71).
Together, these studies suggest that miR-21 antagonists have the potential to be effective
therapies for at least some cancers.

The development of new technology has meant that mouse models are increasingly used to
study gene function on a large if not genome-wide scale, and miRNAs are at the forefront of
this revolution. Recently, a vast collection of mouse embryonic stem-cell clones that harbour
deletions that target 392 miRNA genes was generated72. This unique and valuable toolbox,
termed ‘mirKO’, will allow the creation of mice that lack specific miRNAs, express mutant
miRNAs or the study of their expression. In a converse strategy, a collection of embryonic
stem cells engineered to inducibly express the vast majority of known miRNAs is in
production (S.W.L., Y. Park and G. Hannon, manuscript in preparation) and will allow the
in vivo validation of miRNAs as oncogenes or as anticancer therapies. With a different
strategy, miRNA sponges (Fig. 3b), which are oligonucleotide constructs with multiple
complementary miRNA binding sites in tandem, have already been used to deplete
individual miRNAs in transgenic fruitflies, in transplanted breast cancer cells in mice and in
a transgenic mouse model56,73,74. Although these sponges provide a scalable strategy for
miRNA loss-of-function studies, more work is needed to rule out off-target effects and
assess their potency before conclusions can be made. However, the availability of such
resources will help with the functional study of miRNAs in normal development and
disease, and will be useful to the wider scientific community.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally, genetically engineered mouse models of human cancers are a testing ground for
preclinical studies. For example, in Myc-induced liver tumours, miR-26 delivery by adenoassociated viruses suppresses tumorigenesis by inducing apoptosis75. The increasing use of
state-of-the-art mouse models is likely to uncover new in vivo functions, such as metastasis
and angiogenesis, that otherwise would have remained hidden in vitro. They will also
provide key preclinical systems for testing miRNA-based therapeutics.

Constructing and deconstructing cancer
The use of RNAi technology — a tool that exploits miRNA pathways — has revolutionized
the study of gene function in mammalian systems and has provided a powerful means to
investigate the function of any protein-coding gene. Experimental triggers of RNAi exploit
different aspects of the pathway and result in the downregulation of gene expression through
incorporation into the miRNA biogenesis machinery at different points76. Small-interfering
RNAs (siRNAs), which function at the level of Dicer1, can transiently and potently lead to
gene suppression; these RNAi triggers, or their variants, are probably the structural
‘scaffold’ for miRNA therapeutics (see the section miRNAs as drugs or drug targets).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Stable RNAi can be activated by the expression of miRNA mimetics, that are either the socalled stem loop short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or shRNAs that incorporate a larger miRNA
fold. One example of the latter is based on miR-30 (known as miR-30-based shRNAs or
‘shRNAmirs’). These shRNAs, as occurs naturally for many miRNAs, can be embedded in
non-coding sequences of protein-coding transcripts or linked in tandem, which allows, for
example, the linkage of the shRNA with a fluorescent reporter or the simultaneous
knockdown of two different genes77,78. Advances in the shRNAmir methodology have
allowed the development of versatile vectors for the study of proliferation and survival
genes, strategies for optimizing the potency of shRNAs, and rapid and effective systems for
conditional shRNA expression in mice79–81. The last of these, together with systems based
on short stem-loop shRNAs82, could eventually allow the spatial, temporal and reversible
control of any gene in vivo.
Regardless of the platform, RNAi technology provides an effective tool to investigate cancer
phenotypes and identify therapeutic targets. For example, RNAi has been used to identify
and characterize tumour-suppressor genes, which if inhibited promote cancer development.
Early studies, using the same system that validated miR-17-92 as an oncogene,

demonstrated that inhibition of TP53 could produce phenotypes that were consistent with
TP53 loss83. Later studies showed that tumour suppressors could be identified prospectively
using in vitro and in vivo shRNA screens, (for examples see refs 84 and 85). By
conditionally expressing shRNAs that target tumour suppressors in mice, tumour-suppressor
function in advanced tumours can be re-established by silencing the shRNA86. Tumoursuppressor reactivation leads to a marked (if not complete) tumour regression, which
validates these pathways as therapeutic targets.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RNAi technology can be exploited more directly to identify genotype-specific cancer drug
targets. Although there may be differences in the outcome of RNAi and small-moleculemediated protein inhibition, siRNAs and shRNAs have been widely used to determine
whether a candidate target is required for the proliferation of cancer cells. Moreover, the
availability of RNAi libraries that target portions of, or all, the human genome allows
genetic screens to identify ‘synthetic lethal’ genes, for which, if combined, the attenuation
triggers the death of the cell. In principle, the identification of an RNAi target, the inhibition
of which is selectively lethal to cells harbouring a particular oncogenic alteration, should
identify cancer-specific targets. Such approaches have identified potential targets for KRASexpressing tumours87–89 and leukaemias with deregulated MYC (ref. 90). Application of
these approaches could potentially be complementary to the traditional drug-target discovery
approach, and possibly a systematic way to identify the combination of therapies that will
ultimately be needed to combat cancer.

miRNAs as drugs and drug targets

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Despite advances in techniques to inhibit protein-coding genes using small molecules or
biologicals, many cancers are unresponsive to the agents currently in use or become resistant
to them; new and more creative approaches are therefore required for the treatment of
cancer. Perhaps one of the most exciting opportunities that has arisen from our
understanding of miRNA biology is the potential use of miRNA mimics or antagonists as
therapeutics. Owing to the ability of miRNAs to simultaneously target multiple genes and
pathways that are involved in cellular proliferation and survival38, the targeting of a single
miRNA can be a form of ‘combination’ therapy that could obstruct feedback and
compensatory mechanisms that would otherwise limit the effectiveness of many therapies in
current use. In addition, because miRNA expression is often altered in cancer cells, agents
that modulate miRNA activity could potentially produce cancer-specific effects10,91,92 .
Based on this, anticancer therapies that inhibit or enhance miRNA activity are being
developed (Fig. 4). Evidence for this is shown by the inhibition of oncogenic miRNAs or the
expression of tumour suppressor miRNAs in mice that harbour tumours, which have a
significant effect on the outcome of cancer. Oncogenic miRNAs can be blocked by using
antisense oligonucleotides, antagomirs, sponges or locked nucleic acid (LNA) constructs93.
The use of LNAs has achieved unexpected success in vivo, not only in mice but also for the
treatment of hepatitis C in non-human primates94. The downregulation of miR-122 can lead
to a significant inhibition of replication of the hepatitis C virus. This inhibition is thought to
decrease the risk of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients who are
hepatitis C-positive. Early clinical studies using SPC3649, an miR-122 antagonist, in
healthy individuals to assess toxicity will provide valuable information about
pharmacokinetics and safety of the treatment. LNAs have been optimized to target miRNAs
by reducing their molecular size and this, along with developing strategies for more efficient
delivery, has increased their therapeutic potential95. By contrast, another strategy involves
the restoration of tumour -suppressor miRNA expression by synthetic miRNA mimics or
viral delivery93. Both of these approaches have yielded positive results in mouse models of
cancer75,96. Adeno-associated virus delivery of miRNAs or miRNA antagonists has the
advantage of being efficient and, because the virus does not integrate into the genome, non-

mutagenic. However, the delivery and safety of treatment needs to be improved before this
approach can achieve widespread clinical use.

In principle, the use of miRNA mimetics as therapeutics would allow ‘drugging the
undruggable’ or the therapeutic inhibition of virtually any human gene. If this were possible
it would undoubtedly impact many diseases including cancer by allowing the targeting of
oncogenic transcription factors that are difficult to inhibit through traditional medicinal
chemistry97. Furthermore, owing to the similar chemistry that is used to create drugs that
target diverse molecules, the implementation of miRNA-based therapies could allow a more
uniform drug development pipeline than is possible for more conventional treatments.
Although experimental studies have validated the underlying biological impact of achieving
miRNA modulation, there are still practical challenges that prevent the use of miRNA
mimetics and antagonists clinically, including uncharacterized off-target effects, toxicities
and poor agent-delivery. Concerning the last of these, most miRNA mimetics and
antagonists rely on the delivery of molecules that mimic or inhibit the ‘seed’ sequence of an
miRNA (typically molecules that consist of ≥6 nucleotides or related structures) across the
plasma membrane — a particular challenge in the treatment of cancer, in which missing
even a few cancer cells could lead to tumour relapse and progression. Extensive research is
now focused on the viral and non-viral strategies required to meet this challenge, and results
in the preclinical setting are promising75,94–96. Despite the considerable hurdles that have to
be overcome, it seems likely that miRNAs will find a place alongside more conventional
approaches for the treatment of cancer.

Perspectives

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since the discovery of miRNAs in model organisms, miRNAs have emerged as key
regulators of normal development and a diversity of normal cellular processes. Given what
we know now, it is not surprising that perturbations in miRNA biogenesis or expression can
contribute to disease. In cancer, the effects of miRNA alteration can be widespread and
profound, and they touch on virtually all aspects of the malignant phenotype. Yet, precisely
how miRNAs regulate the expression of protein-coding genes is not completely understood,
and the underlying mechanism remains an important basic-science question that will have a
significant impact on our understanding of gene regulation and its alteration in disease. In
addition, we still lack effective approaches to understand and predict miRNA targets. New
strategies to identify and characterize the targets of individual miRNAs, and to determine
how they function in combination to regulate specific targets, will be required to understand
their action on cell physiology. Because miRNAs can also regulate other non-coding RNAs
(for example, long non-coding RNAs), which have a role in cancer development and vice
versa98, these interactions will increase the complexity of gene regulation and are likely to
produce regulatory processes that are currently hidden. Pioneering knowledge, gained
through the study of miRNA function and regulation, will undoubtedly provide
methodological and theoretical insights that will help in our understanding of the more
recently identified non-coding RNA species.
Understanding miRNA biology and how it contributes to cancer development is not only an
academic exercise, but also provides an opportunity for the generation of new ideas for
diagnosis and treatment. RNAi-based technology has allowed sophisticated loss-of-function
experiments that were previously impossible and has revealed therapeutic targets that, when
inhibited, can lead to cancer cell elimination. In addition, miRNAs themselves are being
used directly in the diagnosis of cancer and, in the future, will probably be exploited in
therapy to identify drug targets or as the drug treatment. However, cost-effective miRNA
profiling strategies and larger studies are needed to determine whether miRNA profiling
provides an advantage for cancer classification compared with a more traditional approach.

Although drugs that function as miRNA mimetics, antagonists or synthetic siRNAs form the
core of what is fundamentally a new class of drugs that are capable of targeting molecules
outside the range of traditional medicinal chemistry, their clinical implementation will
require improvements in drug composition and delivery; these challenges lie outside the
scope of molecular biology and instead involve the fields of chemistry and nanotechnology.
Nevertheless, the successful development of these technologies could ultimately translate
our understanding of miRNA biology in cancer into strategies for the control of cancer.

Biogenesis and function of miRNAs
miRNAs are subjected to a unique biogenesis that is closely related to their regulatory
functions. As the pathway in Fig. 1 shows, in general miRNAs are transcribed by RNA
polymerase II into primary transcripts called pri-miRNAs76. The primary transcripts
contain a 5′ cap structure a poly(A)+ tail and may include introns, similar to the
transcripts of protein-coding genes76. They also contain a region in which the sequences
are not perfectly complementary, known as the stem–loop structure, which is recognized
in the nucleus by the ribonuclease Drosha and its partner DGCR8, giving rise to the
precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by cropping76. However, some intronic miRNAs (called
mirtrons) bypass the Drosha processing step and, instead, use splicing machinery to
generate the pre-miRNA99. The pre-miRNA is exported from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm by XPO5 and is further cleaved by the ribonuclease Dicer1 (along with
TARBP2) into a double-stranded miRNA (process known as dicing)76. Again, this
cleavage can be substituted by Argonaute-2-mediated processing100.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

After strand separation, the guide strand or mature miRNA forms, in combination with
Argonaute proteins, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whereas the passenger
strand is usually degraded. The mature strand is important for specific-target mRNA
recognition and its consequent incorporation into the RISC1. The specificity of miRNA
targeting is defined by how complementary the ‘seed’ sequence (positions 2 to 8 from the
5′ end of the miRNA) and the ‘seed-match’ sequence (generally in the 3′ untranslated
region of the target mRNA) are. The expression of the target mRNAs is silenced by
miRNAs, either by mRNA cleavage (‘slicing’) or by translational repression1. In
addition, miRNAs have a number of unexpected functions, including the targeting of
DNA, ribonucleoproteins or increasing the expression of a target mRNA93. Overall, data
indicate the complexity of miRNA-mediated gene regulation and highlight the
importance of a better understanding of miRNA biology.

Figure 1. Mechanisms of miRNA perturbation in cancer

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cancer cells present global downregulation of miRNAs, loss of tumour-suppressor miRNAs
and specific accumulation of oncogenic miRNAs. The alteration in miRNA expression
patterns leads to the accumulation of oncogenes and downregulation of tumour-suppressor
genes, which leads to the promotion of cancer development. a, The expression and function
of oncogenic miRNAs is increased by genomic amplification, activating mutations, loss of
epigenetic silencing and transcriptional activation. By contrast, tumour-suppressor miRNAs
are lost by genomic deletion, inactivating mutations, epigenetic silencing or transcriptional
repression. b, After transcription, global levels of miRNAs can be reduced by impaired
miRNA biogenesis. Inactivating mutations and reduced expression have been described for
almost all the members of the miRNA processing machinery. If there is a downreguation of
DROSHA this can lead to a decrease in the cropping of primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) to
precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). In the case of XPO5 mutation, pre-miRNAs are prevented
from being exported to the cytoplasm. Mutation of TARBP2 or downregulation of DICER1
results in a decrease in mature miRNA levels. Pol II, RNA polymerase II; RISC, RNAinduced silencing complex.

Figure 2. Contribution of miRNAs to cancer pathways

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, Tumour-suppressor miRNAs, which repress oncogenes in healthy cells, are lost in cancer
cells, leading to oncogene upregulation, whereas oncogenic miRNAs inhibit tumoursuppressor genes, giving rise to cancer. b, The presence of different target genes in different
cell lines can modify the function of an miRNA, both in healthy cells and cancer cells,
which can lead to the development of cancer or a different outcome. c, Two miRNAs can
function together to regulate one or several pathways, which reinforces those pathways and
can result in the development of cancer. d, The oncogene MYC can either repress tumoursuppressor miRNAs (in blue) or activate oncogenic miRNAs (in red) and can therefore
orchestrate several different pathways. MYC can repress let-7, directly, or indirectly,
through LIN28 activation. Conversely, let-7 can also repress MYC, which closes the
regulatory circle. e, Tumour suppressor p53 can regulate several tumour suppressor miRNAs
(blue), activating different antitumoral pathways. The regulation of MDM2 by some of these
miRNAs leads to interesting feedforward loops. At the same time, p53 can be negatively
regulated by oncogenic miRNAs (in red). In addition, p53 is involved in the biogenesis of
several tumour suppressor miRNAs.

a, Tetracycline (Tet)-mediated miRNA inactivation or activation by doxycycline
administration using Tet-OFF, in which a tissue-specific promoter (TSP) is combined with a
transactivator (tTA) to turn on expression of oncogenic miRNA (purple) and induce
tumorigenesis (purple star) and subsequent tumour regression, revealing dependence on the
oncogenic miRNA, or Tet-ON systems in which a reverse transactivator (rtTA) switches on
oncogenic miRNA when the drug is applied. Drug withdrawal leads to tumour regression. b,
Tet-mediated miRNA activation or inactivation by doxycycline administration using TetOFF or Tet-ON systems. miRNAs (green) can be inhibited by miRNA sponges (dark blue),
with the same effects as miRNA expression, leading to tumorigenesis and subsequent
tumour regression, which indicates a dependence on tumour-suppressor loss.

miRNA-based therapy

a, miRNA expression profiles of potential patients could be assessed by measuring
circulating miRNAs in patient serum or tumoral miRNAs from a biopsy. For example,
miR-21 expression and miR-26 loss could be detected in serum and tumour samples. b, This
profile could be used for early detection of cancer, accurate diagnosis and prognosis, and
choosing the best therapeutic strategy. The best available chemotherapeutic option could be
combined with miRNA-based therapy. c, The oncomiRs detected in miRNA profiling and
those present in the tumour, such as miR-21, could be inhibited by using different strategies,
such as locked nucleic acid constructs. By contrast, the expression of tumour-suppressor
miRNAs downregulated in the tumour could be restored and miR-26 levels could be
increased with miRNA mimics. d, After treatment, the patient could be checked for relapse
by periodically studying circulating miRNAs from serum in a non-invasive manner. The
presence of miR-21 could indicate a potential relapse, and treatment would resume (black
arrows).
