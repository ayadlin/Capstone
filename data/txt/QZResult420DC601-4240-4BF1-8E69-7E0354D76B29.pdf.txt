Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia
associated with a loss of mass and activity of skeletal muscle. In addition to
energy deprivation, increased mitochondrial ROS damage proteins and lipids in
aged skeletal muscle. Therefore, prevention of mitochondrial ROS is important
for potential therapeutic strategies to delay sarcopenia. This study elucidates the
pharmacological efficiency of the new developed mitochondria-targeted ROS and
electron scavenger, XJB-5-131 (XJB) to restore muscle contractility and mitochondrial
function in aged skeletal muscle. Male adult (5-month old) and aged (29-month old)
Fischer Brown Norway (F344/BN) rats were treated with XJB for four weeks and
contractile properties of single skeletal muscle fibres and activity of mitochondrial
ETC complexes were determined at the end of the treatment period. XJB-treated
old rats showed higher muscle contractility associated with prevention of protein
oxidation in both muscle homogenate and mitochondria compared with untreated
counterparts. XJB-treated animals demonstrated a high activity of the respiratory
complexes I, III, and IV with no changes in citrate synthase activity. These data
demonstrate that mitochondrial ROS play a causal role in muscle weakness, and
that a ROS scavenger specifically targeted to mitochondria can reverse age-related
alterations of mitochondrial function and improve contractile properties in skeletal
muscle.

Introduction

mtDNA-encoded proteins associated with a progressive
loss of mitochondrial respiratory function [5-7]. As a
result, mitochondria of old muscles generate less ATP
and cannot provide adequate energy for muscle actions
contributing to sarcopenia. Human studies have correlated
age-related declines in O2 consumption [8] and ATP
synthesis [3] with reduced mitochondrial mass [9] and
oxidative phosphorylation activity [10]. Importantly,
mitochondrial dynamics significantly change with age
because sustained mitochondrial elongation induces
senescence-associated phenotypic changes in the cell,
resulting in low mitochondrial membrane potential, high
mtROS production, and mtDNA damage [11]. Giant,

The progressive age-related decline in skeletal
muscle mass and strength, known as sarcopenia,
involves changes in several metabolic pathways [1,
2]. Alterations in energy metabolism associated with
impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative capacity
are central events in aging myocytes [3, 4]. The main
alterations observed in mitochondria with aging
include: i) high mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) generation
associated with increased damage to proteins, lipids, and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), ii) activation of stress
response pathways, and iii) decreased expression of

dysfunctional mitochondria with highly interconnected
networks and ultrastructural abnormalities produce more
ROS and have a low autophagic activity that further
ablates the mitochondrial quality control in aged cells [12,
13].
While accumulation of mtROS plays a causal
role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, the contributions
of changes in the electron transfer chain (ETC) activity
and increases in mtROS to age-related muscle weakness
continues to be intensely debated. Furthermore, there is no
pharmacologic treatment to reverse mitochondrial deficits
in the elderly. Targeted expression of mitochondrial
catalase preserved structure and function of mitochondria

and extended lifespan [14, 15] that was associated with
reduced insulin resistance and muscle dysfunction in mice
[15]. Treatment with the mitochondria-targeted peptide
antioxidant SS-31 attenuated mitochondrial degeneration,
improved age-related skeletal muscle performance
[16] and protected the diaphragm against mechanical
ventilation-induced myofiber atrophy and contractile
dysfunction [17]. Likewise, a derivative of plastoquinone
(SkQ) exerted multiple anti-aging effects, prevented
ROS accumulation, and was especially effective during
the early and middle stages of aging [18]. These studies
provide a proof-of-principle for a causal role of mtROS
in sarcopenia and suggest the use of targeted antioxidant

Figure 1: Structure (A), and redox properties of XJB (B). XJB is effectively enriched in mitochondria, where the nitroxide
moiety acts as an ROS and electron/radical scavenger. Conversion of the nitroxide function into other oxidation states is reversible and
can contribute to catalytic ROS turnover through the following interactions (B). The one-electron reduction of the nitroxide (1) in the XJB
molecule generates a hydroxylamine (2), which can undergo a two-electron oxidation to the oxoammonium cation (3). Single-electron
reduction of the oxoammonium cation regenerates the nitroxide. Therefore, all of these N-O oxidation states can equilibrate as a function
of the redox state of the environment and the presence of glutathione and NAD(P)H [44]. Superoxide radical anion, as well as reactive
nitrogen species, react with all XJB N-O oxidation states and participate in the redox cycle (B) [45]. The nitroxide radical is also a superb
single-electron and radical acceptor, and can quench species originating from hydrogen atom abstraction by ROS, among other pathways
[46].

interventions as a promising and highly effective
therapeutic intervention.
A derivative of the antibiotic gramicidin S, XJB5-131 (XJB), is a recently developed antioxidant that
targets mitochondria and provides mtROS and electron
scavenging capacity by virtue of its conjugation to a
4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxy (4-AminoTEMPO) moiety [19]. The structure and redox properties
of XJB are summarized in Figure 1. The major antioxidant
capacity of XJB is likely to involve the scavenging of
electrons leaking from the ETC, rather than being caused
by an SOD-like mechanism [20]. XJB significantly
reduced the disease phenotype and improved mitochondrial
function of striatal synaptosomes in a mouse model
of Huntingtonâ€™s disease [21]. Mouse embryonic cells
pretreated with XJB demonstrated reduced apoptosis and
enhanced cell survival [22]. Intravenous administration of
XJB prevented ileal mucosal barrier dysfunction and tissue
ischemia associated with significantly prolonged survival
from hemorrhagic shock [23] and protected against global
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury [24] in rats. Our
recent studies demonstrated that hearts of XJB-treated
aged rats were resistant to ischemia-reperfusion injury, as
evidenced by improved post-ischemic recovery of cardiac
function and reduced cell death. Also, they exhibited
higher mitochondrial respiration rates than untreated agematched counterparts [25].
In this study, we determined the possible beneficial
effects of XJB on contractile properties and mitochondrial
ETC activity of skeletal muscle in aged rats. The results
demonstrated that aged animals treated with XJB possess
high muscle contractile activity associated with improved
mitochondrial function and decreased protein oxidation.

Due to the labor intensity and sample size needed
for the single fibre experiments we assessed single
muscle fibre size and contractile properties only in the
gastrocnemius muscle isolated from XJB-treated/untreated
old rats. Treatment with XJB had no effect on single fibre
dimensions (diameter, depth, and cross-sectional area)
(Figure 3). Analysis of contractile properties demonstrated
that XJB significantly increased the maximal unloaded
shortening velocity (Vo) and absolute power that were
35% (P < 0.01) and 58% (P < 0.01) higher, respectively,
when compared with the untreated group (Figure 4A,
4B). These statistical comparisons accounted for the fact
that several fibres from the same animal were included
in the analysis. Intriguingly, differences between groups
became not significant when force and absolute power
were adjusted for fibre size (specific force, ST) and fibre
length (normalized power), respectively (Figure 4D, 4E).
Collectively, these results demonstrate that treatment with
XJB has no effect on the muscle fiber size but improves
single fibre contractile properties in aged skeletal muscle.

XJB prevents oxidative damage to proteins in
skeletal muscle
Next, we determined whether XJB reduces protein
carbonylation, as a marker of oxidative damage, in skeletal
muscle of aged rats. Muscle homogenate and mitochondria
isolated from gastrocnemius were used for analysis of
carbonyl levels. Carbonyl levels in the muscle homogenate
and mitochondria of aged animals increased by 17% (P
< 0.05) and 31% (P < 0.01), respectively, compared to
adult (6-months old) rats (Figure 5A, 5B). As expected,
aging led to more oxidative damage to mitochondrial
than homogenate proteins. Treatment with XJB reduced
protein oxidation in both fractions. These data suggest
that improvements observed with contractile properties of
gastrocnemius may be associated with reduced oxidative
stress in aged skeletal muscle.

Results
Mitochondria-targeted ROS scavenging does not
affect gravimetric parameters in aged rats
Analysis of gravimetric parameters showed that
XJB treatment did not affect the body weight (BW) of
aged rats that demonstrated a slight but equal (~8%)
decrease in untreated and treated groups by the end of
the treatment period (Figure 2A). Equally, plantaris and
gastrocnemius weights were not affected by XJB, although
soleus weight was increased by 14.9% (P < 0.05) in the
XJB-treated group (Figure 2B). Consequently, the muscleto-body weight ratio remained unchanged for plantaris and
gastrocnemius but was a 10.3% (P < 0.05) lower for the
soleus muscle in the treated group (Figure 2C-2E). No
animal died during the treatment. These findings indicate
that, in general, treatment of aged rats with XJB has
minimal effect on BW and skeletal muscle weights.

contractility are associated with increased activity
of ETC complexes
Furthermore, we determined the activity of ETC
complexes in mitochondria isolated from all three
muscles. We revealed no differences between XJBtreated and untreated adults rats on the activity of ETC
complexes and citrate synthase (Figure 6A-6D). In old
rats, XJB exerted diverse effects on different muscles
for ETC complexes I, III, and IV. Complex I activity

scavenger specifically targeting mitochondria may delay
sarcopenia and improve contractility in skeletal muscle.
Several lines of evidence in both experimental
and clinical studies have supported a central role of
mtROS in aging, and the mitochondrial free radical
theory emphasises the importance of developing new
pharmacological compounds that would specifically
accumulate in mitochondria and target mtROS to attenuate
aging (Reviewed in [26-28]). Targeted overexpression of
catalase in mitochondria resulted in a significant lifespan
extension in mice that provided a direct evidence for
the role of mtROS in longevity [14, 15]. We found that
XJB preserved mitochondrial function (ETC activity)
that was associated with improved contractility in single
muscle fibres of old rats. Our data are also consistent with
previous studies showing that treatment of accelerated
aging Ercc1(-/Î”) mice with XJB attenuated agerelated intervertebral disc degeneration and improved
intervertebral disc cell metabolism [29].
Several studies have revealed a causal link between
enhanced mitochondrial function and improved muscle
contractility. The flavanol (-)-epicatechin, a component of
dark chocolate, increased expression of ETC complexes
and mitochondrial biogenesis that was associated with
significantly enhanced fatigue resistance in isolated
skeletal muscles and improved treadmill performance in
young mice [30]. Likewise, high mitochondrial biogenesis
and cytochrome c expression induced by administration
of quercetin was associated with significantly improved
exercise capacity in young mice [31]. We have previously
reported [25] a direct mtROS scavenging effect of XJB
in cultured H9c2 cells that are used widely as an in vitro
cellular model for both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Pretreatment of these cells with XJB was associated with
preserved mitochondrial membrane potential and increased

70% (P < 0.05) and 44% (P < 0.05) higher in soleus,
gastrocnemius and plantaris, respectively, compared with
mitochondria from untreated old rats (Figure 6C). Notably,
there were no differences in citrate synthase activity
between treated and untreated groups for all three muscles,
indicating that mitochondrial mass was not affected by
the ROS scavenger (Figure 6D). Also, analysis of ETC
supercomplexes in gastrocnemius mitochondria revealed
a 25% (P < 0.01) decrease in aged rats compared with
adult counterparts. However, there were no differences
between XJB-treated and untreated aged rats (Figure 7A,
7B). Likewise, XJB had no effect on protein levels of
superoxide dismutase (SOD2), a mitochondrial isoform
of SOD (Figure 8). These data are consistent with our
previuos findings (20) and demonstrate that the antioxidant
effects of XJB occur through its capacity to scavenge
electrons leaking from uncoordinated electron carriers
rather than the SOD-like activity. Altogether, these data
demonstrate that XJB treatment improves ETC complex
activity without an effect on mitochondrial mass and ETC
supercomplex levels in aged skeletal muscles.

Discussion
The present study provides new evidence that in vivo
treatment of old rats with the recently developed potent
mitochondria-targeted antioxidant XJB: i) improves some
contractile properties of single skeletal muscle fibres, ii)
increases the activity of ETC complexes in skeletal muscle
mitochondria, and iii) has no detrimental effect on the
muscle-to-body weight ratio and single fibre size. These
data provide strong experimental evidence that mtROS
play a causal role in aging-related muscle weakness, and
that the treatment of aged animals with a ROS/electron

cell survival and significantly reduced mtROS induced by
hydrogen peroxide, DMNQ (ROS inducer) and antimycin
A (complex III inhibitor). Interestingly, unchanged citrate
synthase activities in treated and untreated animals
suggested that the improvements in mitochondrial function
with XJB were not simply due to increased mitochondrial
mass (Figure 6D). These observations are consistent with
previous studies that investigated anti-aging effects of a
mitochondria-targeted peptide with mtROS scavenging
capacity, SS-31. Age-related declines in mitochondrial
ATP production, coupling of oxidative phosphorylation
(P/O), and cell energy state (PCr/ATP) were rapidly
reversed after SS-31 treatment with no effect on
mitochondrial content as evidenced by unchanged protein
expression of ETC complexes in old mice [16]. Notably,
like SS-31, uptake of XJB into mitochondria is very high
(up to 600-fold versus the cytosolic fraction) and largely
independent of the mitochondrial membrane potential [20,
32]. In addition, accumulation of the scavenger does not
affect the mitochondrial membrane potential in cardiac
myocytes [25].
The anti-aging effects of XJB and maintenance of
skeletal muscle contractility presumably occur due to
improved mitochondrial ATP synthesis and energy transfer
in the ETC. This preserved ETC activity due to XJBinduced reduction of mtROS may abolish mtDNA damage.
Mitochondrial biogenesis and function is regulated by the
network of transcription factors that control nuclear and
mitochondrial genes encoding mitochondrial proteins

[33]. MtDNA encodes 13 of the approximately 80
proteins involved in ETC complexes and mtDNA damage
induced by mtROS overproduction alters mitochondrial
gene expression leading to defective protein synthesis.
Therefore, scavenging of mtROS may improve the
ETC activity presumably through prevention of mtDNA
damage in aged hearts. In support of this mechanistic
hypothesis, previous studies revealed the ability of XJB
to attenuate oxidative DNA damage in a mouse model of
Huntingtonâ€™s disease [21]. Notably, prevention of mtDNA
may be one of the pathways that mediate beneficial
effects of XJB. Along with the conservation of mtDNA,
prevention of protein (i.e. myosin) oxidation (Figure 5)
may play a critical role in the anti-aging effects of XJB.
This could contribute to the preservation of muscle fiber
contractility. In addition, XJB interacts closely with
cardiolipin, a unique mitochondria-specific phospholipid,
and very efficiently prevents its oxidation [20, 24].
Cardiolipin plays an essential role in the assembly and
stabilization of ETC supercomplexes. Aging reduced
the protein level of supercomplexes in skeletal muscle
(Figure 7), and these findings are consistent with previous
studies [34]. However, XJB treatment had no effect
on the supercomplex levels in aged skeletal muscle.
These data indicate that the beneficial effects of XJB on
ETC complexes are not mediated through assembling
supercomplexes, at least, in gastrocnemius. Further
studies are required to clarify the effect of XJB on ETC
supercomplexes in different skeletal muscles as well

as mitochondrial subpopulations (subsarcolemmal and
interfibrillar mitochondria) .
In conclusion, our findings provide strong evidence
that reductions in mtROS emission by XJB improve the
mitochondrial ETC activity and contractility in aged
skeletal muscles. These protective effects might be due
to increased ATP production, and decreased oxidation of
proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Development of a new
generation of ROS scavengers that primarily target mtROS
has a clinical significance for the treatment of age-related
diseases, and for delaying the degenerative processes
closely associated with aging. The beneficial effects
observed with XJB in attenuating the muscle weakness in
aged rats indicate the potential importance of this ROS and
electron scavenger as a new therapeutic agent.

animals were sacrificed, and skeletal muscles were
isolated, weighed, and used for analysis of contractile
properties and isolation of mitochondria.

Single fibre extraction and permeabilization
The gastrocnemius muscle was dissected from
rats and placed in iced relaxing solution (in mM; 4 MgATP, 1 free Mg2+ , 20 imidazole, 7 EGTA, 14.5 creatine
phosphate, and sufficient KCl to adjust the ionic strength
to 180). The pH was adjusted to 7.0. The muscles
were separated into bundles of fibres and chemically
skinned for 24 h in skinning solution (relaxing solution
containing 50% (v/v) glycerol) at 4 Â°C. The chemically
skinned bundles were stored at Â­20 Â°C up to 4 weeks until
experimental analysis or treated for long-term storage at
Â­80 Â°C using sucrose, a cryoprotectant.

Limitations of the study
One of the limitations is that the studies were
conducted only in male rats. Gender differences in
muscle contractility and mitochondrial function could
play a significant role in the effect of XJB. In addition,
our study involves the treatment of aged rats with XJB
for one month, which might be insufficient to exert more
remarkable effects on the mitochondrial function and
skeletal muscle contractility. High sensitivity of muscle
fibers to low-temperature freezing did not allow the
analysis of the muscle contractility in all groups.

Analysis of single fibre dimensions
Single fibre dimensions were determined as
previously described [35]. Briefly, the skinned fibre
bundles were placed in relaxing Brij solution containing
0.5% Brij-58 (polyoxyethylene 20 cetyl ether; SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 4 Â°C. Then, the
bundles were transferred to relaxing solution for the
isolation of single fibres. Each fibre was transferred to
an experimental apparatus (1400A Permeabilized Fiber
Test System, Aurora Scientific Inc., Ontario, Canada)
and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope
(Olympus IX71, Tokyo, Japan). The fibre was attached
between connectors leading to a force transducer (Model
403A, Aurora Scientific Inc., ON, Canada) and a directcurrent torque motor (Model 315C, Aurora Scientific, ON,
Canada). Immediately, the fibre segment was submerged in
relaxing solution at 15 Â°C to proceed with morphological
measurements. The sarcomere length (set to 2.75-2.85 Âµm)
and the fibreâ€™s diameter, depth, and length were measured
using the Video Sarcomere Length Image Analysis System
(Aurora Scientific Inc., ON, Canada). Fibre cross-sectional
area (CSA) was calculated using width and depth of the
fibre, assuming an elliptical circumference and corrected
for the 20% swelling that follows skinning [36, 37].

materials and Methods
Animals
Male adult (5-month old, n = 17) and aged
(29-month old, n = 19) Fischer Brown Norway (F344/
BN) rats were purchased from Charles River (NIA NIH
colony at Charles River, Kingston, NY). All experiments
were performed according to the protocol approved by the
University Animal Care and Use Committee and conform
to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH
Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).

Experimental protocols

Determination of contractile properties in single
fibres

Animals were randomly assigned to the following
four groups: adult (A), adult+XJB (AX), aged (O),
and aged+XJB (OX). XJB was dissolved in 0.5 mL of
sunflower seed oil (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and
administered intraperitoneally 3 times per week (3 mg/kg
body weight) for four weeks. Rats in untreated groups (A
and O) were injected an equal volume of sunflower oil
(vehicle) without XJB. The body weights of the animals
were measured weekly. After four weeks of treatment,

The contractile properties of single fibers were
determined with the slack test procedure [38, 39].
Maximal unloaded shortening velocity (V0) was measured
as the change in length of the fibre vs. change in time.
Briefly, after 15 sec in a relaxing solution, the fibre was
transferred to a low Ca2+-EGTA solution for another 15
sec to reach steady tension and to preserve the regularity

of cross-striations. Then, the fibre was submerged in an
activating solution (relaxing solution with 10-4.5 M Ca2+).
Once the maximum force (plateau) was reached, a slack
(shortening step) was imposed to drop the force rapidly
to zero. The time required for the fibre to develop tension
again from the imposed slack was measured. The fibre
was relaxed and slowly re-extended to its original length.
This procedure was repeated with different amplitudes of
slacks (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15% of the total fibre segment
length). After the procedure was completed, each fibre was
stored in a sample buffer containing 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH
6.8, 15% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 0.5% bromophenol blue,
10 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 ÂµM leupeptin at -80 Â°C until
the electrophoretic analysis was performed.
For each fibre, the relationship between the time
required for force re-development and the slack length
was plotted using least-squares regression. The slope
corresponds to the V0 of the fibre. Maximum active
force (P0) was calculated as the difference between the
total tension in activating solution (pCa 4.5) and the
resting tension measured in the same segment while in
relaxing solution. The specific force was calculated as P0
normalized to CSA. Absolute power was calculated as the
product of velocity and force and normalized power as
absolute power normalized to CSA.

analysis to completely destroy mitochondrial membranes
and provide access of substrate to ETC complexes.
All assays were performed at the Thermo Scientific
GENESYSâ„¢ 10S UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 30 oC as
previously described [41].
Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) activity
The activity of complex I was determined by
measuring the decrease in the concentration of NADH at
340 nm [42]. The assay was performed in buffer solution
containing 5â€‰mM KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 5â€‰mM MgCl2, 0.24â€‰mM
CoQ1, 0.5â€‰mM KCN, 1â€‰mg/mL BSA, and 2.5â€‰Î¼g/mL
antimycin A. The reaction was initiated by the addition of
20 Î¼M NADH. The enzyme activity was measured for 3
min, and complex I activity was determined by calculating
the slope of the reaction in the presence or absence of
2â€‰Î¼g/mL rotenone (complex I inhibitor). The activity of
complex I was expressed as nmol oxidized NADH/min
per mg protein.
Complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase)
activity
The activity of complex III was determined in buffer
solution containing 5â€‰mM KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 5â€‰mM MgCl2,
0.24â€‰mM CoQ1, 0.5â€‰mM KCN, 1â€‰mg/mL BSA, 2â€‰Î¼g/mL
rotenone, and 0.12â€‰mM cytochrome c (oxidized form). The
reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.02â€‰mM NADH.
The activity of ubiquinol: cytochrome c reductase was
measured as the rate of reduction of cytochrome c at 550
nm with 580 nm as the reference wavelength. The activity
of complex III was expressed in nmol reduced cytochrome
c/min per mg protein.

Isolation of mitochondria
Mitochondria were isolated from all 3 skeletal
muscles using minor modifications of the method
described previously [40]. Briefly, muscles were removed
immediately after sacrifice and rinsed in ice-cold saline
solution. Then they were finely minced into small pieces
and incubated in the solution containing 10 mM EDTA
and 0.05% trypsin for 15 min. Then the minced muscle
samples were centrifuged at 800 g for 2 min, and the
pellet was homogenized in (1:5 wt/vol) ice-cold isolation
buffer containing 300 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10
mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and 0.5% BSA using a
Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at
2,000 g for 2 min at 4 oC. The supernatant was centrifuged
at 10,000 g for 5 min, and the resultant pellet was washed
one more time at 10,000 g for 5 min in the isolation buffer
containing no BSA. The final mitochondrial pellet was
resuspended in the buffer and used for analysis of protein
expression and enzyme activities. All procedures were
performed at 4 oC.

Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activity
The activity of complex IV was determined by
measuring the oxidation of cytochrome c at 550 nm in a
buffer solution containing 50â€‰mM KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 60
mM KCl, 2â€‰Î¼g/mL rotenone, and 0.03â€‰mM cytochrome c
previously reduced with dithiothreitol. The reaction was
initiated by the addition of reduced cytochrome c and
monitoring the slope in the presence or absence of 0.20
mM KCN (complex IV inhibitor). The activity of complex
IV was expressed as nmol oxidized cytochrome c/min per
mg protein.
Citrate synthase activity
The activity of citrate synthase was determined
spectrophotometrically by measuring coenzyme A

Analysis of SOD2, and ETC supercomplexes

Mitochondrial samples were freeze-thawed three
times and incubated in hypertonic media (25 mM KH2PO4,
5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/mL BSA) supplemented with 0.55
mg/mL saponin for 30 min at 4 oC before use in enzyme

Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The chemiluminescence
signals were visualized at the VersaDoc 3000 Gel
Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Mitochondrial
ETC supercomplexes were analyzed by blue native gel
electrophoresis as previously described [34]. Briefly, 60
Î¼g of mitochondrial proteins were dissolved with 50 Î¼L
of solubilization buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazoleHCl, 2 mM 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mM EDTA)
supplemented with 2 Î¼L of 20% digitonin, 0.5 Î¼L protease
and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), and 12.5 U of Benzonase. Samples were
incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged for 20
min at 20,000 g. Supernatants were collected and mixed
with 15 Î¼L of sample buffer (50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol,
0.001% Ponceau S, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). Blue native
gel electrophoresis was conducted as the manufacturerâ€™s
recommendations (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the
gels were stained by Coomassie brilliant blue G 250, then
scanned with the Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging System
(LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The resulting images
were analyzed with ImageJ (NIH).

Protein carbonylation assay

This study was supported by the Puerto Rico
Science and Technology Trust Grant (to WF), the NHLBI
NIH Grant SC1HL118669 (to SJ), and, in part, by the
RCMI National Center for Research Resources NIH Grant
G12RR-003051, and the University of Pittsburgh Aging
Institute Grant 0046549 (to PW).

Protein carbonyls were analyzed as described
previously [25]. Briefly, samples of homogenate and
mitochondria isolated from the gastrocnemius muscle
were derivatized with dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) under acid denaturing
conditions. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotted with anti-dinitrophenyl primary
antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 1:1000
dilution. In order to correct for non-specific binding of
antibodies, separate acid-denatured but no DNPH-treated
protein samples were run in parallel. Carbonyl levels
were determined in scanned blots as the sum of all band
intensities for each lane after subtraction of non-specific
background signals.

Statistical analysis
The statistical software STATA version 12.0
(STATA Corp, College Station, TX) was used to perform
the statistical analysis. Differences between treated and
untreated groups were determined by 2-tailed Studentâ€™s
t-test. Also, a linear mixed regression model was employed
to examine differences in single fibre properties between
treated and untreated groups. Mixed linear models allow
the evaluation of the correlation between multiple fibres
per each specimen analysed (random effects component
of the model). This model assumes that each specimen has
its own mean measurement (normal distribution between
specimens) and each measurement for each subject of
interest is normally distributed around the mean value.
Data are presented as meansÂ±SEM. Differences were
