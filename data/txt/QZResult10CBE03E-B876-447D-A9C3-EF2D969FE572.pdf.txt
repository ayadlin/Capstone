Abstract:

Melanoma remains as the deadliest form of skin cancer with limited and inefficient
treatment options available for patients with metastatic disease. Within the last
decade, the thrombin receptor, Protease Activated Receptor-1, has been described as
an essential gene involved in the progression of human melanoma. PAR-1 is known to
activate adhesive, invasive and angiogenic factors to promote melanoma metastasis.
It is overexpressed not only in metastatic melanoma cell lines but is also highly
expressed in metastatic lesions as compared to primary nevi and normal skin. Recently,
PAR-1 has been described to regulate the gap junction protein Connexin 43 and the
tumor suppressor gene Maspin to promote the metastatic melanoma phenotype.
Herein, we review the role of PAR-1 in the progression of melanoma as well as utilizing
PAR-1-regulated genes as potential therapeutic targets for melanoma treatment.

Melanoma of the skin

melanoma despite response rates of only 15-20% [5,
6]. Furthermore, the duration of the response to DTIC
is not sustained, often lasting as brief as 5 months, with
only 5% of patients showing a complete response [7, 8].
Clinical studies utilizing adjuvant immunotherapies with
interferon α for high-risk stages II and III melanoma, as
well as treatment with high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 for
stage IV melanoma, showed limited response rates of less
than 15% [9-12]. Identification of melanoma oncogenes,
tumor suppressor genes and information gathered from
microarrays have advanced our understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of melanoma [6]. Further studies
in these areas will allow for a clearer understanding of
the process of melanoma progression that might lead to
the development of urgently needed clinical therapies for
metastatic melanoma.
Our laboratory has been studying novel targets
involved in the progression of melanoma to develop
better therapeutic targets for metastatic melanoma. One of
these genes that plays a key role in the progression from
non-metastatic to metastatic melanoma is the thrombin
receptor, Protease Activated Receptor-1 (PAR-1).

In the United States, more than 68,000 new cases
of melanoma were estimated to be diagnosed in 2010,
continuing the trend of increased melanoma incidence
seen over the past 40 years [1]. Melanoma is the fifth
most commonly diagnosed type of cancer in men and
seventh most common in women [1]. The lifetime risk of
an American developing invasive melanoma is 1 in 55 as
compared to 1 in 1,500 in the 1930s [2, 3]. More than 80%
of melanomas are diagnosed at an early clinical stage
(before regional metastasis) with more than 95% 5-year
survival rates for patient’s with localized melanoma [2,
4]. However, when melanoma has spread to regional
lymph nodes or metastasized to other organs, there is
a significant decrease in survival. The 5-year survival
rate for melanoma patients with distant metastasis is
significantly decreased to 15% [2]. Therefore, it is
imperative to determine the molecular events that lead to
melanoma metastasis in search for possible therapeutic
molecular targets to curtail the disease.
Early stage melanoma is easily treatable and
highly curable with surgical resection [5]. However,
once melanoma has metastasized, there are limited and
ineffective treatment options available for patients [5,
6]. Decarbazine (DTIC) is the only FDA-approved
chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic

PAR-1 has been found to be involved in the

This highly acidic region, termed the hirudin-like binding
site, is similar to the amino acid sequence of the leech
anticoagulant peptide, hirudin [27]. This region increases
the affinity and potency of thrombin for PAR-1 [27]. PAR1 also contains a thrombin cleavage site between Arginine
at position 41 and Serine at position 42 in the PAR-1
sequence. Thrombin proteolytically cleaves the PAR-1
N-terminus in an irreversible manner, thereby forming a
new amino terminus with Serine 42 acting as a tethered
ligand to activate the receptor [23, 28] (Figure 1)
Once activated, PAR-1 signals through the activated
G-protein subtypes, Gαq, Gαi, Gα12,13, and Gβγ
resulting in downstream activation of several signal
transduction pathways, such as the phosphoinositide-3
(PI-3) kinase, the mitogen-activated protein (MAPK)
kinase, Rho kinases, as well as increases intracellular Ca2+
and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) [29] (Figure
1). PAR-1 is primarily involved in mediating the effects
of thrombin, which is recognized as a potent mitogen
in cancer and tumor metastasis through sustained ERK
1/2 activation [30]. Protease-Activated Receptors can
also signal in response to proteases that stem from the

progression of several cancers including breast [13,
14], colon [15, 16] prostate [17, 18] and melanoma [1922]. As such, PAR-1 has significant roles not only in
coagulation, wound healing and inflammation, but also in
the progression of several cancer types. PAR-1 was first
identified by Vu et al. in 1991 [23] and remains the most
studied and best characterized protease-activated receptor.
The thrombin receptor belongs to a family of seven
transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors with a unique
method of activation. Unlike typical ligand-binding
interactions that occur with other types of G-protein
receptors, PAR-1 activation occurs through proteolytic
cleavage of the N-terminal domain of the receptor by
serine proteases. Although thrombin is the most effective
and potent activator of PAR-1, activation can occur
through other ligands, such as coagulation factor Xa,
trypsin, granzyme A and plasmin [24, 25]. PAR-1 can
also be proteolytically cleaved and activated by matrix
metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) in breast cancer cells [26].
PAR-1 activation by thrombin involves the anion-binding
exosite of thrombin binding to the PAR-1 amino terminus
in an acidic region spanning amino acids 51 to 63 [23].

Figure 1: Activation and signaling of PAR-1. Thrombin, the most potent activator of PAR-1, binds to the hirudin-like binding domain on

the N-terminus of the receptor and proteolytically cleaves between Arg 41 and Ser 42 in an irreversible manner. Ser 42 now acts as a tethered
ligand to activate PAR-1. PAR-1 signals through G-protein subtypes, Gαq, Gαi, and Gβγ to activate PKC and MAPK, inhibit adenylyl cyclase
as well as activate PI3-K and PKB.

overlapping SP-1 and AP-2α transcription factor binding
motifs within the proximal 3’ region, thereby suggesting
that these transcription factors mediate PAR-1 promoter
activity [42]. Utilizing ChIP analysis, Tellez et al.
demonstrated that AP-2α is bound to the PAR-1 promoter
in low and non-metastatic melanoma cell lines while SP-1
is bound to PAR-1 in metastatic melanoma cell lines [21].
Furthermore, it was seen that AP-2α and SP-1 bind in a
mutually exclusive manner in one of the overlapping
binding regions [21]. Thus, in melanoma, the low levels
of AP-2α enable SP-1 to bind to its motif in the PAR-1
promoter, which results in PAR-1 gene activation. Nonmetastatic melanoma cells express AP-2α. In these cells,
the PAR-1 promoter is bound by the AP-2α transcription
factor thereby suppressing PAR-1 gene expression [21].

tumor and the tumor microenvironments such as MMP1 [26]. Activation of PAR-1 by thrombin also results
in overexpression and secretion of pro-angiogenic and
invasive factors such as IL-8, VEGF, PDGF2 and MMP-2
[31].

PAR-1 in melanoma
Thrombin generation occurs through multiple
pathways including the activation of coagulation factors
often seen in several cancer types, thereby leading to
PAR-1 signaling [31]. In melanoma, as well as in other
cancers, tissue factor (TF), an initiator of the coagulation
cascade, has been found to be upregulated [32]. This
results in expression of thrombin by activation of the
coagulation factor X through expression of tissue factor
[32]. Furthermore, several studies have also demonstrated
that TF is constitutively expressed in melanoma cells
and can activate thrombin in a coagulation-independent
manner, thereby promoting melanoma metastasis through
PAR-1 activation [33, 34]. Moreover, thrombin activation
results in the cleavage of fibrinogen into fibrin. These
fibrin deposits are located in the tumor microenvironment
and store active thrombin that is released upon degradation
of fibrin by plasmin [31, 35, 36].
In an experimental murine lung metastasis model of
melanoma, B16F10 murine melanoma cells transfected
with the PAR-1 gene resulted in a 40-fold increase in
pulmonary metastasis, thus demonstrating that PAR-1 was
the rate-limiting factor in thrombin-enhanced pulmonary
metastasis [37]. Conversely, when B16F10 cells were
treated with a specific thrombin inhibitor, cell migration
was suppressed and in vivo metastasis was decreased [38].
PAR-1 has also been found to be overexpressed in
human metastatic melanoma cell lines as compared to
non-metastatic cell lines [21]. Furthermore overexpression
of PAR-1 is predominantly seen in malignant melanoma
tumor specimens and in metastatic lesions as compared
to benign nevi and normal skin by immunohistochemistry
[20]. Utilizing an automated quantification laser scanning
cytometer on a tissue microarray platform, our laboratory
has also found a significantly higher percentage of PAR-1
positive cells in metastatic melanoma as compared to both
dysplastic nevi and primary melanomas [22].

In vivo effects of silencing PAR-1
Recently, utilizing lentiviral based shRNA, we
stably silenced PAR-1 by more than 80% in two human
metastatic melanoma cell lines, A375SM and C8161
(high expressors of PAR-1), and injected these cells
subcutaneously (to assess tumor growth) and intravenously
(to assess experimental lung metastasis formation). We
found significant decreases in tumor growth of PAR-1silenced melanoma cells as compared to cells transduced
with a non-targeting (NT) control shRNA. Moreover,
significant inhibition of experimental lung metastasis
formation was detected in PAR-1-silenced cells [43].
Although significant differences were seen in vivo,
the use of a lentiviral delivery system as a therapeutic
modality for the delivery of shRNA in melanoma or
other cancers brings about several problems including
the possibility of viral integration into an area where offtarget gene expression can be affected thereby leading to
the development of diseases or cancer. Furthermore, the
shuttling system that moves the shRNA from the nucleus
into the cytoplasm for processing and gene silencing has
the potential to be overwhelmed, such that exportin-5,
involved in shRNA and miRNA shuttling, might be
overloaded and fail to export essential miRNAs or other
factors needed for normal cell functioning [44]. Moreover,
for shRNA to be processed, Dicer must be present in cells.
Merritt et al. found that Dicer expression was variable
among ovarian cancer specimens and further demonstrate
that low-Dicer expressing cells failed to significantly
silence target genes when utilizing shRNA [45]. For
effective use of lentiviral based shRNA, the consistent
expression of Dicer must be present for gene silencing to
occur.
Thus, the use of viruses as a delivery tool for
clinical therapies has several adverse effects including
toxicities, overwhelming nuclear export mechanisms, as
well as unwanted and unpredictable genetic alterations
after viral integration [46, 47]. In recent years, much
research has gone into finding not only effective but also

Transcriptional regulation of
PAR-1 in melanoma
The transition from the radial growth phase to
the vertical growth phase in the progression of human
melanoma is associated with the loss of the transcription
factor Activator Protein-2α [39-41]. Loss of AP-2α
correlates with a concomitant increases in PAR-1
expression [21].

safer alternative technologies to deliver siRNA to tumors
including nano-liposomes [47, 48].
Liposomes are lipid vesicles that allow for the
entrapment of not only siRNA but also various types of
drugs or small molecules. By incorporating siRNAs into
liposomes, they are protected from degradation and thus,
the half-life and potency of the siRNA is increased [49].
Within the last 5 years, the use of siRNA packaged into
neutral 1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(DOPC) liposomes have been utilized effectively in vivo
against EphA2 and FAK to treat ovarian cancer [50, 51]
as well as neuropilin 2 for the treatment of colorectal
carcinoma [52]. These studies demonstrated effective
silencing of target genes with limited toxicities utilizing
low-dose siRNA-DOPC delivered via intraperitoneal
injections [48, 50]. The liposomes were found to rapidly
enter the liver, spleen, kidney and reticuloendothelial
system (RES) along with the target tissue [47].
Nevertheless, the target genes were silenced in vivo,
demonstrating the effectiveness of this delivery system
as a potential therapeutic modality in cancer and other
diseases.
Although we showed that metastatic melanoma cell
lines transduced with lentiviral-based PAR-1 shRNA lost
their potential in forming melanoma tumors and metastatic
lung colonies, the goal of most melanoma research is now
aimed at developing therapies from the benchside to the
clinic. Because of this, we wanted to use siRNA-DOPC
nano-liposomes as an alternative delivery system that is
safer and more feasible, yet effective.
Similar to the results obtained using lentiviral
based silencing of PAR-1, we saw a significant decrease
in melanoma tumor growth and experimental lung
metastasis in melanoma tumor-bearing mice treated with
PAR siRNA-DOPC as compared to NT siRNA-DOPCtreated mice [43]. Moreover, Tumors from PAR-1 siRNADOPC and NT siRNA-DOPC-treated mice were analyzed
for invasive and angiogenic factors including MMP-2,
IL-8 and VEGF. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed
a decrease in these angiogenic and invasive factors after
PAR-1 silencing. Furthermore, through CD31 staining,
we observed a decrease in the number of blood vessels in
PAR-1-silenced tumors as compared to NT siRNA-DOPC
treated mice. In contrast, blood vessels were largely
dilated in NT siRNA-DOPC tumors.
It is important to note that the PAR-1 siRNA
entrapped in the DOPC liposomes is not targeted
specifically to the tumor cells. Our experiments however,
utilized a PAR-1 sequence specific for human PAR-1
that would not recognize murine PAR-1. Furthermore,
PAR-1 is not expressed on mouse platelets and plays
no role in platelet aggregation. Although this was
beneficial for our experimental design, it did not allow
us to determine possible side effects of systemic delivery
of PAR-1 siRNA in terms of platelet aggregation or
coagulation. Nevertheless, the use of PAR-1 siRNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

might still offer a plausible therapeutic target as PAR-1
does not interfere with thrombin generating fibrin (which
subsequently forms a clot) nor does it interfere with other
mechanisms that activate platelets, such as coming into
contact with collagen from damaged blood vessels [53].
Furthermore, platelets can be activated by PAR-4 at higher
concentrations of thrombin [29]. Therefore, a decrease in
PAR-1 might not have such severe effects on coagulation
as compared with other antithrombotic agents [53]. This
could be corroborated by silencing the human PAR-1
equivalent in mice, PAR-3, with systemically delivered
siRNA-DOPC in vivo.
Nevertheless, we sought to elucidate novel
downstream target genes of PAR-1 that might not only
increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which
PAR-1 affects melanoma growth and metastasis, but
might also be targeted by siRNA-DOPC therapies.

Regulation of Connexin 43 by PAR1
To identify downstream target genes of PAR-1 that
might contribute to the metastatic phenotype of melanoma,
our laboratory performed cDNA microarray studies. This
strategy led us to identify Connexin 43 (Cx-43) as a target
gene of PAR-1 [54].
Intracellular membrane channels called connexins
not only allow for the passage of molecules less than
1.2 kD to pass between adjacent cells but have also
been described to function as membrane proteins with
adhesive properties [55, 56]. The attachment of tumor
cells in transition from a primary site to a secondary
organ site requires the attachment as well as the migration
of tumor cells through the vascular endothelium. This
communication between tumor cells and endothelial cells
has been shown to be mediated by connexins and are
critical to tumor cell extravasation at the metastatic site
[57-59].
Increased Cx-43 expression has been observed in
several cancers, including breast cancer [60] and gliomas
[55]. In fact, decreased Cx-43 expression reduced adhesion
of breast cancer cells to the pulmonary endothelium. [61].
In melanoma, increased coupling of Cx-43-expressing
murine melanoma cells to vascular endothelial cells was
previously reported [57]. However, the mechanism by
which Connexin 43 was regulated had not been described.
Utilizing our stably transduced PAR-1 shRNA cells,
we found a significant decrease in Cx-43 expression after
PAR-1 silencing as a result of decreased binding of SP-1
and AP-1 to the Connexin 43 promoter [54]. Moreover, we
found that silencing PAR-1 results in decreased binding
of metastatic melanoma cell lines to human vascular
endothelial cells and to human dermal microvascular
endothelial cells. Upon re-expressing PAR-1 in PAR-1silenced cell lines, an increase in attachment was observed.
To corroborate that the changes in attachment were due
11

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 8 - 17

to Connexin 43, we stably silenced Cx-43 in metastatic
melanoma cell lines and found decreased attachment of
melanoma cells to endothelial cells. This was the first
report of PAR-1 regulating Cx-43 expression adding an
alternative mechanism to how PAR-1 contributes to the
metastatic melanoma phenotype [54].
However, the role of Connexin 43 in melanoma
remains controversial. In contrast, to our findings, Cx43 had previously been found to be decreased in human
melanoma cells [62, 63]. These studies focused on the
early events involved in melanoma progression in which
melanocytes come into contact with keratinocytes via Cx43 and Cx-26. They further showed that melanoma cells
having low Connexin levels were less able to attach to
keratinocytes thereby losing their regulation. These studies
did not utilize melanoma cells that had developed the
capability of metastasizing and in route to the metastatic
site. Once melanoma cells are in the circulation, some
acquire the capability of arresting and extravasating
through the vascular endothelium of the metastatic site.
Connexin 43 is crucial for the communication between
endothelial cells and tumor cells and plays a role in tumor
cell adherence and diapedesis [54, 64].

PAR-1 regulates the
tumor suppressor gene

One of the other genes identified in our cDNA
microarray following PAR-1 silencing was Maspin.
Maspin was increased by more than 45-fold as compared
to NT shRNA transduced melanoma cells [65]. Maspin is
a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family
first isolated from human mammary epithelial cells [66].
Inhibitory serpins bind proteases to its functional domain,
the reactive site loop (RSL). The RSL then undergoes
cleavage by the protease which causes a conformational
change (a stressed to relaxed conformation) in the serine
protease inhibitor [67, 68]. The relaxed-state serpin
complex inactivates the protease [67].
Maspin was first identified as an inhibitor of tissuetype plasminogen activator [69] and urokinase-type
plasminogen activator (uPA) [70, 71]. However, other
studies have shown that Maspin does not have a direct
serine protease inhibitor function, as its functional domain,
the reactive site loop, does not undergo a stressed to relax
conformational change essential for protease inhibition
by serpins [67, 72]. Recently, Denk et al., proposed that
in malignant melanoma, Maspin does function as an
inhibitory serpin as it blocks matrix-degrading proteases
[73].
Maspin expression has been found to be decreased
or lost in several malignancies and is associated with
decreased aggressiveness in prostate cancer and breast

Maspin

Figure 2: PAR-1 regulates Maspin expression in melanoma. Silencing PAR-1 results in decreased activation of p38 MAPK, a known
inhibitor of CBP/p300. This results in higher levels of CBP/p300 HAT activity allowing for increased binding of c-Jun and Ets-1 transcription
factors to the Maspin promoter. Increased Maspin expression further inhibits cell invasion, through decreased expression and activity of MMP2, as well as angiogenesis through decreased VEGF expression.

cancer [74, 75]. Mammary cancer cells that were
transfected with Maspin resulted in decreased tumor
growth and metastasis in vivo [76].
On the contrary, Maspin has been found to be
overexpressed in several cancers, including bladder [77],
lung [78], and pancreatic [79] cancers. Furthermore, in
ovarian cancer and colon carcinoma, overexpression
of Maspin correlates with nuclear translocation [73,
80, 81]. As such, Maspin also seems to have a role as a
transcriptional regulator by increasing expression of tumor
supportive genes [73, 80]. The nuclear Maspin found
in ovarian cancer seems to inhibit the tumor suppressor
cytoplasmic functions of Maspin [73, 81]. Thus, the role
of Maspin in cancer seems to be tumor type specific and
depends on its intracellular localization.
Maspin was recently found to be a tumor suppressor
in melanoma. Metastatic melanoma cells were found to
have decreased expression levels of Maspin as compared to
normal human epidermal melanocytes [73]. Furthermore,
this study found that when Maspin was re-expressed in
melanoma cells, there was a significant reduction in their
invasive capacity.
The mechanism of Maspin regulation, however, has
not been described for melanoma. It has been hypothesized
that the loss of Maspin in metastatic melanoma tumor
specimens might be attributed to an increase in p53, as there
is evidence showing overexpression of p53 in metastatic
melanoma specimens [82-84]. Furthermore, in several
cancers such as breast and prostate cancers, an inverse
correlation between p53 and Maspin expression has been
suggested [85, 86]. However, Webber and colleagues
found no correlation between p53 and Maspin expression
when analyzing metastatic melanoma specimens. Thus,
the mechanism for Maspin regulation in melanoma has
yet to be elucidated [84].
Our laboratory recently published our findings on
PAR-1 regulation of the Maspin tumor suppressor gene
in melanoma [65]. We found an inverse correlation
between PAR-1 and Maspin expression. Highly metastatic
melanoma cell lines have high PAR-1 expression and low
Maspin levels. Likewise, silencing PAR-1 via lentiviral
shRNA, results in increased Maspin expression levels
through increased binding of two transcription factors
known to regulate Maspin, c-Jun and Ets-1. Interestingly,
we did not see a difference in protein expression of c-Jun
and Ets-1 after PAR-1 silencing. Rather, we found that
silencing PAR-1 inhibits phospho- p38 MAPK which
releases the inhibition of the histone acetlytransferase
CBP/p300. The increased HAT activity allows for
increased binding of Ets-1 and c-Jun to the Maspin
promoter and subsequently increased Maspin expression.
Our studies further found that the increased in Maspin
expression results in a decrease in invasion by inhibiting
MMP-2 expression and activity (Figure 2). In vivo studies
utilizing Maspin expression vectors showed a significant
decrease in melanoma tumor growth and experimental
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lung metastasis as well as decreased MMP-2, VEGF, and
Maspin expression levels from tumor sections. To further
corroborate that PAR-1 was regulating Maspin expression
in vivo, we stably silenced Maspin in PAR-1-silenced cell
lines and showed that levels of melanoma tumor growth
and experimental lung metastasis were similar to NonTargeting shRNA-transduced control cells. Furthermore,
levels of Maspin, VEGF and MMP-2 were also increased
to levels similar to NT-transduced cells [65].

Clinical implications
Identifying PAR-1 and its downstream target genes,
Connexin 43 and Maspin, as factors involved in melanoma
progression is essential, as current therapies for metastatic
melanoma are not efficient. The only FDA approved
chemotherapeutic agent is Decarbazine even with dismal
response rates of 15% [5, 6]. Furthermore, the duration of
the response to DTIC is not sustained, often lasting as brief
as 5 months [5, 7, 8]. Adjuvant therapies with interferon
α or IL-2 for high stage melanoma patients also have
limited response rate of less than 20% [9-12] . Our studies
suggest that targeting PAR-1 can potentially be used as a
target for human melanoma therapy. Furthermore, PAR-1
regulates multiple genes essential for melanoma growth
and metastasis such as Connexin 43 which could also
potentially serve as novel targets for melanoma therapies.
Nevertheless using a single target for therapy has not had
success in melanoma. Combining PAR-1 targeted therapy
with chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic drugs, pro-apoptotic
drugs, or even HDAC inhibitors could potentiate the
anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects seen in our PAR1 studies. Finding the right combination of therapies to
effectively treat metastatic melanoma remains one of
the biggest challenges in melanoma research, especially
in melanoma cells that do not harbor the BRAF V600E
mutation.
Although our studies focus on the effects of PAR-1
on melanoma progression, several other cancers such as
breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic cancers have been
found to have increased PAR-1 expression with increased
progression of disease. As such, targeting PAR-1 in these
cancers could also have therapeutic potential.
Taken together our studies show that PAR-1 plays
a major role in melanoma progression and that targeting
PAR-1 or its downstream target genes could help in
treating metastatic melanoma and could have potential
benefits in treating several other cancer types as well.
