ABSTRACT:

Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) is a protein involved in single strand break
repair. Recently, PARP inhibitors have shown considerable promise in the treatment
of several cancers, both in monotherapy and in combination with cytotoxic agents.
Synthetic lethal action of PARP inhibitors has been observed in tumors with
mutations in double strand break repair pathways. In addition, PARP inhibition
potentially enhances sensitivity of tumor cells to DNA damaging agents, including
radiotherapy. Aim of this study is to determine the radiosensitizing properties of
the PARP inhibitor Olaparib in childhood medulloblastoma, ependymoma and high
grade glioma (HGG). Increased PARP1 expression was observed in medulloblastoma,
ependymoma and HGG, as compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue. Pediatric high
grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma gene expression profiling revealed
that high PARP1 expression is associated with poor prognosis. Cell growth inhibition
assays with Olaparib resulted in differential sensitivity, with IC50 values ranging from
1.4 to 8.4 µM, irrespective of tumor type and PARP1 protein expression. Sensitization
to radiation was observed in medulloblastoma, ependymoma and HGG cell lines
with subcytotoxic concentrations of Olaparib, which coincided with persistence of
double strand breaks. Combining PARP inhibitors with radiotherapy in clinical
studies in childhood high grade brain tumors may improve therapeutic outcome.
INTRODUCTION

commonly observed high grade childhood brain tumors
are embryonal tumors (WHO grade IV medulloblastoma
and supratentorial PNET), high grade astrocytic tumors
(WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytoma and WHO
grade IV glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) and high
grade ependymal tumors (WHO grade III anaplastic
ependymoma) [1]. Treatment of children diagnosed

Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are
the second most common type of pediatric cancer after
hematologic malignancies. Malignant childhood brain
tumors have an incidence of 3.2 per 100,000 persons,
with a large heterogeneity of classifying diagnoses. Most

with a high grade malignant CNS tumor consists of a
multimodal approach based on surgery, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy. Despite improved treatment strategies and
a higher chance of survival, especially in standard risk
medulloblastoma, mortality is still considerably high in
high risk medulloblastoma, ependymoma and HGG [2-7].
Radiotherapy is an essential part of the treatment
although notorious for induction of late effects, not
only to the developing cortex and deep brain structures,
but also to the posterior fossa, with higher risk when
applied at younger age [8-13]. Radiosensitizers may offer
the opportunity to ameliorate the therapeutic index by
increasing the efficacy of radiotherapy, while reducing
the toxicity and damage to the developing brain. The
therapeutic index can for instance be improved by
targeting specific characteristics of the tumors cells such
as their replication dependency and DNA repair defects. In
particular, inhibitors of DNA repair are potential treatment
options in highly proliferative high grade childhood brain
tumors, arising in largely non-replicative normal tissues
with proficient DNA repair.
Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) enzymes
have an essential role in single strand break (SSB) DNA
repair and currently there are several clinically relevant
PARP inhibitors available. Upon DNA damage, PARP1
is recruited to SSBs and the thereby induced PAR-chains,
allow base-excision repair [14]. Moreover, PARP1 is
involved in delaying the replication fork in homologous
recombination (HR) proficient DNA damaged cells and
in alternative pathways of non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) [15-17]. PARP inhibitors are in particular
synthetically lethal in tumors with clear DNA repair
deficiencies such as BRCA- tumors. However, both in
vitro and mice studies indicate the rationale to combine
PARP inhibitors with DNA damaging agents in many
different tumor types. Recently, PARP inhibitor Olaparib
was shown to increase radiosensitivity of non-small cell
lung cancer in vitro and in vivo, by inhibition of DNA
repair and reduction of hypoxia by increased tumor
perfusion [18]. Moreover, PARP inhibitors are being
investigated in phase I and II clinical trials for multiple
cancers, as chemo- and radiosensitizers [19, 20]
A recent study indicated the high expression of
PARP1 in pediatric brain tumors, showing a significantly
higher PARP1 mRNA and protein expression in highgrade pediatric brain tumors, compared to their low-grade
counterparts [21]. In addition, PARP1 protein expression
was found in medulloblastoma patients including cell
lines [22, 23]. These studies indicate that PARP1 may
be a potential treatment target in these tumors. Therefore
we investigated whether high PARP1 expression is
a biomarker of unfavorable prognosis in high grade
pediatric CNS tumors. Moreover, we studied the rationale
for combining PARP inhibitors with radiotherapy in
patients with high PARP1 expression by determining the
radiosensitizing properties of PARP1 inhibitors in these

MATERIAL AND METHODS
In silico analysis
R2, a microarray analysis and visualization platform,
provided by the Department of Human Genetics of the
Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
(http://r2.amc.nl), was used to obtain an overview of
PARP1 mRNA expression in high grade pediatric brain
tumors. MAS5.0 normalized datasets of childhood
HGG (n=53; GSE19578) [24], medulloblastoma (n=62;
GSE10327) [25] and ependymoma (n=19; GSE13267)
were compared to normal prefrontal cortex (n=44;
GSE13564) [26] and normal cerebellum (n=9; GSE3526)
[27]. Clinical relevance of PARP expression was evaluated
in an independent ependymoma cohort (GSE27287)[28].

Cell lines and cell culture
We used the pediatric brain tumor cell lines Res196
(fossa posterior ependymoma; Dr. Michael S. Bobola,
Seattle Children’s Hospital Research Institute)[29],
SF188 and KNS42 (glioblastoma), UW479 (anaplastic
astrocytoma), D283-med, D556-med (Dr. Darrell Bigner,
Duke University) and UW228-2 (medulloblastoma). Cell
lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM; PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching,
Austria) containing stable glutamine and sodium
pyruvate, supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria) and 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; PerBio Science Nederland B.V.,
Etten-Leur, The Netherlands). D283-med and D556-med
cells were cultured in medium as above, without sodium
pyruvate.

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin embedded 4 μm histological sections
of 20 pediatric ependymomas (WHO grade II/III), 13
HGG (WHO grade III/IV) and a tissue microarray of 92
medulloblastomas were deparaffinized and rehydrated by
washing the slides in a xylene and ethanol series. Sections
were washed in water, endogenous peroxidase activity
was quenched by a 30-minute incubation in 0.3% H2O2 in
methanol, followed by washing in water. Antigen retrieval
was performed with the sections in a 10 mM citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) using a microwave oven. After washing in
water and PBS, sections were incubated overnight at 4°C
with previously validated mouse anti-PARP1 antibody
(#556362; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA),
diluted 1:500 in normal antibody diluent (Immunologic,
985

Duiven, The Netherlands). After thorough washing in
PBS, sections were incubated for 15 minutes with post
antibody blocking for PowerVision plus (Immunologic).
Sections were subsequently rinsed in PBS and incubated
with undiluted PowerVision plus Poly-HRP-anti Ms/Rb/
Rt IgG (Immunologic) for 30 minutes and washed again
in PBS. The antibody-peroxidase complex was detected
by incubating the sections with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine
solution (Envision-DAB, 1:50, DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark) for 10 minutes. The reaction was quenched in
water. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin,
rinsed with ammonium water for color enhancement,
dehydrated through a series of ethanol and xylene, and
coverslipped.

Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) diluted 1:3,000 in PBS
using a reagent dispenser (Multidrop® Combi; Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cells were counted
using the Acumen eX3 laser scanning cytometer (TTP
LabTech LTD, Melbourn, UK). Cell proliferation of in
suspension growing medulloblastoma cell line D283-med
was assessed using T25 culture flasks. Cells were seeded
in 5 ml in T25 culture flasks, in a concentration of 50,000
cells/ml, in duplicate. After 24 hours, cells were treated
with Olaparib (0 – 10 μM dissolved in DMSO). After 96
hours, cells were counted with a CASY® Cell Counter
(Schärfe System, Germany).
To assess radiosensitizition with Olaparib, the cell
proliferation assay using the Acumen eX3 laser scanning
cytometer was used for KNS42 and Res196, and the
CASY® Cell Counter for D283-med. At 24 hours after
plating, Olaparib (0 - 8 μM) was added and cells were
irradiated (0 – 6 Gy) 2 hours later, using a Gammacell
220 Excel (MDS Nordion, Ottowa, Canada). A 7-day
growth curve was distilled from daily counts. Slope of the
exponential growth was calculated per drug concentration,
normalized to non-irradiated controls and plotted against
radiation dose and analyzed using GraphPad Prism
software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
Analysis of inhibitory concentrations was performed
using SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software, Inc. San Jose, CA,
USA). Triplicate experiments were performed for each
cell line.

Western blotting
PARP1 protein expression was analyzed by
Western blotting. Cells were lysed in homemade
RIPA buffer (50mM Tris/HCL pH 7.5; 1% NP-40; 0.5
% Na-deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCL; 0.05 % SDS),
supplemented with 1 mM Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied
Science, Indianaoplis, IN, USA). Samples containing
equal amounts of protein were separated on a 10% SDS–
PAGE gel and blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The membranes were
blocked in TBS-Tween (20mM Tris; 137 mM NaCL
pH 7.6; 0.1% Tween), containing 5% low fat dried milk
and then incubated overnight at 4°C with an 1:3,000
diluted antibody directed against PARP1 (#556362; BD
Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) or with an 1:10,000
diluted antibody directed against β-actin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). After several
washes the membranes were incubated with 1:3,000
diluted HRP-conjugated rabbit-anti mouse IgG (DAKO,
Glostrup, Denmark). Antibody binding was detected using
Amersham ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System
(GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Clonogenic assay
The radiosensitizing effect of PARP inhibition in
Res196 cells was measured using a clonogenic assay.
To assess clonogenic survival, exponentially growing
Res196 cells were trypsinized, plated in triplicate in 6
wells plates at concentrations from 125/250 cells per
well (0 Gy) to 2,000/4,000 cells (6 Gy) and allowed to
attach for 4 hours. Olaparib (pre)treatment and radiation
was applied as in the cell proliferation assay. Cells were
grown for 10 days, fixed with 3.75% paraformaldehyde
and stained with Giemsa stain modified solution (Fluka).
Colonies of more than 50 cells were counted by an
automated reader (Bioreader® 5000i; BIO-SYS, Karben
Germany). This method was validated by a manual cell
count giving comparable results. Plating efficiency
(PE) was calculated by dividing the number of colonies
counted by the number of cells plated. Surviving fractions
(SF) were then calculated by dividing the PE by the PE of
the non-irradiated control per drug concentration.

Cell proliferation assay
A cell proliferation assay was used to measure
Olaparib (AZD2281 - Axon Medchem, Groningen,
The Netherlands) drug sensitivity. Cells were plated at
a concentration of 4,000 cells/ml for KNS42 and 2,000
cells/ml for SF188, UW479, Res196 and UW228-2
in 96-wells cell culture plates (Greiner Bio-One B.V.,
Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands). After 24 hours, cells
were treated with Olaparib (0 – 10 μM dissolved in
DMSO). After 96 hours, plates were washed with PBS
using a cell washer (AquaMax®4000, MDS Analytical
Technologies Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and fixed with
4% formaldehyde (VWR International SAS, Fontenaysous-Bois, France). After washing with PBS, cells were
incubated for 30 minutes with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich,

minutes, blocked with 5% FBS in PBS for 10 minutes
and washed. Incubation with primary antibody antiγH2AX (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) diluted 1:100
in PBS-gelatin was performed overnight at 4°C. Cells
were washed four times and incubated with fluoresceinconjugated secondary antibody goat-anti-mouse antibody
(1:200; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Cells were rinsed
thoroughly with PBS, treated for 5 minutes with DAPI
diluted in PBS (1:10,000). Fluorescence was visualized
with a Zeiss Axioskip microscope (HBO100W/Z),
equipped with a Canon digital camera (Canon PowerShot
A640, Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan) as well as imaging
software (Canon Utilities, ZoomBrowser Ex. 5.7, Canon
Inc., Nort Ryde, Australia). The number of γH2AX foci
was counted manually.

using the life status (dead vs alive) or the event of relapse
(presence vs absence of relapse) as the outcome variable,
respectively. Impact of high PARP1 expression on overall
survival (OS) was determined using Kaplan Meier analysis
and differences between groups were calculated using the
log-rank test. Statistical tests were performed using SPSS
software (version 15) and 2-sided calculated p values
<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
PARP1 mRNA expression is relatively high in
pediatric brain tumors compared to normal brain
tissue

Statistics

PARP1 mRNA expression in pediatric brain tumors
and non-malignant brain tissues was determined by in
silico analysis of publicly available microarray data[2427], using R2 analysis software. PARP1 was found to
be expressed in normal adult brain. Similar expressions
were found for adolescent dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
consisting of neuronal and glial cells and non malignant
cerebellum. The PARP1 expression was significantly
higher in pediatric ependymoma and medulloblastoma,
compared to cortex and cerebellum, while PARP1
expression in HGG was significantly higher compared to
normal cortex. (Figure 1).

Survival data were available from pediatric
medulloblastoma, ependymoma and HGG gene
expression datasets[24, 25, 28], enabling the correlation
between PARP1 expression and outcome. For HGG,
cases that were a result of previous cranial radiation were
excluded. The quantitative variable PARP1 expression was
dichotomized according to the best cutoff value obtained
by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis

For 55 medulloblastoma, 74 ependymoma and 38
pediatric HGG cases both microarray expression data and
specific outcome data were available[24, 25, 28]. In order
to determine the impact of PARP1 on survival, PARP1
expression data were dichotomized on high versus low
expression for each tumor type.
In the medulloblastoma dataset, in the PARPhigh
group (n = 35) 15 patients died (42.9%) while in the
PARP1low group (n = 20) 5 patients died (25%). KaplanMeier survival analysis showed a trend to worse overall
survival in patients with high PARP1 mRNA expression
(n=28) (p=0.073). In the ependymoma dataset, in the
PARPhigh group (n = 9) 4 patients died (44.4%) while in
the PARP1low group (n = 65) 14 patients died (21.5%).
Again a trend was observed in the Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis to worse overall survival in patients with high
PARP1 mRNA expression (p=0.073). For pediatric HGG
an even stonger association with PARP expression was
observed. In the PARPhigh group (n = 22) 21 patients died
(95.9%) while in the PARP1low group (n = 16) 11 patients
died (68.7%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a

(Figure 2).

a strong to intensive nuclear staining was seen in at least
50% of cells. In tissue sections derived from ependymoma
patients a similar tendency towards strong and abundant
nuclear PARP1 staining was observed: in 16 out of 18
sections a convincing nuclear PARP1 staining was found
in at least 30% of tumor cells. In medulloblastoma a more
varied staining pattern was found, with a higher number
of sections showing moderate nuclear PARP1 staining.
Despite a larger variation in the percentage of positive cell
nuclei, a majority of sections demonstrated positive nuclear
PARP1 staining (61 out of 84 sections). Analogous to the
mRNA expression, ependymoma samples show overall
very high protein expression. Medulloblastoma and HGG
are more variable but overall also highly express PARP1.

PARP1 protein expression in primary tumor
samples
PARP1 protein expression was determined by
immunohistochemistry in non-malignant brain tissues
and pediatric CNS tumors (Figure 3). Non-malignant
cerebellum showed cytoplasmic staining of Purkinje cells
and weak staining of cerebellar neurons; granule cells were
completely negative for PARP1. In normal neo-cortex
only oligodendrocytes showed a strong positive nuclear
staining for PARP1. Astrocytes and neurons had a weak
PARP1 expression. The pediatric CNS tumors revealed
a relatively strong PARP1 protein expression. Within
tumor tissue sections from pediatric HGG, ependymoma
and medulloblastoma patients, a comparable strong
nuclear staining pattern was observed, which was scored
semi-quantitatively based on intensity and percentage
of positive cells. Results of this scoring system are
summarized in table 1. In 7 out of 8 HGG tissue sections

Pediatric brain tumor cell lines are differentially
sensitive to PARP inhibition with Olaparib.
We examined PARP1 protein expression in different
pediatric brain tumor cell lines by Western Blot analysis
(Figure 4). D283-med and UW228-2 medulloblastoma
cells, Res196 ependymoma cells and SF188, KNS42
and UW479 HGG cells were used. In all cell lines

PARP1 protein expression was detected, in particular in
ependymoma cell line Res196 and medulloblastoma cell
line D283-med (Figure 3).
To determine the effect of PARP inhibition on
cell proliferation we first exposed the cells to the PARP
inhibitor Olaparib as a single agent. In figure 5 the effect
of Olaparib treatment on six pediatric brain tumor cell
lines is shown. The HGG cell line SF188 showed high
sensitivity to Olaparib treatment as compared to the other
cell lines, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of
1.42 μM. The medulloblastoma cell line D283-med is
also highly sensitive, with an IC50 value of 2.25 μM. HGG
cell lines KNS42 and UW479 are less sensitive, with IC50
values of 6.74 μM and 7.43 μM respectively. A comparable
sensitivity was observed in the medulloblastoma cell
line UW228-2 for which an IC50 of 6.80 μM was found.
Olaparib appeared to convey minimal toxicity in the
Medulloblastoma

ependymoma cell line Res196, with an IC50 value of 8.42

PARP inhibition with olaparib sensitizes pediatric
brain tumor cells to radiation
To investigate whether a two hour pretreatment
with Olaparib enhances radiosensitivity in ependymoma,
HGG and medulloblastoma cell lines, clonogenic and cell
proliferation assays were performed. Only ependymoma
cell line Res196 was able to form clones in a clonogenic
assay. Using this assay, Olaparib increased radiation
sensitivity compared to the untreated control in a dosedependent fashion (p < 0.001) (Figure 6A). In the absence
of irradiation, clonogenic capacity was reduced with 12%,
18% and 40% in cells treated with 1, 4 and 8 μM Olaparib,

PARP1 expression in pediatric brain tumors compared to
non-malignant brain. Interestingly, high PARP1 mRNA
expression was associated with poor disease outcome
in a gene expression datasets of medulloblastoma,
posterior fossa ependymoma and pediatric HGG, with
high significance in the latter. As a validation of the gene
expression data, we assessed PARP1 protein expression
by immunohistochemistry in high grade pediatric brain
tumors and tissues derived from non-malignant pediatric
brain. Although subtypes of cells in non-neoplastic brain
region showed some PARP1 positivity, an abundant and
profusely intensive nuclear PARP1 staining was observed
in tissues of pediatric brain tumors, especially HGG and
ependymoma. Medulloblastoma tissue was more variable
in PARP1 expression but compared to normal tissue it also
generally showed strongly positive staining.
In all pediatric brain tumor cell lines used in this
study, strong PARP1 protein expression was demonstrated
by Western Blot.
The HGG cell line SF188, which showed a moderate
PARP1 expression had a high sensitivity to Olaparib.
Compared to the other, relatively resistant, HGG cell
lines KNS42 and UW479 this intrinsic sensitivity to
Olaparib was remarkable. It may be explained by the fact
that the SF188 cell line has a focal deletion of the tumor
suppressor gene NF1 (17q11.2) [31]. Inactivating NF1
deletions or mutations have recently been shown in 23%
of adult glioblastoma patient samples and 6% of pediatric
HGG [24, 32]. Impairment of NF1 tumor suppressor
gene function leads to Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK and Ras/
PI3K/AKT/PKB/mTOR pathway overexpression, thus
affecting cell proliferation, growth and survival [33, 34].
Disturbances in these pathways indirectly impair DNA
repair, which possibly explains the high sensitivity of
SF188 to Olaparib [35]. Furthermore, in the study by
Bax et al., a point mutation in TP53 (17p13) was found
in this cell line, impairing apoptosis and hampering G1
arrest [31]. Although Bax et al showed the HGG cell line
KNS42 to harbor the same p53 mutation, KNS42 revealed
a much lower sensitivity to Olaparib. The genetic profile
of SF188 and its high sensitivity to Olaparib found in our
study, suggests a cooperative effect of PARP inhibition on
one side and loss of NF1 and TP53 on the other, leading
to synthetic lethality. Xenograft studies have shown
that NF1 inactivation in mutationally p53 inactivated
mice induced malignant astrocytomas and secondary
malignant tumors after radiation [36, 37]. Future research
is warranted to determine if loss of NF1 indeed conveys
specific sensitivity to PARP inhibition.
Defects in DSB repair in pediatric brain tumors,
providing rationale of synthetic lethality with PARP1
inhibition are to be explored. Recently, low-level gains in
PARP1 were identified in a subset of patients suffering
from diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), using a
whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
– based microarray. Multiple deletions or LOH in genes

respectively (data not shown). Radiosensitizing capacity
of Olaparib was also investigated in Res196 cells by a
previously described cell proliferation assay[30](Figure
6B). Like in the clonogenic assay, radiosensitization was
observed in this assay: upon Olaparib treatment, a dosedependent decrease of exponential growth after radiation
was observed in Res196 cells (Olaparib IC50 8.42 μM,
Figure 5), even in subcytoxic concentrations of 1, 2 and
4 μM.
Since the HGG cell line KNS42 and medulloblastoma
cell line D283-med were not able to form clones, the cell
proliferation assay was used in these cells. Results from
the proliferation assay are shown in figure 6B. In HGG cell
line KNS42 an even more profound effect was observed
when cells were irradiated in the presence of Olaparib,
indicating a stronger sensitizing effect towards radiation.
Based on the toxicity data of Olaparib (Figure 5), showing
an IC50 of 6.74 μM, treatment with 1 and 4 μM Olaparib
showed the optimal radiation sensitizing effect in KNS42.
In medulloblastoma cell line D283-med, showing
relatively strong sensitivity to Olaparib, with an IC50
of 2.25 μM doses of 0.5 μM to 4 μM were used in
combination with radiation. Again radiosensitization was
observed, even in subcytotoxic concentrations of 0.5 μM
(Figure 5B).

Pretreatment with Olaparib results in persistence
of DNA damage after irradiation of pediatric
brain tumor cells.
In order to study the effect of PARP1 inhibition on
the induction and persistence of DSBs in ependymoma,
HGG and medulloblastoma cells, the presence of γH2AX
foci was assessed by immunofluorescence. In HGG
cell line KNS42, ependymoma cell line Res196 and
medulloblastoma cell line D283-med, a rapid formation of
γH2AX foci was observed minutes after ionizing radiation
(Figure 7). A two hour pretreatment with 1 μM (D283med), or 4 μM (KNS42, Res196) Olaparib did not result in
a significant difference of baseline DSB levels compared
to untreated cells before radiation. However, one hour
after irradiation a significantly higher number of DSBs
was observed in Olaparib pretreated cell line Res196 and
D283-med, a difference that persisted even up to 72 hours
after radiation (Figure 7B). Cell line KNS42 showed an
increasing difference in DSB later in time, with γH2AX
foci count still rising at 72 hours after irradiation in cells
pretreated with Olaparib.

DISCUSSION
Here we show that PARP1 is expressed in high grade
pediatric brain tumors, thereby indicating the rationale of
PARP1 as a potential therapeutic target in these cancers. In
silico analysis of PARP1 mRNA expression revealed higher

involved in HR, such as BRCA1/2, RAD50, RAD51L1,
and in NHEJ, such as LIG4, XRCC4 and XRCC5,
were observed in this SNP-array, making exploration
of PARP inhibition in these tumors even more relevant.
Furthermore, in DIPG, phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN) loss was observed in 8-57% in small case series
[38-40]. Loss of PTEN through deletion or mutation in
supratentorial pediatric HGG is more rare than in DIPG,
but if present, associated with poor overall survival [41].
As a transcriptional regulator of RAD51, PTEN is involved
in DSB repair and preservation of chromosomal integrity.
Lack of PTEN function compromises homologous
recombination through decreased expression of RAD51.
In this respect, PTEN loss is described to be an indicator
of PARP inhibitor sensitivity [42-45].
As in the HGG cell line SF188, an almost similar
degree of sensitivity to treatment with Olaparib as a single
agent was seen in the medulloblastoma cell line D283med. Recently, a number of studies were conducted to
gain more knowledge on distinct gene expression profiles
of medulloblastoma, thereby improving the molecular
classification of these tumors [25, 46-48]. Our data
indicate that PARP1 inhibition is a potential treatment
target for high-risk patients and this will be even more
relevant in combination with radiation. In this study
a significant radiation sensitizing effect of treatment
with the PARP1 inhibitor Olaparib was demonstrated in
medulloblastoma, HGG and ependymoma cell lines. For
the evaluation of radiation sensitivity, two distinctive
methods were used. The clonogenic assay is regarded
as the gold standard for the determination of radiation
sensitivity [49]. This method assesses the ability of
neoplastic stem cells for self-renewal and regrowth after
treatment, thought to be the major causes for treatment
failure and tumor recurrence in patients. An alternative
method to the clonogenic assay is the assessment of cell
proliferation after irradiation, providing information on the
proliferative capacities of surviving cells after radiation
[30]. Here we show that Olaparib sensitizes ependymoma
cell line Res196 to irradiation in both assays, supporting
the use of the cell proliferation assay as a method to
study radiation sensitization. This radiosensitizing effect
was also observed in pediatric HGG cell line KNS42
and, to a larger extent, medulloblastoma cell line D283med. Olaparib sensitized these cells in subcytotoxic
concentrations, proving its virtue as a true radiosensitizing
drug.
PARP1 is well known for its prominent role in the
repair of SSBs. Meanwhile, its importance in DSB repair
is gradually emerging [50, 51]. We assessed the effect
of Olaparib on the preservation of DNA damage by
visualizing γH2AX foci. All cells treated with Olaparib
showed persistence of radiation induced DSBs, up to 72
hours after exposure to irradiation, whereas untreated
cells were able to repair most of the damage. Persistence
of DSBs in the Olaparib treated cells can be explained
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by two distinct mechanisms. First, impairment of SSB
repair by PARP1 inhibition and consequent collapse of
the replication fork leads to the formation of DSBs. The
observed accumulation of yH2AX foci in KNS42 cells
might be explained by this phenomenon. Alternatively,
inhibition of PARP1 is suggested to lead to the binding of
Ku to radiation induced DSBs, thereby preventing DSB
repair by HR [52].
Tolerability and efficacy of PARP1 inhibitor Olaparib
in cancer treatment has now been confirmed in adult phase
I and II clinical trials [53, 54]. Since the use of PARP1
inhibitors in cancer treatment is still in an experimental
phase, the long-term effects of PARP1 inhibition have not
yet become apparent. Currently, a clinical trial in the USA
is exploring efficacy of oral PARP inhibitor Veliparib
(ABT-888) in combination with temozolomide in pediatric
patients with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors [19].
Especially in the treatment of childhood cancer, long
term-effects should be taken into serious consideration.
From this perspective it is of importance to get more
insight in PARP1 expression and function in developing,
non-malignant brain tissues. This is necessary to
determine the therapeutic index of PARP1 inhibitors,
especially when used in combination with other DNA
damaging agents. Recently, studies have shown that
inhibition of PARP1 could convey a specific therapeutic
benefit for the central nervous system. Following acute
oxidative stress, such as radiation, neurons are described
to have excessive synthesis of PAR by overactive PARP-1,
leading to NAD+/ATP depletion and subsequent neuronal
cell death. PARP inhibition has therefore been opted as a
neuroprotective strategy for cerebral ischemia and several
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease
and ALS [55, 56].
In conclusion, our study provides evidence that
PARP1 inhibition with Olaparib enhances radiation
sensitivity of pediatric ependymoma, medulloblastoma
and pediatric HGG cells in vitro, thereby providing
the basis for further in vivo studies, aiming at clinical
trials combining PARP inhibitors upfront with (chemo)
radiotherapy. This is a very important finding since some
radiation resistant pediatric brain tumors could profit from
a sensitization drug like Olaparib. This will potentially
lead to more effective therapies with the possibility to
reduce radiotherapy, conveying a better therapeutic index,
ultimately leading to better survival with a reduction of
long term side effects.
