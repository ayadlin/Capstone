Targeting mTOR in Renal
Cell Carcinoma*
Gary R. Hudes, MD

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is clearly an important therapeutic target for advanced renal
cell carcinoma (RCC), although its mechanisms of activation are not completely understood. In first-line
treatment of patients who have both advanced RCC and multiple risk factors for short survival, temsirolimus improves overall survival (OS) compared with interferon. In patients whose tumors have progressed
after sunitinib and/or sorafenib therapy, everolimus improves progression-free survival compared with placebo. Beyond the initial phase 3 studies demonstrating efficacy, many important questions remain in the
clinical application of mTOR inhibition and in developing other inhibitors of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. Important objectives of current and future clinical investigations include a more detailed description of the
molecular pathology of RCC and identification of potential biomarkers that are predictive of tumor sensitivity to PI3K/Akt/mTOR targeted therapies. This information may identify other groups of RCC patients that
are likely to benefit from inhibition of this signaling pathway. Additional questions concern mechanisms by
which tumors become resistant to mTOR inhibitor therapy and how such resistance can be defeated. Possible mechanisms include the loss of feedback inhibition of insulin receptor substate/PI3K signaling resulting
from the inhibition of mTOR complex 1 by rapamycin analogs and the activating phosphorylation of Akt by
mTOR complex 2. Laboratory studies indicate that these resistance mechanisms could be countered
by using other targeted agents in combination with mTOR inhibitors. Cancer 2009; 115(10 suppl):2313–20.

Signaling through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth, metabolism, proliferation, and motility. Genetic alterations of components in this pathway, including mutation of PI3K and the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase and
tensin homolog (PTEN), promote tumorigenesis and are common in human cancers.1,2 The PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway plays important roles in the response of cells to hypoxia and energy depletion, and the
activation of this pathway in malignancy has been linked to the resistance of tumor cells to radiotherapy
and chemotherapy. Consequently, much effort has been devoted to the development agents that inhibit
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. The relevance of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
is highlighted by the recent success in using inhibitors of the downstream component, mTOR, to treat

patients with metastatic disease. These encouraging
results indicate that further success may be achieved with
new inhibitors of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR, now in
development.
mTOR
mTOR is a member of a group of structurally similar protein kinases that includes the ataxia telangiectasia mutated
(ATM), ATM and rad3, and DNA protein kinases.3
Members of this family share a domain structure that
includes FAT (FRAP, ATM, TRAP), FATC (FAT c-terminal), and HEAT (Huntington, EF3, alpha-subunit of
protein phosphatase 2A, TOR1) sequences, the latter of
which mediates protein-protein interaction. This structure underlies the interactions of mTOR with other proteins and its key role as a regulator of cellular
homeostasis.4 A rapamycin binding domain is centrally
located, whereas the kinase domain is located near the carboxyl terminus. Inhibition of mTOR kinase by rapamycin first requires that the drug associate with FKBP12, an
abundant intracellular protein.5 This requirement also
holds for temsirolimus and likely other rapamycin analogs.6 The drug-FKBP12 complex binds mTOR at the
rapamycin binding domain to inhibit kinase function by
an allosteric mechanism. This mechanism confers remarkable selectivity: There are no other known molecular targets of rapamycin and its analogs.
mTOR Activation and Signaling
mTOR integrates a variety of signals that reflect cellular
growth stimuli, nutrient availability, energy status, and
stress. Biochemical studies placed mTOR in the growthfactor–activated PI3K, Akt (protein kinase B) signaling
pathway, downstream from Akt.7 mTOR kinase is also
activated by genetic alterations that reduce the function of
the PTEN tumor suppressor protein8 or increase the function of the catalytic (p110) subunit of PI3K,9 both of which
cause abnormal activation of Akt. A parallel pathway
through which mTOR is activated involves the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (AMP kinase), and the tuberous
sclerosis complex 1 and 2 proteins. This pathway suppresses
mTOR kinase in states of nutrient and energy depletion.
mTOR functions in 2 multiprotein complexes,
TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2
2314

(TORC2).10 TORC2 is implicated in the control of cell
morphology and adhesion through the regulation of protein kinase Ca. TORC2 has also been shown to phosphorylate and activate Akt.11 Through phosphorylation of
2 downstream effectors, p70S6kinase (S6K) and the binding
protein for eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (4E-BP1),
TORC1 controls the translation of cyclin D, c-Myc, and
other key proteins involved in cell proliferation.12
TORC1 also regulates the expression and stability of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1a.13,14 These mTOR functions are relevant to RCC, which is characterized by
alterations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, leading
to the up-regulation of HIF-a subunits, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and other molecules that
increase angiogenesis.15 Loss of VHL function in RCC
also results in deregulation of cyclin D1, a cyclin-dependent kinase cofactor required for cell cycle progression.16,17
Thus, mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of
temsirolimus in RCC probably include inhibition of both
angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. Importantly,
mTOR kinase associated with TORC2 is relatively resistant to inhibition by rapamycin in vitro, suggesting that
temsirolimus and other rapamycin analogs may effectively
inhibit the activities of TORC1, but not TORC2, a
potential mechanism of resistance.18

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway in RCC
Robb and colleagues19 found evidence of mTOR activation as determined immunohistochemically by increased
phospho–mTOR-S6 protein relative to normal renal tissue in approximately 60% of 25 primary clear cell RCC.
By using similar methods, Pantuck and colleagues20
found that activation of the mTOR pathway affects prognosis for patients with localized and metastatic kidney
cancer. In their tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical study, mTOR pathway activation occurred most
significantly in clear cell carcinomas, high-grade tumors,
and tumors with poor prognostic features. Laboratory
investigations indicate that PI3K/Akt activation could be
an important predictor of sensitivity to mTOR inhibitor
therapy in the clinic,8 and the preliminary report of a
small study that correlated phospho–Akt-S6 protein with
tumor response supports this possibility.21 The frequency
of mTOR pathway activation in RCC metastases and

The adverse event (AE) profile of the mTOR inhibitors includes hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, which
reflects the blockade of the main signaling conduit for insulin and IGF. Other common AEs for the class are fatigue, stomatitis, diarrhea, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
rash, and peripheral edema. Less common effects include
renal insufficiency, interstitial pneumonitis, and neutropenia.22-27

how this correlates with activation in the primary tumor
have not yet been reported.

Clinical Trials of mTOR Inhibitors in
Metastatic RCC
Rapamycin and 3 analogs of rapamycin (rapalogs) have
undergone clinical evaluation as cancer therapeutics. The
3 rapamycin derivatives differ from the parent structure at
the C43 position, which is modified to increase solubility
and bioavailability by the addition of an ester, ether, or
phosphonate group for temsirolimus, everolimus
(RAD001), and deferolimus (AP23573), respectively
(Fig. 1). Temsirolimus, the first mTOR inhibitor in cancer clinical trials, was approved in 2007 for patients with
advanced or metastatic RCC. Everolimus (RAD001) was
evaluated in patients with metastatic RCC whose disease
has progressed after treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib.
Deferolimus has not been evaluated in RCC.
Rapamycin and the rapalogs have similar pharmacologic properties. Total clearances increase with dose,
whereas exposures (area under the plasma concentration
vs time curve) increase less than proportionally with
dose.22-26 The terminal plasma half-lives are relatively
long, ranging from 24 hours to 48 hours. For temsirolimus, the ester moiety is hydrolyzed to yield sirolimus,
which has a longer terminal half-life (mean of 12 hours to
15 hours for temsirolimus and 40 hours to 50 hours for
sirolimus). Because temsirolimus and sirolimus bind to
FKBP12 and exert similar antiproliferative effects in
vitro,6 both moieties likely inhibit mTOR after administration of temsirolimus. Little or no metabolism to siroliCancer

Antitumor effects of temsirolimus in patients with RCC
and other tumors were observed during phase 1 evaluation. Two unconfirmed partial responses (PRs) were
observed in 16 patients with RCC enrolled on the 5-day,
every 2-week phase 1 trial of temsirolimus,22 and 1 confirmed PR was seen in the weekly schedule phase 1
study.23 A formal maximal tolerated dose was not defined
for either of these schedules in minimally pretreated
patients, but AEs were more common at higher doses in
each study. The question of optimal dose was further evaluated in a randomized phase 2 study of weekly temsirolimus in patients with cytokine-refractory metastatic
RCC.26 A total of 111 patients were treated with temsirolimus at a weekly dose of 25, 75, or 250 mg. The study
participants had received a median of 2 prior therapies for
metastatic disease, and 91% of them had received prior
interleukin-2 or interferon. The median time to progression was 5.8 months, and the median overall survival
(OS) was 15 months. The objective response rate was only
7%, but 51% of patients had clinical benefit, defined as
either objective response or stable disease for at least
6 months. The lowest dose of temsirolimus (25 mg) seemed
to be as effective as the higher dose, was better tolerated
over multiple cycles, and was selected for subsequent studies. Notably, patients with 3 or more predictors of short
survival according to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic factor model28 had a
median OS of 8.2 months, significantly shorter than the
median OS (approximately 23 months) of patients with
fewer risk factors but longer than would be expected for
patients with multiple adverse prognostic factors treated
with interferon in the first-line setting.29 With these considerations, a larger randomized trial was conducted to

determine whether mTOR inhibition with temsirolimus
could improve the OS of patients with poor prognosis
RCC.

Phase 3 Trial of Temsirolimus, Interferon, or
Temsirolimus Plus Interferon in RCC
The Global Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma trial was
designed to determine whether temsirolimus, as a single
agent or in combination with interferon alfa, improved
the OS of patients with advanced, poor prognosis RCC.30
Several aspects of the Global Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma trial design distinguish it from other contemporary
phase 3 trials in RCC. First, the primary study endpoint
was OS, targeting a 40% improvement in median OS for
each of 2 comparisons, temsirolimus versus interferon and
the combination of temsirolimus and interferon versus
interferon. Second, the study enrolled patients with all
RCC histologic types and did not exclude those with predominantly non–clear-cell tumors. Third, patients were
not required to undergo cytoreductive or adjuvant nephrectomy before enrollment. Finally, the study enrolled
a predominantly poor prognosis population, defined by
requiring patients to have at least 3 of 6 factors known to
be associated with short survival. This prognostic model
used the 5 factors comprising the MSKCC model28 and
added a sixth factor (multiple organ sites of metastases) as
initially described by Mekhail and colleagues.31
A total of 626 patients were randomized to 1 of 3
treatment groups: temsirolimus, 25 mg intravenously
(IV) each week; interferon alfa, 3 million units (MU) subcutaneously (SC) 3 times weekly (escalating to 18 MU SC
3 times weekly or maximum tolerated dose); or a combination of temsirolimus, 15 mg IV weekly, and interferon
alfa, 6 MU SC 3 times weekly. The schedule and doses of
temsirolimus and interferon alfa for the combination
treatment were established in a preceding phase 1-2
study.32
Most patients (80%) had clear cell histologic disease,
and 67% of them had undergone nephrectomy to remove
the primary tumor. Patients with a Karnofsky performance score of 70 or lower comprised 82% of the population. By the MSKCC prognostic model,28 74% of
patients were in the poor prognosis category.
Compared with interferon and combination therapy, fewer patients receiving single-agent temsirolimus
2316

had grade 3 or 4 AEs. Asthenia was more frequent in the
groups receiving interferon, whereas rash, peripheral
edema, and stomatitis affected more patients who received
temsirolimus, whether alone or in the combination treatment. Myelosuppression was more common in patients
treated with the combination of temsirolimus and interferon alfa. Compared with interferon monotherapy, temsirolimus was associated with a higher incidence of
hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia.
The OS was greater for patients who received temsirolimus compared with those receiving interferon (hazard ratio for death, .73; 95% confidence interval [CI],
.58-.92; P ¼ .008). Progression-free survival was also
greater for patients receiving temsirolimus (P<.001). By
contrast, OS for the group receiving combination therapy
was not significantly different from that of the group
treated with interferon, although progression-free survival
was significantly longer for the combination group.
The median survival times for the groups receiving temsirolimus, interferon, and the combination were 10.9
months, 7.3 months, and 8.4 months, respectively. The
objective response rate was not significantly different
for the temsirolimus, interferon, and combination
groups (8.6%, 4.8%, and 8.1%, respectively). Planned
subgroup analysis revealed that the OS advantage for
temsirolimus held for patients with clear cell and non–
clear-cell carcinomas and for those with and without
prior nephrectomy.

Everolimus
Everolimus (RAD001) is an orally administered rapamycin analog that has been developed for weekly or daily
administration. Continuous daily administration of 10
mg was selected for a phase 2 study in patients with metastatic predominantly clear cell RCC and up to 1 prior
therapy. In a preliminary report of this study,33 37 of the
41 patients enrolled were evaluated for response and toxic
effects. The AEs related to everolimus treatment were stomatitis, rash, hypophosphatemia, hypertriglyceridemia,
hyperglycemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pneumonitis—a toxicity profile similar to that of temsirolimus.
Objective PR was observed in 12 patients, and 19 patients
had stable disease for 3 or more months. The median duration of therapy exceeded 8 months, and the median OS
Cancer

Targeting mTOR in RCC/Hudes

exceeded 11.5 months. These results led to a randomized
clinical trial comparing everolimus, 10 mg daily, with placebo for patients with disease progression after sunitinib
or sorafenib therapy. Progression-free survival, the primary study endpoint, was reached at the second interim
analysis. Compared with placebo, treatment with everolimus resulted in a significant improvement in progressionfree survival (hazard ratio, .30; 95% CI, .22-.40;
P < .0001). The median progression-free survivals for the
everolimus and placebo groups were 4 months and 1.9
months, respectively.34 The OS analysis, not yet mature,
will include patients assigned to the placebo who eventually received everolimus at the time of disease
progression.

Combination Studies
Ideally, combination therapies should use effective agents
with differing mechanisms of action and adverse effect
profiles. Accordingly, the possibility of achieving greater
efficacy in metastatic RCC with the combination of an
mTOR inhibitor and a VEGF or VEGFR inhibitor seems
appealing. Preliminary results of a phase 1 study of temsirolimus and bevacizumab have been the most encouraging.
Each agent was delivered at the standard single-agent dose
for multiple cycles, and 8 PRs were observed in 14
patients.35 By contrast, the combination of temsirolimus
with sorafenib, a Raf kinase, and a VEGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, required a 50% reduction of the single-agent
dose of sorafenib. The recommended doses for phase 2
evaluation were sorafenib, 200 mg twice daily, and temsirolimus, 25 mg IV weekly.36 As noted herein, the combination of temsirolimus and interferon was feasible only at
reduced doses of each agent and was not more effective
than single-agent interferon in metastatic RCC.30
Temsirolimus combinations will be further evaluated in E2804, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group randomized phase 2 study of 3 combinations,
including the aforementioned temsirolimus/bevacizumab
and temsirolimus/sorafenib doublets and single-agent
bevacizumab as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic RCC.
Additional combination trials that have commenced
use mTOR inhibitors together with other targeted agents
to more effectively inhibit mTOR and/or block signaling
in multiple pathways. For example, the crosstalk between
Cancer

the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Raf/MEK/Erk pathways
observed in experimental systems37,38 provides a rationale
for combining inhibitors of both pathways, such as an
mTOR inhibitor with a MEK inhibitor, to achieve antitumor effects greater than can be gained from inhibition of a
single pathway.39,40 Another combination strategy draws
on the additive effects of histone deacetylase inhibition
and mTOR inhibition in reducing HIF-a expression and
activity.41,42 Other combinations, such as an mTOR inhibitor with an IGF receptor antagonist, are based on the
possibility of overcoming resistance to mTOR inhibition.

Potential Resistance Mechanisms
and Countermeasures
As discussed herein, TORC2 signals back to Akt, phosphorylating the protein on Ser 473.11 This positive feedback loop may limit the therapeutic effects of the
rapamycin analogs, which mainly inhibit mTOR associated with TORC1. Although earlier in development, catalytic inhibitors of mTOR that inhibit the kinase activity
in both TORC1 and TORC2 should inhibit mTOR kinase more completely than the rapalogs, with the possibility of greater antitumor effects.
A second mechanism of resistance involves inhibition of S6K, a downstream consequence of mTOR
(TORC1) inhibition. Insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2
(IRS-1 and IRS-2) link insulin and IGF 1 (IGF-1) signaling to PI3K and, subsequently, to activation of Akt and
mTOR. S6K phosphorylates IRS-1 and IRS-2, a modification that destabilizes these proteins and uncouples IGF/
insulin signaling to PI3K.43 Thus, mTOR/S6K activation
exerts negative feedback to restrict insulin and IGF-1 signaling. Loss of this negative feedback mechanism has been
shown to occur in cells and tumors exposed to rapamycin,44,45 everolimus,46 and temsirolimus47 and, in certain
contexts, it could limit the antitumor effects of mTOR inhibition with these agents. This specific mechanism of resistance, increased IGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling, may be
overcome by simultaneous inhibition of IGF-1R45-47 or
with inhibitors of PI3K and Akt.
Finally, evidence for a rapamycin-insensitive,
mTOR-independent mechanism of protein translation
that requires PI3K signaling, but not mTOR, S6K, or
phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein, is another
potential barrier to effective therapy with mTOR
2317

inhibitors.48 Depending on the expression of the alternate
pathway in tumor cells, inhibition of TORC1 and its
downstream effectors (S6K, 4E-BP1) may not be sufficient to reduce the translation of HIFs and cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D.
Summary and Future Considerations
Inhibitors of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling have proven activity in advanced RCC. These agents are generally well
tolerated, with fatigue, metabolic abnormalities, stomatitis, diarrhea, and myelosuppression the most common
toxic effects.
How to use mTOR inhibitors most effectively in
RCC and other tumors is an active area of clinical
research. Monotherapy with rapalogs is modestly effective
in metastatic RCC, but this is probably not the optimal
way to block PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling to key downstream effectors that promote cell proliferation and survival. Greater success may be possible with newer
enzymatic inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR, and with combinations that include an mTOR inhibitor with other signaling inhibitors, or with cytotoxic agents. Many of the
studies testing these newer approaches will include correlations of potential tumor biomarkers with treatment outcomes toward the important goal of determining who will
benefit the most from inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the oral presentation given at the Third Cambridge Conference on Innovations and Challenges in Renal Cancer and do not
correspond directly to the written article, which is a more general review.
Discussion after Dr. Gary R. Hudes’ presentation.
Robert Figlin: We have a set of agents that have the
ability to inhibit both HIF and tumor cells, yet the
response rates to both temsirolimus and RAD are modest.
In designing future trials of agents that target this pathway, whether it is upstream or rapalogs, what are the primary aims of the trials?
Dr. Hudes: The more robust activity is tumor
shrinkage, but, clearly, if you can delay tumor progression
2318

a long time, that is promising. However, we need to do
better than 5-month median progression-free survival.
We need to look at progression-free survival as an endpoint with these drugs, but the goal in developing the
combinations is to identify tumor shrinkage.
Dr. Figlin: With the PI3 kinase inhibitors that are
now about to enter phase 2, what do you think is a go/no
go decision based on the response in a cohort of 50
patients?
Dr. Hudes: In a renal cell cancer population?
Dr. Figlin: Yes.
Dr. Hudes: It is going to be tough to use progression-free survival in the current landscape.
Dr. Figlin: What I worry about for these trials is
that we will not be able to determine how to use active
drugs because they will not be robust enough as single
agents.
Dr. Hudes: That is a real challenge of our success.
William Kaelin: I am cautiously optimistic that the
second-generation agents will be more active precisely
because of this phenomenon with the rapalogs, where you
get this paradoxical increase in Akt. Akt is doing some important things in tumor cells with respect to survival, and
we also know that Akt is playing a role in angiogenesis not
only through HIF, but also through FOXO, and the
FOXO seems to be mTOR independent. We may get
pleasantly surprised and see more of a signal with combined inhibition of TORC 1 and TORC 2.
Michael Atkins: We now have RAD001 as a standard in patients whose disease has progressed after VEGFR
TKI therapy. Do you think that it is the standard and do
you think that comparing RAD001 to placebo is a fair
test?
Dr. Hudes: If you go by pure evidence-based
results, you can get this result probably with other TKIs
and temsirolimus. The target and the pharmacology of
the mTOR inhibitors are more similar than those of the
TKIs. If one works, it is likely that the others will too.
Jeffrey Sosman: If you are confused over which of
these drugs to choose, what would be the most important
question to ask in a clinical trial?
Dr. Hudes: First, I would like to turn off the counterregulatory pathway involving insulin receptor substrates and see if you could inhibit the feedback
mechanism that increases Akt activation. Second, would
be to inhibit both TOR complexes.
