SUMMARY

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Amino acid (AA) is a potent mitogen that controls growth and metabolism. Here we describe the
identification of Rab1 as a conserved regulator of AA signaling to mTORC1. AA stimulates
Rab1A GTP-binding and interaction with mTORC1, and Rheb-mTORC1 interaction in the Golgi.
Rab1A overexpression promotes mTORC1 signaling and oncogenic growth in an AA- and
mTORC1-dependent manner. Conversely, Rab1A knockdown selectively attenuates oncogenic
growth of Rab1-overexpressing cancer cells. Moreover, Rab1A is overexpressed in colorectal
cancer (CRC), which is correlated with elevated mTORC1 signaling, tumor invasion, progression
and poor prognosis. Our results demonstrate that Rab1 is a mTORC1 activator and an oncogene,
and that hyperactive AA signaling through Rab1A overexpression drives oncogenesis and renders
cancer cells prone to mTORC1-targeted therapy.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cell growth is a process of assimilating extracellular nutrients into cell mass, which requires
coordinated regulation of nutrient transport and protein synthetic capability. Signaling
modules have evolved to transduce nutrient cues to cellular programs such as transcription
and translation (Dechant and Peter, 2008; Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004; Zaman et al., 2008).
mTOR is a conserved central growth controller in eukaryotes (Loewith and Hall, 2011;
Sengupta et al., 2010). It forms two distinct kinase complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2
(Loewith et al., 2002; Sarbassov et al., 2004). In response to nutrient signals, TORC1
controls cellular growth and metabolic processes and mTORC2 regulates survival through
AKT phosphorylation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Hyperactive mTORC1 signaling is a major cause of diverse human diseases such as cancer
(Tsang et al., 2007). Because mTORC1 is commonly hyper-activated in human tumors, it is
a desirable target for cancer therapy (Bjornsti and Houghton, 2004; Zhang et al., 2011). Two
rapamycin analogs (rapalogs), everolimus and temsirolimus are FDA-approved drugs for
advanced renal and breast carcinomas. However, the overall objective response rate remains
low for rapalogs. Thus, studying the regulation of mTORC1 is of considerable biological
and clinical importance.
AA is not only an essential nutrient but also a potent mitogen: AA rapidly activates
mTORC1. Rag proteins are lysosomal/vacuolar membrane-bound small GTPases. Upon AA
stimulation, Rag GTPases function as heterodimers that bind to and activate TORC1 (Kim et
al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008). In the presence of leucine, leucyl tRNA synthetase binds to
Rags and promotes TORC1 signaling (Han et al., 2012). Rag is well conserved from yeast to
humans (Sekiguchi et al., 2001). The yeast Rag homologs Gtr1 and Gtr2 were recently
shown to also mediate AA signaling to TORC1 (Binda et al., 2009; Bonfils et al., 2012).
Because the importance of AA in cell growth and metabolism, however, Rag proteins are
probably not the only sensors. The goal of the present study is to identify Rag-independent
regulator of AA signaling and investigate the underlying mechanism and significance.

RESULTS
Ypt1 is essential for AA to activate TORC1 in yeast

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Gtr1 and Gtr2, the yeast orthologs of RagA/RagB and RagC/RagD, respectively, function as
a heterodimer to regulate TORC1 (Binda et al., 2009; Bonfils et al., 2012). Consistently,
gtr1Δ and gtr2Δ mutants are hypersensitive to rapamycin (Figure 1A), indicative of their
role in TORC1 signaling (Bertram et al., 1998). However, these mutants exhibit no apparent
growth defect and AA can still fully activate TORC1 in gtr1Δ and gtr2Δ mutants as judged
by phosphorylation of TORC1 substrates Sch9 and Maf1 (Figure 1B) (Wei and Zheng,
2009; Wei and Zheng, 2010). Additionally, the dominant-active Gtr1-GTP or Gtr2-GDP
does not affect TORC1 activity during AA starvation and re-stimulation (Figure 1C). The
yeast vacuole (lysosome) anchors Gtr1 and Gtr2 signaling (Binda et al., 2009; Bonfils et al.,
2012), but the growth and TORC1 signaling remains normal in vacuolar biogenesis mutant
vps16Δ, vps33Δ, pep3Δ and pep5Δ (Figures 1A and 1D). Together, these observations
clearly show that GTR and vacuole are dispensable for AA signaling to TORC1 in yeast.

We previously showed genes in TORC1 pathway display the rapamycin sensitive phenotype
(Bertram et al., 1998). Using this assay, we carried out a genomic screen and identified a
large set of TORC1 signaling genes (Chan et al., 2000). Because most known mTORC1
activators are small GTPases (e.g. Rheb, Rag and Rho1)(Inoki et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2008;
Sancak et al., 2008; Stocker et al., 2003; Tee et al., 2003; Yan et al., 2012; Zhang et al.,
2003), we focused our search for Rag-independent TORC1 activator on small GTPase,
particularly Rab, one of the largest small GTPase subfamilies (Hutagalung and Novick,
2011; Stenmark, 2009). Among the nine non-essential yeast Rab mutants, ypt6Δ and ypt7Δ
are hypersensitive to rapamycin (Figure 1E). With the two essential Rab genes, when
assayed under Tet-off condition (Hughes et al., 2000), Tet-YPT1 but not Tet-SEC4 strain
shows rapamycin hypersensitive phenotype (Figure 1F). The ypt1-ts mutant also displays
rapamycin hypersensitivity (Figure 1G). Thus Ypt1, Ypt6 and Ypt7 are involved in TORC1
signaling. However, depletion of YPT1 (Figure 1H), but not YPT6 and YPT7, blocks the
activation of TORC1 by AA (Figures 1H and 1I), indicating that Ypt1 is essential for AA
signaling. The precise role of Ypt6 and Ypt7 in TORC1 signaling is presently unknown.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Ypt1 is the yeast paralog of Rab1, a highly conserved Golgi membrane-bound GTPase
previously known for ER-to-Golgi vesicular trafficking (Hutagalung and Novick, 2011;
Stenmark, 2009). However, a large number of yeast mutants in ER-Golgi trafficking do not
display any rapamycin sensitive phenotype (Figure S1A), suggesting that the role of Rab1 in
TORC1 signaling is not directly related to its trafficking function. Consistently, Ypt1
interacts with Tor1, which is a TORC1-specific component in yeast, in a GTP- and AAdependent manner (Figure S1B) and AA stimulates GTP-binding by Ypt1 (Figures S1C and
S1D). These results indicate that AA regulates Ypt1 and its GTP-dependent interaction with
TORC1.
AA stimulates Rab1A interaction with mTORC1 in a GTP- and Golgi-dependent manner in
HEK293E cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A recent RNAi screen revealed that dRAB1 knockdown in Drosophila S2 cells strongly
inhibits dS6K phosphorylation (Li et al., 2010), suggesting that Rab1 function in TORC1
signaling is conserved. To further explore this, we knocked down Rab1A in HEK293E cells
with three distinct Rab1A shRNAs, all of which efficiently down-regulate Rab1A
expression and inhibit the phosphorylation of S6K1(T389) but not AKT(S473), indicating
that Rab1A is specifically required for mTORC1 signaling (Figure 2A). Rab1A knockdown
attenuates activation of mTORC1 signaling by AA (Figure 2B), while mTORC1 activation
by insulin persists, albeit the overall mTORC1 signaling is decreased (Figure 2C), which is
similar to that of Rag knockdown (Kim et al., 2008). Thus Rab1A function in AA signaling
is conserved in humans. Of note, Rab1A knockdown does not cause cell death as judged by
lack of PARP cleavage (Figure 2A), which is consistent with the mTORC1-specific function
for Rab1A.
Like in yeast, endogenous Rab1A also interacts with mTORC1 (Figure 2D). HA-Rab1A is
associated with mTOR and Raptor, not Rictor (Figure S2A), and is bound more with MycRaptor than Myc-mTOR (Figures S2B and S2C). Myc-Raptor not Myc-mTOR remains
associated with HA-Rab1A after the immunocomplex is washed with 0.5% TX-100, a

condition known to disrupt mTORC1 (Figure S2D), indicating that Raptor mediates the
binding of Rab1A. Rab1A is a small GTP-binding protein anchored on ER and Golgi
membranes through prenylation (Calero et al., 2003; Gomes et al., 2003). mTOR
preferentially binds to Rab1A-GTP (Rab1A-Q70L, Rab1AGTP)(Pind et al., 1994) compared
with Rab1A-GDP (Rab1A-S25N, Rab1AGDP) (Alvarez et al., 2003), or a Rab1AC202, 203S
mutant (Rab1AC2S) deficient of prenylation and ER/Golgi localization (Calero et al., 2003;
Gomes et al., 2003)(Figure 2E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Upon AA stimulation, there is a significant increase in the GTP-binding activity of Rab1A
(Figures 2F and 2G). Moreover, AA regulates Rab1A interaction with mTORC1 in a GTPdependent manner (Figure 2H). Strikingly, Rab1AGTP binds persistently to mTORC1 and
sustains mTORC1 signaling even under AA starvation (Figures 2H and 2I). In contrast,
serum or insulin does not affect the Rab1A GTP-binding (Figure 2J) or Rab1A-mTORC1
interaction (Figure S2E). These observations indicate that Rab1A mediates AA signaling to
mTORC1, which is a conserved phenomenon. Curiously, AA starvation disrupts the
association of Ypt1GTP with TORC1 in yeast, but not Rab1AGTP with mTORC1 in humans.
This is likely due to the fact that nutrients such as AA plays a more prominent growthregulatory role in single cellular organisms than mammals. The latter is regulated by
nutrients as well as polypeptide factors (e.g. cytokines and hormones). Consistent with this
notion, starvation of HEK293E cells with both serum and AA also blocks the binding of
Rab1AGTP to mTORC1 (data not shown).
Rab1A regulates the formation of Rheb-mTORC1 complex in the Golgi

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

When ectopically expressed, Rab1A stimulates the level of P-S6K1 and P-4EBP1, but not PAKT (Figures S3A and S3B), indicating that Rab1A overexpression specifically promotes
mTORC1 signaling. The ability of Rab1A to enhance mTORC1 signaling is dependent on
Rab1A GTP-binding and association with Golgi/ER membranes because such Rab1AGDP
and Rab1AC202, 203S mutants fail to increase S6K1 phosphorylation (Figures S3A and S3B).
To understand the underlying mechanism, we examined the functional relationship between
Rab1A and two other major mTORC1 activators, Rheb and Rag. Rab1A knockdown
strongly attenuates RagB/RagC-dependent mTORC1 activation by AA (Figure 3A). On the
other hand, while down-regulation of Rheb abolishes Rab1A-dependent mTORC1 activation
by AA, RagA/RagB knockdown only has a partial effect (Figure 3B). Curiously, the
dominant-active RagBGTP/RagCGDP can partially rescue the loss of Rab1A (Figure S3C).
These observations indicate that regulation of mTORC1 by Rab1A is dependent on Rheb,
but Rab1A and Rag are relatively independent of each other with Rab1A has a more
prominent role, which is consistent with the yeast results.
Although Rag GTPases regulate mTORC1 in the lysosomes (Sancak et al., 2010), mTORC1
is widely distributed throughout the cell, including the ER, Golgi, endosomes, mitochondria
and nucleus (Drenan et al., 2004a; Li et al., 2006; Liu and Zheng, 2007; Sancak et al., 2008;
Schieke et al., 2006), suggesting that regulation of mTORC1 signaling is more complex than
currently thought, involving multiple subcellular systems and mechanisms. To locate where
Rab1A engages mTORC1, we used Duolink, which allows the detection of protein-protein
interactions in situ in intact cells and tissues (Soderberg et al., 2006), to analyze in situ

Rab1A-mTORC1 interaction. Antibodies against Rab1A and Raptor or mTOR together, but
not each individually or under the condition that one partner is knocked down, generated a
strong signal in the Golgi (Figures 3C, and S3D–H). Therefore, Rab1A interacts with
mTORC1 specifically in the Golgi, which is consistent with our earlier observation that
Golgi localization is required for Rab1A to bind to and activate mTORC1 (Figures 2E and
S3A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further investigate the mechanism of mTORC1 regulation by Rab1A, we examined the
localization of the Rheb-mTORC1 complex. Rheb-Raptor interaction prominently occurs in
the Golgi as judged by conventional and confocal microscopy (Figures 3D, 3E and S3D).
This result is consistent with the observations that both Rheb and mTORC1 are prominently
localized in this organelle (Figure S3I) (Buerger et al., 2006; Drenan et al., 2004a; Hanker et
al., 2009; Liu and Zheng, 2007). In addition, Rheb interaction with mTORC1 has been
mainly detected in the Golgi in live cells (Yadav et al., 2013). Raptor-Rheb15 is a fusion
protein that tags Raptor with the C-terminal Rheb CAAX signal sequence, which renders
constitutive activation of mTORC1 (Sancak et al., 2010). Because Rheb15 contains the
CAAX motif that is sufficient to target Rheb to the Golgi (Buerger et al., 2006; Hanker et
al., 2009), we investigated Raptor-Rheb15 subcellular localization and found that it is indeed
predominantly found in the Golgi (Figures S3I–K). Moreover, Rab1A knockdown disrupts
mTORC1 localization or Rheb-mTORC1 interaction in the Golgi (Figures 3F, 3G and S3L),
while not affecting mTORC1 localization or interaction with Rag in the lysosomes (Figures
S3M–Q). Hence Rab1A controls mTORC1 signaling by regulating formation of the Golgi
Rheb-mTORC1 complex.
Rab1A is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer (CRC), which is correlated with
hyperactive mTORC1 signaling, tumor invasion and poor prognosis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A previous microarray study revealed that Rab1A is overexpressed in 98% human tongue
squamous carcinomas (Shimada et al., 2005). To ask if Rab1A is also aberrantly expressed
in other malignancies, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of Rab1A in
primary human CRC and adjacent normal tissues. Rab1A staining is much stronger (median
H-score 255) in tumors than the matching normal tissues (median H-score 40) (Figures 4A
and 4B). Rab1A is scored higher in approximately 80% tumors, though the intensity is
markedly variable with IHC scores are 100-fold higher in tumors than normal tissues (Figure
4C).
We next examined the relationship between Rab1A expression and mTORC1 signaling by
staining Rab1A and P-S6K1 in consecutive tissue sections. Overall Rab1A expression is
strongly correlated with P-S6K1 staining (Figures 4D and 4E). In tumors with
heterogeneous Rab1A expression, P-S6K1 level still show striking correlation with Rab1A
level: in tumor nodules where high Rab1A, P-S6K1 staining is also stronger (Figure 4F). We
further examined the relationship between Rab1A staining and different clinicopathologic
parameters and found that high Rab1A-positive staining is statistically significantly
correlated with poor survival (Figure 4G), increased tumor invasion and advanced tumor
stages (Table S1). In addition, high Rab1A-positive staining appears to be associated with
lymph node metastasis but the result is not statistically significant due to limited sample size

(Table S1). Together, these results show that Rab1A is frequently overexpressed in CRC,
and that high Rab1A expression is correlated with hyperactive mTORC1 signaling, tumor
invasion and progression, and poor prognosis.
Rab1A is essential for the oncogenic growth of Rab1A-overexpressing CRC cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In a panel of CRC cell lines, Rab1A expression is also highly variable, ranging from high
(e.g. DLD-1 and CACO2) to low (e.g. RKO and COLO205), but is correlated with P-S6K1
not P-AKT (Figures 5A, S4A and S4B). Thus these cell lines share similar characteristics to
primary tumors and are good models for studying the significance of Rab1A expression.
Surprisingly, P-S6K1 is not correlated with the expression of Rab1B, Rheb, RagA, RagB,
RagC and RagD (Figures S4C–H), suggesting that unlike Rab1A, other known mTORC1
activators are not responsible for the hyperactive mTORC1 signaling in CRC cells. When
Rab1A is knocked down in three pairs of CRC cell lines, DLD-1 and CACO2, KIM12 and
HCT116, RKO and COLO205, representative of high, moderate and low Rab1A-expressing
cells, respectively, mTORC1 signaling is abrogated (Figure 5B). However, there is a striking
inverse correlation between growth inhibition and Rab1A expression: the growth and colony
formation are strongly, moderately and slightly inhibited, respectively, in the three cell pairs
(Figures 5C–5H). Of note, Rab1A knockdown did not affect cell viability as no significant
increase in apoptotic cell death was seen (data not shown), which is consistent with the
results with HEK293E cells (Figure 2A). Furthermore, Rab1A knockdown attenuates
mTORC1 signaling (P-S6K1 staining) and oncogenic growth (Ki67 staining and mitotic
index) of DLD-1 xenograft tumors in nude mice (Figures 5I–K). That Rab1A knockdown
preferentially inhibits CRC cells with high Rab1A suggests that Rab1A overexpression is a
key driver for cancer growth.
Rab1A overexpression rather than activated PI3K or MEK is essential for hyperactive
mTORC1 signaling and oncogenic growth of CRC cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PI3K is thought to be a major upstream regulator of mTOR signaling. DLD1, HCT116 and
RKO each carry a heterozygote activating mutant PIK3CA allele. P-S6K1 level is very low
in RKO (Figure 5A), indicating that activated PI3K is insufficient to promote mTORC1
signaling in RKO cells. However, P-S6K is moderate or high in DLD1 and HCT116 (Figure
5A), presenting an interesting dilemma: is Rab1A or PI3K responsible for the elevated
mTORC1 signaling and oncogenic growth? To address this question, we analyzed isogenic
DLD1 and HCT116 cell lines in which PIK3CAWT or PIK3CAmutant allele is deleted
(Samuels et al., 2005). Deletion of the PIK3CAmutant allele abolishes AKT but not S6K1
phosphorylation (Figures 6A and S5A), which is in contrast to Rab1A knockdown that
abolishes mTORC1 signaling (Figure 6A). Moreover, Rab1A knockdown rather than
PIK3CAmutant deletion attenuates CRC cell growth and colony formation (Figures 6B–E).
This result is consistent with a previous report that the activated PI3K mutant is responsible
for enhanced survival but not growth of CRC cells (Samuels et al., 2005). Ras/MEK/ERK
pathway is another major mitogenic signaling pathway that is frequently mutated in CRC.
However, MEK inhibition had little effect on mTORC1 signaling, cell growth or colony
formation of DLD1 and CACO2 cells that both have Rab1A overexpression and high ERK
signaling (Figure S5B–D). These data show that Rab1A-AA signaling rather than PI3K and

MEK pathway is crucial for the hyperactive mTORC1 signaling and growth of DLD1,
HCT116 and CACO2 cells.

CRC cells with Rab1A overexpression are addictive to AA for growth
Because Rab1A mediates AA signaling to activate mTORC1, we investigated how AA
modulates CRC oncogenic growth by analyzing the effect of AA restriction on three pairs of
CRC cell lines with different Rab1A expression level. There is a striking inverse
relationship between Rab1A expression and cell growth during AA restriction: DLD1 and
CACO2 cells (high Rab1A expression) are much more sensitive to AA restriction than RKO
and COLO205 (low Rab1A expression), while HCT116 and KIM12 (modest Rab1A
expression) are intermediate (Figure 6F). For example, the growth of DLD1 and CACO2
cells is reduced by nearly 50% in culture medium supplied with 75% AA (Figure 6F). In
contrast, that of RKO and COLO205 remains normal. On the other hand, no significant
correlation is seen between Rab1A expression and the sensitivity to serum or glucose
starvation (Figures 6G, 6H and S5E). These observations suggest that CRC cells with
Rab1A overexpression are highly addictive to AA for growth.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Rab1A overexpression promotes oncogenic transformation and malignant growth
To evaluate the pathological consequence of Rab1A overexpression, we ectopically
expressed GFP or GFP-Rab1A in NIH3T3 cells. As observed in HEK293E cells, GFPRab1A stimulates S6K1 phosphorylation compared with GFP (Figure 7A), and the growth
and colony formation of NIH3T3 cells (Figures 7B, 7C and S6A). These cells also form
large foci in confluent culture and exhibit anchorage-independent growth (Figures 7D, 7E
and S6B). In contrast, the H-RasV12 mutant does not significantly affect mTORC1 signaling
or promote oncogenic growth (Figures 7A–E, S6A and S6B). Of note, cells with GFPRab1A display similar oncogenic growth in the absence or presence of H-RasV12, indicating
that Rab1A does not cooperate with H-RasV12 in oncogenic transformation. Compared with
WT Rab1A, Rab1A-GTP further promotes while Rab1A-GDP and Rab1A-C2S reduce cell
growth (Figure S6C), which is consistent with their mTORC1-activating activity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We further evaluated the oncogenic potential of Rab1A in vivo by injecting nude mice with
NIH3T3 cells stably expressing GFP-Rab1A or GFP. Control cells has low propensity to
form tiny tumors in nude mice (6 out of 12) (Figures 7F and 7G), which is consistent with
previously studies (Greig et al., 1985; Rong et al., 1994). In contrast, GFP-Rab1A cells form
large tumors with 100% efficiency (12 out of 12) (Figures 7F and 7G). Histologically, GFPRab1A tumors display elevated S6K1 phosphorylation and malignant phenotypes (e.g. high
cell density, mitotic index and nuclear variability) (Figure 7H). These results indicate that
Rab1A overexpression is sufficient to transform immortalized cells.
RKO is a CRC cell line with low Rab1A expression. GFP-Rab1A overexpression enhances
S6K1 phosphorylation (Figures 7I), promotes RKO cell growth and colony formation
(Figures 7J and 7K), and xenograft tumor growth in nude mice (Figures 7L and 7M). RKO
tumors expressing GFP-Rab1A show elevated P-S6K1 and mitotic index (Figure 7N). Thus,
Rab1A overexpression can also enhance malignant growth of established tumors. To
determine the dependency of Rab1A-mediated transformation on Rheb and Rag GTPases,

we knocked down Rheb or RagA/RagB in RKO cells overexpressing GFP-Rab1A. Downregulation of Rheb and Raptor much more significantly attenuates Rab1A-stimulated
mTORC1 signaling, cell growth and colony formation than knockdown of RagA and RagB
(Figures S6D–F). Thus, Rab1A is primarily dependent on Rheb for stimulation of mTORC1
signaling and oncogenic growth.
Rab1A overexpression promotes mTORC1-dependent oncogenic growth and renders
rapamycin sensitivity in CRC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Successful targeted cancer therapy hinges upon hyper-activation of the target signaling
pathway (Shawver et al., 2002). Cancer cells become dependent on or ‘addicted’ to such
‘growth driver’ pathway, rendering these cells prone to the targeted treatment. We therefore
investigated the relationship between Rab1A overexpression and rapamycin sensitivity.
Indeed, there is a strong correlation between Rab1A expression and growth inhibition in the
panel of CRC cell lines, with the highest rapamycin sensitivity for DLD1 and CACO2, and
the lowest for RKO and COLO205 (Figure 8A). To verify this finding in vivo, we generated
DLD1 and RKO xenograft tumors, representing CRC with high and low Rab1A expression,
respectively. After tumors were established, the animals were treated with rapamycin or a
control vehicle. Rapamycin completely blocks the growth of DLD1 tumors but has no
discernible effect on RKO tumors (Figure 8B), despite of strong on-target inhibition of
mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin (Figure 8C). Moreover, rapamycin abrogates the elevated
mTORC1 signaling, growth and colony formation of NIH3T3 and RKO cells driven by
Rab1A overexpression (Figures 8D and 8E), indicating that the oncogenic growth by Rab1A
overexpression is indeed mediated by mTORC1. Together, these results demonstrate that
Rab1A overexpression drives mTORC1-dependent oncogenic growth and renders drug
sensitivity to mTORC1-targeted therapy in CRC.

DISCUSSIONS

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Rab1 is a small GTPase previously known for its role in vesicle transport from the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi. Here we describe a Rab1 function that mediates AA
signaling to activate mTORC1. Down-regulation of Rab1 inhibits mTORC1 activation by
AA in yeast and humans, indicating that this Rab1 function is well conserved.
Mechanistically, AA stimulates Rab1A GTP-binding and GTP-dependent interaction with
mTORC1 in the Golgi. Rab1 does not directly activate mTORC1 kinase activity (Data not
shown). Instead, it regulates Rheb interaction with mTORC1 in the Golgi. Together, these
observations show that Rab1 uses the Golgi as an anchor to regulate mTORC1 activation by
Rheb in response to AA sufficiency.
Rab1A and Rag both interact with mTORC1 in response to AA sufficiency, and promote the
co-localization of mTORC1 with Rheb. However, they are anchored on two distinct
endomembrane systems, with Rag on the lysosomes and Rab1A on the Golgi. Rab1A
knockdown blocks Rheb-mTORC1 interaction on the Golgi, but not the lysosomes (Figure
8F). Rab1A overexpression rescues the ability of AA to activate mTORC1 in the absence of
RagA/RagB, while overexpression of the hyper-active RagBGTP/RagCGDP complex partially
restores AA activation of mTORC1 when Rab1A is knocked down. In addition, Rab1A
requires Rheb but not Rag to stimulate mTORC1 signaling and oncogenic growth in CRC

cells. These observations suggest that Rab1A and Rag operate as two independent axes of
AA signaling to mTORC1. Interestingly, constitutively activated Rag GTPases in humans
but not in yeast partially rescues mTORC1 activation by AA in the absence of Rab1A,
suggesting that Rag gains a bigger role in AA signaling during evolution. Because AA are
essential for cell growth and metabolism, it makes sense for eukaryotic cells to add
redundant signaling modules, Rab1 and Rag, to transduce AA signals, which ensures
reliable transmission of this crucial mitogenic signal. In addition, it is possible that the two
signaling branches have distinct functions to provide finer control of the signaling process
(e.g. engaging in external versus internal AA signals, or different type of AA).

Small GTPases such as Ras, Rho, Rac and Ral are known for their roles in cancer initiation
and development. Rab proteins constitute one of the largest subfamilies of small GTPases
and are generally regarded as housekeeping proteins involved in intracellular membrane
dynamics. To date, their roles in carcinogenesis remain obscure. Only until recently were
select members of this subfamily (e.g. Rab25) implicated in human cancer (Cheng et al.,
2004). Interestingly, Rab1A was previously reported to be highly overexpressed in human
tongue squamous cell carcinomas (Shimada et al., 2005). Here we report that Rab1A is
overexpressed in CRC. In addition, Rab1A is overexpressed in breast and liver tumors (our
unpublished observations). These results indicate that aberrant Rab1A expression is a
general phenomenon in human malignancies. Although PI3K acts upstream of mTORC1,
surprisingly, activating PI3K mutations in CRC do not promote mTORC1 signaling or
oncogenic growth. Moreover, the expression of several other mTORC1 activators such as
Rheb and Rag is not correlated with mTORC1 activity. These observations suggest that
tumors selectively activate Rab1A-dependent mTORC1 signaling through Rab1A
overexpression to gain oncogenic advantage.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although Rab1A expression was reported to be elevated in tongue cancer, the significance
of Rab1 overexpression remained unclear. Here we show that Rab1A overexpression is
sufficient to transform immortalized fibroblasts and promote malignant growth of
established tumor cells, suggesting that Rab1A is capable of promoting both oncogenic
transformation and growth. Although Rab1A is universally required for TORC1 signaling,
only the CRC cells with high Rab1A expression are strongly dependent on Rab1A for
growth, indicating that Rab1A overexpression is a driver for these CRC cells. Remarkably,
CRC cells with Rab1A overexpression are highly dependent on AA, suggesting that elevated
AA signaling renders cancer cells addictive to AA. AA signaling is increasingly recognized
as a key mitogenic event but its role in cancer remains relative obscure. A recent study
implicated GATOR, the GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Rag A/RagB as potential
tumor suppressor (Bar-Peled et al., 2013). However, genomic mutation of GATOR
components appears to be relatively rare. In contrast, Rab1A overexpression is widespread
in human malignancies, suggesting that aberrant AA signaling as a result of Rab1
overexpression is a common mechanism to promote oncogenic transformation and growth.
mTOR is a major cancer therapeutic target (Bjornsti and Houghton, 2004; Tsang et al.,
2007) with two rapalogs (temsirolimus and everolimus) presently used in the clinic.
Although upstream regulators of mTORC1 such as PI3K and PTEN are commonly mutated
in human tumors, such mutations have not correlated well with clinical responses (Don and

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 November 10.

Zheng, 2011). This is consistent with the observations that PI3K mutant is not responsible
for mTORC1 activation and it promotes survival rather than oncogenic growth in CRC
(Samuels et al., 2005). Our data indicate that Rab1A overexpression is a driver for
mTORC1-dependent growth, which is correlated with CRC sensitivity to rapamycin. Further
research in this area could lead to a predictive biomarker for improving mTORC1-targeted
therapy. In addition to cancer, Rab1A is up-regulated in a dilated cardiomyopathy model,
and heart-specific Rab1A transgenes is sufficient to cause cardiac hypertrophy in a gene
dosage-dependent manner in mice (Wu et al., 2001). It is noteworthy that rapamycin is
effective to regress established cardiac hypertrophy (McMullen et al., 2004). Our findings
herein provide a mechanistic explanation for the pathological role of Rab1A in cancer and
cardiac hypertrophy.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Human Rab1A plasmid was a gift from Dr. Marci A. Scidmore (Rzomp et al., 2003);
Plasmids expressing HA-GST-Rheb1, HA-GST-Rap2A, HA-GST-RagB(Q99L), (RagBGTP)
and RagC(S75L) (RagCGDP)(Sancak et al., 2008) were acquired from AddGene. To
generate Rab1A-GFP and Rab1A-HA, Rab1A cDNAs were subcloned into theEcoRV and
NotI sites of pEGFP-C1, and the SalI and NotI sites of pRK5, respectively. Raptor and
Rictor cDNAs were subcloned into the AscI and MluI sites of pCMV6-AN-Myc. Rab1AGTP
(Q70L), Rab1AGDP (S22N), Rab1AC2S (C202, 203S) were generated by PCR site-directed
mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. GM130-GFP plasmid was generated by cloning
GM130 cDNA into pEGFP-C1.
Immunological reagents, chemicals, cell extracts, Western blot and immunoprecipitation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Immunological reagents were obtained from the following sources (Cat # in parenthesis):
Tor1-specific antibody was previously described (Li et al., 2006). HRP-labeled secondary
antibodies, Santa-Cruz; Antibodies for mTOR (2983), Raptor (2280), Rheb (4935), RagA
(4537), RagB (8150), RagC (5466), RagD (4470), Lamp1 (9091), Rictor, P-S6K1(T398),
S6K1, P-AKT(S473), AKT, P-4E-BP1(T37/46), 4E-BP1, ERK, P-ERK(T202/Y204), αtubulin and Myc-epitope, Cell Signaling Technology; Antibody for HA-epitope, Bethyl
Laboratories; Antibodies for Rab1A and P-S6K1(T398) for IHC, Lamp2 antibody
(ab25630), Abcam; Antibody for Rab1A (11671 for WB and IP), Rab1B, Proteintech
Group; Rab1A antibody for IF (H00005861-M07A), Abnova; Protein G-Sepharose, GE
Healthcare; EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and PhosSTOP, Roche;
rapamycin and PD98059, Selleck Chemicals. Cell lysis and Western blot (Drenan et al.,
2004b; Sancak et al., 2008) and immunoprecipitation (Sancak, et al, 2008) were performed
as described previously. For determining if Ratpor or mTOR mediates the interaction with
Rab1A, anti-Rab1A immunoprecitates were washed with cell lysis buffer containing 0.25%
or 0.50% TX-100.
Xenograft tumors and drug therapy in athymic nude mice
To generate xenograft tumors, a total of 5×106 to 1×107 cells in 100 ml PBS were injected
subcutaneously into 4-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. Tumor volume was measured

using a Vernier caliper and calculated according to the formula: tumor volume (mm3) =
(shorter diameter2 × longer diameter)/2. Tumor volume was measured every other day and is
presented as means ± SD. At the endpoint, mice were sacrificed, and tumors were removed
and photographed. For drug therapy experiments, DLD-1 and RKO cells were injected
subcutaneously into nude mice to establish Xenograft model. After tumors were established,
rapamycin was administered with 5 mg/kg rapamycin dissolved in DMSO and sterile saline
by daily intraperitoneal injections for 10–12 days. Drug vehicle-treated mice received daily
injection of identical solution without rapamycin. At least 6 mice were included in each
treatment group. Animal experiments were approved by Rutgers and Shanghai Jiaotong
University School of Medicine (SJTUSM) Animal Care and Use Committees.
CRC tissue array and immunohistochemistry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

90 pairs of de-identified malignant infiltrating CRC tumors with paired non-cancerous
samples (cutting edge of surgical excision beyond 5 cm from cancer areas) were randomly
obtained from July 2006 to August 2007. The CRC tissue array was prepared by Shanghai
OUTDO Biotech Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Followed up and the survival time was
calculated from the day of operation to the end of the follow-up or the date of death due to
the recurrence and metastasis. This study was carried out according to the provisions of the
Helsinki Declaration of 1975, and was reviewed and approved by SJTUSM Ethics
Committee. The Streptavidin-Biotin Complex (SABC) method was used in
immunohistochemistry to detect Rab1A and P-S6K1(T389). Primary antibodies against
Rab1A and P-S6K1(T389) were used at a concentration of 1:400 and 1:50, respectively. To
score a tumor cell as positive, both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was counted. For the
quantitative analysis, a Histo score (H-score) was calculated based on staining intensity and
percentage of stained cells using the Aperio ScanScope® Systems (Vista, CA, USA). The
intensity score was defined as follows: 0, no appreciable staining in cells; 1, weak staining in
cells comparable to stromal cells; 2, intermediate staining; 3, strong staining. The fraction of
positive cells was scored as 0–100%. The H-score was calculated by multiplying the
intensity score and the fraction score, producing a total range of 0 to 300. A cutoff of 30 was
used for P-S6K1 positivity and 90 for Rab1A positivity. Tissue sections were examined and
scored separately by two independent investigators blinded to the clinicopathological data.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using the SAS 9.13 software. The statistical analysis of
numeration data was done using the Pearson’s Chi-Square test or Fisher’s Exact Chi-Square
test. The comparisons of continuous data between groups were performed using the
Student’s t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank test. Nonparametric Spearman Correlation test
was performed to analyze the correlation between Rab1A and P-S6K1 expression level. For
survival analysis, data collection was locked on August 16, 2011. Kaplan-Meier plots and
Log-rank test were applied to determine the significance of differences in cumulative
survival. All statistical tests were conducted at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.

SIGNIFICANCE

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

AA is an essential nutrient and key chemical signal for cell growth and metabolism. The
present study shows that Rab1A, a small GTPase previously known for vesicular
trafficking, has a crucial role in Rag- and lysosome-independent activation of mTORC1
by AA, as well as elucidates a Golgi-based mechanism by which Rab1A engages
mTORC1 interaction with Rheb. It further demonstrates that aberrant hyper-activation of
AA signaling through Rab1A overexpression is a common event driving oncogenic
transformation and malignant growth. Moreover, Rab1A overexpression renders
rapamycin sensitivity, suggesting that it is a determinant for mTORC1-targeted cancer
therapy. Further study of this process could have important implications in normal cell
physiology, and the pathobiology and therapy of human cancer.
