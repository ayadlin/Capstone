Abstract

Introduction

Overexpression and enhanced activity of insulin-like growth
factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) in diverse tumor types make it an
attractive target for cancer therapy. BMS-536924 is a potent
small molecule inhibitor of IGF-IR, which shows antitumor
activity in multiple tumor models, including sarcoma. To
facilitate the development of IGF-IR inhibitors as cancer
therapy, identification of biomarkers for selecting patients
most likely to derive clinical benefit is needed. To do so, 28
sarcoma and neuroblastoma cell lines were screened for
in vitro response to BMS-536924 to identify sensitive and
resistant cell lines. Notably, Ewing’s sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma are more responsive to BMS-536924,
suggesting these specific subtypes may represent potential
targeted patient subpopulations for the IGF-IR inhibitor. Gene
expression and protein profiling were performed on these cell
lines, and candidate biomarkers correlating with intrinsic
and/or acquired resistance to BMS-536924 were identified.
IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-IR were highly expressed in sensitive cell
lines, whereas IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-6 were highly expressed in
resistant lines. Overexpression of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and its ligands in resistant cell lines may
represent one possible resistance mechanism by the adaptation of IGF-IR–independent growth using alternative signaling
pathways. Based on cross-talk between IGF-IR and EGFR
pathways, combination studies to target both pathways were
performed, and enhanced inhibitory activities were observed.
These results provide a strategy for testing combinations of
IGF-IR inhibitors with other targeted therapies in clinical
studies to achieve improved patient outcomes. Further
exploration of mechanisms for intrinsic and acquired drug
resistance by these preclinical studies may lead to more
rationally designed drugs that target multiple pathways for
enhanced antitumor efficacy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(1):161–70]

The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis plays an essential role
in regulating cellular growth, differentiation, apoptosis, tumor
angiogenesis, and metastasis and in conferring radioresistance and
multiple drug resistance (1). It is a complex multifactorial system
consisting of ligands, receptors, and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs).
Under normal physiologic conditions, the balance between the
expression and activities of these molecules is tightly controlled;
changes in this delicate balance may trigger a cascade of molecular
events that can ultimately lead to malignancy (2). Binding of its
ligands to IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) initiates a cascade of events
leading to activation of mitogenic signaling pathways [Ras/Raf/
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)] and antiapoptotic/
survival pathways (PI3K-Akt/mTor), resulting in proliferation,
transformation and survival in tumor cells (3, 4). IGF-IR overexpression and/or enhanced activity has been observed in diverse
tumor types, suggesting the potential therapeutic use of agents
targeting this pathway may be broad. Various drug discovery
approaches, including monoclonal antibody, small molecule
inhibitor, antisense, IGF-I peptide mimetic, and dominant-negative
mutants that lack enzyme activity have been explored in recent
years to modulate the function of IGF-IR and reverse the malignant
phenotype in tumor cells (5, 6).
Sarcomas and neuroblastomas are areas of highly unmet medical
needs. Due to aggressive local behavior and high metastatic
propensity, survival rates of these rare cancers are disappointingly
low with multimodal treatments and very aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens. IGF-IR and its ligands undergo autocrine/
paracrine regulatory responses, which are important growth
regulators in sarcomas (7–10). Inhibition of IGF-IR by antibodies
or small molecules, either alone or in combination with other
chemotherapeutic agents, has shown antitumor activity in
sarcomas (11–13). IGF-IR and insulin receptor are structurally
and functionally related and can form heterotetrameric receptors.
Insulin receptor activates signaling pathways similar to IGF-IR and
has been implicated in human cancers (14, 15). In addition to
IGF-IR, preclinical data support an important role for insulin
receptor in regulating IGF action, either as a hybrid or holoreceptor
(16). Increased insulin sensitivity in breast cancer was observed
when targeting IGF-IR (17). Agents targeting all of the receptors
responsible for IGF signaling may be necessary to disrupt the
malignant phenotype regulated by this growth factor receptor
family. BMS-536924, a small molecule inhibitor potent against both
IGF-IR and insulin receptor (18), may not only be an advantage but
a prerequisite in treating cancers. BMS-536924 showed antitumor

activity both in vitro and in vivo in multiple tumor types and is
most potent in sarcomas (18).
The development of targeted therapies, such as Herceptin and
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors, have
shown that careful measurement of biomarkers is necessary to
identify a subset of patients having receptor-driven tumors (19, 20).
Targeting IGF-IR may only be successful if the receptor is
absolutely necessary for pathogenesis and tumor progression.
Therefore, one of the integral goals in the development of
BMS-536924 is to identify biomarkers that can be used to select
the patient population most likely to benefit from the therapy.
More recently, gene expression profiling studies have shown the
advantages of molecular signatures in predicting chemotherapeutic
responses and guiding targeted therapies (21–24). By using
molecular signatures to personalize effective drugs for the right
patients, cancer treatments in the future could be vastly improved.
The purposes of the present study are to identify molecular
signature associated with the sensitivity to BMS-536924 using
gene expression profiling and LC/MS-based label-free protein
profiling, to elucidate the possible resistance mechanisms to the
inhibitor, and further to explore combination strategies to

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. All cell lines were provided by Dr. Lee Helman and grown in
RPMI medium + GlutaMax supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 10 mmol/L HEPES, penicillin, and streptomycin. For the baseline
profiling study, cells were harvested at 70% to 80% confluence. To develop
acquired resistant cells to BMS-536924, sensitive RD-1S cells (IC50, 0.238
Amol/L) were first exposed to the drug at the IC50 concentration and then at
gradually increasing concentrations every other culture passage. The IC50
value to the compound was measured periodically during this treatment
time until the resistance level reached a plateau. The resulting resistant
RD-1R cells have an IC50 of 2.0 Amol/L to BMS-536924.
In vitro cellular proliferation assays. Cell proliferation was evaluated
by [3H]thymidine incorporation after exposure to BMS-536924 for 72 h.
Cells were plated at an optimized density in 96-well plates, incubated
overnight at 37jC, and then exposed to a serial dilution of the drug. After a
72-h incubation, cells were pulsed with 4 ACi/mL [3H]thymidine (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h, trypsinized, harvested onto UniFilter-96

Protein profiling. Label-free protein profiling (26, 27) was performed
using 26 cell lines. Briefly, the cells were lysed, protein was extracted, and
total protein content was normalized across all the cell lines. Tryptic
digestion of protein extraction was performed, and the resulting peptide
mixtures were analyzed by a high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry. Mass spectral data were processed with a suite of proprietary
in-house software; the data went through charge state reduction, isotope
deconvolution, retention time adjustment to yield a list of unique peptide
ions with information of accurate mass, retention time, and associated
intensity (corresponds to peptide abundance). The signal intensity for each
unique peptide ion in the mass spectrometer was used as an indicator for
the expression level of its corresponding protein in the cell lines.
Approximately, 10,000 unique peptides were detected in this study for each
sample. All these unique peptide ions were then subjected to relevant
statistical tests (detailed below). The resulting unique peptide ions of
interest were then subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for
sequence identifications. The generated MS/MS spectra were submitted for
database searching by SEQUEST (28) for peptide sequence information and
subsequent yield protein identifications.
Statistical analyses of baseline gene and protein expression of cell
lines. The gene expression raw data were normalized by the Robust
Multichip Average (RMA) method (29), whereas the label-free protein
profiling data were quantile normalized. Two separate statistical analyses

GF/B plates (PerkinElmer); scintillation was measured on a TopCount
NXT. Results were expressed as an IC50, which is the drug concentration
required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50% compared with untreated
control cells. The mean IC50 and SD from multiple tests for each cell line
were calculated.
In vitro drug combination study. A dilution of ratios of drug
combination method (25) was used in cellular proliferation assays to
determine whether there was synergy, additivity, or antagonism when two
compounds were added simultaneously to cells in vitro. Drug stock solutions
for two compounds were combined in ratios of 10:1, 5:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5.
These ratios, as well as the individual compound stock solutions, were
diluted in a serial manner using 70% DMSO. These serial dilutions were then
mixed with RPMI growth medium and added to cells to test the IC50 values of
single agent as well as two compounds in the cellular proliferation assays.
Combination indices, SEs, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for
the different ratios and used to determine if the combination results
represented synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects. Combination index
values below 1 would be considered to be synergistic when the 95%
confidence interval (index value, F2 SE) did not exceed the value of 1.
Gene expression profiling. RNA was isolated from the cultured cells
using the RNeasy kits from Qiagen for generating gene expression data
using Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix), as described
previously (24).

log2(IC50) above the mean log2(IC50) were considered to be
resistant. Although the sensitive/resistant demarcation is arbitrary,
the cut off is around 0.35 Amol/L, which is clinical achievable dose.
It should be noted that the sensitivity or resistance of cell lines is
not correlated with their doubling times, as cell lines in both the
sensitive and resistant groups grow at variable rates.
There is a clear correlation between the sensitive/resistant
classification to BMS-536924 and specific tumor subtypes. Most
Ewing’s sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and all neuroblastoma cell
lines tested in this study are sensitive to the compound, whereas all
fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and malignant pleural
mesothelioma cell lines are relatively resistant (Table 1). The
distribution of cell subtypes is significantly different in BMS536924–sensitive and –resistant groups (P = 0.0004, Fisher’s exact
test). Although the sample size for each subtype is not large enough
to be conclusive, the results suggest that certain tumor subtypes
are more responsive than others which may be of particular
interest in terms of targeted clinical studies for IGF-IR inhibitors,
such as BMS-536924.
Identification of genes/proteins whose expression levels
significantly correlated with in vitro sensitivity to BMS536924. To identify genes or proteins whose basal expression
patterns were strongly correlated with the sensitivity/resistance
classification to BMS-536924, both gene and protein expression
profiling were performed in parallel using the 28 cell lines. Two
statistical methods were applied to the expression data sets, the
two-sample t-test and Pearson’s correlation; the latter has the
benefit of avoiding the arbitrary classification cutoff required
for the two-sample t-test. The genes/proteins exceeding the
significance threshold (P < 0.001) in both statistical tests were
identified. For gene expression profiling, the molecular signature
consists of 497 probe sets representing 386 unique genes
(Supplementary Table S1); for protein profiling, it consists of
251 unique peptide ions representing 74 peptides from 44 unique
proteins (Supplementary Table S2). Figure 1A and B shows how
gene and protein expression levels of these molecular signatures
correlated with the sensitivity to BMS-536924 in this cell line panel,
respectively. Seventy percent (31 of 44) of identified proteins
(Supplementary Table S2) is overlapping with the genes identified
in Supplementary Table S1, demonstrating good concordance
between the results from two profiling platforms.
Expression of IGFs/IGF-IR and relations to the sensitivity to
BMS-536924. Because BMS-536924 is an inhibitor for IGF-IR and
insulin receptor (18), the expression levels of the receptors and
ligands were of primary interest. Although IGF-IR, IGF-I, and IGF-II
did not pass the stringent statistical significance threshold, their
expression was significantly higher in the sensitive cell lines. The
logistic regression analysis results for IGF-IR, IGF-I, IGF-II alone,
and IGF-I plus IGF-II were shown in Table 2, and the corresponding
receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted in Fig. 1C.
Interestingly, when IGF-I and IGF-II genes were combined into a
single model, the overall predictive ability increased dramatically.
This suggests each of the sensitive cell lines may use at least one of
the ligands for IGF-IR pathway activation, and the IGFs/IGF-IR
pathway may be the predominant driver for growth in sensitive cell
lines. However, the expression level of insulin or insulin receptor
did not predict the sensitivity to BMS-536924 (Table 2). On the
other hand, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-6 had significant higher expression
levels in the resistant cell lines (Supplementary Table S1) and
were able to predict the sensitivity to BMS-536924 (Table 2).
Because some IGFBPs can sequester and inhibit the activity of

were performed on normalized and log2-transformed gene and protein
expression data sets to identify genes and proteins whose expression level
significantly correlate with the sensitivity of cells to BMS-536924. First, a
two-sample t test with unequal variance between resistant and sensitive cell
lines (based on an IC50 cutoff of 0.35 Amol/L) was performed. Second,
Pearson correlation between the normalized expression level of each gene/
protein and the log2 (IC50) values of the cell line panel was calculated to
identify genes and proteins correlated with drug sensitivity (IC50). A logistic
regression modeling approach was used on selected genes to predict
sensitivity to BMS-536924.
Western blot analyses. Cells were treated as indicated in the figure
legends and rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS on ice before harvest. The
protein was extracted in TTG lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol,
0.15 mol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)] with phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail 2 (Sigma). Protein concentrations of total cell lysates were
determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce). Lysates were
resolved by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and immunoblotted with specified
antibodies as indicated in the figure legends in Odyssey Blocking Buffer
with 0.1% Tween 20 (Li-Cor Biosciences). Membranes were then incubated
with appropriate infrared–labeled secondary antibodies, and protein was
visualized using Li-Cor Biosciences Odyssey Infrared Imaging System.
Flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis. Rh41 and Rh36 cells were
treated with BMS-536924 at 0.5, 1, or 3 of IC50 for 17, 24, 48, or 72 h.
Cells were fixed in 0.25% formaldehyde followed by 80% methanol and
stained with p85PARP (Promega) and propidium iodide (Sigma). Cell cycle
effects were evaluated on the FACSCanto with Diva 6.1.1software, and data
were analyzed on gated single cells by using FlowJo 8.5.3 and the Watson
Pragmatic algorithm.

cell lines. To identify cell lines with differential response to
BMS-536924, a panel of 28 sarcoma and neuroblastoma cell
lines was screened in cellular proliferation assays (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The sensitivity of each cell line was presented as an
IC50, and a wide range of sensitivity was observed across this
panel (Table 1). The sensitive/resistant phenotype of this panel
to BMS-536924 was classified as follows: the cell lines with
log2(IC50) below the mean log2(IC50) across all cell lines were
defined as sensitive to the compound, whereas those with

growth factor (P = 0.00004), respectively. The results suggested that
these resistant cell lines may use the EGFR pathway as an
alternative growth signal for proliferation and survival; therefore,
overexpression of the EGFR pathway may represent one of the
primary resistance mechanisms to BMS-536924. Indeed, a recent
study showed that activation and overexpression of EGFR are
sufficient for resistance to BMS-536924 (30).
Genes previously reported to be associated with resistance to
anticancer drugs were also observed in this study with higher
expression levels in the resistant cell lines. Several cathepsin family
members were expressed 2-fold to 14-fold higher in resistant cell
lines (Fig. 2C). Cathepsins are proteases that can cleave and
modulate IGFs and IGFBPs (31). Metallothionein, known to be
involved in chemoresistance and radiotherapy resistance (32), was
another gene family expressed 4-fold to 9-fold higher in resistant
cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3) and may also contribute to the
primary resistance to IGF-IR inhibitor BMS-536924.
Genes associated with acquired resistance to BMS-536924.
Acquired resistance to anticancer agents is a significant clinical
problem. To study the mechanism of acquired resistance to
IGF-IR inhibitor, gene expression profiles of the acquired resistant
RD1R cells (IC50, 2.0 Amol/L) were compared with that of the

IGFs, the role of IGFBP-3 on BMS-536924 resistance was further
tested. As shown in Fig. 2A, in sensitive Rh41 cells, BMS-536924
substantially reduced growth in both complete and conditional
medium; addition of recombinant IGFBP-3 alone also had marked
inhibitory effect on cell growth; however, BMS-536924 has no
growth inhibitory effect in the presence of IGFBP-3, indicating
IGFBP-3 contributors to BMS-536924 resistance.
Possible mechanisms of primary resistance to BMS-536924.
Lower activation or loss of dependency on the IGF-IR pathway in
the resistant cell lines is probably due to the adaptation of an
IGF-IR–independent mechanism of growth by overexpression of
alternative growth signaling pathways. Interestingly, the EGFR RNA
expression level was 6.5-fold higher in the BMS-536924–resistant
cell lines compared with sensitive ones (Supplementary Table S1).
Furthermore, the expression patterns of EGFR protein in this
cell line panel were significantly correlated with RNA expression
(P = 0.00001; Supplementary Fig. S2). EGFR ligands were further
examined; some were also overexpressed in the resistant cell
lines (Fig. 2B). The fold change between the resistant and the
sensitive cell lines was 4.8-fold, 33.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 6.9-fold
for transforming growth factor a (TGFa; P = 0.002), amphiregulin
(P = 0.008), epiregulin (P = 0.016), and heparin-binding EGF-like

differentially expressed genes, which may be involved in acquired
resistance to BMS-536924. Interestingly, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3,
IGFBP-5, and IGFBP-7 were expressed at higher levels in the acquired resistant RD1R cells compared with the parental sensitive
RD-1S (Fig. 2D), whereas IGF-II had an inverse expression pattern
(data not shown).
Genes correlated with both primary and acquired resistance
were identified (Supplementary Table S3), which suggests
possible common mechanisms for both types of drug resistance
to BMS-536924. DSG2, THBS1, and CD55 are examples (Supplementary Fig. S4). Further studies to confirm the role of these
genes in contributing to BMS-536924 resistance will require
cross-validation in independent models of acquired resistance
and functional testing.

BMS-536924 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis preferentially in the sensitive cells. A pair of human
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines with differential sensitivity to BMS536924, Rh41 (sensitive; IC50, 0.069 Amol/L) and Rh36 (resistant;
IC50, 1.6Amol/L) were chosen for further studies. No mutations on
IGF-IR were observed in either cell line. Rh41 cells had a significant
IGF-IR expression but limited insulin receptor, whereas Rh36 had
relatively low IGF-IR but abundant insulin receptor as detected at
both RNA and protein levels (Fig. 3A). This was confirmed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses (Supplementary
Fig. S5). As shown in Fig. 3B, pIGF-IR/pIR was activated upon
IGF-I/insulin stimulation and the activation was inhibited by
BMS-536924 at similar potencies in both cell lines. However, the
activation of downstream signaling components was inhibited by
the drug preferentially in sensitive Rh41 cells in a dose-dependent

fashion, as evidenced by decreased pAkt, whereas in the resistant
Rh36 cells, a much higher dose of BMS-536924 was required to
achieve the same inhibitory effects. Similar effects of BMS-536924
on pMAPK were also observed (data not shown). Compared
with Rh41, Rh36 has much higher levels of EGFR (Supplementary
Fig. S2) and Her2 (data not shown), suggesting Akt and MAPK
may be activated through alternative growth factor pathways
in addition to IGF-IR/insulin receptor pathway in Rh36, so
targeting IGF-IR/insulin receptor may not be sufficient to inhibit
downstream pathways.
To examine the effects of BMS-536924 on IGF-IR/insulin receptor
downstream pathways, preferentially in sensitive cells, Rh41 and
Rh36 cells were treated with BMS-536924. Genes differentially
modulated in the two cell lines were evaluated using gene
expression profiling. Overall, the drug had little effect on gene
expression in resistant Rh36 cells compared with the sensitive Rh41
cells in which 30% of the genes had dramatic change in expression
levels upon the drug treatment. Many genes involved in multiple
pathways, such as apoptosis, cell growth and proliferation, and cell
cycle regulation, were modulated by BMS-536924 treatment in
Rh41 cells (Supplementary Table S4). For example, the expression
of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) was up-regulated (Fig. 3C),
suggesting induction of apoptosis. Indeed, increased cleavage of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Fig. 3D) and caspase-3
(data not shown) were observed preferably in Rh41 cells treated
with BMS-536924. In contrast, the proliferation marker Ki-67 was
down-regulated by BMS-536924 in the sensitive Rh41 cells, but not
in resistant Rh36 cells (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results
suggest that induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation
by BMS-536924 occurs preferentially in the sensitive cell line.
Effects of BMS-536924 on cell cycle and apoptosis in Rh41 and
Rh36 were further analyzed by FACS. There was no significant
difference in cell cycle profiles in both cell lines after exposure to
BMS-536924 at 0.5, 1, and 3 of corresponding IC50 value for
each cell line for up to 72 hours, whereas the PARP cleavage is
significantly higher in Rh41 cells (data not shown), which is
consistent with Fig. 3D. These results indicated apoptosis is not
caused by cell cycle perturbations in sensitive cells.

Significant differences in multiple pathways between sensitive and resistant cell lines to BMS-536924. Pathway analysis on
the gene expression data from the 28 cell line panel using global
test showed that 74 of the 182 tested KEGG pathways were
significantly (FWER adjusted P < 0.05) associated with the
sensitive/resistant classification to BMS-536924 (Supplementary
Table S4). Pathways including apoptosis, signaling via MAPK,
TGFh, Jak-STAT, insulin, VEGF, and natural killer cell-mediated
cytotoxicity were among the pathways significantly different
between the sensitive and resistant cell lines and may contribute
to the differential sensitivity to the IGF-IR inhibitor. It was noticed
that antiapoptotic genes, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL , and API2 have
higher expression in the resistant cell lines. This may speculate that
resistant cell lines have higher threshold to be apoptotic due to the
presence of other growth signaling pathways in addition to IGF-IR.
This is in agreement with Fig. 3D that BMS-536924 does not induce
apoptosis in the resistant Rh36 cells and, with Fig. 2B, that resistant
cells have higher expression of EGFR.
Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed on genes that
significantly correlated with the sensitivity to BMS-536924 in this
cell line panel. In the most significant network, overexpression and
cross-talk between multiple kinases (e.g., EGFR, MET, TGFhR2)
were observed in BMS-536924–resistant cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S6). In addition to IGF-IR, overexpression of alternative growth
signal pathways, such as EGFR in resistant cell lines (Fig. 2B), may
explain why they survive and proliferate even in the presence of
BMS-536924. Targeting multiple pathways may be necessary to
sufficiently inhibit the growth of resistant cells.
Enhanced activity between inhibitors of IGF-IR and EGFR
pathways. Because tumor cells rely on multiple receptors for
activation of critical signaling pathways, strategies designed to
block signaling from these receptors may be advantageous. Given
the important roles of IGF-IR and EGFR in cell cycle progression,
combination studies were performed to investigate whether
inhibition of IGF-IR and EGFR may result in enhanced growth
inhibition in Rh36 cells, which expresses both EGFR and HER2.

IGFBP-4), maintain a reservoir of IGFs in the circulation (e.g.,
IGFBP-3), inhibit IGF action, and mediate IGF-independent
biological effects (1, 38). Several IGFBPs have been implicated
in drug resistance. IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 were reported to be
significantly higher in ovarian cancer patients who failed
treatment with letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, compared with
responders (39); IGFBP-2 mRNA and protein levels were overexpressed in cell lines resistant to the antiestrogens, Faslodex/
Fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or RU 58,668 (40) or to multikinase
inhibitor dasatinib (24).
IGFBPs actions can be modulated by IGFBP proteases, and there
are at least three classes of proteases, cathepsins, kallikreins, and
matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) that cleave IGFBPs. The levels of
cathepsin B and/or cathepsin L have been shown to correlate with
drug resistance (41, 42). Interestingly, higher basal expression levels
of cathepsin B, L, Z, and D (Fig. 2C), kallikrein 5, and kallikrein 6
(data not shown) were observed in BMS-536924–resistant cell lines.
Increased expression of MMP1 and MMP2 also observed in BMS536924 acquired resistant cells (data not shown). These results
suggest that elevation of proteases that modulate IGFBPs action
may be one of the potential mechanisms of resistance to IGF-IR
inhibitor BMS-536924.
DSG2, THBS1, and CD55 overexpressed in both primary and
acquired resistant cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting
some potential common mechanisms for both types of resistance
to BMS-536924. These genes are all somehow involved in drug
resistance (43–45); further study of their roles in resistance to BMS536924 is warranted.
BMS-536924 has similar potencies to inhibit pIGF-IR/pIR in
both Rh41 and Rh36, but is more effective at inhibiting pAkt in
Rh41 cells compared with Rh36 cells (Fig. 3B). It is possible that
only IGF-IR–driven activation of Akt and MAPK signaling is
dominant for survival in sensitive Rh41 cell, whereas in resistant
Rh36 cells, IGF-IR is not the only survival factor and other factor
or receptor-driven activation of downstream signaling effectors
for survival may be dominant. Therefore, cells totally dependent
on IGF-IR signaling for survival and apoptosis are highly
susceptible to IGF-IR inhibitor BMS-536924. Furthermore,
apoptosis is induced by BMS-536924 predominantly in the
sensitive cell line, as evidenced by up-regulation of PDCD4
(Fig. 3C), increased cleavage of PARP (Fig. 3D), and reduction of
survivin (data not shown).
Inhibition of oncogenic kinases has proved to be a valuable
strategy for target-specific treatment of an ever-increasing number
of cancer types. These include the treatment of HER2-positive
breast cancers with HER2 antibody trastuzumab, chronic myeloid
leukemia with the BCR-ABL inhibitors, imatinib and dasatinib, and
colorectal and non–small cell lung cancer with the EGFR inhibitors
cetuximab and erlotinib. Unfortunately, initial success is often
hampered by a relatively rapid onset of resistance to the drugs and
subsequent relapse particularly in patients with advanced disease.
In addition to developing mutations, loss of target dependence due
to the activation of parallel signaling pathways has been reported
as cause for acquired drug resistance (46, 47). Revelation of drug
resistance mechanistic details could provide the basis for the
development of therapies with novel or conventional antitumor
drugs in combination with specific inhibitors to reestablish
chemosensitivity. From the present study, it is noteworthy that
in the cell lines with primary resistance to BMS-536924, other
kinases, such as EGFR, TGFhR2, and Met, were overexpressed
(Supplementary Table S1). This may suggest that loss of IGF-IR

(33) or an EGFR inhibitor gefitinib; synergistic or additive
antiproliferative effects (Supplementary Fig. S7) were observed,
respectively. The synergistic effects were also observed in vitro with
another IGF-IR inhibitor in combination with either EGFR or panHER inhibitor in Rh36 cell line (data not shown) and further
supports the rationale for combining IGF-IR and EGFR inhibitors.
Furthermore, in vivo combination of BMS-536924 with Erbitux in
xenografts also showed enhanced antitumor activities (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Discussion
Because there may be only a subset of patients response to
IGF-IR inhibitors, selecting patients most likely to derive clinical
benefit could help clinical development of BMS-536924. In this
study, a correlation between the sensitive/resistant classification to
BMS-536924 and cell subtypes in the panel of cell lines was found:
Ewing’s sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma are
more sensitive to the inhibitor, making these subtypes the
preferred target population for the drug. The observation is in
agreement with favorable clinical response data showing that
several chemoresistant Ewing’s sarcoma patients have benefited
from therapies using an antibody against IGF-IR (34).
Ewing’s sarcomas overexpress IGF-IR and rely on signaling
through IGF-IR for growth and transformation (10). It is known
that 85% of Ewing’s sarcoma have t(11;22)(q24:q12) chromosomal
translocation that generates an EWS-FLI-1 fusion protein, an
aberrant transcriptional activator that alters the expression of its
target genes, including TGFhRII and IGFBP-3 (35). RNA interference knockdown of the EWS-FLI-1 fusion gene in Ewing’s cells
leads to the up-regulation of a group of genes, including IGFBP-3,
IGFBP-6, TGFhIIR, TGFhI, PLAUR, and CD44 (36, 37). These genes
highly expressed in BMS-536924–resistant cell lines (Supplementary Table S1), implicating the potential role of EWS-FLI-1 in
sensitivity to IGF-IR inhibitors. However, EWS-FLT-1 translocation
may not be the only factor determining the sensitivity to BMS536924 because other cell types, such as rhabdomyosarcoma and
neuroblastomas, are in absence of EWS-FLT-1 translocation, but
sensitive to the inhibitor.
Using both microarray gene expression profiling and LC/MSbased label-free protein profiling technologies to study a panel of
cell lines, we identified genes and proteins correlated with the
sensitivity to BMS-536924. Components of IGF axis seem to play
an important role in the sensitivity to IGF-IR inhibitor. IGF-I, IGFII, and IGF-IR were overexpressed in the sensitive cell lines; IGF-I
and IGF-II together predicted the sensitivity of BMS-536924 in
these cell lines more efficiently than either ligand alone (Fig. 1C).
These results imply that sensitive cell lines may have enhanced
activity of IGF-IR pathways, and IGF-IR signaling may likely be
the major growth driver for these cell lines. Furthermore, IGFBP-3
and IGFBP-6 overexpression may contribute to the primary
resistance to BMS-536924. Addition of IGFBP-3 in growth medium
decreased the sensitivity of Rh41 cells to BMS-536924 (Fig. 2A),
indicating its role in resistance to IGF-IR inhibitor. Furthermore,
IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-5, and IGFBP-7 were elevated 7-fold to
15-fold in the BMS-536924 acquired resistant cells compared with
the parental sensitive cells (Fig. 2D). IGFBPs are important
members of the IGF axis; they regulate the IGF-I pathway and
influence IGF signaling by modulating the biological accessibility
and activity of the IGFs in several ways: they transport IGFs from
the circulation to peripheral tissues (e.g., IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, and

intrinsic in vitro sensitivity to the IGF-IR inhibitor BMS-536924. The
expression of IGF ligands and IGF-IR seems likely predictive of the
sensitivity to BMS-536924 in sarcomas. A priori screening for IGF-I,
IGF-II, and IGF-IR may help to stratify patients likely to benefit from
IGF-IR inhibitors in patients with sarcomas. This should be tested
retrospectively in clinical studies and then further validated in
perspective studies. One resistance mechanism may be alternate
activation of other parallel signaling pathways, including EGFR.
Enhanced growth inhibitions were observed both in vitro and
in vivo when combining BMS-536924 with different EGFR inhibitors.
Strategies for developing IGF-IR inhibitors as potential combination
agents in clinical trials to achieve activity in chemoresistant tumors
are necessary and will be facilitated by this preclincal study. Further
testing of the genes identified in this study on whether they are
necessary and/or sufficient for the differential sensitivity to agents
targeting the IGF signaling pathway is needed to validate the
hypotheses generated by the present study.

dependence due to overexpression of other kinases and activation
of alternative signaling pathways may play a mechanistic role in
resistance to the IGF-IR inhibitor. The EGFR pathway, for example,
is presumably more activated and may be one of the major drivers
for growth signaling in resistant cell lines, targeting IGF-IR alone
may not be sufficient to inhibit growth of these cells. Based on
these observations, it was hypothesized that an EGFR inhibitor
should sensitize resistant cells to IGF-IR inhibitors. Combination of
BMS-536924 with a HER1/HER2 inhibitor BMS-690514 in Rh36 cells
showed synergistic effects, whereas with EGFR inhibitor gefitinib
demonstated additive effects (Table 3). A recent study showed that
inhibition of IGF-IR or HER receptors stimulates reciprocal
receptor phosphorylation, suggesting a bidirectional functional
cross-talk between the IGF and HER family of receptors; activation
and overexpression of EGFR or HER2 are sufficient for resistance to
BMS-536924 (30). Simultaneous inhibition of both IGF-IR and HER
pathways achieved synergic activity via enhanced apoptosis further
support the observation that cotargeting IGF-IR and EGFR
sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis induction (48, 49). IGF signaling
through IGF-IR has been shown to protect cancer cells from the
cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy therapy (50). IGF-IR inhibitors
may have the potential to be combined with other therapies in a
wide range of tumors to increase the overall survival of patients.
Combining BMS-536924 with cytotoxic agents also resulted in
synergistic and/or additive effects in multiple types of cancer cell
lines (data not shown).
In summary, molecular characterization of a panel of 28 cell lines
led to the identification of molecular signatures correlated with the
