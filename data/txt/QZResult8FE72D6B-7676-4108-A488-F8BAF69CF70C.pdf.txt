Activated Extracellular SignalRegulated Kinase Is an Independent
Prognostic Factor in Clinically
Confined Renal Cell Carcinoma
Lee Campbell, PhD1; Rosa Nuttall, M Pharm1; David Griffiths, MB BCh2; and Mark Gumbleton, PhD1

BACKGROUND: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) promotes proliferation, metastasis, and poor
survival in cancers of the breast, lung, and liver. Advanced localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is extraordinarily treatment resistant and has high recurrence rates despite surgery. Limited data exist regarding the
prognostic significance of activated (phosphorylated) ERK in RCC. The authors hypothesized that activated
ERK (pERK) promotes disease progression and metastasis in localized RCC and may be of value as a biomarker to predict disease recurrence. METHODS: The expression profile of pERK was examined by immunocytochemistry using a tissue microarray constructed from 174 drug treatment–naive patients who had
undergone radical nephrectomy for localized RCC. Levels of tumor-cell specific pERK were scored and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters of RCC and disease-free survival. RESULTS: Immunostaining for
pERK was present in 36% of all RCCs, with a predominance found in the clear cell histologic subtype. High
expression was associated with increased tumor size, increased TNM stage, and vascular invasion. Patients
with pERK-positive tumors had a mean disease-free survival of 4.19 years, compared with 6.38 years for
patients with pERK-negative tumors (P < .001). Cox regression models revealed pERK to be a significant independent predictor of disease-free survival, with a hazards score of 2.9 (P < .001), a value similar to tumor
grade (hazards ratio, 3.01; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Expression of pERK is an independent prognostic factor in RCC that is associated with advanced and aggressive pathologic features of renal tumors and preC 2009
dicts the onset of metastasis in patients with localized disease. Cancer 2009;115:3457–67. V

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous group of highly vascularized invasive kidney tumors,
comprising clear cell or conventional (accounting for 60%-80% of all RCC cases), papillary, chromophobe, and collecting duct subtypes.1 Currently, RCC represents 3% of all cancers and 2% of all cancerrelated deaths and is also 1 of the few cancers whose incidence and mortality rates are growing steadily

worldwide.2,3 Approximately one-third of all RCC
patients will have established metastatic disease at first
presentation; the remainder with clinically localized
tumors usually undergo curative radical nephrectomy.
Approximately 35% to 45% of these will also eventually
develop disease recurrence with metastasis at distant
sites.2,3 However, the clinical course of those presenting
with localized disease is difficult to predict, even within
patients who have similar clinicopathologic parameters.
This reflects intrinsic differences in the molecular and biologic profiles of individual tumors.4
Historically, survival rates for metastatic RCC rarely
exceed 5%, resulting from the inherently refractive nature
of tumors to standard chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and
hormonal therapy.5 The last decade, however, has witnessed an explosion in the understanding of the biologic
behavior of renal neoplasms and the identification of how
key signaling cascades and their molecular determinants
integrate to drive disease progression. This preclinical evidence has led to the emergence of rationally designed
novel drugs that specifically target these aberrant signaling
pathways.6-8 The most developed targeted therapies currently in use for the treatment of advanced localized and
metastatic RCC are sorafenib and sunitinib, 2 orally active
multikinase inhibitors, and temsirolimus, an inhibitor of
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).9 Indeed,
temsirolimus, when used as a single agent, is shown to significantly improve overall survival of patients with metastatic cancer compared with standard therapies for
RCC.10 Despite these advances, challenges within the
field still exist and include among others the need to 1)
optimize the use of such targeted therapies by identifying
patients with high-risk disease who are most likely to benefit from their use as single agents or in combination, and
2) evaluate the efficacy of targeted therapies in nonclear
cell RCC subgroups for which no specific trials have been
reported.11 Therefore the utility of tumor biomarkers that
not only identify high-risk patients but also have value in
guiding treatment decisions for RCC is increasingly realized.4,12-14
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R)/
Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) axis is
shown to be mutationally activated or overexpressed in a
significant number (>30%) of all cancers.15 Once activated (phosphorylated), the terminal protein kinases,
ERK-1/2, are translocated to the nucleus, whereupon an
3458

extensive array of transcription factors are activated,
including among others Elk-1, Fos, and Stat-3.16 These
regulatory mechanisms lead to global changes in gene
expression profiles that mainly, but not unequivocally,
result in promotion of cell growth. Aberrant ERK signaling is associated with other cancer-related processes,
namely tumor angiogenesis, cell migration and invasion,
and drug resistance.17,18 Together this has led to intense
pharmaceutical interest in developing tyrosine kinase
inhibitors that target signal transduction cascades such
as the EGF-R/Ras/ERK and PI-3K/AKT/mTOR
cascades.19,20
Much of the current literature that lends support for
ERK-1/2 serving as a cancer driver has been generated by
the use of in vitro, ex vivo, and mouse cancer models, with
an actual paucity of studies that report its expression, activity, and significance in clinical tumor specimens.21 Of
the clinical immunohistologic studies undertaken to date,
phosphorylated ERK (pERK) has been shown to correlate
with disease progression in melanoma,22 hepatocellular,23
and nonsmall cell lung carcinomas.24 In hepatocellular
carcinoma, pERK is predominantly expressed in poorly
differentiated tumors, and as such serves as a powerful
prognostic factor.23 In this latter study, pERK also was
found to be correlated with the presence of intrahepatic
metastasis, and could retrospectively predict disease recurrence in patients after the complete surgical removal of
initial tumors.23 Trends of increasing levels of pERK have
also been observed in late-stage disease in both lung carcinoma23 and melanoma,22 but it is not an independent
prognostic factor in either disease when analyzed for
patient survival. Conversely, the expression of pERK-1/2
in endometrial cancer25 has been shown to be an independent prognostic indicator associated with a favorable
prognosis. Specifically, patients whose tumors exhibited
low levels of pERK-1/2 actually had significantly lower
disease-free survival and worse overall survival.25 A dichotomy in the impact of activated ERK also exists within
the same cancer type. For example, in some breast cancer
patient cohorts, high activated ERK-1/2 levels are reportedly associated with early stage tumors and negative
lymph node status, and predict long disease-free survival.21 In others, its high expression is reported to correlate with advanced localized or metastatic disease,
tamoxifen resistance, and reduced time to disease recurrence.26 These apparent contradictions may reflect the

disease stage and context dependency of ERK-1/2. In support of this notion, in vitro studies have shown that variations in the magnitude and spatiotemporal expression of
pERK-1/2 can either potentiate proliferation or alternately drive cellular differentiation and senescence.27
The prognostic significance of activated ERK-1/2 in
RCC remains undetermined. To test the hypothesis that
constitutively activated ERK-1/2 may potentiate disease
progression in RCC, we have examined, using tissue
microarray technology, the expression of pERK-1/2 in
176 RCCs resected from patients who had undergone
radical nephrectomy for the treatment of localized disease.
The relative expression of activated ERK-1/2 was correlated with clinical and pathologic variables of RCC, with
the overall aim of determining whether pERK-1/2 might
have prognostic value in RCC patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Archival tumor specimens were identified from the pathologic records and consisted of a consecutive series of 174
patients who had undergone curative radical nephrectomy
for primary kidney tumors presenting between 1992 and
1996. This series of patients (for which ethical approval
was granted by the National Health Service local research
ethics committee) has been previously described elsewhere.28 Tissue blocks, histology reports, and slides were
available in all cases without a priori knowledge of clinical
outcome. For each renal carcinoma, a tissue block was
selected that contained a sample of peripheral tumor for
making the tissue microarray (TMA). Tumors were classified according to: the Hiedelberg system29 and Furhman
nuclear grade30; the presence or absence of any vascular
invasion (either microvascular invasion, renal vein invasion, or inferior vena cava invasion)31; and whether or not
there was capsular invasion with cellular invasion of perinephric fat.32 No patients had received drug treatment or
had evidence of lymph node or distant metastatic disease
before or at surgery.
The median age of the 174 patients was 65 years
(range, 34 years-88 years); 119 were men and 55 were
women. Complete clinical follow-up was performed as
previously described.31,33 Briefly, patients had been
reviewed annually as out-patients for 3 to 7 years (mean
Cancer

follow-up, 4.3 years; median follow-up, 3.92 years [range,
0.3 years-8.09 years]) with the following information
extracted from their records: date of birth, sex, date of surgery, date patient last seen, date on which recurrent or
metastatic disease was first identified, and date and cause
of death. For patients in whom the cause of death was
recorded as RCC but whose time of recurrence was
unavailable, the date of death was considered the endpoint
for disease-free survival.

TMA Construction and
Immunocytochemistry
The customized TMA was constructed with a Beechers
manual tissue arrayer (Beechers Instruments, Inc, Sun
Prairie, Wis) from archived paraffin-embedded renal tumor samples. A single core of representative peripheral tumor (0.6 mm in diameter) was punched from each donor
block, using a specific orientation transplanted into a premolded recipient paraffin wax block. Peripheral tumor
refers to representative viable tumor tissue taken within 5
mm of the growing edge of the tumor. Additional cores
were taken from normal renal tissue (adjacent to some of
the tumors). Serial sections were cut from the resulting
TMA block onto cleaned adhesive glass slides (Superfrost
Plus, Microm International, Walldorf, Germany) at 4 lm
thickness.
Array sections were dewaxed using a sequential series
of graded xylenes and alcohols. The detection of pERK1/2 was undertaken using previously published procedures.26 Briefly, after removal of paraffin wax, the endogenous peroxidase activity within the rehydrated tissue was
quenched (3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 minutes). Antigen
retrieval consisted of microwaving TMA sections in citric
acid (0.1 M, pH 6.0) for 30 minutes, followed by slide
cooling with running tap water. After draining, the sections were equilibrated in 20% normal human serum
(Golden West Biologicals Inc, Temecula, Calif) for 15
minutes at room temperature (diluent, phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]). The primary rabbit antihuman
pERK-1/2 antibody (New England Biolabs, Hitchin,
UK) was applied to each section at a dilution of 1:25 and
incubated overnight at 4 C for a total of 16 hours. Thereafter, the sections were washed (4  1 minutes) with PBS
(pH 7.3), and tissue was immunostained using the
DAKO rabbit Envision staining system (DAKO,
3459

Original Article

Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The TMA sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and finally mounted.

Controls and Scoring of Stained Specimens
Human breast cancer specimens, known to be positive for
pERK-1/2, were run in parallel and served as an appropriate control for evaluation of staining in the kidney tissue.
Negative controls consisted of RCC TMA and breast cancer sections in which the primary antibody had been omitted and replaced with 20% normal human serum
(isotypic control).
Scoring of tumor arrays was performed by a pathologist (D.G.) and research associates (L.C. and R.N.) without knowledge of other pathologic and clinical data.
Expression of pERK-1/2 was assessed semiquantitatively
accordingly to previously described criteria,28,33 with
slight modifications. This scoring system accounts for
both the intensity of immunostain within the nucleus and
cytoplasm of tumor cells and the percentage of tumor cells
involved in each core. Scoring was as follows: 0 indicates
no detectable reaction product (deposit) in tumor cells; 1
indicates very light diffuse or focal light deposit in tumor
cells; 2 indicates light diffuse or moderate focal deposit
(may include very small areas of heavy deposit); and 3
indicates tumor cores containing areas of heavy deposit in
most or all tumor cells.

Data and Statistical Analysis
Analysis of disease-free survival of patients with tumors
demonstrating different scores of staining for pERK-1/2
was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method using
the log-rank test, in which the first appearance of metastasis was considered an event. Patients last seen alive
without metastasis or who died because of causes other
than RCC were considered censored at the date of last
contact or death, respectively. Scores were also converted to a binary simple covariate designated positive
or negative by thresholding according to the most informative split on the initial Kaplan-Meier analysis. For
pERK-1/2, a score of 0 was negative, and a score of 1 or
2 or 3 was positive. The association of positive pERK1/2 expression with recognized histologic tumor prognostic variables (grade, size, vascular invasion, capsular
3460

invasion, and tumor type) was examined by cross-tabulation and the chi-square test.
Multivariate analysis by Cox regression was performed to determine whether positive pERK-1/2 expression had influence on prediction of disease outcome in
relation to other clinical prognosticators for RCC. Previous analysis had already determined that the most influential covariates predicting disease-free survival of these
patients are Fuhrman grade (grades 1 and 2 and grades 3
and 4, respectively, are pooled for analysis), any degree of
vascular invasion (histological correlate of stage T2b), and
invasion of perinephric tissues (ie, capsular invasion and
histological correlate of stage T2a). When these covariates
are taken into consideration, tumor size and type were
found to have no influence on disease-free survival. Therefore, in this current computation, pERK-1/2 was entered
into the multivariate analysis as an independent covariate,
using the enter function together with the covariates
grade, presence or absence of vascular invasion, and invasion of perinephric tissue.

RESULTS
Immunohistochemistry for Activated ERK1/2 in Clinically Confined RCC
Of the 174 cases, 164 were assessable on the array; of
these, 60 (36%) stained positive for pERK-1/2. Immunoreactivity for pERK was detected in both the nucleus and
cytoplasm of tumor cells. In all cases examined, some
degree of cytoplasmic staining coexisted with nuclear
staining (Fig. 1). Cases that scored 1, in which staining
was predominantly light and diffuse, comprised 50% (30
of 60) of all pERK-positive cases. Moderate staining
(score 2) and more extensive heavy immunoreactivity
(score 3) accounted for 35% (21 of 60) and 15% (9 of 60)
of cases, respectively (Fig. 1).
Cross-tabulation of pERK-1/2 with conventional
determinants for RCC is shown in Table 1. Increased
expression levels of pERK-1/2 was found to be correlated
with tumor size (P ¼ .039), TNM staging (P ¼ .013),
and vascular invasion (P ¼ .022). No correlation was
observed between tumor grade and capsular invasion.
Notably increased expression of pERK-1/2 was found to
be significantly associated (P ¼ .006) with nonpapillary
tumors (of which 98% were of the clear cell type) when

compared with the papillary subtype. It is interesting to
note that only 25 of 104 (24%) of patients with pERKnegative tumors developed disease recurrence, compared
with 40% (12 of 30), 57% (12 of 21), and 56% (5 of 9) of
patients whose tumors had pERK positive scores of 1, 2,
and 3, respectively; note that pERK positive-tumors
accounted for 53% (29 of 54) of the total number of
recurrences within this patient cohort (Table 1).

Activated ERK-1/2 and Disease-free
Survival Analysis in Clinically Confined RCC
Univariate survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) indicated that
patients with tumors that did not express pERK-1/2 had a
mean disease-free survival of 6.38 years (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 5.80 years-6.96 years) compared with
4.83 years (95% CI, 3.68 years-5.98 years) for patient
samples scored as 1, 3.53 years (95% CI, 2.12 years-4.95
years) for patient samples scored as 2, and 3.93 years
(95% CI, 2.15 years-5.70 years) for patient samples
scored as 3. Therefore, increasing levels of pERK-1/2 in
tumor samples resected from RCC patients resulted in a
significantly (P ¼ .0017) shorter time to disease recurrence (Fig. 2 Top). This survival analysis also indicated
that patients whose tumors displayed any evidence of
3462

pERK-1/2 staining had significantly shorter time to disease recurrence than patients whose tumors were negative
(Fig. 2 Top). This allowed a separate analysis to be undertaken, in which tumors simply could be categorized as
positive or negative. In this analysis, patients with pERK1/2–positive tumors had a highly significant (P ¼ .0007)
reduced disease-free survival of 4.19 years (95% CI, 3.36
years-5.03 years), compared with 6.38 years (95% CI,
5.80 years-6.96 years) for patients with pERK-1/2–negative tumors (Fig. 2 Bottom). By implication, expression of
pERK-1/2 per se can be used to predict disease-free survival in patients with RCC.

Cox Regression Multivariate Analysis
By using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression
models, we next evaluated whether the expression of
pERK-1/2 could be of prognostic value in the assessment
of primary renal tumors (Table 2). We have previously
shown31 the covariates of tumor grade, vascular invasion,
and capsular invasion to be influential prognostic factors
in RCC, but when tumor size and tumor type were not.
Therefore, tumor grade, vascular invasion, and capsular
invasion together with pERK were entered into the
model. The analysis revealed that pERK-1/2 was a

note, the predictive value of pERK-1/2 was significantly

DISCUSSION
Previous clinicopathologic studies have shown that activated ERK is a reliable predictor of disease progression in
several diverse cancers that include malignancies of the
liver,23 lung,24 and breast.26 Oka et al34 demonstrated a
statistically significant association between pERK expresCancer

August 1, 2009

sion and grade in a small series of 25 patients with RCC.
However, they determined activated ERK levels through
Western blot analysis of whole tumor homogenates, an
approach that suffers from population averaging effects
of contaminating nontumor cells contributed by stromal
and vascular compartments. Although experimental
studies with renal cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts
have provided important insights into the role of pERK
in several disease processes, such as invasion and angiogenesis,35-38 the significance of pERK with respect to
disease progression and survival of patients with RCC
remains unknown. In this current study, we used immunocytochemistry and TMA technologies to examine the
prognostic relevance of pERK expression in 164 cases of
RCC. To allow the direct assessment of the role of
pERK expression in disease progression and to circumvent the issues of drug treatment and coexistent metastatic disease in data interpretation, our unique patient
cohort was selected on the basis that subjects: 1) presented with clinically confined disease only, and 2) had
not received any therapy before surgery. Herein we provide what to our knowledge is the first demonstration
that pERK expression correlates with aggressive and
advanced histopathologic indices of RCC and poor disease-free survival. In addition, our analysis also demonstrated that pERK serves as a highly significant and
independent prognostic biomarker that predicts disease
progression in RCC.
In this study, increased expression of pERK-1/2 was
found to be correlated with the conventional

clinicopathologic variables of tumor size and vascular
invasion. The association of pERK-1/2 with tumor size is
perhaps expected, given that ERK activation has been historically connected with cell proliferation. Nevertheless,
this correlation is highly relevant, because tumor size is an
important prognosticator for patient survival in RCC,39
and is a histopathologic criterion that is incorporated into
the universally accepted TNM classification system used
for staging renal tumors.40 In addition to its direct effect
on cancer cell proliferation, pERK-1/2 may also contribute
to tumor size in RCC via the promotion of angiogenesis,
thereby maintaining the supply of oxygen and nutrients to
the tumor, affording uncompromised growth. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a), a key molecule that facilitates
the process of angiogenesis in RCC, is a well-documented
substrate of ERK in several different cell types.41,42 The
cooperativity of HIF-1a and pERK-1/2 may explain the
high vascular nature of RCC tumors per se and hence the
correlation between pERK-1/2 and tumor size observed in
our current study. Consistent with this view, a recent study
has shown that the specific pharmacologic inhibition of
ERK is sufficient to suppress the growth and angiogenesis
of RCC tumor human xenografts in mice.37
During the final drafting of our current article, a
report by Lee et al43 was published that examined the
prognostic significance of pERK-1/2 in 328 patients with
RCC, comprising patients with localized and metastatic
clear-cell subtypes. These authors stratified patients into
low and high pERK-1/2 groups, and reported that
although pERK-1/2 expression did not reach any independent prognostic significance, high pERK-1/2 expression as compared with low expression was correlated with
better disease-free survival, but only in patients whose
tumors measured <7 cm in greatest dimension; in tumors
measuring >7 cm, they did not demonstrate any correlation between pERK-1/2 and survival. Increased tumor
size appears to be positively correlated with RCC progression. In our own study, restricted to localized RCC and
stratifying patients into positive and negative pERK-1/2
groups, we were able to demonstrate that pERK-1/2 was
an independent poor prognostic factor irrespective of tumor size, although we did note a statistically higher incidence of pERK-1/2 in tumors measuring >7 cm. In our
study, papillary tumors represented 13.4% of total RCCs
(22 of 164), which is typical of any given RCC patient
cohort. Analysis of the nonpapillary cohort still demon3464

strated that increased pERK-1/2 levels served as a significant predictor of disease recurrence in patients with
clinically confined RCC (P ¼ .018). Ethnic differences
between the patient cohort used in our study and that of
Lee et al cannot be dismissed as a basis for contrasting
findings. Ethnicity can provide for different genetic and
epigenetic backgrounds in common tumors that ultimately impact on disease progression and response to
treatment. For example, EGF-R, a key upstream effector
molecule of ERK, demonstrates more frequent mutations
in Asian nonsmall cell lung carcinoma populations.44
Although immunohistochemistry provides opportunity
to determine both the global and cellular distribution of
pERK-1/2 within renal tumors, it does not allow discrimination between the exact involvement of the individual
activated ERK isotypes (ie, pERK-1 vs pERK-2) in disease
progression. The possibility exists that the mouse monoclonal antibody used in the study by Lee et al43 and the
rabbit polyclonal antibody used by ourselves in this current study preferentially detect different isoforms of
pERK. Of note, gene ablation studies in mice and in vitro
cell lines have recently shown that ERK-2 predominately
drives Ras-dependent cell proliferation,45-47 whereas
ERK-1 can actually attenuate Ras-dependent tumor formation.47 Using Affymetrix microarray technology,
Huang et al37 recently demonstrated elevated ERK-2 levels in 174 cases of clear cell renal tumors.
Multiple reports have documented the importance
of microvascular tumor invasion as a robust and accurate
determinant of disease progression in RCC. Indeed, in
patients with low-grade and localized disease, vascular
invasion has been shown to be the most significant independent prognosticator of all pathologic parameters
examined. The current study finding that pERK expression is strongly associated with the presence of vascular
invasion in clinically confined disease is highly relevant
and supports the inclusion of pERK status in staging
schemes and prognostic models for RCC that incorporate
tumor biomarkers alongside conventional parameters.
The clinical correlation between pERK expression and
invasion can be reconciled at the molecular level through
activated ERK induction of extracellular matrix-digesting
enzymes, facilitating cell migration, and invasion into surrounding tissue.48-51 Recently, it has been demonstrated
that the invasive capacity of the human renal cell carcinoma cell line Caki-2 is substantially increased on

attenuated by the combination of small interfering RNA–
mediated down-regulation of ERK-1/2 and chemical inhibition of the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway using PD98059.
Furthermore, it has been reported that leptin36 can potentiate the invasiveness of murine renal cancer cells in an
ERK-dependent manner. Collectively, such mechanistic
studies support the view that activated ERK has a direct
involvement in the process of vascular invasion and hence
the promotion of metastatic disease in RCC, a view further corroborated by our current clinical findings.
In the current study, multivariate Cox regression
analysis determined that pERK was equivalent to tumor
grade with respect to its ability to predict disease recurrence, with calculated hazards scores of 2.96 and 3.01,
respectively. Surprisingly, we failed to demonstrate a correlation or trend between pERK expression and tumor
grade. However, because they are independent of each
other and yet represent highly valid independent prognosticators, both pERK and tumor grade may be viewed as
complementary determinants that could be effectively
used for the improved prediction of metastatic disease in
clinically confined RCC. Prognostic models incorporating individual biomarkers with standard clinical parameters have been developed for RCC with good effect.52,53
For example, malignancy-associated biomarkers that
include, among others, PTEN, p53, and Ki-67 have been
ranked alongside several conventional RCC staging
schemes such as Fuhrman grade, TNM, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. The resultant integrated ‘‘clinical/biomarker’’ allows better
prediction of patient survival than either the panel of biomarkers or clinicopathologic parameters alone.
With the emergence of cancer therapies that specifically target growth factor signaling pathways, attention
has focused on the immunohistochemical evaluation of
suitable biomarkers that can serve as a basis for patient
selection and also as markers of treatment response. ERK
represents a downstream convergence point for several
disparate growth factor signaling cascades, including
among others EGF-R, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), and vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor (VEGF-R).16-18 In our study, we demonstrated
that pERK-1/2 positivity per se is sufficient to signifiCancer

cantly predict disease progression in RCC without the
need to discern between various degrees of expression and
ascertain its exact subcellular localization. However,
pERK-1/2 may also represent a reliable and robust biomarker for the selection of high-risk RCC patients who
may benefit from treatment with novel molecular targeted
therapies, and serve as an appropriate biomarker by which
to measure tumor response to such agents. Indeed, sorafenib and sunitinib, both of which are multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the PDGF-R and VEGFR, are indicated for use in RCC.8,54 Support for this
notion is gained from studies demonstrating that in cancer
patients treated with targeted TKIs, tumor tissue exhibited lower levels of pERK post-treatment. Specifically, significant correlations between reduced pERK and disease
stabilization or partial responses were observed after therapy with sorafenib55 and erlotinib56 in patients with metastatic carcinomas of the head, neck,55 and colon,56
respectively.
In summary, the results of the current study indicate
that pERK-1/2 is an independent prognostic biomarker
that significantly predicts the onset of metastasis in clinically confined RCC. In addition, we propose that pERK1/2 may be used to better select patients with renal cancer
who may benefit from treatment with specific molecular
targeted therapies and/or as a tumor marker to measure
and monitor treatment efficacy when using such agents.
Further validation is required in other patient cohorts.
