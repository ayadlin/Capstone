Chromogranin A Regulates Tumor Self-Seeding and
Dissemination

Abstract
Cancer progression involves the seeding of malignant cells in circulation and the colonization of distant organs.
However, circulating neoplastic cells can also reinﬁltrate the tumor of origin. This process, called "tumor-self
seeding," can select more aggressive cells that may contribute to cancer progression. Here, using mouse mammary
adenocarcinoma models, we observed that both tumor self-seeding and organ colonization were inhibited by
chromogranin A (CgA), a protein present in variable amounts in the blood of cancer patients. Mechanism studies
showed that CgA inhibited the shedding of cancer cells in circulation from primary tumors, as well as the
reinﬁltration of tumors and the colonization of lungs by circulating tumor cells. CgA reduced gap formation
induced by tumor cell–derived factors in endothelial cells, decreased vascular leakage in tumors, and inhibited the
transendothelial migration of cancer cells. Together, our ﬁndings point to a role for circulating CgA in the
regulation of tumor cell trafﬁcking from tumor-to-blood and from blood-to-tumor/normal tissues. Inhibition of
the multidirectional trafﬁcking of cancer cells in normal and neoplastic tissues may represent a novel strategy to
reduce cancer progression. Cancer Res; 72(2); 449–59. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
A common feature of most life-threatening tumors is their
propensity to seed tumor cells in circulation and to spawn
metastasis in distant organs (1). This process requires a
complex cascade of events that involve tissue invasion, intravasation, survival in circulation, arrest in target tissues, extravasation, invasion, and organ colonization (2). Recent studies
have shown that circulating tumor cells, either derived from
primary tumors or from metastatic colonies, can reinﬁltrate
their tumor of origin (or other tumor masses) in a process that
is called "tumor-self seeding" (3, 4). On the basis of data
obtained in animal models, it has been proposed that tumor
cells acquire, after their excursion outside their site of origin, a
more aggressive phenotype that may contribute to accelerate
the growth of primary tumors and the breeding of metastatic
progenies (3). Studies on the mechanisms that regulate the
trafﬁcking of cancer cells in normal and neoplastic tissues may
be, therefore, of great experimental and clinical interest.
It has been reported that hematogenous metastasis can
originate from the proliferation of endothelium-attached
tumor cells (5). Tumor cells can also secrete factors that alter

the endothelial barrier function, facilitating their migration
across endothelial cells (6). For example, VEGF-expressing
tumor cells can promote, via VEGF, the disruption of VE–
cadherin–b-catenin complex in the lung endothelium of mice,
facilitating their extravasation (7). Furthermore, the enhancement of VE–cadherin–dependent endothelial barrier function
with activated protein C has been shown to limit cancer cell
extravasation in normal tissues (8). Thus, whereas the presence
of vessels with tight endothelial barriers may represent an
impediment for the inﬁltration of normal tissues, the presence
of leaky vessels in tumors might facilitate the shedding of
cancer cells in circulation and tumor reinﬁltration. On the
basis of these notions, we have hypothesized that factors that
regulate the endothelial barrier in tumors and in normal
tissues can also regulate tumor self-seeding and dissemination.
We have previously shown that chromogranin A (CgA), an
acidic glycoprotein secreted by normal and neoplastic neuroendocrine cells, neurons and granulocytes (9), can enhance the
endothelial barrier function in normal tissues and protect
vessels from vascular leakage (10). CgA is released in circulation in normal subjects at about 1 nmol/L levels and in several
pathologic conditions, including cancer, at higher levels in the
nanomolar range (11). The CgA1-78 fragment, called vasostatin-1 (VS-1), can inhibit the formation of gaps in endothelial
cell monolayers and the permeability to macromolecules
induced by TNF-a, VEGF, and thrombin (10, 12). Thus, CgA
and its N-terminal fragment are efﬁcient inhibitors of the
endothelial barrier alterations caused by different inﬂammatory and proangiogenic stimuli, which are potentially released
in the tumor microenvironment.
These notions prompted us to investigate whether circulating CgA might affect the tumor self-seeding process and the
dissemination of cancer cells to normal tissues. To this aim, we

studied the ability of circulating CgA (exogenous and endogenous) to affect the self-seeding and the dissemination of
murine mammary adenocarcinoma tumors. We show that
pathophysiologic levels of CgA are sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly
inhibit both processes. Furthermore, we show that CgA can
inhibit the seeding of tumor cells in circulation, the homing of
circulating cells to tumors, and the colonization of lungs in
mouse models. Finally, we provide experimental evidence to
suggest that an important mechanism underlying these effects
is the enhancement of the endothelial barrier function against
tumor cell–derived propermeabilizing factors.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, drugs, antibodies, and reagents
Mouse B16-F10 melanoma cells were from American Type
Culture Collection and TSA cells were provided by Dr. Giulia
Casorati. TSAThy1.1 cells were generated as previously
reported. These cells were cultured as described previously
(13, 14). Ser-Thr-Ala-CgA1–78 (VS-1; ref. 15), human CgA (hCgA),
and murine CgA (mCgA) were prepared by recombinant DNA
technology and expression in E. coli cells as described (15–17).
Anti-human CgA monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5A8 (epitope
CgA53–57), B4E11 (epitope CgA68–71), A11 (epitope CgA81–
90; all IgG1k), and anti-Thy1.1 mAb 19E12 were produced and
characterized as described previously (14, 16, 18). Sulfate latex
beads 4% w/v, 5 mm were from Invitrogen.
Animal models
Studies on animal models were approved by the Ethical
Committee of the San Raffaele Scientiﬁc Institute and carried
out according to the prescribed guidelines. To study the effect
of CgA on tumor self-seeding and metastatic dissemination,
syngeneic immunocompetent BALB/c mice (8-week-old;
Charles River Laboratories) were challenged with TSA or
TSAThy1.1 cells subcutaneously (2  105 cells) and/or intravenously (4  104). Alternatively, C57BL/6 mice were injected,
intravenously, with 6  104 B16-F10 melanoma cells resuspended in 0.9% sodium chloride. Mice were treated intravenously with hCgA or VS-1 (in 0.9% sodium chloride containing
100 mg/mL of human serum albumin) or with other drugs in
0.9% sodium chloride. Drug doses and treatment schedules for
each experiment are reported in ﬁgures and ﬁgure legends. The
presence of disseminated TSAThy1.1 cells in the lungs of
BALB/c mice (Thy 1.2) and in recipient tumors was detected
by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of lungs
or tumors, after excision and disaggregation, with an antibody
speciﬁc for the Thy1.1 antigen (mAb 19E12). Furthermore, the
number of TSA and B16 colonies in the lungs of mice was
counted with the help of a stereomicroscope.
FACS analysis, reverse transcriptase PCR, antibody
detection, and in vitro assays
The methods for Thy1.1 cells detection [FACS analysis,
reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)], antibody binding assay
and other in vitro assays (cell proliferation, migration, invasion,
transendothelial migration, and permeability) are reported in
"Supplementary Methods."

Results
Recombinant hCgA inhibits mouse mammary
adenocarcinoma self-seeding
To investigate the effect of CgA on tumor self-seeding, we
used a syngeneic mouse mammary adenocarcinoma model
based on the subcutaneous implantation of TSA and
TSAThy1.1 cells (TSA cells genetically engineered to express
the Thy1.1 allele) in controlateral ﬂanks of immunocompetent
mice that express the Thy1.2 allele. Immunohistochemical
analysis of TSA tumors with an anti-Thy1.1 antibody (mAb
19E12), done 21 days after tumor implantation, revealed the
presence of islets of Thy1.1þ cells of different size in TSA
tumors (Fig. 1A), indicating that the TSA model is suitable for
studies on tumor self-seeding. Quantiﬁcation of TSAThy1.1
cells that inﬁltrated TSA tumors in mice was obtained by FACS
analysis with the anti-Thy1.1 antibody (Fig. 1B). This assay can
accurately quantify TSAThy1.1 cells added either to cultured
TSA cells or to cells obtained from TSA tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and S1B).
Administration of recombinant human CgA (hCgA, 0.3 mg/
day, i.v.) to mice bearing both tumors (a dose that achieves
physiologically relevant blood levels) reduced the number of
Thy1.1þ cells recovered from TSA tumors (Fig. 1C and D) but
not the tumor volume and the TSA/TSAThy1.1 tumor weight
ratio. These results suggested that the effect on tumor inﬁltration was not due to changes in the tumor masses and that hCgA
can inhibit the seeding of TSAThy1.1 cells into TSA tumors.
Recombinant hCgA inhibits the seeding of tumor cells in
circulation by primary tumors
To dissect the mechanism of action we studied, ﬁrst, the
effect of hCgA on the shedding of cancer cells in circulation by
subcutaneous TSAThy1.1 tumors. To this aim, we treated
tumor-bearing mice with or without hCgA and we analysed
by FACS the presence of Thy1.1þ cells in circulation at day 15.
The results showed a reduced number of Thy1.1þ cells in blood
samples obtained from mice treated with hCgA, either freshly
isolated or incubated for 5 days in cell culture medium containing G-418 (to select TSAThy1.1 cells genetically engineered
with the pRS1Neo-Thy1.1 vector; Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S2). The average number of circulating cell, expressed as
the percentage of white blood cells, decreased from 0.40  0.2%
to 0.03  0.03% in CgA-treated mice. We also analyzed the
mRNA extracted from circulating cells at day 15 by RT-PCR
with primers selective for aminoglycoside-30 - phosphotransferase (APH, a pRS1Neo-Thy1.1 sequence that is absent in the
mouse genome and is present in TSAThy1.1 cells). The results
showed reduced levels of APH mRNA in CgA-treated mice (Fig.
2A). These results, together, suggest that hCgA can reduce the
seeding of tumor cells in circulation by primary tumors.

Recombinant hCgA inhibits the homing of circulating
tumor cells to primary tumors
To further dissect the mechanism of action of hCgA in tumor
self-seeding, we then studied the effect of this protein on the
homing of circulating TSAThy1.1þ cells (injected into the tail

vein of mice) to subcutaneous TSA tumors. Concomitant
administration of hCgA reduced the inﬁltration of circulating
Thy1.1þcells into TSA tumors, as measured by FACS. No effect
was observed on TSA tumor growth (Fig. 2B). These results
suggested that circulating hCgA can impair the inﬁltration of
primary tumors by circulating tumor cells.

A reduced number of Thy1.1þ cells was observed in the lungs of
mice treated with hCgA, compared with the controls (Fig. 2C).
Also in this case, the treatment did not affect the growth of
primary tumors (Fig. 2C), suggesting the reduction of Thy1.1þ
cells present in the lungs was not caused by reduction of
TSAThy1.1 cells in the primary tumors.

Recombinant hCgA inhibits the dissemination of
mammary carcinoma cells from primary tumors to the
lungs
We then investigated whether hCgA can also inhibit the
dissemination of TSAThy1.1 cells from primary tumors to the
lungs of mice. TSAThy1.1 tumor–bearing mice were treated
daily without or with hCgA (0.3 mg) and the number of tumor
cells that inﬁltrated the lungs was analyzed by FACS at day 25.

Recombinant hCgA inhibits lung colonization by
circulating mammary carcinoma and melanoma cells
To assess whether the inhibitory effect of hCgA on tumor
dissemination also involved inhibition of lung inﬁltration and
colonization by circulating tumor cells, we studied the effect of
hCgA on the formation of tumor cell colonies in the lungs of
mice injected with TSA cells into the tail vein. Daily administration of hCgA (see Fig. 3A for a schematic representation of

seeding process. Administration of recombinant VS-1, the Nterminal fragment of hCgA, could also decrease the number of
lung colonies in both models (Fig. 3B and C), suggesting that
the N-terminal region of hCgA contains a functional site.
These results, altogether, suggested that recombinant hCgA
might inhibit the dissemination of tumor cells in mice by
affecting not only the tumor tissue compartment (i.e., the
seeding of cancer cells into circulation and tumor-self seeding)
but also by affecting the engraftment of circulating tumor cells
in normal tissues.
Endogenous CgA inhibits lung colonization by
circulating mammary adenocarcinoma cells
We then investigated the role of endogenous CgA on the
dissemination of cancer cells in mice. To this aim, we studied
the effect of the anti-hCgA mAbs 5A8, B4E11, and A11 (16, 18)
on lung colonization by circulating TSA cells. Studies on
antibody cross-reactivity showed that mAb 5A8, but not
B4E11 and A11, could recognize mCgA (Fig. 4A). Thus, mAb
B4E11 and A11, which belong to the same IgG1(k) isotype of
5A8, could represent good negative controls. Systemic administration of mAb 5A8, but not of B4E11 and A11, increased the
number of lung colonies made by circulating TSA cells (Fig. 4B).
These results suggested that normal levels of endogenous
mCgA contribute to regulate the engraftment of circulating
tumor cells in the lungs.
The effect of omeprazole, a drug known to induce the release
of hCgA in circulation in patients (19, 20), was also investigated.
Administration of omeprazole to mice (1 mg, i.v.) increased the
circulating levels of mCgA from 0.9  0.08 to 1.75  0.27 nmol/L
after 4 days (Fig. 4C). Thus, omeprazole is a valid tool for
inducing a sustained increase of circulating mCgA in mice.
Repeated administration of omeprazole signiﬁcantly
decreased the number of lung colonies formed by TSA cells
(Fig. 4D). This effect was neutralized by mAb 5A8 but not by
mAb B4E11 (Fig. 4D), suggesting that it was mediated by mCgA.
Thus, a moderate increase of endogenous mCgA, as obtained
by pharmacologic treatment with omeprazole, can further
reduce the colonization of lungs by circulating tumor cells.
hCgA inhibits the transendothelial migration of
mammary adenocarcinoma cells through endothelial
cell monolayers
To further investigate the mechanism of action of CgA we
studied, ﬁrst, the effect of hCgA on TSA cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and transendothelial migration in
vitro. hCgA did not affect the viability and the proliferation of
TSA cells (Fig. 5A and B), whereas it increased the migration
of these cells from the upper chamber to the lower chamber of
transwell systems coated without or with Matrigel (in migration and invasion assays, respectively; Fig. 5C). No proteolytic
processing of CgA occurred during the assays, as indicated by
Western blot analysis of cell supernatants (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, hCgA did not alter the production of MMP-2 and MMP-9
by TSA cells, two enzymes that play important roles in tumor
cell invasion (Fig. 5D). Finally, hCgA inhibited the migration of
TSA cells through endothelial cell monolayers (Fig. 5E). hCgA
could also inhibit the transendothelial migration of B16-F10

454

Cancer Res; 72(2) January 15, 2012

cells (Fig. 5E) as well as their motility in the migration and
invasion assays (Supplementary Fig. S3). The reduced motility
may explain the stronger inhibition observed in the transendothelial migration assay, compared with TSA cells. No proteolytic processing of CgA occurred during the assays, and no
effect of hCgA on cell proliferation was observed also in the
case of B16-F10 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3 A–C).
Exogenous hCgA and endogenous mCgA enhance the
endothelial barrier function in TSA tumors
We have previously shown that CgA can enhance the
endothelial barrier function in the liver (10). To assess whether
CgA can enhance the endothelial barrier function also in
tumors, which could be crucial for the regulation of tumor
cell trafﬁcking, we investigated the effect of exogenous and
endogenous CgA on the penetration of the anti-Thy1.1 antibody (mAb 19E12) in TSAThy1.1 tumors. Tumor-bearing mice
were pretreated with hCgA, or with the neutralizing anti-CgA
mAb 5A8, and then with mAb 19E12. Tumors were excised,
disaggregated, and analyzed by FACS to assess the binding of
anti-Thy1.1 antibody to tumor cells. hCgA and mAb 5A8
decreased and increased, respectively, the amount of antibody
molecules that reached the tumor cells, compared with controls (Fig. 6A and B). These results suggested that CgA, either
exogenously administered or endogenously produced, can
regulate the vascular leakage in tumors.
hCgA protects the endothelial barrier against TSA cell–
derived propermeabilizing factors
To investigate whether TSA mammary adenocarcinoma can
release factors capable to disrupt the endothelial barrier
integrity, we carried out endothelial permeability assays with
TSAThy1.1 cell supernatants (TSA-SN). TSA-SN induced VE–
cadherindependent junction disassembly and gap formation
and increased the paracellular transport of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–dextran through endothelial cell monolayers to an extent similar to that induced by TNF, a well known
propermeabilizing cytokine. Notably, hCgA inhibited all these
effects (Fig. 6C and D).
Using a multianalyte proﬁling approach, we then characterized the cytokines and chemokines secreted by TSAThy1.1
cells. Interestingly, various cytokines and chemokines capable
to disrupt the endothelial barrier integrity were present in the
cell supernatant, including TNF, VEGF, and interleukin 1 (IL-1;
Supplementary Table S1). Remarkably, these cytokines were
detected also in tumor tissue extracts (Supplementary Table
S2).
These results suggested that an important mechanism
underlying the reduced transendothelial migration of cancer
cells is related to the protective effect exerted by hCgA on the
endothelial barrier function.
hCgA affects TNF-induced expression of proteins
involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement in endothelial
cells
As changes in endothelial cell shape and cytoskeleton rearrangement have been implicated in the regulation of the
endothelial barrier, we then carried out high-throughput

expression proﬁling of endothelial cells treated with hCgA,
alone or in combination with TNF. Both proteins could affect
the expression of several intracellular molecules known to be
involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton (Supplementary
Fig. S4; ref. 21). For example, hCgA increased the amount of
phosphorylated coﬁlin (as also checked by Western blot analysis, Supplementary Fig. S5), whereas TNF increased phosphoezrin, MEKKK1, and several other proteins. Notably, hCgA
inhibited various TNF-induced effects (Supplementary Fig.
S4), suggesting that this mechanism may contribute to the
inhibitory effect exerted by hCgA on endothelial barrier
function.

hCgA inhibits the secretion of inﬂammatory cytokines
and chemokines in the tumor microenvironment
Finally, we observed that hCgA can reduce the levels of
various inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines in the
tumor microenvironment, such as IFNg, IL-1a, IL-1b, lymphotactin, and MIP-1b (Supplementary Table S2). As some of
these proteins may contribute to promote an inﬂammatory
microenvironment and to increase the leakiness of vessels in
tumors, the inhibition of their production in the tumor
microenvironment might represent an additional mechanism for the enhancement of the endothelial barrier function by CgA.

Discussion
The results show that circulating CgA can inhibit the
dissemination of cancer cells from primary tumors to the
lungs in murine models of mammary adenocarcinoma. Studies
aimed at dissecting the mechanism of action have shown that
CgA can inhibit (i) the shedding of cancer cells in circulation by
primary tumors, (ii) the homing of circulating tumor cells to
primary tumors (necessary for the self-seeding process), and
(iii) the engraftment in the lungs by circulating tumor cells
(another important step of the metastatic cascade). As tumor
self-seeding can contribute to select more aggressive and
metastatic cancer cells (3), it is possible that all these mechanisms contribute to the inhibitory effects exerted by CgA on the
dissemination of cancer cells from primary TSA mammary
adenocarcinoma to the lungs.
How does CgA reduce tumor self-seeding and dissemination? The doses of CgA used in our models could not
affect the growth of primary tumors. Hence, the effect on
metastasis formation was not related to changes in the mass

of primary tumors, pointing to other mechanisms. It has been
previously shown that tumor cells can secrete factors that alter
the endothelial barrier function, which may facilitate their
migration across endothelial cells (6, 7). According to this view,
we have observed that cultured TSA cells release soluble
factors that promote (i) the disassembly of VE–cadherin from
adherence junctions, (ii) the formation of intercellular gaps,
and (iii) the paracellular transport of macromolecules in
endothelial cell monolayers. CgA inhibited all these effects.
CgA also inhibited the migration of TSA cells through endothelial cell monolayers. Multianalyte proﬁling of TSA cell
supernatants and tumor tissue extracts showed that various
cytokines, including TNF and VEGF among others, were present in TSA cell supernatants as well as in the tumor microenvironment. Remarkably, CgA could counteract the propermeabilizing activity of these cytokines. The hypothesis that
CgA enhances the endothelial barrier function also in vivo is
supported by the observation that administration of CgA to
TSAThy1.1 tumor–bearing mice could inhibit the penetration
of an anti-Thy1.1 antibody into tumors, whereas the

CgA in Tumor Self-Seeding and Dissemination

Figure 6. CgA inhibits vascular leakage in tumors and the endothelial barrier alteration induced by TSA cell–derived factors in vitro. A and B, effect of hCgA and
mAb 5A8 on the penetration of the anti-Thy1.1 mAb 19E12 in subcutaneous TSAThy1.1 tumors. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with hCgA (0.3 mg) or with
mAb 5A8 (10 mg, to neutralize mCgA) and then with mAb 19E12, as indicated. Tumors were excised 4 or 24 hours later, respectively, disaggregated and
analyzed by FACS. The percentage of antibody-positive cells, as stained with Alexa Fluor 546 conjugate anti-mouse IgG, is shown (mean  SE, n ¼ 7–8). C,
effect of CgA on VE-cadherin disassembly and gap formation (arrows) induced by TSA-SN and by TNF in conﬂuent human umbilical vein endothelial cell
(HUVEC). VE–cadherin was detected with a rabbit anti-VE–cadherin antibody and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546 conjugate (red). Nuclei were stained
with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). Bar plot show the mean  SE of a score of VE–cadherin disassembly, obtained by evaluating the number of gaps
and their size in 15 different ﬁelds (score 0, 1, 2, 3, 4: >20, 11–19, 4–10, 1–3, 0 gaps per ﬁeld, respectively). Bar, 10 mm. D, effect of hCgA on endothelial cell
permeability induced by TSAThy1.1 cell supernatant (TSA-SN) and by TNF. The assay was carried out with transwell systems coated with HUVEC monolayers
(see Supplementary Methods). The ﬂux of FITC–dextran through the endothelial cell monolayers at various time points (left) or after 30 minutes (right) is shown.

neutralization of endogenous CgA with mAb 5A8 promoted the
penetration of the anti-Thy1.1 antibody. These ﬁndings, altogether, suggest that CgA can reduce tumor self-seeding and
dissemination by enhancing the endothelial barrier function,
which may be critical for the migration of tumor cells from
tumor tissue-to-blood and vice versa.

Regarding the mechanism of action, we have shown previously that the CgA fragment VS-1 can inhibit TNF-induced
phosphorylation of p38-MAPK, by a pertussis toxin-sensitive
mechanism, as well as VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK
in endothelial cells (12, 22), that is, 2 signaling pathways that
have been implicated in endothelial permeability (23, 24).

Dondossola et al.

Furthermore, the present results of high-throughput expression proﬁling of endothelial cells treated with CgA, alone or in
combination with TNF, suggest that CgA can affect the expression of many proteins involved in the regulation of cell cytoskeleton rearrangement, a process critical for endothelial cell
shape change and vascular permeability.
The results of multianalyte proﬁling of the tumor microenvironment also suggest that CgA can reduce the levels of
various inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IFNg,
IL-1a, IL-1b, lymphotactin, and MIP-1b) that may contribute
to promote an inﬂammatory microenvironment and to
increase the vascular leakage in tumors. On the basis of these
observations, we think that CgA can inhibit tumor cell trafﬁcking through endothelium by improving the endothelial
barrier alterations directly, by affecting endothelial cells, and
indirectly, by reducing the levels of inﬂammatory cytokines in
tumor tissues. Notably, impairment of transendothelial cell
migration and tumor cell dissemination by CgA was observed
also with the B16-F10 melanoma model, suggesting that this
phenomenon was not a peculiarity of TSA cells.
The biologically active doses of recombinant human CgA
used in our experimental models (0.3–1 mg, i.v.) generate
circulating levels of 3 to 10 nmol/L. CgA is present in the
serum of normal subjects at about 1 nmol/L levels (25). Higher
circulating levels (in the nanomolar range) have been detected
in patients with neuroendocrine tumors and in subpopulations
of patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, small and non–
small cell lung cancer (11, 26–28), or in patients with heart
failure, renal failure, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, giant
cell arthritis, sepsis, and atrophic gastritis, or treated with
proton pump inhibitors (9, 25, 26, 29, 30). Thus, the doses used
in this study are biologically relevant as they are in the range of
those found in patients with nonneuroendocrine tumors.
Notably, we observed that neutralization of endogenous
circulating CgA with the anti-CgA mAb 5A8 increases the
formation of neoplastic colonies in the lung of mice injected
with TSA mammary adenocarcinoma cells, whereas the induction of circulating CgA with omeprazole decreased colony
formation in a CgA-dependent manner. These results support

the hypothesis that the endogenous CgA plays a role in the
regulation of tumor cell dissemination.
As discussed above, our study addresses the role of circulating CgA on metastasis formation by nonneuroendocrine
tumors. The role of locally produced CgA, as it may occur in
patients with neuroendocrine tumors, was not investigated
in this study. Although increased circulating levels of CgA in
cancer patients with advanced nonneuroendocrine tumors are
associated with worse performance status, advanced stage,
and worse prognosis (28), to our knowledge, no information is
available on the correlation between CgA levels and circulating
tumor cells or with the probability of onset of metastatic
disease in patients with early-stage tumors.
In conclusion, the results of this work show that pathophysiologically relevant levels of circulating CgA (as it may occur in
patients with nonneuroendocrine tumors) can regulate tumor
self-seeding and dissemination of tumor cells in mice, pointing
to an important role of this protein. The loss of endothelial
barrier integrity caused by tumor cell–derived factors and the
inhibitory effects exerted by CgA could represent important
mechanisms for the positive and negative modulation of tumor
self-seeding and metastatic dissemination processes. These
ﬁndings suggest that drugs that directly or indirectly improve
the endothelial barrier function and reduce the multidirectional trafﬁcking of cancer cells in tumors and in normal
tissues may reduce cancer progression in patients.
