BACKGROUND: Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Study 19802, a phase 2 study, evaluated whether dose intensification of daunorubicin and cytarabine could improve disease-free survival (DFS) in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and whether
high-dose systemic and intrathecal methotrexate could replace cranial radiotherapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis.
METHODS: One hundred sixty-one eligible, previously untreated patients ages 16 to 82 years (median age, 40 years) were enrolled,
and 33 (20%) were aged 60 years. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight patients (80%) achieved complete remission (CR). Dose
intensification of daunorubicin and cytarabine was feasible. At a median follow-up of 10.4 years for surviving patients, the 5-year DFS
rate was 25% (95% confidence interval, 18%-33%), and the overall survival (OS) rate was 30% (95% confidence interval, 23%-37%).
Patients aged <60 years who received the 80 mg/m2 dose of daunorubicin had a DFS of 33% (95% confidence interval, 22%-44%)
and an OS of 39% (95% confidence interval, 29%-49%) at 5 years. Eighty-four patients (52%) relapsed, including 9 patients (6%) who
had isolated CNS relapses. The omission of cranial irradiation did not result in higher than historic CNS relapse rates. CONCLUSIONS:
Intensive systemic, oral, and intrathecal methotrexate dosing permitted the omission of CNS irradiation in adult patients with ALL.
This intensive approach using higher doses of daunorubicin and cytarabine failed to result in an overall improvement in DFS or OS
compared with historic CALGB studies. Future therapeutic strategies for adults with ALL should be tailored to specific age and moC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
During the last decade, attempts to improve the survival of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have focused
on the role of early dose intensification to eradicate minimal residual disease and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant
subclones.1-7 Several trials have explored the role of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation performed in first remission.8,9 Others have tested the efficacy of dose intensification of several of the drugs that are standard components of ALL
regimens.4,10-13 Todeschini et al13 used high doses of daunorubicin (cumulative dose, 270 mg/m2) during induction and
high-dose cytarabine during postremission consolidation and reported a high complete remission (CR) rate of 93% and
an estimated 6-year event-free survival of 55% in a small series of adults with ALL between ages 14 and 71 years.
Effective central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis is also an essential component of therapy. Pediatric ALL regimens have tested a variety of approaches to reduce CNS relapses while minimizing the long-term toxicities of CNSdirected therapies. It has been demonstrated that the substitution of high doses of systemic methotrexate and cytarabine
for cranial irradiation, given in combination with intrathecal (IT) methotrexate and/or cytarabine during postremission
therapy, is feasible and safe in both children and adults with ALL and may result in lower cumulative neurotoxicity.4,12,1417
Others have suggested that the combination of oral, intravenous, and IT methotrexate administered to achieve prolonged serum levels can result in effective CNS prophylaxis.18-20
Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study 19802 was designed to test the hypothesis that dose intensification
of daunorubicin during induction and of cytarabine during the first weeks of postremission treatment would result in
rapid leukemia cytoreduction, lead to high CR rates, and improve disease-free survival (DFS) by preventing the emergence

of drug-resistant leukemia clones that could lead to
relapse. The second objective was to determine whether
the administration of high-dose intravenous, oral, and IT
methotrexate could result in prolonged serum exposure
and safely and effectively replace the cranial irradiation
that was used for CNS prophylaxis in all previous CALGB
regimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

From January 1999 through January 2001, 163 adults
(aged 16 years) with untreated ALL were enrolled on
CALGB 19802. No prior treatment for ALL, including
corticosteroids, was allowed with the exception of emergency treatment for hyperleukocytosis using hydroxyurea

and/or leukapheresis or a single dose of cranial irradiation
for CNS leukostasis. Patients with a mature B-cell (Burkitt) immunophenotype were not eligible for this study.
Chemotherapy

CALGB 19802 treatment consisted of 6 monthly modules of intensive therapy (modules A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, and
C2) followed by 18 months of maintenance therapy (Fig.
1). Planned dose intensification of daunorubicin occurred
during modules A1 and A2; patients received high-dose
cytarabine during modules B1 and B2; and they received
high-dose intravenous methotrexate, oral methotrexate,
and IT methotrexate during both C modules. Patients
also received IT therapy during each of the B modules, as
detailed in Table 1. Previously, CALGB used 3 daily

daunorubicin doses of 45 mg/m2 for patients aged <60
years and 30 mg/m2 for patients aged 60 years. In the
current study, we escalated the daunorubicin dose to 60
mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 through 3 for the first 50
patients and then to 80 mg/m2 on days 1 through 3 for all
subsequent patients aged 60 years. Patients aged >60
years received only the 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin dose. All
treatment ended 24 months after diagnosis. For patients
who had high-risk cytogenetics, including the
t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) and t(4;11)(q21;q23) translocations,
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation was recommended soon after they achieved remission.
Statistical Analysis

The objective of this study was to evaluate the CR and
DFS rates for this regimen as well as the rates of adverse
events. The null hypothesis was a CR rate 70% versus
the alternative hypothesis of a CR rate 80%. DFS was
measured from the date of CR to the date of relapse or
death. The precision for the 5-year DFS estimate was
92

expected to be 10%. Exact 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for the CR rate were computed based on binomial
distribution. CR rates between groups were analyzed
using the Fisher exact test. Survival estimates with 95%
CIs were computed using the product-limit (KaplanMeier) method. Tests for differences in survival distributions between groups were performed using the Score
(log-rank) statistic. SAS statistical software (version 9.1;
SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all statistical
analyses, and S-Plus (version 7.0; Insightful Corporation,
Seattle Wash) was used to generate the survival plots. The
statistical analyses were completed on data as of February
22, 2012.

Patient Characteristics

The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
The median patient age was 40 years (range, 16-82 years).
There was no upper limit on age, and 33 patients (20%)
were aged 60 years.
Pretreatment cytogenetic analyses were performed
by CALGB-approved institutional cytogenetic laboratories on CALGB 8461, a prospective cytogenetic companion study, and the results were centrally reviewed (K.M.,
C.D.B.). Of the 163 enrolled patients, 2 had rearrangements involving 8q24 (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral
oncogene homolog [MYC]), consistent with Burkitt-type
ALL, and, thus, were ineligible for treatment on this
study; and 63 patients (39%) were not submitted or
were not evaluable. Thus, 98 patients (61%) were further
characterized.21,22 Forty-eight patients (49%) were
classified with high-risk cytogenetics, defined as:
t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) translocation or variants (n ¼ 31),
t(4;11)(q21;q23) translocation or other balanced translocation involving band 11q23 (n ¼ 7), chromosome 7 loss
(7) (n ¼ 1), chromosome 8 gain (þ8) (n ¼ 2), and
hypodiploidy with a chromosome number 43 (n ¼ 4).
Thirty-one (32%) were classified with intermediate-risk
cytogenetic, including normal karyotype (n ¼ 18); abnormalities in the short arm of chromosome 9 (9p) (n ¼ 4);
high hyperdiploidy with a chromosome number 50 (n
¼ 6), excluding near-tetraploidy; deletion of the long arm
of chromosome 13 (del[13q]) (n ¼ 2); and a derivative of
chromosome 19 resulting from a t(1,19) translocation
(der[19]t[1,19]) (n ¼ 1). Only 11 patients (11%) had a
favorable karyotype (abnormalities involving region 11 of
the long arm of chromosome 14 [14q11]; (n ¼ 5; deletions and translocations involving 12p [n ¼ 4]; and balanced rearrangements involving 7p14-15 and 7q34-36 [n
¼ 2]). Eight patients (8%) had cytogenetic abnormalities

Remission Induction

One hundred sixty-one patients were eligible and evaluable for response, and 128 patients (80%) achieved a CR
(95% CI, 72%-85%) (Table 2). There were 16 (10%)
treatment-related deaths during induction, and only 1 of
those patients was aged <30 years (2%).

postremission treatment. It is noteworthy that no significant cardiomyopathy was reported for any patient who
received treatment at the daunorubicin 80 mg/m2 dose
level. Life-threatening (grade 4) mucosal toxicities were
reported in 5 patients during treatment, including 4
patients aged <60 years who had received the 80 mg/m2
daunorubicin dose. Grade 4 ataxia attributed to high-dose
cytarabine was reported in 2 patients, both of whom were
aged <60 years. Grade 3 or 4 mucositis and stomatitis
rarely were reported during the C1 and C2 treatment
modules; however, grade 3/4 cytopenia was reported in

who had lower methotrexate levels (P ¼ .004)

bicin dose during induction and postremission therapy,
the 5-year DFS and OS rates were 33% and 39%, respectively, compared with a DFS rate of 18% and an OS rate
of 29% for patients aged <60 years who received the 60
mg/m2 daunorubicin dose (Fig. 4).
Neither initial white blood cell count nor sex had an
impact on DFS or OS in this study. However, survival differed according to both immunophenotype and cytogenetic subset. Patients who had precursor B-cell ALL had a
hazard ratio for DFS of 1.5 compared with patients who
had precursor T-cell ALL (P ¼ .21) and had a significantly worse OS than the precursor T-cell group (hazard
ratio, 1.9; P ¼ .035). Cytogenetics remained an important prognosticator (Fig. 3, bottom). For the 11 patients
who had a favorable karyotype, the DFS rate was 45% at
5 years, and the OS rate was 82%.

(80%) who were enrolled onto Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) Study 19802 achieved complete remission (CR).(a)
The estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate was 25% (95%
confidence interval, 18%-33%). (Bottom) The overall survival
rate at 5 years for all 161 patients was 30% (95% confidence
interval, 23%-37%).

Disease-Free and Overall Survival

After a median follow-up of 10.4 years (range, 1.5-12.7
years) for 39 surviving patients, the 5-year DFS and overall survival (OS) rates for the entire study population were
25% (95% CI, 18%-33%) and 30% (95% CI,23%37%), respectively (Table 2, Fig. 2). It is worth noting
that, with longer follow-up, there were only 3 additional
events (all bone marrow relapses) reported between years
3 and 5 of follow-up. After year 5, there were only 3 more
events, only 1 of which was caused by disease relapse.
Thus, there were very few relapses after 3 years. Patients
aged <60 years fared significantly better than patients
aged 60 years, who had 3-year DFS and OS rates of
only 10% and 6%, respectively (P < .001) (Fig. 3, top).
For younger adults who received the 80 mg/m2 daunoru94

One goal of CALGB 19802 was to replace CNS irradiation by combining weekly, high-dose, systemic, intravenous and sequential oral methotrexate administration
with IT methotrexate. Approximately a third of evaluable
patients achieved an average serum methotrexate level in
the target range of 1 to 2 lM at 30 hours during these
CNS-directed treatment modules. There was a trend toward lower CNS relapse rates when higher 30-hour methotrexate concentrations were achieved; however, the
difference was not statistically significant.
Overall, 14 patients (9%) experienced a CNS
relapse, including 9 patients (6%) who had an isolated
CNS relapse and 5 patients (3%) who had simultaneous
CNS and bone marrow relapses. It is noteworthy that isolated CNS relapses were reported more frequently in
patients who had favorable cytogenetics. Five of 11
patients (45%) with favorable cytogenetics relapsed in the
CNS, and those relapses occurred from 0.4 to 2.7 years after remission. Two of the CNS relapses in the favorable
cytogenetics group occurred in patients who had translocations involving T-cell receptor genes, and the other 3
relapses occurred in patients with precursor B-cell ALL
who had 12p deletions. In comparison, 6 of 31 patients
(19%) who had intermediate cytogenetics and only 1 of
47 patients (2%) who had unfavorable karyotypes had an
isolated CNS relapse (P ¼ .0007).
Adherence to Protocol Therapy

Reasons for protocol discontinuation included failure to
achieve a remission in 6 patients (4%), death during treatment in 21 patients (12%), recurrent disease during treatment in 43 patients (27%), treatment-related toxicity in
16 patients (10%)m withdrawal of consent in 10 patients

(6%), removal for alternative therapies (other than transplantation) in 2 patients, and miscellaneous other reasons
in 11 patients (7%). Thirty-five patients (22%) completed all planned therapy on this multicenter study.
Another 14 patients (9%) with adverse cytogenetics (either Philadelphia chromosome-positive or 11q23 translocation) underwent allogeneic transplantation in first CR,
as recommended by the protocol. Four additional patients
were removed from protocol therapy at their physician’s
discretion and received hematopoietic cell transplantation
in first CR; only 1 of those patients had centrally reviewed
cytogenetics and had a complex karyotype.
DISCUSSION
The importance of anthracyclines for the achievement of
higher CR rates among adults with ALL was demonstrated in an early CALGB randomized clinical trial23;
however, higher CR rates have not translated into significant prolongation in DFS or OS. In the current study, in
which the median patient age was 40 years (older than all
previous CALGB studies of adult ALL), we demonstrated
Cancer

January 1, 2013

that it was feasible to intensify daunorubicin and cytarabine during induction and postremission therapy and to
give effective CNS prophylaxis without cranial irradiation. However, the CR rate of 80% for all patients and the
overall DFS and OS rates of 25% and 30%, respectively,
were not better than what was reported previously in 3
previous CALGB studies of adults with ALL. In partial explanation, the percentage of patients with adverse prognostic features on this study was higher than in any
previous CALGB study—the patients were older, and
49% had an adverse karyotype.
Because the CR rate of adults with ALL already is
high and requires only an approximately 2-log reduction
in the leukemic mass, we hypothesized that the benefit of
dose escalation would be observed in a better DFS and
OS, but probably not in a higher CR rate. This was true
(Fig. 4, top): The DFS curve for the 80 mg/m2 daunorubicin dose cohort crossed the 60 mg/m2 cohort DFS curve
after 2 years and plateaued at a higher level with 10 years
of follow-up. It is noteworthy that, among patients who
received the 80 mg/m2 daunorubicin dose, there were

overall survival (OS) are illustrated according to daunorubicin
dose among patients aged <60 years. A complete remission
(CR) was achieved by 36 of 39 patients (92%) who received
daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 daily. The estimated 5-year DFS rate
for these patients was 18% (95% confidence interval, 7%32%), and the OS rate was 29% (95% confidence interval,
16%-44%). Of the 89 patients who received daunorubicin 80
mg/m2 daily, 72 patients (81%) achieved CR. The 5-year DFS
rate for these patients was 33% (95% confidence interval,

only 4 relapses reported more than 3 years after the
achievement of CR.
The outcomes for patients aged <60 who received
the highest cumulative dose of daunorubicin were similar
to, but not better than, the 41% 3-year DFS rate reported
by Bassan et al in their study of non-Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients who received daunorubicin dose
intensification during induction or postremission therapy1 or the results of Todeschini et al,13 who reported that
daunorubicin dose intensification during induction did
not improve CR rates but resulted in improved DFS. In
their study, Todeschini et al reported that patients who
received a cumulative daunorubicin dose of 175 mg/m2
during induction had a DFS rate of 44% in contrast to
only 22% for those who received a cumulative daunorubi96

cin dose <175 mg/m2. Among our patients aged 60
years, we observed no benefit to dose intensification up to
a cumulative daunorubicin dose of 180 mg/m2 during
induction; the treatment-related death rate was 21%, and
the DFS (10%) and OS (6%) rates remained very poor. A
similar increase in toxicity among older adults and lack of
an OS benefit from liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine intensification also was noted in a recently published
study from Thomas and colleagues at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.24 Previously
defined intermediate-risk and high-risk cytogenetic risk
groups21,22,25,26 did not predict for different outcomes on
this study. One interpretation of this observation is that
the more dose-intensive use of daunorubicin and cytarabine actually did provide a survival benefit to these
patients with poor-risk ALL.
In our current study, we demonstrated that it is possible to replace cranial irradiation by administering intensive, systemic methotrexate together with IT methotrexate
prophylaxis. Isolated CNS relapses occurred in 9 patients
(6%), which is comparable to the CNS relapse rates
reported on 4 prior CALGB studies that included cranial
irradiation. CNS relapse rates on those 4 studies ranged
from 9% to 14%. Our results also are similar to the 4%
isolated CNS relapse rate that was reported by The M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center group in their long-term followup of their hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone regimen, which
does not use cranial irradiation.4 We attempted to adjust
methotrexate dosing to maintain 1-lM or 2-lM concentrations 30 hours after the initiation of high-dose, systemic methotrexate and IT methotrexate based on a
report of its favorable effect on reducing CNS relapses.20
Among 101 evaluable patients, there were no significant
differences in CNS relapse rates noted as a function of
mean 30-hour methotrexate levels. Although we noted a
trend toward fewer CNS relapses in patients who had
higher circulating methotrexate levels, 30-hour methotrexate levels >2 lM also were associated with more systemic toxicities, including mucositis and prolonged
myelosuppression.
Further reductions in CNS relapse rates may be
achieved by the earlier introduction of specific CNSdirected prophylaxis in future study regimens (rather than
beginning 29 days after diagnosis, as in CALGB 19802);
or by the substitution of dexamethasone for prednisone,
which has been associated with lower CNS and systemic
relapse rates in pediatric and adult ALL regimens27,28;
and/or by the use of CNS irradiation only for patients at
high risk of CNS relapse, such as patients with T-cell ALL

who have high initial white blood cell counts.29 A recent,
large, retrospective analysis of CNS relapses in 467 adults
with ALL reported no differences in relapse rates for those
who received CNS prophylaxis with cranial irradiation
compared with those who did not receive CNS irradiation.17 It was noted that the only clinical factor associated
with CNS relapse was a high initial lactate dehydrogenase
level of >1000 U/lL.30 In our study, we could not identify any associations between the CNS relapse rate and
immunophenotype or high initial white blood cell count;
the pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase level was not routinely recorded.
One of the sobering observations in our study was
that 27% of patients relapsed before they completed protocol treatment. Another 22% of patients were not able to
complete therapy because of toxicity, death during treatment (mostly during remission induction for younger
adults who received the 80 mg/m2 daunorubicin dose and
in older adults during both remission induction and postremission therapy), or removal from protocol therapy
because of toxicity. Thus, early dose intensification of the
myelosuppressive drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine was
not a successful strategy to improve DFS or OS. It would
be informative for other clinical investigators to report the
percentage of all enrolled patients who complete all
planned therapy on pediatric and adult ALL studies as
well as adherence to the timing of scheduled treatment for
comparative purposes.
Recent retrospective studies examining outcomes of
adolescents and younger adults with ALL have suggested
that the nonmyelosuppressive agents that are active in
ALL, such as glucocorticoids, vincristine, and L-asparaginase, are critical drugs for intensification to improve DFS
in higher risk children and older adolescents with ALL.3133
Although the intensification of these agents in regimens
for older adults with ALL may pose a clinical challenge
because of their own unique toxicities, early results from
several pilot trials suggest that it is possible to use this
approach in adults up to ages 30 to 40 years with encouraging, albeit, preliminary results.34-36
In conclusion, a singular dose-intensive approach to
the treatment of all adults with ALL is not likely to result
in further significant survival benefits, and there remains
much room for improvement. The biologic heterogeneity
of adults with ALL suggests that this may be achieved best
by the incorporation of biologically targeted agents into
frontline therapy, as demonstrated recently with the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors to frontline therapy for
adults and children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, the promising early data from the pediatric
Cancer

groups on the addition of nelarabine to frontline therapy
for children with T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and the
addition of rituximab to frontline therapy that reportedly
improved relapse-free survival and OS in younger adults
with CD20-positive ALL compared with historic controls.37 Thus, rather than further exploration of dose
intensification as described here in CALGB 19802, innovative therapeutic strategies for adult ALL should be tailored to specific age groups and/or cytogenetic/molecular
genetic subsets.
