Abstract
Cisplatin, an anticancer drug, forms DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) that interfere with replication, whereas TREX2 is a
3¶!5¶ exonuclease that removes 3¶ mismatched nucleotides
and promotes cellular proliferation. Here, we show that
TREX2 is depleted in human cells derived from cancer after
exposure to cisplatin but not other genotoxins including
another cross-linking agent, mitomycin C (MMC), indicating a
potential role for TREX2 depletion in cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity. To better understand TREX2 cellular function,
we deleted TREX2 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by gene
targeting and find these cells exhibit reduced proliferation
and gross chromosomal rearrangements including Robertsonian translocations (RbT). Quite interestingly, ES cells
exposed to cisplatin also exhibit RbTs. By contrast, RbTs are
not observed for ES cells exposed to MMC, indicating that
RbTs are not caused by ICLs but instead TREX2 depletion by
either cisplatin exposure or mutation. Taken together, our
results show that cisplatin depletes TREX2 and causes
genomic instability that is similarly observed in TREX2mutant cells. Thus, cisplatin has two potential cytotoxic
activities: (a) the generation of ICLs and (b) the depletion of
TREX2. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9077–83]

refs. 9, 10), DNA repair proteins (MRE11, WRN, APE1, APE2, XPF/
ERCC1, and Dna2; refs. 11–16), DNA replication polymerases (poly,
polg, and polq; refs. 17–19), and the well-known tumor suppressor
p53 (20). Functional studies by gene inactivation in yeast and
mouse models have shown that mutation in many of these genes
leads to genomic instability (8). Additionally, mutations in some of
these genes, such as MRE11, WRN, XPF, polc, and p53, cause a
variety of pathologies, including cancer and/or age-related disease
(21–26). Our recent study also suggests that TREX2 maintains
genome integrity because it is ubiquitously expressed in tissues and
cancer-derived cell lines, forms nuclear foci, and facilitates cellular
proliferation (7).
Here, we show that cisplatin reduces cytosolic TREX2 in human
cancer-derived cell lines and induces a phenotype common to
TREX2-null mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. After exposure to
cisplatin, nuclear TREX2 foci disappear. Subsequently, total cytosolic
TREX2 levels are reduced. Wild-type (WT) ES cells exposed to
cisplatin, but not mitomycin C (MMC), exhibit Robertsonian translocations (RbT), a phenotype characteristic to TREX2-null ES cells.
Thus, ICLs do not ordinarily cause RbTs, supporting the possibility
that cisplatin induces a TREX2-null phenotype. Therefore, either
cisplatin depletion or genetic deletion of TREX2 causes the same
cellular phenotype, suggesting that TREX2 depletion may be
responsible for cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity along with ICLs.

Introduction

Materials and Methods

Platinum-based anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin, generate a
variety of DNA lesions including monoadducts, intrastrand crosslinks, and interstrand cross-links (ICLs; ref. 1). These ICLs
covalently join both DNA strands to disrupt normal metabolic
functions that require strand separation like DNA replication and
transcription. In addition, a DNA double-strand break (DSB) is
formed when the replication fork collides with an ICL (2). Thus,
ICLs are extremely cytotoxic, especially for proliferating cells (3).
TREX2 is a 3¶!5¶ exonuclease that removes 3¶ mismatched
sequences, suggesting that it maintains genomic integrity (4–7).
Although the biological significance of TREX2 is largely unknown,
this 3¶!5¶ exonuclease activity is evolutionarily conserved (8) and
present in DNA damage checkpoint proteins (hRad1 and hRad9;

Cell culture, DNA damage treatment, immunoblotting, and immunostaining for a variety of genotoxins. HeLa cells [American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC)] were cultured according to ATCC’s instructions.
For DNA damage treatment, HeLa cells were seeded at 50% confluency.
Next day, DNA-damaging agents were added for 4 h. DNA-damaging agents
include streptonigrin (10 nmol/L), paraquat (100 Amol/L), N-acetylL-cysteine (NAC; 10 mmol/L), methyl methane sulfonate (MMS; 400 Amol/L),
N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU; 7 mmol/L), cisplatin (0.5 mmol/L), MMC
(3 Amol/L), camptothecin (2.5 Amol/L), ICRF-193 (2.25 Amol/L), hydroxyurea (250 Amol/L), aphidicolin (1 Amol/L), 6-thioguanine (10 nmol/L), and
trichostatin A (TSA; 1 Amol/L). After 4 h of exposure, cells were collected
and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L
EDTA (pH 8.0), 120 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP40] plus appropriate amount of
protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Cell lysates containing 20 to 50 Ag of
protein were subjected to 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer
of resolved protein to nylon membrane. After blocking with nonfat milk
(5%) in TBST buffer [Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20],
the membrane was incubated with the corresponding primary and
secondary antibodies (7). The immune complex on the membrane was
detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech).
For immunostaining, HeLa cells were seeded at about 20% to 30%
confluence on the chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International Corp.). After
48 h, cells were rinsed with PBS once and then fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (dissolved in PBS) by incubating at room temperature
for 10 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.3%

Triton X-100 in TBST for 10 min at room temperature. Following
permeabilization, the cells were blocked with the blocking buffer (5% nonfat
milk in TBST) for 1 to 2 h at room temperature, and primary antibody
(mouse anti-serum, 1:1,000 dilution) was subsequently incorporated to
continue incubation for 1 h at room temperature. On the completion of
primary antibody incubation, the cells were washed thrice with TBST and
then incubated with blocking buffer containing a fluorescent-labeled
secondary antibody [working dilution, 1:5,000; Alexa Fluor 488 F(ab¶)2
fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Molecular Probes] for 1 h at room
temperature. After rinse with TBST for three to four times, one drop of 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)–containing mounting medium (Vectashield mounting medium, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) was added to the culture
slide, and a coverslip was placed on top of the mounting medium. The cells
were immediately observed under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope.
Dose response, time course, and pulse chase. Dose response:
HeLa cells were seeded at 50% confluency. Next day, 100, 200, 300, 400,
and 500 Amol/L of cisplatin and DMSO (corresponding to highest dose of
cisplatin) were added for 4 h. Time course: HeLa cells were seeded at
50% confluency and next day, 500 Amol/L cisplatin was added for 5, 10, 15,
20, 40, and 60 min. Pulse chase: HeLa cells were seeded at 50% confluency
and next day, 500 Amol/L cisplatin was added for 1 h. Then, cells were
washed twice in PBS and then new medium was added for 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 12,
and 17 h.
After cisplatin exposure for any of these experiments, cells were collected
and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmol/L
EDTA (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 10% glycerol] plus appropriate
amount of protease inhibitor cocktails. Cell lysates containing 20 to 50
(25) Ag of protein were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by
electrotransfer of resolved protein to nylon membrane. After blocking with
nonfat milk (5%) in TBST buffer [Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1%
Tween 20], the membrane was incubated with the corresponding primary
and secondary antibodies. The immune complex on the membrane was
detected using an ECL kit.
Analysis of human cancer-derived cells. HEC59 and HEC59+chromosome 2 [a gift from Dr. Thomas Kunkel (National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC)] were cultured as described
(27). HeLa (ATCC), HCT116 (ATCC), and LoVo cells (ATCC) were cultured
according to ATCC’s instructions. Cells were seeded at 50% confluency.
Next day, 500 Amol/L cisplatin or DMSO (solvent) was added for 4 h.
Immunoblotting was done as described for the dose response, time course,
and pulse chase in HeLa cells.
Generation of targeting vector. The TREX2 targeting vector was
constructed by amplifying left (5¶) and right (3¶) arms using genomic DNA
extracted from AB2.2 ES cells (derived from a 129S6/SvEv mouse) by highfidelity PCR using iProof DNA polymerase (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Reactions
were done in 20 AL reaction volume containing 4 AL of 5 iProof HF buffer,
0.4 AL of 10 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 0.25 AL of 4 Amol/L
forward or reverse primers (below), 100 ng of genomic DNA, and 0.4 AL of
iProof DNA polymerase. The gradient PCR condition is set as follows: 1 cycle of
98jC for 5 min; 30 cycles of 98jC for 1 min ! 64.5jC for 1 min with 15jC
gradient ! 72jC for 1 to 3 min; and 1 cycle of 72jC for 10 min. After
amplification, the left arm was cut with Sal1 and Not1 and cloned into a
plasmid backbone cut with Xho1 and Not1. Then, the right arm was cut with
Xho1 and Not1 and cloned into the same backbone adjacent to the left arm. The
entire known mouse TREX2 coding sequence is deleted. Then, the floxed HPRT
minigene was cloned into unique Sfi1 sites as described previously (28). The left
(5¶) arm primers were the following: 5¶-AAAACGCGTCGACAAGGGAGAGATTAATAGGTGTGGAAGGGAGATAGCAAACAGG-3¶ (mTrxLR5) and 5¶-AAAAGGAAAAGCGGCCGCGGCCACTAAGGCCACAATGAGGCCTAGAGCTGCCAGAACAAGTGGCATAAGC-3¶ (mTrxLR31). The right (3¶) arm primers were the
following: 5¶-AAAAGGAAAAGCGGC CGCGGC CTGCGTGGCCTACAGCCTTCTCTGTACTCCACTATCAGTTGGGCACCTTC-3¶ (mTrxRR51) and
5¶-TACTTTTAAACTCGAGCTGAGCAAGTCAATATACATTTGTAACCCTAGTACTG-3¶ (mTrxRR31).
Generation and detection of targeted clones. AB2.2 ES cells were
maintained in M15 [[high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 15% fetal bovine
serum, 100 Amol/L h-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmol/L glutathione, 3 mg/mL

inhibitory factor (LIF)]] and grown on plates with 2.5  106 g-irradiated
murine embryonic fibroblasts (mitotically inactive feeders) seeded on 0.1%
gelatin-coated plastic at least the day before and grown in 5% CO2 in a 37jC
incubator at atmospheric O2. About 10 Ag PacI-linearized DNA was mixed
with 5  106 AB2.2 ES cells in 800 AL PBS. DNA:ES cell mixture was
transferred to an electroporation cuvette (Gene Pulser cuvettes, 0.4 cm
electrode gap, 10; Bio-Rad Laboratories) and then electroporated at 230 V and
500 AF (Gene Pulser apparatus, Bio-Rad). After electroporation, cells were
seeded onto two 10-cm plates with feeders. Next day, M15 medium containing
1 hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT; 0.1 mmol/L hypoxanthine,
0.0004 mmol/L aminopterin, and 0.016 mmol/L thymidine) was added. After
5 to 7 days of HAT selection, resistant colonies were picked onto a 96-well
plate and maintained in HAT selection. After 5 days, these cells were
replicated onto gelatin-coated plates. Cells were frozen back on one plate and
allowed to proliferate on the other plate for about 5 days. This plate was used
to isolate genomic DNA using the microextraction procedure (29). Targeted
ES cell clones were screened by genomic PCR for correct gene targeting.
Primers to detect left arm integration were TX2 LR55 (outside of left arm)

5 min followed by 35 rounds of 98jC for 1 min, 72jC for 1 min, and 72jC for
2 min and 30 s followed by 1 round of 72jC for 10 min. Primers to detect right

35 rounds of 98jC for 1 min, 63.5jC for 1 min, and 72jC for 2 min and 30 s
followed by 1 round of 72jC for 10 min. Primers to confirm deletion of TREX2
open reading frame (ORF) were 5¶-AAAAGAATTCCCGCCACCATGTCTGAGCCACCCCGGGC-3¶ (mTX2For) and 5¶-AAAACTCGAGTCAGGCTTCGAGGCTTGGACC-3¶ (mTX2Rev), under the following conditions: 1 round

and 72jC for 25 s followed by 1 round of 72jC for 10 min. Ku80 primers used
to control for loading of genomic DNA were 5¶-GAGAGTCTACGACAACTGTGC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AGAGGGACTGCAGCCATATTA-3¶ (reverse), under the following conditions: 1 round of 98jC for 5 min followed
by 35 rounds of 98jC for 1 min, 59jC for 1 min, and 72jC for 30 s followed by
1 round of 72jC for 10 min. Rad51 primers used to control for loading of

cDNA were 5¶-CACACCATGGCTATGCAAATGCAGCTTG-3¶ (mRAD51For)
and 5¶-CACACTCGAGTCAAGAGTCATAGATTTTGCAGATTC-3¶ (mRAD51Rev), under the following conditions: 1 round of 98jC for 5 min followed
by 35 rounds of 98jC for 1 min, 65jC for 1 min, and 72jC for 40 s followed by
1 round of 72jC for 10 min.
Delete the 5¶ half of the HPRT minigene. This procedure was done as
described previously (28). Briefly, targeted ES cells were grown without
HAT for 4 days and then 5  106 cells were electroporated with 20 Ag
Cre expression vector in a total of 800 AL and 200 AL of the electroporation
were plated onto a 10-cm feeder plate. Again, cells were grown for 4 days
in the absence of selection. After 4 days, cells were trypsinized and 2  104
cells were plated onto a 10-cm plate with 6-thioguanine (6-TG) selection
medium (10 Amol/L). 6-TG-resistant colonies were picked 10 to 14 days
later and expanded for PCR analysis using primers Cre1 and Cre2:

Figure 2. Targeting TREX2 in mouse ES cells. The HPRT minigene, expressed by
the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter (34, 41), is used for selection
and contains exons 1 and 2 (box labeled 1 & 2) and exons 3 to 8 + polyadenylation
sequences (box labeled 3–8) separated by an intron (straight line). Select for
minigene expression in HAT. A RE mutant loxP (arrowhead; ref. 42) is 5¶ to
phosphoglycerol kinase and another RE mutant loxP is in the intron. Sfi1 sites
(GGCCNNNNNGGCC) flank this cassette that permit sticky directional cloning
because this site generates noncomplementary overhangs. We consistently use
two Sfi1 sites called Sfia (GGCCTTAGTGGCC) and Sfib (GGCCTGCGTGGCC);
thus, selection cassettes can be readily replaced (important for knock-in). A, deleting
the entire known mouse TREX2 ORF (black rectangle); this sequence corresponds
to the human short isoform (7). Transfected cells are selected in HAT and targeted
clones are screened by PCR (described in Materials and Methods). Two trex2null
(tx2null ) clones (2E1 and 2F7) are shown. Integration of the left arm (LA) is detected
with TX2 LR55 and HATrev primers and integration of the right arm (RA) is
detected with HATfor and TX2 RR33 primers. The mouse TREX2 coding sequence
is detected with mTX2For and mTX2Rev. Ku80 is a control to ensure DNA
loading. To verify mouse TREX2 mRNA is absent, these trex2null (tx2null ) clones are
further tested by RT-PCR (right). Rad51 is used as a positive control to ensure
RNA loading. B, removal of the 5¶ half of the HPRT minigene by Cre-mediated
recombination. Transiently transfect a Cre expression vector and select in
6-thioguanine (6-TG). 6-Thioguanine (6-TG)–resistant clones were screen for
deletion by PCR using primers Cre1 and Cre2. C, introduction of the short isoform
of human TREX2 cDNA (hTREX2; gray box; ref. 7) into a clone of trex2null cells
(2F7). Knock-in of human TREX2 is verified by PCR (left) using TX2 LR55 and
hTX2Rev primers for the left arm and this amplified sequence is confirmed by EcoR1
restriction digest [uncut (uc)]. Expression of human TREX2 is confirmed by RT-PCR
(right) using primers unique to human TREX2 (hTX2For and hTX2Rev) and
mouse TREX2 cDNA (mTX2For and mTX2 Rev). Rad51 (R51) is used as a loading
control. RT, reverse transcriptase.

Cisplatin Depletes the Trex2 Exonuclease

Results and Discussion
Cisplatin reduces cytosolic TREX2. Human TREX2 levels were
measured after exposure to a variety of genotoxic agents in HeLa
cells (human cervix adenocarcinoma cells from ATCC) to test if it
is important for DNA repair because TREX2 displays properties,
suggesting that it plays such a role (3¶!5¶ exonuclease activity,
forms nuclear foci and facilitates cellular proliferation; ref. 7). By
Western blot, we find that TREX2 is depleted after 4 h of exposure
to 500 Amol/L cisplatin, a DNA cross-linking agent (Fig. 1A), and by
immunofluorescence, we find that TREX2 nuclear foci disappear
(Fig. 1B). However, under the conditions tested, TREX2 levels
remain unchanged after exposure to other genotoxins including
another cross-linking agent, MMC. Thus, chemical depletion of
TREX2 seems to be unique to cisplatin.
We next measured the dynamics of cisplatin-mediated TREX2
depletion in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). The concentration of cisplatin
required to deplete TREX2 was measured after 4 h of exposure.
A concentration of 300 Amol/L is insufficient to deplete
TREX2, whereas 400 Amol/L cisplatin depletes most TREX2 and
500 Amol/L cisplatin depletes all TREX2 as visualized by Western
blot. The time required for 500 Amol/L cisplatin to deplete TREX2
was measured. TREX2 levels diminish after 5 min and are
completely gone after 60 min. The time required for TREX2 levels
to recover was measured after 1-h exposure to 500 Amol/L
cisplatin. After a 1-h pulse, TREX2 levels begin to recover by 5 h and
are completely reestablished after 12 h. These results show that a 1h exposure to 500 Amol/L cisplatin is required to deplete TREX2. In
addition, cisplatin-induced TREX2 depletion is reversible after 5 to
12 h. Therefore, physiologically relevant concentrations of cisplatin
are sufficient to quickly deplete TREX2 because f10% of HeLa
cells are viable after 6 days of exposure to 400 Amol/L cisplatin (31).
We next determined if cisplatin depletes TREX2 in other human
cancer-derived cells: LoVo (colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial
cells from ATCC), HEC59 (endometrial tumor cells defective for
MSH2; ref. 27), HEC59+chromosome 2 (MSH2 complemented; ref.
32), and HCT116 (colon cancer epithelial cells defective for MLH1
from ATCC). Previously, we showed that TREX2 is expressed in
most human cancer-derived cell lines, suggesting that it has a
common cellular function (7). Similar to HeLa cells, 4-h exposure
to 500 Amol/L cisplatin depletes TREX2 for these other cell lines
(Fig. 1D). Therefore, cisplatin depletion of TREX2 seems to occur in
a variety of human cancer-derived cell lines. In addition, loss of
mismatch repair proteins like MLH1 can result in resistance to

cisplatin (33); thus, cisplatin reduces TREX2 in cells that are
mismatch repair defective and resistant to cisplatin.
Cisplatin is an interstrand DNA cross-linker and ICLs are known
to cause DSBs at replication forks (2) that are toxic to proliferating
cells. Now, we show that cisplatin effectively reduces cytosolic
TREX2; therefore, TREX2 depletion could also contribute to the
cytotoxicity of cisplatin assuming that TREX2 is important for
cellular viability and genome maintenance. This assumption seems
possible because TREX2 has 3¶!5¶ exonuclease activity, forms
nuclear foci, and facilitates cellular proliferation, suggesting that it
is important for chromosomal maintenance (7).
TREX2 facilitates proliferation and suppresses RbTs. The
TREX2 coding sequence was deleted in mouse ES cells (AB2.2) by
gene targeting (Fig. 2A) to determine if cisplatin-induced TREX2
depletion causes a similar phenotype as genetic TREX2 deletion. A
single exon that contains the entire known mouse coding sequence
was replaced with the HPRT minigene (34); this coding sequence
corresponds to the human short isoform (7). TREX2-targeted clones
are hemizygous null because it is located on the X chromosome and
because AB2.2 ES cells are XY. These mutated cells are called
trex2null and two mutant clones are analyzed: 2E1 and 2F7.
The short isoform of the human cDNA (7) is targeted back into
trex2null cells (clone 2F7) by a two-step process (there is 89.8%
identity between these human and mouse proteins). The first step
removes the 5¶ half of the HPRT minigene by Cre-mediated recombination and selection in 6-thioguanine (Fig. 2B; ref. 28). The second
step targets the human TREX2 cDNAs back into these trex2null cells
positioning it adjacent to the mouse TREX2 promoter (Fig. 2C).
These humanized clones express the short isoform of human TREX2
(7) and are called Trex2hTX2 (three clones are analyzed).
TREX2 is likely important for cellular proliferation because,
previously, we showed that RNA interference knockdown of TREX2
decreased cellular proliferation in HeLa cells (7). Here, we confirm
this observation in mouse ES cells because both trex2null clones
exhibit slower proliferation than control cells and because this
phenotype is partially rescued by expression of human TREX2
(Fig. 3). Thus, TREX2 depletion impairs cellular proliferation in
both mouse ES cells and in human HeLa cells.
We observed metaphase spreads by three-color fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify gross chromosomal
rearrangements (GCR) for control and trex2null cells (Fig. 4; Table 1).
These cells were treated with 10 mg colcemide for 4 h and
stained with a subtelomere probe (green), a MSR probe in the

pericentromere (red), and DAPI (blue; ref. 35). About 0.25% of
control metaphase spreads compared with 16% of trex2null
metaphase spreads exhibit spontaneous RbTs (P < 0.0001, Fisher’s
exact test on binomial data; Fig. 4A; see Supplementary Table S1 for
absolute numbers and summary of statistical analysis). RbTs are
chromosome rearrangements that involve the centric fusion of two
acrocentric chromosomes to form a single metacentric chromosome (36) and are known to increase cancer risk (37), spontaneous
abortions (38), and male infertility (39). These RbTs do not contain
telomeres at the fusion site as observed by two-color FISH (only
DAPI and the telomere probe were used; Fig. 4B). RbTs are not due
to a single event that was subsequently expanded within the
population of cells because they are found in both clones at equal
frequency (Supplementary Table S1). Additionally, expression of
human TREX2 in trex2null cells significantly decreases RbT levels to
f1.8% (P = 0.042, Fisher’s exact test on binomial data; Table 1;
Supplementary Table S1).
In addition to three-color FISH, SKY was done to more completely
evaluate trex2null cells for GCRs (Fig. 5; Table 1; Supplementary
Table S1). In 16 control metaphase spreads, we observed three
deletions but no duplications or translocations. In 29 metaphase
spreads prepared from trex2null cells, we detected 9 deletions,
7 duplications, and 3 translocations. Thus, there are a total of 3 GCRs
for 16 control metaphase spreads compared with 19 GCRs for
29 trex2null metaphase spreads (P = 0.0463, Fisher’s exact test on
binomial data). Excluding deletions, there are no GCRs for 16 control
metaphase spreads compared with 10 GCRs for 29 trex2null
metaphase spreads (P = 0.0080, Fisher’s exact test on binomial

data). These GCRs include a RbT (11:11; Fig. 5A), a duplication of
chromosome 11 (Fig. 5B) and chromosome 12 (Fig. 5C), and two
reciprocal translocations [t(5E; 10C) (10C; 5E) (Fig. 5D) and t(12E;
18D) (18D; 12E); data not shown]. Thus, both three-color FISH and
SKY identify RbTs and SKY additionally identifies other GCRs that
are difficult to observe by three-color FISH. These data show that
TREX2 maintains genomic stability by suppressing GCRs and
suggest that responses to DNA damage reduce proliferation for
trex2null cells as shown in Fig. 3.
Cisplatin, but not MMC, induces RbTs. To determine if
cisplatin-induced TREX2 depletion results in a TREX2-null
phenotype, WT AB2.2 ES cells were exposed for 5 to 10 h to
250 Amol/L cisplatin or 100 nmol/L MMC and then exposed for 4
h to 10 mg colcemide so that metaphase spreads may be evaluated
for RbTs by three-color FISH (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1).
We find that RbTs are rare (0.25%) for unexposed AB2.2 cells
(Fig. 4C). However, RbTs increase by 15-fold (3.7%) after exposure
to cisplatin (P = 0.0003, Fisher’s exact test on binomial data;
Fig. 4D), but not MMC (P < 0.0001, comparing the number of RbTs
for AB2.2 cells exposed to either cisplatin or MMC). The total
number of RbTs decreases in trex2null cells after exposure to either
cisplatin or MMC such that the incidence of RbTs is about the
same as WT cells exposed to cisplatin (Table 1; Supplementary
Table S1). Previously, cross-linking agents were shown to disrupt
RbTs, suggesting that the fusion site is structurally fragile (40); thus,
these data suggest that cisplatin-induced TREX2 depletion induces
RbTs, whereas both cisplatin and MMC disrupt RbTs such that the
total number of RbTs rests in the balance.
Conclusion. We show that TREX2 is depleted after exposure to
cisplatin in human cancer-derived cell lines. Cisplatin-induced
TREX2 depletion seems to cause a TREX2-null phenotype because
cisplatin-exposed cells exhibit RbTs as do cells deleted for TREX2
by gene targeting. In addition, we show that TREX2 is important
for efficient cellular proliferation and for maintaining genomic
stability by suppressing GCRs. Thus, cisplatin may have two
cytotoxic modes of action to inhibit cellular proliferation and
induce genomic instability: (a) ICL generation and (b) TREX2
depletion.
