ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western
societies. This poor prognosis is due to chemotherapeutic drug resistance and
metastatic spread. Evidence suggests that microtubule proteins namely, β-tubulins
are dysregulated in tumor cells and are involved in regulating chemosensitivity.
However, the role of β-tubulins in pancreatic cancer are unknown. We measured
the expression of different β-tubulin isotypes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue
and pancreatic cancer cells. Next, we used RNAi to silence βIII-tubulin expression
in pancreatic cancer cells, and measured cell growth in the absence and presence of
chemotherapeutic drugs. Finally, we assessed the role of βIII-tubulin in regulating
tumor growth and metastases using an orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse model.
We found that βIII-tubulin is highly expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue
and pancreatic cancer cells. Further, we demonstrated that silencing βIII-tubulin
expression reduced pancreatic cancer cell growth and tumorigenic potential in the
absence and presence of chemotherapeutic drugs. Finally, we demonstrated that
suppression of βIII-tubulin reduced tumor growth and metastases in vivo. Our novel
data demonstrate that βIII-tubulin is a key player in promoting pancreatic cancer
growth and survival, and silencing its expression may be a potential therapeutic
strategy to increase the long-term survival of pancreatic cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

that silencing βIII-tubulin in pancreatic cancer cells in
vitro 1) decreases clonogenicity; 2) decreases anchoragedependent and independent proliferation; 3) increases
apoptosis and anoikis; and 4) increases sensitivity to
chemotherapy drugs including gemcitabine and the TBAs
paclitaxel and vincristine. Notably, we demonstrate the
importance of βIII-tubulin in regulating tumor growth and
metastases in a clinically-relevant orthotopic pancreatic
cancer mouse model.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a
devastating disease that ranks as the fourth leading
cause of cancer-related death in Western societies, with
a 5-year survival rate of 6-7% [1-5]. This poor prognosis
is due to PDA’s propensity to acquire resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents and metastasize [8, 9]. The
result is that our current chemotherapeutic treatments
only extend patient survival by ∼8–16 weeks [10]. These
statistics highlight the imperative to identify effective
therapeutic targets for this devastating disease.
The tubulin/microtubule network is recognized as a
key player in cancer chemoresistance [11]. Microtubules
are tube-like assemblies of α-and β-tubulin heterodimers,
that form part of the cell cytoskeleton and play critical
roles in regulating mitosis and intracellular transport [11].
β-tubulin has seven different isotypes (βI, βII, βIII, βIVa,
βIVb, βV, βVI) that exhibit distinct tissue expression
profiles [11]. Notably, all of the β-tubulin isotypes share
a high degree of homology and are distinguished by
their unique carboxy terminal tail which is subject to
post-translational modifications [11]. The importance
of microtubules as therapeutic targets for cancer is
highlighted by the clinical use of tubulin binding agents
(TBAs) which target β-tubulin. At high concentrations
these agents induce mitotic arrest and cause cell death
[12]. However, therapeutic applications of TBAs are
often marred by resistance, which is often correlated to
differential expression of specific β-tubulin isotypes [11].
Clinical studies have reported high expression of βIIItubulin in several cancers including lung, breast, prostate,
gastric and melanoma [13-18]. Under non-pathological
conditions βIII-tubulin expression is primarily restricted
to neurons, and sertoli cells in the testis, and at low levels
in other tissues [19, 20]. Interestingly, its upregulation in
cancer cells has been correlated to decreased progressionfree or overall survival and resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents [21]. Functional studies have confirmed the
importance of βIII-tubulin in regulating sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic agents in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), ovarian cancer and prostate cancer cells [2225].
Up-regulation of βIII-tubulin has been observed in
advanced PDA patient tissue specimens and cell lines [26].
Interestingly, aberrant βIII-tubulin expression in PDA
cells was associated with activation of kRAS (oncogene
commonly associated with PDA) and appeared to be
progressively upregulated in pancreatic intraepithelial
neoplasias (PanIN) 1 to 3, the precursor lesions of PDA
[26]. Despite this strong correlation, no functional role
for βIII-tubulin has been established in pancreatic cancer.
Using a gene-silencing approach we silenced βIII-tubulin
expression in pancreatic cancer cells and determined
its role in regulating chemosensitivity, cell growth,
tumorigenesis and metastases. We report for the first time

RESULTS
βIII-tubulin is expressed in human pancreatic
tumor cells
βIII-tubulin was expressed at high levels in
pancreatic tumor cells, while absent in the acinar and
normal ductal cells in PDA tissue (Figure 1A). To
determine whether the expression pattern was specific
to βIII-tubulin, we also examined the levels of another
β-tubulin isotype, βII-tubulin, which has been shown to be
differentially expressed in tumor cells [27-29]. It too was
present at high levels in pancreatic tumor cells, however
in contrast to βIII-tubulin, it was also present in acinar and
normal ductal cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Next, we
measured βIII-tubulin expression by western blotting in
cell lysates from 3 different pancreatic cancer cell lines
derived from primary (MiaPaCa-2, Panc-1) and metastatic
(HPAF-II) sites. βIII-tubulin levels were significantly
higher in all 3 pancreatic cancer cell lines compared
to normal non-tumorigenic human pancreatic ductal
epithelial (HPDE) cells (Figure 1B). βII-tubulin was also
higher in 2/3 pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2 and
Panc-1) compared to HPDE cells (Figure 1B). Notably, βItubulin, which is constitutively expressed in most tissues,
was expressed at similar levels in the pancreatic cancer
cell lines and the normal HPDE cells (Figure 1B).

Potent and specific knockdown of βIII-tubulin in
pancreatic cancer cells
To examine whether βIII-tubulin could be
suppressed in pancreatic cancer cells, we transfected
two-independent pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2
and HPAF-II) with βIII-tubulin siRNA. 48h and 72h
post transfection, βIII-tubulin expression was measured.
Knockdown of βIII-tubulin was observed at the gene
level in both cell lines (MiaPaCa-2, 84.4 ± 2.6% knockdown; HPAF-II, 76.8 ± 1.1% knock-down relative to
control-siRNA; 72h post-transfection) (Figure 2A and B).
This correlated to knockdown (>90%) of βIII-tubulin at
the protein level (Figure 2A and B). Knockdown of βIItubulin was also observed when pancreatic cancer cells
(MiaPaCa-2 and HPAF-II) were treated with βII-tubulin

siRNA (Supplementary Figure 2).
To confirm that knockdown of βIII-tubulin was
specific and did not cause compensational changes in the
expression of other major β-tubulin isotypes, MiaPaCa-2
cells were transfected with βIII-tubulin siRNA and 72h
later the levels of total β-tubulin, βI-tubulin and βIItubulin were measured. No change in the expression of
the above β-tubulins were observed following βIII-tubulin
silencing (Figure 2C).

βIII-tubulin expression on the clonogenic potential of
pancreatic cancer cells in the absence or presence of
chemotherapeutic drugs. Silencing βIII-tubulin in the
absence of chemotherapy significantly reduced the ability
of pancreatic cancer cells (MiaPaCa-2 and HPAF-II) to
form colonies compared to controls (Figures 3A and 3D).
Moreover, the number of pancreatic cancer cell colonies
was further decreased in the presence of the chemotherapy
agents paclitaxel, vincristine, and gemcitabine (used
in the first-line treatment of pancreatic cancer) when
compared to controls (ns-siRNA) (Figures 3A-3F). In
contrast, silencing βII-tubulin had no effect on pancreatic
cancer cell colony formation in the absence or presence
of chemotherapy drugs (Supplementary Figure 3A-3F).
Silencing βIII-tubulin or βII-tubulin had no effect on cell
viability or growth of normal non-tumorigenic HPDE cells
(Supplementary Figure 4A and B). This suggests that βIII-

βIII-tubulin silencing decreases clonogenicity and
increases sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in
pancreatic cancer cells
To establish the functional role of βIII-tubulin in
pancreatic cancer, we determined the effect of silencing

tubulin may have a specific functional role in pancreatic
cancer cells.
To determine whether silencing βIII-tubulin would
affect the structure of the microtubule cytoskeleton of
pancreatic cancer cells, MiaPaCa-2 and HPAF-II cells
were transfected with βIII-tubulin- or control siRNA, and
stained with fluorescent antibodies against total α-tubulin
(red) to visualize the microtubule cytoskeleton and βIIItubulin (green). Suppression of βIII-tubulin, did not affect
the structural integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton
(Figure 4A and 4B).
Next, we examined whether the increased
sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to TBAs (paclitaxel
and vincristine) following silencing of βIII-tubulin was
due to increased disruption of mitosis. MiaPaCa-2 and
HPAF-II cells were transfected with βIII-tubulin siRNA
and then treated with increasing concentrations of

paclitaxel (microtubule-stabilizing agent) or vincristine
(microtubule-destabilizing agent) and their cell cycle
measured. We observed increased accumulation of both
control (ns-siRNA) and βIII-tubulin-siRNA treated cells
in G2/M phase, along with a corresponding decrease in
G0/G1 phase with increasing concentrations of paclitaxel
(Figure 4C) and vincristine (Figure 4D). However, βIIItubulin knockdown did not markedly affect cell cycle
distribution, relative to controls (ns-siRNA; Figure 4CD), suggesting that the decreased clonogenic potential of
βIII-tubulin knockdown cells in the absence or presence of
TBAs was not due to enhanced disruption of the cell cycle.

βIII-tubulin silencing induces apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cells

a role for βIII-tubulin in regulating cell survival in tumor
cells in the absence of chemical and /or environmental
stress.

To investigate whether apoptosis was responsible
for the reduction in the number of pancreatic cancer cell
colonies, MiaPaCa-2 cells were transfected with βIIItubulin or control siRNA (ns-siRNA) and then treated with
or without chemotherapy drugs. βIII-tubulin suppression
in pancreatic cancer cells induced a marked increase in
apoptosis (Annexin V and 7AAD) in the absence of
chemotherapy drugs (Figure 5A-F). This was echoed
by a significant increase in caspase 3/7 activity, in βIIItubulin knockdown cells (Figure 5D-F). Furthermore,
the increase in apoptosis was sustained in the presence of
chemotherapy drugs (Figure 5D-F). These data suggest
that the decreased clonogenic potential in pancreatic
cancer cells is mediated via increased apoptosis. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first report to demonstrate

βIII-tubulin silencing reduces the tumorigenic
potential of pancreatic cancer cells
Our drug-clonogenic and apoptosis results suggested
that βIII-tubulin might be playing a survival role in
pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated the
effect of βIII-tubulin suppression on pancreatic cancer
cell anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, as
well as anoikis (anchorage-independent programmed
cell death). Tumor cells with high tumorigenic and
metastatic potential have acquired mechanisms to
grow and survive under both anchorage-dependent and
independent conditions, and develop mechanisms to
resist anoikis. First, anchorage-dependent cell growth was

Consistent with our drug-clonogenic results, we observed
significantly reduced cell proliferation in MiaPaCa-2 cells
transfected with βIII-tubulin siRNA relative to controls

(ns-siRNA) over 48h (Figure 6A). Next, we assessed the
effects of βIII-tubulin knockdown on pancreatic cancer

Stable suppression of βIII-tubulin reduces tumor
growth and metastases in an orthotopic murine
model of pancreatic cancer

or control siRNA (ns-siRNA) and then grown in softagar for 14 days. Knockdown of βIII-tubulin significantly
reduced the number of cell colonies formed (Figure 6B
and 6C). Finally, to investigate whether the reduction
in cell colonies was in part due to anoikis, MiaPaCa-2
cells transfected with control or βIII-tubulin siRNA were
cultured in suspension for 48h. We observed a significant
increase in the apoptotic fraction of MiaPaCa-2 cells with
knockdown of βIII-tubulin (Figure 6D). Collectively, these
results provide strong evidence that βIII-tubulin plays an
important role in promoting the growth and metastatic
potential of pancreatic cancer cells.

To extend our findings in vivo, we generated
MiaPaCa-2 cells that stably expressed luciferase and a
βIII-tubulin shRNA construct. Cells stably expressing
the same construct but with a non-functional shRNA (nsshRNA) served as controls. These cells possessed potent
knockdown of βIII-tubulin compared to control shRNA
cells (Supplementary Figure 5A and 5B). Notably, cells
with stable suppression of βIII-tubulin had a significant

decrease in anchorage-independent growth when
compared to controls (ns-shRNA) (Figure 7A). These
results concurred with our data using transient knockdown
of βIII-tubulin (Figure 6B). Cells were implanted into the
pancreas of mice, and allowed to grow for 8 weeks before
tumors along with the spleen, liver, kidneys, intestines,
and heart/lungs were harvested together with any lymph
nodes that exhibited signs of metastases. βIII-tubulin
knockdown in the tumors (8 weeks post implantation)
containing βIII-tubulin shRNA was confirmed (Figures
7B-7D). Pancreatic tumors expressing βIII-tubulin shRNA
had significantly reduced tumor volume relative to control
shRNA tumors (Control: 145.0 ± 30.5 mm3, βIII-Tubulin
shRNA: 80.6 ± 21.9 mm3, p<0.05; Figure 8A-B). The
incidence of metastases was reduced by 30% in mice

with tumors expressing βIII-tubulin shRNA (4/10 mice
had metastases) versus tumors expressing control shRNA
(7/10 mice had metastases). Metastases that were detected
by ex vivo imaging of individual organs on a Xenogen
IVIS platform (Supplementary Figure 6A) were found to
be reduced by 62.5% in the βIII-tubulin shRNA pancreatic
tumors, relative to controls (Figure 8C-D). Metastases
detected by ex vivo imaging were confirmed by histology
(Supplementary Figure 6B) and immunohistochemistry
(Supplementary Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic cancer is chemoresistant and metastatic,
making this a lethal cancer. There is mounting evidence to

tumor growth and metastases in vivo.
In health, βIII-tubulin expression is restricted
to neuronal tissue and testicular sertoli cells [19, 20].
However, clinical studies report high levels of βIIItubulin in different tumors including breast, lung, ovarian,
gastric and melanoma [13-18]. Recently, high βIII-tubulin
expression was reported in prostate cancer, and was linked
to high Gleason grade, advanced tumor stage and local

show that βIII-tubulin is dysregulated in tumor cells, and
its increased expression is correlated to poor survival [3033]. However, the role of βIII-tubulin in pancreatic cancer
is unknown. We report novel functions for βIII-tubulin
in regulating pancreatic cancer cell growth and survival
in the absence and presence of chemotherapeutic drugs.
In addition, we demonstrate that silencing βIII-tubulin
expression in pancreatic cancer cells results in reduced

metastases [31]. In this study we demonstrated that βIIItubulin was expressed at high levels in pancreatic tumor
cells, while absent in the acinar and normal pancreatic
ducts in tissue specimens collected after surgical resection.
We also showed increased expression of βIII-tubulin in
pancreatic cancer cell lines compared to primary cultures
of HPDE cells. Our results are in accordance with a study
by Lee et al. [26], which reported βIII-tubulin expression
in advanced PDA tissue samples. However, prior to the
present study, there have been no studies to elucidate its
functional role.
Using RNAi we demonstrated that silencing βIIItubulin in pancreatic cancer cells reduced their ability to
form cell colonies. Moreover, the number of colonies was
further reduced when the cells were treated with different

chemotherapy drugs including, the anti-metabolite
gemcitabine (used in the first-line treatment of pancreatic
cancer) and the TBAs paclitaxel and vincristine [albumin
bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) is now used in the clinic
to treat pancreatic cancer and vincristine while not a
pancreatic cancer treatment, was used in this study to
help delineate βIII-tubulin’s function]. Knockdown of
βII-tubulin, which was also overexpressed in pancreatic
cancer cells, had no effect on the clonogenic potential
of pancreatic cancer cells in the absence or presence of
chemotherapy drugs. This result is in contrast to a previous
study in NSCLC cells which showed that silencing βIItubulin expression increased sensitivity to Vinca alkaloids
(25). Therefore, it is possible that the ability of pancreatic
cancer cells to form colonies in the absence or presence

of chemotherapy drugs may be β-tubulin isotype specific.
Moreover, βIII-tubulin appears to have a tumor cellspecific effect as silencing its expression in normal HPDE
cells had no effect on their cell viability or proliferation.
A role for β-tubulin isotypes in regulating
chemosensitivity in tumor cells has been described. Gan
et al. [22] showed that silencing βIII-tubulin in NSCLC
cells reduced their clonogenic capacity in the presence
of chemotherapy. This finding was extended to an in
vivo setting by McCarroll et al. [24], which reported
that stable suppression of βIII-tubulin in NSCLC cells
increased survival in mice when treated with cisplatin.
More recently, βIII-tubulin was shown to be involved
in regulating docetaxel sensitivity in castrate-resistant
prostate cancer cells [31]. Interestingly, Gan et al. [28]
reported that suppression of βII- or βIVb-tubulin in
NSCLC cells increased sensitivity to only one class of
chemotherapy drugs known as Vinca Alkaloids. These
studies reinforce the concept that individual β-tubulin
isotypes may have specific functional roles in tumor cells,
with βIII-tubulin appearing to be important in regulating
sensitivity to broad classes of chemotherapy drugs.
However, despite the increasing number of studies that
highlight the importance of βIII-tubulin in tumor cells, its
mode of action has yet to be fully determined.
In an attempt to understand how βIII-tubulin is
exerting its effect on pancreatic cancer cells we first
examined whether silencing its expression influenced the
structural integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton, given
the importance of microtubule proteins in regulating
the shape and structure of cells. Silencing βIII-tubulin
expression in pancreatic cancer cells had no effect on
the structure of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Next, we
assessed whether silencing βIII-tubulin impacted the
cell cycle given the importance of microtubule proteins
in regulating mitosis. No significant effect on the cell
cycle was observed. We also showed that silencing βIIItubulin did not potentiate the anti-mitotic effect of TBAs
in pancreatic cancer cells. Together, these results indicate
that the observed decrease in the clonogenic potential of
pancreatic cancer cells with suppressed βIII-tubulin in the
absence or presence of chemotherapeutic drugs does not
involve modulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton or the
cell cycle.
Finally, to determine whether this decrease in
the clonogenic potential of pancreatic cancer cells with
suppressed βIII-tubulin was due to increased sensitivity
to cell death, we measured apoptosis in pancreatic cancer
cells. We demonstrated that silencing βIII-tubulin induced
cell death in pancreatic cancer cells which was sustained
in the presence of chemotherapy. It appeared that the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway was involved as evidenced
by increased caspase 3/7 activity. This is the first study to
report a significant induction of apoptosis in tumor cells
with suppressed βIII-tubulin in the absence of cellular
stress. Previously, induction of apoptosis in tumor cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with knockdown of βIII-tubulin was observed only when
cells were treated with chemotherapeutic drugs [22,
24]. Therefore, it appears that pancreatic cancer cells
are highly sensitive to suppression of βIII-tubulin, and
that this protein may provide these cells with a survival
advantage. Indeed, evidence in other cell types suggest
that βIII-tubulin may be part of a cell survival pathway.
For instance, its expression levels can be modulated by
different types of cell stress. In two separate studies,
Raspaglio et al [34, 35] demonstrated increased βIIItubulin expression in ovarian cancer cells exposed to
hypoxia or nutrient deprivation. Under these conditions
βIII-tubulin was shown to bind to important signaling
proteins such as pro-survival kinase PIM1 [36]. This
protein kinase is involved in promoting chemoresistance,
and its expression levels have been correlated with
aggressive disease in pancreatic cancer [37, 38].
Therefore, it is possible that the increased levels of βIIItubulin allow for PIM1 to exert its pro-survival effect in
pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, a glycosylated and
phosphorylated form of βIII-tubulin has been identified in
the mitochondria of cancer cells [39]. It may be possible
that βIII-tubulin is involved in modulating apoptosis via
the mitochondria. Studies aimed at understanding how
βIII-tubulin hypersensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to
apoptosis are under investigation in our laboratory.
To determine whether suppression of βIII-tubulin
would affect the tumorigenic and metastatic potential
of pancreatic cancer cells, we silenced βIII-tubulin
expression in pancreatic cancer cells and measured
anchorage-dependent and independent-cell growth.
Knockdown of βIII-tubulin resulted in a significant
reduction in anchorage-dependent and independent
growth. The decrease in anchorage-independent cell
growth was associated with increased anoikis (anchorageindependent apoptosis), reinforcing the link between βIIItubulin silencing and induction of apoptosis in pancreatic
cancer cells. Indeed, tumor cells with high metastatic
potential have developed mechanisms of resistance to
this form of apoptosis [40]. To establish whether the
decreased tumorigenic potential in pancreatic cancer cells
with suppressed βIII-tubulin would translate in vivo, we
generated pancreatic cancer cells which stably expressed
βIII-tubulin shRNA. We showed for the first time that
when these cells were implanted into the pancreas of
mice there was decreased primary tumor growth and
metastases. Together, these data demonstrate that βIIItubulin is important in providing pancreatic cancer cells
with a key survival advantage, thus allowing them to grow
and metastasize.
Collectively, this work has identified a novel role
for βIII-tubulin in promoting pancreatic cancer growth
and survival. Identification of βIII-tubulin as a therapeutic
target has the potential to refine personalized medicine
for patients with this malignancy. The relatively limited
impact of chemotherapy in this malignancy does require

identification of agents with alternative anti-tumor
activity. Drugs targeting this system would be predicted
to have limited effects on normal tissues. Therefore
they lend themselves to prolonged use, such as in the
adjuvant setting. In particular the anti-metastatic effect
shown in vivo encourages exploration of their use in the
adjuvant setting and in conjunction with or sequential to
chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blot analysis was performed using the
following antibodies: anti-βIII-tubulin (Chemicon), antiβII-tubulin (Covance), anti-βI-tubulin (Covance) and
anti-GAPDH (Abcam) as described [22, 24, 28]. The
blots were scanned using LAS4000 scanner and quantified
using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare).

Western blot analysis

Cell culture
Human pancreatic cancer cells (MiaPaCa-2, Panc1 and HPAF-II) were obtained from ATCC and cultured
as described [41]. Normal Human Pancreatic Ductal
Epithelial (HPDE) cells (a kind gift from Ming Tsao,
Ontario Cancer Institute) were grown in Keratinocyteserum-free (KSF) medium supplemented with 50 mg/
ml bovine pituitary extract (BPE) and 5 ng/ml epidermal
growth factor (EGF) as described [42].

Immunofluorescence staining
24h post-transfection with siRNA, cells were seeded
onto glass chamber slides and allowed to adhere for
48h. The slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
immunofluorescence staining was performed as described
[22, 43, 44]. Primary and secondary antibodies used were,
anti-βIII-tubulin (1:500), anti-α-tubulin (1:500), anti-goat
AlexaFluor-488 or AlexaFluor-555 (1:1000). Images were
captured using a Leica confocal microscope.

Immunohistochemistry
Human PDA tissue specimens were collected by
surgical removal. The use of these sections was approved
by UNSW Human Research Ethics Committee (HCEC#
HC14039). Immunohistochemistry was performed on
paraffin-embedded human or mouse tumor tissue sections
as described [24, 41, 43]. Antibodies used were, antiβIII-tubulin (1:200) (Chemicon), anti-βII-tubulin (1:200)
(Covance), anti-luciferase (1:50) (Biovision incorporated).

Cell proliferation assays
HPDE cell proliferation was measured 72h posttransfection using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) kit
(Dojindo) as described [24, 41]. MiaPaCa-2 proliferation
was measured on an xCELLigence platform (ACEA
Biosciences). Cells were seeded 72h post-transfection at
3000 cells/well into 96-well E-Plates (ACEA Biosciences),
then transferred into an xCELLigence in a humidified
37oC chamber in 5% CO2. Cell Index (Proliferation) was
measured hourly for 48h.

siRNA transfection
Pancreatic cancer cells and HPDE cells were
transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). All cells were transfected with smart pool
On-Target Plus siRNAs designed against βII-Tubulin
(Thermoscientific, Cat. L-008260-00), βIII-Tubulin
(Thermoscientific, Cat. L-020099-00), or non-silencing
control (Thermoscientific, Cat. D-001810-10-20).

Cytotoxic drug-clonogenic assays
Following siRNA transfection cytotoxic drugclonogenic assays were performed as described [22, 24,
28].

Real time quantitative PCR (qPCR)

Cell cycle analysis

Total RNA was extracted from pancreatic cancer
cells and HPDEs, and transcribed to cDNA as described
[24, 43]. qPCR was performed using the QuantiFast
SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) as described [24, 43].
Primer sequences were: βIII-Tubulin forward primer,
5′-GCGAGATGTACGAAGACGAC-3′; βIII-Tubulin
reverse primer, 5′-TTTAGACACTGCTGGCTTCG-3′;
βII-Tubulin
forward
primer,

72h post siRNA transfection, MiaPaCa-2 cells were
incubated in Taxol (0-40 nM) or Vincristine (0-10 nM) for
8h, and cell cycle measured as described [44].

verified by measuring βIII-tubulin expression. GFPhi cells
were sorted on a BD Influx Cell Sorter and propagated for
2 weeks in 1 µg/ml puromycin.

48h after siRNA transfection, pancreatic cancer cells
were treated with culture medium containing cytotoxic
drugs for 24h. Cell death was measured using the Annexin
V-PE-7-AAD-FITC reagent (Millipore) as described
[41, 45, 46]. Caspase 3/7 activity was analyzed using
a Caspase-Glo luminescent based assay as previously
described [24, 41]. Briefly, pancreatic cancer cells were
treated with siRNA as above and seeded into a 96-well
white opaque plate and a corresponding clear 96-well
plate. 24h post-cytotoxic drug treatment, cells in the white
opaque plate were incubated with caspase 3/7 reagent for
2h at room temperature and luminescence measured with
a luminometer (PerkinElmer Victor 3). Cells in the clear
96-well plate were incubated with CCK-8 reagent for 1h
at room temperature and cell viability was determined by
measuring absorbance at 450nm. Caspase 3/7 activity was
then normalized to these values.

Orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse model
6-8 week old BALB/c nude mice were used. All
animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics
committee, UNSW (ACEC 12/7B). MiaPaCa-2 cells
(1X106) were implanted into the tail of the pancreas of
mice as described [41, 46]. After 8 weeks, mice were
sacrificed and pancreatic tumors, spleen, liver, kidneys,
Intestines, heart and lungs and any enlarged lymph nodes/
other organs with signs of metastases were collected.
Primary tumor size was measured using microcallipers
as described [24, 43]. Metastases were confirmed by
macroscopic observation, post-harvest individual organ
ex-vivo bioluminescence on the Xenogen IVIS Lumina,
as described [47].

Soft-agar assay

Statistical Analyses

MiaPaCa-2 and HPAF-II cells were seeded in
0.33% agar in X2 growth medium on a 5% agar layer
in 6 well plates, 48h post-siRNA transfection. Colonies
were allowed to grow over 3 weeks, after which plates
were stained with MTT and visualized on an ImageQuant
LAS4000 luminometer (GE Healthcare). Colonies were
counted as described [24].

Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of
the mean (SEM) and analyzed where appropriate using
ANOVA followed by parametric Dunnett, or Student’s t
test followed by the nonparametric Wilcoxin test using
the GraphPad Prism program. P<0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
