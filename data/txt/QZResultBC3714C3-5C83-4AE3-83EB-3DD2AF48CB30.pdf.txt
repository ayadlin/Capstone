ABSTRACT
Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a promising technique for infusing a
therapeutic agent through a catheter with a pressure gradient to create bulk flow for
improving drug spread into the brain. So far, gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) is the
most commonly applied surrogate agent for predicting drug distribution through magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). However, Gd-DTPA provides only a short observation duration,
and concurrent infusion provides an indirect measure of the exact drug distribution. In
this study, we propose using microbubbles as a contrast agent for MRI monitoring, and
evaluate their use as a drug-carrying vehicle to directly monitor the infused drug. Results
show that microbubbles can provide excellent detectability through MRI relaxometry and
accurately represent drug distribution during CED infusion. Compared with the short halflife of Gd-DTPA (1-2 hours), microbubbles allow an extended observation period of up to
12 hours. Moreover, microbubbles provide a sufficiently high drug payload, and glioma
mice that underwent a CED infusion of microbubbles carrying doxorubicin presented
considerable tumor growth suppression and a significantly improved survival rate. This
study recommends microbubbles as a new theranostic tool for CED procedures.

to enhance neurotrophic factor expression for the treatment of
neurodegenerative diseases [10].
The majority of CED studies have indirectly monitored
the volumes of distribution by concurrently infusing surrogate
tracers in animals: iopanoic acid to enhance computed
tomography imaging [3, 9], gadopentetate dimeglumine
(Gd-DTPA) to enhance T1-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) [6, 11–16], or magnetic nanoparticles
to enhance T2-weighted MRI [17, 18]. In addition,
some studies have used radiolabeled drugs with nuclear
imaging monitoring [9]. So far, the concurrent infusion
of Gd-DTPA (MW = 938 Da) with the delivered agents
or surrogates in CED procedures is the most common
method for indirectly monitoring drug or surrogate

INTRODUCTION
Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a promising
technique in interstitial delivery of a drug into brain. It
functions by establishing a pressure gradient at the tip of the
infusion catheter to create bulk flow to actively “push” the
drug into the extracellular space [1, 2]. Compared with the
traditional interstitial approach, which relies on drug diffusion,
CED is capable of delivering therapeutic macromolecules at
a relatively uniform concentration over a larger distribution
of the brain [3]. Preclinical studies have been conducted in
primates to test the safety of the CED technique [4–7], and
the technique has also been clinically tested to enhance the
chemotherapeutic agent for treating glioma patients [8, 9] and

RESULTS

distribution; it is highly accessible because Gd-DTPA
infusion intravenously is now a standard procedure
in MRI examinations. However, Gd-DTPA enhances
signal for only a short time (the signal typically peaks in
intensity at 20–30 minutes and then declines within 1–2
hours through renal clearance [19, 20]). This short signal
enhancement period may not be sufficient for the clinical
CED procedure since the continuous infusion could persist
for 8–24 hours [1, 2].
Microbubbles are lipid-based shells that encapsulate a stabilized gas (such as hexafluoride, SF6, or
perfluoropropane, C3F8). They have a typical size of 2–6
μm, and can circulate in the blood and pass through CNS
capillaries. Since microbubbles contain a gas–liquid interface
that is highly responsive to ultrasound mechanical stress,
microbubbles provide strong ultrasound energy scattering
that enables microbubbles to be applied in diagnostic
ultrasound as a contrast agent [21–23]. In addition, ultrasound
energy interactions with microbubbles have been confirmed
to transiently permeate CNS capillaries [24–26].
Microbubbles can potentially be used as a magnetic
resonance (MR) contrast agent in vivo because of the
induction of enhanced local magnetic susceptibility
caused by the gas encapsulated in microbubbles.
Accordingly, because of the enhanced field susceptibility
effect, previous reports have already shown the feasibility
of using microbubbles as a contrast medium for CNS
imaging in T2- or T2*-weighted MRI [27, 28]. Besides
the intrinsic MR sensitivity, modifying the lipid surface
of microbubbles enables conjugation via electrostatic
and hydrophobic interactions, and such microbubbles
have been presented as a drug carrier [29, 30]. We have
also developed a technique using these microbubbles to
encapsulate and carry chemotherapeutic agents such as
BCNU [31, 32] and doxorubicin (Dox) [33, 34]. Since
microbubbles may provide MR image contrast and
can be designed as a chemotherapeutic drug carrier, we
hypothesize that they can potentially be infused with
drug-carrying microbubbles during CED and then used
to directly monitor the distribution of administered drugs
through MRI. A previous study combined the infusion of
microbubbles with ultrasound triggering through CED
to increase CNS permeation, but did not delineate its
feasibility in MRI detectability [35].
In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using
microbubbles for monitoring the distribution of an infused
drug through MRI, and we propose using drug-carrying
microbubbles as a theranostic platform for CED. We
employed MR R2 relaxometry to calibrate level changes
reflecting the infused microbubble concentration. Dox, a
commonly used chemotherapeutic agent, was employed as
a test drug. The Dox loading efficiency of microbubbles was
evaluated to consider the possibility of using microbubbles
as a theranostic platform in CED therapy, and the therapeutic
efficiency of CED using an infusion of Dox microbubbles
(Dox-MB) was tested on glioma-bearing mice.

Figure 1A and 1B shows the fabricated Dox-MB
under observation through fluorescence microscopy. The
colocalization of the microbubbles in the bright field
and fluorescence images indicates strong conjugation of
Dox with the bubble surface. The conjugation efficiency
of Dox, which was measured by calculating the ratio of
bound Dox to the initial Dox amount, was estimated to
be 77.6% ± 4.4%. Figure 1C shows the size distribution
of Dox-MB compared with commercially available
microbubbles (SonoVue). The mean size of the DoxMB was 2.8 ± 0.9 μm and the mean concentration was
(3.4 ± 0.3) × 1010 microbubbles/mL. The in vitro tested
cytotoxicity of the Dox-MB is shown in Figure 1D. DoxMB presented lower cell toxicity at 2 hours of culturing,
with cell viability being 79.22% ± 1.41%, and took 6
hours to reach toxicity similar to that of a 2 hour treatment
with free Dox (cell viability = 38.43% ± 8.56% versus
44.27% ± 18.36%). This delayed cytotoxicity of Dox-MB
implies that they may release drugs more slowly. This has
a potential benefit: more of the drug may be released into
tumor cells over the course of in vivo delivery.
Using in-vivo small-animal ultrasound imaging, we
verified microbubble distribution during CED infusion
and compared this with the traditional IV administered
route. Traditional IV administrations of microbubbles
(Figure 2; first column) showed uniformed microbubble
distribution for the overall skull-removed brain region
(as identified by hyperechoic signals). However, the
microbubbles diminished quickly because of liver RES
blockage, and the microbubble concentration flowing
through the brain tissue rapidly decayed after 5 minutes.
By contrast, while the microbubbles were infused through
CED (Figure 2, second column), the signals apparently
did not decay during infusion but rather presented a
hyperechoic increase, which we observed to be highly
localized (indicated by arrows). This implies that during
CED infusion, microbubbles have a much longer halflife in brain tissue and thus can reveal the location of the
infusate at different times.
To test the microbubbles’ lipid shells for potential
toxicity to CNS tissue, drug-unloaded microbubbles
were infused to identify pathological changes. Figure 3
compares the HE stains of normal mouse brain after CED
procedure with SovoVue (Figure 3A) for identifying
potential histological changes caused by CED microbubble
infusions, using SonoVue infusion as a comparison (Figure
3B). It was confirmed that, besides the tract trauma caused
by inserting the catheter, no additional tissue damage was
caused by the Dox-MB infusion.
Figure 4 shows typical MR images of the Dox-MB
we assembled, when delivered through CED infusion.
The catheter tract can be identified in the T2 weighted
images (Figure 4, top row) from the catheter-induced
CNS tissue wound (hypointense core) surrounded by

edema (hyperintense rim). The T2* images (Figure 4,
middle row) show a further increased signal change from
the improved sensitivity in magnetic susceptibility caused
by the tract wound. However, both the T2 and T2* images
showed signal change only along the catheter tract; they
were unable to demonstrate the distribution of the infused
molecules. By contrast, the R2 map (Figure 4, bottom
row) clearly indicates the distribution of CED-infused
microbubbles (surround the putamen) and shows that the
distribution is much wider than that in the catheter-infused
region. Furthermore, the R2 signal plateaued 1 hour after
microbubble catheter infusion. The signal can last up to
2 hours after infusion (although with marked R2 signal
decay), but we failed to identify an R2 level change 12
hours after CED infusion (apart from accumulation along
the catheter tract).
Subsequently, we compared the Dox-MB distribution after CED in normal and tumor-implant animals
under the observation of MR T2 images (Figure 5A
and 5D), R2 maps (Figure 5B and 5E; observed 1 hour
after the microbubble infusion) and with the distribution
compared with the Dox-emitted fluorescence microscopy
(Figure 5C, 5F). The fluorescence distribution emitted
from Dox both highly correlated with MRI R2 maps in
normal (Figure 5B) and tumor-implant brain (Figure 5E),
while excluding the R2 signal-saturating area in ventricle
due to distinct R2 relaxometry characteristics of CSF to
brain tissue (denoted by “*” in figures). The correlation

between the R2 map change and the measured Dox
concentration was also seen by measuring the peak R2
level in each infused animal, with the quantitated Dox
deposited near the infused tip end of the brain tissue, as
well as the contralateral site as a reference (see Figure 4G;
n = 5).
In five animal measurements, the Dox concentration
ranged from 0.5 to 1.3 μg/mL at the infusion site. This
corresponds to an R2 value change of 21–35 s-1 at the
infusion hemisphere. The estimated correlation between
an R2 change and measured Dox concentration was high
(r  =  0.86), implying that the drug concentration when
using microbubbles as a carrier could be directly estimated
from R2 maps. These observation supports that MRI R2
map can reveal not only the distribution of Dox-MB,
but also can quantitatively estimate the concentration of
infused Dox in the brain.
Figure 6A shows longitudinal R2 level changes
of the CED-infused 5 μL Dox microbubbles (with
infusions at concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/
mL). To compare the R2 detectability of the Dox and
SonoVue microbubbles, we also infused SonoVue
through CED and monitored the results. Infusing Dox
microbubbles at various doses showed a clear R2 level
change, where greater R2 intensity changes corresponded
with higher concentrations of Dox microbubbles. The
R2 map presents a longitudinal change, which implies
that longitudinal monitoring of the Dox distribution

through MR relaxometry is feasible. We noted that the
peak R2 level change under various concentrations
of Dox microbubble infusions consistently occurred
approximately 1 hour after the CED infusion, with the R2
signal change lasting up to 12 hours. At 8–12 hours after
infusion, an R2 level increase was observed only near the
tip, close to the cortex; this implies that the remaining
microbubbles (or their debris) were refluxed along the
infusion tract and accumulated at the tract entry because
of the buoyancy effect. The distribution of R2 change
could be also identified for SonoVue (at a concentration
of 5 mg/mL), but the SonoVue infusion had a relatively
short observable R2 duration (the R2 signal vanished after
4 hours), and the R2 signal increased only near the tip
end of the infused tract. Furthermore, the distribution of
SonoVue in the brain was considerably limited, compared
with the distribution of Dox microbubbles.
The comparison of the R2 observation lifetime is
clearer in Figure 6B, which depicts an analysis of the R2
level change at the selected ROI (see Figure 6A; a 2-mm
circular ROI was selected with the cannula tip end as the

center). The estimated half-life, defined by the time to
conduct a 50% R2 signal decay, was 4 hours for SonoVue
and 12 hours for the Dox microbubble infusion, showing
a significantly prolonged half-life for MRI monitoring of
the CED-infused bubbles.
For comparison, 5 µL of a clinical contrast agent
Gd-DTPA with a concentration of 0.03 M was infused
through CED and a serial MR T1 image was recorded
(Figure 6C). The intensity of the ROI surrounding the
center of infusion was compared at different times. The
half-life for this agent was approximately 2 hours.
The therapeutic efficacy of the Dox microbubbles
infused through CED was then evaluated. With the
5uL of 0.1 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL Dox-MB infusions,
19  mice bearing U87 glioma cell implantations were
tested (see Figure 7). Figure 7A shows the tumor
progression through in vivo imaging system (IVIS)
observation among various study groups. Animals
treated with a sham 5uL microbubbles infusion and
with intravenous administration of 50 μL of 0.5 mg/
mL Dox-MB both showed a 500-fold increase in tumor

progression according to the intensity of luminescence
from Day 10 to 17. However, for the treatment groups,
this took 26 days for the low dose group and 31 days
for the high dose group. The corresponding Kaplan–
Meier survival analysis is shown in Figure 7B. The
mean survival time for untreated animals and Dox-MB
IV-administration group was observed to be 26 and
27.5 days respectively. Infusing Dox microbubbles at a
concentration of 0.1 mg/mL extended mean survival to
33 days, whereas increasing the concentration to 0.5 mg/
mL extended mean survival to 41 days. The procedure
of infused Dox microbubbles through CED not only
extended our capabilities for longitudinally monitoring
therapeutic agents in the brain through MRI but also
provided effective brain tumor treatment.
Figure 8 provides evidence to reveal that MBs
(tagged with fluorescent dye; in green; Figure 8B) indeed
carried the Dox (in red; Figure 8C) and penetrated into
deep intracellular space away from the catheter and
was endocytosed by glioma cells (Figure 8D-8G). This

supports that MBs can be well delivered through the whole
tumor area, and can also support the proposed scheme that
combining CED infusion with drug-carrying MBs can
deliver drugs into tumors.

DISCUSSION
Significance of this study
This study presents, for the first time, the use of
microbubbles as an imaging-contrast monitoring agent
as well as a drug-carrying vehicle in CED. We show that
microbubbles provide excellent detectability through MRI
relaxometry and can represent drug distribution during
CED infusion. Compared with the traditional gadolinium
contrast medium with a half-life of 1–2 hours (Figure 6D)
[19, 20], microbubbles provide an extended observation
period of up to 12 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, where
previously the gadolinium contrast medium could be used
only as a surrogate agent for indirect monitoring of drug

distribution during CED, drug-carrying microbubbles
can facilitate direct monitoring, not only of the drug
distribution but also of semi-quantitative measurements
of the drug in the brain. For lesions such as brain tumors
that have contrast-enhancement characteristics, the
distribution of the gadolinium contrast medium in the
infusate may be disturbed by the lesions and not represent
drug distribution. Thus, this study developed microbubbles
as a theranostic tool in CED procedures.

We employed a novel bubble fabrication procedure,
using not liposomes but Dox mixed directly with a lipid
through our previously developed synthesis approach
[32, 33]. Dox was linked to the lipid structure (this can
be confirmed from Figure 1A, where the emitted red
fluorescence is colocalized with the lipid from Figure 1B). An
advantage of the formula is that Dox can be preserved in the
microbubbles during diffusion, preventing CNS cell damage
that the free drug would normally cause. Dox -MB may also
enter further into tumor cells because the endocytosis of
tumor cells is more effective than that of normal CNS cells.

Drug-carrying capability
Microbubbles have long been employed as a theranostic agent in ultrasound-imaging-guided drug delivery. The
common approach is to encapsulate therapeutic molecules
inside a 100 nm liposome structure and perform the
conjugation with 2–5 μm microbubbles [36–40]. However,
the decoupling of liposome–micro-bubble bonds is easily
catalyzed and occurs quickly; consequently, the direct MRI
monitoring of the microbubbles may not fully represent the
location of the drug, particularly for a long infusion time in
the CED procedure (8–24 hours in clinical tests).

Characteristics of our microbubbles
In this study, we compared SonoVue microbubbles
with the microbubbles we synthesized considering their
differences in MRI R2 relaxometry and observation
duration. Our microbubbles allow a longer observation
period (up to 12 hours) than the SonoVue microbubbles
do (4 hours). This may result from the microbubbles’ size:
the mean size of our bubbles was approximately 2 μm
compared with SonoVue’s 5 μm. Larger microbubbles

present greater concerns for bubble stability, because
larger lipid shells tend to collapse through catalysis and
unbalanced surface tension, leading to rapid macroscopic
folding events, bubble disruption, or bubble resolution
[41]. By contrast, our microbubbles have greater structural
stability from their smaller size, and a bubble accumulation
plateau can be observed after infusion. This might explain
the difference between the dynamics of SonoVue (with its
monotonic signal decreasing longitudinally; see Figure 6B,
black bar) and those of our microbubbles (which increased
to a concentration plateau and then descended; see Figure
6B, gray bars).

refilled with perfluoropropane (C3F8). After intensive
shaking in an agitator for 45 seconds, Dox-MB were
formed. They were placed on ice for 30 minutes to
stabilize the microbubble structures before use. For some
batches of the microbubble synthesis, fluorescein amidite
(FAM) tagged lipid materials (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA)
were employed for the observation under fluorescent
microscopy.
We estimated the payload of Dox on the synthesized
bubbles. The supernatant from a Dox-MB suspension was
collected as an unloaded Dox-MB complex (free Dox).
The Dox-MB were re-suspended with PBS, subjected
to sonication for 5 minutes to completely destroy the
microbubbles, and centrifuged at 11,000 g for 2 minutes.
The final precipitate was re-suspended with DDW as a
loaded Dox-MB complex. Subsequently, both the free Dox
and loaded Dox complex were subjected to a nitrification
reaction followed by ICP-AES estimation. The loading
efficiency of Dox on the microbubbles was calculated as

Therapeutic level of Dox
Previous Dox anticancer studies have provided a
comprehensive understanding of the Dox concentration
required to be therapeutic. Clinically, it has been reported
that intratumoral Dox concentrations reaching 819 ± 482
ng/mL tissue correlate with partial or complete responses
in breast cancer patients [42]. Our study shows that the
proposed Dox-MB provide an excellent drug-loading
efficiency of 0.78 ± 32 mg/mL. We observed that the
glioma-implanted mice responded well to the infused
Dox-MB, and the measured local concentration of Dox
infused through CED reached 0.6–1.3 μg/mL locally. This
implies that the microbubbles can carry a sufficiently high
concentration of Dox into the brain through CED, and the
delivered amount of Dox can reach therapeutic levels.
This is supported by the therapeutic efficacy presented in
Figure 7: the 0.5 mg/mL Dox-MB infusion retarded tumor
progression and prolonged animal survival.
In conclusion, CED is an efficient system for
delivering chemotherapeutics to brain tumors. Lipidbased microbubbles provide imaging information for
both the distribution and quantity of the infusate, and may
circumvent confusion with enhanced lesions. Moreover,
loading the microbubbles with drugs has demonstrable
theranostic value for brain tumor treatment.

For reference and comparison with our
microbubbles, we employed the commercially available
SonoVue SF6-filled ultrasound microbubbles (2–5 µm, 10
µL/mouse; Bracco, Milan, Italy).

In vitro cytotoxicity test
A cell culture with a concentration of 104 U87MGLu cells was placed in each well of a 96-well plate
and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 hours.
Subsequently, the U87MG-Lu cells were cocultured
with normal saline, free Dox, or Dox microbubbles
(concentration calibrated to 100 μM) for 2 hours or 6
hours to compare their acute cytotoxicity responses. After
coculturing, the medium (containing sample) of the cells
was moved and refilled with fresh culture medium. The
cell viability and proliferation were measured with the
alamarBlue reagent (AbDSerotec, Oxford, UK).

In the glioma mice, U87MG-Lu glioma cells were
cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in MEM with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen).
To implant the U87MG-Lu cells, the animals were
anesthetized with 2% isoflurane gas and immobilized on a
stereotactic frame. A sagittal incision was made in the skin
overlying the calvarium, and a 27G needle was used to
create a hole in the exposed cranium 1.5 mm anterior and
2 mm lateral to the bregma. Five microliters of U87MGLu cell suspension (1×105 cell/µL) was injected at a depth
of 3 mm from the brain surface over a 5-minute period,
and the needle was withdrawn over 2 minutes. Brain
growth was monitored through MRI for 10 days after
implantation.

tumor site in coronary slices to calculate the average
tumor R2 value. Subsequently, color-coded R2 maps
were generated. For comparison with the traditional
contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging detection, GdDTPA (Magnevist, Berlex Laboratories, Wayne, NJ)
was administered through CED. T1W1 images were
acquired using a gradient echo FLASH sequence with the
following imaging parameters: TR/TE = 230 ms; FOV =
30 × 17.82 mm2; in-plane resolution = 256 × 256 pixels;
slice thickness = 0.8 mm; flip angle = 70°.

Small animal ultrasound imaging
A small animal ultrasound imaging system (Vevo
2100, VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada) was employed
to confirm the microbubble distribution from the CED
infusion. The hair on the skin over the tumor was clipped,
2 × 2 mm2 of the cranial bone of the observed hemisphere
was removed, and acoustic gel was applied to provide
ultrasound energy coupling. The array transducer had
a central frequency of 18 MHz, with axial and lateral
resolutions of 75 μm and 165 μm, respectively. The focal
length was 8 mm with MI = 0.2. Real-time imaging was
performed at a frame rate of 10 Hz (corresponding to a
temporal resolution of 100 ms).

CED procedure
The CED procedure was similar to that described
in [43]. In brief, infusion cannulae were fabricated with
silica tubing (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) fused
to a 0.1 mL syringe (Plastic One, Roanoke, VA) with a
0.5 mm stepped-tip needle that protruded from the silica
guide base. The syringes were loaded with a liposomal
drug (0.04 mg/µL) and attached to a microinfusion pump
(Bioanalytical Systems, Lafayette, IN). The syringe with a
silica cannula was mounted onto a stereotactic holder and
then lowered through a puncture hole made in the skull
(for tumor-implanted animals, the infusion occurred at the
same region in the caudate putamen where tumor cells had
previously been injected). The microbubble solution was
infused at a rate of 1 µL/min until a volume of 5 µL had
been delivered, and the cannulae were removed 2 minutes
afterwards, for a total infusion time of 7 minutes.

Quantification of Dox release into CNS tissues
After undergoing CED with an infusion of Dox
microbubbles, the animals were sacrificed and brain
tissues around the infusion center were collected and
weighed. The Dox was extracted with the addition of
2 mL of HCl (2 M, at 4°C), and the extracted solution
was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 minutes in a SIGMA
3-30K (Heraeus Co., Germany). The supernatant of the
sample was then collected, filtered through a 0.22 μm
filter, diluted with a mobile phase solution, and analyzed
using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
with a UV detector (S1125, Sykam GmbH, Germany).
The mobile phase solution consisted of 50 vol% DDW
diluted with HPLC-grade methanol in DDW. A column
packed with RP-18 (Alltima C-18 3u, Alltech, IL, USA)
was used with a detection wavelength of 256 nm and a
flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The amount of Dox was analyzed
to determine the area under its peak at a retention time of
3.6 ± 0.2 minutes. The Dox concentration was expressed
per gram of tissue.

MRI procedure
MRI images were acquired on a 7-T magnetic
resonance scanner (Bruker ClinScan, Germany) with a
four-channel surface coil used on the top of the mouse
brain. After the CED procedure, the anesthetized animals
were placed in an acrylic holder and positioned at the
magnet center. T2*-weighted imaging sequences were
acquired to highlight the magnetic susceptibility effect
caused by the infused microbubbles (pulse repetition time
(TR)/ echo time (TE) = 30 ms/18 ms; flip angle = 40°;
slice thickness = 0.6 mm; matrix size = 256 × 384; FOV
= 80 × 130 mm2).
R2 relaxometry was performed by obtaining
a multiple-TE spin-echo sequence three times with
the following parameters: TR = 3860 ms, TE =
8/14/28/57/85/228 ms, matrix size = 128 × 256, FOV
= 38 × 76 mm2, and slice thickness = 1.4 mm). The
obtained multiple-TE images were processed using
MATLAB to calculate the R2 value (1/T2) by fitting an
exponential curve of the signal intensities as a function
of echo time for each pixel [44]. ROIs were set at the

Tumor progression monitoring
In an efficacy study, a Spectrum IVIS (Caliper,
Hopkington, MA) was used to observe tumor growth.
D-luciferin (3 mg/mouse) was intraperitoneally injected
into mice before imaging, and a luminescent signal from
the tumor was obtained by the IVIS 8 minutes later.
Images were taken twice a week for 7 weeks.

Histopathology was performed on 10 µm sections of
paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded brains. Slides
were placed in hydrochloric acid–potassium ferrocyanide
solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. The slides
were counterstained with nuclear fast red for 5 minutes.
Brain tissue damage and tumor progression were evaluated
using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The distribution of
Dox was assessed through red fluorescence microscopy
imaging.
