Central nervous system (CNS) recurrence continues to be a significant complication in the treatment of adult patients
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Preventing CNS recurrence has been a therapeutic challenge and has not
been addressed critically in many clinical trials. Adult studies modeled on childhood ALL studies have used multiple
treatment modalities, including radiation therapy, systemic therapy, intrathecal therapy, and combinations thereof.
Cranial irradiation is effective but is offset by substantial toxicity, including neurologic sequelae. Systemic chemotherapy, especially with cytarabine (AraC) and methotrexate, has demonstrated promise in decreasing CNS recurrence,
but therapeutic levels of drugs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are not maintained. Intrathecal chemotherapy with or
without high-dose systemic therapy is the most common approach to CNS prophylaxis. Liposomal AraC recently has
become available and confers prolonged levels of free AraC in the CSF, a critical requirement for CNS prophylactic
therapy. This review discusses the various modalities used for CNS prophylaxis in patients with ALL and the emerging
trends, with specific emphasis on the outcome in terms of event-free survival and toxicity. Cancer 2010;116:2290–

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) refers to a group of lymphoid disorders resulting from monoclonal proliferation
and expansion of lymphoid blasts in the bone marrow, blood, and other organs. ALL occurs at a rate of approximately 1 to
1.5 per 100,000 individuals and exhibits a bimodal distribution with an early peak in children ages 4 to 5 years (4 to 5 per
100,000 individuals) followed by a second peak at approximately age 50 years (2 per 100,000 individuals).1 ALL is relatively uncommon in late childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood.2 The etiology of the disease is not yet well known.
Chromosomal translocations that occur in utero during fetal hematopoiesis have been suggested as the primary cause for
pediatric ALL, and postnatal genetic events have been suggested as secondary contributors.3 Associations between human
T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, as well as human immunodeficiency virus and
lymphoproliferative disorders, also have been established.4,5
Age remains an important determinant of prognosis and outcome.6,7 Before the use of central nervous system
(CNS) prophylaxis, the CNS was the most frequently reported site of initial recurrence in children with ALL, accounting
for up to 75% of cases.8,9 However, with therapies that incorporate CNS prophylaxis, 5-year event-free survival rates of
approximately 80% have been achieved in pediatric ALL.10 Still, CNS recurrence remains a major limitation to achieving
complete cure, accounting for 30% to 40% of recurrences in some pediatric clinical trials.11,12 Although the cure rate in
children with ALL has reached approximately 80%, cure rates in adults with ALL remain at only 30% to 40%.7,13 Several
reasons exist for the discrepancy between adult and child outcomes. Childhood ALL protocols typically involve more
dose-intense regimens, whereas adults typically receive less intensive protocols because of their poorer tolerance of chemotherapeutics like asparaginase and methotrexate (MTX).14 It has been demonstrated that increasing the intensity of chemotherapy, as opposed to increasing its duration, improves ALL survival rates.15 Thus, the adaptation of protocols from
childhood ALL has improved survival rates greatly for adults with ALL. However, because systemic control remains

problematic in adults, CNS recurrence in this patient
population has not been addressed as thoroughly.13 Consequently, the benefit of CNS prophylaxis in adults is less
well established. In this review, we examine the value of
CNS prophylactic therapy in this difficult-to-treat
population. The prevalence and outcome of CNS recurrence in adult patients with ALL are considered, and the
available CNS prophylactic therapies and important considerations when deciding on CNS prophylaxis therapies
are discussed.
Adult ALL and CNS Involvement
CNS involvement at the time of presentation is uncommon in adults with ALL; it has been reported in as few as
5% to 7% of patients.16,17 This may be an underestimate,
however, because much of the data are derived from
patient characteristics at clinical trial enrollment in
which patients with suspected CNS involvement were
excluded.16 The use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology
or CSF flow cytometry to evaluate patients affects the frequency with which occult CNS involvement is detected
(with flow cytometry the more sensitive tool).18 Without
prophylaxis, CNS recurrence occurs in approximately
30% of adult patients in complete response.19

CNS recurrence can occur in 3 settings: isolated
CNS recurrence, concomitant bone marrow and CNS recurrence, or postbone marrow recurrence, and the clinical
manifestations can be devastating.20 CNS involvement
may manifest as lymphomatous or leukemic meningitis,
both forms of neoplastic meningitis (NM) that occur in
approximately 5% to 15% of patients with leukemia or
lymphoma and in 5% of all cancer patients overall.21-23
NM has multiple signs and symptoms, can progress rapidly, and can result in profound morbidity and mortality
(Table 1).24 The survival of patients with untreated NM
is estimated to be only 4 to 6 weeks.21 Patients with ALL
also can present with parenchymal metastases. Clinical
manifestations may vary and depend on the size and number of metastases. Lazarus and colleagues reported a significantly lower rate of survival in adults with ALL and CNS
involvement at diagnosis who were treated on the United
Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) ALL/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) protocol
compared with patients who had no (or unknown) CNS
involvement (Fig. 1).16 Indeed, of the patients who developed disease recurrence on that regimen, 4% developed
disease recurrence in the CNS, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 0% for those patients.25

Review Article

Surapaneni and colleagues demonstrated that,
among patients who had an isolated CNS recurrence (n ¼
17 of 439 patients), 88% (n ¼ 15) subsequently developed disease recurrence in the bone marrow, which contributed to the continued poor outcome in this patient
population.20 Moreover, Sancho and colleagues reported
that adults with ALL and CNS recurrence had a poor
prognosis similar to that for patients who developed only
bone marrow recurrence.26 These findings demonstrate
that, whether isolated or concomitant with bone marrow
recurrence, CNS recurrence is associated with poor outcomes. Therefore, effective CNS prophylaxis in adult
patients with ALL remains the best approach to address
CNS recurrence.20,27

recently that children with high hyperdiploid ALL have
a higher disposition for developing recurrences to the
CNS and testes.33
On the basis of the association between white blood
cells (WBCs) in the CSF and the frequency of CNS recurrence, CNS risk stratification for patients with ALL was
developed. Patients at risk were stratified as follows:
CNS1 status, no leukemic blasts in the CSF; CNS2 status,
<5 WBCs/lL in CSF with blasts; and CNS3 status, 5
WBCs/lL in CSF with blasts.10,34 Evaluating risk status
can help determine the most appropriate CNS prophylactic modality while avoiding the possible over treatment
of patients who are not at high risk of CNS
recurrence.10,34,35

Risk Factors for CNS Involvement in Patients
With ALL
Because the incidence of CNS recurrence in hematologic
malignancies is variable, certain risk factors help identify
the patients most at risk of CNS involvement. An
increased risk of CNS involvement has been observed in
patients who exhibit elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase
levels, a high leukemic cell proliferation index, and/or the
mature B-cell subtype of ALL (B-ALL).28,29 A retrospective analysis by Bassan and colleagues indicated that adult
patients with mature B-ALL had an 18% incidence of
CNS involvement at presentation compared with an overall incidence of 4.5%, suggesting that there is an increased
risk of CNS involvement in this subgroup.30 In contrast,
in an analysis from the United Kingdom MRC trial, the
investigators reported a higher incidence of CNS involvement at diagnosis associated with the T-cell immunophenotype.16 Associations with increased leukocyte counts
and the presence of a mediastinal mass also were reported
in that trial. Other clinical characteristics associated with
CNS leukemia include elevated hemoglobin, creatinine,
alkaline phosphatase, and fibrinogen levels; the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive karyotype; and a high
proliferative index.9,31
Other chromosomal abnormalities also are associated with worse outcomes in adult ALL. Moorman et al
demonstrated that, in addition to Ph-positive karyotype,
patients with chromosomal translocations t(4;11),
t(8;14), a ‘‘complex karyotype’’ that involves >5 chromosomal abnormalities, or low hypodiploidy/near triploidy
had significantly lower 5-year event-free and overall survival than patients with the Ph-negative karyotype; and
the latter 3 variables were independent of sex, age, white
blood cell count, and T-cell status.32 It was suggested

CNS Prophylaxis: Therapeutic Modalities
To reduce the incidence of CNS involvement, effective
CNS prophylaxis regimens have been developed based on
pediatric ALL protocols. Standard prophylaxis for CNS
malignancy can involve radiation therapy (RT), systemic
chemotherapy, intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy, or a combination thereof.

2292

Radiation Therapy

Cranial and/or craniospinal irradiation (CSI) are the
oldest CNS prophylaxis therapies considered for both pediatric and adult patients with ALL.36 In most patients,
RT is combined with either systemic or IT chemotherapy
to achieve prolonged event-free survival.37,38 Simone et al
observed a benefit when using cranial irradiation or CSI
with or without IT MTX in pediatric patients with
ALL.39 This was confirmed later in a study by Pui et al in
which a combination of cranial irradiation with IT MTX
also produced a benefit.40 Very few studies have systematically recorded the use of RT as CNS prophylaxis in
adult ALL. Sanders et al reported the effectiveness of CSI
in preventing CNS recurrence in adults with ALL who already had achieved remission of their primary cancer.41
However, although CSI with or without IT chemotherapy
eliminated CNS recurrence in the spine, it did not prevent
extraneural recurrences.
Radiation can be an effective form of CNS-directed
therapy in ALL but often is associated with late adverse
effects, such as secondary neoplasms, endocrinopathy,
neurocognitive dysfunction, and neurotoxicity.42 Quality-of-life studies in long-term young adult survivors of
ALL indicate lower marital rates than adult controls; these
correlate with the side effects of RT that affect growth, ie,
those related to neuroendocrine deficits43 and learning

defects.44 The side effects caused by cranial irradiation are
fewer and less pronounced in adult patients with ALL
than in children, although patients aged >60 years appear
to be more susceptible than younger adults to cognitive
impairment after RT.45,46
Efforts to omit cranial irradiation in patients with
ALL have been tested in both pediatric and adult ALL trials. Without RT, the observed CNS recurrence rate
(including combined CNS and hematologic recurrence)
was between 6% and 8.3% in 2 pediatric trials.47,48 However, the overall 5-year event-free survival rate was only
60.7% and 68.4%, respectively. The investigators suggested that inadequate systemic chemotherapy for the primary cancer was the main factor. In this context, Annino
et al observed that, in adults, the addition of high-dose
dexamethasone to systemic treatment reduced the CNS
recurrence rate to 2%.49 Kantarjian et al also reported that
the addition of intensive systemic and IT MTX and cytarabine (AraC) reduced the CNS recurrence rate in adults
to 4%.50 Furthermore, when effective systemic chemotherapy was administered, the radiation dose was reduced
without increasing the risk of CNS recurrence.51 In a
CNS prophylaxis study of adults with ALL who received
IT and systemic therapy but not cranial irradiation, the
frequency of CNS recurrence was similar to that observed
in protocols that included cranial irradiation.26
The Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) Study Group
also has demonstrated that high-risk patients (defined in
their study as those with >1000 leukemic blasts per lL in
peripheral blood on Day 8 of the ALL BFM 90 protocol,
or <1000 leukemic blasts per lL but 5% more bone marrow blasts on Day 33 of the protocol, or Ph-positive ALL)
could receive a lower dose of radiation (12 grays) without
increasing the risk of CNS recurrence.51 A retrospective
analysis of intermediate or high-risk adult patients with
ALL (aged >30 years, >30,000 WBCs/lL, adverse cytogenetics, and/or residual leukemia on a Day-28 bone marrow biopsy after induction) who were treated on normal
BFM protocols or on augmented BFM protocols (which
included prophylactic radiation; 1800 centigrays over first
2 weeks of consolidation) experienced a 7% CNS recurrence rate. It is noteworthy that, in that trial, patients who
received the augmented BFM protocol (n ¼ 13) experienced a 0% rate of CNS recurrence.52 Furthermore, the
augmented BFM protocol included higher doses of systemic vincristine, asparaginase, MTX, and dexamethasone. The United Kingdom MRC ALL/ECOG 2993
protocol, as described above, included high-dose systemic
MTX and RT and resulted in a 4% recurrence rate. Thus,

the prevention of CNS recurrence can depend on an effective systemic therapy regimen. In the past 2 decades, therapeutic approaches have concentrated on circumventing
cranial irradiation for multiple reasons, including ease of
administration and cost.9 Currently, it is widely believed
that, in the low-risk groups, CNS irradiation can be
replaced with systemic, high-dose MTX or IT-MTX.53
Pui concluded that a combination of early, intensive,
systemic and IT chemotherapy could lower the CNS
recurrence rate in patients with ALL, providing the
opportunity to omit prophylactic cranial irradiation.13

Systemic chemotherapy

Success in treating and preventing CNS recurrence
with chemotherapy depends primarily on maintaining cytotoxic drug concentrations within the CNS. Systemic
chemotherapy is affected by factors like the agent’s ability
to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the active transportation of the agent out of the CNS, and the distribution of the drug within the brain parenchyma.54 The
ability of high-dose AraC (1-7.5 g/m2) and high-dose
MTX (5-8 g/m2) to penetrate the BBB make them useful
agents for CNS prophylaxis in ALL.55-58 Cortes et al demonstrated the utility of high-dose MTX, AraC, and IT
AraC to prevent CNS recurrence in adults with ALL (Fig.
2).28 Using combined vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD), the authors compared a regimen with
no CNS prophylaxis (pre-VAD) with a series of modified
VAD regimens that included different prophylactic
modalities in 391 adult patients with ALL who were on 4
consecutive protocols (Fig, 2). Overall, the CNS recurrence rate fell from 31% among patients who did not
receive any CNS prophylaxis (pre-VAD) to 18%, 17%,
and 3% among patients who subsequently received VAD,
modified VAD, and hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide
plus VAD (hyper-CVAD) prophylactic modalities,
respectively.28 Those authors also concluded that early IT
chemotherapy was necessary to reduce the CNS recurrence rate in high-risk patients who had elevated lactate
dehydrogenase levels and a high proliferative index.
Corticosteroids have been an integral part of systemic CNS prophylaxis in patients with ALL. Prednisolone is used systematically to induce remission and in
maintenance therapy.59 Dexamethasone may offer greater
CNS protection than prednisone because of its superior
penetration and longer half-life in the CSF.60-63 The

adolescent patients with ALL has been demonstrated;
however, toxicity, including behavioral problems, myopathy, osteopenia, and excessive weight gain, were major
limitations to the use of systemic steroids for CNS prophylaxis in patients with ALL.63
Systemic chemotherapy alone is not adequate for
CNS prophylaxis; it is difficult to maintain prolonged
therapeutic concentrations of drug in the CSF. Furthermore, systemic therapy is associated with widespread
toxicities. High-dose AraC is associated with liver dysfunction, cerebellar dysfunction, mucositis, diarrhea,
rash, and fever.64 High-dose MTX is associated with renal
dysfunction, transient hepatitis, mucositis, and (rarely)
neurotoxicity.53
Poor penetration of the BBB, difficulty in achieving
and maintaining cytotoxic levels of systemic therapy in
the CSF, and adverse events after cranial radiation have
led to the need for alternative therapeutic strategies for
CNS prophylaxis in ALL. The objective of including IT
therapy in CNS prophylaxis protocols is to improve the

2294

IT chemotherapy has been used widely in the last
decade to treat CNS lymphoma and leukemia, because it
allows direct intra-CSF treatment and potentially sustained therapeutic drug concentration in the CSF.28,65
Commonly used IT therapies include MTX, AraC, liposomal AraC, and N,N0 N0 -triethylenethiophosphoramide.
IT chemotherapy in combination with systemic chemotherapy has produced successful results and can eliminate
the need for radiation.13 Modified regimens involve
repeated administration either of IT MTX or AraC alone
or of IT chemotherapy with a combination of systemic
MTX, AraC, and corticosteroids.9 The combination of
IT MTX with systemic high-dose MTX has been regarded
as a superior option for CNS-directed prophylactic therapy compared with IT MTX alone.66 In the absence of IT
therapy, isolated CNS recurrence can account for 10%
to 16% of recurrences,53 warranting the inclusion of
IT chemotherapy in CNS prophylactic regimens.
Pui et al demonstrated that early intensification of
IT chemotherapy, consisting of simultaneous administration of MTX, AraC, and hydrocortisone (triple IT),
resulted in a 5-year cumulative risk of an isolated CNS recurrence of only 1.2% and a cumulative risk of any CNS
recurrence of 3.2% in children with ALL.67 A multicenter
phase 2 trial of adults with ALL suggested that high-dose
AraC in combination with IT MTX was effective for
CNS prophylaxis, with a reported CNS recurrence rate of
only 3%.68 Triple IT therapy also was used recently in the
Dana Farber Cancer Institute 91-01 protocol in adults
with ALL who presented with positive CSF cytology
(16%).69 Patients received high-dose, systemic MTX during induction and received triple IT therapy during induction, intensification, and maintenance. Cranial radiation
also was given during induction. The CSF cleared in all
previously positive patients, and prophylaxis was tolerated
relatively well. The hyper-CVAD regimen also has been
adapted to incorporate CNS prophylaxis: Investigators
alternated 4 cycles of hyper-CVAD with 4 cycles of highdose MTX and high-dose AraC therapy accompanied by
IT MTX and AraC in adults with ALL. They reported
complete remission in 91% of patients, and the incidence
of CNS recurrence was only 4%.50 Other pediatric regimens that have been adapted for use in adolescent and
young adult patients with ALL are compared in Table

provided earlier and more intense CNS prophylaxis compared with the Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocol
and resulted in a lower CNS recurrence rate.
Liposomal AraC, a relatively new agent, is a sustained-release formulation of aqueous AraC that is encapsulated in spherical, multivesicular particles known as
DepoFoam.71 This agent is administered only intrathecally. The liposomal preparation provides a prolonged exposure of free AraC in the cerebrospinal compartment.
Exposure for an extended period is particularly important
because of the proliferation kinetics of leukemic cells in
the CNS.54,72 Earlier phase 1/2 studies established that
the administration of liposomal AraC resulted in the
maintenance of elevated AraC levels in the CSF for 14
days, requiring fewer lumbar punctures or intraventricular
administrations compared with conventional IT therapies
like MTX and AraC.73,74 Side effects commonly associated with liposomal AraC include headache, arachnoiditis, and confusion.71 Patients who receive liposomal AraC
should be given dexamethasone to mitigate the occurrence
of arachnoiditis.71
IT therapy often is given by lumbar puncture or by
direct intraventricular administration using an implantable device, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Both routes are
associated with complications. Lumbar puncture may be
time-consuming, can lead to suboptimal drug distribution throughout the neuraxis, and, in the case of traumatic
lumbar puncture, inadvertent introduction of drug into
the epidural or subdural space.35,75 Indeed, at our institution, we routinely administer IT chemotherapy by lumbar
puncture, because the procedure can be performed by
physicians or trained nurses and does not require any
neurology referral. Intraventricular administration is used
only in exceptional cases, such as when lumbar punctures
are contraindicated. Contraindication to Ommaya reser-

voir implantation include tumor presence at the intended
burr hole site,76 and patients with thrombocytopenia and
the risk of intravascular coagulation or clotting should be
evaluated preoperatively.77 Before device implantation,
patients should be evaluated for CSF flow obstructions
with an 111In-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid flow
study.78 Focal irradiation of the obstructed area can
restore normal flow; however, if flow is still abnormal,
then IT therapy should be avoided. The risks associated
with intraventricular administration involve surgical complications, including intracranial hemorrhage and catheter
complications, leading to infection and localized necrotizing leukoencephalopathy; however, it affords painless and
rapid administration compared with lumbar puncture.79
Infections can be prevented by the prophylactic use of
antibiotics before surgical catheter placement.78 Catheter
misplacement and its consequent effect on parenchymal
toxicity can be minimized by the intraoperative confirmation of catheter position with fluoroscopic guidance or
endoscopy.78
Maximizing the Use of Effective CNS
Prophylaxis Modalities
The most appropriate systemic chemotherapy to control
primary disease combined with systemic and IT CNS
prophylaxis have contributed to greatly reduced CNS
recurrence rates. To this end, studies have focused on therapeutic regimens that can achieve greater efficacy and
improved survival rates with reduced CNS recurrence.
Immunotherapy with rituximab, in conjunction with
hyper-CVAD and IT MTX and AraC, was proposed for
the treatment of adults with B-ALL. The results demonstrated a 3-year overall survival rate of 89%, an event-free
survival rate of 80%, and a disease-free survival rate of
88% with no isolated CNS recurrence.80 It should be

noted that 2 patients had evidence of CNS or leptomeningeal disease at presentation.
The therapeutic benefits and the reduced dosing frequency offered by liposomal AraC make it a promising
option as a CNS prophylactic treatment for adults with
ALL. It is believed that a lower dose intensity of liposomal
AraC may be effective and well tolerated in combination
with high-dose AraC and/or MTX. However, recent experience combining IT liposomal AraC with systemic
chemotherapies to prevent CNS recurrence has been
associated with several unexpected toxicities.
Jabbour and colleagues investigated the use of liposomal AraC for CNS prophylaxis in 31 adults with
ALL.81 The treatment regimen involved concomitant
administration of 50 mg of liposomal AraC on Days 2
and 15 of the hyper-CVAD regimen, which also included
systemic high-dose MTX and high-dose AraC on alternating courses. Liposomal AraC was administered by lumbar
puncture on Day 10 of the high-dose MTX and AraC
course. After a median of 4 IT administrations of liposomal AraC, neurologic complications occurred in 5
patients (16%) and included seizures, papilledema, cauda
equina syndrome, and encephalitis. Toxic events, such as
seizures, were extremely uncommon with hyper-CVAD
treatment and standard IT AraC; therefore, the neurotoxicity could be attributed in part to the long half-life of liposomal AraC in the CSF.82 Traumatic lumbar puncture
during the administration of liposomal AraC also has
been suggested as a possible contributor to the observed
neurotoxic effects.83
In contrast, in a retrospective analysis, McClune and
colleagues reported a more manageable safety profile
when using liposomal AraC for CNS prophylaxis in
adults with ALL.84 Liposomal AraC 50 mg was administered to patients (N ¼ 14) through an Ommaya reservoir
only once per cycle of the hyper-CVAD regimen. After
the occurrence of hyponatremia and somnolence in 1
patient, the dose of liposomal AraC was reduced to 25 mg
for all patients. After an 18-month follow-up, no CNS
recurrences were reported, and no patients discontinued
treatment because of the side effects associated with liposomal AraC. The investigators suggested that, when using
liposomal AraC prophylactically, the concomitant administration of local or systemic neurotoxic medications
should be avoided. Indeed, depending on the cycle in
which liposomal AraC is given, exposure to high-dose
AraC and high-dose MTX could prime the nervous system to any additional IT AraC, compounding the adverse
effects observed with liposomal AraC. Systemic high-dose

2296

AraC has been associated with neurologic complications,
such as seizures, cerebral dysfunction, and cerebellar syndrome, with an incidence of 14%.85
To further illustrate the importance of evaluating
the preconditioning of the CNS to adverse events with
liposomal AraC, Hilgendorf and colleagues administered
50 mg of liposomal AraC by lumbar puncture as CNS
prophylaxis to 6 patients with hematologic malignancies
after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (n
¼ 4 patients with ALL, n ¼ 1 patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, n ¼ 1 patient with Burkitt lymphoma).86
Two patients developed signs of sacral radiculopathy, 1 of
whom also developed irreversible cauda equina. Both
patients had a history of spinal cord surgery or subarachnoid hemorrhage that may have disrupted CSF flow.
Uninterrupted CSF flow, as highlighted above, is an
essential precondition for successful IT therapy, as is careful evaluation of any preexisting CNS toxicities. It is suggested that liposomal AraC not be administered before or
concomitant with high-dose, systemic chemotherapy but,
rather, after such systemic treatment.87 Thus, the optimal
interval between the administration of systemic chemotherapy that penetrates the BBB and IT chemotherapy
remains to be determined. Clearly, additional studies
controlling for these factors are necessary to maximize
the efficacy of available CNS prophylactic therapies
while avoiding serious toxicities.
Those patients who do develop recurrent disease are
afforded treatment options similar in method to CNS
prophylaxis. Systemic therapies like high-dose MTX and/
or AraC are able to treat both leptomeningeal and parenchymal metastases but necessarily are associated with
higher systemic toxicities. IT administration of these
agents also is a viable treatment option. In a subanalysis of
the international United Kingdom MRC ALL/ECOG
2993 trial, the outcome of adults with ALL who had CNS
involvement at diagnosis was analyzed.16 Patients were
treated on protocol in addition to IT or intraventricular
MTX (12.5 mg) 3 times per week with the option of providing cranial irradiation at the physicians’ discretion. After induction and intensification, patients received either
consolidation/maintenance or HSCT. Both chemotherapy and HSCT resulted in a 29% 5-year overall survival
rate compared with 38% in patients without CNS
involvement at diagnosis, and patients with Ph-negative
ALL could achieve a relatively long-term disease-free survival. Ph-positive ALL is more common in adults than in
children with ALL and is relatively treatment-resistant.88,89 Allogenic transplantation remains the standard

of treatment for these patients.90 The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib also is accepted treatment but fails to
penetrate the BBB to the CSF, resulting in a 20% CNS recurrence rate.91 More recently, it was demonstrated that
another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, penetrated
the CSF, making it a promising candidate for the treatment of CNS leukemia.92 This supports both conventional and targeted chemotherapy and HSCT as viable
treatment options for patients with CNS metastases.
Most important to effective treatment outcome of CNS
metastases is the early diagnosis of disease. However, the
difficulties associated with early diagnosis, including possible traumatic lumbar punctures to assess CSF cytology
and unfamiliarity with the early signs and symptoms of
NM, make prophylaxis the best first-line option in managing CNS metastases from ALL.
Conclusions
Clinical trials that involve pediatric or adult patients with
ALL consistently have highlighted the need for more
effective strategies to prevent CNS involvement to achieve
longer event-free survival and cure rates. Currently, early
and frequent IT therapy combined with systemic chemotherapy is the most effective approach for reducing CNS
recurrence. Because of the toxicity associated with CNS
prophylactic therapies, it is important to carefully evaluate
and identify the appropriate patient groups that will benefit from the different prophylactic modalities. Newer
agents that can maintain a prolonged therapeutic level in
the CSF will be beneficial candidates for CNS prophylaxis. Further study and monitoring of the therapeutic regimens are needed to establish the most effective agents
and regimens to prevent CNS recurrence in adults with
ALL.
