Abstract
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common cancer predisposition syndrome in which affected individuals
develop benign and malignant nerve tumors. The NF1 gene product neurofibromin negatively regulates Ras
and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, prompting clinical trials to evaluate the ability of Ras
and mTOR pathway inhibitors to arrest NF1-associated tumor growth. To discover other downstream targets
of neurofibromin, we performed an unbiased cell-based high-throughput chemical library screen using
NF1-deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells. We identified the natural product,
cucurbitacin-I ( JSI-124), which inhibited NF1-deficient cell growth by inducing apoptosis. We further showed
that signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), the target of cucurbitacin-I inhibition, was
hyperactivated in NF1-deficient primary astrocytes and neural stem cells, mouse glioma cells, and human
MPNST cells through Ser727 phosphorylation, leading to increased cyclin D1 expression. STAT3 was regulated
in NF1-deficient cells of murine and human origin in a TORC1- and Rac1-dependent manner. Finally,
cucurbitacin-I inhibited the growth of NF1-deficient MPNST cells in vivo. In summary, we used a chemical
genetics approach to reveal STAT3 as a novel neurofibromin/mTOR pathway signaling molecule, define its
action and regulation, and establish STAT3 as a tractable target for future NF1-associated cancer therapy
studies. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1356–66. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic causes for nervous system tumors, and affected
patients develop both benign and malignant tumors involving the brain and peripheral nerves (1). Within the central
nervous system, low-grade gliomas of the optic pathway
are observed in 15% of children with NF1 (2), whereas adults
with NF1 develop high-grade astrocytomas at a 50-fold increased incidence (3). In addition, benign peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (neurofibromas) and malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are seen in patients with
NF1 (4).

With the identification of the NF1 gene in 1990, several investigators found that the NF1 gene product neurofibromin
functions primarily as a negative regulator of the RAS protooncogene such that NF1 gene inactivation in tumors is
associated with increased RAS pathway activation and cell
proliferation (5–7). Further studies showed that inhibition
of RAS function reduces NF1-deficient cell and tumor growth
in vitro and in vivo (8, 9). These exciting observations led to
the initiation of clinical trials using anti-RAS biologicallybased therapies, including farnesyltransferase inhibitors
(FTI), to treat tumors arising in patients with NF1. Unfortunately, FTI therapy has shown little efficacy in the treatment
of NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma (10).
In light of the limited success of FTI monotherapy in NF1
clinical trials and the fact that RAS activation can mediate
cell growth through a multitude of effector proteins, we previously used an unbiased proteomic method to identify neurofibromin/RAS downstream effector proteins that might
serve as improved targets for therapeutic drug design. Using
this approach, we found that neurofibromin/RAS growth regulation requires mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
function (11). Similar findings were also reported by others
(12), prompting preclinical studies with rapamycin showing
their efficacy in vivo (13–15).
In an effort to more precisely define the signaling effectors
downstream of mTOR that mediate neurofibromin tumor

NF1 Growth Regulation Requires STAT3 Activation

suppression, we have previously shown that mTOR-dependent growth control requires Rac1 activation in NF1-deficient
cells (16). Unfortunately, because there are few Rac1-specific
pharmaceutical-grade inhibitors suitable for preclinical/clinical study, we next sought to identify additional targets in
NF1-deficient cells by means of high-throughput chemical library screening. Using this approach, we identified one previously unrecognized compound (cucurbitacin-I) and found
that cucurbitacin-I inhibits human NF1-deficient MPNST
and mouse Nf1−/− astrocyte growth in vitro. Because cucurbitacin-I is a potent inhibitor of signal transducer and activator
of transcription-3 (STAT3) function, we next showed that
STAT3 is hyperactivated in Nf1−/− primary astrocytes and
that STAT3 hyperactivation in NF1-deficient cells results
from increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/
mTOR/Rac1 pathway signaling. Lastly, we showed that
STAT3 inhibition by cucurbitacin-I blocks human MPNST
growth in vivo. Collectively, these findings provide novel
insights into neurofibromin growth control and identify
an exciting novel target for future NF1-associated tumor
therapeutic drug design.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Six- to 8-wk-old male nu/nu mice were purchased
from Taconic Laboratories. Nf1flox/flox mice were intercrossed
to generate Nf1flox/flox pups, whereas Nf1flox/flox and Nf1flox/wt;
GFAP-Cre mice were intercrossed to generate mice lacking
Nf1 gene expression in GFAP+ (glial) cells (Nf1GFAPCKO mice),
as previously described (17, 18). All mice were used in accordance with established animal study protocols at the Washington University School of Medicine.
Cell lines. The NF1-deficient ST88-14 MPNST cell line was
kindly provided by Dr. Jeff DeClue [National Cancer Institute
(NCI), Bethesda, MD]. These cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin.
Primary astrocytes. Forebrain astrocyte cell cultures from
postnatal day 2 Nf1flox/flox mice were generated as previously
described (16, 18, 19). Adenovirus type 5 containing β-galactosidase (Ad5-LacZ) and Cre recombinase (Ad5-Cre; University of Iowa Gene Transfer Core, Iowa City, IA) were used to
produce wild-type (WT) and Nf1-deficient (Nf1−/−) astrocytes,
respectively, and neurofibromin loss was confirmed by
immunoblot analysis 5 d after infection (data not shown;
ref. 19). All experiments were performed on passage 1 or 2
astrocyte cultures.
Pharmacologic inhibitors. Rapamycin (LC Laboratories),
LY294002 (Calbiochem), and JSI-124 (Calbiochem) were
used. Treatments were for 16 to 18 h unless otherwise indicated. Experiments were performed at least thrice with identical results.
High-throughput chemical library screening. The highthroughput compound screen was performed with a cell
growth and viability assay in black, clear-bottomed, 96-well
culture plates (Corning Costar) using a Beckman Coulter
Core robotics system, including a FX liquid handler, controlled by the Sagian graphical method development tool

www.aacrjournals.org

(SAMI scheduling software). NF1-deficient ST88-14 cells were
seeded in 100 μL/well DMEM supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS and 1% glutamine (5,000 cells per well).
Plates were maintained in an environmentally-controlled Cytomat incubator until needed for operations, thereby optimizing health and uniform treatment of all plates.
Compounds from the NCI 2000 Diversity Set I (in DMSO)
were dissolved to 5 μmol/L final concentration in DMEM
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% glutamine and added to cells 24 h after cell plating by exchanging
the medium. Compound addition was performed with a 96multichannel head on the FX liquid handler. Compounds
were laid out in columns 2 to 11 of each plate. Control wells
for DMSO (0.25% final concentration) and two concentrations of rapamycin (10 and 100 nmol/L) were placed in columns 1 and 12. Plates were maintained in the Cytomat
incubator for 48 h. Cell viability was then determined with
resazurin dye (final concentration, 44 μmol/L; Sigma) after
a 3-h incubation at 37°C as monitored on a FLUOstar
OPTIMA fluorescence reader (excitation, 544 nm; emission,
590 nm; BMG Labtech).
Statistical analysis and “hit” selection. Cell viability data
acquired 48 h after drug treatment were normalized by dividing treatment fluorescence values by untreated control
(DMSO) values. Data were then averaged over three compound replicates. We used two different statistical methods
to analyze the data: first, on a plate-by-plate analysis, because
the median absolute deviation (MAD) analysis is median
based and is more robust for outliers (20). A hit was defined
as values (α) less than −4 MAD from the median (20). A secondary criterion involved the application of a percentile analysis. A hit was defined as less than the 7th percentile
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Compounds meeting both criteria
were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Table S1).
Compounds of interest were selected by review of published
structures and literature; those chosen for further characterization are shown in Supplementary Table S2.
Cell proliferation. ST88-14 cells were plated (20,000 per
well) in 24-well dishes and allowed to adhere for 24 h followed
by treatment with cucurbitacin-I for another 18 h. Cells were
exposed to [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/mL) for 4 h. Astrocytes (105)
were allowed to adhere for 24 h in 24-well dishes and maintained in serum-free DMEM for 24 h before exposure to [3H]
thymidine (1 μCi/mL). [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by scintillation counting (11).
Detection of apoptotic cells. NF1-deficient ST88-14 cells
were seeded (50,000 per well) in 24-well dishes and treated
with cucurbitacin-I for 18 h. The cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice, and the apoptotic cells were detected using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
kit (Roche). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI). Representative photomicrographs
were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon
Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope) equipped with a digital
camera (Optronics). Apoptotic cells were quantified by
counting the number of TUNEL-positive cells as a percentage

of the total number of DAPI-stained cells in the field. At least
250 cells were counted.
Immunocytochemistry. WT and Nf1−/− astrocytes (P2)
were seeded in 24-well dishes (50,000 cells per well) in astrocyte growth medium for 24 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with
100% methanol, and blocked for 1 h in 5% goat serum/0.3%
Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature. To identify phospho-STAT3–expressing cells, astrocytes were incubated with
a rabbit anti–phospho-STAT3 (Ser727) antibody (1:100 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) in 1% bovine serum albumin/0.3% PBS–Triton X-100 in PBS overnight at 4°C. Alexa
Fluor 488–conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody
(1:200 dilution; Molecular Probes) was used for detection.
Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Immunolabeling
was visualized using the avidin-biotin conjugation method
(1:500 dilution; Vectastain ABC Elite, Vector Labs) and
3,3′-diaminobenzidine tablets (Sigma). Photomicrographs
were obtained using a fluorescence Nikon Eclipse TE300
inverted microscope equipped with a digital camera
(Optronics).
Retroviral and lentiviral constructs and viral delivery. Mouse-specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviruses
were purchased from Sigma. Raptor (NM_028898; TRCN‐
0000077472) lentivirus was produced, and the most effective
silencing construct was selected for further study as previously reported (21). Raptor silencing in ST88-14 cells was
achieved following three infections with lentivirus. Empty
pLKO.1 virus was used as a control.
Murine stem cell virus (MSCV) containing mTOR small
interfering RNA (siRNA), constitutively active Rac1
(Rac1V12), or dominant-negative Rac1 (Rac1N17) was generated following 293T cell transfection with τ-helper DNA using Fugene HD (Roche; ref. 16). Forty-eight hours later,
virus-containing supernatants were filtered through 0.45μm syringe filters. Cells were infected thrice and harvested
72 h later. MSCV expressing green fluorescent protein was
included as a control.
Western blotting. Cells were lysed in standard NP40 lysis
buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for Western
blotting as previously described (16). All antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and used at a
1:1,000 dilution unless otherwise stated. Primary Rac1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Following
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology) incubation, detection was accomplished by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham
Biosciences). Densitometry analysis was performed with
Gel-Pro Analyzer 4.0 software (Media Cybernetics) using
α-tubulin (Sigma) or non–phospho-STAT3, AKT, and S6
antibodies for normalization.
Rac1 activation assay. GTP-bound Rac1 was measured
using a Rac activation kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions (16). Briefly, ST88-14
cells were lysed, incubated with PAK1-PBD–conjugated
agarose beads, washed in lysis buffer, and boiled in 2×
Laemmli buffer, and bound protein (active Rac1) was separated by SDS-PAGE gels for Western blotting. An aliquot

1358

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

of the lysate was saved for Western blotting to ensure
equal protein loading.
Immunohistochemical analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation. The human glioma tissue microarray (TMA) slides,
containing triplicate cores from 34 patients with sporadic
pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), 13 with NF1-associated PA,
and 5 cases of normal brain tissue (22), were used in accordance with approved human study protocols. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously published
(18). Phospho-STAT3 (Ser 727 ) antibody was used at a
1:100 dilution, and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The slides were examined independently by
two investigators blinded to both the clinical and the
pathologic data. Tumors were scored as “positive” if they
contained >10% immunoreactive cells or “negative” if they
contained <10% immunopositive cells. A tumor was only
scored as positive or negative if there was concordance
between the three cores representing the same tumor
on the TMA.
In vivo tumor implantation. One million ST88-14 cells in
a total volume of 200 μL were injected s.c. into the right flank
of 6- to 8-wk-old male athymic nu/nu mice. Tumors were allowed to grow until they became palpable, and then animals
were randomly assigned to two groups. Five mice in each
group received daily i.p. injections of vehicle (10% ethanol)
or drug (1 mg/kg JSI-124 in 10% ethanol) for a total of 5 d.
Twice weekly, body weights were recorded and tumor sizes
were measured by Vernier caliper. Tumor volume (mm3) was
calculated using the following equation: (L × W2)/2, where L
represents the longest dimension and W the shortest dimension of the tumor (23). Following 5 d of treatment, mice were
euthanized and their tumors were removed. Apoptotic cell
death was detected using a terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) kit in postfixed tumor sections. Statistical significance was evaluated
using the Student's t test.

Results
Cucurbitacin-I is a novel inhibitor of NF1-deficient cell
growth. To identify previously unrecognized downstream
targets of neurofibromin relevant to growth regulation, we
used high-throughput chemical library screening (Fig. 1A).
This high-throughput screening was based on inhibition
of NF1-deficient ST88-14 cell proliferation using DMSO
(0.25%) and two concentrations of rapamycin (10 and
100 nmol/L) as internal negative and positive controls,
respectively. We identified several candidate inhibitors but
only one novel chemical, cucurbitacin-I. We therefore chose
cucurbitacin-I for more detailed study. To validate the effect
of cucurbitacin-I on NF1-deficient cell growth, we used [3H]
thymidine and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation:
cucurbitacin-I (10 nmol/L) reduced ST88-14 proliferation,
as measured by either [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1B)
or BrdUrd incorporation (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Moreover,
cucurbitacin-I also inhibited ST88-14 anchorage-independent
cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S2B).

NF1 Growth Regulation Requires STAT3 Activation

Figure 1. Cucurbitacin-I inhibits NF1-deficient cell growth. A, top, ST88-14 cells were treated with the various compounds in all wells of the 96-well
plates, except in columns 1 and 12, where ST88-14 cells were treated either with DMSO (0.25%) or with two concentrations of rapamycin (10 and
100 nmol/L); bottom, chemical structure of cucurbitacin-I. B, cucurbitacin-I treatment reduced ST88-14 cell growth by 30% as measured by [3H]thymidine
incorporation (P < 0.001). C, representative TUNEL labeling photomicrographs show increased numbers of apoptotic ST88-14 cells following cucurbitacin-I
treatment (arrows denote TUNEL-positive cells). The percentages of TUNEL-labeled cells were presented as the mean ± SD of three fields from
different separate experiments. Asterisks (*) denote statistically significant differences from vehicle-treated ST88-14 cells. Magnification, ×20. Scale bar,
100 μm. D, top, STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation is reduced by 10-fold in ST88-14 cells following treatment with cucurbitacin-I. STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation
was not detected following 1-min exposure. Bottom, no changes in STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation were observed. Total STAT3 protein expression
was used as a protein loading control.

To extend these findings to other Nf1-deficient cell populations, we showed that cucurbitacin-I (10 nmol/L) inhibited
Nf1−/− astrocyte proliferation (Fig. 2B), with minimal effects
on WT astrocytes. Similarly, cucurbitacin-I treatment reduced the proliferation of Nf1-deficient mouse low-grade
K1861 glioma cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A).

To determine whether this reduced cell growth reflected
increased cell death, we measured apoptosis in ST88-14 cells
treated with 10 nmol/L cucurbitacin-I using the TUNEL assay. Cucurbitacin-I treatment increased the percentage of
TUNEL-positive ST88-14 cells by 8-fold compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1C). Identical results were also observed

using K1861 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These findings
show that cucurbitacin-I decreases NF1-deficient cell growth
by inducing apoptosis.
Cucurbitacin-I inhibits STAT3 activation in NF1deficient cells. One of the mechanisms underlying cucurbitacin-I function is inhibition of STAT3 function (24, 25).
Because neurofibromin has not previously been implicated
in STAT3 regulation, we first measured STAT3 activation using phospho-specific antibodies. Cucurbitacin-I treatment of
ST88-14 cells (Fig. 1D, top) or K1861 mouse glioma cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3C) resulted in suppression of STAT3
activation, as reflected by reduced phosphorylation on
Ser727. In contrast, no change in STAT3 Tyr705 phosphoryla-

tion was observed (Fig. 1D, bottom). Identical results were
obtained using a commercial source of cucurbitacin-I
(JSI-124; data not shown).
Second, to directly show that neurofibromin regulates
STAT3 activation, we examined STAT3 phosphorylation in
Nf1−/− and WT astrocytes: STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation
was increased 4.8-fold in Nf1−/− compared with WT astrocytes (Fig. 2A, top). Similar results were observed using brain
lysates from Nf1GFAPCKO mice lacking Nf1 expression in
GFAP+ astrocytes: Compared with Nf1flox/flox (“WT”) mice,
Nf1GFAPCKO mouse brains exhibited 5-fold greater STAT3
(Ser727) phosphorylation in vivo (Fig. 2A, bottom). No STAT3
Tyr 7 05 hyperphosphorylation was observed in Nf1 − /−

Figure 2. Cucurbitacin-I inhibits STAT3 activation in Nf1-deficient astrocytes. A, top, STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation is increased 3-fold in Nf1−/− relative

STAT3 expression was used as a protein loading control. Right, increased nuclear STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation is observed in Nf1−/− relative to WT
astrocytes by immunocytochemistry. Magnification, ×20. Scale bar, 100 μm. B, cucurbitacin-I treatment reduces Nf1−/− astrocyte proliferation as assessed
by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Asterisks (*) denote statistically significant differences from vehicle-treated Nf1−/− astrocytes. C, STAT3 Ser727
phosphorylation was decreased following cucurbitacin-I treatment in Nf1−/− astrocytes (quantitation shown below). D, representative photomicrographs

NF1 Growth Regulation Requires STAT3 Activation

Figure 3. STAT3 activation is regulated by mTOR in NF1-deficient cells in vitro. A, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibits ST88-14 STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation.
Phospho-AKT antibodies were used to show PI3K activity. Total AKT and STAT3 served as loading controls. B, left, rapamycin inhibited STAT3 Ser727
phosphorylation and resulted in increased AKT Ser473 phosphorylation. Phospho-S6 was used to show mTOR activity. Total S6, AKT, and STAT3
serve as internal loading controls. Right, GTP-bound Rac1 was immunoprecipitated from ST88-14 cells treated with vehicle (ethanol) or rapamycin (10 and
100 nmol/L) using PAK1-PBD affinity chromatography. Equal protein loading was confirmed by total Rac1 immunoblotting. GTP-bound Rac1 activation
was decreased in rapamycin-treated cells. STAT3 Ser727 and S6 phosphorylation were also reduced by rapamycin treatment. C, siRNA-mediated mTOR
knockdown inhibited STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation. Total STAT3 and α-tubulin served as loading controls. D, raptor silencing by shRNAi inhibited ST88-14
STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation and resulted in increased AKT Ser473 phosphorylation. α-Tubulin, AKT, and STAT3 served as loading controls.

astrocytes compared with WT astrocytes (data not shown).
In addition, primary Nf1−/− neocortical neural stem cells likewise exhibited increased STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation relative to their WT counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Because STAT3 activation (phosphorylation) is associated
with its translocation to the nucleus, we found that Nf1−/−
astrocytes had greater nuclear STAT3 immunostaining compared with WT astrocytes (Fig. 2A, right).
Third, to show that cucurbitacin-I inhibits Nf1−/− astrocyte
cell proliferation as well as STAT3 activation, we examined
the effect of cucurbitacin-I treatment on [3H]thymidine incorporation and STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation in WT and
Nf1−/− astrocytes. We observed a 1.4-fold reduction in cell
proliferation (Fig. 2B) and a 3-fold reduction in Ser727 STAT3
phosphorylation (Fig. 2C) in Nf1-deficient astrocytes following cucurbitacin-I treatment. The effects of cucurbitacin-I

treatment on Nf1-deficient astrocyte proliferation were similar to those observed following STAT3 shRNA inhibitor
(shRNAi) knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
Finally, to determine whether STAT3 is also activated in
brain tumors from patients with NF1, we examined STAT3
Ser727 phosphorylation by immunohistochemistry in NF1associated and sporadic PAs: Whereas 41% of NF1-associated
PAs were phospho-STAT3 immunopositive, only 7% of the
sporadic PAs were phospho-STAT3 immunoreactive
(Fig. 2D). No phospho-STAT3 Ser727 expression was detected
in the normal brain tissue specimens (n = 5). Collectively,
these data show that neurofibromin is a negative regulator
of STAT3 activity in vitro and in vivo.
STAT3 activation is regulated by mTOR in NF1-deficient
cells. We next sought to determine how neurofibromin regulates STAT3. Our previous studies showed that neurofibromin

astrocyte growth control is mediated by AKT/mTOR pathway
signaling (11, 16). Here, we showed that pharmacologic inhibition of either PI3K (LY294002; Fig. 3A) or mTOR (rapamycin; Fig. 3B, left) blocked STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation in
ST88-14 cells. Second, we showed that rapamycin blocks
STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation (activation) in both human
ST88-14 and mouse K1861 cells (Fig. 3B, right; Supplementary
Fig. S3D) as well as Rac1 activation in ST88-14 cells (Fig. 3B,
right). Third, we genetically silenced mTOR expression using
a mTOR-specific siRNA virus in ST88-14 cells and found reduced STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation following mTOR knockdown (Fig. 3C). Identical results were also observed following
rapamycin inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S5A) or mTOR
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S5B) in Nf1−/− astrocytes.
Fourth, because rapamycin-sensitive mTOR signaling operates largely through mTOR complex 1 (TORC1), we silenced
the major TORC1 protein raptor in ST88-14 cells using
shRNAi: Raptor knockdown also reduced STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). Consistent with TORC1-negative regu-

lation of AKT activity, we also observed increased AKT Ser473
phosphorylation (activation) in ST88-14 cells following both
rapamycin (Fig. 3B, left) and raptor shRNAi knockdown
(Fig. 3D).
Fifth, based on our studies showing that mTOR regulates
Nf1−/− astrocyte growth in a Rac1-dependent manner (16), we
examined STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation in ST88-14 cells following the introduction of a constitutively activate Rac1 mutant (Rac1 V12 ) or a dominant-inhibitory Rac1 mutant
(Rac1N17): Rac1V12 increased STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation
(Fig. 4A), whereas Rac1N17 attenuated STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Similarly, Rac1N17 expression in Nf1−/−
astrocytes reduced STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S5C, bottom), whereas Rac1 V12 expression
in WT astrocytes increased STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. S5C, top). Lastly, as we previously reported
(16), active Rac1V12 expression increased ST88-14 cell growth
(Supplementary Fig. S6A), whereas dominant-inhibitory
Rac1N17 expression reduced both ST88-14 (Supplementary

NF1 Growth Regulation Requires STAT3 Activation

Figure 5. JSI-124 treatment reduced NF1-deficient tumor growth in vivo.
A, representative tumor sizes (arrows) are shown for each treatment group.
B, tumor volumes were calculated from tumor measurements obtained on
the indicated days. Tumor volumes were reduced by ∼4-fold (P ≤ 0.008) in
mice following 5 d of treatment. C, JSI-124 treatment increased apoptosis
in vivo by 2-fold relative to vehicle treatment. The percent of TUNEL-positive
cells is presented as the mean ± SD of 10 fields from either JSI-124–treated
or vehicle-treated mice. Asterisks (*) denote statistically significant
(P < 0.0001) differences from vehicle-treated mice.

Fig. S6B) and Nf1−/− astrocyte cell proliferation (Supplementary
Fig. S6C). Together, these data show that mTOR/Rac1 activation regulates STAT3 function in NF1-deficient cells.
STAT3 regulates cyclin D1 expression in NF1-deficient
cells. To determine whether STAT3 regulates cyclin D1 expression (26), cyclin D1 levels were measured following cucurbitacin-I treatment. Cyclin D1 expression was reduced
in ST88-14 cells (Fig. 4C) and Nf1−/− astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S5D) after cucurbitacin-I treatment. Because cyclin
D1 is increased following Rac1V12 expression (Fig. 4A) and
decreased following Rac1N17 expression (Fig. 4B), we conclude that STAT3 regulation of cyclin D1 resulted from
Rac1 activation in NF1-deficient cells.
STAT3 inhibition inhibits ST88-14 tumor growth in vivo.
To provide in vivo support for STAT3-mediated NF1 growth
control, we used JSI-124 to inhibit STAT3 function in ST88-14
tumor explants. Fifteen days after implantation, male nu/nu
mice with visibly growing tumors were randomly assigned to
daily i.p. injections of either JSI-124 (1 mg/kg) or vehicle for
5 days. After 5 days, tumors in the JSI-124–treated group
were ∼4-fold smaller than those from the vehicle-treated
group (P ≤ 0.008; Fig. 5A and B). Next, to determine whether
the decrease in tumor growth reflected increased cell death,
we measured apoptosis in frozen tumor sections and found a
2-fold increase in apoptosis following JSI-124 treatment (P <

0.0001; Fig. 5C). Similar results were also obtained in a
second independent study (Supplementary Fig. S7A). No
effect of JSI-124 treatment on animal body weight (Supplementary Fig. S7B) or apoptosis in the liver (data not shown)
was observed. These results show that STAT3 inhibition
results in decreased NF1-deficient cell and tumor growth
in vitro and in vivo.

Discussion
The identification of the NF1 gene and the subsequent discovery that neurofibromin regulates the RAS/mTOR pathway
have ushered in a new era of biologically-targeted therapies
for NF1-associated tumors. In this regard, clinical studies using RAS inhibitors have already been initiated and those focused on mTOR blockade have recently commenced.
Unfortunately, RAS inhibition using FTIs has not shown efficacy for the treatment of NF1-associated peripheral nerve
sheath tumors (10). Based on these studies, subsequent
translational research has focused on RAS downstream effectors, including Raf/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase kinase and AKT/mTOR. Several
laboratories have recently shown that hyperactivation of
the mTOR pathway underlies the growth advantage seen
in NF1-deficient glioma and MPNST cells and that mTOR

inhibition, using the macrolide rapamycin, results in decreased optic glioma and MPNST growth in vivo (13–15).
However, it is worth noting that rapamycin does not induce
apoptosis and does not lead to a durable response following
drug cessation (13). In addition, human MPNST cells grown
as explants in mice exhibit increased AKT activation following rapamycin treatment as a result of mTOR-mediated AKT
phosphorylation (15). Although rapamycin analogues are
now in clinical trial for human NF1-associated peripheral
nerve sheath tumors, this biologically-based therapy may
not result in sustained tumor shrinkage.
For these reasons, we sought to discover new targets using
an unbiased high-throughput chemical library screening approach. In this screen, we found several promising compounds. A number of our top candidates were known
chemotherapeutic agents (mitomycin, daunorubicin, and topotecan), whereas others were crude inhibitors of major biological processes (bouvardin, tubulosine, and breflate). Only
one compound, cucurbitacin-I, was novel and was therefore
selected for further study. Additionally, we chose cucurbitacin-I because it is known to inhibit STAT3, a signaling molecule not previously implicated in neurofibromin growth
control, and against which inhibitors have been used to treat
other cancers (27, 28). Consistent with these other reports,
we found that cucurbitacin-I blocked the proliferation of
Nf1−/− astrocytes in vitro and NF1-deficient MPNST cells by
suppressing STAT3 activation in vitro and in vivo.
STAT3 is a transcription factor whose activity is regulated
by phosphorylation: Tyrosine phosphorylation (residue
Tyr705) results in STAT3 dimerization and translocation to
the nucleus, whereas transcriptional activation requires
phosphorylation on residue Ser727 (29). In NF1-deficient cells,
we observed increased phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727
and not Tyr705. This is consistent with previous reports showing that RAS activation increases STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation (26). Moreover, phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 is
sufficient for STAT3 activation in prostate cancer cells, independent of Tyr705 phosphorylation (30), and STAT3 Ser727
phosphorylation is essential for postnatal survival and cell
growth in mice, such that mice with a Stat3 allele in which
the serine residue has been converted to alanine exhibit increased apoptosis (31).
Because neurofibromin has never been shown to regulate
STAT3 activity, we sought to determine whether STAT3 was
deregulated in NF1-deficient cells through previously implicated neurofibromin signaling pathways. We found that
STAT3 activity was regulated in NF1-deficient primary cells
and tumor cells in an AKT/mTOR-dependent manner. Although unique to neurofibromin/AKT/mTOR pathway regulation, STAT3 hyperactivation is mediated by PI3K/AKT
signaling in other cell types (32). Based on our previous studies
showing that AKT/mTOR growth regulation in Nf1-deficient
astrocytes results from mTOR-mediated Rac1 activation, we
show that STAT3 activation is controlled by Rac1 activation
downstream of mTOR in Nf1−/− mouse astrocytes and NF1deficient human MPNST cells. The finding that Rac1 controls
STAT3 function in NF1-deficient cells is supported by previous
studies showing that Rac1 can bind to STAT3 and regulate

1364

STAT3 activation (33–36). Together, our findings establish a
more complete model for neurofibromin growth regulation involving mTOR/Rac1/STAT3 signaling (Fig. 4D).
STAT3 plays a central role in regulating oncogenesis by
controlling the transcription of several target genes essential
for cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and proliferation (37). In
this regard, Ser727 STAT3 phosphorylation is associated with
increased cyclin D1 expression (26); we found that cyclin D1
expression was increased in Nf1-deficient astrocytes relative
to WT astrocytes and was reduced following either Rac1 or
STAT3 inhibition. Whereas cyclin D1 may be partly responsible for promoting cell growth in NF1-deficient cells, other
STAT3 target genes, including regulators of apoptosis, are
likely involved in facilitating malignant transformation and
continued growth following neurofibromin loss. Additional
studies will be required to identify and validate these other
potential STAT3 transcriptional target genes.
Our finding that neurofibromin regulates STAT3 activation
in primary Nf1−/− astrocytes, neural stem cells, and low-grade
glioma cells coupled with the observation that STAT3 inhibition blocks Nf1-deficient astrocyte and low-grade glioma cell
proliferation has particular relevance to brain tumors in children with NF1. Previously, we have shown that optic glioma
growth in Nf1 genetically-engineered mice can be suppressed
by treatment with rapamycin; however, this inhibitor is only
cytostatic and murine optic glioma growth resumes following the cessation of rapamycin treatment (13). The observation that STAT3 blockade results in apoptosis is exciting, as
this antitumor effect might result in a durable response similar to what we have observed in Nf1 optic glioma mice treated with conventional genotoxic therapy (temozolomide).
Moreover, the potential use of STAT3 inhibitors for antiglioma therapy is underscored by results from numerous preclinical studies using high-grade glioma cell lines (25, 38–42).
Finally, it is conceivable that STAT3 blockade could be combined with currently used brain tumor therapies to improve
outcome. In this regard, JSI-124 treatment has been shown to
sensitize glioma cells to temozolomide, nitrosourea, and cisplatin in a synergistic manner (43). The ability to use STAT3
inhibitors to reduce the overall dose of alkylating chemotherapy is highly attractive, especially in children whose developing brains are most sensitive to the untoward effects of
chemotherapy. Future studies will be required to explore
these possibilities and to develop potential strategies to integrate STAT3 adjuvant therapies into our current treatment
approach to NF1-associated brain tumors.
