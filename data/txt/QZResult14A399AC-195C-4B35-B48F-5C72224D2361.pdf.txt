ABSTRACT
We retrospectively analyzed PDL1 mRNA expression in 306 breast cancer
samples, including 112 samples of an aggressive form, inflammatory breast cancer
(IBC). PDL1 expression was heterogeneous, but was higher in IBC than in non-IBC.
Compared to normal breast samples, PDL1 was overexpressed in 38% of IBC. In
IBC, PDL1 overexpression was associated with estrogen receptor-negative status,
basal and ERBB2-enriched aggressive subtypes, and clinico-biological signs of antitumor T-cell cytotoxic response. PDL1 overexpression was associated with better
pathological response to chemotherapy, independently of histo-clinical variables and
predictive gene expression signatures. No correlation was found with metastasis-free
and overall specific survivals. In conclusion, PDL1 overexpression in IBC correlated
with better response to chemotherapy. This seemingly counterintuitive correlation
between expression of an immunosuppressive molecule and improved therapeutic
response may be resolved if PDL1 expression is viewed as a surrogate marker of
a strong antitumor immune response among patients treated with immunogenic
chemotherapy. In such patients, PDL1 inhibition could protect activated T-cells or
reactivate inhibited T-cells and improve the therapeutic response, notably when
associated with immunogenic chemotherapy.

ERBB2-positivity [3, 4]. However, the 5-year survival
remains inferior to 40%. Even more than in non-IBC,
the identification of new therapeutic targets is crucial
in IBC, justifying the biological studies published
for many decades [5, 6] and recently based on highthroughput molecular analyses [7].
The importance of immunity has emerged in breast
cancer more recently than in other cancers. Several
immune response-related variables have a favorable
predictive impact in terms of survival and response to
chemotherapy in non-IBC [8–17]. Immune response
is a complex phenomenon balanced between activator
and inhibitor pathways. Cancer cells can maintain an
immunosuppressive microenvironment that favors

INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive
form of breast cancer with strong metastatic potential
[1, 2]. Nearly 60% of patients die from metastatic
relapse despite a multidisciplinary treatment including
anthracycline/taxane-based neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
(combined with trastuzumab for ERBB2-positive cases),
followed by radical surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy.
Pathological complete response (pCR) to neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy (obtained in 15–30% of cases) is a
favorable prognostic feature. Adjuvant systemic
therapy includes hormone therapy for estrogen receptor
(ER)-positive tumors and trastuzumab in case of

tumor progression. Programmed cell death 1 (PD1)
receptor-ligand interaction is a major inhibitor pathway.
Programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1 or CD274), one of
the ligands of PD1, is expressed at the surface of many
cancer and immune cells such as antigen-presenting
cells. Its binding to PD1 suppresses T-cell migration,
proliferation and secretion of cytotoxic mediators, and
restricts tumor cell killing [18–24]. PDL1 is upregulated
in many different cancers and its blocking enhances anticancer immunity. Clinical trials testing anti-PD1 or antiPDL1 drugs have shown promising results with durable
responses in different cancers including melanoma, renal,
lung, prostate and bladder carcinomas [25–27]. PDL1
expression by tumor and/or infiltrating immune cells has
been shown to correlate with a therapeutic response [25,
26, 28–30].
PDL1 expression has been studied in different
cancers [31–42], with evidence of histo-clinical
correlations in several studies. A few studies have been
reported in non-IBC [43–51], but never in IBC. Here, we
have retrospectively analyzed PDL1 mRNA expression
in 112 IBC profiled using DNA microarrays to determine
its prevalence and to search for correlations with histoclinical features, including response to chemotherapy and
survival.

We searched for correlations between PDL1
expression status (high- versus low- groups) and histoclinical variables in IBC samples (Table 2). No correlation
was found with patients’ age, AJCC stage, histological
type and grade, PR and ERBB2 status. By contrast, PDL1
expression correlated with the ER status and the molecular
subtype of samples (Fisher’s exact test). Tumors in the
“PDL1-high” group were more frequently ER-negative
than tumors in the “PDL1-low” group (57% vs 34%, p
= 0.029). The percentages of ERBB2-enriched subtypes
and basal subtypes were higher in the “PDL1-high”
group than “PDL1-low” group (36 vs 19%, and 33 vs
20%, respectively), whereas the percentages of luminal A
subtypes and luminal B subtypes were lower (10 vs 24%,
and 10 vs 26%, respectively).

Correlations of PDL1 expression with immune
parameters
Given the role of PDL1 in immunity, we searched
for correlations (Fisher’s exact test) between PDL1
expression and immunity-related factors in IBC
samples (Table 3). First, we found a correlation with
the lymphocyte infiltrate (both peri-tumoral and intratumoral tumor-infiltrative lymphocytes, TILs), available
for 44 samples and scored in four categories (none, small,
moderate, or strong infiltrate): the percentage of “PDL1high” samples increased with the degree of lymphocyte
infiltrate (p = 0.001). Second, PDL1 expression was
associated with T-cell-specific, CD8+ T-cell-specific
and B-cell-specific gene expression signatures [52]: the
percentage of samples with higher expression of these
signatures was higher in the “PDL1-high” group (p <
0.01). Third, PDL1 expression was associated (p < 0.0001)
with two gene expression signatures (LCK metagene [10]
and 28-kinase metagene [11]) reflecting the immune
response and in particular cytotoxic T-cell response.
Finally, the probability of activation [53] of IFNα, IFNγ,
and TNFα pathways was higher in the “PDL1-high” group
(p < 0.00001; Fisher’s exact test). Altogether, these results
suggested that PDL1 expression in IBC is associated with
anti-tumor T-cell response.

RESULTS
PDL1 expression is higher in IBC than non-IBC
We analyzed PDL1 expression in clinical samples
of 112 IBC and 194 non-IBC collected within the World
IBC Consortium. Their clinical characteristics are shown
in Table 1. IBC patients were younger than non-IBC
patients, and IBC samples showed more often than nonIBC samples poor-prognosis features (p < 0.01; Fisher’s
exact test): AJCC stage 3–4, ductal type, high grade, ERnegative, PR-negative and ERBB2-positive status, and
aggressive molecular subtypes (basal, ERBB2-enriched).
The 5-year metastasis-free survival (MFS) was 49%
(95%CI: 37–64%) in IBC patients and 82% (95%CI:
76–88%) in non-IBC patients (p = 2.7E-9; log-rank test).
Such expected differences confirmed the coherence of our
data set.
PDL1 expression level was heterogeneous across
IBC samples with a range of intensities over 3 decades
in log2 scale (Figure 1A). A similar range of expression
was observed in non-IBC samples, but expression was
higher in IBC than non-IBC samples (p = 0.02, Student’s
t-test; Figure 1B). As compared to normal breast (NB)
samples, 38% of IBC samples (42 out of 112) showed
PDL1 overexpression (ratio T/NB ≥ 2; hereafter defined
as “PDL1-high” group) and 62% (70 out of 112) did not
show overexpression (ratio <2; “PDL1-low” group). For
comparison, 28% of non-IBC samples showed PDL1
overexpression.

Supervised analysis identified 1, 774 genes
differentially expressed between the “PDL1-high”
group (N = 42) and the “PDL1-low” group (N = 70),
including 1, 607 genes overexpressed and 167
genes underexpressed in the “PDL1-high” group

PDL1 expression correlates with pathological
response to chemotherapy in IBC

(C-C or C-X-C motifs) receptors). In addition, several
overexpressed genes were MHC-related molecules,
involved in the processing of endogenous antigens and
presentation to cytotoxic and helper T-cells: HLA-I
or HLA-I-related molecules (e.g. HLA-A/B/C/E/F/G,
butyrophilin family members), but also HLA-II molecules
(e.g. HLA-DM/DO/DP/DQ/DR, CD74), and molecules
involved in the degradation of cytosolic peptides across
the endoplasmic reticulum into the membrane-bound
compartment where class I molecules assemble (e.g.
TAP1, TAPBP, many proteasome subunits). Interestingly,
CTLA4 and LAG3, which code for markers of T-cells
exhaustion, were strongly overexpressed in the “PDL1high” group. HAVCR2 (TIM3), another marker of T-cells
exhaustion, was also upregulated in the “PDL1-high”
group, whereas PD1 or BTLA molecules were not.
PRDM1 (also known as BLIMP1); IDO and TGFβ1,
which code for cytokines synthesized in exhausted
T-cells, were overexpressed in this group as well. Genes
overexpressed in the “PDL1-low” group were involved in
the response to hormone stimuli.

The pathological response to neo-adjuvant
anthracycline-based chemotherapy was documented for
66 out of 112 patients with IBC, of which 22 (33%) had
achieved pCR (pCR group) and 44 (67%) had not (no-pCR
group). Univariate analysis for pCR prediction (logit link
test; Table 4) showed that PDL1 expression was associated
with pCR: the pCR rate was 50% in the “PDL1-high” group
versus 22% in the “PDL1-low” groups (p = 0.03) with an
OR for pCR equal to 3.4 (95%CI 1.04–11.51). By contrast,
patients’ age, histological type and grade, ER, progesterone
receptor (PR) and ERBB2 status, and molecular subtypes
were not, with a trend for better response in PR-negative
versus PR-positive tumors (p = 0.059). Regarding the two
signatures reported as predictive for pathological response
in non-IBC, the FAC/T response signature was associated
with pathological response in our IBC series (p = 0.046) and
the Stromal signature tended to be associated (p = 0.052). In

MFS rate was 49% (95%CI: 37–64%) (Figure 2A). In
univariate analysis, PDL1 expression was not associated
with MFS (p = 0.479, log-rank test; Figure 2B), whereas
ERBB2 status was (p = 0.046) and ER status tended to be
associated with MFS (p = 0.075; Supplementary Table 3).
The results were similar with respect to overall
specific survival (OSS) for the 85 patients, including 49
who remained alive during a median follow-up of 53
months (median OSS: 78 months) and 36 who died from
disease progression. The 5-year OSS was 63% (95%CI:

PR status, and the two signatures), only the PDL1 group
remained significant (p = 0.046), suggesting independent
predictive value (Table 4).

was found in more than one third of samples and
correlated with aggressive molecular subtypes (basal and
ERBB2-enriched) and better pathological response to
chemotherapy.
So far, PDL1 expression in cancers has been
essentially studied at the protein level using IHC. Here, we
based our analysis on mRNA expression measured using
DNA microarrays for several reasons. First, PDL1 IHC
is not yet standardized and many discordant results have
been reported across studies, notably in prognostic studies
[54]. Several antibodies are available but lack specificity

could benefit from innovating therapeutic strategies.

cancers, we aimed at documenting the expression of

and reproducibility [55, 56] and the optimal positivity cutoff is not defined. Second, a positive relationship between
protein and mRNA PDL1 expression has been reported in
non-IBC [46]. Finally, similar results have been reported
in non-IBC at the mRNA level with DNA microarrays and
in situ hybridization (ISH) [46].
We found PDL1 overexpression in 38% of IBC samples.
To date, six teams including ours have described PDL1
expression in non-IBC [43–49, 51], with different analytic
levels (protein, RNA) and different scoring systems, the rate
of expression/overexpression reported ranging between 23
and 55%. In a large series of 5, 454 non-IBC samples, we
found PDL1 overexpression in 20% of cases [50]. Here, with
the same analytic method for IBC and non-IBC samples, we
observed higher expression in IBC than in non-IBC, and the
rate of overexpression was higher in IBC (38% vs 28%).
PDL1 expression was heterogeneous in IBC, with
a 3-log range of expression levels allowing the search
for correlations with other tumor features. “PDL1-high”
IBC samples were more frequently ER-negative and
more frequently ERBB2-enriched and basal than “PDL1low” samples. These correlations persisted when PDL1
expression was analyzed as continuous value (Wilcoxon’s
test; data not shown). Similar correlations have been
reported in non-IBC in clinical samples and cancer cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lines [44, 45, 49–51]. We did not find any correlation with
histological ductal type and high grade, likely because
of the relative small series size and the absence of grade
1 samples, but the percent of grade 3 was higher in the
“PDL1-high” group (82% vs 70%), as observed in non-IBC.
The correlations between immune parameters
and PDL1 expression as binary variable - and as
continuous variable (Wilcoxon’s test; data not shown) and the results of our supervised analysis showed that
the microenvironment of “PDL1-high” IBC samples
is different from that of “PDL1-low” samples and is
suggestive of a strong local cytotoxic immune response.
“PDL1-high” tumors showed a more dense T-cell
infiltration – as already reported by other groups in nonIBC [43, 46, 51] with positive correlation between
PDL1 expression and the presence of elevated TILs-,
higher expression of T-cell-specific and CD8+ T-cellspecific gene expression signatures, and higher expression
of genes coding proteins related to the T-cell receptor.
Furthermore, these tumors showed features of T-cell
activation. Supervised analysis revealed overexpression of
genes coding for T-cells differentiation factors and activation
markers, cytotoxic effector molecules (granzymes, perforin,
granulyzine), inflammation/anti-tumor cytokines such as
interferon, and chemokines related to T-cells activation

and homing. Molecules involved in the processing of
endogenous antigens and presentation to immune cells and
molecules involved in the degradation of cytosolic peptides
were also overexpressed as well as markers of other cells
of anti-tumor immunity (e.g. γδ-T-cells, NKG2D+ cells,
dendritic-cells, B-cells). Finally, PDL1 expression was
associated with two expression signatures (LCK metagene
[10] and 28-kinase metagene [11]) reflecting the T-cell
cytotoxic immune response, and with a high probability of
activation [53] of IFNα, IFNγ, and TNFα pathways. This
pro-cytotoxic expression profile of “PDL1-high” samples
was suggestive of an activated profile of differentiated
T-cells (e.g. EOMES, CD27), TH1-biased (IL12 and IFNinduced pathways), and endowed with cytotoxic effector
functions. However, we also noted that some T-cells
infiltrating the tumor exhibited the phenotype of exhausted
T-cells (CTLA4+/LAG3+/TIM3+/IDO+). T-cells exhaustion
can be measured through the loss of secretion of IL2, IFNγ
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and TNFα, which occurs in a hierarchical manner. IFNγ and
TNFα transcripts were still overexpressed in the “PDL1high” group, suggesting that some activated T-cells might
be progressively shifting toward a complete exhausted
phenotype (still lacking the PD1+ CD160+ 2B4+ markers),
most likely as a protective mechanism from the local
inflammatory environment and the sustained IFNγ-mediated
response. Reverting this exhausted phenotype through
targeting of the surface receptors that inhibit T-cell function,
such as PDL1 or LAG3, might considerably improve the
local immune response and improve the patients’ survival
[57]. We hypothesize that PDL1 expression (like the
exhausted T-cell phenotype) represents a negative feedback
mechanism that follows CD8+ infiltration [41, 58]. In nonIBC, PDL1 mRNA expression is induced in the tumor
microenvironment by activated TILs [43, 46] through the
release of IFNγ [41, 47]. The correlations that we found
between PDL1 expression and the two signatures (LCK
13513

Oncotarget

[10] and 28-kinase [11] metagenes) reflecting the cytotoxic
T-cell response, and the activation [53] of IFNα, IFNγ, and
TNFα pathways corroborate this hypothesis. Similarly,
in a large series of breast cancers, a positive correlation
was found between the expression of immunosuppressive
checkpoint markers (PD-1, PDL1, CTLA4, and FOXP3)
and the expression of proimmune markers, suggestive of a
feedback activation of immunosuppressive pathways as part
of the immune reaction [16]. Interferon gamma and other
inflammatory cytokines, secreted by anti-tumor TH1-cells
or macrophages, increase PDL1 expression, in response
to immune-mediated attack [28], to decrease the cytotoxic
local immune response.
These reactive mechanisms may explain the rather
counterintuitive correlation between the high expression
of PDL1, coding for an immunosuppressive molecule,
and a better pathological response to neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy. Within the 66 informative patients, the pCR
rate was 50% in the “PDL1-high” group versus 22% in
the “PDL1-low” group, with an OR equal to 3.4. Despite
the relative small size of the series, PDL1 expression had
independent predictive value in multivariate analysis,
when compared to other predictive features, including
the classical histo-clinical variables and recent expression
signatures identified in non-IBC. The correlation was
also significant in uni- and multivariate analyses when
PDL1 expression was analyzed as continuous value
(Wilcoxon’s test; data not shown). Similar results were
reported in non-IBC in two series of 265 [50] and 105
[51] samples, respectively. In fact, PDL1 expression
represents a surrogate marker of engaged CD8+ TILs,
which are known to provide favorable predictive value for
response to chemotherapy in non-IBC [59–61] and IBC
[62]. Positive correlation of immunosuppressive markers
with improved therapeutic response has been reported in
other studies as well [9, 16, 63, 64].
Eighty-five stage 3 IBC cases were informative for
MFS and OSS, but PDL1 expression was not associated
with survival. To date, only three breast cancer studies
have studied the prognostic value of PDL1 expression in
non-IBC [46, 49, 50], but results are rather contradictory.
In a series of 398 cases studied by ISH assay PDL1 mRNA
expression was associated with longer recurrence-free
survival [46] but protein expression) was associated with
worse overall survival in a different series of 650 cases
studied by IHC [49]. More recently, we reported the largest
series ever analyzed of non-IBC (1, 080 patients for MFS
and 3, 778 for OS) and showed that PDL1 expression was
not associated with survival in the whole series of samples,
but was associated with better MFS and OS in the basal
subtype. Our results in IBC agree with this recent study.
Unfortunately, we could not apply prognostic analysis per
subtype given the small number of IBC samples.
In conclusion, we show that PDL1 is overexpressed
in IBC as compared to non-IBC and that its
overexpression as compared to normal breast is observed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in 38% of IBC samples. In IBC, PDL1 overexpression
correlates with aggressive molecular subtypes (basal
and ERBB2-enriched) and better pathological response
to chemotherapy. This first report of PDL1 expression
in IBC shows clinical and biological relevance of PDL1
expression in IBC, and independent predictive value for
pathological response to chemotherapy in multivariate
analysis. Its limitations include: retrospective nature
and associated biases such as missing data, size of the
series, absence of information for more patients with
respect to response to chemotherapy and survival, and
use of DNA microarrays that quantify mRNA expression
level of both tumor and immune cells. Analysis of
larger series, retrospective, then prospective is needed,
as well as protein analysis when reliable antibodies are
available. If confirmed, PDL1 expression might refine the
prediction of pathological response in IBC and improve
our ability to better tailor neo-adjuvant therapy. From a
therapeutic point of view, because PDL1 expression in
could indicate an adaptive mechanism of immune escape
[65], the blockade of PDL1 should protect activated
T-cells or reactivate inhibited T-cells and increase the antitumor immune response, thus improving the therapeutic
response, notably when associated with immunogenic
anticancer chemotherapy such as doxorubicin [66, 67].
Given the reported link between PDL1 expression and
tumor response to PDL1-inhibitors [25, 26, 28–30], we
suggest that IBC patients might be candidates to such new
promising therapies. Clinical trials are urgently warranted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Breast cancer samples
Clinical samples were pre-treatment primary
tumor samples from patients with invasive breast
adenocarcinoma treated at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes
(IPC, Marseille: 71 IBC and 139 non-IBC) and the General
Hospital Sint-Augustinus (TCRU, Antwerp: 41 IBC and
55 non-IBC). Each patient gave written informed consent
and the study was approved by our institutional review
boards. IBC was defined according to the international
consensus criteria [1]: rapid onset (less than 6 months) of
breast erythema, edema, and/or “peau d’orange”, and/or
warm breast, with or without an underlying palpable mass.
IBC samples were diagnostic biopsies (AJCC stages 3–4)
from consecutively treated patients, with available histoclinical annotations and good-quality extracted tumor
RNA. Non-IBC samples were surgical specimen in case
of early stage disease (AJCC stages 1–2) and diagnostic
biopsies in case of advanced stage disease (locally
advanced: AJCC stage 3, and metastatic: AJCC stage 4).
The final data set contained 306 samples, including 112
IBC samples and 194 non-IBC samples. We also profiled 4
normal breast samples that represented 1 pool of 4 samples
from 4 healthy women (reduction mammoplasty), and 3
13514

Oncotarget

commercial pools of respectively 1, 2 and 4 normal breast
RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA).
Patients with IBC were treated with neo-adjuvant
anthracycline-based chemotherapy often including taxane,
and coupled with trastuzumab in more than 40% of ERBB2positive cases. Chemotherapy was followed by mastectomy
and axillary lymph node dissection for clinically nonprogressive and consenting patients, then radiotherapy. The
pathological response to chemotherapy was defined on
the surgical specimens of both the primary tumor and the
lymph nodes using Chevallier grading [68]. From the 112
IBC samples, 66 were available for pCR analysis. After
radiotherapy, adjuvant hormone therapy was given to patients
with ER-positive IBC, as well as adjuvant trastuzumab
in ERBB2-positive cases. A total of 85 patients with nonmetastatic IBC were assessable for survival analysis.

institutions, ER, PR, and ERBB2 expressions (negative/
positive) were defined using mRNA expression data
of ESR1, PGR, and ERBB2 respectively as described
[74]. The molecular subtypes of samples were defined
using the PAM50 classifier [73] as previously described
[75]. Because of the role of PDL1 in immunity, we
also analyzed different immune multigene classifiers
that better reflect the functional status of local immune
response than assessment of TILs: the LCK metagene
[10] and the 28-kinase metagene [11] - two prognostic
gene expression signatures published in non-IBC-, three
metagenes representing T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and B-cells
[52], and three gene expression signatures of immune
pathway activity: IFNα, IFNγ, and TNFα pathways [53].
Two gene expression signatures predictive for pathological
response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in non-IBC were
also applied: the FAC/T response signature [76] and the
stromal signature [77].
Finally, to explore the biological pathways
associated with PDL1 expression in IBC, we applied
supervised analysis to the 112 samples and the 14, 338
genes remaining after filtering (removal of probes
with low and poorly measured expression and standard
deviation inferior to 0.25 log2 units) for comparing the
gene expression profiles between the “PDL1-high”
versus “PDL1-low” tumors. We used Significant Analysis
of Microarrays (SAM) [78] algorithm and considered
p-values, corrected for multiple comparisons (false
discovery rate; FDR), as significant when smaller than
0.05. Ontology analysis of the resulting gene list was
based on the GO biological processes of the Database
for Annotation, Visualisation and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID; http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).

Gene expression data analysis
Gene expression profiles had been generated in
each institution using the same Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0
human microarrays (Affymetrix®, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
as previously described [69]. All data were MIAMEcompliant and deposited in the Array-Express database
(E-MTAB-1547 and E-MTAB-1006). Data analysis
required pre-analytic processing. We first normalized each
data set separately using Robust Multichip Average (RMA)
[70]. Normalization was done in R using Bioconductor and
associated packages. The gene annotation of hybridization
probes was updated using NetAffx Annotation files (http://
www.affymetrix.com; release from 01/12/2008). The
probes were then mapped based on their EntrezGeneID.
When multiple probes mapped to the same GeneID, we
retained the one with the highest variance in a particular
dataset. We then merged the two data sets by using
COMBAT (empirical Bayes) [71] as batch effects removal
method, included in the inSilicoMerging R/Bioconductor
package [72]. The accuracy of normalization was
controlled by principal component analysis (PCA) applied
to the 306 tumors and the genes of PAM50 signature [73]
(Supplementary Figure 1).
PDL1 (CD274) expression was measured by
analyzing the 227458_at Affymetrix probe set whose
identity and specificity were verified using the NCBI
program BLASTN 2.2.29+ and showed 100% accuracy.
Expression in tumors (T) was measured as discrete value
after comparison with mean expression in normal breast
samples (NB): overexpression, thereafter designated
“PDL1-high” was defined by a T/NB ratio ≥ 2 and no
overexpression (“PDL1-low”) by a T/NB ratio <2. The
cut-off, equal to 2, was arbitrarily chosen, but is frequently
used with DNA microarray or qRT-PCR data, based on
reproducibility experiments. Correlation analyses were
also done with PDL1 expression in continuous values.
Thanks to the bimodal distribution of their respective
mRNA expression and to avoid biases associated to
immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses across our two
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
Correlations between PDL1 expression and histoclinical factors were calculated with the Student’s t-test
for expression assessed as continuous variable and the
Fisher’s exact test for expression assessed as binary
variable (PDL1-high and PDL1-low). The pathological
complete response (pCR) to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
was defined as the absence of invasive cancer in both
breast and axillary lymph nodes (Chevallier grades 1 and
2), whereas Chevallier grades 3 and 4 were considered as
no-pCR. MFS was calculated from the date of diagnosis
until the date of first distant relapse. OSS was calculated
from the date of diagnosis until the date of IBC-related
death. Follow-up was measured from the date of diagnosis
to the date of last news for event-free patients. Survivals
were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and
curves were compared with the log-rank test. Univariate
and multivariate survival analyses were done using a
logistic regression analysis for pCR analysis (glm function
and significance estimated by specifying a binomial family
for model with a logit link) and Cox regression analysis for
survival analysis (Wald test). Variables tested in univariate
13515

analyses included patients’ age at time of diagnosis (≤50
years vs > 50), histological type (ductal vs other) and
grade (3 vs 2; no grade 1 in our IBC series), ER, PR and
ERBB2 status (positive vs negative), molecular subtypes,
and PDL1 expression status (“PDL1-high” vs “PDL1low”). Variables with a p-value < 0.10 in univariate
analysis were tested in multivariate analysis. All statistical
tests were two-sided at the 5% level of significance.
Statistical analysis was done using the survival package
(version 2.30) in the R software (version 2.9.1; http://
www.cran.r-project.org/). We followed the reporting
