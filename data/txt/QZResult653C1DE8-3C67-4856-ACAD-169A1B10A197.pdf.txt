BACKGROUND: Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a highly curable disease; however, prognostic factors for the
survival of patients who develop recurrent disease have not been clearly defined. METHODS: This was a retrospective
analysis of 50 pediatric patients with HL who relapsed or progressed between 1990 and 2006 and who were
retrieved with intense cytoreductive treatment regimens followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and radiation therapy. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine risk factors for second treatment failure and
death. RESULTS: The median patient age was 16.1 years (range, 4.9-22.1 years) at the time of HL diagnosis. Fifteen
patients developed progressive disease during therapy, 14 patients relapsed early, and 21 patients relapsed late.
Patients who remained alive at the time of this study had been followed for a median of 4.4 years (range, 1.2-16.6
years). The 5-year overall survival rate for patients who had an inadequate response (n ¼ 14) to initial salvage therapy
was only 17.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1%-42.5%) compared with 97.2% (95% CI, 81.9%-99.6%) for patients
who responded (n ¼ 36; P < .0001). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis of overall survival, an inadequate
response to initial salvage therapy was the only significant variable (hazard ratio, 43.6; 95% CI, 5.4-354; P ¼.0004).
CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that pediatric patients with relapsed HL who have an inadequate
response after initial primary salvage chemotherapy have a very poor prognosis and should be considered for novel

KEYWORDS: Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment failure, pediatric, salvage therapy.

Children and adolescents with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) achieve 5-year event-free survival rates of approximately
85% with modern combined-modality therapy.1 Even those who fail frontline therapy have a 10-year overall survival
(OS) rate as high as 75%.2 Given the small number of patients that fail primary therapy, no uniform salvage strategy has
been developed for this patient population. Most salvage regimens contain new drug combinations that are not included
in frontline therapy, additional radiation therapy, and high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation
(SCT).2,3 Several groups have tried to identify prognostic factors predictive of frontline treatment failure in children and
adults.4,5 In adults, a prognostic score for patients with relapsed HL has been developed in which a shorter time to treatment failure (<12 months after the end of primary therapy), a higher clinical stage at treatment failure (stages III and IV),
and anemia at the time of treatment failure predict a poor outcome.6 In children and adolescents, only progressive disease
during frontline therapy, as opposed to relapse >1 year after the completion of therapy, has been identified as prognostic
for a low rate of second event-free survival.2 The objective of the current study was to identify factors that predicted outcome in pediatric patients with HL who progressed or relapsed after initial treatment with a combined-modality therapy
regimen that included both chemotherapy and radiation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between January 1990 and December of 2006, 342
patients with newly diagnosed HL were treated at St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital with risk-stratified,
response-adapted chemotherapy plus involved-field
radiation. Six of the 56 patients who had failed frontline
therapy were excluded from the study for the following
reasons: One patient who had a late relapsed refused any
further therapy and died of disease, and 5 patients
received their salvage therapy elsewhere.
Frontline Therapy
The chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimens that
were used between 1990 and 2001 have been described
elsewhere7-9 and are summarized in Table 1. Patients with
high-risk HL who were diagnosed after 2001 and those
with intermediate-risk HL who were diagnosed after mid2004 received 12 weeks of weekly multiagent (vinblastine,

nitrogen mustard, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine,
bleomycin, and prednisone), dose-intensive chemotherapy (the ‘‘Stanford V’’ regimen) followed by responsebased, low-dose, involved-field radiation.10 Five patients
received a combination of vinblastine, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and prednisone (VEPA) and cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, and procarbazine (COP) (see Table 1, footnote), and none of those patients relapsed. All patients
were staged according to the Ann Arbor staging classification11 with computed tomography (CT) scans, positron
emission tomography (PET) or gallium scans, and bone
marrow biopsies when indicated. All patients were
restaged to evaluate early response as indicated by their
protocol and no later than 2 weeks after they finished
chemotherapy in preparation for their radiation therapy.
No patient was delayed for >4 weeks between the completion of chemotherapy and the initiation of
radiotherapy.

Follow-Up and Treatment Failure
After frontline therapy, patients were evaluated every 3
months for the first year, every 4 months for the next 2
years, every 6 months for the next 2 years, and yearly
thereafter. Evaluations consisted of laboratory studies,
chest x-rays, and physical examinations at every visit and
CT scans with functional imaging (gallium or PET scans,
depending on the era of treatment) at the first and second
yearly follow-up visits and at the discretion of the treating
physician if symptoms developed between screening visits.
When treatment failure was suspected, patients were evaluated with CT scans and functional imaging studies as
well as bilateral bone marrow biopsies. Treatment failure
was confirmed histologically in all patients.
Salvage Therapy
Salvage regimens were chosen by the treating physician
according to previous treatment intensity, timing of treatment failure, patient status, and physician preference. In
the earlier era, patients were more likely to be retrieved
with a nitrogen mustard (cyclophosphamide), vincristine,
procarbazine, and prednisone (M[C]OPP)/doxorubicin,
bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) regimen
or with an M(C)OPP/ABVD-derived regimen (n ¼ 11).
In recent years, patients more often were retrieved with
high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, and dexamethasone (MIED) or with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and
etoposide (ICE) (n ¼ 26); in some cases of localized late
treatment failure, patients received Stanford V chemotherapy (n ¼ 11). One patient received VEPA as an initial
salvage regimen, and 1 patient received gemcitabine/
vinorelbine (G/V). Salvage therapy included high-dose
chemotherapy with SCT in all high-risk patients who
responded to first or subsequent salvage chemotherapy.
Autologous transplantation conditioning regimens varied
during the 17-year study period: 5 patients received carboplatin/etoposide, 3 patients received cyclophosphamide/busulfan, 2 patients received cyclophosphamide/
topotecan, 2 patients received busulfan/melphalan, 1
patient received MOPP, and 18 patients received combined carmustine, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, and
melphalan. After SCT, radiation therapy was administered to lymph node sites that were affected at the time of
treatment failure.
Response Assessment
Adequate responses to initial salvage therapy included
complete responses (CR) (ie, a reduction 75% reduc-

4378

tion in the original tumor on a CT scan [using the product
of the 2 greatest tumor dimensions to determine size] and
negative gallium or PET scans) or partial responses (PR)
(a 50%-74% reduction in tumor size in a CT scans,
regardless of PET avidity). An inadequate response was
defined as anything that did not meet these criteria. No
patient who attained a CR had a positive PET scan.

Statistical Methods
Treatment failure was defined as progressive disease or
any form of relapse, and patients were classified with progressive disease if new lesions developed or if an existing
lesion increased in size by >25%, or if treatment failure
occurred within 3 months of the end of therapy. Early
relapse was defined as treatment failure from 3 to 12
months after the completion of therapy, and late relapse
was defined as any failure that occurred thereafter. These
definitions were chosen in accordance with previous studies of patients with relapsed/progressive Hodgkin lymphoma.2 Cutoff values that were used to categorize white
blood cell count (13.5  109/L vs >13.5  109/L), hemoglobin (<10.5 g/dL for girls and <12.0 g/dL for boys
vs greater than or equal to those levels), and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (<50 mm per hour vs 50 mm per
hour) also were based on values that were identified as predictive of outcome in previous studies.5,6 A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify risk factors for
second treatment failure and death.12 For the multivariate
Cox regression analysis, only variables that were identified
as significant (P < .05) in the univariate Cox regression
analysis were considered. Freedom from second treatment
failure was calculated from the date of first treatment failure to the date of an event (second treatment failure, disease progression, or death, whichever occurred earliest),
and patients who did not have an event were censored at
the last follow-up date. OS was calculated from the date
of first treatment failure to the date of death from any
cause. Living patients were censored at the last follow-up
date. Freedom from second treatment failure and OS
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.13 Logrank tests were used to compare freedom from second
treatment failure and OS distributions according to demographic and treatment characteristics. All analyses were
performed in SAS software (version 9.1l SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC). After receiving institutional review board
approval, we reviewed medical records for demographic
information, details of therapy, and disease and survival
outcomes.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics at Diagnosis of
Treatment Failure
Patient characteristics at diagnosis and second treatment
failure are described in Table 2. The median age for the
50 patients (30 males and 20 females) was 16.1 years
(range, 4.9-22.1 years) at the diagnosis of HL and 17.5
years (range, 7.1-24.6 years) at the time of first treatment
failure. Seventy-two percent of patients (n ¼ 36) were
white, and 28% (n ¼ 14) were black. Seventeen patients
(34%) had localized disease (stage IA or IIA), and 33
patients (66%) had advanced disease (stage IIB, IIIA,

IIIB, or IV) at initial diagnosis. B symptoms (drenching
night sweats, unexplained fevers, or weight loss >10%)
were present in 44% of patients at initial diagnosis. Forty
patients (80%) had nodular sclerosing histology, and 19
patients (38%) had extranodal disease (lung, liver, bone,
or bone marrow) at the time of treatment failure. Fifteen
patients (30%) progressed during frontline therapy, 14
patients (28%) relapsed early (3-12 months after the completion of initial therapy), and 21 patients (42%) relapsed
late (>12 months after the completion of therapy). First
treatment failures occurred after a median of 14.6 months
(range, 1.1-121 months). Forty-nine of 50 patients (98%)
had follow-up within the last year.
Response to Frontline and Salvage Regimens
Table 3 summarizes disease response and ultimate outcomes for specific patients according to frontline therapy,
failure type (primary progressive, early relapse, or late
relapse), salvage therapy, and use of SCT. Response rates to
salvage regimens (MIED, 76%; Stanford V, 91%; MOPP
and derivatives, 55%; and ICE, G/V, and VEPA, 33%)
varied and potentially were biased by patient characteristics
(timing and bulk of recurrence as well as intensity of frontline therapy), so response rates could not be compared. Of
the 15 patients who had primary progressive disease, 7
patients (54%) did not have an adequate response to primary salvage therapy; all received additional cycles of
intense chemotherapy, but 5 patients never demonstrated
sensitivity to any salvage chemotherapy and died of their
disease. Two patients eventually responded to salvage therapy and underwent consolidation therapy with autologous
SCT and radiation therapy. One of those patients died of
disease, and the other patient has remained disease-free 4
years after his initial treatment failure.
Three of 14 patients who relapsed early (21%) did
not have an adequate response to primary therapy; 1 of
those patients refused further therapy and died of disease,
whereas the other 2 patients received intense second-line
salvage therapy with autologous SCT, after which 1
patient died of disease and the other remained alive and in
remission for 2 years. Four of 21 patients (19%) who
relapsed late did not have an adequate response to initial
salvage therapy: Only 1 of those patients remained alive
and disease free >5 years after he had further intensive
chemotherapy, autologous SCT, and radiation therapy.
Of the other 3 patients who died—all from disease or
treatment-related complications—2 patients died after
undergoing autologous SCT despite an inadequate
response to initial therapy.

Numbers in parentheses indicate the numbers of patients in each category.

Of the 36 patients who had an adequate initial
response to their primary salvage regimen, only 2 patients
died of disease after subsequent treatment failure, and 1
patient has remained alive with disease for the past 10
years with short-lasting responses to various therapies.
Four other patients who had an initial adequate response

retrieved with a third-line regimen and remain diseasefree.
Freedom From Second Treatment Failure
and Survival
For all patients, the 5-year rate of freedom from second
treatment failure was 57.8% (95% confidence interval

[CI], 42.1%-70.6%), and the 5-year OS rate was 74.2%
(95% CI, 58.7%-84.6%) (Fig. 1). The 5-year OS rate was
significantly lower for patients who had primary progressive disease (53.3%; 95% CI, 26.3%-74.3%) than for
patients who relapsed early or late (83.2%; 95% CI,
63.6%-92.8%; P ¼ .01) (Fig. 2, top). When analyzing
OS according to adequacy of response to primary salvage
therapy, patients who did not respond to their primary
salvage therapy had a 5-year OS rate of only 17.9% (95%
CI, 3.1%-42.5%) compared with 97.2% (95% CI,
81.9%-99.6%) for patients who did respond (P < .0001)
(Fig. 2, bottom). Patients who remained alive have been
followed for a median 4.9 years (range, 1.5-18.1 years),

Several prognostic factors were analyzed for their potential
impact on second treatment failure. Neither white blood

extranodal treatment failure was associated significantly
with second treatment failure. The only significant prog-

Cancer

September 15, 2010

nostic factors for second treatment failure in univariate
analysis were initial progressive disease (hazard ratio
[HR], 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.1; P ¼ .02), anemia (hemoglobin <10.5 g/dL for girls and <12 g/dL for boys vs greater
than or equal to those levels) at treatment failure (HR,
2.6; 95% CI, 1.0-6.5; P ¼ .04), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (<50 mm per hour vs 50 mm per hour) at
treatment failure (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.0-6.8; P ¼ .04),
and inadequate response to initial salvage therapy (HR,
65.4; 95% CI, 13.7-311; P < .0001). In a multivariate
Cox regression analysis that was controlled for the type of
first treatment failure (progressive disease, early, late), the
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and anemia, only an inadequate response to initial salvage therapy was significant
(HR, 73; 95% CI, 14-381; P < .0001).
The same prognostic factors were analyzed for their
potential association with death (Table 4). Factors that
were associated significantly with death in univariate analysis were an erythrocyte sedimentation rate 50 mm per
hour (HR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2-11; P ¼ .02), initial progressive disease (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.1-17; P ¼ .04), and an

The 5-year overall survival rate for patients who had primary
progressive disease was 53.3% (95% confidence interval [CI],
26.3%-74.3%) versus patients who relapsed early or late
(83.2%; 95% CI, 63.6%-92.8%). (Bottom) Overall survival is for

their prescribed radiotherapy were not at greater risk of
death compared with patients who progressed after receiving their prescribed frontline radiotherapy (3 of 8 patients
whose disease progressed before frontline radiation therapy died vs 4 of 7 patients whose disease progressed after
radiation therapy; P ¼ .38).

DISCUSSION
The strongest predictor of survival in our study was
whether patients had an adequate response to their first 2
cycles of intense salvage chemotherapy (termed ‘‘chemosensitivity’’). However, the role of chemosensitivity as a
predictor of outcome has been controversial. Earlier studies in adults suggested that chemosensitivity before autologous SCT does not predict progression-free
survival,14,15 whereas more recent studies evaluating prognostic factors and treatment outcome in adult patients

4382

with primary progressive HL clearly demonstrate that sensitivity to conventional salvage chemotherapy regimens
predicts survival.16-20 Comparison of these studies, however, is not straightforward, because the study by Chopra
et al.14 evaluated a cohort of adult patients who underwent autologous SCT despite the absence of chemosensitive disease; whereas most patients who had
chemoresistant disease in the study by Josting et al.21 either died rapidly from their disease or were deemed ineligible for autologous SCT. In a cohort of pediatric patients
with HL who had recurrent or progressive disease and
underwent autologous SCT, the factors associated with a
poor outcome were extranodal disease at the time of treatment failure, mediastinal mass at the time of transplantation, and progression during frontline therapy (risk ratio,
6.4; 95% CI 1.6-25.3; P ¼ .008).22,23 Extranodal disease
in our study was not associated with a poorer prognosis.
In another retrospective study of 51 pediatric patients
with relapsed or refractory HL, autologous SCT was no
better than conventional salvage therapy in patients with
relapsed disease but was beneficial for patients with primary refractory HL.24
In our cohort, of the 14 patients who had an inadequate response to primary salvage therapy, 10 patients
died of progressive disease (despite additional aggressive
salvage chemotherapy and SCT in 4 patients), and 3
patients remained alive and disease free (2.5 years, 3.5
years, and 6 years after initial treatment failure) after additional cycles of a different salvage therapy regimen followed by autologous SCT. Among the 36 patients who
had an adequate response to first salvage therapy, 11
patients (31%) did not undergo autologous SCT, and all
of them remain alive and disease free, casting doubt on
the supposition that all patients who fail frontline therapy
require SCT, particularly if their response to initial salvage
therapy is adequate. A randomized trial of SCT versus
consolidation radiation therapy or additional chemotherapy will be required to determine whether SCT improves
outcomes for specific patient groups.
Our current results also confirm that primary progressive disease indicates a poor prognosis for pediatric
patients with HL. This finding is in agreement with previous studies in pediatric and adult patients with relapsed
HL indicating the prognostic significance of the length of
time between primary diagnosis and treatment failure.2,6,21,25 In the current study, we also attempted to validate the prognostic score developed by the German
Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group for adults6 in our pediatric HL population (data not shown). However, in our

study, stage at the time of treatment failure did not predict
survival, and hemoglobin concentration was significant
for second treatment failure but not for OS and, thus, was
not used in our multivariate Cox regression analysis. A salvage therapy study by the German Pediatric Hodgkin
Lymphoma Study Group demonstrated that the length of
time from diagnosis to first treatment failure was the
strongest prognostic factor.2 Multivariate analysis in that
study indicated that primary chemotherapy without procarbazine and etoposide predicted a higher disease-free
survival, and male sex was associated with higher OS. Neither study analyzed the association between response after
2 cycles of intense salvage chemotherapy and patient
outcome.
The role of reducing disease bulk in HL before
transplantation also remains controversial.14,18,26-29 The
most commonly used method of assessment for residual
disease has been CT, which does not provide information
regarding the presence of persistent active disease within
residual lymph node masses and is especially problematic
in the interpretation of residual fibrosis in HL, which is
slow to resolve and confounds response assessment. More
recent studies have evaluated the role of PET for staging,
restaging, and assessing tumor chemosensitivity.30-37
Future prospective studies are needed to fully assess the
role of PET in predicting outcome and guiding salvage
therapy in patients with pediatric HL who fail frontline
therapy.
Our current study was limited because patients had
failed after several different frontline therapy regimens
and were treated by different physicians over a 17-year period. The choice of salvage regimen changed over time
and depended on the intensity of the frontline therapy as
well as timing of the relapse, and the use of SCT was left
to the discretion of the primary physician without preexisting guidelines. However, the choice of salvage regimen did not influence the rate of adequate response (70%
with MIED and 70% with all other regimens), and the
practice of all clinicians during this time was similar:
Patients who ultimately achieved a response were referred
for autologous SCT unless they had late, localized relapses
with an adequate response to initial salvage therapy. In
this study, we have documented the important new finding that an inadequate response to initial salvage therapy
in pediatric patients with HL is correlated with a very
unfavorable ultimate outcome.
In conclusion, our results suggest that pediatric
patients with HL who do not respond to initial salvage
should not receive a series of alternative cytoreduction reg-

imens in the hope of finding a regimen to which the disease is sensitive; rather, such patients should be referred
early for experimental therapies directed at biologic or
immunologic targets. Thus, pediatric patients with
relapsed HL who have an inadequate response after initial
primary salvage chemotherapy have a very poor prognosis
and should be considered for such novel therapies.
