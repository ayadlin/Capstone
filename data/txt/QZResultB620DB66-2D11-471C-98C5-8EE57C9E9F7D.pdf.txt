Abstract

Author Manuscript

Progesterone and estrogen are important drivers of breast cancer proliferation. Herein, we probed
ER-alpha and PR cross-talk in breast cancer models. Stable expression of PR-B in PR-low/ER+
MCF7 cells increased cellular sensitivity to estradiol and IGF1, as measured in growth assays
performed in the absence of exogenous progestin; similar results were obtained in PR-null/ER+
T47D cells stably expressing PR-B. Genome-wide microarray analyses revealed that unliganded
PR-B induced robust expression of a subset of estradiol-responsive ER-target genes, including
CathepsinD (CTSD). Estradiol-treated MCF7 cells stably expressing PR-B exhibited enhanced ER
Ser167 phosphorylation and recruitment of ER, PR, and the proline, glutamate and leucine rich
protein 1 (PELP1) to an estrogen response element (ERE) in the CTSD distal promoter; this
complex co-immunoprecipitated with IGF1R in whole cell lysates. Importantly, ER/PR/PELP1
complexes were also detected in human breast cancer samples. Inhibition of IGF1R or PI3K
blocked PR-B-dependent CTSD mRNA upregulation in response to estradiol. Similarly, inhibition
of IGF1R or PR significantly reduced ER recruitment to the CTSD promoter. Stable knockdown of
endogenous PR or onapristone treatment of multiple unmodified breast cancer cell lines blocked
estradiol-mediated CTSD induction, inhibited growth in soft agar, and partially restored

tamoxifen-sensitivity of resistant cells. Further, combination treatment of breast cancer cells with
both onapristone and IGF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor AEW541 was more effective than either
agent alone. In summary, unliganded PR-B enhanced proliferative responses to estradiol and IGF1
via scaffolding of ERalpha/PELP1/IGF1R-containing complexes. Our data provide a strong
rationale for targeting PR in combination with ER and IGF1R in patients with luminal breast
cancer.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Approximately 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are luminal breast cancers that are
positive for estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression (1).
Although ER-targeted therapies are relatively successful in treating ER+ tumors, primary
endocrine resistance occurs in up to a third of all breast cancers (2). Mechanisms of
resistance to ER-targeted therapies are widely studied and include upregulation of growth
factor pathways and increased ER cytoplasmic signaling, in addition to altered ER target
gene profiles, enhanced ER phosphorylation, and deregulation of ER pathway components
(3, 4). For example, the proline, glutamate and leucine rich protein 1 (PELP1), a growth
factor receptor adaptor molecule and ER coactivator, is frequently upregulated in endocrineresistant tumors (5). Endocrine-resistant tumors are characterized by increased
aggressiveness and metastatic potential. Patients with recurrent endocrine-resistant tumors
are generally treated with systemic chemotherapy.

PR expression in breast cancer predicts response to ER-targeted therapies, in part because
ER regulates PR expression (3). Additionally, both ER and PR share similar signaling
pathways (6) and exhibit substantial overlap in their transcriptomes (7). Recent mechanistic
studies by our group and others have shown that PR is capable of driving breast cancer
progression in both the absence and presence of progestin (8). Ligand-independent PR
actions include scaffolding of growth factor pathways to enhance kinase signaling (9) and
activation of pro-growth and pro-survival transcriptional programs in breast cancer cells
(10–12). In vitro models of aromatase inhibitor-resistant breast cancer cells demonstrated
sensitivity to the PR antagonist, CDB-2914, which inhibited cell cycle progression (13).
Recently, ER has been shown to cooperate with PR in response to progestins (14).
Additional evidence demonstrated that cells in the normal adult mammary gland (15) and in
breast tumors (16) contain cell populations that express ER only, PR only, both receptors, or
neither. A small population of SR+ (steroid receptor) cells in the normal mammary gland
have been shown to secrete paracrine factors and thereby provide potent proliferative signals
to adjacent SR− cells (17). Indeed, estradiol (E2) has been shown to drive the proliferative
actions of PR-B, an ER target gene that is required for mammary gland alveologenesis (17).
In addition, PR-B has been shown to induce breast cancer cell growth in soft agar assays,
whereas PR-A does not (18). These data provide a strong rationale for the study of ER
actions independently of PR and in conjunction with PR to better understand how these SRs

cooperate to modulate hormone responsiveness in normal and breast cancer tissues. Herein,
we hypothesized that PR-B+/ER+ breast cancer cells have a heightened sensitivity to
estrogen because of direct molecular cross-talk between ER and PR-B. This heightened
sensitivity represents a potential mechanism by which resistance to endocrine therapy can
develop.

PR-B enhances breast cancer cell proliferation in response to estradiol and IGF1

Author Manuscript

To address the question of whether ER and PR-B, the mitogenic PR isoform in the breast,
work in concert to enhance estradiol sensitivity in breast cancer cells, we utilized the
traditionally SR+ breast cancer cell model, MCF7. Beginning with a naturally occurring ER
+/PR-low variant of MCF7 cells (19), we stably re-expressed either PR-B (pSG5-PR-B) or a
vector (pSG5) control (Fig 1A). Cells expressing PR-B or vector-matched controls were
then subjected to MTT proliferation assays and grown in soft agar. Notably, MCF7 cells
lacking PR-B but containing abundant ER-alpha were not significantly responsive to
estradiol as measured by MTT assays; however, MCF7 cells expressing PR-B displayed
significantly heightened proliferation in response to estradiol (Fig S1A). PR-B-null MCF7
cells (empty vector) displayed a slight increase in colony formation in response to estradiol.
MCF7 cells stably expressing PR-B displayed increased anchorage independent growth in
response to estradiol relative to PR-null controls (Fig 1BC). Similar results were observed in
ER+/PR-null T47D cells stably expressing PR-B relative to vector controls (Fig S1 and Fig
1C); interestingly, these cells were also more responsive to IGF1 treatment, a growth factor
receptor pathway known to extensively crosstalk with ER signaling (20). In addition, we
examined the estradiol-induced growth of unmodified MCF7L and BT474 breast cancer cell
lines after treatment with the type II anti-PR drug onapristone. MCF7L cells are ER+/PR+
and express abundant levels of PR-A and PR-B (Fig 1E). BT474 cells are ER+/PR+/HER2+
and are considered relatively aggressive but still highly responsive to estradiol. Onapristone
partially blocked (41%) estradiol-induced soft agar growth of MCF7L cells (Fig 1D) and
dramatically inhibited (63%) estradiol-driven soft agar growth of BT474 cells (Fig 1E).
Notably, onapristone treatment did not alter ER expression levels in either cell line (Fig 1F).

Author Manuscript

To complement these studies, we performed gene-silencing experiments in MCF7L cells
that express abundant levels of PR-A and PR-B. ER+/PR+ MCF7L cells were stably
transfected with shRNAs targeting GFP (control; shGFP) or PRs (shPR). Total PR mRNA
(qRT-PCR) and PR protein (WB) levels were assessed to confirm PR knockdown in
multiple clones (Fig S2A and not shown). ER expression remained relatively unchanged
upon PR knockdown (Fig S2A). Soft agar assays demonstrated that cells expressing control
shRNA exhibited basal colony formation that was significantly enhanced by estradiol
treatment. In contrast, estradiol-induced soft agar colony formation was significantly blunted
by shPR (Fig S2B) and partially blocked by onapristone (Fig 1D). Together, our data
demonstrate a novel ligand-independent PR function in ER+ breast cancer cells, in which
PR-B confers heightened responsiveness to estradiol and IGF1.

Estradiol-treated PR-B+/ER+ breast cancer cells express a distinct gene signature
associated with tumor progression

Author Manuscript

To determine whether unliganded PR-B participates in ER-dependent transcriptional
responses, we performed gene array analyses to measure changes in the ER transcriptome.
Serum-starved MCF7 cells stably expressing either vector or PR-B were treated with
estradiol (6h), and mRNA was harvested for gene expression analyses. Unsupervised
clustering of differentially regulated genes was visualized by heat map. As predicted (10,
12), PR-B expression alone profoundly altered hormone-independent (basal) gene
expression (Fig 2A; lanes 1 and 3). Estradiol-stimulated gene expression profiles revealed
40 genes that were upregulated (>2 fold, P <0.001) and 49 genes that were downregulated
(<2 fold, P <0.001) (Fig 2A, lanes 2 and 4) in PR-B-expressing cells compared to PR-null
vector-matched controls (Table S1). IPA analysis revealed that the biological processes
significantly associated with this PR-B-dependent, estradiol-induced gene signature included
cancer, cell cycle, reproductive system disease, cellular movement, cell growth and
proliferation, and cell death and survival (Fig S3A). Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) showed that estradiol-induced genes in PR-B+ MCF7 cells were
significantly (FDR<0.05) associated with genes upregulated in the luminal-B subtype of
breast cancer (21) (Fig S3B), two independent tamoxifen-resistant signatures (22, 23), and
ESR1-positive breast tumors relative to ESR1-negative tumors (24). Notably, luminal-B
breast cancers are more likely to become endocrine resistant (25). These data indicate that
PR-B and ER cooperate in the regulation of estradiol-induced gene expression programs
associated with breast tumor progression.

Author Manuscript

Known ER-target genes among the 40 genes upregulated in PR-B+/ER+ MCF7 cells relative
to PR-null/ER+ vector-matched controls were examined by qRT-PCR. PR-B expression
significantly enhanced estradiol responsiveness to SLC7A5 (Fig 2B, upper panel), a gene
known to be regulated by ER and IGF-1(26). Notably, a query of TCGA (The Cancer
Genome Atlas) breast cancer data (27) found that SLC7A5 mRNA was expressed at higher
levels in invasive breast carcinoma than in normal mammary tissue (Fig 2B), lower panel).
In addition, PR-B expression significantly increased estradiol sensitivity to induced ERtarget genes WISP2 and PTGES, (Fig 2C). Similar to PR-dependent but estradiol-induced
genes, numerous genes were also downregulated by estradiol in PR-B-expressing cells
relative to PR-null (vector) cells, including maoa (Fig 2D, upper panel), lxn, and tmprss2
(Fig 2E); maoa expression is significantly downregulated in invasive breast carcinoma
compared to normal breast tissue, as determined by analysis of TCGA (Fig 2D, lower
panel).

Author Manuscript

Notably, PR-B expression exclusively enhanced estradiol sensitivity for the classical ERtarget gene cathepsin-D (CTSD) (Fig 3A). Estradiol-induced CTSD expression in PR-B+
MCF7 cells was not significantly affected by the addition of progestin or IGF1 (Fig S4A–B).
The expression of TFF1 (pS2), another well-characterized ER-target gene, was not affected
by PR-B expression (Fig 3A). As expected, expression of SGK, a classical PR target gene,
was increased in PR-B+ MCF7 cells treated with the synthetic progestin, R5020 (Fig 3A).
Analysis of the TCGA breast cancer data set revealed that CTSD expression was also
significantly higher in invasive breast cancers than in normal tissues (Fig 3B). Interestingly,

analysis of PR and CTSD mRNA expression demonstrated a tendency toward co-occurrence
in invasive breast carcinoma in the TCGA data set, whereas PR and TFF1 expression were
not associated. These data demonstrate that PR-B cooperates with ER to drive the
expression of a subset of ER-target genes.

Author Manuscript

PR-A and PR-B isoforms are co-expressed in normal and neoplastic cells; however, the ratio
of PR-A to PR-B frequently varies amongst breast tumors (28). To determine whether PR-A
also cooperates with ER to drive CTSD expression, we utilized previously characterized PRnull T47D cells stably expressing either PR-A or PR-B ((11) and Fig S5A). Similar to our
results in MCF7 cells, PR-null/ER+ T47D cells did not induce CTSD expression in response
to estradiol, whereas PR-B+/ER+ T47D cells did induce CTSD expression (Fig 4A). In
contrast to PR-B expressing cells, PR-A+/ER+ T47D cells failed to increase the expression
of CTSD in response to estradiol (Fig S5B). These data suggest that PR-B is the primary
mediator of cross-talk with ER in the upregulation of CTSD.
PR DNA-binding domain is essential for CTSD expression

Author Manuscript

CTSD is widely used as a measure of estradiol responsiveness in breast cancer models (29).
We therefore focused on the regulation of this gene as a model for probing mechanistic
interactions between ER and PR-B. To test the requirement for the PR DNA-binding domain
in estradiol-induced CTSD regulation, we again utilized PR-null T47D cells engineered to
stably express either wild type (wt) PR-B or a DNA-binding domain mutant of PR-B (DBM
PR-B) (18). Importantly, ER protein levels in T47D cells stably expressing either wt or
DBM PR-B cells were comparable; however, PR-B protein levels were higher in T47D cells
expressing DBM PR-B (Fig 4B, inset), perhaps due to deficient turnover of this mutant
protein. T47D cells expressing DBM PR-B failed to appreciably induce CTSD upon
estradiol stimulation relative to the significant response observed in T47D cells expressing
wt PR-B (Fig 4B). The classical ER-target gene, TFF1, was significantly upregulated in
both cell lines upon estradiol treatment (not shown). These data show that the PR DNAbinding domain is required for ER/PR-B co-regulation of CTSD expression.
PR-B and ER are recruited to the CTSD promoter in response to estradiol

Author Manuscript

ER binds to both proximal (30) and distal (29) sites in the CTSD promoter in response to
estradiol. We focused on the distal ER-binding site as the primary site for estradiol-mediated
CTSD upregulation (29). ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays were performed on
MCF7 cells expressing PR-B or vector-matched controls. Cells were treated (1hr) with
vehicle or estradiol prior to assessment of ER recruitment to the CTSD distal promoter.
Interestingly, ER binding to the distal region of the CTSD promoter was negligible in PRnull, vector-matched control cells, whereas it was robust in PR-B expressing cells treated
with estradiol (Fig 4C). Previously published estradiol responsive elements (EREs) in the
promoter region of a control gene (TFF1) were also examined for ER binding under these
conditions (30); ER was equally recruited to the TFF1 promoter upon estradiol stimulation
in vector and PR-B expressing MCF7 cells (not shown).
To determine whether ER/PR-B complexes drive estradiol-dependent transcription of CTSD,
we again performed ChIP assays in PR-B expressing MCF7 cells treated with vehicle or

estradiol (40min) using antibodies specific for either ER or PR. As above, ER recruitment
was again observed upon estradiol stimulation of PR-B containing cells (Fig 4D). In
addition, PR recruitment to the CTSD promoter was detected after estradiol stimulation of
MCF7 cells (Fig 4D), though at lower levels than ER recruitment. Similar results were
observed in T47D cells stably expressing PR-B (not shown). Although PR recruitment to the
CTSD promoter was not as robust as ER recruitment, the PR antagonist onapristone
diminished estradiol-induced ER binding to the CTSD promoter (Fig 4E) and blocked
estradiol-induced CTSD mRNA expression (Fig 4F) in MCF7L (PR high) cells. These
studies further indicate that unliganded PR-B facilitates ER in the regulation of select
estradiol-induced genes.
Unliganded PR-B facilitates phosphorylation of specific ER residues in the presence of
estradiol or growth factors

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Previous reports demonstrated that PR-B and ER interact with c-Src as part of tyrosine
kinase-associated signaling complexes that function to initiate rapid activation of
downstream kinase pathways in response to steroid hormones (6, 19). One function of SRcontaining rapid signaling complexes is to ensure appropriate phosphorylation of ligandbound steroid hormone receptors that in turn regulate SR-dependent genomic events (8, 31).
To examine whether PR-B regulates ER phosphorylation, MCF7 cells expressing vector or
PR-B were stimulated with estradiol for 1 hour prior to Western blotting with phosphospecific antibodies. IGF-1 treatment was included as a positive control for ER Ser167
phosphorylation (26). IRS1, a PR-B target gene and IGF1R adaptor molecule, exhibited
slightly higher expression in PR-B expressing cells. Interestingly, MCF7 cells expressing
PR-B exhibited higher basal (Fig 5A, lanes 1 versus 4) and estradiol-stimulated (Fig 5A,
lanes 2 versus 5) Ser118 phosphorylation of ER relative to controls. IGF1, but not estradiol,
induced ER phospho-Ser167 in MCF7 cells lacking PR-B. However, when PR-B was
expressed, basal phosphorylation levels of ER Ser167 increased (lanes 1 and 4). In addition,
this site was appreciably phosphorylated in response to both estradiol and IGF1 (lanes 5 and
6). These data suggest that in the absence of added progestin, PR-B expression serves to
increase the ability of estradiol or growth factors (IGF1) to initiate ER-specific
phosphorylation events, perhaps via scaffolding of localized cytoplasmic or membraneassociated signaling complexes.
PELP1 is part of ER/PR-B-containing transcriptional complex and is recruited to the CTSD
promoter

Author Manuscript

Estradiol-bound ER participates in cytoplasmic signaling complexes that include protein
kinases (c-Src, PI3K), growth factor receptors (IGF1R, EGFR), and scaffolding molecules
(PELP-1 [MNAR]) (18, 20, 32, 33). PELP1 functions to modulate ER activity by acting as a
scaffolding molecule for effective cytoplasmic signaling and as an ER transcriptional
coactivator in the nucleus (32). We speculated that PELP1 might enhance local kinase
signaling (ie, ER phosphorylation). To determine whether PR-B participates in a signaling
complex with ER and PELP1, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in MCF7 cells
transiently transfected with PR-B and treated cells for 10 min with vehicle, estradiol, or
IGF-1. PR-specific immunoprecipitates, but not IgG controls, contained abundant PELP1
and low levels of estradiol-induced IGF1R (Fig 5B). IGF1R and ER were also weakly

detected in PELP1 immunoprecipitates from PR-B expressing MCF7 cells (Fig S6A). Coimmunoprecipitaion of ER and PR, recently published (14), was confirmed in our system
(not shown). In addition, PELP1, ER, and PR displayed robust binding to the CTSD distal
promoter in response to estradiol treatment but not vehicle treatment (Fig 5C). Interestingly,
we also consistently detected weak recruitment of IGF1R to the same region of the CTSD
promoter. However, this signaling complex (ER, PR, PELP1, and IGF1R) was not detected
on the TFF1 promoter (not shown). These data suggest that cytoplasmic signaling
complexes containing ER, PR, PELP1, and IGF1R appear to directly participate in CTSD
gene regulation as part of transcriptional complexes associated with chromatin.
IGF1R- and AKT-dependent signaling events are required for CTSD regulation

Author Manuscript

Previous findings have shown that cytoplasmic PELP1 is an enhancer of both MAPK and
AKT signaling, leading to increased ER phosphorylation on Ser167 and Ser118 and
enhanced transcriptional activity (34). Using a previously characterized ΔNLS PELP1
mutant that is localized primarily to the cytoplasm (34), we found that CTSD mRNA
expression was higher in cells expressing cytoplasmic ΔNLS PELP1 than in cells expressing
wt PELP1 or cells expressing vector alone (Fig S6B). These data indicate that PELP1dependent signaling (ie, heightened rapid signaling events) may enhance specific
transcriptional responses mediated by ER, PR, and PELP1-containing complexes.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether PELP1-associated kinase activities are required for estradiol-induced
CTSD expression, PR-B+ MCF7 cells were pre-treated with inhibitors of IGF1R (AEW541),
PI3K (LY-294002), MAPK (U0126), and c-Src (PP2). Estradiol-mediated activation of
CTSD expression was then examined by qRT-PCR. None of these kinase inhibitors affected
basal CTSD mRNA expression in PR-B+ MCF7 cells. PI3K or IGF1R inhibition blocked
estradiol-induced CTSD expression (Fig 5D). In addition, IGF1R inhibition specifically
blocked phosphorylation of ER Ser167 but not Ser118 (inset). In contrast, neither PI3K nor
IGF1R inhibition affected estradiol-mediated TFF1 expression (Fig 5D). MAPK inhibition
with U0126 blocked estradiol-induced CTSD and TFF1 expression (not shown).
Surprisingly, c-Src inhibition with PP2 did not significantly alter estradiol-induced CTSD or
TFF1 expression, but it did inhibit CCND1 expression, a Src-dependent (positive control)
gene (not shown) (35). In ChIP assays, IGF1R inhibition with AEW541 blocked estradiolinduced ER binding to the CTSD promoter; however, it did not affect estradiol-induced ER
recruitment to the TFF1 promoter (Fig 5E). Together, these data support a role for ER/PRB/PELP1 complexes in activation of IGF1R and downstream PI3K/AKT signaling in the
regulation of CTSD expression.

Dual PR and IGF1R blockade inhibits growth of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells
As shown above, blockade of either PR or IGF1R partially reduced estradiol-induced ER
binding to the CTSD promoter and blocked CTSD mRNA expression. To determine the
effect of dual blockade of PR and IGF1R, we performed soft agar assays in tamoxifensensitive (MCF7L) and -resistant (MCF7 1GX) cell variants. PR+/IGF1R+ tamoxifenresistant MCF7 1GX cells were engineered to overexpress RAF1 and passaged once as
xenografts in mice (36). Estradiol-induced colony formation was lower among MCF7L cells
treated with onapristone and AEW541 than among cells treated with either agent alone (Fig

6A). In the presence of tamoxifen, estradiol-treated MCF7 1GX cells exhibited robust
colony formation; however, onapristone significantly decreased basal and estradiol-induced
growth in soft agar (Fig 6B). Importantly, estradiol-induced colony formation was
completely blocked among MCF7 1GX cells treated with onapristone and AEW541 (Fig
6C). These data suggest that PR-B and IGF1R expression alter ER transcriptional programs
to enhance breast cancer growth even in the context of tamoxifen resistance, perhaps by resensitizing cells to tamoxifen.
ER/PR/PELP1 complexes are detectable in human breast tumors

Author Manuscript

To determine whether the ER/PR/PELP1 signaling complex is present in breast cancer in
vivo, we obtained human tumor samples and performed co-immunoprecipitation studies.
Nine tumor samples, clinically determined to be ER+/PR+, expressed PELP1, PR, ER, and
actin (loading control) in Western blots (Fig 7A). Pull-down of PELP1 revealed that PELP1
had a strong association with ER and a variable, yet persistent, association with PR. In
addition, ER and PELP1 co-immunoprecipitated with PR in breast tumors, and PELP1 and
PR co-immunoprecipitated with ER (not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that
ER/PR/PELP1 form complexes in human breast cancers, the consequence of which is likely
more aggressive proliferative responses to estrogens.

Discussion

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The classical definition of PR function is that the receptor is a ligand-activated transcription
factor whose promoter selection is driven by rapid cytoplasmic phosphorylation events (8).
Herein, we extend this definition by showing that unliganded PR-B acts as a molecular
scaffold for the formation of an ER/PELP1-containing transcription complex at newly
defined ER/PR-B-target genes. We found that, in the absence of added progestin, the PR-B
isoform activated a subset of ER-target genes in estradiol-mediated pathways to enhance
breast cancer cell proliferation and anchorage independent growth in multiple cell line
models (MCF7, T47D, and BT474). In this context, PR-B associated with ER and PELP1 in
vitro and in vivo to form a transcriptional complex on select ER-target genes, including
CTSD. The ER/PR-B/PELP1 complex facilitated the phosphorylation of specific ER sites
and activation of IGF1R downstream PI3K/AKT signaling in the regulation of CTSD. We
also detected IGF1R at the same region of the CTSD promoter. Inhibition of IGF1R, PR, or
both blocked estradiol-dependent breast cancer cell proliferation. Importantly, our gene
profiling studies indicated that PR-B cross-talk with ER results in more aggressive
proliferative responses to estrogens and shifts the ER transcriptome towards the luminal-B
phenotype, which is more likely to become tamoxifen resistant. Taken together, our data
support a model (Fig 7B) in which PR-B/ER/PELP1 complexes formed at, or near, the
membrane with growth factor receptors (ie, IGF1R) are capable of initiating signaling events
(ie, ER phosphorylation) that direct these complexes to specific promoters (ie, CTSD) and
thereby activate particular gene sets and their biological programs. Novel ER/PR/PELP1
target genes may provide useful biomarkers for selection of patients likely to respond to
antagonism of components of this transcriptional complex or its related signaling pathways.

PR-B DNA-binding domain was required for ER recruitment to target genes

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our study shows that unliganded PR-B facilitates estradiol-induced ER interactions with
kinases (eg, IGF1R, AKT) perhaps in part due to increased PR-B driven IRS1 expression
(37). However, the specific function of unliganded PR-B in the ER/PELP1/IGF1R
transcriptional complex is likely multifold. We found that the PR-B DNA-binding domain
was required for ER recruitment to the CTSD promoter. Direct PR binding to EREcontaining DNA enhancer regions has been reported (38), though it is also possible that PRB interacts with a PRE located on a distant region of DNA that loops back to the CTSD
region and thereby brings together regulatory regions across large expanses of DNA (39).
Related to this idea, we identified numerous PRE half sites in close proximity to the CTSD
distal ERE, but PR-B recruitment to these sites was not specifically detected in our ChIP
assays (not shown). Notably, the ER/PR cooperative mechanism described herein appears
distinct from previous descriptions of ER/PR crosstalk upon stimulation of breast cancer
cells with progestin (14). In our study focused on ligand-independent PR actions, ChIP
assays failed to detect ER/PR/PELP1 complexes in association with either the MYC or
CCND1 genes in response to estradiol (not shown).
IGF1R/PI3K pathway contributes to estradiol-induced, ER/PR-B-mediated breast cancer
growth

Author Manuscript

ER/PR/PELP1-mediated activation of growth-promoting transcriptional programs described
herein required IGF1R and PI3K/AKT activation. These findings underscore the interest in
PI3K as an attractive target for endocrine-resistant patients (40). Indeed, activating
mutations in PI3K or AKT occur in up to 25% of breast cancers (41). Additionally,
phosphorylation of Ser167, the AKT site on ER-alpha, reduces sensitivity to tamoxifen in
vitro (42, 43). Similarly, hyperactive IGF signaling is associated with resistance to endocrine
therapies (44). Notably, blockade of IGF1R with dalotuzumab significantly decreases
estradiol-stimulated growth in MCF7L (PR+) xenografts (45). We found that the
combination of AEW541 and onapristone completely abolished estradiol-dependent soft
agar colony formation in similar MCF7L and tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 1GX cells.
However, even though onapristone blocks PR-containing transcriptional complexes, it
leaves upstream (AKT) signaling intact. These findings suggest that combining IGF1R and
PR antagonists may provide a means to block endocrine-resistant, ER+/PR+ tumors via
targeting these distinct but highly cooperative pathways.
Breast cancer therapy and ER/PR crosstalk

Author Manuscript

As a classical ER-target gene, PR expression is used as a clinical marker of functional ER in
breast tumors and thus predicts the likelihood of effective response to ER-targeted therapies.
Our data linking heightened estrogen sensitivity to PR scaffolding activity lend additional
mechanistic support to these long-held clinical findings. Indeed, our studies underscore the
need to consider PR is an active member of ER-containing transcriptional complexes.
Interestingly, clinical assessment of PR expression by IHC in breast tumors does not
distinguish between PR-A and PR-B isoforms. PR-A expression is highly estrogendependent, while PR-B expression is also regulated by other factors (46). Notably, the
scaffolding activity of PR-B described herein occurs in the absence of added progestin, and

ER/PR/PELP1-target genes are unresponsive to added progestin. These genes clearly
contribute to breast cancer growth and survival phenotypes. We were surprised that both
luminal-B and tamoxifen-resistant gene sets were enriched in estradiol-treated MCF7 cells
expressing PR-B relative to PR-null cells. While more studies are needed, these provocative
data suggest that in the presence of estrogen, PR-B may in fact be required for transition of
luminal-A breast cancer cells to the luminal-B sub-type.

Author Manuscript

In sum, inclusion of PR-targeted therapies as part of the modern endocrine arsenal seems
warranted and timely. Notably, over half of acquired endocrine-resistant tumors retain PR
expression (47, 48). Furthermore, PR activates many of the same genes as ER (7), and PR is
a major driver of proliferative and pro-survival pathways in the breast and in breast cancer
(8). Herein, we show that PR-B contributes to estrogen responsiveness via direct ER/PELP1
cross talk at classical estrogen-dependent genes. Thus, combination treatment with both PRand ER-targeted therapies may provide significant clinical benefit. Indeed, in rat models,
additive effects of tamoxifen and onapristone were observed in mammary cancers induced
by DMBA or MNU (reviewed in (49)). Additionally, onapristone (and to a lesser extent
RU486) inhibited tumor growth and estrogen stimulation in the MXT mouse model of breast
cancer (49). Similarly, treatment of MCF7 and T47D cells with either tamoxifen or RU486
blocked estrogen-mediated cell proliferation (49). It is thus tempting to speculate that PR-B
in PELP1/ER complexes may function to compensate for ER inhibition in tumors that
progress under estrogen- or ER-blocking therapies. As such, we conclude that
antiprogestins, perhaps given early as intermittent or cyclical treatments, in combination
with current endocrine therapies may prevent or delay endocrine failure in patients with
luminal tumors expressing novel ER/PR-B-target gene biomarkers.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
T47D-Y (PR-null) and MCF7 (PR-low) (19) cells were stably transfected with pSG5 or
pSG5-PR-B and pSV-Neo or pIRES or pIRES-PR-B using FuGENE reagent
(ThermoFisher) to generate multiple vector matched clones. Cells were cultured as
previously described (12, 19). Additional MCF7 cells were obtained from ATCC (PR-A/B
+), cultured as indicated, and stably infected with retrovirus expressing LXSN, LXSNwtPELP1, or LXSN-ΔNLS PELP1 (34). MCF7C4-12 (PR-null), MCF7L (PR-A/B+),
BT474 (PR-A/B+), and MCF7 1GX (PR-A/B+) cells were cultured as described (12, 26, 36,
50), MCF7L PR knockdown cells were generated using lentivirus shRNAs targeting PR (5
sequences) or GFP in pLKO (ThermoFisher).

Proliferation assays

Author Manuscript

MTT and soft agar assays were performed as previously described (with three biological
replicates of each condition per experiment) and results presented are representative of two
to five experimental repeats (12, 18). Student’s T-test was performed to determine statistical
significance between treatment groups in each experiment.
Western blots (WB) and Immunoprecipitation (IP) Assays
WB and co-IPs were performed as previously described (12). The following specific
antibodies were employed: PR-A and -B ab-8 (ThermoFisher), PELP1 (Bethyl
Laboratories), PR-A and B H190, IGF1Rβ, ER (SantaCruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz,
CA), actin (Sigma-Aldrich), ER phospho-167, ER phospho-118, and Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling,
Beverly, MA).

qRT-PCR
RNA was isolated from cells in triplicate wells treated with ethanol (vehicle) or estradiol
(1nM) for 24 hours using TriReagent (Roche). Data shown is representative of two to nine
replicates of each qPCR experiment which was performed as previously described (12).
Student’s T-tests were performed to determine statistical significance between treatment
groups in each experiment.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay

Author Manuscript

ChIP assays were performed using ChIPit express kits (ActiveMotif, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol as previously described (12) and antibodies
specific for PR (ab-8) and ER (Santa Cruz). Briefly, MCF7 (7×106) or T47D (15×106) cells
were plated in 150mm dishes, starved in unsupplemented phenol red free IMEM (24h), and
treated for 40min or 1hr with ethanol or estradiol. Relative recruitment was determined by
qPCR of purified ChIP and input DNA in triplicate. The results presented are representative
of two to eight independent experimental repeats.
Whole genome expression analysis

Author Manuscript

Vector matched MCF7 cells stably expressing pSG5 or pSG5-PR-B were serum starved in
modified IMEM (Gibco) for 1day and treated with estradiol or ethanol (6h) before RNA
extraction using a RNeasy kit (QIAgen). RNA samples in triplicate were prepared for
expression analysis using the Illumina HT-12v4 bead chip platform according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. Gene expression normalization and analysis was completed as
previously described (12). Heatmap genes were significantly regulated >3 fold, Benjamini
and Hochberg adjusted P value < 0.001. All gene expression data is available in the NCBI
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, accession number: GSE45643 (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=prknleoqgaqgkxc&acc=GSE45643).
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity® Systems, www.ingenuity.com) was
used to investigate genes up or downregulated after estradiol treatment in MCF7 cells
expressing PR-B as previously described (12); genes with fold change >2.8 were included in

the analysis (BH adjusted P <0.01 in the sample comparison: [PR E2/PR vehicle] versus
[vector E2/vector vehicle]).
Human breast cancer tissue studies
De-identified frozen breast cancer tissues were obtained from patients with known ER+ PR+
breast tumors from the UT Southwestern tissue core. Immunohistochemical staining of
matching specimens revealed that ER/PR expression in these tumor samples was largely
restricted to the tumor with little to no expression in the surrounding stroma. Total tissue
protein was extracted using lysis buffer [50mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5mM MgCl2] containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Lysates
(100μg) were subject to immunoprecipitation.

subline C4-12) cells transiently transfected with ER and PR-B were starved and treated with
estradiol or IGF-1 (10min). PR-containing complexes were isolated using PR-specific
antibodies and protein G-agarose beads. Western blots were performed on
immunocomplexes and whole cell lysates (N.B.; non-specfic band). (C) ChIP assays were
performed in MCF7 pSG5-PRB cells treated with vehicle or estradiol (40min). CTSD distal
promoter chromatin from immunocomplexes isolated by using antibodies specific for ER,
PR, PELP1, or IGF1R was evaluated with qRT-PCR and normalized to inputs. Values are
expressed as estradiol-induced fold change over vehicle. Data represent the average of 3–5
independent experimental repeats. (D) MCF7 cells were treated with vehicle, AEW541, or
LY-294002 and vehicle or estradiol (24h). Cells were subjected qRT-PCR to asses CTSD
and TFF1 mRNA levels normalized to housekeeper genes. Values are expressed as the
average estradiol-induced fold change over vehicle. Data represent the average of 3
independent experimental repeats. (Inset) Western blots of MCF7L cells treated with vehicle
or estradiol and vehicle or AEW541 (1h). (E) ChIP assay of ER recruitment to the CTSD
distal and TFF1 promoters in MCF7L cell treated with vehicle, estradiol, AEW541, or both
estradiol and AEW541 for 40 min. Values, expressed as a percent of input controls, are
representative of 3 independent experiments.

PR antagonist blocks estradiol-stimulated growth and sensitizes breast cancer cells to
tamoxifen. (A) Soft agar colony formation of MCF7L cells grown in ethanol, estradiol,
AEW, or onapristone (7 days). (B) Soft agar colony formation of MCF7 1GX cells treated
with tamoxifen and either vehicle, estradiol, onapristone, or both (7 days). (C) Soft agar
colony formation of MCF7 1GX cells treated with tamoxifen and estradiol and either
vehicle, onapristone, AEW, or both (7 days) (±SEM, * p<0.05).

PR/ER/PELP1 containing complexes in human breast cancer samples. (A) Protein
complexes were isolated from nine human tumor samples using PELP1-specific antibodies.
Western blots were performed on immunocomplexes and input controls. Actin was used as a
loading control. (B) PR-B is a component of a transcriptional complex where it coordinates
estradiol-induced signaling to alter ER-mediated gene regulation.
