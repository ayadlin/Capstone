BACKGROUND: Currently, no standard therapy exists for patients with relapsed and/or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who are ineligible for transplantation or who have failed after bone marrow transplantation. The
authors of this report investigated the safety and efficacy of clofarabine (CLO) in these patients. METHODS: In a
2-step, open-label study, CLO (as a 1-hour intravenous infusion given daily for 5 days) was given every 28 days (maximum, 6 cycles). In the phase 1 portion (n ¼ 7; standard 3 þ 3 study design), the dose was escalated by 2 mg/m2 to
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The phase 2 study (n ¼ 26) was initiated at the MTD, and patients
were followed until disease progression. RESULTS: Of 33 patients who were enrolled, 31 patients (median age, 69
years) were evaluable; 24% failed after previous stem cell transplantation, and 72% were rituximab-refractory. The
MTD for CLO was 4 mg/m2. The overall response rate was 42%. Seven patients (23%) achieved a complete response,
and 6 patients (19%) achieved a partial response. The median response duration was 5 months. Among the rituximab-refractory patients, the overall response rate was 47% (complete response rate, 28%), and the median response
duration was 7 months. At a median follow-up of 14 months, 45% of patients remained alive (median overall survival,
10 months). Toxicity was mainly hematologic (60% of patients had neutropenia or thrombocytopenia). Nonhematologic toxicity included tumor lysis syndrome, infection, and renal insufficiency (in 6% of patients each). No treatmentrelated mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent CLO was active and was tolerated well in patients
with refractory NHL, including patients in a rituximab-refractory subset. Reversible myelosuppression was the major

Chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab-based combination regimens has become the standard front-line

approach in low-grade and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).1-4 Treatment options for patients with recurrent
disease vary, depending on the patient’s age, performance status, sensitivity to chemotherapy, and disease histology.
Patients with recurrent disease who have aggressive histology have a poor prognosis. The use of salvage chemotherapy in
these patients reportedly yielded 2-year survival rates of <30%5,6; and, despite the addition of rituximab, the results have
remained dismal.3 However, the addition of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has improved these outcomes to a 5-year even-free rate of 46%.7 Yet HSCT is not feasible in all patients
because of advanced age, comorbidities, poor performance status, and chemotherapy resistance.8 In addition, patients
who develop recurrent disease after undergoing HSCT have very limited therapeutic choices, and their median survival is

measured in months. Patients who have disease with lowgrade histology have more therapeutic choices, although
none provides refractory patients with prolonged remission duration. Options include radioimmunotherapy
with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or tositumomab, alternate second-line chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy, and HSCT.9-11 Unfortunately, many patients
remain resistant to all treatments, including HSCT. No
standard therapy exists for patients who fail HSCT, those
who are ineligible for transplantation, and those who do
not respond to second-line therapy. Thus, there is a need
for active agents in patients with NHL who have relapsed
and/or refractory disease regardless of histology.
Clofarabine (CLO) (Clolar; Genzyme, Cambridge,
Mass) is a second-generation deoxyadenosine nucleoside
analog that combines the favorable pharmacokinetic
properties of fludarabine and cladribine with reduced
neurotoxicity.12 Its mechanism of action involves a combination of direct inhibition of DNA synthesis and
ribonucleotide reductase together with induction of apoptosis.13 CLO has demonstrated activity as a single agent
in patients with acute lymphoid leukemia and has received
accelerated approval for pediatric patients with relapsed/
refractory acute lymphoid leukemia after at least 2 prior
therapeutic attempts.14 In addition, several studies have
confirmed the safety and activity of CLO in myeloid leukemias and myelodysplasia.15,16 Given the reported activity of other purine analogues in lymphoid malignancies
and the lack of therapeutic choices for patients with
relapsed and/or refractory NHL, we conducted an openlabel phase 1/2 clinical trial investigating the efficacy and
safety of CLO in patients with relapsed and/or refractory
NHL regardless of cell histology or grade. To our knowledge, this is the first reported trial of CLO in patients with
NHL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Design and Objectives
In this open-label, 2-step, phase 1/2 trial, we assessed the
use of CLO administered daily for 5 consecutive days and
repeated every 28 days for a maximum of 6 cycles in
patients with relapsed and/or refractory NHL. The phase
1 objective was to establish the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) of CLO in this patient population. Subsequently,
a phase 2 study was initiated to determine the overall
response rate (ORR), which was assessed using International Response Criteria,17 and progression-free survival
(PFS) and to define toxicity, which was measured using

National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.18 In the phase 1
portion of the study, a standard 3 þ 3 design was implemented; patients were started on 4 mg/m2, and the dose
was escalated by 2 mg/m2 per cohort. Dose escalation
could proceed if none of the first 3 patients experienced a
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). If 1 patient experienced a
DLT, then 3 additional patients were enrolled at the same
dose level. The MTD was defined as the dose level at
which 1 of 6 patients experienced a drug-related DLT
with the next higher dose level provoking a DLT in 2 of 6
patients.
The phase 2 portion of the trial was initiated at the
MTD. The plan in each phase was to treat either until the
patient developed disease progression or for a maximum
of 6 cycles, whichever occurred first.
The trial was approved by the Institutional Review
Board and met the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki for Human Subject Protection. All patients provided
written, informed consent.
Eligibility Criteria
Eligible patients were aged 18 years and had histologically confirmed NHL of B-cell or T-cell lineage with
measurable disease on a computed tomography scan and/
or evaluable on a positron emission tomography scan. All
enrolled patients must have failed on a previous standard
chemotherapy regimen with or without monoclonal
antibody-based therapy. Patients had to demonstrate
adequate Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, performance status (2), were required to have a life expectancy
12 weeks, and had to have appropriate organ function
(creatinine 2 mg/dL; aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels 3 times the upper limit of normal, total bilirubin 2 mg/dL, neutrophils 1500/mm3, and platelets
100,000/mm3). Cytopenia, if present, had to be related
to bone marrow involvement with disease.
Standard exclusion criteria were implemented,
including active or untreated central nervous system lymphoma, human immunodeficiency virus-positive–related
lymphoma, autologous HSCT (within the previous 3
months), a history of allogeneic bone marrow or organ
transplantation, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
Those with bulky disease (any lymph node >10 cm) or
with circulating malignant lymphocytes >24,000 cells/
lL were excluded. Ineligibility also included chronic
treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (>1 mg/kg
daily) and any anticancer therapy in the 3 weeks
before study entry. Short-term, low-dose corticosteroid

administration and analgesic, antiemetic, antidiarrheal,
and anti-infective therapies were permitted. Treatment
with granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor and allopurinol for those at high risk for tumor lysis was at the discretion of the investigator.
Treatment Plan
In the phase 1 portion of the study, patients were enrolled
in cohorts of 3 starting at CLO 4 mg/m2. The dose was
escalated by 2 mg/m2 per cohort if no DLTs were witnessed. If a DLT was observed among the first 3 patients,
then an additional 3 patients were enrolled at the same
dose level. Dose escalation was then allowed if no DLT
was demonstrated among the 3 additional enrolled
patients. Once the MTD was determined, the phase 2
portion of the trial was initiated at that dose level and
continued until accrual was completed. Patients received
antiherpes simplex and antipneumocystis Jiroveci prophylaxis. CLO was given for at least 2 cycles before response
assessment and was continued for a maximum of 6 cycles,
until disease progression, or patient withdrawal.
Dose-Limiting Toxicity
Dose-limiting toxicities were defined as any drug-related
grade 4 neutropenia or grade 3 febrile neutropenia that
lasted until 24 hours before the beginning of the next cycle
despite the use of growth factor support; grade 4 drugrelated thrombocytopenia that did not resolve before the
next cycle begins; grade 4 drug-related nonhematologic

toxicity and/or grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
in patients who received optimal treatment with antiemetics and antidiarrheals if they did not resolve to grade 1 or
less within 24 hours of starting the subsequent cycle; and
grade 4 drug-related elevations in liver function tests (alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels, bilirubin, and
alkaline phosphatase). Optimal therapy for these events
was guided by the investigator and reflected appropriate
standards in similar circumstances. Growth factor support
was allowed at any grade at the investigator’s discretion.
In the phase 2 portion of the trial, cycles may have been
delayed for up to 2 weeks to allow resolution of drugrelated toxicities. Patients who required a delay >2 weeks
were taken off study (Table 1).
Response Assessment
Responses were assessed every 2 cycles. Complete response
(CR) and partial response (PR) were confirmed in each
patient 4 weeks after the first documentation. The remaining patients were categorized with either stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). Repeated imaging
studies of involved areas were obtained using computed
tomography. Bone marrow biopsies were repeated if bone
originally was involved in patients who achieved a CR
radiographically to confirm remission. Overall survival
(OS) was calculated from enrollment until death. PFS was
calculated from study entry until progression or death,
whichever occurred first, and patients who remained alive
and relapse free at the last follow-up were censored. Any

patient who progressed on a rituximab-containing regimen or on single-agent rituximab within 6 months from
enrollment was considered rituximab-refractory.
Statistical Analysis
The primary variables that were included in statistical
analyses were MTD, ORR, and toxicity. The inclusion of
25 patients in the phase 2 portion allowed for an 80%
power to detect at response rate of 10% with 95% accuracy (P < .05). We estimated that a response rate 10%
would be acceptable to justify continued investigation of
this agent in this refractory patient population. Descriptive statistics were used to report medians, ranges, and percentages. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
PFS and OS.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Table 2 lists the characteristics of all patients who were enrolled on this study. In total, 33 patients were enrolled,
and their median age was 69 years (range, 27-88 years).
All patients had failed on prior standard therapies and had
received a median of 3 prior regimens (range, 1-8 prior
regimens). Four patients had T-cell NHL, and 29 patients
had B-cell NHL. All 29 patients with B-cell NHL had
received rituximab previously, and 21 of those 29 patients
(72%) were rituximab-refractory. All patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) had failed prior radioimmunotherapy, and 7 of 33 patients (21%) had failed prior
autologous HSCT.
Among the enrolled patients, histology included 12
patients (36%) with diffuse large B-cell NHL (DLBCL),
5 patients (15%) with follicular NHL (FL), 5 patients
(15%) with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), 4
patients (12%) with T-cell NHL, and 7 patients (21%)
with other histologies (2 patients with peripheral T-cell
lymphoma, 1 patient each with marginal zone lymphoma,
mantle cell lymphoma, mixed histology, transformed
lymphoma, and Richter transformation).
Phase 1
Seven patients were enrolled in the phase 1 portion of the
study, including 3 patients in Cohort 1 (CLO 4 mg/m2)
and 4 patients in Cohort 2 (CLO 6 mg/m2). Two of the 4
patients who were enrolled in Cohort 2 developed a DLT,
specifically, thrombocytopenia. Accordingly, the phase 2
portion was started at CLO 4 mg/m2.

Response Rate
Although the phase 1 portion of the study was designed to

phase and decided to evaluate response based on all
patients enrolled (phases 1 and 2). Thirty-one of 33
patients were evaluable for response (Fig. 1) (1 patient
had missing data, and 1 patient withdrew consent). Thirteen patients (41%) responded, including 7 patients
(23%) who achieved a CR and 6 patients (19%) who
achieved a PR (Table 3). Six patients (19%) remained stable, and 12 patients (39%) failed to respond. The 13 responders included 4 patients with DLBCL, 3 patients with
FL, and 3 patients with SLL (Table 4). Excluding the
responding patients who received the higher dose (CLO 6
mg/m2), 10 patients responded at the phase 2 dose of

dose of CLO 6 mg/m2, 8 patients who were treated at the
phase 2 dose of CLO 4 mg/m2 responded (ORR, 38%).
Because almost 50% of rituximab-refractory
patients responded to therapy, we attempted an exploratory analysis of these 21 patients to examine potential
associations and predictors of response. Recognizing the
small number, Fisher exact tests and Mann-Whitney tests
were performed on the following variables: age; race
(reference category, Caucasian); sex (reference category,
woman); performance status; number of CLO cycles;
number of prior therapies; serum albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine levels at enrollment; time (in
months) from diagnosis to first cycle of CLO; previous
anthracycline exposure; previous purine analogue treatment; and previous HSCT. None of these variables were
associated statistically with response.

patients was 7 months (range, from 3 months to 33
months). It is noteworthy that the median response duration after patients were taken off study was 4 months
(range, 1-36 months). With a median follow-up of 14
months, the median OS was 10 months (range, 2-36
months); as of December 2009, 15 patients (45%) were
alive, including 3 patients who remained in CR at 4
months, 14 months, and 36 months. One patient remained
in PR at 6 months. In addition, 2 patients underwent
HSCT. The estimated PFS at 36 months was 17%, and the
median PFS for all patients was 6 months (95% CI, 3-11
months) (Fig. 2). The median number of CLO cycles
received was 4, because 11 patients (33%) demonstrated
PD during chemotherapy and were taken off study. Eight
patients (24%) completed 6 cycles of therapy.
Toxicity
The most common toxicity, as expected, was myelosuppression: Greater than 60% of patients exhibited neutropenia or thrombocytopenia with a severity of grade 3 or
greater (Table 6). Myelosuppression alone resulted in a
dose reduction in 13 of the 26 patients (50%) who were
enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the study. Individual
nonhematologic adverse events were recorded in <10%
of patients, and the most common nonhematologic events
were grade 3 or greater tumor lysis, infectious episodes
(pneumonia and bilateral cellulites), and renal insufficiency. Grade 1/2 adverse events that were noted during
this trial included fatigue (12% of patients); joint pain
(9% of patients); hyperglycemia, shortness of breath, anorexia, abdominal pain, and skin rash (6% of patients

each); and palpitations, hypotension, penile edema, weakness, heartburn, urinary tract infection, and pharyngitis
(3% of patients each).
The median delay to the next treatment cycle for all
causes was 1 week. All patients required growth factor
support, 39% of patients required hospitalization, and
there was no treatment-related mortality. No patient was
taken off study because of prolonged leukopenia, because
growth factors eventually were received by all patients.
However, 7 patients (21%) were taken off study without
PD because of prolonged thrombocytopenia. Of those 7
patients, 4 patients completed 5 cycles, 1 patient completed 1 cycle, 1 patient completed 2 cycles, and 1 patient
completed 3 cycles.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current trial is the first completed
study of CLO in patients with NHL. In this study, we
demonstrated that CLO is safe and effective in heavily
pretreated patients with relapsed and/or refractory NHL
with an ORR of 41% (32% if we exclude responses at the
6 mg/m2 dose level). Furthermore, we demonstrated that
CLO is effective in rituximab-refractory patients with an
ORR of 47% (38% if we exclude responses at the 6 mg/
m2 dose level) and a median response duration of 7
months in this subgroup of patients. It is noteworthy that
responses were achieved across a range of histologies.
One other study evaluated CLO in patients with
relapsed or refractory DLBCL or mantle cell lymphoma.

1495

Original Article

In that study, although responses were reported, the dose
used was substantially higher than our MTD (CLO 40
mg/m2 as an infusion for 5 days repeated every 28 days),
and the trial was terminated prematurely because of myelosuppression. The median PFS in that study was 3.5
months.19 Serious concerns were raised regarding the dose
used in that study, because myelosuppression could have
been prevented with lower doses.20 In fact, earlier phase 1
studies indicated that CLO is effective and safe in patients
with relapsed/refractory NHL when given at much lower
doses.21
Currently, few therapeutic choices are available for
rituximab-refractory patients. Bendamustine (120 mg/m2
on Days 1 and 2 every 28 days) has been investigated in
patients with resistant and/or refractory NHL. By using
that schedule, Friedberg et al conducted a phase 2 study in
74 patients with indolent (80%) or transformed (20%),
rituximab-refractory NHL.22 Despite an ORR of 77%,
the median response duration was 6.7 months for patients
who had indolent histology and 2.3 months for patients
who had transformed disease. Similarly, another study of
bendamustine reported an ORR of 75% in 100 patients
with rituximab-refractory indolent B-cell NHL who had a
median response duration of 9.2 months.23 Neither
study, however, enrolled patients who had refractory
DLBCL or T-cell lineage. However, the reported response
duration with bendamustine appears to be the desired
outcome when single-agent therapy is implemented in
this setting. In our study, rituximab-refractory patients
(72%) had a median response duration of 7 months, comparable to what has been reported with bendamustine.
The different response rates witnessed are explained in
part by differences in the studied patient populations. The
bendamustine studies22,23 included mainly patients who
had indolent histology and few transformed individuals,
whereas we included heavily pretreated patients who had
received with up to 8 previous chemotherapy regimens
and patients with all types (indolent and aggressive) of
relapsed/refractory NHL.
The toxicity observed in our study reflected the predominantly known, reversible myelosuppressive effects of
CLO. This toxicity, however, was controlled with growth
factor support. The high percentage of patients experiencing hematologic toxicity is multifactorial and may be
explained by the poor bone marrow reserve in a heavily
pretreated patient population along with exposure to
CLO, a purine nucleoside analogue that has known bone
marrow toxicity. Despite this, using growth factors
allowed us to administer the drug safely in an outpatient

1496

setting with few hospitalizations. No alopecia, mucositis,
or significant gastrointestinal toxicity was witnessed.
The strength of our study lies in the finding that, to
date, no standard therapy has been established for any of
the patients who were enrolled. All those with low-grade
FL had failed on previous radioimmunotherapy. Patients
who had more aggressive histology either had failed a
HSCT or were ineligible based on their age and comorbidities. Despite these unfavorable preconditions and the
very limited landscape of treatment options in such
patients, CLO provided our patients with encouraging
responses.
Combination therapy is the current standard of
front-line treatment for patients with NHL.24 CLO has
been combined safely with other agents, mainly in leukemias.15,25 Therefore, various CLO-based combination
regimens, and specifically those with monoclonal antibodies, are worth exploring in patients with recurrent or
refractory NHL to improve on our results.
In conclusion, in the current open-label study, we
observed that CLO administration provides a favorable
response in patients with NHL who have relapsed after
receiving multiple therapies and who are refractory to rituximab. The overall duration of survival in this study is
encouraging in terms of investigating this therapy further
in the relapsed or refractory setting and potentially moving this agent into the front-line setting. In addition,
CLO is tolerated well without significant adverse events,
except for myelosuppression, which can be explained by
the heavily pretreated patient population that we studied.
To our knowledge, our study is the first completed clinical
trial to demonstrate the clinical activity of CLO in
patients with refractory NHL. Larger studies on singleagent and combination therapy with CLO in specific histologic subtypes will help to clarify the potential place of
this drug in the treatment of NHL.
