ABSTRACT
The putative tumor suppressor gene spinophilin has been involved in cancer
progression in several types of cancer. In this study, we explored the prognostic
value of spinophilin expression in 162 colon adenocarcinoma patients. In addition, we
generated stably expressing spinophilin-directed shRNA CRC cell lines and studied the
influence of spinophilin expression on cellular phenotypes and molecular interactions.
We independently confirmed that low spinophilin expression levels are associated
with poor prognosis in CRC patients (p = 0.038). A reduction of spinophilin levels in
p53 wild-type HCT116 and p53-mutated Caco-2 cells led to increased cellular growth
rates and anchorage-independent growth (p<0.05). At molecular level, reduced
spinophilin levels increased the expression of the transcription factor E2F-1. In
addition, we observed an increased formation of tumor spheres, increased number
of CD133 positive cells and an increased resistance to 5-flourouracil (p<0.05). Finally,
treatment with the de-methylating agent 5-aza-dC increased spinophilin expression
in CRC cells (p<0.05), corroborated by a correlation of spinophilin expression and
extent of methylated CpG sites in the gene promoter region (p<0.001). In conclusion,
gain of aggressive biological properties of CRC cells including cellular growth, cancer
stem cell features and 5-flourouracil resistance partly explains the role of spinophilin
in CRC.

INTRODUCTION

within the last 10 years improved the survival, though
metastatic CRC represents an incurable disease in most
cases. Hence, there is a real need for the discovery of novel
prognostic and pathogenesis-driving factors to improve
clinical outcome of these patients [3-5]. Spinophilin (also
known as PPP1R9B and neurabin II) is a multifunctional
scaffold protein located at chromosome 17q21.33.
This chromosomal region is frequently associated with
microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity
(LOH), features frequently associated in the pathogenesis
of CRC [6, 7]. Previous studies also reported that low

Despite a decrease of incidence and mortality in
the last years, colorectal cancer (CRC) still remains the
most common cancer of the digestive system, associated
with high morbidity and mortality rates according to the
American Cancer Society in 2014 [1]. Depending on the
clinical stage at diagnosis, different treatment approaches
including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are
the mainstay of the therapeutic armamentarium [2]. The

levels of spinophilin expression in tumors are associated
with cancer progression and poor prognosis in lung,
kidney, head and neck cancer, and leukemia [6, 8].
Ferrer and colleagues demonstrated in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts that the loss of spinophilin contributes to high
levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb)
with the consequence of increased activation of the
tumor suppressor p53. In the absence of p53 or impaired
function by mutation, the cells develop a pro-proliferative
phenotype, given that the elevated pRb, which is
normally neutralized by p53, drives a pro-proliferative
state [9]. However, in two recently published studies of
hepatocellular carcinoma and CRC, loss of spinophilin was
associated with p53-independent cellular proliferation [10,
11]. In the first previously published study of spinophilin
in CRC, Estevez-Garcia et al. recently described a
correlation of spinophilin expression and advanced tumor
stages. Furthermore, low spinophilin expression was
associated with a more aggressive histologic phenotype,
faster relapse and poorer survival in their study [11].
However, an external validation of these findings is still
missing and the possible underlying cellular and molecular
mechanisms in CRC are poorly explored. Importantly, the
external validation of such newly identified prognostic risk
factors in independent cohorts of patients is paramount
prior to the generalization of the applicability of a
prognostic marker and some studies fail to replicate the
findings of others [12, 13]. Therefore, we validated the
influence of spinophilin expression on survival in CRC
on a large independent cohort of patients. Based on the
positive clinical data, we further studied the potential
cellular functions and molecular mechanisms of alterations
in spinophilin expression in CRC.

<0.05), whereas age, gender, location of the tumor and
microsatellite status were not significantly associated with
survival (data not shown). To test whether the prognostic
value of low spinophilin expression is independent of
other risk factors of poor survival, a multivariate analysis
was performed using a Cox proportional hazard model.
Multivariate analysis including all factors significant in
univariate analysis (clinical stage and level of spinophilin
expression) confirmed low spinophilin expression as an
independent predictor for poor survival in CRC patients
(hazard ratio = 3.02, 95% confidence interval =1.048.79, p<0.042). For a more detailed characterization
of the possible biological impact of low spinophilin
levels in CRC cells, we generated stably spinophilinsilenced CRC cell lines. For this purpose, we selected the
spinophilin high expressing HCT116 and the spinophilin
low expressing Caco-2 cell line (Supplementary Figure
S1). These two cell lines are also different with regard to
their p53 mutational status (HCT116: p53 wild-type and
Caco-2: p53 mutated, respectively). Generating stably
expressing spinophilin-directed shRNA cells, a relative
reduction to about 60% expression levels could be detected
(Supplementary Figure S2). Consecutively, we explored
the growth behavior of the spinophilin-silenced cells
using the WST-1 proliferation assay. In the p53 wild-type
HCT-116 cell line we observed a statistically significant

RESULTS
First of all, we measured spinophilin expression in
eleven different CRC cell lines. Overall, in seven out of
eleven CRC cell lines spinophilin was expressed at a lower
level compared to normal colon (Supplementary Figure
S1). This lower expression in CRC cell lines prompted us
to expand our analysis on in vivo data of CRC patients.
For evaluation of the prognostic relevance of spinophilin
expression in an external data set, we analyzed mRNA
expression data from the TCGA dataset. In 162 available
colon adenocarcinoma patients (Supplementary Table
S1), we found that a lower expression of spinophilin
is associated with poor patient survival (p = 0.038,
Kaplan Meier curve Figure 1A). In our study cohort, low
spinophilin expression levels did not significantly correlate
with patient age, gender, location, clinical stage, primary
tumor stage, distant metastases or microsatellite status
(all p-values >0.05, Supplementary Table S2). Univariate
analysis identified advanced clinical stage (stage I+II
versus III+IV) and low expression spinophilin expression
as poor prognostic factors for overall survival (all p-values

increase of cellular growth in spinophilin-silenced cells
over a 72 hours observational period (Figure 1B). To
substantiate these findings with a second independent
method, we monitored cellular growth rates by using
the xCELLigence system. This real-time growth assay
continuously detects the well impedance as a measure
of cell density. As shown in Figure 2A cellular growth
(indicated by the cell index on the Y-axis) increases in
cells with reduced spinophilin expression compared to
the control cells. We further characterized the influence
of spinophilin expression levels on well-established
features of cancer stem cells. Anchorage-independent
growth was assessed by soft agar colony formation assay.
A significantly higher number of colonies in spinophilinsilenced cells compared to control cells in HCT-116 cells
could be observed (p = 0.012, Wilcoxon test, Figure 2B).
To investigate whether differences of apoptotic activity
are responsible for the differently observed growth

rates and colony formation, we performed an annexin
staining using a flow cytometer. The shRNA scrambledcontrol cell line showed no increased proportion of this
apoptosis-related marker (Supplementary Figure S3A, B).
In addition, we measured the full length and cleaved PARP
protein expression by Western Blot (Supplementary Figure
S3C), the gene expression of the pro-apoptotic Bax gene
and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene, and the EMT-related
markers E-cadherin and vimentin, but could not detect
any significant differences (data not shown). To explore
possible molecular down-stream effects of spinophilinsilencing, we observed higher levels of E2F-1, a wellknown driving factor for cellular growth (Figure 2C).
Using a second cell line, the p53-mutated Caco-2 cell
line, we independently confirmed that lower spinophilin
expression levels are associated with increased cellular
growth rates and increased E2F-1 protein expression
(Figure 3A and 3B). For phosphorylated retinoblastoma

protein we received rather inconsistent findings with
regard to activation of this protein (data not shown). To
further clarify whether p53 mutation status influence
the behavior of CRC with varying levels of spinophilin
expression, we added a survival analysis in the 162
TCGA dataset patients by stratifying them into four
groups according to p53-mutational status and spinophilin
expression (details see also in the Material and Methods
section). However, we could not detect any influence of
p53 mutations when added to the spinophilin expression
levels on a better separation of survival curves (data not
shown). Next, we investigated the effect of spinophilinsilencing on self-renewal capacity using tumor sphere
assays and analyzed the expression of the CD133 surface
marker and proportion of the side population by FACS.
As the HCT116 cell line did not generate tumor spheres
in sufficient numbers to count and did not show any side
population in FACS analysis, we performed this step
with Caco-2 cells only. The number and size of primary
(Figure 3C) and secondary (Figure 3D) tumor spheres
were significantly higher in spinophilin-silenced cells

(p <0.05). We also observed a numerically increase of
CD133 positive cells in the whole cell population (14.97%
versus 8.23%) as well as in the sorted side population for
spinophilin-silenced cells (3.27% versus 2.17%, p<0.05).
Detailed scatterplot images of the different subpopulations
are shown in Figure 4A-F. Consequently, exposing these
cells to different concentrations of 5-FU for 48 hours, we
observed a higher resistance to 5-FU in the spinophilinsilenced cells. Figure 5 shows the dose-response curves
and corresponding IC50 values. In order to evaluate some
molecular causes for the different spinophilin expression
levels in tumor tissue, we analyzed the TCGA dataset with
regard to copy number changes in the spinophilin gene
region. For this purpose, we downloaded copy number
information from the cBioportal for cancer genomics as
well as copy number data as generated by the GISTIC
algorithm. This algorithm attempts to identify significantly
altered regions of amplification or deletion across sets of
patients. It generates putative gene/patient copy number
specific calls: “-2” is a deep loss, possibly a homozygous
deletion, “-1” is a single-copy loss (heterozygous

cells (green line) could also be detected in the Caco-2 cell line and (B) increased E2F-1 protein expression. (C-D) A significant increase in

deletion), “0” is diploid, “1” indicates a low-level gain,
and “2” is a high-level amplification. Of the 155 patients
with all available data in our cohort (copy number changes
and expression values), 22 (14.2%) had “-1” (i.e. singlecopy loss) and 28 (18.1%) had “+1” (i.e. low-level gain).
Interestingly, we could see a direct correlation with regard
to spinophilin expression/copy numbers in tumor samples
(R = 0.38, p<0.001, Supplementary Figure S4).
Finally, in order to determine whether epigenetic
changes influence spinophilin expression in CRC, we
treated the HCT116, RKO, Colo320 and Colo201 cell
lines with the de-methylation agent 5-aza-dC and the
histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A(TSA). After
treatment with these agents a significant up-regulation of
spinophilin in these cell lines at a varying extent (up to
4 fold) was observed after 15µM 5-aza-dC or combined
TSA treatment but not after TSA only treatment (Figure 6).
To explore the role of different levels of CpG methylation
in the promoter region of spinophilin in vivo, we utilized
bioinformatic tools to retrieve data for 19 CpGs sites in
a CpG island in the promoter region of the spinophilin
gene (Position: chr17:48226224-48228625, Band:
17q21.33, Genomic Size: 2402 bp, Supplementary Figure
S5A). We used data generated by an Illumina Infinium
Methylation450 platform derived from the TCGA data set.
We obtained methylation data of 31 patients out of the 162
in our cohort. In these patients, we found for at least two
CpGs in this region a significantly negative correlation

between spinophilin expression and DNA methylation
extent (Supplementary Figure S5B-C).

DISCUSSION
Tremendous efforts have been spent on the
exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms in
tumor progression and metastases of CRC. This initiative
has led to the discovery of some key molecules and
pathways including the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) in tumor angiogenesis and the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) with the therapy guiding
KRAS/NRAS mutations. These and other molecules highly
impacted the clinical practice of CRC treatment [14,
15]. Nevertheless, due to the moderate survival rates of
metastatic CRC, the race for identifying novel factors,
whether useful as drug targets, prognostic markers or
diagnostics, is still ongoing [16-19]. In this study, we report
about the role of spinophilin, a previously recognized
novel tumor suppressor gene, in CRC. First, we found
using the internationally established TCGA dataset that
low spinophilin levels are associated with poor survival
in uni- as well as multivariate analyses. These findings
match well with the previous report about spinophilin
in CRC, where Estevez-Garcia and colleagues proposed
a negative influence on survival and relapse-free time
especially in stage III CRC patients treated with adjuvant
fluoropyrimidine therapy [11]. In this well-designed

study, the authors also report about lower response rates
to therapy in patients with low spinophilin expression.
In addition, using CRC cell lines (Colo205, HT29,
SW480) with different p53 mutational status (wild-type
or mutated), which were different from the ones we used
in our study, they also observed an increased growth in
spinophilin-silenced cells in soft agar assays. A clinical or
experimental observation holds true and gets substantiated
when independent models and groups confirm the results
[12, 13]. Therefore, the findings in our study confirm that
low spinophilin expression is associated with poor survival
and, by using different cellular growth assays and cell
lines, a loss of this protein drives cellular growth in CRC
independent of the p53 mutational status. In our study, we
further demonstrated that reduction of spinophilin leads
to an increase of the transcription factor E2F-1. This
mechanism of action seems to be similar as previously
reported by Ferrer et al. [9]. The higher proliferative state
of tumors with low spinophilin expression might be one
explanation for the poor clinical outcome in this group of
patients. However, in a further attempt to characterize the

cellular mode of action, we also identified that spinophilinsilenced cells are prone to form more tumor spheres
under ultra-low attachment conditions than control cells.

by the histon-deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Treatment with the histon-deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A alone had no effect on
spinophilin expression.

Furthermore, a higher number of CD133 positive cells
in the whole population as well as in the side population
could be identified. Both of these features, tumor sphere
formation and CD133 positive cells/side population have
been previously described as cancer stem cell features
in CRC [20]. In our study, we also found a significant
correlation between copy number changes and the levels
of spinophilin expression. Estevez-Garcia and colleagues
hypothesized in their study that spinophilin might
increase the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents [11].
In line with this notion, we detected higher growth rates
of 5-FU treated cells in the spinophilin-silenced cells,
which support this hypothesis. Interestingly, we also
observed an up-regulation of spinophilin in CRC cells
after treatment of the DNA-demethylation agent 5-azadC. Estevez-Garcia et al. detected no DNA methylation
in the promoter region of spinophilin gene. However,
they used methylation-specific PCR, which only covers
a limited number of CpG sites and is a rather qualitative
method for DNA-methylation detection. In our study, we
used genome-wide methylation data and found for at least
two CpG sites a negative correlation between extent of
methylation and spinophilin expression. According to
our data, either the region of the promoter or some other
enhancer regions of the spinophilin gene are affected
by DNA methylation, which in turn can influence the
expression level of this tumor suppressor in tumors.
Another explanation for our observation might be an
indirect effect of other trans-acting transcription factors
that are activated by the DNA-demethylating agent and
thus increase the transcription of the spinophilin locus.
Clinically, this relationship of low spinophilin levels and
aggressive behavior may be circumvented by restoration
of spinophilin expression or, even easier to perform, the
inhibition of down-stream affected factors like E2F-1 [21].
However, further research to decipher additional modes of
action and pre-clinical trials are necessary before the true
value of spinophilin-targeting in clinical practice can be
estimated.
In summary, we confirmed the previously identified
association of low spinophilin expression and poor
prognosis in CRC patients. In addition, we found that
spinophilin might be involved in cancer stem cells, that
the E2F-1 signaling is positively influenced and that
DNA methylation in CRC cells might explain in part the
differential expression of spinophilin in CRC.

Genome Atlas Project (TCGA; http://tcga-data.nci.nih.
gov/) for CRC patients [22]. For 162 patients with colon
adenocarcinoma (COAD), we acquired from TCGA portal
mRNA expression (level 3 RNASeq v2 GA) and clinical
information. The clinical information was completed
from the previously published study [22]. For 151
patients among them, we obtained p53 somatic mutation
information from same study [22]. Analyses were carried
out in R statistical environment (version 3.0.1) (http:///
www.r-project.org/). All tests were two-sided and
considered statistical significant at the 0.05 level. For
prognostic studies, we checked for a relationship between
spinophilin mRNA expression and overall survival as
follows: Patients were grouped into percentiles according
to mRNA expression. The log-rank test was employed
to determine the association between mRNA expression
and overall survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to generate overall survival curves. The cut-off to
optimally separate the patients into low/high groups
(log-rank test p-value minimum) was chosen. The cutoff value to optimally separate the patients in this cohort
was determined at 0.34 (where 1 means 100% of the
cohort). Based on the previous description that a loss of
spinophilin led to tumor progression especially in a p53mutated genotype [9], we considered whether adding p53
mutation status added information to the prognostic value.
For this purpose, we did this by letting the spinophilin cutoff level to vary between 0.25 and 0.75 and recording for
each patient p53 mutation status. This splits the cohort
in four groups corresponding to low/high spinophilin
expression and mutated/wild-type p53 status. The logrank test was again employed to determine the association
between spinophilin mRNA expression/p53 status and
overall survival.
For testing the CpG methylation status of CpGs in a
CpG island in the promoter region of the spinophilin gene
(position: chr17:48226224-48228625, Band: 17q21.33,
Genomic Size: 2402 bp) we used data generated by an
Illumina platform (Infinium Methylation450 platform)
derived from the TCGA data set. We obtained methylation
data of 31 patients out of the 162 in our cohort for 19
CpG sites. The reason for the limited number of patients
was that methylation profiling in the TCGA dataset was
performed for some patients on an Infinium Methylation27
platform and for some patients ( n = 31) on an Infinium
Methylation450 platform. Unfortunately, the Infinium
Methylation27 package does not have a comprehensive
coverage as the Infinium Methylation450 and the
spinophilin promoter region was not targeted on the
Infinium Methylation 27 platform. For quantifying the
methylation levels, the analysis resulted in beta-values.
A beta-value is generated by Illumina´s technology. Beta
values for each interrogated CpG locus are calculated as
Beta = M/(M+U)+100, whereby M and U represent the
mean signal intensities for replicate methylated (M) and
unmethylated (U) probes on the array. Beta can take a

RT-PCR was carried out in triplicates for each sample
using commercially available primers specific for
spinophilin (Hs_PPP1R9B_1_SG QuantiTect primer
assay, Qiagen), EMT-related genes (E-cadherin, Hs_

using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen). The
geometric mean of the housekeeping genes GAPDH
and B2M was used for normalization and relative gene
expression levels were calculated according to the 2-ΔΔCT
method.

Cell culture
The human CRC cell lines Caco-2 and HCT-116,
which are extensively used in this study, were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
CA, USA) and their origin was proven by DNA identity
STR-analysis. Caco-2 cells were grown in MEM with
Earle’s Salts and L-Glutamine. For HCT-116 McCoy’s
5A modified Medium (w/o L-Glutamine, 2,2g/L sodium
bicarbonate) was used. Growth medium contained 10%
foetal bovine serum gold (PAA Laboratories, Pasching,
Austria) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin).
Cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere
at 37°C. All other CRC cell lines (SW480, RKO, DLD1, Colo205, Colo201, LS174, Colo320, SW620, HT29)
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
or other commercially suppliers and were grown under
the recommended standard conditions. For comparison
of spinophilin mRNA expression in these cell lines to
normal human colon, we used Human Colon Total RNA
(Clontech, catalog no. 636553).

Proteins were separated by a 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN®
TGX™Precast Gel (Biorad, Hercules, CA) and transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Applichem, St. Louis,
MO). The membrane was blocked for one hour with 3%
non-fat dry milk in Tris buffered Saline/0.1% Tween-20.
Immunoblotting was performed and antibodies specific for
spinophilin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, diluted 1:1000
in 1% non-fat dry milk in Tris buffered Saline/0.1%

HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies,
respectively (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Visualization
was performed using an enhanced chemoluminescence

ShRNA lentiviral particles transduction
Caco-2 and HCT-116 cells were seeded in 6-well
plates 24 hours prior to viral infection and incubated
overnight in 2 ml of complete growth medium
containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics. On the day
of transfection the medium was removed and 2 ml of
complete growth medium containing 8 µg/ml polybrene
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and 10 µl
of ViralPlus Transduction Enhancer (ABM, Richmond,
BC, Canada) were added. Cells were infected by
adding 50 µl of shRNA spinophilin (Sense strand:
5’-GGGAGGUGCGCAAGAUUAATT-3’, Antisense
strand:
5’-UUAAUCUUGCGCACCUCCCGG-3’)
lentiviral particles (ABM) or shRNA scrambled control
lentiviral particles (ABM), respectively. Stably transfected
Caco-2 cells were selected with 7.5 µg/ml puromycin
dihydrochloride (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) and HCT-116
cells were selected by adding 0.5 µg/ml puromycin
dihydrochloride.

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of spinophilin
expression level
For detection of spinophilin expression from all
cell lines described in this study, RNA was extracted by
using a Trizol standard extraction protocol and 1 µg of
total RNA was reverse transcribed by the QuantiTect

WST-1 proliferation assay and 5-flourouracil
resistance assay

µl SYTO ® 24 Green Fluorescent Nucleic Acid Stain
(Molecular Probes) incubated at room temperature for 5
min in the dark. Flow cytometry analyses of HCT-116 cells
were performed with FACS LSRII (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, US). 10000 events were collected and identified in
the side and forward scatter with linear scale. Fluorescence
signal was analyzed with logarithmic scale, analyses were
done with FACS Diva software (BD), graphical analyses
were performed in FCS express (De Novo Software, Los
Angeles, US).
To identify the side population and non-side
population fractions, cells were trypsinized and suspended
at 1x106 cells/ml in culture medium containing 2% FBS.
Hoechst 33342 dye (Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) was
added at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in the presence
or absence of 100 μM verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich), and the
cells were incubated at 37˚C for 120 min with intermittent
shaking every 15 min. The cells were then stained with
2.5 µl CD133-APC antibody (Milteny Biotec, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany) and incubated in the dark for 30
min on ice. The cells were washed twice with PBS and
resuspended in 250 µl PBS with 2 µg/ml Propidium iodide
(PI) and kept on ice until FACS analysis. Cell analyses
were carried out using FACS LSRII (BD). Hoechst
33342 dye was excited by a 350-nm ultraviolet laser, and
fluorescence emission was dual wavelength analyzed
(Hoechst blue 440/40; Hoechst Red 695/40). In general,
cells in a side population have distinguishing biological
characteristics, commonly indicated by the ability to efflux
chemotherapy drugs or other marker molecules (Hoechst
33342). This side population is therefore also regarded
as a distinct population of cells, commonly enriched by
cells with cancer stem cell features (which includes by
definition a higher degree of chemoresistance).

To test whether altered spinophilin expression
influences cellular growth rates of CRC cells, we applied
the WST-1 proliferation assay (Roche Applied Science,
Mannheim, Germany). In more detail, after standard
trypsinization 2x104 HCT-116 cells (shRNA spinophilin
and shRNA scrambled control) per well were seeded
in a 96-well culture plate. The cells were incubated in
normal McCoy`s 5A modified Medium growth medium
(Biochrom, Berlin Germany) for 48 hours and the WST-1
proliferation reagent (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim
Germany) was applied according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. After four hours the colorimetric
changes were measured using a SpectraMax Plus
(Molecular Devices, CA, US) at a wavelength of 450 nm
with a reference wavelength at 620 nm. Three independent
experiments in six technical replicates were performed.
The same assay was used for testing the resistance of
Caco2 cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In detail, 24 hours
after seeding the spinophilin-silenced and control cells to
wells of a 96-well plate, eight different two-fold diluted
concentrations of 5-FU including one untreated control
were added to the cells (in the range of physiological
levels between 0.625 to 40 µM). After 48 hours, the WST1 assay was applied and the optical density compared to
the untreated cells was calculated. Dose-response curves
and IC50 values were calculated by using the software
tools of Prism GraphPad software version 6.0.

xCELLigence cellular growth assay
A second independent cellular growth assay was
used to substantiate the findings of the WST-1 assay.
Labeling-free cell-based assay system (xCELLigence
system, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim Germany) was
used for real-time analysis of cellular growth of HCT-116
and Caco-2 shRNA transfected and control cells. 1x104
HCT-116 cells and 2x104 Caco-2 cells were seeded in
electronic microtiter plates (E-Plate™; Roche Diagnostic,
Mannheim, Germany) and measured for 66 h with the
xCELLigence system according to the instructions in the
user’s manual. Cell density measurements were performed
three times in triplicates with a programmed signal
detection every 15 min. Data acquisition and analyses
were performed with the RTCA software (version 1.2,
Roche Diagnostics).

5-aza-dC and trichostatin A treatment to explore
epigenetic effects
To evaluate whether spinophilin is directly or
indirectly regulated by DNA-hypermethylation or histonacetylation we treated HCT-116, RKO, Colo320 and
Colo201 CRC cells with modifiers of these epigenetic
changes. De-methylation was induced with 5-aza-dC
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Lois, US) treatment at different
concentrations, which were previously proven to induce
maximal de-methylation of the DNA without killing the
cells. 100000 cells per well were seeded in 6-well culture
dishes and 24 hours later the drug treatment was started.
Culture media for HCT-116 and RKO cells contained 1
μM or 15 μM 5-aza-dC. Cells were incubated for 96 hours
with 5-aza-dC with the culture media being replaced every
24 hours with fresh media containing 5-aza-dC. RNA was
extracted after 96 hours of drug treatment. The experiment
was also performed with cells continuously exposed to 40
nM trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma-Aldrich) without 5-aza-dC

Apoptosis, CD133 staining and side population
106 cells/ml were resuspended in 1x binding buffer
(BioLegend, London, UK). 100 µl cell suspension was
stained with 5µl AnnexinV-APC (BioLegend) and 10

and as an add-on combinatorial treatment after 72 hours of
15 μM 5-aza-dC to assess the effect of histone acetylation
on DNA re-methylation. This chosen concentration has
previously been shown to cause hyper-acetylation in HCT116 cell line [23].

date of diagnosis to the date of death of any cause. Cox
proportional hazard models were performed using SPSS
version 19.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Univariate Cox proportional hazards models including
age, gender, tumor stage, microsatellite status, location
and spinophilin expression were used to determine the
clinico-pathological parameters that were statistically
significant for OS. The reported results included hazard
ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Anchorage-independent growth
The efficiency of colony formation of stably
transfected CRC cells in soft agar was determined by
plating 2500 cells in 1 ml of complete growth medium
containing 0.35% low gelling temperature agarose
(Sigma-Aldrich, Seelze, Germany) over 1.5 ml of growth
medium containing 0.5% agar (Sigma) in a 35mm dish.
Cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 for up to four
weeks. Colonies were stained with 0.005% crystal violet
(Sigma) in 25% methanol and the number of colonies was
counted using a dissecting microscope.

Colon sphere formation assay
To assess colon sphere formation, we performed
a spheroid growth model as previously described with
slight modifications [24]. In detail, the adherent growing
CRC cell lines were dissociated into single cells using
trypsin/EDTA and seeded in ultra-low attachment 6-well
plates (Corning, NY, USA) in serum-free medium (SFM).
Caco-2 colon spheres were seeded in SFM MEM with
Earle’s salts containing 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (PAA),
supplemented with 1xB27 supplement (Gibco), 20 ng/ml
human epidermal growth factor EGF (PeproTech), 20 ng/
ml human basic fibroblast growth factor FGF (PeproTech),
2 mM sodium pyruvate (PAA), 1% non-essential amino
acids (PAA), 4IU/l insulin actrapid (Novo Nordisk) and
1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich).
Primary colon spheres were counted under a microscope
ten days after seeding single cells. A sphere formation
assay of secondary spheres was done by using primary
spheres. Briefly, primary spheres were dissociated into
single cells using TrypLE Select (Gibco, Invitrogen
Life Technologies). Single-cell suspensions of colon
spheres were seeded at 2.000 cells per well in SFM plus
supplements. Ten days after seeding secondary spheres
were counted. Three independent experiments with each
three technical replicates were performed.
