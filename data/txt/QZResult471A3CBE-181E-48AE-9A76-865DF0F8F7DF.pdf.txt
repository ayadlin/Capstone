Abstract:

Recent clinical evidence revealed that the use of beta-blockers such as propranolol,
prior to diagnosis or concurrently with chemotherapy, could increase relapse-free and
overall survival in breast cancer patients. We therefore hypothesized that propranolol
may be able to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy either through direct effects on
cancer cells or via anti-angiogenic mechanisms. In vitro proliferation assay showed
that propranolol (from 50-100 μM) induces dose-dependent anti-proliferative effects
in a panel of 9 human cancer and “normal” cell lines. Matrigel assays revealed that
propranolol displays potent anti-angiogenic properties at non-toxic concentrations
(<50 μM) but exert no vascular-disrupting activity. Combining chemotherapeutic
drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or paclitaxel, with propranolol at the lowest
effective concentration resulted in synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects on
cell proliferation in vitro depending on the cell type and the dose of chemotherapy
used. Interestingly, breast cancer and vascular endothelial cells were among the most
responsive to these combinations. Furthermore, Matrigel assays indicated that low
concentrations of propranolol (10 – 50 μM) potentiated the anti-angiogenic effects
of 5-FU and paclitaxel. Using an orthotopic xenograft model of triple-negative breast
cancer, based on injection of luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells in the mammary
fat pad of nude mice, we showed that propranolol, when used alone, induced only
transient anti-tumor effects, if at all, and did not increase median survival. However,
the combination of propranolol with chemotherapy resulted in more profound and
sustained anti-tumor effects and significantly increased the survival benefits induced
by chemotherapy alone (+19% and +79% in median survival for the combination as
compared with 5-FU alone and paclitaxel alone, respectively; p<0.05). Collectively
our results show that propranolol can potentiate the anti-angiogenic effects and antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy. The current study, together with retrospective clinical
data, strongly suggests that the use of propranolol concurrently with chemotherapy
may improve the outcome of breast cancer patients, thus providing a strong
rationale for the evaluation of this drug combination in prospective clinical studies.

INTRODUCTION

antagonists alone. Here, we hypothesized for the first
time that β-AR antagonists, and propranolol in particular,
may be able to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy by
potentiating the anti-proliferative and/or anti-angiogenic
effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. We thus proposed
to investigate the combination of propranolol and
chemotherapy on cell proliferation and angiogenesis in
vitro and on tumor growth inhibition and survival in vivo
using an orthotopic model of triple-negative breast cancer.

The costs associated with drug development are
rising so dramatically that cheaper, faster and more
effective strategies to identify new compounds and
implement them successfully in the clinic are desperately
needed [1]. In the current financial and economical
context, drug repositioning, which consists of using
already approved drugs for new medical indications, is
gaining increasing interest as an alternative strategy for
drug development [2-4]. By using drugs with well-known
toxicity and pharmacokinetics profiles, this strategy can
remove several years, substantial risks and costs from the
pathway to the clinic. For instance, the recent discovery of
the efficacy of propranolol -a non-selective β-adrenergic
receptor (β-AR) antagonist commonly used for the
treatment of hypertension- in treating severe infantile
haemangioma has revolutionized the management of this
pathology in 2 years [5, 6]. Although the first evidence
for a role of β-ARs in cancer progression was provided
more than 20 years ago [7], the serendipitous observation
of the efficacy of propranolol in treating haemangiomas
has renewed interest in exploring the anti-angiogenic and
anti-cancer properties of β-AR antagonists (also called
β-blockers).
A number of in vitro studies have demonstrated the
anti-proliferative, anti-migratory and cytotoxic properties
of propranolol, particularly against lung adenocarcinoma
[7, 8], colon carcinoma [9], breast carcinoma [10],
nasopharyngeal carcinoma [11], ovarian cancer [12],
pancreatic cancer [13-15] and gastric cancer cells
[16]. Propranolol was also found to exert potent antiangiogenic effects in vitro through direct mechanisms
on vascular endothelial cells [17, 18] and by decreasing
pro-angiogenic signaling in both stromal [19] and cancer
cells [11, 20-23]. Some of these promising anti-cancer
properties have been confirmed in vivo using different
animal models of human cancers. Propranolol was thus
found to exert potent cancer preventive effects in models
of chemically-induced lung and pancreatic cancers [24,
25]. Furthermore, innovative pre-clinical models of breast
and ovarian cancer showed that propranolol was able
to specifically inhibit stress-induced tumor growth and
metastatic spread through anti-angiogenic and immunostimulatory mechanisms [26, 27].
Over the past 12 months, emerging clinical data
have further strengthened the potential benefits of
β-AR antagonists in cancer patients [28, 29]. Three
retrospective clinical studies revealed that the use of β-AR
antagonists, prior to diagnosis and/or concomitantly with
chemotherapy, was associated with increased survival
and/or decreased metastatic spread and incidence of tumor
recurrence in breast cancer patients [30-32]. Different
molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain such
benefits of β-AR antagonists in breast cancer patients [28,
29], focusing on the anti-metastatic properties of β-AR

Propranolol potentiates the anti-proliferative
effects of chemotherapy in a cell type-specific and
dose-dependent manner
Drug
combination
studies
using
growth
inhibition assay were performed to determine whether
propranolol can potentiate the anti-proliferative effects
of chemotherapeutic drugs. The lowest effective
concentration of propranolol (IC10-IC15) was combined
with a range of concentrations of the pyrimidine analog
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and the microtubule-stabilizing
agent paclitaxel in the panel of 9 human cell lines. After
72h drug incubation, cell proliferation was measured by
Alamar Blue or MTT and combination index (CI) values
were calculated for all tested drug concentrations based
on the Chou and Talalay method [33, 34]. The CI theorem
provides quantitative definition for additive effects (CI =
1), synergisms (CI<1) and antagonisms (CI>1) in drug
combinations. The combination of propranolol with
5-FU resulted in a synergistic, additive or antagonistic
interaction depending on the dose of 5-FU used and the
cell type (Figure 3A and Table 1). In all 3 breast cancer cell
lines and HMEC-1 endothelial cells, this drug combination
resulted in a slight antagonism at 1 μM 5-FU but the
interaction became additive or synergistic with increasing
concentrations of 5-FU. In BMH29L endothelial cells, the
interaction between propranolol and 5-FU was synergistic
at all tested concentrations. In contrast, an antagonistic
effect was observed at all tested concentrations in HBL100 breast epithelial cells. Interestingly, in other types
of cancer cell lines (i.e. A549, SK-N-SH and U87), the
combination of propranolol and 5-FU mostly resulted in
an antagonism (Table 1).
Cell type-specific and dose-dependent effects were
also observed when combining propranolol and paclitaxel
(Figure 3B and Table 1). In contrast with the previous
drug combination, diverse effects were observed in the

3 different breast cancer cell lines. In MCF-7 cells, the
combination of propranolol and paclitaxel resulted in a
slight antagonism at 1 nM paclitaxel but it became highly
synergistic with increasing paclitaxel concentrations.
In contrast, this drug combination led to a sub-additive
effect at all tested concentrations in MDA-MB-231
cells and changed from additivity to antagonism with
increasing paclitaxel concentrations in SKBR3 cells.
In BMH29L cells, the combination of propranolol with
paclitaxel led to a synergistic effect irrespectively of the
dose of paclitaxel used whereas in HMEC-1 cells, this
combination was sub-additive, additive and synergistic at
5, 10 and 25nM paclitaxel, respectively. Finally, mixed

results were also obtained with the other cancer cell lines
(Table 1). In A549, the interaction between paclitaxel
and propranolol changed from synergism to antagonism
with increasing paclitaxel concentration whereas this
drug combination was synergistic and antagonistic at all
tested drug concentrations in SK-N-SH and U87 cells,
respectively. Propranolol thus appeared to modulate the
anti-proliferative effects of chemotherapy in vitro in a cell
type-specific and dose-dependent manner.

increase in the anti-angiogenic effects of paclitaxel when
used in combination with propranolol (supplementary
videos 1-4). As compared to treatment with either
drug alone, treatment with the combination resulted in
incomplete morphological differentiation of endothelial
cells into vascular structures, followed by regression

to 56 days for mice treated with the combination. Our
results thus demonstrate that propranolol can enhance the
efficacy of chemotherapy in a mouse orthotopic model of
human triple-negative breast cancer.

DISCUSSION
Accumulating clinical evidence suggests that
beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists and propranolol in
particular may lead to increased survival and decreased
recurrence in breast cancer patients [30-32]. Here, we
provide the first evidence that propranolol can increase
the efficacy of chemotherapy, either through direct effects
on tumor angiogenesis and/or by potentiating the antiangiogenic and anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic
drugs.
Our study first demonstrated that propranolol has
relatively modest anti-proliferative properties in vitro
against a panel of 9 human cell lines. High concentrations
of propranolol were required to significantly inhibit cell
proliferation, with IC50 values ranging from 100 μM to >250
μM across the panel of cell lines. Early pharmacokinetics
studies revealed that clinically relevant concentrations
of propranolol are in the low μM range [35, 36], thus
suggesting that propranolol alone is not likely to inhibit
cell proliferation in vivo. The sensitivity to propranolol
was cell type specific but did not depend on the tissue of
origin, since all 4 cell lines of breast tissue origin displayed
different levels of sensitivity. Interestingly, MCF-7 breast
cancer cells were twice as much sensitive to propranolol
than MDA-MB-231 cells, although the former have been
reported to express low levels of β-ARs as compared to the
latter [37]. This suggests that the level of β-AR expression
may not directly influence cell sensitivity to the antiproliferative effect of propranolol. In contrast with its
modest effects on cell proliferation, propranolol was able
to significantly inhibit angiogenesis in vitro at relatively
low concentrations (from 10 and 20 μM in BMH29L
and HMEC-1 cells, respectively). These results were
consistent with those previously reported with other types
of vascular endothelial cells (i.e. HUVEC and HMVEC)
[18] and confirmed the potent anti-angiogenic activity of
propranolol. The current study further showed that unlike
microtubule-depolymerizing agents [38], propranolol has
almost no vascular-disrupting activity in addition to its
anti-angiogenic properties. This result indicates that the
anti-vascular properties of propranolol reported in various
pre-clinical and clinical studies [5, 26, 27] are mostly due
to the inhibition of new capillary tube formation rather
than the disruption of pre-existing vessels.
Our in vitro combination studies revealed that
low concentrations of propranolol can modulate the
anti-proliferative effects of chemotherapeutic drugs in
vitro in a cell type-specific and dose-dependent manner.
Interestingly, human breast carcinoma and vascular
endothelial cell lines were among the most responsive

Propranolol increases the efficacy of chemotherapy
in a mouse orthotopic model of human triplenegative breast cancer
To investigate the effect of combining propranolol
with chemotherapy on tumor growth and survival in vivo,
a mouse orthotopic model of human triple-negative breast
cancer was used and the combination of propranolol
and paclitaxel was evaluated. Treatment consisted of i.p
injections of paclitaxel alone (20 mg/kg, 3 days a week
for 3 weeks), propranolol alone (10 mg/kg, 5 days a week
for 5 weeks) or the combination of both drugs. All three
treatments were well tolerated as evidenced by an absence
of weight loss or change in animal well-being as compared
with vehicle-only treated mice (data not shown). Weekly
bioluminescence measurements showed that propranolol
alone did not significantly delay tumor growth, whereas
treatment with paclitaxel alone or in combination with
propranolol considerably inhibited tumor progression
(Figure 6A-B). The addition of propranolol to paclitaxel
did not significantly increase the very potent anti-tumor
effects induced by paclitaxel alone (Figure 6A-B and
supplementary Figure 5). It did however induce significant
survival benefits as compared to paclitaxel alone (Figure
6C and Table 2). Median survival was thus increased from
70 days in animals treated with paclitaxel alone to 125
days in animals receiving the combination of propranolol
and paclitaxel. Furthermore, at study completion (150
days after start of treatment), 12.5% (1/8) and 25% (2/8) of
mice were tumor-free in the cohorts of animals receiving
paclitaxel alone and the combination of propranolol and
paclitaxel, respectively.
Similar results were obtained when combining
propranolol and 5-FU in vivo (supplementary Figure 6
and Table 2). The addition of propranolol to 5-FU did
not significantly increase the anti-tumor effects induced
by 5-FU alone, except at week 4 of treatment (p<0.05).
However, this combination appeared to be the most
effective treatment regimen in terms of survival benefits.
Indeed, it led to a substantial increase in median survival
from 44 days for both vehicle-treated and propranololtreated mice and 47 days for mice treated with 5-FU alone

Figure 6: In vitro drug combination study of propranolol and paclitaxel. NMRI nude mice were injected with luciferase-

expressing MDA-MB-231 cells into the mammary fat pad and randomized into 4 groups following confirmation of engraftment. Treatment
was initiated 3 weeks after tumor cell injection and consisted of i.p injection of saline 5 days a week for up to 5 weeks, 10 mg/kg
propranolol alone 5 days a week for 5 weeks, 20 mg/kg paclitaxel alone 3 days a week for 3 weeks or the combination of propranolol
and paclitaxel. A) Representative pictures of bioluminescence measurements performed 1 week (top panel), 3 weeks (middle panel) and
7 weeks (bottom panel) after treatment was initiated. The color scale indicates the signal intensity, which is directly proportional to the
number of tumor cells. Pictures taken at 6 different wavelengths (i.e.,580 to 630 nm) were next combined for 3D reconstruction and tumor
size evaluation. B) Quantitative analysis of tumor growth by weekly measurements of luciferase activity in mice treated with saline only

to the combination of propranolol and chemotherapy.
Consistent with our results, a recent study has shown
that the combination of radiotherapy with propranolol
in gastric cancer cells in vitro led to an increase in
radiotherapy-induced apoptosis [39]. Elsewhere, β-AR
agonists such as epinephrine have been previously
reported to induce resistance to paclitaxel in MCF7 breast cancer cells [40] and to 5-FU in HT-29 colon
cancer cells [41] through up-regulation of the ABCB1
gene. However, these two studies also showed that
propranolol was unable to prevent epinephrine-induced
overexpression of ABCB1 and its product P-glycoprotein.
This not only suggests that the potentiation of the antiproliferative effects of 5-FU and paclitaxel by propranolol
reported in the current study is independent from ABCB1
up-regulation but also reveals that additional mechanisms,
yet to be discovered, are involved in the regulation of
drug sensitivity by β-AR signaling. Based on the high
sensitivity of vascular endothelial cells to propranolol, we
hypothesized that propranolol may also potentiate the antiangiogenic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. Our finding
that combining low concentrations of propranolol with
5-FU or paclitaxel significantly increases angiogenesis
inhibition in vitro, demonstrates for the first time that
propranolol can potentiate the anti-angiogenic properties
of chemotherapeutic drugs through direct effects on
endothelial cells. Additional experiments are currently
underway to unravel the mechanisms involved in the
synergism between propranolol and chemotherapeutic
drugs against cell proliferation and angiogenesis in
vitro. A number of candidates are being considered.
These include cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) and Src
kinase signaling pathways, which are both involved in
the adrenergic regulation of cancer cell proliferation and
invasion, as well as the inhibition of VEGF receptor-2
tyrosine phosphorylation and MMP-9 secretion, which
have been shown to mediate the anti-angiogenic effects of
propranolol in vitro [17, 18, 42, 43].
Triple-negative breast cancer is estimated to
affect more than 170,000 women worldwide each year
and associated with a poor prognosis [44]. Effective
therapeutic options are very limited but β-AR antagonists
have been recently found to be particularly beneficial
in triple-negative breast cancer patients [32]. The
potentiation of the anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic
effects of chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro demonstrated
in the current study provides two potential mechanisms
by which propranolol may be able to increase the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo. Previous studies
have found that propranolol could inhibit the development
of stress-induced metastasis in preclinical models of both
ovarian and breast cancer but it only affected primary
tumor growth in the ovarian cancer model [26, 27]. Here
we found that propranolol alone induced only minor and
transient anti-tumor effects in a mouse orthotopic model
of breast cancer and it did not lead to survival benefits.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

This result, together with those previously reported in the
literature, suggest that the anti-tumor effects of propranolol
are most likely to occur in small disseminated tumors
but not in larger, bulky tumors, which is consistent with
the potent anti-angiogenic but weak vascular-disrupting
properties of propranolol reported here. Nevertheless, our
study further showed that, in absence of chronic stress,
propranolol can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy
in vivo. Although the difference did not reach statistical
significance, there was a clear trend towards a more potent
anti-tumor effect when propranolol was combined with
chemotherapy, as compared with chemotherapy alone.
Furthermore, combining propranolol to chemotherapy
resulted in improved survival in two independent in
vivo studies. The addition of propranolol thus increased
the median survival by 79% and 19% as compared to
paclitaxel alone and 5-FU alone, respectively.
Collectively, our results indicate that propranolol
could potentially be used concomitantly with
chemotherapy in breast cancer patients to increase
treatment efficacy. The evaluation of such combination
therapy in prospective clinical trials is urgently needed,
particularly in triple-negative breast cancer patients for
whom effective therapeutic options are extremely limited.
If successful, this clinical translation could rapidly impact
on the treatment of more than 1 million women worldwide
affected by breast cancer each year, thus further illustrating
the numerous advantages of drug repositioning in terms of
time- and cost-saving. Finally, it is also important to note
that β-AR antagonists could also be beneficial in other
types of drug-refractory solid tumors and warrants further
investigation in clinically-relevant models of both adult
and childhood cancers.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Reagents
Propranolol (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, Australia)
was resuspended in water and stock solutions (50
mM) were stored at 4°C. Commercial solutions of
5-fluorouracil in saline were obtained from La Timone
University Hospital of Marseille, France and Hospira
Australia (Mulgrave North, Australia) and stored at room
temperature. Paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich) was resuspended
in DMSO and stock solutions (2 mM) were stored at
-20°C.

Cell culture
The breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and glioblastoma
cell line U87 were maintained in DMEM medium

line A549 and neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen), the breast
cancer cell line SKBR3 was maintained in McCoy’5A
medium (Invitrogen) and the breast epithelial cell line
HBL-100 was maintained in MEM (Invitrogen). All
these culture media were supplemented with 10% Fetal
Calf Serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin
streptomycin. The microvascular endothelial cell line
HMEC-1 was grown on 0.1% gelatin-coated flasks using
MCDB-131 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS, 2
mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, 1 μg/
mL hydrocortisone and 10 ng/mL epithelial growth factor
(BioScientific, Gymea, Australia). BMH29L cells are bone
marrow derived endothelial cells that were immortalized
by ectopic expression of human telomerase reverse
transcriptase [45]. They were kindly provided by Dr
Karen MacKenzie (Children’s Cancer Institute Australia)
and grown on 0.1% gelatin-coated flasks using Medium
199 (Invitrogen) containing 20% FCS, 5% AB-only
male human serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% penicillin and
streptomycin, 1% heparin, 5 ng/mL recombinant human
FGFβ (fibroblast growth factor β; Sigma-Aldrich) and
20 μg/mL Endothelial Cell Growth Factor (Roche, Dee
Why, Australia). All cell lines were routinely maintained
in culture at 37°C and 5% CO2 and regularly screened to
ensure the absence of mycoplasma contamination.

In vitro MatrigelTM assay
The MatrigelTM (BD Biosciences, North Ryde,
Australia) assay was used to determine the anti-angiogenic
and vascular-disrupting properties of propranolol alone
or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, as
previously described [38]. Briefly, 24-well plates were
coated at 4°C with 270μL of a MatrigelTM solution (1:1
dilution in cell culture medium), which was then allowed
to solidify for 1 h at 37°C before cell seeding. For the
anti-angiogenesis assay, endothelial cells were treated
with different drug solutions 20 min after seeding on
MatrigelTM and photographs were taken after 8h drug
incubation using the 5X objective of an Axiovert 200M
fluorescent microscope coupled to an AxioCamMR3
camera driven by the AxioVision 4.7 software (Carl
Zeiss, North Ryde, Australia). For the vascular-disruption
assay, endothelial cells were first allowed to undergo
morphogenesis and form capillary-like structures for
6 h before drug treatment was initiated. Photographs
were then taken using the same microscope device after
2h drug incubation. The anti-angiogenic and vasculardisrupting activities of the compounds were then
quantitatively evaluated by measuring the total surface
area of capillary tubes formed in at least 10 view fields
per well using AxioVision 4.7 software. Time-lapse

Growth inhibition assay
Growth inhibition assays were performed using
either Alamar blue (for MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, HMEC1 and BMH29L cells) or MTT (for SKBR3, HBL-100,
A549, SK-N-SH and U87), as previously described [46,
47]. For all cell lines, the number of cells seeded (from
1,500 to 10,000 cells per well, depending on the cell line)
in 96-well plates was first optimized to ensure sustained
exponential growth for 4-6 days. For all cell lines (with
the exception of SK-N-SH cells, which were allowed to
adhere for 72h before treatment was initiated), cells were
treated 24h after seeding with a range of concentrations
of i) propranolol alone (1 x 10-7 to 1 x 10-4 M), ii)
chemotherapeutic drugs alone (1 x 10-8 to 5 x 10-4 M and 1
x 10-11 to 1 x 10-7 M for 5-FU and paclitaxel, respectively)
or iii) chemotherapeutic drugs in combination with
propranolol at the lowest effective concentration (IC15).
After 72h drug incubation, metabolic activity was
detected by addition of Alamar blue or MTT followed
by spectrophotometric analysis. Cell proliferation was
determined and expressed as a percentage of untreated
control cells. The determination of IC50 values was
performed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad
Software Inc, La Jolla, CA). Combination index (CI)
values were calculated for all tested drug concentrations
according to the Chou and Talalay method [33, 34] using
the following equation:
where (D)1 and (D)2 represent the dose of agent 1 and

videomicroscopy was also employed to further evaluate
the effects of propranolol on the anti-angiogenic activity
of chemotherapeutic agents, as previously described [38].
Cells were constantly maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 and
photographs were taken every 5 min from the beginning
of drug treatment and for 9 h.

Orthotopic breast cancer model
To evaluate the effect of combining propranolol with
chemotherapy on tumor growth and survival, 7 weeksold NMRI nude mice were injected into the mammary
fat pad with 50,000 MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN human
breast cancer cells expressing firefly luciferase (Caliper
Life Science, Villepinte, France) resuspended in 50 μL
of a 30% MatrigelTM solution. Mice were randomized
into 4 different groups 18 days after tumor cell injection
following confirmation of engraftment. Treatment was

initiated 3 weeks after injection and consisted of i.p
injections of i) saline (5 days a week for up to 5 weeks),
ii) paclitaxel alone (20 mg/kg, 3 days a week for 3
weeks), iii) propranolol alone (10 mg/kg, 5 days a week
for 5 weeks) or iv) the combination of paclitaxel and
propranolol following the same administration schedule.
Tumor growth was monitored by weekly bioluminescence
measurements using the Spectrum IVIS system (Caliper
Life Science, Villepinte, France). Briefly, light expressed
as photon/sec was measured 15 minutes after i.p injection
of 200 mg/kg Luciferine (Caliper Life Science, Villepinte,
France), a time-lag ensuring the signal to reach a plateau.
After acquisition, signals were converted into 3D pictures
using the Living Image 4.2 software (Caliper Life
Science, Villepinte, France). Mice were sacrificed when
tumor size reached 5,000 mm3 (as determined using a
vernier caliper and the standard formula tumor volume
= (thickness x length x width) x π / 6) or when signs of
morbidity became apparent (e.g., ataxia, signs of pain or
distress, loss of > 15% of initial weight, loss of mobility
due to tumor growth).
The combination of propranolol and 5-FU was
also evaluated using the same orthotopic model of
triple-negative breast cancer with slight modifications.
Briefly, 7 weeks-old NMRI nude mice were injected
into the mammary fat pad with 10,000 MDA-MB-231luc-D3H2LN cells in absence of MatrigelTM. Mice were
randomized into 4 different groups 7 days after tumor
cell injection following confirmation of engraftment.
Treatment was initiated 2 weeks after injection and
consisted of i.p injections of i) saline (5 days a week
for up to 8 weeks), ii) 5-FU alone (30 mg/kg, 3 days a
week for 5 weeks), iii) propranolol alone (10 mg/kg, 5
days a week for up to 8 weeks) or iv) the combination of
5-FU and propranolol following the same administration
schedule. Tumor growth was monitored by weekly
bioluminescence measurement using the same protocol
and device described above. Mice were sacrificed when
tumor size reached 5,000 mm3 or when signs of morbidity
became apparent.
