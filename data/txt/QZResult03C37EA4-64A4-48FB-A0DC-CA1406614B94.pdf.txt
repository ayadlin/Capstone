BACKGROUND: TrkB expression is associated with poor prognosis for patients with neuroblastoma. AZ623 is a novel
potent and selective inhibitor of the Trk family of tyrosine kinases. The authors hypothesized that AZ623 would inhibit TrkB-mediated signaling in neuroblastoma tumor cells and would be synergistic when combined with chemotherapy. METHODS: Neuroblastoma cell lines were screened for TrkB receptor mRNA expression and for their
proliferation rates in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The effects of AZ623 on Trk receptor
phosphorylation, signaling, and cell growth were evaluated in BDNF-treated neuroblastoma cells. Mice with human
neuroblastoma xenograft tumors were treated with AZ623 alone and in combination with topotecan, and tumor
growth rates were determined during and after treatment. RESULTS: Neuroblastoma cell lines expressed various levels of the TrkB receptor and demonstrated increased proliferation in response to BDNF. BDNF treatment stimulated
TrkB phosphorylation and downstream signaling that could be inhibited by AZ623. Neuroblastoma cells demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to AZ623, with concentration that inhibits 50% (IC50) values between 0.8 to 7 lM. AZ623
treatment was found to inhibit BDNF-mediated neuroblastoma cell proliferation. Mice with human neuroblastoma
xenograft tumors demonstrated tumor growth inhibition when treated with AZ623 and with AZ623 combined with
topotecan. Limited tumor regrowth was noted in mice with tumors treated with AZ623 combined with topotecan after treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: AZ623 is a novel selective Trk inhibitor that inhibits BDNF-mediated
signaling and neuroblastoma cell proliferation. AZ623 treatment inhibits the growth of human neuroblastoma xenograft tumors, and treatment with AZ623 combined with topotecan results in the prolonged inhibition of tumor

Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. However, overall survival rates for
children with high-risk neuroblastoma are approximately 30% with current treatment regimens,1-3 despite intensive treatment that includes high-dose chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and retinoic acid.4 Furthermore, children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma have poor responses to salvage therapy and have a median survival of <6 months.5
Biologically targeted therapies may provide alternative treatments that are more easily administered and potentially less
toxic options for these patients.
The TRK gene family encodes 3 growth factor receptors for the neurotrophin family of ligands, including nerve
growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). The 3 Trk receptor isoforms, TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, have well-defined roles in neuronal development.6,7 Trk receptors have also been shown to
have roles in malignant transformation, chemotaxis, metastasis, and survival in human tumors.8-10 In neuroblastoma
tumors, TrkB expression is a strong predictor of aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis, while TrkA expression is

associated with good prognosis.11 Furthermore, TrkB
overexpression and signaling through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling axis is associated
with increased chemotherapy resistance in neuroblastoma
tumor cells.12,13
Based on the many roles of the Trk receptor family
in tumorigenesis, both small molecule and monoclonal
antibody inhibitors of Trk receptors have been developed
for therapeutic purposes. Indolocarbazole analogs k252a
and CEP-701 (lestaurtinib) are Trk kinase inhibitors that
are currently available and that have been shown to be
effective against neuroblastoma in preclinical studies.14,15
However, these agents inhibit a variety of kinase targets,
and their efficacy may be only in part related to their inhibition of Trk kinase activity. CEP-701 has been demonstrated to inhibit the platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), the vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor (VEGFR), the REarranged during Transfection
(RET) and protein kinase C (PKC) kinases and has been
studied in clinical trials for adults as a fms-related tyrosine
kinase 3 (Flt3) inhibitor for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and as a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) kinase inhibitor in myeloproliferative disorders.16-19
The linkage between Trk receptor expression and
neuroblastoma pathophysiology suggests that Trk kinase
inhibitors may be effective for the treatment of children
with neuroblastoma. AZ623, a selective small molecule
inhibitor of the Trk tyrosine kinase family, is a potent
ATP-competitive inhibitor of the Trk receptor kinase
family and blocks tumor growth in a preclinical neuroblastoma xenograft model.20 We hypothesized that
AZ623 would inhibit BDNF-mediated signaling and
proliferation in neuroblastoma tumor cells and would be
synergistically effective with chemotherapy against neuroblastoma xenograft tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and Culture Conditions
The characteristics of neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-SH,
SH-EP, SH-SY5Y, NGP, CHP-134, LA1-55N, SK-NAS, SMS-KCN, SMS-KCNR, and IMR-32 used in this
study have been previously described,21-24 and were generously provided by Susan Cohn (The University of Chicago Children’s Hospital, Chicago, Ill) and John Maris
(Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia,
Penn). Neuroblastoma cell lines were grown at 37 C in
5% carbon dioxide in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
Calif) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bo-

1322

vine serum (USB, Minneapolis, Minn), L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/
streptomycin (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis,
Mo).
Therapeutic Agents
AZ623 was provided by AstraZeneca (Macclesfield,
Cheshire, United Kingdom). A stock solution (100 mM)
was generated in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma Chemical
Company) and stored at 20 C. Before use, a 10-mm
stock solution was created in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and 30% acetic acid. A 10-mm stock solution of
topotecan (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, Calif) was
prepared in PBS and stored. AZ623 and topotecan were
diluted to final concentrations in fresh serum-free cell culture media immediately before cell culture use. Stock solutions of BDNF (Peprotech, Rochy Hill, NJ), NGF
(ProSpec, Rehovot, Israel), and NT-3 (Sigma Chemical
Company) at 100 mg/L were generated in water and
stored at 20 C. Before use, BDNF, NGF, and NT-3
were diluted to final concentrations in fresh serum-free
cell culture media.
Quantitative Reverse
Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Neuroblastoma cells were grown to near-confluence on
10-cm tissue culture plates. Cells were harvested and total
RNA was generated using Qiagen RNeasy Mini-kits following the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Valencia,
Calif). RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, Del). cDNA
was synthesized using the Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers
for TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC (NTRK1, NTRK2, and
NTRK3; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) was
performed using a BioRad iCycler iQ real-time PCR
detection system with relative levels normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Cell Proliferation/Viability Assays
Approximately 5000 neuroblastoma cells per well were
plated in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight.
Cells were then treated with 10 ng/mL of BDNF, NGF,
or NT-3 for 72 hours. KCN cells were subjected to additional studies at concentrations of BDNF from 0.1 ng/mL
to 10 ng/mL. Ten lL of AlamarBlue reagent (Invitrogen)
was added to each well and plates were incubated at 37 C
for at least 2 hours. Plates were read on a Spectramax

Gemini EM spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) at 544 nanometers (nm) and 590 nm. For
viability assays, cells were treated with 0 to 10 lM of
AZ623 for 72 hours and AlamarBlue assays were performed as described. Additional wells were treated with
0.1, 1.0, or 10 ng/mL BDNF combined with 0.1, 1.0, or
10 lM AZ623 for 48 hours. Concentration that inhibits
50% (IC50) values were derived using best-fit trendlines
and values calculated using the relevant curve-fit
equations.
Cell Morphology
Neuroblastoma cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture
dishes and allowed to grow to approximately 70% confluence. Cells were then treated with 1.25 lM of AZ623, 15
nM of topotecan, or both for 72 hours. Cells were photographed at 200 magnification with a Nikon Digital
Sight DS-L1 camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse TS 100
Microscope (Nikon Inc, Melville, NY). Additional cells
were treated as above, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assays were then performed on the cells, following the
manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, Wis),
followed by counterstaining with Hoescht 33342 stain
(dilution of 1:10,000; Invitrogen) and the addition of an
antifade reagent (SlowFade Gold; Invitrogen)
Cell Signaling Assays
Neuroblastoma cells were plated on 10-cm tissue culture
plates and grown until approximately 70% confluent.
The cells were then washed, placed in serum-free media
overnight, treated with 0 to 100 ng/mL BDNF for 15
minutes, and then harvested. Additional cells were treated
with 25 nM or 50 nM AZ623 for 50 minutes, followed
by 0 to 100 ng/mL BDNF for an additional 10 minutes.
Cells were collected and incubated for 5 minutes with
PhosphoSafe Extraction Reagent (Novagen, Darmstadt,
Germany). Fifty lg of total denatured protein from each
sample was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to 0.22-lM polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membranes using standard techniques. Membranes were
blocked with 5% milk and incubated with primary antibodies to total (Cell Signaling, Danvers, Mass; #4606)

phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling; 9154S), all
diluted to appropriate concentrations in 2.5% milk. Membranes were washed and incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ; NA931V and NA934V)
and then developed with the ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) and a Kodak film
developer (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY).
Mouse Experiments
NOD/SCID/IL2Rc mice (stock #005557; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me) at the age of 6 to 8 weeks were
inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank with 7 
107 neuroblastoma tumor cells. Once tumors were palpable (approximately 5 mm in diameter), mice were treated
once daily, 5 days per week, by gavage feeding with either
vehicle alone, AZ623 alone (100 mg/kg/day), topotecan
alone (1.5 mg/kg/day),25 or AZ623 combined with topotecan. Drugs were diluted in 100 lL of 0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC)/0.1% Tween-80 (Sigma
Chemical Company). Five to 6 mice were treated in each
group. Tumor measurements were obtained 3 times per
week by the same investigator (L.Z.) using Vernier calipers (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Penn) and tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: tumor
volume ¼ (length width2)/2. Animals were sacrificed 14
days after the initiation of treatment and tumors were subsequently harvested for further analysis. Tumors harvested
from mice were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Serial sections were used for immunofluorescence
analysis. TUNEL assays were then performed on the sections, as described above, followed by counterstaining
with Hoescht 33342 1:10,000 dilution; Invitrogen)
and the addition of antifade reagent (SlowFade Gold;
Invitrogen).
In a separate experiment, mice with subcutaneous
xenograft tumors were treated as detailed above with
AZ623, topotecan, or AZ623 plus topotecan. Three to 4
mice were treated in each group. After 14 days, treatment
was discontinued and tumor regrowth was monitored for
an additional 15 days to determine regrowth rates. All animals were treated according to National Institutes of
Health (NIH) guidelines for animal care and use, and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center.

in neuroblastoma tumor cells. (A) Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of total TrkB
(TrkBTOT), full-length TrkB (TrkBFL), and p75NTR mRNA levels was performed in 8 neuroblastoma cell lines. Expression
levels are shown relative to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression in each cell line.

Statistical Analysis
Experiments were performed in triplicate unless otherwise
noted. Two-tailed Student t test and analysis of variance
were used to compare the significance between mean values for in vitro experiments and between xenograft tumor
sizes in vivo, respectively.

RESULTS
Expression of TrkB Receptor in
Neuroblastoma Cell Lines
In order to determine the expression pattern of TrkB in
neuroblastoma cell lines, a panel of neuroblastoma cell
lines was evaluated for expression of TrkB receptor
mRNA. RT-PCR demonstrated variable levels of mRNA,
with the highest levels identified in KCN cells, which had
approximately 10,000-fold higher expression levels than
LA155N cells, which had the lowest TrkB mRNA expression level (Fig. 1).
Response of Neuroblastoma Tumor Cells to
TrkB Stimulation With BDNF
In order to determine the responses of neuroblastoma tumor cells to the Trk receptor ligands NGF, BDNF, and
NT-3, neuroblastoma cell lines were exposed to 10 ng/
mL of each ligand and evaluated for cellular proliferation.
BDNF resulted in the highest amount of cell proliferation
in each of the tested cell lines (Fig. 2A). An expanded
panel of neuroblastoma cell lines was then exposed to
increasing concentrations of BDNF to determine the rela-

tive responsiveness of each cell line. KCN cells were the
most sensitive, demonstrating significantly increased cell
proliferation in response to as little as 0.1 ng/mL of
BDNF. All other cell lines demonstrated increased cell
proliferation at doses of BDNF >10 ng/mL (Fig. 2B; data
not shown).
In order to evaluate which downstream signaling
pathways were activated by BDNF stimulation, neuroblastoma tumor cells were treated with increasing concentrations of BDNF, and the activation status of potential
downstream signaling targets was evaluated by immunoblot analysis for phosphorylation. BDNF stimulation
with up to 20 ng/mL resulted in phosphorylation of the
TrkB receptor in addition to the PI3K, AKT, BAD,
p70S6K, and RPS6 proteins, but not the MEK or ERK
kinase members (Fig. 3A), suggesting a role for multiple
signaling pathways in the proliferative response of neuroblastoma tumor cells to BDNF.

Figure 3. Analysis of neuroblastoma cell signaling in response
to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is shown. (A)
Neuroblastoma cells were treated with 0 to 20 ng/mL of
BDNF for 15 minutes and then harvested and lysed. Cell
lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by
Western blot for phosphorylated TrkB, phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, BAD, p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6
(RPS6), MEK1/2, and ERK1/2. Neuroblastoma cells were also
treated with BDNF with or without AZ623 at the indicated
concentrations, or were left untreated and immunoblots were
performed on cell lysates for (B) phosphorylated TrkB
(pTrkB) and total TrkB and (C) AKT and RPS6.

Inhibition of Trk Receptor Phosphorylation
and Downstream Signaling by AZ623
AZ623 has been demonstrated to specifically inhibit the
phosphorylation of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC in cell lines
in vitro.20 In order to confirm that AZ623 could inhibit
TrkB phosphorylation in our neuroblastoma model systems, neuroblastoma tumor cells were treated with BDNF
to stimulate TrkB receptor phosphorylation. This TrkB
phosphorylation could be inhibited by co-incubation
with AZ623 (Fig. 3B).
In order to evaluate whether the downstream signaling pathways activated by BDNF would be inhibited by
AZ623, neuroblastoma tumor cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of BDNF, and the activation
status of potential downstream signaling targets was evaluated by immunoblot analysis for phosphorylation. Both
AKT and RPS6 were phosphorylated after BDNF treatment, and this phosphorylation could be inhibited by coincubation with AZ623 (Fig. 3C).
Effects of AZ623 on Neuroblastoma
Tumor Cell Viability and BDNF-Mediated
Proliferation
In order to determine the effects of AZ623 on cell viability, neuroblastoma tumor cells were treated with increasing concentrations of AZ623, cell viability was measured,
and IC50 values were calculated. The majority of neuroblastoma cell lines had calculated IC50 values between

demonstrated significantly increased sensitivity and an
IC50 value of 800 nM (Fig. 4).
In order to evaluate whether the neuroblastoma cell
proliferation induced by BDNF could be inhibited by
AZ623, neuroblastoma tumor cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of BDNF with or without
AZ623, and cell viability was measured and normalized to
untreated cells. Neuroblastoma viability was increased after BDNF treatment, and this proliferation could be
inhibited by AZ623 (Fig. 5).
Effects of AZ623 Combined With Topotecan
on Neuroblastoma Tumor Cells
With the need for more effective combination therapies in
children with neuroblastoma, we wanted to determine
effective combinations of established treatments with

AZ623. Topotecan has been demonstrated to be an
effective agent against neuroblastoma tumor cells in preclinical models and in patients with neuroblastoma.25-28
Neuroblastoma tumor cells were treated with AZ623,
topotecan, or the combination of AZ623 with topotecan. Treatment with either AZ623 or topotecan alone
resulted in cell rounding and detachment from the cell
surface, which was significantly increased when the 2
agents were combined (Fig. 6A-6D). Treatment with
AZ623 did not induce significant apoptosis, as demonstrated by TUNEL staining (Fig. 6F), while treatment
with the combination of AZ623 plus topotecan resulted
in more TUNEL-positive cells compared with topotecan alone (Fig. 6G and 6H), suggesting a synergistic
effect.
The combination of AZ623 and topotecan was then
tested in immunocompromised mice with human neuroblastoma xenograft tumors. Treatment of mice with
human neuroblastoma xenografts with AZ623 or topotecan alone resulted in significantly reduced growth. Treatment of these mice with the combination of AZ623 and
topotecan resulted in nearly complete inhibition of tumor
growth (Fig. 7A, 7C and 7D) and in an increase in
TUNEL-positive tumor cells, suggesting that the tumor
growth inhibition was secondary to induction of intratumoral apoptosis (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, after the cessation of treatment, mice previously treated with AZ623 or
topotecan alone demonstrated significant regrowth of
xenograft tumors, while mice treated with the combination of AZ623 and topotecan demonstrated almost complete inhibition of tumor regrowth (Fig. 7E), with final

1326

tumor volumes reduced by 89% and 86%, respectively,
compared with AZ623 or topotecan alone.

DISCUSSION
New treatment strategies are needed for children with
high-risk and recurrent neuroblastoma. We demonstrated
that the novel Trk kinase inhibitor AZ623 effectively
inhibits BDNF-mediated signaling and neuroblastoma
cell proliferation. Furthermore, AZ623 combined with
topotecan represents a novel synergistic combination that
is effective at inhibiting neuroblastoma xenograft tumor
growth, even after the discontinuation of therapy.
AZ623 is a novel and potent small molecule Trk inhibitor with a selectivity profile distinct from other
reported agents. AZ623 inhibits the 3 Trk isoforms
(TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) at low nanomolar concentrations in cellular assays, but in vitro screening of AZ623
against a large panel of other kinases revealed only minimal activity.20 Our results with AZ623 suggest that
selective Trk inhibition may be sufficient to inhibit neuroblastoma tumor growth in vivo, particularly when combined with topotecan, a topoisomerase inhibitor that has
been shown to be effective against neuroblastoma in early
phase clinical trials,26,29 and is currently used for children
with neuroblastoma in upfront treatment regimens and in
cases of recurrent or refractory disease.27
In the current study, we have demonstrated variable
levels of TrkB receptor mRNA expression in a panel of
neuroblastoma cell lines. Each of the tested neuroblastoma cell lines demonstrated increased proliferation in

the sections (representative sections are shown). (C) Tumor measurements were obtained and tumor volumes were calculated

response to BDNF, suggesting a critical role for TrkB signaling in the control of neuroblastoma cell proliferation.
The mechanisms of the observed variability in the sensitivity of neuroblastoma cell lines to AZ623 is not clear.
SMS-KCN neuroblastoma cells demonstrated the highest
levels of TrkB expression and were the most sensitive to
AZ623. Responses to AZ623 in the other tested neuroblastoma cell lines do not appear to be correlated with
expression levels of TrkB or with other known biologic
features of neuroblastoma tumor cells, such as N-myc
amplification or chromosome 1p deletion.
Data accumulated over the past decade have clearly
established Trk receptors as viable targets for anticancer
therapy. Small molecular weight kinase inhibitors offer
the most straightforward approach to the clinical targeting

of the Trk receptors. For example, CEP-701 (lestaurtinib), a potent and orally available pan-Trk kinase inhibitor, has shown activity against a range of in vivo models,
including prostate, pancreatic, and thyroid cancer xenografts.30-32 However, lestaurtinib inhibits several additional tyrosine kinase targets and remains active in trials in
clinical settings in which Trk kinases are not believed to
be pathogenic, such as acute myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative disease.17-19 Therefore, the development of
potent and selective Trk kinase inhibitors remains critical
to evaluate the role of Trk signaling pathway inhibition in
the treatment of patients with neuroblastoma.
AZ623 represents a novel agent with the potential
for therapeutic utility in the treatment of children with
neuroblastoma. We have demonstrated that AZ623

inhibits BDNF-mediated neuroblastoma cell signaling
and proliferation and that the combination of AZ623 and
topotecan is effective against neuroblastoma tumor cells
in vitro and in vivo. The evidence for the role of Trk receptor signaling in stimulating neuroblastoma tumor cell
growth and the demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy
of the combination of AZ623 and topotecan in these
studies provide biological and clinical rationale for the
further exploration of this combination and testing in
children with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma.
