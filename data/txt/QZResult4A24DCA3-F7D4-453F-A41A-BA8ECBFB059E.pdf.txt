Darkness Before Dawn, But Will the Sun Always Rise?
Sai-Hong Ignatius Ou, MD, PhD1,2

In this issue of Cancer, Sacher et al1 report a retrospective analysis of the real-world use of chemotherapy from 2005 to
2009 in patients with advanced-stage non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the Canadian province of Ontario. Surprisingly, they report that only 24% of all patients with advanced-stage NSCLC received first-line chemotherapy. Furthermore, only 31% of the patients who received first-line chemotherapy received second-line chemotherapy, and this
translated into only 7.5% of all patients with advanced-stage NSCLC receiving any second-line chemotherapy. Although
the percentage of patients who received chemotherapy increased over time, still only 26% of patients with advanced-stage
NSCLC received first-line chemotherapy in 2009, the last year analyzed by Sacher et al. Sacher et al also report that the average age of NSCLC patients who received chemotherapy was substantially lower (62 years) than the average age of
patients who did not receive chemotherapy (69 years). This province-wide analysis was an extension of a previous analysis
of 2 major referral cancer centers in Ontario in which only 42% of patients with advanced-stage NSCLC received chemotherapy and 60% of the patients who received chemotherapy received 2 or more lines of chemotherapy.2 The contemporaneous usage of chemotherapy was similar in other Canadian provinces: 16% (January to December 1998), 23% (May
2001 to April 2002), 34% (March 2006 to February 2007), and 33% (November 2007 to October 2008) of all patients
with advanced-stage NSCLC in the province of British Columbia received first-line chemotherapy.3 In another study,
only 54% of 1373 patients with advanced-stage NSCLC diagnosed in British Columbia in 2009 were referred to medical
oncologists.4 Among the patients who were referred to medical oncologists, only 56% received chemotherapy, and this
resulted in only 30% of all patients with advanced NSCLC receiving any chemotherapy at all.4
These observations are not unique to Canada. Owonikoko et al5 performed a similar analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)–Medicare database on the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with advanced
NSCLC between 1988 and 2005 in the United States. The results were very similar to the observations of Sacher et al.1
Although the percentage of US SEER-Medicare patients who received chemotherapy increased significantly with time, on
average, only 29% of patients received chemotherapy over the study period from 1988 to 2005. Between 2004 and 2005,
only 32.7% of patients with stage IV NSCLC and surprisingly only 36.5% of patients with stage IIIB NSCLC in the
SEER-Medicare database received any chemotherapy.5 In a more recent SEER-Medicare period, only 46% (2006-2007)
and 48% (2006-2009) of bevacizumab-eligible patients with nonsquamous NSCLC received any chemotherapy.6,7 The
SEER-Medicare database is limited to patients who are generally 65 years or older because of an age requirement for
enrollment in Medicare. The use of chemotherapy in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC between 2000 and 2007 was
higher among 4 health maintenance groups versus the SEER-Medicare database, but still only 54.6% of patients received
first-line chemotherapy. The percentage of chemotherapy use increased from 51% in 2000 to 59% in 2007.8 It is important to note that in all the aforementioned studies, chemotherapy use significantly improved the survival of patients with
advanced NSCLC regardless of the location or treatment period, whereas supportive care alone did not.
Meanwhile, since 2009, there have also been advances in traditional chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC. In
2014, for the first time, the addition of ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor 2, to single-agent docetaxel demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival as a second-line treatment
of NSCLC in a large-scale, randomized phase 3 trial (REVEL).9 The US Food and Drug Administration has approved
ramucirumab plus docetaxel for the treatment of NSCLC after disease progression on platinum-doublet chemotherapy,
regardless of histology. Nivolumab, an anti–programmed cell death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, conferred a

significant overall survival benefit over single-agent docetaxel as a second-line treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs in a randomized phase 3 trial
(CheckMate-017),10 and it was approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration for this indication on March 4,
2015. Currently, there seems to be no validated biomarker for guiding the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in squamous cell carcinoma; hence, the potential cost
of providing this immunotherapy as a second-line treatment for all squamous cell carcinomas may be exorbitant
for any health care system. An important finding of Sacher
et al’s study1 is that carcinoma not otherwise specified
(NOS) constituted 43% of the NSCLC histology diagnoses during the study period. It was not reported in the
study whether the proportion of carcinoma NOS was
increasing over time or not. Histology-based treatment
decisions for NSCLC are important in determining the
use of bevacizumab and pemetrexed and now nivolumab
and potentially referrals for genomic profiling.11 The majority of carcinoma NOS diagnoses were likely due to
small, inadequate biopsy samples. A multidisciplinary
lung cancer tumor board is of utmost importance for
ensuring adequate tissue acquisitions not just for diagnosis
but also for treatment planning.
Furthermore, in 2010, the first of the 7 randomized
phase 3 trials demonstrating significantly improved
progression-free survival (PFS) with epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy for NSCLC
patients harboring common activating EGFR mutations
(EGFRm) was published.12 Recently, afatinib demonstrated a significant improved overall survival benefit over
platinum-doublet chemotherapy among NSCLC patients
harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions.13 Contemporaneously, crizotinib, a multitargeted anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK)/ROS1/MET TKI, has demonstrated significantly improved PFS over platinum-doublet chemotherapy as a first-line treatment among patients with advanced
NSCLC harboring ALK gene rearrangement (ALK1).14
In addition, crizotinib conferred an impressive PFS of
19.2 months among patients with advanced ROS1-rearranged (ROS11) NSCLC.15 Meanwhile, many more
actionable driver mutations are being profiled during the
routine care of NSCLC patients.16 Reflex testing for
EGFRm and ALK rearrangement is now recommended by
guidelines developed by multiple professional societies.11
In the future, the approval of an increasing number of
targeted therapies against unique molecular subsets of
NSCLC will put a huge financial burden on any health
care system because of the constant need to pay for

additional diagnostic tests. Indeed, the utilization of
EGFR testing was widely adopted across all provinces in
Canada but dropped off significantly when funding for
EGFR testing was discontinued by the pharmaceutical
industries.17 ALK immunohistochemistry has been shown
to be sensitive, specific, and cost-effective for screening for
ALK rearrangement.18 The Canadian ALK study group
has successfully demonstrated a high level of correlation
between centers in interpreting ALK immunohistochemistry results,19 and this will potentially allow future
widespread adoption of ALK rearrangement screening in
Canada.
The answer to the question posed by Sacher
et al.1—are patients with advanced NSCLC being undertreated?—is an unqualified yes. The answer to the
obvious follow-up question of why is a lot harder to capture. One of them is likely referral bias. Noonan et al4
reported that in 2009, only 54% of patients with
advanced NSCLC were referred to medical oncologists.
In Sacher et al’s study, 70% of the patients with
advanced NSCLC were referred to medical oncologists.
Continuous education of primary care physicians by
dedicated thoracic oncologists (ie, the treatment of lung
cancer has advanced over time, and chemotherapy
options have increased and are more tolerable and efficacious) may help increase the referral rate. Another answer
is potential nihilism even among medical oncologists. In
Noonan et al’s study, only 56% of the patients referred
to medical oncologists received chemotherapy. In Sacher
et al’s study, only 34% of the patients were given chemotherapy by medical oncologists. The wider use of EGFR
TKIs in patients with EGFRm NSCLC and ALK inhibitors in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC may alleviate some of the nihilism of prescribing chemotherapy
among medical oncologists.
In summary, we can define the period before 2009
as a period of darkness during which there was widespread underuse of chemotherapy in advanced-stage
NSCLC patients. Since 2009, an increasing armamentarium of chemotherapy/targeted/immunotherapy agents
has been improving the overall survival of lung cancer
patients and ushering in the dawn of a new era of lung
cancer treatment. It will be important to continue to capture the real-world usage of these novel and expensive
drugs to help us to appreciate whether positive clinical
trial results are being implemented on a daily basis (“will
the sun always rise?”) and to identify ways to overcome
barriers to their optimal use. The current study by Sacher
et al1 and other studies could serve as excellent references
for future comparisons.
