BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to elucidate relative preferences of women with ovarian cancer for symptoms,
treatment-related side effects, and progression-free survival (PFS) relevant to choosing a treatment regimen. METHODS: Women
with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer participated in a survey that included 3 methods to measure patient preferences (ratings,
rankings, and a discrete-choice experiment) for 7 attributes: mode of administration, visit frequency, peripheral neuropathy, nausea
and vomiting, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and PFS. Participants were asked to choose between 2 unlabeled treatment scenarios
that were characterized using the 7 attributes. Each participant completed 12 choice questions in which attribute levels were assigned
according to an experimental design and a fixed-choice question representing 2 chemotherapy regimens for ovarian cancer.
RESULTS: In total, 95 women completed the survey. Participants’ ratings and rankings revealed greater concern and importance for
PFS than for any other attribute (P <.0001 for all). The discrete-choice experiment revealed that the relative odds that a participant
would choose a scenario with 18 months, 21 months, and 24 months of PFS versus 15 months of PFS were 1.5 (P 5.01), 3.4 (P <.001),
and 7.5 (P <.001), respectively. However, participants’ choices indicated that they were willing to accept a shorter PFS to avoid severe
side effects: 6.7 months to reduce nausea and vomiting from severe to mild, 5.0 months to reduce neuropathy from severe to mild,
and 3.7 months to reduce abdominal symptoms from severe to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: PFS is the predominant driver of patient
preferences for chemotherapy regimens. However, women in the current study were willing to trade significant PFS time for reducC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Although ovarian cancer mortality has dropped slightly over the past 10 years, major therapeutic breakthroughs resulting
in overall survival (OS) improvements have been infrequent. Most recently, intraperitoneal chemotherapy1 and dosedense paclitaxel2 have demonstrated the ability to provide superior OS versus comparators in the primary treatment setting. It has also been demonstrated that the addition of biologic therapies like bevacizumab to intravenous chemotherapy
regimens improve progression-free survival (PFS), and OS improvement is observed only in subgroup analyses.3,4 Neither
of these traditional clinical trial endpoints, OS or PFS, considers how a treatment affects adverse events, quality of life
(QOL), and convenience to the patient. Practitioners’ understanding of the relative importance of these factors is critical
when considering how to best present treatment options to patients.
Patients are likely to have opinions about the relative importance of different types of expected outcomes of their
cancer treatment. The preferences of cancer patients concerning quality versus length of life have been reported,5,6 but
only rarely in the context of a stated preference study in which patients were asked to jointly consider several aspects of
ovarian cancer treatments.7,8 Conjoint analysis represents an approach that systematically examines the factors that drive
an individual’s choice. One type of conjoint analysis, discrete-choice experiments (DCEs), have been used traditionally in
marketing and, more recently, have been used to examine determinants of patients’ preferences for aspects of their health
care.9 In a DCE, individuals are asked to consider 2 or more hypothetical scenarios and choose the 1 that is preferable to
them. Their selections allow researchers to investigate tradeoffs between positive and negative aspects of the scenarios. In

Discrete-Choice Experiment

DCEs, a specific type of conjoint analysis,12-14 are used to
quantify preferences for specific attributes or features of
health states, medical interventions, or health care services. Participants in a DCE are asked to choose between
alternative constructed profiles that are characterized by
specified levels of each outcome and convenience feature
or attribute in the study design. Repeated iterations of this
exercise provide data to statistically estimate rates at which
respondents are willing to accept tradeoffs among attributes. Guided by best-practice recommendations for conducting conjoint analysis,9,15 we sought to test whether 7
attributes relevant to chemotherapy for ovarian cancer
were associated with participants’ choices and to evaluate
the extent to which women were willing to trade clinical
benefits for reduced toxicity associated with treatment.
Selection of Attributes and Levels of
Chemotherapy Treatment

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This prospective study of 100 women with advanced or
recurrent ovarian cancer was approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board. The sample size was determined by constraints of budget and time. Inclusion criteria
were a diagnosis of stage III/IV or recurrent ovarian cancer
and signed informed consent. The recruitment period was
from May to October 2013. Patients who met inclusion criteria received a study brochure from their attending gynecologic oncologist by mail or in person during a scheduled
appointment and were approached for informed consent if
they expressed interest in participating. Clinical characteristics were abstracted from each participant’s medical record.

Scenarios were developed to represent the key attributes
of standard chemotherapy regimens for newly diagnosed,
advanced-stage ovarian cancer identified by clinical
experts and investigators with extensive experience in
PROs (Table 1). The 7 attributes included symptoms of
ovarian cancer (abdominal symptoms), side effects that
are relatively common with standard platinum-based and
taxane-based chemotherapy regimens (neuropathy, nausea and vomiting, fatigue), features of administration that
differ between the intravenous and intraperitoneal/intravenous chemotherapy regimens (route of administration
and frequency), and a measure of benefit (PFS). We chose
to present participants with PFS information but not OS
information. Inclusion of both would have required
restrictions in the DCE study design to disallow OS periods that were shorter than PFS periods, and this would
have led to suboptimal statistical assumptions and would
have caused confusion among participants. Furthermore,
PFS currently is often the primary endpoint for phase 3
trials in ovarian cancer.16 The levels for each attribute
were chosen to represent administration modalities, dosing frequency, and the range of severity of toxicities and
benefits associated with standard chemotherapy regimens.

Experimental Design

oncology scenarios, this may include tradeoffs between
the additional survival afforded by a proposed cancer
treatment and the side effects, inconveniences, or costs of
the treatment. We applied a DCE to study the preferences
of women with ovarian cancer for disease-related symptoms, side effects, PFS, and administration characteristics
associated with various treatment regimens.

Within the survey instrument, participants were asked to
report their current age, race, and ethnicity and to complete 2 validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments: the Functional Assessment of Cancer TherapyOvarian (FACT-O)10 and the MD Anderson Symptom
Inventory (MDASI)11.

There were 1296 possible combinations of attribute levels,
as indicated in Table 1. The pairs of profiles chosen for
the choice questions were generated using a balancedoverlap experimental design with the Sawtooth Conjoint
Value Analysis (CVA) designer (Sawtooth Software; SSI
Web, Orem, Utah). In total, 120 pairs of choice questions

peritoneal paclitaxel (“both intravenous and intraperitoneal treatments”: 2 visits every 3 weeks; moderate nausea/
vomiting, moderate neuropathy, moderate fatigue, and
moderate abdominal symptoms; and 24-month PFS);
and 2) intravenous paclitaxel and intravenous carboplatin
(“intravenous treatment only”: 1 visit every 3 weeks; mild
nausea/vomiting, mild neuropathy, mild fatigue, and
mild abdominal symptoms; and 18-month PFS). Attribute levels for these scenarios were based on administration
regimens, general side-effect profiles, and PFS estimates
from published randomized clinical trials.1,17
Pretesting

We pretested the full computer-administered survey
instrument with 5 patients and used qualitative interviewing methods to gauge their understanding, with a plan to
exclude these participants from the final analysis if significant revisions to the survey were necessary.

were generated and blocked into 10 questionnaire versions, each consisting of 12 unique choice questions that
were randomly assigned to study participants. Supporting
Figure 1 (see online supporting materials) displays an
example choice question.

Statistical Analysis
Rating and ranking data

We used descriptive statistics to summarize ratings and
rankings for each of the 7 DCE attributes. We used paired
t tests to compare distributions of rankings and ratings
between attributes.
Choice-experiment data

After the video, each participant was asked to rate her level
of concern for each of the 7 attributes using 5-point Likert
scale from 1 (not concerned) to 5 (deeply concerned) and
then to rank the attributes from 1 (most important) to 7
(least important).

We applied mixed-logit regression to model patients’
choices as a function of attribute levels and estimated odds
ratios (ORs) controlling for unobserved heterogeneity in
preferences. When ORs ratios are >1.00, the estimates
indicate greater preference for the attribute level relative
to the reference level. When ORs are <1.00, participants
are expressing a smaller preference for the attribute level
relative to the reference level. We report the results using
both the mean attribute effect (effects coding) and an
omitted category (dummy coding). We also calculated the
suggested time in PFS that participants were willing to
forgo to gain an improvement for each attribute from its
worst level to its best level.18 We refer to this as a PFS-time
equivalent. We used nonparametric bootstrapping to
compute 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the PFS-time
equivalents.

Instrument Design

Exploratory Analyses

In addition to the 12 choice questions, a fixed-choice set
was embedded within the DCE. In this set, the levels for
each of the attributes were set to correspond to an actual
therapeutic choice between 2 standard regimens for the
treatment of newly diagnosed stage III ovarian cancer: 1)
intravenous paclitaxel, intraperitoneal cisplatin, and intra-

Educational Video

To familiarize participants with the 7 attributes and their
corresponding levels, we developed a 9-minute video
(available at: http://vimeo.com/61893779), which was
shown to each participant before completing the preference elicitation (for a transcript of the video, see the online
supporting materials).

Post-hoc analyses

To account for the possibility that some participants
would always choose the alternative with the longest PFS
period despite the levels of other attributes, we reran the
mixed-logit models after excluding women who chose the
scenario with the longest PFS in every choice question in
which PFS levels differed between alternatives.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics

Of 259 eligible patients who initially were provided with
written recruitment materials concerning the study, 100
participants provided informed consent. Five were
excluded from analysis because of early phase data-capture
3654

errors (n52), withdrawal of consent (n52), or participant
no-show (n51); thus, 95 patients remained for the final
analysis (Fig. 1). Participants’ characteristics and PRO
measures are provided in Table 2. Minor technical revisions were made to the survey after pretesting; therefore,
95 participants were retained for analysis. The study population was predominately Caucasian (85%) with
advanced-stage disease at diagnosis (81%). At the time of
the survey, 45 patients (47%) had experienced disease recurrence, 49 (51%) were currently receiving chemotherapy, and 45 (47%) had received at least 2 prior
chemotherapy regimens. The mean Trial Outcome Index
(TOI) of the FACT-O was 78.7, which is similar to the
TOI of women who were enrolled in a randomized trial of
the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy
for advanced-stage ovarian cancer from data collected several months after they completed primary chemotherapy.19 The mean MDASI symptom severity score was
1.52 (low range).
Ratings and Rankings of Attributes

Table 3 provides the relative levels of concern and rankings for each attribute. PFS received the highest level of
concern (“very concerned”; mean, 4.0); just over 50% of
participants were deeply concerned about PFS, whereas
11% were deeply concerned about abdominal symptoms,
and <10% were deeply concerned about any other attribute. All of the remaining attributes received mean scores
between 2.0 (“a little bit concerned”) and 3.0
(“moderately concerned”). The findings from the ranking
exercise further emphasized the importance of PFS, with
nearly 76% of respondents assigning the top ranking
(most important; 1.0) to this attribute. Treatment modality and treatment schedule were of least concern and
importance.
Discrete-Choice Experiments

ORs indicating greater (ie, >1.00) or lesser (ie, <1.00)
preference for each of the attribute levels relative to the
mean effect (effects coding) or relative to the reference
level (dummy coding) for each attribute are presented in
Table 4. Figure 2 graphically depicts the relative impact of
attribute levels on treatment choices. With regard to treatment regimen, participants were significantly less likely
(OR, 0.81; P<.01) to prefer the intraperitoneal/intravenous route of administration compared with intravenous
administration. They did not differ significantly with
regard to a preference between 1 visit every 3 weeks or 2
visits every 3 weeks, but a weekly visit was preferred significantly less (OR, 0.68; P<.01). Side-effect preferences for

nausea and vomiting and for fatigue were consistent with
the natural ordering, as expected: less severe levels were
preferred to more severe levels. Participants discriminated
between moderate versus mild levels of severity (OR,
0.60; P<.01) for nausea and vomiting. However, participants’ choices were not significantly different for scenarios
with moderate versus mild levels of peripheral neuropathy
(P5.57) or fatigue (P5.69).
Findings pertaining to the severity of abdominal
symptoms were unexpected. Although participants were
less likely to prefer scenarios that included severe abdominal symptoms compared with mild abdominal symptoms
(OR, 0.63; P<.0001), they were significantly more likely
to prefer scenarios with moderate relative to mild abdominal symptoms (OR, 1.43; P5.003). Compared with a
PFS of 15 months, women progressively preferred longer
periods of PFS.
Given the 9-month difference between the highest
and lowest levels of PFS, participants’ choices indicated
that they would accept a PFS reduction of 6.7 months
(95% CI, 5.4-8.3 months) to move from a health state
characterized by severe nausea and vomiting during treatment to a health state characterized by mild nausea and
vomiting (Table 4). For an improvement from severe peripheral neuropathy to mild neuropathy, participants
were willing to give up 5.0 months of PFS (95% CI, 3.96.2 months). An improvement from severe to moderate
abdominal symptoms was equivalent to 3.7 months of
PFS (95% CI, 2.6-5.0 months).
Group Comparisons

DCE findings were similar between women who currently
were receiving chemotherapy and those who were not and
Cancer

between women with disease recurrence and those without (Supporting Fig. 2; see online supporting materials).
Post-hoc analysis

Twenty participants (21%) always selected the alternative
describing longer PFS despite the other attribute levels
described. When excluding these respondents, findings
from the mixed-logit models revealed very similar findings with regard to the direction of model parameters and
statistical significance but greater willingness to trade off
time in PFS (supporting Table 1; see online supporting
materials).
Fixed-choice scenarios

In the realistic fixed-choice scenario comparing
“intravenous treatment only” versus “both intraperitoneal
and intravenous treatments” (Table 2), 52% of all
respondents chose intraperitoneal/intravenous treatment.
Among patients who had not experienced disease recurrence, 60% opted for the intraperitoneal/intravenous
treatment option compared with 42% of patients who
had experienced disease progression (P5.08) (Supporting
Fig. 3; see online supporting materials). Among patients
who had previously received intraperitoneal administration, 86% chose the intraperitoneal/intravenous alternative compared with 42% who had not previously received
intraperitoneal chemotherapy (P<.01).
DISCUSSION
In the current clinical trial environment, a statistically significant difference in PFS as a primary endpoint may be
considered a success, regardless of the number of months
gained. However, other factors, such as side effects and

clinicians’ and patients’ preferences and also should be
presented when discussing treatment options. Across the
3 sets of questions designed to investigate patients’ prefer3656

ences for treatment outcome and convenience features relevant to treatment of ovarian cancer, we observed that
PFS was the most important factor women considered.
However, in the DCE, 79% of women in our sample
Cancer

Patient Preferences in Ovarian Cancer/Havrilesky et al

accepted reductions in PFS in return for improvements in
side effects or convenience. These findings indicate that
most women in our study were willing to trade off PFS
time for improvements in health-related QOL. Most
strikingly, women’s choices revealed that they were willing
to give up nearly 7 months of PFS to reduce nausea and
vomiting during treatment from a severe level to a mild
level and to give up 5 months of PFS to reduce peripheral
neuropathy from severe to mild. These data are similar to
the findings of Herzog et al, who conducted an online survey of ovarian cancer survivors and reported that women
were only willing to accept higher toxicity if treatment
was potentially curative. Furthermore, survivors who
completed the survey expected a minimum of 5 additional
months of PFS or OS from any new therapy.8
Because DCEs require an individual to consider
tradeoffs among several factors simultaneously, they arguably better represent real-world preferences than rating
and ranking exercises. Although choices made throughout
the design and conduct of complex survey research can
impart potential biases, the consistencies we observed
with regard to hypothesized and observed relations
between factors and across the preference exercises were
reassuring. Women consistently expressed an aversion to
scenarios characterized by severe levels of peripheral neuropathy, abdominal symptoms, and nausea and vomiting.
However, the greater preference for moderate versus mild
abdominal symptoms was perplexing. Upon review of our
descriptions of mild and moderate abdominal symptoms,
our description of the mild level included uncertain events
(eg “may have occasional discomfort”) as opposed to our
use of certain events for the moderate level (eg “has abdominal fullness and tightness”). Other researchers with
experience in conjoint analysis suggest that describing
events as uncertain increases decision-making
complexity.20
When taken in the context of the PFS advantage of 2
to 6 months afforded by recently reported novel therapies
for ovarian cancer like bevacizumab, our data suggest the
need to incorporate women’s preferences into treatment
discussions. The clinical benefit that might be derived
from a novel therapy probably is not defined by PFS
alone; composite endpoints have been developed and put
into practice for a variety of cancers.21,22 Endpoints such
as “clinical benefit response” often are defined by functional status and specific symptoms, but no formal scheme
for weighting components of a composite has been proposed.23 The current data can help inform the development of more principled approaches to developing
patient-centered composite endpoints for ovarian cancer.
Cancer

One limitation to any weighting of a composite endpoint
is that the preferred balance between PFS, QOL, and
treatment toxicity will differ among individuals. Heterogeneity in preferences was evident, because about 1 in 4
women ranked an attribute other than PFS as the most
important. Given the variation in preferences, generating
a patient-specific composite endpoint may be the ultimate
goal to guide decision-making.
Our fixed-choice analysis gives us some insight
into patient preferences regarding intraperitoneal/intravenous chemotherapy, an approach that has demonstrated the ability significantly improve survival
outcomes among women with optimally debulked,
stage III ovarian cancer,1 In the current study, participants were divided fairly evenly with regard to their
preference for intraperitoneal/intravenous versus intravenous chemotherapy. It is noteworthy that those who
had personally received intraperitoneal/intravenous
chemotherapy were significantly more likely to choose
it over intravenous treatment in the fixed-choice question. To put this finding into clinical context, 27% of
the women who had previously received intraperitoneal/intravenous chemotherapy had experienced grade
3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) adverse events with
that treatment, whereas 48% had experienced grade 1
adverse events or less. Patients who had received intraperitoneal/intravenous chemotherapy had a median
PFS of 11 months after that treatment. Despite their
personal experience with the toxicities of intraperitoneal/intravenous treatment, this cohort may have been
more familiar with the OS data from randomized trials
favoring intraperitoneal/intravenous chemotherapy, and
their prior personal choice of this modality may have
strengthened their subsequent stated preferences for intraperitoneal/intravenous administration. It is also
likely that, had all participants been presented with the
large (>1 year) OS advantage of intravenous/intraperitoneal over intravenous chemotherapy that was
observed in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
172 randomized clinical trial1 rather than the smaller
PFS advantage presented in the current study, the intraperitoneal/intravenous regimen would have been
chosen more frequently.
Our study has several limitations. First, we did not
investigate patients’ understanding of the separate concepts of OS and PFS. For the methodological reasons
described above (see Materials and Methods) and the
increasingly common use of PFS, but not OS, as a primary endpoint in phase 3 clinical trials, we chose to present PFS as the only survival outcome for this analysis. The

relative importance of both of these endpoints to patients
is worthy of further study. Our sample size and heterogeneous study population limit the generalizability of our
findings. Sample size estimation for conjoint analysis is
challenging in health care applications9; our sample of 95
patients was sufficient to demonstrate statistically significant differences in utility weights between levels in 6 of
the 7 attributes. However, a larger sample of women with
similar preferences would have provided tighter CIs and
would have provided additional statistical power to make
comparisons between groups. There is also potential bias
introduced by the hypothetical nature of a preferenceelicitation study completed electronically; this method
may reduce the participant’s emotional connection to
each choice. Finally, although use of a video to provide
education about each attribute has the advantage of standardizing this portion of the exercise, its effectiveness compared with a more interactive approach is unknown.
To our knowledge, there have been no reported
studies testing whether a physician’s receipt of preference
information has an impact on treatment decisions or satisfaction among women with ovarian cancer. Elit et al
developed a decision board visual aid to assist in presenting the side effects and survival outcomes of 2 available intravenous chemotherapy options for advanced ovarian
cancer to patients. Those authors observed that use of the
decision board resulted in a greater probability that the
physician would present survival data to women with
newly diagnosed cancer.7 However, the effect on patient
satisfaction or choice was not assessed. Data from patientpreference studies may be useful to providers who are
framing treatment discussions. Likewise, women who are
making difficult treatment decisions may benefit from
studies demonstrating that women like them are willing
to make tradeoffs between benefits and toxicities. This
type of research is applicable to the future development of
shared decision tools to guide both patients and providers
in their treatment choices and recommendations.
In conclusion, our results indicate that, although
PFS is the most important determinant of the choice
between chemotherapy regimens, women may be willing
to give up significant PFS time to avoid specific severe toxicities of a proposed treatment. Patients’ preferences
should be considered and discussed when making shared
cancer-treatment decisions.
