ABSTRACT
Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that produces cartilage matrix. The
most lethal aspect is its metastatic property. We demonstrated that amphiregulin
(AR) is significantly upregulated in highly aggressive cells. AR silencing markedly
suppressed cell migration. Exogenous AR markedly increased cell migration by
transactivation of α6β1 integrin expression. A neutralizing α6β1 integrin antibody can
abolish AR-induced cell motility. Knockdown of AR inhibits metastasis of cells to the
lung in vivo. Furthermore, elevated AR expression is positively correlated with α6β1
integrin levels and higher grades in patients. These findings can potentially serve
as biomarker and therapeutic approach for controlling chondrosarcoma metastasis.

detection, prevention, intervention, and prognostic
evaluation for patients with chondrosarcoma.
Secreted proteins are responsible for the cross
talking among cells, which may facilitate the progression
of metastasis, particularly within the steps of migration
and invasion [2]. Amphiregulin (AR), a ligand of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is synthesized
as a transmembrane precursor that undergoes a series of
proteolytic process to yield mature secreted form [3].
In normal bone development, AR exerts their biological
function by mediating cell migration [4, 5]. AR has also
emerged as an important predictive marker for metastasis
in cancer [6, 7]. Accumulating evidence reveals that

INTRODUCTION
Chondrosarcoma, the second most common type of
bone cancer, is a heterogeneous group of malignancies that
are characterized by the production of cartilage matrix.
High-grade chondrosarcoma is more aggressive and is
more likely to metastasize to other areas of the body.
Although high-grade only occurs in approximately 5–10%
of chondrosarcoma patients, it remains the major cause
of death [1]. Therefore, metastasis is a major obstacle
that must be overcome for the successful treatment
of chondrosarcoma. Exploring the molecular basis of
metastasis may provide further improvements in early

high-level expression of AR is associated with cancer
progression in various types of cancers [8–14].
Previous studies have demonstrated that EGF and
AR are capable of promoting cell motility by increasing
integrin expression [15–17]. AR knock-down cells
revealed a dramatic decrease in invasive capability
and microarray data indicated a statistically significant
difference in integrin expression [18]. Integrins are a
family of heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins
and have been shown to mediate cell-cell or cellmatrix interactions. To date, at least 24 unique integrin
heterodimers have been identified. These heterodimers
are formed from various combinations of 18 α-subunits
and 8 β-subunits by non-covalent interactions, which play
a crucial role of metastasis in the cancer biology [19–21].
Although the roles of AR have emerged as a
pivotal factor in the regulation of cell motility across
diverse cancer, the effect of AR on migration of
chondrosarcoma cells still remains largely unknown. In
the present study, we probed intracellular signal pathways
involved in ­AR-induced integrin expression to regulate
cell migration in human chondrosarcoma cells.

but not αv, α5, β3, and β5 integrin expression (Fig. 1F). To
clarify whether JJ012 (S10) express higher level of α6β1
integrin than did JJ012 (S0), we examined the α6β1 integrin
level by qPCR and flow cytometry. The results indicated
that α6β1 integrin expressed level in JJ012 (S10), at both
mRNA and protein levels, was drastically higher than JJ012
(S0) (Fig. 1G-1H). In addition, AR-induced α6β1 integrin
expression was further validated by flow cytometry in
different chondrosarcoma cells. As shown in the left panel
of Fig. 1I, treatment of JJ012 cells with AR induced the
cell surface expression of α6β1 integrin. Similar results
were obtained in SW1353 cells (Fig. 1I, right panel). To
further confirm the effect of AR on migration through
α6β1 integrin, cells pre-treated with anti-α6β1 monoclonal
antibody markedly inhibited the AR-induced cell migration
(Fig. 1J). However, no significant inhibitory effect was
observed with the anti-αv monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1J).

AR induces α6β1 expression through the
Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway
To examine the mechanism by which AR induces
α6β1 expression, we directly measured the Ras activity
and Raf-1 phosphorylation in response to AR. The results
revealed that stimulation of cells to AR induced an increase
in Ras activity and phosphorylation of Raf-1 in a timedependent fashion (Fig. 2A-2B). Pretreatment of cells
with the Ras inhibitor attenuated phosphorylation of Raf1, suggesting that Ras serves as upstream regulator of Raf1-mediated signaling (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, AR-induced
cell migration was significantly reduced by inhibition
of Ras/Raf-1 signaling using either specific inhibitors or
siRNAs (Fig. 2D-2E). Knockdown efficiency of Ras or
Raf-1 was determined by Western blot (Fig. 2E, left). To
examine whether AR stimulates the expression of α6β1
integrin via Ras/Raf-1 signaling, cells were blocked the
pathway by either specific inhibitors or siRNAs. As shown
in Fig. 2F, AR-induced expression of α6β1 integrin at the
mRNA levels were strongly reduced in the presence of
inhibitors or siRNA against Ras and Raf-1. Pretreatment
of cells with manumycin A or GW5074 antagonized
AR-induced expression of α6β1 integrin at the protein
levels, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2G). Next, we
investigated whether AR is able to activate MEK/ERK that
is a critical downstream target of Raf-1. Stimulation of cells
with AR induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of MEK
and ERK (Fig. 3A). However, AR-induced phosphorylation
of MEK/ERK was markedly decreased by inhibiting
upstream signaling events using pharmacological inhibitors
(Fig. 3B-3C). To further evaluate the MEK1/ERK pathway
is able to induce the cell migration and α6β1 integrin
expression, we pretreated cells with PD98059 (10 μM) and
U0126 (10 μM), or transfected them with MEK1 and ERK
mutant. As shown in Fig. 3D-3E, AR-induced cell migration
and α6β1 integrin expression were greatly reduced when
the MEK/ERK pathway was inactivated. Furthermore,

RESULTS
AR-induced cell migration through
up-regulation of α6β1 integrin
To investigate whether AR is associated with
migration activity in human chondrosarcoma cells, we
first compared migration ability and the levels of AR
secretion between JJ012 (S0) and JJ012 (S10). As shown
in Fig. 1A, JJ012 (S10) cells had higher cell mobility and
migrated more easily to the underside of the Transwell
filters than did JJ012 (S0). Additionally, the levels of
secreted AR protein were significantly higher in JJ012
(S10) compared to JJ012 (S0) cells, as assessed by ELISA
(Fig. 1B). To clarify whether AR expression is involved
in migration of chondrosarcoma cells, we knocked down
AR expression by lentivirus-mediated delivery of AR
shRNA. Knockdown efficiency of AR was determined
by ELISA (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, silencing AR
expression resulted in decreased migration of JJ012 (S10)
cells. In addition to knockdown approach, we treated
JJ012 (S0) cells with exogenous AR to assess its effect
on cell migration. The results showed that AR enhanced
cell migration ability in a concentration-dependent manner
(Fig. 1E, left panel). This enhanced migration was also
observed with SW1353 (another chondrosarcoma cell line)
under the same conditions (Fig. 1E, right panel). In human
chondrosarcomas, numerous studies have shown that
increased integrin expression and signaling are implicated
in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis [1].
We therefore hypothesized that AR may promote cell
migration by increasing the expression of specific integrins.
The q-PCR analysis showed that AR induced α6 and β1

increased in the activity of AP-1 [22–24]. We therefore
hypothesized that AP-1 may be involved in AR-mediated
expression of α6β1 integrin in human chondrosarcoma
cells. Our data demonstrated that AR induced a
significant increase in c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 4A),
but this effect was attenuated by manumycin A, GW5074,

of the α6 or β1 integrin promoter, but this binding was
attenuated by manumycin A, GW5074, PD98059, and
U0126 (Fig.  4H). To further confirm that the Ras/Raf1/MEK1/ERK pathway signaling pathway involved in
AR-induced AP-1 activation, we performed promoter
activity assays using transient transfection with AP-1
promoter luciferase construct into cells. As shown in
Fig. 4I, treatment of cells with AR caused an increase
in AP-1-luciferase activity; however, pretreatment of
cells with manumycin A, GW5074, PD98059, and

that mice were injected with the same number of cells.
However, at day 60 after injection, tumor signals in the
lung were significantly reduced when AR expression
was knocked down (Fig. 5A). To confirm metastasis of
tumor cells into lungs, we isolated lung tissues and took
ex-vivo images (Fig. 5B). Next, we performed histological
analyses of lung tissues from mice using hematoxylineosin (H&E) or immunohistological (IHC) staining. The
results suggested that lung tissues from mice injected with

normal structure of lungs or dramatically reduced the
degree of lung metastatic nodules. However, lung tissues
from control group mice were heavily infiltrated (Fig. 5C,
H&E staining). Furthermore, an IHC analysis of the lungs
revealed knockdown of AR led to lower expression of
α6β1 integrin in metastatic nodules (Fig. 5C). Therefore,
our results suggested that AR is involved in up-regulation
of α6β1 integrin expression, which in turn promotes
cancer metastasis to the lung.

DISCUSSION

(Fig. 6B). In addition, the Pearson’s correlation showed
significantly positive correlations existed between AR
expression and integrin α6 (r2 = 0.8259, P < 0.0001),
AR expression and integrin β1 (r2 = 0.8087, P < 0.0001),
and integrin α6 and integrin β1 (r2 = 0.7512, P < 0.0001)
(Fig. 6C). Taken together, our data indicate that elevated
AR expression is associated with increased levels of α6β1
integrin and high histological grade of chondrosarcoma.

AR is a member of the EGF family, and its
increased expression has been reported in many cancers,
including colorectal cancer [6, 7], breast cancer [25, 26],
ovarian cancer [12, 27], pancreatic cancer [9, 28], lung
cancer [8, 29], liver cancer [14, 30], oral cancer [13].
AR has been considered as a new secreted marker for

exhibiting increased potential of cell invasion in cancer
[31, 32]. Several factors implicated in the induction of
AR expression have been demonstrated to promote
cell migration and tumor metastasis. For example, the
transcription factor, HOXB9, is overexpressed in breast
cancer cells inducing the expression of AR, resulting
in increased cell motility [33]. Conversely, Monad, a
component of R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, has been
shown to inhibit breast cancer cell invasion by degrading
AR mRNA [32]. Furthermore, a previous study has
shown that anterior gradient homolog 2 (AGR2) is
associated with increased tumor metastasis [34]. More
recent results, moreover, indicate that AGR2 is able to
induce AR expression [35]. Another study also found
that mitochondrial dysfunction has high AR expression
in hepatoma cells, leading to the facilitation of cell
migration [36].
Generation of the soluble forms of AR is
essentially mediated by the proteolytic activity of the
transmembrane proteinase ADAM-17 (a desintegrin and
metalloproteinase-17) also known as tumor-necrosis
factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) [3]. The ADAM17/TACE have been found to be key players for the
regulation of cell migration and invasion in cancer [37–39].
Conversely, inhibition of ADAM-17 can suppress cell
migration and invasion [40, 41].
In lung cancer, bone is a frequent target of
metastasis. A previously study discovered that AR is able
to activate expression of parathyroid hormone–related
protein (PTHrP) that is a causative factor contributing to
osteolytic metastases [42]. With regard to the roles of AR
in the relationship between tumor cells and nonneoplastic
cells in the cancer microenvironment, another study
also found that tumor-associated dendritic cells is able
to secrete high amounts of AR, which is responsible
for promoting lung cancer growth, migration, invasion,
and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, a
markedly elevated level of AR in lung cancer patients’
serum is also higher than those of healthy donors.
Neutralization of AR by specific Abs significantly
decreases the incidence of cancer development in mice
[29]. These results suggest that anti-AR is an attractive
strategy to target invasive cancer.
Due the observation that AR is highly expressed in
a variety of malignancies, insights into the mechanisms
related to the anti-tumor activity of AR targeted
therapy might help improve chondrosarcoma therapy. In
chondrosarcoma, the novel therapeutic strategies targeting
AR signaling by monoclonal antibodies, soluble receptor
protein, multikinase inhibitors, and RNA interference
could serve as therapeutic agents for clinical application
in humans. More recently, a study further demonstrated
that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
is the only marker suited for patient selection for
the trastuzumab plus pertuzumab-based regimen in HER2-

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

positive metastatic breast cancer [43]. Therefore, high AR
expression and its related receptors identify a subgroup
of patients who have a high probability of responding
to EGFR inhibition. It is necessary to establish whether
or not expression of AR and its receptor can be used for
tailoring treatment or for selecting patients for novel
treatment strategies.
Previous studies have indicated that integrins are
implicated in cellular migrations in chondrosarcoma
[44–46]. Notably, EGF and AR have been shown to
increase cell migration and invasion by enhancing
integrin expression [15–17, 47, 48]. However, the
detailed mechanism as to how AR-induced cell migration
in chondrosarcoma remains unclear. Here, we have
explored the signaling mechanism of AR in the regulation
of α6β1 integrin expression in human chondrosarcoma
cells. Collectively, these findings would provide a
better understanding of the mechanisms underlying AR
pathogenesis and can utilize this knowledge translationally
for novel treatment strategies for chondrosarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human chondrosarcoma cell line (JJ012) was
kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr Sean P Scully
(University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL).
The human chondrosarcoma cell line (SW1353) was
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Cells were cultured  in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM)/α-MEM  supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at
37°C in a humidified chamber in 5% CO2.

Cell migration assay
Cell migration was determined by using Transwell
culture inserts (8-μm pore size; Costar, NY) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells
(1.5 × 104  cells) suspended in 200 μl of serum-free
medium were seeded onto the upper chamber and 300 μl
of the same medium containing varying concentrations
of AR (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was placed in
the lower chamber. After overnight incubation, cells were
washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and
stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Cells remaining on the
upper surface of filter membrane were completely removed
by wiping with a cotton swab. Migrated cells were then
counted from six random fields under light microscope.

Establishment of migration-prone sublines
Subpopulations of JJ012 cells were selected
according to their differential migration ability using cell

dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression value.

culture insert system as described above. After overnight
migration, cells that penetrated through pores and migrated
to underside of filters were trypsinized and harvested for
a second round of selection. After 10 rounds of selection,
migration-prone subline was designated as JJ012 (S10).
Original cells were designated as JJ012 (S0) [49].

Flow cytometry
Aliquots of 1 × 106 cells collected and washed
once with PBS, then fixed with 70% ethanol overnight.
Fixed cells were washed twice by PBS and probed with
mouse monoclonal antibody specific to α6β1 integrin
(1:50; Chemicon/Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cells were
then washed again and incubated with fluorescein
isothiocyanate isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse
secondary IgG (1:100; Leinco Tec. Inc., St. Louis, MO)
for 45 min and analyzed by flow cytometry using FACS
Calibur and Cell-Quest software (BD Biosciences).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Conditioned medium was obtained from JJ012
cells grown in six-well plates. The concentrations of
AR in medium were measured using Quantikine ELISA
kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Lentivirus infection and shRNA knockdown

Ras pull-down assay

The pLKO.1-puro-based lentiviral vectors:
TRCN0000117995 (shAR#1) and TRCN0000420315
(shAR#2), and pLKO.1-shscramble were obtained from
National RNAi Core Facility at Academia Sinica, Taipei,
Taiwan. Recombinant lentiviruses were packaged as per
manufacturer’s instruction. Cultured cells were incubated
with lentiviral supernatants containing 8 μg/ml polybrene
for 24 h, replaced fresh medium and incubated for
another 48 h. For stable cell lines, cells were selected by
puromycin (5 μg/ml) [50].

Cells were treated with AR in a time-dependent
fashion. Activation of Ras (Ras-GTP) was detected using
the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 to pull down active
Ras (Ras Activation Assay Kit from Millipore, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Following separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were
transferred to membranes which were probed with an antiRAS antibody.

Western blotting

Oligonucleotide transfection

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease
inhibitor cocktail. Protein concentration was determined
by the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). Equal amount of total
protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes
were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and then
probed with primary antibodies. After washes in trisbuffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, membranes were
subsequently incubated with appropriate peroxidasecoupled secondary antibodies. Membranes were then
washed and bound antibodies were visualized using ECL
reagents (PerkinElmer, MA) and autoradiography.

To sequester downstream signaling, Cells were
transfected with MEK1 dominant-negative mutant
(gifts from Dr. W. M. Fu, National Taiwan University at
Taipei) or ERK2 dominant-negative mutant (gifts from
Dr. M. Cobb, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX).
To suppress gene expression, cells were transfected with
ON-TARGET plus siRNAs targeting Ras, Raf-1, and
c-Jun, and control from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette,
CO). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
is used to introduce oligonucleotide according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.

Quantitative real-time PCR

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(MDBio Inc., Taipei, Taiwan) and reverse transcribed
into cDNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase, Oligo
(dT), and dNTP Mix (Promega, Madison, WI) as per
manufacturer’s instructions. Synthesized cDNA (1 μg) was
used as template for quantitative PCR (qPCR) that was
conducted using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kits (Kapa
Biosystems, MA). Sequences for all target gene primers
and probes were purchased commercially (Applied
Biosystems). All primer used in qPCR were list in
Supplementary Table S1. qPCR assays were carried out
in triplicate using the StepOnePlus sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ChIP analysis was performed as described previously
[51]. Briefly, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde,
washed, and lysed. Cell lysates were sonicated to shear
DNA into smaller fragments. Protein-DNA complexes
were precipitated with anti-c-Jun antibody. After reverse
cross-link of protein-DNA complexs, free DNA was then
extracted with phenol-chloroform. Immunoprecipitated
DNA was amplified by PCR using the following
primers: primers 5′-AAGCGCTCCATAAACACCTG-3′
and 5′-AATTGTGGTTGCCGAGTAGC-3′ utilized
to amplify across α6 integrin promoter region;
primers 5′-ACGCAACTCACCAGGTTTTC-3′ and
11443

Statistics

5′-CTAGGAGGAGGCGGAGGAT-3′ utilized to amplify
across β1 integrin promoter region. PCR products
were resolved by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and
visualized by UV light.

All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical
comparison of two groups was performed using the
Student’s t-test. Statistical comparisons of more than two
groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance
with Bonferroni’s post hoc test. In all cases, P < 0.05 was
considered significant.

Luciferase reporter assay
Cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporter
gene constructs and β-galactosidase using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
At 24 h transfection, the cells were exposed to AR for
24 h or pre-treated with inhibitors for 30 min, followed
by treatment with AR for 24 h. Luciferase activity was
determined using the luciferase assay kit (Promega,
Madison, MA).

In vivo metastasis model

References

Four-week-old male nude mice were used and
randomly assigned to two groups (eight mice each group).
Cancer cells (JJ012 (S10)/Luc or JJ012 (S10)/shAR-Luc)
were resuspended in 100 μl of serum-free DMEM/
α-MEM and subcutaneously injected (5 × 106 cell per
mouse) into the lateral tail vein of mice. Lung metastasis
was monitored using an in vivo imaging system (Xenogen
IVIS imaging system). At Day 60, mice were sacrificed
by overdose with anesthetic. The lungs were then fixed
in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and subsequently
processed for IHC. All mice were handled in accordance
with the Animal Care and Use Guidelines of the China
Medical University (Taichung, Taiwan) under a protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
The human chondrosarcoma tissue array was
purchased from Biomax (Rockville, MD, USA; 6 cases
for normal cartilage, 24 cases for grade I chondrosarcoma,
9 cases for grade II chondrosarcoma, and 15 cases
for grade III chondrosarcoma). Fixed and paraffinembedded tissues were deparaffinized with xylene, and
rehydrated through a graded series of alcohols to water.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3%
hydrogen peroxide Heat-induced antigen retrieval was
carried out for all sections in 0.01 M sodium citrate
buffer, pH 6 at 95°C for 20 min. Human AR, integrin α6,
and integrin β1 antibodies were applied at a dilution of
1:200 and incubated at 4°C overnight. Bound antibodies
were detected by NovoLink Polymer Detection System
(Leica Microsystems, Newcastle, UK) and visualized
with the diaminobenzidine reaction. The sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin. IHC results were scored
by taking into account the percentage of positive detection
and intensity of the staining.
