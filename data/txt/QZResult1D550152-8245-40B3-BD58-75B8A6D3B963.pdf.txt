SUMMARY
We report the preclinical evaluation of PF-06463922, a potent and brain penetrant ALK/ROS1
inhibitor. Compared to other clinically available ALK inhibitors, PF-06463922 displayed superior
potency against all known clinically acquired ALK mutations, including the highly resistant
G1202R mutant. Furthermore, PF-06463922 treatment led to regression of EML4-ALK driven
brain metastases, leading to prolonged mouse survival, in a superior manner. Finally,
PF-06463922 demonstrated high selectivity and safety margins in a variety of preclinical studies.
These results suggest that PF-06463922 will be highly effective for the treatment of patients with
ALK-driven lung cancers, including those who relapsed on clinically available ALK inhibitors due
to secondary ALK kinase domain mutations and/or due to the failed control of brain metastases.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The clinical success of targeting oncogenic tyrosine kinases that are genetically altered
through activating mutations, gene translocations, or gene amplification has launched a new
era of cancer therapy (Weinstein, 2002). However, acquired resistance is a major limitation
to the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the clinic (Bagrodia et al., 2012;
Lackner et al., 2012; Rosenzweig, 2012). Crizotinib, a small molecule inhibitor of the MET,
ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases, is highly active in lung cancers harboring chromosomal
rearrangements of ALK or ROS1. In ALK-positive NSCLC patients, crizotinib
demonstrated an objective response rate of about 60% and a median progression free
survival of approximately 8 to 11 months (Camidge et al., 2012; Gerber and Minna, 2010;
Kwak et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2013; Solomon et al., 2014c). Similar to the experience with
other TKIs, several resistance mechanisms have been observed in patients who relapse on
crizotinib. These resistance mechanisms include secondary ALK kinase domain mutations
(Choi et al., 2010; Doebele et al., 2012; Katayama et al., 2011; Katayama et al., 2012;
Sasaki et al., 2011), ALK gene amplification (Doebele et al., 2012; Katayama et al., 2012;
Kim et al., 2013), bypass downstream signaling via EGFR (Katayama et al., 2012; Sasaki et
al., 2011; Tanizaki et al., 2012), KIT (Katayama et al., 2012), SRC (Crystal et al., 2014) or
IGF-1R (Lovly et al., 2014), and pharmacological resistance due to sub-optimal central
nervous system (CNS) exposure (Costa et al., 2011; Gandhi et al., 2013; Maillet et al., 2013;
Weickhardt et al., 2012). Roughly 30% of crizotinib refractory tumors have been shown to
harbor resistance mutations in the ALK kinase domain, including G1269A, L1196M,
C1156Y, L1152R, S1206Y, 1151Tins, G1202R and F1174L (Gainor and Shaw, 2013).
While crizotinib has shown clinical activity against brain metastases (Costa et al., 2013;
Kaneda et al., 2013; Kinoshita et al., 2013; Takeda et al., 2013), progression in the brain is
particularly common in relapsed patients (Costa et al., 2015; Weickhardt et al., 2012).

Author Manuscript

Recently, the 2nd generation ALK inhibitors ceritinib and alectinib have been approved for
use in crizotinib-relapsed ALK-positive NSCLC patients in the U.S., and for ALK-positive
crizotinibnaive NSCLC patients in Japan, respectively (Chen et al., 2013; Gadgeel et al.,
2014; Kinoshita et al., 2012; Shaw et al., 2014a). While both ALK inhibitors show efficacy
in these settings, resistance to both of these inhibitors has emerged. In the case of ceritinib,
relapsed tumors often express the ALK mutant G1202R (Friboulet et al., 2014). In the case
of alectinib, in addition to G1202R, two ALK resistance mutations (V1180L and I1171T)
have been observed (Ignatius Ou et al., 2014; Katayama et al., 2014). Some ALK mutants
such as G1202R confer high-level resistance to all clinically available ALK inhibitors
(Friboulet et al., 2014; Ignatius Ou et al., 2014; Shaw and Engelman, 2013). Both ceritinib
and alectinib have demonstrated activity in brain metastases of crizotinib-relapsed patients.
A phase 1/2 clinical trial of alectinib showed a CNS response rate of 52% (Gadgeel et al.,
2014). Despite the observed CNS activity with these agents, it remains common for patients
to relapse with CNS progression. A full understanding of the activity of clinically available
ALK inhibitors on brain metastases is still emerging, and we provide a glimpse into
mechanisms for their resistance here.
We initiated a drug discovery program with the goal of developing a next generation ALK
inhibitor that is more potent and selective than other known ALK inhibitors (including

current 2nd generation inhibitors), capable of inhibiting all known resistant ALK mutants
and able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to achieve therapeutic CNS drug
concentrations. PF-06463922, an ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor of ALK/ROS1,
was successfully discovered by the optimization of physicochemical properties guided by
structure based drug design (Johnson et al., 2014). Here we investigate the preclinical
antitumor activity of PF- 06463922 in both subcutaneous and intracranial tumor models.

RESULTS
PF-06463922 has sub-nanomolar biochemical and nanomolar cellular potency against
wildtype and crizotinib-resistant ALK mutants

Author Manuscript

PF-06463922 is a potent, reversible, ATP-competitive inhibitor of recombinant ALK kinase
(Fig. S1A). In biochemical assays, PF-06463922 inhibited the catalytic activity of
recombinant human wild-type ALK with a mean Ki of <0.07 nM (Fig. 1A). In addition,
PF-06463922 showed a range of mean Ki values of <0.1 nM to 0.9 nM against the following
crizotinib-resistant ALK mutants: L1196M, G1269A, 1151Tins, F1174L, C1156Y, L1152R,
and S1206Y. PF-06463922 was more potent than crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib against
wild type ALK in biochemical studies (Fig. 1B). In addition to its high potency against
ALK, PF-06463922 has previously demonstrated sub-nanomolar cell potency against ROS1
(Zou et al., 2015) and demonstrated >100-fold selectivity vs. non-target kinases, relative to
the ALKL1196M gatekeeper mutant, for >95% of the 206 kinases tested (Johnson et al.,
2014).

Author Manuscript

To directly compare the potencies of PF-06463922, crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib in cell
assays, NIH3T3 and Ba/F3 cells were engineered to express either wild-type or the
crizotinib-resistant mutants 1151Tins, L1152R, C1156Y, L1196M, G1269A, G1202R,
F1174L, or S1206Y (Fig. 1C, Fig. S1B and Table S1). We observed a strong correlation
between drug concentrations required to inhibit ALK phosphorylation and those needed to
block ALK dependent cell proliferation (Fig. 1C). PF-06463922 was the most potent
inhibitor against all clinically relevant crizotinib-, certinib- and/or alectinib-resistant ALK
mutants. PF-06463922 showed strong ALK phosphorylation potency against the L1196M
(IC50 = 15–43 nM) and G1269A (IC50 = 14–80 nM) ALK mutants, which are two of the
most frequently detected crizotinib-resistant mutations observed in the clinic (Doebele et al.,
2012; Kim et al., 2013). Furthermore, PF-06463922 demonstrated potent ALK
phosphorylation activity against the 1151Tins (IC50 = 38–50 nM) and G1202R (IC50 = 77–
113 nM) ALK mutants that confer a high-level of resistance to all 2nd generation ALK
inhibitors (Katayama et al., 2012; Shaw and Engelman, 2013).

PF-06463922 inhibits ALK-dependent cell growth in vitro
The activity of PF-06463922 on cell viability and intracellular signaling was examined in
H3122 and H2228 ALK-positive lung cancer cell lines. In addition, we examined H3122
cells engineered to overexpress the crizotinib-resistant ALK mutants, G1269A or L1196M.
Similar to the Ba/F3 cell model, in these cell lines PF-06463922 was greater than 30-fold
more potent than crizotinib with respect to suppressing ALK-dependent signaling and
inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis (Fig. 2A–E Fig. S2A–D and Table S1).

Furthermore, the cell viability of in vitro-derived alectinib-resistant H3122 cells, which
contain an endogenous V1180L ALK mutation (Katayama et al., 2014), was sensitive to
PF-06463922 via potent inhibition of ALK signaling (Fig. 2F and S2E).

Author Manuscript

The efficacy of PF-06463922 was also examined in cell lines derived from patients with
acquired resistance to crizotinib, ceritinib or alectinib. These cells lines, SNU2535,
MGH021-5 and MGH056-1, harbor endogenous EML4-ALKG1269A, SQSTM1-ALKG1202R
or EML4-ALKI1171T mutations, respectively. PF-06463922 exhibited significantly greater
cell growth inhibitory potency in these cell lines compared to crizotinib. Cell growth IC50
values for PF-06463922 were 47 nM, 63 nM and 23 nM, respectively, compared with 3240
nM, 1046 nM and 271 nM, respectively, for crizotinib (Fig. 2G–I). These cell growth IC50
values correlated closely with the drugs’ abilities to inhibit ALK phosphorylation and
downstream signaling in these cells (FS2F–H). Overall, in both the patient-derived and
engineered cell lines, PF-06463922 consistently showed greater potency in inhibiting ALK
phosphorylation and cell viability compared to clinically available ALK inhibitors.
PF-06463922 exhibits potent antitumor efficacy in vivo, and its pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic relationship in these models

Author Manuscript

PF-06463922 was evaluated for its efficacy against subcutaneous (S.C.) growth of parental
H3122 EML4-ALKWT and engineered H3122 EML4-ALKL1196M, EML4-ALKG1269A and
NIH- 3T3 EML4-ALKG1202R tumors (Fig. 3A–D). In these experiments, PF-06463922 was
administered by subcutaneous pump infusion, which better mimics the predicted human PK
profile than oral dosing in mice (data not shown). Treatment with PF-06463922 led to a
dose-dependent antitumor effect ranging from tumor growth inhibition (TGI) to tumor
regression. The effect on tumor growth was consistent with its ability to dose-dependently
inhibit ALK phosphorylation. A maximal effect (Emax) of > 95% inhibition of ALK
phosphorylation was achieved in each of the models, and this resulted in tumor regression
ranging from 35% to 77% (Fig. 3 and Table S2). Of note, PF-06463922 significantly
inhibited tumor growth in crizotinib-resistant models harboring mutant ALK, including the
most resistant G1202R mutant.

Author Manuscript

A simple direct response pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling analysis
(Mager et al., 2003) was conducted to elucidate the relationship between PF-06463922
plasma concentration, inhibition of ALK phosphorylation and suppression of tumor growth.
The Hill equation showed reasonable fits for both inhibition of ALK phosphorylation and
antitumor efficacy (Fig. S3A–S3D). The PK, PD, TGI and Hill equation parameters of
PF-06463922 from these studies are summarized in Tables S2 and S3, and the efficacious
concentrations (Ceff) derived from the Hill function analyses are summarized in Table S4.
To summarize, the Ceffs for tumor stasis (100% TGI) were determined to be 6.5 nM in the
H3122 EML4-ALKWT tumor model, 38 nM in the H3122 EML4-ALKG1269A model, 68 nM
in the H3122 EML4-ALKL1196M model and 165 nM in the 3T3 EML4-ALKG1202R model.
The estimated effective concentrations (EC50) for inhibiting ALK phosphorylation were
comparable to the Ceff values for tumor stasis of each corresponding ALK fusion (Table
S4). The Ceff (68 nM free) determined for the H3122 EML4-ALKL1196M model with
PF-06463922 administered by infusion is similar to the Ceff (51 nM free) determined using

the oral route (Yamazaki et al., 2014). The Ceffs for maximum antitumor response for
PF-06463922 correlated closely with the estimated EC90 values for ALK phosphorylation
inhibition in these tumors (Fig. S3A–S3D and Table S4).

Author Manuscript

An oral dosing study in the H3122-EML4-ALKL1196M model demonstrated significant
tumor regression (35%) and greater than 95% inhibition of ALK phosphorylation in the 10
mg/kg/day BID group. The antitumor efficacy of the 10 mg/kg/day BID oral dosing
schedule was similar to that of the 30 mg/kg/day QD group (33% regression), and superior
to the 10 mg/kg/day QD group (3% tumor regression) (Fig. S3E). The 10 mg/kg/day BID
group had lower unbound plasma Cmax (maximal plasma concentration) (392 nM) than
either the 10 mg/kg/day QD (1,636 nM) or the 30 mg/kg/day QD (3,193 nM) groups,
indicating that the antitumor efficacy of PF06463922 was not driven by Cmax in this model
(Table S2). Collectively, these results indicate that near complete inhibition of ALK
phosphorylation (> 95%) with prolonged duration during the dosing interval by
PF-06463922 is necessary to achieve maximal tumor regression, and PF-06463922 is able to
achieve this activity at a relatively low dose.
PF-06463922 drives superior tumor growth inhibition in vivo compared to crizotinib

Author Manuscript

The in vivo efficacy of PF-06463922 was directly compared to crizotinib in engineered
H3122 models and patient-derived cell lines. Consistent with in vitro data, PF-06463922
showed superior efficacy compared to crizotinib in tumor xenografts derived from H3122
EML4-ALKWT (Fig. S4A), H3122 EML4-ALKL1196M (Fig. 4A) and H3122 EML4ALKG1269A cells (Fig. S4B). In parallel with tumor growth, PF-06463922 inhibited ALKmediated signal transduction in tumor tissues collected 3 hours following the final dose of a
4-day treatment regimen to a greater extent than crizotinib. Specifically, ALK, AKT, ERK,
STAT3 and S6 phosphorylation were significantly decreased by PF-06463922 in the
respective H3122 EML4-ALK models (Fig. S4C D and E). This data corresponded to dosedependent induction of cleaved caspase 3 levels measured in H3122 EML4-ALKL1196M
tumor samples from mice treated with 3 and 10 mg/kg/day of PF-06463922 (Fig. 4B). Of
note, in H3122 EML4-ALKWT tumor bearing mice, PF-06463922 showed similar efficacy
in inhibiting tumor growth and ALK phosphorylation compared to alectinib (Fig. S4A and
S4C).

Author Manuscript

Two ALK-positive patient derived cell lines were also used to evaluate the in vivo antitumor
efficacy of PF-06463922 against wild type EML4-ALK. MGH051 (EML4-ALKWT) (Fig.
4C) was derived from a crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive NSCLC patient (Friboulet et al.,
2014). MGH006 (EML4-ALKWT) (Fig. S4F) was derived from a crizotinib-naive ALKpositive NSCLC patient (Katayama et al., 2012). Oral administration of PF-06463922
potently suppressed ALK phosphorylation and led to substantial tumor regression of these
xenograft models (Fig. S4G and H).
The antitumor efficacy of PF-06463922 in xenograft models was durable. PF-06463922
suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth longer than 170 days in both MGH051 (EML4ALKWT) (Fig. 4C) and H3122-EML4-ALKG1269A (Fig. 4D) and models at drug
concentrations predicted to be clinically achievable. Moreover, PF-06463922 induced tumor
regression in mice bearing MGH051 tumors that relapsed on crizotinib (Fig. 4C).

PF-06463922 induced superior regression of intracranial EML4-ALK tumors and prolonged
mouse survival compared to other clinically-available ALK inhibitors
Nearly 50% of ALK-positive NSCLC patients undergoing crizotinib treatment exhibit brain
metastasis as the first site of disease progression, and in nearly 80% of these patients
systemic disease is under control (Camidge, 2013; Solomon et al., 2014b). The
physicochemical properties of PF-06463922 were specifically optimized to maximize its
CNS availability. PF- 06463922 demonstrated 21% to 31% free brain drug exposure relative
to free plasma concentration in non-tumor bearing rats and dogs, and is predicted to
penetrate the intact bloodbrain barrier (BBB) in humans (Johnson et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

To investigate the antitumor efficacy of PF-06463922 in a NSCLC brain metastasis model,
we conducted intracranial xenograft studies with EML4-ALK-positive tumor models
containing either wild-type EML4-ALK (H3122 or MGH006 cells) or the ALKL1196M
gatekeeper mutation (H3122 EML4-ALKL1196M cells). Tumor cells were engineered to
express either firefly luciferase or gaussia luciferase (Gluc) in order to allow noninvasive
monitoring of tumor growth in vivo by either whole-body in vivo imaging systems (IVIS) or
tail-vein blood Gluc activity measurement, respectively.

Author Manuscript

As shown by either MRI (Fig. 5A,B), IVIS (Fig. S5A–C) images, or blood Gluc activity
measurements over time (Fig. 5C), PF-06463922 demonstrated significant antitumor activity
against H3122 EML4-ALKWT brain metastases that was superior to either crizotinib or
alectinib. In subcutaneous studies, H3122 (EML4-ALKwt) tumors displayed similar
sensitivity to PF- 06463922 and alectinib (Fig.S4A). However, while H3122 brain
metastases relapsed between 40 and 120 days after alectinib initiation, PF-06463922
treatment suppressed tumor growth in all mice for the duration of the experiment (160 days).
Interestingly, shifting the alectinib-relapsed mice to PF-06463922 induced a second tumor
response in those animals, demonstrating that PF-06463922 has superior intracranial
efficacy compared with alectinib (Fig. 5C). The suppression in brain metastasis growth by
PF-06463922 was consistent with better suppression of ALK phosphorylation (Fig. 5D).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis indicated a significant reduction in the Ki67-positive
tumor cell number and mitotic index in brain xenografts from mice within the 10 mg/kg/day
BID treatment group (Fig. S5C, S5D).
Consistent with the H3122 EML4-ALKWT brain metastasis study, PF-06463922 dosedependently regressed H3122 EML4-ALKL1196M brain metastases at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/
day, corresponding to median free brain drug concentrations of 35, 55 and 100 ng/g
respectively (Fig. S5E and F). In contrast, control-treated mice were euthanized, on average,
11 days after treatment initiation due to declining health attributed to tumor burden.

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized the superior inhibition of brain metastasis growth, attributed to better ALK
kinase inhibition, was due to two factors – the enhanced potency of PF-06463922 and/or its
increased ability to cross the BBB. To determine which mechanism attributed to its efficacy
in our brain metastasis model, we tested an ALK inhibitor, PF-06439015, that possesses 1.5fold greater potency than PF-06463922 but has poor CNS penetration (Huang et al., 2014;
Johnson et al., 2014). Continued subcutaneous infusion of PF-06463922 (6–12 mg/kg/day)
suppressed brain tumor growth better than PF-06439015 (36 mg/kg/day) (Fig. S5B). PK

analysis from these studies indicated that the brain free fraction of PF-06463922 (0.30 ±
0.13) relative to free plasma concentration was > 4-fold higher than that of PF-06439015
(0.07 ± 0.02) in mice bearing intracranial tumors. Similarly, better growth delay in the
H3122 EML4-ALKL1196M brain metastasis model was attributed to better drug penetration,
as PF-06439015 failed to control their growth as brain tumor drug concentrations only
reached 9.5 ng/g (Fig. S5E and F).

Author Manuscript

Patient-derived MGH006 cells expressing Gluc were equally sensitive to crizotinib and PF06463922 in subcutaneous studies (Fig. S4F). When grown in the brain, however,
PF-06463922 suppressed MGH006 tumor growth longer than crizotinib, leading to a
significant improvement in survival (Fig. 5E and F). Crizotinib delayed MGH006 brain
metastasis growth roughly 3-fold compared with control-treated mice, however all mice
were euthanized within 45 days after treatment initiation due to neurological defects
consistent with large CNS tumors. At this time point, brain metastases from PF-06463922treated mice were barely detectable, and much smaller than when treatment was initiated.
Consistent with their effects on brain metastasis growth, PF-06463922 achieved better
suppression of ALK phosphorylation compared with crizotinib (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, we
observed a reduction in total ALK levels in both treatment groups, but particularly after
treatment with PF-06463922. It has been previously reported that HSP90 binding to ALKfusion proteins in cells is disrupted by crizotinib treatment (Taipale et al., 2013). This
disruption may contribute to the reduction in total ALK-fusion protein levels.
PF-06463922 demonstrated a broad therapeutic window in preclinical studies

Author Manuscript

PF-06463922 demonstrated antitumor efficacy in both subcutaneous and brain orthotopic
xenograft models harboring oncogenic ALK fusions containing either wild-type ALK or
crizotinib-resistant ALK mutants at pharmacologically relevant doses. PF-06469322 was
well tolerated in mice (lack of significant weight loss) at all doses used in our studies
(Fig.S6). This safety profile is also reflected by in vitro cell assays. For example, compared
with other ALK inhibitors, PF-06463922 demonstrated superior activity against ALK-fusion
transformed Ba/F3 cells compared with other ALK inhibitors (Table S1), while displaying
less toxicity to parental Ba/F3 cells (IC50 >10 µM) (Fig. 6A). This finding is likely due to its
high level of selectivity (Johnson et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

The lack of toxicity of PF-06463922 in Ba/F3 cells, in combination with its superior
potency, suggests that this compound could achieve a strong preclinical safety margin. The
preclinical safety profile of PF-06463922 was characterized through single- and repeat-dose
studies of up to 1 month in duration in rats and dogs, as well as safety pharmacology and
genetic toxicity studies. The nonclinical safety findings related to PF-06463922 were
identified at reasonable exposure margins above the efficacious concentration, and represent
toxicities that can be monitored and are reversible following a one month treatment free
period in rat and dog studies. PF-06463922 achieved a greater than 100-fold therapeutic
index when comparing its Ceff (tumor stasis) in the EML4-ALK subcutaneous tumor
growth model to its maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in both rats and dogs. The Ceffs derived
from our in vivo studies are summarized in Table S4. It is worth mentioning that
PF-06463922 achieved a maximal effect for either ALK target inhibition or tumor

regression in each of the tested efficacy models at exposure levels that are well below the
MTD generated from one-month dog or rat safety studies (Fig. 6B). Since PF-06463922 is a
brain penetrable compound, the potential for adverse CNS effects were tested in repeated
dose safety studies as well as in the rat contextual renewal model. No CNS-mediated signals
were observed in these studies. Furthermore, the functional observation battery (FOB)
assessment was included in the one-month repeated dose study in the rat (data not shown).
FOB is a series of noninvasive observational and interactive measures of CNS and automatic
system function (e.g., body temperature, pupil response, gait, locomotor activity). No FOB
effects were identified, despite achieving plasma exposures 60-fold higher than the predicted
minimal efficacious exposure in humans (51 nM free), defined as the free compound
concentration needed to achieve tumor stasis in the H3122 EML4-ALKL1196M model.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

The discovery of oncogenic ALK fusions and the development of ALK targeted therapies,
like crizotinib, have transformed the course of disease for patients with ALK-driven cancers,
particularly those with NSCLC. Patients derive significant benefit from either crizotinib or
second-generation inhibitors alectinib or ceritinib. However, the majority of patients
invariably relapse, and limited treatment options remain after relapse.

Author Manuscript

Here we report preclinical data on PF-06463922, a next generation ALK inhibitor that is
currently in a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT01970865) for ALK or ROS1 fusion-positive
NSCLC. In a variety of different ALK inhibitor resistant models, PF-06463922
demonstrated broad activity across ALK resistant mutations, including G1202R that is the
most refractory mutation identified to date. G1202R has rarely been reported in the setting
of crizotinib resistance, but is emerging as a common resistant mutation to the 2nd
generation ALK inhibitors ceritinib (Friboulet et al., 2014) or alectinib (Ignatius Ou et al.,
2014). This is consistent with our preclinical studies showing that G1202R confers broad
resistance to 1st and 2nd generation ALK inhibitors.

Although crizotinib has shown clinical activity against brain metastases, the CNS is a
common site of relapse for patients on crizotinib (Costa et al., 2013; Costa et al., 2015;
Solomon et al., 2014a; Solomon et al., 2014c). Mechanisms of resistance in the CNS to
crizotinib have not been studied in detail, but one plausible mechanism is the inability of
crizotinib to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the CNS compartment. Consistent with
this notion, a case report showed low levels of crizotinib in the cerebrospinal fluid of a
patient who had relapsed with brain metastases (Costa et al., 2011). Poor brain penetration
of crizotinib is likely due to its high efflux by Pglycoprotein (PGP) (Johnson et al., 2014).
Second generation ALK inhibitors have shown moderate CNS activity, including patients
who have relapsed on crizotinib (Gadgeel et al., 2014). Similar to crizotinib, ceritinib is a
PGP substrate and has limited brain penetration (Shaw et al., 2014b), and therefore
responses to ceritinib likely reflect its increased potency. Alectinib, on the other hand, is not
a PGP substrate and is associated with an intracranial response rate of 52% (Gadgeel et al.,
2014). Nevertheless, patients treated with either ceritinib or alectinib still relapse with brain
metastases, highlighting the need for a more potent inhibitor with increased CNS availability
that, ideally, is not a substrate for PGP. PF-06463922 was specifically designed and

optimized to efficiently penetrate the BBB, and as a result it showed ~30% CNS availability
in multiple preclinical species. We successfully mimicked the clinical situation in mouse
models, and showed that ALK fusion tumors, sensitive to crizotinib when growing subQ,
were resistant when growing in the brain parenchyma. Furthermore, PF-06463922
demonstrated superior efficacy to after alectinib relapse in our murine models of brain
metastasis. PF- 06463922 regressed intracranial tumors at doses much lower than the MTD
in our preclinical studies. In contrast, a potent ALK inhibitor with low CNS availability
(6%) failed to sustain tumor growth inhibition in the same intracranial tumor model,
suggesting penetration into the brain metastasis plays a major role in the activity of
PF-06463922. While PF-06463922 provides hope that it will overcome brain metastases that
develop in patients who relapse to 1st and 2nd generation ALK inhibitors, data from the
ongoing Phase 1 study of PF-06463922 will be necessary to evaluate the CNS activity of
PF-06463922 in humans, as preclinical studies may not predict brain penetration in humans.

Author Manuscript

The potency and safety profile, in combination with the penetration into the CNS, of PF06463922 provides an opportunity to address both acquired and pharmacological
mechanisms of drug resistance. Preclinical studies suggest a favorable preclinical safety
window for PF-06463922 consistent with the ability to treat patients with drug exposures
high enough to inhibit the most recalcitrant G1202R mutant and to reach therapeutic levels
in the CNS. Preclinical studies are not always capable of predicting clinical toxicity, so data
from the ongoing Phase 1 study of PF-06463922 will be critical in understanding the safety
margin that PF-06463922 can achieve in humans.

Author Manuscript

The most immediate impact of PF-06463922 may be on patients that have failed previous
ALK TKIs, not only in systemic disease but also with brain metastases. Given that
PF-06463922 is the most potent and brain penetrable inhibitor that we tested in our models,
whether it should be used as frontline treatment is an intriguing question that awaits clinical
investigation. For example, could the frontline use of PF-06463922 lead to more durable
responses than sequential therapy in the clinic, as suggested by the sustained responses seen
with PF-06463922 in preclinical studies? Finally, if the safety and efficacy of PF-06463922
are confirmed in the clinic, PF-06463922 may serve as an ideal backbone for combination
therapies aimed at overcoming and even preventing the emergence of resistant clones.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Enzyme Assays and compounds

Author Manuscript

Recombinant human wild-type and mutant ALK kinase domain proteins (amino acids
1093-1411) were produced in house using baculoviral expression, pre-activated via autophosphorylation with MgATP, and assayed for kinase activity using a microfluidic mobility
shift assay. The reactions contained 1.3 nM wild-type ALK or 0.2–10 nM mutant ALK
(appropriate to produce 15–20% phosphorylation of peptide substrate after 1-h reaction), 3
µM 5-FAM-KKSRGDYMTMQIG-CONH2, 5 mM MgCl2 and the Km-level of ATP in 25
mM Hepes, pH 7.1. The Ki values were calculated by fitting the % conversion to a
competitive inhibition equation (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
PF-06463922 and PF-06439015 were synthesized as described in Huang, Q. 2014 (Huang et
al., 2014) and Johnson, T., 2014 (Johnson et al., 2014), respectively; PF-02341066 as

specifically optimized to maximize CNS availability by controlling molecular weight,
lipophilicity, and hydrogen bond donor (HBD) count.
Cell Culture and Reagents

Author Manuscript

NCI-H3122 human NSCLC cells were licensed from National Institute of Health (NIH)
(Rockville, MD). Karpas299 and NIH-3T3 cells were purchased from American Tissue
Culture Corporation (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). BaF3 cells were obtained from DSMZ
(Germany). NCIH3122 and NCI-H2228 are human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines
harboring the EML4-ALK fusion protein variant 1 (V1) and variant 3 (V3a/b), respectively.
The SNU2535, MGH056-1 and MGH021-5 NSCLC cell lines were derived from crizotinib,
alectinib or ceritinib-relapsed patients and harbor the mutant ALK fusion proteins G1269A,
G1202R or I1171T, respectively. MGH006, MGH051-1, MGH021-5 and MGH056-1 were
maintained as previously described (Friboulet et al., 2014; Katayama et al., 2014; Katayama
et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013). Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies,
Inc. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5–10% CO2.
Engineered Cell Line Generation
The target of interest was first cloned into the retroviral vector pMSCV puro or
pMSCVhygro. The retroviruses carrying recombinant genes were produced in 293T cells by
co-transfection with the pMSCV vectors and the packaging plasmid pCL10A1. The
retroviral supernatants were used to transduce NCI-H3122, NIH3T3 or BaF3 parental cells
and pooled populations were selected with 2 g/ml puromycin or 50 g/ml hygromycin for 5
days.

Cell Proliferation Assay

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in growth media with 0.5% serum and incubated
overnight. Compounds were diluted in media without serum, added to the cells, incubated
for one hour, and then removed by aspirating the media by vacuum suction. Cell lysates
were generated and the phospho-ALK (Tyr1604) levels were determined by using the
PathScan® Phospho-ALK (Tyr1604) Chemiluminescent Sandwich ELISA Kit (Cell
Signaling, Cat#: 7020) or PathScan® Total ALK Chemiluminescent Sandwich ELISA Kit
(Cell Signaling, Cat#: 7084) as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. The IC50 values
were calculated by concentration-response curve fitting utilizing a four-parameter analytical
method. This phospho-ALK ELISA assay was also used to determine phosphor-ALK levels
in the protein extracts from xenograft tumor samples.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in growth media containing 10% FBS and cultured
overnight at 37°C. The following day, serial dilutions of PF-06463922 or appropriate
controls were added to the designated wells, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 72 hours.
A Cell Titer Glo assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was then performed to determine the
relative cell numbers. IC50 values were calculated by concentration-response curve fitting
utilizing a four-parameter analytical method.

IC50 values were calculated by concentration-response curve fitting utilizing a fourparameter analytical method.
Animals

Author Manuscript

5–8 weeks old female nu/nu mice were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA).
Animals were maintained under clean room conditions in sterile filter top cages with AlphaDri bedding and housed on HEPA-filtered ventilated racks. Animals received sterile rodent
chow and water ad libitum. All animal procedures were performed in compliance with the
Institute for Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and the Public Health Service Policy on Human Care of Laboratory Animals. Experiments
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Pfizer La Jolla and by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital.
Drug administration

Author Manuscript

In all the tumor xenograft studies, the compound of interest was administered either orally at
5 to 10 mL/kg utilizing the sterile 20G feeding needles (popper and sons, inc., NY) or via a
subcutaneous Alzet mini-pump (DURECT Corporation, Cupertino, CA) infusion.
Subcutaneous tumor model
The cells were supplemented with 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose CA) to facilitate
tumor take. Cells (5 × 106 in 100 uL) were implanted subcutaneously (S.C.) into the hind
flank region of the mouse and allowed to grow to the designated size prior to the
administration of compound for each experiment. Tumor size was determined by
measurement with an electronic calipers and tumor volume was calculated as the product of
its length × width2 × 0.4.
Intracranial tumor model

Author Manuscript

For injection into the brain, the head of the mouse was fixed with a stereotactic apparatus
and the skull over the left hemisphere of the brain was exposed via skin incision. Using a
high-speed air-turbine drill (CH4201S; Champion Dental Products) with a burr tip size of
0.5 mm in diameter, three sides of a square (2.5 mm in length, each side) were drilled
through the skull until a bone flap became loose. Using blunt tweezers, the bone flap was
pulled back, exposing the brain parenchyma. 100,000 cancer cells, diluted in 1 µL PBS,
were stereotactically injected into the left frontal lobe of the mice. The bone flap was then
placed back into position in the skull and sealed using histocompatible cyanoacrylate glue,
and the skin atop the skull was sutured closed. Brain metastatic tumor growth was measured

through the use of Gaussia luciferase (Gluc), an in vivo secreted reporter expressed by tumor
cells and measured in the peripheral blood. In similar models, the blood Gluc activity
directly correlated with tumor volume (Kodack et al., 2012).

Ex Vivo Target Modulation (PK/PD) Studies

MRI images were acquired with a Bruker 7.0T scanner with an Avance II console using a 72
mm ID linear birdcage resonator for transmission and a two element surface coil array for
local reception. Pre- and post-contrast T1 weighted fast spin echo images were acquired.
While in the scanner, the temperature and respiratory trace of each mouse monitored
continuously. The isoflurane/oxygen mixture (1.4–2.0%) was adjusted based on the
respiratory rate. The mouse temperature was stabilized by forced air heating with automatic
feedback from a rectal temperature probe. Prior to post-contrast scans, mice were injected
with gadolinium. Injections were timed such image acquisition coincided with a period of
stable tumor contrast as determined in a pilot study. Tumor volume was calculated by
manual segmentation of T1 weighted images using imageJ software.

Author Manuscript

For tissue and plasma processing for PK/PD studies, mice were humanely euthanized, blood
and brain tissue samples were collected for PK analysis, and tumors were resected for PD
analysis. Plasma and brain samples were analyzed for PF-06463922 concentration using
LCMS analysis. Resected tumors were snap frozen and pulverized on a liquid nitrogen
cooled cryomortar and pestle, and lysed in cold 1X Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling
Technologies, Boston MT). Proteins were extracted from tumor lysate and protein
concentrations were determined using a BSA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The level of
phosphorylated ALK in each tumor sample was determined using the capture ELISA or
Western blotting methods.
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting method was also used to determine relative kinase phosphorylation status
and total protein levels in cells and tumor tissues for the protein of interest. Extracted protein
samples from cells or tumor lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon
membranes, and immunoblotting hybridizations for the proteins of the interest were
performed using the corresponding antibodies. Phospho-ERK (T202/Y204), ERK, S6,
phospho S6, phospho-AKT (S473 and T308), AKT, phospho-ALK (Y1282/1283), and ALK
antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. GAPDH was purchased from
Millipore.

Statistics
Sample size for in vivo tumor growth inhibition (TGI) studies was estimated to be around
n=8–12 per group to ensure a 80% power to capture 70% TGI in an 1-sided test based on
variability estimate from historical data. Animals were randomized into different treatment
groups stratified on their initial tumor size, so the average tumor size for each group is
similar at baseline. Standard inclusion/exclusion criteria were used where animals are only
excluded in rare occasions (such as death) after randomization. Investigators were not

SIGNIFICANCE
Though the development of ALK inhibitors has changed the course of treatment in
NSCLC patients, tumors invariably relapse. Here, we demonstrate the superior properties
of the next generation ALK inhibitor PF-06463922 compared with clinically available
ALK inhibitors. PF- 06463922 addresses two major mechanisms of clinical relapse, ALK
resistance mutations and brain metastasis. Superior potency, selectivity and
physicochemical properties of PF-06462922 are reflected in its ability to achieve potent
inhibition of all tested ALK resistance mutations, to penetrate the CNS and regress brain
metastasis, while having robust safety margins in preclinical studies. PF-06463922 has
the potential to treat ALK-driven cancer in both the refractory setting as well as in the
frontline setting.
