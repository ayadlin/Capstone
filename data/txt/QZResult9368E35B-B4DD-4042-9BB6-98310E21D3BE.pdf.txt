Abstract:

Tetraploidization is believed to promote genome instability and tumorigenesis.
Whether tetraploids per se are intrinsically unstable and transforming remain
incompletely understood. In this report, tetraploidization was induced with cell
fusion using mouse fibroblasts. Due to the unequal segregation of chromosomes
during multipolar mitosis, the majority of cells were eliminated by p53-dependent
mechanisms after tetraploidization. The rare tetraploid fibroblasts that were able to
undergo bipolar mitosis remained chromosomally stable and nontransformed over
many generations. Suppression of p53 functions during tetraploidization, either by
RNA interference or by using p53-deficient mouse fibroblasts, produced cells that
were chromosomally unstable. They were fast growing and displayed anchorageindependent growth in soft agar. In contrast, impairment of p53 functions after
tetraploids were established was ineffective in triggering chromosomal instability
and transformation. Collectively, these results are consistent with a model that
during early stages of tetraploidization, the lack of p53 promotes the survival of
chromosomally unstable sub-tetraploids, leading to transformation. Once tetraploids
are established, however, p53 is not essential for maintaining chromosome stability.

INTRODUCTION

displaying dynamic karyotypic changes including gain
or loss of whole chromosomes. Tetraploid cells are
commonly found in early stages of tumors. Notable
examples include Barrett’s esophagus [5,6] and cervical
carcinoma [7]. Several studies with yeast [8,9] and
mammalian cells [10,11] have provided evidence that
tetraploidization increases chromosome instability.
Moreover, tetraploidy may be an intermediate state in
transformation. For example, it was found that during
transformation of epithelial cells from mouse salivary
glands, tetraploid cells appeared before they undergo a
period of chromosome instability and loss [11]. Many
viruses can induce tetraploidy via cell fusions. Evidence
from in vitro and animal models also suggest a link
between cell fusion induced by viruses (which then
caused tetraploidy) and cancer [12].
A seminal study by Fujiwara et al. (2005) indicates
that tetraploids can be generated by transiently blocking
cytokinesis in p53-null mouse mammary epithelial cells.
Importantly, tetraploidization promotes aneuploidy
and tumorigenesis [10]. The presence of p53 normally

Limiting genome replication to once per cell cycle
is critical for maintaining genome stability. A growing
body of evidence indicates that polyploidization can
initiate chromosomal instability and transformation [1].
While rereplication is stringently prevented in the normal
cell cycle, multiple rounds of genome reduplication,
called endoreduplication, occur in cell types such as
megakaryocytes, trophoblasts, and plant cells [2].
Polyploidization is also believed to be an essential step
during evolution. In his seminal work, Ohno proposed that
whole genome duplication provides the primary source of
redundant genes for new evolutionary opportunities [3].
Likewise, the multistep progression of cancer – including
initiation, progression, heterogeneity, and drug resistance
– is a product of evolutionary processes [4]. The extra
sets of chromosomes after polyploidization may act as a
reservoir of genetic materials to allow clonal evolution
of tumor.
The majority of cancer cells are highly aneuploid,

suppresses the generation of tetraploid cells, presumably
by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [13].
Several processes that cause tetraploidization, including
chromosome nondisjunction (which promotes cleavage
furrow regression) [14], persistent telomere damage
[15], and virus infection-mediated cell fusion (called
heterokaryon) [16] are believed to be important to
tumorigenesis. These and other studies provide strong
evidence of the importance of tetraploidization as an early
step in tumorigenesis.
A p53-dependent “tetraploidy checkpoint” has
been proposed to prevent S phase entry in cells that
have undergone mitotic slippage or aborted cytokinesis
[17]. The checkpoint is believed to sense the increase
in chromosome number and halt the cell in a tetraploid
G1 state. However, the existence of this checkpoint
has been disputed [10,18,19]. It is likely that the p53dependent arrest after tetraploidization is mainly due to
DNA damage or centrosomal stress during the aberrant
mitosis [2]. Indeed, γ-H2AX can readily be detected in
cells undergoing prolonged mitotic arrest [20,21]; even
though it is questionable whether the γ-H2AX induced
during mitosis is necessary an indicator of DNA damage
[22]. Another possibility that has been proposed is that the
lack of transcription during mitotic arrest induces stress
and triggers the subsequent cell cycle arrest [23].
How tetraploidization promotes chromosome
instability remains incompletely understood. At least in
yeast, the increase in improper microtubule-kinetochore
attachments in tetraploids contributes to chromosome
instability [9]. The extra centrosomes after tetraploidization
are also critical determinants of chromosome instability
[24]. In fact, an increase centrosome number is a
common characteristic of several tumors [25]. Because
centrosomes are microtubule organization centers, cells
with supernumerary centrosomes form multipolar mitotic
spindles and display other errors during chromosomal
segregation. The uneven segregation of genetic materials
into daughter cells results in different fates, including
mitotic catastrophe, aneuploidy, and transformation.
Nevertheless, multipolar mitosis can be suppressed in the
cell either by functional silencing of extra centrosomes or
by centrosome clustering [26-28].
Although tetraploidization can promote chromosome
instability, there is evidence that suggests tetraploidy is a
relatively more stable state than other aneuploidy [2]. Our
group also found that cells generated from tetraploidization
of Hep3B cells are relatively stable [29]. However,
cancer cell lines such as Hep3B do not contain functional
p53 and are already aneuploid and transformed before
tetraploidization. In this study, we examined whether
the tetraploidy state is intrinsically unstable by using
untransformed mouse fibroblasts. We found that tetraploid
fibroblasts generated by cell fusion are chromosomally
stable over many generations, even when p53 is depleted.
In contrast, tetraploids induced in the absence of p53 are

chromosomally unstable and transformed.

RESULTS
Tetraploidization is accompanied with a rapid
loss of chromosomal stability
Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts expressing wild type p53 were
used to examine genome instability after tetraploidization.
Swiss 3T3 were used instead of primary fibroblasts because
p53 is frequently mutated when MEFs are immortalized
using the 3T3 protocol. To induce tetraploidization,
the cells were incubated with dihydrocytochalasin B
(DCB), a drug that interferes with actin assembly, to
inhibit cytokinesis. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed
that DCB-treated cells displayed mainly tetraploid DNA
contents relative to untreated cells (Figure 1A). Cells
containing up to 8N DNA contents could be detected at 24
h after DCB treatment.
After treatment with DCB for 24 h, the fibroblasts
were propagated in drug-free medium. Although
tetraploids could be detected at passage 1, they were
progressively depleted during subsequent passages (Figure
1B). Immunoblotting of the lysates revealed that p53 was
strongly activated after tetraploidization (Figure 1C, lanes
2 and 6). These results suggest that tetraploidization of
fibroblasts was associated with an activation of p53
followed by the disappearance of the tetraploids.
To determine if DCB-induced tetraploidization
could promote transformation, cells were plated in soft
agar to assay for anchorage-independent growth. Figure
1D shows that DCB-treated 3T3 cells were unable to
form colonies in soft agar. By contrast, depletion of p53
with three siRNAs (see later for the characterization of
the siRNAs) in DCB-treated 3T3 stimulated anchorageindependent growth. As a control, transfection of p53
siRNA in control 3T3 cells did not promote anchorageindependent growth. Immunoblotting verified that the
induction of p53 after DCB treatment was suppressed by
the siRNAs (Figure 1C). These data are in agreement with
the findings of Fujiwara et al. (2005) that primary cells
can be transformed by a combination of tetraploidization
and a loss of p53.
Collectively, these observations suggest that
tetraploidy induced in 3T3 fibroblasts by DCB treatment
was unstable, and that transformation could be promoted
by the downregulation of p53.

Generation of tetraploid 3T3 fibroblasts by cell
fusion
To examine the contribution of p53 to genome
stability after tetraploidization, p53-/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts were propagated using a 3T3 protocol (called

p53-/-3T3 herein). Given that most DCB-treated cells loss
tetraploidy during passage, more stable tetraploid cells
were generated with a strategy involving cell fusion and
antibiotic selection (Figure 2A). Plasmids expressing
blasticidin- or G418-resistant gene were first transfected
individually into 3T3 or p53-/-3T3. Stable cell lines
resistant to the respective antibiotics were generated after
selection. Cell-cell fusion was then performed between
serum-starved blasticidin- and G418-resistant cells.
Figure 2A verifies that immediately after fusion, some
cells contained two nuclei and four centrosomes. The
cells were then selected with both blasticidin and G418.
More than a dozen of individual colonies from both p53positive and -negative background were isolated. Data
from several representative clones are presented in this
paper.
Examination of the cell lines obtained by fusion
with indirect fluorescent microscopy revealed that the
majority of cells underwent biopolar mitosis (~98%). Four
centrosomes were frequently observed in interphase cells
and also occasionally in prometaphase cells (Figure 2B).
However, only rarely were we able to find cells with more

than two microtubule organization centers at later stages
of mitosis (~2% of mitotic cells). These data suggest
that despite the presence of multiple centrosomes during
interphase, the cells were able to undergo bipolar mitosis,
possibly due to mechanisms involving centrosome
clustering [25].
We next examined the DNA contents of the cells
obtained by cell fusion. The 3T3-fusion clones contained
approximate double the amount of DNA as the parental
cells (e.g. clone #2 and #27) (Figure 3A). In marked
contrast, most p53-/-3T3-fusion clones contained subtetraploidy amount of DNA (e.g. clone #5). Some clones
did contain more DNA than the parental cells, but they
were clearly less than tetraploidy (e.g. clone #10). In
agreement with the flow cytometry results, direct counting
of chromosomes after mitotic spread indicated that 3T3fusion cells were roughly tetraploids (Figure 3B).
These results indicate that while fusion of wild type
3T3 fibroblasts generated stable tetraploids, fusion of cells
without p53 favored the appearance of sub-tetraploids.
These results are consistent with the idea that cells with
chromosomal instability following tetraploidization could

shows that the duration of mitosis was marginally extended
in 3T3-fusion. Finally, the growth rates of 3T3 and 3T3fusion were also comparable (Figure 4C). In contrast, p53/3T3-fusion cells proliferated significantly faster than the
parental p53-/-3T3 (Figure 4C). These results indicate that
cells generated by fusion in the absence of p53 displayed
proliferation advantage over the diploid counterparts.

parental 3T3 fibroblasts, 3T3-fusion clones were unable to
form colonies in soft agar (Figure 5A). In contrast, p53-/3T3-fusion clones could readily proliferate. In agreement
with the soft agar assays, cells from p53-/-3T3-fusion, but
not 3T3-fusion, were able to form tumors after injection
into nude mice (data not shown). These data indicate
that while cell fusion in the absence of p53 promoted
transformation, stable tetraploids generated by fusion of
p53-positive fibroblasts remained non-transformed.

tetraploidization could also induce similar effects. To
this end, we first validated that both 3T3 and 3T3-fusion
indeed contained functional p53. Figure 6A shows that
p53 and its downstream target p21CIP1/WAF1 were induced
after treatment with the genotoxic agents Adriamycin and
nocodazole. The p53 pathway was also induced to a lesser
extent by hydroxyurea and ionizing radiation. These data
confirm that 3T3-fusion still retained functional p53.
To downregulate p53, three siRNAs were transfected
either individually or in a mixture. Figure 6B shows that

genotoxic stress-induced p53 responses are functional in
both 3T3 and 3T3-fusion, and that they can be effectively
disrupted by siRNAs.
We then analyzed if downregulation of p53 in 3T3fusion cells could destabilize the tetraploidy state and lead
to transformation. Three rounds of siRNA transfection
were performed to ensure that p53 was depleted over
several generations. Figure 7A shows that the p53 siRNA
treatment did not lead to a collapse of the tetraploidy
state. Furthermore, the cells did not acquire transformed
phenotype in soft agar (Figure 7B) or nude mice
tumorigenicity assays (data not shown). The same results
were obtained with cells from early or late passages of two
independent 3T3-fusion clones. As a positive control, cells
generated from fusion of p53-/-3T3 displayed anchorageindependent growth (Figure 7B). Collectively, these
results suggest that once tetraploid fibroblasts are stably
established, chromosomal stability is no longer sensitive
to p53 downregulation.

B1 did not affect the activation of p53-p21CIP1/WAF1 by
Adriamycin (lane 12). Likewise, activation of the p53p21CIP1/WAF1 pathway by Adriamycin in 3T3-fusion could
be suppressed by the p53 siRNAs (Figure 6C).
To confirm that the DNA damage responses in
3T3 and tetraploid fibroblasts were impaired after p53
depletion, the cells were analyzed with flow cytometry
(Figure 6D). While the G1 DNA damage checkpoint is
mediated by the p53-p21CIP1/WAF1 axis, the intra-S and
G2 DNA damage checkpoints mainly rely on the ATM/
ATR-CHK1/CHK2 axis that is independent on p53 [30].
Flow cytometry analysis revealed the presence of cells
in G1, late S phase, and G2 phase following Adriamycin
treatment (Figure 6D), indicating the functioning of the
checkpoints in both 3T3 and 3T3-fusion fibroblasts. After
depletion of p53 with siRNAs, the Adriamycin-mediated
G1 delay was abolished in both cell lines. In contrast,
the p53-independent intra-S or G2 checkpoints were
not affected. Taken together, these data indicate that the

immediately after DCB treatment (Figure 1C). The
increase in the duration of mitosis after tetraploidization
may also be responsible for inducing p53 [33]. The
activation of p53 pathways then eliminated the cells
by either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis [13]. Only the
rare cells that were able to undergo bipolar mitosis are
chromosomally stable as tetraploids and did not activate
p53 (Figure 8). Flow cytometry analysis (Figure 3A)
and direct chromosome counting (Figure 3B) indicated
that the 3T3-fusion cell lines were roughly tetraploidy in
relation to the parental 3T3 cells.
How the small number of tetraploid cells could avoid
multipolar mitosis is unclear. Many cancer cells also appear
to have mechanisms that suppress multipolar mitosis,
including functional silencing of extra centrosomes or
centrosome clustering [26-28]. In a whole genome-wide
RNAi screen with the near-tetraploid Drosophila S2
cells, Kwon et al. (2008) identified a variety of genes that
are required for centrosome clustering, including those
function in organizing the spindle microtubules and the
spindle-assembly checkpoint [28]. It was also found that
the interphase cell shape and adhesion pattern influence
the success of the subsequent mitosis in cells with extra
centrosomes.
From our model, tetraploids should be
chromosomally stable once they are established. In
agreement with this, both the chromosome number and
the nontransformed phenotype of tetraploid 3T3-fusion
were remarkably stable in culture. No discernable change
in the ploidy was detected up to passage 34 after clonal
isolation (Figure 5B). Moreover, the tetraploid 3T3-fusion
cells retained a doubling time similar to the parental cells
(Figures 4C and 5C) and were not transformed even after

DISCUSSION
Unlike organisms such as fish and amphibian,
tetraploidization is poorly tolerated in mammals. In fact,
only a handful of tetraploid human infants have been
documented [31]. On the cellular level, tetraploids are
unstable because the extra centrosomes lead to multipolar
mitosis, segregating the chromosomes unequally among
the daughters. Accordingly, tetraploid fibroblasts
generated by transient blocking of cytokinesis with DCB
were chromosomally unstable (Figure 1B). In fact, over
80% of mitoses after DCB treatments were multipolar
(data not shown). Tetraploids generated by other methods,
such as CDK1 inhibitor-promoted mitotic slippage, were
similarly unstable (our unpublished data).
Whether tetraploidy per se leads to chromosome
instability has yet to be established. In this study, we
studied tetraploidization by cell fusion of spontaneously
immortalized mouse fibroblasts. Although many 3T3
lines are known to contain mutated p53, the Swiss 3T3
cells used here retain functional p53 [32]. This was also
confirmed by the activation of both p53 and p21CIP1/WAF1
after genotoxic stress (Figure 6A).
Based on the results obtained here, we propose a
model for p53 in tetraploidization and transformation
(Figure 8). Due to the increase in centrosomes after cell
fusion, a large population of cells may undergo mutipolar
mitosis. The unequal segregation of chromosomes
disrupts gene dosage and homeostatsis, possibly leading
to the activation of p53-dependent pathways. In agreement
with this, p53 was strongly induced during the passages

Figure 8: The involvement of p53 in chromosomal instability after tetraploidization. Most cells undergo mutipolar mitosis after

cell fusion. The unequal segregation of chromosomes leads to the activation of p53-dependent pathway, eliminating the cells by either cell
cycle arrest or apoptosis. Cells that are able to undergo bipolar mitosis are chromosomally stable as tetraploids (upper part of the schematic
diagram). Subsequent downregulation of p53 in these tetraploids would not affect genome stability. On the other hand, cells that lack p53
during tetraploidization may survive after undergoing multipolar mitosis (lower part of the schematic diagram). Fast growing sub-tetraploids
may then be generated.

was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, triturated by drawing
the suspension through a pipette, and then divided into
two 100-mm tissue culture dishes. Cells were grown in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A 3T3 subculture
schedule was employed by plating 1x106 cells onto
each of three 100-mm dishes. Every three days the cells
were trypsinized, pooled, and counted to determine the
population doublings. The cells were then plated onto three
new dishes as before. Unless stated otherwise, cells were
treated with the following reagents at the indicated final
concentration: Adriamycin (0.2 µg/ml), blasticidin (5 µg/
ml), dihydrocytochalasin B (10 µM), G418 (500 µg/ml),
hydroxyurea (1.5 mM), nocodazole (0.1 µg/ml). Ionizing
radiation was delivered with a caesium137 source from an

extensive culturing (Figure 5A).
Another characteristic of the model is that the
subsequent downregulation of p53 in these tetraploids
should not affect genome stability. Accordingly, depletion
of p53 after tetraploids had been established did not result
in transformation (Figure 7). In contrast, eliminating the
p53 responses before tetraploidization by either using
siRNAs or a p53-/- background promoted chromosomal
instability and transformation.
According to our model (Figure 8), cells that lack
p53 during tetraploidization may survive after undergoing
multipolar mitosis. Fast growing sub-tetraploids would
then be generated and took over the population. Consistent
with this idea, transformed p53-/-3T3-fusion fibroblasts
exhibited a faster doubling time than the parental cells
(Figure 4C). There is already compelling evidence that p53
is involved in guarding against transformation following
tetraploidization. Fujiwara et al. (2005) indicates that
tetraploid p53-null mouse mammary epithelial cells
generated by transient blocking of cytokinesis are prone
to aneuploidy and tumorigenesis [10]. We also found
that induction of tetraploidization of 3T3 fibroblasts
with DCB in the presence of p53 siRNA could stimulate
transformation (Figure 1D). Likewise, fusion of p53/-3T3 cells promoted anchorage-independent growth
(Figure 5A).
In conclusion, we found that tetraploidy in fibroblasts
per se is not intrinsically unstable. Cells at early stages
of tetraploidization are chromosomally unstable and are
probably removed by p53-dependent mechanisms. They
are thus prone to transformation in the absence of p53. In
contrast, established tetraploids are chromosomally stable
and resistant to transformation by depletion of p53.

Cell fusion and stable cell lines
Cells were serum-starved (cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 0.1% serum) for 24 h, trypsinized,
collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 5 ml of
50 µM SDS in PBS. After incubation at room temperature
for 5 min, the cells were collected by centrifugation
and resuspended slowly (over one minute) in 1 ml of
polyethylenglycol (PEG) 4000 and incubated for another
minute. The cells were then mixed with 9 ml of serum-free
medium, collected by centrifugation, washed with serumfree medium, before resuspension in complete medium.
Selection medium was added at the second passage after
fusion. For G418- and blasticidin-resistant cell lines, cells
were transfected with plasmids expressing the respective
antibiotic resistant genes. Single colonies were isolated
after about two weeks of selection. Antibiotics were
not included in the medium once the cell lines were
established.
