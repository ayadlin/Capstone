Abstract
Edmonston vaccine strains of measles virus (MV) have signiﬁcant
antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of ovarian cancer.
MV engineered to express the sodium iodide symporter gene (MVNIS) facilitates localization of viral gene expression and offers a tool
for tumor radiovirotherapy. Here, we report results from a clinical
evaluation of MV-NIS in patients with taxol- and platinum-resistant
ovarian cancer. MV-NIS was given intraperitoneally every 4 weeks
for up to 6 cycles. Treatment was well tolerated and associated with
promising median overall survival in these patients with heavily
pretreated ovarian cancer; no dose-limiting toxicity was observed in
16 patients treated at high-dose levels (108–109 TCID50), and their
median overall survival of 26.5 months compared favorably with

other contemporary series. MV receptor CD46 and nectin-4 expression was conﬁrmed by immunohistochemistry in patient tumors.
Sodium iodide symporter expression in patient tumors after treatment was conﬁrmed in three patients by 123I uptake on SPECT/CTs
and was associated with long progression-free survival. Immune
monitoring posttreatment showed an increase in effector T cells
recognizing the tumor antigens IGFBP2 and FRa, indicating that
MV-NIS treatment triggered cellular immunity against the patients'
tumor and suggesting that an immune mechanism mediating the
observed antitumor effect. Our ﬁndings support further clinical
evaluation of MV-NIS as an effective immunovirotherapy. Cancer

Introduction

resistant ovarian cancer report median overall survival (OS) in
the order of 12 months or less (2–8). There is a pressing need for
more effective treatments to improve the outcome of these
patients.
Virotherapy is a treatment approach with mechanisms of action
that are not cross resistant with chemotherapy. Moreover, virotherapy approaches with conditionally replicating viruses have
the potential to overcome an important limitation of gene transfer
approaches using nonreplicating vectors, i.e., their limited infection/transduction efﬁciency (9). Because recurrent ovarian cancer
remains conﬁned in the peritoneal cavity in more than 80% of the
patients, it provides a therapeutic opportunity for locoregional
administration of novel therapeutics, including virotherapy
agents. Despite promising preclinical work with different virotherapy agents (10), however, only a handful of clinical virotherapy trials have been reported. Early work with the conditionally replicating E1B attenuated adenovirus Onyx-015 in ovarian cancer showed no evidence of antitumor efﬁcacy (11); this
possibly reﬂected low expression levels of the native adenoviral
receptor CAR (coxsackie-adenovirus-receptor) in ovarian tumors
(12), a problem that a recently completed phase I trial with
replicating adenovirus AD5.SSTR/TK.RGD (allowing CAR-independent infection; refs. 13, 14) attempted to overcome.
Measles virus (MV) is a negative-strand enveloped RNA virus
(4), with six genes encoding 8 proteins (4). The H-protein is the
surface glycoprotein that mediates MV attachment to its three
known receptors, the CD46 molecule (15), the signaling lymphocyte activating molecule (SLAM) receptor (predominantly

Ovarian cancer is the second most common malignancy of the
female genital tract in the United States, causing an estimated
14,000 deaths in 2013 (1). Despite aggressive initial therapy,
including debulking surgery followed by taxane/platinum-based
regimens, the majority of the patients relapse. Although ovarian
cancer is often initially sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, patients ultimately develop resistance. For resistant disease,
patients are generally treated with agents such as liposomal
doxorubicin (2, 3), topotecan (4), weekly paclitaxel (5, 6) or
gemcitabine (2). Bevacizumab has also demonstrated some activity (7, 8), but most clinical trials in patients with platinum1

Measles Virus Strain Expressing NIS for Ovarian Cancer Treatment

present on activated B, T cells, and monocytes; ref. 16), and the
recently identiﬁed epithelial receptor nectin-4 (17). The F-protein
is responsible for cell fusion following viral attachment. Cells
infected by MV express F and H proteins on their membranes and,
therefore, become highly fusogenic, causing fusion with uninfected neighboring cells, with the characteristic cytopathic effect of
syncytia formation. Of note, natural infection with MV has been
associated with spontaneous tumor regression in patients with
Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (18, 19).
Although the wild-type MV can lead to a potentially serious
infectious disease, attenuated strains (vaccine strains) of MV have
an outstanding safety record (20).
Of importance and in contrast to variable expression of receptors for other viral vectors, two of the three receptors for the MV are
consistently expressed at high levels on ovarian tumors. This
includes the CD46 receptor or complement cofactor protein
(21), the expression of which allows tumor cells to evade complement-mediated lysis (22), and nectin-4 (23).
The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is a membrane ion channel
expressed on thyroid follicular cells that allows iodide trapping.
NIS expression in thyroid tissue has been exploited for more than
50 years in clinical practice for thyroid imaging (with 123I or
Technetium 99m), or ablation (with 131I), and for systemic
therapy of well-differentiated thyroid malignancies (24). MV-NIS,
a recombinant MV strain of the Edmonston vaccine lineage
expressing the NIS gene, has the same vector backbone as the
MV-CEA virus we tested in a recently completed phase I trial in
patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (25) except for the transgenes (Supplementary Fig. S1). For MV-CEA, the extracellular
domain of the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene was
inserted at position 1 upstream of the measles nucleocapsid (N)
gene. For MV-NIS, the NIS cDNA was inserted downstream of the
measles hemagglutinin (H) gene. Of note, transgene location
for MV-NIS results in viral proliferation advantage as compared
with MV-CEA, due to a transcriptional gradient in MV genome
transcription (4). The latter also facilitates viral manufacturing in
higher titers.
In in vitro experiments, MV-NIS induced the characteristic
cytopathic effect of syncytia formation in ovarian cancer cells,
but not in nontransformed cells such as normal human dermal
ﬁbroblasts or mesothelial cells, and led to concentration of radioiodine isotopes (125I) in infected ovarian cancer cells (26). In
addition, MV-NIS had signiﬁcant antitumor activity, both in
subcutaneous and orthotopic SKOV3ip.1 models leading to
growth arrest and signiﬁcant prolongation of survival in orthotopic models (26). Imaging, following Tc-99M or 123I administration, demonstrated strong uptake in peritoneal tumors, suggesting that the NIS transgene could be used to localize viral gene
expression.
Given the favorable performance features with MV-NIS, we
launched a phase I/II trial in women with treatment-resistant
ovarian cancer. The goals were to (i) determine the safety and
tolerability of intraperitoneal administration of MV-NIS in
patients with treatment-resistant ovarian cancer; (ii) assess, in a
preliminary fashion, the antitumor efﬁcacy of this approach by
following CA-125 levels, radiographic response, time to progression, and survival; (iii) characterize expression of the MV receptors
CD46 and nectin-4 in the patient tumor tissue; (iv) characterize
viral gene expression using NIS expression as the surrogate; (v)
assess viremia, viral replication and MV shedding, and persistence;
and (f) determine humoral immune response to the injected virus.

Patients and Methods
Patient selection
Eligible patients had persistent, recurrent, or progressive epithelial ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer after prior
treatment with platinum compounds and taxanes. Histologic
conﬁrmation of the original or recurrent tumor was required.
Patients had to be 18 years old with adequate hematologic, liver,
and kidney function, as deﬁned by absolute neutrophil count
(ANC)  1,500/mL; platelets  100,000/mL; hemoglobin  9
gm/dL; total bilirubin  upper limit of normal; and creatinine
1.5  upper limit of normal. Patients had to be immune to MV
as shown by antimeasles IgG levels  20 ELISA units/mL, determined by enzyme immunoassay (Diamedix). Exclusion criteria
included platinum-sensitive disease; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 3 or 4; chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy 4 weeks before study entry.
Patients were also excluded if they had an HIV-positive test or
history of other immunodeﬁciency, organ transplantation, history of chronic hepatitis B or C, intraabdominal disease >8 cm at
the time of registration, intrahepatic disease, or disease beyond
the peritoneal cavity. This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic
Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written
informed consent.
Treatment
Construction of the MV-NIS virus has been previously
described (27): a schematic representation of the MV-NIS genome
is included in Supplementary Fig. S1. Clinical lots of the virus were
produced by the Mayo Clinic Gene and Virus Therapy Shared
Resource (GVTSR). During the course of the study, a new FDAapproved vector production methodology was developed by
GVTSR employing HeLa as the producer cell line, which allowed
production of clinical grade vector in higher titers as compared
with the original Vero cell–based methodology (28). All patients
underwent laparotomy or laparoscopy, for placement of the
intraperitoneal catheter (Bard Access Systems). Peritoneal adhesions were lysed if technically possible. If ascites was present, it
was drained through the peritoneal catheter before the viral
administration. Patients received infusion of the MV-NIS diluted
in 500 mL of normal saline over 30 minutes. Treatment was
repeated monthly for up to 6 cycles, provided that toxicity was
acceptable and there was no evidence of disease progression.
Experimental design and statistical analysis
The standard cohorts-of-three design (29) was applied. There
were two dose levels (108 and 109 TCID50). Dose levels were
determined based on the MV-CEA trial results and impacted by
manufacturing limitations at the time of trial initiation. Three
patients were treated per dose level and observed for 4 weeks
before accrual to the next higher dose level was initiated. Intrapatient dose escalation was not allowed. Toxicity was assessed using
Common Terminology Criteria Version 3.0. Dose-limiting toxicity
was deﬁned as grade 3 hematologic toxicity except for grade 3
ANC lasting <72 hours, elevation of serum creatine 2 the
baseline, any other nonhematologic toxicity grade 3, viremia
lasting for 6 weeks from last viral administration, grade 2
symptomatic bronchospasm or urticaria, and any grade 3 or higher
allergic reactions. Following completion of the dose escalation
phase of the trial, 10 patients were treated at the MTD to better
characterize treatment safety and efﬁcacy. Time to progression was

deﬁned as date of study enrollment to date of progressive disease;
overall survival (OS) was deﬁned as date of study enrollment to
date of death or last follow-up in living patients. Time to progression and OS were summarized using a Kaplan–Meier approach.
Laboratory evaluation
Before treatment, patients had a history and physical exam
performed, as well as a complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time
(aPTT), chemistry group, urinalysis, chest X-ray, HIV testing,
CA-125 measurements, and electrocardiogram. CBC, chemistry
group, PT, and aPTT were repeated on day 8, day 15, and before
retreatment (cycles 2–6). In addition, peritoneal aspirates (or
peritoneal lavage samples if no ascites) were obtained at
baseline, day 3, day 8, and before all subsequent cycles. The
peritoneal aspirate was tested for the presence of the virus by
Vero cell overlay and quantitative reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR), and anti-MV IgG antibodies. Patients' blood, urine,
and mouth gargle specimens were tested for the presence of the
virus (viremia and shedding) at multiple time points (Supplementary Fig. S2). Patient's immune competence [CD4, CD8
counts, immunoglobulins, complement, delayed-typed hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction to Candida, puriﬁed protein derivative, tetanus, and trichophyton] and humoral immunity
against the virus were also tested at multiple time points
(Supplementary Fig. S2). NIS expression in infected tumor was
assessed by 123I SPECT/CT imaging, as outlined in Supplementary Fig. S3.
Assessment of antitumor response
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (30) were
applied for response assessment. CT or MRI and CA-125 measurements were done at baseline and before retreatment on cycles
2 to 6.
Detection and quantitation of MV N-gene RNA by QRT-PCR in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mouth gargle, and urine
specimens
Total RNA was extracted using either Trizol reagent (Invitrogen;
Cat # 15596-026) and ethanol precipitation (urine and mouth
gargle specimens) or the PaxGene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen; Cat #
762164). Blood for isolation of PBMC's was collected using the
PAXgene Blood RNA tubes as recommended by the manufacturer.
Brieﬂy, the QRT-PCR assay has been optimized for primers and
probe, with Invitrogen-ABI TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix
Reagent and run on the Roche480 machine. The 50-mL qRT-PCR
reaction volume was used to amplify a 61 base pair MV N genomic
RNA target, in the presence of 0.3 mmol/L each forward primer
(50 -GGGTTGGCCGGTTGGA30 ), reverse primer (50 -AGAAGCCAGGGAGAGCTACAGA30 ) and a 0.2 mmol/L Blackhole Quencher
labeled probe (50 -/56-FAM/TGGGCAGCTCTCGCATCACTTGC3BHQ_1/-30 ), 4 mmol/L MgCl, and 1 mg or a maximum volume
of 5 mL of total RNA isolate. One cycle of RT reaction (30 minutes
at 48 C) is applied followed by an activation step (10 minutes at
95 C), and 45 cycles of ampliﬁcation (15 seconds at 95 C and 1
minute at 60 C), with ﬂuorescence measured during the extension. A standard curve of 10-fold dilutions of an RNA fragment
obtained in vitro transcription, containing 10 to 107 MV-N gene
copies/mL, was used in the assay. Calculation of copy number was
determined using the standard curve and the Roche480 machine
Absolute quantiﬁcation software.

Assessment of CD46 and nectin-4 expression in ovarian tumors
Immunohistochemistry for CD46.
The primary antibody CD46 (EPR4014; AbCam; Cat#
ab108307) was diluted 1:500, and slides were incubated overnight, at 4 C in a humidiﬁed chamber, then incubated with a
Donkey Anti rabbit IgG-B biotinylated secondary antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotech. Inc.; Cat # sc-2040) for 60 minutes at room
temperature, followed by a detection step with Vectastain ABC
and Peroxidase substrate DAB kits (Vector Labs. Inc.; PK-6100 and
Cat # SK-4100), counterstained using Accustain solution (Sigma;
Cat # GSH-116), then dehydrated and mounted using VectaMount H-5000 permanent mounting solution (Vector labs; Cat#
H-5000).
Immunochemistry for nectin-4.
The primary antibody Nectin4 MAB2659 (R&D Systems; Cat#
AF2659) was diluted 1:500, and the slides were incubated overnight, at 4 C in a humidiﬁed chamber. For the next step, a
secondary antibody reagent part of a Tissue Staining Goat
HRP-DAB system kit was used (Abcam; Cat# CTS008) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. After the detection step, the
slides were counterstained using Accustain solution, dehydrated,
and mounted using VectaMount H-5000 solution.
Assessment of humoral immune response against MV
Anti-MV IgG antibody levels were measured using the Diamedix Immunoassay, as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Assessment of cellular immune response against ovarian cancer
antigens
IFNgamma and IL4 ELIspots were performed as previously
described except that a 48-hour rather 10-day format was used
(31). To detect tumor-speciﬁc T-cell immunity, a degenerate panel
of peptides derived from either the folate receptor alpha (FRa;
FR30, FR56, FR113, and FR238) or insulin-like growth factor
binding protein 2 (IGFBP2; IGFBP2.17, IGFBP2.22, IGFBP2.249,
and IGFBP2.293), as previously described, was used (32, 33). The
plates were read on an AID ELISpot reader (Cell Technology, Inc.;
reader software v.3.1.1.). A positive response was deﬁned as a
frequency that was both detectable (i.e., >1:100,000) and significantly (P < 0.05, two-tailed t test) greater than the mean of control
no-antigen wells. Results are presented as the sum of the antigenspeciﬁc effector T cells for each peptide and each antigen.

Results
Patient characteristics
Sixteen patients with recurrent ovarian cancer were treated in
this phase I trial. Table 1 summarizes the patients' characteristics.
All participating patients had platinum-resistant disease and had
been heavily pretreated having received a median of 4 chemotherapy regimens for recurrent disease.
Toxicity
Given the excellent safety of the closely related MV-CEA virus in
our other recently completed phase I trial (25), only the highest
viral doses tested in the MV-CEA trial were explored in the MV-NIS
study (108 and 109 TCID50). Three patients received treatment at
the 108 TCID50 dose level and three at the 109 TCID50 dose level.
An additional 10 patients were then treated at the 109 TCID50
MTD expansion dose to better characterize the safety of the

antitumor efﬁcacy. No signiﬁcant or dose-limiting toxicity was
observed. Figure 1 summarizes cycle 1 toxicity for all study

direct bilirubin and, grade 3 neutropenia. Blood and urine cultures and QRT-PCR of blood, urine, and mouth gargle specimens
ruled out an infectious etiology, including MV infection. Of note,
this patient was treated with a viral lot prepared with the original
(Vero cell based) production methodology. No allergic reactions
were observed in any of the subsequent 13 patients who received
virus prepared with the newer HeLa cell–based methodology
(28). Immunosuppression has been observed following wildtype MV infection and can be associated with DTH suppression,
bacterial infections, and reactivation of tuberculosis (34). Immunosuppression is, however, very infrequent following measles
vaccination (35). Similar to the MV-CEA trial, in this study no
evidence of treatment-induced immunosuppression was
observed. Speciﬁcally, there were no treatment-related infections
and no signiﬁcant change in CD4, CD8, immunoglobulin, or
complement levels (data not shown). In addition, no patient
developed suppression of an initially positive DTH reaction.
Efﬁcacy
Best objective response was stable disease in 13 of 16 patients
(81%); this included 2 of 3 patients treated at dose level 1 and 11
of 13 patients at dose level 2. Responses of the tumor marker CA125 were observed in 2 patients, both treated with 109 TCID50.
Median duration of stable disease was 67 days, (range, 54–277
days). Median OS for study patients was 26.6 months, 95%
conﬁdence interval: 16.3–37.3 months. This correlates with the
observed median OS of 38.4 months in patients who received the
higher doses of 108 and 109 TCID50 in the MV-CEA trial (25) and
compares favorably with the observed OS in contemporary trials
targeting the same platinum-resistant patient population, including trials employing bevacizumab-based regimens, which ranges
from 6 to 12 months (3, 5–8). Of note, survival outcomes in the
completed MV-CEA trial (25) were dose dependent with patients
receiving 108 TCID50 or higher doses of the virus surviving
signiﬁcantly longer (median OS, 38.4 months) as compared with
patients who received lower doses (median OS, 10.6 months).
Table 2 summarizes outcomes in both trials according to viral
dose received.
Despite our initial hypothesis that a heavier tumor burden
would facilitate oncolysis and antitumor effect, we have observed
very intriguing evidence of clinical efﬁcacy in patients with low
disease burden as highlighted in the following study patient
example. The patient was diagnosed with grade 3 serous papillary
carcinoma, underwent hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy,
and tumor debulking followed by standard adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of intravenous paclitaxel and carboplatin. After
four chemotherapy treatment cycles, the patient was found to
have progressive disease in the pelvic area and was referred to our
institution. At that time she had optimal secondary debulking
performed with microscopic residual disease remaining at the end
of the procedure. Following intraperitoneal port placement,
patient proceeded to receive six cycles of intraperitoneal MV-NIS.
As per the trial eligibility criteria, the patient was measles immune
at study entry, with a high measles IgG titer of 94.8 EU/mL
(positive  20 EU/mL). The patient's tumor marker CA-125
decreased from 70 U/mL pretreatment to 20 U/mL posttreatment.
SPECT/CT imaging showed NIS expression with 123I uptake in
sites of pelvic implants, indicating viral gene expression in areas of
residual disease. Following six treatment cycles with MV-NIS, a
second look laparoscopy was performed as prespeciﬁed per
protocol and multiple biopsies were obtained. There was no

viable tumor remaining; only ﬁbrosis and residual sclerotic reaction was observed. Figure 2 depicts the pathologic ﬁndings at
baseline (2A) as well as the complete absence of viable tumor
(pathologic CR) at the time of the second look laparotomy (2B).
The patient remained disease free for 25 months, at which time
she presented with extra abdominal relapse consisting of metastatic disease in a pericardial lymph node.

Assessment of immune response to MV
Figure 3 depicts mean serum antimeasles antibody levels in the
serum at baseline and on study completion according to dose
levels. As per study eligibility, all patients were measles immune at
baseline. There was no signiﬁcant change in the measles antibody
titers in blood and peritoneal ﬂuid (data not shown) during the
course of the trial, as compared with baseline.

Expression of the MV-NIS receptor CD46 and nectin-4 in tumor
specimens
Immunohistochemical analysis of baseline tumor samples from
study patients showed moderate or high expression of CD46 and
nectin-4 MV receptors in all patients (Fig. 2C and D, respectively).
Speciﬁcally, 3 of 14 (21%) patients had moderate CD46 expression
and 10 of 14 (71%) patients had high CD46 expression, whereas 1
of 14 patients (7%) had moderate nectin-4 expression and 13 of 14
(93%) had high nectin-4 expression. Of note, the 1 patient who was
negative for CD46 had high nectin-4 expression.

Detection of the NIS transgene
123
I SPECT/CT imaging was performed at baseline of cycles 1
and 2 and on days 3, 8, and 15 of cycle 1. In case of a positive scan,
additional imaging was obtained on day 25. Imaging during cycle
2 was performed only if positive results were obtained in cycle 1 at
corresponding time points. NIS expression as imaged by 123I
uptake was observed in 3 of the 13 patients treated at the 109
TCID50 dose level. Figure 4 shows representative imaging in one of
the study patients. The patient's 123I scans were positive on days 8
and 15 of cycle 1 and days 8, 15, and 21 of cycle 2, indicating viral

MV. Imaging was negative at baseline both at cycle 1 and before
retreatment at cycle 2. A second patient had 123I positivity,
indicating NIS expression, on day 8 of cycle 1, and the third
patient on day 15 of cycle 1.

Assessment of viral biodistribution and shedding
There was no evidence of shedding as tested by quantitative RTPCR in mouth gargle and urine specimens for any of the study
patients at the prespeciﬁed time points (Supplementary Fig. S2),
and no detection of viral genomes in peripheral blood.

Treatment with MV-NIS augments endogenous immunity
against tumor antigens
Although our initial phase I studies were not designed to collect
and preserve T cells for functional analysis, the observed clinical
beneﬁt in some of the study patients in the context of minimal
residual disease raised the possibility that in addition to oncolysis,
other mechanisms such as the development of an antitumor
immune response might be contributing to the favorable clinical
outcomes. We therefore collected pre- and posttreatment specimens in a subgroup of study patients to investigate the possible
immunotherapeutic potential of this approach and address the
vaccine effects of MV and the role of antitumor immunity in the
clinical efﬁcacy of MV treatment. Figure 5 shows the results of an
IFNg ELIspot analysis of the specimens obtained from 4 MV-NIS–
treated patients, demonstrating that MV treatment activates tumor
antigen–speciﬁc T cells. In that experiment, peripheral blood T
cells were stimulated with a pool of HLA-DR epitopes derived
from the FRa or IGFBP2. Both of these antigens are highly
expressed in a high percentage of patients with ovarian cancer
and some patients with ovarian cancer demonstrate natural
immunity to these antigens (32, 33). As shown, patients treated
with MV-NIS augmented immune responses to both antigens but
not to tetanus, which was added as a control for speciﬁcity of the
immune response. Similar results were obtained when an IL4
ELISPOT analysis for the same antigens was performed. In addition, pre- and posttreatment sera samples, available from 31
patients that received either MV-CEA or MV-NIS, were tested to
detect antibodies targeting FRa, HER-2, CEA, and IGFBP2; no
responses to any of the antigens were generated. Collectively, the
generation of IFNg T-cell response and no antibody response

Discussion
This trial conﬁrmed the safety of an engineered MV strain
expressing the NIS transgene, given intraperitoneally, for the
treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer and demonstrated early
evidence of antitumor activity. No dose-limiting toxicity was
observed in doses as high as 109 TCID50. The most common
toxicities were mild (grade 1–2, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever,
and neutropenia). This is consistent with the excellent safety
record of the oncolytic MV platform in other malignancies (independent of the route of administration), including intratumoral
and resection cavity (recurrent head and neck, recurrent glioblastoma; ref. 36), intravenously with or without cyclophosphamide
(multiple myeloma; refs. 37, 38), and intrapleurally (mesothelioma; ref. 39).
The observed median OS of 26.5 months in this group of
heavily pretreated patients (median of four chemotherapy regimens for recurrent disease) is compelling. Of note, this survival
outcome is very similar to the OS in the MV-CEA trial at comparable dose levels (38.4 months at doses 108 TCID50 or higher vs.
only 10.6 months for patients who received lower MV-CEA
doses). The survival of patients treated with MV compares favorably with contemporary series of novel therapeutics in patients
with platinum-resistant or refractory ovarian cancer where the
observed OS ranges between 6 to 12 months (7, 40–43). It is of
note that this promising outcome was observed in the context of
preexisting antiviral immunity (Fig. 3).
It is also interesting that the long median OS in study patients
was associated with a relatively short median time to progression.
Although the latter could reﬂect the very aggressive imaging
schedule followed in this trial with CTs obtained every month,
the survival beneﬁt could also be indicative of a different mechanism of action, beyond oncolysis, contributing to the antitumor
effect, such as an immune-based mechanism. Although the correlative analysis in this trial was designed to examine the oncolytic
mechanism of action, several ﬁndings suggest immune-mediated
antitumor activity. Speciﬁcally, there were CA-125 responses in
MV-CEA–treated patients even at doses as low as 103 TCID50 (25);
moreover, the clinical beneﬁt that patients derived (including
pathologic complete response) in the context of microscopic
residual disease (see Results section) raises the possibility of an

immune-mediated antitumor effect. Although immunologic
analysis could be performed for only a small subgroup of study
patients, the immune response data support this hypothesis. The
results shown in Fig. 5 indicate the development of a Th1 response
against ovarian cancer antigens such as FRa and IGBP2.
The collective analysis of the MV-CEA and MV-NIS trial data
indicates a dose effect in the observed antitumor activity and
impact on survival, which suggests that improvement of oncolysis
could further optimize results with MV-based therapy. This
hypothesis is further strengthened by recent data deriving from
an MV trial in myeloma, where responses of disseminated disease
were accomplished following intravenous administration of high
MV-NIS doses to patients lacking neutralizing antibodies against
MV (38). Given the fact that the majority of patients with ovarian
cancer have neutralizing antibodies against the virus (38), we are
studying means to avoid immune capture of the virus and thus
facilitate its delivery to the tumor, such as using mesenchymal
stem cells for viral delivery (44).
On the basis of the results of the phase I/II study of MV-NIS
reported here, we have designed a randomized phase II trial
comparing intraperitoneal administration of MV-NIS to treating
physician's chemotherapy of choice for patients with recurrent
ovarian cancer and low disease burden, where the virus has a
higher likelihood of also working as effective immunotherapy.
Outcomes to be evaluated in the study, in addition to efﬁcacy and
toxicity assessment, include patient reported outcomes such as
quality of life given the favorable toxicity proﬁle of the virus as
compared to the known signiﬁcant side effects of standard chemotherapy approaches employed in ovarian cancer treatment.
This trial will also include a prospective immunologic analysis,
and thus it is expected to provide additional information on a
possible immune-mediated mechanism of action of MV-NIS and
guide future steps including combinatorial strategies with other
immunomodulatory approaches such as immune checkpoint
blockade (45, 46).
In summary, intraperitoneal administration of MV-NIS in
patients with recurrent ovarian cancer was associated with compelling survival outcomes and merits further prospective testing.
Moreover, this study has generated mechanistic hypotheses

regarding a novel immune-based mechanism of MV action that
we are planning to explore in additional trials.
