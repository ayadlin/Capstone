Abstract
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a polyphenol natural product
of the plant Curcuma longa, is undergoing early clinical trials
as a novel anticancer agent. However, the anticancer
mechanism of curcumin remains to be elucidated. Recently,
we have shown that curcumin inhibits phosphorylation of p70
S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)
binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), two downstream effector molecules of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) in numerous cancer cell lines. This study was
designed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. We observed
that curcumin inhibited mTORC1 signaling not by inhibition
of the upstream kinases, such as insulin-like growth factor 1
receptor (IGF-IR) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1
(PDK1). Further, we found that curcumin inhibited mTORC1
signaling independently of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or
AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK-tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This is evidenced by the findings that curcumin
was able to inhibit phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in the
cells pretreated with PP2A inhibitor (okadaic acid) or AMPK
inhibitor (compound C), or in the cells expressing dominantnegative (dn) PP2A, shRNA to PP2A-A subunit, or dn-AMPKA.
Curcumin did not alter the TSC1/2 interaction. Knockout of
TSC2 did not affect curcumin inhibition of mTOR signaling.
Finally, we identified that curcumin was able to dissociate
raptor from mTOR, leading to inhibition of mTORC1 activity.
Therefore, our data indicate that curcumin may represent a
new class of mTOR inhibitor. [Cancer Res 2009;69(3):1000–8]

Introduction
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a 289 kDa serine/
threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase, lies downstream of insulin-like
growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and phosphatidylinositol 3¶ kinase
(PI3K) and acts as a master regulator of a large array of cellular
processes, including cell proliferation, growth, differentiation,
survival, and motility (1). mTOR does not seem to exert its major
functions as an independent entity but instead operates in cells at
least as two complexes, mTOR complex 1/2 (mTORC1/2; ref. 1).
mTORC1 consists of mTOR, mLST8 (also termed G-protein hsubunit–like protein, GhL, a yeast homologue of LST8), raptor
(regulatory-associated protein of mTOR; refs. 2–5), and PRAS40
(proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa; refs. 6–8), and is rapamycin

sensitive (2, 3). mTORC2 is composed of mTOR, mLST8, rictor
(rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR; refs. 9, 11), mSin1
(mammalian stress-activated protein kinase–interacting protein 1;
refs. 11–13), and protor (protein observed with rictor; ref. 14), and
is rapamycin insensitive (9, 10). mTORC1 regulates phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4E-BP1; refs. 2, 3) and functions
primarily in the control of translation initiation and nutrient
sensing. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at Ser473 (15) and regulates
the actin cytoskeleton (4, 9, 10).
Recent studies have placed tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)
1/2 as a modulator between PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB)
and mTOR (16–19). The formation of TSC1/2 complex facilitates
both their function and stability. The TSC1/2 complex itself
undergoes extensive positive and negative regulation. In response
to stimulation with growth factors or nutrients, activated Akt
can phosphorylate TSC2 in vitro and in vivo at several sites,
including Ser939/1130 and Thr1462 (16–19). Phosphorylation at
these sites may disrupt TSC1/2 complex stability/formation and
derepress mTORC1 signaling (16–19). On the other hand, in
response to low level of cellular energy, AMP kinase a (AMPKa)
is phosphorylated at Thr172 by the liver kinase B1 (LKB1;
refs. 20–22). Activated AMPKa can phosphorylate TSC2 at
Thr1227 and Ser1345, resulting in suppression of mTORC1
signaling (20–22). TSC2 has GTPase-activating protein (GAP)
activity toward the Ras family small GTPase Rheb (Ras
homologue enriched in brain; refs. 23–27). The Rheb/GTP
complex physically binds and stimulates mTORC1 activity (28).
TSC2 suppresses Rheb-mediated activation of mTORC1 by
stimulating its GTPase activity, keeping Rheb in an inactive
GDP-bound state (23–27). Therefore, mTORC1 seems to be
directly regulated through the action of the AMPKa-TSC
network.
Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 function through association with
its intracellular receptor FK-506 binding protein 12 (FKBP-12), and
this complex binds to the mTORs FKBP12-rapamycin binding
domain, resulting in raptor dissociation and inhibition of mTORC1
kinase activity (1). In response to stimuli, such as growth factors,
nutrients (2, 3), ATP (29), and phosphatidic acid (30), mTOR is
activated. Subsequently, mTORC1 phosphorylates 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46
and possibly Ser65 and Thr70; refs. 31, 32) and S6K1 (Thr389; ref. 33).
mTORC1 also negatively regulates Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A
(PP2A) activity (34). Whether mTORC1 regulates 4E-BP1 and S6K1
directly or indirectly through PP2A is controversial (1, 34).
Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin results in hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (31, 32). Subsequently, hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1
tightly binds to eIF4E and prevents association of eIF4E with eIF4G
and formation of the eIF4F initiation complex, thereby inhibiting
cap-dependent translation of mRNA. In addition, inhibition of
mTOR by rapamycin inactivates S6K1, blocking translation of

Disruption of mTORC1 by Curcumin

mRNA species containing 5¶ terminal oligopyrimidine tracts,
although this remains controversial (1). Consequently, rapamycin
inhibits cell proliferation and growth or other cellular events (1).
The polyphenol natural product curcumin (diferuloylmethane),
isolated from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa, has
garnered interest in recent years as a potential therapeutic agent
for the treatment and/or prevention of various disease processes,
including neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory-related diseases, and cancer (35, 36). Various in vitro cell culture and in vivo
animal studies have shown that curcumin is a potent inhibitor of
almost every major stage of carcinogenesis, including transformation, initiation, promotion, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis
(35). We are interested in investigating and identifying the
anticancer mechanisms of curcumin, in the hope of uncovering
its major target(s). Recently, we have shown that curcumin inhibits
proliferation/growth, motility, and survival of human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (37). In an attempt to deduce the molecular
mechanisms behind these effects, we studied the effect of
curcumin on the mTOR signaling pathway, because as stated
above, mTOR functions as a central controller of these processes.
Our preliminary studies revealed that curcumin, at physiologic
concentrations (2–5 Amol/L), inhibited mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in a panel of cell lines, including
those derived from skeletal muscle (Rh1, Rh30), prostate (DU145),
breast (MCF-7), cervical (HeLa; ref. 37), and colon (HT29; this
study) cancer cells, suggesting that this effect is not cell- or cancertype dependent. The results implicate that mTOR may in fact be
the major target of curcumin. Therefore, we set out to identify the
mechanisms by which curcumin inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Here,
we show that curcumin inhibits mTORC1 signaling independently
of the upstream kinases (IGF-IR and PDK1) and two negative
regulators (PP2A and the AMPK-TSC network), and instead directly
inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity by disrupting the mTOR-raptor
interaction.

Cell culture and transfection. Human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (Rh1
and Rh30; gifts from Dr. Peter J. Houghton, St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital, Memphis, TN) were grown in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640
(Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta
Biologicals). Wild-type (wt) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were kindly
provided by Charles J. Sherr (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN), whereas TSC2/ MEF cells
were a gift from David J. Kwiatkowski (Brigham and Women’s Hospital,

Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), respectively. HEK293, HT29, and HeLa
cells were from American Type Culture Collection. HEK293 cells were grown
in antibiotic-free DMEM (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS. HT29, HeLa, and MEF cells were grown antibiotic-free
DMEM in supplemented with 10% FBS. All cell lines were grown in a
humidified incubator at 37jC in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For experiments
where cells were deprived of serum, cell monolayers were washed with PBS
and incubated in the serum-free DMEM. The expression vector encoding
hemagglutinin (HA)–tagged dominant-negative (dn) protein phosphatase 2A
catalytic subunit (PP2Ac, Leu199!Pro; dn-PP2A; ref. 38) was generously
provided by Dr. Brian A. Hemmings (Friedrich Miescher Institut, Basel,
Switzerland). Rh1 cells were seeded at a density of 5  105 per well in six-well
plates and were transfected with the dn-PP2A expression plasmid by using
TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus) as directed by the manufacturer.
After 48 h of transfection, cells were transferred to 100-mm dishes and were
cultured for 2 wk at 37jC, 5% CO2 in growth medium containing 500 Ag/mL
geneticin (G418 sulfate, Mediatech). Drug-resistant cells were cloned and
expanded in growth medium containing 500 Ag/mL G418. Individual clones
were screened for expression of the mutant proteins as well as the
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling) using Western blot analysis.
Recombinant adenoviral constructs and infection of cells. Adenoviruses encoding HA-tagged dominant-negative AMPKa1 (Ad-dn-AMPKa)
was generated as described (39). Ad-dn-AMPKa and the control virus AdGFP encoding the green fluorescence protein (GFP) were amplified, titrated,
and used as described (40).
Lentiviral shRNA cloning, production, and infection. To generate
lentiviral shRNA to PP2A-A subunit, oligonucleotides containing the target
sequences were synthesized, annealed, and inserted into FSIPPW lentiviral
vector via the EcoR1/BamH1 restriction enzyme site. Oligonucleotides used
were as follows: sense, AATTCCCGGTCAAAGAGTTCTGTGAATGCAAGAGATTCACAGAACTCTTTGACCTTTTTG; antisense, GATCCAAAAAGGTCAAAGAGTTCTGTGAATCTCTTGCATTCACAGAACTCTTTGACCGGG.
Lentiviral shRNA constructs were made and used as described (40).
Western blotting. Cells were seeded in six-well plates in appropriate
medium containing 10% FBS for 2 h, followed by serum starvation in serumfree DMEM for 24 h. Standard protocols involved exposure to curcumin
(750 nmol/L–50 Amol/L) for 2 h before or after stimulation with 10 ng/mL
IGF-I for 1 h. In the okadaic acid experiments, cells were exposed to
100 nmol/L okadaic acid for 1 h before standard treatment. Western blot
analysis was performed as described (37).
Immunoprecipitation. Cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes in
appropriate medium containing 10% FBS for 2 d, followed by serum
starvation in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. Standard protocols involved
exposure to curcumin (750 nmol/L–50 Amol/L) for 2 h before or after
stimulation with 10 ng/mL IGF-I for 1 h. Cells were washed once in icecold 1 PBS, followed by lysis in appropriate buffer. For the mTOR
coimmunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in ice-cold 1 Chaps
buffer [40 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
10 mmol/L pyrophosphate, 10 mmol/L glycerophosphate, 50 mmol/L NaF,
1.5 mmol/L Na3VO4, 0.3% Chaps, protease inhibitor cocktail (1:1,000,
Sigma)]. Cell samples were subjected to freezing/thawing (dry ice/37jC
water bath) six times to fully disrupt cells. After clearing, 500 AL of cell
lysates were incubated overnight at 4jC with 1 Ag of goat anti-mTOR
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 30 AL of protein A/G plus
agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were washed
with 1 Chaps buffer four times and twice with mTOR immunoprecipitation wash buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl].
Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described above. For the TSC1/2
co-immunoprecipitation experiment, cells were lysed in ice-cold NP40 lysis
buffer [10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 50 mmol/L
NaF, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, protease
inhibitor cocktail (1:1,000, Sigma)]. After clearing, 500 AL of cell lysates

Results
Curcumin did not affect phosphorylation of IGF-IR or PDK1.
Recently, we have shown that curcumin inhibits mTORC1mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 and phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2481 (autophosphorylation site; ref. 41) and
Ser2448 (S6K1-mediated phosphorylation site; refs. 42, 37). Curcumin could inhibit these events by down-regulation of the activities
of the upstream kinases, such as IGF-IR and PDK1. To determine
whether curcumin affects IGF-IR activity, Rh1 cells were pretreated
with or without curcumin (20 Amol/L) for 2 h, and then stimulated
with or without IGF-I (10 ng/mL) for 1 h, followed by
immunoprecipitation with antibodies to IGF-IRh subunit (IGFRh,
p85) and immunoblotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine
(p-Tyr) and IGFRh. As shown in Fig. 1A, IGF-I stimulated tyrosine
phosphorylation of IGFRh, but curcumin did not affect basal or
IGF-I–stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IGFRh, suggesting
that curcumin did not affect IGFR activity.
To examine whether curcumin affects PDK1 activity, Rh1 cells
were pretreated with curcumin (0–40 Amol/L) for 12 h, stimulated
with IGF-I (10 ng/mL) for 1 h, followed by Western blot analysis
with p-PDK1 (Ser241) and PDK1, respectively. We found that
treatment with curcumin at high concentrations (>10 Amol/L) for
12 h inhibited cell growth and induced cell death, as evidenced by
reduction of h-tubulin (Fig. 1B) due to less cell number and floating
dead cells observed under a microscope (data not shown).
However, curcumin failed to alter phosphorylation of PDK1 or
total PDK1 protein level, indicating that curcumin did not affect
PDK1 activity. Therefore, curcumin inhibits mTOR signaling not
through inhibition of the upstream kinases, such as IGF-IR or
PDK1.
Curcumin inhibits mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of
S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in a PP2A-independent manner. PP2A, a
serine/threonine protein phosphatase, is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme composed of a catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), an A subunit (also
termed PR65), and members of the B-subunit families, such as B
(PR55), B¶ (PR61), B00 (PR72), and B (PR93/PR110; ref. 43). The
phosphatase activity of PP2Ac is modulated by its association with
PP2A-A and PP2A-B regulatory subunits (43). PP2A functions as a
key regulator of many cellular events, such as cell proliferation,
migration, and survival (43). Of interest, PP2A has been identified
as the phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of S6K1
and 4E-BP1, and inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin has been
shown to stimulate these PP2A-mediated events (34). Therefore, we
hypothesized that curcumin may inhibit mTORC1 signaling by
either directly activating PP2A activity and/or disrupting mTOR-

mediated inhibition of the enzyme. To this end, okadaic acid was
used. Because okadaic acid selectively inhibits PP2A without
inhibiting PP1 in intact cells at concentrations up to 100 nmol/L
(44), serum-starved Rh30 cells were pretreated with or without
okadaic acid (100 nmol/L) for 1 h, then exposed to curcumin (0–40
Amol/L) for 2 h, followed by stimulation with or without IGF-I
(10 ng/mL) for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, IGF-I markedly stimulated
phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in the absence or presence of
okadaic acid. Pretreatment of cells with okadaic acid increased
phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 but did not enhance IGF-I–
stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Probably, IGF-I

Disruption of mTORC1 by Curcumin

stimulation of mTOR resulted in maximal phosphorylation of S6K1
and 4E-BP1, and addition of okadaic acid failed to further enhance
their phosphorylation. Of interest, curcumin inhibited mTORC1mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 at a concentration of 2.5 Amol/L
in the absence or presence of okadaic acid in Rh30 cells (Fig. 2A).
Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 decreases its electrophoretic mobility
during SDS-PAGE. Curcumin also inhibited IGF-I–stimulated
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in Rh30 cells in the absence or presence
of okadaic acid in Rh30 cells, as indicated by the decrease in the
intensity of the uppermost band g and by the increase in the higher
mobility band a that corresponds to a less phosphorylated form of
4E-BP1. Similar data were observed in Rh1 and HT29 cells (data not
shown). The results suggest that curcumin may exert its inhibitory
effect on mTORC1 signaling independently of PP2A.
To confirm the above results, Rh1 clones stably expressing HAtagged dominant negative form of PP2Ac (Leu199!Pro; dn-PP2A;
ref. 40) were established (Fig. 2B, top). Because PP2A is known as a
negative regulator of the extracellular regulated protein kinase 1
and 2 (Erk1/2; ref. 45), as expected, expression of dn-PP2A resulted
in increase in the basal levels of phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Fig. 2B,
bottom), suggesting the dn-PP2A was functioning in the cells.

However, expression of dn-PP2A did not affect the inhibitory
effect of curcumin on mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of
S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in Rh1/dn-PP2A cells (Fig. 2C). We also wanted
to determine the effect of curcumin on PP2Ac down-regulated
cells. However, we failed to get viable PP2Ac down-regulated cells
using a series of shRNAs to PP2Ac. Because the PP2A-A subunit is
essential for PP2Ac activity (43), we next turned to down-regulate
the PP2A-A subunit using lentiviral shRNA. As shown in Fig. 2D,
down-regulation of PP2A-A by f80% increased IGF-I–stimulated
phosphorylation of S6K1 but did not affect curcumin inhibition of
mTORC1 signaling in HT29 cells. Taken together, our data strongly
support the notion that curcumin inhibits mTORC1 signaling in a
PP2A-independent manner.
Curcumin inhibits mTOR signaling independently of the
AMPK-TSC network. AMPK-TSC network negatively regulates
mTOR signaling (1). We therefore hypothesized that curcumin
might inhibit mTORC1 signaling by activation of AMPK-TSC
network. In response to the low level of energy, AMPKa is activated
by LKB1, leading to phosphorylation of TSC2 at Thr1227 and Ser1345,
an event that serves to facilitate its inhibitory effect on mTOR
signaling (1). Because no commercial antibodies are available for

phospho-TSC2 at Thr1227 and Ser1345, the LKB1-mediated phosphoAMPKa at Thr172 was used as a readout of AMPKa activity toward
TSC2. We observed that under serum starvation conditions, the
phosphorylation level of AMPKa was robust in HT29 cells.
Stimulation with IGF-I did not obviously alter the phosphorylation
level of AMPKa. Addition of low concentrations of curcumin (0–20
Amol/L) did not affect AMPKa phosphorylation status either
(Fig. 3A). However, treatment with curcumin at 40 Amol/L
strikingly increased AMPKa phosphorylation, an event that
correlates with the loss of both phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473)

and TSC2 (Thr1462), but well above the initially observed inhibition
of mTORC1 signaling (Fig. 3A). To address whether the inhibition
of mTORC1 signaling by curcumin is directly dependent on AMPK
kinase activity, we exposed Rh30 cells to the AMPK inhibitor
compound C. As shown in Fig. 3B, inhibition of AMPK with compound C alone marginally increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1
(lane 1 versus lane 2), but did not obviously enhance IGF-I–stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Curcumin (2.5–50 Amol/L)
potently inhibits the IGF-I–stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1
and 4E-BP1 in the absence and presence of compound C. These

Disruption of mTORC1 by Curcumin

data suggest that curcumin inhibits mTORC1 signaling probably
independently of AMPK functional kinase status.
To further confirm the above findings, Rh30 cells were infected
with adenoviral vectors encoding GFP (Ad-GFP, for control) and
the dominant-negative variant of AMPKa1 (Ad-dn-AMPK, Asp159!Ala). As shown in Fig. 3C, curcumin (2.5–50 Amol/L) potently
inhibited the IGF-I–stimulated phosphorylation of both S6K1 and
4E-BP1 in the cells infected with the control virus (Ad-GFP).
Consistent with our findings from the compound C experiment,
curcumin (2.5–50 Amol/L) also potently inhibited mTORC1
signaling in the cells expressing the dominant-negative variant of
AMPKa, indicating that the effects of polyphenol on mTORC1
signaling are mediated independently of AMPK kinase activity.
The formation of TSC1/2 complex is necessary for TSC2mediated inhibition of the Rheb-mTORC1 axis (1). Next, we
examined whether curcumin influences the TSC1/2 complex
formation. As shown in Fig. 4A, curcumin did not obviously alter
cellular protein expression of TSC1 and TSC2 in serum-starved Rh1
cells (top). A strong association of TSC1 with TSC2 was detected
under a serum-free condition by coimmunoprecipitation. As a
control, no Erk2 was found to be coimmunoprecipitated with TSC2
(bottom). Surprisingly, addition of IGF-I did not obviously affect
TSC1/2 interaction although robust phosphorylation of S6K1 and
4E-BP1 was stimulated (Fig. 3A). At low concentrations (0–10
Amol/L), curcumin treatment dose-dependently inhibited mTORC1
signaling (Fig. 3A), but seemed to have no effect on TSC1/2
complex association (Fig. 4A), suggesting that curcumin inhibits

mTORC1 signaling probably independently of TSC1/2. However, at
higher concentrations (20–40 Amol/L), curcumin slightly destabilizes TSC1/2 interactions (Fig. 4A), which was consistent with
decreased phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and TSC2 (Thr1462; Fig.
3A). To verify this finding, MEFs that contain a genomic knockout
of TSC2 (46) were used. As shown in Fig. 4B, IGF-I stimulated
phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in serum-starved wt MEFs
cells, but failed to enhance phosphorylation of the two proteins in
serum-starved TSC2/ cells, as knockout of TSC2 resulted in
constitutive activation of mTOR signaling (46). Curcumin (2.5–50
Amol/L) inhibited the IGF-I–stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1
and 4E-BP1 in both wt and TSC2/ MEF cells. These data suggest
that curcumin is not acting as a direct activator of TSC2 function
and actually can inhibit TSC function at high concentrations
(>20 Amol/L). Collectively, our data clearly indicate that curcumin
inhibits mTORC1 signaling independently of AMPK-TSC network.
Curcumin inhibits the activity of mTOR. Because the
upstream kinases (IGF-IR and PDK1) and two negative regulators
(PP2A and AMPK-TSC network) are not involved in curcumin
inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, we reasoned that curcumin might
directly inhibit mTORC1 activity. For this, we first examined
whether curcumin in vitro directly inhibits the mTORC1 activity.
Rh1 cells were stimulated with IGF-I for 1 h. mTOR was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using antibodies to mTOR. After
the isolated mTOR was incubated with curcumin (0–10 Amol/L)
in vitro for 2 h, recombinant 4E-BP1, as a substrate, was added
for in vitro kinase assay. We found that curcumin in vitro did not

Curcumin disrupts the stability of mTOR complexes. As
discussed, the major components of mTORC1 are mTOR, mLST8,
and raptor (2–5). Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 activity by
dissociating raptor from mTOR (2, 3). To investigate whether
curcumin inhibits mTORC1 activity by affecting the association of
mTOR with mLST8 and raptor, mTOR was immunoprecipitated
from IGF-stimulated and curcumin-treated Rh1 cells, followed by
immunoblotting with antibodies to mTOR, raptor, and mLST8,
respectively. Consistent with previous findings (2, 3), rapamycin, as
a positive control, did not affect binding of mLST8 or rictor to
mTOR, but dissociated raptor from mTOR (Fig. 6B). Of interest,
curcumin did not obviously affect cellular protein levels of mTOR,
raptor, rictor, and mLST8 in the cells (Fig. 6A), but dose
dependently dissociated raptor and rictor from mTOR, despite
no effect on the interaction of mLST8 with mTOR (Fig. 6B). At
low concentrations (2.5–5 Amol/L), curcumin almost completely
abolished the association of raptor with mTOR, and at high
concentrations (>40 Amol/L), curcumin also decreased the binding
of rictor with mTOR (Fig. 6B). Similar data were observed in HT29
cells (data not shown). This is correlated to curcumin inhibition of
mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at low
concentrations (2.5–20 Amol/L) and mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt at high concentrations (>40 Amol/L).

Discussion
Figure 5. Curcumin inhibits the kinase activity of mTOR. Serum-starved (24 h)
Rh1 cells, grown in 100-mm dishes, were treated with various concentrations of
curcumin or rapamycin (100 ng/mL) for 2 h, followed by stimulation with IGF-I
(10 ng/mL) for 1 h. mTOR was immunoprecipitated from whole-cell lysates with
antibodies to mTOR and the immunoprecipitates were used in mTORC1 in vitro
kinase assay using recombinant 4E-BP1 as a substrate (A), or in mTORC2
in vitro kinase assay using recombinant Akt as a substrate (B ), as described in
Materials and Methods. The kinase assay products were subjected to Western
blot analysis using the indicated antibodies.

affect mTORC1 activity because phosphorylation of 4E-BP1
(Thr37/46) was not altered when curcumin was present (data not
shown).
Next, we looked at the effect of curcumin on the kinase activity
of mTORC1 in cultured cells (in vivo). Rh1 or HT29 cells were
pretreated with curcumin (0–10 Amol/L), followed by stimulation
with IGF-I (10 ng/mL) for 1 h. mTOR was immunoprecipitated
from the cell lysates and the mTORC1 activity was determined by
in vitro kinase assay, using recombinant 4E-BP1 as a substrate, as
described above. As shown in Fig. 5A, curcumin dose-dependently
inhibited the mTORC1 activity in Rh1 cells, as evidenced by the
decreased phosphorylation levels of 4E-BP1 at Thr37/46 and Thr70,
respectively. This inhibition was correlated well with loss of S6K1
phosphorylation at Thr389 in whole-cell lysates, as detected by
Western blotting (ref. 37; Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed in
HT29 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we found that
curcumin, at high concentrations (>40 Amol/L), obviously inhibited
mTORC2 activity as well. This is evidenced by the findings that
mTOR immunoprecipitated from the cells treated with curcumin
(40–50 Amol/L) was not able to phosphorylate recombinant Akt (a
substrate of mTORC2) as much as that pulled down from the
control cells stimulated with IGF-I (Fig. 5B). As a control, treatment
of cells with rapamycin (100 ng/mL) for 2 h inhibited mTORC1
activity (Fig. 5A) but did not affect mTORC2 activity (Fig. 5B).
Therefore, our results reveal that curcumin inhibited mTORC1
activity at low concentrations (<20 Amol/L) and mTORC2 activity
at high concentrations (>40 Amol/L) in cultured cells.

mTOR has been recognized as a key therapeutic target for the
prevention and/or treatment of cancer and many other diseases
because of the fact that it functions as a central hub for the
regulation of numerous key cellular processes that are not only
critical for normal cellular function but are also absolutely
necessary for tumorigenesis (1). At the same time, a large amount
of effort and energy have been allotted to the study and
development of curcumin and its analogues as chemopreventative

Disruption of mTORC1 by Curcumin

and chemotherapeutic agents (35, 36). Despite the great effect that
both of these factors have exerted in the cancer research field,
mTOR and curcumin have only recently begun to cross paths with
each other (37, 47–49). After the publication of our initial
observation that curcumin targets mTOR-mediated pathways in
cancer cells (37), several recent studies have also shown that
curcumin targeting of the mTOR pathway represents a potentially
effective and powerful therapeutic tool for use against cancer
(47–49). Curcumin induces autophagy in malignant glioma cells
through inhibition of the Erk1/2 and mTOR signal transduction
pathways (47, 49). Furthermore, Li and colleagues. (48) show that
curcumin significantly down-regulates the expression of the p53
suppressor MDM2 in prostate cancer cells, partially through
inhibition of the mTOR pathway.
To identify the mechanism by which curcumin inhibits mTOR
signaling in cancer cells, first of all, we focused on the upstream
kinases, because curcumin inhibits mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1, as well as phosphorylation of
mTOR at Ser2481 (autophosphorylation site; ref. 41) and at Ser2448
(S6K1-phosphorylation site; refs. 42, 37). Our data implicate that
curcumin inhibits mTOR signaling not by inhibition of any of
the upstream kinases. This is supported by the findings that
curcumin did not affect the kinase activity of IGF-IR or PDK1, as
curcumin was not affecting their phosphorylation levels. Because
PI3K, which is negatively regulated by the phosphatase and
tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), lies
upstream of PDK1 and regulates phosphorylation of PDK1 (1),
we deduce that curcumin may not affect either PTEN or PI3K
activity.
Next, we considered the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP2A as a
potential target of curcumin because PP2A has been reported as
a major negative regulator of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 and itself also as a
major target of mTOR (34). We hypothesized that curcumin
inhibition of mTOR may suppress mTOR-mediated inhibition of
PP2A activity allowing the phosphatase to target mTOR substrates,
or curcumin may itself function as a direct allosteric activator of
PP2A, thus directly stimulating its activity regardless of mTOR
activity status. In our studies, we found that the compound
inhibited mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1
in the absence of PP2A activity as obtained through use of a PP2A
inhibitor (okadaic acid), down-regulation of PP2A-A subunit via
shRNA, or overexpression of a dominant-negative form of PP2Ac.
Therefore, our data suggest that curcumin inhibits mTORC1
signaling independently of PP2A.
The above findings led us to investigate whether curcumin
inhibits mTOR signaling by targeting AMPK-TSC network, a
major upstream negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling events
and itself a major target of mTORC2-mediated regulation (1). We
hypothesized that curcumin may alleviate Akt-mediated inhibition of TSC2 function, stabilize TSC1/2 interactions, or directly
stimulate TSC2 GAP activity. We also hypothesized that curcumin
may stimulate the kinase activity of AMPK, thereby leading to
activation of TSC2 and inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. However,
we found that the polyphenol did not obviously alter phosphorylation of TSC2 (Thr1462) or affect TSC1/TSC2 interaction at low
concentrations (2.5–10 Amol/L) sufficient to inhibit mTORC1.
Curcumin also could effectively inhibit mTORC1 signaling in wt
normal MEF cells as well as cells containing a genomic knockout
of TSC2. Our data further reveal that curcumin did not affect
phosphorylation of AMPKa (Thr172) at low concentrations
(2.5–20 Amol/L), but was able to inhibit mTORC1 signaling

www.aacrjournals.org

independently of AMPK kinase activity, as indicated by the ability
of the compound to block phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1
in the presence of an AMPK inhibitor (compound C), or a
dominant-negative variant of AMPKa. To our surprise, curcumin
could inhibit phosphorylation of TSC2 (Thr1462), cause a slight
destabilization of TSC1/2 interaction, and stimulate phosphorylation of AMPKa at high concentrations (>40 Amol/L), through
unidentified mechanism(s). Collectively, our results suggest that
curcumin inhibits mTORC1 signaling independently of the
AMPK-TSC network. Our data also implicate that at high
concentrations (>40 Amol/L), curcumin may act as an AMPKTSC stimulator that may be involved in the inhibition of the
mTORC2-Akt pathway.
After ruling out the upstream kinases and two major negative
regulators of mTOR signaling as the mediators of the effects of
curcumin, we decided to investigate mTOR itself as the possible
target of curcumin. Finally, we identified that curcumin blocked the
kinase activity of both the mTORC1 and the mTORC2 and that
these effects were the consequence of the disruption of raptormTOR association in the mTORC1 and the disruption of rictormTOR association in the mTORC2. This disruption of necessary
complex associations, however, occurs at different concentrations
of the compound, which is in good agreement with curcumin
inhibition of mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4EBP1 at low concentrations (2.5–20 Amol/L) and mTORC2-mediated
phosphorylation of Akt at high concentrations (>40 Amol/L). In our
studies, we found that down-regulation of raptor by RNA interference inhibited mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 and
4E-BP1, but increased mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt
in Rh30 cells. Curcumin could not inhibit phosphorylation of
S6K1 and 4E-BP1 synergistically in raptor down-regulated cells,
but was able to inhibit mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt.4
We also observed that overexpression of raptor was not able to
prevent curcumin inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in Rh1 or
Rh30 cells,4 which supports the notion that curcumin-dissociating
raptor from mTOR results in inhibition of mTORC1 signaling.
Clearly, more studies are needed to address how curcumin disrupts
the mTOR complexes. Particularly, it is of great importance to
know whether curcumin directly binds mTOR or a component of
the mTOR complexes to function as a specific mTOR inhibitor.
It has been reported that oxidants are involved in the activation
(50) or inactivation (3) of mTOR signaling. Alternatively, curcumin
may function as an antioxidant (35) to inhibit mTOR signaling. In
the studies, we also observed that curcumin might not induce cell
death until at higher concentrations (>10 Amol/L), which is
evidenced in the findings that curcumin (>10 Amol/L) treatment
for 12 h resulted in reduction of h-tubulin (Fig. 1B) due to less cell
number and floating dead cells observed under a microscope (data
not shown). Whether this is related to curcumin inhibition of rictor
binding to mTOR as well as mTORC2-mediated Akt phosphosphorylation remains to be defined.
In summary, here we have shown that curcumin inhibits
mTORC1 signaling independently of the upstream kinases (IGFIR and PDK1) and two negative regulators (PP2A or AMPK̃TSC
network) of mTOR and directly inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity by
disrupting the mTOR-raptor interaction. Our findings suggest that
curcumin may represent a new class of mTOR inhibitor.
