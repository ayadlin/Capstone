Abstract
Serine-threonine kinase CK2 is highly expressed and pivotal for survival and
proliferation in multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell
lymphoma. Here, we investigated the expression of α catalytic and β regulatory CK2
subunits by immunohistochemistry in 57 follicular (FL), 18 Burkitt (BL), 52 diffuse
large B-cell (DLBCL) non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and in normal reactive follicles.
In silico evaluation of available Gene Expression Profile (GEP) data sets from patients
and Western blot (WB) analysis in NHL cell-lines were also performed. Moreover,
the novel, clinical-grade, ATP-competitive CK2-inhibitor CX-4945 (Silmitasertib)
was assayed on lymphoma cells. CK2 was detected in 98.4% of cases with a trend
towards a stronger CK2α immunostain in BL compared to FL and DLBCL. No significant
differences were observed between Germinal Center B (GCB) and non-GCB DLBCL
types. GEP data and WB confirmed elevated CK2 mRNA and protein levels as well
as active phosphorylation of specific targets in NHL cells. CX-4945 caused a dosedependent growth-arresting effect on GCB, non-GCB DLBCL and BL cell-lines and it
efficiently shut off phosphorylation of NF-κB RelA and CDC37 on CK2 target sites.
Thus, CK2 is highly expressed and could represent a suitable therapeutic target in
BL, FL and DLBCL NHL.

Introduction

involved in cell cycle regulation, gene expression, protein
translation, DNA repair and programmed cell-death [2].
CK2 is also known to be a master regulator of embryonic
development, as it is involved in the mid-gestational
morphogenesis of heart, brain, pharyngeal arch and
somites [3, 4].
The central role of CK2 in several physiological
processes is paralleled by its deregulation in many (solid
and hematological) tumors [5, 6]. The over-expression
of such kinase has indeed been documented in prostate,
breast, lung, head and neck and colon carcinomas [7-13].

Protein kinase CK2 is a tetrameric enzyme,
composed by two catalytic (α and/or α’) and two
regulatory (β) subunits. CK2 and its orthologs are highly
conserved throughout evolution and are involved in the
phosphorylation of hundreds of protein targets (20% of
human phosphoproteome) [1].
The wide spectrum of possible phosphorylation
substrates justifies the pleiotropic roles of CK2 in cell
biology. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CK2 is

Lymphoma.
In these tumors, CK2 up-regulation has been associated
with increased tumor-cell survival and worse overall
prognosis. Of note, treatment of cancer cells with CX4945 (Silmitasertib, a novel recently developed clinically
grade ATP-competitive highly selective CK2-inhibitor)
can induce a significant reduction of cell-growth and
survival [11, 14, 15]. A common viewpoint on how CK2
sustains cancer cell growth relies on the “non oncogene
addiction” process, whereby cancer cells exploit the
advantages to keep up-regulated a critical “transversal”
protein able to propel different oncogenic pathways [6].
Among lymphoproliferative disorders, CK2 overexpression has been reported in both precursor lymphoid
(T-and B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) and mature
B-cell neoplasms [5]. The latter encompass B-Chronic
Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) [16, 17], Mantle Cell
Lymphoma (MCL) [18] and Plasma Cell Myeloma
(PCM) [18, 19]. As for carcinoma cell-lines, in vitro and
in vivo pre-clinical studies from our and other groups have
indicated that first generation CK2 inhibitors as well as the
newer CX-4945 have the potential to be novel therapeutic
tools for the treatment of high CK2-expressing B cell
tumors [16, 17, 20].
To fill a gap about to what extent is CK2 expressed
in NHL and as to whether its inhibition could affect
lymphoma cell viability, the present study evaluated CK2
mRNA and protein levels in the commonest forms of
B-cell NHL: Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Diffuse Large
B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt Lymphoma
(BL). CK2 protein expression was investigated by
immunohistochemistry in a series of 127 formalinfixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy samples. The
obtained data were subsequently confirmed by checking
CK2 mRNA levels from a repository of published cDNA
microarray data available in the Oncomine database [21].
Immunohistochemical and molecular results were further

validated by WB analysis on matched NHL cell-lines.
To explore the effects and a possible therapeutic role
for CK2 inactivation in the treatment of such lymphoid
malignancies, CX-4945 was used in in vitro cell viability
assays and WB analysis of the phosphorylation of CK2
target site on NF-κB RelA and CDC37, demonstrating
that CX-4945 is highly effective in inducing cell growth
arrest of GCB and non-GCB type DLBCL as well as BL
cell lines and in inhibiting CK2 kinase activity directed
towards pivotal signaling molecules.

Results
CK2α and CK2β protein expression in primary
NHL tissues
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that in
normal lymphoid tissue (tonsil) a moderate expression of
CK2α and CK2β is confined to the follicular area whereas
only faint reactivity could be detected in the mantle
zone (Figure S1 and [18]). Overall, 98.4% (125/127) of
the NHL cases analyzed disclosed some degree of CK2
expression (Figure 1, Table 1). Most of the lymphoma
samples displayed high nuclear/cytoplasmic protein
expression. In particular, a moderate to strong positivity
(high-expression group: score ≥2+) was documented in
more than 88% of cases (CK2α and CK2β score ≥2+:
88.2% (112/127) for both subunits) (details in Figure S2).
Compared to FL and DLBCL, BL was more
frequently associated with moderate-to-strong CK2α
expression (trend of association, Fisher’s exact test). In
particular, CK2α score ≥2+ was recorded in 94.4% (17/18)
of BLs and in 86.0% (49/57) and 88.5% (46/52) of FLs
and DLBCLs, respectively. Less marked differences were

As for DLBCL, CK2 subunits were moderately-tostrongly expressed in both GCB and non-GCB subtypes
[CK2α score ≥2+: 90.9% (20/22) of non-GCB DLBCL
and 86.7% (26/30) of GCB-DLBCL; CK2β score ≥2+:
90.9% (20/22) of non-GCB DLBCL and 90.0% (27/30)
of GCB-DLBCL; no statistically significant differences,

CK2 subunits were equally expressed in Bcl2positive and Bcl2-negative FL. In particular, moderate-tostrong positivity for CK2α was recorded in 85.7% (24/28)
of Bcl2-positive and in 86.2% (25/29) of Bcl2-negative
FL (no statistically significant differences, Fisher’s exact
test). Similar results were obtained for the CK2β subunit
(Table 1). No significant differences in CK2 expression
were recorded among FL of different grades (Table 2).

of the available study [22] confirmed the trend of the
immunohistochemical results, with high CSNK2A1,
CSNK2A2 and CSNK2B mRNA levels in all the
considered lymphoid tumors. In particular, BL featured
higher CSNK2A1 and CSNK2A2 expression compared
to both FL and DLBCL (Student’s t-test; p<0.001). The
same results were obtained for CSNK2B (Student’s t-test;
p<0.001) (Figure 2). Differences in the mRNA signatures
of FL and DLBCL were not statistically relevant.

WB analysis of CK2 protein expression in NHL
cell lines
To further confirm these findings, we performed
WB analysis of CK2α and CK2β expression in BL and
DLBCL cell-lines. Peripheral CD19-positive B-cells from
healthy donors were used as controls (Figure 3). WB
analysis confirmed CK2α and CK2β over-expression in
all the examined DLBCL and BL lines, with much higher
protein levels than in normal B-lymphocytes. Importantly,
WB also documented CK2β Ser209-phosphorylation,
which is a mark of CK2 activation by Cdc2/CyclinB
kinase [23], in all the cell-lines. Moreover, the presence of
a phosphorylated CK2-target such as Ser13 on the HSP90cochaperone CDC37 [24, 25] in all the examined cell-lines

GEP analysis of CK2 mRNA expression in NHL
To evaluate whether differences in CK2 protein
expression were also present at the mRNA level, the
mRNA signatures of both catalytic (CSNK2A1 and
CSNK2A2) and regulatory (CSNK2B) subunits were
assessed, by checking available gene expression profiles
(GEP) data sets in the Oncomine database [21]. GEP

positivity for the regulatory and catalytic CK2 subunits. In all the considered lymphoma subtypes, variable immunohistochemical positivity
(from score 1+ to score +3) was observed (H&E and immunoperoxidase stain; original magnification, x20).

provided clear evidence that CK2 is also functionally
active in DLBCL and BL cells (Figure 3).

and the amount of apoptosis was then measured after 24
hours by Annexin V staining and fluorescence activated
cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Remarkably, while DLBCL
cell-lines of both subtypes displayed a dose-dependent
induction of apoptosis, PBMC from healthy donors were
substantially spared by CX-4945 at the used concentrations
(Figure 4A). Furthermore, cell proliferation/viability, as
evaluated by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, demonstrated that
non-GCB (Figure 4B), GCB (Figure 4C) DLBCL celllines as well as BL Raji cells (Figure 4D) were sensitive
- even though to a different extent - to the growth-arresting
effect induced by CX-4945, in a dose-dependent fashion.

Effects of CK2 inhibition with CX4945 on NHL
cell line survival and viability
We finally tested if CK2 could be a suitable target
for harming B-cell lymphoma growth. Non-GCB type
DLBCL cell-line Oci Ly10, GCB type DLBCL cell-line
Oci Ly19 as well as normal peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC, controls) were cultured in the presence of
increasing concentrations of CX-4945 (2.5, 5 and 10 µM)

Of note, WB analysis revealed a marked down modulation
of the phosphorylation status of two CK2-specific target
sites, namely Ser529 on the NF-κB subunit p65/RelA [26]

investigate CK2 in a large series of FLs, DLBCLs and
BLs.
Our results clearly demonstrate that CK2 is widely
expressed in the vast majority of the commonest subtypes
of NHL. Of note, immunohistochemical and cDNA arrays
analyses indicate a trend for BL as associated with higher
CK2 protein levels compared to both FL and DLBCL
(Figure 1 and Figure 2). These data achieved on patients
specimens were further sustained by in vitro assays on
BL and DLBCL cell-lines. In particular, WB analysis
revealed constitutive CK2α and CK2β expression in all
the lymphoma cell-lines used, with more abundant protein
levels than in normal B-lymphocytes (Figure 3). WB also
provided hints about the functional status of CK2. The
detection of CK2β phosphorylation on Ser209 may indeed
be regarded as a compelling readout of CK2 activation by
the Cdc2/CyclinB complex, a feature likely to be linked
to high cell proliferative activity [23]. In addition, we
detected the presence of a known specific phosphorylated
target of CK2 (phospho-Ser13 on CDC37) in lymphoma

Discussion
NHL are a composite group of B-cell
lymphoproliferative disorders, encompassing both
indolent and aggressive tumors [27, 28]. Despite the
pathobiological and clinical features of such lymphomas
have been thoroughly investigated, prognosis and
therapeutic outcomes remain highly variable and the
search for novel therapeutic targets is still eagerly ongoing
[29-31]. The recent development of protein kinase CK2
inhibitors as anti-cancer agents [15, 32, 33] and the
evidence of CK2-expression in lymphocytes of reactive
germinal centers (this paper and [18]) prompted us to

cells, which provides further evidence of CK2 active
status as compared to normal B cells. Interestingly, Ser13phosphorylated CDC37 is a critical co-chaperone of
HSP90, which has been clearly shown to be essential for
proper folding of HSP90 client oncogenic kinases [34].
To note, CK2 mRNA and protein levels do not follow a
perfectly identical trend, since we observed less marked
differences in the expression of CK2 protein compared to
mRNA across the different NHL subtypes. This could be
due to various possibilities, for instance to the fact that the
transcription of CK2 mRNAs is differently regulated in
BL as compared to FL and DLBCL because of different
sets of transcription factors. Also, regardless the mRNA
levels, the CK2 subunits could be post-translationally
controlled in neoplastic B cells, causing their differential
levels within NHL subtypes. Further work will elucidate
this aspect.
From a practical viewpoint, the widespread
expression of CK2 limits its applicability to the routine
histopathological diagnosis of B-cell lymphomas. On the
other hand, the high levels and the constitutive activation
of CK2 pinpoint such kinase as an additional potential
target for the treatment of FL, DLBCL and BL. This
hypothesis, at least for DLBCL and BL, is sustained by
the results of cell viability assays after incubation with
the CK2-inhibitor, CX-4945 (Figure 4). In such assays,
lymphoma cell-lines demonstrated a dose- and timedependent response to CX-4945. Remarkably, CX-4945
efficacy was supported by a clear down modulation of
phospho Ser529 RelA and phospho Ser13 CDC37, two
well-known CK2 targets. Regarding this latter molecule,
since it is an essential co-chaperone of HSP90, it will be
interesting to test whether double targeting of HSP90
and CK2 would be synergic in causing NHL cell death,
similarly as in MM cells, like we recently demonstrated in
in vivo and in vitro models [20].
In conclusion, our work suggests that further
investigations on the pre-clinical and clinical applications
of CK2-inhibitors against DLBCL, BL and possibly FL are
worth pursuing. It also point to the rationale of performing
parallel studies on the role of CK2-regulated networks in
B-cell physiology and in B-cell tumor pathogenesis.

(28 cases of Bcl2-positive FL; 29 cases of Bcl2-negative
FL). The present series was enriched in Bcl2-negative
FLs to specifically investigate possible differences in
CK2-expression between Bcl2-positive and Bcl2-negative
cases. Distribution of FLs according to the histological
grade was as follows: (i) 13 cases of Grade 1 FL (Bcl2positive: 6 cases; Bcl2-negative: 7 cases); (ii) 26 cases of
Grade 2 FL (Bcl2-positive: 12 cases; Bcl2-negative: 14
cases); (iii) 18 cases of Grade 3 FL (Bcl2-positive: 10
cases; Bcl2-negative: 8 cases; all cases were Grade 3A).
For each lymphoma subtype, tissue microarray
(TMA) blocks were prepared, obtaining three tissue cores
from each original sample. Adequate positive (lymphoid
and thymic tissue) and negative (myocardium) controls
were also included.
None of the patients received radiation therapy or
chemotherapy prior to biopsy sampling and histological
evaluation. The institutional and international (Declaration
of Helsinki) ethics regulations governing research
conducted on human tissues were followed, and all
patients gave their informed consent.

Immunohistochemical analysis
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4 μmthick FFPE sections, using CK2α (EP1963Y, Epitomics,
CA, USA) and CK2β (6D5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA) monoclonal antibodies. Heat/EDTA-based
antigen retrieval methods were applied, as previously
described [18, 36]. Antigen detection was performed with
the Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit in an automated
immunostainer (Bond maX, Menarini, Italy) [18].
CK2α
and
CK2β
immunostain
was
semiquantitatively scored in a four-tiered scale, as follows:
score 0 = negative staining; score 1+ = weak positivity
or positive staining in <5% of tumor cells; score 2+ =
moderate positivity or strong positive staining in <50%
of cells; score 3+ = strong positive staining in >50%
of tumor cells. Immunohistochemical reactions were
independently scored by two investigators (MP and PB;
agreement k>0.8). In case of discrepancies, a consensus
opinion was rendered. For the statistical interpretation
of immunohistochemical data, scores 0/1+ and 2+/3+
were lumped in “low-expression” and “high-expression”
groups, respectively.

gift of Dr. F. Bertoni, Bellinzona, Switzerland. NU-DUL
were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 15% fetal bovine serum (FCS) + 2-Mercaptoethanol
(50mM; Invitrogen); OCI Ly10, OCI Ly3 and OCI Ly1
in IMDM 20% FCS + 2-Mercaptoethanol (50mM); OCI
Ly18 in RPMI 10% FCS + 2-Mercaptoethanol (50mM)
and OCI Ly19 in RPMI 10% + 2-Mercaptoethanol
(50mM) + MEM NEAA + sodium pyruvate. BL Raji cellline was purchased from ATCC and cultured in RPMI
20% FCS. Testing for Mycoplasma infection was carried
at a monthly basis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) and B lymphocytes from healthy donors were
obtained from peripheral blood as per standard Ficoll
Paque® protocol; B lymphocytes were purified using
CD19-coated magnetic MicroBeads according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi Biotech).

MTT assay
MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide) assay was performed in 96-well
plates using a CellTiter 96® kit (Promega). Briefly, 0.5 x
104 cells were plated in 96-well plates the day before the
experiment. At the end of the treatment with CX-4945 (48
hours), culture medium was removed and replaced with
100 ml of complete medium without phenol red + 50
ml of MTT to each well. During an incubation period of
1.5 hour at 37°C, the MTT salt is metabolically reduced
only by viable cells into an insoluble coloured formazan;
the absorbance/optical density was read and reported by
a microplate reader at 570 nm. Values are expressed as
percentage of viable cells compared with untreated cells,
considered as 100%. This assay was performed in parallel
with all cell experiments to exclude any artefact resulting
from differences in cell viability.

WB and antibodies
Whole cell extracts (WCE) were obtained by lysis
with 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2
mM EGTA supplemented with 0,5% Triton X-100 (SigmaAldrich), protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich),
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), 1 mM
phenyl-methyl-sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; Sigma-Aldrich),
1 μM okadaic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), dithiothreitol
(DTT; Fluka). Twenty to 50 μg of WCE were subjected
to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes and
immunoblotted with the following primary antibodies:
anti-CK2α (kindly provided by Dr S. Sarno, University
of Padua, Italy); anti-CDC37 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA) anti-phospho-Ser13 CDC37 (Abcam);
anti-CK2β (BD Biosciences, USA); anti-phospho-Ser209
CK2β (Assay Biotech) and anti-GAPDH (Ambion); antiRelA (Abcam) and anti-phospho-Ser529 RelA (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). As secondary antibodies:

Statistical analysis
Data were evaluated for their statistical significance
with the two-tail paired Student’s t test and differences
and correlations between groups were tested by applying
analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Fisher’s exact test
(immunohistochemical results). Pearson’s product moment
correlation test was also adopted in a specific analysis. P
values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
