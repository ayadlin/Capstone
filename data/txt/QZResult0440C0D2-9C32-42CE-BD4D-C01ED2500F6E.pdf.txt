Abstract
It has been shown that mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitors activate Akt while inhibiting mTOR
signaling. However, the underlying mechanisms and the effect
of the Akt activation on mTOR-targeted cancer therapy are
unclear. The present work focused on addressing the role of
mTOR/rictor in mTOR inhibitor-induced Akt activation and
the effect of sustained Akt activation on mTOR-targeted
cancer therapy. Thus, we have shown that mTOR inhibitors
increase Akt phosphorylation through a mechanism independent of mTOR/rictor because the assembly of mTOR/rictor
was inhibited by mTOR inhibitors and the silencing of rictor
did not abrogate mTOR inhibitor-induced Akt activation.
Moreover, Akt activation during mTOR inhibition is tightly
associated with development of cell resistance to mTOR
inhibitors. Accordingly, cotargeting mTOR and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling prevents mTOR inhibitioninitiated Akt activation and enhances antitumor effects both
in cell cultures and in animal xenograft models, suggesting an
effective cancer therapeutic strategy. Collectively, we conclude
that inhibition of the mTOR/raptor complex initiates Akt
activation independent of mTOR/rictor. Consequently, the
sustained Akt activation during mTOR inhibition will counteract the anticancer efficacy of the mTOR inhibitors. [Cancer

Introduction
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related serine/threonine kinase, plays a
central role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival, in
part by regulation of translation initiation, through interactions
with other proteins such as raptor [forming mTOR complex 1
(mTORC1)] and rictor [forming mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2);
refs. 1–3]. The best-characterized downstream effectors of mTORC1
are the 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) and the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1 (4E-BP1; ref. 1). In
response to mitogenic stimuli or nutrient availability, mTORC1 is
activated (4), leading to phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1, and
the subsequent enhanced translation of mRNAs that are critical for
cell cycle progression and proliferation (1).

PI3K/Akt signaling represents a major cell survival pathway. Its
activation has long been associated with malignant transformation
and apoptotic resistance (5, 6). It is generally thought that mTOR
(i.e., mTORC1) functions downstream of the PI3K/Akt pathway and
is phosphorylated (or activated) in response to stimuli that activate
the PI3K/Akt pathway (1, 7). However, the recent discovery of
mTORC2 as an Akt Ser473 kinase also places mTOR upstream of
Akt. Although mTORC2 is thought to be insensitive to rapamycin,
it has been shown that prolonged rapamycin exposure inhibits
mTORC2 assembly and Akt activity in certain types of cancer cells
(8). We and others have shown that mTOR inhibitors activate Akt
while suppressing mTORC1 signaling in different types of cancer
cell lines and clinical human tumor samples (9–11). Currently, it is
unclear how mTOR inhibitors activate Akt survival signaling.
mTOR signaling has recently emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for cancer therapy (1, 12). The potential applications
of mTOR inhibitors for treating various types of cancer have been
actively studied both preclinically and clinically. In the United
States, several phase II or III trials are ongoing that test the effects
of mTOR inhibitors on various cancers (1, 13, 14). A recent study
has shown encouraging results that the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779
improved overall survival among patients with metastatic renal cell
carcinoma (15).
In addition to the intrinsic resistance of cancer cells to mTOR
inhibition by rapamycin, cancer cells can acquire resistance to
rapamycin (16). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by
which cells become resistant to mTOR inhibitors such as
rapamycin has long been an interesting subject and may
eventually guide the development of successful mTOR-targeted
cancer therapy by avoiding or overcoming cell resistance to mTOR
inhibition.
The current study aimed at showing the relationship between
mTORC2 and mTORC1 inhibition-induced Akt activation, and
particularly the biological significance of Akt activation in mTORtargeted cancer therapy.

rabbit polyclonal rictor (BL2178) antibodies were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., respectively.
Cell lines and cell treatment. Human lung cancer cell lines and PC-3
cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The U937
cell line was provided by Dr. Yongkui Jing (Mount Sinai School of Medicine,
New York, NY). These cell lines were grown as described previously (9). The
rapamycin-resistant A549 cell line (A549-RR) was established by exposing
the rapamycin-sensitive A549 parental cells (A549-P) to gradually increased
concentrations of rapamycin from the initial 1 nmol/L to the final 20 Amol/L
over a 6-mo period. A549-RR cells were routinely cultured in complete
medium containing 1 Amol/L rapamycin. All treatments with mTOR
inhibitors were done in the respective media containing 5% fetal bovine
serum.
Western blot analysis. The procedures for preparation of whole-cell
protein lysates and for Western blotting were described previously (9, 17).
Immunoprecipitation. mTOR complexes were immunoprecipitated
with goat polyclonal mTOR (FRAP; N-19) antibody according to the same
procedure described previously (18, 19). At the end, the samples containing
an equal amount (20–50 Ag) of whole-cell protein lysates and immunoprecipitates from 0.5 to 1 mg cell lysates captured with protein A-Sepharose
were analyzed by Western blotting.
Gene knockdown by small interfering RNA. Control (nonsilencing)
small interfering RNA (siRNA), raptor siRNA that targets 5¶-AAGGCTAGTCTGTTTCGAAAT-3¶, and rictor siRNAs that target 5¶-AAGCAGCCTTGAACTGTTTAA-3¶ (rictor-1) and 5¶-AAACTTGTGAAGAATCGTATC-3¶

(rictor-2), respectively, were described previously (19) and synthesized from
Qiagen. The transfection of siRNA was conducted in a 12- or 24-well plate
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were treated
with DMSO and rapamycin for the given times and then subjected to
detection of the given proteins by Western blot analysis. In addition, we also
used lentiviral raptor, rictor, and scramble short hairpin RNAs (shRNA)
described previously (19), which were ordered from Addgene, Inc., and used
for stably knocking down raptor and rictor as described previously (19).
Growth inhibition assay. Cell number was estimated by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and the growth inhibition was calculated as previously
described (20).
Colony formation assay. Cells (single-cell suspension) were plated in
12-well plates at a density of 250 per well. On the second day, cells were
treated with the given agents. Every 3 d, the medium was replaced with
fresh medium containing the corresponding concentrations of the agents.
After a 10-d treatment, the medium was removed and cell colonies were
stained with crystal violet (0.1% in 20% methanol) and counted. Pictures
were also taken using a digital camera to record the result.
Cell cycle analysis. The procedure for analysis of cell cycle by flow
cytometry was described previously (21).
Lung cancer xenografts and treatments. Animal experiments were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory
University. Four- to 6-wk-old (f20 g of body weight) female athymic
(nu/nu) mice were ordered from Taconic and housed under pathogen-free

ad libitum. A549 cells at 5  106 in serum-free medium were injected s.c.
into the flank region of nude mice. When tumors reached certain size
ranges (100–500 mm3), the mice were randomized into four groups (n = 6/
group) according to tumor volumes and body weights for the following
treatments: vehicle control, formulated RAD001 (4 mg/kg/d, oral gavage)
and LY294002 in DMSO (25 mg/kg/d, i.p.), and the combination of RAD001
and LY294002. Tumor volumes were measured using caliper measurements
once every 2 d and calculated with the formula V = k(length  width2)/6.
After a 14-d treatment, the mice were sacrificed with CO2. The tumors were
then removed, weighed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed with formalin.
Certain portions of tumor tissues from each tumor were homogenized in
protein lysis buffer for preparation of whole-cell protein lysates as described
previously (20). Western blotting results were quantitated using Kodak
Image Station 2000R (Eastman Kodak Co.).
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical analysis on formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded nude mouse xenograft tissues was done using
Cytomation EnVision+ Dual Link System-HPR (DAB+; Dako North America,
Inc.) following the standard manufacturer’s protocol. The primary antibody
against p-Akt (S473) was purchased from R&D Systems and used as 1:500
dilution. The incubation time for the primary antibody was overnight
at 4jC.
Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences in p-Akt

Welch’s corrected t test when the variances were not equal by use of
GraphPad InStat 3 software (GraphPad Software). Data were examined as
suggested by the same software to verify that the assumptions for use of the
t tests held. Results were considered to be statistically significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Effects of prolonged treatment with mTOR inhibitors on Akt
phosphorylation are dose dependent. We and others previously
showed that rapamycin induces a rapid and sustained increase in
Akt phosphorylation in several types of cancer cells, including lung,
breast, and prostate cancer cells (9, 10). However, two recent
studies have shown that prolonged treatment with mTOR
inhibitors decreases Akt phosphorylation in certain cancer cell
lines (e.g., PC-3 and U937; refs. 8, 22). In this study, we further
examined the effects of RAD001 in comparison with rapamycin on
Akt phosphorylation in a group of lung cancer cell lines after a
prolonged treatment. Both RAD001 and rapamycin at 10 nmol/L
increased p-Akt levels while inhibiting p70S6K phosphorylation in
all of the cell lines after a 24-h treatment (Fig. 1A). We also treated
H157 and A549 lung cancer cells with 1 nmol/L RAD001 or
rapamycin for a prolonged period of time from 24 to 96 h and then

harvested the cells for analysis of Akt phosphorylation. As shown in
Fig. 1B, p-Akt levels remained elevated at all the tested times over
the prolonged period of time even when decreased p-p70S6K levels
returned at 96 h (i.e., RAD001 at 96 h). This result clearly shows that
mTOR inhibitors induce a sustained Akt activation in the tested
cell lines. We noted that p-p70S6K levels recovered at 96 h after
treatment with RAD001 but not with rapamycin (Fig. 1B). Because
we treated cells only once, it is likely that rapamycin may have a
longer half-life in cell culture than RAD001, resulting in better
efficacy than RAD001 in inhibiting mTOR signaling.
Moreover, we examined the effects of prolonged treatment with
rapamycin or RAD001 on Akt phosphorylation in two cell lines (i.e.,
PC-3 and U937), in which Akt phosphorylation was decreased by
prolonged treatment with rapamycin (8), in a more detailed way.

Previous studies used 100 nmol/L rapamycin (8) or >1,000 nmol/L
CCI-779 (22), which decreased p-Akt levels after a 24-h treatment.
In our study, we could repeat this result after both 24- and 48-h
treatments with 100 nmol/L rapamycin in PC-3 cells. However,
when the concentration of rapamycin was reduced to 1 nmol/L, we
consistently observed an increase in Akt phosphorylation at both
24- and 48-h treatments. Similar results were also obtained from
cells treated with RAD001 (Fig. 1C). In U937 cells, prolonged
treatment with either 1 nmol/L rapamycin or RAD001 clearly
increased the levels of p-Akt, although at 10 or 100 nmol/L they
decreased p-Akt levels (Fig. 1D). Similar results with RAD001 were
also observed in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1D). We noted that both
rapamycin and RAD001 at 1 nmol/L sufficiently inhibited
mTORC1 signaling evidenced by reduction of p-S6 or p-p70S6K

from the culture medium for at least 24 h before A549-RR cells were used in the experiments. D, the whole-cell protein lysates were prepared from A549-P and
A549-RR cells and then subjected to immunoprecipitation using mTOR antibody. Cell lysates and mTOR immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting.

levels (Fig. 1C and D). Thus, the effects of prolonged treatment
with mTOR inhibitors on Akt phosphorylation are clearly dose
dependent in these cell lines. We also noted that both rapamycin
and RAD001 at 1 to 100 nmol/L increased Akt phosphorylation at
Thr308 in a dose-dependent manner in PC-3 cells (see Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that mTOR inhibitors also activate
phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 kinase. We noted
that our data here on Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 by rapamycin
or RAD001 in PC-3 cells are different from previous report that
rapamycin at 100 nmol/L slightly decreased Akt phosphorylation at
Thr308 after a 24-h treatment (8). The reason for this inconsistency
is not clear but may be due to the different ways the cells were
treated by us and other investigators.
Rapamycin increases Akt phosphorylation accompanied
with inhibition of the assembly of mTORC2. We were interested
in the effects of rapamycin on the assembly of mTORC2 under the
conditions that Akt phosphorylation is increased. To this end, we
immunoprecipitated mTOR complexes from rapamycin-treated cell
lysates using a mTOR-specific antibody and then detected raptor
and rictor, respectively, in these immunoprecipitates by Western
blotting. In the tested cell lines exposed to 10 nmol/L rapamycin
for 24 h, the amounts of raptor and particularly rictor in mTOR
complexes were substantially reduced, indicating that both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 were inhibited in cells exposed to
rapamycin, although the levels of p-Akt remained elevated in these
cell lines (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we detected mTORC2 in PC-3 cells
after a prolonged treatment with rapamycin at either 1 nmol/L
(which increases p-Akt levels) or 100 nmol/L (which decreases
p-Akt levels) as we presented in Fig. 1C. Rapamycin at both 1 and
100 nmol/L effectively decreased the levels of rictor in mTOR
complexes precipitated by a mTOR antibody (i.e., inhibition of
mTORC2 assembly), albeit with differential effects on alteration of
Akt phosphorylation. These results clearly indicate that rapamycin
inhibits mTORC2 assembly regardless of its differential effects on
regulation of Akt phosphorylation.
mTOR inhibitor-induced Akt activation is secondary to
mTORC1 inhibition and cannot be abrogated by inhibition of
mTORC2. To dissect the roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in mTOR
inhibitor-induced Akt phosphorylation, we knocked down raptor
and rictor expression, which would result in disruption of
mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively. In both Calu-1 and H157
cells, raptor knockdown alone increased p-Akt levels as did
rapamycin without altering the levels of p-p70S6K (Fig. 2C, lanes 3
and 11), indicating that disruption of mTORC1 activates Akt. On
treatment with rapamycin, p-Akt levels were even further
increased (lane 4 versus lane 3 and lane 12 versus lane 11), likely
due to additional inhibition of the activity of the residual
mTORC1. Silencing of rictor using two different siRNAs slightly
decreased basal levels of p-Akt (lanes 5, 7, 13, and 15). However,
rapamycin still increased p-Akt levels in these cells (lanes 5–8 and
lanes 13–16). Similar results were also generated from H157 cells
exposed to rapamycin for 24 h, in which raptor and rictor were
stably silenced using lentiviral raptor and rictor shRNAs,
respectively. Under such conditions, stable silencing of raptor
did reduce basal levels of p-p70S6K (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these
results indicate that rapamycin-mediated increase in Akt phosphorylation is secondary to mTORC1 inhibition independent of
mTORC2. Because transient knockdown of raptor in our system
did not apparently decrease p-p70S6K but substantially increased
p-Akt levels, these results also suggest that p-Akt is more
susceptible than p-p70S6K to modulation by mTOR inhibition,

www.aacrjournals.org

suggesting that mTOR inhibition-induced Akt phosphorylation is
unlikely a secondary event to p70S6K inhibition.
The rapamycin-resistant cell line exhibits increased levels
of p-Akt with disrupted mTORC2. To further show the effect of
long-term mTOR inhibitor exposure on Akt activity, we established
a rapamycin-resistant cell line named A549-RR by exposing
rapamycin-sensitive A549 cells (A549-P) to gradually increased
concentrations of rapamycin from the initial 1 nmol/L to the final
20 Amol/L over a 6-month period. A549-RR cells were resistant not
only to rapamycin but also to RAD001 (Fig. 3A) and were at least
10,000-fold more resistant to either rapamycin or RAD001 than
A549-P cells by comparing their IC50s. The A549-RR cell line had a
comparable growth rate to that of A549-P (Fig. 3B). To maintain
the acquired resistance to rapamycin, we routinely cultured A549RR cells in complete medium containing 1 Amol/L rapamycin.
Twenty-four hours before each experiment, rapamycin was
withdrawn from the medium. We observed that A549-RR cells
had much higher basal levels of p-Akt than A549-P cells; these high
levels of p-Akt were not increased further by either rapamycin or
RAD001 (Fig. 3C). In A549-P cells, rapamycin at either 1 nmol/L or
1 Amol/L increased p-Akt levels. The total levels of Akt in both
A549-P and A549-RR cell lines were not altered (Fig. 3C, bottom).
Both glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK3h) and FOXO3a are wellknown substrates of Akt. The basal levels of phosphorylated
GSK3h (p-GSK3h) but not phosphorylated FOXO3a were accordingly elevated in A549-RR cells compared with those in A549-P
cells (Fig. 3C). We noted that p-p70S6K levels were not decreased
by rapamycin or RAD001 in A549-RR cells, although the p-S6 levels
were slightly decreased by high concentration (i.e., 1 Amol/L) of
rapamycin or RAD001 (Fig. 3C). There results indicate that
A549-RR cells lose responses to mTOR inhibitor-mediated inhibition of mTORC1-p70S6K signaling while exhibiting increased
levels of p-Akt.
It has been suggested that down-regulation of 4E-BP1 is
associated with rapamycin resistance (23). Therefore, we compared
the levels of 4E-BP1 and its phosphorylation between A549-P and
A549-RR cell lines. As presented in Fig. 3C, we did not find an
obvious difference in basal levels of 4E-BP1 between A549-P and
A549-RR cell lines. The expression levels of 4E-BP1 were not altered
by mTOR inhibitors in both cell lines. We found that both cell
lines had comparable levels of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1).
p-4E-BP1 levels were reduced by both low (1 nmol/L) and high (1
Amol/L) concentrations of rapamycin or RAD001 in A549-P cells
but not in A549-RR cells, except for the high dose (1 Amol/L) of
rapamycin. These results suggest that 4E-BP1 levels cannot account
for cell resistance to mTOR inhibitors in our system.
Following these studies, we determined whether the assembly of
mTOR complexes was altered in A549-RR cells. Therefore, we
compared the levels of mTORC1 and mTORC2 between A549-P and
A549-RR cells. The total levels of mTOR, raptor, and rictor in cell
lysates were not altered in A549-RR cells; however, the amounts of
raptor and rictor in mTOR complexes precipitated by a mTOR
antibody were strikingly decreased (Fig. 3D), indicating that both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 were inhibited in A549-RR cells. Under
such circumstances, the levels of p-Akt (S473), p-Akt (T308), and
p-GSK3h (S9) were elevated in cell lysates from A549-RR cells
compared with those from A549-P cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that
A549-RR cells have increased Akt activity, albeit with disrupted
mTORC2.
Sustained Akt activation is associated with development of
cell resistance to mTOR inhibitors. We were interested in the

biological significance of sustained Akt activation in mTORtargeted cancer therapy. To this end, we took advantage of the
rapamycin-resistant cell line (i.e., A549-RR) that has elevated levels
of p-Akt as described above. We first determined whether the
acquired rapamycin resistance in A549-RR cells was reversible. To
do so, we cultured A549-RR cells in rapamycin-free complete
medium for up to 5 months and monitored cell responses to mTOR
inhibitors and p-Akt levels at 1-month intervals. At 2 months after
rapamycin withdrawal, the cell line, which was named A549-RR2W,
was slightly more sensitive than A549-RR cells to either rapamycin
or RAD001 (Fig. 4A). Even at 3 or 4 months after rapamycin
withdrawal, the cells (i.e., A549-RR3W and A549-RR4W) were still
partially resistant to mTOR inhibitors, although their sensitivities
to rapamycin or RAD001 were increased compared with A549RR2W cells (data not shown). After a 5-month withdrawal of
rapamycin, the cell line, which was named A549-RR5W, was as
sensitive as A549-P cells to both rapamycin and RAD001 (Fig. 4B),
indicating a complete restoration of rapamycin sensitivity.
Collectively, these results indicate that the acquired rapamycin
resistance in A549 cells is reversible, although it sustains for over
5 months.
Accordingly, we examined basal p-Akt levels and their modulation by mTOR inhibitors in rapamycin-resistant cell lines during

rapamycin withdrawal. After a 2-month withdrawal of rapamycin,
we found that the basal levels of p-Akt in A549-RR2W cells were
still much higher than that in A549-P cells and were only increased
by high concentrations of rapamycin or RAD001 (i.e., 1 Amol/L;
Fig. 4C). The basal levels of p-p70S6K in A549-RR2W and A549-P
cells were comparable and could be effectively inhibited by both
rapamycin and RAD001. Similarly, the p-S6 levels in A549-RR2W
and A549-P cells were also comparable and inhibited by mTOR
inhibitors (Fig. 4C). After 5-month withdrawal of rapamycin when
cell sensitivity to rapamycin is fully restored, we noted that p-Akt
levels in A549-RR5W cells were as low as those in A549-P cells
(Fig. 4D). On treatment with rapamycin or RAD001, p-Akt levels
were substantially increased in A549-RR5W cells as was observed in
A549-P cells (Fig. 4D). As we already showed in A549-RR2W cells,
p-p70S6K levels in A549-RR5W cells were comparable with those
in A549-P cells and could be effectively decreased by rapamycin or
RAD001 (Fig. 4D). Collectively, our results clearly indicate that
sustained Akt activation (i.e., increase in p-Akt levels) during
mTOR-targeted cancer therapy is associated with cell resistance
to mTOR inhibitors.
To further show this association, we examined whether enforced
reduction of p-Akt levels by Akt siRNA alter cell sensitivity to
rapamycin. To this end, we decreased p-Akt levels by knocking

(C and D). A549-RR cells were cultured in complete medium without rapamycin for 2 and 5 mo to generate A549-RR2W and A549-RR5W cell lines, respectively.
A549-RR2W and A549-RR5W cell lines were then used for the experiments. A and B, the indicated cell lines were plated in 96-well plates and then treated with

and subsequent Western blot analysis.

Enhancing mTOR-Targeted Cancer Therapy

Figure 5. Combination of RAD001 and LY294002 augments growth inhibition of lung cancer cells in cell culture (A and B ) and in nude mice (C and D ). A, the individual
cell lines, as indicated, were seeded in 96-well plates. On the second day, they were treated with the indicated concentrations of RAD001 (RAD ) alone, 2 Amol/L
LY294002 alone, and their respective combinations. After 3 d, plates were subjected to determination of cell number using a SRB assay. Columns, mean of four
replicate determinations; bars, SD. B, H460 cells at a density of f250 per well were seeded in 12-well plates. On the second day, cells were treated with the
indicated concentrations of RAD001 alone, 2.5 Amol/L LY294002 alone, and their respective combinations. The same treatments were repeated every 3 d.
After 10 d, the plates were stained for the formation of cell colonies with crystal violet dye. The picture of the colonies was then taken using a digital camera.
C and D, four groups of mice with either A549 (C ) or H460 (D ) xenografts were treated with vehicle control, RAD001 alone, LY294002 (LY ) alone, and RAD001
plus LY294002 on the same day after grouping. After 14 d, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were removed. Tumor sizes were measured once every 2 d.

down the levels of total Akt using Akt siRNA and then examined its
effect on cell sensitivity to rapamycin. As presented in Supplementary Fig. S2, silencing of Akt by Akt siRNA substantially
reduced the levels of p-Akt (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Accordingly,
these cells were much more sensitive than control siRNAtransfected cells to rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. S2B), indicating
that enforced reduction of p-Akt levels restores cell sensitivity to
rapamycin. Thus, these results further support the notion that
sustained increase in p-Akt levels is associated with the
development of cell resistance to mTOR inhibitors.

The rapamycin-resistant cell line retains sensitivity to PI3K
inhibitors. Because of the increased levels of p-Akt in A549-RR
cells, we determined whether A549-RR cells were cross-resistant to
PI3K inhibitors. A549-RR cells responded as well as A549-P cells
to either LY294002 or wortmannin in terms of a 3-day monolayer
culture assay (Supplementary Fig. S3A). By a long-term (10-day)
colony formation assay, we found that LY294002 effectively
inhibited the growth of both A549-P and A549-RR cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). At the tested concentrations of up to 15 Amol/L,
LY294002 failed to induce apoptosis in either A549-P or A549-RR

cells by examining cell morphologic changes and analysis of sub-G1
populations (data not shown). However, LY294002 induced G1
arrest in both A549-P and A549-RR cells with comparable potencies
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). Moreover, we compared the effects of
LY294002 on p-p70S6K and p-Akt in A549-P and A549-RR cells and
found that LY294002 effectively decreased the levels of not only
p-p70S6K and p-S6 but also p-Akt in both cell lines, although
A549-RR cells had very high basal levels of p-Akt (Supplementary
Fig. S3D). Collectively, these results indicate that A549-RR cells do
not exhibit cross-resistance to PI3K inhibitors.

Cotargeting mTOR and PI3K/Akt signaling augments inhibition of tumor growth. Given that sustained Akt activation is
associated with development of cell resistance to mTOR inhibitors,
whereas mTOR inhibitor-induced Akt activation was suggested to
be PI3K dependent (9), it was plausible to speculate that blockage of mTOR inhibitor-induced Akt activation by a PI3K inhibitor
would enhance the anticancer efficacy of the mTOR inhibitors and
prevent development of cell resistance to mTOR inhibitors. Thus,
we examined the effects of RAD001 combined with LY294002 on
the growth of lung cancer cells in cell culture. The RAD001 and

Enhancing mTOR-Targeted Cancer Therapy

LY294002 combination exhibited growth-inhibitory effects that are
greater than that caused by each single agent in a 3-day monolayer
culture (Fig. 5A). In the long-term colony formation assay, we
obtained similar results. This combination worked better than
either single agent in decreasing colony size and number (Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, we tested the effects of the combination of RAD001
and LY294002 on the growth of lung cancer xenografts in nude
mice. In agreement with the results in cell cultures, the
combination of RAD001 and LY294002 exhibited a significantly
greater effect than RAD001 or LY294002 alone in inhibiting the
growth of A549 xenografts (P < 0.001; Fig. 5C). During the 2-week
period of treatment, the tumor sizes in mice receiving both RAD001
and LY294002 were smaller in comparison with other groups
receiving either vehicle or single-agent treatment (Fig. 5C),
indicating an effective anticancer efficacy for the combination
treatment. In a H460 xenograft model, we began treatments with
relatively larger tumors (in average 300–400 mm3). Both RAD001
and LY294002 alone failed to achieve significant effects on
inhibiting the growth of tumors; however, the combination of
RAD001 and LY294002 significantly inhibited the growth of H460
xenografts compared with control (P < 0.05 or 0.01; Fig. 5D).
Collectively, these results clearly show that cotargeting mTOR and
PI3K/Akt signaling exhibits enhanced anticancer efficacy.
Cotargeting mTOR and PI3K/Akt signaling enhances inhibition of mTORC1 signaling while preventing Akt phosphorylation in vivo. We also determined whether continuous RAD001
treatment in cancer xenograft models led to an increase in Akt
phosphorylation as we observed in cell cultures. By Western blot
analysis, we detected p-Akt levels in tumors exposed to RAD001 for
14 days and found that p-Akt levels were significantly increased
(P < 0.05) in the RAD001-treated group compared with the vehicle
control group in both A549 and H460 xenografts (Fig. 6A). As
expected, p-Akt levels in tumors exposed to the combination of
RAD001 and LY294002 were not increased (Fig. 6A). Immunohistochemical analysis of p-Akt in H460 xenografts also showed
that p-Akt levels were increased in RAD001-treated tumors but
not in tumors exposed to the combination treatment of RAD001
and LY294002 (Fig. 6C). Thus, these results clearly indicate that
continuous treatment of lung tumors with a mTOR inhibitor in
nude mice leads to an increase in Akt phosphorylation and this
increase can be abrogated by inclusion of a PI3K inhibitor.
Moreover, we determined whether the presence of LY294002
affected the inhibitory effect of RAD001 on mTORC1 signaling in
tumor tissues. As presented in Fig. 6B, RAD001 alone significantly
decreased the levels of p-S6 (P < 0.001), indicating that RAD001
indeed inhibits mTORC1 signaling; however, the presence of
LY294002 further reduced the levels of p-S6, which were
significantly lower than those in tumors exposed to RAD001
alone (P < 0.05 or 0.01). Thus, these results indicate that
cotreatment of tumors with a mTOR inhibitor (e.g., RAD001)
and a PI3K inhibitor (e.g., LY294002) not only blocks RAD001induced Akt phosphorylation but also exhibits an enhanced effect
on inhibiting mTORC1 signaling.

Discussion
In the current study, we further showed that prolonged treatment
with either rapamycin or RAD001 increased p-Akt levels in several
human lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 1). A549-RR cells, which were
routinely cultured in the presence of 1 Amol/L rapamycin, still
exhibited increased levels of p-Akt compared with the parental A549

www.aacrjournals.org

cells (Fig. 3). Moreover, we detected significantly increased levels of
p-Akt in lung cancer xenografts exposed to RAD001 for 14 days
(Fig. 6). In current studies, we used 1 or 10 nmol/L of rapamycin or
RAD001, which is lower than concentrations (100 or >1,000 nmol/L)
used in other studies, showing that prolonged treatment with a
mTOR inhibitor decreases p-Akt levels (8, 22). At 100 nmol/L (or
even at 10 nmol/L), both rapamycin and RAD001 indeed decreased
p-Akt levels after a 24- or 48-h treatment in PC-3, U937, and Jurkat
cells as reported (8, 22). However, both rapamycin and RAD001 at
1 nmol/L consistently increased p-Akt levels even after a 48-h
exposure in these cell lines (Fig. 1). Thus, it seems that there are two
types of cancer cells: one type exhibits increased levels of p-Akt
after a prolonged treatment with a mTOR inhibitor regardless of
concentrations (e.g., A549 and H157 cells), whereas another type
shows dose-dependent alterations in p-Akt levels after prolonged
treatment with a mTOR inhibitor (e.g., PC-3 and U937 cells). In
the latter cell type, low doses (e.g., 1 nmol/L) of mTOR inhibitors,
which sufficiently block mTORC1 signaling (9), clearly increase
p-Akt levels.
It has been suggested that mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive
(18), although it can be inhibited by prolonged rapamycin
treatment (8). It has been suggested that an equilibrium may exist
between mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes (7). Therefore, it is
possible that inhibition of mTORC1 by a mTOR inhibitor somehow
shifts the equilibrium to favor or facilitate formation and activation
of mTORC2, leading to increase in Akt phosphorylation. In our
study, we found that a prolonged treatment with rapamycin (i.e.,
24 h) inhibited not only mTORC1 but also mTORC2 (e.g., H157 and
A549) with increased Akt phosphorylation in all three lung cancer
cell lines (Fig. 2A). In rapamycin-resistant A549-RR cells where
p-Akt levels were increased, the assembly of both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 was also clearly inhibited (Fig. 3D). Thus, our results
clearly indicate that p-Akt levels can be increased under the
condition that mTORC2 activity is inhibited.
Although mTORC2 has been recently shown to be an Akt Ser473
kinase (19), our results indicate that mTOR inhibitor-induced Akt
phosphorylation is unlikely to be mediated by mTORC2 because it
is inhibited during mTOR inhibitor treatment. This notion is
further supported by our findings that disruption of mTORC2 by
knocking down rictor did not block rapamycin-induced Akt
phosphorylation (Fig. 2). In agreement with previous findings that
raptor knockdown increases Akt phosphorylation (19), we also
observed that inhibition of mTORC1 by silencing raptor was
sufficient to increase Akt levels in our cell lines tested. These results
indicate that mTOR inhibitor-induced Akt activation is the
consequence of mTORC1 inhibition. Collectively, we conclude that
mTOR inhibitors induce Akt activation through a mTORC1dependent mechanism independent of mTORC2.
It is well documented that PI3K/Akt represents a major survival
pathway that is often associated with resistance to cancer therapy
(24–26). The biological significance of mTOR inhibitor-induced Akt
activation in mTOR-targeted cancer therapy is unclear. In our
study, we observed that p-Akt levels were drastically increased in
the rapamycin-resistant cell line (A549-RR). Moreover, when the
selective pressure (i.e., rapamycin) was removed, the acquired high
levels of p-Akt remained for a long period of time and were tightly
associated with cell resistance to mTOR inhibitors. When the
sensitivity of rapamycin-resistant (A549-RR) cells to mTOR
inhibitors was fully restored after a 5-month removal of rapamycin,
p-Akt levels dropped to normal levels comparable with those in
rapamycin-sensitive parental cells (A549-P; Fig. 4). Additionally,

enforced reduced p-Akt levels by silencing total Akt levels with Akt
siRNA increase cell sensitivity to rapamycin (see Supplementary
Fig. S2). Thus, our results suggest a critical role of Akt activation in
the development of cell resistance to mTOR inhibitors. Although
we suggest the association between sustained Akt activation and
development of acquired resistance to mTOR inhibitors, the
mechanistic insights into how sustained Akt activation negatively
regulates the efficacies of the mTOR inhibitors are still unclear and
need further investigation.
PI3K/Akt works upstream of mTORC1 and regulates mTORC1
activity. Therefore, inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling using PI3K
inhibitors should affect mTORC1 activity as well. Moreover, mTOR
is a PI3K-related serine/threonine kinase, and its activity can be
directly inhibited by the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin
(27, 28). Thus, it has been proposed that PI3K inhibitors may share
similar signaling pathways with rapamycin, such as mTOR/p70S6K,
to exert their biological function (27). If PI3K inhibitors suppress
cell growth solely through inhibition of mTOR signaling, cells
resistant to rapamycin should be cross-resistant to PI3K inhibitors
as was seen with RAD001. In our study, LY294002 or wortmannin
was equally effective in inhibiting the growth of A549-P and A549RR cells. Moreover, LY294002 induced G1 arrest in both A549-P and
A549-RR cells with comparable potencies. We also found that
LY294002 effectively decreased the levels of p-p70S6K, p-S6, and
p-Akt in both A549-P and A549-RR cells (see Supplementary
Fig. S3). Together, these results indicate that rapamycin resistance
does not interfere with the action of PI3K inhibitors, suggesting
that mTOR and PI3K inhibitors exert their biological functions
through different mechanisms or PI3K inhibitors suppress cell
growth through other mechanisms in addition to inhibition of
mTOR signaling.
Rapamycin resistance is an important subject of mTOR-targeted
cancer therapy in the clinic. Our finding that rapamycin-resistant
cells retain sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors has important clinical

implications. To overcome or avoid cell resistance to mTOR
inhibitors during mTOR-targeted cancer therapy, combination of a
mTOR inhibitor with a PI3K inhibitor or intermittent use of a PI3K
inhibitor and a mTOR inhibitor may be good approaches. Indeed,
our results clearly show that RAD001 combined with LY294002
exhibited enhanced inhibitory effects on the growth of human lung
cancer cells in cell cultures (Fig. 5). Importantly, the RAD001 and
LY294002 combination worked better than each single agent alone
in inhibiting the growth of human lung cancer xenografts in nude
mice (Fig. 5), indicating an enhanced anticancer activity in vivo. As
expected, treatment of xenografts with RAD001 increased p-Akt
levels, which could be abrogated by cotreatment with LY294002.
Besides, we found that RAD001 plus LY294002 also exerted an
enhanced effect on reduction of p-S6 levels, indicating that
inhibition of PI3K/Akt enhances the effect of the mTOR inhibitor
on inhibition of mTORC1 signaling (Fig. 6). Collectively, our results
validate the strategy for cancer therapy by cotargeting mTOR and
PI3K/Akt signaling and warrant clinical evaluation of this strategy
for cancer therapy.
