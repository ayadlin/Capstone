ABSTRACT
Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial adult tumor. All
Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-associated meningiomas and ~60% of sporadic
meningiomas show loss of NF2 tumor suppressor protein. There are no effective
medical therapies for progressive and recurrent meningiomas. Our previous work
demonstrated aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling that led to ongoing clinical
trials with rapamycin analogs for NF2 and sporadic meningioma patients. Here we
performed a high-throughput kinome screen to identify kinases responsible for
mTORC1 pathway activation in NF2-deficient meningioma cells. Among the emerging
top candidates were the mTORC2-specific target serum/glucocorticoid-regulated
kinase 1 (SGK1) and p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). In NF2-deficient meningioma
cells, inhibition of SGK1 rescues mTORC1 activation, and SGK1 activation is sensitive
to dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014, but not to rapamycin. PAK1 also leads to
attenuated mTORC1 but not mTORC2 signaling, suggesting that mTORC2/SGK1
and Rac1/PAK1 pathways are independently responsible for mTORC1 activation in
NF2-deficient meningiomas. Using (CRISPR)-Cas9 genome editing, we generated
isogenic human arachnoidal cell lines (ACs), the origin cell type for meningiomas,
expressing or lacking NF2. NF2-null CRISPR ACs recapitulates the signaling of NF2deficient meningioma cells. Interestingly, we observe increased SGK1 transcription
and protein expression in NF2-CRISPR ACs and in primary NF2-negative meningioma
lines. Moreover, we demonstrate that the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor, AZD2014
is superior to rapamycin and PAK inhibitor FRAX597 in blocking proliferation of
meningioma cells. Importantly, AZD2014 is currently in use in several clinical trials
of cancer. Therefore, we believe that AZD2014 may provide therapeutic advantage
over rapalogs for recurrent and progressive meningiomas.

INTRODUCTION

vestibular schwannomas, intracranial meningiomas,
and spinal tumors such as schwannomas, meningiomas
and ependymomas [1, 2]. Although most meningiomas
are benign (WHO grade I), they often cause severe
neurologic morbidity and mortality due to compression

of the adjacent brain or spinal cord. Benign meningiomas
have recurrence rates of up to 20% over 10 years. Twenty
percent of meningiomas are classified as atypical (WHO
grade II) or anaplastic (WHO grade III), and display
more aggressive clinical behavior with faster growth and
increased recurrence rates [3, 4]. The current standard of
care for NF2-related meningiomas is maximal surgical
resection with adjuvant radiation reserved for inoperable
or progressive tumors, or those with aggressive features
(e.g., WHO grades II or III). Meningiomas that progress
despite surgery and radiation cause high morbidity, and the
overall NF2 patient survival rate is ~38% at 20 years from
diagnosis [5]. Therefore, effective non-invasive therapies
are much needed for NF2-associated meningiomas
and vestibular schwannomas, as well as their sporadic
counterparts commonly seen in the general population.
The NF2 tumor suppressor protein merlin (NCBI
definition, Neurofibromin 2/NF2) has been implicated
in a wide range of mitogenic signaling pathways [6] in
various cell types. However, the mechanism by which
merlin/NF2 loss in human arachnoidal and Schwann cells
results in meningiomas and schwannomas remains poorly
understood. Employing patient-derived NF2-deficient
meningioma cells and NF2 knockdown (shRNA) human
arachnoidal cells, the cell of origin for meningiomas,
we established that mammalian/mechanistic target of
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is negatively regulated
by merlin/NF2. mTORC1 is constitutively activated in
NF2-associated schwannomas and meningiomas, and
rapamycin was shown to block this mTORC1 activation
[7, 8]. Subsequent studies carried out in mouse models
reported that rapamycin suppressed the growth of
meningiomas in a xenograft model [9] and delayed the
growth of NF2-related Schwann cell tumorigenesis [10].
These studies led to clinical trials with mTORC1 inhibitor
everolimus (RAD001), a rapamycin analog, for NF2 and
sporadic meningiomas. Initial results from these clinical
trials have been mixed, with one study reporting no
shrinkage of vestibular schwannomas during everolimus
treatment [11], and other studies reporting a delay in
vestibular schwannoma growth during treatment [10, 12].
mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved serine/
threonine kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation
and survival through two distinct functional complexes,
mTORC1 and mTORC2, which signal to specific
downstream targets [13, 14]. To further understand the
role of merlin/NF2 in mTORC1 activation, we undertook
an unbiased kinome screen in NF2-null meningioma
cells. Here we report distinct activation of the mTORC2
target SGK1, detected by phosphorylation of its substrate
NDRG1 (N-myc downstream-regulated 1) in NF2-null
human meningioma cells and NF2-deficient human
arachnoidal cells, which remains insensitive to the
mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin. We further show
that the selective mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD2014,
targeting both mTORC1 and mTORC2, is more efficient
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

than rapamycin in blocking proliferation of primary
human meningioma cells and thus may hold promise as a
more effective therapeutic option for NF2 patients.

RESULTS
High-throughput shRNA kinome screen reveals
candidate kinases for constitutive mTORC1
activation in NF2-deficient cells
We previously reported constitutive activation of
mTORC1 signaling in NF2-deficient human arachnoidal
cells (ACs), in primary meningioma cells and in NF2associated tumors, meningiomas and schwannomas. We
placed NF2 upstream of the tuberous sclerosis complex
proteins TSC1-TSC2, which inhibits mTORC1 through
TSC2 GAP activity toward the small GTPase Rheb. Our
results showed that NF2 negatively regulates mTORC1
independent of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways [7].
To further understand mTORC1 activation upon NF2
loss, we raised the question whether Rheb is required for
this activation, and observed that suppression of Rheb
rescues the constitutive activation of mTORC1 signaling
by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analyses
(Figure 1), which confirmed that NF2 loss results in
mTORC1 activation in a Rheb-dependent manner. Next
we undertook an immunofluorescence-based, highthroughput kinome screen to identify kinases which,
when suppressed, leads to decreased pathway activation
using phosphorylated ribosomal S6 protein S240/244
(pS6) as a readout (assessed by decreased pS6 staining
intensity). The primary screen was carried out in triplicate
in the NF2-negative benign meningioma cell line BenMen-1 [15], using a high-titer lentiviral kinome shRNA
library developed by The RNAi Consortium (TRC;
Broad Institute/MIT, Cambridge, MA). Top hit calling
was performed using robust z scoring methodology that
is frequently employed in high-throughput RNAi screens
to identify positives [16]. A list of top hit candidates
emerged using the following criteria: 1) an infection
efficiency > 60%, 2) two or more independent hairpins
for an individual kinase displaying a robust z score <
-1.8 (representing a reduction in pS6 staining intensity
by >50% in our screen) observed in 3 replicates, and 3)
no significant decrease in nuclei number to ensure that
decreased pS6 was not due to decreased cell number.
A secondary screen of independently packaged and
assembled shRNA lentivirus (5 hairpins/candidate)
for top hits in Ben-Men-1 cells confirmed the primary
screen candidates. As predicted, mTOR emerged as a
significant kinase with an average robust z score of -2.30
for 3 independent shRNA clones, thus showing proofof-concept for the screen. Interestingly, two top kinases
to emerge were serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1

respectively (Figure 2, Table 1).
SGK1 is one of three primary downstream AGC
kinase targets of mTORC2, which also include Akt and
PKC [17-19]. Previously Huang et al. demonstrated that
Tsc2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with
constitutive activation of mTORC1 revealed inhibition of
mTORC2 activity with attenuated phosphorylation of all
three targets Akt, PKC-α and SGK1, using the effector
pNDRG1 as a biomarker for SGK1 activation [20]. In
contrast, we recently demonstrated that in NF2-shRNA
suppressed human ACs and Schwann cells (SCs), while
like Tsc2-/- MEFS show attenuated pAkt and pPKC-α,
the mTORC2 target SGK1/pNDRG1 displays robust
constitutive activation [21]. Regarding PAK1, NF2
protein is known to negatively regulate Rac1 signaling
via inhibition of PAK1, and it has been demonstrated
that loss of Nf2 expression leads to activation of Pak1 in
rat Schwann cells [22, 23]. In addition, PAK1 activity is
upregulated in NF2 patient-derived schwannomas [24].
Moreover, chemical compounds targeting PAK1 have
been suggested as a potential therapeutic for NF2 [25,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

26]. Given our recent observation of mTORC2-SGK1/
pNDRG1 activation in NF2-deficient cells [21], as well
as reports associating NF2 with Rac1/PAK1 signaling, we
chose to follow up and expand our studies of these two
candidate kinases.

NF2-deficient cells show activation of SGK1/
pNDRG1, and SGK1 inhibition rescues
constitutive mTORC1/pS6 activation
Of the two independent SGK1-shRNA clones that
rescued pS6 activation in our screen, we performed largescale packaging of 1 clone to carry out further studies.
Inhibition of SGK1 was performed using lentiviral
SGK1-shRNA infection in Ben-Men-1 cells, or with the
SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394 in both Ben-Men-1 cells and
NF2-shRNA ACs. Both of these showed attenuation of
mTORC1 signaling (pS6 readout) and downregulation of
pNDRG1, a specific readout for SGK1 activation (Figure
3A and 3B). Importantly, while many recent studies
demonstrate SGK1 as a downstream target of mTORC2
signaling, SGK1 has also been reported downstream of
mTORC1 in some cell types [27]. We tested whether

the observed constitutive SGK1/pNDRG1 activation
was blocked by either mTORC1 inhibition alone or dual
inhibition of mTORC1/mTORC2 signaling. We treated
NF2-shRNA ACs and Ben-Men-1 cells with the allosteric
mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, or an ATP-competitive
dual mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitor, Torin1. In both cellular
models, we observed downregulation of SGK1/pNDRG1
with Torin1 treatment; however, pNDRG1 was not rescued
in NF2-suppressed ACs using rapamycin (Figure 3C
compared to 3D). This suggests that SGK1 activation is
dependent on mTORC2 and independent of mTORC1.

4C). We also carried out shRNA suppression of RAC1
which also attenuated mTORC1/pS6; however, PAK1shRNA, RAC1-shRNA and FRAX597 inhibitor treatment
were unable to rescue constitutive activation of SGK1/
pNDRG1, suggesting PAK1 and RAC1 are not required
for activation of SGK1/pNDRG1, and may play a distinct
role for constitutive mTORC1 activation in these cells
(Figure 4A and 4C).

mTORC1 and mTORC2/SGK1 signaling

NF2-shRNA knockdown ACs show significant
reduction, but not total absence of NF2; therefore, we
employed CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing using a single
guide RNA targeting the human NF2 exon 8 [28] in
AC007-hTERT. Genotyping of selected single clones
revealed 6 clones retaining wildtype (WT) sequence for
NF2 exon 8, 3 clones with homozygous NF2 exon 8 in/
del mutations, and 3 clones with compound heterozygous
NF2 exon 8 in/dels with distinct mutations on each allele,
where all in/del mutations predicted putative premature
stop codons. We chose independent clones of NF2expressing ACs (clones A2(+) and A3(+), WT) and NF2null CRISPR ACs (clones A4(-) and A17(-), compound
het; and A19(-), homozygous) (Table 2) and tested the

In our high-throughput screen we identified two
independent shRNA clones targeting PAK1 that rescued
the constitutive mTORC1 activation in Ben-Men-1 cells
(Table 1), and we performed large-scale packaging of
1 clone to carry out further studies. Inhibition of PAK1
using lentiviral PAK1-shRNA infection or treatment using
the group I PAK inhibitor FRAX597 in Ben-Men-1 cells
showed attenuation of pS6 (Figure 4A and 4B). FRAX597
treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of pS6
and downregulation of pPAK1 S144 (Figure 4B and

CRISPR cells, confirming our previous reports [7, 21]
that Akt activation is not responsible for constitutive
mTORC1 activation in NF2 target cell types. These
data indicate that mTORC1 activation in NF2-null ACCRISPR cells, at least in part, is dependent on a novel
mechanism involving distinct activation of mTORC2SGK1 signaling that is independent of mTORC2-Akt
signaling. Further, we examined whether rapamycin
was capable of activating mTORC2-SGK1 in our
cellular model, which is a known concern of rapamycin
treatment through relieving feedback mechanisms toward
mTORC2-Akt signaling [18]. Treatment with rapamycin
for 2h and 24h inhibited mTORC1 signaling as measured

by decreased pS6, however, mTORC2-SGK1 signaling,
detected by pNDRG1, concomitantly increased in both the
NF2-expressing and NF2-null AC-CRISPR cells grown
under full serum conditions (Figure 5D) confirming that
mTORC2-SGK1 signaling is activated by rapamycin.
Taken together, these results suggest that dual inhibition
of mTORC1 and mTORC2 could be more effective in
NF2-deficient cells.

meningioma (MN) cell lines, as well as 3 NF2-null
AC-CRISPR clones revealed increased SGK1 levels
compared to control ACs (Figure 6A and 6B). Next we
tested SGK1 expression at the transcriptional level using
2 independent primer sets targeting human SGK1 in
isogenic NF2-CRISPR ACs. As expected, quantitative
RT-PCR analysis of the NF2-expressing A2(+) clone
showed decreased SGK1 expression under serum-deprived
conditions compared to full-serum conditions (Figure 6C).
The NF2-expressing A3(+) clone also showed identical
results (data not shown). Interestingly, under serumdeprived conditions, NF2-null AC-CRISPR clones A4(-)
and A17(-) revealed 2.5 - 4 fold increased expression in
SGK1 compared to A2(+) (Figure 6C). Taken together, our
results demonstrate that NF2 loss in ACs leads to elevated
SGK1 expression at the transcriptional level, which may
partly explain the elevated SGK1/pNDRG1 signaling in
these cells.

both mTORC1-dependent and mTORC2-dependent
substrate phosphorylation at 100 nM. As expected, 20
nM rapamycin inhibited mTORC1-dependent S6K
phosphorylation, however, failed to inhibit mTORC2dependent phosphorylation of NDRG1 even at 10fold higher doses (1000 nM) than AZD2014. These
data suggest that AZD2014 is superior to rapamycin in

NF2 protein merlin as a negative regulator of RAC1-PAK1 signaling as well as a distinct mTORC2-SGK1 signaling axis independent of
mTORC2-Akt. Upon loss of NF2, constitutive activation of mTORC2-SGK1 and/or RAC1-PAK1 pathways in turn may lead to aberrant
mTORC1 activation. Treatment with rapamycin analogs such as RAD001 (mTORC1-specific) or group I PAK inhibitors (FRAX597)
specifically inhibits mTORC1 signaling, whereas treatment with SGK1 inhibitor (GSK650394) or ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor
(AZD2014) downregulates both mTORC2-SGK1 and mTORC1 signaling pathways. Chemical inhibitors are shaded. Dashed lines,

inhibiting mTOR signaling in NF2-deficient MN cells in
vitro. To test whether growth of NF2-associated MNs may
be dependent on increased mTORC1/mTORC2 signaling,
we performed cell viability assays of seven independent
NF2-deficient primary MN cells in the presence of either
rapamycin or AZD2014. Data from three independent
cell lines are shown. Cell viability/proliferation of NF2deficient MNs was effectively inhibited by AZD2014
with IC50 values < 100 nM after 72 hours of treatment
(Figure 7B, right). In contrast, rapamycin treatment was
not as effective as AZD2014 at suppressing NF2-deficient
meningioma cell proliferation. Although partial growth
inhibition was observed with low doses of rapamycin
(1 nM, Figure 7B, left) no further inhibition of cell
viability/proliferation was observed with increasing the
concentrations of rapamycin. These data indicate that
AZD2014 has a much greater effect at inhibiting cell
proliferation of NF2-deficient MN cells than rapamycin.
Cell viability assays were also carried out with the group I
PAK inhibitor FRAX597, which was effective in blocking
the viability/proliferation of NF2-deficient human MN
cells, but at higher concentrations (IC50 > 4 µM) that may
not be suitable for treatment (Figure 7C).

Akt and SGK1 are AGC kinases downstream of
mTORC2 that share approximately 50% identity [35].
Akt is generally considered as the critical effector of PI3K
signaling, and most work in the cancer field is focused on
Akt being the important mediator of cell proliferation upon
PI3K activation. However, similar to Akt, SGK family
members 1) are activated upon dual phosphorylation
by PDK1 and mTORC2 in the PI3K pathway, 2) reveal
overlapping substrate specificity with Akt, and 3) are
implicated as potential players in malignant transformation
[36-38]. In addition to Akt, phosphorylation of the SGK1specific substrate NDRG1 is considered a reliable marker
for mTORC2 activation [17, 39]. Interestingly, in NF2null AC-CRISPR cells, upon deprivation of serum/growth
factors, SGK1 is activated while Akt is not activated.
Further, Akt inhibitor has no effect on either pS6 or
pNDRG1 (Figure 5C). Taken together, it is likely that a
distinct mTORC2-SGK1 signaling axis, independent of
mTORC2-Akt, could be a major driver of proliferation
in NF2-null AC and MN cells (Figure 8, model). A
recent study documents increased SGK1 expression in
a subset of breast cancer cell lines that are resistant to
Akt inhibition, and treatment of these cells with an ATPcompetitive mTOR kinase inhibitor leads to inhibition of
SGK1 activation and suppression of proliferation, thus
highlighting the role of SGK1 activation in breast cancer
[38]. Further, in glioblastomas with activating mutation in
EGFR, NF-κB is activated through mTORC2 in an SGK1dependent manner that does not require Akt or mTORC1,
underlying the Akt-independence of this pathway [40].
Taken together, it is important to examine the activation
of SGK1/NDRG1 in addition to Akt when evaluating
mTORC2 activation.
While much information is known about the
regulation of mTORC1, the mechanism by which
mTORC2 is regulated is poorly understood. We have
observed constitutive activation of mTORC2-SGK1 in
NF2-null ACs upon serum/growth factor deprivation, and
further studies are necessary to understand the mechanism
of this activation. One possibility is the elevated level
of several growth factor receptors, including ERBB3,
observed upon NF2 loss at the plasma membrane [41,
42] that may feed into and activate the mTOR pathway. It
is also possible that GRK7, EPHA5, and/or ERBB3 that
we have identified in the kinome screen (Table 1) may
play a role upstream of mTORC1/mTORC2, and further
studies are essential on these and the other validated hits
from the screen. Our work also raises the question of how
mTORC2 distinctly activates SGK1 independent of Akt
under growth factor-deprived conditions in NF2-null cells.
A physical association between the mTORC2-specific
component, mSIN1 (mammalian stress-activated protein
kinase-interacting protein 1) and SGK1 is shown to be
important for the mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation
of SGK1 and its activation, which appears to be distinct
from Akt, since Akt does not bind to mSIN1, raising the

DISCUSSION
mTOR kinase forms two distinct functional
complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which signal to
distinct downstream targets. mTORC1 phosphorylates
p70S6K and 4EBP1 and is inhibited by rapamycin and its
analogs such as RAD001 through an allosteric mechanism.
mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt, PKC-α and SGK1 and
is inhibited by mTOR kinase inhibitors that are ATPcompetitive, but not by Rapalogs [14, 32]. Others and
we have previously reported activation of mTORC1 in
NF2-deficient human cells, leading to clinical trials with
a rapamycin analog [7, 33]. Employing a high-throughput
shRNA kinome screening, here we have identified
candidate kinases that may contribute to the observed
mTORC1 activation in NF2-deficient meningioma cells.
In particular, we demonstrate that independent activation
of SGK1 and PAK1 may be partly responsible for the
mTORC1 activation in NF2-deficient meningioma cells
(Figure 8, model). We further show elevated expression of
SGK1 accompanied by constitutive activation of SGK1 as
detected by phosphorylation of its specific target NDRG1,
in human arachnoidal and meningioma cells with NF2
loss. Our results convincingly show that activation of the
mTORC2-target SGK1/NDRG1 in human meningioma
cells is sensitive to AZD2014, but insensitive to
rapamycin. Treatment of primary meningioma cells with
the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor, AZD2014, leads
to more profound suppression of cell proliferation when
compared with rapamycin. Further studies are necessary
to understand whether cell death mechanisms [34] are
induced upon treatment with AZD2014.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

possibility that mTORC2 could selectively associate
with its substrates and regulate specific cellular process
[43]. Based on the increased expression of SGK1 that we
observe upon NF2 loss, it is tempting to speculate whether
enhanced binding between SGK1 and mSIN1 occurs in
NF2-deficient cells, which could be responsible for the
selective activation of SGK1. Taken together it is possible
that upstream signaling that activates an mTORC2-SGK1
axis may be context-specific and not necessarily shared
with an mTORC2-Akt axis.
To date, there are no medical therapies that have
proven efficacious for meningiomas, either sporadic or
NF2-related. Moreover, there are no relevant genetic
mouse models for drug testing in meningiomas, especially
for recurrent or progressive tumors. Nf2 mutant mice
(Nf2+/-) do not develop schwannomas or meningiomas, and
selective Cre-mediated excision of Nf2 in arachnoidal cells
results in development of benign (grade I) meningioma
in mice [44]. However, only 30% of these mice develop
intracranial meningiomas, which are microscopic and
require a prolonged time to appear, thus limiting the use of
this in vivo model for therapeutic studies. Our earlier work
in human meningioma cells demonstrating the activation
of mTORC1 led to clinical trials with rapamycin analogs
for NF2 and sporadic meningioma patients. Rapamycin is
merely cytostatic in our cells, consistent with the clinical
outcome thus far observed with RAD001/everolimus.
Moreover, rapamycin treatment is known to relieve the
negative feedback inhibition on IRS-1 [45, 46], Grb10
[47, 48] as well as other negative regulation of mTORC2
independent of IRS-1 and Grb10 [49, 50], and thus can
activate PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK prosurvival pathways.
Similarly, here we have shown that rapamycin treatment
can also upregulate mTORC2-SGK1 signaling (Figure
5D). As an AGC kinase family member closely related to
Akt, SGK1 can also phosphorylate Akt substrates such as
FOXO3a and BAD and lead to potential survival signals
[36, 37]. Here we establish that, in addition to mTORC1
activation, mTORC2-dependent activation of SGK1/
NDRG1 is commonly seen in human meningioma cells,
which remains unaffected by rapamycin treatment. Our
studies indicate that the selective mTOR kinase inhibitor
AZD2014, which targets both mTORC1 and mTORC2,
is more efficient than mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin in
blocking proliferation of primary human meningioma
cells. Importantly, AZD2014 is currently in use in
AstraZeneca-sponsored clinical trials as well as other
ongoing Externally Sponsored Research (ESR) studies
for patients with many types of cancer [51]. Therefore,
we believe that there is a timely opportunity for testing
the ATP-competitive dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor
AZD2014, which may offer critical therapeutic advantage
over rapalogs for recurrent or progressive meningiomas

Cell lines and reagents
Cell lines included immortalized NF2-deficient
meningioma Ben-Men-1 [15], immortalized arachnoid
AC007-hTERT derived from an NF2 patient expressing
heterozygous level of NF2 [7, 8], primary normal
arachnoid AC028, and several primary NF2-deficient
meningioma (MN) lines. Ben-Men-1 cells and AC007hTERT were maintained under growth conditions
described [7, 15], and all primary lines were established
and maintained as reported [8]. Low passage 293T
cells for large-scale lentiviral packaging were obtained
from TRC. Insulin was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Inhibitor reagents included rapamycin and AktVIII
(EMD Millipore; Billerica, MA), AZD2014 (provided
by AstraZeneca; Wilmington, DE), GSK650394 (Tocris;
Minneapolis, MN), Torin1 (kindly provided by Dr. David
Sabatini, Whitehead Institute/MIT, Cambridge, MA)
and FRAX597 (generously given by Dr. Joseph Kissil,
The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL). Inhibitor
treatment times and concentrations are described in figure
legends. All inhibitors were diluted as per manufacturer’s
recommendations.

High-throughput shRNA screen
The immunofluorescence-based kinome screen was
carried out using Ben-Men-1 in a 384-well plate format.
The entire kinome library, developed by TRC, consisted
of high titer lentivirus for 6,091 shRNAs, cloned into the
pLKO-puromycin system, targeting 747 distinct kinases
that were arrayed on 18 384-well plates (5-10 shRNAs/
kinase). Each library virus plate contained internal
negative controls including shRNAs targeting irrelevant
reporter genes (GFP, RFP, luciferase and LacZ), a nonhairpin forming (nullT) control and media alone (no virus).
Each screening plate included a positive control lentiviral
human RHEB-shRNA (TRCN0000010424). In addition,
a separate library control plate was used consisting of 95
distinct negative control hairpins. Infections included 4
biological replicates, 3 under puromycin (puro) selection
(0.75µg/ml, Life Technologies; Grand Island, NY) and 1
without puro. All subsequent steps (addition of lentivirus
to fixation) were carried out by TRC using robotic liquid
handling. At 18-20h after plating, each shRNA lentivirus
was transferred onto cells in the presence of 5µg/ml
polybrene (Sigma). The cells were spun at 2250rpm at
370C for 30min, and transferred to 370C overnight. The
following day, virus was removed and fresh growth media
was added (with or without puro). After 72h, cells were
incubated in serum free media for 18-20h and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences;

followed by co-incubation with AlexaFlour488
conjugated-pS6 (Ser240/244) antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology; Beverly, MA) and DAPI (Life Technologies)
for 18-20h at +4oC. Analysis for pS6 staining intensity
was performed using the Acumen eX3 laser-scanning
fluorescence microplate cytometer. Immunofluorescent
staining in Figure 1 was visualized on a Nikon (Tokyo,
Japan) Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope using the
EXFO X-Cite 120 fluorescent illumination system. Images
were acquired with a Nikon DS-QiMc camera and NISElements BR imaging software.

the AC007-hTERT cell line (AC cells). AC cells
were transfected using the basic primary fibroblasts
Nucleofector kit and the AmaxaNucleofector II (Lonza;
Walkersville, MD) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, AC cells were resuspended in
Nucleofector solution, and then transfected using
program U-023 with lenti-CRISPR-NF2_sg1 expressing
a single guide RNA targeting human NF2 exon 8, the
Cas9 enzyme, and a puro selection cassette (a kind gift
from the Zhang laboratory at the Broad Institute and
MIT [28]. Following transfection, cells were re-plated
sparsely to form single colonies. Single AC-CRISPR
cell clones were picked and expanded for genomic DNA
extraction, PCR of human NF2 exon 8, and Sanger
sequencing to confirm in/del mutations. PCR primers:
hNF2 ex 8-F, 5’-gggacccagaagtcacaaga-3’; hNF2 ex 8-R,
5’-tttcattatgcatgcccaga-3’.

Large-scale lentiviral packaging and infection
For large-scale packaging, pLKO-puro-based
shRNAs targeting human SGK1 (TRCN0000194957),
human PAK1 (TRCN0000197238), human RHEB
(TRCN0000010424) as well as pLKO.1-emptyT (nullT)
control (TRCN0000208001) were obtained from TRC, and
packaged using TRC methods (http://www.broadinstitute.
org/rnai/public/resources/protocols). For viral infection,
Ben-Men-1 cells were transduced using lentiviral shRNAs
for each of the following hairpins: SGK1, PAK1, RHEB,
nullT control, as well as no virus control. Spin-infection
was carried out at 2000rpm for 1.5h at 37oC, and then
cells were transferred to 37oC overnight. The following
day, cells were passaged to a 15cm plate, followed by puro
selection (0.5µg/ml) for 3 days with no live cells observed
in the control without virus. Media was exchanged for
fresh growth media without puro prior to all further
experiments.

RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and quantitative
PCR
AC-CRISPR cells were lysed in TRIzol Reagent
(Life Technologies), rinsed in chloroform, and aqueous
layer was applied to Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen; Santa
Clarita, CA) columns followed by RNA purification
according to manufacturer’s instructions. For cDNA
synthesis, the Superscript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Life
Technologies) was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and quantitative RT-PCR (q-RT-PCR) was
carried out in triplicate on a Roche (Indianapolis, IN)
Lightcycler 480 (software version 1.5.0 SP3) using iQSYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA). For
human SGK1, two independent primer sets were used
including primer set #1 (254bp amplicon): hSGK1 qPCR1F, 5’-atgacggtgaaaactgaggct-3’; hSGK1 qPCR-1R,
5’-gttctccttgcagagtccgaag-3’, which were validated by
TRC/Broad Institute (primer sequences from PrimerBank,
http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/index.html)
and primer set #2 (132bp amplicon): hSGK1 qPCR2F, 5’-GCTGAAATAGCCAGTGCCTTGG-3’; hSGK1
qPCR-2R, 5’-GTTCTCCTTGCAGAGTCCGAAG-3’.
Human 18S served as a control using primers: h18S-F,
5’-ACCCGTTGAACCCCATTCGTGA-3’;
h18S-R,
5’-GCCTCACTAAACCATCCAATCGG-3’. Melt curves
showed single peak specificity for each q-RT-PCR primer
set.

Immunoblotting and antibodies
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out
as described [7]. Antibodies for phospho-S6 (S240/244),
S6, phospho-p70 S6K (T389), p70 S6K, phospho-Akt
(S473), Akt, phospho-NDRG1 (T346), SGK1, phosphoPAK1 (S144), Pak1, and 4EBP1 were from Cell Signaling
Technology. Other antibodies included NDRG1 (Abcam;
Cambridge, MA), Rac1 (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA),
GAPDH (EMD Millipore), Rheb (3M6 monoclonal;
a generous gift from Richard Lamb, University of
Liverpool, U.K.) and the NF2 polyclonal C26 antibody
has been described [52].
