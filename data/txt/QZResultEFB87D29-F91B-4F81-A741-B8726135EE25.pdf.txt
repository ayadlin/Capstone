Abstract
Most cancer patients receive radiotherapy during the course of their disease. Improvements in the therapeutic index have been based mainly on physical improvements in delivery, as radiosensitizer development to
target tumor cells has yet to yield effective agents. Recent investigations have focused on the tumor stroma as
a target for radiosensitization. Here, we report that depletion of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMφ) by
systemic or local injection of the macrophage-depleting liposomal clodronate before radiotherapy can increase
the antitumor effects of ionizing radiation (IR), either as a large single dose (20 Gy) or as a fractionated dose
(2 Gy × 10). Coimplantation of tumor cells with bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMφ) increased
tumor radioresistance. Studies using mice with germline deletions in tumor necrosis factor receptors 1
and 2 (TNFR1,2−/−) or TNFα (TNF−/−), or treatment of wild-type mice with a soluble TNF receptor fusion
protein (Enbrel), revealed that radioresistance mediated by BMDMφ required intact TNFα signaling. Radiation exposure upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in macrophages and VEGF-neutralizing
antibodies enhanced the antitumor response to IR. Thus, the radioprotective effect of TNFα was mediated by
TAM-produced VEGF. Our findings offer a mechanistic basis to target macrophage populations generally or
TNFα-induced macrophage VEGF specifically as tractable strategies to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy.

Introduction
Radiation therapy is a common cancer treatment usually
delivered in a fractionated schedule (daily 1.8–3 Gy) for 6 to
8 weeks. In some selected lung cancers, or limited forms of
metastasis, very large doses (one to five treatments of 10–20
Gy) may be used (1). Despite research into the radiobiology
and physics of radiotherapy, many patients fail within the irradiated target volume. Currently, the most effective radiosensitizers represent the commonly used chemotherapeutic
agents (2). These drugs are not designed as selective radiosensitizers, and clinical improvement reflected by increased
local control is achieved at the expense of significant normal
tissue toxicity. More selective radiosensitizing agents and

new treatment strategies are required to improve the therapeutic index in radiotherapy.
Research on the mechanisms of tumor radioresistance and
the development of radiosensitizers focuses on tumor cells or
exploiting differences in the oxygenation status of tumors
and normal tissue (3). Recently, the tumor-associated stroma
has gained attention as an important component of the response to radiotherapy (4, 5) and investigations have centered on the role of the tumor-associated vasculature (6, 7).
Several clinical trials are under way to investigate the role of
angiogenesis inhibitors in combination with radiotherapy
(8–11). The results are preliminary and, although promising,
show mixed results in terms of improving radiotherapy outcomes and unexpected toxicities have been reported (11–13).
Conversely, little is known about other components of the
tumor-associated stroma and the effect of these cells on
the response of tumors to radiotherapy.
Macrophages are multifunctional cells of the myeloid lineage, phenotyped as CD14+. Macrophages engulf microbes and
cell debris, are antigen-presenting cells, and secrete cytokines
and chemokines. Macrophage function is described within the
context of normal physiologic or pathologic microenvironments. Macrophages are designated as M1 classically activated macrophages or M2 alternatively activated macrophages.
Proinflammatory M1 macrophages are activated by lipopolysaccharide and IFNγ, secrete tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α
and interleukin (IL)-12, and support T-cell function. M2
macrophages are considered to be anti-inflammatory and

Targeting TNFα in TAMφ for Radiosensitization

immunosuppressive, expressing F4/80, CD11b, and CD206; secrete IL-10, IL-4, and transforming growth factor-β; and downregulate T-cell function (14, 15). Tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMφ) are usually characterized as M2. However, functional overlap exists between characteristics of M1
and M2 macrophages. Additional/expanded definitions of
TAMφ populations have been investigated as determinants
of tumor progression and metastasis. These populations
include CD11b +/Gr1+ myeloid suppressor cells as well as
Tie2+-expressing macrophages (15, 16). Emerging data suggest
key roles for these various monocyte/macrophage cells in
generating proangiogenic signals during tumor growth.
Radiation was originally reported to prime the antitumor
effects of macrophages through production of TNFα and nitric oxide (NO; refs. 17–20). However, Milas and colleagues
investigated the association between TAMφ and the response of tumors to radiotherapy and noted a trend toward
decreasing radiocurability with increasing TAMφ content.
These investigators recognized the contradiction between
potential beneficial (phagocytic function) and deleterious
functions (proangiogenic phenotypes) of TAMφ (21–23).
Recently, Tsai and colleagues (24) reported that irradiated
macrophages contributed to tumor growth through increased secretion of cyclooxygenase-2, inducible NO synthase
(iNOS), and Arg-1, although no direct mechanisms for promotion of tumor growth were described. Ahn and Brown
(25) reported that cells of the myeloid/macrophage lineage
contributed to tumor regrowth following radiation by increasing tumor vasculogenesis when tumor angiogenesis
was suppressed by prior irradiation of the tumor bed. Collectively, these studies raise the possibility that macrophage
populations contribute to tumor radioprotection. Moreover,
radiation of the tumor microenvironment might upregulate
macrophage-derived cytokines that promote tumor growth,
survival, angiogenesis, and vasculogenesis.
TNFα, which has antitumor effects at high concentrations,
also promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell survival, and
metastases at lower levels (26). A recent report suggested
that TNFα mediates the differentiation of monocytes into
angiogenic cells that support tumor angiogenesis (27–29).
Radiotherapy, although directly inducing tumor cell death,
may upregulate proangiogenic and prosurvival factors within
the tumor microenvironment. We and others have found
that radiation upregulates TNFα production by tumor cells
and cells of the myeloid lineage (30, 31). Here, we report that
depletion of macrophages by liposomal clodronate before
irradiation increases the antitumor effects of ionizing
radiation (IR), whereas coimplantation of tumor cells
with bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMφ) results
in increased tumor radioresistance. The radioprotective effect of BMDMφ requires functional TNFα/TNFR signaling
and induction of macrophage-secreted vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF). We report that blockade of macrophage VEGF induction by Enbrel (soluble TNF receptor
dimeric fusion protein), used in several murine studies, increased tumor radiosensitivity (32, 33). We also report that
blocking VEGF with neutralizing antibodies improves the
antitumor effects of IR. These data provide a rationale for

targeting macrophage populations generally and TNFαinduced VEGF signaling specifically when designing radiotherapeutic strategies.

Materials and Methods
Mice and tumor cell lines. C57BL/6 mice wild-type (WT),
C57BL/6-129S-Tnfrsf1atm1ImxTnfrsf1btm1Imx/J (TNFR1,2−/−),
B6:-129S-Tnf tm1Gkl/J (TNF−/−), and C57BL/6-Tg (UBC-GFP)
30SchaJ (GFP+/+) breeding pairs were purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory. TNF−/− mice maintained in the 129/SvEv
and C57BL/6 backgrounds after six-generation backcross
have been previously used to study the effects of TNFα on
tumor promotion and antigen presentation (29, 34). B16F1
melanoma cells were cultured as described (35) B16.SIY melanoma cells expressing model antigen SIY, which can be recognized by CD8+ T cells in the context of Kb, were cultured as
described. The care and treatment of experimental animals
was in accordance with institutional guidelines.
Generation of BMDMφ. Femoral BM cells were obtained
from mice and cultured in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 30% pretested conditioned medium
from the L929 cell line as a source of macrophage colonystimulating factor (M-CSF) for the first 5 d followed by complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 10 ng/mL
recombinant M-CSF (R&D Systems) for additional 5 d.
These BMDMφ were >95% CD14+ and >90% CD11b+F4/80+,
analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
Tumor induction and irradiation. Tumor cells (5 × 105
B16F1 or B16.SIY) were inoculated s.c. into the right hind
limb. Tumors were measured with calipers and volume was
calculated as length × width × depth/2. At days 10 to 12, local
radiotherapy (single dose, 20 Gy; fractional doses, 2 Gy × 10)
was delivered. In some experiments, B16F1/B16.SIY cells
were coinjected with BMDMφ at a 4:1 ratio. Elsewhere,
macrophages were depleted by i.p. or intratumoral administration of liposomal clodronate every 5 to 7 d (36). Cl2MDP
(or clodronate) was a gift of Roche Diagnostics GmbH (37).
Other reagents include phosphatidylcholine (Lipoid GmbH)
and cholesterol (Sigma). Macrophage depletion was confirmed by FACS and immunohistochemistry of spleen and tumor cryosections with >90% reduction compared with the
control. Blockade of VEGF using neutralizing IgG against
mouse VEGF-164 (R&D Systems) has been previously described (38). Briefly, goat IgG against mouse VEGF-164
was suspended in PBS and administered via i.p. injection
(10 μg/mouse, 3 h before IR and 3 and 8 d after IR). Control
mice received goat IgG (Sigma).
Colony-forming assay. Two hundred control or irradiated
B16F1 or B16.SIY cells were seeded in 5-cm culture dishes in
RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS with or without 30% spent
supernatant collected from either WT, TNF−/−, or TNFR1,2
−/−
BMDMφ (5 × 106 cells). After 7 d, cells were washed
and stained with crystal violet. Colonies with >50 cells were
counted.
Protein array and Luminex. Spent culture supernatants
were collected and incubated with membranes coated
with 62 anti-mouse cytokine antibodies (RayBiotech, Inc.)

according to the manufacturer's instruction. An antibody labeled with biotin coated on the upper left and lower right corners of the membrane served as positive control. The film was
scanned and spots were quantified by densitometry analysis
using UN-SCAN-IT gel automated digitizing system software
(Silk Scientific). Thirty-two cytokines were quantified using
Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Premixed 32 Plex (Millipore).
Median fluorescence intensity from each well was acquired,
and the relative concentration of each cytokine/chemokine
was calculated.
FACS and cell sorting. Tumors were excised, sectioned,
and digested in DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS and 1.5
mg/mL collagenase D (Sigma) for 30 min in a 37°C shaking
incubator to collect single-cell suspension. Cells were stained
with anti-CD11b, anti-CD206, anti-F4/80, anti-TNFR1, and
anti-TNFR2 (BioLegend); washed; and analyzed on a LSR
flow cytometer. Frequency of CD11b+ and F4/80+ TAMφ
was analyzed and sorted on a MoFlow to collect TAMφ.
Purity reached >95% CD11b+ F4/80+ cells.
Western blot. Cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L Na2EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mmol/L
sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, and protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and 10 μg from
each sample were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Protein
bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with rabbit anti-mouse VEGF (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h and then horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit for 1 h. Membranes were
washed and immunodetected using ECL kit (Amersham
Biosciences). Anti–β-actin-stained membranes were used
as loading control.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Tissues
were fixed in 10% neutral formalin or 4% paraformaldehyde.

Sections were blocked with 5% goat serum and incubated with
VEGFR2 antibody (1:200 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology)
for 1 h. After washing with TBS, biotinylated anti-rabbit
secondary antibody followed by avidin-biotin complex–
alkaline phosphatase (ABC-AP; Vector Laboratories) was
applied for 30 min each. Vector blue substrate was used for
color development. For the following NG2 chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycan staining, the slides were washed and blocked
with avidin-biotin blocking kit and then 10% goat serum for
10 min. Slides were incubated in 1:100 dilution of NG2 antibody (Millipore) overnight at 4°C. After applying biotinylated
secondary antibody and ABC-AP solution, tissues were covered with Vulcan fast red substrate (Biocare Medical) for
15 min. Slides were washed and counterstained with methyl
green. Sections were dehydrated in 100% ethanol, cleared by
Histoclear (Wards Natural Science), and then mounted with
VectaMount (Vector Laboratories). Images were photographed at ×200 magnification using a Zeiss camera operated
by Openlab software.
Statistical analysis. A random-effects model for longitudinal data was used to obtain an overall estimate of the intercept and slope of linear growth for each group. One-way
ANOVA with Dunnett's post test was performed using
GraphPad InStat version 3.05 (P < 0.05).

Results
Depletion of macrophages increases the antitumor
effects of IR. Macrophages were depleted by i.p. injection
of liposomal clodronate (37) 1 day before injection of 2 ×
106 B16.SIY cells and every 5 days thereafter in WT mice.
Ninety percent of the macrophages were specifically depleted
in the spleen and tumor microenvironment as analyzed by
FACS (Supplementary Fig. S1; refs. 36, 39, 40). Twenty Gray
was administered when tumors reached 150 to 200 mm3. The

2,556 mm3, day 18; P = 0.041; Fig. 1A). Liposomal clodronate
also enhanced the antitumor effects of IR after tumors were
established compared with 20 Gy alone (2,678 ± 1,243 mm3
versus 4,599 ± 889 mm3, day 22; P = 0.071; Fig. 1B). We also

that tumor regrowth was significantly delayed compared
with IR alone (1,669 ± 749 mm3 versus 5,317 ± 1,322 mm3,

TNFα signaling in BMDMφ mediates tumor radioresistance. TNFα is reported to both enhance tumor growth and
mediate antitumor effects. To study the role of TNFα produced by macrophages, we cultured BMDMφ from WT and

or without macrophage depletion. WT BMT in TNFR1,2−/−
mice promoted tumor growth 30 days earlier than in
TNFR1,2−/− BMT mice, which was significantly delayed when
macrophages were depleted (867 ± 64 mm3 versus 4,353 ± 888
mm3, day 45; P = 0.013; Supplementary Fig. S4B). No significant difference was observed in TNFR1,2 −/− mice with
TNFR1,2−/− BMT when macrophages were depleted (65 ±
15 mm3 versus 73 ± 18 mm3, day 45; P = 0.549). In summary,
tumors grew more slowly in TNFR1,2−/− BMT mice, whereas
WT BMT permitted tumor growth. However, tumor growth
was suppressed when macrophages were depleted. These results suggest that autocrine/paracrine TNFα signaling in
BMDMφ is essential in promoting tumor growth.

coinjected with TNF−/−−/− BMDMφ (1,384 ± 553 mm3 versus
337 ± 261 mm3, day 22; P = 0.037; Fig. 2B and C). Our data
show that depletion of macrophages enhances the antitumor
effects of IR and coimplantation of macrophages reverses
this effect. These results also implicate macrophage-secreted
TNFα in the resistance of tumors to IR and suggest that
macrophage-derived TNFα and/or TNFα signaling in TAMφ
contributes in part to B16.SIY tumor radioresistance.
TNFα signaling in BMDMφ promotes tumor growth. To
investigate the role of TNFα produced specifically by
BMDMφ, we injected B16.SIY cells into TNF−/− mice transplanted with WT BM or TNF−/− BM. FACS analysis showed
that the BM was reconstituted with >70% of donor cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Animals underwent macrophage depletion with liposomal clodronate and tumor growth was
compared with controls. Tumor volume in WT BM transplant (BMT) mice was significantly reduced by macrophage
depletion (3,067 ± 615 mm3 versus 825 ± 174 mm3, day 60;
P = 0.017; Supplementary Fig. S4A). No tumor growth was
observed in TNF−/− BMT mice, showing an essential role

BMDMφ on B16.SIY tumor cell radiosensitivity and/or
growth in vitro. Supernatant from WT BMDMφ suppressed

from TNF −/− or TNFR1,2−/− BMDMφ had no effect (P =

TNFR1,2−/− supernatants in vitro differs from the in vivo findings with TNF−/− or TNFR1,2−/− macrophages. Supernatant

formation (P = 0.890). Supernatant collected from irradiated

BMDMφ are not exerted directly on tumor cells but likely on
nontumor cell constituents of the tumor microenvironment.
Induction of VEGF through TNFα/TNFR signaling in
TAMφ mediates rapid tumor regrowth following irradiation. In addition to TAMφ, tumor stroma is also composed
of matrix proteins and various cell types, including blood/
lymphatic vessels (41). Recent data suggest that TAMφ support tumor growth by contributing to angiogenesis and/or
vasculogenesis (41–44), in part mediated by TNFα. We used
a protein array and examined 62 cytokines and chemokines
in unirradiated BMDMφ and BMDMφ treated with 5 Gy. Unirradiated WT and TNFR1,2−/− BMDMφ produced similar cytokine/chemokine levels, including M-CSF, granulocyte CSF,
granulocyte macrophage CSF, CCL2, CCL9, IL-6, CXCL2, IL10, TNFα, and IL-12, and low levels of VEGF. Following 5 Gy,
there was a significant increase of VEGF in WT BMDMφ but
not TNFR1,2−/− BMDMφ, whereas TNFα was induced in both
WT and TNFR1,2−/− BMDMφ (Fig. 4A). These results were
confirmed by Luminex (Fig. 4B) and suggest that the induction of VEGF by IR is dependent on TNFα/TNFR autocrine/
paracrine signaling in BMDMφ. Our findings support the hypothesis that VEGF production in TAMφ through TNFα signaling activated by IR might play an important role in tumor
vessel repair and tumor regrowth.
We examined if irradiation leads to TNF/TNFR-mediated
upregulation of VEGF in tumor macrophages. We injected
B16.SIY cells into WT and TNFR1,2−/− mice and 20 Gy was
delivered when tumors reached 150 to 200 mm3. Tumors
were excised and digested into single-cell suspensions.
CD11b+ TAMφ were sorted and VEGF expression was assayed by Western blot and Luminex. Significantly higher levels of VEGF were detected in CD11b+ TAMφ isolated from
tumors grown in WT mice compared with TNFR1,2−/− mice
(P = 0.015; Fig. 5A and B). Increased TAMφ VEGF from tumors in WT mice was mirrored by increased tumor neovasculature/angiogenesis after IR was visualized in H&E- and
VEGFR2-stained tissue sections (Fig. 5C). We quantified
functional vascular structures showing intact blood perfusion by the presence of RBCs in VEFGR2+ vessels. In tumors
grown in TNFR1,2−/− mice, there were significantly decreased
functional vessels after IR compared with either untreated
control or tumors grown in WT after IR (P < 0.0001 and
P = 0.002, respectively; Fig. 5D). In addition, more surviving
tumor cells exhibiting intact morphology were present in irradiated tumors in WT compared with tumors in TNFR1,2−/−,
which showed greater radiosensitivity.
Depleting TNFα with Enbrel enhances tumor radiosensitivity. To test this hypothesis that TNFα blockade might be
clinically relevant, we injected B16.SIY cells into WT mice
and treated them with Enbrel + 20 Gy (32, 33). Enbrel-treated
animals had slightly larger tumors than untreated control animals. Mice treated with Enbrel + 20 Gy exhibited a reduction
in tumor regrowth compared with 20 Gy alone (153 ± 34 mm3
versus 440 ± 97 mm3, day 28; P = 0.022; Fig. 6A).
The observation that IR induced VEGF production by
macrophages via TNFα/TNFR signaling pathways led us to
examine the effect of pharmacologic TNFα inhibition and radiation on tumor angiogenesis. As with genetic deletion of

TNFR1,2, Enbrel treatment prevented upregulation of VEGF
by tumor macrophages in vivo (Fig. 6B and C). We next assessed the effect of IR + Enbrel on neovascularization. Radiation alone led to a significant reduction in microvessel
density as measured by VEGFR2+ [PBS (24 ± 1.8) versus
PBS + IR (4.1 ± 1.4); P < 0.0001]. Enbrel alone led to a modest
decrease in microvessel density [PBS (24 ± 1.8) versus Enbrel
(13 ± 1); P < 0.01], whereas Enbrel + IR significantly inhibited
angiogenesis when compared with all groups (2.75 ± 0.35 versus Enbrel alone, 13 ± 1, P < 0.0001; versus PBS + IR, 4.1 ± 1.4,
P < 0.01; Fig. 6D). NG2+ pericyte coverage was reduced in tumors treated with Enbrel compared with PBS (84 ± 2.3% versus 98 ± 0.2%; P < 0.001) and further decreased with Enbrel +
IR (57 ± 22.4%; P = 0.03, compared with Enbrel alone). Vascular size and morphology were also substantially affected by
treatment. For example, Enbrel + IR–treated tumors showed
narrow lumens suggestive of vascular collapse. Finally,
whereas radiation exposure led to vascular hemorrhage, the
addition of Enbrel intensified hemorrhagic necrosis and regression. These data show a profound effect of TNFα depletion + IR on angiogenesis and vascular function. Given that
irradiated macrophages upregulated VEGF expression, we
next hypothesized that blockade of VEGF would likewise enhance radiosensitivity. Treatment of mice with neutralizing
antibodies to VEGF led to increased radiosensitivity in
B16F1 (806.1 ± 329.1 versus IR alone, 2,101.8 ± 525.4; P =
0.05) and B16.SIY (0.5 ± 0.1 versus IR alone, 408.5 ± 65.1;
P = 0.005) tumors (Supplementary Fig. S7; ref. 38).

Discussion
We tested the hypothesis that depletion of TAMφ by liposomal clodronate would improve the antitumor effects of radiotherapy as determined by a delay of tumor regrowth. The
effects of macrophage depletion were most marked when
macrophages were depleted before tumors were established.
TAMφ have been reported to secrete a variety of cytokines
and other proteins that promote tumor growth. Our results
show that the intact TNFα/TNFR signaling in TAMφ is important in the autocrine/paracrine secretion of cytokines by
BMDMφ. TNFα is a proinflammatory cytokine that is cytotoxic to some tumor cell lines and tumors in vivo in high concentrations (45, 46). In our study, we were unable to show
that radioresistance was mediated by a direct effect on
B16.SIY cells using supernatant from WT BMDMφ. This
raised the possibility that TNFα-stimulated TAMφ promoted
radioresistance by effects on the tumor microenvironment.
TNFα at physiologic concentrations has recently been implicated in cancer induction and support of tumor angiogenesis, in part, through the attraction of BM-derived myeloid
precursor cells that contribute to tumor blood vessel formation and stabilization (42, 47). We investigated if TNF/TNFR
signaling in macrophages regulates the production of angiogenic cytokines by irradiated macrophages. Our data show
that inhibition of TNFR signaling by both genetic and pharmacologic means prevents increased production of VEGF by
irradiated macrophages. Immunohistochemical analyses
show that the combination of TNFα inhibition plus IR led

Targeting TNFα in TAMφ for Radiosensitization

to both significant decreases in neovascularization as well as
vascular function as evidenced by reduced pericyte coverage
and increased hemorrhage.
A recent report noted that macrophage-secreted VEGF
paradoxically slowed tumor growth in part by inducing tumor vessel abnormalities, such as tortuosity and leakiness,
resulting in tumor hypoxia, whereas tumor-secreted VEGF
“normalized” tumor vasculature (48). Interestingly, when
macrophage VEGF was deleted, tumors grew more rapidly
due to a more “normalized” vasculature but were also more
sensitive to cyclophosphamide. Our results are consistent
with this report, showing the Enbrel-treated tumors were
actually more sensitive to IR. In contrast to the report of
Stockmann and colleagues (48), TNFα blockade did not increase vessel pericyte coverage, suggesting that TNFR signaling in tumor macrophages likely affects several angiogenic
pathways in addition to VEGF. Nonetheless, blockade of
VEGF upregulation by inhibition of TNFα signaling represents an alternative clinically relevant method to enhance
radiosensitivity via targeting of TAMφ. Paradoxically, supernatant from macrophages defective in TNF signaling through
germline deletions in TNF or TNFR1,2 conferred modest radioprotection on B16.SIY cells in vitro through an unknown
mechanism. Together, these data suggest that macrophage
blockade mediates in vivo radiosensitivity predominantly
through effects on the microenvironment. Active TNFα signaling in irradiated macrophages seems necessary for upregulation of macrophage-derived VEGF, resulting in enhanced
preservation of the irradiated vasculature.
Tumor angiogenesis is distinguished from postnatal vasculogenesis in that tumor angiogenesis is proposed to occur
through endothelial migration and sprouting from preexisting
blood vessels, whereas vasculogenesis is proposed to occur by
the recruitment of BM cells to the site of tumor angiogenesis or
local inflammatory damage. Although vasculogenesis was previously described as direct incorporation of progenitor cells into newly emerging vasculature, it also involves the recruitment
of BM-derived angiogenic populations that enhance angiogenesis through paracrine mechanisms. The extent to which tumor neovascularization depends on local endothelial cells or
infiltrating angiogenic cells is controversial. Recently, tumor regrowth by local myelomonocytic CD11b+ cells was reported to
induce tumor vasculogenesis following irradiation through secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in a model where tumor
angiogenesis was suppressed by prior irradiation of the tumor
bed (25). Additionally TAMφ secrete a variety of proangiogenic
proteins, including IL-8, TNFα, and VEGF. Therefore, both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis may be supported by TAMφderived factors. Whereas our data using Enbrel suggest that
pharmacologic inhibition of macrophage TNFR signaling enhances radiosensitivity, our liposomal clodronate data show
that reducing macrophage populations in tumors represents
another potential antiangiogenic and antivasculogenic strategy. Systemically delivering liposomal clodronate to patients
may not be feasible. However, CSF-1 receptor kinase inhibitors
may block macrophage differentiation and function, providing
an alternative biological tool to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production from macrophages (49). The availability of

www.aacrjournals.org

these small molecules and monoclonal antibodies targeting either CSF-1R or CSF-1 to deplete TAMφ number and function
may allow us to translate these strategies to promote radiosensitivity in future studies.
We also report that blocking VEGF enhances the effect of
IR (38, 50). Although anti-VEGF therapy could block VEGF
derived from either vasculogenic myeloid populations or tumor cells, our results confirm that direct VEGF blockade is
another therapeutic strategy to increase radiosensitivity. Despite the clear correlation between tumor vascularization
and VEGF expression, TNF can also modulate the expression
of other antiangiogenic factors, including thrombospondin
and angiostatic chemokines such as CXCL10 and CXCL9.
Therefore, targeting the TNFα/TNFR signaling in TAMφ
may enhance radiosensitivity through additional pathways
beyond VEGF signaling.
In summary, we used both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of TNFα signaling to study the role of tumor macrophages in promoting tumor radioresistance. Rather than
directly affecting tumor cells, active TNFα signaling in irradiated macrophages results in the production of angiogenic
cytokines such as VEGF. We have used coimplantation models to show that macrophages are sufficient for this effect
and liposomal clodronate to show that macrophages are required. Although liposomal clodronate might have off-target
cellular affects, previous studies suggest that liposomal clodronate selectively depletes macrophages as opposed to other hematopoietic cells. Because the effects of liposomal
clodronate on other stromal components remain unclear,
we also used BM transplantation studies together with liposomal clodronate to study the effects of depletion of BMderived cells. It nonetheless remains possible that active
TNFα signaling in cellular components of the microenvironment might mediate radioresistance as well. Other limitations of our study include (a) the lack of a tissue-specific
promoter such as LysM to delete TNFα specifically in myeloid cells, (b) identification of which BMDMφ populations
(M1 versus M2) mediate tumor vascular formation/stabilization following IR, and (c) whether VEGF secreted by macrophages attracts additional local angiogenic cells, which
contribute to tumor vascularization and regrowth following
radiotherapy. In spite of these caveats, our results suggest
that blockade of TNF/TNFR signaling in TAMφ is an attractive target to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy.
