ABSTRACT
Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) plays an important role in controlling cancer
cell survival. IAPs have therefore attracted considerable attention as potential targets
in anticancer therapy. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of AZD5582,
a novel small-molecule IAP inhibitor, in human pancreatic cancer cells. Treating human
pancreatic cancer cells with AZD5582 differentially induced apoptosis, dependent on
the expression of p-Akt and p-XIAP. Moreover, the knockdown of endogenous Akt or
XIAP via RNA interference in pancreatic cancer cells, which are resistant to AZD5582,
resulted in increased sensitivity to AZD5582, whereas ectopically expressing Akt or
XIAP led to resistance to AZD5582. Additionally, AZD5582 targeted cIAP1 to induce
TNF-α-induced apoptosis. More importantly, AZD5582 induced a decrease of Mcl-1
protein, a member of the Bcl-2 family, but not that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Interestingly,
ectopically expressing XIAP and cIAP1 inhibited the AZD5582-induced decrease of
Mcl-1 protein, which suggests that AZD5582 elicits Mcl-1 decrease for apoptosis
induction by targeting of XIAP and cIAP1. Taken together, these results indicate
that sensitivity to AZD5582 is determined by p-Akt-inducible XIAP phosphorylation
and by targeting cIAP1. Furthermore, Mcl-1 in pancreatic cancer may act as a potent
marker to analyze the therapeutic effects of AZD5582.

INTRODUCTION

by targeting XIAP and cIAP1. Our results also reveal the
mechanism underlying the resistance to synthetic IAP
antagonist, AZD5582.

The mortality rate of pancreatic carcinomas, which
have a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%, is among
the highest of all human cancer types [1]. Resistance
of pancreatic cancers to even aggressive treatment
regimens presents a major challenge in oncology. An
underlying feature of this refractoriness to treatment, and
a contributor to the aggressive nature of the disease, is
apoptosis resistance. Previous studies in pancreatic cancer
have described multiple defects in apoptosis signaling
at different levels of the pathway [2]. Pancreatic cancer
cells gain protection against the mitochondrial-dependent
apoptotic pathway through overexpression of inhibitor of
apoptosis proteins (IAPs), which are inhibitors of caspases
[3], as well as through dysregulation of other apoptosismodulating genes [4]. Understanding these mechanisms,
which might have great potential as targets for overcoming
therapy-resistance of human pancreatic cancer, has opened
novel strategies for anticancer drug development.
IAPs appear to be essential for regulating the
apoptotic program. IAPs contain one to three baculovirus
IAP repeat (BIR) domains and one RING finger domain,
the latter of which possesses E3 ligase activity [5]. The
BIR domains of XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2 directly bind,
and subsequently inhibit, caspases [6]. This inhibition can
be abolished by IAP antagonists, such as Smac/Diablo
[7, 8]. The C-terminal RING finger domain of IAPs
regulates a number of protein targets by promoting their
ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation [9].
Previous studies have shown that IAPs are overexpressed
in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer [3, 10, 11]
and have implicated IAPs in tumor cell survival [12].
Natural IAP antagonists, including Grim and Smac/
Diablo, have been shown to bind to the same groove
in the BIR domains of IAPs as inhibitors of caspases
[13]. Synthetic IAP antagonist compounds that mimic
natural IAP antagonists have been designed based on this
inhibitory mechanism. Such mimetic IAP antagonists have
been developed using a variety of approaches, including
large-scale combinational library screening [14]. These
compounds have been shown to enhance the efficacy of
chemotherapy and suppress tumor cell survival [15, 16].
To date, other groups are reported that IAP antagonist or
SMAC minetic are potentiated anti-tumor effects in human
pancreatic cancer cell lines [17–19]. These studies have
evaluated the efficacy of IAP antagonists with chemoagents against pancreatic cancer. However, no studies
have demonstrated the sensitive or resistant mechanisms
of IAP antagonists against pancreatic cancer cell lines.
Moreover, the mechanism of action for IAP antagonists
and the processes involved in resistance to these agents
have not been widely investigated.
Here, we demonstrate that AZD5582, a synthetic
small molecule and member of the IAP antagonist family
[20], induces apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells

RESULTS
Human pancreatic cancer cells display different
sensitivities to the synthetic IAP antagonist,
AZD5582
To validate the effect of AZD5582, we first examined
its inhibitory effect on multiple human pancreatic cancer
cell lines as a single agent. Differences were observed
in the sensitivities of pancreatic cancer cell lines to
AZD5582. BxPC-3 and PanC-1 cells were sensitive to the
compound (Figure 1A and 1B), exhibiting IC50 values
for AZD5582 of 23 nM and 110.8 nM, respectively.
In contrast, all other cells exhibited resistance to
AZD5582, with the exception of both cell types mentioned
above (Figure 1A). We determined resistance cut-off value
based on IC50 for AZD5582. Resistance cell lines exhibit
pXIAP and pAKT expression. Panc08.13 and Capan-2
had 2uM IC50 for AZD5582 and exhibited pXIAP and
pAKT. Thus, these cell lines can be considered similar to
other resistance cell lines. Therefore, we can assume that
BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cell lines are sensitive and that other
cell lines are resistant to AZD5582. We next examined
the inhibitory effect of AZD5582 on BxPC-3 and Panc-1
cells that were sensitive to AZD5582. AZD5582-induced
apoptosis was measured the percentage of annexin V/PIpositive cells using flow cytometry. (Figure 1B, upper
panel). AZD5582 induced the cleavage of caspase-3,
resulting in active caspase-3, but only in the BxPC-3 &
PanC-1 cell lines which were sensitive to AZD5582
(Figure 1B, lower panel), indicating that pancreatic cancer
cells have differential sensitivity to AZD5582. Colony
formation in both cell types significantly decreased after
treatment with AZD5582 (Figure 1C), but not in cells that
were resistant to AZD5582 (Supplementary Figure S1).
In addition, we investigated whether AZD5582 inhibited
tumor growth in Panc-1-derived xenograft model. After
AZD5582 treatment, tumor growth and weight decreased,
whereas cleaved caspase 3 expression increased. We
analyzed apoptotic protein by Tunel assay (Figure 1D).

Phospho-AKT-inducible XIAP phosphorylation
induces resistance to AZD5582
As shown in Figure 1, the human pancreatic
cancer cell lines tested displayed different sensitivities
to AZD5582, with Capan-2 and AsPC-1 cells displaying
resistance to AZD5582. Consistently, the cleavage of
caspase-3 was observed in AZD5582-sensitive cells,
but not in AZD5582-resistant cells. Based on a report
demonstrating that XIAP directly inhibits active caspase-3
[21], we investigated the inhibitory effect of AZD5582

cancer cells. BxPC-3, Capan-2 (left panel), Panc-1 and AsPC-1 cells (right panel) were treated with AZD5582 at the indicated doses for

on XIAP. XIAP expression was significantly decreased
after exposure to AZD5582 in BxPC-3 and PanC-1 cells
that are sensitive to AZD5582, but not in Capan-2 and
AsPC-1 cells that are resistant to AZD5582 (Figure 2A).
To further analyze whether the difference in sensitivity to
AZD5582 is dependent on XIAP, we first selected the two
pancreatic cancer cells, BxPC-3 and PanC-1, sensitive to
AZD5582. BxPC-3 and PanC-1 cells were transfected
with a construct expressing XIAP cDNA, or a control
vector, followed by AZD5582 treatment. Cells expressing
ectopic XIAP displayed decreased sensitivity to AZD5582
(Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2A). However,
transfection with XIAP did not completely inhibit the
cleavage of caspase-3 after treatment with AZD5582.
Next, we examined the effects of XIAP silencing via
small interfering RNA (siRNA) on two pancreatic cancer
cell lines, Capan-2 and AsPC-1, which are resistant to
AZD5582. XIAP knockdown resulted in increased cell
death in both cell types after exposure to AZD5582
(Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S2B). These results
suggested that AZD5582 induces apoptotic cell death
through the inhibition of XIAP in pancreatic cancer cells.
It has previously been reported that XIAP
phosphorylation by AKT protects XIAP from
ubiquitination and degradation in response to apoptotic
stress [22]. Thus, to investigate the mechanism underlying
the resistance to AZD5582, we first examined the basal
levels of phospho-AKT and phospho-XIAP in the four
pancreatic cancer cell lines. Consistent with a role for
the previously reported AKT-dependent resistance
mechanism, we found that both AKT and XIAP were
phosphorylated in resistant Capan-2 and AsPC-1 cells,
but not in sensitive BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells (Figure 2D),
suggesting that the phosphorylation of XIAP by phosphoAKT induces resistance to AZD5582. In view of these
results, we evaluated the levels of phospho-XIAP and
phospho-AKT in human pancreatic normal and cancer
tissues. Interestingly, phosphorylated XIAP was found
in 7 of 24 human pancreatic cancer tissues, but was
almost undetectable in normal tissues. Furthermore, we
observed a significant relationship between phosphoAKT and phospho-XIAP expression in tissue samples
from patients with pancreatic cancer. However, the
expression of the other phosphorylated proteins, with the
exception of phospho-XIAP expression, was detected in
normal and cancer tissues (Figure 2E and Supplementary
Figure S3). This finding supports the potential value of
AZD5582 therapy for pancreatic cancer patients; however,
prospective patients should be evaluated for their phosphoXIAP status.
To confirm that the phosphorylation of AKT
induces resistance to AZD5582, we examined the effects
of AKT silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA) on
two pancreatic cancer cell lines, Capan-2 and AsPC-1.
AKT knockdown caused a decrease of phospho-XIAP
levels (Figure 2F). Consistently, the apoptotic-cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

population significantly increased in cells expressing
AKT-siRNA followed by AZD5582 treatment (Figure 2F
and Supplementary Figure S2C). To further study the
relationship between XIAP phosphorylation and resistance
to AZD5582, we constructed a mutant XIAP (HA-tagged
XIAP-S87D) in which Ser-87 was replaced with aspartic
acid. As expected, apoptotic cell death decreased in
BxPC-3 and PanC-1 cells transfected with the mutant
XIAP (HA-tagged XIAP-S87D) following AZD5582
treatment (Figure 2G and Supplementary Figure S2D).
These results suggest that the phosphorylation of XIAP by
AKT induces resistance to AZD5582, and further indicates
that the phosphorylation of both AKT and XIAP in human
pancreatic cancer may be a predictive biomarker for the
efficacy of AZD5582 treatment.

The synthetic IAP antagonist AZD5582 decreases
growth of tumors bearing ASPC-1 and Capan-2
that stably express AKT-shRNA
Because AKT positively regulates XIAP protein
stability by inhibiting its degradation, and AKT
knockdown resulted in XIAP degradation, as described
above. We posited that AKT might function as a
resistance factor against AZD5582 by stabilizing XIAP.
To test this possibility, we examined the inhibitory
effect of AKT knockdown on the induction of cell
death after exposure to AZD5582. We first established
derivatives of Capan-2 and AsPC-1 cell lines that stably
express doxycycline-inducible AKT-shRNA vectors.
Treatment with doxycycline clearly led to decreased
XIAP expression and phosphorylation in Capan-2 and
AsPC-1 cells that express doxycycline-inducible AKTshRNA vectors (Figure 3A). Conversely, apoptotic
cell death in Capan-2 and AsPC-1 derivatives was
significantly increased after exposure to doxycycline, but
not in derivatives that were not treated with doxycycline
(Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S4). Additionally,
AKT can induce resistance to AZD5582 by stabilizing the
XIAP protein. We next investigated the effects of AKT
on AZD5582-induced XIAP ubiquitination. Capan-2
and AsPC-1 AKT shRNA inducible cells were treated
with doxycycline and AZD5582 in the presence/absence
of MG132. Ubiquitination of XIAP was analyzed by
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting after 24 h of
the treatment. As shown in Figure 3B, AZD5582 induces
ubiquitination of XIAP that was significantly inhibited by
AKT expression (Figure 3B). Taken together, we conclude
that AKT can induce resistance to AZD5582 by stabilizing
the XIAP protein.
To further examine the inhibitory effect of AZD5582
on Capan-2 and AsPC-1 derivative cell lines, we
established each derivative-bearing mouse xenografts with
a doxycycline-inducible stable depletion of AKT. Cells
from each derivative were subcutaneously injected into
mice and allowed to form xenograft tumors, and they were

then treated with doxycycline or vehicle. Tumors derived
from derivative-inducible, stable clones of Capan-2 and
AsPC-1 derivatives showed decreased AKT levels after
an injection of doxycycline (Figure 3C). Tumor growth in
doxycycline-treated mice was slightly inhibited, because
AKT expression was decreased. In addition, tumor
growth in doxycyclin-treated mice was clearly decreased
compared with that in control mice treated with vehicle
alone in the presence of AZD5582. However, tumor
growth was not changed, although we administrated
AZD5582 in the Capan-2 and AsPC-1-derived xenograft
models (Figure 3D). Next, we analyzed AKT and XIAP
expression using immunohistochemistry and detected
apoptotic protein by Tunel assay. Expression of these
proteins was decreased in tissues from doxycyclinetreated mice from the Capan-2 and AsPC-1 derivativexenograft (Figure 3E). Consistently, western blot analysis
also showed decreases of these protein levels (Figure 3C),
indicating that AZD5582 can suppress tumor growth in
combination with AKT inhibition.

we investigated whether AZD5582 targets cIAP1 in our
system. Treatment with AZD5582 resulted in a decreased
level of cIAP1 in BxPC-3 and PanC-1 cells which are
sensitive to AZD5582, but not in Capan-2 and AsPC-1
cells, which are resistant to AZD5582 (Figure 4D). To
further confirm the involvement of cIAP1 in AZD5582induced cell death, we transfected cells with a construct
expressing cIAP1 cDNA following AZD5582 treatment.
The expression of cIAP1 inhibited AZD5582-induced cell
death and TNFα production (Figure 4E and Supplementary
Figure S7B), indicating that AZD5582 targets cIAP1 in
human pancreatic cancer cells.

AZD5582-induced cell death can be completely
blocked by the inhibition of both XIAP and
cIAP1
As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 4, the expression
of XIAP or cIAP1 partially inhibited AZD5582-induced
cell death, respectively. We therefore tested whether
the expression of both XIAP and cIAP1 fully inhibits
AZD5582-induced cell death. To do this, we transfected
cells with constructs expressing XIAP and/or cIAP1
cDNA, followed by AZD5582 treatment. BxPC-3 cells,
displaying sensitivities to AZD5582 and expressing both
XIAP and cIAP1 were more resistant to AZD5582 than
those transfected with either XIAP or cIAP1 (Figure 5A
and Supplementary Figure S8A, i). Consistently, apoptoticcell populations in PanC-1 cells expressing both cDNA
clearly decreased after exposure to AZD5582 (Figure 5B
and Supplementary Figure S8A, ii). To further examine this,
we used wild-type, XIAP-knockout and cIAP1-knockout
MEFs (Figure 5C). Wild-type MEFs were insensitive to
AZD5582, whereas the cell death rate in XIAP-knockout
or cIAP1-knockout MEFs was significantly increased after
exposure to AZD5582 (Figure 5D and Supplementary
Figure S8B). Consistent with these results, cIAP1 levels in
XIAP-knockout, or XIAP levels in cIAP1-knockout MEFs
was decreased in response to AZD5582, suggesting that the
inhibition of both XIAP and cIAP1 is required to kill these
AZD5582-sensitive pancreatic cancer cells.

AZD5582 induces apoptotic cell death through
TNFα-dependent cIAP1 degradation
It has been reported that IAP antagonists inhibit
cIAP1 to induce TNFα-dependent apoptosis [16].
We therefore analyzed the involvement of TNF-R in
AZD5582-induced apoptotic cell death. We first examined
the knockdown effect of TNFR1- and TNFR2-siRNA on
BxPC-3 and PanC-1 cells which are sensitive to AZD5582.
The number of dead cells decreased in TNFR1, and
TNFR2-siRNA-treated BxPC-3 or PanC-1 cells following
AZD5582 treatment (Figure 4A and Supplementary
Figure S5). In particular, TNFR1 knockdown resulted
in less cell death compared with TNFR2-knockdown,
implying that AZD5582 may induce cell death via the
TNFR signaling pathway. To confirm whether AZD5582
induced TNFR-related apoptotic cell death, we first
examined TNFα production after exposure to AZD5582.
Treatment with AZD5582 resulted in TNFα production in
BxPC-3 and PanC-1 cells which are sensitive to AZD5582
(Figure 4B). In contrast, resistance cell lines did not
produce TNFα under AZD5582 treatment (Supplementary
Figure S6). To next determine whether cell death induced
by AZD5582 required TNFα, we incubated AZD5582sensitive cells with AZD5582 in the presence or absence of
antibodies that block TNFα. Consistent with a requirement
for TNFα, AZD5582-induced cell death was dramatically
inhibited after exposure to TNFα-blocking antibodies
(Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S7A), suggesting
that TNFα production elicited by AZD5582 can induce
apoptotic cell death in human pancreatic cancer cells.
TNFα production induced by AZD5582 was
significantly correlated with the induction of apoptosis.
Recently, it has been reported that IAP antagonists target
cIAP1 to induce TNFα-dependent apoptosis. Accordingly,

Overexpression and stabilization of Mcl-1
renders resistance to AZD5582
As demonstrated by the above results, AZD5582
induces cell death by targeting XIAP and cIAP1. We
therefore investigated whether AZD5582 affects other
anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 family members
(Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1), or survivin. We first observed
a change of these protein levels in cells expressing both
XIAP and cIAP1, or in cells expressing an empty vector
after exposure to AZD5582. Surprisingly, treatment
with AZD5582 resulted in a decrease of Mcl-1 levels in
cells expressing the control vector, whereas the level of
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or survivin was not changed (Figure 6A).

Furthermore, Mcl-1 levels in cells expressing XIAP
and cIAP1 were not affected by AZD5582 (Figure 6A).
Next, we analyzed the effect of AZD5582 on these antiapoptotic proteins using XIAP or cIAP1 silencing via
small interfering RNA (siRNA). The knockdown of both
XIAP and cIAP1 resulted in a decrease of Mcl-1 protein
levels, whereas the levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or survivin
were not decreased (Figure 6B). The cell death rate
dramatically increased in XIAP- and cIAP1-siRNA-treated
Capan-2 cells that are resistant to AZD5582 (Figure 6B
and Supplementary Figure S9A), suggesting that Mcl-1
inhibition is required for AZD5582-induced cell death.
To further analyze whether AZD5582-induced
cell death is dependent on Mcl-1 protein, we transfected

AZD5582-sensitive cells with a construct expressing
Mcl-1 cDNA following AZD5582 treatment. The
expression of Mcl-1 confers resistance to AZD5582,
similarly to the effects of XIAP and cIAP1 expression
(Figure 6C and Supplementary Figure S9B). Consistently,
the cleavage of caspase-3 was not observed in cells
expressing Mcl-1 after exposure to AZD5582. Next,
we further confirmed the involvement of Mcl-1 in
AZD5582-induced cell death. Based on reports [23–25],
Mcl-1 is a protein that experiences rapid turnover and is
quickly degraded upon a variety of apoptosis-inducing
signals (Supplementary Figure S10). In contrast, mutant
(constitutive active form) Mcl-1 is resistant to apoptosisinducing agents. Thus, we demonstrated that Mcl-1

mutants overcome AZD5582-induced apoptosis. On the
other hand, no investigation has reported on the inactive
non-phosphorylated form of Mcl-1. To do this, we first
constructed wild-type Mcl-1 and constitutively active
mutants-Mcl-1 (Myc-tagged Mcl-1-STAA and -K3R), in
which alanine was substituted for phosphorylated amino
acid sites in the domain. Then, we examined whether wildtype Mcl-1, -STAA or -K3R renders AZD5582-sensitive
BxPC3 cells and PanC-1 cells resistant to AZD5582 by
comparing the apoptotic-cell populations in AZD5582treated BxPC3 and PanC-1 cells expressing wild-type
Mcl-1, -STAA or -K3R with those in cells transfected
with an empty vector. Cells expressing wild-type Mcl-1,
-STAA or -K3R were more resistant to AZD5582 than
those transfected with an empty vector (Figure 6D and
Supplementary Figure S9C), indicating that the expression
of Mcl-1 and the stabilization induced by mutating the
domain within it renders cells resistant to AZD5582

that AZD5582 interacted with cIAP1 by SPR (Surface
plasmon resonance) analysis (Supplementary Figure S11).
Unlike cIAP1, cIAP2 protein levels were not decreased
in AZD5582-sensitive cell lines. No mutations known
to affect the stability of IAP proteins were found in the
RING domain of cIAP2 in the AZD5582- sensitive cell
lines, BxPC-3 and Panc-1 (Supplementary Figure S12).
Furthermore, AZD5582 significantly increased tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNFα) production in AZD5582sensitive BxPC3 cells (Figure 4), but not in AZD5582resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S6). These results
are in accord with previous reports that cells sensitive
to Smac mimetics produce or can be induced to produce
more TNFα after exposure to a Smac mimetic [16].
Therefore, these findings indicate that the novel synthetic
IAP antagonist, AZD5582, induces apoptosis in pancreatic
cancer cells. However, the relationship between AZD5582
and cIAP1 to protein stability in AZD5582-resistant cells
remains to be elucidated.
Collectively, these data suggest that XIAP
phosphorylation can be used as a predictive biomarker for
the efficacy of AZD5582 in pancreatic cancer treatment,
and the use of therapeutic agents that interfere with
IAP expression or function, such as AZD5582, may be
a promising approach for the treatment of pancreatic
cancer and are attractive as adjuvants to conventional
chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
Because pancreatic cancer exhibits resistance to
apoptosis inducers, such as gemcitabine, chemotherapeutic
options are limited, and such agents only minimally
enhance survival [1]. Therapies that increase apoptosis,
an event that is critically important for the inhibition
of tumorigenesis, are highly attractive for treatment of
pancreatic cancers as well as other solid tumors. Among
the cellular factors that play a key role in regulating
apoptosis are IAPs, which, studies have shown, are
pathologically overexpressed in pancreatic cancer [3].
These observations motivated our exploration of IAPinhibition as a therapeutic strategy in pancreatic cancer.
In this study, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of the
novel synthetic IAP antagonist, AZD5582, on pancreatic
cancer cells. Our in vitro data showed that Panc-1 and
BxPC-3 cells were sensitive to AZD5582, and experiments
using a xenograft mouse model showed that AZD5582 was
effective against tumors of Capan-2 or AsPC-1 derivativexenografts in vivo.
AZD5582 did not induce a decrease in IAP levels
in Capan-2 or AsPC-1 cells, which exhibited resistance
to apoptosis. It was recently reported that phospho-AKT
induces phosphorylation at Ser87 in the N-terminus of
XIAP, resulting in XIAP stabilization [22]. Interestingly,
our data also demonstrated that the phosphorylation
of AKT and XIAP in the AZD5582-resistant cell lines
Capan-2 and AsPC-1, but not in AZD5582-sensitive
BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells. The exogenous expression
of XIAP S87D resulted in resistance to AZD5582 in
AZD5582-sensitive BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells, suggesting
that the phosphorylation of XIAP renders cells resistant to
AZD5582, suggesting that AZD5582 can suppress growth
of tumors in combination with AKT inhibition.
Importantly, cIAP1 was also degraded in BxPC-3 and
Panc-1 cells after exposure to AZD5582. We demonstrated

The human pancreatic cancer cell lines including BxPC-3,
Miapaca-2, Panc-1, Panc0813, PL45, Capan-1, Capan-2
and AsPC-1 were purchased from ATCC (American Type
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). All cells were
cultured according to the ATCC’s recommended guide
lines. XIAP and cIAP1 null mouse embryonic fibroblast
cells were kindly provided by Dr. Colin S. Duckett
(University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and
Dr. Robert Korneluk (Ontario Cancer Institute, USA),
respectively. Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor,

arginine (Mcl-1K3R), were constructed using the
PCR-based Quik ChangeSite-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Intron  biotechnology, Seoul, Republic of Korea).
Human pancreatic cancer cells were transiently transfected
with scrambled (control) siRNA or siRNA against XIAP,
Akt, cIAP1, TNFR1 or TNFR2 (150 pmol siRNA per 60 mm
dish) using Lipofect-AMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). The siRNAs used targeted the following

USA) or phosphor-XIAP (Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit
or donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies, as appropriate
and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
reagents (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Human
normal and cancerous pancreatic tissues were obtained
from pancreatic cancer patients after obtaining informed
consent. The biospecimen and data used in this study was
provided by Asan Bio-Resource Center.

Annexin V or Annexin V/PI staining
The cells were harvested, washed with PBS and
incubated with Annexin V binding buffer according to
manufacturer’s instructions. And then the cells stained
with Annexin V or Annexin V/PI. Flow cytometry analyses
performed on a FACS Calibur, Canto (BD Bioscience) or
Muse (Millipore) instruments.

Cell death and MTS assay
DNA or siRNA-transfected or AZD5582-treated cells
were collected and cell death was determined by trypan
blue exclusion using at least 200~500 cells. For the MTS
assay, pancreatic cancer cells were seeded at 1~3 × 104
cells/well in a 96-well microtiter plate. The following day,
cells were treated with AZD5582, an IAP antagonist, with
various doses for 72 h. The MTS assay was performed
according to the MTS assay protocol (Promega Inc,
Madison, WI, USA). The IC50 of AZD5582 was determined
using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 software.

In vivo tumor xenografts and
immunohistochemistry
Xenograft tumor growth in Balb/c nude mice
was used as a model for in vivo experiments. All
animal studies were conducted in compliance with
animal protocols approved by the Asan Medical Center
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Panc-1 and doxycycline-inducible Akt shRNA stable
cell lines (Capan-2 and Aspc-1) were harvested and
resuspended in matrigel at a concentration of 1 × 107 or
5 × 106 cells/100 μl, and the cells were then implanted
subcutaneously. When tumor sizes reached 100 mm3, the
mice were administered 10 mg/kg doxycycline (day 0),
delivered in water, and the tumor volumes were monitored
for 3 weeks. Mice were administered vehicle or the
indicated concentrations of AZD5582 by i.v. once a week
for three weeks, and the tumors were measured every 3
days for 3 weeks. Body weights were monitored every 3
days for 3 weeks. At 3 weeks, tumors were excised and
fixed in formalin. XIAP and AKT were detected in tumor
tissues by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical
analyses were performed as previously described [26].
Tumor tissues were examined histogically by hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining. And detection of apoptotic
cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Roche) was performed.
All mouse experiments were approved by the animal
care committee at Asan Institute for Life Science, Asan
Medical Center (Seoul, Republic of Korea) and were
performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and
regulations.

Doxycycline-inducible Akt shRNA stable
cell lines
AsPC-1 and Capan-2 cells were co-transfected
with pcDNA6.0/TR (Invitrogen) and H1-Akt shRNAexpressing plasmids and then selected by treating with
blasticidin (5 μg/ml) and zeocin (150 μg/ml) for 3 weeks.
To verify the Akt-inducible stable cell line, selected cells
were treated with doxycycline for 48 h and then confirmed
with immunoblot analysis for downregulating Akt using
anti-Akt antibodies.

Immunoblot analysis
Immunoblot analyses were performed by preparing
cell lysates in RIPA lysis buffer containing proteaseand phosphatase-inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Protein
concentrations were determined using the Bradford
assay, and 20 μg of total cellular protein per sample were
resolved by 8~15% SDS-PAGE then transferred to an
Immobilon-P membrane (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA). Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk
in TBS-T buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl
and 0.1% Tween 20) and probed with antibodies against
HA, Akt, γ-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), cIAP1, XIAP, Mcl-1, myc, phospho-AKT, survivin,
