The MYC oncoprotein is a transcription factor that coordinates cell growth and division. MYC overexpression
exacerbates genomic instability and sensitizes cells to
apoptotic stimuli. Here we demonstrate that MYC directly stimulates transcription of the human Werner
syndrome gene, WRN, which encodes a conserved RecQ
helicase. Loss-of-function mutations in WRN lead to genomic instability, an elevated cancer risk, and premature
cellular senescence. The overexpression of MYC in
WRN syndrome fibroblasts or after WRN depletion from
control fibroblasts led to rapid cellular senescence that
could not be suppressed by hTERT expression. We propose that WRN up-regulation by MYC may promote
MYC-driven tumorigenesis by preventing cellular senescence.

multiple myeloma (Nesbit et al. 1999). The MYC oncoprotein is a basic helix–loop–helix–leucine zipper
(bHLHZIP) transcription factor that through dimerization with MAX protein binds to specific DNA elements
(“E boxes”) and modulates transcription of a wide variety
of genes (for review, see Dang 1999; Grandori et al. 2000;
Oster et al. 2002). The proteins encoded by MYC transcriptional target genes appear to regulate cell-cycle progression and cell growth while sensitizing cells to apoptotic stimuli (Evan et al. 1992). MYC may also be able
to promote tumorigenesis by up-regulating the expression of genes such as hTERT that play a role in cellular
immortalization or the escape from senescence (Wang et
al. 1998a; Greenberg et al. 1999; Wu et al. 1999). We
reasoned that MYC might modulate the expression of
other genes that control cellular senescence, and thus
determined whether the gene encoding the Werner syndrome RecQ helicase protein is a MYC transcriptional
target.
Werner syndrome (WRN) is an uncommon, autosomal
recessive genetic instability syndrome that results from
loss-of-function mutations in the chromosome 8p12p11.2 WRN gene (Yu et al. 1996). The WRN phenotype
resembles premature aging, and includes genomic instability, an elevated risk of malignancy, and accelerated
cellular senescence. Genetic instability following loss of
the 162-kD WRN RecQ helicase protein reflects the
physiologic role of WRN in mitotic recombination and
repair (Brosh and Bohr 2002; Saintigny et al. 2002). Conversely, the elevated levels of WRN observed in immortalized and human tumor cell lines may help insure continuous cell proliferation (Shiratori et al. 1999). In order
to delineate potential interactions between MYC and
WRN in tumorigenesis, we determined whether WRN
expression is modulated by MYC, and monitored cellular responses to MYC overexpression in the absence of
WRN. The results indicated that WRN expression appears to be required to avoid cellular senescence upon
MYC up-regulation in hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts.
Results and Discussion
c-myc and WRN expression are tightly linked
To determine whether MYC regulates WRN expression,
we first correlated c-myc and WRN expression levels in
different cell lines in which MYC expression was constitutively or could be conditionally altered. Analysis of
WRN expression in EBV-immortalized B cells that constitutively expressed high levels of c-myc and max, max
alone, or neither gene demonstrated the coordinate expression of c-myc and WRN:WRN mRNA was expressed at high levels only in B cells that constitutively
overexpressed myc and max (Fig. 1A; Gu et al. 1993).
High constitutive c-myc and WRN mRNA levels were
also found in human U937 leukemia cells, and both myc
and WRN mRNA levels were coordinately down-regulated after TPA-induced differentiation (Fig. 1B). To determine the kinetics of induction of WRN by MYC, we
used the B-cell line P-493-6, which expresses a Tet-myc
repressible gene (Schuhmacher et al. 1999). Northern
analysis indicated that c-myc induction was closely followed by an increase in steady-state WRN mRNA levels
(Fig. 1C). There was also a parallel increase in MYC and

leads to a rapid increase in WRN mRNA (Fig. 1E). WRN
mRNA up-regulation by MYC-ERTM was found to be
cycloheximide-resistant (Fig. 1E, right panel). This result
is consistent with WRN being a direct target of the MYC
oncoprotein.

times to 4-OHT to induce MYC-ERTM in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. PhosphorImager quantitation of data in
E indicated an approximately fivefold induction of WRN mRNA
relative to actin by MYC-ERTM and approximately fourfold
with cycloheximide, compared with an ∼1.2-fold increase due to
cycloheximide addition to control EREB cells not expressing
MYC-ERTM.

expressing EBNA2-ER (EBNA2 fused to the estrogen receptor, ER) and MYC-ERTM chimeric proteins (Littlewood et al. 1995). The MYC-ERTM chimeric protein contains a mutant estrogen receptor domain (ERTM) that is
selectively activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT).
Upon estrogen removal, EBNA2-ER is inactivated and
cells undergo cell-cycle arrest. Addition of 4-OHT preferentially activates the MYC-ERTM fusion protein, and

GENES & DEVELOPMENT

To establish whether MYC directly regulates WRN expression, we explored the WRN promoter region for the
presence of MYC–MAX consensus elements. This search
revealed several noncanonical MYC–MAX-binding sites
(Grandori and Eisenman 1997) in close proximity to the
transcriptional start (sites A and B; Fig. 2A; Yamabe et al.
1998). The B site consists of two overlapping sites (BI and
BII). Mobility shift assays demonstrated that these potential target sites could be bound in vitro by purified
MYC–MAX heterodimers (Fig. 2A). Point mutations in
sites A and B reduced binding to ∼35% of wild type (Fig.
2A). Residual binding is likely due to several half-sites
adjacent to the mutated site (C. Grandori, unpubl.). In
vitro DNAseI footprinting demonstrated MYC–MAX
heterodimer-dependent protection of the A and B binding sites and immediate flanking nucleotides (see
Supplementary Fig. 1). In vivo binding of MYC to the
WRN promoter was documented by use of a chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay (Frank et al. 2001).
Comparable results demonstrating increased WRN A
and B site binding by MYC were obtained in four different cell lines expressing deregulated c-myc (Fig. 2B). In
vivo binding of MYC to the WRN promoter and a modest
but consistent elevation in histone H4 acetylation, as
observed for other MYC-target genes (Frank et al. 2001),
was also shown by duplex PCR in the B-cell line P-493-6
that expresses a Tet-Myc-repressible gene (Fig. 2C).
These results and the tight transcriptional correlation of
WRN and c-myc indicate that WRN is a direct transcriptional target of the MYC oncoprotein.
MYC overexpression in the absence of WRN promotes
cell senescence
To determine whether the proliferation and survival of
cells lacking WRN were altered upon MYC overexpression, we compared the proliferative effects of c-myc
overexpression in normal and in two different WRN syndrome fibroblasts (WRN−/− strains AG03141 and
AG00780) that had been immortalized by hTERT as previously described (Hirata et al. 2002). A brief burst of cell
proliferation was observed 48 h following retroviral
transduction of c-myc in all cell strains. However,
within 2–3 passages, ∼30%–70% of the WRN−/− cells expressed senescence-associated (SA-) ␤-galactosidase
(␤-gal; Fig. 3A) and lost proliferative capacity (Fig. 3B).
The senescent phenotype in c-myc-transduced WRN−/−
cells was also confirmed at the gene expression level by
microarray analysis, which demonstrated elevated expression of several genes characteristic of replicative senescence, such as the matrix proteases (Shelton et al.
1999; see Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, only a
small percentage of the hTERT+ WRN−/− cells transduced with a control retroviral vector expressed SA-␤-gal
(∼1%), similarly to hTERT-immortalized normal fibroblasts (hTERT+, from two independent donors) upon
MYC overexpression, (Figs. 3A, 4C). These results indi-

Werner gene induction by Myc prevents senescence

promoter. (A) Purified MYC–MAX heterodimers bind and retard the mobility of a WRN promoter fragment encompassing
nucleotides −412 to +8 in EMSAs. Where indicated, the A and B
sites were mutated (see Materials and Methods) to determine
the specificity of binding. In lane 2, 25 ng of MYC and 7.5 ng of
MAX were used; In lanes 3–5, 7, and 9, 12.5 ng of MYC and 3.75
ng of MAX were used. Controls include a specific competitor
oligonucleotide containing a MYC CACGTG consensus site
added at 1 pM (∼10-fold molar excess over the probe; +), as well
as a methylated CACGTG that is not recognized by MYC (*).
(B) ChIP detects MYC binding to WRN promoter elements in
vivo. Cross-linked chromatin from Raji, U937 and HL60 cell
lines, and the EBV-immortalized P-493-6 cell expressing a Tetmyc was immunoprecipitated with protein A only (prA) or with
anti-MYC antibodies. Bound DNA was monitored by real-time
PCR with WRN promoter-specific primers. Two negative controls were used as nontarget E-box-containing genes (see Materials and Methods). The percent of total DNA bound was calculated as described (Frank et al. 2001). (C) MYC induction

anti-MYC or anti-acetylated H4 (acH4; Upstate Biotechnology)
antibodies or with rabbit preimmune serum. Bound DNA was
quantified by duplex PCR using primers flanking site B of the
WRN promoter and the ␤-globin gene as internal control (Schubeler et al. 2000). The right panel shows the quantitation of the
ratio of WRN promoter to ␤-globin. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.

cate that WRN counteracts senescence in the presence of
elevated MYC.
To better characterize the senescent phenotype of
WRN−/−, hTERT+ cells following MYC overexpression,
we examined the cell-cycle distribution, the expression
of cell-cycle regulatory proteins, and the apoptotic response of transduced cells. WRN−/− cells that were senescent by virtue of MYC overexpression were largely
G1-arrested with a small G2 fraction (data not shown).
c-myc overexpression induced p53 and its target gene
p21Cip (Brown et al. 1997), as well as p16ink4A (Alcorta et
al. 1996), the major inhibitor of Rb phosphorylation, in
WRN−/− and control cells (Fig. 3C). No significant difference in the magnitude of these responses was observed,
with the exception of the predicted higher levels of WRN
protein in control cells transduced with a c-myc-containing retrovirus (Fig. 3C). ARF, a prominent response to
elevated MYC in rodent cells, was not significantly induced by MYC (Fig. 3D), whereas hTERT expression, as
expected, was consistently elevated in all cells (Fig. 3E).
The limited proliferation of WRN−/− cells following cmyc transduction might reflect increased apoptosis.
However, we did not detect appreciable cell death early
after infection or during later passages, by FACS or by
TUNEL assay (data not shown).

Depletion of WRN protein in normal hTERT+
fibroblasts by RNA interference (RNAi)
The results above suggest that the coordinate up-regulation of WRN by MYC may be important to insure MYCdriven cell proliferation by attenuating the nonspecific
suppressive effect of cell senescence. To determine
whether the senescent phenotype of WRN−/− fibroblasts
results directly from the loss of WRN, we examined the
effects of MYC overexpression in normal hTERT+ fibroblasts following the acute depletion of WRN by RNAi.
Initial experiments indicated that WRN protein could be
almost completely depleted from WRN+ hTERT+ fibroblasts after transduction with a retroviral vector (pBHsiWRN) expressing a short hairpin silencing RNA specific for the WRN gene and 2 d of antibiotic selection
(Fig. 4A). WRN protein could be detected at later time
points, so we simultaneously transduced cells with pBHsiWRN and a retrovirus expressing MYC (pB-MYC) or an
empty virus (pB). Hygromycin selection was used to recover cells that expressed siWRN. WRN was again undetectable after 3 d of selection in hygromycin, whereas
MYC was overexpressed (Fig. 4B). WRN-depleted cells
proliferated poorly compared to empty vector or cells
expressing a control RNAi (sip53; data not shown). MYC

Conclusions
The results detailed above indicate that WRN is able to
modulate cell proliferation and senescence upon MYC
overexpression in human hTERT+ fibroblasts. A model
to explain this interdependence of MYC and WRN is
shown in Figure 5: MYC overexpression can promote
cell growth and proliferation, as well as genomic instability (Felsher and Bishop 1999; Soucek and Evan 2002;
Vafa et al. 2002). WRN suppresses genomic instability
and insures cell survival after DNA damage by virtue of
its role(s) in DNA recombination and repair (Prince et al.
2001; Brosh and Bohr 2002; Saintigny et al. 2002). Cells
lacking WRN function display increased genetic instability and have limited growth potential. These defects
can in part be compensated for by the re-expression of
telomerase activity (Wyllie et al. 2000; Choi et al. 2001).
However, hTERT+ cells lacking WRN cannot overcome
the additional demands imposed by MYC-driven proliferation, and thus exhibit impaired cell proliferation and
enter senescence.
One prediction of this model is that WRN patients
should not be susceptible to tumors such as Burkitt or
diffuse large B-cell lymphomas or to breast or prostate
carcinomas, where MYC overexpression is commonly
observed (Nesbit et al. 1999). This is indeed the case: the
most common neoplasms observed in WRN patients are
thyroid carcinomas, osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and meningiomas, and the leukemias and lymphomas that are observed in WRN patients are largely of

control normal fibroblasts were transduced with LmycSN or

with LmycSN showed morphological changes typical of senescent cells after 2–3 passages, and expressed SA-␤-gal activity.

p16ink4A (Pharmingen no. 13251A) in all cell types. WRN (BD
Transduction Laboratories no. 611168) is undetectable in the
WRN−/− lines as reported (Moser et al. 2000), but induced by
MYC in control cells. (D) ARF mRNA expression in WRN−/−
and control hTERT+ fibroblasts was analyzed by Northern blot
using an INK4a exon 1-specific probe. max was used as loading
control. (E) hTERT mRNA expression at passage 3 was quantitated by RT–PCR primers, and the ribosomal protein 36B4 was
used as a control. HeLa and primary human foreskin fibroblasts
(HFF) cDNAs were used as controls. The apparently higher levels of ARF mRNA in control cultures are due to RNA loading
differences.

overexpression failed to rescue the proliferative capacity
of WRN-depleted cells and led to a significant increase in
the percentage of SA-␤-gal-positive cells (Fig. 4C,D).

Werner gene induction by Myc prevents senescence

Figure 5. Role of WRN induction in MYC-driven tumorigenesis. WRN appears to suppress genomic instability and cellular
senescence by insuring the error-free repair of DNA following
damage or replication arrest. MYC overexpression promotes tumorigenesis by influencing cell growth, cell proliferation (for
review, see Grandori et al. 2000), and genomic instability
(Felsher and Bishop 1999; Vafa et al. 2002). MYC induction of
WRN and hTERT (Wang et al. 1998a; Wu et al. 1999) may further promote tumorigenesis by suppressing cellular senescence
while insuring a high probability of continued cell division.

histopathologic subtypes other than those associated
with MYC abnormalities (Goto et al. 1996). It should
also be possible to further define the functional interdependence of MYC and WRN in transgenic systems, such
as Eµ-c-myc mice (Adams et al. 1985), which rapidly develop MYC-dependent B-cell lymphomas. The model in
Figure 5 predicts that lymphoma development in these
mice will be suppressed by cellular senescence in the
absence of WRN (Lebel and Leder 1998; Lombard et al.
2000). This new link between MYC and WRN may also
identify new opportunities for the treatment of MYCoverexpressing human tumors.
Materials and methods
Electromobility gel shift assays (EMSAs)
EMSAs were performed with bacterially expressed C92-MYC and with
full-length MAX as described (Wu et al. 1999). Approximately 3 ng of a
32
-P-labeled WRN promoter fragment (nucleotides −412 to +8; GenBank
accession no. AB003173; Wang et al. 1998b; Yamabe et al. 1998) was used
with different amounts of purified MYC–MAX protein. Where specified,
the WRN promoter A and B sites were mutated to CGCCTG or
CATTCT, respectively. MYC–MAX–DNA complexes were resolved on
4% polyacrylamide-HEPES gels prior to PhosphorImager quantitation.
Chromatin cross-linking and immunoprecipitations (ChIP assay)
The detailed ChIP protocol and quantification has been described (Frank
et al. 2001). For additional details, see Supplemental Materials and Methods. In the experiment shown in Figure 2C, cross-linked chromatin from
P-493-6 cells expressing Tet-myc gene (−Tet; MYC on) or from cells exposed to tetracycline for 48 h (+Tet; MYC off) was prepared as described
(Schubeler et al. 2000). Identical chromatin fractions were precipitated
with anti-MYC, anti-acetylated H4 (acH4; Upstate Biotechnology), or
rabbit preimmune serum. Bound DNA was quantified by duplex PCR
using primers flanking site B of the WRN promoter and the ␤-globin gene
as internal control as described (Schubeler et al. 2000).
Northern analyses and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT–PCR)
See Supplemental Materials and Methods.
Cell culture
Primary WRN fibroblast strains AG00780 and AG03141 (Coriell Cell
Repository) and normal primary human fibroblasts were immortalized by
infection with a human hTERT-expressing retrovirus, MLV-LTSP (Hirata
et al. 2002). Polyclonal populations of cells were then transduced with
the MYC expressing LmycSN retrovirus or the control retrovirus LXSN
(Miller and Rosman 1989) prior to selection in G418 (700 µg/mL). G418resistant cells were plated at the same density for proliferation assays and
for counting at each passage. Cell staining for the senescent marker SA␤-gal activity was performed as described (Dimri et al. 1995). For the
experiments shown in Figure 4, hTERT+ fibroblasts obtained with MLV-

LTSP or LXSN expressing hTERT were simultaneously infected with
pBH silencing vectors (see below) and pBabe-MYC or empty vector,
pBabe (Morgenstern and Land 1990). After 3 d in hygromycin, cells were
replated at 0.5 × 105 − 105 in 10-cm plates and stained for SA-␤-gal within
6–9 d.
U937, Raji, HL60, and P-493-6 cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). For the P-493-6 cells
ChIP assay, 2 L of exponentially growing cells were diluted to 3 × 105
cells/mL, and 0.1 µg/mL tetracycline was added 72 h prior to harvest. To
induce expression of Tet-myc, P-493-6 cells were washed 3 times in
warm RPMI medium containing 10% FCS in order to remove tetracycline before culturing, as indicated in Figure 2B.
RNAi depletion
A modified pBabeHygro retroviral vector (pBH) was constructed to stably
express siRNAs in primary fibroblasts. An expression cassette containing
the human H1 promoter followed by gene-specific short hairpin sequences (as described by Brummelkamp et al. 2002) was inserted into the
unique NheI site in the downstream U3 region of the pBH backbone to
create pBH-siWRN. The anti-WRN hairpin corresponds to human WRN
cDNA bps 391–415 (GenBank accession no. L76937). This WRN region
does not share significant homology with the other human RecQ helicases or to other expressed genes. pBH-sip53 contains a similar H1siRNA cassette containing an anti-p53 hairpin (Brummelkamp et al.
2002). An empty pBH vector and pBH-siGFP, expressing a siRNA against
green fluorescent protein, were used as negative controls.
