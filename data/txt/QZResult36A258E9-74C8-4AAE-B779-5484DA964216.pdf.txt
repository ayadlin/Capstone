Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is a master regulator of protein synthesis that
couples nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancer. However, the downstream translationally
regulated nodes of gene expression that may direct cancer development are poorly characterized.
Using ribosome profiling, we uncover specialized translation of the prostate cancer genome by
oncogenic mTOR signalling, revealing a remarkably specific repertoire of genes involved in cell
proliferation, metabolism and invasion. We extend these findings by functionally characterizing a
class of translationally controlled pro-invasion messenger RNAs that we show direct prostate
cancer invasion and metastasis downstream of oncogenic mTOR signalling. Furthermore, we
develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene
expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is
presently no cure. Together, these findings extend our understanding of how the ‘cancerous’

It is unknown whether specialized networks of translationally controlled mRNAs can direct
cancer initiation and progression, thereby mirroring cooperativity that has mainly been
observed at the level of transcriptional control. This is an important question, as key
oncogenic signalling molecules, such as the mTOR kinase, directly regulate the activity of
general translation factors1,2. Downstream of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase
(PI(3)K)–AKT signalling pathway, mTOR assembles with either raptor or rictor to form two
distinct complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2 (refs 3, 4). The major regulators of protein
synthesis downstream of mTORC1 are 4EBP1 (also called EIF4EBP1) and p70S6K1/2 (refs
1, 2). 4EBP1 negatively regulates eIF4E, a key rate-limiting initiation factor for capdependent translation. Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTORC1 leads to its dissociation from
eIF4E, allowing translation initiation complex formation at the 5′ end of mRNAs5. The
mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of p70S6K1/2 also promotes translation initiation as well
as elongation6. At a genome-wide level, it remains poorly understood whether and how
activation of these regulators of protein synthesis may produce specific changes in gene
expression networks that direct cancer development. Here we use a powerful new
technology known as ribosome profiling to delineate the translational landscape of the
cancer genome at a codon-by-codon resolution upon pharmacological inhibition of mTOR7.
Our findings provide genome-wide characterization of translationally controlled mRNAs
downstream of oncogenic mTOR signalling and delineate their functional roles in cancer
development. Moreover, we determine the efficacy of a novel clinically relevant mTOR
inhibitor that we developed, INK128, which specifically targets this cancer program.

Ribosome profiling of the prostate cancer genome

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

mTOR is deregulated in nearly 100% of advanced human prostate cancers8, and genetic
findings in mouse models implicate mTOR hyperactivation in prostate cancer initiation9–11.
Given the critical role for mTOR in prostate cancer, we used PC3 human prostate cancer
cells, where mTOR is constitutively hyperactivated, to delineate translationally controlled
gene expression networks upon complete or partial mTOR inhibition. We optimized
ribosome profiling to assess quantitatively ribosome occupancy genome-wide in cancer
cells7. In brief, ribosome-protected mRNA fragments were deep-sequenced to determine the
number of ribosomes engaged in translating specific mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 1a and
Methods). Treatment of PC3 cells with PP242 (refs 12, 13), an mTOR ATP site inhibitor,
significantly inhibits the activity of the three primary downstream mTOR effectors 4EBP1,
p70S6K1/2 and AKT. On the contrary, rapamycin, an allosteric mTOR inhibitor, only
blocks p70S6K1/2 activity in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We used short 3-h drug
treatments, which precede alterations in de novo protein synthesis, to capture direct changes
in mTOR-dependent gene expression by ribosome profiling and to minimize compensatory
feedback mechanisms (Supplementary Fig. 1c–f).
Ribosome profiling revealed 144 target mRNAs selectively decreased at the translational
level upon PP242 treatment (log2 ≤–1.5 (false discovery rate <0.05)) compared to rapamycin
treatment, with limited changes in transcription (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Figs 2a, b and
3–10). The fact that at this time point rapamycin treatment did not markedly affect gene
expression is consistent with incomplete allosteric inhibition of mTOR activity
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). By monitoring footprints of translating 80S ribosomes, our
findings show that the effects of PP242 are largely at the level of translation initiation and
not elongation (Supplementary Fig. 3). It has been proposed that mRNAs translationally
regulated by mTOR may contain long 5′ untranslated regions (5′ UTRs) with complex
RNA secondary structures. On the contrary, ribosome profiling revealed that mTORNature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 May 24.

responsive 5′ UTRs possess less complex features (Fig. 1b–d), providing a unique data set
to investigate the nature of regulatory elements that render these mRNAs mTOR-sensitive. It
has been previously shown that some mTOR translationally regulated mRNAs, most notably
those involved in protein synthesis, possess a 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5′
TOP)14,15 that is regulated by distinct transacting factors16,17. Of the 144 mTOR-sensitive
target genes, 68% possess a 5′ TOP. However, as the 5′ TOP is not present in all mTORsensitive mRNAs, we next asked whether other 5′ UTR consensus sequences may exist.
Strikingly, 63% of mTOR target mRNAs possess what we have termed a pyrimidine-rich
translational element (PRTE) within their 5′ UTRs (P = 3.2 × 10–11). This element, unlike
the 5′ TOP sequence, consists of an invariant uridine at position 6 flanked by pyrimidines
and, importantly, does not reside at position +1 of the 5′ UTR (Supplementary Figs 2c and
7). We found that 89% of the mTOR-responsive genes possess a PRTE and/or 5′ TOP,
making the presence of one or both sequences a strong predictor for mTOR sensitivity
(Supplementary Figs 2d and 7). Notably, mRNA isoforms arising from distinct transcription
start sites may possess both a 5′ TOP and a PRTE. Moreover, given the significant number
of mRNAs that contain both the PRTE and 5′ TOP, a functional interplay may exist
between these regulatory elements. Future studies are required to determine the regulatory
logic for how these sequences either independently or coordinately confer mTOR
responsiveness. Multiple cis-acting elements within specific 5′ UTRs could reflect
regulation by distinct mTOR effectors. For example, our findings show that the PRTE
imparts translational control specificity to 4EBP1 activity (see below).
Surprisingly, mTOR-sensitive genes stratify into unique functional categories that may
promote cancer development and progression, including cellular invasion (P = 0.009), cell
proliferation (P = 0.04), metabolism (P = 0.0002) and regulators of protein modification (P =
0.01) (Fig. 1e). The largest fraction of mTOR-responsive mRNAs cluster into a node
consisting of key components of the translational apparatus: 70 ribosomal proteins, 6
elongation factors, and 4 translation initiation factors (P = 7.5 × 10–82) (Fig. 1e and
Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, this class of mTOR-responsive mRNAs may represent an
important regulon that sustains the elevated protein synthetic capacity of cancer cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Notably, the second largest node of mTOR translationally regulated genes comprises bona
fide cell invasion and metastasis mRNAs and putative regulators of this process (Fig. 1e).
This group includes YB1 (Y-box binding protein 1; also called YBX1), vimentin, MTA1
(metastasis associated 1) and CD44 (Supplementary Fig. 11a). YB1 regulates the posttranscriptional expression of a network of invasion genes18. Vimentin, an intermediate
filament protein, is highly upregulated during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
associated with cellular invasion19. MTA1, a putative chromatin-remodelling protein, is
overexpressed in invasive human prostate cancer20 and has been shown to drive cancer
metastasis by promoting neoangiogenesis21. CD44 is commonly overexpressed in tumourinitiating cells and is implicated in prostate cancer metastasis22. Consistent with their status
as mTOR sensitive genes, YB1, vimentin, MTA1 and CD44 all possess a PRTE
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Vimentin and CD44 also possess a 5′ TOP (Supplementary Fig. 7).
To test the functional role of the PRTE in mediating translational control, we mutated the
PRTE within the 5′ UTR of YB1, which rendered the YB1 5′ UTR insensitive to inhibition
by 4EBP1 (Supplementary Fig. 11b). These findings highlight a novel cis-regulatory
element that may modulate translational control of subsets of mRNAs upon mTOR
activation. Moreover, ribosome profiling reveals unexpected transcript-specific translational
control, mediated by oncogenic mTOR signalling, including a distinct set of pro-invasion
and metastasis genes.

Translation of pro-invasion mRNAs by mTOR
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next extended the use of the mTOR pharmacological tools used in ribosome profiling
towards functional characterization of the newly identified mTOR-sensitive cell invasion
gene signature. To this end, we developed a new clinical-grade mTOR ATP site inhibitor,
INK128, derived from the PP242 chemical scaffold (Fig. 1f). In brief, a structure-guided
optimization of pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives was performed (see INK128 chemical
synthesis in Supplementary Information) that improved oral bioavailability while retaining
mTOR kinase potency and selectivity. INK128 was selected for clinical studies on the basis
of its high potency (1.4 nM inhibition constant (Ki)), selectivity for mTOR, low molecular
mass, and favourable pharmaceutical properties (Supplementary Figs 12 and 13).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Using either PP242 or INK128, we observed a selective decrease in the expression of YB1,
MTA1, vimentin and CD44 at the protein but not transcript level in PC3 cells starting at 6 h
of treatment, which precedes any decrease in de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1g and
Supplementary Figs 1c, d, 14 and 15). In contrast, rapamycin treatment did not alter their
expression (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 14a). Similar findings were observed using a
broad panel of metastatic cell lines of distinct histological origins (Supplementary Fig. 16).
The four-gene invasion signature is positively regulated by mTOR hyperactivation, as
silencing PTEN expression increased their protein but not mRNA expression levels
(Supplementary Fig. 17). We next investigated the effects of mTOR ATP site inhibitors on
prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. We found that INK128, but not rapamycin,
decreases the invasive potential of PC3 prostate cancer cells (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, INK128
inhibits cancer cell migration starting at 6 h of treatment, precisely correlating with when
decreases in the expression of pro-invasion genes are evident, but preceding any changes in
the cell cycle or overall global protein synthesis (Fig. 2b, c, and Supplementary Figs 1c, e, f,
14b and 18).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Among the genes comprising the pro-invasion signature, YB1 has been shown to act directly
as a translation factor that controls expression of a larger set of genes involved in breast
cancer cell invasion18. Notably, YB1 translationally regulated target mRNAs, including
SNAIL1 (also called SNAI), LEF1 and TWIST1, decreased at the protein but not transcript
level upon YB1 knockdown in PC3 cells (Supplementary Figs 19 and 20). To determine the
functional role of YB1 in prostate cancer cell invasion, we silenced YB1 gene expression in
PC3 cells, and observed a 50% reduction in cell invasion (Fig. 2d). Similarly, knockdown of
MTA1, CD44, or vimentin also inhibited prostate cancer cell invasion (Fig. 2d and
Supplementary Fig. 19). These mTOR target mRNAs may be sufficient to endow primary
prostate cells with invasive features, as overexpression of YB1 and/or MTA1
(Supplementary Fig. 21a) in BPH-1 cells, an untransformed prostate epithelial cell line,
increased the invasive capacity of these cells in an additive manner (Fig. 2e). Notably, the
effects of YB1 and MTA1 on cell invasion are independent from any effect on cell
proliferation in both knockdown or overexpression studies (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c).
Therefore, translational control of pro-invasion mRNAs by oncogenic mTOR signalling
alters the ability of epithelial cells to migrate and invade, a key feature of cancer metastasis.

Dissecting mTOR translational effectors
We sought to determine the molecular mechanism by which pro-invasion genes are
regulated at the translational level and why these mRNAs are sensitive to INK128 but not
rapamycin. To this end, we investigated whether the translational regulators downstream
mTORC1, 4EBP1 and/or p70S6K1/2, control the expression of these mTOR-sensitive
targets. We generated a human prostate cancer cell line that stably expresses a doxycyclineinducible dominant-negative mutant of 4EBP1 (4EBP1M) (Fig. 3a)13. This mutant binds to

eIF4E, decreasing its hyperactivation without inhibiting general mTORC1 function
(Supplementary Fig. 22a). Notably, expression of 4EBP1M does not alter global protein
synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 22b), probably because endogenous 4EBP1 and 4EBP2
proteins retain their ability to bind to eIF4E (Supplementary Fig. 22c)13. Upon induction of
4EBP1M, YB1, vimentin, CD44 and MTA1 decrease at the protein but not mRNA level,
whereas pharmacological inhibition of p70S6K1/2 with DG-2 (ref. 23) had no effect (Fig.
3b,c and Supplementary Fig. 22d). Next, we tested whether INK128 decreases expression of
the four invasion genes through the 4EBP–eIF4E axis. Notably, knockdown of 4EBP1 and
4EBP2 in PC3 cells or using 4EBP1 and 4EBP2 double knockout mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs)24 reduced the ability of INK128 to decrease expression of these proinvasion mRNAs (Fig. 3d, e and Supplementary Fig. 23). Furthermore, ablation of mTORC2
activity25 had no effect on the expression of these mRNAs or responsiveness to INK128
(Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 24a–c). Next, we determined the effect of 4EBP1M on
human prostate cancer cell invasion. The expression of 4EBP1M resulted in a significant
decrease in prostate cancer cell invasion without affecting the cell cycle, whereas DG-2 had
no effect (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 24d). These findings demonstrate that eIF4E
hyperactivation downstream of oncogenic mTOR regulates translational control of the proinvasion mRNAs and provides an explanation for the selective targeting of this gene
signature by mTOR ATP site inhibitors.

Examining cell invasion networks in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Both CK5+ and CK8+ prostate epithelial cells have been implicated in the initiation of
prostate cancer upon loss of PTEN26,27. Ptenloxp/loxp;Pb-cre (PtenL/L) mice are an ideal
model of prostate cancer because they display distinct stages of cancer development
(prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive adenocarcinoma, and metastasis)28. However,
the expression patterns of YB1, vimentin, CD44 and MTA1 in prostate basal (CK5+) and
luminal (CK8+) epithelial cells have not been characterized. We therefore analysed their
expression patterns in the PtenL/L prostate cancer mouse model, where mTOR is
constitutively hyperactivated9,28. We found that YB1 localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus
of CK5+ and CK8+ prostate epithelial cells, consistent with its ability to shuttle between the
two cellular compartments (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 25a, b)18,29. MTA1
expression is exclusively nuclear in both cell types (Fig. 4c, d). Of note, CD44, together
with other cell-surface markers, has been used to isolate a rare prostate stem-cell
population30. We observed expression of CD44 within a subset of CK5+ and CK8+
epithelial cells (Fig. 4e, f). In contrast, vimentin is not detected in either cell type (Fig. 4g).
We next determined the impact of mTOR hyperactivation on the expression pattern of the
pro-invasion gene signature. YB1, MTA1 and CD44 protein, but not transcript, levels were
significantly increased in both PtenL/L luminal and basal epithelial cells compared to wild
type (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 25c–e). Interestingly, a subset of PtenL/L luminal
epithelial cells ectopically expresses vimentin at aberrantly high levels, with a perinuclear
distribution (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 25f, g) suggesting that these cells may have
acquired some mesenchymal-like features. Consistent with these findings, perinuclear
vimentin localization is associated with invasive features of human prostate cancer cells31
and changes in cell polarity in actively moving fibroblasts32. These studies reveal a unique,
translationally controlled signature of gene expression downstream of mTOR
hyperactivation in a cancer-initiating subset of prostate epithelial cells.

Targeting prostate cancer metastasis
The most significant pre-clinical extension of this work would be to determine the
therapeutic benefit of INK128 in reprogramming expression of the mTOR-dependent proinvasion gene signature and prostate cancer metastasis directly in vivo. This is underscored

by the clinical inefficacy of allosteric mTOR inhibition towards the lethal form of metastatic
human prostate cancer33,34. Importantly, in our preclinical trial of RAD001 (rapalog) versus
INK128 in PtenL/L mice, 4EBP1 and p70S6K1/2 phosphorylation was completely restored
to wild-type levels after treatment with INK128, whereas RAD001 only decreased
p70S6K1/2 phosphorylation levels (Supplementary Fig. 26a, b). We next determined the
cellular consequences of complete versus partial mTOR inhibition during distinct stages of
prostate cancer. INK128 treatment resulted in a 50% decrease in prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN) lesions in PtenL/L mice that was associated with decreased proliferation and
a tenfold increase in apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 26d–f). Notably, the unique cytotoxic
properties of INK128 treatment in PtenL/L mice were evidenced by a marked reduction in
prostate cancer volume. In addition, and consistent with these findings, INK128 induced
programmed cell death in multiple cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 27a, b). In contrast,
RAD001 treatment mainly had cytostatic effects leading to only partial regression of PIN
lesions associated with a limited decrease in cell proliferation and no significant effect on
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 26c–f).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We extended the preclinical trial by examining the effects of INK128 treatment on the proinvasion gene signature and prostate cancer metastasis, which is incurable and the primary
cause of patient mortality. Cell invasion is the critical first step in metastasis, required for
systemic dissemination. In PtenL/L mice after the onset of PIN, a subset of prostate glands
show characteristics of luminal epithelial cell invasion by 12 months (Fig. 5a and
Supplementary Fig. 27c)28. After 12 months of age, PtenL/L mice develop lymph-node
metastases and these cells maintain strong YB1 and MTA1 expression (Fig. 5b). We further
extended these findings directly to human prostate cancer patient specimens, observing that
YB1 expression levels increase in a stepwise fashion from normal prostate to castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an advanced form of the disease associated with increased
metastatic potential (Fig. 5c). MTA1 levels exhibit similar increases20. In human prostate
cancer, high-grade primary tumours that display invasive features are more likely to develop
systemic metastasis than low-grade non-invasive tumours35,36. Remarkably, treatment with
INK128 completely blocked the progression of invasive prostate cancer locally in the
prostate gland, and profoundly inhibited the total number and size of distant metastases (Fig.
5d–f). This was associated with a marked decrease in the expression of YB1, vimentin,
CD44 and MTA1 at the protein, but not transcript, level in specific epithelial cell types
within pre-invasive PIN lesions in PtenL/L mice (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 25c).
Together, these findings reveal an unexpected role for oncogenic mTOR signalling in
control of a pro-invasion translational program that, along with the lethal metastatic form of
prostate cancer, can be efficiently targeted with clinically relevant mTOR ATP site
inhibitors.

Discussion
Here we used ribosome profiling to generate a comprehensive map of translationally
controlled mTOR targets in cancer that surprisingly stratify into specific cellular processes
including proliferation, metabolism, protein synthesis and invasion (Fig. 1e). The effects of
this translational control program are probably broad, converging on many subclasses of
mRNAs that may cooperate towards distinct steps in cancer development and therapeutic
response. This is supported by our in vivo findings where we developed a novel clinically
relevant mTOR inhibitor, INK128, that significantly abrogates multiple aspects of prostate
cancer development by inducing apoptosis as well as inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion
and metastasis (Fig. 5d–g and Supplementary Fig. 26c–f). The superiority of INK128 as an
mTOR inhibitor is also evident in its ability to reprogram the mTOR oncogenic translational
program in prostate cancer, which is not achieved by rapalog treatment. Of note, however,
the sensitivity of cells from distinct histological origins to ATP site versus allosteric

inhibitors of mTOR may differ. For example, the Jurkat lymphoid cell line is particularly
sensitive to rapamycin treatment37.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

One of the most novel nodes of mTOR translationally controlled genes are those that
cooperatively control, at least in part, the cellular invasive features of human prostate cancer
cells (Figs 1g, 2 and 3b, g). Translational control of these mRNAs relies on the 4EBP1–
eIF4E axis and is thereby specifically druggable with potent mTOR ATP site inhibitors,
which, unlike rapamycin, target mTOR-dependent 4EBP1 phosphorylation (Figs 1g, 3d, e
and 5g, and Supplementary Figs 1b, 23 and 26b). This has significant therapeutic
implications not only for advanced prostate cancer but also for multiple metastatic cancers
where we show that translational control of pro-invasion mRNAs is sensitive to ATP site
inhibitors of mTOR (Supplementary Fig. 16). Thereby, these studies link translational
regulation to the poorly understood mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis. Intriguingly,
various components of the translation machinery, including oncogenic eIF4E38, localize to
the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts39. This may allow spatially controlled translation
of mRNAs important for cell migration, providing a rapid and specific response in
transducing a migration program that could be co-opted at the invasive edge of metastatic
cancer cells. Together, these studies reveal that the ability of mTOR to phosphorylate
general translation factors results in exquisite transcript-specific translational control of key
mRNAs that may cooperate in distinct steps of cancer initiation and progression, with
significant implications for therapeutic intervention.

pcDNA3-HA-YB1 was provided by V. Evdokimova. pCMV6-Myk-DDK-MTA1 was
purchased from Origene. pGL3-Promoter was purchased from Promega. To clone the 5′
UTR of YB1 into pGL3-Promoter, the entire 5′ UTR sequence of YB1 was amplified from
PC3 cDNA. PCR fragments were digested with HindIII and NcoI and ligated into the
corresponding sites of pGL3-Promoter. The PRTE sequence at position +20–34 in the YB1

Mutagenesis Kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene).
Ribosome profiling
PC3 cells were treated with rapamycin (50 nM; Calbiochem) or PP242 (2.5 μM; Intellikine)
for 3 h. Cells were subsequently treated with cycloheximide (100 μg ml–1; Sigma) and
detergent lysis was performed in the dish. The lysate was treated with DNase and clarified,
and a sample was taken for RNA-seq analysis. Lysates were subjected to ribosome foot
printing by nuclease treatment. Ribosome-protected fragments were purified, and deep
sequencing libraries were generated from these fragments, as well as from poly(A) mRNA
purified from non-nuclease-treated lysates. These libraries were analysed by sequencing on
an Illumina GAII.

Each sequencing run resulted in approximately 20–25 million raw reads per sample, of
which 5–12 million unique reads were used for subsequent analysis. Ribosome footprint and
RNA-seq sequencing reads were aligned against a library of transcripts from the UCSC
Known Genes database GRCh37/hg19. The first 25 nucleotides of each read were aligned
using Bowtie and this initial alignment was then extended to encompass the full fragmentderived portion of the sequencing read while excluding the linker sequence. Read density
profiles were then constructed for the canonical transcript of each gene, using only reads
with 0 or 1 total mismatches between the read sequence and the reference sequence,
comprised of the transcript fragment followed by the linker sequence. Footprint reads were
assigned to an A site nucleotide at position +15 to +17 of the alignment, based on the total
fragment length; mRNA reads were assigned to the first nucleotide of the alignment. The
average read density per codon was then computed for the coding sequence of each
transcript, excluding the first 15 and last 5 codons, which can display atypical ribosome
accumulation.

Average read density was used as a measure of mRNA abundance (RNA-seq reads) and of
protein synthesis (ribosome profiling reads). For most analyses, genes were filtered to
require at least 256 reads in the relevant RNA-seq samples. Translational efficiency was
computed as the ratio of ribosome footprint read density to RNA-seq read density, scaled to
normalize the translational efficiency of the median gene to 1.0 after excluding regulated
genes (log2 fold-change ±1.5 after normalizing for the all-gene median). Changes in protein
synthesis, mRNA abundance and translational efficiency were similarly computed as the
ratio of read densities between different samples, normalized to give the median gene a ratio
of 1.0. This normalization corrects for differences in the absolute number of sequencing
reads obtained for different libraries. 3,977 (replicate 1), and 5,333 (replicate 2) unique
mRNAs passed a preset read threshold of 256 reads for single-gene quantification for all
treatment conditions.
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as previously described13 with antibodies specific to
phospho-AKTS473 (Cell Signaling), AKT (Cell Signaling), phospho-p70S6KT389 (Cell
Signaling), phospho-rpS6S240/244 (Cell Signaling), rpS6 (Cell Signaling),

qPCR analysis
RNA was isolated using the manufacturer's protocol for RNA extraction with TRIzol
Reagent (Invitrogen) using the Pure Link RNA mini kit (Invitrogen). RNA was Dnasetreated with Pure Link Dnase (Invitrogen). Dnase-treated RNA was transcribed to cDNA
with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT–PCR (Invitrogen), and 1 μl of
cDNA was used to run a SYBR green detection qPCR assay (SYBR Green Supermix and
MyiQ2, Biorad). Primers were used at 200 nM.
5′ UTR analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

5′ UTRs of the 144 downregulated mTOR target genes were obtained using the known gene
ID from the UCSC Genome Browser (GRCh37/hg19). Target versus non-target mRNAs
were compared for 5′ UTR length, %G+C content and Gibbs free energy by the Wilcoxon
two-sided test. Multiple Em (expectation maximization) for Motif Elicitation (MEME) and
Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO) was used to derive the PRTE and determine its
enrichment in the 144 mTOR-sensitive genes compared a background list of 3,000 genes.
The Database of Transcriptional Start Sites (DBTSS Release 8.0) was used to identify
putative 5′ TOP genes and putative transcription start sites in the 144 mTOR target genes.
Luciferase assay
PC3 4EBP1M cells were treated with 1 μg ml–1 doxycycline (Sigma) for 24 h. Cells were
transfected with various pGL3-Promoter constructs using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
After 24 h, cells were collected. 20% of the cells were aliquoted for RNA isolation. The
remaining cells were used for the luciferase assay per the manufacturer's protocol
(Promega). Samples were measured for luciferase activity on a Glomax 96-well plate
luminometer (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to luciferase mRNA
expression levels.
Kinase assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

mTOR activity was assayed using LanthaScreen Kinase kit reagents (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. PI(3)K α, β, γ and δ activity were assayed using the PI(3)K
HTRF assay kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of
INK128 necessary to achieve inhibition of enzyme activity by 50% (IC50) was calculated
using concentrations ranging from 20 μM to 0.1 nM (12-point curve). IC50 values were
determined using a nonlinear regression model (GraphPad Prism 5).
Cell proliferation assay
PC3 cells were treated with the appropriate drug for 48 h, and proliferation was measured
usingCellTiter-Glo Luminescent reagent (Promega) per the manufacturer's protocol. The
concentration of INK128 necessary to achieve inhibition of cell growth by 50% (IC50) was
calculated using concentrations ranging from 20.0 μM to 0.1 nM (12-point curve).
Mouse xenograft study
Nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right subscapular region with 5 × 106
MDA-MB-361 cells. After tumours reached a size of 150–200 mm3, mice were randomly
assigned into vehicle control or treatment groups. INK128 was formulated in 5%

Pharmacokinetic analysis
The area under the plasma drug concentration versus time curves, AUC(0–tlast) and
AUC(0–inf), were calculated from concentration data using the linear trapezoidal rule. The
terminal t1/2 in plasma was calculated from the elimination rate constant (lz), estimated as
the slope of the log-linear terminal portion of the plasma concentration versus time curve, by
linear regression analysis. The bioavailability (F) was calculated using F =
(AUC(0–last),poDi.v.)/(AUC(0–last),ivDp.o.)×100%, where Di.v. and Dp.o. are intravenous and
oral doses, respectively. Cmax was a highest drug concentration in plasma after oral
administration. Tmax was the time at which Cmax is observed after extravascular
administration of drug. Tlast was the last time point a quantifiable drug concentration can be
measured.
Metabolic stability assay

In vitro metabolic stability of INK128 was evaluated after incubation with liver microsomes
or liver S9 fractions from various species in the presence of NADPH. The half-life of
INK128 was estimated by log linear regression analysis.

CYP assay
INK128 inhibition of CYP450 isoforms in human liver microsomes was determined with
isoform-specific substrates at concentrations approximately equal to the concentration at
which the rate of the reaction is half-maximal (Km) for the individual isoforms: CYP1A2,
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Pharmaceutical property assays
The percentage of protein binding of INK128 was determined in mouse, rat, dog, monkey
and human plasma at CEREP. The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of INK128 on hERG
potassium channel was determined at CEREP. A Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames

Prostates and lymph nodeswere dissected frommicewithin 2 h of the indicated treatment and
fixed in 10% formalin overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were subsequently dehydrated in ethanol
(Sigma) at room temperature, mounted into paraffin blocks, and sectioned at 5 μm.
Specimens were de-paraffinized and rehydrated using CitriSolv (Fisher) followed by serial
ethanol washes. Antigen unmasking was performed on each section using Citrate pH 6
(Vector Labs) in a pressure cooker at 125 °C for 10–30 min. Sections were washed in
distilled water followed by TBS washes. The sections were then incubated in 5% goat
serum, 1% BSA in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. Various primary antibodies were used
including those specific for keratin 5 (Covance), cytokeratin 8 (Abcam and Covance), YB1
(Abcam), vimentin (Abcam), MTA1 (Cell signaling), CD44 (BD Pharmingen) and the
androgen receptor (Epitomics), which were diluted 1:50–1:500 in blocking solution and
incubated on sections overnight at 4 °C. Specimens were then washed in TBS and incubated
with the appropriate Alexa 488 and 594 labelled secondary (Invitrogen) at 1:500 for 2 h at
room temperature with the exception of YB1 which was incubated with biotinylated antirabbit secondary (Vector) followed by incubation with Alexa 594 labelled Streptavidin
(Invitrogen). A final set of washes in TBS was completed at room temperature followed by
mounting with DAPI Hardset Mounting Medium (Vector Lab). A Zeiss Spinning Disc
confocal (Zeiss, CSU-X1) was used to image the sections at 40×–100×. Individual prostate
