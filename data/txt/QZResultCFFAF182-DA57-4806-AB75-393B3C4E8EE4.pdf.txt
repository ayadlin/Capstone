BACKGROUND. It is unknown whether patients with nonleukemic myeloid sarcoma (MS) and those with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have similar responses
to anti-AML treatment. In the current study, the authors addressed this question
by matching MS patients with analogous AML patients and comparing their clinical outcomes.

METHODS. Twenty-three consecutive patients with MS and 1720 consecutive
patients with AML were identified who presented at The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1990 to 2004. All AML patients and 16 MS
patients received cytarabine plus idarubicin or fludarabine as induction remission therapy. Treated MS patients and AML patients were matched according to
cytogenetics, age, Zubrod performance status, and time of treatment. Event-free

survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses.

RESULTS. Complete response rates were 69% in patients with MS and 57% in
patients with AML (P 5 .45). The respective 2-year EFS and OS rates were 32%
and 18% (P 5 .08) and 43% and 29% (P 5 .11). Matches were identified for 14 MS
patients who were paired repeatedly with 91 AML patients to produce 94
matches (3 AML patients were matched twice). EFS was longer in 56 MS pair
mates, shorter in 26 pair mates, and similar in 12 pair mates (P 5 .01; Fisher
exact test). OS analyses yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS. Anti-AML therapy was highly effective in patients with nonleukemic MS. The results from this study emphasize the need to treat patients who
have nonleukemic MS with AML-type therapy. Cancer 2008;113:1370–8.  2008

he term myeloid sarcoma (MS) is used to define an extramedullary mass composed of cells of myeloid lineage. Other terms
used as synonyms for this process are chloroma, granulocytic sarcoma, myeloblastoma, and extramedullary myeloid cell tumor.1–4
The 2001 World Health Organization classification currently recommends the term MS for this disease.5 Patients with MS most often
have evidence of concurrent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involving blood and bone marrow or involving only bone marrow.
Patients also may have a history of AML and relapse after therapy.
Less commonly, myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myeloproliferative disease can transform to MS. Very rarely, patients present
with MS as an isolated mass with no evidence of AML after extensive workup.6 MS can be characterized by granulocytic, monoblastic,

or myelomonocytic differentiation and often is associated with distinctive cytogenetic and molecular
abnormalities.7
One option for patients who present in such a
fashion is anti-AML therapy, as though the patient
had typical AML.8 However, there is little information
comparing the effects of anti-AML treatment in
patients who have MS without AML in the bone marrow with the effects in patients who have typical
AML. In this report, we address this question by
matching MS patients with comparable AML patients
according to age, performance status, year of treatment, and, to the extent possible, cytogenetics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We searched The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center leukemia database from 1990 to 2004
for patients who met the following 3 criteria: pathologically confirmed extramedullary MS, <5% bone
marrow blasts, and no history of AML. Twenty-three
patients with MS were identified. In 22 of 23
patients, markers were assessed to prove myeloid lineage.6 In 1 patient, cytochemical studies were performed on touch imprints. In a second patient, a
histochemical study for chloroacetate esterase was
performed using histologic sections. In the remaining
20 patients, immunohistochemical analyses were
performed using fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections and, in some of the earlier patients, frozen tissue sections. In the group that was assessed
immunohistochemically, histochemical analyses for
chloroacetate esterase also were performed in 7
patients, and flow cytometry immunophenotyping
was performed in 3 patients. Sixteen of the 23
patients with MS received cytarabine plus idarubicin
or fludarabine at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, as
described previously.9 Two patients underwent surgical resection only, and 5 patients were treated outside of M. D. Anderson. The 1720 patients who had
AML in the bone marrow (>20% blasts and excluding
patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia) presented during the same period and received similar
induction therapy; however, patients with MS were
less likely to receive therapy after they achieved a
complete response (CR) (Table 1). All patients gave
informed consent for treatment, which was carried
out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The M. D. Anderson Institutional Review Board
approved the analyses described below.

Statistical Methods
The Fisher exact test was used in univariate analyses.
Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-

1371

Meier method, and survival between groups was
compared using the 2-sided log-rank test. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model
was used to examine risk factors related to survival
or event-free survival (EFS) after adjusting for other
factors, including diagnosis (MS vs AML).
We were interested principally in EFS (with an
‘event’ defined as relapse, death, or failure to achieve
CR) and overall survival (OS). For patients with AML,
we used previously defined criteria for a CR, whereas
the criterion for a CR for patients with MS was complete radiologic disappearance of disease. Differences
in EFS and OS between patients with MS and AML
were quantified with the log-rank test. To reduce the
possibility that any differences merely reflected a
better inherent prognosis in the MS (or the AML)
group, we attempted to find as many prognostically
comparable matches (‘pair mates’) as possible for
each MS patient from among the 1720 patients with
AML. Criteria for matching were as follows: cytogenetics, as described below; age (within 3 years);
Zubrod performance status (0-2 vs >2); and time of
treatment (1990-1997 vs 1998-2004). Matches fell
into 3 categories: 1) an event had occurred in the MS
patient and the patient’s AML pair mate, 2) an event
had occurred in either the patient or in the pair
mate, or 3) an event had occurred in neither the
patient nor the pair mate. In categories 1 and 2, if
EFS was longer in the patient with MS than in the
AML pair mate, then the patient with MS was considered to be the ‘winner,’; whereas, if EFS was longer in the AML pair mate, then the MS patient was
considered to be the ‘loser.’ In category 3, the
matches were considered ‘ties.’ The numbers of wins
and losses for patients with MS were summed. If EFS
in patients with MS and AML was equivalent, then
the number of wins would be expected to equal the
number of losses.
OS and EFS in matched MS and AML patients
were compared using Kaplan-Meier methodology.
Statistical analyses were carried out using S Plus
2000 (Insightful Corp., Seattle, Wash). P values were
derived from 2-sided tests and were significant if
<.05.

RESULTS
The median age of the 23 patients with MS was 57
years (range, 7-81 years), and 1 patient (4%) had a
Zubrod performance status >2 (Table 1). Biopsy specimens were obtained from the skin (n 5 10
patients), lymph node (n 5 5 patients), dura (n 5 2
patients), breast and skin (n 5 1 patient), bladder
(n 5 1 patient), widespread involvement of the

gynecologic tract (n 5 1 patient), pleura and chest
wall (n 5 1 patient), retroperitoneum (n 5 1 patient),
and small intestine (n 5 1 patient). In each specimen, the histologic findings were consistent with the
diagnosis of MS. The antibodies used for immunohistochemical analysis were highly variable; however,
in all specimens, the neoplastic cells were positive
for 1 or more myeloid antigens and were negative for
T- and B-cell antigens. Myeloperoxidase was positive
in 13 of 14 specimens, lysozyme was positive in 7 of
8 specimens, CD13 was positive in 5 of 5 specimens,
CD33 was positive in 4 of 4 specimens, CD34 was
positive in 6 of 8, CD68 was positive in 5 of 7 specimens, and CD43 was positive in 4 of 4 specimens.
Six of 9 specimens that were assessed for chloroacetate esterase were positive, including 2 specimens
that were not assessed by immunohistochemical
analysis. The 1 neoplasm in this study that was not
assessed by either immunohistochemistry or cytochemistry was histologically well differentiated and
had obvious eosinophilic differentiation.
Among the 9 MS patients aged >60 years, 1
patient had cytogenetics assessed in the tumor sample (this patient had a 12p deletion), and 4 patients
had a 1 8 abnormality in the bone marrow despite
no excess blasts. The remaining 4 older MS patients
had normal bone marrow cytogenetics but, of course,
no excess blasts. Three of the 14 MS patients aged
<60 years had cytogenetics assessed in the tumor
sample: 1 patient had an 11q deletion in a complex
karyotype, 1 patient had a deletion of 3 in a complex
karyotype, and 1 patient had an 8q deletion. An additional 4 MS patients aged <60 years had cytogenetic
abnormalities in the bone marrow despite the absence of excess blasts: inversion (16) in 2 patients,
18 in 1 patient, and 27 in 1 patient. The remaining
8 MS patients aged <60 years had normal cytogenetics in the bone marrow.
The median age of the 1720 patients with AML
was 60 years (range, 14-89 years), and 173 patients
(11%) had a Zubrod performance status of 3 or 4
(Table 1). The proportion of patients with a 1 8 abnormality was much lower in the AML group than in
the MS group (127 of 1720 vs 5 of 23; Fisher exact
test; P 5 .02).

Response, Event-free Survival, and Overall Survival
We focused on the 16 MS patients who were treated
at M. D. Anderson with cytarabine combined with
idarubicin or fludarabine. Eleven of those 16 patients
(69%) achieved a CR, as did 57% of the similarly treated AML patients (P 5 .45). The median follow-up for
patients who remained alive in CR were 3.5 years for
the MS group and 5.3 years for the AML group. EFS

was longer in the MS group (P 5 .08) (Fig. 1). OS differences were less marked (P 5 .11) (Fig. 2).

Multivariate Cox Analysis in Cytarabine-treated Patients
Next, we performed a multivariate analysis of EFS in
patients who were treated with cytarabine (16 MS
patients and 1720 AML patients). Independent factors that predicted a shorter EFS were poorer risk cytogenetics (P<.0001), worse performance status
(P<.0001), history of antecedent hematologic disorder
(AHD) (history of a hemoglobin level <12 g/dL, a
platelet count <150,000/lL, a neutrophil count
<1500/lL, or a white blood cell [WBC] count
>20,000/lL for at least 1 month before presentation
at M. D. Anderson; P<.0001), and higher leukocyte
counts (P 5 .001). The diagnosis of MS versus AML
was not a significant factor (P 5 .85).
Similarly, independent factors that predicted a
shorter OS were poorer risk cytogenetics (P<.0001),
worse performance status (P<.0001), a history of
AHD (P<.0001), and higher leukocyte counts (P 5
.01), but diagnosis was not significant (P 5 .75).
Matching of MS Patients With AML Patients
Although cytogenetics constitute a major prognostic
factor in patients with AML, the 12 patients with MS
who did not have tumor cytogenetics assessed in MS
tissue and who had normal bone marrow cytogenetics were not informative cytogenetically. We
addressed this problem as follows. Because 4 of the 5
MS patients aged 60 years with known cytogenetic
abnormalities had 1 8 abnormalities (see above), we
matched similarly aged MS patients who did not
have cytogenetics assessed in MS tissue and had nor-

mal bone marrow with AML patients who had 1 8
abnormalities. Analogously, the distribution of cytogenetic abnormalities in patients with MS aged <60
years who had cytogenetics assessed or had known
abnormal bone marrow (2 prognostically favorable
[inversion 16], 2 prognostically intermediate [18,
8q2], and 3 prognostically unfavorable [11q, complex deletion 3q, 27]) led us to attempt to pair each
MS patient aged <60 years who had normal bone
marrow cytogenetics and unknown MS cytogenetics
with an equal number of AML patients who had
favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable cytogenetics, according to the common definitions.10
Details regarding the matching of MS patients
and AML patients are shown in Table 2. Matches
were found for 14 of 16 patients with MS. One MS
patient had no AML match because he was aged 7
years (all patients with AML in our database were
aged >14 years). The second MS patient had a performance status of 4, for which there was no match
among the AML patients.
Ninety-four matches, representing 91 patients
with AML, were found, with 3 AML patients each
matched to 2 separate MS patients. For 3 MS
patients aged <60 years, only AML patients with
favorable and intermediate cytogenetics could be
matched; the absence of an unfavorable AML match
presumably would tend to make the MS group
appear less favorable. Among the 11 AML matches
for the first MS patient (MS1), 7 AML matches had
longer EFS, and 4 had shorter EFS compared with
Patient MS1 (Table 2). Proceeding in this fashion, we
found 56 matches that favored MS, 26 matches that
favored AML, and 12 inconclusive matches (Table 3).

MS indicates myeloid sarcoma; EFS, event-free survival; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; OS, overall survival.

kemia (AML) (Kaplan-Meier analysis). N indicates number.

If EFS duration in MS and AML was identical, we
expected that MS patients would have an equal
number of ‘wins’ and ‘losses,’ (ie, 47 wins and 47
losses). By using the Fisher exact test comparing 56
of 82 matches and 47 of 94 matches, the P value
was .01.
When the analysis was limited to MS patients
who had informative cytogenetics (Patients MS1,
MS3, MS4, MS7, MS8, and MS13), the observed 32
wins for MS versus 26 wins for AML, with 5 ties,

translated into a 71% probability of longer EFS in
patients with MS. Similarly, when OS was compared
in matched patients, 46 matches favored MS, 20
favored AML, and 28 were inconclusive (Tables 2, 3).
By using the Fisher exact test comparing 46 of 66
matches and 47 of 94 matches, the P value was .01.
The EFS and OS of 14 patients with MS and 91 control patients with AML calculated by using the
Kaplan-Meier method are compared in Figures 3
and 4.

Treatment Outcomes in MS and AML/Tsimberidou et al

Outcomes in the 2 Unmatched MS Patients
At the time of this writing, the MS patient aged 7
years was alive in a first CR 11 months after beginning treatment, and the MS patient with Zubrod performance status 4 died 4 months into treatment
without achieving a CR.

DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrates that anti-AML therapy is highly effective in patients with nonleukemic
MS and is associated with higher rates of EFS and
OS in MS than in AML after matching MS patients
with comparable, typical AML patients according to
age, performance status, year of treatment, and, to
the extent possible, conventional cytogenetics. To
our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest that
EFS is longer in patients with MS than in patients
with AML (Fig. 1). However, the data in Figure 1 do
not address the issue of comparability between the
MS patients and the AML patients; that is, how do
we know that the results can be attributed primarily
to a different diagnosis (MS vs AML) rather than to
differences in treatment, follow-up, or prognostic
covariates? Regarding treatment, the patients with
MS and the patients with AML received cytarabinecontaining induction therapy, although the patients
with MS were less likely to receive postremission
therapy (Table 1). Follow-up was similar in the 2
groups, and the median follow-up was >3 years,
which is relevant given previous suggestions that the
risk of relapse declines 3 years after the CR date, and
such patients can be considered potentially cured.
The cytogenetically noninformative status (cytogenetics not done on MS samples and normal in
bone marrow) of 8 of the 14 MS patients in our
matching analysis made it difficult to assess comparability with AML patients. Of course, it is possible
that the patients who did not have cytogenetics evaluated in MS tissue and had normal bone marrow, in
fact, had cytogenetically normal MS tissue (ie, these
patients were informative cytogenetically). Arguing
against this possibility is the incidence of cytogenetic
abnormalities (4 of 4) in patients for whom cytogenetics were investigated in MS tissue. The possibility
that MS patients with normal bone marrow cytogenetics would have been cytogenetically abnormal if
MS tissue had been examined led us to match these
patients with AML patients who had abnormal cytogenetics, with the AML patients chosen on the basis
of the distribution of cytogenetic abnormalities
observed in the informative MS patients.
Results from the matching analysis suggest a
99% probability that EFS and OS are longer in MS

1377

patients after accounting for age, performance status,
year of treatment, and cytogenetics. Limiting our
analysis to matches involving cytogenetically informative MS patients, we reached a qualitatively similar
conclusion, ie, a diagnosis of MS is associated per se
with longer EFS. It remains possible that any conclusion is influenced by selection bias; specifically, only
16 of 23 MS patients received cytarabine-containing
therapy compared with >90% of AML patients. More
generally, our MS patients may not be representative
of MS patients in the general population; for example, in the current study, the median age of our MS
patients (57 years) was older than the median age
(37 years) in a previous review of 74 MS patients.11
The better outcomes of the MS patients in our
study may be explained by earlier stage disease, with
less of a tumor load associated with the infiltration
of extramedullary sites by leukemic blasts compared
with AML. It is also conceivable that the better outcomes simply reflect the finding that, even if they
are untreated, patients with MS may not die until
they develop AML. This would indicate the presence
of a lead-time advantage for the MS patients. Even if
this is true, we are not prepared to recommend that
the treatment of patients with MS be postponed until
AML develops.
The current results emphasize the need to treat
patients who have nonleukemic MS with AML-type
therapy. Patients with nonleukemic MS should be enrolled in clinical trials for AML and may benefit from
risk-adapted therapies that account for age, performance status, and cytogenetics.
