BACKGROUND: Chemoprevention with systemic retinoids has demonstrated promise in decreasing the incidence of
new primary nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) in immunocompromised post-transplantation recipients. There is
limited evidence for the use of systemic retinoids in the nontransplantation patient. To the authors’ knowledge, this is
the first randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of acitretin as a chemopreventive agent in nontransplantation patients at high risk for NMSC. METHODS: The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial. To test the possible skin cancer-preventing effect of a 2-year treatment with acitretin,
70 nontransplantation patients aged 18 years who had a history of 2 NMSCs within 5 years of trial onset were
randomized to receive either placebo or acitretin 25 mg orally 5 days per week. The primary outcome measure was
the rate of new NMSC development. RESULTS: Seventy patients were randomized to receive either acitretin alone (N
¼ 35) or placebo (N ¼ 35). During the 2-year treatment period, the patients who received acitretin did not have a
statistically significant reduction in the rate of new primary NMSCs (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.151.13; 54% vs 74%; P ¼ .13). However, using the incidence of new NMSC, the time to new NMSC, and total NMSC counts,
an umbrella test indicated a significant trend that favored the use of acitretin (chi-square statistic, 3.94; P ¼ .047).
The patients who received acitretin reported significantly more mucositis and skin toxicities compared with the
patients who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was not a statistically significant benefit observed

INTRODUCTION
It is estimated that nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC) account for nearly 3.5 million new cancer diagnoses yearly, far
exceeding the annual incidence of all other cancers combined.1 Although rarely the primary cause of death, NMSCs result
in a large health care expenditure each year and can lead to significant morbidity in some patients because of loss of function and disfigurement. Basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) make up the vast majority of
NMSCs and occur at a ratio of approximately 4:1.2
Multiple risk factors for NMSC have been identified through decades of epidemiologic research, including older
age, fair skin phenotype, tendency toward sunburn, chronic sun exposure, previous precancerous lesions (actinic keratoses), previous skin cancers, chronic immunosuppression, and infection with the human papilloma virus.3,4 It has been
demonstrated that patients who have a history of NMSC have the greatest risk of developing new primary NMSC.5 The
rate of new primary NMSC in patients who have a history of 10 NMSCs nears 100%.6

Acitretin for Prevention of Skin Cancer/Kadakia et al

Systemic retinoids have demonstrated promise in
reducing the rate of NMSC in certain high-risk populations. In previous randomized controlled trials, the use of
systemic retinoids was proven effective in reducing the development of new primary NMSCs or new precancerous
lesions in immunocompromised patients after transplantation.7-10 In a trial by Bavinck et al, patients who underwent renal transplantation had a significant reduction in
new primary NMSC with acitretin compared with placebo over a 6-month period.7 In another trial, the effect of
acitretin over a 2-year period significantly decreased the
development of new SCC.10 In a trial led by de Sevaux et
al, the utility of acitretin revealed a decrease in the rate of
new actinic keratoses, but not in new skin malignancies.9
Systemic retinoids also have demonstrated benefit in
preventing NMSC in high-risk, nontransplantation
populations, such as patients who receive psoralen-ultraviolet A light treatment and patients with xeroderma
pigmentosa.11,12
Despite the benefit gained through the use of retinoids like acitretin, in patients who undergo transplantation, the utility of these agents for those who do not
undergo transplantation has yet to be fully elucidated. In
1997, Levine et al reported that high-risk patients (with
>4 previous NMSC) who received either systemic retinol
or isotretinoin had no difference in the incidence or the
time to first new NMSC compared with patients who
received placebo.13 Another trial demonstrated that systemic retinol significantly reduced the risk of new SCC
compared with placebo in patients who reportedly were at
moderate risk for NMSC.14 However, pooled data from
both of those trials did not demonstrate a significant difference in the time to first SCC or BCC.15 In a trial that
assessed the chemopreventive effect of low-dose isotretinoin in patients with a history of BCC, no difference was
observed in the incidence or the time to first new BCC.16
The use of acitretin, a newer second-generation retinoid,
has not been reported to date in high-risk, nontransplantation patients. Here, we report the results from a
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, chemoprevention trial assessing the utility of acitretin in patients
with a history of multiple NMSCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
To be eligible for this trial, patients had to be aged 18
years, were required to have a history of 2 NMSCs and
to have received previous treatment for all visible SCC

and BCC, and could not have received any retinoids
within 1 year of registration. Approval by the investigational review boards of participating centers before patient
enrollment was required, and all participants were
required to provide written informed consent before trial
entry. Initially, this clinical trial included organ-transplantation recipients who were receiving immunosuppressive
agents, and we planned to stratify patients by transplantation status. However, because of low accrual of this subset
of patients caused by exclusion from the study based on
laboratory abnormalities, subsequently, the trial was
modified to exclude further enrollment of transplantation
recipients.
Patients were excluded if they had a creatinine level
>1.5 times the upper limit of normal, a serum cholesterol
level >250 mg/dL, a serum triglyceride level >2.5 times
the upper limit of normal, or elevated liver function tests
(LFTs). Patients also were excluded if they were women of
childbearing potential or if they had a life expectancy <5
years.
The clinical trial was designed as a prospective,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and
was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review
Board according to US federal guidelines. Patients were
stratified according to age, number of skin cancers within
the past 5 years, date of the most recent skin cancer occurrence, transplantation status (initial patients), patientreported sunburn susceptibility (Fitzpatrick skin-type),
and assessment of visible skin damage. Assessment of visible skin damage involved categorization based on the presence of actinic keratoses, lentigines, wrinkling, and
telangiectasia. Minimal, moderate, or extensive skin damage was defined as 1, 2 or 3, or 4 of these findings, respectively. Next, the patients were randomized to 1 of 2
treatment arms (acitretin vs placebo).
The acitretin and placebo capsules were provided in
blinded fashion by Roche Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland). Patients were provided either 25 mg acitretin or
an identical appearing placebo. Capsules were taken orally
5 days weekly for 2 years.
Initial history, skin examination, and laboratory
studies were obtained less than 90 days before registration.
Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1 month, 6 months, 12
months, 18 months, and 24 months. At the time of trial
initiation and at each subsequent follow-up, the skin was
examined by the patients’ dermatologists.
The effect of acitretin on the development of new
primary NMSC was assessed according to the incidence
of new SCC or BCC in these high-risk patients between

the start of the trial through 2 years. The effect of acitretin
also was assessed according to the time to first new
NMSC based on the date of the last NMSC resection and
the time on study. To be included as developing a new
primary NMSC within the first year, a patient must have
had an NMSC documented from the start of the trial to
either the 6-month or 12-month follow-up visit. The development of a new primary NMSC within the second
year was defined as having a documented NMSC from 12
months to either the 18-month or 24-month follow-up
visit. Review of the medical records up to 2 years after the
date on study was completed for all patients, including
those who discontinued treatment. The degree of actinic
damage from the start of the study to its completion also
was assessed.
Adverse events were graded at each follow-up visit
using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events grading system (version 2.0; National Cancer
Institute, Bethesda, MD).17 The following symptoms
were specifically monitored: alopecia, skin toxicities,
mucositis, arthritis, fatigue, headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Monitoring of biochemical fluctuation was determined by serum creatinine, cholesterol, triglyceride,
potassium, and LFTs at every follow-up visit.
Statistical Considerations
The primary outcome measure was the rate of new primary NMSC development. All hypothesis testing was carried out using a 2-sided alternative and a 5% type I error
rate using the SAS System for Unix software package (version 9; SAS Inc., Cary, NC).
For primary analysis, we used the Fisher exact test to
compare the rate of new NMSC development between
the acitretin and placebo treatment arms.18 The numbers
of new NMSCs and maximum adverse event grades were
compared using nonparametric Wilcoxon tests.19 A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to
examine which clinical and demographic characteristics
were related to the development of a new NMSC.20
The time to new NMSC development was measured
from the date of the last NMSC resection and from the
date on study and was compared between the acitretin
and placebo treatment groups using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank and Wilcoxon tests. A multivariate Cox model was used to test for a consistent
treatment effect after adjusting for baseline characteristics.21 With a small sample size, the power of each individual test is low. The O’Brien umbrella test was used to
determine whether the combined tests indicated a signifi-

2130

cant trend toward favoring acitretin.22,23 The variables
that were included in this test for trend included the incidence of new NMSCs, the time to developing new
NMSCs, and the total NMSC count.
The original design was to have 110 patients per
treatment arm, which would provide 80% power to detect
a 33% difference in NMSC incidence rates. The attained
sample size of 35 patients per group provided 51% power
to detect a difference of incidence in NMSC of 11% versus 33%. This sample size provided 82% power to detect
a difference in NMSC of 5% versus 33% or 11% versus
43%.

RESULTS
In total, 73 patients were enrolled from May 26, 2000 to
April 16, 2004, when the trial closed because of slow
accrual. Patient flow is illustrated in Figure 1. In all, 70
nontransplantation patients, including 35 in the acitretin arm and 35 in the placebo arm, initiated protocol
treatment and were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Analysis was completed on the entire available
patient cohort, including the 2 initially enrolled transplantation recipients and with the exclusion of those 2
patients. Virtually identical results were observed with
both cohorts. Data are presented below for the nontransplantation patient cohort. The demographics, clinical,
and other patient characteristics were well balanced (see
Table 1).
Attrition rates were relatively high in both groups.
In total, 53 patients completed the 2-year study according
to protocol. Reasons for patients stopping treatment were
similar across the 2 treatment arms, and the most common reason was refusal of further treatment (acitretin
arm, 9 of 35 patients [26%]; placebo arm, 6 of 34 patients
[17%]; P ¼ .22). Of the 9 patients in the acitretin arm
who stopped therapy early, 5 reported grade 1 and 2 skin
toxicities and alopecia, 1 reported dyspepsia, 1 stopped
because of a feeling of polypharmacy, 1 had recurrence of
a previously resected invasive SCC and refused further
treatment, and 1 refused further treatment because of
multiple, stable, nondermatologic medical comorbidities.
Two patients in the acitretin arm were lost to follow-up
and had no retrievable information throughout the 2-year
period. After these 2 patients were censored, the primary
endpoint remained unchanged. Of the 6 patients in the
placebo arm, 2 refused further treatment because of
nonspecific arthritic symptoms, 1 stopped because of an
exacerbation of chronic psoriasis, 1 patient died from

other medical comorbidities, and 2 stopped for unclear
reasons.
Efficacy
For the primary outcome measure (Fig. 2), the rate of new
primary NMSC development, although the acitretin arm
fared better numerically, there was no statistically significant difference between the placebo arm versus the acitretin arm (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.15-1.13; P ¼ .13). Likewise, no statistically significant
difference was observed in the time to developing a first
new NMSC between the treatment arms from the date of
study initiation. The time to the first new NMSC for the
2 treatment arms is illustrated in Figure 3, and Table 2
provides the incidence of new NMSC at each evaluation
interval. Table 2 indicates that 46% of patients in the acitretin arm had no NMSC at all compared with 26% of
patients in the placebo arm. At 6 months, the difference

Cancer

April 15, 2012

still was in favor of acitretin (23% vs 40%). Although the
numerical differences appeared large, the small sample
size prohibited a definitive statement regarding efficacy.
The time to the first new NMSC also was analyzed from
the date of the last NMSC resection and produced similar
results.
A multivariate logistic analysis was performed to
assess the risk factors for developing a new NMSC (Table
3). After adjusting for other baseline characteristics,
patients on the acitretin arm had numerically lower
rates of developing new NMSC; however, the difference
did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio,
0.33; 95% CI, 0.10-1.04; P ¼ .06). No other characteristics identified were associated with a lower rate of
NMSC.
A multivariate Cox model (Table 4) indicated that,
after adjusting for other baseline characteristics, patients
who received acitretin had a significantly longer time to

history of 2 to 5 previous NMSC resections, compared
with 6 resections, also was associated with a longer time
to developing a first new NMSC. Patients ages 60 to 69
years and patients with their most recent NMSC resection
within 12 months of study initiation had a shorter time to
developing new NMSC.
Nineteen patients (54%) and 26 patients (74%)
developed at least 1 NMSC during the course of the trial
in the acitretin and placebo arms, respectively. Analysis of
the total number of new SCCs and BCCs separately is
illustrated in Figure 4. Noting that 1 patient was an outlier in the placebo group, with 24 documented BCCs during the 2-year period, the total number of NMSCs
observed in the acitretin arm was significantly less over the

3.4  4.51 NMSCs, respectively. The degree of actinic
damage at each evaluation interval is outlined in Table 5,
and a significant difference was not observed between the
treatment and placebo arms; however, there was a considerable degree of missing documentation over the course of
the 2-year study period.
Using multiple endpoints assessed in this trial (incidence of new NMSCs, time to new NMSCs, and total
NMSC counts), O’Brien’s umbrella test favored the use
of acitretin (chi-square statistic, 3.94; P ¼ .047). With
censorship of the 2 patients in the acitretin arm who were
lost to follow-up, this P value was .08.

Adverse Events

arm reported significantly more alopecia, mucositis, and

mia and elevated LFTs compared with patients on the placebo arm; however, nearly all events were grade 1, and the
differences were not statistically significant between treatment arms (P ¼ .33 and P ¼ .49, respectively).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first published trial to investigate the utility of acitretin as a chemopreventive agent
against NMSC in high-risk, nontransplantation patients.
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial, acitretin failed to significantly reduce the incidence
or the time to first new NMSC in patients who had 2
previous NMSCs. However, there was a significant reduction in total NMSCs, and we observed a trend that
favored the utility of acitretin over the 2-year period.
Positive and confirmatory data have been reported
regarding the utility of retinoids as chemopreventive
agents in immunocompromised patients (ie, renal transplantation recipients), as reported previously.7,9,10 However, data supporting the use of these agents for
chemoprevention in high-risk, nontransplantation, presumably immunocompetent patients have not been
adequately examined.
Several aspects of the current trial may account for
the lack of benefit observed in the study arm. Most important, as a pilot study, the current trial was designed to
detect a large effect size (33% difference in incidence
rates), but this was not achieved. The observed effect size
was 25%, which, at the least, is worthy of further confirmatory investigation. This lack of power may account for
the impressive yet nonsignificant odds ratio observed
regarding the cumulative incidence of NMSC in the

patient had more than 1 NMSC (ie, 4 NMSCs [3 BCCs
and 1 SCCs]) over the remaining 2-year period. This is intriguing, because other trials demonstrated a more profound rebound effect with the development of numerous
NMSCs once retinoid therapy was discontinued.7,10,24-26
This suggests that the current trial participants may have
constituted an inherently lower risk population despite an
NMSC history similar to that of previously studied transplantation populations.10,25 Approximately 50% of
patients in the current trial had only 2 to 5 previous
NMSCs; this lower risk population, relative to the
remaining patients with 6 previous NMSCs, also may
account for the decreased efficacy in the overall cohort.
Third, the benefit observed with the test of trend was no
longer statistically significant after we censored the 2
patients in the acitretin arm who were lost to follow-up.

Despite the primarily negative results, the results
from this trial support the finding that acitretin decreased
the total number of SCCs and BCCs compared with placebo. In several trials, systemic retinoids have been more
effective in suppressing new SCCs compared with new
BCCs.10,14,16 However, in the current trial, acitretin
appeared to be similarly efficacious in suppressing both
SCC and BCC. The lack of effect on cumulative incidence rates probably is not related to the acitretin dose. In
the current trial, we used acitretin at a dose of 25 mg orally
for 5 days per week, a dose that was selected based on the
positive results from 3 randomized controlled trials assessing the agent’s efficacy in renal transplantation recipients.7,9,10 In the trial reported by de Sevaux et al, no
difference in NMSC development was observed when
higher dose acitretin was compared with lower dose acitretin. However, only 3 of 14 patients in that trial were able
to maintain high-dose therapy (0.4 mg/kg daily).9
In the current trial, we did not observe a statistically significant difference in any of the well known side
effects of retinoids on liver function disturbances and/or
hyperlipoproteinemia. More important, these laboratory

abnormalities were not the cause of the high attrition
rates in both treatment arms. This contrasts with the laboratory alterations reported in the study by George et al,
when higher doses (up to 50 mg daily) of acitretin were
used.10 The majority of patients in the acitretin arm who
did have adverse effects in the current trial had the common mucocutaneous side effects of retinoid use.27
Although not life-threatening, these adverse effects can
be sufficiently bothersome to patients that they discontinue treatment.

increased risk of developing lung cancer and with mortality.28-30 The systemic retinoid, isotretinoin, has been associated with increased mortality in a large, randomized
chemoprevention trial that involved patients with previously resected, stage I nonsmall cell carcinoma. This association, however, was based on a subgroup analysis and
was restricted to current smokers.29 It also has been suggested that beta-carotene, a less closely related compound,
increases the risk of lung cancer development as well as
mortality in smokers.31 To date, there has been no largescale trial involving systemic acitretin that has demonstrated a similar risk. In the current trial, we did not

stratify patients according to smoking status, and the trial
was not designed to assess mortality.
On the basis of available data, should acitretin be
recommended as a chemopreventive agent in high-risk,
nontransplantation patients? Although the current data
support the finding that acitretin decreases total tumor
burden, this benefit does not appear to correlate with a
decrease in the incidence of or a clinically meaningful
delay in new NMSC development. In addition, the toxicities from oral retinoids can be poorly tolerated. Thus, the
risk-to-benefit for considering systemic therapy with acitretin for chemoprevention of NMSC may be greater in
patients who have a higher burden of disease. Hopefully,
more efficacious and less toxic alternative forms of chemopreventive medications will be developed for the nontransplantation population.
