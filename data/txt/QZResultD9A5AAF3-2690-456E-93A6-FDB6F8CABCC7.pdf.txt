Abstract
The genome of a subset of non–small-cell lung cancers
(NSCLC) harbors a small inversion within chromosome 2 that
gives rise to a transforming fusion gene, EML4-ALK, which
encodes an activated protein tyrosine kinase. Although
breakpoints within EML4 have been identified in introns 13
and 20, giving rise to variants 1 and 2, respectively, of EML4ALK, it has remained unclear whether other isoforms of the
fusion gene are present in NSCLC cells. We have now screened
NSCLC specimens for other in-frame fusion cDNAs that
contain both EML4 and ALK sequences. Two slightly different
fusion cDNAs in which exon 6 of EML4 was joined to exon 20 of
ALK were each identified in two individuals of the cohort.
Whereas one cDNA contained only exons 1 to 6 of EML4
(variant 3a), the other also contained an additional 33-bp
sequence derived from intron 6 of EML4 (variant 3b). The
protein encoded by the latter cDNA thus contained an
insertion of 11 amino acids between the EML4 and ALK
sequences of that encoded by the former. Both variants 3a
and 3b of EML4-ALK exhibited marked transforming activity
in vitro as well as oncogenic activity in vivo. A lung cancer cell
line expressing endogenous variant 3 of EML4-ALK underwent
cell death on exposure to a specific inhibitor of ALK catalytic
activity. These data increase the frequency of EML4-ALK–
positive NSCLC tumors and bolster the clinical relevance of
this oncogenic kinase. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):4971–6]

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United
States, with >160,000 individuals dying of this condition in 2006 (1).
The efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic regimens with
regard to improving clinical outcome in lung cancer patients is
limited. Activating mutations within the epidermal growth factor
receptor gene (EGFR) have been identified in non–small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), the major subtype of lung cancer (2, 3), and
chemical inhibitors of the kinase activity of EGFR have been found
to be effective in the treatment of a subset of NSCLC patients
harboring such mutations. However, these somatic mutations of

EGFR are prevalent only among young women, nonsmokers, and
Asian populations (3, 4).
We recently identified a novel transforming fusion gene, EML4
(echinoderm microtubule–associated protein–like 4)-ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), in a clinical specimen of lung
adenocarcinoma from a 62-year-old male smoker (5). This fusion
gene was formed as the result of a small inversion within the short
arm of chromosome 2 that joined intron 13 of EML4 to intron 19 of
ALK (transcript ID ENST00000389048 in the Ensembl database5).
The EML4-ALK protein thus contained the amino-terminal half of
EML4 and the intracellular catalytic domain of ALK. Replacement
of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of ALK with
this region of EML4 results in constitutive dimerization of the
kinase domain of ALK and a consequent increase in its catalytic
activity (5).
Whereas this EML4-ALK fusion gene was detected in 3 of 75
individuals with NSCLC, we further identified another isoform of
EML4-ALK in two patients of the same cohort (5). In these two
individuals, intron 20 of EML4 was disrupted and joined to intron
19 of ALK, with the fusion protein thus consisting of the aminoterminal two thirds of EML4 and the intracellular domain of ALK.
This larger version of EML4-ALK was referred to as variant 2, with
the original smaller version being termed variant 1. A total of 5
of the 75 (6.7%) patients in the cohort were thus positive for
EML4-ALK.
Given that detection of EML4-ALK cDNA by the PCR would be
expected to provide a highly sensitive means for diagnosis of
lung cancer, and given that inhibition of the catalytic activity of
EML4-ALK may be an effective approach to treatment of this
disorder, we have examined whether other isoforms of EML4-ALK
are associated with NSCLC. We now describe a third isoform of
EML4-ALK (variant 3) that is smaller than variants 1 and 2.

Materials and Methods
PCR. This study was approved by the ethics committees of Jichi Medical
University and The Cancer Institute of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer
Research. Total cDNA of NSCLC specimens was synthesized with PowerScript reverse transcriptase (Clontech) and an oligo(dT) primer from total
RNA purified with the use of an RNeasy Mini RNA purification kit (Qiagen).
Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to amplify the fusion point of
EML4-ALK variant 3 mRNA was done with a QuantiTect SYBR Green kit

variant 3 was amplified from total cDNA of a NSCLC specimen (ID no. 2075)
with PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) and the primers
5¶-ACTCTGTCGGTCCGCTGAATGAAG-3¶ and 5¶-CCACGGTCTTAGGGATCCCAAGG-3¶; PCR was done for 35 cycles of 98jC for 10 s and
68jC for 6 min. The fusion point of EML4-ALK in the genome was amplified
by PCR with genomic DNA of NSCLC specimens, PrimeSTAR HS
DNA polymerase, and the primers 5¶-GGCATAAAGATGTCATCATCAACCAAGG-3¶ and 5¶-AGCTTGCTCAGCTTGTACTCAGGG-3¶. The nucleotide
sequences of the EML4-ALK variant 3a and 3b cDNAs have been deposited
in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession nos. AB374361 and AB374362,
respectively.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) analysis of the fusion gene was done with archival pathology
specimens and with bacterial artificial chromosomes containing genomic
DNA corresponding to EML4 or ALK and their flanking regions as probes.
In brief, surgically removed lung cancer tissue was fixed in 20% neutral

buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of
3 Am. The sections were placed on glass slides and processed with a
Histology FISH Accessory Kit (DakoCytomation) before hybridization with
the EML4 and ALK probes and examination with a fluorescence microscope
(BX61, Olympus).
Transforming activity of EML4-ALK variant 3. Analyses of the
function of EML4-ALK variant 3 were done as described previously (5). In
brief, the cDNA for EML4-ALK variant 3a or 3b was fused with an
oligonucleotide encoding the FLAG epitope tag and then inserted into the
retroviral expression plasmid pMXS (6). The resulting plasmids as well as
similar pMXS-based expression plasmids for EML4-ALK variant 1, variant
1 (K589M), or variant 2 were individually introduced into mouse 3T3
fibroblasts by the calcium phosphate method for a focus formation assay
and assay of tumorigenicity in nu/nu mice. The same set of EML4-ALK
proteins was expressed in HEK293 cells and assayed for kinase activity
in vitro with the YFF peptide (7).

responsible for generation of EML4-ALK variant 3.
A, schematic representation of the chromosomal
rearrangement underlying the generation of
EML4-ALK variant 3. Exon 6b of EML4 is located
188 bp downstream of exon 6a. In NSCLC
specimen ID no. 7969, EML4 is disrupted at a
position f7.1 kbp downstream of exon 6b and is
ligated to a position 749 bp upstream of exon 20 of
ALK, giving rise to the EML4-ALK (variant 3) fusion
gene. Horizontal arrows, direction of transcription.
B, FISH analysis of a representative cancer cell in a
histologic section of lung adenocarcinoma (ID no.
7969) with differentially labeled probes for EML4
(left) and ALK (center ). Two fusion signals (arrows )
and a pair of green (corresponding to EML4 ) and
red (corresponding to ALK) signals are present in
the merged image (right ).

The cDNA for FLAG-tagged EML4-ALK variant 3b was also inserted into
pMX-iresCD8 for the expression of both EML4-ALK and mouse CD8 (8), and
the resulting recombinant retroviruses were used to infect mouse BA/F3
cells (9). CD8-positive cells were then purified with the use of a miniMACS
magnetic bead–based separation system (Miltenyi Biotec) and cultured
in the absence or presence of mouse interleukin-3 (IL-3; Sigma) or 2,4pyrimidinediamine (Example 3-39, a specific inhibitor of ALK enzymatic
activity that was developed by Novartis6 and synthesized by Astellas
Pharma).
Mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and NCI-H2228 lung cancer cells (both from
American Type Culture Collection) as well as 3T3 cells expressing v-Ras
were plated in 96-well spheroid culture plates (Celltight Spheroid, Sumilon)
at a density of 1  103 per well. Cell growth was examined with the WST-1
Cell Proliferation Reagent (Clontech) after culture for 5 d with 2,4pyrimidinediamine.
Luciferase reporter assays. The promoter fragments of Fos, Myc, and
Bcl-xL genes were ligated to a luciferase cDNA to generate pFL700 (10),
pHXLuc (11), and pBclxl-Luc (12) reporter plasmids, respectively. Luciferase
cDNA ligated to the DNA binding sequence for nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) or
to the GAS sequence was obtained from Stratagene. HEK293 cells were
transfected with these various reporter plasmids together with the
expression plasmid for EML4-ALK variant 3b or the empty vector, as
described previously (13). The pGL4 plasmid (Promega) for expression of
Renilla luciferase was also included in each transfection mixture. After
culture of the cells for 2 d, luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured
with a Luciferase Assay system (Promega).

lead to the juxtaposition of exons 13 and 20 of EML4, respectively,
to exon 20 of ALK. It is theoretically possible that exon 2, 6, 18, or
21 of EML4 also could undergo in-frame fusion to exon 20 of ALK.
We therefore examined whether transcripts of any such novel
EML4-ALK fusion genes are present in NSCLC cells by RT-PCR
analysis with primers that flank each putative fusion point (data
not shown). With the primer set for amplification of the EML4
(exon 6)-ALK (exon 20) fusion cDNA, we detected a pair of PCR
products in two individuals with lung adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1A).
Although one of the patients (tumor ID no. 7969) had a smoking
index of 540, the other patient (tumor ID no. 2075) had never
smoked. Nucleotide sequencing of each PCR product from both
patients revealed that the smaller product of 515 bp corresponded
to a fusion cDNA linking exon 6 of EML4 to exon 20 of ALK,
whereas the larger product of 548 bp contained an additional
sequence of 33 bp that was located between these exons of EML4
and ALK and which mapped to intron 6 of EML4 (Fig. 1B). The
larger cDNA would thus be expected to encode a fusion protein
with an insertion of 11 amino acids between the EML4 and ALK
sequences of the protein encoded by the smaller cDNA.
Although we did not detect human mRNAs or expressed
sequence tags containing this cryptic exon of EML4 in the
nucleotide sequence databases, it is likely that this exon is
physiologic and functional because (a) the fusion cDNA containing
this exon was identified in two independent patients and in
amounts no less than those of the corresponding cDNA without it
(Fig. 1A); (b) the intron-exon boundary sequence for this exon
conforms well to the AG-GU rule for mRNA splicing (Fig. 1B); and
(c) EML4 cDNAs or expressed sequence tags containing this exon
were detected in the sequence databases for other species ( for
instance, GenBank accession no. AK144604 corresponding to a
mouse EML4 cDNA). We thus refer to this cryptic exon as exon 6b
and to the original exon 6 as exon 6a (Fig. 1B). The novel isoforms
of EML4-ALK transcripts containing exons 1 to 6a or 1 to 6b of
EML4 were also designated variants 3a and 3b, respectively.

Cancer Research

To isolate a full-length cDNA for EML4-ALK variant 3, we
performed RT-PCR with total cDNA of a positive specimen (ID
no. 2075) and with a sense strand primer targeted to the 5¶
untranslated region (UTR) of EML4 mRNA and an antisense strand
primer targeted to the 3¶ UTR of ALK mRNA. One-step PCR analysis
yielded cDNA products for both EML4-ALK variants 3a and 3b
(Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1).
The EML4 protein contains an amino-terminal basic domain
followed by a hydrophobic echinoderm microtubule–associated
protein–like protein (HELP) domain and WD repeats (14). Given

that exons 1 to 6 of EML4 encode the basic domain, the proteins
encoded by the variant 3 cDNAs contain the entire basic domain of
EML4 directly linked to the catalytic domain of ALK (Fig. 1D). The
fact that the basic domain was found to be essential for both the
self-dimerization and oncogenic activity of EML4-ALK (5)
suggested that the variant 3 isoforms likely also possess transforming activity.

sequence. Cells were cultured for 2 d, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity. The activity of firefly luciferase was normalized by that of Renilla luciferase. Columns,

malignant transformation. A, lysates of HEK293 cells
expressing FLAG-tagged EML4-ALK variant 3b (v3b ) were
divided into five equal portions, and each portion was subjected
to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to FLAG. The
immunoprecipitates were washed with kinase buffer
[10 mmol/L HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 50 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 5 mmol/L MnCl2, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4] containing 0, 1,
5, 10, or 50 nmol/L of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine and then
incubated for 30 min at room temperature for assay of kinase
activity with the YFF peptide in the continued absence or
presence of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine. The same amount of lysate
of cells transfected with the empty vector was also subjected to
immunoprecipitation and assayed as a negative control ( ).
B, mouse BA/F3 cells expressing CD8 alone were cultured
in the presence of IL-3 (1 ng/mL) and the indicated

with the indicated concentrations of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine
but without IL-3 (right ). Cell number was counted at the

at the same time with the use of the WST-1 assay (right ).

3, we attempted to amplify the fusion point between the two genes
from the genome of positive NSCLC cells. PCR with primers
targeted to regions flanking the putative fusion point yielded a
product of f8 kbp with the genomic DNA of tumor ID no. 7969
(data not shown). Our failure to detect an unambiguous PCR
product with genomic DNA of tumor ID no. 2075 may indicate that
the breakpoint in intron 6 of EML4 in this specimen is too distant
from exon 6 to be readily amplified by PCR (intron 6 of EML4 is
>16 kbp). Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR product for tumor ID
no. 7969 revealed that intron 6 of EML4 was disrupted at a position
f7.1 kbp downstream of exon 6b and was joined to a point 749 bp
upstream of exon 20 of ALK (Fig. 2A).
We also confirmed the chromosome rearrangement involving
EML4 and ALK by FISH analysis of cells from tumor ID no. 7969
(Fig. 2B) and tumor ID no. 2075 (data not shown) with differentially
labeled probes for the two genes. Both genes map to the short arm
of chromosome 2 within a distance of f12 Mbp. The tumor cells
exhibited fusion signals (corresponding to EML4-ALK) in addition
to a pair of isolated green and red signals (corresponding to the
two genes on the normal chromosome 2). The chromosome
rearrangement involving the ALK locus was further verified with a
different set of fluorescent probes (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Transforming activity of EML4-ALK variant 3. To compare
the transforming potential of variants 1, 2, 3a, and 3b of EML4-ALK,

we introduced expression plasmids for each variant into mouse
3T3 fibroblasts for assay of focus formation. No transformed foci
were detected for cells transfected with the empty plasmid or with
a plasmid for a kinase-inactive mutant (K589M) of EML4-ALK
variant 1 (5) in which Lys589 in the ATP binding site of the catalytic
domain is replaced with Met (Fig. 3A). In contrast, variants 3a and
3b of EML4-ALK each exhibited marked transforming activity that
was not less than that of variant 1 or 2. To examine directly the
tyrosine kinase activity of EML4-ALK variants, we subjected
HEK293 cells expressing each of these variants to an in vitro
kinase assay with a synthetic YFF peptide (7). Again, both variants
3a and 3b exhibited marked kinase activity that was not less than
that of variant 1 or 2 (Fig. 3B). Similarly, in a tumorigenicity assay
with nude mice, 3T3 cells expressing EML4-ALK variant 3b formed
large subcutaneous tumors at all injection sites (Fig. 3C).
Consistent with our previous observations (5), cells expressing
variant 1 or 2 of EML4-ALK also formed tumors.
To examine the intracellular signaling pathways activated by
EML4-ALK, we linked the luciferase cDNA to the promoter
fragment of Fos, Myc, or Bcl-xL gene (10–12); the DNA binding
sequence for NF-nB; or the GAS sequence [a target site of the
transcription factors signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 and STAT3; ref. 15]. The resulting constructs
were then introduced into HEK293 cells together with an

expression plasmid for EML4-ALK variant 3b. EML4-ALK variant 3b
markedly activated the promoters of the Fos and Myc genes
(Fig. 3D), consistent with the transforming potential of EML4-ALK.
In contrast, although STAT3 has been shown to be a downstream
target of the NPM-ALK fusion protein (16), EML4-ALK did not
activate the GAS sequence, suggesting that STAT3 is unlikely to be
a major target of EML4-ALK, as was shown in an EML4-ALK–
positive lung cancer cell line by a proteomics approach (17). The
distinct subcellular localizations of the two ALK fusion proteins
[EML4-ALK in the cytoplasm (5) and NPM-ALK in both the nucleus
and cytoplasm (18)] may account for this difference. Whereas
EML4-ALK did not activate the Bcl-xL gene promoter, it induced a
small but significant increase in the activity of the NF-nB binding
sequence (P = 1.86  10 4, Student’s t test).
Several compounds have recently been identified as specific
inhibitors of the kinase activity of ALK and as potential drugs
for the treatment of lymphoma positive for NPM-ALK (19). We
examined the effects of one such inhibitor, 2,4-pyrimidinediamine,
on the transforming potential of EML4-ALK. We first determined
the effect of this inhibitor on the kinase activity of EML4ALK variant 3b immunoprecipitated from transfected cells. 2,4Pyrimidinediamine inhibited the kinase activity of EML4-ALK
in a concentration-dependent manner, with a concentration of
1 nmol/L reducing the kinase activity to <50% of the control value
(Fig. 4A).
We also introduced EML4-ALK variant 3b and CD8 (or CD8
alone) into the IL-3–dependent hematopoietic cell line BA/F3 (9)
and then purified the resulting CD8-positive cell populations. 2,4Pyrimidinediamine, even at a concentration of 20 nmol/L, did not
affect the IL-3–dependent growth of BA/F3 cells expressing only
CD8 (Fig. 4B), indicating that this agent does not inhibit mitogenic
signaling mediated by Janus kinase in BA/F3 cells. Expression of
EML4-ALK rendered BA/F3 cells independent of IL-3 for growth,
but the cells expressing the fusion protein also rapidly underwent
cell death on exposure to 2,4-pyrimidinediamine (Fig. 4B).
Finally, we examined the effect of 2,4-pyrimidinediamine on lung
cancer cells that express endogenous EML4-ALK variant 3. The
human lung cancer cell line NCI-H2228 expresses EML4-ALK
variants 3a and 3b (data not shown) and forms spheroids in a

three-dimensional spheroid culture system (Fig. 4C; ref. 20).
Whereas 3T3 fibroblasts are unable to form such spheroids,
expression of v-Ras in these cells results in the formation of large
spheroids in culture. Whereas 2,4-pyrimidinediamine did not affect
the proliferation of 3T3 cells expressing v-Ras in this system, it
inhibited the growth of NCI-H2228 cells in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 4C). These data thus indicate that EML4ALK is essential for the growth of cancer cells expressing this
oncokinase.
In conclusion, we have identified novel isoforms of EML4-ALK in
two patients with NSCLC. A chromosome inversion within 2p was
shown to connect intron 6 of EML4 to intron 19 of ALK and to be
responsible for the generation of fusion cDNAs connecting exons 1
to 6a or exons 1 to 6b of EML4 to exon 20 of ALK. Given that fusion
cDNAs with or without exon 6b of EML4 were each present in the
two patients, EML4-ALK variant 3a and 3b proteins are likely to be
coexpressed in NSCLC cells. Although RT-PCR analysis to detect
EML4-ALK may provide a highly sensitive means to detect lung
cancer, it is important that all variant forms of the fusion gene be
assayed with appropriately designed primer sets. Given that all
the identified variants possess prominent transforming activity,
the newly revealed increased incidence of EML4-ALK fusion in
NSCLC further increases the importance of the fusion gene as a
therapeutic target for this intractable disorder.
