Aberrant BCL6 expression may repress Blimp1, which induces
B-cell differentiation into plasma cells and inhibits c-Myc
expression, leading to failure in both B cell differentiation and
cell cycle arrest (8). BCL6 also inhibits the expression of tumor
suppressor p53, preventing p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and
apoptotic response (9). Interestingly, BCL6 directly represses p21
expression through its binding to Miz-1 and suppresses cell cycle
arrest in germinal center B cells (10). The repressive effect of BCL6
on these cell cycle regulators may partly account for the pathologic
roles of BCL6 in lymphomagenesis.
Loss of the TGF-h antiproliferative response is a hallmark in
human cancer (1, 11). However, genetic mutations in Smads or
TGF-h receptors are rare in immune system–derived cancers
(12). Thus, the mechanisms underlying TGF-h resistance in
lymphoma or leukemia are largely elusive. In this study, we
report a physical and functional interaction between BCL6 and
Smad4. We found that B lymphoma cells that express a high
level of BCL6 are refractory to TGF-h growth-inhibitory
response, whereas knockdown of BCL6 expression restores
TGF-h–mediated cell cycle arrest in B lymphoma cells. The
results strongly suggest that aberrant expression of BCL6
promotes lymphomagenesis partly through its inhibition on
TGF-h signaling.

Abstract
Transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B) controls a wide
spectrum of cellular processes. Deregulation of TGF-B
signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases
including cancer and autoimmune diseases. TGF-B signaling is
generally mediated through intracellular signal transducers
and transcription factors called Smads. Herein, we have
identified the oncoprotein BCL6 as a transcriptional corepressor of tumor suppressor Smad4. BCL6 physically interacts
with Smad3 and Smad4, disrupts the Smad-p300 interaction,
and represses the transcriptional activity of Smad4. In
accordance, B-cell lymphoma cells with a high expression
level of BCL6 were found to be refractory to TGF-B
antiproliferative response, whereas knockdown of BCL6
expression in B-cell lymphoma cells partially restores the
TGF-B responses. This study provides strong evidence that
overexpression of BCL6 contributes to TGF-B resistance in
B-cell lymphoma. [Cancer Res 2008;68(3):783–9]

Introduction
Smad proteins are key intracellular signal transducers in the
transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) signaling pathways (1).
Upon TGF-h stimulation, TGF-h type II receptor phosphorylates
the type I receptor, which in turn, activates downstream Smad2
and Smad3. Activated Smad2 and Smad3 then form a heteromeric
complex with Smad4. The Smad complex is transported into
the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and/or interacts with other
transcription factors as well as recruiting coactivators or corepressors on the target gene promoters (2, 3). Context-dependent recruitment of transcriptional cofactors to the Smad complex largely
determines the genomic responses and physiologic outcomes of
cells in response to TGF-h.
BCL6, involved at breakpoints of chromosomal translocation
affecting band 3q27, encodes a transcriptional repressor (4).
Chromosomal translocations with deregulated BCL6 expression
are frequently observed in diffuse large B cell lymphomas and
follicular lymphomas, the two most common types of non–
Hodgkin lymphoma (5, 6). The mechanism of how BCL6 acts as an
oncogene has remained unclear. It has been thought that tumorassociated persistent expression of BCL6 at late stages of B-cell
differentiation blocks terminal differentiation, increases cell
survival, and progresses toward the transformed phenotype (7).

Materials and Methods
Expression plasmids. The mammalian expression plasmids for Flag/
HA-tagged Smads and rat TGF-h type I receptor (T202D) have been
previously described (13). The BCL6 coding region was subcloned into
pRK5 vector (Genentech) as Flag- or HA-tagged BCL6 proteins. Reporter
SBE-Luc (14) was used to measure TGF-h/Smad-mediated transcriptional
responses. The reporter 5xBCL6-Luc, containing five copies of BCL6
cognate binding sites, was used to detect transcriptional repression from
BCL6 (15).
Cell culture, transfection, immunoprecipitation, and Western
blotting. Human EBV-negative Burkitt-like lymphoma cell lines, BJAB,
Ramos, Daudi, and Raji were provided by Paul Ling, and cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. BJAB
cells were transiently transfected using Nucleofactor Kit T following the
instructions of the manufacturer (Amaxa Biosystems).
Immunoprecipitation from 293T cell lysates using anti-Flag (M2)
antibody were performed as described (13). Endogenous BCL6 in B
lymphoma cells was immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti-BCL6 (N3, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by
Western blotting using appropriate primary antibodies. The HDACSmad4-BCL6 ternary complex was detected as previously described (13).
Antibody-based array screening. The filter arrayed with antibodies
(Hypromatrix) was incubated with the lysate of 293T cells transfected with
Flag-Smad4 expression plasmid. The antibody-antigen-Smad4 complex was
detected by anti-Flag antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase.
Experimental details have been previously described (16).
shRNA-mediated knockdown of BCL6 expression. DNA coding for the
target small interfering RNA sequence against BCL6 (9) was subcloned into
retroviral vector pSRG (17). pSRG-shBCL6 was transfected into 293T with

packaging vector pCL-Ampho. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viruscontaining medium was harvested and passed through a 0.45-Am sterile
filter. Exponentially growing BJAB cells were infected by the filtered
medium supplemented with 0.5 Ag/mL of polybrene. Forty-eight hours after
infection, the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 2 Ag/mL of puromycin.
Growth inhibition assays. B lymphoma cells were seeded in 96-well ( for
MTT) or 12-well plates ( for [3H]thymidine) in appropriate density, and
treated with or without TGF-h. The assays using MTT One Solution kit
(Promega) were carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA
synthesis assay using [3H]thymidine incorporation was performed as
described (13).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. BJAB cells (2  10 7 ) were
cross-linked with formaldehyde, lysed, sonicated, and subjected to immunoprecipitation, essentially as described in an Upstate protocol. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-Smad4 (B8), anti-BCL6 (N3), or
control IgG serum, coupled with protein G-Sepharose beads. Immunocomplexes were reverse cross-linked to release DNA fragments, which were
amplified by PCR with primers corresponding to PAI-1 promoter (138 bp).
The PAI-1 promoter primer set contains 5¶-atggtaacccctggtcccgttc-3¶ and
5¶-gatacacggctgactcccccac-3¶. A sonication control PCR (260 bp) was done
using primer set 5¶-ttccattgctctaggatgcag-3¶ and 5¶-tgaatctgctgctgggtttct-3¶.

lymphoma cell lines in response to TGF-h. As shown in Fig. 1A,
BJAB, Loukes, Raji, and Daudi cells proliferated normally and
exhibited a TGF-h–resistant phenotype, whereas BL41 showed
sensitivity to TGF-h’s antiproliferative effect. We then measured
the levels of BCL6 in these B lymphoma cell lines, and found
that BCL6 is highly expressed in all four TGF-h–resistant cell
lines, but not in BL41 (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that the
high level of BCL6 is closely correlated with TGF-h resistance in
B lymphoma cells.
We also tested the effect of BCL6 on TGF-h–induced
transcriptional activation. Cell cycle inhibitor p21 is a TGF-h
signaling target gene, and its promoter is often used to faithfully
reflect the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-h. As shown in Fig.
1C, BCL6 dramatically represses TGF-h–induced p21 promoter
activity.
Knockdown of BCL6 restores response to TGF-B signaling
in B lymphoma cells. If the resistance to TGF-h–mediated
growth arrest results from BCL6 overexpression, reducing BCL6
level in B lymphoma cells may restore their response to TGF-h–
mediated growth arrest. Thus, we knocked down BCL6
expression in BJAB cells. Judging from anti-BCL6 Western
blotting analysis, we observed a significant decrease (routinely
f60% knockdown) of BCL6 protein in BJAB cells infected with
shBCL6 retroviruses, compared with those infected with control
shRNA retroviruses (Fig. 2A). We also examined the effect of
BLC6 on the activity of 5xBCL6-Luc reporter, the transcription of

reduced expression of BCL6 in B lymphoma cells restores the TGFh–induced SBE-Luc response.
Finally, we determined whether TGF-h–mediated growth
arrest was restored in BJAB cells expressing shBCL6. As shown
in Fig. 3B, BJAB cells expressing control shRNA did not show
any change in growth upon TGF-h treatment. In contrast, BJAB
cells expressing shBCL6 proliferated more slowly, and more
importantly, TGF-h inhibited DNA synthesis in the shBCL6 cells
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). In accordance, Western
blotting analysis indicates that TGF-h induced significantly
higher levels of all TGF-h target genes tested including p21,
p15, and PAI-1 (Fig. 3C). We also noted that basal levels of p21
increased in BCL6 knockdown BJAB cells, suggesting that
depletion of BCL6 may also enhance the activity of endogenous
p53 (9, 10) as well as that of autocrine TGF-h. This result clearly
shows that reduced BCL6 expression renders BJAB cells sensitive
to TGF-h–mediated growth inhibition, supporting the notion
that high BCL6 levels in B lymphoma cells inhibits
TGF-h–mediated growth inhibition. Furthermore, BCL6 knockdown also sensitized BJAB cells to exhibit higher induction of
Id1 reporter expression in response to BMP2 (Fig. 3D).
BCL6 interacts with Smad4 under physiologic conditions.
In a parallel attempt to identify regulators of TGF-h signaling,
we launched an antibody array–based screen to search for novel
Smad4-associated cellular proteins. Smad4 is the central
mediator in TGF-h signaling and is frequently deleted or
mutated in cancers (11). Among 400 signal transducers or
transcription factors, 20 proteins interacted with Smad4 (data
not shown). BCL6 was also identified as a candidate Smad4-

which could be repressed by BCL6 (15). Higher 5xBCL6-Luc
activity was observed in BJAB cells expressing shBCL6 compared
with controls (Fig. 2B), thereby functionally confirming the
knockdown of BCL6 in shBCL6 cells.
We next investigated whether BCL6 knockdown affected TGF-h–
induced transcription. As shown in Fig. 3A, there was no obvious
increase of SBE-Luc transcription upon TGF-h stimulation in BJAB
cells expressing control shRNA. However, SBE-Luc activity was
induced by TGF-h in cells expressing shBCL6, indicating that

tated with BCL6. These results suggest that BCL6 interacts with
both Smad3 and Smad4.
BCL6 does not interfere with Smad activation. Smad4 is
the central mediator for TGF-h signaling. Upon TGF-h ligand
binding, Smad4 forms a complex with Smad2/3, which translocates into the nucleus, where they cooperate with specific
transcription factors or general transcriptional coactivators to
exert their transcriptional regulation. After having determined
that BCL6 interacts with Smad4, we further examined if BCL6
interferes with Smad phosphorylation and Smad2-Smad4 complex formation. As shown in Fig. 5A, BJAB cells, which express a
high level of BCL6, retain the ability to induce endogenous
Smad2/3 phosphorylation in response to TGF-h. In addition,
BCL6 also had no effect on the phosphorylation of exogenous
Smad2/3 induced by constitutively active TGF-h type I receptor
(T202D; Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 8), consistent with the ability of
TGF-h to induce endogenous Smad2/3 phosphorylation in high
BCL6-expressing BJAB cells (Fig. 5A). Although BCL6 interacted
with Smad4, it did not interfere with the complex formation
between Smad4 and Smad2/3, as Myc-Smad2/3 and Flag-Smad4
could be similarly coimmunoprecipitated in the presence or
absence of BCL6 (Fig. 5C).

interacting protein (Fig. 4A). To further confirm this physical
interaction between BCL6 and Smad4, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Flag-BCL6 and HA-Smad4 were
cotransfected into 293T cells. Flag-BCL6 in cell lysates was
immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, and the immunoprecipitated complex was subjected to Western blot analysis
with anti-HA antibody to detect BCL6-bound Smad4. As shown
in Fig. 4B, Smad4 was clearly coimmunoprecipitated with BCL6
when Smad4 and BCL6 were coexpressed in cells (lane 3).
To determine if BCL6 interacts with Smad4 at endogenous
levels, anti-BCL6 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate
endogenous BCL6 proteins in BJAB lymphoma cells and then
the immunoprecipitated products were analyzed by anti-Smad4
Western blotting to detect BCL6-bound Smad4 protein. We found
that Smad4 could be coimmunoprecipitated with BCL6 by anti-BCL6
antibody, but not by control antibody (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3). Our
finding indicated that Smad4 interacts with BCL6 under physiologic
conditions.
To test if BCL6 interacts with other Smads, we performed
coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Results shown in Fig. 4D
confirm that Smad4 (lane 8) interacted with BCL6, and further
showed that Smad3 (lane 7) was also clearly coimmunoprecipi-

Inhibition of Smad Signaling by BCL6

BCL6 disrupts the interaction between Smads and p300.
Several studies have shown that transcriptional activity of Smads
requires the involvement of coactivator p300/CBP (18–20). We
next examined whether BCL6 interfered with the recruitment of
p300/CBP to the Smad complex. Complex formation between
p300 and Smad3/4 was investigated by coimmunoprecipitation
experiments. Coexpression of constitutively active TGF-h type I
receptor (T202D) induced a strong interaction between p300 and
Smad4 (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4) and between p300 and Smad3
(Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, BCL6 clearly attenuated the
p300-Smad4 (Fig. 6A, lane 5) and p300-Smad3 interaction (Fig.
6B, lane 5). These results suggest that BCL6 negatively regulates
the complex formation between Smad4 and coactivators, which
in turn, represses Smad4-mediated transcription activation and
TGF-h signaling.
Smads recruits BCL6 and class II HDACs into chromatin.
To examine if BCL6 could be recruited to endogenous TGF-h–
responsive promoters, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay on the PAI-1 promoter in BJAB cells. As
expected, Smad4 bound to the promoter region (nucleotides
792/ 655) of PAI-1 (Fig. 6C, top gel panel, lane 3). Notably, we
found that BCL6 could also be recruited to the same PAI-1
promoter region (Fig. 6C, top gel panel, lane 4). Thus, BCL6
could bind to an endogenous TGF-h–responsive promoter in a
chromatin environment. Furthermore, the binding of BCL6 and
Smad4 in the PAI-1 promoter region was specific as both
proteins failed to bind to a downstream region (nucleotides
+1282/1542) of the PAI-1 promoter (Fig. 6C, bottom gel panel,
lanes 3 and 4).
The COOH-terminal zinc finger domain of BCL6 binds to
Smad4 and suffices to repress TGF-h signaling (data not shown).
This repressive effect is achieved partly through the recruitment
of class II histone deacetylases such as HDAC5 (21). To
determine whether Smad4 interacts with BCL6 to recruit
HDAC4/5, we examined the potential formation of a ternary
complex consisting of Smad4, BCL6, and HDACs. We transfected
Myc-BCL6 and HA-Smad4 together with Flag-HDAC4 or FlagHDAC5 into 293T cells, constitutively active TGF-h type I

receptor (T202D) was cotransfected to explore the effect of TGF-h
treatment. As shown in Fig. 6D, only when the three components
(BCL6, Smad4, and HDACs) were coexpressed did we detect a
specific ternary complex. Furthermore, compared with HDAC4,
HDAC5 shows a higher ability to form ternary complexes with
Smad4 and BCL6 (Fig. 6D, lanes 8 and 9 versus lanes 4 and 5), which
is consistent with the higher affinity of HDAC5 to BCL6 (21). TGF-h
treatment seems to decrease the HDAC4 ternary complex while not
affecting the HDAC5 ternary complex (Fig. 6D, lanes 5 and 9 versus
lanes 4 and 8). These data suggest that through the interaction with
Smad4, BCL6 could also recruit class II HDAC into the Smad
complex, providing another mechanism to repress TGF-h signaling.

Discussion
BCL6 is frequently overexpressed in non–Hodgkin lymphomas
(6). The oncogenic role of BCL6 was also defined in engineered mice
expressing BCL6 constitutively, in which B cell lymphoma was
exhibited at high penetrance (22). Although it is generally thought
that BCL6 exerts its effect on lymphomagenesis through transcriptional repression of target genes that control B cell activation and
differentiation (5, 6), precise mechanisms for how BCL6 contributes
to lymphomagenesis remain unclear. Recently, it has been reported
that BCL6 represses the transcription of p53, thus inhibiting p53dependent cell growth arrest and apoptosis (9). In addition, BCL6
also inhibits cell growth arrest by repressing p21 promoter via
binding to Miz-1 (10). Our current study identifies Smad4 as another
tumor suppressor that BCL6 antagonizes, suggesting that targeting
tumor suppressor pathways may be one general mechanism
underlying BCL6’s oncogenic functions.
Loss of TGF-h–mediated growth control represents one major
mechanism in cancer development (11). In addition to genetic
lesions in the genes encoding Smads and TGF-h receptors, accumulating evidence has shown that the tumor suppressor
functions of Smads are blocked by oncogene products such as
c-Ski, c-Myc, and Evi-1 through direct Smad-oncoprotein
interactions (2). As B lymphomas often overexpress oncogene
BCL6, we reasoned that BCL6 might contribute to TGF-h

formation. Combinations of expression plasmids as indicated were cotransfected into 293T. The levels of Smad2/3-bound Smad4 did not change in the presence of
BCL6 in comparison with that in the absence of BCL6.

DNA fragments extracted from immune complexes as templates. The 138 bp PCR product spanning a Smad-binding element (SBE ) showed BCL6 recruitment to the

resistance in B lymphoma cells. Indeed, our current study reveals
a novel function of BCL6. Its high expression level inhibits the
tumor-suppressive function of Smads. Notably, shRNA-mediated
knockdown of BCL6 expression sensitizes B lymphoma cells to
TGF-h–mediated antiproliferative effects. BCL6 does not affect
TGF-h–induced signaling events in the cytoplasm such as
Smad2/3 phosphorylation and formation of the Smad2/3-Smad4
complex. Consistent with its nuclear repressor function, BCL6
dampens the interaction between Smads and coactivator p300,
and at the same time recruits HDAC4 and HDAC5 into the
complex to ensure complete blockade of TGF-h signaling. In
conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence demonstrating that BCL6 is a new oncogenic partner that interacts with

Smads and suggests that BCL6 induces lymphomagenesis partly
through disruption of the TGF-h pathway.
