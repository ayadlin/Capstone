BACKGROUND: The authors sought to determine the effect of chemotherapy on the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in
premenopausal and postmenopausal women undergoing (neo)adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: A total of
86 women with early-stage (AJCC stage I-III) breast cancer who were free from clinically diagnosed MetS (defined as 3 of 5 components of MetS) were prospectively tested for the presence of the 5 components of MetS within 1 week before initiating and after
completing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. The 5 components of MetS measured were waist circumference; blood pressure; and fasting levels of blood glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Anthropometrics (body weight, percentage body
fat, fat mass), lipid profile (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), glucose metabolism (insulin, homeostatic model
assessment of insulin resistance, glycated hemoglobin), and inflammation (C-reactive protein) also were examined before initiating
and after completing treatment. RESULTS: The current study included 46 premenopausal and 40 postmenopausal women. All individual MetS components and the overall MetS score were found to be statistically significantly increased (P<.01) after chemotherapy. Body weight, percentage body fat, fat mass, lipids, glucose metabolism, and inflammation also were found to be statistically
significantly increased (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week to 18-week course of chemotherapy appears to statistically significantly
increase MetS and related anthropometrics, biomarkers of glucose metabolism, and inflammation in patients with early-stage breast
cancer with no preexisting MetS. Lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise may be preventive approaches for use during

INTRODUCTION
Survivors of breast cancer comprise the largest subgroup of cancer survivors in the United States. Improvements in screening
and adjuvant therapies are credited with improving survival from breast cancer. These individuals experience many
treatment-associated changes, including weight gain,1 reduced physical activity levels,2 and worsening metabolic profiles
leading to metabolic syndrome (MetS).3 MetS includes a cluster of factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and central
obesity.4 It is a highly prevalent disorder, affecting approximately 25% of adults,5 and is associated with a 2-fold greater risk
of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.6 Specifically, MetS is diagnosed when a woman has any 3 of the 5 following components: 1) a waist circumference 80 cm (32 inches); 2) an elevated triglyceride (TRI) level 150 mg/dL or currently receiving drug treatment for an elevated TRI level; 3) reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <40 mg/dL; 4)
elevated blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg or currently receiving antihypertensive drug treatment; or 5) elevated fasting blood
glucose 100 mg/dL or currently receiving drug treatment for elevated glucose.7 MetS and associated factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, elevated inflammatory biomarkers, and altered adipokines, also
are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, all-cause mortality, and an increased risk of disease recurrence.8,9

Metabolic Syndrome, Chemotherapy, and Cancer/Dieli-Conwright et al

Postmenopausal patients with breast cancer experience negative changes in their MetS risk factors after
chemotherapy, thereby placing them at an increased risk
of mortality from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.10,11 It is interesting to note that a high rate of MetSrelated comorbidities was observed in women who
recently completed treatment of breast cancer, with obesity present in 51% of cases, hypertension in 34% of cases,
peripheral vascular disease in 26% of cases, and diabetes
in 13% of cases.12 Premenopausal patients with breast
cancer also experience detrimental effects from chemotherapy on conditions contributing to MetS; in particular,
their body weight may increase, leading to a higher body
mass index (BMI) and larger measures of central obesity.1
Furthermore, chemotherapy in premenopausal patients
with breast cancer may induce premature menopause,
which is associated with increases in body fat and cholesterol and TRI levels.1,13 Therefore, it is important to
monitor changes in MetS components in both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with breast cancer
during chemotherapy. Understanding the potential detrimental effects of chemotherapy on MetS components and
metabolic health is critical to controlling future chronic
health problems, improving survival, and enhancing quality of life as clinicians develop survivorship care plans for
patients with breast cancer.
The purpose of the current study was to investigate
the immediate effects of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy on
MetS components and related anthropometric and metabolic biomarkers among premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer with no
preexisting MetS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

We developed a prospective observational study that
recruited both premenopausal women and postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed, early-stage breast
cancer from the medical oncology clinics at City of Hope
(COH) National Medical Center. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at COH. We
obtained informed consent from each participant before
the baseline visit (within 1 week before the first treatment
visit). A research nurse screened all new patients with
breast cancer for the following eligibility criteria: 1)
women with newly diagnosed, stage I to III breast cancer;
2) age 18 years; 3) planned adjuvant chemotherapy after
lumpectomy or mastectomy or planned neoadjuvant
chemotherapy; and 4) ability to provide informed

consent. Participation in this outcome study did not influence the treatment regimens the women received. All
patients received chemotherapy as determined by their
treating oncologist.
Patients were excluded if they had MetS at the time
of chemotherapy. A woman was determined to have MetS
if she had any 3 of the following 5 components: 1) a waist
circumference 80 cm (32 inches); 2) a TRI level 150
mg/dL or currently receiving drug treatment for an elevated TRI level; 3) HDL-C <40 mg/dL; 4) blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg or currently receiving
antihypertensive drug treatment; or 5) fasting blood glucose 100 mg/dL or currently receiving drug treatment
for elevated blood glucose.7 Additional exclusion criteria
included 10% weight loss within the past 6 months or
the diagnosis of distant metastatic disease.
Study Measurements

All study measurements were performed on a single day at
baseline and after the final treatment visit (within 1 week
after the completion of chemotherapy) by trained research
staff at COH.
Blood pressure

Blood pressure was measured under resting conditions
(participants were seated for 5 minutes) using an automated blood pressure device (Connex ProBP; Welch
Allyn Inc, Skaneateles Falls, NY) and was performed twice
to ensure accuracy in measures.
Body composition

BMI measured in kg/m2 was calculated from height and
weight measurements. Body composition (lean body mass,
fat mass, and percentage body fat) was measured using a
portable hand-held bioelectrical impedance device (Omron
Healthcare, Hoffman Estates, Ill). Waist and hip circumferences were measured using a fabric measuring tape to
determine the circumference of the waist (centered at the
navel) and hip (centered on the greater trochanter) for each
participant, and used to calculate the waist/hip ratio.
Biomarkers

A 12-hour fasting blood sample was obtained for glucose,
insulin, lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and TRI levels), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and C-reactive protein (CRP).
Insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostatic
model assessment (HOMA-IR) as fasting glucose in mg/
dL multiplied by fasting insulin in mg/dL divided by
405.14 Blood samples were analyzed at the clinical pathology laboratory at COH. Lipids, glucose, insulin, and

CRP assays were analyzed on the Vitros 4600 Analyzer
(Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester, NY) using microslide technology. HbA1c was determined using highperformance liquid chromatography (Diazyme, Poway,
Calif).
Physical activity assessment

Physical activity history15 was assessed to capture varying
levels of physical activity throughout the patient’s lifetime
including current levels, quantified as the average number
of minutes per week per year over each 5-year period from
school age (aged 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19 years) through
adulthood (aged 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39 years and
onward to diagnosis).
Statistical Analysis
Sample size estimation

The recruitment of 50 evaluable patients (25 premenopausal and 25 postmenopausal women) would provide
80% power to detect an effect size of 0.584 (58% of the
standard deviation of the difference) using a Student t test
for paired data with a 2-sided significance level of .05 for
premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The
2648

decision to overenroll was made in the event that there
were meaningful differences in MetS between premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
All data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software
(version 18.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Standard
methods were used to compute means, standard deviations, and frequencies. Student t tests for paired samples
were used to compare MetS, anthropometric, and metabolic biomarkers before the initiation of and after the
completion of chemotherapy. One-way analysis of covariance was used to compare means adjusting for age, race,
type of chemotherapy, duration of chemotherapy, BMI at
baseline, and menopausal status. Bonferroni multiple
comparison post hoc tests were used to compare mean values. All statistical tests were conducted with 2-sided alternative hypotheses, and P values <.05 were considered to
be statistically significant.

eligible women, 86 women (56%) consented to participate in the study, 46 of whom (53%) were premenopausal
at the time of diagnosis. The primary reason for ineligibility was the presence of MetS at the time of diagnosis.
Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. The
mean age of the patients was 48.2 years (610.1 years).
The majority of patients were white (38 patients; 44%) or
Hispanic (26 patients; 30%), nonsmoking (82 patients;
95%), employed (73 patients; 85%), and well-educated
(77 patients; 90%). Overall, the population was sedentary, averaging 7.2 minutes (65.8 minutes) of physical activity per week within the previous 12 months. Initial
mastectomy was performed in 39 patients (45%) and
lumpectomy was performed in 29 patients (34%). Neoadjuvant therapy was administered in 18 patients (21%).
The chemotherapy regimens included dose-dense cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin followed by paclitaxel in
36 patients (42%); docetaxel and cyclophosphamide in
31 patients (36%); carboplatin and paclitaxel in 8 patients
(9%); cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin in 6 patients
(7%); or docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab in 5
patients (6%). The average duration of chemotherapy was
15.3 weeks (62.7 weeks). The duration and regimen of
chemotherapy did not appear to influence the results.

MetS Components

The individual components of MetS before and after
chemotherapy are shown in Table 2. After chemotherapy, a
new diagnosis of MetS was made in 72.5% of the patients.
Each individual component of MetS was found to be statistically significantly worsened by the completion of chemotherapy (P<.01). The individual MetS components
remained significant when adjusted for age, race, type/duration of chemotherapy, and BMI. The percentage changes
observed in components of MetS varied from 4.7% (waist
circumference) to 20.3% (blood glucose) over the approximately 4-month duration of chemotherapy. No statistically
significant differences were observed between premenopausal and postmenopausal patients (P>.01).
Pretreatment and posttreatment anthropometric
values are shown in Table 3. Before the initiation of chemotherapy, patients had a mean body weight of 69.2 kg
(617.1 kg) and a BMI of 25.9 kg/m2 (66.3 kg/m2).
Patients demonstrated a high percentage of body fat
(33.1%68.2%) despite the BMI classification of normaloverweight. Body weight, BMI, fat mass, and percentage
body fat were all found to be statistically significantly
higher after the completion of chemotherapy when compared with prechemotherapy values (P<.01). The mean

weight gain was 5.5 kg (617.4 kg). Lean body mass was
not found to be statistically significantly changed
(P>.05), whereas the mean percentage body fat increased
by 8.9%. Adverse changes in these anthropometric values
remained statistically significant when adjusted for age,
race, and type/duration of chemotherapy. The percentage
changes observed in anthropometrics varied from 1.8%
(hip circumference) to 30.3% (waist/hip ratio) over the
approximately 4-month duration of chemotherapy. No
statistically significant differences were observed between
premenopausal and postmenopausal patients (P>.01).
Metabolic biomarkers, including lipid profile, glucose metabolism, and inflammation before and after chemotherapy are shown in Table 4. It is interesting to note that
despite the exclusion of patients with diagnosed MetS or
elevated singular components of MetS at baseline, biomarkers of glucose metabolism, including fasting insulin
and HOMA-IR, were found to be clinically elevated before
treatment (18.9 mIU/mL and 4.52, respectively). Total
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HOMAIR, insulin, HbA1c, and CRP were found to be statistically
significantly higher after the completion of chemotherapy
when compared with prechemotherapy values (P<.05).
Furthermore, these changes in metabolic biomarkers
remained statistically significantly elevated when adjusted
for age, race, and type/duration of chemotherapy. The percentage changes in metabolic biomarkers observed varied
from 8.6% (HbA1c) to 108.3% (HOMA-IR) over the
approximately 4-month duration of chemotherapy. No
statistically significant differences were observed between
premenopausal and postmenopausal patients (P>.01).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the largest study to date to systematically address the effect of
2650

(neo)adjuvant chemotherapy alone on MetS and its components in both premenopausal and postmenopausal
women. Smaller studies have reported MetS or its components after the completion of all treatments for breast
cancer.3,16,17
Of critical importance in the current study is how
quickly metabolic changes occurred in patients with breast
cancer who were free from any serious comorbidities at
the time of diagnosis. Within 4 months, newly diagnosed
MetS occurred in >70% of the current study population.
In combination with the weight gain, hypercholesterolemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance that we also
observed, these patients are now susceptible to additional
health-related concerns, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer recurrence.
A significant number of women treated at the study
institution had at least 3 of the 5 criteria for MetS at the
time of diagnosis. We screened 963 patients, of whom
only 153 (16%) were eligible. This is by itself particularly
striking because MetS is recognized as negatively affecting
overall survival in patients with breast cancer.18-20 The
current study provides insight not only into the potential
metabolic changes after the completion of (neo)adjuvant
chemotherapy but also into the preexisting metabolic disturbances present at the time of chemotherapy initiation.
This emphasizes the need to focus research efforts on large
randomized controlled trials of modifiable lifestyle factors
such as body size, physical activity, and diet to offset these
metabolic disturbances and improve prognosis.21
Weight gain after treatment has been previously
reported by numerous investigators. Although others have
reported changes in weight at 1 year, we documented an
increase in body weight of approximately 8% (approximately 5 kg) at the time of the completion of chemotherapy. This surpasses the previously documented average of
Cancer

approximately 2 to 3 kg after chemotherapy.1,22 The
results of the current study indicated a significant increase
in waist circumference, averaging 90.7 cm after treatment,
indicating the development of or progression of central
obesity during the course of treatment, which may drive
the additional metabolic disturbances observed in the current study population.
One of the most interesting findings from the current study was the effect of chemotherapy on glucose metabolism. Fasting insulin increased by approximately 73%
and HOMA-IR more than doubled, increasing approximately 108% over the 4-month duration of the current
study. These are profound changes, yet it is interesting to
note that both insulin and HOMA-IR were elevated at
baseline (18.9 mIU/mL and 4.52, respectively). The duration of these disturbances in glucose metabolism before
diagnosis in the current study population is unknown, as
is their potential effect on carcinogenesis. Similar to the
current study, Guinan et al reported a significant increase
in fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c in 61 women
with breast cancer after adjuvant treatment, which
included chemotherapy, radiotherapy or anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed therapy
(ie, trastuzumab).3
Many investigations have followed glucose metabolism in patients with breast cancer at different time points
in the disease trajectory. Overall, elevated fasting insulin is
associated with distant disease recurrence and death in
patients with early-stage breast cancer,23 elevated insulin
levels are associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of
postmenopausal breast cancer,24 patients with a more
advanced stage of disease (stage II-IV) are more likely to
be hyperinsulinemic,11 and elevated HOMA-IR scores
are associated with reduced breast cancer survival and allcause survival.9 Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia in women
with breast cancer reflects the presence of insulin resistance, as indicated by a significant correlation of hyperinsulinemia with HOMA-IR.25 It is important to note that
although the index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)
more than doubled, the rise in HbA1c was marginal (an
8.6% change from baseline). The lack of a clinically significant change in HbA1c demonstrates its limited value
in assessing the degree of deterioration in glucose metabolism during weight gain; because of the capacity of beta
cells for insulin secretion and masking hyperglycemia, it
further increases the importance of using HOMA-IR or
other measures of insulin sensitivity in MetS rather than
HbA1c. Collectively, these observations support the need
to design interventions that target hyperinsulinemia
and insulin resistance in patients with breast cancer for
Cancer

long-term survivorship, perhaps by using metformin,
which lowers insulin and improves insulin resistance in
nondiabetic women with breast cancer.26,27
The current study also is unique in that it reported
CRP levels before and after chemotherapy in this population, which to our knowledge has not been previously
investigated. CRP is among the many circulating biomarkers of inflammation that have been evaluated as
potential mediators of the association between obesity
and cancer. CRP concentrations are elevated with obesity28 and insulin resistance,29 and may be an important
independent biomarker for long-term survival in survivors
of breast cancer.30-32 In the current study, a 32% increase
in CRP after chemotherapy was observed, suggesting an
increase in systemic inflammation. Previous studies have
characterized CRP levels at different time points in the
disease trajectory. CRP was found to be moderately to
severely elevated (5.165.3 mg/dL) in 91% of overweight
survivors of breast cancer (42 survivors) who were using
adjuvant hormone therapy33 and was found to be significantly elevated (5.064.2 mg/dL) in obese, insulinresistant survivors of breast cancer (18 survivors) when
compared with normal-weight, non-insulin-resistant survivors (19 survivors); obese, non-insulin-resistant survivors (16 survivors); or normal-weight, insulin-resistant
survivors of breast cancer (16 survivors).34 Collectively,
previous studies assessing CRP in patients with breast cancer indicated that CRP is an important link between
inflammation, prognosis, and metabolic presentation that
should be closely monitored throughout survivorship.
The lack of differences observed at baseline and after
chemotherapy among premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with breast cancer across all outcomes is
surprising based on previous literature that suggested that,
before the initiation of chemotherapy, premenopausal
patients are leaner, have a lower BMI, and have a smaller
waist circumference.35 Regardless, premenopausal
patients experience similar detrimental changes to metabolic dysfunction and anthropometrics as postmenopausal patients during adjuvant therapy.35 In fact, a recent
observational study noted greater increases in BMI in premenopausal patients compared with postmenopausal
patients after chemotherapy.36 It is possible that due to
the sedentary behavior of all of the patients in the current
study at baseline that they were similarly experiencing an
energy imbalance favoring weight gain and metabolic dysfunction that was exacerbated further by chemotherapy.
Long-term follow-up of the current study cohort would
allow for the examination of changes in metabolic dysfunction by menopausal status.

Potential mechanisms exist to explain the metabolic
deterioration after chemotherapy observed in the current
study. Weight gain may be one of the critical driving factors because the current study participants experienced,
on average, an approximately 8% gain in body weight, an
approximately 17% gain in fat mass, and an approximately 12% increase in BMI. Thus, a group with an overall normal BMI before chemotherapy was reclassified as
overweight/obese after chemotherapy. Waist circumference, which is used to characterize metabolically active,
visceral adipose tissue, increased by approximately 5%.
Visceral adipose tissue has been proposed to promote the
development of inflammation37 and insulin resistance.38,39 This could explain the increased insulin resistance observed in the population in the current study.
Overall, weight gain leading to obesity is associated with
elevated levels of glucose, TRI, and blood pressure, and
reduced HDL-C, thus predisposing women to MetS.40
The current study has limitations. First, we were
unable to capture self-reported dietary intake from the
patients. We initially set out to collect such information
from all of the participants before treatment, weekly during the course of treatment, and at the completion of
treatment to determine whether dietary habits had
changed. However, this task appeared to be too burdensome for the majority of study participants due to the
time and effort required to document dietary habits on a
weekly or even sporadic basis. We were able to collect dietary caloric intake for 7 of the 86 patients; among these
women, we observed no statistically significant change in
the average amount of calories consumed (data not
shown) from before the initiation of treatment to after its
completion. Second, although to the best of our knowledge the sample size in the current study is the largest to
date to study MetS, it is a small representation of patients
with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Third, despite our efforts to include a racially diverse population,
the current study sample did not include a large representation of Asian or African American patients. Fourth, our
original study protocol did not allow for an extended
follow-up period and therefore we do not know whether
the changes in components of MetS persisted over time or
if they resolved. We are currently in the process of incorporating a follow-up period to reexamine metabolic dysfunction at 1, 3, and 5 years after the completion of
chemotherapy. Last, the current study lacks a control
group with which to assess whether the patients would
have experienced these changes in the absence of
chemotherapy.

Conclusions

Patients with breast cancer who undergo (neo)adjuvant
chemotherapy experience an impaired metabolic presentation, as noted by worsened components of MetS,
anthropometrics, and biomarkers of glucose metabolism.
The findings of the current study contribute to the growing body of literature that suggests the need to strategize
appropriate interventions to offset these detrimental metabolic effects or, when possible, to initiate them as preventive measures before the start of treatment.
FUNDING SUPPORT
Supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (P30
CA33572 and K05 CA136967 [to Leslie Bernstein]). Additional
funding for the current study was provided by the Carr-Baird Family Fund through the Women’s Cancers Program at the City of
Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (to Christina M. DieliConwright).
