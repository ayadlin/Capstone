BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence has suggested that sustained adrenergic activation can promote ovarian cancer growth and metastasis. The authors examined the impact of beta-adrenergic blockade on the clinical outcome of women with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers (collectively, epithelial ovarian cancer [EOC]). METHODS: A multicenter review of 1425
women with histopathologically confirmed EOC was performed. Comparisons were made between patients with documented betablocker use during chemotherapy and those without beta-blocker use. RESULTS: The median age of patients in the current study was
63 years (range, 21-93 years). The sample included 269 patients who received beta-blockers. Of those, 193 (71.7%) were receiving
beta-1–adrenergic receptor selective agents, and the remaining patients were receiving nonselective beta antagonists. The primary indication for beta-blocker use was hypertension but also included arrhythmia and postmyocardial infarction management. For patients
receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival (OS) was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers (P 5.04). The median
OS based on beta-blocker receptor selectivity was 94.9 months for those receiving nonselective beta-blockers versus 38 months for
those receiving beta-1–adrenergic receptor selective agents (P<.001). Hypertension was associated with decreased OS compared
with no hypertension across all groups. However, even among patients with hypertension, a longer median OS was observed among
users of a nonselective beta-blocker compared with nonusers (38.2 months vs 90 months; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of nonselective beta-blockers in patients with EOC was associated with longer OS. These findings may have implications for new therapeutic

INTRODUCTION
The role of the adrenergic system in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) carcinogenesis makes it an attractive target for the
treatment of ovarian cancer. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction studies have demonstrated constitutive
expression of adrenergic receptors in the cell lines studied.1 Extensive preclinical data have firmly established that the activation of the receptors results in the growth and progression of ovarian cancer.1-4 In one study, norepinephrine and isoproterenol (an adrenergic agonist) significantly enhanced the production of vascular endothelial growth factor, which plays a
crucial role in angiogenesis.1 Propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker (NSBB), blocked the production of vascular endothelial growth factor.
In another in vitro study, norepinephrine and epinephrine (beta-adrenergic receptor agonists) were found to
increase the invasive potential of ovarian cancer cells, but this effect was abrogated by propranolol. Norepinephrine also
increased tumor cells’ expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)22 and MMP-9, and pharmacological blockade
of MMPs inhibited the effects of norepinephrine on the invasive potential of tumor cells.2 In an orthotopic mouse
model, daily restraint stress resulted in higher tissue catecholamine levels, greater tumor burden, and a more infiltrative

pattern of ovarian cancer. These effects were mediated
primarily through adrenergic receptor-b2 (ADRB2) activation of the protein kinase A signaling pathway.
Tumors in these stressed animals demonstrated increased
vascularization and enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, MMP-2, and MMP-9, effects
that could be reversed by propranolol.3
This extensive preclinical evidence that adrenergic
signaling promotes the growth of ovarian cancer, combined with similar clinical evidence for cancers in other
organs such as the breast, pancreas, and colon, suggests
that there could be clinical benefit in evaluating the use of
beta-blockers on survival in patients with ovarian cancer.4
There are several studies that have investigated the impact
of beta-blocker use. These studies have had conflicting
conclusions, which may be due, in part, to small patient
numbers. The lack of attention to beta-blocker selectivity
must also be considered as an explanation for the varying
results.5-7 At an in vitro level, the positive effects of beta
blockade on ovarian cancer rely on ADRB2 inhibition.
However, ADRB1-selective beta-blockers (SBBs) are
more commonly prescribed than NSBBs, and populations
with greater SBB use are unlikely to demonstrate a benefit
from their beta-blocker use.8 To examine the impact of
selective versus nonselective ADRB blockade on patient
survival, we conducted a multi-institutional retrospective
cohort study of women with newly diagnosed epithelial
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (collectively referred to as EOC).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

A multi-institutional retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients with EOC who were diagnosed and
treated with at least 1 cycle of platinum-based doublet
chemotherapy from 2000 to 2010 at 4 institutions (The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center [Houston, Tex], Washington University School of Medicine
[St. Louis, Mo], Mayo Clinic [Rochester, Minn], and
Mercy Medical Center [Baltimore, Md]). Institutional
Review Board approval was obtained at all participating
institutions. Patient charts, both electronic and paper,
were reviewed for demographic information, the presence
of hypertension or diabetes mellitus, tumor characteristics, cancer treatments, surgical outcome (optimal cytoreduction indicates <1 cm of residual disease), use of betablockers, and survival data. Use of beta-blockers was
defined as any documentation of beta-blocker use in the
medical record during neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(NACT) or adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of diagnosis to the
date of death from any cause that was confirmed by
patient chart or the Social Security Death Index. The OS
of patients with different prognostic factors was determined in addition to the OS effect of beta-blocker use.
Progression-free survival calculations were not conducted
due to all institutions not reporting these data, but
disease-specific survival modeling was performed.

Statistical Analysis

Patients were first evaluated using descriptive statistics to
summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of
the 2 groups: those who used beta-blockers and those who
did not. Fisher exact tests were used to compare groups
with respect to distribution of categorical data, and a 2sample Student t test was used to compare groups with
respect to the means for continuous data. If normality
assumptions for the Student t test were not met, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare
groups. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, OS was estimated for groups by beta-blocker use and type of betablocker used (SBB vs NSBB).9 Log-rank tests were conducted to examine differences by beta-blocker use and
type.10 Proportional hazards models were created using
the covariates listed in Tables 1 to 5 and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs) as well as P values were calculated.11 P
values <.05 were considered to be statistically significant;
P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS
Demographic and Disease Characteristics

From the 4 participating institutions, 1425 patients with
EOC were identified as being eligible for inclusion in the
current study. Demographic, disease, and treatment characteristics are shown in Table 1. Beta-blocker users were
older, had higher body mass indices (BMIs), and were
3446

more likely to have hypertension compared with nonusers. Greater than 90% of patients received upfront surgery
followed by ACT. Patients receiving NACT were more
likely to be receiving beta-blockers (P 5.005).
Prognostic Factors

Age, FIGO stage of disease, sequence of therapy, surgical
outcome, histology, BMI, tumor grade, and race were
evaluated for effect on OS for all patients. Older patients
(those aged >65 years) had a decreased OS rate (P<.001).
Patients with stage III or IV disease at the time of presentation were found to have a shorter median OS compared
with those presenting with stage I or II disease (P<.001).
Patients receiving NACT had decreased survival when
compared with those who underwent upfront surgery followed by chemotherapy (28.7 months vs 45.6 months;
P<.001). Optimal interval cytoreduction (<1 cm of residual disease) was associated with an increased median
OS for patients treated with NACT compared with
patients treated with NACT who had a suboptimal surgery (37.4 months vs 22.6 months; P 5 0.002). Patients
with serous histology who received ACT had a shorter median OS compared with those with nonserous histology
who received ACT (44.5 months vs 55.9 months; P
5.035). However, histology made no difference in OS for
those who received NACT (30.5 months vs 28.4 months;
P 5.51). BMI also was found to have no effect on OS

except among patients treated with NACT (P 5.024).
Race and tumor grade had no effect on OS.
The presence of comorbidities was also evaluated for
its effect on survival in the overall group. Hypertension
was associated with decreased survival compared with normal blood pressure (40.1 months vs 47.4 months;
P<.001). Diabetes mellitus appeared to have no significant effect on OS (39.8 months vs 43.4 months; P
5.503).
Disease-Specific Survival by Beta-Blocker Use

Because progression-free survival data were not available
from all sites, models were created to examine diseasespecific survival (DSS) based on any use of beta-blockers
(Table 2) and specific types of beta-blockers (Table 3).
During the first year, patients who used any type of betablocker had improved DSS regardless of whether they had
hypertension compared with nonusers (P<.0001). By the
fifth year, patients who received SBB and had hypertension had a statistically significant increase in diseasespecific mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% CI,
1.23-2.18 [P 5.0007]). Patients who took SBBs and did
not have hypertension had no difference in diseasespecific mortality. Patients treated with NSBB continued
to have improved DSS regardless of whether they had

hypertension, but they fared especially well if they had no
hypertension (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.53 [P<.0001]).
OS by Beta-Blocker Use

The influence of beta-blocker use on OS in all patients
was examined alone and in relation to the presence of
comorbidities, and the results are outlined in Table 4.
Proportional hazards models stratified by institution were
created using the covariates shown in Table 1. A test of
the proportional hazards assumption indicated that this
was violated for beta-blocker use and optimal cytoreduction. Therefore, cytoreduction was included in the model
as a stratification factor and an interaction term for betablocker use by the natural log of time was included in the
model to adjust for these violations. Beta-blocker use of
any kind was associated with a longer median OS than
nonuse (47.8 months vs 42 months; P 5.036). When further classifying patients based on beta-blocker selectivity
(SBB vs NSBB), no difference in the median OS was
observed between SBB users and nonusers (38 months vs
42 months; P 5.196). However, patients receiving NSBB
had a longer median OS than nonusers (94.9 months vs
42 months; P<.001). Because optimal cytoreduction is a
known prognostic factor for survival and differed between
the patients treated with SBBs (69.9%) and those treated

with NSBBs (79.7%), this finding was analyzed and the
importance of taking any type of beta-blocker with the
use of optimal or suboptimal cytoreduction remained in
the first year except for patients with SBB and hypertension, as shown in Table 5. By year 5, only NSBB conferred
a benefit to women without hypertension who underwent
optimal cytoreduction (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.98 [P
5 .046]) and those who underwent suboptimal cytoreduction (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17-0.45 [P<.0001]).
Additional comparisons were made based on beta-blocker
use and sequence of chemotherapy (NACT vs ACT).
Beta-blockers users had an OS benefit compared with
nonusers, regardless of whether they underwent upfront
cytoreductive surgery followed by ACT (49.9 months vs

months vs 26.3 months; P 5.048).
OS by Beta-Blocker Use and Comorbidities

Patients without diabetes had a significantly longer median OS if they received an NSBB compared with nonusers of beta-blockers (94.9 months vs 42.4 months;
P<.001) and a nonsignificant decrease in median OS if
an SBB was used (38.2 months) (Table 4). Among
patients with diabetes, NSBB users had a significant
increase in their median OS compared with SBB users
(Table 4).

Among beta-blocker users, the presence of hypertension had no significant effect on the median OS compared
with patients with normal blood pressure (49 months vs
42.8 months; P 5.54). Among patients without hypertension, those who received an SBB had a shorter median
OS compared with those who did not use beta-blockers
(33.4 months vs 47.9 months; P 5.003). The median OS
of normotensive NSBB users (112 months; P 5.057) was
not statistically significant compared with that of nonusers (Table 4), but when compared with SBB users with
normal blood pressure a significant improvement was
observed (33.4 months vs 112 months; P 5.001). The
OS improvement for normotensive NSBB users compared with nonusers represented the largest numerical difference in median OS (64.1 months).
For hypertensive patients, any beta-blocker use was
associated with a longer median OS compared with nonusers (49 months vs 34.2 months; P<.001). Hypertensive
patients receiving SBBs had a longer OS than nonusers
(38.2 months vs 34.2 months; P 5.007). However,
NSBB users were observed to have a longer median OS
(90 months; P<.001) than either users of SBBs or nonusers with elevated blood pressure (Fig. 1). Hypertension
appeared to have no statistically significant effect on OS
in patients treated with ACT using beta-blockers (39.6
months vs 50.4 months; P 5.517). Among patients

treated with NACT who did not receive beta-blockers,
those with hypertension had a shorter median OS compared with normotensive patients (19.7 months vs 30.5
months; P<.001). This negative effect of hypertension on
OS was not observed in the patients treated with NACT
who were being treated with beta-blockers (37.9 months
vs 42.8 months; P 5.80).
DISCUSSION
The prolonged OS of patients with EOC who are receiving beta-blockers, especially NSBB, is an important finding, and to our knowledge the current study is the first to
demonstrate an OS benefit in relation to beta-blocker selectivity in these patients. The ability to improve the survival of patients with EOC via ADRB2 blockade using
beta-blockers would be the culmination of years of
research into the biology and pathogenesis of EOC. Particularly interesting is the finding that beta-blocker users
in the current study presented at a higher stage of disease,
had an increased average BMI, and were more likely to be
hypertensive. All these factors were associated with
decreased survival, yet those who received beta-blockers
had either equivalent or improved OS. Further examinaCancer

tion revealed that NSBB users had improved OS regardless of the presence of prognostic factors or comorbidities
shown to decrease OS. This was not true for patients who
took SBBs; in some cases, a decreased OS was observed.
Although further study is needed, these results highlight
the importance of ADRB2 in ovarian carcinogenesis and
the usefulness of NSBB.
The current study is limited by its retrospective
design and the resulting inability to document the duration of beta-blocker use and dosages used by patients with
EOC. Although it would be ideal to have better documentation of beta-blocker use in the current study population,
the finding that improvement was noted in patients who
used beta-blockers for any duration at any dose during
their chemotherapy is promising. The validity of the current study findings is improved due to the study being
multi-institutional with a large cohort of patients with
EOC. Most importantly, the stratification of patients by
beta-blocker use and selectivity makes it unique among all
other studies examining the impact of the use of betablockers among patients with ovarian cancer.5-7,12

survival or OS between patients with EOC who did or did
not use beta-blockers.6 Similarly, when Johannesdottir
et al stratified the Danish Cancer Registry of >6000
patients with ovarian cancer by current (90 days), past
(>90 days), and never-use of beta-blockers, the authors
found no difference in all-cause mortality.7 To the best of
our knowledge, none of these studies reported on the selectivity of the beta-blockers used. A multi-institutional
European study that evaluated the impact of beta-blocker
use in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent EOC
did report the selectivity of beta-blockers used (approximately 10% of their population were receiving betablockers and of those, only 1.5% were receiving an
NSBB), but did not stratify survival outcomes by betablocker selectivity.12 Without stratification for betablocker selectivity, direct comparison of these conflicting
results is difficult. In vitro studies have shown that it is
specifically ADRB2 stimulation that contributes to ovarian cancer development and metastasis.2-4,13 This is supported by the improvements in OS noted among patients
receiving NSBB compared with those taking any betablocker. More telling is the finding that in some cases,
patients taking an SBB had worsened survival. It is unclear
why those taking SBB fared worse than those not taking
beta-blockers, but it could be related to the increased age,
higher median BMI, and presence of comorbidities in
that group. Whether SBBs independently result in
decreased OS will require further investigation. These
results showcase the importance of ADRb2 in EOC
3450

pathogenesis and the potential for NSBBs to improve outcomes in all patients with EOC. Thus, it is necessary to
stratify patients based on beta-blocker selectivity in future
studies so that we may best understand how to incorporate
NSBB into treatment to improve the outcomes of individual patients.
In studies examining the effects of beta-blockers on
survival in patients with breast, lung, or ovarian cancer or
melanoma, patients were taking beta-blockers for cardiac
or other clinical indications and not for cancer therapy.57,12,14,15
However, with mounting evidence of the potential impact of beta-blockers on the outcomes of patients
with cancer, a prospective clinical trial is warranted to
identify those patients who would benefit most from betablocker use and to identify the best beta-blocker for a specific tumor type based on adrenergic receptor expression.
Tumor cell expression of ADRB could be used as a biomarker for selecting those patients who would benefit
from a specific beta-blocker. Beta-blockers could then be
used as an adjuvant therapy during surgical recovery and
chemotherapy to decrease tumor angiogenesis, tumor
growth, delays in wound healing, and metastasis.15,16
Beta-blockers also may reduce cancer-related psychological distress in patients newly diagnosed with cancer.15
Therefore, beta-blockers have the potential to impact not
only cancer biology and immunology but also the psychological well-being of patients with cancer.
Because the biological effects and recommended
dosing schedules of beta-blockers for hypertension are
well known, adding these drugs to ACT should be relatively easy. However, beta-blockers are degraded by the
enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6, and understanding of the
activity of this enzyme may play a key role in identifying
doses that are likely to have maximal clinical benefit. Several genetic polymorphisms in this gene exist, and variations in drug sensitivity that result from these
polymorphisms may determine the individual pharmacokinetics for each patient to allow for dose optimization.15
There are currently 2 clinical trials that are evaluating the combination of chemotherapy and variable doses
of propranolol on cancer biology as well as the effect of
NSBBs on stress modulators in patients newly diagnosed
with EOC.18,19 The preliminary data from these feasibility trials will help us to design adequately powered, prospective, randomized clinical trials to determine whether
NSBBs can improve outcomes for patients with EOC.
