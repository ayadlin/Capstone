ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death throughout the
world. Despite improved screening efforts, most CRCs are diagnosed at late stages
when surgery alone is not curative. Moreover, the low 5-year survival rate (~813%) for those living with stage IV CRC highlights the need for better treatment
options. Many current chemotherapeutic approaches are non-specific and associated
with side effects due to their tendency to target both normal and cancer cells. To
address this issue, synthetic lethal (SL) approaches are now being explored in cancer
and are defined as the lethal combination of two independently viable mutations/
deletions. From a therapeutic perspective, SL interactors of genes mutated in cancer
serve as candidate drug targets. The present study focuses on RAD54B, a gene that
is aberrantly expressed in many cancer types, including CRC. We show that PARP1
silencing or inhibition (BMN673 or Olaparib) leads to selective killing within RAD54Bdeficient cells relative to controls, and is accompanied by increases in g-H2AX (a
surrogate marker of DNA double strand breaks) and cleaved Caspase-3 (an apoptotic
indicator). We further show that BMN673 synergizes with LCS-1 (an inhibitor of an
established RAD54B SL interactor) to induce enhanced killing in RAD54B-deficient
cells. Collectively, these data identify RAD54B and PARP1 as SL interactors, and thus
reveal PARP1 as a novel candidate drug target in RAD54B-deficient CRCs. These
findings further show that combinatorial chemotherapies involving multiple SL targets
may promote synergistic killing within cancer cells, a strategy that may hold potential
in many cancer contexts.

approaches are designed to exploit the aberrant genetics
driving tumorigenesis, they are expected to better restrict
their therapeutic effects to cancer cells than traditional
approaches. Thus, identifying SL interactors of genes
somatically altered in CRC will identify candidate drug
targets with the potential to exploit and target cancer using
a precision medicine strategy.
Recent gene re-sequencing efforts have identified
numerous somatic mutations and deletions in genes
encoding functions within the DNA damage response
(DDR) [4] that are ideal targets to exploit via a SL
paradigm. Disruption of the DDR correlates with genome
instability [5], which accelerates the acquisition of
subsequent mutations and/or gene copy number changes,
and is a hallmark of virtually all cancer types [6, 7]. For
example, RAD54B is somatically mutated or deleted in

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause
of cancer-related deaths in North America. In 2015, it was
estimated that ~160,000 Americans and Canadians were
newly diagnosed with CRC, with an additional ~60,000
individuals ultimately succumbing to the disease [1, 2].
Based on these statistics it is evident that new therapeutic
strategies are urgently needed to minimize the morbidity
and mortality rates associated with the disease. Synthetic
lethality is one such strategy and is defined as a rare
and lethal combination of two independently viable
mutations [3]. In a CRC context, a synthetic lethal (SL)
approach aims to exploit a pre-existing gene deletion
or mutation (e.g. RAD54B) in a cancer cell by down
regulating a SL interactor (i.e. drug target). Since SL

numerous cancer types, including CRC (~3.3%) [8], breast
(~3.4%) [9], lung (~2.6%) [10], which represents ~20,500
North Americans each year who are newly diagnosed
with these three cancers alone [1, 2]. RAD54B encodes a
protein that functions in DDR, specifically within the DNA
double strand break (DSB) repair pathway. In particular,
RAD54B functions in homologous recombination repair
(HRR) [11–14], which is commonly referred to as an
‘error-free’ repair pathway [11]. RAD54B is a member of
the SWI/SNF2 helicase superfamily, and hydrolyses ATP
to remodel protein-duplex DNA complexes to enhance
the accessibility of chromatin to repair factors [15, 16].
RAD54B is also proposed to be an accessory factor for
RAD51, that assists in HRR specifically during strand
invasion into the undamaged sister chromatid [13, 17, 18].
Beyond HRR, RAD54B is also a chromosome instability
(CIN) gene, as diminished expression induces CIN, or
aberrant chromosome numbers [19]. Collectively, these
data suggest diminished RAD54B expression and/or
function are pathogenic events in the development and
progression of cancer [20]. Importantly, these data suggest
RAD54B may harbor tumor suppressor-like properties
[19] rendering it an attractive target to exploit via a SL
approach.
Although the clinical applicability of SL approaches
is still in its infancy, numerous research groups have
begun to uncover SL interactors (i.e. drug targets) for a
myriad of genes somatically altered in cancer [21–23]. In
fact, three SL interactors for RAD54B have already been
identified and include Flap Endonuclease-1 (FEN1) [19],
Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) [24], and DNA Ligase
IV (LIG4) [25]. Collectively, these SL interactions rely
on the synergistic killing of RAD54B-deficient CRC cells
following the silencing or inhibition of a SL interactor
that functions within the DDR (e.g. FEN1, SOD1, LIG4).
These observations suggest that additional members of
the DDR family may also be SL with RAD54B, including
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). In 2005, two
seminal studies identified PARP as novel drug target and
SL interactor of BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are commonly
mutated in breast and ovarian cancers [19, 20]. Since
then, subsequent studies have uncovered a number of
additional SL interactions involving PARP1 [19, 24, 26].
In particular, two high-throughput screens demonstrated
that PARP1 was SL with a large number of DDR genes
including CDK12, DDB1, XAB2, however RAD54B was
never identified [27, 28]. Due to the involvement of
RAD54B within the DDR, we predicted PARP1 would
also be SL with RAD54B.
In this study, we couple siRNA-based silencing
and small molecule inhibitors with semi-quantitative
imaging microscopy, real time cell analyses (RTCA), and
biochemical assays, and show that RAD54B and PARP1
are SL. We show that RAD54B-deficient CRC cells are
preferentially killed following PARP1 silencing and
inhibition with BMN673 and Olaparib. More specifically,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we demonstrate that BMN673 and Olaparib treatments
induce increases in γ-H2AX (a surrogate marker for
DNA DSBs) preferentially within RAD54B-deficient cells
and induce cytotoxicity via apoptosis. To enhance the
therapeutic effects observed following PARP inhibition,
we explored combinatorial treatments involving BMN673
with either 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an established nonspecific chemotherapeutic, or, LCS-1, an inhibitor of
SOD1, a previously established SL interactor of RAD54B
[29]. Although the combination involving 5-FU showed
little enhanced effect beyond simple additivity, the
combination involving LCS-1 induced synergistic killing
within RAD54B-deficient cells. Collectively, our data
show that RAD54B and PARP1 are SL, and add RAD54B
to the growing list of genes that can be therapeutically
exploited with PARP inhibitors. Finally, our data also
show that combinatorial approaches involving multiple SL
targets can provide synergistic killing within CRC cells,
and further suggest this combinatorial strategy may hold
potential in other cancer contexts.

RESULTS
RAD54B and PARP1 are synthetic lethal
interactors
Previous genetic studies have shown that a number
of genes encoding functions within the DDR, particularly
HRR, are SL with PARP1 [27, 30–34]. Since a large
number of genetic studies show that members of the
same biological pathway frequently share SL interactors
[19, 24, 26], we postulated PARP1 would also be SL with
RAD54B, as it also encodes functions within HRR [9,
35–37]. However, we first began by confirming RAD54B
expression within the RAD54B-proficient (control) and
RAD54B-deficient isogenic cell model (Figure 1A), and
subsequently assessed four individual PARP1 siRNA
duplexes to identify the two most efficient silencers,
siPARP1-1 and siPARP1-2 (Figure 1B). Next, we queried
whether PARP1 silencing induced preferential killing
within the RAD54B-deficient cells relative to controls. The
RAD54B isogenic model has been employed previously in
similar siRNA-based SL studies [19, 24], and following
silencing of a candidate interactor (e.g. PARP1) a decrease
in the number of RAD54B-deficient cells relative to
controls is suggestive of a SL interaction. Accordingly,
cells were transfected with siRNAs, permitted to grow
for ~3.5 days, whereupon cells were fixed, imaged and
analyzed. Following silencing, the relative percentage
of RAD54B-deficient cells remaining was significantly
reduced relative to controls (Figure 1C). In fact, the
siRNA-Pool and both individual siRNAs induced
statistically significant decreases in RAD54B-deficient
cells (Table S1), suggesting RAD54B and PARP1 are SL.
Indeed, further scrutiny of the images revealed a subset of
RAD54B-deficient cells exhibiting cytological hallmarks

fixed within the RAD54B-deficient cells that accounts for
putative RAD54B PARP1 SL interaction. To alleviate this
possibility, dual silencing experiments were performed in
which both RAD54B and PARP1 were either individually
or simultaneously silenced within the parental RAD54Bproficient (control) cells. However, we first confirmed
our ability to silence RAD54B [24] (Figure S1). Next,
single (siRAD54B or siPARP1) and dual (siRAD54B
plus siPARP1) siRNA experiments were performed and

of cytotoxicity that are typical of apoptosis, including
chromatin condensation and nuclear blebbing.
Although the above data imply RAD54B and
PARP1 are SL, it remains possible that the interaction
results from a de novo background mutation that arose
while generating the RAD54B-deficient cells. Since
HCT116 cells are MLH1-deficient (i.e. mis-match repair
defective) and mutations can accrue, the possibility
remained that an additional mutation became clonally

as predicted, the simultaneous silencing of RAD54B and
PARP1 induced a synergistic decrease in cell numbers
compared to silencing either gene alone (Figure 1D), or
that predicted using a multiplicative model (Table S2).
Collectively, the above data show that RAD54B and
PARP1 are SL within HCT116 cells, and further identify
PARP1 as a candidate drug target in a RAD54B-deficient
CRC context.

(identified by a cell index plateau) or cellular cytotoxicity
(identified as by either a change in slope [decrease] or
rapid decline in cell index) were induced following
treatments. RTCA employs electrical impedance as a
measure of cellular proliferation and can easily discern
cell cycle arrests (stationary phase identified by a plateau)
from cell cytotoxicity [24, 38]. Figure 3 shows that the
proliferation curves generated for the control cells are
largely overlapping and virtually indistinguishable
irrespective of treatment (DMSO, BMN673 or Olaparib).
In contrast however, the proliferation curves are
strikingly different within the RAD54B-deficient cells
treated with BMN673 or Olaparib relative to vehicle
control (DMSO), and are also suggestive of proliferation
defects (PDs) rather than cell cycle arrests. For example,
BMN673 treatment (Figure 3A) induces a rapid decline
in cell index ~40 h post-treatment within the RAD54Bdeficient cells, while Olaparib treatment (Figure 3B)
decreases proliferation as evidenced by a flattening of
the slope during the exponential growth phase. The
calculated PDs (Table S7) revealed a 94.2-fold and a
10.4-fold increase in mean PD within the RAD54Bdeficient cells treated with BMN673 (Figure 3C) or
Olaparib (Figure 3D), respectively. These data are in
agreement with the previous section, and show BMN673
and Olaparib treatments induce PDs rather than cell cycle
arrests.

RAD54B-deficient HCT116 cells are
hypersensitive to BMN673 and Olaparib
Next, we wished to determine whether two PARP
inhibitors, BMN673 and Olaparib, could functionally
substitute for PARP1 silencing and induce preferential
killing within the RAD54B-deficient cells. To begin,
standard dose response curves were generated and
revealed the RAD54B-deficient cells are hypersensitive to
both inhibitors relative to controls. More specifically, the
EC50 for BMN673 was 1.9-fold lower within the RAD54Bdeficient cells (9.0 nM) than the control (17.5 nM), while
for Olaparib it was 1.25-fold lower within the RAD54Bdeficient cells (2.82 μM) relative to controls (3.53
μM). Subsequent Student’s t-tests revealed statistically
significant decreases in RAD54B-deficient cells following
both BMN673 (Figure 2A; Table S3) and Olaparib (Figure
2B; Table S4) treatments. Thus, these data support those
of the previous section, and further suggest BMN673
and Olaparib are chemogenetic (i.e. SL) interactors of
RAD54B.
To confirm the above observations and validate
BMN673 and Olaparib as chemogenetic interactors
of RAD54B, mCFAs were performed. To best restrict
the therapeutic effect to the RAD54B-deficient cells,
the EC50 values calculated for BMN673 (9.0 nM) and
Olaparib (2.8 μM) were employed in all subsequent
work. Briefly, RAD54B-deficient and control cells were
treated with compounds for 7 days and cellular confluency
was quantitatively assessed. In agreement with the dose
response curves, BMN673 and Olaparib treatments
induced statistically significant decreases in confluency
within the RAD54B-deficient cells relative to controls
(Figure 2C and 2D). More specifically, BMN673 and
Olaparib induced 1.9- and 2.7-fold decreases, respectively,
within the RAD54B-deficient cells (Tables S5 & S6).
These data confirm RAD54B and PARP1 are SL and
further identify BMN673 and Olaparib as lead therapeutic
candidates warranting further pre-clinical investigation.

BMN673 and Olaparib treatments underlie
increases in γ-H2AX and apoptosis in RAD54Bdeficient cells
Several research groups have shown that PARP
inhibition induces DNA single strand breaks that are
converted into DNA DSBs within HRR compromised
cells to induce cell death [39, 40], while others have
shown excessive DSBs can induce apoptosis [41]. To
determine whether DSBs and apoptosis contribute to the
PDs described above, we employed semi-quantitative,
immunofluorescent microscopy [24] and quantified the
global abundance of key indicators of DSBs (γ-H2AX [42])
and apoptosis (cleaved Caspase-3 [43]). We first established
our ability to detect changes in γ-H2AX signal intensities
(Figure 4A) using ionizing radiation (IR) as a positive
control, and as expected, similar increases in γ-H2AX
signal intensities occurred within both cell lines (Figure
4B). Interestingly however, although increases in the mean
γ-H2AX signal intensities occurred in both lines following
BMN673 and Olaparib treatments, the mean γ-H2AX
signal intensities were consistently higher within the
RAD54B-deficient cells (Figure 4B) suggesting increases in
DNA DSBs occur preferentially within RAD54B-deficient
cells. In fact, Student’s t-tests revealed significant increases
in mean γ-H2AX signal intensities within the RAD54Bdeficient cells treated with either BMN673 (1.2-fold) or
Olaparib (1.3-fold) relative to controls (Table S8).

BMN673 and Olaparib treatments induce
proliferation defects in RAD54B-deficient cells
Having established RAD54B-deficient cells are
hypersensitive to both PARP inhibitors, we next sought
to determine the underlying mechanism accounting for
the decrease in cell numbers. Accordingly, RTCA was
performed to distinguish whether cell cycle arrests

significant increase in the proportion of RAD54Bdeficient cells labeled with cleaved Caspase-3 following
BMN673 (1.4-fold) and Olaparib (3.0-fold) treatments
relative to controls (Table S9). Collectively, these
data show there is an increase in both DNA DSBs
and apoptosis following PARP inhibition in RAD54Bdeficient cells, that likely accounts for the decrease in
cells numbers remaining following treatments.

Having established that BMN673 and Olaparib
treatments preferentially induce increases in a surrogate
marker for DNA DSBs in RAD54B-deficient cells, we
now wished to determine whether it was associated
with increases in apoptosis, as identified by cleaved
Caspase-3 signal intensity. Accordingly, quantitative
microscopy was performed and the percentage of
cells labeled with cleaved Caspase-3 was determined,
with Staurosporine serving as the positive control. As
shown in Figure 4C, there is a small albeit statistically

BMN673 and LCS-1 synergize to enhance
RAD54B-deficient cell killing

Accordingly, we performed both single and dual agent
dose response experiments involving BMN673 and LCS1, a recently identified SOD1 inhibitor [44]. As a control,
we included 5-FU, a classical frontline drug frequently
employed in combinatorial approaches in CRC [45] that
does not induce SL killing in RAD54B-deficient cells.
Based on Combenefit analyses, the BMN673 plus 5-FU
combination showed no synergy and was merely additive
(Figure 5A). In stark contrast however, the BMN673 plus
LCS-1 combination induced synergistic killing (Figure

Recognizing the limited therapeutic potential
of targeting PARP1 alone in RAD54B-deficient cells,
we wished to identify drug combinations that would
exacerbate the SL effect observed with BMN673. We
hypothesized that combinations involving inhibitors of
known SL interactors, like SOD1 [24], would produce
synergistic killing within RAD54B-deficient cells.

5B) that was readily apparent at concentrations ranging
from 2.25-36.0 nM (BMN673) and 0.75 μM (LCS-1).
Next, we performed modified colony formation
assays (mCFAs) to extend the above findings and
confirm the simultaneous administration of BMN673 and
LCS-1 induces synergistic killing within the RAD54Bdeficient cells. As shown in Figure 5C, the combination
involving BMN673 plus 5-FU induced growth defects
within RAD54B-deficient cells (60.3% confluent relative
to DMSO treatment), but to approximately the extent
predicted using a multiplicative model (68.7%). This
represents a relatively small ~12.2% difference between
expected and observed values (Table S10), and supports
the Combenefit findings above, suggesting an additive
interaction. Interestingly however, the combination
involving BMN673 and LCS-1 produced a large decrease
in relative cell confluency beyond that predicted using
the multiplicative model (Figure 5C). More specifically,
the predicted (70.0%) and observed (5.0%) confluency
for RAD54B-deficient cells represents a 92.8% difference
(Table S11) and strongly indicates the BMN673 and LCS-1
combination is synergistic within RAD54B-deficient cells.

inhibitors have garnered substantial attention as novel
compounds for precision medicine based approaches in
the fight against cancer. In 2014, Olaparib was approved as
a mono-therapy for maintenance in women with BRCA1/2
mutant, platinum-responsive, high-grade serous ovarian
cancer [46]. Moreover, since the original discovery
significant research efforts have focused on expanding the
number of chemogenetic interactions involving Olaparib
and other PARP inhibitors. In 2014 for example, Bajrami et
al [27] performed a genome-wide, shRNA drop-out screen
to identify novel chemogenetic interactors of Olaparib.
Although this screen confirmed several established
PARP1 interactors (BRCA1, RAD51, and FANCC) and
identified many novel interactions, it did not confirm
several established interactors (e.g. BRCA2 and DSS1)
nor did it identify RAD54B as a SL interactor. The authors
suggested that they were unable to confirm the established
interactions due to inadequate silencing, which may also
account for why RAD54B was not previously identified.
Independent of this work, many research laboratories have
sought to expand the number of chemogenetic interactors
of PARP inhibitors. Influenced heavily by the initial
observations involving BRCA1/ 2, a number of studies
focused on HRR (or DDR) genes as putative interactors.
Indeed, many of the identified interactors encode functions
within HRR (or DDR) including RAD54L [27], NBS [27,
30], RAD51 [27, 30], RAD51C [27, 31], RAD51D [27,
32], MRE11A [33], XRCC1 [34], XRCC2 [27], ATR [30],
ATM [30], DSS1 [30], FANCC [30] and CHEK2 [30], and
were identified through a combination of high-throughput
screens [27, 28] and direct tests [30–33]. Thus, through
direct tests, we have expanded this list to include RAD54B.
Although the clinical applicability of PARP
inhibitors is still in its infancy, mechanisms of PARP
inhibitor resistance have been identified. For instance,
Olaparib resistance was conferred in BRCA2-deficient
cancers harboring frame-shift mutations through
subsequent mutations that restored the BRCA2 reading
frame to effectively/partially rescue the HRR defect
[47]. Thus, a major avenue of scientific inquiry now
focuses on identifying and predicting the mechanisms
of drug resistance in the hopes of identifying additional
drug targets that will prevent the resistance mechanism.
A major limitation of many current cancer therapies
is the risk of developing resistant disease following
multiple courses with a particular drug resulting from
the selection of a pre-existing resistant clone or the
development of a resistant clone within the tumor.
It has been suggested that disease recurrence and
resistance may be minimized or avoided through the
use of combinatorial chemotherapeutic approaches
rather than sequential application of single agents
[48, 49]. Conceptually, combinatorial approaches
may target more cells within the tumor, thus reducing
the potential for selection and/or development of
resistant clones. In oncogenic addiction for example,

DISCUSSION
To expand the number of drug targets of RAD54B
and simultaneously assess the broad-spectrum applicability
of PARP1 as a candidate drug target, we evaluated the
ability of PARP1 silencing and inhibition to induce
SL killing in RAD54B-deficient CRC cells. Using an
isogenic RAD54B model, we show that PARP1 silencing
preferentially reduces the number of RAD54B-deficient
cells relative to controls. We further show that two PARP
inhibitors, BMN673 and Olaparib, can functionally
substitute for PARP1 silencing by inducing a decrease in
RAD54B-deficient cells relative to controls in both short
(<4 days) and longer-term assays (<7 days). We further
show that BMN673 and Olaparib treatments induce PDs in
RAD54B-deficient cells that are accompanied by increases
in γ-H2AX and cleaved Caspase-3, which are suggestive
of increases in DNA DSBs and apoptosis, respectively.
Collectively, these data confirm that RAD54B and PARP1
are SL. Finally, to enhance the potential therapeutic utility
and effect of PARP inhibitors, we explored combinatorial
approaches involving BMN673 and either 5-FU or LCS1. Here, we show that combining LCS-1, but not 5-FU,
with BMN673 induced synergistic killing within RAD54Bdeficient cells. Thus, this study identifies and validates
PARP1 as a candidate drug target in RAD54B-deficient
CRC cells, and identifies BMN673 and Olaparib as
novel candidate chemotherapeutic agents in a RAD54Bspecific CRC context. The results also support further
preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy of combinatorial
approaches involving BMN673 and LCS-1.

drug resistance can occur as a result of redundant
biological pathways or the compensatory activity of a
secondary pathway that circumnavigates the inhibitory
activity of a drug to ultimately activate the downstream
components of the oncogenic pathway. Consequently,
combinatorial approaches that simultaneously target
multiple biological pathways may negate or minimize
this possibility and/or induce toxicity in more cells to
prevent resistance from developing.
Combinatorial drug strategies beyond preventing
drug resistance may also improve the overall treatment
efficacy relative to single agents by producing more
extensive and robust killing of cancer cells within
a tumor. For example, identifying synergistic drug
combinations that produce therapeutic effects that
are greater than the sum of the two individual agents
alone would be highly beneficial. In the current study,
we determined BMN673 in combination with LCS-1
induces synergistic killing within RAD54B-deficient
cells, whereas BMN673 with 5-FU was only additive.
Thus, these findings suggest that generalized DNA
damage may be insufficient to synergize with PARP1
inhibition, but rather, synergy may depend on the
particular mechanism of DNA damage induction and
the particular proteins or factors involved. Importantly,
these results demonstrate how chemotherapeutic agents
targeting different SL pathways may be strategically
combined to enhance the overall SL effect. The same
theoretical strategy could be applied to other SL targets
and in CRC and other cancer types to more efficiently
target and kill cancer cells.
As we approach the era of precision medicine,
identifying SL interactors and synergistic drug
combinations may represent superior therapeutic
strategies to traditional approaches that tend to
indiscriminately target all replicating cells, including
cancer and normal. Thus, a major goal of the current
study was to determine whether PARP1 was a SL
interactor of an additional gene involved in HRR. Indeed,
we showed that PARP1 is SL with RAD54B, and further
determined that BMN673 and Olaparib are capable of
exploiting a RAD54B-deficiency in a CRC context. We
further evaluated the efficacy of BMN673 in combination
with other chemotherapeutic agents, and identified a
drug combination (BMN673 plus LCS-1) that induces
synergistic killing in 2D cell culture models. Thus,
these initial studies may serve as the underpinning for
subsequent preclinical work aimed at evaluating the
efficacy of these agents within more complex systems,
such as animal models. Additionally, these findings
serve as a proof of concept in support of combinatorial
chemotherapies involving multiple SL targets for a single
gene altered in cancer. Thus, expanding SL networks
in general and extending these strategies to include
additional cancer types may hold clinical potential within
the broader context of anti-cancer therapies.

Cell culture
HCT116 (RAD54B-proficient) cells were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection. RAD54Bdeficient HCT116 cells were generously provided by
K. Miyagawa (Hiroshima University, Japan) and were
generated by targeted integration and disruption of the
RAD54B locus [11]. All HCT116 cells were grown in
McCoy’s 5A medium (HyClone) supplemented with
10% FBS, and RAD54B expression was confirmed by
Western blot (Figure 1A). Cell lines were authenticated
on the basis of recovery, viability, growth and morphology,
and spectral karyotyping. All cells were grown in a 37°C
humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.

Gene silencing
Cells were transiently transfected with siRNA
duplexes using RNAiMax (Invitrogen) as detailed
elsewhere [19, 24]. ON-TARGETplus (Dharmacon)
siRNA duplexes targeting RAD54B, PARP1, GAPDH
and PLK1 were employed as either individual duplexes
or pools (four distinct duplexes targeting the gene of
interest), as detailed previously [19, 24]. Gene silencing
was confirmed by Western blot.

Western blotting
Western blots were performed as detailed elsewhere
[19] and blotted with RAD54B (1:1000; provided by Dr.
K. Miyagawa), PARP1 (Abcam ab6079; 1:7500), and
α-tubulin (Abcam ab7291; 1:20,000) antibodies. Semiquantitative analyses were employed to evaluate silencing
efficiencies using the Gel Analyzer Tool in ImageJ. All
data were normalized to the corresponding loading control
(α-tubulin) and are presented relative to the negative
control (siGAPDH).

Direct SL tests
High-content microscopy was used to evaluate the
SL interaction as detailed elsewhere [19, 24]. Briefly,
4000 RAD54B-proficient or RAD54B-deficient HCT116
cells were seeded into 96-well optical plates. Cells were
transfected in sextuplet (i.e. 6 wells per plate) with either
individual or pooled siRNAs targeting RAD54B, PARP1,
and controls (GAPDH and PLK1). GAPDH serves as a
negative control [19], while PLK1 is a positive control
for cell death independent of any SL interaction [50]
and also serves as a transfection efficiency indicator.
Wells were supplemented with 100 μL of media 24
hour (h) post-transfection, and permitted to grow for an
additional 3.5 days, following which cells were fixed
(4% paraformaldehyde), and counterstained with Hoechst
33342 (300 ng/mL; Thermo Scientific). Images were

Modified two dimensional colony forming assays

acquired using a Cytation 3 (BioTek) equipped with a
10x objective (0.3 numerical aperture), a 16-bit gray scale
charged couple device camera and Gen5 software. Nine
central, non-overlapping images were acquired per well
(i.e. condition), and the total number of cells remaining
in each well was determined. All data were imported into
Prism v6.0 (GraphPad), normalized to GAPDH silenced
controls, and basic statistical analyses (e.g. mean, standard
deviation, Student t-tests) were performed as described
[24]. To address reproducibility all experiments were
conducted a minimum of three times.

Modified colony forming assays (mCFAs) were
performed utilizing a cell seeding density of 1000 cells/
well. Briefly, cells were seeded and treated 24 h later in
sextuplet with DMSO, BMN673, or Olaparib. Cells were
permitted to grow for 7 days, following which they were
fixed, counterstained (0.005% crystal violet solution;
Sigma) and imaged. Image intensity thresholding was
applied to generate a binary mask that was employed
to quantify cell confluency. Next, a circle of a fixed
diameter was applied to each well and the average pixel
intensity was determined and presented relative to the
corresponding control. Similar mCFAs were performed
for combinatorial drug treatments, where the media were
supplemented with DMSO, BMN673, LCS-1, 5-FU, or
combinations of BMN673 plus 5-FU or BMN673 plus
LCS-1. Drug concentrations and cell seeding densities
were optimized to achieve appropriate growth within a
quantifiable range (9 nM BMN673, 52 nM 5-FU and 187.5
nM LCS-1 at 2000 cells/well). To address reproducibility
all experiments were conducted a minimum of three times.

Dose response curves
Standard dose response curves were generated
using a 10-fold serial dilution of BMN673 (200 fM
to 20 μM), Olaparib (2 pM to 200 μM), a 5-fold serial
dilution of 5-FU (1.28 nM to 100 μM), or a 2-fold serial
dilution of LCS-1 (46.9 nM to 12 μM). Briefly, 4000
RAD54B-proficient or -deficient cells were seeded into
96-well optical plates, permitted to attach and treated 24
h post-seeding with DMSO (vehicle control), BMN673,
Olaparib, 5-FU, or LCS-1. Cells were permitted to grow
for an additional 3.5 days, at which point they were
fixed, counterstained (Hoechst), imaged, and analyzed as
above. Imaging data (i.e. nuclear counts) were imported
into Prism v5.0 (GraphPad) and normalized to DMSO
control and an Effective Concentration 50 (EC50) value
was determined. The EC50 values for BMN673 (9 nM),
Olaparib (2.6 μM), 5-FU (52 nM) and LCS-1 (1.7 μM) in
RAD54B-deficient cells were employed in all subsequent
experiments. All experiments were conducted a minimum
of three times.

Quantitative imaging microscopy
The presence of DNA DSBs was evaluated using
an established quantitative, indirect immunofluorescence
(IIF) approach [51]. Briefly, 120,000 cells were seeded
onto coverslips and permitted to attach. Cells were
treated with media containing BMN673, Olaparib or
DMSO 24 h post cell seeding and grown for an additional
24 h. Ionizing radiation (IR; 2 Grey) was used as a
positive control for DNA DSBs using an RS 2000 X-ray
Irradiator (RAD Source Technologies). Cells were fixed,
permeabilized, immunofluorescently labeled with γ-H2AX
(Abcam ab26350; 1:200) antibody, counterstained (DAPI)
and imaged using identical exposure times as described
[51]. The total γ-H2AX signal intensity was determined
for each nucleus from a minimum of 175 nuclei/condition.
Apoptosis was similarly assessed and quantified by
calculating the percentage of cells labeled with a cleaved
Caspase-3 antibody (Abcam ab13847; 1:200). Briefly,
cells were seeded as above and treated with Staurosporine
(1 μM; positive control), DMSO, BMN673 or Olaparib.
Cells were fixed, permeabilized, immunofluorescently
labeled and a minimum of 500 nuclei/condition were
imaged and evaluated.

Real time cell analyses
Real-time cell analyses (RTCA) (i.e. proliferation
curves) were performed in quadruplicate using an RTCAdual plate (RTCA-DP; Acea Biosciences) instrument
housed within a 37°C incubator. The RTCA-DP system
employs microelectrodes at the bottom of each well to
measure increases or decreases in electrical impedance,
termed cell index that reflect increases or decreases in cell
numbers, respectively. Briefly, 4000 cells were seeded into
each well of an E-plate and growth was monitored every
15 min. DMSO, BMN673 or Olaparib were supplemented
into the appropriate wells 24 h post seeding, and growth
was monitored for ~4 days. All data were imported into
Prism, where Proliferation Defects (PD) were calculated
for each line and condition using the following formula:



PD = 1 −



Multi-agent dose response
To assess multi-drug combinations a similar protocol
to the Dose Response Curve (above) was employed.
Briefly, 4000 asynchronous cells were seeded into each
well of a 96-well optical plate. After 24 h, media were
supplemented with DMSO (vehicle control), BMN673,

5-FU, LCS-1, or a combination of BMN673 plus 5-FU, or
BMN673 plus LCS-1. Five distinct concentrations were
employed for BMN673 (2.25, 4.5, 9, 18, 36 nM), while
four concentrations were employed for 5-FU (26, 52,
104, 208 nM) and LCS-1 (0.75, 1.5, 3, 6 μM). Cells were
permitted to grow for 3.5 days at which point they were
analyzed as described above. All data were normalized to
DMSO treated controls, and imported into Combenefit
software where the Loewe Additivity model was
employed to identify synergistic, additive or antagonistic
drug combinations.
