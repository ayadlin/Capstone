Abstract
Androgens, through their actions on the androgen receptor
(AR), are required for the development of the prostate and
contribute to the pathologic growth dysregulation observed
in prostate cancers. Consequently, androgen ablation has
become an essential component of the pharmacotherapy
of prostate cancer. In this study, we explored the utility of
targeting processes downstream of AR as an alternate approach for therapy. Specifically, we show that the serum and
glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) gene is an androgenregulated target gene in cellular models of prostate cancer.
Furthermore, functional serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated
kinase 1 (SGK1) protein, as determined by the phosphorylation of its target Nedd4-2, was also increased with androgen
treatment. Importantly, we determined that RNA interference–mediated knockdown of SGK1 expression attenuates the
androgen-mediated growth of the prostate cancer cell line
LNCaP. Given these findings, we explored the utility of SGK1
as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer by developing and
evaluating a small-molecule inhibitor of this enzyme. From
these studies emerged GSK650394, a competitive inhibitor
that quantitatively blocks the effect of androgens on LNCaP
cell growth. Thus, in addition to androgen ablation, inhibition
of pathways downstream of AR is likely to have therapeutic
utility in prostate cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7475–83]

Introduction
One in six men will develop prostate cancer during their lifetime,
and with f30,000 deaths per year attributed to the disease, it is
the second leading cause of cancer death in men (1). The majority
of prostate cancers express the androgen receptor (AR) and rely
on androgens for growth and survival. For this reason, patients
with advanced prostate cancers generally undergo androgen
deprivation therapy with chemical and/or surgical castration as a
primary intervention. Although 80% of patients with local or
metastatic prostate cancer initially respond favorably to androgen
ablation therapy, most patients eventually experience a relapse of
the disease, which is then considered to be hormone refractory

(2, 3). Unfortunately, effective therapeutic options are limited for
these patients. Although hormone-refractory disease is no longer
responsive to androgen deprivation therapy, AR signaling pathways
remain active and necessary for cancer progression (4). Therefore,
novel therapeutics that facilitate AR turnover or target signaling
pathways downstream of receptor activation may be an effective
treatment option for hormone-refractory disease. Consequently,
there is renewed interest in the pharmacologic exploitation of AR
signaling pathways for prostate cancer therapeutics.
Although the phenotypic responses of the prostate and prostate
cancer cells to androgens are well described, the molecular events
underlying these activities are not well understood. However,
the results of microarray studies done by both our laboratory and
others have led to the identification of pathways and specific
genes that are likely to be important for AR biology in prostate
cancer. Among the genes identified in this manner is that encoding
serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1; refs. 5–7).
SGK1 belongs to the AGC family of serine/threonine protein
kinases, which also includes protein kinase C and Akt. As its name
implies, SGK1 expression is regulated by glucocorticoids and
serum, in addition to various other types of signals (8–15). The
enzymatic activity of SGK1 is regulated by specific phosphorylation
events initiated by phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K; refs. 16–20).
Specifically, upon PI3K activation, SGK1 is phosphorylated at Ser422
by an as yet unidentified kinase, referred to as the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK)-2, followed by the phosphorylation of Thr256 within the activation loop of the SGK1 catalytic
domain by PDK1 to become fully activated (19).
Many prostate cancers rely on the PI3K signaling pathway for
growth and survival. This is reflected by the high incidence of lossof-function mutations in the gene that encodes the PI3K negative
regulator phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) in prostate
cancers (21, 22). In fact, the prostate-specific PTEN knockout mice
develop invasive prostate cancer with 100% penetrance, indicating
that within the context of the murine prostate, constitutive PI3K
signaling is sufficient for the development of cancer (23).
A considerable number of studies have addressed the role of Akt
as the mediator of PI3K-dependent stimulation of growth and survival in prostate cancer. Interestingly, however, both Akt and SGK1
phosphorylate and regulate the activity of many of the same target
proteins. Recently, SGK1 has also been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and survival downstream of PI3K activation
(24–27). Therefore, considering that most prostate cancers rely on
the androgen signaling pathway for growth, and activation of this
pathway leads to the induction of SGK1 expression, we hypothesized that SGK1 is required for androgen-mediated prostate cancer growth. This study shows that inhibition of SGK1 expression or

activity antagonizes androgen-induced growth of the prostate
cancer cell line LNCaP, suggesting that SGK1 might be a viable
target for the treatment of prostate cancer.

sequences of quantitative PCR primers used in these studies. In those
studies using actinomycin D and cycloheximide, the compounds were used
at concentrations previously shown to inhibit transcription and translation
in LNCaP cells (29).
Cell growth assays. LNCaP cells were plated at a density of 5,000 per
well ( for studies with GSK650394) or 20,000 per well ( for siRNA studies) in
96-well plates in 100 AL of phenol red-free (PRF)–RPMI 1640, supplemented

as described above. Twenty microliters of medium were removed from each
well and replaced with 20 AL of the siRNA/Dharmafect-1 mix to obtain a
final concentration of 50 nmol/L of siRNA. The siRNA transfection was
repeated on day 6. At day 3, cells were treated with hormone with or
without GSK650394 by removing 50 AL of the medium and replacing this
with 50 AL of PRF-RPMI 1640 with 8% charcoal-stripped FBS, nonessential

amino acids, and NaPyr containing a 2 concentration of the appropriate
hormone/inhibitor treatment. At days 5 and 7, the treatment was repeated.
On the 10th day, the medium was removed and the relative cell number was
measured using the FluoReporter Blue assay (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Fluorescence polarization assay. SGK1 S422D cDNA (amino acids
60–431) was subcloned into pFastBAC-HTc (Invitrogen). Protein was
expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified by Ni2+-NTA agarose chromatography. SGK1 was stored in a buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 270 mmol/L sucrose, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.1%
h-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmol/L
benzamidine. SGK1 was diluted to 4 Amol/L and activated in 50 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.1% h-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmol/L
magnesium acetate, and 0.1 mmol/L ATP with 3.3 Ag/mL glutathione
S-transferase-PDK1 at 30jC for 30 min. SGK1 was then repurified by Ni2+-NTA
agarose chromatography. To determine the efficiency of the activation
reaction, activated SGK1 [diluted in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% (v/v)
h-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA, and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin
(BSA)] was assayed for kinase activity using 30 Amol/L of a CROSStide
substrate peptide (a synthetic peptide consisting of the amino acids
GRPRTSSFAEG; Millipore Corp.) in 50 AL of 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
0.1% (v/v) h-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA, 10 mmol/L magnesium
acetate, 100 Amol/L [g-32P]ATP (50–1,000 cpm/pmol) at 30jC for 10 min.
Reactions were stopped by spotting 40 AL of the assay mixture onto Whatman
P81 paper, which was washed in 75 mmol/L phosphoric acid, followed
by acetone before air-drying and counting. Microscint-20 liquid scintillation
fluid (Packard Instruments) was added and the signal was detected by
measuring for 30 s per well in a Packard TopCount NXT Scintillation Counter.
A Rhodamine Green–labeled fluorescence polarization ligand
(a proprietary ATP mimetic; 0.5 nmol/L final concentration) and SGK1
(1 nmol/L final concentration) were incubated in buffer containing
50 nmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L CHAPS, 10 nmol/L MgCl2, and
1 mmol/L DTT for 15 min at room temperature. GSK650394 was dissolved
in DMSO and diluted in buffer for concentration-response curve
determination. The fluorescence signal was measured using an Acquest
(Molecular Devices) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and
530 nm, respectively. SGK1 inhibition IC50 was calculated from these data
using GraphPad Prism 3 software (GraphPad Software).
Scintillation proximity assay. SGK1 S422D (60–431 amino acids;
0.275 Ag/mL final concentration) or SGK2 (0.875 Ag/mL final concentration)
was activated by PDK1 (1.1 Ag/mL final concentration) in a buffer
consisting of 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA,
10 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1% h-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/mL BSA, and ATP
( final concentration of 0.15 mmol/L) and incubated for 30 min at 30jC.
SGK2 was prepared exactly as described for SGK1, except it corresponded
to the full-length protein. A solution containing biotinylated CROSStide
peptide at a final concentration of 75 Amol/L and [g-32P]ATP corresponding
to 2  106 cpm was prepared in the reaction buffer. In a 96-well plate, 5 AL
of GSK650394 were added to 25 AL of the activated enzyme mixture. To this,
20 AL of the CROSStide mixture were added and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. Next, 50 AL of a 25 mg/mL slurry of streptavidin-coated
scintillation proximity assay beads (Amersham) in PBS with 0.1 mol/L
EDTA (pH 8.0) were added. The plate was then sealed and centrifuged for
8 min at 2,000 rpm, and the signal was detected by measuring for 30 s per
well in a Packard TopCount NXT Scintillation Counter. The IC50 values of
the inhibition of SGK1 and SGK2 activities by GSK650394 were calculated
from these data using GraphPad Prism 3 software.
Toxicity assays. The toxicity of GSK650394 to M-1 and HeLa cells was
assessed using the Cell Proliferation Kit [2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt (XTT)] following
the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche). Briefly, 10,000 HeLa or M-1 cells
per well were plated into 96-well plates in 100 AL of the appropriate
maintenance medium. After 48 h, medium was removed and replaced with
100 AL of EMEM with Earle’s salts containing 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 1%
antibiotic-antimycotic overnight. M-1 cells were also supplemented with
1 Ag/mL insulin, 6.25 Ag/mL sodium selenite, and 6.25 Ag/mL transferrin.
After 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 AL of medium

alone or medium containing increasing concentrations of GSK650394. For
HeLa cells, 50 AL of activated XTT solution were added after 4 h. For M-1
cells, 50 AL of activated XTT solution were added after 24 h. Following a
2-h incubation, absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a SpectraMAX
PLUS spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) and the data were analyzed
to obtain IC50 values using GraphPad Prism 3 software.
Short circuit current assay. Short circuit current (SCC) was determined
in M-1 cells as previously reported (30). Cells were grown to confluence,
trypsinized, and plated onto 12-mm transwell membranes (0.4-Am pore
diameter; Corning) at a density of 55,000 per well in EMEM supplemented
with 5% FBS, 15 mmol/L HEPES, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 1 Ag/mL insulin,
6.25 Ag/mL sodium selenite, 6.25 Ag/mL transferrin, and 1% antibiotic/
antimycotic. After the cells reached confluency on the transwell membranes, the medium was replaced with medium lacking FBS. Baseline
measurements were obtained to ensure monolayer confluency and viability
by showing adequate resistance. The voltage and resistance of the cell
monolayer were measured using a EVOMX Epithelial Voltohmmeter with
an STX2 electrode (WPI). Voltage was zeroed by measuring V te across a
transwell with no cells, then V te was determined from the basolateral
chamber. The initial resistance, R te, was determined by applying current
across the cell monolayer for a period of <1 s. The equilibrium current,
I eq, was calculated by dividing the voltage by the resistance for initial
measurement and normalized by surface area of the membrane.
Aldosterone (1 Amol/L) was added to the appropriate compartment and
I eq was obtained from six wells. After 4 h, GSK650394 plus aldosterone was
added and I eq was obtained. At the end of the experiment, amiloride, which
inhibits epithelial sodium transport through the inhibition of the epithelial
sodium channel, was added to a final concentration of 10 Amol/L and
the amiloride-sensitive SCC was measured and subtracted from the total
SCC to obtain SGK1-induced SCC. The IC50 values were calculated from
these data using GraphPad Prism 3 software.

Results
Androgen-activated AR induces the expression of SGK1.
Microarray analyses done in our laboratory revealed that the SGK1
gene is regulated by androgens in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell
line (5). To validate the microarray results and to determine if SGK1
is regulated by androgens in other AR-expressing prostate cancer
cell lines, the expression levels of SGK1 were measured in the
prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, VCaP, and LAPC4 in the presence
and absence of the synthetic androgen R1881 using quantitative
PCR. Similar to the induction observed in our microarray study,
SGK1 mRNA levels were up-regulated f20-fold in LNCaP cells
(Fig. 1A). This up-regulation in response to androgens was also
apparent in other AR-expressing prostate cancer cell lines, with
VCaP cells exhibiting a 10-fold increase and LAPC4 cells a 2.5-fold
increase in SGK1 mRNA levels. Although LAPC4 cells showed a less
dramatic androgen-mediated induction of SGK1 expression levels,
we did note that the basal level of SGK1 expression is relatively
high in these cells. Given the robust androgen-dependent induction
of SGK1 expression in LNCaP cells, all subsequent studies were
done in this cell line.
SGK1 mRNA levels are up-regulated by androgens in a dosedependent manner, with levels increasing at 100 pmol/L R1881 and
reaching maximal levels at 10 to 100 nmol/L, which is the
approximate concentration at which ligand saturates the receptor
(Fig. 1B). The enhancement of SGK1 mRNA levels in response to
androgens is evident as early as 3 hours posttreatment, suggesting
that the sgk1 gene is a direct transcriptional target of androgenbound AR (Fig. 1C). This was confirmed by showing that SGK1
mRNA was not induced in the presence of actinomycin D but was
unaffected by cycloheximide (Supplementary Fig. S1). Importantly,
the antiandrogen Casodex (1 Amol/L) inhibited R1881 (1 nmol/L)–

Figure 1. Androgens up-regulate SGK1 transcript levels. LNCaP, VCaP, and
LAPC4 cells were grown in medium with charcoal-stripped FBS for 3 d before
the addition of ethanol (veh) or R1881 [10 nmol/L (A and C ) or at the indicated
doses (B)]. After a 24-h incubation (A and B) or the indicated time points (C ),
cells were lysed and RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed. The expression
of SGK1 was assessed with quantitative PCR and normalized to GAPDH
expression levels. Each experiment was done at least thrice, with a

dependent increases in SGK1 transcript levels (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, three AR-targeted siRNAs, each of which effectively suppressed expression of both AR mRNA and protein, suppressed
the androgen-mediated up-regulation of SGK1 mRNA expression
(Fig. 2B–D). Taken together, these studies confirm that SGK1 is a
primary target of AR in prostate cancer cells.
Androgen treatment increases SGK1 protein levels and
activity. The up-regulation of SGK1 mRNA levels in the presence
of androgens was accompanied by a commensurate increase
in steady-state SGK1 protein levels (Fig. 3A). In the absence of
androgens, SGK1 protein levels were undetectable by immunoblotting. In response to R1881 (10 nmol/L), protein levels began
to increase within 3 hours of treatment and were sustained up to

Figure 2. The androgen-mediated up-regulation of SGK1 is AR dependent. A, LNCaP cells were grown in medium with charcoal-stripped FBS for 3 d before the
addition of ethanol or R1881 (1 nmol/L) in the presence or absence of Casodex (1 Amol/L). After a 24-h incubation, cells were lysed and RNA was isolated and reverse
transcribed. The expression of SGK1 was assessed with quantitative PCR and normalized to GAPDH expression levels. B to D, LNCaP cells were transiently
transfected with Stealth siRNAs targeting AR (AR-A, AR-B, or AR-C) or a negative control (neg ) Stealth siRNA at a final concentration of 50 nmol/L. Cells were ‘‘mock’’
transfected as an additional negative control. Forty-eight hours later, cells were treated with ethanol or R1881 (10 nmol/L) for 24 h. AR (B) and SGK1 (D ) mRNA levels
were detected with quantitative PCR. SGK1 and AR mRNA levels were normalized with GAPDH mRNA levels. Each experiment was done at least thrice, with a
representative experiment shown; bars, SD. C, whole-cell extracts were prepared and proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane, which was probed with antibodies against AR and GAPDH (loading control).

48 hours posttreatment (Fig. 3B). This is notable considering that
others have shown that SGK1 expression, in response to various
stimuli, is typically rapid and transient (12). LNCaP cells are PTEN
null and therefore exhibit constitutive activation of PI3K (31). Not
surprisingly therefore, the SGK1 protein is phosphorylated and
migrates as multiple bands on immunoblots.
One of the most well-characterized roles for SGK1 is in
hypertension where SGK1 phosphorylates and inhibits the
ubiquitin ligase neural precursor cell–expressed, developmentally
down-regulated protein 4-2 (Nedd4-2) at Ser468 (S468), which
ultimately affects epithelial sodium ion transport (32). Hence, to
verify that the SGK1 protein is active in LNCaP cells under our
particular growth conditions, we analyzed the phosphorylation
state of the SGK1 target protein Nedd4-2. Here, we show an
increase in Nedd4-2 S468 phosphorylation in response to
androgen treatment, confirming that androgens facilitate an
enhancement of SGK1 signaling processes (Fig. 3A). Interestingly,
the strong enhancement of SGK1 levels in response to androgens
did not produce an immediate dramatic elevation of Nedd4-2
phosphorylation. This may suggest that not only does SGK1 need
to be expressed and posttranslationally activated but other
limiting activities (i.e., translocation to its target) must also
occur. Additionally, the constitutive PI3K activity in LNCaP cells
due to the PTEN-null status may increase the basal phosphor-

ylation of Nedd4-2, dampening the effects of androgens on this
end point.
SGK1 expression is required for androgen-mediated proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Given the role of SGK1 as a
growth factor–responsive kinase and the fact that it is a
downstream target of PI3K, we hypothesized that its induction
by androgens may be necessary for androgen-dependent growth of
LNCaP cells. To test this hypothesis, three siRNAs, each of which
effectively reduced SGK1 mRNA and protein expression, were
analyzed for their effects on LNCaP cell growth (Fig. 4A and B).
As a positive control, we showed that each of the three different
AR siRNAs completely abrogated the androgenic stimulation of
growth in LNCaP cells, whereas negative control siRNA had no
effect under the same conditions (Fig. 4C). More importantly, when
any of the three SGK1 siRNAs was transfected into LNCaP cells,
we observed a 50% to 60% inhibition of the 2.5-fold stimulation of
growth in the presence of androgens, with no effect on the cells in
the absence of androgens (Fig. 4C). These studies, using RNA
interference–mediated knockdown of SGK1, support the hypothesis that this protein is required for androgen-dependent growth
of LNCaP cells.
Development of a novel SGK1 inhibitor, GSK650394. Given
that SGK1 expression is required for androgen-dependent growth
of prostate cancer cells, we hypothesized that SGK1 would be a

viable target for the development of pharmacologic agents for
the treatment of prostate cancer. To test this, we developed a
novel compound, GSK650394, which functionally inhibits SGK1,
and examined the effects of this compound on cellular models of
prostate cancer. The structure of GSK650394 is shown in Fig. 5A and
its initial characterization is described below and summarized in
Supplementary Table S2.
A fluorescence polarization assay was used to determine the
affinity of GSK650394 for activated SGK1. The ability of GSK650394
to displace a Rhodamine Green fluorescently labeled smallmolecule ATP mimetic bound to purified SGK1 protein corresponding to amino acids 60 to 431 (which harbors a S422D
mutation to mimic phosphorylation of the PDK2 site and was
fully activated by recombinant PDK1) was measured. In this assay,
GSK650394 inhibited activated SGK1 with an IC50 of 13 nmol/L
(data not shown).
The ability of GSK650394 to inhibit the enzymatic activity of
SGK1 and SGK2 was measured using an in vitro activity-based
scintillation proximity assay. This assay measures SGK1- or SGK2mediated phosphorylation of a serine residue within a synthetic
biotinylated peptide substrate. SGK1 or SGK2 phosphorylates
the peptide substrate, thereby incorporating a radiolabeled
phosphate, which is subsequently incubated with streptavidincoated polystyrene beads containing a scintillant. The localization
of the radiolabeled peptide within the immediate vicinity of the
scintillant-containing bead generates a measurable light signal.
GSK650394 inhibited the enzymatic activity of SGK1 and SGK2 in
the scintillation proximity assay with IC50 values of 62 and 103
nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 5B).
The inhibitory effects of GSK650394 on SGK1 activity were
further evaluated using cell-based assays. Importantly, GSK650394
is relatively nontoxic, with LC50 values of 41 Amol/L in M-1 cells

Figure 4. SGK1 expression is required for androgen-mediated proliferation
of LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were transfected with the Stealth SGK1 A, B,
or C siRNAs or a negative control siRNA at a final concentration of 50 nmol/L.
Cells were mock transfected as an additional negative control. Two days later,
cells were treated with ethanol or R1881 (10 nmol/L). A, after a 24-h incubation,
cells were lysed and RNA was isolated. RNA was reverse transcribed and
transcript levels of SGK1 were measured with quantitative PCR and were
normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels; bars, SD. B, whole-cell extracts were
collected and proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE gel, followed by transfer
onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with antibodies
against SGK1 or GAPDH (loading control). C, LNCaP cells were incubated in
medium with charcoal-stripped FBS for 2 d. Cells were transiently transfected
with Stealth SGK1 (SGK-A , SGK-B , or SGK-C ), AR (AR-A , AR-B , or AR-C ),
or negative control siRNAs at a final concentration of 50 nmol/L. An additional

or R1881 (10 nmol/L) on days 3, 5, and 7. On day 10, cells were lysed and
the relative number of cells was measured with the fluorescent DNA-binding

(68 times its activity IC50) and LC50 >100 Amol/L in HeLa cells in
XTT assays, which measure mitochondrial enzymatic activity (data
not shown). SGK1 has been linked to hypertension and mice
lacking the sgk1 gene have higher sodium excretion and lower
blood pressure than wild-type mice when fed a low-sodium diet
(33, 34). This has been attributed to the regulation of epithelial
sodium ion transport by SGK1 in response to aldosterone
stimulation. GSK650394 was evaluated for its effects on this
well-documented SGK1-mediated biological activity, which was
measured using an aldosterone-stimulated SCC cellular assay.

Figure 5. GSK650394 inhibits the activity of SGK1.
A, chemical structure of GSK650394. B, GSK650394
quantitatively inhibits the activity of SGK1 and SGK2
in a scintillation proximity assay. Activated SGK1
or SGK2 proteins were incubated with increasing
concentrations of GSK650394 and a synthetic
biotinylated peptide substrate (CROSStide). Activity
was assessed by detection of the radiolabeled
phosphate that was incorporated into the biotinylated
CROSStide, when bound to streptavidin-coated
polystyrene beads containing a scintillant. The
experiment was done twice, and results were
normalized to percent maximum enzyme activity, with
a representative experiment shown. C, GSK650394
fully inhibits amiloride-sensitive SCC in M-1 cells. M-1
cells were plated in EMEM with 5% FBS onto 12-mm
transwell membranes with 0.4-Am pore diameter and
1.13-cm2 active surface area and maintained for 5 to
7 d until confluent. On the day of the experiment,
medium was replaced with EMEM with no supplements
and basal voltage and resistance measurements
were obtained and the baseline was set. Aldosterone
(1 Amol/L) was added to the appropriate compartment
and I eq was obtained from six wells. After 4 h,
GSK650394 plus aldosterone was added and I eq
was obtained. At the end of the experiment, amiloride
was added to a final concentration of 10 Amol/L
and the amiloride-sensitive SCC was measured and
subtracted from the total SCC to obtain SGK1-induced
SCC. The experiment was done twice, and results
were normalized to percent maximum amiloridesensitive SCC, with a representative experiment
shown.

GSK650394 inhibited SGK1-mediated epithelial transport with an
IC50 of 0.6 Amol/L in the SCC assay (Fig. 5C).
The specificity of GSK650394 for SGK1 over that of the most
closely related AGC kinase family member, Akt, and other related
kinases was measured using standard in vitro kinase assays
(University of Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom). The selectivity
of GSK650394 for SGK1 over that of Akt and other related kinases
proved to be >30-fold, whereas GSK650394 was >60-fold selective
for SGK1 over the upstream AGC kinase PDK1 (Supplementary
Table S2).

repressed the androgen-mediated enhancement of Nedd4-2 phosphorylation, suggesting that GSK650394 antagonizes SGK1 activity
in these cells (Fig. 6A). Next, a 10-day growth assay, similar to the
one described for the siRNA studies (Fig. 4C), was used to measure
the effects of GSK650394 on LNCaP cell growth. Of note,
GSK650394 had no effect on LNCaP cell growth or survival in the
absence of androgens and is therefore not toxic at the levels used
in these experiments (Fig. 6B). Although GSK650394 had no effect
on cell survival or growth in the absence of androgens, the
compound dramatically inhibited the androgen-stimulated growth
of LNCaP cells. In the LNCaP growth assay, the IC50 of GSK650394
was f1 Amol/L (which is similar to the previously measured IC50

in other cell-based assays). Furthermore, 10 Amol/L GSK650394
completely abrogated androgen-mediated growth, indicating that
small-molecule inhibitors of SGK1 may be an effective approach for
the treatment of AR-driven prostate cancer.

Discussion
These studies show that androgens up-regulate SGK1 mRNA
levels in an AR-dependent fashion. This observation parallels
findings presented within a recent report by Shanmugam et al. (6).
However, in contrast to the studies by Shanmugam et al. in which
cells are grown under serum-free conditions, the experiments
presented herein were done in the presence of 8% charcoalstripped serum, which is more reflective of physiologic conditions.
Therefore, our studies suggest that even in the presence of serum,
which in and of itself is capable of inducing SGK1 expression,
androgens are able to enhance SGK1 mRNA levels. Our studies
further show that the androgen-dependent induction of SGK1
mRNA levels correlates with an increase in functionally active
SGK1 protein. This observation, in combination with the demonstration that siRNA-mediated down-regulation of SGK1 expression inhibits androgen-dependent growth of prostate cancer cells,
suggests that the enzymatic activity of SGK1 might be responsible

for androgen-stimulated prostate cancer growth and may represent
a viable target for the treatment of prostate cancer.
A possible mechanism by which SGK1 might control cell cycle
progression and proliferation in prostate cancer cells is through
the direct or indirect regulation of the activity of the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein. Notably, it has been shown by
others that androgens stimulate mTOR activity in LNCaP cells (7).
Active mTOR contributes to an enhancement of the translation
rates of various proteins involved in cell cycle progression,
including cyclins D1 and D2 (7). In addition, Xu and colleagues
indicated that SGK1 may activate mTOR through the activation of
various cellular transporters and the subsequent influx of certain
nutrients and amino acids (7, 35). Interestingly, the expression of
many of the same cellular transporters is enhanced by androgens
(7). Additionally, SGK1 may regulate mTOR activity in a more direct
manner through the phosphorylation and inactivation of TSC2, a
negative regulator of mTOR, because the expression of constitutively active SGK1 in cardiomyocytes is associated with an
enhancement of TSC2 phosphorylation and mTOR activity (24).
It has been suggested that SGK1 may regulate AR transcriptional
activity, affecting androgen-mediated prostate cancer growth
through a positive feedback mechanism (6). We have not been
able to confirm this result and were unable to observe any effects
of GSK650394 on the expression level of a panel of androgenregulated genes in LNCaP cells under conditions where proliferation was completely repressed (data not shown). At this time,
however, we cannot exclude the possibility that SGK1 activity is
required for the regulation of a subset of androgen-regulated genes.
We have shown that SGK1 expression (siRNA-mediated downregulation) and activity (GSK650394 studies) are required for the
effects of androgens on prostate cancer growth. The growth inhibition observed following treatment with GSK650394 was more
dramatic than that observed with the SGK1 siRNAs. This might be
due to the residual expression of SGK1 observed in our knockdown
experiments. Given its function as an enzyme, even a relatively low
level of expression of the protein could have dramatic effects on
downstream targets. Alternatively, the effectiveness of GSK650394
as a growth inhibitor might also be due to the nonspecific
inhibition of other kinases, particularly other members of the SGK
protein family, SGK2 and SGK3. Interestingly, although previous
reports have suggested that SGK3 expression is constitutive and
is only regulated at the protein level, we have shown that SGK3
expression levels are also induced in response to androgen treatment in all the AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines that were
tested (ref. 36; data not shown). Notably, the up-regulation of
SGK3 mRNA levels (f3-fold induction) is much less dramatic than
the stimulation of SGK1 expression (f20-fold induction). SGK2
expression was not affected by androgens in any of the cell lines
tested. Whereas SGK1 and SGK3 have been shown to phosphorylate many of the same target proteins in vitro, differences in
subcellular localization suggest that these proteins regulate distinct
signaling pathways (36). SGK3 is localized to endosomes where it
has been suggested to play a role in endocytosis (37), unlike the
defined role in growth and survival ascribed to SGK1. Therefore, although GSK650394 is able to inhibit SGK2 and possibly also
inhibits SGK3, the expression patterns and subcellular localizations of these proteins suggest that inhibition of these kinases by
the SGK1 antagonist will probably be of little consequence to the
growth of prostate cancer cells.
GSK650394 is relatively selective for SGK1 over Akt, the most
closely related AGC kinase family member, as well as a host of

other related kinases, indicating that it should be a useful tool to
dissect the relative roles of Akt and SGK1 in PI3K-regulated
mechanisms. SGK1 and Akt share many of the same phosphorylation
targets and Akt has been implicated in the control of cell growth and
survival downstream of PI3K activation. It is unclear whether Akt
activity is required for prostate cancer growth and/or survival.
Transgenic mice expressing a prostate-restricted, constitutively
active Akt develop prostate intraepithelial neoplasia but never
develop prostate cancer (38). Although activation of Akt by androgens via a nongenomic mechanism has been described, this phenomenon has never been reported to occur in LNCaP cells, which
exhibit constitutive PI3K and Akt activation due to their PTEN-null
status (31, 39, 40). Xu and colleagues (7) were unable to observe
changes in the activation state of Akt following androgen treatment
of LNCaP cells. Furthermore, in preliminary studies done in our
laboratory, we have not observed any changes in the phosphorylation state of Ser473 of Akt in response to androgen treatment (data
not shown). This suggests that, at least in these cells and possibly in
all prostate cancer cells exhibiting constitutive PI3K activity,
androgen-stimulated proliferation may not depend on Akt activity
but rather on SGK1. Therefore, the SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394 might
be especially useful for the treatment of those prostate cancer
tumors that have developed mutations in PTEN or PI3K, leading to
constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways.
The identification and characterization of the novel SGK1 antagonist GSK650394 indicate that it can serve as a model compound
to aid in the identification of other small-molecule inhibitors with
similar activity and ideal pharmacokinetic characteristics to be
used in clinical trials. To date, GSK650394 has been formulated for

as pharmacodynamic markers suggest that GSK650394 is efficacious in rat models of hypertension. However, at present, we have
not tested GSK650394 in any animal models of prostate cancer.
At a minimum, GSK650394 is a useful pharmacologic tool to further identify pathways regulated by SGK1 that may permit the
development of more effective prostate cancer treatments. The
clinical success of lapatinib for advanced/metastatic breast cancer
and imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors suggests, by analogy, that kinase activities can be
selectively targeted and modulated for the treatment of prostate
cancer or hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
