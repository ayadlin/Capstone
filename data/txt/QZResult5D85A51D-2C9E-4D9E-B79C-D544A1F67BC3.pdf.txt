BACKGROUND: Plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA is widely used in screening, monitoring, and prediction of relapse
in nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, data regarding utility of plasma EBV DNA in metastatic
NPC are rare. The current study was to test the prognostic implication of plasma EBV DNA level in metastatic/recurrent
NPC patients treated with palliative chemotherapy. METHODS: Plasma EBV DNA level was measured at baseline and
thereafter at the start of each treatment cycle in 127 histologically proven metastatic/recurrent NPC patients treated
with palliative chemotherapy. Correlations of pre-treatment and post-treatment plasma EBV DNA levels to survival
and response were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with a low pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA level (<median) had significantly better survival than those with a high pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA level (median). Patients with a
post-treatment plasma EBV DNA decline to an undetectable level had better survival and better tumor response
compared with those with a sustained detectable post-treatment plasma EBV DNA level. The early decrease of posttreatment plasma EBV DNA to an undetectable level after 1 cycle of chemotherapy was associated with significantly
increased survival. Patients with low pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA level and undetectable post-treatment plasma
EBV DNA showed a favorable prognosis (5-year overall and progression-free survival of 50.6% and 21.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma EBV DNA is of predictive value for prognosis in metastatic/recurrent NPC patients
undergoing palliative chemotherapy. The pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA level as well as the early decrease of
plasma EBV DNA after chemotherapy enabled easy and early discrimination between patients who will and those

KEYWORDS: nasopharyngeal carcinoma, plasma EBV DNA, palliative chemotherapy.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an endemic carcinoma in Southern China and Southeast Asia, where
about 50 to 80 cases per 100,000 of population per year are reported.1 Although NPC is sensitive to radiotherapy and
chemotherapy, about 20% to 30% of patients will ultimately develop distant metastasis and/or recurrence after definitive
treatment using conventional radiation therapy.2,3 Once metastasis is detected, treatment is mostly palliative chemotherapy, with a median overall survival duration of 12 to 15 months.4,5 However, patients with metastatic NPC do not behave
uniformly. For selected patients, survival rates exceeding 4 years have been reported.6,7 It is therefore critical to define reliable prognostic factors to identify patients with good or poor prognosis. Currently, evaluation of prognosis for metastatic
NPC patients treated with palliative chemotherapy mainly relies on clinical characteristics, including performance status
and disease-free interval.8 There is still no reliable laboratory prognostic factor. Recently, several studies including our
own data have shown that quantification of plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a useful marker in the detection, monitoring, and prognostic prediction for nondisseminated
NPC treated by radiotherapy.9-13 However, data regarding utility of plasma EBV DNA in metastatic NPC are rare. To
our knowledge, only 1 study has demonstrated the predictive and prognostic value of the clearance rates of plasma EBV

DNA during the first month in metastatic/recurrent
NPC.14 However, only 34 patients were included in that
study, and a rather high complete response rate (41.2%)
and long median survival (28 months) were achieved,
although most patients were just treated with old chemotherapy agents such as mitomycin-C, epirubicin, cisplatin,
or 5-fluorouracil, which might suggest a patient selection
bias. Moreover, multiple plasma samples were needed
during the first month of chemotherapy, which further
limits the utility of plasma EBV DNA clearance rate in
clinical practice. In our clinical experience, we have
observed that a proportion of patients with metastatic
NPC experience a dramatic decline of plasma EBV DNA
to undetectable levels after palliative chemotherapy. Such
a phenomenon has not previously been well described in
metastatic NPC patients. Therefore, we initiated the current study to investigate the prognostic implication of
pre-treatment and post-treatment plasma EBV DNA load
in metastatic/recurrent NPC patients who were treated
with palliative chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The study included 127 patients with histologically proven metastatic NPC treated with first-line chemotherapy
between May 2002 and April 2010 at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center. Entry criteria consisted of: 1) an
increased baseline plasma EBV DNA level; 2) radiologically measurable disease; 3) Karnofsky performance score
(KPS) 60; 4) normal renal and liver function; and 5)
informed written consent was obtained from all patients.
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center.
Treatment
All eligible patients received 1 of the following chemotherapy regimens as the first-line treatment: cisplatin (25
mg/m2 intravenously [IV] on Days 1-3 of a 21-day cycle)
plus 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 IV on Days 1-5 of a 21day cycle), cisplatin (25 mg/m2 IV on Days 1-3 of a 21day cycle) plus capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice a day by
mouth on Days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle), or paclitaxel (150
mg/m2 IV over 3 hours with standard premedication on
Day 1 of a 21-day cycle) plus cisplatin (25 mg/m2 IV
on Days 1-3 of a 21-day cycle) plus 5-fluorouracil
(800 mg/m2, continuous IV infusion for 24 hours, on
Days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle).

Evaluation of Tumor Response
Patients were evaluated for response every 2 treatment
cycles during treatment and then every 2 months until disease progression. The response evaluation of the tumor to
therapy was based on computed tomography (CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Patients were
classified as having a complete response (CR), partial
response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors.15 Bone metastases were assessed radiologically
(bone scan and x-ray or MRI) as either present or absent.
Real-Time Quantitative EBV DNA PCR
Measurement of plasma EBV DNA level was taken at
baseline and thereafter at the start of each treatment cycle.
Plasma DNA was extracted and subjected to a real-time
quantitative PCR assay as described previously.13 The
real-time quantitative PCR system was developed for
plasma EBV DNA detection toward the BamHI-W
region. The system consisted of the amplification primers
W-44F (50 -AGT CTC TGC CTC AGG GCA-30 ) and
W-119R (50 -ACA GAG GGC CTG TCC ACCG-30 )
and the dual-labeled fluorescent probe W-67T (50 -[FAM]
CAC TGT CTG TAA AGT CCA GCC TCC
[TAMRA]-30 ).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical
package SPSS for Windows version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). Progression-free survival (PFS) time was calculated from the day of first chemotherapy cycle to the date
of radiologic progression or death. Overall survival (OS)
was calculated from the first day of chemotherapy to the
date of death or the last follow-up visit. Both PFS and OS
were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between the groups of patients by the log-rank test.
Multivariate Cox regression model was used to determine
whether plasma EBV DNA was a significant predictor of
both OS and PFS. The relationship between plasma EBV
DNA level and response rate was evaluated by the chisquare test. All analyses were 2-sided. The level of significance was set at P < .05.

and neck area, among whom 51 (55.4%) patients received
radiotherapy alone, and 41 (44.6%) patients received
combined chemoradiotherapy. The adjuvant chemotherapy regimens were cisplatin or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil. At the time of recurrence, 3 (2.4%) patients had
isolated locoregional recurrences, 117 (92.1%) patients
had distant metastases only, and 7 (5.5%) had both.
Among all patients with distant metastases only, 75

(18.1%) had bone metastases. Patient characteristics are
listed in Table 1.
The median follow-up time was 21 months (range,
3-88 months). The Median PFS and OS were 7.2 and
17.0 months, respectively. The overall clinical response
rate was 66.9% for all 127 patients (CR in 7 patients and

Median baseline plasma EBV DNA level for all patients was

(CR and PR) were not significantly different between patients
with a baseline plasma EBV DNA level below the median

with a baseline plasma EBV DNA level equal to or above the
median (CR ¼ 2 and PR ¼ 36 in 63 assessable patients,

P < .001; median OS was 18.9 vs 14.5 months, respectively, P < .001) (Fig. 2C, D).
Of note, among 82 patients whose post-treatment
plasma EBV DNA dropped to undetectable levels, 47
(57.3%) patients demonstrated an early decline of plasma
EBV DNA to an undetectable level after 1 cycle of chemotherapy (21 days), 22 (26.8%) more patients had a plasma
EBV DNA decline to an undetectable level after 2 cycles
of chemotherapy (42 days), and another 13 (15.9%)
patients had plasma EBV DNA decline to an undetectable
level after >2 cycles of chemotherapy. The median PFS
and OS in patients who achieved an early drop of plasma
EBV DNA to an undetectable level after 1 cycle of chemotherapy were 9.6 and 19.6 months, compared with 7.6
(P ¼ .002) and 14.5 (P ¼ .081) months in those who
showed a late drop of plasma EBV DNA to an undetectable level after >1 cycle, and 3.9 (P < .001) and 14.5
months (P ¼ .004) in those with persistently detectable
post-treatment plasma EBV DNA (Fig. 2E, F).
Combination of the Pre-treatment and
Post-Treatment Plasma EBV DNA Status
Patients were divided into 4 subgroups according to
the baseline plasma EBV DNA level and the change
of plasma EBV DNA after chemotherapy: 1) low
pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA (<median) and
undetectable post-treatment plasma EBV DNA (35
patients); 2) low pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA
(<median) and detectable post-treatment plasma EBV
DNA (28 patients); 3) high pre-treatment plasma
EBV DNA (median) and undetectable post-treatment plasma EBV DNA (47 patients); and 4) high
pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA (median) and detectable post-treatment plasma EBV DNA (17
patients). Median PFS for these 4 subgroups was
11.9, 5.5, 7.1, and 3.6 months, respectively. Median
OS was 22.2, 14.5, 16.2, and 15.1 months, respectively. The 5-year PFS and OS rates in the low pretreatment/undetectable post-treatment subgroup were
21.7% and 50.6%, respectively, whereas no patients
in the other 3 subgroups of patients survived 5 years
(Fig. 3).
Multivariate Analysis
Various potential prognostic factors including pre-treatment and post-treatment plasma EBV DNA levels were
univariately analyzed by the log-rank test (Table 2). Liver
metastasis, pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA level, and
post-treatment plasma EBV DNA status were predictors

for OS. Multivariate analysis showed pre-treatment
plasma EBV DNA level and post-treatment plasma EBV
DNA status were the only 2 independent predictors for
both PFS and OS. No statistically significant impact on
survival time could be detected for the following factors
evaluated: age, sex, baseline performance status, and
chemotherapy regimens (Table 2 and 3).

DISCUSSION
The prognostic value of pre-treatment and post-treatment
plasma EBV DNA levels has been validated in nonmetastatic NPC patients treated with radiotherapy16 and
locally advanced NPC patients treated with concurrent
chemoradiotherapy.17,18 In our present study of a relatively large group of metastatic/recurrent NPC patients,
we first demonstrated that both pre-treatment and posttreatment plasma EBV DNA were strong predictors of
PFS and OS in metastatic/recurrent NPC treated with
palliative chemotherapy.
Our results demonstrated that patients with a pretreatment plasma EBV DNA level less than the median
value had significantly better PFS and OS compared with
those with a pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA level equal

to or above the median value. These results were inconsistent with the most recently published study by Wang et
al,14 which showed that the clearance rates of plasma EBV
DNA during the first month of chemotherapy rather than
baseline plasma EBV DNA level could predict tumor
response and patient survival. However, as we mentioned
above, a rather high CR rate (41.25%) and long median
survival (28 months) were reported in his cohort, which
suggested a patient selection bias and relatively small sample size, because most of previous studies in the same setting reported a CR rate of 3% to 6% and a median
survival of 12 to 18 months.19–21 The current study
showed that the CR rate was 5.5% (7 of 127), and median
OS was 17.0 months, which were in accordance with
most previous reports.19–21

3755

Original Article

Moreover, our study results showed that median PFS
and OS were significantly longer in patients with undetectable post-treatment plasma EBV DNA levels compared
with patients with a sustained detectable post-treatment
plasma EBV DNA level. Of note, 47 (57.3%) of 82 patients
showed an early decline of plasma EBV DNA within the
first cycle of chemotherapy. The significance of an early
decrease of plasma EBV DNA level was further evaluated,
and was shown to correspond with a significant increase in
median PFS and OS compared with patients who showed a
late drop of plasma EBV DNA to an undetectable level later
than the first cycle, or patients with persistently detectable
post-treatment plasma EBV DNA. These findings suggested
that undetectable post-treatment plasma EBV DNA levels
after the first cycle of chemotherapy could serve as an early
marker of response, allowing early discrimination between
patients who will and those who will not benefit from continued treatment. Compared with calculation of clearance
rates of plasma EBV DNA, which need multiple plasma
samples during the first month of chemotherapy, this test is
easier to perform in our clinical practices.
Meanwhile, our results demonstrated that the
response rate was significantly higher in patients whose
post-treatment plasma EBV DNA drops to undetectable
levels compared with patients whose plasma EBV DNA
did not. In particular, all 7 CR patients had a post-treatment plasma EBV DNA decline to an undetectable level,
whereas none of the 9 patients who progressed on imaging
showed a decrease in plasma EBV DNA to an undetectable
level. These findings suggest that the decrease in plasma
EBV DNA level could reflect the biosensitivity of the tumor cells to cytotoxic treatment during therapy. Although
undetectable post-treatment plasma EBV DNA level was
associated with better response, it could not further accurately discriminate PR from SD patients, as 73.1% of PR
and 54.5% of SD patients showed a drastic fall of plasma
EBV DNA to an undetectable level. Similar findings have
been described by Ngan et al, who evaluated plasma EBV
DNA before, during, and after salvage chemotherapy on
19 patients with metastatic/recurrent NPC and found that
4 of 9 PR and 2 of 4 SD patients showed a drastic drop of
plasma EBV DNA level to background level.22 Ma et al
also reported that 1 patient with local recurrence NPC who
was treated by gefitinib experienced minor tumor shrinkage, but post-treatment plasma EBV DNA declined to 0.23
Why plasma EBV DNA does not reflect tumor burden after chemotherapy consistently has not been clear until now.
Several studies have shown that circulating cell-free plasma
EBV DNA originates from the primary tumor,10 and cor-

3756

relates very well with the tumor mass and tumor metabolic
activity by positron emission tomography/CT scan before
treatment.24,25 Once released, plasma EBV DNA exists as
short fragments in the circulation instead of within intact
virions, which could be eliminated very quickly.9,10 In
addition to the direct cytotoxic effect, systemic chemotherapy might reduce plasma EBV DNA by interfering with
other relevant steps. For example, chemotherapy could
probably inhibit the metabolic activity of tumor cells, therefore inhibiting the secreting of plasma EBV DNA from primary tumor. Chemotherapy might also have an effect on
the factors that control the release rate of plasma EBV
DNA into the circulation, such as the degree of tumor
invasion into the adjacent vascular plexus. Further studies
are needed to elucidate the mechanism.
Furthermore, by combining the baseline plasma
EBV DNA level and post-treatment plasma EBV DNA
status, we identified a subgroup of patients with fairly
favorable prognosis, with a 5-year survival of 50.4%. This
might be of clinical importance. Several previous studies
suggested that a small proportion of patients with metastatic NPC were potentially curable by aggressive chemotherapy.6,7,26 However, no specific indicator for this
subgroup of patients was identified. In the current study,
we found that 21.7% of patients with low pre-treatment
plasma EBV DNA level (<median) and undetectable
post-treatment plasma EBV DNA level were free of disease at 5-year follow-up, suggesting that plasma EBV
DNA might be considered as an indicator for aggressive
chemotherapy to achieve long-term survival.
In conclusion, the current study indicated that
plasma EBV DNA is of predictive value for prognosis and
determining the response in patients with metastatic NPC
undergoing palliative chemotherapy. The pre-treatment
plasma EBV DNA level and early decrease of plasma EBV
DNA to an undetectable level after chemotherapy enable
early determination of patients who will benefit from continued treatment.
