Abstract
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increasing along
with breast cancer incidence worldwide. Because fenretinide
improves insulin action and glucose tolerance in insulinresistant obese mice and because tamoxifen has shown to
regulate several markers involved in metabolic syndrome, we
sought to investigate the effect of fenretinide or tamoxifen at
low dose on features linked to insulin resistance in premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer. We randomized
235 women to low-dose tamoxifen (5 mg/daily), fenretinide
(200 mg/daily), or their combination or placebo for 2 years.
We used the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA; fasting
insulin  glucose/22.5) to estimate insulin sensitivity. Women
were considered to improve insulin sensitivity when they
shifted from a HOMA z2.8 to <2.8. There was no effect of
fenretinide or tamoxifen on HOMA overall, but overweight
women (body mass index, z25 kg/m2) had a 7-fold greater
probability to normalize HOMA after 2 years of fenretinide
treatment [odds ratio (OR), 7.0; 95% confidence interval
(95% CI), 1.2–40.5], with 25% of women improving their
insulin sensitivity, whereas tamoxifen decreased insulin sensitivity by almost 7 times compared with subjects not taking
tamoxifen (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03–0.88). In this group only, 5%
improved their insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, women with
intraepithelial or microinvasive neoplasia had higher HOMA
(3.0) than unaffected subjects (2.8; P = 0.07). Fenretinide can
positively balance the metabolic profile in overweight premenopausal women and this may favorably affect breast
cancer risk. Furthermore, features of the metabolic syndrome
should be taken into consideration before proposing tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention. The clinical implications
of these results require further investigations. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Tamoxifen is Food and Drug Administration approved for breast
cancer risk reduction, but its use is associated with serious adverse
effects (1). We have conducted several trials using lower doses of
tamoxifen in an attempt to increase its therapeutic index (2, 3).
Fenretinide is a synthetic vitamin A derivative that selectively

accumulates in the breast tissue (4), exhibits apoptotic and antiinvasive properties in vitro and in vivo with a good toxicity profile
(5, 6) that has shown a lower risk of second breast cancer in premenopausal women, which persists several years after treatment
cessation (7).
Because the combination of tamoxifen and fenretinide is synergistic in rodent mammary tumor models and its safety has already
been shown in clinical trials (8), we conducted a 2  2 chemoprevention trial in premenopausal women using the change in plasma
insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and mammographic density as
surrogate–end point biomarkers. Preliminary results (3) showed that
the combination of low-dose tamoxifen and fenretinide is safe, that
tamoxifen reduces IGF-I levels by 15%, and that no synergistic effect
between the two drugs was observed on the primary study end points.
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome and obesity is rapidly
increasing in the Western world and evidence points to a link with
breast cancer incidence (9, 10). Strategies are being developed to
trim down breast cancer incidence and recurrence through insulinlowering drugs and dietary intervention combined with aerobic
exercise programs to reduce insulin resistance. Interestingly, Yang
and colleagues (11) showed an improvement in insulin action and
glucose tolerance by fenretinide in insulin-resistant obese mice, a
finding which prompted us to investigate the ability of fenretinide
to improve insulin sensitivity in humans. We were also interested in
assessing the effect of tamoxifen at a lower dose on the
homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index because previous
studies were somewhat contradictory, tamoxifen being associated
with a favorable profile of some lipids (2, 12, 13), but an increased
risk of hypertriglyceridemia (14).
Within our trial, we used the HOMA as a surrogate index of
insulin resistance (15). Women were randomized to receive either
low-dose tamoxifen (5 mg/daily), or fenretinide (200 mg/daily), or
their combination or placebo for 2 years. We considered women to
improve insulin sensitivity when they switched from a HOMA
status of z2.8 to a HOMA status of <2.8. This cutoff value corresponds to the lower limit of the highest quintile in a populationbased study conducted in 888 subjects randomly selected from the
general population in Bruneck, Italy (16).

Patients and Methods
Eligibility criteria. Eligible subjects were premenopausal women with
either an in situ breast cancer (n = 160) or a small invasive breast cancer of
favorable prognosis (pT1mic or pT1a; n = 21) in the previous 3 y. Unaffected
women (n = 54) were eligible if they had a Gail 5-y risk for breast cancer of
z1.7%. The main subject characteristics and the preliminary data have been
published elsewhere (3). All subjects signed a consent form approved by the
local Institutional Review Board.

Fenretinide, Low-Dose Tamoxifen, Insulin Sensitivity
Study design. A 2  2 factorial design was adopted for this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were randomized to
2-y treatment of either low-dose tamoxifen (5 mg/daily), or fenretinide
(200 mg/daily), or their combination, or placebo for 2 y. A monthly 3-d
interruption of fenretinide was introduced to allow the partial recovery of
retinal storage. Six-month follow-up continued after treatment completion
for at least 5 y. There were two randomization strata: high-risk women
identified from the Gail Model and affected women with in situ or pT1mic/
pT1a breast cancer. The study was conducted in two centers: the European
Institute of Oncology, Milan, where 91% of subjects were recruited, and the
Division of Medical Oncology, Vicenza, Italy.
Assay methods. Fasting blood samples for circulating biomarkers were
collected and stored at 80jC until centrally assayed. Serum glucose
concentration and lipid profile were determined on fresh samples by
enzymatic method with a Cobas Integra 800 (Roche Diagnostics S.p.A.).
Circulating serum insulin levels were measured by RIA kits purchased from
Diagnostic System Laboratories, Inc. (Webster). The sensitivity of the test
was 1.3 AIU/mL, whereas intra-assay and interassay CV of our in-house
pooled serum control sample (mean, 14.9 AIU/mL) were 11.5% and 15.2%,
respectively. Plasma IGF-I was determined on EDTA by chemiluminescent
immunometric assay method (Nichols Institute Diagnostics). The assay was
performed on the automatic instrument LIAISON (Diasorin SpA). The
sensitivity of the test was 0.8 nmol/L, whereas the intra-assay and interassay
CV of our in-house pooled serum control sample were 5.4% and 8.2%,
respectively. Total, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured by enzymatic luminescent methods
with COBAS INTEGRA 800 (Roche Diagnostics). Plasma leptin concentrations were measured using a RIA kit for human leptin (Linco Research,
Inc.). In this assay, the detection limit is 0.5 ng/mL; the intraassay CV is 2.2%
(5.9 ng/mL), 2.7% (25 ng/mL), and 5.9% (62.6 ng/mL); the interassay
precision from 10 different runs of 3 patients serum samples was 4.3%, 4%,
and 6.9% at the concentration of 5.1, 20.9, and 56.1 ng/mL, respectively.
Plasma retinol levels were measured by high performance liquid
chromatography using the method previously described (17).
We used the HOMA as a surrogate index of insulin sensitivity, i.e., [fasting
insulinemia (mU/L)  glycemia (mmol/L)]/22.5 (15).
Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were first used to characterize
the study population. The analysis was carried out for the whole population
and separately for overweight/obese women [body mass index (BMI), z25]

and normal weight subjects (BMI, <25). Spearman correlation coefficients (r)
were calculated to study the relationships between circulating biomarkers and
BMI. GLM models were also applied for the evaluation at baseline of the
association between leptin and HOMA index, adjusting for BMI and
randomization strata. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated to assess the
probability of having an in situ or a pT1mic/pT1a breast cancer compared
with unaffected high-risk women by unit of increase in HOMA index.
We evaluated the frequencies of subjects with HOMA of z2.8 at baseline
and HOMA of <2.8 at the first, second, and third year. Women were
considered to improve insulin sensitivity when they passed from a HOMA of
z2.8 to a HOMA of <2.8, using the cutoff value previously described (16).
Frequency differences by treatment groups were assessed using m2 tests for
independence of categorical variables, and risk analyses were done using
logistic regression. ORs assessed the probability of improving insulin
sensitivity status by fenretinide and tamoxifen treatment through logistic
regression adjusting for treatment allocation.
Values of IGF-I, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and
triglycerides were analyzed through a repeated-measure ANCOVA model
at I and II year of treatment. Because there was no statistically significant
interaction between drugs, we compared the women who had taken
fenretinide with those who did not, irrespective of the combination
treatment (placebo or tamoxifen), and women on tamoxifen with those
who were not, irrespective of the combination treatment (placebo or
fenretinide). This allowed us to gain statistical power. Mixed effects models
were adjusted for baseline value and included as fixed effects: time,
treatment (tamoxifen and fenretinide as indicators variables), HOMA index,
and interactions of treatment with HOMA index. Use of mixed-effect
models and the Kenward-Roger technique for determining denominator
degrees of freedom were adopted (PROC MIXED, SAS; ref. 18). Log
transformations were used when necessary to achieve normality. Predicted values of the biomarkers were plotted against HOMA index when we
found a significant interaction of treatment by HOMA index.
Data were analyzed using the SAS System Software for Windows, release
8.0. (SAS Institute; ref. 18).

treatment (P = 0.01) and retinol by fenretinide (P = 0.001). As
retinol levels correlated with HOMA index, we checked for a
possible interaction of HOMA index with retinol decline after
fenretinide treatment, but this was not significant.
Figure 1 illustrates the changes over time in insulin sensitivity
status by drug stratified by BMI. The findings, expressed as the
percentage of women who shifted from a HOMA of z2.8 to a
HOMA of <2.8, show that overweight women (BMI, z25) taking
fenretinide for 2 years had a 7-fold greater probability to improve
insulin sensitivity than women not taking fenretinide [OR, 7.0;
95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.2–40.5; P = 0.029; Fig. 1A]. In
contrast, tamoxifen decreased insulin sensitivity by nearly 7 times
in overweight women (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03–0.88; P = 0.04; Fig. 1B).
Neither agent showed any effect on insulin sensitivity in subjects
with normal BMI. We also looked at the effect in each of the
4 allocated arms, and the insulin-sensitizing effect of fenretinide
was particularly evident in the ‘‘fenretinide+placebo’’ arm, where
the median HOMA levels decreased from 5.2 to 2.5 after 2 years
of treatment in this group.
Figure 2 shows the differential effects of tamoxifen according
to BMI category as regards the relationship between HOMA index
and IGF-I (A and B) or HDL cholesterol (C and D). In women with
normal BMI, IGF-I levels increased with increasing HOMA index

and were significantly lowered by tamoxifen regardless of HOMA
index values (P = 0.01; Fig. 2A). At variance, in overweight women,
the decrease exerted by tamoxifen was much greater with increasing HOMA index (P = 0.004 for the HOMA  tamoxifen interaction;
Fig. 2B). In normal-weight women, tamoxifen improved HDL-C as
HOMA increased (P = 0.02 for the HOMA tamoxifen  interaction; Fig. 2C), whereas in overweight women, tamoxifen decreased
HDL-C as HOMA increased (P = 0.001 for the HOMA  tamoxifen
interaction; Fig. 2D).
Figure 3 shows the different effects of the drugs according to
BMI category on the relationship between HOMA index and
triglycerides (A and B) or leptin (C and D). Tamoxifen increased
triglyceride levels as HOMA increased irrespective of BMI (P = 0.01
for the HOMA  tamoxifen interaction; Fig. 3A). In contrast, in
normal-weight women, fenretinide blunted the increase in
triglycerides associated with the HOMA increase (P = 0.01 for the
HOMA  fenretinide interaction; Fig. 3B). Finally, fenretinide had a
different effect on leptin levels according to BMI, with a slight
increase in leptin as HOMA increased in normal weight women
(P = 0.05 for the HOMA  fenretinide interaction; Fig. 3C), as
opposed to a nonsignificant decrease in overweight women.

index according to disease status. The median HOMA index value

of unaffected high-risk women overlapped the HOMA index
reference value of 2.8, whereas women with intraepithelial or
microinvasive breast cancer had a median HOMA index equal to
3.0. This translated into a 24% increased risk of bearing an
intraepithelial or microinvasive breast cancer by unit increase in
HOMA index (P = 0.07).

Discussion
The metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by visceral
obesity, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and

dyslipidemia, has become a worldwide problem, and the mechanisms by which it promotes breast cancer development have
recently been elucidated (19). Increased levels of insulin and IGF-I
have been causally linked to breast cancer (20, 21), with
hyperinsulinemia, which in turn amplifies the bioavailability of
IGF-I (22). Insulin resistance develops as a metabolic adaptation to
increased levels of circulating nonesterified fatty acids released
from intra-abdominal adipose tissue that forces liver, muscles, and
other tissues to shift toward storage and oxidation of fats (9).
In our study, we found that overweight and obese women
taking fenretinide improved their HOMA-based insulin sensitivity

score. This benefit was associated with a decrease in plasma
leptin concentrations in overweight women as HOMA index
increased. Moreover, fenretinide prevented triglyceride increase
associated with HOMA increase in normal weight women. Leptin is
mainly produced by the adipocytes, conveys information to the
hypothalamus on the amount of energy stored in fat, and
suppresses appetite. It is a mitogen for various cell types, including normal and transformed breast epithelial cells (23, 24).
We found a highly positive correlation between leptin levels
and BMI in our cohort of premenopausal women. The relationships between obesity, leptin, insulin resistance, and mammary
tumor development are not fully understood. Genetically
obese, leptin-deficient mice, or mice lacking a functional leptin
receptor fail to develop oncogene-induced mammary tumors
(25, 26), but a direct association between high-circulating leptin
levels and breast cancer risk has not unequivocally been confirmed (27).
Interestingly, the insulin-sensitizing effect of fenretinide was
observed only after the second year of treatment, with a 7-fold
greater probability to improve insulin sensitivity compared with
women not taking fenretinide. We have no clear explanation
for this time lag, which suggests a gradual activity of the drug
on reversal of insulin-resistance and its persistence after treatment cessation. Fenretinide and N-(4-methoxyphenyl)retinamide,
the most abundant metabolite in human plasma, are lipophilic
and therefore accumulates in the adipose tissue where they are
retained for several months after drug cessation (17). Fenretinide
may enhance nuclear receptor heterodimerization promoting the
synthesis of lipids and carbohydrates possibly favoring insulin
sensitivity (28).
A putative link between fenretinide and insulin sensitivity may
be ascribed to the likely reduction in retinol-binding protein 4
(RBP4) levels after the decrease in retinol levels. RBP4 is an
adipocyte-secreted molecule that vehicles retinol in the blood
through a specific binding site and is associated with several
features of the metabolic syndrome (29). Improvement in insulin
action in insulin-resistant subjects after exercise training is
associated with a drop in serum RBP4 (30). Plasma concentrations
of RBP4 decrease proportionally with retinol (31), and their
decrease is highly correlated (r = 0.96) during fenretinide
administration (32). In our study, plasma retinol levels underwent
a 50% decrease at the first and second year of treatment, then
almost virtually recovered back to baseline values at the third year.
Although we were unable to measure RBP4 levels, we considered
the retinol decrease as a surrogate marker of serum RBP4 drop.
Serum levels of RBP4 are increased in insulin-resistant states
(11, 30, 33), although the correlation is attenuated with increasing age (34), and experiments in mice suggest that elevated RBP4
levels cause insulin resistance by reducing IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (11).
In contrast to fenretinide, low-dose tamoxifen was associated
with increased HOMA index in overweight women. Moreover,
tamoxifen worsened circulating levels of HDL-cholesterol and
triglycerides in overweight women as HOMA index increased.
Although several reports suggest that the predominant effects
of tamoxifen on lipids are favorable, especially on LDL cholesterol (2, 12, 13), hypertriglyceridemia during tamoxifen 20 mg/day
has been observed mostly in patients with family history of
dyslipidemia and high pretreatment triglyceride levels (35–37).

women in association with abnormal elevations of alanine
aminotransferase (38). In our study, we found that low-dose
tamoxifen exerted a greater increase of triglyceride levels with
increasing HOMA index, whereas there was no association between
triglycerides and HOMA index in women not taking tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is known to reduce the hepatic production in
IGF-I (2, 3). The drug also interacts with the IGF-I receptor
signaling pathway, down-regulating the down-stream cascade in
breast cancer cells, including insulin receptor substance-1 (IRS-1)
tyrosine phosphorylation (39, 40). One of the primary defects
underlying insulin resistance is an impairment in postreceptor
pathways of insulin action, bringing to a down-regulation of
IRS-1 signaling by excess free fatty acids (41). In addition, the
active metabolite 4-OH-tamoxifen may induce a marked inhibitory action on pancreatic h-cell function in a rat model (42).
Given the information above, we suggest that tamoxifen may
increase insulin requirement in women carrying features of the
metabolic syndrome. Although circulating SHBG and IGFBP-1
increase with tamoxifen treatment (2), a phenomenon expected
to positively influence insulin sensitivity, our data suggest that
in overweight women the insulin resistant effect of tamoxifen
is predominant.
We observed a border-line significant association between
HOMA index at baseline and disease status, which translated into
a 24% increased risk of having intraepithelial or microinvasive breast cancer by every unit of increase in HOMA index
relative to unaffected high-risk women (P = 0.07). This finding
is in line with the observation that postmenopausal breast
cancer patients with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes
have an increased risk of recurrence (43, 44), and that premenopausal women with features of the metabolic syndrome
(hyperandrogenism and luteal insufficiency) have an increased
breast cancer risk (45–47). As the prevalence of metabolic
syndrome is increasing steadily in the developing countries,
intervention aimed at preventing insulin-resistance and obesity represent important health issues also for breast cancer
prevention.
In conclusion, our results suggests that fenretinide positively
balance the metabolic profile in obese women, offering some clues
toward its evaluation in the treatment of metabolic syndrome.
In contrast, tamoxifen, even at a lower dose, worsened insulin
sensitivity in obese subjects, providing further support to its careful
use as a preventive agent in these women, where most serious
adverse events tend to occur, including endometrial cancer (48, 49)
and deep-vein thrombosis (50).
