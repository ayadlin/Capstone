Abstract
Net (Elk-3/SAP-2/Erp) is a transcription factor that is
phosphorylated and activated by the Ras–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling pathway and is involved
in wound healing, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. In a cellbased screen for small molecule inhibitors of Ras activation of
Net transcriptional activity, we identified a novel pyrazole,
XRP44X. XRP44X inhibits fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2)–
induced Net phosphorylation by the Ras-Erk signaling
upstream from Ras. It also binds to the colchicine-binding
site of tubulin, depolymerizes microtubules, stimulates cell
membrane blebbing, and affects the morphology of the actin
skeleton. Interestingly, Combretastin-A4, which produces
similar effects on the cytoskeleton, also inhibits FGF-2 RasNet signaling. This differs from other classes of agents that
target microtubules, which have either little effect (vincristine) or no effect (docetaxel and nocodazole) on the Ras-Net
pathway. XRP44X inhibits various cellular properties, including cell growth, cell cycle progression, and aortal sprouting,
similar to other molecules that bind to the tubulin colchicine
site. XRP44X has the potentially interesting property of
connecting two important pathways involved in cell transformation and may thereby represent an interesting class of
molecules that could be developed for cancer treatment.

Introduction
The Ras pathway is an attractive target for the development of
chemotherapeutic intervention. Human cancers frequently have
mutations in components of the Ras pathway, which result in
uncontrolled cell growth that is freed from regulation by
environmental signals (1–3). Ras links signals emanating from
receptor tyrosine kinases to downstream effectors, such as
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (Erk-1) and Erk-2, that
phosphorylate effectors, such as transcription factors of the
Ets family (4). Ets proteins are implicated in malignant transformation, and interestingly, ets gene fusions are frequently rearranged in human malignancies (5–7). We have focused on one of
the Ets factors that is regulated by Erk phosphorylation: Net (also
called Elk-3).

Net is an interesting downstream target of the Ras pathway,
which has an important role in physiologic and pathologic
processes, including wound healing, cell migration, angiogenesis,
and tumorigenesis (8–11). Net can be considered, thus, as a
relevant target for drug screens. Net, together with Elk-1 and Sap-1,
forms the ternary complex transcription factor subfamily (TCF),
which is notably known for their participation in the early response
of quiescent cells to growth factor stimulation (review ref. 12). Net
is a strong transcriptional repressor under basal conditions due
to the activities of two repressor domains, the NID and the CID
(Fig. 1A). Activation of the growth factor–Ras–mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway leads to Erk binding to the D and
F boxes and phosphorylation of Net on critical amino acids, such as
Ser363 in human Net, which converts the C domain into an efficient
transcription activation domain. A phosphorylated-specific antibody that recognizes this important modification has been
developed and shown to specifically stain transformed cells in
various human tumors, including prostate cancer (10).
In this study, we used the Ras-activated COOH terminal
domain of Net in a cell-based high-throughput screen to identify
inhibitors of the activity of the C-domain linked to a heterologous
DNA-binding domain and reporter construct. One of the
inhibitors, XRP44X, turned out to be a microtubule-depolymerizing
agent that interacts with the colchicine-binding site of tubulin.
Microtubules are dynamic components of the cytoskeleton, which
have a number of important functions related to movement of
both organelles during interphase and chromosomes during
mitosis. Microtubules are important targets for anticancer
therapy, and clinically successful microtubule ‘‘poisons’’ include
the taxanes and Vinca alkaloids (review refs. 13–15). Microtubules
are composed of heterodimers of a-tubulin and h-tubulin.
Tubulin-binding drugs can be classified according to the sites
on tubulin they bind. Most of the successful drugs target the
taxane-binding and Vinca-binding sites, and agents that target
the colchicine-binding site are being developed [e.g., combretastatin prodrugs, such as combretastatin A4 (CA4)–phosphate and
combretastatin-serine (AVE8062)]. Tubulin-binding drugs can also
be classified according to whether they stabilize microtubules and
stimulate polymerization (e.g., taxanes) or destabilize microtubules and inhibit polymerization (e.g., Vinca alkaloids, nocodazole, and combretastatins). The primary antineoplastic activity of
the drugs is thought to result from the failure of cells to segregate
chromosomes during mitosis. However, at least part of their
activity could result from nonmitotic effects in interphase cells.
These additional effects may help explain some of the differences
between the activities of microtubule ‘‘poisons’’ and may help in
the development of improved drugs. In particular, drugs that
target the colchicine domain, such as combretastatins, act as
vascular-disrupting agents.

Interestingly, XRP44X was found to have many properties in
common with CA4, such as antimitotic and vasculature-disrupting
effects (16). Here, we report that it also inhibits Net activity and
phosphorylation by its negative effects on the Ras signaling
pathway, a property shared with CA4 and but not with docetaxel
and nocodazole. It also inhibits the growth of transformed cells in
culture and angiogenesis in an ex vivo assay of endothelial cell
sprouting. Our studies provide evidence for a novel pathway for
regulation of Ras-MAPK signaling and identify a new molecule that
may be useful for the development of cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
For details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Recombinants. Net, Gal4-N6, Gal4-N5, 8xPal-TK-Luc, Ha-Ras, and pCMV
LacZ (17, 18) are used in the study.
Compound library screen. The cell-based assays used dual reporter
gene read-outs. The test HCT116 reporter clone (Ras-Net) expresses Gal4Net (220–409), Gal4 UAS–Renilla luciferase, and Ras Val12 (to enhance
reporter gene expression). The control SW480 cell clone expresses h-catenin
that activates firefly luciferase expression from a Tcf/Lef-dependent
promoter. The cells in 384-well plates were treated with compounds
(500,000) for 24 h before measuring the luciferases.
Transient transfections. NIH3T3 cells were transfected using the
calcium phosphate technique; luciferase and control h-galactosidase
activities were assayed. Fold activation relative to control vectors was
determined in three experiments with two plasmid preparations.
Treatment with compounds and fibroblast growth factor 2. Cells
were grown overnight from 80% to 90% confluence, incubated in 0.05%
(NIH3T3) or 0.1% (human umbilical vascular endothelial cell, HUVEC)
serum for 4 h, treated with compounds for 3 h (NIH3T3) or 1.5 h (HUVEC),
20 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) for 1 to 90 min, and lysed in
Laemmli buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription–PCR. Total RNA was
used. Primers were designed with Oligo 4.0. Amplification specificity was
verified by melting curve analysis, and the data were quantified with
LightCycler software. The controls for genomic DNA contamination were
not reverse transcribed.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (5). March 1, 2008

Western blotting and antibodies. Cells were harvested in Laemmli
buffer, fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes, incubated with primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibodies, and revealed with SuperSignal Pico West
(Pierce).
Ras activation assay. The Ras activation assay kit (Cytoskeleton, BK008)
was used. The controls for loading and signaling pathway activation used
cell lysates before affinity chromatography and Western blotting for
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphorylated
Erk-1/2, respectively.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cells were grown, synchronized
in low serum (0.1% for NIH3T3) overnight, treated with compounds for
20 h in medium with serum (10% FCS for NIH3T3), and analyzed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (19) and the CellQuest program
(Becton Dickinson). The experiments were repeated at least thrice with 5
to 500 nmol/L XRP44X.
Mouse aortic ring angiogenesis assay. Thoracic aortas sections (1-mm
long) from 8-week-old 129/PAS mice were placed in Matrigel, incubated for
48 h in EGM-2-MV (CC-3202, Clonetics), followed by 3 days in fresh EBM-2MV containing various compounds. Microvessel sprouts were examined by
biomicroscopy and a Cool SNAP camera. The experiments were repeated
thrice.
Cell proliferation. Cells (2  103 per well) were seeded in 96-well plates
allowed to attach for 12 h. Growth curves were from 10 nmol/L compounds
for samples every 24 h. For IC50 values, at logarithmically increasing
amounts of compounds, samples were analyzed after 2 (HCT-116 and
NIH3T3–Ki-Ras) or 3 days (HUVEC and NIH3T3). The WTS-8 cell counting
kit was used (Alexis Biochemical). The experiments were repeated thrice,
with six wells per condition in each experiment. IC50 values were
determined by curve fitting (MatLab) and semilogarithmic plotting.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells on coverslips were treated with
compounds, fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1), and revealed with
phosphorylated Net (P-Net) or h-tubulin monoclonal antibodies followed
by FITC-conjugated antimouse antibodies. For actin, the cells were fixed
with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and treated
with Texas red–conjugated phalloidin. Nuclei were stained with 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma).

Results
A high throughput cell-based screen for inhibitors of Rasinduced transcription activation. To identify small molecules
that inhibit Ras oncogene–induced Net transcription activation, a
HCT116 reporter cell line was established (HCT116-Net-Ras). It
expresses two proteins, oncogenic Ha-Ras and the Net-Ras
responsive transcription activation domain (215–409) fused to
the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-N5; Fig. 1A), and in addition,
it contains a Gal4 UAS-Renilla luciferase reporter. A counterscreening SW480 cell line was produced containing the Firefly
luciferase gene under the control of a h-catenin/T-cell factor
promoter sequence (data not shown). A library of small molecules
was screened, resulting in the identification of XRP44X, a 3piperazinylcarbonyl-pyrazole (Fig. 1B) that inhibited Ras-induced
transcription activation (IC50, 10 F 6.5 nmol/L; Supplementary
Table S1) with little effect on the h-catenin/T-cell factor–
dependent transcription activation (IC50, >3,000 nmol/L). The
properties of XRP44X were studied in comparison with its
regioisomer XRP45X and with the related molecule XRP57X and
its regioisomer XRP58X.
The effects of these compounds on Net activity were investigated
using the HCT116-Net-Ras reporter cell line (Supplementary Table
S1). XRP44X inhibited luciferase activity more efficiently than its
regioisomer XRP45X (IC50, f10 and 700 nmol/L, respectively), the
related molecule XRP57X (IC50, f80 nmol/L), and its regioisomer

XRP58X (IC50, f1,500 nmol/L). These values were determined
from dose-response curves and reflect true differences rather than
‘‘plateau effects.’’ The effects were not merely due to general
cytotoxicity, because there was no significant variation in the total
protein concentration extracted from the cultures and the compounds had no effect on the h-catenin/T-cell factor–responsive
cell line. To test the effect of XRP44X on the activity of full-length
Net, transfection experiments in NIH3T3 fibroblasts were used. A
Ras-responsive reporter (Palx8-TK-Luc; ref. 17) was cotransfected
with expression vectors for Net, Ha-Ras-Val12 to activate Net, and
h-galactosidase as an internal control. XRP44X inhibited Net
activity to a greater extent than the other compounds (Supplementary Table S1). The Erk-1/2 pathway inhibitor U0126, which
inhibits Net phosphorylation and activation (10), also decreased
luciferase activity. General toxicity could not account for the
effects of the compounds because there was no significant
variation in h-galactosidase activity. These results indicate that
XRP44X inhibits Ras-induced activation of Net efficiently and
specifically.
XRP44X inhibits Net phosphorylation. Growth factors stimulate the Ras-Erk-TCF pathway rapidly and transiently, leading to
changes in gene expression (20). We investigated the effect of
XRP44X on FGF-2 induction of the endogenous c-fos and egr-1
genes by quantitative real-time reverse transcription–PCR. Mouse
fibroblasts (NIH3T3 cells) were pretreated for 3 h with 100 nmol/L
XRP44X, treated with FGF-2 for 40 min, and analyzed for c-fos and
egr-1 RNA expression. XRP44X inhibited expression of both genes
by f65% (Supplementary Table S2). HUVECs were studied more
extensively (Supplementary Fig. S1) to determine the effects on the
time course (A and B) and the dose dependency (C and D). Fifty
percent inhibition of egr-1 and 65% of c-fos were observed with
200 nmol/L XRP44X 60 min after FGF-2 induction (C and D). The
extent of inhibition was similar after 30 min (A and B). There were
no significant variations in 28S RNA levels, showing that the
decrease was not due to nonspecific effects. Taken together, these
results indicate that the 3-piperazinylcarbonyl-pyrazole XRP44X
inhibits transcription activation induced by the growth factor–RasNet pathway.
Because c-fos and egr-1 are Net target genes and Net is activated
by Erk phosphorylation, we investigated whether inhibition
resulted from effects on Net phosphorylation. Growth factors
stimulate phosphorylation of the COOH terminal domain of Net
through the Ras-Erk pathway. Phosphorylation of Ser363, which is
one of the most important phosphorylation sites for activation of
the COOH terminal domain, was followed using the MAb2F3
phosphorylated-specific antibody (10, 21). Normal HUVEC were
serum starved for 24 h and treated with 20 ng/mL FGF-2 and Net
phosphorylation, followed by Western blotting with the phosphorylated-specific antibody (Fig. 2A). Net phosphorylation was
detected after 5 min (lane 4), was maximal after 10 min (lane 5),
and gradually declined up to 45 min (lane 8). There was a shift in
mobility of Net that could be correlated with the intensity of the
bands, as might be expected from the phosphorylation of several
sites on Net (10, 21). Changes in intensity of the bands were
reproducibly observed in HUVEC and other cell lines (NIH3T3
mouse fibroblasts, C6 rat glioma, LL/2 mouse Lewis lung
carcinoma, SEND skin endothelial cells transformed with polyoma
middle T and HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, but not NIH3T3–KiRas and PC3 prostate carcinoma cells; Supplementary Fig. S2 and
data not shown), whereas the shift was more variable and
depended on the cell line used, the particular conditions of

electrophoresis and the initial state of phosphorylation of Net
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and data not shown). Similar to Net, the
related protein Elk-1 has been extensively characterized and shown
to have several phosphorylation sites of varying importance for
transcription activation (22). In some experiments, the 2F3
phosphorylated-specific antibody detects additional nonidentified
bands in HUVEC cells (Fig. 2; see also Supplementary Fig. S2A and
B). The identities of these bands are not known and could
correspond to other modified forms of Net or other proteins. They
do not compromise the identification of the P-Net bands nor the
interpretations of the experiments, which have been repeated a
large number of times in HUVEC and in a number of other cell
lines.

To investigate whether the compound inhibited Net phosphorylation, HUVEC cells were pretreated with 100 nmol/L XRP44X
for 90 min and then treated with FGF-2. XRP44X clearly inhibited
Net phosphorylation by f80%, without affecting the kinetics of
the residual phosphorylation that could still be detected (Fig. 2A,
lanes 17–21). XRP44X treatment alone did not induce Net
phosphorylation (lanes 22–26). The total levels of Net, detected
with an antibody raised against the COOH terminal region of Net
(polyclonal antibody 2005), did not significantly change during the
course of the experiment (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–12; data not shown).
There was a shift in the mobility (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–12) that
coincided with the shift observed with the phosphorylatedspecific antibody and probably reflects the effect of phosphorylation on migration once FGF-2 is added to the cells. The levels of
the loading control GAPDH remained constant (Fig. 2A, lanes
1–26). Inhibition of Net phosphorylation was observed with a
range of concentrations of XRP44X (20 nmol/L–5 Amol/L; data
not shown). XRP44X was also found to inhibit Net phosphorylation in other cell lines, including NIH3T3 fibroblasts, C6 glioma
cells, LL/2, and SEND (Supplementary Fig. S2). In NIH3T3
cells, preincubation in the absence or presence of XRP44X for
up to 180 min did not affect the levels of Net protein (polyclonal
antibody 375; Supplementary Fig. S2C, lanes 1–12). Similarly,
preincubation with the Mek inhibitor U0126 inhibited Net
phosphorylation without affecting total Net protein (Supplementary Fig. S2D, lanes 1–4). XRP45X, XRP57X, and XRP58X were
considerably less efficient than XRP44X in inhibition of Net
phosphorylation induced by FGF-2 (Supplementary Fig. S2B, lanes
5–10). These results show that XRP44X inhibits Net prosphorylation without altering total protein levels.
Net phosphorylation was also evaluated by immunocytochemistry of HUVEC with MAb2F3 (Fig. 2D). FGF-2 treatment for 10 min
led to a clearly detectable increase in P-Net in cell nuclei. This
staining was more intense than in cells pretreated for 90 min with
XRP44X. The remaining detectable P-Net in XRP44X-treated cells
was still mainly located in the nucleus. Similar results were
obtained in NIH3T3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). The results from
Western blotting and immunocytochemistry show that XRP44X
inhibits Net phosphorylation on Ser363 in the nuclei of cells.
XRP44X inhibits FGF-2 activation of the Erk-1/2 pathway.
We have previously shown that FGF-2 stimulates Net phosphorylation through the Erk-1/2 pathway (10), raising the possibility
that XRP44X inhibits this signaling cascade. Erk-1/2 activation
involves formation of Ras-GTP, Raf recruitment, sequential
phosphorylation, activation of Raf-1, Mek-1/2, and Erk-1/2, and
finally phosphorylation by Erk-1/2 substrates, such as Rsk (23), as
well as Net. We tested whether XRP44X affects this cascade.
XRP44X inhibited phosphorylation of Rsk-1 (Fig. 3A), showing that
XRP44X is not a specific inhibitor of Net phosphorylation. XRP44X
inhibited phosphorylation of Erk-1/2 on sites required for its
activation without affecting overall levels of Erk-1/2 (Fig. 3A).
Furthermore, it inhibited phosphorylation of Mek-1/2 and Raf-1
(Fig. 3A) and activation of Ras (Fig. 3B; see also Fig. 6C). Because
the observation that XRP44X inhibits Ras activation is important,
we also measured Ras activation with an ELISA-based assay. In
time course experiments, maximum Ras activation was observed
after 5 min (Supplementary Fig. S4), in agreement with the pulldown assays (Fig. 3B). In dose-response experiments, maximum
inhibition was observed with 100 nmol/L XRP44X. These results
show that XRP44X is an indirect inhibitor of Net phosphorylation
that acts upstream from Erk-1/2 activation. This is not necessarily

Figure 3. XRP44X inhibits activation of the Ras–Erk-1/2 pathway by FGF-2.
A, activation of the Raf-1–Erk-1/2 cascade. HUVEC cells were incubated for
4 h in low serum (0.1% FCS), pretreated with XRP44X (100 nmol/L) or vehicle
(DMSO) for 90 min, and then induced with FGF-2 (20 ng/mL) for 0 to 45 min.
Extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for phosphorylation of p90Rsk
(P-Rsk ; Thr359/Ser363), Erk-1/2 (P-Erk-1/2 , Thr202/Tyr204), Mek1/2 (P-Mek1/2 ,
Ser217/221), Raf-1 (P-Raf1 , Ser338). Total Erk-1/2 and GAPDH were controls.
B, Ras activation. To estimate the potential range of conversion of inactive
Ras-GDP to active Ras-GTP, extracts from HUVEC growing in complete medium
with FCS were loaded with excess GTP-g-S (lane 1 ) and GDP (lane 2), and
proteins ‘‘pulled down’’ with Raf-RBD beads were analyzed by Western blotting
for Ras. To measure the kinetics of Ras activation by FGF-2, HUVEC cells were
incubated for 16 h in low serum (0.1% FCS) and induced with FGF-2 (20 ng/mL)
for 0 to 15 min (lanes 3–7 ). To study the effects of XRP44X on
Ras activation, HUVEC cells were incubated for 16 h in low serum (0.1% FCS),
preincubated with XRP44X or vehicle for 90 min, and induced with FGF-2
(20 ng/mL) for 5 min (lanes 8–10 ).

unexpected, considering that a cell-based screen and a functional
readout were used to isolate XRP44X.
XRP44X inhibits microvessel sprouting from aorta in
organ cultures and cell growth. The mechanisms by which
XRP44X inhibits the Ras-Erk pathway was investigated further
using a variety of assays that led to insights into its activities.
One of these approaches was to study cellular processes that are
regulated by Net, including microvessel sprouting from aorta in
organ culture and cell growth (10). In the aorta ring assay
(Fig. 4A), XRP44X inhibited microvessel sprouting when the aorta
were incubated with 5 nmol/L XRP44X for 3 days (compare
panels 1 and 3). The inhibition was greater when 50 nmol/L
XRP44X was used (panel 5). To study regrowth after removal of
the inhibitor, XRP44X was soaked out of the semisolid medium
by washing and adding fresh medium lacking XRP44X to the
50 nmol/L XRP44X cultures. Microvessel sprouting was clearly
restimulated (panel 8), showing that regrowth was possible when
the concentration of XRP44X was decreased. Inhibition of aortic
sprouting by XRP44X was observed in three different experiments with three aorta cultures per treatment and 5, 10, 20, and
50 nmol/L XRP44X (data not shown). As a positive control, the
mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase 1/2 inhibitor U0126 was
shown to inhibit microvessel sprouting (panels 2 and 4), and

washing out the inhibitor restored growth (compare panel 7 with
panel 6), as expected from the known role of Erk-1/2 signaling in
aortic sprouting (24).
The effect of XRP44X on the growth of endothelial cells (HUVEC)
was followed with a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (WTS-8). XRP44X inhibited
their growth (Fig. 4B), with an IC50 of f2 nmol/L (Supplementary
Table S3). XRP44X also inhibited the growth of immortalized
mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 4C), the human tumor cell line used to

develop the HTS target cell line (HCT-116; Fig. 4D), and the Ki-Ras
transformed cell line derived from the NIH3T3 cell line clone
shown (Fig. 4E). The IC50 values for the endothelial cells, the
human tumor cell line, and the transformed fibroblast line were
similar. The nontransformed fibroblasts used for Ki-Ras transformation had a slightly higher IC50 (Supplementary Table S3),
indicating that Ki-Ras transformation might increase the sensitivity
to XRP44X. The antiproliferative activity of XRP44X relative to the
related compounds (XRP45X, XRP57X, and XRP58X) was measured

incubated for 2 d. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing vehicle (panels 1 and 6 ), U0126 (panels 2, 4, and 7 ), or XRP44X (panels 3, 5, and 8),
as indicated. After 4 d, the cultures were photographed (panels 1–5 ), washed thrice, incubated for a further 2 d without compounds, and photographed (panels 6–8 ).
B–E, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2  103 per well), allowed to attach, and, after 12 h, treated with 10 nmol/L of XRPX44X or CA4, and proliferation was
measured with the WTS-8 assay every 24 h for 4 d (top graphs ). The effects of different concentrations of the compounds on proliferation were measured after 3 d for
HUVEC and NIH3T3 (B, C ) and 2 d for HCT-116 and NIH3T3–Ki-Ras (D, E ).

with a thymidine incorporation assay on various cell lines derived
from the most common human tumors. XRP44X inhibited
proliferation more efficiently than its regioisomer XRP45X, and
the related molecule XRP57X and its regioisomer XRP58X
(Supplementary Table S4). These results show that XRP44X
specifically inhibits growth of cells derived from many common

XRP44X leads to G2-M cell cycle arrest and alters the
tubulin and actin cytoskeletons. The mechanisms by which
XRP44X affects cell growth were examined further using cell
cycle analysis, visual inspection, and immunocytochemistry in
various cell types, especially NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HUVEC
endothelial cells. For FACS analysis, NIH3T3 cells were
synchronized by incubation overnight in medium containing
0.1% FCS. They were then incubated in high serum (10% FCS) in
the presence of vehicle (control), 50 nmol/L XRP44X, or XRP45X.
The treatment with XRP44X resulted in the accumulation of cells
in the G2-M phase in comparison with XRP45X or control
(Fig. 5A), which is compatible with the observed inhibition of
cell growth (see above; similar results were obtained with
HUVEC and several other cell lines; data not shown). Cells were
visually inspected by phase contrast microscopy. HUVEC were
incubated in the conditions used to analyze signal transduction
(see above), namely 4 h in low serum followed by 90 min with
50 nmol/L XRP44X or XRP45X, fixed, and observed under the
microscope (Fig. 5B, visible). XRP44X was found to induce
‘‘blebbing’’ of the cell surface in contrast to XRP45X (data not
shown) or vehicle control. Similar effects were observed with
NIH3T3 and other cell lines (data not shown). These changes are
reminiscent of CA4, which has effects on both tubulin microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton (25–27). Immunocytochemistry was used to examine microtubules using antibodies against
h-tubulin. Treatment of HUVEC cells with XRP44X led to
disorganization of the tubulin microtubules in contrast to
XRP45X (data not shown) and the control (Fig. 5B). This effect
of XRP44X is similar to the effects already described for CA4
(25–27) and reproduced in Fig. 5B. We then compared the
effects of XRP44X and CA4 on Filamentous actin (F-actin) using
rhodamine-phalloidine (Fig. 5C). Both compounds had similar
effects on the actin cytoskeleton, leading to the formation of
actin-lined cell surface protrusions (blebs). Similar effects on the
actin cytoskeleton were observed in NIH3T3 (data not shown).
Using FACS analysis, we also confirmed that CA4 blocked cells
in the G2-M phase, similar to XRP44X (data not shown). CA4
binds to the colchicine site and depolymerizes microtubules (27).
We showed that XRP44X binds to the same site as CA4 on
tubulin and also depolymerizes microtubules (Supplementary
Table S5). We also showed that CA4 inhibits proliferation of
HUVEC, NIH3T3, HCT-116, and NIH3T3–Ki-Ras (Fig. 4B–E), with
IC50 values similar to XRP44X (Supplementary Table S3). These
results show that XRP44X and CA4 have similar effects on cells
and may act by similar mechanisms.
CA4 efficiently inhibits Net phosphorylation and activation
of the Erk pathway by FGF-2 in contrast to docetaxel,
vincristine, or nocodazole. Tubulin-interacting molecules bind
to different sites and have different effects on microtubules (28).
We compared the effects of XRP44X with CA4 that binds to the
same site of tubulin, as well as with docetaxel that interacts with
the taxane site and stabilizes microtubules and vincristine that
interacts with the Vinca site and blocks tubulin assembly.
HUVEC cells were treated for 90 min with increasing amounts

was examined by Western blotting (Fig. 6A). CA4 inhibited
Net phosphorylation at similar concentrations as XRP44X (IC50,
f20 nmol/L; Fig. 6A, lanes 1–12). In contrast, docetaxel did not
affect Net phosphorylation, even when the concentration was
increased to much higher levels than XRP44X or CA4 (lanes
13–18). Vincristine also had little effect on Net phosphorylation

(lanes 19–24; IC50, z1 Amol/L). We tested nocodazole that also
binds to the colchicine site. We found that nocodazole was
significantly less efficient than XRP44X in inhibiting Net
phosphorylation (lanes 25–30). The compounds did not affect
the amounts of the internal control (GAPDH; data not shown).
Similar results were obtained in NIH3T3 cells (Supplementary
Table S6 and Supplementary Fig. S5).
We also tested whether CA4 affects the Erk signaling cascade
(Fig. 6B and C). CA4 inhibited FGF-2–induced expression of egr-1
and c-fos (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B) to a similar extent as
XRP44X and with a similar dose response (Supplementary Fig. S1E
and F). CA4 also inhibited phosphorylation of Rsk, Erk-1/2,
Mek-1, and Raf-1 (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–13; the inhibition of Raf-1 by
XRP44X and CA4 was confirmed by quantification of scans and
correction for the internal control GAPDH; data not shown). CA4
also inhibited activation of Ras (Fig. 6C). We confirmed the
inhibition of Ras activation using an ELISA assay (Supplementary
Fig. S4). In contrast, docetaxel did not inhibit, but rather had a
small positive effect on Erk-1/2 activation that was observed in this
and some other experiments (Fig. 6B, lanes 14–20; data not shown).

Similarly, nocodazole had no prominent effect on the Erk signaling
cascade under these conditions (lanes 21–26; data not shown). In
line with the positive effect of docetaxel on Erk-1/2, it was found to
increase FGF-2 induction of the endogenous c-fos and egr-1 genes
(Supplementary Table S2). Docetaxel and U0126 (that inhibits
Mek-1) did not affect Ras activation (Fig. 6C; data not shown).
These results provide evidence that XRP44X and CA4 have similar
mechanisms, which are not common to other classes of tubulin
binders and even to nocodazole that belongs to colchicine site
binder class.

Discussion
We have identified an inhibitor of Ras-induced transcription
activation through the MAPK pathway. It inhibits growth factor–
induced gene expression through the Erk signaling pathway,
alters the morphology of microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton, affects transcription regulation, and blocks cell cycle
progression and microvessel sprouting. Different mechanisms
may contribute to the effects observed in these short, medium,

antibodies. C, inhibition of Ras activation. HUVEC cells were incubated for 16 h in low serum (0.1% FCS), 90 min with 100 nmol/L XRP44X, docetaxel, CA4, or

control). The activation state of Ras was determined by ‘‘pull down’’ with RBD beads and Western blotting with a pan-Ras antibody.

and long-term assays. One of the interesting properties is that it
is a microtubule poison, a class of molecules already successfully
used in cancer treatment. Microtubule poisons have different
effects and fall into distinct classes based on their effects on
tubulin and microtubule dynamics and also on ‘‘additional’’
effects that are increasingly being investigated. Understanding
these, ‘‘secondary’’ pathways are important for the design and
optimum use of cancer therapeutics.
The inhibitor XRP44X was identified in a cell-based screen for
decreased luciferase activity driven by Ras-induced activation of
Net. XRP44X is an efficient inhibitor of Ras-Erk–mediated
phosphorylation of Net (IC50, 10–20 nmol/L). Compound inhibitory
activity is structurally specific because the regioisomer XRP45X and
close analogues (XRP57X and XRP58X) are much less efficient. The
screen was focused on the Ras-Net pathway, with a counter
selection for compounds that affected the h-catenin/T-cell factor
pathway. In short-term transfections, XRP44X inhibited Rasinduced activation of both the fusion proteins used in the original
screen (Gal4-N5; data not shown), as well as full-length Net with a
different reporter, without having an effect on the internal control.
XRP44X also inhibited the expression of several endogenous genes
that are induced by the Ras-Erk pathway, c-fos and egr-1. These
results indicate that XRP44X is relatively selective and specific in its
effects.
We investigated the mechanisms by which XRP44X affects the
Ras-Net pathway. The COOH terminal domain of Net used in the
screen is activated by Erk phosphorylation on Ser363, which can
be followed with a phosphorylated-specific antibody (21).
Treatment of different cell types with XRP44X inhibited
phosphorylation of endogenous Net on Ser363. We traced the
origins of the inhibition by working backwards along the
pathway. Net is regulated by nuclear export in response to
several stress-induced pathways (29). Net remained in the nucleus
under the conditions used (see Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S3 and
data not shown), indicating that XRP44X did not significantly
induce export of Net but rather suggesting that it inhibited Erk1/2 activity. Erks are activated by phosphorylation in the
cytoplasm, and they, in turn, phosphorylate cytoplasmic proteins
and nuclear proteins after migration into the nucleus (30).
Inhibition of nuclear import of Erk-1/2 could have led to
decreased phosphorylation of Net, which is found in the nucleus.
However, we did not observe effects on nuclear import (data not
shown) in agreement with other studies (review ref. 31). We
showed that phosphorylation of Erk was inhibited and that the
remaining detectable activated Erk-1/2 was found in both the
cytoplasm and nucleus, using immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation (see above and data not shown). These results
indicated that the major effect of XRP44X was upstream from
Erk-1/2. We traced the inhibition upstream through Mek1/2,
Raf-1, and Ras-GTP, showing that XRP44X inhibits Ras activation.
This inhibition could come from effects of XRP44X on the
cytoskeleton. Cell staining for actin and tubulin showed
alterations in cytoskeletal architecture. XRP44X stimulates
microtubule depolymerization in vitro and competes with
colchicine for binding to tubulin. CA4 has similar effects on
the cytoskeleton and microtubules (27, 32, 33), inhibits the RasNet signaling pathway (this study), and induces early membrane
blebbing through a mechanism that involves activated Erks (25),
suggesting that they act by similar mechanisms. Interestingly,
nocodazole, which also belongs to colchicine ‘‘binder’’ class of
compounds, does not inhibit the Ras-Net signaling pathway,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (5). March 1, 2008

demonstrating that microtubule depolymerization can be
uncoupled from inhibition of this pathway.
Despite f20 years of research since the original isolation and
synthesis of CA4 (34), the precise mechanisms by which it operates
are incompletely understood. Importantly, CA4 has been shown to
rapidly activate the small GTPase Rho and Rho-kinase (25). In line
with this, we have found that XRP44X affects ezrin expression and
phosphorylation, using macroarrays and phosphorylated-specific
antibodies (data not shown). Ezrin belongs to the ezrin/radixin/
moesin (ERM) family of actin binding proteins that act as signal
transducers in response to cytoskeleton remodeling. ERM proteins
are linked to Rho signaling through several pathways (35). Further
studies focused on already described endogenous inhibitors of the
Ras-Erk pathway (review ref. 36) may help to unravel the molecular
mechanism by which CA4 and XRP44X selectively affect cellular
signaling.
As expected for a microtubule poison, XRP44X in cell culture
inhibits cell proliferation and leads to the accumulation of cells in
the G2-M phase without obvious cell type specificity. XRP44X
inhibits sprouting from aorta in ex vivo experiments (see above).
XRP44X behaves as a typical tubulin poison that binds to the
colchicine-binding site. The effects of XRP44X are very similar to
those described for combretastatins (review ref. 27), suggesting by
analogy that XRP44X is potentially a vascular-disrupting agent.
Interestingly, we have shown that Net is expressed at sites of
angiogenesis and tumorigenesis during development and has a role
in angiogenesis in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays (8–10),
suggesting that targeting Net in the screen for XRP44X favored
selection of a vascular-disrupting agent. However, XRP44X, like
combretastatins, is not specific for endothelial cells, and the
relative importance of its effects on different cell types (endothelial
cells, tumor cells) in inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis
remains to be established.
Many microtubule-targeted drugs have been described, and
microtubules are good targets for anticancer therapy (review refs.
13, 14). The drugs bind to different sites on tubulin, in particular
the taxane, Vinca, and colchicine domains. Taxanes stabilize
microtubules, whereas Vinca alkaloids, nocodazole, combretastatins, and XRP44X destabilize microtubules (Supplementary Table
S6). Differences in their effects on microtubules are probably
reflected in the biological properties of the drugs. We found that
docetaxel did not inhibit Ras-Net signaling, and vincristine was
much less efficient (IC50, f1 Amol/L). Our results agree with
other studies that show that paclitaxel does not inhibit MAPK
activation (37, 38). Furthermore, we found that docetaxel has a
slight positive effect on c-fos expression in contrast to XRP44X.
Similar effects on c-fos expression and associated activation of
Erk-1/2 have been described recently (39, 40). Taxoids and
microtubule-destabilizing agents have opposite effects on c-myc
oncogene expression in some cell types (41) through mechanisms
involving nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB; ref. 42). They have been
reported to use the NF-nB pathway to stabilize HIF-1a, a factor
that is important for wound healing and angiogenesis by
regulation of cell response to hypoxia (43). Interestingly, Net is
also implicated in wound healing, angiogenesis, and the response
to hypoxia (refs. 8–10; data not shown), indicating that MDAs
may regulate several different pathways that are important in
common physiologic processes. Knowledge of the differences in
transcription factor control by microtubule-targeted drugs may
be used to increase their therapeutic potential. Fascinatingly, the
therapeutic efficacy of Paclitaxel can be enhanced by inhibition

of the Erk activator Mek in nude mice bearing human
heterotransplants (44), and its ability to induce apoptosis can
be enhanced by inhibition of NF-nB (45). The differences in the
efficiencies of inhibition of the Ras-Net pathway by docetaxel,
vincristine, and CA4/XRP44X could be a consequence of them
binding to different sites on tubulin. However, another colchicines-binding compound, nocodazole, did not inhibit the pathway
efficiently.
In conclusion, this study shows that, among microtubule
poisons, XRP44X and CA4 constitute an original class of drugs,
which combine two anticancer clinically validated mechanisms:
antimitotic and signaling pathway inhibitory activities (46).
