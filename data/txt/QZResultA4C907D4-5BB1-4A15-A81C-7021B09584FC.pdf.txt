Abstract
There is a need for biomarkers that are useful for noninvasive imaging of tumor pathophysiology and drug
efﬁcacy. Through its use of endogenous water, diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) can be used to probe local
tissue architecture and structure. However, most DW-MRI studies of cancer tissues have relied on simplistic
mathematical models, such as apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) or intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)
models, which produce equivocal results on the relation of the model parameter estimate with the underlying
tissue microstructure. Here, we present a novel technique called VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular and
Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumors) to quantify and map histologic features of tumors in vivo.
VERDICT couples DW-MRI to a mathematical model of tumor tissue to access features such as cell size,
vascular volume fraction, intra- and extracellular volume fractions, and pseudo-diffusivity associated with
blood ﬂow. To illustrate VERDICT, we used two tumor xenograft models of colorectal cancer with different
cellular and vascular phenotypes. Our experiments visualized known differences in the tissue microstructure
of each model and the signiﬁcant decrease in cell volume resulting from administration of the cytotoxic drug
gemcitabine, reﬂecting the apoptotic volume decrease. In contrast, the standard ADC and IVIM models
failed to detect either of these differences. Our results illustrate the superior features of VERDICT for
cancer imaging, establishing it as a noninvasive method to monitor and stratify treatment responses. Cancer

Introduction
Classical histology provides the gold standard for diagnosis of cancer, offering the sole method to access speciﬁc
information on the cellular architecture of tissue such as the
viability of cells, their size, and packing density. However,
histology requires invasive extraction of the tissue, typically
through biopsy, and is generally limited to small sampling
regions. Noninvasive techniques, such as MRI and computed
tomography, are widely used in clinical research for tumor
detection and for measuring progression and regression via
gross volumetric changes. However, such changes in tumor
size can take many weeks or months to occur, and more
sensitive imaging techniques for probing the tumor micro-

environment before and following therapy are urgently
required.
Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) of tumors is increasingly
used as a research tool, both for diagnostic imaging (1) and
measuring response to therapy (2). It is sensitive to the
displacement of water particles at length scales much smaller
than the image resolution and as water mobility is inﬂuenced
by interactions with cellular structures, DW-MRI can be used
to infer information about the local tissue architecture for the
whole tumor. Most studies have used the technique in its
simplest form by summarizing water mobility via the apparent
diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC; refs. 1–4) often assuming that
reduced ADC reﬂects increased cellularity. However, while
some studies have found a negative correlation between tumor
ADC and cellularity (1, 3), others have found no such correlation (4, 5). The inconsistency most likely arises because ADC
is a gross measurement that conﬂates various physiologic
parameters, including cell density, size, shape, permeability,
subcellular architecture, and vascular perfusion effects. These
biophysical mechanisms affect the ADC in different ways that
can compete and even cancel each other, confounding overall
speciﬁcity.
Model-based DW-MRI approaches can potentially separate
these effects to provide estimates of speciﬁc histologic features
and thus offer a much richer description of the underlying
tissue on which to base a diagnosis or grade assessment. This
has proven successful in brain imaging, where geometric
models of brain tissue predict the measured signal more

Noninvasive Quantiﬁcation Tumor Tissue with VERDICT MRI

accurately than simple ADC models and provide estimates of
speciﬁc tissue features, such as ﬁber orientation distribution,
diameter distribution, and packing density (6–9). A few early
attempts to model the diffusion signal in a similar way in
tumors exist. The intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model
(10) assumes that tissue water resides in two nonexchanging
compartments: vascular (pseudo-diffusing water inside blood
vessels) and nonvascular (diffusing water in and around cells).
IVIM has been used to study various cancer types, such as
breast (11), prostate (12), pancreatic (13), and kidney (14)
tumors, showing improvement in data description compared
with the ADC. However, while the IVIM model acknowledges
and separates out the additional signal from vascular water, its
description of diffusion in the cellular component of the tissue
remains simplistic; just as for the ADC, it does not account
for cellular geometry and compartmentalization. Xu and
colleagues (15) used a geometric tissue model of cancer cells
with computer simulations to demonstrate the limitation of
considering ADC alone, but made no attempt to estimate the
model parameters from measured data.
Here, we propose a noninvasive imaging paradigm, called
VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Diffusion for
Cytometry in Tumors), for quantifying microstructural features of tumors, in vivo, and demonstrate its use in two wellcharacterized tumor xenograft models of colorectal cancer.
The VERDICT model includes the three primary components:
(i) vascular, (ii) extracellular–extravascular space (EES), and
(iii) intracellular water that inﬂuence the DW-MRI signal and
exist in a wide range of tumors. Fitting the model to DW-MRI
datasets with various diffusion times and diffusion weightings
(see Materials and Methods) provides estimates of the size and
packing density of the cells, the vascular and EES volume
fractions as well as the pseudo-diffusion coefﬁcient associated
with blood ﬂow. The aims of the study are: (i) to compare the
VERDICT model with current models (ADC and IVIM); (ii) to
investigate the accuracy of VERDICT parameter estimates in
representative tissue samples (colorectal xenograft models) by
comparison with histology; (iii) to evaluate the sensitivity of the
VERDICT framework to differences in tumor pathophysiology
by comparing two different human colorectal carcinoma cell
lines (LS174T and SW1222); (iv) to assess the ability of VERDICT to detect response to therapy. Two experiments were
performed. The ﬁrst addressed aims 1, 2, and 3 by ﬁtting
VERDICT, IVIM, and ADC models to DW-MRI signals from
both cell lines. The second experiment addressed aim 4 by
assessing the acute response to a chemotherapeutic agent
(gemcitabine). For this experiment, we aimed to detect small,
acute changes in cell size induced by gemcitabine.

Materials and Methods
Animal models
All experiments were performed in accordance with the
local ethical review panel, the UK Home Ofﬁce Animals Scientiﬁc Procedures Act 1986, and United Kingdom Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research guidelines (16). A total of
5  106 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (LS174T
and SW1222) were injected subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of

www.aacrjournals.org

female nude MF1 NU/NU mice (2–3 months, 20–25 g). Mice
were scanned at 5 weeks following inoculation, when tumors
were 8 to 12 mm in diameter. Subcutaneous xenografts formed
from these cell lines exhibit markedly different phenotypes:
SW1222 tumors form a well-differentiated cellular structure
featuring regular gland-like structures and dense vasculature,
while the LS174T is moderately to poorly differentiated, with
tightly packed cells and low vascular perfusion (17, 18).
The VERDICT model
The mathematical model of the VERDICT framework characterizes water diffusion in vascular, EES, and intracellular
compartments in tumors. These three tissue components are
common to a wide range of different types of tumors, although
their precise nature may vary signiﬁcantly. Mathematically,
VERDICT is the sum of three parametric models, each describing the diffusion magnetic resonance signal in a separate
population of water from one of the three components:
*

*

*

Signal S1 comes from intracellular water trapped inside cells.
Signal S2 comes from EES water adjacent to, but outside cells
and blood vessels.
Signal S3 arises from water in blood undergoing
microcirculation in the capillary network.

The model does not incorporate exchange between the three
water populations. The total magnetic resonance signal for the
multi-compartment VERDICT model is:
3
X
S¼
fi Si
ð1Þ
i¼1

where fi is the proportion of signal with no diffusion weighting (b ¼ 0) from water molecules in population i, 0  fi  1;
X
3
f ¼ 1:
i¼1 i
To model the signal for the intracellular compartment, we
can use any one of multiple models for restricted diffusion in
domains of various shapes (19, 20). Here, we use spheres
because the cells in our tumors are quite isotropic, but
ellipsoids or cylinders are other possibilities. The model for
the EES compartment uses a diffusion tensor model (21).
Here, we constrain it to be isotropic, but if the cells and their
arrangement are anisotropic, this diffusion tensor should
also be anisotropic. The vascular pseudo-diffusion model
also uses a diffusion tensor model. Preliminary experiments
(22) suggest a high degree of anisotropy in this component of
our data, so we used a diffusion tensor that assumes pseudodiffusion in the vascular space is oriented along a single
direction, but more isotropic models may be appropriate in
situations in which the capillaries have less coherent orientation (see Supplementary Data). In total, seven parameters
of the VERDICT model were estimated in this study: f1, f2, f3,
P, R, u, and w, where f1 is the volume fraction of the
intracellular compartment, f2 is the volume fraction of the
EES compartment, f3 is the volume fraction of the vascular
compartment, P is the pseudo-diffusion coefﬁcient, R is the
cell radius parameter, which we refer to as cell radius index,
as it relates to the distribution of actual radii in a nontrivial

anisotropic diffusion tensor.
In vivo MRI
DW-MR images were acquired in vivo, using a 9.4T scanner
(Agilent) with maximum gradient strength 400 mT/m. We used
a pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence (23) with 46
diffusion weightings: diffusion times D ¼ 10, 20, 30, and 40
milliseconds, gradient durations d ¼ 3 milliseconds for all D
and d ¼ 10 milliseconds for D ¼ 30 and 40 milliseconds;
gradient strength |G| varied from 40 to 400 mT/m in 10 steps
of 40 mT/m for d ¼ 3 milliseconds and |G| ¼ 40, 80, and 120
mT/m for d ¼ 10 milliseconds. Separate images were acquired
with diffusion gradients placed along each of the three imaging
coordinate axes. We used minimum echo times (TE) for each d
and D combination to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
and chose repetition times (TR) to minimize gradient heating
effects. For each combination of diffusion weighting parameters, we acquired b ¼ 0 images to correct for T1 and T2
dependence. A separate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquisition was also performed using a 42-direction scheme with b ¼
1,000 s/mm2 and six unweighted (b ¼ 0) measurements.
Imaging parameters for the diffusion-weighted imaging and
DTI acquisitions were: in-plane ﬁeld of view 25 mm  25 mm,
matrix size 64  64, with 5 mm  0.5 mm slices. Total
acquisition time for one animal was 2.5 hours.
Response to gemcitabine
For the therapy study, a shortened version of the imaging
protocol was used with 13 diffusion weightings, as well as the
DTI scan. The protocol was chosen to ﬁt within a scanning time
constraint of 1 hour that we impose to achieve sufﬁcient
temporal resolution for the experiment while allowing investigation for an effect at just 5 hours postdosing. The 13
weightings are a subset of the 46 in the full protocol including
long and short diffusion times and a range of gradient strengths
chosen to cover the range of signal attenuations evenly, and
thus support a good ﬁt of the model to the data. Five mice
bearing LS174T xenografts were scanned before and 5 hours
after intraperitoneal administration of 120 mg/kg of gemcitabine (Gemzar; Eli Lilly and Company) in 0.2 mL saline (24). A
control group (n ¼ 5 LS174T) was administered 0.2 mL saline
and underwent an identical imaging protocol. The speciﬁc
imaging parameters for the response study were: D ¼ 10, 30,
and 40 milliseconds with d ¼ 3 milliseconds for |G| ¼ 120, 280,
and 360 mT/m and D ¼ 30 and 40 milliseconds with and d ¼ 10
milliseconds for |G| ¼ 40 and 120 mT/m. The DTI acquisition
had 15 directions and one b ¼ 0 measurement. Total acquisition time for each animal was 1 hour, although the same
number of measurements typically requires around 15 minutes
on a human system.
Model ﬁtting
VERDICT uses a similar iterative optimization procedure (8)
for model ﬁtting that accounts for local minima and Rician
noise. First, the ﬁtting was performed with data averaged over
all voxels within a tumor region of interest (ROI); subsequently,
the ﬁtting was repeated in each voxel. A set of model para-

1904

meters was constrained in the optimization using transformations to limit the range of each parameter to biophysically
meaningful values. The cell radius index R was constrained so
that 0.1 mm  R  20.1 mm, the pseudo-diffusion coefﬁcient P
was constrained to be larger than free water diffusion [P  3.05
mm2/ms (25)], and the volume fractions of all compartments
were constrained to [0,1] and to sum to 1. To increase the
stability of the ﬁtting, we ﬁx the diffusion coefﬁcient of the
intracellular and EES compartments to a value that provides
the best ﬁt to the data: dR ¼ d k ¼ 9  1010 m2/s. The
implementation will be available in the open source Camino
toolkit at http://cmic.cs.ucl.ac.uk/camino/.
Statistical analysis
This was performed using the R software platform. Results
were presented as box-and-whisker or ladder plots. Significance for discriminating the two cell lines was assessed by
Mann–Whitney U test, and response to therapy by a paired
Mann–Whitney U test. A P < 0.05 was considered to be
signiﬁcant.
Histologic analysis
To validate the estimates we obtain from VERDICT, we used
histologic analysis to acquire independent measurements of
cell size, cell density, and detection of apoptotic cells. For the
assessment of apoptosis in vitro at 24 and 72 hours, we use ﬂow
cytometry. Details of each method are in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.

Results
Experiment 1: characterization of tumor types
The aim of the ﬁrst experiment was to characterize differences between two tumor xenografts SW1222 and LS174T,
using different models (ADC, IVIM, and VERDICT). Figure 1
shows that VERDICT captures the broad trends in the data for
both cell lines by comparing the measured and predicted
normalized diffusion signal S as a function of the imaging
parameters (gradient strength |G|, diffusion time D, pulse
width d, and gradient orientation; Supplementary Fig. S1 shows
the VERDICT ﬁt to all the samples). Conversely, also in Fig. 1,
the ADC and IVIM models exhibit clear departures from the
data for both cell lines (note that both the ADC and IVIM
models are inherently isotropic so the predicted signals for the
x, y, and z gradient directions overlap). These departures
illustrate an inability of ADC and IVIM to model the variation
in the signal; results are similar for all the tumor samples. These
results show that VERDICT explains the DW-MRI data for both
cell lines better than current models (aim 1). Supplementary
Fig. S2 shows an example of DW-MRI data averaged over a ROI
in the tumor and magnetic resonance images for various
diffusion weightings (b values), to illustrate data quality in
both datasets.

experiment explored the accuracy of VERDICT estimates in
comparison with histology, satisfying aim 2.
The comparison between the two cell lines found all VERDICT parameter estimates signiﬁcantly different (Fig. 3), distinguishing the microstructure of the two tumor types (aim
3). Figure 3F–J displays parameter estimates for the ADC and
the IVIM models. None of the parameter estimates from either
the ADC or the IVIM models show signiﬁcant differences
between the two tumor types, which highlights the additional
discriminatory power of the VERDICT model. We also present,
for completeness, the orientation angle estimates for all the
samples in Supplementary Table S1.
Parameter maps
Figure 4 shows microstructural parameter maps for the
volume fractions of each model component, the cell radius
index R and the perfusion coefﬁcient P from a voxel by voxel
ﬁtting of VERDICT. As with the whole ROI analysis, spatial
mapping allows clear differences between the two cell lines to
be discerned, particularly via the intracellular volume fraction,
the radius index, and the pseudo-diffusion coefﬁcient (aim 3).
Also they reveal similar trends to the averaged signal results
in Fig. 3A, for all parameters. This demonstrates the ability of
VERDICT to investigate tumors at a regional basis to reveal
potential heterogeneity.

values from LS174T on an average 1.2 times greater than
from SW1222 tumors (mean volume fraction 0.84  0.02 and
0.68  0.02, respectively). The analysis of equivalent histologic
sections from the tumors found a measured intracellular
volume fraction ratio of 1.0 between the SW1222 and LS174T
tumors (SW/LS). For the EES volumes, the estimates in SW1222
tumors were larger than those in LS174T. VERDICT also
distinguished between the two tumor types based on their
vascular characteristics. Both the vascular volume fraction and
pseudo-diffusion coefﬁcient P were signiﬁcantly greater in
SW1222 tumors than in LS174T tumors. This characteristic
difference between the two cell lines has been previously
described by Folarin and colleagues (18) in a study conducted
at the same laboratory and using the same stock of cells as used
in this study. The absolute values for mean vascular volumes
were 0.12 and 0.22 for LS174T and SW1222 tumors, respectively, consistent with previous measurements of 0.08 and 0.25
(18), again, performed at the same laboratory with the same
samples as the current study, even though the ratio for
VERDICT was 1.8 and the measured vascular volume fraction
ratio of the reference was 3.1. Moreover, our own measurements using arterial spin labeling MRI (26) gave perfusion
estimates that were 1.9 times larger in SW1222 than LS174T
tumors, and this ratio from VERDICT estimates was 1.6. This

Experiment 2: response to gemcitabine
Flow cytometry of LS174T cells treated with 5 mmol/L
gemcitabine for 24 hours showed a >5-fold increase in apoptosis, compared with untreated controls (15.5%  3.2% and
2.4%  2.3%, respectively). This conﬁrms the sensitivity of the
cell line to gemcitabine. In vitro microscopy of LS174T cell
cultures revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in cell size from 5 hours
following exposure to gemcitabine, relative to controls, which
is consistent with the time course of apoptotic volume
decrease (AVD) reported previously (Fig. 5F; ref. 27).
For in vivo VERDICT data analysis, parameter estimation
pre- and post-gemcitabine therapy was performed by ﬁtting
the model to the averaged signal over the whole tumor ROI for
each dataset. No signiﬁcant change in any parameter estimate
was observed in a control group injected with saline solution
(P > 0.05). The ADC and IVIM model estimates showed no
signiﬁcant change in treatment and control groups. At 5 hours
following gemcitabine administration, VERDICT showed a
signiﬁcant increase in vascular volume fraction and a significant decrease in intracellular volume fraction (P < 0.05, Mann–
Whitney paired U test) in Fig. 5A–E, identifying response to
therapy (aim 4). Most samples also showed a small increase in
cell radius (mean 17% in three samples) and in pseudo-diffusion coefﬁcient (mean 11.6% in three samples), but the overall
change was not signiﬁcant.
Histologic assessment showed no signiﬁcant increase in
staining for caspase-3 (a marker of apoptosis) at 5 hours
following gemcitabine administration; however, a signiﬁcant
increase in the percentage caspase-stained cells was measured
at 24 and 72 hours, relative to controls (Fig. 5G; control, 18% 
3%; 24 hours, 35%  5%; 72 hours, 27%  5%; P < 0.05). No
change in cell size was visible on histologic sections at 5 hours.

Discussion
Through its use of the dispersion of endogenous tissue

parameter estimates, the results remain equivocal. VERDICT
provides a more effective probe of microstructure than ADC
and IVIM, signiﬁcantly enhancing DW-MRI tumor studies. We
expect the technique to be broadly applicable in a wide variety
of biologic tissue and adjustable for different types of tumors,
although adjustments to the models for each individual compartment are likely to be necessary for best performance in
different applications.
This study investigated the human colorectal carcinoma cell
lines SW1222 and LS174T whose markedly differing phenotypes provide a useful comparative model system. VERDICT
provided a better ﬁt to in vivo data than both the standard ADC
and IVIM models. The parameter estimates of VERDICT were
broadly consistent with histology and arterial spin labeling
MRI, performed either during the study, or taken from previously published reports in the literature from our own laboratory, using the same stock of cells as used in this study. Our
results also showed that, unlike ADC and IVIM, VERDICT
identiﬁed statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two
tumor types, such as greater blood volume, pseudo-diffusion
coefﬁcient, cell size, EES volume fraction, and lower intracellular volume fraction in SW1222 tumors, compared with
LS174T tumors.

Cancer Res; 74(7) April 1, 2014

Some discrepancies between VERDICT estimates and our
reference values do appear. Minor disagreement was observed
for the intracellular volume fraction, which VERDICT predicted to be larger for LS174T than SW1222, while histology
did not. These differences may arise for various reasons, for
example, due to limitations of the model (discussed later),
imperfect parameter estimates from histology [sectioning
and/or ﬁxation can signiﬁcantly alter the original state of the
tissue and the water it contains (28)], and bias and inaccuracy
in the use of stereologic techniques to infer three-dimensional
structure.
VERDICT was also used to detect changes induced by a
chemotoxic agent. Flow cytometry demonstrated sensitivity
of LS174T cells to gemcitabine, with a signiﬁcant increase in
apoptosis at 24 hours following dosing, which is in agreement
with previous studies (29). At 5 hours following administration
of gemcitabine, VERDICT estimates of intracellular volume
signiﬁcantly decreased by 8.5%. An in vitro experiment also
revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in LS174T cell size from 5 hours
after gemcitabine dosing, while the size of control cells
remained constant. In contrast, no change in cell size could
be detected on histologic sections, although the tissue processing associated with histology could well mask this effect. No

Noninvasive Quantiﬁcation Tumor Tissue with VERDICT MRI

Figure 5. Results of gemcitabine
(GEM) response experiments (in
vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo). A–E,

estimates from the VERDICT
model, pre- and 5 hours after
administration of gemcitabine, in
LS174T tumors. Black lines, 120
mg/kg gemcitabine group; gray
lines, saline-only control group.
A signiﬁcant increase in vascular
volume (A) and decrease in
intracellular volume (C) were
measured ( , P < 0.05, Mann–
Whitney U test). No signiﬁcant
change was measured in any of
the parameter estimates in the
control group. A reduction in cell
size was detected in serial in vitro
measurements of LS174T cell
sizes in culture, using brightﬁeld
microscopy, in which exposure
to gemcitabine (5 mmol/L)
signiﬁcantly decreased cell size
from 5 hours onwards, relative
to controls (F). This effect is
consistent with AVD and occurred
in advance of apoptosis-related
biochemical effects.
Representative images of tumor
sections stained for caspase-3
(brown) and hematoxylin and eosin
(purple and pink) are shown in
G. Caspase did not signiﬁcantly
increase at 5 hours, but was
signiﬁcantly increased at 24 hours.

signiﬁcant increase in immunohistochemical staining of
tumor sections for caspase ("executioner" proteins that are
upregulated during apoptosis) or DNA double strand breaks
was found at 5 hours. However, biochemical effects would not
necessarily be expected at this early time point. Caspase
staining was signiﬁcantly increased at 24 and 72 hours. The
change in cell size at 5 hours following dosing identiﬁed with in
vivo VERDICT and during in vitro experiments, before caspase
upregulation, are consistent with previous descriptions of AVD
(27). This raises the exciting possibility that in vivo detection of
AVD with VERDICT could offer an early response biomarker
that is identiﬁable before histologically measurable effects.
Less anticipated was the signiﬁcant increase in blood volume that was also measured. Vascular effects caused by
chemotherapy have been reported previously, such as in breast
cancer at 2 months (30) and 7 days (31) following therapy. This
acute effect could also potentially be due to antivascular effects
caused by apoptosis of endothelial cells (32, 33). Gemcitabine
has been found to induce a transient pulmonary constriction
within 30 minutes of administration into an isolated lung
perfusion model, which is further suggestive of a direct vas-

www.aacrjournals.org

cular effect (34). Thus, the increase in pseudo-diffusion measured by VERDICT could either be due to a tumor-speciﬁc
effect or due to systemic vascular toxicity.
The key features of the VERDICT model that enable it to ﬁt
the data better than ADC or IVIM are: (i) signal anisotropy,
which simple ADC and IVIM models do not capture, but
VERDICT does (here in the vascular compartment); and (ii)
restricted diffusion, which neither ADC nor IVIM model incorporate, but VERDICT does with the intracellular compartment.
Signal anisotropy is evident in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2
from the separation of the signals with the same b value but
different direction. However, anisotropic versions of the ADC
model [the diffusion tensor model (21)] and the IVIM model (a
two-tensor model), as well as an isotropic version of VERDICT
(with an isotropic vascular compartment), are also inferior to
the VERDICT model (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, both
additional features of the VERDICT model are necessary to
explain the signal in this application.
Wider use and acceptance of the VERDICT technique will
rely on its implementation in the clinic, which places limits
on acquisition times required for good patient compliance.

The acquisition protocol of the ﬁrst DW-MRI experiment
was purposefully designed to establish the best form for the
model, and for supporting feasible and stable microstructure
parameter estimation rather than for use as a working
protocol. The reduced protocol used in the second experiment is representative, in terms of number of measurements, of what might be feasible to acquire clinically. This
protocol returned parameter values comparable with those
found in the ﬁrst experiment, which suggests that prospects
are good for ﬁnding an economical protocol for clinical
acquisitions using, for example, experiment design optimization, as in ref. 35.
An important issue in translation of the VERDICT framework to clinical applications is the limited gradient strength
available on clinical magnetic resonance systems, which typically have 40 to 60 mT/m rather than 400 mT/m in the animal
scanner we used in this study. Cells in many human tumors
have a size similar to the cells in the xenograft models we use
here, that is, around 15 mm. The standard PGSE sequence with
a gradient strength of 60 mT/m is sensitive to pore sizes with
diameters of 5 to 25 mm (35, 36), although smaller pores are still
detectable but can be identiﬁed only as "small" rather than
sized accurately (7, 35). Thus, VERDICT may be best suited to
applications where the cell size ﬁts within the 5 to 25 mm range.
Limited gradient strength means that SNR is lower in data from
clinical systems compared with animal systems. Although
voxels are larger, which mitigates the effect to some extent,
we can expect a reduction of the SNR of 20 in the data
presented here to as low as 10 in clinical applications. We
believe such data can still support estimation of the VERDICT
parameters, as models of similar complexity, such as the
diffusion tensor model, are routinely ﬁtted to data of similar
SNR in human brain imaging applications. Nevertheless, applications will require careful experiment design to maximize the
precision and utility of the recovered parameters. Once applications are established, the stability of the VERDICT parameter
estimates across centers is also likely to be similar to that of the
diffusion tensor model, although we would hope that through
the use of experiment design optimization during the early
translation phases, we can agree on common imaging protocols from the outset to minimize cross-center variation.
New applications are likely to require some adaptation of
the model to suit the microstructure under investigation.
We expect that the set of compartments (vascular, EES, and
restricted) is likely to suit a wide variety of tumors and other
tissue types. However, the precise models for each compartment are likely to require tuning depending on the shape and
arrangement of cellular structures. This can require signiﬁcant
development informed from both histology and pilot MRI
studies following a similar procedure to ref. 8, which identiﬁes
the best model from a set of candidates for white matter tissue,
and which gives some detail of the similar procedure that led to
the choice of model for this study (22). Once a good candidate
model for a clinical application is identiﬁed, widespread adoption will require further steps involving patient-by-patient
validation, for example of parameter estimates against biopsy
histology, which is often available from the clinical diagnostic
routine.

Although more complex than current models for DW-MRI in
tumors, VERDICT is still a major simpliﬁcation of real tissue
microenvironment. For example, it is well known that tumor
vasculature is leaky, leading to signiﬁcant exchange of water
between the vascular and other spin populations; VERDICT
does not currently model this effect. We speciﬁcally designed
the model to have the minimum number of parameters
required to ﬁt the data and found that including any additional
parameters does not signiﬁcantly improve the ﬁt and destabilizes the model, increasing the variance of parameter estimates. The effects of exchange between compartments most
likely manifest as changes in the estimated volume fractions of
the three tissue components. Indeed, we observe that the
SW1222 tumors have higher EES volume fraction than the
LS174T tumors, which could potentially arise from its highly
fenestrated vascular structure. Another assumption of VERDICT is that cells are perfectly spherical and nonspherical cells
tend to cause the radius index to overestimate the actual radius
through similar mechanisms to those discussed in ref. 7.
Because of the inherent modeling limitations, it is important
to remember when interpreting the parameter estimates from
any model-based technique that the model is an approximation. Other effects not accounted for by the model may well
inﬂuence the parameters designed to capture one particular
effect.
Other useful histologic features may be accessible from
other kinds of DW-MRI measurement, warranting development of more intricate models. For example, it may be possible
to estimate permeability or exchange time parameters via
stimulated echo measurements, as in ref. 37, or double
pulsed-ﬁeld gradient (dPFG) measurements, as in ref. 38. With
varying echo and repetition times, we may be able to estimate
compartmental relaxation (39). It may be possible to estimate
pore-size distributions, as in refs. 6 and 8 with sufﬁcient SNR,
for example, by spatial smoothing of the diffusion-weighted
imaging data or enforcing spatial continuity of parameter
estimates. Pore shapes are potentially accessible through dPFG
(40). Oscillating gradient DW-MRI provides measurements for
shorter diffusion times, potentially improving sensitivity to
smaller structures (41–43).

Conclusion
This study proposes the VERDICT acquisition and mathematical model to noninvasively estimate microstructural parameters in tumors, which we evaluated in two distinct human
colorectal carcinoma xenografts. We found that the estimated
parameters accurately reﬂected known differences in the
microstructure and pathophysiology of the two tumor types,
such as cell size, pseudo-diffusion, and cell and vascular
volume fractions. This approach could potentially provide
new, powerful biomarkers of tumor grade and progression,
which could lead to the establishment of techniques for
noninvasive treatment stratiﬁcation. A key advantage of this
technique is its ability to characterize whole-tumor microstructure, in contrast to traditional histology that samples only
a very small region. Finally, the model detected microstructural
changes, in particular a cell volume decrease, acutely after
