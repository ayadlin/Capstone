Molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or placental growth factor—
critical regulators of tumour angiogenesis—are also thought to mobilize into blood
circulation bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs)1, which may subsequently be recruited to
tumours and facilitate tumour growth and metastasis2,3. A study4 has suggested that BMDCs
form ‘metastatic niches’ in lungs before arrival of cancer cells, and showed that
pharmacological inhibition of VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1, also known as Flt1)—cognate
receptor for VEGF and placental growth factor—prevented BMDC infiltration in lungs and
‘metastatic niche’ formation. Here we report that blockade of VEGFR1 activity does not
affect the rate of spontaneous metastasis formation in a clinically relevant and widely used
preclinical model5–8. Therefore, alternative pathways probably mediate the priming of
tissues for metastasis.

We assessed the role of VEGFR1 activity in spontaneous formation of macroscopic
metastasis after pharmacological inhibition of VEGFR1 (with MF1-blocking antibody). We
generated chimaeric C57BL mice in which BMDCs express green fluorescent protein (GFP)
after lethal irradiation and restorative bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with cells from
Actb-GFP/C57BL mice (BMT-Actb-GFP/C57BL mice). After bone marrow reconstitution,
we subcutaneously implanted Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1/LL2, a BMDC-rich tumour) or
B16 melanoma (a tumour with significantly fewer BMDCs). Continuous treatment with
MF1 did not delay primary tumour growth compared to non-specific IgG. Moreover, MF1
treatment did not reduce BMDC infiltration in LLC1 or B16 tumours (Fig. 1). We resected
these tumours when they had grown to 1 cm in diameter (after 15–17 days) and metastatic
foci had already formed in the lungs5,6. As no macroscopic metastases were detectable at the
time of primary tumour removal, we measured the number of BMDCs in the lungs of BMTActb-GFP/C57BL mice before and after the formation of macroscopic metastases. BMDC
infiltration at the time of resection (day 0) and at day 10 was relatively small but readily
detectable and comparable with overall BMDC accumulation in tumour-free BMT-ActbGFP/C57BL mice in both tumour models (Fig. 1).
This suggests a key role for activated pulmonary alveolar macrophages—BMDCs that reside
in the normal lung in comparable numbers in tumour-free non-BMT C57BL mice—as
opposed to de novo BMDC recruitment before spontaneous metastasis. When most mice
spontaneously developed macroscopic metastases (day 14), we detected a significant
increase in de novo BMDC accumulation inside the LLC1 metastatic nodules and in the
peri-tumour lung tissue, but not in B16 metastases, akin to BMDC incorporation in the
primary tumours in these models (Fig. 1). VEGFR1 blockade with MF1 significantly
reduced BMDC accumulation in LLC1 metastases. Surprisingly, VEGFR1 blockade did not

decrease the occurrence, number, size or overall burden of spontaneous lung metastases on
day 14 after LLC1 or B16 resection compared to control-treated mice (Table 1).

Previous studies in mice genetically deficient in VEGFR1-tyrosine kinase domain (flt1TK−/−
mice) have shown that MMP-9 is induced by VEGFR1 signalling in lung stromal cells,
which facilitates metastatic tumour growth in experimental metastasis models (that is, after
intravenous infusion of cancer cells)9. When tested in flt1TK−/−/C57BL mice, LLC1 growth
was similar and B16 growth was slightly delayed compared to C57BL mice. However, when
evaluated at day 14, the number of mice with spontaneous macroscopic lung metastases or
the number of metastatic nodules was not significantly different (Table 1). CD11b (Mac1)
immunostaining in normal and metastatic lungs of these mice showed comparable myeloid
BMDC infiltration in flt1TK−/−/C57BL and C57BL mice. Finally, since the extracellular
domain of VEGFR1 is present on cells in flt1TK−/−/C57BL mice, we measured by flow
cytometry the number of VEGFR1+ cells in circulating blood and in the tumour tissue. We
detected no significant difference in circulating VEGFR1+ cells in LLC1- or B16-burdened
mice, or in tissue-resident VEGFR1+ cells in normal lung or LLC1 tumours, and only
marginal differences in B16 tumours10.

In conclusion, VEGFR1 modulates BMDC infiltration and primary/metastatic tumour
growth in some models, consistent with previous reports11. However, pharmacological
blockade or genetic deficiency in intracellular VEGFR1-TK domain neither eradicated nor
significantly altered pre-metastatic BMDC infiltration or early spontaneous metastasis
formation in lungs in these models.

METHODS
Flt1TK−/−/C57BL (re-derived from flt1TK−/− mice10,12, kindly provided by M. Shibuya,
Univ. Tokyo) and Actb-GFP/C57BL mice (Jackson Labs), C57BL mouse-syngeneic LLC1
lung carcinoma (CRL-1642) and B16 melanoma cell lines (CRL-6323)(both ATCC), the
BMT and spontaneous metastasis formation models, and confocal microscopy and flow
cytometric analyses have been previously described5,10,12. We used Matlab software for
quantification. Rat anti-VEGFR1 monoclonal antibody (MF1, a gift from ImClone Systems)
or IgG (Jackson Labs) was administered intraperitoneally (20 or 40 mg kg−1) to tumourbearing mice three times per week13. We used Alexa-Fluor-647 (Molecular Probes)-labelled
MF1 for flow cytometry. All other antibodies were purchased from BD-Pharmingen.
