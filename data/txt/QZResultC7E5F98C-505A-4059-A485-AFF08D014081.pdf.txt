Abstract
Tumor growth is not solely a consequence of autonomous tumor cell properties.
Rather, tumor cells act upon and are acted upon by their microenvironment. It is
tumor tissue biology that ultimately determines tumor growth. Thus, we developed a
compound library screen for agents that could block essential tumor-promoting effects
of the glioblastoma (GBM) perivascular stem cell niche (PVN). We modeled the PVN
with three-dimensional primary cultures of human brain microvascular endothelial
cells in Matrigel. We previously demonstrated stimulated growth of GBM cells in
this PVN model and used this to assay PVN function. We screened the Microsource
Spectrum Collection library for drugs that specifically blocked PVN function, without
any direct effect on GBM cells themselves. Three candidate PVN-disrupting agents,
Iridin, Tigogenin and Triacetylresveratrol (TAR), were identified and evaluated in
secondary in vitro screens against a panel of primary GBM isolates as well as in two
different in vivo intracranial models. Iridin and TAR significantly inhibited intracranial
tumor growth and prolonged survival in these mouse models. Together these data
identify Iridin and TAR as drugs with novel GBM tissue disrupting effects and validate
the importance of preclinical screens designed to address tumor tissue function rather
than the mechanisms of autonomous tumor cell growth.

Introduction

as cancer “stem-like” cells (CSCs). CSCs are thought to
drive tumor growth and recurrence [1-5], and therefore
CSC-directed therapy may provide a long-awaited critical
advance in GBM care. CSCs are localized to a specialized
domain that surrounds the tumor microvasculature, often
referred to as the peri-vascular niche (PVN). The PVN is
a complex structure composed of tumor cells, microglia,

Despite decades of clinical and basic research, a
diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM) continues to carry a
dismal prognosis, and new approaches to cure are needed.
Recent studies have identified a sub-population of tumor
cells with enhanced tumor-initiating capability, known

astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells [6, 7]. Each
component cell type may play a role in the maintenance
of the CSC phenotype, thereby promoting tumor growth
and therapeutic resistance [8-11]. Therefore, successful
ablation of CSCs may be possible by targeting their
interactions with these non-tumor cell components of the
PVN.
To better define the mechanisms by which
endothelial cells drive GBM growth, and to provide
a system for high throughput screening for drugs that
can disrupt the functions of the PVN, we developed
a co-culture system in which we could measure the
tumor-promoting effects of endothelial cells on GBM
cells [8]. In this model, primary cultures of human
brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and
either an established human GBM cell line (U87) or
primary GBM cell isolates were cultured together in a
laminin-rich extracellular matrix (Matrigel). In Matrigel,
HBMECs adopted a phenotype and spatial distribution
reminiscent of endothelial cells in vivo. Addition of either
primary GBM or U87 cells to the HBMECs resulted in
migration of tumor cells to the PVN where they exhibited
enhanced growth. A trophic effect of the PVN was
mediated by endothelial cell-derived CXCL12 [8] and
was blocked by treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist
AMD3100, depletion of CXCL12 in endothelial cells or
overexpression of G-protein coupled receptor kinase 3, a
negative regulator of the CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4, in
tumor cells [12]. These studies support the functionality
of this model and its application in efforts to both identify
pathways that mediate endothelial and GBM cell crosstalk, and compounds that can target PVN function. We
hypothesized that screens incorporating elements of this

critical cell-cell interaction would have a higher likelihood
of identifying agents with significant in vivo activity.
A cell based high-throughput drug screen offers
the potential to identify novel compounds that can be
quickly moved to pre-clinical evaluation. Furthermore,
examination of the targets of these lead compounds
may reveal previously unappreciated biologic pathways
contributing to GBM growth. We used our co-culture
system to screen the Spectrum Collection compound
library (Microsource Discovery Systems). This library
contains a bio-diverse group of 2000 compounds including
FDA approved drugs, compounds that are currently in
clinical trials, experimental agents and natural extracts.
Recent high-throughput screens of this library have
identified potential novel anti-glioma therapeutics [13,
14]. However, our screen is distinct from these prior
studies as it measures anti-tumor cell effects in the setting
of tumor-endothelial cell co-culture. Since endothelial
cells can induce a treatment resistant and pro-growth state
in tumor cells [15], we hypothesized that drugs that affect
tumor cell growth in this more “native” microenvironment
would have a greater chance of blocking tumor growth
in vivo. Specifically, our current study was designed to
identify drugs that inhibit glioma growth by disrupting the
interaction between glioma and endothelial cells within
the PVN rather than acting on tumor cells alone.

Results
Our previous studies demonstrated that an
established GBM cell line, as well as tumor cells derived
from primary pediatric GBM, showed enhanced growth
when co-cultured with HBMECs in a laminin-rich

extracellular matrix [8]. This suggested that incorporation
of these tumor microenvironmental elements would
support a significantly more clinically relevant assessment
of novel candidate anti-GBM agents. We used our coculture system to perform a high throughput compound
library screen to identify novel compounds that could
specifically block the trophic effects of endothelial cells on
GBM cells. We designed the screen to rule out compounds
that are simply cytotoxic to GBM cells and to identify
those that are both non-toxic to tumor cells directly and
potent antagonists of the trophic effect of the endothelia
on tumor cell proliferation.

anti-tumor activity, and these results highlight a pitfall of
monoculture drug screening. The final class of drugs was
a small but diverse group of compounds that had no effect
on U87 monocultures but significantly blocked the trophic
effects of HBMECs on U87 cells. Compounds with an
anti-trophic effect of greater than three times the standard
deviation of the mean library effect and without any direct
cytotoxic effect were prioritized for additional evaluation
(Table 1). Ten compounds met these criteria. Among them
were two anthracycline anti-neoplastic agents, aklavine
and mitoxanthrone. Interestingly, mitoxanthrone has
recently been demonstrated to have efficacy in recurrent
GBM [18, 19]. Also included were Dihydrodeoxygedunin,
a member of a compound family with known neural
differentiating activity [20] and both resveratrol and its
derivative, Triacetylresveratrol. Resveratrol has garnered
much attention as a potential anti-aging and anti-neoplastic
agent [21-23].

Primary screens
The initial screens were performed using a
glioblastoma cell line (U87) stably expressing a GFPLuciferase construct in which U87 cell number has been
demonstrated to be linearly related to bioluminescence
(BLI) [16, 17]. Similar to our previous reports [8, 12],
when cultured with HBMECs, U87 cells exhibited a ~2
fold increase in tumor cell number as measured by BLI.
When delivered at the compound library standard dose
of 5μM, drug effects on HBMEC-stimulated U87 growth
fell into four categories. The majority of compounds
had no effect on U87 cells alone and did not block the
trophic effect of endothelial cells on U87 cells (Figure
1, Supplemental Figure 1). A second small group of
compounds were generally cytotoxic to U87 cells alone
and in co-culture. These were ruled out for further
evaluation, as their anti-tumor effect was not specific to
disrupting PVN function. A third interesting group was
cytotoxic to U87 cells in monoculture, but not when U87
cells were co-cultured. Based on the protective effects
of the endothelial cells, this group of drugs, listed in
Supplemental Table 1, would not likely exhibit in vivo
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Secondary screens
Only four compounds, Tigogenin, Iridin,
Triacetylresveratrol (TAR) and Andirobin completely
blocked the trophic effects of endothelial cells without any
direct cytotoxic effects on the U87 cells. Therefore, these
compounds were evaluated in secondary screens in which
we sought first to first identify in vitro activity against a
panel of primary adult and pediatric GBM specimens.
These secondary screens were designed to directly test
the dose responses to each compound in cell systems with
greater fidelity to native GBM cell biology and with which
we could capture the heterogeneity of GBM as it occurs
in children and adults. We first determined whether the
compounds might have toxicity against normal human
astrocytes as this could limit their development as clinical
agents. We treated primary human astrocyte cultures with

each tested against a panel of primary GBM cultures (CDI-2, B18, G144, CDI-3). In each case, drug efficacy was measured

by its ability to block the trophic effect of HBMEC conditioned media (CM). The basal trophic effect was measured as the fold-increase
in cell number induced by CM (compare white to black bars). Cell number measured in CM cultures treated with a range of drug doses as
indicated were normalized to cell number in equivalent drug treated TSM cultures. Shown are the means and SEM of three independent

each drug (5 μM) and found that similar to their effects on
U87 cells these compounds were non-toxic in monoculture
(Supplemental Figure 2). As primary GBM cells did not
contain luciferase, we could neither measure GBM cell
number using BLI nor readily distinguish changes in
GBM and endothelial cell number in physical co-culture.
We therefore developed an alternate approach for assays
of endothelial cell effect on primary GBM cell number
involving primary GBM cell culture in media conditioned
by HBMECs. In pilot studies, primary pediatric GBM
cells (CDI-2, 3 and 4) were cultured in either standard
tumorsphere media (TSM) or tumorsphere media
conditioned by HBMECs for 96 hours. Cell numbers
were measured using a cell proliferation kit (Promega).
HBMEC conditioned media (CM) induced tumor cell
growth to a similar extent (~2-5 fold) as physical cocultures with U87 cells and primary GBM cells as we
previously reported (Supplemental Figure 3A) [8]. To
determine whether there was any specificity in this growth
effect for neoplastic cells, we measured growth of normal
human astrocytes and found that HBMEC conditioned
media had only a small effect on their growth (1.2 fold)
suggesting some specificity of the HBMEC effect on GBM
cells (Supplemental Figure 3B). These data indicated that
factors secreted by HBMECs more potently stimulate
GBM compared to astrocyte cell growth. Therefore, we
performed initial secondary screens by treating tumor cells
grown in CM in the presence or absence of the anti-trophic
compounds. As a negative control we used melatonin, a
compound that was completely inactive in the primary
screen.
Similar to their activity in the primary screen,
none of the drugs had any direct effect on the tumor cells

themselves but exhibited significant potency in blocking
the trophic effect of the CM. The anti-trophic effects
of the drugs were cell-type specific. Tigogenin, Iridin
and TAR successfully blocked the trophic effect of CM
on CDI-2 cells and had a partial effect on CDI-4 cells,
but were completely ineffective with the CDI-3 cells
(Supplemental Figure 3A). Andirobin was ineffective
at blocking the trophic effects of CM on any of these
primary GBM specimens (data not shown). These results
suggest that Andirobin may block a contact-mediated,
rather than a secreted factor-mediated, effect of ECs on
GBM cell growth. We recently reported induction of
phosphodiesterase 7B in GBM tumor cells through direct
contact-mediated effects of endothelial cells in this same
co-culture model [24]. Andirobin was not further evaluated
in these studies. Together, these results emphasize the
importance of multiple cell line testing to address the
highly heterogeneous nature of GBM. In line with our
observations from the initial screens, melatonin had no
effect on primary GBM cells in the secondary screen.
To determine the optimal doses for the antitrophic effect of these compounds, we performed dose
response studies for Tigogenin, Iridin and TAR on the
pediatric GBM cell lines CDI-2 and CDI-3, as well as
two additional primary adult GBM derived stem cell
lines, G144 and B18 (Figure 2). We tested the anti-trophic
activity of these drugs at doses ranging from 0.05μM to
500 μM. Tigogenin and Iridin displayed reproducible
dose responses in the CDI-2, G144 and B18 cells with
maximal inhibition at 500 μM. Triacetylresveratrol had
a similar dose response in the CDI-2 cells but exerted a
general inhibition at most concentrations in G144 and B18
cells. Consistent with the pilot studies, none of the drugs

showed any anti-trophic effect on CDI-3 cell proliferation.
In primary human astrocytes, only Triacetylresveratrol
demonstrated inhibition of the modest tropic effect of
CM (Supplemental Figure 3C). These data confirmed
the potential importance of these three compounds as
candidate anti-GBM agents and also indicated that they
exert their effects directly on tumor cells, but only when
these tumor cells are sensitized through the actions of
endothelial cell-derived secreted factors.

each week. Compared to vehicle treated controls, Iridin
treatment resulted in a statistically significant prolongation
of median survival from 15 to 22 days (p = 0.0027, logrank test) (Figure 3A). TAR treatment trended towards
a similar survival benefit with a shift in median survival
from 15 to 19 days (p = 0.07, log-rank test) compared to
control. In this model, Tigogenin was without effect.
To further evaluate the potential therapeutic value
of Iridin and TAR, we treated mice bearing intracranial
xenografts of the primary G144 GBM isolate engineered
to express firefly luciferase. After establishing engraftment
and steady tumor growth (14 weeks post implantation),
mice were randomized to three treatment groups: 1)
vehicle, 2) Iridin and 3) TAR. Treatment was the same
as for the U87 experiment, and intracranial growth was
followed with bi-weekly bioluminescence imaging. Both
Iridin and TAR rapidly and significantly blocked further
intracranial growth (Figure 3B).

Effect of compounds on HBMECs
In the primary physical co-culture screens, both
tumor cells and endothelial cells were exposed to the
anti-trophic compounds, but only the proliferation of
tumor cells was assessed. To directly assess the effect
of compounds on HBMECs, HBMECs were cultured
with drugs at concentrations of 0.05-50 µM for 4 days
(Supplemental Figure 4). Iridin and Tigogenin increased
HBMEC proliferation by 30-40% at concentrations at
or above 5 µM for Iridin and 50 µM for Tigogenin. In
the primary screen (drug concentrations of 5 uM), Iridin
and Tigogenin diminished the trophic effect of HBMECs
on GBM cells, despite the possible increase in HBMEC
cell number. At the dose used in primary screens (5 uM),
HBMEC cell number was diminished by TAR by 35%.
Therefore, the direct toxicity of TAR on HBMECs may
account for some of the anti-trophic effect of that drug
in the co-culture model of the primary screen. However,
in the secondary screens, the experimental paradigm does
not subject HBMECs to anti-trophic compounds, as the
compounds are added to media conditioned by untreated
HBMECs. Therefore, while the direct toxicity of TAR
on HBMECs may account for some of its anti-trophic
effect on tumor cell growth in the primary screen, the
secondary screen demonstrates that TAR is also effective
in diminishing the HBMEC trophic effect caused by direct
action on tumor cells.

Discussion
Despite decades of research, median survival for
GBM remains relatively unchanged. Novel therapeutics
and approaches are needed. While reports of new drugs
with promising activity are frequent, few gains have
been observed in the clinic. Among the reasons for the
disappointing performance of standard preclinical studies
may be the common format for drug screening in which
novel compounds are tested against panels of tumor cell
monocultures to identify agents that can block tumor cell
autonomous mechanisms of growth. GBM, like other solid
cancers, are highly complex tissues in which cell-cell
interactions drive tumor growth and promote resistance
[6]. Thus, we reasoned that a screen for compounds that
blocked these cell-cell interactions would enhance the
specificity for drugs that could function in vivo, within
the context of tumor tissue, and thereby improve the
translational potential of any results.
To prove the utility of this approach, we
purposefully focused on agents that had no direct
cytotoxic effect and whose in vitro activity was confined
to blockade of endothelial cell stimulated growth. We
screened the Spectrum Collection because among the 2000
compounds in this library are many naturally occurring
and FDA approved drugs and therefore there is potential
for rapid translation. Several of the compounds were
generally toxic and killed tumor cells grown alone or as
co-cultures, some were toxic in monocultures but had no
effect in the presence of endothelial cells, and only a few
were capable of specifically blocking the trophic effect ( >
3 SD of the mean) of endothelial cells on the GBM cells.
These observations, particularly those instances where
drugs were cytotoxic in tumor cell monocultures but not in
the co-cultures, highlight the importance of the co-culture
and HBMEC-conditioned media models for this screen.
Treating tumor cells alone would have identified drugs

Pre-clinical evaluation of lead compounds
The ultimate goal of these studies is the identification
of PVN-disrupting drugs for clinical evaluation. Thus,
the anti-tumor effects of Tigogenin, Iridin and TAR were
further evaluated using intracranial xenograft models of
GBM as previously described by us and others [8, 25]. An
initial in vivo screen was performed with U87 cells. As is
standard in our model, 50,000 firefly luciferase-expressing
tumor cells were stereotactically implanted into the cortex
of nude mice. Engraftment and initial growth were verified
by weekly bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and those
mice with tumors exhibiting equivalent rates of growth
were randomized into four treatment groups: 1) vehicle
control, 2) Tigogenin, 3) Iridin and 4) TAR. Each drug
was delivered by oral gavage at 20 mg/kg daily for 5 days

with less translational potential.
Iridin, Tigogenin and TAR are all non-cytotoxic
compounds derived from naturally occurring plant
sources. Iridin is a glucoside found in both the rhizomes
of the iris plant such as Iris versicolor, and the roots of
violets. It is more commonly known as Blue Flag and
has historically been used for “removing bile” and as a
laxative. Multiple compounds derived from the Iridaceae
family have been evaluated for their anti-tumor and
anti-inflammatory effects [26]. Liu et al. showed that
several have an anti-tumor effects on various cancer
cell lines including stomach cancer, breast cancer, and
prostate cancer [27]. Interestingly, Iridin did not exhibit a
substantial anti-tumor effect in these monoculture assays,
again underscoring the importance of drug screening in a
co-culture system. It was only in this setting that Iridin’s
anti-tumor effect was revealed.
TAR is a derivative of Resveratrol with improved
bioavailability [28]. Resveratrol has gained media
attention for its potential anti-aging and anti-cancer effect.
It was first discovered in 1937 in the roots of Japanese
Knotweed, but it can also be derived from grape skins
leading some to investigate its role in the health benefits
seen from drinking red wine [29, 30]. Although antiaging effects have not been consistently reproducible,
it has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and blood
sugar lowering effects [29, 30]. It has been evaluated
in clinical trials for type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s
disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, inflammation,
concussions, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Several
studies have also indicated that Resveratrol may inhibit
events associated with tumor formation and progression
[31, 32]. Mgbonyebi et al. reported that Resveratrol
inhibited the proliferation of human breast epithelial
cells in a dose-dependent manner. Jang et al. showed
that Resveratrol had anti-initiation, anti-promotion and
anti-progression activity against human promyleocytic
leukemia cells. Piceatonnol, a natural metabolite of
Resveratrol, has also been shown to enhance cisplatininduced apotosis, making it an attractive modulator for
treatment of many cancers, especially ovarian cancer,
which is often resistant to cisplatin [33]. Interestingly,
Resveratrol has also been shown to decrease cell growth
through inhibition of Notch 1 signaling [34], a pathway
that has been shown to be important in growth of GBM
and proliferation of GBM stem-like cells within the PVN
[35]. These studies have led to clinical trial investigations
in several malignancies such as gastrointestinal tumors,
colon cancer, and multiple myeloma [36]. Resveratrol is
readily available, making it an attractive therapeutic for a
clinical trial in patients with GBM.
These studies suggest that the mechanisms of
tumor cell expansion within tumor tissue can be distinct
from the mechanisms that drive tumor cell expansion
in monoculture. Thus, TAR and Iridin blocked U87 and
primary GBM isolate growth in co-culture and in vivo but
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

were without effect in monoculture. Rigorous elucidation
of their mechanisms of action will be key to the continued
development of these agents. This will include both the
definition of their cellular targets and their intracellular
target pathways. We tested the effect of each compound
on both normal human astrocytes and HBMECs and
found that only TAR exhibited any cytotoxicity and this
effect was limited to HBMECs. In addition TAR was able
to block the modest trophic effect of CM on astrocytes.
Together these data suggest that the drugs are working
primarily on GBM cells. Further elucidation of their target
pathways is likely to advance our understanding of PVN
biology and identify new therapeutic targets.
Finally, these results suggest that contextualized
GBM cell growth carries specific vulnerabilities for
tumor cells. It may be necessary to screen in this “tumor
tissue” context to fully capitalize on the vast numbers
of synthesized and available compounds before we can
achieve significant improvements in the treatment of GBM
and other intractable cancers. The data reported in this
study directly supports this conclusion. Moreover, our data
indicate that both Iridin and TAR are viable candidates for
novel clinical trials designed to disrupt the function of the
PVN. Particularly important may be the combination of
PVN disruption with cytotoxic or targeted therapeutics.

cultured in tumor sphere media (TSM), which contains
Neurobasal-A media (Gibco) supplemented with
Glutamax (Gibco), 20 ng/mL epithelial growth factor
(EGF, Sigma), 20 ng/mL basic fibroblastic growth factor
(bFGF, Chemicon), 20 ng/mL leukemia inhibitory factor
(LIF, Chemicon), 1 x N2 Supplement (Gibco), 1 x B-27
Serum-Free Supplement (Gibco), and heparin (20 ug/mL,
Sigma). Cells were initially plated on tissue-culture coated
plates overnight to allow non-stem-like cells to attach,
and the non-adherent stem-like cells were transferred to
extracellular matrix protein (ECM)-coated tissue culture
plates prepared by coating with 10% ECM (Sigma) in
Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) and washed
three times in HBSS. Thereafter, GBM stem cells were
maintained in adherent culture on ECM-coated plates in
TSM media, which was changed every 2 to 3 days.

Human brain microvascular endothelial cells were
plated (3000 cells/well) within an extracellular matrix
(Matrigel, BD Dickinson) in 96-well plates compatible
with bioluminescent measurement. After 24 hours (to
allow for endothelial cell tubule formation), U87 cells
(3000 cells/well) were added to the assay plates in
minimal essential media as previously described [8].
Compounds from the Spectrum Collection (Microsource
Discovery Inc.) were added to the co-cultures as well as to
monocultures of tumor cells. DMSO vehicle treated wells
at the same concentration as the diluted solvent in the
library wells served as controls for each plate tested. The
library consisted of FDA approved drugs (50%), natural
products (30%) other non-drug bio-active compounds
(20%). The compounds were supplied as 10mM solutions
in DMSO and were used at a final concentration of 5µM
for the assay. Each compound was tested in triplicate.
Hence for each compound plate, we had six experimental
(three tumor monoculture and three co-culture) plates.
The High Throughput Screening Core at the Washington
University School of Medicine was used for the screen.
Cell numbers were assessed by BLI after 2 days in coculture. The numbers of metabolically active tumor
cells were determined by measuring luminescence upon
addition of the substrate luciferin to the 96 well plates.
The trophic effect was determined as the ratio of the mean
of the bioluminescence reading from the co-cultures to
that of the monocultures for vehicle treated wells. The
% inhibition of trophic effect by each compound was
calculated as follows: %inhibition = [BLI (vehicle treated
co-culture) - BLI (drug-treated co-culture)]/ BLI (vehicle
treated co-culture) - BLI (monoculture)] X 100.

B18 and G144 cells
Primary GBM cell lines were created from freshly
isolated tumor resection tissue as previously described
[37]. Briefly, primary GBM tumor tissue was cleaned
manually of RBCs, mechanically dissociated with forceps
and scalpel, and chemically dissociated with Accutase
(Sigma). Cells were then spun down and triturated gently.
Cells were then plated on PLO (Sigma) and Laminin
(Sigma) coated Primaria plates (BD Biosciences). Cells
were used for experiments after the fifth passage. Media is
RHB-A with EGF (10ng/mL) and FGF (10ng/mL).
Primary human endothelial cells
Primary human brain microvascular endothelial
cells (HBMEC) were obtained from ScienCell, Carlsbad,
CA. HBMECs were used between passages 3-8 and
maintained in endothelial cell growth media (EGM-2MV
(Lonza, Basel, Switzerland)) on gelatin-coated dishes.
Primary human astrocytes
Primary normal human astrocytes (NHAs) were
obtained from Lonza. NHAs were used between passages
3-8 and maintained in astrocyte growth media (EGM
BulletKit (Lonza)) on Primaria plates.

daily by incubating an equivalent number of HBMECs
with TSM overnight. After harvest of conditioned media,
Iridin, Tigogenin, or TAR were added at concentrations
from 0.05 µM to 500 µM. Media was changed daily for
4 days. After 4 days, cell proliferation was determined
by the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Cell proliferation Assay
System following the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega,
Madison, WI). Absorbance at 490 nm was measured using
the µQuant microplate Reader (Bio-Tek instruments,
Winooski, VT). Absorbances from culture medium

U87 cells were originally obtained from ATCC and
were engineered at low passage ( < 5) to express a fusion
protein of firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent
protein (eGFP) driven by the human ubiquitin C promoter
after transduction with a lentivirus (FUW-FLG) as
described previously [38-40]. U87 cells expressing firefly
luciferase-eGFP (U87-Luc) were sorted to purity based
on GFP expression, expanded and stored at -150 degrees
Celsius. All experiments were performed with U87-Luc
cells at less than passage 15 approximately 4 months post
acquisition from ATCC. U87 cells were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Generation of intracranial xenografts

Statistical analysis

Intracranial xenografts were generated as previously
described [16, 17, 40]. Tumor cell lines were harvested
in mid-logarithmic growth phase and resuspended in
PBS. Homozygous NCR female nude mice (Taconic
Farms, Germantown, NY) were anesthetized with
ketamine hydrochloride at 150 mg/kg and xylazine at 12
mg/kg (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, St Joseph, MO) via
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. The cranium was exposed,
and a small hole was made with a size 34 inverted cone
burr (Roboz, Githersburg, MD). Mice were fixed in a
stereotactic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dal, IL), and cells
were injected through a 27-gauge needle over 2 minutes at
2mm lateral and posterior to the bregma and 3mm below
the dura (50,000 U87 cells in 7.5uL of PBS or 94,200
G144 primary cells in 6 uL of media). The incision was
closed with Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN).

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version
4.00 (GraphPad Software). Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were analyzed using pairwise log-rank tests. Given
the repeated measurement of mice over time, statistical
differences in growth curves were analyzed using the
generalized estimating equation regression analysis.

Bioluminescence imaging
Bioluminescence
imaging
of
intracranial
xenografts was performed as previously described [16,
40]. NCR nude mice bearing intracranial xenografts of
U87-luc cells were injected with 150 ug/g D-luciferin
(Biosynth) in PBS, anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurance
and imaged with a charge-coupled device camera-based
bioluminescence imaging system (IVIS 50; Perin-Elmer,
Waltham, MA; exposure time = 1-60 s, binning = 8,
field of view = 12, f/stop = 1, open filter). Signals were
displayed as photons/s/cm2/sr. Regions of interest were
defined manually at 95% of the maximum pixel output
using Living Image an IgorPro Software (v 2.50) and
data were expressed as total photon flux (photons per
second). Generally, the first mouse images were obtained
3-5 days following intracranial inoculation of the tumor
cells then weekly. Data were analyzed and plotted as the
ratio of bioluminescence on a given treatment day over
bioluminescence on the first day.

Mice bearing U87 intracranial xenografts were
imaged twice after implantation to identify those with
equivalent tumor growth rates. Two weeks after tumor
cell implantation, cohorts of mice with approximately
equivalent tumor bioluminescence were divided into
equal control and treatment groups (5-6 mice per group).
Mice bearing primary G144 xenografts were imaged
