ABSTRACT
Cardiac glycosides are well known in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases;
however, their application as treatment option for cancer patients is under discussion.
We showed that the cardiac glycoside digitoxin and its analog AMANTADIG can inhibit
the growth of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines and increase G2/M cell cycle arrest. To
identify the signaling pathways and molecular basis of this G2/M arrest, microRNAs were
profiled using microRNA arrays. Cardiac glycoside treatment significantly deregulated
two microRNAs, miR-2278 and miR-670-5p. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that
all cardiac glycoside treatments affected the MAPK and the axon guidance pathway.
Within these pathways, three genes, MAPK1, NRAS and RAC2, were identified as in silico
targets of the deregulated miRNAs. MAPK1 and NRAS are known regulators of G2/M cell
cycle arrest. AMANTADIG treatment enhanced the expression of phosphorylated MAPK1
in 786-O cells. Secondly, we studied the expression of survivin known to be affected
by cardiac glycosides and to regulate the G2/M cell phase. AMANTADIG treatment
upregulated the expression of the pro-apoptotic survivin-2B variant in Caki-1 and
786-O cells. Moreover, treatment with AMANTADIG resulted in significantly lower survivin
protein expression compared to 786-O control cells. Summarizing, treatment with all
cardiac glycosides induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and downregulated the miR-2278 and
miR-670-5p in microarray analysis. All cardiac glycosides affected the MAPK-pathway
and survivin expression, both associated with the G2/M phase. Because cells in the G2/M
phase are radio- and chemotherapy sensitive, cardiac glycosides like AMANTADIG could
potentially improve the efficacy of radio- and/or chemotherapy in RCCs.

additional therapies.
Cardiac glycosides have garnered attention as a
potential cancer treatment option [4, 5]. They exhibit antiproliferative and apoptotic characteristics in several cancer
cell lines, including renal cell carcinoma cell lines, but
they affect normal cell lines to a much lesser extent [6–10].
We recently showed that a new semisynthetic cardiac
glycoside analog, 3β-[2-(1-amantadine)-1-on-ethylamine]digitoxigenin (AMANTADIG), inhibits the growth of
leukemia, prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma cell
lines [11]. Although several reports have indicated that
cardiac glycosides may function by affecting Na+/K+ATPase, especially its α subunits [4, 5], the molecular
basis of their function remains incompletely understood.
In this study, we investigated the functional effects
of AMANTADIG on the cell cycle and its molecular
effect on gene regulation based on microRNA (miRNA)
deregulation. MiRNAs are small, ubiquitous noncoding RNAs that are 17–25 nucleotides in length and
play an important regulatory role in many normal and
pathophysiological cellular processes, such as cell
proliferation, differentiation, the induction of apoptosis,
tumorigenesis and tumor progression [12, 13]. MiRNA
expression profiles can be used to classify human cancers
and delineate their function as tumor suppressors or
oncogenes [14, 15], and the role of miRNAs as diagnostic,
prognostic and predictive markers is well established in
renal cell carcinoma [16–20], [reviewed in 21, 22]. The
identification and characterization of deregulated miRNAs
after cardiac glycoside treatment may give insight into
their gene/pathway regulation and consequently help to
clarify the molecular basis of their anti-proliferative and
anti-apoptotic effects.

calculated after treatment with the three cardiac glycosides
for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (Table 1). Compared to digitoxin
and AMANTADIG, we detected a similar sensitivity of the
cell lines to ß-methyl-digoxin. Treatment with each of the
three cardiac glycosides for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h identified
Caki-1 cells as the most sensitive cell line, and Caki-2 cells
as the most resistant cell line (Table 1). Next, we studied if
the inhibition activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase by the cardiac
glycosids was correlated to the cytotoxicity in the RCC cell
lines. In general, stronger inhibition activity of the Na+/K+ATPase was correlated with higher cytotoxicity (48 h) on
all RCC cell lines (Figure 1A). In addition, the different
cytotoxicity effects (48 h) of AMANTADIG in the RCC
cell lines are depicted in Figure 1B.

Cell cycle analysis
Treatment with cardiac glycosides, including
digoxin and digitoxin, have been described to inhibit the
cell cycle, especially cell arrest in the G2/M phase of the
cell cycle [7, 23]. Therefore, we studied the effect of three
cardiac glycosides on the cell cycle after treating four cell
lines for 48 h with the IC50 concentrations of each cardiac
glycoside (Figure 2). Digitoxin caused significant G2/M
arrest only in Caki-2 cells. Treatment with ß-methyldigoxin resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest in the three
cell lines 786-O, Caki-1 and Caki-2. Most interestingly,
treatment with AMANTADIG resulted in significant G2/M
arrest in all four renal cell carcinoma cell lines.

miRNA microarray
To better understand the effects of cardiac glycosides,
including the molecular basis of G2/M arrest and involved
signaling pathways, we performed miRNA microarray
analyses. We applied IC50 concentrations of AMANTADIG,
digitoxin and ß-methyl-digoxin to all four cell lines for 72 h.
We detected a distinct clustering of the miRNA expression
profiles according to the applied treatment, showing that
each cardiac glycoside was able to induce characteristic
changes in the miRNA expression patterns (Supplementary
Table 1). Compared with untreated controls, digitoxin
treatment resulted in 7 up- and 10 downregulated miRNAs,
ß-methyl-digoxin treatment resulted in 3 up- and 15
downregulated miRNAs, and AMANTADIG treatment
resulted in 17 up- and 34 downregulated miRNAs
(Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 2). Two miRNAs
showed overlap between all treatments and all cell lines:
miR-670-5p and miR-2278 (Figure 4).

RESULTS
Inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase activity
To investigate effects of AMANTDIG, digitoxin and
β-methyldigoxin on Na+/K+-ATPase activity, all substrates
were assayed with Na+/K+-ATPase α1,2,3 subunit of porcine
cortex. The data indicated an increasing affinity towards
Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition from β-methyldigoxin, digitoxin
to AMANTADIG, with IC50 values ranging between
16.73 µM and 4.78 µM (Supplementary Figure 1).

Cell viability
We studied the effect of cardiac glycoside treatment
on the viability of four RCC cell lines, Caki-1, Caki-2, A498
and 786-O and determined the IC50 values. We previously
described the effect of treatment with the cardiac glycoside
digitoxin and AMANTADIG for 72 h [11]. In this study,
we also included the clinically applied cardiac glycoside
ß-methyl-digoxin in our analysis. IC50 values were

respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, the
KEGG program identified several cancer-associated genes/
pathways in AMANTADIG-treated cells (pathways in
colorectal, pancreatic cancer, glioma, melanoma and chronic
myeloid leukemia; Supplementary Table 1). A comparison
of the three programs showed that two programs consistently
produced overlapping results for the MAPK pathway (WIKI
and KEGG) and the axon guidance pathway (KEGG and
REACTOME). The programs WIKI and REACTOME
showed no overlaps in pathway predictions.
Next, we searched for overlaps between the
identified signaling pathways in terms of the genes
predicted to be regulated by miRNAs and for genes that
overlapped between the different prediction programs
(Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, three prominent
genes belonging to the MAPK pathway and the axon
guidance pathway were targets of miRNAs deregulated
in all cell lines under all treatment conditions. These
genes were MAPK1/ERK2, NRAS and RAC2 (Figure 6).
MAPK1 and NRAS are putative target genes of miR2278 (Table 2). AMANTADIG, digitoxin and ß-methyldigoxin treatments significantly downregulated miR2278 expression compared with that of untreated
control cells (DMSO) by 0.566-fold, 0.647-fold and

In silico prediction of miRNA target genes
Five programs were used to predict the target
genes of all significantly deregulated miRNAs in silico:
miRWalk, Microt4, miRanda, RNAhybrid, and Targetscan.
A gene was considered a potential target of a significantly
deregulated miRNA only when all five prediction programs
identified it concordantly. However, the in silico analysis
revealed 2771 potential miRNA target genes. To further
elucidate the pathways that contain these genes, we applied
pathway enrichment analysis (Supplementary Table 1).

Pathway enrichment analysis
We performed pathway enrichment analysis using
three different programs: WIKI, KEGG and REACTOME.
We considered only pathways that were predicted to be
significantly affected. We identified 7, 2 and 3 pathways
to be significantly affected by all three treatments in all
four cell lines using WIKI, KEGG and REACTOME,

0.551-fold, respectively (Table 2). RAC2 is predicted
to be downregulated by miR-670-5p. Accordingly,
AMANTADIG, digitoxin and ß-methyl-digoxin treatment
significantly downregulated the expression of this gene
by 0.464-fold, 0.371-fold and 0.485-fold, respectively

(Supplementary Table 1). Both MAPK1 and NRAS
have been reported to play a role in G2 cell cycle
checkpoint function [24, 25]. RAC2, a member of the
RAS superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, appears
to stimulate cell growth, cytoskeletal reorganization, and

miRNAs targeting survivin

the activation of protein kinases, and a connection to the
MAPK/ERK pathway has been described [26].

To supplement our results, we assessed the effect
of miRNAs that are deregulated in response to treatment
with cardiac glycosides on a gene known to be involved
in G2/M phase. Thus, we selected survivin (BIRC5),
whose expression has been described to be altered after
digitoxin treatment [7]. Moreover, this gene has also been
described as a G2/M cell phase regulator [27]. Again,
we utilized the five target prediction programs, and the
respective miRNAs were considered only when all
programs identified survivin as a miRNA target gene. After
AMANTADIG treatment, five miRNAs were found to be
able to target survivin: hsa-miR-548ac, hsa-miR-1273g-3p
and hsa-miR-936, which were upregulated; and hsamiR-326 and hsa-miR-525-5p, which were downregulated.
Furthermore, after treatment with ß-methyl-digoxin, one
candidate miRNA was found to be downregulated: hsamiR-4257 (Table 2). Interestingly, 5 miRNAs (miR-326,
miR-525-5p, miR-548ac, miR-1273g-3p and miR-4257)
are predicted to downregulate both survivin and MAPK1,
and 2 miRNAs (miR-525-5p and miR-548ac) are predicted
to downregulate both survivin and NRAS (Table 2),
supporting the hypothesis that these deregulated miRNAs

MAPK1 mRNA and protein expression
The next RNA/protein studies, we focused on
Caki-1 and 786-O cells since Caki-1 cells were the most
sensitive cells and 786-O together with Caki-2 cells were
comparably on the second position in their sensitivity
towards AMANTADIG treatment (Figure 1). Since 786-O
cells are more often applied as RCC model than Caki-2
cells we decided to study them in addition to Caki-1 cells.
MAPK1 mRNA remained unchanged, independent of the
concentration of AMANTADIG applied to both 786-O
and Caki-1 cells (Figure 7). Comparably, the total level
of MAPK1 protein did not change in response to any of
the concentrations of AMANTADIG applied to 786-O and
Caki-1 cells. However, the expression of phosphorylated
MAPK1 (pMAPK1) significantly increased in both cell
lines in response to 15 nM and 25 nM AMANTADIG
compared to that of control cells. A further increase
in the abundance of pMAPK1 in response to 50 nM
AMANTADIG was observed in 786-O cells but not in
Caki-1 cells (Figure 8).

survivin and survivin-delta3 are considered anti-apoptotic,
survivin-2B is considered pro-apoptotic [29]. To delineate
the expression of survivin variants, 786-O and Caki-1
cells were treated with different concentrations of
AMANTADIG and compared to control cells. After
incubating the cells for 48 h with AMANTADIG, we
studied the mRNA expression of wild-type survivin,
survivin-2B and survivin-delta3. We found that treatment

are involved in G2/M cell cycle arrest, possibly in a
concerted manner.

increased the expression of survivin-2B in 786-O cells and
Caki-1 cells, respectively (Figure 9A and 9C). However,
the mRNA levels of wild-type survivin and survivindelta3 were not significantly changed after AMANTADIG
treatment in both these renal cell carcinoma cell lines.

resulted in a strong but not significant reduction of survivin
protein expression (Figure 9D).

DISCUSSION
Cardiac glycosides have been shown to inhibit
cancer cell growth mainly by inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase
signalosome which controls various cellular-physiological
activities, such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, autophagy,
radical oxygen species production, cell motility and cell
cycle arrest [reviewed in 5, 31]. Accordingly, we could
show that increasing concentration of cardiac glycosides
was associated with a decrease of activity of Na+K+ATPase and an increase of cytotoxicity in RCC cell lines.
(Supplementary Figure 1; Figure 1).
In this study, we analyzed the effect of treatment
with three cardiac glycosides, digitoxin, ß-methyl-digoxin
and AMANTADIG, on four renal cell lines in terms of (i)
cell cycle arrest, (ii) miRNA profiles and the consequent
(iii) expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation.
The G2/M cell cycle phase is of special therapeutic
interest because different tumor cells respond most
effectively to radio- and/or chemotherapy during this

Survivin protein expression after treatment with
AMANTADIG
Wild-type survivin is predominantly expressed at
the mRNA level, unlike the survivin-delta3 and survivindelta-2B isoforms [30], which suggests that the majority of
survivin protein is wild-type survivin. We detected only one
dominant band at approximately 17 kDa, which is thought to
represent wild-type survivin. Treatment with AMANTADIG
concentrations of 15.6 nM, 25 nM and 50 nM resulted
in significantly lower survivin expression in 786-O cells
compared to control cells (Figure 9B). The expression of
survivin protein in Caki-1 cells was somewhat ambiguous.
Cells treated with AMANTADIG concentrations of 10 nM
or 15.6 nM showed significantly increased survivin
expression, whereas treatment with 50 nM AMANTADIG

phase [32–35]. Cardiac glycosides have been previously
described to inhibit the cell cycle; specifically, to arrest
cells in the G2/M phase [6, 7, 36–38]. Accordingly,
G2/M arrest was observed in Caki-2 cells after digitoxin
treatment and in 786-O, Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells after
ß-methyl-digoxin treatment. In addition, we showed for
the first time that AMANTADIG can induce G2/M arrest
in renal cell carcinoma cell lines. However, the molecular
basis underlying this cardiac glycoside-induced cell cycle
arrest remains unclear.

This study consisted of two approaches. First,
we analyzed the microRNA expression profiles of four
renal cell carcinoma cell lines after treating them with
AMANTADIG and the other two cardiac glycosides.
Second, we studied the regulation of survivin in these
tumor cells after cardiac glycoside treatment because some
cardiac glycosides are known to induce G2/M arrest via
survivin [7, 39].
After analyzing the miRNA microarray data, we
showed that miR-670-5p and miR-2278 are significantly

downregulated for all cardiac glycoside treatments in the
RCC cell lines. To date, experimentally validated target
genes for both miRNAs have not yet been reported.
To further elaborate the role of deregulated
miRNAs caused by cardiac glycoside treatments, we first
identified in silico targets of the miRNAs, and then these
putative miRNA targets were used as inputs for pathway
enrichment analysis. Our analyses suggested that the
deregulated miRNAs can target MAPK pathway through
regulating the expression of MAPK1, NRAS and RAC2.
To verify the computational result, we investigated
the mRNA and protein level of MAPK1, an in silico
target of miR-2278, in 786-O and Caki-1 cell lines
treated with AMANTADIG. MAPK1 acts as an
oncogene by promoting cell survival, cell proliferation
and cell motility but it also plays a crucial role in cell
cycle arrest when DNA damage is triggered [24, 25,
40–42]. Our data showed the unchanged expression
levels of MAPK1 mRNA and protein but significant
increase of phosphorylated MAPK1 (pMAPK1), which
is the functionally active form of MAPK1. This result

is in agreement with previous publications that cardiac
glycoside (ouabain) does not change total MAPK1
(ERK2) but increases pMAPK1 protein expression in rat
renal epithelial cells, neuroblastoma cells and lung cancer
cells [43–45].
In our second approach, we studied the mRNA
and protein expression of survivin. A G2/M-associated
downregulation of survivin has been described for the
cardiac glycosides calotropin, digitoxin and D6-MA
[7, 39]. Survivin (BIRC5) is a known apoptosis inhibitor
and promotes cell proliferation [46, 47]. Moreover,
survivin, whose expression is predominant in the G2/M
cell phase, supports passage through the pro-meta
and metaphase of cell cycle and ensures cell division/
proliferation [47, 48]. Interestingly, survivin is expressed
in many human cancer tissues but to a much lesser extent
in normal differentiated tissues. Thus, survivin is a
promising target in cancer therapy [49–51]. We showed
that cardiac glycosides may be used to effectively inhibit
survivin and its anti-apoptotic splice variant(s), what is
consistent with previous studies [4, 7]. Treatment with

AMANTADIG significantly reduced the survivin protein
levels in 786-O cells (p53- and Vhl-mutated) but not in
Caki-1 cells (p53- and Vhl-wildtype). Taken together,
our results suggest that the effect of AMANTADIG on
survivin expression can be cell line specific.
Recently, survivin splice variants and their cell
biological functions have been reviewed [28]. Whereas
survivin and survivin-delta3 are anti-apoptotic, survivin-2B
has lost its anti-apoptotic potential and may act as a
naturally occurring antagonist of survivin and survivindelta3 [29, 30]. The survivin variants survivin-delta3
and survivin-2B can heterodimerize with survivin and
consequently regulate the balance between proliferation
and cell death [52]. Remarkably, we observed a significant
increase in survivin-2B mRNA after treating 786-O
and Caki-1 cell lines with AMANTADIG. This work is
the first to describe an increase in survivin-2B mRNA

expression after cardiac glycoside treatment. Moreover,
the expression level of survivin-2B/survivin in stage III
and IV colorectal cancer was lower than that in stage I
and II tumors [53], and reduced survivin-2B mRNA
expression has been associated with colorectal cancer in
the advanced pT stages [54]. In addition, a higher level
of survivin-2B/survivin significantly correlated with a
better prognosis [53]. Lower survivin-2B levels were
also associated with advanced tumor grades and stages in
bladder cancer [55]. For RCC, data on survivin-2B mRNA
are somewhat controversial, whereas a decrease in the
ratio of survivin-2B to survivin mRNA was observed in
Caucasian RCC patients in late tumor stages. In an Asian
RCC cohort, the survivin-2B gene expression levels were
significantly higher in pT3 RCC than in pT1 tumors [56].
In addition, the survivin-2B variant has been shown to
be activated by p53 and to sensitize acute lymphocytic

leukemia cells to chemotherapy with doxorubicin [57].
However, in acute myeloid leukemia patients, higher
survivin-2B mRNA expression levels were associated with
a refractory response to chemotherapy [58]. Overall, the
expression of survivin-2B depends on ethnicity and tumor
type and may consequently have different implications for
tumor treatment with chemotherapy. However, the protein
expression of survivin-2B could not be studied because an
efficient survivin-2B antibody is not available.
Tumor cells can most effectively respond to
radio- and/or chemotherapy during the G2/M-phase
[32–35]. Cardiac glycosides can arrest RCC cells in the
G2/M cell phase, and thus speculating that treatment
with cardiac glycosides can sensitize RCC cells to
radio and/or chemotherapy is tempting. Furthermore,
combination treatment with cardiac glycosides and radio-/
chemotherapies is of great interest for cancer patients but
certainly requires further studies in the future.
In summary, the treatment of RCC cells with
cardiac glycosides, especially AMANTADIG, inhibited
cell proliferation by increasing the number of cells in the
G2/M cell cycle phase. Moreover, miRNA microarray
analyses revealed that miR-670-5p and miR-2278 were
downregulated in RCC cells in response to treatment with
various cardiac glycosides. In addition, we identified the
MAPK signaling pathway as a common target of these
miRNAs in RCC cell lines. Specifically, AMANTADIG
treatment significantly upregulated pMAPK1 expression
in 786-O cells. Furthermore, AMANTADIG treatment
significantly increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic
splice variant survivin-2B in RCC cell lines. These data
suggest a regulatory network between the identified
miRNAs and their target genes/proteins that affects cell
cycle regulation. Moreover, our results may provide a
basis to study combined treatment consisting of cardiac
glycosides and radio-/chemotherapy for RCC in the future.

collection of microorganisms and cell cultures (DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany). The cells were cultured in
DMEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM/L L-glutamine, 1 g/L glucose, 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Cell viability
The colorimetric MTT assay was performed using
3-(4,5-dimethyl-1,3-thiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT). Cells (6000 renal cell carcinoma cells per
well of a 96-well microtiter plate) were cultured for 24, 48
and 72 h with various concentrations of the compounds.
At the indicated time points, MTT was added to a final
concentration of 1 mg/ml, and 200 µl of DMSO was added
after 4-h incubation at 37°C to dissolve the formazan
crystals. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using
a plate spectrophotometer (VersaMax ELISA Microplate
Reader, Molecular Devices, USA). Cells treated with
0.5% DMSO served as a negative control to define 100%
viability. The percentage of viable cells was plotted
against the drug concentration, and the IC50 values were
determined based on the dose-response curves using
GraphPad Prism 6.0 (Graph Pad software, La Jolla, CA).

Cell cycle analysis
To assess cell cycle distribution, cells (9 × 104)
were seeded in 6-well plates and with either digitoxin,
β-methyl-digoxin or AMANTADIG at concentrations
corresponding to the IC50 value. The cells were harvested
after 48 h of incubation and fixed in 90% Methanol/10%
PBS at –20°C. After fixation, the cells were treated with
100 µg/ml RNAse A and stained with 50 µg/ml propidium
iodide (PI) at 4°C overnight. The cells were then analyzed
using a FACS Canto II instrument (Becton Dickinson, BD,
USA), and the percentages of cells in each phase of the
cell cycle (G1, S, and G2/M) were determined using the
FlowJo software v7 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
All chemicals were of reagent grade. Digitoxin,
β-methyl-digoxin and AMANTADIG were obtained
from the substance collection available from the Chair
of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of ErlangenNuremberg. The new semisynthetic cardenolide analog
AMANTADIG ((3β-[2-(1-amantadine)-1-on-ethylamine]digitoxigenin) was previously described [11]. The
compounds were dissolved in DMSO at concentrations
of 20 mM and stored at 4°C. All other chemicals were
obtained from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany).

RNA and protein extraction

Cell lines

miRNA microarrays

The renal cell carcinoma cell lines (A498, 786-O,
Caki-1, Caki-2) were obtained from the German

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. To extract protein, the cells were lysed with
RIPA lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl,
10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1%
NP40, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1 mM sodium vanadate, and
1.5 mM sodium fluoride) for 15 min, and the cell lysates

array contained sequence-specific probes for 2,578 human
miRNAs listed in miRBase v20.0 (http://www.mirbase.

the Partek software v6.2 (Partek, St Louis, MO, USA).

in an LAS-4000 chemiluminescence detection system
(Raytek, Sheffield, UK).

Na+/K+-ATPase assay
Enzymatic activities of Na+/K+-ATPase α1,2,3
subunit of porcine cortex (Sigma) were assayed using
4 mM ATP as substrate in a final volume of 40 µL assay
puffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 80 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 8 mM MgAc2. Negative control was assayed
without enzyme and 4 mM ATP was added after 30 min
of incubation at room temperature. Positive control
contained 0.05 U/mL of Na+/K+-ATPase α1, 2, 3 subunit
of porcine cortex in a 30 min pre-incubated mixture with
assay puffer after 4 mM ATP was added. Inhibition assays
were performed by co-incubating enzyme and inhibitor
with increasing concentrations from 0.2 µM–1000 µM
for 30 min and adding of 4 mM ATP solution. Reactions
were stopped after 30 min of incubation and activity
was determined by measuring the Pi released according
to the malachite-green test [60]. Activity was scored as
the percentage of reduction of absorbance subtracting
the absorbance at 600 nm of the control well, relative to
the positive control well. Positive control defined 100%
enzyme activity. All experiments were performed in
triplicates and the results were expressed at the mean of
IC50 values (drug concentration that reduced enzyme
activity to 50%).

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis
of miRNA expression
For the miRNA analysis, total RNA was reverse
transcribed using the miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Real-time PCR was carried out using the
miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit and QuantiTect Primer
Assays for miR-2278, miR-670-5p, miR-28-5p and
miR-103a-3p (Qiagen). Real-time PCRs were performed in
triplicate in a final volume of 10 µl with the StepOnePlus
Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Darmstadt,
Germany). The relative RNA expression levels were
calculated by applying the ΔΔCt method using miR-28-5p
and miR-103a-3p as reference miRNAs [59].

qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression
First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the
DyNAmo cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, USA). The mRNA transcripts were detected
using PrimeTime qPCR assays (Integrated DNA
Technologies, IDT, Leuven, Belgium). Sequence-specific
primers and fluorescence-labeled probes complementary
to a sequence present in all survivin splice variants (Hs.
PT.56a.1608989.g), survivin-2B (Hs.PT.56a.3536061),
survivin-Δex3 (Hs.PT.56a.21530439), MAPK1 (Hs.
PT.58.39782850), and the endogenous controls GAPDH
(Hs.PT.39a.22214836) and HPRT1 (Hs.PT.58.20881146)
were used. Real-time PCRs were performed in triplicate
in a final volume of 10 µl containing 1× TaqMan
Fast Universal master mix (Life Technologies) and
1xPrimeTime assay. The relative RNA expression levels
were calculated by applying the ΔΔCt method [59].

Statistical analyses
All data of the Na+/K+-ATPase Assay are expressed
as mean ± standard deviation of the mean. Means between
the various groups were compared by two-way ANOVA
analysis. In case of multiple comparisons, a post hoc
Bonferroni correction was applied. P values < 0.001 were
considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed
using GraphPad Prism 5 Software (GraphPad, San Diego,
CA, USA)

Western blotting analysis

Microarray data processing and analyses

Equal amounts of total protein lysates were separated
by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) by electroblotting.
Primary monoclonal antibodies against p44/42 MAPK,
phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), and GAPDH
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, USA). Polyclonal anti-survivin antibody
was purchased from R&D systems (Abingdon, UK).
Secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased
from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Suffolk, UK). Protein
bands were revealed by Western BLoT Ultra Sensitive
HRP Substrate, Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, FR)

The following methods were used to identify
miRNAs that are deregulated in renal cancer cell lines
in response to different cardiac glycosides. The function
celintensityread in the Matlab bioinformatics toolbox
(version 2014b) was applied to read *.cel files generated
by the Affymetrix miRNA 4.0 array. In addition, the
function affysnpannotread was modified to read the
annotation file for the array. As a result, a probe intensity
matrix of 337504 rows and 16 columns was obtained.
The rows and columns of the matrix represent the probe
sets and individual samples designed on the array,
respectively. Next, the function affysnpannotread, which
uses the robust multi-array average method, was applied

to process the probe intensity matrix. This method first
subjected the intensity matrix to background adjustment,
quantile normalization and log2 transformation, resulting
in an expression matrix of 36249 rows and 16 columns.
The rows and columns of the matrix represent features
(e.g., Homo sapiens miRNAs) and individual samples,
respectively. Parts of the expression matrix corresponding
to the expressions of Homo sapiens mature miRNAs
were extracted, and a one-way ANOVA (anova1) was
performed to identify deregulated miRNAs for different
comparisons. The p-values for multiple comparisons
(multcompare) were corrected using Tukey’s honestly
significant difference procedure with a significance
value ≤ 0.05. The miRNAs with corrected p-values ≤ 0.05
were selected as significantly deregulated miRNAs.

miRNA target genes
The miRwalk2.0 database was used to identify the
target genes of the identified deregulated miRNAs [61].
The miRNA target genes predicted in silico by at least five
independent algorithms, including miRwalk2.0, DIANAmicroTv4.0, MiRanda (release 2010), HybridRNA
(version 2.1) and Targetscan (version 6.2), were
extracted. These algorithms predict miRNA target genes
based on common features, such as seed region match,
conservation, free energy, and site accessibility on the 3’
UTRs of target gene mRNAs by mature miRNA sequences
[62, 63]. This strategy ensures more confidence in putative
genes targeted by the deregulated miRNAs than results
from a single miRNA target prediction algorithm, which
usually contains many false positive miRNA targets [64].
