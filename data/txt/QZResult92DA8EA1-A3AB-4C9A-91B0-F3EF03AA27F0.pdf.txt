Abstract
Several components of the Wnt signaling cascade have been
shown to function either as tumor suppressor proteins or as
oncogenes in multiple human cancers, underscoring the
relevance of this pathway in oncogenesis and the need for
further investigation of Wnt signaling components as potential targets for cancer therapy. Here, using expression
profiling analysis as well as in vitro and in vivo functional
studies, we show that the Wnt pathway component BCL9 is a
novel oncogene that is aberrantly expressed in human
multiple myeloma as well as colon carcinoma. We show that
BCL9 enhances B-catenin–mediated transcriptional activity
regardless of the mutational status of the Wnt signaling
components and increases cell proliferation, migration,
invasion, and the metastatic potential of tumor cells by
promoting loss of epithelial and gain of mesenchymal-like
phenotype. Most importantly, BCL9 knockdown significantly
increased the survival of xenograft mouse models of cancer by
reducing tumor load, metastasis, and host angiogenesis
through down-regulation of c-Myc, cyclin D1, CD44, and
vascular endothelial growth factor expression by tumor cells.
Together, these findings suggest that deregulation of BCL9 is
an important contributing factor to tumor progression. The
pleiotropic roles of BCL9 reported in this study underscore its
value as a drug target for therapeutic intervention in several
malignancies associated with aberrant Wnt signaling. [Cancer

Introduction
The Wnt pathway consists of a highly conserved and tightly
regulated receptor-mediated signal transduction system (1–3).
Association of Wnt ligands with Frizzled and low-density
lipoprotein receptor–related protein (LRP5 and LRP6) coreceptors
leads to stabilization of h-catenin, a key event in this signal
transduction pathway. In the absence of Wnt signal, h-catenin is
phosphorylated by a destruction complex consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli, Axin, glycogen synthase kinase-3h, and casein
kinase 1a, marking it for ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. In the presence of Wnt ligands, this destruction complex is

dissociated and the unphosphorylated active h-catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional
activator to activate the expression of target genes, such as c-Myc
and cyclin D1 (4, 5).
Dysregulation of the canonical Wnt/h-catenin pathway has been
implicated in numerous human malignancies, generating immense
interest in these molecules as targets for cancer therapy (6). The
molecular genetics underlying Wnt/h-catenin activation in cancer
centers on mutations that enable h-catenin to escape the
destruction complex and accumulate in the nucleus. Loss-offunction mutations in the tumor suppressors adenomatous
polyposis coli and Axin, as well as activating mutations in
h-catenin, have been identified in several human cancers including
colon carcinomas (6, 7). In addition to these defined mutations,
accumulation of nuclear h-catenin has been shown in multiple
myeloma, which lacks known mutations of the Wnt pathway genes,
indicating alternate pathways for h-catenin activation (8–10). Two
recently identified nuclear Wnt pathway components, BCL9 and
Pygopus, have been shown to play an important role in
transcriptional activity of h-catenin in association with LEF/TCF
family members (11). The BCL9 gene resides on chromosome 1q21,
a region frequently involved in secondary chromosomal abnormalities and associated with poor clinical outcome as well as
overexpression of resident genes (12, 13). BCL9 was identified as
a gene overexpressed in a B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell
line with t(1;14)(q21;q32) translocation (14). In addition, BCL9 has
recently been shown to possess a potent transcription activation
domain (15, 16). Taken together, these findings suggest that BCL9
might behave as an oncogene by providing an alternate pathway
for h-catenin activation and subsequent tumor progression.
Here, we provide evidence that BCL9 deregulation is one
such alternate mechanism of activation. Regardless of the
mutational status of the Wnt signaling components, BCL9
enhanced h-catenin–mediated transcriptional activity in cancers
with (colon carcinoma) and without (multiple myeloma) Wnt/
h-catenin activating mutations. BCL9 is overexpressed in a subset
of multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma primary tumors as well
as cell lines. BCL9 enhanced proliferation, survival, migration,
invasion, and the metastatic potential of tumor cells. In addition,
BCL9 knockdown enhanced the survival of xenograft mouse
models of cancer and attenuated the expression of CD44 and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by tumor cells,
thereby reducing tumor metastasis and host angiogenesis. We
provide evidence for the involvement of BCL9 in the progression of
these malignancies by favoring an epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT)–like differentiation of tumor cells. These data
confirm that BCL9 is involved in tumor progression, underscoring

its relevance as a novel therapeutic target in cancers associated
with dysregulated Wnt activity.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Plasma cells and multiple myeloma cell lines were collected
and maintained as described (8). Colon cancer cell lines were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection and the German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. Control and Wnt3A conditional media
were collected from supernatants of L cells (CRL-2648) and L-Wnt3A cells
(CRL-2647) were from the American Type Culture Collection.
Expression profiling. Affymetrix GeneChip for multiple myeloma
primary tumors, cell lines, and normal plasma cells was obtained from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression
Omnibus.8 RNA from colon carcinoma primary tumors, cell lines, and
normal cells were run on Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array. RNA from
MM1S and Colo320 control shRNA or BCL9 shRNA cells were run on an
Affymetrix U133A 2.0 array chip as described (8). Statistical analyses were
done in R9 using Bioconductor software (17). Probe-set expression values
were generated using ‘‘plier.’’10 Moderated t test was applied and a P-value
cutoff of 0.05 after multiple testing adjustments with BH method was
used (18).
Lentiviral production. The BCL9 cDNA that had an extra base pair at
position 4,171 was removed by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Stratagene). The resulting BCL9 cDNA was similar to the one described
(14) and used for further studies. FLAG-tagged BCL9 cDNA was cloned into
lentiviral pHAGECMV/UBC-green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector. Lentiviral particles were generated in 293T cells as described (8). Two lentiviral
pLKO.1 shRNA-based BCL9 constructs, shRNA1 (gctgcaatacacagtgttatt) and
shRNA2 (cctctgtgaatatccctggaa), showed efficient knockdown in several cell
lines and BCL9 shRNA2 was used for further studies. A puromycin selection
marker from the pLKO.1 shRNA vector was replaced by GFP and GFPpositive cells were sorted 4 days after infection. All assays were all done with
transduced cells that were passaged no more than two times.
Cell proliferation and colony formation assays. Cell proliferation by
[3H]thymidine uptake was measured as described (8). Soft-agar colony
assays were done in RPMI 1640-10% fetal bovine serum as described (19).
Briefly, six-well plates (Falcon) were covered with 2 mL of 0.8% SeaPlaque
agarose (FMC) and allowed to solidify at room temperature. MM1S and
Colo320 cells (500 cells in 200 AL/well) were mixed with 1 mL of 0.5%
SeaPlaque agarose and added on top of the base agar. Colonies were stained
with p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (50 mg/mL; Sigma) and counted after
15 days. Experiments were done in triplicate and repeated twice.
Migration and invasion assays. For migration, the top chamber of
Transwell plates (Corning Costar) were seeded with 2  105 multiple
myeloma cells in triplicates and control L-medium or Wnt3A-containing
medium was added to the bottom chamber. Cells in the bottom wells were
collected and counted after 10 h incubation. For invasion, 2  105 cells per
well were resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 and seeded in Matrigel
Boyden chambers (BD Biosciences) in triplicate with 10% serum-containing
medium as a chemoattractant as well as in regular cell culture plates as
input controls. Following 22 h incubation, cells that migrated through the
chamber were fixed in methanol, stained with crystal violet, and counted.
Experiments were repeated twice.
Antibody generation. A COOH-terminal SmaI-SmaI fragment of BCL9
cDNA corresponding to amino acids 1,198 to 1,404 of human BCL9 was
generated as a GST-fusion protein, purified on a GST column (New England
Biolabs), and injected into rabbit to generate polyclonal antibody sera 6109.
Affinity purification was done using an activated agarose matrix (Rockland).
Affinity-purified BCL9 antibody was tested on the cell lysates overexpressing
FLAG-BCL9 and verified with FLAG-M2 antibody (Sigma).

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was extracted with Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA
synthesis was done with 2 Ag RNA for each sample using SuperScript VILO
cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using Eppendorf
Mastercycler realplex2 and analysis of target genes was done in triplicates
using the SYBR Green quantitative PCR master mix (Fermentas) with the
designated forward and reverse primers: BCL9 (CCAACTTGCCATCAATGAATAA and GGCATCTGATTGGAGTGAGAA), c-Myc (TTTTTCGGGTAGTGGAAAACC and GCAGTAGAAATACGGCTGCAC), cyclin D1 (5TGTCCTACTACCGCCTCACAC and TGGGGTCCATGTTCTGCT), CD44 (TTTGCATTGCAGTCAACAGTC and TGAGTCCACTTGGCTTTCTGT), and VEGF (CATGAACTTTCTGCTGTCTTGG and ATGATTCTGCCCTCCTCCTT). Gene expression values were calculated relative to h-actin expression for each sample.
Immunoblotting analysis. Immunoblot analysis was done as described
previously (8) using antibodies against BCL9 (6109), h-catenin (CAT5-H10;
Zymed), c-Myc (OP10; Calbiochem), BCL9 (ab37305; Abcam), BCL9 peptide
(ab37304; Abcam), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ab9485;
Abcam), and IgE (DB2001; DeltaBiolabs). Antibodies against GFP (B-2),
FLAG-M2, actin-horseradish peroxidase (C-11), and cyclin D1 (H-295) and
secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Southern Biotechnology.
Immunofluorescence analysis. Cell samples were prepared using a
cytocentrifuge (Thermo Shandon; ref. 8) or grown on polylysine-coated
slides. Cells were fixed 20 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in TBS-Tween 20 for 20 min, washed three times in
PBS, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h before
addition of primary antibodies. Immunofluorescence analysis for BCL9
expression was done using the commercially available anti-BCL9 (ab37305;
Abcam). Anti-h-catenin (CAT5-H10; Zymed), vimentin (Vim 3B4; DAKO),
E-cadherin (E10; Cell Signaling), and BCL9 (ab37305; Abcam) antibodies
were added overnight at 4jC and washed in PBS. Secondary antibodies
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (A11034; Molecular Probes) or rhodamine
(5 Ag/mL; Southern Biotechnology) were used. Images were obtained with
Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser scanning confocal or Nikon Eclipse E800
phase-contrast microscope.
Xenograft murine models. GFP-positive MM1S and Colo320 control
shRNA and BCL9 shRNA cells (1  106) were injected into 6-week-old
sublethally irradiated NOD.CB17-PrkdcSCID/J mice (The Jackson Laboratory;
i.v. for MM1S and i.p. for Colo320 cells). Animals were monitored daily and,
when morbid, were euthanized; autopsies were done and tissues were
formalin-fixed. GFP-positive tumors were visualized using the LT-9500
florescent light box (Lighttools Research). Experiments were approved by
and conformed to the standards of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
Histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. Tissue
sections were stained with H&E or incubated with 5 Ag/mL primary
antibodies or a corresponding IgG fraction of preimmune serum in 3%
bovine serum albumin-PBS blocking solution for 16 h at 4jC. Immunohistochemical analysis were done using anti-BCL9 (ab37305; Abcam), anti-hcatenin (CAT5-H10; Zymed), anti-human CD44H (2C5; R&D Systems), and
anti-mouse CD34 (RAM34; eBiosciences) and visualized with the
corresponding biotinylated antibody coupled to streptavidin-peroxidase
complex (Vector Labs). Flow cytometry was done as described previously (8).
ELISA. MM1S and Colo320 control shRNA and BCL9 shRNA cells
(1  106) were cultured for 24 h in triplicates and VEGF levels in
supernatants were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (DuoSet; R&D Systems). Standard curves were linear.

Results

BCL9 Promotes Myeloma and Colon Carcinoma Progression

Figure 1. BCL9 is overexpressed in multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma. A, high BCL9 mRNA expression in multiple myeloma primary tumors (MMPT ) as
well as multiple myeloma cell lines (MMCL ) compared with normal plasma cells (NPC ; left ) and in colon carcinoma primary tumors (CCPT ) as well as colon carcinoma
cell lines (CCCL ) compared with normal colonic mucosa (NCM ) and normal crypt cells (Ncr ; right ). Immunoblot showing increased BCL9 protein expression in
multiple myeloma (left) and colon carcinoma (right ) cell lines (B) and primary tumors (C ). Note that BCL9 protein expression in normal plasma cells and normal colonic
mucosa is negligible. IgE loading control is shown for normal plasma cells and multiple myeloma cells. Normal plasma cells secrete high levels of immunoglobulin,
whereas multiple myeloma cells secrete varying immunoglobulin levels. MM1S (a multiple myeloma cell line) and Colo320 (a colon carcinoma cell line) were used as
BCL9-expressing positive controls in the primary tumor Western blots.

multiple myeloma primary tumors (60%, 38 of 64; P < 0.001) and
multiple myeloma cell lines (64%, 27 of 42; P < 0.0001) compared
with normal plasma cells (n = 24), the normal counterpart of
multiple myeloma (Fig. 1A, left). BCL9 mRNA levels were also
significantly elevated in colon carcinoma primary tumors (68%, 106
of 155; P < 0.0001) and cell lines (65%, 42 of 65; P < 0.0001)
compared with normal colon and normal colon crypt cells (Fig. 1A,
right). The highest level of BCL9 mRNA expression of normal
plasma cells and normal colon cells was used as a stringent cutoff
to determine the percentage of cell lines and primary tumors
expressing elevated BCL9 levels. High levels of BCL9 mRNA were
associated with increased levels of BCL9 protein in multiple
myeloma (left) and colon carcinoma (right) cell lines as well as in
primary tumors (Fig. 1B and C). Cell lines with elevated BCL9
mRNA levels showed increased BCL9 protein expression (data not
shown). Overall, these results document overexpression of BCL9 in
a subset of multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma.

BCL9 promotes proliferation, colony formation, migration,
and the invasive potential of multiple myeloma and colon
carcinoma cells. Transient or stable expression of BCL9 enhanced
h-catenin–mediated transcription as well as cell proliferation in
Colo320 (harbors adenomatous polyposis coli mutation), HCT15
(adenomatous polyposis coli mutation), HCT116 (h-catenin
mutation), and myeloma cells (MM1S, OPM1, and MMS1), which
have no known Wnt pathway gene mutations (Supplementary
Fig. S1; data not shown; ref. 20). These results indicated that
BCL9 overexpression may influence tumor cell proliferation and
progression independent of the mutational status of the Wnt
signaling components. To further investigate the involvement of
BCL9 in different cellular functions, we used gain-of-function and
loss-of-function approaches to either overexpress or knockdown
BCL9 in several cell lines using lentiviral approaches (Fig. 2;
Supplementary Figs. S1C and S2). To rule out that the observed
BCL9 knockdown was not a consequence of off-target RNA

interference effect, two distinct BCL9 shRNAs were tested in colon
carcinoma as well as multiple myeloma cell lines and rescue
experiments were done (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). The
specificity of the anti-BCL9 polyclonal antibodies used in our
studies were also rigorously validated (Supplementary Fig. S4).
We show that BCL9 knockdown reduced MM1S and Colo320 cell
proliferation by 1.3- and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with
control shRNA (scrambled shRNA sequence) cells (Fig. 3A). In
addition, overexpression of BCL9 in MM1S cells significantly
increased the colony-forming ability, whereas BCL9 knockdown
decreased the colony-forming activity of MM1S and Colo320 cells
(Fig. 3B). The ability of BCL9 knockdown to reduce cell numbers
could result from either decreased cell cycle progression or
increased apoptosis. BCL9 knockdown decreased cell proliferation
but did not significantly alter cell survival under multiple stress
conditions (Fig. 3A; data not shown). The Wnt pathway has been
implicated in cell migration of multiple myeloma cells and we
therefore investigated whether MM1S cells with either overexpression or knockdown of BCL9 protein migrated differently in

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

response to the Wnt3A ligand in a Transwell migration assay (10).
BCL9 overexpression increased MM1S cell migration, whereas
BCL9 knockdown significantly reduced migration (Fig. 3C).
Additionally, a 5-fold decrease in adhesive and invasive potential
of Colo320 BCL9 shRNA cells was observed in Matrigel-coated
invasion chambers (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results show
that BCL9 is an important factor in determining the proliferation,
migration, invasion, and the metastatic potential of multiple
myeloma and colon carcinoma cells.
Role of BCL9 in tumor metastasis, survival, and EMT. The
above in vitro results prompted us to investigate whether BCL9
affects survival in xenograft mouse models of multiple myeloma
and colon carcinoma. Therefore, MM1S as well as Colo320 control
shRNA and BCL9 shRNA cells were injected into sublethally
irradiated NOD/SCID mice. BCL9 knockdown significantly increased the survival of mice injected with Colo320 BCL9 shRNA
cells (Fig. 4A). The mean survival for mice with Colo320 control
shRNA and BCL9 shRNA cells was 50 versus 71 days, respectively
(P < 0.0001). Frequent intraparenchymal GFP-positive nodules as

well as tumor metastasis in the liver and kidney were observed in
control shRNA engrafted animals (Fig. 4B). BCL9 shRNA engrafted
animals showed small cellular aggregates and isolated tumor cells
within the parenchyma, suggesting that knockdown of BCL9
efficiently attenuates tumor metastasis and tumor load. In the case
of the multiple myeloma xenograft model, all animals transplanted
with MM1S control shRNA cells developed hind limb paralysis and
died by days 19 to 23 (Fig. 4A). Animals transplanted with MM1S
BCL9 shRNA cells had a mean survival of 30 days compared with

21 days in control mice (P = 0.0001). The control shRNA myeloma
cells metastasized to the bone marrow and showed massive tumor
burden in head, spine, and long bones (Fig. 4C). Histologic
examination of GFP-positive tissues in these control mice
confirmed the presence of an increased tumor load in the bone
marrow of spine that extended into the peridural space, accounting
for the earlier onset of limb paralysis in control animals. Mice
engrafted with MM1S BCL9 shRNA cells showed fewer GFP tumor
nodules, decreased tumor load with smaller foci of cells infiltrating

the bone marrow, and preservation of the peridural space. Multiple
myeloma is an aggressive blood cancer that spreads rapidly to the
brain as well as spinal cord and may be less likely to depend on
EMT for migration and metastasis compared with colon carcinoma
cells, which may explain the difference in the survival between
these two xenograft models. The importance of EMT in metastasis
of epithelial tumors led us to investigate the involvement of BCL9
in EMT. Knockdown of BCL9 altered the subcellular distribution of
epithelial and mesenchymal markers, h-catenin, E-cadherin, and
vimentin (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B). Overall, these results
show the involvement of BCL9 in EMT, tumor metastasis, and
survival.
BCL9 target genes CD44 and VEGF mediate metastasis and
angiogenesis during tumor progression. To further delineate the
role of BCL9 in tumor invasion and metastasis and to gain insight
into the possible Wnt target genes regulated by BCL9, we
performed expression profiling analysis. Principal Component
Analysis of Affymetrix chips revealed good replicates of the
samples, with clear grouping by cell type (multiple myeloma
versus colon carcinoma) as well as treatment (control shRNA
versus BCL9 shRNA; Supplementary Fig. S6A). Using Limma
moderated t test with adjusted P < 0.05, we detected 76 known
genes clustered into four different groups that were differentially
expressed in BCL9 shRNA compared with control shRNA cells
(Fig. 5A; refs. 15, 16). Interestingly, among the 28 down-regulated
genes were two known Wnt target genes, VEGF and CD44 (21, 22).
BCL9 knockdown reduced c-Myc, cyclin D1, CD44, and VEGF mRNA
expression levels in multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma cells
(Fig. 5B). A decrease in c-Myc and cyclin D1 protein expression
was also observed on down-regulation of BCL9 (Fig. 5C). To further validate the expression profiling and quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR results, we characterized the expression of CD44

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

and VEGF by immunohistochemical analysis and ELISA, respectively. Tissue sections from colon carcinoma mouse xenografts
showed strong CD44 staining in the frequent metastatic tumors
that developed in animals transplanted with control shRNA cells
and very weak staining in the tumor cells of the few metastatic
nodules detected in animals transplanted with BCL9 shRNA cells
(Fig. 5D). Down-regulation of BCL9 expression reduced VEGF
secretion by tumor cells as well as in vitro capillary tube–forming
ability of multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma cells (Fig. 5E;
Supplementary Fig. S6B; ref. 23). Immunohistochemical analysis
using an anti-mouse CD34 antibody that recognizes endothelial
cells of murine blood vessels showed a significant reduction in the
number of blood vessels formed within the tumor cells and
decrease in the intensity of CD34 staining in the BCL9 shRNA
multiple myeloma xenograft mice (Fig. 5F). These findings indicate
that BCL9 promotes tumor metastasis and its effects on
angiogenesis are mediated through CD44 and VEGF.
Aberrant BCL9 expression is associated with tumor
progression in multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma.
The above results prompted us to investigate the pattern of
BCL9 expression in a panel of normal human tissues and tumors to
understand its role in tumor progression. Immunohistochemical
studies on normal plasma cells (n = 10), normal colonic mucosa
(n = 10), multiple myeloma bone marrow biopsies (n = 30), and
colon tumor samples (n = 10) showed increased nuclear BCL9
levels in one third of multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma
samples compared with their normal cellular counterparts (Fig. 6).
BCL9 expression was enhanced in the nucleus of multiple myeloma
cells, whereas h-catenin expression was localized to perinuclear
region in these samples; in contrast, normal plasma cells showed
minimal BCL9 and h-catenin staining (Fig. 6A). In agreement
with our RNA expression profiling studies, BCL9 protein expression

was predominantly nuclear in colon carcinoma, whereas the
normal crypt cells were negative for BCL9 staining (Fig. 6B).
However, some of the stromal cells in normal colon stained positive
for BCL9 (Fig. 6B), indicating that it may play a crucial role in
tumor stromal interactions and provide proliferative signals.
Highest levels of BCL9 expression were detected at the invasive
front edge of the tumors where dislodging of micrometastases
and blood vessel penetration take place (Fig. 6C; Supplementary
Fig. S7A; data not shown), indicating a role for BCL9 in tumor
invasion and metastasis. Increased nuclear BCL9 expression was

(Supplementary Fig. S7B). Nuclear colocalization of h-catenin was
also detected at the front edge of the invading tumors (Fig. 6C).
In the premalignant colonic adenomatous polyps analyzed (n = 6),
nuclear BCL9 and nuclear h-catenin expression were observed in
all cases (Fig. 6D). On the other hand, the stalk of the polyp, which
contains normal colonic mucosa, showed no BCL9 staining,
whereas h-catenin staining was predominantly cytoplasmic and
in the membrane. The expression of BCL9 in the colonic

as well as stromal cells suggests a role for BCL9 in progression at
different tumor stages that may be mediated through autocrine or
paracrine mechanisms. Collectively, our findings indicate that
BCL9 is involved in the progression of a broad spectrum of cancers.

Discussion
Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway due to gene mutations,
retention of h-catenin in the nuclei, epigenetic factors that silence
the secreted Frizzled-related protein and Wnt inhibitory factor,
and overexpression of Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptor genes
have been reported in several common human carcinomas (6,
24–26). Constitutively active canonical Wnt/h-catenin pathway
has been documented in multiple myeloma and other hematologic malignancies, although no mutations have been identified,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

suggesting that mechanisms other than gene mutations may
contribute to Wnt pathway deregulation. Here, we provide
evidence that, in multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma,
dysregulation of BCL9 expression is a novel oncogenic mechanism of Wnt pathway activation.
Several genes located on chromosome 1q, including BCL9,
CKS1B, PDZK1, MUC1, and RAB25, are frequent targets of
amplification and are often associated with increased gene dosage
and aberrant expression (12, 13, 27–30). Our study shows that BCL9
expression is negligible in normal plasma and normal colon
mucosa cells, whereas it is highly expressed in a subset of multiple
myeloma and colon carcinoma cells. The marked BCL9 overexpression may be due to an increase in gene dosage of the
BCL9 gene. However, when we analyzed BCL9 DNA copy number
and mRNA expression in multiple myeloma patients, although

BCL9 Promotes Myeloma and Colon Carcinoma Progression

a positive relationship was observed (data not shown), this
correlation was low, indicating that additional mechanisms other
than increased gene dosage may be involved in BCL9 up-regulation.
Previously, it has been shown that the removal of an inhibitory
effect imposed by chromosome 1q12 heterochromatin when BCL9
is translocated to another region of the genome (positional effect)
could also result in aberrant BCL9 expression (31, 32). In another
study, it was shown that BCL9 is a Wnt-inducible h-catenin target
gene and this positive feedback loop may account for its
up-regulation in tumor cells (16). Further studies are needed
to determine whether BCL9 gene mutations, methylation, or
post-translational modifications or all the above may contribute
to additional modes of BCL9 deregulation.
There is increasing evidence for the role of critical pathways
involved in the regulation of metastasis and how tumor cells can
conscript these pathways to create a microenvironment that
enhances their ability to metastasize. Our studies in the xenograft
mouse models of cancers showed a dramatic influence of BCL9 in
mouse survival as well as tumor cell metastasis. We provide
evidence for the involvement of BCL9 in promoting EMT, a
phenomenon involved in the metastasis and progression of
tumors. Our expression profiling data on BCL9 knockdown cells
revealed down-regulation of a subset of genes involved in EMT,
including PTEN, Zyxin, and RAP1A (Fig. 5A; refs. 33, 34).
Furthermore, the expression of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker,
E-cadherin, as well as h-catenin epithelial markers were
modulated by BCL9, whereas another EMT modulator, snail,
was not, supporting our suggestion that BCL9 may be involved in
the regulation of a subset of EMT regulators (35). Based on our
observations, we propose a model wherein aberrant deregulation
of BCL9 confers mesenchymal characteristics to tumor cells,
which enhances cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and
metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Indeed, we show that
BCL9 is highly expressed in the advancing edge and invasive
regions of colon carcinoma and in the vertical growth phase of
malignant melanomas that are associated with increased invasive
and metastatic potential (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Fig. S7; ref. 36).
Our results are in agreement with previous studies documenting a
role of B9L, a relative of human BCL9, in promoting EMT of
nontransformed MDCK cells (37). Up-regulation of human B9L
expression has been reported in colon and breast cancers and has
been implicated in tumorigenesis induced by aberrant activation
of Wnt signaling (38–40). Consistent with these finding, we
observed B9L expression in colon carcinoma as well as multiple
myeloma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S8); however, the B9L
expression pattern is distinct compared with BCL9 expression in
these cells (see Fig. 1B). BCL9 and B9L genes reside on
chromosome 1q21 and 11q23.3, respectively. These regions are
targets of recurrent chromosomal alterations in multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma, suggesting that the molecular
mechanisms underlying BCL9 and B9L regulation may be very
different.
Our gene expression profiling studies identified two known Wnt
target genes, VEGF and CD44, that are down-regulated by
knockdown of BCL9. BCL9 has recently been shown to possess a
COOH-terminal transcriptional activation domain that may
function in a cell type–specific manner (15, 16). This may explain
the results of differentially regulated target gene expression in
multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma BCL9 knockdown cells.
We have established that BCL9 plays an important role in tumor
progression by regulating CD44-mediated tumor metastasis as

www.aacrjournals.org

well as VEGF-mediated host angiogenesis. However, it remains to
be identified whether this regulation is influenced by BCL9 COOHterminal ligand(s). Interestingly, CD44 expression is up-regulated in
several tumors and has been associated with chromosome 1q
amplification as well as tumor progression in breast carcinoma
(41). Given these data and the genomic location of BCL9, one could
speculate that BCL9 may be amplified and overexpressed in these
breast tumors, leading to up-regulation of CD44 and tumor
progression of breast cancer and other malignancies associated
with chromosome 1q amplification. There is also mounting
evidence that VEGF plays a pivotal role in the proliferation of
endothelial cells in the vascular-rich tumor microenvironment,
promoting tumorigenesis via angiogenesis. Interestingly, the VEGF
promoter has recently been shown to consist of two TCF binding
sites, lending support to our findings on BCL9 regulation of VEGF
(42). Attenuation of VEGF secretion by tumor cells and suppression
of tumor vasculature formation on knockdown of BCL9 as
documented in our studies highlights the need for the development
of BCL9 inhibitors to arrest tumor angiogenesis and progression.
Small-molecule inhibitors and antibodies targeting crucial Wnt
protein complexes, downstream target genes, as well as activators
and ligands of the Wnt pathway have been proposed as potential
tools for therapeutic intervention against cancer cells (6). A major
potential limitation of therapies that aim to target Wnt/h-catenin
is its importance in normal adult tissue functions such as stem cell
regeneration, wound healing, and cell proliferation (43). Our
findings that BCL9 expression is negligible in normal plasma cells
and normal colon cells compared with multiple myeloma and
colon carcinoma cells may provide a rationale for targeting BCL9 in
cancers without majorly affecting the normal stem cell compartment. This possibility is highlighted by the recent structural
elucidation of the interactions between BCL9/h-catenin/TCF4,
suggesting that disruption of the BCL9/h-catenin interaction
carries the potential for selective therapeutic interventions (44).
In summary, this study provides critical insight into the role of
the BCL9 oncogene in the progression of multiple myeloma and
colon carcinoma. We have shown that BCL9 plays fundamental
roles in tumor progression by regulating proliferation, migration,
invasion, angiogenesis, and the metastatic potential of tumor cells.
The pleiotropic roles of BCL9 and its up-regulation in a variety of
frequent human cancers highlight its importance as a novel
therapeutic target in the treatment of cancers associated with
deregulated Wnt signaling.
