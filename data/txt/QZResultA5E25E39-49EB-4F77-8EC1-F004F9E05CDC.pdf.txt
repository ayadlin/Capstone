Abstract
Tumor development relies upon essential contributions from the tumor microenvironment and host immune
alterations. These contributions may inform the plasma proteome in a manner that could be exploited for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we employed a systems biology approach to characterize the plasma
proteome response in the inducible HER2/neu mouse model of breast cancer during tumor induction,
progression, and regression. Mass spectrometry data derived from approximately 1.6 million spectra identified
protein networks involved in wound healing, microenvironment, and metabolism that coordinately changed
during tumor development. The observed alterations developed prior to cancer detection, increased progressively with tumor growth and reverted toward baseline with tumor regression. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested that the cancer-associated plasma proteome was derived from
transcriptional responses in the noncancerous host tissues as well as the developing tumor. The proteomic
signature was distinct from a nonspecific response to inflammation. Overall, the developing tumor simultaneously engaged a number of innate physiologic processes, including wound repair, immune response,
coagulation and complement cascades, tissue remodeling, and metabolic homeostasis that were all detectable
in plasma. Our findings offer an integrated view of tumor development relevant to plasma-based strategies to
detect and diagnose cancer. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5090–100. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The tumor microenvironment and host factors play a major
role in the establishment, progression, and metastatic dissemination of cancer (1). Stromal fibroblasts, myofibroblasts,
endothelial cells, and immune cells provide growth factors,
proteases, and angiogenic potential to support tumor growth
(2, 3). Dendritic cells and recruited T and B cells, regulatory T
cells, macrophages, and other myeloid-derived suppressor
cells, contribute both positively and negatively to multiple
stages of tumor progression (4–7). Tumors can also recruit

progenitor cells from the bone marrow to promote angiogenesis and to establish premetastatic niches in distal organs such
as the lung (8–10). To date, these tumor–host interactions
have been primarily studied at the cellular and tissue levels,
and it remains unclear up to what extent they contribute to
the changes in the plasma proteome, particularly at early
stages of tumor development. Proteomic advances currently
allow in-depth quantitative profiling of biological fluids, such
as plasma spanning of more than 6 logs of protein abundance
(11, 12). Application of proteomics to mouse models provides
a number of distinct advantages to interrogate the systems
biology of cancer (13, 14).
We utilized a conditional transgenic neu-induced mouse
model of mammary cancer to determine the extent and source
of changes in the plasma proteome at predetermined stages of
tumor development (15). The neu is an activated rat homologue of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(ErbB2) gene. ErbB2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase amplified
and overexpressed in more than 25% of human breast cancers,
and signaling from this oncogene is a central driver in breast
cancer development. When induced with doxycycline, bitransgenic MMTV-rtTA/TetO-NeuNT mice synchronously develop
invasive mammary carcinomas that recapitulate the morphologic, pathologic, and molecular features of ErbB2-positive
human breast cancer (16). Doxycycline withdrawal results in

transgene de-induction and tumor regression, mimicking
responses of tumors to targeted therapy. We applied in-depth
quantitative proteomic profiling to this model and identified a
set of proteins that changed in relative abundance in plasma
during tumor induction, progression, and regression. Database mining, cross-referencing proteomic data with transcript
profiles, and confirmatory cell-type localization studies
revealed that tumor cells, the microenvironment, and systemic responses contribute to the dynamic changes in the
plasma proteome with tumor development and progression.

Materials and Methods
Tissue collection
Bitransgenic FVB MMTV-rtTA/TetO-NeuNT "case" and
monotransgenic FVB TetO-NeuNT "control" mice (15) were
paired at weaning and maintained in the same cage. Doxycycline (2 mg/mL) was added to drinking water starting at
8 weeks of age. Mice were palpated every other day to detect
mammary tumor growth. Each pair of case and control mice
was euthanized on the same day by CO2 inhalation and plasma
was collected as described (13).
Plasma proteomic analysis
The plasma proteomics workflow has been previously
described (17). In brief, case and control plasma pools
(250–315 mL/pool) from 5 to 11 mice were immunodepleted
(3 abundant proteins, MS-3; Agilent). Samples were concentrated and reduced with dithiothreitol. Isotopic intact protein labeling of cysteine residues was done with control
samples receiving 12C-acrylamide (Fluka), and case samples
receiving 13C-acrylamide (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories).
Case and control pools were combined for 2-dimensional
high-performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu) protein separation. Anion-exchange chromatography (Poros
HQ/10; Applied Biosystems) used an 8-step elution (0–
1,000 mmol/L NaCl). Anion-exchange fractions were separated by reversed-phase chromatography (Poros R2/10).
Lyophilized fractions were digested with trypsin and 96
fractions per tumor stage were analyzed by a LTQ-Orbitrap
(Thermo) mass spectrometer and NanoLC-1D (Eksigent).
Online reversed-phase peptide separation and tandem mass
spectrometry (MS-MS) of the 5 most abundant þ2 or þ3
ions (m/z 400–1,800) were conducted.
Each tumor stage analysis yielded approximately 4,000,000
spectra, which were searched against the mouse International
Protein Index (IPI) database (v.3.48) by using X!Tandem with
comet scoring (18–21). PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet
(22) were used for validation and protein inference. Quantification was done by Q3 (23). Identifications with PeptideProphet probability greater than 0.2 were submitted to
ProteinProphet. Proteins were filtered using greater than
5% error rate. Protein ratios were computed from peptides
with PeptideProphet probability greater than 0.75. Proteins
with multiple IPIs and single gene name were combined (log2
average of peptides) to give 1 ratio per gene name.
For proteins with multiple paired MS events of heavy and
light acrylamide, first, a 2-tailed Student's t test was used to

www.aacrjournals.org

calculate a P value for the mean case/control ratio of the
protein. Second, the probability for the case/control ratio for
each MS event was calculated from the distribution of ratios in
control/control experiments in which the same sample was
labeled with heavy and light acrylamide. On the basis of the
control/control experiments, if the P value for each individual
event was less than 0.05, the overall protein ratio was considered significant.
Breast cancer cell line profiling
The cell line methods are previously described (24). MCF7,
MDA-MB-231, and SKBR3 cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), cultured for less
than 6 months, and were not reauthenticated. Cells were
cultured for 7 passages in SILAC DMEM [Invitrogen; dialyzed FBS, 13C-lysine; (25)]. After 48 hours, secreted proteins
were obtained from media. For total cell extract, cells were
sonicated and centrifuged to remove debris. For cell surface
proteins, cells were biotinylated, extracted, sonicated, and
captured by an avidin column. One milligram of each of
secreted, total cell extract, and cell surface proteins was
reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide and fractionated
by reversed-phase chromatography. Fractions were digested
with trypsin and subjected to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS as described above.
Immunoassays
Rules Based Medicine RodentMAP v2.0 Luminex immunoassays measured 58 proteins in plasmas. Plasma levels of
insulin-like growth factor–binding protein 5 (Igfbp5), metallopeptidase inhibitor-1 (Timp1), lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), galectin1 (Lgals1), and C-C motif chemokine 8 (Ccl8) were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer's
protocol.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissues were processed and stained with calreticulin (Calr;
Abcam), Lgals1 (R&D Systems), lactotransferrin (Ltf; Abgent),
S100a9 (NovusBio), Pdz and lim domain protein (Pdlim1;
Abcam), smooth muscle actin (SMA; Thermo), Timp1 (Abbiotec), Vasp (Abcam), or Igfbp5 (Santa Cruz) antibodies by using
a standard 3-step technique (26). Collagen staining was done
using the Sigma Trichrome Kit. The University of Washington
Histology Core conducted CD3 and F4/80 staining. Twelve
tumors were stained. For each antibody all tumors showed
similar staining patterns.

Results
Histologic evaluation of mammary tumor induction,
progression, and regression
Cohorts of MMTV-rtTA/TetO-NeuNT "case" and TetONeuNT "control" mice were sacrificed at 4 time points during
tumor development (Fig. 1A). After 5 weeks on doxycycline
and prior to clinically detectable lesions, mammary
duct hyperplasia, intraepithelial neoplasia, and microinvasive
carcinoma were apparent (Fig. 1B). By 8 to 12 weeks, 0.5-cm
tumors consisted of hyperplastic nodules of intraepithelial

1-cm breast tumors were classified as mammary adenocarcinomas with areas of local invasion. Neoplastic cells were
supported by vascular stroma and fibrous connective tissue,
indicating a desmoplastic reaction. Inflammatory cell infiltrates included lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages,
plasma cells, and mast cells. Doxycycline was withdrawn
from mice bearing approximately 1-cm tumors and plasma
samples were taken 3 days later, when tumors had visibly
decreased in size. Histologic evaluation showed regressing
mammary trees with ductal ectasia, inflammation, and
fibrosis. Plasma from case and control mice at each of these
4 tumor stages was pooled and subjected to differential
isotopic labeling, extensive protein fractionation, and LC/
MS-MS analysis of tryptic digests from individual fractions
(17). The same plasma pools were analyzed using Rules
Based Medicine Luminex/Rules Based Medicine, which measured 58 proteins representing cytokines, growth factors,
and other signaling proteins.

Changes in the plasma proteome prior to clinical
evidence of cancer
Plasma samples from preclinical tumor-bearing mice
yielded 49 proteins with increased and 17 with decreased
concentrations in case compared with control mice (>1.5fold change, P < 0.05; Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table S1).
These proteins were grouped by function, biological process,
and cellular localization. Proteins involved in acute-phase
response, immune cell signaling—including cytokines, chemokines, and macrophage and neutrophil signaling proteins—and cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix (ECM)
functions were increased (Fig. 2). Response to wounding
was the most significant biological process altered in the
proteome of mice with preclinical neoplasia (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Analysis of the subset of proteins known to be
extracellular identified the acute-phase response and the
coagulation and complement systems as the most significantly altered pathways (Supplementary Figs. S1B and S2).
Among the altered plasma proteins with known intracellular

localization, those involved in glycolysis, fatty acid, and
amino acid metabolism predominated (Supplementary
Table S2).
Of the 49 plasma proteins that increased in relative abundance in mice with preclinical neoplasia, 22 were identified in
proteomic profiling experiments from 3 human breast cancer
cell lines, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and SKBR3 (Supplementary
Table S2). SKBR3 cells overexpress ErbB2 and have been
utilized extensively to study ErbB2 signaling (27, 28). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of preclinical tumor sections
showed cytoplasmic and/or nuclear localization in tumor cells
for all 5 proteins for which antibodies were available (Fig. 3),
suggesting that release from tumor cell turnover could contribute to increased plasma levels of these proteins. Calr is a
calcium-binding chaperone protein reported to have prognostic significance in breast cancer based on tissue expression
(29). Lgals1 is induced by ErbB2 (30), binds to H-ras, and
mediates cell transformation (31). Ltf is an iron-binding
protein that is secreted by breast tissue. Calgranulin B
(S100A9) is a calcium-binding protein present in a wide range
of cells and overexpressed in neutrophils, monocytes, and
tumor cells (32). The Pdlim1 associates with actin filaments
and stress fibers.

To determine the extent to which protein changes
detected at this early time point may be specifically
associated with tumor development, we cross-referenced
these data to similar plasma proteomic profiling from
mouse models of subacute and chronic inflammation
and angiogenesis (33). Of the 49 proteins with increased
concentration in plasma from mice with early-stage breast
cancer, 12 were increased in the plasma of 1 or more of
the confounding mouse models (Supplementary Table S2),
indicating these 12 proteins are not breast cancer specific.
Levels of S100a9, Pdlim, Ltf, Calr, and Lgals1 that were
detected in primary tumors by IHC (Fig. 2) were not
increased in the confounder models, thereby increasing
their potential cancer specificity (see Supplementary
Table S2 for additional examples). Interestingly, a greater
percentage (50%) of proteins with decreased concentration in preclinical plasmas were decreased in confounding
condition models, indicating that reduced proteins are less
likely to be cancer specific.
Thus, even at a relatively early stage of tumor development,
changes were observed in the plasma proteome reflecting
contributions from tumor cells, the microenvironment, and
the host response. Proteins involved in functions relevant to

Plasma proteome changes associated with tumor
progression
To identify plasma protein changes associated with tumor
progression, we profiled the plasma proteome of mice bearing
0.5- and 1-cm breast tumors. The overall numbers of proteins
that showed altered plasma levels in case versus control mice
progressively increased with tumor growth (Fig. 1C). In mice
bearing 0.5-cm tumors, 38 proteins showed a significant
increase and 105 a decrease in abundance, whereas in mice
bearing 1.0-cm tumors, 70 proteins were increased and 114
were decreased (>1.5, P < 0.05; Supplementary Table S2). As in
the preclinical samples, proteins that increased in mid- and
late-stage tumor-bearing mice included those identified in
proteomic profiling of human breast cancer cells, as well as
proteins involved in the acute-phase response, complement,
and coagulation cascades, chemokines, macrophage and
neutrophil signaling, and metabolic proteins (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. S2). A number of cytoskeletal, ECM,
and stroma-associated proteins including Loxl1, Tnc, matrix
metalloproteinase (Mmp) 9, Timp1, Dsg2, Fbln2, Col15a1,
Pxdn, Prg4, and Vwf increased in their levels. Interestingly,
only 1 of 30 of these tissue-remodeling proteins was identified
as increased in plasma from the confounder mouse models
(Fig. 2), suggesting a substantial contribution of the stroma to
plasma protein changes associated with tumor development.
It is noteworthy that a greater proportion of plasma proteins were reduced in abundance, rather than increased in
plasma from mice with mid- and advance-stage tumors
(Fig. 1C). Decreased proteins that were unique to tumorbearing mice included metabolic proteins and 10 components
of the proteasome (Psma1, Psma2, Psma4, Psma7, Psmb1,
Psmb10, Psmb6, Psmc5, Psmd4, and Psme1; Supplementary
Table S2). Approximately a quarter of the proteins with
reduced levels in mice with clinically apparent breast cancer
were decreased in plasma from mice with inflammation or
angiogenesis (Fig. 4). These data indicate that decreased

5094

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

protein abundance associated with cancer can be attributed
to metabolic changes, reduced proteasomal components, as
well as host responses that are not cancer specific.
We next examined the extent and potential contribution of
altered gene expression in both primary tumor and nontumor
host tissues to changes in the plasma proteome. Gene expression profiling was conducted on blood buffy coat, thymus,
spleen, liver, and breast tumors from mice with 1-cm tumors,
using an independent cohort of case and control mice (34). Of
the 31 proteins that were increased in plasma from tumorbearing mice and identified in proteomic profiling of breast
cancer cells, 25 (81%) showed a corresponding increase in

expression in HER2/neu breast tumors as compared with
normal breast tissue (Supplementary Fig. S3). Twelve of these
proteins (Flna, Vasp, Cnn2, Coro1a, Cap1, Pxdn, Dsg2, Tpm4,
Pfn1, Cotl1, Zyx, and Ctsd) are involved in cytoskeletal function or ECM remodeling, processes that are necessary for
tumor cell invasion. None of these proteins increased in
concentration in plasma from the confounder models. The
concordance between protein levels in plasma, protein expression in breast cancer cells, and mRNA expression in HER2/
neu-driven tumors for these proteins indicates a contribution
of tumor cells to their increased levels in plasma.
To determine the contributions of the tumor microenvironment to increased levels of proteins in plasma, we
used IHC to examine the cellular and stromal landscape of
HER2/neu mammary tumors. In addition to tumor cells,
HER2/neu tumors contained macrophage, neutrophil, and
lymphocyte infiltrates, fibroblasts, extensive collagen
deposition, and prominent blood vessels (Fig. 5). Plasma
proteins that could be derived from tumor cell interactions
with these recruited cell types and the local environment
are also displayed according to function (immunity,
ECM, cytoskeletal, and angiogenesis). Note the examples

of Timp1 and Vasp that were elevated in plasma and
expressed in tumor cells.
For 14 proteins that were increased in plasma of tumorbearing mice and that are known to be involved in myeloid cell
function, we compared the corresponding mRNA expression
levels in thymus, spleen, and blood buffy coat fractions that
are rich in white blood cells. Of these 14 proteins, 13 had
increased levels of mRNA expression levels in 1 or more of
these tissues from tumor-bearing versus control mice (Supplementary Fig. S4). Lcn2, S100a9, S100a8, neutrophilic granule protein (Ngp), myeloperoxidase (Mpo), and peptidoglycan
recognition protein (Pglyrp1) were the most significantly
increased in both plasma and immune cell compartments,
suggesting the increased levels of these proteins in plasma
reflect an immune cell response to the developing tumor.
S100a9 and Lcn2 are examples of proteins identified as
increased in both immune cells and tumors. A set of 27 genes
showed significantly increased mRNA expression in the thymus in case versus control mice (P < 0.05; ref. 34). Proteins
corresponding to 7 of the 27 genes were increased in the
plasma, suggesting a contribution of distal immunologic
tissues to their increased plasma levels.

proteins progressively decreased in their levels during tumor
development but rebounded after tumor regression (Fig. 6).
These proteins are mainly involved in acute-phase response,
and many were also decreased in the confounder inflammation models. Pathway analysis was used to assess the biological processes behind these dynamic changes in the plasma
proteome that accompanied tumor development. Proteins
involved in wound healing, the complement pathway, and
metabolism were altered at multiple tumor stages (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Reversion of the plasma proteome toward baseline
after oncogene de-induction and tumor regression
To identify plasma protein changes associated with earlystage tumor regression, we quantitated protein changes in
plasma from mice 3 days after doxycycline withdrawal and
oncogene de-induction (Fig. 1). At this time point, only 24
proteins had increased levels and 28 decreased levels in case
versus control mice (Supplementary Table S2). Many proteins
increased in tumor-bearing mice were undetected or returned
to baseline levels after oncogene de-induction. Of the 12 that
remained elevated, 8 were immune cell or acute-phase proteins (Hp, C8g, Ccl8, EG214403, Mpo, Cd40l, Orm3, and Hpx).
Changes in acute-phase proteins and complement have also
been observed in plasma from epirubicin/docetaxel-treated
breast cancer (35).

Confirmation of LC/MS-MS detected changes in protein
abundance by independent antibody-based methods
Four proteins that span a wide range of concentrations in
normal plasma and that exhibited altered plasma levels in
tumor-bearing mice on the basis of LC/MS-MS analysis were
subjected to validation by ELISAs applied to samples from
independent cohorts of mice. Protein concentrations of
Igfbp5, Lcn2, Timp1, and Ccl8 were found to progressively
increase during tumor development and return to normal
after regression, concordant with MS data (Fig. 7). We also
quantified levels of 37 proteins using bead-based assays
applied to plasma samples from all 4 tumor stages. Thirteen
of these showed increased levels in case versus control mice
for at least 1 tumor stage (Supplementary Table S3). These
included Cd40 ligand, monocyte and macrophage signaling
proteins, and stromal proteins Mmp9, Timp1, and Vwf. Seven
of these proteins were quantified by LC/MS-MS, and again
there was substantial agreement between the 2 measurement

Comparative analysis of the plasma proteome at
different tumor stages
Comparison of the plasma proteome from mice with 0.5and 1.0-cm tumors revealed a significant positive correlation
(Pearson correlation coefficient r ¼ 0.67) in relative protein
abundance, indicating many of the same proteins are either
reduced or increased at both tumor stages (Fig. 4). Some
proteins were quantified at all 4 tumor stages. Papln, Ltf,
Igfbp5, S100a8, Lrg1, Pcsk9, and Ccl8 are examples of proteins
that showed progressive increases in relative abundance
during tumor progression and diminished to near control
levels after tumor regression (Fig. 6). Of these, Ltf and Igfbp5
were expressed in tumor cells as assessed by IHC. A set of

these results illuminate the dynamic changes in the plasma
proteome that track tumor evolution.

Discussion
The cancer-associated plasma proteome is derived
from the developing tumor, the tumor
microenvironment, and host tissues
In this study, we present a dynamic analysis of the plasma
proteome that accompanies HER2/neu-induced mammary
tumor establishment, malignant progression, and regression.
Our findings show that the plasma proteome increasingly
deviates from normal as tumors develop and progress. This
presented as an escalation in the total number of altered
proteins as well as a progressive increase or decrease in the
relative abundance of a number of specific proteins with
advancing tumor stage. Most of these tumor-associated protein changes rapidly reverted upon oncogene downregulation
and incipient tumor regression. Thus, the plasma proteome
responds very early, that is, shortly after tumor induction,
changes both qualitatively and quantitatively during tumor
progression, and rapidly reverts to normal following oncogene
downregulation and tumor regression.

Control

We used several methods to ascertain the specificity and
tissue(s) of origin of the plasma protein signature that
occurred in the context of breast tumor development. First,
comparisons with mouse models of inflammation and
angiogenesis were used to identify those proteins that were
not cancer specific. Approximately 25% of the elevated and
50% of the reduced proteins overlapped between tumor and
confounder plasma proteomes. This indicates that the
proteins that decrease in abundance in tumor-bearing mice
are more likely attributable to a host response that is not
specific to cancer. In the future, analysis of other confounder models such as wound-healing or tissue-specific inflammatory conditions will be useful to further refine the
cancer-specific signature. Second, we compared plasma
proteins identified in tumor-bearing mice to proteomic
and gene expression analyses of human breast cancer cells
and HER2/neu-induced breast tumors. Among all the proteins that were increased in plasma from tumor-bearing
mice, more than half were identified in the proteomic
profiling of human breast cancer cell lines and approximately 80% of this concordant set showed a corresponding
increase in gene expression in HER2/neu breast tumors.
Third, a subset of those proteins found to be altered in the
plasma of tumor-bearing mice was expressed in tumor cells
as detected by IHC. These findings point to the tumor itself

as the likely source of a subset of proteins found to be
altered in plasma. In addition to the secretion of proteins by
tumor cells, tumor cell lysis may also lead to detectable
levels of cancer-specific proteins in the blood. Finally,
microarray gene expression analysis of known inflammatory
proteins identified a correlation between protein levels in
plasma and gene expression in distal immunologic tissues
such as thymus and spleen. Collectively, these findings show
that changes in the plasma proteome that arise during
cancer development derive from multiple sources: nonspecific systemic reactions, for example, acute-phase proteins
such as those produced by the liver; other host responses
that are more specific to breast cancer, but not directly
tumor derived, for example, proteins involved in immune
cell recruitment and signaling, and metabolic pathways;
and proteins that originate directly from the tumor and
the local microenvironment (Fig. 5). Some proteins are
expressed in multiple tissues (e.g., S100a9, Lcn2, metabolic,
and other housekeeping proteins) and unambiguous ascertainment of tissue of origin is more difficult.
Plasma proteome dynamics reflect breast cancer
biology
After only 5 weeks of HER2/neu oncogene activity,
extensive neoplastic changes were noted throughout the
mammary ductal tree. Although the lesions were clinically
undetectable, significant changes in the plasma proteome
were already apparent, and these reflected acute-phase
responses, macrophage and neutrophil trafficking, ECM
remodeling, metabolism, and potentially tumor-derived
proteins. A significant fraction of these early plasma
proteome alterations were not seen in models of inflammation and so are more likely to be associated with earlystage cancer. A number of the candidate tumor-derived
proteins, such as Igfbp5, Ltf, Timp1, Lgals1, Mmp9, Vwf,
Calr, and Pdlim1, that were increased in preclinical plasma
were also seen in tumor sections and/or breast cancer cell
lines based on IHC or gene expression changes. A subset of
these was confirmed to be elevated in plasma from other
cohorts of mice and by independent antibody-based methods. Furthermore, the plasma levels of some of these
proteins increased with tumor size and rapidly fell after
oncogene de-induction, indicating they effectively track
tumor growth. This establishes both the sensitivity of
our method to detect tumor-associated proteins very early
in the neoplastic process and also the ability to monitor
protein levels over the course of tumor development and
during tumor regression.
Notable histopathologic changes that occurred during
tumor progression included extensive remodeling of the
tumor microenvironment, in particular, recruitment of
immune cells, including T and B cells, macrophages, and
neutrophils. This presentation resembles a wound bed and
implies that the tumors actively attract these cells from the
circulation. In support of this conclusion, plasma levels of
multiple macrophage signaling proteins, including monocyte chemoattractant proteins (Mcps), macrophage inflammatory proteins (Mip), and other chemokines, calgranulins,

5098

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

and lipocalin 2, were increased. Many of these proteins
were elevated even at the earliest tumor stage and progressively increased in abundance with tumor growth. Once
recruited to the tumor site, tumor-associated macrophages
(TAM) secrete Mmp2, Mmp9, TGFb, cathepsins, and other
factors that degrade and remodel matrix (36) as well as
promote angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis
(37). Our analysis showing elevated plasma levels of Mmp9,
Ctsb, and numerous stromal components associated with
TAMs extends the reach of this network to the organismal
level.
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are another significant component of the HER2/neu mammary tumor microenvironment (Fig. 5). These "activated" fibroblasts express
smooth muscle actin (38) and support tumor growth,
deposit ECM, and promote an inflammatory response by
secreting factors such as collagens, tenascin C, Mmps, and
chemokines (2, 3). Tumor cells, in turn, must reorganize
cytoskeletal structures, break down the basement membrane, and degrade ECM components to invade, intravasate, and metastasize. The levels of many proteins related
to these processes, including ECM, stromal, and cytoskeletal proteins, were increased in plasma, particularly from
mice with late-stage tumors. Together this shows that, in
addition to nonspecific host response proteins and tumorderived proteins, alterations in signaling and effector pathways regulating tumor–TAM and tumor–CAF interactions
are prominent features of the cancer-associated plasma
proteome. These features bear similarities to a wound
response (39), which has recently been described to parallel
tumor initiation (40), and indicate the extent to which
the tumor co-opts these host responses. This establishes
the plasma proteome as a sensitive biomonitor of the
ongoing interaction between the developing tumor and
the host.
Altered plasma levels of enzymes involved in glucose, lipid,
and amino acid metabolism were observed at all 3 tumor
stages. Liver transcriptional profiling identified altered expression of similar metabolic enzymes in case versus control mice
(34), indicating the presence of a tumor triggers systemic
metabolic dysregulation, and this initiates very early during
tumor establishment. It will be interesting to determine the
mechanistic similarities between this response and cachexia,
which is an altered systemic metabolic response to the presence of late-stage cancer (41).
In summary, this study highlights the value of integrating
in-depth proteomic, transcriptomic, and tissue-wide
approaches as a means to illuminate the systems biology
of cancer. The identification of plasma protein networks and
transcriptional responses in distal normal tissues of tumorbearing mice indicates the host senses and responds to
neoplastic growth to a greater degree than previously appreciated. The developing tumor simultaneously engages a
number of innate physiologic processes including wound
repair, the immune system, the blood coagulation and
complement cascades, and metabolic homeostasis. This
extensive conversation initiates very early, involves many
cell types and tissues, accurately tracks tumor development

over time, and mirrors the underlying biology. Further
mining of the cancer-associated plasma proteome and other
host tissue responses will likely identify additional regulators, mediators, and biomarkers of the evolving tumor, its
microenvironment, and the systemic response to cancer.
Extension of this approach to other models of cancer as well
as human studies will establish its utility for early detection,
diagnosis, and prognosis.
