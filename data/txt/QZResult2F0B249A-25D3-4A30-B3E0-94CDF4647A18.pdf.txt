Fentanyl Buccal Tablet for the
Treatment of Breakthrough Pain in
Opioid-Tolerant Patients With
Chronic Cancer Pain
A Long-term, Open-Label Safety Study
Sharon M. Weinstein, MD1; John Messina, PharmD2; and Fang Xie, PhD2

BACKGROUND: This study assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) in
opioid-tolerant patients with cancer and breakthrough pain (BTP) who were either naive to FBT or had
completed 1 of 2 previous double-blind, placebo-controlled FBT studies (rollover patients). METHODS:
Patients who were FBT-naive underwent titration to find a successful FBT dose. Rollover patients used a
previously identified successful dose of FBT. Patients who achieved a successful dose were eligible to enter
a maintenance phase (12 months). Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), physical and neurologic examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-two patients were enrolled.
A total of 112 entered titration; 79 identified a successful FBT dose, and 77 of these patients entered the
maintenance phase along with 120 rollover patients (n ¼ 197). AEs resulted in discontinuation of therapy
for 33% of patients. The most common AEs were generally typical of opioids administered to cancer
patients. All serious AEs were considered to be related to the patients’ underlying conditions, except for 1
incident of FBT-related drug withdrawal syndrome. Sixty patients died after enrollment because of disease
progression. Fifteen (6%) patients experienced 1 application-site AE, all of which were considered by
investigators to be related to FBT. CONCLUSIONS: FBT was generally well tolerated and had a favorable
safety profile in the long-term (12 months) management of patients with persistent cancer pain and BTP.
No unexpected AEs occurred. Safety and tolerability was similar to that observed in short-term studies.

Original Article

The majority (65%) of cancer patients with controlled,
persistent pain experience transitory moderate to severe
exacerbations, or flares, of pain referred to as breakthrough pain (BTP).1,2 Cancer patients with BTP typically experience more depression and anxiety and report a
worse impact of pain on their quality of life compared
with cancer patients who do not have BTP.3 The current
treatment strategy for the management of patients with
moderate to severe chronic, persistent cancer pain is often
an around-the-clock (ATC) opioid regimen to control
persistent pain, with a short-acting, orally administered
opioid as supplemental (‘‘rescue’’) medication taken as
needed for the management of BTP.4-6 Current BTP
treatments are often not ideal for providing effective pain
relief.7 The reason for this may be a mismatch between
the temporal characteristics of BTP and the onset of analgesia associated with typical short-acting, orally administered opioids.3 Episodes of BTP often reach peak
intensity within a few minutes,3,8,9 whereas the onset of
analgesia of traditional short-acting oral opioids can take
up to 30 to 60 minutes.7,10,11
In contrast, fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) (Fentora;
Cephalon, Inc, Frazer, Pa) is designed to provide fast
onset of analgesia by enhancing fentanyl absorption across
the buccal mucosa.12 FBT is currently indicated only for
the treatment of BTP in patients with cancer who are already receiving and who are tolerant of opioid therapy for
their underlying persistent cancer pain.13 Patients considered to be tolerant are those who are receiving either at
least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 lg of
transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per
day, or an equivalent dose of another opioid for 1 week.
In 2 previous short-term, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies among opioid-tolerant
patients with cancer-related persistent pain and BTP,
analgesic activity with FBT was detected as early as 10
minutes14 and 15 minutes,13 respectively, after selfadministration. Patients who completed either of these 2
studies and continued to have BTP episodes that were
adequately controlled with FBT were offered the option
of continuing treatment in a long-term (12 months)
study to assess the ongoing safety and tolerability of FBT.
Thus, the current study served as a long-term, open-label
extension for patients from the 2 previous double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies. This study also enrolled new
2572

patients currently being managed with ATC opioids but
naive to FBT.
The objectives of the current study were to determine the long-term tolerability and safety of FBT as well
as the patient-assessed FBT medication performance, and
to assess the development of incremental tolerance in
opioid-tolerant cancer patients with cancer-related BTP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This open-label study was conducted at 47 centers in the
US between April 2004 and November 2006. The study
was originally designed for 12 months of maintenance.
An extension was added so that patients could continue in
the study through November 30, 2006, at which point
the study was terminated once FBT became commercially
available.
The study was conducted in accordance with good
clinical practice,15 and the protocol was approved by the
institutional review board at each center. All patients
provided written informed consent.

Patients
Opioid-tolerant men and women (aged 18 years) who
had pain associated with a histologically documented malignant solid tumor or hematologic malignancy and had a
life expectancy of 2 months were eligible to enroll.
Patients who were naive to FBT and patients who had
completed 1 of 2 previous randomized, controlled FBT
studies13,14 (rollover patients) were eligible. Inclusion criteria included the use of a fixed-dose ATC opioid regimen
(ie, morphine at a dose of 60-1000 mg/day, transdermal
fentanyl at a dose of 25-300 lg/hour, or the morphine
equivalent) for persistent cancer-related pain for 1 week
and the occurrence of an average of 1 to 4 episodes of BTP
per day that were treated with a previously identified dose
of FBT (rollover patients) or other supplemental opioids
(FBT-naive patients).
Exclusion criteria included sleep apnea or active
brain metastases with increased intracranial pressure,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal or hepatic
function test results outside prespecified limits, a recent
history of substance abuse or neurologic or psychiatric
impairment that might compromise data collection,
receipt of therapy 30 days before entering the study that

would alter pain or responses to analgesics (eg, nerve
blocks, anesthetic procedures), a primary source of BTP
not related to cancer or cancer treatment, and the use of
concomitant medications that might increase the risk
of opioid-related adverse events (AEs). Women were
excluded if they were pregnant or lactating, or were
unwilling to practice a reliable form of contraception
during the study.

Study Design
The study consisted of screening, titration, and maintenance phases (Fig. 1). New patients participated in a titration phase (21 days). All patients (both newly titrated
and rollover) entered the maintenance treatment phase of
12 months. At the screening visit, FBT-naive patients
underwent physical, laboratory, and neurologic examinations, including an examination of the oral mucosa and
measurements of vital signs. Rollover patients underwent
these procedures at the first maintenance visit. All patients
continued to take their ATC opioid regimens for persistent
pain throughout the titration and maintenance phases.
Adjustments to the ATC dosing regimen were allowed.
The successful dose of FBT was defined as the dose
during titration that adequately relieved BTP within 30
minutes without unacceptable AEs for 2 successive episodes of BTP (occurring 4 hours apart). The titration
procedure for FBT has been published elsewhere.13,14
Briefly, all patients received a single tablet of FBT as a test
dose. If the FBT dose was tolerated, then the patient
Cancer

entered the titration phase. Patients who had not been
receiving the earlier formulation of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) before study entry received a test
dose of FBT of 100 lg. Patients who had been receiving
OTFC to manage BTP received a protocol-defined FBT
dose based on their prestudy OTFC dose: those who were
previously being treated with OTFC at a dose of 600 lg
were administered a test dose of FBT of 100 lg, and those
previously receiving either 800 lg, 1200 lg, or 1600 lg
of OTFC were given a test dose of FBT of 200 lg, 400
lg, or 600 lg, respectively. During titration, patients selfadministered FBT to treat a BTP episode. A single tablet
was placed between the upper gum and cheek, above a
molar tooth, and allowed to dissolve. After taking FBT for
a BTP episode, patients were required to wait 4 hours
before taking FBT again. However, if pain relief was not
adequate by 30 minutes, patients could take their standard
supplemental medications. By taking increasingly higher
doses of FBT as necessary for successive episodes of BTP,
patients identified a successful FBT dose (100 lg, 200 lg,
400 lg, 600 lg, or 800 lg) for the treatment of BTP during the maintenance phase. Patients who did not obtain
satisfactory relief of BTP at the highest FBT dose (800
lg) were discontinued from the study.
Patients who identified a successful FBT dose during titration were eligible to enter maintenance treatment.
During maintenance, if a patient did not obtain adequate
pain relief within 30 minutes after self-administration of
FBT, he or she could take a second tablet. If a patient
required more than a single tablet of FBT for 2 of 3 BTP

episodes per day, the investigators had the option of
increasing the dose. If the patient was already receiving
the highest dose (800 lg), he or she was discontinued
from the study. The study drug could be used for a maximum of 6 BTP episodes on any given day and a maximum
of 8 tablets could be used on any given day.

Assessments
Before the maintenance phases, safety for new patients
was monitored by physical and neurologic examinations
and clinical laboratory tests performed at screening and at
the end of titration, as well as by assessments of vital signs
and examinations of the oral mucosa at screening and at
the initiation and end of titration. All AEs either observed
by the investigators or reported by the patients were
reviewed at the end of titration. Rollover patients underwent physical and neurologic examinations, vital sign
measurements, and clinical laboratory tests at the end of
their previous study, and these findings served as data for
Visit 1 (initiation of maintenance) of the current study.
During maintenance treatment, vital signs were
measured and AEs reviewed monthly. Clinical laboratory
tests and examination of the oral mucosa were performed
at least every 3 months. Neurologic and physical examinations were performed at least every 3 months during the
first 12 months of the study and at least every 6 months
thereafter. All assessments were repeated at each patient’s
final visit.
Patients recorded in a diary the number of BTP episodes they had each day and the number of tablets of FBT
taken per day. Patients rated the effectiveness of FBT in
alleviating BTP by completing a Global Medication Performance assessment on a daily basis, using a 5-point scale
(0 indicates poor, 1 indicates fair, 2 indicates good, 3 indicates very good, and 4 indicates excellent). Patients also
completed a 7-item study medication questionnaire, the
Patient Assessment of Medication, before and 1 month after the start of the maintenance phase. This questionnaire
was an exploratory measure, added to the protocol after
the study had started; thus, only 25% of patients completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire asked patients
to compare FBT with their previous supplemental medications, through the following questions: 1) which medication would you prefer to use when treating your BTP?
2) which medication had a faster onset of relief? 3) which
2574

medication was easier to administer? and 4) which medication was more convenient to use? The questionnaire
also asked patients to rate FBT as excellent, good, fair, or
poor in relation to onset of action, ease of administration,
and convenience of use.
Investigators reviewed patient diaries at each study
visit to assess the need for dose adjustments for either FBT
or ATC opioids. Dose increases and decreases were made
at the discretion of the investigator. Specifically, investigators considered the number of BTP episodes per day, the
need for more than a single tablet of FBT for BTP episodes, and Global Medication Performance scores, as well
as the patient’s reports of AEs and medication use, including the use of additional supplemental medication for
BTP. Investigators selected the reason for any dose adjustments every month from a list of options: because of the
development of incremental tolerance, to rebalance concomitant medication, because of disease progression or
regression, because of a successful alternative therapy,
because of the development of a safety concern or intolerability, or other reason.

Statistical Analysis
The sample size for this study was based on clinical rather
than statistical considerations. It was planned that up to
100 patients who successfully completed 1 of 2 previous
short-term studies would continue in this study. Patients
who received a test dose of FBT for titration constituted
the titration safety population. Patients who received 1
dose of FBT during maintenance (which included the
extension) composed the maintenance safety population.
Patients who received 1 dose of FBT during any phase
of the study constituted the overall safety population.
This was an open-label study; observed data were summarized using descriptive statistics, and missing data were
not imputed.

RESULTS
Patient Disposition
All 232 patients enrolled in the study constituted the overall safety population because they received 1 dose of
FBT. A total of 110 patients were FBT-naive and therefore entered titration. In addition, 2 rollover patients

entered titration for repeat titration of their FBT dose
because their previous dose was not effective (Fig. 2).
These 112 patients received the test dose of FBT and constituted the titration safety population. Of these 112
patients, 79 (71%) identified a successful dose, and 77
(69%) entered the maintenance phase; 35 (31%) discontinued during titration, including 2 patients who found a
successful dose but discontinued the study. The primary
reasons for discontinuation during titration included
withdrawal of consent (11 patients) and lack of efficacy
(10 patients).
The 120 rollover patients (not including the 2 rollover patients who retitrated their FBT dose) along with
77 newly titrated patients entered maintenance and
received 1 dose of FBT. This population of 197 patients
(85% of 232 patients) constituted the maintenance safety
analysis population (Fig. 2). Forty-two patients (18% of
232 patients) remained in maintenance treatment for
approximately 12 months, and 155 (67%) patients discontinued the study during that period (Fig. 2), most frequently because of AEs (n ¼ 70 patients), the majority of
Cancer

which were unrelated to study drug. Only 3 (1%) patients
were discontinued because of lack of efficacy (Fig. 2).

Patient Demographics and Pain
Characteristics
Baseline demographics for the overall safety population,
presented in Table 1, were found to be similar in the titration safety and maintenance safety populations. The
pathophysiology of BTP for the overall safety population
was considered to be primarily nociceptive in 107 (46%)
patients, primarily neuropathic in 42 (18%) patients, and
mixed (approximately 50% neuropathic/50% nociceptive) in 83 (36%) patients. Commonly used ATC and
supplemental medications of patients before entry into
the study are presented in Table 2. All 232 patients were
receiving concomitant analgesic agents because opioid
tolerance was required for study entry. A total of 223
patients (96%) were receiving medications other than
analgesics; 111 (48%) were receiving antineoplastic and/
or immunomodulating agents.

Safety Analyses
A summary of AEs is presented in Table 4. AEs occurred
at higher rates during the maintenance compared with the
titration phase. However, the incidence of AEs considered
by the investigators to be related to FBT was higher in the
titration phase (46% titration vs 38% maintenance). The
most common AEs (10%) in the titration safety population were dizziness (26%), nausea (24%), somnolence
(13%), and headache (10%). The most common AEs
(15%) in the maintenance population were nausea
(32%), vomiting (24%), fatigue (18%), constipation
(15%), peripheral edema (15%), and anemia (15%). The
most common AEs (10%) considered to be related to
treatment by the investigators during maintenance treatment were nausea (10%), constipation (8%), dizziness
(6%), and somnolence (6%).
2576

At least 1 application-site AE occurred in 15 (6%)
patients in the overall study. The most common application site AEs in the titration safety population were pain
(5 patients), irritation (3 patients), and paresthesia (3
patients). The most common application site AEs in the
maintenance population were pain (4 patients), ulcer (4
patients), and irritation (2 patients). Four patients overall
withdrew from the study because of application site AEs.
All application site AEs were considered by the investigators to be mild or moderate in severity and treatment
related.
AEs leading to withdrawal were reported for 77
patients (33%): 6 during titration and 71 during maintenance treatment. Of the 6 patients discontinued during
titration, 2 were due to nausea. The most common AEs

y A total of 42 patients were considered to have completed this study. However, exposure for 8 of these patients was <360 days, which was used to
calculate exposure of 12 months, and they are not counted in this table.
In addition, 2 of the patients who completed 12 months of treatment were

leading to discontinuation during maintenance treatment
were related to the patients’ underlying disease; neoplasms
(benign, malignant, and unspecified) accounted for the
withdrawal of 53 patients.
All serious AEs were considered to be related to
patients’ underlying conditions except for 1 serious AE of
drug withdrawal syndrome, which was deemed by the investigator to be related to study drug treatment. No cases
of respiratory depression were considered by the investigators to be related to study drug administration. No
incidences of overdose were reported.
Sixty patients died after enrollment in the study; all
deaths were attributable to progression of cancer or pathology of underlying disease. Of these 60 patients, 2 died
as a result of AEs that developed during the titration phase
(1 due to disease progression and 1 due to cerebral hemorrhage), and 58 died of AEs that developed during or after
the maintenance phase. Included in the 60 deaths were 4
that were attributable in part to serious AEs that developed >30 days after the discontinuation of FBT.
Three patients had a history of mucositis before
entering the study, and 5 patients developed mucositis
during the study (4 mild cases and 1 moderate case). The
investigators considered these developments to be unrelated to FBT administration. Two of these patients subsequently withdrew from the study, for reasons unrelated to
mucositis.

* Successful fentanyl buccal tablet doses were identified either during the titration phase (in treatment-naive patients) or
during the previous studies (rollover patients). Shaded areas indicate that the final dose was the same as the initial dose
in a total of 136 patients (69%) (including any patients who had dose changes during the study and were changed back
to their initial dose).

Medication after 1 month of maintenance. Patients
favored FBT compared with their previous BTP medication in terms of overall preference (88% FBT vs 12% previous BTP medication; n ¼ 81), time to onset of pain
relief (95% vs 5%; n ¼ 81), ease of administration (66%
vs 34%; n ¼ 82), and convenience of use (68% vs 32%; n
¼ 82). The majority of patients rated FBT as either excellent or good for onset of action (93%; n ¼ 82), convenience of use (82%; n ¼ 82), and ease of administration
(80%; n ¼ 82).
On the Global Medication Performance questionnaire, on average patients rated FBT between good and
very good throughout maintenance. The mean (SD)
Global Medication Performance was 2.4 (0.9) at the initiation of maintenance (n ¼ 187) and 2.3 (0.8) at endpoint (n ¼ 188). Scores were relatively stable for
patients who stayed in the study until its end (Global
Medication Performance rating at 18 months was 2.1
[0.6]; n ¼ 10).
The majority of patients did not have dose changes
over time; the final dose of FBT at the last study visit was
the same as the initial successful dose for 136 of 197
(69%) patients (including 3 patients who had dose
changes during the study and eventually changed back to
the initial dose) (Table 5). Compared with the initial
dose, the final dose was higher for 54 patients and lower
for 7 patients.

DISCUSSION
FBT was generally well tolerated and had a favorable
safety profile during the long-term treatment of BTP in
2578

opioid-tolerant patients with chronic persistent cancer
pain. The most frequently reported AEs were of the type
and severity expected in patients being treated with ATC
opioids (ie, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and
constipation).6,16 Overall, the incidence of AEs was
higher than in short-term studies of FBT in patients with
cancer and BTP,13,14 as would be expected based on the
extended duration of the current study.
A successful FBT dose was identified by 71% of
patients during titration, a percentage similar to the rates
observed in previous studies of FBT in patients with
cancer and BTP.13,14 Treatment with FBT demonstrated
control of BTP for 12 months. The majority of patients
had a final dose that was the same as their initial successful
dose, suggesting there was no decline in analgesic efficacy
over time in most patients. This is supported by the observation that only 3 (1%) patients discontinued the study
because of the lack of efficacy of FBT during the maintenance phase.
The current study was not intended as a rigorous examination of the development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of FBT over time. An increase from an initially
successful dose of FBT may indicate cancer progression
and an increase in the severity of cancer pain and cancerrelated BTP that may ensue. Indeed, it is generally
accepted that increasing pain due to disease progression is
the primary reason for dose escalation in patients with
cancer and BTP.16 An increase in FBT dose could also
reflect a discrepancy between the patient’s expectation of
pain relief and the degree of relief actually achieved, and/
or an increase in the amount or level of patient daily activity because of effective BTP management. Clinical

FBT: Long-term Safety/Weinstein et al

experience has shown that patients with functional goals
may increase their activity until the maximum tolerable
pain level is reached.
The Global Medication Performance scores, which
were consistent with those in previous studies,13,14 indicated that patients who remained in the study continued
to be satisfied over time with the effectiveness of FBT.
Patients clearly preferred FBT to previous BTP medications, as indicated by Patient Assessment of Medication
scores, which were also consistent with those noted in previous short-term studies of FBT in a similar patient
population.13,14
The potential limitations of this study are its openlabel study design with no active comparator and the large
attrition rate, which limited the ability to draw conclusions. However, the rate of attrition is typically unavoidable in a population with progressive disease, such as the
one in this study.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, the current study is the first to follow a
large patient population with chronic cancer pain for 12
months in the evaluation of FBT for the management of
BTP. FBT was generally well tolerated and had a favorable
safety profile. Unexpected AEs did not occur, thus confirming and extending the findings of previous short-term
studies. Response to FBT was maintained over the period
12 months.
