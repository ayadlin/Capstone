ABSTRACT
The interconnected network of pathways downstream of the TGFβ, WNT and EGFfamilies of receptor ligands play an important role in colorectal cancer pathogenesis.
We studied and implemented dynamic simulations of multiple downstream
pathways and described the section of the signaling network considered as a Molecular
Interaction Map (MIM). Our simulations used Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs),
which involved 447 reactants and their interactions.
Starting from an initial “physiologic condition”, the model can be adapted to
simulate individual pathologic cancer conditions implementing alterations/mutations
in relevant onco-proteins. We verified some salient model predictions using the
mutated colorectal cancer lines HCT116 and HT29. We measured the amount of
MYC and CCND1 mRNAs and AKT and ERK phosphorylated proteins, in response
to individual or combination onco-protein inhibitor treatments. Experimental and
simulation results were well correlated. Recent independently published results were
also predicted by our model.
Even in the presence of an approximate and incomplete signaling network
information, a predictive dynamic modeling seems already possible. An important long
term road seems to be open and can be pursued further, by incremental steps, toward
even larger and better parameterized MIMs. Personalized treatment strategies with
rational associations of signaling-proteins inhibitors, could become a realistic goal.

INTRODUCTION

per individual CRC tumor. Additional somatically
inheritable driver alterations were not included. In the
COSMIC release of June 2nd 2014 [2], the curators have
estimated that an individual cancer can be caused by 5
-10 driver mutations (not identical in different tumors),
against a background of more than 10,000 passenger
mutations per tumor. Notice that in the cancer lines used

Colorectal cancer (CRC) can be characterized
according to the genomic landscapes of individual CRC
patients [1]. Driver mutations can vary to some extent in
different CRCs. B. Vogelstein et al. have recently reported
[1] a model featuring around 2-5 major driver mutations

for our experimental verifications the most frequent driver
and gate-keeper mutations / alterations are indeed present
(in an order of a decreasing frequency of occurrence in
CRC: TP53; APC; KRAS; PTEN; SMAD4; PIK3CA;
BRAF; CDH1). From a general perspective, we will
encounter most often the most frequent driver mutations/
alterations, however from the perspective of the individual
tumor of a specific patient, we could have had a Darwinian
evolution to cancer, through a constellation of (at least in
part) much less frequent driver mutations/alterations. In a
modern framework of personalized Systems Oncology, to
know more about these individual oncogene constellations
is becoming of increasing relevance. An uncommon
mutation / somatically inheritable alteration could make
a specific patient differently sensitive or resistant to a
specific inhibitor.
A more complete analysis requires the assessment
not only of DNA-mutations but also alterations in gene
copy number, expression of fusion genes, direct or indirect
silencing of repressor genes, epigenetic modifications
and over-expression of dominant onco-genes [3-5]. At
a clinical level, the sub-clonal heterogeneity present
in a given tumor [6] as well as in its metastases is also
important, according to the principle of Darwinian
evolution of an individual tumor over time.
We are convinced that the role of normal and altered
signaling-proteins cannot be understood in isolation, as a
simple summation of multiple mutations/alterations. These
signaling-proteins have to be integrated within pathways
and network-regions [7, 8], along which biochemical
signals are propagated. To reconstruct our network subregion we implemented a MIM diagram and MIM notation
rules. “A MIM is a diagram convention that is capable of
unambiguous representation of networks containing multiprotein complexes, protein modifications, and enzymes
that are substrates of other enzymes. This graphical
representation makes it possible to view all of the many
interactions in which a given molecule may be involved,
and it can portray competing interactions, which are
common in bio-regulatory networks” [9-12].
Integration of such large and disparate data into
functional dynamic networks, capable of suggesting
personalized treatment strategies, is best achieved by
computational mathematical modeling.
In our work of MIM reconstruction and dynamic
mathematic modeling at the biochemical interactions
level, we did not consider a different scale of modeling,
involving the dynamics of cell differentiation and upward
movement in a colon crypt [13]. Notice however that
some of the onco-proteins altered/mutated in the pathways
covered by the MIM are already altered/mutated in Colon
Cancer Stem Cells (CCSC) at the crypt bottom [14, 15],
where molecular initial preneoplastic lesions can be passed
on to daughter cells as CCSC for long times.
Similar networks are also operative in breast cancer
[16], in NSCLC [17] and in many other tumors. Driverwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutations frequencies, and probably some signalingprotein concentrations, can differ significantly in
different cancer types. Although these differences must
be accounted for, they are not an absolute impediment to
adapting the model to other cancer types.
Within current knowledge and technology limits,
it is still impossible to reconstruct all pathways involved
in the malignant transformation of a given cancer cell.
However, some sub-regions of the signaling-network are
known to be more frequently mutated/altered in specific
cancers. As such, the signaling-proteins of these subregions have been intensively investigated and several
signaling-protein inhibitors have been developed (initially
for preclinical studies, but also directed toward present
and future clinical studies).
To generate a model of signaling mechanisms,
we focused on a functionally relevant sub-region of the
cell’s signaling network (G0-G1 cell cycle transition). We
modeled a network sub-region, downstream of the TGFβ,
WNT and EGF pathways (Fig. 1). Driver-gatekeepermutations affecting the pathways reconstructed in our
MIM are quite frequent in CRC (but not exclusively in
CRC). They are included in the Cancer Gene Census [2,
18].
Our simulations used Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODEs) involving 447 reactants (basic
species, modified species, complexes and inhibitors),
348 reversible reactions and 174 catalytic reactions (for
a total of 348•2 + 174 = 870 reactions). For dynamic
mathematical simulations, efficient software are available
[19-21] for achieving numerical solutions via ODEs of
the temporal evolution of large networks of biochemical
interactions, a phenomenon which conceptually is at
the basis of cell life itself. A version of our Molecular
Interaction Map (MIM) and associated modeling was
generated in accordance with the mutational background
of two CRC lines (HCT116 and HT29) and thus could
predict the specific response of each line to inhibitor
perturbations.
These cell lines provide a good representation of
two major complementary types of CRC, in terms of
accuracy of DNA replication. A strong association with
Chromosomal Instability (CIN) was described for sporadic
cancers, giving rise to aneuploidy. In terms of base level
fidelity of DNA replication, heritable cancers were often
characterized by the presence of the Microsatellites
Instability (MIN) [22]. The two cancer cell lines used in
our study represent distinct categories: HT29 represents
the sporadic cancers group, being derived from a colon
carcinoma without microsatellite instability, but featuring
aneuploidy with a DI (DNA Index) ≈ 1.5 (CIN+, MIN−),
while HCT116 is derived from a colon carcinoma with a
high microsatellites instability level, which did not present
aneuploidy using FCM-DNA ploidy analysis (CIN−,
MIN+) [23].
Pathways and network sub-regions were delimited
5042

on an empirical fuzzy logic basis. They are incomplete
reconstructions along an ongoing incremental process of
network growth and improved refinement.
Moreover, pathways are not discrete linear modules,
but intertwined parts of larger robust networks, with
built-in functional feedbacks. Even if incomplete, our
reconstructed and modeled network sub-region seemed
sufficiently coherent in regulating (at least in part) the
transcription of two key oncogenes, considered extremely
relevant in the G0 – G1 cell cycle transition and S phase
entry, MYC (c-myc) and CCND1 (cyclin D1).
In addition to MYC and CCND1 mRNAs, we
experimentally validated the behavior of ppERK (Thr202/
Tyr204)/total ERK ratio and pAKT (Ser473)/total AKT
ratio proteins, which lay upstream of the mRNA response.
We submitted our extensively pre-trained model to a
posteriori experimental verifications, a strategy already
used in modeling smaller signaling-network regions.
In previous studies, ODEs models of the EGFR/ErbB
signaling cascade were developed [24-28]. Dynamic
models of signaling pathways such as TGF-β [29-31],
IGFR [26, 32], Wnt [33, 34], were also developed.
Repository of computational models of biological
processes such as Biomodels and Java Web Simulations
(JWS) [35, 36] are available on line. Statistical analyses of
the degree of correlation and predictivity of these models
were not reported.
We developed a MIM / dynamic model which is
probably the largest ever reconstructed and modeled.
We intertwined the cross-talks of three relevant cancer
pathways in CRC (TGFβ, WNT and EGF pathways),
instead of reconstructing them separately. Our model
can be tailored to the individual mutational background
of an individual tumor or cancer cell line, and is already
sufficiently capable of predicting the response of CRC
cells to different inhibitor treatments.
We are well aware that in order to increase
predictive capabilities we have to move in the direction
of even larger MIMs + dynamic models of biochemical
interactions / catalytic reactions, improving and extending
the parameterization of the model, plus looking at larger
numbers of molecular and phenotypic outputs.
Our present work suggests that advancement in this
direction is technically feasible.
Which “selective” inhibitor drugs have been
already tried at a clinical level in CRC? Cetuximab and
Panitumumab (anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies) are
currently used in clinical practice for the treatment of
metastatic forms of colorectal cancer, in the absence of
a downstream KRAS mutation conferring resistance
[37-39], either as single agents or in combination with
traditional cytotoxic anticancer agents. Bevacizumab,
a monoclonal antibody directed against the Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which promotes
neo-angiogenesis, was also clinically employed [40, 41].
Regorafenib, an inhibitor of several kinases (uncertain
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

specificity) has already been studied in a phase III trial
[42], where it demonstrated some activity. The survival
gains (PFS, OS) reported in these studies [40-42] on
metastatic CRC and referred to patients genetically/
epigenetically not deeply characterized, were in general
less than four months, in comparison with other types
of previous chemotherapic treatments or a placebo.
Sometimes statistically significant results can depend from
the size of the study. They cannot be considered by default
clinically relevant.
MEK inhibitors probably more potent than CI1040
(for instance Selumetinib - AZD6244), in association with
Afatinib (BIBW2992 - an ERBB2 irreversible inhibitor),
can synergize in KRAS-mutant lung and colon cancers
[43]. In this last case, clinical studies have just started.
In a phase II study, Everolimus (an mTOR inhibitor)
was well tolerated but did not confer meaningful
efficacy in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer [44]. Targeted sequencing in bladder
cancers, revealed that TSC1 mutations are correlated
with Everolimus sensitivity [45]. A mutated TSC1
acts as an inactive GTPase toward Rheb, which in turn
phosphorylates / activates mTORC1. Perhaps, a factor
of caution in the usage of Everolimus, is its potent
immunosuppressant activity.
The range of new-generation agents directed
against specific signaling-proteins, currently evaluated
in preclinical studies, is much wider than the number of
drugs already approved for clinical use. At the preclinical
level, several agents are being investigated whose targets
are aberrantly activated in CRC, including PI3K or
AKT inhibitors (along the PI3K pathway) and MDM2
inhibitors (in the TP53 pathway). In addition, new agents
are emerging, such as Tankyrase inhibitors [46], which,
by inhibiting Axin degradation, increase its intracellular
concentration, ultimately promoting β-Catenin degradation
and Wnt signaling inhibition.

RESULTS
Construction of a CRC Molecular Interaction
Map (MIM) focused on the G0 - G1 transition
The MIMs reconstructed and used in our simulations
are shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1.3, for
HCT116 and HT29 cancer lines, respectively. To our
knowledge this network of CRC signaling (at the scale
level of biochemical interactions) is probably the largest
ever reconstructed and modeled.
The detailed syntactic rules for drawing our
MIM are described in [9-12], and briefly summarized
in panel B of Fig. 1. Our MIMs are accompanied by an

different molecular alterations present in different CRC
lines or tumors.
It is a work in progress, but our model could already
reasonably predict, substantially all the biochemical
responses to inhibitor treatments that we have tested.
Supplementary Material 5.1 and 5.2 shows
examples of the model complexity, including positive
and negative feedbacks, going from a physiologic model
to the introduction of different mutations/alterations and
inhibitors.

Model construction
The model combines the network MIM (Fig.
1 and Supplementary Fig. 1.3) with a mathematical
model of the MIM’s underlying molecular interactions
(Supplementary 2.1 Reactions List) and a reconstruction
of the transcription region controlling the expression of
c-MYC and CCND1 mRNAs (Fig. 2 and Derivation of
a Transcription Rate Function for MYC and CCND1 in
Methods section).
Our model can be easily modified to incorporate

Experimental verification of the model
Modeling this network sub-region required a series
of approximations, especially in the reconstruction of a
MIM, and in parameterization of concentrations and
reaction rates. It would have been difficult to determine a
priori if a model, no matter how carefully trained to fit the

current literature, was overwhelmed by the accumulated
noise of all the inevitable approximations, or whether it
already possessed predictive capabilities, which can be
further improved in a stepwise fashion. In fact this was a
crucial question our work was trying to answer.
At the core of our work, training consisted in a more
than three-year long patient continuous patchwork effort,
a work of continuous parameter readjustments, aimed at
an integrated fitting of our model with the results of about
one hundred strictly pertinent molecular reductionist-type
experimental papers, published in reputable (high impact)
journals.
We feel that our very long and patient empirical
“sewing together patchwork”, finalized to a proper tuning
of the model during the training phase, was a process
somehow describable as a parallel “in silico evolution”,
where deficiencies at the level of network components
and parameters inputs have been somehow balanced. Let
just say here that this intriguing issue could also stimulate
more basic “logic” analyses about network properties.
After the training phase of our model, we submitted
the model to a posteriori experimental verifications, to

answer the basic question whether the presently available
incomplete information was adequate or inadequate to
build a predictive model.
If the level of information was sufficiently
adequate, then we are already on a correct road, requiring
only possible and achievable gradual incremental
improvements, to produce models with increasing clinical
utility.
We verified model predictions at both (networkpertinent) oncogene mRNA levels and protein
phosphorylation levels, in response to inhibitor treatments,
in HCT116 and HT29 cell lines, respectively.

Accounting for mRNA stability in the model
We investigated directly c-myc and CCND1
mRNAs stability. Complex findings had been reported
in the literature, concerning effects of MEK inhibition
on CCND1 regulation, for instance as reviewed by Alao
[47]. At a protein level, MEK inhibition in HCT116 cells
extended the half-life of CCND1 protein by abolishing

T286 phosphorylation [48], while in MCF7 cells a longer
inhibition of MEK decreased CCND1 protein levels [49].
Our experiments, performed at a mRNA level, illuminated

a different dimension. MEK inhibition destabilizes
CCND1 mRNA, resulting in reduced protein levels
in the longer term. Indeed, we also treated MCF7 cells
with CI1040 and found a similar reduction in CCND1
mRNA levels (data not shown), as observed in our CRC
cell lines. A CCND1 mRNA inhibition and an extended
CCND1 protein half-life, could be part of dual converseregulatory buffering mechanisms in signaling pathways,
as we recently identified a similar regulation of MYCN
by GSK3 [49].
In this work we were however primarily interested
in c-myc and CCND1 mRNAs levels.
During MIM experimental validation we observed
a substantial difference in the response time between
MYC and CCND1 mRNA to MEK inhibition (CI1040),
particularly for early time points (4h and earlier). We
examined the stability of each genes’ mRNA using also the
pan-transcriptional inhibitor Act D (Fig. 3). We determined
the degradation rate of pre-existing mRNAs after blocking
de novo transcription. While HCT116 cells have higher
levels of both MYC and CCND1 mRNAs than HT29 cells
(Fig. 3A), mRNAs stability is similar across both cell lines
(Fig. 3B). However, MYC and CCND1 mRNAs have a
different stability. MYC is highly unstable, with a halflife shorter than 2h, while CCND1 mRNA is substantially
stable, being unaffected even after 6h (Fig. 3B). We
incorporated into the mathematical model the differing
stabilities of the two mRNA species.
Global MYC mRNA is expected to change quickly
in response to an upstream inhibitor, due to rapid turnover.
Conversely, as an a priori expectation, even after a
6h-treatment with an upstream inhibitor, we would expect
to see all of the pre-existing CCND1 mRNA still present,
obscuring any inhibitor-induced changes to transcription.
It is however possible for an upstream inhibitor to
modulate an indirect pathway capable of affecting the
baseline CCND1 mRNA stability.
This behavior is probably linked to the regulation
of a specific miRNA, which is capable to influence the
stability of CCND1 degradation. In the literature there
are references describing as miRNA-34a transcription is
repressed by c-Myc protein [50]. In turn miRNA-34a is
capable of targeting CCND1 mRNA for degradation [51],
via an Ago complex formation [52].
When CI1040 represses c-myc mRNA transcription
by the inhibition of the KRAS pathway, c-myc mRNA and
protein levels rapidly decrease, due to the high degradation
rates of both molecules (our Fig. 3B and [53, 54] for c-myc
mRNA, and [55] for c-Myc protein). A rapidly reduced
c-Myc protein level leads to a decreased repression of
miRNA-34a expression. As a consequence, more CCND1
mRNA will be degraded. After incubation with CI1040 for
4 h (Fig. 3) and 4-8 h (Fig. 6 and 7), we indeed observed
progressively decreasing levels of CCND1 mRNA.

MEK inhibition changes CCND1 mRNA stability

CCND1 mRNA levels as these two genes are considered
extremely relevant in the G0 – G1 cell cycle transition and
S phase entry, being key factors for tumor development,
growth and progression. The mRNA level of these
oncogenes provides a proxy for the cellular response.
The model was able to predict the changes to MYC and
CCND1 mRNAs levels. For all inhibitory treatments, the
trends toward strong or weak inhibitions were correctly
predicted.

MEK inhibition altered the stability of pre-existing
(pre-CI1040 incubation) CCND1 mRNAs through the
transcriptional regulation of an intermediary gene. We
revealed this by a combination treatment in HT29 cells
(Fig. 3C). Consistent with the earlier experiments, Act D
did not alter CCND1 mRNA levels while CI1040 reduced
them. However, dual treatment with CI1040 and Act D
did not alter CCND1 levels. Act D rescued the CI1040
induced CCND1 degradation. Therefore, the CCND1
mRNA destabilization induced by MEK inhibition must
be achieved through the transcriptional regulation of an
intermediary gene (miRNA or RNA binding protein).
We implemented in our model this novel
modification of CCND1 mRNA stability in the presence
of the CI1040 MEK inhibitor (Supplementary Table 2.1,
reaction # 868). 	

Experimental verification of the model; results
related to phospho-proteins experiments
To compare simulated and experimental data,
we performed inhibitor treatments using five different
inhibitors and some of their combinations, both in silico
and in vitro, measuring the levels of pp-ERK (Thr202/
Tyr204) and pAKT (Ser473) (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). Inhibitors
were chosen to produce perturbations in each of the
main model pathways. Only inhibitors which acted at or
downstream of mutated genes were considered. Model
predictions and experimental results were statistically
correlated for both lines, perhaps slightly more closely for
HCT116 cells (see section “Statistical Analyses”).
In both Fig. 5 (ERKPP and AKTP proteins
phosphorylation) and Fig. 7 (c-MYC and CCND1 mRNAs
levels) we drew a 45° diagonal line between the X axis
(simulated data) and the Y axis (experimental data),
reflecting a theoretic 1:1 match. Both in the case of strong
inhibitions and weak or absent inhibitions, simulated and
experimental data tended to go together well.
ERKPP shows only two levels because we tested
only one concentration of CI1040 MEK inhibitor (80%
of inhibition), AKTP shows different levels because we
tested two different concentrations of Perifosine AKT
inhibitor (40% and 70% of inhibition) (Fig. 4).

regulation experiments

performed inhibitor treatments (single and combination

and CCND1 mRNA levels and comparing simulated and

Interpretation of our Results as suggested by a
Statistical Analysis

With reference to Fig.7, the only concentration of
MEK inhibitor tested (80% of inhibition), seems to have
had a more relevant effect on mRNAs transcription than
any other inhibitor treatment.
Our model captures only major and explicitly
described variations induced by treatments, rather
than smaller variations, probably related to additional
complexities of the network not represented in our MIM.
Considering the usual bench experimental variability,
typical of individual data seen in biological replicates of
wet experiments, we should expect much more variability
in wet experiments (results parallel to the Y axis), than in
the virtual predictions of the model (parallel to the X axis),
where we make only one prediction for each experimental
condition. This is precisely what we observed in Fig. 5
and in Fig. 7.

Statistical analysis was implemented by means
of the R statistical programming framework and the
gdata, pspearman and RVAideMemoire libraries [56].
Associations were assessed through non parametric
analysis with the Spearman’s correlation coefficient.
Supplementary Material 6 provides raw data in
four different Tables (two for each cell line): one Table
for ERK and AKT proteins, one Table for c-MYC and
CCND1 mRNA expression.
The data were then log-transformed to be analyzed
with linear regression and the explained variation measure
R^2 was provided to assess the extent of experimental
variability accounted by the simulation modeling approach
(see Table 1 and Table 2).

between our predictions through our model simulations
and the corresponding experimental results. The
Spearman’s rho coefficient was computed for the HTC116
and HT29 cell lines for two protein endpoints and two
mRNAs.
With reference to Table 2, there is no evidence of
non normality in y values (Fig. 4, 5, 6 and 7), and we are
not actually performing statistical inference linked to the
normality assumption. Therefore, R^2 seems a suitable
measure of explained variation in the present context.
R^2 represents the fraction of the Y variable that the
X variable is capable to predict [57]. It can also provide a
complementary indication of goodness of fit.
The two cancer lines HCT116 and HT29 carry rather
distinct mutations and alterations (Section Methods). If
we look at Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1.3, the two
endpoints ERKPP and AKTP look as two rather distinct
pathways, with an altered behavior dependent from distinct
mutations. If we look at Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, it seems evident
that the two mRNAs add an additional layer of complex
regulation, downstream of activators or repressors bound
to the transcription factor binding sites (TFBS).
As a consequence, the different parameters
measured can be considered at least partially independent,
even if “physically” not completely independent [58].

We found a significant statistical correlation in all cases
examined. If we have a partial independence for each case
examined, an “always positive outcome” will tend to be
much more significant than each individual correlation.
Our statistical analysis has tried not to convey a
misleading message of our stage of MIM reconstruction,
parameterization, and mathematical modeling, as if it was
already close to a practically working instrument.
What we have shown instead, is that the multiple
(and inevitable at this stage) deficiencies in input, are
definitely not generating a noise obscuring a clear
connection between model and experiments.
The very important message (reinforced by
statistical analysis) is that an incremental path is now open,
justifying more long term future cooperative efforts in the
directions of building larger MIMs, supported by more
input parameters at the level of molecular concentrations
and reaction rates.
In our opinion, our present model is already
intriguingly quite suggestive and encouraging, but we
work toward future more advanced models, as operative
instruments for a rationalization of the treatment of
individual cancer patients, using associations of inhibitors
of specifically altered pathways in a given specific cancer
of a specific patient.

Our model applied to independently published
results

like), could achieve important incremental advances,
culminating in a potentially useful new tool for clinical
oncology, tailored toward predicting in individual patients
the effectiveness of associations-combinations of selective
inhibitors of distinctly altered pathways. Tentatively, we
would expect that this goal could be achieved in three five years.
When a signaling-protein is mutated/altered in an
appropriate way, it can confer auto-activation, switching
on the downstream part of a given pathway independently
of the upstream condition. This potential for an irreversible
pathway activation, likely drives the selection of an
oncogenic mutation during the evolutionary carcinogenetic
process (including the mutations/alterations incorporated
into our model). A good therapeutic strategy could be to
inhibit two or three different pathways simultaneously,
but only those pathways altered by driver mutations and
implying potential forms of addiction to the mutations/
alterations considered [60].
As a first approximation, we should inhibit each
altered pathway with drugs acting at or below the
pathway-mutation/alteration.
Complementary to the strategy we propose will
have to be a more widespread generation of pertinent
personalized patient data, for instance through new
generation sequencing approaches applied to a routine
investigation of the most frequent driver mutations and
somatically inheritable alterations, reported for a given
tumor type [2].
We have moved in the direction of an important
enlargement and progressive improvement of previous
modelings of biochemical interactions [24-27, 61-63].
In perspective, for the specific cancer of a given patient,
our MIM and its linked mathematical model, aims at a
translation of a restricted number of relevant mutation/
alteration patient data + selected inhibitor combinations,
to clinically actionable information.
In our opinion, the results reported here prove the
concept of using mathematical models to better understand
the intricacies of biological signaling-networks and
treatment responses. Most importantly, our work suggests
the feasibility of this approach and the great opportunities
offered by continued future incremental advances.
Progressively/incrementally amending a model with novel
information, should be a working and winning strategy
for improving the predictive power of models of this
kind. We have in mind not only new externally published
information: a strong consortium-like cooperation could
become capable of acquiring directly a much larger set
of required experimental parameters (both in terms of
molecular concentrations and reaction rates).
It was impossible to assess a priori the predictive
value of our model. More than obviously it could not be
a definitive and complete reconstruction of a network
region, despite being based on a rather large number of
directly pertinent publications (about one hundred). The

The predictions of our model were tested against
preclinical results obtained by independent investigators,
in DiFi, LIM1215, HCA-46 and OXCO-2 CRC lines,
before and after induction of panErb resistance through
a subsequent KRAS mutation. Well after our model
finalization (training, + mRNA stability adjustments),
and our own experimental verifications, in a very recent
paper by Misale et al. [59], these authors demonstrated
that, in CRC lines that had become resistant to panErb
inhibitors (because of the late appearance of a mutated
KRAS), the addition of MEK inhibitors could partially
overcome resistance. This re-sensitization was more
complete when a MEK inhibitor was given together with a
panErb inhibitor. These lines were initially sensitive to the
panErb inhibitors cetuximab or panitumab, but resistance
emerged through subsequent new KRAS mutations. We
examined in our model the simulated behavior before and
after the emergence of a resistance to panErb inhibitors.
To do so we generated personalized MIM modeling, in the
absence or presence of KRAS alterations. We simulated
the presence of a panErb inhibitor, a MEK inhibitor, or
both. The behavior of P-protein/total protein for EGFR,
ERK, AKT (at 30 min - 1 hour) was well compatible
with the authors’ observations (Supplementary Material
5.2). Moreover, both c-MYC and CCND1 mRNAs (both
playing a crucial role for cell replication), were completely
normalized (at 4 - 8h), only by the combination of panErb
and MEK inhibitors in the presence of a mutated KRAS
(Supplementary Material 5.2). Our simulations suggest
that this behavior is due to a synergic effect of the two
inhibitors, which target two different pathways: MEK
inhibitor downstream of the KRAS mutated pathway, and
PanErb inhibitor on the PI3K-AKT pathway.
This synergism seems in line with that observed by
the authors at a cellular level. The behavior of our model
in this new context, being able to satisfactorily reflect
these independent and subsequent experimental findings,
was quite encouraging.

DISCUSSION
We started from a signaling-network model without
cancer mutations (a “physiologic model”) and generated
models including specific mutations/alterations (in
our MIM region), concordant with those present in the
HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer lines. We demonstrated
that this model can be tuned with the individual genetic
background of a tumor (using cell lines as a proxy), to
predict individual responses to inhibitor treatments.
This is an encouraging finding, suggesting that larger
similar models using a similar conceptual framework,
generated by larger cooperative groups (perhaps consortiawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

framework and details of our simulation-engine, and
its specific parameters, were all established during the
training phase. Only after completion of the training phase
and its satisfactory behavior in dealing with the input data,
we moved to the verification phase, where we compared
the predictions of our simulation-engine with our ex
novo experimental results. Using a different phrasing,
retrofitting procedures were continuous and systematic
during the training phase, but strictly confined only to that
phase.
As described in the statistical section, both
correlation and goodness of fit between simulations and
ex novo experiments, have been quite encouraging. It
seems therefore really worthwhile to move ahead and
to build larger improved models. Computer power is
continuously increasing and should not be a problem for
the implementation of larger models.
Our model was also successfully tested against
the results of a novel publication [59], available several
months after the conclusion of our model training phase,
and also after the conclusion of our wet experiments.
By constructing personalized MIMs adapted to panErb
sensitive or resistant four CRC lines, once again our model
proved to be predictive of the experimental response (last
paragraph of Results section and Supplementary Material
5.2). Supplementary Material 5.2 refers specifically to the
work of Misale et al [59].		
Our MIMs have specific properties in terms of a
Graph Theory perspective [64, 65]. We have preliminary
evidence that these MIMs, and their dynamic modeling,
at this stage of development, can withstand a significant
degree of parameter approximation. They can provide
an important tool to collating the increasingly complex
data on oncogenic signaling and translating it into a
program that can be easily interrogated, enhancing human
understanding of highly non-linear biological signaling
networks. These biochemical-interactions networks, over a
given size, are clearly beyond unaided human capabilities
of comprehension of what is going on [66].
At the same time this is not an all or nothing
process, as we do not have to know every detail to reach
a more advanced understanding. It seems therefore worth
moving forward in this direction, as it may have important
effects on a more rational cancer therapy when treating
patients with signaling-protein inhibitors. This not only in
terms of one-drug therapies, but, in terms of appropriately
tailoring drug combinations to individual patient needs:
an important step in a progress towards a really innovative
type of personalized cancer therapy.
In the near future, more advanced patient specific
tumor data, for instance, from deep sequencing of
tumor biopsies or liquid biopsies (focused on major
driver mutations in a given tumor + some most relevant
additional somatically inheritable driver alterations),
could be routinely incorporated into a model like ours,
to create patient personalized tumor models, capable of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

supporting clinical treatment decisions. Such models
could also potentially inform about the likelihood of some
types of acquired drug resistance evolving after an initial
sensitivity to a given inhibitor. Simulating different types
of perturbation, we could investigate which mutated nodes
could circumvent a drug’s downstream inhibitory effect.
Our dynamic models could represent an approach
complementary to an interesting approach proposed in a
recent paper by Crystal and colleagues [67]. They have
combined a genetic analysis of acquired-resistance tumors
with a pharmacologic screening with targeted agents, to
predict the behavior of an association of inhibitors. They
used a set of 76 antineoplastic drugs, mostly inhibitors
of signaling-proteins (cancer-genes). Their approach
was successful, but required an important amount of
experimental work to find a working association, in terms
of cell growth inhibition. A modeling approach could help
to detect priorities and restrict the number of proposed
associations, to be finally tested / validated at a cellular
level.
Such modeling approaches, which collate the
continuously accumulating disparate data from basic
biological research into integrated predictive userfriendly models with clinical utility, should fulfill in the
cancer field the broad promise of Systems Medicine: the
translation of Systems research into Clinical tools [68].
Progress in this direction will be gradually accompanied
by a better understanding and acceptance by clinicians.
Extended MIM dynamic models could also be
utilized to inform new clinical trials (of both novel
compounds and combination therapies) potentially
improving the failure rate observed in such trials.
In a recent example Erlotinib (an EGFR inhibitor)
and anti-MET onartuzumab would not synergize
effectively in the majority of NSCLC patients in a phase
III study [69]. This lack of synergism could have been the
consequence of multiple mutations/alterations commonly
found in the network downstream of EGFR and MET.
Perhaps their role could have been understood in advance
in the framework of a dynamic modeling. It could be
possible to consider the administration of some additional
downstream inhibitor. A complementary deeper molecular
characterization of each individual cancer could focus
combination treatments towards subsets of patients more
homogeneous, characterized at a network-pathology level.
In conclusion, we feel that this is a road to a
novel and important approach with utility to oncology
and medicine more generally. We foresee that second
generation descendents of this modeling approach will
be progressively chosen more frequently to interpret
preclinical and clinical research into onco-protein
mutations and to suggest rational combinations of
inhibitors. We consider this perspective a better alternative
to the more reductionist current approach, of considering
substantially a summation of biomarkers, to be matched
with a given therapeutic hypothesis.

for activation or repression of MYC and CCND1 were
identified, as well as the main transcription factors (TFs)
that bind to them (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Material
4.2). Each TF identified was included in the MIM. As the
two genes were found to have similar key transcriptional
regulators, it was assumed that they have equivalent
promoter regions and the same transcription rates. We
observed however important experimental differences in
the degradation rates of the two mRNAs. In our model we
accounted also for these differences.
The entire collection of all five TFBSs, all activators
and repressors considered in the MIM, RNA Polymerase
II (RNAP) and the RNAP binding site was denoted in
the model by Promoter/TF/RNAP (Supplementary Fig.
4.1). Similarly, each individual TFBS and its associated
TFs, when paired with RNAP and the RNAP binding
site, formed a theoretical reduced promoter region termed
TFBS/TF/RNAP. Standard statistical thermodynamic
assumptions and procedures were applied in deriving
the transcription rate function, with some extensions to
the original method to encompass the complexity of the
promoter under consideration (Supplementary Material
4.3).
The probability of RNAP binding to the promoter
can be written in terms of the regulation factor

METHODS
Simulations using ODEs
For dynamic simulations we formulated the
reactions scheme as Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODEs) according to Supplementary Table 2.1, in terms
of the reactions’ kinetic laws [70]. The ODE models were
developed and simulated with the SimBiology toolbox of
the Matlab software (Mathworks)[20].
We performed our simulations for mRNA levels
at 4 – 8 h. As changes in protein phosphorylation above
transcription (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1.3) take
place much more rapidly, they were experimentally
assessed at 30 min (and 60 min with substantially similar
results).
We assigned initially a total concentration (relative
to a given basic-protein plus all its complexes and posttranslational modifications) entirely to the unbound basic
protein (Supplementary Table 2.2). The presence of
mutations/alterations and/or inhibitors, according to the
cell line and experimental conditions being simulated,
were introduced to the model at this early stage. Reactions
were then brought to a quasi-stationary equilibrium, which
causes redistribution of each basic protein among all its
forms and complexes with binding partners (SimBiology

associated with the promoter, a function of TF
concentrations parameterized by TF-DNA dissociation
constants (Supplementary Material 4.3):
(a) It was
shown that under certain conditions (i.e. independence of
TFBSs) the regulation factor of Promoter/TF/RNAP can
be written as the product of the regulation factors over
all its constituent TFBS/TF/RNAP parts (Supplementary
Material 4.4), i.e.
(b) The
mRNA production rate was assumed to be proportional
to the probability of RNAP binding to the promoter for
transcription initiation [72,73]. Therefore, for each TFBS/
TF/RNAP a regulation factor was derived (Supplementary
Tables 4.7 - 4.12) and a final expression for the
transcription rates of MYC and CCND1 was obtained
(Supplementary Material 4.6),

Thermo-statistical derivation of a transcription
rate function for MYC and CCND1
This is a quick guide to main equations and
assumptions, for more details see also the pertinent Ss.
The first step in building the thermo-statistical model
involved identifying key transcription factor binding sites
(TFBSs) responsible for MYC and CCND1 activation and
repression, as well as the main TFs that bind to them. We
have considered only some of the most important and best
studied TFs (see reviews on MYC transcription (1, 2 in
Supplementary Fig. 4.1), CCND1 transcription (3, 4 in
Supplementary Fig. 4.1). 	
The transcription rate function of a gene describes
the relationship between the gene’s rate of transcription
and the cellular concentrations of upstream transcriptional
activator and repressor complexes. A single (as a firstapproximation) transcription rate function for the MYC
and CCND1 genes was mathematically derived using a
statistical thermodynamic framework [71-73]. First, the
key transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) responsible

was obtained by Eqn. (a) and thermostatistical methods (Supplementary Materials 4).
The parameter ksynth was assigned the value of
5•10-5/sec both for the synthesis of MYC and CCND1.
The parameter kdeg was assigned values of 2.7•10-4/
sec or 5.7•10-6/sec, for degradation of MYC or CCND1
respectively, in the absence of any inhibitor (Fig. 3B and
Supplementary Table 2.1, where we report Eqns 863, 864,
867, 868).
The degradation rate kdeg for CCND1 mRNA was

modified according to our experimental observation
of decreased mRNA stability in the presence of
MEK inhibitor CI1040 (Results section: Fig. 3C and
Supplementary Table 2.1).
In our model, the velocity of degradation of a
reactant was described as the product of the reactant
concentration with its degradation rate (Eqs. 747, 748,
770, 775, 782, 864).
Considering the effect of MEK inhibitor on the
stability of CCND1 mRNA, observed experimentally in
Fig. 3C, CCND1 mRNA degradation rate (kdegCCND1) was
empirically adjusted, in the presence of MEK inhibitor, as:
kdegCCND1+MEKinhib = kdegCCND1contr•[ERKPPcontrol/
ERKPPMEK inhib] (d)
(related to Eqn 868 reported in Supplementary Table
2.1).
MEK inhibitor CI1040 decreases [ERKPP] levels,
therefore, in the presence of the inhibitor, [ERKPPcontrol/
ERKPPMEK inhib] > 1. The empirical formula implemented in
Eqn 868 increases kdegCCND1 with an inverse proportionality
in respect to the degree of ERK phosphorylation.

protein. In the case of PTEN, we input its concentration
at 60% of its physiological value, according to our
experimental results in HCT116 cells (Supplementary
Material 3). We could also simulate the presence of
a single functional allele (data not reported). In the
case of hyper-expressed onco-proteins, e.g. ErbB2, its
concentration was raised 2x in HT29 cells (Supplementary
Material 3).

Implementation of our virtual inhibitors
As reported in Table SM2.1, we applied the
following inhibitors: MEKPP inhibitor CI1040, PI3K
inhibitor PI103, AKTP inhibitor Perifosine, GSK3β
inhibitor Azakenpaullone, Tankyrase inhibitor XAV939
(XAV939 stimulates β-catenin degradation by stabilizing
Axin, which is part of the [Axin:GSK3β:APC] degradation
complex for β-catenin).
According to the information given by the company
selling the inhibitor (see below), and to the concentration
of inhibitor used, we calculated different inhibition levels
for each inhibitor (Supplementary Material 3.1)

Experimental derivation of MYC and CCND1
mRNA degradation rates

Cell culture and reagents

To evaluate MYC and CCND1 mRNA (qPCR)
stability in HCT116 and HT29 cell lines, we performed
RT-qPCR (see below) after treatment with the pantranscriptional inhibitor Actinomycin D (Act D) (SigmaAldrich) at 5 µg/ml. Our results (see Results section)
demonstrate the very different mRNA stability of MYC
and CCND1 and highlight the importance of including
stability/degradation rates in any MIM/mathematical
modeling.

The HCT116 and HT29 CRC cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). For details about cell culture conditions and
reagents, Supplementary Material 3.1.

RT-qPCR experiments
We treated our CRC lines with an individual
inhibitor, inhibitor combinations, vehicle only, or no
treatment, for the durations indicated below. At the end
of treatment, we extracted total RNA from the cells
using an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was used to
synthesize cDNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription
Kit (Qiagen), including a genomic DNA digestion step.
We generated biological duplicates for all samples at
all time-points, and performed technical replicates for
every sample and time-point. We performed reverse
transcription qPCR on an ABI 7900HT Real Time qPCR
System (Applied Biosystems) with TaqMan reagents
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
recommended protocol. Gene expression was normalized
to the expression of β-actin (Assay I.D: 4326315E),
with P0 ribosomal protein (Assay I.D: 4310879E) as a
second control. MYC and CCND1 expression levels were
detected with assays Hs00905030_m1* and Hs00765553_
m1* respectively.	

Mutations/Alterations in our CRC lines: virtual
implementation
The mutations present in our ATCC CRC lines
are described in CCLE database [74]. Four dominant
mutations in terms of pathway activation (KRAS
(HCT116), β-Catenin (HCT116), BRAF (HT29),
PI3K (both lines) have been implemented according
to the simplifying rule that the activated protein will
remain in a phosphorylated or in an “active” form (dephosphorylation/“inactivation” was prevented in the
biochemical dynamical implementation of the model).
According to our experimental results reported in
Supplementary Material 3, HT29 cells over-expressed
ErbB2 ~ 2x, and this variation was also simulated in our
modeling. To model the five alterations involving the loss
of function, resulting in global pathway activation (PTEN
(HCT116), E-Cadherin (HCT116), TGFβ receptor II
(HCT116), APC (HT29), SMAD4 (HT29)), we put zero
