BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to assess the efficacy and toxicity of sorafenib as front-line therapy
in patients with stage IIIB (pleural effusion) or IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Patients received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily by mouth continuously, and were evaluated every 2 weeks during the first 8 weeks. Patients
who manifested clinical progression during this period proceeded to receive standard of care. The primary endpoint
was confirmed objective tumor response. A 2-stage Fleming design was used such that if at most 1 confirmed partial
response (PR) or complete response was observed in the first 20 patients (stage 1), the treatment would be considered ineffective, and further enrollment would be discontinued. RESULTS: Only 1 PR was observed in the first 20
patients. By the time of study closure, 5 additional patients who were already being screened for study inclusion
were enrolled. Of the 25 patients (15 women, 10 men; 4 stage IIIB, 21 stage IV; median age, 67 years [range, 45-85
years]), there were 3 (12%) PRs and 6 (24%) cases with stable disease observed. The median time-to-progression and
progression-free survival was 2.8 months. Seven (28%) patients remained progression-free at 24 weeks. No grade 3
or higher hematologic adverse events were observed. Thirteen (52%) patients had a grade 3 nonhematologic adverse
event, with fatigue (20%), diarrhea (8%), and dyspnea (8%) being the most common. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib is
not effective as front-line therapy in the general unselected NSCLC population. The window of opportunity design is

Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer mortality in the US and throughout the world.1 In 2008, it was estimated that 215,250 individuals would be diagnosed with lung cancer in the US.1 Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
comprises >75% of lung cancers and has been particularly difficult to treat effectively. Curative resection is possible in
only 30% of patients at diagnosis, with metastatic disease developing in 50% of patients within 5 years.2

Phase 2 First-Line Sorafenib in NSCLC/Dy et al

Increased understanding of lung cancer at the molecular level has allowed the development of novel targeted therapies for this disease,3 and the use of these
agents in NSCLC continues to grow. A wide variety of
prognostic factors that predict response to targeted agents
are being investigated for NSCLC, and include tumor
suppressor genes (p53 and Rb), growth factor receptors
(epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), and dominant oncogenes (Ras).4 Angiogenesis has also been implicated in growth and metastatic processes in various
malignancies including lung cancer, whereby inhibition
of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)
signaling has demonstrated clinical benefit.5-7
Sorafenib (Nexavar; BAY 43-9006) is a multikinase
inhibitor of Raf-1, wild-type B-Raf, oncogenic b-raf
V599E, VEGFR-1/-2/-3, PDGFR-b, c-Kit, Flt-3, and
RET in vitro.8,9 Sorafenib inhibited the growth of a variety of tumor xenograft models driven by up-regulation of
Raf/MEK/ERK signaling.8 Sorafenib also blocked tumor
proliferation and angiogenesis,8 and promoted apoptosis
in several cancer cell lines including NSCLC.10 Tolerability and preliminary efficacy of sorafenib were investigated
in 4 dose-escalation phase 1 trials in patients with treatment-refractory, advanced solid tumors.11-14 The optimum dose established was sorafenib 400 mg twice daily
(b.i.d.), given in an uninterrupted schedule.11-14 Clinical
activity with significant partial responses or prolonged disease stability was demonstrated in patients with hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma (RCC).12-14 Sorafenib also
demonstrated antitumor activity and tolerability in phase
1 combination trials, with no clinically relevant drug
interactions seen with concomitant administration of
interferon-a2,15 carboplatin/paclitaxel,16 gemcitabine,17
or oxaliplatin.18
Sorafenib (400 mg b.i.d.) monotherapy was further
evaluated in a phase 2 randomized discontinuation trial in
advanced RCC patients, which demonstrated a significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus
placebo.19 Sorafenib induced disease restabilization in
patients whose tumors progressed on placebo and who
were crossed over to sorafenib.19 This was confirmed in a
phase 3 trial (Treatment Approaches in Renal cancer
Global Evaluation Trial [TARGETs]) involving patients
with clear-cell RCC.20 Sorafenib significantly prolonged
PFS 2-fold versus placebo, and was generally well tolerated. Ten percent of patients receiving sorafenib had partial responses, and 78% of patients had stable disease
(SD), versus 2% and 55% on placebo (P<.001 and
P<.01, respectively). Sorafenib has thus been approved in

Cancer

several countries worldwide for the treatment of RCC. It
has also been granted orphan drug status in hepatocellular
carcinoma by the US Food and Drug Administration and
European Commission based on superior PFS and overall
survival compared with placebo.21,22
It had been assumed that the efficacy of novel agents
in NSCLC will be more accurately determined if these
agents were tested in the front-line setting because of
emergence of mutations arising from exposure to various
therapies, thus conferring treatment resistance over
time.23 On the basis of this assumption we designed a
front-line ‘‘window-of-opportunity’’ study. Patients with
previously untreated NSCLC received single-agent sorafenib, and were closely monitored, with intent to introduce
platinum-based chemotherapy at the initial sign of
progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients with histologic or cytologic evidence of measurable
metastatic or stage IIIB (with malignant pleural effusion)
NSCLC with no prior chemotherapy were eligible for this
study. Eligibility criteria also included: age 18 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2;
prior radiation was not to encompass >30% bone marrow
reserve, could not be of target lesions, and should have been
completed at least 4 weeks before study enrollment; life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; and adequate bone marrow
(platelets 100,000/lL, absolute neutrophil count >1500/
lL, hemoglobin 10 g/dL), hepatic (total bilirubin 2
the upper limit of normal, aspartate transaminase 3 normal), and renal (serum creatinine 1.5 the upper limit of
normal) function. Patients with brain metastases, those
receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, and those with bleeding diatheses were excluded. The protocol was approved by
the institutional review boards, and all patients were
required to give written informed consent under federal and
institutional guidelines.
Experimental Treatment
This was a phase 2, open-label, window of opportunity
study of sorafenib as front-line treatment for advanced
NSCLC. Patients received sorafenib dosed at 400 mg twice
daily continuously, with a cycle defined as 4 weeks. Patients
were evaluated every 2 weeks during the first 2 cycles, with
those who manifested clinical progression (eg, worsening
symptoms, physical examination, or test abnormalities) proceeding to receive standard chemotherapy.

Clinical Care of Patients
Complete patient histories, physical examinations, complete blood cell counts, serum electrolytes, chemistries,
and urinalysis were performed at baseline and before each
cycle of treatment. Home blood pressure monitoring was
performed to evaluate the incidence and severity of hypertension. Laboratory studies were repeated weekly together
with evaluation for clinical progression. Unless there was
evidence of clinical progression, radiologic studies (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) were
performed at baseline and after every 2 cycles of therapy
to assess tumor response. Common Toxicity Criteria for
Adverse Events version 3 was used for adverse event monitoring and reporting. Criteria for discontinuation from
study included: Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3 to 4
drug-related toxicity requiring a treatment delay 2
weeks, progressive disease, withdrawal of consent, or
change in patient’s condition that made further treatment
inappropriate.
Statistical Design
A 2-stage phase 2 study based on a Fleming design was
conducted to assess the antitumor efficacy of this regimen.
The primary endpoint was confirmed tumor response rate
(RR). A treatment success was defined as either a complete
response (CR) or partial response (PR) observed on 2 consecutive evaluations >4 weeks apart. This trial was
designed to test the null hypothesis that the true treatment
success rate was at most 5% against the alternative that it
was at least 20% using a sample size of 42 patients with a
significance level of .10 and power of 90%. To test this
hypothesis, 20 patients were to be entered for stage 1
enrollment. If at most 1 success was observed, the treatment would be considered ineffective in this patient population, and enrollment would be discontinued. If at least
4 confirmed responses were observed, the regimen would
be considered promising, and the trial results would be
published. If 2 or 3 successes were observed in stage 1, we
were to proceed to stage 2. During stage 2, we were to
enter an additional 22 patients. If 4 or fewer confirmed
responses were observed for the entire cohort, this regimen was to be deemed ineffective for this patient population. If at least 5 confirmed responses were observed, this
regimen was to be deemed promising and recommended
for further testing.
Survival time was defined as the time from registration to death from any cause. Time to progression was
defined as the time from registration to the date of first
documented disease progression. If a patient died without

5688

documentation of disease progression, the patient was
considered to have had tumor progression at the time of
death, unless there was sufficient documented evidence to
conclude otherwise.
Tumor response was collected on this trial using the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.24 Confirmed tumor RR is computed as the number of confirmed CRs or PRs divided by the total number of
evaluable patients. Exact binomial confidence intervals
(CIs) for the true treatment success rate were constructed.25 The distribution of time to progression and
overall survival time was estimated using the KaplanMeier Method.26 The duration of response was defined as
beginning from the time the measurement criteria for a
CR/PR were first met until documentation of disease progression for those patients who had objectively responding
(CR or PR) disease. The duration of SD was calculated as
the time from the first assessment of SD to documentation of disease progression. Adverse event data were collected on this trial using version 3.0 of the Common
Toxicity Criteria. The maximum grade for each type of
adverse event was recorded over the course of treatment
and summarized for analysis. All adverse events were
included in analysis regardless of treatment attribution.
Because this was a single-arm trial, the observed
overall survival of this cohort of patients was compared
with a predicted survival estimate for a similar cohort of
patients, where the predicted survival probabilities for
each patient were calculated using the prognostic model
based on an underlying Cox Proportional Hazards model
previously described by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group lung group.27 Pretreatment performance status, hemoglobin levels, and absolute neutrophil counts
(ANCs) were used to predict the survival probability of
each patient at each unique observed failure time. Because
ANC values were collected in this trial rather than white
blood cell (WBC) counts, the model described by the
North Central Cancer Treatment Group lung group27
was rerun to incorporate baseline ANC values rather than
WBC count. Body mass index was not included in the
model, as this was not collected for this trial. The probabilities at each failure time were then averaged across
patients to obtain the predicted survival curve. The
observed survival was then visually compared with the
predicted survival in an effort to understand the impact of
this regimen compared with the survival of patients with
similar prognostic factors who received systemic therapy
on previous North Central Cancer Treatment Group
trials.

RESULTS
A total of 25 patients were enrolled in this trial between
December 2004 and June 2005. Although there was a discontinuation of enrollment between the first and second
stages of this trial, 5 additional patients from multiple sites
had given consent and been registered for the study before
release of a study suspension memo after the initial 20
evaluable patients were accrued, and thus a total of 25
patients were allowed to be enrolled before the efficacy
evaluation. Four patients remain alive with a median follow-up of 40 months (range, 15.7-40.9 months). All
patients were deemed eligible and were evaluable for all
study endpoints. The median age was 67 years (range, 4585). Sixty percent of patients were women, 92% white,
48% had a performance status of 0, and 84% presented
with stage IV disease. Fifty-two percent of patients had

unidentified (1 patient with NSCLC of unverified histologic subtype). See Table 1 for a summary of baseline
characteristics. Smoking status was not collected for this
trial. The median number of treatment cycles received
was 3, with a range from 1 to 26. Twenty-two (88%) of
the 25 participants went off treatment because of disease
progression; 1 patient went off study treatment because of
refusal to receive further therapy, 1 patient died on study,
and 1 patient discontinued study treatment because of
unresolved psychiatric issues.
Adverse Events
Adverse events reported in this trial were generally mild,
with no reported grade 3þ hematologic events. At least 1
grade 3þ nonhematologic event during the course of the
trial was reported in 13 (52%) patients. The most common (events reported in 5% or more of patients) grade 3
events reported included fatigue (20%), diarrhea (8%),
and dyspnea (8%). A grade 4 pulmonary hemorrhage was
reported in 1 patient, with severe oxygen-dependent
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a large cavitary
left upper lobe mass. This patient was hospitalized because
of grade 3 dyspnea a week before the hemorrhagic event.
No pulmonary embolism was found, although postobstructive pneumonia was diagnosed, and subsequent treatment was rendered accordingly. The day after hospital
discharge, the patient had grade 5 hypoxia and grade 4
pulmonary hemorrhage judged by the treating physician
to be most likely related to tumor erosion into the pulmonary vasculature. However, contribution from study treatment cannot be totally excluded. See Tables 2 and 3 for
more detail on reported adverse events. All adverse events
are included regardless of treatment attribution.
Efficacy
Only 1 partial response was observed in the first 20
patients, thus the study did not meet the first stage efficacy
criteria. A total of 3 PRs (12% RR; 95% CI, 2.6-31.2%)
and 6 SDs (24%; 95% CI, 9.4-45.1%) were observed in
the 25 patients. The median duration of response for these
3 PR patients was 2.7 months, with a range of 2.5 to 15.7
months. The median duration of SD for the 6 SD patients
was 7.5 months, with a range of 1.5 to 23.9 months. Progression-free status at 24 weeks was also evaluated in addition to response, with 7 patients (28%; exact CI, 12.1%49.4%) remaining progression free at 24 weeks. The median time to progression and overall survival were 2.8
months (95% CI, 1.8-4.6 months) and 8.8 months (95%
CI, 5.1-16.9 months), respectively. The estimates for PFS

were identical to time to progression (because of classification as disease progression at the time of death). See Figure 1 for Kaplan-Meier overall survival curve for the
entire cohort as well as the predicted survival curve. The
observed overall survival of patients was comparable to
the predicted survival for this cohort. The Kaplan-Meier
curve for time to progression is given in Figure 2.
Although there are no survival differences according to
histology, interpretation of subset analysis is limited by
the small population of patients.
It was not standard to collect data on subsequent
treatment on disease progression in this trial. These data
were available for 9 (36%) patients: 3 patients did not
receive further therapy, 2 patients received only radiation
therapy, and 4 patients received systemic therapy (2
received platinum-based combination, 1 received docetaxel, and 1 received erlotinib).

DISCUSSION
NSCLC, which to date is a relatively chemoresistant
malignancy, is the leading cause of cancer death throughout the world, largely because approximately 50% of lung
cancer cases present in the advanced stages. Although
there have been increased systemic therapy options for
NSCLC over the years, the clinical outcome is still dismal.
The median survival of patients with advanced disease

5690

receiving the best triplet therapy is approximately 12
months, and response rates range from 35% to 50%.28,29
The clinical efficacy of targeted agents such as erlotinib and gefitinib has demonstrated an approximately
10% response rate as monotherapy in patients with previously treated, chemotherapy-refractory advanced
NSCLC.30,31 Antitumor activity in second- and thirdline settings may be limited, evidently by known redundancies within the network of cross-signaling pathways as
well as by the emergence of pleiotropic mechanisms of resistance because of genetic instability in cancer cells.
Related to this is the less recognized but documented
effect of chemotherapy exposure in altering expression
patterns of potential drug targets.32-34 To address this
issue, the window of opportunity design has been suggested as an alternative design to test the true efficacy of a
new agent in a particular disease before any therapy.
Opponents of this approach raise ethical concerns with
the use of an agent with unknown efficacy when an
accepted standard therapy is available. We demonstrated
that when the study is carefully designed to closely monitor patients, this approach is feasible and ethical.
In this study, sorafenib as a single agent achieved a
response rate of 12% in the 25 patients. Although these
results did not meet the protocol-defined prespecified criteria for success, they do document activity of sorafenib as
a single agent in NSCLC. This response rate is in contrast
to the lack of objective response (response rate, 0%) documented in 1 single-arm second-line study of sorafenib in
NSCLC,35 suggesting that indeed, cross-trial differences
aside, there is a distinct possibility of a higher response
rate when sorafenib is used as front-line therapy. A similar
conclusion can be reached when comparing our results
with the report by Schiller et al, wherein sorafenib was
tested in a phase 2 randomized discontinuation design (vs
placebo) in heavily pretreated NSCLC patients (patients
must have received at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens).36 Among 342 patients who received sorafenib during the run-in phase, 2% had a PR. Among the 83
patients who had SD after 8 weeks of monotherapy and
subsequently were randomized to either placebo or sorafenib therapy for another 8 weeks, 3% and 2% of patients
in the placebo and sorafenib group, respectively, had a
PR, whereas another 6% in the placebo group sustained a
PR on crossover.36 This study met its endpoint of disease
stabilization at 8 weeks after randomization compared
with placebo (47% vs 19%, P<.01).
Overall survival of the patients in our study was
comparable to the predicted survival for this cohort, based

on a previously published North Central Cancer Treatment Group prognostic model.27 The influence of second-line therapy on the overall survival estimates is
unclear, as subsequent treatment information was not systematically collected and thus was unavailable for 64% of
the patients in this trial. Although this implies that sorafenib followed by chemotherapy is unlikely to improve survival compared with chemotherapy alone, a notable
observation is that the 24-week PFS with sorafenib therapy is comparable to that seen in a similar population of
patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy,27,37 suggesting
the likelihood of benefit in a select group of patients in
various settings, such as in maintenance therapy after a
first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy regimen. Whether our observation of prolonged PFS in certain patients may be attributed to underlying tumor
biology itself or the interaction with drug treatment cannot be ascertained. Because of the small sample size, which

with paclitaxel/carboplatin in squamous cell lung cancer,38 it is possible that exclusion of squamous cell lung
cancer patients from sorafenib studies of NSCLC may
reveal a more robust clinical efficacy profile. However, we
acknowledge that this is speculative and that the impact of
histology on the outcomes could not be reliably evaluated
in this trial because of the small sample size. Further studies of sorafenib along this line as well as rational combinations with other targeted agents are warranted.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES

Results from a randomized phase 3 study (ESCAPE)
of first-line carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without sorafenib in advanced NSCLC have been recently
reported.38 The study was terminated after a planned interim analysis of the 926 patients enrolled showed no difference in response rate, PFS, or its primary endpoint of
overall survival. In a subset analysis, patients with tumors
of squamous cell histology who received sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy had worse overall survival
than patients receiving chemotherapy alone (8.9 vs 13.6
months; hazard ratio, 1.85). Other VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as cediranib and motesanib, multikinase inhibitors such as sunitinib, and dual EGFR/
VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as vandetanib
have been studied as single-agent therapies or in combination with chemotherapy. An apparent recurring theme
that emerged is the finding of worse clinical outcomes in
patients with squamous cell histology in some of the
chemotherapy combination studies. This has led to temporary suspension of several phase 3 studies (eg,
MONET1, NEXUS), with subsequent study enrollment
limited to patients whose tumors were nonsquamous in
histologic type. On a contrary note, the phase 3 study of
cediranib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel
revealed that response rate and PFS were improved on
addition of cediranib, but the dose of 30 mg once daily
was poorly tolerated. Analysis did not reveal increased risk
of pulmonary bleeding in patients with squamous histology, and there was no evidence of interaction of efficacy
outcomes with histologic subtype.39
In conclusion, although this study failed to meet its
efficacy endpoint, the window of opportunity design was
helpful in documenting the clinical activity of sorafenib in
NSCLC. On the basis of the lack of benefit and in fact,
evidence of poorer survival with sorafenib when combined
