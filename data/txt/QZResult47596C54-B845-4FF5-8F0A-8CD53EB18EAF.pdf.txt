ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Recently, NACT (Neo
Adjuvant Chemotherapy) has been tested as alternative approach for the management
of ovarian cancer patients. A biological predictor helpful in selecting patients for NACT
would be desirable. This study was aimed at identifying actionable mechanisms of
resistance to NACT.
Expression of a panel of microRNAs was screened in a discovery set of 85 patients.
Analysis of the potential targets was conducted in the same RNAs by calculating
significant correlations between microRNAs and genes. Quantitative fluorescent
immunohistochemistry was employed in a validation set of 109 patients.
MiR-193a-5p was significantly overexpressed in the NACT setting. Analysis of
its potential targets demonstrated that this microRNA is also significantly correlated
with HGF and MET genes. Analysis of protein expression in samples taken before and
after NACT demonstrated that both HGF and c-Met are increased after NACT. Patients
who relapse shortly after NACT exhibited the highest relative basal expression of both
HGF and c-Met, while the opposite phenomenon was observed in the best responders.
Mir-193a-5p, HGF and c-Met expression may help select eligible patients for this
modality of treatment. Moreover, inhibitors of this pathway may improve the efficacy
of NACT.

INTRODUCTION

patients will exhibit a response to PDS-CT, relapse with
resistance to additional treatments is common. Fatal
progression of ovarian cancer is sadly the norm, with a
five year survival rate in this disease of just 20-30% and a
ten year survival rate below 10% [1].
In the last decade, a therapeutic treatment alternative
to PDS-CT has been developed. In this scenario, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is delivered before
debulking surgery which is then followed by an additional
round of chemotherapy. This alternative therapeutic
option, initially reserved only for unresectable patients,
is now increasingly utilized. A recent clinical trial

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death for
gynecologic malignancies. In the United States, it is
estimated that approximately 22,200 new cases will be
diagnosed in 2013 and 15,550 deaths will be reported
due to this cause. The high rate of mortality relates
to presentation at advanced stage in roughly 85% of
patients. The standard protocol of treatment for ovarian
cancer includes maximal cytoreductive surgery (primary
debulking surgery, PDS) followed by platinum/taxane
chemotherapy (PDS-CT). Although the majority of the

(EORTC55971) has demonstrated that, in terms of overall
survival, NACT is comparable to PDS-CT, while offering
a lower complication rate and faster recovery after
debulking surgery [2]. Other clinical studies are in line
with the results of the EORTC55971 [3], and support the
notion that NACT is associated with fewer post-surgical
complications. Therefore, it appears possible that NACT
will become an alternative treatment offered to a broader
number of patients in the near future [4]. However, other
studies are contradictory on this topic and still support a
more conservative approach to NACT [5]. This hesitation
is mostly driven by the fact that exposure to chemotherapy
may reduce the ability to visualize cancer during surgical
tumor debulking while at the same time selecting for
survival of the most aggressive, drug-resistant, cancer
cells [6].
While the role of NACT is evolving in the
clinical arena, this treatment modality provides a
unique opportunity to investigate the biology of ovarian
cancer response to chemotherapy and the molecular
mechanisms which may be involved in the emergence
of drug-resistance. To exploit this opportunity, we
compared microRNA and gene expression of potential
actionable targets in patients treated with NACT as
compared to those treated with PDS-CT. Thereafter, we
validated the results at the protein level using fluorescent
quantitative immunohistochemistry. Results indicate that
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor c-Met
are significantly increased post-NACT patients, thus
representing potential molecular targets for combination
chemotherapy in this population.

multitude of potential molecular pathways involved in this
phenomenon. We chose twenty-eight microRNAs whose
expression has been recently related to ovarian cancer cell
drug resistance [7]. All the microRNAs were analyzed
with a nanofluidic genetic analyzer which made possible
for the low volume of reaction (10 nanoliters) to perform
microRNA and gene expression on the same RNA sample.
The results of all the patients were grouped according to
treatment (either PDS-CT or NACT), and statistically
significant differences (p-value <0.05) were computed
with the use of Wilcoxon test. As shown in Fig. 1A, two
microRNAs (miR-141 and miR-143) were downregulated
and twelve (miR-20a, miR-183, miR-125b, miR-27a, mir92s, let-7g, miR-128, miR-320, miR-145, miR-221, let7c
and miR-193a-5p) were upregulated in the NACT setting.
MiR-193a-5p exhibited the most significant upregulation.
All the significant 14 microRNAs were analyzed
for potential actionable targets using the microRNA.org
search engine. Each gene was prioritized for scoring and
then screened in the Genecard and Pubmed database for
the presence of a correspondent drug inhibitor. Eighty
target genes were chosen according to such criteria.

Discovery set analysis of gene and microRNA
expression
A clinical cohort of 85 ovarian cancer patients,
whose clinical features are summarized in Table 1, was
enrolled in a retrospective analysis as discovery set.
Sixty-three patients were treated with traditional PDS-CT
while twenty-two underwent NACT. For both categories
of patients, a paraffin block of tumor from the first
surgery was analyzed. While the PDS-CT patients were
previously untreated, the NACT patients received from
three to six cycles of standard chemotherapy (platinum/
taxane) before debulking surgery. We hypothesized that
under the pressure of chemotherapy, the most resistant
tumor cell clones would show preferential survival and
be over-represented in the sample. In order to identify the
biological circuits underlying resistance (and subsequent
disease progression) in the face of chemotherapy,
we performed microRNA analysis. MicroRNAs can
regulate hundreds of genes and provide clues regarding a

Gene and microRNA expression validation in
109 patients pre/post NACT treatment and in the
TCGA dataset

The genes DROSHA and DICER were included in the
analysis for the average higher levels of expression of
microRNAs observed in the NACT setting. Results for
all the genes are reported in Supplementary Table 1 while
the results of eighteen targets, significantly modulated in
the NACT setting, are shown in Fig. 1B. Among all the
genes significantly regulated in the NACT population, ten
exhibited an inverse correlation (ρ<0:MKI67, CHEK1,
SRC, MET, PBK, PLK1, ERBB2, TWIST1, KIF11,
TGFB1) and eight a direct correlation (ρ>0: MITF, ID4,
CXCR4, CXCL12, GNAI1, CCL2, PTEN, HGF). Analysis
of the mean proportions [8] revealed that the targets of
miR-193a-5p were significantly more represented in the
NACT group than in PDS-CT, thus suggesting that this
microRNA is one of the key drivers modulating gene
expression in NACT patients (Fig. 1C).

NACT and PDS-CT patients tend to have not
overlapping clinical features since NACT is preferentially
reserved for patients featuring high tumor dissemination
unresectable at first diagnosis [9]. In order to validate
the results obtained in the discovery set we enrolled an
additional clinical cohort (validation set) of 109 patients.
In order to overcome a potential confounder effect driven
by clinical differences between NACT and PDS-CT
women, we compared the expression of the three factors
(miR-193a-5p, HGF and MET) in a clinical cohort all
treated with NACT (Tab. 1), with samples collected at
first diagnosis (pre-NACT) and at the interval debulking
surgery (post-NACT). MiR-193a-5p was again remarkably
increased after NACT (Fig. 1D). Similarly, also HGF

is reported along with the statistical significance calculated with Wilcoxon test. In black, red and green are reported the microRNAs not
significantly modulated, significantly decreased in NACT and significantly increased in NACT, respectively. B: Dot plot showing the results

significantly modulated are shown. C: ANOM analysis of the target significantly modulated in NACT. Y-axis indicates the perecentages

group mean. The mean line across the middle of each diamond represents the group mean. A statistically significant increase was noticed
for both miR193a-5p and HGF. A significant decrease was also reported for MET (Wilcoxon assay).

and MET genes were significantly upregulated and
downregulated after NACT, respectively (Fig. 1D). These
results confirmed the validity of the observations we made
in the discovery set for these three variables.
In order to connect these findings with response to
NACT, the expression of miR-193a-5p, HGF and MET
was analyzed after grouping patients according to platinum
free interval (PFI). We categorized patients into three
groups according to PFI as refractory (PFI<3 months),
resistant (PFI 3-12 months) and sensitive (PFI>12
months). PFI represents the time between last platinum
therapy and disease relapse and is a known correlate of
overall survival in ovarian cancer [10]. Our clinical setting
was not different and outcome was driven by PFI status
(Fig. 2A). The expression of miR-193a-5p was increased
in the refractory group (Fig. 2B) and accompanied by a

concomitant increase of HGF (Fig. 2C) and a decrease of
MET (Fig. 2D).
To our knowledge this is the first study in which
miR-193a-5p, HGF and MET are analyzed in NACT
patients, thus making difficult external crossvalidation of
our findings. In order to support our results, we analyzed
the expression of the three factors in the TCGA dataset
[11]. As a proxy of our clinical subset, we restricted the
analysis to patients with stage IV (n=58), which is a
clinical setting with a disease so extended which would
be treated with NACT in our Institution. For this reason,
we assumed that this clinical cohort is very similar to
the pre-NACT patients since the TCGA samples were
collected before chemotherapy. Analysis was performed
after grouping patients according to PFI (refractory,
resistant and sensitive) as described above. MiR-193a-

5p levels were again higher in the refractory group as
compared with those noticed in the other groups (Fig. 2E).
Similarly, HGF expression was even in this clinical setting
significantly increased in the refractory group (Fig. 2F),
while MET levels were significantly decreased only in the
refractory setting (Fig. 2G), thus mirroring the trend we
noticed in our validation set.

sample with only the transfecting medium was kept as
negative control while the expression of let-7g was kept
as a reference. After 48 hours, we analyzed endogenous
HGF and MET gene expression to assess the changes
induced by overexpression of the microRNA. In keeping
with the observations in patients reported above, in both
cell lines miR-193a-5p augmented the levels of HGF and
concomitantly repressed MET, while the expression of
a non-target gene like TUBB remained unchanged (Fig.
3C). In order to test the physical association between miR193a-5p and HGF/MET genes, the synthetic microRNA
was pulled down using streptavidin beads. A library of
cDNA was prepared from OV2774 transfected with 10nM
of the microRNA and from the negative control. The
presence of HGF and MET products was ascertained with

In vitro validation of HGF and MET as targets of

support that both HGF and MET are modulated by miR193a-5p through a direct interaction.

CD68 as a marker of macrophages in the HGF analysis
or vimentin as a marker of stromal cells in the c-Met
analysis, pan-cytokeratin as a marker of epithelial tumor
cells and the two protein antigens of interest (red channel).
A representative image is depicted in Fig. 4A. Analysis
was quantified using the AQUA® software. The system
utilizes an unsupervised method to calculate expression of
the antigens using a predefined set of algorithms capable
of scoring the expression in cellular masks of interest. In
our study, we selected two alternative mask pairs: tumor
(cytokeratin) and macrophage (CD68+) for the HGF
analysis and tumor (cytokeratin) and stroma (vimentin+)
for the c-Met analysis. As preliminary approach the
number of cancer cells (cytokeratin positive) was scored
in each specimen coming from pre- and post-NACT.

patients pre/post NACT
In order to extend the analysis to the protein
dimension, TMAs were prepared from the same tumor
specimens reported above. Analysis was performed
in triplicate cores to probe clonal heterogeneity inside
the specimen in both pre and post-NACT specimens.
Analysis was performed in independent replicate slides
using quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemistry in

Average number of cancer cells for specimen did not
change in the refractory and resistant groups post NACT,
while in women with chemo-sensitive disease there was a
decreased presence of tumor cells after NACT (Fig. 4B).
For that concerning HGF, staining was present in both
tumor and macrophages and, similarly, c-Met expression
in both tumor and stromal cells. Correlating gene and
protein expression according to response to NACT, HGF
was significantly increased in patients after NACT (Fig.
5A), while in contrast to the gene expression data, c-Met
was also significantly increased after NACT (Fig. 5B).
In samples taken before NACT, HGF expression was
significantly lower in sensitive patients as compared with
women with refractory or resistant disease. The trend was
similar in both cancer (Fig. 5C) and CD68+ cells (Fig.
5D). Post treatment, again the sensitive group showed a
significantly lower expression of HGF as compared with

the others (Fig. 5 E&F). On the other hand, c-Met was
significantly higher in the refractory group pre-NACT
(Fig. 6 A&C). This difference was accentuated post
treatment in both tumor and stromal cells (Fig. 6 B&D).
Altogether, these findings suggest that high relative
expression of both HGF and c-Met are associated with
refractory disease, whereas low expression of both HGF
and c-Met are related to a favorable response to NACT. To
validate these findings, we re-classified patients into four
subgroups for analysis of PFI as continuous variable: High
HGF/High c-Met, High HGF/Low c-Met, High c-Met/
Low HGF and Low HGF/Low c-Met. PFI (Fig. 6E) was
significantly shorter in the group with High HGF/High
c-Met (7.1 months as compared with the 13.4 months for
patients with Low HGF/Low c-Met). These results suggest
that high expression of miR-193a-5p is associated with
high levels of both HGF and c-Met proteins.

DISCUSSION

fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Analysis started with
a panel of prognostic microRNAs [7]. With the exception
of miR-141 and miR-143 we identified a broad increase
of microRNA levels in NACT patients and a particularly
significant increase of miR-193a-5p. This microRNA is a
central regulator of platinum response in squamous cell
carcinoma and it is overexpressed as a consequence of
the DNA damage induced by chemotherapy [13]. ANOM
analysis indicated miR-193a-5p as a central regulator of
the changes noticed at the gene levels in ovarian cancer
patients after NACT. Among the factors significantly
correlated with miR-193a-5p, we noted both HGF and
MET genes. HGF is a pleiotropic factor involved in the
enhancement of metastatic potential of cancer cells [14]
and MET encodes for its cellular receptor c-Met. Their
expression seems enhanced in aggressive ovarian cancer
[15], although some conflicting data has been published
[16-18]. In our study, we demonstrate for the first time
that the expression of both HGF and c-Met are modulated
under the pressure of chemotherapy in NACT patients.
Noteworthy, the HGF/c-Met pathway seems significantly
altered in terms of expression levels in patients who
subsequently are refractory to NACT, with a PFI ≤ 3

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic
malignancy. Since the advent of standard first line
chemotherapy, no significant improvement in outcome
has been obtained [12] and the most compelling clinical
problem is represented by drug-resistance and progression
upon chemotherapy. This problem is particularly urgent
in NACT which is delivered to reduce tumor burden
before debulking surgery. In fact, NACT will be useless
to reduce tumor mass if the patient will be refractory to
chemotherapy and progress during the treatment.
In this study, we exploited NACT as a tool to
study the mechanism underlying drug resistance due
to the opportunity to sample and analyze surviving
tumor cell clones post-chemotherapy in a cohort of
patients. Moreover, we focused our investigation on
actionable molecular targets in the hopes of enhancing the
translational value of our study and identify a rationale
useful to complement NACT with a targeted agent possibly
useful to increase the response rate in the refractory
group. We employed an integrated approach including
gene/microRNA expression coupled with quantitative

months. Conversely, patients with low relative expression
of HGF and c-Met tended to have longer PFI and a better
outcome. These findings suggest that this pathway could
be exploited as an additional tool to complement clinical
criteria of eligibility for NACT. Indeed, if a patient
exhibits a refractory disease, it is very unlikely that she
will benefit from NACT treatment, which will be unable to
reduce the tumor mass and makes the surgical debulking
easier than pre-NACT. Furthermore, the HGF/c-Met axis
is actionable with a series of targeted strategies [15].
Due to the direct involvement of HGF/c-Met in ovarian
cancer aggressiveness, we believe that our data support the
rationale for clinical trials of inhibitors of the HGF/c-Met
axis in the context of the NACT setting. These inhibitors
would be of particular value in patients for whom NACT
is the only viable treatment option due to extensiveness of
disease at presentation such as stage IV.
The strength of the presented results is coming
from the integration of genomic and proteomic approach.
If gene and microRNA expression can be performed in
a relatively high-throughput way, there is always the
problem of connecting the obtained results with the
expression in individual subset of cells (cancer/stromal)
which are represented in different proportions in a
specimen. This problem is solved by proteomic analysis
with quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemistry.
Using such approach antigens of interest are quantified
in the different subsets of cells regardless of the absolute
amount of cancer/stromal cells in a sample. It is also
important to note that proteomic analysis is mandatory in
order to drive clinical decisions around the use of specific
targeted agents. In fact, we cannot predict from the trends
in gene expression which will be the impact at the protein
level, since a high correlation between gene and protein
expression is present in the majority but not all the genes
in human and mouse cells [19]. In order to be actionable,
the relevant element is not the gene but the protein, which
ultimately will be targeted with a specific drug. In our
analysis, we reported that HGF belongs to the category
of factors in which the trend between gene and protein
expression is the same. On the opposite, MET does not
follow the same rule. If the expression at the gene level
is decreased, in the same specimens the expression of the
protein is increased. How a similar trend can be explained?
At variance with other solid malignancies, in ovarian
cancer c-Met overexpression is not driven by genetic
amplification [20]. For this reason, c-Met inhibitors with
multikinase activity may exhibit less activity in ovarian
cancer than c-Met specific drugs [21]. In this context it is
possible that c-Met increased expression is a mechanism
of adaptation to hypoxia and poor angiogenesis as recently
demonstrated with the use of anti-VEGF therapy [22]. The
same mechanism has been proposed in metastatic breast
cancer where HGF/c-Met axis is exploited to counteract
the functional consequences of hypoxia [23]. These
findings together support the potential clinical utility
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in the refractory NACT setting (exhibiting high HGF
(protein/gene) and low MET gene high c-Met protein)
of the inhibition of both c-Met and HGF. It has been
demonstrated that a block of translation can produce an
apparent upregulation of the most transcribed genes, thus
demonstrating a feedback loop between translation and
mRNA degradation [24-26]. On the opposite, enhancement
of translation can be accompanied by decrease of mRNA
stability and consequent reduced mRNA levels [24].
However, in this context a caveat in our analysis is that
we did not have a separate validation set for the noticed
changes at the protein level. In this sense, our results need
to be confirmed in future prospective clinical trials.
In summary, this translational study demonstrates
that high protein expression levels of HGF/c-Met are
present in patients who will be refractory to NACT. This
finding potentially creates an opportunity to improve
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for a clinical category
of ovarian cancer patients who minimally benefit from
chemotherapy and debulking surgery.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
RNA extraction from FFPE
Two clinical cohorts were analyzed in this
retrospective study. A discovery set (n=85) was composed
by 63 and 22 patients treated with PDS-CT and NACT,
respectively. A validation set (n=109) was composed by
patients all treated with NACT. Clinical features of the two
cohorts are summarized in Tab. 1. After approval of the
Danbury Hospital Internal Review Board and collection
of the relevant clinical information, de-identified FFPE
samples were obtained from ovarian cancer cases that had
been preserved between 2000 and 2008. FFPE samples
were cut to 10 μm thickness and two tissue slices were put
into a 1.5 ml tube. To each tube, one milliliter of xylene
was added for deparaffinization followed by mixing twice
with a high speed vortex for 3 min at room temperature.
Total RNA was then automatically extracted with the
QIAcube using the miRNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) following manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA from
A2780 and OVCAR-3 cells was automatically extracted
with the QIAcube using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA
quantity and the quality were assessed by Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
RNA from the cell lines was used as a reference.

Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was reverse transcribed using High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystem, Foster City, CA). The 20 μl reverse
4863

Oncotarget

transcription reaction contained 10 μl of total RNA, 0.8
μl of 100 nM dNTP, 1 μl of RNase inhibitor 20 U/μl, 1 μl
of reverse transcriptase (50 U/μl), 2 μl of 10X RT random
primers, 2 μl of 10X RT buffer and 3.2 μl of ultrapure H2O.
The reaction mixture was mixed with RNA and incubated
as follows: 25°C for 10 min, 37°C for 120 min and then
85°C for 5 min. For pre-amplification of cDNA, TaqMan
assays were pooled at a final concentration of 0.2X for
each assay. The pre-amplification PCR was performed at
one cycle 95°C for 10 min, 14 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec
and then 60°C for 4 min. After pre-amplification PCR,
the product was diluted 1:5 with DNA Suspension Buffer
and stored at -20°C until needed. Preparation of the chip
was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol on
a BioMark system (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA).
Briefly, an IFC controller was used to prime the fluidics
array chip with control line fluid (~15 min). Samples and
assays were loaded into the 48.48 dynamic array chip
(from Fluidigm Corporation) by inserting the chip into the
IFC controller. The chip was then loaded onto the BioMark
Instrument and the reaction was performed at one cycle
50°C for 120s, one cycle 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles at
95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 4 min. Data analysis was
performed using the real-time PCR Analysis Software of
the Biomark platform (Fluidigm Corporation, CA, USA)
using the delta-delta ct method as previously reported [27,
28]. The TCGA dataset was downloaded from the TCGA
website (http://cancergenome.nih.gov). Level 2 gene
expression data derived from Affymetrix U133A platform
were used to infer the expression of mir-193a-5p, HGF
and MET. Analysis was restricted to stage IV patients
(n=58) and clinical information was downloaded from the
TCGA website.

sample containing 1 × TaqMan Universal Master Mix, 1X
GE Sample Loading Reagent (Fluidigm PN 85000746)
and each of diluted pre-amplified cDNA. Five μl of Assay
mix was prepared with 1X each of TaqMan miRNA assay
and 1X Assay Loading Reagent (Fluidigm PN 85000736).
An IFC controller was used to prime the fluidics array
(chip) with control line fluid and then with samples and
assay mix in the appropriate inlets. After loading, the chip
was placed in the BioMark Instrument for PCR at 95°C
for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and
60°C for 1 min. Data analysis was performed using the
real-time PCR Analysis Software of the Biomark platform
(Fluidigm Corporation, CA, USA) using the delta-delta
ct method as previously reported [27, 29]. Three small
RNAs were used as loading control (RNU44, RNU46,
MAMMU6) while the cell line A2780 was used as a
reference.

Transfection and pull down assay
biotinylated microRNA Mir-193a-5p

Biotinylated Mir-193a-5p was obtained from
Eurofins MWG Operon as a miRNA duplex in which
the sense filament, at the 3’ end, was labeled with a
biotin. The tag used, called Biotin-TEG, was linked
to the miRNA through a 15-atom triethylene glycol
spacer. Both sense and antisense strands carried a 2-nt
3’ overhang, to increase the target sensitivity of siRNA
[30]. The sequence of the duplex Mir-193a-5p is: 5’UGGGUCUUUGCGGGCGAGAUGAUU-3’
and
3’-UCAUCUCGCCCGCAAAGACCUAGA-5’.
OV2774 and SKOV3 cells were seeded in 6 well
dishes, 2x106 cell/well, for 48h without reaching the full
confluency. These cellular models were chosen since
preliminary data demonstrated low expression of miR193a-5p, high expression of MET and low expression of
HGF in the panel of cell lines available in our laboratory.
HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was
used to transfect the cells with the biotin-tagged miRNA at
final concentration of 1, 5 and 10nM. A transfection with
only HiPerFect reagent represented the negative control.
For each cell line RNA extraction and microRNA/gene
expression was performed as described above. Using
dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1(Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) as described by Orom & Lund [31] a pull
down assay of the Mir-193a-5p was performed .The total
RNA extraction from the dynabeads was executed using
rapid homogenization spin-column Qiasheredder and
RNeasy mini KIT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the
manufacturers protocol. The RNA was utilized to prepare
a library of cDNA pulled down as described by Kurimoto
and colleagues [32]. To prove the physical interaction
between Mir-193a-5p and HGF and MET messengers,
a PCR reaction was performed using TaqMan Universal
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA)

MicroRNA expression analysis
Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the
TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystem, Foster City, CA) with the Megaplex RT
Primers, Human Pool A v2.1 (Applied Biosystem, Foster
City, CA). The reaction mixture was mixed with RNA and
incubated as follows: one cycle 16°C for 2 min, 40 cycles
at 42°C for 1 min and 50°C for 1 sec, and then 85°C for
5 min. For pre-amplification of cDNA, the Megaplex
PreAmp Primers (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA)
were used. Pre-PCR amplification reaction was done at 5
μl containing 2.5 μl TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix (2X),
0.5 μl of 10X Megaplex PreAmp Primers and 2 μl of
cDNA. The pre-amplification PCR was performed at one
cycle 95°C for 10 min, one cycle 55°C for 2 min, one
cycle 72°C for 2 min, 18 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and
60°C for 4 min, and then one cycle 99.9°C for 10 min.
After pre-amplification PCR, the product was diluted 1:10
by adding 45 μl of DNA Suspension Buffer and stored at
-20°C until needed.
Briefly, a 5 μl sample mixture was prepared for each

Oncotarget

with HGF, MET and TUBB TaqMan Gene Expression
Assays (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). The
reaction mixture was mixed with cDNA and incubated as
follows: one cycle 50°C for 2 min, one cycle 95°C for 10
min and then 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for
1 min. The profile of the PCR products was evaluated by
using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA).

p-value <0.05. If multiple microRNAs were present with
significant capability of modulating gene expression, the
microRNA with the lowest p-value was selected for the
correlation analysis with gene expression.
For quantification in high vs. low expression of
HGF/c-Met protein the cutoff was represented by the
median value. All statistical analyses were performed with
the JMP9 software package (SAS Institute).

Quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemistry

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Tissue specimens were prepared in a TMA
format: representative tumor areas were obtained from
FFPE specimens of the primary tumor, and up to three
representative replicate 2-mm cores from multiple tumor
blocks were taken after review and marking of the
hematoxylin and eosin stained slides by board-certified
pathologists (SS and PF). In total, 660 cores were taken
and distributed over 11 slides from 109 patients, all
of whom having pre and post-NACT paired samples.
Staining of HGF was obtained with clone H-10 anti-HGF
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA). Validation
of the antibody was performed in OVCAR-3 cells (no
expressing HGF) and its patupilone resistant counterpart
with high expression of HGF [33]. Additional validation
was performed in tissues using fetal liver as a positive
control. The clone SP44 was chosen to stain c-MET for
the fact that has been selected to enroll patient eligible
for treatment with Rilotumumab in a phase III clinical
trial (http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01697072). A
detailed protocol for staining and analysis is provided in
supplementary methods.

The significance of increased/decreased expression
of a microRNA or a gene (NACT vs. PDS-CT groups)
was calculated using Wilcoxon test and a p value <0.05
as a threshold of significance. The fold increase was
established dividing the value noticed in NACT over that
of PDS-CT, thus meaning that positive and negative values
are related to increase and decrease, respectively. The gene
list of putative targets of microRNAs was prepared using
diverse online softwares including in the microRNA.org
website, such as Targetscan (www.targetscan.org) and
PicTar (http://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/). The list was then
processed using the David software (david.abcc.ncifcrf.
gov/) and further refined using the Genecard database
(http://www.genecards.org) to prioritize genes for which
a targeted agent could be available. The only exceptions
were DICER1 and DROSHA, which were included to test
the hypothesis that NACT changes the expression of the
miRNA processing enzymes. Correlation between microRNAs and target genes was assessed using the Spearman
correlation test, setting the threshold of significance for a
