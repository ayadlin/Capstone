Abstract
Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used for the
treatment of many infectious diseases and has become one of
the major seafood contaminants. Hematologic disorders such
as aplastic anemia and leukemia induced by chloramphenicol
are a major concern. However, the mechanism underlying
chloramphenicol-induced leukemogenesis is not known. By
investigating the effects of chloramphenicol on the activation
of mouse T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody or
staphylococcal enterotoxin B, we found that chloramphenicol
induces the differentiation of activated T cells into lymphoblastic leukemia-like cells, characterized by large cell size,
multiploid nuclei, and expression of CD7, a maker for
immature T cells and T-cell lymphocytic leukemia, thus
phenotypically indicating differentiation toward leukemogenesis. High expression of cyclin B1, but not p53, c-myc, and
CDC25A, was detected in chloramphenicol-treated activated
T cells, which may relate to abnormal cell differentiation.
Chloramphenicol inhibited the activation-induced cell death
of mouse and human T-cell receptor–activated T cells by
down-regulating the expression of Fas ligand. Our findings
show that abnormal cell differentiation and inhibition of
apoptosis may contribute to the development of leukemia
associated with clinical applications of chloramphenicol.

Introduction
Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic originally isolated from
Streptomyces venezuelae in 1947. It has a bactericidal effect on a
broad range of bacteria, as well as Rickettsia, Chlamydia, and
Mycoplasma. Because chloramphenicol is relatively inexpensive to
manufacture, highly effective in combating infections, and able to
pass the blood-brain barrier, it is still widely used in developing
countries (1–6). However, because of its potential toxicity to the
hematopoietic system, chloramphenicol is only occasionally used
in developed countries as a substitutional therapy for some
infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, and Neisseria species. The major side
effects found in patients treated with chloramphenicol include
reversible bone marrow depression, aplastic anemia, and leukemia.
Epidemiologic studies indicate that 1:30,000 to 1:45,000 patients

receiving chloramphenicol treatment go on to develop leukemia.
Recently, chloramphenicol has become one of the major contaminants of farmed shrimps and fish, with some products containing
excessive chloramphenicol residue, raising new concerns about its
toxicity.
Leukemia has been linked to various risk factors, such as
heredity status, chronic virus infection, radiation, chemical
contaminants, and medications. Based on epidemiologic studies,
chloramphenicol has been strongly correlated with leukemogenesis
(7). One research group has successfully induced leukemia in
chloramphenicol-treated toads (8). However, the molecular mechanism through which chloramphenicol induces leukemogenesis is
still unclear. Nevertheless, nitrobenzene is a substituent chemical
moiety in chloramphenicol and nitrobenzene is a long known
carcinogen. It is possible that the transforming ability is related to
the nitrobenzene group of this antibiotic. Pharmacologically,
chloramphenicol reversibly binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit
and prevents the transfer of amino acids during peptide chain
elongation in bacteria. Chloramphenicol also has effects on protein
synthesis in rapidly proliferating but not resting mammalian cells.
Thus, it is possible that leukemia induced by chloramphenicol may
directly change the expression of genes associated with cell cycle
and apoptosis.
Much evidence has shown that the development of leukemia is
related to gene dysregulation. c-myc is a transcriptional factor for
control of cell proliferation, and high expression of c-myc has been
found in leukemia (9, 10). p53 is a tumor suppressor gene, and
mutations causing p53 dysfunction have been detected in patients
with different types of leukemia (11–13). Cyclin B1, which plays a
critical role in the regulation of cell cycle progression, was recently
identified as an oncogene. Overexpression and/or unscheduled
expression of cyclin B1 are always detected in the cells from
leukemia and other tumors (2, 14–19). Accumulating evidence
indicates that CDC25A can be oncogenic, and its overexpression is
frequently shown in a large number of tumors (20–23). Moreover,
leukemia is also considered a disorder of dysregulation of apoptosis
because alterations in Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) expression have
been found in leukemia (24, 25). These data indicate that leukemia
is a multiplex disorder resulting from dysfunction in various genes,
often combined with environmental causes.
To explore the mechanism by which chloramphenicol induces
leukemia development, mouse primary splenocytes were used as a
cell model for morphologic and molecular studies in vitro. Mouse
primary splenocytes were activated with anti-CD3 in the presence
or absence of chloramphenicol for a prolonged time. We found that
chloramphenicol promoted abnormal T-cell differentiation and
allowed the formation of leukemia-like cells, whereas in cultures
without chloramphenicol all cells eventually died and no abnormal
cells were found. These cells survived in culture for months. They
expressed high levels of cyclin B1 and very low level of FasL.
In addition, these abnormal cells also expressed high level of CD7,

a hallmark of immature lymphoblastic leukemia. Therefore, this
finding for the first time provides direct evidence that chloramphenicol induces leukemogenesis in mammalian T cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and stimulators in vitro. Spleens were taken from 6- to
8-week-old BALB/c mice and pulverized between two autoclaved grass
slides in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), and a single-cell suspension was obtained
by passing through a 40-Am-diameter nylon mesh (BD Biosciences). The
cells were washed twice in RPMI 1640 and then cultured at 2  106 to 5 
106 per mL density in complete RPMI 1640, containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, 10% L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Antibody against CD3
(145-2c-11) at 2.5 Ag/mL or staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB; SigmaAldrich) at 5 Ag/mL was used to activate T cells in the presence or absence
of chloramphenicol at 500 Ag/mL for 1 week. The cells were then
maintained in complete RPMI 1640 with interlekin-2 (IL-2) at 50 to
100 units/mL for cell survival studies. Cell differentiation and morphologic
changes were observed by light microscopy.
Cell staining. For morphologic study, cell smears were prepared by
spreading of cultured cells on a glass slide and allowing them to air dry. The
Giemsa reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to stain the cells according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cellular morphologic characteristics were examined under light microscopy. For immunofluorescence staining, freshly
cultured cells were washed twice in ice-cold staining buffer (1 PBS with
2% fetal bovine serum and 0.01% sodium azide). Cell staining was carried
out in the same staining buffer with FITC-conjugated anti-CD3 (eBioscience) and anti-CD7 plus phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-goat IgG
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) following the supplier’s protocols. After washing

twice with cold staining buffer, the cells were mounted with ProLong
antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) and covered with a glass coverslip.
Fluorescence was analyzed under a Nikon fluorescence inverted microscope
(Eclipse TE 2000-S, Nikon).
Flow cytometric analysis. Human T-cell lines Jurkat and Jcam (kind
gifts of Dr. Gordon Mills, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) were
activated by ionomycin at 100 nmol/L each in culture medium and mouse
T-cell lines A1.1 and IE5 in plates coated with anti-CD3 at 2.5 Ag/mL.
Different concentrations of chloramphenicol were added with the
stimulators as indicated. After incubation at 37jC for overnight, the cells
were harvested and washed twice with cold 1 PBS. The cell pellets
were then resuspended in propidium iodide staining buffer (1 PBS with
20 Ag/mL propidium iodide, 0.2% saponin, and 50 Ag/mL RNase) and
incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Flow cytometry analysis was
carried out with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Cell cycle distribution is
indicated by DNA content revealed by propidium iodide staining. After
gating out cell fragments, the population of sub-G0 phase on the histogram
plot represents apoptotic cells. For cell surface marker testing, the mouse
cell line IE5 was stimulated with and without anti-CD3 in the presence or
absence of chloramphenicol at 500 Ag/mL. After incubation at 37jC for 6 h,
the cells were harvested and washed twice with cold staining buffer. The
FITC-conjugated anti-Fas antibody and PE-conjugated anti-FasL antibodies
(BD Biosciences) were used for cell surface staining and analyzed by flow
cytometry.
Northern blot. Mouse splenocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3 in the
presence or absence of chloramphenicol at 500 Ag/mL for 1 week. Total
RNA was extracted using TriPure reagent and its protocol (Roche). RNA
(20 Ag) of each sample was separated on a 1% denaturing formaldehyde
agarose gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham

Biosciences). The membrane was repeatedly hybridized with [32P]dCTPlabeled probes for cyclin B1, p53, c-myc, and CDC25A. Glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as an internal quantitative
control.
Regulatory T-cell population. BALB/c mouse splenocytes were
stimulated with anti-CD3 alone (2.5 Ag/mL) or plus chloramphenicol
(500 Ag/mL) in complete RPMI 1640 for 1 week. The population of
CD4+CD25+ cells was measured by flow cytometric analysis after staining
with FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 and PE-conjugated anti-CD25 (eBioscience).
FoxP3 expression in CD4+CD25+ cells was further analyzed by real-time
quantitative PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
The primer sequences were the following: TTCATGCATCAGCTCTCCAC
(sense) and CTGGACACCCATTCCAGACT (antisense). GAPDH expression
was analyzed simultaneously as an internal quantitative control.

Results
Chloramphenicol promotes abnormal differentiation of
leukemic cells. The most suspected transformations induced by
chloramphenicol are acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute
myelogenous leukemia, both of which are derived from proliferating cells. Because our preliminary experiments with in vitro
culture of mouse splenocytes with chloramphenicol alone did not
produce abnormal cells, no matter what concentration of
chloramphenicol was used or how long the cultures were
maintained, we believe that the effect of chloramphenicol is
exerted on proliferating cells. Epidemiologic study of chloramphenicol-induced leukemia has shown that it is always related to a
history of bacterial infection. We thus believe that some bacterial
superantigens, such as SEB, may work synergistically with
chloramphenicol by inducing T-cell proliferation. In these proliferating cells, chloramphenicol may promote abnormal differentiation by altering the expression of some cell cycle–related and
apoptosis-related genes. By stimulating mouse splenocyte with
anti-CD3 or SEB in the presence or absence of chloramphenicol for
1 week, we found that chloramphenicol at 400 to 600 Ag/mL

resulted in the appearance in culture of many large cells, which
were not present in control cultures activated without chloramphenicol or treated with chloramphenicol alone (Fig. 1A). These
abnormal cells were morphologically similar to leukemic cells,
characterized by very large cell size and multiploid nuclei. The
same cultured cells were also analyzed for DNA content with
propidium iodide staining. The results show that chloramphenicol
not only induces additional mitosis, as indicated by the high
diploid peak, but also results in many multiploid cells, changes that
were identical to those revealed by microscopy (Fig. 1B ).
Significantly, when we continued to culture the chloramphenicoltreated activated T cells supplemented with IL-2 for up to a month,
many large cells continued to survive (Fig. 2A), whereas all cells
activated in the absence of chloramphenicol died off (Fig. 2B).
Furthermore, by immunofluorescence staining, we found that all of
the surviving cells express CD3 and only the large cells also express
CD7, a marker of immature T leukemic cells (Fig. 2C and D). This
phenotypic change may represent a differentiation process toward
leukemogenesis. Taken together, these results show that chloramphenicol induces abnormal cell differentiation to leukemia-like
cells.
Overexpression of cyclin B causes abnormal cell differentiation. The precise execution of cell cycle events is tightly
controlled by concerted activation and inhibition of the expression
of various genes and the activities of their products (10, 26–28).
Dysregulation of critical genes in this process leads to abnormal
cell proliferation and differentiation. To understand the mechanism
of chloramphenicol-mediated abnormal cell differentiation, we
analyzed the expression of several cell cycle–related genes. We
found that the expression of cyclin B1 is dramatically increased in
cells treated with anti-CD3 and chloramphenicol, whereas the
expression of other genes, such as p53, CDC25A, and c-myc, was not
significantly altered (Fig. 3). Because cyclin B1 regulates the
transition in the mitosis phase of the cell cycle, overexpression of

CD3 and CD7 markers and survive longer. Cells were
cultured as described in Materials and Methods. Most
cells stimulated in the presence of chloramphenicol
are still alive and appear healthy after 1 mo (A),
whereas cells stimulated with anti-CD3 alone
completely died out (B). Among surviving cells
in the chloramphenicol cultures, all cells expressed
CD3 (C ) and only larger cells expressed CD7,
an immature T-cell marker (D ), as determined by
immunofluorescence and flow cytometry.

Figure 3. Chloramphenicol induces high cyclin
B1 expression. The expression of cyclin B1, p53,
c-myc, and CDC25A was analyzed by Northern
blotting in splenocytes treated by anti-CD3
antibody in the presence or absence of
chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicol significantly
induced overexpression of cyclin B1, but not p53,
c-myc, and CDC25A. GAPDH served as an internal
quantitative control.

cyclin B1 may result in excessive nuclear division and the
formation of leukemic cells with multiploid nuclei. It has been
shown that treatment of cancer cells with butyrolactone I causes
accumulation of cyclin B1 and formation of cells with multiple
nuclei (29). Even in plants, when a nondegradable cyclin B1 is
expressed, it also causes defective G2-M and increase in cells with
multiple nuclei (30).
Chloramphenicol inhibits activation-induced cell death.
Activation-induced cell death (AICD) is a key mechanism for
maintaining cellular homeostasis during lymphocyte development,
immune responses, and tumorigenesis. Although mouse splenocytes at rest do not proliferate, they do exhibit dramatic
proliferation potential following stimulation of anti-CD3 or SEB.

Previously activated T cells will undergo apoptosis after reactivation. This apoptosis, however, can be significantly inhibited by
chloramphenicol in our experiment. We found that activation of
chloramphenicol-treated cells displays much less apoptosis than
cells treated with anti-CD3 alone (Fig. 4A). To further confirm this
finding as a universal biological phenomenon, different concentrations of chloramphenicol were also applied to inhibit AICD in
the human T-cell lines Jurkat and Jcam as well as the mouse T-cell
hybridomas A1.1 and IE5. As shown in Fig. 4B and C ,
chloramphenicol clearly blocked AICD in all four cell lines,
although these cells were activated by different stimuli. Our data
show that chloramphenicol not only promotes abnormal differentiation of splenocytes into leukemia-like cells but also promotes the

of chloramphenicol, as indicated. DNA content was determined by flow cytometric analysis after staining with propidium iodide. The sub-G0 population (M1 ) represents
apoptotic cells. A, chloramphenicol significantly inhibited AICD compared with the cells stimulated with anti-CD3 in the absence of chloramphenicol. Mouse T-cell
lines A1.1 and IE5 were stimulated with anti–CD3-coated plates, and human T-cell lines Jurkat and Jcam were stimulated by ionomycin (100 nmol/L). Different
concentrations of chloramphenicol were added to the culture, as indicated. Apoptosis was examined by DNA content as in A. B, the inhibition of apoptosis by
chloramphenicol correlated well with its concentration. C, the effect of chloramphenicol on AICD in IE5 cells is representative.

survival of these cells by inhibiting apoptosis. We believe that these
two properties of chloramphenicol could be key to its leukemiainducing potential.
Chloramphenicol blocks FasL expression induced by T-cell
receptor activation. AICD in T cells is mediated by induction of
the expression of Fas and FasL and their subsequent interaction.
Blocking this interaction with TR6, Fas fusion protein, or
monoclonal antibodies against FasL can completely prevent
AICD (31). Because chloramphenicol is believed to affect
mitochondrial protein synthesis, we examined whether the effect
of chloramphenicol on AICD is exerted through an effect on
cytochrome c or the Fas pathway. We found that chloramphenicol did not change cytochrome c levels and did not inhibit
apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody. Because AICD is largely
dependent on the Fas-FasL pathway, these results indicate that
chloramphenicol inhibits AICD at a step before activation of the
Fas receptor. To understand the molecular mechanism by which
chloramphenicol inhibits apoptosis, we examined changes in Fas
and FasL expression in chloramphenicol-treated cells by
immunofluorescence cell staining and flow cytometry. We found
that the high expression of FasL stimulated by anti-CD3
antibody is completely inhibited by chloramphenicol. However,
chloramphenicol does not seem to affect Fas expression (Fig. 5).
Therefore, chloramphenicol must inhibit AICD by blocking FasL
expression. Our result shows that the molecular mechanism of
chloramphenicol-mediated inhibition of apoptosis is by blocking
FasL expression.
Chloramphenicol promotes a more regulatory T-cell
population. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are potent modulators of
immune responses (32–35). Various studies indicate that Tregs
are immunosuppressive. Animals with depleted Tregs spontaneously develop various T-cell–mediated autoimmune diseases (36).
Transfusion of Tregs inhibits lethal graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) in bone marrow transplantation (33). Because activation
of the T-cell receptor (TCR) can induce T-cell differentiation,

including a population of CD4+CD25+ cells, we examined what
would occur in the presence of chloramphenicol. We found that
splenocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 in the presence
of chloramphenicol had significantly more CD4+CD25+ cells
(Fig. 6A). Moreover, expression of the transcription forkhead box
P3 factor (FoxP3) was also significantly higher than in the
controls (Fig. 6B). Thus, chloramphenicol promotes more Treg
differentiation, which may act to suppress possible immune
responses against leukemic cells and thus allow the development
of leukemia.

Discussion
It has been known for more than 15 years that there is a link
between the use of chloramphenicol and the development of
leukemia (37, 38). However, the molecular mechanism for
leukemogenesis induced by chloramphenicol is largely unknown.
Because chloramphenicol is still popularly used as an effective
treatment for many bacterial infections in developing countries,
or as a substitutional therapy for drug-resistant bacteria in
developed countries, a clear understanding of the mechanism of
leukemogenesis induced by chloramphenicol would be of benefit
to the development of new drugs and to human health
worldwide. In addition, the current increase in the use of
chloramphenicol in seafood farming and its associated concerns
to human health also demand a better understanding of the
toxicology of this antibiotic. In this report, we present evidence
that chloramphenicol induces leukemia-like cells in activated T
cells by promoting abnormal cell differentiation and inhibiting
activation-induced apoptosis.
Leukemia is a type of blood cancer characterized by a large
number of abnormal or immature cells in the bloodstream. Unlike
most blood cells, the malignant cells tend to multiply and live for a
longer time, thus leading to accumulation within the body.
However, the mechanisms through which most leukemias develop

stimulated by anti-CD3 with or without
chloramphenicol. The expression of
Fas and FasL was detected by
immunofluorescence staining and flow
cytometry. Anti-CD3 stimulation induced
high FasL expression, but the presence
of chloramphenicol significantly inhibited
its expression.

and Methods. A, CD4+CD25+ cells were detected by

staining. B, FoxP3 expression in CD4+CD25+ cells

are still not known. It is well known that cancer cells frequently
arise in the body but they normally die by suicide through
apoptosis or by fratricide through immune recognition before they
accumulate in significant numbers. Therefore, leukemia development is closely related to two key events: unrestrained proliferation
and enhanced survival. By using mouse splenocytes as an
experimental model in vitro, we showed that chloramphenicol
combined with mitogenic stimuli significantly induces the
formation of leukemia-like cells, characterized by large cell size,
multiploid nuclei, and especially the expression of CD7, a marker
for immature T cells and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia.
The cell phenotypic changes are associated with aberrant
expression of cyclin B1, which helps control cell mitosis. It has
been shown in other cell systems that overexpression of cyclin
B1 promotes the transformation of cells with a multiploid nuclei
(39, 40), a mechanism very likely also operative in inducing the
multiploid cellular phenotype in our experimental system.
Another cellular modification required for leukemogenesis is
that the malignant cells must escape apoptosis and avoid attack
by the immune system. We show that chloramphenicol is also a
potent inhibitor of activation-induced apoptosis, which is
efficient in primary cells as well as cell lines of human and
mouse. This property of chloramphenicol has not been revealed
previously and we believe that it plays a critical role in
chloramphenicol-induced leukemogenesis by allowing proliferating cells to continuously survive. Furthermore, we showed that
the molecular mechanism of chloramphenicol inhibition of
apoptosis is through blocking of FasL expression. Therefore, it
is likely that the cellular changes associated with chloramphenicol make leukemic-like cells more likely to survive long-term
and develop into clinical leukemia.
Chloramphenicol had been a popular antibiotic before realizing
that it could cause aplastic anemia. It is now also believed to be a

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

carcinogen based on limited evidence of carcinogenicity from
clinical studies in humans. Three case reports have shown the
development of leukemia after chloramphenicol therapy. In a casecontrol study in China, Shu and colleagues (37, 38) found increased
risks of childhood leukemia, which correlated with the number of
days chloramphenicol was administered. Two case-control studies
revealed high, but nonsignificant, increases in the risk of aplastic
anemia associated with the use of chloramphenicol (41, 42).
However, other studies found no association between the use of
chloramphenicol and the development of adult leukemia (43, 44).
Interestingly, chloramphenicol also induced leukemia in toads (8).
When mice were treated with busulfan and chloramphenicol, they
develop transplantable T-cell leukemia, providing clear evidence
that chloramphenicol can indeed induce leukemia in T cells (45).
Therefore, the evidence of a link between aplastic anemia and
leukemia, and the increased risk of leukemia found in some casecontrol studies supports the conclusion that chloramphenicol
exposure is associated with an increased malignancy risk in
humans.
Immune surveillance also has an important role in killing
malignant cells. Recent studies have shown that T-cell leukemia,
such as that induced by human T-cell lymphotrophic virus,
possesses a Treg phenotype. Tregs are potent modulators of
immune responses (32–35). Various studies indicate that Tregs are
hyporesponsive and suppressive. Animals with depleted Tregs
spontaneously develop variable T-cell–mediated autoimmune
diseases (36). Transfusion of Tregs inhibits lethal GVHD in bone
marrow transplantation (33). Because activation of the TCR can
induce cell differentiation, including populations of CD4+CD25+
cell, we examined what would occur in the presence of
chloramphenicol. We found that splenocytes stimulated with
anti-CD3 in the presence of chloramphenicol had significantly
more CD4+CD25+ cells. Moreover, expression of the transcription

forkhead box P3 factor FoxP3 was also significantly higher than in
the controls. Thus, chloramphenicol promotes more Treg differentiation, which may act to suppress possible immune responses
against leukemic cells.
In conclusion, we have shown a molecular mechanism of
chloramphenicol-induced leukemia, resulting from overexpression
of cyclin B1 during cell differentiation and down-regulation of
FasL expression, thus preventing apoptosis. Disruption of normal
immune responses by developing a Treg phenotype may also
promote leukemogenesis by down-regulating the immune surveillance mechanisms.

SOCIETY

(2) On Monday

night,

June

22, a lecture

by

Dr. L. W. Alvarez on meson physics has been tentative
ly scheduled. On Tuesday night, June 23, Dr. L. H.
Gray of the Hammersmith Hospital, London, will speak
on a topic to be announced. Dr. Gray's lecture is spon
sored by the Iowa Branch of the American Cancer Soci

ety. Those desiring to report original research in radia
tion effects, or interested in attending or desiring addi
tional information, please contact the Secretary of the
Society, Dr. A. Edelmann, Biology Department, Brook
haven National Laboratory, Upton, L.I., New York.

ERRATUM

The following correction should be made in the arti
cle by Beck and Valentine, â€œThe
Aerobic Carbohydrate
Metabolism
Glycolysis
substitute

of Leukocytes
in Health and Leukemia.
I.
and Respiration,â€•
November,
1952, page 821;
for the last paragraph:

The data in Table 3 permit several interesting calcu
lations.

If one compares

the amount

of glucose

actually

disappearing with the sum of the amount equivalent to
lactic

acid

produced

plus

that

equivalent

to 02 con

by the glucose utilized by 16 per cent in CLL. If the as
sumption is made that, in this respect, the myeloid and
lymphoid celLsof leukemia are similar to those of nor
ma! blood, it may be that the computed

normal figure

represents a summation of the myeloid (M) and
lymphoid (L) cells that make up the normal leukocyte
population.

Thus,

if M = +0.27

and

L = â€”0.16 and

the normal differential is 65 per cent M and So per cent
L, then

0.65 (+0.27)
+ 0.35 (â€”0.16) = +0.12
sumption, it is seen that the amount of glucose â€œcleav
age productsâ€•exceeds the amount of glucose utilized b
a figure identical to the observed +0.12 for normal
12 per cent in N and 27 per cent in CML and is exceeded leukocytes.
