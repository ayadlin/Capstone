ABSTRACT
Although the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab has revolutionized the treatment of
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), resistance to treatment still existed. Thus, strategies
for suppressing Rituximab-resistant NHLs are urgently needed. Here, an anti-CD20
nanocluster (ACNC) is successfully constructed from its type I and type II mAb
(Rituximab and 11B8). These distinct anti-CD20 mAbs are mass grafted to a short
chain polymer (polyethylenimine). Compared with parental Rituximab and 11B8, the
ACNC had a reduced “off-rate”. Importantly, ACNC efficiently inhibited Rituximabresistant lymphomas in both disseminated and localized human NHL xenograft
models. Further results revealed that ACNC is significantly potent in inducing caspasedependent apoptosis and lysosome-mediated programmed cell death (PCD). This
may help explain why ACNC is effective in suppressing rituximab-resistant lymphoma
while Rituximab and 11B8 are not. Additionally, ACNC experienced low clearance from
peripheral blood and high intratumor accumulation. This improved pharmacokinetics
is attributed to the antibody-antigen reaction (active targeting) and enhanced
permeability and retention (ERP) effect (passive targeting). This study suggested
that ACNC might be a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of rituximab-resistant
lymphomas.

Up to now, at least 3 major mechanistic pathways
have been proposed by which anti-CD20 mAb causes
B-cell depletion, including complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC) and induction of programmed cell
death (PCD) [3]. Anti-CD20 mAbs are often defined
as either type I or II mAbs based on their ability to
redistribute CD20 into lipid rafts. Most anti-CD20 mAbs
described in the literature are Type I mAbs (Rituximablike), which stabilize CD20 in lipid rafts and induce
CDC, but only weakly induce PCD. In contrast, Type II
(Tositumomab-like) mAbs do not localize CD20 into
lipid rafts and only weakly induce CDC, but appear to
induce higher levels of PCD. In addition, both types are
comparable in carrying out ADCC [2, 3, 5, 8].

INTRODUCTION
Rituximab (Rtx), the first US FDA (Food and Drug
Administration)-approved mAb for treating B-cell nonHodgkin lymphomas (NHL), targets the CD20 antigen and
leads to CD20+ B-cell depletion [1–3]. Currently, Rituximab
is used in all phases of conventional treatment, including
first-line therapy, maintenance, and salvage therapy [4, 5].
Although its clinical effectiveness is uncontested, the
effectiveness of Rituximab is ultimately limited partly due
to treatment resistance [5, 6]. Only 40% of patients who
initially respond to Rituximab will respond again after
relapse [7]. Thus, developing novel methods against
Rituximab resistance with improved outcome is urgently
needed.

Although all mechanisms mentioned above might
be involved in providing therapeutic efficacy, their
relative contributions remain unclear [5, 9]. Considering
the complex effector mechanisms of Rituximab, the
exact mechanisms of Rituximab resistance remain poorly
understood. Based on previous publications, the following
potential mechanisms might contribute to the resistance:
(1) loss of CD20 expression, either through down-regulation
or “shaving” of Rituximab/CD20 complexes [10,  11];
(2) exhaustion of effector cells, such as natural killer (NK)
cells, etc. [12–14]; (3) host immunologic factors, such as
Fc receptor polymorphisms [15–17]; (4) exhaustion of
stored complements or increased surface expression of
complement control proteins [18–20].
Nowadays, to combat Rituximab resistance, many
researches are focusing on the combination therapy
of Rituximab with different mAbs. Chao et al’s study
revealed that anti-CD47 antibodies preferentially enabled
phagocytosis of NHL cells and synergized with Rituximab
through Fc receptor (FcR)-dependent and -independent
stimulation of phagocytosis. Thus the combination therapy
led to elimination of lymphoma [21]. Phase I/II studies
show that either epratuzumab (a  humanized  antibody
targeting the B cell antigen CD22) or galiximab
(a chimeric antibody targeting the costimulatory
ligand CD80) in combination with Rituximab demonstrate
relative safety. The clinical responses are greater than that
of single agent [22–24]. Previously, we constructed an
IgG-like bispecific fusion protein targeting both CD20
and Flt3 (CD20-Flex BiFP) and a bispecific mAb targeting
both CD20 and HLA-DR (CD20-243 CrossMab) through
CrossMab technology, both of which exhibited excellent
anti-lymphoma activities [25, 26].
In this study, we successfully constructed an antiCD20 mAb nanocluster (ACNC) from two different
anti-CD20 mAbs, type I mAb Rituximab and type II
mAb 11B8. It should be mentioned that nanomedicine
is an emerging form of anti-cancer therapy based on
the assembling of biological molecules into nano-sized
particles [27, 28]. Our experimental results indicate that
this nanocluster exhibits strong antitumor activity against
Rituximab-resistant B-cell lymphoma. Further results
reveal that this nanocluster can induce exceptional potent
PCD through both a caspase-dependent and -independent
pathway. Moreover, the inter-cell link with ACNC was
observed in this study, which was considered to be
related with its enhanced PCD evoking ability. Our mAb
nanocluster may be a promising strategy for treating
Rituximab-resistant B-cell lymphomas.

also confirmed in another system). Its high molecular
weight (MW) of nanocluster was confirmed by SDSPAGE (Figure 1D). An obviously stranded protein band
of ACNC appeared in lane C-D. On the other hand,
no band of polymer in lane A-B and a single band at
approximately 150 kDa of unmodified Rituximab and
11B8 respectively in lane E and F. The results were
further validated by dynamic light scattering analysis,
which showed a mean radius of approximately 176 nm
for ACNC, compared with less than 7 nm for Rituximab
and 11B8 (Figure 1E).

Binding avidity of ACNC
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the
exposure of Raji cells to Alexa Fluor-488 labeled
Rituximab or Alexa Fluor-647 labeled 11B8 led to
decoration of the cell surface with corresponding green
or red fluorescence. The exposure to ACNC consisting
of both mAbs led to both green and red fluorescence
(Figure  2A), which indicated that the bio-recognition
between ACNC and CD20 was not affected during the
process of fabrication.
The binding “off-rate” experiment was performed
to compare the dissociation of ACNC with free mAbs
from Raji cells. As shown in Figure 2B, approximately
52.2 ± 3.1% of the ACNC remained on Raji cells after
a 24-hour incubation with antibody free culture medium,
compared with 14.5 ± 0.1% of Rituximab (**p = 0.001),
33.9 ± 1.4% of 11B8 (**p = 0.002), and 24.6 ± 1.5% of
Rituximab + 11B8 (**p = 0.001). These results indicated
that 11B8 (type II) owned a reduced “off-rate” compared
with Rituximab (Type I) (**p = 0.005). Besides, the
ACNC nanocluster showed a much slower “off-rate”
than unmodified Rituximab and 11B8 due to the effective
crosslink.

Rituximab-resistant Raji cells failed to
respond to Rituximab-induced CDC but
not ADCC in vitro
The ability of Rituximab to mediate CDC, ADCC
and PCD in resistant clones was subsequently evaluated
after the successful generation of Rituximab resistant
lymphoma cells (Raji-anti). We further compared it with
the WT cells (named as Raji). As shown in Figure 3A,
Raji cells exhibited high sensitivity to the cytotoxic
effects of Rituximab-mediated CDC. This effect was
stepwise augmented by the concentration of Rituximab.
Compared with Raji cells, the resistant cells were less
sensitive to Rituximab-mediated CDC in all the three
tested concentrations (**p = 0.005). However, both of the
WT and resistant cells exhibited comparable sensitivity
to Rituximab-mediated ADCC (Figure 3B). Besides,
Rituximab hardly evoked obvious PCD in WT and
resistant Raji clones (Figure 3C).

survival time (MST) of respectively 28 ± 10.28 and
36 ± 7.12 days. Combination therapy of Rituximab and
11B8 can moderately extend the MST to 56 ± 6.33 days
(*p = 0.034). However, the mice treated with ACNC had
a significantly extended MST of more than 120 days, with
statistically significant survival extension by log-rank
analysis (**p = 0.01) comparing with the combination
therapy of both antibodies. Also, 5/10 mice experienced a
complete remission (CR) in ACNC treated group.
The excellent anti-tumor activity of ACNC is
validated in a localized model. For the WT lymphomas,
Figure 4C revealed that the groups treated by Rituximab ±
11B8 resulted in decreased rate of lymphoma growth.
However, the tumor volume of mice treated by ACNC
was remarkably suppressed, which was characterized
by 3/4 mice of CR having no measurable mass. For the

demonstrated a remarkable decrease in tumor burden

In the disseminated model, Raji and Raji-anti cells
were respectively transplanted intravenously into female
SCID mice via tail vein. After 5 days, these mice were
randomly administered injections of PBS, free Rituximab,
Rituximab + 11B8 and ACNC weekly for 3 times. The
survival curve is shown in Figure 4A-4B and the results of
statistical analysis are shown in Table S1-S2. For the WT
Raji cells, the group treated by Rituximab had significantly
long survival time than the control group injected by PBS
(*p = 0.008). Similar results were seen with combination
therapy of Rituximab plus 11B8 (**p = 0.007) and were
not statistically different compared to single injection of
Rituximab (p = 0.494). However, the administration of
ACNC can significantly prolong the survival time with
a CR percentage of 6/10 indicated by long-term survival
(> 120 days post treatment). For the resistant clones, no
statistical difference in survival was observed between

Involvement of lysosomes in ACNC induced
PCD in resistant lymphoma cells

ACNC mediated cell death in resistant
lymphoma cells in in vitro experiments

Previous studies revealed that lysosome plays an
important role in type II anti-CD20 mAb induced PCD
[37]. In order to characterize the involvement of lysosomes
in ACNC induced PCD, lysosome tracker was used to
label the targeting resistant cells (Figure 6A). FCM results
revealed that the distribution of FL-2 (lyso-tracker) in
Raji-anti cells experienced a visible red shift, including
increase and decrease of red fluorescence intensity, after a
16-hour-incubation with 11B8 (blue histograms) and ACNC
(red histograms) compared to NT group (orange histograms)
or Rituximab treatment (green histograms). CLSM images
results (Figure 6B) clearly explained this discrepancy,
which revealed that in normal cells, cellular lysosomes
were labeled as relatively small and confined organelles,
while after 11B8 or ACNC treatment, an enlargement of

In order to clarify the exact mechanisms of excellent
in vivo tumor-inhibitory effect of ACNC on Rituximabresistant lymphoma, we performed in vitro experiments
to testify the CDC, ADCC and PCD inducing ability of
ACNC. As indicated in Figure 5A, for the high CDC
resistance, ACNC and its parental antibodies appeared
to be ineffective in inducing CDC in Raji-anti clones.
In contrast, their ability to mediate ADCC was not
affected (Figure 5B). Figure 5C demonstrated that the
Annexin V+ subsets induced by free Rituximab and
11B8 was respectively 9.43 ± 1.80% and 22.81 ± 0.65%
in Rituximab-resistant Raji cells. However, the

fluorescence in the cytoplasm was detected. Considering
previous publications [37, 38], we believed these cells
were successively undergoing a swelling of lysosomes
(enlargement of red fluorescence labeled compartments)
and the collapse of lysosomal compartment (diffusion of
red fluorescence in the cytoplasm).

For further validation of lysosome compartment
collapse, we performed IF staining for cathepsin B,
which is known as a lysosomal component (Figure 6C).

in cathepsin B (red fluorescence) was found throughout
the cytoplasm of ACNC treated cells, in accordance with
the results of lysosome tracker labeling.

Involvement of caspase activation in ACNC
induced PCD

(HA)  [36], which we thought can contribute to ACNC
induced PCD as discussed in the following section.

For the determination of caspase involvement in
ACNC induced PCD, the mitochondrial depolarization
was firstly evaluated by FCM post JC-1 staining, cells
undergone mitochondrial depolarization was indicated
by decreased fluorescence intensity in FL-2 (JC-1 red).
As shown in Figure 6D, neither free Rituximab nor 11B8
can cause significant changes in mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP), while ACNC treated cells experienced
a remarkable mitochondrial depolarization in resistant
Raji cells.
In accordance, Figure 6E revealed that the
caspase can hardly be activated by free anti-CD20
mAbs in Raji-anti cells. However, a significant increase
of caspase activation appeared as a result of ACNC
treatment compared with the combination treatment of
free parental antibodies (**p = 0.002). PCD inhibition
results (Figure 6F) revealed that ZVAD-FMK (a caspases
inhibitor) over a range of concentrations from 10 to
30  μM can hardly prevent free antibody-induced PCD.
While ACNC evoked PCD can be significantly but not
completely reduced by ZVAD-FMK (**p = 0.001). These
results clearly demonstrate that ACNC can successfully
induce PCD via both a caspase dependent and independent
manner in resistant lymphoma cells.

Pharmacokinetics assays
For pharmacokinetics (PK) assays, onecompartment model was used to describe the time
course of blood concentrations. The PK parameters
was demonstrated in Table 1, which revealed that the
elimination of ACNC from mouse peripheral blood is
much slower than that of free antibodies, with a slower
clearance (CL) (ACNC: 7.49 ± 1.01L/h versus Rituximab
12.13 ± 2.04L/h and 11B8 11.83 ± 0.84L/h, **p = 0.001)
and longer elimination half-time (t1/2) (ACNC:
429.0 ± 37.6H versus Rituximab 274.8 ± 30.1 h and 11B8
278.4 ± 9.0 h, **p = 0.001).

In vivo distribution
Lymphoma (Daudi-anti) bearing mice were
administrated tail vein injection of ACNC and free mAbs.
After 24 hours, mice were sacrificed and the major organs,
including tumor, brain, blood, heart, kidney, liver and
spleen, were assayed for mAb concentration, which is
expressed as μg/g (mAb/tissue) and graphically presented
in Figure 7A. Significant increases in the accumulation
of ACNC were observed compared with free Rituximab
(*p = 0.023) and 11B8 (*p = 0.013). Moreover, the kidney
concentration of ACNC experienced a significantly
decrease compared with free Rituximab (*p  = 0.014)
and 11B8 (*p = 0.045). The drug concentration of
ACNC seems to be lower than free antibodies in all
the other organs, although no statistical difference was
found. Additionally, the frozen sections of tumor tissues
were prepared for IF staining and observed by CLSM
(Figure 7B). In keeping with the ELISA results, the tumor
accumulation of ACNC was significantly increased with
much higher green color.

Inter-cellular clusters may play an important
role in ACNC induced PCD in resistant
lymphoma cells
Our previous observations (the work the mass
arrayed antibodies can evoke  that  will be submitted soon)
have found large inter-cellular clusters than free antibodies.
In order to confirm this interesting phenomenon, Raji-anti
cells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml anti-CD20 mAbs or
ACNCs. As displRituximab  post  observed  were  small
cell-clusters  ayed in Figure 6G, few treatment compared
with some larger ones post 11B8 treatment. Surprisingly,
the largest inter-cellular clusters appeared among cells
as treated by the mAb nanocluster. This obvious intercellular cell clusters was similar to Homotypic Adhesion

DISCUSSION
Although the clinical effectiveness of Rituximab is
uncontested, a significant number of patients gradually

become unresponsive after repeat treatment. The
phenomenon was termed as rituximab resistance, which is
one of the biggest challenges to solve in the clinic [5, 6].
As we all know, cancer is usually multifactorial in nature,
involving various redundant disease-mediating ligands
and receptors, as well as crosstalk between signal cascades
[39,  40]. Thus, targeting only one or two pathways may not
completely shut off a hallmark capability of cancer. This
allows some malignant cells to survive until they or their
progeny eventually adapt to the selective pressure [25, 26].
Therefore, the activation of multiple tumor suppression
pathways may result in improved therapeutic efficacy
and reduce drug resistance. Moreover, the combination of
different antibodies should be better than single antibody.
In this study, we successfully constructed
an anti-CD20 antibody nanocluster (ACNC) from
Rituximab (type I) and 11B8 (type II). The details of
the construction were shown in Figure 1. Shortly, this
cluster formed by ACNC can bind to surface CD20 of
lymphoma cells with affinity similar to that of parental
antibodies. It is known that both the PEI and antibody are
hydrophilic macromolecules. It is known that hydrophilic
macromolecule will be in a coil state in aqueous solution.
A hydration layer will thus form and surround the
polymer coil, which contribute to its stability [41]. For the
ACNC nanocluster, its stability is also dominated by this
hydration layer in the physiological environments. On the
other hand, its binding “off-rate” significantly reduced
because of efficient cross-linking by PEI polymer, which
may contribute to its long-lasting anti-tumor activity. The
“off-rate” reflects the binding ability of the antibodies.
For the ACNC, many mABs were arrayed along one
single polymer chain. The linking of the mAbs with
each other increased the size of ACNC. The larger size
will lead to the higher possibility of mAb binding with
the antigens on the cellular surface. This consequently
hampered the neighboring mAb disassociation from the
cellular surface, which thus reduced the disassociate
constant of antibody resulting in low off-rate.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In order to determine the anti-tumor efficacy
against Rituximab resistance lymphomas, Rituximab
resistant cell lines were generated from wild type cells by
exposing to fresh human serum and stepwise increased
concentrations of Rituximab. The experimental results
revealed that the Raji-anti clones were unresponsive to
Rituximab mediated CDC but not ADCC. As evaluated
by the Rituximab sensitive Raji cells (Raji), we can find
that the percentage of lysed cells treated by Rituxmab was
about 85%. This value decreased to ~ 60% when Raji cells
were treated by ACNC at the same conditions. Such CDC
was almost not affected by this chemical crosslink in the
right part in Figure 5 A because the data was obtained in
the Rituximab resistant Raji cells (Raji-anti). However,
the modification of Fc fragments had little effects on the
ADCC function, which was shown in Figure 5B. The
similar results were also reported in others’ work [42].
Previous studies suggested that the up-regulation of
complement regulation proteins (CRPs) such as CD55 and
CD59 on surface of lymphoma cells inhibits the activation
of complement systems, which might be the main cause of
resistant cells’ unresponsiveness to Rituximab mediated
CDC in vitro [43, 44]. However, the mechanism of
Rituximab resistance in vivo is much more complex. The
exhaustion and disability of complement and effector cells
as well as host immunologic factors (such as Fc receptor
polymorphisms) may limit the efficacy of Fc related
ADCC and CDC evoked by Rituximab [12–20]. The PCD
inducing ability was not independent of Fc fragments
and limited complement and effector cells. So enhancing
PCD inducing ability might be an effective strategy for
suppressing Rituximab-resistant lymphomas.
In vivo studies illustrated that ACNC was more
effective than free mAbs in curing both wild type and
rituximab-resistant B cell lymphomas in both disseminated
and localized human NHL Xeno-transplant models.
Subsequently, we carried out experiments to clarify the
tumor suppressing mechanisms against resistant NHLs. As
shown in Figure 5, our experimental results indicated that

although resistant Raji cells are unresponsive to anti-CD20
mAb mediated CDC, ACNC can mediate exceptional
potent PCD in rituximab resistant lymphoma cells in vitro.
As for the enhanced PCD inducing ability, the lysosome
leakage mediated by 11B8 (type II) undoubtedly plays an
important role. But even more important is the caspase
activation mediated by the efficient crossilink of CD20
antibody-antigen complex, which can only be realized by
a secondary antibody in ex vivo but not in vivo experiments
previously [2, 3, 45]. Interestingly, we accidentally found
that comparing with free antibodies, lager cell clusters
was observed in ACNC treated cells. Because a great
many of antibodies tightly anchored to one nanocluster,
we consider that ACNC owns the ability of binding to
different CD20s on distinct cells. This phenomenon we
termed as “inter-cell link”. Such “inter-cell link” may be
the nature of the lager cell clusters, which was similar to the
HA in previous publications [37]. Many studies suggested
that the increased HA of malignant cells might result in
increased susceptibility to PCD [46, 47]. Moreover, mAb
evoked HA of lymphoma cells can trigger intracellular
changes including mitochondrial depolarization, lysosomal
membrane permeabilization and phosphorylation or up-/
down-regulation of proteins related to the PCD signal
transduction pathways, culminating in cell death [26, 37,
38, 48]. Noted here, the mechanism about resistance
suppression by the ACNC may be related to many reasons
like the CDC, PCD or direct cell death. Herein, the
mechanism related to ACNC’s function mainly due to the
caspase-dependent and -independent programmed cell death
(PCD), or termed as direct cell death (DCD).
Further pharmacokinetics results revealed that the
elimination of ACNC from mouse peripheral blood is much
slower than that of free antibodies. The slower clearance
(CL) and longer elimination half-time (t1/2) can result in
longer circulation time of ACNC in the blood vessels, which
can contribute to its durable tumor suppressing abilities.
The in vivo distribution analysis revealed a significant
increase in the accumulation of ACNC compared with
free Rituximab and 11B8. The obviously promoted tumor
accumulation and retention is attributed to the antibodyantigen identification and combination (active targeting)
[49] and the enhanced permeability and retention effect
(EPR) (passive targeting) [50]. Additionally, both the
longer circulation time (Table 1) and the reduced “offrate” (Figure 2) may also enhance intratumor accumulation
(Figure 7). Noted here, the EPR effect mainly refers to
property that some certain sizes of molecules such as
liposomes, nanoparticles, and macromolecular drugs tend
to accumulate in tumor tissue much more than they do
in normal tissues. But the traditional EPR effect concept
may be convenient misconceptions as discussed in the
excellent perspective [51]. And further analyzed the data
discussed in the reference [52], it was found that only 5%
of particle (drug conjugate) accumulated in tumor and
about 90% accumulated in liver and spleen. But about 7%
of albumin and IgG accumulated in tumor and less than
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

10% accumulated in liver and spleen. So they claimed that
the tumor accumulation of IgG or albumin may be better
than others. In this study, the ACNC is mainly constructed
by the antibodies. Thus, the enhanced tumor accumulation
may mainly attribute to the antibody-antigen identification
and combination and multivalent binding, with part of the
convenient EPR. The detail mechanism was also shown in
Figure 1C.
In conclusion, we connstructed novel anti-CD20
mAb’s nanoclusters by a facile strategy, which contained
anti-CD20 mAb nanocluster (ACNC) from two different
anti-CD20 mAbs, type I mAb Rituximab and type II
mAb 11B8. Our experimental results indicate that this
nanocluster, which is extremely potent in PCD, exhibits
strong antitumor activity against Rituximab-resistant
B-cell lymphoma. Systemic in vitro/vivo investigation
revealed that this nanocluster can induce exceptional
potent PCD through both a caspase-dependent and
-independent pathway. Moreover, the inter-cell link with
ACNC was observed in this study, which was considered
to be related with its enhanced PCD evoking ability. The
results clearly demonstrate that this anti-CD20 mAb
nanocluster shows a unique ability to inhibit Rituximabresistance lymphomas. Our mAb nanocluster may be a
promising strategy for treating Rituximab-resistant B-cell
lymphomas, which suggested that it warrants further
evaluation as cancer therapeutics in the clinic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, materials and animals
Human B-lymphoma cell lines, Raji and Daudi,
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Cells were routinely propagated and maintained in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO, USA). Rituximab
was purchased from Roche and 11B8 was expressed
and purified in our laboratory as described previously
[29]. The rabbit anti-human IgG F(ab’)2 fragments
(RAH) and Polyethylenimine (PEI) polymer were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Four-week-old
healthy female SCID mice and BALB/C nude mice were
purchased from Shanghai Experimental Animal Center
of Chinese Academic of Sciences (Shanghai China),
housed in specific pathogen-free conditions (SPF) and
treated in accordance with guidelines of the Committee
on Animals of the Second Military Medical University
(Shanghai China).

Fabrication and characterization of anti-CD20
mAb nanoclusters
The detail preparation process and properties
of anti-CD20 mAb nanoclusters was schemed in
Figure 1A–1C. Short chain PEI polymer (25kDa, PS) was
dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and added

to maleimide-PEG-SCM (MPEGS, Greative PEGworks,
USA) solutions with a PEI/MPEGS ratio of 1:20. After
stirring for 4 hours at room temperature (RT), unreacted
MPEGS was separated by dialysis. The Rituximab ~ SH,
11B8 ~ SH and BSA ~ SH were produced as described in
previous publications [30]. Then equal amount of thiolated
Rituximab and 11B8 were mixed and dropped into a 5 ml
test tube containing the MPEGS-PEI solution (mAb/PEI
mass ratio = 1000:3.44). The reaction was carried out in
N2 environment for 6–8 hours and uncombined mAbs
were separated by dialysis. The PEI-MPEGS-BSA (PMPBSA) solutions were constructed in the same way. Purified
ACNC was quantifed by Nano VueTM (GE Healthcare)
and analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie
Brilliant Blue staining [30].

Invitrogen). After washing, the stained cells were observed
using a confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany).

Generation of Rituximab resistant Raji cells

For the establishment of Raji or Raji-anti tumor
mouse model, four groups of 10 eight-week-old female
SCID mice were injected via the tail vein with 1 × 107
Raji-WT or Raji-anti cells. After 72 hours, mice were
randomly administered through tail vein by injections
of Rituximab, Rituximab + 11B8 (1:1) and ACNC
(15 mg/kg) every other day for 5 times. The mice were
observed daily until natural death in a range of 120 days.
All animals survived were sacrificed at 120 days.
For the establishment of Daudi or Daudi-anti tumor
mouse model, Daudi-WT or Daudi-anti cells (2  × 107)
were  noculated subcutaneously into the lateral flank of
8-week-old female SCID mice. When the tumors reached
about 8 mm in length, 20 mg/kg Rituximab, Rituximab +
11B8 (1:1) or ACNC was intravenously injected though
tail vein weekly for 3 times. The tumor size was measured
in two perpendicular diameters with precision calipers
twice a week and calculated by the following equation:

Off-rate measurement
Harvested cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml
Rituximab, 11B8 or ACNC for 1 hour. Then cells were
washed and resuspended in mAb free medium. After
different time intervals, samples were collected, stained
with GAH-488 and analyzed by FCM. The percentage of
initial binding was calculated by the following equation:
sample − MFINT
Initial Binding % = a MFI
b × 100 %
MFI − MFI
0h

Immunotherapy

The Rituximab-resistant Raji and Daudi cells were
generated as described previously [31] with some minor
revisions. Briefly, wild type (WT) cells were exposed to
Rituximab at a starting concentration of 0.125 μg/ml in
RPMI-1640 containing 5% fresh human serum overnight
and then grown in normal culture medium for another
4–5 days for recovery. The concentration of Rituximab
was increased by two times every week for 11 cycles until
128 μg/ml. The cells were named by their parental cells
with the final concentration of Rituximab to which they
were resistant (such as Raji-anti/1.125 μg/ml). For the sake
of simplicity, the cells resistant to 128 μg/ml Rituximab
was just named as Raji-anti or Daudi-anti for short.

Confocal microscopy
For confocal microscopy, harvested cells were
placed onto poly-D-lysine (sigma-Aldrich) coated
microscope slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and
permeabilized by 0.3% Triton X-100. After staining,
samples were observed using a confocal microscope
(Zeiss, Germany). Noted here, the artefact appeared
in FC and confocal, which may be induced by the
antibodies or some HA as mentioned by Golay et al [32].
So in the experiments of confocal or FC, the samples
were carefully purification and checked by the inversed
fluorescent microscopy to ensure no artefacts existed in
the system.

Tumor Volume = Length * Width2 / 2

Annexin V & PI staining
Rituximab, 11B8 and ACNC treated cells were
stained with Alexa Fluor-488 Annexin-V&Propidium
Iodide (PI) (Invitrogen) and analyzed by two channelFCM of FL-1 (Annexin-V) and FL-2 (PI) following
the product information. For PCD inhibition assays, a
caspases inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK, Promega) with different
concentrations was added before the addition of mAbs or
ACNCs.

Binding avidity assays

CDC and ADCC assays

The binding avidity was assessed by confocal
microscopy. Briefly, 10 μg/ml Rituximab, 11B8 or ACNC
was incubated with harvested cells for 1 hour on ice,
rinsed with PBS and labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 goat
anti-human IgG secondary antibody (GAH-488, 1:500,

NT

Cells were incubated with different concentrations
of anti-CD20 mAbs or ACNCs. For CDC assays, 5% (v/v)
fresh human serum was added as a source of complement.
For ADCC assays, human peripheral blood mononuclear

were collected and the frozen sections stained by
GAH-488 were visualized by the CLSM. Meanwhile,
different  tissues were added with cell lysis buffer and
lysed by the tissuelyser-24 (Shanghai jingxin experimental
technology, Shanghai China). After centrifugation, ELISA
was employed to investigate the supernatant concentration
of therapeutic mAbs.

Lysosomal permeability assessment

Statistical analysis

Cells were labeled with 200 nM Lyso-Tracker Red
DND (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 30 minutes after treating
with 10 μg/ml anti-CD20 mAbs or ACNCs for 16 hours.
Then FL-2 fluorescence of labeled cells was assessed by
FCM and confocal microscope. Unlabeled cells were used
as a background control [33].

Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s
unpaired t test or ANOVA to identify significant
differences unless otherwise indicated. Differences were
considered significant at a p value of less than 0.05.
ANOVA was used for comparing the difference among
three or more groups in the experiments.
