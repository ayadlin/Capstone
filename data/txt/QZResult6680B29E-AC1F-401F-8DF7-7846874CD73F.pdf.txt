Abstract
We previously elucidated an important role for gangliosides in
renal cell carcinoma–mediated T lymphocyte apoptosis,
although the mechanism by which they mediated lymphocyte
death remained unclear. Here, we show that when added in
purified form, GD3 is internalized by activated T cells,
initiating a series of proapoptotic events, including the
induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an enhancement
of p53 and Bax accumulation, an increase in mitochondrial
permeability, cytochrome c release, and the activation of
caspase-9. GD3-induced apoptosis of activated T cells was dose
dependent and inhibitable by pretreating the lymphocytes
with N-acetylcysteine, cyclosporin A, or bongkrekic acid,
emphasizing the essential role of ROS and mitochondrial
permeability to the process. Ganglioside-induced T-cell killing
was associated with the caspase-dependent degradation of
nuclear factor-KB–inducible, antiapoptotic proteins, including RelA; this suggests that their loss is initiated only after the
cascade is activated and that their disappearance amplifies
but not triggers GD3 susceptibility. Resting T cells did not
internalize appreciable levels of GD3 and did not undergo
any of the proapoptotic changes that characterize activated
T lymphocytes exposed to the ganglioside. RelA overexpression endows Jurkat cells with resistance to GD3-mediated
apoptosis, verifying the role of the intact transcription factor
in mediating protection from the ganglioside. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Evidence accumulated by our laboratory over the last several
years has increasingly implicated gangliosides as being soluble
tumor-derived factors that contribute significantly to T-cell
apoptosis (1–5). Gangliosides are structurally diverse acidic
glycosphingolipids that are present in the outer leaflet of plasma
membranes (6) and consist of a sialic acid–containing carbohydrate component attached to ceramide. Many tumors exhibit
enhanced synthesis of select gangliosides, some of which are shed
into the tumor microenvironment (7, 8). Malignant melanomas and

neuroblastomas overexpress GD3, GD2, and GM2, whereas renal
cell carcinomas (RCC) were reported to display increased levels of
GD1a, GM1, and GM2 compared with cells of the normal kidney
(9). Some tumor-derived gangliosides inhibit specific aspects of the
immune response and thereby contribute to tumor formation and
progression (10–15). Because neuraminidase abrogated the apoptotic effects that RCC supernatants have on T cells, we
hypothesized that gangliosides were involved in RCC-mediated
immune dysfunction (16), a finding later confirmed by both
the capacity of the ganglioside synthesis inhibitor 1-phenyl-2hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (PPPP) to abrogate
RCC-mediated killing of cocultured T lymphocytes (2) and the
ability of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) treatment of RCC lines to
coordinately enhance their ganglioside accumulation and apoptogenicity for coincubated T cells (3).
Our present work focuses on the mechanism by which gangliosides induce T-cell apoptosis. Current evidence implies that
gangliosides mediate their proapoptotic effects by directly
activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In separate reports,
Garcia-Ruiz and colleagues (17) and Rippo and colleagues (18)
showed that the ganglioside GD3 could stimulate a burst of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial permeability in
purified mitochondria, leading to the release of apoptogenic factors
such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Later
studies showed that mitochondria are targeted even when intact
cells are exposed to gangliosides, as GD3-treated hepatocytes
underwent apoptosis in association with ROS production, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), cytochrome c release, and
activation of caspase-9 (19, 20).
The means by which tumor-derived gangliosides stimulate the
apoptosis of T cells remains undefined, however. Garcia-Ruiz and
colleagues showed that in response to TNFa, endogenous GD3
redistributes from the outer leaflet of hepatocyte membranes to
mitochondria via Rab5- and Rab7-positive endosomes, where it
induces the same series of proapoptotic events observed when
isolated mitochondria are treated with the same ganglioside (20).
Studies pertaining to ganglioside transport in Niemann-Pick
disease indicate that even exogenous gangliosides can be
internalized and targeted to the Golgi complex within Rabexpressing vesicles (21), potentially localizing to the mitochondria
where they can induce toxic levels of ROS in glutathione-depleted
cells, as described previously for the transported endogenous
gangliosides (20). The notion that exogenous gangliosides may also
stimulate T-cell apoptosis in a mitochondrial-dependent manner is
suggested by the ability of the Bcl-2 transgene to protect CEM
lymphoma cells from GD3-induced caspase-9 activation and death
(18). The experiments described below suggest that such a scenario
may in fact be the mechanism by which GD3 kills T lymphocytes:
we find that GD3 specifically induces the apoptosis of activated but
not resting T cells. Our results indicate that activated T cells

internalize abundant levels of exogenously administered GD3
within 90 minutes, causing ROS production, MPT, and cytochrome
c release by 24 hours and apoptosis by 48 hours. GD3-mediated
apoptosis additionally involves p53 stabilization and induction of
Bax and is amplified by the caspase-dependent degradation of
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)–inducible antiapoptotic proteins. Resting T cells, which fail to internalize appreciable levels of the
ganglioside, do not undergo any of these proapoptotic changes
within the time frame examined, thus explaining the comparative
resistance of that lymphocyte population to GD3-mediated
destruction.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and reagents. Anti-Bcl-xL, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Ciap-2, anti-p53,
anti-Bax, anti-RelA, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated donkey
anti-goat IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-XIAP was from BD
Transduction Laboratories, and anti-actin (AC-15) was from Novus
Biologicals. Anti-procaspase-9 and procaspase-8 antibodies were from
Oncogene Research Products, and anti-cytochrome c and anti-GD3 were
from BD Pharmingen. HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse and donkey antirabbit secondary antibodies were from Amersham, and caspase inhibitor III,
caspase-9 inhibitor II, and caspase-8 inhibitor I (IETD-CHO) were all
obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3, Ortho Biotech) and
anti-CD28 antibody (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) were
used for the stimulation of T lymphocytes. Human recombinant interleukin2 (IL-2; CHIRON Corp.) was used at 20 units/mL to maintain the viability of
activated T cells.
Cell lines and tissue culture conditions. Wild-type Jurkat cells,
caspase-8–negative Jurkat cells (gift from Dr. John Blenis, Harvard
University, Boston, MA; ref. 22), HA-RelA–overexpressing Jurkat cells (1),
primary RCC lines (23), the long-term RCC lines SK-RC-45 and SK-RC-26b
(gift of Dr. Neil Bander, The New York Hospital, Cornell University Medical
College, New York, NY; ref. 3), and the normal kidney epithelial (NKE) cell
line (24) were derived and maintained as described previously. The caspase9 dominant-negative Jurkat cell line was generated using a cDNA expression
vector encoding the active site mutation cysteine-287 to alanine (25). A wellcharacterized, long-term glioblastoma cell line, U87, was obtained courtesy
of Dr. Michael Vogelbaum (Cleveland Clinic) and CCF52 was a short-term
GBM line subcultured from a fresh glioma by our Brain Tumor Registry.
Immunofluorescence. Tumor cells were immunostained to assess GD3
expression levels. RCC tumor cells, NKE control cells, and glioblastoma cells
were fixed, blocked, and stained with 2 Ag/mL anti-GD3 antibodies as
described previously (5). After washing, the cells were incubated with an
Alexa Fluor 594–labeled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes), washed,
and counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize
the nuclei.
Resting and activated T cells were also assessed for their capacity to
internalize GD3. The lymphocytes were adhered to lysine-coated glass slides
for 2 h at 4jC in complete medium, at which time the medium was replaced
with a solution of 25 Ag/mL GD3 in plain RPMI 1640. Ganglioside was
allowed to adhere to the cells for 1 h at 4jC, at which point the slides were
moved to 37jC for the designated times before being fixed, permeabilized,
and immunostained for GD3 expression as described above.
Isolation of T cells. T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of
healthy volunteers with informed consent, as described before (3). The
T-cell isolation procedure yielded cells that were >95% positive for CD3
as defined by immunocytometry. T cells were stimulated with crosslinked anti-CD3 (OKT3) and anti-CD28 antibodies for 3 d (26) and were
then transferred to fresh flasks for further expansion in the presence of
20 units/mL IL-2 before use.
Induction and analysis of peripheral blood T-cell apoptosis. Resting
and/or activated T cells (1  106/mL) were cultured in the presence or
absence of GD3 for specified times before being analyzed for gangliosideinduced apoptosis by staining the lymphocytes with Annexin V and
7-aminoactinomycin-D (7AAD; BD Pharmingen). Events were acquired on a

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

multivariable FACScan, and analysis was done using quadrant software
(CellQuest v3.3, Becton Dickinson). Lymphocytes were additionally stained
with 4¶6¶-diamidoino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and analyzed by fluorescent
microscopy to assess the number of T cells with apoptotic nuclei in the
GD3-treated or untreated cultures. In some experiments, cells were
pretreated with an antioxidant [N-acetylcysteine (NAC), 10 mmol/L;
Sigma-Aldrich] or with inhibitors of mitochondrial permeability [cyclosporin A (CsA) and bongkrekic acid (BA); Calbiochem] before their exposure
to GD3 to assess the role of mitochondrial involvement in gangliosidemediated T-cell apoptosis. In other experiments, activated T cells were
pretreated with 150 Amol/L of caspase-8 inhibitor I, caspase-9 inhibitor II,
or the pan-caspase inhibitor III before ganglioside administration to assess
the role of specific caspases in mediating GD3-induced lymphocyte killing.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Resting and activated T cells
were pretreated or not with 100 Ag/mL GD3 for 48 h before stimulating
the lymphocytes for 0, 15, and 30 min with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA; 10 ng/mL) and ionomycin (0.750 Ag/mL), at which point nuclear
extracts were isolated and prepared in binding reaction buffer, as previously
described (13). Oligonucleotide corresponding to the IL-2Ra (5¶-CAACGGCAGGGGAATCTCCCTCTCCTT-3¶) was obtained from Qiagen Operon and
used as a probe. Radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were
prepared and labeled with [a-32P]dCTP and were used in binding reactions
with 10 Ag of nuclear protein, as described previously. Samples were resolved
on 6% polyacrylamide gels and were dried and analyzed as before (1).
Protein extracts, Western blot analysis, and cytochrome c assays.
Cell lysates were prepared and run on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with primary antibodies as
described previously (1, 27). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized
using HRP-linked secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL Western blotting kit, Amersham). Cytochrome c assays were
performed as before (4).
Assessment of ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential.
Measurement of intracellular ROS was as described previously (28). Briefly,
3  106 resting or activated peripheral blood T cells were cocultured with
GD3 for 18 h before isolating the lymphocytes and incubating them for an
additional hour with 10 Amol/L 5,6-carboxy-2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA, Molecular Probes). Cells were analyzed flow
cytometrically for DCFDA fluorescence using an excitation wavelength of
488 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm. For measuring
mitochondrial membrane potentials (Dw m), T cells were treated with GD3
for 18 h as described above before incubating the lymphocytes for an
additional 15 min at 37jC in 500 AL of 40 nmol/L DiOC6. The cells were
then analyzed immediately by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission
wavelength of 530 nm (29).
Statistical analysis. The Student’s t test (paired two samples for mean
or two samples using equal variances) was used to determine P using
Microsoft Excel software (version 2003). SE was calculated from SD using
Microsoft Excel software.

Results
GD3 induces T-cell apoptosis. GD3 was used as the prototypic
ganglioside in these studies for multiple reasons: it is overexpressed
in numerous tumors of neuroectodermal and epithelial origin,
including RCC (Fig. 1; ref. 30); it is associated with both tumor
progression (31) and immunosuppression (32, 33); and unlike some
species of gangliosides, it has already been observed to induce the
apoptosis of multiple cell types (19, 20, 34–36). Indeed, we now show
that resting and activated T cells show the same relative
susceptibilities to purified GD3 as they do to ganglioside-producing
tumor cells (Fig. 2A and B; refs. 3, 5). When resting and 5-day–
activated T cells were treated in vitro with 100 Ag/mL GD3, f52%
of the activated lymphocytes became apoptotic by 48 hours, as
assessed by FACS analysis of Annexin V/7AAD–stained cells (Fig. 2A
and B). This was in stark contrast to the ganglioside-treated resting

GD3 Efficiently Kills Activated but not Resting T Cells

Figure 1. GD3 is expressed by RCC and glioblastoma tumors and cell lines. Normal kidney epithelium, RCC cell lines SK-RC-45 and SK-RC-26, and the
glioblastoma cell line U87 were grown on coverslips and were fixed and permeabilized before being immunostained with 2 Ag/mL anti-GD3 followed by an Alexa Fluor
594–labeled secondary antibody. Primary RCC and glioblastoma tumor cells were similarly stained following their isolation from biopsied patient samples, as
described in Materials and Methods. Nuclei were revealed by DAPI staining.

T cells, which remained mostly viable throughout the 72-hour
period monitored. Other criteria were also used to gauge
ganglioside-mediated T-cell damage. Viable cells can also be
differentiated by DAPI staining, which reveals the nuclear
fragmentation and nuclear membrane invagination that uniquely
typify apoptotic cells. Although the percentage of activated, GD3treated T cells with apoptotic nuclei per visual field significantly
increased following 48 hours of culture, ganglioside-treated resting
lymphocytes retained morphologically normal nuclei throughout
this time frame (Fig. 2C). Minimal killing of resting T cells was
observed even at 200 Ag/mL GD3, again contrasting with activated
cells, which showed progressively escalating levels of susceptibility
to GD3 as the ganglioside concentration was increased from 25 to
100 Ag/mL (Fig. 2D).
Activated but not resting T lymphocytes readily internalize
exogenous GD3. To assess the possibility that T-cell apoptosis
induced by exogenous GD3 might require its internalization and
intracellular trafficking, resting and activated T cells were
compared for their relative abilities to internalize exogenous GD3
over the course of 2 hours. Cells were adhered to lysine-coated
glass slides before being treated or not with 25 Ag/mL GD3 for 30,
60, 90, or 120 minutes, at which points the cells were fixed,
permeabilized, and stained with anti-GD3 antibodies. When
intracellular GD3 staining was compared at each time point by
fluorescent microscopy, it was apparent that, unlike the resting
cells, which remained mostly GD3 negative through 60 minutes
of treatment and showed only hints of positivity at 90 and
120 minutes, the activated T cells showed definite signs of GD3
internalization by 30 minutes, stained highly positive by 60 and
90 minutes, but had diminishing levels at 2 hours (Fig. 3A).
Interestingly, even when washed and incubated in medium
following a 30-minute exposure to GD3, f40% of the activated
T-cell population still became apoptotic by 48 hours (Fig. 3B),
suggesting that lymphocytes need not be continuously exposed to
gangliosides for the molecules to mediate their toxic effects. To
address the argument that activated T cells have highly ruffled
membranes, which bind more ganglioside and hence only give the
appearance of increased ganglioside internalization, FACS analysis
and confocal microscopy were performed on GD3-treated resting
and activated T cells that were permeabilized or not to
discriminate between adherent and internalized ganglioside. There
was comparable binding of anti-GD3 with nonpermeabilized
resting and activated T cells, reflecting the fact that the ganglioside

www.aacrjournals.org

adhered equivalently to both. FACS analysis of permeabilized cells,
however, revealed the extent to which resting and activated T cells
differed in their capacities to internalize GD3. GD3-treated
permeabilized and nonpermeabilized resting T cells stained
equivalently with the anti-GD3 antibody, indicating that resting
T cells did not internalize much ganglioside. This contrasted with
the permeabilized, GD3-treated activated T cells, which stained
GD3 positive with far greater intensity than either nonpermeabilized activated T cells or permeabilized resting T cells (Fig. 3C).
Similar results were obtained when the same cells were subjected
to examination by confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S1).
ROS accumulation, mitochondrial permeability, and cytochrome c release occur in activated but not resting T cells
following treatment with GD3. To determine which GD3-induced
proapoptotic events are differentially induced in activated and
resting T cells, thereby explaining the differential susceptibility of
those two populations to ganglioside-mediated death, lymphocytes
were treated with 100 Ag/mL GD3 before being analyzed for
various parameters of apoptosis over the course of 72 hours.
DCFDA fluorescence revealed that the GD3-treated, activated T-cell
population generated elevated levels of ROS that were readily
detectable by FACS within 24 hours (Fig. 4A). This contrasted with
our findings for resting T cells, which, consistent with their
decreased sensitivity to GD3-induced apoptosis and their only
minimal capacity to internalize ganglioside, did not produce
measurable levels of ROS within the same time frame (Fig. 4A).
When DiOC6 fluorescence was used as a measure of increased
mitochondrial permeability in response to GD3, the activated T
cells were found to have progressed beyond ROS production to this
advanced state by 48 hours after ganglioside treatment (Fig. 4B).
Western analysis revealed that the GD3 treatment had also induced
the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm of the CD3/CD28stimulated T cells, a requisite step for the direct activation of
caspase-9 (Fig. 4C). Resting T cells, on the other hand, were not
stimulated to augmented ROS production by GD3 (Fig. 4A) and did
not undergo MPT or cytochrome c release in response to the
ganglioside (Fig. 4B and C), consistent with the comparative
resistance of the naive lymphocytes to GD3-mediated killing.
Antioxidants and inhibitors of mitochondrial permeability
largely abrogate GD3-mediated apoptosis of activated T cells.
Because GD3-induced reactive oxygen intermediates seem to act as
mediators of T-cell apoptosis, we explored the capacity of NAC to
protect the lymphocytes from ganglioside-induced death. When

Figure 2. GD3 can induce the apoptosis of activated but not resting T cells. A, T cells were isolated from healthy volunteers and were activated or not with
anti-CD3/CD28 for 5 d. Both lymphocyte populations were exposed to 100 Ag/mL GD3 for 24, 48, and 72 h and, at each time point, were assessed and compared for
ganglioside-induced apoptosis by Annexin V/7AAD staining, as described in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean of six experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.005
versus preactivated T cells in medium alone. B, typical Annexin V/7AAD staining data obtained by flow cytometry, which was used to generate the results
presented in A and in all subsequent experiments assessing T-cell apoptosis under various experimental conditions. C, resting and anti-CD3/CD28–activated
T cells were treated or not with 100 Ag/mL GD3 for 72 h before being stained with DAPI to quantify apoptotic nuclei by fluorescent microscopy. D, resting and
anti-CD3/CD28–activated T cells were treated or not with 25, 50, 100, or 200 Ag/mL of GD3 for 72 h before being assessed for ganglioside-induced apoptosis by Annexin
V/7AAD staining, as described in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean of three experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.005; **, P < 0.05 versus untreated activated T cells.

activated T cells were treated with GD3 in the presence of
10 mmol/L NAC, lymphocyte killing was reduced by f50%
(Fig. 4D). The effects of BA and CsA on GD3-induced lymphocyte
apoptosis were next determined, as each specifically inhibits a
unique aspect of mitochondrial permeability. Only 12% to 15% of
activated T cells underwent apoptosis when treated with GD3 in
the presence of either CsA or BA, a significant reduction from the
f52% of cells that were killed when GD3 was administered in
medium alone (Fig. 4D). The abilities of NAC, CsA, and BA to each
inhibit GD3-mediated apoptosis of activated T cells collectively
point to the integral role of ROS and mitochondria in mediating the
ganglioside-induced effects.
Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 are required for optimal GD3mediated apoptosis of activated T cells. Activated T cells were
next treated with 100 Ag/mL GD3 for 72 hours in the presence or
absence of either a pan-caspase inhibitor or specific inhibitors of
caspase-8 or caspase-9 before being assessed for Annexin V/7AAD
positivity. The pan-caspase inhibitor provided the greatest

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

protection, decreasing GD3-mediated apoptosis of the treated cells
5-fold to f10% of the total population. The caspase-9 inhibitor
was also extremely effective, as it reduced the killing from 52% to
f22% (Fig. 5A). The fact that the caspase-8 inhibitor also
significantly reduced GD3-mediated killing of activated T cells
(Fig. 5A) was somewhat surprising because these and previous
studies suggest that the initial insult occurs to the mitochondrion
(17, 18, 20). This result was supported, however, by experiments
gauging the relative susceptibilities of wild-type, caspase-8–
negative, and caspase-9–negative Jurkat cells to the ganglioside
(Fig. 5B). As compared with the 55% of wild-type Jurkat cells that
underwent apoptosis following a 3-day exposure to GD3, both
mutant lines were significantly protected, with killing of the
caspase-8–negative and caspase-9–negative cells dropping to 25%
and 17% of the ganglioside-exposed populations, respectively
(Fig. 5B). The dependence on both caspase-8 and caspase-9 for
optimal GD3-mediated killing of activated T cells and Jurkat cells
contrasts with results obtained using TPEN, a prototypic and

potent agonist of the mitochondrial pathway, which induced close
to 75% of the activated T cells to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 5A). Here,
caspase-9 was observed to be of foremost importance to the
response, with only a minimal requirement for caspase-8: whereas
both the pan-caspase inhibitor and the caspase-9 inhibitor reduced
TPEN-induced T-cell apoptosis from 72% of the cells to 20% and
30%, respectively, the caspase-8 inhibitor had only a negligible
protective effect on TPEN-induced killing (Fig. 5A).
GD3 treatment decreases the expression of NF-KB–
dependent, antiapoptotic proteins in activated but not resting
T cells. We previously showed that RCC-mediated killing of
cocultured activated T lymphocytes was associated with the
depletion of antiapoptotic T-cell proteins by a mechanism that
could be abrogated by pretreating the tumor cells with the
ganglioside synthesis inhibitor PPPP (1, 23). Here, we asked
whether GD3 treatment alone would decrease antiapoptotic
protein expression, and if so, whether the effect was limited to

the GD3-susceptible, activated T-cell population. We found that in
addition to activating caspase-8 and caspase-9 in the activated
T cells, as evidenced by the depletion of their zymogens (Fig. 5C),
GD3 also mediated a dramatic and progressive decline in Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL expression levels (Fig. 5C), findings deemed significant given
the important contributions those proteins make to maintaining
the integrity of mitochondrial membranes (37). Ciap-2 and XIAP
are also NF-nB–dependent antiapoptotic proteins that function by
blocking the activity of effector caspases (38) and GD3 decreased
these too from the elevated levels that characterize activated T cells
(Fig. 5C). Importantly, none of these protein modifications
occurred in GD3-treated resting T cells, consistent with their
resistance to ganglioside-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C).
A pan-caspase inhibitor abrogates GD3-mediated decreases
in NF-KB–dependent, antiapoptotic protein expression but
does not inhibit the induction of p53 or Bax. Because we
observed that GD3-mediated apoptosis of activated T cells (Fig. 2)

Figure 3. Activated T cells internalize GD3 at a faster rate and in greater amounts than resting T cells. A, resting T cells isolated from a healthy donor were compared
with 5-d anti-CD3/CD28–activated T cells for their capacity to internalize exogenously administered GD3. Cells were adhered onto lysine-coated slides for 2 h at
37jC and were cooled to 4jC before replacing the complete medium with a solution of 25 Ag/mL GD3 in plain RPMI 1640. The ganglioside was allowed to adhere to
cells for 1 h at 4jC, at which point slides were washed briefly to remove nonadherent GD3, and then moved to 37jC for the designated times before being fixed,
permeabilized, and immunostained with 2 Ag/mL anti-GD3 followed by an Alexa Fluor 594–labeled secondary antibody. B, 30 min of GD3 exposure can induce the
apoptosis of activated T cells by 48 h. T cells were isolated from healthy volunteers and were activated or not with anti-CD3/CD28 for 5 d. Cells were either continuously
exposed to 100 Ag/mL GD3 or had the ganglioside washed away and replaced with fresh medium after a 30-min treatment. Apoptosis of all treatment groups was
measured and compared at 48 h by counting number of DAPI-stained, blebbed nuclei per 100 cells. Bars, SE. *, P < 0.005 versus activated T cells in medium alone.
C, internalized GD3 cannot be visualized unless lymphocytes are permeabilized before immunostaining. Resting and activated T cells were exposed to 50 Ag/mL
GD3 for 30 min and then were fixed and permeabilized or not before being stained with 2 Ag/mL anti-GD3 and an Alexa Fluor 488–labeled secondary antibody for
analysis by flow cytometry.

were activated or not with anti-CD3/CD28 for 5 d. Cells were exposed to 100 Ag/mL
GD3 over the course of 48 h, and at various time points, different parameters of
GD3-induced proapoptotic effects were measured on each population. A, resting
and activated Tcells exposed to GD3 for 24 h were treated with 2 Amol/L DCFDA for
15 min and were subjected to FACS analysis to assess ROS production, as
measured by the increase in DCFDA fluorescence over medium controls. B, to
detect the loss of mitochondrial potential following 48 h of exposure to GD3,
resting and activated T cells were stained with 40 nmol/L of the mitochondrial
potential-sensitive dye DiOC6 for 15 min. The two populations were compared by
FACS analysis for their decreased levels of DiOC6 staining following exposure to
GD3, which serves as a measure of their susceptibility to GD3-induced activation
of MPT. C, resting and activated Tcells exposed to GD3 for 48 h were homogenized
in mitochondrial isolation buffer, and supernatants were subjected to Western
analysis using 30 Ag of protein/lane and antibodies to cytochrome c. Cells treated
with the apoptogenic agent TPEN served as positive controls for cytochrome c
release. Actin served as a loading control. D, activated Tcells were pretreated or not
with the antioxidant NAC or the mitochondrial pathway inhibitors CsA or BA before
being exposed to GD3 for 72 h and then measured for ganglioside-induced
apoptosis by Annexin V/7AAD staining, as described in Materials and Methods.

analysis using antibodies to p53 and Bax. We found that the
ganglioside did in fact up-regulate both p53 and Bax (Fig. 5D),
results consistent with the capacity of the ganglioside to
sequentially induce downstream ROS accumulation, increased
mitochondrial permeability, cytochrome c release, and initiation of
the caspase cascade. When GD3 treatment of activated T cells took
place in the presence of a pan-caspase inhibitor, the gangliosidemediated loss of Bcl-xL, Ciap-2, and XIAP expression levels was
abrogated, suggesting that the activation of caspases either directly
or indirectly diminished the expression of those proteins (Fig. 5D).
The GD3-mediated inductions of p53 and Bax, on the other hand,
were not prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor, results expected
of molecular events upstream of ganglioside-induced caspase
activation (Fig. 5D).
Previous studies from our laboratory showed that SK-RC-45
induced RelA degradation in cocultured, activated T cells by
mechanism that was both tumor ganglioside and caspase
dependent (1). To assess the relative susceptibilities of resting
and activated T cells to GD3-mediated proteolysis of RelA, Western
analysis was performed on whole-cell lysates made from each
population following a 48-hour exposure to the ganglioside. RelA
levels in resting T cells were not altered by the ganglioside but
dropped precipitously in GD3-treated activated T cells by a
mechanism that was caspase dependent (Fig. 6A and B), results
paralleling those observed for the antiapoptotic proteins. Consistent findings were obtained when RelA activity in the GD3-treated
cells was monitored by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA). As compared with unstimulated cells, treatment of resting
and activated T cells with PMA/ionomycin resulted in the
translocation of RelA to the nucleus, as evidenced by its increased
binding to an oligonucleotide encoding the kB element of the
IL-2Ra gene (Fig. 6C). A 48-hour pretreatment of the activated
T cells with GD3 completely inhibited the PMA/ionomycin-induced
nuclear translocation of RelA, however, although the ganglioside
had no such effect on the resting cells (Fig. 6C).
Overexpression of RelA protects Jurkat cells from GD3induced apoptosis. The possibility that ganglioside-induced
NF-nB degradation contributes to GD3-mediated T-cell apoptosis
led us to ask whether overexpressing RelA would confer protection
to GD3-treated Jurkat cells. A Jurkat cell clone permanently
transfected with the PcDNA3/HA-RelA construct (1) was therefore
compared with wild-type Jurkat cells for their susceptibility to GD3.
Neither wild-type nor RelA-transfected Jurkat cells showed
significant susceptibility to the ganglioside after 24 hours of
treatment, although by 48 hours the RelA-overexpressing cells had
a distinct survival advantage: 33% of wild-type Jurkat cells had
succumbed to GD3, but only 12% of the RelA-transfected cells
stained positive for Annexin V/7AAD (Fig. 6D). The ability of the
RelA transgene to inhibit GD3-mediated killing of Jurkat cells by
66% points to the importance of continuous RelA-induced
antiapoptotic gene transcription in protecting T cells from
ganglioside-induced apoptosis.

Discussion
Here, we show that GD3 can mediate the apoptosis of activated
T cells by a mechanism involving enhanced production of ROS, p53,
and Bax accumulation, the induction of mitochondrial permeability, the stimulation of cytochrome c release, and the activation of
caspase-9, events all initiated and occurring sequentially following
GD3 internalization by the lymphocytes. Resting T cells did not

GD3 Efficiently Kills Activated but not Resting T Cells

Figure 5. Caspase inhibitors abrogate both GD3-induced T-cell apoptosis and GD3-stimulated degradation of antiapoptotic proteins. A, 5-d anti-CD3/CD28–activated
T cells were treated or not with 100 Ag/mL GD3 for 72 h in the presence or absence of a pan-caspase inhibitor, or specific inhibitors of caspase-8 or caspase-9,
before being assessed for apoptosis by FACS analysis of Annexin V/7AAD–stained cells. Cells treated with TPEN in the presence or absence of the caspase inhibitors
served as controls. Columns, mean of three experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.005 versus untreated T cells in plain medium. B, wild-type Jurkat cells, caspase-8–negative
Jurkat cells, and Jurkat cells rendered caspase-9 deficient following overexpression of a dominant-negative form of the enzyme were treated with GD3 for 72 h
before being assessed for apoptosis by Annexin V staining, as described in Materials and Methods. Resting and activated T cells were treated or not with 100 Ag/mL
GD3 for 24 and 48 h. Columns, mean of three experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.005 versus GD3-treated wild-type Jurkat cells. C, resting and activated T cells
were treated or not with 100 Ag/mL GD3 for 24 and 48 h, at which point cytoplasmic lysates made from those cells were subjected to Western analysis using
20 Ag/protein/lane and antibodies to Ciap-2, XIAP, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, procaspase-8, and procaspase-9. Actin was used as a loading control. D, resting and activated
T cells were treated or not with 100 Ag/mL GD3 for 24 h in the presence or absence of a pan-caspase inhibitor, at which point cytoplasmic lysates made from those

readily internalize GD3 and were not observed to undergo any of
the aforementioned proapoptotic changes in response to the
ganglioside. The GD3-induced apoptosis of activated T cells was
first detectable 48 hours after ganglioside treatment and was
dose dependent, becoming evident at 25 Ag/mL, appreciable at
50 Ag/mL, and plateauing at 100 Ag/mL. Interestingly, unfractionated, tumor-derived gangliosides collectively induce T-cell
apoptosis at even 7 Ag/mL, suggesting that the glycosphingolipids
likely synergize to mediate appreciable lymphocyte death at much
lower, more physiologically relevant concentrations in vivo (23).
Bcl-xL, Ciap-2, and XIAP were degraded in the GD3-treated
activated T cells by a mechanism that was caspase dependent,
suggesting that although a deficiency of antiapoptotic proteins
might have amplified GD3-induced T-cell apoptosis, their loss did
not initiate the process. Previous studies performed in other cell
types and on the purified organelles indicated that GD3 exerts its

www.aacrjournals.org

apoptogenic effects by acting directly on mitochondria. Our
observation that activated T cells pretreated with NAC, CsA, or
BA were able to resist GD3-induced apoptosis attested to a similar
role for GD3-stimulated ROS production and mitochondrial
permeability in mediating the death of intact lymphocytes as well.
Based on our results, it would seem that T-cell internalization of
GD3 is requisite for the ganglioside to mediate its apoptotic effects:
when assessed by both confocal microscopy and FACS analysis, it
was only the activated T cells that internalized appreciable
amounts of the ganglioside, which correlated with the unique
susceptibility of that population to GD3-mediated killing. Although
we are presently examining the itinerary of internalized gangliosides in T cells, there is precedence in other cell types for
endogenous GD3 to be transported from the plasma membrane to
mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli such as TNFa (20), a
molecule synthesized by activated but not resting T cells (5).

Figure 6. GD3 inhibits NF-nB activation in anti-CD3/CD28–stimulated T cells by a mechanism that involves inhibition of RelA expression. A, resting and 5-d anti-CD3/
CD28–activated T cells were treated or not for 48 h with 100 Ag/mL GD3, at which point whole-cell lysates made from those cells were subjected to Western
analysis using 20 Ag/protein/lane and antibodies to RelA. Actin was used as a loading control. B, activated T cells were treated or not for 48 h with 100 Ag/mL GD3 in
the presence or absence of a pan-caspase inhibitor, at which point whole-cell lysates made from those cells were subjected to Western analysis using 20 Ag/protein/lane
and antibodies to RelA. Actin was used as a loading control. C, resting and activated T cells were treated or not for 48 h with 100 Ag/mL GD3, at which time the
lymphocytes were stimulated for 0, 15, or 30 min with 10 ng/mL PMA and 0.75 Ag/mL ionomycin. Nuclear lysates prepared from the lymphocytes were then subjected to
EMSA analysis as described in Materials and Methods using the NF-nB consensus site of the IL-2Ra promoter as probe. D, wild-type and RelA-transfected Jurkat
cells were treated or not with GD3 for 24 and 48 h, at which times the lymphocytes were assessed for ganglioside-induced apoptosis by Annexin V/7AAD staining
and FACS analysis, as described in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean of three experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.005 versus wild-type Jurkat cells treated
with GD3 for 48 h.

Consistent with their common structural features, it is hypothesized that GD3, like ceramide, initiates the accumulation of toxic
ROS by disrupting electron flow at complex III of the respiratory
chain (17, 28). Resulting oxidative stresses trigger conformational
changes in inner mitochondrial membrane proteins, leading to
MPT, cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9, and the
apoptosis observed in these ganglioside-treated cells (17). A role for
ROS in ganglioside-mediated apoptosis of activated T cells was
shown by the ability of NAC to inhibit the killing by >50%. The
capacity of both CsA and BA to reduce GD3-mediated apoptosis of
activated T cells 3- to 5-fold from the levels observed with GD3
alone further underscored the important contribution of GD3induced mitochondrial permeability to T-cell killing.
Associated with the GD3-mediated apoptosis of activated T cells
was the augmented expression of p53 and Bax, the mitochondrial
release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase-9. p53 is a
transcription factor activated in response to cellular stresses and
mediates its effects by inducing the de novo expression of growthinhibitory or proapoptotic molecules that prevent the proliferation
of damaged or infected cells (39). The protein is ordinarily short
lived, being maintained at low levels by an inhibitor that restricts
its transcription and promotes its degradation. When the cell
perceives DNA damage or toxic ROS, however, p53 is stabilized,
leading to the transcriptional activation of Bax, a proapoptotic
Bcl-2 family member that forms the mitochondrial pores through

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

which cytochrome c enters the cytoplasm to initiate the intrinsic
pathway (39). Consistent with our findings, Bharti and Singh (40)
previously detected elevated p53 and Bax in murine bone marrow
cells en route to an apoptotic cell death following a 24-hour
treatment with purified T-cell lymphoma gangliosides. Although in
our studies the pan-caspase inhibitor prevented GD3-mediated
apoptosis, it could not abrogate the ganglioside-induced elevations
of p53 or Bax expression, indicating that GD3-stimulated ROS and
the sequential elevations in p53 and Bax are caspase-independent
steps in the pathway to lymphocyte death.
Enhancing the GD3-mediated apoptosis of activated T cells was
the ganglioside-induced depletion of several antiapoptotic proteins,
including Ciap-2, XIAP, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2. Ciap-2 and XIAP both
abrogate apoptosis by directly binding and inhibiting caspases,
whereas Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 control survival by inhibiting Bax and
BAK, proapoptotic proteins that produce the mitochondrial pores
that release cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and AIF (41). The ability
of the pan-caspase inhibitor to prevent Bcl-xL, Ciap-2, and XIAP
loss during the GD3 treatment of activated T cells suggests that
those proteins are stable until the caspase cascade is activated; so,
although the depletion of antiapoptotic proteins during the course
of apoptosis might amplify and/or hasten cell death, it is not the
loss of those molecules that initially renders the lymphocytes
susceptible to the ganglioside. The expression levels of the
antiapoptotic proteins were not altered in GD3-treated resting

GD3 Efficiently Kills Activated but not Resting T Cells

cells, however, consistent with the resistance of naive T lymphocytes to GD3-induced caspase activation.
There are multiple mechanisms by which GD3 might negatively
regulate Bcl-xL, Ciap-2, and XIAP expression levels in a caspasedependent manner. Ganglioside-activated caspases might directly
degrade them, or a protease downstream of activated caspases
might be mediating the activity. It is also possible that only RelA is
cleaved (1), thus inhibiting the transcription of these NF-nB–
dependent, antiapoptotic molecules; indeed, caspase inhibitors
coincidentally rescued both RelA and the antiapoptotic proteins in
GD3-treated T cells. Arguing for direct caspase-dependent
proteolysis of Bcl-2 and Ciap-2 in GD3-treated activated T cells,
however, was the long-term stability of those proteins in the
presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that only inhibiting their
synthesis would not affect their expression levels within a 24-hour
time frame (data not shown). The degradation of RelA is ultimately
critical for GD3-induced apoptosis, however, because RelA overexpression by Jurkat cells is protective.
Our interest in the mechanism by which GD3 induces the
apoptosis of T cells stems in part from the role of tumor-derived
gangliosides in mediating immune dysfunction, thereby facilitating the progressive growth of the tumors that produce them. We
previously showed that the SK-RC-45 RCC line that overexpresses
GD3 was much more effective at inducing apoptosis in activated
T lymphocytes compared with resting T cells (3, 5) and also
showed that one of the most apoptogenic high-performance
liquid chromatography fractions of two glioma line–derived
ganglioside preparations contains GD1a and GD3 (23). This SKRC-45–mediated killing was inhibitable by PPPP and hence
dependent on its ganglioside production, and the fact that T-cell
death was accompanied by mitochondrial permeability (4),

cytochrome c release (2), and caspase-9 activation (2) collectively
suggested that tumor-induced lymphocyte death occurred at
least in part through the mitochondrial pathway. Precisely why
the SK-RC-45 tumor line selectively killed activated but not
resting T cells remained enigmatic, however, prompting this
comparative study of the GD3-induced effects on both cell types.
Although our results with GD3 cannot be generalized to all
gangliosides, given the unique molecular characteristics that
distinguish them, the effects of GD3 on activated and resting
T cells mirror those induced by SK-RC-45: both selectively kill
only activated T cells through the intrinsic pathway by a
mechanism that has ROS accumulation at the apex, and
proteolysis of antiapoptotic proteins as a means of amplifying
the response. Because the proapoptotic events leading to the
GD3-induced death of activated T cells are initiated by
ganglioside internalization, it seems likely that the resistance of
resting T lymphocytes to the apoptotic effects of the ganglioside
is based on the only inefficient internalization of the molecule by
those cells.
