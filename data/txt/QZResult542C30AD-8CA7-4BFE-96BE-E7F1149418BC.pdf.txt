Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor
Promotes Bone Metastasis That Can Be Blocked
with Osteoclast Inhibitors

Abstract
Hematopoietic growth factors are used to reverse chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. However, some factors such as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induce osteoclast-mediated bone
resorption that can promote cancer growth in the bone. Accordingly, we evaluated the ability of GM-CSF
to promote bone metastases of breast cancer or prostate cancer in a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced
leukopenia. In this model, GM-CSF reversed cyclophosphamide-induced leukopenia but also promoted breast
cancer and prostate cancer growth in the bone but not in soft tissue sites. Bone growth was associated with
the induction of osteoclastogenesis, yet in the absence of tumor GM-CSF, it did not affect osteoclastogenesis.
Two osteoclast inhibitors, the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid and the RANKL inhibitor osteoprotegerin, each
blocked GM-CSF–induced tumor growth in the bone but did not reverse the ability of GM-CSF to reverse
chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. Our findings indicate that it is possible to dissociate the bone-resorptive
effects of GM-CSF, to reduce metastatic risk, from the benefits of this growth factor in reversing leukopenia
caused by treatment with chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 70(12); 5014–23. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Over 5% of cancer patients have chemotherapy-induced
sepsis that is associated with 8.5% of all cancer deaths (1).
Granuloctye macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
is commonly used to reverse leukopenia (2, 3). In addition to its
prohematopoietic effects, GM-CSF has been shown to both
increase (4, 5) and decrease osteoclastogenesis (6–8). The
conflicting studies were resolved by the demonstration that
GM-CSF has a biphasic effect on osteoclast induction (9).
Specifically, it was shown that short-term exposure to GM-CSF
promotes osteoclastogenesis, whereas long-term exposure
inhibits osteoclastogenesis.
Bone metastasis is a frequent complication of cancers
including breast cancer and prostate cancer (10). Both breast
cancer and prostate cancer bone metastases have a boneresorptive component (i.e., osteolytic metastases). Increased
osteolytic activity promotes the development and progression of bone metastases (11). The increased osteolytic
activity is due to the tumor-mediated production of proosteoclastogenic factors that induce receptor activator NFκB

ligand (RANKL) expression (12). RANKL is a key inducer of
osteoclastogenesis through the activation of its cognate
receptor RANK that is present on osteoclast precursors (13).
Based on the observations that bone resorption promotes
bone metastasis and GM-CSF induces osteoclastogenesis, it
follows that GM-CSF administration to breast cancer or
prostate cancer patients may induce bone resorption that
promotes bone metastasis. However, the effect of GM-CSF
on osteoclastogenesis in the presence of leukopenia, as
occurs in patients receiving chemotherapy, is unknown.
Accordingly, to recapitulate the clinical scenario, we tested
if GM-CSF promotes cancer metastasis in the presence of
chemotherapy-induced leukopenia in a murine model.

Materials and Methods
Cells
MDA-231-lux, T47D, and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were
obtained from Dr. Stephen Ethier (Wayne State University,
Detroit, MI). MDA-231-lux was established by stably transfecting MDA-231 breast cancer cells with a constitutively active
promoter driving luciferase expression (14). PC-3-lux is a
prostate cancer cell line that contains a constitutively active
promoter driving luciferase expression (15). Cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.
Animal studies
All procedures were approved by the Animal Care
Committee. Eight-week-old nude mice (female for breast

cfm) to determine that 1.4 μg per mouse is equivalent
to the clinically used dose of 250 µg/m2. Cyclophosphamide was administered at 3 mg per mouse through the
i.p. route (16). Zoledronic acid (ZA; Novartis) was administered at 3 μg per mouse s.c. (17). Recombinant mouse
osteoprotegerin (OPG)/Fc chimeric protein (R&D Systems)
was administered at 2 mg/kg i.p. twice weekly (18). MDA231-lux or PC-3-lux were injected into the left cardiac
ventricle of mice as described (17, 19). This typically
results in 100% of mice having tumors in the bone and
25% of total tumor in mice being at the soft tissue sites
based on imaging and pathologic confirmation. To image
tumor, luciferin (40 mg/mL) was injected i.p, and images
were acquired 15 minutes postinjection using an IVIS
Imaging System (Caliper). Soft versus bone tissue lesions
were determined based on the location of luciferasepositive areas. For areas that were not clearly defined on
the original image, a perpendicular image of the animal
was taken. Total soft and skeletal tumor burdens per
mouse were calculated using the summation of individual
regions of luciferase-positive areas as described (17, 19).
For the measurement of osteoclast activity, serum tartrate–
resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b) was quantified
using mouse-specific TRACP 5B ELISA (IDS Ltd).
Cell counts
Blood was collected through retro-orbital puncture, and
total blood counts were performed using hemocytometer.
Differential counts were performed on whole blood smears
stained in Giemsa. For tumor cells, an aqueous cell viability
assay was used per the manufacturer's directions (Cell Titer96
Aqueous Solution Assay, Promega). This assay measures the
conversion of a tetrazolium salt (MTS) into a water-soluble
formazen compound using a spectrophotometer.
Measurement of bone lysis
Tibiae were radiographed using a Faxitron X-Ray unit
(Faxitron), were digitized, and the lytic area quantified as
previously described (20). Briefly, the entire area of the lateral
view of the bone is outlined to determine the total area, and
the lytic areas are outlined to determine the percent lytic
area. Bone mineral density (BMD) was quantified using
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry on an Eclipse peripheral
Dexa Scanner using the pDEXA Sabre research software
(Norland). Regions of interest were scanned at 2 mm/s and
0.1 mm × 0.1 mm resolution.
Bone histomorphometry
Bone samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin
at 4°C for 24 hours then dehydrated in ethanol. The bone
samples were processed, stained with modified Goldner stain,
and subjected to histomorphometry for osteoclast perimeter
and the percent of trabecular bone volume based on the total
tissue volume (BV/TV) of the tibia on a BIOQUANT system

www.aacrjournals.org

(R&M Biometrics, Inc.) as we have previously described (18).
For BV/TV, the average of the right and left leg values for
each animal was used.
Bone marrow cultures for osteoclastogenesis
evaluation
To obtain bone marrow cells, tibiae were aseptically
removed, ends were cut, and marrow cavity was flushed into
a dish by injecting MEM into the proximal end using a 21-g
needle. The bone marrow suspension was agitated to obtain
a single-cell suspension; cells were washed twice, resuspended in MEM containing 10% FBS, and incubated for
24 hours (3 × 105 cells/mL) in a 75-cm2 flask. After 24 hours,
nonadherent cells were harvested; resuspended (106/mL) in
MEM-FBS; and cultured in 100 μL of MEM containing 10%
FBS, nonessential amino acids, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and
sRANKL (125 ng/mL) in 96-well plates. In some instances,
GM-CSF was added at 10 ng/mL as described. Cells were incubated for 14 days, and 50% of the media were refreshed
every 3 day.
Statistics
Data were analyzed with the StatView Software (Abacus
Concepts). A one-way ANOVA analysis was used with
Bonferroni's post hoc analysis for comparison between multiple groups. A Student's t test was used for comparison
between two groups. Significance was defined as a P value
of <0.05.

Results
Establishment of a murine model of GM-CSF rescue of
chemotherapy-induced leukopenia
To establish a model of leukopenia and GM-CSF rescue,
we administered cyclophosphamide followed by rmGM-CSF
3 days postcyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide induced
leukopenia with the nadir at 3 days (Fig. 1). Administration of rmGM-CSF at day 3 postcyclophosphamide resulted
in normal leukocyte levels at 3 days after the nadir compared with 12 days for the mice that received vehicle. Administration of rmGM-CSF induced leukocytosis that
normalized at 15 days postadministration. Cyclophosphamide reduced both neutrophils and monocytes, and this
was reversed rapidly by the administration of rmGM-CSF.
Taken together, these data show that the administration of
cyclophosphamide serves as a functional model of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia that can be reversed by
rmGM-CSF.
GM-CSF promotes MDA-231 growth in the bone but not
in soft tissue
Murine and human GM-CSFs do not cross-react with the
other species' receptors (21). Thus, rmGM-CSF should have
no direct effect on human breast cancer or prostate cancer
cells. To confirm this, we incubated cancer cells with
rmGM-CSF and found that it did not affect breast cancer
or prostate cancer growth (Fig. 2A). To determine the effect

increased tumor growth in the bone, but not soft tissue, compared with vehicle administration (Fig. 2B and C). The
rmGM-CSF–induced increase in tumor bone volume was
associated with an increase in the number of bone but not
soft tissue metastases (Fig. 2D), which reflected that all sites
of skeletal disease were affected by rmGM-CSF. To determine
the effect on the interaction between tumor and bone, we
evaluated several parameters of bone remodeling. Specifically, radiographs were used to observe the lytic area and
densitometry was used to evaluate the BMD, which is an
index of how much mineralized matrix is present, and serum

levels of TRACP5b that reflects overall osteoclast activity. In
the absence of tumor, rmGM-CSF did not alter the lytic area,
BMD, TRACP5b, or metaphyseal trabeculae (Fig. 3). Tumor
alone induced osteolysis, reduced BMD, increased serum
TRACP5b, and decreased metaphyseal trabeculae by ∼44%.
Administration of rmGM-CSF, in the presence of tumor, increased the lytic area by ∼90%, reduced BMD compared with
tumor alone, induced further increases of serum TRACP5b,
and resulted in the greater loss of metaphyseal trabeculae
(i.e., total of 56% versus 44%) compared with tumor alone.
Taken together, these results indicate that GM-CSF administration promotes MDA-231 cell growth specifically in the
bone, which is associated with increased bone-resorptive
(i.e., osteoclastic) activity.

GM-CSF Promotes Bone Metastasis

GM-CSF promotes MDA-231–induced
osteoclastogenesis
To determine the role of GM-CSF directly on osteoclast
activity versus tumor-induced osteoclast activity, we next
determined the effect of rmGM-CSF administration on osteoclastogenesis in the context of tumor. In the absence of
tumor, rmGM-CSF had no effect on osteoclast numbers
(i.e., osteoclast perimeter; Fig. 4A). In contrast, tumor alone
increased osteoclast perimeter, which was further increased
by rmGM-CSF (Fig. 4A). To determine if GM-CSF directly
affected osteoclastogenesis, we obtained marrow stromal
cells from mice with or without intrafemoral MDA-231
tumor growth and incubated them with rmGM-CSF. Marrow
stromal cells derived from mice with intraosseous tumor
produced more osteoclasts than stromal cells derived from
mice without tumor (Fig. 4B). However, administration of
rmGM-CSF in vitro had no effect on the osteoclast numbers
produced by marrow stromal cells derived from mice with or
without tumor present in the bone (Fig. 4B). These results
were consistent with the increased osteolysis and osteoclast
perimeter induced by the presence of tumor; however, they
seemed to conflict with the in vivo results that showed
GM-CSF increased osteoclast perimeter in the presence of
tumor (Fig. 4A). One possibility was that the increase of
osteoclasts occurs in vivo only in the presence of tumors.
To determine if GM-CSF induced an increase of osteoclast
production in vivo in the presence of tumors, we injected

mice with saline or MDA-231 cells, let tumors become established over 14 days, then administered GM-CSF or vehicle,
and, after 24 hours, collected bone marrow cells to evaluate
their osteoclastogenic potential. In the absence of tumor,
GM-CSF had no effect on osteoclast numbers; however, in
the presence of tumor, GM-CSF induced an increase in bone
marrow-stromal–derived osteoclasts that were observed at 3
and 7 days post–GM-CSF administration (Fig. 4C and D).
Taken together, these results indicate that GM-CSF promotes
osteoclastogenesis indirectly with a requirement for tumor
presence in vivo.
Inhibition of osteoclastogenesis blocks
GM-CSF–induced MDA-231 cell growth in bone
That GM-CSF had no direct effect on breast cancer cell
proliferation in vitro (Fig. 2A) suggested that it promotes
breast cancer growth through an indirect mechanism in vivo.
The induction of bone remodeling promotes the ability of
cancers, including breast cancer and prostate cancer, to grow
in bone (17, 22, 23). Accordingly, we assessed if blocking
GM-CSF–induced osteoclastogenesis would prevent GMCSF–induced breast cancer growth in bone. To accomplish
this, the bisphosphonate ZA or vehicle was administered.
After 2 weeks, MDA-231 cells were injected into the left
cardiac ventricle, and GM-CSF or vehicle was administered
3 days later. Tumor burden was monitored over 6 weeks.
As observed earlier, GM-CSF administration promoted tumor

growth in the bone (Fig. 5A). Pretreatment with ZA inhibited the GM-CSF–induced tumor growth. ZA alone also inhibited tumor growth. There was no difference in the levels
of tumor growth between ZA alone compared with ZA in
the presence of GM-CSF. Finally, ZA had no effect on
MDA-231 growth in soft tissue in the presence or absence
of GM-CSF (Fig. 5A). Taken together, these data indicate
that ZA blocks the GM-CSF effect through a mechanism
that is specific to the bone microenvironment and is consistent with the concept that GM-CSF mediates its protumorigenic effects in the bone through the induction of
osteoclastogenesis.

ZA can block GM-CSF–induced intraosseous MDA-231
growth without blocking the ability of GM-CSF to
reverse leukopenia
GM-CSF is administered during periods of chemotherapyinduced leukopenia that occurs secondary to the destruction
of cycling progenitor marrow cells. It is unclear if this
destruction also affects osteoclast production. To explore
this uncertainty and recapitulate the clinical situation, we
assessed if GM-CSF affects cancer growth in the bone in
the presence of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. Mice
were treated with ZA (or vehicle), and 2 weeks later, MDA-231
cancer cells were injected into the left cardiac ventricle and

GM-CSF Promotes Bone Metastasis

Figure 4. GM-CSF requires the presence of tumor to promote osteolysis in vivo. A, MDA-231-lux cells were injected (1 × 106 cells/10 μL of PBS) into
the left cardiac ventricle of mice, and either saline vehicle or GM-CSF (1.4 μg/mouse I.P.) was initiated. Tumor growth was monitored over a period of 6 wk.

quantified. Columns, mean osteoclasts per well; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05 versus no tumor. C and D, MDA-231-lux cells (or saline vehicle) were injected

was collected by flushing the tibiae at the indicated time points. Marrows were subjected to culturing and osteoclasts were identified as in B. Points,

cyclophosphamide was administered at the same time. Three
days after the administration of cyclophosphamide, GM-CSF
(or vehicle) was administered and animals were followed
over 6 weeks using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Even in
the presence of cyclophosphamide, GM-CSF induced cancer
growth in the bone and ZA inhibited this (Fig. 5B). To
confirm the presence of leukopenia, we performed whole
blood cell counts (WBC). As anticipated, leukopenia was
present 3 days postcyclophosphamide administration.
GM-CSF reversed the leukopenia within 6 days after its administration, whereas the mice that did not receive GM-CSF
still had moderate leukopenia at this time point (neutropenia
paralleled the total WBC; data not shown; Fig. 5C). By day 21,
all groups had normal WBCs. To determine if the presence of
osteolytic activity reflected the presence of tumor and GM-CSF
in this clinical model, we measured osteoclast perimeter and
TRACP5b. Even in the presence of the chemotherapy-induced
leukopenia that occurred at day 3, at the end of the study at 6
weeks, administration of GM-CSF at day 3 induced an increase
in osteoclast perimeter that was observed as late as 6 weeks

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 5D). Administration of ZA blocked the GM-CSF induction
of osteoclast perimeter. The induction of osteoclast activity by
GM-CSF and its inhibition by ZA was reflected by serum
TRACP5b levels (Fig. 5D). In summary, mice receiving chemotherapy developed leukopenia at day 3, at which time GM-CSF
was administered, which resolved the leukopenia by day 9 and
was associated with increased osteoclast perimeter at week 6.
Furthermore, treatment with ZA before the administration of
GM-CSF did not inhibit GM-CSF's restoration of the WBC but
did inhibit the GM-CSF–induced tumor growth and increase
of osteoclast perimeter.
ZA or OPG can block GM-CSF–induced intraosseous
PC-3-lux growth without blocking the ability of GM-CSF
to reverse leukopenia
To determine if these results were specific to breast cancer
or relevant to other cancers, we used PC-3 prostate cancer
cells. Furthermore, to evaluate if the inhibitory effects on
tumor growth were specific to ZA, we used an additional
method to inhibit osteoclast activity. Specifically, we treated

cancer cell line, in the presence of cyclophosphamide, GM-CSF
induced cancer growth in the bone (Fig. 6A, see GM-CSF−
ZA−/OPG− versus GM-CSF+ ZA−/OPG−). As previously observed for MDA-231, ZA inhibited GM-CSF–induced cancer
growth (Fig. 6A, see GM-CSF+ ZA−/OPG− versus GM-CSF+
ZA+). Similarly, OPG had a potent inhibitory effect on GMCSF–induced cancer growth as did ZA (Fig. 6A, see GM-CSF+
ZA−/OPG− versus GM-CSF+ OPG+). GM-CSF reversed the
cyclophosphamide-induced leukopenia in the presence of
PC-3-lux, and ZA or OPG with kinetics similar to that
observed for MDA-231 (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that
both ZA and OPG can inhibit GM-CSF–mediated tumor
growth in bone whereas having no effect on the ability of
GM-CSF to reverse leukopenia. To determine if the presence
of osteolytic activity reflected the presence of tumor and
GM-CSF in this PC-3 prostate cancer model of the clinical
scenario, we measured osteoclast perimeter and TRACP5b.
Even in the presence of the chemotherapy-induced leukope-

nia that occurs at day 3, at the end of the study at 9 weeks,
administration of GM-CSF at day 3 induced an increase in
osteoclast perimeter that was observed as late as 9 weeks.
Administration of ZA or OPG blocked the GM-CSF induction
of osteoclast perimeter (Fig. 6C). The induction of osteoclast
activity by GM-CSF and its inhibition by ZA or OPG was
reflected by serum TRACP5b levels (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
In the current study, we uncovered a previously unidentified
risk associated with the administration of GM-CSF for the
treatment of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. Specifically,
our work shows that the administration of GM-CSF to reverse
chemotherapy-induced leukopenia promotes the growth of
breast cancer and prostate cancer in the bone through the
induction of osteoclast activity. Furthermore, we identified that
the administration of an osteoclast inhibitor in conjunction

with GM-CSF diminishes the induction of metastasis. The
ability to dissociate the prometastatic osteoclastogenic activity from the ability to reverse leukopenia provides a potential
therapeutic approach to diminish the morbidity associated
with chemotherapy-induced leukopenia without adding
additional therapy-induced risk for tumor progression.
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and GMCSF are frequently administered to reverse chemotherapyinduced neutropenia (26, 27). G-CSF has osteoclastic effects
and prometastatic effects in the bone (28); however, the
effects of GM-CSF on osteoclastogenesis in the context of
tumor were less known. Several studies have shown that
GM-CSF inhibits osteoclastogenesis in vitro, whereas other reports have shown that GM-CSF stimulates osteoclastogenesis
(5, 9, 29). Of particular note is that short-term administration
of GM-CSF, similar to how it would be used in the clinical scenario, was shown to induce osteoclasts in a murine model (29).
One potential reason for the conflicting results was that the
latter studies were performed in the face of an inflammatory
environment in which a variety of cytokines are present, which
could confer a proosteoclastogenic effect on GM-CSF. We
have previously reported that some breast cancer cells produce GM-CSF that promotes bone metastasis through the
induction of osteoclastogenesis (30), which led to the supposition that the administration of GM-CSF may promote the
same prometastatic osteoclastogenic activity (31). In the current study, GM-CSF was administered in the context of cancer.
This suggests that the cancer cells themselves provided factors
that conferred proosteoclastogenic activity on GM-CSF. Another possibility is that the tumor microenvironment itself
may be proinflammatory through the stromal production of
cytokines and migration of leukocytes into the tumor (32).
Thus, the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment may
have conferred proosteoclastogenic activity on GM-CSF.
In light of the observation that increased bone resorption
promotes bone metastasis (33) and the possibility that GMCSF induces bone resorption through osteoclastogenesis,
we hypothesized that administration of GM-CSF during
chemotherapy-induced leukopenia would promote bone
metastasis. We showed that although murine GM-CSF had no
direct effect on human cancer cells, administration of mGMCSF promoted growth of cancer in the bone but not in soft
tissue. These results are consistent with the observations that
(a) ZA had no effect on prostate cancer growth in soft tissues
whereas it inhibited growth in bone in vivo (34), and (b) ZA
inhibited tumor-induced osteolysis and is directly proportional
to tumor burden (17). This indicates that GM-CSF promotes
receptivity of the bone but not soft tissue microenvironments
for cancer establishment. This occurred in a background of
chemotherapy-induced leukopenia, which makes it clinically
relevant. This suggests that clinical administration of GM-CSF

to reverse chemotherapy-induced leukopenia may ultimately
promote bone metastasis in patients. Our results are consistent
with the observation that G-CSF, a known inducer of osteoclast
activity, was shown to induce tumor growth in the bone in a
murine model through a dependency on osteoclasts (28).
Several lines of evidence indicated that GM-CSF promoted
osteoclast activity in our model system including increased
serum TRACP, radiographic osteolysis, osteoclast perimeter,
and decreased BMD. The induction of osteoclast activity
seemed critical for the development of tumor growth in the
bone. That ZA inhibited both bone resorption and tumor
growth in the bone, but not in soft tissue, indicated that ZA
indirectly inhibited tumor growth through the bone microenvironment. This seems to be in conflict with the previous findings that ZA directly induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells
(35, 36) and prostate cancer cells (37, 38) in vitro. However, the
direct cytotoxic effects of bisphosphonates is controversial as
several studies indicate that bisphosphonates have no proapoptotic effect (39) or were inconclusive (40) and the lack of
antitumor effects upon bisphosphonates administration clinically (33). That OPG inhibited GM-CSF–induced tumor
growth similarly to ZA provides further support that the antitumor effect is mediated through the bone microenvironment
as opposed to directly by ZA. In support of this possibility is
the previous report that OPG has no direct effect on prostate
cancer cell growth in vitro or at soft tissue sites in vivo (18).
In summary, we have shown that the administration of
GM-CSF in a model of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia
promotes the establishment of cancer growth in the bone.
Furthermore, we determined that the use of osteoclast inhibitors were able to dissociate the osteoclastic activity from the
proleukocytic activity, allowing for the rapid restoration of
leukocyte numbers while blocking the GM-CSF–induced
growth of tumor in the bone. These findings suggest that careful
consideration should be given for the potential effect on tumor
progression that clinical use of GM-CSF (and presumably
G-CSF) for chemotherapy-induced leukopenia could have. Furthermore, this study indicates that methods to reverse leukopenia without promoting osteoclastogenesis should be developed.
