BACKGROUND: The authors explored the association of skin toxicity (ST) severity as measured by patientreported ST and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading with efficacy of panitumumab, a fully human antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibody, from a phase 3 metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) trial. METHODS: Patients were randomized to panitumumab plus best supportive care
(BSC) vs BSC alone. ST by modified National Cancer Institute CTCAE v3.0 and modified Dermatology Life
Quality Index (mDLQI), health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and CRC symptoms were measured. ST was
analyzed using a landmark approach. Associations by KRAS mutational status were also assessed.
RESULTS: Of 463 patients, 208 of 231 (90%) panitumumab patients and 184 of 232 (79%) BSC patients
had 1 postbaseline patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessment. Panitumumab patients with more severe
ST had significantly longer overall survival (OS) (grade 2-4:grade 1; hazard ratio, 0.60; P ¼ .0033). Lower
mDLQI scores (<67; more bothersome ST) were associated with longer OS (Cox model, P < .0001). Similar
results were observed with progression-free survival (PFS). An inverse relation between mDLQI and
HRQOL scores was observed, suggesting that ST bother correlated with better HRQOL. KRAS and PRO
data were available in 363 patients (188 panitumumab; 175 BSC). Longer OS was associated with lower
mDLQI scores, regardless of KRAS status. Longer PFS was associated with more severe ST (lower mDLQI
scores and higher CTCAE grade ST) in patients with wild-type (WT) KRAS tumors, but not in patients with
mutant KRAS tumors. CONCLUSIONS: More severe ST, by both clinical grading and PRO, is associated with
better CRC symptoms and HRQOL and with longer OS and PFS among panitumumab-treated patients. The
associations for PFS were more pronounced in patients with WT KRAS tumors. Cancer 2009;115:1544–54.

Skin Toxicity, PRO, and Efficacy/Peeters et al

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
malignancy in the United States and Europe and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths.1 In the
past decade, significant progress has been made in the treatment of CRC patients.2-9 The advent of targeted therapies
such as vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors has resulted in
improved clinical outcomes.2-5 Today, sequential therapy
is the standard of care in advanced disease, and is associated
with an overall survival (OS) of over 20 months with available new therapies.5 Unfortunately, treatment failure,
symptomatic progression, and death are still eventualities
for most patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC).
Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against EGFR, and is indicated for use in
patients with mCRC who progress on or after standard
chemotherapy.2,10-12 Skin toxicity (ST) is the most common side effect associated with EGFR inhibitors. In general, skin-related toxicities are more frequent in patients
treated with monoclonal antibodies (approximately 90%)
than in patients treated with small molecules (approximately 60%).2,4,13,14 The pathogenesis of integumentrelated toxicity associated with anti-EGFR therapies is not
fully understood. The EGFR is highly expressed in keratinocytes, skin follicles, and hair follicles, and inhibition of
EGFR signaling in these cell types results in apoptosis.13-16
ST severity has been shown to be associated with efficacy in
patients with mCRC receiving anti-EGFR therapy.2,4,14
Independent of tumor type and tumor EGFR status, a
strong correlation between the intensity of skin rash and
patient outcomes has been observed.2-4,17
A phase 3, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial
demonstrated that panitumumab plus best supportive
care (BSC) improved progression-free survival (PFS)
compared with BSC alone in patients with chemorefractory mCRC.2 Subsequently, a biomarker analysis using
data from the phase 3 trial was conducted and showed
that wild-type KRAS status was required for panitumumab efficacy.18 The exploratory analyses presented herein
were performed to evaluate the association of ST severity,
as measured by both toxicity grade (National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events [CTCAE] v3.0) and patient-reported ST, with
PFS, OS, disease-related symptoms, and health-related
quality of life (HRQOL). Associations by KRAS mutational status were also evaluated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of panitumumab 6.0 mg/kg twice per week plus BSC (panitumumab)
compared with BSC alone (BSC) in patients with mCRC
that had progressed on prior fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin therapy (Fig. 1).2 Relevant inclusion
criteria included pathologic diagnosis of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) score 0-2, radiologic documentation of
disease progression during or within 6 months after the
last administration of fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and
oxaliplatin, 2 or 3 prior chemotherapy regimens, EGFR
membrane staining on 1% tumor cells by immunohistochemistry at a central laboratory, adequate hematologic,
renal, and hepatic function, and no symptomatic brain
metastases. Patients were stratified by ECOG score (0-1
vs 2), and geographic region (Western Europe vs Central
and Eastern Europe vs the rest of the world).
The primary endpoint of the study was PFS per
blinded central radiology tumor assessment using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria at specified time points from Weeks 8
to 48, and every 3 months thereafter until disease progression. Responses were confirmed no less than 4 weeks after
the response criteria were first met. At the discretion of
the investigator, patients could be evaluated for radiographic tumor assessment after developing symptoms
consistent with disease progression. BSC patients determined by the investigator to have disease progression were
allowed to receive panitumumab under a separate crossover study. Secondary endpoints were OS time and best

overall objective response by central radiology, safety
(including ST severity), patient-reported ST, diseaserelated symptoms, and HRQOL.
The assay to detect KRAS mutations has been previously described.18 Briefly, DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor sections, and KRAS
mutations in codons 12 and 13 were detected using a validated KRAS mutation kit (DxS Ltd, Manchester, UK). A
blinded central laboratory conducted the KRAS analysis.
KRAS mutational status was ascertained in 427 (92%) of
all patients randomized in the study.

Patient-reported Outcome Assessments
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments were
obtained at baseline, every 2 weeks or monthly during the
treatment phase of the study, and at the 30-day safety follow-up visit (Table 1). Patient-reported ST was measured
using the modified Dermatology Life Quality Index
(mDLQI); CRC cancer symptoms were measured using
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network/Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Colorectal Symptom Index (FCSI); HRQOL was measured using the
1546

European Profile of Quality of Life (EUROQOL) Health
Index (EQ-5D), the EUROQOL Visual Analog Scale
(EQ-VAS), and the European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 Global
Health Status/QOL Scale.
The mDLQI consists of 3 items measuring the
degree of bother with skin conditions.19,20 Scores range
from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating less problems/
bother. The FCSI is a brief symptom index comprised of
clinically relevant symptoms for assessing symptomatic
response to treatment for CRC.21 Scores range from 0 to
100, with higher scores indicating less CRC symptomatology. The EQ-5D is a generic preference-based measure
of overall quality of life (QOL) across 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and
anxiety or depression.22 Each dimension has 3 possible
outcomes (no problems, moderate problems, and extreme
problems). Scores range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating
death and 1 indicating perfect health. The EQ-VAS measures current health status.23 Scores range from 0 to 100,
with 0 representing the worst imaginable health state, and
100 representing the best imaginable health state assessed
on a vertical scale. The EORTC QLQ-C30 Global
Cancer

Health Status/QOL Scale is a 2-item subscale of the
EORTC QLQ-C30 measuring health status and overall
QOL.24 Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores
indicating better HRQOL.
Linear transformation was used to standardize the
raw score of all the PRO instruments as per defined scoring algorithms.
Statistical Analysis
The primary study endpoint was PFS by blinded central
radiology assessment of modified RECIST criteria. The
primary analysis of PFS included tumor assessments after
crossover to panitumumab for BSC patients if disease progression had not been centrally confirmed while the
patient was receiving BSC alone. Secondary endpoints
included OS time and best overall objective response by
blinded central review. Statistical analyses for the primary
and secondary endpoints were previously described.2
The primary analysis of PRO used analysis of covariance to estimate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the
least squares (LS) adjusted means within and between the
panitumumab and BSC groups for the time-adjusted area
under the curve (AUC) for the mDLQI, FCSI, and EQ5D scales. Means were adjusted for baseline score, randomization stratification factors, and baseline collection
medium (paper vs electronic).
The objective of these exploratory analyses was to
evaluate the association of ST severity per CTCAE grading criteria and mDLQI scores with PFS, OS, diseaserelated symptoms, and HRQOL in the panitumumab
patients. To account for lead-time bias and under-reporting of ST because of early treatment discontinuation, a
landmark approach was used that limited the analysis to
patients with a PFS time of at least 28 days having at least
grade 1 ST (as per CTCAE grading criteria). For PRO
analyses, patients were excluded if they had no postbaseline PRO assessments (the PRO All Enrolled analysis set).
The above associations were also evaluated by KRAS
status.
For PFS and OS analyses, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relation between ST
severity (as measured by mDLQI scores or graded by
CTCAE) and time to event. By mDLQI scores, dichotomization of PFS for degree of being bothered was
explored using all possible cutpoints of mDLQI (based on
the effect size from a Cox model) to find the maximum

difference by mDLQI score. PFS was defined as the time
from randomization to the earliest radiologic disease progression per modified RECIST by blinded central review
or death with censoring at the last complete tumor assessment. Time to death was measured from the time of randomization with censoring at date of last contact. Pearson
correlation coefficients were used to examine the association among patient-reported ST (minimum postbaseline
mDLQI bother score) with median postbaseline PROs.
Kruskall-Wallis and Terpstra-Jonckheere tests were used
to examine general and ordered associations, respectively,
between ST severity and the minimum postbaseline
mDLQI score.
Time to onset of the first grade 2 or higher ST was
modeled as a time-dependent covariate in separate Cox
models for PFS and OS among all randomized patients
with indicators for their randomization factors. Time to
onset was examined at any time, and in 1- to 2-month
increments with a piece-wise model. Months were calculated by multiplying the number of days by 12 of 364.25.
P values presented here are descriptive and not adjusted
for multiplicity.
Missing PRO data were imputed using 2 methods,
the last value carried forward (LVCF) method and the
slope method.25,26 For the LVCF method, missing observations were replaced with the last value or zero value at
death. For the slope method, a forward linear interpolation of observed data was used to impute missing data.

RESULTS
Patients
In this phase 3 trial, 231 patients were randomized to panitumumab and 232 patients to BSC.2 The patient characteristics from this trial have been previously reported.2
Median follow-up time for all patients was 29 months
(range, 24-38 months), and for 39 surviving patients it
was 28 months (range, 24-36 months). In the BSC group,
176 (76%) patients received panitumumab under the
crossover study.12 The PRO analysis set included 208
(90%) panitumumab patients and 184 (79%) BSC
patients with at least 1 postbaseline PRO assessment (Table 2). A higher percentage of panitumumab patients had
evaluable PRO data compared with the BSC group from
Week 4 onward. This was expected from the higher rate

of discontinuation because of disease progression in the
BSC group. At Week 4, data for the mDLQI, EQ-5D,
and EORTC instruments were available for approximately 90% of panitumumab patients and 70% of BSC
patients; by Week 16, data were available for 30% and
4% of patients, respectively.
Among all patients treated with panitumumab (n ¼
229), 209 (91%) patients had grade 1 or higher ST; 158
(69%) patients had grade 2-4, and 51 (22%) patients had
grade 1. The median time to the most severe ST was 15
days (95% CI, 14-16).
For the PRO analysis set, 363 patients with KRAS
status were included (188 panitumumab patients; 175
BSC patients). Of the panitumumab patients, 76 patients
had mutant KRAS, and 112 patients had wild-type KRAS.
Of the BSC patients, 79 patients had mutant KRAS, and
96 patients had wild-type KRAS.
Primary Analysis of Patient-reported
Skin Toxicity (mDLQI), CRC Symptoms,
and HRQOL
For the mDLQI, panitumumab patients had a lower
time-adjusted AUC compared with BSC patients in the
1548

primary PRO analysis, indicating that these patients were
more bothered by their skin condition than the BSC
group (data not shown). The LS-adjusted mean difference
in scores for panitumumab minus BSC was 22.0 (95%
CI, 28.0 to 16.1). A difference in favor of BSC was
expected, given the incidence and severity of ST seen with
EGFR inhibitors.
A numerical trend in favor of panitumumab was
observed for the primary PRO analysis of AUC using the
FCSI and EQ-5D instruments (data not shown).
Association of Skin Toxicity Measures
in the Panitumumab Patients
Within the panitumumab group, patients with the worst
grade ST reported lower mDLQI scores (more bothered
by their skin condition). The minimum postbaseline
mDLQI score was inversely associated with the worst
grade of ST (Kruskal-Wallis and Terpstra-Jonckheere
tests, P < .001). For patients with a worst ST of grade 1,
2, and 3, median (mean) postbaseline mDLQI scores (0100 scale, where 0 represented most bothered by ST) were
67 (71), 56 (48), and 33 (38), respectively. The median
changes in scores from baseline for patients with a worst
ST of grade 1, 2, or 3 ranged from 0.35 to 0.74 for the
EQ-5D, from 50 to 71 for the EQ-VAS, from 50 to 71
for the EORTC global scale, and from 64 to 78 for the
FCSI. These were clinically important differences based
on the minimum clinically important difference for each
scale as previously reported.27
Association of Skin Toxicity With PFS
Increased ST severity by CTCAE was associated with
more favorable outcomes. Longer PFS was observed in
patients with worst ST of grade 2 to 4 compared with
those with a worst grade of 1 (hazard ratio [HR] [grade 24:grade 1], 0.63 95% CI, 0.45-0.88; P ¼ .0063) (Fig.
2A). Among all patients, time of onset of grade 2 ST as
a time-dependent covariate was associated with a lower
progression rate (HR, 0.71; P ¼ .0230) and particularly
an onset within the first 2 months (HR, 0.63; P ¼ .0126);
however, analysis beyond 2 months is limited, because
only 10 (4%) of patients had grade 2 onset after this
time (Table 3).
The analysis of PFS by ST severity based on KRAS
status included 182 panitumumab patients (72 patients

significant (P ¼ .0002) in a Cox model for OS, with a
lower (more bothered) mDLQI score being associated
with prolonged OS (Fig. 3B).

Grade 2-4 ST was associated with longer OS compared
with grade 1 (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.85; P ¼ .0033)
(Fig. 3A). Among all patients, time of onset of grade 2
ST was associated with a lower death rate (HR, 0.63; P ¼
.0034) and particularly an onset within the first 4 months;
however, the analysis is limited because only 2 (1%)
patients had grade 2 onset after 2 months (Table 4).
A nonsignificant difference in OS in favor of
patients with grade 2-4 ST was seen regardless of KRAS
status. Time of onset of grade 2 ST was associated with
a lower death rate with onset at any time (HR, 0.58; 95%

Additional evidence of the association between improved
outcomes and worsening STs is shown in Table 5. The
minimum postbaseline observed value for the mDLQI
was inversely correlated with the median postbaseline
observed value for the EQ-5D index (P ¼ .0003) and the
EQ-VAS (P ¼ .0268). A nonsignificant trend for an
inverse correlation between mDLQI and EORTC QLQC30 Global Health Status/QOL Scale and the mDLQI
and FCSI scores was also observed. As expected, statistically significant direct correlations were observed between

Patients with mCRC that failed to improve on standard
chemotherapy including 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and
oxaliplatin progress rapidly to develop symptoms that
impact HRQOL. In this study we also explored the association between symptomatic patient-reported ST and both

bothered by their ST reported higher HRQOL scores
with panitumumab therapy.

The association between ST and PFS was only seen
for panitumumab patients with wild-type KRAS. No association between ST and PFS was seen in the mutant KRAS
group, which is consistent with the findings from the biomarker analysis recently reported.18 Of note, a higher
incidence of grade 3 ST was observed in patients with
wild-type KRAS tumors as compared with mutant KRAS,
consistent with longer time on treatment. With regards to
OS, the association with ST severity was more pronounced for the wild-type KRAS vs the mutant KRAS
group. In the KRAS mutant group, given the lack of overall clinical benefit, there is no clear explanation for the
apparent differences in OS by incidence of grade 2 ST
within the first 4 months. This most likely reflects inherent bias related to observation time, which is not controlled by the landmark analysis given that time to severe
toxicity exceeded 28 days in 73% of patients. Indeed, no
1552

correlation was found between OS and the incidence of
grade 2 ST at any time in patients with mutant KRAS.
These analyses represent nonrandomized comparisons, and therefore do not necessarily suggest a causal relation between ST and outcomes. Patients remaining longer
on study because of treatment benefit are more likely to
develop ST. Although lead time bias is minimized by the
use of a landmark approach, it is not completely eliminated, as severity of ST increases with time, beyond the
initial 4 weeks of therapy accounted for in the analyses.
However, consistent results were found based on Cox
models with time of grade 2 ST onset at any time as a
time-dependent covariate, which provided a possibly less
biased alternative assessment. Whether ST is a surrogate
marker of efficacy or an association related to time-onstudy cannot be ascertained from this study. Recent data
obtained with the antibody cetuximab suggest that there

is a biological correlation between ST and outcomes. In
that trial, increasing the dose of cetuximab in patients
with a low degree of ST resulted in increased treatment efficacy.17 Reasons underlying a biological phenomenon
could include higher antibody exposure and EGFR saturation in tumor occurring in patients with more severe
rash, suggesting a correlation between EGFR presence in
skin and tumor.
An additional limitation of these analyses relates to
the degree of missing HRQOL data. Missing data for
PROs were largely because of disease progression (which
caused patient-reported data collection to be halted) in
this advanced-stage population, especially among the
BSC patients. Of these, 70% had disease progression by
Week 8 (and subsequently crossed over to panitumumab
therapy in the extension trial). By using either of the 2 imputation methods, LVCF and slope, the true effect on the
PROs by treatment may have been underestimated. With
the LVCF method, imputation of data halts potential outcome deterioration, as it carries forward the predropout
value throughout the study, with zero carried forward at
death. This method may bias the results in favor of a treatment that results in dropouts associated with morbidity or
progression. In this case, it can result in bias by imputing
potentially higher scores in the BSC patients than the panitumumab patients. In some settings, the slope method
may be more conservative and less biased toward either
treatment group. These limitations do not seem to have
affected the overall findings, as results were consistent
across imputation methods. However, these imputation
methods ignore the effect of panitumumab received after
crossover on PROs, as these endpoints were not measured
in the crossover extension trial.
Although ST represents a marker of clinical benefit
in patients treated with EGFR inhibitors, its utility in the
clinical setting is limited, as it cannot be used a priori to
select patients who may derive greater benefit from antiEGFR treatment, or conversely, exclude those who may
not. If a biological mechanism underlies this association,
this marker could be used clinically to titrate treatment
doses to achieve an ST grade consistent with maximum
treatment benefit, as suggested by results obtained with
the antibody cetuximab.17 However, as a predictor of
response, this biomarker has significant limitations.
Although the majority of patients develop ST, only a subset of patients derive benefit from treatment. Therefore,
Cancer

there is a need to identify biomarkers of high predictive
value that can identify patients most likely to benefit from
these agents. We recently reported that patients whose
tumors contain mutations in KRAS do not derive benefit
from panitumumab.18 Our analyses by KRAS status
reported herein are consistent with the initial findings that
correlated KRAS status with PFS and response rate, and
further reinforce that KRAS genotyping should be considered in patients receiving panitumumab monotherapy for
the treatment of mCRC. Other biomarkers such as the
expression of EGFR ligands in the tumor may also
improve patient selection.28,29 The relation between ST
incidence and severity and the presence of these biomarkers should be studied prospectively.
In conclusion, panitumumab monotherapy is active
in a subset of patients with heavily pretreated mCRC.
Although some degree of ST is seen in most patients, better clinical outcomes including HRQOL are associated
with higher grades of STs, as measured by both grading
criteria and PRO. The predictive role of ST and KRAS
mutational status for the selection of patients more likely
to benefit from panitumumab should be studied prospectively in controlled trials.
