REVIEW

Targeting genetic alterations in protein methyltransferases
for personalized cancer therapeutics
RA Copeland, MP Moyer and VM Richon
The human protein methyltransferases (PMTs) constitute a large enzyme class composed of two families, the protein lysine
methyltransferases (PKMTs) and the protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). Examples have been reported of both PKMTs and
PRMTs that are genetically altered in speciﬁc human cancers, and in several cases these alterations have been demonstrated to
confer a unique dependence of the cancer cells on PMT enzymatic activity for the tumorigenic phenotype. Examples of such
driver alterations in PMTs will be presented together with a review of current efforts towards the discovery and development
of small-molecule inhibitors of these enzymes as personalized cancer therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION
Genetic material is packaged within the nuclei of cells in the form
of chromatin, a noncovalent complex of chromosomal DNA and
the core nucleosomal histone proteins around which the DNA is
wrapped (Figure 1a). The tightly condensed chromatin (referred to
as heterochromatin) thus allows large amounts of chromosomal
DNA to be packaged within the relatively small volume of the
cellular nucleus. Activated gene transcription is enabled by
conformational changes that permit the access of transcriptional
machinery (that is, transcription factors, polymerases and the like)
to speciﬁc gene promoters by de-condensing the chromatin
(referred to as euchromatin; Figure 1b). The conformational
transition between euchromatin and heterochromatin states is
controlled by a collection of posttranslational modiﬁcation of the
histone proteins and covalent modiﬁcations of DNA.1–3 These
covalent modiﬁcations of chromatin include DNA methylation
(at CpG sites), lysine acetylation/deacetylation, lysine and arginine
methylation/demethylation, lysine ubquitinylation/deubquitiny
lation, serine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and others;
each of these covalent modiﬁcations is catalyzed by speciﬁc
group-transfer enzymes.4,5 Alterations in the catalytic activity
of any of these enzymes can lead to pathogenic alterations in
the pattern of gene transcription within a particular cell type. For
example, alterations in the enzymatic activity of speciﬁc protein
methyltransferases (PMTs) can diminish the transcription of tumor
suppressor genes or enhance the transcription of oncogenes—
either mechanism leading to a hyperproliferative, tumorigenic
phenotype6,7 (vide infra).
Surveying the constituency of chromatin-modifying enzymes in
humans6 reveals that 450% of these enzymes are involved in
the reversible transfer of methyl groups on to and off of lysine or
arginine residues of histone proteins (Figure 1c). In particular,
the PMTs constitute a large class of enzymes composed of
two families:8 the protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) and
the protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs); a number of
examples of genetic alterations in PMTs have been identiﬁed in
speciﬁc human cancers, as will be discussed below. The reactions

catalyzed by PMTs have a paramount role in controlling gene
transcription, as they result in eight distinct chemical states of
lysine and arginine (0, 1, 2, or 3 methyl groups on lysine and 0, 1,
2-symmetric and 2-asymmetric on arginine; Figure 1d), each of
which can confer unique transcriptional, and hence phenotypic,
effects on cells.9
In this review we shall focus our attention on the aberrant
activity of PMTs that drive tumorigenesis in speciﬁc human
cancers and current efforts to identify potent and selective smallmolecule inhibitors of these enzymes as a basis for personalized
cancer therapeutics.

CATALYTIC MECHANISM OF PMTS
The PMTs catalyze the common chemical reaction of SN2 transfer
of a methyl group from the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the nitrogen atom(s) of a lysine or arginine
side chain7 and sometimes histidine or the amino terminus of the
polypeptide chain10 (Figure 2a). In all PMTs that have thus far been
studied, the reaction involves direct transfer of the methyl group
from SAM to the nitrogen acceptor; thus, both SAM and the
protein substrate must be simultaneously bound to the enzyme in
such a way as to achieve correct molecular orbital alignment
and proximity for methyl transfer.7 The reaction mechanism is
thus referred to as a ternary complex bi–bi mechanism, indicating
that the enzymes convert two substrates (SAM and the protein) to
two products (SAH (S-adenosylhomocysteine) and the methylated
peptide) through requisite formation of a ternary enzyme–SAM–
protein complex.11 The crystal structures of a large number of
PMTs have been solved, all showing a distinct SAM binding pocket
adjacent to a well-deﬁned lysine- or arginine-binding channel.12
The termini of the SAM and amino-acid binding sites intersect to
create favorable positioning of the two substrates for facile methyl
group transfer (Figure 2b). As will be discussed below, both the
SAM and amino-acid binding pockets provide structural loci for
potential inhibitor interactions.5,6 Thus, the structural features

Figure 1. (a) Covalent modifications of chromatin include methylation of the chromosomal DNA at CpG islands and posttranslational
modifications of histone proteins. Among these posttranslational histone modifications are methylation reactions at the side chains of
arginine and lysine residues that are catalyzed by the PMT enzyme families RMTs and KMTs, respectively. (b) Chromatin exists in two major
conformational states: a relaxed, transcriptionally permissive state known as euchromatin, and a condensed, transcriptionally repressive state
known as heterochromatin. The transition between these two conformational states is facilitated by the collection of posttranslational
modifications of histone proteins, which are summarized in panel (a) of this figure. (c) The constituency of chromatin-modifying enzymes in
humans. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of enzymes of each family that are found in humans. (d) Methylation states of

of PMTs required for catalysis make these enzymes attractive
targets for intervention by small, drug-like inhibitors.5,7,13,14
Despite the commonality of chemical mechanism catalyzed, the
PMTs display a remarkable degree of structural diversity within the
SAM and amino-acid binding pockets; the relatedness of the SAM
binding pockets of the human PMTs has been studied and
mapped onto a set of family trees for the PKMTs and the PRMTs
as illustrated in Figure 2c.8 This structural diversity portends
the ability to design selective inhibitors that engage unique
recognition elements within the natural ligand binding sites.
Additionally, the PMTs display a considerable degree of substrate
speciﬁcity with respect to the exact lysine or arginine residue that
is methylated. Protein substrate speciﬁcity is likely conferred by
recognition elements external to the SAM and amino-acid binding
pockets that engage complementary elements within the aminoacid sequence of the histone. Thus, one ﬁnds generally that a
limited number of PMT enzymes catalyze methylation at speciﬁc
histone sites.2 For example, the enzyme DOT1L is the only
human PMT known to catalyze methylation of histone H3 at lysine
79 (H3K79).15 Likewise, the multiprotein polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2), containing the catalytic subunit EZH2 or EZH1,
is the only known catalyst of H3K27 methylation.16 Substrate
speciﬁcity is somewhat more relaxed among the PRMTs, several of
which have been demonstrated to methylate both nuclear and
cytosolic protein substrates;17 nevertheless, within a particular
protein substrate, PRMTs tend to catalyze methyl addition to a
Oncogene (2013) 939 – 946

limited number (often only one) of speciﬁc amino-acid sites. This
stringency of substrate speciﬁcity provides a direct mechanism for
biochemical and biological ﬁdelity with respect to control of gene
transcription.
GENETIC ALTERATIONS OF PMTS IN CANCER
A number of PMTs have been shown to be genetically altered in
human cancers, and in several cases these alterations have been
demonstrated to be drivers of tumorigenesis.6,7 Among the types
of alterations seen within PMTs are overexpression, gene
ampliﬁcation, chromosomal translocations and point mutations.
In many, but not all cases, the genetic alteration leads to a gain- or
change-of-function in catalytic activity that can be directly
correlated with the tumorigenic phenotype of the disease. Three
examples of PKMTs will be discussed here that exemplify the
breadth of genetic alterations seen among PMTs in human
cancers: DOT1L, EZH2 and WHSC1.
DOT1L
DOT1L is unique among the PKMTs in that it does not contain the
otherwise universal catalytic domain of lysine methyltransferases
known as the SET domain.15 In fact, from a structural and
pharmacologic perspective, DOT1L is better associated with
the PRMTs, despite the demonstrated biochemical activity of
this enzyme as a lysine methyltransferase.8 The enzyme uniquely

catalyzes the mono-, di- and tri-methylation of H3K79. Methylated
H3K79 is associated with active gene transcription. DOT1L activity
has been demonstrated to be a required driver of proliferation in
mixed lineage leukemia 1 protein (MLL)-rearranged leukemia,
a devastating disease that affects patients of all ages.18,19
MLL-rearranged leukemia is universally associated with a
chromosomal translocation affecting the MLL gene at chromosomal location 11q23.20,21 The translocation results in a protein
fusion between the MLL protein (itself a SET-domain PKMT that
loses its SET domain as a result of the chromosomal translocation)
and any of a number of protein partners, mainly of the AF and ENL
families.20–22 The amino terminus contains domains that are
responsible for targeting the MLL protein to speciﬁc target genes
and these domains are retained within the context of the fusion
protein.23–25 MLL fusion proteins recruit several complexes
that increase the expression of their target genes and include
polymerase-associated factor complex, positive transcription
elongation factor and DOT1L.26–29 Polymerase-associated factor
complex is recruited via the amino terminus of MLL, which
remains intact in the MLL fusion protein. Polymerase-associated
factor complex has an important role in initiation, elongation and
termination of gene transcription. Positive transcription
elongation factor, consisting of cyclin T and cdk9, is recruited to
the complex via the fusion partners (ENL, ELL and AF4) and
phosphorylates the carboxy terminal domain of RNA polymerase
II. Interestingly, the wild-type MLL protein is also essential for
leukemogenesis in MLL-rearranged leukemia.30 The fusion partner
proteins also provide the binding domain that recruits DOT1L to
the MLL fusion.31 Thus, DOT1L is recruited to ectopic gene
locations, where it catalyzes the methylation of H3K79
and thereby induces aberrant transcription of a number
of leukemogenic genes, including HOXA9 and MEIS1.32 Studies
using either RNA silencing methods19 or selective small-molecule
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

inhibitors18 of DOT1L have demonstrated that the catalytic activity
of this enzyme is required for proliferation of MLL-rearranged
leukemic cells. Thus, the dependence of MLL-rearranged leukemia
on DOT1L activity results from an indirect mechanism of genetic
alteration. Although the enzyme itself is not altered in the disease,
the chromosomal translocation indirectly results in a unique
dependency of MLL-rearranged leukemic cells on DOT1L activity
for transformation.
In addition to having a role in MLL-rearranged leukemia, DOT1L
may also have a role in colon cancer. Mahmoudi et al.33 identiﬁed
AF10 and DOT1L as b-catenin-associated proteins in intestinal
crypts and showed that DOT1L is essential for Wnt-dependent
transcription.
WHSC1
WHSC1 (also referred to as MMSET or NSD2) is a SET-domain PKMT
that catalyzes the dimethylation of H3K36.34,35 Methylation of this
histone site is associated with regions that are transcriptionally
active. The t(4;14) chromosomal translocation occurs in a subset of
about 15% of multiple myeloma cases36,37 and patients with this
translocation represent one of the worst prognostic subgroups of
multiple myeloma.38 The t(4;14) translocation results in massive
overexpression of WHSC1 and of ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor
3 (FGFR3) due to the placement of the strong immunoglobulin H
intronic Em enhancer and 30 enhancer in the promoter regions
of WHSC1 and FGFR3 genes, respectively. Although ca 30% of
t(4;14) patients have lost expression of FGFR3, 100% retain
overexpression of WHSC1, suggesting that WHSC1, rather than
FGFR3, is the primary driver of the disease.38 The overexpression
of WHSC1 in t(4;14) translocated cells results in signiﬁcantly
elevated levels of dimethylated H3K36, as would be expected
from elevation of catalytic enzyme levels.39 Genetic knockdown of

WHSC1 or disruption of the translocated allele in t(4;14) myeloma
cells results in inhibition of cellular proliferation and of
tumorigenicity. As expected, genetic knockdown of WHSC1
demonstrates an accompanying reduction in global levels of
H3K36me2.39
EZH2
EZH2, or the closely related EZH1, is a SET-domain PKMT that
represents the catalytic subunit of a multiprotein complex referred
to as PRC2. At least four protein subunits are required for PKMT
activity (EZH2/1, EED, SUZ12 and RbAp48) and the active PRC2
complex demonstrates a high degree of speciﬁcity for methylation
of H3K27.16 PRC2 catalyzes three sequential methylation reactions
at H3K27, resulting in mono-, di- and tri-methylated H3K27. The
tri-methyl H3K27 mark has been shown to be associated with
transcriptional silencing; among the genes whose transcription is
silenced are several known tumor suppressors. Not surprisingly,
then, mechanisms that lead to a hyper-trimethylated state of
H3K27 have been found to be universally tumorigenic for a
number of hematologic and solid tumors.40
Several mechanisms have been reported to lead to a hypertrimethylated state of H3K27.40 These include overexpression of
EZH2, ampliﬁcation of EZH2 and/or other PRC2 subunits, and lossof-function mutations in the corresponding H3K27 demethylase,
UTX (also known as KDM6A). Recently, recurrent somatic
mutations at tyrosine 641 of EZH2 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S and
Y641H) have been reported in a subgroup of patients with nonHodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).41 These point mutations have been
demonstrated to also lead to a hyper-trimethylated state of H3K27
by a novel mechanism. The Y641 mutations were found to be
heterozygous in NHL patients where equal amounts of wild-type
and mutant enzyme were found (at both the mRNA and protein
level).41 The wild-type enzyme was found to be a very efﬁcient
catalyst of H3K27 mono-methylation, but to wane in activity for
the dimethylation and especially the trimethylation reaction.
In direct contrast, the Y641 mutant EZH2 proteins showed the
exact opposite substrate speciﬁcity; they were essentially inactive
as H3K27 mono-methyltransferases, but active in taking the
preformed H3K27me1 species to the H3K27me2 form and
especially efﬁcient at taking the H3K27me2 state to the
H3K27me3 form.42 Thus, hyper-trimethylation of H3K27 in the
mutant-bearing NHL cells is the result of requisite coupling of
enzymatic activity between the wild-type and mutant forms of the
enzyme. Hence, pathogenesis is only conferred in this situation
when the wild-type and mutant enzymes are present in the
context of heterozygosity. Another mutation of EZH2 has also
been found to occur heterozygously in a subset of NHL patients.
This more rare mutation occurs at alanine 677 (A677G).41 Recently
McCabe et al.43 have shown that this mutation results in
nearly equal efﬁciency for all three substrates and increased
trimethylation of H3K27.
Genetic alterations of EZH2 and other PRC2 proteins are not
limited to the Y641 and A677 mutations observed in lymphoma.
A spectrum of genetic alterations of PRC2 has been documented
in a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. Interestingly, in
myeloid malignancies and T-cell leukemia, mutations in PRC2
subunits lead to loss of enzymatic function.44–46 The fact that both
activating and inactivating mutations of EZH2 are associated with
malignancy is remarkable and indicates the complex role of PRC2
target genes in cell fate decisions.
A recent study by Mochizuki-Kashio et al.47 showed that EZH2
is essential for fetal hematopoiesis but is not required for
hematopoietic stem cells in adult bone marrow. Rather EZH1 is
highly expressed in hematopoietic stems cells from adult bone
marrow. Therefore, the development of compounds that
selectively inhibit EZH2 with more limited impact on EZH1 could
spare any potential effect on hematopoietic stem cells in the
bone marrow.

DIRECT INHIBITORS OF PMTS
The cumulative data suggesting that genetic alterations in PMTs
drive tumorigenesis in a number of human cancers has generated
considerable interest in the discovery and development
of selective inhibitors of these enzymes as potential therapeutic
agents for genetically-deﬁned cancers.6,7 For example, the
overarching objective of our own group is to identify driver
alterations of PMTs in human cancers that confer to the cancer cell
a unique dependence on the enzymatic activity of the altered PMT
for proliferation, and to then discover and develop selective
inhibitors against that PMT. In this manner, the selective inhibition
of the altered PMT can provide a basis for therapeutic intervention
with a reasonable therapeutic index, owing to the unique
dependence of the genetically-deﬁned cancer on PMT activity.
Early reports of small-molecule inhibitors of PMTs presented
either non-speciﬁc SAM analogs, such as SAH (the universal
product of SAM hydrolysis) and sinefungin (Figure 3), or indirect
inhibitors, such as 3-deazaneplanocin, which does not inhibit
PMTs per se, but rather inhibits the enzyme SAH hydrolase and
thereby increases cellular levels of SAH, resulting in non-selective
inhibition of PMT (and other SAM-utilizing enzymes) activity.48
Over the past 5 years a number of potent, selective inhibitors of
PMTs have been published; a representative sampling of these
inhibitors is illustrated in Figure 3, where we also provide the
reported afﬁnity of the compound for its primary target PMT. These
compounds generally bind their enzyme targets in one of two ways:
either by competing with SAM for its binding pocket, or by
competing with the methyl-accepting amino-acid binding pocket.
Compounds that are competitive with SAM include the
aminonucleoside analogs reported by Mori et al.,49 Yao et al.50
and Daigle et al.18 These compounds were designed as SAM/SAH
mimetics and display a range of target afﬁnity and selectivity. The
compound EPZ004777, for example, is a 300-pM, SAM-competitive
inhibitor of DOT1L that demonstrates41200-fold selectivity
for this enzyme over all other tested PMTs.18 The high afﬁnity of
EPZ004777 and related analogs derives from a conformational
adaptation mechanism in which the enzyme changes
conformation to close down the ligand binding pocket around
the inhibitor.51 This mechanism drives compound afﬁnity largely
by reducing the rate of dissociation for the enzyme-inhibitor
binary complex, thus resulting in very long drug-target residence
time.52,53
Consistent with the idea that the chromosomal translocation
confers a unique dependence on DOT1L enzymatic activity in
MLL-rearranged leukemia, EPZ004777 was found to selectively kill
MLL-rearranged leukemia cells in vitro, with little antiproliferative
effect on non-rearranged cells. EPZ004777 causes a decrease
in celluar histone H3K79 methylation followed by a decrease in
MLL fusion target gene expression and induction of apoptosis
in MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines. The induction of apoptosis
is preceded by accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell
cycle and gene expression changes consistent with hematopoietic
differentiation.18 Additionally, EPZ004777 is the ﬁrst PMT inhibitor
to demonstrate anticancer effects and survival beneﬁt in an
animal model of MLL-rearranged leukemia18 (vide infra).
Small-molecule inhibition of DOT1L has therapeutic potential
beyond oncology. Recently, Onder et al.54 found that inhibition of
DOT1L activity results in acceleration of induced pluripotent stem
cell generation. Importantly they demonstrate that DOT1L
inhibition causes a decrease in H3K79 methylation in genes that
are fated to be repressed in the pluripotent state.
The aminonucleoside inhibitors of DOT1L and SET7/9 bear a
clear structural resemblance to SAM and SAH. It is therefore not
surprising that these compounds act in a competitive manner
with respect to SAM. In contrast, other SAM-competitive inhibitors
of PMTs have been recently reported that do not retain
any chemical resemblance to the nucleoside substrate. The
indazole EPZ005687, for example, is a potent and selective

SAM-competitive inhibitor of EZH2-containing PRC2 that has been
shown to inhibit wild-type and NHL-associated mutant EZH2 with
nanomolar afﬁnity.55,56 Although this compound inhibits
both wild-type and mutant EZH2, one would expect the mutantbearing NHL cells would have a unique dependence on EZH2
activity for proliferation, such that compounds like EPZ005687
would demonstrate selective killing of these cells. Indeed,
EPZ005687 has been shown to selectively kill NHL cells that
are heterozygous for EZH2 mutations at either Y641 or A677G,
with limited impact on the growth of homozygous wild-type
EZH2-containing NHL cells.55 Compounds of similar structure,
potency and EZH2 selectivity have also been reported in a set
of patent applications from the group at GlaxoSmithKline57–60
(a representative example is shown in Figure 3).
A large number of PMT inhibitors act by binding not to the SAM
pocket but instead to the protein-substrate binding site and
engaging recognition elements within the amino-acid channel.
Examples of compounds with this binding modality have been
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

identiﬁed for both PKMT and PRMT targets. For example, the
compound BIX-01294 was among the ﬁrst PMT inhibitors to be
reported and is a potent and selective inhibitor of the SET-domain
PKMT EHMT2 (also known as G9a).61 Structural analogs of
this compound were subsequently designed as dual EHMT1 and
EHMT2 inhibitors with much greater target afﬁnity and cell
permeability. The compound UNC-0638, for example, was shown
to reduce levels of H3K9 methylation in MDA-MB231 cells with an
IC50 of 81 nM.62 Likewise, the compound AZ505 has been shown
crystallographically to bind to the SET-domain PKMT SMYD2
within the lysine binding channel.63 Similarly, the structurally
related compounds from the Methylgene and Bristol-Myers
Squibb groups are nanomolar inhibitors of the PRMT CARM1
(also known as PRMT4) that have been shown crystallographically
to bind within the arginine channel of this enzyme.64–66
A ﬁnal modality of enzyme interaction is exempliﬁed by the
PRMT1 inhibitor Compound 5, which is presumed to act as a
bisubstrate inhibitor, engaging recognition elements both within

Targeting genetic alterations in protein methyltransferases

944
the SAM and within the arginine binding pockets. This compound
is a relatively modest inhibitor of PRMT1, but demonstrates
cellular activity in reducing methylation in HepG2 cells.67 Hence,
this may be an interesting starting point for further compound
optimization.
IN VIVO ANTICANCER ACTIVITY OF PMT INHIBITORS
A critical step towards the eventual clinical use of PMT inhibitors is
the demonstration of antitumor effects in appropriate animal
models of cancer. In this regard, the ﬁeld of PMT inhibitors is still
quite early, with only one published report of in vivo activity for
any compound.
In 2011, Daigle et al.18 reported the ﬁrst clear evidence that
inhibition of a speciﬁc PMT could lead to selective cancer cell
killing and resultant in vivo efﬁcacy in an animal model of cancer.
These workers reported studies of EPZ004777, a potent (Ki 300 pM)
and selective (X1200-fold over other PMTs) DOT1L inhibitor. The
compound selectively blocked global H3K79 methylation in
leukemia cells regardless of whether or not the cells harbored
MLL gene translocations. However, despite the ability to affect
intracellular H3K79 methylation in all cell types, the compound
was selectively cytotoxic for leukemia cells containing the MLL
gene translocations, with minimal effects on non-translocated
cells. Daigle et al.18 went on to test the effects of EPZ004777 in a
highly aggressive, disseminated mouse model of mixed lineage
leukemia. The compound was administered by continuous
administration at three concentrations of 50, 100 and 150 mg/
ml for 14 days, and survival was monitored over the course of
30 days. At all doses administered, statistically signiﬁcant survival
advantages over the vehicle-dosed animals were achieved;
the extent of survival increased with increasing dose of the
compound. These data represent the ﬁrst in vivo evidence that
selective PMT inhibition can lead to antitumor efﬁcacy.
Jo et al.68 showed that DOT1L has a crucial role in hematopoiesis using a postnatal conditional knockout technique.
Importantly, overt toxicity in the hematopoietic compartment
was not detected for the ﬁrst 7–8 weeks after Dot1L excision. The
authors thus suggest that this potential toxicity may be managed
using noncontinuous dosing paradigms and transfusions. Whether
or not reversible inhibition of DOT1L by a small-molecule drug will
result in any hematopoietic liability remains to be determined.
Recently, the GlaxoSmithKline and Epizyme groups have
reported at scientiﬁc meetings that some of their selective EZH2
inhibitors have demonstrated antitumor effects in subcutaneous
xenograft mouse models. No peer-reviewed publications of this
work have yet appeared, but these preliminary verbal reports are
of signiﬁcant interest to this emerging ﬁeld of drug discovery and
development.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The interest in PMT inhibitors as potential cancer therapeutics has
grown considerable over the past 4  5 years, to the point that
today many academic groups and most pharmaceutical companies have efforts ongoing against this target class. On the basis of
recent presentations at scientiﬁc meetings it seems very likely that
selective PMT inhibitors will enter human clinical trials within the
next year or two. Speciﬁcally, inhibitors of DOT1L for MLLrearranged leukemia and EZH2 for mutant-bearing NHL appear to
be the most advanced programs among industrial groups that
have been presented publically. Thus, the near future is likely to
see the clinical testing of PMT inhibitors for human cancer
indications. This is an exciting development for the ﬁeld and the
demonstration of clinical response to these inhibitors will be a key
milestone to ensure continued enthusiasm for these novel
therapeutic targets. Although it is still early in the development
of PMT inhibitors for clinical application, a common concern of all
Oncogene (2013) 939 – 946

targeted cancer drugs is the emergence of drug resistance.
Resistance to therapy may arise through several potential
mechanisms, including direct effect on the targeted methyltransferase, activation of compensatory pathways (for example, by
increased expression of a redundant methyltransferase), altered
metabolism or efﬂux of the inhibitor. Whether or not such
resistance mechanisms will constitute a major impediment to the
clinical use of PMT inhibitors remains to be determined.
The development of potent, selective inhibitors of DOT1L and
EZH2 reﬂect merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg for PMT
targets that are genetically altered in human cancers. Beyond
DOT1L, EZH2 and WHSC1, surveys of public cancer genome
databases and published literature suggest that many other PMTs
are genetically altered in human cancers through translocation,
gene ampliﬁcation and mutation. Likewise, there have been
several reports of loss-of-function mutations or deletions in
protein demethylases in cancers that may, in an indirect manner,
confer sensitivity to inhibition of the corresponding PMT for
speciﬁc amino-acid methylation/demethylation events. For example, loss-of-function mutations in the H3K27 demethylase UTX,
with an accompanying hyper-trimethylation of H3K27, have been
reported for subsets of myeloma, esophageal and renal cancers69
and medulloblastoma.70,71 Hence, inhibition of PRC2-catalyzed
methylation of the H3K27 site may be of value for these
indications. Additionally, the H3K4 demethylase KDM1A has
recently been shown to have an essential role in maintaining
MLL fusion protein target gene expression in MLL-rearranged
leukemia.72 Inhibition of this demethylase with small-molecule
inhibitors induced cell death. Whether all of these alterations of
epigenetic enzymes will prove to be tumorigenic drivers remains
to be determined. Nevertheless, even if only a subset of these
enzymatic activities are required for the tumorigenic phenotype,
the PMTs would still constitute a large pool of targets for drug
discovery.
The concept of personalized cancer therapeutics rests on the
ability to (1) deﬁne unique driver alterations in a speciﬁc cancer,
(2) discover and develop potent and selective drugs against that
uniquely altered target and (3) simultaneously develop screening
modalities with which to identify patients harboring the alteration,
who are most likely to beneﬁt from treatment with the targeted
drug (that is, companion diagnostics). Recent examples of the
success of this approach with selective kinase inhibitors portend a
greater future reliance on personalized cancer therapeutics for
clinical oncology and perhaps in other areas of medicine as well.
As described in this brief review, the PMTs seem ideally suited as
targets for personalized cancer therapeutics, both because of
the demonstrated reliance of speciﬁc cancers on the enzymatic
activity of these enzymes and because of the general susceptibility
of this target class to inhibition by small, drug-like compounds.
Further development of selective inhibitors against these enzymes
thus offers considerable potential for augmenting the current
armamentarium of personalized cancer therapies.
