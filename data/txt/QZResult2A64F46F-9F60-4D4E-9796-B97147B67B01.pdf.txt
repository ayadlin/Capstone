BACKGROUND. The combination of a fixed dose rate (FDR) infusion of gemcitabine and irinotecan may have a synergistic effect in the treatment of patients
with advanced and metastatic pancreatic and biliary cancer. The current study
was conducted to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination.

METHODS. There were 32 patients with metastatic pancreatic and advanced unreAbramson Cancer Center of the University of

sectable/metastatic biliary adenocarcinoma who were entered into this openlabel, phase 1 dose escalation trial. Gemcitabine was administered at an FDR of
10 mg/m2/minute intravenously (iv). Irinotecan was administered iv over 60 minutes after gemcitabine. Both gemcitabine and irinotecan were given on Days 1
and 8 of a 21-day cycle.

RESULTS. The MTD of the combination was gemcitabine at an FDR of 1200 mg/
m2 and irinotecan at a dose of 100 mg/m2. The DLTs were neutropenia and neutropenic fever. Other DLTs included diarrhea, dehydration, and fatigue. Two
patients developed deep venous thrombosis during the treatment. The efficacy of
the combination was encouraging, even at the lower dose levels. Of 30 assessable
patients, there was 1 complete response, 6 partial responses, and 16 patients
with stable disease, with a response rate of 23%, a disease control rate of 76%, a
median progression-free survival of 4.7 months, and a median overall survival of
7.0 months. The average number of treatment cycles received was 11.
CONCLUSIONS. The recommended doses of the combination for future study are
gemcitabine at an FDR of 1200mg/m2 and irinotecan at a dose of 100 mg/m2.
The efficacy of the combination is encouraging. Further assessment of the combination with or without biologic agents is suggested. Cancer 2007;110:2768–74.

ancreatic and biliary cancer continues to be a major unresolved
health problem and a therapeutic challenge. Pancreatic cancer
is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in men and the
fifth most common cause of cancer death in women in the U.S. In
2006, it was estimated that 33,730 new cases of pancreatic cancer
would be diagnosed in the U.S. and 32,300 deaths would occur due
to the disease.1 Only 1% to 4% of patients diagnosed with this neoplasm survive 5 years after diagnosis.
The incidence of biliary cancer or cholangiocarcinoma is not as
easily discernable but it was estimated that there would be approximately 8570 new cases of gallbladder and extrahepatic biliary cancer
plus an extra number of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cases

diagnosed in the U.S. in 2006.1 The incidence has
been rising over the past 20 years for reasons that
our knowledge are still unclear but may be attributable to better methods of diagnosis or an increase in
certain risk factors. The prognosis for patients with
unresectable biliary cancer is very poor. To our
knowledge, there is no standard chemotherapy regimen for biliary cancer, although some chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated some activity for
this disease.2,3
Although gemcitabine (20 20 -difluorodeoxycytidine
[dFdC]) has been the standard chemotherapy agent
for patients with advanced/metastatic pancreatic
cancer since it was approved by U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 1997,4 the efficacy of the
treatment is considered moderate. Fixed dose rate
(FDR) administration of gemcitabine may increase
objective responses and the median survival and 1year survival by increasing intracellular levels of
active diphosphates and triphosphates.5 Meanwhile,
combinations of gemcitabine with different cytotoxic
agents have been tested.6–12 However, to our knowledge the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and doselimiting toxicity (DLT) of the FDR infusion of gemcitabine either as a single agent or as a combination
with other chemotherapy agents have not been well
studied to date.13
Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, has
broad antitumor activity as either a single agent or
combination with other chemotherapy agents.14
Synergistic effects have been shown with the combination of gemcitabine and irinotecan preclinically.
Isobologram analysis revealed that the combination
of gemcitabine and irinotecan exerted synergy over a
wide range of concentrations in MCF-7 breast cancer
and SCOG small cell lung cancer cell lines.15
Although study of the combination of a standard 30minute infusion of gemcitabine and irinotecan did
not demonstrate any advantage in time to disease
progression (3.5 months vs 3.0 months; P 5 .352),
median survival (6.3 months vs 6.6 months;
P 5 .789), and 1-year survival rates compared with
gemcitabine alone in the treatment of patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer, the combination therapy was associated with a higher objective response
rate (16% vs 4.4%; P 5 .001 by the chi-square test).8
It is hypothesized that the use of FDR gemcitabine in
combination with irinotecan may be more efficacious than the standard infusion of gemcitabine plus
irinotecan.
The primary goal of this phase 1 study was to
assess the MTD and DLT of the combination of FDR
gemcitabine and irinotecan in patients with
advanced pancreatic and biliary cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients with histologically confirmed and clinically
metastatic pancreatic or advanced unresectable/metastatic biliary adenocarcinoma were eligible for the
current study. The response to the combination was
assessed for patients with measurable disease.
Patients had to be age >18 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2, and adequate organ function (defined
as a white blood cell count 3000/mm3, an absolute
neutrophil count [ANC] 1500/mm3, a platelet count
100,000/mm3, serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL, total
bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL, and aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 2.5 times the upper
limit of normal [ULN] or 5.0 times the ULN in the
presence of hepatic metastases). There was no
restriction in the number of prior chemotherapy regimens received. Patients who previously had received
either gemcitabine as a standard infusion or irinotecan were eligible to be enrolled on the study; however, patients who were previously treated with both
drugs would not qualify for the trial. Patients must
not have received any chemotherapy or radiotherapy
for 4 weeks before entering the study, and must have
been fully recovered from the acute effects of any
prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients with
brain metastases, active infection, or other serious
comorbid disease were excluded from this study.
Pregnant or lactating women also were excluded.
Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients. This study was approved by the institutional
review board of the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania.
Study Design
This study was an open-label, single-center, nonrandomized, dose-escalating phase 1 trial to evaluate
the safety of a combination of FDR infusion gemcitabine and irinotecan for the treatment of metastatic
pancreatic and advanced unresectable/metastatic biliary cancer. The primary endpoints were to determine the dose for a phase 2 study, the DLTs, and the
MTD. The secondary endpoints were the response
rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival in
those patients with measurable or evaluable disease.
Gemcitabine was administered at an FDR of 10
mg/m2/minute intravenously (iv) and therefore the
infusion time varied based on the dose level. Irinotecan was administered iv over 60 minutes after gemcitabine. Both gemcitabine and irinotecan were given
on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. The treatment
cycles were repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.

The dose escalation schedule of the current
study is listed in Table 1. To obtain safety data accurately, the second and third patients were not enrolled until 3 weeks after the first patient was
enrolled in that cohort level. The first patient for the
following cohort level was not enrolled until 3 weeks
after the last patient from the previous cohort level
entered the study.
DLTs were determined during the first and second treatment cycles. DLT was defined, using the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria
(NCI-CTC; version 2.0), as 1 of the following effects
attributable to the study drug and requiring discontinuation or a significant dose reduction in the study
drug(s): 1) an ANC <500/mm3 lasting for >5 days; 2)
an ANC <1000/mm3 with a fever >38.58C; 3) a platelet count <25,000/mm3; 4) grade 3 diarrhea despite
maximal loperamide support; and 5) nonhematologic
toxicity of grade 3.
The MTD was defined as 1 dose level below the
dose that induced a DLT in >33% of the patients in a
given cohort. The occurrence of 1 episode of DLT in
the initial 3 patients required the accrual of 3 additional patients to that level. If no more episodes of
DLT were identified, dose escalation proceeded. If 2
of 6 DLT episodes were identified, the given dose
level was considered too toxic. There was no dose
escalation within individual patients.

Pretreatment and Follow-up Studies
Physical examination, complete blood count (CBC)
with differential, electrolyte levels with creatinine,
and liver function tests were measured before study
entry on Days 1, 8, and 15 during the first 2 cycles. If
neutropenia was note, CBC with differential was then
repeated every other day to assess the DLT. Physical
examination and all tests were performed as scheduled in the following cycles. Carbohydrate antigen
19-9 (CA 19-9) was assessed before each cycle of
therapy. Patients with measurable or evaluable dis-

ease were assessed using computed tomography (CT)
scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after every second treatment cycle to obtain response data.
The indicator tumor could be a primary or metastatic
lesion found on diagnostic imaging and tumor
response was evaluated using the RECIST (Response
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) criteria.

RESULTS
Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study
between March 2002 and May 2005 (Table 2). All 32
patients were evaluable for toxicity and 30 patients
were evaluable for response. One patient enrolled
before the final pathology report was confirmed. The
final pathology report revealed that the patient had a
soft tissue sarcoma and the patient was withdrawn
from the study after just 1 dose of chemotherapy
(gemcitabine and irinotecan). The other patient enrolled received 1 cycle of chemotherapy and then
withdrew from the study. Thirty patients received at
least 1 cycle of treatment and up to 34 cycles of
treatment. There were 21 patients with metastatic
pancreatic cancer and 9 patients with biliary cancer.

DLT and Recommended Dose
There was no DLT observed at the first dose level. At
the second dose level, 1 patient developed DLTs
(grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 thrombocytopenia). The remaining 6 patients at the second dose
level did not develop a DLT. One patient developed a
DLT (grade 4 neutropenia) at the third dose level.
Another 7 patients enrolled to the level, and there
were no more DLTs reported. (Based on the request
of the University safety monitoring committee, more
that 6 patients were enrolled to the second and third
dose levels for safety analysis.) There were no DLTs

noted at the fourth and fifth dose levels. At the sixth
dose level, 2 DLTs were observed. One patient developed grade 4 neutropenia. A second patient developed a grade 3 infection with fever and grade 3
neutropenia during the first cycle that required dose
interruption. The patient was admitted to the hospital for drainage of a perihepatic abscess. Because 2
of the 5 patients at the sixth dose level experienced a
DLT, no more patients were enrolled at the sixth
dose level and additional patients were enrolled at
the next lower dose level (the fifth dose level). Of the
6 patients in total enrolled at this dose level, none
experienced a DLT. Therefore, the fifth dose level
(gemcitabine at a dose of 1200mg/m2 and irinotecan
at a dose of 100 mg/m2) was determined to be the
MTD and the recommended dose for further studies.

Overall Toxicity
All 32 patients were assessable for toxicity. Hematologic toxicities were observed in all levels of the
study (Table 3). Overall, there were 12 patients who

developed grade 3/4 neutropenia (38%), 8 patients
had grade 3 thrombocytopenia (25%), and 6 patients
had grade 3/4 anemia (18.8%).
Nausea and vomiting (grade 2 in 7 patients
[21.8%] and grade 3 in 1 patient [3%]) and diarrhea
and dehydration (grade 2 in 4 patients [12.5%] and
grade 3 in 4 patients [12.5%])) were the main nonhematologic toxicities noted (Table 4). There were
cases of grade 2 nausea and vomiting noted at all
levels of the study. Grade 3 diarrhea and/or dehydration were observed in the second, third, fourth,
and sixth dose levels. Fatigue was also common
among the treated patients. There were 2 cases of
deep vein thrombosis reported, and grade 2 hyperglycemia was reported in 2 patients at the second
and third dose levels, respectively. There was 1 case
of grade 3 hyperglycemia noted at the fourth dose
level. One patient had grade 3 abnormal liver function, which was considered secondary to his disease-related biliary obstruction and infection. Other
observed nonhematologic toxicities include alope-

Efficacy
The median number of cycles delivered to all enrolled patients was 6 (range, 1–34 cycles) and the average number of treatment cycles received was 11.
Although assessment of tumor response was not
a primary objective of the current study, patients
were evaluated for tumor response every 2 cycles
(6 weeks) during the treatment. Thirty of the 32
patients enrolled in the study were assessable for
response during this treatment. The objective tumor
responses were reported at different dose levels (Table 5). The overall response rate was 23% (1 complete response [CR] and 6 partial responses [PRs])
and the stable disease rate was 53%, which makes
the disease control rate (response rate  the standard deviation) 76%. The median progression-free survival was 4.7 months (Fig. 1). The median survival
time was 7.0 months (range, 1.6–32.4 months) (Fig. 2).
The 1-year survival rate was 23% (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 10.3–39.4%) and the 2-year survival
rate was 10% (95% CI, 2.6–23.6%) in this patient
population with advanced pancreatic and biliary cancer, with >67% of the patients having received previous treatment in the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
There were no obvious differences in efficacy noted
among patients with pancreatic cancer (1 CR and 4
PRs in 21 evaluable patients) or biliary cancer (2 PRs
in 9 patients).

DISCUSSION
Advanced pancreatic cancer and biliary cancer are
among the most challenging neoplasms because of
the combination of aggressiveness and biological
chemoresistance. A 30-minute iv bolus of gemcitabine was established as the standard treatment for

months.

FIGURE 2. Kaplan-Meier survival estimate of overall survival (N 5 30).
The median overall survival (MOS) was 7.0 months. The 1-year survival rate
was 23.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 10.339.4%) and the 2-year
survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2.623.6%).

patients with previously untreated, advanced, unresectable, and metastatic pancreatic cancer based on
the moderate benefits observed when compared with
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (response rate of 5.4% vs 0%;
clinical benefit response, which consisted of pain
assessment, functional status, and weight loss, 23.8% vs
4.8%; median survival of 5.7 months vs 4.4 months;
and a 1-year survival rate of 18% vs 2% [P 5 .0025]).4
The efficacy of gemcitabine is increased when it is
given as a FDR compared with as a 30-minute iv
bolus, but with increased toxicity.5 The initial study
compared an infusion of 1500 mg/m2 of gemcitabine
given over 150 minutes with a bolus dose of 2200
mg/m2 of gemcitabine given over 30 minutes.
Increased efficacy of the FDR infusion of gemcitabine was suggested (overall survival of 7.3 months vs

FDR Gemcitabine and Irinotecan/Sun et al.

4.9 months), with increased grade 3/4 toxicities (neutropenia, 48.8 % vs 26.5%; thrombocytopenia, 37.3% vs
10.2%; and anemia, 23.3% vs 18.4%).5 Although the
FDR gemcitabine infusion has been adopted and
applied to different phase 2 and 3 studies as either a
single agent or in combination,6–12 to our knowledge
there have been no available data regarding the DLT
and MTD of a FDR gemcitabine infusion. It is interesting to note that the combination of FDR gemcitabine with oxaliplatin did not demonstrate an obvious
survival benefit in a phase 3 randomized study.12 In
addition, no statistically significant improvement in
overall survival of single-agent FDR gemcitabine
compared with standard infusion was demonstrated
in that phase 3 study. To our knowledge, the current
study is the first analysis to demonstrate the DLTs
and MTD of the regimen of FDR gemcitabine in
combination with irinotecan given weekly for 2
weeks every 21 days. The recommended dose for this
regimen is 1200 mg/m2 of gemcitabine given over
120 minutes and irinotecan at a dose of 100 mg/m2.
The overall toxicity was considered to be tolerable,
with 40% of patients having grade 3/4 neutropenia,
25% having grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and 18.7%
having grade 3/4 anemia.
Although the efficacy analysis is the not the primary endpoint of this disease-oriented, phase 1
study, the results of the combination are encouraging, particularly in the current study population of
patients with very advanced disease, approximately
67% of whom received previous chemotherapy or
chemoradiation therapy. The study achieved a
response rate of 23% a stable disease rate of 53%, a
progression-free survival of 4.7 months, a median
overall survival of 7.0 months, and 1-year and 2-year
survival rates of 23% and 10%, respectively. The
response rate and survival data for this combination
at different dose levels are consistent with all gemcitabine combination studies with different cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic and biologic agents including cisplatin, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, docetaxel, fluoropyrimidines (5-FU or capecitabine), erlotinib, and
bevacizumab.6–12,16,17 It is not clear why the
increased response rate noted with the combination
of bolus gemcitabine and irinotecan versus gemcitabine alone (16.1% vs 4.4%) did not translate into a
survival benefit (overall survival of 6.3 months vs 6.6
months) in a phase 3 study.8 A similar result was
demonstrated in another multicenter phase 3 study
of bolus gemcitabine and irinotecan comparing
bolus gemcitabine monotherapy.18 However, the
higher rate of disease stabilization (53%) with a 76%
overall disease control rate observed with the combination of FDR gemcitabine infusion and irinotecan

2773

compared with bolus gemcitabine with irinotecan19
may improve the antitumor efficacy of the combination with pharmacodynamic advantages.20 The combination of FDR gemcitabine and irinotecan may
hold promise in the treatment of patients with
advanced metastatic biliary cancer.
The current era of molecularly targeted therapy
offers an opportunity to develop new treatments to
improve the outcome of patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic and biliary cancer. Overexpression
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been
found in both pancreatic and biliary cancer, and elevated EGFR and its ligand may be associated with a
worse outcome.21,22 The therapeutic benefit of EGFR
blockade has been demonstrated in patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer with the combination of
erlotinib, an ERFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and
gemcitabine.16 The clinical benefit of erlotinib also
has been suggested in patients with advanced biliary
cancer.23 Given the encouraging clinical benefits and
tolerable toxicities noted with the combination of
FDR gemcitabine and irinotecan and evidence of the
efficacy of blockade EGFR, the combination of an
EGFR inhibitor, either monoclonal antibody (cetuximab or pamatumumab) or tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(erlotinib), with FDR gemcitabine and irinotecan
deserves to be explored further.
