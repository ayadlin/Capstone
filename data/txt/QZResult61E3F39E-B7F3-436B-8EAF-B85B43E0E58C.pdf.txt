Abstract
Tumor cells require increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to support anabolism and
proliferation. The precise mechanisms regulating this process in tumor cells are unknown. Here,
we show that the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and one of its primary
ligands, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), are required for optimal mitochondrial function
within tumors. We found that RAGE is present in the mitochondria of cultured tumor cells as well
as primary tumors. RAGE and HMGB1 coordinately enhanced tumor cell mitochondrial complex
I activity, ATP production, tumor cell proliferation and migration. Lack of RAGE or inhibition of
HMGB1 release diminished ATP production and slowed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. These
findings link, for the first time, the HMGB1–RAGE pathway with changes in bioenergetics.
Moreover, our observations provide a novel mechanism within the tumor microenvironment by
which necrosis and inflammation promote tumor progression.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer can be defined by several critical alterations in normal cellular physiology, including
uncontrolled growth, immortality, evasion of apoptosis and ability to invade other tissues.1
More recently, it has become clear that two additional hallmarks should be included in the
setting of adult neoplasms— inflammation arising from necrosis and altered cellular
metabolism.2,3 Here, we demonstrate a link between cancer necrosis, resultant inflammatory
signals within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment and altered cellular metabolism.
High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts
(RAGE) are critical for enhanced tumor cell mitochondrial production of adenosine

HMGB1, a chromatin-associated nuclear protein and extracellular damage-associated
molecular-pattern molecule, is overexpressed in tumor cells and triggers inflammation, cell
migration and tumor metastasis following release into the extracellular space.4,5 We have
previously demonstrated that HMGB1, through one of its primary receptors, RAGE,
promotes tumor cell survival following genomic or metabolic stress.6,7 HMGB1 knockout
mice demonstrate profound disturbances in metabolism, succumbing during the neonatal
period to refractory hypoglycemia.8 The pancreas is an organ regulating host metabolism,
harboring pancreatic exocrine cells producing digestive enzymes, ductal cells involved with
their transport, and the endocrine cells that produce predominantly insulin and glucagon.
Our recent findings demonstrated that RAGE modulates crosstalk between pro-survival
pathways, IL6-pSTAT3 and autophagy, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor cells,
and contributes to early pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia formation.9 Here, we
hypothesized that signaling through the HMGB1/RAGE pathway would enhance pancreatic
ductal tumor cell survival and protect them from cytotoxic insult through linkage to altered
cellular metabolism.

Exogenous HMGB1 promotes increased ATP production in human and murine pancreatic
tumor cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We stimulated several pancreatic tumor cell lines with highly purified low endotoxin
HMGB1 (endotoxin ≤3.1 EU/ml). HMGB1 promoted ATP production and proliferation in
human and murine pancreatic tumor cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure
1a). This observation was not limited to pancreatic tumor cell lines, as HMGB1 also
promoted ATP production in human colon cancer (HCT116), leukemia (HL-60, Jurkat) and
lung cancer cells (A549) (Supplementary Figure S1). The histone deacetylase inhibitor,
trichostatin A, completely inhibited HMGB1-induced cell proliferation, but not ATP
production (Figure 1b). These findings suggest that HMGB1-induced ATP production is not
solely dependent on cellular proliferation. Release of HMGB1 by lysed ‘necrotic,’ but not
‘apoptotic’ cells triggers inflammation.10 As expected, HMGB1 wild-type ‘necrotic’ murine
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) triggered production of ATP, whereas wild-type apoptotic
MEFs were much less effective (Figure 1c). Significantly, HMGB1−/− MEFs (Figure 1c)
and necrotic MEFs in which HMGB1 activity was inhibited with a neutralizing antibody
(Figure 1d, left panel) were also unable to enhance ATP generation. Extracellular HMGB1
forms complexes with pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules such as
lipopolysaccharide and cytokines such as interleukin-1β+ (IL-1β), thereby promoting
inflammation.11 HMGB1-induced ATP production is not dependent on binding to DNA,
IL-1 β or interferon (IFN)-γ (Figure 1d, right panel), based on neutralization studies. To
determine whether ATP production is required for other aspects of HMGB1 function, we
treated cells with a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, rotenone (Rote). Rote (500 nM–2 µM)
treatment dose dependently limited ATP production (Figure 1e) induced by exogenous
HMGB1. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a central mediator of inflammation,12 cell
migration13 and tumor cell growth. We observed that Rote also inhibited HMGB1-mediated
NF-κB activity, cell migration and division (Figure 1e). shRNA knockdown of the p65
subunit of NF-κB, however, inhibited HMGB1-induced cell proliferation, but not ATP
production in pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 1f), suggesting that NF-κB is not required for
HMGB1-mediated ATP production. In addition, in preliminary observations we also
observed that fresh human pancreatic tumor biopsies demonstrate increased HMGB1, ATP

Exogenous HMGB1 increases tumor cell ATP production through RAGE
To determine which HMGB1 receptor is responsible for mediating enhanced ATP
production, we used specific shRNA and antibodies directed against known HMGB1
receptors. Targeted interference with signaling through RAGE, but not TLR-2, −4 nor
CD24, suppressed HMGB1-induced ATP production (Figure 2a). Complex I is the first step
in the mitochondrial ATP synthetic pathway. Targeting RAGE suppressed complex I
activity but not the abundance of the complex I subunits NDUFA9 and GRIM-19 (Figure
2b). RAGE shRNA and neutralizing antibodies decreased HMGB1-induced ATP production
and complex I activity in individual tumor cell lines (Figures 2a and b).

The cytosolic tail of RAGE (‘cyt-RAGE’) is essential for RAGE-dependent signal
transduction.14,15 We found that overexpression of the short cyt-RAGE increased basal and
HMGB1-induced ATP production in RAGE knockdown Panc02 cells (Figure 2c).
Indomethacin, an inhibitor of caveolin-mediated endocytic HMGB1 uptake,16 significantly
reversed HMGB1-mediated ATP production and cell proliferation when cyt-RAGE is
overexpressed in RAGE knockdown cells (Figure 2c). Structure–function studies have
demonstrated that the cytosolic tail is essential for RAGE-mediated intracellular signal
activation such as NF-κB, MEK–ERK–MAPK or mTOR.17,18 To explore whether these
signals are also required for cyt-RAGE-mediated ATP production in Panc02 cells, we
treated these cells with a microtubule-associated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor (for
example, U0126), an NF-κB inhibitor (for example, Bay 11-7085) or an mTOR inhibitor
(for example, Rapamycin). Only U0126 inhibited cyt-RAGE-mediated ATP production in
RAGE knockdown cells (Figure 2c). Moreover, U0126 inhibited HMGB1-mediated ATP
production when cyt-RAGE and full-RAGE is overexpressed in RAGE wild-type Panc02
cells (Figure 2d). These studies suggest that the MEK–ERK–MAPK pathway is involved in
RAGE-mediated ATP production.
RAGE is expressed in mitochondria

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RAGE is overexpressed in many different types of cancer, including pancreatic tumors.7,18
We determined the level of RAGE in several pancreatic tumor cell lines (Panc02, Panc2.03
and Panc3.27), as well as normal pancreatic tissues of mice and humans. RAGE was
detected in both the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions (Figure 3a) of cells.
Colocalization of mitochondria and RAGE is observed in Panc02 tumor cells as well as in
mouse pancreas, lung, heart and liver cells (Supplementary Figure S3). In addition, RAGE
co-localizes with mitochondria in human pancreatic tumor tissues as determined by confocal
microscopy (Supplementary Figure S4). To distinguish mitochondrial RAGE (mitRAGE)
from that arising from contamination with the cytoplasm, we precipitated proteins of
purified mitochondria and cytosol in parallel with RAGE, tubulin and mitochondrial HSP70
(mitHSP70). The ratio of RAGE to tubulin in the cytoplasm does not correlate with
increasing amounts of purified mitochondria (Figure 3b), but rather mitRAGE to mitHSP70
ratio increases in a dose-dependent fashion, suggesting that presence of RAGE detected
within the mitochondria is not due to cytosolic contamination. To determine whether
mitRAGE is located in the outer membrane of the mitochondrion, we incubated pancreatic
tumor cell mitochondria with proteinase K in the presence or absence of triton X-100.19
RAGE, retinoid-IFN-induced mortality-19 (GRIM-19, an inner membrane protein), and
mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase IV (an inner membrane protein) are resistant to
proteinase K, whereas Bcl-2 (an outer membrane protein) is degraded (Figure 3c). As a
positive control, when proteinase K is added to mitochondria in the presence of triton
X-100, all of the proteins are degraded. Thus, RAGE is likely located in the intermembrane

RAGE localizes to complex I of the mitochondria
To understand how RAGE positively regulates ATP production, we assessed RAGE within
immunoprecipitates of mitochondrial extracts prepared from pancreatic tumor cells with the
use of capture reagents for individual components of complex I, II, III or IV of the
mitochondrial electron transport chain (Figure 3d). To ensure antibody specificity, the blots
were also probed for known components of complex I (NDUFA9), complex II (Fb subunit),
complex III (core protein 2) and complex IV (subunit 1). Immunoprecipitates of complex I
and II contain RAGE, whereas immunoreactive RAGE is not detected in
immunoprecipitates using the IgG, complex III or IV antibody (Figure 3d). Notably,
HMGB1 enhanced the expression of mitRAGE in immunoprecipitates of complex I and II,
but not III and IV.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The mitochondrial electron transport chain in the mitochondrion is the site of oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) within eukaryotic cells. Post-glycolytic reactions also take
place within the mitochondria in eukaryotes, using imported pyruvate to generate acetylCoA for further biogenesis. To elucidate how RAGE regulates mitochondrial bioenergetics,
we assessed real-time OXPHOS by determining the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and
glycolysis by measuring the extracellular acidification rate (ECR) using an extracellular flux
analyzer20 in RAGE wild-type and RAGE knockdown Panc02 cells (Figure 3e). Analysis of
OCR and ECR was performed in the presence of four individual inhibitors: (1) oligomycin,
which inhibits mitochondrial ATP synthesis, (2) p-trifluoromethoxy carbonyl cyanide
phenyl hydrazone, which uncouples OXPHOS, revealing reserve capacity within the
mitochondria, (3) 2-deoxyglucose, which inhibits hexokinase in the glycolytic pathway and
(4) Rote, which inhibits complex I in the respiratory chain. Addition of HMGB1 to wildtype Panc02 tumor cells induced an increase in both OCR and ECR. Knockdown of RAGE
in these tumor cells led to a decrease in basal OCR and ECR that was not improved by the
addition of HMGB1. Together, these findings support the notion that RAGE has a critical
role in maintaining tumor cell bioenergetics.
Exogenous HMGB1 promotes mitochondrial localization of RAGE that is associated with
phosphorylation of RAGE and interaction with p-ERK1/2

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next examined the effect of exogenous HMGB1 on RAGE expression in the
mitochondria. We first observed that human pancreatic tumors demonstrated a two-fold
increase in overall RAGE expression and a 5.8-fold increase in mitRAGE (Figure 3f) when
compared to the adjacent control pancreatic tissue. We hypothesized that HMGB1 was
responsible for the increased RAGE observed in mitochondria in tumor tissue. To test this,
we treated human pancreatic tumor cell lines with HMGB1. We observed a dose- and timedependent increase in mitRAGE (Figure 3g and Supplementary Figure S5). Similarly,
HMGB1 within necrotic cell lysates increased the pancreatic tumor cell expression of
RAGE, NF-κB activity and cell migration (Supplementary Figure S6).
Regulation of mitochondrial proteins, including complex I, by phosphorylation is commonly
identified in the maintenance of mitochondrial processes, including OXPHOS.21 To
determine whether RAGE is a phosphoprotein, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with
antiRAGE antibody and analyzed with an antiphosphoserine antibody. The amount of
phosphorylated RAGE (p-RAGE) and complex I (p-CxI) increased following HMGB1
treatment (Figure 4a). HMGB1 triggers extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2) and activation in several cell types22,23 (Figure 4a). To
determine whether HMGB1 activates the ERK1/2 pathway, we treated pancreatic tumor

cells with the ERK inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059) or knocked-down MEK2, which
functions as an immediate upstream activating kinase of ERK, using specific siRNA.
Notably, ERK inhibitors (Figure 4a) and MEK2 siRNA (Figure 4b) inhibited HMGB1induced p-RAGE and p-CxI, as well as mitRAGE and ATP production. RAGE is indeed a
positive regulator of the ERK pathway.17,18 Similarly, RAGE knockdown in pancreatic
tumor cells blocked damageassociated molecular pattern molecules (such as HMGB1),
pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (such as lipopolysaccharide, for example,
cytokines such as tTNF-α) and chemotherapy (for example, oxaliplatin and melphalan)induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Figure 4c). Thus, ERK promotes RAGE
phosphorylation following HMGB1 stimulation, and RAGE is required for generation of pERK1/2 following stress. This suggests that there may be a direct interaction between
RAGE and p-ERK1/ 2, which mediates and promotes feed forward/coupled phosphorylation
activity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To confirm that there is a direct interaction between RAGE and p-ERK1/2 in cells,
immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting analysis were carried out using antiRAGE and anti-p-ERK1/2 antibodies. A p-ERK–RAGE complex is found in cells following
HMGB1 stimulation by co-immunoprecipitation assay (Figure 4d). The ERK inhibitor
U0126 also blocked p-ERK1/2 binding to RAGE (Figure 4d). The cyt-RAGE, but not
extracellular (ex-RAGE) or transmembrane-spanning domain (m-RAGE), is required for
binding p-ERK1/2 following HMGB1 stimulation (Figure 4e). p-RAGE translocated from
the cytoplasm to the mitochondria following HMGB1 treatment (Figure 4f). To determine
whether RAGE phosphorylation and accumulation within the mitochondria required new
protein synthesis, we treated cells with the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
(Figure 4g). Cycloheximide inhibited HMGB1-induced RAGE phosphorylation and
accumulation within the mitochondria. Moreover, we demonstrated that HMGB1 induced
translocation to the mitochondria of full-length RAGE, but not transmembrane RAGE (exmRAGE) (Figure 4h). These findings suggest that RAGE phosphorylation and accumulation
within the mitochondria requires new protein synthesis, but not translocation of the plasma
membrane portion of RAGE to the mitochondria.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of mouse RAGE has two potential phosphorylation
sites: Ser377 and Ser399. We assessed these residues as phosphorylation sites promoting
RAGE-mediated ATP production. We transfected expression plasmids into tumor cells that
expressed either wild-type RAGE or alanine for serine mutants (S377A, S399A, S377A/
S399A). When compared with wild-type RAGE, S377A and S377A/S399A mutants
impaired both basal and HMGB1-mediated localization of mitRAGE, p-CxI and subsequent
ATP production, whereas S399A was equally effective as the wild type (Figure 4i). Thus, it
appears that the mitochondrial localization signal, Ser377 of RAGE, is required for
HMGB1-mediated RAGE activation within the mitochondria.
Targeting the HMGB1/RAGE axis decreases in vivo tumor growth To determine whether
blocking the HMGB1–RAGE axis decreases tumor growth in vivo, we inoculated C57/BL6
mice subcutaneously with Panc02 tumor cells, following transfection with control or RAGEspecific shRNA. We then treated them with ethyl pyruvate (EP), a pharmacological inhibitor
of nuclear HMGB1 to cytosol translocation and secretion.24 In vivo, growth of RAGE
knockdown tumor cells was significantly slower than controls (Figure 5a). Growth of
control shRNA-transfected tumors was significantly inhibited at an effective dose of EP (40
mg/kg), but not in the RAGE shRNA group (Figure 5a). We also monitored markers of
apoptosis (cleaved-polyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), expression of B-cell lymphoma 2
(Bcl-2)), inflammation (p-NFκB p65 (p-p65)) and autophagy (microtubule-associated
protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I/II) on day 42. Targeted interference of HMGB1/RAGE
signaling increased markers of apoptosis (PARP) and decreased markers of inflammation (p-

p65), autophagy (LC3-II), ATP production and complex I activity (Figure 5b). In vitro, EP
at a dose of 10 mM inhibits HMGB1 release.24 Low-dose EP (10 mM) did not influence
cellular proliferation (Figure 5c). However, high-dose EP (for example,40 mM) significantly
inhibited proliferation (Figure 5c). Similarly, the complex I inhibitor Rote resulted in a dosedependent inhibition of HMGB1-induced tumor cell proliferation (Figure 1e). In addition,
the infiltration of CD11b-positive inflammatory cells (for example, monocytes/
macrophages, and possibly myeloid-derived suppressor cells) was significantly decreased
after EP treatment and/or RAGE knockdown (Figure 5d), suggesting that HMGB1/RAGE
can influence the tumor microenvironment. We also observed that wild-type tumors
expressing RAGE, when implanted into RAGE −/− mice, have significantly decreased tumor
growth and about 30–40% less ATP production when compared with those implanted in
wild-type mice (Figures 5e and f). This suggests that non-tumor cells within the tumor
microenvironment have critical roles within the HMGB1/RAGE signaling system.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We previously reported that HMGB1 is a critical regulator of apoptosis and autophagy in
response to metabolic and therapeutic stress.20,25–28 We hypothesized that the role of
HMGB1 in pancreatic tumor survival might involve alterations in tumor bioenergetics. We
indeed observed that recombinant HMGB1 or endogenous HMGB1 in necrotic tumor cell
lysates increased ATP levels in both human and murine tumor cell lines. Although HMGB1
has been classically linked to increased inflammation, our studies have now linked it to
alterations in tumor metabolism. Although HMGB1 is generally expressed at high levels in
all nucleated cells, we observed increased expression of HMGB1 in human pancreatic tumor
tissue when compared with nontransformed adjacent tissues, suggesting that tumors may
also utilize this function of HMGB1 to promote progression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HMGB1 interacts with several cell surface receptors, including RAGE, the toll-like
receptors-4 (TLR-4) and −2 (TLR-2), and CD24/ Siglec 10, the latter serving as a negative
signaling molecule, limiting inflammation.29 Our findings suggest that RAGE is the major
receptor responsible for the HMGB1-mediated effects on ATP production (Figure 6). RAGE
consists of three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane
domain and a cytosolic domain. Antibodies neutralizing RAGE and targeted knockdown
full-length RAGE inhibit HMGB1-mediated ATP production. It is interesting to note that
the targeted knockdown of RAGE leads to a decrease in basal ATP levels and mitochondrial
respiration, but neutralizing antibodies do not. This suggests that constitutive expression of
intracellular RAGE is necessary to support optimal ATP production in the steady state. ExRAGE is important, but not essential for extracellular HMGB1-mediated ATP production.
In contrast, cyt-RAGE is sufficient to drive HMGB1-induced ATP production. A recent
study indicates that endocytosis pathways directly mediate extracellular HMGB1 uptake into
cells.16 We found that the caveolin inhibitor indomethacin inhibited HMGB1-mediated ATP
production when cyt-RAGE was overexpressed in RAGE knockdown cells, suggesting that
the caveolin-dependent endocytosis pathway mediated HMGB1-induced activation of cytRAGE in the absence of ex-RAGE (Figure 6).
The identification of the precise molecular signaling pathways by which RAGE signals, has
been a topic of substantial inquiry and investigation. RAGE is present in the immune
precipitates of mitochondrial extracts, where the immune precipitates of complex I and II
contain RAGE. In addition, recent studies also found that HMGB1 can be located to
mitochondria,20,30 suggesting the HMGB1–RAGE pathway’s special role in mitochondria.
It remains unclear exactly to which protein RAGE binds, and whether RAGE recognizes
already bound HMGB1. In pancreatic tumor cell lines, we found that exogenous HMGB1
induced phosphorylation of RAGE at Ser377, and its association with p-ERK1/2 as critical

steps in the regulation of mitRAGE location and tumor cell metabolism. Recent studies
suggest that p-ERK1/2 in the outer membrane and intermembrane space is a crucial
mitochondrial kinase to regulate molecular transport and mitochondrial respiration.31–34 We
demonstrate that there is a direct interaction between RAGE and p-ERK1/2, and ERK
inhibitors and MEK2 siRNA inhibit HMGB1-induced p-RAGE and mitRAGE. Numerous
RAGE protein isoforms are detectable in tissues and cell lines,35 supporting the possible
presence of RAGE in different organelles by post-translational modification and proteolytic
cleavages. Production of sRAGE through transmembrane cleavage by ADAM-10 of the cell
surface protein has been described,31 although the mitRAGE expressed appears to be full
length, and we favor directed transport of newly synthesized RAGE. We found that mutating
the mitochondrial localization signal (Ser377A mutant), or a dominant negative mutant that
retains surface and transmembrane RAGE (exm-RAGE) impaired the localization of
mitRAGE and subsequent ATP production. These findings suggest that ERK1/2-mediated
phosphorylation of RAGE at Ser377 regulates its mitochondrial location.
RAGE−/− mice are resistant to 9, 10-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene/12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced skin carcinogenesis36 and mutant KRASinduced pancreatic tumorigenesis.9,37 Targeted inhibition of the HMGB1/RAGE pathway in
vivo impairs pancreatic tumor growth that is associated with decreased tumor ATP levels
and inflammation.

It has been appreciated for some time that alterations in metabolism are critical to allow for
a selective growth advantage of transformed cells and cancer progression. A growing body
of literature has focused on the ability of common oncogenes to alter metabolic pathways
(specifically glycolysis). The hypothesis is that acquired mutations in these oncogenes, over
time, confer a selective growth advantage to the tumor cell.1,3 We propose a provocative
new model in which inflammatory signals within the tumor microenvironment might also
promote favorable tumor bioenergetics supporting tumor progression. In the setting of
cancer, frequently associated with hypoxia, it may also be released during nutrient
deprivation, oncogenic stress or other circumstances associated with enhanced autophagy,
an important regulator of cellular metabolism.38 In the setting of cancer, HMGB1 promotes
RAGE translocation to mitochondria, leading to enhanced complex I activity and increased
ATP production. Key steps in the bioenergetic pathways that can be influenced by signaling
pathways include PI3K/PTEN/AKT, LKB1/ AMPK and STAT3.39 We have also
demonstrated that RAGE-mediated autophagy is required for IL-6-induced mitochondrial
translocation of STAT3 and subsequently, IL-6/STAT3-mediated ATP production.40
However, IL-6 cannot induce mitochondrial translocation of RAGE. These studies suggest
that there are at least two different mechanisms involved in RAGE-mediated ATP
production: mitRAGE dependent and RAGE-mediated autophagy dependent. It would be
interesting to identify the genes and mechanisms that mediate the crosstalk between these
two pathways.
In summary, we observe that HMGB1 stimulates pancreatic tumor cell proliferation and
ATP production. Through cell fractionation experiments and confocal microscopy, we
demonstrate that a proportion of RAGE is present in the mitochondria, where it associates
with complex I and II. HMGB1 increases the levels of RAGE in the mitochondria, and
tumors show increased RAGE expression relative to normal tissues. HMGB1 induces
RAGE serine phosphorylation (through MEK2/ERK), and S377 is critical for mitochondrial
location of RAGE and ATP production. Inhibition of HMGB1 or RAGE reduces tumor
growth. These findings support clinical development of agents that target HMGB1 or RAGE
for the treatment of human adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and likely many other epithelial
neoplasms.

created mutating Ser377 to Ala377 and/or Ser399 to Ala399 in RAGE in the pAcGFP-C2RAGE plasmid using the following primers: 5′GGAAGGCCCCGGAAGCCCAGGAGGATGAGGAG-3′ (S377A forward primer); 5′CTCCTCATCCTCCTGGGCTTCCGGGGCCTTCC-3′ (S377A reverse primer); 5′GCAGAGCTGAATCAGGCCGAGGAAGCGGAGATG-3′ (S399A forward primer); 5′CATCTCCGCTTCCTCGGCCTGATTCAGCTCTGC-3′ (S399A reverse primer). All
plasmid mutants were sequence-verified.
Empty vector, vectors encoding wild-type RAGE, and individual mutants of RAGE were
transfected into Panc02 cells using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied
Science, Stockholm, Sweden). Stable clones were obtained with G418 (400 µg/ml) selection
for 2–3 weeks.
Isolation and subcellular fractionation of mitochondria

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Subcellular fractionation of pancreatic tissue and pancreatic tumor cells was carried out with
mitochondria isolation kits obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA). Cells were harvested
by centrifuging at 850 g for 2 min. The pellet was suspended with 800 µl of Reagent A and
then incubated for exactly 2 min on ice, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Next,
10 µl of Reagent B was added to the suspended solution and incubated for 5 min on ice with
vortexing at maximum speed every minute. For tissues, 50–200 mg of tissue was washed
twice with 2–4 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After carefully removing and
discarding the PBS wash, the tissue was cut into small pieces and 800 µl of bovine serum
albumin/ Reagent A solution was added. Dounce homogenization was performed on ice, and
800 µl of Reagent C was then added to the solution and the tube was inverted several times
to mix. The solution was centrifuged at 700 g for 10 min at 4°C, and the pellet was used for
the crude nuclei fraction. The supernatant was continuously centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min
at 4°C and transferred to a new tube to obtain the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction.
The pellet was washed with 500 µl of Reagent C and centrifuged at 1 2000 g for 5 min, then
used for isolation of the mitochondrial fraction. To confirm that these were the appropriate
fractions, the western blots were probed for cytochrome c oxidase IV as a mitochondrial
marker, tubulin as a cytoplasmic marker, calnexin as an endoplasmic reticulum marker and
histone H3 as a nuclear marker. In most experiments, we detected little or no tubulin or
calnexin in the mitochondrial fraction.

Subcutaneous tumor models
To generate murine subcutaneous tumors, 106 normal Panc02 cells or cells stably transfected
with control or RAGE-specific shRNA were injected subcutaneously to the right of the
dorsal midline in wild-type or RAGE−/− mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine,
USA, and a kind gift from Angelika Bierhaus, Heidelberg, respectively) as previously
described.7 Both wild-type and RAGE −/− mice were on a C57BL/6 background,41 and were
housed in conventional caging in a pathogen-free and under negative-pressure conditions.
Tumors were measured twice weekly, and volumes were calculated using the formula length
× width2 × π/6. The procedures for performing animal experiments were approved, and in
accordance with the principles and guidelines of the University of Pittsburgh Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.

Western blotting

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Proteins in the cell lysate were resolved on 4–12% Criterion XT Bis-Tris gels (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as previously
described.6,7 After blocking, the membrane was incubated for 2h at 25 °C or overnight at
4°C with various primary antibodies. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C, the signals were visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative band
intensity was quantified using the Gel-pro Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda,
MD, USA).
RNA interference
RAGE-short hairpin RNA (shRNA), TLR2-shRNA, TLR4-shRNA, CD24-shRNA, p65shRNA and control-shRNA were obtained from Sigma, and transfected into cells using the
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. To generate stable shRNA expressing lines, positive cells were
selected with 1–2 µg/ml puromycin for 2–3 weeks. MEK2-small interfering RNA (siRNA)
and control-siRNA from Santa Cruz Technology were transfected into cells using XtremeGENE siRNA reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Immunofluorescence analysis
Cells were cultured on glass coverslips and fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 30 min at room
temperature prior to detergent extraction with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 25 °C.
Coverslips were saturated with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room
temperature, and processed for immunofluorescence with primary antibodies followed by
Alexa Fluor 488 or Cy3-conjugated IgG (Invitrogen), respectively. Nuclear morphology was
analyzed with the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 (Invitroge). Between all incubation steps,
cells were washed three times for 3 min with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Images
were taken with an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope (Olympus Corp, Tokyo,
Japan), and fluorescence signals were measured by Image-Pro Plus platform (Media
Cybernetics).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For tissue immunofluorescence analysis, tissues were embedded in an optimum cutting
temperature cryomedium (Sakura, Zoeterwoude, the Netherlands) and subsequently, cut into
8 µm sections as previously described.2 Tissue sections were stained with HMGB1, RAGE
or CD11b antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 488- or Cy3-conjugated IgG, respectively.
Nuclear morphology was analyzed with the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342. Mitochondria
were imaged following staining with a complex I antibody (Mitosciences).
Immunoprecipitation analysis
Cells were lysed at 4 °C in ice-cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation lysis buffer
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (12000 g,
10 min). Concentrations of proteins in the supernatant were determined by bicinchoninic
acid assay. Prior to immunoprecipitation, samples containing equal amount of proteins were
pre-cleared with Protein A or Protein G agarose/sepharose (Millipore) (4°C, 3 h), and
subsequently incubated with various irrelevant IgG or specific antibodies (2–5 µg/ml) in the
presence of Protein A or G agarose/sepharose beads for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C with gentle
shaking. Following incubation, agarose/ sepharose beads were washed extensively with
PBS, and proteins were eluted by boiling in 2 × sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer
before SDS–PAGE electrophoresis. To detect phosphorylation of RAGE and complex I, cell

ATP assay
The ATP content in whole cell or tissue extracts was determined with a luminescent ATP
detection kit (ATPlite, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The luminescent intensity was measured using a microplate
reader (Synergy 2, BioTek instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). In parallel, cell number in
whole cell samples and protein concentration in the tissue extracts were conventionally
determined by trypan blue exclusion or bicinchoninic acid assay, respectively. The results in
cells are expressed as relative ATP level compared to controls after normalizing for cell
number. The results in tissues are expressed as relative ATP level compared to controls after
normalizing for protein concentration.
Complex I enzyme activity assay
The activity of complex I was determined with a Complex I Enzyme Activity Assay Kit
(Mitosciences), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
NF- κB activation assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were transiently transfected in a 12-well plate with NF- κB luciferase reporter plasmid
and control empty plasmid using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24–48 h, the cells were exposed to various agents.
The luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system with the reporter
lysis buffer obtained from Promega (Madison, WI, USA), as previously described.42 The
results are expressed as relative NF- κB activity after normalizing for the control empty
plasmid.
Transwell migration assay
Transmigration of pancreatic tumor cells was performed as previously described.43,44
Described briefly, 0.47cm2 transwells (Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) with polycarbonate
membranes (8 µm pore size) were coated with gelatin (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells (5 ×
104) were seeded on top of transwell filters in RPMI containing 2% fetal bovine serum and
allowed to migrate towards RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence or
presence of HMGB1/Rote in the lower compartment of the transwell system for 20–24 h.
The number of cells that migrated was estimated by trypan blue staining.
OXPHOS and glycolysis assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cellular OXPHOS and glycolysis were monitored using the Seahorse Bioscience
Extracellular Flux Analyzer (XF24, Seahorse Bioscience Inc., North Billerica, MA, USA)
by measuring the OCR, indicative of respiration and ECR, indicative of glycolysis in real
time as previously described.20 Described briefly, 30 000–50 000 cells were seeded in 24well plates designed for XF24 in 150 µl of appropriate growth media and incubated
overnight. Prior to performing measurements, cells were washed once with unbuffered
media, then immersed in 675 µl unbuffered media and incubated in the absence of CO2 for 1
h. The OCR and ECR were then measured in a typical 8-min cycle of mix (2–4 min), dwell
(2 min) and measure (2–4 min) as recommended by Seahorse Bioscience. The basal levels
of OCR and ECR were recorded first, followed by the OCR and ECR levels following
injection of compounds that inhibit the respiratory mitochondrial electron transport chain,
ATP synthesis or glycolysis. Each reading under specific conditions was repeated at least
three times.

Statistical analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Data are expressed as means±s.d. of two or three independent experiments performed in
triplicate. One-way ANOVA was used for comparison among the different groups. When
the ANOVA was significant, post hoc testing of differences between groups was performed
using Fisher’s least significant difference test. Otherwise, Student’s t-test was used for
comparison of the means of two groups. A P-value <.05 was considered significant.

We dedicate this manuscript to the memory of Angelika Bierhaus, PhD, our friend and benefactor. She was a
pioneering RAGE biologist, generous and kind in her dealings with colleagues, who provided us the mice with
which we completed this work, and who sadly passed away on 15 April 2012 after a long and courageous battle
with cancer. Angelika had a great love of life and she was generous, kind and warm hearted. She was always full of
plans for scientific endeavors, even when her disease began to take its toll. She steadfastly denied that she would be
defeated, recently celebrating her 50th birthday; however, she was aware that her remaining time was short. She
dedicated herself to research, but despite her incredible strength, she was not able to overcome the disease, which
tragically took her life.We thank Christine Heiner (University of Pittsburgh. Department of Surgery) for her critical

RAGE is required for HMGB1-mediated ATP production. (a) C57/BLl6 mice were
inoculated with 106 Panc02 tumor cells following transfection of control or RAGE-specific
shRNA and treated with an HMGB1 inhibitor, ‘EP’, 40 mg/kg, or PBS beginning on day 7.
Tumors were measured twice weekly, and volumes were calculated for 42 days (mean ±s.d.,
n = 5, *P<0.001 ctrl shRNA versus RAGE shRNA; #P<0.01 ctrl shRNA versus ctrl shRNA
+ EP). (b) On day 42 in the experiments described in (a), serum HMGB1 (left) and protein
levels of C-PARP, Bcl-2, p-p65 and LC3-I/II (right) in tumor samples were assayed by
western blotting. The relative optical intensity of the HMGB1-immunoreactive band (in
arbitrary units, AU) is shown in a scatter plot with the mean represented by a solid line (n =
5, *P<0.001 versus ctrl shRNA). The inset shows a representative western blot. In parallel,
relative ATP levels and complex I activity in tumor tissue were evaluated, with ctrl shRNA
set as 1 (mean ± s.d., n = 3, *P <0.001 versus ctrl shRNA). (c) Dose-response effects of EP
on cellular proliferation in Panc02 and Panc2.03 cells. (d) On day 42 as described in (a), the
percentage of CD11b positive cells in tumor tissue was evaluated (mean ± s.d., n=3,
*P<0.001). (e) RAGE wild-type (+/+) and knockout (−/−) mice were inoculated with 0.5–1
× 106 Panc02 tumor cells. Tumors were measured twice weekly, and tumor volumes

Model of HMGB1/RAGE interaction and regulation of metabolism. HMGB1 is released
following stress/necrosis in cells as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule in the
tumor microenvironment, promoting inflammation. HMGB1 binds cell membrane RAGE or
uptake into cells by a caveolin-dependent endocytosis pathway, promoting phosphorylation
of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), which in turn induces phosphorylation of RAGE. Phosphorylation
of RAGE at Ser377 is required for its mitochondria-targeted accumulation. There it
promotes phosphorylation of complex I, which is the first step in the ATP biosynthetic
pathway. As shown in the summary, the HMGB1–RAGE pathway stimulates bioenergetics
