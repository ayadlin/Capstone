BACKGROUND: Recent work has suggested a role for nuclear factor jB (NF-jB) in the propagation of ovarian cancer
cell lines, but the significance and mechanism of NF-jB in ovarian cancer is unknown. The authors hypothesized that
the NF-jB pathway is over activated in aggressive ovarian cancers. METHODS: The levels of 3 NF-jB transcription
factors, the activating inhibitors of NF-jB (IjB) kinases, and the NF-jB target matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)
were assessed by immunohistochemistry in specimens of ovarian cancer that were obtained at diagnosis from a
cohort of 33 patients who subsequently received combined paclitaxel, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide. Associations
were made between NF-jB pathway proteins and outcome. The validation of coexpression was performed at the
gene level in 2 independently collected cohorts of 185 and 153 ovarian cancers. RESULTS: The presence of NF-jB
proteins in newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancers was established, and a potential association with overall
survival was identified. Transcription factors p65 and v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog B (RelB)
were coexpressed with IjB kinase a, 1 component of a key trimolecular regulatory complex. Coexpression of the
NF-jB machinery suggested activity of NF-jB signaling in these ovarian tumors. A significant association of p50 with
poor overall survival was observed (P ¼ .02). MMP9 expression had the opposite association, in which patients who
had tumors without MMP9 staining had the poorest prognosis (P ¼ .01), and this association held true at the gene
expression level in an independently collected cohort of 185 ovarian cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The deregulation of
NF-jB activity may influence outcome in women who receive standard therapy for advanced ovarian cancer. Modification of the NF-jB pathway may present an opportunity to improve outcome in the subset of women who have

The nuclear factor jB (NF-jB) family of transcription factors is expressed in many tissue types and has been studied
extensively in lymphoid development and lymphoid malignancies. Constitutive NF-jB signaling also has been identified
in tumors of epithelial origin, including breast, colon, lung, and ovarian carcinomas.1 Recent work has suggested the
importance of NF-jB in the propagation of ovarian cancer cell lines,2 but the significance and the mechanism of NF-jB
signaling in ovarian cancer remains unknown.
We hypothesized that the NF-jB pathway would be over activated in ovarian cancers with more aggressive behavior.
Evidence supporting this hypothesis was derived from ovarian cancer cell lines and malignant ascites. The NF-jB pathway
has been implicated in ovarian cancer proliferation and cytokine secretion in vitro2,3 and also may contribute to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cell lines.3-5 Therefore, we sought to determine the expression patterns and prognostic associations of NF-jB pathway proteins in primary ovarian cancer tissues.

NF-jB Proteins in Ovarian Cancer/Annunziata et al

The NF-jB family of transcription factors consists
of 5 subunits that join into active dimers. Homodimers or
heterodimers form the active transcription factor complex, which is retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitors of
NF-jB (IjBs). The transcription factors are released
when IjBs are phosphorylated by IjB kinases (IKKs)
upon activation by upstream stimuli. The tumor microenvironment triggers intracellular NF-jB activation by
diverse cell surface receptors, providing a link between
inflammation and cancer.6 Specific inducible phosphorylation by IKKs targets IjBs for degradation through the
proteasome. For this reason, the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib is under evaluation in clinical trials attempting to block NF-jB-mediated chemoresistance and resensitize ovarian cancers to platinum agents.7
Active NF-jB transcription factors alter transcription of specific target genes involved in a wide array of cellular functions, including proliferation, angiogenesis, and
metastasis.8 Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is a
known target gene that contains the NF-jB consensus
sequence in its promoter.9 This matrix metalloproteinase
has been linked to angiogenesis and metastasis in mouse
xenograft models of ovarian cancer,10,11 prompting its
consideration in the current study.
We examined the cellular expression frequency of 3
NF-jB subunits; the activating kinases IKKa, IKKb, and
IKKe; and the NF-jB target gene MMP9 by immunohistochemistry in an independent and blinded set of ovarian
cancer specimens that were obtained at diagnosis. The
cohort was a set of 33 patients who subsequently received
a 3-drug chemotherapy regimen of paclitaxel, cisplatin,
and cyclophosphamide in a clinical trial at the National
Cancer Institute (NCI).12 Outcome data were available
with up to 9-year follow-up, and the association between
outcomes and expression of NF-jB pathway proteins was
determined. Our analysis was extended to 2 independent
gene expression datasets to further validate the associations discovered in the protein expression of these factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Women with advanced stage, newly diagnosed epithelial
ovarian cancer were treated between 1995 and 2001 using
a triple-drug regimen of cisplatin, high-dose paclitaxel,
and cyclophosphamide.12-14 Briefly, patients received intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 on Day 1, paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 as a 24-hour infusion beginning on Day
1, and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 2. Cycles were repeated

disease that were obtained at from the initial staging and
from cytoreductive surgery were collected according to
the NCI institutional review board-approved protocol
and consent. Tissue blocks from 33 of the 62 enrolled
patients (Table 1) were available and contained tumor tissue adequate for immunohistochemical staining.
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were analyzed for protein expression of IKKa, IKKb, IKKe, p50,
p65, v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog B
(RelB), and MMP9 using immunohistochemistry. Staining was performed manually. Antibody specifications and
staining conditions are detailed in Table 2. Negative controls consisted of sections that underwent similar staining
procedures with a nonrelevant antibody of the corresponding isotype. Positive controls consisted of solid ovarian carcinomas that demonstrated immunoreactivity for
the studied antigens in a pilot study. Visualization was
achieved using the EnVisionþ peroxidase system (Dako,
Carpenteria, Calif). Staining was considered positive and
was scored in either a cytoplasmic or nuclear location for
p50 and p65. RelB, IKKa, IKKb, IKKe, and MMP9

produced only cytoplasmic expression and, thus, were
scored only at this subcellular localization. The extent of
staining was scored on a scale from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no
tumor cells stained; 1, 1% to 5% of tumor cells stained; 2,
6% to 25% of tumor cells stained; 3, 26% to 75% of tumor cells stained; and 4, 76% to 100% of tumor cells
stained. All sections contained a large number of viable tumor cells. Specimens were scored by 2 experienced surgical pathologists (B.D., A.B.) in a blinded fashion. Only
tumor cells were scored.
Statistical Methods
A Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test was used to determine
statistical associations between the markers. All P values
for these associations are 2-tailed and have not been
adjusted for multiple comparisons. In view of the large
number of comparisons in this exploratory analysis, only
P < .005 should be interpreted as indicating statistically
significant results, and analyses in which .005 < P < .05
would reflect trends.
Reliable, complete clinical information was available
on 31 of the 33 patients who had tissue blocks available.
We analyzed the relations of age, survival, and progression
with categorical data from 9 parameters. The association
between age and immunohistochemistry score for each
marker was determined using a Jonckheere-Terpstra test
for trend if there were 3 categories to evaluate,15 and a
Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used if there were markers in
only 2 categories. Associations between marker values and
response (classified as complete response [CR] vs partial
response [PR] vs stable disease [SD] or CR versus PR þ
SD) were determined using either the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for trend, a Cochran-Armitage trend test,16 or a

3278

Fisher exact test, depending on the number of categories
evaluated in each parameter.
The immunohistochemistry data typically were
grouped into categories to allow a minimum of 4 patients
per category, and the resulting groupings were evaluated
for their prognostic association with survival and progression-free survival. Durations of survival and progression
were computed from the on-study date until the date of
death or progression, respectively, or until the last known
follow-up. The probability of survival or of progressionfree survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and the log-rank test was used to determine the
statistical significance of the difference among KaplanMeier curves.17,18 A Cox proportional hazards model was
used to determine the statistical significance of 2 factors
considered jointly on outcome, when appropriate.19 All
P values are 2-tailed and are presented without adjustment
for multiple testing performed, with the exception of
adjusted P values that were based on pooling categories after identifying a potentially useful division in the data relative to survival.
Gene Expression Profiling
Data were obtained from GEO dataset GSE3149 (available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?
acc¼GSE3149; accessed February 2010)20 and from personal communication.21 The following probe sets were
used for analysis: MMP9 (203936_s_at), IKBKB
(209341_s_at), conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase (CHUK) (209666_s_at), IKBKE (204549_at), RELB
(205205_at), NFKB1 (209239_at), NFKB2 (209636_at),
and RELA (209878_s_at). Samples were ordered by the
average expression of the NF-jB transcription factors.

Correlation with this value was calculated for each probe
set. The strength of association (P value) was calculated by
using another website (available at: http://faculty.vassar.

RESULTS
Patients and Samples
The tissue samples analyzed in this study were collected
prospectively from patients who received initial therapy
with cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and cisplatin for epithelial ovarian cancer.12-14 The regimen resulted in a
pathologic CR or microscopic residual disease in 84% of
patients. The median overall survival for all women enrolled on the clinical trial is 68 months, and the median
progression-free survival is 19.8 months. For the subset of
31 patients for whom tumor tissue and clinical data were
available and adequate, the respective medians are 65
months and 14.7 months, indicating that these patients
are approximately representative of the larger group from
which they were obtained. The patients were relatively homogenous in terms of disease stage (all stage III/IV), tumor grade (82% grade 3), and histology (67% serous)
(Table 1).
NF-jB Transcription Factors p65 and RelB
Are Coexpressed in Ovarian Cancer
We investigated components of the NF-jB signaling
pathway including 3 NF-jB subunits; the activating
kinases IKKa, IKKb, and IKKe; and the NF-jB target
gene MMP9 (Fig. 1A). Cellular frequency of expression
was determined by immunohistochemistry (Table 2) in
this blinded set of ovarian cancer specimens. Nine events
were tabulated on the 33 evaluable specimens: cytoplasmic or nuclear staining of p50 and p65 were quantified as
individual events; whereas only cytoplasmic localization
of RelB, IKKa, IKKb, IKKe, and MMP9 was identified
and quantified (Table 3; see representative staining in
Fig. 1B). The 2 pathologists who scored the slides had
good interobserver agreement (80%), and discrepant cases
(usually of 1 scoring level) were resolved in a consensus
session.
We evaluated correlations between expression levels
of the individual proteins in the ovarian cancer specimens.
The transcription factors p65 and RelB were closely coexpressed in the ovarian cancer specimens (Fig. 2A). These 2
proteins were present together with IKKa, an activator of
both classic and alternative NF-jB signaling.1 In view of
the large number of comparisons in this exploratory anal-

jB target, MMP9, approached but did not reach statistical significance (P ¼ .0053, P ¼ .0052, and P ¼ .0083,
respectively). These close correlations suggest that the
NF-jB pathway may be active in a subset of ovarian
cancers.

Independent Confirmation of Activation of
the NF-jB Pathway in Ovarian Cancer Gene
Expression Datasets
Associations between NF-jB components were evaluated at the gene expression level in 2 independent,
publicly available ovarian cancer datasets (Fig.
2B,C).20,21 An expression average was calculated for
the 3 transcription factors NFKB1, RELA, and RELB

3280

for each dataset. The correlation (R) of each gene and
the level of significance (P) with the transcription factor average were calculated to compare the relations
observed in the 2 datasets (Fig. 2B,C). In addition,
correlations between individual genes were calculated
within each dataset. An association between expression
of the NF-jB transcription factors RELA (the gene for
p65) and RELB was evident again in these 2 separate
groups of patient samples, which were collected at the
time of initial diagnosis (Dataset 1, P ¼ 6e-5; Dataset
2, P ¼ 1e-7). The coexpression of RELB with MMP9
was highly significant (Dataset 1, P ¼ 7e-5; Dataset 2,
P ¼ 5e-7), whereas a correlation between RELA and
MMP9 was suggested (Dataset 1, P ¼ .26; Dataset 2,
P ¼ .01). The correlation of RELA and RELB with

NF-jB Transcription Factor p50 Is Associated
With Poor Survival in Newly Diagnosed
Patients
The immunohistochemistry data were grouped into categories to allow for a minimum of 4 patients per category.
Each marker set was evaluated for correlations with overall
survival and progression-free survival. Elevated expression
(3-4þ; n ¼ 18 patients) of cytosolic p50 (c-p50) had a
potential association with shorter overall survival compared with lower c-p50 expression (0-2þ; n ¼ 13
patients; P ¼ .02 unadjusted; P ¼ .065 after adjustment)
(Fig. 3A). Cytoplasmic p65 was grouped into 2 to 3þ
(n ¼ 5 patients) or 4þ (n ¼ 25 patients), because no spec-

imen had <6% cells stained positive. Patients with elevated expression of c-p65 had a trend toward shorter
overall survival (P ¼ .14) and progression-free survival
(P ¼ .05).
MMP9 protein levels had the opposite association,
in which patients without MMP9 staining had the poorest
prognosis (Fig, 3B) (P ¼ .01 unadjusted; P ¼ .02 after
adjustment). A similar pattern, but to a lesser degree, was
observed in an independent dataset of 185 gene expression
profiles (Dataset 2), suggesting that lower MMP9 expression may be associated with shorter overall survival (data
not shown).
The immunohistochemistry results indicated that
the 2 proteins c-p50 and MMP9 were related to overall
survival in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.
Because each had an unadjusted P value <.05, both were

(C) Combined analysis of p50 and MMP9 in patients with ovarian cancer revealed that the median survival of patients who had unfavorable staining for both markers was 24.5 months, and the median survival of patients who had favorable expression of both markers was not reached.

group was 30.4 months (P ¼ .003 for global comparison of all 3 arms). (D) A Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze immunoreactivity for MMP9 and p50 in patients with ovarian cancer.

evaluated for their joint association with survival in a Cox
proportional hazards model (Fig. 3D). Each retained a
P value <.05 when they were considered together and,
thus, provided independent prognostic information for
patients who were evaluated from the triple-therapy clinical trial. Patients who were favorable for both markers
(lower c-p50 and any MMP9 staining; n ¼ 15) had the
best prognosis, whereas patients who were unfavorable for
both markers (higher c-p50 and absent MMP9 staining;
n ¼ 3 patients) had a dramatically shorter overall survival
(P ¼ .003) (Fig. 3C). A similar level of significance was
evident again when patients were grouped into 2 categories: those with both markers favorable (n ¼ 12 patients;
median survival not reached) and those with either marker
unfavorable (n ¼ 18 patients; median survival, 29.1
months; P ¼ .0049).

DISCUSSION
NF-jB signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of cancers derived from either lymphoid or epithelial origin. We

3282

established the presence of the NF-jB pathway proteins
in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancers and investigated a potential link with overall survival
in women who were treated on an experimental tripledrug regimen. It is noteworthy that the transcription factors p65 and RelB were coexpressed with IKKa, which is
1 component of a key trimolecular regulatory complex.
This coexpression of the NF-jB machinery in ovarian
cancer tumor samples suggests that NF-jB signaling
occurs in a subset of tumors.
Immunohistochemistry is a semiquantitative technique when staining intensity is evaluated. In the current
analysis, however, we quantified the number of cells that
were positive without introducing the subjective measure
of staining intensity. The number of positive cells for a
particular protein were categorized into scores between 0
and 4þ, and the results were evaluated as categorical variables. This method of evaluating immunohistochemical
results has been used in several previous studies because it
greatly reduces bias and results in little inter-reviewer variability.22,23 In the current study, we extended our analyses

to the expression of these factors in gene expression datasets to corroborate the immunohistochemical findings.
The coexpression of the NF-jB transcription factors
was validated further in 2 independent datasets of gene
expression in ovarian cancer specimens. Analyses of these
large datasets were included to expand and independently
verify the relations that we observed in a relatively smaller
set of patient samples. Coordinated expression of the NFjB transcription factors in both of these large datasets
provides confidence in our analysis of the prospectively
collected patient samples. Furthermore, the prognostic
correlation of MMP9 loss was recapitulated at the gene
expression level in the large set of 185 samples from
patients who had survival data available. This was an
unexpected finding, because the expression of MMP9 in
ovarian cancer models has been linked to a poor
outcome.24
Paradoxically, the presence of any MMP9 in ovarian
cancer cells was associated with a better outcome in this
group of patients compared with cases patients who had
no MMP9 protein detected. MMP9 is a known target
gene of NF-jB transcription factors and, thus, was
intended to serve as an indicator of NF-jB activity in
ovarian cancer. Elevated MMP9 expression has been
linked to enhanced angiogenesis and metastasis in several
studies of ovarian cancer cell line models.10,11,25,26
Increased expression of MMP9 either in ovarian cancer
cells or in surrounding stromal cells has been associated
with shorter disease-free and overall survival in women
advanced-stage ovarian cancers.24 Thus, the opposite
trend in prognosis with MMP9 expression among the
patients in our clinical trial was unexpected.
The trend of low MMP9 and poor prognosis, however, was corroborated in a large, independent gene
expression dataset of 185 serous ovarian cancer specimens
and suggested that this may be a unique subset of
advanced stage ovarian cancers that depend on other proteases for their invasive behavior. Such behavior has been
demonstrated in the setting of MMP9 knock-out, in
which increased angiogenesis and accelerated growth of
tumors was observed.27 Given the retrospective nature of
these studies, this unexpected finding is exploratory and
warrants confirmation in a larger set of samples.
The tumors that were included in the current analysis were relatively homogeneous with respect to advanced
stage and grade. Thus, we sought to differentiate between
the aggressive tumors and observed that p50 was best at
distinguishing prognostic groups. Frequent expression of
NF-jB transcription factor p50 heralded a poor progno-

sis, which was worsened in the absence of MMP9. Thus,
it is possible that loss of MMP9 signifies further dedifferentiation of these already high-grade tumors and identifies
a unique and differently invasive subset.
Inflammation in the microenvironment can contribute to NF-jB pathway activation in both the
tumor and the stroma as well as resulting from NFKB
activation. The NFKB pathway in these cancers was
scored specifically in the tumor cells within the specimens. However, inflammatory signals may stimulate
tumor growth and promote invasive behavior through
the NF-jB pathway. The expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation primary
response gene 88 (MyD88) in ovarian cancer cells may
facilitate the transmission of environmental stimuli to
NF-jB activation in tumors.3 In addition to stimulating growth and invasion of ovarian cancer, the over
activation of NF-jB leads to resistance to standard
chemotherapy agents, including paclitaxel and cisplatin,3-5 2 drugs that were tested in the clinical trial on
which the current cohort of patients were treated. Our
current work demonstrated a potentially interesting
association of p50 with poor overall survival in women
who received combined cisplatin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide. This finding is consistent with the possibility that NF-jB signaling is a mechanism for
platinum and/or taxane resistance in ovarian cancer.
Nuclear p50 homodimers in tumor-associated macrophages can indicate the suppression of antitumor
response.28 In our study, tumor cell cytosolic p50 provided prognostic information. It is plausible that feedback
mechanisms are in place where NFKB1 (the gene for p50)
is a direct target gene of p65 and becomes up-regulated
for the purpose of attenuating the cascade. This feedback
mechanism may be defective, however, in the ovarian cancer cells, leading to an accumulation of p50 homodimers
in the cytoplasm that fail to down-regulate NF-jB-targeted prosurvival factors in the ovarian cells. This phenomenon has been documented in tumor-associated
macrophages.28
A complex network of signal transduction pathways
are likely to cooperate with NF-jB in promoting the
aggressiveness of ovarian cancer. The precise regulation of
these networks often is disrupted in cancer, allowing tumor growth, dissemination, and resistance to cell death.
Further investigation into the mechanism of NF-jB activity in ovarian cancer will offer new opportunities to
improve outcomes for women with advanced ovarian
cancer.
