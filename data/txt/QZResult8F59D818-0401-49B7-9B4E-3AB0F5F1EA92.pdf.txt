Prostate Cancer Growth and Metastasis

Abstract
Considered a chemopreventive agent, the ability of genistein
to modulate the progression of existing prostate cancer (CaP)
is not clear. We show here that the consumption of genistein
(250 mg/kg diet) by 12-week-old transgenic adenocarcinoma
mouse prostate (TRAMP-FVB) mice harboring prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions until 20 weeks of age induces an
aggressive progression of CaP, as evidenced by a 16% increase
in the number of well-differentiated and poorly differentiated
prostates, coinciding with a 70% incidence of pelvic lymph
node (LN) metastases as opposed to 0% and 10% in 0 and
1,000 mg/kg groups, concomitant with elevated osteopontin
(OPN) expression in prostates and LNs. Equivalent nanomolar
(500 nmol/L) concentrations of genistein recapitulated these
effects in human PC3 CaP cells as evidenced by increased
proliferation, invasion, and matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9) activity (f2-fold), accompanied by an up-regulation
of OPN expression and secretion, compared with vehicletreated cells. A pharmacologic dose (50 Mmol/L) decreased
proliferation, invasion, and MMP-9 activity (>2.0-fold) concomitant with OPN reduction. Upon OPN knockdown by short
hairpin RNA, genistein was no longer effective in upregulating PC3 cell proliferation, invasion, and MMP-9
activation, which were significantly reduced in the absence
of OPN, highlighting the requirement for OPN in mediating
the effects of genistein. Proliferation, invasion, and OPN
levels were also nonsignificantly induced by genistein in
the presence of ICI 182,780 or wortmannin, indicating a
dependence on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and estrogen
signaling. Our results suggest the presence of a biphasic
regulation of CaP growth and metastasis by genistein,
warranting careful examination of the effects of genistein
on hormone-dependent cancers in a chemotherapeutic
setting. [Cancer Res 2009;69(8):3695–703]

Introduction
An estimated f186,320 cases of prostate cancer (CaP) will be
diagnosed in the United States in 2008. About 1 man in 6 will be
diagnosed with CaP during his lifetime, but only 1 man in 35 will
succumb to it, making CaP accountable for f9% of cancer-related
deaths in men (1). Initially treatable when localized, CaP is known
to progress to a clinically hormone-refractory cancer and

metastatic disease to bone, lungs, and regional lymph nodes (LN)
when no effective treatment is available (2).
Observations have suggested that osteopontin (OPN) expression
may be significantly altered in cancer and playing a role in bone
metastasis (3). OPN expression is increased upon neoplastic
transformation (4) and induced by tumor promoters (5) as well
as estrogens (6). Specifically to CaP, OPN is elevated in androgenindependent and tumorigenic prostatic cell lines compared with
normal prostate epithelial and benign prostatic hyperplasia cells.
Increased expression is associated with elevated Gleason scores (7),
increased tumor burden (8), and reduced patient survival (9).
Serum OPN levels are substantially elevated in the blood of patients
with metastatic cancer (10), rendering OPN a useful diagnostic
marker in metastasis detection and an attractive potential target
for CaP therapy.
Epidemiologic observations linking increased soy consumption
and decreased incidence of clinically relevant CaP have generated a
lot of attention about the chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic
effects of genistein, a major component in soy, on the initiation
and progression of CaP (11). We and others have previously shown
that dietary genistein (250 and 1,000 mg/kg diet) inhibits the
incidence of poorly differentiated cancer when consumed by
tumor-free transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP)
mice dose dependently (12, 13). More recently, we have examined
the effect of consumption of previously established chemopreventive genistein doses on CaP progression in mice with
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and observed a surprising
increase in CaP growth at the lower dose used (14). This study
represents a closer examination of dietary effects of genistein on
TRAMP CaP progression when consumed after tumor initiation.
We show that the 250 mg/kg dose, which resulted in nanomolar
serum genistein concentrations, induced a 70% incidence of pelvic
LN metastases, concomitant with activation of Akt and upregulation of OPN. In vitro studies using PC3 cells recapitulated
the induction of proliferation and invasion by nanomolar but not
micromolar doses of genistein, concomitant with Akt activation,
increased OPN expression, and MMP-9 activation, suggesting a
biphasic modulation of proliferation and invasion by genistein in
CaP cells. These effects were no longer observed upon knockdown
of OPN by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and treatment of PC3 cells
with the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI 182,780, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition by wortmannin. This is
the first report showing that consumption of genistein, resulting in
nanomolar concentrations, can enhance the proliferative and
metastatic potential of undiagnosed early-stage CaP and thereby
exacerbate it, via an estrogen- and PI3K-dependent mechanism,
involving the up-regulation of the metastasis promoter OPN.

Georgetown University animal facilities in accordance with approved
protocol guidelines. Heterozygous male offspring, from male and female
TRAMP mated with FVB, were confirmed by genotyping as described (15).
Four- or 12-wk-old transgenic males were fed purified AIN-76A pellets
(Harlan Teklad) supplemented with 0, 250, and 1,000 mg/kg genistein diet
(n = 15/diet group; Sigma) until 20 wk of age. A third group was fed a
regular diet and mice were sacrificed at 5, 9, 18, and 24 wk of age (n = 10/
age group).
Tissue processing and histopathologic evaluation. Mice were
euthanized; blood was collected; and major organs and LNs were dissected
out, fixed, and paraffin embedded. Histopathologic evaluation/scoring was
done as previously described (12) and was reflective of prostatic lobes
minus the anterior prostate.
Serum genistein levels. Serum was extracted and total genistein was
unconjugated as previously described (12) and measured by Time-Resolved
FluoroImmunoAssay according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Labmaster
TRF-genistein).
Immunohistochemistry. LN sections were stained with mouse antiOPN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse anti-SV40-Tag (NeoMarkers)
overnight at 4jC followed by incubation with biotin-labeled (SV40Tag; Invitrogen) or Alexa Fluor–tagged antibody (OPN) for 1 h. Slides
were incubated in Vectastain avidin-biotin complex peroxidase (Vector
Laboratories) for 30 min, developed with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine, and
counterstained with hematoxylin or propidium iodide. Slides were photographed using a camera-equipped microscope (Zeiss AxioPlan2 Imaging
System).
Cell lines. PC3, MCF-7 (American Type Culture Collection), or PC3(OPN )
cells were maintained at 37jC with 5% CO2 in phenol red–free IMEM with
2 mmol/L glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) unless otherwise specified. For OPN knockdown stable cell line
[PC3(OPN )], four different OPN shRNA and two scrambled shRNA
constructs (OriGene Technologies, Inc.) were transfected into retroviral
packaging Phoenix Ampho cells (gift from Dr. Dean Rosenthal, Georgetown
University Medical Center, Washington, DC) with GeneJammer. Forty-eight
hours after transfection, medium was filtered through 0.45 Am and added to
PC3 cells with polybrene (5 Ag/mL). Forty-eight hours after infection, cells
were selected with puromycin, individually cloned, and screened for OPN
expression.
Proliferation assay. PC3 or PC3(OPN ) cells, in triplicates, were treated
with (a) genistein (0, 500, 1,000, and 50,000 nmol/L) for 72 h or (b) F
genistein (500 nmol/L) F ICI 182,780 (50 nmol/L) for 72 h or (c) F genistein
(500 nmol/L) F wortmannin (50 nmol/L) for 72 h and living cells were
counted.
Invasion assay. A PC3 suspension (60,000 cells) in serum-free medium
treated (a) F genistein (500, 1,000, and 50,000 nmol/L) or (b) F genistein
(500 nmol/L) F ICI 182,780 (50 nmol/L) or (c) F genistein (500 nmol/L) F
wortmannin (50 nmol/L) or (d) PC3(OPN ) F genistein (500 nmol/L) for
72 h was subjected to the Boyden chamber assay (BD Biosciences) as
described (16).
Estrogen response element reporter assay. PC3 or MCF-7 cells, in
triplicates, were transfected with ERE-TATA-luciferase (200 ng) and Renilla
luciferase (20 ng) reporter constructs. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
cells were treated with 5 pmol/L estradiol or 500 nmol/L genistein for 5 h.
Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using the Dual Luciferase
Assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s protocol and normalized
to Renilla luciferase activity.
Reverse transcription-PCR. RNA extracted from prostatic tissue or LNs
as described (12) was subjected to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using
the following primers: mouse OPN, 5¶-TGGCAGCTCAGAGGAGAAGCTTTA-3¶
( forward) and 5¶-TCCTGGCTCTCTTTGGAATGCTCA-3¶ (reverse); mouse
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5¶-GGCCATGTCTGAGAGATTGGTCTT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AATAGAAAGGCACAGAGCCAGAGG-3¶ (reverse). PCRs were as follows: 1 min at 94jC, 28 cycles of 94jC
for 30 s, annealing temperature (58jC) for 30 s, 72jC for 45 s, extension at
72jC for 5 min. Yielded PCR products were 627 and 259 bp, respectively.
Western blot analysis. Protein isolation from prostates (minus anterior
prostate lobe) and cell lines was performed as described (12). Membranes

were probed with anti-OPN antibody, Akt, and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt;
Ser473; Cell Signaling) and reprobed for GAPDH (Abcam) to ensure equal
loading.
Human OPN immunoassay. Secreted OPN was measured with
Quantikine Human OPN ELISA (R&D Systems, Inc.) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. PC3 cells were treated with 0, 500, 1,000, and
50,000 nmol/L of genistein for 72 h. Medium was collected every 24 h,
pooled together, and concentrated (1:10) using an Amicon concentrator
with a 50-kDa cutoff (Millipore). Samples and standards were run in
triplicates.
Zymography. Conditioned media collected and pooled from PC3 cells
treated with (a) genistein (0, 500, 1,000, and 50,000 nmol/L), (b) scrambled
shRNA or OPN shRNA stable PC3 cells F genistein (500 nmol/L), and (c)
vehicle- and genistein-treated (500 nmol/L) PC3 cells F ICI 182,780 or F
wortmannin for 72 h were concentrated (f10-fold) and loaded onto SDSPAGE containing 0.1% gelatin for electrophoresis as described by Desai and
colleagues (17).
Statistical analyses. Histologic data were evaluated using m2 analysis
and Fisher’s exact test. Western blots, agarose gels, and gelatin zymography
band intensities were quantified with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD)
and presented as mean F SE from three independent experiments. One-way
ANOVA in Prism 3 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used to compare OPN levels
across age groups and diet groups in vivo, genistein treatments/inhibitors
in WB analyses, and ELISA and active MMP-9 across genistein doses, F
inhibitors, and in PC3(OPN ). Cells were counted in triplicates and invaded
cells were counted from all filters from three independent experiments, and
analysis was carried out between different treatments using one-way ANOVA
followed by Dunnett’s test with a confidence interval of 95%.

Results
A chemopreventive dose of genistein induces pelvic LN
metastasis in TRAMP-FVB mice harboring PIN lesions. We have
previously shown that genistein (250 mg/kg diet), when consumed
by TRAMP-FVB mice with PIN, from 12 to 20 weeks of age, results
in growth stimulation as evidenced by increased prostate weights,
compared with control, independently of SV40-Tag modulation
while resulting in serum genistein concentrations of 429.732 F
83.709 nmol/L (Fig. 1A, top; Supplementary Fig. S1A and B; ref. 14).
This aggressive phenotype is supported by a 16% increase in
prostates with well-differentiated and poorly differentiated cancer
in the 250 mg/kg diet group compared with 0 and 1,000 mg/kg
groups and a 2-fold reduction in prostate numbers at PIN stage
(P < 0.01) with a higher incidence of expression of the neuroendocrine marker synaptophysin (Fig. 1A, bottom; data not shown),
suggesting an accelerated cancer progression in the 250 mg/kg
group. Carcass examination revealed that the 250 mg/kg dose
resulted in a 70% incidence of pelvis LN metastasis in TRAMP-FVB
mice with poorly differentiated cancer as opposed to 0% (no
enlarged LNs) and 10% of TRAMP-FVB mice in the 0 and 1,000 mg/
kg diet groups (Fig. 1B); representative photographs of three LNs
from three TRAMP-FVB mice consuming 250 mg/kg diet are shown
alongside three LNs from control TRAMP-FVB mice for comparison
(Fig. 1C). LN sections from the 250 mg/kg diet group revealed
consistent SV40-Tag expression showing that metastasizing prostatic cells underlie LN enlargement (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Dietary genistein differentially regulates OPN expression
depending on exposure time in TRAMP-FVB mice. With this
work in progress, Mentor-Marcel and colleagues (18) reported OPN
reduction as a possible mechanism by which genistein reduces CaP
metastasis and increases TRAMP survival. To determine its
possible involvement in genistein-induced metastasis, we examined
OPN expression in CaP progression of TRAMP-FVB mice on a
regular diet at 5, 9, 18, and 24 weeks of age. OPN levels were barely

detectable at 5 weeks at mRNA and protein levels. By 9 weeks,
levels increased by 2-fold and continued to increase up to 10-fold
by 24 weeks (Fig. 2A). We then examined OPN levels in the
prostates of TRAMP-FVB mice consuming genistein at 4 or
12 weeks of age. Mice consuming 250 and 1,000 mg/kg diets from
4 to 20 weeks of age (prevention regimen) displayed a dosedependent reduction in OPN mRNA and protein expression (f2-

fold in the 1,000 mg/kg group; Fig. 2B), corroborating abovementioned study (18). Alternatively, prostates of mice consuming
250 and 1,000 mg/kg from 12 to 20 weeks of age (intervention
regimen) displayed an increase (f2.5-fold) in OPN (mRNA and
protein levels) in the 250 mg/kg group, whereas in 1,000 mg/kg
group, OPN levels were not significantly altered, statistically, with
only a single mouse showing elevated OPN, comparable with
250 mg/kg group levels and coinciding with LN metastasis (Fig. 2B;
data not shown). LNs derived from TRAMP-FVB mice consuming
250 mg/kg genistein from 12 to 20 weeks of age expressed OPN
(Fig. 2C), as opposed to lymphatic vessels from control TRAMPFVB mice that did not (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Genistein biphasically regulates PC3 cell proliferation and
invasion in vitro. To delineate whether the genistein-induced
metastasis in TRAMP-FVB is an inherent characteristic of the
model or a consistent biphasic effect of genistein at low versus
high concentrations, human PC3 cells were treated with various
concentrations of genistein [0, 500, and 1,000 nmol/L representing physiologically achievable concentrations in vivo (12) and
50,000 nmol/L (pharmacologic dose)] for 72 hours and counted. We
observed a biphasic effect of genistein on PC3 proliferation; 500 to
1,000 nmol/L induced a significant 1.5-fold increase in cell number,
as opposed to >3.0-fold decrease with 50,000 nmol/L genistein,
compared with vehicle-treated cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 3A).
Similarly treated cells were subjected to the Boyden chamber
with Matrigel assay with 10% FBS medium as a chemoattractant
for 24 hours to assess invasion. A 2.0-fold increase in invaded cell
number was observed with 500 nmol/L genistein compared with
vehicle (P < 0.01), whereas 50,000 nmol/L genistein reduced
invasion by 2.0-fold (P < 0.05; Fig. 3B). The 1,000 nmol/L dose failed
to significantly increase invasion (Fig. 3B). Representative photographs of filters with toluidine blue–stained invading cells are
shown (Fig. 3B, bottom). Zymography analysis of conditioned
medium from these samples revealed that genistein (500 and
1,000 nmol/L) induced a f2.0-fold increase in active MMP-9
compared with vehicle, whereas 50,000 nmol/L decreased MMP-9
activity >2-fold (P < 0.01; Fig. 3C).
Physiologically achievable doses of genistein increase OPN
levels that are necessary for up-regulation of proliferation and
invasion of PC3 cells. To examine whether PC3 cells recapitulate
the effects of genistein on OPN, expression and secreted levels of
OPN in PC3 cells treated with 0, 500, 1,000, and 50,000 nmol/L of
genistein for 72 hours were examined. Genistein (500 nmol/L)
resulted in a 2.0-fold increase in OPN protein expression (Fig. 4A)
as well as secretion as detected by ELISA (Supplementary Fig. S3).
To determine the requirement for OPN in the genistein-induced
increase in proliferation and invasion, scrambled and OPN shRNA
stable cell lines were established via retroviral infection. The OPN
shRNA stable cell line had undetectable OPN levels, which were not
altered by genistein (Fig. 4A, bottom; Supplementary Fig. S4).
An equal number of OPN shRNA–expressing and scrambled
shRNA–expressing cells were seeded and treated F genistein
(500 nmol/L) for 72 hours, living cell number was recorded, and
60,000 cells/cell type or treatment were transferred to the Boyden
chamber with Matrigel and allowed to invade for 24 hours.
Genistein treatment (500 nmol/L) resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in
the number of scrambled shRNA–expressing cells (Fig. 4B),
recapitulating the effect of genistein on paternal PC3 cells. Basal
proliferation of OPN shRNA–expressing cells was reduced compared with scrambled shRNA cells by f35%, and genistein induced
a 1.16-fold induction of proliferation compared with vehicle

(Fig. 4B), suggesting that OPN induction by genistein contributes to
the proliferation increase. Knockdown of OPN also resulted in a
75% reduction of invasion compared with scrambled shRNA cells,
and genistein (500 nmol/L) resulted in a f1.4-fold increase in
invasion compared with vehicle-treated OPN shRNA cells, which is
significantly lower than the 2-fold increase observed in the
genistein-treated scrambled shRNA cells (Fig. 4C). OPN knockdown
also resulted in a 70% reduction in MMP-9 activity (P < 0.001),
which was no longer inducible by genistein (500 nmol/L; Fig. 4D).
These results suggest that OPN not only contributes to basal PC3

invasion but that its induction is one of the mechanisms mediating
the genistein-induced invasion.
Induction of OPN, proliferation, and invasion by genistein
in PC3 cells are estrogen and PI3K dependent. OPN expression
and activity are regulated by estrogen and PI3K signaling (19). The
ability of genistein to modulate these pathways was examined.
PC3 cells were transfected with ERE-TATA-luciferase and treated
F 500 nmol/L genistein. Genistein induced >1.6-fold increase in
luciferase activity compared with vehicle-treated transfected cells
(Fig. 5A). Induction was abolished by addition of ICI 182,780, an

ER antagonist. Due to low induction levels of ERE-TATA-luciferase
by genistein, we examined its modulation by estradiol in PC3 cells.
Estradiol (5 pmol/L) induced a 1.5-fold increase in luciferase
activity relative to control in PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A)
compared with >8-fold induction in the estrogen-responsive breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 (Supplementary Fig. S5B), suggesting that
genistein exerts estrogenic activity in PC3 cells similar to estradiol.
Genistein (500 nmol/L) induced a significant 2.0-fold increase in
pAkt (S473) as opposed to a 2.0-fold reduction by 50,000 nmol/L
(Fig. 5B, top left), with no effect on total Akt. Interestingly, prostatic
lysates from TRAMP-FVB mice consuming genistein-supplemented
diets also showed a biphasic pAkt regulation with a significant
2-fold up-regulation in the 250 mg/kg diet group and a slight
nonsignificant decrease in the 1,000 mg/kg diet compared with
control (Fig. 5B, top right). Inhibition of estrogen and PI3K
signaling in vitro (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S6) abolished OPN
induction by genistein in the presence of ICI 182,780 and
wortmannin, respectively (Fig. 5C, top and middle). Although PC3
proliferation was not significantly affected by ICI 182,780 alone, the
increase in proliferation by genistein (500 nmol/L) was abolished in
its presence, showing that estrogen signaling is necessary for the
proliferation increase by genistein (Fig. 5D, top). The significant
ability of genistein to increase PC3 invasion was also mitigated in
the presence of ICI 182,780 and was decreased from 2.1- to 1.18-fold
(Fig. 5D, top). About PI3K signaling, a significant 2.0-fold reduction
in PC3 cell number was observed in the presence of wortmannin
alone (Fig. 5D, top). Moreover, wortmannin eliminated the 1.5-fold
induction in cell number by genistein, suggesting that PI3K and/or
Akt activation is needed for both basal and genistein-induced
increase in PC3 proliferation. Wortmannin alone induced a 2.0-fold
decrease in invasion compared with vehicle (Fig. 5D, top). Addition
of genistein (500 nmol/L) in the presence of wortmannin not only
failed to increase invasion but further reduced invading cell
numbers, suggesting that PI3K activity is necessary for the

www.aacrjournals.org

genistein-induced invasion increase but also that low genistein
doses might inhibit cell invasion in the absence of PI3K activity.
Zymography revealed that genistein (500 nmol/L) failed to induce
MMP-9 activity in the presence of ICI 182,780 or wortmannin in
PC3 cells (Fig. 5D, bottom), suggesting MMP-9 as a possible
mediator of the estrogen- and PI3K-dependent effects of genistein
on PC3 cells.

Discussion
In this study, we showed that consumption of low genistein
doses (250 mg/kg diet) accelerates CaP progression in TRAMP-FVB
mice when consumed after PIN initiation. This phenotype was
characterized by Akt activation, OPN up-regulation, and occurrence of pelvic LN metastases. Furthermore, the previously
established chemopreventive dose (1,000 mg/kg diet; ref. 12) lost
its efficacy when consumed at 12 weeks of age. To delineate the
mechanisms underlying these observations, in vitro studies using
PC3 cells treated with physiologic versus pharmacologic genistein
doses recapitulated the proliferation and invasion increases
observed in vivo. These increases were dependent on OPN upregulation and required active estrogen and PI3K signaling,
involving MMP-9 activation. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report documenting an increase in metastasis by genistein
in the TRAMP-FVB model while pinpointing an estrogen- and
PI3K-dependent induction of OPN as a necessary mechanism.
Considered potentially chemopreventive, increased usage of soy
products prompted the examination of effects of physiologically
achievable concentrations of genistein on breast and uterine cancer
cell lines and animal models (20). At low doses (<10 Amol/L),
genistein stimulates the growth of estrogen-sensitive cell lines
(21–23) while decreasing proliferation at higher doses (>10–
20 Amol/L; refs. 22, 23). This suggests that genistein exerts a
biphasic effect on growth and proliferation of cancer cells,

similarly to what we have observed in prostate tumors of TRAMPFVB mice and human PC3 cells, with low nanomolar concentrations inducing growth (14) and metastasis of prostate tumor
cells when treatment started after PIN in vivo as well as proliferation and invasion in vitro, and a higher dose (50,000 nmol/L)
reducing proliferation and invasion.
Increased tumor growth, metastasis, and OPN up-regulation
were not seen when genistein is consumed (same dose) by 4-weekold, tumor-free TRAMP-FVB mice or 12-week-old nontransgenic
C57BL/6FVB mice (12),1 suggesting a dependence on exposure
time or tumor presence and is not an inherent issue in the model
used.
OPN expression concomitant with pelvic LN metastases in
TRAMP-FVB mice and proliferation/invasion induction in PC3
cells by low genistein doses is significant in the context of CaP
metastasis. CaP cells preferentially metastasize to bone, a process
facilitated by OPN in various ways (24, 25). Here, we present data
with reference to LN metastasis as opposed to bone because the
former occurs more frequently in the TRAMP model with 100%
incidence in mice over 28 weeks as opposed to 25% incidence of

bone metastases in 32-week-old TRAMP mice (26, 27), and LN
metastases were the most striking observation upon mice
dissection. Interestingly, OPN expression has been correlated with
LN metastases in a variety of cancers (28–31). However, the
possibility that bone metastasis occurs on OPN induction by
genistein in other models of CaP or humans cannot be eliminated.
We have observed OPN increases as early as 9 weeks of age,
coinciding with PIN initiation and a highly proliferative stage (12)
in TRAMP-FVB mice, suggesting a role in proliferation. In fact, OPN
induction promoted tumor growth, and its knockdown reduced
Ras-transformed 3T3 cell growth in soft agar and animal implants
(32). This is also confirmed by the decreased proliferation of
PC3(OPN ) cells. Importantly, PC3 proliferation and invasion were
no longer enhanced by genistein (500 nmol/L) to the same extent
in PC3(OPN ) cells, indicating that OPN and/or its downstream
effectors mediate at least the stimulatory part of the proposed
biphasic genistein effect.
MMP-9 activity was also increased by low genistein doses (500
and 1,000 nmol/L). Interestingly, elevated OPN expression correlates with MMP-9 levels (33) and MMP-9 mediates OPN-induced
cell migration and chemoinvasion in B16F10 cells (34). In PC3 cells,
OPN overexpression increases MMP-9 activity (17), presenting
strong evidence that MMP-9 is a downstream effector of OPN in

invasion. Our results agree with these reports in that PC3(OPN )
cells exhibit reduced MMP-9 activity and inhibition of genisteininduced OPN induction by ICI 182,780 or wortmannin abrogated MMP-9 activation by genistein, suggesting that genistein
(500 nmol/L) may stimulate invasion via up-regulation of OPN
and subsequent activation of MMP-9.
The mechanism underlying OPN induction by genistein is
unknown. However, OPN increase was paralleled by an increase
in Akt phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro and was consistently
abrogated in vitro by wortmannin or ICI 182,780. OPN is a
transcriptional target of the ER-related receptor a (35) and is
induced by estradiol in vivo (36). Therefore, OPN induction in

prostates of TRAMP-FVB mice consuming 250 mg/kg genistein
might be of estrogenic nature. OPN is also under the control of the
PI3K pathway and is induced by PTEN deletion in colon cancer,
whereas Ras-induced expression of OPN is PI3K dependent (37),
which agrees with our wortmannin studies.
Estrogen sensitivity of cell lines/models used seems to determine
the growth and metastasis-promoting effects of genistein. Studies
reporting proliferation increase by genistein in estrogen-responsive
cell lines have failed to observe similar effects in ER-negative cells
(38). Consumption of 250 mg/kg diet before orthotopic implantation of PC3-M, a metastatic subline of PC3 lacking ERs (39),
decreased lung metastases (40), whereas LN weights increased in

genistein-treated mice harboring PC3 xenografts (41). Our study
agrees with these observations in that TRAMP-FVB prostates1
and PC3 cells express ERa and ERh (39). The need for estrogen
signaling was also highlighted by the administration of ICI 182,780,
which reduced the induction of proliferation and invasion by
genistein. However, the importance of estrogen signaling on the
in vivo effects of genistein remains to be determined.
We and others have pinpointed Akt inhibition by genistein as
one mechanism by which genistein exerts its chemopreventive
actions (12, 42). Recently, an increase in Akt phosphorylation by
10 Amol/L genistein was reported in porcine aortic endothelial
cells in vivo (43). Although not made in a tumor cell setting, this
observation agrees with our findings about Akt activation by
genistein in vitro and in vivo.
We have also observed that PI3K inhibition by wortmannin
abrogated the proliferation and invasion increase by genistein,
suggesting that genistein acts in a PI3K-dependent manner in PC3
cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects on invasion by nanomolar
doses of genistein in the absence of PI3K activity suggest that there
might be a balance between inhibitory and activating effects of
genistein, with the balance shifted toward inhibition upon PI3K
inactivation. Experiments are under way to determine whether
PI3K/Akt and estrogen signaling activation by genistein are
independent events or an interaction between both pathways.
The inhibition of metastasis by genistein in a chemopreventive
setting has been reported extensively (44). However, genistein
increased the size of LN metastases but not tumor size when
administered to PC3/nude mouse xenograft model (41), postulating
that LN metastasis increase is due to the antiangiogenic effects of
genistein and subsequent hypoxia. However, in our study, genistein
resulted in increased tumor size and metastasis, suggesting a direct
effect on tumor cell proliferation when administered to TRAMPFVB mice with PIN lesions. Furthermore, proliferation and invasion

were potentiated in the same cells used for the xenografts in vitro,
eliminating the hypoxia theory in our model at least.
Recent findings showed that poorly differentiated carcinomas in
the TRAMP-FVB strain are derived from neuroendocrine cells (45).
In this study, 250 mg/kg diet genistein increased the number of
synaptophysin-expressing poorly differentiated carcinomas, which
was also expressed in pelvic LNs (data not shown). One hypothesis
is that a low genistein environment (provided by 250 mg/kg diet)
targets the synaptophysin-expressing neuroendocrine population
in the prostate, resulting in the up-regulation of OPN, the positive
selection of this population (considered highly proliferative and a
candidate for the transit-amplifying population in the prostate;
ref. 46), and emergence of a more aggressive phenotype in this
group. More experiments characterizing the neuroendocrine population in our model, its possible differences at 4 and 12 weeks
of age, and its ER and Akt status would prove/disprove this
hypothesis and further highlight the potential detrimental effects
of low genistein doses.
In this work, we have shown that timing of genistein exposure as
well as the dose used had a major effect on CaP outcome and
progression in TRAMP-FVB mice. This highlights the importance
of examining the effects of physiologically achievable levels of
genistein and its deleterious effects on undiagnosed CaP.
