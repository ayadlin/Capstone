ABSTRACT
Sulforaphane (SFN), a natural compound derived from broccoli/broccoli
sprouts, has been demonstrated to be used as an antitumor agent in different types
of cancers. However, its antitumor effect in thyroid cancer remains largely unknown.
The aim of the study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of SFN for thyroid
cancer and explore the mechanisms underlying antitumor effects of SFN by in vitro
and in vivo studies. Our data demonstrated that SFN significantly inhibited thyroid
cancer cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, induced G2/M
phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and inhibited thyroid cancer cell migration
and invasion by suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and
expression of Slug, Twist, MMP-2 and -9. Mechanically, SFN inhibited thyroid cancer
cell growth and invasiveness through repressing phosphorylation of Akt, enhancing
p21 expression by the activation of Erk and p38 signaling cascades, and promoting
mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent
pathway. Growth of xenograft tumors derived from thyroid cancer cell line FTC133
in nude mice was also significantly inhibited by SFN. Importantly, we did not find
significant effect of SFN on body weight and liver function of mice. Collectively, we
for the first time demonstrate that SFN is a potentially effective antitumor agent
for thyroid cancer.

death rate of thyroid cancer is relatively low and general
prognosis is excellent, 10%–20% of patients with DTC

forms of thyroid cancer either at the initial presentation
or as a recurrence, which is closely correlated with
patient mortality [3, 4].

INTRODUCTION
Thyroid cancer is a common endocrine
malignancy that has rapidly increased in global
incidence in the past 15 years [1, 2]. It is now the fifth
most common cancer in women [2]. Primary thyroid
cancer is classified into three major histopathologic
types [3]: differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs),
including papillary (PTC, 85% of cases) and follicular
(FTC, 5%–10%); medullary thyroid cancer (MTC, 5%);

RESULTS

patients with advanced disease will not respond adequately
to such therapy [5]. Recent advances in understanding the
molecular pathogenesis of thyroid cancer have shown
great promise to develop more effective treatment for
thyroid cancer [3]. This has mainly resulted from the
identification of molecular alterations in major signaling
pathways, such as the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK/ERK
(MAPK) and PI3K/Akt pathways, which play critical
roles in cell transformation, survival and metastasis,
and therefore become classical therapeutical targets for
thyroid cancer [3, 5, 6]. In addition to targeted therapies,
in recent years, some of natural product-derived drugs also
display potent antitumor activity in thyroid cancer, such
as paclitaxel, vincristine, vinorelbine and shikonin [7–10].
Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring
isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables,
especially broccoli. It has been proved to be an important
candidate cancer preventive agent that has high activity
in diverse cancers, including colon cancer [11], bladder
cancer [12], prostate cancer [13, 14], breast cancer [15]
and leukemia [16, 17]. However, its antitumor effect in
thyroid cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we
used a panel of authenticated thyroid cancer cell lines and
primary thyroid cancer cells to test in vitro and in vivo
therapeutic potential of SFN and attempted to explore its
antitumor mechanisms in thyroid cancer.

SFN inhibits thyroid cancer cell proliferation
MTT assay was performed to examine the dose and
time course of the effect of SFN on cell proliferation in
a panel of thyroid cell lines and primary thyroid cancer
cells that were obtained from two different PTC patients.
As shown in Figure 1A, we found that SFN significantly
inhibited cell proliferation in thyroid cancer cell lines in
a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values ranging from
10.8 to 59.6 μM. We attempted to explore the association
of cellular response to SFN with molecular alterations in
the major components of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways
and p53 status. However, we did not find any relationship
(data not shown). In addition, our data demonstrated
that primary cancer cells were also sensitive to SFN,
and IC50 values were 7.6 μM and 19.6 μM, respectively
(Figure 1B). Next, we analyzed time-dependent response
of thyroid cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells to
SFN. As shown in Figure 1C, SFN significantly inhibited
proliferation of FTC133, 8305C, BCPAP and K1 cells at
the indicated concentrations and time points. Similarly,
SFN also significantly inhibited proliferation of primary
cancer cells at the indicated concentrations and time points
(Figure 1D).

peak at 24 h in FTC133 cells and at 12 h in K1 cells,
respectively, and then decreased continuously as compared
to the controls (Supplementary Figure S1). Next, ROS
scavenger, N-acetylcystein (NAC), was used to explore
the role of ROS-induced by SFN in growth inhibitory
of thyroid cancer cells. As expected, 20 mM NAC
dramatically decreased SFN-induced ROS production
(Figure 3A), and significantly blocked cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis induced by SFN in both FTC133 and K1 cells
(Supplementary Figure S2). As a result, anti-proliferative
effect of SFN was almost completely abolished by NAC in
these two cells (Figure 3B). To further determine the role
of ROS in SFN-mediated growth inhibitory, we selected
another ROS scavenger, ascorbate (ASC), to treat FTC133
and K1 cells. Like NAC, ASC treatment significantly
attenuated anti-proliferative effect of SFN in these two
cell lines (Supplementary Figure S3).
Given that loss of MMP is a hallmark of apoptosis,
representing an early event coinciding with caspase
activation [18], in this study, mitochondrial probe 5,5′,
6,6′-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-Tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-Carbo­
cyanine iodide (JC-1) was used to test the effect of SFN
on MMP in FTC133 and K1 cells. In non-apoptotic cells,
JC-1 exists as dimer and accumulates as aggregate in the
mitochondria, which appears red. Whereas, in apoptotic
and necrotic cells, JC-1 exists in a monomeric form and
stains the cytosol green. Typical FL-1/FL-2 dot plots for
JC-1-stained FTC133 cells were exhibited in Figure 3C
(upper panels). The green fluorescing monomers shown
in the lower region represented apoptotic cells. As shown
in Figure 3C (lower panel), cells exposed to SFN at the
indicated concentrations exhibited a dose-dependent
decrease in JC-1 staining as compared to control cells,
indicating loss of MMP in SFN-treated cells. Similarly, we
also found that the effect of SFN on MMP could be almost
completely reversed by NAC (Figure 3D). Collectively,
loss of MMP induced by ROS may act as an important
mediator of SFN-induced cell death in thyroid cancer
cells.

Given that growth inhibitory of cancer cell is usually
associated with cell cycle arrest, we thus examined the
effect of SFN on cell cycle in thyroid cancer cells. As
shown in Figure 2A, as compared with controls, cell cycle
was arrested at the G2/M phase when FTC133, 8305C,
BCPAP and K1 cells were treated with the indicated doses
of SFN for 24 h. The percentage of G2/M phase was
increased from 19.9 ± 1.7% to 30.7 ± 0.7% in FTC133
cells, from 21.3 ± 0.8% to 37.3 ± 1.3% in 8305C cells,
from 10.5 ± 0.7% to 30.9 ± 2.4% in BCPAP cells and
from 8.9 ± 0.2% to 16.2 ± 1.2% in K1 cells, respectively
(Figure 2A, lower panel). To explore the mechanism
underlying SFN-mediated G2/M arrest, we investigated
the effect of SFN on the expression of cell cycle-related
genes in these four cell lines, including Cdk1, Cdk2,
CyclinB1, Cdc25C, Chk1 and p21. As shown in Figure 2B,
SFN treatment at the indicated concentrations caused
a decreased expression of Cdk1, Cdk2, CyclinB1 and
Cdc25C in all cell lines, whereas Chk1 expression in
FTC133 and 8305c cells and p21 expression in all cell
lines were increased by SFN treatment.
Next, we tested the effect of SFN on thyroid
cancer cell apoptosis. As shown in Figure 2C, FTC133,
8305C, BCPAP and K1 cells treated with the indicated
concentrations of SFN at the indicated time point showed
a dramatic increase in both early and late apoptosis
as compared with controls, and this effect was dosedependent. Induction of apoptosis was further confirmed
by detecting the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in
FTC133 and K1 cells. As shown in Figure 2D, 40 μM SFN
enhanced the protein levels of the active form of caspase-3
and -9, and decreased the protein levels of procaspase-3
and -9 in a time-dependent manner in these two cell lines.

cancer cells

SFN inhibits thyroid cancer cell migration and
invasion

It is well documented that cell death induced by
some antitumor agents is associated with ROS generation
and the perturbation of mitochondrial functions, including
SFN [14, 15]. Thus, we performed DCF staining assay to
analyze ROS production induced by SFN in this study. As
shown in Figure 3A, as compared with controls, ROS was
significantly induced in both FTC133 and K1 cells when
cells were treated with 40 μM SFN for 4 h. The mean
fluorescence intensity was increased from 339.0 ± 2.7 to
446.7 ± 3.5 (P < 0.001) in FTC133 cells and from 169.7
± 1.5 to 212.0 ± 1.7 (P < 0.001) in K1 cells. Moreover,
we further measured ROS levels in FTC133 and K1 cells
treated with SFN for 12 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively.
The result showed that ROS production reached to the

The inhibitory effect of SFN on cell migration and
invasive ability was determined by the transwell assay.
As showed in Figure 4A, as compared with controls,
there were a significantly lower number of migrated cells
in FTC133, 8305C, BCPAP and K1 cells treated SFN
at the indicated concentrations, respectively. Similarly,
the Matrigel assays showed that SFN at the indicated
concentrations significantly inhibited the invasive
potential of thyroid cancer cells (Figure 4B). Notably,
inhibition of thyroid cancer cell migration and invasion
by SFN was a dose-dependent manner. To clarify the
related mechanisms, we tested the effect of SFN on
expression of metastasis-related genes in these cell

be link to inhibition of expression of metastasis-related
genes and EMT process by SFN.
Next, we attempted to test whether ROS was
involved in thyroid cancer cell migration and invasion. As
shown in Figure 5A and 5B, the inhibiting effects of SFN
on migration and invasion were completely abolished by
NAC in these two cell lines. Moreover, NAC treatment
significantly decreased E-cadherin expression induced
by SFN in these cell lines (Figure 5C). These findings
further support the role of ROS in thyroid cancer cell

cancer [3]. As shown in Figure 6A, SFN significantly
inhibited phosphorylation of Akt in a dose-dependent
manner in both FTC133 and K1 cells. Moreover, we
found that SFN enhanced phosphorylation of Erk and
p38 in these two cell lines, and promoting effect of
SFN on phosphorylation of p38 was dose-dependent.
However, we did not find the effect of SFN on
phosphorylation of JNK (Figure 6A). Given that tumor
suppressor p53 plays a central role in the regulation of
cell cycle and apoptosis, we thus investigated the effect
of SFN on p53 activity in these two cell lines. We did
not find the effect of SFN on the accumulation of p53
protein in both FTC133 and K1 cells harboring mutanttype and wild-type p53, respectively (Figure  6A).
However, our data showed that the expression of its
downstream target gene p21 was increased by SFN
in thyroid cancer cells (Figure 2B), suggesting that
SFN enhances p21 expression by a p53-independent
pathway. This is supported by a previous study that
elevation of ROS has been demonstrated to result
in p53-independent accumulation of p21 through
enhancing the activity of Erk and p38 [19].

Next, we attempted to determine the role of ROS
in the modulation of these signaling pathways in FTC133
and K1 cells. As expected, combination of SFN and
NAC at the indicated concentrations remarkably restored
phosphorylation of Akt and inhibited phosphorylation
of Erk and p38 as compared with SFN treatment alone
in both FTC133 and K1 cells (Figure 6B). Accordingly,
our data demonstrated that NAC dramatically inhibited
SFN-induced p21 expression in these two cell lines
(Figure 6C). Taken together, our data are consistent with a
model (Figure 6D) in which SFN contributes to inhibition
of thyroid cancer cell growth and metastasis through
repressing the activity of PI3K/Akt cascade and expression
of MMP-2 and -9, increasing p21 expression by activation
of MAPK/Erk and MAPK/p38 signaling pathways, and
promoting mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis via a ROSdependent mechanism.

in both SFN-treated and control mice (data not shown).
In addition, there was no significant difference in serum
AST and ALT levels between SFN-treated and control
mice (Figure 7E). These observations implicate that the
indicated dose of SFN did not cause significant liver injury
in mice, supporting that it may be a safe and effective
agent for thyroid cancer therapy at least in xenograft
tumor models.

DISCUSSION
SFN, a dietary isothiocyanate found in broccoli
and cauliflower, has been widely used for treatment of
inflammatory diseases and recent studies have indicated
its antitumor effects in cell lines and animals [14, 15,
20, 21]. Notably, a placebo-controlled, double-blind,
randomized clinical study of sprout extracts containing
either glucosinolates (principally the precursor of SFN)
or isothiocyanates (principally SFN) was conducted on
healthy volunteers in a previous study [22]. No significant
or consistent subjective or objective abnormal events
(toxicities) were observed, suggesting SFN is safe for
human being. In addition, although a very recent phase II
study showed that treatment of 200 μmoles/day of SFNrich extracts did not lead to ≥ 50% PSA declines in the
majority of recurrent prostate cancer patients, because of
the safety of treatment and the effects on modulation of
PSA doubling time, further studies, including those with
higher dose, may be warranted to determine the role of
SFN as a prevention agent or treatment agent [23]. These
observations support SFN as a potential antitumor agent
for cancer treatment. However, its antitumor effect in
thyroid cancer remains largely unclear. In this study, we
demonstrated that SFN markedly inhibited thyroid cancer
cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and thyroid cancer cell
migration and invasion.
Although the current evidences have highlighted the
potent antitumor effect of SFN on thyroid cancer, the exact
mechanism is still unclear. Our data showed that SFN-treated
thyroid cancer cells were arrested in G2/M phase, which
was accompanied by a decline in the levels of Cdk1, Cdk2,
Cyclin B1 and Cdc25C and an increase in the levels of Chk1
and p21. ROS scavenger NAC efficiently abolished SFNinduced G2/M phase cell arrest and inhibited p21 expression
in thyroid cancer cells. It is well-documented that p53 is an
important molecular target in cancer biology because it plays
a central role in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis.
Several studies have demonstrated that SFN induces a
positive effect on p53 expression with a consequent increase
in Bax and decrease in Bcl-2 [24, 25], whereas there are also
some studies to show that there is no participation of p53 or
that it is not required for the SFN activity [26, 27]. In this
study, we did not find the effect of SFN on the expression of
p53 protein in either p53 mutant-type FTC133 cells or p53
wild-type K1 cells. Collectively, these observations suggest
that SFN up-regulates p21 expression in these two cell lines

SFN inhibits xenograft tumor growth
Given in vitro inhibitory effect of SFN on thyroid
cancer cell growth, we next determined the effect of
SFN on the growth of xenograft thyroid tumors in nude
mice. As shown in Figure 7A (upper panel), FTC133 cellderived xenograft tumors progressively grew in the control
mice, whereas tumors grew slowly in the mice treated with
SFN at the indicated dose. Tumor volume was significantly
lower in SFN-treated mice as compared to control mice
(P < 0.001). However, body weight, an indicator of the
health of the animals, did not show a significant difference
between these two groups throughout the experiments
(Figure 7A, lower panel). At the end of experiments, the
tumors were isolated and weighted. As shown in Figure
7B, the mean tumor weight was significantly less in SFNtreated mice as compared with control mice (P < 0.01). To
further confirm the regulation of major pathways by SFN,
tumors tissues from mice were homogenated, lysed, and
then subjected to western blotting using specific primary
antibodies, including p-Akt, total-Akt (t-Akt), p-Erk,
total-Erk (t-Erk), p-p38, total-p38 (t-p38) and active
caspase-9 and E-cadherin. Similar to in vitro study, SFN
inhibited the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway, and activated
the MAPK/Erk and MAPK/p38 pathways (Figure 7C).
As expected, SFN similarly enhanced the protein levels
of the active form of caspase-9 and increased E-cadherin
expression (Figure 7C).
To quantitatively evaluate the proliferation index of
tumors treated with SFN, tumor sections were stained with
the Ki-67 antibody. As shown in Figure 7D, treatment with
SFN significantly decreased the number of Ki-67-positive
cells in tumor as compared with controls (P < 0.05). More
importantly, histopathological evidences demonstrated
that hepatic tissues exhibited normal large polygonal cells
with prominent round nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm,
and few spaced hepatic sinusoids arranged in-between

by a p53-independent mechanism and SFN causes G2/M
phase arrest by a ROS-dependent pathway, as supported by
the previous studies that elevation of ROS in cancer cells
caused accumulation of p21, an increase in expression of
Chk1 and decrease in Cdc25C through different mechanisms
including activation of Erk and p38 signaling pathways
[19, 28, 29]. Accordingly, our data demonstrated that SFN
enhanced phosphorylation of Erk and p38 in FTC133 and
K1 cells, and the elimination of ROS by NAC efficiently
inhibited phosphorylation of Erk and p38.
Several previous studies have shown that SFN
induces ROS production, resulting in apoptosis in different
types of cancers. Usually, this process is accompanied
by the disruption of mitochondria membrane potential
(MMP) [26, 30, 31]. It is well-known that apoptosis
can be initiated in two ways: one is the “intrinsic
pathway” mediated by the mitochondria, and the other
is the “extrinsic pathway” mediated by death receptors.
Mitochondria are the major generators of ATP by
oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis occurs in response to a wide range of stimuli.
Mitochondria are also the major source of ROS generation
and damaged mitochondria can release more ROS. ROS
can cause MMP disruption by activating mitochondrial
permeability transition, and induce apoptosis by releasing
apoptogenic protein such as cytochrome c to cytosol [32,
33]. In the cytosol, cytochrome c can activate caspase-9,
and activated caspase-9 in turn cleaves and activates
executioner caspase-3. After caspase-3 activation, some
specific substrates for caspase-3 such as poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) are cleaved, and eventually lead to
apoptosis [34]. To explore the mechanism underlying
induction of cell apoptosis by SFN in thyroid cancer cells,
we tested the effect of SFN on intracellular ROS levels
and MMP. As expected, our data demonstrated that SFN
caused the activation of caspase-3 and -9 in thyroid cancer
cells through inducing ROS generation accompanied by
the loss of MMP, ultimately contributing to cell apoptosis.
NAC efficiently abolish growth inhibitory and the
disruption of MMP induced by SFN, suggesting that SFNinduced ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction
may be a major cause of cell death in thyroid cancer cells.
Given that tumor metastasis is the major cause
of cancer-related death, we tested the effect of SFN on
cell invasiveness in this study. Our data showed that
SFN increased expression of E-cadherin, and decreased
expression of Vimentin and E-cadherin transcriptional
repressors Slug and Twist, contributing to inhibition of
EMT process. This oncogenic process can be regulated
by multiple signaling cascades among which PI3K/Akt
cascade is the primary one [35–37]. It was consistent
with our finding that SFN dramatically inhibited the
activity of PI3K/Akt pathway in thyroid cancer cells by
a ROS-dependent mechanism. As expected, our data
demonstrated that NAC efficiently abolish the inhibition
of migration and invasion by SFN, and induction of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

E-cadherin expression by SFN in thyroid cancer cells.
Notably, a previous study has reported that NAC can not
only remove ROS, but also inhibit the activity of mTOR
pathway [38]. However, in this study, we did not find
such effect, suggesting that NAC just plays a role as ROS
scavenger in the present study. In addition, considering
that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a critical
role in tumor metastasis [39], we investigated the effect
of SFN on expression of MMP-2 and -9 in thyroid cancer
cells. Our data showed that SFN significantly inhibited
expression of these two genes, suggesting that the decrease
in the metastasis-associated phenotypes may be mediated
at least in part by down-regulation of MMP-2 and -9.
Until now, numerous molecular mechanisms
underlying antitumor activity of SFN have been proposed
such as activation of pro-apoptotic genes such as caspase
[40], blockage of tubulin polymerization [15], induction
of oxidative stress [12, 13], activation of NF-κB, ERK and
JNK signaling pathways [11, 14]. In recent years, it is well
known that SFN inhibits the activity of histone deacetylase
(HDAC), as a new mechanism underlying its pro-apoptotic
effect [41, 42]. In the present study, we have shown that
SFN inhibits thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration
and invasion, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
through a ROS-dependent pathway. Furthermore, SFN
may have a particularly high clinical potential for thyroid
cancer treatment, as supported by its profound inhibitory
effect on the proliferation of primary thyroid cancer
cells and the growth of xenograft thyroid tumors without
significant liver injury, implicating that SFN is a safe and
effective antitumor agent for thyroid cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human thyroid cancer cell lines and primary
thyroid cancer cells
Human thyroid cancer cell lines 8305C, IHH4,
FTC133, BCPAP, TPC1 and K1 were from Dr. Haixia Guan

Hospital, Shanghai, P. R. China). BCPAP, TPC-1 and K1
were derived from PTC. FTC133 was derived from FTC.
8305C, C643 and IHH4 were derived from ATC. These
cell lines were all routinely cultured at 37°C in RPMI 1640
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), except for
FTC133 that was cultured in DMEM/Ham’s F-12 medium
(Invitrogen Technologies, Inc., CA). For human primary
thyroid cancer cell culturing, tumor tissues were dissected
from thyroidectomy specimens. None of the patients had
received prior chemical, hormonal, or radiation therapy.
Histological assessment was performed by an experienced
pathologist based on World Health Organization (WHO)
criteria. The third passages were used for primary cell growth
assays. Culture medium was DMEM/Ham’s F-12 medium

1IU/L bovine TSH (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., MO), 10 mg/L
bovine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., MO), and 5mg/L human
transferrin (Gibco-BRL, Life Technologies, NY).
In some experiments, cells were treated with
sulforaphane (SFN) and ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) or ascorbate (ASC) each alone or in combination
as the indicated concentrations and time, and medium and
agent were replenished every 24 h. SFN was purchased
from LKT Laboratories. Inc. (St. Paul). NAC and ASC were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (Saint Louis, MO), and
dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and Tris-HCl (pH
7.4), respectively, aliquoted and stored at –80°C until use.
The same volume of vehicle was used as control.

was converted to cDNA using PrimeScript RT reagent
Kit (Takara Inc., Dalian, P.R. China) according to the
instructions of the manufacturer. RT-qPCR was performed
to evaluate expression of the indicated genes on a CFX96
real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., CA),
using SYBR Premix ExTaq II (Takara Inc., Dalian, P.R.
China) with 18S rRNA cDNA as endogenous control. The
primer sequences are presented in Supplementary Table S1.
Each sample was run in triplicate.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing
protease inhibitors. Cellular proteins were collected
and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto
PVDF membranes (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany). The membranes were then incubated with
the indicated primary antibodies. Anti-caspase-3
(H-277) and caspase-9 (96.1.23) were purchased from Santa
Cruz. Anti-E-cadherin and anti-Vimentin were purchased
from Epitomics, Inc. Anti-phospho-AktSer473 (p-Akt), antitotal-Akt (t-Akt), anti-phospho-Erk (p-Erk) and anti-totalErk (t-Erk) were purchased from Bioworld Technology.
Anti-phospho-p38 (p-p38) and anti-total-p38 (t-p38)
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. AntiJNK1+JNK2+ JNK3 (phospho T183+T183+T221) antibody
was purchased from Abcam. Anti-p53 was purchased from
ZSGB-Bio. Anti-GAPDH was purchased from Abmart.
This was followed by incubation with species-specific
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies from ZSGB-BIO,
and antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the
Western Bright ECL detection system (Advansta, CA).

Cell proliferation assay
Cells (3000/well) were seeded into 96-well plates
and cultured with different concentrations of SFN for 72 h.
3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay was used to evaluate cell
proliferation. IC50 values were calculated by using the
Reed-Muench method [43]. After SFN treatment at the
indicated times, cell culture was added with 10 μl of
5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) and incubated for
4 h, followed by addition of 150 μl of DMSO for 15-min.
The plates were then read on a microplate reader using a test
wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 670
nm. Three triplicates were done to determine each data point.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were serum starved for 12 h. After co-culture with
the indicated doses of SFN and/or NAC for 24 h, cells were
harvested, washed twice in PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol on
ice for at least 30 min. Cells were then stained with propidium
iodide (PI) solution (50 μg/ml PI, 50 μg/ml RNase A, 0.1%
Triton-X, 0.1mM EDTA). Cell cycles were analyzed based on
DNA contents using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, NJ).

Detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
Generation of ROS was measured by the oxidationsensitive fluorescent probe Dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA) as previously described [44].
Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were treated with 40 μM SFN
and/or 20 mM NAC for 4 h. Cells were then harvested,
washed, and suspended in serum-free medium containing
10 μM of DCFH-DA at 37°C for 30 min in the dark. Cells
were subsequently washed and resuspended in PBS, and
analyzed by flow cytometer.
JC-1 is a kind of ideal fluorescent probe widely
used in the detection of mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP). Following cells treated with 40 μM SFN and/
or 20 mM NAC for 4 h, JC-1 were added to the culture
medium (500 μl/well) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min
in the dark for mitochondrial staining. After washing
twice with cold dyeing buffer to remove unbound dye,
resuspended in dyeing buffer and inspected by fluorescence
microscopy. Quantification by flow cytometry detected
mitochondria containing red JC-1 aggregates in the FL2
channel and green JC-1 monomers in the FL1 channel.

Apoptosis assay
Cells (4 × 105/ well) were plated into 6-well plates.
After 24 h-incubation, cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of SFN and/ or NAC. After 12 h-, 24 h- and
36 h-incubation, cells were harvested, washed with PBS,
and subjected to sequential staining with Annexin V-FITC/
PI Apoptosis Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science) by
two-color flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, NJ), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Each experiment was
performed in triplicate.

Cell migration and invasion assays

Statistical analysis

Cell migration and invasion assay was performed
using Transwell chambers (8.0 μm pore size; Millipore,
MA). It was noted that, for cell invasion assay, the
chambers were coated with 24 μg/μl of Matrigel (BD
Bioscience, NJ) in 24-well plates. Cells (1 × 104/well)
were seeded in the upper chamber in 400 μl of medium
containing 0.5% FBS and the indicated concentrations of
SFN or vehicle control. Medium with 10% FBS (600 μl)
was added to the lower chamber. Following a 24
h-incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2, non-migrating and
non-invading cells in the upper chamber were removed
with a cotton swab, migrating and invading cells
were fixed in 100% methanol and stained with 0.5%
crystal violet in 2% ethanol. Photographs were taken
randomly for at least five fields of each membrane using
a microscope. The number of migrating or invading
cells was expressed as the average number of cells per
microscopic field over five fields. All assays were run
in triplicate.

Data were compared using the t test (SPSS statistical
package 16.0, Chicago, IL). A P < 0.05 was considered to
be statistically significant. All values were expressed as
the mean ± SD. Unless indicated, data shown in the figures
are representatives.

Female athymic nude mice were purchased from
SLAC laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, PR.
China) and housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF)
environment. Thyroid cancer cells FTC133 (3 × 106)
were injected s.c. into flanks of mice at the age of 5 wk.
When tumors grew to ~5 mm in diameter, mice were
grouped into two groups (five mice per group). Two
groups were treated with vehicle control or 50 mg/kg
SFN through i.p. injection every 2 days, respectively.
Tumor volumes were measured at the start of the
treatment every 2 days during the course of the therapy.
Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula (width)2
× length/2. After treatment for 13 days, tumors were
harvested and weighted.
Tumors tissues from representative mice were
homogenated and lysed for western blotting analysis.
The remaining tissues were embedded in paraffin,
sectioned at 4 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E). Cell proliferation ability was assessed by
quantification with Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. Briefly,
anti-human Ki-67 antibody (BD Pharmingen) was 1:150
diluted and immunostaining was done according to a
standard protocol using DAB Substrate Kit (ZSGB-BIO).
Ki-67-positive cells were scored by visual examination
of 5 randomly selected fields of ×200 magnification
containing at least 1000 cells. Moreover, to evaluate
the effect of SFN on hepatocyte damage of animals, we
performed H&E staining of liver sections and detected
serum activities of aspartate transaminase (AST) and
alanine transaminase (ALT) by spectrophotometric
methods as previously described [45].
