Abstract
To disclose the molecular mechanism of bladder cancer, the
second most common genitourinary tumor, we had previously
done genome-wide expression profile analysis of 26 bladder
cancers by means of cDNA microarray representing 27,648
genes. Among genes that were significantly up-regulated in
the majority of bladder cancers, we here report identification
of M-phase phosphoprotein 1 (MPHOSPH1) as a candidate
molecule for drug development for bladder cancer. Northern
blot analyses using mRNAs of normal human organs and
cancer cell lines indicated this molecule to be a novel cancertestis antigen. Introduction of MPHOSPH1 into NIH3T3 cells
significantly enhanced cell growth at in vitro and in vivo
conditions. We subsequently found an interaction between
MPHOSPH1 and protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1),
which was also up-regulated in bladder cancer cells. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed colocalization of endogenous MPHOSPH1 and PRC1 proteins in bladder cancer cells.
Interestingly, knockdown of either MPHOSPH1 or PRC1
expression with specific small interfering RNAs caused a
significant increase of multinuclear cells and subsequent cell
death of bladder cancer cells. Our results imply that the
MPHOSPH1/PRC1 complex is likely to play a crucial role
in bladder carcinogenesis and that inhibition of the
MPHOSPH1/PRC1 expression or their interaction should be
novel therapeutic targets for bladder cancers. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Bladder cancer is the second most common genitourinary
tumor, having an incidence of f357,000 new cases each year
worldwide (1). Approximately one third of them are suspected to
be invasive or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis (1–3).
Although radical cystectomy is considered as the gold standard for
treatment of patients with localized but muscle-invasive bladder
cancer, nearly half of such patients develop metastases within 2
years after cystectomy and subsequently die of the disease.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is usually applied to patients with
muscle-invasive bladder cancer for management of micrometastasis and improvement of their prognosis (4, 5). The MVAC
regimen, a combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin,

and cisplatin, before radical cystectomy has been shown to
improve prognosis of patients, compared with cystectomy alone
(6). Downstaging by neoadjuvant chemotherapy was indicated to
have significant survival benefits (7, 8), and a small subset of
patients may have better quality of life due to preservation of
bladder function. However, because the overall prognosis still
remains very poor (9), development of a new molecular-target
drug(s) for bladder cancer is earnestly desired.
Gene expression profiles obtained by cDNA microarray analysis
have been proved to provide detailed characterization of individual
cancers, and such information should contribute to improve
clinical strategies for neoplastic diseases through development of
novel drugs as well as provide the basis of personalized treatment
(10). Through genome-wide expression analysis, we have isolated a
number of genes that functioned as oncogenes in the process of
development and/or progression of breast cancers (11), hepatocellular carcinomas (12), pancreatic cancer (13, 14), prostate
cancers (15, 16), synovial sarcomas (17, 18), and renal cell
carcinomas (19). Such molecules are considered to be good
candidate targets for development of new therapeutic modalities.
Toward identification of molecular targets for drug development,
we had analyzed the gene expression profiles of 26 bladder cancers
and 29 normal human tissues (20, 21). Among the up-regulated
genes in bladder cancers, we focused on M-phase phosphoprotein
1 (MPHOSPH1), which was highly overexpressed in the great
majority of bladder cancer cells examined but not expressed in
normal human organs except testis. Furthermore, we identified the
interaction of MPHOSPH1 with protein regulator of cytokinesis 1
(PRC1), the expression of which was also up-regulated in bladder
cancers. We also found that suppression of either of MPHOSPH1 or
PRC1 expression using their specific small interfering RNAs
(siRNA) leads to the formation of multinuclear cells and
subsequent cell death. These findings suggest that the
MPHOSPH1/PRC1 pathway is involved in bladder carcinogenesis.
Taken together, we here propose that MPHOSPH1 may be a
promising molecular target for bladder cancer therapy through
inhibition of the MPHOSPH1/PRC1 expression or their interaction
and/or cancer vaccine-mediated immunotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Bladder cancer cell lines and tissue samples. Human bladder cancer
cell lines, HT-1197, UM-UC-3, J82, HT-1376, SW780, and RT4, were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). All of
bladder cancer cell lines, as well as COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells, were grown in
monolayer in appropriate medium [i.e., EMEM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with
0.1 mmol/L essential amino acid (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate (Roche), for HT-1197, UM-UC-3, J82, and HT-1376; L-15 for
SW780; McCoy’s 5A (Sigma) for RT4; and DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
for COS-7 and NIH3T3]. Each medium was supplemented with 10% fetal

glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a quantitative control. The sequences of each set of primers were as follows: MPHOSPH1, 5¶-CCGGGAAAGTAAACTGACTCAC-3¶ and 5¶-TTCTAGCTCCTCAACCAAATCCT-3¶; PRC1, 5¶-GTGGTCCTAGGAGACTTGGTTTT-3¶ and 5¶-TACATGCATACCCCCAACAA-3¶; and GAPDH, 5¶-CGACCACTTTGTCAAGCTCA-3¶ and 5¶-GGTTGAGCACAGGGTACTTTATT-3¶.
Northern blot analysis. Northern blot for bladder cancer cell lines was
prepared according to the procedures of our previous report (11). Human
multiple-tissue blots (Takara Clontech) and bladder cancer Northern blots
were hybridized with [a-32P]dCTP–labeled MPHOSPH1 PCR products (542
bp) of MPHOSPH1 cDNA (GenBank accession no. NM_016195) prepared by
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using the following primer set:
5¶-TGCTGGTTCAGAACGAACTATG-3¶ and 5¶-TCCTCGTGGCTAATGAAAGC-3¶. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were done
according to the supplier’s recommendations. The blots were autoradiographed with intensifying screens at 80jC for 14 days.
Construction of the expression vectors. We obtained an open reading
frame sequence of MPHOSPH1 by RT-PCR using human testis mRNA as a

HT-1376

bovine serum (Cansera International, Ontario, Canada) and 1% antibiotic/
antimycotic solution (Sigma). SW780 was maintained at 37jC in
atmosphere without CO2 although the remaining cells were maintained at
37jC in atmosphere with 5% CO2. Tissue samples from surgically resected
invasive or superficial bladder cancers and their corresponding clinical
information were obtained from five hospitals (Kochi Medical School, Kyoto
Prefectural University of Medicine, Nagoya City University Graduate School
of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical
Sciences, and Iwate Medical University) with written informed consent.
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Microdissection of
bladder cancer cells was done as previously described (20). We extracted
total RNA from each of microdissected bladder clinical samples and
cultured cells using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and purchased
polyadenylated RNAs isolated from heart, lung, liver, kidney, brain,
pancreas, testis, and bladder from Takara Clontech (Kyoto, Japan).
Subsequently, we did T7-based amplification and reverse transcription as
previously described (22). We prepared appropriate dilutions of each singlestranded cDNA for subsequent PCR by monitoring an amount of

template and KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with the
primer set as follows: forward, 5¶-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCAATGGAATCTAATTTTAATCAAGAGG-3¶; reverse, 5¶-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTTTGGCTGTTTTTGTTCGA-3¶ (underlines indicate NotI restriction enzyme site). The
PCR product was cloned into the NotI site of pCAGGSnHC expression
vector in frame with hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the COOH terminus.
For construction of the PRC1 expression vector, the entire coding
sequence of PRC1 cDNA (GenBank accession no. NM_003981) was generated by RT-PCR using a human testis mRNA as template and the following
set of primers: forward, 5¶-CCGGAATTCTCCGCCATGAGGAGAAGTGA-3¶
(underline indicates EcoRI site); reverse, 5¶-TTGCCGCTCGAGGGACTGGATGTTGGTTGAA-3¶ (underline indicates XhoI site). The PCR product was
cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pCAGGSn3FH vector in frame with
NH2-terminal FLAG tag. DNA sequences of all constructs were confirmed by
DNA sequencing (ABI3700, PE Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA).
Anti-MPHOSPH1 specific polyclonal antibodies. Plasmid designed to
express a part of MPHOSPH1 (1,612–1,780 amino acids) with His tag at its
COOH terminus was prepared using pET21 vector (Merck, Novagen,
Madison, WI). The recombinant peptide was expressed in Escherichia coli,
BL21 codon-plus strain (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and purified using both
Ni-NTA resin agarose (Qiagen) and TALON (Takara Clontech) according to
the supplier’s protocols. Subsequently, the immune sera were purified on
antigen affinity columns using Affigel-15 gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
according to the supplier’s instructions. We confirmed that this antibody
could specifically recognize endogenous MPHOSPH1 protein in UM-UC-3
bladder cancer cells by Western blot analysis. Affinity-purified antiMPHOSPH1 antibodies were used for Western blot, immunoprecipitation,
immunohistochemical analysis, and immunocytochemical analysis as
described below.
Immunohistochemical staining analysis. Conventional paraffin-embedded tissue sections from bladder cancers were obtained from surgical
specimens. To investigate the expression of MPHOSPH1 protein in clinical
materials, tissue sections were processed for antigen retrieval by autoclave
(108jC, 15 min) in antigen retrieval solution, high pH (DakoCytomation,
Carpinteria, CA), and treated with peroxidase blocking regent (DakoCytomation). Tissue sections were incubated with anti-MPHOSPH1 polyclonal
antibody at 1:80 dilution, followed by horseradish peroxidase–cojugated
secondary antibody (DakoCytomation). Antigen was visualized with
substrate-chromogen (DAKO liquid 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine chromogen,
DakoCytomation). Finally, tissue specimens were stained with hematoxylin
to discriminate nucleus from cytoplasm.
Immunocytochemical staining analysis. UM-UC-3 cells were seeded at
1  105 per well (Lab-Tek II chamber slide, Nalgen Nunc, International,
Naperville, IL). After 24 h, cells were fixed with PBS( ) containing 4%
paraformaldehyde and then rendered permeable with PBS( ) containing
0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells
were covered with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS( ) for 12 h at 4jC to
block nonspecific hybridization followed by incubation with affinitypurified anti-MPHOSPH1 polyclonal antibody diluted 1:100 in blocking
solution. After washing with PBS( ), the cells were stained with an Alexa
488–conjugated antirabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at 1:1,000
dilution. Nuclei were counterstained with 4¶,6¶-diamidine-2¶-phenylindole
dihydrochloride (DAPI). Fluorescent images were obtained under a TCS SP2
AOBS microscope (Leica, Tokyo, Japan).
Gene silencing effect by siRNA. We had previously established a vectorbased RNA interference system that was designed to synthesize siRNAs in
mammalian cells (23). Plasmids designed to express siRNA were prepared
by cloning of double-stranded oligonucleotides into the BbsI site of psiU6BX
vectors. The target sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides for RNA
interference were as follows: si-EGFP as a control, 5¶-GAAGCAGCACGACTTCTTC-3¶; siRNA-MPHOSPH1, 5¶-GTGAAGAAGTGCGACCGAA-3¶;
siRNA-MPHOSPH1 mismatch, 5¶-TTGTAGAAGTGCGACCGAG-3¶ (underlines indicate mismatched sequences in siRNA-MPHOSPH1); and siRNAPRC1, 5¶-GCATATCCGTCTGTCAGAA-3¶; siRNA-PRC1 mismatch, 5¶-TCATATCCCTCTGTAAGAT-3¶ (underlines indicate mismatched sequences in
siRNA-PRC1). DNA sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA
sequencing.

cancer cells during cell cycle. UM-UC-3 cells were immunocytochemically
stained with affinity-purified anti-MPHOSPH1 polyclonal antibody (green) and
DAPI (blue ) to discriminate nucleus (see Materials and Methods).

Eight micrograms each of siRNA expression vector were transfected into
J82 or UM-UC-3 cells (1  106 per 10-cm dish) using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) or FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche) according to the
supplier’s recommendations. To evaluate the knockdown effect of siRNAs by
semiquantitative RT-PCR with specific primers (see below), total RNAs were
extracted from the transfected cells after 4-day incubation with neomycin
(Geneticin, Invitrogen). For further evaluation of the knockdown effect at
protein level by Western blot analysis with anti-MPHOSPH1 antibody, the
cells were also harvested after 6-day incubation with neomycin. The specific
primer sets for RT-PCR are as follows: MPHOSPH1, 5¶-CCGGGAAAGTAAACTGACTCAC-3¶ and 5¶-TTCTAGCTCCTCAACCAAATCCT-3¶; PRC1,
5¶-GTGGTCCTAGGAGACTTGGTTTT-3¶ and 5¶-TACATGCATACCCCCAACAA-3¶; and, as a quantitative control, GAPDH, 5¶-CGACCACTTTGTCAAGCTCA-3¶ and 5¶-GGTTGAGCACAGGGTACTTTATT-3¶. The
transfected J82 or UM-UC-3 cells were cultured for 28 or 21 days in the
presence of 0.6 or 1.0 mg/mL neomycin, and the numbers of colonies were
counted by Giemsa staining. Viability of the J82 or UM-UC-3 cells was evaluated
by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay at 28 or 14 days after the treatment of neomycin with cell counting kit8 according to the manufacturer’s recommendation (Wako, Osaka, Japan).
Absorbance at 570-nm wavelength was measured with a microplate reader
(model 550, Bio-Rad). These experiments were done in triplicate.

vector (pCAGGSnHC) was transfected into NIH3T3 cells using FuGENE6
transfection reagent (Roche). Transfected cells were incubated in the
culture medium containing 0.9 mg/mL neomycin (Geneticin, Invitrogen).
Three weeks later, 20 individual colonies were selected by limiting dilution
and screened for clones stably expressing MPHOSPH1. The expression
level of HA-tagged MPHOSPH1 was detected in each clone by Western blot
and immunohistochemical staining analyses with anti-HA monoclonal
antibody (Sigma). We established three independent clones and designated
them as follows: NIH3T3-MPHOSPH1-1, -2, and -3, and NIH3T3-Mock-1, -2,
and -3.
Effect of MPHOSPH1 on cell growth in vitro and in vivo. To
investigate growth-promoting effect of MPHOSPH1 in vitro, we seeded each
of three independent NIH 3T3-MPHOSPH1 cells (MPHOSPH1-1, -2, and -3)
and three independent NIH 3T3-Mock cells (Mock-1, -2, and -3; 0.5  104)
and maintained them in media containing 10% FCS with 0.9 mg/mL
neomycin for 24, 48, 72, 96, or 120 h. At each time point, cell numbers were

evaluated by using cell counting kit-8 (Wako). These experiments were done
in triplicate.
In vivo experiments were done in our animal facility in accordance with
institutional guidelines. To further examine tumor growth effect of
MPHOSPH1 in nude mice, cells transfected with MPHOSPH1-1 or Mock-1
(5  106) were injected s.c. into the posterior mid-dorsum of 16 BALB/cA
Jcl-nu mice ( female, 7 weeks old). Tumor volumes were measured every
3 days for 3 weeks, and volumes were estimated by the following formula:
V = 0.5  (larger diameter)  (smaller diameter)2, as previously described
(18). Mean tumor volume F SD was plotted. Subsequently, the mice were
euthanized at 21 days, and the tumors were dissected. To confirm the
expression of MPHOSPH1 protein in tumor, Western blot analysis with antiMPHOSPH1 antibody was done.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was determined by Student’s
t test using Statview 5.0 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). P < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.

Coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses. COS-7 cells
were transiently transfected with HA-tagged MPHOSPH1 (pCAGGSnHCMPHOSPH1), FLAG-tagged PRC1 (pCAGGSn3FC-PRC1), or both together.
The cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection and then were lysed
in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5%
NP40, and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III (Calbiochem, San Diego,
CA)]. Equal amounts of total proteins were incubated at 4jC for 2 h with
2 Ag of rat anti-HA (Roche) or mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies.
Immunocomplexes were incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Zymed
Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) for 2 h at 4jC. After washing with
lysis buffer, coprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with either mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) or rat anti-HA
(Roche) antibodies.
Immunocytochemical staining analysis of MPHOSPH1 and PRC1.
UM-UC-3 cells, which endogenously express high level of MPHOSPH1 protein, were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged PRC1 (pCAGGSn3FCPRC1). Cultured cells were synchronized in their cell cycle by treatment
with aphidicolin (2 Ag/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 h and then washed five
times with PBS( ); fresh culture medium was then added to release the
cells from the cell cycle arrest. After the synchronized cells were fixed at
different cell cycle points as described in a previous section (Immuno-

cytochemical staining analysis), they were incubated with rabbit antiMPHOSPH1 and mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) antibodies, washed with
PBS( ), and stained with Alexa 594–conjugated antirabbit and Alexa 488–

images were obtained with a TCS SP2 AOBS microscope (Leica).
The knockdown effects of MPHOSPH1 and PRC1 on cell morphology.
After transfection of UM-UC-3 cells with si-EGFP (negative control),
si-MPHOSPH1, or si-PRC1 constructs as described above, their cellular
morphologies were examined. The cells were stained immunocytochemically
with Alexa 594 phalloidin (Molecular probes) and DAPI at 4 days after the
transfection. Fluorescent images were obtained under a TCS SP2 AOBS
microscope (Leica).

Results
Identification of MPHOSPH1 as an up-regulated gene in

bladder cancers by means of cDNA microarray representing 27,648

genes or expressed sequence tags (20). Among up-regulated genes,
we in this study focused on MPHOSPH1 gene whose expression was
significantly increased in the majority of bladder cancers.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments confirmed elevated expression of MPHOSPH1 in 9 of 10 clinical bladder cancers (Fig. 1A).
Subsequent Northern blot analysis confirmed that an f7 kb of
MPHOSPH1 transcript was up-regulated in all of six bladder cancer
cell lines (Fig. 1B), although its expression was hardly detectable in
any normal organs except testis (Fig. 1C). We then developed a
polyclonal antibody against MPHOSPH1 to investigate expression
of this protein in bladder cancer tissues (see Materials and
Methods). We first confirmed that the purified MPHOSPH1-specific
polyclonal antibody could recognize endogenous MPHOSPH1
(f220 kDa) protein in bladder cancer cell line UM-UC-3 without
producing any nonspecific bands (Fig. 1D). Immunohistochemical
analysis with affinity-purified anti-MPHOSPH1 polyclonal antibody
revealed positive staining in bladder cancer cells of invasive
bladder cancer tissue sections, whereas no staining was observed
in normal bladder (Fig. 1E). We also found up-regulated expression
of MPHOSPH1 in bladder cancers at an earlier stage (Fig. 1E,
superficial bladder cancer). Finally, we observed strong staining in
17 of 20 invasive types and 21 of 25 superficial types of bladder
cancer (data not shown), consistent with the results obtained by
RT-PCR. However, no difference in the intensity or other relevant
findings between superficial and invasive bladder cancer tissues
was observed by the immunohistochemical staining.
Subcellular localization of MPHOSPH1 in bladder cancer
cells. To further characterize the biological role of MPHOSPH1, we
examined the subcellular localization of endogenous MPHOSPH1 in
UM-UC-3 cells by immunocytochemical analysis with an antiMPHOSPH1 antibody. The endogenous MPHOSPH1 was mainly
localized in the nucleus of interphase cells but was observed
diffusely within M-phase cells (data not shown). Because the
immunocytochemical analysis suggested the cell cycle–dependent
localization of MPHOSPH1 protein, we synchronized UM-UC-3 cells
using aphidicolin and then examined localization of MPHOSPH1 at
different cell cycle points. As shown in Fig. 2, endogenous
MPHOSPH1 protein was localized in the nucleus at the interphase.
After disappearance of nuclear membrane, it was present diffusely in
cells at prophase, metaphase, and early anaphase. Subsequently, it
accumulated at the midzone of cells in late anaphase and was finally
concentrated at the contractile ring when cells were at telophase.
These findings suggest an important role of MPHOSPH1 in
cytokinesis in bladder cancer cells.
Oncogenic activity of MPHOSPH1. We knocked down the
expression of endogenous MPHOSPH1 in bladder cancer cell lines
J82 and UM-UC-3, which showed high level of MPHOSPH1 expression, by means of the mammalian vector–based RNA interference
technique. We examined the expression levels of MPHOSPH1 by
semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses and found
that a MPHOSPH1-specific siRNA (si-MPHOSPH1) significantly
suppressed expression of MPHOSPH1 at both mRNA and protein
levels as compared with a control siRNA construct (si-EGFP;
Fig. 3A). As concordant to the knockdown effect, colony formation
and MTT assays revealed that introduction of si-MPHOSPH1
significantly suppressed growth of both J82 and UM-UC-3 control
cells [MTT assay: J82, P < 0.001; UM-UC-3, P < 0.001 (unpaired t test);
Fig. 3B and C]. To exclude a possibility of off-target effect by siMPHOSPH1, we generated siRNA that contained a 3-bp replacement
in si-MPHOSPH1 (si-MPHOSPH1 mismatch; see Materials and
Methods) and found that this had no suppressive effect on the

www.aacrjournals.org

expression of MPHOSPH1 or the growth of bladder cancer cells
(Fig. 3).
To further confirm the growth-promoting effect of MPHOSPH1,
we established NIH3T3 derivative cells that stably expressed exogenous MPHOSPH1 (MPHOSPH1-1, -2, and -3). As shown by Western
blot analysis with anti-HA-antibody, exogenous MPHOSPH1 protein
was observed at high level in these three derivative clones (Fig. 4A).
Subsequent MTT assays showed that the three MPHOSPH1-stable
derivative cells (MPHOSPH1-1, -2, and -3) grew much faster than
those transfected with mock plasmid (Mock-1, -2, and -3; Fig. 4B),
suggesting a growth-enhancing effect of MPHOSPH1. In addition to
the rapid growth, we observed multilayer growth of these three
NIH3T3-MPHOSPH1 cells after they reached the confluence phase,
indicating loss of the contact inhibition mechanism by MPHOSPH1
introduction into NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4C).
To further investigate the oncogenic role of MPHOSPH1 in vivo,
we s.c. transplanted either NIH3T3-MPHOSPH1-1 cells or NIH3T3Mock-1 cells into BALB/cA Jcl-nu mice ( female, 7 weeks old). As
shown in Fig. 4D, none of 16 transplantations of NIH3T3-Mock-1
cells formed tumors by 21 days. In contrast, all of 16 transplantations
of NIH3T3-MPHOSPH1-1 formed tumors in which we confirmed
overexpression of MPHOSPH1 protein by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 4E). These findings imply an oncogenic role of MPHOSPH1 for
development of bladder cancer in vivo and in vitro.

the Pin1 expression was undetectable in bladder cancer cells in our
microarray data and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis (data not
shown), we attempted to identify protein(s) interacting with
MPHOSPH1 in bladder cancer cells. We focused on proteinregulating cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) protein as a possible candidate to
interact with MPHOSPH1 because PRC1 is known to be involved to
cytokinesis through the interaction with kinesin family proteins
(25, 26) and its expression pattern was similar to MPHOSPH1 in our
expression profile analysis of bladder cancers (20).
We first investigated the expression levels of PRC1 in bladder
cancers by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis and found coupregulation of PRC1 and MPHOSPH1 in bladder cancer cases
(Fig. 5A). Subsequently, to confirm the interaction between
MPHOSPH1 and PRC1, we did coimmunoprecipitation experiments (see Materials and Methods). HA-tagged MPHOSPH1
(MPHOSPH1-HA) and FLAG-tagged PRC1 (PRC1-FLAG) constructs
were cotransfected into COS-7 cells and the cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies. Immunoblotting of the precipitates with rabbit anti-FLAG and mouse
anti-HA antibodies revealed that MPHOSPH1-HA had coprecipitated with PRC1-FLAG protein (Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, we did immunocytochemical analysis of MPHOSPH1
and PRC1 in UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells. The PRC1-FLAG
construct was transfected into UM-UC-3 cells according to the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

procedure described in Materials and Methods. The results showed
that exogenous PRC1 colocalized with endogenous MPHOSPH1 in
the cells at interphase, prophase, and late anaphase (Fig. 6A).
However, interestingly, in the cells at telophase, MPHOSPH1 was
likely to overlap with PRC1 but be located adjacently outside of PRC1
in the center of midbody (Fig. 6B).
Growth-inhibitory effects of PRC1-specific siRNAs in bladder cancer. To further validate the biological significance of PRC1
in bladder carcinogenesis, we constructed PRC1-specific siRNA
expression vectors and examined the knockdown effect of each
construct in J82 and UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cell lines, which
overexpressed PRC1 and MPHOSPH1 (data not shown). Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that si-PRC1 had drastic knockdown
effect on PRC1 expression, whereas a si-PRC1 mismatch construct
that contained a 4-bp replacement to si-PRC1 or a negative control
si-EGFP revealed no knockdown effect (Fig. 7A). Introduction of
si-PRC1 into J82 and UM-UC-3 cells resulted in a significant
decrease of the number of colonies and of cell viability, whereas
control siRNA and a si-PRC1 mismatch had no or little effect on
colony number or cell viability (Fig. 7B and C). These findings
suggest that PRC1 is also likely to have crucial roles in the growth
of bladder cancer cells.

UM-UC-3 cells transfected with either MPHOSPH1- or PRC1-specific
siRNA that revealed the significant knockdown effect (see Materials
and methods). We observed a significant increase of multinuclear
cells by introduction of each siRNA (si-MPHOSPH1 and si-PRC1) at
4 days after the transfection (Fig. 7D, top). Immunocytochemical
analysis using Alexa 594 phalloidin confirmed the presence of
multiple nuclei in the cells transfected with si-MPHOSPH1 or
si-PRC1 (Fig. 7D, bottom). These findings indicate that the absence

of MPHOSPH1 or PRC1 caused the failure of cytokinesis, resulted in
formation of multinucleated cells, and then induced cell death.

Discussion
Significant advances in development of molecular targeting drugs
for cancer therapy have been achieved in the last two decades.
However, the proportion of patients showing good response to

presently available treatments is still very limited and a subset of the
patients suffer from severe adverse reactions without any benefit
(3). Hence, it is urgent to develop new anticancer agents that are
highly specific to malignant cells, with a minimum risk of adverse
reactions. Through the detailed expression profile analysis of
clinical invasive bladder cancers, we identified MPHOSPH1 to be
significantly overexpressed in majority of invasive bladder cancer
cases. We here reported the biological significance of MPHOSPH1
and its interacting partner, PRC1, in bladder carcinogenesis.
Northern blot analysis revealed the hardly detectable level of
MPHOSPH1 expression in any of normal human tissues examined
except the testis. Moreover, immunohistochemical experiments
with anti-MPHOSPH1 polyclonal antibody clearly indicated
MPHOSPH1 expression in both invasive and superficial bladder
cancer cells, indicating MPHOSPH1 to be a cancer-testis antigen.
These results implied that MPHOSPH1 could serve as a valuable
target for development of anticancer agents or cancer peptide
vaccines for bladder cancer.
MPHOSPH1 was previously reported as one of proteins that were
specifically phosphorylated at the G2-M transition and as a plusend–directed kinesin-related protein with a crucial role in
cytokinesis (24, 27). The MPHOSPH1 cDNA encodes a 1,780amino-acid protein that was composed of three domains: an NH2terminal kinesin motor domain, a central coiled-coil stalk domain,
and a C-globular tail domain. Our immunocytochemical experiments indicated the localization of MPHOSPH1 to be in the nucleus
in the bladder cancer cells at the interphase, in the midzone in late
anaphase, and at the contractile ring in telophase. Furthermore, we
showed that knockdown of endogenous MPHOSPH1 by siRNAs
induced failure of cytokinesis in bladder cancer cells and resulted in
accumulation of multinuclear cells and subsequent cell death. In
addition, introduction of MPHOSPH1 into NIH3T3 cells significantly
enhanced cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Hence, we further
examined the biological roles of MPHOSPH1 in bladder cancer cells
by identification of its interacting protein(s).
Due to the coexpression in bladder cancers and the similarity in
subcellular protein localization, we focused on PRC1 as a candidate
to interact with MPHOSPH1. We showed the in vivo interaction and
colocalization of MPHOSPH1 and PRC1 during interphase to late
anaphase in bladder cancer cells. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 6B,
MPHOSPH1 was observed in the lateral position of PRC1 in the
midbody of telophase cells. PRC1 was reported to interact with

kinesin family proteins, KIF4 or KIF14, which are also associated with
mitotic events, especially with cytokinesis (28–30). It is considered to
be a central spindle matrix protein that is essential to control many
motor proteins associated with this structure (31). Particularly, KIF4
is known to be the motor protein that translocates PRC1 along the
mitotic spindle during mitosis, especially telophase to cytokinesis
(28). Moreover, Zhu and Jiang (29) reported that KIF4 interacts with
PRC1 in vivo through the KIF4 COOH-terminal stalk plus tail domain,
and PRC1 is a downstream cargo of KIF4 on the spindle during
mitosis. However, because the expression of those kinesin family
proteins in the bladder cancer cells was not detected in our
microarray data (20) and MPHOSPH1 bound to PRC1 through its
COOH-terminal stalk plus tail domain (data not shown), MPHOSPH1
might function as a motor protein that translocates PRC1 along the
mitotic spindles during mitosis of bladder cancer cells.
To assess whether MPHOSPH1 or PRC1 plays a critical role in the
growth or survival of bladder cancer cells, we knocked down the
expression of endogenous MPHOSPH1 or PRC1 in bladder cancer
cell lines, J82 or UM-UC-3, which revealed high expression levels of
MPHOSPH1 and PRC1 using specific siRNAs. Each of the specific
siRNAs significantly suppressed their expression and resulted in
the significant growth suppression of these cells, indicating that
both MPHOSPH1 and PRC1 are essential for the growth of bladder
cancer cells. Moreover, knockdown of MPHOSPH1 or PRC1 expression in UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells caused a significant increase
of multinuclear cells (Fig. 7D). Because inhibition of their
interaction may lead to cell death following the failure of cytokinesis
in bladder cancer cells, the inhibitor for their interaction would be a
possible valuable target to develop agents against bladder cancer.
Although further analysis of the function of MPHOSPH1 will be
necessary, the data provided should contribute to a more profound
understanding of bladder cancer carcinogenesis and to development of novel therapies for bladder cancers.
