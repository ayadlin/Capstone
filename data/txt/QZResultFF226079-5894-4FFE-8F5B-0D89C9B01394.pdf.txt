Cultured pluripotent stem cells are a cornerstone of regenerative medicine due to their ability
to give rise to all cell types of the body. Although pluripotent stem cells can be propagated
indefinitely in vitro, pluripotency is paradoxically a transient state in vivo, lasting 2-3 days
around the time of blastocyst implantation1. The exception to this rule is embryonic
diapause, a reversible state of suspended development triggered by unfavorable conditions2.
Diapause is a physiological reproductive strategy widely employed across the animal
kingdom, including in mammals, but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here we
report that partial inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTor), a major nutrient
sensor and promoter of growth3, induces reversible pausing of mouse blastocyst
development and allows their prolonged culture ex vivo. Paused blastocysts remain
pluripotent and competent to give rise to embryonic stem (ES) cells and mice. We show that
both naturally diapaused blastocysts in vivo and paused blastocysts ex vivo display
pronounced reductions in mTor activity, translation, histone modifications associated with
gene activity and transcription. Pausing can be induced directly in cultured ES cells and
sustained for weeks without appreciable cell death or deviations from cell cycle
distributions. We show that paused ES cells display a remarkable global suppression of

transcription, maintain a gene expression signature of diapaused blastocysts and remain
pluripotent. These results uncover a new pluripotent stem cell state corresponding to the
epiblast of the diapaused blastocyst and indicate that mTor regulates developmental timing at
peri-implantation. Our findings have important implications in the fields of assisted
reproduction, regenerative medicine, cancer, metabolic disorders and aging.

Preimplantation mammalian embryos can develop in suspension culture ex vivo up to the
blastocyst stage. The E3.5 mouse blastocyst collapses after ~24-48 hours (Fig. 1a), but its
survival can be extended for several days if nutrients like glucose or certain amino acids are
removed from the medium4,5. We hypothesized that inhibiting growth pathways might
induce a viable dormant state in blastocysts. We isolated blastocysts and cultured them ex
vivo in the presence of small molecule inhibitors of translation, mTor signaling, Myc family
transcription factors or histone acetyltransferases (HATs) (Fig. 1a, b). We found that
inhibition of translation, Myc or HATs has minimal effects on blastocyst survival,
prolonging it by a maximum of 1 day relative to controls (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1c-f).
These results are in agreement with recent findings describing culture of Myc-depleted
blastocysts for 18 hours6. Remarkably, reducing mTor activity using INK1287 enables a
major extension of blastocyst culture by 9-12 days [Equivalent Days of Gestation (EDG)
12.5-15.5] for the majority of embryos, reaching a maximum of 22 days ex vivo, i.e.,
EDG25.5 (Fig. 1b). Given that mouse gestation lasts 19 days, these data indicate that
blastocysts can be maintained in culture past the time it would take for birth to occur.
Another recently developed inhibitor of mTor (RapaLink-1), which like INK128 inhibits
both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes8, greatly extends blastocyst survival ex vivo
(Extended Data Fig. 1a-c). Allosteric inhibitors like Rapamycin, which target just the
mTORC1 complex, only marginally extend blastocyst survival (Extended Data Fig. 1a-c),
suggesting that inhibition of both complexes is required for developmental pausing. mTorinhibited blastocysts retain a well-expanded blastocoel, activity of the Oct4/GFP transgene
and normal expression patterns of Nanog and Rex1 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2a, b).
Apoptosis markers are largely absent in the inner cell mass (ICM) but can be detected in the
trophectoderm (TE) of mTor-inhibited blastocysts (Extended Data Fig. 2c, d).
Blastocysts cultured for 7 days in mTor inhibitor give rise to ES cells (Fig. 1c, d) that
express pluripotency markers (Fig. 1e). Moreover, blastocysts cultured in mTor inhibitor for
4-5 days can give rise to live-born, fertile mice (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). These
results indicate that mTor inhibition induces and sustains a reversible paused pluripotent
state (referred to as ‘paused’ from here onwards). Interestingly, cleavage-stage embryos
cannot be paused by inhibition of mTor and instead develop with a slight delay to the
blastocyst stage (Extended Data Fig. 3c).

Mouse blastocysts can undergo diapause in utero for up to 2 weeks if the pregnant female is
lactating, a state that can be simulated hormonally9. In fact, the first ES cell lines were
derived from diapaused blastocysts10. We compared EDG8.5 blastocysts generated either ex
vivo via mTor inhibition or in vivo by hormonally inducing diapause in pregnant females9
(Fig. 2a, b). A primary function of mTor is to induce high translational output in growing
cells by directly phosphorylating and inactivating 4EBP1, a repressor of translation3. The
levels of Phospho-4EBP1, a target of mTORC1, are significantly reduced in paused and

diapaused blastocysts relative to control blastocysts (Fig. 2c, d). Phospho-Akt, an mTORC2
target and positive regulator of proliferation and metabolism3, is also reduced in paused
blastocysts, and to a lesser extent in diapaused blastocysts (Fig. 2c, d). Moreover, blastocysts
paused ex vivo and diapaused in vivo display significant reductions in nascent protein
synthesis relative to control embryos (Fig. 2e, f). These results are in agreement with
previous reports showing reduced translation in diapaused blastocysts6,11. However,
suppressed translation alone is not sufficient to drive pausing, evidenced by the only slight
extension in ex vivo blastocyst survival upon inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 1b).

mTor is known to phosphorylate and inactivate regulators of autophagy. One major mTor
target in this context is Ulk1 (also known as Atg1)12. Consistent with this notion, paused and
diapaused blastocysts have reduced levels of Phospho-Ulk1 (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b).
Autophagy has previously been shown to be required for pre-implantation development13
and implicated in blastocyst diapause in vivo14. We found that the survival ratio and
longevity of paused blastocysts are significantly reduced when co-treated with the Ulk1
inhibitor SBI-0206965 (Extended Data Fig. 4c-e). Taken together with the published
literature, these data suggest that autophagy is a component of blastocyst maintenance
during developmental pausing.

We asked whether inhibition of growth and translation are associated with changes in
transcriptional activity and chromatin landscape. We found that both paused and diapaused
blastocysts display a remarkable reduction in nascent transcription (Fig. 2e, f). By
immunofluorescence we did not detect significant changes in the global levels of H3K4me3,
a chromatin mark associated with active promoters, or H3K9me3, a heterochromatin mark
(Extended Data Fig. 5b, c). In contrast, we found that both paused blastocysts and diapaused
blastocysts exhibit sharply reduced levels of H4K16ac, H4K5/8/12ac and H3K36me2,
particularly in the ICM (Fig. 2g, h and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Histone H4 acetylation and
H3K36me2 are highly correlated with transcriptional activity. Thus, developmental pausing
involves a chromatin landscape associated with suppressed transcription. Nevertheless,
neither inhibition of histone acetylation nor suppression of Myc-mediated transcription15,16
can sustain a paused blastocyst state (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the TE and the ICM appear to
differ in terms of changes to their chromatin landscapes in response to mTor inhibition, yet
both display suppressed transcription and translation in agreement with data implicating
mTor in TE differentiation17. These results suggest that a combination of multiple effects
downstream of mTor inhibition on both the ICM and the TE mediates blastocyst pausing.

Pluripotency exists in different states in vivo, which can be captured in vitro using distinct
media formulations for ES cell culture1. We sought to capture the paused pluripotent state in
vitro by inhibiting mTor. ES cells cultured in serum with mTor inhibitor (‘paused’) grow at a
much slower rate than cells in either serum or 2i/vitamin C18,19 conditions (Fig. 3b). Paused
ES cells can be sustained in culture for weeks without appreciable cell death (Fig. 3c),
unlike ES cells with reduced levels of Myc activity6, and rapidly resume growth upon
release from the mTor inhibitor (Fig. 3d).
Paused ES cells show the same cell cycle distribution as serum cells, whereas 2i cells have a
slightly higher proportion of cells in G0/G1 (Fig. 3e). However, the 5-ethynyl-2’-

deoxyuridine (EdU) label, which marks S phase, is diluted at a much slower rate in paused
cells than in serum cells (Fig. 3f). These data suggest that paused ES cells progress slower
through the cell cycle without a preferential accumulation at any particular stage. Similarly
to paused and diapaused blastocysts, paused ES cells have reduced levels of mTORC1/2
activity and nascent translation, correlating with a decrease in cell size (Extended Data Fig.
6b-d). Upon release from pause, ES cells contribute to high-grade, germline-transmitting
mouse chimeras (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 6e), confirming their full developmental
potential in vivo.

Paused ES cells display a global suppression of transcription, evident at both the total and
nascent RNA levels (Fig. 4a, b). We next analyzed the transcriptome of ES cells in serum, 2i
and paused conditions. Due to the significant differences in total RNA levels per cell
between the three states, we first performed cell number-normalized RNA-seq (See
Methods, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 2). The analysis revealed a
remarkably suppressed transcriptome in paused ES cells (Fig. 4c), in line with the
hypotranscriptional state observed in paused and diapaused blastocysts. Interestingly, while
the vast majority of genes are downregulated in the paused state relative to serum or 2i
conditions, some transcriptional and translational repressors are selectively upregulated in
paused ES cells (Fig. 4d). To further probe the expression differences between the three
states, we analyzed gene expression levels relative to the total abundance of mRNA within
each condition (i.e., sequencing depth normalization, see Methods and Extended Data Fig.
8a). We found that the distribution of the transcriptome of paused ES cells is significantly
biased towards a relative upregulation of repressors of transcription (Extended Data Fig. 8bd and Supplementary Table 3). These results indicate that paused ES cells are characterized
by a global state of hypotranscription, potentially mediated by a set of transcriptional
repressors. These features make the paused ES cell transcriptome readily distinguishable
from serum and 2i ES cells.

Author Manuscript

We next compared the transcriptomes of serum, 2i and paused ES cells to recently published
gene expression data of various developmental stages, including diapause20 (see Methods).
This analysis revealed that paused ES cells have significant similarities with the diapaused
epiblast but not with other developmental stages (Fig. 4e, f). These similarities are evident
whether differential gene expression is analyzed at the individual gene level or aggregated
into Gene Ontology terms or annotated cellular pathways (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig.
9a, b). Unlike paused ES cells, the transcriptome of Myc-depleted cells6 is not consistently
correlated with that of the diapaused epiblast (compare Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 9 with
Extended Data Fig. 10). Pathway analyses comparing paused ES cells, Myc-depleted ES
cells and the diapause epiblast show that, while upregulated pathways are often concordant,
several downregulated pathways are discordant in Myc-depleted ES cells (Extended Data
Fig. 10e). Interestingly, pathways coordinately up-regulated in paused ES cells and the
diapaused epiblast are associated with sugar and lipid metabolism and are down-regulated in
diseases such as diabetes and immune disorders (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Taken together, our
results document that paused blastocysts and paused ES cells induced by mTor inhibition
mimic natural diapause functionally and at the molecular level.

In summary, we show here that inhibition of mTor allows the reversible suspension of
developmental timing in mammalian embryos ex vivo (Fig. 4g). mTor is essential for growth
of mouse embryos at peri-implantation21-23. Our results document that inhibiting mTor
captures a novel pluripotent stem cell state that, unlike previously described ES cell states,
corresponds to a stage that can persist for weeks in vivo. These results pave the way for a
genetic and molecular dissection of embryonic diapause. We speculate that the
combinatorial effects of mTor inhibition on transcription, translation and metabolism may be
key to achieving developmental pausing. The ability to inhibit mTor with small molecules
allows direct comparisons to other organisms and will contribute to studies of the evolution
of developmental pausing24. It will be of interest to explore the utility of manipulations of
the mTor pathway in assisted reproduction, regenerative medicine, preservation of cell
viability after trauma and aging. Moreover, the finding that mTor inhibition induces a
reversibly paused state in ES cells should be taken into consideration in cancer therapies that
make use of mTor inhibitors.

Methods
Animal work

Author Manuscript

The following strains of mice were used (see details in following sections): Swiss Webster
females and males, C57BL/6J or C57BL6/N males, B6.Cg-Tg(Pou5f1-GFP)1Scho25 males,
CD-1 females and males. 6 to 10 week-old female mice, and 6 week- to 6 month-old male
mice were used. Animals were maintained on 12 h light/dark cycle and provided with food
and water ad libitum in individually ventilated units (Techniplast at TCP, Lab Products at
UCSF)) in the specific-pathogen free facilities at UCSF and at TCP. All procedures
involving animals were performed in compliance with the protocol approved by the IACUC
at UCSF, as part of an AAALAC-accredited care and use program (protocol AN091331-03);
and according to the Animals for Research Act of Ontario and the Guidelines of the
Canadian Council on Animal Care. Animal Care Committee reviewed and approved all
procedures conducted on animals at TCP. No blinding was done for animal studies. Samples
were not randomized. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size
estimate.
Embryo culture

Author Manuscript

Unless otherwise indicated, Swiss Webster females were mated to Swiss Webster males, or
to C57BL/6 males homozygous for an Oct4/GFP transgene (B6.Cg-Tg(Pou5f1GFP)1Scho)25. Preimplantation embryos were harvested at indicated time-points after
detection of the copulatory plug by flushing oviducts (E1.5-E2.5) or uteri (E3.5) of pregnant
females using M2 medium (Zenith Biotech) supplemented with 2% BSA (Sigma).
Subsequent embryo culture was performed in 4-well plates in 5% O2, 5% CO2 at 37°C in
KSOMAA Evolve medium (Zenith Biotech) with 2% BSA and the following inhibitors, after
optimization of concentrations: 200 nM INK128 (Medchem Express), 2.5 μM 10058-F4
(Sigma), 100 ng/ml Cycloheximide (Amresco), 50 μM Anacardic Acid (Sigma). Other mTor
inhibitors [AZD2014, Everolimus and Rapamycin (Medchem Express) and RapaLink-1 (gift
of Kevan Shokat)] and autophagy inhibitors chloroquine (Sigma) and SBI-0206965

(Medchem Express) were used at the indicated concentrations under same culture
conditions.
Diapause induction
Diapause was induced as previously described9 after natural mating of Swiss Webster mice.
Briefly, pregnant females were injected at E2.5 and EDG5.5 with 10 μg Tamoxifen
(intraperitoneally) and at E2.5 only with 3 mg Medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate
(subcutaneously). Diapaused blastocysts were flushed from uteri in M2 media after 4 days of
diapause at EDG8.5.
Embryo Transfer

Author Manuscript

Both surgical and Non-Surgical Embryo Transfers (NSET) were performed. For surgical
transfers, superovulated CD-1 females were mated to C57BL/6J or C57BL6/N males and
embryos were flushed at E3.5. Embryo culture (as described above) and surgical embryo
transfer into the uteri of 2.5 dpc pseudopregnant CD-1 females previously mated with
vasectomized CD-1 males was performed essentially as described26. For NSET, Swiss
Webster females were mated to vasectomized CD-1 males and transfer was performed at
E2.5 of surrogate according to manufacturer's instructions (ParaTechs, Lexington). Prior to
embryo transfer, embryos were cultured in KSOMAA, 2% BSA without inhibitor for 1 hour.
In the cases indicated (Extended Data Fig. 1a), Caesarian delivery was performed at E20,
followed by fostering to Swiss Webster females. Coat color markers (agouti vs. albino) were
used to distinguish transferred embryos after birth.
ES cell derivation

Author Manuscript

ES cell derivation was performed as previously described27. Swiss Webster females were
naturally mated to Swiss Webster-C57BL/6 males heterozygous for an Oct4/GFP transgene
(B6.Cg-Tg(Pou5f1-GFP)1Scho)25. Blastocysts were harvested by flushing uteri of pregnant
females at E3.5, and were seeded on feeders either immediately or after culturing for 7 days
in KSOMAA, 2% BSA, 200 nM INK128. Imaging of fluorescence driven by the Oct4/GFP
transgene and alkaline phosphatase activity (VECTOR Red AP Substrate Kit, Vector
Laboratories) was performed using a Leica DM IRB microscope.
Embryo Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

For immunofluorescence stainings, normal (E3.5), in vivo diapaused or ex vivo paused
embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, washed with PBS and
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 minutes. After blocking in PBS, 2.5%
BSA, 5% donkey serum for 1 hour, embryos were incubated overnight at 4°C with the
following primary antibodies in blocking solution: Phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46, clone
236B4), Phospho-Akt (Ser473), Phospho-Ulk1 (Ser757), Nanog, c-Parp, c-Caspase3 (all
from Cell Signaling), H3K4me3, H4K16ac, H4K5/8/12ac, H3K9me3 (all from Millipore),
Oct4 and Rex1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and H3K36me2 (Abcam). Embryos were
washed in PBS-Tween20, 2.5% BSA, incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Invitrogen) for 2 hours at room temperature, and mounted in VectaShield
mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). For labeling nascent transcription or

translation, embryos were labeled in their respective culture medium for 20 minutes with EU
(5-ethynyl uridine) or HPG (L-homopropargylglycine) following the manufacturer's
instructions for Click-iT RNA and protein labeling kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Imaging
was performed using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with automated z-stacking at 10 μm
intervals. Cell Profiler Software28 was used for image quantification and Prism (Graphpad
Software) was used for plotting data points. Datasets do not show similar variance between
control and paused/diapaused embryos in all cases, therefore we applied Welch's correction
to the statistical analysis.
ES cell culture

Author Manuscript

E14 (source: Bill Skarnes, Sanger Institute), Oct4-GiP (source: Austin Smith, U.
Cambridge) and v6.5 (source: Robert Blelloch, UCSF) ES cell lines were used. ‘Serum’
cells were cultured in ES-FBS medium: DMEM GlutaMAX with Na Pyruvate (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), 15% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), 0.1 mM Non-essential amino acids, 50
U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (UCSF Cell Culture Facility), 0.1 mM EmbryoMax 2Mercaptoethanol (Millipore) and 2000 U/ml ESGRO supplement (LIF, Millipore). ‘2i’ cells
were cultured in ES-2i medium: DMEM/F-12, Neurobasal medium, 1x N2/B27 supplements
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 μM PD0325901, 3 μM CHIR99021 (Selleck Chemicals), 50
μM Ascorbic acid (Sigma) and 2000 U/ml ESGRO supplement (LIF) (Millipore). ‘Paused’
cells were cultured in ES-FBS medium containing 200 nM INK128 (Medchem). ES cells
can also be paused in 2i medium, but the mTor inhibitor needs to be removed at each
passaging and reintroduced after colony formation to avoid major cell death (Extended Data
Fig. 6a). The cell lines have not been authenticated. E14 and v6.5 tested negative for
mycoplasma contamination. Oct4-GiP was not tested.

Generation of chimeras

Author Manuscript

R1 (129S1x129X1)29 and G4 (129S6xB6N)30 ES cells were used for morula aggregations.
ES cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS (Wisent, lot tested to support
generation of germline chimeras), 10% KnockOut Serum Replacement, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1
mM Na Pyruvate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol (all
Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1000 U/ml LIF (Millipore). G4 ES cells were grown on MEF
obtained from TgN(DR4)1Jae/J mice at all times except one passage on gelatinized tissue
culture plates before aggregation. R1 ES cells were cultured in feeder-free conditions on
gelatinized tissue culture plates. CD-1 (ICR) (Charles River) outbred albino stock was used
as embryo donors for aggregation with ES cells and as pseudopregnant recipients. Details of
morula aggregation can be found in26. Briefly, embryos were collected at E2.5 from
superovulated CD-1(ICR) female mice. Zonae pellucidae of embryos were removed by the
treatment with acid Tyrode's solution (Sigma). ES cell colonies were treated with 0.05%
Trypsin-EDTA to lift loosely connected clumps. Each zona-free embryo was aggregated
with 10-15 ES cells inside depression well made in the plastic dish with an aggregation
needle (BLS Ltd, Hungary) and cultured overnight in microdrops of KSOMAA covered by
embryo-tested mineral oil (Zenith Biotech) at 37°C in 94% air/6% CO2. The following
morning morulae and blastocysts were transferred into the uteri of E2.5 pseudopregnant
CD-1 (ICR) females previously mated with vasectomized males. Chimeras were identified at
birth by the presence of black eyes and later by the coat pigmentation. Chimeric males with

more than 50% coat colour contribution were individually bred with CD-1(ICR) females.
Germline transmission of ES cell genome was determined by eye pigmentation of pups at
birth and later by the coat pigmentation.
Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

1 × 106 cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 1x Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM NaVO4 and 5 mM NaF. Extracts were loaded into 4-15%
Mini-Protean TGX SDS Page gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to PVDF
membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk/PBS-T buffer for 30 min and incubated
either overnight at 4°C or 1 hour at room temperature with the following antibodies: 4EBP1
(total or pThr37/46), S6K1 (total or pThr389), Akt (total or pSer473), mTor (total or
pSer2448) (Cell Signaling Technology), Gapdh (Millipore) and anti-rabbit/mouse secondary
antibodies. Membranes were incubated with ECL or ECL Plus reagents and exposed to Xray films (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Cell cycle analysis

Author Manuscript

4 × 105 cells were seeded on 6-well plates. After overnight culture, cells were incubated for
1 hour with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) diluted to 10 μM in the indicated ES cell
media. All samples were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Click-iT
EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). EdU incorporation was
detected by Click-iT chemistry with an azide-modified Alexa Fluor 488. Cells were
resuspended in EdU permeabilization/wash reagent and incubated for 30 minutes with
FxCycle Violet Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For EdU dilution
experiments, ES cells were labeled for 90 minutes in serum, and afterwards were split into
either serum or pause conditions; EdU analysis was done every 12 hours for 48 hours. Flow
cytometric was performed on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo
v10.0.8. Datasets show similar variance.
Analysis of nascent transcription or translation
Total nascent transcription (Ethynyl Uridine, EU) or translation (L-homopropargylglycine,
HPG) were assessed in ES cells using the Click-iT RNA Alexa Fluor 488 HCS Assay kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were
analyzed on a BD LSRII. Datasets show similar variance.
Analysis of Apoptosis

Author Manuscript

After overnight culture on a 96-well plate, ESCs were washed once with PBS and
trypsinized to single cells. They were resuspended in 10 μl of Annexin V diluted 1:100 in
Binding Buffer (BioLegend) and incubated for 10 minutes in the dark. Cells were
resuspended in 90 μl of binding buffer with Sytox Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at
1:10,000. Data were collected on a BD LSRII. Datasets show similar variance.
Generation and sequencing of RNA-seq samples
Three replicates were used for all samples. Freshly collected single cell suspensions were
sorted on a FACSAriaII cell sorter to collect 105 cells for each sample. Total RNA was

isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). All samples were spiked-in with ERCC control
RNAs (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer's recommendations. mRNA
isolation and library preparation were performed on 250 ng total RNA from all samples
using NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs).
Samples were sequenced at The Center for Advanced Technology, UCSF on Illumina
HiSeq2500.
Mapping Reads

Author Manuscript

Single-end 50-bp reads were mapped to the mm10 mouse reference genome using Tophat231
with default parameters. We used Cuffnorm and Cuffdiff with the gtf file from UCSC mm10
(Illumina iGenomes July 17, 2015 version) as transcript annotation to evaluate relative
expression level of genes (FPKM) and call differentially expressed genes. The alignment
rate exceeded 96% in all of our samples, yielding ~40 million aligned reads per sample.
Data from Boroviak et al.20 and Scognamiglio et al.11 were downloaded from GEO and
ArrayExpress, respectively, and processed with the same pipeline as our data.
Normalizing Absolute Expression

Author Manuscript

The absolute abundance of mRNA transcripts was estimated using the ERCC92 RNA spikein32. ERCC92 contains 92 synthetic sequences with lengths ranging from 250 to 2000 bp
and concentration ranging over several orders of magnitude. ERCC sequences were designed
to mimic mammalian mRNA, but are not homologous to the mouse genome, ensuring their
unique mappability. We have aligned the reads to the 92 reference spike-in sequences and
compared the abundance of these sequences between different samples. Since ERCC
sequence abundances followed a highly linear trend in all pairs of samples across at least 5
orders of magnitude (Pearson correlation coefficient larger than 99.7%, see Extended Data
Fig. 8), we assessed the absolute abundance of mRNA as the number of mRNA fragments
per kilobase of transcript per 10 thousand mapped reads of ERCC. The overall abundance of
ERCC spike-in sequences in our samples varied from 0.3% to 0.5% of aligned reads.

To facilitate better comparison between our and Boroviak et al.'s data20 and to reduce
possible batch effects, in Fig. 4e, we followed the “batch mean-centering” approach widely
used in microarray gene expression data analysis for batch effect removal33. Specifically, we
have separately mean-centered the log2(FPKM + 1) value of each gene by subtracting the
mean log2(FPKM + 1) across all our samples (serum, 2i and paused) and across Boroviak et
al.'s samples. The numerical values of the mean-centered expression may not be directly
comparable across all samples, because they may still have different dynamic ranges in
different batches. We therefore used 1 - Spearman correlation coefficient as distance in the
hierarchical clustering.
Clustering analysis
In Fig. 4c, we identified 5992 genes with robust expression (cell number normalized
expression value > 50 in Serum, 2i, or Paused states). The cell number normalized
expression value of each gene was standardized across the 9 samples by subtracting the

mean and then dividing by the standard deviation. Hierarchical clustering was performed
using the standardized expression values using Euclidean metric and average linkage. In Fig.
4e, in order to compare our samples with those from Boroviak et al., we used the
log2(FPKM + 1) value of each gene. Hierarchical clustering was performed using meancentered (within each batch) expression values of 9418 genes robustly expressed (FPKM >
10) in at least one cell state (serum, 2i, paused, diapause EPI, E2.5 MOR, E3.5 ICM, E4.5
EPI, E4.5 PrE, E5.5 EPI, or ESC 2i/LIF). 1 - Spearman correlation coefficient was used as
distance and average linkage was used.
Pairwise GO term expression analysis

Author Manuscript

For each of the 3772 GO terms that are associated with at least 10 genes34, we defined the
GO term expression as the mean FPKM values of genes associated with the corresponding
term. In Fig. 4f, The log2 fold-change of GO term expressions between paused ES cells and
serum ES cells was plotted on the y-axis against that between various samples in Boroviak et
al. (2015) and E4.5 EPI on the x-axis. The Spearman correlation coefficient of the 3772 GO
terms is indicated. Extended Data Fig. 10 was generated similarly, but with the log2 foldchange of GO term expressions between Myc DKO and WT cells from Scognamiglio et
al.11 on the y-axis.
Pairwise pathway expression analysis

Author Manuscript

For each of the 281 KEGG pathways that contain at least 10 genes35, we defined the
pathway expression as the mean FPKM values of genes associated with the corresponding
pathway. In Extended Data Fig. 9b, the log2 fold change of pathway expressions between
paused ES cells and serum ES cells was plotted on the y-axis against that between various
samples in Boroviak et al. and E4.5 EPI. The Spearman correlation coefficient of the 281
pathways was indicated. Extended Data Fig. 10c was generated similarly, but with the log2
fold change of pathway expressions between Myc dKO and WT cells from Scognamiglio et
al.11 on the y-axis.

ERCC sequence abundances followed a highly linear trend in all pairs of samples across at
least 5 orders of magnitude. The absolute abundance of mRNA transcripts was estimated
using the ERCC92 RNA spike-ins32. Sequencing reads were aligned to the 92 reference
spike-in sequences and the abundance of these sequences between different samples was
compared. ERCC sequence abundances followed a highly linear trend in all pairs of samples
across at least 5 orders of magnitude (Pearson correlation coefficient larger than 99.7%).
Diagonal entries in the figure matrix show the density of read counts. ERCC RNAs are
consistently detected at higher abundance in the paused state compared to serum and 2i.
