BACKGROUND. Relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma has a very poor
prognosis. The authors evaluated the response rates and survival times of
patients treated with an intense regimen known to be effective against untreated
aggressive mantle cell lymphoma: rituximab plus hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) alternating with rituximab
plus methotrexate-cytarabine.

METHODS. In this prospective, open-label, phase 2 study, patients received this
combination for 6 to 8 cycles. Twenty-nine patients were evaluable for response.

RESULTS. The median number of cycles received was 5 (range, 1-7 cycles), and
the overall response rate was 93% (45% complete response [CR] or CR unconfirmed [CRu] and 48% partial response [PR]). All 5 patients previously resistant to

2-year continuous progression-free survival,9 suggesting a graft-versus-lymphoma effect. The best outcomes are reserved, however, for patients who
achieve a CR after salvage therapy. Thus, the effectiveness of the salvage regimen given before stemcell transplantation is crucial to the success of these
transplants and important to improvement of patient
of survival rates.
Intensive therapies that have shown activity in
other MCL settings may be applicable to relapsed or
refractory disease. In particular, rituximab in combination with hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin [Adriamycin], and dexamethasone)
alternating with rituximab plus methotrexate-cytarabine has resulted in an 87% CR rate among untreated
patients with aggressive MCL.10 A logical next step is
introduction of this regimen in the management of
relapsed or refractory MCL. We report here the
results of a phase 2, prospective, clinical trial of this
regimen in relapsed or refractory MCL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive MCL
were recruited and then, if eligible and after signing
an informed consent form, were enrolled in this phase
2 prospective clinical trial at the University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The study design was
approved by the institutional review board.
Patients eligible for inclusion in the study had
MCL with a diffuse or nodular pattern or a blastoid
cytologic variant. Patients who had MCL with a pure
mantle zone pattern were excluded. Other eligibility
criteria included age older than 16 years (no upper
limit), good performance status (Zubrod score of 2 or
less),11 and adequate organ function, defined as cardiac ejection fraction 50%, serum bilirubin level
<1.5 mg/dL, and serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL.
Moreover, the study required an absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) 1000/lL and a platelet count
100,000/lL, unless a lower value was due to the
lymphoma. All patients had to agree to receive transfusions of blood products as needed.
Patients were ineligible if they had central nervous system involvement, were infected with the
human immunodeficiency virus, were pregnant, had
comorbid physical or mental illness that precluded
treatment, or had a second malignancy that caused a
predicted chance of 5-year survival <90%.
Pretreatment Clinical Evaluation
Pretreatment evaluation included a physical examination; chest radiography; computed tomography

2735

(CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; bilateral
bone marrow biopsy and aspiration; and an optional
gallium scan or positron emission tomography
(PET). In addition, blood was drawn for serum
chemistry analysis, a complete blood count with differential analysis, measurement of serum b2-microglobulin, and flow cytometric analysis of lymphocyte
membrane-surface markers.

Pathologic Analysis
We reviewed all pathologic materials and performed
fine-needle aspiration in recurrent, diseased, lymph
nodes to confirm the diagnosis and classification
using the World Health Organization system.12 All biopsy specimens from which the original diagnosis
was made were reassessed for cyclin D1 expression
by sectioning of fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue.
Tests for other B-cell and T-cell markers, most commonly CD5 and CD20, were also performed. Bone
marrow and peripheral blood specimens were analyzed by flow cytometry. A classic polymerase chain
reaction technique was used to detect the presence
of t(11;14)(q13;q32), which involves the major translocation cluster for the bcl-1 locus, as previously
described.13 In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was used to assess specimens for the
presence of the 11q13 and 11q14 break points.14 The
diagnosis of MCL in each patient in this study was
based on the presence of compatible morphologic
and immunophenotypic findings along with the
expression of cyclin D1 presence of t(11;14)(q13;q32).
Endoscopic biopsy specimens from affected sites in
the gastrointestinal tract were labeled and assessed
separately. For each patient in this study believed to
have gastrointestinal tract involvement of MCL, at
least 1 (usually 2 and rarely 3) biopsy specimen was
assessed immunohistochemically for the presence of
CD5, CD20, and cyclin D1 in fixed, paraffin-embedded, tissue sections. For patients without lymphnode biopsy specimens, we made tissue diagnosis by
examining gastrointestinal, bone marrow, or peripheral blood specimens.
Chemotherapy
The treatment scheme was as follows: Cycle 1 (rituximab plus hyper-CVAD) was a 21-day cycle, administered on either an outpatient or inpatient basis,
consisting of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on
Day 1, followed by cyclophosphamide at a dose of
300 mg/m2 per dose given intravenously over 3 hours
every 12 hours for 6 doses on Days 2, 3, and 4.
Mesna was started 1 hour before the start of cyclophosphamide, at a dose of 600 mg/m2 intravenously
and was given over 24 hours daily on Days 2, 3, and

4, with the infusion completed 12 hours after administration of the last dose of cyclophosphamide.
Twelve hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide, doxoribicin at a dose of 16.6 mg/m2 was given
by continuous intravenously infusion over 24 hours
daily on Days 5, 6, and 7. Vincristine at a dose of 1.4
mg/m2 (maximum absolute dose, 2 mg) was given
by intravenously infusion 12 hours after the last dose
of cyclophosphamide and was repeated on Day 12 of
the cycle. Dexamethasone at a 40-mg absolute dose
was given orally or intravenously on Days 2 to 5 and
12 to 15 of the cycle. Patients with evidence of peripheral blood involvement (as determined by flow
cytometric analysis at the time of initial presentation) may have had their first dose of rituximab
delayed or omitted at the discretion of the clinician
when they were believed to be at risk for tumor-lysis
syndrome or cytokine-release syndrome. Prophylaxis
for each course included granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) at 5 lg/kg subcutaneously, valacyclovir at 500 mg orally, fluconazole at 100 mg
orally, and ciprofloxacin at 500 mg orally twice a day,
all given daily for 10 days starting 24 to 36 hours after the end of the infusion of doxorubicin.
Cycle 2 (rituximab plus methotrexate-cytarabine)
was a 21-day cycle given on an inpatient basis and
consisted of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on
Day 1, followed on Day 2 by methotrexate at a dose
of 200 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2
hours and then methotrexate at a dose of 800 mg/m2
by constant intravenously over 22 hours. Before
methotrexate administration began, the patient’s
urine was alkalinized to a pH of 6.8 or higher and
kept at this level until the methotrexate was cleared
from the blood. For patients with an initial serum
creatinine level >1.5 mg/dL, the dose of methotrexate was decreased by 50%. In patients with evidence
of third spacing of fluids, the fluid was tapped completely or, when this was not possible, rituximab plus
hyper-CVAD was repeated for the next cycle until the
third spacing resolved (this situation was rare). Cytarabine was given at 3000 mg/m2 per dose over 2
hours every 12 hours for 4 doses on Days 3 and 4 of
the cycle. The cytarabine dose was automatically
reduced to 1000 mg/m2 in patients older than 60
years and in those with a serum creatinine level >1.5
mg/dL. A 1% ophthalmic solution of prednisolone,
given at a rate of 2 drops in each eye 4 times daily,
was started on Day 3 at the start of cytarabine infusion and was continued for 7 days to prevent chemical conjunctivitis. Folinic acid (citrovorum factor)
rescue therapy (50 mg) was given orally 12 hours after the infusion of methotrexate was completed, and
then 15 mg orally every 6 hours for 8 doses. Serum

methotrexate levels were checked at 24 and 48 hours
after the end of the infusion, and the dose of folinic
acid was increased to 100 mg intravenously every 3
hours when the serum level was either >1 lM (at 24
hours) or >0.1 lM (at 48 hours). Prophylaxis given
with Cycle 2 was otherwise similar to that given with
Cycle 1. The use of erythropoietin was permitted
throughout therapy.

Evaluation During and After Treatment
The following tests were performed every 2 cycles:
CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; gallium scan
or PET, and bilateral bone marrow biopsy with unilateral aspiration. To confirm CR, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed,
with biopsies performed randomly. Upon completion
of therapy, patients underwent the same studies
(except for gallium scan or PET and endoscopies) every 3 months during the first year, every 4 months
during the second year, every 6 months during the
third and fourth years, and yearly thereafter.
Total Number of Chemotherapy Courses
Patients who achieved a CR after the first 2 cycles (1
rituximab plus hyper-CVAD and 1 rituximab plus
methotrexate with cytarabine) received 4 more
cycles, for a total of 6 cycles. Patients who achieved
a partial response (PR) after 2 cycles and a complete
remission after 6 cycles received 2 more cycles, for a
total of 8 cycles. Patients with evidence of disease
after 6 cycles were removed from the study. Patients
whose disease was responding could be referred at
any time during treatment for consolidation with
stem-cell transplantation.
Dose Adjustment due to Toxicity
Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity required a 1-doselevel decrease of the offending drug.
Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity was discussed
with the principal investigator on a case-by-case basis, with options ranging from dose level reduction to
the patient’s removal from the study. Grade 3 or 4
hematologic toxicity during the nadir of each cycle
did not require dose adjustments. Instead, doses of
myelotoxic drugs were adjusted according to the
patients’ blood counts on Day 21 of the cycle as follows: a platelet count between 75,000/lL and
100,000/lL, or an ANC between 750/lL and 1000/lL
warranted a delay in the treatment until the counts
recovered to >100,000 platelets/lL and >1000 ANC/
lL, without a decrease in the dose; however, when
the platelet count was <75,000/lL or the ANC was
<750/lL, then therapy was delayed until the platelet
count increased to 100,000/lL and the ANC to 1000/lL,

and the next similar regimen was administered at a
1-dose-level reduction of the myelotoxic drugs.

Response Criteria
Response was assessed according to standard International Workshop Criteria.15 Refractory disease was
defined as achievement of less than a partial
response or a persistent partial response or progression with additional cycles or appearance of a new
lesion during therapy. Treatment failure was defined
as recurrence or progression of disease, death due to
disease or toxic effects, or death due to treatmentrelated second malignancies.
Statistical Methods
Patients who underwent consolidation therapy with
stem-cell transplantation were censored for the failure-free survival analysis. The Fisher exact test was
used to test for associations between CR and patient
characteristics. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit
method was used to estimate both failure-free survival and overall survival (OS).16 The log-rank test17
was used to test for differences in failure-free survival
and OS between groups of patients aggregated
according to several variables, age, presence or absence of bone marrow involvement, presence or
absence of any amount of peripheral blood involvement (as judged by morphologic assessment only),
blastoid or other cytology, pretreatment serum levels
of b2-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), presence or absence of an enlarged spleen by
CT as judged by the radiologist, and International
Prognostic Index score for aggressive non-Hodgkin
lymphoma.18 A P < .05 was deemed statistically significant. High b2-microglobulin level was defined as
a b2-microglobulin level 3 mg/L, and high LDH
was defined as an LDH level >upper normal range,
or 618 U/L. All tests were 2-sided. Patients who

Thirty-one patients with relapsed or refractory MCL
were enrolled in this prospective trial. Two were lost
to follow-up, leaving 29 evaluable for response and
toxicity. The patients’ median age was 63 years
(range, 45-78 years), and the male:female ratio was
5:1.

Treatment History
Tables 1 and 2 show prior therapies and response,
respectively. The median number of prior regimens
was 1 (range, 1-5 prior regimens). Most patients had
received a doxorubicin-containing regimen or a
rituximab-containing regimen. First-line therapies
were as follows: CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxoribicin, vincristine, prednisone) with or without rituximab or radiotherapy (17 patients); HyperCVAD or
MA (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin,
dexamethasone, methotrexate, cytarabine) alternating with stem-cell transplantation (1 patient);
HyperCVAD/MA with rituximab (2 patients); PROMACE/CYTABOM (prednisone, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cytarabine, bleomycin,
vincristine, methotrexate, folinic acid) followed by
stem-cell transplantation (1 patient); fludarabine and
cyclophosphamide (1 patient); fludarabine (1
patient); FND (fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone) with rituximab (1 patient); CVP (rituximab,
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) with or
without rituximab (3 patients); and rituximab followed by bexxar (1 patient). Overall, including frontline and subsequent therapies, 4 patients had
previously received rituximab plus hyper-CVAD alternating with rituximab plus methotrexate-cytarabine,
and 5 patients had a disease relapse after undergoing
autologous stem-cell transplantation. Responses to
the previous treatment included CR in 10 (35%)
patients, PR in 7 (24%) patients, and no response or
progression in 12 (41%) patients.

Response to Salvage Rituximab Plus Hyper-CVAD
Alternating With Rituximab Plus Methotrexate-Cytarabine
Results of this trial are summarized in Table 3. The
median number of cycles received was 5 (range, 1-7
cycles), with an overall response rate (ORR) of 93%
(45% CR or CR unconfirmed [CRu] and 48% PR). All
5 patients whose disease was resistant to the previous treatment experienced a response (1 CR, 4 PR),
and both patients whose disease did not change in
response to prior therapy also experienced a
response (2 PRs). We evaluated the 14 patients whose
current response was classified as PR and found that
in 4 of them, this was the best response ever
achieved; another 5 patients were referred for stemcell transplantation while the tumor was still
responding. Nine of 29 (31%) of the patients underwent consolidation therapy with nonmyeloablative
stem-cell transplantation. Reasons for no transplantation in order of frequency included age (7
patients), no insurance (3 patients), less than a partial response (3 patients), patient refusal (3 patients),
and lack of compatible donor (2 patients). One
patient had a heart attack and another patient’s physician chose not to offer transplantation.
No pretreatment variable (number of prior
chemotherapy regimens, response to previous regimens, pretreatment serum levels of b2-microglobulin
or LDH, or age) was associated with achievement of
a CR. There was no response or duration of response
difference by intensity of prior therapy received. Two
patients received radioimmunoconjugates as 1 of
their prior therapies; 1 patient tolerated well the current regimen, and another patient developed delays
in therapy and infections but was able to proceed to
stem-cell transplantation.

DISCUSSION
We previously reported results of a treatment with a
novel combination of a monoclonal antibody and
intense chemotherapy, in which rituximab plus
hyper-CVAD was alternated with rituximab plus
methotrexate-cytarabine in newly diagnosed patients
with aggressive MCL.10 The rates of overall response
and complete response to this regimen, when administered as first-line therapy, were 97% and 87%,
respectively, and at 3 years, the median failure-free
survival had not been reached. We, therefore,
decided to test this regimen in the more challenging
setting of relapsed or refractory MCL.
Patients accrued on the current trial showed an
excellent overall response rate of 93% and, more
importantly, a CR or CRu rate of 45%, thus potentially making more patients eligible for consolidation
with stem-cell transplantation than was possible
when we used standard therapies.
Our sample of patients is representative of the
population of patients with relapsed MCL, in that
they previously received doxorubicin-containing
chemotherapy, mostly in combination with the
monoclonal antibody rituximab. Furthermore, 4
patients had previously received a similar intense
regimen, and 5 patients had disease relapse after

undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation.
The finding that these patients responded to our regimen supports the efficacy of the combination.
Other salvage therapies have resulted in CR rates
of 9% to 80% and PR rates of 21% to 80% (Table 5).
(It should be noted that the higher response rates
were obtained in studies with only 5 patients.) Combining our intense regimen with other targeted therapies that do not have overlapping toxic effects may
further improve outcomes, but this hypothesis
remains to be tested. The final treatment recommendation for a patient with a recurrence will depend on
his or her potential for consolidation with stem-cell
transplantation and his or her performance status.
No variable predicted CR, possibly because of
the regimen’s effectiveness. However, our analysis of
response was confounded because a portion of the
patients with PR underwent stem-cell transplantation
while they were still responding to the regimen.
Assessment of the relation between pretreatment
prognostic variables and failure-free survival was
similarly limited.
Hematologic toxicity in the current study was
frequent, as is expected for a regimen of such intensity, but only 11% of the cycles were associated with
neutropenic fever, and there were no deaths due to
toxicity. No patient has developed myelodysplasia or
acute leukemia, a complication that has been
reported in other trials with a similar regimen.10

The high response rates achieved with rituximab
plus hyper-CVAD alternating with rituximab plus methotrexate-cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL lead us to conclude that this regimen is an
option for induction therapy before stem-cell transplantation. The data also suggest that this regimen will
improve rates of long-term survival in such patients.
