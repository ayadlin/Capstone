Abstract
Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase found in a complex
(mTORC1) that enables macromolecular synthesis and cell growth and is implicated
in cancer etiology. The rapamycin-FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12) complex
allosterically inhibits mTORC1. In response to stress, p53 inhibits mTORC1 through
a separate pathway involving cell signaling and amino acid sensing. Thus, these
different mechanisms could be additive. Here we show that p53 improved the ability
of rapamycin to: 1) extend mouse life span, 2) suppress ionizing radiation (IR)induced senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and 3) increase the levels
of amino acids and citric acid in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. This additive
effect could have implications for cancer treatment since rapamycin and p53 are
anti-oncogenic.

INTRODUCTION

reduced cancer in kidney transplant patients [6, 7] and
mouse cancer models [8-13]. Dietary rapamycin also
ameliorated general aging in wild type mice for most [4,
14-17], but not all studies [18]. Rapamycin also extended
life span for lower organisms that do not die from cancer
suggesting that rapamycin suppresses general aging
in addition to cancer [19]. Thus, rapamycin appears to
suppress mTORC1-mediated oncogenesis and possibly
general aging.
p53 is a transcription factor with broad biological
function [20] that is best known for suppressing tumors in
humans [21, 22] and mice [23, 24] by inducing cell cycle
arrest, apoptosis and senescence in response to a variety of

Rapamycin is a naturally occurring antifungal
compound produced by bacteria. It forms a complex with
FKBP12 that allosterically inhibits primarily mTORC1
[1, 2]. mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase found in
two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1
coordinates cell growth and metabolism in response
to environmental stresses, nutrient and energy levels,
growth factors and other conditions [3]. Rapamycin
extends life span of wild type mice [4], possibly through
cancer suppression since mTORC1 signaling is often
dysregulated in cancer cells [5]. In addition, rapamycin

Other cancers include sarcomas (leiomyo-, rhabdo-, hemangio-, and osteo-), hepatocellular carcinoma, carcinoma, primitive
neuroectodermal tumor, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and a few unidentified neoplasms. Liver defects include biliary duct
hyperplasia, colangiohepatitis, hepatitis, cystic liver, lipidosis, necrosis, thrombus, and focal hepatocellular alteration. Low

stresses [25]. In response to stress, p53 inhibits mTORC1
[26, 27] by inducing transcription of Sestrin 1 and Sestrin
2 that activates AMP-responsive protein kinase (AMPK)
to phosphorylate the mTOR inhibitor, tuberous sclerosis 2
(TSC2) [28] and by negatively regulating the amino acidsensing pathway through modulation of Gator2 [29] or as
RagA/B guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs)
[30]. p53 also induced PTEN/PIP3/AKT to decease
mTORC1 activity [31]. Thus, p53 suppresses mTORC1driven cell growth in response to cellular stresses like
DNA damage.
Rapamycin could have an additive effect with p53 to
suppress mTORC1. This possibility is especially important
since most cancers are dysfunctional for p53 [32]. In
support, p53-mutant mice exhibited increased mTOR
activity in some, but not all tissues [33]. Yet, rapamycin
extended the life span of p53+/- [10] and p53-/- [11] mice
when added to the drinking water or administered in
nanoformulated micelles (Rapatar), respectively. These
latter results are inconsistent with the notion that p53
regulates mTORC1. However, the impact p53 dose has
on rapamycin activity was not assessed in these studies.
p53 dose could be important since p53+/- mice exhibit
haploinsufficiency as demonstrated by tumors that
maintained wild type p53 function [34]. Furthermore,
increasing the dose of enterically encapsulated rapamycin
(eRapa) from 14 ppm to 42 ppm proportionately enhanced
mouse life span [35] and suppressed intestinal adenomas
[9]. Thus, the pharmacological concentration of rapamycin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

could be important with regard to p53 gene dose or p53
activity.
In this study, we report three observations that
support an additive relationship between p53 and
rapamycin in mammals. First, p53 enabled rapamycindriven life span extension in mice. Second, p53 facilitated
rapamycin-mediated SASP reduction in human cells
that were made senescent by IR. Third, p53 enhanced
rapamycin-induced elevation of amino acids and citric
acid in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Thus, p53
augments rapamycin.

We tested the possibility that p53 and rapamycin
would have an additive effect at influencing mouse life
span since both suppress tumors to extend life span.
Mice with varying p53 levels (p53-/-, p53+/-, p53+/+) were
generated using p53+/- breeding pairs (129XC57Bl-6J)
[23]. Same-sex littermates were housed together (5 per
cage) independent of genotype. Mice were fed chow
containing empty Eudragit capsules (control) or capsules
containing 14 ppm eRapa, the concentration previously
shown to extend lifespan, delay tumor-related death,

cerebral function [4, 8, 9, 14, 16, 17, 36]. These treatments
were started at approximately 8.5 weeks of age (median

naturally or were sacrificed when moribund (unresponsive,
dehydrated and immobile). At the time of death, the serum

rapamycin concentration was greater in eRapa-fed mice
(range 0.59 – 7.13 ng/ml, mean 2.57 +/- 1.98 ng/ml, 25
mice observed) than control-fed mice (range 1 – 1.25 ng/
ml, mean 1.19 +/- 0.11 ng/ml, 17 mice observed). Most
likely some eRapa-fed mice had low serum rapamycin
concentrations because they had stopped eating due to
their moribund condition and since blood levels were
higher in healthy mice fed 14 ppm eRapa in a previous
study (32 - 51 ng/ml) [9].
p53 genotype influenced rapamycin-mediated life
span extension. eRapa did not significantly benefit p53-/mice (Figure 1), which had median survival times (male
+ female) of 198.5 and 192 days for control- and eRapafed mice, respectively (p=0.2410). By contrast, eRapa
extended the median survival of p53+/- (520 to 582 days,
p=0.0522) and p53+/+ mice (681 to 802.5 days, p=0.0013).
eRapa improved median survival more for p53+/- females
compared to p53+/- males (15.5% vs. 13.7% increase) and
more for p53+/+ females compared to p53+/+ males (20.9%
vs. 11.6% increase), similar to previous reports [4, 35].
The p53 gene dose appears to directly correlate with
rapamycin’s effectiveness at extending mouse life span.
Chronic eRapa treatment did not significantly
change tumor incidence in p53-deficient mice. Necropsies
were performed on moribund mice after sacrifice or soon
after natural death. Potential tumor masses and abnormal
tissues were analyzed. Cancer, mostly lymphoma, was
the major pathology identified at the time of death for all
genotypes (Table 1). With control chow, p53-/- mice had
a higher lymphoma incidence than p53+/- or p53+/+ mice
(70% vs. 59% and 53%, respectively). With eRapa chow,
there was a lower trend in the incidence of lymphoma in
p53-/- mice but corresponding higher trend in the incidence
of sarcomas (including leiomyoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,
hemangiosarcoma and osteosarcoma); there was a similar
but less pronounced trend in p53+/- mice. Very little change
was observed in wild type p53+/+ mice, similar to a report
that showed eRapa had only a minor effect on tumor
multiplicity or burden in genetically heterogenous mice
[35].

chemokines and together support cancer development and
progression, and might also promote aging [40].
We examined the ability of p53 and rapamycin
to influence the SASP in four different normal human
diploid fibroblast cell strains. We assayed the levels of
three different cytokines indicative of a SASP response
(IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1α). For comparison we assayed levels
of a cytokine that is not part of the SASP (IL-5). To
study the effects of p53, we expressed in cells the genetic
suppressor element 22 (GSE), a peptide that prevents p53
tetramerization and inactivates function [41]. Using this
approach, we observed the impact of p53 on IR-induced
geroconversion for cells exposed to rapamycin.
First we analyzed the impact of IR on these human
cells. There was a very low level of expression of SASPassociated cytokines without IR exposure (Pre). As
expected, IR increased the levels of SASP cytokines,
but not IL-5, regardless of GSE22 expression (Figure 2,
compare Pre vs IR). Thus, IR induced a SASP response
as expected.
Second we analyzed the impact of p53 activity
on the SASP. As expected [38], GSE22 significantly
enhanced the SASP response for all cells and SASP
cytokines (Figure 2, compare grey to pink bars) with a
single possible exception (IL1α, HCA2 cells). Thus, p53
suppressed the SASP, consistent with the notion that p53
is a gerosuppressor under these conditions.
Third, we analyzed the impact of rapamycin on
the SASP of irradiated cells without and with GSE22
expression. Rapamycin significantly suppressed the
SASP for all cells, regardless of p53 status (Figure 2
compare grey vs black bars and pink vs red bars). Yet
in every comparison, rapamycin suppressed the SASP
to a greater extent in p53 competent cells (Figure 2,
compare black and red bars). In most cases, rapamycin
only decreased the SASP of GSE22-expressing cells to
levels of irradiated untreated wild type cells. Thus, p53
augmented the effectiveness of rapamycin in reducing the
SASP. This observation suggests p53 enables rapamycin
and is consistent with the mouse life span studies.

We tested the possibility that p53 and rapamycin
would have an additive effect at suppressing characteristics
of cellular senescence, a process that limits cell growth
[37]. Cellular senescence helps prevent the proliferation
of potential cancer cells and is therefore, anti-oncogenic.
Yet it also promotes the senescence-associated secretory
phenotype (SASP) that can increase cancer risk. The
SASP is a collection of secreted factors characteristic of
senescent cells that accompanies growth arrest [38] and
is conserved between human and mouse cells [39]. These
factors include growth factors, proteases, cytokines and

We tested the possibility that p53 and rapamycin
would have an additive effect at altering cell metabolism
since both the p53 and mTORC1 pathways are responsive
to and influenced by the metabolic status of cells [3, 42].
Therefore, we measured metabolic parameters in p53+/+
and p53-/- mouse ES cells [43] exposed to rapamycin. We
chose ES cells because they are similar to cancer stem
cells. Even though ES cells are primary, they are also
pluripotent and immortal [44]. As such, ES cells exhibit
self-renewal and are oncogenic. Furthermore, like many
cancer cells, they have a high mitotic index and exhibit

enhanced glycolysis (the Warburg effect) [45-48]. In ES
cells, p53 activates genes associated with differentiation
but suppresses genes associated with ES/iPS cell status
in response to ionizing radiation [43]. Therefore, ES
cells were used to assess the potential additive effect of
rapamycin dose in p53+/+ and p53-/- cells.
Metabolic profiling was performed on mouse
ES cells exposed to physiologically relevant doses of
rapamycin, as determined by a proliferation curve that
determined the effect of rapamycin on ES cell proliferation

(Figure 3A). Rapamycin elevated the cellular levels of
eight amino acids and p53 augmented this enhancement
(Figure 3B-I). mTOR signaling is responsive to amino
acid levels, which are critical for protein translation [49,
50]. Rapamycin can elevate amino acid levels by elevating
autophagy and promoting amino acid import by regulating
expression of amino acid transporters such as Snat3 [51].
A similar result was seen for citric acid (Figure 3J). Citric
acid is important to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, consistent
with a role for p53 in promoting mitochondrial respiration

span of p53+/+ mice, and to a lesser degree p53+/- mice, but
failed to extend the life span of p53-/- mice. By contrast,
Rapatar (rapamycin in nanoformulated micelles) extended
the life span of p53-/- mice (p53+/- and p53+/+ mice were
not reported) [11]. Mice exposed to Rapatar appeared to
have higher serum levels than mice fed 14 ppm eRapa.
For example, Rapatar exposure via IV or PO resulted in
>100 ng/ml blood rapamycin for 4 hours after treatment or
~200 ng/ml blood rapamycin for 8 hours after treatment,
respectively. By comparison, the mean blood rapamycin
concentration for our mice fed 14 ppm eRapa was 2.57
+/- 1.98 ng/ml and the maximum concentration was 7.13
ng/ml. These values might be low since we analyzed only
moribund mice but in another one of our studies using 14
ppm eRapa the blood concentration was typically 32 – 51
ng/ml for healthy mice [9]. Thus, increased rapamycin
concentrations appeared to overcome a defect in p53
consistent with the notion that p53 and rapamycin are
additive for extending mouse life span.

[42, 52]. Thus, p53 augments rapamycin-mediated
elevation of amino acid and citric acid levels in ES cells.

DISCUSSION
We provide three lines of evidence that support
the notion that p53 and rapamycin are additive. First,
p53 enabled eRapa to extend life span in mice. Second,
p53 facilitated the ability of rapamycin to suppress the
IR-induced SASP in human cells. Third, p53 enabled
rapamycin to elevate amino acid and citric acid levels in
mouse ES cells. Thus, there appears to be an augmentative
relationship between p53 and rapamycin.
We suggest that p53 and rapamycin blunt mTORC1
activity through different pathways to result in this
additive relationship (Figure 4). Previous publications
support this possibility. Rapamycin/FKBP12 destabilizes
the mTOR complex [1] while p53 induces transcription
of Sestrin 1 and 2 to activate AMPK/TSC2 inhibition of
mTOR [28]. Thus, our results are consistent with these
separate modes of action to blunt mTORC1 since we find
that p53 and rapamycin have an additive effect in three
separate experiments. Even though p53 and rapamycin
appear to suppress mTOR through distinct pathways, it
still remains possible that rapamycin is partly dependent
on p53 for its full effect on mTOR and therefore they are
not strictly additive..

p53 and rapamycin are integrated to affect SASP
p53 appears to facilitate two distinct biological
outcomes that first induce, but then suppress cellular
senescence [27]. The first biological outcome is a
temporary cell cycle arrest (a reversible quiescent state) in
response to stress [27, 53]. For example, p53 rapidly arrests
cells in response to DNA damage and p53 is necessary for
cellular senescence in DNA repair-defective cells [54].
Thus, the p53 mediated DNA damage response appears
to promote cellular senescence in response to genotoxic
stress [55]. However, this arrest is not senescence [56],
but likely an intermediate step to senescence [57, 58].
While cells are arrested or in a quiescent state, p53
might actually inhibit cellular senescence [59, 60]. This
possibility is consistent with our observation that p53
suppressed IR-induced SASP. p53 could suppress SASP
by negatively regulating mTORC1 in response to stress

p53 and rapamycin are integrated to affect mouse
life span
Compared to wild type, mice deficient for p53 were
cancer prone [23], whereas mice that overexpress p53
were cancer resistant [24]. Rapamycin could suppress
oncogenesis to extend the life span of wild type mice. In
support of this possibility, 14 ppm eRapa extended the life
span of several cancer-prone mouse models with wild type
p53 [8, 9]. In this study, 14 ppm eRapa extended the life

[26, 27]. To support this possibility, mTORC1 drives p53arrested cells into a permanent senescent state [61] and
our data are consistent with these results since rapamycin
augmented p53 suppression of the IR-induced SASP.
The p53 + rapamycin-mediated reduction of SASP could
suppress cancer [62]. A reduced SASP could also impact
aging since the elimination of senescent cells ameliorated
a variety of age-related pathologies in an early aging
mouse model [63] and since eRapa ameliorated aging in
wild type mice [4, 14-17]. Rapamycin also extended life
span of lower organisms that do not develop cancer [19].
Thus, p53 induces biological outcomes both necessary
(cell cycle arrest) and antagonistic (reduced SASP) to
cellular senescence that could impact cancer and aging.

appear to have an additive effect to inhibit mTORC1. This
contention is relevant to the use of mTORC1 inhibitors
[69] as anti-cancer therapeutics since p53 is mutated
or dysfunctional in most cancers [32]. Taking this into
account, mTORC1 inhibitors might be most effective
early in the oncogenic process, before p53 is mutated.
Our previous results support this possibility since we
found that eRapa suppressed the development of tumors
with wild type p53 [8, 9]. High levels of mTORC1
inhibitor might be needed to overcome cancer with p53null mutations. Yet for those p53-dysfunctional cancers
that have a functional p53 protein, mTORC1 inhibitors
coupled with p53 enablers such as nutlin [53] could be
a powerful combination allowing a lower dose for each
(Figure 4).

p53 and rapamycin affect amino acid levels

materials and Methods

Although the p53 DDR (growth arrest, senescence
and apoptosis) has been extensively studied, recent results
suggest that other p53 activities can suppress cancer, in
particular those that affect cellular metabolism [64]. To
that end, we performed metabolic profiling of p53+/+ and
p53-/- ES cells exposed to rapamycin. Previously, removal
of amino acids was shown to suppress mTORC1, whereas
an autophagy-mediated increase in amino acids was shown
to reactivate mTORC1, thus, establishing a feedback loop
[49, 65, 66]. We found that p53 enabled rapamycin to
increase amino acid levels in ES cells. These results are
consistent with the cancer-suppressive role of autophagy
[67] and p53’s influence on metabolism [42] with the
general outcome of antagonizing mTORC1 activity and
enhancing rapamycin effectiveness.
Autophagy also promotes recycling of damaged
organelles in response to nutrient depletion, which is
important for cell survival, and may be anti-aging owing to
the degradation of damaged organelles [3]. The increase in
amino acid levels promoted by rapamycin (and augmented
by p53) might be the result of mTORC1 regulation of
amino acid import via increased levels of transporters such
as SNAT3 [51]. In this vein, p53 tumor suppression was
shown to involve cell death via ferroptosis independent of
its DNA damage response [68], which involved increased
ROS that was controlled by expression of SLC7A11 (a
cysteine/glutamate antiporter). Rapamycin-dependent
alterations of citric acid levels might also be part of a
similar cell survival response. Further unraveling the
complex regulatory relationships between mTORC1 and
p53 in cancer and aging will be an important goal of future
studies.

Mice and lifespan determination
All mouse procedures were carried out in accordance
with The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and approved by the institutional IACUC. p53+/mice [23] were bred in-house to generate the p53+/+, p53+/and p53-/- littermates for testing eRapa. Littermates or
closely age-matched animals of the same sex were housed
together regardless of genotype. Genotyping was done
as previously described [23]. The mice were allowed to
live their normal lifespan and were sacrificed only when
moribund (immobile and unable to reach the water bottle).

Rapamycin and control diets
Mice were started on control chow or chow
containing microencapsulated rapamycin at approximately
8.5 weeks of age (median age 61 days for eudragit and
rapamycin with a range of 45-73 days for eudragit and
45-72 days for eRapa). Rapamycin chow contained
microencapsulated rapamycin at a concentration of 14 mg/
kg food (14 ppm), which provides a dose of approximately
2.24 mg of rapamycin per kg of body weight. The control
diet was identical but with empty capsules. Diets were
prepared by TestDiet, Inc. (Richmond, IN), using Purina
5LG6 as the base [4].

Rapamycin blood levels
Measurement of rapamycin levels in the blood was
performed by HPLC-tandem MS as previously described
[4]. Blood was obtained from moribund mice prior to
sacrifice when possible.

Therapeutic potential
Our results support the previous observations
that p53 and rapamycin antagonize mTORC1 through
separate modes of action. As such p53 and rapamycin

mobile phase A, 5% acetonitrile in water containing 20
mM ammonium acetate and 20 mM ammonium hydroxide,
pH 9.45; mobile phase B, acetonitrile; flow rate, 400 μL/
min; gradient, 85% B to 1% B over 10 minutes and held at
1% B for 10 minutes. Data-dependent MS/MS scans were
performed with one full scan followed by 6 MS/MS scans
in the HCD collision cell with normalized collision energy
(NCE) of 35 arbitrary units. Both positive and negative
ion detection were performed through at 70,000 resolution
(m/z 300). Progenesis CoMet (Nonlinear Dynamics) was
used to process the raw data files to detect the metabolites
that exhibit significant differences in the intensity among
the different groups. Peak alignment and integration was
performed and the relative abundance was generated
for each metabolite among different sample types. The
metabolites were identified with accurate mass through
Metlin databases searching using a 5-ppm mass tolerance
and manual interpretation of the MS/MS fragment
patterns. The comparison with the retention times with
commercially available standards was also performed for
further confirmation.

Fixed tissues (in 10% neutralized formalin) were
embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm and stained
with hematoxylin-eosin. Diagnosis was determined as
previously described by the Pathology core of the Barshop
Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies [70-73].

Cell culture and proliferation assays
Primary human fibroblasts HCA2, BJ, WI38 and
IMR90 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS (Corning, CellGro). The GSE22 peptide was
expressed and used to inhibit p53 function as previously
described [41]. Cells were treated with 12.5 nmol of
rapamycin (Sigma R0395) or equal volume of DMSO
for 10 days and media were refreshed every 2 days.
Four replicates were assayed for each cell type and each
condition. Mouse p53+/+ and p53-/- embryonic stem cells
were cultured on gelatinized plates without feeder cells,
as previously described [74, 75]. For cell proliferation
assays, cells were plated at 1x104 cells per well in 24-well
plates. After 24 hr, fresh medium with rapamycin (Sigma
R0395) at the indicated concentrations was added to each
well. Cells were allowed to grow for an additional 48 hr
before harvest; relative cell number was determined using
the MTT assay [76]. Six replicates were assayed for each
rapamycin concentration.

SASP quantification
Human primary fibroblasts were exposed to 10 Gy
X-ray or mock irradiation, as previously described [38].
Irradiated cells were cultured for 10 days and control
cells for 48 hours. Cells were harvested and RNA was
extracted. cDNA was synthesized and analyzed by qPCR
using the UPL system (Roche), as previously described
[77]. Primers and probes were as follow:
IL-6: #45 FW 5’-gcccagctatgaactccttct-3’;RV
5’-gaaggcagcaggcaacac-3’
IL-8: #72 FW 5’-agacagcagagcacacaagc-3’;RV
