ABSTRACT
Inhibition of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase1 (PARP1) impairs DNA damage
repair, and early generation PARP1/2 inhibitors (olaparib, niraparib, etc.) have
demonstrated clinical proof of concept for cancer treatment. Here, we describe
the development of the novel PARP inhibitor E7449, a potent PARP1/2 inhibitor
that also inhibits PARP5a/5b, otherwise known as tankyrase1 and 2 (TNKS1
and 2), important regulators of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. E7449 inhibits
PARP enzymatic activity and additionally traps PARP1 onto damaged DNA; a
mechanism previously shown to augment cytotoxicity. Cells deficient in DNA repair
pathways beyond homologous recombination were sensitive to E7449 treatment.
Chemotherapy was potentiated by E7449 and single agent had significant antitumor
activity in BRCA-deficient xenografts. Additionally, E7449 inhibited Wnt/β-catenin
signaling in colon cancer cell lines, likely through TNKS inhibition. Consistent with
this possibility, E7449 stabilized axin and TNKS proteins resulting in β-catenin
de-stabilization and significantly altered expression of Wnt target genes. Notably,
hair growth mediated by Wnt signaling was inhibited by E7449. A pharmacodynamic
effect of E7449 on Wnt target genes was observed in tumors, although E7449
lacked single agent antitumor activity in vivo, a finding typical for selective TNKS
inhibitors. E7449 antitumor activity was increased through combination with MEK
inhibition. Particularly noteworthy was the lack of toxicity, most significantly the
lack of intestinal toxicity reported for other TNKS inhibitors. E7449 represents a
novel dual PARP1/2 and TNKS1/2 inhibitor which has the advantage of targeting
Wnt/β-catenin signaling addicted tumors. E7449 is currently in early clinical
development.

INTRODUCTION

TNKS1 and 2 share high sequence similarity with
PARP1 within their PARP catalytic domains, however
the remainder of the proteins are highly divergent.
Specifically, TNKS1 and 2 contain ankyrin repeats for the
recognition and binding of substrate proteins and a sterile
α-motif (SAM) that mediates protein-protein interaction
and self-oligomerization [25, 26]. In contrast, PARP1
comprises a DNA binding domain containing 2 Zn-finger
motifs, a domain with a nuclear localization signal, and
an auto-modification domain with a BRCT motif [1].
Knockout of genes encoding TNKS1 or 2 individually
results in viable and developmentally normal mice,
whereas inactivation of both genes is embryonic lethal,
analogous to prior findings in PARP1 and 2 knockout
mice [27, 28]. Tankyrases have multiple diverse cellular
functions including regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
and roles in telomere maintenance, mitosis and glucose
uptake [25, 26]. At present, tankyrases are attracting
significant attention as emerging therapeutic targets for
cancer, principally due to their role in Wnt signaling.
Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated
in the development and progression of multiple cancers.
Tankyrase inhibition results in stabilization of axin, a
principal constituent of the β-catenin destruction complex,
and culminates in antagonism of Wnt signaling [29].
Several PARP inhibitors are currently under
evaluation in cancer patients. Phase 3 studies are underway
and most are directed toward patients with BRCA mutant
tumors. In this study, we describe the preclinical profile
and characteristics of E7449, a novel and potent inhibitor
of PARP1/2 and TNKS1/2. In common with earlier
generation PARP1/2 inhibitors e.g. olaparib, niraparib,
veliparib (AbbVie), etc., E7449 displays potent antitumor
activity in BRCA-deficient in vivo models and potentiates
the activity of chemotherapy preclinically. Inhibition
of TNKS1/2 by E7449 is a significant distinction from
traditional inhibitors and the resultant modulation of Wnt/
β-catenin signaling may broaden the potential therapeutic
applications beyond tumors with deficient DNA repair
capacity. Evaluation of E7449 in early clinical studies in
cancer patients is underway [30].

Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases (PARPs) catalyze
the post-translational modification of proteins through
addition of ADP-ribose, using nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide as substrate [1]. The PARP family comprises
17 members, identified through sequence homology to
the PARP1 catalytic domain. PARP1 and 2 and PARP5a
and 5b (also known as tankyrase1 and 2; TNKS1 and 2)
catalyze the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), whereas
the majority of family members incorporate single
ADP-ribose units to substrate proteins [2, 3]. Covalent
modification by the addition of PAR serves to regulate the
function of target proteins, which often include the PARP
enzymes themselves [4]. Large, linear and/or branched
chains of PAR recruit binding proteins and serve as a
scaffold for generation of large protein complexes [5, 6, 7].
PARP family enzymes are involved in many
physiological processes, including cell division, regulation
of transcription, maintenance of telomere integrity,
control of protein degradation, and cell survival and
death [8, 9]. Additional important functions in cellular
stress responses include detection of DNA damage, DNA
repair, response to heat shock, response to unfolded
protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the cytoplasmic
stress response [6, 8, 10, 11]. Discovered more than 40
years ago, PARP1 is the founding member and the best
characterized PARP [12, 13]. It is considered a significant
anticancer target due to its important function in DNA
damage repair and the maintenance of genomic stability
as well as additional functions in transcriptional regulation
and epigenetics [9, 14]. PARP1 is a highly abundant
nuclear enzyme that is recruited to and activated by sites
of DNA damage. PARP2 is similarly mobilized; however
PARP1 activity is responsible for the majority (90–95%)
of PAR generated by genotoxic stress [15, 16]. PARP1
is involved in repair of single strand DNA breaks via the
base excision repair (BER) pathway and non-homologous
end joining (NHEJ) pathways [15, 17]. PARP1 inhibition
in cancers defective in homologous recombination (HR)
repair such as those containing mutations in BRCA1
or BRCA2, leads to effective killing through synthetic
lethality [18, 19]. In addition, preventing DNA repair
through inhibition of PARP1/2 sensitizes tumor cells to
radiotherapy and cytotoxic drugs that damage DNA,
establishing a rationale for using PARP inhibitors as
anticancer agents in combination therapy [14, 20]. Clinical
proof of concept for synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors
in BRCA1/2 mutant breast and ovarian tumors has been
achieved for olaparib (AstraZeneca) and niraparib (Tesaro)
with sustained antitumor activity as monotherapy observed
in patients with advanced disease [21, 22, 23,  24].
Olaparib (Lynparza) gained approval from the FDA
and the European Medicines Agency for use in certain
patients with advanced BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.
Additionally, various PARP inhibitors are under evaluation
as combinatorial therapy in multiple clinical studies.

RESULTS
E7449 inhibits PARP1 and 2 and TNKS1 and 2
E7449 is 8-(isoindolin-2-ylmethyl)-2,9-dihydro3H-pyridazino[3,4,5-de]quinazolin-3-one (Figure 1A,
Supplemental Figure 1 for synthesis scheme); an orally
bioavailable, brain penetrable, small molecule PARP
inhibitor that is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein [31].
Potent inhibition of PARP was observed in a cell free assay
(Trevigen) where PARylation of histones was inhibited by
E7449 with IC50 values of 1.0 and 1.2 nmol/L for PARP1
and 2 respectively (Supplementary Table 1). To examine
selectivity of E7449 for PARP1 and 2, a screen of available
full length recombinant human PARP enzymes was

performed using 32P-NAD+ as substrate and auto-PARylation
as readout [2]. IC50 values of ~2.0 and ~1.0 nmol/L were
obtained for E7449 inhibition of PARP1 and 2 respectively
in this assay (Supplementary Table 1). Significant inhibitory
activity was not observed for PARP3 or PARPs 6–16
(PARP9 and 13 lack activity and PARP4 had minimal signal
in this study, (data not shown)). In contrast, E7449 inhibited
TNKS1 and 2 (PARP5a and 5b) with IC50 values of 50–100
nmol/L (Supplementary Figure 2A, Supplementary Table 1).
Assay of E7449 with the semi-quantitative TNKS1 histone
PARylation assay from Trevigen revealed an average IC50
value of 115 nmol/L for E7449 (Supplementary Table 1,
Supplementary Figure 2B). In this assay the average IC50
value for the selective tankyrase inhibitor XAV939, included
as a positive control, was ~10 nmol/L (Supplementary
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Figure  2B), similar to that previously reported: 11 and 4
nmol/L for TNKS1 and 2 versus 2.194 and 0.114 μmol/L
for PARP1 and 2 respectively [29]. In contrast, the selective
PARP1/2 inhibitor, olaparib (reported IC50 values of 5 and 1
nmol/L for PARP1 and 2 versus 1.5 μmol/L for TNKS1 [32])
did not inhibit tankyrase at the concentrations tested; IC50 >
3,000 nmol/L (Supplementary Figure 2B).

E7449 traps PARP1 onto DNA and affects DNA
repair pathways beyond HR
In addition to catalytic inhibition of PARylation,
mechanistic studies have recently revealed that PARP
inhibitors may act as poisons to trap PARP onto DNA
[33–35]. The PARP-DNA complexes likely interfere with
41309

DNA replication and thus, contribute to cytotoxicity.
In avian B-lymphoblast DT40 cells damaged with the
alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) the
presence of E7449 resulted in binding of PARP1 to
chromatin in a dose responsive manner (Figure 1B).
Trapped PARP was also observed upon incubation of
cells with olaparib (Figure 1C). Minimal PARP trapping
was observed in the absence of MMS or PARP inhibitor
(Figures 1B and 1C).
To further evaluate inhibition by E7449 and
its selectivity for various DNA repair pathways, a
cell proliferation assay was performed in a panel of
32  isogenic DT40 cell lines, in which each line was
deficient in a distinct DNA repair gene [36]. In wild type
DT40 cells E7449 inhibited cell proliferation in a 2 day
assay with an IC50 value of 3.2 μmol/L; this value was
used for normalization of E7449 IC50 values obtained in
mutant cells (Figure 1D, see Supplementary Figure 3 for
representative IC50 curves). Strikingly, DT40 cells lacking
PARP expression appeared significantly resistant to
treatment with E7449, with a 5 fold increase in IC50 versus
parental DT40 cells (Figure 1D). A similar observation was
made with olaparib inhibition (Supplementary Figure 4):
this finding is consistent with the requirement of PARP
for drug cytotoxicity and the PARP trapping activity of
both inhibitors. Notably, resistance to PARP inhibition was
also observed in cells lacking Ku70, a protein required for
NEHJ repair of double-strand DNA breaks. As anticipated,
lines deficient in components of the HR pathway (BRCA1
and 2, CtIP, Rad54, etc.) were most E7449-sensitive, with
IC50 values up to 10 fold lower than those observed in wild
type DT40 (Figure 1D). In addition, greater than 2 fold
sensitization to E7449 was observed in cell lines deficient
in checkpoints (ATM and RAD17), ubiquitin ligase for
post-replication repair (RAD18), components of BER and
nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways; FEN1, POLD,
and POLB, and the RecQ helicase BLM, confirming the
extensive inhibitory activity of E7449 in DNA repair,
outside the narrow definition of HR (Figure 1D). Overall,
the sensitivity profile of E7449 closely resembled that
determined for olaparib (Supplementary Figure 4).

100 mg/kg with TMZ resulted in significantly enhanced
tumor growth inhibition (Figure 2A). The increased
antitumor activity was E7449 dose responsive and was
significant even at the lowest E7449 dose of 10 mg/kg
(Figure 2A). Potentiation of TMZ antitumor therapy was
accompanied by increased toxicity as observed by
decreased body weight in animals treated with the
combination (Figure 2B). No animal lethality occurred
but body weight loss was observed in all 3 combination
groups. All mice recovered weight once treatment was
completed.
Potentiation of platinum agents has also been
reported for PARP1/2 inhibitors [14, 39]. In orthotopic
MX-1 human breast cancer xenografts, treatment with
E7449 enhanced the antitumor activity of carboplatin
(Figure 2C). No antitumor activity was observed in
MX-1 xenografts following treatment with E7449 alone
at 100 mg/kg once daily and administration of a single
dose of carboplatin resulted in only modest antitumor
activity (Supplementary Figures 5A and 5B). Addition
of E7449 resulted in enhanced carboplatin antitumor
activity, but only when administered simultaneously
with, or prior to carboplatin treatment (Figure 2C). E7449
administration 1 day post-carboplatin treatment resulted
in antitumor activity that closely resembled that observed
with carboplatin alone. Combination treatment was well
tolerated with no signs of toxicity or significant body
weight loss observed for any of the treatments (Figure 2D).

Inhibition of PARP activity and growth of BRCA
mutant tumors by E7449
A compelling body of evidence supports the use
of PARP inhibitors in tumors lacking double stranded
DNA repair by HR e.g. BRCA mutant tumors [reviewed
in 14, 15]. To evaluate single agent antitumor activity,
E7449 was assessed in a panel of breast cancer cell lines
in an 8 day proliferation assay. E7449 sensitive and
resistant lines were observed with IC50 values ranging
from ~0.2 to >10 μmol/L (Figure 3A, see Supplementary
Figure 6 for representative IC50 curves). MDA-MB-436,
a triple negative breast cell line that harbors a BRCA1
mutation (5396 +  1G > A in splice donor site of exon
20) was the most sensitive cell line identified. In an
in vivo subcutaneous MDA-MB-436 xenograft model,
administration of E7449 at 30 or 100 mg/kg once daily
for 28 days resulted in statistically significant antitumor
activity (Figure 3B). A dose response was observed, with
greater tumor growth inhibition at the higher 100 mg/kg
dose. Treatment with E7449 at 30 or 100 mg/kg was
well-tolerated without any significant body weight loss
or deaths (data not shown). Pharmacodynamic PARP
inhibition was assessed in tumors following a single dose
of E7449 at 30 or 100 mg/kg (5 mice per group) at various
time points post-dosing from 1 to 36 hours (Figure 3C
and 3D). Considerable variability in PAR levels was

observed in the control (vehicle treated) group of 10 mice,
as previously reported [40]. Treatment with E7449 at
100  mg/kg resulted in significant PARP inhibition that
was sustained for at least 12 hours and recovered to basal
levels within 24 hours (Figure 3D). At the 30 mg/kg dose
significant PARP inhibition was also observed but the
effect was less sustained and partial rebound was observed
within 12 hours (Figure 3C).

various time points from 0.25 to 36 hours post-treatment.
As in the previous study, significant variability in tumor
PAR levels of vehicle-treated mice was noted (Figure 4,
control mice panel). E7449 treatment resulted in
significant PARP inhibition at early time points (0.25 and
1 hour) even at the lowest administered dose of 1 mg/kg
(Figure 4). PARP activity levels were recovered at least
partially to basal levels within 6 hours post-dose of
E7449 at 1 and 3 mg/kg. Increasing E7449 dose resulted
in a more sustained duration of PARP inhibition. At the
highest E7449 dose of 100 mg/kg complete inhibition
was observed up to 12 hours and the rebound in activity
delayed until 24 hours post treatment (Figure 4).

Pharmacodynamic PARP inhibition by E7449

To further interrogate E7449 pharmacodynamic
PARP inhibition a study was conducted in the NCI-H460
lung cancer xenograft model. No antitumor activity was
recorded for E7449 in this model which was selected
for its rapid and consistent tumor growth. Mice were
administered a single E7449 dose from 1 to 100 mg/kg
and tumors were harvested for PAR analysis by ELISA at

tumors. At various timepoints from 1 to 36 hours post-administration, animals were euthanized and tumors harvested. PARP activity in
tumor lysate was assessed through determination of PAR levels, normalized by protein concentration. Mean PAR (ng/mg protein) in control
animals (vehicle-treated) was set to 100% PARP activity and the inhibition of PARP activity for each time point was calculated by using an
average of all control replicates. PAR % of control (mean ± SEM) was calculated from data of 2 experiments assayed in triplicate and each
bar on the graph represents % PAR levels in the tumor tissue from an individual mouse.
ultimately in proteolysis of β-catenin [29]. Studies were
performed to determine if E7449-mediated tankyrase
inhibition could affect Wnt signaling in human colon
cancer SW480 (Wnt active, APC mutant) cells in vitro.
A significant increase in the level of axin2 protein
was observed in cells treated with E7449 (Figure 5A).
Increased axin2 was also observed following treatment
with the selective tankyrase inhibitor XAV939, whereas
axin2 remained at basal levels following treatment with
the selective PARP1/2 inhibitor olaparib (Figure 5A).
Stabilization of axin2 as well as tankyrase proteins

the increase in axin2, E7449 treatment reduced levels
of active (non-phosphorylated) and total β-catenin by
~70 and 50% respectively, versus ~90 and 75% for the
more potent XAV939 (Figures 5B and 5C). In contrast,
β-catenin protein levels remained unchanged in olaparibtreated cells (Figures 5B and 5C). A modest decrease in
Cyclin D1 protein levels was observed following treatment
with E7449 or XAV939, while protein levels were again
unaffected by olaparib treatment (Figure 5D). Together

these data suggest that alterations in Wnt/β-catenin
signaling proteins, mediated by E7449 and XAV939, are
the consequence of tankyrase inhibition and accordingly
were not observed with olaparib, which only weakly
inhibits tankyrase.
In DLD-1 cells (Wnt active, APC mutant) treated
with E7449, similar if less potent effects were observed
on axin2 and cyclin D1; analogous to effects induced by
XAV939, but not olaparib (Supplementary Figures 7C
and 7D). A robust effect on levels of β-catenin was not
observed by western blot for E7449 or XAV939 in this
cell line. In the Wnt inactive human colon cancer RKO
cell line, axin2 and β-catenin were not detected (data not
shown).
Gene expression profiling was performed to measure
the effect of E7449 treatment on expression of genes
involved in Wnt signaling. Expression was measured by
quantitative PCR using a custom-designed array following
E7449 treatment of SW480 cells. Significantly altered
expression of 30 Wnt-related genes was observed following
E7449 treatment. Overall, the gene expression profile
revealed by E7449 treatment closely resembled that obtained
with XAV939 (Figure 6A). E7449-treated DLD-1 cells also
underwent significantly altered expression of 40 Wnt-related
genes and again, the expression heat map closely resembled
that of XAV939 treated-cells (Supplementary Figure 8).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Approximately 45% of genes altered upon E7449 treatment
were common to both cell lines. PARP inhibitors are known
to act as regulators of transcription factors [41]; therefore a
study was conducted to confirm that gene changes observed
were the result of tankyrase inhibition by E7449 and not
PARP1/2 inhibition. SW480 cells were treated with E7449,
XAV939 or olaparib (at 3  μmol/L where olaparib is not
expected to inhibit tankyrases, as compared with 30 μmol/L
in the previous study), and gene expression changes were
measured using the array described above. Expression of
17 Wnt-related genes was significantly altered by at least
one of the 3 compound treatments (Figure 6B). Heat map
expression profiles for E7449 and XAV939 were again
highly comparable and differed considerably from that
of olaparib, whose profile more closely resembled that of
DMSO. Six E7449-responsive genes common to each study
(NOS3, LGR5 and LEF1 up-regulated and NKD1, CYR61
and MMP7, down-regulated) are represented in Figure
6C and 6D. XAV939 treatment also altered expression of
these 6 genes in the same direction, although differences
in the scale of change were observed (Figure 6C and 6D).
In contrast, olaparib treatment had no effect or altered
expression in the opposite direction (NOS3, MMP7),
(Figure  6D) suggesting that the E7449-mediated gene
expression changes are the consequence of tankyrase
inhibition.

effect or altered expression in the opposite direction (D).

inhibition of Wnt signaling in vivo mediated by E7449,
likely through inhibition of tankyrase activity.

Wnt signaling is necessary for hair follicle
development and cycling [42–44]. Re-growth of hair in
mice was investigated to determine if tankyrase inhibition
by E7449 could impact Wnt signaling in vivo. Following
hair removal, C57BL/6 mice were treated with E7449
administered once daily at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg. Within 2
weeks, notable re-growth of hair was observed in vehicletreated mice with only a few small bald patches remaining;
full hair re-growth was observed by Day 21 (Figure 7). In
contrast, hair re-growth was significantly delayed in mice
treated with E7449. A dose response effect was observed
and bald patches remained at Day 21 in mice treated with

Wnt-C59-treated mice revealed significant alteration of
several Wnt-related genes including CAR2, FZD9, LEF1,

also altered in tumors from E7449-treated mice, albeit to
a lesser extent (Figure 8B). Tankyrase inhibition of Wnt
signaling by itself may prove insufficient to achieve tumor
shrinkage; therefore, activity of E7449 was re-assessed in
combination with the MEK inhibitor E6201. Antitumor
activity was enhanced in the combination versus either
single agent alone (Figure 8C, left panel). The addition
of E7449 to E6201 had minimal effect on toxicity as
measured by body weight loss (Figure 8C, right panel).

cells with active Wnt signaling, E7449 treatment altered
expression of Wnt pathway proteins and Wnt-related
genes, and administration to mice prevented re-growth of
hair, a Wnt-dependent pathway. Pharmacodynamic effects
on Wnt signaling were observed in the Wnt1 model, and
co-administration of E7449 with a MEK inhibitor, resulted
in a synergistic antitumor effect, with no significant toxicity.
Dual inhibition of TNKS1/2 and PARP1/2 distinguishes
E7449 from existing PARP inhibitors and may lead to a
distinct spectrum of clinical opportunity; E7449 is currently
in early phase clinical development [30].
E7449 inhibits PARP1 and 2 with a potency
of 1.0 and 1.2 nmol/L; values in a similar range to
those reported for olaparib, niraparib and talazoparib
(BioMarin), with the caveat that different assays were
used for each inhibitor [32, 46, 47]. PARP trapping was
demonstrated for E7449 in DT40 cells in the presence
of the alkylating agent MMS. A dose responsive effect
was observed, however the increase in trapped PARP
appeared minimal alongside the 100 fold increase in
E7449 concentration (Figure 1B), perhaps because
PARP trapping was close to maximal at the lowest
E7449 treatment (0.1 μmol/L), or reflecting the limit of
sensitivity of the assay. The amount of PARP detected
in chromatin complexes was almost identical for E7449
and olaparib. Beyond the similar potency of catalytic
inhibition and PARP trapping by E7449, the dose of
E7449 necessary for sustained PARP inhibition in

DISCUSSION
This report provides the first characterization of a dual
PARP1/2 and TNKS1/2 inhibitor. E7449 is a novel, potent
inhibitor of the DNA repair proteins PARP1 and 2; it traps
PARP onto DNA to augment cytotoxicity and, comparable
to earlier PARP inhibitors it exhibits selectivity for tumor
cells that are deficient in HR repair and other DNA
repair pathway proteins. Single agent antitumor activity
was observed for E7449 in a BRCA mutant xenograft
model, while in combination E7449 potentiated the DNA
damaging effects of chemotherapy in vivo. Additionally,
and in contrast to described clinical PARP inhibitors, E7449
inhibits the PARylation activity of TNKS1/2 at a clinically
relevant dose. Tankyrase is a key regulator of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling, a pathway known to promote tumorigenesis and

tumors and single agent antitumor activity closely
resembles that described for the traditional PARP
inhibitors, olaparib, niraparib, etc. rather than the lower
dosed talazoparib [32, 46, 47].
Data generated in the DT40 cell line panel
where PARP deficient cells were significantly more
resistant to E7449 than wild type cells demonstrate
the requirement of PARP for E7449 activity and also
confirm E7449-mediated PARP trapping to enhance
cytotoxicity. Resistance to E7449 was also observed
in cell lines deficient in NHEJ repair (KU70, PKCS,
and LIGlV) as previously reported for other PARP
inhibitors [35]. Predictably, cell lines that lacked HR
pathway proteins were more sensitive to E7449, and an
increase in susceptibility to E7449 was also observed
in cell lines with deficiency in checkpoint proteins and
well as proteins from several DNA repair pathways,
including BER and NER. The profile of E7449 in the
panel is indistinguishable to that of olaparib, again
demonstrating that the PARP1/2 inhibition properties

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of E7449 closely correlate to those of traditional PARP
inhibitors.
While E7449 closely parallels previously described
inhibitors in terms of PARP inhibition and preclinical
properties, significant divergence arises with respect to
effects on tankyrase activity. E7449 inhibits TNKS1/2
with IC50 values from 50 to 120 nmol/L, a dose considered
clinically relevant [30]. An IC50 value of > 3 μmol/L was
determined for olaparib for TNKS1 inhibition using the
Trevigen assay. Reported IC50 values for tankyrase inhibition
by olaparib, niraparib, and veliparib (various assays) are
at least 5–20 fold higher than that observed for E7449
(1.5 μmol/L, 0.6 μmol/L, and 15 μmol/L, respectively
[32, 46, 25]), and reflect drug concentrations not likely to
be achievable clinically. No data have been reported for
tankyrase inhibition by rucaparib or talazoparib, although
rucaparib binding to the catalytic domain of multiple PARP
family members including tankyrases was described by
Wahlberg et al [48]; no significant binding of TNKS1/2 was
reported for olaparib or veliparib in their study.

While tankyrases perform multiple and varied
cellular tasks including maintenance of telomeres, roles
in mitosis and glucose uptake, the burgeoning interest
in targeting tankyrase for development of anticancer
therapeutics is primarily directed to their role in the
regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling [25, 26]. The
β-catenin destruction complex (composed of APC, axin
(limiting component), and GSK3β) regulates proteolysis of
the transcription factor β-catenin through phosphorylation
and is inactivated during active Wnt signaling; this
leads to accumulation of non-phosphorylated β-catenin
that translocates to the nucleus and transcribes multiple
target genes, including cyclin D1. PARylation of axin by
tankyrase is necessary for its subsequent ubiquitination
by RNF146 and proteasome degradation; inhibition
of tankyrase by XAV939 results in axin and tankyrase
stabilization, enhanced activity of the destruction complex
and ultimately in inhibition of β-catenin-mediated
transcription [25, 29, 49]. Wnt/β-catenin signaling
perturbation was achieved with E7449 treatment in Wntactive colon cancer cells and the profiles generated both by
western blot and in gene expression studies appeared very
similar to that of the selective tankyrase inhibitor XAV939.
Importantly and distinctly, treatment with olaparib which
lacks potent tankyrase inhibition had minimal impact on
Wnt signaling proteins in these in vitro studies, implying
that effects were not PARP1/2-sensitive and were more
likely the result of tankyrase inhibition. Additionally,
E7449 treatment prevented re-growth of hair in mice,
a process that is Wnt signaling dependent [42–44]. We
postulate that E7449 reduces Wnt/β-catenin signaling
by inhibiting tankyrase, thus preventing PARylationdependent axin degradation, and thereby promoting
β-catenin destabilization.
Tankyrase is currently the most highly validated
druggable target in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway; inhibitors
have been shown to reduce signaling and extensive
discovery efforts have resulted in the identification of
multiple tankyrase inhibitors [reviewed in 25, 26]. Of
these, only G007-LK was reported to inhibit tumor
growth as a single agent in certain models [50], while
the majority of tankyrase inhibitors lack antitumor
activity in vivo. Similarly, E7449 treatment resulted in
pharmacodynamic effects on Wnt-target genes in vivo but
these changes in gene expression appeared insufficient to
mediate an antitumor effect in the Wnt1 model as a single
agent. G007-LK has a very narrow therapeutic window
because of intestinal toxicity, an on-target tankyrase
inhibition effect [50]. Dose limiting intestinal toxicity that
produces significant adverse effects is commonly observed
upon inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling [51,  52].
Importantly, no gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in
preclinical studies with E7449 despite evidence of Wnttarget perturbation. Moreover, E7449 has been generally
well tolerated in cancer patients treated to date, with
fatigue (a PARP inhibitor class effect) rather than intestinal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

toxicity identified as the dose-limiting toxicity in a small
phase 1 study [30].
Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been identified as a
potential mediator of resistance to MEK inhibition and
strong synergy has been observed for the combination of
MEK and tankyrase inhibition in KRAS-mutant cancer
cells [50, 53, 54]. Consistent with these findings, when
E7449 was combined with the MEK inhibitor, E6201,
synergistic antitumor activity was observed in the Wnt1
model. E7449 also significantly potentiated the antitumor
effects of temozolomide and carboplatin with tolerable
toxicity, most likely through inhibition of DNA repair
activity of PARP1/2. In addition to a wide range of
chemotherapeutic agents, PARP inhibitors are increasingly
under clinical investigation in combination with targeted
therapies including inhibitors of PI3K, bortezomib,
etc. Co-inhibition of TNKS1/2 by E7449 potentially
increases the range and number of possible, rationally
targeted combinations for this therapy. For example, a
critical role for tankyrase and Wnt/β-catenin signaling
was identified for maintenance of lung cancer cells during
EGFR inhibition and subsequent inhibition of tankyrase
significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of EGFR
inhibitors in NSCLC cells [55]. Testing additional targeted
therapies with E7449 may reveal novel combinations and
indications for further development.
In this study we illustrate the unique properties
of E7449, a multi-targeted drug. We provide evidence
for meaningful inhibition of the DNA repair PARPs,
PARP1/2, in addition to TNKS1/2, key components of
Wnt signaling. Inhibition of multiple anticancer targets
offers the potential for enhanced efficacy and expanded
indications or combination partners, versus a single target
drug. Multi-target agents are common in drug discovery
and promiscuous multi-kinase inhibitors have proved
therapeutically effective anticancer drugs; using this as an
example, we propose that E7449 may possess increased or
broader therapeutic effectiveness through its dual PARP/
TNKS inhibition.

laboratory of Dr. Jun Nakamura, UNC. MX-1 cells were
obtained from National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD).
All other cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained according
to their instructions. For in vivo studies, cells were used
within a short time of receipt from ATCC or cell line
authenticity was verified by STR typing.

(PARP4, 5a and 16), NAD+ incorporation was performed
at 1:5 ratio for 1 h at 25oC. Beads were then re-suspended
in Laemmli sample buffer, heated to 65oC for 10 min,
the beads removed using a magnet, and the supernatant
spotted onto Whatman paper. Samples were analyzed via
phosphorimaging.

PARP and TNKS enzyme assays: catalytic
inhibition and PARP trapping

Proliferation assays were performed in a panel of 32
isogenic DT40 cell lines, in which each line was deficient
in a distinct DNA repair gene [36]. Cells were seeded and
incubated with test compound at various concentrations
for 2–3 days (~ 8 cell cycles). Cell growth was assessed
using XTT (ATCC® Cat# 30–1011K™) and IC50 values
were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 5 software
version 5.02 (Lake Forest, CA). Each experiment was
conducted in duplicate and a minimum of 3 separate
experiments were performed. Human breast cancer cell
lines, HCC1143, HCC70, HCC1806, MDA-MB-436,
T47D, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468,
MDA-MB-453, BT-20 and Hs578T were obtained from
ATCC. For cell line panel assays, cells were maintained
and assayed in RPMI 1640 or DMEM medium containing
10% FBS. For proliferation assays cells were plated at
low density in 96 well plates. E7449 was added at various
concentrations and plates incubated for a total of 8 days;
compound and medium were replenished on day  4.
Cell growth was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo® cell
viability assay (Promega, Cat# G7573). Each experiment
was conducted in duplicate and a minimum of 3 separate
experiments were performed.

Cell lines and proliferation assay

The ability of E7449 to inhibit the activity of
human recombinant PARP1, mouse recombinant PARP2
or human recombinant TNKS1 was determined using
chemiluminescent PARP or tankyrase assay kits from
Trevigen, following the manufacturer’s instructions. IC50
values were determined by non-linear regression using the
GraphPad Prism 5 software version 5.02 (Lake Forest, CA).
DT40 cells [36] were treated with PARP inhibitor
(0.1–10 μmol/L) in combination with 0.05% Methyl
methanesulfonate (MMS, Sigma-Aldrich (Cat# 129925).
Cells were pretreated for 5 min with MMS prior to adding
PARP inhibitor for a further 30 min incubation at 37oC
with gentle shaking. Following treatment, cells were lysed
using the subcellular protein fractionation kit for cells
(Thermo Scientific, Cat# 78840) to obtain the chromatinbound fraction. Chromatin-bound proteins were subjected
to western blot analysis with antibodies against PARP1
(Cell signaling Technology (CST), Cat# 9532), and
histone H3 as control (CST Cat# 3638). Following binding
of appropriate secondary antibodies labeled with IRDye®
(LI-COR), image analysis and quantitation of blots was
performed with Image Studio software for the LI-COR
Odyssey system (version 2.1.10).
GFP-PARPs were expressed in 293F cells
and the auto-PARylation activity of each PARP was
assessed in the presence or absence of E7449 at various
concentrations as in the previously described assay [2].
Briefly, 24 to 48 h after transfection, cells were washed
3x in ice-cold PBS and lysed for 20 min on ice in cell
lysis buffer (CLB: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% TritonX-100,
1 μg/mL leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, PMSF). Lysates
were subject to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 30 min.
Cleared lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4oC with antiGFP antibody (3E6, Life Technologies) and pre-bound
protein A magnetic beads (Millipore). Beads were then
washed 1 × 5 min in CLB, followed by 3 × 10 min washes
in CLB containing 1 M NaCl, and 1 × 5 min wash in PARP
reaction buffer (PRB; 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl,
0.5 mM DTT, 0.1% TritonX-100, 1 μg/mL leupeptin,
aprotinin, pepstatin). NAD+ incorporation reactions
were performed in PRB containing 10 μmol/L NAD+
supplemented with 32P-NAD+ at 1:20 ratio for 30 min
at 25oC. For PARPs with low incorporation signals

Western blot and Gene expression
SW480, DLD-1 (Wnt-dependent) or RKO (Wntindependent) cells were plated in 6-well plates and
incubated overnight. Cells were treated with E7449,
olaparib or XAV939 and incubated for various time
periods prior to processing by SDS PAGE and western blot
analysis. Blots were probed with antibodies to axin 2 (CST
Cat# 2151), total β-catenin (CST Cat# 8480), non-phospho
(active) β-catenin (CST Cat# 8814), cyclin D1 (CST
Cat# 2926, Cat#2978), tankyrase (Abcam Cat# ab13587:
this antibody does not discriminate between tankyrase
1 and 2), α-tubulin (Abcam Cat# ab56676), and β-actin
(Abcam Cat# ab3280). Following binding of appropriate
secondary antibodies labeled with IRDye® (LI-COR),
image analysis was performed with Image Studio software
for the LI-COR Odyssey system (version 2.1.10).
Gene expression profiling was performed using a
custom designed TaqMan® low density array (TLDA).
Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen) and from xenograft tumor FFPE
tissue using RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation
(Ambion). Human and mouse, real-time qPCR TLDAs

(384-well micro fluidic card) were designed with genes
selected based on their involvement in Wnt signalling
(see supplementary Tables 2 and 3 for lists of genes on
TLDAs). cDNA was generated from total RNA using
High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life
Technologies) or SuperScript® VILO™ Master Mix (Life
Technologies). 100 ng cDNA was combined with TaqMan®
Gene Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies) for the
cell lines and TaqMan® Advanced FAST Master Mix
(Life Technologies) for the xenograft tissue for each port
(in duplicate). TLDAs were run based on recommended
cycling times for each master mix. Ct values were
calculated and imported into GeneData Analyst for further
analysis. To calculate the ΔCts, gene expression was
normalized to several housekeeping genes. Relative fold
change was calculated by comparison to the DMSO or
vehicle-treated controls for each sample. A student’s t-test
was used to calculate P-values and hierarchical clustering
used Manhattan distance and complete linkage plotting of
selected significant genes to generate heat maps.

as a single intravenous dose at 60 mg/kg on day 3 or 4.
E7449 was administered orally once daily at 100 mg/kg
with administration beginning on either day 3 or day 4.
E7449 as a single agent in MDA-MB-436
xenografts: female SCID mice were inoculated
subcutaneously with MDA-MB-436 cells (1 × 107).
E7449 treatment was initiated on day 46 post-inoculation
and continued once daily for 28 days at doses of 30 or
100 mg/kg.
E6201 and E7449 combination in Wnt1 model:
Mammary tumors were initially isolated from Wnt1
(int-1) transgenic mice [45] and the model maintained
through serial passage of tumor pieces. Tumor pieces
cut to approximately 2 mm3 in size were injected
subcutaneously in female nude mice. Treatment was
initiated approximately 9–10 days post-implantation of
mice. E7449 was administered once daily at 100 mg/kg,
alone or in combination with E6201 (MEK inhibitor),
administered intravenously every 4 days 3 times at
40 mg/kg. The porcupine inhibitor Wnt-C59 (BioVision
Cat# 2063) which inhibits Wnt signaling was included as
a positive control and dosed orally once daily at 10 mg/kg
(formulated in 0.5% methyl cellulose with 0.1% Tween 80).
Seven week old C57BL/6 female mice were
subjected to depilation using Nair™ to examine any
effect of E7449 on re-growth of hair. Drug treatment was
initiated the next day and E7449 was dosed at 30, 100 or
300 mg/kg orally once daily for 12 days. Re-growth of
hair was monitored and recorded by photography.

In vivo efficacy studies
All studies were performed according to IACUC
approved protocols. The general health of mice was
monitored daily. Tumor volume was determined by caliper
measurements (mm), using the formula (l x w2)/2 = mm3,
where l and w refer to the larger and smaller perpendicular
dimensions collected at each measurement. Tumor
dimensions were recorded twice per week starting when
tumors reached an approximate size of 100 to 150 mm3.
Body weights were recorded twice per week and relative
body weight was calculated as follows: Relative body
weight = (body weight on day of measurement/ body
weight on first day of treatment).
TMZ combination in B16-F10 isograft model:
female C57BL/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously
with B16-F10 cells (2 × 105). Following randomization
by body weight, drug treatment was initiated 1 day postinoculation. Both E7449 and TMZ were formulated in
0.5% methyl cellulose and orally administrated once
per day. TMZ was administered daily on days 1 to 5 at
50 mg/kg as a single agent or in combination. E7449 was
administered daily on days 1 to 7 at doses of 10, 30 and
100 mg/kg in combination with TMZ and at a dose of
100 mg/kg as a single agent. The control group was treated
with vehicle (0.5% methyl cellulose in water). E7449 or
vehicle was administered first and when dosing of all
animals was complete TMZ was administered to animals
receiving the combination.
Carboplatin combination in MX-1 orthotopic
xenografts: female nude mice were implanted with
MX-1 cells (0.5 × 106) in the thoracic mammary fat pad.
Treatment started on day 3 when the average tumor size
was approximately 50 mm3. Carboplatin was administered

In vivo PARP inhibition
Inhibition of PARP activity was evaluated in tumor
lysates from MDA-MB-436 xenograft mice following
administration of a single dose of E7449 at 30 or 100 mg/kg.
Control group (10 mice) were treated with vehicle (0.5%
methyl cellulose in water). Mice were euthanized and
tumors were harvested at 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36 hours post
treatment (5 mice per treatment per time point). Individual
tumors were removed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
for PAR analysis. PARP inhibition was also evaluated in
tumors from NCI-H460 human lung cancer subcutaneous
xenografts. Control group animals (24 mice) were
treated with vehicle (0.5% methyl cellulose). E7449 was
administered in a single dose at 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg.
Mice were euthanized and tumors were harvested at 0.25,
1, 6, 12, 24 and 36 hours post-treatment. PAR levels were
determined by ELISA using the procedure provided by
Trevigen and comparing to a PAR standard curve. Protein
concentration of tumor lysates was determined using the
BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Results were converted
from pg PAR/assay well to ng PAR/mg protein. Data was
pooled from multiple experiments. The percent of control
for each time point was calculated by using an average of
all control replicates from that experiment.
