BACKGROUND: Alternative response criteria have been proposed in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) who are
receiving vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy, including 10% tumor shrinkage as an indicator of response=outcome. However, to the authors’ knowledge, intraobserver and interobserver measurement variability have not been defined in this setting. The objective of the current study was to determine intraobserver and interobserver agreement of computed tomography (CT)
size and attenuation measurements to establish reproducible response indicators. METHODS: Seventy-one patients with mRCC with
179 target lesions were enrolled in phase 2 and phase 3 trials of VEGF-targeted therapies and retrospectively studied with Institutional Review Board approval. Two radiologists independently measured the long axis diameter and mean attenuation of target
lesions at baseline and on follow-up CT. Concordance correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess intraobserver and interobserver agreement. RESULTS: High concordance correlation coefficients (range, 0.8602-0.9984) were observed in
all types of measurements. The 95% limits of agreement for the percentage change of the sum longest diameter was 27.30% to
7.86% for intraobserver variability, indicating that 10% tumor shrinkage represents a true change in tumor size when measured by a
single observer. The 95% limits of interobserver variability were 216.3% to 15.4%. On multivariate analysis, the location of the lesion
was found to significantly contribute to interobserver variability (P 5.048). The 95% limits of intraobserver agreement for the percentage change in CT attenuation were 218.34% to 16.7%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mRCC who are treated with VEGF inhibitors,
10% tumor shrinkage is a reproducible radiologic response indicator when baseline and follow-up studies are measured by a single
radiologist. Lesion location contributes significantly to measurement variability and should be considered when selecting target

INTRODUCTION
Kidney cancer is the 10th leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States, with 13,680 deaths estimated to occur
among Americans in 2013 and 65,150 estimated new cases expected.1 At the time of diagnosis, approximately 20% to
30% of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) demonstrate metastatic disease and 25% to 50% of patients with locoregional disease at the time of diagnosis eventually develop metastases.2,3 Therefore, systemic therapy is indicated in a significant number of patients, yet RCC is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)-targeted treatments have become standard in the treatment of patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC),4 a setting
in which antitumor activity is evidenced by prolonged progression-free survival in treated patients, despite different rates
of tumor shrinkage.5-8
Oncologists rely on imaging to assess changes in tumor size, as detected by computed tomography (CT) scans, for
evidence of response to therapy or disease progression when determining whether to continue a therapy or consider alternative treatment. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is the widely accepted methodology with

which to determine objective response, based on the sum
of the longest unidimensional diameters (SLD) of target
lesions.9 However, < 50% of patients with RCC who are
treated with VEGF-targeted agents achieve response by
RECIST, which requires a 30% decrease in the SLD of
target lesions, even though prolonged time on therapy has
been noted in patients whose tumor shrinkage is
< 30%.5-8 For example, in the recent study of pazopanib
versus sunitinib, the response rate was 31% for pazopanib
and 25% for sunitinib.10 RECIST-based response assessment may not be optimal to accurately evaluate antitumor
activity in this setting, and alternative criteria for response
are needed.
Emerging data have supported alternative imaging criteria to define “response” to VEGF-targeted therapies in
patients with mRCC.11-17 Recently, a tumor shrinkage
threshold of 10% has been advocated as an indicator of
response.11,15 In our recent study of 70 patients with
mRCC who were treated with VEGF inhibitors, 10% tumor shrinkage at the time of first follow-up was found to be
a significant predictor of time to treatment failure and overall survival.15 Other criteria, such as those of Choi, that use
a 10% decrease in size or a 15% decrease in CT density for
response have also been applied to patients with
mRCC.11,16,17 Although data support the use of a smaller
tumor size change cutoff to define responders (a 10%
decrease vs a 30% decrease as in RECIST), to the best of
our knowledge intraobserver and interobserver measurement variability in this population have not been established
to date. It is unknown whether 10% tumor shrinkage is indicative of tumor size change or within measurement error.
To apply a new tumor shrinkage threshold indicative of
response, it is important to assess measurement reproducibility in patients with mRCC who are treated in prospective
trials of VEGF-targeted agents to ensure that the response
threshold is robust and reproducible.
The purpose of the current study was to define intraobserver and interobserver variability of tumor size and
attenuation measurements in patients with mRCC who
were treated with antiangiogenic therapy. We hypothesized that a tumor shrinkage threshold of 10% (ie, a 10%
decrease in the SLD of the target lesions) represents a true
change in tumor burden. Our goal was to advance the
application of widely available CT technology to define
the best and most reliable indicator of treatment response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment

The study sample consisted of patients with mRCC who
were enrolled in 6 recent phase 2 and phase 3 multicenter,
712

open-label studies of VEGF-targeted agents (tivozanib,
pazopanib, foretinib, sorafenib, vatalanib, and sunitinib).
Patients enrolled in these trials who had been included in
our previous study cohort were excluded from this validation cohort.15 All patients had histologically confirmed
mRCC. Patients were imaged and treated at a single institution at standard doses of study drug according to the
assigned protocol until they experienced disease progression, severe toxicity, or withdrew consent. Compliance
was checked after each cycle with a treatment diary.
Patients were part of Institutional Review Boardapproved protocols for mRCC at the institution at which
the baseline and follow-up clinical data were prospectively
collected.
Imaging and Image Analysis

Patients eligible for analysis included those with target
lesions by RECIST who underwent non–contrastenhanced or contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis before and after VEGF-targeted therapy
initiation, with pretherapy and posttherapy scans performed at the same institution. The routine oncology protocol was performed using a 64-row multidetector CT
(MDCT) scanner (Aquilion 64; Toshiba America Medical Systems, Tustin, Calif) or a 4-row MDCT scanner
(Volume Zoom; Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim,
Germany). Imaging parameters were as follows: 1) 64row MDCT scanner: 0.5-mm collimation, 120 kilovolt
peak, 100 to 500 milliamperes using dose modulation
with a noise index of 12.0 Hounsfield units (HU), a gantry rotation time of 0.5 seconds, and a table speed of 53
mm per rotation; and 2) 4-row MDCT scanner: 2.5-mm
collimation, 120 kilovolt peak, 165 milliamperes, a gantry
rotation time of 0.5 seconds, and a table speed of 11.5
mm per rotation. All patients were scanned in a cranial to
caudal direction from the clavicles to the adrenal glands in
the supine position. Patients were instructed to maintain
suspended inspiration during the CT acquisition. During
the study, 75 mL to 100 mL of iopromide (300 mg iodine=mL; based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate)
(Ultravist 300, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc,
Wayne, NJ) was injected intravenously with an automated
injector (Medrad, Pittsburgh, PA) at a rate of 2 to 3
mL=second in patients with an adequate estimated glomerular filtration rate and no known allergies. Scan delay
for the chest was 30 seconds for a 64-row MDCT and 40
seconds for a 4-row MDCT and 70 seconds for the abdomen. Axial images (5-mm thickness and 5-mm interval)
were reconstructed using standard and lung algorithms.
Coronal reformatted images (5-mm thickness and 5-mm

interval) were also reconstructed for 64-row MDCT.
Images were reviewed and measured on a picture archiving and communication system (Centricity; General Electric, Milwaukee, WI).
Up to 3 target lesions in each patient were selected on
the baseline CT by a single oncoradiologist (K.K.; radiologist 1) who was blinded to follow-up CT changes and
patient outcomes. Target lesions were selected and measured according to RECIST version 1.0,9 in keeping with
the use of long axis diameter measurements in the evaluation of the percentage tumor shrinkage in alternative
response criteria previously described.11-16 The location of
the target lesion was recorded. At baseline and at the time
of first follow-up, the longest axial axis of each target was
recorded to the nearest millimeter by 2 board-certified radiologists with expertise in cancer imaging (radiologist 1
[K.K.] and radiologist 2 [M.N.]) as described previously.15
In addition, the average CT attenuation coefficient of the
target lesions on contrast-enhanced studies was measured
on the most representative axial image and measured in
HU by drawing a freehand region of interest around the perimeter of the target, making it as large as possible to cover
the lesion without extending outside of the lesion, as previously described.12,15-18 The average HU within the region
was calculated on the picture archiving and communication
system workstation and recorded.
During each session of measurements, a radiologist
first performed baseline followed by follow-up measurements for each patient, in succession, referring to the baseline measurements. The SLD and mean attenuation of the
targets at baseline and at follow-up were also recorded.
Radiologist 1 performed 2 sessions of measurements that
were 2 months apart, in random patient order, to assess
intraobserver variation. Radiologist 2 performed each
measurement once, also in a random order, to assess interobserver variation compared with radiologist 1.
For each patient, the percentage change in SLD and
mean tumor attenuation per patient were calculated from
measurements in each session (2 sets for radiologist 1 and
1 set for radiologist 2). The percentage changes in longest
diameter and CT attenuation of each lesion were also
calculated.
Statistical Analysis

Intraobserver and interobserver variability were assessed
using: 1) concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs); 2)
mean relative difference (as a percentage) with the standard
deviation; and 3) 95% limits of agreement (the mean relative change 6 1.96 standard deviations of the difference)
for the longest diameter and average CT attenuation

assuming that the distributions of size and attenuation were
normal. CCCs are products of a measure of precision
(defined by Pearson correlation) and a measure of accuracy
(defined by a bias correction factor) in which a CCC value
of 1 indicates perfect agreement and a CCC of 21 indicates perfect reversed agreement.19 The mean relative difference (as a percentage) between the 2 measurements is
defined as 100*(M1-M2)=M1 (M1 5 measurement 1,
M2 5 measurement 2) of the difference among all tumors.
Agreement in the 2 measurements was shown visually using Bland-Altman plots with 95% limits of agreement and the average relative difference, computing the
mean relative difference (as a percentage) between the 2
measurements, plotted against the first measurement of
radiologist 1.20-22 Two measurements from radiologist 1
were used to assess intraobserver variability. The first measurement of radiologist 1 and the measurement by radiologist 2 were used to evaluate interobserver variability.
Kappa analysis was performed to assess agreement
between binary responses (> 10% decrease and  10%
decrease) to evaluate the impact of measurement variability on response assessment according to 10% tumor
shrinkage criteria. Agreement between 2 assessments was
categorized as poor (j of < 0), slight (j 5 0-0.20), fair
(j 5 0.21-0.40), moderate (j 5 0.41-0.60), substantial
(j 5 0.61-0.80), and nearly perfect (j of > 0.80).23
The influence of the location of the lesion on measurement variability of size and attenuation was assessed
using multivariate linear regression models assuming a
constant bias correction factor that comprise CCCs. Analyses were performed using MedCalc (MedCalc Software
bvba, Ostend, Belgium) and SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) statistical software.
RESULTS
Size Measurements

Baseline size was measured in 71 patients with a total of
179 target lesions. Follow-up size measurements were performed in 69 patients with 173 target lesions. Follow-up
imaging was not available for review in 2 patients (1
patient had progressive disease according to the radiology
report but archived images from 2002 were not available,
whereas another patient transferred care to another institution located out of state). In a third patient, a single
peritoneal target lesion was obscured by ascites and was
not identified on follow-up.

first follow-up CT. Figure 1 shows the Bland-Altman
plots for intraobserver and interobserver variability of the
measurements, with the mean percentage difference and
95% limits of agreement of the 2 measures.
For intraobserver variability comparing 2 measurements by radiologist 1, the CCC was high for both baseline measurements and the percentage change at followup (0.9984 and 0.9747, respectively). The 95% limits of
agreement of the 2 measures was 27.90% to 7.17% for
baseline measurements and 27.30% to 7.86% for the
percentage change on follow-up. A tumor shrinkage
threshold of 10% is beyond the 95% limits of agreement
and therefore could be considered a true change rather
than a measurement error when baseline and follow-up
measurements were performed by a single radiologist.
For interobserver variability comparing measurements by radiologist 1 versus those made by radiologist 2,
high CCCs were also observed for both baseline measurements and percentage change at first follow-up (0.9875
and 0.8969, respectively). The range of the 95% limits of
agreement of the 2 independent measures was, however,
approximately twice as wide as the intraobserver assessment and was 217.0% to 16.6% for baseline measurements and 216.3% to 15.4% for the percentage change
at follow-up. The 10% tumor shrinkage threshold is
within the range of 95% limits of agreement of interobserver variability.
The impact of measurement variability on response
assessment using the 10% tumor shrinkage threshold was
further investigated, as demonstrated in a scatterplot (Fig.
2). Using 10% tumor shrinkage as the indicator of
response, response assessment by 2 measurements from
radiologist 1 had almost perfect agreement (j 5 0.826).
714

Response assessment by measurements from radiologists
1 and 2 had substantial agreement (j 5 0.682).
In a preliminary analysis to explore the effect of intravenous (iv) contrast-enhanced CT versus non–contrastenhanced CT on measurement variability, we performed
CCC analysis for baseline SLD measurements in 54
patients with contrast-enhanced CT versus 17 patients
without contrast enhancement. For the 54 patients with
contrast, the intraobserver CCC was 0.9984 (95% confidence interval 0.9973-0.9991) and the interobserver CCC
was 0.9863 (95% confidence interval 0.9766-0.9920),
whereas in 17 patients without contrast, the intraobserver
CCC was 0.9983 (95% confidence interval 0.99550.9994) and the interobserver CCC was 0.9900 (95% confidence interval 0.9737-0.9963).
Long axis diameter measurements per lesion

Intraobserver and interobserver variability were studied in
individual lesions (179 lesions at baseline and 173 lesions
on follow-up). Table 2 summarizes intraobserver and interobserver variability of the longest diameter measurement of
individual target lesions at baseline and the percentage
change at first follow-up. The CCC was high for both intraobserver and interobserver comparisons at baseline and
follow-up (95% confidence interval 0.8602-0.9961). The
95% limits of agreement for 2 intraobserver measurements
were 210.30% to 9.24% at baseline and 210.73% to
10.96% for the percentage change at follow-up; interobserver 95% limits of agreement were 220.84% to 21.79%
at baseline and 220.79 to 18.71% at follow-up.
We further investigated the impact of the anatomic
location of the lesions on measurement variability. Table 3

with notation of the anatomic location. On multivariate linear regression models, the location of the lesion was not
found to have a statistically significant effect on measurement variability after controlling for intraobserver effect
(P 5 .35); however, it was found to have a significant
impact on measurement variability after controlling for
interobserver effect (P 5 .008). Compared with the lung as

patients who underwent contrast-enhanced CT at both
baseline and follow-up. Three patients had lung lesions
measuring < 0 HU on follow-up whose mean CT attenuation calculations were not considered to be evaluable and
these patients were thus excluded from the analysis.
Therefore, analysis of CT attenuation on follow-up was
performed in 41 patients.

CT attenuation used as a response cutoff in the Choi criteria is within these 95% agreement limits.
CT attenuation measurements per lesion

Table 5 summarizes intraobserver and interobserver
agreement in mean CT attenuation measurements (in
HU) per lesion at baseline and the percentage change at
follow-up CT. CCCs were high across the comparisons
(95% confidence interval 0.9033-0.9853); however, the
95% limits of agreements were relatively wide for the percentage change at follow-up for intraobserver comparisons (95% limits of agreement, 219.65% to 19.45%) as
well as for baseline measurements and the percentage
change at follow-up for interobserver comparisons (95%
limits of agreement, 220.03% to 18.22% and 224.06%
to 23.16%, respectively).
DISCUSSION
High intraobserver and interobserver agreements were
observed in SLD measurements and the percentage
change in SLD at the time of first follow-up in patients
with mRCC who were treated in phase 2 and phase 3 trials of VEGF-targeted agents. CCCs were > 0.9 in nearly
all assessments. A 10% tumor shrinkage threshold, which
has been shown to be a predictor of survival in patients
with mRCC,11,15 was outside the 95% limits of agreement of intraobserver variability assessment at baseline
and for the percentage change in SLD at follow-up. However, the 10% tumor shrinkage threshold was within the
95% limits of agreement in the interobserver assessment.
To the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first
comprehensive examination of intraobserver and interobserver variations in CT size and attenuation measurements

in patients with mRCC who are treated with VEGFtargeted therapies.
Prior reports have found a 10% tumor shrinkage
threshold to be indicative of a survival benefit in patients
with mRCC, using either a single radiologist observer15
or independent central review.11 The results of the current
study are concordant with these prior reports, as we have
demonstrated that changes beyond 95% limits of agreement of 27.30% to 7.86% in tumor burden are true detectable changes in overall tumor size rather than a
measurement error when baseline and follow-up measurements are performed by a single radiologist. The findings
of the current study also have implications for the assessment of progressive disease, defined as at least a 20%
increase in tumor size from nadir (or new lesions) according to RECIST. The findings of the current study indicate
that this degree of increase represents a true increase in tumor burden as measured by  1 observers. This is important because progression-free survival is a common
primary endpoint of clinical trials in this population, and
the results of the current study suggest that this endpoint
is a robust and reproducible one.
The results of the current study demonstrate that a
10% tumor shrinkage threshold is within the 95% limits
of agreement for interobserver variability, indicating that
the 10% tumor shrinkage response threshold is within the
range of measurement error using 2 radiologist observers.
It is known that interobserver variation in tumor measurements is greater than intraobserver variation, and multiple
prior reports have advocated the use of a single observer or
independent review committees to improve consistency in
serial measurements in any 1 patient.24-29 The results of
the current study support the use of a single experienced
radiologist for serial scan measurements to limit measurement variability when using a smaller change in tumor

Figure 3. Bland-Altman plots for long axis diameter measurements of individual target lesions at baseline by 2 radiologists
are shown. The figures demonstrate intraobserver or interobserver variability as a function of average measurements. The
relative difference between the baseline measurements is
plotted by the average measurement for the 2 measurements

size to define response. The results are most applicable to
radiologists who commonly interpret cancer imaging
studies and measure target lesions in their practice.
The 10% tumor shrinkage alternative response criterion represents added value to the conventional RECIST,
since RECIST-defined clinical benefit (partial response
plus stable disease) has not been found to be a surrogate
for treatment benefit in terms of survival.11,15 In this setting, 10% tumor shrinkage in response to treatment is a
threshold indicating a true change in tumor size with
prognostic value. Oncologists can use the 10% tumor
shrinkage threshold early in the treatment course to
continue an effective drug with confidence. Although
718

treatment changes may not be based on whether a patient
achieves 10% tumor shrinkage on first follow-up CT, the
prognostic value of this threshold may be of use in individual cases.
It is our impression and experience that for the majority of the target lesions, particularly lymph node, lung,
pleural, and peritoneal=retroperitoneal masses, iv contrast
did not contribute significantly to the measurement variability due to marked attenuation differences between
these masses and adjacent tissues (fat, air, etc) in the presence or absence of iv contrast. In the current study cohort,
the majority of patients received iv contrast (54 of 71
patients at baseline and 44 of 69 patients at follow-up)
and it may not possible to determine the effect of iv contrast on interobserver and intraobserver variability because
of a lack of power. However, in a preliminary analysis to
explore this point, we performed CCC analysis for baseline SLD measurements from 54 patients with contrast
enhancement versus 17 patients without contrast
enhancement on baseline scans, and both groups were
found to have similarly high CCCs.
The 95% limits of agreement for measurement variation were slightly wider for individual lesions than in the
patient-based analyses, which is not an unexpected finding. Measuring multiple target lesions to best determine
response has been advocated in prior reports.30-32 The
measurement of up to 10 targets is permitted according to
RECIST version 1.0 whereas the measurement of up to 5
targets is accepted according to RECIST version 1.1, and
nearly perfect agreement in response assessment has been
shown when using RECIST version 1.0 versus version
1.1.33,34 In many instances in routine care, as few as 3 target lesions may be used in individual patients and considered reasonable in terms of response assessment and
measurement reproducibility.
We performed a lesion-based analysis to evaluate the
influence of anatomic lesion location on measurement
variability, which to the best of our knowledge has not
been previously systematically investigated. For intraobserver comparisons, 95% limits of agreement were narrowest for discrete pleural masses followed by lesions in
the lung, and were greatest in lesions located in the liver
and retroperitoneum. For interobserver comparisons,
95% limits of agreement were narrowest for lung target
lesions followed by pleural masses, and widest in retroperitoneum and liver lesions. Because lung lesions have relatively narrow 95% limits of agreement for both
intraobserver and interobserver variation, the selection of
lung targets may be favorable if lung and other target
lesions of a similar size are available. Target lesion

selections are made taking into account several factors,
including lesion size, reproducibility, conspicuity compared with adjacent tissues, and suitability for follow-up.
On the multivariate linear regression analysis, a target lesion location within the liver contributed significantly to interobserver variability whereas others did not.
Many liver lesions have ill-defined margins on contrastenhanced CT and were difficult to precisely measure in
the current study, most likely explaining this observation.
In terms of mean CT attenuation measurements per
patient and lesion, intraobserver and interobserver variations were wider. In many cases, 95% limits of agreement
exceeded 6 15%. These findings indicate that a 15%
decrease in mean CT attenuation may be due to measurement variation rather than a true change. Because the criCancer

teria of Choi include a 15% decrease in mean CT
attenuation as a composite cutoff value, the results of the
current study may explain why multiple reports have
resulted in different conclusions regarding the usefulness
of the Choi criteria in assessing response in patients with
mRCC.12,15-17 A threshold of a > 15% decrease in CT
attenuation is needed to reliably indicate response.
The limitations of the current study include the relatively small number of patients who underwent CT scanning at a single institution. However, the number is not
substantially different from other studies of alternative
response criteria in this setting.11-17 Not all patients were
able to receive iv contrast, thereby limiting the size of the
CT attenuation assessment cohort; this is representative of
the population of patients with mRCC, including many

individuals with advanced age and=or a single kidney.
Another limitation is that we were not able to assess the
measurement variability that is inherent in conducting
CT scans in this cohort of patients with mRCC who were
treated in clinical trials and who did not undergo sameday repeat CT scans. This important issue has been
addressed by a recent study in which CT scans were
repeated within 15 minutes and target lesions were measured by 3 radiologists.21,30 We also did not assess advanced
image processing techniques such as volumetric measurements because these measurements are not routinely used
in clinical practice in determining the response assessment
of patients with mRCC and because our central objective
was to demonstrate that a 10% tumor shrinkage threshold,
a known predictor of survival, is a reliable marker in terms
of measurement reproducibility. We designed the current
study to use size and=or CT attenuation measurements
obtained with clinical CT scans, which patients typically
undergo in routine oncologic care.
In conclusion, radiologic response, as defined by a
10% decrease in the SLD of target lesions in patients with
mRCC who are treated with VEGF-targeted therapies, is
reliable and reproducible when evaluated by a single radiologist observer. The anatomic location of the lesions has a
significant impact on measurement variability, with a liver
location having the greatest effect on the measurement variability after controlling for interobserver variation. The use
of a single trained observer for both baseline and follow-up
measurements is recommended when assigning radiologic
response using the alternative 10% tumor shrinkage threshold to better predict clinical outcome.
