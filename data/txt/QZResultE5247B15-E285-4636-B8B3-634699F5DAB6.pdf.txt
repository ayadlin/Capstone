ABSTRACT
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a prototypical ligand for G protein coupled
receptors, and Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1), a transcription factor that regulates
expression of a wide array of genes involved in cancer initiation and progression, are
two important oncogenic signaling molecules in human epithelial ovarian cancers
(EOC). We conducted in vitro mechanistic studies using pharmacological inhibitors,
genetic forms of the signaling molecules, and RNAi-mediated gene knock-down to
uncover the molecular mechanisms of how these two molecules interact in EOC
cells. Additionally, in vivo mouse studies were performed to confirm the functional
involvement of FOXM1 in EOC tumor formation and progression. We show for the first
time that LPA up-regulates expression of active FOXM1 splice variants in a time- and
dose-dependent manner in the human EOC cell lines OVCA433, CAOV3, and OVCAR5.
Gi-PI3K-AKT and G12/13-Rho-YAP signaling pathways were both involved in the LPA
receptor (LPA1–3) mediated up-regulation of FOXM1 at the transcriptional level. In
addition, down-regulation of FOXM1 in CAOV3 xenografts significantly reduced tumor
and ascites formation, metastasis, and expression of FOXM1 target genes involved in
cell proliferation, migration, or invasion. Collectively, our data link the oncolipid LPA,
the oncogene YAP, and the central regulator of cell proliferation/mutagenesis FOXM1
in EOC cells. Moreover, these results provide further support for the importance of
these pathways as potential therapeutic targets in EOC.

FOXM1 expression by either thiostrepton, a selective
FOXM1 inhibitor, which may inhibit FOXM1 at the
transcriptional, post-transcriptional, as well as its promoter
binding levels [8–11], or U0126 could significantly impair
FOXM1-mediated oncogenic capacities [12]. Moreover,
overexpression of FOXM1 predicts poor prognosis and
FOXM1 promotes proliferation, migration and invasion
in the EOC cell line HO-8910 in vitro [5, 13]. However,
the concept of targeting FOXM1 in EOC needs to be
tested further since the mouse model and reagents used
may improperly address the targeting issues related to
FOXM1, due to the potential off-target effects induced by
the inhibitor, the non-HGSC nature of the cell line used
(A2780 or SKOV3), or the route of injection (s.c.) [5, 14].
In particular, FOXM1’s role in endothelial cells and other
host cells as reported [15] may complicate the anticancer
strategies targeting FOXM1 and suggests that specific
tumor cells targeting is necessary.

INTRODUCTION
Despite the pathological and genetic heterogeneity,
high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSC) share
common molecular alterations. In addition to TP53,
integrated HGSC studies identified that forkhead box M1
(FOXM1) transcription factor network is significantly
altered in 84% of HGSC cases [1, 2].
The FOXM1 protein is a proliferation-specific
transcription factor that plays a key role in controlling
expression of cell cycle genes essential for tumorigenesis
[3]. Overexpression of FOXM1 and its potential
correlations to worse prognosis and/or drug-resistance in
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have been reported by
several labs [1, 2, 4–6]. Lok et al have shown that the
overexpressed phospho-ERK and FOXM1 are correlated
well and they are significantly correlated to HGSC
with aggressive behavior [7]. In addition, inhibition of

Since FOXM1 displays a strictly proliferationspecific expression pattern, its expression is up-regulated
by proliferation signals, but down-regulated by antiproliferation signals, in particular, proto-oncoproteins
(such as AKT and Ras) and growth factors and/or their
receptors [such as epidermal growth factor receptors
(EGFRs) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR)]
[3]. Interestingly, YAP (yes-associated protein) has been
shown to be able to directly induce the transcription of
CCND1 and FOXM1 via the YAP-TEAD binding site in
the FOXM1 promoter in malignant mesothelioma (MM)
cells [16]. Surprisingly, there is no follow-up publication
in YAP-regulated FOXM1 in any other cell types, in spite
of the clear emerging attention to the roles of the HippoYAP pathway in various cancers [17–19]. In addition,
the potential regulation of FOXM1 by G protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs) and their ligands have not been
demonstrated in any cell type.
We and others show that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA),
a small bioactive phospholipid, is elevated in the blood
of EOC patients [20] and it stimulates cell proliferation,
migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis of
EOC [21–23]. LPA has been considered as an oncolipid and
an important target for EOC treatment [23–25]. LPA mediated
its functions via its G protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
LPA1–6 [26]. LPA1–3 receptors are functionally involved in
EOC cells [18, 27–30]. We have recently shown that LPA
dose- and time-dependently induced YAP dephosphorylation
(dpYAP) in human EOC cell lines OVCA433, OVCAR5,
CAOV3, and Monty-1, accompanied by increased YAP
nuclear translocation and activation [18].
To determine whether LPA itself, which is a
prototype for GPCR signaling, is able to regulate FOXM1
in cells, we conducted both in vitro and in vivo mechanistic
and functional studies in several EOC cell lines. In
addition, we tested the functional involvement of FOXM1
in vivo using a xenograft mouse model. Our work has
functionally linked the oncolipid LPA, the oncogene YAP,
and the central regulator of cell proliferation/mutagenesis
FOXM1 in EOC cells.

three repeated experiments are shown in the bar format in
Figures 1A and 1B. YAP was successfully down-regulated
by specific siRNA (Figure 1C), which blocked LPA-induced
FOXM1 up-regulation, indicating that YAP was functionally
involved in LPA-induced FOXM1 up-regulation.

LPA1–3 receptors and both of the PI3K and
Rho pathways were involved in LPA-induced
FOXM1 up-regulation
To identify the signaling pathways involved in LPAinduced FOXM1 expression, we first tested the effect of
Ki16425, a selective inhibitor for LPA receptors LPA1/
LPA3 and Y27632, a selective inhibitor of the Rho-kinase
(ROCK). As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, although these
two inhibitors increased the basal levels of FOXM1
(possibly due to an unknown non-specific effect), they
blocked the LPA-induced up-regulation of FOXM1. To
test the potential involvement of LPA receptors more
specifically, we used siRNAs to block LPA1, LPA2, and
LPA3, respectively. The efficacy and specificity of these
siRNAs have been shown in our recent publication [18].
The results shown in Figure 2B suggest that all three LPA
receptors are involved in LPA’s action on FOXM1.
LPA receptors activate Gi, Gq, and G12/13 [26]. We
found that pertussis toxin (PTX, 100 ng/mL), a selective
inhibitor of Gi protein; LY294002, a selective inhibitor of
PI3K (LY, 10 μM); U0126 (10 μM), a selective inhibitor
of the kinase of ERK1/2; and MK2203 (MK, 1 μM), a
selective inhibitor of AKT, significantly inhibited both
the basal and the LPA-induced FOXM1 expression
(Figure 2C), suggesting the Gi-PI3K-ERK-AKT pathway
is involved in LPA-induced FOXM1 up-regulation.
LPA is also a potent inducer of activation of G12/13
and we have shown that the G12/13-Rho-ROCK-protein
phosphatase 1A (PP1A) pathway is involved in LPA-induced
YAP activation in OVC433 cells [26]. Hence, we tested a
few blockers in this pathway. As expected, both okadaic
acid (OA; 100 nM), an inhibitor of PP1A, and the Rho
inhibitor C3 transferase (C3, 1 μg/mL) blocked LPA-induced
FOXM1 expression (Figure 2D). In contrast, H89 (10 μM),
an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), a downstream effector
of Gs, did not block the LPA’s inducible effect (Figure 2D).
The effects of dominant forms of Gq, G12, and
G13 were tested. G13 was involved in LPA’s induction of
FOXM1. On the other hand, G12 and Gq were much less or
not involved (Figure 2E). Among small G proteins, RhoA
and RhoB were likely to be involved (Figure 2F). These
experiments were repeated at least three times and similar
results were obtained.

RESULTS
LPA induced FOXM1 up-regulation in EOC cells
The potential regulation of FOXM1 by GPCRs
and their ligands were tested using LPA activation, since
it is a potent inducer of GPCR signaling pathways and
a well-known oncolipid of EOC. LPA dose- and timedependently up-regulated FOXM1 in OVCA433 cells,
with 10 μM of LPA and 6 hr incubation as the optimal
conditions for the induction (Figures 1A and 1B). This
effect inversely correlated to LPA’s effect on pYAP. LPAinduced de-phosphorylation of YAP (dpYAP and activation
of YAP) occurred prior to FOXM1 up-regulation (starting
at 2 hr, Figure 1A) [18]. The quantitative assay results of

FOXM1B was the major isoform that was expressed in
OVCA433 cells and was up-regulated by LPA (Figure 3B).

FOXM1 isoforms display the same DNA-binding specificity
and bind to DNA-binding sites with the consensus
sequence 5′-A-C/T-AAA-C/T-AA-3′. While FOXM1A
is a transcriptional suppressor, FOXM1B and FOXM1C
are functionally similar and both are transcriptional
activators [12]. LPA-induced FOXM1 was blocked by both
actinomycin D (ActD, 1 μg/mL) and cyclohexamine (CHX,
20 μg/mL) in OVCA433 cells (Figure 3A), suggesting that
the regulation is at the transcriptional and translational
levels. Quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR) analyses using three
pairs of PCR primers specific for FOXM1A, FOXM1B, and
FOXM1C were conducted. In OVCA433 cells, FOXM1A
was not detectable (after 45 cycles’ amplification).
FOXM1C was expressed at low levels, which were not
significantly up-regulated by LPA (P > 0.05). In contrast,

The potential functional involvement of FOXM1
in proliferation, migration, and invasion was first tested
using thiostrepton, a FOXM1 inhibitor. Thiostrepton dosedependently reduced LPA-induced FOXM1 expression in
OVCA433 cells (Figure 4A), which was accompanied
by reduced cell migration and invasion in these cells
(Figure 4B). To confirm these effects were indeed FOXM1
mediated, we established shRNA-FOXM1 knock-down

antibody only detected FOXM1B with an apparent MW ~80
KDa and the Cell Signaling antibody detected FOXM1C
with an apparent MW ~100 KDa (the increased MW may
be contributed by both the increased amino acids and posttranslational modifications) (Figure 5C). shRNA-mediated
knock-down of FOXM1 in OVCA433 (Figure  4C) and
CAOV3 (Figure 5C) support that both of these bands
are isoforms of FOXM1. To test this notion further, we
conducted RT-Q-PCR analyses in these cells. As shown in
Figure 5D, in contrast to OVCA433 cells, FOXM1C was
the dominant isoform in CAOV3. In OVCAR5 cells, both
FOXM1A and 1C forms were undetectable (after 45 cycles
of PCR amplification) and FOXM1B was the major form,
which was expressed in a relatively lower level than that
in OVCA433 cells. A summary of the relative expression
levels of the three FOXM1 isoforms in the three EOC cell
lines is shown in Figure 5E.
Treatment with siRNA against YAP or PTX completely
blocked the basal and LPA-induced FOXM1 expression
in CAOV3 cells, suggesting that the Gi and YAP signaling
pathways are both involved, similar to that in OVCA433
cells (Figure 5F). In addition, FOXM1 KD in CAOV3 also
reduced LPA-induced cell migration and invasion, and FBSinduced cell proliferation in these cells (Figures 5G and 5H).

LPA-induced FOXM1 in additional EOC cell
lines and FOXM1C was the dominant form in
CAOV3 cells
LPA’s effect in FOXM1 was not limited to
OVCA433 cells. As shown in Figure 5A, LPA (10 μM
and 6 hr) treatment also induced FOXM1 up-regulation
in CAOV3 and OVCAR5 cells. We used an anti-FOXM1
antibody from Sigma (Cat. Log # AV39518) to detect
FOXM1 (~80 KDa) in OVCA433 cells as shown in
Figures 1–4 and Figure 5A. In the course of the study,
we also used the anti-FOXM1 (D12D5, Cat. Log# 5436S)
from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Surprisingly, this
antibody did not detect FOXM1 in OVCA433 cells, but
detected a strong band in CAOV3 cells with an apparent
molecular weight of ~100 KDa (Figure 5B).
FOXM1B and FOXM1C are 748 and 763 amino
acid proteins, respectively. Our results showed that Sigma

were significantly reduced in FOXM1-KD cell injected
mice, compared to control mice (Figures 6B and 6C). In
addition, more organ sites were affected in control mice
(Table 1, n = 5 mice in each group), suggesting that the
reduced cellular activities (proliferation, migration, and
invasion) in FOXM1-KD cells detected in vitro are likely
contributing to the reduced tumoirgenesis in vivo.

several FOXM1 targets in the blood, ascites, and/or

mice. FOXM1 regulates the expression of over 220
genes [31]. We analyzed mRNA expression or protein
secretion levels of several representative genes involved
in proliferation, cell cycling, migration, or invasion,
including: amphiregulin (ARGE), polo-like kinase
1  (PLK1), aurora kinase B (AURKB), Rho-associated
coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), uPA
(plasminogen activator, urokinase; gene name PLAU),
uPAR (plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor; gene
name PLAUR), and vascular endothelial growth factor
A (VEGFA) in paired tumors from the control shRNAtransfected and FOXM1-KD cells derived tumors. As
shown in Figure 6D, PLK1, AURKB, AREG, ROCK1, uPA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and uPAR were significantly down regulated in FOXM1KD derived tumors. In addition, AREG and VEGF secreted
in ascites and serum were significantly down regulated in
KD cell injected mice (Figures 6E and 6F). Since human
primers and ELASA kits were used, these changes in gene
or protein levels are human tumor cell derived changes.

DISCUSSION
We show here, for the first time, that LPA is capable
of regulating FOXM1 expression in EOC cells, which has
not been shown in any other cell types. Interestingly, this
regulation is mediated by both the Gi-PI3K and G12/13-Rho27694

YAP pathways. In one of our previous publications, we used
pharmacological inhibitors and genetic approaches to conduct
detailed mechanistic studies of LPA and S1P-induced Akt
activation in ovarian cancer cells. We have shown that the
kinase activity and S473 phosphorylation of Akt induced by
LPA and S1P requires both mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinase (MEK) and p38 MAP kinase. MEK is likely to be
upstream of p38 in the 9 cell lines examined [32]. Other
than one report in malignant mesothelioma (MM) cells
[16], this is the first evidence that YAP is an important upstream regulator of FOXM1 in epithelial cancer cells. The
Hippo-YAP pathway has emerged as a critical oncogenic
pathway in recent years [17–19]. Our work has linked the
oncolipid LPA, the oncogenic YAP pathway, and the FOXM1
network (which has been shown to be altered in 84% cases of
HGSC) in EOC cells, providing a base for developing novel
therapeutics for EOC.
Our results suggest that each of the three LPA
receptors, LPA1–3, is essential for the action of LPA.
Ki16425, a selective antagonist of LPA1/LPA3 also
completely blocked the effect of LPA. In addition LPA2
was also involved. We have previously shown that LPA
receptors form homo- and hetero-dimers within the LPA
receptor subgroup [33]. The results in this work suggest
that these dimers may be functionally involved in LPA’s
actions. Hence, each of them is essential for LPA’s action.
FOXM1 is a key regulator of over 200 genes
involved in cancers [31]. We analyzed mRNA expression
or protein secretion levels of several representative genes
involved in proliferation and cell cycling, including
ARGE, PLK1, AURKB, as well as several others likely
to be involved in cell migration and/or invasion, such as
ROCK1, uPA, uPAR, and vascular endothelial growth
factor A (VEGFA), in paired tumors from the control
shRNA-transfected and FOXM1-KD cell derived tumors.
All of these genes/proteins have already been linked to
tumor development of EOC. Other than the well-known
functions of AREG, uPA, uPAR, and VEGF, aurora
kinases B was not detected in non-neoplastic ovaries
(n = 18), but almost all (79/80; 99%) ovarian carcinomas
exhibited aurora-B positive tumor cells [34]. PLK1 and
ROCK1 are also over-expressed in malignant ovarian
tissues and/or functionally involved in EOC [35–37].
These results support not only the specific effects on
FOXM1 in FOXM1-KD cells, but also on the molecular
basis to target the FOXM1 network in EOC.
FOXM1 is a typical proliferation-associated
transcription factor that is intimately involved in
tumorigenesis. The important roles of FOXM1 in EOC
have been implicated in previous studies [1, 2, 4–6].
Although the effect of a FOXM1 selective inhibitor,
thiostrepton, has been tested in in vivo [5], the concept
of targeting FOXM1 in EOC needs to be tested further
since the mouse model and reagents used may improperly
address the targeting issues related to FOXM1, due to the
potential off-target effect of the inhibitor, the non HGSC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

nature of the cell line used (A2780 or SKOV3); and the
route of the injection (s.c.) [5, 14]. In addition, specific
tumor cell targeting may be necessary.
Our studies using shRNA-mediated KD of FOXM1
in EOC cells have more specifically demonstrated the role
of FOXM1 in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion
in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. While pharmacological
inhibitors are most commonly used for cancer treatment,
all inhibitors have off targets. Our in vitro signaling results
suggest that although several inhibitors used blocked the
LPA-induction effects, they may increase the basal levels
of FOXM1, which is an unwanted effect. Moreover,
inhibitors also target host cells, which may result in
toxicity. In recent years, other forms of therapeutics have
been moving into clinical practice, including neutralizing
antibodies and shRNA-mediated specific gene down
regulation.
The three EOC cells lines used in this work may
represent HGSC better than other EOC cell lines used in
previous FOXM1 work. Recently, the most commonly
used EOC cell lines, including A2780 and SKOV3, have
been considered as non-HGSC cell lines [14, 38] based
on genetic and functional characterizations. CAOV3 cells
are considered “likely to be HGSC” [9]. OVCA433 and
OVCAR5 cells are not included in the two sets analyses,
but these cells have been shown to be serous cancer cell
lines with a dysfunctional p53 pathway [39, 40], one of
the most commonly shared features of HGSC cells. In
addition, we used the i.p. injection (vs. the s.c. model in
the previous studies using A2780 cells) [5] model in the
present work to better recapitulate EOC metastatic disease.
Human FOXM1 is expressed in three distinct
splice variants, which arise from the same gene through
differential splicing of the two facultative exons A1 and
A2 [31]. The resulting proteins are 801, 748, and 763 for
FOXM1A, 1B and 1C, respectively. While FOXM1A is
transcriptionally inactive in most cells, both FOXM1B and
FOXM1C are biologically active, and they play similar
biological roles. However, their expression patterns are
cell type-dependent and their regulations and biding
partners may differ [31]. FOXM1C has been found to
be the predominant form expressed in pancreatic tumors
and cancer cell lines [41]. Interestingly, we have found
that FOXM1 isoform expression pattern is cell linedependent. Both the FOXM1B and FOXM1C forms were
functionally involved in cell proliferation, migration, and
invasion. In addition, LPA was able to up-regulate both
forms in a cell line-dependent manner. Unexpected, the
Sigma and Cell Signaling FOXM1 antibodies appear
to only recognize the 1B or the 1C form, respectively
(Figure 5B), even though both antibodies should recognize
both forms theoretically. The immunogen peptide

QQESNQAEASKEVA) used for generating the Sigma
antibody is present in both 1B and 1C forms (the first 51
AA in both forms). The Cell Signaling FOXM1 antibody
27695

Oncotarget

is a monoclonal antibody against human recombinant
FOXM1 protein, which typically detects FOXM1 as a
100 kDa protein. Although this antibody is predicted
to recognize FOXM1B (Cell Signaling Data sheet),
we did not detect any bands between 50–110 KDa in
OVCA433 cells (Figure 5B), suggesting that even if it
might be recognizing FOXM1B, its sensitivity is low.
While the reasons why these antibodies showed 1B and
1C specificity are unclear, they are useful in isoform
specificity studies.
Taken together, our data support the development of
new EOC therapeutics centering at the FOXM1 network,
including identified up-stream regulators and down-stream
targets. Tumor cell specific targeting may be necessary and
tumor and or tumor-host interaction generated secreted
factors, such as AREG and/or VEGF may be used as
follow-up factors to monitor treatment and diseases
progression.

(ATCC, Manassas, VA), 0.1 mM MEM Non-Essential
Amino Acids (NEAA), 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 μg/
mL P/S. For serum starvation, cells were incubated in the
basal medium without FBS or antibiotics. LPA treatment
was always in cells starved from serum for 16 hr.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses were conducted using
standard procedures and proteins were detected using
primary antibodies and fluorescent secondary antibodies
(IRDye 800CW-conjugated or IRDye 680-conjugated
anti-species IgG, Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).
The fluorescent signals were captured on an Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln,
NE) with both 700- and 800-nm channels. Boxes were
manually placed around each band of interest, and the
software returned near-infrared fluorescent values of
raw intensity with background subtraction (Odyssey 3.0
analytical software, Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).
The protein MW marker used was the Prestained SDSPAGE Standards, broad range (BIO_RAD, Cat. Log #
161–0318).

DNA and RNA transfection

Cell lines and culture

Reverse-transcription quantitative real-time
PCR

Plates (6-well) were seeded with 5 × 104 cell/
well in 2 mL media 24 hr before transfection; cells were
80%–90% confluent and were transfected with siRNA
(100 pmol/well) or plasmid DNA (4 μg/well) using
Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY) according to manufacturer’s instruction. After
48 hr of transfection, cells were starved for migration and
invasion assays. All siRNAs were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Establish stable clones and drug selection
concentrations
FOXM1 shRNA lentiVirus vectors with GFP
(OriGene, Rockville, MD) were transfected to 293T cells
for virus packaging. OVCA433 or CAOV3 cells were
infected by virus 3 times and stable clones were selected
by puromycin (concentration 0.5 μg/mL) for 10 days.

The OVCA433 cell line was a kind gift of Dr. R.
Bast (M.D. Anderson); the CAOV3 and the OVCAR5
cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cell
lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C
with 5% CO2. OVCA433 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 with glutamine, 10% FBS (ATCC, Manassas, VA),
and 100 μg/mL penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). CAOV3
were cultured in DMEM with glutamine, 10% FBS
(ATCC, Manassas, VA), and 100 μg/mL P/S. OVCAR5
cells were cultured in DMEM with glutamine, 10% FBS

Cells were washed with cold PBS and collected
in the Qiagen RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
RNA was extracted with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) and reverse transcribed by M-MLV reverse
transcriptase. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed
on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) with a
SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).
mRNA abundance was normalized to GAPDH. Negative
controls contained no reverse transcription or the

per condition were analyzed. Relative gene expression
was calculated using the method given in Applied
Biosystems User Bulletin No.2 (P/N 4303859B), with
non-targeting siRNA-treated cells acting as the control
in each data set. Primer pairs used in this study were:

Matrigel barrier for 24 hr. After incubation, filters were fixed
and stained in Diff-Quick staining solutions. Non-invading
cells were removed using a cotton swab while invading
cells on the underside of the filter were enumerated using
an inverted microscope. All experiments were performed in
triplicate and repeated at least three times.

Proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2000 cells/
well), cultured for 48 hr, and then starved for 24 hr by
replacing the media with serum-free media (RPMI 1640
for OVCA433 cells and DMEM for CAOV3 cells),
followed by addition of 2% FBS, in the presence or
absence of thiostrepton (10 μM). The cells were further
cultured for 48 hr. Cell proliferation was evaluated by
MTT hydrolysis using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo
Molecular Technologies, Rockville, MA).

ELASA assays
Ascites and serum were collected from NOD/SCID
mice (either CAOV3 control or FOXM1-KD CAOV3
cells injected) and stored at −80°C until ELISA assays
were conducted. ELISA assays were performed using
ELASA kits from the Human ELISA Development
Systems (R&D Systems. Minneapolis, MN) in triplicate
wells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
optical density at 450 nm was measured on an automated
plate reader (PerkinElmer, Santa Clara, CA). Experiments
were repeated three times.

Migration assays
To measure cell migration, the undersurfaces of
Transwells (Costar, Corning, NY) were coated with collagen
IV (10 μg/mL, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at
4°C overnight. Coated transwells were then placed into a
24-well plate containing 0.5 mL of serum-free medium. To
determine the effect of FoxM1 in LPA induced migration,
cells were starved and pretreated with thiostrepton (10 μM)
prior to treatment with LPA (10 μM, 6 hr); detached cells (by
PBS containing 10 mM EDTA) were washed several times
with serum-free medium. Cells (106 in 100 μL) in serum-free
medium were added to the upper chamber in each transwell
and allowed to migrate for 4 hr at 37°C. LPA (10 μM) were
added to the lower chamber as the chemoattractant. Cotton
swabs were used to remove cells in the upper surface of the
transwells, and migratory cells attached on the undersurface
were stained with crystal violet solution. Transwells were
rinsed with water and air-dried. Crystal violet-stained
attached cells were solubilized in 100 μL of 10% acetic acid
and quantitated using a microplate reader at 600 nm.

Xenograft mouse model
Female NOD/SCID mice were obtained from the
In vivo Therapeutics Core, Indiana University School of
Medicine (Indianapolis, IN) at 7 to 10 weeks of age. CAOV3
cells (both FOXM1-KD and control cells, 5 × 106 in 500 μL
of PBS) were i.p. injected into mice. Tumors were monitored
in living mice every day. Mice were euthanized 30 days after
tumor cell injections, and tumor development was analyzed.
Tumors were counted at each metastatic location, and tumor
diameters were measured. Ascites were collected from
NOD/SCID mice and, after centrifugation, floating living
tumor cells (GFP-expressing cells) were counted. Animal
protocols were approved by the Indiana University School
of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee.

Invasion assays

Statistical analyses

Inner side of Transwells (8 μM pore size) were coated
with Matrigel at a concentration of 1.1 μg/mL and placed
in a modified Boyden chamber. Serum starved (24 hr) cells
were treated w/o LPA (10 μM, 6 hr), then trypsinized and
1.5 × 105 cells/well were added to the top chamber. LPA
(10 μM) served as a chemoattractant and was added to the
lower chambers. Cells were allowed to invade through the

The Student’s t-test was utilized to assess the
statistical significance of the difference between two
treatments. The asterisk rating system as well as quoting
the P value in this study was *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; and
***P < 0.001. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered
significant.
