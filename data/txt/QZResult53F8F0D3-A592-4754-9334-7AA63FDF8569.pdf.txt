ABSTRACT
Pediatric brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and are
also a leading culprit of cancer-related fatalities in children. Pediatric brain tumors
remain hard to treat. In this study, we demonstrated that medulloblastoma, pediatric
glioblastoma, and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors express significant levels of acid
ceramidase, where levels are highest in the radioresistant tumors, suggesting that acid
ceramidase may confer radioresistance. More importantly, we also showed that acid
ceramidase inhibitors are highly effective at targeting these pediatric brain tumors
with low IC50 values (4.6–50 µM). This data suggests acid ceramidase as a novel
drug target for adjuvant pediatric brain tumor therapies. Of these acid ceramidase
inhibitors, carmofur has seen clinical use in Japan since 1981 for colorectal cancers
and is a promising drug to undergo further animal studies and subsequently a clinical
trial as a treatment for pediatric patients with brain tumors.

INTRODUCTION

been the most studied with the best overall survival. The
standard treatment is chemotherapy (adjuvant lomustine,
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatin) after reduceddose radiotherapy concomitantly with vincristine [1, 5–7].
Reported 5-year event-free survival is 80% [6, 7]. However,
given the longer life expectancy, a key concern is the
development of long-term toxicity associated with current
treatment protocols [6, 8, 9].
A potential new chemotherapeutic target for
these tumors is acid ceramidase. The enzyme helps
regulate activity of ceramides in cells, affecting survival,
growth, and death of tumor cells [10]. High levels of
this enzyme have been discovered in various types of
human cancer [10]. Moreover, over-expression of the
enzyme in tumor cells confers resistance to apoptosis,
while inhibition augments response to chemotherapeutic
agents and radiation [10]. In this study, we showed

Malignant brain tumors are the most frequent solid
tumors in the pediatric population; they constitute 20% to
30% of all pediatric cancers and represent the predominant
cause of cancer-related deaths in childhood [1]. In this
study, we focus on three malignant brain tumors – atypical
rhabdoid/teratoid tumor (ATRT), glioblastoma, and
medulloblastoma. In particular, ATRT is associated with a
miserable prognosis, with medial survival at 9 to 17 months
[2]. No guidelines exist for optimal treatment and different
multimodal protocols are presently being studied to improve
outcomes [2]. For pediatric glioblastoma, most institutions
employ surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, but the role
of chemotherapy remains investigational [3, 4]. Median
overall survival ranges from 15 months up to 40 months in
various small series [4]. Of the three, medulloblastoma has

that acid ceramidase inhibitors are highly effective at
targeting medulloblastoma, pediatric glioblastoma, and
atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors. The data suggest acid
ceramidase is a novel drug target for pediatric brain
tumors. We also demonstrated that an acid ceramidase
inhibitor called carmofur, which has seen clinical use in
Japan since 1981 for colorectal cancers, is a promising
drug to undergo further animal studies and subsequently a
clinical trial for pediatric patients with brain tumors.

recurrent tumor at autopsy believed to be resisted to both
chemo- and radiotherapy [13, 14], was noted to have the
highest expression level of ASAH1, many fold higher
(Figure 1). The SJGBM2 line, which was also generated at
autopsy and had progressed despite the previous treatment
with chemotherapy, contained the lowest level of ASAH1
among cell lines being studied (Figure 1). Of the four,
only the CHLA200 line had prior radiation [14, 15].
CHLA259 and CHLA266 lines were generated at the time
of diagnosis, prior to any therapies [14].

RESULTS

Pediatric brain tumor cells are highly sensitive to
ASAH1 inhibitors: OE and carmofur

Patient derived pediatric brain tumor cells
express significant levels of ASAH1

To examine the role of ASAH1 in survival of
pediatric brain tumor cells, we used previously identified
ASAH1 inhibitors N-oleoylethanolamine (OE) and
carmofur [10, 16, 17]. To study their efficacy, MTT assays
were performed with OE and carmofur against CHLA259,
CHLA266, SJGBM2, and CHLA200 cells [10, 16]. Despite
their known multidrug resistance phenotype, all four cell
lines were highly sensitive to OE and carmofur with IC50
values ranging from 4.6, 50 µM (Figure 2 and Table 1).

ASAH1 has been shown to correlate with prostate
tumor progression, and poor outcomes [11, 12]. To better
understand the role of ASAH1 in pediatric brain tumors,
the expression level of ASAH1 in these pediatric tumor cell
lines were analyzed. Western blot analysis of CHLA259,
CHLA266, SJGBM2, and CHLA200 cells demonstrated
significant expression levels of ASAH1 (Figure 1). Of
the four, the CHLA200 line, which was generated from a

pediatric brain tumors and 1 adult glioblastoma cell line (U87) are shown. The blot was overexposed to show the faint ASAH1 band from
SJGBM2 cells. (B) Quantitation of the relative ASAH1 expression level was performed with ImageJ. CHLA200 cells express many folds

with carmofur underwent significant stainings with
the Annexin-V-Alexa-488 conjugate as demonstrated
by fluorescent signals, which strongly suggested these
cells underwent apoptosis (Figure 3). Cells that were
not exposed to carmofur demonstrated no significant
fluorescent signals. Compared to control, cells treated with
carmofur became more rounded, changing their shapes,
and appeared to be in various stages in disintegration.

carmofur underwent apoptosis as demonstrated

Pediatric brain tumors were more sensitive to
carmofur than temozolomide

It has been well demonstrated that inhibition of
acid ceramidase will elevate the ceramide level, which
in turn induces cell apoptosis [16, 18–20]. To test this
theory, tumor cells treated with carmofur were exposed
to the Annexin-V-Alexa-488 conjugate to evaluate for
the evidence of apoptosis. As expected, CHLA259,
CHLA266, SJGBM2, and CHLA200 cells treated

approved for adult glioblastoma [21]. To compare the
effectiveness of carmofur and TMZ at killing tumor
cells, we performed MTT cell survival studies with

these drugs. MTT assays demonstrated that minimal cell
death occurred in CHLA259, CHLA266, SJGBM2, and
CHLA200 cells treated with TMZ, while at just half the
concentration of TMZ, carmofur treatment resulted in
> 50% cell death (Figure 4). Moreover, TMZ actually
enhanced the cell growth of CHLA266 and CHLA200 by
almost 2-folds compared to the control (Figure 4).

phosphate (Sph-1P) level remained unchanged between
CHLA266 and SJGBM2 cells (Figure 5).

Treatment of SJGBM2 cells with carmofur
resulted in intracellular accumulation of
ceramides
In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of action,
we decided to evaluate the change in intracellular level
of ceramides following carmofur treatment. Treating
cultures of SJGMB2 cells with 50 µM carmofur resulted
in intracellular accumulation of various ceramide
species, which were identified and quantified by liquid
chromatography and mass spectrometry (Figure 6). This
finding, which is in consistent with other study [10],
suggests that carmofur inhibits ASAH1 activity and
elevates tissue ceramide levels.

A high level of ASAH1 is associated with a
lower level of its substrates and a higher level
of its endproducts, ceramides and sphingosines,
respectively
To determine whether a higher level of ASAH1 can
modulate the sphingolipid pathway, sphingolipid levels
were determined in cells with high (CHLA266) and low
(SJGBM2) levels of ASAH1 (Figure 1). As expected,
ceramide, the substrate of ASAH1, levels were found to
be decreased in CHLA266 cells compared to SJGBM2
cells (Figure 5). In consistent with this pathway, the
endproduct of ASAH1, which is sphingosine (Sph), is
higher in CHLA266 cells than from SJGBM2 cells. While
dihydrosphingosine (dhSph), and sphingosine (Sph) levels
were increased in CHLA266 cells, the sphingosine-1-

DISCUSSION
ASAH1, a lysosome cysteine amidase, plays an
important role in the metabolism of sphingolipids by
converting ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acid
[18, 22, 23] (Figure 7). Sphingosine is phosphorylated into

a tumor promoter sphingosine-1-phosphate (Sph-1P), by
sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) or 2 (SPHK2) (Figure 7)
[22]. Sph-1P stimulates glioblastoma cell invasiveness
in vitro via the up-regulation of the urokinase plasminogen
activator, its receptor, and proinvasive molecule CCN1
[24, 25]. Ceramide has been shown to induce apoptosis
in cells that have undergone radio- and chemotherpay
[18, 22, 23, 26]. The mechanism of action of ceramide
appears to relate to the release of cytochrome c leading
to the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 [17]. ASAH1
is associated with tumor progression and invasiveness
especially in melanoma, colon, and prostate cancers
[11, 12, 27]. In particular, the treatment of the adult
glioblastoma U87MG cell line with OE sensitizes these

cells to radiation [16]. Among cell lines being studied, our
Western blot data revealed the highest expression level
of ASAH1 in CHLA200 cells (Figure 1). CHLA200 was
generated at autopsy from a recurrent tumor invading the
hemisphere, brainstem, and cerebellum, which had been
previously treated with vincristine and radiotherapy [14].
Despite the prior radiation and chemotherapy, CHLA200
tumors still recurred in the patient that the cell line was
derived from, which suggests this tumor is both radio- and
chemoresistant [13, 14]. Consistent with this finding, other
investigators reported: 1) that over-expressed ASAH1 in
prostate cells led to larger tumor volumes that are more
resistant to chemotherapy; 2) when ASAH1 is suppressed,
cells become more sensitive to chemotherapy; and 3)

the treatment with B13, an ASAH1 inhibitor, sensitizes
these cells to radiation [11, 28]. We speculate that the
high expression level of ASAH1, that was either induced
by radiation or naturally occurring in the subpopulation
of cells, enables CHLA200 cells to survive the prior
radio- and chemotherapy. Due to the ability of ASAH1 to
metabolize ceramides into Sph, we also found that cells
containing a higher level of ASAH1 are also associated
with a lower level of ceramides and a higher level of Sph.
Not too unexpectedly is that the intracellular level of
Sph-1P is not influenced by the level of ASAH1 as other
researchers have been shown that Sph-1P can be secreted
into the extracellular space allowing cells to maintain a
steady level of intracellular Sph-1P [23–25, 29] (Figure 5).
Given its important role in cancer formation, prior studies
have suggested ASAH1 as a novel anti-cancer target in
other non-central-nervous-system cancers [20]. To test the
effectiveness of ASAH1 inhibitors at targeting pediatric
brain tumors, we treated these pediatric brain tumor cell

lines with known ASAH1 inhibitors, carmofur and OE
[10, 16, 30]. Despite their multidrug resistance phenotype,
CHLA200, SJGBM2, CHLA266, and CHLA200 cells
remain highly sensitive to carmofur and OE [13, 14]
(Figure 2 and Table 1). No clear correlation between IC50
values and the level of ASAH1 expression was observed.
This could be a result of having 4 different unrelated cells
lines. In addition to the difference in ASAH1 expression
level, the difference in the condition that the drug will
be presented with in each of these cell lines could also
influence IC50 values. Cells treated with ASAH1 inhibitors
are induced to undergo apoptosis due to the elevated
level of ceramide (Figure 6) [18, 22]. As expected,
we demonstrated that all of these cell lines underwent
apoptosis when treated with carmofur as evidenced by the
binding of the Annexin-V-Alexa-488 conjugate, which
produced the fluorescent signal observed under fluorescent
microscopy (Figure 3). For comparison, we evaluated the
effectiveness of TMZ against these pediatric brain tumor

prepared and lipids were extracted for mass spectrometry as described in Materials and Methods. Intracellular ceramide and sphingolipid
levels are from SJGBM2 cells (black bars) and SJGBM2 cells treated with 50 µM carmofur (gray bars). These levels were adjusted for
equal loading based on the phosphate level. Results shown are mean ± SD of three replicates. *P < 0.05.

Figure 7: The schematic diagram of the metabolic ceramide pathway is shown. ASAH1 converts ceramide into sphingosine,
which is subsequently metabolized to sphingosine-1-phosphate by SPHK1 or 2. Ceramide is a tumor suppressor, promoting apoptosis and
chemo/radio-sensitization. Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a tumor promoter, enhancing survival, angiogenesis, and proliferation.

cell lines. Not surprisingly, given their known multidrug
resistance phenotype, TMZ was not effective at targeting
any of the pediatric brain tumors tested (Figure 4). For
unclear reason(s), TMZ actually enhanced the cell growth
of CHLA200 and CHLA266 cell lines when treated over
a period of 12 hours. A recent report by Stepanenko et
al demonstrated that TMZ treatment of glioblastoma
cells results in diverse responses that include enhanced
proliferation and migration due to chromosomal instability
induced by TMZ [31]. Further investigation is needed to
determine if a similar mechanism of effect is playing a role
here as well. These results suggest that carmofur is apt to
be much more effective than TMZ and is a promising drug
that should be further evaluated to treat multiple pediatric
brain tumors. Carmofur has been used as a treatment for
colorectal cancers since 1981 and has been shown to be
able to cross the blood-brain barrier [10, 30].

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed using
standard methods. Gel is blocked with 5% bovine serum
albumin. A 1:500 dilution was used for primary antibody
and 1:10,000 for secondary antibody. ImageJ software was
used to quantify Western blot images.

3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells were plated onto a 96-well plate at the density
of 1 × 105 cells/ml. Media was exchanged to serum-free
media after overnight incubation. Cells were treated with
various drugs (OE, carmofur) dissolved in DMSO for
24 hours. MTT reagents were added after 24 hours of
incubation, followed by acidic-isopropanol 4 hours later
to dissolve formazan. All wells contained less than 0.2%
of final concentration of DMSO. The absorbance values
were recorded at wavelengths 570 and 630 nm. IC50’s were
calculated with the GraphPad Prism software.

Reagents and cells

Sphingolipid quantification

Mouse antibody against ASAH1 (612302) was
purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA).
Anti-actin, carmofur, temozolomide (TMZ), and
N-oleoylethanolamine (OE), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). DMSO, used to
dissolve carmofur, temozolomide, and OE, was purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). HRP-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG was supplied by R&D Systems, Inc.
(Minneapolis, MN). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
materials and the Annexin V kit were obtained from Life
Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY).

Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry
(ESI/MS/MS) analysis of endogenous (phyto)sphingosine
bases, sphingoid base-1-phosphates and (phyto)ceramide
species were performed on a Thermo Fisher Quantum
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a
Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) positive ionization
mode, using the modified version [33]. Briefly, biological
materials were fortified with the internal standards (ISs: C17
base D-erythro-sphingosine (17CSph), C17 sphingosine1-phosphate (17CSph-1P), N-palmitoyl-D-erythro-C13
sphingosine (13C16-Cer) and heptadecanoyl-D-erythrosphingosine (C17-Cer) and C6-Phyto-ceramide), then
extracted with ethyl acetate/iso-propanol/water (60/30/10
%v/v) solvent system. After evaporation and reconstitution
in 150 µl of methanol, samples were injected on the
HP1100/TSQ Quantum LC/MS system and gradient
eluted from the BDS Hypersil C8, 150 × 3.2 mm, 3 µm
particle size column, with 1.0 mM methanolic ammonium
formate/2 mM aqueous ammonium formate mobile phase
system. Peaks corresponding to the target analytes and
internal standards were collected and processed using
the Xcalibur software system. Quantitative analysis was
based on the calibration curves generated by spiking an
artificial matrix with the known amounts of the target
analyte synthetic standards and an equal amount of the
internal standards (ISs). The target analyte/IS peak areas
ratios were plotted against analyte concentration. The
target analyte/IS peak area ratios from the samples were
similarly normalized to their respective ISs and compared
to the calibration curves, using a linear regression model.
Introduction of the internal standards to the samples prior
to extraction, yields results already “recovery corrected,”
therefore, no further data manipulation are necessary.

Cells
Pediatric Anaplastic medulloblastoma (CHLA259),
pediatric glioblastoma (SJGBM2 and CHLA200), and
pediatric atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (CHLA266)

Cell Culture and Xenograft Repository [13–15]. SJGBM2
and CHLA200 are classified as glioblastoma, not otherwise
specified (NOS), CHLA259 as medulloblastoma, NOS,
according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016
classification of tumors of the central nervous system [32].
These cells were grown in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s
medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum,
4mM L-glutamine, and 1X ITS (5 μg/mL insulin, 5 μg/mL
transferrin, 5 ng/mL selenous acid).

Western blot analysis and quantification
Equal amounts (15µg) of protein from each of
the tumor samples were loaded onto the 4, 12% gel.

CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrated that medulloblastoma, pediatric
glioblastoma, and atypical teratoid rhabdoid cell lines
express significant levels of acid ceramidase, where
levels are highest in the radioresistant tumors, suggesting
that acid ceramidase may confer radioresistance. More
importantly, we also showed that acid ceramidase
inhibitors are highly effective at targeting these pediatric
brain tumors with low IC50 values (4.6, 50 µM). This
data suggests acid ceramidase could be used as a novel
drug target for adjuvant pediatric brain tumor therapies.
Of these acid ceramidase inhibitors, carmofur has seen
clinical use in Japan since 1981 for colorectal cancers
and is a promising drug to undergo further animal studies
and subsequently a clinical trial for pediatric patients with
brain tumors.
