BACKGROUND: End-of-life care (EOLC) discussions and treatment-related decisions, including phase 1 trial enrollment, in patients
with incurable disease are complex and can influence the quality of EOLC received. The current study was conducted in pediatric oncology patients to determine whether end-of-life characteristics differed between those who were and were not enrolled in a phase 1
trial. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 380 pediatric oncology patients (aged <22 years at the time of death)
who died during a 3.5-year period. Of these, 103 patients with hematologic malignancies were excluded. A total of 277 patients with
a diagnosis of a brain tumor or other solid tumor malignancy were divided into 2 groups based on phase 1 trial enrollment: a phase 1
cohort (PIC; 120 patients) and a non-phase 1 cohort (NPIC; 157 patients). The EOLC characteristics of these 2 cohorts were compared
using regression analysis and chi-square testing. RESULTS: A comparison of patients in the PIC and NPIC revealed no significant differences in either demographic characteristics (including sex, race, religious affiliation, referral origin, diagnosis, or age at diagnosis,
with the exception of age at the time of death [P 5.03]) or in EOLC indices (such as use or timing of do not attempt resuscitation
orders, hospice use or length of stay, forgoing life-sustaining therapies, location of death, time from first EOLC discussion to death,
and total number of EOLC discussions). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study of a large cohort of deceased pediatric cancer patients indicate that enrollment on a phase 1 trial does not affect EOLC characteristics, suggesting that quality EOLC can be

INTRODUCTION
Patients with serious life-threatening illness and terminal disease deserve high-quality advance care planning and end-oflife care (EOLC). These patients, for whom standard medical therapy offers no realistic chance of cure, often participate
in clinical research such as phase 1 drug trials. The primary objective of a phase 1 trial is to identify the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) of a new agent, or new combination of agents, and describe the toxicity profile and pharmacokinetics of the
drug. Phase 1 trials may expose patients nearing the EOL to a risk of adverse effects beyond drug-related toxicity, which
may include delays in advance care planning and suboptimal quality of EOLC.
In the field of pediatric oncology, the majority of patients and families are familiar with clinical trial participation.
In the developed world, up to 70% of children diagnosed with cancer are enrolled and treated on a clinical trial.1-3
Parents of children who experience treatment failure often seek the advice of the child’s physician regarding open trials
and many patients are ultimately enrolled on a phase 1 trial. Phase 1 trials expose children to risk with a very low chance
of direct benefit, and the majority of children eventually die of their disease.4 In pediatric oncology, phase 1 trials have
been questioned ethically because they expose children with terminal disease to risk without a significant chance of therapeutic benefit.5-7
Although the chance of disease eradication is extremely low, patients and their families may derive other benefits
from participation such as disease stabilization, symptom relief, and maintenance of hope.6,8-10 Parents of children with
incurable cancer may believe that phase 1 trial participation allows them to be a “good parent” by advocating for

continued cancer-directed therapy, believing this is what
is right and in their child’s best interests.11 Children and
adolescents with cancer, as well as their parents, acknowledge their role in contributing to research that might benefit and decrease the suffering of future patients.12 In
describing EOL decision-making, including phase 1 trial
participation, pediatric cancer patients relate that the
most influential factor in their decision-making was caring for others.13 Although altruistic, it is crucial that these
patients are not exposed to undue risk during clinical trial
participation that would compromise their own care,
especially at the EOL.
Studies have explored the perception, preferences,
and characteristics of participants in phase 1 oncology trials; however, to the best of our knowledge, research is limited in describing the EOL characteristics of children
enrolled on phase 1 trials and the effect of participation in
phase 1 trials on EOLC. In the current study, we describe
the characteristics of children with cancer at EOL to determine whether enrollment, compared with nonenrollment,
in a phase 1 trial affects EOLC for the patient and family.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Inclusion Criteria

In this retrospective study, the medical records of all 505
patients treated at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
who died between July 1, 2001 and February 28, 2005
were reviewed. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of cancer and age <22 years at the time of death. Of
the 505 patients, 74 were excluded on the basis of age and
51 were excluded because of a noncancer diagnosis, leaving 380 patients. The primary analysis of this cohort
aimed to determine whether race affects EOLC characteristics.14 For the current secondary analysis, in which
patients enrolled or not enrolled on a phase 1 trial were
compared, 103 patients with hematologic malignancies
were excluded because of their low rate of participation in
phase 1 trials, with only 7 of these patients having participated in a phase I trial. Thus, 277 patients who were diagnosed with either a brain tumor (neurooncology) or other
solid tumor malignancy were included in the current
analysis.
Characteristics for Comparison

The 277 patients were divided into 2 cohorts: those who
were enrolled in a phase 1 trial (phase 1 cohort [PIC]; 120
patients) and those not enrolled in a phase 1 trial (nonphase 1 cohort [NPIC]; 157 patients). Patient demographics and the EOLC characteristics of both groups

were compared. Demographic comparison included sex,
race, diagnosis, religious affiliation, referral origin, and
age at diagnosis and death. The following markers of EOL
decision-making, commonly used as surrogate variables
for quality of EOLC, were used for EOLC comparison:
do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR), decision for no
further escalation of life-sustaining therapies, and discontinuation of life-sustaining therapies. DNAR was evaluated by the presence or absence of a DNAR order, the
percentage of patients with changes in their DNAR status,
time from the DNAR order to death, time from the first
EOLC discussion to the DNAR order, and the number of
EOLC discussions for those patients with a DNAR order.
The reasons documented for the DNAR order, types of
DNAR orders, and duration of and rationale for changes
in patients’ DNAR status were also studied. A decision for
no further escalation of life-sustaining therapies was evaluated by the presence of an order to this effect in the medical record. Discontinuation of life-sustaining therapies
was evaluated by the presence or absence of discontinuation of artificial life-sustaining therapies. The general
characteristics of EOLC in the 2 cohorts were also
reported in terms of location of death, time from first
EOLC discussion to death, the percentage of patients enrolled in hospice, and time from hospice enrollment to
death.
Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square tests
with exact P values, the Fisher exact test, and Wilcoxon
rank sum tests to compare the differences between the
PIC and NPIC. The Cochran–Mantel-Haenszel statistics
were computed, and the general association statistic was
reported to compare the differences in place of death
between the 2 cohorts while controlling for diagnosis.
The main outcomes (dependent variables) were characteristics of EOL decision-making and EOLC such as
DNAR, discontinuation of life-sustaining therapies,
orders for no escalation of life-sustaining therapies, and
hospice. The predictors (independent variables) included
diagnosis, phase group (PIC or NPIC), and patient age at
the time of death. The numerical-dependent variables
that were not normally distributed were logarithmically
transformed to minimize the effect of outliers, and the
normality residual assumption for linear regression model
was checked. The nominal significance level was set at
.05. SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC) and StatXact statistical software for Windows (version 8; Cytel Corporation, Cambridge, Mass)
were used for statistical analyses.

Patient Characteristics

summary of EOLC characteristics among the PIC versus NPIC.

Of the 380 pediatric oncology patients included in the
primary analysis, 277 with a diagnosis of a brain tumor
(143 patients) or other solid tumor malignancy (134
patients) who died between July 1, 2001 and February 28,
2005 were included in the current study. Table 1 summarizes the patient characteristics. There were no significant
differences noted with regard to sex, race, diagnosis, referral origin, religious affiliation, or age at diagnosis between
the PIC and NPIC. There was a significant difference in
the age at death observed between the 2 cohorts (P 5.03),
with patients in the PIC (aged 9.23 years 6 5.39 years)
dying at a slightly younger age than patients in the NPIC
(aged 10.86 years 6 6.08 years).
There were no statistically significant differences
with regard to EOLC characteristics between patients
in the PIC compared with those in the NPIC, including
use or timing of DNAR orders, hospice use or length of
stay, forgoing life-sustaining therapies, location of
death, time from first EOLC discussion to death, and
total number of EOLC discussions. Regression models
to control for diagnosis and patient age at death further
supported these conclusions. Tables 2 and 3 show a

DISCUSSION
Phase 1 pediatric oncology trials use dose escalation to identify the side effects and establish a safe dose, or MTD, for
novel anticancer agents, the majority of which have been previously studied in phase 1 trials performed among adults.15
Phase 2 trials use MTD data to study the efficacy and safety
of these agents in a larger group of participants. By design,
phase 1 trials are not intended to assess the efficacy of the
anticancer agent and offer a small (5%-10%) chance of
measurable benefit.16,17 Critics of phase 1 studies cite the
low risk of direct benefit, potential risk of physical or psychosocial harms (eg, adverse events, financial and emotional
burdens of continued therapy), and the risk of unrealistic optimism by families and oncologists as potential concerns
when enrolling children with incurable cancer in such trials.
We believe the current study provides valuable insight into
the similarities and differences between EOL characteristics
for pediatric patients with incurable brain or solid tumors
who did or did not participate in a phase 1 trial.
The current study did not aim to assess the safety or
efficacy of pediatric phase 1 trials. A previous study

indicated that phase 1 trials in children are safe (with a
treatment-related mortality rate of approximately 0.5%)
and well tolerated (25% of patients experienced toxicity
of grade 3).17 The objective response rates (6.8% for
single-agent phase 1 studies and 20.1% for multiagent
phase 1 studies) in pediatric patients are higher than those
reported in adult patients.17 Furthermore, participation
may include other direct benefits such as temporary disease stabilization, symptom relief, and the psychological
benefit of maintaining hope by “not giving up” on
disease-directed therapy.6,8-10
The current study begins to address criticisms that
continued aggressive cancer-directed therapy, through a
phase 1 trial, can affect a patient’s opportunities for
advance care planning and quality EOLC. The lack of significant differences between patients in the PIC and
NPIC with regard to use and timing of DNAR orders,
hospice use, length of hospice stay, location of death, timing and number of EOLC discussions before death, and
forgoing of life-sustaining therapies suggests that enrollment on a phase 1 trial does not affect critical aspects of
EOLC. The results of the current study suggest that quality EOLC can be delivered to pediatric oncology patients
irrespective of a decision to enroll in a phase 1 trial.
This finding is crucial for clinicians to provide the
most accurate information when helping families understand their options and make pivotal medical decisions.

Despite comprehensive consent conferences in pediatric
oncology, families often do not comprehend the basics of
phase 1 research and tend to overestimate their child’s
chance for benefit.18 Furthermore, the majority of families who are offered a phase 1 clinical trial will ultimately
enroll to participate in the trial.18 Despite these considerations, it is reassuring that children with cancer can receive
quality EOLC regardless of whether they participate in a
phase 1 trial.
Although the finding of a younger age at the time of
death among patients in the PIC compared with those in
the NPIC was significant, this difference was small, the
overall sample size was small, and the standard deviation
range for both groups was quite wide. In light of these factors and phase 1 safety data, we do not believe that this age
difference is causally related to participation in a phase 1
trial or is clinically significant. Although we did not measure aggressiveness of disease, we posit that if patients in the
PIC had a shorter disease duration because of the highly
aggressive nature of their disease, they may have been more
motivated to enroll in a phase 1 trial. Furthermore, phase 1
trials are typically developed and offered to combat highly
aggressive disease types, which inherently lead to earlier
death and thereby also account for this finding. Future
research could help to elucidate the effect of disease aggressiveness on phase 1 trial participation and EOLC indices.
The results of the current study should be interpreted in light of study limitations. Patients with

hematologic malignancies were excluded from the current
study, but this was a minor limitation because this group
has been traditionally underrepresented in phase 1 trials,
most likely because of the availability of salvage regimens,
stem cell transplantation, and rapid disease progression.17
The current study was a single-center retrospective review,
which may not be representative of the experience at other
centers conducting phase 1 trials. Families treated at cancer centers not conducting phase 1 trials who choose not
to explore therapy at a phase 1 center may have important
differences from our patients in the NPIC. Because the
study was a retrospective chart review, the data were limited in availability and resulted in a considerable amount
of missing data for specific variables in which documentation was insufficient, a limitation that could lead to a significant difference between what was observed and actual
events. The use of surrogate variables as quality indicators
rather than direct variables as outcome measures, such as
physical and emotional symptom distress, treatment burden, adverse events, and measures of quality of life and of
hope, is also a limitation by virtue of data availability in a
retrospective study of this nature. These important limitations restrict the ability to prove causality in the way that a
prospective study using direct variables might. Furthermore, the increasing development and testing of biologically targeted therapeutic agents in recent years may
account for important differences in the risk-benefit profile of current phase 1 trials compared with those of the
past decade. These limitations call for future research with
well-designed prospective studies using direct variables
and outcome measures, which could greatly enhance
knowledge and practice in the field.
Conclusions

The results of the current study indicate that participation
in a phase 1 trial does not alter the important characteristics of advance care planning discussions and EOLC in
pediatric oncology patients. This suggests that patients
with terminal illness are equally able to experience quality
EOLC regardless of whether they choose to enroll on a
phase 1 trial. Prospective studies comparing patients in
phase 1 and non-phase I cohorts are required to confirm
the results of the current study and for broader patient
population applicability. We recommend using an individualized and integrated approach19 when discussing
participation in phase 1 trials and EOLC decision-making
for children with incurable cancer and other patients with
life-limiting illness.
