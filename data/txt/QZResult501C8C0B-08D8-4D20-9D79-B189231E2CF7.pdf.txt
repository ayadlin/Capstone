BACKGROUND: In vitro studies in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines and patient-derived cells have demonstrated
synergistic apoptosis with combined rituximab and bortezomib (R-bortezomib) compared with single-agent bortezomib. Therefore, the authors of this report evaluated R-bortezomib in a preclinical model and in a phase 2 clinical trial.
METHODS: A Hu-MCL-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) model engrafted with the Jeko cell line was treated
with R-bortezomib, bortezomib, or rituximab. Twenty-five patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (n ¼ 11) and
MCL (n ¼ 14) received 375 mg/m2 rituximab on Days 1 and 8 and 1.3 to 1.5 mg/m2 bortezomib on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11
every 21 days for a median of 3 cycles (range, 1-5 cycles). RESULTS: R-bortezomib resulted in a statistically significant
improvement in overall survival in Hu-MCL-SCID mice. In the clinical trial, the overall response rate was 40% in all 25
patients, 55% in patients with follicular lymphoma, and 29% in patients with MCL. The estimated 2-year progressionfree survival (PFS) rate was 24% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-53%) in all patients and 60% (95% CI, 20%-85%)
in responding patients. Thirteen patients (52%) developed grade 3 neurotoxicity, which consisted of constipation/
ileus, sensory or motor neuropathy, or orthostatic hypotension. Patients who were heterozygous for the CD32a (Fcc
receptor IIa) 131 histidine (H) to arginine (R) polymorphism had a significantly decreased PFS (P ¼ .009) after R-bortezomib compared with HH and RR homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: R-bortezomib had significant activity in patients
with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and MCL, although an unexpectedly high incidence of grade 3 neuroC 2010 American Cancer

In single-agent trials, the reversible 26S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has significant activity in patients with relapsed
or refractory, indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).1-5 In phase 1 studies, doses of 1.04 mg/m2 twice weekly for 4
weeks or 1.56 to 1.65 mg/m2 twice weekly for 2 weeks were the maximum tolerated doses of bortezomib in hematologic
malignancies and solid tumors, respectively.2,6,7 Subsequent phase 2 studies used 1.5 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every
21 days in patients with NHL.1,3 In those trials, the overall response rates (ORR) were 15% to 77% in patients with follicular lymphoma and 29% to 50% in patients with MCL.1,3,4 This significant single-agent efficacy supports the clinical
evaluation of combination regimens that incorporate bortezomib. One such approach includes combining rituximab and
bortezomib (R-bortezomib) because of the potential for nonoverlapping toxicity, with little expected impact of rituximab
on bortezomib-related myelosuppression or neuropathy. In Mino and Jeko MCL cell lines and in patient-derived MCL
cells, Alinari et al demonstrated synergistic apoptosis and enhanced nuclear factor jB (NF-jB) and phospho-AKT depletion with R-bortezomib.8 Wang et al demonstrated synergistic apoptosis with bortezomib, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide, with earlier apoptosis through cleavage of caspases 8, 9, and 3 than that observed with single-agent bortezomib.9
Increased expression of CD20 in rituximab-resistant lymphoma cell lines also is observed after bortezomib, which may
reverse acquired therapeutic resistance to rituximab.10 Therefore, based on the in vitro synergy observed with R-

bortezomib, we examined the in vivo activity of this combination in a preclinical model of human MCL followed
by a phase 2 trial of R-bortezomib in patients with
relapsed or refractory mantle cell and follicular NHL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preclinical Model of Human Mantle Cell
Lymphoma Model
Four to 6-week-old female severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (Taconic Farms; Hudson, NY) were
depleted of murine natural killer (NK) cells with intraperitoneal injections of 0.2 mg of rat antimouse interleukin-2
receptor b monoclonal antibodies (TMb1) 1 day before
engraftment with human MCL cell lines and then every
week thereafter. Prior cell-dose titration trials with 3
MCL cell lines (SP53, Jeko, and Mino cells) determined
the optimal dose of cells that led to consistent engraftment
and fatal tumor burdens in 100% of mice.11 Without
intervention, mice engrafted with 40  106 Jeko cells had
a mean survival of 28 days. Because Jeko cells demonstrated a more resistant phenotype with regard to induction of apoptosis, this cell line was selected for a
preclinical model. For each in vivo treatment, bortezomib
and rituximab stock solutions were diluted to the appropriate volume with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at
room temperature on the day of treatment. Engrafted
mice (8 per group) received intraperitoneal bortezomib (1
mg/kg) and/or rituximab (100 lg), every 3 days starting
at Day 15 after engraftment. Vehicle control was either
PBS or herceptin for bortezomib or rituximab, respectively. Mice were sacrificed upon evidence of tumor burden, and complete necropsy was performed with
histopathologic evaluation. All animal research was
reviewed and approved by University Laboratory Animal
Resources at the Ohio State University.
Patient Selection
From December 2005 until June 2009, 25 patients aged
18 years with histologically confirmed, grade 1 or 2
mantle cell or follicular NHL according to the World
Health Organization classification12 who relapsed or were
refractory after at least 1 previous therapy were enrolled
into a clinical trial of combined R-bortezomib (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00201877). Inclusion criteria
included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 3, an absolute neutrophil count
1000/mm3, platelets 50,000/mm3, creatinine clearance 30 mL/minute, bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, alkaline

phosphatase <2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN),
and aspartate aminotransferase 3 times the ULN.
Patients with pre-existing grade 1 or greater sensory neuropathy were excluded. The institutional review board of
the Ohio State University approved the protocol, and all
patients provided written informed consent according to
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Study Design
Induction therapy consisted of 375 mg/m2 rituximab on
Days 1 and 8 followed by 1.5 mg/m2 bortezomib on Days
1, 4, 8, and 11 every 21 days. To measure the percentage
of proteasome inhibition with bortezomib alone and after
the addition of rituximab, bortezomib alone was administered during Cycle 1, and rituximab was introduced with
Cycle 2. Patients who had evidence of a response or stable
disease continued therapy for a maximum of 5 cycles.
Patients who completed 5 induction cycles without evidence of disease progression were permitted to receive
additional maintenance rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for
4 doses and bortezomib 1.5 mg/m2 weekly for 2 doses every 6 months for up to 2 years. The 1.5 mg/m2 bortezomib dose was selected initially based on published phase 2
efficacy and safety data in patients with NHL1,3; however,
after 7 of the first 11 patients experienced grade 3 neurologic toxicities, the study was amended to decrease bortezomib to 1.3 mg/m2 for induction and maintenance
cycles.
The bortezomib dose was reduced 1.1 mg/m2 for
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or for
grade 2 sensory, motor, or autonomic neuropathy. For
grade 3 sensory, motor, or autonomic neuropathy or for a
second occurrence of grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity,
the bortezomib dose was reduced to 0.9 mg/m2. Patients
with grade 4 neurologic toxicity were removed from the
study. Bortezomib dose reductions below 0.9 mg/m2 were
not permitted. Response was evaluated by computed tomography scans after 3 cycles and 5 cycles of induction
therapy and every 6 months during follow-up according
to 1999 International Response Criteria.13
Proteasome Inhibition and Fcc Receptor
Polymorphisms
To assess bortezomib-induced proteasome inhibition,
whole blood was collected immediately pretreatment and
at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after bortezomib dosing on Days 1 and 8 of Cycles 1 and 2.
The percentage of proteasome inhibition was determined
according to previously described methods.14

Original Article

FccRIIa (CD32a) and FccRIIIa (CD16a) genotypes
were determined from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) that were obtained from the study patients pretreatment. Genomic DNA was isolated from PBMCs
using the QIAampDNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc.,
Valencia, Calif). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was used to amplify DNA fragments that contained the
single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) sites. For the
CD16a 158 valine (V) to phenylalanine (F) polymorphism (SNP rs396991), the following primers were used:
50 -TCCCAATCTGGCTTTCCCTTATGT-30 and 50 CCAACTCAACTTCCCAGTGTGAT-30 . For the
CD32a 131 histidine (H) to arginine (R) polymorphism
(rs1801274), the following primers were used: 50 GAATGGAAAATCCCAGAAATTCTCGC-30 and 50 CAACAGCCTGACTACCTATTACCTG-30 (modified
from Cartron et al15). There was a slight mismatch in the
primer sequences for the CD32a amplicon and the
genomic DNA. This allowed for the creation of a BstUI
restriction enzyme site, which could be used for genotyping, although all samples were sequenced. By using the
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc.), all PCR
products were purified and sent for DNA sequencing
using a 48-capillary Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA Analyzer(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). A modified
Sanger dideoxy chemistry method and the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (version 3.1),
data-collection software (version 3.0), and sequencinganalysis software (version 5.2) were used (Applied
Biosystems).
Statistical Methods
A 2-stage design with 16 patients in the first stage and 9
patients in the second stage, for a total of 25 patients, with
a type 1 error rate of 10% and power of 90%, was used to
test the hypothesis that the ORR with R-bortezomib was
at least 30% with a null hypothesis that the ORR was
<10%. Toxicity was reported according to version 3.0 of
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events.
The Fisher exact test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test were used to correlate binary variables and continuous
variables, respectively, including pretreatment patient
characteristics, diagnosis, number of weeks of R-bortezomib therapy, response, and percentage proteasome inhibition with grade 3 or 4 neurologic toxicity. The KaplanMeier method was used to estimate progression-free survival (PFS), which was measured from the time of trial
entry until disease progression or death, and overall sur-

vival (OS), which was measured from trial entry until
death. PFS was censored at the time of stem cell transplantation (SCT). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to
determine the association of percentage proteasome inhibition with response and toxicity. Relevant demographic
and clinical variables were compared by genotype using
t tests, Fisher exact tests, analyses of variance, and Pearson
chi-square tests, as appropriate. Patient PFS and OS were
compared by genotype using Kaplan-Meier plots, the logrank test, and the Wilcoxon-Breslow-Gehan test. Genotype and allele frequencies were assessed using the exact
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. Correlative study analyses were with the STATA software package (version
10.1; StataCorp, College Station, Tex). A 2-tailed P value
.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Combined R-Bortezomib in an In Vivo
Preclinical Model of MCL
To evaluate the in vivo activity of R-bortezomib, we performed a preclinical evaluation using a Hu-MCL-SCID
model engrafted with the Jeko cell line.11 The mean survival was 32 days, 39.5 days, 38.4 days, and 53.3 days for
the control, bortezomib, rituximab, and combined Rbortezomib groups, respectively. Pairwise log-rank tests
resulted in the following significant differences in survival
(Fig. 1): control versus combined R-bortezomib, P ¼
.0004; single-agent bortezomib versus combined R-bortezomib, P ¼ .003; and single-agent rituximab versus combined R-bortezomib, P ¼ .002. All mice (8 per group)
that were included in the analysis had significant tumor

Patient Characteristics
Twenty-five patients, including 14 patients with MCL
and 11 patients with follicular lymphoma, were enrolled
in the single-institution phase 2 study of R-bortezomib
and were evaluable for response and toxicity. Patient characteristics for all patients and by NHL subtype are detailed
in Table 1. The median age was 66 years (range, 35-81
years), the median number of previous therapies was 2
(range, 1-9), 3 patients (12%) underwent a previous autologous SCT, and 9 patients (36%) failed to respond to
their previous therapy. Twenty-four patients had previously received rituximab, 9 patients were refractory to rituximab, and all patients were bortezomib-naive. Eight
patients (73%) with follicular lymphoma had intermediate or high-risk Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index scores (ie, scores 2),16 and 11 patients

Treatment, Response, and Survival
Patients completed a median of 3 cycles of R-bortezomib
(range, 1-5 cycles) (Table 1). Six patients stopped after
Cycle 1 of therapy (bortezomib alone) because of either
neurologic toxicity (n ¼ 3) or rapid disease progression (n
¼ 3). Ten patients responded (ORR, 40%), including 5
complete responses (CRs), 4 unconfirmed CRs (CRus),
and 1 partial response (PR). Five of these responses were
observed in patients who received 1.5 mg/m2 bortezomib,
and 5 were observed in patients who received 1.3 mg/m2
bortezomib. In patients with follicular lymphoma, the
ORR was 55% (n ¼ 6 of 11 patients); and, in patients
with MCL, the ORR was 29% (n ¼ 4 of 13 patients). All
4 responding MCL patients had evidence of a CR by
Cycle 3 of R-bortezomib. In the responding patients with
follicular lymphoma, all 6 patients had evidence of a PR
after 3 cycles of R-bortezomib, and 5 of those patients

achieved a CR (1 patient) or a CRu (4 patients) after
Cycles 4 and 5. Two of 6 patients with follicular lymphoma who were refractory to their last rituximab-containing regimen responded to R-bortezomib.
No patients received maintenance R-bortezomib,
because all responding patients discontinued therapy
because of toxicity or to undergo SCT. Four patients
underwent SCT after 3 to 5 cycles of R-bortezomib.
Three patients with follicular lymphoma achieved stable
disease (SD) (n ¼ 1), a PR (n ¼ 1), or a CR (n ¼ 1) after
R-bortezomib and underwent autologous SCT (n ¼ 1) or
matched unrelated donor allogeneic SCT (n ¼ 2), respectively. One patient with MCL who had a CR after 3 cycles
of R-bortezomib underwent autologous SCT.
At a median follow-up of 21.5 months (range, 0.649 months), the median PFS in all 25 patients was 5.6
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 months to not
achieved [NA]), with an estimated 2-year PFS rate of 24%
(95% CI, 10%-53%) (Fig. 2, top). Eighteen patients progressed, and 4 patients were censored for PFS analysis at
the time of SCT. Three patients with SD, CR, and CRu
after R-bortezomib had not progressed 21 to 49 months
after study entry. The median PFS was 11.5 months
(95% CI, 8.0 months to NA) in patients with follicular
lymphoma and 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.6 months to NA)
in patients with MCL (Fig. 2, bottom). In responding
patients, the estimated 2-year PFS rate was 60% (95% CI,
20%-85%). Eight patients (6 with MCL and 2 with follicular lymphoma) died because of disease progression.
Toxicity and Dose Modifications
Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity consisted primarily of
neutropenia (20%) and thrombocytopenia (20%) (Table
2). Febrile neutropenia occurred in only 1 patient. Nonhematologic events included sensory neuropathy (36%),
fatigue (32%), diarrhea (12%), constipation (12%), and
orthostatic hypotension (12%) (Table 2). Seven patients
developed a grade 1 or 2 skin rash, and 5 of those patients
achieved a CR or a CRu with R-bortezomib therapy.
Fourteen patients discontinued protocol therapy because
of toxicity, which included neurotoxicity in 12 patients
and fatigue in 2 patients.
In total, 13 patients (52%) experienced grade 3 neurotoxicity, which consisted of constipation/ileus, sensory
neuropathy, motor neuropathy, or orthostatic hypotension. Seven of the first 11 patients (64%) who received 1.5
mg/m2 bortezomib developed grade 3 neurologic adverse
events, compared with 6 of 14 (43%) patients who
received 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib. Grade 1 or 2 sensory

12 of the 25 patients (48%) and preceded grade 3 neurologic events in 9 patients. In 3 patients with orthostatic
hypotension, there was no evidence of volume depletion,
sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or cardiac disease contributing to the orthostasis, and the symptoms resolved with the
discontinuation of bortezomib in 2 patients. One patient
required prolonged treatment with fludrocortisone for the
relief of symptomatic hypotension.

Proteasome Inhibition
In all 25 patients, maximum proteasome inhibition
occurred 30 minutes to 1 hour after bortezomib infusion,
and there were no significant differences in the percentage
of proteasome inhibition with the addition of rituximab
(Fig. 3). During Cycle 1 with bortezomib alone, the mean
 standard deviation proteasome inhibition measured 30
minutes after bortezomib infusion was 57.3%  8% on
Day 1 and 62.4%  10.3%, on Day 8. During Cycle 2
with combined R-bortezomib, the mean  standard deviation proteasome inhibition measured 30 minutes after
bortezomib infusion was 58.6%  8.8% on Day 1 and
56%  10.9% on Day 8. The peak proteasome inhibition
on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 failed to correlate with
response (P ¼ .18 and P ¼ .44, respectively).
Fcc Receptor Polymorphisms
Twenty-two of 25 patients had samples available for
CD16a and CD32a genotyping. The CD16a 158 V!F
(SNP rs396991) genotype frequencies were VV in 2
patients, FV in 11 patients, and FF in 9 patients. The
CD16a genotype was not associated significantly with
age, sex, tumor type (follicular lymphoma or MCL),
stage, response, or PFS (data not shown). The CD32a
131 H!R (SNP rs1801274) genotype frequencies were
RR in 9 patients, RH in 4 patients, and HH in 9 patients.
On the basis of the allelic frequencies, the CD32a genotype frequencies were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P ¼ .003), with fewer heterozygotes (RH) in the
study population than expected by chance. The CD32a
genotype was not associated significantly with age, sex, tumor type, stage, or CD16a genotype (data not shown).

Figure 3. This chart illustrates the percentage of proteasome
inhibition achieved in 25 patients on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1
(bortezomib alone) and Cycle 2 (rituximab plus bortezomib).
No significant difference was observed in bortezomibinduced peak proteasome inhibition with the addition of rituximab to Cycle 2.

However, all heterozygotes (RH) progressed, compared
with 33% and 11% of HH and RR homozygotes, respectively (P ¼ .01; Fisher exact test: RH vs RR and HH combined). RH heterozygotes also had a shortened PFS (P ¼
.009; Wilcoxon-Breslow-Gehan test) (Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
Preclinical in vitro data in MCL and rituximab-resistant
cell lines demonstrated that R-bortezomib leads to synergistic apoptosis by enhancing nuclear NF-jB and phospho-AKT depletion8 while increasing surface CD20
expression.10 Here, we provide further preclinical evidence supporting this synergy in an in vivo model of
human MCL that demonstrated improved OS when tumor-bearing animals were treated with R-bortezomib.
These encouraging preclinical data provided justification
for a phase 2 combination trial of R-bortezomib in
patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma and MCL, in
whom response rates of 55% and 29%, respectively, were
observed. Nine of the 10 responding patients achieved a
CR or a CRu, including all 4 responding patients with
MCL and 5 of 6 responding patients with follicular lymphoma, for a CR rate of 36% (29% in MCL and 45% in
follicular NHL). In addition, 2 responding patients were
rituximab-refractory, and 4 patients were able to proceed
to autologous or allogeneic SCT after R-bortezomib therapy. Other trials using R-bortezomib in patients with
relapsed follicular lymphoma or MCL have reported simi-

lar ORRs of 38% to 56%.18-20 In the frontline setting,
ORRs as high as 86% with CR rates of 36% have been
reported in patients with follicular lymphoma.21
Although the ORR observed in this and other phase
2 trials of R-bortezomib18-20 appears to be comparable to
the responses observed in previous phase 2 trials of singleagent bortezomib,1,3-5,22,23 the CR rate may be improved
with the addition of rituximab. In previous single-agent
trials, the reported ORRs were 15% to 77% (CR rates,
0%-22%) and 29% to 50% (CR rates, 4%-21%) in
patients with follicular lymphoma and MCL, respectively.1,3,4 In larger, recently published trials using 1.3 to
1.5 mg/m2 bortezomib twice weekly in previously treated
patients with MCL (PINNACLE trial5 [n ¼ 155] and
O’Connor et al23 [n ¼ 36]) and follicular NHL (Di Bella
et al22 [n ¼ 36] and O’Connor et al23 [n ¼ 22]), the ORR
rates were 33% (CR rate, 8%), 45% (CR rate, 17%)
13.3% (CR rate, 8%), and 41% (CR rate, 22%), respectively. Also, O’Connor et al noted that the median time to
response in patients with follicular NHL was 12 weeks
compared with 4 weeks in patients with MCL.23 Therefore, the improved CR rate with R-bortezomib observed
in the current trial is encouraging; however, randomized
studies will be required to determine whether R-bortezomib is more effective than bortezomib alone in patients
with relapsed, indolent NHL with regard to the ORR, the
CR rate, and PFS. In addition, responses to bortezomib
and R-bortezomib are delayed, particularly in patients
with follicular NHL; and, in future randomized trials,
patients with SD or PRs should continue for at least 3 or
4 cycles, because responses may improve with longer
treatment.

R-Bortezomib in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma/Baiocchi et al

In the current study, 13 of 24 patients (54%) experienced grade 3 neurologic toxicity, including sensory
neuropathy, motor neuropathy, hypotension, and constipation/ileus. These neurologic events prevented patients
from receiving maintenance therapy. The rate of neurotoxicity was highest in the patients who received 1.5 mg/m2
bortezomib (64%) and declined with the use of the 1.3
mg/m2 dose (43%). If the neurologic events are limited to
peripheral neuropathy only, then the incidence of peripheral neuropathy (40%) in the current trial still exceeds the
8% to 13% rate reported in previous single-agent trials
using the 1.5 mg/m2 bortezomib dose1,3,23 and the 6% to
20% incidence reported with 1.3 mg/m2.4,5,22,24 With
combined R-bortezomib, De Vos et al observed a
decreased risk of peripheral neuropathy to 5% in patients
who received rituximab with 1.6 mg/m2 bortezomib
weekly compared with 10% in patients who received rituximab with 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib twice weekly.19 Efficacy
with the weekly bortezomib schedule appeared to be similar with an ORR of 43% compared with 49% using the
twice-weekly schedule,19 and it is possible that the use of a
weekly bortezomib schedule would further improve tolerability of this combination. However, despite this reduction in neuropathy with weekly bortezomib, the incidence
of neuropathy reported by De Vos et al still was significantly lower than that in the current study, and De Vos et
al did not describe grade 3 constipation/ileus or orthostatic
hypotension, which occurred in the current study. It
remains unclear which patients are at highest risk for these
neurologic events. In the current study, only the percentage proteasome inhibition and the achievement of a
response were associated significantly with neurologic toxicity. Surprisingly, previous use of other chemotherapeutic
agents associated with neurologic toxicity, the number of
weeks on protocol, and the development of grade 1 or 2
neurotoxicity failed to correlate with grade 3 or 4 events;
however, the analysis was limited by the small numbers of
patients on this trial. It is also unclear whether neurologic
toxicity was increased because of the combination of Rbortezomib or whether it was because of bortezomib alone.
Because 3 patients were taken off study for early neurotoxicity in the first cycle, in which bortezomib was administered alone, it appears unlikely that the rituximab
contributed to these events. Nevertheless, with combined
R-bortezomib, we recommend delivering bortezomib at a
dose of 1.3 mg/m2 and closely monitoring patients who
have previously received vincristine, patients who are
responding or receiving multiple cycles of therapy, and
patients who develop grade 1 or 2 neurotoxicity.

The association of SNPs within the Fcc receptor
genes (CD16a and CD32a) with respect to treatment
response also was evaluated in this study. The CD16a 158
V!F polymorphism was not associated significantly with
clinical outcomes in this study in contrast to previous
reports.15,25-27 Weng and Levy reported that patients
with follicular lymphoma who had a VV polymorphism
had an increased PFS with rituximab compared with VF
and FF individuals (534 days vs 170 days; P ¼ .023).26
However, other groups have not observed an effect of this
polymorphism on outcomes.28-31
With respect to the CD32a 131 H!R polymorphism, HH individuals in the current trial had a nonsignificantly decreased PFS compared with RR individuals, in
contrast to some studies,26,32 but not all studies.25,28-31
Weng and Levy reported that HH homozygotes with follicular lymphoma had significantly increased PFS compared with RR/RH individuals (445 days vs 158 days; P
¼ .01).26 In the current study, there also were fewer RH
heterozygotes than expected by chance, and they had a
statistically inferior outcome. Although the numbers were
small, the 4 RH individuals failed to respond to R-bortezomib and had a decreased PFS compared with the rest of
the cohort. The concordance of decreased numbers of RH
individuals in this cohort and decreased PFS (P ¼ .009)
may suggest that the RH genotype is an adverse risk factor
in follicular lymphoma and MCL. Recent studies have
demonstrated that the H-variant CD32 receptors have
higher binding affinity for immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1),
IgG2, and IgG3 and that CD32a RH heterozygotes predominantly use the H-allele for antibody binding, so HH
and RH individuals would not be expected to have a
decreased PFS.33 To our knowledge, other studies have
not reported a detrimental effect of the RH or HH
CD32a genotype, although other studies have grouped
RH and RR individuals together.31 Therefore, we interpret these findings cautiously and recommend that future
studies look specifically at the effect of rituximab on
response for each genotype individually and not group
RH and RR individuals together. In addition, the consequences of proteasome inhibition on Fcc receptor biology
are not well understood. Bortezomib may have obscured
the effects of these polymorphisms through alterations in
cellular signaling pathways.8
In conclusion, based on this trial and on several
phase 2 studies of R-bortezomib in patients with follicular
lymphoma and MCL,18-21 combination R-bortezomib is
an effective salvage regimen in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma and MCL and may sufficiently debulk

disease before allogeneic or autologous SCT. Although
the efficacy of R-bortezomib in heavily pretreated patients
with relapsed, indolent NHL is encouraging, the 52%
incidence of grade 3 neurotoxicity that led to early discontinuation of therapy in 12 patients tempers our enthusiasm for this combination using a twice-weekly schedule of
bortezomib. Therefore, currently, we would recommend
the use of R-bortezomib as pretransplantation salvage
therapy for patients who are eligible for SCT because of
the high ORR, but we would limit the total number of
cycles administered to minimize serious and potentially irreversible neurologic toxicity. A randomized phase 3 study
of R-bortezomib using a weekly schedule of bortezomib
compared with rituximab alone recently has been completed in over 600 patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma, and we await the results from that trial to
confirm the efficacy of this combination and to determine
the risk of neuropathy with weekly bortezomib
administration.
