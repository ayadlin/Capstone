ABSTRACT
Osteosarcoma is the most common bone tumors in children and adolescents.
Despite intensive chemotherapy, patients with advanced disease still have a poor
prognosis, illustrating the need for alternative therapies. In this study, we explored
the use of antibodies that block CD47 with a tumor growth suppressive effect on
osteosarcoma. We first found that up-regulation of CD47 mRNA levels in the tumorous
tissues from eight patients with osteosarcoma when compared with that in adjacent
non-tumorous tissues. Further western-blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)
demonstrated that CD47 protein level was highly expressed in osteosarcoma compared
to normal osteoblastic cells and adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Osteosarcoma
cancer stem cell markers staining shown that the majority of CD44+ cells expressed
CD47 albeit with different percentages (ranging from 80% to 99%). Furthermore,
high CD47 mRNA expression levels were associated with a decreased probability
of progression-free and overall survival. In addition, blockade of CD47 by specific
Abs suppresses the invasive ability of osteosarcoma tumor cells and further inhibits
spontaneous pulmonary metastasis of KRIB osteosarcoma cells in vivo. Finally,
CD47 blockade increases macrophage phagocytosis of osteosarcoma tumor cells.In
conclusion, our findings demonstrate that CD47 is a critical regulator in the metastasis
of osteosarcoma and suggest that targeted inhibition of this antigen by anti-CD47
may be a novel immunotherapeutic approach in the management of this tumor.

antigens expressed on tumor cells, specific antibodies
have demonstrated efficacy as cancer therapeutics.
Recent successful antibody-based strategies (PD-1
and CTLA-4) provided solid evidence on enhancing
antitumor immune responses by targeting immune cells,
irrespective of tumor antigens [4]. In addition, activation
of macrophage anti-tumor activity has been also an area of
active investigation, in particular regarding the blockade
of the binding between CD47 molecules and macrophage
signal regulatory protein-alpha (SIRPα). CD47 is a
transmembrane protein that acts as a self signal on normal
cells by inhibiting macrophage phagocytosis when CD47
binds to macrophage SIRPα [5]. Higher expression of
CD47 was also found in various malignancies, which was

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma is the most common histological form
of primary bone cancer, which shows most prevalent in
children and young adults [1]. Although about 90% of
patients are able to have limb-salvage surgery, 30–40%
of patients experience disease relapse and manifest
pulmonary metastasis [2]. In addition, only 20% of
patients can survive three years after relapse [3]. Based
on this clinical status, there is a clear and urgent need to
explore and develop new therapies aimed at preventing
osteosarcoma development and its pulmonary metastasis.
Immunomodulation to promote anti-tumor effects

considered as a mechanism by which cancer cells increase
their “selfness”, thus evading macrophage tumoral activity
[6–8]. Furthermore, patients with osteosarcoma tumors
that had higher CD47 expression fared poorly [9, 10].
These associations suggest the potential utility of CD47
blockade in the treatment of osteosarcoma. To address
this deficiency, we sought to evaluate the therapeutic
effects of CD47 blockade using specific antibodies
against osteosarcoma progression. We found that CD47
blockade could inhibit tumor growth in the xenograft
models of osteosarcoma. Furthermore, CD47 blockade
results in a significant increase in tumor phagocytosis by
macrophages.

CD47 mRNA expression levels predict survival

RESULTS

Effect of anti-CD47 Abs on osteosarcoma cell
invasion in vitro

To determine if CD47 mRNA expression levels
were a prognostic factor in patients with osteosarcoma, we
analyzed gene-expression data from a cohort of 30 patients
with osteosarcoma. In a univariate analysis, stratification
of patients into “CD47 high” (n = 20) and “CD47
low” (n = 10) groups based on an optimum threshold
revealed that high CD47 mRNA expression levels were
associated with a decreased probability of progression-free
(Figure 2A) and overall (Figure 2B) survival. These results
suggest that CD47 expression levels may be a clinically
relevant prognostic factor in osteosarcoma.

CD47 is highly expressed in osteosarcoma

We next analyzed whether anti-CD47 Abs could
inhibit the invasion of osteosarcoma cells through
Matrigel-coated filters. Murine osteosarcoma cell line,
LM8 cells and human osteosarcoma cell line, KRIB cells
that had been treated with either anti-CD47 Abs (B6H12,
100 μg/ml) or control IgG antibody for 4 days were placed
in the upper compartment of an invasion chamber in the
presence of either anti-CD47 Abs (100 μg/ml) or IgG
antibody. After 22 h, the cells on the lower surface were
counted. Osteosarcoma cells treated with anti-CD47 Abs
exhibited significantly less invasion than did IgG-treated
cells (LM8: P < 0.001, Figure 3A and KRIB: P < 0.001,
Figure 3B). These results indicated that blockade of
CD47 by specific Abs inhibits the invasive ability of
osteosarcoma tumor cells during tumor intravasation and
extravasation. We further used the MTT cell proliferation
assay to measure cell viability after incubation with
IgG control, B6H12 and Ab400 antibodies. Within each
antibody concentration and duration of exposure, there
was no significantly difference of the viability of normal
osteoblastic cells and osteosarcoma tumor cells treated
with CD47 blocking antibody (B6H12 and Ab400),
IgG and no antibody conditions (data not shown). This
result suggested that the therapeutic effect of anti-CD47
antibodies is unlikely to be inducing direct toxicity to the
tumor cells.

To get a first insight into the role of CD47 in
osteosarcoma, we evaluated CD47 expression in freshly
isolated osteosarcoma tissues and adjacent non-tumorous
tissues. We found that up-regulation of CD47 mRNA
levels (Figure 1A) and protein (Figure 1B) levels in
the osteosarcoma tissues when compared with those of
normal osteoblastic cell lines and adjacent non-tumorous
tissues. However, there was no difference in beta-actin
expression at the mRNA and protein levels. To find how
CD47 expression was regulated during different stages
of osteosarcoma, we characterized CD47 reactivity
in 40 paraffin-embedded osteosarcoma samples with
different degrees of invasive behavior (20 osteosarcoma
samples). We could observe strongly up-regulation of
CD47 in 17 out of 20 osteosarcoma patients (Figure 1C)
compared to those without invasive features (n = 10)
(p < 0.001, Fisher’s test). There were no significant
difference of other clinic-pathological characteristics
like gender and age (data not shown). Because there
were no other DNA mutations and no dysregulated
methylation variation found in the promoter of CD47
gene by direct sequencing and bisulfate PCR-sequencing,
we concluded that up-regulation of CD47 likely occurs
at the transcriptional level and CD47 up-regulation
was associated with osteosarcoma metastasis. We next
assessed the percentage of CD47+ cells within the CD44,
[a well-established osteosarcoma cancer stem cell (CSC)
markers [11], subpopulation in a set of ten primary
patient-derived osteosarcoma cancer cell cultures,
and as shown in Figure 1D, the majority of CD44+
cells expressed CD47 albeit with different percentages
(ranging from 80% to 99%), which indicated that which
indicated that osteosarcoma CSCs are mostly confined to
CD47+ cells. These data suggested that targeting CD47
may achieve a reduction on the activity in osteosarcoma
cancer stem cells.

Anti-CD47 Abs inhibit spontaneous metastasis of
osteosarcoma cells in vivo
An animal model of osteosarcoma has been
established using the KRIB cell line. Most of the mice
with viable xenografts subsequently develop pulmonary
metastasis [12]. To study the effect of anti-CD47 Abs on
osteosarcoma growth in vivo, KRIB cells were injected into
the tibias of nude mice. After 3 days, the mice were randomly
allocated to two treatment groups (n = 20 each): anti-CD47

it was in IgG-treated control mice (Wilcoxon’s rank-sum
P < 0.0001). In the anti-CD47-treated group, two of the
15 mice developed pulmonary metastases. However, in the
IgG-treated group, 75% of the mice developed pulmonary
metastases. Figure 4B illustrates the presence and
absence of spontaneous lung metastasis (as determined
by H&E staining) in a representative control mouse
and an anti-CD47-treated mouse, respectively. Because
spontaneous lung metastases occur only in mice that
have established tumors from intratibially xenografted
KRIB cells, the incidence of lung metastasis occurring
in mice with established bone tumors was 2 of 15
(13%) in anti-CD47-treated mice and 12 of 16 (75%) in
IgG-treated mice (Wilcoxon’s rank-sum P < 0.0001 for
both comparisons). These results demonstrated that antiCD47 inhibited spontaneous pulmonary metastasis in mice

fluid was extracted from these mice, and flow cytometry
for macrophage markers using F4/80 and CD11b were
performed. Macrophage and LM8, KRIB tumor cells
incubation with control antibodies IgG resulted in low
levels of tumor phagocytosis by macrophages. In contrast,
CD47 blockade using B6H12 and Ab400 resulted in
significantly higher rates of macrophage phagocytosis
(Figure 5A-5C). These results strongly suggest that CD47
blockade in vivo may lead to enhanced phagocytic activity
of macrophages against osteosarcoma.

DISCUSSION
CD47 exerts its anti-phagocytic role through binding
to phagocytic cells that express SIRPα [15]. Upon binding,
CD47 initiates a signal transduction cascade resulting in
inhibition of phagocytosis. Recently, CD47 was reported
to be a marker of tumor-initiating cells in leukemia
and bladder cancer [16]. In this study, we found that CD47+
cells have higher capacity in osteosarcoma tumorigenicity
and metastasis, when compared with CD47− counterparts.
Similar to the studies in glioma and ovarian cancer [17],
we found that a higher CD47 mRNA level in osteosarcoma
samples correlated with a poorer clinical outcome. In
addition, CD47 was detected in all primary and xenograft
samples from osteosarcoma patients. These results have
demonstrated that a CD47 population in osteosarcoma was
universal. These observations suggest that CD47 may be

an attractive target for potential therapeutic intervention
against osteosarcoma.
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have
been known for its important roles in tumor behavior,
depending on their polarization [18, 19]. M1, classically
activated TAMs, can mediate anticancer effects by
eliciting antitumor-adaptive immunity mechanisms that
include phagocytosis. In contrast, M2, alternatively
activated TAMs, suppress adaptive immunity and promote
a tumor microenvironment (TME) that can augment cancer
progression. The TME’s role as a nonneoplastic component
of tumors has been studied extensively in carcinomas but
remains less well characterized in sarcomas [20, 21]. In
our present work, we have explored the feasibility of
an alternative potential approach to treat osteosarcoma,
which allows macrophages to exert their M1 phenotype
by removing inhibitory factors for phagocytosis. Our
results demonstrated that CD47 blockade in vivo may lead
to enhanced phagocytic activity of macrophages against
osteosarcoma (Figure 5). Future studies will address
the ability of anti-CD47 Abs to eliminate established
osteosarcoma metastases before and following surgical
resection of the primary tumor, mimicking treatment of
metastatic disease in the clinical setting.
Emerging evidence suggests TAMs support tumor
progression and metastasis [22]. TAMs participate in
the development of a microenvironment conducive to
tumor growth through remodeling of extracellular matrix
and release of factors that promote cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, and migration [23]. We demonstrated that
blockade of CD47 signaling also enable TAMs to attack
tumor cells that they would otherwise disregard. Given
that TAMs are present in large numbers within tumors, it’s
possible that anti-CD47 antibody therapy has the potential
to restore TAM immunosurveillance and fundamentally
alter the role of macrophages in tumor biology.
In conclusion, we have found that CD47 was
over expressed on primary osteosarcoma. We provided
evidence that antibody that block CD47 is a potential and
effective treatment for osteosarcoma in vivo. We anticipate
that CD47 therefore serves as an attractive target for tumor
therapy on osteosarcoma.

Tumor xenograft models
Animal experiments were approved by the Animal
Care Committee of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital,
and were conducted according to institutional guidelines
for animal care. LM8 is an isolated variant of a murine
osteosarcoma cell line, Dunn osteosarcoma, which can
metastasize to distant organs at a high rate [24]. For
subcutaneous implantation, LM8 cells were suspended
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 100 μl of cell
suspension (1 × 106 cells) was injected subcutaneously
under the dorsal skin of C3H male mice at day 0. The
C3H male mice were provided by SLRC laboratory animal
company, Shanghai, China. The anti-CD47 monoclonal
antibody (mAbs) B6H12 and Ab400 was purified from
hybridomas. The mice were randomly divided into three
groups (n = 20 mice/group) for B6H12, Ab400 and isotype
Abs treatment. Antibodies were administrated as follow.
Aliquots of 0.2 mg of B6H12, Ab400 were injected
intraperitoneally into C3H mice at −7, −2, 2, 7, 14, and
19 days after LM8 transplantation. Normal rat IgG was
used as a control group and injected in the same manner
as for the B6H12 and Ab400 groups.

Evaluation
Mice were sacrificed and anti-CD47 inhibitory
effects were examined 4 weeks after LM8 transplantation.
The wet weight of removed subcutaneous tumors was
measured, and excised lungs were fixed with formalin.
Fixed organs were then embedded in paraffin, sectioned
(6 μm thickness), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
for histological observation. The number of metastatic
colonies in lungs was counted under a light microscope
(Nikon ECLIPSE 80i) with the selected midline section.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study has been approved by the Ethical
Committee of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital;
written informed consent was obtained from all subjects
or their parents in the case of children. This work received
approval from the institution ethics committee and
conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Histological analysis
Lungs were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and
sections cut at 5 μm thickness. For histological analysis
of lung tumours, 2.5 μm sections from at least two
different central planes of the lungs were cut, stained with
haematoxylin and eosin and scanned with TissueFaxs
software (TissueGnostics GmbH). Quantification of
tumour area, tumour number and tumour grade was done
with HistoQuest software (TissueGnostics GmbH) and

(Life technologies). The stained sections were imaged and
immunofluorescence intensity was measured using NISElements Microscope Imaging Software (Nikon).

Real-time PCR

Flow cytometry

Total RNA was isolated from tumor tissues of
patients with osteosarcoma using Qiagen RNA isolation
kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II
reverse transcriptase with random hexamers (Life
Technologies). To quantitate the expression of human
CD47 mRNA, real-time PCR was performed using iQ
SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Melting
curve analysis was done at the end of the reaction to assess
the quality of the final PCR products. The threshold cycle
C(t) values were calculated by fixing the basal fluorescence
at 0.05 units. Three replicates were used for each sample,
and the average C(t) value was calculated.  The ΔC(t)
values were calculated as C(t) sample - C(t) GAPDH. The
N-fold increase or decrease in expression was calculated
by the ΔΔCt method using the C(t)GAPDH value as the
reference point.

Cells were adjusted to a concentration of
106 cells/mL in sorting buffer [1X PBS; 3% FBS (v/v);
3 mmol/L EDTA (v/v)] before analysis or sorting with a
FACS Canto II or FACS Influx instrument, respectively
(BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated with Abs for
30 min at 4°C in PBS containing 1% bovine serum
albumin. To identify distinct cancer (stem) cells,
the following antibodies were used: phycoerythrinconjugated anti-CD4 mAb (Biomeda, Foster City, CA);
CD47-APC or appropriate isotype-matched control
antibodies (all from BD Biosciences). Following
incubation, cells were washed, resuspended in 300 μl
of PBS, and assayed using a fluorescence-activated cell
sorter (FACScan; BD Bioscience). DAPI was used for
exclusion of dead cells. For this experiment, at least three
mice were used. Data were analyzed with FlowJo 9.2
software (Tree Star).

Western blotting
Protein samples (25 μg/lane) were subjected to
SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Life technologies). The resultant
membranes were blocked with 5% milk-TBST for 1 h
at room temperature and then incubated with anti-CD47
Ab (Abcam) overnight at 4°C, washed with TBST,
incubated with appropriate secondary antibody (1:5000;
Jackson ImmunoResearch) conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase, washed, and visualized with ECL Western
Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences).
After stripping with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer
(Pierce) for 20 min at room temperature, membranes were
processed similarly with anti-beta-actin antibody (1:2, 000
dilution, Abcam) as a loading control.

1 hour, followed by nuclear counterstaining with Hoechst

For in vitro phagocytosis assay, 5 × 104 macrophages
were plated per well in a 24-well tissue-culture plate.
Peritoneal macrophages were isolated following injection
of 1 mL 3% thioglycollate medium into the peritoneal
cavity of 6 week old NOD/SCID/IL2γnull (NSG) mice
provided by SLRC laboratory animal company, Shanghai,
China. LM8 tumor cells were labeled with 2.5 μM
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Life Technologies).
Macrophages were incubated in serum-free medium
for 2 h before adding 2 × 105 CFSE-labeled LM8 cells.
