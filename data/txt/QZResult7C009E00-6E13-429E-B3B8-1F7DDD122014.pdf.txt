Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recognition of modified histones by “reader” proteins plays a critical role in the regulation of
chromatin1. H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) is deposited onto the nucleosomes in the
transcribed regions following RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation. In yeast, this mark in turn
recruits epigenetic regulators to reset the chromatin to a relatively repressive state thus suppressing

cryptic transcription2. However, much less is known about the role of H3K36me3 in transcription
regulation in mammals. This is further complicated by the transcription-coupled incorporation of
the histone variant H3.3 in gene bodies3. Here we show that the candidate tumor suppressor
ZMYND11 specifically recognizes H3K36me3 on H3.3 (H3.3K36me3) and regulates Pol II
elongation. Structural studies reveal that in addition to the trimethyl-lysine binding by an aromatic
cage within the PWWP domain, the H3.3-dependent recognition is mediated by the encapsulation
of the H3.3-specific “Ser31” residue in a composite pocket formed by the tandem bromo-PWWP
domains of ZMYND11. ChIP-sequencing analyses reveal a genome-wide colocalization of
ZMYND11 with H3K36me3 and H3.3 in gene bodies, and its occupancy requires the predeposition of H3.3K36me3. Although ZMYND11 is associated with highly expressed genes, it
functions as an unconventional transcription corepressor via modulating Pol II at the elongation
stage. ZMYND11 is critical for the repression of a transcriptional program that is essential for
tumor cell growth; low expression level of ZMYND11 in breast cancer patients correlates with
worse prognosis. Consistently, overexpression of ZMYND11 suppresses cancer cell growth in
vitro and tumor formation in mice. Together, this study identifies ZMYND11 as an H3.3-specific
reader of H3K36me3 that links the histone variant-mediated transcription elongation control to
tumor suppression.

ZMYND11 (a.k.a. BS69) is an adenovirus E1A-interacting protein that functions as a
corepressor of E1A and cellular transcription factors including the c-Myb and ETS-2
oncoproteins4-6. It contains several histone “reader” modules, including a plant
homeodomain (PHD), a bromodomain, and a PWWP domain (Fig. 1a), indicating a role in
chromatin regulation. To determine whether these domains can recognize histone
modification(s), we utilized a histone peptide array (Supplementary Table 1) and found that
the recombinant PHD-bromo-PWWP (PBP) domains specifically bound H3K36me3
peptides (Fig. 1b), which was also confirmed by peptide pull-down assays (Fig. 1c). In
addition, ZMYND11 PBP also bound H3K36me3 on bulk histones and the reconstituted
H3K36-specific methyl-lysine analog-containing nucleosomes (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b).
Several PWWP domains can recognize methylation on histone H3K36 or H3K797-9;
therefore we asked whether ZMYND11 PWWP alone was able to bind H3K36me3. The
results revealed that neither the isolated PWWP nor the PHD and bromodomain bound
H3K36me3, whereas the tandem bromo-PWWP (BP) retained a weak interaction (Fig. 1d
and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed a Kd of 56 μM
for PBP and 71 μM for BP to the H3K36me3 peptide, whereas weak or no binding to di-,
mono-methylated and the un-methylated H3K36 peptides (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig.
1d). Furthermore, deletion of the PWWP, bromo, or PHD domain greatly diminished fulllength ZMYND11 binding to H3K36me3 peptide and chromatin, whereas deletion of the
MYND domain had no effect (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f).
To gain molecular insights into the reader function of ZMYND11, we solved the crystal
structure of the tandem BP domains in its free state and in complex with H3K36me3 peptide
at 1.95 Å and 2.0 Å, respectively (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Discussion).
Successful crystallization of the BP-H3K36me3 complex was facilitated by alanine mutation
of D234 and E236 within the bromodomain to disrupt unfavorable packing contacts without
affecting protein folding and histone binding (Extended Data Fig. 2a-e). The tandem Bromo-

PWWP domains adopt a V-shaped structure imparted by a “kink” around a previously
uncharacterized zinc finger (ZnF) motif (Fig. 1f, g). Several structural features imply that
ZMYND11 bromodomain is unlikely a histone acetyllysine-binding module (Extended Data
Fig. 2f-l). The PWWP domain adopts a five-bladed β-barrel fold with an extended Cterminal α-helix (αP), with a conserved H3K36me3-binding aromatic cage7-9 formed by
F291 and W294 of the β1-β2 loop and F310 of the β3-β4 loop (Fig. 1h and Extended Data
Fig. 3a-c). Alanine mutations abrogated ZMYND11 binding to the H3K36me3 peptide and
chromatin without affecting the overall protein folding (Figs. 1i, 2i and Extended Data Fig.
3d-f). Despite extensive interactions observed in crystals for the histone peptide, the
relatively weak binding affinity suggests that an alternative binding mechanism is plausible.
In deed, PWWP domain was previously identified as a DNA-binding motif10. Consistent
with a recent report11, we found that ZMYND11 BP bound to DNA at low micromolar level
(Extended Data Fig. 3g). The higher binding affinity for DNA than that for histone peptides
is in agreement with observations for some other PWWP domains12,13. Although not
detected in our pulldowns using peptides and oligos, all these features suggest that a synergy
between histone and DNA may contribute to ZMYND11 binding at the nucleosomal level
(Supplementary Discussion).

The H3K36me3 peptides used in the biochemical and structural studies were histone H3.3based peptides (Fig. 2a). The histone variant H3.3 possesses a signature motif
“S31⋯A87AIG90” that is distinct from the “A31…S87AVM90” sequence signature of the
canonical histone H3.1/23. Our structure revealed that the H3.3-specific “S31” residue and
its neighboring T32 were encapsulated at the bottom of the “Bromo-ZnF-PWWP” valley
(Fig. 2b), contributing to the ZMYND11-H3 interactions in addition to the binding of
K36me3 by the PWWP aromatic cage. Indeed, the binding of ZMYND11 to H3.3K36me3
was much stronger than its binding to the H3.1 counterpart, with 7-8 fold difference in
binding affinity (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Furthermore, Flag-tagged histone
H3.3, but not H3.1 strongly co-immunoprecipitated ZMYND11 in cells (Extended Data Fig.
4c). Together, these results suggest that the H3.3-specific S31 residue is indispensable for
ZMYND11-H3K36me3 interaction.

We also solved the structure of ZMYND11 BP-H3.1K36me3 complex at 2.3 Å for
comparison (Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 4d). A number of hydrogen
bonding interactions around the “A29-G33” segment in the BP-H3.3 complex were lost in the
BP-H3.1 complex following the “Ser to Ala” conversion at position 31 (Fig. 2e,f and
Extended data Fig. 4e,f). Superimposition of the complex structures revealed a
conformational adjustment of the H3.1 “A29-G33” segment (Fig. 2e), indicating a non-ideal
encapsulation. As highlighted in the Ligplot diagram14, eight direct hydrogen bonds and two
sets of water-mediated hydrogen bonding were detected upon H3.3 variant binding (Fig. 2g),
whereas only three direct hydrogen bonds and two sets of water-mediated hydrogen bonding
were observed for H3.1 recognition (Fig. 2h). Notably, residues from all three modules,
bromo, ZnF and PWWP, contributed to the A29-G33 segment recognition through the
formation of a composite pocket, calling attention to the theme of “module integration” for
extended reader function15. Unique hydrogen bonding interactions for the H3.3-specific
readout were particularly supplied by “R168-A29”, “E251-S31”, “E254-T32” and “N266S31” of the ZMYND11-H3.3 pair along with an adaptive flipping of the R168 side chain

(Fig. 2e, g), and mutations diminished the bindings (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 4g).
Together, the results strongly support a role of ZMYND11 as an H3.3-specific reader of
H3K36me3.
We next sought to determine whether ZMYND11 colocalizes with H3K36me3 and the H3.3
variant in the genome by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput
sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis. We identified 9,759 ZMYND11 peaks distributed over
3,353 genes in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells (Supplementary Table 2). The peaks were
highly enriched in intron and exon (herein defined as gene body) but not promoter (Fig. 3a).
Strikingly, the average distribution of all ZMYND11-bound peaks recapitulated the genomic
distribution of H3K36me316 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 3): absent from transcription
start site (TSS), but gradually increased in gene body towards the 3’ end and peaked at the
transcription termination site (TTS).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also determined the genome-wide distribution of histone variant H3.3 by ChIP-seq
analysis of Flag-H3.3 stably expressed in U2OS cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a and
Supplementary Table 4). In accordance to previous observations17-19, H3.3 was distributed
in both the promoter and the body of active genes (Extended Data Fig. 5b). The gene bodyassociated H3.3 showed a strong co-occupancy with H3K36me3 (Fig. 3c). Importantly, two
thirds of all the ZMYND11-bound genes overlapped with H3K36me3 and H3.3-co-occupied
genes (P< 1e-465) (Fig. 3c), as also represented by a genome-browser view of the ChIP-seq
signals (Fig. 3d). High ZMYND11 occupancies were observed in genes enriched with both
H3K36me3 and H3.3, whereas ZMYND11 occupancies were much lower in genes only
decorated with H3K36me3 or H3.3 (Fig. 3e-g). Importantly, depletion of ZMYND11 by
shRNAs drastically diminished the ChIP-seq signals (Extended Data Fig. 5c-g), suggesting
that the ChIP data obtained using our ZMYND11 antibody reflect the endogenous
ZMYND11 chromatin-binding pattern.

ZMYND11 densities in gene bodies were directly correlated with H3K36me3 levels
(Extended Data Fig. 6a), we then asked whether ZMYND11 occupancy was H3K36me3
dependent. We found that ZMYND11 binding on target genes was reduced along with
diminished H3K36me3 levels in the SETD220 knockdown cells (Fig. 3h and Extended Data
Fig. 6b-d), but not in the NSD2 (an H3K36me2 methyltransferase)21 knockdown cells where
the H3K36me3 levels remained largely unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Furthermore,
the H3.3K36me3 recognition-deficient mutants of ZMYND11 were severely impaired in
binding on target genes (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). Taken together, these results
strongly suggest that ZMYND11 colocalizes with H3K36me3 and H3.3 in gene body, and
its occupancy requires the pre-deposition of trimethylation on H3.3K36.
To identify ZMYND11-regulated genes genome-wide, we performed RNA-seq analysis in
U2OS cells. We found that 268 genes were upregulated and 370 genes downregulated upon
ZMYND11 depletion (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 7a-c and Supplementary Table 5). Gene
ontology analysis revealed that the upregulated genes in ZMYND11 knockdown cells were
specifically enriched in small cell lung cancer and focal adhesion pathways; in contrast, the
downregulated genes were not enriched in any pathways (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table
5). IPA disease association analysis of the upregulated genes also revealed a high

enrichment in cancer (Fig. 4b). These data suggest that ZMYND11 has a role in both
transcriptional repression and activation, but it specifically represses oncogene expression.

Because ZMYND11 is localized in gene body, we postulated that ZMYND11 regulates gene
expression at the transcription elongation rather than the initiation step. Gene body Pol II
density correlates well with transcription elongation rate22,23, we therefore determined the
changes of Pol II density upon ZMYND11 depletion. ZMYND11 occupancies were
enriched in genes with high Pol II densities (P <1x10-401) (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b and
Supplementary Table 6). Upon ZMYND11 depletion, we observed increased Pol II
occupancy specifically on ZMYND11-repressed genes (Fig. 4c,d and Extended Data Fig.
8c). Notably, only the level of the intragenic Pol II, especially Pol II near the 3’ end of gene
body, was markedly increased, whereas the promoter-associated Pol II remained largely
unchanged (Fig. 4c,d). Similar increases were also observed for the elongation-specific Pol
II that is phosphorylated at serine 2 (S2P)24 and the intragenic H3K36me3 levels (Fig. 4c
and Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). The phenomenon of specific increase of Pol II in gene body
was further supported by the quantified Pol II traveling ratio22 (Extended Data Fig. 8f).
Together, these data suggest that ZMYND11 occupancy correlates with Pol II density in
gene body, and ZMYND11 represses gene expression by preventing the transition of paused
Pol II to elongation.

ZMYND11 is downregulated in multiple human cancers including breast cancer (Extended
Data Fig. 9a), indicating that ZMYND11 is a candidate tumor suppressor25. Overexpression
of the WT ZMYND11 inhibited tumor cell growth, whereas the H3.3K36me3 bindingdeficient mutants exhibited severe defects in suppressing cell proliferation and survival in
both U2OS and the invasive MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells (Fig. 4e and Extended Data
Fig. 9b-e). Furthermore, in a mouse xenograft study using MDA-MB 231 cells, we found
that compared with mice injected with control cells, tumor formation was strongly
suppressed in mice injected with cells expressing WT ZMYND11, whereas the
H3.3K36me3-binding deficient mutant W294A was severely impaired in suppressing tumor
growth in vivo (Fig. 4f). Interestingly, D307N, a missense mutation identified in colon and
rectum adenocarcinoma patients (Extended Data Fig. 9f), diminished ZMYND11 binding to
H3.3K36me3 (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 9g-i) and its tumor suppressor function in
mice (Fig. 4f). Taken together, these results suggest that ZMYND11 suppresses phenotypes
of cancer cells in a manner that depends on its H3.3K36me3-binding activity. Consistent
with these experimental results, low ZMYND11 expression levels in breast cancer patients
correlate with worse disease-free survivals (Fig. 4g and Extended Data 9j,k).
In summary, we have identified ZMYND11 as an H3.3-specific reader of H3K36me3. To
our knowledge, it represents the first variant-specific reader of methylated histones. The
combination of H3K36me3 and H3.3 establishes a unique epigenetic state that defines the
genomic distribution of ZMYND11, offering a spatiotemporal control of gene expression for
both normal and neoplastic growth. Because both H3K36me3 and H3.3 are deposited into
the chromatin along with elongating Pol II, ZMYND11 is likely to be recruited to gene
bodies only after one or multiple rounds of transcription when sufficient H3.3K36me3 is
accumulated. We propose that, rather than as an on/off switch, ZMYND11 mainly functions
in “fine-tuning” gene expression by modulating Pol II elongation.

Our findings also underscore the importance of the histone variant H3.3 in tumor
suppression. Frequent mutations of the H3.3-encoding H3F3A gene have recently been
identified in pediatric glioblastoma26,27. Unlike the K27M mutation in a single copy of
H3.3-encoding gene that affects the global H3K27 methylation levels, the G34V/R
mutations only alter the H3K36me3 levels at certain genes28,29. Interestingly, the G34V/R
mutations impaired ZMYND11 binding to the H3.3K36me3 peptide (Extended data Fig. 9l).
It remains an open question whether disruption of the binding of ZMYND11, or other yet
unknown H3.3K36me3 readers, has a physiological impact on the pathogenesis of pediatric
glioblastoma.

Human and mouse ZMYND11 cDNA were cloned into pENTR3C and subsequently cloned
into pBABE-FLAG, p3FLAG, pCAG-Myc, and pGEX destination vectors using Gateway
techniques (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding the PHD-Bromo-PWWP (PBP, aa74-371) and
Bromo-PWWP (BP, 154-371) of mouse ZMYND11 was cloned into the pGEX-6P1 and
pET-28a vectors (Novagen). Point mutations were generated using site-direct mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene). Histone peptides bearing different modifications were synthesized at the

Peptide microarray and peptide pull-down assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Peptide microarray and peptide pull-down assays were performed as described
previously32,33. Briefly, biotinylated histone peptides were printed in triplicate onto a
streptavidin-coated slide (PolyAn) using a VersArray Compact Microarrayer (Bio-Rad).
After a short blocking with biotin (Sigma), the slides were incubated with the GST-fused
ZMYND11 PBP or other desired proteins in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 300 mM
NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, 20% fetal bovine serum) overnight at 4°C with gentle
agitation. After being washed with the same buffer, the slides were probed with an anti-GST
primary antibody and then a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized using
a GenePix 4000 scanner (Molecular Devices). For the peptide pull-down assays, 1 μg of
biotinylated histone peptides with different modifications were incubated with 1-2 μg of
GST-fused proteins in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 1
mM PMSF) overnight. Streptavidin beads (Amersham) were added to the mixture, and the
mixture was incubated for 1 hr with rotation. The beads were then washed three times and
analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To preserve the weak binding between

ZMYND11 PBP and histone H3.1K36me3, mild buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 200 mM
NaCl, 0.05% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF) was used for binding and washes. Other steps are
essentially the same as described above.
Histone binding, nucleosome preparation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Full-length histone pull-down assays were performed as described previously34. Briefly, 10
μg of full-length histones purified from calf thymus (Wormington) were incubated with 25
μg of recombinant proteins for 4 hours to overnight in a binding solution containing 50 mM
Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 0.05% NP-40. Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads
(Amersham) were added to the solution for 1 hour. The beads were then washed 6 times and
bound histones were detected using Western blot analysis.
Recombinant Xenopus histones were individually purified and reconstituted into histone
octamers using a previously described protocol 35. All histone H3K36 methylated histones
were prepared using the Methyl-Lysine Analog (MLA) approach36. The chemical reactions
result in almost all lysines being converted to methylation mimics, as was confirmed by
mass spectrometry analysis and Western blotting.

EMSA for nucleosome binding were performed as described previously35. EMSA reactions
were carried out in a 15-ml system containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 4 mM
MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol, and 0.1mM PMSF. Primer pairs (5’
ACAGGATGTATATATCTGACACGTGCCTGG 3’) and (5’
TGACCAAGGAAAGCATGATTCTTCACAC 3’) were designed to generate the 216 bp
mono-nucleosome probe by using plasmid pBL386 as template followed by P32 exchange
reaction for labeling. MLA-nucleosomes and indicated proteins were premixed in EMSA
buffer and incubated at 30°C for 1 hour. Then, the total reactions were directly loaded onto a
4% native polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1) in 0.3 × TBE. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4°C
for 3.5 hours.
Crystallization, data collection, and structural determination

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ZMYND11 BP domains were cloned into pET28 vector and expressed with N-terminal Histag in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) in the presence of 0.5 mM IPTG and 50 μM
ZnCl2. Overnight induced cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer:
300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na2HPO4, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.0, and 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Then cells were lysed via Emulsiflex C3 (Avestin) highpressure homogenizer. After centrifugation at 16,770 × g, the supernatant was applied to
HisTrap column (GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted with a linear imidazole
gradient from 50 to 500 mM. The resultant protein was further purified by cation-exchange
chromatography using HiTrap SP column (GE Healthcare). The peaks eluted under the
buffer condition: 600 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.0 was pooled and concentrated to
~20 mg/ml. D234A/E236A double mutant BP (BPDM) was generated by the QuickChange
site-direct mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), expressed and purified using essentially the same
procedure as for the wild type protein.

Crystallization was performed via the hanging drop vapor diffusion method under 18°C by
mixing equal volume (1-2 μl) of protein and reservoir solution. Free BP (8-10 mg/ml)
crystals were grown in the solution containing 8 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, and 0.1
M imidazole, pH 7.8. For complex crystallization, BPDM (8-10mg/ml) was first incubated
with histone peptides (SciLight Biotechnology, LLC) at molar ratio of 1: 10 for about 2
hours. Crystals of both H3.319-42K36me3 and H3.121-42K36me3 peptide-bound BPDM could
be obtained under 25 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 0.2 M
Li2SO4.
Crystals were briefly soaked in a cryo-protectant composed of reservoir solution
supplemented with 20% glycerol, and was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection
at 100K. Wild type free BP data set was collected at beamline 1W2B at Beijing Synchrotron
Radiation Facility at 1.2825 Å – the zinc absorption edge. Complex data sets were collected
at beamline BL17U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility at 0.9793 Å for
H3.3K36me3 complex and at 1.0076 Å for H3.1K36me3 complex. All data were indexed,
integrated, and merged using the HKL2000 software package37. Data collection statistics are
shown in Extended Data Table 1.

The phase of free BP was solved by zinc single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method
using software PHENIX38. The BPDM-H3 peptide complex structures were solved by
molecular replacement using MOLREP39 with free BP structure as search model. All
structures were refined using PHENIX23, with iterative manual model building using
COOT 40. Model geometry was analyzed with PROCHECK 41. Ramachandran plot analysis
revealed 92.6%, 95.0%, 93.7% residues in most favored regions and 7.4%, 5.0%, 6.3%
residues in allowed regions for free BP, BPDM-H3.3 and BPDM-H3.1 complexes,
respectively. Detailed structural refinement statistics are shown in Extended Data Table 1.
All structural figures were created using program PYMOL (http://www.pymol.org/).
Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy

Purified proteins were prepared in buffer 25 mM Na2HPO4 pH 7.0, 500 mM (NH4)2SO4 by
overnight dialysis. CD spectra were recorded at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml under
15°C using an Applied Photo-physics Pistar π-180 spectropolarimeter with a 1 mm pathlength cell and a bandwidth of 3.0 nm. Spectra were scanned from 190 to 260 nm at an

three scans after the subtraction of buffer control.
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and biolayer interferometry (BLI) assays
For ITC measurement, synthetic histone H3.319-42K36me3 and H3.119-42K36me3 peptides
(SciLight Biotechnology, LLC) and the wild type and mutant BP or PBP proteins were
extensively dialyzed against ITC buffer: 0.5 M (NH4) 2SO4 and 25 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.0.
Protein and peptide concentration were measured based on their respective UV280nm
absorption. The titration was performed using MicroCal iTC200 system (GE Healthcare) at
15°C. The use of high salt (0.5 M (NH4) 2SO4) and low temperature (15°C) is critical to
prevent protein precipitation during the ITC titration. Each ITC titration consisted of 17
successive injections with 0.4 μl for the first and 2.42 μl for the rest. Usually, H3 peptides at

1.5 mM were titrated into BP or PBP at 0.07-0.1 mM. Corresponding “peptide to buffer” or
“buffer to protein” controls were performed for background correction. The resultant ITC
curves were processed using the Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab) according to the “One Set
of Sites” fitting model. Due to the low Wiseman c value of most titrations, the stoichiometry
(n value) was fixed at 1 for valid curve fitting 42.
GST and GST-tagged ZMYND11-BP proteins were immobilized onto anti-GST antibodycoated biosensors (Fortebio, Pall Life Sciences). After washed with binding buffer (25 mM
NaH2PO4 pH7.0, 150 mM KCl, and 2 mM MgCl2), the sensors were dipped into binding
buffers containing methylated or unmethylated double strand DNA at various concentrations
5 min for complete association followed by 5 min disassociation in binding buffer without
DNA. Kinetics were recorded using Octet RED96 (Fortebio, Pall Life Sciences) at 1000 rpm
vibration at 25 °C. Steady state analysis was performed using the equation: Response =
Rmax*Conc./[KD+Conc.] using Octet data analysis 7.0. DNA sequences (derived from the
Widom 601 sequence43) used in these assays are: unmethylated dsDNA: 5’CAGCTGAACATCGCTTTTGATG-3’; methylated dsDNA: 5’CAGCTGAACAT[5medC]GCTTTTGATG-3’.

Cell culture, viral transduction, and RNA interference
Human U2OS, HEK 293T and MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM
(Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Retroviral transduction was
performed as described previously32. Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with pVPackVSV-G, pVPack-GP (Stratagene), and pBABE-FLAG-ZMYND11, pQCXIP-ZMYND11 or
control vectors, and viral supernatants were harvested after 48 hours. For lentiviral shRNA
packaging, 293T cells were co-transfected with pMD2.G, pPAX2 (Addgene) and pLKOshRNA constructs. For infections, the cells were incubated with viral supernatants in the
presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene; after 48 hours, infected cells were selected with puromycin
(2 μg/ml). Cell proliferation and colony formation assays were performed as previously
described31.
Affinity purification, immunoprecipitation (IP), and co-IP

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously31,44. The nuclear extracts were
diluted with low salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100,
10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) to final NaCl concentration to 120 mM. 200 μl of 50% M2
FLAG-agarose beads were added to the nuclear extracts and incubated at 4° for overnight.
The beads were then washed with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 250 or 500 mM
KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT and
protease inhibitors) for 3-6 times, and eluted with 300 μl of 0.3 mg/ml FLAG peptide in
dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) at 4°C for 4 hours for
three times. The bound proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE and sent for mass
spectrometric analysis. LC/MS/MS analysis was performed in Harvard Taplin MS core
facility and UTMB MS core facility.
For immunoprecipitation (IP) or co-IP experiments, cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1

mM DTT, and a complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Antibodies conjugated with
protein A/G beads (Millipore) or anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) were
incubated with lysates overnight at 4°C. The beads were then washed 3-6 times with cell
lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted in SDS buffer and analyzed using Western
blotting.
ChIP and ChIP-seq Analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ChIP analysis was performed essentially as previously described32. Briefly, cells were
crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and the reaction was
stopped with 125 mM glycine. Nuclei were isolated by resuspending the cells in swelling
buffer containing 5 mM PIPES pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, 1% NP-40 and a complete protease
inhibitor for 20 min at 4°C. The isolated nuclei were resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50
mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) and sonicated using a Bioruptor Sonicator
(Diagenode). Samples were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies overnight at
4°C. After incubation with Staph A cells for 15 min, immunoprecipitates were washed twice
with dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2% Sarkosyl) and four times with
IP wash buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM LiCl, 1% NP-40, and 1% deoxycholic acid
sodium salt). After reverse crosslinking was performed, DNA was eluted, purified using
PCR purification kit (Qiagene), and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR on the ABI
7500-FAST System using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
ChIP-seq was carried out essentially the same as described above, except using proteinA/G
beads instead of Staph A cells for IP. Samples were sequenced using the Illumina Solexa
Hiseq 2000. The raw reads were mapped to human reference genome NCBI 36 (hg18) by
Solexa data processing pipeline, allowing up to 2 mismatches. The genome ChIP-seq
profiles were generated using MACS 1.3.645 with only unique mapped reads. Clonal reads
were automatically removed by MACS. The ChIP-seq profiles were normalized to
10,000,000 total tag numbers, and peaks were called at p-values ≤1e-8. For ZMYND11 and
H3K36me3 ChIP samples, peaks were annotated by REFSEQ genes that have overlaps
within TSS to TTS. For Pol II samples, peaks were annotated by REFSEQ genes that have
overlaps within TSS-3K to TTS. The ChIP-seq peaks distribution statistics were performed
using the Cis-regulatory element annotation system46. All ChIP-seq data are summarized in
Supplementary Table 7

RT-PCR, Northern, real-time PCR, and RNA-seq analysis
RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-PCR) and real-time PCR were performed as previously
described32. mRNA was prepared using the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen) and reversetranscribed using the First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Northern blotting and
hybridization were performed using Northern Max-Gly Kit (Invitrogen) following
manufacture instructions. 20 μg total RNA were used for each lane. Quantitative real-time
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on the ABI 7500-FAST Sequence Detection System
using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Gene expressions
were calculated following normalization to GAPDH levels using the comparative Ct (Cycle
threshold) method. Primer sequences are available upon request.

RNA-seq samples were sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq 2000, and raw reads were
mapped to human reference genome (hg18) and transcriptome using the RNA-Seq unified
mapper47. The reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) expression levels of BS69KD and
control were compared using EdgeR. Genes with RPKM < 5 in both the KD and control
samples were removed. Genes with a fold change ≥1.5 were selected as differential genes.
Gene Ontology analysis was performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resource 6.748.
Expression signatures and survival analysis
Survival analyses were performed as described previously30. The database that consists of
13 breast cancer expression profiling datasets from GEO was used in the “consolidated”
survival analysis through The Kaplan–Meier plotter central server. Data is loaded into the R
statistical environment, where calculations are performed. The package “survival” is used to
calculate and plot Kaplan–Meier survival curves, and the number-at-risk is indicated below
the main plot. P-values were calculated using logrank test. For data validation, independent
analysis of GEO datasets GSE6532 and GSE7390 were performed as previously
described49.

Tumor xenograft
All animal studies are in compliance with the ethical regulation at UT MD Anderson Cancer
Center. Female athymic nude mice (age 6–8 weeks) were obtained from NCI -Frederick and
animals were housed under pathogen-free conditions. 5×106 of MDA-MB 231 cells stably
expressing control pQCXIP vector, WT ZMYND11 or mutants were suspended in 100 μl of
serum free DMEM and injected subcutaneously onto the mice. The growth of tumors was
monitored by weekly examination until the largest tumor reach tumor burden. Tumor sizes
were measured using a caliper, and tumor volume was calculated according to the following
equation: tumor volume (mm3) = (length (mm) × width (mm)2) × 0.5. Representative data
were obtained from five mice per experimental group. Statistical analyses were performed
with one-way repeated- measures ANOVA.
