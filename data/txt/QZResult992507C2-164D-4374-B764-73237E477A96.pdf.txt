Abstract
Toll-like receptors (TLR) expressed on inflammatory cells play
a key role in host defense against pathogens, benefiting the
host. TLR are also expressed on tumor cells. To evaluate the
role of TLR in tumor cells, we investigated TLR4 signaling
effects on human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC). Tumor tissues were obtained from 27 patients with
laryngeal and 12 with oral cavity cancers. Normal mucosa was
obtained from 10 patients with nonneoplastic disorders.
Smears for bacteria were taken from all patients during
surgery. TLR4 expression in tumors and HNSCC cell lines (PCI1, PCI-13, and PCI-30) was detected by reverse transcriptionPCR and immunohistochemistry. Cell growth, apoptosis,
nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) translocation, and MyD88 and
IRAK-4 expression, as well as Akt phosphorylation were
measured following tumor cell exposure to the TLR4 ligand
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Tumor cell sensitivity to NK-92–
mediated lysis was evaluated in 4-hour 51Cr-release assays.
Cytokine levels in HNSCC supernatants were measured in
Luminex-based assays. TLR4 was expressed in all tumors,
HNSCC cell lines, and normal mucosa. The TLR4 expression
intensity correlated with tumor grade. LPS binding to TLR4 on
tumor cells enhanced proliferation, activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, up-regulated IRAK-4 expression,
induced nuclear NF-KB translocation, and increased production (P < 0.05) of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial
growth factor, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. TLR4 triggering protected tumor cells from lysis
mediated by NK-92 cells. TLR4 ligation on tumor cells
supports HNSCC progression. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):3105–13]

immune and nonimmune cells of pathogen-associated molecular
patterns, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), viral double-stranded
RNA, and unmethylated CpG islands (5–7). TLR can also recognize
some host molecules, which are released during cellular stress or
cell death (8). TLR triggering induces a release of inflammatory
cytokines, activation of adaptive immunity, and maturation of
dendritic cells (9).
Due to the pivotal role of TLR in immune responses to
pathogens, most research aimed at understanding the TLR biology
has been focused on immune cells. In patients with cancer, who are
often immunosuppressed (10, 11), TLR-mediated activation of
innate or adaptive immunity could be of considerable benefit. It
has been known for a long time that microbial compounds can be
used as efficient adjuvants in antitumor vaccine formulations, and
numerous animal tumor models clearly indicate the potency of
different TLR agonists in enhancing antitumor immune responses
(12–14). However, TLR are also expressed on endothelial and
epithelial cells, including tumor cells (15–18). To date, little is
known about the function and biological importance of TLR
expressed on tumor cells. Preliminary evidence suggests that TLR
expressed on tumor cells may play an important role in the tumor
development. For example, ligation of TLR4 expressed on tumor
cells can induce chronic inflammation, which promotes tumor
growth (19). Triggering of TLR9 on prostate cancer cells has also
been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation (20). In contrast,
Wang and colleagues (21) showed that TLR9 stimulation on lung
cancer cells sensitized tumor cells to apoptosis, leading to the
arrest of tumor growth. Thus, controversial information exists
about the role of various TLR on tumor progression. In this study,
we test the hypothesis that signaling via the TLR4 expressed on
human tumor cells induces tumor growth and facilitates tumor
escape from immune surveillance.

Introduction
Toll-like receptors (TLR) expressed on immune cells play
a critical role in immune responses against invading pathogens
(1–4). TLR are members of the evolutionary conserved interleukin
(IL)-1R receptor family that are broadly represented on immune
cells, especially on antigen-presenting cells. At least 11 mammalian
TLR have been identified and are involved in the recognition by

Materials and Methods
Patients. Primary tumor samples of the larynx and oral cavity were
obtained from 39 patients with histopathologically confirmed head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who underwent surgery in the
University Otolaryngology Clinic in Poznan, Poland. Smears for culture of
microbes present in the tumor were taken from all patients during surgery.
As controls, mucosal tissue samples were obtained from 10 patients
undergoing surgery for nonneoplastic and noninflammatory disorder, the
sleep apnea syndrome. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at
the University of Medical Sciences in Poznan and all patients signed
informed consent forms. The clinicopathologic characteristics of the
HNSCC patients included in this study are presented in Table 1.
Cell lines. HNSCC cell lines (PCI-1, PCI-13, and PCI-30) were established
at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and maintained as

previously described (22). PCI-1 and PCI-30 cell lines originated from the
well-differentiated tumors of the larynx or oral cavity, respectively, and
PCI-13 from a poorly differentiated oral cavity carcinoma (23, 24). Cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, L-glutamine, and
antibiotics (all from Invitrogen). Cells used for our experiments were in the
log phase of growth and were negative for Mycoplasma and endotoxin, as
confirmed by PCR (Mycoplasma Tissue Culture Detection kit, Gen-Probe)
and Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (Cambrex), respectively.
Treatment of tumor cells with LPS and cisplatin. Cells were seeded in
wells of 6- or 24-well plates (5  105/mL). LPS and cisplatin (both
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) were added to tumor cells at the
concentrations of 0.1 to 10 Ag/mL and 10 Amol/L, respectively. As controls,
tumor cells were cultured in medium alone. In some experiments, tumor
cells silenced for TLR4 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) were stimulated
with LPS. Plates were incubated at 37jC for 6 to 48 h. Supernatants were
collected and stored frozen at 20jC for cytokine analyses.
Reverse transcription-PCR. To determine TLR expression at the mRNA
level, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed. Tumor cells (2 
106) were harvested, washed in PBS, cryopreserved, and stored in 80jC.
After cell thawing and washing, total RNA was isolated using the Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with random

primers using Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). The set of primers used to detect
TLR1 to TLR10 were previously described by Lauzon and colleagues (25) or
designed by us: TLR1, 5¶-CTTATAAGTGTGACTACCCGG-3¶ (forward) and
5¶-CCACAATGCTCTTGCCAGG-3¶ (reverse); TLR2, 5¶-GTTAACAATCCGGAGGCTGC-3¶ (forward) and 5¶-TTGGGAATGCAGCCTGTTAC-3¶ (reverse);
TLR3, 5¶-GTGCCAGAAACTTCCCATGT-3¶ (forward) and 5¶-CTTCCAATTGCGTGAAAACA-3¶ (reverse); TLR4, 5¶-CTGCAATGGATCAAGGACCA-3¶
(forward) and 5¶-TCCCACTCCAGGTAAGTGTT-3¶ (reverse); TLR5, 5¶-TGGGGGAACTTTACAGTTCG-3¶ (forward) and 5¶-CTGGGATTCTCTGAAGGGG-3¶
(reverse); TLR6, 5¶-GGGTTGAGAGTATAGTGGTG-3¶ (forward) and 5¶-GTAGATGCAGAGGGAGGTC-3¶ (reverse); TLR7, 5¶-CCTCAGCCACAACCAACTG-3¶
(forward) and 5¶-TTGTGTGCTCCTGGCCCC-3¶ (reverse); TLR8, 5¶-AAACTTGAGCCACAACAACATTT-3¶ (forward) and 5¶-ATCTCCAATGTCACAGGTGC-3¶ (reverse); TLR9, 5¶-AACTGGCTGTTCCTGAAGTC-3¶ (forward) and
5¶-TGCCGTCCATGAATAGGAAG-3¶ (reverse); and TLR10, 5¶-AAAACTCTAAATGCGGGAAGAAA-3¶ (forward) and 5¶-GAAATAAATGCGTGGAATCGGA-3¶
(reverse). The PCR was performed using an Expand High Fidelity PCR
System (Roche) under the following conditions: denaturation temperature
of 95jC for 45 s, annealing temperature of 60jC for 45 s, and extension
temperature of 72jC for 1 min.
Flow cytometry. TLR4 expression on PCI cells was evaluated by flow
cytometry as described (26) using the Alexa Fluor 488–labeled mouse antihuman TLR4 antibody, HTA-125 clone (eBioscience).
Immunostaining. The following primary antibodies were used for
immunostaining: polyclonal rabbit anti-human TLR4 (Abcam), polyclonal
goat anti-human TLR4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or appropriate isotype
control IgG. Donkey anti-goat FITC labeled was used as the secondary
antibody at 1:500 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Mouse anti-human
pancytokeratin antibody (Dako) was used to confirm the epithelial origin
of tumor cells. Antibodies were used at working concentrations of 2 to
5 Ag/mL. For immunofluorescence, tumor cells were seeded on glass slides,
air dried, washed in PBS, fixed in 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min,
permabilized with 0.1% Triton X, and blocked with 2% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in PBS for 45 min. Sections were incubated with the goat
primary antibody for TLR4 for 1 h at room temperature in a moist chamber
and then with a secondary antibody. In controls, primary antibody was
replaced by 0.5% BSA or isotype IgG. Sections were mounted in a medium
with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) to trace cell
nuclei. Paraffin sections of tumor tissues or normal mucosa were cut and
stained as previously described (18). After standard deparaffinization, the
EnVision+ System (Dako) was used for staining according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In short, after an overnight incubation with
the rabbit anti-TLR4 antibody, sections were first incubated with labeled
polymer-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) anti-rabbit antibody and then with
3,3¶-diaminobenzidine. To eliminate nonspecific binding of the secondary
antibody, tissue sections were incubated with a serum-free protein blocker
before adding the goat anti-TLR4 antibody. Sections were counterstained
with Meyer’s hematoxylin and mounted in glycerol jelly.
Slides were evaluated in a light microscope (400 magnification) or in
an inverted Olympus FluoView 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope
under an oil immersion objective (Center for Biologic Imaging Core
Facility, University of Pittsburgh). For digital image analysis, the software
Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 was used. Results were scored by two
independent investigators (M.J.S. and M.H.) as positive, heterogeneous, or
negative, when the percentage of stained tumor cells in each section was
>75%, between 25% and 75%, and <25%, respectively. The two scores were
averaged. The level of staining intensity was recorded as none, weak,
moderate, or strong.
Western blot analysis. Tumor cells were coincubated with LPS for the
indicated periods of time at 37jC, and Western blots were performed as
previously described (27). Briefly, cells were lysed in equal volumes of icecold lysis buffer and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce Chemical Co.). Cell
homogenates were boiled for 5 min in 5 Laemmli sample buffer and
proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free milk or 5% BSA in 0.05% Tween 20 in
TBS. After an overnight incubation at 4jC with monoclonal or polyclonal
rabbit anti–phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), anti-Akt, anti–IRAK-4, or

anti-MyD88 antibodies (all from Cell Signaling Technology), membranes
were incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:150,000
dilution (Pierce Chemical) for 1 h at room temperature and developed with
a SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce Chemical). To
inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, LY294002 (Cell
Signaling Technology) inhibitor was used at the concentration of
10 Amol/L (28).
Nuclear factor-KB assays. Aliquots of tumor cells (1  104) to be used
for confocal microscopy were seeded on glass slides placed in Petri dishes
overnight at 37jC in 5% of CO2 in air. LPS was added to the cells, and
after 12 h of incubation, cells were stained as described above using the
rabbit anti-p65 antibody. Translocation of a nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) p65
subunit to nuclei was observed. The percentages of positive cells were
determined by examining at least 200 tumor cells for each treatment
condition. To measure the p65 subunit binding activity, nuclear and
cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using a TransFactor extraction kit
(Clontech). DNA binding by p65 was detected by ELISA using a
TransFactor Profiling kit (Clontech; ref. 29). 1-Pyrrolidinecarbodithioic
acid (PDTC; Calbiochem) was used at the concentration of 15 Amol/L for
blocking of NF-nB activity (30).
Tumor cell proliferation. Tumor cells plated overnight in wells of sixwell plates at the density of 10  103 per well were incubated with a fresh
medium or medium supplemented with LPS at various working concentrations. The viability and numbers of tumor cells were determined by
microscope counts in the presence of a trypan blue dye using tumor cells
harvested after treatment with TripLE Select solution (Invitrogen) on days 3
and 5 of culture.
7-Amino-actinomycin-D assay. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow
cytometry as previously described (31). Tumor cells were treated with
cisplatin (10 Amol/L) for 24 h in the presence or absence of LPS (1 Ag/mL).
Then, the cells were harvested and washed in PBS, resuspended in

prediluted binding buffer, and stained with 7-amino-actinomycin-D (7-AAD;
Becton Dickinson) for 15 min on ice, protected from light. The cells were
washed and resuspended in 7-AAD–binding buffer, and apoptosis of tumor
cells was immediately evaluated by flow cytometry.
Luminex-based assay. Supernatants of tumor cells (plated at 5 
105/mL) were collected after 48 h of coincubation with TLR ligands. The
levels of IL-1h, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFN-g, tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth
factor-h1 (TGF-h1), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), eotaxin, MCP-1, MIP-1a,
RANTES, and IP-10 were measured using immunobead-based 16-plex assays
(Luminex). Panels of capture antibody-coated beads and labeled detection
antibodies were purchased from Biosource. The assay sensitivity varied
from 5 to 15 pg/mL, depending on the analyte. The assays were performed
using the Bio-Plex System (Bio-Rad).
Natural killer cell cytotoxicity assays. The 4-h 51Cr-release assays were
performed using the PCI cells as targets and NK-92 cells as effectors (32).
Controls included targets incubated in medium alone (spontaneous release)
and targets in 5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (maximum release). The
radioactivity was measured using Wallac Wizard 1470 Automatic Gamma
Counter. The percentages of cytotoxic activity and lytic units were
calculated using the Coggins program.
Silencing TLR4. Expression of TLR4 in the cell lines was temporarily
silenced by using siRNA (20, 33, 34). Briefly, 2  105 tumor cells were seeded
in wells of six-well plates and cultured in RPMI 1640. At confluence, cells
were collected and resuspended in the transfection medium containing the
transfection reagent and human TLR4 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
at different concentrations (4, 8, 10, or 12 AL). Negative control siRNA,
which had no homology to known sequences from humans (i.e.,
nontargeting 20- to 25-nucleotide siRNA), was used as control. Transfection
was performed as recommended by the siRNA manufacturer. To assess

efficiency of the transfection process, nontargeting siRNA labeled with FITC
was used in parallel to experimental cultures. Cultures with the transfection
efficiency of >90% as assessed by fluorescence microscopy were used for
further studies. Cells were incubated in the RPMI 1640 complete medium
for 6 h at 37jC in an atmosphere of CO2 in air and, after a medium change,
for additional 24 h in the medium supplemented with LPS. The viability of
tumor cells was tested by a trypan blue dye exclusion, and the expression of
targeted genes in tumor cells was tested on days 4, 8, and 12 by RT-PCR and
Western blots. Assessments of tumor cell proliferation, cytokine production,
and translocation of p65 subunit of NF-nB were also performed.
Statistical analysis. Data were summarized by descriptive statistics (the
mean and SD for continuous variables; the frequency and percentage for
categorical variables). The paired Student’s t test was used to evaluate
differences between treated versus untreated pairs of cell lines. Statistical
analyses of differences in more than two parameters were performed using
the ANOVA test. The P values of <0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Patients and controls. Table 1 summarizes clinicopathologic
characteristics of the patients and normal controls included in this
study. The group of normal controls comprised seven men and
three women (age range, 32–59 years) who underwent laryngological surgery for nonmalignant diseases. All 39 HNSCC patients
had advanced primary tumors (stages T3 and T4), and 21 had nodal
involvement. The patient group included 34 males and 5 females
(age range, 50–77 years). All had histopathologically confirmed
squamous cell carcinomas. Cultures of samples taken from the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

tumor at the time of surgery included Gram-negative (Citrobacter
diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus
mirabilis) and/or Gram-positive (Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus hemophilus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus,
and Actinobacteria) bacteria and/or fungi (Candida albicans).
TLRs are expressed by tumor cells. Using RT-PCR and
immunostaining, we showed that TLRs are expressed on tumor
cells (Fig. 1). All three tested tumor cell lines showed high levels of
TLR4 expression. The highest level of mRNA for TLR4 was detected
in the PCI-30 cell line (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence confirmed
TLR4 protein expression in all tumor cell lines (Fig. 1B). TLR4
was also detected in tumor tissues, as previously reported (17).
In tumor cells, TLR4 was localized in the cytoplasm and the
cell membrane, and its expression ranged from weak to strong
(Fig. 1C). TLR4 was also detected in 9 of 10 specimens of the
normal mucosa, although the cytoplasmic expression of TLR4 was
weak relative to that seen in the tumor. The epithelial origin of
tumor cells in tissue sections and normal mucosa was confirmed
by the staining for cytokeratin (Fig. 1C).
A strong positive reaction for TLR4 was characteristic for welldifferentiated or moderately well-differentiated tumors (G1 or G2)
relative to moderate or weak staining intensity in poorly
differentiated tumors (G3; Fig. 1C). These tissue staining results
correspond to expression of TLR4 on the HNSCC cell lines (i.e.,
PCI-30 cells), which originated from a well-differentiated tumor
and also showed the highest expression of TLR4. In the tumor
microenvironment, a moderate to large number of TLR4 +
inflammatory cells were observed (data not shown). We did not
find any correlation between expression of TLR4 on tumor cells
and the number of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes.
LPS promotes tumor cell proliferation. Effects of LPS on
tumor cell proliferation were studied in all three PCI cell lines,
which were either exposed to various concentrations of LPS (0.1–
10 Ag/mL) or pretreated with siRNA specific for TLR4 before LPS
addition. As shown in Fig. 2A, LPS significantly enhanced tumor
cell proliferation of (P < 0.05). The proliferation was decreased
(P < 0.05) in the presence of siRNA specific for TLR4 followed by
stimulation with LPS (Fig. 2B).
LPS protects tumor cells from drug-induced apoptosis. In
the control cultures, spontaneous apoptosis ranged from 3.8% to
7.6%. After stimulation with LPS alone, apoptosis levels remained
low (3–8%). Cisplatin induced apoptosis in PCI-1, PCI-13, and PCI30 cells (mean F SD = 36 F 4%, 44 F 3%, and 33 F 4%,
respectively) after 24-hour incubation. The 6-hour preincubation of
tumor cells with LPS decreased the sensitivity to cisplatin-induced
apoptosis to 36% in PCI-13 cells (Fig. 3A). For all three tumor cell
lines, this decrease was 28 F 5%, 36 F 3%, and 22 F 4.5% in PCI-1,
PCI-13, and PCI-30, respectively (P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S1).
As shown in Fig. 3B, PCI-13 cells treated with cisplatin showed an
altered morphology, with many cells undergoing apoptosis.
However, the effect of the drug was partially abrogated when
tumor cells were preincubated with LPS (0.1–10 Ag/mL). These
data suggested that LPS protected TLR4+ tumor cells from
apoptosis.
TLR4 signaling in tumor cells engages MyD88, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and IRAK pathways. To evaluate molecular
pathways engaged in the induction of tumor cell resistance or
sensitivity to apoptosis on stimulation with LPS, components of
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival pathway were
examined. MyD88, IRAK-4, and pAkt were constitutively expressed
in all three PCI cell lines. The highest level of baseline pAkt was

observed in PCI-30 (Fig. 3C) and PCI-1 (data not shown). After
stimulation with LPS for 5 to 15 minutes, the level of pAkt
increased, as did levels of MyD88 and IRAK-4 (Fig. 3C). When the
PCI-30 cell line was incubated with LY294002, phosphorylation of
Akt was blocked (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and this corresponded
to the partial abrogation of the protective effects of LPS from
cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2C). The data
suggest that LPS-mediated protection of TLR4+ tumor cells from
drug-induced apoptosis is mediated through the phosphorylation
of Akt.
LPS induces activation of NF-KB. Next, translocation of a
p65 subunit of NF-nB to cell nuclei and binding activity of p65
to DNA were evaluated after stimulation of tumor cells with LPS
(Fig. 3D). The baseline translocation level of p65 subunit was
detected in each PCI cell line, and the translocation occurred in
the similar proportion of cells: 28 F 10%, 22 F 8%, and 19 F
12% (mean F SD) for PCI-1, PCI-13, and PCI-30 cells,
respectively. We observed significant increases in the percent
of cells, showing the p65 subunit translocation after treatment
with LPS: 78 F 14%, 72 F 15%, and 90 F 9% for PCI-1, PCI-13,
and PCI-30 cells, respectively (P < 0.05). The highest frequency of

positive cells and the highest intensity of fluorescence were
observed in PCI-30 cell line (90 F 9% of positive cells in
Fig. 4C). When the PCI-30 cell line was incubated with
PDTC, an inhibitor of p65 binding to DNA (30), LPS-induced
NF-nB activation was completely inhibited (Supplementary
Fig. S2B), and LPS-mediated protection from cisplatin-induced
apoptosis was significantly abrogated (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
These results further indicate that LPS-mediated protection of
TLR4+ tumor cells from apoptosis induced by cisplatin is
mediated via the NF-nB pathway and binding of the p65
subunit to DNA.
siRNA-mediated inhibition of TLR4 expression in tumor cell
lines. The expression of TLR4 was temporarily silenced using
TLR4-specific siRNA. The transfection frequency was determined in
a fluorescence microscope, where at least 90% of siRNA-FITC cells
were positive (Supplementary Fig. S3). The transfected cells were
assessed for the successful silencing of TLR4. Using Western blots
(Fig. 4A), the optimal concentration of TLR4 siRNA (8–10 AL) was
determined in titration experiments until TLR4 was successfully
silenced for at least 8 days. Concentrations of siRNAs higher than
15 AL were found to be toxic to the cells. All tumor cell lines

(Supplementary Fig. S1) were also evaluated and consistently

LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines by
tumor cells. The supernatants of each cell line were analyzed for
levels of inflammatory cytokines as well as growth factors after
48 hours of culture. Depending on the tumor cell line, supernatants
were positive for MCP-1, RANTES, IP-10, TNF-a (data not shown),
GM-CSF (detected only in supernatants from PCI-30), IL-6, IL-8,
and VEGF (Fig. 5A). The levels of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, and GM-CSF
dramatically increased after stimulation with LPS (10 Ag/mL) in
supernatants of PCI-30, correlating with the highest expression of
TLR4 and NF-nB translocation in this cell line (P < 0.05). For the
other cell lines, IL-6 and IL-8 production was variable. Supernatants of all tested tumor cell lines were negative for eotaxin, MIP1a, MIP-1h, IL-1h, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-g, TGF-h1, or FGF.
The cytokine production was decreased (P < 0.05) in the presence

of siRNA specific for TLR4 followed by stimulation with LPS as
shown in Fig. 5A.
LPS decreased sensitivity of tumor cells to immune lysis.
Unstimulated tumor cells were sensitive to NK-92 cell-mediated
lysis as shown in 51Cr-release assays (Fig. 5B). When tumor cells
were coincubated for 12 hours with LPS, however, they became
resistant to immune lysis, showing significantly decreased lytic
units of activity relative to nonstimulated cells. The strongest
protective effect of LPS was observed on PCI-30 cells and the
weakest on PCI-13 cells.

Discussion
Current evidence indicates that TLR play a pivotal role in the
activation of innate immunity against invading pathogens, cytokine
production, and development of adaptive immune responses (9). In
contrast to the protective role of TLR against pathogen infections,
this study suggests that TLR expressed on tumor cells contribute to
tumor progression. Consistent with our previous studies (17), we
now confirm that HNSCC cells in situ and in culture express nearly
all TLR. Using TLR4 as an example, we also show that tumors use
TLR for their own benefit. Because the endogenous ligands for
TLR4 in tumors are not known, we have used LPS and cisplatin to

TLR4 Expressed in HNSCC Promotes Tumor Development

examine the effects of TLR4 activation and signaling on tumor cell
growth. In addition, to prove that exogenous ligands similar to LPS
exist in the tumor microenvironment and potentially can signal
via TLR4, we obtained and examined tumor specimens for the
presence of microbes. We found that bacteria and fungi were
invariably present in HNSCC tumors. Therefore, triggering of TLR4
expressed on tumor cells by bacteria-derived products, including
LPS, could be involved in promoting tumor growth and in
protection of tumors from immune interference in vivo.
Most studies of TLR4 signaling are focused on immune cells and
suggest that enhancement of TLR functions promotes dendritic cell
maturation and thus is beneficial for the tumor-bearing host.
Specifically, TLR4 expression on inflammatory cells has been
reported to inhibit tumor growth (12). In contrast, TLR4 expressed
on tumor cells has been shown to promote colon cancer
progression through immune evasion mediated by tumor-induced
inhibition of natural killer (NK) cell and effector T-cell activity (35).
Ligation of TLR4 expressed on tumor cells can also induce chronic
inflammation in the tumor microenvironment known to be a
tumor-promoting factor (19). In our hands, triggering of TLR4 by
its ligand, LPS, induced tumor promotion by the induction of
proliferation, activation of NF-nB, p65 binding to DNA, and
resistance to NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity accompanied by the

increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8),
VEGF, and GM-CSF. These factors have been reported to promote
not only tumor progression but also the development of myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSC; refs. 36–41). In turn, MDSC may
induce chronic inflammation and induce immune suppression
through activation of regulatory T cells (42). In aggregate, it seems
that activation of TLR acts as a double-edged sword, enhancing
host immunity against tumor on the one hand and, on the other,
promoting tumor progression.
The effects of LPS on tumor cell survival and tumor cell
proliferation have been previously reported, although inconsistent
results were obtained, depending on the tumor type (43–45). Our
observations in HNSCC showed that LPS promotes tumor cell
proliferation and induces tumor cell resistance to drug-mediated
apoptosis or to NK-92 cell-mediated lysis. This resistance
correlated with the NF-nB p65 subunit translocation to nucleus,
MyD88 activation, and the up-regulation of IRAK-4 expression in
tumor cells. Because activated NF-nB has antiapoptotic properties,
high levels of its expression in tumor cells are associated with
tumor progression and induction of chronic inflammation in the
tumor microenvironment (46).
When the expression levels of TLR4 in situ were correlated with
tumor differentiation, it seemed that poorly differentiated tumors

density of 5  105/mL after 48 h of stimulation and tested for levels of various cytokines in the presence or absence of siRNA and LPS as described in Materials
and Methods. B, results of 51Cr-release assays with tumor cell targets stimulated with LPS (10 Ag/mL). NK-92 cells are effector cells. The data are representative from

expressed little TLR4. In contrast, TLR4 was highly expressed in
well-differentiated and moderately well-differentiated tumors and
in the PCI-30 cell line. Furthermore, TLR4 triggering in PCI-30 cells
showed strong protective and tumor growth–promoting effects. In
well-differentiated HNSCC, abundant expression of TLR4 on tumor
cells may have important biological and clinical implications.
These tumors usually contain bacteria and bacterial products, as
shown in our patient cohort (Table 1). Thus, in vivo activation of
the tumor-associated TLR4 by bacterial products in patients with
well-differentiated tumors would be likely to induce abundant
chronic inflammation, promote tumor growth, and protect tumor
cells from apoptosis. As sensitivity to chemotherapy is dependent
on tumor cell proliferation, we hypothesize that the TLR4
expression in vivo may also have considerable effect on the
patients’ response to oncologic therapies. Taken together, our
results showing that TLR4 is functionally active on HNSCC cells,
and that TLR4 signaling modifies tumor behavior and its
