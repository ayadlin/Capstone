Abstract
It is generally thought that the anticancer efﬁcacy of antibody–drug conjugates (ADC) relies on their
internalization by cancer cells. However, recent work on an ADC that targets ﬁbronectin in the tumor
microenvironment suggests this may not be necessary. The alternatively spliced extra domains A and B (EDA
and EDB) of ﬁbronectin offer appealing targets for ADC development, because the antigen is strongly expressed in
many solid human tumors and nearly undetectable in normal tissues except for the female reproductive system.
In this study, we describe the properties of a set of ADCs based on an antibody targeting the alternatively spliced
EDA of ﬁbronectin coupled to one of a set of potent cytotoxic drugs (DM1 or one of two duocarmycin derivatives).
The DM1 conjugate SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 mediated potent antitumor activity in mice bearing DM1-sensitive F9
tumors but not DM1-insensitive CT26 tumors. Quantitative biodistribution studies and microscopic analyses
conﬁrmed a preferential accumulation of SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 in the subendothelial extracellular matrix of tumors,
similar to the pattern observed for unmodiﬁed antibody. Notably, we found that treatments were well tolerated at
efﬁcacious doses that were fully curative and compatible with pharmaceutical development. Our ﬁndings offer a
preclinical proof-of-concept for curative ADC targeting the tumor microenvironment that do not rely upon
antigen internalization. Cancer Res; 74(9); 2569–78. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Antibody–drug conjugates (ADC) represent an attractive
class of biopharmaceuticals, which has gained considerable
attention for the development of anticancer products (1, 2),
especially after the approval of drugs such as Adcetris and
Kadcyla (3, 4).
It is generally believed that antibodies capable of selective
internalization into the tumor cells are needed for efﬁcient
ADC development because cytotoxic drugs typically act at the
level of intracellular targets. Indeed, it has been claimed that
targeting an ADC to a noninternalizing target antigen with the
expectation that extracellulary released drug will diffuse into
the target cell is not a recipe for a successful ADC (5).
We have recently challenged the concept of a strict requirement for internalization in ADC development. In particular, we

have shown that noninternalizing antibodies speciﬁc to splice
isoforms of ﬁbronectin, coupled to derivatives of cemadotin (a
tubulin poison with in vitro cytotoxic activity in the 1–20 nmol/L
range) are able to mediate a statistically signiﬁcant tumor growth
retardation (albeit at doses as high as 43 mg/kg) in three different
murine models of cancer (F9, CT26, and A20; refs. 6, 7). The F8
and the L19 antibodies recognize the alternatively spliced extra
domains A and B of ﬁbronectin, respectively, which are markers
of tumor angiogenesis (8–10). The ﬁbronectin ﬁbers recognized
by the two antibodies are located in the subendothelial extracellular matrix of tumor blood vessels (11). Immunoﬂuorescence
and microautoradiographic analysis, following intravenous
administration of the L19 and F8 antibodies to tumor-bearing
mice, conﬁrmed that the antibodies efﬁciently and preferentially
localized to tumor blood vessels in vivo. Quantitative biodistribution studies of antibody uptake are available in tumor-bearing
mice (9, 12, 13) and in patients with cancer (14, 15).
With the hope to achieve more potent therapeutic effects, we
decided to substitute cemadotin with the maytansinoid derivative DM1 and duocarmycins, highly cytotoxic drugs, which
have extensively been used for ADC development with internalizing antibodies.
DM1 is the potent cytotoxic component in trastuzumabDM1 (Kadcyla), an ADC approved for the treatment of Her2positive breast cancer (4). DM1 is a maytansinoid derivative,
ﬁrst described in 1992 (16). Maytansinoids are natural products
that have been used and investigated in clinical trials (17). They
have a macrolide structure based on a 19-membered ring and
act by preventing the microtubule polymerization through
binding to the same site on the b subunit of tubulin as Vinca

alkaloids (18). The inhibition of polymerization causes cellcycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis of the target cell. DM1
has an in vitro cytotoxicity that is 3- to 10-fold greater than
maytansine and 10- to 200-fold greater than vincristine, a Vinca
alkaloid (19, 20).
The other drugs used in this work are derivatives of duocarmycins, antibiotic metabolites isolated from Streptomyces
bacteria in 1988 (21). Duocarmycins are potent cytotoxic
agents with IC50 values in the pmol/L range against different
cell lines (22). Despite this high potency, duocarmycins themselves are not applicable for cancer chemotherapy because
they cause pronounced myelotoxicity, preventing escalation to
therapeutically active regimen. The mechanism of action of
duocarmycins involves binding to the minor groove of DNA
and alkylation of adenines at the N3 position. Their molecular
structure shows an indole moiety as DNA-binding component
and a spirocyclopropylcyclohexadienone moiety as pharmacophore group that causes sequence-selective DNA alkylation
(23). A recent controversial theory claims that duocarmycins
act also by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, an enzyme
target that plays important roles in the viability and detoxiﬁcation of cancer cells (24–26). For ADCs applications, we have
used duocarmycin analogues that had previously been shown
to be more potent and more synthetically accessible than their
naturally occurring counterpart (27).
We chose to use antibodies in the small immunoprotein
(SIP) format, as we have previously shown that this format
combines an excellent uptake at the tumor site with a rapid
clearance from blood and normal tissues (9, 28–30).
The SIP format allows the production of ADCs with
traceless linkers, i.e., products which regenerate the intact
antibody and the intact drug after a suitable cleavage
reaction, such as the reduction of a disulﬁde bond (6) or
a hydrolytic process (31). Indeed, the reduction of disulﬁde
bonds connecting antibody and drug is a particularly attractive release mechanism, as it can be triggered by cell death
and be further ampliﬁed by the release of thiols (e.g., cysteine
and glutathione) from dying cells (6).
In this article, we show that SIP(F8), but not the anti-hen egg
lysozyme SIP(KSF) antibody used as negative control, is able
to preferentially localize on solid tumors at doses of 7 mg/kg,
both in the unmodiﬁed form and in the ADC form. The conjugate
of F8 with DM1 mediated a potent antitumor activity, including
several cures, in immunocompetent mice bearing subcutaneously grafted F9 murine teratocarcinomas, but not in mice
bearing CT26 tumors. In contrast, only a modest in vivo anticancer effect was observed for two F8 derivatives with duocarmycins, despite the fact that the drug was very cytotoxic in vitro.
The ﬁndings of this article are of potential clinical relevance
because the F8 antibody strongly stains the majority of human
tumors (9, 32). In contrast, placenta, endometrium, and some
vessels in the ovaries were the only structures to be stained by
F8 in the triplicate immunoﬂuorescence analysis of a panel of
36 normal adult tissues (33). Noninternalizing ADCs have the
ability to induce a potent anticancer activity in vivo when used
with a suitable payload and may target a broad variety of
different malignancies, including lymphomas (34–36) and,
potentially, certain leukemias (37).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture: cell lines, incubation, and manipulation
conditions
Transfected CHO-S cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in suspension in PowerCHO-2CD medium (Lonza) as described
before (6). The F9 murine teratocarcinoma cells (American
Type Culture Collection, ATCC; CRL-1720) were grown on 0.1%
gelatin-coated tissue ﬂasks in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (Gibco), supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The CT26 murine colon
carcinoma cells (ATCC; CRL-2638) were cultured in RPMI-1640
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were obtained from
Invitrogen (CHO-S cells) or ATCC (F9 and CT26 cells) and were
kept in culture for less than 6 months after resuscitation. Cell
lines undergo comprehensive quality control and authentication procedures by the cell bank before shipment. These
include check of post-freeze viability, growth properties and
morphology, test for mycoplasma contamination, isoenzyme
assay, and sterility test.
Cytotoxic drugs
The thiol-containing maytansinoid DM1 was obtained from
Concortis Biosystems, Corp. The thiomethyl analog S-methyl
DM1 was prepared as described before (38). The derivatives of
duocarmycins were prepared as described in the Supplementary Data.
Animals and tumor models
Eleven- to 12-week-old female 129SvEv mice and Balb/c
nude mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories.
F9 teratocarcinoma cells (2.5  107) or CT26 colon carcinoma cells (5  107) were implanted subcutaneously in the
ﬂank. Animals were sacriﬁced when tumor volumes reached
a maximum of 2,000 mm3 or weight loss exceeded 15%.
Experiments were performed under project licenses granted
by the Veterin€aramt des Kantons Z€
urich (Z€
urich, Switzerland; 42/2012).
Cloning, expression, and protein in vitro
characterization
The gene structure for the F8 antibody in SIP format, the
isolation of the KSF antibody, speciﬁc to hen egg lysozyme, and
the cloning, expression, and characterization of the two antibodies have previously been described (6, 9).
Antibody–duocarmycin conjugates preparation
Protein solutions were thawed and ﬁltered with a 0.22 mm2
ﬁlter (Whatman Fp30/02 CA-S) and the concentration (0.4–0.5
mg/mL) was determined by measuring the UV absorbance
at 280 nm [protein extinction coefﬁcient at 280 nm: 56,380/
(mol/Lcm), estimated using the ExPASy ProtParam tool].
Polypropylene round-bottom tubes (BD Falcon) ﬁlled with the
protein solution were placed inside a Schlenk ﬂask and
degassed by three alternating rounds of vacuum and argon
ﬂow. A solution of 0.1 mol/L tris(2-carboxy-ethyl)-phosphine
hydrochloride (TCEP HCl; ABCR) in degassed PBS pH 7.4 was
added to 30 molar equivalents over antibody monomer, mixed
on a magnetic stirrer for 5 minutes at room temperature and

Cancer Cures with Noninternalizing Antibody–Drug Conjugates

incubated at 4 C over night, under argon atmosphere. For the
puriﬁcation of the reduced antibodies, a HiPrep desalting
column (GE Healthcare) on a AKTA puriﬁer fast protein liquid
chromatography (FPLC) system was equilibrated with
degassed 50 mmol/L HEPES buffer, containing 5 mmol/L
glycine (Fluka), 3% glycerol (v/v; Sigma Aldrich), and 2
mmol/L EDTA (Acros), pH 6.2. The reduced protein solution
was injected onto the preequilibrated column and eluted.
Fractions of 1 mL of the eluting conjugate were collected
manually, with a typical recovery of 75%. The concentration
of pooled fractions of puriﬁed reduced antibodies was determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm. Twenty equivalents of duocarmycin derivatives [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO;
Fluka) stock solutions, c ¼ 0.01 mol/L] over antibody monomer
were used for the conjugation in a Schlenk ﬂask, degassed by
three alternating rounds of vacuum and argon ﬂow. First,
ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (Acros) was added to the
antibody solution under vigorous stirring, realizing a 5% ﬁnal
concentration. Subsequently, the DMSO solution of the drugs
was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 hours at
room temperature under argon atmosphere. The resulting
ADCs were puriﬁed from excess drug by FPLC with a HiPrep
desalting column, preequilibrated with degassed 50 mmol/L
HEPES buffer, pH 7.2 in the case of the carbamate derivative,
and pH 6 for the carbonate derivatives, containing 5 mmol/L
glycine, 50 mmol/L NaCl (Merck), and 3% glycerol. Fractions
containing the conjugates were pooled, snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at 80 C until further use.
Antibody–DM1 conjugates preparation
The conjugation of thiol-containing drugs to terminal
cysteines of antibodies has been described in detail elsewhere
(39). Brieﬂy, the antibody was reduced with 30 equivalents of
TCEP HCl (ABCR) in PBS, pH 7.4, and then modiﬁed with 2,500
equivalents over antibody monomer of the Ellman reagent
(Sigma-Aldrich). In contrast with previous descriptions, DM1
conjugation required a different buffer system due to relatively
poor solubility of the drug. Speciﬁcally, the antibody–Ellman
conjugate was puriﬁed in PBS pH 7.4, containing 5% sucrose (w/v;
AppliChem) and 10% N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA; Acros
Organics). Ten equivalents of thiol drug DM1 over antibody
monomer were then weighed into a plastic vial and dissolved
in DMA immediately before addition to the puriﬁed antibody–
Ellman conjugate. The reaction was stopped after 5 minutes with
the addition of 500 equivalents (relative to the antibody monomer) of iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). The ﬁnal ADC was
puriﬁed by FPLC, using the PBS/sucrose/DMA buffer. ADCs
were then concentrated to the desired concentration, snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C until further use.

ADC Characterization
All ADCs were analyzed by SDS–PAGE (Invitrogen), sizeexclusion chromatography (Superdex200 10/300GL; GE Healthcare), and protein mass spectrometry. The EDA-binding properties of SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 were analyzed by surface plasmon
resonance (BIAcore 3000 System; GE Healthcare; Supplementary Fig. S4) on an EDA-coated CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) as
previously described (6).

www.aacrjournals.org

Biodistribution studies
The in vivo targeting performance of the antibody–DM1
conjugates was assessed by quantitative biodistribution studies as described before (40). SIP(F8) and the control SIP(KSF)
antibody, both in unmodiﬁed and ADC form, were radioiodinated with 125I (PerkinElmer) and injected into the lateral tail
vein of immunocompetent 129SvEv mice, bearing subcutaneously grafted F9 tumors (5 mice/group), at the dose of 7 mg/kg
(i.e., 177 nmol of ADC/kg of body weight of animal, corresponding to 130 mg of drug/kg of body weight of animal,
2.6 mg/injection/mouse). Mice were sacriﬁced 24 hours
after injection, organs were excised, weighed, and radioactivity was measured using a Packard Cobra g counter. Radioactivity of organs was expressed as percentage of injected dose
per gram of tissue (%ID/g  SEM).
Immunoreactivity of the labeled proteins were conﬁrmed by
analyzing the retention of radioiodinated proteins on EDA
coupled to CNBr-activated sepharose (GE Healthcare) as previously described (data not shown; ref. 40).
Immunoﬂuorescence studies of treated tumors
For ex vivo detection of the localization of SIP(F8)-SSDM1, a microscopic analysis was performed. Immunocompetent 129SvEv mice, bearing subcutaneously grafted F9
tumors, were treated with a single injection of 7 mg/kg of
the F8 conjugate or of the control KSF conjugate (dose in
analogy to the therapy experiment) and sacriﬁced 24 hours
after the injection. Tumors were excised, embedded in
cryoembedding medium (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and cryostat
sections (10 mm) were stained using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-human IgE (Dako Cytomation), to detect the
antibodies, and rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Biosciences) to
detect endothelial cells. Anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 488
(Molecular Probes by Life Technologies) and anti-rat IgGAlexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes by Life Technologies)
were used as secondary reagents for microscopic detection.
Therapy studies
When tumors were clearly palpable, 5 to 6 days after
subcutaneous tumor implantation, and the tumors typically
exhibited a size of 80 to 120 mm3, mice were randomly
grouped (n ¼ 5) and injected intravenously into the lateral
tail vein.
In the study with duocarmycin conjugates and in the ﬁrst
study with DM1 conjugates, mice were injected daily for a
period of 7 days, with ADCs, the corresponding free drug or
the vehicle. The daily dose of antibody–duocarmycins conjugates was 2.9 mg/kg (i.e., 74 nmol of ADC/kg of body weight of
animal, corresponding to 34 mg of drug/kg of body weight of
animal, 0.7 mg/injection/mouse) for the carbamate derivative
and 1.9 mg/kg (i.e., 48 nmol of ADC/kg of body weight of
animal, corresponding to 22 mg of drug/kg of body weight of
animal, 0.44 mg/injection/mouse) in the case of the carbonate
derivative, whereas 7 mg/kg was the daily injected dose for
DM1 conjugates. Equimolar amounts of the untargeted drugs
were also injected.
In the second DM1 conjugate therapy study, mice were
injected only three times, in intervals of 72 hours.

Therapy studies in tumor-bearing mice
The therapeutic activity of ADCs based on duocarmycins,
containing a disulﬁde bond and either a carbonate or a
carbamate in the linker (Fig. 1A), was tested in immunocompetent 129SvEv mice bearing subcutaneous F9 tumors.
Antibody–duocarmycin conjugates exhibited a lower toxicity compared with the free drug in vivo. In contrast with
the carbamate based ADC, which did not substantially delay
tumor growth, statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.0001, on day
12) tumor growth inhibition was observed for SIP(F8)-SS–
duocarmycin with a carbonate linker compared with the
saline treatment (Fig. 3). It is worth noting that internalizing ADCs based on similar duocarmycin derivatives have
been previously shown promising efﬁcacy in tumor-bearing
mice (41).
A completely different performance was observed when SIP
(F8)-SS-DM1 was tested in the F9 tumor model. In an initial
study, both F8 and KSF ADCs mediated complete and longlasting tumor eradication, with 7 daily doses at 7 mg/kg,
starting when tumors had reached 100 mm3 of volume. No
therapeutic activity was observed for the free drug used at
equimolar doses (Fig. 4). To see whether a difference in
therapeutic activity could be observed between SIP(F8)-SSDM1 and SIP(KSF)-SS-DM1, the therapy experiment was
repeated with only three injections at 7 mg/kg. In this case,
SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 continued to exhibit a strong therapeutic
activity, whereas all tumors progressed when the KSF counterpart was used (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S2). In the case

ADC preparation and characterization
Figure 1 illustrates the chemical strategies followed for the
preparation of ADCs based on DM1 or duocarmycins and on
the F8 and KSF antibodies in SIP format.
In both of the cases, disulﬁde-linked ADCs were produced
using a site-speciﬁc conjugation strategy (6) based on the
direct modiﬁcation of the C-terminal cysteines present in the
antibodies, with potent thiol-containing duocarmycin or DM1
drugs, following a mild reduction of the antibody's C-terminal
disulﬁde with TCEP. In the case of duocarmycin conjugates
(Fig. 1A), pyridyldithio drug derivatives were directly reacted
with thiol-containing reduced SIP, whereas in the case of DM1
conjugates (Fig. 1B) the C-terminal cysteine was ﬁrst modiﬁed
with the Ellman reagent. The subsequent addition of thiolcontaining DM1 yielded a homogeneous mixed disulﬁde–
linked ADC. Conjugation reactions proceeded with high conversion (>95%). Figure 2 presents a complete in vitro characterization by gel-electrophoresis, size-exclusion chromatography, and ESI-MS (electrospray-mass spectrometry) of all

tumor-free for >180 days), whereas tumors in the remaining
2 mice started to regrow after day 20.
A worse therapeutic effect was observed in immunocompetent Balb/c mice bearing CT26 murine tumors. Although
SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 continued to exhibit superiority compared
with saline (P ¼ 0.0149, on day 13) and free drug (P ¼ 0.0020,

accumulation of F8 and F8-DM1 at the tumor site, which was
not observed for the negative control KSF antibody and the
corresponding KSF–DM1 conjugate.
The results conﬁrmed that the targeting properties of the
F8 antibody were preserved at a dose of 7 mg/kg (the same
dose of the therapy experiment) and that the conjugation
to DM1 did not interfere with tumor targeting.
An ex vivo immunoﬂuorescence analysis (Fig. 5B) of
tumor sections following intravenous administration of the
ADCs products, conﬁrmed the selective accumulation of SIP
(F8)-SS-DM1 in the subendothelial extracellular matrix,
whereas no selective accumulation was observed for the
KSF counterpart.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of the induction of
lasting complete remissions in a murine immunocompetent
model of cancer, using noninternalizing ADCs.

The demonstration that cancer cures can be obtained
without antibody internalization, by the targeted delivery of
a suitable disulﬁde-linked ADC to the subendothelial extracellular matrix in solid tumors, suggests that a high local
concentration of a potent cytotoxic agent close to the tumor
neovasculature can mediate an extensive damage to the
whole neoplastic mass. Noninternalizing ADCs rely on labile
linkers for drug release in close proximity to the target
because the intact ADC cannot passively diffuse into cells.
Our ADCs are based on linkerless antibody modiﬁcation
with a potent thiol-containing drug, DM1-SH, which affords
homogeneous products by formation of a mixed disulﬁde.
Following extravasation, ADCs which have bound to the
subendothelial extracellular matrix release the cytotoxic
payload and initiate tumor cell death. Dying cells release
high concentrations of reducing agents (e.g., cysteine, glutathione) from their intracellular compartments into the
surrounding environment, thus, triggering additional release
of drug in a self-amplifying fashion.
The striking difference between the potent in vitro activity of
duocarmycin and the relative lack of activity of the corresponding ADCs in vivo suggests that an insufﬁcient stability of the
conjugates (Supplementary Fig. S1) and their pro-drug characteristics (a cyclopropyl ring needs to be formed, to display
DNA alkylating activity; 23) may cancel the beneﬁt of antibodybased pharmacodelivery.

Disulﬁde-bound DM1 was found to be a suitable payload for
ADC development. The ﬁnding that ADCs of irrelevant speciﬁcity in the mouse (e.g., SIP(KSF)-SS-DM1) may have a potent
antitumor activity (at higher doses compared with the tumorhoming F8-based ADC) is not uncommon in this area of
research and may reﬂect a therapeutic beneﬁt, associated with
a slow drug release.
In principle, the antibody-based delivery of potent cytotoxic
agents to the modiﬁed subendothelial extracellular matrix in
tumors should offer a number of advantages, compared with
the use of internalizing ADCs. Splice isoforms of ﬁbronectins
and tenascins are overexpressed in the majority of malignancies, whereas being undetectable in most normal adult tissues,
thus, providing the opportunity to treat different cancer types
with the same product. ECM antigens tend to be more stable
and more abundant compared with cellular antigens. The
release of cytotoxic payload in the extracellular environment
may facilitate a by-stander effect, as the drug can diffuse and
internalize in neighboring cells.
The F8 antibody cross-reacts between mouse and man,
thus, allowing the study of ADC products in syngeneic
immunocompetent mouse models of cancer. The intact
F8 antibody, in SIP or immunoglobulin G format, does not
display any antitumor activity (6, 7) at the doses used (A.
Villa, S. Wulhfard, and D. Neri, data not shown). Potentially,
SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 could activate an anticancer immunity, a

topic which is at present under intense experimental investigation by our laboratory.
Precise knowledge of ADC localization in the tumor (by
microscopic analysis; Fig. 5B) and a quantitative understanding of the amount of product that reaches the tumor mass (by
biodistribution analysis; Fig. 5A) should provide a rational
basis for the comparison of therapeutic efﬁcacy in different
models of cancer. Accurate dosimetric studies of tumor-targeting performance in patients, which are possible thanks to
advances in antibody radiolabeling procedures (30) and to the
implementation of immuno-PET procedures (15, 42), should
allow a direct comparison of clinical data with biodistribution
results in mice, facilitating product development and translational research.
In mice, the noninternalizing ADC SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 exhibited a biodistribution proﬁle that was similar to the one of the
unmodiﬁed antibody (Fig. 5A), even when this was used at
50-fold lower doses (9). This observation indicates that the
target antigen was not saturated in vivo at doses of 7 mg/kg,
which are routinely used for ADC therapy applications but
are higher than the ones typically used in antibody biodistribution studies.
A potent antitumor activity was observed with SIP(F8)-SSDM1 in 129SvEv mice bearing F9 teratocarcinoma, but not in

Balb/c mice bearing subcutaneously grafted CT26 colorectal
tumors. In in vitro cytotoxicity assays, the F9 cell line was found
to be at least 100-fold more sensitive to the action of the free
thiol DM1 and of its alkylated analog than CT26 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). These data suggest that the tumor cells,
rather than the endothelial cells, may be the primary target for
ADC activity, despite of the selective accumulation of SIP(F8)SS-DM1 around tumor blood vessels.
In certain experimental systems, it has been observed that
a selective damage to the tumor endothelium may cause an
indirect avalanche of tumor cell deaths (43–45). Other
derivatives of the F8 antibody (e.g., fusion proteins with
cytokines) have been found to be active both against F9 and
CT26 tumors (40, 46), suggesting that the different performance of F8-based ADCs may be related to the different
biologic activity of the DM1 payload toward the two cell
lines. In the future, it will be interesting to see whether this
correlation between in vitro sensitivity of tumor cells and in
vivo performance extends to other syngeneic models of
cancer.
The ﬁndings of this article are of potential clinical signiﬁcance because various armed antibodies speciﬁc to splice
isoforms of ﬁbronectin are currently being studied in clinical
trials (37, 47–49). The DM1 payload is one of the most widely

particularly attractive payload because it is detoxiﬁed in the
liver, helping spare clearance-related organs (50).
