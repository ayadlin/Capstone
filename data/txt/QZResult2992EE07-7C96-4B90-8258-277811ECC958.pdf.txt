ABSTRACT
MCL-1 (BCL-2 family anti-apoptotic protein) is responsible for melanoma’s
resistance to therapy. Cancer initiating cells also contribute to resistance and relapse
from treatments. Here we examined the effects of the MCL-1 inhibitor SC-2001 in
killing non melanoma-initiating-cells (bulk of melanoma), and melanoma-initiatingcells (MICs). By itself, SC-2001 significantly kills melanoma cells under monolayer
conditions in vitro and in a conventional mouse xenograft model. However, even
at high doses (10μM), SC-2001 does not effectively eliminate MICs. In contrast,
the combination of SC-2001 with ABT-737 (a BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor)
significantly decreases ALDH+ cells, disrupts primary spheres, and inhibits the selfrenewability of MICs. These results were observed in multiple melanomas, including
short term cultures of relapsed tumors from current treatments, independent of the
mutation status of BRAF or NRAS. Using a low-cell-number mouse xenograft model,
we examined the effects of these treatments on the tumor initiating ability of MICenriched cultures. The combination therapy reduces tumor formation significantly
compared to either drug alone. Mechanistic studies using shRNA and the CRISPR-Cas9
technology demonstrated that the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins NOXA and
BIM contribute to the combination-induced cell death. These results indicate that the
MCL-1 inhibitor SC-2001 combined with ABT-737 is a promising treatment strategy
for targeting melanoma.

the mutations targeted by these new drugs or those who
relapse from these treatments.
MCL-1 (Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) is an
anti-apoptotic protein of the BCL-2 family [3, 4]. The
MCL-1 locus is one of the “top ten” most amplified
genomic regions in a variety of human cancers [5],
correlating with an upregulation of MCL-1 activity [6–10].
This increase in MCL-1 expression is often associated with
chemotherapeutic resistance and relapse from therapeutics
[3]. Pharmacological inhibition or the molecular down

INTRODUCTION
For the first time several molecular-targeted and
immunotherapy drugs are significantly improving the
overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma.
However, despite these new therapeutics, many patients
still do not improve or eventually relapse after the initial
positive response [1, 2]. Thus, there is still a pressing need
for continued research especially for the patients without

regulation of MCL-1 via RNA-interference has shown
to promote apoptosis and/or overcome drug resistance in
multiple cancers [11–16]. Therefore, MCL-1 is a highpriority therapeutic target for cancer treatment [4, 6, 17].
Oncogenic activation of BRAF signaling in melanoma
upregulates MCL-1 expression and contributes to
increased resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors and overall
tumor progression and survival [18]. We and others have
shown that the knockdown of MCL-1 sensitizes melanoma
cells to various treatments, including BRAF or MEK
inhibitors [19–23] and thus, targeting MCL-1 can be a new
alternative for melanoma treatment.
Cancer Initiating Cells (CICs) are a subpopulation
of cancer cells which have enhanced tumor initiation,
progression, and chemo-resistance [24–26]. Recently,
multiple groups provided evidence of Melanoma
Initiating Cells (MICs), and suggest that MICs can
contribute to resistance to treatment [27–30]. Ideal cancer
treatment strategies stress on eliminating the resistant
subpopulations, such as CICs as well as the bulk of the
tumors (non-CICs) cells to prevent relapse [29, 31].
In this study we tested the efficacy of an MCL-1
inhibitor, SC-2001, either alone or in combination with ABT737 in killing melanoma cells and MICs. SC-2001 is a novel
MCL-1 inhibitor, and it is structurally related to obatoclax, a
small molecule inhibitor for multiple anti-apoptotic BCL-2
family members, including MCL-1. SC-2001 has anti-tumor
activity for liver cancers and breast cancers [32–34]. ABT737 is a small molecule BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor
and has shown a promising result in cancer therapy either by
itself or in combination with other chemotherapeutics in preclinical stage [35, 36]. However, many labs including ours
have found that ABT-737 by itself is not very effective for
treating melanoma as a single agent [23, 37, 38]. The results
here suggest that the use of a combination of MCL-1 and
BCL-2 inhibitors to induce NOXA and BIM is a promising
treatment strategy for melanoma regardless of the mutation
status of BRAF or NRAS, and it may overcome melanoma’s
resistance to current treatments.

MCL-1 protein expression is higher in
melanomas compared with Melanocytes
MCL-1 expression is associated with chemothera­
peutic resistance and relapse in various cancers [3] and
its increased expression is correlated with melanoma
progression [39]. However, it has not been examined
whether this correlation remains consistent for the common
mutations associated with melanoma. Here, the melanomas
we tested include commonly used melanoma cell lines and
tumor samples from melanoma patients. All tumor samples
were maintained in either short term cultures in vitro or
exclusively in a patient-derived xenograft model (PDX)
(Figure 1). The melanomas used here include BRAF-mutant
cells (HT144, 451Lu and MB2309), NRAS-mutated cells
(WM852c, SKMEL-30, Hs852T), NF-null cells (Hs852T),
or wild-type cells for the common mutations in BRAF,
NRAS, or NF1 (MB2141). The last category has been
referred to as triple-WT [40]. Most of the patient tumor
samples used here have relapsed from the moleculartargeted treatment (MB2309) or treatments of multiple
chemotherapies and radiation (MB2141). Figure 1 shows
higher MCL-1 protein expression in multiple melanoma
sphere cultures compared to normal human primary
melanocytes (PIG1, HEMNMP), regardless of mutation
status of these melanoma cultures. The increase in MCL-1
expression was between 4 to 21 fold. This finding provides
the rationale to treat a broader range of melanomas with
MCL-1 inhibitors to try to overcome resistance to current
treatments. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of the MCL-1
inhibitor, SC-2001.

SC-2001 is capable of eliminating the bulk
of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo
To investigate whether SC-2001 affects cell viability,
we used an ATP assay. SC-2001 significantly reduced
cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in multiple

cultures of melanoma samples relapsed from current treatments, with BRAF-mutated (HT144, 451Lu, and MB2309), NRAS-mutated
(SKMEL-30, WM852c and Hs852T), NF-null (Hs852T), or wild-type for common mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or NF1 (MB2141).

melanoma cultures and only a minimal reduction for
melanocytes (HEMNLP). At doses of 2.5uM or higher,
SC-2001 reduced cell viability for all melanoma cell lines
significantly compared to DMSO (P<0.01 or less). The
melanoma cells included BRAF or NRAS mutated cell
lines and tumor samples from melanoma patients that have
relapsed from current treatments (Figure 2A). The IC50s
for SC-2001 are 2.14μM to 4.62μM for the melanoma cell
lines (Supplementary Table S1). The drug also showed
increased cytotoxicity (at dose of 5 or 10 μM) in a dosedependent manner for all four melanoma cell lines tested
(P<0.001 or lesser) compared to DMSO, regardless of their
mutation status (Figure 2B). Higher doses of SC-2001 (5 or
10 μM) resulted in a more rounded morphology or complete
detachment from the plates (Figure 2C and Supplementary
Figure S1) that is consistent with the ATP and cytotoxicity
data suggesting that SC-2001 induced killing in these
melanoma populations. Additionally, cleavage of PARP
(Poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1) is a well-known marker
of cells undergoing apoptosis [41], and we performed
immunoblot assays of PARP to further assess the effects.
Figure 2D shows that the higher doses of SC-2001 (5 or
10 μM) induced an increased level of cleaved PARP in all

the melanoma cell lines tested. Additionally, an Annexin
V assay demonstrated that SC-2001 (2.5 or 5 μM) caused
dramatic apoptosis, ranging from ~35-80%, in all eight
melanoma cell lines/patient samples tested relative to the
DMSO control (P < 0.01 or less, Supplementary Figure S2).
However, the SC-2001 treatment had only a modest effect
on melanocytes (HEMNMP) (Supplementary Figure S2).
Furthermore, in a conventional mouse xenograft model,
SC-2001 significantly decreased the rate of tumor growth
compared to the control (P <0.001) (Figure 2E).

SC-2001 does not target the MIC population
Multiple studies have identified subpopulations
of melanoma cells that possess characteristics of CICs
including increased resistance to treatments [28, 30,
37, 42]]. One of the best in vitro methods used to study
CICs is the sphere formation assay [6] and it has been
successfully used to study MICs in many studies [37, 43–
46]. Melanoma-spheres display stem cell like functions
including self-renewability and tumorigenicity [46];
thus they can be used as a tool to enrich the cancer cell
population that exhibits stem-like features for testing

the potency of cancer drugs [25, 26, 47]. The primary
sphere assay helps enrich the MIC population while
a secondary sphere formation assay is an assay for
measuring the self-renewal capacity of MICs in vitro [37].
To determine whether SC-2001 treatment eliminated both
the bulk tumor cells and MIC population in the experiment
described in Figure 2E, we performed sphere-forming
assays starting from single cell suspensions isolated
from the aforementioned experiment. We found that
there was no significant difference in number of spheres
formed between the SC-2001 and DMSO treated samples
indicating that although SC-2001 could shrink the tumor
in a conventional xenograft model, it was unable to
effectively eliminate all the MICs (Figure 2F).

including ours, have shown that targeting single antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members is not sufficient to treat
melanoma [23, 37, 38], and that targeting both MCL-1
and BCL-2 is needed to eliminate the MIC population
[37]. We assessed if decreasing MCL-1 expression
by shRNA can synergize with a BCL-2 inhibitor to
abolish the MIC population in a sphere formation assay
(Figure 3A and 3B). Knockdown of MCL-1 (shMCL-1)
by itself, did not cause a significant decrease in the
number of spheres compared to the shControl. However,
when shMCL-1 cells were treated with the BCL-2
inhibitor ABT-737, there was a significant decrease in the
number of spheres (P<0.01) (Figure 3B). This suggested
that SC-2001 when combined with ABT-737 can be an
effective strategy to target the MICs.
We therefore examined the efficacy of SC-2001 by
itself and in combination with ABT-737 against MICs
using sphere forming assays on multiple melanoma cell
lines (Figure 3C and 3D). SC-2001 by itself did not
significantly inhibit either primary or secondary sphere
formation even at high concentrations (5 or 10 μM)
compared to DMSO. On the other hand, when combined
with ABT-737 (3.3 μM), it was very effective even at a
lower concentration (2.5 μM). The combination inhibited

Low dose SC-2001 plus ABT-737 targeted
the MIC population regardless of their
mutation status
Therapeutics with single molecular targets often
fail in cancer therapy, and the CIC populations are
thought to be reason for this. Thus, utilizing combination
therapies that eliminate this resistant cell population is an
emerging strategy to treat cancer [24, 48]. Many studies,

Figure 3: SC-2001 did not target the MIC population even at a high concentration (10 μM), while a lower concentration

shRNA (sh-Control) or shRNA against MCL-1 (sh-MCL-1), were subjected to: (A) Immunoblot for MCL-1 to confirm the knockdown;

(P<0.01). C. Primary sphere assays. For primary sphere assay in (B) and (C), the spheres were treated with the indicated concentration of

the formation of both the primary and secondary spheres
compared to DMSO or SC-2001 only (2.5, 5 or 10 μM)
(P < 0.05 or less) (Figure 3C and 3D). This decrease is
comparable to the effect observed for ABT-737 treatment
on sh-MCL-1 cell lines.
To further examine the effects of this combination,
we extended these assays to more melanoma samples,
particularly the short term cultures of tumor samples from
melanoma patients (Figure 4). Again, the samples tested
here include BRAF or NRAS mutated, as well as wild type
for BRAF, NRAS and NF1 (triple-WT) lines. The patient
samples include the ones relapsed from current treatments.
The spheres were allowed to grow up to reasonable size
until Day 5 after seeding before being treated with single
or combination drugs for 48 hrs. In thirteen out of fourteen
samples, the combination severely disrupted the primary
spheres compared with the control, ABT-737 or SC-2001
treatment alone (P< 0.05 or less, Figure 4A and  4B)
regardless their mutation status. The p-values for all
comparisons are separately listed in Supplementary Table
S2. Additionally, we performed immunoblot of PARP
cleavage, and further confirmed that the combination
treatment induced apoptosis in all the melanoma samples
tested (Supplementary Figure S3).

Multiple groups have found a positive correlation
between cancer cells expressing higher aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) and tumor formation efficiency
including melanoma [43, 45]. We and others have
previously established that cells with higher ALDH
activity are enriched with MICs [37, 43, 45]. Therefore, we
used an Aldefluor assay as an additional tool to examine
the effects of the combination treatment on the MIC
population (Figure 4C). In seven out of eight melanoma
cell lines with enough cells for statistical analyses, the
combination of SC-2001 and ABT-737 significantly
decreased the percentage of ALDHhigh cells compared with
both the DMSO control and ABT-737 alone regardless
their mutation status. (P < 0.05 or less) (Figure 4C).
The p-values for all comparisons are separately listed in
Supplementary Table S3. Interestingly, some of the patient
samples showed an increased percentage of ALDHhigh cells
compared with the DMSO control in response to the single
drug treatment. Unfortunately, we did not have enough
material for the last four patient samples to perform
enough assay replicates for statistical analyses. However,
the overall trend was similar relative to the other cell lines.
Taken together, the sphere assay and the ALDH
assay demonstrate that the combination of MCL-1 with

Figure 4: SC-2001 combined with ABT-737 targeted the MIC population of melanoma cells regardless of the mutation

less) in seven lines. Unfortunately, we did not have enough material to do additional replicates for last four samples, so we could not

BCL-2 inhibitors is better than either single drug to kill
the MICs.

these results showed that the combination prevented the
formation of secondary spheres and therefore decreased
MIC’s self-renewal capability in multiple cell lines.

SC-2001 combined with ABT-737 inhibited
the self-renewability of MICs

The combination of SC-2001 and ABT-737 inhibits
the MIC-mediated tumor formation in vivo

While the primary sphere-forming assay enriches the
population for stem-like cells, the secondary sphere assay
measures the cell population’s ability to regenerate after drug
treatment [46]. This was done by conducting the primary
sphere assay as described earlier, dissociating the primary
spheres into single cells, and then replating the cells at the
same viable cell density. However, we did not add additional
drugs during the secondary sphere portion of the assay. This
assay specifically assesses if any of the remaining viable
cells—those that escaped chemotherapeutics—are capable
of self-renewing and regenerating into a mass of tumor cells.
The combination treatment almost eliminated all
secondary sphere formation in eight out of nine melanoma
cell lines tested (Figure 5). Statistical analyses indicated
that the combination treatment significantly decreased
the number of secondary spheres formed compared with
DMSO, ABT-737 or SC-2001 treatment alone (P < 0.05 or
less) in eight out of nine lines tested (Figure 5A and 5B).
The p-values for all comparisons are separately listed in
Supplementary Table S4.
Visualization of these cells with EtBr/AO staining
indicated that the majority of the cells in the control or
single drug treatments were alive, but the majority of cells
in the combination treatments were dead (Figure 5C). Thus,

Conventional mouse xenograft studies implant tumor
cells at a very high cell number (> 1 million tumor cells) and
cannot reasonably assess the efficacy of a drug in preventing
the tumor initiating ability of CICs. Recently, Hirata
and colleagues examined the effects of the transcription
factor SphK1 on tumor initiating ability of breast CICs by
injecting a small amount (100,000 viable cells) of a CICenriched cell population into a mouse xenograft model [49].
Similar approaches have been used previously in assessing
tumor-initiating ability in other cancer stem cell studies
[49–52]. Here, we employed a similar xenograft method
with a low cell number implantation to test the differences
in tumor-initiating-ability between the control and treatment
groups. This xenograft method makes testing cancer
initiation more feasible than the standard series dilution
method. We also used melanoma cells derived from patients
whose tumors eventually relapsed from both BRAF/MEK
inhibitors and immunotherapy treatment (MB1860). These
tumors were only maintained and passaged in the PDX
model prior to this experiment.
We first treated sphere culture samples from a
relapsed patient with DMSO, single, or combined drugs
for 48 hrs in vitro. After the treatment, we implanted

inducing cell death when ABT-737 was used in combination
with other agents [23, 37, 38]. These two proteins are also
known to play important roles in regulating MCL-1 and
BCL-2 in melanoma [37]. Thus, to evaluate the mechanisms
behind the combination-induced cell death, we performed
immunoblot studies to examine the expression of these
two proteins. We found that the combination treatment
notably increased the expression of both NOXA and BIM
(Figure 7). Results were similar in BRAF mutated (A375,
HT144 and 451Lu), NRAS mutated (WM852c), and patient
melanoma cells (MB2309 and MB2141) (Figure 7).
To further determine whether this induction of NOXA
or BIM contributes to killing effects of the combination,
we examined the effects of knocking-down NOXA or
knocking-out BIM on the killing potency of the combination
of SC-2001 and ABT-737 on cells. We have established
stable cell lines with NOXA knockdown using an shRNAmediated approach [23], and found that knockdown of
NOXA significantly protected against the combinationinduced disruption of spheres (P<0.05) (Figure 8A to 8D)
in both BRAF and NRAS mutated melanoma cell lines.
In previous studies, we found the effects of
knocking-down BIM varied depending on the cell lines
used, probably due to incomplete knock-down of BIM
[37]. This is one of the limitations for shRNA technology
since the levels of knock down are achieved with variable
efficiency in most cases. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9

50,000 surviving viable cells from each group into mice
and then monitored the tumor growth in vivo as a readout
for the impact of each treatment on tumor-initiation ability.
Figure 6A shows that the combination group mice had the
longest tumor-free survival time compared to vehicle as
well as single drug group (P<0.001). Tumor incidence
rate was calculated as the number of tumors generated /
number of implantations expressed as percentage. Tumor
incidence rate was significantly lower in the combination
group compared with the vehicle or single treatment
group (P < 0.05) (Figure 6B). These results suggest that
the combination-treated populations contained fewer
MIC-like cells. To further confirm this, we performed
sphere-forming assays with the single cell suspensions
isolated from the surviving tumors, and found that the
combination significantly reduced the number of spheres
compared with vehicle or individual treatments (P < 0.001)
(Figure 6C). There was no significant difference between
the control and single-drug treated groups in all the above
three analyses. Taken together, results here suggest that the
combination reduced the MIC population.

The SC-2001 and ABT-737 combination induces
NOXA- and BIM-mediated killing of MICs
We have found previously that BH3 only proapoptotic proteins, NOXA and BIM, played a crucial role in

Figure 6: The combination of SC-2001 and ABT-737 inhibited the MIC-mediated tumor formation in vivo. The treatment

effects were tested in a xenograft model initiated with a low-number of MIC-enriched cells. For tumor injection, we used the surviving cells

injection. A. Tumor-free survival curve shows a significantly longer tumor–free time in the combination group, compared to the vehicle or

engineering/editing and is one of the most innovative
and revolutionary methods currently available for
modifying human genome [53, 54]. This enables making
modifications at the DNA level with permanent and
heritable changes in the genome much more feasible [55].
Thus we decided to knockout BIM expression using the
CRISPR-Cas9 technology (Figure 9). We used the same

system/vectors from Dr. Zhang’s group [56], which have
been used in a human melanoma cell line to screen for
genes that are involved in resistance to BRAF inhibitor
treatment [53, 54].
We successfully established multiple clones with
complete reduction of BIM protein expression in melanoma
cell lines with the CRISPR system (BIM KO) (Figure 9A
and 9B). Sphere-forming assays demonstrated that KO

of BIM also significantly protected the cells against the
combination-induced disruption of spheres (P<0.05 or less)
in both BRAF and NRAS mutated melanoma cell lines
(Figure 9C and 9D). In addition, Immunoblot assays also
indicated that the knockout (KO) of BIM reduced the drug
combination-induced PARP cleavage and dramatically
decreased the ratio of cleaved/full-length PARP (Figure 9B).
These data suggest the combination-induced killing is both
NOXA- and BIM- dependent.

2001 by itself eradicated the bulk of melanoma cells
in vitro regardless of the mutation status and inhibited
tumor growth in vivo (Figure 2). In this study, we use
the term “de-bulk” to describe the targeting of noncancer-initiating cells, as in many other manuscripts in
the research field of cancer stem/initiating cells [57–
60]. Taken together, these results indicate that the SC2001 could be a promising treatment option to de-bulk
melanomas in vitro and in vivo.
Despite the efficacy of SC-2001, it was unable to
target the MIC population (Figure 2F). This suggests that
combinatorial treatments may be required to eliminate
the resistant subpopulations of melanoma such as MICs.
In support of this idea, we have demonstrated here that
knocking down MCL-1 sensitizes the MIC population
to ABT-737 (Figure 3A and 3B). This supports the
hypothesis that combining MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibitors
will effectively target the MIC sub-population.
In vitro, we tested this hypothesis utilizing primary/
secondary sphere formation assays and an ALDH activity
assay to assess the effects of this combination on MICs
from multiple melanoma cultures (Figure 4 and 5). It
is well established in the cancer-stem-cell field that the
primary sphere assay and ALDH assay measure the
relative amount of MIC cells while the secondary sphere
assay measures the capacity of self-renewal ability [43,

DISCUSSION
This study is the first to examine the efficacy of
MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibitors in combination to induce
killing of both bulk melanoma cells and MICs. Consistent
with other reports we found higher endogenous MCL-1
expression in most melanomas compared to melanocytes
in both cell lines and tumor samples from patients
(Figure 1) [21, 39]. This data also suggests that the higher
expression of MCL-1 in melanomas is independent of the
mutation status for BRAF or NRAS. Therefore, the antiapoptotic protein MCL-1 is a potential treatment target for
a broad range of melanomas.
We first tested the effects of the novel MCL1 inhibitor SC-2001 in multiple assays in vitro and in
a conventional xenograft mouse model in vivo. SC-

45, 46, 61]. The combination of SC-2001 and ABT-737
effectively eliminated the MIC population regardless of
the mutation status in the primary sphere assay (Figure 4).
Additionally, only the combination treatment significantly
decreased self-renewal capacity by inhibiting the regrowth of tumor cells in the secondary sphere assay
(Figure 5). Excitingly, these results were observed even in
the melanomas that have relapsed from molecular-targeted
or immune-therapies and also those with varying genetic
backgrounds (wild type or mutated for BRAF, NRAS, or
NF1). This data collectively suggests that this combination
effectively targets the MIC population and may overcome
melanoma’s resistance to current therapies.
We further explored the effects of the SC-2001 and
ABT-737 combination on the tumor initiating ability of the
MIC population in vivo using a modified xenograft model.
This was initiated with a small amount of remaining viable
cells from MIC-enriched populations after being treated
to test for differences in tumor initiating ability. We found
that only the combination treatment significantly increased
the duration of tumor-free time and decreased tumor
incidence (Figure 6A and 6B). This result was further
confirmed using secondary sphere-forming assays with
single cell suspensions isolated from the surviving tumors
(Figure 6C). These results suggest that the combination
significantly decreased the MIC-mediated tumor initiating
ability in vivo. This further supports that an MCL-1/BCL2 co-targeting strategy could be beneficial for melanoma
patients, especially those relapsed from other treatments.
Despite the high efficacy of this combination in the
experiments reported here, not all patient samples that were
tested responded to the combination treatment. Sample
MB1823 was resistant to the combination in the primary
sphere assay, and MB1374 was resistant in the secondary
sphere assay. Further studies are needed to determine why
those two tumor samples did not respond and to identify
any potential biomarkers that could be predictive of the
success of this combination treatment. Moreover, CICs are
not the only factors contributing to tumor heterogeneity
or resistance to treatment, and others may include cellular
plasticity and phenotypic switching [62–65]. Future studies
are needed to examine how this combination treatment
may affect these aspects of melanoma.
In addition to inhibiting MCL-1, SC-2001 has been
reported to induce cell death through SHP-1 dependent
STAT3 inactivation in liver and breast cancer cells [33,
34]. However, we did not detect any consistent changes
in SHP-1 or STAT3 upon treatment in our experiments
(data not shown). Instead, one of the main mechanisms
responsible for the combination induced MIC death
observed here is the up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic
proteins NOXA and BIM (Figure 7). In support of this
idea, an increase in the expression of NOXA and BIM
occurred upon treatment in both mutated BRAF and
NRAS cell lines along with melanoma patient samples
(Figure 7). In addition, the knock-down of NOXA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(shRNA) or the knock-out of BIM (CRISPR-Cas 9
technology) significantly protected against combinationinduced cell death (Figure 8 and 9). The protection we
have seen for loss of either NOXA or BIM alone was
23-28%, which was commonly seen in other studies with
BCL-2 family members [37, 66–68]. Multiple members in
the BCL-2 family may coordinate and control the balance
of life and death in the cells, therefore each protein likely
only contribute partial effects.
Both NOXA and BIM are pro-apoptotic members of
the BCL-2 protein family, and both can interact with MCL-1
and abolish the functions of MCL-1 [69]. Upregulation
of NOXA can sensitize various cancer cell types to ABT737 including melanoma [70–72]. TRAIL-induced MCL-1
inhibition leads to BIM-mediated apoptosis [73]. NOXAMCL-1-BIM interplay is also important for apoptosis
induced by drugs such as microtubule-targeting agents
[74]. Our results also confirm the important roles of both
proteins in antagonizing MCL-1 in melanoma, and that
indeed NOXA-MCL-1-BIM axis can play a crucial role
in the combination-induced killing of melanoma cells
including the MICs.
The exciting CRISPR/Cas9 technology has
advanced the gene-editing methodology tremendously,
because it makes it possible to easily and inexpensively
edit genetic information in virtually any organism,
including human cells. This method also is more superior
than shRNAs since you can knockout the gene of
interest [55, 75]. We successfully used the CRISPR/Cas
9 technique to knock out BIM in our mechanistic study.
Many recent studies suggest that off-target effects are
rare for the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system [75–78].
In addition, we used two different gRNAs to delete BIM,
and analyzed multiple BIM-null clones. Thus, it is very
unlikely that the results obtained using these BIM-null
lines are due to off-target effects.
A potentially significant anecdotal observation is
that we have been unable to establish stable knockdown
lines with a significant reduction in MCL-1 expression
levels. Increasing the titer of the viral particles used
significantly increases the level of killing during infection
compared to shRNA vectors targeting other genes. We
have also attempted to make MCL-1-null lines using
CRISPR/Cas9 in three different melanoma cell lines
using three different gRNAs against MCL-1. However,
we could not find any clones lacking MCL-1 expression.
Although indirect, this data further supports the idea that
MCL-1 is essential for the survival of melanoma cells and
is therefore an attractive therapeutic target for melanoma.
Designing a potent MCL-1 inhibitor is a huge
challenge as directly inhibiting this target requires the
disruption of high-affinity protein–protein interactions
[79, 80]. SC-2001 is a derivative of Obatoclax, but both
are small molecule BCL-2-, BCL-XL-, BCL-W-, and
MCL-1 inhibitors which act on the intrinsic pathway
[81]. Both compounds have been shown to inhibit
46810

Cell lines, patient samples and culture conditions
in monolayer and sphere cultures

MCL-1 by interrupting its interactions with other BCL-2
pro-apoptotic members [33, 82, 83]. Based on previous
work and the work shown here, both compounds also
act by increasing NOXA expression to antagonize
MCL-1 [81, 82]. Obatoclax has been in clinical trials,
but there are reports of some off-target effects [81].
Even though SC-2001 is reported to have better growth
inhibition and death-inducing potential than Obatoclax in
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines [33], the study here
can not completely rule out the possible contribution
of off-target effects in our experiments. Recently,
A-1210477 has been described as the most potent
MCL-1 inhibitor available to date inducing clear ontarget cellular activity. A-1210477 selectively disrupts
MCL-1–NOXA and MCL-1–BIM complexes in living
cells [80]. It was also demonstrated that A-121047 can
synergize with the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-263 in killing
lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and multiple myeloma
cell lines [80, 84]. It will be very interesting to study
the clinical relevance and efficacy of this compound on
killing melanoma cells and MICs.
Taken together, this work is of interest to
both clinicians and researchers due to its following
novelties: 1) Targeting MCL-1 and other BCL-2
family members is a promising approach to kill the
bulk of melanoma cells, and most importantly, also
the MICs. 2) This study also tested the effectiveness
in melanoma cells from patients relapsed from current
treatments, and in melanoma with wild type BRAF
status which have fewer treatment options currently. 3)
This study utilized the cutting-edge genomic-editing
tool of CRISPR/Cas9 system to address the role of
BIM in these treatments.
In summary, the data presented here suggests that
MCL-1 is a promising target for treating melanomas
and that SC-2001 is effective at killing non-melanomainitiating cells. However, the combination treatment
with both MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibitors is capable
of eliminating MICs which is needed to hinder
relapse potential and block tumor regeneration. These
treatments may be effective for melanoma regardless
of the mutation status of BRAF or NRAS and may help
overcome melanoma’s resistance to current treatments.
These results underline the need for developing potent
and selective MCL-1 inhibitors that can be used in
clinical trials.

Human melanoma metastatic cell lines A375,
1205Lu, SK-MEL-28, 451Lu, and HT-144 were obtained
from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and WM852c was kindly
provided by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn. NRAS mutated
melanoma lines (SK-MEL-2, Hs852T) and patient-derived
melanoma cell lines were provided by the Melanoma
bank at University of Colorado Cancer center. Primary
melanocytes were obtained from Life Technologies
(Carlsbad, CA), and immortalized melanocytes PIG1 were
kindly provided by Dr. Le Poole [85].
Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc., West Sacramento, CA).
Melanocytes were maintained in Medium 254 with Human
Melanocyte Growth Supplement-2 (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). To mimic melanoma culture conditions,
10% FBS was added for drug assays.
All sphere assays were performed with poly-hema
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) coated plates or dishes [86], in
stem cell media as described previously [27, 87, 88].
Specifically, the media contained DME/F12 (Hyclone)
supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL EGF
and 20 ng/mL bFGF (BD Biosciences), and 4 μg/mL
heparin (Sigma). Cells were seeded at the density of
1-5 viable cell/µl for melanoma cell lines and 10-20
viable cell/µl for the patient derived samples for all
sphere assays.
Patient samples were only cultured in vitro for
a short term (within 6 month of receipt) and some of
the them were only maintained in a PDX model as
described in [43, 89], so that they retain original tumor
characteristics such as expression and mutation profiles.
Xenografted tumors of F2-F4 generations were harvested
and frozen as single-cell suspensions before being used
in this study, and were prepared according to the method
described in [89]. These patient samples were derived
from melanoma biopsy samples of patients relapsed
from various treatments. These melanoma cultures were
validated by the bank with Melanoma Triple Cocktail
staining. Melanoma Triple Cocktail (Ventana Medical
Systems, Inc, Tucson, AZ) is an antibody cocktail of antiMelanosome (HMB45), anti-MART-1/melan A (A103),
and anti-Tyrosinase (T311) mouse monoclonal antibodies.
The patient samples either harbored BRAF mutation
(MB2309 and MB1823), NRAS mutation (MB1920 and
PS4) or were triple-WT (wild type for BRAF, NRAS
and NF1) (MB2141, and MB1374). The samples were
collected after patients relapsed from the following
treatments: Immunotherapy (MB1823) or BRAF-MEK
inhibitors (MB2309) or multiple drugs/radiation/surgery
(MB2141, MB1374).

Measurement of cell proliferation, cytotoxicity,
apoptosis and ALDH activity

expanded and tested to select for the complete knock-out,
and screened and verified by immunoblotting of cell lysates.

The Cell Titer 96™ Aqueous One solution
cell proliferation assay (ATP assay; Promega Corp.,
Madison, WI) was used to quantify cell viability, as
instructed by the manufacturer. The cytotoxicity assay
was conducted using the luminescent cyto-tox glo kit
(Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in a 96 well format,
as instructed by the manufacturer. Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) was used to quantify apoptosis according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry using a Beckman Coulter FC500 with CXP
software (Hialeah, FL) in the University of Colorado
Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core. The Aldefluor
kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) was
used to detect the ALDH activity according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The Aldefluor staining was
detected using the FITC channel and analyzed at the
University of Colorado Cancer Center Flow Cytometry
Core. At least three repeats were done for each cell line.
The data was normalized as the relative fold in order to
visualize the change of ALDH positive cells compared
to the DMSO control, with the percentage of ALDHhigh
cells in DMSO condition set as “1”.

Immunoblot
Cells, both floating and adherent, were harvested
with 1x Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Samples were used in the standard western blot
analysis protocol as described previously [90]. The
following antibodies were used at suggested dilutions
from the manufacturers: PARP1 (PARP), and TUBB2A
(α/β Tubulin) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA);
PMAIP1 (NOXA, EMD Biosciences, Inc. San Diego,
CA); MCL1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA); BIM
(Millipore, Billerica, MA), β-actin (Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and
anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immuno-Research, West
Grove, PA). Immunoblots were typically performed 2-3
times for each cell line, and representative examples are
shown. Immunoblot data was quantified using Image
Studio Ver. 2.0 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE).

Primary and secondary sphere forming assays
Primary sphere assay
Cells were plated at a density of 1-20 viable cell/µl.
Fresh media was added every 2-3 days. The spheres were
allowed to grow up to reasonable size until Day 5 after
seeding and then treated with indicated drugs on day 5.
After 48 hrs, the numbers of spheres were counted and
images captured using Nikon Eclipse TS100 scope fitted
with Nikon DS-Fi2 camera.

Creation of short hairpin RNA transduced
cell lines
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expressing cell lines
against various BCL2 family members were created as
described previously [23]. Knockdown of genes of interest
was measured by immunoblotting of cell lysates.

Secondary sphere assay
Primary spheres, formed as mentioned above for
indicated drug treatments, were dissociated into single
cells and replated as described in [39, 41]. The procedures
were the same as for the primary sphere assay, except that
no drugs were added during the secondary sphere assays.
At least three repeats of both the primary and
secondary sphere assays were done for each cell line. The
data were normalized as the relative spheres in percentage
compared to the vehicle (DMSO) control, and the number
of spheres in the DMSO was set at “100”. The ethidium
bromide/acridine orange stainingassay, as described
previously [91, 92], was used to estimate live, dead, or
apoptotic cells of the secondary spheres dissociated with
PBS-EDTA [37].

Creation of CRISPR mediated cell lines
BCL-2 family member BIM was knocked out by
CRISPR /Cas9 technology. The protocol was followed
from [54]. Briefly, the cells were first subjected to Cas-9
lentiviral transduction and then selected for Blasticydin
resistance for 5 days. The Blasticydin-resistance Cas9 transduced cell lines were then subjected to BIM
gRNA lentiviral transduction. Functional Genomics
Core at UC Boulder provided CRISPR/Cas9 related
vectors, which were provided by Dr. Feng Zhang lab
(The Broad Institute and the McGovern Institute of Brain
Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
[56]. Two different gRNA sequences of the lenti-guide
puro-vectors are GCCCAAGAGTTGCGGCGTAT and
CAACCACTATCTCAGTGCAA. After transduction, cells
were selected with puromycin so that only cells transduced
with a stable construct are preserved. The cells were then
seeded in 96-well plate at the density of 1 cell/well using
MoFlo XDP100 Cell sorter by the University of Colorado
Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core. The single cells were
maintained for clonal expansion and each of the clones were

approximately 100 mm3. Mice were randomly divided
into two treatment groups consisting of at least 10 tumors
each group: 1) vehicle only, 2) SC-2001 only. SC-2001
was administered (PO) at 10 mg/kg every alternate day,
for 21days. Mice were weighed daily and tumor volume
was measured every alternate day with digital calipers.

MIC-mediated tumor xenograft
In this experiment, we employed a modified xenograft
method with a low cell number implantation to test the
differences in tumor initiating ability between the control
and treatment groups. Melanoma sample MB1860 was
used in this experiment. These cells were only maintained
in the PDX model prior to this. The cells in the single-cell
suspension were cultured in sphere condition, and treated
with the indicated concentration of DMSO, single, or
combined drug for 48hrs. Spheres were then dissociated
into the single cell suspension and 50,000 viable cells
were injected in each flank of nude mice and tumors were
allowed to grow. Mice were weighed and tumor growth
was measured as a readout for the impact of the single/
combination treatment on tumor-initiation ability. Tumors
were examined every alternate day. Tumor incidence was
determined when the tumor was palpable and about 75 mm3
in size. Mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment
and tumors were collected and dissociated into single
cell suspension to perform sphere assays. This modified
xenograft method makes testing cancer initiation more
feasible than the standard series dilution method. Similar
approaches have been used previously in assessing tumor
initiating ability in other cancer stem cell studies [49–52].
