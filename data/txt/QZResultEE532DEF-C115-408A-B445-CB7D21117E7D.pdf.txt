Abstract
Signal transduction modifiers that modulate the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) pathway have potential as anticancer
agents. Herein, we describe metabolically stabilized LPA
analogues that reduce cell migration and invasion and cause
regression of orthotopic breast tumors in vivo. Two diastereoisomeric A-bromophosphonates (BrP-LPA) were synthesized, and the pharmacology was determined for five LPA G
protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). The syn and anti diastereomers of BrP-LPA are pan-LPA GPCR antagonists and are
also nanomolar inhibitors of the lysophospholipase D activity
of autotaxin, the dominant biosynthetic source of LPA.
Computational models correctly predicted the diastereoselectivity of antagonism for three GPCR isoforms. The anti isomer
of BrP-LPA was more effective than syn isomer in reducing
migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, and the anti isomer was
superior in reducing invasion of these cells. Finally, orthotopic
breast cancer xenografts were established in nude mice by
injection of MB-231 cells in an in situ cross-linkable
extracellular matrix. After 2 weeks, mice were treated with
the BrP-LPA alone (10 mg/kg), Taxol alone (10 mg/kg), or
Taxol followed by BrP-LPA. All treatments significantly
reduced tumor burden, and BrP-LPA was superior to Taxol
in reducing blood vessel density in tumors. Moreover, both
the anti- and syn-BrP-LPA significantly reduced tumors at
3 mg/kg. [Cancer Res 2009;69(13):5441–9]

Introduction
Lipid signaling in cancer is dominated by the signal transduction
through two pathways involving overproduction of two phosphorylated lipids: phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). In both pathways, down-regulated
tumor suppressors and up-regulated oncogenes result in a systemic
or local overproduction of these potent agonists, and these defects
are present in many advanced cancers. Quite recently, therapeutically important inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (1)
responsible for PIP3 production have entered the clinic (2).
However, anticancer agents that modify signaling through the
LPA signaling pathway (3–6) remain in preclinical research,

although the molecular understanding of pathway has greatly
increased (7).
LPA signaling occurs via six receptors belonging to the seven
transmembrane G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) protein
family, now LPA1 to LPA6. The first three, LPA1 to LPA3, formerly
EDG2, EDG4, and EDG7 (8), are expressed from endothelial
differentiation genes (edg ). The recently deorphaned receptors
GPR23/P2Y9 (9), GPR92 (10), and GPR87 (11), designated as LPA4,
LPA5, and LPA6, belong to the purinergic cluster of GPCRs. Cancer
cells of different cellular origins express LPA GPCRs in differing
amounts, e.g., LPA1 is widely expressed in cancer cells, whereas
LPA4 is expressed at low levels. Ovarian and breast cancer cells
express multiple LPA GPCR isoforms, and LPA accumulates in
tumor cell ascites and effusates (4, 5).
LPA elicits growth factor–like effects in most cell types. LPA is
implicated in physiologic responses that include immunologic
competence, brain development, wound healing, coagulation, and
regulation of blood pressure. The pleiotropic physiologic functions
of LPA contribute to pathophysiologic states that include cancer,
atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia reperfusion injury, and
prevention of radiation-induced toxicity (12). As GPCRs, LPA
receptors should be amenable to the development of highly specific
and potent agonists or antagonists. Validated compounds are
essential to advance in vivo studies and to minimize off-target
effects. To address this need, we developed bioactive analogues of
LPA that resist phosphatase, acyl transferase, and lipase activities
(13, 14).
LPA and its structural analogues all have a polar head group, a
linker, and a hydrophobic tail (Fig. 1A). Hydrolysis of the phosphate
head group of LPA by ubiquitous phosphatases deactivates LPA,
but modifications at this site are the least well tolerated. Stable
phosphomimetics that are micromolar or submicromolar LPA
agonists include phosphonates, e.g., a-hydroxymethylene phosphonates (15) and a-fluoromethylene phosphonates (16).
Targeting the biosynthesis of LPA is also a valid target for
therapeutic development. The lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD)
activity of the tumor-associated protein autotaxin (ATX) converts
lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to LPA (17, 18). ATX is the
product of 1 of the 40 most up-regulated genes in invasive
cancers and is implicated in cell motility and tumor invasion,
metastasis, and neovascularization (19, 20). ATX is feedback
inhibited by its product LPA (21). Thus, the ideal anticancer
drug targeting LPA signaling would simultaneously abrogate
signaling through the GPCRs and attenuate LPA production by
ATX (5). Indeed, we previously observed that the palmitoyl abromomethylenephosphonate 1 (Fig. 1A; BrP-LPA) was a panantagonist for LPA1, LPA2, LPA3, and LPA4 GPCRs (15). This

diastereomeric mixture also inhibited over 98% of ATX activity
at 10 Amol/L.
Herein, we describe the enantioselective syntheses of the syn and
anti diastereomers of BrP-LPA. Computational modeling of the syn
and anti diastereomers predict the independently determined
in vitro pharmacology and cell biology of these diastereomers. Next,
we show that each diastereoisomer inhibits ATX and inhibit cell
migration and invasion. Finally, treatment with BrP-LPA diastereomers causes tumor regression and decreased tumor vascularity
in vivo in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model (22, 23).

Receptor activation. Assays for mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ were
performed as described (15, 24), with details in the Supplementary Data.
Each test was performed in quadruplicate. EC50, IC50, and K i values were
calculated by fitting a sigmoid function to data points (25).
Molecular modeling. Docking simulations were performed using
Autodock 3.0 (26). The compounds were constructed using MOE with a
2 charge on the phosphate, and geometry was optimized with MMFF94
(27). Each compound was flexibly docked in inactive models (28) of LPA1-3.
A mol2 format file of the receptor consisting of the structure coordinates
with MMFF94 charges was generated in MOE. The receptor input file was
prepared using the molto2pdbqs utility, and ligands were prepared with
Autotors. A docking box was defined to encompass the binding site (28).
Default parameters of Autodock 3.0 were used, except for energy
evaluations (9  1010), genetic algorithm search generations (3  104),
maximum local search iterations (3  103), and 15 runs. A single complex
was selected for each ligand-receptor combination based on both rank and
proximity of ligand phosphate group to R3.28. Usually, the top-ranked
structure showed close interaction with R3.28 and was selected. For

1a-LPA3, the second-ranked structure was selected. The selected complexes
were minimized with MMFF94 and interactions were analyzed.
ATX assay. Using FS-3 (ref. 29; Echelon Biosciences, Inc.) as substrate
and recombinant hemagglutinin-tagged ATX (ATX-HA), 50 AL of ATX-HA
(0.25 Ag) in assay buffer [Tris 50 mmol/L, NaCl 140 mmol/L, KCl
5 mmol/L, CaCl2 1 mmol/L, MgCl2 1 mmol/L (pH 8.0)] was mixed with
25 AL of FS-3 ( final, 1 Amol/L) and 25 AL of test compound dissolved in
assay buffer with 1:1.5 bovine serum albumin in 96-well plate. FS-3
fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 538 nm,
respectively, were monitored using a FLEXstation II for 2 h of incubation
at 37jC. The differences between time of 0 and 120 min were calculated
individually and normalized to the vehicle control. The mean F SD of
triplicate sample wells was expressed as percentage of ATX inhibition.
Significant difference compared with vehicle was determined by the
Student’s t test at a P value of 0.05 (25).
Scratch wound assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in triplicate into
six-well plates at 3  105 per well. At 48 h, the confluent cell layer was
scratched using a sterile pipette tip. Nonadherent cells and cellular debris
were removed by washing (PBS). Fresh medium containing BrP-LPA 1, synBrP-LPA 1a, or anti-BrP-LPA 1b (1–100 Amol/L) was added to the scratched
monolayers. Cells were observed and digitally photographed. Inhibition of
migration was assessed and quantified by using ImageJ (30).
Xenograft establishment and chemotherapy. Female nu/nu mice
(ages, 4–6 wk; Charles River Laboratories) were anesthetized by i.p. injection
of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), as approved by the
University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Before
inoculation, MDA-MB-231 cells were trypsinized and resuspended in
Extracel (Glycosan BioSystems) with a final concentration of 5  107
cells/mL, and the resulting suspension was mixed gently. An aliquot of 200
AL of the mixture was injected s.c. into the fourth mammary fat pad of each
mouse. The mice were randomly divided into treatment groups and control
groups (six mice per group). Treatments were Taxol (10 mg/kg), BrP-LPA 1
(10 mg/kg), or Taxol (10 mg/kg) followed by BrP-LPA 1 (10 mg/kg). The
control was physiologic saline. Injections (i.p.) were performed twice per
week for 2 wk, starting 2 wk after the cell transplantation. Tumor sizes were
measured and calculated: tumor size (mm3) = [width (mm)]2  [length
(mm)] / 2. After sacrifice, tumor tissue was removed for histogical H&E and
immunohistochemistry using an anti-CD31 antibody. CD31 in zinc-fixed
paraffin sections was detected using antirat immunoglobulin horseradish
peroxidase detection kit (BD Bioscience). Microvessels were counted at
400 magnification, and the data were converted to microvessel density
(vessels/mm2), with 1 microscopic field = 0.196 mm2. Six fields were
randomly chosen for quantification in three slides for each treatment group
tumor tissue.
The effect of syn-BrP-LPA 1a and anti-BrP-LPA 1b were evaluated
separately after an analogous protocol. The cell suspension injection
volume was reduced to 100 AL, and dosages were 3 mg/kg for 1a and 1b.

Statistical methods. Data from in vitro and in vivo experiments are
expressed as the mean F SD of at least triplicate determinations. Statistical
comparisons were performed by Student’s t test, and differences were
considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Diastereoselective synthesis and absolute stereochemistry.
The synthesis of the individual diastereoisomers 1a (syn) and 1b
(anti) used a stereocontrolled bromination of the separated ahydroxymethylene phosphonates (Fig. 1B). Aldehyde 4 was
prepared in two steps in high yield from acetonide 3 and converted
to the diastereomeric mixture of a-hydroxymethylene phosphonates 5a and 5b. Although this mixture was not readily separable,
the TES ethers 6a and 6b could be separated by flash
chromatography, and the silyl group could be readily removed.
Using purified isomer 5b, bromination was performed at high
dilution (1 g of 5b in 80 mL) in 12:1 toluene:pyridine to optimize
the yield (Fig. 1B ). After acetonide deprotection, selective
palmitoylation, and hydrogenation, the pure anti diastereomer 1b
was obtained in quantitative yield. The syn diastereoisomer 1a was
obtained similarly, starting with 5a.
The stereochemical assignment of the absolute configuration of
a-position was accomplished by two-dimensional NMR analysis of
1,3-diol acetonide (31, 32). Thus, isomer 6b was converted in
several steps (deprotection, selective silylation, acetonide formation) to acetonide 7b (Supplementary Fig. S1). The absolute
configuration of the a-C in 7b was confirmed by coupling
constants and 1H-1H NOESY. Specifically, NOEs were observed
between H1 and H3, H1 and H2e, and H3 and H2e, establishing a syn1,3-relationship in phosphonate 7b. In 7a, no NOEs were observed
between H1 and H3, confirming the anti-1,3 relative stereochemistry. In addition, the acetonide methyls of 7b displayed 13C NMR
chemical shifts characteristic of the acetonide of a syn-1,3-diol (31).
Receptor activation assays. The ligand properties of the
compounds were evaluated using a Ca2+ mobilization assay to
assess activation or inhibition of LPA1, LPA2, LPA3, and LPA5
expressed in RH7777 cells and LPA4 expressed in Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells. Table 1 illustrates calcium responses elicited
through the response of human LPA1, LPA2, LPA3, LPA4, and LPA5
receptors to syn-BrP-LPA 1a, anti-BrP-LPA 1b, and BrP-LPA 1.
These cell lines are used extensively for characterization of LPA
GPCR ligands, because RH7777 cells are intrinsically unresponsive

Figure 2. Docked complexes of syn-1a and anti-1b in LPA1-3 accurately predict pharmacology. Syn -1a and anti -1b are ball-and-stick models, receptor residues are
labeled stick models, and ribbons show the protein backbone (red, amino terminus; blue, carboxy terminus). A, typical view shows the syn isomer 1a in the LPA2

receptor with 1a and 1b have green lines.

to LPA, whereas wild-type CHO cells show minimal endogenous
responses to LPA (5, 9, 25, 33).
The diastereomeric mixture BrP-LPA 1 (prepared from unseparated isomers 5a and 5b) showed pan-antagonist activity for
stably transfected receptors LPA1-4 submicromolar potency toward
LPA2, modest inhibition of LPA activation of LPA4, and weak partial
agonism for the transiently transfected LPA5. The syn-BrLPA 1a
was a pan-antagonist for the edg family GPCRs, showing K i values
of 273, 250, and 1830 nmol/L for LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3, respectively.
For the purinergic family GPCRs, syn-BrLPA 1a was an antagonist
for LPA4 but a weak agonist for LPA5. Apparently, the overall
agonist effect dominates in the mixed diastereomers. By comparison, anti-BrP-LPA 1b was a pan-antagonist for the edg family
GPCRs, with K i values of 752, 241, and 623 nmol/L for LPA1, LPA2,
and LPA3, respectively. In addition, anti-BrP-LPA 1b was an
antagonist for the two purinergic family GPCRs, with partial
antagonism of LPA on LPA4 and a K i value of 376 nmol/L for LPA5.
Molecular modeling of diastereoisomers with LPA1, LPA2,
and LPA3. Molecular models of the complexes formed by syn-BrPLPA 1a and anti-BrP-LPA 1b with LPA1-3 were created without
prior knowledge of the pharmacologic results. The models showed
ionic interactions between the 1a or 1b phosphate groups and
basic residues in the NH2 terminus, third transmembrane domain,
and seventh transmembrane domain in LPA1-3 (Fig. 2). The basic
NH2 terminal residues showed variable position and type, with
LPA1 interacting via R36, LPA2 interacting via H91, and LPA3
interacting via K95. The interacting residue in the third
transmembrane domain is the conserved arginine appearing at
position 3.28, a residue that is critical for both LPA recognition by
EDG family LPA receptors (34–36) and S1P recognition by the EDG

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

family S1P receptors (36, 37). The interacting residue in the seventh
transmembrane domain of LPA1 and LPA2 is K7.36, whereas LPA3
uses R7.36. Moreover, K7.35 in LPA3, not R7.36, is essential for LPA
recognition, although this lysine is replaced by an acidic residue in
LPA1 and LPA2 (36). The hydrophobic tails interact primarily with
residues in the extracellular loops, consistent with previous models
of LPA receptor antagonism (24, 25, 28). The geometries of these
complexes accurately predicted that both syn-BrP-LPA 1a and antiBrP-LPA 1b would antagonize LPA action at all three EDG family
LPA receptors by competing for interaction at R3.28 and without
independent agonist activity due to their lack of hydrophobic
interactions within the transmembrane domain.
Inhibition of ATX. The inhibition of ATX by BrP-LPA 1, synBrP-LPA 1a, and anti-BrP-LPA 1b was measured at concentrations
of 0.01 to 10 Amol/L and compared with the ATX inhibitory effects
of 10 Amol/L LPA (18:1) and 10 Amol/L 2ccLPA (16:1; ref. 38;
Supplementary Fig. S2). ATX activity was measured by the
hydrolysis of the fluorogenic lysoPC analogue FS-3, with a K m
value of 6.3 Amol/L (29). Preliminary results showed that each
analogue inhibited >98% of ATX at 10 Amol/L. A clear doseresponse effect on inhibition was observed for both syn-BrP-LPA
1a (IC50 = 165 nmol/L) and anti-BrP-LPA 1b (IC50 = 22 nmol/L;
Supplementary Fig. S2).
Inhibition of migration. BrP-LPA can both significantly reduce
LPA production and block activation of cell surface LPA receptors.
Such a molecule has clear therapeutic potential to reduce LPAinduced cell migration, invasion, and proliferation (5, 38, 39). Thus,
we evaluated the effect of the analogues on MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells using a scratch wound assay (Fig. 3A). The relative
expression of LPA GPCRs in MDA-MB-231 cells is LPA1 > LPA2 >>

LPA Signaling Antagonist Inhibits Metastatic Phenotype

LPA3, and LPA1 seems to be the key in mediating cell migration of
normal and neoplastic cells (40). After treatment with pure
diastereomers 1a and 1b and the mixture BrP-LPA 1, cells were
allowed to migrate into the denuded area for 0, 16, and 24 hours. By
24 hours, untreated control cells completely filled the scratched
area. Treatment with syn-BrP-LPA 1a and anti-BrP-LPA 1b at 10
and 40 Amol/L inhibited the MDA-MB-231 cell migration (Fig. 3B).
Migration of MB-231 cells was decreased by 57% (P < 0.05) by 40
Amol/L anti-BrP-LPA 1b when compared with the untreated
control. The mixed diastereomers showed intermediate inhibition
of cell migration (data not shown).
Inhibition of invasion. Using an in vitro invasion assay, MDAMB-231 cells invaded through Matrigel-coated transwell membranes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Treatment with anti-BrP-LPA 1a
or syn-BrP-LPA 1b inhibited the invasion by f52% (P < 0.05), but
the potencies of the two isomers were not significantly different.
This suggests that connecting the complex biology of invasion to
specific aspects of pharmacology of individual receptors or ATX
inhibition will require additional investigation.
Tumor regression in engineered orthotopic breast tumor
xenografts. To evaluate BrP-LPA in vivo, we used ‘‘tumor
engineering’’ to create orthotopic breast tumors in nude mice
(22, 23). In the first experiment, we compared BrP-LPA 1 alone with

Taxol alone. We also simulated a dual-drug therapy approach by
administering Taxol followed by the mixed diastereomers 1. Thus,
s.c. mammary fat pad injection of MDA-MB-231 cells suspended in
a semisynthetic extracellular matrix (sECM, Extracel) in nu/nu
mice resulted in tumor growth at each injection site. Figure 4
shows the increase in tumor volumes during the growth phase and
decrease in tumor volumes during the treatment phase. During the
first 2 wk, the tumor cells expand within the volume of the injected
sECM. The gross size of the bolus changes little, but the tumor cell
density increases dramatically as cells proliferate, degrade the
sECM, and secrete their own ECM. After 2 weeks of tumor growth,
the control group was treated with four i.p. injections of
physiologic saline over the course of 2 weeks. The first treatment
group received i.p. injections of Taxol (10 mg/kg), and the second
treatment group received i.p. injections of BrP-LPA 1 (10 mg/kg),
twice per week for 2 weeks. The third treatment group received two
injections of Taxol (10 mg/kg) for week 1 and two injections of BrPLPA 1 (10 mg/kg) for week 2. In each of the three treatment groups,
a reduction of tumor size relative to controls was observed shortly
after the first therapeutic injection (Fig. 4A).
To examine the separate effects of the two diastereomers, synBrP-LPA 1a and anti-BrP-LPA 1b, a second xenograft study was
performed using analogous protocols, except that the size of the

each isomer significantly decreased the tumor volume relative to
the control group (P < 0.01), there was no significant difference

After completion of the 2-week treatment course for the study in

each treatment group were significantly decreased or undetectable.
At necropsy, tumors were surgically removed and prepared for
histologic analysis. The largest tumor in the treatment group with
diastereomeric mixture 1 was significantly smaller than the
smallest tumor in the control group (Fig. 5A). H&E staining
revealed an irregular arrangement of tumor cells, inflammatory
granuloma tissue, and an increased number of blood vessels

vasculature was observed using immunohistochemical staining
with anti-CD31 antibody (Fig. 5C). Quantification of the newly

significant reduction of angiogenesis in the mice treated with the
LPA antagonist mixture 1 relative to the controls or either of the

Discussion
Computational modeling predicts pharmacology. The docking of syn-BrP-LPA 1a and BrP-LPA 1b with GPCRs LPA1-3 were
performed computationally without knowledge of the pharmacologic outcomes. The predictions from the models were gratifyingly
congruent with the relative antagonist activity at LPA1-3, lending
credibility to the predictive power of the model. Distances between
phosphate groups of 1a and 1b and basic residues in each LPA
receptor model provide a molecular context for the relative
potencies observed experimentally (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 1).
For example, the phosphate of 1a interacts more closely with the
cationic residue in transmembrane domain 3, consistent with
greater antagonism. The interaction distances for 1a and 1b with
LPA2 are essentially identical, consistent with equivalent potencies.
Whereas both compounds show similar phosphate basic residue
distances in LPA3, the partially negative bromine atom of 1b is only
2.5 Å from K95. In contrast, the bromine atoms in the other five
complexes are >3.5 Å from the basic residues, consistent with the
more potent antagonism of 1b compared with 1a.

LPA Signaling Antagonist Inhibits Metastatic Phenotype

Unique LPA antagonists. To our knowledge, this constitutes
the first comprehensive pharmacologic assessment of novel
analogues of LPA on five LPA GPCRs from two families. Notably,
diastereomer 1b is the first known pan-antagonist, blocking LPA
activation at LPA1-5. This represents a proof of concept that
compounds capable of inhibiting both the edg family of LPA
receptors (LPA1-3) and the purinergic family of LPA receptors
represented by LPA4 and LPA5 exist.
BrP-LPA diastereomers differentially inhibit ATX and cell
migration. LPA is produced from LPC by ATX/lysoPLD (17, 18, 41),
and local production of LPA can support invasion of tumor cells,
promoting metastasis (4, 19, 42) via several molecular mechanisms.
First, activation of the Rho and Rac GTPase pathways downstream
from LPA-GPCRs regulates actin cytoskeleton and cell motility (43).
Second, LPA modulates the activity of matrix metalloproteinases,
which are crucial for metastasis and LPA-induced transphosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (44). Third, the
potent motogenic effects of ATX are lead to enhanced angiogenesis
(45). Thus, LPA receptor antagonists and ATX inhibitors have
potential in cancer therapy both by blocking the growthsupporting, angiogenic, and antiapoptotic effects of LPA and by
reducing its titer (42, 46).
Addition of BrP-LPA diastereomers 1a and 1b at 40 Amol/L both
significantly decreased migration of MDA-MB-231 cells into a
scratched monolayer. The more potent ATX inhibitor anti-BrP-LPA
1b showed greater potency in reducing cell migration, although the
isomers were equipotent in decreasing the cell invasion through
Matrigel-coated transwell membranes.

BrP-LPA diastereomers cause tumor regression and reduced
angiogenesis. Finally, the BrP-LPA diastereomers were evaluated
in a xenograft model using engineered orthotopic breast tumors in
nude mice (22, 23). This new model has potential for creating
vascularized, orthotopic tumors from patient-derived samples and
offers a method to introduce labeled metastatic cells into any
organ (47). We first used the mixed diastereomers 1 to compare
buffer injection with 10 mg/kg i.p. doses, BrP-LPA alone ( four
doses), Taxol alone ( four doses), and Taxol (two doses) followed by
BrP-LPA (two doses). The tumors in all treatment groups were
significantly decreased. Interestingly, quantification of the newly
generated blood vessels in the tumor samples showed highly
significant reduction of angiogenesis in the mice treated with BrPLPA 1 relative to either the controls or Taxol treatments (P < 0.01).
To rationalize this observation that the Taxol followed by BrP-LPA
has the same effect as Taxol alone, we note that Taxol is a mitotic
poison, whereas BrP-LPA inhibits signaling pathways important for
proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis; this compound likely
requires actively dividing cells to exert its effect. Apparently, in
tumors with cells in a growth arrested/apoptotic state, no
additional effect of the BrP-LPA was possible.
This result is extremely encouraging in view of the requirement
for ATX in blood vessel formation during embryogenesis (48) and
the growing potential of antiangiogenic drugs, e.g., Avastin, in
cancer therapy. In addition, each diastereomer significantly
decreased the tumor volume relative to the control group (P <
0.01) at 3 mg/kg. However, with six mice per group, only a trend
was evident to suggest that anti-BrP-LPA 1b might be more

were statistically different from the control (P < 0.05) but not different from each other. Treatment with BrP-LPA 1 alone showed significantly lower blood vessel
density (**) than the controls (P < 0.001) or either Taxol treatment (P < 0.05).

higher efficacy relative to syn-BrP-LPA 1a (P < 0.1). The
mechanistic basis for the antiangiogenic effects of the BrP-LPA
isomers are the subject of active studies with other tumor cells
and other matrices.
Therapeutic potential of ATX inhibitors and LPA antagonists in cancer treatment. LPA GPCRs and ATX present two
promising, druggable, yet underexploited targets for cancer therapy
(5, 6). ATX, a potent motogen in metastatic cancers (19) produces a
continuous output of LPA (17, 18), potentially abrogating the action
of an LPA antagonist. By blocking ATX, the autocrine/paracrine
loop that involves the ATX-mediated production of LPA is reduced
(42, 46). Although ATX is product feedback inhibited (21), using
LPA to inhibit ATX would be counterproductive. Thus, analogues of
LPA that retained ATX inhibitory activity, yet did not activate LPA
GPCRs, are needed. Recently, a structure-function study of
carbacyclic analogues of cyclophosphatidic acid (ccPA) showed
that these compounds were selective inhibitors of ATX and lacked
agonist activity for LPA1,2,3 (38). Importantly, ccPA inhibited cancer
cell invasion in vitro and suppressed metastasis of melanoma cells
in vivo. However, ATX inhibition alone was inadequate to
accomplish both dampen LPA production and suppress receptor
activation by endogenous LPA. In a separate study, different smallmolecule ATX inhibitors were found to reduce melanoma cell
migration in vitro (39).

In conclusion, we established that stereoisomers of BrP-LPA, in
particular anti-BrP-LPA 1b, simultaneously inhibited ATX and
antagonized five of the known LPA GPCRs in vitro. Moreover, we
established in vivo efficacy of the targeted polypharmacology (49)
concept for the LPA pathway by showing the regression and
reduction of angiogenesis in tumor xenografts. Taken together,
these data provide the first proof of concept for the use of a dualfunction pan-LPA receptor antagonist and ATX inhibitor in cancer
chemotherapy.
