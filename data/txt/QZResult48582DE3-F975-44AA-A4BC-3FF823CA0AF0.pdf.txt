ABSTRACT
Increased glucose metabolism is now recognized as an emerging hallmark of
cancer. Recent studies have shown that glucose metabolism is even more active
in cancer stem cells (CSCs), a rare population of cancer cells with the capacity to
self-renew and initiate tumors, and that CSCs are dependent on glycolysis for their
survival/growth. However, the role of glucose metabolism in the control of their selfrenewal and tumor-initiating capacity per se still remains obscure. Moreover, much
remains unknown as to which of the numerous molecules involved in the glucose
metabolism is suitable as a target to control CSCs. Here we demonstrate that the
facilitative glucose transporter GLUT1 is essential for the maintenance of pancreatic,
ovarian, and glioblastoma CSCs. Notably, we found that WZB117, a specific GLUT1
inhibitor, could inhibit the self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity of the CSCs
without compromising their proliferative potential in vitro. In vivo, systemic WZB117
administration inhibited tumor initiation after implantation of CSCs without causing
significant adverse events in host animals. Our findings indicate GLUT1-dependent
glucose metabolism has a pivotal role not only in the growth and survival of CSCs but
also in the maintenance of their stemness and suggest GLUT1 as a promising target
for CSC-directed cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

perpetrate tumor recurrence, and elimination of CSCs,
either functional (inducing differentiation of CSCs into
non-stem cancer cells) or physical (inducing cell death
of CSCs), is therefore expected to be key to curative
treatment of cancer [7, 8].
It has long been recognized that increased
glucose uptake associated with increased glycolysis is a
characteristic feature of cancer cells, and this propensity
of cancer cells to actively take up and metabolize glucose
has formed the basis for fluorodeoxyglucose imaging
as a highly useful cancer detection method [9-11]. The
role and significance of increased glucose metabolism in

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subpopulation
of cancer cells having the capacity to self-renew as well as
the capacity to initiate and recapitulate tumors from which
they are derived [1, 2]. Compared to non-stem cancer cells
that account for the majority of tumor cells comprising a
tumor, CSCs are often refractory to conventional chemoand radiotherapies and can survive even treatments that
would eradicate non-stem cancer cells, causing tumor
recurrence after seemingly successful cancer treatments
[3-6]. As such, CSCs are now deemed as ringleaders that

cancer cell biology, therefore, has been a focus of intense
research. To date, accumulating evidence suggests that
such alterations in the glucose metabolism of cancer cells
may contribute to their proliferation, survival, metastasis,
and therapy resistance [12-16]. However, since studies
have been conducted essentially using non-stem cancer
cells, the role of glucose metabolism in the control of
CSCs has been scarcely investigated and thus remains
largely unknown.
Recently, we discovered that lowering the
extracellular glucose concentration remarkably enhances
the ability of metformin, an anti-diabetic agent, to
differentiate glioma stem cells (GSCs) into non-stem
glioma cells [17], which suggested the possibility that
cellular glucose metabolism driven by concentrationdependent glucose uptake may have a role in the
maintenance of the stem cell status of GSCs. Given
that glucose is transported via two classes of hexose
transporters, namely, the SGLT (sodium-dependent
glucose transporter) family and the GLUT (facilitative
glucose transporter) family, and that SGLTs transport
glucose against the concentration gradient whereas GLUTs
do so along the gradient [18], our earlier observation may
suggest that GLUTs are involved in the control of GSCs.
Here in this study, we therefore explored the
possibility that GLUTs are involved in the control of CSCs
from different cancer types including GSCs. Among the 14
members of mammalian GLUTs, we focused on GLUT1,
which is reportedly expressed abundantly in cancer cells
[18-21]. Our results indicate that GLUT1 expression
and activity is essential for the maintenance of the selfrenewal and tumor-initiating capacity of CSCs, suggesting
that CSC maintenance may be among the critical roles of
increased glucose metabolism of cancer cells and that
GLUT1 could be a promising molecular target in CSCdirected cancer therapies.

being cultured in the low-glucose medium for 1 week,
we found that the expression of stem cell markers such
as Sox2, Bmi1, and Nanog (Figure 1 A), as well as the
surface expression of CD133 (Figure 1 B), was reduced
in all 3 types of CSCs. To determine whether the loss
of the stem cell marker expression actually reflected
loss of stemness associated with differentiation, we
examined the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), an astrocytic differentiation marker, in GS-Y03.
GFAP expression was induced when GS-Y03 cells were
cultured in the presence of 5 mM glucose for 1 week,
which suggested that the cells had undergone astrocytic
differentiation in the low-glucose culture condition
(Figure 1 A). Thus, the results suggested that, at least in
the in vitro stem cell culture condition used in this study,
CSCs may not be able to maintain their stem cell state at
a physiological glucose concentration and may therefore
require supra-physiological concentrations of glucose for
their maintenance.

Pharmacological inhibition of GLUT1 inhibits the
self-renewal capacity of CSCs
Since the CSCs examined in this study were
thus highly dependent on the extracellular glucose
concentration for their maintenance, we surmised that
glucose metabolism may have a role in the maintenance
of their self-renewal capacity and that facilitative glucose
transporters (GLUTs), which facilitate the energyindependent diffusion of glucose across the cell membrane
down the glucose concentration gradient, may be involved
in their glucose uptake, which is a prerequisite for the
initiation of intracellular glucose metabolism. To test these
ideas and examine the possible role of GLUT1 in CSCs,
we first took advantage of a specific pharmacological
inhibitor of GLUT1, WZB117 [22]. Because we wished
to examine the effect of WZB117 specifically on the selfrenewal capacity (i.e., not on the viability) of CSCs, we
determined the non-toxic concentrations of WZB117
for each CSC. We then treated PANC-1 CSLCs, A2780
CSCs, and GS-Y03 cells with WZB117 at their respective
non-toxic concentrations for 6 days, after which the
cells were examined for stem cell and differentiation
marker expression. The results indicated that WZB117
inhibited and induced the expression of the stem cell and
differentiation markers, respectively, in a concentrationdependent manner in the CSCs examined (Figure 2 A,
B). Under the experimental conditions used in this study,
we confirmed that the glucose uptake of the CSCs was
reduced by the WZB117 treatment (Supplemental Figure
S1) and that their glucose metabolism was accordingly
inhibited as suggested by the activation of a cellular energy
sensor AMPK upon WZB117 treatment (Supplemental
Figure S2).
Since the results suggested that sublethal

RESULTS
The impact of glucose concentration in the culture
medium on CSCs
In our earlier study, we showed that decreasing
the glucose concentration in the culture medium from
26.2 mM to 17.5 mM remarkably sensitized GSCs to
the differentiation-inducing effect of metformin [17]. To
determine, in this study, the impact of lowering the glucose
concentration in the absence of metformin further down to
the physiological range, we cultured human CSCs from
different cancer types (PANC-1 CSLC, pancreatic cancer;
A2780 CSC, ovarian cancer; GS-Y03, glioblastoma) in the
presence of 5 mM glucose, a concentration which falls
within the normal blood glucose range. When these CSCs
were examined for their stem cell marker expression after

Genetic knockdown of GLUT1 inhibits the selfrenewal capacity of CSCs

impairment of glucose metabolism could inhibit the
self-renewal capacity of the CSCs, we next examined
whether WZB117 inhibits the sphere-forming ability of
the CSCs without compromising their viability. The results
of the sphere formation assay demonstrated that 6-day
pretreatment with WZB117 was sufficient to deprive the
CSCs of their ability to form spheres even in the absence
of WZB117 (Figure 2 C). Most importantly, when the
CSCs were cultured under the monolayer stem cell culture
condition after the identical 6-day WZB117 pretreatment,
we observed no significant differences in growth (i.e., the
numbers of viable and dead cells) between the controltreated and WZB117-treated CSCs (Supplemental Figure
S3). The results imply that WZB117 specifically targets
the sphere-forming ability of the CSCs without impairing
their proliferative potential per se.

The results of the inhibitor experiments suggested
that GLUT1 activity was required for the glucose uptake
as well as for the maintenance of the self-renewal capacity
of the CSCs. To definitively determine the role of GLUT1
in the CSCs, we next conducted GLUT1 knockdown
experiments. Introduction of an siRNA against GLUT1,
but not a non-targeting siRNA or an siRNA against lamin
A/C, resulted in decreased GLUT1 expression (Figure
3A) and glucose uptake (Supplemental Figure S5) of the
CSCs. Under the experimental condition, we confirmed
that the stem cell marker expression was decreased,
whereas the differentiation marker expression was induced
(Figure 3 A, B), in GLUT1 knockdown cells compared

cell and differentiation markers by immunoblot analysis (A) and for the cell surface expression of CD133 by flow cytometry (B). In (B),

to the control cells, which was reproduced using another
siRNA against GLUT1 (Supplemental Figure S4). In the
sphere formation assay, GLUT1 knockdown cells formed
spheres significantly less efficiently than the control cells
(Figure 3 C). These results, in conjunction with those of
the pharmacological inhibitor experiments, suggest that
GLUT1 plays an essential role in the maintenance of
the glucose metabolism and self-renewal capacity of the
CSCs.

Along with self-renewal capacity, tumor-initiating
capacity is another key essential property intrinsic to
CSCs. Given the critical role of GLUT1 in the maintenance
of the self-renewal capacity of the CSCs, we next asked

if we could inhibit, similarly to the self-renewal capacity,
the tumor-initiating capacity of the CSCs by targeting
GLUT1 in vitro, and from a therapeutic point of view, in
vivo as well. To rigorously test this point, we chose for
the following experiments PANC-1 CSLCs, which was the
most resistant to GLUT1 inhibition among the three CSCs,

i.e., requiring the highest concentration of WZB117 for
inhibition of self-renewal capacity and cell viability. To
determine first whether targeting GLUT1 with WZB117
inhibits the tumor-initiating capacity of PANC-1 CSLCs,
we examined, after pretreatment with WZB117 in vitro,
their ability to initiate tumors upon xenotransplantation

into nude mice. PANC-1 CSLCs were treated with
WZB117 at 10 µM for 6 days, a condition which did not
significantly inhibit their viability and monolayer growth
after washout of the inhibitor (Supplemental Figure S3).
When the cells were then implanted into nude mice, tumor
formation by the WZB117-treated cells was significantly
inhibited compared to the control-treated cells, indicating
that WZB117 can selectively target the tumor-initiating
capacity of PANC-1 CSLCs in vitro without compromising
their viability and proliferative potential (Figure 4 A).
We then went on to ask whether WZB117 could inhibit
tumor initiation by PANC-1 CSLCs in vivo. To address
this question, we implanted PANC-1 CSLCs into nude
mice, and on the next day of implantation, started
systemic administration of WZB117 for 10 consecutive
days, after which the mice were monitored without
further administration of the drug. The results indicated
that WZB 117 inhibited the tumor-initiating capacity of
PANC-1 CSLCs also in vivo, with the inhibitory effect
of systemic WZB117 administration on tumor initiation
being more pronounced than that of reducing the number
of implanted cells by 2.5-fold (Figure 4 B). We also
confirmed that the protocol of WZB117 treatment used
in this study (20 mg/kg/day for 10 consecutive days) was
well tolerated by nude mice and did not affect their general
health status for at least 5 months (Supplemental Figure
S6). Finally, to determine whether, in vivo, WZB117
inhibits tumor initiation selectively or tumor growth in
general, we examined the effect of systemic administration
of WZB117 on pre-established tumors. We implanted
PANC-1 CSLCs into nude mice and allowed them to
grow to form tumors. When the tumors reached the size
of ~ 600 mm3, we started systemic administration of
WZB117 to the host mice with exactly the same protocol
that effectively inhibited tumor initiation by PANC-1
CSLCs as described above. Strikingly, the protocol had
no discernible inhibitory effect on the growth of the preestablished tumors, in support of the idea that WZB117

selectively targets CSCs at least in our experimental
conditions (Figure 4 C).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the possible
involvement of GLUT1, a member of the facilitative
glucose transporter (GLUT) family, in the control of the
self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity of CSCs. Our
results showed that both pharmacological and genetic
inhibition of GLUT1 in CSCs could cause decreased
stem cell marker expression, induction of differentiation
marker expression, and loss of sphere-forming ability
without compromising the viability of CSCs, which was

confirmed in CSCs from three different types of human
cancer. Consistent with such an essential role of GLUT1
in the maintenance of self-renewal capacity of CSCs,
transient inhibition of GLUT1 prevented CSCs from
initiating tumors, underscoring its role in the maintenance
of the tumor-initiating capacity of CSCs. Thus, the
results suggest that GLUT1 may play a key role in the
maintenance of the self-renewal and tumor-initiating
capacity of CSCs. Although we cannot formally exclude
the possibility that GLUT1 contributes to the maintenance
of CSCs through an as yet unknown function(s) other than
glucose transport, our results might also imply that the
increased glycolytic metabolism characteristically seen
in human cancers has a pivotal role in the maintenance
of CSCs in different, albeit not all, human cancer types.
Importantly, inhibition of GLUT1 in vivo through
systemic administration of WZB117 inhibited tumor
initiation by CSCs, suggesting that GLUT1 may be a
promising candidate as a target for CSC-directed cancer
therapy. Notably, although the same protocol of systemic
WZB117 administration failed to inhibit the growth of
pre-established tumors, we meanwhile found that the
proportion of CD133-positive cells in WZB117-treated
tumors was smaller compared to control treated tumors
(Supplemental Figure S7). Together, these results appear
to suggest that, in vivo, CSCs might be more sensitive to
GLUT1 inhibition than non-stem cancer cells and that
WZB117 may selectively target CSCs at least in our
experimental condition.
It has long been recognized that cancer cells in
general show increased glycolytic activity, and recent
evidence suggests that CSCs may have even more
increased glycolytic activity compared to non-stem cancer
cells [10, 23-26]. However, the role and significance
of this propensity of CSCs toward highly glycolytic
metabolism remain largely unknown. Recent studies
have shown that 3-bromopyruvate, a hexokinase 2 (HK2)
inhibitor, and its derivatives (pentyl 3-bromopyruvate
ester [P-BrPE] and 3-bromo-2-oxopropionate-1-propyl
ester [3-BrOP]) reduce the viability of CSCs and that
knockdown of GLUT3 inhibits the growth of brain tumor
CSCs [23, 25-28]. While all these studies do indicate that
the glycolytic metabolism plays an essential role in the
survival and proliferation of CSCs, it still remains to be
shown whether the glycolytic metabolism has a role in the
maintenance of the self-renewal capacity of CSCs. Here
in the present study, we have provided for the first time
evidence to support the idea that the active glycolytic
metabolism characteristic of CSCs plays an essential role
not only in their survival and proliferation but also in
the maintenance of the self-renewal and tumor-initiating
capacity of CSCs. Given the role of glycolysis as a critical
cellular process required for energy production and
macromolecular synthesis [10, 29], it is quite natural that
inhibition of glycolysis leads to reduced cellular viability
and proliferation. On the other hand, the mechanism by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which glycolysis contributes to the maintenance of CSC
self-renewal remains rather enigmatic. One intriguing
possibility is that glycolysis has a role in the regulation
of redox status of CSCs [30], which, as we have recently
demonstrated, is a key determinant of CSC fate [31].
Whether or not glycolysis controls the stemness of CSCs
via redox regulation, the mechanism by which glycolysis
controls the stemness of CSCs will be an important issue
of future investigation.
The findings of this study are of substantial
significance also from a therapeutic perspective. One
of the most critical problems inherently associated with
targeting glycolysis for cancer therapy is that glycolysis is
commonly utilized by cells in general as a major source of
energy and macromolecule supply irrespective of whether
they are neoplastic or not [10, 29]. So, it is highly desired
that, when targeting glycolysis for cancer therapy, we find
out such target molecules that cancer cells specifically
require to maintain their functional integrity. In this regard,
GLUT1 is an attractive candidate as a target molecule,
since GLUT1 is expressed preferentially in cancer cells
[18-21]. Importantly, the concentrations of WZB117
required for the inhibition of the self-renewal and tumorinitiating capacity of the CSCs were apparently lower than
those required to reduce their viability, which will help
create an even larger therapeutic window. Indeed, in the
xenograft analyses of the present study, tumor initiation
by PANC-1 CSLCs was successfully inhibited by systemic
WZB117 treatment, which neither caused adverse events
nor inhibited bulk tumor growth. Thus, the results clearly
indicate that GLUT1 is a promising molecular target
for CSC-directed cancer therapy. Similarly to GLUT1,
GLUT3 is another promising target to control the
glycolytic metabolism of CSCs [27]. To date, the effects
of specific GLUT3 inhibitors on CSCs and on normal cells
or individuals have yet to be reported and therefore remain
unknown. However, given the possible role of GLUT3 in
various human cancer types [27], GLUT3 may remain
a strong candidate as a target for CSC-directed therapy.
HK2 is another molecule of interest in this regard, since
HK2 has been shown to be specifically required for tumor
initiation and maintenance in mouse models of cancer
while being dispensable in adult mice without causing
an overt phenotype [32]. In accordance with such a
report, BrPE and BrOP, though they may not necessarily
be specific inhibitors of HK2 [33], have been shown to
reduce the viability of CSCs in vitro [23, 25, 26]. In vivo,
the cancer therapeutic effects of these inhibitors have been
demonstrated alone or in combination with conventional
chemotherapeutic agents [23, 25, 26]. Because of the
limited number of relevant studies, it still remains to be
determined which molecule(s) in the glycolytic pathway
is superior to another as a therapeutic target. Nevertheless,
all relevant studies including ours at least unanimously
indicate that the glycolytic pathway is a viable target in
CSC-directed cancer therapy.

In conclusion, we have provided evidence that
the active glucose transport of CSCs has a role in the
maintenance of their self-renewal and tumor-initiating
capacity and is therefore an attractive target of CSCdirected therapy. We have also demonstrated that GLUT1
is a promising molecular target to specifically control
CSCs in vivo. In combination with other therapeutic
modalities that effectively control the tumor bulk, glucose
metabolism-targeted therapy through GLUT1 inhibition is
expected to help achieve better management of cancers
through prevention of fatal recurrence.

Flow cytometric analysis

The establishment of the human CSCs used in this
study (GS-Y03, PANC-1 CSLC, and A2780 CSC) has been
described [17, 34, 35]. These cell lines were maintained
under the monolayer stem cell culture condition reported
previously [17, 34, 35]. In brief, cells were cultured on
collagen-I-coated dishes (IWAKI, Tokyo, Japan) in
the stem cell culture medium (DMEM/F12 medium
supplemented with 1% B27 [Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, CA,
USA], 20 ng/mL EGF and FGF2 [Peprotech, Inc., Rocky
Hill, NJ, USA], D-(+)-glucose [final concentration, 26.2
mM or 5 mM where indicated as such], L-glutamine [final
concentration, 4.5 mM], 100 units/mL penicillin and 100
μg/mL streptomycin). In principle, the stem cell culture
medium was changed every 3 days, and EGF and FGF2
were added to the culture medium every day. Throughout
the study, the cell number was determined using a
hemocytometer, and the cell viability was examined by the
dye exclusion method (0.2% trypan blue). Cell viability
(%) was defined as 100 x ‘the number of viable cells’/
(‘the number of viable cells’ + ‘the number of dead cells’).

Dissociated cells were washed with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT),
and washed again with PBS. The cells were then blocked
in FACS buffer (0.5% [w/v] bovine serum albumin, 0.1%
[w/v] NaN3 in PBS) for 30 min, followed by 3 PBS rinses
and subsequently by incubation with the anti-CD133
antibody in the FACS buffer for 1 h and then with the
Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG for another 30
min at RT. Gating for single cells was established using
forward scatter in the isotype control samples. The isotype
control samples were used to establish a gate in the
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) channel. Cells showing
signal for CD133 above the gate established by the isotype
control were deemed CD133-positive. All flow cytometric
experiments were run on FACSCantoTM II Flow Cytometer
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the data
were analyzed using FlowJo software, version 7.6.5
(Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).

After being dissociated into single cells, PANC1 CSLCs, A2780 CSCs, and GS-Y03 cells were serially
diluted in the stem cell culture medium and seeded into
non-coated 96-well plates so that there be a single cell in
each well. Wells containing a single cell were marked on
the next day and, 1 week after seeding, the percentage of
marked wells with a sphere relative to the total number of
marked wells was determined.

in a dissociation enzyme solution (20 mM HEPES-PBS
[pH7.4] containing 0.02% DNase I [Sigma, A4572] and
0.02% collagenase II [Sigma, C6885]) for 30 min at 37
°C. After being rinsed with DMEM/F12, dissociated
tumor cells were re-suspended in DMEM/F12 and filtered
through a 70-μm strainer. The dissociated cells were then
fixed and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. All animal
experiments were performed under a protocol approved by
the Animal Research Committee of Yamagata University.

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as means and standard
deviation (SD), and differences were compared using the
2-tailed Student’s t-test. P-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant and indicated with asterisks in the
figures.

Glucose-uptake assay
The glucose-uptake assay was done essentially as
described [36]. In brief, cells were treated with 1 mM
2-deoxyglucose (2DG) for 20 min at 37°C 5% CO2. The
reaction was stopped by harvesting the cells and washing
them with ice-cold PBS three times. The cell pellet was
solubilized in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4) by sonication
(UH-50, SMT CO., LTD, Tokyo, JAPAN), followed by
determination of the amount of 2DG using 2DG Uptake
Measurement Kit (OKP-PMG-K01T, COSMO BIO Co.,
LTD, Tokyo, JAPAN), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Glucose uptake (pg/min/cell) was calculated
as the amount of 2DG (pg) transported per cell per minute.

ACKNOWLEGEMENTS

study, respectively. This work was supported by Grants-inAid for Scientific Research, for Challenging Exploratory
Research, and for Young Scientists from the Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of
Japan, by a Grant-in-Aid from the Global COE Program
of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, by
the National Cancer Center Research and Development
Fund (23-A-20), and by a grant from the Japan Brain
Foundation.

Mouse studies
Mouse xenograft studies were carried out
essentially as previously described [34]. For subcutaneous
implantation, 5- to 8-week-old male BALB/ cAJcl-nu/nu
mice (Clea Japan, Inc.) were, after being anesthetized
with avertin (0.375 g/kg intraperitoneally), implanted
subcutaneously in the flank region with cells suspended
in 200 μL of PBS. After implantation, the recipient
mice were monitored for general health status and the
presence of subcutaneous tumors. Tumor volume was
determined by measuring tumor diameters (measurement
of 2 perpendicular axes of tumors) using a caliper and
calculated as 1/2 x (larger diameter) x (smaller diameter)2.
For systemic administration of WZB117, the WZB117
stock solution (4 mg/mL in dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO])
was diluted in PBS to prepare 200 μL solutions of
WZB117 for each injection. The WZB117 solutions
were injected intraperitoneally into nude mice. Note
that all the control- and WZB117-treated mice received
an equal volume of DMSO per body weight (3.6 mL/
