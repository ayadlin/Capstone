BACKGROUND: Bortezomib has demonstrated efficacy in patients with relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL) both alone and in combination with other agents; however, limited data exist regarding its toxicity in combination with common frontline therapies for indolent NHL. A phase 1 study of bortezomib combined with rituximab,
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, modified vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) was conducted in patients with
untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) and other indolent NHLs. METHODS: Nineteen patients, including 10 patients
with FL, were enrolled. The median patient age was 59 years (range, 29-71 years). Seven patients had a FL International Prognostic Index score 3. R-CHOP with the vincristine dose capped at 1.5 mg was administered on a 21-day
cycle for 6 to 8 cycles, and 1 of 3 dose levels of bortezomib (1.0 mg/m2 [n ¼ 1], 1.3 mg/m2 [n ¼ 6], or 1.6 mg/m2 [n ¼
12]) was administered on days 1 and 8 of each cycle using a Bayesian algorithm for dose escalation. RESULTS: The
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib with modified R-CHOP was reached at 1.6 mg/m2. Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 5 patients (1 patient at a bortezomib dose of 1.0 mg/m2, 1 patient at a bortezomib dose of 1.3
mg/m2, and 3 patients at a bortezomib dose of 1.6 mg/m2). Neuropathy occurred in 16 patients (84%), including 2
patients (11%) who experienced grade 3 sensory neuropathy. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 4 patients. Of
19 evaluable patients, 100% responded, and the complete response rate was 68%. At a median follow-up of 32
months, the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 89.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib combined with modified RCHOP produced high response rates without substantial increases in toxicity. A phase 2 study of R-CHOP and borteC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas
(NHL) comprise approximately 25% of all new NHL
cases, and follicular lymphoma (FL) represents 75% of indolent NHLs. The majority of patients with indolent
NHL present with advanced stage disease and require
treatment. Although current treatment strategies with
chemoimmunotherapy are associated with higher
response rates and longer remission durations,1-5 historically, the clinical course of these lymphomas with standard treatments is characterized by multiple relapses and a
median survival of 6.2 years.6,7 Common initial management options include radiation therapy, single agents, and
combination chemoimmunotherapy, but no clear standard of care has been established for first-line therapy.8
Although the addition of rituximab (R) to chemotherapy improves survival for patients with B-cell lymphomas,2,3,6,9,10 patients still relapse after receiving R
chemotherapy regimens. Some studies suggest that
achieving completed remission (CR) and eradication of
FL and possibly other forms of indolent NHL may be a
key to the development of strategies aimed at cure.9,11,12
An initial step toward this end involves developing firstline treatment strategies with improved complete and molecular response rates. Our meta-analysis of frontline
therapies for FL demonstrated that R plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (RCHOP) has a very high CR rate,5 and other data have
indicated that it is the most commonly used first-line
regimen for FL in the United States,8 making R-CHOP
suitable as a backbone for a novel treatment approach.
One mechanism by which lymphoma cells become
resistant to R and chemotherapy is through hyperactivation of the nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB) pathway, leading to
overexpression of the long, alternatively spliced variant of
bcl-x, B-cell lymphoma-extra large (bcl-XL).13,14 Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with antitumor activity in
B-cell malignancies that produces responses in patients
with relapsed FL either alone15 or combined with R16 and
can overcome Bcl-XL-mediated R and chemotherapy resistance in vitro.13 These data suggest that adding bortezomib to R-CHOP could produce a therapy that may
maximize response rates in the frontline setting and provide a platform for establishing long-term disease-free survival with maintenance therapy.17-19
Bortezomib has been combined safely with R in the
treatment of relapsed FL, demonstrating equal efficacy
and less toxicity when given on a weekly basis compared
with a twice-weekly schedule.16 Neurotoxicity has been of

particular concern when combining bortezomib with vincristine. Peripheral neuropathy rates have been as high as
65% in some reported studies when combining bortezomib with R-CHOP for aggressive lymphomas.17,19 Furman and colleagues reported a 65% rate of peripheral
neuropathy in a phase 1 trial using full-dose R-CHOP
with 1 of 3 dose levels of bortezomib (0.7 mg/m2, 1.0 mg/
m2, and 1.3 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 4 of each
cycle.17 Grade 3 neuropathy was observed at the 1.0 mg/
m2 dose level. Ruan and colleagues confirmed those findings, describing neuropathy in 64% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mantle cell
lymphoma with additional follow-up from an extension
of this trial.19 Given the concerns for higher rates of neuropathy when combining these 2 drugs with overlapping
toxicities, additional monitoring of neurologic events is
needed for such trials. Neurotoxicity-directed questionnaires can be useful tools for determining the presence
and intensity of neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy from the patient’s perspective. For this reason, we
incorporated a neurotoxicity questionnaire into our study
to capture signs and symptoms of neuropathy and performed electrophysiologic testing to help identify markers
of chemotherapy-induced nerve damage. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use an escalating schema for
both bortezomib and vincristine to treat patients with indolent NHL and to evaluate the incidence and severity of
neuropathy in this manner.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients who satisfied all the following criteria were enrolled into the study: 1) histologically confirmed diagnosis
of a previously untreated FL (grade 1, 2, 3a, or 3b), small
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), marginal zone lymphoma
(MZL), or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma; 2) an
indication for treatment based on modified French Follicular Lymphoma Study Group criteria20 or a Follicular
Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score 321; 3)
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2; 4) aged 18 years at the time of
registration; 5) at least 1 measurable tumor mass (>1.5
cm in greatest dimension and >1.0 cm in the short axis)
on a computed tomography (CT) scan or physical examination; 6) adequate renal function demonstrated by a serum creatinine level <1.5 mg/dL; 7) alanine and aspartate
aminotransferase levels 3.5 the upper limit of normal
and a total bilirubin level 2.0 mg/dL unless secondary to
lymphoma; 8) cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction

50%; and 10) no previous treatment of the disease other
than external-beam radiation (2 sites of therapy) or steroids (<2 months of therapy). Patients with any other
malignancies within the past 5 years except basal carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix were
excluded from the study. Patients were excluded for pregnancy, central nervous system lymphoma, hypersensitivity
to boron or mannitol, human immunodeficiency virus, or
active hepatitis B or C. All patients provided voluntary,
written, informed consent and authorization according to
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
before the performance of any study-related procedures.
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board before the study was initiated.
Pretreatment Study Evaluation
Pretreatment evaluations included a physical examination; concomitant medication assessment; high-resolution
CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis (alone
or in combination with positron emission tomography
[PET] studies); and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
In addition, blood was drawn for serum chemistry
analysis, a complete blood count, measurement of serum
b2-microglobulin, human immunodeficiency virus antibody, and hepatitis panel.
Chemotherapy Regimen and Supportive Care
The primary objective was to determine the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity profile of bortezomib
(Velcade; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge,
Mass) administered in combinations with R-CHOP (VRCHOP) to patients with untreated FL and indolent
NHL. Secondary objectives included assessment of the
overall response (OR) and complete Response (CR) rates,
progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
Because this study also incorporated maintenance strategies, another objective was to estimate the conversion to
CR rate associated with maintenance R plus bortezomib
after VR-CHOP and to assess the tolerance of maintenance R in combination with bortezomib, which will be
evaluated in the phase 2 portion of this study.
Six to 8 cycles of therapy administered every 21 days
were planned, and the total number of cycles was determined by the treating physician. Because our inclusion
criteria allowed for the treatment of grade 3b FL and previous trials in low-grade lymphoma reported on the feasibility of delivering up to 8 cycles of R with
chemotherapy,22 patients were able to receive a total of 8

cycles of chemotherapy. We wanted to examine the safety
of bortezomib in combination given up to 8 cycles.
Standard premedications consisted of intravenous
ondansetron 8 mg plus prednisone 100 mg orally (on day 1
of 5 for prednisone) for nausea and diphenhydramine 50
mg orally plus acetaminophen 650 mg orally for the prevention of hypersensitivity reaction to R. Bortezomib was
administered by intravenous push on day 1 and was
repeated on day 8 of each cycle. On day 1, bortezomib
administration was followed by R. R infusion was followed
by doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 administered intravenously over
3 to 5 minutes followed by intravenous cyclophosphamide
750 mg/m2 and vincristine capped at 1.5 mg. Table 1 provides the dose-finding schema with titration of bortezomib
and vincristine. No other drugs were titrated. White blood
cell growth factor support was not allowed for any patient
during cycle 1 to permit the assessment of hematologic toxicity in establishing the MTD. Maintenance therapy was
explored for all patients. Maintenance therapy was started 3
months after the completion of induction therapy (Fig. 1).
For patients who achieved CR, R 375 mg/m2 was administered every 12 weeks until progressive disease (PD) or 2
years of therapy. For patients who achieved stable disease or
PR, R 375 mg/m2 along with bortezomib 1.6 mg/m2 was
administered weekly for 4 doses every 6 months until PD
or 2 years of completed maintenance. The data reported
in this article focus on the results from patients who were
treated during the induction phase. The results from the
maintenance strategy will be reported in an analysis of the
phase 2 portion of this study.

Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 3.0. Patients had a
complete blood count with differential and platelet count
performed on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. A cycle of chemotherapy could be held for up to 2 weeks until the patient
had a platelet count >100  109/L and an absolute neutrophil count of >1.0  109/L. Before each cycle, the patient
had a complete history and physical examination, including a detailed neurologic evaluation using the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology
Group (FACT/GOG)-Neurotoxicity questionnaire.
The FACT/GOG patient self-assessment questionnaire includes 11 questions that assess the severity and
impact of neuropathy symptoms.23 It is comprised of
questions regarding sensory symptoms (numbness and
discomfort in hands and feet, difficulty feeling the shape
of objects), motor symptoms (general weakness, trouble
walking, trouble buttoning buttons, joint pain/muscle
cramps), and auditory problems (difficulty hearing, buzzing/ringing in ears). We also used nerve-conduction studies, which involved recording responses from both sensory
nerves and motor nerves. Both the amplitude (size) of the
response and the speed with which an impulse traveled
along the nerve (conduction velocity) were measured.
These parameters were recorded along distal nerve segments. Proximal segments of the nerves were evaluated by
recording the latency of late responses (F-waves and Hreflexes). We also recorded responses from the sural nerves
(bilateral), the radial nerve on 1 side, the peroneal and tibial nerves (with F-responses) on 1 side, and the H-reflexes
(bilaterally). These electromyography/nerve conduction
velocity (EMG/NCV) studies were performed at baseline
and after cycle 4.24 The FACT/GOG questionnaire and
EMG/NCV testing were additional assessments of

neuropathy but were not incorporated formally into the
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment. DLT assessment
was based solely on NCI CTCAE coding.
CT scans were performed after every 2 cycles during
the induction phase and then every 3 months during
maintenance. Additional PET images were obtained in
selected patients at follow-up at the discretion of the treating physician, but insufficient data are available to evaluate the usefulness of PET studies with this regimen in
these lymphoma subtypes. Revised response criteria for
lymphomas were used for the categorization of responses
after completion of induction therapy.25
Statistical Design
The objective of this phase 1 trial was to determine tolerable dose levels for the combination vincristine and bortezomib (with fixed dosing of R, cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, and prednisone). The MTD was defined as
the regimen at which <30% grade 3 nonhematologic
toxicity or grade 4 hematologic toxicity (lasting >14
days) occurred. The dose-escalation scheme followed the
Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC) protocol, a
statistical method that directly incorporates formal safety
constraints into the design of phase 1 cancer trials.26-28
EWOC controls the frequency of over dosage by selecting
dose levels for use in the trial and stipulates that the predicted proportion of patients administered a dose exceeding the MTD equals a specified upper bound (y ¼ 0.3).
This allows more patients to be treated with potentially
therapeutic doses of promising new agents and exposes
fewer patients to the deleterious effects of a toxic dose.
The dose escalation was conducted in 2 stages. In the first
stage, the dose of vincristine was fixed and capped at 1.5

capped at 2 mg produced excessive neurologic toxicity,18
and we updated the EWOC algorithm and probabilities
with these data and stage 1 data. EWOC predicted a posterior median MTD of 1.34 mg/m2 of bortezomib with
vincristine capped at 2 mg (Fig. 2b), which was less than
the dose established in stage 1; thus, vincristine was not
escalated.

RESULTS

Figure 2. Posterior density of the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) for bortezomib is illustrated using escalation with
overdose control (EWOC). (a) In the first stage of the doseescalation schema, the vincristine dose was capped at 1.5 mg,
and the bortezomib dose was escalated from 1.0 mg/m2 to
its MTD. The posterior median MTD of bortezomib was 1.62
mg/m2, and the 95% highest posterior density interval was
0.63 to 1.88 mg/m2. (b) In the second stage of the dose-escalation schema, data from the French Adult Lymphoma Study
Group study18 were incorporated to estimate the MTD of bortezomib if the vincristine dose was capped at 2.0 mg. The
posterior median MTD of bortezomib was 1.34 mg/m2, and
the 95% highest posterior density interval was 0.09 to 1.78
mg/m2.

mg, whereas the dose of bortezomib was escalated from
1.0 mg/m2 to its MTD. After the MTD for bortezomib
was reached, we calculated the 25th percentile of the posterior distribution of the MTD (with the prior distribution for MTD based on the known probabilities of
neuropathy and hematologic toxicity associated with bortezomib and R-CHOP from this study and from other
available data; Fig. 2a).17-19 In the second stage, vincristine escalation was planned according to the EWOC algorithm, and bortezomib was to be held constant at the
previously determined dose from stage 1. Dose escalation
of vincristine was never performed during the execution
of the trial after data were presented indicating that the
combination of 1.6 mg/m2 of bortezomib with vincristine

Patients
Between September 2007 and September 2009, 19
patients were enrolled in phase 1 of the study. All 19
patients completed induction therapy and were assessable
for response and toxicity. The clinical characteristics of
these patients at presentation are listed in Table 2. The
median patient age was 59 years, 58% of patients were
men, and most patients presented with stage IV disease
(63%). FL was the diagnosis in 53% patients; 4 patients
had SLL, 3 patients had MZL, and 2 patients had lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). Patients received an average of 7 cycles
(range, 6-8 cycles) of therapy. One patient received dose
level 0, 6 patients received dose level 1, and 12 patients
received dose level 2.
Toxicity
Hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities are listed in
Table 3. Grade 3 neutropenia was observed in 58% of
patients in the study, whereas grade 3 thrombocytopenia was observed in 1 patient. Five patients experienced
grade 4 neutropenia; however, it did not persist for >14
days in any patient. The most common nonhematologic
toxicities were sensory neuropathy (84%; 13 patients, 1
patient, and 2 patients with grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3
sensory neuropathy, respectively), nausea (13% of
patients), pain (63% of patients), and fatigue (58% of
patients).
Across all dose levels, DLT was observed in 5
patients (1 patient at dose level 0, 1 patient at dose level 1,
and 3 patients at dose level 2). The only patient at dose
level 0 developed grade 4 neutropenia, whereas 1 of 6
patients at dose level 1 developed grade 4 neutropenia. Of
the 12 patients at dose level 2, 1 patient each developed
grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 sensory neuropathy, and
1 patient developed both grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3
sensory neuropathy.
To examine neurotoxicity, we used 3 modalities: the

NCI CTCAE neurotoxicity scores assigned by investigators, and EMG/NCV studies to detect subclinical neurologic deficits. Only the NCI CTCAE neurotoxicity
assessment was used in determining DLT. FACT neurotoxicity questionnaires were completed by 18 patients at
baseline and after cycle 2, by 16 patients after cycle 4, and
by 15 patients after the completion of therapy. After cycle
4, 88% of patients reported little or no neuropathy for
each FACT item. By the end of the treatment, >65% of
patients reported little or no neuropathy for each FACT
item (Fig. 3). The most common neurologic issues
reported on the FACT questionnaire at the end of treatment were numbness in the hands or feet (17%), discomfort in the hands (17%), and discomfort in the feet
(17%). On the basis of EMG/NCV studies, 3 of 18
patients had subclinical sensory or motor deficits at baseline (Table 4). Two patients who had normal baseline
EMG/NCV studies experienced painful sensory neuropathy (grade 3) after the onset of therapy. Two different

patients who had abnormal baseline NCV studies had no
symptoms according to the FACT/GOG questionnaire,
whereas all patients who reported baseline symptoms on
the FACT/GOG had normal NCV studies. Repeat
EMG/NCV studies were conducted in 16 patients after
cycle 4 and demonstrated sensory deficit in 2 patients at
dose level 2, motor deficit in 3 patients (2 patients at dose
level 1, 1 patient at dose level 2), and both sensory and
motor deficit in 1 patient at dose level 1. However, none
of these deficits were associated with neuropathy according to FACT self-reporting or NCI CTCAE neurotoxicity
scores.
Bortezomib was held for a single cycle in 2 patients
with sensory neuropathy, and 1 patient with grade 4 neutropenia had a cycle delayed for 2 weeks because of poor
recovery of neutrophil counts. All other patients completed 6 or 8 cycles as planned.
Efficacy
Among 19 patients across all dose levels, the OR rate at
the end of induction treatment was 100% (CR, 68%; PR,
32%). The diagnosis-specific CR rates were 80% for FL,
25% for SLL, 100% for MZL, and 50% for WM. The
median OS and PFS were not reached. One patient with
stage IV FL who achieved CR after 6 cycles of chemotherapy relapsed within 1 month of completing induction
therapy, had transformation to Burkitt lymphoma with
central nervous system involvement within 7 months, and
subsequently died with PD. Of the remaining 12 patients
who achieved CR, 11 patients remained in CR at last follow-up, and 1 patient with MZL relapsed after 3 years. Of

vincristine dosing did not increase or add significant toxicity to the regimen. The current regimen produced an
OR rate of 100% and a CR rate of 68%, and responses
were observed across indolent NHL subtypes and were
most prominent in FL. One patient at dose level 0
achieved CR, 5 of 6 patients at dose level 1 achieved CR,
and 7 patients at dose level 2 achieved CR. The data suggest that bortezomib at doses up to 1.6 mg/m2 given on
days 1 and 8 with vincristine capped at 1.5 mg can be
safely combined with acceptable toxicity in patients who
have untreated, low-grade lymphomas. The combination
of bortezomib with R-CHOP was well tolerated, and
adverse events were manageable. In particular, neurotoxicity with this regimen was not increased substantially compared with R-CHOP1,29 based on objective assessments
with EMG/NCV studies, subjective investigator evaluations, and patient self-report. After cycle 4, >88% of
patients reported no or very little neuropathy; and, at the
end of therapy, >65% of patients reported little or no
neuropathy for each item on the FACT neurotoxicity
questionnaire. The FACT questionnaire also revealed that
>80% of patients were able to perform tasks of daily living and reported no problems with buttoning, feeling
small objects, and walking. To our knowledge, this is the
first study of neurotoxicity assessments in patients with
lymphoma to incorporate not only CTCAE grading
of neurotoxicity but also patient questionnaires and
nerve-conduction studies to broadly characterize regimenrelated neurotoxicity in patients with NHL. It is noteworthy that baseline EMG/NCV studies did not correlate
with patient self-assessments. The nerve-conduction
studies revealed that both sensory nerve and motor nerve
conduction velocities were affected but that these did not

correlate well with clinical assessments. Thus, combined
modalities of assessment are needed to fully characterize
the neurologic toxicity associated with this regimen and
probably with other cancer therapies. Furthermore, the
EWOC methodology used for dosing illustrates the
advantages of a Bayesian method for dose escalation that
can make use of available data to update probabilities and
reduce the likelihood of exposing patients to regimens
identified with toxicity in other settings.
Novel approaches with combination chemoimmunotherapy appear to have improved OS for patients with
FL over time.6,10 Although R-CHOP has been the most
commonly used first-line regimen in the United States,
other approaches have emerged that may rival or supplant
R-CHOP in the future. Rummel and colleagues presented
data on the use of bendamustine and R in patients with
FL and mantle cell lymphoma and demonstrated that,
whereas the OR rate for patients who received bendamustine-R (93.8%) was similar to the rate for those who
received R-CHOP (93.5%), the CR rate was significantly
higher for the bendamustine-R group (40.1%) compared
with the R-CHOP group (30.8%), and the median PFS
was significantly longer for the bendamustine-R group
(54.8 months) compared with the R-CHOP group (34.8
months).30 Moreover, R-CHOP was associated more frequently with serious adverse events than bendamustine-R.
These data suggest that bendamustine-R may serve as
another useful backbone for the exploration of novel combination therapies. The combination of bortezomibbendamustine-R already has been examined in patients
with relapsed, indolent lymphomas31 and is being examined in a first-line ECOG clinical trial.32
Other studies have investigated the combination of
bortezomib and R-CHOP predominantly in aggressive
lymphoma subtypes. Like our trial, 1 concern in those trials was the neurotoxicity that may develop when using
bortezomib and vincristine in combination. In a phase 1
trial, patients with DLBCL (n ¼ 40) and mantle cell lymphoma (n ¼ 36) received standard-dose R-CHOP on a
21-day schedule for 6 cycles with 1 of 3 dose levels of bortezomib (0.7 mg/m2, 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 4 of each cycle.17,33 The MTD of
bortezomib with R-CHOP was not reached, and the 1.3
mg/m2 dose level had acceptable toxicity. Peripheral neuropathy was observed in 64% of patients. In 69% of
patients, the neuropathy returned to baseline within 6
months after the completion of therapy.33
In another trial of patients with previously untreated
B-cell lymphomas, 49 patients received standard

R-CHOP and were randomized to biweekly or weekly
schedules of bortezomib, with both schedules doseescalated (biweekly up to 1.3 mg.m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and
11 or weekly up to 1.6 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8).18 The
CR/unconfirmed CR rate was 84% for all subtypes
combined. However, those investigators noted that grade
2 and 3 neurotoxicity was more common with higher bortezomib dosing (1.3 mg/m2 biweekly and 1.6 mg/m2
weekly) than with lower dosing (1.0 mg/m2 biweekly and
1.3 mg/m2 weekly). For example, grade 3 neurologic
toxicity increased from 7% (1 of 14 patients) to 27% (4 of
15 patients) in those who received bortezomib on days
1 and 8 of each cycle when the dose was increased from
1.3 mg/m2 to 1.6 mg/m2.
Bortezomib also has been combined with other vincristine-containing and anthracycline-containing regimens. Romaguera colleagues reported on the results from
bortezomib in combination with R plus hyperfractionated
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (R-HyperCVAD) alternating with R plus
methotrexate/cytarabine (R-M/A) in patients with
untreated mantle cell lymphoma. Bortezomib was added
to the R-HyperCVAD combination as a fixed dose of 1.3
mg.m2 on days 2 and 5 and was added to the R-M/A regimen after R in increasing doses of 0.7 mg/m2, 1.0 mg/m2,
and 1.3 mg/m2 in cohorts of 3 patients. Those authors
reported that no significant sensory neuropathy was
observed with this combination, and the low incidence of
neuropathy may have been related to scheduling the combination of bortezomib and vincristine every other cycle
(every 6 weeks).34 In contrast, Kahl and colleagues
presented data on a combination of bortezomib with the
R-HyperCVAD regimen in which patients received bortezomib on days 1 and 4 and vincristine on day 3. This regimen was repeated every 3 weeks. The dose of bortezomib
had to be decreased to 1.3 mg/m2, and vincristine had to
be capped at 1 mg to avoid sensory neuropathy.35
Although our study included only 19 patients,
R-CHOP and bortezomib demonstrated encouraging efficacy in patients with indolent lymphomas. Of 10
patients with FL who received this regimen, 8 patients
achieved CR. In addition, all 3 patients with MZL had
CR after 6 cycles of treatment. The neurotoxicity, hematologic toxicities, and other toxicities were limited when
the vincristine dose was capped at 1.5 mg and bortezomib
was given at the MTD of 1.6 mg/m2. However, data from
other trials suggest that substantial neurotoxicity can
occur when bortezomib 1.6 mg/m2 is given with standard-dose vincristine. On the basis of our Bayesian EWOC

3546

algorithm and the published trials mentioned above, bortezomib can be given safely at 1.6 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8
of R-CHOP when vincristine is capped at 1.5 mg, but it
should be reduced to 1.3 mg/m2 if vincristine is capped at
2 mg. Given the in vitro effects of bortezomib in overcoming R-resistant B-cells and the single-agent activity of bortezomib in relapsed lymphomas, we propose that
maximizing the bortezomib dosing is of greater importance than maximizing vincristine.
At the time that the current trial was designed,
extended schedules of maintenance R had been assessed in
patients with FL after initial treatment with single-agent R
and after chemotherapy alone, and the results demonstrated a substantial impact of R on PFS and suggested an
OS benefit.36-38 However, our trial was designed during
the period before results from the Primary Rituximab and
Maintenance (PRIMA) trial were known and used a
slightly different maintenance strategy than PRIMA38
based on pharmacokinetic studies indicating that, with
maintenance R given every 2 to 3 months, nearly all
patients maintained active R levels.39-42 Data from separate
trials by the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research
(SAKK)40 and by Gordan and colleagues41 suggested that
repeat dosing was needed approximately every 2 to 3
months to maintain a therapeutic level of 25 lg/mL (the
median serum level at 3 months after treatment of responders in the pivotal trial that led to R approval).39 We chose
the more convenient schedule for patients in CR of every 3
months in which less R was given with similar expected
results. In addition, based on the promising results from a
phase 2 trial in patients with relapsed FL,16 a maintenance
schedule was designed to test whether giving bortezomib
with R could produce CRs for patients who achieved PR or
SD after bortezomib plus modified R-CHOP.16,43 The
evaluation of this approach is ongoing and will be assessed
as a secondary endpoint with the completion of the phase 2
trial. On the basis of the safety profile, high response rate,
and early data on PFS, we continue to enroll patients with
untreated FL and MZL in a phase 2 study of R-CHOP and
bortezomib given at the established MTD.
