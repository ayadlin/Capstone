ABSTRACT
Direct co-operation between sensitiser molecules BAD and NOXA in mediating
apoptosis suggests that therapeutic agents which sensitise to BAD may complement
agents which sensitise to NOXA. Dynamic BH3 profiling is a novel methodology that
we have applied to the measurement of complementarity between sensitiser BH3
peptide mimetics and therapeutic agents. Using dynamic BH3 profiling, we show that
the agent TG02, which downregulates MCL-1, sensitises to the BCL-2-inhibitory BADBH3 peptide, whereas the BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199 sensitises to MCL-1 inhibitory
NOXA-BH3 peptide in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. At the concentrations
used, the peptides did not trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation
in their own right, but primed cells to release Cytochrome C in the presence of an
appropriate trigger of a complementary pathway. In KG-1a cells TG02 and ABT-199
synergised to induce apoptosis. In heterogeneous AML patient samples we noted a
range of sensitivities to the two agents. Although some individual samples markedly
favoured one agent or the other, in the group as a whole the combination of TG02
+ ABT-199 was significantly more cytotoxic than either agent individually. We
conclude that dynamic NOXA and BAD BH3 profiling is a sensitive methodology for
investigating molecular pathways of drug action and complementary mechanisms of
chemoresponsiveness.

which they can be neutralized by pro-apoptotic binding
partners [3, 4].
When overexpressed in acute myeloid leukaemia
cells, the survival proteins BCL-2 and MCL-1 confer
chemoresistance [3, 5-7]. Pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK
apoptosis effector function is thought to require the
simultaneous neutralisation of all expressed pro-survival
BCL family members, such that if MCL-1 is inhibited,
BCL-2 may prevent apoptosis and vice versa [3, 8, 9].
This relationship was shown at the mechanistic levels by
the complementary apoptotic function of the two sensitiser
proteins NOXA (which targets the labile BCL-2 family
survival proteins MCL-1, BCL2A1 and BCL2A10) and

INTRODUCTION
The ability of therapeutics to kill leukaemia cells
is in part dependent on the net effect of the interplay
between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules. In
particular, when sensitiser BCL-2 family proteins (such
as BAD and NOXA) succeed in displacing activator
proteins (such as BIM) from survival proteins (such as
BCL-2 and MCL-1), the apoptotic effectors/executioners
BAX and BAK activate mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilisation (MOMP) and the apoptotic cascade
is set in motion [1, 2]. Thus the influence of BCL-2
family pro-survival molecules depends on the extent to

BAD (which targets BCL-2 and BCL-XL). NOXA and
BAD together were toxic in a cellular assay where neither
was effective individually [10].
Several researchers have indicated that an agent
which targets BCL-2 can synergise with an agent
that targets MCL-1 [11-13]. In the current report, we
demonstrate roles for NOXA and BAD in this type of
dual dependency. We build upon the complementary
function described for NOXA and BAD and investigate
whether a chemotherapeutic agent that mimics the MCL-1
sensitising role of NOXA will co-operate with a BADBH3 peptide to trigger MOMP. Likewise we investigate
whether an agent that mimics the BCL-2 sensitising role
of BAD will co-operate with a NOXA-BH3 peptide to
trigger MOMP (Figure 1 – schematic diagram). Finally
we investigate the effects of using the two agents together
to target AML cells.
ABT-199 is a small molecule BH3 mimetic,
selective for BCL-2 and orally bioavailable [14, 15].
TG02 is a novel multi-kinase inhibitor which exerts
greatest activity against the cyclin dependent kinase
CDK9 (IC50 3nM) [16]. CDK9 is permissive for
transcription by phosphorylation of RNA polymerase
II on serine 2 (RPIIS2), and in AML cells TG02
treatment causes rapid RPIIS2 dephosphorylation,
such that RNA synthesis is strongly inhibited [16-18]
and proteins with a short half-life, such as MCL-1, are
rapidly downregulated [16, 17]. Our findings indicate

the ability of TG02 to co-operate with BAD, the ability
of ABT-199 to co-operate with NOXA and the ability
of the two chemotherapeutic agents to co-operate with
each other to induce cytochrome C release and apoptosis
in AML cells.

RESULTS
TG02 and ABT-199 have complementary BH3
profiles
To select suitable cells for our experiments we first
established dose responses to the agents individually
in three cell lines – MV4.11, KG-1a and OCI-AML-3.
Responses were evaluated at 24 hours by alamar blue
assay. All 3 cell lines were sensitive to nanomolar
concentrations of TG02 (Figure 2A), but OCI-AML-3 are
all eradicated, whereas MV4.11 and KG1a curves flatten
with approximately 40% of cells remaining viable. OCIAML3 cells were highly resistant to ABT-199 (Figure
2B); MV4.11 were sensitive and KG1a had intermediate
sensitivity. BCL-2 and MCL-1 protein expression was
similar in all three cell lines (Figure 2C).
Exposure of cells to drugs has been shown to
reduce the concentration of BIM-BH3 peptide needed to
induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation
(MOMP) in sensitive samples [19]. BAD and NOXA are

Figure 1: Schematic diagram. In this simplified scenario, TG02 as well as endogenous NOXA suppress the pro-survival function of

MCL-1 and maybe of additional labile BCL-2 family pro-survival proteins (LBPP) [17, 20, 40]. ABT-199 and endogenous BAD suppress
the pro-survival function of BCL-2 [14, 20, 40]. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP), cytochrome C release and
subsequent apoptosis result from antagonism of pro-survival proteins. In some cell types, MOMP may arise from targeting either BCL-2 or
MCL-1 alone, whereas some cells might require more than one survival molecule to be suppressed.

sensitiser BH3 proteins which can trigger MOMP and
apoptosis by releasing BIM from anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins. BAD specifically releases BIM from
BCL-2, whereas NOXA targets MCL-1 [20]. Direct cooperation between BAD and NOXA in inducing apoptosis
has been reported [10], suggesting that therapeutic agents
which sensitise to BAD may complement agents which
sensitise to NOXA, (Figure 1), likely through increasing
the BIM released. To investigate this further, we used
BH3 profiling, a technique which measures cytochrome
C release in response to peptides derived from BH3-only
pro-apoptotic family members [2, 21]. The technique
is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1. Loss of MCL1 might be expected to release pro-apoptotic proteins
which transfer to the remaining BCL-2 or BCLXL, and
can be detected by increased sensitivity to their antagonist
peptide BAD-BH3 [22]. We found that TG02 triggered
cells for a nearly complete response after priming with
BAD-BH3, but not NOXA-BH3 (Figure 2D). In KG1a
cells, the specific RNA Polymerase II (RPII) inhibitor
5,6-dicholoro-1-β-D-ribofuranoslybenzimidazole (DRB)
was used at the previously determined IC50 [18] to
determine whether the BAD-priming effect was generic to
RPII inhibition and this was found to be the case (P<0.001,
Supplementary Figure 2). ABT-199, in contrast to TG02,
triggered MV4.11 and KG-1a cells to respond to the
MCL-1 sensitiser NOXA-BH3 (Figure 2E) indicating that
endogenous pro-apoptotic proteins released from BCL-2
transfer to MCL-1 and thus render the cells sensitive to
the MCL-1 antagonist NOXA. The residual capacity of
KG-1a cells triggered with ABT-199 to respond to BADBH3 was abrogated when ABT-737 (which targets BCLXL as well as BCL-2) was used as trigger, and this was
associated with over-expression of BCL-XL in these cells
(Supplementary Figure 2), likely providing an additional
target for BAD-BH3. Strikingly, the TG02/BAD-BH3
and ABT-199/NOXA-BH3 combinations were effective
except in the case of OCI-AML3’s failure to respond to
the ABT-199/NOXA-BH3 combination. As these cells
were also insensitive to killing by ABT-199 (Figure
2B), this suggested that only effective drugs would be
complemented by the appropriate BH3 peptide and
therefore the study was expanded, as described below.

the main implication is that there is residual capacity in
these primary samples targeted by one agent to respond to
a peptide antagonising a complementary survival pathway.
The cytotoxicity of the drugs corresponded closely to the
degree of complementary peptide priming. The example
of sample P1 in Figure 3 (low cytotoxicity of ABT-199
coupled with low NOXA-BH3 priming, as with the OCIAML-3 cells) suggests that, at the concentrations used, the
peptides are not triggering MOMP in their own right, but
prime the cells to release Cytochrome C in the presence of
an appropriate trigger of a complementary pathway.

TG02 and ABT-199 synergise to induce apoptosis
The dynamic profiling data demonstrate that, when
MCL-1 is targeted, the cells primed with BAD undergo
MOMP and when BCL-2 is targeted, the cells primed with
NOXA undergo MOMP. This shows that the cells have
residual capacity, when targeted by one agent, to respond
to a complementary pathway, and further suggests that
TG02 might co-operate with ABT-199 in cells that are
dependent on both BCL-2 and MCL-1. As preliminary
investigation had shown limited efficacy of these
compounds individually in KG-1a cells, this cell line was
selected for analysis of a combinatorial approach. KG1a are multidrug resistant, CD34+, CD38 +/- cells which
express negative-to low levels of BCL2A1 and BCL2L10
(data not shown); thus MCL-1 is the only one of the
three NOXA-targeting labile BCL-2 family pro-survival
proteins to be significantly expressed in these cells.
After 4 hours of treatment, TG02 down-regulates MCL1 (by 40%) but not BCL-2 (Figure 4A). The use of the
caspase inhibitor Z-VAD indicates that the loss of MCL-1
precedes caspase activation. The use of the proteasome
inhibitor MG132 confirms that, in this cell line, MCL-1
protein expression has the expected high dependence on
proteasome-mediated degradation [23] (contributing to
its short half-life) and we show the contrast with BCL-2,
which is not subject to similar proteasomal degradation.
In the KG-1a cells, synergy was documented for the
combination of TG02 with ABT-199, (Figure 4B). Briefly,
using the median effects method of Chou and Talalay, a
combination index (CI) of around 1.0 shows an additive
relationship. Antagonism increases with increasing CI
above 1.0 and synergy is reflected in a decreasing CI [24].
In the current study strongly synergistic combinations
are characterised by low CIs, evident across several
concentrations, decreasing with dose and reaching as
low as 0.14 at the higher concentrations associated with
cytotoxic (rather than/as well as cytostatic) effects. A series
of additional assays suggested largely cytostatic effects
for the single agents and confirmed that the combination
induces apoptotic cell death (Figure 4C-4F). BAK and
BAX are important components of the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway, through their ability to create
oligomeric pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane

Effects of TG02 AND ABT-199 in primary
samples
To further explore the general applicability of
complementary profiling, and whether the apparent
correlation between priming and cell killing could be
extended to primary cells, we turned our attention to
samples from AML patients. Dynamic BH3 profiling using
BAD-BH3 and NOXA-BH3 peptides illustrated that the
preference for TG02 to sensitise to BAD and of ABT-199
to sensitise to NOXA, shown above in AML cell lines, is
also true of patient cells (Figure 3). As with the cell lines,

[1]. Exposure of activation-sensitive epitopes of BAK
and BAX, measured by antibodies specific for activated
conformations [25, 26], has previously been described
in sensitive cells following exposure to the dual BCL-2/
BCL-XL inhibitor ABT-737 [27]. Moreover depletion
of BAX or BAK confers resistance to TG02 [28] and
ABT-737 [11], although ABT-199 has not been reported
in this context. We found stronger induction of BAK
activated conformation in cells treated with combinations
compared to single agent treatment (Figure 4C), We also
found strong induction of BAX activated conformation
in cells treated with combinations, contrasted with single
digit effects with single agent treatment (Figure 4D).
Active caspase 3 and phosphatidylserine exposure were
induced strongly by the combination, but weakly by the
single agents (Figure 4E and 4F), indicative of largely

growth-inhibitory effects of the agents used individually
and apoptotic effects for the combination. In a control
experiment, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD did not
inhibit BAX or BAK activation, but blocked caspase 3
activation (data not shown). We further showed that the
downregulation of MCL-1, previously noted with TG02
alone, was delayed at 2 hours but unimpaired at 4 hours
of the drug combination, although ABT-199 alone had no
effect on this protein (Figure 4G).
Initial experiments comparing responses to TG02,
ABT-199 and the combination in patient samples showed
a wide range of responsiveness, as represented in Figure
5A. Some samples responded strongly to TG02, others
to ABT-199 and some to both drugs, such that it was not
appropriate to standardise a dose ratio and thus formally
assess synergy in this cohort. However, we investigated

the toxicity of the ABT-199 and TG02 combination in
primary samples treated overnight with both low doses
and high doses of the agents singly and in combination.
With low doses - 12.5 nM TG02, 25 nM ABT-199,
or the combination, we found the combination to be
significantly more toxic than either agent individually
(P=0.001 for both agents, Figure 5B). Some samples were
markedly more sensitive to one agent than the other, and
other samples were sensitive to both, indicating that in
this heterogeneous disease, the combinatorial approach
broadens the range of samples that can be effectively
killed.
It might be argued that the effects of apoptosisinducing agents should be studied at high concentrations
in order to document their abilities to eradicate the cells,
so we also treated 18 primary samples with the higher
concentrations of 50 nM TG02 + 50 nM ABT-199 or
100 nM of the 2 agents individually. We showed that
using either agent at 100 nM was overall less effective

than the combination of 50 nM of each drug (Figure 5C).
Another point of note is that whereas the toxicity of ABT199 reaches a plateau at around 25 nM, the toxicity of
TG02 continues to increase, and the majority of cells are
eradicated at 100 nM, as previously reported [17].
Active BAX was measured at early timepoints and
showed that BAX activation can be seen as early as 2
hours post ABT-199 treatment in sensitive samples and 4
hours with TG02 (Figure 5D).
A combinatorial approach might be less
therapeutically valuable if AML patient samples could be
grouped into discrete groups of BCL-2 over-expressers and
MCL-1 over-expressers, thereby stratifying this population
into subsets potentially responsive to each drug as a single
agent. We measured BCL-2 and MCL-1 using RNA from
117 CD2+cell-depleted primary samples and show here that
there is no trend for primary AML samples to group into
distinct MCL1-over-expressing and BCL-2-overexpressing
samples (Spearman’s rho = -0.11, not significant, Figure 6A).

A similar lack of association has been reported by others
at the protein level [29]. We have previously reported that
sensitivity to TG02 varied among primary AML isolates
[17]. We have now measured MCL-1 and BCL-2 in cells
from this historical cohort and found that BCL-2 was
associated with TG02 resistance (Figure 6B). There was no
correlation between MCL-1 expression and TG02 sensitivity
(Figure 6C).

hours in sensitive patient cells, consistent with the direct
inhibitory mode of action of this drug. As yet ABT-199
is not as thoroughly characterised as its first generation
analogue ABT-737, but many of its interactions are likely
to be similar. Resistance to ABT-737 in AML cells can be
reversed by MCL-1 knockdown [11, 12]. Moreover the
ABT-737 sensitivity of AML samples in vitro corresponds
to their sensitivity to peptides derived from the BAD BH3
domain, which binds BCL-2, but not those derived from
the NOXA BH3 domain (which binds MCL-1) [4].
Intriguingly, whereas resistance to TG02 in
primary AML samples is associated with high BCL-2
expression (as shown in Figure 6), others have shown
that resistance to ABT-199 in primary AML samples
is associated with low BCL-2 expression [33]. The
rationale behind a requirement for high BCL-2 for BAD
mimetic effects has emerged from experiments in which
ABT-737 preferentially targets BCL-2 complexed to the
activator BH3 protein BIM, releasing BIM from BCL2 and subsequently activating BAX [30, 34, 35], thus
demonstrating that BCL-2 can act as a reservoir for BH3only apoptosis activators. The ability of BCL-2, and likely
also of MCL-1 [36], to act as reservoirs also helps explain
why cellular sensitivity and expression levels do not
necessarily correlate.
In the KG-1a cell line, we demonstrated synergy
for TG02 with ABT-199. This was greatest at higher
doses, and the data in Figure 4 show that the combination
was able to effect total eradication of the cells, whereas
apoptosis was only weakly induced by the single agents.
After a partial response to a low dose of ABT-199, the
curve for this agent appeared to reach a plateau, also seen
in the patient samples in Figure 5A, attesting well to the
high potency and specificity of this compound.
AML patient samples are heterogeneous in their
responses to both agents, and the complementarity of
the combination may be underpinned by synergy in
some cases, but also by broadening the proportion of
samples that respond. It is of note that we could reduce
the concentration of each compound by 50% and still
have a combination that was more effective than either
agent alone (Figure 5C). The heterogeneity of MCL-1 and
BCL-2 expression in primary samples, and likely even
within individual patient isolates, suggests that it would
be difficult to establish cut-off points that would enable
the clinician to select patients for either MCL-1 or for
BCL-2 targeting, and therefore the use of complementary
agents may offer an ideal solution to this dilemma. ABT199 and TG02 are both currently in clinical development
in multiple hematologic cancers and the current work
establishes a strong rationale for the clinical assessment
of the two agents in combination. Other agents targeting
BCL-2 and MCL-1 have been discussed in recent reviews
[15, 36].
We conclude that TG02 and ABT-199 are
complementary in AML. We further conclude that

DISCUSSION
BH3 sensitiser molecules BAD and NOXA cooperate to induce apoptosis [10], as do NOXA and
the BAD mimetic ABT-737 [30]. We determined the
applicability of the BAD/NOXA co-operating interaction
to two novel chemotherapeutic compounds, TG02
and ABT-199, in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. We used
dynamic BH3 profiling – a methodology for dissecting
mechanisms of apoptosis induction at the functional level
through monitoring changes in the abilities of specific
pro-apoptotic BH3 peptides to induce cytochrome C
release following effective drug priming for cell death
[19]. Cells treated for as little as 4 hours with TG02 had
enhanced sensitivity to BAD-BH3 but not NOXA-BH3
peptides (see Figure 1 for schematic diagram), suggesting
that TG02 indeed acts in a pro-apoptotic manner that
is complementary to BAD, most probably due to the
depletion of MCL-1. We further showed that cells treated
with ABT-199 were sensitive to exogenous NOXA.
This shows that there is residual capacity in AML cells
to allow triggering of the apoptotic response by priming
a complementary pathway (as in Figure 1). KG-1a and
MV4.11 cells also retained some capacity to respond
to BAD-BH3, likely due to residual BCL-XL, which is
targeted by BAD, but not by ABT-199. Further work is in
progress in our laboratory to determine which other AML
drugs have a “NOXA-like” profile, enhancing sensitivity
to BAD, and which have a “BAD-like” profile, enhancing
sensitivity to NOXA.
We have previously shown that inhibition of RPIIS2
by TG02 strongly correlates with BAX activation in
patient samples [18], indicating that the ability of TG02
to induce apoptosis is predicated on its ability to inhibit
the CDK9-RPIIS2 axis. The downregulation of MCL1 and other short half-life proteins by RPII inhibition is
well documented [31, 32]. The lack of correlation between
MCL-1 expression and TG02 sensitivity in patient samples
might be explained by these indirect and variable effects.
TG02 has a wide range of potential mediators of its antitumour activity [16], and we do not assume that MCL1 is the single mechanistic target for TG02. However,
the results of this report, particularly the sensitisation to
BAD-BH3, but not to NOXA-BH3, indicate that targeting
MCL-1 is highly relevant to its mode of action. In
contrast, the BAD mimetic ABT-199, which specifically
targets BCL-2, induced the activation of BAX within two

Dynamic BH3 Profiling, a term recently coined by
Montero, Letai and co-workers [19], is a powerful
technique for early prediction of drug sensitivity in
primary samples, and may be transferrable to specialist
diagnostic laboratories, as evidenced by publications
analysing basal BH3 profiles of AML patient cells [29,

to predict complementarity at the level of apoptosis
induction. This technique is therefore likely to have further
widespread applicability.

Patient cells: preparation

Cell line toxicity assays

Mononuclear cells were obtained by standard
methods from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples
of patients with AML. Cells were cryopreserved until
use. Only samples with >90% post-thaw viability were
assayed.

Cells were set up at 5 X 105/ml and cultured
in R10 or R20 (see above) for 18-22 hours. Toxicity
was measured using Alamar Blue (Roche, Mannheim
Germany) according to manufacturers’ instructions.

from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). z-VAD-fmk was from
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells were cultured for 18-22 hours in R10 with
20 ng/ml each of IL-3, IL-6, stem cell factor and 25 ng/
ml G-CSF, before analysis by flow cytometric viable cell
counting using 7-amino actinomicin D (7-AAD) and fixed
cells as internal standard for quantitation as previously
reported [17].

Protein measurement
Protein concentrations were measured by flow
cytometry and Western blotting.
Flow cytometry
Protein expression of MCL-1 (Abcam #31948)
and BCL-2 (Ancell #357-040) were measured by flow
cytometry as reported [17].
Western blotting
Cells were washed in ice cold PBS and resuspended
in lysis buffer (50nM Tris{pH 7.4}), 150mM NaCL
(Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK), 1% NP-40
(BDH Laboratory supplies, Lutterworth, UK), 0.25%
Na-deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA, 2μg/ml leupeptin, 5μg/

and 3mM sodium orthovanadate for 30 minutes. Samples
were then sonicated before addition of 200mM PMSF and
incubation for 30 minutes on ice. The protein content in
the lysate was determined using Bio-Rad dye reagent and
resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to a nitrocellulose
membrane and blocking in 5% non-fat milk, immunoblotting
was carried out with the antibodies described above. Proteins
were visualized using chemiluminescence (Hyperfilm ECL;
Amersham). The intensity of the signal was analyzed by
Adobe Photoshop CC 2014 software.

MCL-1, BCL-2 and beta 2 microglobulin (B2M)
expression were measured by realtime PCR of RNA
prepared from CD2-depleted samples from untreated
patients exactly as previously reported [17].

BH3 profiling

Authors’ contributions

Cytochrome C release was measured by flow
cytometry after incubation of digitonin-permeabilised cells
with BH3 peptides as described [33]. BH3 peptides were
synthesised by GenScript using published sequences [21].
Reactivities were temperature dependent and were carried
out at 23-25°C. Results in patient cells were only deemed
valid where cell viability as determined by cytochrome C
release in the presence of the mutated BH3 peptide Puma2A
(100 μM) was less than 10% and release of cytochrome C
in the presence of 10 μM BIM-BH3 as positive control was
greater than 90%. In patient cell analysis CD45/side-scatter
gating was used to exclude lymphocytes. Adjustments for
peptide induced cytochrome C release in untreated cells
were made in order to establish agent-specific release,
using the formula 100*(release with agent – release without
agent)/(100 – release without agent).

Detection of apoptotic pathways
Active BAX was measured using the Transduction
labs clone 3 BAX antibody which recognises a
conformationally active epitope [9, 26] in cells which
had been fixed and permeabilised using the Leucoperm
kit from AbD Serotec. Leucoperm was also used to
permeabilise cells for active caspase 3 measurement.
Active BAK (clone TC100/ab1, [38]) was measured in
cells fixed in 0.25% formaldehyde and permeabilised with
0.05% digitonin as previously reported [39].

GRANT SUPPORT

Statistics

Financial support was obtained from the
Nottinghamshire Leukaemia Appeal and the Nottingham
Hospitals Charity.

Statistics were carried out using SPSS version 21
software (Chicago, IL, USA). Univariate analysis of
variance was used for analysis of cell lines. Where patient
data was seen to be non-parametrically distributed it was
analysed accordingly, i.e with Wilcoxon signed rank
tests or Mann Whitney analysis. P values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
