Abstract
Molecularly targeted drug therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment; however, resistance remains a
major limitation to their overall efﬁcacy. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been linked to acquired
resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), independent of mutational resistance mechanisms. AXL is a
receptor tyrosine kinase associated with EMT that has been implicated in drug resistance and has emerged as a
candidate therapeutic target. Across 643 human cancer cell lines that were analyzed, elevated AXL was strongly
associated with a mesenchymal phenotype, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer and non–small cell lung
cancer. In an unbiased screen of small-molecule inhibitors of cancer-relevant processes, we discovered that AXL
inhibition was speciﬁcally synergistic with antimitotic agents in killing cancer cells that had undergone EMT and
demonstrated associated TKI resistance. However, we did not ﬁnd that AXL inhibition alone could overcome
acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in the EMT setting, as previously reported. These ﬁndings reveal a novel
cotreatment strategy for tumors displaying mesenchymal features that otherwise render them treatment
refractory. Cancer Res; 74(20); 5878–90. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a vital cellular process during normal development, and contributes to
the invasive and metastatic properties of human tumors (1).
EMT has also been implicated in resistance to multiple cancer
drug therapies, including several tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI). Thus, drug-sensitive cancer cell lines selected in culture
for acquired drug resistance can adopt a mesenchymal phenotype (2–4). Moreover, EMT has been associated with
acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer (2, 5).
The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is a member of the
TAM family kinases, which also includes TYRO-3 and MER (6).
AXL is overexpressed in many solid tumors (4, 7–10), although
activating mutations have not been observed (11). AXL has one
known ligand, Gas6 (12), and ligand binding promotes cell
proliferation, survival, and migration through activation of the
PI3K–AKT–S6K and ERK–MAPK pathways (9, 13–15). AXL
expression may be a negative prognostic factor for patients

with breast and pancreatic cancer (7, 9), and may be a unique
EMT effector in breast cancer progression (7, 16).
The association of AXL with EMT has prompted interest in
AXL as a therapeutic target. AXL has been associated with a
mesenchymal signature in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
and has been proposed as a therapeutic target in EGFR TKI
resistance (17), and in a model of acquired erlotinib resistance,
EMT associated with elevated AXL appeared to underlie
erlotinib resistance (4). Moreover, cotreatment of EGFR
wild-type NSCLC xenografts with erlotinib and an anti-AXL
antibody decreased tumor volume and metastasis (18). Similarly, lapatinib-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cells
demonstrated elevated AXL (19), and AXL knockdown reportedly re-sensitizes imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines to imatinib (20).
We broadly surveyed AXL expression in a large panel of
human cancer cell lines, and assessed its role in drug resistance
associated with a mesenchymal phenotype. AXL expression
was well correlated with a mesenchymal phenotype in the
context of both intrinsic and drug resistance–associated EMT.
AXL inhibition did not detectably increase sensitivity to TKIs
as previously reported; however, we observed a striking synergistic interaction between AXL inhibition and antimitotic
agents speciﬁcally in mesenchymal tumor cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Cell lines were from American Type Culture Collection or
Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismenund Zelkulturen,
and were obtained between 2010 and 2014. All cell lines were
authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) proﬁling and SNP
ﬁngerprinting, and were conﬁrmed to be Mycoplasma-negative

AXL Inhibition Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Antimitotics

by the Genentech cell line banking facility (gCELL) before use
(see Supplementary Data). Cells were maintained in culture for
a 6-week period and thereafter a fresh vial of cells was obtained
from gCELL. To induce EMT, cells were treated with 2 ng/mL of
rh-TGFb1 every 3 days over a 2- to 3-week period.

Time-lapse imaging
Cells were seeded in a glass-bottomed 24-well plate (Greiner
Bio-One). Hundred cells per treatment were tracked and
mitotic fate and cell death were scored as described previously
(22).

Inhibitors
Erlotinib and cisplatin were from LC laboratories. Docetaxel
and doxorubicin were from Sigma. PF-03814735, BI-2536, MP470, and PHA-739358 were from Selleck Chemicals. Paclitaxel
was from Tocris. Gemcitabine was from Toronto Research.
R428 was from Synkinase. Recombinant human AXL–Fc, Gas6,
and TGFb1 were from R&D Systems.

Xenograft studies
All procedures were approved by and conformed to the
guidelines and principles of the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Genentech and were carried out in an
Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited facility. Five million HeLa or
MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated in the right ﬂank of Nu/
Nu nude mice. When tumors reached 100 to 200 mm3, mice
were treated with vehicle control, R428 (125 mg/kg ﬁve times
per week; oral gavage), docetaxel (10 mg/kg three times a week,
intravenously for HeLa and 10 mg/kg once a week, intravenously for MDA-MB-231), or the combination. Tumors were
measured three times weekly using digital calipers and tumor
volumes were calculated as [L  (W  W)]/2. Differences
between R428 and docetaxel combination groups and individual-treated and control groups were determined using the twoway ANOVA.

RNA-seq analysis
RNA from cell lines and was used to prepare libraries using
the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). Libraries
were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Expression of AXL and Gas6 RNA was extracted from a database
derived from RNA-seq analysis (Klijn and colleagues; manuscript in preparation).
Immunoblotting
Immunodetection of proteins was performed using standard protocols. The AXL, MER, TYRO-3, E-cadherin, vimentin, phospho-CDC2 (Tyr 15), CDC2, phospho-AKT, total AKT,
phospho-S6, total S6, and GAPDH antibodies were from Cell
Signaling Technology, and the PARP antibody was from
eBioscience.
Gas6 ELISA
Cells were incubated overnight and replenished in fresh
RPMI-1640 media. Medium was collected 24 hours later and
was analyzed using the Human GAS6 Quantikine ELISA Kit from
Quantikine, R&D Systems. ELISA was performed as per the
manufacturer's instructions and normalized to cell number.
Invasion assay
Cell suspensions were prelabeled with DilC12(3) from BD
Biosciences in serum-free RPMI media that was added to the
apical chamber of the BD BioCoat Tumor Invasion System,
8 mm from BD Biosciences. Invasion assays were performed
as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Kinase proﬁling
The R428 kinase proﬁle was performed at KINOMEscan.
R428 was screened at 1,000 nmol/L, and results for primary
screen binding interactions are reported as percentage control,
where lower numbers indicate stronger binding.
Cell viability
Cell viability was assessed as previously described (21).
RNA interference
AXL knockdown was achieved by transfection using ONTARGETplus AXL siRNA (Dharmacon) and Lipofectamine
RNAiMax (Invitrogen). ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Pool
siRNA (Dharmacon) served as control.

Statistical analysis
Bliss expectation was calculated as (A þ B)  A  B, where A
and B are the fractional growth inhibitions of drug A and B at a
given dose. The difference between Bliss expectation and
observed growth inhibition of the combination of drugs A and
B at the same dose is the "Delta Bliss excess." Delta Bliss values
were summed across the dose matrix to generate the Bliss sum.
Differences between two groups were determined using the
Student t test, P values are represented as  , P < 0.05,  , P < 0.01,
and  , P < 0.001. Differences between the R428 and docetaxel
combination groups and individual-treated and control groups
were determined using the two-way ANOVA.

Results
AXL expression correlates with a mesenchymal
phenotype
Using RNA-seq, we proﬁled mRNA expression of AXL (Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Dataset S1) and its ligand Gas6 (Supplementary Fig. S1A) in 643 human cancer cell lines. AXL expression in cell lines from breast and lung demonstrated the
greatest dynamic range within a tissue subset, where expression levels could readily classify most lines as "AXL-high" or
"AXL-low." Gas6 mRNA was more uniformly expressed. To
identify a potential correlation between AXL expression and
the mesenchymal phenotype, we examined expression of the
epithelial marker E-cadherin and the mesenchymal marker
vimentin (Supplementary Fig. S1B). AXL-high cells generally
expressed abundant vimentin, whereas AXL-low cells demonstrated higher E-cadherin expression. AXL-high cells showed,
on average, a 4.6-fold increase in vimentin relative to AXL-low
cells (P ¼ 2.04e24; Supplementary Fig. S1C). Thus, AXL
expression is strongly associated with a mesenchymal phenotype in human cancer cell lines.

AXL Inhibition Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Antimitotics

Within breast cancer subtypes, AXL is relatively elevated
within the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subset compared with estrogen (ER)-positive/progesterone (PR)-negative
and HER2-ampliﬁed subsets (Fig. 1B). GAS6 is similarly elevated
in the TNBC subset (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Correspondingly,
AXL protein was highly elevated in TNBC relative to the other
subtypes (Fig. 1C). We expanded the TNBC panel and observed a
particularly strong correlation between AXL expression and the
mesenchymal subset of TNBC lines (Fig. 1D and Supplementary
Fig. S1E). Expression of the AXL-related TYRO-3 RTK is variable,
and is not correlated with any particular subset, and MER
expression is inversely correlated with AXL (Fig. 1D).
Immunohistochemistry analysis of TNBC tumors revealed
that most expressed E-cadherin, with 20 of 26 cases exhibiting
strong membranous staining in all tumor cells and four displaying focal expression in malignant cells (Supplementary Fig.
S2). Signiﬁcantly, seven of 26 samples displayed vimentin
tumor cell staining in varying proportions of malignant cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In all samples, vimentin and AXL were
detected in normal stroma cells. AXL staining of a small
proportion of tumor cells was seen in three of 26 tumor
samples (Supplementary Fig. S2). The observed percentage of
AXL-positive TNBCs is consistent with recent previous reports
(23, 24).
In NSCLC, a previous report correlated the mesenchymal
phenotype with sensitivity to the EGFR TKI, erlotinib (25).
Indeed, AXL tended to be elevated in erlotinib-insensitive cells
with relatively high vimentin (Fig. 1E). Conversely, cell lines
with greater erlotinib sensitivity tended to exhibit lower
vimentin and AXL expression. This relationship was also
observed with RNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1F).
These results indicate a strong correlation between AXL
expression and a mesenchymal/drug–resistant phenotype in
breast cancer and NSCLC cells.
TGFb-induced EMT is associated with increased AXL and
TKI resistance
To explore a functional requirement for AXL in EMT-associated drug resistance, we experimentally induced EMT in
cancer cell lines with previously established drug sensitivity
by treatment with TGFb (1, 26, 27). Exposure of EGFR- or
HER2-"addicted" cell lines to TGFb yielded the expected EMT,
with transition from a compact uniform appearance to a
spindle-like morphology (Fig. 2A), as well as loss of E-cadherin
and gain in vimentin (Fig. 2B), and increased invasion capacity
(Fig. 2C). EMT is a reversible process, and indeed, upon
withdrawal of TGFb for 2 weeks, the mesenchymal cells
reverted to an epithelial phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S3A).

Expression of AXL and GAS6 was substantially induced upon
EMT, consistent with AXL's association with a mesenchymal
phenotype (Fig. 2B and D). Signiﬁcantly, HER2-ampliﬁed
HCC1954 cells, following EMT, exhibited 10-fold reduced sensitivity to the HER2/EGFR TKI lapatinib (parental: IC50, 0.456
mmol/L; TGFb: IC50, 4.036 mmol/L; Fig. 2E). Similarly, EGFRmutant NSCLC PC9 cells exhibited 4-fold reduced erlotinib
sensitivity following EMT (parental: IC50, 0.05 mmol/L; TGFb;
IC50, 0.214 mmol/L; Fig. 2F). In HCC1954 and PC9 cells, postEMT, TKI treatment failed to promote apoptosis (Fig. 2G). TKI
resistance in the mesenchymal cells did not reﬂect drug efﬂux,
as TKIs induced strong suppression of downstream signaling
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Thus, upon TGFb-induced EMT in
RTK oncogene-addicted cancer cells lines, the resulting mesenchymal cells exhibit substantially increased AXL, and
become drug resistant.
EMT-associated drug resistance is independent of AXL
function
Recent reports have implicated AXL in acquired drug
resistance (4, 19, 20). Therefore, we used these models to
examine a functional AXL requirement in EMT-associated
drug resistance. Initially, we used R428, an AXL kinase
inhibitor (Supplementary Dataset S2; ref. 28). As expected,
R428 effectively suppressed GAS6-induced phospho-AXL
(Supplementary Fig. S4A), phospho-AKT, and phospho-S6
levels (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C), and decreased
invasion capacity of AXL-expressing cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4D). These effects were not observed in AXL-negative
BT-20 cells. We tested the ability of R428 to restore erlotinib
sensitivity in a TGFb-induced resistance model and in two
models of acquired erlotinib resistance demonstrating EMT
and increased AXL (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S5A). In
both parental and drug-resistant cell lines, we observed
either very weak R428/erlotinib synergy (positive delta Bliss)
or antagonistic interaction (negative delta bliss; Fig. 3A
and C), with no change in cell viability (Fig. 3A). Similarly,
there was no change in the IC50 value for erlotinib sensitivity
in combination with R428 (1 mmol/L) in either model
(Fig. 3D and E). Furthermore, AXL knockdown did not
restore erlotinib sensitivity in either of the resistance models
(Fig. 3F–H and Supplementary Fig. S5B). In addition, inhibition of AXL using an AXL–Fc fusion protein, an anti-AXL
antibody, YW327.6S2 (Supplementary Fig. S5C and S5D),
doxycycline-inducible AXL knockdown (Supplementary Fig.
S5E–S5G), or overexpression of AXL (Supplementary Fig.
S6A–S6C), does not detectably affect sensitivity to erlotinib.
Finally, cotreatment of resistant cells with either AXL–Fc

fusion protein or the AXL antibody with erlotinib did not
prevent the emergence of drug-resistant clones (Supplementary Fig. S6D).
We next examined R428 activity in an AXL-negative EMTassociated resistance model. EGFR-mutant HCC827 NSCLC
cells, upon TGFb treatment, become mesenchymal (Fig. 1E,
lane 48 and 49) and erlotinib resistant (Fig. 3D), but do not
exhibit AXL induction (Fig. 1E). R428 did not sensitize these
cells to erlotinib (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, MP-470, another AXL
inhibitor (4), did not synergize with erlotinib (Supplementary
Fig. S7A). Notably, AXL expression was consistently suppressed
by TKI treatment in the mesenchymal cells (Fig. 2G), further
indicating that AXL is not required for the observed resistance.

These collective observations do not support a role for AXL
inhibition in overcoming acquired resistance to TKIs in the
EMT context.
AXL inhibition sensitizes erlotinib-resistant
mesenchymal cells to docetaxel
TGFb-induced EMT or erlotinib-induced resistance yields
mesenchymal cells that are cross-resistant to many anticancer agents (Supplementary Table S1 and data not shown).
We explored whether AXL inhibition could sensitize resistant mesenchymal cells to other anticancer agents. PC9 cells
and mesenchymal derivatives were screened for sensitivity
to 100 anticancer agents. Mesenchymal cells were selectively

with docetaxel and R428 was synergistic in both models (Fig.
4A and B). Similarly, in the drug-resistant HCC827 ERL-R
and HCC4006 ERL-R cells, greater sum Bliss scores were
observed (Fig. 4B). In contrast, we did not observe synergy
with R428 and gemcitabine (Fig. 5A).
Cotreatment of drug-resistant mesenchymal cells with R428
and docetaxel dramatically shifted docetaxel IC50 values. Thus,
for mesenchymal PC9 cells, the IC50 for docetaxel alone was
>300 nmol/L, whereas in combination with R428, it was 0.3
nmol/L (Fig. 4C). Similarly, in the erlotinib-resistant mesenchymal HCC4006 cells, the IC50 for docetaxel alone was >300
nmol/L, whereas in combination with R428, it was 0.191
nmol/L (Fig. 4D). Conversely, in mesenchymal HCC827 cells,
R428 did not synergistically interact with docetaxel, suggesting
that the observed synergy reﬂects an AXL-targeted effect of

5884

R428 (Fig. 4C). We observed similar synergy between the AXL
inhibitor MP-470 and docetaxel (Supplementary Fig. S7A) and
no change in IC50 values upon cotreatment with MP-470 and
docetaxel in the AXL-negative mesenchymal HCC827 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7B). Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest
that EGFR-mutant cancer cells that become resistant to erlotinib and cross-resistant to docetaxel through innate or druginduced EMT, can be sensitized to docetaxel by AXL inhibition.

We also observed a 5-fold shift in the PHA-739358 IC50 upon
combination treatment with R428 for the MDA-MB-231 cells
[PHA-739358 alone: IC50, 1.63 mmol/L and in combination with
R428 (1 mmol/L), IC50, 0.34 mmol/L (Fig. 5C)]. Thus, AXL
inhibition synergistically blocks cell proliferation in combination with antimitotic agents in mesenchymal cancer cells.

AXL-expressing mesenchymal cell lines (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Dataset S3), and a correlation between AXL expression and the sum Bliss score (Fig. 5B). Similarly, R428
synergized with the related taxane paclitaxel to inhibit
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S8A–S8D), but not with
gemcitabine, doxorubicin, or cisplatin (Fig. 5A and C and
Supplementary Fig. S8F and S8G). We also observed similar
synergy between docetaxel and an AXL–Fc fusion protein,
which blocks GAS6 binding to AXL (18), or with MP-470, in
AXL-high cell lines (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S7C),
and siRNAs targeting AXL further conﬁrmed that AXL
inhibition mediated the observed synergy (Fig. 5E).
Tubulin-binding taxanes cause a sustained mitotic block,
resulting in cell death during mitosis (29). To determine
whether R428 synergistically interacts with antimitotic agents
with distinct mechanisms of action, we tested two aurora
kinase inhibitors, PHA-739358 and PF-03814735, and the PLK1
(polo kinase) inhibitor BI-2536, which activates the spindle
checkpoint, causing mitotic arrest (Fig. 5A). We observed
synergy between R428 and the aurora kinase and PLK1 inhibitors in AXL-expressing mesenchymal cells (Fig. 5A and C).

AXL kinase inhibition enhances docetaxel activity to
suppress tumor growth
We extended the cell line ﬁndings to an in vivo context
using tumor xenografts. First, we determined that R428 was
pharmacologically active in xenografts (Fig. 6A). To assess
efﬁcacy, mice bearing 100 to 200 mm3 tumors were treated
with R428 and/or docetaxel. R428 or docetaxel slightly
inhibited tumor growth; however, cotreatment caused signiﬁcant tumor growth suppression (Fig. 6B). Similar effects
were seen with MDA-MB-231 xenografts (Fig. 6C). A modest
decrease in body weight appeared to be docetaxel-dependent (Fig. 6B and C). These observations support the potential in vivo utility of AXL inhibitors combined with antimitotic agents.

AXL Inhibition Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Antimitotics

AXL inhibition enhances cell death during mitosis when
combined with antimitotic agents
To establish whether AXL inhibition alters mitotic cell fate
when combined with antimitotic agents, we used time-lapse
microscopy of individual cells to monitor duration of mitosis
and cell fate during mitosis (Fig. 7A; Supplementary Fig. S9;
Supplementary Movies S1–S4). The duration of completed
mitosis in DMSO-treated HeLa cells ranged from 20 to 50
minutes (Fig. 7B), and R428 did not affect duration (Fig. 7B and
Supplementary Movie S1 and S2). In contrast, docetaxel caused
mitotic slippage generating three or four daughter cells (Fig. 7A
and Supplementary Movie S3) and a longer duration of mitosis,
as expected (Fig. 7B). Upon cotreatment with docetaxel and
R428, the percentage of cells that completed mitosis decreased
substantially, and the percentage of cells that died in mitosis
was greatly enhanced from 46% to 93% (Fig. 7A and E and
Supplementary Movies S3 and S4).
The duration of the mitotic cell death interval was comparable between docetaxel treatment alone and cotreatment
with R428 (Fig. 7C). However, cotreatment caused most cells
to enter mitosis and die without completing mitosis (Fig. 7A).
In contrast, with docetaxel alone, the death in mitosis fate
occurred during the second mitosis; thus, cells had completed
one mitotic event before experiencing death in mitosis
(explaining why the combined cell fates total >100). To quantify this event, we recorded the timestamp of the mitotic death
event, and observed a signiﬁcant effect of combination treatment. Thus, the death in mitosis event occurred substantially
earlier (25.14  0.86 hours for combination versus 41.74  1.98
hours docetaxel alone; Fig. 7D). We similarly observed
enhanced mitotic death in combination-treated MDA-MB231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S9D–S9G). Moreover, the
enhanced death in mitosis was dependent on the docetaxel
concentration (Supplementary Fig. S9D and S9G).
As with R428, cotreatment with MP-470, or the AXL–Fc
protein, and docetaxel resulted in altered cell fate during
mitosis (Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B). Similar results were
seen upon cotreatment with PHA-739358 and R428 (Fig. 7A). In
contrast, cotreatment with R428 and gemcitabine did not alter
mitosis or mitotic fate (Supplementary Fig. S9C). These ﬁndings support the speciﬁcity of AXL inhibition in potentiating
the mitotic fate effect of antimitotic agents in mesenchymal
tumor cells.
AXL's role in mitotic fate is associated with CDC2
dysregulation
Cell death during mitosis is caspase-dependent (30), and
mitotic fate is determined by both caspase activation and
cyclin B1 degradation. Enhanced caspase activation and slower
cyclin B1 decay promotes death in mitosis, whereas, delay in
caspase activation and enhanced cyclin B1 degradation causes
mitotic slippage. Docetaxel induced caspase-3/7 activation;
however, upon R428 cotreatment, caspase-3/7 activity was
induced faster and more robustly than with docetaxel (Fig.
7F), paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S8D), or PHA-739358 (Supplementary Fig. S8E) alone. In contrast, no effects on cyclin B1
were observed with docetaxel, even in combination with R428
(data not shown). Cotreatment with R428 and docetaxel

www.aacrjournals.org

increased G2–M arrest from 36.2% (docetaxel alone) to
51.2% (Fig. 7G). We observed enhanced PARP cleavage following cotreatment with R428 and either, docetaxel, paclitaxel, or
PHA-739358 (Fig. 7H and Supplementary Fig. S8C), conﬁrming
that the observed death in mitosis event was apoptotic.
PI3K inhibition can enhance docetaxel efﬁcacy in breast
cancer models (31), and consistent with this observation,
suppression of phospho-AKT and phospho-S6 by R428 was
further enhanced by docetaxel (Supplementary Fig. S10A). A
critical regulator of mitotic entry is the cyclin-dependent
kinase-1 (CDC2; ref. 32), via a regulatory phosphorylation at
Tyr15 (33), and cotreatment with R428 and docetaxel enhanced
and sustained CDC2 dephosphorylation (Fig. 7I and Supplementary Fig. S10B). Furthermore, suppression of phosphoCDC2 was observed in R428-treated xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S10C); however, CDC2 protein levels are not affected
by AXL inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S11). These observations suggest that CDC2 is regulated by AXL, and upon
exposure to antimitotic agents, cancer cells rapidly enter
mitosis and remain in mitosis until the death in mitosis event,
implicating CDC2 regulation in sensitization to antimitotic
agents in mesenchymal cancer cells by AXL inhibitors.

Discussion
EMT is an increasingly recognized driver of tumor progression, and accumulating evidence implicates EMT in both
innate and acquired resistance to various anticancer agents.
Our RNA-seq analysis conﬁrmed that AXL expression is indeed
widely associated with a mesenchymal phenotype, particularly
within TNBCs and erlotinib-resistant NSCLCs. However, the
low percentage of AXL-positive tumors in TNBC does not
correlate with the in vitro ﬁndings and remains to be fully
understood. Targeting AXL might therefore be an attractive
therapeutic approach to overcoming resistance associated
with EMT.
Our observations do not support a role for AXL inhibition in
overcoming acquired drug resistance in the EMT context. This
may reﬂect, in part, the fact that many of the tool compounds
used in recent reports are multikinase inhibitors, lacking AXL
selectivity (4, 17). Furthermore, there may be off-target cytotoxic effects of AXL-targeted RNAi reagents. Notably, a recently
reported analysis of NSCLC cells with acquired erlotinib resistance and increased AXL levels similarly excluded a functional
role for AXL (34).
Although our ﬁndings do not support a rationale for AXL
inhibition in the context of acquired TKI resistance, we found
that AXL inhibition may be effective in mesenchymal tumors,
speciﬁcally in combination with antimitotic agents. In TNBC,
patients typically present a signiﬁcant clinical challenge, as
they do not respond to the various targeted cancer therapies
due to an apparent lack of RTK activation. However, patients
with TNBC do show some response to taxane-based chemotherapy (35), and our studies suggest that combining antimitotics with AXL inhibition may be an appropriate combination
therapy in this disease setting.
Taxane-based therapies exert their cytotoxic effects by
binding and stabilizing microtubules, resulting in cell-cycle

AXL Inhibition Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Antimitotics

arrest in mitosis. The response to antimitotic agents can vary
signiﬁcantly among cancer cells. Thus, some cells undergo
death during prolonged mitosis, while others undergo slippage
and die in interphase (29). The degree of caspase activation and
the level of cyclin B1 degradation can determine cell fate during
mitosis (30). Several treatments reportedly enhance the efﬁcacy of taxane-based therapy, such as navitoclax (BCL-2/BCLXL inhibitor), and the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (22, 31, 36). In
these studies, the enhanced efﬁcacy of combination treatment
reﬂected a decrease in the duration of mitosis until mitotic cell
death, an enhanced rate of apoptosis, the downregulation of
cyclin D1 and pAKT, and altered kinetics of BCL-2 family
protein stabilization. AXL engages some of these pathways,
particularly the PI3K/AKT pathway (13, 14), which we found
was suppressed by R428, particularly upon cotreatment with
docetaxel, which may contribute to the observed synergy. Our
ﬁndings also indicate that the observed synergy with AXL
inhibition reﬂects altered kinetics of dephosphorylation of
CDC2, a cell cycle–dependent kinase that governs mitotic
entry. However, it remains unclear as to how AXL, relative to
other RTKs that transduce signals to largely overlapping
downstream effectors, speciﬁcally regulates this signaling
event in the context of mitosis.
