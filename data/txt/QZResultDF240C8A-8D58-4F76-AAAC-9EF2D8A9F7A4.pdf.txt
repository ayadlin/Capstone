BACKGROUND: Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR-ABL1) tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) improve the outcome of patients with childhood Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
when they are incorporated into postremission induction chemotherapy. To date, no data are available on the impact of TKIs on minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction therapy among patients who have a poor early response to 2 weeks of induction
therapy that does not include TKIs. METHODS: The authors analyzed the early response to TKIs during remission induction in children
with Ph-positive ALL who were treated at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. MRD was measured on days 15 and 42 of induction.
TKIs were incorporated into induction therapy on day 22 in the post-TKI era. RESULTS: TKIs produced a marked drop in MRD levels:
at the end of remission induction, 9 of 11 patients who received imatinib or dasatinib and conventional induction chemotherapy
achieved MRD-negative status compared with only 2 of 16 patients who received chemotherapy alone (P <.001). The 5-year eventfree survival rate (6 standard deviation) was 68.6% 6 19.2% for the 11 patients who received TKIs versus 31.6% 6 9.9% for the 19
patients who did not (P 5.022); notably, 2 of the former group underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation versus 15 of the
latter group (P 5.002). MRD levels and outcomes did not differ significantly among 498 patients with standard-risk/high-risk, Phnegative ALL who were treated in the pre-TKI or post-TKI eras. CONCLUSIONS: TKIs administered in the early phases of therapy can

INTRODUCTION
The t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) chromosomal translocation, ie, the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, and the resulting breakpoint
cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR-ABL1) fusion protein1 occur in 20% to 30% of
adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in 3% to 5% of patients with childhood ALL.2,3 Because of
its high rate of relapse with chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first complete
remission (CR) is often recommended, but the survival benefits resulting from this intervention in childhood Ph-positive
ALL have been modest.4 Over the past decade, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR-ABL1 have been added to
chemotherapy regimens; a Children Oncology Group (COG) study that combined imatinib with intensive postremission
induction chemotherapy yielded a significant improvement in event-free survival (EFS) rates for childhood Ph-positive
ALL.5 The impact of TKIs on early response was not evaluated in that study, because imatinib was introduced after the
completion of induction therapy.
The optimal way to integrate TKIs, conventional chemotherapy, and HSCT into Ph-positive ALL is still unclear.5-7
The introduction of TKIs early during therapy might produce significant gains in initial leukemia cytoreduction,7 which

TKIs in Ph1 Childhood ALL/Jeha et al

could result in less induction failures and, perhaps, reduce
the need for HSCT. However, it is uncertain whether
early attainment of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status warrants the omission of HSCT. In the current study, we measured levels of MRD during and at the
end of remission induction therapy to quantify the impact
of TKIs on the reduction of leukemia burden in childhood Ph-positive ALL. We compared response rates and
overall clinical outcomes in a cohort that received treatment with TKIs with response rates and outcomes in
patients with Ph-positive ALL who received treatment in
the pre-TKI era and in parallel cohorts of patients with
standard-risk/high-risk, Ph-negative ALL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

From December 1991 to October 2012, 1035 patients
(age range, 1-18 years) with newly diagnosed B-lineage
ALL were enrolled in the St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital frontline ALL Total 13 through Total 16 studies.8,9 Of those 1035 patients, 507 were treated on the
low-risk arm, and 528 were treated on the standard-risk/
high-risk arm, including 30 patients with Ph-positive
ALL. The TKIs imatinib (340 mg/m2 daily on the Total
15 study; July 2004 to September 2007) or dasatinib (40
mg/m2 twice daily on the Total 16 study; October 2007
to October 2012) were administered continuously
through all phases of treatment starting on days 22
through 26 of remission induction therapy to patients
with Ph-positive ALL who were diagnosed after an
amendment to the Total 15 study (July 27, 2004;
n 5 11). Diagnosis of Ph-positive ALL was based on conventional cytogenetics/fluorescence in situ hybridization
and detection of the BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript by
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
MRD studies were performed by flow cytometry between
days 15 and 19 of remission induction (“day 15”) and on
hematopoietic recovery at the end of induction (between
days 42 and 46; “day 42”). Some patients (8 in the preTKI group and 5 in the post-TKI group) also had their
MRD tested by PCR amplification of immunoglobulin
and T-cell receptor (Ig/TCR) genes.9 The sensitivity levels
that can be achieved routinely by both flow cytometry and
PCR is 1 in 10,000 leukemic cells in bone marrow mononucleated cells (ie, 0.01%).10 Hence, the cutoff level that
defined positive MRD status by either method was
0.01%. These studies were approved by the institutional
review board, and written informed consent or assent, as
appropriate, was obtained for all patients.

Statistical Methods

Fisher exact tests were used to compare MRD status on
days 15 and 42 among patient groups. EFS and overall
survival (OS) distributions were compared using the
Mantel-Haenszel test, and the associated standard errors
were calculated according to Peto and Pike.
RESULTS
There were no significant differences in presenting features between the 11 patients with Ph-positive ALL who
received TKI treatment (5 received imatinib and 6
received dasatinib) and the 19 patients who received treatment in the pre-TKI era (Table 1). Three of the 19
patients who were treated in the pre-TKI era failed to
achieve morphologic remission at the end of remission
induction therapy, whereas all 11 patients who received
TKIs achieved remission.
Day-42 MRD measurements by flow cytometry
and/or PCR were available for 15 of the 19 Ph-positive
patients who were treated without TKIs (Table 2). The
data in Table 3 indicate that 13 patients were positive for
MRD, and 8 of those patients had MRD levels 1%; 1
patient did not have MRD studies but had 17% blasts
detectable by morphology and had Ph detectable by

Thus, all 9 patients who were classified with very-highrisk ALL according to our risk stratification because they
had 1% MRD and/or or remission induction failure
were among the 19 patients who received chemotherapy
alone.
In contrast to differences observed for day-42 MRD,
MRD levels on day 15, before TKI administration, were
similar between the 2 groups. Thus, among the 22
patients who had day-15 measurements available, all 11
who received chemotherapy alone and 10 of the 11 who
subsequently received TKIs were MRD-positive on day
15 (P 5 .58). Figure 1 illustrates the kinetics of leukemia
cytoreduction between days 15 and 42 produced by the 2
types of treatment; the addition of TKIs reduced MRD
levels in all patients, whereas chemotherapy alone was
largely ineffective.
To ensure that the apparent benefits of TKIs were
not simply related to their inclusion in the context of
more contemporary treatment, we compared day-42
MRD levels among patients with standard-risk/high-risk,
Ph-negative ALL who were treated in the pre-TKI and
post-TKI eras (MRD data were available in 371 of the
498 patients): neither the prevalence of MRD nor its levels differed significantly between the 2 groups (Table 3).
Gains in leukemia cytoreduction with TKIs were associated with a significantly better EFS (Fig. 2A); OS also was
markedly superior, although the difference failed to
achieve statistical significance (Fig. 2B). This improvement in outcome is particularly noteworthy because only
2 of the 11 patients who received TKIs underwent HSCT
versus 15 of the 19 patients who were treated in the preTKI era (P 5 .002). One patient (patient 17 in Table 2)
was MRD-positive by both flow cytometry and PCR at
the end of induction and underwent HSCT during
maintenance therapy per physician preference while in

cytogenetics. By contrast, only 2 of the 11 patients who
received TKIs (1 received imatinib and 1 received dasatinib) were MRD-positive, both at <0.1% (P < .0001).

TKIs in Ph1 Childhood ALL/Jeha et al

were treated with or without TKI. Symbols indicate MRD levels

morphologic remission, but the same patient was MRDnegative by flow cytometry and by Ig/TCR gene PCR;
this patient died while in remission 4 months after
HSCT. The second patient who underwent HSCT
(patient 20 in Table 2) was MRD-negative at the end of
induction and underwent HSCT per physician preference
while in morphologic remission, but this patient was
MRD-negative by both flow cytometry and Ig/TCR gene
PCR; this patient was still in remission 74 months after
HSCT. In the last 5 years, no patient with Ph-positive
ALL has undergone HSCT, because physicians and families have become increasingly comfortable with omitting
HSCT in the TKI era. The use of HSCT remained
unchanged for standard-risk/high-risk, Ph-negative ALL:
of the 498 patients in this group, 20 of 288 patients (7%)
underwent HSCT who received treatment in the pre-TKI
era compared with 19 of 210 patients (9%) who received
treatment in the post-TKI era.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study demonstrate that the incorporation of TKIs into remission induction therapy regimens
for childhood Ph-positive ALL produces a dramatic
decrease in leukemia burden, leading to end-of-induction
MRD levels that are similar to or lower than those
observed among patients with Ph-negative ALL. Hence,
none of the 11 Ph-positive ALL patients who received
TKIs in our study met the definition of very-high-risk
ALL based on our risk classification scheme, whereas 9 of
Cancer

16 patients who received treatment without TKIs met
that definition. These results are in line with those from a
study by Rives et al,7 who reported that most children
with Ph-positive ALL who received imatinib achieved
molecular remission, although this was accomplished for
most patients only after consolidation therapy. Collectively, these results suggest that early responses to TKIs are
superior in patients with pediatric Ph-positive ALL,
because 30% to 50% of adults with Ph-positive ALL never
achieve molecular remission, even when they receive regimens that incorporate TKIs.11-13
The best way to implement MRD-directed therapy
in Ph-positive ALL is unclear.12,13 We measured MRD by
flow cytometry and/or PCR amplification of antigen receptor genes. These methods produce largely equivalent
results in our and others’ experience when a threshold of
0.01% was used to define MRD positivity,14-16 have been
proven to be reliable MRD indicators in previous studies,
and might provide a more accurate quantification of residual leukemic cells than BCR-ABL1 transcripts.17,18 The
presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts after consolidation and before HSCT reportedly correlates with probability of relapse.11,19-21 MRD as measured by PCR
amplification of antigen receptor genes was associated
with risk of relapse in children with Ph-positive ALL in
the pre-TKI era studies,22 but imatinib administered continuously after remission induction therapy containing no
TKIs abrogated its adverse impact.5 In a study in which
adult patients with Ph-positive ALL received TKIs in
combination with chemotherapy on days 1 through 14 of
induction (no TKIs were received for the reminder of the
induction cycle), MRD measured by flow cytometry and
major molecular response measured by BCR-ABL1 transcripts were not significantly related with outcome upon
achievement of morphologic remission, but they were
prognostic at 3 months from starting therapy and
beyond.13 Patient age and TKI schedule might have contributed to this discrepancy in the prognostic value of
MRD at the end of remission induction between that
study and our current trial.
Most adult patients with Ph-positive ALL and, in
some centers, children with suitable donors still undergo
HSCT regardless of their MRD status.5,7,23 Because we
primarily used MRD levels at completion of remission
induction to guide risk stratification on frontline St. Jude
studies with excellent clinical outcome,9,24 we applied
similar principles to Ph-positive ALL, an approach that
dramatically reduced the use of HSCT in our series. Our
results indicate that high survival rates can be obtained
without HSCT in patients with Ph-positive ALL who

achieve negative MRD status at the end of remission
induction therapy. MRD monitoring should be useful to
identify patients who do not respond optimally to TKIs
and who may be candidates for HSCT and/or novel targeted agents. Because the relation between results of the
most prevalent methods for monitoring MRD in ALL
(flow cytometry and PCR amplification of antigen receptor genes) and those for BCR-ABL1 transcript evaluation
remains unclear, it might be worth applying these
approaches in tandem until the value of each method in
the management of patients with Ph-positive ALL is better established.
In summary, emerging data continue to demonstrate
substantial benefit for patients with Ph-positive ALL who
receive chemotherapy regimens incorporating TKIs earlier
and in a more continuous fashion as opposed to an
1518

intermittent or alternating schedule.5 TKIs were well tolerated when incorporated in a continuous fashion into total
therapy with no undue prolonged cytopenia. The addition
of TKIs to induction chemotherapy should be considered
as soon as the diagnosis of Ph-positive ALL is established.
Although it is not yet clear whether chemotherapy plus
TKIs can ultimately replace HSCT in children with Phpositive ALL, the results of our study indicate that MRD
should be used to evaluate early response and guide transplantation decisions in children with Ph-positive ALL.
