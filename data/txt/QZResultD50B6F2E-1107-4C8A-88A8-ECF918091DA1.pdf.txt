ABSTRACT
In this study, we proposed an improved algorithm for identifying proteins
relevant to cancer. The algorithm was named two-layer molecular similarity ensemble
approach (TL-SEA). We applied TL-SEA to analyzing the correlation between anticancer
compounds (against cell lines K562, MCF7 and A549) and active compounds against
separate target proteins listed in BindingDB. Several associations between cancer
types and related proteins were revealed using this chemoinformatics approach. An
analysis of the literature showed that 26 of 35 predicted proteins were correlated
with cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation. Additionally, interactions
between proteins in BindingDB and anticancer chemicals were also predicted. We
discuss the roles of the most important predicted proteins in cancer biology and
conclude that TL-SEA could be a useful tool for inferring novel proteins involved in
cancer and revealing underlying molecular mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

cancer-related proteins because they are both timeconsuming and inefficient. Computational methods rely
on systematic comparisons between the genomes of
cancer cells and normal cells, using correlation analysis
to search for mutated genes associated with tumorigenesis
[5]. However, many of these methods only utilize DNA
sequence information [6–8], and overlook protein
information that is more closely related to biological
pathways and phenotype.
In 2015, Chien-Hung Huang et al. developed a
prediction model of cancer proteins based on proteomic
data [9]. They demonstrated the accuracy of this method
on two independent datasets of lung cancer and lung
cancer microarray. Their prediction achieved hit ratios
of 89.4% and 72.8%, respectively. Two other groups
predicted cancer-related proteins as new drug targets for
cancer treatment with network analyses [10, 11]. These
predictions were mainly based on protein interaction
networks, protein sequences, or motif information.
Importantly, no cancer-related small-molecule activity
data were considered in these studies. Taking into
consideration the limitations of these approaches, there
is a great demand for new methods to infer key proteins
in cancer.

In 1990, approximately 6 million people died of
cancer globally, while in 2010 the number had risen to
about 8 million [1]. Moreover, the incidence of cancer is
increasing rapidly [2]. Current cancer treatments include
surgical therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy;
however, these treatments also damage normal tissues.
Many researchers are focused on developing targeted
molecular therapies that specifically damage tumor tissues
with little damage to normal tissue [3]. Comprehensive
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
cancer is necessary for designing efficacious drugs.
The molecular mechanisms of cancer development
are very complicated, and include lasting proliferation,
malfunction of cell death programs, induction of
angiogenesis, metastasis of cancer cells, changes of
cellular energy metabolism, and evasion of immune
destruction [4]. This complexity, along with a lack of
reliable methods for the large-scale identification of
cancer-related proteins, causes cancer progression to
remain a puzzle and greatly hampers the development
of effective therapies. Traditional experimental methods
are not suitable for the large-scale identification of

With the open-source drug discovery campaign,
massive bioactivity data have been accumulated using
assays ranging from phenotypes to enzymes. For example,
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has launched many
programs for screening compounds against cancer cell
lines and has acquired a large list of active anticancer
chemicals [12]. On the other hand, BindingDB catalogues
an enormous number of active compounds that act on
various proteins [13].
Chemoinformatics approaches can be applied to
compare anticancer compounds from the NCI database
and bioactive compounds against different proteins
from BindingDB, and infer proteins that are involved
in the genesis and proliferation of cancer cells. The
underlying assumption, named similarity principle or
general neighborhood behavior, is that structurally similar
molecules are likely to possess similar biological activities
[14–18]. Provided that anticancer chemical a is very akin
to chemical b, which is active against a protein, it is
possible that a can also change the state of this protein and
the anticancer effects of a depend on the same protein. The
more similar molecule pairs are found, the more correct
is the assumption. Therefore, the association between
these proteins and cancer development can be confirmed
through a systematic statistics probability analysis on
massive activity data about the phenotype and the proteins.
However, the similarity between the ligand set of a
protein and that of a phenotype is very weak and proteinphenotype relationships can be inferred only with very
careful statistical analysis. In 2007, Michael J Keiser et al.
proposed a Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) to infer
relationships among receptors [19]. The SEA algorithm
can be applied to two compound sets at the same level
[20, 21], but is not suitable for systems at two different
levels, such as active compounds against cancer cell lines
and against proteins. Therefore, in this work, we proposed
a modified association algorithm, named two-layer SEA
(TL-SEA), and applied the algorithm to the analysis of the
activity data from the NCI database and BindingDB. Three
cell lines, K562, MCF7 and A549 were used as example
systems. The K562 cell line was derived from the blastic
phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia. It also has some
characteristics of chronic leukemia and acute leukemia
[22]. MCF7 and A549 were derived from human breast
cancer and human lung cancer, respectively. Using TLSEA, we attempted to infer which proteins play roles in
the genesis and proliferation of these cancer cells.

association value (AS score) were more likely to impact
on the development of cancer. In this study, we selected
the proteins with AS scores smaller than 0.03 for further
analysis, resulting in a total of 35 cancer-related proteins
(31, 35, and 28 proteins for K562, MCF7 and A549 cell
lines, respectively; Table 1). There were 25 common
proteins in the three systems. Most of the predicted
proteins were human proteins or their close homologs
except luciferin 4-monooxygenase of firefly. According to
previously published literature, 26 of the 35 proteins are
relevant to the proliferation, apoptosis, or differentiation
of cancer cells. The references are listed in the last column
of Table 1.
Among the 26 proteins, melatonin receptor type 1B
occurs twice. One of them is from chicken (ranked
first in all the cell lines) and the other one from human
(ranked 22nd, 24th, 22nd in the 3 cell lines, respectively).
BLASTP showed that these two proteins were very
similar with E-Value = 7e–150, sequence identity = 71%
and sequence cover = 100%. Melatonin receptors play
an important role in cancer development [23–27], and
have anticancer functions through binding with melatonin
[26]. Melatonin is involved in redox processes of cells,
augments natural killer cell activity, stimulates cytokine
production (IL-2 and IL-6), and protects hematopoietic
precursors from the toxic effect of chemotherapy and
radiotherapy [27]. Studies revealed that breast cancer cell
differentiation is regulated by the MT-1 signaling pathway
[28, 29], while the anticancer function of melatonin is
mediated by MT-1 receptor and G protein-coupled signal
transduction in liver cancer cells [30]. Clinical data also
showed high MT-1 expression is associated with cancer
resistance in people with lower melatonin levels [31].
Melatonin may also protect against gastric cancer in mice
by up-regulation of membrane receptor MT-1 and MT-2
expression [32].
The second and the third proteins in the predicted
list are tubulin beta-1 chain and tissue factor (TF). Tubulin
beta-1 chain is the primary component of microtubules.
Microtubules play a key role in the process of mitosis
[33], which is necessary for cancer cell proliferation. Thus,
disruption of cell mitosis can block the increase in cancer
cells. As early as 2004, there was research on microtubules
as targets for anticancer drugs [34]. Similarly, TF
expression in the cell surface accelerates tumor
progression [35, 36]. TF accelerates malignant tumor
growth, invasion, and metastasis mainly by promoting
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release to
regulate tumor cell angiogenesis [37]. Interestingly, the
VEGF receptor 2 is ranked 23rd in the predicted protein
list. Reduced TF expression can decrease cancer cell
growth, and selective reduction of TF expression with
mRNAi in colorectal cancer cells reduced tumor growth in
mice [38]. These results have been replicated in vitro [39],
and higher TF expression was found in primary carcinoma
of the rectum, breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. Thus,

The list was sorted by K562 significance (AS score), and then by MCF7. References regarding to the proteins related to
proliferation, apoptosis, or differentiation of cancer cells were listed in the last column.

TF expression is related to the invasiveness of cancer [40],
and multiple experimental models have demonstrated that
increasing TF expression promotes tumor growth [41].
For those proteins without direct evidence regarding
their involvement in cancer development, there is a great
chance that they also play important roles in cancer-related
cellular pathways. Of course, this hypothesis remains to
be confirmed with further studies. We analyzed protein
Q8CA95 (cAMP and cAMP-inhibited cGMP 3′,5′-cyclic
phosphodiesterase 10A), which is ranked 5th in all the
predicted proteins and first in the proteins without direct
proof in the literature. The protein hydrolyzes both cAMP
and cGMP, regulating the intracellular concentration of
cyclic nucleotides in the striatum [42]. As a target for
signal transduction regulation, it has not been reported
to have anticancer effects; however, cAMP mediates the
translation of cancer cells into healthy cells [43, 44].
In our algorithm, we needed to calculate the
significance twice, PZ and PO, for the anticancer
compounds-protein association (initial score, I) and the
cell line-protein association (original score, PO). Because
I was summed at different length (m, number of active
compounds against a specific protein), it was translated
into comparable Z score with formula 4. The constants
(a, b, k) were obtained by fitting the initial score and
the number of active compounds with formulae 2 and 3
(Figure 1). The results showed a linear correlation between
the initial score I and compound number m, indicating
the feasibility of the SEA algorithm in such a system. As
mentioned in the methods section, it is unnecessary to
standardize the original score, PO.

three networks as shown in Figure 2 and Supplementary
Figure S1. The nodes in the networks represent proteins
or chemicals, while the edges denote their association.
The three networks are presented with the same layout.
The position of the nodes was optimized with forces
according to the reciprocal of the PZ. For nodes that were
missed in the cell lines, they were fade out to gray. The
other nodes were highlighted with distinguishable colors.
Through this way, the differences between the cell lines
can be visually analyzed. For example, the major prion
protein (node P23097, highlighted with the red rectangle
in Figure 2A) did not existed in K562 but existed in other
two cell lines. Experimental studies showed that the overexpression of P23097 failed to protect DNA fragmentation
in leukemia cancer cell line but it converted TNF-sensitive
cells into TNF-resistant cells in MCF7 breast cancer cell
line [45–46]. Moreover, the expression of major prion
protein were associated with increased lung colonization
[47]. These results are consistent with our predictions.
Some of the predicted interactions in Figure 2 were
reported earlier and truly existed. For example, the PZ
score between anticancer compound thapsia villosa
(NCI_ 
ID 299934) and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic
reticulum calcium ATPase 1 (Uniprot_ID P04191,
SERCA 1) was 1.500 × 10–7, ranking first in MCF7 dataset
(see Supplementary information Table S2). This
compound is indeed a potential inhibitor of the SERCA
pump [48]. In addition, the PZ score between compound
GW805758X (NCI_ID 756364) and protein O14920
(inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta)
was 1.015 × 10–4. Through database searching, this
interaction can be found in ChEMBL (http://ebi.ac.uk/
chembl, ChEMBL Assay ID: CHEMBL2007663).
We analyzed the proteins linked to more than 15
compounds in the three networks (Table 2). Protein
Q61614 (Endothelin-1 receptor) linked to 59 compounds
in the MCF7 dataset, ranked first in all the proteins. The
AS score (PO) between this protein and MCF7 is 0.0033,
indicating that this protein is a potential target for MCF7
cells. Kusuhara M et al. found that breast cancer cells can
release Endothelin-1 [49]. The binding of Endothelin-1
(ET-1) to ET-1 receptor can stimulate growth of breast
cancer cells by autocrine and paracrine signaling, and

Analysis of chemical-protein matrices
In the process of inferring cancer-related proteins,
three anticancer compounds vs BindingDB proteins
association matrices (PZ) emerged. The matrices contained
the significant scores (PZ) between the active chemicals
targeting the cancer cell lines and the BindingDB proteins.
PZ can be used to deduce whether a compound can interact
with a protein. Smaller PZ indicated higher possibility
of interaction. By retaining the matrix elements with
PZ less than 0.0001, the matrices were translated into

increased expression of ET-1, Endothelin A receptor
(ETAR), and Endothelin B receptor (ETBR) in breast
cancer patients lowers disease-free survival time and
overall survival [50].
Among the 27 proteins in Table 2, only 4 proteins
(Q9H4B7, P41586, Q61614 and O02747) were associated
with the cell lines with an AS score (PO) less than 0.03.
This result was caused by different thresholds used in
the original score calculation process and in Figure 2,
which illustrates the protein-compound interactions with
a visual network. Only connections with Pz < 0.0001 were
retained to simplify the networks. For PO calculation, more
information was needed for association analysis. Thus,
we used a threshold of Pz < 0.01. If the threshold of the
connections was changed to Pz < 0.001, all the 11 proteins
with more than 70 connections were associated with the
cell lines (PO < 0.03). The results proved the capability of
our algorithm for deep data mining. That is, the association
score was deduced with large numbers of weak similarities
between the active compounds of the cell lines and the
proteins instead of fewer but stronger similarities.
We also analyzed two sub-networks (Figure 2C’,
2C”) extracted from the interaction network of MCF7
active compounds and the proteins (Figure 2C). Figure 2C’
shows the predicted interactions between a MCF7 active
compound (NCI_ID 727680) and 7 proteins, while
Figure 2C” shows the interactions between a BindingDB
protein (Uniprot_ID P05227) and 17 anticancer

compounds for the MCF7 cell line. Detailed information
about the subnetworks, including proteins, compounds
and PZ between them can be found in Supplementary
Table S1. Full information on PZ < 0.0001 data in MCF7
can be found in Table S2. We randomly selected 4 active
compounds (NCI_ID 353, 8591, 695939, 743862)
from these 17 anticancer compounds in Figure 2C’’ and
calculated the similarity between these NCI compounds
and the active compounds against the BindingDB proteins
(Uniprot_ID P05227). Most of the similarities were around
0.2, except very few high similarity scores (Supplementary
Table S3). This result is consistent with Keiser’s research,
which found that for most ligand pairs the similarity was
low, ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 [19]. This result also indicates
the necessity to use strict statistical algorithms in such
systems and confirms our previous deductions.

DISCUSSION
Prior methods for large-scale identification of
cancer-related genes or proteins were primarily based on
the discrepancies between the genomes of cancer cells and
normal cells, and rarely took into consideration ligandprotein interactions. Our research employed the activity
data of the chemicals targeting proteins or cancer cells in
existing databases, enabling us to analyze the mechanisms
underlying tumorigenesis from the perspective of
chemistry. A chemoinformatics approach (TL-SEA) was

proposed to compare anticancer compounds with active
chemicals binding to a particular protein target. By this
means, possible associations between cancer cell lines and
proteins were predicted if the two groups of chemicals
showed similarity. Literature searches showed that most
of the high-ranked proteins were related to proliferation,
apoptosis, or differentiation of cancer cells.
Additionally, a chemical-protein interaction matrix
was produced, which can help explain the mechanism
of the anticancer drugs and also boost the repurposing of
anticancer drugs to other fields. In fact, the drugs active
against the predicted proteins are also potential active
compounds against cancer. This can be quantitatively
measured using the TL-SEA algorithm in reverse, to
calculate the association between active compounds against
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the predicted protein targets and NCI cell lines. The above
results confirmed the effectiveness of our algorithm. Of
course, further laboratory experiments are needed to validate
the predicted associations/interactions. Pathway analysis
and systems biology simulation can also be performed to
interpret the roles of the proteins in tumorigenesis.
The applications of this chemoinformatics approach
can be expanded to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
of other diseases. For instance, by comparing the active
compounds against a bacterium with those targeting a
variety of proteins, it is possible to deduce important
proteins for the growth of this bacterium. The primary
mission in the post-genomic era is to illuminate the
relationships among genes, proteins, diseases, pathways and
chemicals at an -omics level. It is impossible to finish this

work using traditional methods. Currently, a large number
of small molecule activity data are becoming available to
the public, such as ChEMBL and Pubchem [51, 52]. These
datasets include the results of high throughput screening at
the molecular level and all kinds of phenotypic activity. The
relationship between the phenotypes (diseases) and proteins
can be inferred using the TL-SEA algorithm proposed here.
Compared with traditional approaches, our approach
is economically feasible and fast, and therefore suitable
for rapid preliminary screening before further validation.
Compared with conventional genome correlation analysis,
TL-SEA utilizes the activity data directly, reflecting
protein function in the organism. Thus, the results of
TL- SEA can be interpreted more easily with pathway
analysis. However, the limitations of this approach should
not be ignored. The method relies on the activity data
of small molecules and only applies to the diseases or
proteins whose active molecules are known.

General study protocol
The overall protocol of this study is illustrated in
Figure 3. Activity data and structures of small molecules
against cancer cell lines and against a variety of proteins
were collected from the NCI database and BindingDB.
Physicochemical properties and activity thresholds were
used to filter off inactive or non-druglike compounds. Then
the similarity matrix (target similarity matrix) formed by
these two groups of active compounds was calculated with
ECFP_4 molecular fingerprint and the Tanimoto coefficient.
At the same time, large numbers of chemicals satisfying
aforementioned physicochemical properties were randomly
sampled from BindingDB. The similarity matrix (random
similarity matrix) formed by these random BindingDB
chemicals and the NCI active compounds of the corresponding

cell line was also calculated in the same manner. Finally,
the TL-SEA algorithm was employed to compare the target
similarity matrix with the random similarity matrix, and
therefore give the association score (AS) between each protein
and the cell line. The AS score was used to infer whether a
given protein plays a role in the growth of cancer cells. Details
about the association algorithm are described below.

Activity data sets of K562, MCF7, and A549 cell
lines contained 47,497; 36,801; and 51,170 entries,
respectively. 2D structures of the corresponding active
compounds were extracted and linked with the activity
values. The distribution of compounds’ GI50 values,
ranging from micromole to nanomole, was analyzed
with the cumulative frequency plot (Supplementary
Figure S2). 90% of the active compounds possessed
a pGI50 (the negative logarithm of GI50 values in
base 10) less than 6 (GI50  ≥  10–6  mol/L). Therefore,
compounds with pGI50 over 6 were defined as active,
which included 3658, 3744 and 4646 compounds in the
three data sets, respectively. Inactive compounds were
discarded.
The distributions of molecular weight and AlogP
(oil water distribution coefficient) of the anticancer active
compounds were compared and analyzed (Supplementary
Figure S3). AlogP thresholds were set to [2, 7], [–3, 8],
and [–3, 8] for the three cell lines, respectively. Molecular
weight thresholds were set to [150, 750], [200,800],
and [200,800]. After property filtering, 3160, 3362, and
4150 anticancer active compounds were retained for the
following analysis.

NCI database
Activity and structural data of cancer cell line
inhibitors were downloaded from NCI website (https://wiki.
nci.nih.gov/display/NCIDTPdata/Chemical+Data). NCI
database uses GI50 (growth inhibition of 50%) as an
endpoint, which is the drug concentration giving a 50%
reduction in the cancer cell proliferation. According to the
distribution of GI50 value of the cell lines, leukemia cell
lines were generally more sensitive than other cell lines.
Therefore, K562 leukemia cells (September 2012 release)
were selected as the study material and its activity data were
used for the next analysis. We also selected two other cancer
cell lines, MCF7 and A549 (September 2014 release), to
confirm the stability and effectiveness of our algorithm. The
three cancer cell lines were analyzed separately.

BindingDB database

Generation of the similarity matrices

Active data against proteins were obtained from
BindingDB (http://bindingdb.org/bind/index.jsp, accessed
on 2 March 2014). The binding data and 2D structures
of small molecules were collected. There were four
types of endpoints used in BindingDB, i.e. Ki, IC50, Kd
and EC50. Compounds were defined as active when any
of these values were smaller than 10–6  mol/L. To ensure
the consistency of physical and chemical properties,
BindingDB compounds were also filtered with the
property criteria as discussed above. The final BindingDB
active ligand set contained 505,600 compounds.

A similarity matrix (M) was generated by calculating
the similarities between the NCI and BindingDB active
compounds. Each column of the matrix corresponds to
a NCI active compound, while each row corresponds
to a BindingDB active compound. The similarity was
calculated with ECFP_4  molecular fingerprint and
Tanimoto coefficient. ECFP is Extended-Connectivity
Fingerprints based on the Morgan algorithm [78]. It is
a circular topological fingerprint designed for molecular
characterization, similarity calculation, and virtual
screening. The diameter of a circular atom neighborhood

Figure 4: Schematic representation of the TL-SEA algorithm. First, the target protein similarity matrix (Mt) was extracted from

the overall NCI-BindingDB similarity matrix (M). Then, the matrix was translated into an initial score vector. Next, the initial score vector
was normalized to the Z score vector through random column sampling. Finally, the association score (AS) was calculated based on the Z
score vector and another random sampling of random similarity matrixes. Here, n is the number of the active compounds of a NCI cell line.
S and S’ are the similarity value between NCI compound and BindingDB compound. I is the sum of the similarity values over 0.15 in the
corresponding column. Refer to the text for a detailed description.

is set to 4. Tanimoto coefficient (St) is one of the most
widely used similarity indices and is defined as St = C/
(A + B – C). Here, A and B are the numbers of fingerprint
bits of molecules A and B, and C is the number of bits
coexisting in both molecules.
As background sampling, around 50,000 compounds
were randomly selected from BindingDB. The compounds
were filtered using physicochemical properties as described
above. Similarity matrices of the randomly selected
BindingDB compounds against all NCI active compounds
of each cell line (Mr) were also calculated. Three random
compound sets (similarity matrices) were prepared with
different property thresholds for the three NCI cell lines.

The initial score reflected the association between
each protein and the corresponding anticancer compound.
However, the initial score varied when the number of
active compounds changed. For proteins with more active
compounds, their initial scores were generally higher than
proteins with less active compounds. Therefore, the initial
score was translated into a comparable standardized score
(Z) and significance score (PZ). This was achieved with
row sampling and linear regression.
a) Random sampling was conducted against all
columns in the random similarity matrix (Mr). For each
randomly selected column, the sampling was performed
with 2000 different lengths (m). The lengths were
randomly selected from 1 to 10,000. The operation was
repeated for 5000 times, which produced 10 million
random compound sets.
b) As we did in step 2, for each sampling, an
initial score vector was obtained by summing up the
similarity values larger than the threshold (0.15). Then,
the distribution of the initial score over different sampling
length (m) was obtained through analysis of the 10 million
similarity sets (2000 × 5000). Here we used the same
protocol to Keiser’s [19]. First, by fitting the distribution
pattern over sampling length with the following equations,
constants (a, b and k) were obtained.

Calculating association scores using the TL-SEA
algorithm
The similarity between two unrelated compound
sets was usually very weak. Therefore, a sensitive
association recognition algorithm with careful statistical
inference was required to predict cancer-related proteins.
This algorithm needed to be able to find out the implicit
association of cancer cells with particular proteins using
their active molecules. Based on the SEA algorithm, which
was originally proposed by Keiser [19], we proposed an
improved two-layer approach (TL-SEA). The protocol of
this algorithm is described as follows (Figure 4).
Extract the row vectors corresponding to a BindingDB
protein active set

µm= k × m (2)

To analyze the association between the NCI cell
line and a certain protein, the row similarity vectors
corresponding to the protein’s active compounds were
extracted from M. The extracted row vectors composed
a target sub-matrix (Mt). Proteins with less than 10 active
compounds (vectors) were discarded.

σ m = a × mb 

Here, μm and σm are the mean and the standard
deviation of I in each group with sampling length m. a,
b, k are the constants of the distribution of I in different
length m. Then, a standardized score (Z) for each initial
score was calculated with the following formula:

Translate the similarity matrix Mt into an initial score
(I) vector by adding up all the similarity values over a
threshold in each column

ˆ
Z = ( I − kˆ × m ) / (aˆ × mb ) (4)

Here, â, b̂ , k̂ , are the estimated values for a,
b and k. The standardized score (Z) was comparable
between proteins with different numbers of active
compounds. Finally, the standard score was translated into
a significance score (PZ) with the formula,

The frequency histograms of the random similarity
values (in Mr) were analyzed and shown in Supplementary
Figure S4. By analyzing the distribution of random
similarity values in the random similarity matrices, we
chose 0.15 as the threshold and used it to filter off weak
similarity noise.
Then, by summing up all the similarity values
over 0.15 in each column (NCI active compound i), the
similarity matrix (Mt) was translated in to a row vector.
The element of the vector was defined as the initial
score (I) between the protein and a particular anticancer
compound.

Ii =
ΣS ji ( S ji > 0.15)



=
PZ N ( Z r ≥ Z i ) / N ( Z r ) (5)
Here, N(Zr) is the total number of Z scores of
the random sampling, which is equal to 107. Zi is
the standardized score of the th column in the target
similarity matrix of protein (Mt). N(Zr ≥ Zi) is the number
of Zr which exceeds or equal Zi. PZ is the statistical
significance of the ith column, which is equal to the
probability of getting a Z score no smaller than Zi from
random sampling. Therefore, the association between a
cell line active compound and a certain protein can be
estimated with PZ.

Here, the summation was made over all the
similarities between the active compounds against the
protein (j) and the anticancer compound.

Translate the standardized score (Z) vector into the
association score (PO)

network. The network was graphically presented, rendered
with Cytoscape [79] (version 2.8.2) by Force-Directed
BioLayout. The edge was weighted by the reciprocal of
the negative of the common logarithm of PZ.

In the above steps, we compared the active
compounds against specific proteins and each cell lines
active compounds, producing the Z score rating the
relationship of this protein to every anticancer compound.
To analyze the association between the protein and the cell
line, the Z score vectors were merged into a comparable
association score based on random row sampling.
First, a threshold (c) of Z corresponding to an
acceptable confidence level (probability PZ = 0.01) was
determined. By summing up the Z values not less than c,
the original association score (O) of a certain protein was
obtained.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Then, random rows were extracted from the
random similarity matrix (Mr). Similarly to the last step,
the matrix sampling was performed with 2000 different
numbers and repeated for 5000 times for each number.
This sampling formed 10 million sub-matrices in total. For
each matrix, the initial score and Z score of each column
were calculated as previously described. And, the original
score (Or) of random selected compounds was calculated.
There were 10 million Or values in total.
Because every original score (O) was calculated in
the same length that was equal to the number of active
compounds against the cell line, it was unnecessary to
standardize this value. The significance of the original
score, here defined as the association score (AS score, PO),
was calculated as the probability of getting an random Or
that is not less than O score in random sampling.

Protein-compound association networks
During the process of AS score (PO) calculation,
a P-value (PZ) matrix between the NCI compounds and
the BindingDB proteins was formed. For matrix elements
with very low PZ value, there was a great chance that the
corresponding NCI compound and the protein can bind
to each other. To illustrate the relationships between NCI
chemicals and BindingDB proteins clearly, we retained
the matrix elements with PZ lower than 0.0001 and
converted the matrix into a chemical-protein interaction
