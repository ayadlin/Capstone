BACKGROUND. Bexarotene is one of the most active single agents for the treatment
of recurring or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Interferon alfa has
also been used for many years as an effective treatment for this disease. The results
in recent case reports of the combination of bexarotene and interferon alfa have
been promising. Based on more extensive results reported with the combination of
other retinoids with interferon alfa, the present study attempted to determine the
response rate, response duration, and safety of bexarotene (Targretin capsules,
Ligand Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, Calif) alone and then with the addition of inter-

was not seen after 8 weeks, interferon alfa-2b 3 million units (MU) subcutaneously
was added, and increased to 5 MU if tolerated, 3 times a week.

clinical complete response, 6 patients with partial response, 3 patients with stable
disease, and 8 patients with progressive disease. Three partial responses were first

utaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are lymphoproliferative Tcell disorders that are heterogeneous in their presentation, disease course, and prognosis, and are difficult to cure. Limited disease
may have a chronic indolent course, but advanced disease may
have an aggressive course with a fatal outcome. Patients frequently
die from infection due to their immunosuppression and compromised skin barrier.1
The pathogenesis of CTCL is not completely understood but an
alteration in the homing of T-cells to the skin and lack of normal
cell cycle differentiation and apoptosis of T-cells are commonly
seen. As CTCL progresses, clonal CD4 T-cells produce increased
Type 2 (Th2) cytokines and the production of Type 1 (Th1) helper
T-cell cytokines decreases, resulting in decreased cell-mediated
cytotoxicity.2 Therapy is increasingly directed at correcting these
cytokine imbalances.3–5

The combined use of retinoids and interferons
has been studied in CTCL because of their complementary immunomodulating effects and their nonoverlapping toxicity profiles.6–9 Retinoids induce IL-12
production, which results in enhanced Th1 activity,
whereas the use of interferon alpha/gamma inhibits
Th2 cytokine production.10 Additionally, interferon
and retinoids may have synergistic antiangiogenic
properties, and both may induce antiproliferative
genes.5
The discovery of a subclass of retinoid receptors,
retinoid X receptor (RXR, a, b, and g), led to the development of the RXR agonist bexarotene (Targretin,
Ligand Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, Calif). RXRs are
members of a superfamily of nuclear receptors that
are crucial for gene transcription.11–13 In addition, it
has been shown in vitro and in vivo that bexarotene
can cause apoptosis of malignant cells.14–16
Interferon alfa acts through multiple mechanisms, including binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface and stimulating suppression
of cellular proliferation and the phagocytic activity of
macrophages. In initial trials with doses up to 36 MU
daily or 50 MU 3 times weekly the objective response
rates were 45% and 64%, respectively. However, the
adverse events at these doses limit its usefulness.
The more commonly accepted dose begins at 3 MU
3 times a week (TIW) with gradual increases up to a
maximum of 18 MU daily, if tolerated. At these
higher doses, published response rates range from
50% to 80%, but with significant side effects.
Combination therapy is commonly used in the
treatment of CTCL. There are reports of additive benefits from combinations of interferon alfa and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) retinoids7–9 and, more
recently, published case reports and patient series
have reported treatment success when bexarotene is
used concomitantly with interferon alfa or interferon
gamma. This study was undertaken to further explore
the synergistic effects of bexarotene and interferon
alfa in patients with advanced CTCL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Main inclusion criteria for this study included
biopsy-confirmed CTCL (TNM stage IB, IIA, IIB-IV)
within 6 weeks of enrollment; measurable and assessable disease; Karnofsky performance status 60;
acceptable hematologic, renal, and liver function;
fasting serum triglyceride within normal limits or
normalized before study entry; no serious intercurrent illness or infection; and a negative pregnancy
test within 7 days of study entry. Patients were not

eligible for this study if they had received vitamin A
in doses greater than 15,000 IU or another retinoid
within 30 days of study entry, participated in another
investigational study within 30 days, were pregnant
or breast-feeding or intended to become pregnant or
were unwilling to use adequate contraception to
avoid pregnancy, had a history of pancreatitis, were
unwilling or unable to avoid prolonged UV light exposure, or had a known allergy or sensitivity to interferon alfa-2b or to bexarotene. Patients gave written
informed consent before participating in this trial.

Trial Design
This was a multicenter, open-label Phase II trial with
planned patient enrollment up to 45 patients.
Informed consent was obtained from patients before
treatment and the study protocol was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of each participating
center. At baseline, patient history, physician examination skin score determination, and Karnofsky
performance status were determined.
Patients had laboratory evaluation every 14 days
including T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH),
and fasting triglycerides. Women must have had a
negative beta-HCG pregnancy test 7 days before study
entry, and computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen, and pelvis was required for patients with stage
IV disease (TNM).
Eligible patients received bexarotene 300 mg/m2/
day orally for 8 weeks. If a complete response (CR)
was achieved, then bexarotene therapy was continued as monotherapy for a total of 16 weeks or longer
until patients progressed or experienced recurrence.
If patients had a partial response, stable disease, or
no response after 8 weeks of bexarotene, then interferon alfa-2b (IFN) 3 MU subcutaneously TIW
(Monday, Wednesday, Friday) was added. After 1
week the dose of IFN was increased to 5 MU TIW if
the patient had no grade 3 or 4 toxicity on the 3 MU
dose. If patients progressed on bexarotene before 8
weeks they could be started on IFN at that time and
the combination therapy continued for a total of 16
weeks.
The planned duration of treatment was 16
weeks; however, responding patients could continue
beyond 16 weeks and continue to have monthly tumor assessments. All patients were given a lipid-lowering agent such as fenofibrate or atorvastatin as
hyperlipidemia prophylaxis.

Statistical Analysis
The Simon 2-stage optimal design was used in this
study. Under this design 45 patients are required.

Targretin and Intron-A in CTCL/Straus et al.

The trial would stop if 9 or fewer responses were
seen in the first 20 patients. Otherwise, the trial
would continue until 45 patients were accrued, and
the treatment would be considered promising if at
least 25 major responses were seen among the 45
patients. Based on this 2-stage design, the probability
of completing the study and declaring the new combination effective is 10% when the true probability of
response rate is 45%. The primary endpoint criteria
(PEC) were used as the criteria for response.

Assessments
The study endpoints were a major response including partial response (PR), clinical complete response
(CCR), or a CR according to the PEC. CCR refers to
complete disappearance of all measurable disease in
the skin and elsewhere without a confirmatory negative skin biopsy. If the confirmatory skin biopsy is
negative, the response is CR. The PEC was defined as
the best response by either the Physician’s Global
Assessment of Clinical Condition (PGA) or the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity
(CA), as defined in the protocol. These are the same
criteria as used in the trials that led to FDA approval
of bexarotene and have been described in detail.17,18
The PGA allows the investigator to assess the
overall extent of improvement or worsening in the
patient’s overall disease. The assessment evaluates
index and nonindex cutaneous lesions, clinically
abnormal lymph nodes, cutaneous tumors, and any
other manifestation of CTCL. Confirmation of a
response requires confirmation over 2 or more observations over at least 4 study weeks.
The CA is the second assessment tool and evaluates 5 index lesions on a scale of 0–8 for scaling, erythema, plaque/tumor elevation, and hypo/
hyperpigmentation.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics are described in Table 1.
Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study. The
median age was 57 years (range, 22–79 years). There
were 9 males and 13 females. Four patients had previously received systemic chemotherapy and 18 topical chemotherapy. Twelve patients had previously
been treated with total skin electron beam chemotherapy. One patient was previously untreated. Three
patients were stage IB, 7 patients stage II, 4 patients
stage III, and 8 patients stage IV.
Nineteen patients completed the first 8 weeks of
bexarotene alone and 18 patients completed the full
16 weeks of bexarotene, with the addition of 8 weeks
of interferon. The overall response rate was 39%

(95% confidence interval [CI]: 17%–64%) with 1 CCR
in a patient with refractory stage IB CTCL, 6 partial
responses (stages IB [1 patient], IIA [1 patient], III [1
patient], IV [3 patients]), 3 patients with stable disease, and progressive disease in 8 patients (stages II
[3 patients], III [2 patients], IV [3 patients]). The initial stages of those patients who progressed were 3
patients stage II, 2 patients stage III, and 3 patients
stage IV. Median duration of response was 2.7
months, with a range of 1.1 to 7.6 months.
During the first 8 weeks of treatment with bexarotene alone, no patient had a complete remission;
however, 3 patients achieved a PR, 3 patients had
stable disease, and 13 patients progressed. One
patient with a PR did not continue on to interferon
treatment and progressed slightly after more than 1
month of response. Four additional responses were
seen during Weeks 9–16 with the addition of interferon to bexarotene. The patient who achieved a CCR
on bexarotene and interferon previously achieved a
PR on bexarotene alone.
All patients except for 1 patient with stage III
disease had recurrence or were refractory to prior
therapies. The mean time from initial diagnosis to
study enrollment was 49 months. Four patients had
received prior bexarotene and 2 patients had received
prior interferon.
Four patients did not complete 16 weeks due to
early death of 1 patient, noncompliance in 1, withdrawal of consent due to side effects in 1, and nontreatment-related myocarditis in 1 patient. The trial
was stopped because only 7 responses were seen in
the first 19 patients (at least 10 of 20 were required).

ANC indicates absolute neutrophil count; SGOT (AST), aspartate aminotransferase; SGPT (ALT),
alanine aminotransferase.

Safety
Grade 3 and 4 adverse events are described in Table 2.
Reversible grade 3 or 4 toxicities seen in more than 1
patient were hypercholesterolemia (2 patients), hypertriglyceridemia (4 patients), neutropenia (3 patients),
lymphopenia (2 patients), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 2 patients).
Lipid-lowering agents (LLA) were used prophylactically in all patients: atorvastatin or fenofibrate.
Management of grade 3 and 4 hypertriglyceridemia
was achieved using maximum doses of LLA and dose
modifications of bexarotene. Six patients died (stages
IB [1 patient], IIB [1 patient], III [1 patient], IV [3
patients]), all of progressive disease from 1.6 to 29.9
months after initiation of study therapy.

DISCUSSION
Until recently, lack of consistent criteria for response
assessment has been a major problem in the interpretation of reports of treatment response in patients
with CTCL. Response of skin lesions to treatment is
more difficult to quantify than that of most tumors
or leukemias, and there are no standardized criteria.
The pivotal trials of bexarotene capsules and the
immunotoxin, denileukin diftitox, reported results
using more objective reproducible dermatologic cri-

teria than previously employed.17–19 Using these criteria, a major response rate (CR, PR) of 45% to 54%
was reported for bexarotene capsules in patients
with recurring or refractory CTCL. The optimal dose
was 300 mg/m2. This study employed the same efficacy criteria as previously used for the bexarotene
capsule trials and the results in this trial should
therefore be comparable to those reported for bexarotene capsules alone, if other variables, such as
disease stage, number of prior therapies, and bexarotene dose are similar.
An example of the difficulty of interpreting the
older literature is the early studies with interferon
alfa in CTCL. These studies used high doses of 36 to
50 million IU daily or 3 times weekly (maximum tolerated dose, 18 million IU daily) with objective
response rates of 45% and 64% with considerable
toxicity.20 At lower interferon doses, side effects were
less severe, although the response rates were also
lower. The best interferon dose is not completely
established; however, the dose of 3 MU, increased to
5 MU TIW is commonly used.
Several studies have been reported with a combination of interferon alfa and various retinoids. Small
trials demonstrated major responses with interferon
alfa combined with either isotretinoin6,21 or with
etretinate.7,8,22 Stadler et al.9 documented a major
response rate of 59.5% (38.1% complete and 21.4%
partial) among 42 patients with stages I or II CTCL
with interferon alfa and acitretin, the active metabolite of etretinate. The toxicity profile of bexarotene
is favorable as compared with isotretinoin and
etretinate.23,24
In the present study, 3 of 7 responses occurred
with bexarotene alone at Week 8. However, a higher
response rate with bexarotene alone might have
been seen if the period of monotherapy had been
extended beyond 8 weeks before the addition of
interferon alfa. In the registration trial of bexarotene
for patients with refractory advanced CTCL the median time to response was 25.7 weeks (range, 14–169
days) at a dose of 300 mg/m2/day.17 With high doses
of interferon alfa, responses are seen within 1 month,
although whether or not responses are slower at
lower doses has not been reported.
Published case reports using low-dose bexarotene and interferon alfa have seen patient partial
responses as early as 1 month or up to 6 months after starting the combination.5,25 The combination of
bexarotene and interferon alfa in Sézary syndrome
patients usually includes extracorporeal photopheresis and may take up to 6 months to achieve a
response. Thus, it is possible that higher response
rates might have been seen if the period of com-

Targretin and Intron-A in CTCL/Straus et al.

bined therapy was extended beyond the second 8week period or if both agents were used concomitantly from the beginning of therapy.
An additive or synergistic effect of interferon to
the responses seen with bexarotene alone cannot be
completely ruled out. However, the response rate seen
in this trial is similar to that reported for bexarotene
alone in CTCL. The clinical usefulness of this combination is limited by the inconvenience of interferon
injections and the somatic side effects of interferon.
