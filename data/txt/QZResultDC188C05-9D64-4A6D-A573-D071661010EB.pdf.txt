Abstract

Author Manuscript

Patients with HER2 positive breast cancer often exhibit intrinsic or acquired resistance to
trastuzumab treatment. The transmembrane MUC1-C oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in
breast cancer cells and associates with HER2. The present studies demonstrate that silencing
MUC1-C in HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 and BT474 breast cancer cells results in
downregulation of constitutive HER2 activation. Moreover, treatment with the MUC1-C inhibitor,
GO-203, was associated with disruption of MUC1-C/HER2 complexes and decreases in tyrosine
phosphorylated HER2 (p-HER2) levels. In studies of trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3R and BT474R
cells, we found that the association between MUC1-C and HER2 is markedly increased (~20-fold)
as compared to that in sensitive cells. Additionally, silencing MUC1-C in the trastuzumabresistant cells or treatment with GO-203 decreased p-HER2 and AKT activation. Moreover,
targeting MUC1-C was associated with downregulation of phospho-p27 and cyclin E, which
confer trastuzumab resistance. Consistent with these results, targeting MUC1-C inhibited the
growth and clonogenic survival of both trastuzumab-resistant cells. Our results further
demonstrate that silencing MUC1-C reverses resistance to trastuzumab and that the combination
of GO-203 and trastuzumab is highly synergistic. These findings indicate that MUC1-C
contributes to constitutive activation of the HER2 pathway and that targeting MUC1-C represents
a potential approach to abrogate trastuzumab resistance.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The HER2/ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is overexpressed in approximately 20%
of human breast cancers and is associated with aggressive disease and poor survival (1; 2).
HER2 forms heterodimers with HER3 and thereby phosphorylates and activates HER3 (3;
4). Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the HER2 extracellular
domain and destabilizes ligand-independent HER2/HER3 complexes (5). Targeting of
HER2 with trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells also decreases HER2
levels (6; 7) and induces G1 arrest by stabilizing the CDK inhibitor p27 (8). Trastuzumab
extends the overall survival of certain patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancers
when used as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy (9–11). However, many
patients exhibit de novo unresponsiveness to trastuzumab or develop acquired resistance
after treatment (11). Trastuzumab resistance has been associated with constitutive activation
of the PI3K pathway as a result of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deficiency (12)
or PIK3CA gene mutations (13). PTEN has also been linked to SRC activation and thereby
trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer cells and in breast tumors (14). Additional
mechanisms of resistance have included expression of a truncated p95HER2 that lacks the
trastuzumab binding domain (15), heterodimerization with other RTKs (16–18) and
downregulation of HER2 expression (19). Other studies have shown that resistance of
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells to trastuzumab is conferred by (i) upregulation of
cyclin E and an increase in CDK2 activity (20), and (ii) decreased expression of the PPM1H
phosphatase that regulates stability of the CDK inhibitor p27 (21; 22). These findings have
provided the experimental basis for designing strategies that target pathways associated with
trastuzumab resistance to reverse unresponsiveness to this agent.

MUC1 is a heterodimeric protein that associates with HER2 at the surface of breast cancer
cells (23; 24). MUC1 is translated as a single polypeptide that undergoes autocleavage into
N-terminal (MUC1-N) and C-terminal (MUC1-C) fragments, which in turn form a stable
complex at the cell membrane (25; 24). The MUC1-N/MUC1-C heterodimer is positioned at
the apical border of breast epithelial cells and is sequestered from RTKs that are expressed
at the baso-lateral membranes (25; 24). However, with loss of apical-basal polarity as a
result of stress or transformation, MUC1 is repositioned over the entire cell membrane and
interacts with RTKs such as HER2 (23; 25; 24). MUC1-N, the mucin component of the
heterodimer, is shed from the cell surface (25; 24). The MUC1-C subunit spans the cell
membrane and includes a 58 amino acid (aa) extracellular domain, a 28 aa transmembrane
domain and a 72 aa cytoplasmic domain. MUC1-C associates in part with RTKs through
extracellular galectin-3 bridges (26). In addition, the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain
functions as a substrate for phosphorylation by RTKs and SRC (25; 24). The MUC1-C
cytoplasmic domain also contains a YHPM motif that, when phosphorylated on tyrosine,
functions as a binding site for PI3K p85 SH2 domains (27). These findings and the
demonstration that MUC1-C overexpression is sufficient to induce anchorage-independent
growth and tumorigenicity (28; 29) provided the basis for developing agents that block the
MUC1-C transforming function (25). In this way, the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain
contains a CQC motif that is necessary for its homodimerization and function (30). Notably,
cell-penetrating peptides that bind to the MUC1-C CQC motif are effective in inhibiting

growth and inducing death of human breast cancer cells growing in vitro and as xenografts
in mice (31). However, the effects of MUC1-C inhibition on (i) the interaction between
MUC1-C and HER2, and (ii) HER2 signaling in breast cancer cells are not known.
The present studies demonstrate that MUC1-C contributes to HER2 activation in HER2overexpressing breast cancer cells and thereby promotes their growth and clonogenic
survival. The results also demonstrate that the formation of MUC1-C/HER2 complexes is
substantially increased in the setting of trastuzumab resistance and that targeting MUC1-C
in trastuzumab-resistant cells results in downregulation of HER2 activation. In concert with
these findings, we show that targeting MUC1-C is effective in reversing trastuzumab
resistance.

Silencing MUC1-C suppresses HER2 activation

Author Manuscript

MUC1 associates with HER2 in non-HER2-amplified breast cancer cells and this interaction
is increased by heregulin stimulation (23). However, the functional significance of the
MUC1-C/HER2 interaction has remained unclear. Accordingly, studies were performed on
SKBR3 and BT474 breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2 and are dependent on pHER2 for growth and survival (3). Levels of HER2 and MUC1-C were found to be similar
in these cells (Fig. 1A). Coimmunoprecipitation studies further demonstrated that MUC1-C
associates with HER2 in both SKBR3 and BT474 cells (Fig. 1B). To assess the potential
effects of MUC1-C on HER2 signaling, we stably silenced MUC1-C in SKBR3 cells (Fig.
1C, left). Notably, MUC1-C silencing was associated with downregulation of p-HER2, but
not HER2, abundance, consistent with a decrease in HER2 activation (Fig. 1C, left). In
concert with these results, silencing MUC1-C in BT474 cells similarly resulted in
suppression of p-HER2 levels (Fig. 1C, right). MUC1-C silencing was also associated with a
decrease in SKBR3 (Fig. 1D, left) and BT474 (Fig. 1D, right) cell growth. Moreover, colony
formation was substantially decreased by silencing MUC1-C expression in both SKBR3
(Fig. 1E, left) and BT474 (Fig. 1E, right) cells. These findings indicated that MUC1-C
contributes to HER2 activation and proliferation of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells.
The MUC1-C inhibitor, GO-203, downregulates HER2 phosphorylation

Author Manuscript

The 72 aa MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD) contains a CQC motif that is
necessary for its homodimerization (30; 32) (Fig. 2A). The results of pull-down studies
using lysates from SKBR3 cells demonstrated that MUC1-CD is sufficient for forming
complexes with HER2 (Fig. 2A, left). However, binding to HER2 was not detectable with
MUC1-CD in which the CQC motif had been mutated to AQA (Fig. 2A, left). Similar
results were obtained when pull-down experiments were performed with lysates from
BT474 cells (Fig. 2A, right), indicating that the MUC1-C cysteine residues are of
importance for forming MUC1-C/HER2 complexes. GO-203 is a cell-penetrating peptide
that contains a poly-Arg cell transduction domain linked to CQCRRKN that binds to the
MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain at the CQC motif and thereby blocks MUC1-C
homodimerization (31; 27; 32) (Fig. 2B). Another cell-penetrating peptide, designated CP-2,

was synthesized in which the cysteine residues are altered to alanines, resulting in an
inactive control that does not inhibit MUC1-C homodimerization (31; 27; 32) (Fig. 2B).
Treatment of SKBR3 cells with GO-203 disrupted the interaction between MUC1-C and
HER2 (Fig. 2B, left). By contrast, CP-2 had no apparent effect on the abundance of MUC1C/HER2 complexes (Fig. 2B, left). GO-203, but not CP-2, also blocked the interaction
between MUC1-C and HER2 in BT474 cells (Fig. 2B, right). Analysis of p-HER2 levels
further demonstrated that GO-203, but not CP-2, decreases HER2 activation in SKBR3 cells
(Fig. 2C, left and right). BT474 cells also responded to GO-203, and not CP-2, exposure
with decreased HER2 activation (Fig. 2D). In concert with these results, GO-203 treatment
of SKBR3 (Fig. 2E) and BT474 (Fig. 2F) cells was associated with inhibition of growth.
These findings and those obtained with MUC1-C silencing provided support for the premise
that binding of MUC1-C and HER2 contributes to HER2 activation.

MUC1-C/HER2 complexes are upregulated in association with trastuzumab resistance
Trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3R cells were generated by chronic exposure to increasing
concentrations of trastuzumab for over 18 months in vitro (33). Thus, in contrast to parental
SKBR3 cells, growth of the resistant SKBR3R cells was not inhibited by exposure to 80 nM
trastuzumab (Fig. 3A). Levels of HER2 and MUC1-C were similar in SKBR3 and SKBR3R
cells (Fig. 3B). Strikingly, however, MUC1-C/HER2 complexes were 19-fold higher (as
determined by densitometric scanning of the signals) in the resistant SKBR3R cells (Fig.
3C). Analysis of trastuzumab-resistant BT474R cells (33) (Fig. 3D) also demonstrated
similar levels of MUC1-C and HER2 as compared to that in the sensitive BT474 cells (Fig.
3E). Moreover, BT474R cells exhibited a substantial increase (28-fold) in MUC1-C/HER2
complexes (Fig. 3F), indicating that the interaction between MUC1-C and HER2 is
increased in the setting of trastuzumab resistance.

Targeting MUC1-C suppresses HER2 activation in trastuzumab-resistant cells

Author Manuscript

As found in wild-type SKBR3 cells, stable silencing of MUC1-C in SKBR3R (Fig. 4A) and
BT474R (Fig. 4B) cells was associated with decreases in p-HER2 levels, indicating that
MUC1-C also contributes to HER2 activation in trastuzumab-resistant cells. Densitometric
scanning of the p-HER2 signals from multiple experiments demonstrated a decrease in pHER2 abundance of 74% and 45% in the SKBR3R and BT474R cells, respectively
(Supplemental Figs. S1A and S1B). In studies with SKBR3R cells, we found that treatment
with GO-203 is associated with disruption of MUC1-C/HER2 complexes (Fig. 4C). Similar
results were obtained when BT474R cells were treated with the MUC1-C inhibitor (Fig.
4D). GO-203 also suppressed HER2 activation in both SKBR3R (Fig. 4E) and BT474R
(Fig. 4F) cells. These results indicate that targeting MUC1-C with silencing or GO-203
treatment results in suppression of HER2 activation in trastuzumab-resistant cells.
Targeting MUC1-C suppresses HER3 phosphorylation
HER2 phosphorylates HER3 and disruption of the HER2/HER3 interaction is associated
with HER3 dephosphorylation (5). These findings and the demonstration that targeting
MUC1-C downregulates HER2 invoked the possibility that MUC1-C inhibition could also
affect HER3 activation. Indeed, silencing MUC1-C in SKBR3R and BT474R cells was

associated with decreases in p-HER3 levels (Fig. 5A, left and right). Scanning of the pHER3 signals from multiple experiments demonstrated a decrease in p-HER3 abundance of
55% and 52% in the SKBR3R and BT474R cells, respectively (Supplemental Figs. S1C and
S1D). HER3 is as crucial as HER2 in promoting proliferation of breast cancer cells that
overexpress HER2 (34). In that sense, the suppression of both phosphorylated HER2 (Figs.
4A and B) and HER3 (Fig. 5A) was associated with a marked decrease in colony formation
(Fig. 5B, left and right). GO-203 treatment of SKBR3R cells also suppressed p-HER3
abundance and activation of the downstream effector AKT (Fig. 5C). AKT phosphorylates
the CDK inhibitor p27 on T198 and thereby inactivates p27 by preventing its localization to
the nucleus (35; 36). In concert with the GO-203-induced decreases in AKT activation,
phosphorylation of p27 was also decreased in the absence of apparent changes in p27
abundance (Fig. 5C). Trastuzumab resistance is associated with increases in p27
phosphorylation (22) and upregulation of cyclin E (20). In addition to the decreases in
phospho-p27 levels, we also found that GO-203 treatment is associated with downregulation
of cyclin E abundance (Fig. 5C). Moreover, GO-203 treatment of SKBR3R cells was
associated with inhibition of growth (Fig. 5D). Similar effects of GO-203 treatment were
obtained in BT474R cells with decreases in phospho-p27 and cyclin E levels (Fig. 5E) and
an arrest of growth in vitro (Fig. 5F) and as tumor xenografts in nude mice (Fig. 5G). These
findings thus indicate that silencing MUC1-C or inhibition of MUC1-C with GO-203 results
in downregulation of HER3 activation and suppression of cell growth and survival.
Targeting MUC1-C with silencing or GO-203 treatment reverses trastuzumab resistance

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The demonstration that MUC1-C promotes HER2 signaling invoked the possibility that
targeting MUC1-C might affect the response to trastuzumab. In this context, analysis of
SKBR3R cells demonstrated that silencing MUC1-C is associated with increased sensitivity
to the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab (Fig. 6A). Trastuzumab resistance of
BT474R cells was also reversed in part by silencing MUC1-C (Fig. 6B), indicating that
targeting MUC1-C might be effective in combination with trastuzumab. To assess the
effects of combining GO-203 and trastuzumab, we first identified the IC50s for each agent
against SKBR3 and BT474 cells. In studies with SKBR3 cells, the IC50s for GO-203 and
trastuzumab were 5.9 μM and 93 nM, respectively (Supplemental Table 1A). Based on the
Chou-Talalay method, we then evaluated the effects of combining GO-203 and trastuzumab.
As shown in the dose-effect curves, treatment of SKBR3 cells with the combination was
more effective in inhibiting growth and survival than that obtained with either agent alone
(Fig. 6C, left). The median-effect analysis and calculation of the median dose (Dm) values
further showed a ~3-fold reduction in the Dm for GO-203 in the presence of trastuzumab as
compared to GO-203 alone (Fig. 6C, right). Calculation of the combination index (CI) at the
ED50, ED75 and ED90 for these agents demonstrated a high degree of synergy with the
values less than 1 (Supplemental Table 1B). Comparable results were obtained when BT474
cells were treated with GO-203 and trastuzumab as shown in the dose-effect curves
(Supplemental Fig. S2A, left) and the median-effect plots (Supplemental Fig. S2A, right),
and as supported by CI values ranging from 0.47 to 0.68 (Supplemental Table 1B). IC50s
for GO-203 were also generated for the SKBR3R and BT474R cells (Supplemental Table
1A). For these trastuzumab-resistant cells, there is no definable IC50 for trastuzumab
(Supplemental Table 1A); accordingly, we used the Bliss independence method for

assessing interactions between two agents when one of the agents is inactive (37; 38). As
expected, treatment with trastuzumab alone at 40 nM had no effect on SKBR3R cell growth.
However, GO-203 alone was effective in inhibiting growth, and combining GO-203 with 40
nM trastuzumab was more effective than either agent alone (Fig. 6D, left and right),
indicating that GO-203 reverses resistance to trastuzumab. An observed BI score of 0.84 as
compared to 0.46 for the predicted BI supported a synergistic interaction (Supplemental
Table 2). Based on these findings, we used the Chou-Talalay method to further analyze the
interaction between GO-203 and trastuzumab. Under these experimental conditions, we
confirmed that the combination of GO-203 and trastuzumab is synergistic in the treatment of
SKBR3R cells (Fig. 6E) with the CI<1 (Supplemental Table 1B). GO-203 was also highly
effective in combination with trastuzumab in the treatment of trastuzumab-resistant BT474R
cells using the BI (Supplemental Fig. S2B and Supplemental Table 2) and Chou-Talalay
(Supplemental Fig. S2C and Supplemental Table 1B) methods. These findings indicate that
GO-203 is synergistic with trastuzumab in the treatment of trastuzumab-resistant cells.
Effects of targeting MUC1-C on lapatinib treatment of trastuzumab-resistant cells

Author Manuscript

Lapatinib is a small molecule ATP competitor that inhibits phosphorylation of the HER2
intracellular kinase domain and has reported activity in trastuzumab-resistant cells (39–41;
7). In the present studies with SKBR3R cells, the combination of lapatinib and GO-203 was
more effective in inhibiting growth than lapatinib alone (Supplemental Fig. S3A, left and
right). Synergy between lapatinib and GO-203 was supported by an observed BI score of
0.85 as compared to 0.58 for the predicted BI (Supplemental Table 3). In addition, lapatinib
was synergistically active with GO-203 in inhibiting growth of BT474R cells (Supplemental
Fig. S3B, left and right; Supplemental Table 3). Based on these observations, we assessed
the effects of (i) lapatinib alone, (ii) lapatinib+trastuzumab, and (iii) lapatinib+trastuzumab
+GO-203. Using SKBR3R cells, the lapatinib+trastuzumab combination was not
significantly different in inhibiting growth as compared to lapatinib alone (Supplemental
Fig. S4A, left and right). However, the triple lapatinib+trastuzumab+GO-203 combination
was significantly more effective than lapatinib alone or lapatinib+trastuzumab
(Supplemental Fig. S4A, left and right) and as evidenced by an observed BI of 0.81
compared to a predicted BI of 0.59 (Supplemental Table 4). These findings with the
lapatinib+trastuzumab+GO-203 combination were further supported in studies of BT474R
cells (Supplemental Fig. S4B, left and right); Supplemental Table 4), indicating that GO-203
potentiates the effects of both lapatinib and trastuzumab in trastuzumab-resistant cells.

Discussion

MUC1-C is a previously unrecognized effector of HER2 activation
Previous work demonstrated that MUC1 associates with HER2 in the mammary glands of a
MUC1 transgenic mouse model and in human non-HER2-amplified breast cancer cell lines
(24). To define the functional significance of this association, the present studies were
performed on SKBR3 and BT474 breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2 and are
dependent on HER2 for proliferation (3). As anticipated, we found that MUC1-C associates
with HER2 in these HER2-overexpressing cells. Surprisingly, however, our results showed
that silencing MUC1-C is associated with downregulation of HER2 activation and loss of

clonogenic survival, supporting the contention that MUC1-C is of importance to HER2
signaling. The MUC1-C subunit includes a cytoplasmic domain that contains a CQC motif,
which is necessary for the formation of MUC1-C homodimers (30). Our results show that
the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to form complexes with HER2 and that this
association is abrogated by altering the CQC motif to AQA, indicating that MUC1-C
homodimerization is necessary for the MUC1-C/HER2 interaction. Cell membranepenetrating peptides, such as GO-203, block homodimerization of endogenous MUC1-C
through binding to the CQC motif (31; 32). The present results demonstrating that treatment
of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells with GO-203 blocks the interaction between
MUC1-C and HER2 provided further support for the premise that MUC1-C
homodimerization is necessary for forming complexes with HER2. In addition and as found
with MUC1-C silencing, targeting MUC1-C with GO-203 treatment was associated with
marked decreases in HER2 phosphorylation. Overexpression of HER2 in human breast
cancer cells facilitates the formation of HER2/HER3 heterodimers, activation of HER2 and
HER2-mediated phosphorylation of HER3 (4). The importance of HER3 in the HER2/HER3
heterodimer is supported by the demonstration that loss of HER3 function attenuates HER2mediated transformation (3). In addition to downregulation of HER2, we found that
targeting MUC1-C is associated with suppression of HER3 activation. These findings
support a previously unrecognized model in which MUC1-C homodimerization contributes
to HER2 activation and HER3 phosphorylation.
Targeting MUC1-C is a potential strategy for circumventing trastuzumab resistance

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancers frequently display primary
unresponsiveness or develop acquired resistance to trastuzumab therapy. Trastuzumab
resistance has been attributed to number of mechanisms, including activation of the PI3K
and SRC pathways (12; 13). Selection for growth of BT474 cells in the presence of
trastuzumab for 8 weeks has been associated with upregulation of MUC1 expression (42).
However, the present results show that the development of trastuzumab resistance over 18
months has little if any effect on MUC1-C abundance in SKBR3R and BT474R cells. The
basis for this discrepancy in findings is not clear. Nonetheless, the present results
demonstrate that trastuzumab resistance is associated with a substantial (~20-fold) increase
in the association of MUC1-C and HER2. Trastuzumab disrupts ligand-independent HER2/
HER3 interactions in HER2-overexpressing cells (5). Our results indicate that targeting
MUC1-C attenuates HER2 activation in trastuzumab-resistant cells. These findings raised
the possibility that MUC1-C may contribute to trastuzumab resistance by promoting HER2mediated signaling. Indeed, targeting MUC1-C was associated with downregulation of (i) pHER3 and p-AKT levels, and (ii) phosphorylation of p27, an AKT substrate. In addition,
targeting MUC1-C resulted in decreases in cyclin E abundance, a finding consistent with the
demonstration that cyclin E levels decrease upon HER2 inhibition (43). The downregulation
of p27 phosphorylation could also be linked to decreases in cyclin E expression as a result of
increased localization of p27 to the nucleus and thereby inhibition of CDK2, which in turn
results in cyclin E degradation (35; 36; 44). Further studies will be needed to address the
mechanistic basis for cyclin E downregulation in GO-203-treated trastuzumab-resistant
cells. Nonetheless, since both phospho-p27 and cyclin E have been linked to trastuzumab
resistance (21; 22; 20), we treated trastuzumab-resistant cells with GO-203 in combination

with trastuzumab. The observation that GO-203 and trastuzumab are highly synergistic
lends further support to the premise that MUC1-C contributes to the trastuzumab-resistant
phenotype by promoting HER2/HER3→AKT activation. These findings thus indicate that
targeting MUC1-C can reverse trastuzumab resistance. In addition, our results indicate that
GO-203 can potentiate the effects of lapatinib and the lapatinib+trastuzumab combination in
the SKBR3R and BT474R models. Translation of these findings with regard to the potential
effectiveness of combining GO-203 with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib in the clinic will
therefore require further study. In this respect, a Phase I trial of GO-203 is presently being
completed for patients with refractory solid tumors and, based on the present results, this
agent may be effective in combination with HER2 inhibitors in the setting of trastuzumabresistant breast cancer.
Why would MUC1-C contribute to HER2 signaling in breast cancer cells?

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Epithelia are single cell layers with apical-basal polarity that separate metazoans from the
external environment. As such, robust defense mechanisms emerged during evolution to
protect epithelial integrity. The mucins contribute in part to that defense by forming a
protective physical barrier (25). The MUC1-N subunit is shed from the epithelial cell
surface into this barrier as a first line of defense. In turn, the transmembrane MUC1-C
subunit functions in a subsequent line of defense by signaling stress to the interior of the
epithelial cell to promote repair, growth and survival (25). Importantly in this regard, the
response of epithelial cells to stress is associated with loss of apical-basal polarity and
activation of a HER2-mediated proliferation and survival program (45). With loss of
polarity, the apical MUC1-C protein is transiently repositioned over the cell membrane,
allowing it to interact with HER2, which is normally sequestered at the basolateral
membrane (25; 24). The present results provide evidence that, in associating with HER2,
MUC1-C contributes to HER2 activation and HER3 phosphorylation. Thus, a potential
advantage of this interaction with MUC1-C could conceivably be prolonged HER2/HER3
signaling in the absence of ligand. The epithelial stress response is reversible such that the
interaction between MUC1-C and HER2 is transient with return of epithelial cell polarity.
By contrast, in carcinoma cells with sustained activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, MUC1-C is positioned to constitutively interact with the HER2 complex and
promote activation of the HER2 pathway. In this way, breast cancer cells would appear to
have appropriated and subverted a physiologic stress response to support their own growth
and survival. Importantly, the interaction between MUC1-C and HER2 has been further
increased and subverted to circumvent the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab
treatment, such that targeting MUC1-C reverses trastuzumab resistance.

sterile apyrogen water (stock solution of 21 mg/ml) and stored at 4°C. Lapatinib (Selleck
Chemicals) was dissolved in DMSO. Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared as described (31). Soluble proteins were immunoprecipitated
with anti-MUC1-C (Ab5; Neomarkers) or a control IgG. The precipitates and lysates not
subjected to immunoprecipitation were immunoblotted with anti-MUC1-C, anti-β-actin
(Sigma-Aldrich), anti-p-HER2(Tyr1221/1222), anti-HER2, anti-p-HER3(Tyr1289), antiHER3, anti-p-AKT(S473), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p-p27(T198), antip27 and anti-cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reactivity was detected with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence.

In vitro binding assay
GST and GST-MUC1-CD fusion proteins were prepared and incubated with cell lysates as
described (27). Adsorbates to glutathione-conjugated beads were analyzed by
immunoblotting.
Colony formation assays
Cells were seeded on 6-well plates and incubated for 10–14 d. The cells were then washed
and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 25% methanol. Colonies >25 cells were counted in
triplicate wells.
Trastuzumab-resistant BT474R tumor xenograft model

Author Manuscript

Four- to 6-week-old BALB/c nu/nu female mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 107
BT474R cells in the flank. When tumors were ~80–100 mm3, the mice were pair-matched
into control and treatment groups of 8 mice each. PBS (control vehicle) or GO-203 at 7.5
mg/kg body weight were administered daily by intravenous injection for 21 days. Tumor
volumes were calculated as described (27).
Determination of IC50 and synergism

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded on 96-well plates in 100 μl of growth medium at a density of 3000 cells
per well. After 24 h, the cells were exposed to drugs in treatment medium for an additional
72 h. Cell viability was assessed using the alamar blue viability assay (Invitrogen).
Triplicate wells of each treatment were analyzed and each experiment was done three times.
The IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression of the dose-response data using
Prism 5.0 for Mac OSX (GraphPad Software). The presence or absence of synergism
between GO-203 and trastuzumab was determined by the method of Chou and Talalay (46;
47). Briefly, cells were exposed to 1:1 ratios of the respective IC50 values for GO-203 and
trastuzumab at (i) ¼ x IC50, (ii) ½ x IC50, (iii) IC50, (iv) 2 x IC50, and (v) 4 x IC50. Cell
viability was determined after treatment for 72 h. The combination index (CI) was
calculated to determine the presence of synergism (CI<1) or antagonism (CI>1) using
CalcuSyn software (Biosoft).

Assessment of drug interaction by Bliss independence

Author Manuscript

The Bliss independence (BI) model was also used to assess the interaction between GO-203
and trastuzumab in studies of trastuzumab-resistant cells. BI was determined using the
equation
(37; 38), where EA is the fractional inhibition for
GO-203 alone and EB is that for trastuzumab alone. Using this equation, if the
experimentally measured inhibition is greater than Ei, then the combination is synergistic
(38). Plots were generated by Prism GraphPad software.
