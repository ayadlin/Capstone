BACKGROUND: Central venous catheter (CVC) removal has often been recommended for the treatment of central
line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). However, CVC removal is not always practical in patients with cancer, and changing CVCs with noncoated CVCs over guidewire may result in cross-infection of the new CVC. Therefore,
the current matched retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of exchanging infected
CVCs for minocycline- and rifampin (MR)-coated CVCs in cancer patients with CLABSIs. METHODS: The authors identified all cancer patients with CLABSIs who had undergone either CVC exchange with MR-coated CVCs or CVC removal at the study institution. All patients were treated with appropriate systemic antibiotics. The exchange group
was matched in a 1:2 ratio with the removal group by organism, underlying disease, and neutropenia. The demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcome were compared. Overall response was defined as the resolution of clinical signs and symptoms and eradication of bacteremia within 72 hours after CVC exchange or removal, without
disease recurrence or infection-related death. RESULTS: A total of 120 cancer patients were included (40 in the
exchange group and 80 in the removal group). Overall response rates were 95% in the exchange group and 76% in
the removal group (P ¼ .011). No disease recurrences or infection-related deaths occurred in the exchange group; 8
disease recurrences or deaths (11%) occurred in the removal group (P ¼ .05). Patients in the exchange group also
experienced lower rates of mechanical failure (3% vs 15%; P ¼ .049). CONCLUSIONS: Exchanging CVCs for MR-coated
CVCs in cancer patients with CLABSIs may improve the overall response rate and decrease the risk of mechanical

Central venous catheters (CVCs) are essential in the treatment of patients with cancer, chronic diseases and critically

ill patients. However, they are the leading source of bloodstream infections.1 CVC removal has been recommended for
the treatment of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).2 However, in critically ill patients and patients
with cancer, CVC removal is not always possible, and changing CVCs over a guidewire with noncoated CVCs can result
in cross-infection of the newly exchanged CVCs.3 The insertion of a new CVC at a different site may be associated with serious mechanical complications such as pneumothorax and bleeding, especially in cancer patients with thrombocytopenia.4-6 In a large prospective randomized trial, the insertion of catheters in the subclavian vein was associated with a 9.7%
rate of mechanical complications that increased to 24% with >2 passes.6 Cobb et al indicated that exchanging catheters
with the use of a guidewire increases the risk of bloodstream infections; however, insertion of a catheter at a new site was
associated with more mechanical complications (5% in the insertion group vs 1% in the exchange group; P ¼ .005).4

Original Article

Multiple randomized controlled studies and metaanalyses have demonstrated that minocycline- and rifampin (MR)-coated catheters substantially decrease the risk
of CLABSIs.7-11 To the best of our knowledge, none of
the previous exchange studies used the MR-coated CVCs
to replace the infected CVCs in patients with bacteremia.
Hence, the risk of cross-infections with the newly
exchanged antimicrobial MR-coated catheters is
unknown. Therefore, in this matched retrospective cohort
study, we evaluated the effectiveness of exchanging
infected CVCs with MR-coated CVCs in cancer patients
with CLABSIs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Data
We searched the infection control surveillance database at
The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC) in Houston between July 2005 and July 2008
to identify all cancer patients who had developed CLABSIs. This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and a waiver of informed consent
was obtained.
We included all cancer patients aged 16 years in
whom an infected CVC had been exchanged for an MRcoated catheter over a guidewire. However, we excluded
all patients in whom MR-coated CVCs had been
inserted within 4 weeks before the CLABSI occurred.
We matched each exchange patient with 2 historical control cancer patients who had been diagnosed with CLABSIs between June 2004 and July 2008 and had
undergone removal of the infected CVC. Control
patients were also aged 16 years and were matched for
the same organisms, underlying disease (hematologic or
solid tumor), and neutropenic status as exchange cases.
Data were collected from the institutional electronic
medical records and included demographics, cancer
type, bacteremia date, organism, blood culture source
(CVC or peripheral vein), blood culture colony count,
time to positivity, CVC type, CVC insertion date and
site, number of lumens, CVC exchange or removal date,
clinical signs and symptoms, hospital admission and duration, intensive care unit admission, fever resolution
date, microbiologic eradication date, disease recurrence
within 3 months, complications, and death. We also
recorded the type and duration of antibiotic therapy.
Each patient was followed for 3 months from the date of
CVC exchange or removal or until death if it occurred
during the follow-up period.

2552

Definitions
CLABSIs were defined as per the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria.12,13 Patients
with intravascular catheters were considered to have a
CLABSI if they had at least 1 positive blood culture with a
recognized pathogen or 2 positive blood cultures with a
common skin contaminant in the presence of clinical
manifestations of infection and no apparent source for the
CLABSI except the catheter.13
Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil
count of <1000/lL. Severe neutropenia was defined as a
count of <500/lL.
Overall response was defined as the resolution of
clinical signs and symptoms and the eradication of bacteremia within 72 hours of CVC exchange or removal and
no evidence of 1) disease recurrence within the first 3
months; 2) related deep-seated infections occurring >1
week after exchange or removal and during follow-up; or
3) infection-related mortality.
Disease recurrence was defined as bacteremia recurrence with the same organism (similar species and antibiogram) after an initial clinical or microbiologic response to
antibiotics and within 3 months of CVC exchange or removal. Mechanical failure was defined as the inability to
insert a CVC at a different site, exchange a CVC over a
guidewire, or use a new CVC after the CLABSI, requiring
ultimate and definite removal of the CVC.
Infection-related complications were defined as the
occurrence of either disease recurrence, related deepseated infections occurring >1 week after exchange or removal and during follow-up, or infection-related death.
Appropriate antibiotic therapy represented the
administration of antibiotics approved for the treatment
of CLABSIs and active against the bacteria isolated as
causing the CLABSI based on hospital susceptibility
pattern.
Statistical Analysis
The chi-square or Fisher exact tests were used to compare
categorical variables, as appropriate. Continuous variables
were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests because of
the data’s deviation from normal distribution. In addition, survival analysis of late infection-related complications was performed. The patients were followed for 3
months after the catheter was exchanged or removed. The
probability of being free from late infection-related complications was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method
for those patients in whom the catheter was removed and
those in whom the catheter was exchanged, respectively,

and was compared by the log-rank test. Patients who died
during the follow-up period were considered to be censored observations. All tests were 2-sided and statistical
significance was set at P  .05. The statistical analyses
were performed using SAS statistical software (version
9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
During the study period, we observed 40 cancer patients
with CLABSIs who had their infected catheter exchanged
over a guidewire for an MR-coated CVC. These patients
were matched on the basis of organism, neutropenia, and
cancer type with 80 patients with CLABSIs who had their
CVC removed.
In the exchange group, there were 16 episodes of
gram-negative CLABSIs and 24 episodes of gram-positive
CLABSIs. The isolated micro-organisms causing the
CLABSIs are listed in Table 1. There was no significant
difference in the polymicrobial infection rate noted
between the groups (15% in the exchange group vs 8% in
the removal group; P ¼ .21) (Table 2).
The percentage of long-term and short-term catheters used was similar in both groups (Table 3). There were
more peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC)
(basilic and cephalic locations) in the removal group. The
significant difference in catheter location is a by-product
of the finding that PICC lines once inserted are difficult
to exchange , although they could be easily removed and
inserted in a different location. The majority of the catheCancer

ters were double lumen in both groups; however, there
were more single-lumen catheters in the removal group
and more triple-lumen catheters in the exchange group
(Table 3).
The 2 groups were similar with regard to risk factors,
including sepsis at the time of presentation (Table 3). Despite trends that suggest that the control group was more
likely to be hospitalized in the intensive care unit (10%
for the exchange group vs 23% for the removal group;
P ¼ .1) and to be intubated (3% for the exchange group
vs 13% for the removal group; P ¼ .1), significantly more
patients in the exchange group had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation compared with those in
the control removal group (23% vs 8%; P ¼ .019) (Table
3). All patients had been treated with appropriate systemic
antibiotic therapy in addition to the exchange or removal
of the infected CVC. The 2 groups were comparable for
the duration of appropriate antibiotics, with a median duration of 14 days for both groups (Table 4).
We found a significant difference in the median
number of days between the date of bacteremia and the
exchange or removal of the infected CVC, with the
exchange occurring 1 day later in the exchange group
compared with the removal group (3 days vs 2 days; P ¼
.022) (Table 3). There was no statistically significant difference noted with regard to the rate of bacteremia persistence >72 hours after CVC exchange or removal (5% in
the exchange group vs 4% in the removal group; P > .99)
(Table 4). At 72 hours, the fever resolution rates were similar in both groups (95% in the exchange group vs 86% in
the removal group; P ¼ .21).

Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from late complications are shown between patients in whom the catheter was
exchanged and those in whom the catheter was removed during the 3-month period of follow-up after catheters were
exchanged or removed (P ¼ .03, log-rank test).

No disease recurrences or infection-related deaths
were reported to occur during hospital stays in the
exchange group; however, in the removal control group,
8 patients experienced a recurrence or an infectionrelated death (0% vs 11%; P ¼ .05) (Table 4). In these
patients, the infected catheter was removed after a median of 3 days (range, 0 days-6 days) from the date of
bacteremia.
A log-rank test indicated that patients in whom the
catheter was removed were more likely to develop infection-related complications than those in whom the catheter was exchanged during the 3-month period of followup after catheters were removed or exchanged (P ¼ .03)
(Fig. 1). The overall response rates to antibiotic therapy
were higher in the exchange group (95%) than in the removal group (76%) (P ¼ .011) (Table 4).
All the patients, including those who had an unfavorable outcome (Table 5) (such as persistent of bacteremia, disease recurrence, deep-seated infection, or
infection-related death), received appropriate antibiotic
therapy that was active against the bacteria isolated as
causing the CLABSI.
In the exchange group at the time of last follow-up,
13 patients retained their newly exchanged CVCs, 9
patients had undergone a second exchange that occurred
after a median duration of 34 days (range, 0 days-123

days), and 18 patients had undergone CVC removal after a median duration of 52 days (range, 2 days-179
days). We performed a subset analysis that included only
those patients who retained the exchanged CVCs for 7
days, unless their CVCs had been removed earlier for
persistent bacteremia or disease recurrence. The overall
response rate was significantly higher in the exchange
group than in the control group (94% vs 76%, respectively; P ¼ .025).
In the removal group, among the 66 patients (83%)
who had undergone at least 1 attempt to insert the CVC
at a different site within 3 months after CVC removal, 10
patients (15%) experienced a mechanical failure. However, in the exchange group, only 1 patient (3%) experienced a mechanical failure after an unsuccessful exchange
that necessitated the ultimate removal of the exchanged
CVC (P ¼ .049) (Table 4) (Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study indicate that, in cancer
patients, exchanging infected CVCs in the setting of
CLABSI over a guidewire for MR-coated CVCs is more
effective at reducing the risk of mechanical complications
when compared with CVC removal. Furthermore, antimicrobial MR-coated CVC exchange improves the overall

response to systemic antibiotic treatment and decreases
the risk of infection-related complications.
The results of several studies suggest that CVC
exchange is useful in the treatment of patients with
CLABSIs.14-20 However, most of these studies were open
trials (without comparators such as CVC removal),
included small numbers of CLABSI episodes (mostly
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus CLABSIs), or used loose
definitions of CLABSI. None of these studies used antimicrobial CVCs to replace infected CVCs.14-18 In 2 comparative nonrandomized studies, the CVC was exchanged

2556

only in a subset of patients with mild symptoms who
experienced a response to antimicrobial therapy within 48
hours.19,20 The lack of randomization, uniform entry criteria, and use of antimicrobial CVCs, and the inconsistent
outcome definitions and follow-up procedures have made
it difficult to evaluate the role of CVC exchange, particularly antimicrobial CVCs, in patients with documented
CLABSIs.
In the current study, approximately 62% of the
CLABSIs were caused by non-coagulase–negative Staphylococcus organisms, including gram-positive and gramnegative pathogens. Infected CVCs were exchanged for
MR-coated antimicrobial CVCs at a mean of 3 days after
the initial occurrence of bacteremia. Furthermore,
patients had been followed for 3 months after the
exchange.
Exchanging colonized or infected CVCs over a
guidewire may lead to cross-colonization of the lumen of
newly exchanged, uncoated CVCs, which may perpetuate the CLABSI. Thus, this practice is not advocated in
the setting of CLABSI by the CDC in its guidelines
regarding CLABSI prevention.2 Olson et al demonstrated that uncoated CVCs that were exchanged became
colonized by bacteria within 48 hours.21 Pettigrew et al
demonstrated that organisms can be transferred to the
newly exchanged, uncoated CVC through the
guidewire.3

Cancer

Management of CLABSIs in Cancer Patients/Chaftari et al

Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that
coating the internal and external surfaces of CVCs
with MR prevents the surface adherence of resistant bacteria.22-25 These antimicrobial CVCs are also highly effective at preventing CLABSIs in high-risk patients.7-10
Hence, organisms transferred through the guidewire to
MR-coated CVCs might be inhibited by antimicrobials
and fail to attach to the catheter surface.
In the current study, CVC exchange with MRcoated CVCs led to a higher overall response to systemic
antibiotic therapy as well as a significant decrease in
infection-related complications, although there were
more transplantation patients in the exchange group
compared with the removal group (P ¼ .019) (Table 3).
Furthermore, the exchange group had another risk factor, namely the longer duration between the onset of
bacteremia and intervention (3 days in the exchange
group vs 2 days in the removal group; P ¼ .022) (Table
3). This finding of improved outcome despite the risks
of transplantation and delayed intervention further demonstrates the efficacy and validity of this approach.
Although not statistically significant, more patients in
the removal arm were admitted to the intensive care
unit. This could suggest that the removal group could
have been sicker and thus would have been more likely
to have an unfavorable outcome.
The insertion of a new CVC at a different site is often associated with serious mechanical complications such
as hemopneumothorax.4-6 Exchanging CVCs over a
guidewire decreases the likelihood of mechanical complications in patients with cancer, especially those with
thrombocytopenia and high-risk patients in the intensive
care unit with hypocoagulation conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. In the current study,
more functional CVCs resulted from CVC exchange than
from removal and reinsertion. There was a lower rate of
mechanical failure in the exchange group (3%) compared
with the removal group (15%) (P ¼ .049). Exchanging
the CVC over a guidewire may also result in less discomfort and pain for the patient, thus decreasing symptom
burden and anxiety.
Not only is CVC exchange with MR-coated CVCs
safer and more convenient than the insertion of a new
CVC, it can also result in cost savings. At MDACC,
CVC exchanges are performed by nurses, whereas CVC
insertions at new sites are performed by physicians or
physician extenders. No professional fee is incurred
when a nurse performs an exchange; however, there is an
approximately $1500 fee when a physician or physician

Cancer

June 1, 2011

extender inserts a new CVC. There is also a $750 fee for
the sonography required for CVC insertion; no imaging
is required for a CVC exchange. Thus, the estimated cost
savings at MDACC between exchange and reinsertion
procedures is $2250. The cost of reinserting tunneled
and other surgically implantable CVCs (ports) would
further increase the cost of removal and reinsertion
because of the costs related to the operating room, anesthesia, recovery room, or interventional radiology. The
total cost could also include the treatment of noninfectious mechanical complications such as pneumothorax
and bleeding.
The current study is subject to several limitations.
The first is its observational, retrospective, nonrandomized design, although it was a matched cohort study.
Patients were not on defined prospective clinical protocols, and symptoms and signs were not consistently monitored. Serial blood cultures were not always available
during or after infections, and bacteremia resolution was
not always documented. As a result, we may have underestimated the duration of true bacteremia and the recurrence rate. In addition, a relatively small number of
patients in the current study had undergone CVC
exchange. Another limitation is that we did not standardize the types and durations of antibiotic therapy used or
the timing of CVC exchange or removal from the initial
date of bacteremia (0 days-8 days in the exchange group,
with a median duration of 3 days, and 0 days-12 days in
the removal group, with a median duration of 2 days).
However, the 2 groups received appropriate antibiotic
therapy and were comparable in terms of the duration of
such antibiotic therapy.
In an attempt to salvage the vascular access, this
novel approach of exchanging the catheter over a guidewire with an antimicrobial MR-coated catheter may
change the practice paradigm in the management of
patients with CLABSIs. It may improve patient care and
outcome while decreasing the rate of mechanical complications and may be associated with cost savings. A welldesigned, multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical
trial is needed to validate the results of the current study
and to determine the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the salvage intervention when compared with the
removal of the catheter and insertion of a new CVC at a
different vascular site. Other salvage interventions such as
the use of effective lock therapy in patients with nonexchangeable, surgical tunneled, or implantable catheters
such as ports warrant further investigation through welldesigned prospective, randomized studies.

Conclusions
Exchanging CVCs for MR-coated CVCs in cancer
patients with CLABSIs may be associated with a better
outcome compared with that of CVC removal and reinsertion. It decreases the rate of mechanical complications,
and also may improve the overall response to antibiotic
therapy as well as decrease the risks of late infectionrelated complications. Large, prospective, randomized
clinical trials are needed to validate these findings and to
evaluate the cost savings as well as the improvement in
quality of life associated with the potential decrease in
symptom burden.
