ABSTRACT
Cisplatin is a widely used anticancer drug, while non-targeted delivery, development
of drug resistance, and serious side effects significantly limit its clinical use. In order to
improve the tumor-targeting properties of cisplatin, transferrin (Tf) was employed as a
carrier to transfer cisplatin into cancer cells via transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) mediated
endocytosis. The binding ability of cisplatin and Tf could be improved by pretreating Tf
with 10% ethanol, and the binding number of cisplatin for each Tf molecule could reach
to 40 without structural or functional impairment of Tf. The Tf-cisplatin complex could
be delivered into human ovarian carcinoma cells high efficiently. In tumor-bearing nudemice model, the Tf-cisplatin complex inhibited tumor growth in vivo more effectively
than free cisplatin, with less toxicity in other tissues. Tumor targeting efficiency of the
Tf-cisplatin complex was supported by in vivo and ex vivo imaging and platinum residues
detected in each ex vivo organ. These data suggested that Tf-cisplatin was more effective
and less drug-resistance than cisplatin, with targeting to tumor cells. Therefore, Tfmediated delivery of cisplatin is a potential strategy for targeted delivery into tumor cells.

with different histopathological features and biological
behaviour. Although most ovarian cancer patients present
with advanced-stage disease, response to front-line Ptbased chemotherapy is high, of the order of 75% [3].
Cisplatin is a DNA-damaging anti-tumor agent that
activates nuclear and cytoplasmic signaling pathways involved
in regulation of the cell cycle, damage repair, and programmed
cell death [4]. Cisplatin is also one of the most actively used
drugs for the treatment of ovarian cancer, and the resistance
is easily seen in patients during treatment [5]. Cisplatin is a
neutral Pt (II) complex that enters cells by passive diffusion [6],
so the toxicity is equivalent between cancer cells and normal

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from
gynaecologic cancer, and it is estimated that 22,280 new
diagnoses and 14,240 deaths from this neoplasm will
occur in United States in 2016 [1]. Standard treatment is
platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapy and surgical debulking
of the tumor. There is a high proportion (~ 70%) of
advanced stage cases at diagnosis, and the overall 5-year
survival rate is less than 40% across all stages [2]. Ovarian
cancers overall are comprised of a variety of tumor types

cells. Therefore, the clinical use of cisplatin is limited by its
severe side effects in many systems and organs, including
nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity [7]. Strategies for altering the
entry of cisplatin into cancer cells may be helpful for reducing
side effects and resistance while increasing therapeutic efficacy.
Transferrin (Tf) is the iron transport protein responsible
for delivering iron and a variety of other metals such as
aluminium, Pt, gallium, and indium into cells [8]. The
closed conformation (iron-bound) of Tf is recognized by
the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) found on cytomembrane
[9]. Expression of transferrin receptors on membranes of
various types of cancer cells has been shown to be elevated
2 - 7 times higher than that in normal cells, with an affinity
to Tf that is 10 - 100 times higher compared with that in the
case of normal cells [10, 11]. Therefore, the Tf/TfR1 system
is a viable anti-cancer target for drug delivery [12]. The
feasibilities of using Tf as a tumor-targeted carrier conjugating
with nanomaterials or drugs have been demonstrated in
previous studies. Transferrin-coupling nanoparticles exhibit
certain notable properties, including prolonged circulation
time, low reticuloendothelial system uptake, and in vivo
accumulation and internalization in tumor tissues [13-15].
Some chemical anticarcinogenic drug (triapazamine,
docorubicin, etc) and plant extract medicines (curcumin,
paclitaxel, etc), conjugated directly or via nanoparticles to
transferrin, were designed for tumor-targeting delivery to
increase the efficacy of therapy, meanwhile decreased side
effects [16-19]. Utilization of a targeted delivery strategy
takes advantage of long drug circulation times, increased
cellular uptake, decreased systemic toxicity, and effective
delivery of therapeutic compounds to the disease site [20].
There are many published reports on different molar
ratios of Tf-cisplatin complexes obtained by incubating Tf
and cisplatin. Elliott et al. [21] reported binding of 1 - 2
cisplatin molecules with one Tf molecule. Hoshino et al.
[22] reported cisplatin binding ratios of 3:1, 7:1, and 15:1
after incubating Tf in a water buffer for different times.
Luo et al. [23] reported that Tf had the potential to bind
with 22 cisplatin at different pH.
In current study, we developed an effective cisplatin
delivery system with reduced side effects and better
targeting using the binding of Tf to tumor cells. Our
methods incorporated a pretreatment step using a diluted
organic solvent to relax the structure of Tf, without
functional impairment before incubating with cisplatin.
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were
employed to identify the number of cisplatin molecules
bound to Tf. We expected that cisplatin conjugated
with Tf would enter cells through the Tf-TfR1 pathway
and target tumor cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments
using ovarian cancer cell lines and tumor-bearing mice
demonstrated the efficacy of Tf-cisplatin targeted to tumor
cells. These results may help in development of strategies
for exploiting anticancer drug targeting delivery systems.

Preparation of high purity Tf
Identification and purity of isolated proteins were
determined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Native gradient
PAGE was used to separate proteins. Other weak bands
were visible in the gel as shown in Figure 1A, suggesting
contamination of the analyte. Therefore, proteins were
extracted a second time with native gradient PAGE,
resulting in detection of a single, pure band, which was
removed for preparation of peptide mass fingerprinting.
Spectra from peptide mass fingerprinting were matched to
Tf by a database search.

Improvements in organic solvent-induced
binding
Different organic solvents were used to pretreat Tf
in order to determine the ideal candidate for maximizing
cisplatin binding. After organic solvents pretreatment,
ratio of Tf to cisplatin binding was changed as expected.
As shown in Figure 1B, the gel bands from Tf-cisplatin
pretreated with organic solvents were higher than bands
without pretreatment. In addition, protein molecular
weights were altered, and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA),
formic acid pretreated Tf had the most significant
molecular weight changes. In order to acquire more precise
information about Tf-cisplatin complexes, MALDITOF-MS and ICP-MS were performed to determine
number of cisplatin molecules binding to Tf. Calculation
results were listed in Table 1. Binding numbers tested by
MALDI-TOF-MS and ICP-MS were equivalent. Each
Tf molecule bound 8 molecules of cisplatin naturally
in presence of water. While pretreatment with organic
solvents could increase 2 - 5 folds of the ratio, and 10%
acetone or ethanol pretreatment was the most effective
for increasing cisplatin binding to Tf. Mass spectra of Tf
and Tf pretreated with ethanol were shown in Figure 1C.
The molecular mass of Tf consisted with previous reports.
Molecular mass of Tf-cisplatin obtained by 10% ethanol
pretreatment was as much as 91,992.66, attributable to
approximately 40 cisplatin molecules binding to Tf.
The iron release and circular dichroism (CD)
spectra were used to evaluate the structure and function
of Tf after organic solvents pretreatment. Results of
iron release kinetics were shown in Figure 2A. Initially,
natural release of iron from Tf occurred rapidly, and
stabilized after approximately 16 min. The iron release
rate for whole process was 0.125 Fe3+·Tf-1·min-1, which
was generally in accord with a previous report [24].
When prepared according to the methods described here,
activity of Tf was well maintained. In addition, the iron
release kinetics of Tf pretreated with 10% ethanol before
cisplatin incubation and rotary evaporation were similar to

controls, reaching a balance at 18 min with a rate of 0.111
Fe3+·Tf-1·min-1. After ethanol was removed, Tf recovered
to its active state, which closely resembled controls. The
kinetic results also indicated that cisplatin binding did not
occupy or destroy the iron binding sites.
CD spectroscopy is an optical technique that provides
information about the secondary and tertiary structures of
proteins, including α-helices, inter-chain hydrogen bonded
β-structures and a fully extended parallel or anti-parallel
arrangement of peptide chains. CD spectra of Tf under
different conditions were shown in Figure 2B. The CD
spectrum of native Tf showed a positive peak at 192 nm and
negative peaks at 208 nm and 222 nm [Figure 2B(a)]. The
peaks of Tf pretreated with 10% ethanol were formed at 197
nm (positive) and 206 nm [Figure 2B(b)]. After removal
of ethanol by rotary evaporation, the peaks [Figure 2B(c)]
were almost the same as those of control. The structure
change was reversible. Cisplatin was added to pretreated
Tf for combination before ethanol removal, and the CD
spectrum [Figure 2B(d)] was much different from Figure
2B(a) or (b), but removing ethanol from mixture made the
differences between complete recovery. Owing to temporary
structural changes in Tf with ethanol pretreatment, a number
of cisplatin binding sites exposed, enabling the Tf to carry
more cisplatin, and after ethanol removal, Tf in Tf-cisplatin
was still to maintain its overall structure.
The stability of Tf-cisplatin was shown in Table 2.
When maintained in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer
at room temperature, the number of bound cisplatin

molecules was 54.85 and 44.35 during the first two days
respectively. And between the third and seventh day,
number of cisplatin molecules bound per Tf molecule was
maintained at 41, suggesting that Tf-cisplatin remains stable
in PBS buffer at room temperature for at least one week.

Intracellular uptake and distribution of Tfcisplatin
The distribution of cisplatin inside or outside the
cells after cisplatin or Tf-cisplatin treatment was shown in
Table 3. The average content of cisplatin inside the cells
in cisplatin group was significantly lower than that of Tfcisplatin group, no matter after 5 min or 3 h treatment. A
sharp decline of cisplatin content inside the cells (from
1.84 to 0.42 μg) was detected in Tf-pretreated Tf-cisplatin
group at 5 min, but no significant content difference was
detected between without and with pretreatment after 3 h
incubation. Moreover, as we expected, the pretreatment
had no influence on cisplatin group.
The recognition and binding abilities of Tf-cisplatin
with TfR on cells were estimated using laser-scanning
confocal microscopy (LSCM). As shown in Figure 2C,
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled Tf-cisplatin
bound to the cell membrane in A2780CP70 cells, with a
portion being transported into the cells, and the uptake was
continuous increase as time. With 200 μg/mL of Tf for 1 h
pretreatment, the fluorescence signal of FTIC labeled Tfcisplatin was significantly decreased at 5 min, but with

no differences at 3 h. The fluorescence signal changes
of FTIC labeled Tf-cisplatin were consistent with that of
FITC labeled Tf in cells.
The two results (ICP-MS and LSCM analysis)
complemented each other for a better understanding of Tfcisplatin binding and entering into cells. Tf pretreatment
declined the combination of Tf-cisplatin to TfR, and
reduced its transport into cells in the first period. The
influence was disappeared as time, that might because the
surface-bound, intracellular, and recycled characteristics
of TfR mediated endocytosis.

for A2780CP70 cells, which was significantly lower than
that of free cisplatin. These data suggested that inhibition
of cell growth attributable to Tf-cisplatin was better than
free cisplatin for both A2780S and A2780CP70 cell lines.
IC50 of HK-2 cells was 2.5 μg/mL for free cisplatin and
4.61 μg/mL (cisplatin) for Tf-cisplatin. Tf-cisplatin was
efficacious for inducing cytotoxicity at a relatively lower
concentration compared to free cisplatin in cancer cells
and a higher concentration in non-cancer cells.
Three cell lines were employed in this study and
bivariate Annexin V-FITC/PI maps and data of cells after
treatment with various levels of cisplatin or Tf-cisplatin
were shown in Figures 3B&3C, Supplementary Figure
1 and Supplementary Table 1. Percentage of apoptotic
cells in Tf-cisplatin group, whether early (Q3) or late
apoptosis (Q2), were higher than that in cisplatin group,
meanwhile, the percentage of viable cells (Q4) was lower
in A2780CP70 cells at concentrations of 2.5, 5 or 10 μg/
mL after 48 h incubation. Similar results were observed in
A2780S cells at concentration of 0.625, 1.25, or 2.5 μg/
mL. In contrast, in non-cancer HK-2 cells, significantly
lower early apoptosis (Q3) and higher viability (Q4) was
detected in Tf-cisplatin group in comparison with cisplatin
group.

Increased cytotoxicity of Tf-cisplatin in cancer
cells
Differences in cytotoxicity between free cisplatin
and Tf-cisplatin were determined using MTT assay and
flow cytometry in vitro. IC50 values and the dose-response
curves were shown in Table 4 and Figure 3A, which were
calculated using probit method. The IC50 of free cisplatin
was 1.53 μg/mL for A2780S cells and 10.39 μg/mL for
A2780CP70 cells. The resistance factor of A2780CP70/
A2780S was 6.8. IC50 of Tf-cisplatin was 0.78 μg/mL
(cisplatin) for A2780S cells and 4.23 μg/mL (cisplatin)

and paclitaxel in vitro [35]. Expression of MDR1 was
higher in A2780CP70 cells than that in A2780S cells.
Cisplatin treatment increased MDR1 mRNA expression,
whereas Tf-cisplatin treatment did not change MDR1
mRNA levels compared to controls in both A2780S
and A2780CP70 cells (Figure 4D). ERCC1 and LRP
expression levels in A2780CP70 were in accord with
MDR1. In A2780S cells, there were no obvious changes
of ERCC1 expression between cisplatin, Tf-cisplatin
and controls; however, LRP expression after cisplatin
treatment was significantly down-regulated with no
obvious changes between Tf-cisplatin treated cells and
controls (Figures 4E & 4F). The lack of obvious changes
in expression of MDR1, ERCC1 and LRP after treatment
with Tf-cisplatin might be explained by reduced resistance
to cisplatin in A2780S and A2780CP70 cells.

To explore the mechanisms leading to altered
intracellular Pt concentrations, we measured the
expression levels of three genes encoding copper transport
proteins, including human copper transporter 1 (hCTR1),
ATPase, copper transporting, alpha polypeptide (ATP7A),
and ATPase, copper transporting, beta polypeptide
(ATP7B). These genes have recently been shown to
take part in uptake and efflux of Pt drugs (e.g., cisplatin,
carboplatin, oxaliplatin) [25-27]. In addition, we analyzed
the expression levels of three genes associated with
drug resistance, including multiple drug resistance 1
(MDR1), excision repair cross-complementation group 1
(ERCC1) and lung resistance protein (LRP) in A2780S and
A2780CP70 cells, and the results were shown in Figure 4.
The cisplatin-sensitive cell line, A2780S, expressed
a significantly higher level of hCTR1 than cisplatinresistant cell line, A2780CP70, regardless of treatment.
These data suggest that A2780S cells have an increased
capacity for transporting cisplatin via copper transporting
channels. After cisplatin treatment for 48 h, mRNA
expression of hCTR1 was up-regulated in A2780S and
significantly down-regulated in A2780CP70 cells (Figure
4A). These results were consistent with reports that
A2780CP70 cells reduce cisplatin uptake by decreasing
hCTR1 expression [28, 29]. Tf-cisplatin treatment did not
significantly change hCTR1 expression in both cell line
compared to controls, suggesting Tf-cisplatin uptake was
not through hCTR1.
In A2780CP70 cells, both treatments did not
induce significant changes in ATP7A gene expression.
But ATP7A was significantly upregulated after both
treatments compared to controls in A2780S cells (Figure
4B). The expression of ATP7B was significantly downregulated by cisplatin and up-regulated by Tf-cisplatin
treatment compared to controls in A2780CP70 cells.
Furthermore, cisplatin treatment resulted in a dramatic
up-regulation of ATP7B in A2780S cells (Figure 4C).
The ATP7A transporter sequesters Pt drugs in secretory
vesicles, and over-expression of the ATP7A transporter
results in increased accumulation of Pt drugs in ovarian
carcinoma cells [30, 31]. Similarly, the ATP7B transporter
increased cisplatin resistance by transporting Pt out of
oral squamous cell carcinoma cells [32]. Tf-cisplatin
treatment could made more cisplatin into both A2780S
and A2780CP70 cells (Table 3), but ATP7A and ATP7B
expression results suggested that Tf-cisplatin treatment
could decrease cisplatin excretion via ATP7A and ATP7B.
MDR1 plays an important role in the development
of drug resistance in cells, according to actively effluxes
a wide array of anticancer drugs, including cisplatin and
paclitaxel [33]. ERCC1 expression levels determined the
sensitivity of cells to Pt in part [34], and LRP expression
was associated with resistance to anti-cancer drugs
including cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide

Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging
To further verify the active tumor targeting and in
vivo real-time distribution of Tf-cisplatin, a whole animal
NIRF imaging approach was carried out in A2780CP70
tumor xenograft nude mice. The near-infrared dye Cy7.5
was conjugated to Tf (Tf-cisplatin) and then injected into
mice, resulting in the observance of fluorescent signals
as shown in Figure 5A. In mice injected with free Cy7.5,
the strongest fluorescent signal was observed in liver,
and whole body fluorescence faded over time and nearly
disappeared by 24 h. In mice injected with Cy7.5-labeled
Tf-cisplatin, the fluorescent signals gradually shifted to
liver and tumor tissues within 24 h after injection. After
48 h, fluorescent signals had shifted to tumor tissue and
then kidney at 72 h post-injection. The distribution of
Tf-cisplatin in different tissues was also demonstrated by
NIRF imaging in excised organs (Figure 5B). A strong
fluorescent signal was only detected in liver and tumor
tissue, and a weak signal was observed in kidney of mice
injected with Cy7.5-labeled Tf-cisplatin which were
consistent with the in vivo NIRF imaging. As a main
metabolism organ, Tf-cisplatin, cisplatin, Tf and dye were
cleared out of the mouse body via liver related metabolic
pathway. In Cy7.5 group, fluorescent signal in liver was
lasting for about 24 h, and Tf conjugation prolonged the
circulation time. As time pass by, the fluorescent signal
accumulated in tumor tissue, which was stronger than that
in liver at 48 h in Tf-cisplatin treatment.

In vivo therapy of Tf-cisplatin in mice
PBS, free cisplatin, and Tf-cisplatin (equivalent to
10 mg/kg of free cisplatin) was injected into tumor-bearing
mice (10 days after subcutaneous implant of A2780CP70
cells) via the tail vein twice a week for 1 month to
evaluate therapeutic potential. Body weight changes in
all mice were recorded and are shown in Figure 6A. Four
weeks after initiating treatment, reduced body weights

in Tf-cisplatin and cisplatin treated mice were observed,
and effect was less dramatic in Tf-cisplatin treated mice
compared to free cisplatin treated mice.
Residual Pt in each tissue was detected using
ICP-MS (Figure 6B), which could indicate whole-body
distribution of cisplatin in drug-treated groups. The
residual Pt detected in various tissues of PBS treatment
mice was used for establishing baseline values. In all
non-tumor tissues, residual Pt (μg/g dried tissues) was
lower in Tf-cisplatin treatment group compared to free
cisplatin group, especially in liver and spleen where the
difference had reached highly significant levels (P < 0.01).
In subcutaneous tumor tissues, cisplatin accumulation in
Tf-cisplatin treatment group was approximately 5 times
of free cisplatin treatment group. These data suggested
that Tf-cisplatin treatment increased the distribution of
cisplatin to tumor tissues. Extended Tf-cisplatin treatment
(twice a week for one month) resulted in remarkable
less accumulation of cisplatin in liver compared to free
cisplatin treatment group, and increased distribution of
cisplatin in tumor tissues, which suggested a good curative
effect with fewer side effects.
Morphological changes in tumor tissues from
different treatment groups were observed using histology
(Figure 6C). Cells in tumor tissues of control (PBS) group

presented distinctive boundary, regular arrangement,
even distribution, clear nuclei and cytoplasm [Figures
6C (A1 & A2)]. In treatment (cisplatin and Tf-cisplatin)
groups, tumor tissues showed loose arrangement,
cytoplasmic overflow, and cell death [Figures 6C (B1,
B2, C1, C2)]. There was more extensive cell death and
much looser tissue structure was observed in tumor tissue
of tumor-bearing mice with Tf-cisplatin treatment. Thirty
days after initiating treatment, the tumor volumes in
mice of Tf-cisplatin and cisplatin groups were partially
controlled (Figure 6D). Tumor volume of three treatment
groups had a slow growth rate for the first two weeks.
Two weeks after initiating treatment, tumor volume of
PBS group rapidly increased until the end of the study.
In contrast, tumor growth rates of cisplatin and Tfcisplatin treatment groups were significantly reduced, and
side effects observed in Tf-cisplatin group were fewer
compared to free cisplatin group. At the end of treatment
period, tumor volume of PBS group had reached 418
mm3, whereas tumor volumes of cisplatin and Tf-cisplatin
treatment groups were 178 mm3 and 93 mm3 respectively.
Differences between treatment groups were highly
significant. RTV and relative tumor proliferation rate (%)
after 30 days of treatment are shown in Table 5. At the
end of treatment period, RTVs of cisplatin and Tf-cisplatin

groups were lower than control (PBS) group. And RTV of
Tf-cisplatin group was significantly lower than cisplatin
group. Relative tumor proliferation rate (%) in cisplatin
and Tf-cisplatin treatment groups were 43.09 and 23.53,
respectively. A relative tumor proliferation rate (%) less
than 60% was suggestive of a positive treatment outcome.
Treatment with both cisplatin and Tf-cisplatin resulted in a
relative tumor proliferation rate (%) under 60. These data
suggested that cisplatin and Tf-cisplatin treatment could
effectively inhibit the growth of subcutaneous tumor
tissue in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, Tf-cisplatin
was more effective for inhibiting tumor growth than free
cisplatin.

First, our study for the first time reports the benefits
of organic solvents pretreatment, which significantly
increases the binding ability and minimally affects
the functions of Tf after evaporation. Second, by the
pretreatment, the cisplatin binding number is up to 41 per
Tf, which is far more than 15 - 22 molecules as previous
reports [29, 30, 36, 37]. Third, the native gradient PAGE
method for extraction of Tf from human serum, instead
of existing methods (mainly by salt precipitation, SDSPAGE and chromatography) was established by our
group, which was relatively close to the physiological
state of the protein. Finally, the whole preparation process
of Tf-cisplatin is convenient to operate. By pretreated
with 10% ethanol, iron release and CD spectra (Figures
2A & 2B) indicated pretreatment with 10% ethanol did
not significantly influence structure and function of Tf.
These results were likely explained by temporary changes
to the Tf microenvironment, attributable to treatment with

organic solvents. Specifically, structurally integrity of Tf
was relaxed after treatment with 10% ethanol, exposing
additional cisplatin binding sites and increasing the
combination ratio of cisplatin and Tf. Once ethanol was
volatilized, the structural integrity of Tf molecule was
restored, resulting in a stable Tf-cisplatin (Table 2). These
results had significant implications for treatment of cancer
both in vitro and in vivo.
As increased cisplatin/TF ratio, delivery of Tfcisplatin to cancer cells was more efficient, and Tf-cisplatin
had better inhibition effect for cancer cells than free
cisplatin under the same cisplatin concentration in general
(Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary
Table 1). Treatment of cells with Tf-cisplatin induced
similar apoptosis at a lower concentration than free
cisplatin. The effect remained consistent in cisplatinresistant cell line, A2780CP70, and was reflected in the
expression changes of related genes and proteins. There
was reported that Tf-cisplatin treatment could increase
expression of 23 proteins related to chemotherapeutic
cytotoxicity and resistance in HepG2 cells [23]. Cisplatin

resistance could be accompanied by changes of copper
metabolism. In this work, we measured expression levels
of copper transporting and drug-resistance related genes
(Figure 4). Cisplatin treatment induced obvious changes
in expression of drug-resistance related genes, while there
were no significant changes after Tf-cisplatin treatment.
These data suggested that Tf-cisplatin might attenuate the
incidence of cisplatin resistance. Furthermore, uptake of
Tf-cisplatin in cancer cells was not mediated by copper
(cisplatin) transporting proteins, which may explain the
lack of changes in expression levels of MDR1, ERCC1
and LRP in Tf-cisplatin treated cells compared to controls.
Cy7.5-labeling of Tf-cisplatin enabled real-time biophotonic imaging of Tf-cisplatin transport. Fluorescent
intensity in mice injected with Cy7.5-labeled Tf-cisplatin
was greater and more prolonged than free Cy7.5 (Figure
5). This elevated fluorescent signal of Cy7.5-labeled Tfcisplatin in tumors was likely attributable to an extended
residence time in tumor. Tf-cisplatin treatment resulted
in reductions in subcutaneous tumors tissue from tumorbearing nude mice compared to free cisplatin treatment

using an equivalent cisplatin dosage. This was determined
by reduction in tumor volume, increased cell death and
structural disorganization within tumor tissue (Figures
6C&6D). Results of NIFR imaging suggested that Tfcisplatin targets delivery of cisplatin to tumor tissue,
thereby reducing residual accumulation of Pt in normal
tissues. This likely explains the fewer side effects
observed with Tf-cisplatin compared to free cisplatin.
Taken together, these results suggested that Tf-cisplatin
effectively targets cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, with
improved therapeutic effects and fewer side effects.

by electron transfer for 1 h. Ultrafiltration with a 30 kDa
cutoff was used to concentrate the extract, and process
was duplicated for further separation and purification.
Finally, nacarat protein extract was collected and stored
at - 20°C until further use. The purity of Tf was confirmed
using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (nativePAGE, T = 8%) and MALDI-TOF (Bruker ultrafleXtreme,
Germany) analysis. The in-gel digestion and peptide
mass fingerprinting were performed according to a
previous report [23]. Observed peptide mass fingerprints
were sent to NCBI’s database at MASCOT (http:www.
matrixscience.com), with mass accuracies within 0.3
Daltons; both hydroxymethylation and oxidation were
considered.

CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, we increased Tf binding
with cisplatin without structural or functional damage
by pretreating Tf molecule with 10% ethanol. We
demonstrated efficacy of Tf-targeted delivery of cisplatin
to tumor cells and tissues using ovarian cancer cell lines
and in vivo tumor mouse model. Data demonstrated that Tf
could be an effective carrier for transporting cisplatin into
cells via Tf-TfR1 pathway. This delivery method increased
cellular uptake of cisplatin, avoided drug resistance and
targeted delivery of drug in tumor-bearing mouse model.

Binding ability of Tf with cisplatin
Tf was diluted to 40 μg/μL with PBS. The Tf
solution (1 μL) was pretreated with 20 μL of different
organic solvents as follows: 1) double distilled water
(ddw) as control, 2) 1% TFA, 3) 10% acetone, 4) 10%
ethanol, 5) 1% formic acid, 6) 10% acetonitrile, 7) 10%
methanol. Then, samples were incubated at 37°C for 30
min, and 30 μL of cisplatin (1 μg/μL, Qilu Pharmaceutical
Co., LTD) was added to each sample and incubated for an
additional 2 h. Organic solvents were slowly evaporated
from the mixture using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator
(Eppendorf, concentrator plus, Germany) for 30 min. The
residual cisplatin was eliminated by ultrafiltration with a
30 kDa cut-off. MALDI-TOF-MS and ICP-MS (Agilent
7700, USA) analyses were employed to determine the Tfcisplatin binding rate.
For MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, 1 μL mixture of
2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and analyte solution (10
mg/mL of Tf) of equal volume were loaded onto stainless
steel plate wells with natural air-drying. MALDI-TOF-MS
instrumental conditions included a positive linear mode, a
40 μs delayed extraction of ions, and 2-ns pulse width laser
beam. For ICP-MS analysis, a Tf (50 μL) or Tf-cisplatin
(40 μg/mL of Tf) solution was digested with 250 μL
ultrapure HNO3 for 60 min at 60°C. The digested solution
was then diluted to 5.0 mL by deionised water. Standard Pt
solutions, prepared together with test samples, were used to

MATERIALS AND METHODS

These studies were conducted according to the
principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and
were approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen, China. Human serum was
supplied by Zhongshan Hospital (Xiamen, China) and
informed consent was obtained from the donors, and the
date were analyzed anonymously. 8 mL serum was diluted
with 2 mL sample buffer (× 5,600 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl pH
6.8, 5 mL of glycerol, 1.0 mL of 1% bromophenol blue,
3.4 mL of distilled water) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g
for 10 min. Then, supernatant fractions were collected and
separated by 4 - 10% native gradient polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. After 18 h, a visible nacarat protein band

generate calibration curves, and 5% (v/v) ultrapure HNO3
was used as blank control. All of solutions were analysed
using external calibration curve; background values were
subtracted. The operation and calibration of instrument
were carried out according to specifications. Parameters
were set as follows: plasma power output: 1,300 W, RF
generator frequency: 40 MHz, analog stage voltage: 1,850
V, pulse stage voltage: 800 V, number of data acquisition
replicates: 5, external flow: 13 L/min, carrier gas flow: 0.85
L/min, isotope monitored: 195 Pt, collision/reaction gas: H2
with flow of 2.5 mL/min, QP bias: 11 V, octapole bias: 13
V, and extraction: - 3.5 V. Three independent replicates of
each sample were analysed.

A2780CP70 cell line was treated with approximately 2
μM cisplatin every 3 - 5 passages to maintain cisplatin
resistance. Cisplatin contents outside and inside the
cells under treatment of free cisplatin and Tf-cisplatin
were detected using ICP-MS. A2780CP70 cells (2 × 106
cells per well) were cultured in 6-well, and divided into
cisplatin and Tf-cisplatin treatment group, then each group
was divided into two sub-groups, namely with or without
200 μg/mL of Tf pretreatment for 1 h before cisplatin or
Tf-cisplatin treatment (with 5 μg/mL of cisplatin). After
5 min or 3 h treatment, cells and medium were collected
to test cisplatin distribution using ICP-MS, respectively.
Every treatment has triple samples.
Uptake of FITC-labeled Tf and Tf-cisplatin was
determined in A2780CP70 cells by confocal microscopy.
Cells were cultured in Millicell EZ-SLIDE 8-well plates
(Millipore) and divided into four treatment groups: 1)
FITC-labeled Tf, 2) FITC-labeled Tf with 200 μg/mL of Tf
pretreatment for 1 h, 3) FITC labeled Tf-cisplatin, 4) FITC
labeled Tf-cisplatin with 200 μg/mL of Tf pretreatment
for 1 h. After 5 min or 3 h incubation, cells were fixed at
4% formaldehyde for 15 min, washed 3 times with PBS,
counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Invitrogen). Cells were imaged using a laser scanning
confocal microscope (CarlZeiss LSM780, Germany). Ten
visual fields of each slice were quickly scanned for 400
points along the X and Y axes with an intensity of 40 60% and laser intensity of 300 mW.

Release of iron
Iron release kinetics of purified Tf were determined
using 10% Na2S2O4 and 1% α,α’-bipyridine solvents as
electronating agent and chelating agent. Tf (1 μL of a
40 μg/mL solution), 10% Na2S2O4 (100 μL) and 1%
α,α’-bipyridine (100 μL) were mixed in 96-well plates
before analysis. OD520nm values were determined using a
microplate system (Spectra Max M2, USA) every 10 s for
30 min.

CD spectra
The protein samples used for CD spectrum
measurements (Jasco 810, Japan) were diluted to a
concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Samples were divided into
five groups: a) control Tf, b) Tf pretreated with 10%
ethanol at 37°C for 30 min, without rotary evaporation,
c) sample from b rotary evaporated for 30 min to remove
ethanol, d) Tf pretreated with 10% ethanol at 37°C for
30 min and incubated with cisplatin for 2 h, without
rotary evaporation, e) sample from d rotary evaporated
for 30 min to remove ethanol. Instrument parameters
were set as follows: scanning wavelength: 180 - 250 nm,
bandwidth: 2 nm, sensitivity: standard, response time: 2 s,
scanning speed: 500 nm/min, optical path: 1 mm at room
temperature. Each sample was tested in triplicate.

MTT assay
Preliminary cytotoxicity of cisplatin and Tf-cisplatin
was estimated using MTT assay. Cells (3 × 103) were
plated onto 96-well culture plates using 100 μL fresh
culture medium and then incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Cells were allowed to adhere overnight prior to exposure
to different concentrations (Figure 3A) of cisplatin or Tfcisplatin for 48 h. Then, the medium was replaced by MTT
solution at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. After a 2
h incubation, MTT solution was carefully replaced with
0.1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Solubilisation of
the formazan crystals was enhanced by agitation of the
plate for 15 min before the optical density was measured
at 570 nm, and use to calculate inhibition rate. SPSS 19.0
and Probit regression (logit model) method were used to
calculate the IC50 of cisplatin and Tf-cisplatin for cells.

Stability of Tf-cisplatin
Tf-cisplatin was prepared using the method
described above in PBS buffer at room temperature. Tf (40
μg) and cisplatin (16 μg) were used to initiate the reaction.
The residual cisplatin was eliminated by ultrafiltration
with a 30 kDa cut-off by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for
10 min. The retention solution was collected to check Pt
content using ICP-MS and to calculate the number of
cisplatin bound to Tf per reaction.

Cellular apoptosis
Cells were cultured in 12-well cell culture plates using
3 × 105 cells per well. Then cisplatin or Tf-cisplatin was
added in doses from 0 - 10 μg/mL. After 48 h incubation,
cells were harvested and stained with AnnexinV-FITC and
propidium iodide (PI) in accordance with the instructions
of a cellular apoptosis detection kit (Nanjing KeyGEN
Biotech. Co. Ltd). Apoptosis was determined by flow
cytometry (Beckman, Gallios, USA). Flow rate and cell

concentration of samples were adjusted to keep acquisition
lower than 500 cells/s. At least 104 cells were acquired for
analysis. Data were collected and further analysed using
FlowJo 7.0 (Emerald Biotech Co., Ltd. FlowJo China).

Tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into
three groups (n = 4 per group) and intravenously treated
with PBS, cisplatin (10 mg/kg), or Tf-cisplatin (equivalent
to 10 mg/kg cisplatin). Mice in each group were treated
twice a week for one month and monitored daily for
survival. Before every treatment, mouse weights were
taken and tumor size was measured using Vernier calipers
(volume = length × width2 × л/6) [38]. Relative tumor
volume (RTV) and tumor proliferation rate (%) were
calculated according to the following equations:
RTV = Vt/V0
where V0 is the tumor volume at the begin of
treatment and Vt is the tumor volume at t day after
treatment, and
relative tumor proliferation rate (%) = (TRTV/CRTV)
× 100
where TRTV is tumor volume of drug-treatment group
(free cisplatin treatment group and Tf-cisplatin treatment
group) and CRTV is tumor volume of control group (PBS
group).
At the end of the treatment period, mice were
sacrificed and heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain
tumor tissues were excised immediately. Half of the organ
volumes were flash fixed in Bouin’s Fluid for hematoxylin
and eosin staining (HE stain). The remaining organ halves
were dried for the detection of Pt.

Gene expression
Approximately 106 cells (A2780CP70 or A2780S)
were plated in 6-well plates and incubated with 2 mL
medium at 37°C and 5% CO2 overnight. The following
day, medium was replaced with fresh medium (control) or
medium containing cisplatin or Tf-cisplatin (concentration
of cisplatin was 1.5 μg/mL for A2780S and 10.0 μg/mL
for A2780CP70) and then incubated for an additional
48 h. Cells were harvested for total RNA extraction
using TRIzol. cDNA was obtained using the Takara
PrimeScriptTM RT-PCR Kit. Real time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) was performed according to the manual
of SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM II (Perfect Real Time)
Kit. Genes involved in the uptake and efflux of Pt that
are associated with Pt-drug resistance were tested using
quantitative RT-PCR. Housekeeping genes (β-actin and
GAPDH) were used as internal controls. Primers used in
this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

In vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging
Male athymic BALB/c (Balb/C-nu) mice, 4 - 6
weeks of age and weighing 18 - 20 g were purchased from
the Model Animal Research Center of Xiamen University
and housed under laminar flow and sterile conditions.
Animal handling was performed in accordance with the
guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of
Xiamen University. In order to develop subcutaneous
tumor-bearing mouse models, A2780CP70 cells were
harvested and resuspended in PBS. The BALB/c mice
were then subcutaneously injected with 0.2 mL of a cell
suspension containing 5 × 106 A2780CP70 cells in the
upper right flank. Tumor growth was monitored daily until
the tumor volumes were approximately 30 - 50 mm3.
Cy7.5 NHS ester (Lumiprobe Corporation, USA) was
chosen as the in vivo imaging dye and used in accordance
with manufacturer’s instructions. The number of required
Cy7.5 conjugated to each Tf was determined to be not less
than 8. When mouse tumors reached volumes up to 50 mm3,
the mice were randomly divided into three groups (n = 4 per
group) and injected with either 0.2 mL of PBS, free Cy7.5
(0.05 mg/kg) or Cy7.5-labeled Tf-cisplatin (1 mg/mL Tf,
0.01 – 0.1 mg/kg Cy7.5) via tail vein. Images were taken
using an IVIS® Lumina II in vivo imaging system (Caliper
LifeScience, USA) at 3 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post injection
with wavelengths of 745 nm excitation and 810 - 875 nm
emissions. After in vivo imaging, the mice were sacrificed
by cervical dislocation. Tissue from organs, including the
heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain, and tumor tissue
were excised and imaged using the IVIS® Lumina II in vivo
imaging system as described above.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Determination of residual Pt in each tissue
The excised tissues were dried in an 80°C oven and
then ground into powder for ICP-MS analysis. The powder
(0.02 g) was digested with 1 mL HNO3 for 12 h in a 60°C
water bath. The concentration of HNO3 in the mixture was
diluted to 2% before ICP-MS analysis. The operation and
instrument calibrations were the same as described above.

Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as means ± SD of triplicate
experiments. Significant differences among groups were
determined using a one-way ANOVA followed by the LSD
post-hoc test. Probabilities of p< 0.05were considered to
be statistically significant.
