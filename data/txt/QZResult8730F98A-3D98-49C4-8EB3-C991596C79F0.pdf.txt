BACKGROUND. Excision repair cross-complementation Group 1 (ERCC1) overexpression is associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients
with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A preliminary study also suggested that
ERCC1 expression is associated with radioresistance in lung cancer cells. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the clinical implications of ERCC1 expression in
stage IIIA N2-positive NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based neoadjuvant
concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery.

METHODS. Sixty-eight patients with mediastinoscopy-proven N2-positive NSCLC
were enrolled between August 1997 and September 2003. ERCC1 expression was
assessed by immunohistochemistry from pretreatment mediastinoscopic biopsy
specimens.

RESULTS. ERCC1 expression was positive in 31 of 68 specimens (46%). Among 14
patients who obtained pathologic complete response, 6 were positive for ERCC1
expression and 8 were negative (P 5 .818). On univariate analysis, with median
follow-up of 61.8 months (range, 34.3-108.8 months), progression-free survival
was 15.9 months for ERCC1-positive and 29.5 months for ERCC1-negative
patients (P 5 .062), and there was a statistically significant difference in overall
survival between ERCC1-negative tumors and ERCC1-positive tumors (89.2 vs
26.0 months, P 5 .014). On multivariate analysis, ERCC1 negativity (P 5 .041) and
achieving mediastinal nodal clearance (downstage to pathological N0 or N1) after
neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery (P 5 .005) were significant independent
prognostic factors for the prolongation of survival.

CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that N2-positive NSCLC patients with
ERCC1 negative tumors show a survival benefit from neoadjuvant CCRT with a
platinum-containing regimen. Cancer 2008;113:1379–86.  2008 American

onsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the commonest cause of
cancer deaths worldwide.1 Although surgical resection plays a
major role in curative treatments, less than 20% of NSCLC patients
present with operable stage disease. In locally advanced stage IIIA
disease (pT1-3N2M0), the 5-year cumulative survival rate after
resection is 23%.2 Recent data show that survival with locally
advanced NSCLC can be improved by the addition of chemotherapy
to radiotherapy and/or surgery.3-5 The cytotoxic effects of platinumbased anticancer drugs are attributed to the formation of bulky

platinum-DNA adducts and interstrand cross-links.
The nucleotide excision repair pathway has a central
role in DNA repair and is associated with resistance
to platinum-based chemotherapy.6-9 Excision repair
cross-complementation Group 1 (ERCC1) plays a key
role in nucleotide excision repair and removes platinum-induced DNA adducts.10-12 Several clinical studies have shown that ERCC1 expression is associated
with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and
poor prognoses in several tumors, including
NSCLC.13-17 A preliminary study also suggested that
ERCC1 expression is associated with radioresistance
in lung cancer cells.18 This study was conducted to
evaluate the association between ERCC1 expression
and clinical benefits such as pathologic complete
responses, mediastinal lymph node clearance, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)
in stage IIIA N2-positive NSCLC patients treated with
platinum-based neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment
Eighty-three patients with mediastinoscopic biopsyproven N2-positive NSCLC were treated with CCRT
followed by surgery between August 1997 and December 2003. All specimens were collected by mediastinoscopic lymph node biopsy before any therapy.
Sixty-eight tissue samples from the 83 patients were
adequate for ERCC1 expression analysis. All the
patients had histologically or cytologically confirmed
NSCLC and mediastinoscopic biopsy-proven stage
IIIA, N2 disease. Their Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status was 0 to 1. Patients
selected for the study had adequate bone marrow,
liver, and renal functions. None of them had undergone any previous oncological treatment.
Neoadjuvant CCRT included chemotherapy and
concurrent thoracic radiotherapy. The chemotherapy
regimens consisted of weekly paclitaxel (50 mg/m2
per week intravenously [iv]) or docetaxel (20 mg/m2
per week iv) plus cisplatin (25 mg/m2 per week iv) or
carboplatin (AUC 1.5/week iv) for 5 weeks (from
March 2001 to September 2003) and cisplatin (60-100
mg/m2 iv, Day 1) plus oral etoposide (50 mg/m2 per
os, Day 1-14) every 4 weeks (from September 1997 to
March 2001). The radiation dose was 45 grays (Gy)
over 5 weeks (1.8 Gy/fraction per day, 5 fractions/
week) using 10-MV x-rays. Surgical resection was
planned at around 4 weeks after the completion of
neoadjuvant CCRT (Fig. 1). Postoperative radiation
therapy (18 Gy in 10 fractions) was administered in
the event of persistent histologically positive N2

lymph nodes, positive multi-N1 lymph nodes, or a
positive resection margin at the time of surgery.

Assessments
The pretreatment evaluation included the patient’s
history, physical examination, performance status,
chest x-ray, complete blood count, blood chemistry,
computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest,
whole-body bone scan, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
Surgical staging was performed by 1 of 2 experienced
thoracic surgeons (Y.M.S. and J.K., 19 and 14 years of
experience, respectively). During mediastinoscopy,
the surgeons routinely examined the American Thoracic Society (ATS) lymph node map areas of 2R, 4R,
2L, 4L, and 7; during thoracotomy, they dissected all
visible and palpable lymph nodes accessible in the
mediastinum according to our routine surgical protocol. All encountered lymph nodes were removed
from 10R, 9, 8, 7, 4R, 3, and 2R ATS lymph node map
areas in tumors of the right lung and from areas 10L,
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4L of the left lung. When necessary,
especially when imaging results suggested possible
nodal metastasis in nodal stations other than routine
lymph node dissection, Group 1 (highest mediastinal) or 2L (tumors located in the left lung) nodes
were also evaluated during mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy. Surgeons labeled dissected lymph nodes
by numbering the nodes according to the lymph
node map definition for lung cancer staging proposed by Mountain and Dresler.19 Subsequently, a
pathologist assessed nodes numbered in surgical
fields and recorded the presence or absence of tumor
in these nodes. The pathologist also described tumors
(ie, histopathologic types, surrounding organ involvement, necrosis, fibrosis, tumor volume, and distance
from resection margin). Restaging procedures with

ERCC1 as a Prognostic Marker in NSCLC/Hwang et al

complete clinical, radiological evaluations including
CT scan of the chest were performed after CCRT;
clinical responses to CCRT were assessed according
to the World Health Organization criteria. Pathological responses (complete pathologic response, mediastinal lymph node clearance) were evaluated after
surgery and the completion of CCRT. Complete pathologic response was defined as 95% necrosis and fibrosis, and mediastinal lymph node clearance as
down-staged to pN0-1 after CCRT.20 Patients who
underwent surgery were evaluated by chest CT every
3 months for 2 years after surgery, and then every 6
months thereafter. Approval was obtained from the
institutional review boards, according to legal
requirements.

Immunohistochemistry for ERCC1 Expression
Mediastinoscopic biopsy specimens before any therapy were analyzed for ERCC1 expression. Formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were sectioned
to 4 lm thickness. The tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and then rehydrated in serially graded
alcohol. ERCC1 antigen retrieval consisted of heating
in 10 mM citrate buffer at pH 6.0 with microwaves (15
minutes, 700 W), and cooling to room temperature
for 20 minutes. After washing in Tris-buffered saline
(TBS), the slides were preincubated in 5% normal
blocking solution (goat serum) for 10 minutes to
reduce nonspecific binding. The slides were incubated overnight at room temperature with mouse
monoclonal anti-ERCC1 (8F1; Neomarkers, Fremont,
Calif) at a 1:200 dilution in a humidified chamber.
The primary antibody was observed with an avidinbiotin complex (ABC) system (Dako, Carpinteria,
Calif). After further washing in TBS, each biotinylated
goat antimouse immunoglobulin G at a dilution of
1:100 was added to the slide, which was incubated for
20 minutes at room temperature. Finally, the sections
were washed again in TBS and incubated for 10 minutes in a solution of streptavidin-ABC-horseradish
peroxidase at a dilution of 1:100. Color development
was achieved using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Immunotech, Cedex, France). Finally, the
sections were counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin. Negative controls were processed as above without the primary antibody.
Evaluation of Immunostaining
Immunohistochemical evaluations were performed
independently by 2 pathologists (J.H. and S.L.) with
no knowledge of the clinical data. ERCC1 immunoreactivity levels in each case were assessed semiquantitatively under a light microscope. Representative
areas of the images were acquired at a magnification

1381

of 3400 for each specimen. Tumor nuclear staining
intensity was graded on a scale of 0 to 3 using adjacent nonmalignant cells as a reference (intensity 2).
Discordant cases were reviewed. A total of 100 to
1500 positive or negative tumor nuclei per specimen
were counted manually. The percentage of positive
tumor nuclei was calculated for each specimen, and
a proportional score was given (0 if 0%, 0.1 if 1%-9%,
0.5 if 10%-49%, and 1.0 if 50%), as previously
described.21,22 Then this proportional score was multiplied by the staining intensity of nuclei to obtain a
final semiquantitative H score. ERCC1-positive
tumors were defined as more than the median value
of all the H scores.

Statistical Analysis
Clinical and pathological variables were compared
across groups using the v2 or Fisher exact tests for
categorical variables. The duration of OS was calculated from the first day of neoadjuvant CCRT until the
date of death or the most recent documented followup. PFS was calculated from the first day of neoadjuvant CCRT to the day when disease progression was
recognized or the day of the last follow-up visit.
Patients who were alive at the last follow-up were censored at that time. Patients who were taken off study
or who died before progression were censored at the
time that they were taken off study. OS and PFS were
estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons between groups were performed using the logrank test for time-to-event variables. P-values less
than .05 were considered statistically significant. Multivariate analysis of the independent predictive or
prognostic factors for survival was performed using
the forward stepwise (likelihood-ratio statistics based
on the conditional parameter estimate) method of the
Cox proportional hazard regression model with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).

RESULTS
Characteristics of the Patients
The median age of the patients was 58 years (range,
33-72 years), and 71% were men. Forty-one patients
had adenocarcinomas (60%), and 26 had squamouscell carcinomas (38%). The chemotherapy regimens
were as follows: 32 patients were treated with oral
etoposide plus cisplatin combination chemotherapy
(47%), 29 with taxane (28 paclitaxel and 1 docetaxel)
plus cisplatin (43%), and 7 with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (10%) (Table 1). Thoracic radiotherapy was
administered as planned to all patients (100%). The
median duration of radiotherapy was 36 days (range,
32-47 days).

Assessment of ERCC1 Expression
ERCC1 expression was localized to the nucleus (Fig.
2). The median value of H scores was 1.0 (range, 0 to
3). ‘‘ERCC1 positive’’ was defined as an H-score of
more than 1.0 and was observed in 46% (31 of 68) of
patients. There were no significant differences in the
clinicopathological parameters, such as sex, age, performance status, histology type, T stage, or chemotherapeutic regimen, between the ERCC1-positive
and ERCC1 negative groups (Table 1).

Association of ERCC1 Expression With
Treatment Response
The clinical response to neoadjuvant CCRT before
surgery was reassessed for all patients as follows: 6
of 68 patients showed complete responses (CR, 9%),
51 showed partial responses (PR, 75%), and 11
showed stable disease (SD, 16%). The objective clinical response rate was 84%. ERCC1 expression in
patients with clinical objective responses, including
CR and PR, was not significantly different from that
in patients with SD and progressive disease (PD)
(P 5 .515; Table 2).
All 68 patients who completed neoadjuvant
CCRT underwent surgery and were assessable for
pathologic response. Pathologic complete responses
(pCR 95% necrosis plus fibrosis) were observed in
14 (21%) of all patients. There was no significant difference in pCR rate according to ERCC1 expression
(P 5 .818; Table 2). Surgical procedures included 50
lobectomies, 5 bilobectomies, 11 pneumonectomies,
and 2 exploratory thoracotomies. Thirty-nine (57%)
of the 68 patients who showed N down-staging after

CCRT also achieved TNM down-staging. Although
there were trends toward increased rates of achieving
N down-staging or undergoing lobectomies after
CCRT in patients with negative ERCC1 expression,
these differences failed to reach statistical significance (P 5 .171 and P 5 .123, respectively) (Table 2).

Association of ERCC1 Expression With PFS and OS
With a median follow-up of 61.8 months (range,
34.3-108.8 months), median PFS and OS were 18.0
months (95% CI, 13.9 months-22.1 months) and 29.0
months (95% CI, 17.9 months-40.1 months), respectively, for the total study population. Twenty-six
(38.2%) patients were alive and 42 (61.8%) had died
at the time of analysis. On univariate analysis, PFS
was 15.9 months for patients with ERCC1-positive

tumors and 29.5 months for those with ERCC1-negative tumors (P 5 .062; Fig. 3). Patients treated with
taxane-containing regimens had longer PFS than
those treated with etoposide-containing regimens
(28.8 vs 14.1 months, respectively; P 5 .003). PFS was
longer in patients who achieved T down-staging after
CCRT than in patients who did not (32.8 vs 16.4
months, respectively; P 5 .033; Table 3). However, OS
was significantly longer in the ERCC1-negative group
than in the ERCC1-positive group (89.2 vs 26.0
months, respectively; P 5 .014; Fig. 3). Other factors
affecting the prolongation of OS were the type of surgery (P 5 .017), the type of chemotherapy regimen (P
5 .003), and mediastinal nodal clearance (down-staging to pN0-1) after CCRT (P 5 .001) (Table 3). A Cox
proportional hazard model showed that negative
ERCC1 expression (hazard ratio, 0.483; 95% CI, 0.2400.970; P 5 .041) and the achievement of N down-staging after CCRT (hazard ratio, 0.384; 95% CI, 0.1960.754; P 5 .005) were independent prognostic factors
for the prolongation of survival (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
In this study, ERCC1 expression was positive in 46%
(31 of 68) of N2-positive NSCLC patients, which is
consistent with the results of a previous report.23
Pathologic complete response and pathologic mediastinal down-staging were observed in 14 (21%) and
39 (57%) of all patients, respectively. Among 14
patients who obtained pathologic complete response,
6 were positive for ERCC1expression and 8 were negative (P 5 .818). Of 39 patients who achieved pathologic mediastinal down-staging, 15 were ERCC1
expression positive and 24 were negative (P 5 .171).
It has been known that achievement of pathological
complete response and/or mediastinal down-staging
are the most important factors affecting prolongation

of survival in patients treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy andor radiotherapy followed by surgery.3,20,24,25 Our results showed that there was a
trend toward a higher rate of pathological complete
response and mediastinal nodal clearance in patients
with ERCC1-negative tumors after neoadjuvant CCRT
followed by surgery compared with patients with
ERCC1-positive tumors, but this did not reach statis-

tical significance (Table 2). This finding indicates
that ERCC1 expression may not be a predictive
marker for the pathological complete response to
neoadjuvant CCRT. However, because of the retrospective nature of the analysis, results should be cautiously interpreted and need to be validated in future
prospective studies with large numbers of patients.
However, it is noteworthy that ERCC1 expression
was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with stage IIIA N2-positive NSCLC
treated with neoadjuvant platinum-based CCRT followed by surgery, with a hazard ratio of 0.483 (95%
CI, 0.240-0.970) for ERCC1-negative patients (P 5
.041). The median survival for patients with low
ERCC1 expression was 89.2 months, compared with
26.0 months for patients with high ERCC1 expression
(P 5 .014). Given that resected NSCLC patients with
high ERCC1 expression have better survival when
compared with patients with low ERCC1 expression,26 our results suggest that patients with ERCC1negative tumors derived a substantial benefit from
neoadjuvant cisplatin-based CCRT, as compared with
patients with ERCC1-positive tumors.
Although ERCC1 expression has been associated
with radioresistance in an in vitro study,18 clinical
studies of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in NSCLC
are very limited. Considering the association between

ERCC1 as a Prognostic Marker in NSCLC/Hwang et al

ERCC1 and radioresistance, van de Vaart et al
reported that the level of induced DNA adducts in
buccal cells was strongly associated with outcome after definitive concomitant low-dose cisplatin and
radiotherapy for stage IIIA/B NSCLC. Patients with
higher adduct levels had a median survival of 30.2
months, compared with only 5.2 months in patients
with low adduct levels (P<.0001).27 In this context,
our study demonstrated for the first time that ERCC1
expression negativity would be an important prognostic marker for prolongation of survival in patients
treated with neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery.
However, only patients who achieved at least stable
disease and candidates for surgery after completion
of neoadjuvant CCRT were enrolled in this study.
Therefore, to define whether the presence or absence
of ERCC1 is a determinant of the sensitivity of
NSCLC to platinum and radiation, further prospective study is warranted for locally advanced NSCLC
patients treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and is currently underway.
ERCC1 is known to play a major role in removing platinum-induced DNA adducts in several
malignancies, including NSCLC. Many studies have
undertaken to determine whether ERCC1 expression
is related to OS after platinum-based chemotherapy
for NSCLC.16,23,27-31 In palliative chemotherapy for
advanced NSCLC, low levels of ERCC1 expression
are associated with prolonged survival. However, a
recent prospective phase III study reported that
there was no significant difference in survival
between low ERCC1 genotypic groups and high
ERCC1 genotypic groups.31 In adjuvant therapy for
stage I-III NSCLC, patients with ERCC1 negative
tumors appear to benefit from adjuvant cisplatinbased chemotherapy, whereas patients with ERCC1positive tumors do not.23 For patients with stage
IIB-IIIB NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus platinum chemotherapy followed by surgery, there was no correlation between ERCC1
mRNA expression and survival.32 These discrepancies between studies might be explained by the heterogeneous methods used to detect ERCC1
expression. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction has been most commonly used to detect ERCC1 expression, and is
highly sensitive and semiquantitative. However, it is
not always easy to obtain adequate amounts of
mRNA from fresh tumor samples, especially in
NSCLC. Therefore, immunohistochemical staining is
more popular and feasible in clinical practice,
despite several limitations, such as the different
antibodies used, interobserver or intraobserver variations, and the variable cutoff values for ERCC1

positivity. Nevertheless, a standardized method
remains to be established and validated with larger
series of patients in prospective studies.
This study has several limitations. First, it was
based on an unplanned and retrospective analysis.
Therefore, caution must be exercised in drawing firm
conclusions from the present study, which should be
prospectively validated with a large number of
patients. Second, during the study period, the chemotherapeutic regimens combined with radiation
were heterogeneous, although platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents were administered with radiotherapy in all patients. Although there was a
marginal significant difference in PFS for ERCC1positive (15.9 months) and ERCC1-negative (29.5
months) patients (P 5 .062), multivariate analysis
showed that a taxane-containing platinum combination regimen was the only independent prognostic
factor for the prolongation of PFS (hazard ratio
0.403, P 5 .004), suggesting that taxane-treated
patients have better survival. The biological mechanisms underlying survival difference between taxane/
platinum and etoposide/platinum combination therapy with radiation remain an evolving question at
this moment. In conclusion, this study shows that
patients with stage IIIA N2-positive NSCLC and
ERCC1 negative tumors have an apparent survival
benefit from neoadjuvant CCRT with a platinum-containing regimen. These results suggest that ERCC1
expression would be useful as a prognostic marker
for platinum-based CCRT in NSCLC patients.
