BACKGROUND: In a phase 3, randomized, open-label trial (Pazopanib versus Sunitinib in the Treatment of Locally Advanced and/or
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma, COMPARZ; NCT00720941), pazopanib was found to be noninferior to sunitinib in terms of
progression-free survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with no prior therapy. Overall treatment differences were
evaluated in a post hoc analysis with a quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) methodology. METHODS: Each
patient’s overall survival was partitioned into 3 mutually exclusive health states: time with grade 3 or 4 toxicity (TOX), time without
symptoms of disease or grade 3/4 toxicity of treatment, and time after tumor progression or relapse (REL). The time spent in each
state was weighted by a health-state utility associated with that state and summed to calculate the Q-TWiST. A threshold utility analysis was used, and utilities were applied across the range of 0 (similar to death) to 1 (perfect health). RESULTS: A total of 1110
patients were enrolled (557 on pazopanib and 553 on sunitinib). The mean TOX was 31 days (95% confidence interval, 13-48 days) longer for sunitinib versus pazopanib. In the threshold utility analysis, the difference in the Q-TWiST ranged from –11 days (utility for TOX,
1; utility for REL, 0) to 43 days (utility for TOX, 0; utility for REL, 1) in favor of pazopanib across most utility combinations. Differences
were significant in less than half of the utility combinations examined, and this typically occurred when the utility for TOX was lower
than the utility for REL. CONCLUSIONS: Patients randomized to pazopanib had a slightly longer Q-TWiST in comparison with sunitiC 2016 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Pazopanib and sunitinib are oral angiogenesis inhibitors approved for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic
renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).1,2 Pazopanib versus Sunitinib in the Treatment of Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (COMPARZ) was a phase 3, randomized, open-label trial designed to assess the noninferiority of
pazopanib versus sunitinib in patients with mRCC without prior systemic therapy (NCT00720941 and
NCT01147822).3,4 The primary noninferiority endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The median PFS was
found to be similar between the 2 arms,3 and the median overall survival (OS) was 28.3 months for pazopanib and 29.1
months for sunitinib (hazard ratio for death with pazopanib vs sunitinib, 0.92; stratified log-rank P 5 .24).4
Although it was anticipated that the 2 targeted drugs would have similar efficacy, data were collected to evaluate
potential differences in secondary endpoints of safety and quality of life (QOL). In comparison with the PFS findings, the
safety and QOL profiles favored pazopanib. Adverse events (AEs) of any grade were reported more frequently (>5%) with
sunitinib versus pazopanib, and significance was found for hand-foot syndrome, mucosal inflammation, stomatitis, hypothyroidism, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, epistaxis, and fatigue. Similarly, QOL analyses suggested a benefit from pazopanib for
many of the QOL domains, including fatigue and soreness of the mouth, throat, hands, and feet.3

A further step for examining the differences between
pazopanib and sunitinib would be to conduct a qualityadjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST)
analysis. The Q-TWiST method allows a broad estimate
of treatment differences that incorporates OS, progression, toxicities, and health-related QOL.5-7 The survival
time can be partitioned into different health states: time
with grade 3 or 4 toxicity (TOX), time without symptoms
of disease or grade 3/4 toxicity of treatment (TWiST),
and time after tumor progression or relapse (REL). The
time spent in each state is then weighted by a health-state
utility associated with that state and summed to calculate

the Q-TWiST. If data are not available for estimating the
health utility for each state, a sensitivity-threshold analysis
can be conducted in which the utilities for each nonTWiST state are varied across a range of values.
Although comparisons between pazopanib and sunitinib have been conducted with survival, safety, and QOL
as distinct endpoints, little is known about the health utility of each state for pazopanib versus sunitinib. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to use a Q-TWiST analysis to
evaluate the overall effect of pazopanib and sunitinib
treatment differences on the quality of survival for
patients with mRCC.

This phase 3, open-label, noninferiority trial randomly
assigned patients with clear cell mRCC to treatment with
pazopanib or sunitinib. Patients were randomized in a 1:1
ratio to receive a continuous dose of pazopanib (800 mg/
day with no days off) or sunitinib in 6-week cycles (50 mg/
day for 4 weeks and then 2 weeks without treatment). The
primary noninferiority endpoint of PFS was met,3 and OS
was similar for the 2 arms.4 The Consolidated Standards
of Reporting Trials diagram for this trial is provided in
Figure 1. The study was approved by the institutional
review board or ethics committee at each participating center and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of
the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice
guidelines. Additional details about the study procedures,
including the ethics review, are described elsewhere.3

The OS time was partitioned into 3 health states: TOX,
TWiST, and REL. TOX was defined as the sum of all
time spent with grade 3 or 4 AEs; gaps and AEs that
occurred after progression were excluded. The toxicity
time periods for an individual patient did not need to be
contiguous. For example, if patient A experienced a toxicity for 8 days in cycle 1, 3 days in cycle 2, and 12 days in
cycle 5, then the TOX was 23 days. Furthermore, TOX
counted calendar time, so if a patient experienced grade 3
nausea and grade 3 fatigue for the same 4-day period, this
counted as 4 days toward TOX, not 8. REL was defined
as the OS less the PFS. All remaining time was part of the
TWiST period, that is, before progression or death and
without grade 3 or 4 AEs. For OS, the date for the data
cutoff was May 2012. PFS was assessed by independent
review. Exploratory analyses included lower grade toxicities in the toxicity state definition.
Safety

All AEs were graded according to the National Cancer
Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0).8 Any AEs occurring after progression
were not included. Cardiac function was monitored with
electrocardiograms or multigated acquisition scans every
3 cycles. The time with grade 5 AEs before death was
included in the analysis; however, these AEs made up only
1% of the AEs analyzed.

Event and censoring times for OS and PFS followed the
definitions of the main trial statistical analysis plan.
Estimates were restricted to the first 600 days of follow-up
(ie, the approximate median follow-up time), and mean
estimates are, therefore, called restricted means.
The time spent in each health state was weighted by
the health-state utility associated with that state and then
summed to calculate the Q-TWiST. Health-state utility
values range from 0 (equivalent to death) to 1 (perfect

health). It is common practice to assume a weight of 1.0
for the TWiST state, with other states discounted from
1.0. Although not all patients in the TWiST state value
their health as perfect, anchoring health states to a perfect
TWiST score is a useful way to compare treatment arms
with respect to differences in time living with toxicity and
disease progression.
Because the COMPARZ study did not administer a
health utility measure, a sensitivity-threshold analysis was
conducted in which the utilities for each non-TWiST
state were varied across the entire range of 0 to 1 to show
the full range of possible results depending on the utility
values assigned to TOX and REL. Health-state utility values from the literature were used to interpret the threshold
analysis through the identification of the values that were

most consistent with the literature. Finally, the difference
between treatment arms in the mean Q-TWiST was calculated, and the bootstrap was used to calculate P values
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS
A total of 1110 patients were enrolled (557 on pazopanib
and 553 on sunitinib) in the COMPARZ trial. Patients
were predominantly male (71% on pazopanib and 75%
on sunitinib), had lung metastases at the baseline (76% on
pazopanib and 77% on sunitinib), and had a Karnofsky
performance status score of 90 or 100 (75% on pazopanib
and 76% on sunitinib). Additional baseline demographic
and disease characteristics are presented in Table 1.6
The median overall follow-up time was approximately 600 days; therefore, the restricted Q-TWiST estimates were calculated with this cutoff. The restricted
mean health-state durations before utility weighting are
listed in Table 2. The mean number of days for TOX was
31 days longer in the sunitinib arm versus the pazopanib

arm. This difference was offset by the reduction of
TWiST and REL. The partitioned survival plots are presented in Figure 2.
The threshold analysis is presented in Table 3 and
Figure 3. The difference in Q-TWiST ranged from –11
days to 43 days, nearly always in favor of pazopanib. For
example, when TOX was weighted at 0.5 with respect to
TWiST and REL was also weighted at 0.5, the Q-TWiST
difference between the arms was 16 days (95% CI, –4 to
36) in favor of pazopanib but was not significantly different from zero. When TOX was weighted at 0.75 and REL
was weighted at 0.5, the Q-TWiST difference was 9 days
(95% CI, –12 to 29); again, this was in favor of pazopanib
but was not significantly different from zero. Only 3 of

the 25 utility combinations examined favored sunitinib
(nonsignificantly): TOX at 1 with REL at 0 or 0.25 and
TOX at 0.75 with REL at 0. Differences were statistically
significant for fewer than half of the utility combinations
examined; significant differences were typically observed
when the utility weight for toxicity was less than the utility
weight for REL, as demonstrated by the darker shading in
the lower right corner of the threshold plot (Fig. 3). For
example, when TOX was weighted at 0.5 and REL was
weighted at 1.0, the Q-TWiST difference was 28 days
(95% CI, 8-48 days) in favor of pazopanib.
The analyses were repeated with toxicities of grade 2
or higher for the TOX state. The restricted mean healthstate durations are listed in Table 4. The mean number of
days for TOX was now only 20 days longer in the sunitinib arm versus the pazopanib arm. This difference was
again offset by the reduction of TWiST and REL. The
partitioned survival plots are presented in Figure 4.
The threshold analysis is presented in Table 5 and
Figure 5. The difference in Q-TWiST ranged from –11
days to 33 days, and this was nearly always in favor of
pazopanib. Differences were statistically significant for
very few utility combinations. For values of 0.5 for both
the toxicity and progression states, the estimated
Q-TWiST difference was 11 days (95% CI, –7 to 28) in
favor of pazopanib, but this was not statistically
significant.
DISCUSSION
The Q-TWiST approach with a threshold analysis evaluated all possible combinations of health-state utility
weights applied to toxicity or progression. This report is
the first study to use a Q-TWiST analysis to examine the
survival quality for pazopanib versus sunitinib. Several
combinations of weights for toxicity or progression significantly favored pazopanib. In contrast, no combination of
weights significantly favored sunitinib.
Pazopanib-treated patients had slightly longer clinical benefits according to Q-TWiST scores in comparison

with sunitinib-treated patients, primarily because of a
reduced TOX. This difference (–11 to 43 days depending
on the utility combination) was <10% of OS (median,
28 months). Therefore, although there was a statistically
significant benefit for pazopanib versus sunitinib in
Q-TWiST analyses, the magnitude of that difference
tended to be rather small.
Similarly, under certain conditions of the weight or
value patients place on toxicity over progression, pazopanib demonstrated superior Q-TWiST in comparison with
sunitinib. A large proportion of the significant results
occurred in combinations in which REL was weighted
similarly to TWiST, and these may not be clinically reasonable combinations. Scenarios in which REL or TOX

Compared with patients on sunitinib, patients on pazopanib had longer PFS after we had accounted for the total
time with significant toxicity. However, when toxicities
included AEs that were grade 2 or higher, there were fewer
significant Q-TWiST differences between pazopanib and
sunitinib.
When one is conducting Q-TWiST analyses, it is important to identify the relevant health-state utility values to
provide meaningful interpretations of the threshold analyses. In a previous study of mRCC in the general public, the
following health-state utility ratings were obtained: for stable disease, 0.795; for progressive disease, 0.355; for grade
1/2 fatigue, 0.751; and for grade 3 hand-foot syndrome,
0.469.9 These values support an approximate relative utility of 0.5 for both the toxicity and progression states,
which corresponds to an estimated Q-TWiST difference of
16 days (95% CI, –4 to 36) in favor of pazopanib.

Figure 5. Threshold plot with toxicity defined as grade 2 or
higher. Integers represent the estimated difference in the
quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity between
arms (in weeks) for the corresponding combination of utilities for toxicity and progression. Orange-shaded areas are
significantly different from zero in favor of pazopanib; tanshaded areas indicate no significant difference.

An interpretation of the magnitude of Q-TWiST differences should consider OS and time to progression. In a scenario in which the OS or time to progression is shorter,
smaller differences in Q-TWiST may be meaningful. General
guidelines with respect to OS have been developed on the basis of a review of the oncology clinical trial literature, and they
suggest that Q-TWiST differences of 10% to 15% of OS are
clinically important.6 Differences of 5% may be meaningful
in some settings. The difference seen in this study corresponds to <5% of OS. At present, there are no guidelines for
the interpretation of Q-TWiST scores with respect to PFS;
however, such guidelines, if established, could potentially
prove useful in settings such as this, where little survival difference is anticipated and the primary concerns lie with balancing disease symptoms and treatment toxicities.
A few limitations are worth noting. First, the AEs
and related grades of toxicity used were obtained from the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, which is a provider-driven assessment.10 A more patient-centric paradigm may be useful
when one is assessing safety. For example, the National
Cancer Institute’s Patient-Reported Outcomes version of
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events10
would be a useful complement to physician ratings of
safety and would help yield a more comprehensive rating
1114

of health-state utilities of pazopanib versus sunitinib. Second, the accuracy of AE start and end dates used to calculate the duration of TOX is unknown. Finally, the utility
weights used for toxicities in our analysis were obtained
from a study that queried the general public. However,
AEs such as fatigue and mucositis seem to have a profound
and persistent effect on patients (ie, there is little adaptation over time).11,12 This effect could be missed or not
reflected in the public assessments. On the other hand,
utility values based on general population estimates tend
to provide lower (ie, worse) ratings than those obtained
from cancer patients.
This study illustrates the usefulness of the QTWiST analytic approach as a quality-adjusted survival
model when one is evaluating treatments for advanced
cancer. For some utility weight combinations, patients
randomized to pazopanib had a slightly longer Q-TWiST
than sunitinib patients, and this was primarily due to
reduced TOX. For many other utility weight combinations, there were no differences, and for only a few, sunitinib was preferred. These findings underscore the
competing benefits and risks of pazopanib versus sunitinib and may help to guide treatment decision making for
patients with mRCC and their providers.
