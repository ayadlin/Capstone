Large, Clinic-Based Case-Control Study

BACKGROUND: Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications with pleiotropic effects, including alterations in growth signaling, as well
as immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects that may alter cancer risk. Evidence from previous epidemiologic studies is
inconsistent about whether statin use is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (PC). METHODS: Patients with confirmed
diagnoses of PC (cases) were recruited from medical and surgical oncology clinics, with controls (frequency-matched by sex and
age) recruited from general medicine clinics, at a high-volume academic medical center over a 6-year period (2006-2011). Direct
interviews were conducted with an epidemiological risk factor questionnaire covering topics such as medical history, lifestyle factors,
and medication usage. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as estimates of the relative risk of PC. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 536 cases and 869 controls. Ever use of statins
was associated with a 34% reduced PC risk (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47-0.92). In sex-stratified analyses, risk was statistically significantly
reduced in men only (OR for men, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32-0.79; OR for women, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.52-1.43). Duration of use was inversely
associated with PC risk (>10-year use: overall OR, 0.51; OR for men, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.80; Ptrend 5 .006). CONCLUSIONS: This is the
largest case-control study to demonstrate an inverse association between statin use and PC risk. Risk reduction in statin users
appears to be sex-specific and is more pronounced in long-term users. Further research is warranted to better characterize this assoC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
In 2014, pancreatic cancer (PC) represented the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related mortality among US adults, with a
projected 46,420 new cases and 39,590 deaths.1 Approximately 75% of patients die within 1 year after their diagnosis,
and the 5-year survival rate is 6%.1 Only 15% to 20% of patients have potentially operable tumors at diagnosis; the majority present with incurable locally advanced or metastatic disease.2 Population-based risk-reduction strategies require an
improved understanding of the factors that modulate risk (particularly modifiable factors). Known and suggested risk factors include male sex, increasing age, African American ethnicity, smoking, obesity, type 2 diabetes, pancreatitis, and a
family history of PC.3
Statin medications, currently indicated for coronary heart disease and its risk equivalents,4 lower serum cholesterol
levels via competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis). Recently updated preventive health guidelines vastly expand the cohort of US adults deemed likely to
benefit from statins.5 Because of their pleiotropic effects, they have been of considerable interest for cancer prevention and
treatment. Data safety analyses of early randomized controlled trials of statins revealed an inverse association between statin use and cancer incidence.6 Preclinical studies have demonstrated growth-suppressive effects on various tumors, and
epidemiologic studies have shown inverse associations with overall cancer risk7,8 and the risk of other gastrointestinal cancers, including esophageal,9 colorectal,10 and liver cancer.11
Previous studies of statin use and PC risk are inconsistent. Some randomized controlled trials and cohorts were
underpowered,12-17 and among nontrial studies,7,18-26 few examined associations by sex with the exception of a large study
of predominantly male veterans26 and a UK study19 in which inverse relationships were observed only in men and male
smokers, respectively.

Original Article

To further examine the association between the use
of statin medications and PC risk among women and men
combined and separately, we analyzed data collected in
our large, clinic-based case-control study of PC in the San
Francisco Bay Area, Calif. Because antineoplastic effects
may vary with drug characteristics,27,28 we also explored
differential effects of statins individually and grouped by
pharmacologic properties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

Eligible patients diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma were recruited primarily from the University
of California San Francisco (UCSF) gastrointestinal medical and surgical oncology clinics (n 5 463); they were
supplemented by recruitment from San Francisco’s California Pacific Medical Center (n 5 46) and the Cancer
Prevention Institute of California’s early case ascertainment in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties (n 5 27). Eligible cases were US residents who were 21 to 85 years old
at diagnosis and able to complete a direct interview (ie,
they spoke English and had no cognitive impairment).
Diagnoses were confirmed with patients’ medical records,
a cancer registry, and Surveillance Epidemiology and End
Results abstracts that included histologic or cytologic confirmation of diagnoses. Controls were recruited from
UCSF general medicine primary care clinics and were
frequency-matched to cases by sex and age in 5-year
groups. The eligibility criteria for controls were the same
as those for cases with the exception of a PC diagnosis. All
participants were enrolled from 2006 to 2011 and provided informed consent for interviews and biospecimen
collection. Cases provided additional consent for medical
record access of data pertaining to their disease and
follow-up telephone contact. The study was approved by
the UCSF committee on human research.
Data Collection

Data were collected during direct interviews with a standard epidemiologic risk factor questionnaire; queries for
most exposures were restricted to >1 year before the diagnosis (cases) or interview (controls). No proxy interviews
were conducted. Specifically for these analyses, participants were asked whether they had ever been diagnosed
with hypercholesterolemia and whether they had ever
taken prescription hypolipidemic medications for 4
days per week for 3 months (if so, they were asked for
their age at first use, their age at last use, and the total duration of use). Cue cards with brand and generic medication names helped to facilitate recall.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). Preliminary analyses were conducted with parametric and nonparametric statistics. Ages
at the time of the PC diagnosis (cases) or the interview
(controls) were grouped as follows: 50, 51 to 60, 61 to
70, and >70 years. Body mass index (BMI) was computed
as usual adult weight/height2 (kg/m2) and grouped
according to World Health Organization categories. Alcohol consumption was analyzed as average drinks per week
over the past 10 years, and cigarette smoking was analyzed
as never smoker, quit > 15 years ago, quit 1 to 15 years
ago, and quit < 1 year ago/current smoker.
Hypolipidemic medication use was analyzed by
drug class and was grouped into mutually exclusive categories of use: never, nonstatins, nonstatins and statins,
and statins only. Drug-specific analyses were limited to
exclusive use of that medication. Never users of hypolipidemics constituted the referent group in all analyses.
Exploratory analyses of the pharmacologic properties of specific statins included potency (recommended
starting dose: 20-40 vs 10-20 mg/day), derivation (biologic vs synthetic), bioavailability (5% vs 12%), solubility (lipophilic vs hydrophilic), phase 1 metabolism
(CYP450 3A4 vs other), the production of active metabolites (none/minor vs major), renal excretion (10% vs
13%), and half-life (<3 vs >11 hours).29 Users of multiple statins that crossed categories within a pharmacologic property were analyzed as “mixed use.”
Multivariable unconditional logistic regression was
used to compute odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) as estimates of relative risk. Models were
adjusted for matching factors or for all potential confounders of PC (age, sex, race, body mass index, alcohol,
tobacco, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, pancreatitis,
family history of PC, and duration of statin use for statin
subgroup analyses), and they are henceforth called
adjusted or fully adjusted, respectively. Ever use of nonstatin hypolipidemics did not change risk estimates > 10%
and, therefore, was not included in the final models. Linear trends in ORs were based on the Wald chi-square statistic for the factor modeled as an ordinal variable. Effect
modification by sex was explored in stratified analyses.
Demographic characteristics of non-UCSF cases were
similar to those of UCSF cases, and sensitivity analyses
showed similar results for analyses of all cases and for
UCSF cases only. Thus, the total case population was
used for all analyses. Data were not tabulated for 5
exposed participants. All statistical tests were 2-sided and
considered statistically significant at P < .05.

RESULTS
Of potentially eligible cases who were 21 to 85 years old,
approximately 12% were ineligible because of language
problems, and approximately 3% were cognitively
impaired, not located, or dead; this left 698 eligible PC
cases. Sixteen percent of these cases refused, 6% were too
ill, and 2% expressed privacy concerns or participation in
another study; this led to a final participation rate of 76%.
Cases were recruited at a median of 61 days after their PC
diagnosis (interquartile range, 25-148 days). Among controls, approximately 34% of patients who were
approached did not meet eligibility requirements (eg, language problems or an incompatible age group). Among eligible clinic controls, 35% had no time, 3% refused, 6%
were too ill, and 3% had privacy concerns; this led to a
final participation rate of 53%. These analyses include the

eligible 536 cases and 869 frequency-matched controls
who completed interviews.
Compared with controls, cases were slightly older,
and a greater proportion were men, consumed alcohol,
were overweight or obese, or had type 2 diabetes or pancreatitis (Table 1). Nearly half of both cases and controls
reported a history of hypercholesterolemia.
Hypolipidemics were ever used by 34.0% of cases
and 36.9% of controls (Table 2). Statins were the most
commonly used (32.6% of cases and 35.7% of controls),
and 23.9% of statin users took 2 or more different statins.
Both cases and controls with type 2 diabetes were more
likely to have hypercholesterolemia and use cholesterollowering drugs, including statins. Notably, one-third of
the 39 statin users without hypercholesterolemia had type
2 diabetes, and 180 patients with hypercholesterolemia
never used statins.
Ever use of statins was associated with a reduced PC
risk (adjusted OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47-0.92; Table 3).
Sex-stratified analyses showed that this was mainly due to
the association in men (adjusted OR for men, 0.50; 95%
CI, 0.32-0.79; adjusted OR for women, 0.86; 95% CI,
0.52-1.43). In contrast, use of other hypolipidemics was
not associated with PC risk regardless of exclusivity of use,
although estimates were imprecise.
Duration of statin use was inversely associated with
risk, particularly among long-term users (>10-year use:

fully adjusted OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31-0.85; Ptrend 5 .01;
Table 3). Age at first use was not associated with PC risk in
fully adjusted models and did not confound the association
between PC risk and duration of use (Table 3). The median age at first use in men (57 years; interquartile range,
50-64 years) was similar to that in women (58 years; interquartile range, 52-65 years; data not tabulated). In sexstratified analyses, a trend of reduced risk with increased
duration of use was statistically significant in men only
(men, Ptrend 5 .006; women, Ptrend 5 .44; Table 3).
Atorvastatin was the most common exclusively used
statin (Table 4). Only exclusive pravastatin use was associated with a statistically significant decreased PC risk (fully
adjusted OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.06-0.82), and the magnitude of the OR was similar for men and women, although
imprecise. Use of multiple statins was associated with a
56% reduced PC risk, and this was statistically significant
in men only (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.86). Among
those who took multiple statins, 86.2% used atorvastatin,
and 72.4% used simvastatin.
Exploratory analyses of the pharmacologic characteristics of statins disclosed few associations with PC risk
(Table 5) with the exception of drug bioavailability. Com1290

pared with those who exclusively used statins with low bioavailability (5%), those who exclusively used highbioavailability (12%) statins had a reduced risk of PC
(P 5 .01). However, this was observed in men only (men,
P 5 .01; women, P 5 .26). Interestingly, participants in
the mixed-use group were at lowest risk and were the only
group with a statistically significantly decreased risk in
comparison with nonusers. Other pharmacologic characteristics were not associated with risk in comparison with
nonusers or in comparisons of high- and low-intensity exposure. However, those in the mixed-use groups for derivation, renal excretion, and elimination had statistically
significantly reduced PC risk in comparison with
nonusers.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest published casecontrol study to demonstrate an inverse association
between statin use and PC risk and to conduct detailed
analyses by sex and pharmacologic properties. Associations were observed in men only. PC risk was inversely
associated with the duration of statin use and was lowest
in male long-term users regardless of age at first use. The

decreased risk of PC with exclusive pravastatin use was
novel to our study; it requires confirmation and should be
interpreted cautiously.
Statins are hypothesized to decrease cancer risk
partly via the downstream effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibition in the mevalonate pathway. Specifically, inhibition disrupts the synthesis of cholesterol and farnesyl or geranylgeranyl
diphosphates, which function in prenylation of the Gproteins Rho and Ras as well as other proteins involved in
cell signaling.6,30,31 It is relevant to PC that aberrant Ras
signaling is integral to pancreatic tumorigenesis,32,33
whereas Rho mediates epidermal growth factor signaling
and is implicated in other cancer-related mechanisms,
including angiogenesis,34,35 tumor invasion and metastasis,36,37 and activation of the nuclear factor jB pathway.38
Statins also might affect cancer development via other
direct anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
effects.6,39 Interestingly, results from recent meta-analyses
of randomized controlled trial data show that statins may
reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis and increase diabetes
risk,40 and these conditions are associated with increased
PC risk. The association between statin use and cancer is
complex, organ-dependent, and confounded by intermediary health conditions requiring carefully designed studies to better understand the mechanisms driving the
observed pleiotropy.
Our findings of sex-specific associations expand on
results from a large, nested case-control study of predominantly male US veterans that showed statistically significantly reduced PC risk in statin users (OR, 0.33) and
particularly long-term users (>4 years; OR, 0.20)26 as
well as a recent UK case-control study that reported a

reduced risk of PC with statin use among male smokers
(OR, 0.11).19 Other studies that reported null associations with PC risk7,18,20,21,25 typically had matched by sex
and had too few cases to conduct sex-stratified analyses.
However, earlier results for all-cause mortality and stroke
in which decreased rates were observed in men only41,42
provide additional evidence of statins’ sex-specific effects.
Integration of the accumulating data suggests sex-related
effects of statins, including potential antineoplastic associations. Underlying mechanisms to explain these differences are uncertain and poorly understood. With few
published studies of women, further research is
warranted.
Our detailed analyses of the pharmacologic properties of statins are unique to our study. Results were null
from earlier analyses that assessed medication derivation
or solubility.43,44 Our observed inverse associations with
bioavailability are intriguing but could be spurious
because the lowest PC risk was observed among those in
the mixed group of users. Overall, our results do not suggest that specific pharmacologic characteristics might confer an exceptionally low PC risk.
The strengths of this study include the large sample
size; the short duration between case diagnosis and interview; and the experienced, well-trained interviewers who
administered a structured questionnaire in person to collect data about potential and known confounders, effect
modifiers, and risk factors for PC in a standard manner.
Data about most exposures excluded the year before the
diagnosis/interview to diminish effects of reverse causation. Cancer registry and medical record data were used to
confirm PC diagnoses. Study limitations include the
potential for recall bias inherent in case-control studies,

although direct interviews and the use of cue cards to facilitate recall helped to diminish exposure misclassification.
A potential for selection bias among controls is possible
because a high frequency of controls “had no time” or
could only partially complete an interview during the
clinic visit. Our use of clinic-based controls, which in
comparison with population-based controls may include
a greater prevalence of unhealthy persons (ie, smokers),
also may have influenced our findings, although our controls were largely being seen for acute conditions or
healthy annual examinations. Also, UCSF is a tertiary care
center, and cancer patients are often referred for surgery
or clinical trial consideration; these options generally ne1292

cessitate a good functional status. In comparison with
2006-2011 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
data for PC patients in the San Francisco–Oakland standard metropolitan statistical area,45 a greater proportion of
study patients were non-Hispanic white (85% vs 61%),
were younger at diagnosis (median age, 63 vs 70 years),
and had earlier stage disease at diagnosis (regional stage,
42% vs 34%; advanced stage, 41% vs 56%). Thus, our
results may pertain to a healthier population of PC
patients in comparison with the broader community.
Finally, statins have been previously associated with
increased adherence to preventive health measures,46 and
this suggests that statin use may be a surrogate for a

healthier lifestyle or better functional status. This potential bias should be considered in the interpretation of our
findings, although we adjusted for potential confounding
due to lifestyle factors associated with increased risk for
PC such as obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption in
our analyses.
In conclusion, this represents the largest case-control
study to demonstrate an inverse relationship between statin use and PC risk, particularly in men and in long-term
users. The prospective clinical evaluation of statins as preventive therapy (eg, in individuals at particularly high risk
for PC) represents an intriguing possibility.
