Abstract
CHK2 is a checkpoint kinase involved in the ATM-mediated response to double-strand DNA breaks. Its
potential as a drug target is still unclear, but inhibitors of CHK2 may increase the efficacy of genotoxic cancer
therapies in a p53 mutant background by eliminating one of the checkpoints or DNA repair pathways
contributing to cellular resistance. We report here the identification and characterization of a novel CHK2
kinase inhibitor, CCT241533. X-ray crystallography confirmed that CCT241533 bound to CHK2 in the ATP
pocket. This compound inhibits CHK2 with an IC50 of 3 nmol/L and shows minimal cross-reactivity against a
panel of kinases at 1 mmol/L. CCT241533 blocked CHK2 activity in human tumor cell lines in response to DNA
damage, as shown by inhibition of CHK2 autophosphorylation at S516, band shift mobility changes, and HDMX
degradation. CCT241533 did not potentiate the cytotoxicity of a selection of genotoxic agents in several cell lines.
However, this compound significantly potentiates the cytotoxicity of two structurally distinct PARP inhibitors.
Clear induction of the pS516 CHK2 signal was seen with a PARP inhibitor alone, and this activation was
abolished by CCT241533, implying that the potentiation of PARP inhibitor cell killing by CCT241533 was due to
inhibition of CHK2. Consequently, our findings imply that CHK2 inhibitors may exert therapeutic activity in
combination with PARP inhibitors. Cancer Res; 71(2); 463–72. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The cell responds to genotoxic stress via a complex integrated network of signaling pathways and checkpoints. DNA
damage is sensed by either the MRN/ATM/CHK2 pathway
(double-strand breaks, DSB) or the ATRIP/ATR/CHK1 pathway (single-strand breaks, SSB; ref. 1) and there is cross-talk at
multiple levels. Pathway activation initiates DNA repair,
induces cell-cycle arrest until repair is completed and primes
both the p53-dependent and independent apoptotic pathways
(2, 3).

Detection of DNA DSBs by the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1
(MRN) complex leads to the activation of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase, which can then phosphorylate
CHK2 on threonine 68 (T68). This phosphorylation allows
CHK2 to dimerize and autophosphorylate in the trans position
at threonines 383 and 387, resulting in full activation, and
autophosphorylation in the cis position at serine 516 (4, 5).
Once active, CHK2 phosphorylates a wide range of targets
involved in control of the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis
(2, 3). Cell-cycle arrest can be achieved through the inhibitory
phosphorylation of members of the CDC25 phosphatase
family, factors required to activate cyclin-dependent kinases
and drive the cell cycle forward (6). A main role of CHK2 in
DNA repair is to promote the homologous recombination
(HR) pathway via BRCA1 (7). Another downstream target of
the CHK2 kinase is the tumor-suppressor protein p53. When
stabilized by phosphorylation, either directly by CHK2 or
through intermediate proteins, p53 can transcriptionally activate many factors required for cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair,
and apoptosis (8).
The utility of conventional DNA-damaging anticancer drugs
is limited by protective mechanisms conferred by cell-cycle
checkpoints and DNA repair pathways in tumors as well as
deleterious side effects on normal tissue. It has been suggested
that abrogating the G2 checkpoint may increase the efficacy of
genotoxic agents preferentially in p53-deficient backgrounds, as
normal tissue would be rescued at the p53-dependent G1/S
checkpoint (3, 9, 10). There is increasing evidence that this is the

case for inhibitors of CHK1 (11–16), but the case for CHK2 is still
unclear and may depend on the cell line and cytotoxic agent
employed (17–23). However, in cells that possess a functional
p53 pathway, there is evidence that CHK2 inhibitors protect
against apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation (IR) and taxol
(21, 24–27), presumably by blocking CHK2-dependent activation
of p53. This additional protection of normal tissue could make
CHK2 inhibitors attractive therapeutic agents.
We report the identification of CCT241533, a potent and
selective ATP competitive inhibitor of CHK2. We show that
CCT241533 blocks the genotoxic activation of CHK2 in 3 cell
lines exhibiting confirmed functional CHK2 activity. In view of
the lack of clarity regarding the role of CHK2 inhibition in p53
mutant cells, a rigorous evaluation of the effects of CCT241533
in p53-compromised tumor cells was conducted. Studies with
CCT241533 in combination with several different genotoxic
anticancer agents, which activate CHK2, showed that inhibition of CHK2 activity did not enhance drug cytotoxicity. In
contrast, CCT241533 potentiated the cytotoxicity of PARP
inhibitors in p53 defective tumor cells concomitantly with
the inhibition of several CHK2 biomarkers.

Materials and Methods
Compounds and ionizing radiation
CCT241533 was synthesized as described (28). Mitomycin C
(MMC) and bleomycin were obtained from Kyowa Kirin.
AG14447 was synthesized in-house (29). Olaparib was purchased from JS Research Chemicals Trading. All other compounds were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. IR
was generated using an AGO HS 320kV X-ray system (AGO
Installations Ltd) set at 250 kV and 10 mA and used at 1 or 1.5
Gy/min.
CHK2 enzyme assays
CCT241533 activity against recombinant human CHK2
kinase activity was measured as previously described (28).
Kinome profile
Kinase profiling was carried out at The National Centre for
Protein Kinase Profiling (MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit,
Dundee, United Kingdom), using 20 mmol/L ATP and a fixed
concentration of 1 mmol/L test compound.
Crystallography
Expression and purification of the kinase domain of human
CHK2 was carried out as previously described (30). Crystals of
CHK2 bound to the inhibitor were generated as described in
the Supplementary Material.
Cells
The human colon cancer cell lines HT-29, HCT-116, breast
cancer line MCF7, glioblastoma line U-87 MG, ovarian cancer
lines OVCAR-3, OVCAR-5, IGROV, and OVCAR-8, osteosarcoma line U-2 OS, lung carcinoma cell line A549, prostate
cancer line LNCaP, and cervical cancer line HeLa were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The human
ovarian cancer cell line A2780 was obtained from ECACC

464

Cancer Res; 71(2) January 15, 2011

(Sigma-Aldrich), and the human ovarian cancer cell line CH1
was derived in-house (31). Cells were grown in DMEM or RPMI
1640 containing 10% FBS (PAA "Gold") and 5 mmol/L glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 C and
passaged for up to 6 months prior to renewal from frozen
stocks as indicated. Cells were regularly screened for Mycoplasma by PCR (VenorGem, Minerva Biolabs).
Cell growth inhibition assays
Cells were plated in 96-well or 6-well plates and allowed to
attach for 36 hours to ensure exponential growth at the time of
treatment. Growth inhibition was determined using a 96-hour
(4 cell-doublings) SRB assay and the growth inhibitory IC50
(GI50) values were derived as previously described (32).
Colony-forming assays
Cells were plated out at appropriate concentrations and
allowed to attach for at least 16 hours before addition of drugs.
After 7 to 10 days, colonies were fixed, stained, and counted by
eye or Image J software (NIH).
Cell-cycle analysis
Ethanol-fixed cells were washed with PBS, treated with
RNase, stained with propidum iodide, and analyzed on a
BD LSR II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Cell-cycle
analysis (Watson pragmatic model) was carried out using
FlowJo software (Treestar Inc.).
Apoptosis assay
Cells were harvested using Accutase (Sigma) and stained for
Annexin V, using Annexin V-FITC from eBioscience, according
to the manufacturer's protocol, and analyzed on a BD LSR II
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Data analysis was done
with FlowJo software (Treestar Inc.).
Potentiation assays
Cells were exposed to a fixed concentration (GI50) of
CCT241533 in combination with increasing concentrations
of either PARP inhibitor or cytotoxic drug in a 96-hour SRB
assay or 7- to 10-day colony-forming assay. The ability of
CCT241533 to enhance cell killing was expressed as a potentiation index (PI), which was the ratio of GI50 for the genotoxic
or PARP inhibitor alone and GI50 for the genotoxic or PARP
inhibitor in combination with a CHK2 inhibitor. Thus PI > 1
indicates potentiation and PI < 1 indicates protection.
Immunoblot assays
Western blotting was carried out as previously described
(13). Antibodies used were: total CHK2 (sc8813; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.), CHK2-pT68, CHK2-pS516 (2661L, 2669S;
Cell signalling technology), GAPDH (Chemicon), HDMX
(A300-287A; Bethyl Laboratories), p53 (Ab-6; Oncogene
Science) p21, (#05-345; Upstate) and RAD50, MRE11, NBS1,
(#GTX70228, #GTX70212, #GTX70222; GeneTex Inc.).
Statistics
Statistical significance was determined using unpaired, 2tailed, t tests as appropriate, using GraphPad Prism 5 software.

Results
CCT241533 is a potent and selective CHK2 inhibitor
CCT241533 (Fig. 1A; ref. 28) was shown to be an ATP
competitive inhibitor of recombinant CHK2 in vitro
(Fig. 1B), with an IC50 of 3 nmol/L and Ki of 1.16 nmol/L
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Preincubation of CCT241533 with
CHK2 had no effect on enzyme kinetics, consistent with a
reversible mechanism of action (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The
corresponding CHK1 IC50 was 245 nmol/L, giving an 80-fold
selectivity. A screen of 85 kinases with 1 mmol/L CCT241533
identified 4 other kinases (PHK, MARK3, GCK, and MLK1,
highlighted in Supplementary Table S1) with greater than 80%
inhibition. Mouse plasma protein binding was 99% (data not
shown).
Crystal structure of CCT241533 bound to CHK2
The X-ray crystal structure of CCT241533 bound to the
kinase domain of human CHK2 was determined at a resolu
tion of 2.3 A. The inhibitor occupied the ATP-binding site and
was sandwiched between the hydrophobic side chains of
valine 234 and leucine 354 (Fig. 1C and D). The hydroxyl of
the phenol group was hydrogen bonded to the backbone
amide of methionine 304, providing the "hinge-binding" inter-

action seen in many kinase inhibitor structures, while also
being involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding back to
the quinazoline core. An additional hydrogen bond was made
between the side chain of glutamic acid 308 and the 4-amino
moiety of the quinazoline, as well as between the backbone
oxygen of glutamic acid 251 and the pendant pyrrolidine. The
methoxy substituents of the quinazoline core made no direct
interactions with the kinase, pointing away from the active
site and facing into the solvent.
Interestingly, the glycine-rich loop of the kinase was stabilized through predominantly hydrophobic packing interactions with the dimethylalcohol group of the inhibitor, giving a
readily interpretable electron density for the entire loop, with
the exception of cysteine 231, which seemed to be conformationally flexible.
Characterization of the DNA damage response pathway
in a panel of cell lines
The MRN complex, which is important for CHK2 activation,
has been shown to be defective in several human tumor cell
lines (33). To identify cell lines with active CHK2 pathways
suitable for further studies, we immunoblotted 14 human
tumor cell lines for the expression of components of the
CHK2 pathway and for biomarkers of CHK2 activation. For
this experiment, IR treatment was employed to induce DNA
DSBs and activate the ATM/CHK2 pathway (34, 35). Samples
were prepared 4 hours following IR treatment (5 Gy) and

immunoblotted for a range of proteins (Fig. 2A). IR activates
ATM, which phosphorylates CHK2 on threonine 68 (pT68),
and allows dimerization of the protein. The dimerized CHK2
then autophosphorylates in the trans position, on threonines
383 and 387, and in the cis position on serine 516 (pS516). This
fully phosphorylated and activated CHK2 gives rise to a
change in mobility, which can be visualized as a band shift
by SDS-PAGE. A CHK2 band shift was clearly observed in 10 of
the cell lines (HT-29, U-87 MG, A2780, OVCAR-3, OVCAR-5,
IGROV, A459, LNCaP, HeLa, and OVCAR-8), and they all
showed induction of pS516, consistent with CHK2 activation.
An increase in pS516 signal was seen in the CH1 cell line
without a clear band shift. An IR-induced decrease in HDMX,
which is targeted for destruction following phosphorylation by
CHK2, was seen in 5 of the cell lines (HCT-116, A459, LNCaP,
HeLa, and MCF7). The expression of the MRN components
varied between the different cell lines, with HCT-116 having
the lowest levels, and this correlated with defective CHK2
activation, as previously published (33). The p53 functional
status of the cell lines was assessed by monitoring IR-induced
stabilization of p53 protein and subsequent p53-induced
transactivation of p21 and agreed with published data (36).
The HT-29 and HeLa cell lines were selected for subsequent
studies as they showed functional activation of CHK2 in
response to IR by CHK2 band shift and induction of pS516
signal, and were functionally defective for p53.

was 1.7, 2.2, and 5.1 mmol/L, respectively. Treatment of HT-29
cells with 50 mmol/L etoposide for 5 hours induced phosphorylation of both T68 and S516 on CHK2 and a band shift in the
protein (Fig. 2B). Although CCT241533 blocked etoposideinduced autophosphorylation of CHK2 on S516 at concentrations as low as 0.5 mmol/L, considerably below the GI50,
inhibition of the CHK2 band shift was only seen at 5 mmol/
L or more and there was no loss of the ATM-dependent T68
phosphorylation in this cell line. Inhibition of the autophosphorylation of S516 in HeLa cells occurred at 0.5 mmol/L or
more, with inhibition of the band shift at 20 mmol/L or more
(Fig. 2B). Moreover, there was clear evidence that T68 phosphorylation was induced or retained following CHK2 inhibition (Fig. 2B). There was minimal inhibition of CHK1
autophosphorylation at S296 by CCT241533 (Fig. 2B). Cellular
inhibition data are summarized in Table 1. CHK2 phosphorylates HDMX in response to DNA damage, which targets this
protein for degradation as previously shown in MCF7 cells (37,
38). Supplementary Figure S2 shows that in this cell line,
etoposide treatment caused a clear decrease in HDMX levels
and this degradation was inhibited by CCT241533 at 0.25
mmol/L or more, and fully inhibited at 1 mmol/L or more.
We have therefore established that CCT241533 could inhibit
etoposide-induced biomarkers of CHK2 activity in 3 human
tumor cell lines at doses below its cellular GI50.

the action of genotoxic anticancer agents in a functionally
defective p53 tumor compared with normal tissue (3, 9). A

series of experiments was carried out in HT-29 colon cancer
cells (p53 defective) to investigate CHK2 activation in
response to different DNA-damaging agents including, bleomycin, IR, etoposide, SN38, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FdU),
doxorubicin, and mitomycin C (MMC). Figure 3A and B shows
a time course of CHK2 activation in response to 600 IU/mL
bleomycin (GI50 ¼ 30 IU/mL), a radiomimetic drug, and a dose
response to bleomycin, respectively. A band shift and marked
pS516 signal were seen after 4 hours of treatment with 600 IU/
mL bleomycin (Fig. 3A) and a marked induction of pS516
occurred after 6 hours at 150 IU/mL or more bleomycin.
Similar results were obtained with IR, and other DNA damaging agents (Supplementary Fig. S3). Consequently, bleomycin
was selected for further studies, as it was a potent activator of
CHK2 at therapeutically relevant concentrations.
To better understand the role of CHK2 in checkpoint
control, a series of cell-cycle experiments was carried out
with CCT241533 and bleomycin in cancer cells expressing
functional or defective p53. Figure 3C shows that the human

www.aacrjournals.org

lung adenocarcinoma line A549 (p53þ/þ) exhibited a G1/S and
G2/M arrest 24 hours following 60 IU/mL bleomycin treatment
consistent with wild-type p53 status. Treatment of these cells
with CCT241533 alone had minimal effects on the cell-cycle
distribution and bleomycin-induced cell-cycle arrest. In contrast, bleomycin induced a G2/M cell-cycle arrest in HeLa (p53
defective) cells with minimal G1/S arrest, consistent with p53null status (Fig. 3D). Once again there were no detectable
effects of CCT241533 alone or in combination with bleomycin.
Similar results were obtained at lower concentrations of
CCT241533 and later time points (48, 72, and 96 hours) and
in HT-29 (p53 defective) and MCF7 (p53 wild-type) cells (data
not shown).

there was no significant potentiation of cell death in the
presence of CCT241533 in either cell line (Table 1). Similarly,
colony-forming assays with HeLa cells confirmed the lack of
significant effects of CCT241533 on bleomycin cytotoxicity.
This lack of potentiation also seemed to be schedule independent in both HT-29 and HeLa cells (Supplementary
Table S2). Similar results were obtained with SN38, gemcitabine, etoposide, and MMC (Table 1 and Supplementary
Table S2), confirming the lack of potentiation of several
different genotoxic agents with CCT241533, despite the clear
biomarker evidence of CHK2 target inhibition.
CCT241533 potentiates the action of PARP inhibitors
Previously, it has been shown that depletion of CHK2 by
siRNA increased the sensitivity of HeLa cells to PARP inhibition (20). Our initial studies employed AG14447, a PARP
inhibitor currently in clinical trials (29). Both HeLa and
HT-29 cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to AG14447 in
the presence of CCT241533 (Fig. 4A and B, Table 1). The
original studies used a PARP inhibitor from a structurally

468

Cancer Res; 71(2) January 15, 2011

distinct chemical series of which the clinical candidate is
olaparib (20, 39, 40). Significant potentiation between
CCT241533 and olaparib was seen in HeLa cells (Fig. 4C,
Table 1). This relationship was also confirmed in a long-term
colony-forming assay in both cell lines (Fig. 4D, Table 1). Once
again, neither a 24-hour pretreatment or 24-hour delay in
CCT241533 exposure enhanced potentiation above that seen
with simultaneous addition of both drugs (Supplementary
Table S2). Although it is not possible to exclude "off-target"
effects, the observation of potentiation at concentrations of
CCT241533 that were nontoxic (Supplementary Fig. S4A) or
markedly below the GI50 (Table 1) suggest this is not a major
mechanism.
To investigate the activation and inhibition of CHK2 during
the course of the short-term growth delay assays, we treated

relevant concentration and this activation was blocked by
CCT241533. Furthermore, this combination of olaparib and
CCT241533 was shown to enhance apoptosis (Annexin V) in
HeLa cells at both 72 and 96 hours posttreatment (Fig. 5B and
Supplementary Fig. S4). These results are consistent with
CCT241533, potentiating PARP inhibitor cytotoxicity through
the inhibition of CHK2.

Discussion
We report the first characterization of CCT241533, a novel,
potent, and selective ATP competitive inhibitor of CHK2
(Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary
Table S1). Crystallographic structural studies showed that
CCT241533 binds to the ATP pocket of CHK2. At present,
there are 3 other reported selective CHK2 inhibitors, the 2arylbenzimidazoles (41), VRX0466617 (24), and PV1019 (21),

which were all substantially less potent than CCT241533
against CHK2 in vitro.
Many cancer cell lines have compromised DNA repair, and
several colon tumor cell lines have been reported to lack an
active MRN complex or be defective for CHK2 activation (33).
Of note is the HCT-116 cell line, which our studies confirm has
minimal MRN complex expression, and has been used in
several previous CHK2 studies (22, 24, 42, 43). To overcome
this problem, we tested a panel of human cancer cell lines for
MRN complex components and IR-induced CHK2 activation.
We found a fully functional CHK2 pathway in 10 of the 14
tested cell lines, with no evidence for MRN defects in 4 of 5
ovarian cell lines. In addition, there was minimal influence of
p53 status on CHK2 pathway activity, with half of the 10
functional lines exhibiting wild-type p53. The 2 cancer cell
lines picked for further detailed study each expressed all
members of the MRN complex and could fully activate

CHK2, as evidenced by a clear band shift following genotoxic
stress.
In response to DNA damage, ATM kinase phosphorylates
CHK2 on residue T68. This allows CHK2 to dimerize and
autophosphorylate in the trans position (T383 and T387) and
in the cis position (S516; Fig. 5C). Phosphorylated T68 is
therefore a biomarker of the upstream ATM pathway and
pS516 a marker of fully activated CHK2 kinase. The hyperphosphorylation of CHK2 also results in its mobility shift on SDSPAGE. We used these 3 biomarkers (pT68, pS516, and CHK2
band shift) to investigate the mechanism of action of
CCT241533 on CHK2 in cells. When cells were treated with
bleomycin, IR, or etoposide, activation of CHK2 was clearly
seen, with a complete band shift and presence of both pT68
and pS516 signals. Interestingly, time course studies with
these genotoxic agents showed that phosphorylation occurred
rapidly on T68 of CHK2 reaching a peak after 1 to 2 hours
and decreasing thereafter, whereas S516 phosphorylation
appeared later and increased over the duration of the time

course (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3). In several cell
lines, the experiments with etoposide and CCT241533 (Fig. 2B
and Supplementary Fig. S2) showed an increase in pT68 signal,
as CHK2 kinase activity was inhibited. This is consistent with
other studies and suggests that T68 phosphorylation is not
required for continued CHK2 kinase activity after the initial
ATM-dependent activation step (4), but that it remains on
CHK2 when it is unable to become fully activated (i.e., in the
presence of CCT241533). Consequently, T68 phosphorylation
alone should not be considered an adequate marker of full
CHK2 activation. CCT241533 inhibited the autophosphorylation of S516 on CHK2 at relatively low concentrations (below
its single agent GI50), and at higher concentrations the phosphorylation-induced mobility shift was completely blocked,
consistent with inhibition of CHK2 activity in a cellular context
(Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition to autophosphorylation on S516, active CHK2 phosphorylates a range of
downstream targets, including HDMX that is subsequently
degraded, and CCT241533 clearly rescued etoposide-induced

HDMX degradation in MCF7 tumor cells. All these robust
biomarker changes confirmed that CCT241533 is an active
CHK2 inhibitor in cells and these biomarkers may prove useful
in the future development and potential clinical evaluation of
CHK2 inhibitors.
There is clear evidence that CHK2 inhibition can protect
p53 wild-type cells from genotoxic agent-induced apoptosis
(21, 24–27), however, the roles of CHK2 inhibition in p53
deficient cells is complex and unclear. Reduced CHK2 levels
have been reported to sensitize HEK293 and HCT-116 cells to
IR or camptothecin (17, 22) and the CHK2 inhibitor PV1019
was reported to potentiate the cytotoxicity of topotecan and
camptothecin in OVCAR-4 and OVCAR-5 cells (21). However,
silencing of CHK2 by RNAi showed no effect or, no additional
effect on cell growth over CHK1 siRNA alone, when combined
with gemcitabine, 5-fluoro-20 -deoxyuridine (FdUrd), fluoruracil, camptothecin, and doxorubicin in HeLa, SW620, Panc-1
cells (18, 19), and CHK2 siRNA alone did not potentiate the
effect of gemcitabine in p53-deficient pancreatic cell lines (23).
In this study, CCT241533 did not potentiate the cytotoxic
effects of bleomycin or a selection of other cytotoxic agents as
assessed by growth delay or colony-forming assays (Table 1),
using a variety of different schedules (Supplementary Table S2).
CCT241533 had minimal effects on p53-dependent and independent checkpoint control (Fig. 3C and D). Endogenous DNA
base lesions occur naturally through hydrolysis, reactive oxygen species, and alkylation, and if left unrepaired cause the
collapse of the replication fork, often leading to DSBs. PARP-1
and -2 ribosylate both themselves and histones in response to
DNA base damage (44). This signal recruits other components
of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which facilitates
DNA repair, thus preventing DSB formation (Fig. 5C). The
structurally distinct PARP inhibitors olaparib and AG14447
were both shown to activate CHK2, as shown by increased
pS516 signal and partial mobility shift, possibly as a result of
increased DSB formation following BER inhibition (Fig. 5C).
CCT241533 significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of these
PARP inhibitors in both 96-hour growth delay and long-term
colony-forming assays and this was associated with a corresponding loss of CHK2 activation and an increase in apoptosis
(Fig. 5A and B). These results strongly suggest that the cytotoxic effects of the combination of CCT241533 and olaparib are

due to inhibition of CHK2 and this may lead to inhibition of
BRCA1 phosphorylation and impairment of the HR pathway,
giving rise to unrepairable and lethal DNA DSBs (Fig. 5C).
It is interesting that CHK2 inhibition can potentiate the
cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors but not bleomycin despite
both treatments generating DNA DSBs. Bleomycin is an acute
DNA-damaging treatment that activates CHK2 within 1 hour
(Fig. 3A) whereas PARP inhibition causes DNA damage
through endogenous base lesions being converted into DSBs
during DNA replication, which will accumulate after each
division. Consequently, CHK2 activation in response to olaparib in HeLa cells was slower than with bleomycin, giving an
increase in pS516 signal only after 72 hours of treatment. It is
likely that these kinetic differences in the creation of damage
may result in differences in the signaling context that activates
CHK2 and that this in turn influences the pathways downstream of CHK2 and hence sensitivity to CHK2 inhibition.
In conclusion, we have shown that CCT241533 is a potent
and selective CHK2 inhibitor in vitro and in cancer cell lines
expressing fully functional CHK2. Moreover, we have shown
that CCT241533 can enhance the cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors in p53-deficient cell lines. Consequently, the combination of CHK2 inhibitors with PARP inhibitors could provide a
new therapeutic avenue for targeted cancer therapy.
