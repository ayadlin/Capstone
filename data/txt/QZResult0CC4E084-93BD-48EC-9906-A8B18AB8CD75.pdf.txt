Abstract
Temozolomide is used widely to treat malignant glioma, but
the overall response to this agent is generally poor. Resistance to
DNA-damaging drugs such as temozolomide has been related to
the induction of antiapoptotic proteins. Speciﬁcally, the transcription factor NF-kB has been suggested to participate in promoting the survival of cells exposed to chemotherapy. To identify
factors that modulate cytotoxicity in the setting of DNA damage,
we used an unbiased strategy to examine the NF-kB–dependent
expression proﬁle induced by temozolomide. By this route, we
deﬁned the decoy receptor DcR1 as a temozolomide response
gene induced by a mechanism relying upon p50/NF-kB1. A
conserved NF-kB–binding sequence (kB-site) was identiﬁed in

the proximal promoter and was demonstrated to be required for
DcR1 induction by temozolomide. Loss-of-function and gain-offunction studies reveal that the atypical IkB protein, Bcl3, is also
required for induction of DcR1 by temozolomide. Mechanistically, DcR1 attenuates temozolomide efﬁcacy by blunting activation of the Fas receptor pathway in p53þ/þ glioma cells.
Intracranial xenograft studies show that DcR1 depletion in glioma
cells enhances the efﬁcacy of temozolomide. Taken together, our
results show how DcR1 upregulation mediates temozolomide
resistance and provide a rationale for DcR1 targeting as a strategy
to sensitize gliomas to this widely used chemotherapy. Cancer Res;

Introduction

downstream factors that regulate induction of apoptosis are also
important in the overall response.
NF-kB is a pivotal factor in the cytotoxic response to DNA
damage (5). Although DNA double-strand breaks activate NF-kB
by a well-elucidated nuclear to the cytoplasmic pathway (6),
temozolomide and other replication stress-inducing agents modulate NF-kB signaling in a more complex, promoter-speciﬁc
manner (7–9). The NF-kB family of proteins is comprised of ﬁve
subunits: p50 (NF-kB1, p105), p52 (NF-kB2, p100), p65 (relA),
relB, and crel that appear in their mature form as dimers (10). In
general, NF-kB dimers are retained in the cytoplasm through
interaction with the inhibitor-kB (IkB) proteins and, following
translocation to the nucleus, mediate their effect by binding to
speciﬁc consensus elements (kB-sites) in the promoter regions of
genes. Although all NF-kB subunits contain a conserved N-terminal rel homology domain, only p65, relB and crel have a Cterminal transactivation domain (TAD). p50 is a ubiquitously
expressed NF-kB subunit that is targeted by the temozolomideinduced DNA damage response (8). Despite the lack of a TAD,
p50 can induce NF-kB–dependent gene expression by associating
with other rel subunits or coregulator proteins. Bcl3 is one such
NF-kB coregulator that was originally identiﬁed at the t(14;19)
chromosomal translocation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
patients (11, 12). Bcl3 was subsequently found to be an atypical
IkB protein that modulates NF-kB transcriptional activity in
conjunction with p50- or p52-containing dimers (13). In this
capacity, Bcl3 has been reported to induce the expression of
antiapoptotic factors such as Bcl2 or Hdm2 (14, 15).
Apoptosis in response to temozolomide is reported to involve
both the intrinsic, or mitochondrial, pathway and the extrinsic, or

Over the past decade, the oral alkylating agent temozolomide
has become the standard chemotherapeutic for the management
of malignant glioma. Speciﬁcally, the addition of temozolomide
to ionizing radiation improves overall patient survival by approximately 2 months (1). Despite the clinical success of temozolomide, it is clear that many patients respond poorly to this agent at
least in part due to the intrinsic resistance of tumor cells to
damage-induced cell death. Temozolomide causes cytotoxicity
by forming O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG) adducts that mismatch
with deoxythymidine residues and induce apoptosis following
processing by the mismatch repair system (2). Although the repair
protein O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
plays a prominent role in resistance to temozolomide (3, 4),

receptor-induced, response (16, 17). The extrinsic pathway is
initiated by receptor–ligand binding, resulting in caspase-mediated cell death (18). TNF receptor superfamily members such as
Fas receptor (Fas, CD95, and Apo-1) and TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand-receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1, DR4) or TRAIL-R2 (DR5)
mediate killing via the extrinsic response. In addition to these
death receptors, two decoy receptors, DcR1 (TRAIL-R3, TRID, and
TNFRSF10C) and DcR2 (TRAIL-R4 and TRUNDD), have been
described previously. Decoy receptors do not induce cell death as
they lack critical components that are necessary for apoptosis
signaling (19). DcR1, a model decoy receptor, is found preferentially in untransformed cells (20) and attenuates apoptosis by
competing with DR4 and DR5 or by forming an inactive heteromer with other death receptors (21). DcR1, like other TRAIL
receptors, is a p53 target gene with an intronic p53-binding site
(BS) that is induced by DNA damaging agents (22).
In this study, using an unbiased genome-wide expression
analysis, we identify DcR1 as a factor signiﬁcantly induced by
temozolomide in a p50-dependent fashion. Mechanistic studies
demonstrate that DcR1 is coregulated by p50 and Bcl3 via a novel
kB-site, and in vitro and animal studies demonstrate that depletion
of DcR1 sensitizes gliomas to cytotoxicity by temozolomide.
Together, these ﬁndings support the observation that temozolomide induces apoptosis via the death receptor pathway and
suggest that targeting DcR1 is a strategy that can potentially
enhance the antiglioma effect of temozolomide clinically.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, reagents, and plasmids
Human U87, A172, T98, and U251 glioblastoma cells were
purchased from the ATCC and authenticated by routine morphologic and growth analysis and also by Western blotting. Cells were
cultured as previously described (8). U87 glioma cells expressing
sh-p105 or sh-control were also previously described (8). pCMVp50 was previously described (8), and used for experiments in Fig.
4. HA-p50 was cloned from the template, p50 cFlag pcDNA3
(Addgene plasmid 20018), obtained from Dr. Stephen Smale
(Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular
Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles CA),
following excision of the Flag and insertion of an HA tag. The Bcl3
expression construct, Bcl3-pFlag-CMV2, was a kind gift from Dr.
Albert Baldwin (Department of Biology, University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC).
RNA interference and stable transfectants
The following siRNA constructs were obtained from Dharmacon: siGENOME Human Bcl3, si-p53 (M-3329-03), si-DcR1 (sc40235), and si-scrambled control (D-001210-03-05). Also, sip50 (sense: GUCACUCUAACGUAUGCAAUU) and si-control
(sense: CCUACGCCACCAAUUUCGUUU) were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All siRNA constructs were transfected
using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen).
To make cells stably expressing sh-DcR1, PAGE-puriﬁed oligos
(sense: GATCCGCTGAAGAGACAATGAACATTCAAGAGATGTTCATTGTCTCTTCAGCTTTTTTACGCGTG and antisense: ATTCACGCGTAAAAAAGCTGAAGAGACAATGAACATCTCTTGAATGTTCATTGTCTCTTCAGCG) or scrambled control, were obtained from
IDT and annealed. Oligos were ligated into the BamHI and EcoRI
sites of the retrovirus: pSIREN-RetroQ-DsRed (Clontech). For
retroviral production, sh-control and sh-DcR1 vectors were
cotransfected with pCMV-VSV-G into Plat-GP cells using Xtreme

gene according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche). After 48
hours, the supernatant was cleared using a 0.45-mm syringe and
concentrated using Clontech Retro-X at 3.5 mL per 1 mL of viral
supernatant. The virus was collected by centrifugation at 1,500
 g for 45 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in regular
media with 20 mL polybrene and added to U87 cells. Cells were
split after 48 hours and maintained in regular media. Eighty
percent to 90% infection efﬁciency was determined by expression of Ds-Red, and knockdown of DcR1 veriﬁed by mRNA and
protein analysis.
Immunoblot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Immunoblotting was performed using whole-cell lysate as previously described (23). Primary antibodies used include: anti-Bcl3
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc185), anti-p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc397), anti-p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc7178), antiGAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-137179), anti-p53 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology; sc71818), anti-DcR1 (R&D Systems; 398600),
and anti-HA (Covance; MMS-101R). Alexa-Fluor 680 and AlexaFluor 800 ﬂuorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used for visualization with Odyssey Infrared system
(LICOR Biosciences). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
was performed as previously described (8) with competition using
cold speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc probes and supershift with anti-p50.
The kB probe sequence is shown in Fig. 4.
Quantitative real-time PCR and quantitative chromatin
immunoprecipitation
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed following
total mRNA isolation as described previously (8). DCR1 was
normalized to GAPDH, and relative DCR1 mRNA expression is
shown as the average of three experiments performed in triplicate.
Primers used for DCR1 are: sense, CACCAACGCTTCCAACAATGAACC and antisense, TCCGGAAGGTGCCTTCTTTACACT.
Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) was also
performed as described previously (8) following immunoprecipitation with anti-p50 or anti-Bcl3 antibodies. Control immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-Histone H1 and antimouse IgG. qPCR was performed using promoter-speciﬁc primers
for human DcR1 that span the region encompassing the putative
kB-site (sense, CCTCGACCATGCAAAGGGT and antisense, ACAGAATGAAGGACACAGGGG), and the change in DNA enrichment
for each immunoprecipitated condition determined relative to
input DNA. To control for nonspeciﬁc binding, the anti-p50 or
anti-Bcl3 data were subtracted from the anti-H1 results (anti-IgG
showed no binding) as previously described (8). The PCR product
was also run on a gel for a semiquantitative analysis of the data.
Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis and DcR1 expression
Analysis of apoptosis was performed as described previously (24)
at 72 or 96 hours following treatment. For DcR1 surface expression,
cells were treated with temozolomide and trypsinized, washed with
blocking buffer (PBS þ 1% BSA), and centrifuged at 1,500 RPM. The
cell pellet was divided into two groups and incubated with antiDcR1 (Abcam), or anti-IgG control. Pellets were incubated with
Alexa-ﬂuor–conjugated secondary antibody and analyzed on an
LSRII Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). Samples were run in
triplicate and data analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar Inc.).
Luciferase reporter and luciferase assay
For construction of a DcR1 luciferase reporter, we ampliﬁed a
segment of DNA containing the DCR1 proximal promoter and

tag was added to the C-terminus for immunoblot detection. This
cDNA was then inserted into the pLVX-Puro vector (Clontech)
and lentivirus generated using the packaging system from
Addgene (pMD2.G and psPAX). U87 cells were then infected
with HA-DcR1 lentivirus and selected with puromycin for 5 days.
Clonogenic and Trypan blue assays
Assays were performed essentially as described previously
(8, 24). FAS-neutralizing antibody (FNAb) was obtained from
Millipore (#05-338). For clonogenic assay with FNAb, U87 cells
were transfected with DCR1, or control, siRNA and after 48 hours
replated. Cells were then treated with 25 mmol/L temozolomide
and 1 mg/mL FNAb (or vehicle). FNAb was readministered once
16 hours later and colony number counted at 2 weeks. Data show

Nanoparticle production and characterization
Nanoparticles (NP) were manufactured and characterized as
previously described (25) by LNK Chemsolutions LLC. SiRNA
constructs were incorporated into nanoparticles in a similar
fashion to incorporation of other agents (25), and the product
maintained in sterile conditions.
Animal studies
Six- to 7-week-old male nude mice (Harlan) were used in
accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Chicago. For intracranial
studies, 5  105 U87 cells were injected into the right striatum as
previously described (24), and the animals randomized into
6 groups (n ¼ 6 per group). Either PBS or nanoparticles (10 mL)
carrying si-Control or si-DcR1 were injected intracranially on days
4 and 7 following tumor inoculation. Mice were also treated with
i.p. injection of vehicle or temozolomide on days 4 (5 mg/kg), 7
(5 mg/kg), and 10 (2.5 mg/kg; total temozolomide dose: 12.5 mg/
kg). Animals were followed until terminal, sacriﬁced and brains
harvested for veriﬁcation of tumor.
For hindlimb studies, 7.5  106 U87 cells were injected into the
right hind limb and animals randomized into 6 groups (n ¼ 5/
group) when tumors reached an average of 120 mm3 (day 0). Mice
were treated with daily i.t. injection of 50 mL nanoparticles
containing either si-control or si-DcR1 for 5 consecutive days,
and/or i.p. temozolomide (total dose: 12.5 mg/kg). Control
animals were injected i.t. or i.p. with vehicle. Tumor volume was
measured and documented every 2–3 days.
Statistical analyses
Results are expressed as mean  SD and signiﬁcance determined as a P value of <0.05 using a two-tailed Student t test.

Results
Temozolomide induces DcR1 protein expression
To identify NF-kB–dependent factors that modulate the
response to temozolomide, we performed an unbiased
genome-wide expression analysis in isogenic glioma cells following treatment with temozolomide. U87 cells stably expressing shp105 or sh-control, described previously (8), were treated with
temozolomide or vehicle and mRNA expression analyzed using
the affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The expression data will be described in detail in a separate publication (D.
Voce; unpublished data). DCR1 (TNFRSF10C) was identiﬁed as
one of a small set of genes signiﬁcantly induced only in p50proﬁcient cells following treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Given the importance of DcR1 in attenuating death receptorinduced apoptosis, we examined this decoy receptor in the
response to temozolomide. DcR1 is induced within 24 hours in
U87 cells (Fig. 1A), and the induction occurs in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 1B). As DcR1 is a cell surface receptor, the
change in DcR1 expression was quantiﬁed using ﬂow cytometry
and, consistent with the immunoblot analysis, DcR1 surface
expression is induced by temozolomide (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). In addition, temozolomide induces expression of DCR1

mRNA (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that temozolomide upregulates DcR1 in glioma cells.
DcR1 is induced in a p50- and p53-codependent manner
To verify the p50 dependence of DcR1, U87 cells expressing shp105 or sh-control were used. Consistent with the array ﬁndings,
loss of p105/p50 blocks induction of DcR1 at the mRNA (Fig. 2A)
and protein level (Fig. 2B). Moreover, knockdown of p105 also
attenuates DcR1 surface expression (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Importantly, reexpression of p50 in sh-p105 cells enables DcR1
induction, conﬁrming that it is p50, and not p105, that is
necessary for temozolomide-induced expression of DcR1 (Fig.
2C). Of note, reexpression of p50 is possible because the sh-p105
targets the C-terminus of p105 (8). DcR1 is also a p53 target gene
(22), and temozolomide increases expression of p53, and its
downstream target p21, with a time course consistent with activation of DcR1 (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Knockdown of p53
blocks the ability of temozolomide to induce DCR1 mRNA in U87
cells (Fig. 2D). In addition, consistent with p53 dependence,
temozolomide does not induce DcR1 in either T98 or U251
glioma cells, both of which are p53 mutant, even at a concentration of 250 mmol/L (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that DcR1 is

DcR1 contains a conserved kB-site that binds p50
As our data indicate that DcR1 is transcriptionally regulated by
NF-kB, we therefore searched the promoter and ﬁrst intron of
DCR1 (NCBI Gene ID: 8794) for potential NF-kB consensus
elements. Using the program, TFSEARCH (26), a 10-nucleotide
sequence sharing 86% homology with the canonical kB-site was
identiﬁed in the DCR1 proximal promoter (Fig. 3A). DCR1 has
only been described in primates (NCBI search TNFRSF10C), and
an identical nucleotide sequence is found in other primate species
(Fig. 3B). Gel shift assay (EMSA) shows that the putative kB-site
binds NF-kB in vitro and supershift analysis demonstrates that p50
is present within the NF-kB band (Fig. 3C). Also, temozolomide
does not alter the binding of NF-kB to the kB-site (Fig. 3C). To
examine whether p50 binds the DCR1 promoter in vivo, ChIP
assay was performed. p50 is recruited to the region of the DCR1
promoter containing the kB-site, and consistent with the EMSA,
temozolomide does not signiﬁcantly change this (Fig. 3D). A blot
of the PCR product further veriﬁes the enrichment of p50 in this
region (Supplementary Fig. S2A, right).
To examine the functional signiﬁcance of this consensus site,
we constructed a luciferase reporter bearing a 1.232 kbp region
encompassing the proximal promoter, exon 1 and a segment of
the ﬁrst intron of DCR1 (Fig. 4A). Given information from
previous DcR1 promoter/reporters (22, 27), our reporter was
constructed to contain the p53 BS shown to be important for
DcR1 induction. Temozolomide induces expression from this
reporter that peaks at 12 hours (Fig. 4B). Mutation of the p53
BS or kB-site blocks basal and induced reporter activity (Fig. 4C)
demonstrating that the putative kB-site is necessary for activity of
the reporter. We next examined whether this site is regulated by
p50. Knockdown of p105/p50 blocks induction of activity from

the wild-type (wt) reporter in response to temozolomide
(Fig. 4D). Moreover, when p50 is reexpressed in sh-p105 cells,
a substantial increase in basal activity is seen that is further
increased by temozolomide (Fig. 4D, right). These results suggest
that a kB-site in the DCR1 promoter binds p50 and is required for
p50-mediated induction by temozolomide.
Induction of DcR1 by temozolomide requires Bcl3
Despite the p50/p53 codependence of DcR1, in A172 cells that
are p53-wt (28) and have abundant p50, temozolomide only
slightly induces expression of DcR1 (Fig. 5A). To further study this
observation, we looked at the cytogenetics of A172 cells and noted
that these cells have a signiﬁcant deletion near chromosome
19q13.2 (29), a region containing the locus of the NF-kB coregulator, BCL3. As Bcl3 plays a prominent role in p50-dependent
gene activation (30), we investigated whether DcR1 requires Bcl3
for induction by temozolomide. First, it is evident that, although
A172 cells do express Bcl3, they have substantially less than some
other glioma cell lines (Fig. 5B). Also, in U87 cells ChIP assay
conﬁrms that Bcl3 is bound to the DCR1 promoter and its
recruitment minimally altered by treatment (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). Knockdown of Bcl3 completely blocks the ability of temozolomide to induce DCR1 mRNA (Fig. 5C) and protein expression
(Fig. 5D). Moreover, depletion of Bcl3 blocks the ability of
temozolomide to induce activation of the DCR1 promoter/intron
1 reporter (Fig. 5E). To conﬁrm the role of Bcl3, we obtained a Bcl3
cDNA construct (gift from Dr. Albert Baldwin). Overexpression of
Bcl3 in A172 cells enables temozolomide to induce DcR1 expression (Fig. 5F), an observation also noted in U87 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Together, these data indicate that temozolomide requires Bcl3 to induce DcR1 expression.
Induction of DcR1 blocks the cytotoxic effect of temozolomide
DcR1 attenuates apoptosis (21), suggesting that its induction
by temozolomide acts to block killing. Depletion of DcR1 leads to

a signiﬁcant increase in apoptosis following temozolomide treatment as assessed by annexin V binding (P < 0.05, Fig. 6A). As a
speciﬁcity control, we also constructed U87 cell lines expressing
shRNAs targeting DcR1 or a scrambled sequence. Three DcR1
shRNA constructs were used and cell lines screened for knockdown of DcR1 using qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Cells
expressing sh-DcR1-3 were selected and depletion of DcR1 protein conﬁrmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6B, inset). Sh-RNA
depletion of DcR1 augments induction of apoptosis by temozolomide (Fig. 6B) supporting the siRNA data and conﬁrming that
the effect is not due to the speciﬁc siRNA used. In addition, as
temozolomide induces cytotoxicity at late times following treatment, we examined cell viability over time using Trypan blue dye
exclusion. Temozolomide increases the percentage of nonviable
cells over time and knockdown of DcR1 augments this effect
beginning 72 hours after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2D). As
DcR1 is not induced by temozolomide in U251 cells, we also
examined cytotoxicity in these cells. Knockdown of DcR1 does not
affect induction of apoptosis by temozolomide in U251 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3A).
We next examined clonal survival. Depletion of DcR1 augments
the decrease in survival induced by temozolomide in U87 cells
(Fig. 6C) and to a lesser extent in A172 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3B), likely due to the lower level of DcR1 induction in A172 cells
compared with U87 cells. By contrast, in U251 cells no signiﬁcant
change in clonal survival is seen in response to temozolomide
following DcR1 depletion compared with control (Supplementary Fig. S3C). To further study the importance of DcR1, we cloned
a cDNA of human HA-tagged DcR1 and constructed an HA-DcR1
lentiviral expression vector. U87 cells were infected with this
construct and stable expression of HA-DcR1 conﬁrmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6D). Overexpression of DcR1 signiﬁcantly
attenuates the decrease in clonal survival induced by temozolomide relative to vector control (Fig. 6D). Taken together, overexpression and downregulation studies indicate that DcR1 acts to
attenuate the anti-glioma effect of temozolomide.

Given that DcR1 speciﬁcally blocks death receptor-induced
cytotoxicity, we sought to examine whether DcR1 affects the
temozolomide-induced death receptor response. It was previously noted that induction of apoptosis by temozolomide is
attenuated by an FNAb that blocks death receptor signaling
(17). We used FNAb in temozolomide-treated U87 cells that
were initially transfected with siRNA targeting either DcR1 or a
control sequence. Although exposure to FNAb results in a 1.2fold increase in clonal survival in temozolomide-treated cells
expressing si-control, in cells depleted of DcR1 there is almost
a 4-fold increase in survival in the presence of FNAb (Fig. 6E).
The observation that blocking the death receptor response with
FNAb has a more profound effect in the presence of DcR1
knockdown, suggests that DcR1 inhibits apoptosis induced by
temozolomide speciﬁcally by affecting the death receptor
pathway. Importantly, we veriﬁed that in our hands FNAb
does attenuate the decrease in survival induced by Fas ligand
(FasL; Supplementary Fig. S4A). Moreover, although FNAb
does not directly bind DcR1, both FNAb and DcR1 modulate
apoptosis via the same receptor-mediated downstream signaling cascade (31). Consistent with DcR1 playing a role in the
Fas response, whereas knockdown of DcR1 augments the effect
of FasL (Supplementary Fig. S4B), overexpression of DcR1
completely blocks the effect of FasL (Supplementary Fig.
S4C). Of note, depletion of DcR1 has much less profound
effect than DcR1 overexpression likely because of the low basal
DcR1 level. In sum, these ﬁndings indicate that induction of
DcR1 blocks death receptor–mediated cytotoxicity in response
to temozolomide.
Knockdown of DcR1 enhances the effect of temozolomide in a
glioma model
We next sought to examine DcR1 depletion in an animal
glioma model. As there are no DcR1 inhibitors, blocking this
factor requires a genetic approach. Stable sh-DcR1 cells do not
form xenografts, therefore, we targeted DcR1 by encapsulating

and delivering siRNA using a biodegradable nanoparticle vector
previously described for the treatment of malignant glioma (25).
Nanoparticles were fabricated to encapsulate either DcR1 siRNA
(NP-si-DcR1) or control siRNA (NP-si-cntl). Exposure of U87 cells
to NP-si-DcR1 results in a decrease in DcR1 protein expression
relative to vehicle or NP-si-cntl (Fig. 7A). In addition, NP-si-DcR1
results in a signiﬁcant decrease in clonal survival in combination
with temozolomide relative to that with temozolomide and NPsi-cntl (Fig. 7B). To examine efﬁcacy in vivo, intracranial U87
glioma xenografts were established and nanoparticles administered by direct intracranial injection. A signiﬁcant increase in
animal survival is seen in mice treated with combination temozolomide and NP-si-DcR1 compared with either agent alone or to
the combination of temozolomide and NP-si-cntl (P < 0.01, logrank: temozolomide þ NP-si-DcR1 vs. temozolomide þ NP-sicntl; Fig. 7C). A similar ﬁnding is also seen when hindlimb
xenografts are treated with temozolomide and nanoparticles
(P < 0.01, temozolomide þ NP-si-DcR1 vs. NP-si-DcR1; Supplementary Fig. S4D). These ﬁndings indicate that in an established
growing intracranial xenograft, depletion of DcR1 combines
effectively with temozolomide to improve the anti-glioma effect.

Discussion
NF-kB plays a central role in regulating the cytotoxic response
to DNA damage. To identify potential factors that modulate the
cytotoxic effect of temozolomide, we examined the NF-kB–

www.aacrjournals.org

dependent expression proﬁle induced by this agent in glioma
cells. DCR1, a decoy receptor that attenuates death receptor–
induced apoptosis, was identiﬁed as an NF-kB/p50–dependent
gene signiﬁcantly induced by treatment. Given that death receptor
signaling is important for temozolomide-induced apoptosis (17),
we examined the role of DcR1 in the response to temozolomide.
Our ﬁndings demonstrate that DcR1 is induced by temozolomide
in a manner dependent not only on p50 and p53, but also on the
proto-oncogene, Bcl3. Moreover, we show that DcR1 attenuates
the cytotoxic effect of temozolomide. In support of the ability of
DcR1 to attenuate the anti-glioma response, examination of the
Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data database indicates
that patients with upregulated DCR1 expression do signiﬁcantly
worse than others (Supplementary Fig. S5; ref. 32).
Although it has previously been reported that DNA damage can
induce DcR1 and that this response attenuates sensitivity to TRAIL
(33), upregulation of DcR1 has not previously been reported to
directly block DNA damage–induced killing. In demonstrating
that inhibition of DcR1 augments killing by temozolomide, our
data support the hypothesis that temozolomide induces cytotoxicity, at least in part, via the death receptor pathway (17). This
hypothesis is further suggested by the ﬁnding that FNAb has a
greater inhibitory effect on the temozolomide-induced response
(i.e., causes a greater increase in survival) when DcR1 is depleted
than when DcR1 is present.
The NF-kB dependence of DcR1 is supported by identiﬁcation
of a conserved kB-site within the proximal promoter of the DCR1

gene. p50 binds this kB-site in vitro and is also recruited to the
promoter region containing this sequence in vivo. Moreover, this
consensus element is necessary for activation of a DcR1 promoter/
reporter by temozolomide. Together, these ﬁndings support a
functional role for the kB-site in regulating DcR1 expression in
response to temozolomide. It is notable that the putative DCR1
kB-site contains a conserved deoxythymidine (T) residue at the
1 position. Interestingly, we previously reported that phosphorylation of p50 by temozolomide results in inhibition of NF-kB
binding to kB-sites with a 1C or G, while binding to kB-sites
with a 1A or 1T is unaltered (9). Consistent with this observation, p50 binding to the DCR1 kB-site (50 -GGGATGCCCC-30 ) is
unchanged following temozolomide treatment. In addition, the
NF-kB dependence of DcR1 is also consistent with a previous
study that noted that this gene is induced by crel and blocked by
IkBa, respectively (34). Although a speciﬁc kB-site has not previously been reported for DCR1, functional consensus sequences
have been identiﬁed for both DR4 and DR5 (35, 36), death
receptors that are highly homologous to DCR1 (31).
DcR1 is induced in a p50-dependent manner; however, this NFkB subunit lacks a TAD and requires either a rel subunit or
additional factor to induce NF-kB–dependent gene expression.
The atypical IkB protein, Bcl3, is an important NF-kB coregulator
that contains two TADs and has been shown to induce NF-kB–

2046 Cancer Res; 75(10) May 15, 2015

dependent gene expression in conjunction with DNA bound p50
(30). We demonstrate that Bcl3 is necessary for efﬁcient DcR1
expression in response to temozolomide. In support of this
hypothesis, although loss of Bcl3 in U87 cells blocks the ability
of temozolomide to induce DcR1, Bcl3 overexpression has the
opposite effect, enhancing DcR1 induction. In addition, the
ﬁndings that Bcl3 binds the DCR1 promoter in vivo and that Bcl3
depletion blocks temozolomide-induced expression from the
DCR1 promoter/reporter support the hypothesis that this coregulator directly modulates the expression of DcR1. From a mechanistic perspective, given the minimal change in p50 and Bcl3
recruitment to the DCR1 promoter following treatment (Fig. 3D
and Supplementary Fig. S2A), it is likely that temozolomide
promotes DcR1 expression by inducing NF-kB posttranslational
modiﬁcations and/or by inducing recruitment of additional p50or Bcl3-dependent cofactors (37).
DcR1, like its counterpart DcR2, was initially identiﬁed as a
receptor preferentially expressed in normal tissues relative to
cancer cells (20, 38). However, it is evident that even in cancer
cells DcR1 expression is inducible and attenuates DNA damageinduced cytotoxicity. Similarly, DcR2 is also induced by chemotherapeutics in malignant cells (39). These observations raise
the possibility that targeting decoy receptors is a strategy that can
potentially enhance the therapeutic effect of DNA-damaging

agents. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that
depletion of DcR1 enhances the cytotoxic effect of temozolomide.
Moreover, by targeting DcR1 in an animal glioma model, we show
that blocking expression of this receptor enhances the overall antiglioma effect. Importantly, the in vivo effect of blocking DcR1 is
demonstrated against a growing intracranial tumor whose cells
were not previously manipulated to deplete DcR1, this ﬁnding
highlights the potential of DcR1 as a viable clinical chemosensitizing target.
Despite the efﬁcacy of RNAi for targeted depletion of proteins,
in vivo knockdown of genes is hampered by various factors that
include among other things, the protection of the siRNA and
efﬁcient delivery to the target tissue (40). To improve these
aspects, we encapsulated the DcR1 siRNA in a biocompatible
nanoparticle vector that directly delivers its payload to the cytoplasm (25). In addition, nanoparticles were injected directly into
the brain to concentrate delivery to the tumor cells. Although
siRNA-mediated DcR1 depletion is good for proof-of-principle
studies in an animal model, ultimately, delivery of a pharmacologic inhibitor may be a more effective strategy for clinical use.
Inhibition of cellular resistance pathways is an effective
strategy to enhance the therapeutic effect of cytotoxic agents.
Although blocking NF-kB can improve the antitumor effect of
certain chemotherapeutics (41), this transcription factor has a
variable role in cytotoxic signaling and is often required for cell
death (8, 42). Nevertheless, NF-kB promotes expression of
many antiapoptotic factors, suggesting that selective targeting
of downstream NF-kB–dependent genes is a strategy that can be
used to rationally enhance cytotoxicity. Although temozolomide induces cell death primarily via the intrinsic apoptotic
response in p53 mutant gliomas, in p53 wt tumors the exogenous pathway predominates (17). DcR1 represents an antiapoptotic factor robustly induced by temozolomide that
attenuates killing in p53-wt tumors. Given that virtually every
patient diagnosed with malignant glioma is treated with temo-

zolomide, targeting factors such as DcR1 can potentially make a
signiﬁcant impact on patient management speciﬁcally in
tumors that are wt for p53.
