ABSTRACT
Based on the nationwide survey into inpatients’ utilization of the health service
covered by China’s urban basic medical insurance from 2008 to 2010, we analyzed
the use rate, cancer profile and combined use of anticancer Chinese patent medicines
(CPMs) on 51,382 insured cancer patients by using statistical, bi-clustering and network
methods. We found that 42.4% of 51,382 cancer patients used 33 anticancer CPMs, and
51.7% used 71 anticancer Western medicines (WMs). The CPMs were most often used
in lung (52%) and nasopharynx (52%) cancer patients, and least in bladder cancer
(21%) and leukemia of unspecified cell type (21%) patients. The cost per patient
for all 33 anticancer CPMs was 2069RMB, lower than that of the WMs (3458RMB).
The cancer profile of commonly used CPMs and WMs for the top 17 cancers (>500
sampled patients) were provided, indicating anticancer CPMs had a broad spectrum of
cancers and lacked selectivity in cancer treatment (CPM mean CV = 49%; WM mean
CV = 152%). Moreover, 24.8% of the cancer patients used both CPMs and WMs, and
CPM-WM combined use networks were constructed for four major cancers. This first
nationwide analysis revealed the use characteristics and herb-drug combined use
patterns of insurance covered anticancer CPMs in China. The study offers valuable
information to guide future studies of the precision, safety and standard use of CPMs.

has showed bright prospects not only in the discovery of
anticancer drugs [6], but also in the systematic therapy for
complex diseases [7]. With the wide use and increasing
interest of CPMs in cancer treatment, a comprehensive and
in-depth analysis for anticancer CPMs is urgently required.
To meet such urgent needs, we analyzed the data from
the first nationwide survey into inpatients’ utilization of health
services covered by China’s Urban Basic Medical Insurance
from 2008 to 2010. This investigation was conducted by
the China Health Insurance Research Association affiliated
with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security
of China. The health insurance data can provide rich
information to describe the clinical care and drug use in a
large scale [8, 9]. Based on 51,382 insured cancer inpatients
from the nationwide survey, we for the first time revealed
the use characteristics as well as herb-drug combined use

INTRODUCTION
Chinese patent medicines (CPMs), as a new fashion
to modernize traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), play an
increasingly important role in China’s medical practice.
CPMs are produced by modern manufacturing processes
in forms such as capsules and injections [1]. CPMs,
together with Western medicines (WMs) and Chinese
herbal medicines, are the three categories of drugs in
China’s National Basic Medical Insurance Drug Catalogue
(NBMIDC) [2], since China launched the National Basic
Medical Insurance System in 1998. Anticancer CPMs is a
special category in NBMIDC anticancer drugs. Recently,
several hospitals reported that anticancer CPMs are
increasingly being used in cancer treatment, and even
growing faster than Western drugs [3–5]. Moreover, TCM

patterns in China, offering valuable information to improve
the rational use of anticancer drugs in the future.

Overall, 44,447 patients (87%) experienced 17
malignant cancers with each cancer having more than
500 cases (Table S2). 9 of the top 10 cancers are the
same as those from a previously China national survey
[10]. In top 17 cancers, use of 33 anticancer CPMs
was highest in lung and nasopharynx cancer patients
(both were 52%), and was higher than those using
anticancer WMs (44% and 45%). Anticancer CPMs
were also more commonly used than anticancer WMs
for liver cancer (20% more), kidney cancer (14% more),
pancreatic cancer (10% more), and esophagus cancer
(8% more). By contrast, anticancer CPMs were used
least for bladder cancer and leukemia of unspecified
cell type (both were 21%) (Fig. 1C and 1D).

RESULTS
Overall use of anticancer CPMs and WMs in
sampled cancer patients
Of the 51,382 hospitalized cancer patients
(Table S1), 67.9% (cost ratio 13.4%) used CPMs,
42.4% (cost ratio 9.1%; 2069 RMB cost per patient)
used anticancer CPMs; 98.2% (cost ratio 86.4%) used
WMs, and 51.7% (cost ratio 18.6%; 3458 RMB cost
per patient) used anticancer WMs (Fig. 1A and 1B).

Raw materials and efficacy of commonly used
anticancer CPMs

As shown in Fig. 1E–1J, the use rate (mean 1.9%)
of individual anticancer CPMs in 51,382 cancer patients
was significantly higher than that of individual anticancer
WMs (mean 1.6%) (P = 0.017). There was no significant
difference in the cost between individual anticancer
CPMs (mean, 1.37 million RMB per drug) and that of
individual anticancer WMs (mean, 1.29 million RMB per
drug) (P = 0.069). Moreover, in subtypes of the anticancer
CPMs, the use rate and cost of the CPMs injections or
CPMs with less than 10 raw materials were significantly
higher than those of oral formulations, or those with over
10 raw materials, respectively (all P < 0.05). The number
of raw materials contained in an anticancer CPM was
found to be significantly and negatively correlated with
its usage (correlation coefficient = −0.449, P = 0.009; see
data and diagram in Table S3).

By calculating the total use frequency of 33
anticancer CPMs with the same materials, the 10 mostly
used raw materials are Huang-Qi (Astragali Radix), RenShen (Ginseng Radix Et Rhizoma), Ku-Shen (Sophorae
Flavescentis Radix), Ban-Mao (Mylabris), Ci-Wu-Jia
(Acanthopanacis Senticosi Radix Et Rhizoma Seu Caulis),
Dang-Shen (Codonopsis Pilosula), Nv-Zhen-Zi (Ligustri
Lucidi Fructus), Tu-Fu-Ling (Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma),
Ban-Zhi-Lian (Scutellariae Barbatae Herba), and Ya-DanZi (Bruceae Fructus). The therapy effects of anticancer
CPMs are mainly expressed as two types of traditional
efficacy in their instructions. One is “eliminating pathogen”
(Qu-Xie in Chinese) labeled as clearing away hot, relieving
blood stasis, removing toxin, etc. for those Antitumor
CPMs. For instance, all top 3 antitumor CPMs have an
efficacy of clearing away hot. The other is “strengthening

Table 3 illustrates the mean and maximum use
rate of anticancer CPMs and WMs in top 17 cancers,
respectively. The coefficient of the variation (CV)
value, characterizing the extent of variability of the
use rate of anticancer CPMs, ranged from 24% to 93%,
with a mean of 49%. This result was significantly lower
than that of anticancer WMs, which ranged from 97%
to 255%, with a mean of 152%. The results once again

body resistance” (Fu-Zheng in Chinese) labeled as tonifying
Qi, nourishing yin, etc. for those Adjuvant antitumor CPMs.
Table 1 listed the individual efficacy of top 15 anticancer
CPMs with use frequency more than 500 patients.
We noticed that CPMs in two NBMIDC
subcategories have overlapping raw materials. For
example, in top 15 anticancer CPMs, five adjuvant
antitumor CPMs and two antitumor CPMs (Aidi Injection
and Fufangbanmao Capsule) has a herb material
Huang-Qi (Astragali Radix). Both an antitumor CPM
(Fufangkushen Injection) and an adjuvant antitumor CPM
(Kangai Injection) contain the herb Ku-Shen (Sophorae
Flavescentis Radix). These CPMs showed similar
applicable indications (Fig. 2). Moreover, five antitumor
CPMs including Aidi Injection and Fufangbanmao
Capsule contain toxic materials indicated in China’s
Pharmacopoeia or literature (Table 1), which may reflect
the TCM idea of “fighting poison with poison”.

Combined use networks of anticancer CPMs
and WMs
In this survey, a total of 12,743 (24.8%) patients
used both anticancer CPMs and WMs simultaneously
during their hospital stays. To obtain the combined use
patterns of both medicines, a CPM-WM combined use
network for four major cancers in China was constructed
(Fig. 4). Among the high frequent combinations,
adjuvant antitumor CPMs were more commonly used
in conjunction with WMs in treating lung cancer. The
gastrointestinal cancers, in particular stomach and
colorectal cancers, shared similar combination profiles,
in which CPMs tended to band together with the first line
WM regimens, such as FOLFOX4. Meanwhile, adjuvant
antitumor CPMs including Shenqifuzheng injection and
antitumor CPMs including Aidi injection were involved
in all four cancers together with WMs. Parts of these
CPM-WM combinations were supported by clinical
evidence as reported (Table S5).

Cancer profile of anticancer CPMs and WMs by
bi-clustering analysis
Anticancer CPMs tended to be used for a broad
spectrum of top 17 cancers (Fig. 3A). Few of these
(Huaier, Jinlong, Ganfule and Zilongjin) showed
selectivity but had a relatively low use rate (<6%) in the
specific cancers. The top two frequently used anticancer
CPMs (Shenqifuzheng injection and Fufangkushen
injection) were used for almost all 17 types of cancers.
By contrast, anticancer WMs were more specific in cancer
therapy (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, anticancer WMs for liver
and kidney cancers were used at a lower rate than those for
other cancers. Table S4 showed 22 anticancer WMs with
use frequency more than 500 patients.

DISCUSSION
This nationwide analysis characterizes how CPMs
are used to fight cancer in China. In general, anticancer
CPMs have gained increased popularity and been used in
almost half (42.4%) of investigated cancer patients. The
cost per patient for all anticancer CPMs is lower than that
of anticancer WMs. We found that CPMs with less raw
materials are relatively more popular in treating cancers
(Fig. 1; Table S3). This is partly due to CPM injections
that usually composed of less raw materials are used more
commonly than other CPMs. And the less raw materials
may make the CPMs easier to understand and more
acceptable for clinicians. Compared with 71 anticancer
WMs, the use rate of 33 anticancer CPMs was higher
than in liver, kidney, pancreatic, and esophagus cancers.
There are two probable reasons. Firstly, these four cancers
may have less specific and effective anticancer WMs than
other cancers, leading to a lower use rate of anticancer
WMs. Secondly, some first line drugs for the liver cancer
and kidney cancer such as Sorafenib and Sunitinib
were not covered by NBMIDC, making the use rate of
anticancer WMs much lower in liver cancer (29%) and

Individual anticancer medicines for top 17 cancers
Individually, anticancer CPMs do not dominate
the cancer therapy. The top use rate of individual
anticancer CPMs in 17 cancers except liver and kidney
cancers was much lower than that of anticancer WMs
(Table 2). The highest use rate of the CPMs in 17
cancers was Fufangkushen injection in nasopharynx
and pancreas cancers (12%), a value much lower
than that of individual anticancer WMs (45% for
Cytarabine in leukaemia unspecified). Furthermore, the
most commonly used WM for stomach cancer was a
regimen of Oxaliplatin/Fluorouracil/LV, whereas the
NCCN guideline (Version 1.2008) recommended 5-FU,
Capecitabine, ECF (Epirubicin/Cisplatin/Fluorouracil)
or DCF (Docetaxel/Cisplatin/Fluorouracil), based
on high-level evidence. The top two anticancer WMs
commonly used for bladder cancer (Pirarubicin and
Hydroxycamptothecin) in current data were absent in
NCCN guideline (Version 1.2008).

kidney cancer (17%). By contrast, the anticancer CPMs
are widely used in various cancers, and thus showing a
relatively higher rate in these four cancers especially in
liver and kidney cancers.
In this study, a “widespread and dispersive”
charateristic with low selectivity for the use of anticancer
CPMs has been revealed (Table 2, Table 3 and Fig. 3).
Although the mean usage of anticancer CPMs was
significantly higher than their western counterparts, the use
rates of top anticancer CPMs (no more than 12%) were
much lower than those of top WMs (a maximum of 45%) in
17 main cancers except kidney cancer (Table 2). The results
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggest the individual anticancer CPMs are not dominant
in a specific cancer treatment. One possible reason is that
CPMs always regulate overall health of human body rather
than simply fight against a specific cancer. A typical case
is Shenqifuzheng injection, the most often used adjuvant
antitumor CPM. This injection, broadly used for almost
all 17 cancers, is composed of Huang-Qi (Astragali
Radix) and Dang-Shen (Codonopsis Pilosula). Both of
the two herbs contain immunomodulatory ingredients,
and can improve the immune function of cancer patients
receiving chemotherapy [11–14]. Thus, Shenqifuzheng
injection could be widely used as an efficacious adjuvant

Radix (B) that in both “antitumor” and “adjuvant antitumor” subcategories of CPM.
to prevent immunity impairment that usually occurs in
therapy of various cancers. Another reason for the low
selectivity of CPMs is that the precise efficacy of CPMs
is not quite clear in clinical use. Anticancer CPMs mainly
labeled their traditional efficacy (Table 1). However, the
applicable cancer type was not clearly stated in instructions
or just indicated as “et al.” or “advanced cancers” for many
CPMs. Thus, the specific and evidence-based indications
are still required to improve the rational use of CPMs.
This study also indicates the subcategory classification
of CPMs in NBMIDC needs to be further clarified, since
both CPM subcategories have similar clinical use patterns
and overlapped herb materials such as Astragali Radix
(an immunomodulatory herb [11,12]) and Sophorae
Flavescentis Radix (an anti-tumor herb [15,16]) (Fig. 2).
Special safety caution should also be paid to CPM
injections and CPMs containing toxic ingredients.
The CPMs and WMs are commonly used in
combination and work in concert for cancer treatment.
Most of the herb-drug pairs identified by our network
analysis (Fig. 4) have clinical evidence (Table S5), often
reported as improving quality of life of patients and
reducing adverse reactions of chemotherapy. Thus, CPMs
may offer potential therapeutic benefits for cancer patients
by boosting efficiency and decreasing toxicity caused by
WMs. Other herb-drug pairs lacking of references deserve
further investigation. More solid evidence and whether
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

new safety risks can be generated from the herb-drug
interactions needs further studies. A standard program
will be of great significance to guide the combined use of
CPMs and WMs.
Although our data only catch sampled patients
in China and the results need to be validated in larger
samples, this analysis for the first time addressed the
clinical use of anticancer CPMs in a China nationwide.
This study provides valuable information to improve the
standardization, rationalization and internationalization of
the clinical use of Chinese medicines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
National-wide sampling
Data was from a nationwide survey for inpatients’
utilization of health services covered by China’s urban basic
medical insurance from 2008 to 2010. All patients were
firstly sorted by discharge time and then randomly sampled
from China’s 29 provincial-level administrative regions.
The inpatients came from 2,576 hospitals in 22 provinces,
3 autonomous regions, and 4 centrally-administered
municipalities. The percentage of the sampled inpatients
who had medical insurance coverage was 2% in the centrallyadministered municipalities and provincial capitals, 5% in the
prefecture-level cities, and 10% in the counties.

include 56 cytotoxic, 9 hormone, 4 auxiliary and 2 other drugs.

the statistical significance of the use rate and cost between
the anticancer CPMs and anticancer WMs, as well as a
comparison analysis for different types of anticancer CPMs.
A Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to analyze
the correlation between the rank of use rates and the rank of
number of raw materials contained in each anticancer CPMs.
Bi-clustering method was used to analyze the cancer
profile of anticancer CPMs and WMs. A bipartite graph
was first created for drugs and various types of cancers, in
which nodes denoted drugs or cancers, and edges denoted
the use of a drug for a particular cancer. The weights

Statistical, bi-clustering, and network analysis
Use-frequency of a drug (CPM or WM) refers to the
total number of patients in which a drug was used in the
medication records. Use rate of a drug was the percentage
of the total cancer patients or patients with a specific cancer
who used the drug. Cost ratio means Ratio of the total drug
cost. A Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to evaluate

of edges were expressed as the use rate of drug, which
represented the percentage of patients with a certain
cancer who used drug. Then, hierarchical clustering was
performed for drugs using all of the row vectors to cluster
together similar drugs. Similarly, hierarchical clustering
was performed for the various types of cancers to cluster
together similar cancers. The order of drugs and cancers
was adjusted according to the results of the clustering and
a heat map was generated.
A network approach was used to analyze the
combined use of CPMs and WMs [17]. The network
nodes represented drugs, and the edges represented the
combined relationship between two drugs. The combined
relationship was measured by two indicators. One was
the frequency of the combined use, which referred to the
number of cancer patients who used drugs in combination.
The other was the mutual information entropy [17]. The
effective combined relationships were screened (total
number of combined use >50 times, or total combined
mutual information >0.005) for constructing CPM-WM
combined use networks (see Supplementary text).
