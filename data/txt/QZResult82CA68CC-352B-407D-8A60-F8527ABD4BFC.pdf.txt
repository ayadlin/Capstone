Abstract
Recently, several laboratories have started to investigate the
involvement of glutamate signaling in cancer. In previous
studies, we reported on a transgenic mouse model that
develops melanoma spontaneously. Subsequent studies in
these mice identified that the aberrant expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1) in melanocytes played a
critical role in the onset of melanoma. Confirmation of the
etiologic role of GRM1 in melanoma development was shown
in a second transgenic line with GRM1 expression under the
regulation of a melanocyte-specific dopachrome tautomerase
promoter. Ectopic expression of GRM1 was also detected in a
subset of human melanoma cell lines and biopsies, suggesting
that aberrant expression of GRM1 in melanocytes may
contribute to the development of human melanoma. GRM1,
a seven-transmembrane domain G protein–coupled receptor,
is normally expressed and functional in neuronal cells, and its
ligand, glutamate, is the major excitatory neurotransmitter.
Human melanoma cells are shown here to release elevated
levels of glutamate, implying a possible autocrine loop.
Treatment of GRM1-expressing human melanoma cells with
a GRM1 antagonist (LY367385 or BAY36-7620) or a glutamate
release inhibitor (riluzole) leads to a suppression of cell
proliferation as well as a decrease in levels of extracellular
glutamate. Treatment of human melanoma cell xenografts
with riluzole for 18 days via p.o. gavage or i.v. injection leads
to inhibition of tumor growth by 50% in comparison with
controls. These data suggest the importance of glutamate
signaling in human melanoma and imply that the suppression
of glutamate signaling may be a new target for melanoma
therapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2298–305]

Introduction
The incidence of melanoma has been increasing for the past
several years. In the United States, more than 60,000 patients are
estimated to be diagnosed with melanoma with f8,000 deaths in
2006 (1). The overall lifetime risk of developing melanoma is 1 in 77
for women and 1 in 52 for men (1). Early detection is the key for
increased chance of survival; however, for late-stage melanoma,
currently there is no assuring therapeutic means. Animal models
have been a valuable tool to understand human disorders and to

identify new therapeutic targets for the treatments of a given
disease. Our laboratory has developed a mouse model for
melanoma and identified that the aberrant expression of
metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1) in melanocytes induces
spontaneous melanoma development in vivo (2, 3). The neoplastic
role of GRM1 is verified by a second transgenic line with GRM1
expression targeted to melanocytes by the use of a melanocytespecific dopachrome tautomerase promoter (4). Furthermore, we
showed that a subset of human melanoma cell lines and biopsy
samples displays aberrant GRM1 expression, suggesting involvement of GRM1 in some cases of human melanoma (4).
GRM1 is normally expressed and functional in the mammalian
central nervous system (CNS) and is implicated in learning and
memory formation (5). GRM1 belongs to the glutamate receptor
family, which is divided into two major groups: ionotropic
glutamate receptors (iGluR) and metabotropic glutamate receptors
(mGluR). mGluRs are seven-transmembrane domain G protein–
coupled receptors and are further subdivided into three groups
based on sequence homology and downstream signaling. GRM1
and GRM5 belong to group I mGluRs. Expression of GRM1 has not
been detected in melanocytes, whereas expression of GRM5 has
been detected in melanocytes (6). Previously, our laboratory has
shown that GRM5 does not play any role in melanoma development
(7). Several pharmacologic agents have been used extensively as
agonists and antagonists of GRM1 to elucidate the functions of
GRM1 in the CNS (8). L-quisqualate is an agonist for group I mGluRs
(8), whereas either LY367385 or BAY36-7620 is identified as a
competitive or noncompetitive antagonist of GRM1, respectively
(9, 10). These pharmacologic agents were crucial in previous studies
on GRM1 signaling in mouse melanoma cell lines (11).
Our laboratory has shown that stimulation of GRM1 by its
agonist, L-quisqualate, leads to the activation of mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) in mouse melanoma cell lines (11).
Constitutively activated MAPK pathway, specifically extracellularsignal regulated kinase (ERK), has been reported for human
melanoma cell lines and biopsies (12–14). In these earlier studies,
the presence of BRAF-activating mutation (V600E) is the driving
force for the activation of ERK. In this current report, we show that
MAPK pathway can be activated in GRM1-positive human
melanoma cell lines by GRM1 agonist in the absence of the
V600E BRAF-activating mutation.
In recent years, glutamate signaling in cancer has been a focus
of investigation by several laboratories. The antiproliferative
potential of iGluR antagonists has been examined in several types
of cancers, including breast, colon, astrocytoma, and lung (15).
Treatment of tumor cells with iGluR antagonists results in
inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and motility (15). Dizocilpine,
the iGluR antagonist, can suppress the growth of metastatic lung
adenocarcinoma through inhibition of the MAPK signaling

pathway (16). In addition to iGluR and GRM1, GRM4 has been
reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (17). These
studies implicate the involvement of glutamate signaling in tumor
development through mGluRs and/or iGluRs. In this current report,
we show the release of glutamate by several human melanoma cell
lines. Treatment of these melanoma cells with GRM1 antagonists
or an inhibitor of glutamate release, riluzole, suppresses glutamate
release and cell growth. In addition, riluzole diminishes tumor
growth in a xenograft model of human melanoma cells. Taken
together, these results suggest that GRM1 and glutamate signaling
may be used as novel targets for melanoma therapy.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and reagents. Anti–phosphorylated ERK, anti-ERK, and
anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were purchased from Cell
Signaling (Danvers, MA); GRM1 antibodies were purchased from BD
Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ) and ImmunoStar, Inc. (Hudson, WI); and
monoclonal a-tubulin antibody, myoinositol, and riluzole were obtained
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). DMSO was purchased from Fisher Scientific
(Pittsburgh, PA). L-quisqualate [(L)-(+)-a-amino-3,5-dioxo-1,2,4-oxadiazolidine-2-propanoic acid] and LY367385 [(S)-(+)-a-amino-4-carboxy-2-methylbenzeneacetic acid] were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). BAY36-7620
[(3aS,6aS)-6a-naphtalen-2-ylmethyl-5-methyliden-hexahydro-cyclopental[c]furan-1-on] was obtained from Bayer (West Haven, CT).
Cell culture. Primary human epidermal melanocytes (HEM) were
purchased from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) and maintained in
Medium 254 and human melanocyte growth supplements. UACC930,
UACC903, and A2058 were provided by Dr. Jeffrey M. Trent (Translational
Genomics Research Center, Phoenix, AZ). WM239A and WM35 were from
Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). C8161 and C81-61
were from Dr. Mary J.C. Hendrix (Children’s Memorial Research Center,
Chicago, IL). Melanoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). For glutamate measurement or induction experiments
with GRM1 agonist, to minimize glutamate in the medium, customized
glutamine- and glutamate-free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen-Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) was used with 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen-Life Technologies) and supplemented with 2 mmol/L GlutaMax (Invitrogen-Life
Technologies). For the measurement of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3),
customized glutamine- and glutamate-free RPMI 1640 was additionally
deprived of inositol (Invitrogen-Life Technologies).
Western immunoblots. Protein lysates were prepared as described
previously (18). In short, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. Extraction
buffer was added and cells were collected. After incubation on ice for
20 min, supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 4jC. Protein
concentration was determined using DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). Routinely, 25 Ag of protein lysates were loaded for Western
immunoblots.
IP3 measurements. IP3 was measured as described previously with
minor modifications (11, 19). After overnight incubation in the presence of
3 ACi of myo-[3H]inositol (3.22 TBq/mmol; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ),
cells were incubated in fresh glutamate/inositol/serum-free RPMI 1640 with
LiCl (10 mmol/L) for 15 min in the presence or absence of LY367385
(10 Amol/L) before stimulation with L-quisqualate (10 Amol/L) for 15 min.
The reactions were terminated and samples were either washed with the
addition of 1 mL of a 1:1 mixture of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (Sigma)
and tri-n-octalamine (Sigma) or washed twice with water-saturated diethyl
ether (Sigma). Levels of incorporated [3H]inositol in IP3 were measured by a
scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA).
DNA transfection. Transfections of DNA were done with N-[1-(2,3dioleoyloxyl)propyl]-N,N,N,-trimethylammoniummethyl sulfate liposomal
transfection reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Dominant-negative GRM1 (dnGRM1) constructs
were provided by Dr. Anna Francesconi (Albert Einstein College of
Medicine, Bronx, NY; refs. 11, 20). DNA transfections were done with 0.5
Ag of DNA per 60-mm plate.

3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell
proliferation assays. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assays were done according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Roche). Briefly, 103 cells were plated in 96-well plate and treated with
various compounds as indicated. Absorbance was measured by GENios
plate reader (Tecan, Durham, NC) for the time points indicated.
Measurement of extracellular glutamate. Amplex Red Glutamic Acid/
Glutamate Oxidase assay kit (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) was used to
measure the amount of glutamate released in the medium. Cells were
grown in medium devoid of glutamate and glutamine but supplemented
with GlutaMax (2 mmol/L) for 3 days. Cells were plated at 103 cells per well
with 200 AL of medium containing specific compounds with concentration
as indicated in 96-well plate. After specified time, 100 AL of medium were
collected for measurement of the amount of glutamate released according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells left with f100 AL of medium in the
wells were used to confirm the viability of cells by MTT cell proliferation
assays.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were plated at 2  106 per 100-mm culture
plate and treated as indicated. After 24 and 48 h, cells were collected and
washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were fixed by drop-wise
addition of ice-cold 70% ethanol and incubated for 20 min at 4jC. Fixed
cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 500 AL PBS.
Cells were treated with RNase A solution (20 Ag/mL; Sigma) and labeled
with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL; Sigma) for 30 min. Cell cycle analysis was
done by the Flow Cytometry Facility Core at Rutgers University (Piscataway,
NJ) using a Beckman Coulter system (Epics XL-MCL model).
Xenografts in immunodeficient nude mice. All animal studies were
approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Animal Care and
Facilities Committee of Rutgers University. Nude mice were purchased from
Taconic (Hudson, NY). Human melanoma cells, C8161, were injected into
the dorsal area at 106 cells per site. Tumor size was measured twice weekly
with a Vernier caliper and calculated as described (16). Treatment with
either vehicle (DMSO) or 7.5 mg/kg riluzole was given daily via p.o. gavage
or i.v. when tumor volumes reached 6 mm3. After 18 days of treatment,
experiments were terminated due to tumor burden, as tumor volume had
reached 300 mm3 in some animals.

Results
Functional GRM1 in human melanoma cells. Earlier, we
showed GRM1 expression in several human melanoma cell lines
and biopsy samples by reverse transcription-PCR and Western
immunoblots (4). Subsequent analysis of additional human
melanoma cell lines and biopsies showed that f40% of them
were positive for GRM1 expression. An example of immunoblots of
several human melanoma cell lines and normal primary HEMs is
shown (Fig. 1A). Expression of GRM1 was detected in some human
melanoma cell lines but not in HEM. Previously, our laboratory
showed MAPK to be an important signaling pathway in melanoma
cell lines derived from our transgenic lines (11). MAPK is one of the
key signaling pathways in human melanoma (21). We were
interested to know if MAPK pathway was also critical in GRM1positive human melanoma cells. It is well known that the common
BRAF-activating mutation (V600E) constitutively stimulates MAPK
signaling (14); therefore, genotypes of BRAF and N-Ras were
assessed by DNA sequencing in GRM1-positive human melanoma
cell lines. C8161 did not have the most common mutations at
either BRAF (codon 600) or N-Ras (codons 12, 13, and 61); however,
WM239A displayed a mutation in BRAF (V600D). Most of the
other cell lines showed the most common BRAF mutation (V600E;
data not shown).5 In human melanoma cell lines that bore the

Figure 1. A, GRM1 protein expression was detected in several human melanoma cell lines by immunoblots. HEM was used as a normal melanocyte control, and
a-tubulin was used as a loading control. B, the functionality of GRM1 was examined by GRM1 agonist–induced IP3 accumulation. Two human melanoma cell lines
(C8161 and WM239A) were stimulated with L-quisqualate alone (10 Amol/L; Q ) for 15 min or pretreated with LY367385 (10 Amol/L) for 15 min followed by stimulation
with L-quisqualate (LY/Q ) for 15 min. Data were expressed relative to no treatments (NT). FBS (10%) was used as a positive control (Ser). Columns, average of
three independent experiments of a representative cell line (WM239A); bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, compared with no treatment (t test); **, P < 0.05, compared with
L-quisqualate (t test). Statistically significant elevated levels of accumulated IP3 are detected in L-quisqualate–treated cells. Pretreatment of these cells with specific
antagonist of GRM1 LY367385 abolished L-quisqualate–induced IP3 accumulation. C, stimulation of GRM1 in human melanoma cell lines led to the activation of
ERK. Treatments of human melanoma cells with GRM1 agonist (10 Amol/L; Q) up to 10 min resulted in ERK phosphorylation. Pretreatment of these cells with LY367385
(10 Amol/L) for 30 min before L-quisqualate induction resulted in no modulation of phosphorylated ERK (pERK ; C8161 and WM239A). The membrane was stripped
and reprobed with total ERK.

most common activating mutation in BRAF (V600E), such as
UACC903, MAPK pathway was constitutively activated. As a
consequence, stimulation with GRM1 agonist did not lead to
further activation of ERK (data not shown). Therefore, cell lines
bearing the V600E BRAF mutation were excluded from further
studies. C8161 and WM239A were selected for subsequent analysis
of the involvement of GRM1 signaling in human melanoma.
Previously, we showed in mouse melanoma cell lines that GRM1
signals through Gq protein followed by phospholipase C, leading
to activation of second messengers, diacylglycerol and IP3 (11). To
examine the functionality of GRM1 in C8161 and WM239A, the
cells were stimulated with GRM1 agonist, L-quisqualate (Q), and
the accumulation of IP3 was measured (Fig. 1B). Cells were divided
into four groups: no treatment, serum as a positive control,
treatments with group I mGluR agonist (L-quisqualate), or
preincubation with GRM1-specific antagonist, LY367385, followed
by induction with L-quisqualate. To minimize the amount of
glutamate, the natural ligand of GRM1, glutamate- and glutaminefree media were used for the measurement of IP3 supplemented
with GlutaMax. We did three independent experiments with C8161
and WM239A human melanoma cell lines and representative data
are shown. In the presence of serum, an increase in levels of IP3
accumulation was detected when compared with no treatment.
Treatment with GRM1 agonist (L-quisqualate) for 15 min resulted
in a statistically significant increase in the accumulation of IP3. The
specificity of L-quisqualate–induced increase in IP3 accumulation
was shown by the absence of IP3 accumulation when these cells
were pretreated with GRM1 antagonist (LY367385) followed by
induction with L-quisqualate. The functionality of GRM1 in these

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

human melanoma cells was further confirmed by GRM1 agonist–
induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). L-quisqualate–induced
ERK activation was inhibited when these cells were pretreated with
LY367385 for 30 min before induction with L-quisqualate. Taken
together, these results showed that GRM1 receptors in these
human melanoma cell lines were functional and responded to
GRM1 agonist and antagonist.
Induction of apoptosis by dnGRM1. To further investigate
GRM1 functionality and activity in human melanoma cells, two
different but complimentary means were used to suppress GRM1
function. First, we took advantage of dnGRM1. These mutants have
a small deletion (DCT 694-695, DCT) or single base substitutions
(P698R, F781S, and F781P) in the intracellular loop 2 or 3, which
had been shown to be critical in GRM1 signaling (11, 20). Human
melanoma cell lines C8161 (Fig. 2A) and WM239A (Fig. 2B) were
transfected with vector control or four different dnGRM1 mutants.
At 24 h after transfection, protein lysates were collected for
Western immunoblots. PARP cleavage is a well-known apoptotic
marker by the appearance of the cleaved form at 89 kDa. PARP
cleavage was detected only in dnGRM1-transfected samples but
not in vector control (Fig. 2, top). Second panels show the levels of
exogenously transfected GRM1 to verify the presence of dnGRM1 in
these cells. dnGRM1 clones were made from a wild-type GRM1
cDNA from rat brain (20); therefore, anti-GRM1 antibody that only
recognizes the rodent forms of GRM1 was used. Apoptotic marker
was only observed in samples that had been transfected with
dnGRM1.
Inhibition of human melanoma cell proliferation by GRM1
antagonists. As a second approach, we used GRM1 antagonists to

Figure 2. dnGRM1 induced apoptosis in
C8161 (A ) and WM239A (B). Human
melanoma cells were transfected with
vector control or dnGRM1. Apoptosis was
assessed by the presence of the cleaved
form of PARP at 89 kDa at 24 h after
transfection. dnGRM1 constructs were
derived from cloned wild-type rat GRM1
cDNA (20). GRM1 antibody that only
recognizes the rodent form of GRM1 was
used to show the levels of transfected
GRM1 (dnGRM1). The membrane was
stripped and reprobed with GRM1 antibody
that recognized both endogenous (human)
and transfected GRM1 (GRM1). Negative
controls included no transfection and

examine GRM1 functionality and activity in human melanoma
cells. Several GRM1 antagonists had been described previously (8).
They are divided into two major groups: competitive and
noncompetitive. LY367385, a competitive antagonist, binds to the
same site as the natural ligand glutamate (9). BAY36-7620, one of
the noncompetitive antagonists, binds to the transmembrane
domain of the receptor resulting in stabilization of inactive
conformation (10). We used MTT cell proliferation assay to assess
growth response of human melanoma cells to the presence of
competitive or noncompetitive antagonist.
Human melanoma cells were grown in the presence of different
concentrations of LY367385 in RPMI 1640 devoid of glutamate and
glutamine supplemented with GlutaMax because LY367385 competes with the natural ligand glutamate for the binding to GRM1
receptor (Fig. 3A). The growth of primary HEMs requires special
medium supplemented with several growth factors, which contain
f70 Amol/L glutamate. In the absence of these factors and
glutamate, the growth of HEM was inhibited.6 Therefore, human
embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were used as a normal control
instead of HEM. Cell proliferation was measured for 4 days, and the
growth of C8161 was inhibited by 70% in the presence of 500 Amol/L
LY367385. There was only a negligible effect on the growth of HEK
cells at this concentration. In a parallel set of cells under same
conditions, protein lysates were prepared and levels of phosphorylated ERK were examined (Fig. 3B). A dose-dependent decrease in
levels of phosphorylated ERK was detected in cells treated with 100
or 500 Amol/L of LY367385 in comparison with no treatment or
vehicle treated. These results showed that treatment of GRM1positive human melanoma cells with LY367385, a competitive
GRM1 antagonist, resulted in suppression in cell proliferation and
that this suppression is likely, in part, due to inhibition of MAPK
signaling as indicated by a decrease in levels of activated
phosphorylated ERK.
Next, the growth of human melanoma cells was examined in the
presence of a GRM1 noncompetitive antagonist, BAY36-7620. As a
noncompetitive antagonist, BAY36-7620 does not compete for the
binding site with the natural ligand glutamate; therefore, regular
growth media were used for both human melanoma cells and

6

HEM. MTT cell proliferation assays were done with different
concentrations of BAY36-7620 (10–50 Amol/L) for 4 days and only
data for day 4 are shown (Fig. 3C). At 30 Amol/L BAY36-7620, only
30% of C8161 cells were viable, whereas >60% of HEM cells were
viable. Cell cycle analysis indicated that BAY36-7620–treated C8161
cells showed an increase in the sub-G1 phase after 48 h of
treatment, suggesting an induction of apoptosis by BAY36-7620
(data not shown). Protein lysates were prepared under the same
conditions, and PARP cleavage was used as an apoptotic marker.
Apoptosis was induced by BAY36-7620 at 50 Amol/L after 48 h as
shown by the cleaved form of PARP in comparison with controls
(Fig. 3D). These data indicated that a noncompetitive antagonist of
GRM1, BAY36-7620, inhibited human melanoma cell growth and
induced apoptosis, suggesting that GRM1 could be a target in
human melanoma therapy.
Inhibition of glutamate release by GRM1 antagonists in
human melanoma cells. It was puzzling to see only 15%
inhibition of melanoma cell growth by 100 Amol/L LY367385 in
C8161 cells (Fig. 3A), whereas 10 Amol/L LY367385 was sufficient in
the suppression of L-quisqualate–induced ERK activation (Fig. 1C).
Studies on mouse melanoma cells and mouse melanocytic clones
stably expressing GRM1 showed higher levels of released glutamate
than normal mouse melanocytes or vector controls.7 In light of
these results, levels of released glutamate by several human
melanoma cell lines were examined. Each day, half of the media
were collected and the amount of released glutamate was
determined. MTT assays were done to ensure that these cells were
viable. Again, because HEM, normal human melanocytes, required
growth factors as well as glutamate to grow, HEK cells were used as
a control. Regardless of whether they express GRM1, all human
melanoma cells examined released more glutamate than HEK. In
fact, substantial amount of glutamate was released into the
medium, especially by C8161 cells. An example of glutamate
released by HEK, C8161, and WM239A is shown (Fig. 4A, left). After
4 days, C8161 released f200 Amol/L glutamate into the medium,
which was f10 times the amount released by HEK. Although very
little glutamate was released by HEK cells, MTT assay showed their
vigorous growth (Fig. 4A, right). Next, we were interested to know if

GRM1 antagonists could inhibit the release of glutamate by these
cells. Treatment of C8161 cells with LY367385 resulted in a doseand time-dependent suppression in the levels of released glutamate
(Fig. 4B, left). When C8161 cells were treated with 500 Amol/L
LY367385, <30% of glutamate was released compared with controls,
which correlated with MTT assays. Under the same conditions, very
little influence on the glutamate released was detected in
LY367385-treated HEK cells (Fig. 4B, right). These results suggested
that a higher concentration of LY367385 was required to inhibit
GRM1-positive melanoma cell growth due to the constant release
of glutamate by these cells. Suppression of glutamate release was
also detected in cells treated with BAY36-7620, the noncompetitive
GRM1 antagonist (Fig. 4C). BAY36-7620 seemed to be more potent
in the suppression of glutamate release than LY367385.
Inhibition of cell proliferation by glutamate release inhibitor riluzole. Riluzole is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; also known
as Lou Gehrig’s disease). ALS is a degenerative motor neuron
disease that gets progressively worse with time. The actual cause of
ALS is not known; however, excessive glutamate, a major
neurotransmitter, has been proposed to be one of the factors that
promotes neuronal excitotoxicity leading to ALS (22). In clinical
trials, the inhibitor of glutamate release, riluzole, is shown to slow
down the progression of ALS (23, 24).

Our previous experiment suggested a correlation between levels
of released glutamate and cell proliferation (see above). Based on
these results, human melanoma cells were treated with riluzole.
Riluzole-treated C8161 cells released reduced levels of glutamate
(Fig. 4D). Suppression of glutamate release by riluzole also reduced
the growth of C8161 human melanoma cells (Fig. 5A). At 40 Amol/L
riluzole, <25% of C8161 cells were viable, whereas >70% of HEM cells
were viable, suggesting that HEM cells were less sensitive under
similar conditions. Cell cycle analysis on riluzole-treated C8161 cells
showed the accumulation of cells in the G2-M phase at 24 h (Fig. 5B,
top). By 48 h, there was a substantial increase in cells accumulated
in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle, suggesting cellular apoptosis
(Fig. 5B, bottom). To confirm these observations, PARP cleavage was
examined by Western immunoblots with C8161 cell lysates
prepared at 24 and 48 h after riluzole treatment (Fig. 5C). After
24 and 48 h of treatment with 10, 25, and 50 Amol/L of riluzole,
cleaved forms of PARP were detected in C8161. Results indicated
that treatments with riluzole inhibited growth of human melanoma
cells and induced cell cycle arrest leading to apoptosis. These
results prompted us to validate the antiproliferative, proapoptotic
action of riluzole in human melanoma cells in vivo.
Inhibition of human melanoma cell xenograft growth by

site. Based on the experiments done previously by others, the

Figure 3. A, biological responses of human melanoma cells to LY367385 were measured. Cells were treated with LY367385 at concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 500
Amol/L, respectively. No treatment (NT ) and 500 Amol/L NaOH (Veh ) were used as controls. Measurement of cell viability/growth was carried out by MTT assays
for 4 d. Only measurements on day 4 are shown here. Growth of C8161 cells was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner, whereas NaOH virtually had no effect on
cell growth (black columns ). LY367395 had minimal growth-inhibitory effect on HEK cells (white columns). Bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, compared with HEK (t test);
**, P < 0.001, compared with HEK (t test). B, the status of ERK phosphorylation after treatments with LY367385 was examined by immunoblots at day 4. C8161 cells
were not treated (NT ) or treated with 100 or 500 Amol/L of LY367385 or with 500 Amol/L NaOH (Veh ). Protein lysates were prepared for Western immunoblots
and probed with phosphorylated ERK. The same membranes were stripped and reprobed with total ERK. C, biological consequences of BAY36-7620 treatments in
HEM (white columns ) or C8161 (black columns) cells were measured by MTT cell viability assays. Cells were either not treated (NT ), vehicle treated (DMSO), or
treated with 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 Amol/L of BAY36-7620, respectively, for 4 d. In the presence of BAY36-7620, the growth of C8161 cells was suppressed in a
dose-dependent manner, whereas vehicle treatment had very little or no effect on cell growth. Only measurements on day 4 are shown here. HEM cells were less
sensitive to BAY36-7620 in comparison with C8161 cells. Bars, SD. *, P < 0.001, compared with HEM (t test). D, levels of cleaved PARP were examined by Western
immunoblots in C8161 treated with 10, 25, or 50 Amol/L of BAY36-7620 for 48 h. Elevated levels of cleaved PARP were only observed in C8161 cells treated with
50 Amol/L BAY36-7620 compared with DMSO treated (Veh ) or no treatment (NT ). The same blot was probed with a-tubulin to show equal loading.

Glutamate Signaling Is Important in Human Melanoma

Figure 4. A, human melanoma cell lines and HEK cells were examined for levels of released glutamate. Left, cells were plated in 96-well plates at 103 cells per well
and half of the media (100 AL) were collected to measure the amount of glutamate at indicated times; right, cells in the remaining half of the media (100 AL) were
proceeded to MTT cell proliferation assays. Media without cells were used as controls in each experiment (data not shown). At least three independent experiments
were done. All human melanoma cells, especially C8161, displayed elevated levels of extracellular glutamate in comparison with the control HEK. B, the ability of
the competitive GRM1 antagonist LY367385 to inhibit the release of glutamate was examined in C8161 and HEK cells at different concentrations for up to 4 d. The
vehicle control was 500 Amol/L NaOH. A dose-dependent inhibition of release of extracellular glutamate was observed only in LY367385-treated C8161 cells,
whereas very little, if any, inhibition was detected in HEK cells under the same conditions. C, treatment of C8161 cells with BAY36-7620, the noncompetitive GRM1
antagonist, also suppressed glutamate release. DMSO was used as a vehicle control. D, C8161 cells were treated with the glutamate release inhibitor riluzole.
Riluzole treatment of C8161 cells suppressed glutamate release. DMSO was used as a vehicle control.

maximum tolerated dose of riluzole8 was 20 mg/kg. Mice treated
with this dose for 2 years had no carcinogenic effects. Based on this
information and our pilot experiments, mice were treated with
7.5 mg/kg riluzole either by p.o. gavage or i.v. when tumor volume
had reached 6 mm3. Mice were treated every day for 18 days, and
tumor sizes were measured twice weekly with a Vernier caliper.
A significant reduction in tumor volume was observed only in mice
treated with 7.5 mg/kg riluzole by either i.v. (Fig. 6A) or p.o. gavage
(Fig. 6B) compared with untreated or vehicle-treated controls.
Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of using
riluzole to treat human melanoma.

Discussion
Glutamate signaling involves a large group of proteins, such as
mGluRs, iGluRs, and glutamate transporters with their effectors.
Involvement of glutamate signaling in the brain tumor, glioma, has

been under investigation for many years (25, 26). Recently, the
association of glutamate receptors with cancer of nonneuronal
origin has been the topic of research by several groups. Several
antagonists of iGluR were shown to inhibit tumor growth and
decrease in tumor cell motility in cancers, including breast, colon,
astrocytoma, and lung (15). Dizocilpine, iGluR antagonist, has also
been shown to suppress the growth of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma through the inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway (16).
In this report, we showed the importance of GRM1 signaling by
GRM1 antagonists or dnGRM1. Treatment of human melanoma
cells with LY367385, a GRM1-specific competitive antagonist,
exerted dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation by suppressing the activation of ERK, suggesting that activated GRM1 in
human melanoma cells mediates its signals in part through the
MAPK cascade, one of the major cell proliferation pathways. In
addition, a noncompetitive GRM1 antagonist, BAY36-7620, inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, transient
transfection of dnGRM1 into human melanoma cells induced apoptosis as shown by PARP cleavage.
We showed that human melanoma cells released elevated levels
of glutamate, the natural ligand of GRM1, into the medium.

Suppression of release of glutamate by pharmacologic agents
(LY367385, BAY36-7620, and riluzole) correlated with a reduction
in human melanoma cell growth. The direct involvement of
GRM1 in glutamate release has not yet been investigated
extensively. However, it has been reported that the two systems
work together to regulate extracellular glutamate levels: glutamate
uptake transporters and cystine-glutamate exchangers (27). In
studies of the rat prefrontal cortex, suppression of glutamate
uptake as well as stimulation of group I mGluRs (GRM1 and
GRM5) by their agonist, (R, S)-3,5-dihydroxy-phenylglycine, leads
to an increase in the accumulation of extracellular levels of
glutamate (27). This accumulation is inhibited by LY367385, a
GRM1 antagonist. The investigators speculated that LY367385 is
also an effective antagonist of cystine-glutamate exchangers;
however, the possibility of GRM1-mediated signaling to cystineglutamate exchangers could not be ruled out. Together, these
results suggest that GRM1 or its signaling may be associated with
glutamate release.
Glutamate is one of the major excitatory neurotransmitter.
There are several regulatory mechanisms involved in regulation of
release of glutamate, considering excessive glutamate leads to
neuronal cell death, excitotoxicity. Even as low as 2 to 5 Amol/L of
extracellular glutamate are sufficient to cause excitotoxicity in the

mammalian CNS (22). Regulation of glutamate release in neurons
involves iGluRs, glutamate transporters, as well as G protein
signaling. In glioma, the skull restricts tumor growth due to spatial
restriction (26). It has been hypothesized that, in order for glioma
cells to overcome the spatial restriction, excessive glutamate is
released to kill nearby neurons, therefore creating enough space for
tumor cells to grow. Excitotoxicity of neurons by glioma cells has
been shown by coculture of glioma cells with neurons (26). In
addition, when glioma cell clones were implanted to rat brain to
examine tumor growth, the subclone that release more glutamate
developed more aggressive forms of tumors than the original
parental glioma cells (25). Interestingly, brain is one of the common
metastatic sites for melanoma (28). It is possible that, when
melanoma metastasizes to brain, excess glutamate promotes
tumor growth and induces excitotoxicity in a very similar mode
of action as described for glioma.
Riluzole is the first FDA-approved drug for ALS; however, there
are only slight benefits to overall survival (22). The mechanisms of
action of riluzole include inhibition of glutamate release,
inactivation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels, and interference
with G protein–dependent signaling (29). Riluzole protects
neurons by suppression of glutamate release as well as suppression of ion channels. These neuroprotective properties by

Figure 5. A, MTT cell proliferation assays were used to assess the biological consequences of C8161 (black columns ) and HEM (white columns ) treated with riluzole.
Cells were plated on 96-well plate at 103 cells per well and treated with 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 Amol/L of riluzole. A dose-dependent suppression of C8161 cell growth by
riluzole was detected in comparison with no treatment (NT ) and DMSO treated (Veh ). Only day 4 measurements are shown here. HEM cells were less sensitive
to riluzole under similar conditions. Bars, SD. *, P < 0.001, compared with HEM (t test). B, cell cycle analysis was done with C8161 cells treated with riluzole at 24 h (top )
and 48 h (bottom ). At 24 h after treatment, cells were accumulated in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle. At 48 h after treatment, a 3-fold increase in the sub-G1 phase of
the cell cycle was detected. DMSO treatment (Vehicle ) had little or no effects. Each phase of cell cycle was indicated as C (sub-G1), D (G1), E (S), and F (G2-M),
and the percentage of cells in each phase was given. C, to investigate the apoptotic response of human melanoma cells to riluzole, cells were plated and treated with
10, 25, or 50 Amol/L of riluzole for 24 or 48 h. Protein lysates were extracted for Western immunoblots. After 24 and 48 h of riluzole treatments, apoptosis was induced in
C8161 cells as evident by PARP cleavage compared with no treatment (NT ) or DMSO treated (Veh ). The same blot was probed with a-tubulin to show equal loading.

Figure 6. Therapeutic potential of riluzole was investigated by C8161 xenograft model. C8161 human melanoma cells were inoculated s.c. in 6-week-old nude mice at
106 cells per site. When the tumor volumes had reached 6 mm3, mice were treated with 7.5 mg/kg riluzole daily by i.v. (A) or p.o. gavage (B ). Tumor sizes were
measured twice weekly with a Vernier caliper. Treatments were terminated after 18 d. Whether given by i.v. or p.o. gavage, a reduction in the tumor volumes
was detected in riluzole-treated mice in comparison with untreated or DMSO-treated (Veh) controls. Bars, SD. *, P < 0.01, compared with untreated and DMSO treated
(t test).

riluzole have been used to target several neurologic conditions,
including basal ganglion disease (29). We showed that treatment
of GRM1-positive human melanoma cells with riluzole results in
the reduced levels of released glutamate, the suppression of
human melanoma cell growth, as well as induction of apoptosis.
Furthermore, riluzole is shown to be effective in suppression of
tumor growth in a xenograft model. Taken together, these results
suggest the involvement of glutamate signaling in human
melanoma and that riluzole maybe a good candidate for human
melanoma therapy.
