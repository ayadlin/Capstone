ABSTRACT:
Mutation in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes occurs frequently in gliomas and other
human malignancies. In intermediate grade gliomas, IDH1 mutation is found in over
70% of tumors. These mutations impart the mutant IDH enzyme with a neomorphic
activity – the ability to synthesize 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). This ability leads to a
reprogramming of chromatin state, a block in differentiation, and the establishment
of the glioma hypermethylator phenotype (G-CIMP). It has been hypothesized but
not proven that the extensive DNA methylation that occurs in G-CIMP tumors helps
maintain and “lock in” glioma cancer cells in a dedifferentiated state. Here, we tested
this hypothesis by treating patient derived IDH1 mutant glioma initiating cells (GIC)
with non-cytotoxic, epigenetically targeted doses of the DNMT inhibitor decitabine.
Global methylome analysis of treated IDH1 mutant GICs showed that DAC treatment
resulted in reversal of DNA methylation marks induced by IDH and the re-expression
of genes associated with differentiation. Accordingly, treatment of IDH1 mutant
glioma cells resulted in a dramatic loss of stem-like properties and efficient adoption
of markers of differentiation, effects not seen in decitabine treated IDH wild-type
GICs. Induction of differentiation was much more efficient than that seen following
treatment with a specific inhibitor of mutant IDH enzyme (Agios). Decitabine also
decreased replicative potential and tumor growth in vivo. Reexpression of polycomb
regulated genes accompanied these DAC-induced phenotypes. In total, our data
indicates that targeting the pathologic DNA methylation in IDH mutant cells can
reverse mutant IDH induced hypermethylation and block in differentiation and
promote tumor control. These findings have substantial impact for exploring new
treatment strategies for patients with IDH mutant gliomas.

CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP), inhibiting
histone lysine demethylases and causing a block to cellular
differentiation [6-9].
It has been hypothesized that the extensive DNA
methylation that occurs in G-CIMP tumors maintains
glioma cancer cells in a dedifferentiated state. The
aberrant gene expression profile activated by mutant IDH1
confers a block to differentiation causing the malignant
expansion of tumor-initiating cells with capacity to
self-renew [6, 8]. These findings raise the possibility
that erasing the aberrantly hypermethylated marks may
reverse the differentiation block induced by mutant
IDH1. To explore this therapeutic possibility, we used the
DNA demethylating agent, decitabine, a Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved drug, to treat patient
derived glioma tumor cells. We analyzed the effects of
decitabine on both GICs with and without an endogeneous
IDH1 mutation. IDH1-mutant GIC has been described
previously [10].
The cytosine analogue 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine
(decitabine, DAC) is a hypomethylating agent used
as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome. DAC
exerts its effect by depletion and degradation of the
maintenance DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1. Exposure
to DNA demethylating agents is associated with altered
hematopoietic differentiation and results in terminal
differentiation of leukemia cells [11, 12]. Further, DAC
has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier – the
level of DAC attained in the cerebrospinal fluid can

reach as high as half of its plasma concentration after a
continuous intravenous infusion [13], making this drug
an attractive therapeutic option for the management of
gliomas. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of using
low, epigenetically targeted doses of DNA demethylating
agents in producing an antitumor memory response in both
leukemic and epithelial tumors, including inhibition of
subpopulations of cancer stem-cell like cells [14].
Although the impact of targeting the mutant enzyme
with an IDH1 specific inhibitor has been evaluated [10],
the effect was modest and did not lead to tumor regression.
The efficacy of using DNA demethylating agents to
treat mutant IDH1 expressing glioma cells has yet to be
tested. Our results indicate that transient low doses of
decitabine increases expression of genes associated with
glial-astrocytic differentiation and induces differentiation
in patient-derived IDH1-mutant tumor spheres. These
findings begin to explore the efficacy of using an FDA
approved drug in the management of IDH mutant gliomas.

RESULTS
DAC induces differentiation of mutant IDH1
expressing glioma cells
To study the effect of DAC on mutant IDH1
expressing gliomas, we utilized glioma tumor spheres

does not decrease 2HG levels. TS603 (IDH1 mutant) and TS667 (IDH wild-type) cells were treated as shown. For comparison, the mutant
IDH1 inhibitor AGI-5198 was used in parallel, which dramatically lowered 2-HG levels in the TS603 line. B, DAC induces a differentiated
morphology. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of DAC and bright-field images were taken at 10X magnification. At
200nM DAC, TS603 cells were adherent while the TS667 cells remained non-adherent spheres. C, DAC induces GFAP in TS603 cells but
not in TS667 cells. Results from western blot with the indicated antibodies are shown. D, Flow cytometry results showing induction of

that carry an endogenous heterozygous R132H mutation
(TS603). These cells were derived from a patient with
WHO grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma and harbor
a co-deletion of 1p and 19q. TS603 exhibits the G-CIMP
phenotype and produces high 2HG levels in vitro [10]. As
a control, we used the IDH wild-type oligogendroglioma
tumor sphere line TS667. We used DAC at a nanomolar
range (10, 100 and 200 nM) to treat TS603 and TS667
glioma cells. These levels are non-cytotoxic [14]. 2-HG
levels were unchanged in pellets of TS603 glioma cells
after 7 days of treatment (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, 3 days of
continuous exposure to DAC led to dramatic changes
in the morphology of TS603 cells. At the 200 nM dose,
treated TS603 cells exhibited a differentiated morphology
and became adherent (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the
differentiation phenotype was dose dependent, and was
observed even at 10 nM DAC where some cells grew as
adherent spheres with a few differentiated cells in between
spheres (Fig. 1B). Vehicle treated TS603 and TS667 cells
and DAC treated TS667 cells continued to grow strictly as
non-adherent spheres in culture and did not differentiate,
suggesting that the differentiation phenotype is IDH1
mutant specific.
Next, we assessed protein levels of GFAP, a marker
for glial differentiation. GFAP protein expression was

markedly increased in TS603 cells after 3-day treatment
with 100 or 200 nM DAC compared to vehicle treated
cells (Fig. 1C, D). We did not observe any increase in
GFAP expression in IDH wild-type TS667 cells.
We sought to determine whether transient treatment
with DAC resulted in a “memory” type response that
has recently been shown for transient low doses of DNA
demethylating agents in hematological and epithelial
tumors [14]. To test this hypothesis, we treated TS603 for
7 days with 200 nM DAC, followed by drug withdrawal
and culture in drug-free media for 3 weeks. While DNMT1
protein levels quickly recovered, the differentiation
phenotype was maintained (but did reverse slowly) and
transiently treated cells continued to grow as adherent
cells (Fig. 1E).
Taken together, these results indicate that decitabine
is able to efficiently reverse the differentiation block
induced by mutant IDH1.

ability of TS603 cells in soft agar, with >90% reduction in
colony formation ability occurring after 7-day exposure
(Fig. 2A, left panel). In addition, cell growth was also
suppressed by 60% in mutant IDH1 expressing TS603
after 3- and 7- days of 200 nM DAC treatment (Fig. 2B,
left panel). Although potent in the IDH mutant cells, the
decrease in tumorigenicity was not entirely specific to
TS603 cells. TS667 cells also showed decreased colony
formation ability and cell growth, although the affect was
not as dramatic and only occurred after 7 days of treatment
with 200 nM DAC. (Fig. 2A-B, right panels)
Next, we tested the efficacy of combining DAC
with AGI-5198, a mutant IDH1 specific inhibitor. AGI5198 is highly selective for R132H mutation and under
near complete 2HG inhibition induces modest expression
of differentiation-associated genes. This is accompanied
by decreased proliferation of IDH1-mutant glioma cells,
without causing significant changes in genome-wide DNA
methylation levels [10]. The effects of AGI-5198 were
subtle and tumor regression never occurred. Therefore, we
hypothesized that pre-treatment with 200 nM DAC may
further ‘sensitize’ the IDH1-mutant glioma cells to the
therapeutic effects of AGI-5198. TS603 and TS667 cells
were treated for 7 days with 200 nM DAC, followed by
DAC removal and plating in soft agar, at which point the
cells were either treated with 1μM of AGI-5198 or DMSO
continuously for 3 weeks. Pre-treatment with DAC did
not allow the TS603 cells to respond more effectively to
AGI-5198 (Fig. 2C). The numbers of colonies in DAC
pretreated cells were similar between inhibitor and
DMSO treated TS603 glioma cells, indicating that the
dramatic reduction in anchorange-independent growth
can be attributed to DAC alone. AGI-5198 did not cause
additional loss of anchorage-independent growth.

To test the growth inhibitory effects of DAC in vivo,
we treated TS603 and TS667 cells with 200 nM DAC for
7 days in vitro. We injected DAC or vehicle treated cells
into the flanks of untreated SCID mice. Treatment with
DAC markedly reduced the growth of TS603 xenografts
by >90%. On the contrary, growth was more modestly
impaired in the IDH1-wild-type TS667 glioma xenografts
when compared to the IDH1-mutant expressing TS603
glioma xenografts (Fig. 3A). DAC treatment induced
strong GFAP expression in IDH mutant TS603 cells but
not in IDH wild-type TS667 cells (Fig. 3B).

Low dose DAC inhibits genome-wide methylation
and induces expression of genes associated with
glial differentiation
We evaluated the biochemical efficacy of DAC at
low doses by assessing DNMT1 protein depletion after
treatment. At the doses used, no cell death occurred.
Both 3- and 7-day transient treatments with 100 and 200
nM DAC depleted DNMT1 levels, whereas 10 nM dose
resulted in diminished levels of DNMT1 in TS603 and
TS667 glioma cells (Fig. 4A). Maximal depletion of
DNMT1 was rapid and occurred as early as following a
3-day treatment.
To assess genome-wide changes in methylation
levels, we treated TS603 and TS667 glioma cells with
vehicle, 100 nM DAC, 200 nM DAC or 1μM AGI-5198
continuously for 2 weeks. DNA methylation was assessed
using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip. Overall, there was a significant reduction in
the number of methylated loci in both TS603 and TS667
glioma cells, although the degree of hypomethylation

was more pronounced in the IDH1-wild-type TS667 line
(Fig. 4B). After a 2-week exposure to 200 nM DAC,
30,915 probes (corresponding to 9996 unique genes) were
hypomethylated in IDH1 mutant TS603 glioma cells and
130,017 probes (corresponding to 17,182 unique genes)
were hypomethylated in TS667 cells (Δβ value < -0.4)
(Supplemental Table 1). In contrast, only 52 probes were
hypomethylated at Δβ < -0.4 in TS603 line after a 2-week
treatment with 1μM AGI-5198 (Supplemental Table
1). Therefore, low dose DAC was a potent inhibitor of
DNMT1 and loss of DNA methylation.
In addition to genome-wide methylation, we also
assessed gene expression changes using Affymetrix gene
expression arrays following a 2-week treatment with
DMSO, 100nM DAC, 200 nM DAC or AGI-5198. In
TS603 glioma cells, 411 unique genes were upregulated
and 82 genes were downregulated after DAC treatment
(Supplemental Table 2). Compared with vehicle-treated
TS603 cells, low dose transient DAC treatment resulted
in the upregulation of a number of genes associated with

glial-astrocytic differentiation, such as GFAP and LGALS3
[15], whereas NEUROD1, a gene associated with neural
stem cells, was downregulated (Fig. 4C). Some of the most
significantly enriched pathways (BH-adjusted p < 0.05)
among the upregulated genes included ECM-receptor
interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and
vasculature development (Supplemental Table 3).
When compared to vehicle treated cells, in IDH
wild-type TS667 glioma cells, 385 unique genes were
upregulated and 78 genes were downregulated after DAC
treatment. Overall, 110 genes were upregulated in both
cell lines after 200 nM DAC treatment, and upregulation
of GFAP and other glial differentiation markers was not
evident in TS667 glioma cells (Supplemental Table 2).
We next integrated the DNA methylation and gene
expression data to identify genes that increase their gene
expression following loss of methylation. Compared to
vehicle treated controls, 79% of all the upregulated genes
in TS667 cells were hypomethylated. In TS603 glioma
cells, 48% of all upregulated genes (197 genes) were also

hypomethylated (Supplemental Table 4). Importantly,
this group also included all the differentiation-associated
genes. To gain further insight into the genes with increased
expression following 200nM DAC treatment in TS603
cells, our gene set consisting of hypomethylated and
upregulated genes were analyzed using the molecular
signature database (MSigDB) and the degree of overlap
with the c2 curated gene sets was calculated. These results
showed highly significant enrichment of NUYTTEN_
EZH2_TARGETS_UP, which includes genes up-regulated
in PC3 cells following EZH2 knockdown [16], indicating
that DAC treatment may erase methylation marks from
Polycomb EZH2 marked loci and subsequently activate
genes involved in differentiation (Fig. 4D). These data
point to the re-expression of Polycomb controlled genes as
playing an important role in how DAC reverses the effects
of mutant IDH.

different mechanism of action induced by DAC. Given the
vast heterogeneity of glioma, a broader investigation of
the differential therapeutic responses of glioma subgroups
to transient low doses of DNA demethylating agents will
shed light onto the therapeutic benefit of these agents
as either mono- or combination therapies. Importantly,
a companion paper by Greg Riggin’s group at Johns
Hopkins shows analygous results using a separately
derived IDH mutant GIC line [19]. Together, our studies
highlight the therapeutic potential of DNMT inhibitors for
treatment of IDH mutant tumors.
The use of DAC to target mutant IDH dependent
pathobiology is tantalizing. DAC is already FDA approved
and penetrates the CNS very well. In our preclinical
models, we show that using DAC can effectively reverse
the pathologic DNA methylation induced by mutant
IDH. Based on our data, we hypothesize that DAC may
be useful for other tumor types, such as leukemias and
chondrosarcomas, which have IDH mutation.
In summary, our findings highlight the utility of
DNA demethylating agents in the management of glioma,
a highly malignant disease with dismal prognosis. The
ability to induce a sustained differentiation phenotype
in the tumor-initiating subpopulation of IDH1 R132H
gliomas may provide a promising therapeutic window of
opportunity for tumors with this mutation.

DISCUSSION
Tumor-initiating cells are thought to contribute
to relapse or tumor recurrence after treatment,
therefore a major challenge is to discover agents or
treatment paradigms that will target this stem-cell like
subpopulation. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy
of DNA demethylating agents in targeting gliomainitiating cells and highlight the differential response
of IDH1 mutant versus IDH1 wild-type glioma cells to
low doses of DAC. Transient exposure to nanomolar
concentrations of DAC induces the differentiation of the
IDH1 R132H, but not IDH1 wild-type glioma-initiating
cells. Importantly, exposure to nanomolar doses of DAC
has long-lasting effects on continued differentiation, long
after the demethylating agent is removed and DNMT1
levels are restored. This may be explained by the fact that
exposure to DNA demethylating agents removes the DNA
methylation marks at the promoters of glial differentiation
genes such as GFAP and may also relax the formation
of heterochromatin at the promoters of differentiation
genes leading to their upregulation. In conjunction with
increased differentiation in IDH1 R132H glioma cells,
DAC also exerts its antitumor effects by reducing the
tumorigenic potential of IDH1-mutant cells by decreasing
colony formation in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. It
remains to be seen whether DNA demethylating agents
can sensitize glioma-initiating cells to other cytotoxic
or targeted drugs, as has been suggested in lung and
ovarian cancers [17, 18]. In our initial studies, we have
not observed sensitization of IDH1-mutant glioma cells to
IDH1 R132H specific inhibitor, AGI-5198 following DAC
exposure; however, further studies are needed.
Our studies also indicate that growth of IDH1 wildtype glioma cells are reduced following transient treatment
with DAC, albeit through alternate pathways. The distinct
gene expression program and the lack of differentiation
phenotype observed in IDH1-wild-type cells suggest a

METHODS
Generation of patient derived glioma-initiating
cells and drug treatment.
IDH1-R132H TS603 and IDH1-wild-type TS667
glioma spheres were derived from patients undergoing
tumor resection at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center (MSKCC). Tumors were obtained in accordance
with Institutional Review Board policies at MSKCC. 10
nM, 100 nM , 200 nM Decitabine (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) ,1 μM of AGI-5198 IDH1 R132H specific
inhibitor (Xcess Bio) or DMSO were added to the media.
Decitabine was added every 24 hours with daily medium
change and AGI-5198 was added every other day with
medium change.

Soft agar assays.
Cells were treated with decitabine for 3- or 7- days
before plating for soft agar. 100,000 cells were plated in
complete Neurocult media with growth supplements (Stem
Cell Technologies) into 6-well plates containing 0.65% top
and bottom agar. Cells were plated in the middle layer in
complete Neurocult media containing 0.40% agar. Cells
were treated with or without AGI-5198 for 3-4 weeks,
and media was refreshed every 2 days. After 2-4 weeks,

colonies were stained with 0.0005% crystal violet and
quantified using a Gelcount colony counter (Oxford
Optronix).

Expression analysis was performed using the
Affymetrix U133 2.0 microarray (Affymetrix). Genomewide methylation analysis was performed using the
Infinium HumanMethylation450 bead array (Illumina).
Processing of the arrays was per the manufacturers’
protocol. Methylation data were extracted using
GenomeStudio software (Illumina). Methylation values
for each site are expressed as a beta (β) value, representing
a continuous measurement from 0 (completely
unmethylated) to 1 (completely methylated). This value
is based on following calculation: β value = (signal
intensity of methylation-detection probe)/(signal intensity
of methylation- detection probe + signal intensity of nonmethylation detection).

Xenografts.
TS603 and TS667 glioma cells were pretreated with
200 nM decitabine or DMSO for 7 days. After harvesting,
1x106 cells were injected subcutaneously (100 μl volume,
equal parts Matrigel and media) into both flanks of 5-6
week old female SCID mice. Once tumors researched a
palpable size, tumor size was measured every 3-4 days by
a caliper. Protocols for all treatments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and strict
guidelines were enforced.

Western blot.

Data analysis.

Cells were lysed in CelLytic (Sigma) with protease
inhibitors (Roche). Proteins were separated by SDS–
PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore) and
probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-IDH1
R132H (Dianova, DIA-H09), anti-DNMT1 (New England
Biolabs, M0230S), anti-GFAP (Cell Signaling Tech,
2118S) and anti-β-actin (Sigma, A5316).

For methylation analysis, Illumina data were
imported into Partek software. β values for 200 nM DAC
or 1uM AGI-5198 treated cells were substracted from
β values for DMSO treated cells. Any probe with Δβ <
-0.4 were considered to be hypomethylated following
treatment. For gene expression analysis, microarrays
were RMA normalized and fold changes were calculated
by subtracting the log intensity values of 200 nM DAC
or 1uM AGI-5198 from DMSO treated cells, and probes
with absolute fold changes > 1.2 were considered to be
differentially expressed. DAVID was used to identify
significantly overrepresented pathways [20]. For gene
set analysis, hypomethylated and upregulated genes were
input into the molecular signature database (MSigDB) and
statistical significance of overlaps were calculated between
our gene sets and the C2 (curated gene sets) library from
MSigDB.

Flow Cytometry.
For single-color flow cytometry, 106 cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS, permeabilized and fixed using
BD Cytoperm/Cytofix solution (BD, PharMingen), and
incubated with anti-GFAP (1:200, BD Pharmingen) for
30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with
PBS and analyzed with FACScan flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter data were
analyzed using FLowJo Software (TreeStar).

2-HG analysis.

Immunohistochemistry.

2HG levels were determined by mass spectrometry
as previously described [6].

Paraffin-embedded sections of xenografts were
deparaffinized. The sections were then stained with either
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Ki-67 or GFAP. Detection
was performed with the DAB Map kit (Ventana Medical
Systems).
