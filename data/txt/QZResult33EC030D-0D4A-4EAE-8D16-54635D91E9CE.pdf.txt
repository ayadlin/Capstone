Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remains a lethal malignancy despite tremendous
progress in its molecular characterization. Indeed, PDA tumors harbor four signature somatic
mutations1–4, and a plethora of lower frequency genetic events of uncertain significance5. Here,
we used Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis6,7 in a mouse model
of pancreatic ductal preneoplasia8 to identify genes that cooperate with oncogenic KrasG12D to
accelerate tumorigenesis and promote progression. Our screen revealed new candidates and
confirmed the importance of many genes and pathways previously implicated in human PDA.
Interestingly, the most commonly mutated gene was the X-linked deubiquitinase Usp9x, which
was inactivated in over 50% of the tumors. Although prior work had attributed a pro-survival role
to USP9X in human neoplasia9, we found instead that loss of Usp9x enhances transformation and
protects pancreatic cancer cells from anoikis. Clinically, low USP9X protein and mRNA
expression in PDA correlates with poor survival following surgery, and USP9X levels are
inversely associated with metastatic burden in advanced disease. Furthermore, chromatin
modulation with trichostatin A or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine elevates USP9X expression in human
PDA cell lines to suggest a clinical approach for certain patients. The conditional deletion of
Usp9x cooperated with KrasG12D to rapidly accelerate pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice,
validating their genetic interaction. Therefore, we propose USP9X as a major new tumor
suppressor gene with prognostic and therapeutic relevance in PDA.

The biological sequelae of PDA has been partially attributed to frequent and well
characterized mutations in KRAS (>90%), CDKN2A (>90%), TP53 (70%) and SMAD4
(55%)1–4. Recent genome-wide analyses have uncovered numerous additional somatic
genetic alterations, although the functional relevance of most remains uncertain5. To explore
the molecular genesis of PDA we previously generated a mouse model of Pancreatic
Intraepithelial Neoplasia (mPanIN) by conditionally expressing an endogenous KrasG12D
allele in the developing pancreas8. Mice with mPanIN spontaneously progress to mouse
PDA (mPDA) after a long and variable latency, providing an opportunity to characterize
genes that cooperate with KrasG12D to promote early mPDA. We hypothesized that such
genes could be directly identified by applying insertional mutagenesis strategies6,7,10,11 in
our mPanIN model, and that these candidates could represent “drivers” of PDA
development.

Accordingly, we interbred our mPanIN model with two distinct Sleeping Beauty (SB)
transposon systems and monitored mice for early disease progression. Our initial approach
utilized the well characterized CAGGS-SB10 transgenic allele to promote transposition6.
Although CAGGS-SB10 promoted PDA, a variety of non-pancreatic neoplasms and a
paucity of identified Common Insertion Sites (CISs) in the recovered pancreatic neoplasms
precluded a comprehensive analysis, potentially reflecting the variegated expression of
CAGGS-SB1012 (Supplementary Figures 1a and 2; Supplementary Tables 1 and 3b).

To increase the specificity and potency of SB mutagenesis, we generated a conditional SB13
mutant mouse by targeting the Rosa26 locus in embryonic stem cells (Supplementary Fig.
3a, b). The pancreatic specific expression and function of the conditional SB13 allele was
confirmed (Supplementary Fig. 3c), and we found that SB13-induced transposition by itself
did not promote lethality or pancreatic tumorigenesis (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 4a). In
contrast, KCTSB13 mice (KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-cre; T2/Onc; Rosa26-LSL-SB13) rapidly
progressed and succumbed to invasive pancreatic neoplasms (Fig. 1a–c). A cohort of 117
KCTSB13 mice (Supplementary Fig. 1b) was monitored for tumor development, and 103 of
these mice were available for full necropsy and tissue procurement. The majority of such
mice harbored multi-focal pancreatic tumors, and 198 distinct primary tumors and
metastases were subjected to histological and molecular analysis. Most mice had invasive
carcinomas (66/103) that consisted of classical mPDA (78.8%) or invasive cystic neoplasms
(21.2%); 34.8% of mice also contained metastases predominantly in their liver and lungs
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). The remainder of the mice (37/103) had preinvasive pancreatic
tumors consisting of high grade mPanIN and cyst-forming papillary neoplasms
(Supplementary Fig. 4b).

The candidate genes identified from the SB13 screen represented unanticipated candidates
as well as many genes and pathways previously implicated in human PDA (Table 1,
Supplementary Tables 2, 3a and 4). Indeed, various members of the TGFβ pathway,
including Smad3, Smad4, Tgfbr1 and Tgfbr2, were collectively mutated in 32% of the
tumors. Also, the Rb/p16Ink4a pathway was disrupted in 21% of the tumors. CISs
representing the orthologues of additional human PDA genes included Fbxw7 (24.2%),
Arid1a (19.1%), Acvr1b (19%), Stk11/Lkb1 (6.5 %), Mll3 (6%), Smarca4 (6%) and Pbrm1
(4.5%)5,13–15. Trp53 was the only commonly mutated PDA gene conspicuously absent,
although the p53 regulatory deubiquitinase Usp7 was a CIS (6.5%)16. Several CISs
previously noted in insertional mutagenesis screens for hepatocellular carcinoma or
gastrointestinal tract adenomas, but not typically mutated in PDA, were also identified in
this study, including Zbtb20, Nfib and Ube2h in liver tumors10; and Pten, Tcf12, Ppp1r12a,
and Ankrd11 in gastrointestinal tract adenoma/adenocarcinoma11. This indicates that many
tumor progression pathways may be common to pancreatic, liver and gastrointestinal/
colorectal tumors.
Unexpectedly, the most frequent CIS observed was the X-linked deubiquitinase Usp9x, a
gene that had not been previously associated with PDA or other types of carcinoma in
humans or mouse models. Indeed, the COSMIC data base revealed only one USP9X
mutation in a case of ovarian cancer, although the functional relevance of this mutation has
not been characterized (COSMIC mutation ID: 73237). Usp9x was disrupted in over 50% of

all tumors, with 341 insertions noted in the 101 tumors harboring this CIS (Fig. 1d, Table 1).
Furthermore, Usp9x was also identified as a CIS in 4 samples from the initial SB10 screen
(Supplementary Table 1), supporting its candidacy as a PDA genetic determinant. We
confirmed that Usp9x was disrupted in tumors by isolating chimeric fusion mRNAs that
spliced the Usp9x transcript to the T2/Onc transposon (Fig. 1e). In addition, the Usp9x
protein was specifically absent in neoplastic cells in pancreatic tumors bearing intragenic
insertions (Fig. 1f, g).

Author Manuscript

To characterize the cellular and molecular pathways affected by Usp9x in PDA, RNAi was
used to deplete Usp9x in mPDA cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 5a). While Usp9x depletion
did not affect the proliferation of monolayer cultures (Supplementary Fig. 5b), it
significantly increased colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 5c),
compared to cells transfected with scrambled shRNAs. Additionally, Usp9x knock-down
potently suppressed anoikis in mPDA cells (Fig. 2b). These properties of Usp9x were
predominantly dependent upon its intrinsic deubiquitinase activity (Supplementary Fig. 6a,
b).
Since USP9X was previously reported to positively regulate SMAD4 transcriptional
activity17 and SMAD4 is commonly mutated in PDA4, we hypothesized that Usp9x loss
would attenuate Smad4 function or TGFβ responsiveness in PDA cell lines. However,
irrespective of Usp9x expression level, mPDA cell lines expressed Smad4 and were equally
sensitive to p21 induction, growth inhibition and morphological alterations following
exposure to TGF-β1 (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). Therefore we were unable to ascribe a
specific role to Usp9x in the regulation of the Smad4/TGFβ pathway in mPDA cells or
tumors.

We next investigated several additional proteins reported to be regulated by Usp9x and
involved in pathways relevant to cellular transformation. Although USP9X was previously
shown to bind to and regulate two proteins involved in cell survival, ASK118 and MCL19,19,
we could not detect obvious changes in Ask1 or Mcl1 protein levels upon Usp9x loss (Fig.
2c). Usp9x has also been reported to deubiquitinate and thereby stabilize the E3 ligase
Itch20, decreased protein levels of Itch were observed in mouse and human PDA cells upon
the depletion of Usp9x (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 8a). Importantly, ectopic Itch
expression was sufficient to promote anoikis in mPDA cells (Fig. 2d), and Itch was partially
responsible for the ability of Usp9x to promote anoikis and suppress colony formation
(Supplementary Fig. 6c, d). Since Itch is known to promote the degradation of several
proteins relevant to cell proliferation and survival21, we evaluated the protein expression of
likely candidates including c-Jun, p63 and c-FLIP but observed no alterations
(Supplementary Fig. 8b). Furthermore, the Itch gene was identified as a CIS in 13% of cases
(Supplementary Table 2). Therefore, Usp9x mutation may promote tumorigenesis in part by
disabling Itch function, and the Usp9x/Itch pathway may work to constrain pancreatic
tumorigenesis.
To determine whether USP9X expression is aberrant in human PDA, three distinct patient
cohorts were assessed. First, we analyzed a cohort of 100 Australian patients who underwent
surgery for localized PDA and had detailed information available concerning clinical-

pathological characteristics and outcome (Supplementary Fig. 9, Supplementary Tables 5,
6). Tumor DNA from 88 patients in this cohort failed to yield somatic mutations in USP9X,
consistent with prior reports5 (data not shown). Importantly, the low expression of USP9X
mRNA correlated with poor survival following surgery (p=0.0076) (Fig. 3a), and
multivariate analysis revealed that USP9X expression was an independent poor prognostic
factor following surgery (Supplementary Table 7). We next analyzed autopsy specimens
from a separate cohort of 42 American patients to determine that USP9X protein expression
inversely correlated with a widespread metastatic pattern (p=0.0212) (Fig. 3b), and bore no
relation to SMAD4 expression (Supplementary Table 8). A third collection of PDA
specimens obtained from resected German patients (n=404) were used to determine that
USP9X and ITCH protein levels were decreased (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b) and
concordant (Spearman-Rho correlation: 0.47; p<0.01) (Supplementary Table 9a) in tumors
compared to normal pancreatic tissue. Additionally, the proportion of tumors that had
undetectable USP9X (13.6%) or ITCH (30.5%) protein correlated with a worse outcome
(Supplementary Fig. 11, Supplementary Table 9b, c), particularly regarding USP9X in the
subset of high grade tumors (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). Collectively, these
findings implicate the loss of USP9X expression as a relevant event in human pancreatic
cancer progression.

Author Manuscript

We found that USP9X was expressed throughout murine and human tumor development and
lost focally in PDAs (Supplementary Figures 12, 13). Additionally, human PDA cell lines
expressed lower levels of USP9X compared to non-PDA cancer cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. 14). To investigate additional potential mechanisms of USP9X regulation in PDA,
human cell lines were treated with the DNA methylase inhibitor 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine and
the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. Both inhibitors modestly increased the USP9X mRNA
and protein levels in most cell lines, suggesting that USP9X may be epigenetically silenced
in vivo (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 15). Furthermore, although the promoter region of
USP9X was not heavily methylated in tumor samples or PDA cells harboring low protein
expression (data not shown), treatment with 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine did decrease colony
formation of human PDA cells and this was partially reversed by concomitantly knockingdown USP9X (Supplementary Fig. 16).

Author Manuscript

To confirm that KrasG12D cooperated with Usp9x loss to promote pancreatic cancer, a
conditional Usp9xflallele was generated (Supplementary Fig. 17a) and interbred with
KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-cre mice to evaluate the impact on mPanIN progression. The mosaic
expression of Usp9x in pancreas from Pdx1-cre; Usp9xfl/y mice was confirmed by
immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. 17b). We found that all hemizygous male mice
and heterozygous female mice carriers of the Usp9xfl allele in the background of
KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-cre rapidly developed advanced mPanIN and microinvasive neoplasms
within 3 months of age (Fig. 3e–f, Supplementary Fig. 18). Immunohistochemical analysis
of mPanINs from heterozygous female mice demonstrated absence of Usp9x expression in
the preneoplastic and neoplastic cells (Supplementary Fig. 18), implicating additional events
such as X inactivation of the other locus in female mice22,23. mPanINs in KrasLSL-G12D;
Pdx1-cre; Usp9xfl mice expressed intranuclear Smad4, similar to KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-cre
mice (Supplementary Fig. 19a). Additionally, early passage pancreatic cell cultures prepared

from these mice confirmed the absence of the Usp9x protein and altered regulation of Itch
(Supplementary Fig. 19b). Although some mice died of local or metastatic pancreatic
cancer, aggressive oral papillomas often required the culling of young mice and
demonstrated that KrasG12D and Usp9x loss also cooperated to transform keratinocytes
(Supplementary Fig. 19c).

Author Manuscript

Although a recent report implicated USP9X as a pro-survival gene by stabilizing MCL19,
potential inhibitors of USP9X should be developed with caution since we find that Usp9x
has tissue specific effects including a tumor suppressor role in oncogenic Kras-initiated
pancreatic carcinoma. USP9X is likely epigenetically silenced in a subset of PDA, thus
explaining why prior DNA sequencing efforts have failed to identify this as participant in
carcinogenesis, and offering the possibility that clinically available epigenome modulators
may be useful agents to investigate in such patients. ITCH is a likely mediator of pancreatic
tumor suppression by USP9X, and continued investigation of the USP9X/ITCH pathway is
warranted. More generally, the identification of Usp9x through the use of transposon
mutagenesis reaffirms the utility of in vivo mouse cancer screens to complement the direct
investigation of human cancer.

mutant mice represented the comparison cohorts. KrasLSL-G12D and Pdx1-Cre mice were
interbred with Usp9xfl mice to generate the KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-Cre; Usp9xfl/+ and
KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-Cre; Usp9xfl/y (KCU) compound mutant mice, as well as the two
control cohorts Pdx1-cre; Usp9xfl/y (CU) and KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-cre (KC). Usp9xfl mice
were generated by Ozgene Pty. Ltd (Bentley, Australia). Mice were maintained in
compliance with the UK home office regulations. Splinkerette PCRs were performed as
described previously25,26. Reads from sequenced tumors were mapped to the mouse genome
assembly NCBI m37 and merged together to identify SB insertion sites, as previously
described25. Redundant sequences, as well as insertions in the En2 gene and in the T2/Onc
donor concatemer resident chromosome (chromosome 1), were removed. Mouse survival
curves and cell culture experiments were analyzed with the GraphPad prism program. The
IHC histoscoring from the TMA samples and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed
with SPSS18, and the Spearman-Rho correlation coefficient (2-sided) between USP9X and
ITCH was calculated. The IHC USP9X histoscore and analysis was conducted using the
Fishers Exact Test on post-mortem samples. The GEO accession number for the ICGCAPGI gene expression data is GSE36924.

CIS analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

For the statistical analysis, 90,007 non-redundant insertion sites (Supplementary Table 3)
were used to identify CISs using a Gaussian Kernel Convolution framework (GKC)28. An
enhanced version of the framework was developed for SB screens to account for the local
density of TA sites within the genome25. For example, a genomic region containing a large
number of insertion sites but a low density of TA sites is considered to be significant and
thereby identified as a candidate CIS. Conversely, a region with a large number of insertion
sites but also containing a high density of TA sites is determined to be less significant, since
the transposons have more “target” sites into which they can integrate. Multiple kernel
scales were employed in the GKC framework (widths of 15K, 30K, 50K, 75K, 120K and
240K nucleotides). CISs predicted across multiple scales and overlapping in their genomic
locations were clustered together, such that the CIS with the smallest genomic “footprint”
was reported as the representative CIS. For highly significant CISs with narrow spatial
distributions of insertion sites, the 15K kernel is typically the scale on which CISs are
identified. Additional statistical analysis of insertion sites was performed using a Monte
Carlo framework10. CISs were compared to previously published datasets of human
pancreatic cancer genetics5,29,30.
Detection of Usp9x-T2/Onc fusion mRNA by RT-PCR in SB tumors

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen SB tumors using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen),
and total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity RNA-tocDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems). RT–PCR was carried out with a nested PCR approach
using primers of mouse Usp9x exon 1 and the Carp-β-Actin splice acceptor sequence of the
T2/Onc transposon cassette. cDNA was used as a template in a first round of PCR using
specific primers corresponding to exon 1 of Usp9x (5-gagtctgcgctgccgctgctg-3′) and Carp-βActin splice acceptor sequence (5′-cataccggctacgttgctaa-3′). The product of this reaction was
used as a template in a second round of nested PCR using an internal primer in the Usp9x
exon 1 (5′-gctgccgctgctgttgctgc-3′) and a second primer in the Carp-β-Actin splice acceptor
sequence (5′-acgttgctaacaaccagtgc-3′). PCR products were cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO
vector (Invitrogen) and positives clones sequenced.

(KCU1 and KCU2) mice as described previously34. Cells were subsequently cultured in
DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone). The normal human pancreatic
ductal cell line HPDE was generously provided by Dr. Tsao and cultured as described
previously35,36. The human pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC1 (CRL-1682) and BxPC3
(CRL-1687) were acquired from ATCC and cultured according to instructions. The other
cell lines were obtained from Clare Hall Laboratories (CRUK). The human cell lines Panc1,
MiaPaCa2, 818.4, Hs766T, PATU2, SUIT2, FA6 and MDA-Panc3 (PDA); CaCO2 and
SW1116 (colorectal cancer); SKBR3 (breast cancer) and A549 (lung cancer) were cultured
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The human cell lines U937 (histiocytic
lymphoma); RAMOS (Burkitt’s lymphoma); NCI-H2179 (lung cancer) and ZR75-1 (breast
cancer) were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were treated
with 1 μM trichostatin A (Sigma) for 24 hours or with 5 μM 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine
(Sigma) for 96 hours where indicated to obtain RNA and protein lysates to assess USP9x
expression. For anchorage-independent growth assay, cells were treated with 5 μM 5Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Sigma).
Retroviral infections

Phoenix cells were plated 24 hr before transfection using the ProFection Mammalian
Transfection System Calcium Phosphate (Promega). Target cells were infected with
retroviruses produced in the Phoenix packaging cells (24 and 48 hr after transfection) in the
presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) and were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma)
or 1 mg/ml G418 (Clontech). Experiments were performed using at least 2 independent cell
line infected pools. Human PDA cells lines Panc1, SUIT2 and PATU2 infected with
retroviral vectors expressed the Ecotropic Receptor (ecoR).

plated in duplicates in DMEM with 15% serum and 0.34% low–melting point agarose
(LMP, BioGene) onto 6-cm dishes coated with 0.5% LMP. Cells were fed twice a week and
grown for 2 weeks. For the anoikis assay, 105 cells/0.5 ml were plated in 24 well ultra low

105 cells/6 well plates for 24 hr to allow attachment, followed by treatment with human
TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) (RD Systems) for 24 hr. p21 induction was assessed after treatment with
human TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) (RD Systems) for 2 hr.
Real-time PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA from human PDA cell lines was extracted using the Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen),
and total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity RNA-tocDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). Human USP9x expression was analyzed by quantitative
PCR (q-PCR) using TaqMan gene expressiom assays Hs00245009_m1 (Applied
Biosystems) on a 7900HT Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression
was normalized to human β-ACTIN expression, assessed with the gene expression assays
Hs99999903_m1 (Applied Biosystems), and shown relative to control samples.
Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were washed three times in cold PBS and lysed with boiling lysis buffer (1% SDS;
10mM, pH 7.5 Tris; 50mM NaF; 1mM Na3VO4). Lysates were boiled 5 minutes, passed
through a 26 gauge needle to shear genomic DNA and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000
rpm. Equivalent amounts of protein were resolved in 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels
(Invitrogen), transferred to Immobilon–P Transfer Membranes (Millipore), and incubated
with the corresponding antibodies including anti-Ask1 (NB110-55482, Novus Biologicals);
anti-Mcl1 (5453, Cell Signaling); anti-Usp9x (A301-351A, Bethyl); anti-CC3 (9664, Cell
Signaling); anti-Itch (611198, BD); anti-p21 (sc-6246, Santa Cruz); anti-Smad4 (sc-7966,
Santa Cruz); anti-myc tag (2276, Cell Signaling); anti V5 tag (R960-25, Invitrogen); anti-cFLIP (ALX-804-127, Enzo Life Sciences); anti-c-Jun (9165, Cell Signalling); anti-p63
(Ab110038, Abcam); anti a-Tubulin (T6074, Sigma) and anti-Actin (sc-1616, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Reactive bands were visualized with ECL plus reagent (Amersham).
Relative expression was quantified with Image Quant TL software (GE Healthcare)
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) mouse tissues were cut into 3-μm tissue sections,
and antigen retrieval was performed in 10mM, pH 6.0 citric acid (for Usp9x and E-cadherin)
or 10mM, pH 8.0 EDTA (for Smad4). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched in 3%
H2O2/PBS for 20 minutes. Signal detection for immunohistochemistry was accomplished
with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using the
Elite Vectastain ABC kit and peroxidase substrate DAB kit (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). Primary antibodies used were anti-Usp9x, 1:200 (A301-351A, Bethyl); E-

counterstained with hematoxylin.
Clinical patient samples immunohistochemistry and analysis

Author Manuscript

Tissue microarrays (n=404) were prepared from patient samples obtained after appropriate
informed consent in Dresden (Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Dresden),
Regensburg (Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Regensburg) and Jena (Institute of
Pathology, University Hospital Jena). Informed consent was obtained for each patient,
following review by the human ethics committee Ethikkommission an der Technischen
Universität Dresden The PDA tumor samples were collected from 1993–2009, and the
majority of the patients (65%) did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. Those that did
undergo adjuvant therapy (35%) were chiefly treated with 5FU or gemcitabine-based
regimens, but in this subgroup there was no significant increase in patient survival. The
median survival times of patients following surgery from each center were indistinguishable.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 μm sections that were prepared using silanized
slides (Menzel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany). Staining was performed with the
Benchmark System (Ventana, Illkirch, France), using rabbit anti-USP9X antibody, 1:200
(A301-351A, Bethyl) and anti-ITCH, 1:200 (611198, BD); and the protocol UltraView
HRP, with the CC1 modified protocol as pretreatment. Slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin. Staining intensities were scored as absent (0), weak (1), medium (2) and strong
(3). For further analysis the staining intensities were grouped as negative (0) and positive
(1–3). The Cox regression model assumption of proportional hazard was tested using a plot
of the cumulative hazards function.

A second cohort of patient samples was obtained from the Gastrointestinal Cancer Rapid
Medical Donation Program in the Department of Pathology at Johns Hopkins Hospital,
USA. Use of all human tissue samples from resection specimens and autopsy participants
was approved by Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board, and obtained after informed
consent. All samples were collected within 12 hours postmortem and formalin fixed before
paraffin embedding. 5 μm sections were cut from matched primary and metastasis samples
onto glass slides. Slides were first incubated in Dako Target Retrieval Solution for antigen
retrieval. Slides were then incubated with rabbit anti-USP9X antibody, 1:1000 (ab26334,
Abcam) or 1:200 (NBP1-48321, Novus Bilogicals), and anti-SMAD4 as previously
described38. Signal detection for immunohistochemistry was accomplished with Dako
LSAB+System-HRP. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.

An additional cohort of pancreatic cancer resection samples was prospectively acquired
through the Australian Pancreatic Cancer Network and the Australian Pancreatic Cancer
Genome Initiative (http://www.pancreaticcancer.net.au/apgi). Consent was obtained for
genomic sequencing through the Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative (APGI) for
each individual patient following approval from Human Research Ethics Committees
(HREC) at participating sites (Sydney South West Area Health Service HREC Western
Zone, 2006/054; Sydney Local Health Network HREC RPA Zone, X11-0220 and North
Sydney Central Coast Health, Harbour HREC, 0612-251M). We extracted RNA from
tumour samples using the Qiagen Allprep® Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in accordance with

the manufacturer’s instructions, assayed for quality on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), and subsequently hybridized to Illumina Human HT-12 V4
microarrays. Raw idat files were processed using IlluminaGeneExpressionIdatReader
(Cowley et al. manuscript in preparation). Following array quality control, these data were
vs.t transformed, and then robust spline normalized, using the lumi R/Bioconductor package.
For the ICGC-APGI cohort, we assumed a proportional hazard: that the probability of death
is the same for those censored as for those remaining on study.

Author Manuscript

For the TMA and expression array cohorts, median survival was estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and the difference was tested using the log-rank test. P-values of less
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For the TMA cohort, as few parameters
were significant in univariate analysis, all were initially considered for Cox Proportional
Hazard multivariate analysis in a backward elimination model, and assessed with the
SPSS18 Software (IBM, Ehningen, Germany) with overall survival used as the primary
endpoint. For the ICGC-APGI cohort, clinico-pathologic variables analyzed with a P-value
of less than 0.25 on log-rank test were entered into Cox Proportional Hazard multivariate
analysis and the model was resolved using backward elimination. Statistical analysis was
performed using StatView 5.0 Software (Abacus Systems, Berkeley, CA, USA). Diseasespecific survival was used as the primary endpoint.
