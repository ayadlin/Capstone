BACKGROUND: Hypomethylating agents have demonstrated activity in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). Preclinical and single-arm trials have suggested that adding histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may synergize the epigenetic modulation of hypomethylating agents and improve treatment results. METHODS: The objective of this study
was to evaluate the possible benefit of adding valproic acid, an HDAC inhibitor, to decitabine in the treatment of MDS and AML.
RESULTS: Patients with higher risk MDS or with AML aged 60 years were eligible. Patients were randomized in a Bayesian
response-adaptive design to receive intravenous decitabine 20 mg/m2 daily for 5 days or decitabine plus oral valproic acid 50 mg/kg
daily for 7 days. Courses were repeated every 4 to 6 weeks. A maximum of 150 patients were to be treated. In total, 149 patients
were treated on study, including 87 patients with MDS and 62 patients with AML. The median patient age was 69 years (range, 20-89
years; 42% of patients were aged 70 years). Overall, 34% of patients achieved complete remission, and 55% had an objective
response. The median survival was 11.9 months, and the estimated 2-year survival rate was 27%. Outcome was not different with the
addition of valproic acid to decitabine versus decitabine alone in relation to the rates of complete remission, overall response, or survival. Subset analyses did not demonstrate a benefit within the MDS or AML categories. Toxicities—particularly neurotoxicities—were
higher with the combination arm. CONCLUSIONS: Adding valproic acid to decitabine was not associated with improved outcome in
the treatment of patients with MDS or elderly patients with AML. Future therapies may consider combining hypomethylating agents

INTRODUCTION
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by dysplastic changes in myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic progenitors. It is associated with cytopenias affecting 1 or more of
the 3 lineages. Patients may present with complications related to anemia, including fatigue, neutropenia with infections,
and thrombocytopenia and bleeding. In addition, variable expansions in blasts and, less commonly, leukocytosis are
observed. MDS may evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in approximately 50% of patients.1-3
Several risk classifications in MDS, based on morphology and percentage of bone marrow blasts, karyotype, degree
and number of cytopenias, and other features, predict prognosis in MDS. In general, the prognosis is poor, with a median
survival of 2 or 3 years from diagnosis. Patients with higher risk MDS usually have a higher percentage of bone marrow
blasts, poor-prognosis cytogenetics, and significant cytopenias.4-6 Standard therapy for MDS consists of hypomethylating
agent therapy with azacitidine or decitabine. These therapies improve the median survival in higher risk MDS from a median of 12 to 18 months to a median of 24 to 26 months.7-12
AML remains a highly fatal disease. With modern intensive chemotherapy regimens, approximately 60% of patients
achieve complete remission (CR), and 30% to 40% are cured. Prognosis depends on several factors, including patient age,
comorbid conditions, performance status, organ functions, leukemic cell karyotype, and molecular abnormalities. The
backbone of AML therapy is a regimen that includes cytarabine and anthracyclines.13,14

Decitabine 6 Valproic Acid in MDS-AML/Issa et al

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors modulate
epigenetics of cancer cells favorably to promote differentiation and apoptosis.15 Clinical experience with HDAC
inhibitors suggest modest response rates to such therapy
in both MDS and AML, with overall response rates that
range from 10% to 30%.16-18 Preclinical and clinical experience indicates synergy between hypomethylating
agents and HDAC inhibitors. In vitro models using HL60 and MOLT4 leukemic cells suggested that valproic
acid, an antiepileptic agent with HDAC-inhibitory
capacity, synergizes with decitabine in affecting growth
inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Those results led to
phase 1 and 2 studies of the combination, which demonstrated safe administration of azacitidine and decitabine
using oral valproic acid at doses up to 50 mg/kg daily for
10 days. That combination had significant activity in
patients with advanced, relapsed-refractory AML and
MDS.19,20 Similar safety profiles were reported by German investigators using a combination of valproic acid
and all trans-retinoic acid.16 Herein, we report our results
with a randomized study using a Bayesian responseadaptive design of decitabine therapy versus decitabine
plus valproic acid in patients with MDS and AML.

ing and pregnant women were excluded. Patients of
childbearing potential were required to practice effective
methods of contraception. Other exclusions were: active
and uncontrolled infection; uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses; and patients who required valproic acid treatment
continuously for seizure disorders control. All patients
signed informed consent according to institutional guidelines and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The protocol was approved by our institutional review
board.
Therapy

A Bayesian response-adaptive design was used to assign
patients to 1 of the 2 treatment arms: arm A, decitabine
20 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 days; or arm
B, decitabine at the same dose schedule with oral valproic
acid 50 mg/kg daily for 7 days (on days 1-7; simultaneous
therapy with decitabine). Patients received courses every 4 to
6 weeks, depending on persistence of disease, recovery of
counts, and recovery from toxicities of the prior course. Dose
modifications (reductions) for grade 3 and 4 toxicities were
allowed for decitabine (to 15 mg/m2, 10 mg/m2, 7.5 mg/m2,
and 5 mg/m2 daily) and oral valproic acid (to 40 mg/kg,
30 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg daily). Responding
patients were allowed to continue therapy for up to 3 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group and Therapy

Statistical Considerations

Patients who had MDS and >5% blasts or International
Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) intermediate-risk or
high-risk disease and patients with AML aged 60 years
were eligible. Patients were required not to have received
prior intensive chemotherapy or high-dose cytarabine
(>1 g/m2), or prior azacitidine for 3 cycles, or prior decitabine for 2 cycles. Prior biologic therapies, targeted
therapies, or single-agent chemotherapy were allowed.
Patients must have been off chemotherapy for at least 2
weeks before entering the study and must have recovered
from previous side effects unless they had evidence of rapidly progressive disease. Hydroxyurea was permitted to
control counts before study treatment. Growth factors,
including erythropoietin and granulocyte-colony–
stimulating factor, were allowed before and on study
according to institutional guidelines. Hydroxyurea was
allowed in the first 2 weeks of study treatment for rapidly
progressive disease. Patients were required to have a good
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 and adequate liver function (bilirubin <2 mg/dL), renal function (creatinine <2 mg/dL),
and cardiac function (patients with New York Heart Association cardiac class III-IV disease were excluded). Nurs-

Criteria for response were standard and as previously
reported by the International Working Group for MDS
and AML.21 An adaptive randomization design was used
to assign patients to treatment based on outcome. Patients
also were stratified according to their IPSS score. At first,
20 patients were assigned to each arm with equal assignment probability. Then, as efficacy data accumulated,
patient assignment to the 2 treatment arms became unbalanced in favor of the treatment that elicited the higher
mean of the outcome scores, as described below. For a
patient who died, the score would be the actual number of
weeks survived since the beginning of treatment. For a
patient who remained alive, the score would be the number of weeks survived since the beginning of treatment
plus an additional number, depending on the patient’s
current status. On the basis of the median survival in
weeks in the historic data, the numbers would be 40 for
patients who went off study for resistance, 60 for patients
without a response but who remained on study, 75 for
patients who achieved CR without platelet recovery
(CRp) or partial remission (PR), and 110 for patients who
achieved CR. A maximum of 150 patients were to be
accrued on study.22

RESULTS

In total, 149 patients have been treated. These included
87 patients with MDS and 62 patients with AML. The
median patient age was 69 years (range, 20-89 years), and
42% of patients were aged >70 years. Fifty-seven patients
(38%) were women. The characteristics of the study
group are detailed in Table 1.
Responses to therapy and outcomes for the total
study group are provided in Table 2. Overall, 51 patients
(34%) achieved CR, 22 patients (15%) had a bone marrow CR without full recovery of counts, 1 patient had a
PR with full count recovery, and 8 patients (5%) had hematologic improvement. The death rate in the first 2
months of therapy was low (7 patients; 5%). Overall, the
median survival was 11.9 months, and the estimated 2year survival rate was 27%.
Outcomes did not differ significantly with the addition of valproic acid to decitabine versus decitabine alone.
Among all patients treated, the CR rates for those who
received decitabine versus those who received decitabine
plus valproic acid were 31% versus 37% (P 5 .497), respectively; and the overall response rates were 51% versus 58%
(P 5 .407), respectively. The estimated median survival for
patients who received valproic acid plus decitabine versus
those who received decitabine alone was 11.2 months versus
11.9 months (P 5 .92), respectively; the estimated 2-year
survival rates were 30% versus 24%, respectively. Responses
and outcomes within the MDS and AML patient subsets
are illustrated in Figure 1A-C. Among the patients who

were treated for MDS, the respective CR rates for those who
received decitabine versus those who received decitabine
plus valproic acid were 29% versus 48% (P 5 .082), respectively; the overall response rates were 52% versus 68%
(P 5 .136), respectively; the estimated median survival was
16.9 months versus 14.9 months, respectively; and the estimated 2-year survival rates were 39% versus 25% (Fig. 1B),
respectively. Among the patients who were treated for
AML, the CR rates for those who received decitabine versus
those who received decitabine plus valproic acid were 33%
versus 9% (P 5 .029), respectively; the overall response rates
were 51% versus 35% (P 5 .208), respectively; the estimated median survival was 9.6 months versus 7.9 months
(P 5 .729), respectively; and the estimated 2-year survival
rates were 23% versus 22% (Fig. 1C), respectively.
Toxicity profiles for decitabine versus decitabine
plus valproic acid are detailed in Table 3. Neurotoxicity
was slightly more common in the combination arm, as
expected. However, other side effects were similar in the 2
treatment arms.
The median number of courses was 4 overall (range,
1-49 courses), 4 in the decitabine-alone arm (range, 1-49
courses), and 4 in the decitabine plus valproic acid combination arm (range, 1-30 courses). In the combination
arm, VPA was discontinued in 8 patients and reduced in
25 patients. Decitabine alone was continued when VPA
was discontinued in the combination arm. Decitabine was
held in 2 patients on the decitabine arm, and the decitabine dose was reduced in 1 patient. In the combination
arm, the decitabine dose was reduced in 5 patients.
Valproic acid levels were measured in 56 patients.
Outcomes of the patients who received valproic acid did
not differ according to valproic acid levels (data not
shown). In total, 13 patients underwent allogeneic stem
cell transplantation after this program, including 2 in the
decitabine arm and 11 in the combination arm.

DISCUSSION
Preclinical and pilot clinical experiences suggested the
potential benefit of adding HDAC inhibitors to hypomethylating agents as combination epigenetic therapy in myeloid malignancies. This led to our current trial evaluating
decitabine versus decitabine plus valproic acid in patients
with AML and MDS. Our results suggest no significant
benefit of adding valproic acid to decitabine in the setting
of MDS or AML. In patients with MDS, the addition of
valproic acid to decitabine resulted in an overall response
rate of 68% versus 52% with decitabine alone (P 5 .136);
and the median survival was 14.9 months versus 16.9
months (P 5 .57), respectively (Fig. 1B).
Although several single-arm trials have suggested a
potential benefit from adding HDAC inhibitors, the particular addition of valproic acid to decitabine in the current study did not produce encouraging results. Our
results are similar to those reported by the US Leukemia
Intergroup Trial E1905. In their phase 2 study of 149
patients with MDS (n 5 97) or AML (n 5 52) who were
randomized to receive azacitidine for 10 days with or
Cancer

without entinostat (an HDAC inhibitor), the addition of
entinostat did not improve overall response rates (range,
44%-46%) and was associated with a trend toward a
shorter median survival (13 months vs 18 months).23
The reason for these negative experiences may be
that, in the context of MDS, HDAC inhibitors do not
enhance epigenetic therapy favorably enough to improve
outcome. Another possibility is the use of a particularly
weak HDAC inhibitor. In this context, several newgeneration HDAC inhibitors may be more effective.
Quintas-Cardama et al reported that the use of pracinostat in combination with azacitidine in 9 patients with
MDS and failure on azacitidine therapy resulted in 8
responses, including 7 bone marrow CRs and 5 complete
cytogenetic responses.24 A third possibility is the scheduling of the hypomethylating agent and the HDAC inhibitor. In another study, Prebet and colleagues also used a
simultaneous combination of azacitidine and entinostat
and demonstrated less hypomethylation with the combination.23 The optimal schedule of the combination of
hypomethylating agents with HDAC inhibitors has not

been fully explored, and additional ongoing studies are
exploring the potential benefit of different sequences of
the combination (National Clinical Trial no.
NCT0l305499). Thus, in our particular study, the suboptimal results with the addition of valproic acid may have
been the result of an inferior scheduling regimen.
In summary, our experience with the addition of
valproic acid to decitabine did not produce an improved
outcome over decitabine alone in patients with MDS
and AML. Future investigations will evaluate potentially
better (new-generation) hypomethylating agents like
SGI-110, better HDAC inhibitors, and different scheduling regimens of epigenetic therapies, combining hypomethylating agents with other active agents in AML and
MDS, such as sapacitabine, clofarabine, omacetaxine,
onconova 1910, and growth factors (eltrombopag,
romiplostim).
