ABSTRACT
Objectives: A fluoropyrimidine plus cisplatin combined with surgery is standard
first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer. We evaluated the effect of pravastatin
on overall survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer in a prospective cohort
study.
Methods: At the time of surgery, we assigned 60 patients with advanced gastric
cancer (stage III or IV) to receive standard first-line treatment (control group)
or standard first-line treatment plus pravastatin at a dose of 40 mg once daily
(pravastatin group). The minimum follow-up period was 4 years and the maximum
of 6 years.
Results: The mean of age was 66 years and the TNM stage was III and IV in
65% and 35% of patients, respectively. There was no significant difference between
the two groups (control vs pravastatin) in median overall survival (15 vs 14 months;
P = 0.8). Predictors of survival were the stage (hazard ratio of death stage IV
(III stage as reference): 4.4; 95% CI: 2–9.7; p < 0.05) and older age (hazard ratio
of death ≥ 65 years (< 65 years as reference): 2.8; 95% CI: 1.3–6; p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Pravastatin did not improve outcome in patients with advanced
gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION

the time of diagnosis. In general, GC appears to be fairly
resistant to conventional chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil,
cisplatin, and irinotecan, among others) [2].
The role of statins in cancer therapy has been
reviewed previously elsewhere. A meta-analysis showed
a significant 32% reduction in GC risk with statin use
[3]. However, statin use did not improve recurrence-free
or overall survival after curative resection for stage II or
III gastric cancer in a matched case-control study [4]. In
this study, only patients who used statins for more than

Gastric cancer (GC) is a major cause of mortality
from cancer in the world, despite declining rates of
incidence in many industrialized countries. Overall, 5-year
survival from GC is lower than 30% [1]. One reason for the
poor prognosis is that the disease is usually quite advanced
by the time symptoms develop. Unfortunately, in Western
countries, about 75% of patients have cancer that has spread
to the perigastric lymph nodes or have distant metastases at

6 months had more favourable outcomes than non-users [4].
In mice models, atorvastatin has been shown to block MYC
phosphorylatin and activation, suppressing tumour initiation
and growth through a HMG-CoA reductase-dependent
pathway [5]. The antineoplastic effects of statins have also
been demonstrated in human GC cell lines through reduced
cell division on whole transcriptome microarrays. Lovastain
also induced upregulation of cell-cycle inhibitor p21 and
suppression of anti-apoptotic surviving and Mcl-1 proteins
in these GC cell lines [6]. Pravastatin is a potent inhibitor
of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
reductase inhibitor that has been shown to increase survival
in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma [7].
Published data indicate that statins can sensitize cancer cells
to chemical drugs such as cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil [8].
The objective was to assess the effect on survival of adding
treatment with pravastatin in a clinical sample of patients
with advanced GC.

compared to those with stage IV disease. Women and the
patients who received chemotherapy had a longer survival
with a certain trend toward significance statistical (Table 2).
There were no serious adverse events. Two patients
had muscle pain in the pravastatin group.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we found that pravastatin did
not significantly reduce the risk of death or recurrence
in patients with advanced gastric cancer. The factors
associated with an increase in survival were stage and
treatment with surgery or chemotherapy.
Various epidemiological studies have investigated
the association between statin use and the risk of gastric
cancer, three studies reporting a statistically nonsignificant
inverse association [9–11]. However, one study found that
ever-use of any statin was associated with significantly
lower gastric cancer risk (OR = 0.68) [12]. A systematic
review with meta-analysis of eleven studies (seven casecontrol, one cohort, three post-hoc analysis of 26 clinical
trials) evaluating the effect chemopreventive of statins on
GC risk showed as the use of statins was associated with
a 30% reduction in GC incidence [3]. Other meta-analysis
studying the effect of pravastatin therapy on cancer risk
did not provide evidence of a link between pravastatin
use and cancer risk, with overall rates of cancer of 7.4%
in the pravastatin group and 7.0% in the control group
[13]. However, the meta-regression analysis indicated
that age of study participants significantly modified the
association. The risk ratios of cancer associated with
pravastatin therapy were 0.99 and 1.22 for ages 60 and 75
respectively.
There are several different mechanisms by which
statins might decrease gastric cancer risk or increase
survival. One is a reduction in the synthesis of endogenous
mevalonate, a compound that is necessary for the
biosynthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoid derivates such
as farnesyl and geranylgeranyl residues. This depletes
mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol, leading to a
reduction in activity of the RAS protein, which is involved
in cell differentiation and proliferation [14]. Further,
intracellular cholesterol may also provide anticancer
effects, as rapidly dividing cancer cells require cholesterol
for synthesis of cell membranes [15]. A second mechanism
through which statins may interfere with carcinogenesis
involves reduced synthesis of mevalonic acid pathway
intermediates, such as isoprenoids. Isoprenoids are
important in the prenylation and activation of several
small GTP-ase cancer signalling pathways, including
Ras, Rac and Rho [16]. In vitro studies have shown that
the inhibition of isoprenoids is one of the mechanisms
mediating the effect of statins in cancer [17]. Third, there
is also evidence to suggest that statins trigger apoptosis of
gastrointestinal cancer cells, inhibit angiogenesis or target
mechanisms involved in the metastatic spread of cancer.

RESULTS
We recruited 60 patients, 38 men and 22 women,
with a mean age of 66 years (Table 1). The minimum
follow-up period for the living patients was 4 years and
the maximum of 6 years. Seventeen patients (28%) were
in stage IIIA, 22 (37%) in stage IIIB and 21 in stage IV.
Overall, 14 (23%) patients were classified as ASA III.
Table 1 summarises the characteristics of each
group. In the pravastatin group, a lower percentage of
patients were stage IV (20% vs. 42.5%) and were treated
surgically (90% vs 82.5%), while fewer patients were
treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Overall, patients in the pravastatin group had better
prognostic characteristics, although differences were not
statistically significant.
The cumulative probability of survival at 1 year
was 55% and 70% in the pravastatin and the control
groups respectively, while at 3 years it was 20% and 25%,
respectively. The median survival in the pravastatin group
was 14 months (95% CI: 5.2–22.7) compared to 15 months
(95% CI: 5.7–24.3) in the control group (p = 0.8) (Figure 1).
After adjusting the analysis by prognostic factors had not
significant differences between groups (Table 2).
We did not observe any differences in survival as a
function of age, sex, or ASA class (Table 2). Surgicallytreated patients had a longer survival than other groups
(18.8 vs 6.9 months; p = 0.05), as did those who received
chemotherapy (25.8 months vs 5.3 months; p < 0.000)
or radiotherapy (27.8 vs 7.1 months; p < 0.000). We also
found a linear trend in the median survival with stage,
median survival being 25.8 months in patients with stage
IIIA, 20.8 months in those with stage IIIB, and 6.9 months
in those with stage IV disease (p < 0.0001). The diseasefree survival was 9 months both for stages IIIA and IIIB.
The multivariate analysis showed longer survival in
patients under 65 years of age and in patients with stage III

Fourth, statins inhibited the growth of gastric cancer cells,
as well as the volume and weight of tumours in mice.
The levels of PCNA was much lower in the group treated
with statins [18]. Lastly, recently, it has been observed
that statins may also reduce plasma membrane fluidity,
particularly in cholesterol-rich rafts, thus interfering
with molecular interactions involved in cell signalling
emission. A mutated tumour-suppressor protein, p53, has
been found to upregulate the mevalonate pathway, an
observation that suggests that statins may help revert the
malignant phenotype of p53-mutated cancer cells [19].
The levels of ERK1/2, AKT and STAT3 proteins that
promote cancer progression were reduced by simvastatin,
a finding that correlated with a loss of cell viability and
with apoptosis [19].
Studies carried out in humans on the effect of
pravastatin on survival for some types of tumours have
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

indicated increased survival in advanced liver cancer,
acute myeloid leukaemia and non-serous-papillary
epithelial ovarian cancer [20–23]. However, as in our
study, other authors have found that pravastatin does not
increase overall survival in gastric cancer. Konings et al.
[24] assessed the efficacy of pravastatin (40 mg daily) in
30 patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma. The median
overall survival was 6 and 8 months in the control and
pravastatin group, respectively. These authors concluded
that the addition of pravastatin to chemotherapy did
not improve outcome in patients with advanced gastric
cancer. In contrast to the sample in the aforementioned
study, 65% of our patients were in stage III. Thereby,
retrospective studies have also found that patients who
underwent radical gastrectomy for stage II and III gastric
cancer and used statins for less than 6 months did not
have more favourable outcomes than non-users [4].

Only in patients with statin use of more than 6 months
was this drug associated with increased survival. In
that study, the type of statins was unspecified (various
statins having been prescribed) and the disease was
less advanced (stage II or III). The authors suggest that
long-term statin use has chemopreventive effects. Based
on these data we think that isn’t necessary to include
other clinical trials with pravastatin (40 mg once daily)
as a treatment associated in patients with advanced GC
(stages III or IV). We don’t know the effect of pravastatin
(40 mg once daily) to long-term in patients with stage I
or II, and also, if higher doses (80 mg or 120 mg daily)
will decrease mortality and recurrences in patients with
stage III or IV.
The differences between gastric cancer and other
tumours might be due to not all tumours responding
similarly to statins, and secondly, not all statins having
the same effect. For example, it has been hypothesized
than only lipophilic statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin,
lovastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin) can inhibit tumour
devlopment, while hydrophilic statins (rosuvastatin
and pravastatin) would be expected to promote tumour
development [21]. In a recent study, the addition of 40 mg
simvastatin to capecitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy in
patients with advanced gastric cancer did not increase
progression-free survival [25]. Thirdly, it may be that to
have an effect a higher dose would have been necessary.
The dose of pravastatin used for treating patients with
acute myeloid leukaemia was 1280 mg per day leukaemia
was 1280 mg per day [22]. Fourthly, some authors [26]
suggest that pravastatin may promote the development of
cancer by inducing mevalonate synthesis in extrahepatic
tissues. Fifth, chemotherapy may interact with the effect
of pravastatin.
Among the limitations of our research, we should
recognise the small number of patients included, and the
non-randomised nature of the study. However, we did
not observe any tendency towards a greater survival in
the pravastatin group, even though this group had better
prognostic characteristics, namely, a lower percentage of
patients having stage IV disease (20% vs 42.5%)
To summarise, pravastatin does not seem to improve
survival in patients with advanced cancer patients.

All patients received the treatment prescribed (surgery
and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and/or palliative
care) based on their stage and clinical situation. The
chemotherapy drugs used were cisplatin and 5 fluorouracil.
To participate in the trial, patients had to provide
written informed consent, to be older than 18 older,
and have histologically confirmed gastric cancer
(adenocarcinoma) for the first time and at an advanced
stage. Exclusion criteria included patients routinely (more
than 3 days a week) taking anti-inflammatory drugs or
aspirin; receiving oral anticoagulants, fibrates, cyclosporine
or oral contraceptives; having hypersensitivity to
pravastatin; pregnant women; lactation; having been
diagnosed in the previous 5 years with a tumour or diseases
with a prognosis of life less than two years.
All patients received the standard treatment (surgery
and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) for each of their
clinical conditions. The experimental group received one
tablet of 40 mg of pravastatin orally every 24 hours (at
breakfast). Patients were monitored every 3 months for
at least 2 years, this including laboratory tests. Every
6 months, an abdominal-pelvic CT scan was performed to
assess progression or if there was suspicion of progression
or cancer recurrence.
The ASA Classification applied was: I - a normal
healthy patient; II - a patient with mild systemic disease;
III - a patient with severe systemic disease and IV - a
patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant
threat to life.
The protocol was approved by an institutional
review board.

Statistical analysis
Continuous and categorical variables are presented as
medians with ranges and as frequencies with percentages,
respectively. Overall survival was estimated using the
Kaplan–Meier method. In univariate analysis, potential
factors associated with overall survival were explored using
the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards regression
model that included all baseline variables with a P value
of 0.05 or less for the between-group comparison was used
to perform an adjusted analysis of survival. The results are
summarized as hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and
P-values. All P values were two-sided, and P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a non-randomised prospective study
in clinical practice comparing the effect of pravastatin
on survival in patients with advanced GC. The cancer
stage was considered advanced in patients with T4 or N1
or M1 disease according to the fourth edition of TNM
classification. We included 60 patients admitted to the
Department of Surgery between December 2009 and June
2011. All of these patients underwent surgery, their stage
being confirmed following surgical. The last date of followup was in November 2015. A total of 20 of the patients
received pravastatin at a dose of 40 mg/day indefinitely.
