ABSTRACT:

Laboratory models show that the beta-blocker, propranolol, can inhibit
norepinephrine-induced breast cancer cell migration. We hypothesised that breast
cancer patients receiving beta-blockers for hypertension would show reduced
metastasis and improved clinical outcome. Three patient subgroups were identified
from the medical records of 466 consecutive female patients (median age 57, range
28-71) with operable breast cancer and follow-up (>10 years). Two subgroups
comprised 43 and 49 hypertensive patients treated with beta-blockers or other
antihypertensives respectively, prior to cancer diagnosis. 374 patients formed a nonhypertensive control group. Metastasis development, disease free interval, tumour
recurrence and hazards risk were statistically compared between groups. KaplanMeier plots were used to model survival and DM. Beta-blocker treated patients
showed a significant reduction in metastasis development (p=0.026), tumour
recurrence (p=0.001), and longer disease free interval (p=0.01). In addition, there
was a 57% reduced risk of metastasis (Hazards ratio=0.430; 95% CI=0.200-0.926,
p=0.031), and a 71% reduction in breast cancer mortality after 10 years (Hazards
ratio=0.291; 95% CI=0.119-0.715, p=0.007). This proof-of-principle study showed
beta-blocker therapy significantly reduces distant metastases, cancer recurrence,
and cancer-specific mortality in breast cancer patients suggesting a novel role for
beta-blocker therapy. A larger epidemiological study leading to randomised clinical
trials is needed for breast and other cancer types including colon, prostate and ovary.

INTRODUCTION

malignant cells from the primary tumour via lymphatic
or blood vessel routes with the process being tightly
regulated by exogenous cell signalling molecules,
including ligands to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
such as neurotransmitters and chemokines [9, 10]. In
previous in vitro cell migration studies we have shown
that the stress catecholamine hormone norepinephrine is
a potent inducer of migratory activity in carcinoma cell
lines of colon [11], prostate [12], ovarian cancer cells
[13] and breast [14] tissue origin, and this finding has
been confirmed in a mouse model [15]. Moreover, we
have shown that cell migration is mediated by adrenergic

Although an estimated 38,000 [1] patients are
diagnosed with breast cancer in the US each year death
rates are declining in part due to adjuvant therapies
including the use of ER-antagonists and anti-HER2
(trastuzumab) therapy [2-4]. Nonetheless, approximately
30% of treated BC patients develop distant metastases
[5] and these significantly account for 90% of breast
cancer deaths [6]. Consequently, therapeutic strategies are
needed that target metastasis [7, 8].

receptors (AR) and that the process is inhibited by
the beta-blocker adrenergic receptor antagonist drug
propranolol which is non-selective for β1AR and β2AR
[11, 12, 15]. Additional support for the therapeutic benefit
of beta-blockers is provided by recent studies showing
propranolol can reduce proliferation in human pancreatic
cell lines [16, 17].
Beta-blocker drugs along with ACE-inhibitors,
calcium channel antagonists, imidazoline receptor
antagonists, and diuretics are clinically well characterized
for the therapeutic treatment of hypertension and are
proven in reducing life-threatening cerebrovascular events
[18, 19]. Epidemiologic studies confirm that beta-blocker
treatment per se has no effect in causing or promoting
cancer growth giving reassurance for their continued
clinical use [20, 21].
In the present study we hypothesised that patients
started on and maintained with antihypertensive betablocker therapy prior to their breast cancer diagnosis would
show reduced distant metastasis formation compared to
non-hypertensive breast cancer patients or those treated
with other antihypertensive drugs.

in this study and their characteristics are shown in Tables
1a-d. A total of 92 (19.7%) patients had hypertension
diagnosed prior to breast cancer diagnosis and were
therapeutically treated using a range of antihypertensives
including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, Ca2+ antagonists,
imidazoline receptor antagonists or diuretics (Table 2). In
particular, 43/92 (46.7%) of this hypertensive subgroup
(median age 57 years, range 39-69) received beta-blocker
drugs while the remaining 49/92 (53.3%) patients received
other antihypertensive drugs. The latter group significantly
differed in showing increased median age of 62 years
(range 47-70) compared to the non-hypertensive patient
subgroup whose median age was 54.5 years (range 28-71).
In addition, the non-beta-blocker treated antihypertensive
subgroup contained an increased proportion of postmenopausal patients (Table 1c) Otherwise, no significant
difference was seen in tumour stage, tumour size, grade,
type, vascular invasion, Nottingham Prognostic Index
(NPI) or AT between the three patient subgroups.
Patients receiving beta-blockers showed a significant
reduction in formation of distant metastasis (χ2=4.986,
p=0.026) and tumour recurrence (χ2=13.091, p=0.001)
compared to non-hypertensive BC control patients (Table
3).

(Fig 1a) and longer breast cancer specific survival
(LR=6.479, p=0.011) (Fig 1b), and longer disease free
interval (LR=6.658, p=0.011) when compared to nontreated breast cancer patients.

Tumour metastasis is a complex process and
is associated with generally poor clinical outcome.
Therapeutic strategies are needed that can prevent its
occurrence, thereby prolonging patient life. The present
study was performed to validate the putative role of betablocker adrenergic receptor antagonists in retarding the
progress of breast cancer disease by reducing metastasis
formation. We performed an epidemiological study of
breast cancer patients with long term clinical follow
up (>10 years) and showed that patients receiving
antihypertensive beta-blocker drugs significantly benefit
by a 57% reduction in distant metastasis formation and a
71% reduced risk of dying from breast cancer compared
to control patients.
It is increasingly being recognised that stress can
promote cancer progression through an indirect effect
on the immune system [22]. Moreover, a biological
mechanism of action has been proposed for the involvement
of catecholamine stress hormones. It has been shown
that norepinephrine can directly stimulate tumour cell
migration and this effect is mediated by the beta-adrenergic
receptor, β2AR. High levels of β2AR have been reported
in human cell lines [11, 23, 24] and tumour samples [25]
and importantly, we have shown that cell migration in a
number of cancer models is inhibited by the beta-blocker
adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol [11, 12, 14].

Multivariate analysis:
A multivariate Cox hazard model was used to
determine the hazard ratio (HR) for predicting breast
cancer specific survival and distant metastasis risk in
patients receiving beta-blocker treatment compared to
other significant breast cancer variables including tumour
size, stage and grade. Patients receiving beta-blocker
treatment had a 71% reduced risk of cancer-associated
mortality (HR=0.291, CI= 0.119-0.715, p=0.007). In
addition, beta-blocker treated patients showed a 57% risk
reduction in developing distant metastasis (HR=0.430,
CI= 0.200-0.926, p=0.031; Table 4) compared to nontreated breast cancer patients.

The aim of the current study was to translate these
findings into a clinical setting by testing the hypothesis
that breast cancer patients receiving beta-blockers for preexisting hypertension would show a significant reduction
in tumour metastasis with a consequent reduction in
mortality.
In line with expectations, antihypertensive drug
treatment was more frequently prescribed in older postmenopausal patients with no significant difference seen
between the beta-blocker and other antihypertensive
treatment subgroups. The beta-blocker treated subgroup
was shown to have significantly (57%) reduced risk of
developing distant metastasis and tumour recurrence
compared to patients receiving either no, or other types
of, antihypertensive drugs. As a consequence of this, betablocker treated patients showed a significant increase
in breast cancer specific survival and increased disease
free interval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report highlighting the in vivo therapeutic benefits
of beta-blockers in breast cancer patients, supporting the
biological mechanism of norepinephrine-induced cell
migration mediated by adrenergic receptor activation as
shown in cell lines and animal models. These findings
support recent epidemiological cancer studies that have

shown adrenoceptor antagonists have the potential for
providing a novel clinically effective therapeutic strategy
in treating several different cancer types. Beta-blockers
have been shown to reduce the incidence of endocrineregulated prostate cancer [26], but this beneficial effect
is not just limited to inhibition of beta receptors because
patients receiving alpha antagonists also show a reduced
incidence of prostate [27] and bladder [28] cancer.
Moreover, a generalised reduction in all cancer types has
been reported in beta-blocker treated patients [29].

leading onto a randomised controlled clinical trial. The
latter would determine a) If beta-blocker drugs can be
used as a prophylactic for metastatic formation in breast
cancer, b) The optimal adjuvant therapy dosage in breast
cancer, c) Whether beta-blocker treatment is effective in
clinically treating patients with other types of cancer, e.g.
prostate, pancreatic and colonic cancer, suggested by our
cell line models.

Future studies

Study limitations

The current study suggests that adrenoceptor
antagonists have the potential for retarding breast cancer
progression and improving clinical outcome. Additional
studies are needed to assess the protein expression of
adrenoceptors in breast and other cancer types to test if
they can be used as prognostic and predictive biomarkers
in determining clinical outcome and likely response to
antagonist treatment.

Several limitations apply to our epidemiological
study including patient population size and factors that
were not controlled for in using an existing patient dataset.
In mitigation, the beta-blocker and other hypertensivetreated cohort were of approximately the same size and
together accounted for approximately 20% of the total
patient cohort. In addition, all patient subgroups were
evenly matched for adjuvant therapy and age making it
