ABSTRACT
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with known multiple functions
in immune regulation, inflammation, and oncogenesis. Binding of IL-6 to the IL-6
receptor (IL-6R) induces homodimerization and recruitment of glycoprotein 130
(gp130), which leads to activation of downstream signaling. Emerging evidence
suggests that high levels of IL-6 are correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer
patients. IL-6 appears to play a critical role in the growth and metastasis of breast
cancer cells, renewal of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), and drug resistance of
BCSCs, making anti-IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 therapies promising options for the treatment
and prevention of breast cancers. However, preclinical and clinical studies of the
applications of anti-IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 therapy in breast cancers are limited. In this
review, we summarize the structures, preclinical and clinical studies, mechanisms
of action of chemical and biological blockers that directly bind to IL-6, IL-6R, or
gp130, and the potential clinical applications of these pharmacological agents as
breast cancer therapies.

INTRODUCTION

events [19] (Figure 1). Classic-signaling is limited to a
few cell types since membrane IL-6R is only expressed on
hepatocytes and immune cells. In contrast, sIL-6R, which
is generated by alternative splicing and/or proteolysis, can
bind to IL-6 and elicit trans-signaling in all cells due to
ubiquitous expression of membrane gp130 [20-22]. IL-6
plays an important role in immune responses and repair
processes through classic-signaling, and may be involved
in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and cancers
through trans-signaling. However, the full range of
biological functions of IL-6 mediated by classic and transsignaling remains to be elucidated [23].
Emerging evidence shows that IL-6 plays critical
roles in cancer development, progression and metastasis
by regulating the tumor microenvironment and cancer
stem cells [7]. Because of this, the IL-6/IL-6R/GP130
signaling pathway represents an attractive target for
therapeutic or preventive intervention. The application of
IL-6 blockers as anticancer agents has been investigated

Recent studies have demonstrated that the
proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an
important role in tumor progression and metastasis [115]. IL-6 is a 23- to 30-kDa pleiotropic cytokine that is
produced by various types of cells, including immune
cells, fibroblasts, and certain tumor cells [13, 16, 17].
Upon binding of IL-6 to IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), the IL-6/
IL-6R complex recruits glycoprotein 130 (gp130) to
form a hexameric IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex composed
of two IL-6, two IL-6R, and two gp130 subunits that
initiate downstream signaling [13, 16-18] (Figure 1). This
IL-6 signaling via the membrane IL-6R and gp130 has
been termed classic-signaling. An alternative to classicsignaling has recently been described, termed transsignaling, in which a complex is formed between IL-6
and a soluble form of IL-6R, sIL-6R, which then joining
with membrane gp130 to generate downstream signaling

in many cancer types, including lung cancer, multiple
myeloma, B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, prostate
cancer, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and also
in oral mucositis in head and neck cancer, and cachexia
related to lung cancer [13]. Presently, however, only two
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), tocilizumab (anti–IL-6R)
and siltuximab (anti–IL-6), have been approved in the
US for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
Castleman’s disease respectively, but not for cancer. In
this review, we evaluate the evidence regarding potential
use of IL-6 antagonists for breast cancer therapy and
prevention.

resistance to multi-drug chemotherapy [37]. Very recently,
IL-6 has been suggested as a major factor influencing
resistance to trastuzumab, a therapeutic HER2 antibody,
in breast cancer [38]. Trastuzumab resistance in HER2overexpressing breast cancer cells is shown to be mediated
by the IL-6 inflammatory loop, leading to expansion of
the breast cancer stem cell population [38]. Blockade of
this IL-6 loop by an IL-6 antagonist, tocilizumab, reduced
the cancer stem cell population, resulting in decreased
tumor growth and metastasis in mouse xenografts [38].
Further studies are warranted to assess the potential of
utilization of HER2 therapies in combination with IL-6
therapies to overcome drug resistance in HER2-positive
breast cancers.
Triple-negative breast cancer, one of the
most aggressive forms of the disease, accounts for
approximately 10-20% of breast cancer cases [29, 39].
In comparison to other breast subtypes, triple-negative
breast cancer cell lines secret the highest levels of IL-6
[40]. Triple negative breast cancers rely on the autocrine
expression of IL-6 for growth [40]. Studies have shown
that inhibition of IL-6 expression by shRNA in triplenegative breast cancer cells can lead to the suppression
of colony formation and decreased cell survival in vitro
as well as decreased tumor engraftment and growth in
vivo [40]. Induction of IL-6 production by the adipokine
leptin in breast cancer amplifies STAT3 signaling, and
phosphorylation of STAT3 is significantly reduced by IL-6
neutralizing antibodies [41]. With limited therapy options
for aggressive triple-negative breast cancer, IL-6 signaling
inhibitors may offer an important new therapeutic option.
IL-6 signaling not only exerts its effects on breast
cancer cells, but can also play a role in the surrounding
tumor microenvironment, indirectly impacting cancer
growth and progression [42]. The tumor microenvironment
is composed of various cell types including mesenchymal
stem cells, adipocytes, tumor-associated fibroblasts,
endothelial cells, and immune cells, all of which are
capable of interaction with tumor cells via cytokine
networks [43]. Both autocrine and paracrine actions of
IL-6 in the tumor microenvironment are reported to be
critical for breast oncogenesis [6, 43]. IL-6 produced
by tissue-specific fibroblasts promotes the growth and
invasion of breast cancer cells through STAT3-dependent
up-regulation of Notch-3, Jagged-1, and carbonic
anhydrase IX [44, 45]. STAT3 phosphorylation in breast
epithelial cells can be stimulated by paracrine signaling
through IL-6 from both breast cancer cells and fibroblasts
[46]. IL-6 secreted from senescent mesenchymal stem
cells can increase the proliferation and migration of breast
cancer cells by induction of STAT3 phosphorylation
[14]. Utilizing IL-6 signaling inhibitors to target the
tumor microenvironment and indirectly block cancer cell
growth could be effective in treating and preventing breast
carcinogenesis.

THE ROLE OF IL-6 IN BREAST CANCER
DEVELOPMENT
IL-6 is expressed in approximately 50% of breast
cancers [24]. Increasing evidence supports the notion
that high levels of serum IL-6 are associated with poor
prognosis, advanced disease, and metastases in breast
cancer patients [6, 13, 25-28]. Breast cancer is commonly
classified by receptor expression and can be categorized
into estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2-positive, or
triple-negative breast cancer [29]. The three breast cancer
subtypes rely on IL-6 signaling to varying degrees.
Approximately 75% of breast cancer cases are ER+
[30]. ER+ breast cancer can be successfully treated with
selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen,
but drug resistance eventually occurs in most patients [31].
ER+ breast cancer patients tend to have lower than average
serum levels of sIL-6R when compared to ER- breast
cancer patients [32]. Patients with above average serum
levels of sIL-6R are more likely to experience recurrence
compared to patients with lower levels of sIL-6R [32]. The
transcription factor HOXB13 enhances progression and
recurrence of breast cancer by down-regulation of ERα and
up-regulation of IL-6 expression [31]. IL-6 treatment of
the estrogen receptor-expressing cell line, MCF-7, showed
a Notch-3 dependent up-regulation of the Notch ligand,
Jagged-1, and the carbonic anhydrase IX [33]. IL-6 also
promoted a hypoxia-resistant and invasive phenotype in
MCF-7 cells [33]. Secretion of IL-6 by cancer-associated
fibroblasts has also been implicated in the suppression of
ERα and tamoxifen resistance in luminal breast cancer
cell lines [34]. Therefore, combination therapy with ER
antagonists and IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 inhibitors may provide
a novel therapeutic strategy for ER+ breast cancers.
The HER2 gene is amplified in approximately
25-30% of breast cancer cases [35]. IL-6 is elevated in
HER2-positive breast cancer where IL-6 activated STAT3
and induced an autocrine loop of IL-6/STAT3 expression
[36]. Further evidence revealed that the growth of HER2positive breast cancer in vivo was dependent on the HER2/
IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway [36]. Drug resistance is a
critical problem in breast cancer therapy, and autocrine
production of IL-6 by breast tumor cells promotes

immunogenicity [61]. Sirukumab has been studied in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), and cutaneous lupus erythematosus
[13]. Clinical efficacy of sirukumab was evaluated
in a phase II study of patients with active RA failing
methotrexate monotherapy and showed improvements
in the symptoms of RA [62]. Due to desirable PK/PD
characteristics, sirukumab would be a prime candidate
for testing in breast cancer. Sirukumab is a human
mAb, and therefore it has an advantage of a very low
immunogenicity in anti-cancer therapies.

There are four potential extracellular targets to
antagonize IL-6 signaling, IL-6 itself, IL-6R, gp130,
and/or IL-6/sIL-6R complex. Recently developed IL-6
targeting agents include chimeric, humanized or human
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), avimers, and small
molecules (Figure 2). Currently available IL-6/IL-6R/
gp130 blockers are summarized in Table 1, and are
discussed in detail in this section.

Johnson & Johnson (J&J)

Olokizumab (CP6038); UCB
Olokizumab, a humanized anti–IL-6 mAb, has been
studied in patients with RA [13]. Crystal structure data
have revealed that binding of olokizumab to site 3 (the
gp130 binding site) on IL-6 induces a conformational
change in IL-6 and neutralizes its biological activity
by blocking receptor hexamer complex formation
[63]. A phase I pharmacokinetic and safety study in
healthy subjects was performed and showed no serious
adverse events and rapid decreases in C-reactive protein
concentration [64]. On the basis of the pathogenetic role
of IL-6 in cancers, a study of the anti-cancer activity of
olokizumab appears warranted.

Siltuximab (CNTO 328) is a chimeric anti–IL-6
mAb that has recently been approved for multicentric
Castleman’s disease, a rare B-cell lymphoproliferative
disorder [47]. Siltuximab has been shown to be potentially
effective in the treatment of various cancers as a single
agent or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs
[48-56]. In preclinical studies, siltuximab inhibited IL-6–
induced activation of ovarian cancer cells [49], inhibited
IL-6–induced survival of advanced prostate cancer [57],
suppressed lung cancer growth in mouse xenograft
models [55], and enhanced melphalan cytotoxicity in a
preclinical multiple myeloma model [51]. A case report
showed that complete remission was achieved in a
patient with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma after
single agent therapy with siltuximab [58]. Clinical trials
of siltuximab for development as a drug for smoldering
multiple myeloma are ongoing; however, its development
for advanced multiple myeloma, hormone-refractory
prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
and renal cancer has been discontinued due to lack of
efficacy in clinical trials [53]. The addition of siltuximab
to bortezomib did not result in improved outcome in
patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
[59]. Lack of anti-multiple myeloma effect of siltuximab
in clinical trials could be explained by emergence of IL6-independent subclones or substitution for IL-6 by other
IL-6 family cytokines that utilize gp130 as a shared signal
transducer [60]. To date, no preclinical or clinical data are
available for breast cancer therapy; however, the safety
and efficacy profile of siltuximab is well established,
making it ideal for future studies.

mAb 1339 is a fully human version of murine mAb
B-E8 (Elsilimomab) directed against human IL-6 [65].
mAb 1339 inhibited the growth of multiple myeloma in
vitro, and synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic activity
of dexamethasone in vivo in a SCID-hu mouse model of
multiple myeloma [66]. Given its inhibitory role against
multiple myeloma, mAb 1339 may have potential activity
against other types of cancer, including breast cancer.

Clazakizumab (BMS945429, ALD518); BristolMyers Squibb/Alder Biopharmaceuticals
The safety and efficacy of the humanized anti–IL-6
mAb clazakizumab was evaluated in a phase II clinical
trial in patients with active RA [67] and a phase I/II clinical
trial in patients with glucocorticoid-refractory acute graft
versus host disease (NCT01530256). For cancer therapy,
clazakizumab was evaluated for the treatment of non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-related fatigue and cachexia
and oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer
[13, 68]. In preclinical and clinical trials, clazakizumab
ameliorated NSCLC-related anemia and cachexia [68]. No
preclinical or clinical data are currently available for the
activity of clazakizumab against breast cancer.

Avimers are created from a large family of human
extracellular receptor domains by exon shuffling and
phage display to generate multidomain proteins with
binding properties that may overcome the limitations of
mAbs [69]. C326 is composed of an IL-6–binding trimer
and a IgG-binding domain, resulting in a heterotetrameric
avimer with very high affinity for IL-6 and in vivo
neutralizing activity. A phase 1 clinical study of the safety
and biological effects of C326 in Crohn’s disease is
ongoing (NCT00353756).

Soluble gp130 (sgp130) is a natural antagonist
selective for IL-6 trans-signaling, which is found in serum
and binds to IL-6/sIL-6R complex without affinity for
IL-6 or IL-6R alone [22]. A current IL-6/sIL-6R targeted
molecule under study is soluble gp130 linked to IgGFc (sgp130Fc) (Figure 2). Soluble gp130Fc (sgp130Fc)
showed competitive inhibition of IL-6/sIL-6R–
induced trans-signaling [71]. Treatment with sgp130Fc
significantly reduced colitis-associated premalignant
cancer in mice [72]. Because of its specific blockade
of proinflammatory trans-signaling [23], sgp130Fc has
potential as an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for
breast cancer.

membrane IL-6R recruits gp130 to form an IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 hexamer complex. In trans-signaling, proteolysis and/or alternative splicing
generates soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R), which binds to IL-6 and can stimulate gp130-expressing cells. Both classic and trans-signaling
pathways activate downstream signaling including JAK-STAT, SHP-2-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2, and PI3K-AKT, leading to the transcription

cancer [74]. MR16-1 inhibited fibrosarcoma growth in
vivo [75]. MR16-1 treatment enhanced antitumor activity
through the elimination of myeloid-derived suppressor
cells and enhancement of CD8+ and CD4+ cell responses
[75, 76]. Recent reports showed anti-cancer effects
of tocilizumab in a colon cancer xenograft model [9]
and the effects of combination therapy of tocilizumab
and interferon-alpha against renal cell carcinoma [77].
Tocilizumab also inhibited tumor growth of trastuzumab
resistant breast cancer cells [38]. However, so far no
clinical study has been reported in breast cancer.

Structures of current IL-6R targeting molecules
include humanized or human mAbs, bi-specific
nanobody, single chain Fv (scFv) linked to IgG-fragment
crystallizable (Fc), IL-6 mutants, and small molecules
(Figure 2). Generally, it has been shown that clinical
efficacy as well as safety profiles among anti-IL-6 and
anti-IL-6R mAbs appear similar in RA patients [73].
Currently available IL-6R blockers are discussed in this
section and summarized in Table 1.

Tocilizumab (Actemra, RoActemra); Roche/
Chugai

Sarilumab (REGN88, SAR153191); Regeneron/
Sanofi-Aventis

Tocilizumab, a humanized anti–IL-6R mAb that
blocks both soluble IL-6R and membrane-bound IL-6R,
has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of RA and
shown to be an effective therapy for other inflammatory
diseases, including Castleman’s disease [13]. MR16-1, a
rodent analog of tocilizumab, exhibited a dramatic effect

Sarilumab, a human anti–IL-6R mAb, is under
clinical trial for RA and ankylosing spondylitis [13]. The
results of a phase II study to assess the safety and efficacy
of sarilumab in active RA patients have been reported
[73]. Sarilumab showed efficacy in patients with active RA

Figure 2: Potential targets for inhibiting IL-6-induced inflammation and tumorigenesis by IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 blockers.
IL-6 inhibitors, such as anti-IL-6 mAbs and anti-IL-6 avimers, block the binding of IL-6 to both membrane IL-6R and extracellular sIL6R. IL-6R inhibitors, including anti-IL-6R mAb, anti-IL-6R scFv, and anti-IL-6R nanobody can bind to IL-6R and inhibit both classic and
trans-signaling. Soluble form of gp130 Fc fusion protein (sgp130Fc) is a decoy antagonist of IL-6 trans-signaling via binding to the IL-6/
sIL-6R complex. Anti-gp130 mAb and anti-gp130 chemical compounds bind to gp130 and inhibit IL-6-induced gp130 dimerization and
signaling.

compared to placebo [73]. For cancer therapy, inhibition
of the growth of xenograft tumors of DU145 (prostate),
Calu3 (lung), and A549 (lung) cells by sarilumab was
reported both as a single agent and in combination with the
VEGF blocker aflibercept [78]. The potential of sarilumab
in cancer inhibition has been demonstrated, however,
its effects in breast cancer are unknown and should be
investigated.

ERBA (20S,21-epoxy-resibufogenin-3-acetate) is
another small molecule with IL-6R–antagonist activity
that suppresses the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R. Although
evidence of direct interaction between ERBA and IL-6/
IL-6R is lacking, ERBA specifically suppressed IL-6
activities and alleviated cancer cachexia [87].

ALX-0061 (nanobody); Ablynx/AbbVie

DIRECT GP130 BINDING ANTAGONISTS

ALX-0061 is a bi-specific nanobody that targets IL6R and serum albumin [23]. Its small size (26 kD) should
allow ALX-0061 to penetrate more effectively into tissues
[79]. A phase I/II study of ALX-0061 was completed in
February 2013, and demonstrated strong efficacy and
safety in patients with moderate to severely active RA on a
stable background dose of methotrexate (NCT01284569).

Although increasing attention has recently been
paid to the role of gp130 in cancer, no pharmaceutical
company-driven anti-gp130 agents are currently under
development. Anti-gp130 mouse mAbs and some chemical
small molecules have been reported (Figure 2). However,
mouse mAbs are not eligible for human clinical studies
and some small molecule inhibitors have not been studied
in cancer. Most recently, direct binding of a novel small
molecule inhibitor to gp130 has been demonstrated [88].
gp130 antagonists could be a new effective class of drugs
which target IL-6 signaling to treat cancer.

NRI; Osaka University, Japan
NRI is an anti–IL-6R single chain Fv (scFv) of
tocilizumab fused to IgG1 fragment crystallizable (Fc).
Injection of an adenovirus vector encoding NRI exhibited
inhibitory effects on multiple myeloma cells (S6B45)
in vivo [80]. This study showed a sustained therapeutic
concentration of NRI in the circulation and inhibitory
activity comparable to that of the parent agent tocilizumab.

B-R3 and B-P4; CHRU Angers
B-R3 is a mouse mAb against gp130 that has been
used in preclinical studies to inhibit gp130 signaling [22,
89]. Another anti-gp130 mAb, B-P4, blocked gp130induced STAT3 phosphorylation in hepatic adenomas [90].
No clinical trials are underway with anti-gp130 mAbs yet.

SANT-7; Institute of Research in Molecular
Biology (IRBM)

Madindoline A (MDL-A); Kitasato University,
Japan

SANT-7 is a rationally designed mutant of IL-6 and
a super-antagonist of IL-6 [81]. SANT-7 showed activity
against multiple myeloma in vitro and in vivo [82, 83].
Combination therapy with SANT-7 and dexamethasone
or all-trans-retinoic acid showed activity against multiple
myeloma in a SCID-hu in vivo model and in cell lines
[84, 85].

MDL-A is a non-peptide antagonist of gp130 that
shows IL-6/IL-6R blocking properties [91]. MDL-A
suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by IL-6 or IL-11
in vitro [91]. MDL-A binds to the extracellular domain
of gp130 [92]. MDL-A analogues were synthesized
and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against IL-6–
dependent cell proliferation [93]. Several MDL-A
analogues were identified as candidates for future
development of IL-6-targeting inhibitors [93]. To date,
no preclinical or clinical data are available for its activity
against breast cancer.

ERBF; Kitasato University, Japan
ERBF (20S,21-epoxy-resibufogenin-3-formate)
is a small molecule with IL-6R–antagonist activity
that suppresses the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R. Although
evidence of direct interaction between ERBF and IL-6/
IL-6R has not been demonstrated, ERBF suppressed IL-6–
induced neuronal differentiation and osteoclast formation
[86]. The anti-differentiation potential of ERBF suggests
that it could be utilized in anticancer therapies.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

SC144; University of Southern California
SC144 is a small-molecule gp130 inhibitor
that suppresses STAT3 signaling via induction of
gp130 phosphorylation and down-regulation of gp130
glycosylation [94]. SC144 inhibited tumor growth of
human ovarian cancer xenografts and reduced the number
of tumor blood vessels [94]. Evidence of direct interaction

between SC144 and gp130 was provided by drug affinity
responsive target stability (DARTS) assay [94], and to
date, no preclinical or clinical data are available for breast
cancer therapy.

bazedoxifene [97], however further studies with these
agents are necessary to determine whether their key action
is through direct interaction with gp130.
Although IL-6 targeting therapies have shown
promising outcomes in inflammatory diseases and some
types of cancers, safety issues related to IL-6 targeting
approaches have been reported [23]. Adverse events
associated with inhibition of IL-6 signaling include
susceptibility to infection, cardiovascular toxicity, and
gastrointestinal perforation [23]. Understanding the basic
biology of IL-6, as well as large-scale and long-term
clinical trials of new blocking agents of IL-6 signaling,
will be important to reduce these risks.
Anti–IL-6 mAbs have achieved great commercial
success to date, however, mAb biologics have some
limitations in their clinical utility [79]. First, the production
process is labor intensive and costly because of the
complex molecular structure of mAbs. Second, invasive
routes of administration are required. Third, penetration
and accumulation of mAbs in tissues, including solid
tumors and bone marrow, and accessibility to some
epitopes on certain proteins, can be problematic due to
their large size. Fourth, the instability of mAbs necessitates
storage under refrigeration. Finally, the immunogenicity
of some mAbs can abolish their effectiveness [98]. Other
protein scaffolds, such as avimers and nanobodies with
improved affinity and accessibility respectively, have been
developed to overcome some of the limitations of mAbs
[79]. Nevertheless, small molecule-based anti-IL-6/IL-6R/
gp130 agents offer distinct advantages and could provide
more versatility and flexibility as therapeutics.

Raloxifene (Keoxifene, LY156758, Evista);
Eli Lilly and bazedoxifene (Viviant); Wyeth
Pharmaceuticals
The selective estrogen receptor modulators
(SERMs), raloxifene and bazedoxifene, are used
clinically to treat or prevent ER+ invasive breast cancer
and osteoporosis [95, 96]. Recently, raloxifene and
bazedoxifene were discovered to be inhibitors of the IL-6/
gp130 interface [97]. The interaction of these drugs with
gp130 was demonstrated indirectly via docking studies
and a drug affinity responsive target stability assay. Both
agents inhibited IL-6–induced STAT3 phosphorylation
in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 [97]. To date,
no clinical data are available for breast cancer therapy.
However, these SERMs may have potential effects
against breast cancer via IL-6 signaling in addition to ERmodulating mechanisms.

LMT-28; The Catholic University of Korea and
Korea University, South Korea
A novel synthetic compound, LMT-28 [(4R)-3((2S,3S)-3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-methylenenonanoyl)4-isopropyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one], has been shown
to bind directly and specifically to gp130, and thereby
inhibits the binding and signaling of IL-6 and soluble
complex of IL-6/IL-6R [88]. Oral administration of
LMT-28 ameliorated collagen-induced arthritis and acute
pancreatitis in mice. This compound possesses a potential
to be used as an anti-cancer agent, targeting gp130 and is
now being studied for anti-breast cancer activity.

CONCLUSIONS
Interventions against the IL-6/IL-6R/gp130
signaling axis appear to be quite effective for some
inflammatory diseases. At present, the application of IL-6/
IL-6R/gp130 blockers as anti-cancer agents has not been
studied broadly, and to an even lesser extent for breast
cancer. However, considering the clinical development of
several IL-6-based anticancer drugs, their application in
oncology is likely to expand in the near future. Because
of the reliance of disease progression on a variety of
IL-6–related mechanisms in breast cancer, the IL-6
signaling pathway is an ideal target for drug development.
Additional studies into the effects of IL-6 blockers in
breast cancer are thus warranted and could offer exciting
new directions for treatment. The critical challenges will
be to identify which candidates will most effectively
repress IL-6 signaling in breast cancer without adverse
effects. With an increased understanding of the IL-6/IL6R/gp130 regulatory axis and signaling in breast cancer, it
may be possible to design new IL-6 therapies which will
be more effective.

PERSPECTIVES ON THE APPLICATION
OF DIRECT IL-6/IL-6R/GP130 BLOCKERS
IN BREAST CANCER
Numerous IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 blockers have been
described and developed as anti-inflammatory drugs,
and some of them have also been studied as anticancer
agents. However, preclinical and clinical studies on the
effectiveness of IL-6 targeting agents for breast cancer are
limited despite the substantial body of evidence indicating
that high levels of IL-6 contribute to the poor prognosis
and promotion of breast cancer. Among the IL-6 targeting
agents, raloxifene and bazedoxifene, have been studied as
anti-breast cancer agents based on a mechanism involving
antagonizing estrogen action. A novel mechanism of
gp130 targeting action was reported for raloxifene and
