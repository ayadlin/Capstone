ABSTRACT
We have recently demonstrated that the undifferentiated PSA−/lo prostate cancer
(PCa) cell population harbors self-renewing long-term tumor-propagating cells that
are refractory to castration, thus representing a therapeutic target. Our goals here
are, by using the same lineage-tracing reporter system, to track the dynamic changes
of PSA−/lo and PSA+ cells upon castration in vitro, investigate the molecular changes
accompanying persistent castration, and develop large numbers of PSA−/lo PCa cells
for drug screening. To these ends, we treated LNCaP cells infected with the PSAPGFP reporter with three regimens of castration, i.e., CDSS, CDSS plus bicalutamide,
and MDV3100 continuously for up to ~21 months. We observed that in the first ~7
months, castration led to time-dependent increases in PSA−/lo cells, loss of AR and
PSA expression, increased expression of cancer stem cell markers, and many other
molecular changes. Meanwhile, castrated LNCaP cells became resistant to high
concentrations of MDV3100, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other agents. However,
targeted and medium-throughput library screening identified several kinase (e.g.,
IGF-1R, AKT, PI3K/mTOR, Syk, GSK3) inhibitors as well as the BCL2 inhibitor that
could effectively sensitize the LNCaP-CRPC cells to killing. Of interest, LNCaP cells
castrated for >7 months showed evidence of cyclic changes in AR and the mTOR/AKT
signaling pathways potentially involving epigenetic mechanisms. These observations
indicate that castration elicits numerous molecular changes and leads to enrichment
of PSA−/lo PCa cells. The ability to generate large numbers of PSA−/lo PCa cells should
allow future high-throughput screening to identify novel therapeutics that specifically
target this population.

such as androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific
antigen (PSA). In contrast, poorly differentiated PCa
lacks glandular structures and differentiated cells.
Androgen signaling has been the primary target for PCa
treatment for >70 years. However, androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT) only achieves short-term efficacy due to
the emergence of castration-resistant disease (CRPC).
This may be partly related to the cellular heterogeneity
of prostate tumors, in which distinct subpopulations
of drug-resistant tumor cells can survive ADT and then
repopulate the tumor [1]. Recent evidence suggests that
the population of PCa cells in untreated primary tumors
that survive ADT may expresses little/no AR (i.e., AR−/lo)
and possesses many cancer stem cell (CSC) properties
[2–4]. Supporting this concept of prostate CSCs (PCSCs)
is the ample literature that indicates that untreated patient
tumors contain a fraction of AR−/lo PCa cells that tend to
increase as tumors progress and especially upon treatment
and recurrence [2, 3, 5, 6].
Untreated PCa also harbors PCa cells that lack
significant expression of PSA [2, 3], a direct target
of AR. These PSA−/lo PCa cells, like AR−/lo cells, also
tend to increase in advanced and recurrent PCa [2, 3].
Furthermore, AR and PSA protein expression in PCa is
frequently discordant with some PCa cells completely
lacking the expression of either or both [2, 3, 5] Using a
lentiviral PSA reporter (i.e., PSAP-GFP), we were able to
separate the PSA−/lo PCa cells from the PSA+ counterparts
to study their distinct biological and tumorigenic
properties. We find that the PSA−/lo PCa cells are quiescent,
refractory to stresses including androgen deprivation,
exhibit high clonogenic potential, possess long-term
tumor-propagating capacity, preferentially express stem
cell genes, and can undergo asymmetric division to
generate differentiated cells. Important, the PSA−/lo PCa
cell population is enriched in AR−/lo cells, resist castration
treatment, and can initiate robust tumor development in
fully castrated mice [2, 3].
The ultimate goal of our research is to better
characterize and find novel therapeutics targeting the
PSA−/lo PCSC pool [2, 3]. The PSA−/lo population in
untreated PCa cell cultures and reporter tumors is
generally rare being <1-20% [2, 3]. Also, when these cells
are freshly purified via flow cytometry, they are fragile
and not amenable to drug screening. To overcome these
limitations and to dynamically track the changes in PSA−/
lo
and PSA+ cell subpopulations in response to androgen
deprivation, here we chronically exposed LNCaP cells
to 3 regimens of castration in vitro, to mimic continuous
treatment of patient prostate tumors by anti-androgens. We
report that persistent castration of LNCaP cells leads to,
within the first ~7 months, the generation of homogenous
AR−/lo PSA−/lo cell population that has undergone many
molecular changes, in addition to alterations in the AR
pathway, and is highly refractory to MDV3100 and other
therapeutic drugs but amenable for high throughput drug

screening and remains sensitive to BCL2 antagonist and
several kinase inhibitors.

RESULTS
Establishment of traceable LNCaP-CRPC cells
LNCaP, initially established from a lymph node
metastasis [7, 8], is the most commonly used PCa cell
line and has been widely utilized to derive sublines and
clonal cultures to model PCa cell response to androgen
deprivation (e.g., [9-22]). All these previous studies
used bulk LNCaP cells without taking into account the
subpopulation heterogeneity [2, 3]. For example, regular
LNCaP cultures have cells expressing high levels of AR
(i.e., AR+) and PSA (i.e., PSA+) as well as cells expressing
little/no AR (i.e., AR−/lo) and PSA (PSA−/lo) [2, 3; also
see Supplementary Figure S2, below]. We have recently
employed a lentiviral-based reporter system in which
a PSA promoter (PSAP) drives GFP or RFP (Figure
1A; Supplementary Figure S1A) to PROSPECTIVELY
separate the two lineage-related subpopulations (i.e., PSA+
and PSA−/lo) of PCa cells [2]. Comprehensive studies
demonstrate that the phenotypically undifferentiated
PSA−/lo PCa cell population harbors self-renewing longterm tumor-propagating cells that are intrinsically refractory
to castration [2, 3]. In this project, we first aim to employ
this tracing system to longitudinally track the dynamic
changes of the same two subpopulations of LNCaP cells in
response to chronic androgen deprivation in vitro.
LNCaP cells regularly cultured in 7% FBScontaining medium and infected with the PSAP-GFP
lentiviral reporter (Figure 1A) contained 5.39 ± 3.18% (n
= 12) GFP−/lo cells (i.e., bottom 6-10% GFP−/lo population
on FACS) (Figure 1B). Freshly purified GFP−/lo LNCaP
cells expressed little AR or its targets PSA and FKBP5,
analogous to the AR− PSA− PC3 cells (Figure 1C). In
contrast, the corresponding GFP+ cells (i.e., top 5-10%
of GFP-bright cells on FACS) expressed all three
proteins (Figure 1C). Neither cell population expressed
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Figure 1C), which was
recently reported to confer resistance to antiandrogens
[23]. As the PSAP-GFP lentiviral system faithfully reports
endogenous PSA expression [2], in foregoing experiments,
we often interchangeably use GFP+/GFP−/lo and PSA+/
PSA−/lo.
We infected LNCaP cells with the PSAP-GFP at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25, at which virtually
all cells were infected (Figure 1C; 2). We then treated
the infected LNCaP cells with 3 regimens of castration:
charcoal dextran-stripped serum (CDSS), CDSS with
bicalutamide (10 μM), and MDV3100 (Enzalutamide,
10  μM) continuously for up to ~2 years (Figure 1D),
which resulted in the long-term castration-resistant LNCaP
sublines that we termed LNCaP-CRPC cells, i.e., LNCaPCDSS, LNCaP-CDSS+Bicalutamide, and LNCaP-MDV.

LNCaP-CRPC sublines (Figure 1E–1F). As shown in
Figure 1E, infected but untreated LNCaP-GFP (parental)
cells exhibited steady increases in cumulative population
doublings (PDs). The 3 treated LNCaP cell types all grew

slower in the beginning and hit a “bump” or “crisis” point
around 2-3 weeks when there was little net increase in PDs
(Figure 1E; asterisks). Then the treated cells began to grow
with a steady increase in PDs, although at slower paces than
the untreated LNCaP-GFP cells (Figure 1E). Indeed, after 3

Castrated LNCaP cultures gradually lose PSA+
cells as well as AR and PSA expression

months of treatment, all three LNCaP-CRPC lines showed
much lower end-point live cell numbers (Figure 1F, top),
suggesting that they were less proliferative and/or more
susceptible to cell death. Interestingly, at ~4 months (125
days), there was a noticeable increase in the growth kinetics
in all 3 LNCaP-CRPC sublines (Figure 1E). In support,
all 3 LNCaP-CRPC cultures continuously treated for 10
or 17 months showed significantly more live cell numbers
compared to the time-matched control LNCaP-GFP cells
(Figure 1F).
We further characterized LNCaP-GFP and
LNCaP-MDV cells at crisis point (3 weeks) and found
that MDV3100 treatment led to both increased cellcycle arrest (Figure 1G) and cell death (Figure 1H).
Specifically, more LNCaP-MDV cells remained in the
G1 phase compared to LNCaP-GFP cells (87.1% versus
67.7%) and less were at the G2/M phase (27% versus
10.5%) (Figure 1G). With respect to cell death, ~90%
untreated LNCaP-GFP cells were viable; in contrast,
only 42% LNCaP-MDV cells treated for 3 weeks were
viable with 31% of cells being apoptotic and 24% being
necrotic (Figure 1H).

We monitored dynamic changes in GFP+ cells in
chronically castrated LNCaP cells (Figure 2). As early
as 1 week after treatment, there was a ~5-10% decrease
in GFP+ population in all 3 conditions (Figure 2B). By
4-5 weeks, there were 15-25% decreases in GFP+ cells
with concomitant increases in GFP−/lo (PSA−/lo) cells, with
MDV3100 showing the strongest effect (Figure 2A–2B).
By 2 months, the GFP+ population dropped to ~70% in all
3 LNCaP-CRPC cultures and at 5-7 months the GFP+ cell
population dramatically decreased (Figure 2A and 2C).
By 9 months after treatment, there were barely detectable
GFP+ cells in the 3 LNCaP-CRPC sublines (Figure 2A
and 2C). In contrast to these castration-induced changes,
untreated LNCaP-GFP cells remained mostly GFP+ over
the 9-month treatment period (Figure 2).
We further tracked the changes in PSA+ cells in
castrated LNCaP cells infected with a tracing vector
that contained a built-in RFP reporter driven by CMV
promoter (Supplementary Figure S1; S2). This dual

reporter system allowed us to monitor alterations of PSA+
(GFP+) cells in infected (i.e., RFP+) cells (Supplementary
Figure S1A). As observed with the PSAP-GFP reporter,
all three castration regimens led to a gradual decrease
in GFP+ cells whereas all surviving cells remained
RFP+ (Supplementary Figure S1B-S1D). By 6 months,
only very few LNCaP-CRPC cells were dimly GFP+
(Supplementary Figure S1C).
Accompanying the loss of PSA+ cells was a timedependent decrease in AR and PSA mRNAs in the three
LNCaP-CRPC cultures (Figure 3A). Western blotting
showed that at 3 weeks of treatment, LNCaP-CRPC
cells expressed AR protein and its 4 targets, i.e., PSA,
FKBP5, PAP, and PSMA (Figure 3B). Interestingly,
the 3-week treated cultures showed several lower
AR bands that could represent the AR splice variants
though none of these bands represented AR-V7 since
an AR-V7 specific antibody (Figure 3C) failed to detect
any products in the LNCaP-CRPC cultures (Figure 3B).
Remarkably, at 9-26 weeks, all 3 LNCaP-CRPC lines
lost AR and PSA protein expression and also showed
decreased expression of other AR targets (Figure 3B).
In the independent experiment using the dual reporter
system, AR and PSA proteins decreased as early as
1 week after the initiation of castration (Supplementary

Figure S1E). Interestingly, the LNCaP-abl [9], a cas­
tration-resistant LNCaP subline commonly used to
study resistance mechanisms (24), were AR+ PSA−
(Figure 3B), as we reported recently [3].
Together, these longitudinal tracking experiments
indicate that in vitro castration leads to a loss of
differentiated AR+ PSA+ LNCaP cells, as further supported
by immunofluorescence staining of AR and PSA in the
5-month (5-mo) LNCaP-CRPC cells (Supplementary
Figure S2).

LNCaP-CRPC cells also demonstrate changes in
many other signaling molecules
In addition to the AR signaling pathway, we
also examined changes in several molecules related
to castration resistance (BCL2 and SOX9), epithelialmesenchymal transition or EMT (E-cadherin, SLUG,
and vimentin), and CSCs (i.e., CD44, integrin α2β1, and
ABCG2) [2-4, 20, 25-33] (Figure 3B; Supplementary
Figure S3). Flow cytometry revealed time-dependent
increases in cells expressing high levels of 3 CSC markers
in LNCaP-CRPC cultures (Supplementary Figure S3),
consistent with the notion that castration enriches for
stem-like cancer cells (2-4). All other molecules showed

Single cell tracking of LNCaP cell response to
castration reveals distinct drug sensitivity in
parental LNCaP vs. LNCaP-MDV cells

variegated changes (Figure 3B). For example, BCL2,
an anti-apoptotic molecule shown previously to be
upregulated during castration [20], actually exhibited
slight decreases in our LNCaP-CRPC cells (Figure 3B).
SOX9, a stem cell molecule recently reported to be
regulated by AR [25], showed rapid downregulation in
3-week castrated LNCaP cells and then slightly increased
in long-term LNCaP-CRPC cells (Figure 3B). Castration
has been linked to EMT [31–33]. However, our LNCaPCRPC cells showed decreased E-cadherin and subtle
changes in SLUG and vimentin (Figure 3B). N-cadherin
was not expressed in parental LNCaP cells nor was it
induced in LNCaP-CRPC cells (data not shown). These
results suggest that castration resistance in LNCaP cells
in our experimental conditions is not associated with
apparent EMT.

We employed time-lapse video microscopy [2, 3]
to further monitor the survival and division mode of
single parental LNCaP (i.e., LNCaP-GFP) and LNCaPMDV (both at 6-mo) cells to fresh MDV3100 treatment
(Figure 4). As we observed previously [2, 3], in untreated
LNCaP cultures, GFP+ (PSA+) cells, which represented
the bulk (i.e., ~95%), underwent rapid symmetrical cell
divisions with average cell-cycle transit time of 16.5±8.4
h (n=48 cells) (Figure 4A; Figure 4D, top). In response to
acute MDV3100 treatment (10 μM), most GFP+ LNCaP
cells underwent cell-cycle arrest and/or death without
cell division (Figure 4B; Figure 4D, middle). Many GFP+

LNCaP cells never divided during the entire >160 h
recording period (Figure 4B). In contrast to MDV3100treated parental GFP+ LNCaP cells, the 6-mo LNCaPMDV cells, all of which were GFP−, behaved like the
untreated GFP+ parent LNCaP cells and divided fast
in the presence of MDV3100 with a cell-cycle time of
25.6±16.7 h (n=35 cells) (Figure 4C; Figure 4D, bottom
panels). This defined single-cell tracking experiment
provides direct evidence that 1) acute MDV3100 treatment
of PSA+ LNCaP cells causes prominent cell-cycle arrest
and/or cell death, and 2) the chronically castrated PSA−/

cells (Figure 5A–5B). On the other hand, both LNCaPGFP and LNCaP-CRPC cells did not appreciably respond
to Imetalstat, metformin and Aza and both showed only
slight responses to XAV-939 (Figure 5C), suggesting that
either these inhibitors were ineffective or needed >72 h to
manifest effects. Importantly, however, the 5-mo LNCaPCRPC cells, like LNCaP-GFP cells, responded, in a dosedependent manner, to ABT-199 and 3 kinase inhibitors,
i.e., SB431542, SU 5402, and AEW541 (Figure  5D),
implicating potentially critical roles of BCL2 and
TGFBR1, VEGFR1/FGFR1, and IGF-1R signaling in the
survival of LNCaP-CRPC cells.
The results with AEW541 were especially
interesting as we previously showed the involvement of
IGF-1R in positively regulating the PSA−/lo LNCaP cells
[2] and the IGF/IGF-1R signaling pathway has been
implicated in CRPC progression [39]. Indeed, AEW541
prominently inhibited growth of AR− PSA− Du145 and
PC3 cells by causing apoptosis (Figure 6A–6D). AEW541
also inhibited the bulk LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 6E). Significantly, although the PSA−/lo
PCa cells are highly resistant to castration, prooxidants,
and some chemotherapeutic drugs [2, 3], AEW541
exhibited inhibitory effects on both PSA+ as well as PSA−/
lo
LNCaP cells by causing increased apoptosis (Figure
6F–6G). AEW541 also inhibited the spherogenic activities
in LNCaP cells (Figure 6H–6J). Finally, we found that
AEW541 at 10 μM was as effective as CDSS+MDV3100
(20 μM) in suppressing LNCaP cell growth (Figure 6K)
and that in VCaP cells, AEW541 was more effective than
CDSS+MDV3100 (Figure 6L).
A drug-screening experiment in the 10.5-mo
LNCaP-CRPC cells, which also expressed little AR
(see Figure 8A), revealed overall very similar response
patterns to the 5-mo LNCaP-CRPC cells except for
several noticeable differences in the group of sensitive
drugs (Supplementary Figure S4). For instance, the 10.5mo LNCaP-CRPC cells became more resistant to 10 μM
ABT-199 and AEW541 although they were still sensitive
to higher concentrations of both inhibitors. In addition,
the 10.5-mo LNCaP-CRPC cells displayed resistance to
50 μM SB431542 and 100 μM SU 5402 (Supplementary
Figure S4). These results suggest that compared to the
5-mo LNCaP cells, the 10.5-mo LNCaP-CRPC cells
developed further resistance to the initially sensitive drugs.
Interestingly, LNCaP-abl cells, which were AR+
−
PSA (Figure 3B; 3), showed both similar and different
responses compared to the 5-mo LNCaP-CRPC (AR−
PSA−; Figure 3B) cells and to LNCaP-GFP (AR+ PSA+;
Figure 3B) cells (Figure 5) as well. For example, LNCaPabl cells exhibited a dose-dependent sensitivity to both
MDV-3100 and Bicalutamide (Figure 5A). LNCaP-abl
cells also demonstrated exquisite sensitivity to docetaxel
and Avicin (Figure 5A–5B). On the other hand, LNCaPabl cells were reproducibly more resistant to 10 μM of
ABT-199 (Figure 5A; data not shown). These results

LNCaP-CRPC cells are refractory to further
castration and chemotherapeutic drugs but
sensitive to anti-BCL-2 and several kinase
inhibitors
To test whether the long-term LNCaP-CRPC cells
would be refractory to ‘therapeutic’ treatments other than
antiandrogens, we treated 5-mo LNCaP-GFP and the
3 LNCaP-CRPC cell types, for 72 h, with a ‘candidate
library’ of 15 compounds that included: 2 antiandrogens
(MDV3100 and Bicalutamide), 2 chemotherapeutic drugs
(docetaxel and etoposide), 2 plant-derived experimental
drugs (Avicin and Oxetane; [34]), a telomerase inhibitor
(Imetalstat, also called GRN163L; [35]), Metformin
(an  antidiabetic drug shown to inhibit CSCs; [36]), a
selective BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 [37, 38], 2 epigenetic
inhibitors, i.e., 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (Aza, an inhibitor
of DNA methyltransferase) and trichostatin A (TSA, a
histone deacetylase inhibitor), and 4 inhibitors of signaling
pathways, i.e., XAV-939 that inhibits Wnt/b-catenin;
SB431542 that inhibits TGFBR1; SU 5402 that inhibits
VEGFR1 and FGFR1; and AEW541 that inhibits the IGF1R (Figure 5; Supplementary Table S2). We used H2O2
as a control, which non-selectively killed all cell types at
≥5 μM, and also compared with the drug sensitivities of
LNCaP-abl cells (Figure 5).
This ‘targeted’ drug screening revealed that the
5-mo LNCaP-CRPC cells that lacked AR and PSA
expression, within 72 h, were resistant to antiandrogens,
chemotherapeutic drugs (docetaxel, etoposide, Avicin,
and Oxetane), and TSA (Figure 5A–5B), non-responsive
to Imetastat, Metformin, Aza, and XAV-939 (Figure 5C)
but sensitive to ABT-199, SB431512, SU 5402, and
AEW541 (Figure 5D). Specifically, MDV3100 dosedependently inhibited LNCaP-GFP cells but the LNCaPCRPC cells showed resistance to even 200 μM of
MDV3100 (Figure 5A). Bicalutamide, known to be less
potent that MDV3100 in antagonizing AR (Supplementary
Table S2), did not affect LNCaP-GFP or LNCaP-CRPC
cells, even at 200 μM. Interestingly, LNCaP-CRPC cells
demonstrated most prominent resistance to docetaxel,
Avicin, Oxetane, and TSA compared to LNCaP-GFP

cells continue to require and depend on PI3K/mTOR/
AKT signaling for their survival, consistent with LNCaP
cells having PTEN mutation and with well-established
involvement of the PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway in CRPC
[4, 40, 41].
Several other kinase inhibitors also displayed
varying levels of inhibitory effects on LNCaP-MDV
cells, which included EMD572660 (inhibiting PDGFRβ;
IC50=2.628, 4.943, and 4.988 μM for parental, 5-mo and
16-mo LNCaP-MDV cells, respectively; Figure 7D),
EMD361550 (targeting GSK-3α/α; IC50=6.362, 5.638,
and 4.638 μM for the 3 cell types, respectively; Figure
7E), EMD238811 (inhibiting CDK9; Figure 7F. Note IC50
values could not be determined), CCT137690 (targeting
Aurora kinases A/B/C; Figure 7G), Tocris 2539 (inhibiting
IKK; IC50=5.04, 6.68, and 6.62 μM for parental, 5-mo
and 16-mo LNCaP-MDV, respectively; Figure 7H),
Tocris 2471 (inhibiting Syk; IC50=1.95, 2.82, and 2.08
μM for parental, 5-mo and 16-mo LNCaP-MDV cells,
respectively; Figure 7I), and LND193189 (inhibiting
TFG-β/Smad; IC50=3.12, 4.61, and 2.27 μM for parental,
5-mo and 16-mo LNCaP-MDV cells, respectively;
Figure 7J). Many of these signaling pathways have been
implicated in PCa progression and/or therapy resistance
[42–48].
Interestingly, these latter inhibitors showed slight
growth-promoting effects at 0.1-2 μM followed by
inhibitory effects in the parental LNCaP-GFP cells
(Figure 7D–7J). In contrast, the LNCaP-MDV cells did
not manifest this bi-phasic response pattern (Figure 7D–
7J). Taken together, the kinase inhibitor library screening
indicates that castration-resistant LNCaP-MDV cells
engage multiple kinase signaling pathways, including
PI3K/AKT/mTOR, PDGFR, GSK-3, IKK, Syk, and
TGFb/Smad, for their survival and proliferation.

Further evidence that LNCaP-CRPC cells
remain sensitive to kinase inhibitors
Prompted by the preceding observations that
LNCaP-CRPC cells are sensitive to some kinase inhibitors
(Figure 5D; Supplementary Figure S4), we screened
5-mo LNCaP-GFP (parental), 5-mo LNCaP-MDV, and
16-mo LNCaP-MDV cells against a collection of 752
inhibitors of >140 human kinases (Supplementary Figure
S5A; Supplementary Table S3). This library contained
183 inhibitors that target multiple Ser/Thr kinases (e.g.,
CDKs, GSK3, MAPK/ERK/MEK), 155 inhibitors of
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), 88 inhibitors of PI3K/
AKT/mTOR signaling, and inhibitors that target many
other kinases (Supplementary Figure S5A; Supplementary
Table S3). The 3 LNCaP cell types were subjected to a
3-step screening protocol, i.e., primary and secondary
screens and validation (Supplementary Figure S5B-S5C)
and only those inhibitors (at 10 μM) that demonstrated
>40% inhibition in both primary and secondary screens
were considered true ‘hit’ compounds. Primary screen
resulted in 128, 31, and 30 hits whereas secondary screen
resulted in 44, 11, and 10 hits in LNCaP-GFP, 5-mo
LNCaP-MDV, and 16-mo LNCaP-MDV cells, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S5C; Table 1). The decreased
number of hits in the LNCaP-MDV cells indicates that
the chronically selected CRPC cells are resistant to most
kinase inhibitors tested.
An analysis of the secondary screen hit compounds
(Table 1) and validation studies (Figure 7) on most
of the hits using freshly purchased compounds at a
range of concentrations (i.e., 0.1, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0
μM) revealed some interesting results. For example,
EMD341251, which blocks the CDK4/D1 activity
(Supplementary Table S2), not only inhibited LNCaP-GFP
cells but also, partially, LNCaP-MDV cells (IC50=1.15,
1.37, and 6.71 μM for parental, 5-mo and 16-mo LNCaPMDV cells, respectively) although, not surprisingly, the
5-mo and, especially, the 16-mo LNCaP-MDV cells
were more resistant (Figure 7). These results suggest
that the castration-resistant LNCaP-CRPC cells partially
rely on CDK4/D1 for their continued proliferative
capacity, consistent with recent observations by others
[4, 21]. NVP-BGT226, a dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor,
exhibited a similar inhibitory pattern in LNCaP-GFP
and LNCaP-MDV cells to EMD341251 (Figure 7B;
Table 1 ). Interestingly, EMD124011, an AKT inhibitor
(Supplementary Table S2), exhibited impressive growthinhibitory effects on both LNCaP-GFP and LNCaP-MDV
cells (IC50=1.085, 2.417, and 2.045 μM for parental, 5-mo
and 16-mo LNCaP-MDV cells, respectively; Figure 7C).
Together, these observations suggest that LNCaP-MDV

Evidence for cyclic changes of AR and PI3K/
mTOR/AKT signaling molecules in LNCaP
CRPC cells and for epigenetic involvement
during MDV3100 treatment
We further examined the long-term molecular
changes in MDV3100-treated LNCaP cells (Figure 8A).
As observed earlier (Figure 3B), LNCaP cells treated with
MDV3100 for up to 7 months lacked expression of AR and
PSA proteins (Figure 8A). Accompanying the loss of AR,
cells activated AKT at 3 weeks post MDV3100 treatment
as evidenced by increased p-AKT/AKT ratio, which
subsequently declined (Figure 8A; Figure S6A). The
LNCaP-MDV cells at 5-6 months still expressed slightly
higher levels of p-AKT than LNCaP-GFP cells (Figure 8A;
data not shown). When parental LNCaP-GFP cells were
treated with EMD124011, AKT was lost within 24 h
accompanied by a rapid decrease of p-AKT (Figure 8B).
Strikingly, EMD124011 induced even faster loss of AKT
and p-AKT in the 5-mo LNCaP-MDV cells (Figure 8B),

potentially explaining the exquisite sensitivity of LNCaPMDV cells to EMD124011 (Figure 7C). Surprisingly, both
mTOR and p-mTOR levels significantly decreased at 3
weeks to 7 months post MDV3100 treatment (Figure 8A).
Indeed, the 5-mo LNCaP-MDV cells showed low levels
of mTOR and barely detectable p-mTOR (Figure 8C; time
0 lanes). Treatment of LNCaP-GFP cells with the PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor NVP-BGT226 led to decreased mTOR/pmTOR levels at 24 h but increased mTOR/p-mTOR levels
at 48 and 72 h (Figure 8C). The 5-mo LNCaP-MDV cells
showed overall a similar response pattern to NVP-BGT226
(Figure 8C). These results suggest that the sensitivities of
LNCaP-GFP and LNCaP-MDV cells to NVP-BGT226
(Figure 7B) likely resulted from the inhibition of PI3K.
To our great surprises, AR, PSA, p-AKT, and
mTOR/p-mTOR levels showed cyclic changes throughout
the 21-month treatment period such that at 8-9 months,
all 4 proteins increased and then declined afterwards,
and increased again at ~17 months then decreased or lost
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 8A). This cyclic pattern of changes implicates
the involvement of certain epigenetic mechanisms in
MDV3100-treated LNCaP cells. In support, when we
probed the same panel of time-related samples for four
histone 3 (H3) marks, i.e., H3K27ace (an enhancer
mark), H3K4me1 (also an enhancer mark), H3K4me3 (an
activation mark), and H3K27me3 (a repressive mark), we
also observed cyclic changes in these marks, in particular,
H3K27me3 (Supplementary Figure S6B). In further
support of epigenetic mechanisms, when we put the 14mo AR−/PSA− LNCaP-MDV cells (Figure 8A) back into
the normal culture medium (RPMI+7% FBS), AR (but not
PSA) started to re-emerge around 6 months and became
strong at 8 months (Supplementary Figure S6C).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have, for the first time,
longitudinally tracked the response of LNCaP cells,
14231

to castration for up to ~2 years. The most important
distinction of our study from all earlier related work is
that we employed the PSAP-GFP/RFP lineage-tracing

reporters to monitor the dynamic changes in the PSA−/
lo
and PSA+ subpopulations of the LNCaP cells upon
blockade of androgen signaling. One of the major findings

5-mo and 10-mo LNCaP-MDV cells were treated with freshly purchased 10 compounds at 0, 0.1, 1, 2, 5, and 10 μM for 72 h. Live cell
numbers were determined via an AlmarBlue assay. The results were presented as % cell survival relative to DMSO control. Cell survival
curves were generated by applying the smooth marked scatter plot in Excel with standard deviation as error bar. For IC50 determination,
we used prism to perform the nonlinear regression fit between the log concentration and the response with variable slope.

is that 3 different castration regimens all gradually result
in decrease and loss of the mRNAs and proteins of AR
and its target PSA, leading to increasing numbers of PSA−/
lo
cells. In regular serum-containing LNCaP cultures, the

majority of cells are PSA+; however, there is a minor
population of PSA−/lo LNCaP cells (Figure 1B; Figure
8D) [2]. Flow cytometry analysis of castrated LNCaP
cells at multiple consecutive time points indicates that

castration leads to loss of PSA+ cells. Time lapse-based
single cell tracing also provides direct evidence that the
PSA+ LNCaP cells respond to MDV3100 by undergoing
rapid cell-cycle arrest and cell death (Figure 4B). Loss of
PSA+ LNCaP cells should lead to the enrichment of PSA−/
lo
cells (Figure 8D, b). These observations are consistent
with our recent demonstration that freshly purified PSA+
LNCaP cells are more sensitive to apoptosis induction by
castration and chemotherapeutic drugs compared to the
PSA−/lo cells [3]. In ~2-3 months, castrated LNCaP cultures
have largely lost both AR and PSA proteins (Figure 3B;
Figure 8A) resulting in mostly PSA−/lo cells (Figure 8D,
c). These results are not particularly surprising considering
that PSA+ PCa cells all express high levels of nuclear AR
[2, 3] and, in the absence of androgens (CDSS) and/or
with the blockade of AR signaling (CDSS+bicalutamide
and MDV3100), AR will be degraded leading to the
death of AR+/PSA+ PCa cells and time-related enrichment
of AR−/PSA− cells. On the other hand, there exists a
possibility that some PSA+ LNCaP cells, under castration,
may undergo de-differentiation and thus contribute to
the enlarging pool of PSA−/lo cells. We are currently
developing genetic tracing tools that can allow us to
directly test this possibility.
The resultant PSA−/lo LNCaP-CRPC cells are highly
resistant to further castration by high levels of MDV3100
(i.e., 200 μM) as well as to chemotherapeutic drugs
(Figure 5A–5B). What mechanisms could be responsible
for this multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype in
LNCaP-CRPC cells? We have previously shown [2, 3]
that the PSA−/lo PCa cells can undergo asymmetric
cell division, possess stem cell gene expression and
epigenetic profiles, possess unlimited tumor-propagating
capabilities and can recreate the tumor cell heterogeneity,
and, importantly, are intrinsically resistant to castration,
chemodrugs, and prooxidants (Figure 8D, a). In contrast,
the PSA+ PCa cells only undergo symmetric cell division,
possess more limited tumor-propagating activity, and
are sensitive to castration and chemodrugs [2, 3] (Figure
8D, a). Therefore, the MDR phenotype of our long-term
LNCaP-CRPC cells may be self-evidently explained by
that fact that they are homogeneously enriched PSA−/lo
cells. The LNCaP-CRPC cells have also acquired some
phenotypic CSC markers including CD44, α2β1, and
ABCG2, all of which have been shown by us to enrich for
tumor-initiating and tumor-propagating cells in different
PCa models [2, 3, 28-30]. Upregulation of ABCG2 may
contribute to the MDR properties of the LNCaP-CRPC
cells via mediating the efflux of the drug MDV3100 or
bicalutamide. Of note, our LNCaP-CRPC cells have not
undergone EMT, which has been linked to castration
resistance [31–33], or neuroendocrine differentiation
(Rycaj et al., unpublished observations). Also, as the
LNCaP-CRPC cells lose AR, AR mutations (e.g., 21)
unlikely represent a major mechanism mediating their
resistance to further castration and other treatments.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Are LNCaP-CRPC cells susceptible to any other
chemical inhibitors or therapeutics? A targeted library
screening reveals that they are sensitive to ABT-199
and AEW541, thus implicating BCL2 and IGF-1R as
critical survival factors for the LNCaP-CRPC cells.
These observations are fully consistent with our earlier
comparative cDNA microarray analysis showing the
preferential expression of both molecules in the PSA−/
lo
PCa cells [2]. A medium-throughput screening against
a collection of ~750 inhibitors of >140 human kinases
reveals the importance of another critical cell survival
signaling pathway, i.e., PI3K/AKT, in maintaining the
survival of LNCaP-CRPC cells. These results make sense
because one of the earliest responses we have observed
in LNCaP cells exposed to castration is cell death (Figure
1H; Figure 4). ~3 weeks after MDV3100 treatment, AKT
is activated (Figure 8A), presumably to extend the survival
of the treated cells. The kinase inhibitor screening also
identifies partial inhibitory effects of a CDK4 inhibitor
on the LNCaP-CRPC cells, indicating that these cells rely
on the CDK4/D1 signaling for their proliferation. Finally,
the kinase inhibitor library screening implicates several
other kinases, including PDGFRβ, GSK-3, IKK, Syk,
and TGFb/Smad, in the survival and/or proliferation of
LNCaP-CRPC cells. All of these signaling pathways have
been implicated, to some degrees, in PCa cell survival
and therapy resistance [42–48]. The results with the Syk
inhibitor were of particular interest as this tyrosine kinase
was recently shown to regulate the invasive and metastatic
properties of PCa cells via positively modulating integrin
α2β1 and CD44 expression [42], the two molecules also
upregulated in our LNCaP-CRPC cells. Taken together,
the chemical library screenings demonstrate that the
long-term LNCaP-CRPC cells have developed prominent
resistance to further castrations and chemotherapeutic
drugs but remain sensitive, at least partially, to inhibitors
of BCL-2 and several protein kinases including IGF-1R,
PI3K/AKT, CDK4/D1, PDGFRβ, GSK-3, IKK, Syk, and
TGF-b/Smad. It should be noted that LNCaP cells have
been shown to be insensitive to TGFβ stimulation due to
genetic changes in TGFB type I receptor [49]; therefore,
the inhibitory effects of TGFb inhibitors could be mediated
in both TGFb-dependent and independent mechanisms.
Our long-term LNCaP-CRPC cells, despite being
phenotypically PSA−/lo, behave apparently differently
from the small subpopulation of PSA−/lo LNCaP cells
that pre-exist in untreated bulk cultures in that they
proliferate nearly as rapidly as the untreated bulk
PSA+ cells (Figure 8D, c) whereas the preexistent
subpopulation of PSA−/lo LNCaP cells are largely
quiescent [2, 3]. Persistent castration may likely
engage/activate significant epigenetic mechanisms.
This possibility is strongly supported by the striking
observations that AR, PSA, AKT, and mTOR/p-mTOR
proteins all undergo cyclic changes in long-term
MDV3100-treated LNCaP cells. In further support,
14234

Oncotarget

we have also observed cyclic changes in several
epigenetic regulatory histone marks, in particular, the
H3K27me3 mark. Moreover, we could restore AR
protein expression in AR−/PSA− LNCaP-MDV cells by
simply reverting the cells back to their normal culture
medium. Although the precise epigenetic mechanisms
underlying the cyclic changes in AR and other proteins
remain to be determined, such mechanisms may
likely have contributed to seemingly quite different
castration-resistant LNCaP sublines and clones reported
by different groups, with some showing upregulated
AR [e.g., 9, 13, 14, 16] whereas others lacking AR/
PSA expression [e.g., 10-12, 15, 17-19; this study]
(Figure 8D, c). This latter point can be clearly seen in
the side-by-side comparison of our LNCaP-CRPC vs.
LNCaP-abl cells – the AR− PSA− LNCaP-CRPC and
AR+ PSA− LNCaP abl cells display many differences
in their responses to various targeted therapeutics
(Figure  5). This is interesting as both LNCaP-CDSS
cells and LNCaP-abl cells are derived by long-term
exposing the parental LNCaP cells to CDSS (9; this
study). It is unclear why different groups generate
LNCaP (clonal or bulk) sublines that are quite different
with respect to AR/PSA expression when using
similar castration protocols. Recent deep sequencing
data suggest that, surprisingly, LNCaP cells are
‘hypermutable’ and individual LNCaP cells manifest
great differences in their exomic sequences [50, 51].
The present study demonstrates that chemical
castration including MDV3100 treatment elicits not only
changes in the AR signaling pathway but also multiple
other molecular changes as well as epigenetic alterations,
which together reprogram androgen-responsive LNCaP
cells to castration- and multidrug-resistant PSA−/lo cells. The
availability of large numbers of PSA−/lo cells should pave the
way for future high throughput screening efforts to identify
novel therapeutics that specifically target this population.

compounds are presented in Table 1.

Generation of LNCaP-CRPC cell lines
LNCaP cells freshly infected with PSAP-GFP
or the PSAP-GFP/DsRed lentiviral constructs were
plated in complete RPMI media and allowed to recover
for 48 h under normal culture conditions. Cells were
then switched to phenol red-free RPMI containing
10% CDSS, 10% CDSS plus bicalutamide (10 μM)
(CDSS+Bic), or MDV3100 (10 μM). Cells were treated
continuously for up to ~2 years with drugs replenished
every 48 h and intermittently used in various assays
described in the text. The resultant long-term castrationresistant LNCaP sublines were designated LNCaPCRPC. Age-matched and untreated LNCaP-GFP cells
(i.e., LNCaP cells infected with the PSAP-GFP vector)
were used as controls.

Lentiviral infection of PCa cells
Basic lentiviral procedures were previously
described [2] and the key vectors used in the present
study are presented in Figure 1A and Supplementary
Figure S1A. Lentivirus was produced in 293FT packaging
cells and titers were determined using GFP positivity in
HT1080 cells. LNCaP cells were infected, generally, at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25.

Cell survival, apoptosis, and cell cycle analysis
To determine total live cell numbers, 5x103 LNCaP
and LNCaP-CRPC cells were plated in triplicate or
quadruplicate in 12-well plates and cultured for 10 days,
with fresh medium fed every 3 days. At the end, viable
cell numbers were counted using trypan blue exclusion
assays. To determine the effect of MDV3100 on LNCaP
parental cells, we performed FACS analysis using the
Vybrant Apoptosis Kit (#V23200; Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, LNCaP cells infected with the PSAP-GFP reporter
construct were treated with MDV3100 (10 μM) every 48 h
for 4 weeks. At the end, cells were harvested and stained
with Biotin-X annexin V followed by Alexa Fluor 504
streptavidin. Finally, cells were stained with propidium

Aria II (BD Biosciences). For cell cycle (DNA content)
analysis, 5x105 cells were plated in a 6 well plate and
allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were harvested, washed,
and resuspended in 1.5 ml of 1x phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) until all cells were in suspension. Next, 3.5 ml of
200 proof ethanol was added drop-wise to the suspension
while vortexing. After storing cells at 4°C for 12 h, cells
were washed with 1xPBS and resuspended in PPR solution
(1xPBS, 10 μg/ml PI, 20 μg/ml RNAse A, 0.5% Tween

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy

AEW541 experiments

Briefly, cells were plated on glass coverslips
overnight. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
for 10 minutes and then washed three times with 1xPBS.
To block and permeabilize, cells were incubated for 60
min at room temperature in a 10% goat serum and 0.5%
Triton solution for AR staining and a 10% goat serum and
0.3% Triton solution for PSA staining. After washing once,
cells were then incubated with antibodies against AR or
PSA plus 10% goat serum and 0.05% Triton for 60 min at
room temperature. Following thorough washing (3X) with
1xPBS, the coverslips were incubated for 60 min at room
temperature with AlexaFluor 594–conjugated goat antirabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen)
(1:500) plus 10% goat serum and 0.05% Triton. After
washing once, cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI, D9452; Sigma) (1:500) for 10 min
at room temperature and slides mounted with ProLong®
Gold anti-fade reagent (#P36931 Invitrogen). Images
were taken using a Nikon Eclipse E800 Fluorescence
Microscope.

Several sets of experiments were conducted with the
AEW541 compound, which specifically inhibits the IGF1R (IC50=150 nM). In one set, PSA−/lo and PSA+ LNCaP
cells were sorted and plated into 96-well plates at 2,000
cells/well in 100-μL medium. 12 h later, initial cell number
was assessed by WST-1 (Roche). Briefly, 10 μl of WST-1
reagent was added into each well and plates were further
incubated up to 4 h at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured at
450 nm using a plate reader. Cells in the rest of the wells
were treated with DMSO (vehicle control) or AEW541
(10 μM) and cell number was measured by WST-1 at the
indicated time points.
In another set of experiments, purified PSA+ and
−/lo
PSA LNCaP cells were resuspended in DMEM/F12
supplemented with B27 (17504-044, Life Science) and
N2 (17502-048, Life Science) and mixed (9:4) thoroughly
with methylcellulose (04100, Stem Cell Technology),
and then added DMSO (ctrl) or 10 μM AEW541, and
plated in 24-well ULA plates at 2,000 cells/wells. Spheres
number and size were counted in ~2 weeks. To test the
combinatorial effects of MDV3100 and AEW541, bulk
LNCaP or VCaP cells were seeded in 96-well plate at
2,000 cells/well in 100 μl of culture medium 12 h before
treatments. Then CDSS+MDV3100 (20 μM) and AEW541
(10 μM) were added, individually or in combination.
After 0 (control time point), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days
of treatment, cell number were assessed using WST-1.
Finally, we analyzed apoptosis in cells treated with
AEW541. PC3, Du145, VCaP or LNCaP cells infected
with the PSAP-GFP reporter construct were plated in
6-well plate at 200,000 cells per plate. Cells were treated
with DMSO (vehicle control) or AEW541 (10 μM).
Treated cells and controls were stained using the Vybrant
Apoptosis Kit (catalog #V23200; Life Science) and
analyzed by FACS 24h after the treatments to assess cell
apoptosis and death in the PSA−/lo and PSA+ populations.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), Western
blotting (WB), and fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS)
qRT-PCR was performed using an ABI Prism
7900HT and the TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems).
The primers, probes, and assay conditions for other
molecules were designed by ABI with the following
information: PSA (Hs03063374_m1; assay number),
AR (Hs00907244_m1), b-actin (Hs99999903_ml), and
GAPDH (4326317E). For data analysis, raw counts
were normalized to the housekeeping gene averaged
for the same time point and condition (ΔCt). Counts are
reported as fold change relative to the untreated control
(2−ΔΔCt). For WB, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer
(25 μM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 μM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 1%
proteinase inhibitors (#P2850; Sigma). Protein lysates
were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred
to Whatman Western polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF)
membrane (#Z671088; Sigma), immunoblotted with
primary antibodies (Supplementary Table S1) followed
by appropriate secondary antibody and visualized using
the ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Kit (#RPN2132;
GE Healthcare). For FACS, cells were dissociated into
single-cell suspension using trypsin/EDTA and measured
for GFP+ percentages. In some experiments, we stained the
parent LNCaP and the LNCaP-CRPC cells with antibodies
to α2β1, CD44, and ABCG2 (1 mg/1x106 cells) for 30 min
on ice followed by washing and subsequent staining with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Time lapse microscopy
LNCaP cells freshly infected with the PSAP-GFP
reporter construct or, alternatively, infected LNCaP cells
treated with MDV3100 (10 μM) acutely or chronically for
5 months, were plated on glass-bottom dishes (Grenier BioOne), placed on the incubator stage of Nikon Biostation
Timelapse system, and maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2 and
> 95% humidity in RPMI medium supplemented with
10% FBS, 1 % Pen/Strep, and MDV3100 (10 μM). Phase
and GFP images were collected continuously with a 20X
objective lens at a 1-h interval for ~1 week. Data analysis
was performed using Nikon NIS-Elements software.

Candidate library drug screening

same amount of DMSO (final concentration at 0.1%,
v/w) without compounds was added. Column 12 was
reserved for a negative control (100% activity) and
prepared right after compound addition by aspirating 44
μL of medium, followed by dispensing 44 μL of Triton
X-100 (detergent). Assay plates were incubated at 37°C
for 72 h, after which cell viability was determined by
adding 10 μL of 10x AlamarBlue dye to assay plates
using a MicroFlo Select bulk dispenser (BioTek). After
incubating at 37°C for 4 h, both absorbance (570 nm)
and fluorescence intensity (Ex/Em = 530/590 nm) were
simultaneously measured in a Synergy H4 plate-reader
(BioTek). The z factor calculated according to the
equation 1 was over 0.9, demonstrating its robustness
for compound screening. A total of 752 compounds were
tested in triplicate. To normalize cell number variation
between wells of assay plates, total fluorescence intensity
of each well was divided by corresponding absorbance
and this normalized fluorescence intensity was used to
calculate inhibitory activity (equation 2). Compounds
showing over 40% activity were identified as hits and
further validated in multiple doses using the same assay.
For data analysis, z factor was calculated using equation
(1). Percent inhibition for the fluorescence signal was
calculated using equation (2).

To determine the sensitivity of our LNCaP-CRPC
cells to castration and other therapeutics, we performed
a “candidate” library drug screen in parental LNCaP
cells infected with PSAP-GFP, the three LNCaP-CRPC
sublines at two time points (i.e., 5 and 10.5 months),
and, for comparison, LNCaP-abl cells. The candidate
library contained 15 drugs and/or compounds (see Text
and Supplementary Table S2). Length of incubation time
and number of cells plated were optimized to achieve
the most accurate, reproducible response of cells to the
AlamarBlue assay (Life Technologies). Briefly, cells were
plated in 96-well black clear bottom plates (BD Falcon)
at 7x103 cells/well and allowed to recover for 48 h before
commencement of drug treatments. Candidate library
compounds were diluted via manufacturer’s instructions
and added to plates at three concentrations based on IC50
values. Cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle control) or
compounds for 72 h, after which AlamarBlue reagent was
added in an amount equal to 10% of the volume in the well
(20 μl). Cultures were incubated for 4 h. The cytotoxicity
was measured using spectrophotometry of fluorescence
(excitation 560 nm, emission 590 nm) using a BioTek
Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek). Percent difference in
reduction between treated and control cells was calculated
using the following formula: [FI 590 of test agent/ FI 590
of untreated control] x 100.

We also screened the parental LNCaP-GFP and
the LNCaP-CRPC cells against a collection of 752
inhibitors of >140 human kinases (Supplementary
Table  S3). Compound screening was performed at
the TTDDD core facility (Targeted Therapeutic Drug
Discovery Core) located at University of Texas-Austin
using its custom selected kinase-focused collection.
All liquid handling steps excluding AlamarBlue dye
dispensing were performed using JANUS automated
workstation (Perkin Elmer). LNCaP-CRPC cells were
trypsinized and re-suspended in RPMI medium. The
general screening protocol is as follows. Eighty eight μL
of cells were plated into 96 well flat clear-bottom black
plates (BD Falcon) at 7x103 cells/well and incubated
overnight at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2. Compound dilution was first prepared in separate
96 well plates by diluting 1.8 mL of compounds stock
solutions dissolved in 100 % DMSO (columns 2-11) or
DMSO only (column 1) into 19 mL of water to achieve
a final concentration of compound at 500 μM. 1.8 μL of
diluted compounds and pure DMSO were added through
columns 2-11 and column 1, respectively, into the assay
plates. The final concentrations of compound and DMSO
were 10 μM and 0.1%, respectively. Column  1 was
used for a positive control (i.e., 0% activity) where the
