ABSTRACT
The FDA-approved anti-DNA virus agent cidofovir (CDV) is being evaluated in
phase II/III clinical trials for the treatment of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated
tumors. However, previous observations had shown that CDV also inhibits the growth
of vascular tumors induced by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2)-transformed FGF2-TMAE cells. Here, we demonstrate that CDV inhibits metastasis induced by FGF2-driven,
virus-independent tumor cells. Pre-treatment of luciferase-expressing FGF2-T-MAE
cells with CDV reduced single cell survival and anchorage-independent growth in
vitro and lung metastasis formation upon intravenous inoculation into SCID mice.
This occurred in the absence of any effect on homing of FGF2-T-MAE cells to the
lungs and on the growth of subconfluent cell cultures or subcutaneous tumors in
mice. Accordingly, CDV protected against lung metastasis when given systemically
after tumor cell injection. Lung metastases in CDV-treated mice showed reduced Ki67
expression and increased nuclear accumulation of p53, indicating that CDV inhibits
metastasis by affecting single cell survival properties. The anti-metastatic potential of
CDV was confirmed on B16-F10 melanoma cells, both in zebrafish embryos and mice.
These findings suggest that CDV may have therapeutic potential as an anti-metastatic
agent and warrants further study to select those tumor types that are most likely to
benefit from CDV therapy.

INTRODUCTION

cells [10] and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
cells [11]. This effect was attributed, at least in part, to
inhibition of angiogenesis mediated by p53-dependent
reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
expression [10].
In keeping with these observations, CDV proved
active in patients with recurrent Epstein-Barr virusinduced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and is
increasingly being used off-label to treat a variety of
human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced premalignant and
malignant lesions [12-15]. In fact, intralesional CVD has
been one of the mainstays of adjuvant therapy in patients
with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) since
1998 [16]. Moreover, CDV has recently been evaluated
in phase II clinical trials for HPV-associated high grade

The nucleotide analogue cidofovir [(S)-1-(3hydroxy-2-phosphonyl-methoxypropyl)cytosine, CDV]
is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent approved (Vistide®)
for the treatment of cytomegalovirus-induced retinitis in
AIDS patients [1,2].
Besides its antiviral activity, CDV possesses potent
anti-tumor activity in various experimental models of
virus-associated tumors [3-8]. In vitro, CDV inhibits the
proliferation of HPV-positive (HPV+) cervical carcinoma
cells by accumulation of cells in the S-phase, induction of
apoptosis and stimulation of the tumor suppressor proteins
p53 and pRb [8,9]. Moreover, a synergistic effect of CDV
and radiation was observed in HPV18+ cervical carcinoma

cervical and vulvar carcinoma and showed promise for
topical treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade
(CIN) 2+ lesions [17].
Besides its virus-related antineoplastic activity,
increasing evidence indicates that CDV may show
therapeutic efficacy in cancer beyond the setting of viral
infection. Indeed, CDV inhibits intracranial glioblastoma
growth by promoting DNA double-strand breaks and
apoptosis following its incorporation into the DNA [18].
Also, CDV proved effective in the treatment of patients
with basal cell carcinoma [19] and cutaneous squamous
cell carcinoma [20].
Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) was one of the
first angiogenic factors to be described [21]. Over the
years the FGF2/FGF receptor (FGFR) system has been
shown to play a major role in angiogenesis, inflammation
and in the development and progression of angiogenic
diseases and cancer [22-24]. Moreover, accumulating
evidence indicates that FGF2 is involved in resistance of
tumor vascularization against VEGF inhibitor treatment.
Therefore, FGF2 and FGFRs have gained interest as
promising targets for drug development in cancer therapy
[25,26]. In this setting, we generated a stable oncogenic
FGF2-overexpressing
endothelial
(FGF2-T-MAE)
cell line able to induce highly vascularized tumors that
histologically resemble Kaposi’s sarcoma when grafted
in immunocompromised mice [4,27,28]. Thus, FGF2-TMAE cells represent an interesting model of FGF2-driven
tumor development and for assessing the efficacy of antiFGF2 therapeutic approaches. Notably, CDV inhibits the
growth of primary tumors induced by FGF2-T-MAE cells
that do not express viral oncogenes. The cytostatic and
pro-apoptotic activity of CDV in these cells was found to
be mediated by increased p53 protein levels and inhibition
of FGF2 expression [29]. Relevant to this point, CDV also
inhibits the in vivo growth of murine B16 melanoma cells
[30], a FGF2-dependent tumor cell line [26 and references
therein]. Accordingly, intralesional injection of CDV
has been shown to cause the regression of a cutaneous
metastasis in a melanoma patient [31].
Metastasis remains the primary cause of mortality
in cancer patients. This is mainly due to the fact that
micrometastases largely remain unidentified. Thus, the
identification and characterization of compounds able
to prevent the development of micrometastases and/
or metastatic colonization, remains a challenge [32,33].
Previous observations had shown that CDV exerts an antimetastatic activity in one experimental model involving
HPV+ cells [34]. In the present study, we show that CDV
inhibits the metastatic growth of virus-independent,
FGF2-driven FGF2-T-MAE and melanoma B16 tumors.
Evidence is provided that this is associated with the
inhibition of single cell survival properties of tumor cells.

CDV reduces single cell survival of F2T-luc2.9
cells
We previously showed that the cytostatic activity
of CDV in FGF2-T-MAE cells increases with decreasing
seeding density [29]. Therefore, we assessed whether
CDV affects the capacity of luciferase-expressing FGF2T-MAE cells (F2T-luc2.9 cells) to survive as single cells.
We first examined toxicity in subconfluent F2Tluc2.9 cell cultures. Cells were incubated with various
concentrations of CDV for 24 h, washed and grown in
fresh medium without compound for 5 days. Cell viability
was determined at different time points. As previously
shown for HPV+ cells (and due to the long half-life of
CDV), cytotoxicity of CDV increased with time, in
particular from 1 to 3 days after CDV treatment (Fig. 1A),
resulting in CC50 values (concentration that reduces the
number of living cells by 50%) that decreased from >100
µg/ml 24 h after CDV treatment to 71, 49 and 45 µg/ml
after 2, 3 and 6 days, respectively (Fig. 1B).
Next, F2T-luc2.9 cells, pretreated for 24 h with
different concentrations of CDV, were seeded as single
cells in the absence of CDV. Colony formation was
evaluated after 7 days. CDV significantly inhibited single
cell survival and growth (Fig. 1C) at concentrations that
did not inhibit subconfluent cultures, as reflected by the
reduced number of colonies and smaller colony size
(Fig. 1D) of cells pretreated with 10 or 20 µg/ml CDV.
At 50 µg/ml, no colonies could be detected, whereas this
concentration still allowed 50% survival in subconfluent
cultures (Fig. 1A). Additionally, we determined the effect
of CDV on detachment-free survival of F2T-luc2.9 cells
seeded on agarose. Again, CDV pretreatment (at 10 and
20 µg/ml) dose-dependently inhibited the clonogenic
capacity of the cells (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that
CDV may affect the survival of single cells in the blood
(in suspension) or after extravasation in the target organ.

CDV pretreatment inhibits lung metastasis of
F2T-luc2.9 cells without affecting primary tumor
growth
Prompted by these results we investigated whether
CDV inhibits the metastatic potential of F2T-luc2.9
cells after intravenous injection in SCID mice. This
experimental metastasis model recapitulates all postintravasation steps of tumor cell metastasis [35].
F2T luc2.9 cells were retained in the lungs within
1h after inoculation into the tail vein (Fig. 2A). The
luminescent signal, reflecting the amount of living tumor
cells in the lungs, progressively declined during the next
days, leaving a small number of viable cells that remained
4634

dormant for approximately 3 weeks. Next, disease
progression occurred, as indicated by the exponential
increase in luminescent signal in the lungs.
In order to evaluate the anti-metastatic properties
of CDV, F2T-luc2.9 cells were pretreated with 10 µg/
ml of CDV for 24 h, i.e. the lowest concentration that
inhibited single cell survival in vitro (Fig. 1C). Consistent
with the in vitro data, CDV pretreatment resulted in a
significant reduction in tumor cell survival in the lungs
compared with control cells. Indeed, the luminescent
signal decreased 8-fold from day 0 to day 5 after injection
for control cells versus 16-fold for CDV-treated cells

(Fig. 2A). Moreover, outgrowth of the surviving cells into
macrometastases proceeded more slowly for CDV-treated
cells, the luminescent signal increasing more than 100fold from day 19 to 36 for control cells versus 13-fold for
CDV-treated cells. This resulted in a significantly reduced
weight of harvested lungs at the end of the experiment
(Fig. 2C).
CDV was previously shown to inhibit the homing
of HPV+ cells to the lungs by inhibition of CXCR4
expression and signaling [34]. However, one hour after
cell inoculation equal numbers of luciferase-expressing
tumor cells were observed in the lungs of control and

F2T-luc2.9 cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM)
components collagen I, laminin, or fibronectin or to an

endothelial cell layer (data not shown). Together, these
data indicate that CDV does not influence initial retention/
homing of F2T-luc2.9 cells in the lungs.

To further investigate the growth potential of lungarrested tumor cells, lungs were harvested at different time
points after cell injection. Then, single cell suspensions
were generated and allowed to grow for 2 weeks in
hygromycin-containing medium selective for F2T-luc2.9
cells (Fig. 2D). As anticipated, no difference was observed
in the number of colonies obtained from lungs containing
control or CDV-pretreated cells shortly after injection
(30 min). However, the colony-forming capacity of
CDV-pretreated cells appeared to be reduced when lungs
were harvested 24 h after cell injection; this effect was
statistically significant for cells isolated 7 days after cell
injection.
On this basis, to assess whether CDV pretreatment
affects the intrinsic growth potential of F2T-luc2.9 cells,
CDV-pretreated cells (10 µg/ml, 24 h) were injected
subcutaneously in SCID mice. At variance with the
inhibitory effect exerted by CDV pretreatment on the
development of F2T-luc2.9 lung metastases, no significant
difference in subcutaneous tumor growth could be
observed between control and CDV-treated cells (Fig. 2E,
F). Accordingly, the weight of the primary subcutaneous
tumors harvested 3 weeks after cell injection was not
different in the two groups (Fig. 2G). Thus, pretreatment
with a low dose of CDV does not affect the intrinsic
growth of subcutaneous tumor grafts generated by F2Tluc2.9 cells but hampers single cell survival in vitro and
metastatic growth in vivo.

microscopically detectable lesions in the lungs of CDVtreated mice, indicating that the development of lung
metastases was delayed, but not completely prevented, by
systemic CDV treatment.
In a second set of experiments, mice were inoculated
with a high amount of cells to assess the effect of systemic
CDV treatment on animal survival. As shown in Fig. 4A,
control mice died 31 ± 2 days after tumor cell inoculation.
In contrast, 60% or 29% of the animals were still alive at
day 57 when CDV treatment was initiated 1 h or 2 days
after cell inoculation and continued till the end of the
experiment. At this time point, surviving animals showed
signs of progressing illness and were euthanized. Thus,
CDV protects against lung metastasis when treatment
is delayed till 2 days post tumor cell injection, but the
inhibitory effect was less pronounced compared with the
early treatment group (Fig. 4), suggesting that CDV may
act at different steps of the metastatic process after tumor
cell homing.

Systemic treatment with CDV impairs lung
metastasis of F2T-luc2.9 cells
Next, we examined whether CDV also protects
against lung metastasis when given systemically after
tumor cell injection, i.e. in a therapeutic treatment setting.
The anti-metastatic activity of CDV was evaluated at 150
mg/kg i.p., once weekly, a concentration that suppresses
FGF2-T-MAE primary tumor growth without eliciting
systemic toxicity [4]. When treatment was started 1 h
after cell inoculation and sustained for 6 weeks, CDV
significantly reduced tumor cell survival and outgrowth
in the lungs (Fig. 3A), resulting in a markedly reduced
metastatic burden and lung weight (470 ± 220 mg
versus 170 ± 23 mg for control and CVD-treated mice,
respectively) (Fig. 3A-C). Macroscopically, lung tumors
were detected in all control animals whereas 83% of
CDV-treated mice appeared tumor-free (Fig. 3D). Also,
Western blot analysis performed on lung homogenates
from control and 3F2T.luc2-injected animals harvested
5 weeks after cell injection showed a high expression of
FGF2 isoforms, an index of the presence of F2T-luc2.9
cell-derived metastases in control lungs. In contrast, low
levels of FGF2 were detectable in the lungs from CDVtreated animals (Fig. 3E). Histological analysis confirmed
these observations (Fig. 3F) and showed the presence of

lung metastases from mice that were i.v. injected with
untreated F2T-luc2.9 cells (control), CDV-pretreated cells
or naïve cells followed by systemic CDV treatment. Five
weeks after cell injection, metastases of various sizes
were detected throughout control lungs (Fig. 5A). Large
(> 1 mm) and medium-size (200 µm-1 mm) metastases
showed high expression of the proliferation marker Ki67,
both in the center and at the tumor rim, and were highly
vascularized, whereas micrometastases (<200 µm) stained

CDV has been shown to reduce FGF2-T-MAE
tumor growth by inducing apoptosis via the upregulation
of p53 [4,29]. Thus we reasoned that similar mechanisms
might be responsible for the anti-metastatic activity of the
drug.
Immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5) was performed on

Figure 5: Immunohistochemical analysis of F2T-luc2.9 cell-induced lung metastases. Immunohistochemical analysis was

performed on lung metastases from mice collected 5 weeks after i.v. injection of either untreated F2T-luc2.9 cells (control), untreated cells

positive for Ki67 (Fig. 5B, C) but appeared to contain
fewer blood vessels or were located perivascularly. The
tumor suppressor protein p53 was expressed either in the
cytoplasm only (Fig. 5D) or in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
In the group of animals injected with CDV-pretreated
cells, few vascularized metastases (1-3 per lung section)
were evident. Even though most metastases expressed
Ki67, Ki67-negative metastases were characterized by p53
nuclear localization (Fig. 5D). Similarly, metastases in the
lungs of CDV-treated mice grafted with naïve F2T-luc2.9
cells were low in number (1-3 per lung section) and smallto medium sized (Fig. 5A). Also in this group, mediumsized lesions did not appear different from control lesions.

However, at variance with the other experimental groups,
the lungs of CDV-treated mice were characterized by the
presence of avascular micrometastases as well as of small
lesions that did not express Ki67 (Fig. 5C). Again, p53
was predominantly located in the nucleus of tumor cells in
all Ki67-negative lesions in this group (Fig. 5D).
Thus, in keeping with our previous in vitro
observations on FGF2-T-MAE cells [29], CDV may affect
the number of F2T-luc2.9 metastases and their growth in
vivo by reducing Ki67 expression and increasing nuclear
accumulation of p53.

CDV inhibits lung metastasis of B16-F10
melanoma cells in zebrafish and mice

their injection in the bloodstream of mice [36,37] or
zebrafish embryos [38]. On this basis, given the prominent
role of FGF2 in tumor progression and metastatic activity
of these cells [26 and references therein], we investigated
whether the anti-metastatic potential of CDV could be
extended also to these virus-independent tumor cells.

FGF2-dependent B16-F10 melanoma cells represent
a prototypic model of experimental metastasis following

In a first set of experiments, DsRed-B16-F10
melanoma cells were injected into the blood circulation
of zebrafish embryos at 48 hpf. After 24 h, embryos were
transferred in fish water in the absence or in the presence
of 100 µg/ml of CDV and the growth of micrometastases
in the tail vascular plexus was followed. As shown in Fig.
6, CDV treatment results in a significant reduction of the
size of DsRed-labelled micrometastases when assessed
5 days after cell injection. Of note, CDV did not exert
any evident toxic effect on the development of zebrafish
embryos when compared to vehicle-treated animals (data
not shown).
Next, the effect of CDV on the metastatic activity
of B16-F10 melanoma cells was assessed in mice. In
accordance with the data obtained with F2T.luc2.9 cells,
pretreatment of B16-F10-luc2 cells with CDV abrogated
lung metastasis after i.v. injection (Fig. 7A-C) without
affecting primary subcutaneous tumor growth (Fig. 7D-G).

were shown to correlate with poor clinical outcome [4749]. In melanoma, FGF2 upregulation was found to be
accompanied by the expression of FGFRs that triggers
an autocrine loop of activation required for melanoma
growth and survival [22,26,50,51]. Here we show that
the injection of DsRed-B16-F10 melanoma cells into
the blood circulation of zebrafish embryos results in
the growth of micrometastases within 5 days after cell
injection. Addition of 100 µg/ml of CDV to the fish
water resulted in a significant reduction in the growth of
micrometastases, without any evident toxic effect on the
development of the embryos. Also, pretreatment of B16F10-luc2 cells with CDV abrogated single cell survival
in vitro (data not shown) and lung metastasis after i.v.
injection in mice, without affecting primary subcutaneous
tumor growth. The anti-metastatic activity of CDV was
not limited to B16 melanoma cells. Indeed, our data
demonstrate the capacity of the compound to affect
also single cell survival of FGF2-dependent 3F2T.luc2
tumor cells and their capacity to induce lung metastases
following i.v. injection in immunocompromised animals.
These observations pave the way for further studies
about the anti-cancer activity of CDV in different FGF2dependent tumors.
Metastasis is a complex multistep process that
involves (i) the detachment of tumor cells from the
primary tumor, (ii) trans-endothelial cell migration, (iii)
transport of the tumor cells through the blood, (iv) tumor
cell arrest in a target organ, (v) extravasation into the tissue
and (vi) outgrowth of the secondary tumor [reviewed in
32,33]. Thus, compounds that interfere with tumor cell
invasion, detachment-free survival, angiogenesis and
resistance to apoptosis may inhibit metastasis. In vitro
experiments indicate that CDV does not affect F2Tluc2.9 cell migration or adhesion to the ECM components
collagen I, laminin, or fibronectin or to an endothelial cell
layer (data not shown). Amine [34] demonstrated that
pretreatment of HPV16+ cells with CDV reduces tumor
cell metastasis by inhibition of E6 and E7 viral oncogene
expression, leading to decreased CXCR4 levels and
reduced homing of the cells to the lungs after i.v. injection.
However, we found that CXCR4 protein expression at the
cell surface was nearly undetectable both in control and
CDV-treated F2T-luc2.9 cells, ruling out the possibility
that the anti-metastatic action exerted by CDV on these
cells may depend on CXCR4 activity. Accordingly, our
in vivo observations clearly indicate that CDV does not
interfere with F2T-luc2.9 cell homing to the lungs.
CDV reduces the in vitro survival of single F2Tluc2.9 cells both when attached to the substratum or in
suspension. This occurred at compound concentrations
that did not affect the survival of subconfluent cell
cultures. Moreover, pretreatment of F2T-luc2.9 cells with
CDV reduced lung metastasis after i.v. injection but did
not affect the growth of a subcutaneous primary tumor,
pointing to a specific effect of CDV at the single cell level.

DISCUSSION
Experience with the off-label use of the nucleotide
analogue CDV and recent clinical trials indicate that CDV
holds great promise as anti-cancer agent for the treatment
of high-grade HPV+ carcinomas [16,17]. While CDV
preferentially acts on E6/E7 viral oncogene-expressing
cells [9], a recent study showed that the compound also
inhibits primary glioma growth in human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV)-infected as well as in non-infected patients [18],
indicating that this compound may exert anti-tumor effects
also in virus-independent neoplasms. Indeed, CDV proved
effective in the treatment of patients affected by basal cell
carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [19,20].
Moreover, CDV reduces the growth of primary murine
B16 melanoma tumor grafts [30] and of Kaposi’s sarcomalike tumors induced by murine FGF2-overexpressing
FGF2-T-MAE cells [4,27,28].
Thus far, the anti-metastatic activity of CDV had
been demonstrated only in one experimental model
involving HPV+ cells [34]. Here, we provide novel
evidence that CDV inhibits experimental lung metastases
induced by virus-independent FGF2-T-MAE-derived
3F2T.luc2 tumor cells and B16-F10 melanoma cells, the
growth of both cell lines relying on an autocrine activation
by FGF2 [4,26].
FGF2 activates FGF receptors (FGFRs)
on endothelial cells, resulting in increased tumor
vascularization and dissemination of metastatic cells [22].
Accordingly, FGF2 has been shown to play an important
role in the pathology of tumors of endothelial cell origin,
such as hemangiomas and Kaposi’s sarcoma [39-41].
Moreover, levels of circulating FGF2 were suggested to
have prognostic value in hematological malignancies,
lung cancer, head and neck cancer and melanoma [22,4246]. In other tumor types, such as gastric and esophageal
cancer and pediatric glioma, intratumoral levels of FGF2

It is well established that the majority of tumor cells die
during the first days after arrest in the target organ [52,53].
We found that the massive tumor cell death that occurs in
the lungs from day 0 till day 7 after i.v. injection was even
more pronounced when F2T-luc2.9 cells were pretreated
with CDV and correlated with the reduced colony-forming
capacity of these cells when recovered from the lungs
7 days after injection. Together, these data suggest that
CDV may affect the survival of single tumor cell colonies
or micrometastases in the lung microenvironment [54].
However, despite the pro-apoptotic properties of CDV
[4,5,29], we failed to detect apoptotic tumor cells in the
lungs of F2T-luc2.9 cell-injected animals 3 and 7 days
after grafting (data not shown). This could be due to the
paucity of tumor cells present in the lungs at these time
points or the fact that apoptotic cells had already been
phagocytized and cleared.
The progression from a small avascular nodule to
an aggressively growing secondary tumor requires the
formation of an intratumoral network of blood vessels
[32,55]. CDV caused >90% reduction in the number of
F2T-luc2.9 cell-derived lung metastases with complete
inhibition of large-size metastases, suggesting that the
compound inhibits both the survival of micrometastases
as well as macrometastasis outgrowth. Moreover, whereas
control metastases were all well vascularized, avascular
micrometastases were detectable in the lungs of CDVtreated mice. Accordingly, CDV was shown to reduce the
expression of pro-angiogenic FGF2 in F2T-luc2.9 cells in
vitro [29]. In addition, weekly CDV treatment, that results
in a nearly continuous exposure to the drug due to its long
half-life [56], was able to maintain micrometastases in a
dormant state, as shown by the absence of Ki67 expression
in (some of) these lesions. Notably, all Ki67-negative
lesions showed predominant nuclear staining of p53,
whereas p53 was localized solely in the cytoplasm or in
the cytoplasm and nucleus in Ki67-positive metastases.
Increased nuclear p53 is likely to result in cell cycle
arrest [57], as indicated by the absence of Ki67 staining in
these lesions. These data suggest that the anti-tumor/antimetastatic activity of CDV might be limited to tumors in
which downstream p53 signaling is unaffected.
The p53 pathway has been identified as one of the
main targets for CDV also in HPV+ tumors in which
increased p53 levels are linked to reduced expression
of the viral oncogene E6 [9,10]. Further studies will be
required to identify the molecular mechanisms linking
CDV treatment to increased p53 activity in virusindependent tumors.
Tumor metastases remain the main cause of death
in cancer patients, mainly due to late diagnosis and the
lack of efficient anti-metastatic drugs. The present study
shows for the first time that the FDA-approved antiviral
agent CDV inhibits lung metastasis of virus-independent
FGF2-driven tumor cells. The concept of using existing
drugs for novel applications is very attractive given
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that treatment can be developed fast and with relatively
low costs [58-61]. Developing a new drug can take 10
years or more and costs in excess of 1 billion dollars.
Moreover, despite increasing efforts and money being
put into research, the number of new drugs approved
remains constant. Repurposing old compounds has proven
successful in the past and is gaining in popularity [62-65].
In particular, AZT (azidothymidine), a failed anticancer
drug, was the first antiviral approved for HIV/AIDS in
1987 [66]. Conversely, the nucleoside analogue Gemzar®
(gemcitabine) originally developed as an antiviral agent
is now being used to treat pancreatic cancer [67]. Our
findings suggest that CDV may have therapeutic potential
as an anti-metastatic agent and warrant further studies to
select those tumor types that are most likely to benefit
from CDV therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cidofovir [(CDV, Vistide®] was obtained from
Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA)

Cell cultures
FGF2-T-MAE cells are murine endothelial cells that
express high levels of the Mr 18,000, Mr 22,000 and Mr
24,000 molecular weight isoforms of FGF2 [27]. These
cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified minimum
essential medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.,
Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10 mM Hepes (Life
Technologies), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) , 1 mM
sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies) and 500 µg/ml
geneticin (Invitrogen). F2T-luc2.9 cells were engineered
by selecting the brightest clone of FGF2-T-MAE cells
transfected with enhanced firefly luciferase (Fluc,
Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands) under hygromycin
growth conditions (Invitrogen), as described [68]. B16F10-luc2 murine melanoma cells expressing Fluc (Perkin
Elmer, Zaventem, Belgium) were maintained in DMEM,
supplemented with 10% FBS.

Cytotoxicity
Cytotoxicity of CDV was evaluated by the MTS
method. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at 10,000 cells per cm2. After overnight incubation at
37°C, CDV (10, 20, 50 or 100 µg/ml) was added for 24
h. Next, the cells were washed and incubated with fresh
medium containing 10% FBS for another 24, 48 or 120
h. To determine the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50),
the medium was removed and 90 μl medium plus 10 μl
MTS/PMS (Promega) were added to each well. After
an incubation period of 2 h at 37 °C, the optical density
of each well was determined at 498 nm in a microplate
reader.

Anchorage-independent growth

Clonogenic assay for viability of lung-arrested
tumor cells

F2T-luc2.9 cells were grown in culture flasks and
pretreated with different concentrations of CDV (50, 20
or 10 µg/ml) for 24 h. Next, the cells were trypsinized and
counted. 5.104 cells were suspended in 2 ml of medium
containing 0.3% agar and applied onto 2 ml presolidified
0.6% agar in 6-well plates in the absence of CDV. Medium
was replaced twice weekly. After 2 weeks of incubation,
cell colonies were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in
methanol and counted.

106 F2T-luc2.9 cells (treated or untreated with CDV)
were injected i.v. in SCID mice. At different time points
after cell injection (30 min, 24 h, 7 days) lungs were
removed, minced and incubated in DMEM containing
0.25% collagenase type 4 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 300 units
DNase I for 1 h at 37°C with agitation. The cells were then
passed through a 40 µm cell strainer to collect a singlecell suspension. A total of 5 x 104 lung-derived cells were
plated into a 10-cm tissue culture dish. Colonies were
stained and counted 14 days later.

Single cell survival

Primary tumor growth in mice

F2T-luc2.9 cells were treated and seeded as
described above. Next, 300 cells were seeded in 6-well
plates in the absence of CDV. After 7 days cell colonies
were stained and counted.

SCID mice were inoculated s.c. with 200 µl of
serum-free DMEM containing 106 F2T.luc2.9 cells
(untreated or pretreated with 10 µg/ml CDV) or 30,000
B16-F10-luc2 cells (untreated or pretreated with 10 or
50 µg/ml CDV). The mice were imaged at regular time
intervals to assess the growth of the luciferase-positive
tumor cells. At the end of the experiment, the tumors were
excised and weighed.

Animals
Female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)
mice, weighing about 20 g were used for all experiments.
The animals were bred at the animal facility of the Rega
Institute. All studies were done in compliance with the
ethical guidelines for animal welfare of the KU Leuven
(P028/2011).

Histological and immunohistochemical analyses
At indicated time points, mice were euthanized by
i.p. injection of pentobarbital. Lungs were washed with
PBS via intracardiac perfusion and fixed intratracheally
with 4% paraformaldehyde. Dissected lungs were
fixed overnight at room temperature and stored in PBS
until paraffin sectioning. Paraffin-embedded sections
were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a
decreasing concentration of alcohol. Four micron sections
were prepared and subsequently stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E). The presence of metastatic nodules in
the lungs was evaluated microscopically.
For immunohistochemistry, heat-induced antigen
retrieval was done in citrate buffer (pH 6) using a
microwave. Sections were permeabilized for 30 min at
room temperature with 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in
PBS containing 0.5% BSA, washed with PBS and blocked
with 5% goat serum (Sigma) in PBS containing 0.5% BSA
for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, sections
were incubated overnight at 4°C with a rabbit anti-CD31
(5 µg/ml, abcam), rat anti-Ki67 (1 µg/ml, eBioscience) or
mouse anti-p53 (4 µg/ml, Novus Biologicals, Cambridge,
UK). After washing with PBS containing 0.01% Tween20,
sections were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with
an Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular
probes), Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse antibody
(Molecular probes) and Dylight 650 conjugated goat antirat antibody (Thermofisher). Sections were washed with

Metastasis assays
Intravenous injection of tumor cells has been used as
an experimental model to investigate tumor cell metastasis
in mice [35]. Thus, 106 (2.106 for mortality experiments)
F2T-luc2.9 cells were injected into the tail vein of SCID
mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment with CDV (150 mg/
kg) was started 1 h after cell injection and continued once
weekly. The same volume of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) was given to control mice. Alternatively, F2Tluc2.9 cells were pretreated with 10 µg/ml of CDV for 24
h. Next, 106 cells (untreated or pretreated with CDV) were
injected into the tail vein of SCID mice.
B16-F10-luc2 cells were pretreated with 10 or 50
µg/ml of CDV for 24 h. Next, 30,000 cells were injected
into the tail vein of SCID mice.
The mice were imaged at regular time intervals to
assess the growth of the luciferase-positive tumor cells.
Before imaging, the mice were injected subcutaneously
(s.c.) with 200 µl of a 15 mg/ml luciferin solution in PBS.
Images were captured by the IVIS spectrum imaging
system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA) and
analyzed using the LivingImage software (Caliper Life
Sc). At the end of the experiment (as indicated in Results),
the lungs were weighed and processed for further analysis.

Statistical analyses

PBS containing 0.01% Tween20 and incubated with 2 µg/
ml Hoechst (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. After
washing, sections were mounted with 1% n-propyl gallate
and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescent microscopic
analysis was done with an Axiovert 200 M inverted
microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany), using a PlanApochromat 20x/0.8 objective. Pictures were taken with
an AxioCam MRm camera and processed with AxioVision
Release 4.6 software (Zeiss).

Two-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine the
statistical significance of the data; p values < 0.05 were
considered significant.

Western blot analysis of lung samples
Homogenized lungs were lysed on ice in 500 µl
lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mM NaCl,
2 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol,
1 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mM
glycerophosphate and 10 µg/ml leupeptin]. Lysates were
cleared by centrifugation and the protein concentration
was determined. SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis of the
cell lysates were performed as described [29]. After
electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to pretreated
Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes
(Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were incubated
for 1h at room temperature in blocking buffer (5 % non-fat
dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween) and subsequently
for 12 h at 4°C in blocking buffer with primary antibodies
raised against β-actin (1/5000, Sigma) or FGF2 (clone FB8, 1/5000, Sigma). After washing, the membranes were
incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse: 1/2000 or
anti-rabbit: 1/4000, Dako) in blocking buffer for 25 min
at room temperature. Next, the membranes were washed
extensively. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by
chemiluminescence (ECLplus, Bio-Rad). Samples were
collected from 3 independent experiments.
