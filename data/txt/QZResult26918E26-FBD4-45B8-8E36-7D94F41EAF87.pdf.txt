Abstract
In 1956, Otto Warburg proposed that the origin of cancer cells
was closely linked to a permanent respiratory defect that
bypassed the Pasteur effect (i.e., the inhibition of anaerobic
fermentation by oxygen). Since then, permanent defects in
oxygen consumption that could explain the dependence of
cancer cells on aerobic glycolysis have not been identified.
Here, we show that under normoxic conditions exposure of
leukemia cells to bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stromal
cells (MSC) promotes accumulation of lactate in the culture
medium and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential
(#WM) in both cell types. Notably, the consumption of
glucose was not altered in cocultures, suggesting that the
accumulation of lactate was the result of reduced pyruvate
metabolism. Interestingly, the decrease in #WM was mediated
by mitochondrial uncoupling in leukemia cells and was
accompanied by increased expression of uncoupling protein
2 (UCP2). HL60 cells fail to increase UCP2 expression, are not
uncoupled after coculture, and do not exhibit increased
aerobic glycolysis, whereas small interfering RNA–mediated
suppression of UCP2 in OCI-AML3 cells reversed mitochondrial uncoupling and aerobic glycolysis elicited by MSC. Taken
together, these data suggest that microenvironment activation
of highly conserved mammalian UCPs may facilitate the
Warburg effect in the absence of permanent respiratory
impairment. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5198–205]

Introduction
In an article published in 1956, Otto Warburg presented a lucid
hypothesis that stated that the respiration of cancer cells was
damaged and that this resulted in their proglycolytic phenotype
even in the presence of oxygen (1). The abrogation of the Pasteur
effect (the inhibition of lactate generation in the presence of
oxygen) in tumors became known as the Warburg effect, and for
several decades, the search for permanent, transmissible injuries to
mitochondrial respiration that could support Warburg’s hypothesis
has not yielded conclusive results. In hindsight, it is noteworthy
that in his seminal article Warburg credited Feodor Lynen for first
suggesting that uncoupling respiration to the formation of ATP
could also result in the reversal of the Pasteur effect (1, 2), and in

this scenario, respiratory damage need not be an absolute
requirement. Lynen’s hypothesis was based in part on the 1936
report by Ronzoni and Ehrenfest (3) who first showed in isolated
frog muscle that the prototypical uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol
could abrogate the Pasteur effect in a dose-dependent manner.
More recent observations (4) have confirmed the reversal of the
Pasteur effect by 2,4-dinitrophenol in human cells and have also
shown that in a cell context-dependent manner, albeit this agent
produces a rapid increase in oxygen consumption, chronic
exposure may not result in increased demand for oxygen. This
key finding suggests that mitochondrial uncoupling could indeed
mimic the Warburg effect in the absence of permanent,
transmissible alterations to the oxidative capacity of cells.
Interestingly, mitochondrial uncoupling occurs physiologically
during cold acclimation in mammals and is mediated by
uncoupling proteins (UCP; refs. 5, 6). UCPs are mitochondrial inner
membrane proteins that short circuit the electrochemical gradient
created by the mitochondrial respiratory chain by sustaining an
inducible proton conductance (6). UCP1 was the first UCP identified
and shown to play a role in energy dissipation as heat in
mammalian brown fat (5, 7). Additional UCPs have been identified
in humans (UCP2, UCP3, and UCP4), and although all promote
partial mitochondrial uncoupling, their varied tissue distribution
and regulation suggests that they serve distinct physiologic roles
possibly unrelated to maintenance of core body temperature (6, 8).
For instance, recent work has shown that UCP2 can decrease
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria, protect
against cell death, and promote microenvironmental thermogenesis
in the central nervous system (9). Interestingly, UCP2 differs from
UCP1 in that it requires an activation step to sustain proton
conductance, and it may not conduct protons per se, but rather
fatty acid anions, albeit the nature of the proton conductance of
UCP2 remains controversial (10, 11).
Gatenby and Gawlinski (12) have recently suggested that the
proglycolytic phenotype of solid tumors is a result of environmental selection and imparts tumor cells with survival advantages in
the hypoxic and inflammatory conditions present in premalignant
lesions. Hypoxia alone can also promote glycolysis via the
activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (13); however, recent
evidence suggests that, in the absence of growth factor signaling,
hematopoietic cells fail to express this transcription factor (14).
This key finding indicates that, at least for hematopoietic cells,
additional microenvironmental cues are essential for the establishment of the proglycolytic metabolism. Because the bone
marrow microenvironment is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of leukemia (15–17), we decided to investigate if bone
marrow–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) could activate
aerobic glycolysis in leukemia cells. Our investigations revealed
that exposure of leukemia cells to MSC resulted in increased

The Warburg Effect in Leukemia-Stroma Cocultures

accumulation of lactate in the culture medium suggestive of the
Warburg effect. Most notably, the increased proglycolytic phenotype was accompanied by decreased mitochondrial membrane
potential (DWM) in the leukemic cells, a result of mitochondrial
uncoupling promoted by the activation of a highly conserved,
energy dissipating protein, UCP2. These results are the first to show
that MSCs promote the Warburg effect in leukemia cells and that
this phenomenon is mediated in part via activation of mitochondrial UCPs.

Sigma. MSCs were obtained from bone marrow samples and cultured at a
density of 1  104 to 5  104/cm2 in Mesenpro medium (Invitrogen) until
seeded as feeder layers at 5  104/1.9 cells per well in a 24-well plate in RPMI
1640 16 h before addition of 2.5  105 (TF1-RAS and TF1-SRC) or 5  105
(OCI-AML3, MOLM13, and HL60) leukemia cells in 1 mL of fresh RPMI 1640.
For all experiments, the viability of cell cultures was quantitated in a Vi-Cell
Cell Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter). Only cultures displaying >90%
viability were used for further metabolic measurements.

Materials and Methods

Lactate generation and polarographic measurements of oxygen consumption were carried out as previously described (19). Fluorometric
oxygen measurements using the BD Oxygen Biosensor plates were carried
out as previously described (20).

Cell Lines, Chemicals, and Biochemicals
OCI-AML3, MOLM13, HL60, TF1-RAS, and TF1-SRC cells were maintained
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FCS, 1% glutamine, and 100 units/mL
penicillin in a 37jC incubator containing 5% CO2. TF1-RAS and TF1-SRC are
stable clones of the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor–
dependent cell line TF1 that express h-RAS or v-SRC oncogenes and are
growth factor independent (18). All experiments unless stated otherwise were
carried out at a cell density of 250,000 to 500,000/mL. The Amplex Red
Glucose/Glucose Oxidase kit, 2-NBDG, and JC-1 were obtained from
Molecular Probes. Total OXPHOS detection antibody kit was obtained from
Mitosciences. UCP antibodies (1–4) were obtained from Millipore. Oligomycin and carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) were obtained from

then harvested by trypsinization followed by one wash in cold PBS. Cells
were then resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 1:100 anti-CD90
allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated antibody (BD Biosciences) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were washed once with ice-cold PBS and
analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using a
488-nm argon and a 633-nm HeNe laser. The proportion of CD90-positive or
negative cells (MSC) was quantitated as % cells, and the 2-NBDG uptake
was presented as mean fluorescence intensity.

Ratiometric Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane
Potential
A solution of 5 mg/mL of JC-1 in formamide was diluted 1:100 in
prewarmed medium with vigorous vortexing and further diluted 1:100
directly on cell cultures 15 min before harvesting. Leukemia-MSC cocultures
were harvested by trypsinization followed by one wash in PBS. Leukemiaonly cultures were similarly processed. After collection, cells were washed
once in PBS and incubated for 5 to 10 min at room temperature with antiCD90 APC-conjugated antibody in PBS. DWM was then quantitated by flow
cytometry as previously described (21).

Western Blot Analysis
After appropriate treatments, MSC-leukemia cocultures were collected
by trypsinization, washed twice in PBS, and then resuspended in PBS with
1:100 of anti-CD90 APC-conjugated antibody. Leukemia-only cultures were
identically processed. MSC and leukemia cells were then isolated by

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and collected in PBS in a chilled
FACSAria (Becton Dickinson). Cell extracts were then generated and
immunoblotted as previously described (19).

Small Interfering RNA Transfection
Silencing of UCP2 gene expression in leukemic cells was achieved by the
small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique. ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool
human UCP2 short interfering RNAs were obtained from Dharmacon.
Nonspecific control pool containing four pooled nonspecific siRNA
duplexes was also used as a negative control. Transfection of leukemic
cells was carried out by electroporation using the Nucleofection System
(Amaxa), as previously described (22).

Results
Leukemia-MSC cocultures exhibit increased aerobic glycolysis. Our investigation started by monitoring the accumulation of
lactate in the medium of leukemia cell lines cultured alone or on a
feeder layer of primary bone marrow–derived MSC under normoxic
conditions. For all of our experiments, leukemia cells (2.5  105 to
5.0  105/mL) were cultured with feeder layers of MSC (5  104/mL)
for 48 h. Exposure of TF1-RAS, TF1-SRC, OCI-AML3, and MOLM13
leukemia cell lines to a MSC feeder layer resulted in increased
accumulation of lactate in the culture medium, whereas no increase

was seen in HL60-MSC cocultures (Fig. 1A). Although the source of
the lactate cannot be determined a priori due to the presence of two
cell types, the results in Fig. 1B indicate that, under our
experimental conditions, MSC feeder layers generate <1 mmol/L,
suggesting that a very large increase in lactate generation from
these cells would be necessary to account for the observed
differences. It is noteworthy that, under these experimental
conditions, TF1-RAS and TF1-SRC, but not any of the other cell
lines, proliferated slightly more when in coculture with MSC,
whereas MSC proliferation was moderately inhibited by all leukemia
cell lines tested (data not shown). Notably, monitoring glucose levels
in the culture medium revealed no differences in the amount of
glucose consumed by leukemia-MSC cocultures (Fig. 1C), and
likewise, monitoring the uptake of the fluorescent glucose derivative
2-NBDG by flow cytometry shows that neither OCI-AML3 nor
TF1-RAS cells markedly altered their uptake of 2-NBDG while grown
on MSC feeder layers (Fig. 1D). Similar observations were made in
TF1-SRC and MOLM13 cells (data not shown). In contrast, as shown
in Fig. 1D, hypoxia significantly increased 2-NBDG uptake in
OCI-AML3 cells cultured alone and markedly enhanced the uptake
in both cell types cultured with MSC, suggesting that under our
experimental conditions limiting oxygen concentrations, but not
coculture, increase the entry of glucose into leukemic cells. In
addition, the uptake of 2-NBDG by MSCs was moderately reduced in
coculture with TF1-RAS but unaffected in OCI-AML3 coculture
(data not shown). These observations suggest that the increase in
lactate levels in leukemia-MSC coculture reflects a decrease in the
amount of pyruvate that enters the Krebs cycle rather than an
increased use of glucose.
MSCs induce mitochondrial uncoupling in leukemia cells.
Because our results indicate that the mitochondrial metabolism of
pyruvate may be compromised in leukemia cocultures, we decided
to investigate mitochondrial membrane potential (DWM) by flow
cytometry using the ratiometric probe JC-1. As shown in Fig. 2A,
OCI-AML3 cells show significantly decreased DWM after 24 h of
coculture with MSC, suggesting that their mitochondria either have
decreased proton extrusion capacity or have increased their proton
conductance. In contrast, HL60 cells do not markedly alter their
DWM when in coculture (Fig. 2B), albeit as shown in Fig. 2C both
HL60 and OCI-AML3 cells induce depolarization of MSC mitochondria. This key observation further suggests that although MSC
mitochondrial function is altered by exposure to leukemia cells, it
is the decreased entry of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle of leukemia
cells that may account in large part for the increased generation of
lactate in coculture supernatants.
To determine if a generalized defect in respiration is the
underlying cause for the decrease in DWM in leukemia cells in
coculture, we monitored oxygen consumption fluorometrically in a
96-well plate format using the BD Oxygen Biosensor System. As
shown in Fig. 3A, oxygen consumption in OCI-AML3 cocultures
was nearly identical to oxygen consumption in leukemia cells
alone, suggesting that the decrease in DWM was not a result of
reduced oxygen consumption. Similar results were obtained using
polarographic oxygen consumption techniques (Fig. 3B). As was
the case for lactate generation under our experimental conditions,
MSC feeder layers alone consumed negligible amounts of oxygen.
Additionally, as shown in Fig. 3C, there was no difference in
expression of oxidative phosphorylation complexes in OCI-AML3
cells cocultured for 48 h with MSC, suggesting that mitochondrial
mass is not affected. Because the above observations suggest that
leukemia cells maintain the ability to reduce oxygen, we postulated

www.aacrjournals.org

that the loss of DWM could be a result of increased proton leakage
(i.e., uncoupling). To test if leukemia mitochondria may be
uncoupled in coculture, we examined the response of DWM to
oligomycin. Oligomycin binds to the F0 subunits 9 and 6 of complex
V (ATP synthase), resulting in intramitochondrial ATP hydrolysis,
uncoupled proton flux, and decreased DWM (23, 24). As shown in
Fig. 4A, OCI-AML3 cells cultured on MSC feeder layers are more
resistant to the loss of DWM in response to oligomycin treatment,

mass in leukemia cells. A, OCI-AML3 cells (5.0  105/mL) were cultured with

after 24 h fluorometrically as described in Materials and Methods. B, the above
cultures were also subjected to polarographic analysis. C, OCI-AML3 cells
cultured alone or in the presence of MSC were FACS sorted based on CD90
expression and protein lysates were blotted with a cocktail of total OXPHOS
complexes.

suggesting that their mitochondria are already partially uncoupled.
To then determine the kinetics of mitochondrial uncoupling in
leukemia cocultures, the loss in DWM in OCI-AML3 cells was
evaluated 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after exposure to MSC feeder
layers. Our results show that DWM is decreased in a timedependent manner as early as 30 min after coculture (Fig. 4B).
Under the same experimental conditions, DWM in HL60 cells was
not decreased (data not shown). Interestingly, monitoring the use
of oxygen revealed that cocultures of OCI-AML3, but not HL60,
cells displayed a transient increased demand for oxygen 3 and
5 h after coculture that was no longer significant at 24 h (Fig. 4C).
Taken together, the above results suggest that OCI-AML3
mitochondria become rapidly uncoupled after exposure to MSC
feeder layers, and this results in loss of DWM with an
accompanying transient increase in oxygen consumption.
UCP2 contributes to mitochondrial uncoupling in leukemia
cells cocultured with MSC. To further understand the underlining
mechanism by which MSCs induce mitochondrial uncoupling in
leukemia cells, we investigated the expression of the energy

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

dissipating proteins UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, and UCP4, all of which
possess varying degrees of uncoupling function by short circuiting
the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient. The results in Fig. 4D
show that MSC feeder layers promoted the activation of UCP2
expression in OCI-AML3, but not of HL60, cells, and whereas
expression of UCP1, UCP3, or UCP4 was not detected in any cell
line investigated, TF1-RAS and TF1-SRC cells also increased the
expression of UCP2 (data not shown). Most notably, the expression
of UCP2 increased as early as 30 min after exposure of OCI-AML3
cells to MSC feeder layers (Fig. 5A), albeit maximal expression
levels did not occur until 120 min in coculture. To then determine
the contribution of UCP2 to the observed loss of DWM, we
decreased UCP2 expression by siRNA methodology. Albeit
leukemia cells are notoriously difficult to transfect, using
nucleofector technology, we achieved 33% decrease in the levels
of UCP2 in OCI-AML3 cells in coculture, and this reduction was
associated with a 22% protection from the loss of DWM observed
in coculture (Fig. 5B). Similarly, we observed that lactate
accumulation was diminished in OCI-AML3 cells treated with

The Warburg Effect in Leukemia-Stroma Cocultures

UCP2 siRNA, albeit our results failed to reach statistical
significance (Fig. 5C). Nonetheless, treatment with the protonophore CCCP (2 Amol/L) promoted the accumulation of lactate in
the culture medium of OCI-AML3 cells, suggesting that uncoupling
per se can indeed contribute to aerobic glycolysis (Fig. 5D).
Interestingly, inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide in
OCI-AML3 did not prevent the loss of DWM observed after a
120-min exposure to MSC feeder layers (Fig. 6A), and exposure of
OCI-AML3 cells to MSC feeder layers through a 0.4-Am filter also
resulted in significantly decreased DWM (Fig. 6B), albeit this
decrease was not as pronounced as the decrease seen in OCI-AML3
cells allowed to directly contact MSC feeder layers. Taken together,
the above results suggest that UCP2 expression partly contributes
to the observed loss of DWM, but that this contribution may occur
in the absence of de novo protein synthesis and may be initiated by
paracrine effectors.
Therapeutic relevance of mitochondrial uncoupling in
leukemia cells. Given the antiapoptotic and chemoprotective
role of UCP2 and the other UCP family members, we questioned
whether uncoupling per se could be chemoprotective. To test this
hypothesis, we exposed OCI-AML3 cells to the protonophore
uncoupler CCCP (1 and 2.5 Amol/L) followed by treatment with
mitoxantrone (120 nmol/L) for 24 h. As presented in Fig. 6C, CCCP
in a dose-dependent manner antagonized the proapoptotic effects
of mitoxantrone, significantly (P < 0.01) protecting OCI-AML3 cells
at 2.5 Amol/L. Similarly, exposure of OCI-AML3 cells to MSC feeder
layers protected OCI-AML3 cells against the proapoptotic effects
of mitoxantrone, cytosine arabinoside (AraC), and vincristine,

significantly increasing the EC50 for each drug (Fig. 6D ;
Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, HL60 cells grown on MSC
feeder layers were not protected against the cytotoxic effects of
mitoxantrone (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and similar observations
were made using AraC (data not shown). Interestingly, MSC feeder
layers did not prevent the decrease in the number of viable cells
induced by either mitoxantrone or AraC and only mildly
antagonized the growth-inhibitory effects of vincristine (Supplementary Fig. S1B), suggesting that MSC exposure does not
modulate the growth-inhibitory effects of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs but rather the apoptotic response to them. Taken
together, the above observations indicate that the antiapoptotic
effects of stromal cocultures may be partly mediated by
mitochondrial uncoupling, and support the notion that UCP2
may inhibit the activation of the mitochondrial permeability
transition, and therefore the release of proapoptotic factors, by
depolarizing the mitochondria leading to decrease uptake of
calcium and decrease ROS generation (9, 25).

Discussion
The precise mitochondrial events that contribute to the proglycolytic phenotype of cancer cells are not fully understood, but
Warburg hypothesized that a profound injury to respiration was the
underlying cause. Nonetheless, in a seminal article published in 1956,
Warburg briefly discussed the possibility, first suggested by Feodor
Lynen 14 years earlier, that in cancer cells the coupling of respiration to the synthesis of ATP could be broken (i.e., mitochondria in
cancer cells could be uncoupled). On one hand, this hypothesis

suggests that in the absence of permanent mitochondrial damage,
cancer cells may short circuit the electrochemical gradient leading
to intramitochondrial ATP hydrolysis and decreased flux of
pyruvate through the Krebs cycle, resulting in the eventual
accumulation of lactate. On the other hand, there is an accumulating
wealth of evidence that suggests that microenvironmental cues
(hypoxia, acidity, etc.) may promote the proglycolytic metabolism of
tumors. Could the leukemia microenvironment promote the
Warburg effect by activating mitochondrial uncoupling?
Our investigation suggests that the leukemia microenvironment,
modeled by a feeder layer of MSC, can indeed promote aerobic
glycolysis without a concomitant increase in glucose use; in contrast,
the consumption of glucose was enhanced in cocultures under
hypoxic conditions. In addition, it was observed that the accumulation of lactate was associated with a loss of DWM in leukemia cells,
suggesting that mitochondrial function was compromised. Although
we expected that the decreased DWM was the result of diminished
oxygen consumption, our results indicated instead that leukemia
cell mitochondria had become uncoupled, as evidenced by
decreased sensitivity to the DWM dissipating effects of oligomycin
and a transient increase in oxygen consumption. Most surprisingly,
uncoupling was mediated at least in part by the highly conserved
energy dissipating protein UCP2. Mechanistically, uncoupling
occurred rapidly after exposure to MSC feeder layers, was not
dependent on de novo protein synthesis, and did not necessitate cellto-cell contact, suggesting that paracrine effectors may activate
basal levels of UCP2 and/or additional DWM dissipating elements
that orchestrate the short circuiting of the electrochemical gradient.
Our observation that oxygen is still being reduced, although
pyruvate entry into the Krebs cycle is decreased, suggests that the

MSCs promote a metabolic shift to the oxidation of other carbon
sources. Recent evidence suggests that fatty acids can activate
mitochondrial uncoupling, and conversely, mitochondrial uncoupling can promote fatty acid oxidation (26–28). Moreover, a recent
report shows that UCP2 promotes fatty acid oxidation while limiting
the mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (29), and similarly, Harper and colleagues (30) suggested
a link between increased fatty acid metabolism and reduced DWM,
suggesting that a decrease in the electrochemical gradient of the
mitochondria may represent a metabolic shift to higher yield
bioenergetic substrates. A similar metabolic shift to the use of fatty
acids is promoted by leptin (31), a major cytokine regulator of UCP2
activity (32, 33). We have shown that leptin plays a role in stromamediated chemoprotection (34–36) and that the leptin receptor is
expressed in primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts and primary
acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (34–36). It is thus intriguing to
propose that leptin may be one of the paracrine effectors that
orchestrate mitochondrial uncoupling in a physiologic context.
Our data suggest that uncoupling per se can be chemoprotective,
presumably by increasing the threshold to mitochondrial permeability transition and apoptosis, as has been reported for UCP2 (9),
and agree with an earlier study that suggested an association of
UCP2 and decreased DWM with resistance to radiation-induced
cytotoxicity of mouse lymphoblastoid cells (30). This antiapoptotic
effect could be mediated by several factors, such as decreased
mitochondrial calcium uptake (37), decreased generation of ROS
(38), and potentially decreased accumulation of positively charged
toxic lipophilic species in the more cationic environment of the
depolarized mitochondria (39). More importantly, however, our
observations suggest that targeting fatty acid metabolism and/or

The Warburg Effect in Leukemia-Stroma Cocultures

UCPs may offer clinical benefit in the therapeutic treatment of
leukemias.
In conclusion, although the microenvironment has been shown
to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of leukemia in terms of
chemoprotection and maintenance of malignant cells (15, 40), our
report is the first to show that it also plays a role in the promotion
and/or maintenance of the Warburg effect in leukemias. Most
importantly, these observations uncover an intriguing pathway
activated by MSC that regulates the electrochemical gradient in
leukemic mitochondria. This pathway may constitute a novel target
for therapeutic intervention in hematologic malignancies.
