BACKGROUND: The increasing costs associated with large-scale adjuvant trials mean that the prognostic value of biologic markers is
increasingly important. The expression of nuclear antigen Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation, has been correlated with treatment efficacy and is being investigated for its value as a predictive marker of therapeutic response. In the current study, the authors explored
correlations between Ki-67 expression and tumor response, estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PgR) status, and
histopathologic response from the STAGE study (S

24 weeks before surgery. The Ki-67 index, hormone receptor (ER and PgR) status, and histopathologic responses were determined
from histopathologic samples that were obtained from core-needle biopsies at baseline and at surgery. Tumor response was determined by using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. RESULTS: In total, 197 patients were randomized to receive
either anastrozole plus goserelin (n ¼ 98) or tamoxifen plus goserelin (n ¼ 99). The best overall tumor response was better for the
anastrozole group compared with the tamoxifen group both among patients who had a baseline Ki-67 index 20% and among those
who had a baseline Ki-67 index <20%. There was no apparent correlation between baseline ER status and the Ki-67 index in either
group. Positive PgR status was reduced from baseline to week 24 in the anastrozole group. CONCLUSIONS: In premenopausal

INTRODUCTION
In addition to ablative surgery, radiotherapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy, an additional standard treatment option for
premenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer is the ER antagonist tamoxifen, either alone or
in combination with ovarian function suppression.1 Temporary and potentially reversible ovarian suppression can be
achieved by treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog, such as goserelin. Goserelin in combination
with tamoxifen has demonstrated improved progression-free survival and disease-free survival compared with goserelin
alone in premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (ER-positive and/or progesterone receptor [PgR]-positive) breast cancer in the advanced2 and adjuvant3 settings.
Nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs), including anastrozole and letrozole, and the irreversible steroidal aromatase
inactivator exemestane have demonstrated improved efficacy compared with tamoxifen in the advanced4-7 and adjuvant8-

treatment settings. Therefore, AIs in combination with
ovarian suppression have been evaluated for the treatment
of premenopausal women with ER-positive breast
cancer.13,14
Neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer provides an
opportunity for downstaging of large tumors to allow
patients to undergo breast-conserving surgery rather than
mastectomy. Chemotherapy can offer an effective neoadjuvant treatment; however, increasing evidence suggests
that ER-positive tumors are less sensitive to chemotherapy.15 It has been demonstrated that neoadjuvant endocrine therapy has efficacy in the treatment of ER-positive
disease among postmenopausal women, resulting in similar objective response rates and rates of breast-conserving
surgery for AIs compared with more cytotoxic chemotherapy.16 Therefore, the role of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal women is also of interest.
With the increasing costs associated with large-scale
adjuvant trials, both the prognostic value of biologic markers
and the long-term predictive value of short-term trials are
increasingly important. The expression of nuclear antigen
Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation, reportedly has been
correlated with treatment efficacy and is being investigated
for its value as a predictive marker of therapeutic response.17
In a cross-trial comparison, an increased reduction in Ki-67
expression after neoadjuvant treatment with anastrozole
compared with tamoxifen was observed consistently; and
increased progression-free survival has been reported for
anastrozole versus tamoxifen in the adjuvant Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial.8,18,19
The STAGE study (Study of Tamoxifen or Arimidex Combined With Goserelin Acetate to Compare Efficacy and Safety) was the first randomized trial to compare
anastrozole plus goserelin versus tamoxifen plus goserelin
in the neoadjuvant setting (24 weeks of therapy) in premenopausal women with ER-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, operable
breast cancer. The patients who received anastrozole plus
goserelin in that trial had a superior best overall tumor
response compared with the patients who received tamoxifen plus goserelin, as measured on magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) studies
(anastrozole plus goserelin, 64.3%; tamoxifen plus goserelin, 37.4%; estimated difference, 26.9%; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 13.5-40.4; P < .001). The treatment effect
was consistently in favor of anastrozole, regardless of the
measurement methods (caliper and ultrasound). The histopathologic response rate also was better in the anastrozole group (anastrozole plus goserelin, 41.8%; tamoxifen
plus goserelin, 27.3%; estimated difference, 14.6%; 95%

CI, 1.4-27.7; P ¼ .032). Both treatment regimens were
well tolerated, consistent with the known safety profiles of
anastrozole, tamoxifen, and goserelin.20 The geometric
mean Ki-67 index at baseline was 21.9% in the anastrozole group and 21.6% in the tamoxifen group. At week
24, the Ki-67 index was reduced in both treatment groups
(to 2.9% in the anastrozole group and to 8% in the tamoxifen group). The reduction from baseline to week 24 was significantly greater with anastrozole than with tamoxifen. The
estimated ratio of reduction between groups was 0.35 (95%
CI, 0.24-0.51; P < .001).20 Here, we report an exploratory
analysis of the STAGE study that investigated potential correlations between the Ki-67 index and the best overall tumor
response, ER status, PgR status, or histopathologic response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients

In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group,
multicenter trial, the participating patients were premenopausal women 20 years with ER-positive and HER2negative breast cancer who had operable and measurable
lesions (tumors measuring 2-5 cm, negative lymph node
status [N0], and no metastases [M0]). Inclusion and
exclusion criteria have been described previously.20
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral
anastrozole 1 mg daily with a tamoxifen placebo or oral tamoxifen 20 mg daily with an anastrozole placebo. Both
treatment groups received goserelin 3.6 mg as a subcutaneous injection every 28 days. Treatment continued for
24 weeks before surgery or until patients met any criterion
for discontinuation.
The primary study endpoint was the best overall tumor response during the 24-week neoadjuvant treatment period. Secondary endpoints included histopathologic
response, changes in estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) serum
and breast tumor tissue concentrations, changes in Ki-67
expression, and tolerability. For this exploratory analysis, we
assessed correlations between Ki-67 expression and tumor
response, ER status, PgR status, or histopathologic response.
The protocol was approved by an institutional
review board at all study sites, and all enrolled patients
provided written informed consent. The study (National
Clinical Trials identifier NCT00605267) was conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good
clinical practice, the applicable local regulatory requirements, and the AstraZeneca policy on Bioethics.
Assessments

Tumor measurements were performed using caliper measurements, ultrasound, or MRI or CT studies. The

primary analysis indicated that the best overall tumor
response for anastrozole versus tamoxifen was consistent,
regardless of the measurement method used.20 We present
tumor response data from the MRI or CT measurements
at day 0 and at 24 weeks. The objective tumor response
was assessed according to modified Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).21
The status of Ki-67, ER, and PgR was determined
using histopathologic core-needle biopsy specimens that
were collected at baseline and at surgery. Tissue sections
were fixed in formalin and stored at room temperature
before immunohistochemical staining. Ki-67 expression
was determined by staining sections with an anti-MIB-1
antibody at a central laboratory (SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan)
for assessment by a central review board. For all slides,
photomicrographs were taken from 3 to 5 hotspots at
20 magnification using light microscopy. Two pathologists independently assessed the photomicrographs, and
the Ki-67 index was calculated as the ratio of Ki-67-positive cancer cells from a total of 1000 cancer cells. ER-positive status and PgR-positive status at baseline were defined
as 10% staining of cancer cell nuclei determined by a pathologist at each individual study site (nuclei were assessed
using mouse monoclonal antibody clones 6F11 and 16,
respectively). Staining for ER and PgR also was assessed in
parallel using Allred scores by the Central Pathologist
Review Committee.22 An Allred score (the proportion
score plus the intensity score) of 3 defined ER or PgR
positivity, a score from 3 to <7 indicated medium
expression, and a score of 7 indicated rich expression.
Histopathologic effects were assessed by comparing
histopathologic samples that were obtained at baseline
and at surgery. For the assessment of histopathologic
706

response, the following categories were used: grade 0 indicated no response; grade 1a, marked change in <1 of 3
cancer cells; grade 1b, marked changes in 1 of 3 but <2
of 3 cancer cells; grade 2, marked changes in 2 of 3 cancer cells; and grade 3, necrosis or disappearance of all cancer cells and replacement of all cancer cells by granulomalike and/or fibrous tissue. The histopathologic response
was defined as the proportion of patients whose tumors
were classified as grade 1b, 2, or 3.23,24
Post hoc subset analyses were used to determine correlations between the baseline Ki-67 index (20% vs <20%)
and the best overall tumor response. The percentage change
in the Ki-67 index for responders (patients whose best overall tumor response was a complete or partial response) versus
nonresponders (patients whose best overall tumor response
was stable or progressive disease) also was compared. Correlations between the baseline Ki-67 index and the histopathologic response at week 24 also were evaluated, and we
used post hoc analyses to investigate correlations between
changes in the Ki-67 index from baseline to week 24 and
ER or PgR status at baseline. Positive ER and PgR status
(Allred score 3) also was assessed at baseline and at week
24. Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) scores,
which were calculated post hoc as the sum of risk points
weighted by the size of the hazard ratio for tumor size, pathologic lymph node status, ER status, and Ki-67 expression
for both recurrence-free and breast cancer-specific survival,
were determined for each patient at surgery according to the
methods described by Ellis and colleagues.25
Statistical Analysis

The sample size calculation and the main statistical analyses have been described previously.20 All randomized
patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis set.
In a post hoc exploratory analysis, chi-square tests
were performed to compare the best overall tumor
response at week 24 between baseline Ki-67 index categories (20% vs <20%) within each treatment group and
between treatment groups within each baseline Ki-67
index category. A chi-square test also was used to compare
the histopathologic response at 24 weeks between the
baseline Ki-67 index categories within each treatment
group. All tests were made at the nominal 2-sided significance level of .05.

baseline characteristics generally were well balanced
between the treatment groups (Table 1). Paired samples
for calculating changes in the Ki-67 index from baseline
to week 24 were available for 89 patients in the anastrozole plus goserelin group and for 86 patients in the tamoxifen plus goserelin group.
Correlation of the Baseline Ki-67 Index and Best
Overall Tumor Response

With a mean baseline Ki-67 index of 21.9% and 21.6%
in the anastrozole and tamoxifen treatment groups,
respectively, we used post hoc subset analyses to compare
patients according to their baseline Ki-67 index (20 vs
<20%). For anastrozole versus tamoxifen, best overall tumor response from baseline to week 24 was better with
anastrozole plus goserelin versus tamoxifen plus goserelin
both in patients who had a baseline Ki-67 index 20%
(73.2% vs 44.8%; P ¼ .002) and in patients who had a
baseline Ki-67 index <20% (52.5% vs 29%; P ¼ .035)
(Fig. 2A).
Within the treatment groups, the best overall tumor
response from baseline to 24 weeks, as measured by MRI
or CT, was significantly better with anastrozole plus
goserelin for patients who had a baseline Ki-67 index
20% than for those who had a baseline Ki-67 index
<20% (73.2% vs 52.5%; P ¼ .036). Among patients in
the tamoxifen plus goserelin group, the best overall tumor
response was 44.8% for patients who had a baseline Ki-67

index <20% (P ¼ .118) (Fig. 2A).
Correlation of the Baseline Ki-67 Index and
Histopathologic Response

There was no significant difference in the histopathologic
response between patients who had a baseline Ki-67 index
20% versus patients who had a baseline Ki-67 index
<20% in either treatment group (Fig. 2B).
Correlation of Change in the Ki-67 Index and
Responders/Nonresponders

A waterfall plot of changes in the Ki-67 index for individual patients, illustrated according to responders or nonresponders, is provided in Figure 3. There was no apparent
relation between a change in Ki-67 expression from baseline to week 24 for responders and nonresponders in
either treatment group.
Correlation of the Baseline Ki-67 Index and
Estrogen Receptor or Progesterone Receptor
Status

In both treatment groups, positive ER status, as determined by the Allred score, was observed in 100% of
patients at baseline and at week 24, and >90% of patients
in both treatment groups were ER rich (baseline Allred
score, 7). Therefore, it was not possible to determine
any potential relation between the baseline ER Allred
score and the percentage change in Ki-67 expression from
baseline to week 24 in either treatment group.
In the anastrozole plus goserelin group, 98.9% of
patients were positive for PgR expression at baseline, and
34.4% were positive for PgR expression at week 24. The
percentage of patients with positive PgR status was not
altered from baseline (91.9%) to week 24 (89.5%) in the
tamoxifen plus goserelin group (Fig. 4A). In both treatment groups, the mean decrease in the Ki-67 index was
greater in patients who had a baseline PgR Allred score
7 (anastrozole group, 88.8%; tamoxifen group,
67.6%), compared with patients who had a baseline
PgR Allred score <7 (anastrozole group, 74.1%; tamoxifen group, 32.8%) (Fig. 4B).
Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index Score

In the anastrozole treatment group, 33.3% of patients had
a PEPI score of 0 compared with 11.4% in the tamoxifen
group. Fewer patients (21.4%) had a PEPI score 4 in
the anastrozole group compared with patients in the
tamoxifen group (36.7%; P ¼ .002) (Table 2).

phase 3 randomized trial that compared tumor response
for anastrozole plus goserelin versus response tamoxifen
plus goserelin during 24 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment
in premenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer.
The primary analysis indicated that the reduction in the
Ki-67 index for patients who received goserelin was
greater with anastrozole coadministration compared with
tamoxifen, suggesting a greater inhibitory effect on tumor

cell proliferation with this treatment combination.20
Given the reported clinical prognostic value of Ki-67
expression after short-term neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer,19 this is in concordance with our
finding that anastrozole combined with goserelin demonstrates a superior best overall tumor response compared
with tamoxifen plus goserelin. Although Ki-67 is perceived as a reliable predictive endpoint, the outcomes of

this difference is not clear, although there were differences
in the baseline characteristics of patients in each study: the

STAGE study vs ER-positive/HER2-negative and ERpositive/HER2-positive in the ABCSG-12 trial), and the
proportion of women with a body mass index >25 kg/m2
was lower in the STAGE study (17% vs 33%). The
ABCSG-12 group did not assess Ki-67 levels. It is also
interesting to note that, as recently pointed out by Goncalves et al,27 in our study, serum estradiol suppression

appeared to decrease at week 24 compared with week 4,
although the suppression was not statistically significant.
This suggests the possibility of a gradual tachyphylaxis of
the estrogen-suppressing effects of combined goserelin
710

and anastrozole treatment, which potentially may explain
the difference in outcomes between the ABCSG-12 and
STAGE studies. However, further investigations would
be required to confirm this.

P values were determined using the chi-square test.

In the current study, the best overall tumor response
was superior with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen,
irrespective of the baseline Ki-67 index. Within the anastrozole treatment group, we observed that the best overall
tumor response was significantly better in patients who
had a baseline Ki-67 index 20% versus patients who had
a baseline Ki-67 index <20%. However, in the anastrozole group, we observed a numerically lower histopathologic response in patients who had a baseline Ki-67 index
20% compared with those who had a baseline Ki-67
index <20%. It was reported previously that baseline Ki67 expression was not associated with outcome after neoadjuvant endocrine treatment (including anastrozole,
letrozole, and tamoxifen) in ER-positive, postmenopausal
women who had breast cancer.19,25
There was no apparent relation between a reduction
in the Ki-67 index for responders and nonresponders in
either treatment group. Although there tended to be more
nonresponders among patients in the tamoxifen group
who had less of a reduction in the Ki-67 index, the Spearman rank-correlation between the percentage change in
the Ki-67 index and the best percentage change in greatest
tumor dimension for the tamoxifen group was a modest
0.314. This observation is essentially consistent with what
was reported previously by Dowsett et al, who conducted
a similar analysis of postmenopausal patients who received
neoadjuvant tamoxifen, anastrozole, and the tamoxifen/
anastrozole combination.28 This variation in the Ki-67
index change between responders and nonresponders
indicates that the mechanism of estrogen-dependent
growth is heterogeneous among breast tumors. Tumor
growth is determined by a balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis. Stimulation of cell proliferation by
estrogen may be dominantly implicated in tumor growth
in some tumors, whereas inhibition of apoptosis by estrogen may be dominantly implicated in other tumors.
Thus, a responder does not necessarily have a greater
reduction in the Ki-67 index compared with a nonresponder if apoptosis is induced more strongly in the former
than the latter after treatment.

In the neoadjuvant setting, endocrine therapy has
demonstrated greater (or equivalent) efficacy in postmenopausal women with a lower Ki-67 index.29,30 In
contrast, in our study, both anastrozole and tamoxifen
produced greater response rates in premenopausal women
with a higher Ki-67 index. It is therefore possible that the
main pathways of proliferative stimulation (and the effectiveness of endocrine treatments) may differ between premenopausal and postmenopausal women with ERpositive breast cancer, according to their level of Ki-67
expression. In general, high Ki-67 expression is traditionally is believed to offer a poor prognosis and is predictive
of response to chemotherapy regimens.31 However, our
results suggest that endocrine therapy has at least comparable effectiveness for premenopausal patients with ERpositive breast cancer who have a high Ki-67 index.
No correlation could be determined between a
change in the Ki-67 index and baseline ER status in either
treatment group. However, the number of patients who
were identified as PgR-positive decreased at week 24 in
the anastrozole treatment group, an effect that was not
observed in the patients who received tamoxifen plus
goserelin. PgR expression also was reduced under neoadjuvant AI treatment for breast cancer in the ABCSG 17
study, although it remains to be determined whether the
down-regulation of PgR may be used as a marker of clinical efficacy.32 In our study, the reason why the positive
rate of PgR was reduced in the anastrozole plus goserelin
arm compared with the tamoxifen plus goserelin arm is
most likely because of the estrogenic action of tamoxifen,
which would induce PgR expression.
Although there may be a potential correlation
between a reduction in Ki-67 and the baseline PgR Allred
score in patients who receive anastrozole plus goserelin
versus tamoxifen plus goserelin, further analyses will be
required to determine whether a Ki-67 reduction in
patients with high baseline PgR expression translates into
a clinical benefit.
After treatment with anastrozole, a lower proportion
of patients had a PEPI score 4 (indicating a high risk of
711

Original Article

recurrence) compared with the tamoxifen treatment
group. The PEPI model has been validated previously and
has indicated significant differences in recurrence-free survival in the adjuvant setting between 3 PEPI risk groups
(PEPI risk scores of 0, 1-3, and 4), with a PEPI score of
0 indicating a very low risk of relapse.25 Data from the adjuvant treatment setting will provide added knowledge for
the individualization of future adjuvant treatments after
neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer.
Currently, very little is known about the prognostic
effect of Ki-67 in premenopausal women. However, in 1
recent study, the prognostic significance of Ki-67 was
investigated in women with ER-positive breast cancer
who had received short-term presurgical tamoxifen, and
Decensi and colleagues reported that the Ki-67 response
was a good predictor of recurrence-free survival and overall survival.33
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized study
to investigate the potential of Ki-67 as a clinical biomarker
for AI efficacy in premenopausal women with ER-positive
breast cancer. It has been demonstrated that a reduction in
Ki-67 expression as a result of neoadjuvant AI treatment can
be a potentially useful marker of improved surgical outcomes in postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast
cancer, and such a reduction has been identified as predictive of favorable outcomes in the adjuvant treatment period.34 A reduction in Ki-67 expression during neoadjuvant
treatment reportedly was greater with anastrozole versus tamoxifen in postmenopausal women who had ER-positive
breast cancer,18 and a parallel result also was observed in the
corresponding adjuvant trial, in which recurrence-free survival also was greater for those who received anastrozole.8
Yet another similar result was observed for letrozole, in
which a greater Ki-67 reduction was observed compared
with tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant setting.35 Greater clinical
effectiveness also was observed for letrozole in the neoadjuvant setting, both in terms of the objective response rate and
the rate of breast-conserving surgery.36
In conclusion, tumor response was greater with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen, regardless of the baseline
Ki-67 index, in premenopausal women who received goserelin as neoadjuvant therapy for ER-positive, early stage
breast cancer. The current results indicate that endocrine
therapy may offer a more tolerable treatment option than
cytotoxic chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment for these
patients, and further studies of the anastrozole plus goserelin treatment combination in this setting are warranted.
