Abstract
Although radiation-induced bystander effects have been well
described over the past decade, the mechanisms of the
signaling processes involved in the bystander phenomenon
remain unclear. In the present study, using the Columbia
University charged particle microbeam, we found that
mitochondrial DNA–depleted human skin fibroblasts (Ro)
showed a higher bystander mutagenic response in confluent
monolayers when a fraction of the same population were
irradiated with lethal doses compared with their parental
mitochondrial–functional cells (R+). However, using mixed
cultures of Ro and R+ cells and targeting only one population of
cells with a lethal dose of A-particles, a decreased bystander
mutagenesis was uniformly found in nonirradiated bystander
cells of both cell types, indicating that signals from one cell
type can modulate expression of bystander response in
another cell type. In addition, we found that Bay 11-7082, a
pharmacologic inhibitor of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) activation, and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline1-oxyl-3-oxide, a scavenger of nitric oxide (NO), significantly
decreased the mutation frequency in both bystander Ro and R+
cells. Furthermore, we found that NF-KB activity and its
dependent proteins, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible
NO synthase (iNOS), were lower in bystander Ro cells when
compared with their R+ counterparts. Our results indicated
that mitochondria play an important role in the regulation of
radiation-induced bystander effects and that mitochondriadependent NF-KB/iNOS/NO and NF-KB/COX-2/prostaglandin
E2 signaling pathways are important to the process. [Cancer

Introduction
Radiation-induced bystander effect is defined as the induction of
biological effects in cells that are not directly traversed by a
charged particle but are receiving signals from the irradiated cells
that are in close proximity to them. Although the bystander effects
have been well described over the past decade (1–4), the precise
mechanisms of the process remain unclear. In subconfluent
cultures, there is evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS),
nitric oxide (NO), and cytokines, such as transforming growth
factor h, are involved in mediating the process (5–9). On the other
hand, gap junction–mediated cell-cell communications have been
shown to be critical for bystander effects in confluent cultures of
either human or rodent origins (10–13). It is likely that a

combination of pathways involving both primary and secondary
signaling processes is involved in producing a bystander effect.
Using primary human fibroblasts, we showed previously that the
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) signaling cascade, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, plays
an essential role in the bystander process (14). Because COX-2 is
often induced after treatment with growth factors and cytokines,
such as tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), we further showed that
treatment of bystander cells with anti-TNFa monoclonal antibody
(mAb) partially suppressed the nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) and
MAPK pathways. The observations that extracellularly applied
antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (15) and
catalase (16), can inhibit medium-mediated bystander response
suggest a role of reactive radical species in the bystander process.
Because mitochondria are the main source of energy production,
as well as generators of free radicals in cells, especially in
pathologic and stressful conditions, the present studies were
conducted to define the contribution of mitochondria to the
bystander response using mutagenesis as an end point. There is
recent evidence that point mutations in the mitochondrial genome
are induced among either directly irradiated cells with a 5-Gy dose
of g-rays or by exposure to bystander factor(s) obtained from such
cells (17). To better understand the role of mitochondria in the
radiation-induced bystander effect, mitochondrial DNA–depleted
human skin fibroblasts (HSF; Uo) and their parental mitochondrial
functional cells (U+) were used in conjunction with the Columbia
University charged particle microbeam and track segment
irradiation system. Because TNFa and ROS may induce the
inhibitor NF-nB kinase (IKK)–NF-nB pathways, we further
examined the link between the NF-nB signaling pathway and the
bystander response. In the present study, we found that Uo cells
were more sensitive to a-particle induced bystander mutagenesis.
In addition, NF-nB activity and both NF-nB–dependent COX-2 and
inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression levels were lower in
bystander Uo cells compared with bystander U+ cells. Furthermore,
we found that Bay 11-7082, a pharmacologic inhibitor of NF-nB
activation, and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline1-oxyl-3-oxide (c-PTIO), a scavenger of NO, significantly decreased
the mutation frequency in both bystander Uo and U+ cells. Our
results indicated that mitochondria played an important role in
radiation-induced bystander effect, partially via mitochondriadependent regulation of iNOS and COX2 signaling pathways.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Uo cells were generated by treatment of parental (U+) HSFs
with 50 ng/mL ethidium bromide in growth medium supplemented with
50 Ag/mL uridine, as described before (18). The U+ cells were maintained in
a 4.5 g/L glucose DMEM with 4 mmol/L L-glutamine and 110 mg/L sodium
pyruvate supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/mL penicillin,
and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. The Uo cells were cultured using the same
medium plus 50 Ag/mL uridine (Sigma), which provides an alternative

source of energy through glycolysis to ensure optimal growth (19). Primary
normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) in frozen vials were purchased from
Cambrex/Lonza. The NHLF cells were thawed and maintained in a
fibroblast growth medium supplied by the manufacturer (14). Cultures
were maintained at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The medium
was changed every 3 d, and the cells were passaged at confluence.
Microbeam irradiation. Cell tracker orange (CTO, 1 Amol/L)–stained
cells were mixed with nonstained, either same or different type cells, in a 1:10
ratio. Approximately, 3,000 exponentially growing mixed cells in a 1.5-AL volume were inoculated into each of a series of microbeam dishes coated with
Cel-Tak (BD Biosciences) to enhance cell attachment as described (20, 21).
The next day after plating, f90% of the attached cells were in contact with
neighboring cells. The image analysis system then located the centroid of
each CTO-stained cells and irradiated all of them, one at a time, with an
exact number of a-particles (90 keV/Am 3He ions) accelerated with a 5-MV
Singletron accelerator at the Radiological Research Accelerator Facilities of
Columbia University. After irradiation, cells were maintained in the dishes
overnight before being removed by trypsinization and replated into culture
flasks for the mutant assay as described (20, 21). After previously described
protocol, all controls were similarly stained and sham-irradiated as well.
Track segment irradiation procedure. The newly designed strip mylar
dishes were used in the present studies as described (14, 22). Exponentially
growing Uo and U+ cells were plated in the concentric strip mylar dishes a
couple of days before irradiation to ensure a confluent state. A 50-cGy dose
of 4He ions (120 keV/Am) was delivered to the cells as described above.
After irradiation, at selected time points, the inner and outer mylar dishes
were separated, and the cells from each growth surface were trypsinized
and individually pooled for end point analysis.
Survival of irradiated and nonirradiated bystander cells. Nonirradiated bystander, irradiated, and control cells were collected after irradiation
at different time points. Cultures were trypsinized and counted with a
Coulter counter, and aliquots of the cells were replated into 100-mmdiameter dishes for colony formation. Representative aliquots of cells were
further incubated for mutagenesis and other testings. Cultures for clonogenic
survival assays were incubated for 12 d, at which time they were fixed
with formaldehyde and stained with Giemsa. The number of colonies was
counted to determine the surviving fraction as described (20, 21).

Cell proliferation. Aliquots of 1  105 Uo and U+ cells were plated in T25
flasks. On days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 after plating, two flasks of cells were
trypsinized and then counted with a Coulter counter. The average number
of cells was plotted as a cell growth curve, and the doubling time of cells
was calculated as described (23).
PCR analysis of mitochondrial DNA. Two different pairs of primers
were chosen for mitochondrial DNA detection [primer 1 (251 bp) 1685–1709
(sense), 1912–1936 (antisense); primer 2 (261 bp) 3304–3324 (sense), 3543–
3565 (antisense)]. PCR amplifications were performed for 30 cycles using a
DNA thermal cycle model 9700 (Perkin-Elmer) in 50-AL reaction mixtures
containing 0.5 Ag of the DNA sample. Each PCR cycle consisted of
denaturation at 95jC for 30 s, annealing at 55jC for 30 s, and extension at
72jC for 30 s. After the last cycle, samples were incubated at 72jC for an
additional 10 min, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, and stained with
ethidium bromide.
Oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption in intact cells was assayed,
as described previously (19). Briefly, 1  107 wild-type and Uo cells were
suspended in 1.5 mL DMEM lacking glucose, and oxygen concentration was
assayed over 3 min at 37jC in a Hansatech (MA) Clark’s oxygen electrode
unit.
Cellular staining with fluorescent probes and flow cytometry. Cells
were stained with fluorescent dyes diluted in DMEM. The following dye
combinations were added for 45 min at 37jC in the dark (a) 20 nmol/L
dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6 for assessment of mitochondrial
membrane potential, Dcm; Invitrogen), (b) 2 Amol/L hydroethidine (HE for
assessment of superoxide production; Invitrogen), and (c) 3.5 Amol/L
4-amino-5-methylamino-2OE,7OE-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM
for the detecting of NO; Invitrogen). Flow cytometry was performed using
a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) to analyze fluorescent signaling,
propidium iodide staining of DNA and cell cycle distribution. DiOC6 and
DAF-FM fluorescence were analyzed in the FL1 channel, whereas HE
fluorescence was analyzed using the FL3 channel. Forward and side scatter
data were used to gate out cellular fragments.
Quantification of mutations at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase locus. To determine the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT ) mutant fraction, after a 7-d expression period,
2  105 cells per dish were plated into 25 to 30 dishes (100 mm) in a total of

Chemical). The cultures were further incubated for 12 d, at which time, the
cells were fixed and stained, and the number of HPRT mutant colonies
scored. Meanwhile, aliquots of 250 cells were plated in dishes containing
growth medium without 6-thioguanine for determination of plating
efficiency. The mutant fraction was calculated as the number of surviving
colonies divided by the total number of cells plated after correction for
plating efficiency.
Micronuclei scoring. The cytokinesis block technique was used for the
micronuclei assay. Briefly, cultures were treated with 1 Ag/mL cytochalasin-B
for 32 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehide for 20 min. Air-dried cells
were covered/stained with DAPI mounting solution. Micronuclei were
scored in the binucleated cells and classified according to standard criteria
(24). The micronuclei yield was calculated as the ratio of number of
micronuclei to the scored number of binucleated cells.
Western blotting. Protein was extracted from either the control or
bystander cells by lysis in extracting buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8).
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche)]. The concentration
of the protein was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad).
Equivalent amounts of protein (50–100 Ag) were fractionated on a 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel for 3 h, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes under semidry conditions. Mouse monoclonal anti-human
COX-2 (Cayman), mouse polyclonal antibody against iNOS (Cell Signaling),
and mAb against h-actin (Sigma) were used. The secondary antibodies were
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antimouse or antirabbit IgG diluted
1:5,000 to 1:10,000. After electrochemiluminescence, the band intensities
were evaluated by phosphorimaging and normalized to h-actin protein
level.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) was performed for the detection of NF-nB DNA-binding
activity, as previously described using the labeled double-strand oligonucleotide AGCTTGGGGACTTTCCAGGCG (binding site is italicized). Ubiquitous NF-Y DNA-binding activity was used as an internal control (25).
Statistical analysis. Data were calculated as means and SDs. Comparisons of surviving fractions and induced mutant fractions between treated
and control groups were made by the Students’ t tests. A P value of 0.05
or less between groups was considered significant.

Results
Characterization of mitochondrial DNA–depleted (Ro) cells
and their parental (R+) cells. A series of experiments were
conducted to characterize the differences between Uo cells and
their parental U+ cells. In the presence of uridine, Uo cells grew very
well in culture. Addition of uridine to culture medium did not
affect the radiosensitivity of HSF and the dose-response survival
curves of Uo and U+ HSF culture were similar (data not shown).
Compared with U+ cells, Uo cells showed only a slight decrease in
saturation density as the culture approached confluency (data not
shown). Using two different primer sets that corresponded to
different segments of the mitochondrial DNA, we detected no
mitochondrial DNA band in Uo cells; in contrast, a clear band was
detected in U+ cells with either of the primer pairs (Fig. 1A). When
the cells were stained with the mitochondrial membrane potential
probe DiOC6, Uo cells showed a decrease in fluorescence intensity
(mean intensity, 95.1 arbitrary units, A.U.) relative to control U+
cells (mean intensity, 226 A.U.; Fig. 1B). Likewise, mitochondrial
DNA–depleted cells showed a decrease in intracellular superoxide
content (mean intensity, 8.2 A.U.) when compared with wild-type
cells (mean intensity, 30.0 A.U.; Fig. 1C). To further confirm that Uo
cells had compromised mitochondrial function, we showed that
these cells had an oxygen consumption level that was 20 times less
than wild-type cells (Fig. 1D). These data clearly indicate that Uo
cells have dysfunctional mitochondria and that this cell line is a
good model to investigate the role of mitochondria in radiationinduced bystander responses.
A-Irradiation induces a higher bystander mutagenic rate in
Ro cells than in R+ cells. To explore the role of mitochondria in the
radiation-induced bystander effect, a microbeam was used to
lethally irradiate either Uo or U+ cells with 20 a-particles, each in a
mixed confluent culture, and the bystander response was
determined in the nonirradiated fraction. We found that Uo cells,
when compared with U+ cells, showed a higher bystander HPRT

mutagenic response (15.2 versus 5.4 per 106 survivors, P < 0.05) in
confluent monolayer when 10% of the same population were
lethally irradiated (Fig. 2A and B). It should be noted that the
background mutant fraction of Uo and U+ cells was similar being
f1.0 per 106 survivors. However, using mixed cultures of Uo and U+
cells and targeting only one population of cells with a lethal dose of
a-particles, a decreased bystander mutagenesis was uniformly
found with both cell types. For example, when 10% of the
CTO-stained Uo cells (in culture with 90% of nonstained Uo cells)
were irradiated with 20 a-particles, the mutant fraction among the
nonhit bystander Uo cells was f15.2 per 106 survivors. However,
when a similar number of Uo cells were irradiated among 90% of
wild-type cells, the resultant bystander mutant fraction was only
3.1 per 106 surviving U+ cells (P < 0.05). Similarly, when 10%
CTO-stained U+ cells were lethally irradiated with a-particles, the
mutant yield was f5.4 in 106 surviving bystander U+ cells, but only
1.8 per 106 surviving bystander Uo cells (P < 0.05). These results
indicate that mitochondria-deficient cells cannot effectively
communicate the bystander signals with wild-type cells; or
alternatively, signals from one cell type can modulate expression
of bystander response in another cell type.
Track segment irradiation confirms bystander mutagenesis
in Ro and R+ cells. Because the microbeam can only irradiate a
limited number of cells, to generate sufficient bystander cells for
mechanistic studies, we used the specially designed strip mylar

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

dishes and track segment irradiation as described (14, 21). Because
cells that were seeded on the thicker mylar (38 Am) would not be
traversed by a-particles but would be in the vicinity of those seeded
on thinner mylar (6 Am) that would, we had, effectively, a pure
population of bystander cells. Exposure of U+ cells to a dose of
0.5 Gy a-particles increased the bystander HPRT mutant yield to a
level 2.6 times higher than the background incidence. However,
under similar irradiation conditions, Uo cells had a bystander
mutant fraction that was 7.1-fold higher than nonirradiated Uo cells
(Fig. 2C and D). These results are consistent with the data generated from microbeam irradiation, showing that mitochondriadeficient cells have a higher mutation frequency in both directly
irradiated and bystander cells. Comparing with the data generated
using the microbeam, the bystander mutagenesis obtained using
the broad, track segment beam for both the U+ and Uo HSFs was
significantly reduced (P < 0.05).
Effect of c-PTIO on bystander mutagenesis. To determine if
NO is linked to mitochondrial function in mediating the bystander
response, we treated cells with 20 Amol/L c-PTIO, a NO scavenger,
2 hours before and maintained overnight after irradiation. As
shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with c-PTIO significantly reduced the
bystander mutagenesis in both Uo and U+ cell lines (P < 0.05).
However, the effect of c-PTIO on the bystander response in U+ cells
was more pronounced than in Uo cells. The induced mutation
frequency was reduced from 1.90 to 0.37 per 106 survivors (5.1-fold)

in wild-type cells compared with a reduction from 4.19 to 2.05 per
106 survivors (2.0-fold) in Uo cells. These results indicated that, in
addition to NO, other signaling molecules might play a role in
modulating the bystander effects in mitochondria-deficient cells.
Role of NF-KB in the bystander response. Expression of the
iNOS gene is controlled by the transcription factor NF-nB. To
define the function of NF-nB in radiation-induced bystander
effects, cells were treated with 1 Amol/L Bay 11-7082, a
pharmacologic inhibitor of IKK–NF-nB activation, 2 hours before
irradiation, and maintained overnight after irradiation. The dose of
Bay 11-7082 used was nontoxic, nonmutagenic in both Uo and U+
cell lines. Treatment of both cell types with Bay 11-7082 resulted in
a significant reduction of the bystander mutagenesis (P < 0.05;
Fig. 3B). The inhibition by Bay 11-7082 on radiation-induced
bystander effects was similar to that of c-PTIO: being more
effective in U+ (3.0-fold, P < 0.01) than in Uo cells (1.5-fold, P < 0.05).
Consistent with these observations, we found that the basal and
inducible (both directly irradiated and bystander) levels of
nuclear NF-nB DNA-binding activity were notably higher in U+
compared with Uo cells (Fig. 3C). Consequently, expression levels of

NF-nB–dependent proteins, such as iNOS and COX-2, were notably
lower in Uo cells (Fig. 3D).
We previously reported that the COX-2/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
signaling pathway, which is a hallmark of inflammation and ROS
production, was critically linked to radiation bystander phenomenon in normal human fibroblasts (14). In the present study, 3-fold
and 6-fold increases in COX-2 expression level were found in
directly irradiated and bystander U+ cells, respectively (Fig. 3D).
However, COX-2 expression increased only slightly in directly
irradiated and bystander Uo cells (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these
results indicated that inducible (but not basal) expression of
COX-2, which was substantially lower in mitochondria-deficient
cells, plays a critical role in regulating mechanisms of bystander
effects, which is consistent with our previous findings (14).
However, these results also pointed out that other mechanisms of
radiation-induced bystander effect might be different in mitochondria-deficient cells. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that
signaling pathways, other than the COX-2/PGE2 and iNOS/NO
pathways, might be activated by NF-nB and can induce bystander
mutagenesis.

Role of NF-KB in A-particle–induced bystander effects in
NHLF. Because NF-nB is an important transcription factor for
many signaling genes, including COX-2, we used NHLF cultures,
which were used previously to document COX-2 activities
in bystander signaling (14), to examine the role of NF-nB in
the bystander response. a-Particle irradiation up-regulated
NF-nB–binding activity in both directly irradiated and bystander
cells, whereas Bay 11-7082, a pharmacologic inhibitor of the
IKK/NF-nB, efficiently suppressed this up-regulation and also
reduced levels below basal amount (Fig. 4A). This inhibitor of
NF-nB activity also efficiently down-regulated COX-2 and iNOS
expression levels in both directly irradiated and bystander
fibroblasts (Fig. 4B). Micronuclei formation was readily detected
in directly irradiated and bystander cells, whereas both Bay
11-7082 (Fig. 4C) and c-PTIO (Fig. 4D) effectively decreased this
level in bystander cells (P < 0.05).
Effects of cytokines on the bystander effects. TNFa might be
an excellent candidate in mediating bystander effects in NHLF.
Exogenous TNFa in concert with IL1h directly controls COX-2
expression in NHLF (Fig. 5A). Both TNFa and IL1h could be
induced after a-irradiation of NHLF. The inhibitory mAb against
TNFa, which was introduced into the cell media, substantially
decreased levels of NF-nB (Fig. 5B) and c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK;
data not shown) that was accompanied by a well-pronounced
decrease in the COX-2 expression level in both irradiated and,
especially, in bystander NHLF (Fig. 5C). Simultaneously, the
negative effect of anti-TNF mAb on extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) activity (phosphorylated ERK protein level) was
relatively modest (data not shown). As an additional physiologic

test, we determined clonogenic survival of NHLF during a partial
suppression of TNF levels by the inhibitory effect of anti-TNF mAb.
We found a significant increase in cell survival of bystander cells
treated with anti-TNF mAb (P < 0.05; Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Although radiation-induced bystander effects have attracted
much attention in the past decade, the mechanisms of the process
remain unclear. It is likely that cellular signaling pathways, for
example, membrane ligands and the downstream MAPK cascade,
provide a common link between medium-mediated and
gap-junction–dependent bystander phenomena. Previous studies
by Mitchell et al. have shown that when 10% of cells are exposed to
a-particles, a significantly greater number of cells are inactivated
when irradiated at high density (>90% in contact with neighbors)
than at low density (<10% in contact). In addition, the bystander
oncogenic transformation frequency is significantly higher in highdensity cultures (26). These results suggest that when cells are
traversed by a-particles, the transmission of a bystander signal
through cell-to-cell contact results in a higher response compared
with those mediated by soluble factors. In the present study, we
observed a similar density-dependent bystander response. In
microbeam irradiation, a higher bystander mutagenesis was found
because cells had more cell-cell contact compared with cells plated
in specially designed strip dishes.
Nitric oxide has been postulated to be a potential signaling
molecule in radiation-induced bystander effects (27–29). Shao et al.
reported that when only 1% of cell nuclei were individually targeted

Mitochondrial Functions and Bystander Response

Figure 6. A unifying model of the signaling
pathways involved in radiation-induced
bystander effects. Secreted or membrane
forms of cytokines, such as TNFa, activate
IKK-mediated phosphorylation of InB, which
releases NF-nB, that enters the nucleus
and acts as a transcription factor for COX-2
and iNOS . TNFa also activates MAPK
pathways (ERK, JNK, and p38) that via
activator protein 1 transcription factor
additionally up-regulate expression of
COX-2 (14) and iNOS, which stimulate the
production of NO. Mitochondrial damage
facilitates the production of hydrogen
peroxide that migrates freely across plasma
membrane and is subjected to antioxidant
removal. Activation of COX-2 provides a
continuous supply of reactive radicals
and cytokines for the propagation of the
bystander signals either through gap
junction or medium.

with a single helium ion, f40% of the cells showed an increase in
fluorescence intensity of the NO-sensitive dye, DAF-FM. Moreover,
it was found that when only one cell in a population of f1,200
cells was targeted with one or five ions, the incidence of
micronuclei increased by 20% and concurrent treatment with
c-PTIO significantly reduced the bystander effect (30). In the
present study, we found that the NO scavenger had a similar
suppressive effect on bystander mutagenesis of both U+ and Uo
cells, although the effects were more pronounced in the former.
Because mitochondria are the main source of reactive radical
species in cells, the basal level of free radicals in Uo cells is lower
than in mitochondrial functional cells (Fig. 1B–D). There is
evidence that, in Uo cells with a complete shutdown of the
electron transport chain, the decreased level of reactive oxygen
species resulted in a down-regulation of the manganese superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase, an
important intracellular antioxidant pool (31). As such, compared
with wild-type cells, Uo cells are more susceptible to oxidative
stress and expressed in a higher bystander mutagenesis as shown
in the present studies. It is likely that one or more other signaling
molecules, in addition to NO, are involved in radiation induced
bystander effects in mitochondria-deficient cells. This could
explain the difference in bystander signaling response in mixed
cultures of U+ and Uo cells. Alternatively, Uo cells, by virtue of their
reduced apoptotic response,4 may accumulate a higher mutant
fraction. This will be consistent with the higher bystander
response seen in these cells. It is also possible that signal from
one cell line can modulate expression of bystander response in

another cell type (32) and is consistent with the findings with the
mixed cell population (Fig. 2A and B).
Elevated levels of NO have been detected in a variety of
pathophysiologic processes, including inflammation and carcinogenesis (33, 34). In our previous study, we found that COX-2 is
critically linked to the radiation-induced bystander effect in normal
human fibroblasts (14). There is evidence that NO can induce
expression of COX-2 in mouse skin and human cultured airway
epithelial cells and that the NF-nB pathway is involved in the
process (35, 36). Our findings that Bay 11-7082, a specific IKK/NF-nB
inhibitor, could eliminate bystander mutagenesis in both wild-type
and Uo cells highlight the important role of this transcription
factor in the bystander phenomenon (Fig. 3B). NF-nB directly
controls gene expression of COX-2 and iNOS. As proposed in our
working model, cytokines of the TNFa superfamily might be
excellent candidates in mediating bystander effects (Fig. 6).
Ionizing radiation is a strong inducer of the ATM-IKK-NF-nB
signaling pathway (37), which is further involved in the upregulation of TNFa gene expression (38). Secreted or membrane
forms of TNFa could induce bystander effects in nonirradiated
cells via activation of COX-2 gene expression, as we observed in the
present study. Inhibitory mAb against TNF partially suppressed
NF-nB activation and the subsequent COX-2 up-regulation in both
directly irradiated and bystander cells (Fig. 5). Taken together, our
data showed a connection between up-regulation of NF-nB
activation and mitochondrial function in mediating the bystander
phenomenon. Indeed, NF-nB–dependent functions are characteristic for both U+ and Uo cells, although in the last case, levels of
inducible NF-nB activity were substantially lower (Fig. 3C). As
expected, in cells with functional mitochondria, up-regulation of
COX-2 was detected in both directly irradiated and bystander cells
(Fig. 3D). This increase in COX-2 expression levels was almost

completely blocked in the presence of Bay 11-7082 (Fig. 4B).
It indicates that the NF-nB/COX-2/PGE2 and NF-nB/iNOS/NO
pathways are critical to the radiation induced bystander effect in
mitochondrial functional cells. However, in Uo cells, the contribution of COX-2 to the bystander process is less pronounced, whereas
NF-nB/iNOS/NO pathway actively operates, although at lower level
compared with normal cells.
