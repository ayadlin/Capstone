Therapeutic Targeting of BRCA1-Mutated Breast Cancers
with Agents That Activate DNA Repair
Elizabeth Alli1, David Solow-Cordero2, Stephanie C. Casey1, and James M. Ford1,3

Abstract
Cancers due to germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene tend to lack targets for approved chemoprevention
agents. This study aimed at a targeted chemoprevention strategy for BRCA1-associated malignancies. Mutant
BRCA1 limits the base-excision DNA repair activity that addresses oxidative DNA damage, the accumulation of
which heightens one's risk for cancer. Therefore, we conducted a high-throughput chemical screen to identify
drug candidates that could attenuate the inhibitory effects of mutant BRCA1 on this repair activity, thereby
describing a new class of DNA repair-activating chemopreventive agents. In the screen design, such drugs
functioned by enhancing base-excision DNA repair of oxidative DNA damage in the presence of mutant BRCA1,
with minimal cytotoxicity. We identiﬁed at least one new agent that decreased malignant properties associated
with tumorigenesis, including anchorage-independent growth and tumor progression. This work offers a
preclinical proof-of-concept for a wholly new approach to chemoprevention in carriers of BRCA1 mutations
as a strategy to reduce the prevalence of BRCA1-associated malignancy. Cancer Res; 74(21); 6205–15. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) encodes a
tumor suppressor that acts to maintain genetic stability.
Individuals who inherit a mutation in BRCA1 are predisposed
to developing breast, ovarian, and other cancers. In fact,
carriers of BRCA1 mutations have a 44% to 75% lifetime risk
for developing breast cancer (1, 2) and up to an approximate
45% risk for developing a second primary breast cancer (3–6).
Germline mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for approximately half of hereditary breast cancer cases (7). BRCA1mutated breast cancers are particularly aggressive and exhibit
poor outcomes compared with other subtypes of breast cancer.
They frequently contain mutations in TP53 and tend to be
"triple-negative" due to their lack of expression of estrogen
receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2/NEU oncogene,
thereby rendering them relatively resistant to existing anticancer strategies that rely on p53-dependent apoptosis or use
endocrine-based or HER2-directed therapy (2, 8–11). Notably,
the selective estrogen receptor modiﬁers (SERM) tamoxifen
and raloxifene are the only FDA-approved chemoprevention
agents for breast cancer. Tamoxifen has displayed mixed

results in studies that evaluated its preventive beneﬁt in
carriers of BRCA1 mutations (12–16); however, due to the lack
of expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in
BRCA1-mutated tumors, SERMs are thought to be relatively
ineffective in this setting. Furthermore, raloxifene is not currently FDA-approved for the chemoprevention of breast cancer
in premenopausal women, and carriers of BRCA1 mutations
tend to develop breast cancer before menopause (17, 18).
Therefore, BRCA1-associated malignancies are prevalent,
aggressive, and in need of an effective chemoprevention
strategy.
Cellular characteristics that contribute to tumorigenesis,
such as defects in the defense mechanisms against oxidative
DNA damage (ODD), are important for the discovery of cancer
prevention strategies. ODD is generated by reactive oxygen
species due to normal metabolism and other biologic processes. A single human cell experiences approximately 104 oxidative lesions per day (19), making ODD the most common form
of DNA damage. ODD is typically repaired by the base-excision
DNA repair (BER) pathway. When left unrepaired, ODD
leads to mutagenesis, genetic instability, and ultimately the
initiation and progression of breast and other cancers (20–22).
BRCA1 has been shown to play a role in BER of ODD (23, 24),
and BRCA1-mutated breast cancers displayed a compromised
ability for BER of ODD (23). Therefore, in pursuit of a targeted
chemoprevention strategy for BRCA1-associated malignancies, we sought to identify small molecules that enhanced the
repair of ODD in the presence of mutant BRCA1, which, in turn,
may prevent tumorigenesis.

Chemoprevention for BRCA1-Mutated Cancer

HCC1937), wild-type BRCA1 breast cancer (BT474, MCF7), and
the normal breast (MCF10A). SUM149 and SUM1315 were
purchased and characterized by Asterand plc using short
tandem repeat (STR) polymorphism analysis. All other cell
lines were purchased and characterized by ATCC using STR
DNA proﬁling. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma,
were passaged for fewer than 6 months after receipt or
resuscitation from frozen stocks created within 2 weeks of
purchase, and were then cultured as recommended by the
manufacturer. Human breast cancer cell lines isogenic for
BRCA1 included MCF7-shCTRL and MCF7-shBRCA1. Nontargeting control shRNA (50 -GGAGATCAGCCATTAATAT-30 ) and
BRCA1 shRNA (50 -TGCCAAAGTAGCTAATGTA-30 ) were
cloned into pSUPER.retro.puro (Oligoengine) according to the
manufacturer's instructions and then transduced into MCF7
cells. Stable selection was carried out with puromycin.
High-throughput chemical screen
The reagents, compound library, screening protocol, and
post-screen analysis as depicted in Fig. 1 are further described
in Supplementary Methods.
Drugs
Benserazide, acetohexamide, tamoxifen, and carbidopa
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and prepared as described
by the manufacturer. Treatment with drug occurred for 24
hours unless speciﬁed otherwise.
BER assay
Adenovirus coding GFP (ad-GFP, Clontech) was incubated
with methylene blue and exposed to visible light for 0
(undamaged control) or 2 minutes to induce ODD. Cells
were then infected with undamaged or damaged ad-GFP
and, after 24 hours, analyzed for GFP expression. Percentage
repair is the percentage of GFP expression (normalized to
cell number) from damaged virus relative to undamaged
virus.
DNA damage
Detection of 8oxoG was measured by ﬂow cytometry using
the OxyFLOW Kit (HemoGenix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of H2O2-induced ODD was
measured by the alkaline comet assay modiﬁed for detection
of oxidative damage. Cells were treated with 25 mmol/L H2O2
for 10 minutes at 4 C and then allowed to repair for 4 hours
under normal culture conditions. Cells were then subjected
to the alkaline comet assay using the CometAssay HT
Reagent Kit (Trevigen) as described by the manufacturer

with the following modiﬁcations. Before denaturation, DNA
was treated  FPG enzyme (NE Biolabs) at 37 C and 5% CO2
for 45 minutes to nick DNA at sites of ODD. Comet heads
indicate undamaged DNA and comet tails indicate DNA
damage; therefore, comets were analyzed for the "% DNA
in tail" using CometScore software (TriTek Corporation).
ODD was calculated by subtracting "% DNA in tail" in FPG
samples from "% DNA in tail" in FPGþ samples. Detection of
DNA strand breaks was also carried out by the alkaline
comet assay using the CometAssay HT Reagent Kit (Trevigen) as described above; however, DNA strand breaks were
calculated as the "%DNA in tail" in FPG samples. Detection
of serum levels of 8oxodG was carried out using the HT 8oxo-dG ELISA Kit (Trevigen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Anchorage-independent growth
Single-cell suspensions were cultured in soft agar supplemented with medium containing drug or vehicle control for up
to 14 days. Colonies were counted and expressed as a percentage of the control.
Trypan blue exclusion assay
Single-cell suspensions were cultured in regular growth
media with drug or vehicle control. After 2 days, cells were
washed and subjected to trypan blue dye. The number of blue/
nonviable and white/viable cells was then counted to calculate
the percentage of viable cells.
Tumor progression
Animal experiments were carried out in compliance with
AAALAC Accreditation guidelines and were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Stanford
University (Stanford, CA). NOD/SCID female mice, 4 to 6
weeks of age, were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and
were maintained under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions.
Mice were inoculated by subcutaneous injection with
3  106 HCC1937 human breast cancer cells conﬁrmed to
be pathogen-free in 100 mL of PBS and Matrigel (1:1).
Subcutaneous injection into the mammary fat pad occurred
under 0.5% to 3% isoﬂurane for animal comfort. One day
before tumor inoculation, mice were divided into three
groups for study: vehicle control (saline), 50 mg/kg benserazide, or 250 mg/kg benserazide. Mice were administered
treatment in 0.05 mL saline daily by intraperitoneal injection
until procedure endpoint (60 days). Palpable tumor burden
was determined weekly beginning at day 30. At the study
endpoint, blood was collected for analysis of ODD, tumor

Figure 1. A high-throughput chemical screen identiﬁed DNA repair–activating agents. A, the screening protocol consisted of four basic steps: (i) plating of BERdefective cells, (ii) addition of compounds/controls, (iii) the BER assay, and (iv) addition of Hoechst 33342 live cell dye (to allow for normalization to cell number)
before ﬂuorescent detection by image analysis and plate reading. B, post-screen analysis included normalization of GFP expression, calculation of the % BER
activity relative to the negative control for each method of detection, and identiﬁcation/prioritization of active compounds. Active compounds were deﬁned as
having produced a dose–response increase in GFP expression (EC50) or having increased GFP expression more than 10% over the negative control at
either of the two highest concentrations tested (Activity[High]). For each compound, up to four priority scores were assigned (to reﬂect the signiﬁcance of the
method of detection and calculation) and added to generate a summed priority score  10. C, each bar represents the number of active compounds assigned
to each priority score. D, hits were deﬁned as active compounds with a summed priority score > 1. The graph depicts the number of hits with and without
potential cytotoxicity for each summed priority score. Higher summed priority scores predict BER activity with greater signiﬁcance. E, the compound library
was sorted by functional class (as deﬁned by the manufacturer), and the percentage of hits within each class was calculated.

was excised and weighed, and anatomy was analyzed for
metastasis. To decipher between treatment-mediated effects
and the lack of tumor uptake, mice without a palpable tumor
were monitored for late tumor formation for 6 additional
weeks without treatment after the study endpoint. Late
tumor formation indicated that the lack of tumor at the
study endpoint was due to treatment-mediated effects rather than a lack of tumor uptake; tumor and metastasis data
collected at the study endpoint were then included in the
analyses. Conversely, the absence of late tumor formation
suggested the lack of tumor uptake, and data were thereby
excluded from the analysis.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using the Student t
test with the following exceptions. The relationship between
the average serum levels of 8oxodG and tumor weights was
determined using the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (r). P
values for in vivo data over time were relative to the vehicle
control and determined by ANOVA.

Results
High-throughput screening for small molecules that
activate BER
We ﬁrst established a high-throughput screening protocol to
identify small molecules that activate repair of ODD. Our
protocol consisted of screening a compound library using
a DNA repair assay that evaluated BER of ODD while maintaining an intact cellular environment (23). Brieﬂy, cells are
delivered an ODD-containing GFP reporter gene via adenoviral-mediated gene transfer, allowed sufﬁcient time to carry out
repair, and then analyzed for ﬂuorescence. In this system, ODD
interferes with the transcription and subsequent expression of
GFP. Therefore, cells with defective BER do not ﬂuoresce.
However, small molecules that facilitate repair of the ODDcontaining GFP reporter gene may enable the expression of
GFP in cells with defective BER and thereby produce a ﬂuorescent signal. We used the BRCA1-mutant SUM149 human
breast cancer cell line due to its susceptibility to adenoviral
infectivity (required for delivery of the ODD reporter gene) and
its inability to effectively repair ODD (required for detection of
compound-facilitated BER; Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 23). We
chose to screen the LOPAC1280 library (Sigma-Aldrich), which
consisted of 1,280 compounds with known pharmacologic
activity, in a quantitative high-throughput (qHT) format (25)
starting at a 20 mmol/L ﬁnal concentration of compound in
each well (0.2% DMSO) followed by up to 6 (2-fold) dilutions.
DMSO was the negative control and 18 mmol/L bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was the positive control. We identiﬁed
BrdUrd in a preliminary screen (Supplementary Fig. S2) due
to the lack of an existing but necessary small-molecule positive
control.

We next adapted and validated our protocol for highthroughput screening (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). The
protocol, as depicted in Fig. 1A, produced a Z0 -factor ¼ 0.6,
coefﬁcient of variance (CV) ¼ 7%, S/B ¼ 10, and no signiﬁcant
edge or drift effects (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Finally, we carried out the validated protocol in 384-well
qHT format. BRCA1-mutant SUM149PT cells were treated with
up to 7 doses of compound (or control), subjected to the DNA
repair assay, and assessed for GFP expression by 2 different
means (i.e., imaging and plate reading). Greater GFP expression indicated greater enhancement of repair.
We then developed a scoring system to identify and prioritize active compounds based on their ability to enhance BER
of ODD. The scoring system consisted of assigning "priority
scores" based on the level of signiﬁcance of each method of GFP
detection (imaging > plate reading) and deﬁnition of an active
compound (EC50 > Activity[High]) and then calculating a
"summed priority score" that ranged from 1 to 10 for each
molecule; higher scores indicated higher priority (Fig.
1B). Figure 1C and D depict the number of molecules for each
assigned "priority score" and "summed priority score," respectively. In general, the number of molecules increased as the
score decreased. The high prevalence and low priority of
molecules with a "summed priority score" of 1 resulted in their
elimination; remaining molecules were deﬁned as hits.
We identiﬁed 94 molecules that potentially enhanced BER of
ODD (hit rate ¼ 7.3%; Fig. 1D). Evaluation of the functional
classes of these compounds revealed the greatest percentage of
hits as having activity in DNA metabolism or DNA repair
(Fig. 1E). Given that cytotoxic compounds may be undesirable
for chemoprevention, we used our screening data acquired by
imaging to identify compounds that decreased the number of
Hoechst 33342–positive cells (i.e., living cells) by 20% compared with the negative control. Elimination of these potentially cytotoxic compounds resulted in a subset of 49 hits (hit
rate ¼ 3.8%; Fig. 1D). Detailed results for all 94 hits have been
provided in Supplementary Table S1, including the EC50 and%
BER activity at high concentrations (for each method of GFP
detection), the "summed priority score," percentage of
Hoechst-positive cells, and functional class. These molecules
have been classiﬁed as "DNA repair–activating agents."
Functional activity of DNA repair–activating agents
We further analyzed 2 hits, acetohexamide and benserazide
(Fig. 2), because they carried the highest summed priority score
with the least amount of cytotoxicity (based on screening data).
Both acetohexamide and benserazide carried summed priority
scores of 7 and resulted in 87.8% and 85.9% of cells staining
positive for Hoechst 33342 live cell dye, respectively. To validate activity, acetohexamide and benserazide were reordered
from the original vendor and analyzed for BER activity and
ODD levels. Acetohexamide produced a dose–response

increase in repair of an oxidatively damaged GFP reporter gene
in the mutant BRCA1-containing cell line SUM149PT (Fig. 2B).
Likewise, benserazide produced a dose–response increase in
repair of an oxidatively damaged GFP reporter gene in
SUM149PT cells but not in wild-type BRCA1 MCF7 breast
cancer cells. Additional breast cancer cell lines displayed
similar results (Fig. 2D and E) using the same assay. Treatment
of mutant BRCA1-containing cell lines with 20 mmol/L acetohexamide, that is, the highest concentration used in the HT
screen, produced a statistically signiﬁcant increase in BER
(HCC1937, P ¼ 0.01; SUM149, P ¼ 0.007), whereas the same
treatment in wild-type BRCA1-containing cell lines cells exhibited no effect on BER (BT474, P ¼ 0.4; MCF7, P ¼ 0.1; Fig. 2D).
Similarly, treatment of mutant BRCA1-containing cell lines
with 20 mmol/L benserazide produced a statistically signiﬁcant
increase in BER (HCC1937, P ¼ 0.007; SUM1315, P ¼ 0.01),
whereas the same treatment in wild-type BRCA1-containing
cell lines cells resulted in no effect on BER (BT474, P ¼ 0.3;
MCF7, P ¼ 0.5; Fig. 2E). Acetohexamide and benserazide also
decreased basal levels of 8oxoG lesions, that is, the most
common form of ODD, in a time-dependent manner in
SUM149 cells (Fig. 2F and G) and decreased ODD induced by
25 mmol/L H2O2 to levels similar to those of the undamaged
control in 2 breast cancer cell lines with mutant BRCA1 (Fig. 2H
and I). Taken together, these data suggest that acetohexamide
and benserazide are 2 DNA repair-activating agents that
function by enhancing BER of ODD in the presence of mutant,
but not wild-type BRCA1.
Under normal conditions, DNA damage activates mechanisms of DNA repair (26); therefore, we tested whether or not
acetohexamide or benserazide functioned by inducing DNA
damage. When mutant BRCA1-containing cell lines were treated with 0.4 mmol/L acetohexamide or 20 mmol/L benserazide
and then analyzed for DNA strand breaks using the alkaline
comet assay, we found that neither drug induced DNA strand
breaks relative to the vehicle control (Fig. 2J and K). Therefore,
DNA repair–activating agents, acetohexamide and benserazide, increase BER directly, rather than indirectly through
induction of DNA damage.
For purposes of comparison, we also tested the effect of
tamoxifen on BER (due to it being the current FDA-approved
chemoprevention agent for breast cancer). We used the highest
concentration of tamoxifen that did not produce a statistically
signiﬁcant decrease in cell viability in breast cancer cell lines
under our experimental conditions (i.e., 1 mmol/L). Unlike DNA
repair–activating agents, treatment with tamoxifen did not
signiﬁcantly increase repair of an oxidatively damaged GFP
reporter gene in SUM149 cells (P ¼ 0.28; Fig. 2L).
Effect of a DNA repair–activating agent on anchorageindependent growth
Anchorage independence is a characteristic of transformed
cells that often indicates tumorigenic potential. We asked
whether or not DNA repair–activating agents could reduce
anchorage-independent growth. Therefore, we treated breast
cancer cells with benserazide or vehicle control and measured
colony formation in soft agar. Benserazide signiﬁcantly
decreased colony formation in a mutant BRCA1-containing

cell line (HCC1937, P ¼ 0.0003) as well as a wild-type BRCA1containing cell line (MCF7, P ¼ 0.03), with the effect being
signiﬁcantly greater for the mutant BRCA1-containing cell line
than for the wild-type cell line (P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3A). Similarly,
benserazide reduced colony formation in MCF7 cells stably
transduced with shRNA to BRCA1 (P ¼ 0.03) or a nontargeting
control (P ¼ 0.02), with the effect being signiﬁcantly greater in
those cells containing shRNA to BRCA1 compared with the
control (P ¼ 0.005; Fig. 3B). We next assessed whether the
reduction in colony formation was due to a decrease in
anchorage-independent growth or a decrease in cell viability.
Therefore, we carried out the soft agar colony formation assay
in parallel to the trypan blue exclusion assay for the wild-type
and mutant BRCA1-containing cell lines and found that benserazide did not signiﬁcantly affect cell viability in either cell
line (MCF7, P ¼ 0.2; HCC1937, P ¼ 0.4; Fig. 3C).
To compare benserazide with the existing FDA-approved
chemoprevention agent for breast cancer, we also examined
the effect of tamoxifen on anchorage-independent growth
using the soft agar colony formation assay. Tamoxifen showed
no effect on colony formation in mutant BRCA1-containing
cells (HCC1937, P ¼ 0.7) but signiﬁcantly decreased colony
formation in wild-type BRCA1-containing cells (MCF7, P ¼
0.0003; Fig. 3A). Likewise, tamoxifen did not signiﬁcantly
decrease colony formation in MCF7 cells transduced with
shRNA to BRCA1 (P ¼ 0.2) but signiﬁcantly decreased colony
formation in cells with the nontargeting control (P ¼ 0.03;
Fig. 3B). A parallel experiment using the trypan blue exclusion
assay revealed that tamoxifen did not affect cell viability in
either mutant (HCC1937, P ¼ 0.3) or wild-type (MCF7, P ¼ 0.6)
BRCA1-containing cells (Fig. 3C) but rather reduced colony
formation in wild-type BRCA1-containing cells due to a
decrease in anchorage-independent growth.
Taken together, benserazide was more effective than tamoxifen at decreasing the tumorigenic potential of cell lines with
mutant or deﬁcient BRCA1 but not wild-type BRCA1.
Effect of a DNA repair–activating agent on tumor
progression
Tumor progression is the ﬁnal step of tumorigenesis that
allows cells to develop and maintain malignant properties.
Therefore, we carried out an in vivo study to analyze characteristics of tumor progression, including tumor formation,
growth, and metastasis. We used a xenograft mouse model
and began treatment with DNA repair–activating agent 24
hours before inoculation of mutant BRCA1 HCC1937 cells
into the mammary fat pad. Treatment with vehicle control,
50 mg/kg benserazide, or 250 mg/kg benserazide continued
daily for up to 60 days while monitoring for tumor formation
by palpitation. After 60 days (i.e., study endpoint), we
collected serum for analysis of 8oxodG levels, excised and
weighed tumors (if present), and analyzed metastasis by
necropsy. If no tumor was present, mice remained under
surveillance for tumor formation in the absence of treatment
for up to 6 weeks after the study endpoint to distinguish
between unsuccessful tumor inoculation and drug-mediated
effects. Mice that did not form tumors were eliminated from
the data pool presumably due to the lack of tumor uptake

drug. This model system feasibly allowed for completion of
an in vivo study that mimicked chemoprevention rather than
therapeutic conditions.
We found that benserazide delayed the rate of tumor formation in mice in a dose–response manner (Fig. 3D). Compared
with the vehicle control, treatment with 50 and 250 mg/kg
benserazide increased the percentage of tumor-free mice over
time (P ¼ 0.27 and 0.047, respectively). We also discovered that
benserazide reduced tumor growth as evidenced by a dose–
response decrease in the average weight of tumors at the study
endpoint (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, benserazide simultaneously
increased serum levels of 8oxodG (Fig. 3F), a byproduct of DNA
repair of ODD. Indeed, the average tumor weight negatively

correlated with the average serum levels of 8oxodG among

tumor growth was proportional to benserazide-mediated BER.
Finally, unlike the vehicle control, both concentrations of benserazide prevented metastasis (Fig. 3G).
Analysis of the molecular target of benserazide
Benserazide and its analogue, carbidopa (Fig. 4A), are both
known to function as DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors. Benserazide and carbidopa were also both included among the
compounds screened for BER-enhancing activity (Fig. 1). However, our screen did not identify carbidopa as a hit (Fig. 4B).
Therefore, we ﬁrst validated our screening data by subjecting
the mutant BRCA1-containing SUM149 cell line to the BER

assay following pretreatment with vehicle control or carbidopa. Given that benserazide is typically administered at
approximately half the dose of carbidopa (27), we used carbidopa at the dose equivalent to the effective dose of benserazide
(10 mmol/L) and at the highest screened concentration or twice
the effective dose of benserazide (20 mmol/L). Indeed, carbidopa exhibited no effect on repair activity compared with the
vehicle control (10 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.4; 20 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.3; Fig. 4C).
We next asked whether carbidopa had an effect on tumorigenic
potential by measuring anchorage-independent growth.
The soft agar colony formation assay revealed that compared
with the vehicle control, treatment with 10 or 20 mmol/L
carbidopa had no signiﬁcant effect on colony formation
of MCF7 cells transduced with either shRNA to BRCA1
(10 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.09; 20 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.1) or a nontargeting
control (10 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.7; 20 mmol/L, P ¼ 0.4; Fig. 4D). Taken
together, unlike benserazide, its carbidopa analogue does not
function as a DNA repair–activating agent or decrease anchorage-independent growth. These data suggest that the benserazide-mediated effects on BER of ODD and tumorigenic
potential are independent of DOPA decarboxylase inhibition.

Discussion
BRCA1 mutation or deﬁciency leads to defective BER and
excessive ODD (23, 24), which, in turn, leads to tumorigenesis.
We have discovered small molecules that enhance BER of ODD
and reduce malignant properties associated with tumorigen-

esis, including anchorage-independent growth and tumor
progression. While previous studies have reported small molecules that inhibit DNA repair (28), this study, to our knowledge,
reports small molecules that activate repair for the ﬁrst time.
These DNA repair–activating agents may potentially be used
for the chemoprevention of BRCA1-associated malignancies.
A high-throughput chemical screen identiﬁed a novel class
of drugs termed "DNA repair–activating agents." We pursued
two of these agents, acetohexamide and benserazide, because
of their predicted activity, lack of potential cytotoxicity, and
clinical potential. Both acetohexamide and benserazide
enhanced BER (Fig. 2B and E) as well as decreased basal levels
and H2O2-induced levels of ODD (Fig. 2F–I). These effects were
observed in a dose–response and/or time-dependent manner
and were speciﬁc to mutant BRCA1-containing cells. Neither
drug induced DNA damage, including single- or double-strand
breaks (Fig. 2J and K), suggesting that the ability to enhance
DNA repair was due to direct means as opposed to indirect
means of damage-induced repair. Both acetohexamide and
benserazide also exhibited minimal cytotoxicity at concentrations that enhanced BER of ODD (Fig. 3C and Supplementary
Fig. S5) and lacked chemical, toxicologic, and environmental
health concerns according to the U.S. National Library of
Medicine TOXNET database. Furthermore, we derived DNA
repair–activating agents by screening compounds with known
pharmacologic activity, thereby facilitating their translation
into the clinic. For example, acetohexamide and benserazide
have already been through human trials and have been

approved for clinical use in the United States for diabetes and
in the United Kingdom and Canada for Parkinson disease,
respectively. Taken together, DNA repair–activating agents
may potentially be repurposed to reverse a defect in DNA
repair associated with BRCA1-mediated tumorigenesis.
The DNA repair–activating agent benserazide decreased
malignant properties associated with tumorigenesis. Our data
showed that compared with vehicle controls, benserazide
reduced anchorage-independent growth in vitro as well as
delayed tumor formation and decreased the average weight
of tumors in vivo when administered before tumor implantation (Fig. 3A–D). We observed a statistically signiﬁcant
decrease in the rate of tumor formation for mice treated with
the higher dose (250 mg/kg) but not the lower dose (50 mg/kg)
of benserazide. The lack of a statistically signiﬁcant difference
in the latter case may have been due to small sample sizes.
Nonetheless, the effects of benserazide on tumor formation
and growth occurred in a dose–response manner. Importantly,
an increase in levels of a serum marker for repair of ODD
(8oxodG) correlated with the decrease in tumor weight in mice
treated with benserazide (r ¼ 0.82; Fig. 3E and F). On the
other hand, carbidopa, a benserazide analogue, did not exhibit
BER activity (Fig. 4B and C) and did not reduce in vitro
tumorigenic potential (Fig. 4D). Together, these data provide
evidence for a link between enhancing BER and preventing
tumorigenesis. Interestingly, treatment with benserazide also
prevented metastasis (Fig. 3G), suggesting that DNA repair–
activating agents may not only be useful before a cancer
diagnosis for chemopreventive purposes but also after a diagnosis for the treatment of BRCA1-mutated breast cancers.
Through its role in maintaining genetic stability, BRCA1 has
been implicated in both the initiation and progression steps of
tumorigenesis (21, 29, 30). However, we only captured data for
tumor progression because our assays used cancer cell lines
that have already undergone tumor initiation. It remains
possible that benserazide or other DNA repair–activating
agents compensate for mutant BRCA1 function at the earlier
step of tumor initiation. A model system that uses primary
cultures with a single BRCA1 mutation or a mouse model with a
conditional Brca1 mutation (31) will better serve to answer this
question, but unfortunately, these models are limited by
uncertainties of tumor formation and long latency periods.
Furthermore, we avoided data that were skewed in favor of
treatment-mediated effects due to our use of established cell
lines by monitoring for tumor formation after the study
endpoint and eliminating data obtained from mice that did
not successfully experience tumor uptake upon inoculation.
Our study suggests that DNA repair–activating agents may
provide a better option than tamoxifen for the chemoprevention of BRCA1-associated breast cancers. While benserazide
signiﬁcantly enhanced BER of ODD (Fig. 2C, E, G, and I) and
decreased malignant properties associated with tumorigenesis
(Fig. 3A, B, and D–F), tamoxifen did not enhance BER of ODD in
BRCA1-mutant cells (Fig. 2L), nor did it effectively reduce
tumorigenic potential in BRCA1-mutant or -deﬁcient cells
(Fig. 3A and B). However, tamoxifen signiﬁcantly reduced
tumorigenic potential in wild-type BRCA1-containing cells
(Fig. 3A and B), which is consistent with published studies

www.aacrjournals.org

that examined its effectiveness in breast cancer populations
(14). The use of tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention is often
avoided by patients because it increases the risk for endometrial carcinoma (32–36). While tamoxifen is a well-established
carcinogen, neither acetohexamide nor benserazide has been
reported to exhibit carcinogenic potential (37, 38). Therefore,
DNA repair–activating agents provide an added advantage to
carriers of BRCA1 mutations who are naturally susceptible to
carcinogen-induced DNA damage.
The molecular target(s) of DNA repair–activating agents
that are responsible for enhancing BER remain unknown.
Given that the chemical screen used to identify these agents
used a library of compounds with known pharmacologic
activity, DNA repair–activating agents have well-established
molecular targets. However, the molecular targets responsible
for BER-enhancing activity are independent of their established targets because functional analogues of DNA repair–
activating agents do not enhance BER or prevent tumorigenic
potential. Both benserazide (used in the United Kingdom and
Canada) and carbidopa (the equivalent used in the United
States) target DOPA decarboxylase in the periphery. There is no
signiﬁcant difference in the therapeutic effects for Parkinson
disease between these two drugs (27). However, unlike benserazide (Figs. 2C, E, G, I and 3), carbidopa did not enhance BER,
nor did it reduce tumorigenic potential (Fig. 4). Likewise, the
chemical screen used to identify DNA repair–activating agents
(Fig. 1A and B) tested 6 sulfonylureas that stimulate insulin
release via ATP-dependent Kþ channels, but only two of these
antidiabetic molecules, acetohexamide (strong hit) and glipizide (weak hit), showed BER-enhancing activity (Figs. 2B, D, F,
H and Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, if acetohexamide functioned through its known/antidiabetic mechanism,
one would predict all sulfonylureas to reduce the risk for breast
cancer, which is not the case (39). Examination of an NCBI GEO
dataset for MCF7 cells treated with benserazide revealed an
upregulation of BER genes previously shown to be transcriptionally activated by BRCA1, including OGG1 by 35-fold, NTH1
by 130-fold, and APE1 by 1049-fold (24, 40). Therefore, DNA
repair–activating agents may function by increasing the
expression of one of these molecules, although it is unlikely
to be OGG1 given that we found no signiﬁcant difference in the
effect of benserazide or acetohexamide on BER activity
between shOGG1-containing and nontargeting control MCF7
cells (data not shown). Because these data reﬂect activity in the
presence of wild-type BRCA1, extensive studies are underway
to reveal the molecular targets of DNA repair–activating agents
in mutant BRCA1-containing cells. DNA repair–activating
agents are expected to directly or indirectly target a required
enzyme(s)/protein for BER rather than an accessory protein
because these agents were identiﬁed using an endpoint (not
rate-determining) assay for BER (ref. 23 and Fig. 1A). They may
inhibit a negative regulator of BER, as most drugs function
through inhibition, or they may activate any positive regulator
of BER. For example, evidence suggests that altering protein–
protein interactions or the acetylation state of APEX1 endonuclease may stimulate BER activity (41). Although DNA
repair–activating agents were identiﬁed using an assay that
enriched for molecules that alter BER activity, ODD may

convert to single- or double-strand breaks, and thus DNA
repair–activating agents may alter other repair processes in
which BRCA1 also plays a role, such as homologous recombination, nonhomologous end-joining, or nucleotide excision
repair (42–46). However, this possibility is unlikely due to our
ﬁnding that both benserazide and acetohexamide reduced
levels of ODD (Fig. 2F–I) and not strand breaks (Fig. 2J and K).
In summary, this study describes a novel class of drugs that
target a defect in repair associated with mutations in BRCA1.
Our data suggest that these drugs, that is, DNA repair–activating agents, may be used to prevent or slow the progression
of primary or secondary breast tumors or even delay metastasis. Therefore, these ﬁndings support further studies to
evaluate the use of DNA repair–activating agents for the
chemoprevention of BRCA1-mutated cancers. Clinical studies
are best suited following the development of better chemoprevention models for BRCA1-mutated cancers and upon a
better understanding of the molecular targets of these drugs.
However, benserazide is typically administered with L-DOPA
and has little effect on its own and thus is primed for clinical
translation. Other DNA repair–activating agents should ﬁrst
undergo structure–activity relationship studies to identify an
appropriate analogue that maintains its DNA repair activity
without any adverse effects. For example, acetohexamide
should undergo modiﬁcation to eliminate its glucose-lowering
activity to minimize the possibility of inducing hypoglycemia
in healthy patients being treated for cancer prevention. Finally,
these drugs may be effective for other malignancies associated
with oxidative stress, including other cancers, degenerative
diseases, and sclerotic disorders.
