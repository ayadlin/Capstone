ABSTRACT
We recently showed that imbalance of TGF-β/Smad signaling with over-activation
of Smad3 but lower levels of Smad7 is a central mechanism of tissue fibrosis. In the
present study, we report here that inhibition of Smad3 with naringenin (NG) and
upregulation of Smad7 with asiatic acid (AA) produced an additive effect on inhibition
of renal fibrosis in a mouse model of obstructive nephropathy. We found that AA, a
triterpene from Centella Asiatica, functioned as a Smad7 agonist and suppressed
TGF-β/Smad3-mediated renal fibrosis by inducing Smad7. Whereas, NG, a flavonoid
from grapefruits and citrus fruits, was a Smad3 inhibitor that inhibited renal fibrosis
by blocking Smad3 phosphorylation and transcription. The combination of AA and NG
produced an additive effect on inhibition of renal fibrosis by blocking Smad3 while
upregulating Smad7. Thus, rebalancing the disorder of TGF-β/Smad signaling by
treatment with AA and NG may represent as a novel and effective therapy for chronic
kidney disease associated with fibrosis.

INTRODUCTION

therapeutic approach due to the diverse roles of TGF-β1
in inflammation and fibrosis. Although blockade of the
upstream TGF-β signaling inhibits fibrosis, it may also
promote inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that
treatment of renal fibrosis should target the downstream
TGF-β/Smad signaling associated with fibrosis, rather
than to block the general effect of TGF-β1.
Increasing evidence shows that TGF-β/Smad
signaling is a central pathway leading to renal fibrogenesis
[1]. It is now clear that TGF-β1 promotes fibrosis
positively by activating its downstream molecule Smad3,
not Smad2, but negatively by an inhibitory Smad7 [2, 11].
In the context of fibrosis, Smad3 is pathogenic, which
is supported by the finding that mice lacking Smad3 are
protected against tissue fibrosis in chronic kidney and
cardiac diseases [12-15]. In contrast, Smad7 is protective
during fibrosis as deletion of Smad7 promotes, but
overexpression of Smad7 inhibits, tissue fibrosis [16-19].
Thus, the imbalance of TGF-β/Smad signaling may be a
major cause of renal fibrosis and rebalancing this pathway

Renal fibrosis, characterized by the accumulation
of myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), is
a major cause of the end-stage renal disease. However,
treatment of renal fibrosis remains non-specific and
ineffective clinically. Increasing evidence shows that
TGF-β1 is a key mediator of renal fibrosis [1-5]. Many
studies have attempted to develop anti-fibrosis therapy
by inhibiting the upstream of TGF-β signaling, including
antisense TGF-β oligodeoxynucleotides, neutralizing
antibodies, and inhibitors to TGF-β receptor (TβR) kinases
in a variety of kidney disease models [2, 6-8]. However,
treatment of puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy
with a high dose of anti-TGF-β antibody produces no
renoprotective effect [9], which is consistent with a
recent finding that disruption of TGF-β type II receptor
decreased renal fibrosis but enhanced renal inflammation
[10]. Results from these studies suggest that inhibiting
the upstream of TGF-β signaling may not be an optimal

by inactivating Smad3 while upregulating Smad7 may
produce a better therapeutic effect on renal fibrosis.
Asiatic Acid (AA), a triterpenoid component
extracted from Centella asiatica [20], has been shown
to have a variety of pharmacological effects including
anti-inflammation [21], anti-oxidation [22] and antifibrosis [23, 24]. We recently found that AA exerts its
anti-fibrotic effects on liver fibrosis by inducing Smad7
[23]. Naringenin (NG) is a flavonoid from grapefruit
and citrus fruits with anti-inflammatory properties in a
number of disease conditions including atherosclerosis
and diabetes [25-27]. NG is also found to inhibit TGF-β/
Smad3 signaling and tissue fibrosis including epithelialmesenchymal transition in a number of disease models
[28, 29]. Based on these observations, we therefore
hypothesized that the combination of AA and NG may
produce a better therapeutic effect on renal fibrosis by
more effectively correcting the imbalance of TGF-β/
Smad signaling, namely upregulation of Smad7 while
suppressing Smad3. The hypothesis was examined in the
present study in vitro and in a well-characterized mouse
model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO).

1c).

After determining an effective and safe dosage of
AA, NG, and their combination use, the mechanisms
of drugs actions were examined in TGF-β1-stimulated
TECs. Real-time PCR and Western blot showed that
addition of AA induced upregulation of Smad7 at both
mRNA and protein levels, which was associated with
inhibition of Smad3 phosphorylation but not expression
(Figure 1a, Figure 2). These observations suggested that
AA acts by inducing Smad7 to inhibit TGF-β1-induced
Smad3 signaling. Similarly, addition of NG was capable
of blocking TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad3
(Figs.1b and Figure 2b). Interestingly, NG also inhibited
expression of Smad3 in both mRNA and protein levels
(Figure 2); however, treatment with NG failed to induce
Smad7 transcription (Figure 2a ii), revealing that NG
inhibits TGF-β/Smad3 signaling by blocking Smad3
phosphorylation and transcription.
Because AA and NG acted by different mechanisms
to inhibit TGF-β/Smad signaling, we tested if the
combination of AA and NG produces a better inhibitory
effect on TGF-β/Smad signaling and fibrosis. As shown in
Figure 2, although the combination of AA (20µM) and NG
(50µM) produced little additive effect on mRNA levels
of Smad3 or Smad7 (Figure 2a i, ii), TGF-β1-induced
phosphorylation of Smad3 and expression of Smurf2 were
additively suppressed (Figure 2b). Real-time PCR and
Western blot revealed that the combined treatment with
AA and NG also produced an additive inhibitory effect
on TGF-β1-induced collagen I and α-SMA expression
in TGF-β1-stimulated TECs (Figure 3). However, the
combination of AA and NG produced no additive effect
on inhibition of TGF-β1 mRNA expression (Figure 2a iii).

RESULTS
Combination of AA and NG produces a better
effect on restoring the balance of TGF-β/Smad
signaling and inhibiting TGF-β1-induced fibrosis
in vitro
We first determined an effective and safe dosage of
AA and NG in vitro, in which a better effect on restoring
the balance of TGF-β/Smad signaling and inhibiting
fibrosis without cytotoxicity was achieved. As shown in
Figure 1A, phosphorylation of Smad3 was significantly
induced in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) at 30
minutes after addition of TGF-β1 (2ng/ml), which was
significantly inhibited by over-night pre-incubation
with AA at dosages of 20 μM and 30μM (Figure 1a).
Similarly, addition of NG was also able to block TGFβ1-induced activation of Smad3 in a dosage-dependent
manner, with significant dosages over 50µM (Figure 1b).
We then examined the cytotoxic response to AA or NG
in cultured TECs. As shown in Figure 1c and 1d, lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) releasing assay and MTT assay
detected that AA at concentrations over 30µM caused
significant cytotoxicity and largely decreased cell viability
of TECs. In contrast, the cytotoxic and anti-proliferation
effects of NG were undetectable with the concentration
range from 25μM to 400μM (Figure 1c and 1d). Taken
together, AA at 20μM and NG at 50μM were selected
as an effective and safe dosage for the in vitro study.
Furthermore, the combination of AA (20µM) and NG
(50µM) also produced no cytotoxicity to TECs (Figure

Combination treatment with AA and NG produces
a better anti-fibrotic effect on UUO nephropathy
in vivo
We next examined if the combination of AA and
NG also produced a better inhibitory effect on renal
fibrosis in a well-established mouse model of UUO. We
first determined an optimal dosage of AA and NG and
their combination for a better anti-fibrosis effect without
toxicity in a mouse model of UUO. As shown in Figure 4,
daily intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of AA for 7 days was
able to inhibit collagen I expression in the UUO kidney in
a dose-dependent manner, with a better inhibitory effect at
dosages of 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight (BW). In addition,
i.p. injection of NG also dose-independently inhibited
collagen I production in the UUO kidney, with an optimal
dosage at 50 mg/kg BW. Thus, AA at 5mg/kg BW and NG
at 50 mg/kg BW were selected as a single or combination
treatment for renal fibrosis in a mouse model of UUO.
To determine the potential toxicity of selected
dosages of AA, NG, and their combination in vivo, we

single treatment with AA or NG significantly inhibited
total collagen-like matrix deposition in the injured kidney,
which was further improved by the combination treatment
(Figure 5a and 5d). Immunohistochemistry also revealed
that the combination treatment with AA and NG further
decreased the accumulation of collagen I and α-SMA+
myofibroblasts within the UUO kidney when compared
with the individual treatment alone (Figure 5b, 5c, 5e, 5f).
This was further confirmed at the mRNA levels by realtime PCR and at the total kidney protein levels by western

treated groups of 4 normal mice with AA (5mg/kg BW),
NG (50mg/kg BW), and their combination for 7 days
and collected serum for LDH release assay and 24-hour
urine samples for measuring urinary albumin excretion.
As shown in Figure 4c, serum levels of LDH and urinary
albumin concentrations were not altered after treatment
with AA, NG, and their combination. In addition, no
histological abnormalities were noticed based on H&E and
PAS-staining (no shown).
We then determined the therapeutic efficacy of AA,
NG, and their combination in a mouse model of UUO as

was further suppressed by the combination of AA and
NG. Consistent with the findings in vitro, the inhibitory
effect of AA on Smad3 signaling in the UUO kidney was
correlated with a significant upregulation of renal Smad7
at both mRNA and protein levels without altering Smad3
mRNA and protein expression (Figure 7). In contrast,
blockade of Smad3 signaling with NG was associated with
downregulation of Smad3 at both mRNA ad protein levels
without altering Smad7 mRNA and protein levels (Figure

DISCUSSION

further suppressing Smad3 signaling while inducing
Smad7 mRNA expression as well as preventing Smad7
protein from degradation by decreasing Smurf2 (Figure
7a, 7b).
Consistent with our previous finding that there was
a markedly upregulation of miR-21 but downregulation
of miR-29b in the UUO kidney [38, 39]. Interestingly,
treatment with either AA or NG significantly reduced
miR-21 expression, which was further suppressed when
animals were treated with the combination of AA and NG
(Figure 8b). A similar result was also found in the cultured
TECs in which the combination treatment with AA and
NG resulted in further inhibition of miR-21 expression
(Figure 8c). However, treatment with AA, NG or the
combination did not alter the expression of miR-29b in
the UUO kidney and in vitro (Figure 8d).

Increasing evidence shows that TGF-β1/Smad
signaling is a central pathway leading to tissue fibrosis
[1, 2]. It is now clear that Smad3 is a key fibrogenic
mediator and is highly activated during renal fibrosis. In
contrast, Smad7, an inhibitor of TGF-β/Smad3 signaling,
is lost in the scarring kidney [2]. In the present study, we
identified that AA, a purified compound from Centella
asiatica [20], is a Smad7 agonist, whereas NG, a flavonoid
from grapefruit and citrus fruits [28], functioned as a
Smad3 inhibitor. The combination of these two purified
Traditional Chinese Medicine compounds significantly
enhanced the inhibitory effect on TGF-β/Smad signaling
and renal fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. Outcomes from this
study suggested that restoring the balance of downstream
TGF-β/Smad signaling with AA (a Smad7 agonist) and
NG (a Smad3 inhibitor) may represent a new therapeutic

approach for chronic kidney disease associated with
progressive renal fibrosis.
The identification of NG as a Smad3 inhibitor and
AA as a Smad7 agonist was an important finding in the
present study. Consistent with the consensus that Smad3
stimulates tissue fibrosis in a number of chronic kidney
diseases [12, 13], inhibition of Smad3 transcription
and phosphorylation was a mechanism through which
NG inhibits fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. This finding
was consistent with other studies in which inhibition of
Smad3 with SIS3 (a Smad3 inhibitor to block Smad3
DNA binding and phosphorylation) and GQ5 (a small
compound isolated from the dried resin of Toxicodendron
vernicifluum that blocks the binding of Smad3 to
TGF-β type I receptor) attenuates renal fibrosis [30,
31]. Interestingly, addition of NG blocks Smad3 mRNA
and protein expression without altering levels of Smad7
expression, indicating a specific effect of NG on inhibiting
Smad3 without influencing Smad7. In the present study,
we also found that addition of AA was capable of blocking
Smad3 phosphorylation and renal fibrosis by upregulating
Smad7 without altering expression of Smad3, identifying
AA as a Smad7 agonist to inhibit Smad3 signaling by
inducing Smad7 transcription. This finding was consistent
with our previous study that treatment with AA inhibits
liver fibrosis by inducing Smad7 [23]. It is well accepted
that Smad7 is an inhibitor of Smad3 signaling and protects
against tissue fibrosis in a number of diseases [17, 32-35].
However, Smad7 is lost in the fibrosing tissue, which is
induced by Smurf2, an E3 ligase that targets Smad7 for
ubiquitin degradation [36, 37]. It is reported that TGF-β1
induces Smurf2 expression via a Smad3-dependent
mechanism [37]. Thus, the combination treatment with
AA and NG produced a better inhibitory effect on Smad3
signaling via direct and indirect mechanisms.
We have previously shown that TGF-β/Smad3
mediates renal fibrosis by upregulating miR-21 but
downregulating miR-29b in the UUO and diabetic
nephropathy [38-41]. In the present study, we found that
treatment with AA or NG also produced an additive effect
on inhibition of miR-21 expression. However, treatment
with AA and NG did not alter the expression of miR-29b
in vivo and in vitro. Thus, inhibition of miR-21 expression
may also account for a mechanism whereby AA, NG, and
their combination treatment inhibited renal fibrosis.
The combination of AA and NG also allowed using
lower dosages of AA and NG, which prevented the drug
cytotoxicity while enhancing the therapeutic efficacy on
renal fibrosis. Indeed, a single use of AA or NG induced
an inhibition of Smad3 signaling in a dosage-dependent
manner; however, it also caused the anti-proliferation
effect and cytotoxicity when higher dosages were used.
The combination of AA and NG allowed lowering
the dosages of individual drugs to produce a safer but
effective therapy for renal fibrosis without cytotoxicity.
This is important since the cytotoxicity has been a major
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

problem for the clinical application of the Traditional
Chinese Medicine [42].
In summary, the present study demonstrates that AA
functions as a Smad7 agonist and inhibits Smad3 signaling
by inducing Smad7; whereas NG is a Smad3 inhibitor and
blocks Smad3 signaling directly by inhibiting Smad3
phosphorylation and transcription. Thus, the combination
of AA and NG produces an additive effect on inhibition
of renal fibrosis by inhibiting Smad3 while upregulating
Smad7 and may represent as a novel and effective
therapy for chronic kidney disease including diabetic and
hypertensive nephropathy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A mouse model of UUO and treatment
A mouse model of UUO was established in C57BL6
male mice (6 weeks of age, 20-22g) by ligating the
left ureter as previously described [11]. Animals were
randomly divided into 5 groups including Sham, UUO
with vehicle control (DMSO) or treated with AA, NG, and
the combination of AA plus NG. AA was a HLPC-purified
product (95%) purchased from Guangxi Changzhou
Natural Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (Nanning, Guangxi,
China). NG was obtained from Shanxi Huike Botanical
Development Co. Ltd (Xian, Shanxi, China) with the
HLPC-purity of 98%. Either AA or NG was dissolved in
1% DMSO and was administrated into mouse daily via
intraperitoneal (i.p) injection. Briefly, after UUO surgery,
groups of 8 mice were housed in the Animal Facility of
Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) with a 12/12hour light/dark cycle and food and water available and
received daily i.p. injections of control saline containing
1% DMSO, an optimal dose of AA at 5 mg/kg/boy weight
(BW) and NG at 50 mg/kg/BW, or the combination of AA
(5mg/kg/BW) plus NG (50 mg/kg/BW) for seven days.
Kidney tissues were harvested and examined for renal
fibrosis. The experimental procedures were approved by
the Animal Ethics Committee of The CUHK.

Determination of an optimal dose of AA, NG, and
their combination ratio in vitro and in vivo
We first determined an optimal dosage of AA,
NG, and their combination with the maximal inhibitory
effect on TGF-β1/Smad signaling without cytotoxicity
in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, a normal rat kidney tubular
epithelial cell line (NRK52E) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM)-F12 medium
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After
being fasted, cells were incubated with AA (dissolved
in 1% DMSO) at dosages of 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 μM
and NG at dosages of 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 μM for

24 hours. The supernatant from individual treatments was
then collected for testing the cytotoxicity by the lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) releasing assay with a LDH release
kit (BioVision Technologies, Exton, PA, USA) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. After determining safe
dosages of AA and NG, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect
of AA and NG on TGF-β/Smad signaling was performed
in NRK52E cells with addition of a recombinant human
TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA)
for periods of 0, 30 min, 3h, 6h, and 24h following the 24hour pre-incubation with the safe dosages of AA or NG.
At least three-independent experiments were performed
and 1% DMSO was used as control for all studies. Then,
a safe and effective dose of AA and NG was selected for
in vitro study.
Effective dosages of AA and NG for renal fibrosis
were determined in groups of 4 mice with UUO by daily
i.p injection of AA at dosages of 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, and 10
mg/kg body weight or NG at dosages of 12.5, 25, 50, and
100 mg/kg body weight for 7 days. A dose-dependent
inhibitory effect of AA and NG on renal fibrosis was
determined by western blot analysis of collagen I
expression. After selecting an effective dosage for AA
and NG, we performed a toxicity test in vivo in groups
of 4 normal mice by a daily i.p. injection of DMSO, AA
(5mg/kg BW), NG (50mg/kg BW), and their combination
AA (5mg/kg/BW) plus NG (50 mg/kg/BW) for 7 days,
respectively. Blood plasma was collected at day 7 after
the treatment for the LDH releasing assay and 24-hour
urinary samples were collected in the metabolism cages.
Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) assay was performed by
using competitive ELISA according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Exocell, Philadelphia, PA, USA).

RNA extraction and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from kidney tissues
and cultured cells using the RNeasy Isolation Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using the BioRad iQ SYBR Green supermix with Opticon2 (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) as previously described [16]. The primers
used in the current study including mouse collagen I,
α-SMA, TGF-β1, Smad7, Smurf2 and glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were described
previously [35, 44]. In addition, expression of miR-21
and miR-29b expression in cultured TECs and in the UUO
kidney was measured by real-time PCR with primers as
previously described [38, 39]. The ratio for the mRNA of
interest was normalized to GAPDH and expressed as the
mean ± standard errors of the mean (SEM).

Western blot analysis
Proteins from kidney tissues and cultured cells
were extracted with RIPA lysis buffer, and western blot
analysis was performed as described previously [10].
After blocking the nonspeciﬁc binding with 5% BSA
(1h, room temperature), membranes were then incubated
with the primary antibody against phospho-Smad3 (Cell
Signaling Technology), collagen I (Southern Biotech),
Smad7, Smurf2, total Smad3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
α-SMA, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase

the IRDye 800-conjugated secondary antibody (Rockland
immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA). Signals were
captured using the LiCor/Odyssey infrared image system
(LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and the intensity of
each band was quantiﬁed and analyzed by using the Image

Tek Laboratoris, West Logan, UT) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Immunohistochemistry for
detection of TGF-β/Smad signaling and renal fibrosis was
performed in 4μm paraffin-embedded tissue sections of
mouse kidney tissue using a microwave-based antigen
retrieval technique [43]. Primary antibodies used in this
study included rabbit polyclonal antibodies to TGF-β1,
phosphorylated Smad2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA), collagen I (Southern Biotech,
Birmingham, AL), α-SMA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The
number of phospho-Smad2/3 was counted under highpower fields (×40) by means of a 0.0625-mm2 graticule
fitted in the eyepiece of the microscope and expressed
as cells per millimeters squared. The total collagen-like
contents, expression of TGF-β1, and accumulation of

Urinary albumin excretion
To determine the potential toxicity to the kidney, 24hour urinary samples from groups of 4 normal mice were
collected in the metabolic cages after treatment with AA,
NG, and their combination for 7 days. Urinary albumin
excretion was measured by competitive ELISA according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Exocell, PA). Urinary
creatinine was measured by an enzymatic kit (Stanbio
Labs, TX). Urinary albumin excretion was expressed as
