ABSTRACT
Despite great efforts taken to advance therapeutic measures for patients with
glioblastoma, the clinical prognosis remains grim. The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
protein Mcl-1 is overexpressed in glioblastoma and represents an important resistance
factor to the BH-3 mimetic ABT263.
In this study, we show that combined treatment with ABT263 and GX15-070
overcomes apoptotic resistance in established glioblastoma cell lines, glioma stemlike cells and primary cultures. Moreover, this treatment regimen also proves to
be advantageous in vivo. On the molecular level, GX15-070 enhanced apoptosis by
posttranslational down-regulation of the deubiquitinase, Usp9X, and the chaperone
Bag3, leading to a sustained depletion of Mcl-1 protein levels. Moreover, knock-down
of Usp9X or Bag3 depleted endogenous Mcl-1 protein levels and in turn enhanced
apoptosis induced through Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition.
In conclusion, combined treatment with ABT263 and GX15-070 results in a
significantly enhanced anti-cancer activity in vitro as well as in vivo in the setting
of glioblastoma. Both drugs, ABT263 and GX15-070 have been evaluated in clinical
studies which facilitates the translational aspect of taking this combinatorial approach
to the clinical setting. Furthermore we present a novel mechanism by which GX15070 counteracts Mcl-1 expression which may lay a foundation for a novel target in
cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

the identification of oncogenes, which were found to be
frequently dysregulated in this disease [2-5]. The highly
heterogeneous nature of glioblastoma and mechanisms
of inherent or acquired resistance such as cross talk
between different signaling pathways are likely to largely
contribute to this phenomenon [6]. Therefore, strategies
overcoming mechanisms of resistance are a logical and
urgently needed step to advance the development of more
efficient therapeutic approaches.

The prognosis for patients with glioblastoma is grim
[1]. Great efforts have been taken to improve therapeutic
means and thus survival. However, since the introduction
of temozolomide, no further therapeutic approach followed
to enter clinical application and to lead to a substantial
improvement of the fate of glioma patients. This fact also
holds true for many targeted therapies that were based on

RESULTS

The B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins
are important regulators of apoptosis and consist of proand anti-apoptotic members [7]. Dysregulation of this
balanced system represents an important feature in cancer
[8]. As a consequence targeted agents were developed to
manipulate an anti-apoptotic dysbalance in the sense of
shifting the cellular homeostasis of cancer cells towards
apoptosis. ABT-compounds such as ABT737 or ABT263
target the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2, BclxL and Bcl-w and promote apoptosis by inhibiting the
sequestration of the pro-apoptotic multidomain effectors
BAX and BAK which subsequently oligomerize leading
to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the
release of cytochrome c into the cytosol.
However, presence or even compensatory upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), another
anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, was shown
to confer resistance towards the treatment with ABTcompounds [9, 10]. In addition, in silico analysis based
on the TCGA data set revealed a 5-fold overexpression of
Mcl-1 mRNA in glioblastoma when compared to normal
brain (Supplementary Figure 1) suggesting that Mcl1 represents a valid target in this disease. GX15-070 is
a small-molecule inhibitor of Mcl-1 and was shown to
overcome Mcl-1-mediated resistance in oral carcinoma
and murine melanoma cells [11]. Both, ABT-compounds
as well as GX15-070, mimic the role of pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins such as BAD, NOXA or PUMA sharing
a conserved dimerization motif called Bcl-2 homology 3
(BH3).
With this study, we examined whether combined
treatment with the two BH3-mimetics ABT263 and
GX15-070 may represent a valuable therapeutic approach
in the setting of glioblastoma. Our data show that the
combination therapy with ABT263 and GX15-070 yields
a synergistic antiproliferative effect on established and
glioma stem-like cells. In addition, in a heterotopic murine
xenograft model this combination treatment resulted in
a significant reduction in tumor size when compared to
single-agent treatments or control and therefore holds
promise as a novel therapeutic strategy in this disease. On
the molecular level, we show that down-regulation of the
Mcl-1 chaperone Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain 3
(Bag3) and the deubiquitinase Ubiquitin-specific peptidase
9, X-linked (Usp9X) represent a novel mechanism
responsible for GX15-070-mediated down-regulation of
Mcl-1.

Combined treatment with ABT263 and GX15-070
yields a synergistic antiproliferative effect
To test our hypothesis that combined treatment with
the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT263 (Figure 1A) and the Mcl-1
inhibitor GX15-070 (Figure 1A) yields a more favorable
antineoplastic activity in glioblastoma when compared
to single-agent treatments, we first examined effects on
cellular proliferation by MTT assays. As shown in Figure
1B, combined treatment with ABT263 and GX15-070
resulted in a marked cooperative antiproliferative effect
for all tested glioblastoma cells. Statistical analysis using
the Bliss equation revealed that, except for NCH421K, in
all other established glioblastoma cell lines, glioma stemlike cells or primary cultures, the combination therapy
with ABT263 and GX15-070 inhibited proliferation
in a synergistic manner (Figure 1C). In NCH421K, the
combination therapy yielded an additive effect.

GX15-070 enhances the pro-apoptotic effect of
ABT263 on cellular and molecular levels
As
microscopic
imaging
showed,
the
antiproliferative effect of the combination treatment was
accompanied by another prominent finding. Cellular
morphology was observed to be markedly changed in
cells treated with both agents displaying a reduction of
cytoplasmic processes as the most pronounced feature
(Figure 1D). The morphological appearance pointed
towards apoptosis as mechanism. To clarify this suspicion,
we performed staining for propidium iodide and flow
cytometric analysis. Combined treatment with ABT263
and GX15-070 resulted in a dose-dependent increase of
the sub-G1 fraction (apoptotic cells) of U87MG, U87EGFRvIII, T98G, LN229 and U251 glioblastoma cells
when compared to single-agent treatment or control
(Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 2). Similar results
were found in two glioblastoma primary cultures - GS96 and 2927T2 (Figure 2E). Staining for annexin V APC
was performed, further confirming the enhancement of
apoptosis by the combination therapy using an independent
and more apoptosis-specific method (Figure 2B and 2C).
To address the question whether the intrinsic pathway
of apoptosis is involved, changes to the mitochondrial
membrane potential were examined. Our data show that
the combined treatment yields an enhanced reduction of
the mitochondrial membrane potential in U87MG cells
when compared to cells treated with either agent alone
or solvent thus, underlining the role of intrinsic apoptosis
(Figure 2D).

equaled 0.9 to 1.1, additivity was assumed. If this quotient was less than 0.9, the effect was described as antagonistic. Synergism was stated
if the quotient was greater than 1.1. D. representative microphotographs of U87-EGFRvIII and T98G cells at indicated magnifications after

the induction of apoptosis on the cellular level we
examined the response at the molecular level. Therefore,
Western blot analyses for activation of caspases 9 and
3 were conducted in U87MG, LN229, T98G and U373

glioblastoma cells. In all these cell lines, the combination
therapy resulted in markedly enhanced cleavage of
initiator caspase 9 and effector caspase 3 (Figure 3A-3D).

drug exposure, representative images were taken and
analysed. Only colonies larger than 625 µm2 were
counted. Typically, both cell lines formed a high number
of colonies under control conditions (Figure 3E and
3F). While treatment with either ABT263 or GX15-070
alone resulted in minor reductions of colony formation,
concomitant treatment with both compounds greatly
reduced anchorage-independent growth in both cell lines
(Figure 3E and 3F). This effect was less pronounced in
U87-EGFRvIII cells that harbor the constitutively active
EGFRvIII and have a particularly resistant phenotype.

Next, we investigated whether the combination
therapy is superior in terms of inhibiting anchorageindependent growth. For this purpose, a soft agar assay
was used in which U87-EGFRvIII and LN229 cells
were treated with 1 µM ABT263, 0.5 µM GX15-070,
both agents or solvent. After 21 days of continuous

cells were treated for 24 and 48 h with increasing concentrations of GX15-070. Whole-cell extracts were examined by Western blot for

Further, we examined whether combined treatment
with GX15-070 and ABT263 also impairs tumor formation
in an in vivo setting that allows for an interaction between
the tumor and surrounding tissue, including neoplastic
features such as neo-angiogenesis. Therefore, we
implanted pretreated U87-EGFRvIII cells subcutaneously
into the flanks of SCID SHO mice and determined tumor
volumes once tumors formed. As outlined in Figure 3G,
combined treatment with ABT263 and GX15-070 did
not prevent tumor formation but resulted in a marked
reduction of tumor volumes.

(Figure 4E).
To examine whether down-regulation of Mcl-1 is
sufficient to sensitize glioma cells for ABT263-mediated
apoptosis, we performed knock-down experiments
targeting Mcl-1 in LN229 glioblastoma cells. Silencing
Mcl-1 alone resulted in a marked decrease but not a
total suppression of Bag3 (Supplementary Figure 3A).
However, knock-down of Mcl-1 combined with treatment
with ABT263 yielded a complete suppression of Bag3.
This finding was accompanied by an enhanced cleavage
of caspases 9 and 3 as well as PARP and an increase in the
fraction of sub-G1 cells (Supplementary Figure 3B and
C). Silencing of Mcl-1 alone resulted in a greater increase
of the fraction of sub-G1 cells compared to silencing of
Bag3 alone, suggesting that down-regulation of Mcl-1 is
ultimately the critical event for enhancement of responses
to ABT263, including apoptosis. Again, expression of BclxL was not markedly altered.

Treatment with GX15-070 results in downregulation of the Mcl-1-chaperone Bag3 and
subsequent loss of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2
Next, we dissected the molecular events responsible
for the GX15-070-mediated sensitization towards
ABT263. It is known that GX15-070 inhibits Mcl-1 [11].
However, the exact mechanism is not fully understood.
Bag3 has been shown to stabilize Mcl-1 [12]. In the same
study, silencing of Bag3 increased the response to ABT263
in different cancer cell lines not including gliomas. Our
data show that treatment with GX15-070 results in a dosedependent down-regulation of Bag3 in LN229 and T98G
glioblastoma cells (Figure 4A and 4B). Moreover, this
finding is accompanied by a pronounced down-regulation
of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, suggesting that GX15-070-mediated
down-regulation of Bag3 leads to loss of Mcl-1 and Bcl2 (Figure 4A and 4B). Notably, the expression of Bcl-xL
was not altered.

Treatment with GX15-070 results in downregulation of the deubiquitinase Usp9X
Usp9X modulates Mcl-1 levels and counteracts
apoptosis in cancer cells [13]. Given that GX15-070
suppresses Mcl-1, we examined whether it regulates
the expression of Usp9X. In LN229 and T98G cells,
we detected a strong reduction in Usp9X levels after 24
h and 48 h of treatment with increasing concentrations
of GX15-070 (Figure 5A-5B). In contrast, Noxa levels
revealed a slight up-regulation in T98G cells treated
with GX15-070 (Figure 5B). Next we silenced Usp9X
in LN229 glioblastoma cells to determine the impact of
Usp9X on the chaperone Bag3 as well as initiator- and
effector caspases. Silencing of Usp9X by siRNA results
in down-regulation of Usp9X protein levels, concomitant
suppression of Bag3, strong activation of caspase-9/-3
and apoptosis induction (Figure 5C-5D), suggesting
that suppression of Usp9X is a pivotal regulator of
intrinsic apoptosis and a potent sensitizer for intrinsic
apoptotic stimuli in TP53-mutated glioblastoma cells.
Consistently, LN229 cells with silenced Usp9X showed a
greater sensitivity to ABT263 as evidenced by enhanced
activation of caspase-9/-3 and a pronounced reduction in
cellular viability compared to LN229 cells transfected with
non-targeting siRNA (Figure 5E-5F). Since suppression
of Usp9X significantly enhances apoptosis induced by
ABT263, we determined the effects of ABT263 on Usp9X
and Bag3 protein levels. U251 cells were transfected with
non-targeting or Usp9X-specific siRNA and treated with
2 μM ABT263 (Figure 5G). While U251 cells transfected
with non-targeting siRNA showed an increase in both
Usp9X and Bag3 protein levels after treatment with
ABT263, this induction was attenuated in cells transfected
with Usp9X-siRNA (Figure 5G). Thus, ABT263-mediated
induction of both Usp9X and Bag3 is inhibited by

Down-regulation of Bag3 sensitizes for ABT263mediated apoptosis by decreasing Mcl-1 protein
levels in glioblastoma cells
To address the question whether down-regulation of
Bag3 by GX15-070 sensitizes glioblastoma cells towards
ABT263-mediated apoptosis, we performed knockdown experiments silencing Bag3 prior to treatment with
increasing concentrations of ABT263. Treatment with
Bag3-siRNA resulted in an efficient down-regulation
of Bag3 expression in LN229 cells (Figure 4C). In
addition, up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
protein Mcl-1, following treatment with ABT263, was
counteracted by silencing Bag3. Moreover, knock-down
of Bag3 markedly enhanced cleavage of caspases 9 and 3
upon treatment with ABT263, compared to cells subjected
to single- or combined treatment with non-targeting
siRNA and ABT263 (Figure 4D). These findings were
confirmed on the cellular level by staining with PI and
subsequent flow cytometric analysis. Silencing of Bag3
combined with ABT263-treatment significantly increased
the fraction of sub-G1 cells compared to cells treated with
non-targeting siRNA plus ABT263 or Bag3-siRNA alone

DISCUSSION

interference with Usp9X levels, suggesting that Usp9X is
upstream of Bag3 and that it is implicated in the regulation
of its expression. Next, we examined how GX15-070
regulates the expression levels of both Usp9X and Bag3.
Therefore, LN229 cells were treated with cycloheximide
in the presence or absence of GX15-070. LN229 cells
treated with the combination of cycloheximide and GX15070 showed a significantly lower expression of both
Bag3 and Usp9X, indicating that GX15-070 most likely
regulates Bag3 and Usp9X in a posttranslational manner,
potentially involving enhanced proteasomal degradation
(Figure 5I). To explore the mechanisms of enhanced
proteasomal degradation LN229 cells were treated with
MG132, ABT263/GX15-070 or the triple therapy of
ABT263/GX15-070/MG132. While the combination of
ABT263 and GX15-070 depleted both Usp9X and Bag3
levels, the triple therapy partially rescued the expression
of Usp9X and Bag3 (Figure 5J). To determine whether
GX15-070 regulates Usp9X, Bag3 or Mcl-1 expression
on the transcriptional level, we conducted real-time PCR
analyses and found that in LN229 cells Usp9X mRNA
levels were only minimally affected by GX15-070 at the
indicated time points (Figure 5H). Bag3 and Mcl-1 mRNA
levels were markedly increased by GX15-070 treatment in
LN229 cells indicating a compensatory response. Overall,
down-regulation of Usp9X, Bag3 and Mcl-1 on the protein
level does not seem to be transcriptionally mediated.

Treatment with GX15-070 enhances
antineoplastic effect of ABT263 in vivo

Evasion from apoptosis is a characteristic feature
of cancer cells and is fundamental for drug resistance,
especially in therapy refractory neoplastic diseases such
as glioblastoma [14]. Therefore, it is of great importance
to understand how apoptosis is being avoided and to
develop strategies to overcome apoptotic resistance.
Dysregulation of the Bcl‑2 family proteins, resulting in
an upward shift of the apoptotic threshold, is frequently
encountered in cancer [8]. As a consequence therapeutic
compounds (i.e. ABT737, ABT263) selectively targeting
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members were developed.
However, Mcl-1 was found to confer resistance towards
these agents [9, 10]. Therefore, a multi-targeting approach
including Mcl-1-targeted BH3-mimetics seems like a valid
strategy to overcome ABT-related drug resistance. Here,
we describe a novel drug combination for the treatment
of glioblastoma that consists of the orally available Bcl-2/
Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT263 and the Mcl-1 inhibitor GX15070. Both are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.
In phase I clinical trials, single-agent treatment with
ABT263 has been shown to have a favorable safety profile
and to be well tolerated in patients with small-cell lung
cancer or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia [1517]. Moreover, in a recently published phase II clinical
trial, combined treatment with ABT263 and rituximab
was reported to result in higher response rates when
compared to treatment with rituximab alone in patients
with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia
[18]. Similarly, GX15-070 has been studied in phase I
and phase II clinical trials for the treatment of patients
with lymphoma, small-cell lung cancer, non-small-cell
lung cancer and other solid tumors as a single-agent or
in combination with different anti-neoplastic agents [1922]. The treatment with GX15-070 was reported to be
generally well tolerated and improved efficacy was stated
by some of the studies [20, 21]. In our study, combined
treatment with ABT263 and GX15-070 yielded a
synergistic antiproliferative effect on gliobastoma cells. It
is tempting to speculate whether our combination therapy
may have a positive impact on standard of care treatments
for glioblastoma, such as radiation and/or temozolomide.
Since ABT263 and GX15-070 act at the level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members it seemed promising to
examine whether combined treatment enhances apoptosis.
Consistently, established glioblastoma cell lines, stem celllike glioma cells as well as primary cultures displayed
hallmarks of apoptotic cell death, such as enhanced
staining for annexin V, loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential and activation of initiator and effector caspases.
These findings are in accordance with the current literature
[23-27].
While our initial hypothesis was that GX15070 interferes with Mcl-1 activity, but not necessarily
modulates its expression levels, we found that GX15-070

To assess the therapeutic efficacy of this
combination therapy in vivo, U251 glioblastoma cells
were implanted subcutaneously. Once tumors formed, the
mice were randomized and treated with ABT263 (50 mg/
kg), GX15-070 (3 mg/kg), both agents or solvent. Under
these conditions, animals that received the combination
treatment had statistically significantly smaller tumors
than animals treated with vehicle, ABT263 or GX15-070
alone (Figure 6A-6C). Remarkably, animals treated with
the drug combination showed tumor regression, indicating
that the combination therapy did not only affect tumor
proliferation it also impacted tumor cell death in vivo
(Figure 6A). On histological sections we found that tumors
treated with ABT263/GX15-070 displayed a higher rate
of dead cells than the single and vehicle treated tumors
(Figure 6D). In addition, proliferation was markedly
reduced in tumors treated with the combination therapy
as reflected by a reduced staining for Ki-67 (Figure 6D).
Histological analysis showed no tissue alterations in brain,
lung, kidney, heart, liver, spleen, intestine or pancreas that
may indicate organo-toxic effects (Figure 6E).

by itself markedly reduced the expression levels of Mcl-1
in glioblastoma cells, which in turn would be expected to
attenuate ABT263-mediated up-regulation of Mcl-1 and
thus drive susceptibility of glioma cells to BH3-mimetics.
While Mcl-1 expression is known to be regulated through
posttranscriptional and posttranslational mechanisms,
there are also instances in which Mcl-1 is regulated at the
level of transcription, e.g. through activating transcription
factor 5 [28]. Therefore, we first assessed whether Mcl1 mRNA levels are significantly affected by GX15-070
treatment. Our findings suggested that in glioblastoma
cells there is a marked increase of Mcl-1 mRNA levels
in response to increasing concentrations of GX15-070.
However, this increase in mRNA did not correspond
to the observed reduction of Mcl-1 protein. Thus, we
hypothesized that GX15-070 affects Mcl-1 levels primarily
posttranslationally. Several factors are known to interact
with and stabilize Mcl-1 protein, e.g. Usp9X [13], Bag3
[12] and MULE [29]. GX15-070 did not greatly affect
mRNA levels of Usp9X and even increased Bag3 mRNA
expression however, protein levels were suppressed.
This finding reinforced the notion that GX15-070 affects
Mcl-1 protein levels through inhibition of its interacting
partners, Usp9X and Bag3. While Usp9X belongs to the
family of deubiquitinases and promotes Mcl-1 stability
by removing ubiquitin chains from Mcl-1 [13], Bag3
most likely enhances Mcl-1 levels through its function as
chaperone. However, both molecules drive Mcl-1 to high
levels within tumor cells. Akin to Mcl-1, both Usp9X and
Bag3 are expressed at higher levels in malignant tissues
[30, 31]. Bag3 protein expression is increased in both
low- and high-grade astrocytic gliomas, with the highest
expression levels found in glioblastoma [30]. Knock-down
of Bag3 caused apoptosis in a rat glioma model. Although
Festa et al. have certainly established a role for Bag3 as
a therapeutic target; they have not established Mcl-1 as
a downstream mediator of Bag3 in malignant glioma.
Moreover, GX15-070 has not been demonstrated before to
modulate the expression levels of Bag3. Thus, to the best
of our knowledge our present report is the first to highlight
a regulation of Bag3 by GX15-070. In addition, drugs that
modulate the expression or even specifically bind to Bag3
have not been described. However, given the potential
therapeutic potency as demonstrated by our knock-down
experiments of Bag3 and the fact that Bag3 is up-regulated
in malignant tissue, it may be a worthwhile approach to
unravel or design molecules targeting Bag3.
Concerning Usp9X, the present literature
suggests that while Usp9X has a pivotal role during the
development of the nervous system [32], its expression
declines in the mature brain, suggesting that it is a specific
therapeutic target for primary brain tumors. There is
minimal information on Usp9X signaling in glioblastoma
cells. Usp9X has not been targeted for clinical therapy in
malignant glioma. Given that we and others demonstrated
an apoptosis-inducing effect on glioblastoma cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

subsequent to Usp9X-silencing [33], we believe that it
is worthwhile considering Usp9X as a future therapeutic
target. Thus far, it appears that Mcl-1 is one of the major
effectors of Usp9X, but recent reports suggest that Usp9X
may have further therapeutic implications. A recent study
focused on Usp9X in the context of a frequent prostate
carcinoma-related genetic translocation (TMPRSS2ERG) [34] that facilitates tumor growth and thus not only
represents a diagnostic aid, but also a potential therapeutic
target. VCaP cells harbor the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion
and in turn they express significant levels of ERG, which
is stabilized by Usp9X. Interfering with Usp9X function
by chemical inhibition through the deubiquitinase
inhibitor, WP1130, results in proteasomal degradation
of ERG and impaired growth of tumor cells exhibiting
this genetic alteration in vivo [34]. Another compound
that reduces Usp9X levels is Pemetrexed. While Usp9X
was suppressed by Pemetrexed, the pro-apoptotic protein
Noxa was inversely regulated. Based on this model
system, Pemetrexed-mediated increase in Noxa resulted in
suppression of Usp9X and subsequent depletion of Mcl-1
protein levels, rendering lung adenocarcinoma cells more
sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. In our study, we demonstrate
a novel mechanism by which GX15-070 elicits its anticancer properties beyond the inhibitory effects on Mcl-1.
Our data show that GX15-070 was remarkably efficacious
in suppressing Usp9X protein levels in glioblastoma cells.
In the setting of the above mentioned studies it is tempting
to speculate whether GX15-070 may be useful in other
malignancies, in particular in advanced stage prostate
cancer, displaying the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.
Another recent report links Usp9X to Beclin-1, a gene
that is known as a tumor suppressor and a modulator of
autophagy [35]. Elgendy et al. demonstrated that Beclin 1
interacts with Usp9X in a region related to the binding of
Mcl-1 to Usp9X [35], linking Usp9X to both autophagy
as well as intrinsic apoptosis. Although tumor cells
harbored high levels of Mcl-1 and low levels of Beclin
1 – a relationship inversely found in normal cells – a more
detailed understanding of how Usp9X regulates both
apoptosis and autophagy is necessary.
Our results show that knock-down of both Bag3
and Usp9X leads to a depletion of Mcl-1 protein levels
in glioblastoma cells and rendered them highly sensitive
to ABT263. These findings are in line with reports from
other groups, showing that knock-down of Usp9X or
Bag3 sensitize tumor cells to ABT737. It is notable that
our study is the first to demonstrate that single knockdown of both Bag3 and Usp9X are sufficient to sensitize
glioblastoma cells to BH3-mimetics. Thus, targeting
both Bag3 and Usp9X may represent novel approaches
to overcome intrinsic and potentially extrinsic apoptotic
resistance in glioblastoma. GX15-070 is unique in that
it suppressed Bag3 and Usp9X levels simultaneously in
glioblastoma cells independently of their TP53 status,
which most likely further enhanced GX15-070 mediated

susceptibility to BH3-mimetics.
We further showed that the combination therapy of
ABT263 and GX15-070 inhibited anchorage-independent
growth of glioblastoma cells including therapy-resistant
U87-EGFRvIII cells. Moreover, we found that the
combination treatment significantly impaired in vivo
growth of U87-EGFRvIII cells. These findings are
promising as they suggest a proof-of-principle that
the combined inhibition of Mcl-1-related chaperones
in combination with selective Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitors
may be a suitable approach to combat the most resistant
phenotypes of gliomas and potentially other entities.
Finally, we tested whether this drug combination is
more effective than the single drugs alone in a heterotopic
model of murine glioma. While animals receiving either
ABT263 or GX15-070 revealed a subtle reduction in
tumor growth, the combination treatment was significantly
more active than the vehicle treated control, ABT263 or
GX15-070 suggesting that this combined strategy exerts
enhanced anti-glioma activity in vivo. These findings
are consistent with previous studies, in which other
compounds, such as mTOR/PI3K inhibitors [27] or
Inhibitor of Apoptosis protein suppressors [36], were used
to enhance the activity of BH3-mimetics in vivo. However,
the approach presented here is unique in that our proposed
combination therapy not only affects Mcl-1 itself, but
also controls the expression levels of two major Mcl-1
interacting proteins, namely Usp9X and Bag3. We propose
that compounds, affecting the Mcl-1 interacting protein
family might be a welcome addition to the treatment
repertoire for treatment resistant malignancies, such as
glioblastoma.

U87MG, LN229, U373, U251 and T98G human
glioblastoma cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, U.S.A.). NCH644
and NCH421K stem cell-like glioma cells were obtained
from Cell Line Services (CLS, Heidelberg, Germany). The
identities of the glioblastoma cell lines we purchased were
confirmed by the respective source of purchase except for
U373, which is no longer verified by the ATCC. U87EGFRvIII cells were kindly provided by Dr. Frank Furnari
(Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, La Jolla, CA,
U.S.A.). GS9-6 [28] and 2927T2 are primary neurosphere
stem-like glioma cells derived at the University of
Massachusetts (Worcester, MA, U.S.A.). The 2927T2 line
was derived from a recurrent tumor. The MGPP-3 (p53-/-,
PTEN+/+) is a murine proneural glioblastoma cell which
was kindly provided by Dr. Peter Canoll. All cells were
cultured as previously described [37].

Cell viability assays
In order to examine cellular proliferation, 3-[4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assays were performed as previously described
[37].

Measurement of apoptosis and mitochondrial
membrane potential
For annexin V APC staining the APC annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen, U.S.A.) was
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For PI
staining, cells were resuspended in 300 µl PBS and fixated
by adding 1000 µl ice-cold ethanol prior to incubation
over night at 4ºC. Then the cells were centrifuged at 1800
rpm, the supernatant was removed and 400 µl PI/RNase
staining solution (Cell signaling technology, Danvers,
MA, U.S.A.) were added prior to incubation for 15 min at
RT and flow cytometric analysis.
To detect intrinsic apoptosis staining for JC-1 was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
using the MitoProbeTM JC-1 assay kit for flow cytometry
(Molecular Probes®, Life Technologies) [38]. The data
were analysed with the FlowJo software (version 8.7.1;
Tree Star, Ashland, OR, U.S.A.).

Effects on tumorigenesis in vivo were examined
as previously described [39]. U87-EGFRvIII cells were
treated with ABT263 (2 μM), GX15-070 (2 μM), the
combination of both or solvent for 2 h prior to collection
and subcutaneous implantation of 1 x 106 cells into the
flanks of 6-8 week-old SCID SHO mice. Tumor formation
was closely monitored.

Histological analysis
Subcutaneous tumors and samples from organs
were extracted from SCID SHO mice and fixed for at
least 24 hours in 10% PBS-buffered formalin. Then
tissues were embedded in paraffin and 4 μm thick sections
were cut prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin.
Microphotographs were taken at x40 magnification.
