ABSTRACT
Purpose: Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). Based on a
confirmed partial response (PR) in an adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) patient treated
with vorinostat in a prior phase 1 trial, we initiated this phase 2 trial. Methods:
Vorinostat was administered orally 400 mg daily, 28 day cycles. The primary objective
was to evaluate response rate (RR). Exploratory studies included whole exome
sequencing (WES) of selected patients.
Results: Thirty patients were enrolled. Median age of patients was 53 years
(range 21–73). Median number of cycles was 5 (range 1-66). Lymphopenia
(n = 5), hypertension (n = 3), oral pain (n = 2), thromboembolic events (n = 2) and
fatigue (n = 2) were the only grade 3 adverse events (AEs) that occurred in more
than 1 patient. Eleven patients were dose reduced secondary to drug-related AEs. Two
patients had a partial response (PR), with response durations of 53 and 7.2 months.
One patient had a minor response with a decrease in ascites (for 19 cycles). Stable
disease was the best response in 27 patients. Targeted and WES of 8 patients in this
trial identified mutations in chromatin remodeling genes highlighting the role of the
epigenome in ACC. Conclusion: Vorinostat demonstrated efficacy in patients with ACC
supporting the inclusion of HDACi in future studies to treat ACC.

INTRODUCTION

Several anti-cancer agents have been studied
to treat metastatic ACC, however none have shown a
robust response rate, with stable disease (SD) being the
most common reported outcome. SD duration over 6
months is a common metric used in ACC trials, varying
among different agents, with reported ranges of 30–60%
(reviewed in [3]). Currently, there is no Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved agent for the treatment
of ACC.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare type of
cancer, most commonly originating from the salivary
glands, with an indolent behavior but a high propensity to
metastasize [1]. Surgery with wide resection is the mainstay
of treatment for localized ACC. A watch and wait approach
is appropriate if a patient has metastases, especially if
confined to the lungs with minimal symptoms [2].

Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), also
known as vorinostat, is a small molecule inhibitor of
histone deacetylase (HDAC). Two patients with ACC on a
previously published National Cancer Institute (NCI) trial
evaluating vorinostat in patients with advanced cancers
and liver dysfunction experienced significant radiological
and/or clinical improvement [4]. Additionally, recent
next generation sequencing (NGS) studies of ACC have
demonstrated a low mutation rate with few recurring
single gene mutations converging on regulators of
chromatin remodeling [5, 6].
Based on these encouraging findings, we undertook
this multi-institutional phase 2 trial of vorinostat in
patients with locally advanced or metastatic ACC.

(2/30 = 7% each) (Table 3). Grade 4 bronchopulmonary
hemorrhage and hypoxia occurred in 3% (1 patient each),
but neither was drug-related. Eleven patients were dose
reduced, 10 patients were reduced by one dose level to
300mg daily and 1 patient to 300 mg once a day for 5
days with 2 days off (reduction of two dose levels). Three
patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity.

Time to event end-points
Time to tumor response (TTR) was 7.7 and 10.0
months in the 2 patients who achieved PR. The duration
of their response was 53 and 7.2 months, respectively,
with the former patient still receiving study drug. Prior to
study entry, 27 (90%) of the 30 patients had documented
progressive disease on their most recent scans. The median
follow-up among the censored patients was 8.0 months for
stable disease duration (SDD), 10.0 months for progression
free survival (PFS), and 11.5 months for overall survival
(OS). The 6 month rates for SDD, PFS, and OS were
75%, 72%, and 94%, respectively. The 12 month rates for
SDD, PFS and OS were 45%, 46%, and 88%, respectively.
(Supplementary Table 1- Supplementary Appendix). The
median PFS and SDD were both 11.4 months, and the
median OS has not been reached. The estimated SDD
and PFS distributions are shown in the Supplementary
Appendix (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, respectively).

RESULTS
Baseline demographics and patient
characteristics
Thirty patients were enrolled over 22 months. As
shown in Table 1, 19 patients (63%) were female and
24 (80%) were Caucasian. The median age was 53 years
(range 21–73), 21 had a performance status of 1 and 19
were chemo-naïve. Twenty-eight had metastatic disease
and 2 patients had locally advanced disease. While not an
eligibility criterion, 27 out of 30 patients had radiographic
disease progression before study entry.

Exploratory studies

Efficacy

We hypothesized that the variation in clinical
response to vorinostat (“responders” or “non-responders”Table 4) is associated with the presence or absence of
driver mutations including those targeting chromatin
remodeling genes involved in the regulation of the cancer
epigenome. To test our hypothesis, we used both targeted
and whole exome sequencing to survey the mutational
landscape of each tumor.

Partial responses by Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) were observed in two patients.
These responses were not immediate. One patient had a
decrease in the size of lung nodules achieving a partial
response (PR) at cycle 8 and the other patient experienced
reduction in size and number of liver and lung lesions
achieving a PR by cycle 10 (Figure 1). One of the patients
with PR had surgery and radiation as prior therapies and
the other patient with PR also received surgery, radiation
and one systemic chemotherapy prior to enrolling in this
trial. While stable disease (SD) was the best response in 27
patients, 20 patients demonstrated a decrease in the size of
their tumors (Figure 2). Another patient had improvement
in ascites from cycle 6 through cycle 20 (minor response).
The overall response rate (RR) was 7% with a clinical
benefit rate (PR+SD) of 97% (Table 2). Anecdotal
improvement in symptoms was also noted in 3 patients
despite SD by RECIST. Three patients received extensive
therapy to 56, 62 and 66 cycles.

Exploratory studies results
"Responders"
We sequenced the exomes from 4 of these patients
(001–002, 001–004, 001–006, 003–014). In each case we
found somatic mutations of interest after filtering. These
and 2 additional responder cases (003–015, 004–023) were
screened with our 10 gene panel. A striking observation
was the lack of recurring gene specific mutations in these
4 cases (Table 4). However, recurring cell pathways and
processes were targeted.

There were a series of unique somatic variants
detected in this tumor. Notably these converged on
chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and
cell signaling. The DNA binding factor ARID3A has

been implicated in RB1/E2F mediated control of cell
cycle progression while KMT2E and KMT2A belong to
the myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)
class of epigenetic writers (Supplementary Figure 3Supplementary Appendix). In addition, mutations targeted
regulators of RAS (RASA3), EGFR (RHBDF1), and
estrogen (ESR1) and NOTCH (DLL1) signaling.

[15, 16]. Recurring chromosomal aberrations involving
PHF1 may be a cause of endometrial stromal tumors
[17, 18]. In addition, we detected variants in the DNA
damage checkpoint regulators ATRPhe926Leu and RAD52Y415*.
Patient 003–014
The mutations in this tumor included 3 predicted
high impact mutations in MTOR a regulator of stress
response, OGT a glycosyltransferase that modifies a broad
range of targets including H2B, AKT1, EZH2, PFKL,
KMT2E/MLL5, MAPT/TAU and HCFC1, and FAM129B a
negative regulator of apoptosis [19]. Additional mutations
included the cell cycle regulator CDC25C, the chromatin
regulators PHF2 and BRD1, and the NOTCH1 ligand
JAG1. The latter is a transcriptional target of MYB [20].

Patient 001–004
Variants in genes associated with chromatin
remodeling and DNA repair were detected. These included
BRCA1Q356R, BRCA2N372H, and EZH2D185H. However, each
of these variants appears in dbSNP, has a population
frequency of > 5%, and has not been associated with an
increased cancer risk [7]. We also detected ATMR720H in the
tumor tissue. However, the targeted amino acids in both
wild type and this somatic variant have positive charge
side chains. Thus, the functional effects of this variant
on ATM activity are not clear. In contrast the MLF1L120*
and N4BP2K76* non sense variants have low or absent
reported allele frequencies. MLF1 (Myeloid leukemia
factor 1) is a transcription factor that prevents cells from
exiting the cell cycle through suppression of CDKN1B/
p27Kip1 levels and activation of TP53 [8]. Mutations in
TP53 have been reported in ACC [6]. However, we did
not observe any TP53 mutations in the current study. Thus
the MLF1L120* mutation may provide a novel mechanism
to target TP53 mediated repair and cell cycle checkpoint
functions in ACC. N4BP2 (NEDD4 binding protein 2) has
5′-polynucleotide kinase and nicking endonuclease activity
and may play a role in DNA repair or recombination [9].

Patients 003–015 and 004–023
Both patients were screened with our 10 gene panel.
We detected a somatic variant in SMARCA2 in 003–015
adding to the list of unique mutations in chromatin
regulators. In addition, we detected a PIK3CA mutation
in 004–023. Mutations in both these genes have been
previously reported in ACC [5, 6].
"Non-responders"
We obtained WES data from one of four nonresponders (003–027). Targeted resequencing provided
additional data for a second non- responder (003–018) and
validation of the KDM6A mutation detected in the whole
exome results (Table 4).
Patient 003–027
A striking finding was the presence of a mutation in
the NOTCH1 receptor (Supplementary Figure 3). This gain
of function mutation destabilizes the heterodimerization
domain of the receptor. It results in ligand-independent
cleavage of Notch1 at site S2 and subsequent receptor
activation. This mutation is a recurrent driver of T cell
ALL [21, 22]. To our knowledge, this is the first report
of the association of this recurring mutation in ACC with
resistance to vorinostat. We also detected a nonsense
mutation in the lysine demethylase KDM6A. Mutations in
this lysine demethylase, also known as UTX, have been
reported in several cancers and are one of several classes
of mutations that are believed to converge on chromatin
remodeling in ACC [11, 23]. Pathogenic KDM6A variants
disrupt histone structure [23]. This latter mutation was
unique to non-responder 003–027 and was validated by
targeted resequencing with our 10-gene panel.
Patient 003–018

Patient 001–006
We identified two additional novel ACC mutations
(SH2D4AR237*, FZD10G345*) that have previously been
reported in colon and gastric cancer [10–13]. SH2D4A
inhibits estrogen-induced cell proliferation by competing
with phospholipase C, gamma 2 (PLCG) for binding
to ESR1, blocking the effect of estrogen on PLCG
and repressing estrogen-induced proliferation [12].
It may play a role in T-cell development and function.
Both of these unique SH2D4A and FZD10 mutations
were validated in our targeted resequencing analyses.
The Drosophila frizzled polarity gene homolog 10
(FZD10) is a member of the G protein coupled receptor
(GPCR) superfamily, exhibiting characteristics of
a WNT receptor [13]. We also detected variants in
chromatin remodeler genes including ARID4BT84R and
PHF1E128Q. The latter gene encodes a Polycomb group
protein that is a component of a histone H3 lysine-27
(H3K27)-specific methyltransferase complex, and
functions in transcriptional repression of homeotic
genes [14]. The protein is also recruited to doublestrand breaks, and reduced protein levels results in X-ray
sensitivity and increased homologous recombination

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The exome data for the tumor sample failed overall
quality metrics including coverage and percent target
bases. Targeted resequencing was of sufficient quality for
this tumor normal pair however we did not identify any
somatic variants in the 10-gene panel.

DISCUSSION

or immune therapy [37–40]. The concept of volumetric
tumor growth likely is a better method to assess response
in such instances [41]. Volumetric imaging analysis can
predict clinical response earlier than RECIST in some
cancers and it is also more sensitive than changes in
unidimensional diameters [41]. Considering the late
responses observed in some of the patients in the current
study, along with early symptomatic improvement, a
possible explanation could be that RECIST criteria may
not be the best method to monitor ACC patients for
response.
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires
evaluate the impact on patient’s functioning and wellbeing that could likely be caused by the disease and/or
its treatment without modification or interpretation by the
observer [42]. Given the slow growing but unrelenting
progression of ACC, improvement in PRO is a reasonable
measure of clinical benefit. Future trials in patients with
ACC should incorporate such questionnaires as endpoints.
Another possibility is that the late responses we
observed could be due to an immuno-stimulatory effect
of vorinostat, which may take longer to occur and not
be evident radiographically as early as with some other
therapeutic interventions. Mounting evidence suggests a
role for HDACi in modulating the immune system and
enhancing efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies.
HDACi have been shown to alter the activation and
function of macrophage and dendritic cells [43]; regulate
cytokine production [44, 45] and upregulate major
histocompatibility class I and II molecules [44, 46].
A feature of the ACC mutational landscape is a low
mutational burden with a paucity of common recurring
driver mutations typically seen in solid tumors [5, 6].
For example, TP53 mutations, one of the most frequent
somatic lesions in solid tumors, have been detected in only
5% of ACC cases studied [6]. Nevertheless, this represents
the second highest incidence of reported somatic variants
in ACC. Notably none were detected by either WES or
targeted resequencing in the present study. Recent studies
suggest that the disparate low frequency mutations in ACC
tumors appear to converge on specific pathways notably
DNA repair, chromatin regulation, and NOTCH signaling.
The exception to this inter-tumor genomic diversity is
a translocation targeting c-Myb and NFIB, creating a
fusion gene in > 40% of ACC tumors [47]. Except for low
impact variants in UTRs we did not detect any evidence
for alterations (mutations or copy number aberrant
intervals) associated with this frequent event in our ACC
cohort. However, our experimental approach, whole
exome sequences for 5 tumors and targeted resequencing
that included 3 additional samples, was designed for
problematic formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
samples and was not optimal for detection of genomic
lesions associated with translocations.
The whole exome data for the patients in this study
highlight the role of DNA repair and chromatin structure

ACC is a rare neoplasm with an initial indolent
pace. However, once it becomes metastatic, it runs an
inexorable, albeit slow growing course with poor and
short-lived responses to available treatments [2, 24].
In our study we saw 2 PRs by RECIST out of
30 patients treated with vorinostat. Both responses
occurred late into treatment after 8 and 10 cycles. A third
patient had a minor response with reduction in ascites,
and eliminated the need for therapeutic paracentesis.
Anedoctal improvement in symptoms was also observed
in an additional 3 patients (decreased pain, improvement
in shortness of breath, improvement in eye movement,
and improvement in fatigue) with SD by RECIST. Of
note, 20 patients demonstrated a decrease in the size of
their tumors. Additionally, 2 patients with ACC were
treated with vorinostat in a prior NCI liver dysfunction
trial and experienced significant clinical and radiological
improvement. (decrease in size of liver lesions and
normalization of liver enzymes from moderate liver
dysfunction) [4]. In the patients from the liver dysfunction
trial, the clinical improvement (less fatigue and pain,
weight gain) also started early (after 2–3 cycles) and
preceded any radiologic change by several cycles, similar
to what we observed in our current trial [4].
SD duration (SDD) has been described in several
trials for patients with ACC [25–31]. It is unclear if SD
represents a marker of drug activity or simply the indolent
behavior of this tumor. However, most ACC studies report
SDD of 6 months or more as an endpoint, which may be
clinically relevant, especially in view of tumors that were
progressing prior to study entry (reviewed in [32]). In our
study, although not required as part of eligibility criteria;
90% (27/30) of the patients had radiological evidence of
disease progression prior to enrollment. We observed a
6-month rate of SD of 75%, which is comparable to recent
systemic therapeutic interventions studied in this disease
[27–29, 33].
Currently, response to treatment in most solid tumors
is evaluated by measuring the sum of the longest diameter
of target lesions according to the RECIST criteria, which
has several limitations [34]. RECIST does not take into
account tumor growth dynamics or rate and cannot fully
capture response and progression in certain tumor types
such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), where
which incorporates tumor densities in assessing responses,
have been more widely used have been more widely used
[35]. Additionally, in GIST, RECIST underestimates PR
rates when compared to CHOI criteria [36]. A recent
study of sorafenib in patients with salivary gland tumors
(both ACC and non-ACC) used both RECIST and CHOI
criteria to assess responses. It revealed 6 PRs according
to RECIST, and 10 PRs according to CHOI (only 2 were
concordant with RECIST) [33]. Also, RECIST may not be
the best tool to evaluate tumor response to targeted agents

regulation in ACC. Mutations, including somatic non
sense mutations, targeting key mediators of repair,
including RAD52, ATR, and POLQ, were detected in
multiple patients. Although none of these mutations were
recurring, they converge on well-characterized steps
in DNA repair and replication. In addition, we detected
mutations targeting different cell signaling pathways
including estrogen, NOTCH and the Wnt pathway, as
well as PIK3CA/AKT signaling. In each case, unique
mutations converged on the pathway. These observations
are in agreement with recent whole exome data of ACC
[5, 6]. In addition, the validated mutation in FZD10
provides further evidence for a role of aberrant Wnt
signaling in ACC [48]. The most prominent set of
mutations was present in multiple chromatin regulating
genes (Table 4). These included lysine methyltransferases,
bromodomain containing proteins, and members of
the SWI/SNF chromatin regulator family. Variants in
SMARCA2 were detected in patient 003–015 however
they were either conserved or resulted in an amino acid
substitution with the same polarity.
The presence of the KDM6A non sense mutation
in patient 003–027 is consistent with studies suggesting
that disruption of the epigenome is a driver in a subset
of ACC [49, 50]. Mutations that arise in this region of
the protein have been described previously in multiple
tumor types. The functional impact of these KDM6A
mutations was evaluated via a well-characterized assay for
trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3).
Notably abrogation of demethylase activity was observed
in cells overexpressing mutant KDM6A but not in those
overexpressing wild-type KDM6A. Moreover, whereas
wild-type KDM6A suppressed growth, mutants either
lost the ability to suppress growth or, in some cases,
augmented it (dominant phenotype). Strikingly patient
003–027, whose tumor had a KDM6AR1272X high impact
mutation, progressed after only 3 cycles of vorinostat.
Future clinical trials should incorporate sequencing of
this and other histone demethylases as a correlative for
responses to vorinostat and other epigenetic targeting
agents. The presence of well-characterized activating
mutations in NOTCH1 supports the role of this pathway
in ACC and its potential therapeutic targeting. Notably,
mutations targeting NOTCH signaling were present in
both responders and non-responders (Supplementary
Figure 3, Table 4). Our study adds to the list of mutations
reported in ACC and provides further support for the role
of mutations targeting chromatin-remodeling genes in this
disease.
Our small exploratory study confirms the presence
of mutations targeting epigenome regulation in ACC, as 10
out of 11 patients had mutations in chromatin remodeling
genes. Notably, a well characterized mutation in the
histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX was present in a patient
who did not respond to vorinostat. This is in contrast to
the presence of mutations in histone methyltransferases
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(KMT2E and KMT2A), bromodomain containing proteins
(BRD1 and BRD3), and members of the SWI/SNF
chromatin regulator family (SMARCA2) in responders.
However, this non-responder patient (003–027) had an
activating NOTCH1 mutation, suggesting that it could be
the driving mutation in this case, as activating NOTCH1
mutations have been shown to confer a worse prognosis
[51]. The presence of a well-characterized activating
mutation in NOTCH1 confirms the role of this signaling
pathway in ACC and may provide a therapeutic window in
future studies. To advance these observations will require
a more standardized tissue collection and processing
protocol for correlative studies. Ongoing improvements
in NGS technologies will make it feasible to recover more
data from currently limited samples. In addition, the data
from our current study and recently published NGS data
provide the basis for well-designed gene panels that should
include KDM6A/UTX and related histone demethylases for
targeted resequencing
We acknowledge the limitations of our study. First,
while not all patients had documented progression of
disease at study entry, nonetheless, almost all (90%) of
the patients did. Second, we did not have a quality of life
questionnaire in this trial, which would have helped to
capture and describe the clinical improvements observed.
Third, we did not have funding to incorporate other
imaging modalities, (such as PET/CT), or to utilize other
measurement criteria (such as volumetric assessment),
which would have helped evaluate the utility of a different
imaging criteria in ACC. Fourth, due to the small number
of samples analyzed, we could not unequivocally identify
mutations that were predictors of response or resistance
to vorinostat.
In conclusion, the findings from this study are
encouraging. Vorinostat was relatively well tolerated and
patients remained on drug treatment for significant periods
of time. The clinical benefit rate (97%) was very high, as
was the 6-month stable disease rate (75%). Despite a small
number of PRs overall, these responses were durable and
associated with improvement in symptoms. We found
mutations in chromatin remodeling genes in most samples
analyzed. Perhaps the fact that ACC has a low rate of
somatic mutations, coupled with the pleotropic effects of
vorinostat as a modulator of epigenetics, can partly explain
this drug’s antitumor activity in this disease. In the future,
it will be important to assess responses to vorinostat and
other HDACi in patients with ACC relative to aberrant
epigenetic regulation with tumor gene sequencing. In
summary, despite this being a statistically negative
trial, we observed clinical improvement in symptoms in
several patients, along with two partial responses and a
significant decrease in ascites in another patient. We find
this study encouraging and will pursue further prospective
clinical trials evaluating HDAC inhibitors perhaps in
combination with other agents, for the treatment of ACC

characterize safety and tolerability of vorinostat in ACC
patients. For RD, SDD, and PFS, if progression had not

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Statistical methods

Eligibility criteria

Design

Key eligibility criteria included: histologically
or cytologically confirmed locally advanced, recurrent
or metastatic ACC; age ≥ 18 years; measurable disease
per RECIST v1.1; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status 0 to 2; life expectancy ≥
12 weeks. Any number of prior chemotherapy regimens
was allowed but not required. Laboratory parameters
included adequate organ and marrow function defined
as: leucocytes ≥ 3,000/μL, absolute neutrophil count ≥
1,500/μL, platelets ≥ 100,000/μL, total bilirubin within
institutional normal limits (WNL), liver enzymes ≤ 2.5X
upper limit of normal, and creatinine WNL, or creatinine
clearance ≥ 60 mL/min. Patients with previous brain
metastases were eligible if they were treated and stable for
≥ 1 month with no requirement for steroids. All patients
provided informed consent before treatment. The study
complied with local institutional review board guidelines.
Baseline formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE slides or
blocks needed to be available for correlative studies.

Complete + partial (CR+PR) rate was the primary
statistical endpoint. We used a 2-stage Simon optimal
design with p0 = 5%, p1 = 20%, alpha = 0.15, power =
0.90, and PET = 0.540. Stage 1 required 12 patients. At
least 1 responder in Stage 1 would be needed to justify
continuing to Stage 2, which would require 17 more
patients. If < 3 responders, we would conclude that
vorinostat has insufficient efficacy to justify further study.
Analysis
95% confidence interval (CI) estimates were
calculated via Wilson’s method. TTE endpoints were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method. Due to
the small numbers of events, point estimates of survival
statistics were estimated more conservatively using linear
interpolation among successive event times on the K-M
curves, and a slightly lower confidence level (90%) was
used when determining CI’s. A waterfall plot was used to
display the degree of response (percent change in tumor
burden).

Study design and treatment

Exploratory studies methods

This was a multicenter, international, single-arm,
phase 2 study. Patients received oral vorinostat 400 mg
once a day continuously until disease progression, death,
withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable adverse events.
Each cycle was defined as 28 days. Imaging was obtained
at baseline and repeated every 8 weeks for the first 6
cycles. After 6 months on study, imaging was extended
to every 12 weeks. Study visits occurred every 2 weeks
for the first 2 cycles, then every 4 weeks thereafter.
Safety assessments included physical examinations, AE
assessment, and laboratory measurements. AEs were
graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Vorinostat
was distributed by Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program
(CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute under a
collaborative agreement with Merck & Co. Inc.

Whole exome sequencing
The DNA from FFPE tumor tissue and from
normal lymphocytes were extracted with QIAamp®
FFPE Tissue Kit and QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit
respectively according to the supplier’s instructions. All
double strand DNAs were quantified using a QuBit®
fluorometer. In order to evaluate the clinical samples
from the patients with differential responses to vorinostat
WES of 5 available tumor normal pairs with sufficient
tumor DNA (patients 001–002, 001–004, 001–006,
003–014, 003–027) from the FFPE tissue samples was
done using Agilent_V5_PlusUTR_hs37d5_Baits. The
sequencing was done through the TGen Collaborative
Sequencing Center (for patients 001–004 and 001–006)
and the Mayo Clinic Medical Genome Facility (MGF) at
a mean depth of 60x coverage according to established
protocols [52]. Observed variants were filtered based on
a series of criteria including NextProt Feature Strength,
Maximum Population Allele Frequency, and inclusion in
the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)
database [7]. The goal was to prioritize those variants that

Objectives and endpoints
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy
as defined by response rate (RR) of vorinostat in patients
with ACC. Secondary objectives were to evaluate time to

known cancer related genes and pathways, and filter out
polymorphisms detected in patient matched normal
samples and reported in dbSNP and other population
based studies. Of significant interest were those somatic
variants that introduced non-synonymous variants within
well-annotated cancer associated genes.

Targeted resequencing
In addition to WES, we developed a 10 gene panel to
validate mutations and to screen samples with sub optimal
levels of DNA for this study. We selected 4 genes from
our initial WES results for patients 001–004 and 001–
006, and 6 additional genes from previously published
ACC data for our 10 gene panel [5, 6]. Candidate driver
aberrations targeting chromatin remodeling (SMARCA2,
KDM6A, CREBBP), DNA repair and checkpoints (TP53,
MLF1) and cell signaling (PIK3CA, SH2D4A, FZD10)
were prioritized based on their biological functions and
potential clinical utility. The final 10-gene ACC panel
consisted of SH2D4A, FZD10, TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN,
SMARCA2, KDM6A, CREBBP, MLF1, and N4BP2.
Primers were designed for each of the 10 genes with
coverage for all exons and untranslated sequencings
(UTRs) using the Ion AmpliseqTM Designer https://www.
ampliseq.com/browse.action. Our targeted resequencing
10 gene FFPE specific input panel has 87.65% coverage
with 644 amplicons ranging from 125–175 base pairs in
length, for a total of 62.09 kb of sequence. This design
provides validation of the 4 novel mutations identified in
the initial whole exome data and increases the probability
of identifying additional mutations that converge on each
of the 10 genes in the panel. For exploratory purposes,
patients were qualified as either “responders” (7/11
patients) or “non-responders” (4/11 patients) based on
whether they had a PR by RECIST (n = 2), prolonged
SD, clinical benefit to vorinostat or progressed quickly
on study. To investigate the role of somatic mutations
in responses to vorinostat we assembled archival FFPE
blocks from 2 patients and FFPE slides from an additional
9 patients treated with vorinostat. We obtained patient
matched normal blood samples as controls. In total we
screened both tumor and normal tissues from each of 8
patients (from 6 “responders” and 2 “non-responders”),
including the 5 cases that were analyzed by WES with
this panel using the Ion Torrent platform. In the remaining
3 cases there was insufficient material for either WES or
target resequencing. A full description of the methods can
be found in the Supplementary File.
