Abstract

Author Manuscript

The Ribosomal Protein (RP)-HDM2-p53 pathway has been shown to play key roles in oncogeneinduced apoptosis and senescence, but the mechanism regulating this pathway remains elusive.
The Proline-Rich Akt Substrate of 40 kDA (PRAS40) has recently been identified as a binding
partner and inhibitor of the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1). Although
other inhibitors of mTORC1 are known tumor suppressors, PRAS40 promotes cell survival and
tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate that Akt- and mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of
PRAS40 at T246 and S221, respectively, promotes nuclear-specific association of PRAS40 with
Ribosomal Protein L11 (RPL11). Importantly, silencing of PRAS40 induces upregulation of p53
in a manner dependent upon RPL11. This effect is rescued by wild type PRAS40, but not by the
RPL11 binding-null PRAS40 T246A mutant. We find that PRAS40 negatively regulates the
RPL11-HDM2-p53 nucleolar stress response pathway and suppresses induction of p53-mediated
cellular senescence. This work identifies nuclear PRAS40 as a dual-input signaling checkpoint
that links cell growth and proliferation to inhibition of cellular senescence. These findings may
help to explain the pro-tumorigenic effect of PRAS40 and identify the PRAS40-RPL11 complex
as a promising target for p53-restorative anti-cancer drug discovery.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

In order to maintain homeostasis cells must respond efficiently to environmental conditions
such as stress, growth factors, and nutrients. The tumor suppressor p53 orchestrates the
cellular response to a wide variety of stressors, including DNA damage, oncogene
expression, and disruption of ribosome biogenesis – a condition known as nucleolar
stress.1, 2 Recently it has been shown that ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11) plays a key role in
coordinating the p53 response to nucleolar stress. Specifically, when ribosome production is
disturbed, RPL11 translocates from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm where it binds and
inhibits the p53-directed E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2, resulting in increased p53 protein
stability and transcriptional activity.3–6 This enables activation of a transcription program
promoting cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis. Although the RP-HDM2-p53 pathway
has been shown to play key roles in oncogene-induced apoptosis and senescence,6, 7 the
molecular mechanisms responsible for its regulation remain largely unknown.8

In response to growth signals, the Ser/Thr protein kinase Akt phosphorylates a wide array of
substrates including Bad, TSC2, and FOXO1 to inhibit apoptosis and promote survival.9
The main intracellular pathway responsible for nutrient sensing is centered on the
mechanistic (formerly referred to as mammalian) Target of Rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR is a
Ser/Thr protein kinase that serves as the catalytic subunit of two multi-protein complexes
with distinct functions – mTOR Complexes 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2). mTORC1 is a progrowth/survival kinase that is activated only when nutrients, such as glucose and amino
acids, and growth factors are available in a cell’s microenvironment. Once activated,
mTORC1 phosphorylates p70S6K and 4EBP1 to promote cap-dependent translation and cell
growth. Growth factor-stimulated Akt promotes mTORC1 activation through two pathways.
In the first, Akt phosphorylates and inhibits the GTPase-activating protein TSC2, thereby
allowing the small GTPase Rheb to remain GTP-bound and activate mTORC1 (ref. 10). The
second depends upon the Proline-Rich Akt Substrate of 40kDa (PRAS40). When in its nonphosphorylated form, PRAS40 binds the mTORC1 component Raptor and is believed to
inhibit mTORC1 kinase activity by competing for substrate binding. In response to growth
factors, PRAS40 binds the scaffolding protein 14-3-3 in a phosphorylation-dependent
manner and dissociates from Raptor, thereby allowing mTORC1 access to its downstream
effector substrates. Interestingly, both Akt- and mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of
PRAS40 are required for 14-3-3 binding in response to growth factors.11–19 The fate or
function, if any, of mTORC1-dissociated, phospho-PRAS40 remains unknown.

Author Manuscript

PRAS40 is a major target of both Akt and mTORC1 (refs. 18–21) and, as such, is used
extensively as a biomarker for development of PI3K-Akt and mTORC1 pathway
inhibitors.22–24 Owing to its reported role as a negative regulator of mTORC1, PRAS40 may
be expected to suppress cell growth and proliferation. Indeed, other inhibitors of mTORC1,
such as LKB1 and TSC2, are bona fide tumor suppressors.25–28 However, in nearly all
studies of PRAS40 in disease models, PRAS40 upregulation has been found to promote cell
survival, tumorigenesis, or tumor progression.29–31 Therefore, we hypothesize that
phosphorylated, mTORC1-dissociated PRAS40 has its own pro-survival function,
independent of mTORC1 inhibition. To explore this possibility we interrogated the
subcellular localization and interactome of PRAS40. Our findings indicate that dual

phosphorylation of PRAS40 by Akt and mTORC1 promotes formation of a nuclear-specific
PRAS40- and RPL11-containing complex distinct from mTORC1 that inhibits the RPL11HDM2-p53 pathway and thereby suppresses induction of senescence.

Results
PRAS40 dynamically shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Although mTORC1 is thought to function mainly in the cytoplasm, it has been reported that
PRAS40 and other mTORC1 components are also found in the nucleus.32–41 To rigorously
test the subcellular localization of PRAS40, we purified nuclei from HeLa cells by
centrifuging through a sucrose cushion. The resultant nuclear fraction is void of cytosolic
and endoplasmic reticulum contamination as evidenced by lack of the marker proteins
GAPDH and calnexin, respectively. As expected, PRAS40 is abundant in the post-nuclear
fraction. Importantly, we also observe a distinct population of PRAS40 in the nuclear
fraction, albeit in lower abundance (Fig. 1A). Similarly, exogenously expressed Venus- and
Flag-tagged-PRAS40 are detected in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of U2OS and HeLa cells
via confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B–E and Fig. 2D). To test if an active nuclear shuttling
process is responsible for the nucleocytoplasmic concentration differential of PRAS40, we
treated HeLa and U2OS cells expressing Venus-PRAS40 with the nuclear export inhibitor
Leptomycin B (LMB). PRAS40 accumulates in the nuclei of cells treated with LMB, but not
vehicle control, suggesting that PRAS40 subcellular localization is controlled at least in part
by active, dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Fig. 1B–D). In all LMB experiments a
fraction of Ven-PRAS40 remains in the cytoplasm regardless of treatment time, suggesting
that only a sub-population of PRAS40 is involved in shuttling. Importantly, no difference is
observed between wild-type (WT) Venus-PRAS40 and Raptor-binding null VenusPRAS40F129A in response to LMB treatment, suggesting that PRAS40 nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling does not require interaction with mTORC1 (Fig. 1E).
PRAS40 residues 218–227 serve as a Nuclear Export Signal (NES) Sequence

Author Manuscript

We next sought to identify Nuclear Localization or Nuclear Export Signal (NLS or NES)
sequences responsible for PRAS40’s dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Deletion of the
C-terminus of PRAS40 abolishes its subcellular concentration differential and renders it
unresponsive to LMB treatment (Fig. 1F). Conversely, deletion of the N-terminus of
PRAS40 has no such effects, suggesting that sequence motifs critical to subcellular
localization lie in the C-terminus of PRAS40. Sequence analysis identifies at least two
putative NES sequences in PRAS40 – 28LVLL31 in the N-terminus and, as noted by
others,42–44 218IAASMRALVL227 in the C-terminus, but no classical NLS sequence.
Deletion of residues 218–227, but not 28–31, results in diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear
localization of PRAS40, suggesting that residues 218–227 serve as a functional NES
sequence in PRAS40 (Fig. 1G).
PRAS40 forms a nuclear-specific complex with RPL11
It is unknown what function PRAS40 may serve in the nucleus. The existence of Pro-rich
domains in its N-terminus and 14-3-3-binding phospho-sites in its C-terminus suggests that
PRAS40 may participate in various protein-protein interactions. Therefore, we probed the

PRAS40 interactome of the cytoplasm and nucleus. To achieve this, we immunoprecipitated
(IPed) N-terminally or C-terminally tagged Flag-PRAS40 from post-nuclear and nuclear
fractions of HeLa cells. The eluates were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS). Eluates from post-nuclear and nuclear fractions of untransfected
HeLa cells were used as negative controls. As expected, the known PRAS40-binding partner
14-3-3 was identified in eluates from both the cytoplasm and nucleus, supporting the
validity of our approach. Table 1 lists all the potential PRAS40-associated proteins
identified and their spectral counts averaged between N- and C-terminally tagged PRAS40
IPs in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. To identify binding partners enriched in the
nucleus we normalized spectral counts of putative binding partners (“prey”) in each
subcellular fraction to those of PRAS40 (“bait”) from the same fraction. Any putative
binding partner with a normalized nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio greater than 1 (or with zero
cytoplasmic spectral counts) was identified as a potential nuclear-enriched PRAS40 binding
partner (Fig. 2A). Of the proteins identified by this analysis, we chose to focus on
Ribosomal Protein L11 (RPL11) because its average spectral count value is similar to that of
some 14-3-3 isoforms, which are known PRAS40-binding proteins. Notably, despite their
high cellular concentrations, no RPs other than RPL11 were identified in our eluates. As
predicted from the IP-MS results, endogenous RPL11 robustly co-precipitates with N- and
C-terminally-tagged Flag-PRAS40 from nuclear, but not cytoplasmic extract (Fig. 2B). It is
important to note that PRAS40 and RPL11 are present in each subcellular fraction,
supporting the notion that the PRAS40-RPL11 association is nuclear-specific. Furthermore,
endogenous RPL11 co-precipitates with endogenous PRAS40 from nuclear, but not
cytoplasmic HeLa extract (Fig. 2C). Neither non-specific IgG nor PRAS40-specific
antibody pre-blocked with a PRAS40 peptide is capable of precipitating RPL11, supporting
the specificity of the endogenous PRAS40-L11 association (Fig. 2C). In further support of
these findings, Flag-PRAS40 co-localizes with Venus-L11 in the nucleoli of U2OS cells
(Fig. 2D).
The nuclear PRAS40- and RPL11-containing complex is distinct from mTORC1

Author Manuscript

To test whether nuclear PRAS40-RPL11 association represents a variant of mTORC1 or a
novel complex, we processed HeLa cell nuclear extract via gel filtration chromatography
using a Superose 6 column. At least two separate peaks of PRAS40 were observed,
representing different high MW complexes (Fig. 2E). The larger is approximately 2,600 kDa
and co-migrates with the mTORC1 components mTOR and Raptor, but not RPL11. The
smaller PRAS40 complex is approximately 450–700 kDa and co-migrates with RPL11, but
not mTOR. A second Raptor peak was observed around 100–200 kDa (with slight overlap of
the lower MW PRAS40 peak), most likely representing monomeric Raptor (predicted MW =
150 kDa). These results suggest that the nuclear-specific PRAS40- and RPL11-containing
complex is distinct from mTORC1 and may contain other, as-of-yet unidentified
components.
The nuclear-specific PRAS40-RPL11 association requires PRAS40 residues S221 and T246
and is phosphorylation-dependent
We next sought to identify elements of PRAS40 important for nuclear RPL11 association.

Glu/Asp-rich domain (98–109) (Fig. 3A, compare Lanes 5 and 6), suggesting the importance
of electrostatic forces, and in the C-terminus (171–256) (Fig. 3A, compare Lanes 2 and 3).
Interaction of PRAS40 with its established binding partners, Raptor and 14-3-3, is controlled
by phosphorylation within this C-terminal region (Fig. 3A).42, 43 Therefore, we
hypothesized that phosphorylation may also control the novel PRAS40- and RPL11containing complex. To test this, we generated Flag-PRAS40 plasmids harboring single,
non-phosphorylatable Ser or Thr to Ala point mutations of all the major identified PRAS40
phosphorylation sites, including mTORC1-targeted S183, S212, and S221, as well as Akttargeted T246 (refs. 12, 15, 16, 19, 45). We also generated an F129A mutation in the Tor
Signaling motif of PRAS40. This mutation is known to drastically attenuate the interaction
of PRAS40 with Raptor/mTORC1 (refs. 12, 15, 16). We assessed the effect of each of these
mutations on PRAS40-RPL11 and PRAS40-Raptor association by co-IP. Mutation of
PRAS40 F129, S183, and S212 has little or no effect on RPL11 co-precipitation. However,
mutation of the mTORC1-targeted residue S221 or the Akt-targeted residue T246 abolishes
RPL11 binding, suggesting that these residues are each necessary for PRAS40-RPL11
association (Fig. 3B). Notably, the T246A mutation disrupts RPL11 co-precipitation while
maintaining moderate interaction with Raptor, whereas the F129A mutation abolishes
Raptor binding but leaves RPL11 association intact, providing further evidence that
PRAS40-RPL11 association does not require Raptor/mTORC1 binding (Fig. 3B). Although
PRAS40 residues S221 and T246 are clearly important, this finding does not directly
implicate phosphorylation in regulation of PRAS40-RPL11 association. To address this, we
performed IPs of WT or T246A Flag-PRAS40 from HeLa nuclear extracts using buffers
either containing or lacking phosphatase inhibitors (PIs). We find that the PRAS40WTRPL11 co-precipitation, while robust in the presence of PIs, is abolished in the absence of
PIs (Fig. 3C, Lanes 2 and 5). As anticipated from our previous results, Flag-PRAS40T246A
fails to co-precipitate RPL11 regardless of PI status (Fig. 3C, Lanes 3 and 6). Importantly,
use of a phospho-specific antibody confirms that absence of PIs abolishes PRAS40
phosphorylation at T246 (Fig. 3C, compare Input Lanes 2 and 5). Notably, although
PRAS40T246A was expressed at much greater levels than WT, this mutant still fails to
precipitate RPL11, underscoring the importance of the T246 site in PRAS40-RPL11
association. Taken together, these results indicate that the nuclear PRAS40- and RPL11containing complex not only requires PRAS40 residues S221 and T246, but is also
phosphorylation-dependent.
PRAS40-RPL11 association is controlled by amino acids and serum factors through the
kinase activities of mTORC1 and Akt

Author Manuscript

Because PRAS40 residues S221 and T246 are known targets of mTORC1 (ref. 45) and
Akt,19 respectively, we wondered if these kinases and their upstream activating signals can
regulate the nuclear PRAS40- and RPL11-containing complex. PI3K-Akt signaling is
potently activated by growth factors found in serum. As demonstrated by Flag-PRAS40 coIP
from HeLa nuclear extracts, serum withdrawal reduces PRAS40-RPL11 co-precipitation to
background levels. This effect is negated by expression of constitutively active Akt (HAAktΔPH) during serum withdrawal, whereas expression of dominant negative Akt (HAAktK179M) abolishes PRAS40-RPL11 co-precipitation in the presence of serum (Fig. 4A).

nutrients such as amino acids and glucose. To manipulate mTORC1 activity without
inhibiting Akt, HeLa cells were incubated in media lacking Leu and Met but replete with
serum. Nuclear PRAS40-RPL11 co-precipitation is enhanced when amino acid-starved cells
are returned to Leu/Met-containing media (Fig. 4B, Lanes 1 and 2). This effect is robustly
inhibited by treatment with the potent and specific mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, but not
vehicle (DMSO) control (Fig. 4B). Importantly, upon rapamycin treatment (Fig. 4B, Lane 4)
mTORC1 activity is suppressed as evidenced by loss of p70S6K and PRAS40S183
phosphorylation, while Akt remains active as demonstrated by maintenance of PRAS40T246
phosphorylation. This finding suggests that inhibition of mTORC1 activity alone is
sufficient to disrupt the nuclear PRAS40- and RPL11-containing complex. Because
mTORC1 is activated downstream of Akt, experimental scenarios in which Akt is inhibited
while mTOR remains active are more limited. Indeed, we observe a decrease in mTORC1
activity (measured by PRAS40S183 phosphorylation) with expression of dominant negative
Akt (Fig. 4A). To attempt to circumvent this issue and also to test whether endogenous
PRAS40 behaves similarly to exogenous Flag-PRAS40, endogenous PRAS40 was IPed
from nuclear extract of HeLa cells expressing dominant negative Akt or mTOR with or
without constitutively active mTOR or Akt, respectively (Fig. 4C). We find that while
dominant negative Akt or mTOR alone disrupts the endogenous PRAS40-RPL11
association as expected (Fig. 4C, Lanes 3 and 5), co-expression of constitutively active
mTOR or Akt, respectively, can rescue these effects (Fig. 4C, Lanes 4 and 6). Notably, both
constitutively active Akt and mTOR were able to promote phosphorylation of Akt- and
mTORC1-activity indicator sites on PRAS40 (T246 and S183, respectively). Although
somewhat unexpected, this result is consistent with our point mutation and phosphatase
inhibitor studies that indicate a critical role for phosphorylation of Akt- and mTORC1targeted PRAS40 residues in PRAS40-RPL11 association. Taken together, these findings
indicate that formation of the nuclear PRAS40- and RPL11-containing complex is regulated
by the amino acid- and serum-stimulated kinase activities of mTORC1 and Akt.
PRAS40 depletion induces p53 protein stability in an RPL11-dependent manner

Author Manuscript

Next, we sought to determine what effect PRAS40 might have on nuclear RPL11 function.
In addition to its role in protein synthesis as a component of the ribosome, RPL11 is a key
signaling molecule in communicating aberrant ribosomal biogenesis to the cellular stress
response machinery. When ribosome assembly is disrupted (a condition referred to as
nucleolar stress),2 RPL11 translocates from nucleoli to the nucleoplasm where it binds and
inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2. This triggers protein stabilization of the tumor
suppressor p53, leading to cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis mediated by p53’s
transcriptional targets.3–6, 8, 46, 47 Because PRAS40 displays pro-survival30, 34, 35 and protumorigenic29, 31 activity through an unknown mechanism, we hypothesized that PRAS40
negatively regulates p53 through association with RPL11 and inhibition of the RPL11HDM2-p53 pathway. To explore this possibility, we depleted U2OS human osteosarcoma
cells of PRAS40 using shRNAs targeted to various regions of the PRAS40 transcript. U2OS
cells express wildtype p53 and possess a functional RPL11-HDM2-p53 pathway, but do not
express p14ARF 3–5. Interestingly, PRAS40 KD induces an increase in p53 protein levels
compared to control cells harboring non-silencing (NS) shRNA (Fig. 5A). This p53
upregulation is accompanied by an increase in protein levels of the p53 transcriptional

targets p21 and Bax. These effects are proportional to the efficiency of PRAS40 KD by two
different shRNAs, suggesting that the observed effects are directly related to PRAS40 KD
(Fig. 5A). Because p53 is a critical mediator of cell fate, it is subject to multiple layers of
regulation, including transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms. The
RPL11-HDM2 pathway acts specifically at the post-translational level by inhibiting the
ubiquitin-ligase activity of HDM2, thereby increasing p53 protein stability. Considering this,
we sought to test whether PRAS40 also controls p53 through regulation of protein stability.
We treated cells harboring either NS or PRAS40-targeted shRNAs with the translation
inhibitor cycloheximide for various times. PRAS40 KD increases p53 protein half-life
approximately 6-fold compared to the NS control (Fig. 5B). This effect, and p53 degradation
in general, is abolished by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, indicating
that PRAS40 negatively regulates p53 protein levels in a proteasome-dependent manner
(Fig. 5B).

Author Manuscript

To further explore the possibility that PRAS40 regulates p53 through inhibition of the
RPL11-HDM2 pathway, we employed Actinomycin D (ActD), a polypeptide antibiotic
known to induce nucleolar stress and upregulate p53 exclusively through the RPL11-HDM2
pathway when used at concentrations < 10 nM.6, 8, 46 While PRAS40 KD and ActD have an
additive effect at low ActD concentrations, there is no combinatorial effect at higher ActD
concentrations (Fig. 5C), suggesting that PRAS40 KD and ActD activate p53 through a
similar mechanism, namely the RPL11-HDM2 nucleolar stress response pathway.
Importantly, we also find the effect of PRAS40 KD on p53 protein level is abolished by coKD of RPL11 using two different shRNAs (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results indicate
that PRAS40 KD induces p53 protein stabilization in an RPL11-dependent manner and
imply that PRAS40 may act as an endogenous regulator of the RPL11-HDM2-p53 pathway.

PRAS40 suppresses p53 accumulation and activity in a manner dependent upon PRAS40RPL11 association

Author Manuscript

To decrease experimental variation and limit the possibilities of transfection- or selectionrelated artifacts, we generated U2OS cells stably expressing Doxycyline (Dox)-inducible NS
or PRAS40-targeted shRNAs. In agreement with our transient transfection studies, Doxinduced PRAS40 KD results in p53 and p21 upregulation compared to NS control cells
(Figs. 5E,F). Importantly, re-introduction of WT PRAS40 completely rescues this effect,
whereas RPL11 binding-null PRAS40T246A fails to do so (Fig. 5E), indicating that the
ability of PRAS40 to suppress p53 is dependent upon the capacity of PRAS40 to associate
with RPL11. Because PRAS40 is an established negative regulator of mTORC1, we sought
to test whether PRAS40 KD-induced mTORC1 activation contributes to p53 upregulation.
Although rapamycin treatment robustly blocks mTORC1 activity as indicated by loss of
p70S6K T389 phosphorylation, it has no effect on PRAS40 KD-induced upregulation of p53
(Fig. 5F). Together, these results reveal that PRAS40-mediated suppression of p53 is
dependent upon PRAS40’s ability to associate with RPL11, but independent of its ability to
inhibit mTORC1. This provides further support for the hypothesis that PRAS40 negatively
regulates p53 through inhibition of the RPL11-HDM2 pathway. To more directly test this,
we activated the RPL11-HDM2 pathway by overexpression of RPL11 as previously
reported.3–5 RPL11-inducd p53 upregulation is attenuated by co-expression of WT PRAS40,

but not RPL11 binding-null PRAS40T246A (Fig. 6G). Interestingly, PRAS40 overexpression
has no effect on p53 induced by the DNA damage-causing agent etoposide (Fig. 6F),
indicating that PRAS40’s regulatory effect on p53 is at least partially specific to the RPL11HDM2 pathway.
PRAS40 negatively regulates p53-dependent transcriptional activity and senescence

Author Manuscript

To test if the observed PRAS40 KD-induced p53 and p21 upregulation (Figs. 5A,D,E)
corresponds to increased p53 transcriptional activity we used a p53 reporter plasmid in
which luciferase transcription is driven by the consensus p53-binding promoter sequence.
PRAS40 KD significantly increases p53 transcriptional activity compared to the NS control.
Importantly, this effect is abolished by co-KD of either p53 or RPL11 (Fig. 5I). Finally, we
tested whether PRAS40 KD-induced p53 upregulation has any effect on cell survival or
growth. In order to suppress tumorigenesis, p53 transcriptional targets are known to induce
cell death, temporary cell cycle arrest, or a permanent loss of replicative potential known as
senescence. While we are not able to detect significant induction of cell death in U2OS cells,
PRAS40 depletion significantly increases senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity
compared to NS control cells. Importantly, this effect is abrogated by co-KD of p53 (Fig.
5J). Taken together, our results suggest that PRAS40 negatively regulates p53 stability and
activity by inhibiting the RPL11-HDM2 pathway in a manner dependent upon PRAS40RPL11 association, thereby helping to suppress p53-mediated induction of senescence in
unstressed cells.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Although other negative regulators of mTORC1 such as TSC1/2 and LKB1 function as
tumor suppressors, PRAS40 has a pro-tumorigenic function and is positively correlated with
proliferative disease progression.29, 31 To clarify the tumorigenic function of PRAS40 we
have interrogated its subcellular localization and interactome. Here we experimentally
demonstrate that PRAS40 subcellular distribution is controlled at least in part by Crm1dependent nuclear export directed by a NES sequence - 218IAASMRALVL227. These
results, which were obtained in the human cancer cell lines HeLa and U2OS, are consistent
with findings in A14 mouse fibroblasts published during the preparation of this
manuscript.44 Interestingly, PRAS40 contains neither a classical NLS (cNLS)48 nor a
nucleolar localization signal.49, 50 Although the MW of PRAS40 may be low enough to
allow nuclear entry via passive diffusion, gel filtration analyses indicate that PRAS40 exits
in high MW complexes in cells. Therefore, we speculate that PRAS40 may be actively
imported to the nucleus either through interaction with a cNLS-containing protein or in a
manner dependent upon a non-classical NLS.51
Using IP-MS coupled with subcellular fractionation we identify RPL11 as a nuclear-specific
PRAS40-associated protein. This is confirmed by Flag-PRAS40 and endogenous coIPs.
Furthermore, PRAS40 and RPL11 are found to co-localize in nucleoli via confocal
microscopy. The molecular mechanism for nuclear specificity remains undetermined at this
point; however, we speculate that there may exist cytoplasmic factors that inhibit, or nuclear
factors that are required for, the association of PRAS40 and RPL11. Size exclusion

chromatography reveals that the nuclear PRAS40- and RPL11-containing complex is
distinct from mTORC1, has a high molecular weight (~300–700 kDa), and therefore likely
contains other as-of-yet unidentified members. It is unlikely that PRAS40 binds mature
ribosomes because 1) the apparent size of the PRAS40-RPL11 complex is far less than that
of a ribosome, and 2) no PRAS40-RPL11 co-precipitation occurs in the cytoplasm despite
the abundance of mature ribosomes that reside therein. Therefore, it is possible that
inclusion in fully formed ribosomes may sequester RPL11 away from PRAS40 in the
cytoplasm, thus contributing to the nuclear specificity of the PRAS40-RPL11 association.

The nuclear PRAS40-RPL11 complex is phosphorylation-dependent and requires PRAS40
residues S221 and T246, known mTORC1 and Akt target sites, respectively; however, the
precise roles of phosphorylation and residues S221 and T246 remain to be clarified.
Importantly, while mutation of S221 and T246 drastically decreases PRAS40-RPL11
association, these mutations do not appear to have a significant effect on PRAS40
subcellular localization (Fig. 3B). This finding is in agreement with results published by
Wiza et al.44 Likewise, manipulation of Akt and mTORC1 activity has little effect on
PRAS40 subcellular localization (Fig. 4). Together with the fact that purified nuclear extract
was used for PRAS40 IPs in this study, these findings indicate that phosphorylation of
PRAS40 S221 and T246 does not influence PRAS40-RPL11 association through control of
subcellular localization. Although S221 and T246 are both critical to PRAS40-14-3-3
binding,19, 45 it appears unlikely that 14-3-3 is required for the PRAS40-RPL11 association.
Serendipitously, we find that a C-terminal Flag epitope tag disrupts PRAS40-14-3-3, but has
little effect on PRAS40-RPL11 co-precipitation (Fig. 2B), suggesting that PRAS40-RPL11
association does not require PRAS40-14-3-3 binding. In summary, both phosphorylation
and residues S221 and T246 are required for PRAS40-RPL11 association; however, it
remains undetermined whether S221/T246 phosphorylation is required for physical
association of PRAS40 with RPL11, only for dissociation of PRAS40 from mTORC1, or
both.
Our results indicate that the RPL11-PRAS40 complex is responsive to extracellular serum
and nutrient conditions and requires the activities of both mTORC1 and Akt. Experiments
testing the effect of dominant negative and constitutively active Akt and mTOR on
endogenous PRAS40-RPL11 association (Fig. 4C) suggest that in some cases, possibly
depending on the strength and nature of the stimulus, activation of either Akt or mTOR
alone can be sufficient to promote PRAS40-RPL11 association, likely through activation of
redundant signaling pathways that results in dual S221/T246 phosphorylation of PRAS40.

In U2OS cells with a functional RPL11-HDM2 nucleolar stress response pathway and
inactive p14ARF, PRAS40 KD leads to an RPL11-dependent increase in p53 protein level
and transcriptional activity. Consistent with a model in which Akt- and mTORC1phosphorylated PRAS40 inhibits the RPL11-HDM2 pathway, PRAS40 KD-induced p53
upregulation is achieved through decreased p53 proteasomal degradation. Together these
data imply that PRAS40 is a dual-input signal integrator and effector of mTORC1 and Akt
that suppresses the RPL11-HDM2-p53 pathway in the presence of extracellular growth
factors and nutrients (Fig. 6). Although PICT1 has been identified as a regulator of the
nucleolar stress response pathway,52 the present findings represent the first known

regulatory link between extracellular stimuli, the Akt/mTORC1 signaling axis, and the
RPL11-HDM2-p53 pathway. The precise mechanism by which PRAS40 regulates the
RPL11-HDM2 pathway remains to be determined. One possibility is that PRAS40 may
block translocation of RPL11 from nucleoli to the nucleoplasm.
Because ribosome biogenesis requires a massive influx of RPs through the nucleoplasm, it
has been suggested that cells possess an unidentified mechanism for suppressing the RPL11HDM2 pathway during this process.8 Based on the present results, PRAS40 seems to be a
potential candidate, as the mTORC1 activity that promotes ribosome biogenesis may
simultaneously induce nuclear PRAS40-RPL11 association and suppression of the RPL11HDM2 pathway.

Oncogene-induced p53 activation is a major tumor suppressive mechanism.53–55 It has been
shown that the RP-HDM2-p53 pathway is a critical mediator of oncogene-induced
senescence and apoptosis.6, 7 Because our results imply that PRAS40 is a negative regulator
of the RPL11-HDM2 pathway that suppresses p53-dependent senescence, it is plausible that
upregulation of PRAS40 is one mechanism by which cancer cells overcome the tumor
suppressive effects of oncogene-induced p53. Expression of many oncogenes including
RAS, B-RAF, E2F3, and SRSF1 can trigger p53-mediated senescence.7, 53–55 For example,
progression from benign, BRAFV600E-harboring nevi to malignant melanoma depends on
the ability of cells to overcome oncogene-induced senescence.56–58 Activation of the PI3KAkt pathway is sufficient to reverse oncogenic BRAFV600E-induced senescence and cause
progression to malignant melanoma.59 However, the exact mechanism by which PI3K-Akt
achieves this is not fully understood. Considering the reported upregulation of PRAS40 in
melanoma and Ewing sarcoma cells,29, 31 it will be interesting to determine if PRAS40 plays
a role downstream of Akt in overcoming oncogene-induced p53 activation.
In summary, while PRAS40 was previously known to serve as a binding partner and
inhibitor of mTORC1, our findings identify PRAS40 as a novel effector of Akt and
mTORC1 that negatively regulates the RPL11-HDM2-p53 nucleolar stress response
pathway to control cellular senescence. These findings suggest a mechanism for suppression
of the RPL11-HDM2 pathway during routine ribosome biogenesis in healthy cells and
provide a potential explanation for the pro-tumorigenic effects of upregulated PRAS40 (Fig.
6). As such, the PRAS40-RPL11 complex may serve as a novel target for the discovery of
p53-restorative anti-cancer therapeutics.

Figure 6. A working model for the role of PRAS40 in regulating the RPL11-HDM2-p53 pathway

In response to growth factors and nutrients, Akt and mTORC1 phosphorylate PRAS40
leading to the formation of a nuclear-specific PRAS40- and RPL11-containing complex.
PRAS40 suppresses the RPL11-HDM2-p53 pathway and inhibits the induction of cellular
senescence under growth conditions. In healthy cells, this may be one mechanism by which
mTORC1 and Akt prevent aberrant activation of the RPL11-HDM2-p53 pathway during
routine ribosome biogenesis. Cancer cells that overexpress PRAS40 may exploit this
mechanism to overcome oncogene-induced senescence.
