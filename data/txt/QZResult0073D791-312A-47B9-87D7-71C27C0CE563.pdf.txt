Abstract
Aberrant expression and/or activity of members of the Src
family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (SFK) are
commonly observed in progressive stages of human tumors. In
prostate cancer, two SFKs (Src and Lyn) have been specifically
implicated in tumor growth and progression. However, there
are no data in preclinical models demonstrating potential
efficacy of Src inhibitors against prostate cancer growth and/
or metastasis. In this study, we used the small molecule SFK/
Abl kinase inhibitor dasatinib, currently in clinical trials for
solid tumors, to examine in vitro and in vivo effects of
inhibiting SFKs in prostate tumor cells. In vitro, dasatinib
inhibits both Src and Lyn activity, resulting in decreased
cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion. In orthotopic
nude mouse models, dasatinib treatment effectively inhibits
expression of activated SFKs, resulting in inhibition of both
tumor growth and development of lymph node metastases in
both androgen-sensitive and androgen-resistant tumors. In
primary tumors, SFK inhibition leads to decreased cellular
proliferation (determined by immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen). In vitro, small interfering RNA
(siRNA)–mediated inhibition of Lyn affects cellular proliferation; siRNA inhibition of Src affects primarily cellular
migration. Therefore, we conclude that SFKs are promising
therapeutic targets for treatment of human prostate cancer
and that Src and Lyn activities affect different cellular
functions required for prostate tumor growth and progression. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3323–33]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in men in the United States (1). Whereas the 5-year relative
survival rate of local and regional stages of prostate cancer is 99.9%,
the rate drops to 34% if a distant metastasis, including those to
bone, is found at the time of diagnosis (1). Prostate cancer
metastasis to the bone is the major cause of mortality in afflicted
patients. However, due to increased screening for prostate-specific
antigen, the majority of prostate cancer patients are diagnosed
when the tumor is still confined to the prostate. Nevertheless, large
retrospective clinical studies from multiple institutions showed

that lymph node metastasis in clinically localized prostate cancer
patients is a poor prognostic factor for recurrence and disease-free
survival (2–5). In addition, extended pelvic lymph node dissection
increases progression-free survival of the patients at high risk of
lymph node involvement (6, 7). Thus, therapeutic strategies that
would inhibit growth of existing lymph node metastases or prevent
development of lymph node metastases would greatly improve
survival of patients with lymph node–positive disease.
The nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase Src and its family
members (Src family kinases, SFKs), have been shown to be upregulated in multiple types of human tumors, with Src activity
increasing proportionally to the progressive stages of the disease
(8, 9). Among the SFKs, Src itself is most frequently implicated
in human cancer, and previous studies have shown that, in mouse
models, Src activation is associated with progression and
metastasis in pancreatic (10, 11) and colorectal (12, 13) carcinomas.
In prostate cancer cells in vitro, inhibition of SFKs decreases
proliferation (14) and, more profoundly, invasion and migration
(15); the latter through selective inhibition of phosphorylation of
Src substrates, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Crkassociated substrate (p130Cas; refs. 16, 17). However, Lyn, an SFK
member, previously thought to be expressed primarily in B cells
(18), has been shown more recently to be expressed in normal
prostate epithelium and in the majority of primary human prostate
cancer specimens (19). Mice, in which Lyn is functionally deleted,
showed abnormal morphogenesis of the prostate gland (19).
Moreover, administration of a Lyn-specific peptidomimetic inhibitor significantly reduced the primary tumor volume of human
prostate cancer cells implanted s.c. into nude mice (19). Thus,
prostate cancer may be unusual in that two SFKs, Src and Lyn,
promote distinct stages of cancer progression (while the SFK Yes
is expressed in prostate epithelial cells, there is no evidence that
it plays a role in prostate development or tumorigenesis). A small
molecule SFK/Abl selective inhibitor, dasatinib (BMS-354825; refs.
14, 20), is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
chronic myelogenous leukemia and Philadelphia chromosomepositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is now in phases I and II
clinical trials for treatment of solid tumors (21, 22). Dasatinib has
been shown to effectively inhibit autophosphorylation of SFKs,
including Src, Yes, Lck, and Lyn (14, 15). In prostate cancer cells in
culture, Nam et al. showed that dasatinib affects tumorigenic
properties, inhibiting migration and invasion (15). However, studies
in preclinical models demonstrating potential efficacy of Srcselective inhibitors against prostate cancer growth and/or
metastasis had not heretofore been undertaken and which
antitumor properties might be attributed to Src and Lyn are not
known. We, therefore, examined the role of Src and Lyn individually

by silencing them in cultured cells and examining their properties
and then used dasatinib to conduct in vivo orthotopic mouse
experiments to determine the effects of inhibition of both Src and
Lyn on human prostate cancer growth and development of lymph
node metastases. Here, we provide the first demonstration that
inhibition of SFKs effectively inhibited both tumor growth and
development of lymph node metastasis of human prostate cancer
cells growing in nude mice.

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture. PC-3 and LNCaP human prostate tumor cells
were originally purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
The highly metastatic variant of PC-3 (PC-3MM2) was established by
several cycles of in vivo orthotopic implantation-metastatic selection, as
previously described (23, 24). For in vivo bioluminescence imaging, the
PC-3MM2GL cells were produced by stably transfecting a green
fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase (GL) fusion gene using vesicular
stomatitis virus G–pseudotyped retrovirus produced in 293GPG packaging
cells, as described previously (25). Briefly, PC-3MM2 cells (2  104/cm2)
were incubated with 1:1 mixture of retroviral supernatant and DMEM/
Ham’s F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for
48 h in the presence of polybrene (6 Ag/mL). The monolayer cultures
were then expanded into 15-cm dishes and GFP-expressing cells were
selected by FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Two rounds of cell
sorting enhanced the percentage of GFP-positive cells to 98%. PC3MM2GL cells were measured for luciferase activity by IVIS 200
bioluminescence imaging system (Xenogen Co.). PC-3MM2GL cells
maintained the metastatic potentials of the parental cells determined
by an in vivo orthotopic mouse model.
The androgen receptor (AR)–expressing variant of PC-3 cell line was
created as previously described (26). The FLAG epitope tag was fused at the
NH2 terminus of the human AR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 to generate
pcDNA-f:AR plasmid. PC-3 cells were transfected with 1 Ag of pcDNA3.1 and
selected with G418 (0.5 mg/mL). Expression of AR in the selected clones
was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG monoclonal and antiAR polyclonal antibodies.
Cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in DMEM/Ham’s F-12
media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 penicillin-streptomycin (Life
Technologies Invitrogen Co.) and incubated in 5% CO2:95% air at 37jC.
Cultures were free of Mycoplasma and murine viral pathogens (assayed by
Whittaker M.A. Bioproducts).
Immunoblotting. Cultured cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay-A (RIPA-A) buffer, and immunoblotting was done as previously
described (27, 28). Primary antibodies and dilutions are as follows: anti–
phospho-[Y416]-Src antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; diluted
1:1,000), anti-Src monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem; diluted 1:1,000), anti–
phospho-[Y861]-FAK antibody (Biosource Invitrogen Co.; diluted 1:1,000),
anti-FAK monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories; diluted
1:1,000), anti–phospho-[Y165]-p130 CAS antibody (Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc.; diluted 1:1,000), and anti-p130 CAS antibody (BD Transduction
Laboratories; diluted 1:1,000).
Immunoprecipitation. For detection of phospho-[Y397]-Lyn expression,
cell lysates were prepared as described above and immunoprecipitation was
done as previously described (11, 27). Briefly, protein samples (500 Ag), in a
total volume of 200 AL of RIPA-A buffer, were incubated with 2 Ag of mouse
monoclonal anti-Lyn antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) overnight at
4jC. Protein-antibody complex was precipitated with protein G agarose
beads (Upstate USA, Inc.), subsequently followed by immunoblotting with
rabbit anti–phospho-[Y416]-Src antibody (diluted 1:1,000; Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.) as described above.
In vitro proliferation assays. PC-3MM2GL and LNCaP cells were plated
at a density of 6,000 per well in 96-well plates in 100 AL of DMEM/Ham’s
F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h of incubation, 100 AL of
complete media containing 2 indicated amount of dasatinib (BMS-354825;
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) dissolved in DMSO were added to each well. At

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

24, 48, and 72 h time points, the number of viable cells was counted with
hemacytometer.
For in vitro proliferation assay of small interfering RNA (siRNA)–
expressing PC-3MM2GL cells, cells were plated at a density of 25,000 per
well in 24-well plates in 1.5 mL of selecting antibiotics-containing media.
The number of viable cells was counted with hemacytometer at 24, 48, 72,
and 96 h time points. All proliferation assays were performed in triplicate
and repeated twice.
Migration assays. Effects of dasatinib or Src-targeted siRNA on
migration of prostate cells were determined by the modified Boyden
chamber migration assay as described by Lesslie et al. (29) Briefly, parental
or Src-targeted siRNA-expressing PC-3MM2GL cells (2.0  105) were
suspended in the upper well of the 8.0-Am pore size polyethylene
terepthalate membrane culture inserts for 24-well plates (BD Biosciences)
in 500 AL DMEM/Ham’s F-12 containing 1% FBS and specified concentrations of dasatinib. The lower chamber was filled with 750 AL of DMEM/
Ham’s F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After
48 h incubation, the culture inserts were removed, and nonmigratory cells
in the upper membrane surface were scraped with a cotton swab. Cells that
had migrated to the lower membrane surface were fixed and stained with
HEMA-3 (Biochemical Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Migratory cells were counted under a microscope at 100
magnification in five random fields per inserts in triplicate.
Creation of Src-targeted or Lyn-targeted siRNA expression plasmid
and stable transfection. Src-targeted siRNA expression plasmids were
created using pSilencer1.0 U6 (Ambion, Inc.), as previously described (28).
Briefly, two c-src–specific target sequences used were 5¶-AACAAGAGCAAGCCCAAGGAT-3¶ and 5¶-AAGCTGTTCGGAGGCTTCAAC-3¶. PC3MM2GL cells, 80% confluent on 10-cm dish, were transfected with 1 Ag
of each siRNA expression plasmid and 1 Ag of pcDNA G418-resistant
promoterless plasmid for selection of transfectants, using FuGene 6
transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics Co.). Cells were then grown in
selective antibiotics media (600 Ag/mL G418-containing DMEM/Ham’s F-12
media supplemented with 10% FBS), and resistant clones were expanded.
Lyn-targeted siRNA expression vector was created in the laboratory of
Dr. Eugenie S. Kleinerman, using pSilencer2.1 U6 Hygro (Ambion, Inc.),
as previously described (30). Lyn-specific target sequence used was 5¶-AAUGGUGGAAAGCAAAGUCCC-3¶. PC-3MM2GL cells were transfected, selected, and expanded as described above, except for using DMEM/Ham’s F-12
media containing 120 Ag/mL hygromycin B as selective media. The control
vector was constructed by inserting a sequence that expresses an siRNA with
limited homology to sequences in the human and mouse genomes.
Orthotopic implantation of tumor cells. PC-3MM2GL or PC-3AR-A1
cells were detached from subconfluent cultures, and a desired number of
cells were centrifuged and resuspended with Ca2+-free and Mg2+-free HBSS
(Life Technologies Invitrogen Co.) For implantation of cells into the
prostate, the procedure of Kim et al. (31) was followed. Male athymic nude
mice (NCr-nu/nu; ages 8–12 wk; the National Cancer Institute-Frederick
Animal Production Area) were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium i.p.
(0.5 mg/1 g body weight; Nembutal, Abott Laboratories) and placed in a
supine position. A midline incision was made on the lower abdomen, and
the prostate was exteriorized. Fifty microliters of HBSS containing PC3MM2GL (5  104) or PC-3AR-A1 (1  106) cells were injected into the
dorsolateral side of the prostate. The incision was closed with surgical metal
clips (Braintree Scientific, Inc.).
Drug formulation and administration. Three days after xenograft
injection, mice were randomized to receive drug or control vehicle (six mice
per group). For p.o. administration, dasatinib (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.)
was dissolved in 80 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 3.1) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. A concentration of 15 mg/kg body weight/d
was given p.o., at 24-h intervals, using 20-gauge gavage needle. The control
group of mice was given an equal volume of diluent buffer by the same
gavage technique. Mice were treated for 28 d. For in vitro assays, dasatinib
stock solution (10 mmol/L; molecular weight, 488.0) was prepared and
further diluted in DMSO.
Necropsy and tissue preparation. At the end of 4-wk treatment, mice
were euthanized by pentobarbital sodium overdose (1 mg/1 g body weight)

SFK Inhibitor Effects on Prostate Cancer
4 h after the last drug dose or control diluent was given. Lymph node
metastasis was assessed macroscopically, and enlarged lymph nodes were
harvested for pathologic examination. Tumors were surgically excised and
weighed, followed by fixation in phosphate-buffered 10% formaldehyde.
A part of tumor tissue was embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek),
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80jC. Three medium-sized
tumors from each group were chosen for further immunohistochemical
analysis.
Immunohistochemical staining of total Src, Lyn, FAK, and autophosphorylated SFKs, and FAK-phospho-[Y861]. Paraffin-embedded
tumor tissues were sectioned 8 to 10 Am thickness and mounted on
positively charged microscope slides. Tissue slides were preheated at 60jC
for 30 min and dewaxed by immersion in xylene followed by successively
diluted solutions of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was accomplished either by
boiling the slides in pressure cooker at 125jC for 5 min, immersed in Borg
decloaker solution (Biocare Medical, Inc.) for Src, autophosphorylated SFKs
and Lyn staining or by boiling the slides in 0.1mol/L EDTA buffer for 5 min
using a microwave oven and subsequently incubating the slides for 1 h in
Dako target retrieval solution (Dako North America, Inc.) for FAK and FAKphospho-[Y861] staining, respectively. Endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked by incubating in 3% H2O2 in PBS for 12 min. After rinsing
with PBS thrice for 3 min each, nonspecific tissue binding was blocked by
1-h incubation in protein block solution (Cyto Q immunodiluent buffer;
Innovex). Primary antibody was diluted in protein block solution and
incubated overnight at 4jC. Dilution of primary antibodies are as follows:
anti-Src antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti–phospho[Y416]-Src antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-Lyn
antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-FAK antibody (1:100;
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and anti–phospho-[Y861]-FAK (1:100;
Biosource Invitrogen Co.). Slides were washed with PBS thrice for 3 min
each followed by Mach 4 Universal horseradish peroxidase polymer (Biocare
Medical, Inc.) application for 20 min as a secondary antibody. The stain was
visualized by incubation in 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with Gill’s no. 3 hematoxylin. Internal negative control samples were
exposed to protein block solution instead of the primary antibodies and
showed no specific signaling. Slides were dried and mounted with Universal
Mount solution (Research Genetics, Invitrogen Co.).
Quantification of immunohistochemical stain intensity. To quantify signal intensity of phosphorylated and total Src and FAK stainings,
5 to 10 randomly selected brightfield microscope images (magnification
100, area 0.14 mm2) per sample were captured with Sony DXC-990
three-chip charged-coupled device color video camera (Sony Co.)
mounted on Nikon Microphot-FX microscope (Nikon Co.). Images were
then processed and quantified with ImageJ, a public domain Java image
processing program (U.S. NIH6). Briefly, brown-colored images specific for
DAB stain (red = 0.26814753, green = 0.57031375, blue = 0.77642715) were
extracted by color deconvolution macro (32), inversed and measured for
intensity using ImageJ internal commands. All intensity values within the
same group were averaged to calculate ratios of phosphorylated SFKs to
total Src stain intensity and phosphorylated FAK to total FAK staining
intensity.
Immunohistochemical staining of proliferating cell nuclear antigen.
To determine the percentage of proliferating cells, paraffin-embedded
sections were stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), as
previously described (33). For quantification, three randomly selected
brightfield microscope images (magnification 40, area 0.89 mm2) per
sample were obtained as described above. The total cell number in each
image was calculated by counting hematoxylin-positive cells using ImageJ
particle count command, and DAB-positive cells were counted as PCNApositive cells in each image.
Analysis of apoptotic tumor cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase biotin uUTP nick-end labeling. To quantify numbers of the
apoptotic tumor cells, snap-frozen tumor tissue sections were analyzed with

6

a commercially available terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin uUTP
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) kit (DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL kit, Promega
Corp.), and counting was performed as detailed previously (33).
Immunohistochemical staining of CD31/PECAM and quantification
of microvessel density. To determine tumor microvessel density, snapfrozen tumor tissues were sectioned and stained for CD31/PECAM, as
previously described (33). Briefly, the slides were fixed and incubated with
anti-mouse CD31/PECAM rat antibody (BD PharMingen BD Bioscience;
1:800 diluted in protein block solution) overnight at 4jC, followed by
secondary antibody reaction with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat
antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; diluted 1:200). The
stain was visualized by incubation in DAB followed by counterstaining with
Gill’s no. 3 hematoxylin. Five randomly selected brightfield microscope
images (magnification 40; area 0.89 mm2) per sample were obtained as
described above, and positively stained microvessels were counted using
ImageJ program.
Statistics. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 12.0 for
Windows (SPSS, Inc.). The Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to compare
differences in tumor weight. Incidences of tumors and lymph node
metastases were compared between groups with Fisher’s exact test.
Migratory cell numbers in modified Boyden chamber migration assay,
microvessel density, PCNA-positive cells, and TUNEL-positive cells were
compared by Student’s t test. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results
Dasatinib treatment decreases expression of activated Src
and Lyn and the Src substrates FAK-[Y861] and p130Cas-[Y165]
in vitro. To directly determine the effect of dasatinib on Src
autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of Src substrates, time
course and dose-dependence experiments were performed. PC3MM2GL cells were treated with increasing doses of dasatinib for
1 hour (Fig. 1A, left) or with 100 nmol/L dasatinib (Fig. 1A, right)
for the times indicated. Cell lysates were prepared, and immunoblotting was performed as described in Materials and Methods.
Dasatinib inhibited expression of Src-phospho-[Y419] in a dosedependent manner, with inhibition apparent at 10 nmol/L (Fig. 1A,
left), results similar to those observed by Lombardo et al. (14).
In contrast, but as expected for a competitive ATP inhibitor,
expression of total Src was not changed. Inhibition of Src-[Y419]
phosphorylation expression by dasatinib was observed as early as
30 minutes after addition of 100 nmol/L dasatinib, and the effects
were sustained until 72 hours after treatment (Fig. 1A, right).
Phosphorylation of FAK and p130Cas were decreased as well,
but with different kinetics. Expression of FAK-phospho-[Y861] was
consistently (but transiently) increased at lower concentrations
(<150 nmol/L; 1 hour treatment; Fig. 1A, left), but subsequently
decreased at higher drug concentrations. Similar results were
observed with expression of expression of p130Cas-phospho-[Y165].
Minimal effects on expression of total FAK and p130Cas were
observed. The reason for the transient increase in FAK and
p130Cas phosphorylation is unclear, but may reflect the requirement that Src inhibition must precede inhibition of phosphorylation of its substrates.
Because PC-3MM2GL cells were genetically altered to express
both GFP and luciferase, we examined the effects of dasatinib on
phosphorylation of Src and FAK in two additional human prostate
cancer cell lines (LNCaP and the parental PC-3 from which PC3MM2GL cells were derived). As shown in Fig. 1B, cells were
treated with dasatinib (50 and 100 nmol/L) for 1 or 4 hours, and
immunoblotting was performed as described above. Inhibition of
phosphorylated FAK and Src, but not total FAK or Src, was similar
to that observed in PC-3MM2GL cells, suggesting that dasatinib

Figure 1. In vitro effects of dasatinib on Src and Src substrates. A, dose dependency (left ) and time course (right ) of dasatinib’s effects on inhibition of Src, FAK, and
p130 Cas phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting. PC-3MM2GL cells were grown to 90% confluency in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM/F-12 media,
then treated with increasing doses of dasatinib for 1 h (left), or treated with 100 nmol/L dasatinib (right ) for the times indicated. DMSO-treated or empty-treated (No Tx )
cells were used as controls (left). B, effects of dasatinib on sustained Src and FAK phosphorylation in LNCaP and PC-3 parental cells were examined by Western
blotting. Cells (90% confluent) were treated with dasatinib (50 or 100 nmol/L) for 1 or 4 h. C and D, dose dependency (C) and time course (D ) of dasatinib’s effect
on Lyn-phospho-[Y397] expression was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Lyn antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti–Src-phospho-[Y416] antibody due
to its cross-reactivity with Lyn-phospho-[Y397]. PC-3MM2GL cells (90% confluent) were treated with increasing doses of dasatinib for 1 h (C ) or treated with 100 nmol/L
dasatinib (D ) for the times indicated. Dasatinib treatment (>100 nmol/L) effectively reduced expression of Lyn-phospho-[Y397] in a dose-dependent manner (C ).
Inhibition of Lyn-phospho-[Y397] expression was apparent as early as 30 min and was sustained to 72 h after treatment (D ). Dasatinib had minimal effects on total Lyn
protein level determined by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with anti-Lyn antibody.

can effectively inhibit Src autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of key Src substrates in vitro, and expression of luciferase and
GFP did not affect SFK inhibition.
As Lyn is also expressed in prostate cancer cells and has been
shown to contribute to tumorigenic growth (19), we next tested the
effects of dasatinib on autophosphorylation of Lyn. PC-3MM2GL
cells were treated with increasing doses of dasatinib for 1 hour
(Fig. 1C) or 100 nmol/L of dasatinib for indicated times (Fig. 1D). Cell
lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-Lyn antibody.
followed by immunoblotting with anti-chicken Src-phospho-[Y416]
antibody, due to its cross-reactivity with the autophosphorylation
site (Tyr397) of Lyn. As shown in Fig. 1C, dasatinib treatment
effectively inhibited expression of Lyn-phospho-[Y397] in a dosedependent manner, although a higher concentration was required
to achieve a similar extent of inhibition to that of Src-phospho-[Y419]
inhibition as shown in Fig. 1A (left). Inhibition of Lyn-phospho-[Y397]
expression was apparent as early as the 30-minute time point and
was sustained to 72 hours after treatment (Fig. 1D).
Dasatinib treatment inhibits proliferation of human prostate cancer cells in vitro. We next determined the effects of
dasatinib on proliferation of PC-3MM2GL and LNCaP cells. For
these experiments, cells were plated in 96-well plates (6,000 per

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

well), followed by dasatinib treatment after 24 hours as described
in Materials and Methods. Viable cells were counted after 24, 48,
and 72 hours. Dasatinib treatment inhibits proliferation of both
PC3-MM2GL cells (Fig. 2A) and LNCaP cells (Fig. 2B) in a dosedependent manner, with significant inhibition occurring at
concentrations above 100 nmol/L (P < 0.01; Student’s t test),
concentrations very close to the IC50 for Lyn inhibition.
Dasatinib treatment inhibits tumor cell migration in vitro.
Previous studies have shown that dasatinib is an effective inhibitor
of prostate tumor cell migration in vitro (15). To confirm and
extend these results, migration of PC-3MM2GL cells was examined,
using a modified Boyden chamber as described in Materials and
Methods. As shown in Fig. 2C, a significant reduction of migration
was observed in cells treated with either 50 or 100 nmol/L
dasatinib (P < 0.001, Student’s t test).
Specific knockdown of src in cultured prostate tumor cells
inhibits migration, whereas lyn-specific knockdown affects
in vitro proliferation. As stated above, reduction of Src itself
rarely affects proliferation. Therefore, to determine whether Src
and Lyn affected different properties of prostate cancer cells, we
generated src-specific or lyn-specific knockdown clones of PC3MM2GL cells by stably transfecting siRNA-expressing vectors.

First, proliferation rates of clones reduced in Src and Lyn were
determined. For these experiments, cells were plated in 24-well
plates (25,000 per well), and viable cells were counted at 24, 48, 72,
and 96 hour time points. As shown in Fig. 3D, src-targeted siRNA
expression has modest effects on proliferation of PC-3MM2GL cells
(P = 0.047, Student’s t test). However, in sharp contrast, PC3MM2GL cell proliferation was extensively reduced by lyn-targeted
siRNA expression compared with parental cells (96 hour time
point, P < 0.001, Student’s t test).
Migration of Src-knockdown PC-3MM2GL cells were next
examined using a modified Boyden chamber, as described in
Materials and Methods. As shown in Fig. 3E, a significant reduction
of migration was observed in Src-knockdown cells compared with
parental cells, consistent with numerous studies that Src affects
cellular properties more associated with metastasis than cellular
proliferation (reviewed by Gallick and Summy; ref. 8). Because of
the very slow proliferating rate, migration of clones with reduced
Lyn was not determined.
Oral administration of dasatinib reduces in vivo orthotopic
tumor weight and incidence of lymph node metastases. We
next examined whether dasatinib administration affects growth of
the primary tumor and/or development of lymph node metastases in an orthotopic nude mouse model for prostate cancer. For
these studies, two variants of PC-3 cell line, PC-3MM2GL (highly
metastatic variant) and PC-3AR-A1 (transfected with a functional
AR; ref. 26), were chosen to compare the effects of dasatinib on
isogenic models with and without functional AR. Cells (1  105
for PC-3MM2GL and 1  106 cells for PC-3AR-A1) were injected
into the prostates of nude mice. Different initial inocula were
chosen as PC-3AR-A1 tumors grow more slowly than PC-3
variants not expressing AR. All mice developed primary prostate
tumors (Table 1). For studies with dasatinib, mice (n = 6 for PC3MM2GL tumors and n = 11 for PC-3AR-A1 tumors) were treated
with dasatinib 3 (PC-3MM2GL) or 5 (PC-3AR-A1) days after
injection (once daily, 15 mg/kg/d by p.o. gavage). Mice were
sacrificed after 28 days of treatment. Although, under these
experimental conditions, tumors from the untreated PC-3AR-A1
were still significantly smaller than those from untreated PC3MM2, tumors from mice receiving dasatinib were significantly
reduced in weight for both types of cells inoculated (P = 0.015 for
PC-3MM2GL and P = 0.008 for PC-3AR-A1, Mann-Whitney U test)
compared with the control diluent-treated mice. In addition,
dasatinib administration significantly reduced the incidence of
metastases to the iliac lymph nodes (P = 0.015 for PC-3MM2GL
and P < 0.001 for PC-3AR-A1, Fisher’s exact test). Lymph node
metastases were assessed by identifying solid, opaque, and
enlarged iliac lymph node, as represented in Fig. 3B. Metastatic
lymph nodes were harvested and pathologically confirmed by
H&E staining.
We repeated the same in vivo tumor experiment, but with a
different administration schedule. Orthotopic implantation was
accomplished as described above (n = 10), but one group of
animals (n = 5) received 15 mg/kg/d dasatinib divided by two doses
at 12-hour intervals by the same p.o. gavage technique for 28 days.
Figure 3A shows that dasatinib effectively reduced the median
tumor weight (2.27 g for control group versus 0.43 g for dasatinibtreated group; P = 0.028, Mann-Whitney U test). Thus, we conclude
that dasatinib significantly decreased prostate tumor growth and
lymph node metastasis in this model.

Figure 3. In vivo effects of dasatinib on growth and lymph node metastases and effects of src -specific or lyn -specific knockdown on proliferation and migration. A, cells
were implanted into the prostates of nude mice. Three days later, the treatment group received dasatinib at 15 mg/kg/d in two doses. Tumors were surgically excised
and kept on ice until photography. B, mice carrying similar size tumors were selected from each group on necropsy. The margin of the primary tumor was circled
with a black dotted line (Tu ). A solid, opaque, and enlarged tumor-positive lymph node (circled with a solid yellow line; +LN ) was observed in the control mouse,
whereas the dasatinib-treated mouse (right ) had a clear and transparent lymph node (LN ). Intestines were displaced for photography. All metastatic lymph nodes were
harvested and pathologically confirmed. C, PC-3MM2GL cells were stably transfected with siRNA-expressing vectors targeting Src or Lyn (denoted as siSrc and siLyn,
respectively). SiRNA expression vector targeting scrambled sequence was used as siRNA control (siControl ). Two clones from each transfection were selected and
expanded under selective antibiotics media. Total protein levels of Src and Lyn were determined by Western blotting. src-targeted siRNA expression clones 23 and
24 had reduced Src expression while maintaining Lyn expression level. Similarly, lyn-targeted clones 8 and 10 had reduced Lyn expression while maintaining Src
protein level. Scrambled-sequence control siRNA had no effect on Src or Lyn. D, PC-3MM2GL parental; Src or Lyn knockdown cells were seeded (2.5  105 per well in
24-well plates) in triplicate. Numbers of viable cells from triplicate wells were counted under a microscope at indicated time points with the aide of a hemacytometer.

Primary tumor size does not affect development of lymph
node metastases. Because of the ability of dasatinib to inhibit
primary tumor growth, we designed experiments to determine if
inhibition of lymph node metastases simply reflected lack of time
for tumor progression to occur or whether additional intrinsic
properties of dasatinib independently inhibited development and/
or outgrowth of lymph node metastases. As shown in Fig. 3B, there

was no evidence of lymph node metastases in a dasatinib-treated
mouse with a similar size primary tumor to that of metastatic
control tumors. To more rigorously assess whether inhibition of
lymph node metastases in dasatinib-treated group resulted from
decreased primary tumor growth, the same orthotopic prostate tumor model was established by injecting PC-3MM2GL cells
(1  105) into the prostates of nude mice (n = 18). Mice in the

control group were sacrificed after 25-day treatment of diluent
buffer only. All mice developed both primary tumors (median
weight, 1.13 g) and lymph node metastases (Table 2). In the
dasatinib-treated group (n = 6; once daily, 15 mg/kg/d by p.o.
gavage), mice were treated for 35 days (compared with 28-day
treatment in the previous experiments) to allow the primary tumor
to grow to similar size as in the control group. This strategy was
successful, as tumor weights of the extended dasatinib treatment
group were not statistically different from tumors in the control
animals (P = 0.240, Mann-Whitney U test). However, in sharp
contrast, dasatinib-treated mice were significantly reduced in the
incidence of lymph node metastases (Table 2; P = 0.015, Fisher’s
exact test). Moreover, in the untreated control group sacrificed at
only 16 days and possessing a median tumor weight of 0.32 g, lymph
node metastases developed in six of six animals (Table 2). Therefore,
dasatinib treatment seems to have independent effects on tumor
cell proliferation and development of lymph node metastases.
Dasatinib treatment decreases expression of autophosphorylated SFKs and FAK-phospho-[Y861] in tumors. To
determine whether dasatinib effectively inhibited activation of

SFKs in the primary tumors in vivo, tumor tissues were harvested,
fixed, and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis as described
in Materials and Methods. As represented in Fig. 4A, dasatinib
treatment effectively inhibited expression of SFK phosphorylation
(the anti–Src-phospho-[Y416] antibody detects autophosphorylation of both Src and Lyn; Fig. 4A, middle), whereas the treatment
had minimal effects on expression of total Src (Fig. 4A, right) or
total Lyn (Fig. 4B). Next, the downstream Src substrate FAK was
analyzed for activity in the tumor tissues. Dasatinib treatment
reduced expression of FAK-phospho-[Y861] (a Src phosphorylation
site), whereas total FAK levels were not changed significantly
(Fig. 4C). Staining intensities specific for phospho-SFKs and total
Src, respectively, were quantified as described in Materials and
Methods. Dasatinib-treated tumor tissues showed significantly
(P < 0.001, Student’s t test) reduced ratios of activated SFKs to total
Src and phospho-[Y861]-FAK to total FAK.
Dasatinib administration reduces number of proliferating
cells in tumor tissues and increases number of apoptotic
tumor cells. As shown in Fig. 2B and C, dasatinib had
antiproliferative effects on human prostate cancer cells in vitro;

thus, we determined the effects of dasatinib on tumor cell
proliferation in vivo by proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining.
As shown in Fig. 5A, dasatinib treatment significantly decreased
percentage of PCNA-positive tumor cells, compared with the
control treatment (P = 0.007, Student’s t test).
To determine whether tumor growth inhibition of dasatinib
treatment could also be attributed to inhibition of angiogenesis,
microvessel densities were measured by counting CD31/PECAM-

positive microvessels. Microvessel densities between dasatinibtreated and control groups were not significantly changed (Fig. 5C,
P = 0.58, Student’s t test). In addition, we further determined the
number of apoptotic endothelial cells by CD31/TUNEL costaining
of frozen tumor tissue samples, and there was no significant
difference between groups (data not shown). However, we could
observe a significant increase of apoptotic tumor cells in the
dasatinib-treated group (P < 0.001, Student’s t test; Fig. 5B). In

summary, our results show that dasatinib treatment of mice
bearing prostate tumors results both in decreased growth rate and
decreased metastatic potential to the lymph nodes.

Discussion
A number of genetic and epigenetic events affecting tyrosine
kinase expression occur during progression of many solid tumors.
In prostate cancer, overexpression of HER-1, HER-2, and HER-4
(34–36), c-Met (31, 37), FAK (38), and mutations in c-Kit (39) are
relatively common occurrences as prostate tumors develop and
progress. In turn, each of these protein tyrosine kinases signals
through nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases of the Src family,
resulting in deregulation of many important tumorigenic phenotypes, including proliferation, invasion, migration, epithelialmesenchymal transition (40), apoptosis, survival, angiogenesis,

www.aacrjournals.org

etc. Thus, activity of SFKs increases in progressive stages of tumors,
with highest activity in metastatic lesions, including prostate
cancer.7 Increasing evidence from molecular and pharmacologic
approaches suggests that inhibition of Src, the prototype SFK
member, inhibits tumor functions associated with metastasis,
including migration, invasion, and expression of the proangiogenic
molecules, such as interleukin-8 (28, 41) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (42, 43). In addition, recent studies indicate that
Src plays critical roles in host cells in the tumor microenvironment,
as well as in the tumor cells that contribute to metastasis (9).
Several studies have shown that Src-mediated phosphorylation of
VE-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule that is essential to the
vascular cell-to-cell junctional integrity, directly leads to increased

vascular permeability, thus facilitating intravasation and extravasation of migratory tumor cells (44, 45). For these reasons, selective
inhibitors of SFKs may be promising drugs for cancer therapy, and
a large number of clinical trials to test their efficacy are now under
way (22). However, whether SFK activity functions primarily to
promote tumor progression or metastasis or contributes to
proliferation of the tumor at the primary site remains unclear in
some tumors, especially in prostate cancer. In addition, whether
specific SFK members play overlapping or distinct roles in tumor
growth has not been studied.
Prostate cancer is unique in that, besides the expected inhibition
of Src activity affecting migration and invasion of cultured cells
(15), a second Src family member, Lyn, has been shown to
contribute to normal prostate development and tumor growth; and
inhibition of Lyn decreases growth of primary tumors (19). Thus,
inhibitors of the SFK family, such as dasatinib, might be predicted
to have greater efficacy in prostate cancer than in other tumors in
which activation of Src alone predominates.
In this study, we provide the first direct experimental evidence
that dasatinib has efficacy in a preclinical model of orthotopic
growth of human prostate cells in nude mice and does so by
inhibiting both tumor cell proliferation at the primary site, as well
as the development of lymph node metastases. In contrast,
previous studies from this laboratory have shown that, whereas
dasatinib has modest effect on growth inhibition of primary
pancreatic tumors in an orthotopic nude mouse model (11), these
effects were not due to changes in proliferation at the growing
portion of the tumor and the major effect was in inhibition of
development of lymph node and hepatic metastases. Others also
showed in vitro that Src activation does not contribute to
proliferation of colon tumor cells (46). In the current study, we
show that in prostate cancer, like many other tumors, dasatinib
inhibits development or outgrowth of metastases. This property is
especially evident as small tumors in untreated mice universally
metastasize, whereas few metastases are found associated with
much larger tumors in dasatinib-treated animals. As decreased
expression of Src in prostate tumor cells in vitro by siRNA has little
effect on proliferation, Src activation may be playing a similar role
in prostate cancer as it is in other tumors.
However, the SFK Lyn has been shown to contribute to normal
prostate development and tumor growth, and inhibition of Lyn
decreases growth of primary tumors (19). Thus, Lyn seems to affect
processes very distinct from Src. Also in contradistinction from Src,

Lyn is not expressed in endothelial cells and thus is not directly
activated by vascular endothelial growth factor. Therefore, the
striking reduction in tumor cell proliferation, as observed by PCNA
staining (Fig. 5A) and knockdown of Lyn in cultured prostate cells
in vitro is thus far unique to prostate tumor cells in preclinical
models, suggesting that Lyn affects proliferation; Src affects
migration and invasion. Alternative explanations might account
for the growth inhibitory effects of dasatinib. As no inhibitor is
perfectly specific, there may be additional targets of the drug in
prostate cancer that are not present or not critical to growth of
other tumor types. Indeed, dasatinib does show some activity
against c-Kit, which is mutated in a subset of prostate cancers (39),
and the Tec family member Bmx (47), which plays a role
downstream of Src and FAK in mediating neurotrophic-mediated
growth of human prostate cancer cells (48). We note that both Kit
and Bmx function through Src; thus, the siRNA experiments
demonstrating effects of Lyn and Src offer a compelling case that
these kinases are important targets of dasatinib.
Finally, studies with dasatinib in combination with other agents
are now reaching the clinic for metastatic prostate cancer (22). As
yet, it cannot be predicted if inhibition of Src will have effects on
preexisting metastases, but the effects shown in this study on
prostate tumor proliferation are encouraging in this regard.
Longstanding studies have shown that Src activity is critical in
osteoclast function; thus, numerous investigators have recognized
the potential for Src inhibitors in the treatment of bone metastases.
Further studies will be required to understand if additional SFKs
contribute to bone metastasis and how Src inhibitors might best be
used in treatment of this stage of the disease to which patients
succumb.
