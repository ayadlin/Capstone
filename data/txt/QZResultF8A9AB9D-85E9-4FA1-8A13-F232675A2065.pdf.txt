Abstract
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone tumor in pediatric patients.
Metastasis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. The rarity of this disease
coupled with the challenges of drug development for metastatic cancers have slowed
the delivery of improvements in long-term outcomes for these patients. In this
study, we collected 18 OS cell lines, confirmed their expression of bone markers and
complex karyotypes, and characterized their in vivo tumorgenicity and metastatic
potential. Since prior reports included conflicting descriptions of the metastatic and
in vivo phenotypes of these models, there was a need for a comparative assessment
of metastatic phenotypes using identical procedures in the hands of a single
investigative group. We expect that this single characterization will accelerate the
study of this metastatic cancer. Using these models we evaluated the expression of six
previously reported metastasis-related OS genes. Ezrin was the only gene consistently
differentially expressed in all the pairs of high/low metatstatic OS cells. We then used
a subtractive gene expression approach of the high and low human metastatic cells
to identify novel genes that may be involved in OS metastasis. PHLDA1 (pleckstrin
homology-like domain, family A) was identified as one of the genes more highly
expressed in the high metastatic compared to low metastatic cells. Knocking down
PHLDA1 with siRNA or shRNA resulted in down regulation of the activities of MAPKs
(ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs). Reducing the expression of PHLDA1 also delayed OS metastasis progression
in mouse xenograft models.

Introduction

mechanisms of OS remain unclear, although alterations
of Rb, p53, mdm2, and myc have been identified in many
cases [1, 3-6]. Pulmonary metastasis occurs early in the
natural history of OS and is a major cause of mortality

death [12]. In addition, the process of tumorigenesis is
enhanced by the down regulation of TDAG51, which
results in the inhibition of tumor cell apoptosis [13].
However, in contrast to its pro-apoptotic function,
TDAG51 has also been shown to have an important role
in insulin-like growth factor-1-induced cell survival [14].
TDAG51 can also prevent the oxidative stress induced
cell death [15]. In addition, several groups reported that
TDAG51 expression is highly enhanced in some tumor
types such as colon and intestinal tumors, indicating that
TDAG51 may be involved in tumor cell proliferation but
not in apoptotic cell death [16, 17]. In our study, using
the OS cell lines with differential metastatic potential,
we identified PHLDA1 (TDAG51) was expressed at a
higher level in the high metastatic OS cells comparing
to low metastatic OS cells. Subsequently, knock down of
TDAG51 expression using siRNA or shRNA resulted in
reduced metastasis in vivo and also reduced the activities
of MAPKs (the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases
1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). However
the mechanisms whereby TDAG51 inhibits metastasis are
unclear.

and morbidity [2]. Most patients have subclinical
micrometastasis at initial diagnosis. Survival has remained
unchanged for the past 30 years [7]. Despite complete and
definitive surgical resection of the primary lesion, nearly
90% of OS patients develop metastasis. Further, 10-20%
of patients have clinically detectable lung metastasis at
presentation and 80% of those patients will relapse. Longterm (5 years) survival rate for localized OS is less than
75%.
Limited improvement in outcomes and survival
of OS patients has been seen since the introduction of
chemotherapy in the 1970’s [8-10]. For such rare tumors,
with chaotic genetics, lack of recurrent genetic alterations,
early onset, and aggressive behavior, there is need for a
panel of preclinical models that can capture some of the
genetic heterogeneity and more importantly will allow
the study of metastasis. A variety of OS cell lines have
been described in vitro; however significant differences
in the in vivo phenotypes have been reported and often
limit the opportunity to make assessments across studies.
In this study, we, for the first time in a single research
group, evaluated the in vitro and in vivo phenotypes of
18 frequently used OS cell lines. We compared and
characterized each cell line for their tumorgenicity and
the metastatic potential in transplantable murine models.
Furthermore a priority was placed on the evaluation
of metastatic potential in these cells. Four murine OS
cell lines (K12/K7M2, DUNN/DLM8) and fouteen
human OS cell lines (TE85/HOS/HOS-MNNG/143B/
Krib, MG63/MG63.2/MG63.3, SaOS/LM7, Hu09/
Hu09-M112/Hu09-M132/Hu09-H3) with low/high
metastatic phenotypes were identified and selected for
the in vivo metastasis experiments. We validated the
identity of the selected high/low metastatic human OS
cell lines by STR (Short Tandem Repeat) DNA profiling.
The expression of bone differentiation markers in each
parental OS cell line was evaluated by RT-PCR, and the
characteristic complexity of their genomes, assessed by
karyotype analysis. Global mRNA expression analysis was
then performed using these cell lines to identify potential
metastasis related genes in OS.
From the expression subtraction of high and low
metastatic cells, PHLDA1 (also known as T-Cell DeathAssociated Gene 51 (TDAG51)) was identified as one of
the genes with higher expression in highly metastatic OS
cells. PHLDA1 was first described to have a role in the
induction of the death receptor CD95/Fas gene expression
and activation-induced-apoptotic cell death (AICD) in
response to the engagement of the T-cell receptor in a
murine T-cell hybridoma [11]. However, to date, several
reports demonstrate that TDAG51 may have both pro- and
anti-apoptotic functions depending on the cellular context
and circumstances. The reports which related to the proapoptotic function of TDAG51 support the notion that the
expression of TDAG51 is highly induced by homocysteine
and heat shock stress and it promotes apoptotic cell

Results
Collection and in vitro characterization of OS cell
lines
As shown in Table 1, we collected 18 established
OS cell lines which included 4 murine and 14 human OS
cell lines. All the cell lines were tested for mycoplasma
contamination and all were negative except MG63.2.
Therefore we developed a mycoplasma-free variant,
MG63.3 cell line, using in vivo passage, as described in
separate work by our group [18].
The origins of the OS cell lines are as shown in Table
1 with publication references. Cytogenetic karyotyping
was performed for each OS cell line which confirmed
their species of origin and complex genetic landscapes.
All the cells showed a highly degree of aneuploidy, a
characteristic hallmark of OS (data not shown). Bone
differentiation genes (osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase,
osteopontin, osteomodulin, osterix) of parental human OS
cell lines (HOS, Hu09, SaOS and MG63) were evaluated
by RT-PCR and as shown in Supplementary Table 2.
The RT-PCR results were presented as detectable or
undetectable bands. Hu09 was the only cell line expressing
all bone related genes that we evaluated. [19]. To further
confirm their origin, the mesenchymal cell marker proteinvimentin was detected by immunohistochemistry staining
and Western blot analysis for all the OS cell lines (data
not shown).

yielded orthotopic primary tumors and then spontaneous
metastasis to the lung (Supplementary Figure 1a &1b).
When testing the cell lines in the experimental metastasis
model, the median survival days of the pulmonary
metastasis of all the parental cell lines (MG63, HOS,
Hu09, SaOS, K12 and DUNN) were greater than 120
days, while the median survival days of highly metastatic
cell lines (MG63.2, MG63.3 and DLM8) were as short as
25 days (Table 1, Figure 1a & 1b).
Most OS cells metastasize to the lung, but SaOS,
143B, DUNN and DLM8 cells also metastasized to other
distant organs including lymph nodes, liver, adrenal gland,
kidney or ovary. Following in vivo characterization, the
histology of all resulting tumors was evaluated by the
veterinary pathologist and found to be consistent with
sarcoma with varying degrees of osteoid present (data
not shown). The highly metastatic OS cell lines tested
in this study were derived from their low metastatic
parental cells by chemical treatment (HOS-MNNG), or
through metastatic selection in the mouse (LM7, MG63.2,

MG63.3, K7M2, Hu09-M112, Hu09-M132, DLM8), or
single clone selection in cell culture (Hu09-H3).
Among the OS cell lines, there were 6 clonally
related groups of cell lines that differed based on
metastatic potential, (K12/K7M2, DUNN/DLM8; murine)
and (HOS/HOS-MNNG/143B/Krib, MG63/MG63.2/
MG63.3, SaOS/LM7, Hu09/Hu09-M112/Hu09-M132/
Hu09-H3; human). In each group of cell lines, the highly
metastatic line(s) is clonally related to the low metastatic
line (Figure 1b). The authentication of human cell lines
was further confirmed with STR DNA profiling by the
University of Colorado DNA Sequencing & Analyses
Core. The highly metastatic cell lines fully match their
parental cell lines (data not shown).
Following this rigorous in vitro and in vivo
characterization, we then asked if the high/low metastatic
pairs could be distinguished based on the expression of
previously reported metastasis associated genes. The
expression of previously reported metastasis associated
genes, MMP9 [20], Ezrin [21], VEGFA [22], Cadherin11
[23], S100A6 [24], and Heparanase [25] were evaluated
in these high/low OS cell lines. As shown in Figure 1c,

lines. As shown in Figure 2b, TDAG51 protein level was
also higher in the highly metastatic OS cells compared
to their poorly metastatic parental cells in 5 pairs of OS
cell lines. The differential gene expression of TDAG51
was also confirmed with RNA-seq analysis in two high/
low metastatic OS cell lines (HOS/HOS-MNNG, MG63/
MG63.3) (Figure 2c). In addition to the in vitro data, we
also observed that TDAG51 expression was increased
when the OS cells resided in the lung (PuMA day1)
(Figure 2c, Supplementary Figure 2). We then used an
existing OS patient database [26] to ask if the expression
of PHLDA1/TDAG51 correlated with the outcomes of
OS patients. As shown in Figure 2d, the OS patients with
lower expression of TDAG51 had a higher tendency to
survive longer.

were compared to their highly metastatic derivatives
(HOS-MNNG, 143B, Krib, MG63.2 and Hu09-M112)

analysis to identify commonly regulated genes that might
contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. Figure

was one of the genes with increased expression in highly
metastatic cell lines. Notably, all four probes for PHLDA1

high and low metastatic OS cells. We then expanded our

TDAG51 knock down

TDAG51 knock down compared to the control group (p =
0.0001). To confirm these results in a second model, this
in vivo experiment was repeated using HOS-MNNG/GFP
cells. Again, the lung micro-metastases were quantified
using inverted fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary
Figure 3a).
To further confirm the inhibition of metastasis
following knock down of TDAG51 expression in OS cells,
experimental metastasis experiments were performed by
tail vein injection of highly metastatic OS cells (MG63.3/
GFP) stably expressing TDAG51 shRNA or control
shRNA. As expected, mice injected with TDAG51 shRNA
expressing cells had a significantly higher survival rate
compared with control mice (p = 0.026) (Figure 4a). The
same experiment was repeated with HOS-MNNG/GFP
cells and a similar result was observed (Supplementary
Figure 3b).
To understand the mechanisms associated with

To study the relationship of TDAG51 with OS
tumor metastasis, we performed gene knock down with
TDAG51 siRNA in the highly metastatic MG63.3/
GFP and HOS-MNNG/GFP cells. The TDAG51 knock
down was evaluated by Western blot analysis using
different siRNA sequences (Figure 3a), and the reduction
of TDAG51 expression did not change the cellular
morphology, viability and proliferation rate of MG63.3/
GFP cells (data not shown). MG63.3/GFP control cells
and TDAG51 knock down cells (105 cells/mouse) were
intravenously injected into SCID mice (N = 5 per group).
Seventeen days after injection, the mice were euthanized
and the lungs were extracted and imaged with a fluorescent
dissecting microscope. The total fluorescent area in each
lung was calculated. As shown in Figures 3b & 3c, there is

the survival rates have not changed substantially in over
30 years [27, 28]. This is partly due to a lack of good
understanding of the biology of this complex cancer, its
rareness and the limited understanding of its metastasis
biology. To overcome this problem, the establishment and
use of well-characterized osteosarcoma models and the
development of novel models is essential. Tumor-derived
cell lines could be used in in vitro and in vivo models if
they are representative of the human condition and if they
allow the study of metastasis [29-31].

established in vitro, there are few reliable and reproducible
in vivo descriptions available. Since pulmonary metastasis

genetic variability of this disease, while providing the
necessary tools to comparatively study OS progression
and metastasis, which is the major cause of morbidity and
mortality in patients.
The analysis of differentially expressed genes
by microarray, comparing metastatic OS cell lines to
parental low metastatic cell lines, should help to identify
common pathways or even a set of proteins that regulate
OS tumor progression and metastasis. We and others have
previously used such approaches to identify metastasisassociated differences in gene expression, within small
subsets or pairs of high and low metastatic potential cells,
but it has not previously been possible to include a well
characterized panel of high and low metastatic cells in
this type of analysis. In this study, we identified PHLDA1
(TDAG51), one of the genes up-regulated in all the highly
metastatic OS cell lines compared to their low metastatic
parental cells. The RNA-seq study also demonstrated
the differential expression of TDAG51 between high/
low metastatic OS cells at the early stage of lung
metastasis. The survival estimation of OS patients with
high/low expression of TDAG51 showed an association
between high TDAG51 expression and poor outcome
in pediatric osteosarcoma patients. However, due to the
limited number of OS patient sample data available for
this particular analysis, the results were not statistically
significant. Recent publications showed that TDAG51
(PHLDA1) is also highly expressed in other tumor types
such as colon and intestinal tumors, which represents
epithelial stem cell features [16, 17]. In addition, it has
been reported that TDAG51 (PHLDA1) expression
is induced by external stress such as heat shock, and
modulated by IGF-I and ERK pathways [12, 14, 35, 36].
In a study of gene expression on high/low metastatic OS
cell lines, TDAG51 (PHLDA1) was reported to be upregulated in two highly metastatic OS cell lines (143B,
K7M2), but down regulated in another two high metastatic
OS cell lines (MG63-M8, SaOS/LM5) [37]. However, in
this previous study, the authors mistakenly identify TSSC3
as an alias for the PHLDA1 gene. Rather, TSSC3 is the
alias for the related PHLDA2 gene, not PHLDA1, and
therefore it is difficult to interpret these previous findings
[38].
In our gene knock down study, reducing expression
of TDAG51 in highly metastatic human OS cells
(MG63.3) resulted in a reduction of phospho-ERK1/2
and phospho-p38 and inhibition of their lung metastasis
in vivo.
It has been reported that inhibition of ERK1/2
leads to increased apoptosis and decreased metastasis in
OS studies [39, 40]. The inhibition of phospho-ERK1/2
resulted in the inhibition of OS cell motility in vivo and
slower tumor growth and prolonged survival by inducing
the production of pro-apoptotic proteins [41]. MAPK
pathway also plays a major role in the early survival of
Ezrin dependent metastatic OS cells in the lung [21]. More

model the spectrum of human metastatic OS, represents
a valuable tool in the ongoing study of this devastating
disease. In this report, we collected a large panel of
osteosarcoma cell lines. We then for the first time
rigorously evaluated their in vivo behavior employing
standardized methods and animal procedures within a
single laboratory group. All the OS cell lines we tested
produced tumors orthotopically and in 15 cases developed
pulmonary metastases. These cell lines were verified
by karyotype analysis for their respective species of
origin and identified to be highly aneuploid, as expected
in osteosarcoma. Further, the resulting tumors were
consistent with osteosarcoma with variable degrees of
bone differentiation. The tumorigenic and metastatic OS
cell lines selected in this study are believed to provide a
valuable panel of reagents to capture the heterogeneity
of this disease and to study metastases in the disease.
Accordingly, we believe that the OS models used in this
study provide potential value to pediatric osteosarcoma
researchers, and expect that our rigorous characterization
and expression analysis to fuel ongoing studies in the field.
From the 18 OS cell lines evaluated in this study, we
selected 6 groups of high and low metastatic cell lines for
the further studies on OS metastasis in vitro and in vivo.
In each group, the highly metastatic cell lines are clonally
related to their low metastatic counterparts. As previously
reported [31, 32], the 143B cell line, derived from HOS by
transfection with the k-ras oncogene, showed aggressive
progression and highly metastatic phenotype in our study.
But 143B cells metastasized to various organs including
lung, ovary, kidney, adrenal gland, and liver. HOS-MNNG
cells has been reported as non metastatic in other studies
[31, 33], but we found they consistently metastasized to
the lung in both the experimental and the spontaneous
metastasis mouse models in our studies. In this study,
we also observed relative aggressiveness of the low
metastatic parental cell lines (SaOS and Hu09) comparing
to the previous reports. All of these differences may be
accounted for by the discrete batches of cell lines, distinct
methods of injection and distinct mouse strains (Nude vs.
SCID) [34].
The clonally related high/low metastatic OS cell
lines provide excellent models to study OS metastasis.
First, the highly metastatic cell lines are all generated
from their low metastatic parental cell lines and therefore,
should have close genetic backgrounds. Second, all the
metastatic cell lines produced lung metastases within 120
days when they were injected through the tail vein and
finished the spontaneous tumor metastasis cycle in 200
days, which are the very important features for a good
model to study tumor metastasis. Third, each pair of
high/low metastatic OS cell lines have different genetic
backgrounds and were generated from tumors of different
osteoblast differentiation stages and therefore could
represent a wider range of OS patients conditions. This
may ultimately help us to better understand the extreme

intensive studies are needed to reveal the functional role of
TDAG51 in OS cell metastasis.
For the past 30 years, the studies of OS have
widened our knowledge about this aggressive malignancy.
The high genetic instability of the primary tumor, the
rareness of the disease and poor access to primary
patient material due to intensive neoadjuvant treatment
regimens hamper biological studies. Therefore, multiple
representative models are needed to gain more insight into
different processes involving OS initiation, progression
and treatment. The pairs of high/low metastatic OS cell
lines which we characterized in this study will provide
very useful models for studying the molecular mechanism
of OS metastasis and for testing or screening for novel
therapeutic agents to treat the disease.

tumor cell injection.
For experimental metastasis assays, 106 OS cells
in 100 μl HBSS were intravenously injected into the
mice. The experiments were terminated if there was no
metastasis related death at 120 days.
For both experimental and spontaneous metastasis
assays, 5 mice were used for the primary screen and
10 mice were included for the replicated experiments.
BALB/c mice were used for K7M2 and K12 OS cells,
C3H mice were used for DUNN and DLM8 and SCID
mice were used for all the human cell lines. Complete
necropsy allowed the identification and validation of
pulmonary metastases in all mice. All primary tumors
and the whole lungs with the metastases were archived by
fixing in formalin and embedding in paraffin. All animal
studies were done with the approval of the Animal Care
and Use Committee of the National Cancer Institute.

Materials and methods
Cells

Western blot

Human OS cell lines TE85, HOS. SaOS, Krib,
143B, MG63, HOS/MNNG were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Hu09,
Hu09-H3, Hu09-M132 and Hu09-M112 were obtained
from Dr. Jun Yokota (National Cancer Center Research
Institute, Tokyo, Japan). SaOS-LM7 was from Dr. Eugenie
S. Kleinerman (The University of Texas: MD Anderson
Cancer Center, Houston, TX). MG63.2 cells were from Dr.
Hue Luu (University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL).
MG63.3 cells were derived from MG63.2 by a process of
experimental metastasis [18].
Murine OS cell lines DUNN and DLM8 were from
Dr. Hideki Yoshikawa (Osaka medical center for cancer
and cardiovascular diseases, Osaka, Japan). K12 and
K7M2 were developed in our lab [18].
All the cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) medium supplement with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and glutamine except Hu09 series that are
cultured in RPMI 1460 with 10% FBS and glutamine.
Mycoplasma test were routinely performed with
Mycoalert Mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza Group Ltd,
Basel, Switzerland).

Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously [44]. Cultured cells were lysed in SDS gel
loading buffer or RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Life Science, Indianapolis, IN) and
phosphate inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL), equal amount of proteins were loaded on 4-12% or
4-20% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis,
proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and
probed with primary antibodies of Ezrin, β-Actin (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), TDAG51 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
Dallas, Texas), VEGFA (Proteintech Group, Inc., Chicago,
IL), VEGFR2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Boston,
MA), Cadherin11 (Invitrogen), Heparanase1, Vimentin
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA), S100A6 (Gift from Dr. Mark
Simpson’s lab, NCI/NIH), MMP9 (Proteintech).

DNA array and data analysis
Total RNA samples from all the OS cells were
prepared using Qiagen RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to manufacturer’s directions. RNA
quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
All samples were prepared for cRNA hybridization via
the Affymetrix One-cycle Eukaryotic Target Labeling
Assay according to manufacturer’s instructions. Once the
cRNA was cleaned and fragmented, it was individually
hybridized to Affymetrix either Mouse Genome 430
2.0 arrays or Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. All
samples were prepared and hybridized at the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) DNA array core facility.
The .CEL files were exported from Affymetrix
GCOS software and further data process and analysis

In vivo tumor formation and metastasis
After trypsinization, cells were counted and
dilutions of 2x106 viable cells in 100 μl HBSS were
injected orthotopically to the para-osseous proximal tibia
as previously described [18]. The tumors were measured
every 3-4 days. The volume of orthotopic tumor was
calculated as previously reported [42]. Tumor bearing
limbs were resected at a tumor size of 1.5-2.0 cm3. Mice
were then evaluated every other day for the development
of metastasis-associated morbidity using pulmonary

was done in R/Bioconductor software (http://www.
bioconductor.org). Briefly, data normalization was
performed with Robust Multi-array Average (RMA)
procedure; differentially expressed analysis was done by
the affy and simpleaffy packages. Adjustment of P-values
was done by Benjamini and Hochberg method [45].
The top differentially expressed genes were selected by
adjusted P-values and log fold change. The dendrogram
was generated with distance calculated by Euclidean
method and hierarchical clustering was done using method
of “average”.

siRNA or a pool of 4 siRNAs (Qiagen). The knock down
efficiency was evaluated by western blotting.
For the knock down of TDAG51 with shRNA,
MG63.3/GFP or HOS-MNNG/GFP cells were seeded
in the 6-well plate (105 cells/well) one day before
transfection. The cells were infected with lentiviral
suspensions (106TU/well or MOT=5) containing nontarget control vector or containing pLKO.1-shTDAG51
(Sigma). The stably transfected cells were selected and
maintained with puromycin. The knock down efficiency
was evaluated by Western blot analysis.

RNA Sequencing and Data Analysis

Early pulmonary metastasis assessment

Gene expression profiles of cell lines grown in vitro
were compared to expression profiles of the same cell lines
at early time points during metastatic colonization using
the ex vivo pulmonary metastasis assay (PuMA) [46].
Briefly, 1x106 GFP+ cells (HOS/HOS-MNNG, MG63/
MG63.3) were injected into the tail veins of SCID mice.
The mice were immediately sacrificed and their lungs were
insufflated with a media/agarose mixture, transversely
sectioned, and grown in ex vivo culture on gel foam at
the media air/fluid interface. Twenty-four hours after
injection, the lungs were mechanically homogenized and
GFP+ tumor cells were separated from mouse lung cells
by FACS. RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen)
and purified using the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen). In Vitro
cultured cells were trypsinized, subjected to mechanical
homogenization and the same downstream processing as
cells isolated from PuMA. RNA quality was assessed using
an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. PolyA+ RNA was prepared
for sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample
Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq
2000 platform at the Case Western Reserve University
Next Generation Sequencing Core Facility.
For gene expression analysis, reads were aligned
to the hg19 genome build (retrieved from http://cufflinks.
cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html), using Tophat v2.0.7 [47].
FPKM values for known genes were calculated using
Cufflinks v2.0.2 [48] provided with the GTF file via the
-G (known genes only) option. FPKM values were tabled
by converting background values (<0.3) to 0 and adding
0.3 to all values [49]. FPKMs were quantile normalized
across all samples.

MG63.3/GFP cells were transfected with control
siRNA and TDAG51 siRNA for 24 hours, then harvested
and intravenously injected (105 cells in 100 μl HBSS)
into SCID mice. The mice were sacrificed at 17 days
after injection. The lungs were extracted and imaged
using Leica MZFLIII dissecting fluorescent microscope.
The total areas of GFP fluorescence were calculated with
Openlab software (Improvision Ltd., Coventry, England).
This experiment was also repeated in HOS/MNNG/
GFP cells. 5X105 cells were injected into female SCID
mice. The green fluorescent micro lung metastases were
counted using a Leica DMIRB inverted fluorescent
microscope.

Human Phospho-kinase array
TDAG51 siRNA and scrambled siRNA were
transfected into MG63.3 cells. Forty-eight hours later,
cell lysates were collected from 107 TDAG51 knock
down cells and control cells. Total protein of 200 μg
was used for the immunoblotting with human phosphokinase array. The experiment was performed following the
manufacture’s instruction (B&D systems, Minneapolis,
MN). Image J was used to quantify the intensity of the
Western blot signals.
