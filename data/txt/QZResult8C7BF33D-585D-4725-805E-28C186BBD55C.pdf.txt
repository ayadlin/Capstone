ABSTRACT
Dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, has antitumor properties in various carcinoma models. Diisopropylamine dichloroacetate
(DADA), an over-the-counter drug for chronic liver disease, is a derivative of DCA. To
date, few studies have evaluated the anticancer potential of DADA in breast cancer.
In this study, MDA-MB-231 cells, a breast adenocarcinoma cell line, were used in in
vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of DADA and DCA.
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DADA (7.1 ± 1.1 mmol/L) against
MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly lower than that of DCA (15.6 ± 2.0 mmol/L); 100
mg/kg (0.0004 mol/kg) DADA was better than 100 mg/kg (0.0008 mol/kg) DCA at
suppressing the growth of subcutaneous transplantation breast tumor at the same
dose after 24 days intervention. Histological examination showed that both DCA and
DADA interventions led to necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis of tumor tissue in a
mouse subcutaneous transplantation breast tumor model. DADA treatment inhibited
Ki67 expression in tumor tissue. In vitro experiments showed that DADA could inhibit
lactic acid production and glucose uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells at 10 mmol/L and
these effects were stronger than DCA. DADA administration also induced complete
autophagy during early treatment stages and incomplete autophagy and cell death at
later treatment stages. In conclusion, DADA showed better anti-tumor efficacy than
DCA in a breast cancer model.

various factors, including the cancer classification, cancer
stage, and patient age [5]. Although multidisciplinary
approaches, including hormone-blocking therapy for
hormone-receptor-positive cancers and monoclonal
antibodies to treat certain cases of metastatic cancer, have
improved the survival rate in the developed world, breast
cancer remains a major challenge for women’s health
worldwide, especially in developing countries [3].
Like all other cancers, breast cancer occurs when
breast cells uncontrollably divide and evade cell death
[6]. Breast cancer occurrence is generally determined by

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer develops from breast cells [1]. The
most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma,
which begins in the cells of the ducts [2]. Breast cancer
can also begin in lobule cells or in other breast tissues
[2]. Breast cancer in women is a major public health
problem in both developed and developing countries; over
508,000 women died from it in 2011 [3]. Breast cancer is
typically treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, or both [2, 4]. The outcome depends on

the interaction between environmental (external) factors
and genetic susceptibility [7]. An example of genetic
susceptibility to breast cancer includes mutations in the
breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) or BRCA2 gene, which results in
a lifetime risk of breast cancer of between 60% and 85%
[8]. However, only 5 to 10% of cases are due to inherited
genes [9]. Many other risk factors, including age, obesity,
smoking, lack of physical exercise, alcohol consumption,
hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing
radiation, early age at first menstruation, and having
children late or not at all, were found to increase the risk
of breast cancer [10, 11]. In general, our knowledge on
the pathophysiology of breast cancer is lacking. Therefore,
extensive research is needed to improve breast cancer
management.
A low level of glycolysis and oxidation of
pyruvate occurs in the mitochondria of most normal cells
[12]. This process is aerobic, and is termed oxidative
phosphorylation [12]. In contrast to normal cells, most
cancer cells predominantly produce energy by increasing
the rate of glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation in the
cytosol to support rapid cell division and growth [13]. The
glycolytic rates of rapidly growing malignant tumor cells
can be 200 times higher than that in normal cells [14].
This reprogramming of energy metabolism in cancer cells
is collectively known as the Warburg effect, and is a valid
therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment [13, 14].
Another cell mechanism altered in cancer cells is
autophagy, which is a natural destructive mechanism
that disassembles unnecessary or dysfunctional
cellular components [15]. During autophagy, targeted
cytoplasmic constituents are isolated within a doublemembraned vesicle known as an autophagosome [16].
The autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome, and the
contents are degraded and recycled through a regulated
process [15-19]. Two proteins involved in autophagy,
cytosolic microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3
(LC3) and sequestosome 1 (p62), are highly conserved
and play important roles in key stages of autophagy [1519]. In the LC3 processing pathway, LC3-I is conjugated
to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to become LC3-II via
activating enzyme autophagy-related (Atg)7 genes and
the conjugating enzyme Atg3 [15-19]. p62 can deliver
selective autophagic cargo for degradation by binding
directly to LC3 and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
receptor-associated proteins [15-19]. The p62 protein
is itself degraded by autophagy; p62 accumulates when
autophagy is inhibited, while p62 quantities decrease when
autophagy is induced [20].
The role of autophagy in cancer has been well
researched [15-20], yet two opposing views exist.
Autophagy can contribute to cancer by promoting survival
of tumor cells that have been starved due to excessive
energy demand or through the degradation of apoptotic
mediators [21]. In these cases, autophagy inhibitors, such
as chloroquine, could complement antineoplastic drugs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[22]. However, recent research suggests that autophagy
could suppress tumor growth by reducing necrosis and
chronic inflammation [23]. In addition, a single allele
deletion of Beclin-1, an Atg, is common in human breast,
ovarian, and prostate cancers, suggesting that autophagy
may have tumor suppressor properties [24].
The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a major link
among carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism
[25]. Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase inhibitor, which can preferentially divert
glucose metabolism from glycolysis towards oxidative
phosphorylation through the activation of pyruvate
dehydrogenase [26, 27]. DCA has been shown to have
anti-tumor properties in various carcinoma models, and
its clinical application is currently being investigated
in trials [26, 27]. A DCA homolog, diisopropylamine
dichloroacetate (DADA), also known as vitamin B15,
improves energy metabolism in hepatocytes and has
been used for decades to treat chronic liver disease [26,
27]. Recent studies have shown that DADA has potential
therapeutic effects on colorectal cancer [26, 27]. However,
existing research has not fully determined the anti-tumor
mechanisms of DADA or DCA. In addition, to date, few
studies have evaluated the anticancer potential of DADA
in breast cancer. In this report, the effect of DADA and
DCA on lactic acid production and glucose uptake,
autophagy, tumor growth, and the expression of nuclear
antigen Ki67 were examined in a breast adenocarcinoma
cell line and in subcutaneous transplantation breast tumors.

RESULTS
DADA inhibits proliferation in MDA-MB-231
cells
Our preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments
showed that DADA had a broad spectrum of anti-tumor
capabilities. To systematically study the anti-tumor
effect of DADA, MDA-MB-231 cells were used in the
following in vitro and in vivo experiments. First, the in
vitro anti-tumor capabilities of DADA and DCA were
evaluated using the IC50 method. Serially diluted DADA
and DCA solutions were added to MDA-MB-231 cells
and incubated for 48 h. Cell viability was examined
using MTT assays. As shown in Figure 1A, cell viability
decreased in a concentration-dependent manner when
treated with DADA and DCA. The IC50 of DADA was 7.1
± 1.1 mmol/L, which was significantly lower than the IC50
of DCA (15.6 ± 2.0 mmol/L) (P < 0.05).

cells. Once the subcutaneously transplanted tumors had
grown to 100–150 mm3, the mice were divided into 3
groups (5 in each group): control, DADA, and DCA
(Figure 2A). The mouse groups were lavaged once a
day with 100 μL 0.9% saline (control group), 100 mg/kg
(0.0004 mol/kg) DADA (DADA-treated group), or 100
mg/kg (0.0008 mol/kg) DCA (DCA-treated group) for 24
d. Tumor volume was measured every 3 d. As shown in
Figure 2B, the tumor volumes of the control, DADA-, and
DCA-treated mice increased from 82.5 ± 21.6, 80.4 ± 16.8,
and 81.2 ± 25.5 mm3 on Day 0 to 1,575.7 ± 253.3, 765.9
± 180.6, and 267.6 ± 57.2 mm3 on Day 24, respectively.
The tumor volumes of DCA-treated mice (765.9 ± 180.6
mm3) were significantly smaller than those in control mice
(1,575.7 ± 253.3 mm3) (P < 0.05); the tumor volumes of
DADA-treated mice (267.6 ± 57.2 mm3) were significantly
smaller than those in DCA-treated mice (765.9 ± 180.6
mm3) (P < 0.05). On Day 24, all tumors were isolated for
analysis. The smallest tumors were found in the DADAtreated group, with average tumor weights of 0.23 ±
0.04, 0.52 ± 0.08, and 0.85 ± 0.07 g for DADA, DCA,
and control mice, respectively. Both DCA and DADA
treatments significantly inhibited tumor growth compared
with the control (Figure 2C and 2D). In conclusion, the in
vivo experiments showed that 0.0004 mol/kg DADA had
stronger anti-tumor capabilities than did 0.0008 mol/kg
DCA.

vigorous in control mice, while tumor necrosis, fibrosis,
and inflammation were clearly observed in DADA- and
DCA-treated mice (Figure 3, left). We then evaluated
Ki67 expression in tumors isolated from control, DCA, and DADA-treated mice using immunohistochemical
staining. Ki67 was highly expressed in the tumors of
control and DCA-treated mice, while its expression was
greatly reduced in the tumors DADA-treated mice (Figure
3, right). In conclusion, DADA intervention reduced Ki67
expression.

DADA inhibits lactic acid production and
reduces glucose uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells
DCA is an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase, and can increase aerobic oxidation of glucose
and reduce lactic acid production in various tumor cells.
DCA mainly affects tumor cells and has little effect on
the metabolism of normal cells. Because the effective
component of DADA is DCA, we investigated whether
DADA could also inhibit lactic acid production and
reduce glucose uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells
were incubated with 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, or 20.0 mmol/L
DADA or DCA, and the concentration of lactic acid in
the supernatant was determined after 48 h. As shown in
Figure 4A, the lactic acid concentration decreased in a
concentration-dependent manner in both DADA- and
DCA-treated cells. Using a concentration of 10 mmol/L,
the lactic acid concentration of DADA-treated cells was
20.7 ± 1.2 mmol/L, which was significantly lower than that
in DCA-treated cells (28.9 ± 0.9 mmol/L) (P < 0.05) This
difference was more significant when the concentrations
of DADA and DCA were increased to 20 mmol/L (P <
0.01). Cells were incubated with 10 mM DADA and DCA

histopathological examination. H&E staining showed
that subcutaneous transplantation tumor growth was

As shown in Figure 4B, the acetic acid concentration of
DADA-treated cells was lower than that of DCA-treated
cells, and this difference was significant after 48 h.

Glucose consumption in MDA-MB-231 cells was
also evaluated. Glucose consumption decreased after DCA
and DADA treatment in a concentration-dependent manner.
The glucose consumption of cells treated with 10mM

DADA decreased more significantly than cells treated
with 10mM DCA (Figure 4C). The time course assay also
revealed that the glucose consumption of DADA-treated
cells was significantly less than that of DCA-treated cells
after 48-h treatment (Figure 4D). Taken together, DADA
changed the energetic metabolism of MDA-MB-231 cells,
and its effect was stronger than that of DCA.

Next, to evaluate whether the vacuoles were
associated with autophagy, we examined p62 and
LC3. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with a final
concentration of 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10 mmol/L DADA for
24 or 48 h. The levels of p62 and LC3 in the cells were
evaluated by Western blot. As shown in Figure 5B, the
levels of p62 and LC3 increased gradually with DADA
concentration. When the concentration of DADA reached
10 mmol/L, both the p62 and LC3 levels increased greatly
when compared with no treatment (Figure 5B). These
results suggest that the vacuoles in the tumor cells were
positively correlated with the levels LC3 and p62.
To determine the time course of p62 and LC3
levels, the DADA concentration was set at 10 mmol/L,
and the levels of p62 and LC3 were evaluated after
0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. As shown in Figure 5C, the
LC3 level increased with incubation time, which
suggested that persistent autophagy was induced by
DADA throughout the treatment. Interestingly, p62
levels were low at the beginning of treatment, but were
undetectable after 12 h of treatment; however, the p62
levels increased dramatically after 24 h of treatment
(Figure 5C). These results suggest that DADA may
induce autophagy, and that cells can degrade the
autophagosome during early phases of treatment but
cannot degrade the autophagosome at later stages of
treatment, which could lead to cell death.

DADA induces complete autophagy in early
stages of treatment and incomplete autophagy in
late stages of treatment
Other metabolism-related processes, including
autophagy, are altered in cancer cells. Cancer cells modulate
autophagy to fight against an unfavorable microenvironment
and promote cell survival. However, continued and
excessive autophagy can lead to autophagic cell death.
Previous studies found that DCA can inhibit tumor growth
via autophagy induction [26, 27]. To determine the role of
autophagy, MDA-MB-231 cells and two non-tumorigenic
epithelial cell lines (MCF 10A and ECV304) were treated
with 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10 mmol/L DADA for 24 h. The cells
were observed under an optical microscope, and unequalsized vacuoles were observed in a concentration-dependent
manner in treated cells (Figure 5A). In contrast, the above
cellular pathological characteristics were not observed in
the two non-tumorigenic epithelial cell lines (Figure 5A).

examination with H&E and Ki67 staining assays.

DISCUSSION

To confirm this possibility, chloroquine, an inhibitor
of autophagy, was used in the following experiments.
Cells were incubated with or without 5 mmol/L DADA
for 19 h, and then incubated with or without 10 μM/L
chloroquine for an additional 5 h. The p62 and LC3 levels
were then examined. As shown in Figure 5D, the p62
and LC3 levels increased to a greater degree in DADAtreated cells compared with untreated cells after adding
chloroquine, suggesting that excessive autophagy occurred
in DADA-treated cells.
To observe the intracellular accumulation of p62
during excessive autophagy, and to confirm the cellular
location of p62, the cells were transfected with a plasmid
encoding red fluorescent protein and p62. The relationship
between p62 expression and vacuole formation was
examined after treatment with 10mM DADA for 24 h
through confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 5E, no
vacuoles were observed in control cells, and the level of
red fluorescent protein was lower compared with DADAtreated cells. In contrast, vacuoles were seen in DADAtreated cells and the level of red fluorescence was higher,
confirming that p62 was located in the autophagosome
membrane.

As an inhibitor of the 3-phosphoinositide dependent
protein kinase 1 (PDPK1)–4 family, DCA reportedly
inhibits tumor proliferation by reversing the bio-energetic
profile of cancer cells [26, 27]. A study on the safety
and efficacy of DCA in glioblastoma and other recurrent
brain tumors is ongoing (https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/
NCT01111097). As a derivative of DCA, DADA or C6H15-N.C2-H2-Cl2-O2, composed of diisopropylamine
and DCA, is an over-the-counter drug used to treat
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [28]. However, few studies
have examined its potential for treating breast cancer.
In this report, our in vitro data showed that the IC50
of DADA against the MDA-MB-231 cell line was 7.1 ±
1.1 mmol/L, which was significantly lower than that of
DCA (15.6 ± 2.0 mmol/L). In addition, no cytotoxicity
was observed in ECV304 and MCF 10A non-tumor cell
lines, even using a 20mM concentration. Secondly, in
vivo experiments showed that a 100 mg/kg (0.0004 mol/
kg) DADA gavage inhibited tumor growth to a greater
degree than 100 mg/kg (0.0008 mol/kg) DCA, suggesting
that DADA has a greater potential for treating cancer

through oral administration. Histological examination
also showed that DADA and DCA induced tumor
necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, and that DADA
may inhibit Ki67 expression, suggesting that DADA may
inhibit mitosis. The effect of DADA on MDA-MB-231
cell metabolism was greater than that of DCA, and the
levels of lactic acid production and glucose uptake were
inhibited to a greater degree by DADA compared with
DCA. Results from autophagy studies also revealed that
DADA may induce complete autophagy in earlier stages
of treatment, and incomplete autophagy and cell death in
later stages of treatment, which may be one of its major
anti-cancer effects.
Previous reports have demonstrated that DCA has
anti-cancer effects due to its ability to inhibit pyruvate
dehydrogenase, reverse glycolysis, and increase oxidative
phosphorylation in cancer cells [26, 27, 29-33]. However,

these effects are still disputed, and opposing results have
been found in studies using colorectal cancer models
[27]. For breast cancer, in vitro experiments performed
on human breast epithelial carcinoma cells (T-47D)
showed that the combination of DCA and arsenic trioxide
was more effective at inhibiting cell proliferation and
inducing cell death than either drug alone [34]. In vivo,
DCA treatment resulted in a 58% reduction in the number
of lung metastases after injection of 13762 MAT rat
mammary adenocarcinoma cells [35]. Our data showed
that DCA and DADA both possessed anticancer capacities,
and had in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects on MDAMB-231 cells.
Although we had not evaluated the effects of DADA
on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, our data that DADA
inhibits lactic acid production and reduces glucose uptake
in MDA-MB-231 cells reflected the effects of DADA on

pyruvate dehydrogenase activity indirectly. Regarding to
the difference in the efficacy of DADA and DCA on the
basis of pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibitory activities, the
molecular radicals, diisopropylamine in DADA molecule,
should play a key role in this difference.
Cells maintain a basal level of autophagy to maintain
cell homeostasis [36]. Autophagy is increased to recycle
damaged cellular organelles and excess metabolites when
cells are exposed to hypoxia, nutrient starvation, growth
factor deficits, endoplasmic reticulum stress, accumulation
of abnormal products, or organelle injury [36, 37]. Tumor
cells can take advantage of this mechanism to survive
[36]. However, recent research shows that autophagy
may also suppress cancer growth. Lin et al. demonstrated
that DCA induced autophagy in colorectal cancer cells,
and that DCA treatment decreased pS6 ribosomal protein
and translation repressor protein (p4E-BP1) expression,
and increased monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1 and
autophagy [26].
In this study, the time course experiments
revealed that p62 levels decreased during the first 3–12
h of treatment, but then increased after 24–48 h. These
results suggest that DADA induces complete autophagy
during the early phases of treatment and incomplete
autophagy during the later stages of treatment, and that
a high dose of DADA may result in cell death. Together,
the results suggest that three main mechanisms may be
responsible for the anti-tumor effects of DADA. First,
DADA may suppress ki67 expression and inhibit cancer
cell proliferation. Second, DADA could reverse energy
metabolism in cancer cells, and third, DADA could induce
excessive autophagy and death in cancer cells.
Cell death is a prominent feature of malignant
tumors, and occurs in three forms: apoptosis, necroptosis,
and autophagy [17, 38]. A recent report by Lin et al.
showed that DCA treatment induced autophagy in HT29
tumors with minimal apoptosis [26]. Necroptosis is
associated with unprogrammed cell death resulting from
cellular damage or pathogen infection [38]. Together,
these results suggest that cell death plays a role in the anticancer effect of DADA.
DADA has been used as an over-the-counter drug
for decades; thus, its safety has been proven [28, 39].
TOXNET indicates that DADA can stimulate smooth
muscle and strongly inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity
(http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/rn/660-27-5).
The median lethal dose (LD50) of oral treatment in mouse
is as high as 1700 mg/kg [40]. In this report, 100 mg/kg
DADA inhibits tumor growth significantly. Our in vitro
data shows that, no cytotoxicity was observed in ECV304
and MCF 10A non-tumor cell lines, even using a 20mM
concentration (Figure 5A). In addition, a recent study
examined DCA and DADA toxicity, and found that mice
implanted with 0.864g DCA or 1.635g DADA-loaded
electrospun mats under the subcutaneous layer produce
minimal extra physiological toxicity at doses with optimal

anti-cancer activity [27]. In conclusion, this study provides
evidence for the potential application of DADA in the
treatment of breast cancer.

before adding the biotin-labeled rat anti-rabbit antibody
(1:200; Biovisualab, Shanghai, China) diluted in 0.1%
PBS and incubating at room temperature for 20 min. After
rinsing three times, chromogenic detection was performed
using 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Thermo Fisher,
Nanjing, China). Histological examinations were conducted
and photographs were taken using a NanoZoomer 2.0-RS
optical microscope (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu,
Japan).

Energy metabolism targeting analysis
To evaluate the effect of DCA and DADA on energy
metabolism, lactic acid production and glucose uptake
were measured in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells were
treated with 0.0 to 20.0 mmol/L DADA or DCA, and lactic
acid and glucose concentrations were measured after 48 h
using a Lactic Acid Test Kit (ChemWorld, Kennesaw, GA)
and a Glucose Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). To
observe the time course of DCA or DADA treatment on
lactic acid production and glucose uptake, DADA or DCA
concentrations were set at 10 mmol/L, and lactic acid and
glucose concentrations were measured at 6, 12, 24, and
48 h.

Autophagy assay
To determine the role of autophagy following
DADA treatment, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and
two non-tumorigenic epithelial cell lines, MCF 10A and
ECV304, were treated with 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10 mmol/L
DADA for 24 h. Autophagy was first observed under an
optical microscope. To evaluate whether autophagy was
altered by DADA in a concentration-dependent manner,
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with
0.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10 mmol/L DADA for 24 or 48 h. The
levels of two autophagic markers, autophagy degradation
receptor (p62) and microtubule-associated protein1 light
chain 3 (LC3), were detected by Western blot. Primary
antibodies against p62 and LC3 were purchased from
Biovisualab, Shanghai, China. To determine the time
course of autophagy, cells were incubated with 10 mmol/L
DADA, and p62 and LC3 levels were evaluated after 0, 3,
6, 12, 24, and 48 h. To prove that incomplete autophagy
occurred, cells were incubated with or without 5 mmol/L
DADA for 19 h and then incubated with or without 10
μM/L chloroquine (Sigma-Aldrich, Nanjing, China) for
an additional 5 h. The p62 and LC3 levels were evaluated
by Western blot. To confirm the position of p62, MDAMB-231 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoded
with red fluorescent protein and p62, after incubation
with or without 10 mmol/L DADA for 24 h, the cellular
location of p62 and vacuoles were checked using confocal
laser scanning microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

Subcutaneous transplantation tumor model
Six- to 8-week-old female nude BALB/c mice
(16.8 ± 0.2 g) were purchased from the Animal Research
Institute of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China. An
experimental breast carcinoma was created in vivo by
subcutaneous transplantation of 5 × 106 MDA-MB-231
cells (suspended in 100 µL of 10% Matrigel®, BD
Biosciences, Nanjing, China) into the right rear flanks of
BALB/c mice. Tumor growth was observed every day, and
tumor volume was calculated by the formula: volume =
length × width2/2. When the tumor volume reached 100–
150mm3, the mice were divided into control, DCA, and
DADA groups (n = 5 in each group). The mice groups
were lavaged once a day with 100 µL 0.9% saline, 100
mg/kg DADA (0.0004 mol/kg), and 100 mg/kg DCA
(0.0008 mol/kg) for 24 d. Tumor volumes were measured
every 3 d, and isolated and weighed after 24 d.

Statistical analysis

Histological examination

Data are shown as the mean ± standard deviation
(SD). Differences among groups were examined using a
Kruskal–Wallis H test or a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). The level of statistical significance was set at
0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0
for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).

After 24 d, all tumors were isolated for
histopathological examination. Following fixation of the
tumor samples in 10% formalin in phosphate buffer solution
(PBS), sections (4–5-μm thick) of the tumor tissues were
stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Ki67 is a nuclear
antigen associated with cell proliferation, and its function is
closely related to mitosis. To study the expression of Ki67,
immunohistochemical staining was performed on tumor
sections. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by
3% H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature. After rinsing
