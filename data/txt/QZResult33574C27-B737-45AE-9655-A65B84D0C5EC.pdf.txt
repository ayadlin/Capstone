ABSTRACT
The tumour suppressor p53 is regulated primarily at the protein level. In normal
tissues its levels are maintained at a very low level by the action of specific E3
ligases and the ubiquitin proteosome pathway. The mutant p53 protein contributes
to transformation, metastasis and drug resistance. High levels of mutant p53 can be
found in tumours and the accumulation of mutant p53 has previously been reported
in pathologically normal cells in human skin. We show for the first time that similarly
elevated levels of mutant p53 can be detected in apparently normal cells in a mutant
p53 knock-in mouse model. In fact, in the small intestine, mutant p53 spontaneously
accumulates in a manner dependent on gene dosage and cell type. Mutant p53 protein
is regulated similarly to wild type p53, which can accumulate rapidly after induction by
ionising radiation or Mdm2 inhibitors, however, the clearance of mutant p53 protein
is much slower than wild type p53. The accumulation of the protein in the murine
small intestine is limited to the cycling, crypt base columnar cells and proliferative
zone and is lost as the cells differentiate and exit the cell cycle. Loss of Mdm2 results
in even higher levels of p53 expression but p53 is still restricted to proliferating cells
in the small intestine. Therefore, the small intestine of these p53 mutant mice is an
experimental system in which we can dissect the molecular pathways leading to p53
accumulation, which has important implications for cancer prevention and therapy.

INTRODUCTION

spindle damage or oncogenic stimuli. p53 is stabilized and
post-translationally modified to serve its transcriptional
activation function. The target genes of p53 include
Mdm2, which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation,
enabling an important negative feedback loop that restores
the low basal levels of p53 after activation [2-6].
The p53 protein is essential for the regulation of
cell proliferation, and mutant p53 over-expression is
usually seen in malignant tumours. Here the missense
mutant protein accumulates to high levels and extensive

The p53 tumour suppressor protein is a transcription
factor that activates genes responsible for acute radiationinduced death, cell cycle checkpoint function, induction
of apoptosis and senescence and tumour suppression.
Its inactivation is considered a key event in human
carcinogenesis. As a “guardian of the genome” [1], in
normal tissues p53 protein is rapidly activated by different
cellular stress pathways, such as DNA damage, hypoxia,

immunohistochemical studies have shown that this
accumulation is highly variable and that mutation alone
is not sufficient to drive accumulation in all cells in the
tumour leading to complex and variable staining patterns
[7]. Mutation of the p53 gene results in loss of its tumour
suppressive transcriptional activation properties and gain
of novel oncogenic functions that are dependent on high
level expression [8]. Germline mutations in p53 cause LiFraumeni Syndrome, which is characterised by the early
onset of cancer in a wide variety of possible tissue types
[9,10]. Genetic and xenograft data from mouse models
have shown that the restoration of wild type p53 activity
is a potential anticancer strategy [11-16].
Small intestinal epithelium has a remarkable
rate of self-renewal which provides a daily readout of
proliferative activity [17]. The epithelium of the murine
small intestine renews every 5 days [18,19]. Each small
intestinal crypt contains approximately six long-lived stem
cells (crypt base stem cell, CBC) and these cells divide
every day [20]. Their daughter cells consist of the transitamplifying (TA) crypt compartment and these cells divide
every 12-16 hours. They perform up to five rounds of
cell division while migrating upwards [21]. The Paneth
cells located between CBC cells reside at the crypt base
for 3-6 weeks [22]. When TA cells reach the crypt-villus
junction, they rapidly differentiate as villous epithelium.
We have made use of the murine small intestine system to
study mutant p53 expression in order to understand p53
expression in various cell populations of morphologically
normal tissues and its association with potential function
in initiation of preneoplasia/neoplasia.
We generated mice carrying a missense p53 R172H
mutation which corresponds to the p53 R175H hot spot
mutation in human tumours, and is associated with LiFraumeni Syndrome [23, 24]. This particular hot spot
mutation in the p53 DNA-binding domain results in a
protein that is transcriptionally inactive and has both
dominant negative and gain-of-function phenotypes [8].
It is generally considered that p53 is mainly regulated at
the protein rather than the transcriptional level, and mutant
p53 protein is stable in human cancers but unstable in
normal tissues [25]. In previous studies in mouse [25]
and zebrafish [26] models where the animal’s wild type
p53 genes had been eliminated and replaced with mutant
p53. It was reported that the mutant p53 proteins did not
accumulate in normal tissues but reached very high levels
of expression in the tumours that arose in these animals.
In both the mouse and Zebrafish models the inactivation of
the Mdm2 gene in a homozygous mutant p53 background
results in the high level expression of the mutant p53 in
many normal tissues [25, 26]. In this study, we show that
mutant p53 protein is detectably expressed in a specific
cell population of morphologically normal small intestine
and also in other tissues in both absence and presence of
p53-activating signals and even in the presence of active
Mdm2. This level of expression is much higher than that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

seen for the wild type protein in unstressed tissues. We
show using the Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin in vivo that the
mutant p53 levels are further increased by pharmacological
inhibition of Mdm2 and are also induced by DNA damage.
Importantly this allowed us to explore the possibility that
down-regulation of wild type and mutant p53 protein in
differentiated small intestinal epithelium occurs at the
transcriptional level and to detect gene dosage effects on
protein expression.

RESULTS
Heterogeneous expression of p53 R172H protein
in morphologically normal adult mouse tissues
R172H mutant p53 protein (mutp53) levels may be
elevated in preneoplastic cells, therefore we examined
morphologically normal tissues in the p53R172H/R172H mice
to study the expression of mutp53. We found that in the
majority of apparently normal adult mouse tissues, there
is a heterogeneous expression of mutp53 and we were
able to divide mutp53 accumulation in mouse organs into
four groups according to staining intensity and positive
cell fraction in the population (Figure 1). Mutp53 4+:
small intestine, colon, rectum and thymus; mutp53 3+:
bone marrow of vertebrae and femur, spleen, growing
skin and hair follicle, mutp53 2+: kidney, nonglandular
& glandular stomach and ependyma of brain; mutp53 1+:
testis, pancreas & islet of Langerhan, lung and cornea.
There is no detectable immunostaining of mutp53 in liver,
brain (except ependyma) and skeletal muscle.
In p53R172H/R172H mice, mutp53 accumulation was
confined to the crypts of the small intestine. In colon
and rectum, mutp53+ was accumulated in lower 2/3 of
crypts. Mutp53 accumulation in thymus was detected
both in cortex and medulla and was more pronounced
in the medullary compartment. In spleen, mutp53+ cells
distribute both in red pulp and white pulp, more mutp53+
cell populations are located in the red pulp. In bone marrow
of vertebrae and femur, scattered mutp53 immuno-positive
cell populations were found amongst the hematopoietic
cells. Mutp53 accumulation is observed in growing skin
and anagen hair follicles. In kidney, mutp53 expression is
only found in the proximal convoluted tubules located in
renal cortex while mutp53 was undetectable in glomeruli
and medulla. Mutp53 accumulated in basal layers of
nonglandular stomach and scattered expression is seen
in the upper part of corpus region of stomach. Mutp53 is
only expressed in the spermatogonium of testis, and the
ependyma of brain. Mutp53 expression is not prominent
in pancreas and lung. Mutp53 is immunonegative in liver,
brain (except ependyma) and skeletal muscle. There was
very weak or non-identifiable p53 staining in p53 wild
type mouse tissues, and as expected there was no p53

Intriguingly, in p53R172H/KO mice, which bear a single
mutant p53 allele, p53 R172H protein was found at low
levels in all the tissues in which we detected mutp53
staining in the p53R172H/R172H mice. Therefore, p53 protein
levels in tissue of p53 R172H mice are dependent on gene
dosage (Suppl Figure 1).

The pattern of p53 immunopositivity in the small
intestine (Figure 2A, 3A, Suppl Figure 2 and Cover page)
was particularly interesting. No p53 protein was detected

polyclonal rabbit antibody which reacts strongly with p53
and has no background staining in p53-null mice using
immunofluorescent staining (Suppl. Figure 2). Therefore,
p53 protein levels in the crypts of the small intestine

are dependent on genotype and gene dosage, which was
further validated by Western blot when we extracted

levels between one allele or two alleles of the p53 R172H
mutant gene (Figure 2B). We could detect elevated and
dosage dependent mutp53 protein expression in p53R172H/KO
and p53R172H/R172H mouse small intestine, while only weak
bands were detected in p53 wild type mice.
We could detect increased p53 R172H protein in
the intestinal crypts of p53R172H pups as early as one week
after birth. The effect of gene dosage on p53 protein levels
was very clear in pups at just two weeks of age (Figure
2C). In p53R172H/R172H pups, p53 R172H protein levels were
high in every crypt and remained low but detectable in
their p53R172/KO littermates. Strong mutp53 staining is
also observed in pseudostratified epithelium of gut tube
at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) and in nascent crypts
after villus emergence happens at E16 in p53R172H/R172H
embryos (Figure 2D). Taken together, these data indicate
that the accumulation of mutant p53 protein in intestinal
crypts is detectable throughout embryo development, and
soon after birth as well as in adult mice and confirm that

it is dependent on cell type and gene dosage at all ages
examined.

Expression of p53 R172H protein confined to
cycling and proliferating cells of morphological
normal adult small intestine
Mupt53 accumulation in crypts of the small intestine
is of particular interest given the well characterised
location of stem and differentiated cell populations in
this dynamic tissue. This epithelium is the most rapidly
self-renewing tissue in adult mammals, and can be clearly
divided into three kinds of epithelium: the cycling crypt
base columnar (CBC) stem cells adjacent to differentiated
Paneth cells, proliferating transit-amplifying (TA) cells,
and differentiated villous epithelium [20]. Our mutp53 in
situ immunostaining indicated that mutp53 accumulated in
the cycling CBC and rapid proliferating TA cells (Figure
3A, orange and brown arrows) but not in the Paneth cells

crypts from mice of the various p53 genotypes and
cultured them in vitro as organoids. We could not detect
p53 by immunostaining in organoids from mice that were
p53-null (data not shown). However, the organoids from
p53R172H/R172H mice stained strongly for p53 while those
from p53R172H/KO mice showed weak p53 immunopositivity
(Figure 3B). Therefore, the organoids showed the same
trend of mutant p53 accumulation as that seen in the mice.
Next we further explored whether p53 R172H
affects cell proliferation in morphological normal tissues.
We co-stained mutp53 and PCNA by immunostaining,
more PCNA positive cells were found in crypts of p53

and differentiated villous cells of morphological normal
small intestine (Figure 3A, Cyanic and blue arrows).
Stem cell marker Lgr5 is exclusively expressed in cycling
columnar cells at the crypt base which is accepted as a
stem cell marker of small intestine [20]. We found no
change of Lgr5 mRNA expression among p53R172H/R172H,
p53+/+ and p53KO/KO mouse small intestine, examined
by qRT-PCR and by FISH procedures. Lgr5 mRNA
Expression was confined to the CBC population in all
these three genotypes (Suppl Figure 3A, 3B).
To further validate mutp53 protein accumulation
in stem cells of the small intestine, we isolated intestinal

R172H mouse than in p53 wild type mice, although the
intensity of PCNA staining in both p53 wild type and p53
R172H mutant is similar. The mutp53 positive staining cell
population was always found within the PCNA expressing
cell population (Figure 3C).

p53 R172H protein levels in most crypts took up to 25
hours to return to basal levels (Figure 4, right panel).
Therefore, ionising radiation rapidly induced both wild
type and mutant p53 protein in intestinal crypts, but wild
type p53 protein returned to basal levels more quickly than
did mutant p53.

p53 R172H protein accumulates rapidly after
induction by ionising radiation but clears more
slowly than wild type p53

Nutlin induces the rapid accumulation of p53
R172H protein in intestinal crypts
We then tested whether we could similarly detect
p53 induction after drug treatment. We used the small
molecule nutlin, which blocks the interaction between
p53 and its major negative regulator Mdm2, thereby
preventing p53 degradation and inducing its activity
[16]. As in the experiment with ionising radiation, we
compared p53 protein levels in the small intestines of
p53KO/+ mice with those in their p53R172H/KO littermates at
various time-points after drug administration. We could
detect slight accumulation of p53 wild type protein 2
hours onward after nutlin treatment (Figure 5, left panel)
whereas there was a clear increase in mutant p53 protein
levels detectable 2 hours after nutlin administration and
this was sustained at the 7.5 hour time-point (Figure 5,
right panel). These data affirm the utility of the p53 mutant
mice as a sensitive system to study p53 accumulation in
vivo, although the p53 wild type mice are still valuable for
studies of specific p53 target gene activation. They also
confirm that the degradation of mutant p53 is due to the
action of Mdm2 since it is inhibited by nutlin.

Given that p53 is often stabilised upon activation
[27,28], studying p53 accumulation in vivo could provide
information on p53 induction upon drug treatment that
would be relevant for the optimisation of chemotherapeutic
regimens. To this end, studying the intestine is particularly
important because 20-40% of all adverse effects arising
from drug treatment are attributed to events in the small
and large intestine [29]. For example, p53 plays a major
role in the apoptosis of stem cells within the intestinal
crypt [30,31], which can contribute to gastrointestinal
toxicity [32]. The crypts of the small intestine also contain
proliferating cells that are sensitive to ionizing radiation
[31,33].
Given that we observed distinct mutp53 expression
in the small intestine that was dependent on gene
dosage, we sought to use the small intestine of these p53
mutant mice as an experimental system to examine p53
induction. We first subjected the mice to whole body
ionising radiation and performed a time course experiment
to compare the response of wild type p53 protein in
p53KO/+ mice with that of mutant p53 in their p53R172H/KO
littermates. Just 3 hours after 2 Gy ionising radiation, we
could detect elevated levels of both wild type and mutant
p53 protein levels in the same crypt cells in which high
p53 R172H protein levels had been observed in p53R172H/
R172H
mice (Figure 4). Irradiation induces apoptosis and the
accompanying loss of cellularity can complicate analysis
of immunohistochemical data. Nonetheless, it is still clear
that basal protein levels of wild type p53 were restored 8
hours after irradiation (Figure 4, left panel). In contrast,

Loss of Mdm2 results in even higher levels
of p53 expression but p53 is still restricted to
proliferating cells in the small intestine
In prior work on both the p53R172H/R172H mice
and p53R172H/R172H zebrafish we were not able to detect
mutant p53 accumulation in normal tissues though it
was readily seen when these animals were crossed onto

Mdm2-null backgrounds [25, 26]. We at first considered
that this readily detection of mutant p53 accumulation
in mice with Mdm2 could be due to the effect of other
background genes of the p53 mutant mice but comparison
of the staining methods used encouraged us to re-examine
tissues from these mice using the sensitive antibodies
and processing methods developed in the current studies.
These showed that the differences in the current results
are indeed due to the increased sensitivity of the current
protocols. As shown in Figure 6A staining for p53 is
indeed detectable in the crypt cells of the mice previously
described as negative for p53. The striking increase in
intensity of p53 staining in the Mdm2-null background
(Figure 6B) does however completely confirm the earlier
conclusions of the importance of Mdm2 in regulating
mutant p53 levels in vivo. In support however of the
additional regulation of p53 by transcriptional control we
note that even in these intensely stained specimens p53
is confined to the crypt cells and is not expressed in the
differentiated cells of the villi.

negative regulator, the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 [25, 35].
Previous data indicated that the transcriptionally inactive
mutant p53 cannot induce Mdm2 expression, which could
partly explain the longer half-life of the protein in cells
after induction [35]. There is no expression of p21 protein
in p53 R172H mice as expected (Figure 7), indicating p53
R172H mutant mouse model we generated also lost its p53
transcriptional capacity which is consistent with previous
reports [35].
Many different types of cancer show a high
incidence of p53 mutations, leading to the expression of
mutant p53 proteins. Although we are unable to validate
whether the properties and induction of the mutp53 protein
in these morphologically normal tissues are the same as
that of the mutp53 protein in tumours, we did find that
increased mutp53 protein accumulation is more relevant
to cell and tissue types with high proliferative rate such as
small intestine, thymus, spleen and anagen hair follicles.
The accumulation of mutp53 protein is not spontaneous or
uncontrolled, it occurs in a cell- and tissue-specific manner
(Figure 1). The high accumulation of the mutp53 protein
within the crypts is remarkable. We stained large numbers
of sections from small intestine of different p53 R172H
mice, we generally only detected elevated mutp53 protein
in cycling CBC and rapidly proliferating TA cells within
the small intestinal crypts (Figures 3). Our study is the first
to describe elevated mutp53 protein levels in CBC and TA
cells of intestinal crypts. Although we do not understand
whether and how elevated mutant p53 proteins might
perturb intestinal stem cells and affect tumorigenesis, this
p53 R172H mouse model will provide a valuable tool
for understanding the role of mutant p53 protein in the
cancer initiation. In human specimens clusters of intensely
stained p53 positive nuclei have been seen in clones
present in skin [37] and fallopian tube (p53 signatures)

DISCUSSION
Previous reports have shown that the levels of
mutant p53 protein are often increased in tumours but
not in normal tissue, both in mice [25] and in zebrafish
[34]. Our study is the first to describe elevated mutant
p53 protein levels in non-cancerous mouse tissues, which
may not have previously been detected due to differences
in immunostaining protocols and in the p53 antibody
used [24, 35]. Mutp53 protein is regulated similarly to
wild type p53 in our data (Figure 4, 5) and others [25,
36]. It is induced by stress and genotoxic damage such as
irradiation and degraded after ubiquitination by its major

MATERIALS AND METHODS

[38]. Sequencing of these signatures has shown that they
contain mutant p53. While high level expression of mutant
p53 is associated with pre-neoplastic conditions and
mutant p53 can act as a dominant transforming oncogene
our studies suggest that this is not a very penetrant state.
Mice expressing high levels of mutant p53 in the stem and
proliferating cells of their intestine from birth do not show
overt neoplastic effects in this tissue.
The mutp53 protein was not detected in
differentiated Paneth cells and villous epithelium of
small intestine as well as in other differentiated cells.
Differentiated Sertoli cells and spermatocytes were also
immuno-negative for mutp53, while spermatogonia
which are undifferentiated male germ cells express
elevated mutp53 protein. In stratified epithelia, such as
nonglandular stomach epithelium and skin, mutp53 was
detected in basal undifferentiated layers of these epithelia
but not in differentiated suprabasal layers (Figure 1).
This observation is consistent with previously published
data in mouse embryonic stem cells that p53 protein
levels and activity decrease upon differentiation [39,
40] and that it is more difficult to induce p53 activity in
differentiated cells [40]. This phenomenon was mostly
considered due to the post-translational regulation, which
leads to down-regulation of p53 protein in differentiated
cells. However in this study, whether treated by nutlin or
ionising irradiated, mutp53 protein cannot be induced in
differentiated villi and is always confined to the crypts
of the small intestine. This is even true when the Mdm2
gene is inactivated suggesting strongly that the lack of p53
expression may be due to inhibition of the p53 promoter
in differentiated cells
The anatomy of the small intestinal crypt and villus
are uniquely suited to study the properties of various
cell populations such as proliferating cells in crypts
and differentiated cells in villi of small intestine. It still
remains to be determined how p53 is down-regulated
after cell differentiation. Abnormal development and
incomplete differentiation are hallmarks of cancer, loss
of differentiation may be linked to p53 disruption in
tumourigenesis. Enforced differentiation in p53 mutant
cancer may become a powerful therapeutic tool in cancer
chemotherapy and drug discovery. This is because strong
evidence suggests that the high level expression on
mutant p53 drives the growth of the cancer and blocking
its expression inhibits tumour growth [41]. Our results
may also go a long way towards explaining the widely
discussed variability of p53 expression in human tumours
[42]. Clearly as shown here the dosage of mutant p53, the
activity of Mdm2 and the activity of the p53 promoter,
which is in turn linked to the state of proliferation, can
along with the sensitivity of the staining protocol used
have profound effects on the intensity of p53 staining
observed.

Mice
All mouse experiments were approved by the
A*STAR Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) and performed in compliance with IACUC
regulations. The Trp53 knockout mice and p53R172H mutant
mice were generated by crossing mice expressing Cre
under the control of the β-actin promoter [43] with Trp53
conditional knockout mice [44] and p53LSL•R172H conditional
mutant mice [35, 45] respectively. The generation of the
p53R172H/R172H; Mdm2-/- mice was reported previously
[25]. p53R172H mice maintained on a mixed 129S4/SvJae
x C57BL/6 background were used for p53 IHC staining.
Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis of DNA from
ear clips obtained at the time of weaning. Two-month-old
(mo) mice of the appropriate genotypes were subject to
total body irradiation using a single dose of 2 Gy and 8 Gy.
2 mo mice with same genotypes were treated with nutlin-3
(Nutlin, 200 mg/kg, Oral gavage). The mice were then
sacrificed at the specified times. To prevent infection, mice
sacrificed more than 24 hours after irradiation received
0.5 mg/ml amoxicillin, starting 3 days prior to irradiation.
Mouse tissues for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
immunofluorescent staining were fixed in 10% Neutral
Buffered Formalin and embedded in paraffin. Mouse
tissues for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were
fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) and submerged overnight at 4°C in 30%
sucrose/4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in OCT and
stored in -80C. All tissues analysed appeared normal at
the time of necropsy.

Immunohistochemistry and microscopy imaging
Immunostaining was performed on formalinfixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 5 µm sections. We
used commercial rabbit anti-p53 (CM5, 1:500, Leica
Biosystems, Germany) primary antibody and the p53
IHC procedure was performed by auto-staining machine
(Leica Bond-max, Leica Biosystems, Germany) to ensure
reproducibility of staining between experiments, the
procedure was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The most critical step for p53 IHC staining is
that we used EDTA based pH 9.0 antigen retrieval solution
to exposure antigen epitopes. Home-made polyclonal
rabbit anti-p53, commercial monoclonal mouse anti-p53
(1C12, 1:200, #2425S, Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, USA), rabbit anti-PCNA (1:100, sc-7907,
Santa Cruz), and mouse anti-p21 (1:20, F5, Santa Cruz)
primary antibodies and anti-rabbit/mouse Alexa Fluor
568/488 (1:500, Invitrogen, California, USA) secondary
antibodies were used for immunofluorescent staining.

IHC Images were captured with a Zeiss AxioImager
upright microscope using 20x and 40x objective lens.
Data presented are representative of results obtained from
at least 3 mice per group. Immunofluorescent staining
images were observed using an Olympus FV1000 upright
confocal microscope and captured at 405nm, 488nm, and
568nm using 40x and 100x objective lens, processing with
FV10-ASW 3.0 Viewer software.

(mouse: NM_010195) was designed by Probe Designer
at www.singlemoleculefish.com and synthesized by
Biosearch Technologies. The FISH probe set consists of
96 TMR fluorophore labelled oligonucleotides. ​DAPI
nuclear dye was included during the final wash. Images
were captured at 405nm and 568nm using 100x objective
len by an Olympus FV1000 upright confocal microscope.

In vitro culture of organoids from intestinal crypts

Protein extraction and western blot

Intestinal crypts were isolated and cultured in vitro
as described previously [48]. Organoids were washed and
fixed in 4% formaldehyde for an hour, then transferred to
70% ethanol before embedding in paraffin.

Mechanically separated crypts and villi of small
intestine [46], were homogenized and lysed using RIPA
buffer (25mM Tris•HCl pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40,
1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, Thermo Scientific,
#89901) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Supernatants were collected after centrifugation
at 14,000 r.p.m for 1 hour. Protein concentration was
determined by the BCA method (Pierce, Thermo
Scientific). Proteins were subjected to SDS−PAGE and
immunoblot analysis. Blots were probed sequentially
with primary and secondary antibodies at the following
dilutions: anti-p53 at 1:1000 (1C12, Cell Signaling), antiActin at 1:5000 (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis,
USA). Secondary HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and antirabbit were used at 1:10 000 (GE Healthcare, Chalfont
St Giles, UK). Proteins were detected by incubation with
ECL substrate (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, USA)
for 5 min and chemiluminescence was visualized by
STORM imaging system (Amersham, Pleasanton, USA).
