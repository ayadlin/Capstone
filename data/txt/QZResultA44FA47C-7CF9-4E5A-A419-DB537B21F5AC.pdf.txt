Abstract
To identify methylation-silenced genes in prostate cancers, a
microarray analysis for genes up-regulated by treatment with
a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine, was performed
using three rat prostate cancer cell lines. Eight genes (Aebp1,
Dysf, Gas6, LOC361288, Nnat, Ocm, RGD1308119, and Tgfbr2)
were re-expressed at 16-fold or more, and their promoter CpG
islands were shown to be densely methylated in the cancer cell
lines. From the eight genes, Tgfbr2, a key mediator of
transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B) signaling that has been
strongly implicated in human and rat prostate carcinogenesis,
was selected, and its silencing in primary samples was
analyzed further. Tgfbr2 was methylated and markedly
down-regulated in three of seven 3,2¶-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl–induced invasive adenocarcinomas in the dorsolateral
lobe of the rat prostate. In humans, marked down-regulation
of TGFBR2 protein was observed in 12 of 20 high-grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 36 of 60 prostate
cancers. DNA methylation of the human TGFBR2 promoter
CpG islands repressed transcription, if present, but neither
methylation nor mutation were detected in 27 human prostate
cancers analyzed. Methylation silencing of rat Tgfbr2 was
associated with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation, whereas
decreased expression of human TGFBR2 was mainly due to
decreased transcription activity, sometimes in concert with
histone deacetylation and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. The
identification of methylation silencing of Tgfbr2 in rat
prostate cancers, in accordance with TGFBR2 down-regulation in human prostate cancers, will enable us to analyze how
aberrant methylation is induced in vivo and identify factors
that promote and suppress the induction of aberrant
methylation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(7):2112–21]

Introduction
Gene silencing due to DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands
(CGIs) is one of the major mechanisms of tumor-suppressor gene
inactivation, along with mutations and loss of heterozygosity (1).
Many methylation-silenced tumor-suppressor genes have been
identified, and more will be revealed by genome-wide procedures
(2). In contrast, limited information is available on the mechanism
of how methylation silencing is induced in vivo and on the factors

that promote or suppress aberrant methylation. For example,
although chronic inflammation is known to be an inducer of
aberrant methylation in humans (3), the exact effector cells and
molecular changes in target cells are unknown. To address these
questions, animal models are indispensable. However, because we
select models by the presence of dense methylation of a promoter
CGI in cancer and by the meaningful expression of its downstream
gene in the corresponding normal tissue, only a limited number of
methylation-silenced genes have thus far been identified in animal
models (4–7).
Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in
men in most developed countries (8). To analyze molecular,
cellular, and physiologic events in prostate carcinogenesis, rodent
models have been used. Particularly in rats, prostate cancers can be
induced in an age-dependent manner in ACI/Seg and LoboundWistar strains, or by chemical carcinogens, and the effects of
androgens have been clearly shown (9). If methylation-silenced
genes involved in prostate carcinogenesis are found in rat prostate
cancers, they will enable us to analyze the molecular processes of
how aberrant methylation is induced in vivo as well as the factors,
including hormones, that influence the process.
To identify methylation-silenced genes in rat prostate cancers, a
chemical genomic screening method (2) was adopted for its
efficiency. This method screens genes re-expressed after treatment
with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC),
using a microarray. It is technically simple, and effective in
identifying methylation-silenced genes using cell lines. Three rat
prostate cancer cell lines, PLS10, PLS20, and PLS30 have been
established from three prostate cancers in the dorsolateral lobes
independently induced by 3,2¶-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB)
plus testosterone in male F344 rats (10, 11).
Here, we report the results of a chemical genomic screening
using PLS10, PLS20, and PLS30 cell lines. Among the genes whose
methylation silencing was confirmed, the transforming growth
factor-h (TGF-h) receptor type II gene (Tgfbr2), a key mediator of
TGF-h signaling that has been strongly implicated in human and
rat prostate carcinogenesis (12–19), was identified. We further
analyzed Tgfbr2 methylation and expression both in rat and human
prostate cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and their 5-aza-dC or trichostatin A treatment. PLS10
(well-differentiated adenocarcinoma), PLS20 (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma), and PLS30 (well-differentiated adenocarcinoma) were established from three independent transplantable tumor lines induced by
DMAB plus testosterone propionate in the dorsolateral lobes of F344 rats,
and maintained as reported (11). Human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3,
LNCaP, DU145, MDA-PCa-2b, and 22Rv1) and prostatic epithelial cells
immortalized by papillomavirus 18 (RWPE-1) were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection.

For treatment with 5-aza-dC, 2  105 cells (1  105 cells for PLS-10)/10
cm dish were seeded on day 0, and exposed to freshly prepared 10 Amol/L
5-aza-dC (Sigma) for 24 h on days 1 and 3. This dose suppressed cellular
growth rates to approximately half of nontreated cells. After each treatment,
the cells were placed in fresh medium and harvested on day 4. For
treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), cells were seeded at a half-confluent
density, and exposed to 100, 300, and 1,000 nmol/L of TSA (Sigma) for
24 h until harvest. Genomic DNA was extracted by standard phenol/
chloroform procedures. Total RNA was extracted using ISOGEN (Nippon
Gene) and purified using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen).
Primary prostate cancers and immunohistochemistry. To induce
prostate cancers, 6-week-old male F344 rats underwent subcutaneous
injection of 100 mg/kg of testosterone propionate and 50 mg/kg of DMAB,
which was repeated 10 times in a 2-week cycle, followed by the subcutaneous
implantation of a Silastic tube containing 40 mg of testosterone propionate
(10). The prostate was resected en bloc, examined for gross abnormalities,
and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. One sagittal slice was prepared for each
lobe, and embedded in paraffin. A 4-Am-thick section was stained with H&E.
Organ-confined prostate cancers were obtained from 60 patients (ages 49–77,
stage II–IV, Gleason pattern 2–5) who underwent prostatectomy. None of
these cancer patients had previously undergone chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
or hormonal therapy. All histologic diagnoses were made by experienced
pathologists (S. Takahashi and T. Shirai). DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue sections was extracted by heating the sections at 100jC for
20 min under pH 12 (20). The animal experiment protocols were approved by
the Committee for Ethics in Animal Experimentation at the National Cancer
Center.
TGFBR2 immunohistochemistry in rat and human prostate cancers was
performed using polyclonal anti-TGFBR2 antibody (L-21, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The areas with TGFBR2 protein expression were quantitatively measured by an Image Processor for Analytical Pathology (IPAP-WIN,
Sumika Technoservice), and regions that had an absorbance of one-third or
less of the normal prostate were considered to have TGFBR2 downregulation.
Oligonucleotide microarray analysis and database search. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed using a GeneChip Rat Genome
230 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) and GeneChip Operating Software as in our
previous studies (21, 22). Database searches were carried out at a GenBank
web site, and CGI were searched for based on (a) CpG score z 0.65, (b)
G + C content z 55%, and (c) length (z200, z300, or z500 bp).
Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. DNA from cell
lines was digested by BamHI and 1 Ag of digested DNA was denatured in 0.3
N NaOH at 37jC for 15 min. DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue sections was used without digestion (0.2–0.5 Ag each). The samples in

www.aacrjournals.org

3.6 N sodium bisulfite (pH 5.0) and 0.6 mmol/L of hydroquinone underwent
15 cycles of 30-s denaturation at 95jC and 15-min incubation at 50jC,
desalted and desulfonated with Zymo-Spin IC Columns (Zymo Research),
and were dissolved in 16 to 40 AL of TE buffer.
Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed with a primer set
specific to the methylated or unmethylated sequence (M or U set), using
0.5 AL (2.0 AL for DNA from formalin-fixed tissue) of the sodium
bisulfite–treated DNA. DNA methylated with SssI methylase (New
England Biolabs) and DNA amplified by a GenomiPhi DNA amplification
kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) was used as fully methylated and
unmethylated control DNA, respectively (23). Bisulfite sequencing was
performed with primers common to methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences, using 0.5 AL (1.0 AL for DNA from formalin-fixed tissue) of
the sodium bisulfite–treated DNA (22). Primer sequences are shown in
Supplementary Table S1.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and 5¶-rapid amplification
of cDNA ends. cDNA was synthesized from 1 Ag of total RNA using a
QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) with a random primer. Realtime PCR was performed using the 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) with SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo; ref. 22).
The copy number of a target gene was normalized to that of GAPDH in
human and cyclophilin A (Ppia) in rat (24). Primer sequences are shown in
Supplementary Table S2.
Rapid amplification of 5¶ complementary DNA ends (5¶ RACE) was
performed using a GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) on cDNA from AT6.3 and
MAT-LyLu rat prostate cancer cell lines that abundantly expressed Tgfbr2.
After the first and second PCR using LA Taq (Takara Bio), the PCR product
was cloned into a pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega), and a total of 54 clones
were sequenced using a DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit
(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and an ABI310 DNA sequencer (Applied
Biosystems).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Cells (1.5  106) were
treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature for crosslinking, and the reaction was quenched by adding glycine. Cells were lysed
in the SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Upstate), and DNA
was sonicated to a size of 100 to 3,000 bp by Bioruptor UCD-250 (Cosmo
Bio). To the sonicated solution, anti-K4 dimethylated histone H3 (H3K4me2,
Upstate), anti-K9 trimethylated histone H3 (H3K9me3, Upstate), or anti-K27
trimethylated histone H3 (H3K27me3, Upstate) was added, and the mixture
was incubated at 4jC overnight with rotation. The resultant immune
complexes were collected using Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen Dynal AS),
and washed with Immune Complex Wash Buffer (Upstate). The cross-link
was reversed by incubation for 5 h at 65jC in the presence of 0.3 mol/L of
NaCl. DNA was recovered by treatment with RNase and proteinase K,

phenol/chloroform extraction, and isopropanol precipitation. The number
of DNA molecules precipitated from a specific starting volume of the
sonicated solution was compared with the number of DNA molecules in the
same volume of the sonicated solution (whole cell extract). The number of
DNA molecules was quantified by real-time PCR (primer sequences in
Supplementary Table S1).
Luciferase reporter assay using a promoter with DNA methylation
of a specific region. The 5¶ region of human TGFBR2 was amplified using

an upper primer (5¶-CCAGGAATGTCTTGGGCAAA-3¶) and a lower primer
(5¶-CCAGCGCAGCGGACG-3¶) and cloned into a SmaI site of the pGL3Basic vector (Promega). To methylate a specific region within the reporter
plasmid, the region was excised and methylated twice by SssI methylase.
The methylated DNA fragment and the mock-treated DNA fragment
(treatment without S-adenosylmethionine) were ligated back into the
remaining arm using Ligation high (Toyobo). Nonessential regions within
the reporter plasmid were digested with SacI, BamHI, and FspI. Then,

a SacI-BamHI fragment that contained TGFBR2 promoter and luciferase

Along with a control plasmid for transfection efficiency (3 ng phRL-TK;
Promega), 30 ng of the SacI-BamHI fragment was transiently transfected
into PC3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen)
with Opti-MEM I Reduced-Serum Medium (Invitrogen) in a 96-well format.
At 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was

amplified using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase with HF Buffer (New

(Supplementary Table S2).

Results
Genes up-regulated by 5-aza-dC treatment and their
methylation analysis. Three rat prostate cancer cell lines

www.aacrjournals.org

(PLS10, PLS20, and PLS30) were treated with 10 Amol/L of 5-azadC, and up-regulated genes were searched for using an oligonucleotide microarray. Among >28,000 genes and expressed sequence
tags analyzed by the microarray, 47, 13, and 10 annotated genes (59
nonredundant annotated genes), respectively, were up-regulated at
16-fold or more (signal log ratio z4) in the three cell lines
(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). The presence of a putative
promoter CGI was examined by a database search, and 10, 3, and 1
genes (12 nonredundant genes) were found to have CGIs that
spanned 300 bp or more (Supplementary Table S3). Genes with
these CGIs were considered as candidates for novel methylationsilenced genes in rat prostate cancers.
To examine whether the induction of these genes by 5-aza-dC
treatment was due to demethylation of promoter CGIs, the
methylation statuses of the putative promoter CGIs were analyzed
by MSP. The CGIs of eight genes (Aebp1, Dysf, Gas6, LOC361288,
Nnat, Ocm, RGD1308119, and Tgfbr2) were completely methylated
before the treatment and demethylated after the treatment in at
least one of the three rat prostate cancer cell lines (Table 1). The

to be methylation-silenced in the rat prostate cancer cell lines.
Methylation silencing of Tgfbr2 in rat prostate cancer cell
lines. Interestingly, among the eight genes, Tgfbr2, a key mediator
of TGF-h signaling that has been implicated in human and rat
prostate carcinogenesis (12–19), was present. The methylation
silencing of Tgfbr2 was analyzed further. Generally, for methylation silencing, a dense DNA methylation of a region within a

promoter CGI, specifically a region devoid of nucleosome just
upstream of a transcription start site (TSS; nucleosome-devoid
region), is critical (26, 27). To search for any Tgfbr2 TSSs
additional to the one reported in osteoblasts (28), we performed
the 5¶ RACE method using rat prostate cancer cell lines. Several
TSSs were found to be located from +13 to +173 of the reported
Tgfbr2 TSS (NM_031132.3, National Center for Biotechnology
Information; Fig. 1A), and the region analyzed by MSP was
located at 178 to 22 of the multiple TSSs. Because this region

repression, the presence of dense methylation was confirmed by
bisulfite sequencing. PLS20 and PLS30 had only methylated DNA
molecules, and PLS10 had both methylated and unmethylated

quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in PLS20 and PLS30 cells
(Fig. 1D). The re-expression was associated with the appearance of
unmethylated DNA molecules by MSP (Fig. 1C). Expression of
Tgfbr2 in the normal prostate, which is important for functional
gene silencing in cancer, was confirmed. We concluded that Tgfbr2
was methylation-silenced in PLS20 and PLS30 rat prostate cancer
cell lines.
Tgfbr2 silencing in rat primary prostate cancers. DNA
methylation of the Tgfbr2 promoter CGI and its decreased protein
expression were analyzed in rat primary prostate cancers induced
by DMAB and testosterone. Using MSP, methylation was detected
in three of seven invasive adenocarcinomas in the dorsolateral
lobe, but in none of five noninvasive adenocarcinomas in the
ventral lobe (Fig. 2A). Using immunohistochemistry, protein
expression was found to be markedly decreased in the three
invasive adenocarcinomas with methylation, but was not decreased
in the remaining four invasive adenocarcinomas or in any of the
five noninvasive adenocarcinomas (Fig. 2B). The results obtained
by MSP were confirmed by bisulfite sequencing of two representative samples with and without methylation (Fig. 2C). These data
showed that the Tgfbr2 gene was methylation-silenced in rat
primary prostate cancers induced by DMAB and testosterone.
Methylation silencing of human TGFBR2, and its rare
occurrence. In humans, silencing of TGFBR2 due to dense DNA
methylation of its promoter CGI has been reported in a limited
number of cell lines (29), but has not been found in any primary
cancers. Unlike that of rat Tgfbr2, the ‘‘promoter CGI’’ of human
TGFBR2 is located mainly in its first exon, based on its welldocumented multiple TSSs (Fig. 3A; ref. 30), and CpG density
becomes lower in the promoter region. It is now known that DNA
methylation of a nucleosome-devoid region is critical for gene
silencing (26, 27), and that methylation of a promoter region with
intermediate or low CpG density does not necessarily repress the
transcription of its downstream gene (31). Therefore, we decided to
examine whether or not dense methylation of various regions of
human TGFBR2 could cause its silencing.
First, a 1,242 bp DNA fragment covering the human TGFBR2
TSSs and its promoter region was cloned. Then, the entire
fragment or three regions (regions 1, 2, and 3; shown in Fig. 3A
and B) and their combinations were specifically methylated, and
the effect was analyzed by a reporter assay. Methylation of region
1 only ( 893 to +39) and methylation of region 3 only (+104 to
+349) reduced the promoter activity to half of their unmethylated
controls (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, methylation of regions
1 and 2 ( 893 to +104) reduced the activity to 6% of its
unmethylated control. These data showed that dense methylation
of the human TGFBR2 CGI, if present, can repress transcription,
and indicated that methylation of region 2 is indispensable. Due
to the short size of region 2, data on methylation of region 2 only
could not be prepared.
MSP primers were designed in region 2 (MSP-3), the possible
nucleosome-devoid region, encompassing most TSSs, and methylation status was screened in 33 human cancer cell lines ( five
prostate, six ovarian, six lung, seven pancreatic, and nine stomach
cancer cell lines; data for prostate cancers in Fig. 3C). Only TYK-nu
(ovarian) and MIAPaCa-2 (pancreas) had TGFBR2 methylation
(data not shown). The lack of methylation in three prostate cancer
cell lines (PC3, LNCaP, and DU145) was confirmed by bisulfite
sequencing (Fig. 3C). When TGFBR2 mRNA expression was
examined, it was down-regulated to <10 4 of that of GAPDH in
LNCaP and to <10 3 in MDA-PCa-2b and 22Rv1 (Fig. 3D). These

data showed that silencing of TGFBR2 due to dense methylation of
its promoter region was rare among human cancer cell lines and
absent in the five human prostate cancer cell lines analyzed.
Lack of methylation of the TGFBR2 nucleosome-devoid
region, but its frequent down-regulation in primary human
prostate cancers. Methylation of the possible nucleosome-devoid
region (MSP-3) was analyzed in 27 primary human prostate
cancers by MSP. However, none of them showed methylation
(Fig. 4A). It has been reported that TGFBR2 expression is markedly
down-regulated in human prostate cancers (14–16), and we
confirmed this. Following immunohistochemical analysis of the
20 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), the 27
cancers, and an additional 33 cancers, down-regulation of TGFBR2
protein was observed in 12 of 20 HGPIN and 36 of 60 prostate
cancers (Fig. 4B and C). There was no correlation between
expression levels of TGFBR2 protein and histologic grade in human
prostate cancers. Finally, as a possible mechanism for decreased
TGFBR2 expression, its mutations were searched for. Mutations
were only detected in two prostate cancer cell lines (22Rv1 and
MDA-PCa-2b), but not in the 27 primary prostate cancers analyzed
(Fig. 4D).
Contrastive histone modifications in the rat and human
prostate cancer cell line with down-regulated Tgfbr2 expression. To analyze the molecular mechanisms causing downregulation of TGFBR2 in human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP
and 22Rv1), we first analyzed their transcriptional capacity by a
luciferase reporter assay using a 1,242 bp DNA fragment covering
the human TGFBR2 promoter and TSSs. The transcriptional
capacity of LNCaP and 22Rv1 was significantly lower than that
of PC3 and DU145 (Fig. 5A), although precise comparison of
transcription activities among different cell lines was difficult
because transfection and/or luminescence efficiencies were highly
variable (Supplementary Table S6). We also analyzed the histone
acetylation status in rat and prostate cancer cell lines by observing
the effect of 5-aza-dC or TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor.
LNCaP showed marked re-expression of TGFBR2 mRNA after TSA
treatment whereas 22Rv1 did not (Fig. 5B). This showed that, in
addition to decreased transcription capacity, histone deacetylation
was involved in the decreased TGFBR2 expression in LNCaP, but
not in 22Rv1.
Histone methylation status was further analyzed by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in the rat and human prostate
cancer cell lines. A rat cell line with Tgfbr2 methylation silencing
(PLS20) had increased H3K9me3, a typical mark for inactive
chromatin (32), whereas another rat cell line with Tgfbr2
expression (AT6.1) had increased H3K4me2, a typical mark for
active chromatin (ref. 32; Fig. 5C). In contrast, human prostate
cancer cell lines had both H3K4me2 and H3K27me3, and LNCaP,
which had histone deacetylation, had a marked increase of
H3K27me3 (Fig. 5C). These suggested that the loss of Tgfbr2
expression in a rat prostate cancer cell line (PLS20) was due to
DNA methylation, accompanied by the H3K9me3 modification, and
that the decreased TGFBR2 expression in a human prostate cancer
cell line was due to decreased transcriptional capacity in concert
with (LNCaP) or without (22Rv1) histone deacetylation and H3K27
trimethylation.

Discussion
Silencing of Tgfbr2 was identified in invasive adenocarcinomas
of the dorsolateral lobe of the rat prostate. This is the first report

Cancer Research

of Tgfbr2 silencing in animal cancers of any tissue, and of gene
silencing in rat prostate cancers. In animal models, only a limited
number of genes are known to be silenced by dense methylation
of a region just upstream of a TSS, within a CGI, a nucleosomedevoid region (26, 27), in skin, lung, hematologic, and renal
cancers (4–7). Our finding of Tgfbr2 silencing in prostate cancers
will enable us to analyze the processes of how aberrant
methylation is induced in vivo and the factors that promote
and suppress the induction of aberrant methylation, including
testosterone. Mouse prostate cancers induced by the SV40
polyoma virus early region are known to be prevented by a
demethylating agent, 5-aza-dC (33), but the genes responsible are
still indefinite.
Functional involvement of Tgfbr2 (TGFBR2) down-regulation
in rodent and human prostate carcinogenesis is strongly
supported in the literature. In rats, loss of TGF-h responsiveness
in prostate epithelial cells causes malignant transformation (18),
and prostate cancer sublines with high metastatic potential,
MAT-LyLu and AT-3, show loss of Tgfbr2 protein (19). In
mice, dominant negative Tgfbr2 mutant expression increased
metastasis in the prostate of the TRAMP model (34), and
conditional inactivation of Tgfbr2 in fibroblasts resulted in
intraepithelial neoplasia in the mouse prostate (35). In human
prostate cancers, impaired TGF-h signaling, for which TGFBR2 is
a key mediator, is likely to be deeply involved (12). Factors
supporting this include, first, that TGF-h functions as an inducer
of apoptosis in the normal prostate (12, 13); second, TGFBR2
expression is reduced or lost in prostate cancers (14–16), as
confirmed in this study; and third, overexpression of TGFBR2
restores sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to apoptosis (12, 17).
All these strongly indicate that Tgfbr2 silencing is causally
involved in rat prostate carcinogenesis, and suggest that TGFBR2
down-regulation could be causally involved in human prostate
carcinogenesis.
Human TGFBR2 silencing due to dense methylation of its
promoter region was first reported in lung cancer cell lines (29).
Here, we showed that a critical region for its silencing was
located just upstream of the human TGFBR2 multiple TSSs
(region 2, MSP-3), and that dense methylation of the region can
repress its transcription. However, in human primary prostate
cancers, TGFBR2 silencing by dense methylation was not
detected. The initial report on human TGFBR2 silencing did not
analyze primary cancers (29). These findings suggest that TGFBR2
methylation silencing is very rare in human primary cancers.
Methylation of a specific CpG site at 96 (nucleotide 140 in the
original report) was reported to correlate with reduced TGFBR2
expression in prostate cancer cell lines (36). However, we were
not able to observe the correlation between methylation of the
specific CpG site and transcription, or to detect dense
methylation in any regions around the TSSs (MSP primers 1–5;
Fig. 3A and C).
The rare occurrence of TGFBR2 methylation silencing in
human primary cancers was in sharp contrast with the frequent
occurrence of Tgfbr2 methylation silencing in rat invasive
prostate cancers. Methylation silencing of genes other than
TGFBR2 are frequently observed in human prostate cancers (37).
As a mechanism for the decreased TGFBR2 expression, we first
looked for TGFBR2 mutations, but could not observe any. Then
we analyzed transcriptional capacity and histone modifications,
and revealed the presence of contrastive mechanisms between
rats and humans. In the rat prostate cancer cell lines with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

Tgfbr2 methylation silencing (PLS20 and PLS30), Tgfbr2 expression levels were almost zero (Fig. 1D), their promoter regions
were densely methylated, and had histone modification
(H3K9me3) typical for inactive chromatin. In contrast, the human
prostate cancer cell lines with decreased TGFBR2 expression
(LNCaP and 22Rv1) had very low levels of expression (Fig. 5B),
decreased transcriptional capacity, and histone deacetylation and
H3K27 trimethylation (LNCaP). The relative location of a CGI
against the TSSs was markedly different between human and rat
sequences, the human CGI mainly in exon 1 and the rat CGI
mainly in the promoter region, and could be responsible for the
contrastive mechanisms for the decreased Tgfbr2 (TGFBR2)
expression.
The induction mechanism of rat Tgfbr2 silencing in the prostate
is an interesting issue. Androgen exposure, a critical promoting
factor of prostate cancers, is known to down-regulate Tgfbr2
expression at the transcriptional level (38, 39), and transcriptional
repression is known to trigger aberrant DNA methylation (3). In the
rat prostate cancer model used here, a combination of an androgen
(testosterone) and DMAB is important in inducing invasive
prostate cancers, and thus Tgfbr2 silencing. This suggests that
not only the reduced Tgfbr2 transcription but also some
abnormality, required for induction of Tgfbr2 silencing, is induced
by testosterone and DMAB.
As for other methylation-silenced genes in the PLS rat
prostate cancer cell lines, Aebp1 is a binding partner for
tumor-suppressor PTEN (40). Gas6 and Ocm have oncogenic
functions (41, 42). Nnat is known as an imprinting gene and its
aberrant hypermethylation occurs frequently in pediatric acute
leukemia (43). There is a possibility that silencing of these genes
is related to the development and progression of rat prostate
carcinoma. In human prostate cancers, two studies reported
genomic screening of methylation-silenced genes (44, 45). No
common genes were present between the genes identified in the
two studies and the eight genes identified here. However, if we
adopted a more relaxed criterion for screening of up-regulated
genes in this study, Tgfb3 (11-fold up-regulation in PLS10) was
commonly identified (45). Tgfb3 is also involved in TGF-h
signaling, and is a candidate for a gene commonly methylationsilenced in both rat and human prostate cancers. Considering
the number of methylation-silenced genes, it is likely that the
majority of the genes silenced in PLS cells do not have causal
roles in carcinogenesis.
In summary, we found Tgfbr2 silencing due to dense DNA
methylation of its promoter CGI in rat prostate cancers. This
will enable us to analyze mechanisms of how methylation
silencing is induced in vivo and identify factors that affect its
induction.
