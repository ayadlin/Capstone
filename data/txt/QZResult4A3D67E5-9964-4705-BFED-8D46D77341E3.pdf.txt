Abstract
Increased sialyltransferase (ST) activity promotes cancer cell metastasis, and overexpression of cell surface
sialic acid correlates with poor prognosis in cancer patients. To seek therapies targeting metastasis for cancer
treatment, we developed a novel ST inhibitor, Lith-O-Asp, and investigated its antimetastatic and antiangiogenic
effects and mechanisms. We found that cells treated with Lith-O-Asp showed a reduction of activity on various
ST enzymes by in vitro and cell-based activity analyses. Lith-O-Asp inhibited migration and invasion abilities in
various cancer cell lines and showed inhibitory effect on the angiogenic activity of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells. Indeed, Lith-O-Asp treatment consequently delayed cancer cell metastasis in experimental and
spontaneous metastasis assays in animal models. Importantly, Lith-O-Asp decreased the sialic acid modification
of integrin-b1 and inhibited the expression of phospho-FAK, phospho-paxillin, and the matrix metalloprotease
(MMP) 2 and MMP9. Lith-O-Asp attenuated the Rho GTPase activity leading to actin dynamic impairment. In
addition, 2DE-MS/MS and immunoblotting analyses showed that Lith-O-Asp altered the protein expression level
and phosphorylation status of various proteins involved in crucial metastasis and angiogenesis pathways such as
vimentin and ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor RNH1. Furthermore, Lith-O-Asp treatment significantly inhibited the invasive ability exerted by ectopic overexpression of various ST enzymes catalyzing a-2,6- or a-2,3sialylation. Our results provide compelling evidence that the potential pan-ST inhibitor, Lith-O-Asp, suppressed
cancer cell metastasis likely by inhibiting FAK/paxillin signaling and expressing antiangiogenesis factors. Lith-OAsp is worthy for further testing as a novel antimetastasis drug for cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 71(2); 473–83.

cell growth or killing tumor cells directly or indirectly; however, there are only a few drugs that specifically inhibit
metastasis of tumor cells (2). Although there are still questions
on mechanism of cancer cell metastasis, some clues pertaining to developing antimetastasis compounds for the treatment of cancer metastasis have been revealed (3). For
example, overexpression of sialyltransferase (ST) has been
reported to positively correlate with cancer metastasis and
poor prognosis (4). Sialyltransferases belong to the glycosyltransferase family (5), members of which localize at transGolgi apparatus and are responsible for specifically adding
mono- or polysialic acids at nonreducing termini of the
glycoproteins or glycolipids. Sialic acid–containing glycoconjugates are important in cellular functions (3). It is believed
that alteration in cell surface sialylated antigens changes many
cellular properties: for example, cell–cell adhesion, cell–extracellular matrix adhesion, immune defense, cell metastasis, and
invasion abilities (4, 6–9). Importantly, ST overexpression and
cell surface sialylated antigen overpresentation have been
reported to positively correlate with cancer metastasis and
poor prognosis in leukemia (4, 10), colon (11), breast (12, 13),
gastric (14, 15), bladder (16), and ovarian cancers (17).
In addition, ST6 b-galactosamide a-2,6-sialyltransferase I

(ST6Gal I) knockout mice enhance epithelial tumor differentiation through reduced focal adhesion signaling (18). Blockade of sialyl Lewis antigens by antibody treatment in vivo
shows the reduction of tumor burden and angiogenesis in
tumor nodules (19). Therefore, targeting of ST to inhibit
cancer cell metastasis could be applied to cancer therapy.
Soyasaponin I, which is a natural compound purified from
soybean (20), has been shown to be an ST3 b-galactoside a-2,3sialyltransferase I (ST3Gal I) inhibitor. It effectively inhibits
breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 and murine melanoma cell,
B16F10, from metastasis in vivo (21, 22). However, soyasaponin I
is difficult to be obtained in a large amount for cancer treatment. Therefore, we have developed a series of lithocholic acid
analogues derived from soyasaponin I by chemical synthesis in
high purity and good yield (23). One of our compounds named
AL10 has been found to be cell permeable and could effectively
attenuate a-2,3-sialylation on cell surface. AL10 suppresses
lung metastasis of A549 in tail-vein–injected animal model
(24). To further explore the cellular effects of these lithocholic
acid analogues, the present study used various cell models to
examine the cell surface sialylated antigen expression profile,
cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis inhibition of a lithocholic acid analogue named Lith-O-Asp. Western blot analyses
were conducted to identify the signaling pathways affected by
Lith-O-Asp revealed by 2DE-MS/MS proteomic assays. In addition, the antimetastasis effect of Lith-O-Asp was performed by
both spontaneous and experimental metastasis assays in animal models to test its antimetastasis effects in vivo.

Western blot, immunoprecipitation,
immunocytochemistry staining, and flow cytometry
analyses
All antibodies used and their experimental conditions are
provided in Supplementary Table S1.
Wound-healing assay
Cancer cells were treated with different concentration of
Lith-O-Asp or DMSO for 48 hours. A cell-free gap of 500 mm
was created after removing the Culture-Insert (Ibidi). The cells
that migrated into the wound area were calculated as follows:
500 mm – (5- to 12-hour area  500 mm)/0-hour area. Four
independent experiments were photographed and quantified
under a microscope.

Materials and Methods

Transwell invasion assay
Transwell insert (8-mm pore; Falcon, BD Biosciences) were
precoated with 20-mg Matrigel (BD Bioscience) in DMEM
medium. The cells were treated with different doses of
Lith-O-Asp or DMSO for 48 hours. After 2 hours of recovery
in medium with Lith-O-Asp, 5  105 cells were seeded onto
precoated transwell insert with serum-free medium containing Lith-O-Asp, and the fitted culture dishes filled with DMEM
containing 20% FBS and Lith-O-Asp. Invaded cells were fixed
and stained after 16 hours. Four random views were photographed and quantified under a microscope.

Cell line used and cell culture
Normal human lung epithelial cells, BES-6, and human lung
cancer cell lines, CL1-0, CL1-1, and CL1-5F4, were obtained
from Dr. P.C. Yang (Department of Internal Medicine, National
Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; ref. 25). The
human lung cancer cell lines, H1299 and A549, were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. Luciferase expressing murine breast cancer cell line, 4T1-Luc, was obtained
from Dr. M.L. Kuo (Institute of Toxicology, National Taiwan
University, Taipei, Taiwan). All cells were grown in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco)
and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere.

Tube formation assay
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were
propagated in endothelial growth medium 2 (EGM2) supplemented with 2% FBS. HUVECs (2  104) were seeded onto 48well culture dishes coated with Matrigel followed by treatment
with EGM2 containing DMSO or 1 to 10 mmol/L of Lith-O-Asp.
Peak tube formation was observed at 12 hours posttreatment,
and 4 random fields were observed under a microscope. The
length of tubes for each treatment was quantified using software developed by Dr. Y-N. Sun (Department of Computer
Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung
University, Tainan, Taiwan). This experiment was independently repeated 3 times.

Compounds used and in vitro activity assay
The synthesis, purification, and in vitro activity assay of ST
inhibitor, Lith-O-Asp, were done as previously described
(23). The enzymes analyzed included rat ST3Gal I (CalBiochem), rat ST3Gal III (CalBiochem), and human ST6Gal I
(CalBiochem). The modified disaccharides used as UVlabeled acceptors were Galb1,3GalNAca-PNP for ST3Gal I,
Galb1,4Glcb-4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl for ST3Gal III, and
Galb1,4GlcNAcb-4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl for ST6Gal I.

In vivo spontaneous metastasis assay
The BALB/c mice were acquired from the animal center of
the National Cheng-Kung University Medical College Laboratory Animal Center after obtaining appropriate institutional
review board permission and were raised in a specific pathogen-free environment. Highly metastatic murine 4T1-Luc
breast cancer cells (5  105) were subcutaneously injected
into the mammary fat pad of mice. Mice received 3 mg/kg of
Lith-O-Asp intraperitoneally on every other day. DMSO treatment was used as control. The growth and the spontaneous
metastasis of the tumors were observed under IVIS50 in vivo
imaging system (Xenogen) with endotoxin-free luciferase
substrate (VivoGlo, Promega) injection. The metastasized

Ectopic expression of sialyltransferases
Vectors including pCMV-SPORT6-ST3Gal I and pCMVSPORT6-ST6Gal I (both from Thermo Scientific) were used

for ectopic expression of ST3Gal I and ST6Gal I, respectively.
Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
The pCMV-SPORT6 empty plasmid was used as a control vector.

tumor tissues were dissected on day 26, and hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E)-stained for further pathologic confirmation.
In vivo experimental metastasis assay
The BALB/c mice were acquired and raised after obtaining
appropriate institutional review board permission as described
above. 4T1-Luc cells were treated with 10 mmol/L of Lith-O-Asp
or DMSO as control for 48 hours, and then trypsinized and
recovered for 2 hours in 20% FBS-containing media with
10 mmol/L of Lith-O-Asp or DMSO control. Cells (1  105
cells/200 mL) were subsequently resuspended in serum-free
medium, and intravenously injected into tail-vein of BALB/c
mice. These mice were then given luciferase substrate
(Promega) and photographed by IVIS50 in vivo imaging system
(Xenogen) at day 7 and day 9 for the observation of in vivo cancer
cell metastasis. The metastasized tumor nodules in lung tissue
were dissected and H&E-stained for further confirmation.

mRNA and protein of ST genes (ST3Gal I, ST3Gal III, ST3Gal IV,
and ST6Gal I) were expressed in lung cancer cells with higher
metastatic potential (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B), suggesting that overexpression of STs contributed to the metastatic
ability in the lung cancer cells, in addition to other cancer cells
reported (12, 13, 16). Interestingly, there was no significant
difference in mRNA expression level between untreated and
treated cells with various concentrations of Lith-O-Asp for 48
hours (Supplementary Fig. S1C), whereas Lith-O-Asp treatment decreased the ST3Gal I protein level by 20% to 25% in
H1299, CL1-5, and A549 cells as quantified by flow cytometry
(Supplementary Fig. S1D).
By in vitro activity assay, we revealed the ability of Lith-OAsp to inhibit the activities of ST3Gal I, ST3Gal III, and ST6Gal
I. The IC50 values ranged from 12 to 37 mmol/L (Fig. 1A). By
cell-based flow cytometric analysis, expression of a-2,3-sialylated antigens was found to be significantly inhibited after 48
hours of treatment with Lith-O-Asp detected using SLex and
SLea monoclonal antibodies to sialyl-Lewis antigens (Fig. 1B).
In addition, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
MAL and SNA were used as the biomarkers for recognition
of cell surface a-2,3- and a-2,6-sialylated antigens. Flow
cytometry showed a significant decrease in the expression of cell surface a-2,3- and a-2,6-sialylated antigens on

treatment with Lith-O-Asp in lung cancer cells (Fig. 1C and D).
The results indicated that Lith-O-Asp decreased the activity of
both a-2,3- and a-2,6-sialyltransferases, and thus inhibited the
transfer of sialic acids to the targeted glycoproteins.
To examine whether Lith-O-Asp could form stable structure
with mammalian ST, computational molecular docking was
conducted. The docking computation located the acid end of
Lith-O-Asp compound at the disaccharide-binding site and
the amine end leaning toward CMP. Major stabilizing forces of
ST were in close contact with acid end of Lith-O-Asp by Val318
and Tyr233, the nonpolar 4-ring segment of Lith-O-Asp was in
contact with hydrophobic micropocket of the enzyme, and the

476

amine end of Lith-O-Asp interacted with the polar environment (Supplementary Fig. S2). Lith-O-Asp also formed a
hydrogen bond with Tyr269 at its acid end, and Val318
may also contribute to the hydrophobic stabilization interaction. The predicted binding conformation supported that the
compound inhibits ST activity.

Lith-O-Asp at such doses did not affect cell proliferation
(Supplementary Fig. S3), so its anticancer metastasis effects
can be further studied unambiguously at noncytotoxic doses.
The results showed that the noncytotoxic Lith-O-Asp treatment significantly decreased cell migration in 5 to 12 hours
during wound-healing assay of various cancer cell lines
(Fig. 2A).
Matrigel-coated transwell was used to test the invasion
inhibition of Lith-O-Asp. Cells were pretreated with 10 or 30

performed to investigate the antimetastasis ability of LithO-Asp. Murine 4T1-Luc mammary adenoma cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of the BALB/c
mice. Mice received 3 mg/kg of Lith-O-Asp intraperitoneally
on every other day starting from day 1. DMSO was used as
solvent control. A significant amount of secondary metastatic
cancer cells were observed in lung tissues of DMSO control
mice detected using IVIS in vivo imaging system after 26 days
of fat pad inoculation. However, Lith-O-Asp–treated mice
showed fewer lung metastases (Fig. 3A). Reduction of metastasized cancer mass and number of tumor nodules in lung
tissues was further confirmed by H&E staining (Fig. 3B). All
DMSO-treated mice confirmed secondary lung metastasis, but
only 3 of 8 Lith-O-Asp–treated mice showed lung metastasis.

bearing Lith-O-Asp–treated cancer cells also showed more
tumor nodules in the lungs (Fig. 3D).
Lith-O-Asp participates in antiangiogenesis progression
It had been reported that SLex and SLea antibodies treatment inhibits tube formation in vitro and tumor angiogenesis
in vivo (19). To get insight into the role of Lith-O-Asp in
angiogenesis, tube formation assay of HUVEC was performed.
The results showed that Lith-O-Asp significantly inhibited
tube formation ability of HUVEC on treatment with 5 to 10
mmol/L of Lith-O-Asp(Fig. 4A and B). Two angiogenic inhibitors, ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor (RNH1) and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), were found to be upregulated after
Lith-O-Asp treatment (Fig. 4C).

Lith-O-Asp decreases cell migration ability through
inhibition of integrin sialylation and FAK/paxillin
signaling pathway
Recent reports have shown evidence that the clustering of
monosialyl-glycosphingolipid initiates focal adhesion kinase
(FAK)/paxillin/Rac/MMP downstream signaling pathway and
activates cell invasion ability (27, 28). In addition, Lith-O-Asp
inhibited the sialylation of integrin-b1 (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Therefore, we investigated whether the decreased
migration ability of cells treated with Lith-O-Asp resulted from
inhibition of integrin/FAK/paxillin signaling pathway and its
downstream effectors. The results demonstrated that after 10
or 30 mmol/L of Lith-O-Asp treatment for 48 hours, the active
forms of FAK (p-FAK/Y397) and paxillin (p-paxillin/Y31) were
decreased, whereas there was no change in the expression of
total FAK and paxillin proteins. The downstream matrix
metalloprotease (MMP) 2 and MMP9 were consistently
decreased in a dose-dependent manner after Lith-O-Asp
treatment (Fig. 5A). The FAK downstream small GTPase,
Rho, which acts as an actin modulator in cell motility, also
showed a dose-dependent decrease of activity after Lith-OAsp treatment (Fig. 5B) along with the loss of actin stress
fibers in Lith-O-Asp–treated cells (Fig. 5C).
Lith-O-Asp takes part in cancer metastasis suppression
in multiple ways revealed by proteomic studies
To identify whether there were other differentially
expressed proteins and proteins with altered phosphorylation
status influenced by Lith-O-Asp, in addition to FAK/paxillin/
Rac/MMP signaling proteins, 2D-MS/MS proteomic analyses
were performed. CyproRuby stain and Pro-Q Diamond PhosphoProtein gel stain were used for total protein and phosphoprotein staining, respectively, from whole-cell lysates of
CL1-5 lung cancer cell, followed by in-gel digestion and MS/
MS analysis (Supplementary Fig. S6). The proteins showing
significant difference in expression or phosphorylation status are listed in Table 1. The results indicated that after LithO-Asp treatment, decreased expression at total protein level
of tumor necrosis receptor–associated protein 1 (TRAP1),
WD-repeated protein 1 (WDR1), and chaperonin containing
TCP1 subunit 6A isoform a (CCT6A) was observed; whereas,
the total protein levels of the RNH1, PGK1, and cofilin 1
(CFL1) were increased. In phosphoprotein-staining gels,
Ran-GTPase activating protein 1 (RANGAP1), vimentin, heat
shock protein b1 (HSPb1), and b-galactoside a-2,3-sialyltransferase 4 (ST3Gal IV) increased in their phosphorylation
statuses after Lith-O-Asp treatment. To confirm the Lith-OAsp–affected proteins identified by 2DE-MS/MS, the expression levels of RNH1, PGK1, WDR1, CCT6A1, and cofilin
proteins were detected by Western blot (Figs. 4C and 5A).
The phosphorylation status of vimentin and ST3Gal IV
proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation (IP)-Western assay (Fig. 5D).
Reduction of metastasis by Lith-O-Asp is mediated
through inhibition of sialyltransferases

invasion assay was performed on cells ectopically overexpressing ST3Gal I or ST6Gal I with 30 mmol/L of Lith-O-Asp
treatment. The results showed that Lith-O-Asp treatment
significantly inhibited the invasive ability exerted by ectopically overexpressed ST3Gal I or ST6Gal I (Fig. 6). In addition,
inhibition of FAK activity and transwell invasion ability were
similar in ST3Gal I or ST6Gal I knocked down and Lith-O-Asp–
treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). These results demonstrated a causal relationship between blockade of ST activity
and altered cell behavior by Lith-O-Asp.

Discussion
Metastasis is the major cause of death in cancer patients.
However, effective antimetastasis compounds for cancer
treatment remain to be developed. In this study, we provide
compelling evidence from cell and animal studies that LithO-Asp, a potential pan-ST inhibitor (Fig. 1), is an antimetastasis compound. Lith-O-Asp repressed cell migration in
various cancer cell lines (Fig. 2) and inhibited the angiogenic
activity of HUVECs (Fig. 4). The results of in vivo spontaneous and experimental metastasis assays further confirmed
that Lith-O-Asp suppressed tumor metastasis likely through
inhibition of migration, invasion, and colonization during
early and late stages of cancer progression (Fig. 3). Lith-OAsp inhibited sialylation of integrin-b1 and FAK/paxillin/
Rho/MMP signaling pathway (Fig. 5 and Supplementary
Fig. S5). In addition, Lith-O-Asp altered the protein expression levels and phosphorylation statuses of various proteins
involved in crucial metastasis and angiogenesis pathways
such as vimentin and RNH1 (Table 1). These results suggested that Lith-O-Asp may be a promising lead compound
for antimetastatic treatment.

Our data showed that Lith-O-Asp inhibited the metastasis
potential of cancer cell through inhibiting both a-2,6- and
a-2,3-sialylations (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, the immunocytochemistry staining and IP-Western blot further confirmed
the correlation between decrease of a-2,6 and a-2,3-sialylation
of integrin-b1 after Lith-O-Asp treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Importantly, Lith-O-Asp treatment significantly inhibited the invasive ability exerted by ectopically overexpressed
ST3Gal I or ST6Gal I (Fig. 6). Furthermore, siRNA knockdown
of ST3Gal I or ST6Gal I caused inhibition in FAK signaling and
impeded the invasive ability of A549 lung cancer cells, similar
to what was observed on Lith-O-Asp treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7). Collectively, these results demonstrated a causal
relationship between blockade of ST activity and invasion
inhibition of Lith-O-Asp.
Activated integrins control downstream signaling pathway
activation through non-receptor tyrosine kinase FAK (27, 29)
and correlate with cancer metastasis (28). Integrin-b1 has
been genomically identified and shown to clinically promote
cancer metastasis (26). In addition, the Rho/Rac/CDC42
small-G proteins, which are downstream effectors of FAK,
control cell motility through WASP (Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein) and actin-related protein (ARP) 2/3 complex
signaling pathway to regulate the extension and branching of
actin filament and cell protrusion (30). Importantly, the
integrin-b1 downstream signaling player, RhoA, is known to
regulate the actin stress fiber-coordinated fibronectin matrix
assembly (31), which is capable of promoting cancer metastasis in the lungs (32, 33). We confirmed that Lith-O-Asp
treatment decreased a-2,6- and a-2,3-sialylation of integrin-(1;
decreased p-FAK(Y31), p-paxillin(Y397), MMP2, MMP9 protein expression; and decreased Rho activity (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S5). Lith-O-Asp may inhibit cancer cell

motility partly through suppression of sialylation of integrin-b
and further attenuation of downstream FAK/paxillin/Rho/
MMP signaling pathway. Further studies on WASP and
ARP2/3 complex level upon Lith-O-Asp treatment are
under way.
Several differentially expressed proteins and proteins with
altered phosphorylation status induced by Lith-O-Asp were
revealed by 2DE-MS/MS assay (Table 1). For example, CCT6A,
which is a chaperonin and stimulates TGF-b-mediated migration and invasion through maturation of sphingosine kinases 1
(34), and WDR1, which is essential for actin dynamics through
interaction with cofilin (35), showed decreased expression
after Lith-O-Asp treatment. Interestingly, we observed an
increase in p-cofilin (Fig. 5A), which represents inhibition
of actin dynamics (36). Collectively, Lith-O-Asp may suppress
cell migration by inhibiting several pathways controlling
cytoskeleton dynamics. It has been shown that sialylation
of cell surface adhesion molecules correlates with cancer–
endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation, and angiogenesis (19,
37). We observed that RNH1, which inhibits in vivo angiogenesis and tumor growth through angiogenin inhibition (38) and
PGK1, which acts as endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor (39),
were overexpressed after Lith-O-Asp treatment. Lith-O-Asp
dose dependently inhibited tube formation of HUVEC cells,

www.aacrjournals.org

suggesting that Lith-O-Asp may participate in antiangiogenic
process through RNH1 and PGK1 expression (Fig. 4). Interestingly, phosphorylation of vimentin, which decelerates intermediate filament formation during epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (40; (Fig. 5D) and phosphorylation of HSPb1, which
mediates its antiadhesive activity through cytoskeleton
dynamic control (41), were increased after Lith-O-Asp treatment (Table 1). Our 2DE-MS/MS and IP-Western results
confirmed that a-2,3-ST isotype, ST3Gal IV, was phosphorylated after Lith-O-Asp treatment (Table 1 and Fig. 5D). ST3Gal
IV can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C leading to its
inactivation (42), and the protein kinase C can be activated by
secondary bile acids such as lithocholic acid (43). Whether our
lithocholic acid derivative, Lith-O-Asp, activates protein
kinase C needs further confirmation. Nevertheless, the proteins revealed by proteomic studies suggested that Lith-O-Asp
inhibited cancer cell migration/metastasis through impaired
angiogenesis and cytoskeleton responses in multiple ways.
Further protein–protein interaction analyses will be performed to dissect the mechanism in relation to pathways
affected by Lith-O-Asp.
We proposed that Lith-O-Asp inhibited tumor cell metastasis partly through inhibition of ST activity to attenuate
sialylation modification of cell surface proteins, such as

integrin-b1, thus inhibiting FAK/paxillin/Rho signaling
activity. Other signaling pathways such as cytoskeleton and
angiogenesis control may also be involved in Lith-O-Asp–
mediated cancer metastasis inhibition. In addition, 20% to
25% reduction of ST3Gal I protein level by Lith-O-Asp could be
rescued by chloroquine treatment, suggesting that Lith-O-Asp
induced ST3Gal I degradation through the lysosomal degradation system (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Therefore, the
metastasis inhibition effects of Lith-O-Asp may be partly
meditated through degradation of ST proteins. Collectively,
the potential pan-ST inhibitor, Lith-O-Asp, suppressed tumor
cell metastasis/colonization in vitro and in vivo. Our study
provided evidence for therapeutic intervention in cancer
metastasis by developing ST inhibitors.
