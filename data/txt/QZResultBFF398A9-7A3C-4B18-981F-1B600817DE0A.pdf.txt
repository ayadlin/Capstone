ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapeutic drugs is a formidable barrier
to the success of cancer chemotherapy. Expressions of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters contribute to clinical MDR phenotype. In this study, we found that
afatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting EGFR, HER-2 and
HER-4, reversed the chemoresistance mediated by ABCG2 in vitro, but had no effect
on that mediated by multidrug resistance protein ABCB1 and ABCC1. In addition,
afatinib, in combination with topotecan, significantly inhibited the growth of ABCG2overexpressing cell xenograft tumors in vivo. Mechanistic investigations exhibited
that afatinib significantly inhibited ATPase activity of ABCG2 and downregulated
expression level of ABCG2, which resulted in the suppression of efflux activity of
ABCG2 in parallel to the increase of intracellular accumulation of ABCG2 substrate
anticancer agents. Taken together, our findings may provide a new and useful
combinational therapeutic strategy of afatinib with chemotherapeutical drug for the
patients with ABCG2 overexpressing cancer cells.

a critical role in the resistance of CSCs [7, 8]. Inhibition
or down-regulation of ABCG2 may be a valid approach to
reverse ABCG2-mediated drug resistance and to improve
the clinical efficacy of cancer chemotherapy.
Generally, the more commonly adopted approach
to overcome MDR is to identify or develop effective
and safe inhibitors of ABC transporters. Compared with
other drug transporter inhibitors, a unique advantage
of specific ABCG2 inhibitors is the putative role in the
elimination of CSCs. Unfortunately, the majority of
tested MDR modulators are failed because of either
insufficient in efficacy or exhibiting unacceptable toxicity
or unpredictable pharmacokinetic interactions [9, 10].
Recently, it is reported that ABCG2 has a relatively high
affinity with some tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which
are designed to act by competing against ATP binding to
the intracellular catalytic domain of oncogenic tyrosine
kinases, thereby inhibiting cell growth. These TKIs, such
as lapatinib and imatinib, have been shown to modulate

INTRODUCTION
Intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance (MDR)
to chemotherapeutic drugs is a main obstacle for the
successful cancer chemotherapy. Intense research on the
mechanism of MDR has focused on the overexpression
of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters that function as active drug efflux pumps
resulting in the reduction of cellular accumulation of drugs
[1]. It is well established that ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein,
MDR1), ABCC1 (multidrug resistance associated
protein 1, MRP1) and ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance
protein, BCRP) are involved in the active extrusion
of anticancer drugs from cells [2]. There is emerging
evidence that the expression of ABCG2 is associated with
a poor clinical response to chemotherapy [3–6]. Of interest
is the observation that ABCG2 has been considered as a
determinant of side population (SP) cells which are highly
enriched in cancer stem cells (CSCs), and appears to play

ABC transporter activity and improve the efficacy of
anticancer drugs [11–14]. Accordingly, identifying an
effective TKI that can specifically inhibit or downregulate
ABCG2 would dramatically accelerate the development of
reversal agents for circumventing ABCG2-mediated MDR
in cancer chemotherapy.
Afatinib (BIBW 2992), an ATP-competitive anilinequinazoline compound with a reactive acrylamide group,
is an orally administered irreversible inhibitor of both
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human
epidermal receptor 2 (HER2) tyrosine kinases. In June
2013, based on the good results of clinical trials, afatinib
was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for first-line treatment of patients with EGFRmutated non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Afatinib
is also under development in several other solid tumors
including breast and head and neck cancer [15–17]. In this
study, we showed that afatinib exerted inhibitory effects
on ABCG2 function via dual mechanisms, competitive
block of substrate transport and downregulation of
ABCG2 expression, thereby reversing ABCG2-mediated
drug resistance in various cancer cells with ABCG2
overexpression in vitro and in vivo.

Afatinib reversed the resistance of ABCG2overexpressing cells to chemotherapeutic
agents in vitro
ABC transporters, especially ABCB1, ABCC1 and
ABCG2, have been indicated to contribute significantly to
MDR. To investigate whether afatinib could potentiate the
efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents in various resistant
cells, MTT assay was first used to detect the cytotoxicity
of afatinib alone. As shown in Fig. 1(A-E), there was a
significant difference in the susceptibility of various
cells to afatinib alone. The IC50 values were 3.68 ± 0.09,
4.12 ± 0.06, 3.03 ± 0.06, 3.71 ± 0 .13, 7.93 ± 0.12, 1.42 ±
0.10, 1.21 ± 0.09, 3.48 ± 0.28, 4.17 ± 1.48, 1.55 ± 0.38,
5.44 ± 0.14 for H460, H460/MX20, HEK293, HEK293/
ABCG2-G482-R2, HEK293/ABCG2-G482-T7, HL60,
HL60/ADR, MCF7, MCF7/ADR, KB and KBv200 cells,
respectively. Accordingly, afatinib at concentrations
of 0.1 and 1.0  μM, respectively, was selected as the
maximum working concentration for further reversal
assay in different cancer cells. Based on this, IC50 values

of various drugs in different sensitive cells and in their
resistant counterparts with or without the concomitant
treatment with different concentrations of afatinib
were shown in Table 1. The ABCG2-overexpressing
cells showed significant resistant phenotype to ABCG2
substrates topotecan and mitoxantrone. Afatinib at
1.0 μmol/L significantly increased mitoxantrone-induced
cytotoxicity in both the parental H460 cells and the
ABCG2-overexpressing H460/MX20 cells. In addition,
afatinib remarkably potentiated the efficacy of topotecan
and mitoxantrone in the ABCG2-overexpressing S1-MI-80
cells, but not in the parental S1 cells which did not express
ABCG2. In the presence of 1.0  μmol/L afatinib, IC50
values of topotecan and mitoxantrone were dramatically
decreased from 7.59 ± 0.95 to 0.45 ± 0.25 μmol/L and
from 15.66 ± 0.98 to 1.37 ± 0.13 μmol/L in S1-MI-80 cells,

respectively (Table 1). In contrast, afatinib at 1.0 μmol/L
did not significantly alter the IC50 values of cisplatin
which is not a substrate of ABCG2, in all tested cells.
These results indicated that afatinib could reverse the
resistance mediated by ABCG2.
The effect of afatinib on the ABCB1 and ABCC1
transporters was also determined by MTT assay. It was
found that afatinib did not enhance the cytotoxicity
of doxorubicin, which is a known substrate for both
ABCB1 and ABCC1, in resistant KBv200, MCF7/ADR
and HL60/ADR cells that express ABCB1, ABCB1 and
ABCC1, respectively, suggesting that afatinib probably
did not interact with ABCB1 and ABCC1.
It has been reported that mutations in ABCG2
protein at amino acid 482 may alter the substrate specificity
and undermine the effectiveness of ABCG2 inhibitor [18].

Cell survival was determined by MTT assay as described in Materials and Methods. The fold reversal of MDR (values
given in parentheses) was calculated by dividing the IC50 for cells with anticancer drugs in the absence of afatinib by
that obtained in the presence of afatinib. Data represent Mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments. *p < 0.05,

Therefore, the potentiation of cytotoxicity of ABCG2
substrate drugs by afatinib was also investigated in
HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild-type (482R2) or
mutant (482T7) ABCG2. These ABCG2-stably transfected
HKE293 cells exhibited moderate levels of resistance to
ABCG2 substrates (topotecan or mitoxantrone) compared
with cells transfected with a control vector (Table 2).
In HEK293 cells transfected with wild type ABCG2

activity of topotecan or mitoxantrone was not altered in
the control vector-transfected HEK293 with or without the
concomitant treatment of afatinib.
Taken together, these results indicated that
afatinib sensitized ABCG2-overexpressing cells to
chemotherapeutic agents in vitro.

Furthermore, we used these xenograft tumors to
test the effect of afatinib on ABCG2 expression in vivo
by performing ABCG2 immunohistochemical staining.
H460/MX20 xenograft tumors exhibited an intense
positive staining for ABCG2 on the cell surface (Fig. 2E).
Xenograft tumors of saline control group showed higher
ABCG2 staining compared with tumors that treated with
afatinib alone or combination with topotecan (Fig. 2F).
These findings suggest that the enhanced anticancer
activity of topotecan by afatinib in vivo might be due to
impaired ABCG2 expression.

Afatinib significantly potentiated the anticancer
activity of topotecan in vivo
H460/MX20 cell xenograft tumor model was
established to investigate the sensitizing effect of afatinib
in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2(A-B), neither afatinib nor
topotecan alone produced significant antitumor effect.
In contrast, afatinib in combination with topotecan
significantly decreased the sizes, weights and volumes
of xenograft tumors, compared with saline, afatinib or
topotecan alone. The mean weights of tumors excised from
mice were 0.86 ± 0.23, 0.67 ± 0.17, 0.62 ± 0.31, 0.34 ±
0.12g for saline, afatinib, topotecan and combination
groups, respectively (Fig. 2C). And the inhibition rate (IR)
of the combination group was up to 60.43 %. Throughout
the in vivo study, afatinib alone or combination group did
not produce visible weight loss or treatment-related deaths
in the athymic nude mice (Fig. 2D). These results indicated
that the antitumor ability of topotecan was significantly
enhanced when it was administrated in combination with
afatinib in the tumors that expressed ABCG2.

Afatinib inhibited efflux activity of ABCG2
The potentiation of anticancer activity by transporter
inhibitors is usually mediated by the inhibition of
transporter-mediated efflux, thereby leading to an increase
in the intracellular drug accumulation [19]. To explore the
potential mechanism by which afatinib sensitizes ABCG2overexpressing cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, we
examined the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin
(Dox) and Rho 123, known fluorescent substrates of
ABCG2, by flow cytometry in S1-MI-80 cells. As shown
in Fig. 3(A-B), the intracellular concentrations of Dox and
Rho 123 in S1-MI-80 cells were significantly lower than
that in their parental S1 cells in the absence of afatinib.
But in the presence of 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 μmol/L afatinib,
the fluorescence index of Dox in S1-MI-80 cells was

elevated by 2.2-, 3.0-, 3.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 3C).
The intracellular accumulation of Rho123 was increased
by 1.7-, 2.2- and 4.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 3D).
These results suggest that afatinib, similar to a potent
ABCG2-specific inhibitor FTC, dramatically increased
the accumulation of Dox and Rho 123 in a concentrationdependent manner in S1-MI-80 cells (Fig. 3). However,
neither afatinib nor FTC affected the intracellular levels
of Dox and Rho123 in S1 cells.
In addition, the competition between afatinib and a
fluorescent ABCG2 probe substrate (pheophorbide A, PhA)
for efflux was studied in HEK293/ABCG2 cells by flow

cytometry analysis. The read-out of the assay is the retention
of the fluorescent ABCG2 substrate (PhA) after a 1-h
drug-free efflux. Inhibition of ABCG2-mediated efflux is
indicated by a shift to higher intracellular fluorescent signal.
As illustrated in Fig. 4(A-B), afatinib was found to inhibit
the efflux of PhA in a concentration-dependent manner.
Compared with another specific and potent ABCG2 inhibitor
Ko143, afatinib at a concentration of 2 μM exhibited similar
inhibitory effect on ABCG2-mediated efflux as 200 nM
Ko143. The inhibition may be specific because intracellular
fluorescence in the backbone vector-transfected HEK293/
pcDNA3 cells was not affected by afatinib (Fig. 4A-B).

Increased 5D3 labeling by afatinib suggest its
interaction with ABCG2

(a known ABCG2 substrate) was found to increase only
slightly the 5D3 shift (~20% that of Ko143) whereas
cisplatin (a non-ABCG2 substrate) did not appreciably
affect 5D3 labeling.

5D3 is a conformation sensitive monoclonal
antibody recognizing an extacellular epitope of the
human ABCG2. 5D3 binding to ABCG2 was known to
be increased in certain conformations of the transporter
protein upon substrate/inhibitor binding and ATP
hydrolysis (i.e. 5D3 shift) [20]. The 5D3 shift assay
was therefore performed in HEK293 ABCG2 cells to
demonstrate the interaction of afatinib with ABCG2.
Using the specific ABCG2 inhibitor (Ko143, 1 μM)
as the positive control (set as 100% 5D3 labeling for
comparison) (Fig. 5A), afatinib (1 μM) was found to
produce a remarkable 5D3 shift close to the level attained
by Ko143, thus suggesting the interaction between
afatinib and ABCG2. Other known ABCG2 inhibitors
(including FTC, tariquidar and erlotinib) tested were also
shown to notably increase 5D3 labeling relative to the
untreated control (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, quercetin

ATPase activity of ABCG2 was inhibited by
afatinib in a dose dependent manner
Drug efflux function of ABCG2 is associated
with ATP hydrolysis that is modulated in the presence
of its substrates or inhibitors. To further understand the
mechanism of ABCG2 inhibition by afatinib, the ATPase
activity of ABCG2 was measured in the presence of a
range of concentrations of afatinib. Sodium orthovanadate
was used in this experiment to suppress other major
membrane ATPases during the measurement. Similar
to the specific ABCG2 inhibitor (Ko143), afatinib was
found to inhibit the ATPase activity of ABCG2 in a dose
dependent manner, albeit its inhibitory effect was less
potent than that of Ko143 (Fig. 6).

blot. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (C-D) relative quantification of the effect of afatinib on ABCG2. ABCG2 protein expression

Afatinib downregulated ABCG2 expression

levels of ABCG2 were found to decrease after exposure
to afatinib in H460/MX20 cells, thus confirming the
immunohistochemical staining results that afatinib
reduced ABCG2 expression (Fig. 7C-D). Furthermore, in
the presence of afatinib, the alteration of ABCG2 mRNA
expression level was consistent with that of protein level,
suggesting that afatinib probably downregulate ABCG2
expression at the transcriptional level (Fig. 7E).
All these findings showed that the downregulation
of ABCG2 may contribute to the sensitizing effect by
afatinib in the ABCG2-overexpressing cells.

To evaluate the effect of afatinib on the expression
of the drug transporter ABCG2, we determined the
expression of ABCG2 at protein and mRNA level in
H460/MX20 cells after exposure to varying concentrations
of afatinib. It was found that afatinib reduced ABCG2
protein level although the reduction was not significant
at relatively low concentrations (Fig. 7A-B). To further
determine this, we incubated the cells with 1.0 μM
afatinib for 0, 24, 48, 72 h, respectively. The expression

DISCUSSION

that afatinib could act as a potent inhibitor of ABCG2 to
reverse the multidrug resistance medicated by ABCG2 in
vitro and in vivo.
The 5D3 shift assay suggested the interaction of
afatinib with ABCG2. Drug accumulation and efflux assay
by flow cytometry revealed that afatinib inhibited the
efflux capacity of ABCG2 in a dose-dependent manner.
Therefore, the ability of afatinib to reverse MDR mediated
by ABCG2 may be explained by its inhibitory effect on
the efflux of ABCG2. Drug efflux function of ABCG2
is associated with ATP hydrolysis that is modulated in
the presence of its substrates or inhibitors. To further
understand the mechanism underlying ABCG2 inhibition
by afatinib, the ATPase activity and expression level
of ABCG2 was measured in the presence of a range of
concentrations of afatinib. Notably, afatinib was found to
inhibit the ATPase activity of ABCG2 in a dose dependent
manner. Moreover, afatinib partially suppressed the
expression of ABCG2 at both the protein and mRNA
level at the relatively high concentrations. Thus, afatinib
probably exerted inhibitory effects on ABCG2 via dual
mechanisms, competitive block of substrate transport and
downregulation of ABCG2 expression. Further studies are
still needed to elucidate the exact mechanism underlying
the effect of afatinib on ABCG2 expression.
Recently, ABCG2 has been proposed to be a
promising biomarker for the identification and a new
therapeutic target for the eradication of CSCs [30]. Also,
ABCG2 is responsible for the “side population” (SP)
phenotype, which is often used for the identification
and isolation of CSCs. Currently, conventional
chemotherapeutic agents kill primarily the highly
proliferative tumor cells. The CSCs are spared by their
high expression of multidrug transporters (especially,
ABCG2), mediating their chemoresistance, and eventually
lead to tumor relapse and metastasis. Completely
eliminating cancer stem cells by overcoming the resistance
to chemotherapy mediated by ABCG2 would be a new
therapeutic target. Although it has been reported that
various TKIs including the reversible EGFR inhibitors
gefitinib and erlotinib could inhibit ABCG2, the inhibitory
effect was generally achieved by directly blocking the drug
efflux activity of ABCG2, with no change in its expression.
In contrast, in this study, we showed that afatinib could
reverse the drug resistance and enhance the cytotoxicity of
conventional anticancer drugs in ABCG2-overexpressing
cancer cells by a dual inhibition of ABCG2. In addition to
its ability to inhibit ABCG2 activity, afatinib also reduced
the expression of ABCG2, albeit relatively moderate. This
mode of action of afatinib on ABCG2 made it distinctive
from other TKIs and clearly increased the potency of
afatinib on ABCG2. Importantly, ABCG2 has been
reported to be a predictor of shorter survival in cancer
patients, which implied that inhibiting ABCG2 might
contribute to increased response and prolonged survival

Multidrug resistance (MDR) of tumor cells to
chemotherapeutic agents is known to be the main cause
for treatment failure in cancer chemotherapy. Energydependent efflux of chemotherapeutics by several ABC
transporters, mainly by ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2,
has been reported as important contributing factor to the
development of MDR [21, 22]. Current strategies against
MDR are intended to reverse or prevent resistance of
cancer cells, by administering a transporter inhibitor at the
beginning of chemotherapy or using anticancer drugs that
are not substrates of drug transporters. Besides, a newly
proposed strategy for treating drug resistant cancers is to
exploit the resistance of cancer cells, which was achieved
by administrating at least two agents in sequence to
selectively protect non-resistant cells with killing of drugresistant cancer cells [23–25]. More recently, one potential
finding is that the combination of TKIs and cytotoxic
anticancer drugs is likely to have an additional beneficial
effect [13, 26, 27]. A hot area of translational research that
requires more in vivo studies is the use of TKIs as agents
that can potentially modify the functional activity of ABC
transporters [12, 28]. Therefore, TKIs can be exploited
to overcome resistance by increasing the intracellular
concentration of P-gp and/or ABCG2 substrate anticancer
drugs in cancer cells, tissues or tumors that express high
levels of these transporters [29].
Afatinib, a new FDA-approved TKI, is well known
for its effectiveness against advanced or metastasis
non-small cell lung cancer with mutant EGFR. We
hypothesized that afatinib can effectively compete with
chemotherapeutic agents for binding with ABCB1,
ABCC1, or ABCG2 and thus increase drug concentrations
in resistant cancer cells. But in this study, one potential
finding is that afatinib could increase the sensitivity of
ABCG2-overexpressing cells to chemotherapeutic agents
which are substrates of ABCG2 in a dose-dependent
manner, but did not potentiate the cytotoxicity of cisplatin,
a drug that is not the substrate for ABCG2 transporter.
In addition, in various sensitive parental cell lines,
there was no additive or synergetic antitumor effect. In
contrast, in resistant cancer cells with ABCB1/ABCC1
overexpression, afatinib can not enhance the cytotoxicity
of doxorubicin, a substrate drug for both ABCB1 and
ABCC1, suggesting that afatinib probably did not interact
with ABCB1 or ABCC1. Under all the experimental
concentrations, afatinib itself had no cytotoxic effect on
the cancer cells. Based on our in vitro study, the antitumor
effect of combination of afatinib with topotecan was also
demonstrated in a H460/MX20 cell xenograft model.
The results indicated that combination of afatinib with
topotecan exerted a better antitumor efficacy. Compared
with saline group, the inhibition rate of the combination
group was elevated by 60.43%. All these data indicated

rates [31]. Icotinib, a new small- molecule inhibitor of
EGFR tyrosine kinase, has been showed to interact with
ABCG2 transporter and reverse ABCG2-mediated MDR
by antagonizing the drug efflux function of ABCG2, with
no effect on ABCG2 expression [32]. It is unknown what
fundamental differences between afatinib and other TKIs
such as icotinib cause the difference in their mechanism
of action on ABCG2, which need to be evaluated in future
in-depth studies. Regardless, this study suggested that
afatinib may be a better candidate of ABCG2 inhibitor.
Combined chemotherapy of afatinib with topotecan may
provide a more effective way of sensitizing ABCG2mediated MDR and probably eliminating CSCs.
In summary, this study showed that afatinib could
reverse the drug resistance and enhance the cytotoxicity of
conventional anticancer drugs in ABCG2-overexpressing
cancer cells by a dual inhibition of ABCG2: inhibiting the
drug transport function and downregulating the expression
of ABCG2. These findings suggest that afatinib may be a
good candidate of ABCG2 inhibitors, and could be used
for combined chemotherapy with conventional anticancer
drugs to achieve a better therapeutic effect, which merits
further clinical investigation.

its vincristine-selected derivative ABCB1-overexpressing
cell line KBv200 were generous gifts from Dr. Xu-Yi Liu
(Cancer Hospital of Beijing, Beijing, China). All cell lines
were cultured in RPMI1640/DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL
streptomycin at 37°C in 5% (v/v) CO2.

Cytotoxicity assay
Cytotoxicity was determined using MTT assay
as follows. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at the
appropriate density. After plating for 24 h, cells were treated
with increasing concentrations of afatinib for another
68 h at 37°C. Then, MTT (5 mg/mL) was added into the
cells and incubated for another 4 h. Then the medium was
removed followed by adding 200 μL of dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO). Cytotoxicity was assessed by use of the Model
550 Microplate Reader (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA).
Both the fitted sigmoidal dose response curve and IC50 were
calculated by use of the Bliss method [33].
The reversal experiments in vitro were carried out
as previously described [34]. The fold of resistance was
calculated by dividing the IC50 for the MDR cells by that
for the parental sensitive cells. The degree of reversal of
MDR (fold reversal) was calculated by dividing the IC50
for cells with the anticancer drug in the absence of afatinib
by that obtained in the presence of afatinib.

Animal experiments
In vivo experiments were done in accordance
with the guidelines for the use of laboratory animals of
the Sun Yat-Sen University Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. H460/MX20 cells (3 × 106) were
subcutaneously injected into the right flank of athymic
nude mice (BALB/c-nu/nu, both sexes, 5 to 6 weeks
old). When xenograft size reached 5 mm in diameter,
mice were randomized into four groups (12 in each
group), and then received various treatments: (a) saline
(every 3 d × 6, intraperitoneally [IP]); (b) topotecan
(every 3 d × 6, IP, 3 mg/kg); (c) afatinib (every 3 d × 6,
orally [PO], 20 mg/kg); (d) topotecan (every 3 d × 6, IP,
3 mg/kg) plus afatinib (every 3 d × 6, PO, 20 mg/kg)
(afatinib was given 1 h before topotecan administration).
Tumor size was measured with linear calipers every
3 days. Tumor volumes (V) were calculated using the
formula: (length×width2/2). The mice were euthanized on
day 30 and the xenografts were excised and weighed. The
ratio of growth inhibition (IR) was estimated according to
the following formula:

described previously [37]. Cells were preincubated with
afatinib in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/Dulbecco’s PBS
for 10 min at 37°C before labeling with 0.5μg/mL of
either phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-ABCG2 antibody
5D3 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) or the phycoerythrinconjugated mouse IgG2b control antibody (eBioscience)
for another 45 min at 37°C. The tested compounds were
present during the antibody labeling. As positive control
for maximum labeling, 5D3 binding was determined in
the presence of 1μM Ko143 (a known specific ABCG2
inhibitor). Samples were analyzed on a LSRFortessa Cell
Analyzer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Fluorescence
was detected with a 488-nm argon laser and a 575-nm
bandpass filter. At least 10,000 events were collected for
all flow cytometry studies. All assays were performed in
three independent experiments.

The intracellular accumulation assay of Dox and
rhodamine123 was performed as previously described
with minor modifications [35]. Briefly, cells in culture
were preincubated with various concentrations of afatinib,
FTC (as a positive control inhibitor of ABCG2) or vehicle
control for 3h at 37°C, followed by addition of 10μmol/L
Dox or 5 μmol/L rhodamine123 and incubation for an
additional 3 h or 0.5 h, respectively. The cells were then
collected, centrifuged and washed three times with icecold PBS. Finally, the cells were analyzed with flow
cytometry (Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter). Dox and
rhodamine123 fluorescence were detected with a 488-nm
argon laser, and a 515-nm bandpass filter and a 575-nm
bandpass filter, respectively.

Flow cytometry-based ABCG2 substrate
efflux assay

ABCG2 ATPase assay
The vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity of ABCG2
was determined as previously described with minor
modifications. Crude membranes isolated from ABCG2expressing high five insect cells was kindly provided by
Dr. Suresh Ambudkar (National Cancer Institute, NIH,
USA). Briefly, afatinib (0.02–10 μM) or Ko143 (control
specific ABCG2 inhibitor; 0.002–1 μM) were allowed to
incubate with the crude membrane (100 μg/mL protein) in
the presence or absence of 1.2 mM sodium orthovanadate
in an ATPase assay buffer (50 mM KCl, 5 mM sodium
azide, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 6.8)
for 5 min at 37°C. The ATP hydrolysis reaction was then
started by the addition of 5 mM ATP and it was allowed
to proceed at 37°C for 40 min. After the incubation, SDS
solution (0.1 mL of 5% SDS) was used to terminate
the reaction. The liberation of inorganic phosphate was
quantified by comparing the absorbance to a phosphate
standard curve in a colorimetric assay [38].

A flow cytometry-based assay was employed to
study the inhibition of ABCG2 transport function by
afatinib as described previously [36]. Briefly, HEK293
cells stably transfected with ABCG2 or the backbone
vector pcDNA3 (i.e. HEK293/ ABCG2 and pcDNA3,
respectively) were trypsinized and incubated for
30 min in phenol red-free complete medium with 1 μM
pheophorbide A (PhA) in the presence or absence of a
range of different concentrations of afatinib. Subsequently,
the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and
incubated in PhA-free medium for 1 h at 37°C continuing
with the tested inhibitor to generate the inhibitor/efflux
histogram, or without the inhibitor to generate the efflux
histogram. The inhibited efflux was determined as the
difference in mean fluorescence value. To determine
significant difference between intracellular fluorescence
values, the Student’s t-test was performed with p < 0.05
being considered significant. Cells were finally washed
with cold Dulbecco’s PBS and placed on ice in the
dark until analysis by flow cytometry. Ko143, a specific
ABCG2 inhibitor, was used as the control for comparison.
Samples were analyzed on a LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). PhA fluorescence
was detected with a 488-nm argon laser and a 670-nm
bandpass filter. At least 10,000 events were collected for
all flow cytometry studies. Cell debris was eliminated by
gating on forward versus side scatter and dead cells were
excluded based on propidium iodide staining. All assays
were performed in three independent experiments

Immunohistochemical staining
The paraffin-embedded xenograft tumor tissue
blocks were sectioned in 4 mm slices and placed on Anti
slides. After de-waxing and hydration, the slides were
rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked
for 10 min with 3% hydrogen peroxide to deprive the
endogenous peroxidase activity. After antigen retrieval
with the use of a microwave, the specimens were incubated
with the anti ABCG2 mAb (diluted 1:1000 in PBS)
overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS, the sections
were incubated with the secondary antibodies followed
by fast staining with diaminobenzidine (DAB) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Dako Envision + Dual
Link System-HRP detection kit). In negative controls, the
primary antibody was replaced with PBS. The remaining
procedures were performed in parallel with other
specimens. Each slide was scored in a blinded fashion
