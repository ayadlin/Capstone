inhibition of Smo, which leads to activation of the Gli zinc-finger
transcription factors and transcriptional activation of downstream
Gli target genes including Gli1 and Ptch itself (1). Mutational
inactivation of Ptch results in a pathologic activation of the
signaling pathway and is characterized by increased levels of Gli1
and Ptch mRNA (reviewed in ref. 2).
Mutations in Ptch have been identified in a variety of tumors
including medulloblastoma (MB) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS;
ref. 3). Although Ptch is assumed to act as a tumor suppressor gene,
one normal allele is frequently retained in these tumors (4, 5).
Using Ptch neo67/ + mice, we recently showed that Ptch transcripts,
which are consistently overexpressed in tumors of these mice, are
derived predominantly from the mutated allele. In contrast, transcript levels of the other, mutation-free allele, seem to be unchanged
or down-regulated (5, 6). Several lines of evidence suggest that the
latter effect is mediated by the methylation of the wild-type Ptch
(wtPtch) allele: First, in breast carcinoma, PTCH expression is
reduced due to promoter methylation (7). Second, treatment with
the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine increased wtPtch mRNA
expression in cell lines derived from MB that arise in murine
Ptch neo12/ + heterozygotes (8). Third, we have recently shown that
methylation fully represses transcription from a Ptch promotor
construct (6) and fourth, PTCH promoter methylation has been
shown in Hh-dependent ovarian fibroma and dermoids (9),
although an analysis of the same region in Hh-associated MB
failed to detect any methylation changes compared with control
cerebella (10).
Changes in the DNA methylation status are among the most
common molecular alterations in human neoplasia (11). Best
characterized are increases in DNA methylation that are associated
with transcriptional silencing events particularly at promoter
regions of genes that regulate important cell functions, such as
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 and MLH1 (12). The
methylation of genomic DNA in malignant cells is catalyzed by
DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt; ref. 12). The role of Dnmt in
tumorigenesis has been impressively shown in heterozygous Dnmt1
mice, in which a 50% reduction of Dnmt1 expression was sufficient
to diminish tumor numbers induced by Apc or Mlh mutations,
or by carcinogens (13–15).
Inactivation of Dnmt leads to changes of histone modification
patterns including an increase in histone acetylation (16).
Therefore, a ‘‘cross talk’’ between DNA methylation and histone
deacetylation seems to work in concert to silence gene expression.
The importance of acetylation changes in Ptch-associated tumors
is unknown.

Abstract
Patched (Ptch) heterozygous mice develop medulloblastoma
(MB) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) resembling the
corresponding human tumors. We have previously shown that
epigenetic silencing of the intact Ptch allele contributes to
tumor formation in this model. Here, we investigated whether
targeting of epigenetic silencing mechanisms could be useful
in the treatment of Ptch-associated cancers. A reduction of
endogenous DNA methyltransferase1 (Dnmt1) activity significantly reduced tumor incidence in heterozygous Ptch
knockout mice. A combined treatment with the Dnmt
inhibitor 5-aza-2¶deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) and the histone
deacetlyase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) efficiently
prevented MB and RMS formation, whereas monotherapies
with either drug were less effective. Wild-type Ptch expression
was efficiently reactivated in tumors by 5-aza-dC/VPA
combination therapy. This was associated with reduced
methylation of the Ptch promoter and induction of histone
hyperacetylation suggesting inhibition of HDACs in vivo.
However, the treatment was not effective in clinically overt,
advanced stage tumors. This is a first in vivo demonstration
that targeting of Dnmt and HDAC activities is highly effective
in preventing formation of Ptch-associated tumors. The
results suggest a novel clinical strategy for consolidation therapy of corresponding tumors in humans after completion of conventional treatment. Our data also suggest that
epigenetic therapy may be less effective in treating advanced
stages of tumors, at least in this tumor model. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Ptch is a component of a signaling pathway, which plays a major
role in the control of cell differentiation and proliferation. Ptch
is the receptor for Hedgehog (Hh) and normally inhibits its
signaling partner Smoothened (Smo). Physiologic activation of the
pathway is induced by Hh. Binding of Hh to Ptch suspends the

observation, and at which overt clinical signs of toxicity were absent.
Toxicity was defined as loss of body weight of >10%, general weakness,
severe hair loss, or shaggy coat. In addition, blood cell counts were
measured before treatment, directly after treatment, and after the
observation period to detect delayed effects of the substances.
Treatment with 5-aza-dC was lethal for all mice at 1.6 mg/kg/d and for
1 mouse at 0.4 mg/kg/d, and was associated with severe reduction of leukocyte, erythrocyte, and platelet counts. Treatment with 0.1 mg/kg/d 5-azadC was well-tolerated and caused a moderate, reversible leukocytopenia.
Treatment with 640 mg/kg/d VPA was lethal for two mice and caused
pronounced somnolence as well as leukocytopenia in all mice. In contrast, all mice survived treatment with 400 mg/kg/d VPA and leukocyte
count normalized after discontinuation of therapy. Based on these data,
0.1 mg/kg/d 5-aza-dC and 400 mg/kg/d VPA were taken as the respective MTD.
For determination of the combined MTD (cMTD) and 1/2 cMTD, mice
were injected daily 0.1 mg/kg/d 5-aza combined with 400 mg/kg/d VPA, or
0.05 mg/kg/d 5-aza-dC combined with 200 mg/kg/d VPA, respectively. Each
drug was injected separately in a volume of 50 AL per injection to avoid
premature inactivation of 5-aza-dC due to its instability in solution.
All animals survived the 4-wk application period. A reversible
leukocytopenia under cMTD application was diagnosed in all animals.
Treatment of the B6 strain with the cMTD resulted in pronounced
somnolence, whereas the 1/2 cMTD was well-tolerated.
The cMTD (B6xBalb) and the 1/2 cMTD (B6) was also applied to
4-wk-old animals over a period of 12 wk. The reduction of blood cell count
was reversible. After therapy end, the animals were observed for additional
12 wk. There were no other signs of toxicity during the treatment and the
12-wk posttreatment observation period.
Based on these observations, a cMTD of 0.1 mg/kg/d 5-aza-dC and
400 mg/kg/d VPA was applied to B6xBalb, and a 1/2 cMTD of 0.05 mg/kg/d
5-aza-dC and 200 mg/kg/d VPA was applied to B6 mice in all combination treatments.
Therapeutic treatment of tumor-bearing Ptch neo67/ + mice with
5-aza-dC/VPA. RMS-bearing (B6xBalb)-Ptch neo67/ + mice were randomized
into two groups. After measurement of tumor size by volumetric computed
tomography (VCT), animals were treated daily with the cMTD or PBS i.p. for
30 d. When tumors grew too large or when animals showed a poor general
condition, they were euthanized and tumors were collected for molecular
analysis. If possible, tumor growth of the animals was measured by VCT
directly (d30) after treatment and once per month thereafter (d60, d90).
Chemopreventive treatment of Ptch neo67/ + mice with 5-aza-dC and/
or VPA. At ages 4 wk, (B6xBalb)-Ptch neo67/ + or B6-Ptch neo67/ + mice were
treated for 12 consecutive weeks with either the MTD of 5-aza, the MTD of
VPA, the cMTD of 5-aza-dC/VPA, or with vehicle. RMS development in
(B6xBalb)-Ptch neo67/ + mice was followed by regular manual palpations of
animals as most RMS develop in the muscles of the hip/thigh or intraabdominal. Animals were either euthanized immediately after the
treatment or at the age of f220 d.
Advanced stages of MB in B6-Ptch neo67/ + mice were diagnosed when the
animals showed ataxia, decrease in overall activity, rough hair, weight loss,
as well as signs of abnormal occipital prominence. To identify early stage
tumorigenic lesions, the cerebella were removed and subjected to
microscopic examination (see below).
Monitoring of RMS formation by VCT. RMS usually do not harm the
animals and it is possible to monitor their growth over longer periods of
time. Monitoring by noninvasive VCT using a laboratory animal fpVCT from
GE Global Research was performed as described previously (31). Tumor
sizes were determined according to the formula length  width  depth 
0.5 (32).
For assessment of the responsiveness of advanced stages of RMS to 5aza-dC/VPA treatment, tumor size was measured before and directly (d30)
after treatment and once a month thereafter (d60 and d90; see above).
Analysis of peripheral blood hemoglobin concentrations and
leukocyte counts. Two hundred microliters of EDTA blood were collected
from the retroorbital plexus before the onset of treatment, directly after the
treatment period, as well as at the end of the observation period. Leukocyte,

The biochemical reversibility of DNA methylation or histone
deacetylation has led to attempts of therapeutic application of
DNA-demethylating agents and histone deacetlyase (HDAC)
inhibitors. One of the classic DNA-demethylating agents is
5-aza-2¶deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), which substitutes the naturally
occurring cytidine during cell division and forms a covalent bond
between the DNA and the Dnmt enzyme. Both in vivo and in vitro,
5-aza-dC induces global and gene-specific DNA hypomethylation
(17). 5-aza-dC is currently used in clinical studies of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute and chronic leukemia.10,11
HDAC inhibitors cause hyperacetylation of histone proteins
leading to reactivation of silenced tumor suppressor genes, cell
cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation in a variety of cancer
cells. Several HDAC inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical
phase 1 and 2 studies (18, 19). One HDAC inhibitor is the short
chain fatty acid valproic acid (VPA; refs. 20, 21) that has been used
for many years in the treatment of epilepsy and as a mood
stabilizer (22).
Due to the interplay in regulation of gene transcription, Dnmt
and HDAC inhibitors exert synergistic effects in the reactivation of
silent genes in tumor cells (23). It has been shown that the effects
on tumor growth using a combination of the substances were
superior to the treatment with either 5-aza-dC or HDAC inhibitor
alone (19, 24–27).
Here, we investigated the in vivo effects of inhibition of
epigenetic silencing on prevention and treatment of Ptchassociated tumors. For this purpose, we first assessed the effect
of gene dosage of Dnmt1 on tumor development in Ptch neo67/ +
mice. Second, we examined the possibility of pharmacologic
reactivation of the wtPtch allele by 5-aza-dC and/or VPA and its
effects on tumor growth.

Materials and Methods
Compounds. 5-aza-dC and VPA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
diluted in Dulbecco’s PBS (PAN Biotech GmbH). For use in in vivo
experiments, fresh stocks of 120 Ag/mL 5-aza-dC and 320 mg/mL VPA were
prepared on ice and individually diluted in PBS to the desired drug dose for
each animal. Aliquots were stored for a maximum period of 2 wk at 80jC.
Experimental tumor models of Ptch-deficient mice. Wild-type or
heterozygous Ptch tm1Zim/ + mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 (B6) or a
mixed B6x BALB/c background [hereafter B6-Ptch neo67/ + or (B6xBalb)Ptch neo67/ +, respectively] and genotyped as described (28). B6-Ptch neo67/ +
mice develop MB at high incidence but are resistant to RMS formation. In
contrast, a mixed B6xBalb background confers strong susceptibility to RMS
but not to MB (29).
To evaluate the dependency of MB formation on DNA-methylation in a
genetic experiment, B6-Ptch neo67/ + were crossed to B6.129S4-Dnmt1 tm1Jae/ +
mice maintained on a B6 background (hereafter Dnmt1 N/ +). Dnmt1 N/ + mice
were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and genotyped as described by
Cormier and Dove (30).
All animals were treated and housed in accordance with the German
animal protection laws.
Determination of the maximum tolerable dose for 5-aza-dC and
VPA in B6 and B6xBalb mice. Eight-week-old B6 and B6xBalb wild-type
mice (n = 10 in each cohort) were injected i.p. (150 AL per injection) with
5-aza-dC (1.6, 0.4, or 0.1 mg/kg) or VPA (640 and 400 mg/kg) daily over
a period of 4 wk and followed for additional 8 wk.
The maximum tolerable dose (MTD) was defined as the dose at which all
animals survived the 4-wk treatment period and the consecutive 60 d of

erythrocyte, hemoglobin, and thrombocyte counts were measured with an
ABX Micros 45 Hematology Analyser (ABX Diagnostics).
Histopathology. RMS and corresponding normal skeletal muscle as well
as MB and cerebella were excised. Specimens used for isolation of total RNA
or DNA were frozen immediately after removal. A part of each sample was
embedded in paraffin for immunohistologic analysis.
For quantification of early stage MB lesions, the cerebella were subjected
to serial sectioning. The identity of the tumors as RMS, MB, or as MB
precursor lesions was confirmed using H&E-stained sections.
Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Total
RNA was extracted from murine tissues or peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC; isolated by Ficoll gradient) using TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich).
Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and SuperScriptII Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative Real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) was performed on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). The qRT-PCR assay for Igf2 expression was
the same as previously described (6). The primers and probes used for
quantification of wtPtch and D67Ptch transcripts as well as primers to
determine expression levels of Gli1, p21, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Ifitm2, Ifnc, IL-8Ra ,
and IL-8Rb expression levels by incorporation of SYBR green are shown in
the Supplementary Table S1. Amplification of 18s rRNA as an endogenous
control was performed to standardize the amount of sample RNA. Data
shown are the representatives for at least two independent experiments
conducted as triplicates.
Western blot analysis. For Western blot, tissue samples were lysed in
SDS lysis buffer [1% SDS, 10 mmol/L Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L sodium
vanadate] by boiling for 10 min. Equal amounts of proteins were separated
on a 15% SDS polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride

membrane (Millipore). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with
rabbit antiacetylated histone H4 (Upstate; 1:500) or rabbit anti-H2B
(Upstate; 1:3,000) antibodies diluted in 5% milk in PBST overnight at 4jC.
The peroxidase-conjugated Donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch; 1:10,000 in 5% milk in PBST) served as secondary antibody. Signals
were visualized using the SuperSignal West Dura detection system (Thermo
Scientific). Signal intensities were measured by densitometric analysis using
the Scion Image (Scion Corporation) program and acetylated H4 signals
was normalized to H2B signals to correct for differences in histone content
in the protein samples.
Bisulfite sequencing. The bisulfite conversion followed by PCR and
sequencing was applied to identify methylated bases in the Ptch promoter
in RMS treated thrice with 10 mg 5-aza-dC/wk, or with PBS (n = 3 each).
Genomic DNA was isolated 3 d after last injection using the Blood and
Tissue kit (Qiagen). Sodium bisulfite treatment was carried out using the
Bisulfite kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Five
CpG-rich fragments (1–5) of the 5¶ prime region of the Ptch gene were PCR
amplified using primers given in the Supplementary Table S1 and subcloned
into the pGEMTeasy vector (Promega GmbH). At least 12 clones per sample
were sequenced using a modified Sp6 primer (5‘-TTAGGTGACACTATAGAATACTCAAGC-3‘). The efficiency of bisulfite conversion was estimated
by measuring the conversion of non-CpG cytosines into uracil and was
>97% in all samples examined.
MeDIP. Global DNA methylation in PBS- or 5-aza-dC–treated (3  10 mg
5-aza-dC/wk) RMS was assessed by Methylated DNA ImmunoPrecipitation
(MeDIP) using the Methyl kit from Diagenode according to manufacturer‘s
instructions. Primers for amplification of major satellite sequences were
provided with the kit. To evaluate the relative enrichment of target sequence

Figure 1. Lifetime monitoring of symptomatic MB in Dnmt1 +/+; Ptch neo67/ + and Dnmt1 N/ +; Ptch neo67/ + mice and histologic analysis of cerebella. A, tumor-free
survival was significantly influenced by Dnmt1 heterozygosity (P = 0.021). The number of mice for each cohort is given in Table 1. B, representative H&E stained
sections of a normal cerebellum, a MB precursor lesion (subarachnoidal cell clusters and cells invading the molecular layer; arrows ), an early MB (arrowheads )
and an advanced stage of MB.

after MeDIP, the ratios of the signals in deimmunoprecipitated DNA versus
input DNA was calculated as recommended by the manufacturer.
Statistics. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assay group differences in
tumor-free survival. Two sided log-rank tests were performed. Gene
expression was analyzed after a logarithmic transformation within an
ANOVA setting. The required normal distribution of the residuals was
verified by a Shapiro-Wilk test. P values for group effects were adjusted for
multiple testing applying Dunnett’s method and considering vehicletreatment as the control group.
Changes in RMS volumes measured by VCT were analyzed after a
logarithmic transformation in a linear regression model. Considering an
exponential tumor growth, missing VCT data at day 30, 60, or 90 for each
RMS were generated by random missing data imputation, if necessary.
Statistical evaluation was performed using SAS 9.0 (SAS institute, Inc.). The
level of significance was set to V0.05.

Examination of cerebella of asymptomatic mice at day 250
revealed asymptomatic MB or MB precursor lesions (Fig. 1B) in
100% of mice with the Dnmt1 +/+; Ptch neo67/ + genotype and in 73%
of Dnmt1 N/ +; Ptch neo67/ + mice (P = 0.16 by m2 test; Table 1A).
Altogether, these data suggested that a 50% reduction in
endogenous Dnmt1 activity delays tumor growth in heterozygous
Ptch neo67/ + mice.
5-aza-dC/VPA combination therapy efficiently prevents
tumor formation in Ptch neo67/ + mice. In addition to leukocytopenia (see Material and Methods section), the MTD of 5-aza-dC
(0.1 mg/kg/d) and of VPA (400 mg/kg/d) led to a modulation of
gene expression in PBMC similarly to that observed humans
treated with 5-aza-dC (34) and to acetylation of H4 in the spleen,
respectively (Fig. 2A). This indicates that either drug-induced
changes in the expression of markers for DNA-methylation and
histone acetylation.
When 25- to 30-day-old heterozygous (B6xBalb)-Ptch neo67/ + mice
were treated daily for 12 weeks with cMTD of 5-aza-dC/VPA
or with PBS, 46% of PBS-treated, but only 6% of 5-aza-dC/VPAtreated animals developed palpable, histologically confirmed RMS
(P = 0.0004; Table 1B; Fig. 2B). In contrast, monotherapy with
5-aza-dC or VPA did not result in statistically significant increase
in tumor-free survival, although a positive trend was apparent
(P = 0.604; Fig. 2B).
Because some animals died for unknown reasons other than
RMS (see Table 1B), we reanalyzed the data by Kaplan-Meier
analyses using an end point defined as absence of RMS formation
or of death. Similarly to RMS-free survival, 5-aza-dC/VPA-treated
animals differed significantly compared with the PBS-treated group
(P = 0.019; data not shown) in respect of this end point, whereas no
significant differences were found for the single drug treatment
groups (P = 0.269; data not shown).
To determine the effect of both drugs on MB formation,
we treated B6-Ptch neo67/ + mice (n = 34) with the 1/2 cMTD of
5-aza-dC/VPA. Untreated B6-Ptch neo67/ + mice (n = 27) served as

Results
Reduced Dnmt1 activity delays onset of tumors in
Ptch neo67/+ mice. B6-Ptch neo67/ + mice were crossed with Dnmt1 N/ +
mice, which exhibit only 50% of wild-type Dnmt1 activity (33).
Because both strains were maintained on a B6 genetic background,
the offspring were monitored for the formation of MB, which
arise on this background (see Material and Methods section).
Animals with clinical MB symptoms were sacrificed and brain
tissues were subjected to histopathologic examination, as were
cerebella of the symptom-free mice at the end of the observation
period (250 days).
All Dnmt1 +/+; Ptch +/+ and Dnmt1 N/ +; Ptch +/+ mice remained
healthy (data not shown). In contrast, within 250 days of life, 63% of
Dnmt1 +/+; Ptch neo67/ + and 47% of Dnmt1 N/ +; Ptch neo67/ + mice
developed symptomatic MB, which was confirmed histologically. In
addition, 15% and 3% of mice with the respective genotype died for
unknown reasons, whereas 22% and 50% remained healthy
(numbers of animals are provided in Table 1A). The difference
in MB-free survival between Dnmt1 +/+; Ptch neo67/ + and Dnmt1 N/ +;
Ptch neo67/ + was statistically significant (P = 0.021; Fig. 1A).

Prevention of Ptch-Mediated Tumors by 5-Aza-dC/VPA

that it is possible to effectively reactivate its expression using
5-aza-dC/VPA.
Finally, we investigated the treatment effect on the expression
of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and p21 mRNA. 5-aza-dC affects the

controls (Table 1C). With respect to symptomatic, histologically
confirmed MB, there was a significant increase in tumor-free
survival in 5-aza-dC/VPA-treated animals when compared with
PBS-treated controls at 115 days of life (P = 0.017; Fig. 2C).
Growth of established tumors is not inhibited by 5-aza-dC/
VPA. To explore the therapeutic potential of 5-aza-dC/VPA on
clinically symptomatic tumors, RMS-bearing Ptch neo67/ + mice were
treated over a period of 30 days with cMTD 5-aza-dC/VPA or PBS
and subjected to VCT analysis before (d0), directly after treatment
(d30) and 1 and 2 months thereafter (d60, d90). Because some of
the individual animals bore more than one tumor, the growth rate
for each tumor was measured separately.
Throughout the experiment, neither 5-aza-dC/VPA- nor PBStreated animals developed new tumors. Similar percentages of
animals died or had to be sacrificed due to poor health in either
group. As shown in Fig. 3, the difference between growth rate of
the PBS- and 5-aza-dC/VPA-treated tumor was not significant
at any of the time points analyzed (P d30 = 0.603, P d60 = 0.832, and

(P = 0.197).
Histone acetylation and gene expression changes in RMS
and in normal skeletal muscle in response to 5-aza-dC and
VPA. Tissues from tumor-bearing (B6xBalb)-Ptch neo67/ + mice were
isolated 30 minutes to 2 hours after the last application of 5-azadC/VPA or PBS. In addition, samples were taken after the
medication-free follow-up period of 60 days after treatment.
Compared with PBS-treated RMS, acetylation of H4 was strongly
induced in tissue samples from treated mice (Fig. 4A).
Up-regulation of wtPtch expression was significant in 5-aza-dC/
VPA-treated RMS compared with PBS-treated control RMS
(P wtPtch = 0.012; Fig. 4B). This was accompanied by a moderate
down-regulation of D67Ptch transcripts (PD67Ptch = 0.448; Fig. 4B).
The effect of 5-aza-dC/VPA treatment on wtPtch and D67Ptch
expression was reversible after discontinuation of medication
(P wtPtch = 0.288; PD67Ptch = 0.773). In contrast to Ptch transcription,
Gli1 expression was not altered in RMS. The drugs also did not
influence the respective transcript levels in normal skeletal muscle
(Fig. 4B).
We next evaluated the ratio of D67Ptch to wtPtch transcripts and
compared them between normal skeletal muscle and RMS tissues
with and without epigenetic treatment. In normal muscle, the ratio
was between 0.8 and 1 in all cohorts independent of the treatment
(Fig. 4C). In PBS-treated RMS, the ratio was 104 and was reduced
7-fold after treatment with 5-aza-dC/VPA (P < 0.001). After the
treatment-free observation period the ratio increased again toward
the ratio of the control group (P = 0.366). Altogether, these data
suggest that wtPtch is epigenetically silenced in tumor tissue and

Methylation changes in 5-aza-dC–treated RMS. The Ptch
promoter contains 2 CpG islands [CpG-I1 and CpG-I2; as defined
by Takai and Jones (38), CpG island are composed of >500bp
with a G+C content of >65% and an observed CpG/expected
CpG ratio of >0.65] and a CpG-rich region (267 bp, G+C content
55%, CpG/expected CpG ratio 0.7; Fig. 5A). Thus far, only CpG-I1
has been investigated for tumor-specific methylation changes,
leading to conflicting results (9, 10). Bisulfite sequencing of DNA
derived from 5-aza-dC– or PBS-treated RMS revealed differential
DNA methylation in fragment 5 in response to 5-aza-dC:
Methylation was decreased in CpG 9 and 10 compared with
untreated RMS (Fig. 5A). In summary, the data provide evidence
that 5-aza-dC modulates the magnitude of methylation of Ptch
upstream sequences.
Global DNA methylation in the same PBS- or 5-aza-dC–treated
RMS was investigated by MeDIP. MeDIP revealed a >2-fold
reduction in the methylation level of major satellites in RMS after

Dnmt, because of its high affinity for hemimethylated DNA
template (39). In contrast, Dnmt3a and 3b constitute de novo
methylases that affect the methylation status of normally
unmethylated CpG sites (40, 41). In vitro methylation assays have
shown that Dnmt3a and 3b could cooperate with Dnmt1 in the
extension of methylation within the genome (42). The inability of
these de novo methylases in our study to compensate for the
reduced Dnmt1 activity emphasizes the attractiveness of the latter
enzyme as a therapeutic target in tumor therapies.
Methylation affects the growth of Ptch-associated tumors in
concert with histone deacetylation. Although monotherapy using
either 5-aza-dC or VPA was effective and diminished the number of
overt tumors, a statistically significant effect was achieved only
after a simultaneous inhibition of Dnmt and HDAC. This is in
agreement with studies demonstrating synergistic effects of Dnmtand HDAC inhibitors on reactivation of silent genes in tumor cells
(23), on growth inhibition of leukemias (27) and Non–Hodgkin
Lymphomas (19) and with our own observation that 5-aza-dC
combined with VPA exert a synergistic effect on p21 expression in
normal mouse muscle tissue (data not shown). The molecular
mechanism of this synergy is incompletely understood but likely
involves interaction of Dnmt and HDACs in mediating gene
silencing (24–26).
In contrast, Dnmt- and HDAC inhibitors had no effect on the
growth of advanced stages of Ptch-associated tumors. This

tumors. It was conducted on heterozygous Ptch knockout mice,
which, depending on the genetic background, spontaneously
develop two important childhood tumors, MB and RMS. The
results of both the genetic and the pharmacologic modulation
of methylation and histone deacetylation are consistent with
the involvement of these processes in the growth of tumors
associated with loss of Ptch function. Importantly, we have
identified one methylation-sensitive region within the murine Ptch
promoter that might be responsible for the re-expression of
Ptch in RMS after treatment with 5-aza-dC. As such, these results
may have implications for further optimization of therapies of
these tumors in children but also for other Ptch-associated
cancers in adults.
A 50% reduction of endogenous Dnmt1 expression by a genetic
approach resulted in a significant decrease in clinically overt
MB in B6-Ptch neo67/ + mice. This was caused by a slower growth
of tumors and is consistent with the well-known inhibitory
effect of Ptch on cell proliferation. On the other hand, Dnmt1
deficiency had no obvious effect on the initiation of MB, as there
was no statistically significant difference between Dnmt1 N/ +;
Ptch neo67/ + and Dnmt1 +/+; Ptch neo67/ + groups with respect to the
number of animals free of early MB precursor lesions or of
asymptomatic MB.
Of interest, the deficiency in Dnmt1 was not compensated in our
study by any other Dnmt. Dnmt1 is considered a maintenance

the prevention and treatment of early tumor stages (43) but fails to
inhibit growth of advanced stages tumors in Ptch neo67/+ mice (44).
Although the mechanism underlying the success of epigenetic
therapy in the prevention of RMS and MB in Ptch neo67/ + mice may be
in part independent from Hh/Ptch signaling and requires further
investigations, the study provides important results with respect to
novel treatment options of PTCH-associated tumors in humans.
Specifically, epigenetic therapy could be effectively used for
prevention of tumor formation or for controlling minimal residual
disease after conventional therapy, to reduce relapse rates and
treatment failure. For example, in childhood MB, epigenetic therapy
could play a role as consolidation therapy within a multimodal
treatment concept after the bulk tumor has been removed by surgery
and radiation. Because sporadic MB as well as BCC frequently show
mutations in, or loss of one PTCH allele, whereas the other PTCH
allele seems to be normal (45–48), it is possible that silencing of the
normal PTCH allele is also involved in the process of tumor
formation in humans. Thus, our studies might provide a new avenue
for therapies of tumor entities showing an epigenetic inactivation of
the tumor suppressor gene PTCH.

suggested either insufficient penetrance of the drugs into the
tumor or the latter’s lack of dependence on Ptch signaling. The
first possibility is unlikely because wtPtch expression was
efficiently reactivated in tumors by 5-aza-dC/VPA combination
therapy. Incidentally, reactivation of Ptch expression and the
identification of a methylation-sensitive region within the Ptch
promoter provides a further confirmation of our model of
tumorigenesis involving a methylation-based silencing of the
wtPtch allele. The treatment was also associated with a strong
induction of histone hyperacetylation, indicating inhibition of
HDACs. p21 expression was basically unchanged in the tumor,
perhaps due to its extremely high expression before treatment.
In contrast, we observed a strong induction of p21 in the
skeletal muscle, which exhibited much lower p21 basal
expression.
Although wtPtch was efficiently up-regulated upon 5-aza-dC/
VPA treatment, it was not sufficient to attenuate Hh signaling
activity in the tumors. This was shown by unchanged Gli1
expression levels and by only moderate down-regulation of
expression of the D67Ptch allele, the expression of which (as
another downstream target of Hh signaling) should have been
turned off as well. Because we observed that D67Ptch inhibits
wtPtch function in a dominant-negative manner,12 lack of
pathway inhibition might be mediated by the ratio of D67Ptch/
wtPtch transcript levels, which never reached the levels in
normal tissue.
Alternatively, advanced stages of tumors may have become
independent on Ptch signaling. This result would be in agreement
with our recent data with cyclopamine, which binds and inhibits Smo
and subsequently blocks Hh pathway activity. Cyclopamine works in
