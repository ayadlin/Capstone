Summary
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Genetic studies have established anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a cell surface receptor
tyrosine kinase, as a tractable molecular target in neuroblastoma. We describe comprehensive
genomic, biochemical, and computational analyses of ALK mutations across 1596 diagnostic
neuroblastoma samples. ALK tyrosine kinase domain mutations occurred in 8% of samples; at
three hotspots plus 13 minor sites – and correlated significantly with poorer survival in high- and
intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. Biochemical and computational studies distinguished oncogenic
(constitutively activating) from non-oncogenic mutations and allowed robust computational
prediction of their effects. We also established differential in vitro crizotinib sensitivity of mutated
variants. Our studies identify ALK genomic status as a clinically important therapeutic
stratification tool in neuroblastoma, and will allow tailoring of ALK-targeted therapy to specific
mutations.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Neuroblastomas are embryonal tumors that arise from the sympathetic nervous system, and
represent the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in the first year of life (Cheung and
Dyer, 2013; Maris, 2010). Despite improvements in treatment over recent decades, cure
rates for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (Maris, 2010) lag significantly behind those
of other common childhood cancers (Smith et al., 2010). Current treatments rely on doseintensive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapeutic targeting of the
disialoganglioside GD2 (Maris, 2010; Yu et al., 2010). Most recent clinical studies in
neuroblastoma have focused on escalating dose intensity in both induction and consolidation
therapy, with evidence that this improves outcome (Pearson et al., 2008). The potential longterm adverse effects of increasing treatment intensity on survivors of this childhood cancer
are a major concern (Hobbie et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2010), however – making it
imperative that more effective treatment strategies are developed.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

One promising avenue for targeted therapy in neuroblastoma focuses on anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK), a cell-surface neural receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expressed at
significant levels only in the developing embryonic and neonatal brain (Iwahara et al., 1997;
Morris et al., 1997). Germline mutations in intact ALK were recently identified as the major
cause of hereditary neuroblastoma (Mossé et al., 2008). These mutations cause single amino
acid missense substitutions in the ALK tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) that promote
constitutive, ligand-independent, activation of this RTK. Somatically acquired ALKactivating mutations are also found as oncogenic drivers in neuroblastoma (Chen et al.,
2008; George et al., 2008; Hallberg and Palmer, 2013; Janoueix-Lerosey et al., 2008; Mossé
et al., 2008). In addition, ALK gene amplification imparts an oncogenic dependency in some
cases (Janoueix-Lerosey et al., 2008; Mossé et al., 2008). ALK has thus emerged as a
tractable oncogene for targeted therapy in neuroblastoma. The same tyrosine kinase is also
found in oncogenic ALK fusion proteins that arise from chromosomal translocations in nonsmall-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) (Soda et al., 2007) and anaplastic large cell lymphomas
(Morris et al., 1994), for example, motivating development of small molecule ALK kinase
inhibitors. Dramatic response rates to crizotinib (an ALK/Met/Ros1 inhibitor) were seen in
pretreated patients with advanced relapsed/refractory NSCLC harboring ALK

rearrangements (Kwak et al., 2010; Shaw and Engelman, 2013). These studies validated
ALK as a therapeutic target, and led to the expedited FDA approval of crizotinib for ALKtranslocated NSCLC.
Rapid clinical translation of findings with ALK in neuroblastoma prompted a phase 1 trial of
crizotinib (NCT00939770) in patients with recurrent or refractory cancer. Results from this
trial highlighted the differential sensitivity to ALK kinase inhibition of ALK-translocated
versus ALK-mutated disease (Mossé et al., 2013). The study also underlined the need for
further detailed investigation of ALK mutations in order to optimize clinical application of
ALK inhibitors in neuroblastoma. To achieve this goal a detailed analysis of the spectrum of
ALK mutations, their clinical significance in neuroblastoma, and their biochemical
properties is essential. The resulting data will underpin future approaches for identifying
patients likely to benefit from ALK inhibition in neuroblastoma, and for predicting which
newly emerging mutations are clinically relevant.

Results
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To examine the spectrum of ALK mutations in neuroblastoma, we analyzed germline and
somatic ALK DNA alterations – at diagnosis – in samples from a cohort of 1596
neuroblastoma patients assembled in collaboration with the Children's Oncology Group
(COG; Table 1).
ALK mutations
Sequencing of ALK exons 21-28, encompassing the TKD-encoding region, identified 126
diagnostic samples with at least one mutation, corresponding to 8% of subjects (Table 1).
Putative disease-associated mutations were distributed throughout the ALK TKD (Figure 1;
Table S1), with an additional mutation at R1060 (between the TKD and transmembrane
domain). Three additional ALK TKD sequence variations (R1231Q, I1250T, and D1349H)
were observed that had previously been listed in the NCBI database of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (dbSNP), but with no known clinical significance or annotation in COSMIC
(Forbes et al., 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Three ‘hotspot’ residues accounted for 85% of mutations (Figure 1, Table 1): R1275 (43%),
F1174 (30%), and F1245 (12%), consistent with previous studies (Chen et al., 2008; George
et al., 2008; Hallberg and Palmer, 2013; Janoueix-Lerosey et al., 2008; Mossé et al., 2008).
R1275 was substituted with glutamine or leucine in 3.4% of tumors (95% CI: 2.5, 4.3%),
F1174 was altered (to L, I, V, C, or S) in 2.4% of tumors (95% CI: 1.6, 3.0%), and F1245 (to
L, I, V, or C) in 0.9% (95% CI: 0.5, 1.4%). Two tumor samples harbored mutations at I1170
(to N or S), and another two at I1171 (to N). Single incidences of substitution were seen at a
further 15 positions, of which 7 represent mutations not found in current databases (Table
S1). Matched constitutional DNA was available for 88 of the 126 ALK-mutated samples, and
contained the observed ALK substitution (indicating its presence in the germline) in just 7
cases. Although no information about family history is available, this is an expected rate
based on previous analyses (Knudson and Strong, 1972; Mossé et al., 2008). Two were
germline R1275Q mutations, and the remaining 5 examples were R1060H, I1183T, L1204F,
R1231Q (also in dbSNP), and I1250T (also in dbSNP) mutations (Table S1).

ALK mutations were found in 10.9% of MYCN-amplified tumors, versus 7.2% of those
without MYCN amplification. Mutations seen alongside MYCN amplification were biased
towards F1174 substitutions (41% in MYCN-amplified cases compared with 30% overall).
Further, MYCN amplification occurred in 39% of F1174-mutated tumors, compared with an
expected overall frequency of 21% (p<0.01). These data support previous suggestions that
F1174 mutations are over-represented in MYCN-amplified tumors, but indicate a less
skewed distribution than reported earlier (De Brouwer et al., 2010). Consistent with earlier
results, however, patients with both amplified MYCN and F1174-mutated ALK had a
significantly worse event-free survival (EFS, p<0.0001) than patients with neither.
ALK copy number

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Copy number variation at the ALK locus was observed in 17% of cases for which it was
measured (Table 1). Gain of the ALK locus (3-10 copies) was seen in 195 cases (15%), with
high-level amplification more rare (24 samples), and whole gene deletion rarer still (6
samples). The ALK gene is located 13.2 megabases centromeric of MYCN. ALK
amplification occurred concurrently with MYCN amplification in all but one case –
consistent with a previous report (Bagci et al., 2012). Accordingly, since MYCN
amplification identifies a patient as a member of the high-risk group (Maris, 2010), ALK
amplification occurred exclusively in this group (Table S2) and was associated with inferior
outcome (5-year overall survival/OS of 23%, versus 48% in high-risk patients without ALK
amplification, p=0.03; Table S3). In the 108/126 ALK-mutated tumors for which we also had
copy number data, ALK mutation and high-level gene amplification were mutually exclusive
(except for one G1286 variant). Further, 13% of ALK-mutated cases had low-level gain of
the ALK locus, similar to the percentage seen in the overall cohort. None demonstrated
allelic deletion.
ALK aberration and ALK mutation are prognostic biomarkers of inferior survival

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ALK mutations were observed in tumors from all clinical risk groups, and were more
commonly observed in those from older patients (Table S2). Across the whole cohort,
presence of an ALK aberration (mutation or amplification) correlated with reduced EFS and
OS (Figure 2A,B) – as did ALK mutation (Table 1). Presence of any ALK aberration also
correlated with reduced EFS and OS in the high-risk group (Figure 2C,D). In univariable
analysis, presence of an ALK mutation was also correlated with reduced EFS in
intermediate-risk patients (Table S3), a heterogeneous group consisting mainly of very
young patients with metastatic disease, or patients of any age with large, unresectable
primary tumors. Patient outcome did not differ significantly according to location of the
mutation in any analysis. Whereas robust biomarkers to assign outcome probability have
been characterized for patients with low- and high-risk disease, the most appropriate therapy
for patients with intermediate-risk disease is less well-defined, and our findings suggest that
ALK genetic status can be used to identify cases within this group with the highest risk of
treatment failure.
In multivariable analysis of the overall cohort, presence of an ALK mutation was found to
have an independent influence on survival, with a 1.4-fold greater risk of an event (or hazard
ratio, HR) within 5 years (95% CI: 1.1, 1.9) compared to cases without an ALK mutation

(Table 2). Similarly, independent statistically significant correlation with outcome was seen
in three separate multivariable models (adjusted for other known prognostic factors) for:

Any ALK aberration (p=0.0006; HR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.2, 1.7)

ii. ALK copy number gain (p=0.04; HR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6)
iii. ALK amplification (p=0.003; HR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.3, 3.6).
In a multivariable model adjusted for histologic category (Table 2), ALK mutation status
showed statistically significant correlation with reduced EFS in both the intermediate-risk
and high-risk patient groups – although not in the low-risk group, again arguing for the
utility of ALK mutation status in clinical evaluation.
Predicting signaling consequences of ALK TKD mutations

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our results establish that the presence of an ALK mutation in neuroblastoma is associated
with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Not all ALK substitutions observed in
neuroblastoma patients are likely to be oncogenic drivers, however. It will be important in
refining therapeutic ALK mutation-based patient stratification to predict as they are observed
which mutations are truly drivers that cause ligand-independent ALK signaling, and which
are ‘passengers’ or variants of unknown significance. Current methods for predicting
functional consequences of patient-derived mutations fall short – especially for activating
mutations in kinases. Algorithms such as PolyPhen-2 (Adzhubei et al., 2010), SIFT (Kumar
et al., 2009) and the consensus classifier PredictSNP (Bendl et al., 2014) estimate the
likelihood of a given mutation having a deleterious effect based on sequence conservation
and other criteria. PolyPhen-2 or SIFT (or both) predict that every single ALK substitution
listed in Table S1 adversely affects protein function (or is ‘damaging’), except R1060H and
R1231Q (a SNP). It seems highly unlikely given our understanding of kinases that even the
ALK TKD C-lobe mutations L1204F, T1343I, and D1349H (also in dbSNP) are oncogenic.
Moreover, the logic of conservation-based algorithms is not appropriate for predicting gainof-function mutations in oncogenic kinase domains (Gnad et al., 2013). Indeed, a recent
analysis of >400 activating substitutions (Molina-Vila et al., 2014) revealed that most driver
mutations in oncogenic kinases do not occur at conserved residues at all, and that their
accurate prediction will require explicit attention to kinase regulation mechanisms.
Motivated by these considerations, we assessed the effects of all ALK mutations defined
here (Figure 1 and Table S1) on in vitro kinase activity – to guide development of better
prediction algorithms.
Biochemical effects of clinically-observed ALK TKD mutations
We first monitored autophosphorylation of purified mutated ALK TKDs using native gel
electrophoresis (Figure S1) as described (Bresler et al., 2011). The well-studied F1174L and
R1275Q mutations greatly accelerated TKD autophosphorylation as expected. So did
substitutions at 5 of the other positions listed in Table S1 (M1166, I1170, I1171, F1245, and
Y1278), as did the previously reported G1128A and R1192P germline neuroblastoma
mutations (Bourdeaut et al., 2011; Janoueix-Lerosey et al., 2008; Mossé et al., 2008).
Mutations at T1151, L1196, and G1286 also promoted modest constitutive activation. By
contrast, substitutions at five other sites (I1183, A1200, R1231, T1343, and D1349) and

those found in dbSNP (R1231Q and D1349H) failed to activate the isolated TKD (Figure
S1), signifying that these are unlikely to be clinically significant. D1270G-mutated ALK
TKD failed to become autophosphorylated at all, suggesting that this is an inactivating
mutation – as expected since D1270 lies in the conserved DFG motif essential for Mg2+ATP binding to kinases. We did not analyze ALK TKDs harboring L1204F, L1240V, or
I1250T mutations in this assay, since they were poorly expressed as recombinant proteins.
For more quantitative analyses, we assayed the ability of the mutated TKDs to
phosphorylate a peptide corresponding to ALK's activation loop, and determined values for
kcat, KM, ATP, and kcat/KM in vitro. We analyzed both fully auto-phosphorylated ALK TKDs
and non-phosphorylated proteins (phosphatase treated as described in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures). Non-phosphorylated ALK TKD represents the ‘basal’ kinase
state for each receptor variant, whereas autophosphorylated ALK TKDs represent the
corresponding activated states – with kcat increased by ∼45-fold in the case of wild-type
ALK (Bresler et al., 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Effects of mutations on basal activity of non-phosphorylated ALK TKD—The
effects of mutations on non-phosphorylated ALK TKD activity vary according to their
location in the kinase. F1174 and F1245 mutations have the strongest effect, increasing kcat
by 36-39 fold (Figure 3A; Table S4) – close to the 45-fold increase caused by
autophosphorylation of wild-type ALK TKD (Bresler et al., 2011). F1174 and F1245
contribute to a cluster of phenylalanine side-chains (red in Figure 3: the ‘Phe core’) that
normally stabilizes the autoinhibited TKD conformation (Bossi et al., 2010; Lee et al.,
2010). Mutating these residues will destabilize ALK's autoinhibitory interactions and
promote activation. Almost all of the other significantly activating mutations (increasing kcat
by >10-fold) occur either at residues in the αC-helix (M1166, I1170, I1171) or in the short
α-helix within the activation loop of the inactive TKD (R1275, Y1278). These residues
(blue in Figure 3) all participate in autoinhibitory interactions between helix αC and the
activation loop α-helix that normally stabilize the inactive conformation of nonphosphorylated ALK TKD (Bossi et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010), and are disrupted by the
mutations analyzed here. Mutations in the N-lobe (green) or phosphate-binding P-loop
(cyan) have much smaller effects on ALK TKD (Figure 3A). The only exception is the
germline R1192P mutation (which increases kcat of non-phosphorylated ALK TKD by 15
fold). Mutations in the ALK TKD active site (magenta) or C-lobe (grey) have little or no
influence on kcat (<3-fold increase), except for the L1196M ‘gatekeeper’ mutation, which
increases kcat by nearly 5 fold. Peptide phosphorylation studies further confirmed that the
D1270G variant is inactive (Table S4), and revealed a reduced activity for the I1250T (SNP)
variant, consistent with previous work (Schönherr et al., 2011a).
KM, ATP values for non-phosphorylated ALK TKD variants (discussed in more detail below)
all fell within a narrow range from 0.13 mM (wild-type) to 0.39 mM (L1196M) – suggesting
that all variants are saturated with ATP under physiological conditions (Figure 3B).
Accordingly, catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM, ATP) for non-phosphorylated ALK TKD
variants (Figure S2A) follow very similar trends to those seen for kcat. The same is true for
kcat/KM, peptide values (Figure S2B).

Effects of neuroblastoma mutations on activity of fully autophosphorylated
ALK TKD—The effects of patient-derived ALK mutations on the activity of fully
autophosphorylated ALK TKD (prepared as described in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures) were much more modest. With the exception of the I1170N variant (for which
kcat was just 35% of wild-type), no variant was altered by more than 2-fold in kcat (Figure
3C, Table S5). Overall, therefore, neuroblastoma-derived mutations have their greatest
effects on the activity of non-phosphorylated ALK TKD, promoting its constitutive
autophosphorylation and thus ligand-independent signaling by the intact receptor.
Transforming ability of mutated ALK variants

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To assess how biochemical characteristics relate to transforming ability we measured the
ability of intact ALK variants harboring the same TKD mutations to induce focus formation
in NIH 3T3 cells (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4B and C, quantitation of focus formation
assays (Table S6) reveals a remarkably close correspondence between transforming
potential and in vitro kcat value for the corresponding non-phosphorylated TKD variants
(Figure 3A). A plot of transforming ability against kcat for non-phosphorylated TKD (Figure
4C) yields a straight line with correlation coefficient (r) of 0.95 (p<0.0001). Relative outliers
were G1128A (in the P-loop) and L1196M (in the active site), which both appeared
relatively more transforming than suggested by in vitro biochemical data, and M1166R,
which appeared less transforming than expected by this simple correlation. Transforming
potential correlates with kcat of the non-phosphorylated TKD slightly better than it does with
either measure of catalytic efficiency: kcat/KM, ATP (r=0.88) or kcat/KM, peptide (r=0.89). By
contrast, when transforming ability is plotted against kcat for phosphorylated TKD variants,
the slope does not deviate significantly from zero (p=0.68), indicating no correlation (Figure
4C, Figure S2C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Taken together, the data in Figures 3 and 4 argue that activity of the non-phosphorylated
ALK TKD is an excellent predictor of ALK's transforming ability in NIH 3T3 cells. An
increase of just 4.6 – 4.8-fold in the kcat of non-phosphorylated ALK TKD appears
sufficient for NIH 3T3 cell transformation, judging from results with the G1128A (cyan)
and L1196M (magenta) variants (Figure 4, Table S4). The one exception to this correlation
is the N-lobe T1151M variant, for which a relatively reduced kcat/KM, peptide value (Figure
S2B, Table S4) may explain failure to transform NIH 3T3 cells (presumably because of
elevated KM, peptide). It is important to note that none of the three ALK mutations previously
reported in dbSNP (R1231Q, I1250T, and D1349H, all in the C-lobe) were associated with
ALK activation in transformation or biochemical assays (Figures 3 and 4); these are silent or
passenger mutations. Moreover, analysis of transforming ability in Figure 4B (as a measure
of oncogenicity) paints a very different functional picture from that predicted by PolyPhen-2
or SIFT across the spectrum of ALK mutations. These algorithms predict that all mutations
(except R1060H and R1231Q) are damaging or affect function – whereas our experimental
analysis shows that 11 of the 24 mutations have no significant activating effect. ALK is
unlikely to be an important driver in neuroblastoma cases with any of these non-activating
mutations, and crizotinib is very unlikely to be therapeutically useful in these contexts. The
‘silent’ mutations account for one of every ∼11 of ALK-mutated patients, and it is important
to identify them.

Crizotinib sensitivities of recombinant ALK TKD variants

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

At least two of the ALK driver mutations observed in neuroblastoma (F1174L and L1196M)
have also arisen as acquired crizotinib resistance mutations in tumors driven by oncogenic
ALK fusion proteins (Choi et al., 2010; Sasaki et al., 2010). These findings suggest that
primary resistance will be a major concern in crizotinib treatment of ALK-mutated
neuroblastoma, as we have discussed previously (Bresler et al., 2011). A mere ∼3-fold
reduction in KM, ATP appeared sufficient to impair in vivo crizotinib sensitivity of F1174Lmutated ALK when compared with the R1275Q variant, consistent with the appearance of
F1174L as an acquired resistance mutation in both a crizotinib-treated inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumor (Sasaki et al., 2010) and in vitro screens for crizotinib-resistance
mutations in EML4-ALK (Zhang et al., 2011). Table 3 lists KM, ATP values for the other
non-phosphorylated ALK TKD variants described here. Based solely on reduced KM, ATP
values (as for F1174L), and assuming unchanged crizotinib affinity, the G1128A, M1166R,
F1245C, F1245V, or Y1278S variants would be suggested to be relatively crizotinib
resistant, whereas the I1170N, I1170S, I1171N, and L1196M (gatekeeper) variants would be
argued to resemble R1275Q in being sensitive to crizotinib (with relatively larger KM, ATP
values). R1192P is intermediate.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Direct measurement of crizotinib IC50 values in vitro (at 2 mM ATP), however, reveals that
the correlation with KM, ATP is not simple. The L1196M (gatekeeper) variant is resistant to
crizotinib (Figure S3) despite its high KM, ATP – indicating a differential effect of this
mutation on ATP and crizotinib binding, as expected from its appearance as an acquired
resistance mutation (Katayama et al., 2011). Similarly, I1171N-mutated ALK is less
crizotinib sensitive in vitro than a simple view of ATP competition (and KM, ATP) would
suggest – further supported by the fact that mutations at I1171 emerged alongside F1174
mutations in screens for crizotinib-resistant variants of EML4-ALK (Zhang et al., 2011). By
contrast, the M1166R, F1245V, and F1245C variants are more sensitive to crizotinib in vitro
than simple consideration of KM, ATP would suggest – resembling the R1275Q variant in our
in vitro crizotinib inhibition studies (Table 3) and NIH 3T3 focus assays (not shown). This
finding is particularly important given that F1245 is the third most commonly mutated site
in neuroblastoma, accounting for ∼12% of mutations. Our data suggest that cases with
F1245 mutations should respond to crizotinib just as well as R1275Q-mutated tumors.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The data in Table 3 make it clear that the individual ALK TKD mutations affect binding of
ATP and crizotinib in different ways, and assessment of IC50 values for a selection of
mutations in NIH 3T3 focus assays (not shown) concurs. For example, the L1196M
mutation impairs crizotinib binding more than ATP binding – thus causing resistance to the
drug. It will therefore be important to compare the relative abilities of next generation ALK
inhibitors to inhibit the variants studied here. One new inhibitor, called ceritinib, was
recently shown to inhibit ALK variants with crizotinib-resistant L1196M, or I1171T
mutations (Friboulet et al., 2014), but not to overcome resistance of an F1174 mutation.
Other inhibitors are also known to have differential effects on crizotinib-resistance
mutations acquired in ALK-rearranged lung cancers (Johnson et al., 2014; Sakamoto et al.,
2011). The data in Table 3 suggest that neuroblastoma patients with ALK-activating
M1166R, I1170N/S or F1245 mutations should respond to crizotinib just as well as

R1275Q-mutated patients. Patients with I1171 or L1196 mutations are likely to respond
better to ceritinib, and those with F1174L (and possible other) mutations might be more
responsive to the macrocyclic inhibitor PF-06463922 (Johnson et al., 2014). Y1278, R1192
and G1128 mutations appear to be intermediate between these two groups, and comparative
studies of ALK inhibitors are needed to determine which inhibitor would be best for these
cases.
Computational analysis of mutated ALK TKDs
The poor performance of existing informatics-based approaches in distinguishing activating
from non-activating amino acid substitutions prompted us to investigate structure-based
computational methods for assessing newly emerging ALK mutations. Importantly, apart
from already published data, the computational analysis was done without prior knowledge
of biochemical results emerging from this study. As described in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures, we simulated molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories for the
inactive conformation of all mutated ALK TKD variants, and for wild-type ALK TKD, in
both active and inactive conformations. The resulting MD trajectories were analyzed for
three key structural properties:

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

i). Hydrogen bonding network—Distinct sets of key intramolecular hydrogen bonds
characterize the active and inactive ALK TKD configurations. Those that maintain the
(autoinhibited) positions of the activation loop and αC helix in the inactive TKD (in Figure
3D) are absent in the active structure. A simple scoring function (see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures) was used to determine whether each mutation promotes a more
‘active-like’ or ‘inactive-like’ hydrogen-bonding network (Table 4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ii). Hydrophobic interaction network—As mentioned above, key autoinhibitory
interactions are stabilized in the inactive conformation by residues with hydrophobic sidechains – notably those in the Phe-core (red in Figure 3D) and contacts between the αC-helix
and short activation-loop helix (blue in Figure 3D). Disruption of these autoinhibitory
hydrophobic interactions can be assessed readily by monitoring the solvent-accessible
surface area (SASA) of relevant residues throughout the MD trajectories. If SASA increases
as a result of a neuroblastoma mutation, the mutation is classed as ‘activating’. To further
determine whether observed changes in SASA favor the active state, free energy
perturbation (FEP) simulations were used to determine whether each mutation significantly
destabilizes the inactive state relative to the active state (in which case it is classed as
‘activating’).
iii). Principal component analysis (PCA)—PCA reveals correlated global motions
across the MD trajectory. The top 10 dominant modes are considerably different (greater) in
the active conformation than in inactive ALK TKD (indicating greater motion), as seen for
other kinases (Shih et al., 2011). As outlined in Supplemental Experimental Procedures,
each mutant with a top eigenvalue above 200 Å2 is scored as activating (indicating
destabilization of key autoinhibitory interactions).

A mutation is predicted to be ‘activating’ overall if it scores as such in one or more of the
three criteria outlined above. As shown in Table 4, predictions for each mutated ALK TKD
variant studied here agree quite well with our experimental studies. Moreover, the
computational analysis suggests a possible mechanism of activation for each mutation, i.e.,
by perturbing hydrophilic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, or global conformation. All
of the mutations that elevate kcat of non-phosphorylated ALK TKD by over 5-fold were
predicted correctly except two (I1171N, and F1245C), as listed in Table 4. Perhaps more
importantly, our computational analysis correctly predicts the majority of mutations that are
not activating – thus showing its value in distinguishing passenger from driver mutations
and its potential utility for patient stratification. There are a few exceptions, however. The
T1151M mutation was designated as activating in our computational analysis, but did not
transform NIH 3T3 cells (Figure 4). Although biochemical analysis indicated an elevated
kcat for this variant, it has a reduced kcat/KM, peptide, apparently arising from an elevated
KM, peptide that would not be captured computationally. The I1250T and D1270G mutations
– both also predicted to be activating using our computational approach – are special cases.
D1270 is the conserved DFG aspartate, and loss of its side-chain removes a functional group
essential for Mg2+ binding to the TKD. The I1250T mutation impairs protein stability and/or
folding (as assessed by poor expression) in a way that the model cannot predict, so no
activating effect is seen experimentally. The computational analysis also failed to predict
three transforming mutations (Table 4): F1245C, I1171N, and L1196M (the gatekeeper
mutation), for reasons that are less clear. Overall, however, our computational approach
correctly predicts 75% of the transforming mutations and – importantly – over 75% of silent
mutations (excepting special cases). By contrast, PolyPhen-2 (Table 4, right-most column)
predicts only one silent mutation correctly and is plagued with false positives. It is important
to reiterate that our computational studies were undertaken with no prior knowledge of the
results shown in Figures 3 and 4 (with the exception of previously published results).

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Discovery of activating mutations in the intact ALK gene as drivers in neuroblastoma
provided the first example of a pediatric cancer caused by germline mutations in an
oncogene, and the only druggable mutation in a pediatric solid tumor. We characterized the
spectrum and frequency of germline and somatic alterations in ALK across all
neuroblastoma disease subsets in 1596 patients. This dataset is powered to identify ALK
mutations in neuroblastoma that, while rare, are still clinically relevant, and to have
sufficient power to determine the prognostic capability of ALK alterations within each
neuroblastoma risk group (high, intermediate, and low). In addition, cataloguing ALK
mutations in these tumors allowed us to correlate sequence variations with oncogenic
potency. Some of the observed mutations are unlikely to be oncogenic, and the activated
variants differ in their sensitivity to crizotinib – with potentially important therapeutic
implications. In multivariable models of the overall cohort, and within each risk group, both
the presence of an ALK mutation (except within the low-risk group) and the presence of any
ALK aberration were shown to correlate independently with worse EFS. These findings
illustrate the value of determining ALK status for prognostic patient stratification, and also
support the potential importance of ALK as a therapeutic target.

ALK mutations were observed in 8% of neuroblastoma patients, and span the entire
spectrum of disease, including INSS Stage 4 disease, congenital cases, and adolescents/
young adults. The fact that ALK mutations occur at the highest frequency (17%) in patients
older than 10 suggests differences in the occurrence of genetic mutations based on age,
reminiscent of the recently reported age distribution of ATRX mutations in neuroblastoma
(Cheung et al., 2012). Within the high-risk subset of neuroblastoma patients the overall
frequency of ALK aberration is 14% (10% mutation, 4% amplification). High-risk patients
have the poorest outcomes, with approximately only 50% OS despite intensive multi-modal
therapy including chemotherapy, surgery, myeloablative conditioning with bone marrow
transplant, radiation therapy and immunotherapy plus retinoic acid (Maris, 2010) – making
these patients excellent candidates for ALK-targeted therapy. Within the low- and
intermediate-risk groups, the frequency of ALK aberration is 6% and 8% respectively. In
low-risk cases, therapy usually involves observation, with or without surgical intervention,
whereas patients with intermediate-risk disease are treated with conventional cytotoxic
chemotherapy and are at risk for the associated late effects. Our results suggest an important
opportunity within the intermediate-risk group to identify those with an activating ALK
mutation for treatment with ALK inhibitors and de-escalation of traditional cytotoxic
therapy.
Of the 24 different patient-derived ALK mutations assessed, only 13 drove transformation of
NIH 3T3 cells. Where our studies overlap with other analyses of transformation by ALK
variants found in neuroblastoma, they are in complete agreement (Chand et al., 2013;
George et al., 2008; Schönherr et al., 2011a; Schönherr et al., 2011b). Importantly, every
mutation that promoted transformation also constitutively activated the ALK TKD, with
remarkable correlation between transforming activity and in vitro kcat value for the nonphosphorylated TKD. Eleven of the 24 mutations (representing 9% of ALK-mutated patients
in this study) appeared silent or even inactivating. Of the activating mutations, in vitro
analyses suggest that only 6 (including R1275Q) will be sensitive to inhibition by crizotinib
in vivo. Some others are likely to respond better to next generation inhibitors that appear
capable of inhibiting L1196M and I1171 variants (ceritinib) or F1174 variants
(PF-06463922). Further comparative studies with these inhibitors are required to identify
which is optimal for each variant.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Using a molecular dynamics (MD)-based computational approach, we showed that we can
predict which mutations are activating – and more importantly which are not activating –
with a success rate that greatly exceeds methods such as SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PredictSNP, and
others. For example, our method correctly (and blindly) predicted the consequences of all
newly described ALK mutations presented in this report, with D1270G as the one exception
(where a catalytically crucial residue is mutated). It is important to note that our
computational analysis assesses kinase activation, and not transformation itself – but our
biochemical data indicate that elevating kcat of non-phosphorylated ALK TKD by 4.6-fold
or more causes the receptor to be transforming. Our computational analysis of ALK
mutations has significant promise as a clinical tool, and will improve with further training
and testing using additional clinically observed (and experimental) mutations. It will also be

important to apply computational approaches similar to those that we have employed for
EGFR (Park et al., 2012) in efforts to predict inhibitor sensitivity.

Our findings allow us to formulate molecular diagnostic screening recommendations for
newly diagnosed neuroblastoma patients, which will be important in clinical evaluation of
ALK inhibitors for childhood cancer. We demonstrate that ALK is a predictive therapeutic
biomarker of disease status, and also provides a therapeutic target in a select group of
patients. With additional molecularly targeted therapeutics and computational models that
leverage biochemical understanding to predict the effect of newly emerging ALK mutations,
we should now be able to make upfront predictions about which patients are most likely to
respond to crizotinib or other ALK inhibitors and (importantly) identify those that will not.
Related approaches have been successful with imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia,
gefitinib in NSCLC, and most recently crizotinib in ALK-translocated NSCLC – although
functional stratification of individual mutations along the lines described here has not yet
been achieved. We are now poised to develop a responder hypothesis as part of a therapeutic
strategy that incorporates pharmacologic ALK inhibition into the backbone of contemporary
treatment regimens in neuroblastoma. Our phase 1 trial of crizotinib showed some promising
responses even in heavily pretreated patients with ALK mutations with recurrent or
refractory late-stage disease (Mossé et al., 2013), despite the facts that these heavily pretreated patients are frequently multi-drug resistant, and also show an increased prevalence of
p53 mutations at relapse (Carr-Wilkinson et al., 2010) – confounding factors that were not
assessed. In newly diagnosed patients, where these issues are not relevant (and p53
mutations are rare), we expect upfront ALK-targeted treatment guided by the results
described here to yield dramatically improved results.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition, our findings will help advance the management of individuals with
neuroblastoma predisposition. Individuals with a germline ALK variation of unknown
significance may have siblings who also harbor these variants, emphasizing the importance
of understanding which alleles are indeed risk-alleles so as to determine their risk of
developing neuroblastoma, and to offer appropriate clinical screening. No models have yet
been established for effective early detection strategies or improving clinical outcomes when
germline ALK variations are detected. Implementing clinical surveillance strategies for
unaffected children (possibly even adults) with neuroblastoma carrying a germline ALK
variant should be guided by data such as those presented here, recognizing the implications
of the use of predictive genetic screening and surveillance practices and the absence of
evidence of benefit from early detection in these individuals.

Experimental Procedures
Patient population
ALK genomic status was evaluated in 1596 diagnostic tumor DNA samples from patients
enrolled on COG neuroblastoma biology protocol ANBL00B1. Matched germline DNA was
available in 88 of the 126 cases with identified ALK mutations. Most samples were
annotated with clinical and genomic information including age, site of origin, International
Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stage, International Neuroblastoma Pathologic
Classification (INPC), MYCN copy number, DNA index, registration on clinical trial(s),

event-free and overall survival, and tumor DNA copy number/LOH status at chromosome
bands 1p36 and 11q23 (Attiyeh et al., 2005; Morowitz et al., 2003). All cases had a
confirmed diagnosis of neuroblastoma, and had associated informed consent and enrollment
on a COG biology study. This research was approved by the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia Institutional Review Board and the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.
Sequencing and copy number determination
Sanger-based DNA re-sequencing of the ALK TKD (exons 21-28) was performed by
Beckman Coulter Genomics using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing chemistry on
an ABI PRISM 3730×l sequencer. Electropherograms were analyzed using Sequencher 4.9
software. For each tumor harboring a somatic mutation, we sequenced the corresponding
amplicon in matched germline DNA where available. Variations were crosschecked for
polymorphism status in dbSNP and COSMIC databases, and a panel of 218 normal control
alleles. Copy number determination employed whole-genome SNP-array analyses (550k) for
577 samples, and realtime quantitative PCR for 1122 (see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Statistical considerations
Risk factors tested for prognostic significance were age (<18 months versus ≥18 months),
INSS stage (stage 1,2,3,4s versus stage 4), histology (favorable versus unfavorable), ploidy
(hyperdiploid versus diploid), MYCN status (not amplified versus amplified), 11q status (no
loss versus LOH), and 1p status (no loss versus LOH). For univariable analyses, EFS and
OS times were calculated as described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. A chisquared test was used to test association between each risk factor and presence of ALK
mutation, presence of ALK copy number variation, and presence of any ALK aberration. p
values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, with p<0.05 considered statistically
significant. For multivariable analyses, using backwards selection model building, a Cox
proportional hazards regression model was used to test for the independent statistical
significance of ALK mutations or copy number variations after adjustment for statistically
significant risk factors, and to calculate the p value and hazard ratio (HR) for each factor.

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

This work establishes pre-clinical rationale for therapeutic stratification of neuroblastoma
patients for ALK inhibition therapy based on ALK genomic status. Beyond previously
established risk factors, presence of an ALK aberration (mutation or amplification) is a
prognostic biomarker for poorer survival. Presence of an ALK tyrosine kinase domain
mutation also correlates with worse prognosis in high- and intermediate risk patients.
Biochemical and functional cellular analyses allowed us to determine which mutations
are oncogenic drivers, and to develop robust computational approaches for identifying
disease-significant ALK mutations as they emerge clinically. Assessing in vitro
sensitivity to crizotinib also suggests strategies for its application in the clinic.
Stratification based on ALK status thus has significant potential for improving outcomes
for a significant patient subset.

The 126 potentially disease-related mutations observed were distributed over the 16
positions marked in the ALK TKD plus R1060 (between the TKD and the transmembrane
domain, upper part of figure). Variants with red asterisks (in red text) were also found in
germline DNA. Mutations not previously reported in neuroblastoma include R1060H,
I1170N, I1183T, L1204F, D1270G, G1286R, and T1343I. See also Table S1 and Figure S1.

(A) Representative focus formation assays for NIH 3T3 cells transfected with intact ALK
variants or empty vector. (B) Quantitation of data from (A). To correct for transfection
efficiency, the number of foci for each transfection was divided by the number of G418resistant colonies, and transforming ability plotted as foci per G418-resistant colony. Each
independent experiment was performed in duplicate and data are presented as mean ± SEM
of at least three independent experiments (see Table S6). (C) Plots of ALK transforming
ability against in vitro kcat for non-phosphorylated ALK TKD (left) or autophosphorylated
ALK TKD (right). The lines are linear regressions to the data. Correlation coefficients were
0.95 (non-phosphorylated) and 0.095 (phosphorylated), with significant deviation from zero
for non-phosphorylated ALK TKD (p<0.0001) but not phosphorylated ALK TKD (p=0.68).
