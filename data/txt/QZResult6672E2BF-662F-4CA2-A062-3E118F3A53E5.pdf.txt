ABSTRACT
Clinical trials of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors have been limited by
high toxicity. We previously showed that the Hsp90 inhibitor, SNX-7081, synergizes
with and restores sensitivity to fludarabine nucleoside (2-FaraA) in human chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with lesions in the p53 pathway (Best OG, et al.,
Leukemia Lymphoma 53:1367-75, 2012). Here, we used label-free quantitative shotgun
proteomics and comprehensive bioinformatic analysis to determine the mechanism of
this synergy. We propose that 2-FaraA-induced DNA damage is compounded by SNX7081-mediated inhibition of DNA repair, resulting in enhanced induction of apoptosis.
DNA damage responses are impaired in part due to reductions in checkpoint regulators
BRCA1 and cyclin D1, and cell death is triggered following reductions of MYC and
nucleolin and an accumulation of apoptosis-inducing NFkB2 p100 subunit. Loss of
nucleolin can activate Fas-mediated apoptosis, leading to the increase of pro-apoptotic
proteins (BID, fas-associated factor-2) and subsequent apoptosis of p53-negative,
2-FaraA refractory CLL cells. A significant induction of DNA damage, indicated by
increases in DNA damage marker gH2AX, was observed following the dual drug
treatment of additional cell lines, indicating that a similar mechanism may operate in
other p53-mutated human B-lymphoid cancers. These results provide valuable insight
into the synergistic mechanism between SNX-7081 and 2-FaraA that may provide
an alternative treatment for CLL patients with p53 mutations, for whom therapeutic
options are currently limited. Moreover, this drug combination reduces the effective
dose of the Hsp90 inhibitor and may therefore alleviate any toxicity encountered.

to fludarabine nucleoside (2-FaraA), which enters the cell
via several nucleoside-specific membrane transporters,
and is converted to the cytotoxic triphosphate derivative
(2-FaraATP). 2-FaraATP is incorporated into elongating
DNA chains and terminates chain synthesis causing
double-strand breaks (DSBs) [2]. The cellular response to
DNA damage involves networks of proteins that induce

INTRODUCTION
Long term follow up of clinical trials of fludarabine
(2-FaraAMP) showed that drug resistance due to mutations
in the p53 pathway represents a significant challenge in
the clinical management of CLL patients [1]. 2-FaraAMP

either apoptosis or DNA repair; p53 plays a pivotal role in
mediating cell fate decisions [3]. In cells with functional
p53, DNA damage causes p53 phosphorylation and
accumulation, inducing cell cycle arrest, down-regulation
of DNA repair proteins [4, 5] and apoptosis, thereby
preventing the proliferation of damaged cells [6]. Cells
with mutated p53 (e.g., MEC1) are generally resistant to
DNA damaging agents such as 2-FaraA [7, 8], due to an
inability to down-regulate DNA repair proteins and induce
apoptosis [9].
Previous work from our laboratory has shown
that the Hsp90 inhibitor SNX-7081 synergizes with and
restores sensitivity to 2-FaraA in CLL cells with lesions in
the p53 pathway [10]. Hsp90 is a chaperone that ensures
the correct folding and stability of more than 200 ‘client’
proteins, many of which are oncoproteins [11–13]. There
have been more than 40 clinical trials of Hsp90 inhibitors
against a range of cancers [14]. SNX-7081, a novel Hsp90
inhibitor developed by Serenex (now Pfizer, New York,
NY, USA) is more potent and soluble than geldanamycinderivative inhibitors such as 17-AAG [15]. Our previous
study showed that SNX-7081 can induce apoptosis in
p53-negative MEC1 CLL cells by deregulating proteins
involved with DNA repair and replication, and the cell
cycle [16]. However, despite the promise of Hsp90
inhibitors as anti-cancer agents, toxicity has limited their
use [17]. Synergistic combinations of Hsp90 inhibitors
with other chemotherapeutics can reduce the effective
dose of the Hsp90 inhibitor required, thereby alleviating
the toxicity. Our previous results showed that the Hsp90
inhibitor SNX-7081 has synergistic effects with 2-FaraA
against the p53 mutant cell lines MEC1, MEC2 and U266,
and 23 clinical samples of CLL [10]. In this paper, we
have employed comprehensive quantitative shotgun
proteomics to determine protein changes in MEC1 cells
induced by 2-FaraA and SNX-7081 treatments alone
and in combination. Extensive bioinformatics analysis
predicted changes in the activation states of up-stream
regulators that were then tested by immunoblotting. The
results herein provide an explanation for this drug synergy.

Protein abundances were compared between
control and drug-treated cells to identify protein changes
following single or dual treatments. Differentially
abundant proteins that changed by more than 2-ratio
(p  < 0.05) are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Dual treatment increased the abundance of 189 proteins,
83 and 67 of which also increased after SNX-7081 and
2-FaraA treatments alone. Levels of 94 proteins decreased
following dual drug treatment, 73 and 21 of which
decreased after SNX-7081 or 2-FaraA, respectively.
Overall, 62 proteins changed (43 increased and 19
decreased) across all three datasets. A master list of
identified protein changes is provided in Supplementary
Table 1. Proteins were grouped based on their predominant
biological process, according to the Human Protein
Reference Database (http://www. hprd.org/; Figure 2).

Proteome changes induced in MEC1 cells by
2-FaraA
2-FaraA induced the fewest protein changes in
MEC1 cells, consistent with previous reports of resistance
to 2-FaraA [18]. Overall, 177 proteins changed, of which
126 increased and 51 decreased after 2-FaraA (10 μM,
48  h; p < 0.05) compared with untreated controls.
Proteins with increased abundance following 2-FaraA
treatment were predominantly involved in nucleobase,
nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism
(37 proteins), including the DNA damage protein
TOP2A (12.5-ratio) and proteins positively regulating
DNA replication and repair (SSBP1, 21.0-ratio; SET,
2.46-ratio; POLD, 2.27-ratio; RUVBL2, 2.03-ratio).
Proteins related to cell cycle progression were also
increased after 2-FaraA (SKP1, 14.30-ratio; ANAPC5,
9.87-ratio; PARP10, 7.65-ratio; SEPTIN11, 2.47).
A  simplified radial interaction network converging on
the heterodimer BRCA1 and BARD1, with prominent
MYC connectivity (predicted upstream activation, z-score
= 2.202, p-value = 1.95E-04), is provided in Figure 3.

RESULTS

Proteome changes induced in MEC1 cells by
SNX-7081

In total, 1,596 non-redundant proteins were
identified in whole cell lysates of control and drug-treated
human MEC1 cells. The numbers of proteins confidently
identified were 1,050 in control cells, 1,163 following
2-FaraA treatment, 1,076 following SNX-7081 treatment
and 1,221 following dual 2-FaraA+SNX-7081 treatment.
Variation in numbers of identified proteins between
the triplicate analyses was minimal and the number of
peptides in each LC-MS/MS run was consistent between
the treatments; numbers of identified proteins and peptides
in each replicate, as well as the coefficient of variation
are provided in Table 1. Calculated levels of peptide and
protein false discovery rates were less than 0.1%.

We identified 322 protein changes (140 increased
and 182 decreased, Supplementary Table 1) in SNX7081-treated MEC1 cells compared with untreated cells
(p < 0.05). Proteins with increased levels following SNX7081 included those involved in energy (35) and protein
(34) metabolism. Proteins with reduced levels following
SNX-7081 were predominantly involved in nucleoside,
nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism (48 molecules),
including several decreased proteins that positively
regulate DNA replication and repair (MCM6, 0.17-ratio;
MCM7, 0.20-ratio; MCM2, 0.41-ratio; MCM5, 0.42-ratio;
SSRP1, 0.15-ratio; RRM2, 0.29-ratio; NONO, 0.50-ratio;
XRCC5, 0.50-ratio; FEN1, 0.50-ratio; FUS, 0.49-ratio).

following dual treatment.

Quantitative proteomic analysis of MEC1 cells
following dual drug treatment (100 nM SNX-7081

activated when the dual treatment dataset was overlaid.
MYC, a predicted upstream regulator in all three datasets,
was predicted to be active after 2-FaraA treatment and
inhibited following SNX-7081 and dual treatment.
CCND1 was predicted as inhibited in the 2-FaraA and dual
treatments but activated after SNX-7081 alone. Inhibition
of FAS death receptor and caspase 8 after 2-FaraA, and
activations after SNX-7081 and dual drug treatment were
also projected by the network.

Genes corresponding to all differentially abundant
proteins were mapped in the IPA environment; summaries
of biological and molecular associations are provided

were significantly affected by 2-FaraA treatment, 20 by
SNX-7081 and 35 that changed following dual treatment.

SNX-7081 induced a significant change (0.62-ratio,
p  =   0.022; Figure 4). We also confirmed decreases in
NCL following SNX-7018 and dual treatments (0.33-ratio,
p = 0.004 and 0.61-ratio, p = 0.014, respectively); reduced
NCL levels were also detected following 2-FaraA
(0.50-ratio, p = 0.047; Figure 4). All IPA core analyses
independently implicated MYC (myelocytomatosis
oncogene cellular homolog, transcription factor p62) as
an upstream regulator of proteins changing in response to
each treatment condition. Western blot analysis showed
that 2-FaraA had no effect on MYC levels (0.98-ratio);
SNX-7081 alone and in combination with 2-FaraA
induced significant decreases in MYC (0.29-ratio,
0.30-ratio, p = 0.013, p = 0.011, respectively; Figure 4).
IPA also revealed interactions with cyclin D1 (CCND1)
and predicted its inhibition following 2-FaraA and dual
treatment, and activation following SNX-7081, in line
with our previous study [16]. Western blot analysis
showed decreases in CCND1 following 2-FaraA and
dual treatment (0.90-ratio, p = 0.039 and 0.49-ratio, p =
0.007, respectively; Figure 4). A non-significant increase
in CCND1 was detected after SNX-7081 (1.24-ratio,
p = 0.187). BRCA1 was also detected at reduced levels
following all three treatments, relative to control cultures
(0.72-ratio, p = 0.004; 0.39-ratio, p = 0.023; 0.45-ratio,
p  =  0.047 following 2-FaraA, SNX-7081 and dual

and U266. In MEC2 cells, changes in γH2AX were
3.21-ratio, 1.10-ratio and 6.75-ratio following 2-FaraA,
SNX-7081 and dual treatment, respectively. In U266 cells,
the respective treatments induced γH2AX by 4.5-ratio,
1.0-ratio and 8.3-ratio.

DISCUSSION
We previously reported that the HSP90 inhibitor,
SNX-7081 synergizes with and restores sensitivity to
2-FaraA, by inducing apoptosis in refractory CLL cells
[10], and proposed that this was facilitated by SNX-7081induced inhibition of the cell cycle, DNA replication
and repair [16]. To substantiate these findings, we have
expanded our proteomics analysis to quantitate protein
changes in MEC1 cells following 2-FaraA + SNX-7081
treatment to describe the mechanism underpinning this
dual therapy.

Enhanced DNA replication and repair underpins
MEC1 resistance to 2-FaraA
Cells with mutations in p53 (e.g., MEC1) are
generally resistant to DNA damaging agents such as
2-FaraA [7, 8], due to their inability to induce apoptosis
and down-regulate DNA repair proteins [9]. In the
absence of functional p53, 2-FaraA increased levels of
the DNA damage and repair proteins (TOP2A, POLD1,
SSBP1, SET and RUVBL2) and cell cycle proteins
(SKP1, ANAPC5, PARP10 and SEPTIN11) in MEC1
cells. These increases likely enable MEC1 cells to repair
2-FaraA-induced DNA damage and resist apoptosis [20],
consistent with the promotion of DNA replication and
repair contributing to 2-FaraA resistance.
IPA predicted that MYC was active in 2-FaraAtreated MEC1 cells owing to significant changes in 12
downstream proteins: increases in AK2, CSDE1, GLUD1,
MAT2A, PAX2, POLD1, SLC16A1, SLC38A1, SLC7A5
and decreases in C1QBP, GAPDH and MFAP1. Increased
MYC was observed in clinical samples of B-CLL cells
resistant to 2-FaraA; a MYC-specific regulatory network
was proposed as the mechanism of resistance to 2-FaraA
[21]. Interestingly, Jitschin et al., recently showed

Synergistic treatment increases DNA damage in
p53-mutated human B-lymphoid cancer cells
Levels of the phosphorylated form of the histone
H2AX (γH2AX), a marker of DNA DSBs [19], were
measured following 2-FaraA, SNX-7081, and dual drug
treatment. Following 2-FaraA treatment the levels of
γH2AX in MEC1 cells increased by 1.3-ratio, SNX-7081
induced a 1.1-ratio increase, while combination of the
two drugs resulted in a synergistic increase of 4.1-ratio
(Figure 5A and 5B). Flow cytometry confirmed these
results; γH2AX increased by 1.8-ratio following 2-FaraA,
1.5-ratio following SNX-7081, and 4.8-ratio after dual
treatment (Figure 5C). Similar synergy was seen for the
additional p53-mutated B-lymphoid cell lines, MEC2

charging, that is the loading of specific cognate amino
acids to amino acyl tRNA synthetases (AARS), was also
significantly associated with 2-FaraA protein changes.
Mammalian AARSs have evolved additional domains
that enable them to interact with various proteins, some
of which are implicated in tumorigenesis. We previously
identified changes in six AARS proteins in PI3K-inhibited
colorectal cancer cells, not related to their traditional
roles in protein synthesis [35]. Interestingly, Wei et al.,
demonstrated a novel role for tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase
(YARS) in DNA damage protection [36]. The detected
increase in YARS2 (8.85-ratio) may assist MEC1 cells in
resisting 2-FaraA-induced DNA damage.

that Notch-mediated MYC expression in CLL cells is
important in the tumour microenvironment, contributing
to the metabolic alterations seen in treatment resistance
[22]. The down regulation of MYC may therefore present
a therapeutic strategy in targeting the proliferative
compartment of this CLL. The role of MYC in apoptosis
signalling following DNA damage is poorly understood.
Cross-talk between MYC and p53 is important for
regulating cell fate decisions, but MYC-mediated
apoptosis can also be p53-independent. In lymphoid and
myeloid cells, MYC-driven apoptosis appears to be p53independent [23, 24]. While 2-FaraA did not increase
MYC levels in our experiments, the sustained MYC levels
observed (Figure 4) could mediate apoptosis resistance in
p53-negative MEC1 CLL cells.
The tumor suppressor BRCA1, along with
heterodimer partner BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING
domain protein), functions in a variety of cellular
processes including DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint
activation, apoptosis and the transcriptional regulation of
genes associated with these pathways [25, 26]. BRCA1/
BARD1 localizes to the centrosome throughout the cell
cycle [27] and appears to function upstream of DNA
repair pathways, including the two major repair pathways,
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous
recombination (HR) [28], possibly acting as a sensor for
DNA damage. Multiple studies have demonstrated that
BRCA1 mutantor deficient cells are hypersensitive to
topoisomerase inhibitors and cross-linking agents [29–31]
that damage DNA. Resistance to DNA damage mediated
by BRCA1 correlates with a suppression of apoptosis
[30, 32]. BRCA1/BARD1 was not detected by LC-MS/
MS, however IPA revealed prominent connections with
26 proteins that significantly changed following 2-FaraA,
15 of which also interact with MYC (Figure 4), suggested
that BRCA1 is an important mediator of 2-FaraA
resistance in p53-negative CLL. However, 2-FaraA
induced a significant reduction in BRCA1 (0.72-ratio),
albeit less dramatically than SNX-7081 and dual treatment
(0.39-ratio and 0.45-ratio decreases, respectively), and
reductions in BRCA1 would render MEC1 cells more
susceptible to DNA damage-related death. The 1.3-ratio
increase in γH2AX levels in 2-FaraA-treated MEC1 cells
suggests that some DNA damage occurs but is limited by
enhanced DNA repair. BRCA1 is therefore unlikely to be
a principal mediator of 2-FaraA resistance in MEC1 cells.
IPA also predicted an association between 2-FaraAinduced changes and the protein ubiquitination pathway
(increases in ANAPC5, B2M, DNAJB11, PSMA4,
PSMB1, PSMD12, SKP1, TCEB1, UBE2V1, USP15,
USP47, decreases in PSMC6, PSMD7 and USP39). There
is mounting evidence that ubiquitin family members are
also strong regulators of DNA repair in chemo-resistant
cancer cells [33], through mechanisms such as nucleotide
excision repair, post-replication repair and HR [34]. tRNA

HSP90 inhibition by SNX-7081 decreases DNA
repair proteins alone and in combination with
2-FaraA
Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone required for
the folding and function of multiple signaling proteins
that promote growth and survival in cancer cells. We
previously reported that Hsp90-inhibition in MEC1 cells
reduces the levels of cell cycle proteins, proteins involved
in DNA replication and repair, RNA processing and
regulation of transcription and translation [16]. Using an
alternative quantitative mass spectroscopy approach, we
have detected increases in chaperones (HSPH1, HSPB1,
DNAJB1) as well as decreases in nuclear pore proteins
(NUP50, NUP93, NUP155), DNA replication licensing
factors (MCM2, MCM6, MCM7), RNA helicase protein,
SNRNP200 and ribosome biogenesis factor, NOL11,
following SNX-7081 treatment. The signal transduction
protein, PRKDC, showed a major decrease (0.0030-ratio)
after SNX-7081. PRKDC is a DNA-dependent serine/
threonine-protein kinase (DNA-PK) that acts as a
molecular sensor of DNA damage [37] and assembly of
the DNA-PK complex at DNA strand breaks is required
for the NHEJ ligation step [38]. X-ray repair crosscomplementing protein 5 (XRCC5) was also significantly
reduced (0.5-ratio) following both SNX-7081 and dual
treatment. The XRCC5/6 dimer stabilizes broken DNA
ends, an important step in DNA NHEJ required for DSBs
and V(D)J recombination [39–41], and acts as a regulatory
subunit of the DNA-PK, increasing the affinity of PRKDC
to DNA. The disappearance of PRKDC and XRCC5
strongly suggests that SNX-7081 inhibits the response to
DNA damage.
Several proteins that positively regulate DNA
replication and repair were significantly decreased
following dual drug treatment (MSH6, RFC4, RFC5,
MCM6, MCM7, TP53BP1). MSH6 is a component of the
post-replicative DNA mismatch repair system (MMR) that
hetero-dimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha. This
dimer then binds to DNA mismatches and initiates DNA
repair. MSH6 also interacts with proliferating cell nuclear

antigen [42–44] (PCNA; nuclear levels significantly
reduced by SNX-7081 [16]) and is part of the BASC
(BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex)
involved in DNA repair [45]. RFC4 and RFC5 are two of
the five-subunit RFC (replication factor C) complex used
in eukaryotic replication as a clamp loader for loading
PCNA onto DNA [46], required for DNA replication.
Several components of the MCM complex that forms
the replicative helicase essential for ‘once per cell cycle’
DNA replication initiation and elongation in eukaryotic
cells [47], decreased after SNX-7081 and in combination
with 2-FaraA.
Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a key
component of PML nuclear bodies; dynamic nuclear
aggregates are suggested to be sites of epigenetic
regulation and sensors of DNA damage [48]. PML
influences MYC transcriptional activity through a
mechanism that involves control of post-translational
modifications of MYC [49]. The major increase in PML
following SNX-7081+2-FaraA (65.4-ratio) indicates
major DNA damage. Histone H2A family proteins are
important for packaging DNA into chromatin, and have
been associated with DNA modification and epigenetics.
The enzymes, TOP2A and TOP2B, are involved in
formation DNA DSBs [50]. The increases of TOP2A and
TOP2B after the dual treatment (6.51-ratio and 5.98-ratio,
respectively) suggest that in addition to incorporation of
2-FaraATP into elongating DNA chains, 2-FaraA may
increase proteins involved in formation of the DNA
strand-breaks.
SNX-7081 and 2-FaraA synergy is further
supported by the observed changes in γH2AX levels.
Phosphorylation of H2AX on serine 139 is a marker of
DNA DSBs [51]. We demonstrated a significant increase in
γH2AX in MEC1 cells treated with SNX-7081+2-FaraA,
compared with exposure to either agent alone (Figure 5A).
These data suggest that some DNA damage does occur
following exposure to 2-FaraA (1.3-ratio increase),
however cells resist apoptosis by enhancing DNA repair
machinery. The high levels of γH2AX in dual treated cells
supports the hypothesis that SNX-7081 hinders the repair
of DNA breaks induced by 2-FaraA, thus prolonging
H2AX phosphorylation. The additional p53-mutated cell
lines, MEC2 and U266, showed similar changes in γH2AX
(Figure 5C), suggesting that this is a general drug synergy
mechanism in p53-mutated B-lymphoid cancer cell lines
[10]. The H2AX molecule was added to the network in
Figure 6; the predicted activation following synergistic
drug treatment supports the findings of increased levels of
phosphorylation.
There are some differences between significant
proteins identified here, and those previously reported
[16]. This includes, but is not restricted to, the nonsignificant increase of CCND1 following SNX-7081
here. This, and others may be explained by several factors

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

including the whole cell proteome analysis approach
employed here, as opposed to the sub-cellular proteome
analyses conducted before. Whole cell analyses do not
resolve changes in protein levels due to shuttling between
subcellular compartments. Perhaps of more consequence,
MEC1 cells were treated with a low SNX-7081 dose here
(100 nM), compared to treatment at the IC50 (500 nM) as
before.

Hsp90 inhibition suppresses MYC and causes
NFkB2 p100 accumulation
The transcription factor MYC is involved in cell
proliferation and apoptosis and plays a direct role in
the control of DNA replication. The decrease of MYC
might contribute to decreased DNA repair and replication
capacity of Hsp90-inhibited cells. Significant changes in
15 proteins had predicted upstream regulation by MYC;
Western blot analysis confirmed that MYC is reduced
following HSP90 inhibition alone or in combination with
2-FaraA (see Figure 4). Reduced MYC was also reported
following Hsp90 inhibition of neuroblastoma and prostate
cancer cells, with suppression of the malignant phenotype
and augmentation of chemotherapy response, respectively
[52, 53]. We previously showed that SNX-7081 modulates
a number of proteins at the mRNA level (PCNA, MCM2,
Nup155, Hsp70, GRP78, PDIA6, and HLA-DR) [16],
that might be caused by a deregulation of gene expression
and mRNA methylation as a consequence of MYC
destabilization [54].
Nuclear factor-kappa-B p100 subunit (NFkB2)
was identified as a MYC repression target; MYC
appears to regulate both basal and stimulated NFkB2
transcription. In Eμ-MYC transgenic mice, where MYC
overexpression drives B-cell lymphoma, NFκB2 loss
accelerates tumor development by impairing MYCdependent apoptosis, highlighting the tumor suppressor
function of the non-canonical NFκB pathway [55].
The NFκB signaling  cascade can be divided into two
pathways depending on how active homo-/heterodimers
are produced. In the non-canonical (alternative) NFκB
pathway, activation is achieved by inducing posttranslational processing of p100 to the p52 subunit. Here,
p100 is phosphorylated, leading to poly-ubiquitination
and proteasomal processing to p52, which forms the
transcriptionally active p52/RelB dimer [56]. NFκB2
appears to have dual functions, including cytoplasmic
retention of attached NF-kB proteins by p100 and
generation of p52 by a co-translational processing.
Inactive NFkB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm
due to their interaction with inhibitory proteins, including
NFkB p100. In lymphoma cells, the accumulation of
p105 and p100 is essential for the induction of apoptosis
produced by proteasome inhibition [57]. The Hsp90
inhibitor, NVP-AUY922-AG decreased transcription of

combination with 2-FaraA significantly reduced NCL
levels, measured by mass spectrometry and Western blot
(see Figure 4), potentially sensitizing MEC1 cells to Fasinduced apoptosis. NCL levels also decreased following
2-FaraA as measured by Western blot (Figure  4),
implicating other intermediary and/or regulatory
molecules in MEC1 resistance to 2-FaraA.

NFkB target genes, and this effect was maintained for
synergistic dual treatment with 2-FaraA of primary CLL
cells [58]. We detected significant increases in NFkB2
p100 after SNX-7081 and dual treatment, confirmed by
Western blot (Figure 4). Interestingly, we also detected a
significant, concomitant decrease in NFkB2 p52 subunit
following SNX-7081 (Figure 4), implicating an HSP90related inhibition of p100 proteasome processing and
accumulation of the apoptosis-inducing p100 subunit.
NFkB2 interacts with nucleolin (NCL), a highly
conserved, ubiquitous, anti-apoptotic protein that is
expressed by exponentially growing eukaryotic cells [59].
NCL is also involved in regulating multiple apoptosisrelated molecules [60] and is a novel modulator of the
Fas death receptor in human lymphomas, effectively
blocking Fas signaling [61]. Hsp90 was previously shown
to stabilize NCL [62] and further, NCL knockdown can
inhibit DNA-PK phosphorylation, thereby reducing DNA
DSB repair [59]. Here, Hsp90 inhibition alone and in

Simplified mechanism for synergic killing of
MEC1 cells
A simplified interaction network, presented in
Figure 6, details the proposed mechanism of 2-FaraA
and SNX-7081 synergistic killing of p53-negative MEC1
cells. Accumulating DNA damage, indicated by the
synergistic increase in γH2AX levels, is accentuated by
SNX-7081-mediated inhibition of DNA repair, resulting
in the enhanced induction of apoptosis previously reported
[10]. Our data suggest that DNA damage is compounded

by the loss of multiple DNA damage response molecules,
including checkpoint regulators BRCA1 and CCND1,
and cell death is triggered following a loss of MYC and
NCL and an accumulation of NFkB2 p100. Loss of NCL
can activate Fas-mediated apoptosis, leading to increases
in pro-apoptotic proteins BID and fas-associated factor
2 (FAF2). While observed changes in BRCA1, CCND1,
MYC, NCL, NFkB2 p100, BID and FAF2 correlate
well with the known functions of these proteins, further
delineation of the causes and effects of each modulated
protein is required.

h. Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels were washed
and each lane was cut into 16 equal pieces, each piece
then sliced finely and transferred to a 96-well plate. Gel
fragments were de-stained with 100 mM NH4HCO3, and
dehydrated with acetonitrile (ACN, 50% v/v) in 100 mM
NH4HCO3 for 10 min, then 100% ACN for 10 min before
air drying. The samples were reduced with 10 mM DTT
at 37°C for 1 h, followed by alkylation in the dark with
50 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 1 h. The
samples were then washed and dehydrated and air-dried
as before. Samples were rehydrated with sequencing grade
trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at a trypsin to
protein ratio of 1:10 for 30 min on ice and then allowed to
digest overnight (37°C). Peptide mixtures were extracted
twice with ACN (50% v/v) in 2% formic acid, dried by
vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted with 2% formic
acid in H2O.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and drug treatment
The CLL cell lines, MEC1 and MEC2, have a
deletion in the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p-), the
locus for p53, with an N-terminal truncation mutation
in the other allele. These cell lines are therefore suitable
models for testing drugs for the treatment of p53 mutant
CLL [63]. The human U266 myeloma cell line has a
mutation in p53 at codon 161 [64]. Human MEC1,
MEC2, and U266 cells were grown in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and
50 μg/mL gentamicin at 37°C. Cells were grown in
exponential phase and treated with drugs at a density of
3 × 105 cells/ml. SNX-7081 (a kind gift from Prof. Lee
Graves, Department of Pharmacology, University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA) and/or 2-FaraA
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were dissolved in
DMSO. From previous experiments, combining 2-FaraA
(10 μM, 48 h) and SNX-7081 (100 nM, 48 h) gave the
greatest effect against B-lymphoid MEC1, MEC2 and
U266 cells [10]. Triplicate cultures of MEC1 cells were
treated: control (DMSO, 48 h), 2-FaraA (10 μM, 48 h),
SNX-7081 (100 nM, 48 h), 100 nM SNX-7081 + 10 μM
2-FaraA (48 h). Control cultures were incubated with the
same amount of DMSO as a vehicle control.

Nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry
As previously described [65], peptides were
analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS using a LTQ-XL ion-trap
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose,
CA, USA). Reverse phase columns were packed inhouse to approximately 7 cm (100 μm i.d.) using 100 Å,
5 μm Zorbax C18 resin (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) in a fused silica capillary with an
integrated electrospray tip. A 1.8 kV electrospray voltage
was applied via a liquid junction up-stream of the C18
column. Samples were injected onto the C18 column
using a Surveyor autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
followed by an initial wash with buffer A (5% (v/v) ACN,
0.1% (v/v) formic acid) for 10 min at 1 μL/min. Peptides
were eluted from the C18 column with 0%-50% Buffer
B (95% (v/v) ACN, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) over 58 min
at 500 nL/min followed by 50–95% Buffer B over 5 min
at 500 nL/min. The eluted solution was directed into the
nanospray ionization source of the mass spectrometer.
Spectra were scanned over the range 400–1500 amu, with
automated peak recognition, a dynamic exclusion window
set to 90 s and tandem MS of the top 6 most intense
precursor ions at 35% normalization collision energy
using Xcalibur software (version 2.06; Thermo Fisher
Scientific).

Protein extraction, SDS-PAGE separation and
in-gel tryptic digestion
MEC1 cells were collected from triplicate cultures
(see above) by centrifugation (350 x g, 5 min, 4°C) and
lysed in protein extraction buffer (5 M urea, 2 M thiourea,
2% w/v CHAPS, 2% w/v sulfobetaine 3–10, 40 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.8), 1.0% v/v carrier ampholyte, 65 mM DTT,
2 mM tributylphosphine). The lysate was centrifuged
(10,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C) and the supernatant purified by
precipitation (Ready Prep 2-D Clean-up Kit, Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and re-suspended in 8
M urea. Protein concentrations were determined (2D Quant
Kit, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire,
UK) and 200 μg samples were diluted in sample buffer

Protein identification and data processing
MS/MS raw data files were converted to mzXML
format and processed through the global proteome machine
(GPM) software using version 2.1.1 of the X!Tandem
algorithm (http://www.thegpm.org). For each experiment,
the 16 fractions were processed sequentially with output
files for each fraction, and a merged, non-redundant output
file was generated for protein identifications with log(e)
values less than -1. Tandem mass spectra were searched

against the NCBI human protein database in the Global
Proteome Machine containing 513,692 protein sequences.
The database also incorporated common human and trypsin
peptide contaminants. Search parameters included MS and
MS/MS tolerances of ± 2 Da and ± 0.2 Da, respectively and
up to three missed tryptic cleavages and K/R-P cleavages.
Fixed modifications were set for carbamidomethylation of
cysteine and variable modifications were set for oxidation
of methionine. Triplicate GPM protein identification files
were combined into one joint dataset to produce a single
shotgun proteomic analysis for each condition. Only
proteins identified in all replicates were retained in the
final dataset for each condition. To enhance confidence,
a total spectral count of at least six was required within at
least one condition.

i.	 Highly predicted or experimentally observed
confidence levels;
ii.	 Species, mammals with stringent filtering;
iii.	Restricted to immune cells, bone marrow
cells, stem cells, immune cell lines, leukemia cell lines,
lymphoma cell lines and other cells not otherwise

A large comparative analysis was performed to
identify common pathways, nodes and/or regulators
between the different drug treatments. Using the Path
Explorer tool and predicted up-stream regulators, we
built a representative interaction network in the IPA
environment by expanding known direct and indirect
connections between significant targets from all three
datasets. Molecules representing HSP-90 and the DNAstrand break marker, H2AX (gene name, H2AFX) were
added and connected to the network using the IPA
knowledgebase. All datasets were then overlaid in turn and
activation states were predicted.

Quantitative proteomics and statistical analyses
Protein abundance data were calculated based on
normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) values
[66] and following the workflow and software previously
described [67]. For each sample, i, the number of spectral
counts (SpC) identifying a protein, k, was divided by
the molecular weight of the protein in kDa. (SpC/MW)k
values were then divided by the sum of (SpC/MW) for
all (N) proteins in the experiments to give the NSAFi
values. For each protein k, the sumS of all spectral counts
obtained from the triplicate values was calculated, and
the corresponding NSAFSvalues were deduced and used
as a measure of protein abundance. A spectral fraction
of 0.5 was added to the spectral counts of each protein,
to compensate for null values [68] and enable logtransformation for subsequent statistical analyses. Twotailed t-tests assuming equal variance were performed on
log2-transformed NSAF data to identify significant protein
changes following each treatment, where p < 0.05 was
regarded as significant. Proteins that had a ratio of change
greater than 2, or less than 0.5 were analyzed further.

Western blot analyses
Triplicate MEC1 protein samples (15 μg) from
each condition were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and
transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immun-Blot™, Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). After blocking with 5%
skim milk in TBST (25 mM Tris/HCl, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7
mM KCl and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, pH 7.6), the membranes
were incubated in TBST (4°C, 16 h) with rabbit monoclonal
antibodies against BRCA1, NCL, NFKB2 p100/p52 or
MYC (Cell Signalling Technology, Danvers, USA) or mouse
monoclonal antibody against CCND1 (Cell Signalling
Technology) and actin (Abcam, Cambridge, USA), followed
by incubation (1 h, room temperature) with horse radish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies: goatanti-mouse-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) or donkey-anti-rabbit-HRP (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). Proteins were visualized using Rapid Step
ECL Reagent (Merck, Kilsyth, Victoria, Australia) and ECL
chemiluminescence film (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont,
Buckinghamshire, UK). Films were scanned on a Molecular
Imager GS-800™ densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). Bands were quantified using ImageQuantTL
density analysis software (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont,
Buckinghamshire, UK) and two-tailed homoscedastic
student t-tests were performed on log2-transformed, actinnormalized ratios to the control samples.

Bioinformatics
Biological and canonical functions of differentially
abundant proteins across the three datasets were
explored using Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA)
software (Ingenuity Systems, http://analysis.ingenuity.
com). This software program calculates the probability
that the genes associated with our datasets (right-tailed
Fisher’s Exact Test) are involved in particular pathways,
compared with the total number of occurrences of
those proteins in all functional annotations stored in
the Ingenuity Knowledgebase. Significant proteins >
2-ratio or < 0.5-ratio; p < 0.05) were uploaded into the
IPA environment and core analyses were performed to
identify prominent interactions and associations within
each dataset, with the following amendments to the default
criteria:

CONCLUSIONS
Quantitative label-free shotgun LC-MS/MS,
employing spectral counting with NSAFs, was used to
investigate changes in protein levels in human MEC1
CLL cells treated with the Hsp90 inhibitor SNX-7081,
the purine analog 2-FaraA, and dual treatment with both
drugs. The data obtained are consistent with the following
mechanism of synergy between SNX-7081 and 2-FaraA:
2-FaraA induces DNA damage, SNX-7081 down-regulates
DNA repair proteins with accumulation of damaged
cells that undergo apoptosis that may be mediated by
a SNX-7081 induced loss of MYC and NFkB2 p100
accumulation. Induction of the DNA damage marker,
γH2AX, indicates that a similar mechanism may operate
in other p53-mutated human B-lymphoid cancers, such as
the cell lines MEC2 (CLL) and U266 (multiple myeloma).
These results provide valuable insight into the synergistic
mechanism between SNX-7081 and 2-FaraA that may
provide an alternative treatment for CLL patients with p53
mutations, where options are currently limited [10]. This
drug combination reduces the effective dose of the Hsp90
inhibitor and could, therefore, overcome the toxicity
encountered in clinical trials of Hsp90 inhibitors.
