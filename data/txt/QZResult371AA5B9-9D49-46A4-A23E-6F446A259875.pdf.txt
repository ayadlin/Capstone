ABSTRACT
The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an ubiquitin ligase
involved in cell cycle. During the metaphase-anaphase transition the APC/C is
activated by Cdc20. The aim of this study is to elucidate the importance and
therapeutic potential of APC/C and its co-activator Cdc20 in multiple myeloma
(MM). Gene expression analysis revealed that Cdc20 was expressed at higher levels
in gene expression-based high-risk MM patients. Moreover, high Cdc20 expression
correlated with poor prognosis. Treatment of human myeloma cell lines with proTAME,
an APC/C inhibitor, resulted in an accumulation of APC/CCdc20 substrate cyclin B1 and
an accumulation of cells in metaphase. Moreover we observed a significant dosedependent decrease in viability and increase in apoptosis in MM cells upon proTAME
treatment. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied with caspase 3, 8, 9 and
PARP cleavage. A similar metaphase arrest and induction of apoptosis were obtained
with specific knockdown of Cdc20. In addition, we demonstrated the accumulation of
Bim was partially responsible for the observed cell death. Combining proTAME with
another APC/C inhibitor apcin or the alkylating agent melphalan resulted in enhanced
anti-MM activity. This study suggests that the APC/C and its co-activator Cdc20 could
be a new and promising target especially in high-risk MM patients.

INTRODUCTION

include the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the
immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide. Nevertheless,
these agents are not curative for the majority of patients
and therefore investigation of novel targets to enhance
therapy is necessary [1, 2].
The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is highly
regulated and controls different protein functions
and processes such as proliferation, metabolism and
apoptosis by targeting cellular proteins for degradation.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell cancer
characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells
in the bone marrow (BM). A great improvement in the
survival of MM patients was achieved the past decade due
to the development of novel treatment options including
novel agents and autologous stem cell transplantation
(ASCT) for younger patients. These novel agents

RESULTS

The ubiquitination process is dependent on ATP and
requires the E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. First the ubiquitinactivating enzyme E1 activates ubiquitin which is then
delivered to the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The E2
subsequently forms a complex with the ubiquitin-ligase
E3 and the target protein. The E3 transfers ubiquitin to
the substrate to form a polyubiquitin chain, targeting
the protein for degradation by the proteasome [3]. The
success of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in the
treatment of MM highlights the importance of the UPS in
this disease. Selective targeting of more disease-specific
components of the UPS might result in more effective
treatment [4, 5]. There is an increasing interest in ubiquitin
ligases as targets since they play a key role in the UPS by
determining the protein to be ubiquitylated and thereby
controlling cell function in a very specific way.
The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome
(APC/C) is a 13-subunit ubiquitin ligase protein complex
that controls the cell cycle. The regulation of the APC/C
is dependent on 2 co-activators, Cdc20 during the
metaphase-anaphase transition and Cdh1 during mitotic
exit and early G1-phase. Binding of the co-activator to
the complex leads to the recruitment of substrates which
will be targeted for proteasomal degradation. Key targets
of APC/CCdh1 during mitotic exit and G1 maintenance
are Skp2 and Ets2 leading to an increase in the levels
of p27Kip1, p21Cip1 and cyclin D1 that are necessary to
maintain the G1 phase [6]. Targets of the APC/CCdc20
complex are the cell cycle proteins cyclin B1 and securin.
Their proteasomal degradation leads to the onset of
the anaphase and mitotic exit. A major regulator of the
APC/CCdc20 complex is the spindle assembly checkpoint
(SAC). The SAC delays chromosome segregation until
all kinetochores become properly attached to the mitotic
spindle, then the APC/CCdc20 is activated [7].
Several studies suggest that the APC/C and its
co-activator Cdc20 could be potential new therapeutic
targets in cancer. Cdc20 overexpression has been
correlated with poor prognosis in several solid cancers
[8–14]. Knockdown of Cdc20 in various cancer cell lines
caused mitotic arrest, cell death and increased sensitivity
to chemotherapeutics and radiation [15–17]. Small
molecule inhibitors of the APC/C called proTAME and
apcin, have recently been discovered. ProTAME is a cell
permeable prodrug that is converted to TAME (Tosyl-LArginine Methyl Ester) by intracellular esterases. TAME
structurally mimics the IR-tail of the co-activators and
therefore binds to APC/C, blocking the interaction of
Cdc20 or Cdh1 with the APC/C [18]. Apcin is a small
molecule that prevents substrate recognition by binding
to Cdc20 [19]. In MM little is known about the APC/C
and its co-activators. So far it has been shown that Cdc20
and the different components of the SAC are expressed
in human MM cell lines (HMCLs) [20]. Our aim is to
elucidate the importance and therapeutic potential of
APC/C and its co-activator Cdc20 in MM.

Gene expression and prognostic value of Cdc20
and Cdh1 in MM patients
We assessed the distribution of Cdc20 expression
in primary MM cells using three gene expression-based
high-risk scores namely the RS, GPI and UAMS HRS
scores [21–23]. In two independent MM patient cohorts
we observed a significant higher Cdc20 expression
in all high-risk groups (Figure 1A–1B). In addition,
high Cdc20 expression correlated with a significant
inferior overall survival in MM patients in both cohorts
(Figure 1C). However there was no association between
Cdh1 expression and gene expression-based risk scores
in MM patients (Supplementary Figure 1A–1B). Low
Cdh1 expression correlated with poor prognosis in MM
in the TT-2 cohort but had no prognostic value in the HMcohort (Supplementary Figure 1C). Next we evaluated the
microarray expression level of Cdc20 and Cdh1 in HMCLs
and observed a rather constant and low expression of Cdh1
while Cdc20 expression was higher and more variable
(Supplementary Figure 1D). Moreover the expression of
Cdc20 in primary MM cells correlated with proliferation
measured as the plasma cell proliferation index with PI
staining (n = 101, rs = 0,416, P < 0.001) (Supplementary
Figure 2).
Gene set enrichment analysis was performed
comparing gene expression profiles of MM cells of patients
with high or low Cdc20 or Cdh1 expression. A list of the
top 10 GSEA pathways enriched in Cdc20 high, Cdc20
low, Cdh1 high and Cdh1 low MM patients can be found
in Tables 1 and 2. MM cells of patients with a high Cdc20
expression showed a significant enrichment in genes
associated with proliferation, while MM cells of patients
with a low Cdc20 expression had a significant enrichment
in genes under-expressed in the proliferation subgroup of
the MM molecular classification (Supplementary Figure 3
and 4 and Supplementary Tables 1–4). Patients with high
Cdh1 expression were characterized by a significant
enrichment of genes related to mature bone marrow
plasma cells and JAK/STAT signaling. Interestingly,
patients with low Cdh1 expression showed a significant
enrichment of MYC target genes (Supplementary Figure 5
and 6 and Supplementary Tables 5–7).

Pharmacological inhibition of the APC/C with
proTAME results in a metaphase arrest and
reduced viability of MM cells
To assess if the APC/C could be a potential target
in MM we used the APC/C inhibitor proTAME. We first
examined protein levels of substrates APC/CCdc20 (cyclin
B1) and APC/CCdh1 (Skp2) after 6, 18 and 24 hours
proTAME treatment (Figure 2A). We observed an increase
in cyclin B1 at early time points. Skp2 levels however

were not affected by proTAME treatment. This suggests
that proTAME may preferentially inhibit APC/CCdc20
activity in MM cells.
Since the APC/CCdc20 is involved in the metaphaseanaphase transition we investigated if inhibition of the
APC/C could lead to an arrest of cells in the metaphase.
May-Grünwald Giemsa stained cytospins of proTAME
treated LP-1 and RPMI-8226 cells were analyzed using
light microscopy (Figure  2B). Quantification of the
percentage of cells in metaphase indicated a significant
increase when the cell lines were treated with proTAME
at each time point (Figure 2C).
As a mitotic arrest can lead to cell death we further
investigated the effect of proTAME on the viability of
MM cells. The HMCLs LP-1, RPMI-8226, JJN3, OPM-2,
U266 and NCI-H929 were treated with proTAME and
viability was measured 24 hours later (Figure 3A).

We observed a dose-dependent decrease in the viability
in all HMCLs. LP-1 was the least sensitive cell line with
an IC50 of 12.1 µM and JJN3 was the most sensitive
with an IC50 of 4.8 µM (Supplementary Table 8). In
addition we tested proTAME on primary samples from 7
myeloma patients and observed again a dose-dependent
reduction of the viability (Figure 3B). The IC50 varied
among the different patients, ranging from 2.8 to 20.3 µM
(Supplementary Table 8). Patient characteristics can
be found in Supplementary Table 9. To investigate if
proTAME influences the viability of cells from the BM
microenvironment, we treated bone marrow stromal cells
(BMSC) from different MM patients (Figure 3C) and
observed that proTAME did not affect their viability.
Moreover we treated peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) of 3 healthy persons with proTAME
(Figure 3D). ProTAME decreased the viability of PBMCs

proTAME is still active in the presence of the
BM microenvironment
The BM microenvironment is an important source
of MM survival and growth factors such as IL-6 and
IGF-1. Here we tested if IL-6 and IGF-1 could abrogate
the effect of proTAME on HMCLs by investigating the
viability of LP-1, RPMI-8226 and NCI-H929 cells treated
with proTAME with or without IL-6 or IGF-1. In all
these MM cell lines IL-6 and IGF-1 induced an increased
survival at both concentrations tested. Although in some
conditions IL-6 and IGF-1 slightly diminished the effect of
proTAME, at higher concentrations the effect of proTAME
was not abrogated by these cytokines (Figure 4A). We also
co-cultured the RPMI-8226 cells with healthy human bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and treated them with
proTAME. Although BMSCs reduced the percentage of

Next we explored if APC/C inhibition could induce
apoptosis in 4 cell lines. A significant increase in the
number of apoptotic cells was found in each cell line after
treatment with proTAME (Figure 5A). This was confirmed
by an induction of apoptosis in primary samples from 3
myeloma patients (Figure 5B).
The apoptotic pathway was further investigated in
LP-1 and RPMI-8226 cells by western blot. We observed
cleavage of PARP, caspase 3, 8 and 9 beginning after
6 hours of proTAME treatment in both cell lines. Moreover,
we observed a phosphorylation of H2AX after proTAME
treatment (Figure 5C). Looking at Bcl-2 family proteins,
no clear difference was observed in total Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and

Mcl-1 however phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was
clearly induced at earlier time points in HMCLs treated
with proTAME (Figure 6A). In addition, Bim was increased
when RPMI-8226 cells were incubated for 6 hours with
proTAME (Figure 6B). To investigate the involvement of
Bim in the induced apoptosis, Bim was silenced in RPMI8226 cells with shRNA. Bim silencing was confirmed by
western blot analysis of cells transduced with a shBim
lentiviral vector compared to shScrambled transduced
cells (Figure 6C). Reduction of Bim expression in RPMI8226 cells significantly reduced the effect of proTAME,
implying that Bim is at least partially responsible for the
observed induction of apoptosis by proTAME (Figure 6D).
LP-1 cells were not investigated for the involvement of
Bim as Bim is not expressed in this cell line [24].

and protein levels. Knockdown of Cdc20 resulted in
a significant induction of apoptosis after 48 and 72  h
which was accompanied with cleavage of caspase 3,
8, 9 and PARP. Moreover, silencing Cdc20 resulted in
phosphorylation of H2AX and accumulation of cells in
metaphase (Figure 7A–7D).

Inhibition of the APC/C with two chemical
inhibitors significantly increases MM cell death
Recently it was described that combining proTAME
with apcin leads to a synergistic inhibition of the APC/C
[19]. We therefore incubated the HMCLs LP-1 and
RPMI-8226 with a combination of proTAME and apcin.
Although apcin alone had minor effects on MM cells,
the combination of both inhibitors increased apoptosis
significantly compared to single treatments (Figure 8A).
We also investigated the combination of proTAME
with 2 important drugs used for the treatment of MM
patients, namely melphalan and bortezomib. The
combination of proTAME with melphalan increased

scores [21–23] we observed a higher Cdc20 expression
in high-risk MM patient groups. Moreover we observed
a correlation between Cdc20 expression in primary MM
cells and proliferation. High Cdc20 was associated with
poor overall survival in both MM patient cohorts. This is
in agreement with other cancer types where an upregulated
Cdc20 expression correlated with a poor prognosis [8–14].
Moreover a recent study shows that MM patients with a
high expression of BUB1b, Cdc20 and CCNB1/2 had a
poor survival outcome in the TT-2 cohort [29]. In addition
we showed that MM cells of patients with a high Cdc20
expression showed a significant enrichment in genes
associated with proliferation whereas MM cells of patients
with low Cdc20 expression have a significant enrichment
in genes underexpressed in the proliferation subgroup of
the MM molecular classification. Cdh1 expression on the

DISCUSSION
Since the outcome of particularly high-risk patients
has not yet improved, investigation of alternative
treatment options of those patients is greatly needed
[25]. High-risk MM patients are characterized by an
overexpression of genes associated with cell cycle and
a high labeling index [21, 26–28]. This gives a clear
rationale to treat high-risk patients with (targeted) antimitotics. In this study we investigated if the APC/C, and
its co-activator Cdc20 could be a potential target in MM.

poor prognosis in the TT-2 cohort but not in the HMcohort. Cdh1 has been described as a potential tumor
suppressor, since elevated Cdh1 levels inhibited breast
tumor growth and depletion of Cdh1 induced proliferation

JAK/STAT signaling whereas patients with low Cdh1
expression showed a significant enrichment in MYC target
genes. From this we concluded that it would be interesting
to target the APC/CCdc20 in MM.
In this study we used the APC/C inhibitor proTAME.
Previous research demonstrated that proTAME is able to
inhibit the interaction of both co-activators with the APC/C
in HeLa cells [18]. Inhibition by proTAME efficiently
induced a metaphase arrest, which is in agreement with our
study. Moreover we observed at early time points a clear

increase in cyclin B1, a substrate of the APC/CCdc20, while
the APC/CCdh1 substrate Skp2 was not affected. This could
be due to the fact that cells arrest in metaphase first by
the effect on APC/CCdc20 upon proTAME treatment making
it difficult to see effects of proTAME on APC/CCdh1. The
lack of cyclin B1 accumulation at later time points could
be because of cells dying faster than they can accumulate
cyclin B1. By western blot analysis we could indeed
observe signs of cell death beginning as early as 6 hours
following proTAME treatment. The observed metaphase
arrest was followed by a reduction in the viability. The
sensitivity of the different HMCLs is variable with
an IC50 ranging from 4.8 to 12.1 µM. The variability
in sensitivity can be attributed to the difference in
proliferation rate between the different cell lines. Primary
MM samples were sensitive to proTAME treatment
with an IC50 ranging from 2.8 to 20.3 µM, comparable
to the IC50 described in HeLA cells [18]. However

non-malignant cells of MM patients and healthy PBMCs
were not or only slightly (at the highest concentration)
affected by proTAME. We furthermore investigated
if BMSCs and soluble components of the BM
microenvironment such as IL-6 and IGF-1, described as
major survival and growth factors in MM, would affect
the proTAME-induced cell death. Although there was
some protection, proTAME was still able to significantly
disrupt MM cell survival in the presence of BMSCs
and soluble factors. These findings demonstrate that
inhibition of the APC/Cdc20 would still be active in the BM
microenvironment, making it a promising candidate for
further preclinical investigation.
As a metaphase arrest is eventually able to trigger
cell death, we investigated the activation of apoptotic
pathways upon proTAME treatment [6]. ProTAME was
able to significantly increase the number of apoptotic cells
in different HMCLs. This was accompanied by caspase 3,

8, 9 and PARP cleavage, indicating the involvement of both
intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Moreover H2AX
was phosphorylated upon proTAME treatment indicating
that proTAME treatment could be associated with DNA
damage. This confirms previous findings that DNA damage
occurs during mitotic arrest with microtubule inhibitors [33,
34]. On the other hand it is described that H2AX can be
phosphorylated during cell cycle progression and cell cycle
arrest in the absence of DNA damage [35]. Since proTAME
is a chemical inhibitor we wanted to exclude non-specific
effects of proTAME. Therefore Cdc20 was silenced with
siRNA in the HMCL RPMI-8226 and this resulted in a
metaphase arrest and induction of apoptosis similar as
proTAME suggesting that the observed effect of proTAME
is most likely mediated by inhibition of APC/CCdc20. These
results are also in line with previous studies in other cancers
where knockdown of Cdc20 resulted in a mitotic arrest and
cell death [15–17].

Figure 8: MM cell death is significantly increased when the APC/C is inhibited with two chemical inhibitors or in
combination with melphalan. LP-1 and RPMI-8226 were treated with proTAME in combination with another APC/C inhibitor apcin

(A), melphalan (B) or bortezomib (C). After 48 hours apoptosis was measured with Annexin V/7AAD flow cytometry staining. Results
shown in each graph are the mean of at least 3 independent experiments ± SD. **means the p-value is < 0.001, ***means the p-value
is < 0.0001 and represents a significant increase compared to single treatments (One-way ANOVA).

A hallmark of cells arrested in mitosis by
microtubule disrupting agents is the phosphorylation
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, two anti-apoptotic proteins.
Phosphorylation of these proteins leads to inactivation of
their anti-apoptotic function [36–38]. It is the upregulation
of cyclin B1 which is responsible for the phosphorylation
of Bcl-xL [39]. In this study, we observed a clear increase
in cyclin B1 and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
followed by cell death upon proTAME treatment
indicating a mitotic arrest. Mcl-1 is believed to be
degraded during mitotic arrest and this process requires
Cdc20 [38, 40]. Since Cdc20 is blocked with proTAME,
this could explain the absence of Mcl-1 degradation in our
experiments. Bim, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2
family was increased upon proTAME treatment. Bim was
recently characterized as a substrate of the APC/CCdc20
complex [41]. The apoptotic consequences of depleting
Cdc20 have been attributed to the accumulation of Bim.
Reducing Bim expression in our cell line significantly
reduces the anti-MM effect of proTAME. This might also
explain why LP-1 cells which have no Bim expression are
the least sensitive to proTAME treatment. Since p53 is a
crucial cell cycle and apoptosis regulator we explored p53
protein expression after proTAME treatment. No changes
were observed in p53 and phosphorylated p53 (data not
shown). Also no link could be observed in the sensitivity
of HMCL to proTAME treatment and their p53 status.
To further test whether the APC/CCdc20 complex is a
valid target in MM, we combined proTAME with another
APC/C inhibitor apcin. Sackton et al. demonstrated that
simultaneously blocking the APC/C with proTAME and
apcin is synergistic, suggesting that targeting several weak
protein-protein interactions may be a good strategy to
block large protein complexes such as the APC/C [19]. We
confirmed this in our HMCLs as combination treatment
with proTAME and apcin significantly induced more
apoptosis compared to single treatments. As previously
described, apcin alone did not significantly affect MM
cell survival probably due to a less efficient inhibition
of APC/C compared to proTAME alone. Moreover, we
evaluated if proTAME could enhance the anti-MM activity
of clinically relevant drugs such as bortezomib and
melphalan. ProTAME significantly increased the effect of
melphalan. However we did not observe a combination
effect with bortezomib. This could be explained by the fact
that proteasome inhibition generally induces an interphase
arrest which would block the ability of proTAME to
induce a metaphase arrest [18, 42].
In MM, vincristine in combination with doxorubicin
and dexamethasone, has been used for relapsed patients
and as induction therapy [43, 44]. However vincristine as
a single agent has demonstrated low efficacy in MM [45].
Vincristine belongs to the microtubule-targeting drugs and
disrupt microtubules leading to the activation of the SAC
which subsequently blocks the APC/C [46]. However

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

their use is associated with known side effects, such as
peripheral neuropathy through disrupting the microtubules
in the neurons. Since this mechanism is SAC dependent,
the sensitivity to these microtubule-targeting drugs is
variable due to variable SAC activity. Therefore, it is
hypothesized that targeting mitotic exit downstream of the
SAC, by for example blocking Cdc20 would be beneficial
[15]. We indeed demonstrate in this study that the APC/
CCdc20 could be an attractive and a new therapeutic target,
especially in high-risk MM patients. This strategy can
influence the proliferation and cell death of tumor cells
without affecting the BM microenvironment. Moreover
it can be combined with a clinically relevant drug such
as melphalan, making it a promising candidate for further
preclinical investigation. Since proTAME is not yet
optimized for in vivo studies, new and more potent small
molecules inhibiting the APC/CCdc20 should be developed
and in vivo validated.

Cell viability assay

Assessment of metaphase arrest

The viability was measured with the CellTiterGlo Luminiscent Viability assay (Promega, Leiden, The
Netherlands) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
The relative amount of viable cells was expressed as
percentage of untreated cells.

MM cells were treated with proTAME and cytospins
(1 × 105 cells/slide) were stained with May-Grünwald
Giemsa (respectively VWR International, Leuven,
Belgium and Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Cells in
metaphase were counted based on their morphology using
a light microscope. For each cytospin, 3 different fields of
at least 100 cells were counted.

Cell apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was measured with Annexin V-FITC
and 7-AAD (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA) followed by flow cytometric analysis (FACS
Canto and Diva software, BD Biosciences) according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

Purification of primary human MM cells and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells
BM samples were collected from MM patients for
diagnosis and research purpose and blood was collected
from healthy individuals after written informed consent
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The
research is approved by the Ethic Board of UZ Brussel
(B.U.N. 143201316382) and the Tumourbank of Lille
(CSTMT102). Mononuclear cells were obtained after
Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Nycomed, Lucron
Bioproducts, Zurich, Switzerland) and purified as
previously described [57]. Primary BMSCs were obtained
from healthy subjects, and maintained in DMEM medium
(Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (HyClone, USA), 10% horse serum (Invitrogen,
USA), 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza), and
2 mM L-glutamine (Lonza).

Microarray data of primary multiple myeloma
cells and HMCLs
For the expression of Cdc20 and Cdh1 in HMCLs
we used the Affymetrix data of 42 HMCLs from the
University hospital of Heidelberg (Germany) and
Montpellier (France). These data can be accessed through
ArrayExpress database (E-TABM-1088, E-TABM-937
and E-MEXP-2360).
We used 2 independent cohorts of previously
untreated MM patients for the association with gene
expression-based high-risk [21–23] and survival analysis.
The first cohort contains Affymetrix data of 345 MM
patients from the University of Arkansas for Medical
Science (UAMS, Little Rock, AR) and is termed the
TT2-cohort [52]. These MM patients were treated with
total therapy 2 [53]. These data can be accessed at the
online Gene Expression Omnibus GSE4581. The second
cohort consists of Affymetrix data of 206 MM patients
from the University hospital of Heidelberg (Germany)
and Montpellier (France) and is termed the HM-cohort.
MM patients were treated with high dose therapy and
autologous stem cell transplantation [21, 28, 54, 55].
These data can be accessed through ArrayExpress database
(E-MTAB-372). Affymetrix probe 202870_at and a cut-off
of 379.1 was used for Cdc20. For Cdh1 the 209416_at
probe was used with a cut-off of 618.8 for the TT-2 cohort
and 243 for the HM-cohort.

Lentiviral production and stable transduction
The RPMI-8226shBim and RPMI-shScr were
produced as previously described [24].

Transfection of siRNA
For knockdown of Cdc20 Dicer-Substrate siRNA
duplexes were used at a final concentration of 100  nM
(HSC.RNAI.N001255.12.1 (duplex 1) and (HSC.
RNAI.N001255.12.2 (duplex 2)). The DS NC1 was
used as a control. All Dicer-Substrate siRNA duplexes
were purchased at IDT (Leuven, Belgium) The RPMI8226 were transfected using lipofectamine RNAiMax
(Invitrogen, Gent, Belgium) according to the procedure
provided by the manufacturer.

The plasma cell labeling index

Statistical analysis

Multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotyping
was performed as indicated [56]. The cell cycle was
assessed using 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
staining (Sigma Aldrich) and plasma cells in the S phase
were quantified using incubation with bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) for 1 hour, and labelling with an anti-BrdU
antibody (APC BrdU flow kit, BD Pharmingen, Le Pont
De Claix, France).

Gene expression was analyzed by the web tool
GenomicScape [58]. Prognostic significance of Cdc20
and Cdh1 genes was calculated using Maxstat R function
and Benjamini Hochberg multiple testing correction as
previously described [59, 60]. Survival curves were plotted
using the Kaplan-Meier method. All these analyses have
been done with R.2.10.1 and bioconductor version 2.5.

We compared the gene expression levels from patients
with high Cdc20 or Cdh1 expression with patients with
low Cdc20 or Cdh1 expression and picked up the genes
which had significant different expression for Gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA). Gene set enrichment analysis
was carried out by computing overlaps with canonical
pathways and gene ontology gene sets obtained from the
Broad Institute [61]. Graphical and statistical analysis
were performed using Graph Prism 5.01 software. For
statistical analysis, all experiments were performed at least
3 times as indicated in the Figure legends. The mean and
SD of the results are shown in the graphs. The one-sided
Mann-Whitney U-test, the student t-test and the one-way
ANOVA with Bonferonni correction were used and
p values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
