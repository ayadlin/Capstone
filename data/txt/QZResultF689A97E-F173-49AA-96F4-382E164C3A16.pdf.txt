Mutations in p53 are a common cause of resistance of cancers
to standard chemotherapy and, thus, treatment failure.
Reports have shown that Tax, a human T-cell leukemia virus
type I encoded protein that has been associated with genomic
instability and perturbation of transcription and cell cycle,
sensitizes HeLa cells to UV treatment. The extent to which Tax
can sensitize cells and the mechanism by which it exerts its
effect are unknown. In this study, we show that Tax sensitizes
p53-mutant cells to a broad range of DNA-damaging agents,
including mitomycin C, a bifunctional alkylator, etoposide, a
topoisomerase II drug, and UV light, but not ionizing
radiation, a double-strand break agent, or vinblastine, a
tubulin poison. Tax caused hypersensitivity in all p53-deleted
cell lines and several, but not all, mutant-expressed p53–
containing cell lines, while unexpectedly being protective in
p53 wild-type (wt) cells. The effect observed in p53-deleted
lines could be reversed for this by transfection of wt p53. We
also show that Tax activates a p53-independent proapoptotic
program through decreased expression of the retinoblastoma
protein and subsequent increased E2F1 expression. The
expression of several proapoptotic proteins was also induced
by Tax, including Puma and Noxa, culminating in a substantial
increase in Bax dimerization. Our results show that Tax can
sensitize p53-mutant cells to DNA damage while protecting
p53 wt cells, a side benefit that might result in reduced toxicity
in normal cells. Such studies hold the promise of a novel
adjunctive therapy that could make cancer chemotherapy
more effective. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4843–52]

(4). Additionally, Tax expression results in loss of genomic integrity
that may arise from the above transcription activities, squelching/
recruitment of phosphatases, activation/inhibition of cell cycle
kinases, and a variety of other mechanisms, as has been the subject
of extensive review (4).
The p53 protein plays an important role in cancer biology because
it is mutated in a majority of all human cancers. Such mutations
account for a significant degree of clinical chemoresistance and are
associated with a poor clinical outcome. Mutant forms of p53 may
have dominant negative and transactivating activities with constitutively expressed p53 protein, and up to one third of cancers with
mutant p53 show no p53 expression at all (5). Several groups have
implicated Tax exerting its transforming effect by functional
inhibition of p53 through mechanisms such as induction of p53
phosphorylation, sequestration of p300/CREB binding protein, and
interaction with nuclear factor nB (NF-nB; ref. 6, 7). The end result
has been a well-characterized inhibition of apoptosis presumably by
interruption of a p53-dependent pathway (8). Interestingly, we and
others have observed an enhancement of apoptosis by UV treatment
in p53-null cells transfected with Tax (9, 10).
The goal of this work is to extend the findings of apoptotic
enhancement to support the feasibility of using Tax as a chemosensitization tool to make cancer therapy more effective. Toward
that end, we have undertaken to confirm the Tax effect in a number
of different p53-null backgrounds, define the spectrum of types of
DNA damage to which Tax will enhance sensitization, explore
mechanistically the proapoptotic pathway triggered by Tax, and
identify a minimal domain of Tax that will exert the same effect as
expression of full-length protein.

Introduction

Materials and Methods

Tax is a phosphoprotein encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus
type I (HTLV-I) that plays important roles in viral reproduction and
in the progression of adult T-cell leukemia (1, 2). Numerous studies
have established that expression of Tax is sufficient for host cell
transformation (3). The exact mechanism through which Tax is
oncogenic is not completely understood. However, it is clear that
this protein possesses potent pleiotropic functionality via proteinprotein interaction and that these activities are manifest as
transactivation or repression of a wide number of host cell genes

University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), human embryonal kidney cells
293T, HeLa, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF; provided by Peter
Glazer, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT) were grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. JPX9 lymphoblasts and
T47D breast cancer cells were grown in RPMI medium with 10% bovine calf
serum. Cells were maintained at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2–containing
atmosphere.
Plasmids and antibodies. Full-length Tax was cloned in His-c-myc–
tagged pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector. pCMV-p53 expression vector
was kindly provided by B. Vogelstein (John Hopkins University, Baltimore,
MD). Deletion constructs of Tax were kindly provided by Ralph Grassmann
(Institut für Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, Universität ErlangenNürnberg, Erlangen, Germany). For E2F1 luciferase assays, we used the E2F1
reporter vector 3XE2F (Panomics).
Expression of Tax protein was detected with anti–c-myc (A-14) rabbit
polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with direct anti-Tax, as
previously described. E2F1 was detected with anti-E2F1 monoclonal
antibody for human, clone KH20 (Upstate), and with mouse E2F1 protein
polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling). Expression of Puma and Noxa proteins

was detected with polyclonal antibodies from Assay Designs, Inc. Bax
protein was detected with polyclonal rabbit antibody (N-20) from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, p53 with mouse monoclonal antibody from BD
PharMingen, RB with monoclonal mouse antibody from Cell Signaling,
and actin with monoclonal mouse antibody from Sigma.
Cytotoxicity and cell viability assay. Fibroblasts were seeded in six-well
plates (3,000 per well). Cells were transfected with FuGene 6 transfection
reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with
cytotoxic agents for different periods of time, as indicated in Results.
Medium was aspirated and cells were fixed for 5 min with methanol/
CH3COOH. Survival cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in methanol.
Colonies were extracted with methanol/SDS and absorbance was measured
at 595 nm.
To measure the cytotoxicity in suspension cells, we used 2,3-bis[2methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt
(XTT) dye reduction assay. Expression of Tax protein in JPX9 was induced
with 10 Amol/L CdCl2. Twenty-four hours later, lymphoblasts were placed in
96-well plates (300,000 per well). Several days after treatment with drugs,
XTT (Diagnostic Chemicals) at 0.2 mg/mL concentration and 24 Amol/L
phenazine methosulfate (Aldrich) were added to the cells followed by
incubation at 37jC for 4 h; the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The
A 450 in control well (without drugs) was arbitrarily assigned a value of 100%.
Mitomycin C (MMC) and etoposide were obtained from Sigma.
For cell viability assay, cells were plated in six-well plates (3,000 per well),
transfected and treated with drugs as was described above. Cell viability
was determined at the indicated time points using the trypan blue exclusion
method. Cells were stained with trypan blue ( final concentration, 0.2%) for
5 min and counted with a hemocytometer.
Statistical analysis. P value for each cell line was modeled separately
using linear regression in SAS 9.1 and comparisons were made on the
outcome measure of cell survival between control and Tax-expressing cells,
both overall and at specific dose levels. In each model, the relationship
between cell survival and cell types was unconstrained such that it was free
to vary by dose level. Overall variation between experiments was also
adjusted for in the model.
Detection of apoptosis. Apoptosis in JPX9 cells was quantified by
staining with Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations, followed by flow cytometric analysis
with FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells (5  105) were washed with PBS and fixed in
cold 95% ethanol for 30 min. After second wash, cells were resuspended in
1-mL PBS containing RNase (50 Ag/mL) and incubated at 37jC for 30 min.
Cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL) in PBS for additional
30 min at 4jC. Samples were analyzed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson).
Immunoblotting. For immunoblot analysis of protein expression, cells
were lysed in NP40 buffer. One hundred micrograms of proteins were
resolved by SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.
After blocking in 5% milk, membranes were incubated with the indicated
primary antibody diluted in milk for 1 h at room temperature, followed by
incubation with the appropriate secondary alkaline phosphatase–conjugated
antibody. Immunoreactivity was detected by Western chemiluminescence
protein detection (Pierce).
Luciferase reporter gene assay. For luciferase assay, cells were
transfected with plasmid expressing wild-type (wt) or the indicated Tax
deletions. After 24 h, the cells were cotransfected with the E2F reporter
vector. The next day, luciferase assay was done according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation. Luciferase kit was purchased from
Promega.

Results
Tax increases cytotoxicity caused by DNA-damaging agents.
Two previous reports have shown increased sensitivity induced by
Tax to UV treatment in p53-null cells (9, 10). To confirm this
finding, we transfected 293T cells with pcDNA3-Tax wt expressing

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

vector. Due to inactivation by the presence of SV40 large T antigen,
293T cells are null for p53. As a control for the efficiency of
transfection, the same cell lines were transfected with pcDNA-GFP.
Direct fluorescence analysis of these cells 48 hours later showed at
least 60% transfection efficiency. To confirm protein expression,
100 Ag of crude lysate prepared from each transfection were run by
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for Tax (Fig. 1A). Cells expressing
Tax or empty vector were exposed to a range of UV doses, and
viability was determined by crystal violet assay 4 days after
irradiation. 293T cells expressing Tax exhibited a significantly
greater degree of sensitivity to UV than cells transfected with
vector alone (Fig. 1B), consistent with the published data that Tax
expression causes increased apoptosis.
To define the range of agents that show the Tax sensitization
effect, we exposed the tax and vector transfectants to MMC, a
bifunctional DNA double-strand cross-linking agent, measured
after 7 days of exposure. As was the case with UV treatment, MMC
induced greater cytotoxicity in the presence of Tax (Fig. 1C).
Additional agents tested included etoposide, a topoisomerase II
inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cytotoxicity of etoposide was
measured by crystal violet assay after 4 days of drug treatment. As
in the case of UV and MMC, etoposide induced greater cytotoxicity
in Tax-expressing cells. Unlike UV, MMC, and etoposide, Tax did
not induce increased cytotoxicity after ionizing radiation, a
relatively pure double-strand break agent, or vinblastine, a tubulin
poison exerting its effect at mitosis, both measured after 4 days
(Supplementary Fig. S1). These data suggest that the Tax effect is
not universal; rather, Tax seems to sensitize agents that exert their
effect, at least in part, due to replication fork collapse. This effect
was seen in versions of non–epitope-tagged Tax as well (data
not shown).
Tax chemosensitizes p53-null cells but confers resistance on
p53 wt cells. Because 293T cells are immortalized and in culture
for a considerable time, we wanted to assess the Tax effect in other
p53-null backgrounds. First, we analyzed the MMC sensitivity of
MEFs that were either wt or null for p53. We transfected both cell
lines with a vector expressing Tax, and the level of expression was
confirmed after 24 hours by Western blot analyses (Fig. 2A). The
cells were treated with the indicated concentration of MMC.
Control p53 / MEF cells were clearly more resistant to MMC than
control p53+/+ MEFs. In contrast to the resistant p53 / MEFs
transfected with vector only, the same cells expressing Tax
displayed marked sensitivity to MMC. Surprisingly, the p53+/+ cells
not only were not sensitized but in fact were more resistant in the
presence of Tax. The doses of MMC that these delineated
differences were relatively low (25–250 nmol/L) and in line with
published reports that show serum concentrations in patients in
the low nanomolar range (11, 12).
To extend our analysis to a human system, we used a p53 wt cell
line, MCF7 cells. A comparison of the effect of p53 expression on
mediating the Tax effect on chemosensitization was achieved using
selected knockdown of p53. To simulate a p53 / background,
cells were transfected with pSUPER-p53 RNAi directed for synthesis
of siRNA against 19 nucleotides localized at the 3¶ end of the p53
transcript (13). Immunoblotting revealed loss of p53 expression
even after DNA damage (Fig. 2B). These resulting p53-null cells
were subjected to Tax transfection. Selective knockdown of p53
resulted in increased resistance to MMC when compared with the
parental MCF7 cells or control knockdown with siRNA against
lamin A. Introduction of Tax into the p53 knockdown background
resulted in cells that were markedly more sensitive to MMC. As

Tax Induction of Chemosensitization of p53-Mutant Cells

Figure 1. Tax increases cytotoxicity caused by the DNA-damaging agents UV and MMC. 293T cells were transfected with either empty vector or c-myc-Tax and
subjected to UV treatment. A, lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, revealing Tax expression in the transfected cells. B, cells were analyzed
by crystal violet assay to measure cell survival. Cells transfected with Tax were more sensitive to UV treatment than those receiving empty vector. Cytotoxicity
experiments were conducted at least three independent times. C, the same experiment was conducted using MMC. Cells transfected with Tax were more sensitive
to MMC.

in the case of the experiments using MEFs, the parental MCF7
(wt p53) became resistant with the provision of Tax expression. Tax
transfection into cells with siRNA against lamin A had the same
effect as the parental MCF7 cells (data not shown).
As an additional system for analysis of the Tax effect, we
transfected HeLa cells, which are p53 inactivated because of longstanding human papillomavirus infection. As in the previous cell
systems, Tax-expressing HeLa cells displayed increased sensitivity
to MMC (Fig. 2C). We supplied the contrasting p53+/+ model by
overexpression of wt p53 by transient transfection into HeLa. HeLa
cells transfected with wt p53 were able to express detectable p53
protein in spite of HPV infection. These HeLa cells transfected with
p53 became sensitive to MMC. On provision of Tax, these cells
were rendered resistant, again consistent with the data obtained
using the MCF7 and MEF model systems. Thus, in four different
p53-null cell backgrounds, Tax exerts a chemosensitization effect
while conferring resistance on p53 wt cells. These data are
summarized in Fig. 3C.
Tax chemosensitizes some p53 mutant–expressing cells.
Cancers that are p53 mutant make up a majority of all tumors.
Within that group, at least two thirds constitutively express a
mutant p53 protein, consisting of gain of function, loss of function,
and dominant negative mutations. To test other cell lines with
constitutive p53 expression, we first used a Jurkat-derived line that
expresses a non–eptitope-tagged Tax under control of an inducible
metallothionein promoter. These JPX9 cells display constitutive
p53 expression (Fig. 3A). Incubation with 10 Amol/L CdCl2 induced
Tax expression within 24 hours. Concomitant exposure to MMC
induced marked chemosensitivity in JPX9 cells expressing Tax.
No deleterious effect was noted with cadmium exposure alone in
Jurkat cells (data not shown). Not every case of mutant-expressed
p53–containing cell lines displayed chemosensitization in the
presence of Tax, as breast cancer cell line T47D was unaffected
(Fig. 3B). These data suggest that at least a subset of p53-mutant
expressing cells is amenable to the Tax chemosensitization effect.
This is significant because a majority of tumors mutant for p53
express mutant p53 protein constitutively. All data for the cell lines
above are summarized in Fig. 3C.
Tax expression induces cell death by apoptosis. We next
wanted to determine whether the cell death observed in damaged
Tax-expressing cells was due to apoptosis. We analyzed MMCtreated JPX9 cells (Fig. 4A) by Annexin V staining and subjected the

www.aacrjournals.org

resulting permeabilized cells to flow cytometric analysis. A
histogram showing Annexin V staining shows that expression of
Tax alone did not result in a dramatic induction of apoptosis in
cells in the absence of DNA damage. Whereas a modest degree of
apoptosis was seen in cells treated with MMC only, a significantly
increased amount of apoptosis was seen in these treated cells
expressing Tax. To confirm the activation and cleavage of caspase,
an early indicator of apoptosis, we immunoblotted lysates prepared
from similarly treated cells. Analysis of caspase-3 revealed
diminution correlating with increased apoptosis. A modest degree
of caspase decrease can be seen in lane 2, but a significantly greater
amount of decrease is seen in lane 4, in which cells express
Tax. Densitometric analysis confirmed diminished full-length
caspase-3. A cleavage byproduct of caspase-3 was seen only in
lane 4 in the presence of Tax and DNA damage due to a significant
loss of full-length caspase. To confirm that Tax-expressing cells
were actually dead and not cytostatic, we counted trypan blue–
stained cells in parallel to the apoptosis analysis in JPX9 cells, with
cells staining blue counted as dead. Trypan blue staining was
confirmatory of the apoptosis and the cell survival data showing
that Tax sensitized JPX9 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). We
additionally repeated the analysis on all the cell lines from Fig. 2,
showing that the p53 mutants died in the presence of Tax and
MMC, whereas p53 wt cells were resistant. This result was also seen
in all the cell lines that were examined in Figs. 2 and 3, confirming
the Tax chemosensitization of p53 mutant or knockdown cells
and the resistance of wt p53 cells (data not shown for lamin
A knockdown).
To confirm that Tax did not result in cell cycle arrest, we
measured DNA flow histograms on 293T and JPX9 cells (Fig. 4B).
This assay was done at 12 hours of drug exposure, well before any
detectable onset of apoptosis. Both cell lines on Tax expression
resulted in either no change in cell cycle flow (293T) or increased
S phase (JPX9). DNA-damaging conditions resulted in marked
elevation in S phase. These data indicate that (a) tax transfection
does not result in cell cycle arrest in these cells and (b) p53-mutant
cells expressing Tax are able to progress into S phase.
Tax targets retinoblastoma protein and downstream effectors of apoptosis. The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is a
prototypical tumor suppressor. At the cellular level, RB protein
inhibits S-phase entry and cell cycle progression (14); promotes cell
differentiation, inducing tissue-specific gene expression (15); and

promotes cellular survival as a response to various proapoptotic
stresses (16).
The best-characterized targets for the pRB are the E2F
transcription factors (17). The ability of pRB to suppress apoptosis
has been attributed to its repression of E2F family and downstream
of E2F target genes. Disruption of the pRB pathway induces

apoptosis through up-regulation of Apaf-1, which is an essential
stimulator of caspase activity (18, 19).
Deletion of E2F1 or E2F3 protected RB-null cells from apoptosis
(20, 21). Recent studies have identified E2F binding site in the
promoters of several caspase genes, including caspase-3, caspase-7,
caspase-8, and caspase-9 (22). In addition, E2F1 up-regulates

Figure 2. Tax chemosensitizes p53-null cells but confers resistance on p53 wt cells. A, MEFs either wt or null for p53 were transfected with either empty vector
or c-myc-Tax and then treated with 1 Amol/L MMC. Lysates from both sets of MEFs were analyzed for Tax expression by immunoblotting for c-myc. p53 wt MEFs
and p53-null cells were treated with MMC at the indicated doses and analyzed by crystal violet staining to assess cytotoxicity. MEFs null for p53 were more
resistant than wt MEFs. On Tax expression, p53-null MEFs became more sensitive, whereas wt p53 cells became more resistant. B, MCF7 cells were transfected
with pSUPER-p53 to knock down expression of p53. The resulting cells were then transfected with empty vector or c-myc-Tax. Lysates from these transfected
cells were prepared and analyzed for p53 and Tax expression. The MCF7 transfectants were analyzed at the indicated MMC doses and analyzed by crystal violet
assay to measure cytotoxicity. The resultant p53-null MCF7 cells were more resistant than p53 wt cells. Transfection of control siRNA directed against lamin A
had no effect on cell sensitivity to MMC. On Tax expression, p53-null MCF7 cells became more sensitive to MMC, whereas wt p53 MCF7 cells were more
resistant to MMC. C, HeLa cells were transfected with Tax and subjected to crystal violet cytotoxicity assay, and lysates were analyzed for Tax expression.
HeLa cells expressing Tax became more sensitive to MMC. HeLa cells were transfected with p53 to overcome the inhibition of endogenous p53 engendered
by HPV infection. On Tax transfection, cells were analyzed by crystal violet assay for cytotoxicity, and lysates were immunoblotted to measure Tax and p53
expression. On MMC treatment, measurable p53 was detected by immunoblot. HeLa cells exogenously expressing p53 became more sensitive. On Tax
expression, exogenously p53-expressing HeLa cells were more resistant. Cytotoxicity experiments were conducted at least three independent times.

Tax Induction of Chemosensitization of p53-Mutant Cells

Figure 3. Tax chemosensitizes some p53 mutant-expressing cells. A, JPX9 cells expressing Tax under the influence of a Cd inducible promoter were treated
with MMC. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. Tax expression was induced on Cd exposure. The same cells were subjected to MMC treatment.
Crystal violet assay to measure cytotoxicity showed that JPX9 cells became more sensitive to MMC on Tax expression. B, T47D were transfected with Tax and
analyzed by immunoblot and cytotoxicity assay. The cells expressed p53 constitutively. T47D cells remained resistant on Tax expression. Cytotoxicity experiments
were conducted at least three independent times. C, IC50 for MMC was ascertained from the graphs in Fig. 2 and this figure and tabulated in a summary form.

the expression of proapoptotic (BH3)-only proteins, Puma, Noxa,
Bim, Hrk/DP5, and Bik, through a direct transcriptional mechanism
(23, 24).
To investigate the potential role of pRB in Tax-mediated
apoptosis, we analyzed protein extracts prepared from cells
inducibly expressing Tax. The subsequent blots were immunoassayed for pRB. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the presence of Tax in p53null (293T) or mutant-expressed p53–containing cells (JPX), the
level of pRB decreased significantly.
Earlier we observed that the Tax effect was reproducible in other
species and we therefore analyzed the MEFs for pRB expression in
the presence of Tax. In MEFs wt for p53, we detected stable
expression of pRB protein, whereas pRB was diminished in p53-null
MEFs (Fig. 5B). In all these situations, E2F1 was concomitantly
increased on RB decrease.
It is well known that a variety of E2F1 target genes contribute to
apoptosis. Apoptotic activity of E2F1 in p53-null cells and
transgenic mice has been documented in several studies (25, 26).
Therefore, to investigate these downstream targets of the pRB
pathway, we immunoblotted protein extracts from Tax-expressing
cells in the presence or absence of MMC with antibody detecting
Puma or Noxa proteins. We analyzed both JPX-9 cells with the
inducible Tax system and 293T cells transfected with either vector
only or Tax. Increased expression of Puma or Noxa was detected in
both cell lines on Tax expression (Fig. 5C).
To show that other species displayed a similar effect, we
analyzed the MEF p53 wt and p53 / cells transfected with either
control vector or Tax. In this case, blotting was only done with
Puma due to availability of murine antiserum. Again, Tax induced

www.aacrjournals.org

increased expression of Puma in p53-null cells but not in MEFs
cells expressing wt p53 (Fig. 5C). In all cell types that were sensitive,
we detected Bax dimers or oligomers in response to Tax, even in
the absence of MMC, indicating Bax activation.
We previously showed that not all p53 mutant–expressing cells
were sensitized by p53 mutant–expressing cells, such as T47D
(Fig. 3B; negative control in our work). To test the effect of Tax
expression on these effectors in T47D, we immunoblotted for
Puma, Noxa, and Bax with extracts derived from cells transfected
with either vector or Tax. We did not detect expression of Puma,
Noxa, or Bax dimers or oligomers, although pRB protein level
decreased and E2F1 increased significantly, respectively (Fig. 5D).
These data are consistent with the idea that Puma and Bax are
down-regulated in p53 wt cells but up-regulated in p53-deleted
cells and some p53 mutant–expressing cells in the presence of Tax.
Changes of the protein levels of either BclxL or Bcl2 were not
detected (data not shown). These data support the idea that Tax
mediates apoptosis through a common p53-independent pathway
via E2F, whereas the downstream targets of E2F may be cell type
specific. E2F1 has been implicated in death pathways either in a
p53-dependent or a p53-independent manner, likely as a result of
cell type differences as well as heterogeneous genetic and
epigenetic factors (27–29).
Tax1 chemosensitization effect restricted to the NH2
terminus. Tax1 contains several identifiable domains, including a
cyclic AMP–responsive element binding protein (CREB) binding
segment (2–34 amino acids), cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) binding
motif (11–25 amino acids), CPB binding domain (59–98 amino
acids), and PBD (342–353 amino acids; refs. 30–32). To identify the

domain responsible for the chemosensitization effect, we used a
series of deletion mutants transfected into 293T cells. The transfectants were tested for MMC sensitivity as above after verification
of expression (Fig. 6A). The deletion of the NH2-terminal 40 amino
acids (corresponding to the CREB and cdk4 binding site) resulted in
complete abrogation of the Tax effect. To show the specificity of Tax
activity and its location in the NH2 terminus, we also tested other
deletion mutants of Tax in which 40-amino-acid regions were
deleted downstream in tax1, including D99-141 and D320-353. The
99-141 mutant is notable for encompassing the NF-nB binding
domain. In both cases, expression of these deletion mutants
resulted in chemosensitivity (Fig. 6A). In addition, we checked the
response of JPX9 cells expressing a point mutant (R222K) localized
in the leucine zipper domain. Expression of the point mutant
sensitized the cells to MMC to the same extent as wt Tax (Fig. 6B).
Thus, the entire activity of Tax in p53-null cells is contained within
the NH2-terminal portion of the protein.

To show the importance of the NH2 terminus of Tax in the
induction of apoptosis, we analyzed RB and E2F1 expression in the
setting of the different Tax deletion mutants. Whereas full-length
Tax and the downstream deletions resulted in RB diminution and
increased E2F expression, removal of the NH2 terminus resulted in
persistent RB expression and diminished E2F1 (Fig. 6C). To verify
the transcriptional activity of the increased E2F1, we transfected
293 cells with the deletion mutants of Tax, along with a reporter
plasmid with E2F1 sites in the promoter in frame with a luciferase
reporter construct. Consistent with immunoblotting and survival
data, E2F1 responsiveness only occurred when the NH2 terminus
was intact.

Discussion
In this study, we address a major issue in cancer therapeutics:
how to overcome the resistance engendered by a mutant p53 gene.

Figure 4. Tax expression induces cell
death by apoptosis. A, JPX9 cells
uninduced or induced for Tax expression
were permeabilized and analyzed with
Annexin V antibodies. Flow cytometric
analysis showed markedly increased
Annexin V staining in Tax-expressing
cells on MMC treatment. Lysates prepared
from the same cells were immunoblotted
for caspase-3. Densitometric analysis
revealed the most diminished caspase-3
on MMC treatment in the presence
of Tax, and the cleavage product of
caspase-3 was observed only in these
cells. B, JPX9 cells and 293T cells

1 Amol/L MMC and subjected to DNA
flow analysis after 24 h of exposure.
Results indicated that Tax did not induce
an arrest in G1 and that cells increased
in S phase following MMC treatment.

Tax Induction of Chemosensitization of p53-Mutant Cells

Figure 5. Tax induces decreased pRB and increased expression of E2F1 and downstream effectors of apoptosis. A, 293T cells were transfected with Tax, and
JPX-9 cells were either uninduced or induced with CdCl2 to turn on Tax expression. The cells were treated with MMC, and lysates prepared from them were
immunoblotted for Tax, pRB, E2F1, and actin. Tax induced decreased pRB and increased E2F1. B, MEFs either p53 wt or p53 / were transfected with either
control vector or Tax. The cells were then treated with MMC, and lysates prepared from them were immunoblotted for Tax and RB. Tax induced decreased
pRB and increased E2F1 in p53 / MEF cells. C, JPX-9 and 293T cells prepared as in A were analyzed by immunoblotting to measure the proapoptotic proteins
Puma, Noxa, and Bax. Tax induced expression of these proteins in nontreated and MMC-treated cells. MEFs prepared as in B were analyzed by immunoblotting
to measure the proapoptotic proteins Puma and Bax. Tax induced expression of these proteins in sensitized cells. D, the same proteins as in A to C were analyzed
in the Tax-resistant p53 mutant–expressing cell line T47D. Whereas protein level of RB was decreased by Tax, up-regulation of Puma and Noxa was not detected.

In the course of our work on HTLV-I Tax, we have made the
observation that Tax conferred increased apoptosis in p53-null cells
on UV treatment (9). Building on this finding, we asked if Tax could
generally result in increased sensitivity to a range of chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in clinical oncology. Interestingly,
whereas agents such as MMC and etoposide induced increased
cytotoxicity in the presence of Tax, ionizing radiation and
vinblastine did not. This observation applied to all p53-null cell
lines we tested as well as to most mutant p53–expressing cells,
suggesting that the Tax effect may be generally applicable to most
p53-mutant cells. Unexpectedly, p53 wt cells achieved protection
from DNA damage in the presence of Tax, suggesting a side benefit

of the concomitant administration of drug and Tax. We further
show that, in sensitizing cells to DNA damage, Tax triggers a p53independent proapoptotic pathway via increased expression of
E2F1.
HTLV-I is known as the causative agent in progression to adult
T-cell leukemia, and Tax has been implicated as an oncogene with
transforming ability. Tax, when expressed in cells, results in
genomic instability, which is thought to be the driving force of its
oncogenic effect (33, 34). On the other hand, Tax is widely thought
to affect the cell cycle via induction of p21 and p27 and interaction
with cdk4, leading to phosphorylation of RB, RB degradation, and
thus increased E2F1, although the dependence on p53 is unclear

(35, 36). Tax has been proposed to bind to RB and promote its
degradation (37).
Tax has also been shown to constitutively activate c-jun kinase in
the stress response, using activating transcription factor 2 rather
than CREB or NF-nB (38, 39). This would argue against the
importance of the CREB site and in favor of the cdk4 site in the
NH2 terminus.
Thus, Tax has a well-described mode of action of perturbation
of the cell cycle that could explain, at least in part, our findings.
First, Tax is known to activate E2F1 via a transcriptional
mechanism (40), although it is not thought to occur via direct
interaction with the promoter (41). Some suggest a mechanism
through binding of and perturbation by Tax with RB (37, 42).
Second, because p53-mutant cells do not arrest normally at the G1S border in the wake of DNA damage, they then proceed into S
phase in an E2F1-mediated fashion, where activation of the
apoptotic pathway occurs. Tax has been shown to promote
transition to S phase in a human T-cell line (Kit 225) and
peripheral blood lymphocytes through E2F1 (43). By a similar
mechanism, another virus oncoprotein, E7, overcomes p21mediated cell cycle arrest through deregulation of E2F activity by
interacting with RB (44, 45). Kao et al. (46) showed that Tax
stimulated DNA synthesis in the presence of DNA damage but
inhibited repair, thereby activating apoptosis. Our data show that
Tax triggers a p53-independent proapoptotic pathway via disrup-

tion of the RB pathway. These effects have proved to be a bit more
variable, as Noxa and Puma are variably expressed at higher levels,
although terminal Bax activation and oligomerization are common
events among all the cell lines examined.
Unexpectedly, p53 wt cells achieved protection from DNA
damage in the presence of Tax, suggesting a side benefit of the
concomitant administration of drug and Tax. Some have postulated
that Tax inhibits the activity of p53 (47, 48), allowing the bypass of
the G1-S checkpoint and an antiapoptotic state. Our data support
this supposition, at least in part. Whereas it is possible that the
checkpoint is no longer engaged in the p53 wt state in the presence
of Tax, nonetheless some function of p53 is left intact, as apoptosis
is prevented even after DNA damage. Such interaction with
checkpoint control may be governed via Tax interaction with
another kinase, chk2, which phosphorylates p53 and may play a
role in stabilization of p53 in the setting of Tax (49).
The ultimate goal of these studies is to lay the groundwork for
eventual application for enhanced cancer therapy. At least half of
all cancers are mutant for p53, and the most common cause for
therapy resistance can be attributed to p53 mutations. Whereas
most p53 mutants in cancer expressed p53 protein, up to a third
may be null mutants (5, 50). In our study, all the null cell lines were
sensitized, whereas a subset of those with expressed p53 mutants
were sensitized. Thus, it is likely that Tax as a therapeutic adjunct
will not be effective in the setting of all p53 mutants. Nonetheless,

Figure 6. Tax1 chemosensitization effect
restricted to the NH2 terminus. A, deletion
mutants of Tax were transfected into
293T cells. Lysates from the resulting
cells were immunoblotted to confirm Tax
expression. The same cells were subjected
to a crystal violet survival assay in the
presence of MMC. Only the deletion of the
NH2-terminal 36 amino acids abrogated the
Tax sensitization effect. B, JPX9 cells
expressing a Tax protein mutated at amino
acid 222 were subjected to crystal
violet assay in the presence of MMC.
Mutation of this amino acid did not change
the sensitization effect. C, cells from A
were used to assess the effect of the
deletion on pRB and E2F1 expression.
Deletion of the NH2-terminal amino acids
resulted in persistence of pRB and lack of
E2F1 induction. A luciferase assay with an
E2F1 inducible promoter revealed that
deletion of the NH2 terminus abrogated
induction of luciferase activity.

Tax Induction of Chemosensitization of p53-Mutant Cells

even if only effective in a subset of p53-mutant tumors, such an
approach would still have the advantage of being used in a large
number of cases. By necessity, this approach would require the
screening of each case by PCR and/or immunohistochemistry to
both define the type of p53 mutation and determine if protein is
expressed.
Long-term infection by HTLV-I has been associated with longterm risk of T-cell leukemia (i.e., after 20–50 years), raising
concerns that Tax exposure would cause potential for cancer risk
after therapy. This is obviated by the fact that such therapy would
be envisioned for resistant tumors and, thus, in patients with
otherwise short-term survival. In addition, such exposure would be
relatively limited in time. An additional difficulty concerns the
delivery of Tax to the patient and tumor, especially given the
problems associated with gene therapy strategies. Toward that end,
we have begun to map domains associated with both the
sensitization activity of Tax in p53-mutant cells and the resistant
phenotype in p53 wt cells. Preliminary data suggest the possibility
of using actual protein fragments of Tax. Such uses of proteins
would not be especially immunogenic in patients having undergone considerable previous chemotherapy. Most intriguingly, wt
p53 cells (i.e., the healthy cells of the patient) would be protected

under such a scenario, as our data imply that Tax confers
resistance on such cells. Patients would thus suffer fewer side
effects and achieve greater efficacy from their cancer therapy as a
result of an even greater therapeutic window. Such an outcome is
especially important in patients whose tumor has not been
responsive to first-line therapy or who have relapsed with resistant
disease. Identification of the mechanism of Tax sensitization and
protection may also identify new targets that can be manipulated
by other agents.
