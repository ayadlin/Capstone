BACKGROUND: Metformin, an antidiabetic drug, decreases the incidence of various cancers in diabetic patients. Metformininduced inhibition of cancer cell proliferation has been confirmed in vitro but not in humans. Because endometrial cancer is
associated with insulin resistance, the authors investigated whether a diabetes-therapeutic metformin dose inhibits cancer cell
growth in patients with endometrial cancer. METHODS: A dose of metaformin was administered (1500-2250 mg/day) to 31 patients
with endometrial cancer preoperatively for 4 to 6 weeks. Cell proliferation was assessed in patient tissues using immunohistochemical
and Western blot analyses and DNA synthesis was measured in serum using a thymidine uptake assay. All statistical tests were 2sided. P values of < .05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Preoperative metformin treatment decreased DNA synthesis in sera and significantly reduced the Ki-67 (mean proportional decrease, 44.2%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 35.4-53.0
[P <.001]) and topoisomerase IIa (mean proportional decrease, 36.4%; 95% CI, 26.7-46.0 [P <.001]) labeling indices. Levels of
phospho-ribosomal protein S6 and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were found to be significantly
decreased and phospho-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and p27 levels were significantly increased. Preoperative
metformin use caused significant decreases in circulating factors, including insulin, glucose, insulin-like growth factor 1, and leptin.
DNA synthesis-stimulating activity in patient sera was significantly decreased during metformin administration. CONCLUSIONS: An
antidiabetic dose of metformin inhibited endometrial cancer cell growth in vivo, an effect likely due to its effect on humoral factor(s).

INTRODUCTION
Metformin, an oral biguanide antihyperglycemic drug, is widely prescribed as first-line therapy against type 2 diabetes
mellitus. Metformin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases glucose uptake by peripheral tissues, thereby
decreasing plasma glucose levels and eventually decreasing plasma insulin levels.1
Widespread metformin use over the past decade has inspired several population studies that have identified additional benefits of metformin, including a metformin-induced decrease in cancer incidence and cancer-related mortality in
patients with diabetes.2,3 This applies to cancers of the breast, colon, lung, prostate, pancreas, ovary, and liver. In addition
to cancer prevention, more recent studies have indicated that metformin also possesses antineoplastic properties,4-9 such
as improving response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.10 These epidemiologic findings
suggest that metformin is a promising drug for both cancer prevention and treatment and have facilitated numerous preclinical studies regarding its mechanism of action and therapeutic effects. However, quite a few questions remain to be
answered before clinical trials may be initiated.11 One such question is which type of cancer should be included in introductory clinical studies to establish the benefit of metformin use. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that metformin causes growth inhibition in various types of cancer cell lines. However, the metformin concentration used for these
studies was much higher than the established in vivo concentration of orally administered metformin; thus, these in vitro
data do not validate all types of cancer cells as clinical targets. Therefore, additional studies are required to establish relevant study models for the investigation of metformin and its anticancer activity.

Metformin Effects on Endometrial Cancer/Mitsuhashi et al

In the current study, we investigated the action of
metformin in patients with endometrial cancer because
endometrial cancer is often associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes,12,13 and a recent retrospective
cohort study on metformin use revealed the highest risk
reduction was in patients with ovarian/endometrial cancer.14 We validated the use of endometrial cancer as a
study model with a short-duration preclinical study using
surrogate markers of therapeutic effects. To the best of
our knowledge, the current study is the first report of a
prospective study demonstrating the clinical benefit of a
diabetes-therapeutic dose of metformin on endometrial
cancer cell proliferation and downstream targets of the
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase
(AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Between January 2011 and May 2013, we recruited 40
consecutive patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma
who were scheduled to undergo surgery at Chiba University Hospital (Chiba, Japan). Eligibility criteria included
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status of 0 to 1 and normal renal, liver, and cardiac function. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) type 2 diabetes
requiring medication; 2) history of metformin use; 3) an
abnormal blood coagulation profile and/or a history of
thromboembolism; and 4) the presence of mental or lifethreatening illnesses. Five patients declined study participation, and 35 patients agreed to participate in the study,
4 of whom experienced intolerable nausea at a metformin
dose of 750 mg and withdrew consent; this resulted in a
final total of 31 patients.
Study Design

The primary objective of the current study was to evaluate
the effects of a diabetes-therapeutic dose of metformin on
cell proliferation activity and growth-related signaling
pathways in endometrial cancer tissues. The secondary
objectives were to evaluate the metabolic effect of metformin on endocrine factors and to investigate the effects of
metformin on the growth-supporting potential of sera.
Metformin (initial dose, 750 mg/day; increased
weekly by 750 mg up to 1500 or 2250 mg/day) was
administered for approximately 4 weeks until the day of
scheduled surgery. Tissue specimens were obtained via endometrial curettage at the time of initial diagnosis (before
treatment) and hysterectomy (after treatment). Changes
in cell proliferation were determined by immunohistoCancer

chemistry and Western blot analysis of paired endometrial
tissue specimens. Metformin concentrations were measured in surplus frozen tissue and plasma samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Changes
in the growth-stimulating potential of serum were assessed
in paired sera obtained from 15 patients; thymidine incorporation rates in Ishikawa cells, an endometrial cancerderived cell line, were measured in the presence of 2% immobilized patient serum. The metabolic effect of metformin treatment was assessed using a 75-g oral glucose
tolerance test before and during treatment (usually a few
days before surgery and approximately at week 4 of metformin treatment). Pathological diagnoses of endometrial
samples were reviewed by 2 independent pathologists.
The Institutional Review Board of Chiba University
approved the study protocol, and all patients provided
written informed consent before participation. This trial
was registered at umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm (identifier
number UMIN 000004852).
Cell Culture

Two endometrial cancer cell lines, HEC-1B and Ishikawa,
were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium
(DMEM; Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad,
Calif) containing 4500 mg/mL of glucose and 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo), 100
U/mL of penicillin, 100 U/mL of streptomycin, and
2 mM glutamine at 37 C and 5% carbon dioxide. The
HEC-1B cell line was purchased from the JCRB Cell
Bank (Osaka, Japan). The Ishikawa cell line was generously provided by Dr. Nishida (Tsukuba University,
Japan).
Cell Proliferation Assay

Cells were seeded in 12-well plates (25,000 cells/well) in
DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 hours. The cells were
then treated with increasing doses (0 mM-10 mM) of
metformin for 72 hours. The media were replaced every
24 hours. After the addition of AlamarBlue reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), the plates were incubated at
37 C, and colorimetric changes were measured.
(3H)Thymidine Incorporation Assay

Ishikawa cells (5 3 103 cells/well in 96-well plates) were
cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 48 hours
until the exponential growth phase was reached, after
which they were cultured with increasing doses (0 mM10 mM) of metformin for 24 hours. Next, the cells were
labeled with (3H)thymidine (1 lCi [37 kBq]/well) (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass) for 2.5 hours and harvested

onto glass fiber filters using the Tomtec Harvester 96
Mach 3 (Wallac Ltd, Turku, Finland). After extensive
washing with phosphate-buffered saline, radioactivity was
detected on the filter using a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta liquid scintillation counter (Wallac Ltd). Thymidine incorporation was expressed as a percentage of that in untreated
(no metformin) controls. Paired samples (premetaformin
and postmetformin sera from the same patient) were
assayed on the same plate in 5 replicates. A geometrical
mean was used for statistical analysis.
Ex Vivo Assay to Assess the Growth-Stimulatory
Activity of Serum

Ishikawa cells (96-well plates; 5 3 103 cells/well) were
cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 12 hours
and cultured for 72 hours in assay media in which 2% immobilized patient serum replaced 10% FBS. At the end of
the experiments, the cells were treated as described above,
and the number of viable cells and (3H)thymidine incorporation were calculated. A concentration of 2% was
determined by preliminary experiments to maximize the
difference between premetaformin and postmetformin
treatments. Use of 5% serum increased the absolute number of cells and thymidine incorporation but decreased
the differences.
Reagents

The antibodies for phospho-AMPKa (Thr172; #2535),
AMPKa (#2603), phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (phospho-rpS6) (Thr389; #2215), rpS6 (#2217), phosphop44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2; Thr202/Tyr204; #4370), p44/
42 MAPK (ERK1/2; #9102), cyclin D1 (#2922), p27
(#2552), and b-actin (#4967) were all purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology Inc (Danvers, Mass). Antibodies against topoisomerase IIa (sc-56805) were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, Calif). Antibodies against Ki-67 (M7240) were purchased from Dako
Denmark A/S (Glostrup, Denmark).
Immunohistochemical Analysis

Cell proliferation in endometrial cancer tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67 (positive during all cell cycle stages except for G0)15 and
topoisomerase IIa (positive during S-/G2/M-phase).16,17
Three-lm thick sections were briefly microwaved in
10 mM of citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and immunostained for
Ki-67 and topoisomerase IIa. The Envision FLEX system
(K8000; Dako Denmark A/S) was used for each antibody
to observe the immunostaining using an Autostainer
S3400 (Dako Denmark A/S). The primary antibodies
were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes at a
2988

dilution of 1:100. The secondary antibody (Envision
FLEX/HRP; Dako Denmark A/S) was incubated at room
temperature for 60 minutes, and 3,30 -diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (Dako Denmark A/S) was used as a
chromogen. The samples were then counterstained with
hematoxylin. Labeling indices for Ki-67 and topoisomerase IIa were presented as the percentage of immunoreactive nuclei of 500 tumor cells.
Endometrial cancer specimens embedded in paraffin
blocks were retrospectively collected from 10 patients
with endometrioid adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery at Chiba University Hospital. Paired specimens
obtained at the time of preoperative biopsy and at surgery
were stained for Ki-67 and topoisomerase IIa. These
patients did not receive metformin, and these specimens
were used only to assess the natural change of proliferation
markers between 2 intervals.
Western Blot Analysis

Frozen tissue samples were thawed on ice, homogenized
using a TissueRuptor (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and
lysed in Complete-M lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science,
Tokyo, Japan) containing Halt phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Wayne, Mich).
Lysates (10 lg of protein) were resolved by 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare
Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies were the same as those
used for immunohistochemical analyses. The primary
antibodies were diluted (1:2000 for phospho-ERK1/2 and
ERK1/2; 1:1000 for phospho-rpS6, rpS6, cyclin D, and
p27; and 1:5000 for b-actin) and incubated overnight at
4 C. The secondary antibody (enhanced chemiluminescence [ECL] horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit
immunoglobulin G and antimouse immunoglobulin G;
GE Healthcare) was incubated at room temperature for
60 minutes. Signals were detected using the ECL Plus or
ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (GE
Healthcare). Signal intensity was quantified using a densitometer (CS Analyzer version 3.0 software; ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and normalized to b-actin levels.
Metformin Concentration in Patient Tissues

Tissue homogenates and plasma samples were deproteinized using methanol and subjected to liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Liquid
chromatography was performed at ambient temperature
using the Shimazu Prominence LC system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Kyoto, Japan) with Capcell Pak columns (5 lm, 50 3 2 mm; Shiseido Co Ltd, Tokyo,

of  25 (mean, 28; range, 18-42), and 20 patients (65%)
were insulin-resistant, as indicated by a homeostasis model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-R) score of 2.5
(mean score, 3.2; range, 0.6-9.8). Nineteen patients
(61%) had abnormal glucose tolerance, including 5
patients with a BMI < 25 and 6 patients with a HOMAR < 2.5.
Cell Proliferation in Endometrial Cancer Tissues

Preoperative metformin treatment resulted in significantly reduced Ki-67 expression in 28 patients (90%)
(labeling index reduced from 51.0 [95% CI, 42.9-59.1]
to 30.3 [95% CI, 21.4-39.3]; P < .001) and reduced topoisomerase IIa expression in 25 patients (81%) (labeling
index reduced from 49.9 [95% CI, 41.4-58.4] to 28.5
[95% CI, 23.0-34.0]; P < .001) (Fig. 1A-F). This corresponded to a mean proportional decrease of 44.2% in the
Ki-67 labeling index (95% CI, 35.4-53.0) and 36.4% in
the topoisomerase IIa labeling index (95% CI, 26.746.0). To confirm this finding was not the result of a natural change between 2 sampling intervals, we conducted a
supplemental retrospective analysis on 10 additional
patients who were not administered metformin. No significant changes in either Ki-67 or topoisomerase IIa
expression were found (Table 2).
Using samples from 15 patients, we then examined
changes in 2 cell signaling pathways through which metformin reportedly inhibits cell proliferation: AMPK/mTOR/
rpS6 and MAPK pathways.4,5,18 Metformin administration resulted in significantly increased phospho-AMPK levels (mean proportional increase of 113.2%; 95% CI, 13.6212.8 [P 5 .03]) and significantly decreased phospho-rpS6
levels (mean proportional decrease of 53.2%; 95% CI,
36.8-69.5 [P 5 .002]) (Fig. 2A-B). In addition, metformin
significantly decreased phosphorylated extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK1/2) levels (mean proportional
decrease of 65.8%; 95% CI, 45.6-95.9 [P 5 .002]),
thereby activating p27 (mean proportional increase of
59.0%; 95% CI, 12.5-105.5 [P 5 .02]) and inhibiting
cyclin D1 (mean proportional decrease of 20.9%; 95% CI,
17.1-58.9 [P 5 .67]) (Fig. 2C-E).
Tissue Metformin Concentrations In Vivo

After preoperative oral administration of 3 doses of
750 mg each of metformin daily for 4 to 9 weeks, plasma
concentrations on the day of the second oral glucose tolerance test were 1.7 lM and 6.8 to 18.1 lM before and 2

Growth-Stimulatory Potential of Sera

metformin decreased insulin and glucose by approximately 40% and 25%, respectively. In addition, oral metformin decreased the levels of circulating IGF-1 by
approximately 15%.
Metformin lowered the thymidine uptake activity of
sera in all 15 patients (Fig. 4). It is interesting to note that
thymidine uptake remained low even 2 hours after loading with 75 g glucose. Moreover, serum insulin and glucose levels increased, whereas IGF-1 and leptin levels
remained low.

We assessed the humoral factor-mediated action of metformin on cell proliferation. Preoperative metformin use
caused significant decreases in the profiles of circulating
factors, such as insulin, glucose, insulin-like growth factor
1 (IGF-1), and leptin (Table 3). Oral administration of

Using the endometrial cancer-derived cell lines, we
then found that at least 1 mM of metformin was necessary
to inhibit cell proliferation in vitro (Fig. 3B-E), a dose < 1/400 of the minimum concentration (approximately

We found that metformin reduced the expression of
cell proliferation markers by approximately 50%. To our
knowledge this is the most significant difference among
studies that have evaluated cancer tissue growth during
2992

metformin administration.19-21 Only 3 studies to date have
assessed the in vivo effect of metformin on cancer tissue, all
of which were histological studies on breast cancer tissues
obtained by preoperative needle biopsy and mastectomy.
Bonanni et al examined changes in Ki-67 staining in
breast cancer tissues harvested from nondiabetic women
who received metformin (850 mg/twice a day for 4
weeks).19 Overall, the effect of metformin on the Ki-67
proliferative index was not statistically significant. However, metformin administration caused an insignificant
decrease (10.5%) in the Ki-67 index of insulin-resistant
women ( 2.8 HOMA-R index) and a significant
increase (11%) in insulin-sensitive women (< 2.8
HOMA-R index). Therefore, the association between
metformin and the HOMA-R index was statistically significant (P 5 .045). This indicates that metformin treatment is beneficial for insulin-resistant women only when
compared with medication-free insulin-sensitive women.
However, the detected benefits were marginal (P 5 .045),
and multiple testing may have resulted in nonsignificant

results. Hadad et al evaluated tumor cell growth in
patients with breast cancer and reported that preoperative
metformin treatment (1000 mg/day) for 2 weeks significantly decreased the Ki-67 index by 3.4% relative to baseline values.20 However, insulin levels were measured only
once during a preoperative nonfasting period, thereby
limiting interpretation of the results. Recently, Niraula
et al conducted a similar study in patients with breast cancer and reported that preoperative metformin treatment
(1500 mg/day) for 2 to 3 weeks significantly decreased the
Ki-67 index by approximately 8% relative to baseline
values.21
Thus, 2 of the 3 studies of metformin use in patients
with breast cancer demonstrated a significant reduction in
Cancer

the Ki-67 index; however, the changes were subtle and
heterogeneous between individuals. In comparison, the
results of the current study demonstrated a more profound (approximately 50%) and consistent decrease in
proliferation.
This finding may be explained by the differences in
target tissues, clinical demography, and duration of metformin administration. First, the planned dose of metformin in the current study was 2250 mg/day, whereas
previous studies used 1000 to 1700 mg/day. Second, we
studied the effects of metformin on patients with type I
endometrial cancer, a malignancy more commonly associated with insulin resistance and diabetes than breast
cancer.22,23
In addition, endometrial cancer has other advantages over breast cancer as an in vivo study model. Preoperative total ablation of the endometrial cavity is
obligatory for diagnosis; however, endometrial tissue will
regenerate in several weeks, thus providing a sufficient
amount of tissue for repetitive analyses with minimal ethical difficulties. Moreover, total ablation eliminates the
possibility that the pathological diagnosis is skewed
because of limited sampling, whereas in patients with
breast cancer, preoperative evaluation is limited to the
core diagnostic biopsy samples. Given the histological
response and accessibility to tissues samples, we propose
that endometrial cancer is a better-suited model for
window-of-opportunity clinical trials with metformin.
In vitro experiments have demonstrated that metformin inhibits cancer cell growth through the activation of
AMPK and the resulting inhibition of the mTOR/S6K
pathway.4-9 Recent reports have identified the MAPK
pathway as an additional growth inhibition target; metformin inhibits MAPK and increases phosphorylation of
p27, thereby resulting in cell cycle inhibition.8,24,25 The
results of the current study confirmed similar effects of
metformin in vivo; metformin intake activated AMPK
and inhibited MAPK in the endometrium.
There is currently controversy regarding whether
metformin inhibits cancer cell growth directly or indirectly. This is based on experimental findings that the
concentration needed to inhibit cell growth is much
higher (approximately  1000 times) than that expected
in patient sera.11 Supporting the indirect mechanism,
metformin prevented carcinogen-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice through the suppression of mTOR.26
Rather than directly activating AMPK, metformin administration resulted in downregulation of phosphorylated
IGF-1 receptor/insulin receptor, Akt, and ERK in mice
lung tissues. Thus, the findings supported the indirect
2993

Original Article

mechanism of metformin, in which metformin reduces
IGF-1 production from liver, thereby resulting in
decreased mTOR and ERK levels.
To address the mechanism of action, we first compared the metformin concentrations in vitro and in vivo
and found that the concentration in tissues was < 1/400
times lower than that of the minimum requirement to inhibit cell growth in vitro. The enhanced responses
observed in vivo might be explained by metformininduced changes in humoral factor(s). To assess this possibility, we performed an ex vivo assay and found that metformin reduced the growth-supporting potential
of patient sera. Among the humoral factors examined,
IGF-1 and leptin, but not insulin, were factors potentially
responsible for this result. In fact, IGF-1 is known to play
an important role in tumorigenesis and the promotion of
endometrial cancer.27-29 Leptin has also been shown to
stimulate endometrial cell proliferation through the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3), AKT, and MAPK signaling pathways.30,31
Although these findings are compatible with an indirect action of metformin, additional confirmation is necessary because there are several alternative explanations.
First, we estimated the concentration in tissues by measuring tissue mass; thus, we did not measure the actual concentration of metformin in cancer cells in vivo. It might
be possible that organic anion transporter-1, a powerful
transporter of metformin expressed in liver cells,32 may
concentrate metformin in vivo, resulting in a higher concentration than we calculated as a mass average. Another
possibility is that the established cancer cell line used in
the current study lost sensitivity to metformin, for example by no longer expressing the transporter. Third, it is
unknown whether the growth-supporting potential
detected by the ex vivo assay is a true reflection of the in
vivo potential. Further experiments are necessary to define
the action of metformin in vivo.
Recently, 2 retrospective studies revealed that metformin use was associated with improved recurrence-free
survival and overall survival.33,34 In these studies, 24% to
25% of patients with endometrial cancer were diabetic,
and 50% of these diabetic patients with cancer used metformin. Greater than 80% of patients with endometrial
cancer were overweight or obese and were insulinresistant. In this regard, the results of the current study
clarified that metformin reduced levels of glucose, insulin,
IGF-1, leptin, and other factors, an important mechanism
for the management of endometrial cancer.
There were several limitations to the current study,
including the lack of a placebo control. In this study, we
2994

did not consider natural changes in cell proliferation
markers between the 2 sampling times, which were separated by an average 4-week interval. Therefore, we conducted supplemental retrospective analyses on 10
additional patients who were not administered metformin. The results indicated no significant changes in any
proliferation markers between the paired samples from
the same individuals.
Although further studies to identify the humoral factor(s) that may mediate the actions of metformin are warranted, the findings of the current study provide a
reasonable basis for the initiation of clinical trials using
antidiabetic doses of metformin for the treatment of
patients with endometrial cancer.
