Abstract

Author Manuscript

PDZ domains represent one group of the major structural units that mediate protein interactions in
intercellular contact, signal transduction and assembly of biological machineries. TIP-1 protein is
composed of a single PDZ domain that distinguishes TIP-1 from other PDZ domain proteins that
more often contain multiple protein domains and function as scaffolds for protein complex
assembly. However, the biological functions of TIP-1, especially in cell transformation and tumor
progression, are still controversial as observed in a variety of cell types. In this study, we have
identified ARHGEF7, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho GTPases, as one novel

TIP-1 interacting protein in human glioblastoma cells. We found that the presence of TIP-1
protein is essential to the intracellular redistribution of ARHGEF7 and rhotekin, one Rho effector,
and the spatiotemporally coordinated activation of Rho GTPases (RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1) in
migrating glioblastoma cells. TIP-1 knockdown resulted in both aberrant localization of
ARHGEF7 and rhotekin, as well as abnormal activation of Rho GTPases that was accompanied
with impaired motility of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, TIP-1 knockdown suppressed tumor
cell dispersal in orthotopic glioblastoma murine models. We also observed high levels of TIP-1
expression in human glioblastoma specimens, and the elevated TIP-1 levels are associated with
advanced staging and poor prognosis in glioma patients. Although more studies are needed to
further dissect the mechanism(s) by which TIP-1 modulates the intracellular redistribution and
activation of Rho GTPases, this study suggests that TIP-1 holds potential as both a prognostic
biomarker and a therapeutic target of malignant gliomas.

Introduction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

PDZ (PSD-95/DlgA/ZO-1) domain is one of the major structural units that mediate protein
interactions in intercellular contact, signal transduction and complex assembly of biological
machineries (1). Composed of around 80-90 amino acids, this structurally conserved protein
domain specifically recognizes a short region of C-terminal or internal sequence of its target
protein. More than 180 proteins have been identified with PDZ domain in human proteome,
which more often are composed of more than one PDZ or other protein domains and these
combinations allow them to carry out their specific functions, such as protein complex
assembly for tumor suppression (2, 3). Tax-interacting protein 1 (TIP-1, also known as
Tax1bp3 or glutaminase-interacting protein, GIP) is unique in its simple structure, a single
PDZ domain is the only functional and structural unit identified so far in this small PDZ
protein (124 amino acids in human and mouse). This unique structure suggests that TIP-1
might function differently from other PDZ domain proteins. Previous studies indicated that
TIP-1 is highly conservative in amino acids sequence across species (4), its expression has
been documented in a variety of cell types. For example, high level of TIP-1 expression is
limited to the central nervous system in the late stage of embryo development of zebrafish
(4). In mammals, TIP-1 mRNA was detected in most regions of human brain but was
abundant in spinal cord, particularly in astrocytes and neurons. In those cells, TIP-1 has been
located in cytosol, mitochondria, nuclear envelope and plasma membrane (5). High level of
TIP-1 expression was detected in human invasive breast cancer cells and that is important
for tumor cell adhesion, migration and pulmonary metastasis (6). However, the precise
biological effects of TIP-1 and its functional mechanisms have largely remained elusive.
Studies on the small PDZ protein TIP-1 have been largely conducted through identification
of its interacting proteins (7-11). Among around a dozen of TIP-1 interacting proteins that
have been identified so far, it has been reported that TIP-1, together with ARHGEF16,
mediates the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein-induced Cdc42 activation and cell migration (8, 12).

The interaction between TIP-1 and the potassium channel Kir2.3 blocks recruiting Kir2.3 to
the basolateral membrane-associated Lin-7 protein and affects the polarity of the
mammalian epithelial cell line MDCK (7). Other than these functions facilitating tumor
formation or progression, TIP-1 was also reported with inhibitory activities towards the
beta-catenin regulated gene expression and proliferation of colon cancer cells (9).

The Rho GTPases are a family of small (~21 kDa) signaling proteins that act as molecular
switches, cycling between a GTP-bound active form and a GDP-bound inactive form. Once
activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), Rho GTPases bind different
effectors and regulate various cellular processes, including cytoskeleton reorganization, cell
adhesion, cell motility, vesicle trafficking, and phagocytosis (13). Among all Rho GTPases,
Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA are the most studied in cytoskeleton reorganization and cell
migration. The functionality of Rho GTPases is finely coordinated at multiple levels
including activation by GEFs, subcellular localization and effector association. Alterations
in Rho GTPases and GEFs -- Rac1, trio, Ect2, and Vav3 -- have been reported in multiple
human malignancies including gliomas (14, 15).
Malignant gliomas are the most prevalent primary brain tumors and are essentially
universally fatal (16). Despite maximal treatment, patients with grade IV malignant gliomas
(glioblastomas) survive only 12-15 months (17). Glioblastomas are highly invasive, and
irradiation and surgical removal of these tumors are challenging due to the diffuse
infiltration of individual tumor cells into adjacent brain tissue. In addition, invading tumor
cells may be more resistant to conventional therapies, suggesting that studying the
mechanisms of tumor invasion might lead to discoveries of novel therapeutic targets or
prognostic biomarkers.

Author Manuscript

In the present study, we have identified guanine nucleotide exchange factor 7 (ARHGEF7,
also known as beta-PIX), one Rho GEF, as one novel TIP-1 interacting protein in human
glioblastoma cells. It was demonstrated that TIP-1 coordinates the intracellular redistribution
of ARHGEF7 and rhotekin, one Rho effector for the spatiotemporally regulated activation of
Rho GTPases (RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1) in migrating glioblastoma cells. TIP-1 knockdown
reduced the motility of human glioblastoma cells in vitro and significantly impaired the
infiltrative growth of intracranial human glioblastoma xenografts in mouse models.
Correlation of high TIP-1 expression levels in human malignant gliomas with poor
prognosis of the patients further suggests that TIP-1 could be a putative prognostic
biomarker and therapeutic target of human glioblastoma.

TIP-1 interacts with ARHGEF7 and rhotekin
TIP-1 is composed of a single type I classic PDZ domain which selectively recognize a Cterminal S/T-X-V/L-COOH (where X represents any amino acid) motif of its interacting
partners (7, 9, 10, 18, 19). In addition to the highly conserved signature motif, recent
structural studies of the protein complex formed with TIP-1 and its interacting partners
showed that the high affinity and selectivity of TIP-1 also requires a tryptophan residue at
the −5 position to the C-terminus of the interacting proteins (20, 21). Based on this

information, we searched a PDZ binding protein database (1) and discovered three proteins
that contain this unique sequence signature (Figure 1a). In addition to beta-catenin (9) and
rhotekin (10), which have been reported with selective binding to the TIP-1 PDZ domain,
ARHGEF7 was identified as a novel TIP-1 interacting protein. The interactions between
these proteins were validated by immunoprecipitation and co-immunostaining with human
glioblastoma cells. In the immunoprecipitation assays, protein-protein interactions were
detected with both of the endogenous (Figure 1b) and the ectopically expressed proteins
(Figures 1c, d). It was also revealed that all of the three proteins were associated only with
the wild type TIP-1 protein, but not with a TIP-1 mutant containing a dysfunctional PDZ
domain (7) (Figure 1c). Mutations within the PDZ binding motif of ARHGEF7 from
−WLQSPV to –ALQAPV (mutations are underlined) abolished its interaction with TIP-1
(Figure 1d). Immunofluorescent staining of human glioblastoma T98G cells indicated that
rhotekin and TIP-1 are co-localized mainly in the cell body and the trailing edge (Figure 1e),
whereas a significant amount of ARHGEF7 and TIP-1 are co-localized at the leading edge
of the migrating T98G cells (Figure 1f).
TIP-1 regulates the intracellular redistribution of ARHGEF7 and rhotekin in migrating
glioblastoma cells

Author Manuscript

To study the biological relevance of these TIP-1 mediated protein interactions, stable T98G
cell lines with TIP-1 knockdown were developed by using two independent TIP-1 targeting
shRNA sequences. Western blot analyses of total cell lysates showed that TIP-1 knockdown
did not significantly change the overall protein levels of ARHGEF7 or rhotekin in T98G
cells (Figure 2a). However, TIP-1 knockdown significantly affected the intracellular
redistribution of these two proteins in migrating T98G cells, as indicated with the
colocalization studies of these two proteins with Scribble. Scribble is one of the major
proteins that regulate the intracellular distributions of ARHGEF7 and rhotekin in the
establishment of cell polarity (22, 23) and the directional cell migration (24). Coinciding
with the published discoveries (24), co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that dynamic
interactions with Scribble exist for both of ARHGEF7 and rhotekin in the migrating T98G
cells, the protein interactions was elevated by around 2-fold at 4 hours post the scratch
wounding (Figure 2b). Interestingly, TIP-1 knockdown increased the basal levels of both
protein interactions in the stationary T98G cells. However, ARHGEF7 lose the dynamics of
the Scribble interaction with the absence of TIP-1 protein, the protein interaction between
Scribble and ARHGEF7 did not change after scratch wounding with TIP-1 knockdown
(Figure 2b). The interaction between rhotekin and Scribble kept a similar dynamics pattern
in the migrating T98G cells after TIP-1 knockdown even the basal levels of protein
interaction were increased.

Author Manuscript

The altered intracellular redistribution of ARHGEF7 and rhotekin caused by TIP-1
knockdown was further validated with immunofluorescent staining of migrating T98G cells.
In addition to confirming the observations in co-immunoprecipitation studies, the results
also revealed that TIP-1 knockdown leads to a remarkable change in cellular morphology of
T98G cells (Figure 2c). Compared to the even distribution alongside the lamellipodia in
control cells, ARHGEF7 was only located at some isolated tips of the highly branched
pseudopodia in the TIP-1 knockdown cells (Figure 2c). Rhotekin was primarily located in

the cell body and trailing edge in the control cells, but was associated with the leading edge
after TIP-1 knockdown (Figure 2c). Fluorescence intensity for each protein at the leading
edge of migrating T98G cells was semi-quantitatively measured to determine the Pearson
correlation coefficients which have been utilized to measure the colocalization of two
proteins (25). It was found that TIP-1 knockdown increased (by ~2-fold) the colocalization
of rhotekin with the Scribble at the leading edge of migrating T98G cells, but had a
moderate impact on ARHGEF7 (Figure 2d).
TIP-1 regulates the spatiotemporal activation of Rho GTPases in migrating glioblastoma
cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Activation of Rho GTPases, such as RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42Rho is spatially and temporally
orchestrated by selective association with effectors and GEFs in cytoskeleton reorganization,
cell morphogenesis, and directional cell migration (13, 26, 27). We investigated whether the
TIP-1-modulated redistribution of rhotekin (a RhoA effector) and ARHGEF7 (a GEF for
Rac1/Cdc42) leads to abnormal activation of Rho GTPases within the migrating
glioblastoma cells. In the control T98G cells expressing TIP-1 protein, scratch wounding on
the cell monolayer induced a robust activation of Rac1 (~2-fold increase), and to a lesser
extent activation of Cdc42. RhoA activity did not show a significant change after the scratch
wounding at the time points surveyed in this study (Figure 3a). However, in the T98G cells
with TIP-1 knockdown, Rac1 activity was slightly decreased, compared to a robust increase
(>2-fold) of RhoA activity after the scratch wounding (Figure 3a).The increased RhoA
activity also resulted in the formation of strong stress fibers in TIP-1 knockdown cells
(Figure 3b). Immunofluorescent staining of the cells indicated that Rac1 and Cdc42 were
predominantly colocalized with ARHGEF7, whereas RhoA was primarily colocalized with
rhotekin. As a consequence of the aberrant intracellular redistribution of ARHGEF7 and
rhotekin by TIP-1 knockdown (Figure 2), Rac1 and Cdc42 were located to some isolated
tips of the branched pseudopodia whereas the cells expressing TIP-1 protein had an even
distribution of the Rac1 and Cdc42 along the lamellipodia (Figure 3c). A great amount of
RhoA and rhotekin were found at the leading edge in the TIP-1 knockdown cells, instead of
the cell body where these proteins were primarily localized in the control cells.
TIP-1 knockdown reduces glioblastoma cell migration and invasion in vitro

Author Manuscript

To study the biological relevance of the TIP-1 knockdown-caused aberrant activation of Rho
GTPases, migration and invasion capabilities of glioblastoma cells, with or without TIP-1
knockdown (Figure 4a), were studied in vitro by using a Boyden chamber-based system. In
those assays, all the three human glioblastoma cell lines (T98G, D54 and T4302)
demonstrated a significant reduction in cell migration after TIP-1 knockdown (Figure 4b).
Similarly but to a greater extent, cell invasion through matrigel was inhibited in all the three
cell lines with TIP-1 knockdown (Figure 4c). Combining with studies with other human
glioblastoma cell lines (supplementary Figure s1), these results indicated that TIP-1
expression is generally required for the motility of human glioblastoma cells in vitro.

TIP-1 knockdown in glioblastoma cells reduces infiltrative tumor cell dispersal in murine
xenograft models
The biological significance of TIP-1 expression on the motility of human glioblastoma cells
was further studied with murine orthotopic xenograft models. Two human glioblastoma cell
lines (T4302 and D54), with or without TIP-1 knockdown, were implanted intracranially in
athymic nude mice. Brain tissues were recovered three weeks thereafter for histological
examinations. In contrast to the extensive infiltration of tumor cells into brain tissues in the
control groups (non-transduced or transduced with control shRNA cells), TIP-1 knockdown
tumors had a reduced invasion and infiltration into the surrounding brain tissue. Much less
tumor cells (1/3 of the controls) were spotted beyond the tumor border in TIP-1 knockdown
glioblastomas (Figures 5 & s2).

TIP-1 knockdown had minor impact on the beta-catenin controlled gene expression and
cell proliferation in human glioblastoma cells

Author Manuscript

It was reported that TIP-1 interaction inhibits the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin and
cell proliferation in colon cancer cells (9). However, microarray and western blot analyses
indicated that TIP-1 had a minor or moderate impact on the expression levels of a panel of
beta-catenin-regulated genes such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc in D54 cells (Figures 6a, b). This
observation correlated to the results of in vitro and in vivo cell proliferation assays
conducted with D54 and T4302 glioblastoma cell lines. In vitro cell doubling time assays
showed that there was no significant difference in the cell proliferation rate between the
control cells and the cells with TIP-1 knockdown (Figure 6c). Cell proliferation in the tumor
sections recovered from the animal models was detected with immunostaining of Ki67
antigen. Quantitative measurements indicated that TIP-1 did not change the proliferation
rate of glioblastoma cells in vivo (Figure 6d). These data suggested that the reduced tumor
cell dispersal was not resulted from the disadvantage in cell proliferation.
High levels of TIP-1 expression correlate with advanced stage and poor prognosis of
human malignant gliomas

Author Manuscript

To determine TIP-1 expression in human malignant gliomas, a TIP-1 specific antibody (28)
was used for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of human specimens. Within the 234
cases of pathologically verified clinical specimens (supplementary table s1), high TIP-1
protein levels were only detected in high grade gliomas whereas TIP-1 protein was barely
detectable in 15 cases of normal brain (Figure 7a and Supplementary table s1). IHC staining
indicated that TIP-1 is predominantly located in the cytosol with some plasma membrane
localization (Supplementary Figure s3). Semi-quantitative measurements revealed a
correlation between TIP-1 protein levels and the stage of malignant gliomas (Figure 7b).
However, TIP-1 levels were independent of patient's age or gender. A retrospective study of
gene expression profiles (29, 30) from 86 patients with grade III or grade IV glioblastomas
whose tumors had been surgically resected revealed that TIP-1 expression is a negative
prognostic indicator after the surgical removal of the tumor. For both of grade III and IV
glioma patients, those with tumors of high level of TIP-1 expression experienced a shorter
survival time after surgical removal of the primary tumors (Figure 7c). The correlation
between TIP-1 expression and patient survival time was further supported by analyzing a

large group of glioma patients in which overexpression of TIP-1 (more than 2-fold upregulation) was detected in over 50% of glioma patients (Supplementary Figure s4).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Several proteins have been identified as TIP-1 interacting partners in mammalian cells.
Through these protein interactions, TIP-1 demonstrates a variety of biological functions,
such as mediating the cellular response to serum starvation (10), inhibiting the beta-cateninregulated gene transcription and cell proliferation (9), establishing polarity of epithelial cell
(7), and protecting tumor cells from ionizing radiation-induced cell death (31). In this study,
we have identified ARHGEF7 as a novel TIP-1 interacting protein, and demonstrated that
this protein interaction is biologically relevant to the infiltrative growth of glioblastoma
cells. TIP-1 knockdown resulted in aberrant localization of ARHGEF7 and rhotekin, as well
as abnormal activation of Rho GTPases including Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, that was
accompanied with a reduced motility of glioblastoma cells in vitro and impaired infiltrative
tumor growth in vivo.

Author Manuscript

Roles of TIP-1 in the Rho GTPases activation and cell motility had been reported previously
in cervical cancer cells (8, 12, 32). In those reports, data indicated that TIP-1, probably
through cooperating with Arhgef16 or other mechanisms, facilitates the HPV-16 E6
oncoprotein-induced activation of RhoA, Cdc 42 and ROCK for cell migration. Knockdown
of TIP-1 or inhibition of Rho kinase resulted in a reduced cell motility in the HPV16 E6expresing cervical cancer cells (8). Since high levels of TIP-1 expression were also
documented in invasive human breast tumors, and TIP-1 knockdown reduced cell migration
in vitro and pulmonary metastasis in vivo (6). All these studies suggested that TIP-1 might
play a general role in the Rho GTPases activation and cell migration in a variety of tumor
cells.
Spatiotemporally regulated activation of Rho GTPases is finely orchestrated in cell
migration, which starts with protrusion at the leading edge and ends with rear retraction of
the distal cell body (27). In the past few years, accumulating evidences indicate that the
dynamic interactions with scaffold proteins are essential for Rho GEFs and effectors to
direct the Rho GTPase signaling outcomes in polarized migrating cells (13, 33). One
polarized scaffold protein, Scribble, was reported to interact with ARHGEF7 through its
PDZ domain and to translocate the activated Cdc42 and Rac1 to the migrating cell leading
edge (22, 23, 34). However, little is known about the roles of rhotekin in these processes and
how cells coordinately activate RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 during cell migration and invasion.

Author Manuscript

Previous reports (8, 12) suggested that TIP-1, probably through the PDZ domain-mediated
protein interactions, modulates a delicate balance of interactions between Scribble, HPV16
E6 oncoprotein, Arhgef16, Cdc42, or other proteins that are involved in the spatiotemporal
activation of Rho GTPases. Data from this study support that hypothesis. In this study, both
rhotekin and ARHGEF7 interact with Scribble through the PDZ domain, the interaction
dynamics and the intracellular distributions of those proteins are modulated by TIP-1 in
migrating glioblastoma cells. It was noted that TIP-1 knockdown enhanced the protein
interaction between ARHGEF7 and Scribble, but caused a loss of the dynamic regulation in

the protein interaction after scratch wounding. TIP-1 knockdown also remarkably changed
the cellular morphology and the distribution pattern of ARHGEF7 at the leading edge. On
the other hand, even the basal level of Scribble and rhotekin interaction was elevated with
the TIP-1 knockdown, the protein interaction was still dynamically regulated in the
migrating glioma cells. The data suggested that a competition might exist between Scribble
and TIP-1 in the selective binding to ARHGEF7 or rhotekin. This question was further
answered by experiments with the use of T98G cells with an ectopic expression of TIP-1.
The results indicated that an ectopic expression of functional TIP-1 reduced the overall
levels of these protein interactions but maintained the dynamic interactions of Scribble/
Arhgef7 and Scribble/Rhotekin in the migrating T98G cells, whereas ectopic expression of a
TIP-1 mutant containing a dysfunctional PDZ domain had a similar but less significant
effect on the protein interactions as the TIP-1 knockdown did (Supplementary Figure s5).
These data suggested the importance of PDZ domain in these competitive and dynamic
protein interactions. Therefore, we hypothesize that the high level expression of TIP-1
provides the flexibility of protein interactions that is required for the well-orchestrated
intracellular redistribution of ARHGEF7 and rhotekin in the migrating glioblastoma cells.
Since TIP-1 protein contains several hypothetical phosphorylation sites, it would be
interesting to further investigate whether protein modifications, such as phosphorylation or
dephosphorylation, are involved in the dynamic regulation of protein interactions between
Scribble, rhotekin, ARHGEF7 and TIP-1.

In migrating cells, Rac1 induces the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, Cdc42
induces the formation of filapodia, and RhoA triggers actin stress fiber formation and
retraction of the cell body (35, 36). We found that TIP-1 knockdown resulted in less
activated Rac1 and more activated RhoA in T98G cells after scratch wounding. The activity
reduction of Rac1 by TIP-1 knockdown is much greater than that of Cdc42. Consistent with
the abnormal activation of these Rho GTPases, glioblastoma cells with TIP-1 knockdown
adopted a highly branched morphology that might jointly reduce the motility of the TIP-1depleted glioblastoma cells. We also noted that other report showed that TIP-1, acting
together with ARHGEF16, activated Cdc42 and to a lesser extent, Rac1 in HPV16 E6
protein-expressing cervical cancer cells (12). These differences might be initiated through
independent pathways, caused by the counteraction between RhoA and Rac1 (24), or
resulted from the differential cellular context between cervical cancer cells and glioblastoma
cells. Identifying proteins involved in the complex formation of Scribble, Arhgef7, rhotekin
or TIP-1 would help to understand this mystery.

Author Manuscript

TIP-1 also binds to beta-catenin in the glioblastoma cells (Figure 1c). Beta-catenin
associates with actins through alpha-catenin and stabilizes the cytoskeleton (37).
Transactivation of nucleus-located beta-catenin also drives cell migration and invasion (38).
Although our study showed that TIP-1 expression within glioblastoma cells does not
significantly affect the beta-catenin-regulated gene expression and glioblastoma cell
proliferation in vitro and in vivo, we cannot rule out the possibility that TIP-1 regulates
glioma cell motility, cell morphology, or other cellular properties through interacting with
beta-catenin. The different impacts of TIP-1 on the cell proliferation between colon cancer

cells (9) and glioblastoma cells might suggest that some other cellular context would be
required for the TIP-1-regulated transcriptional activity of beta-catenin or cell proliferation.

Author Manuscript

Malignant gliomas are highly invasive. The infiltrative dispersal of malignant glioma cells
into normal brain impairs most of the currently available treatments. The vast majority
(80-90%) of tumor recurrences arise within 2-3 cm of the resection margin (39) but tumor
cells can also be found at far distant sites so that even hemispherectomies are not curative.
Therefore, identifying genes regulating glioma cell migration and invasion is crucial to
developing new therapeutic modalities for this fatal disease. This study demonstrated that
the elevated expression of TIP-1 correlates with invasive progression and poor prognosis of
human glioblastoma. Animal and cell-based studies indicated that TIP-1 expression is
required for the invasive growth of human glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In fact, we
found that TIP-1 knockdown in D54 glioblastoma cells greatly extended mice survival in
intracranial xenograft models (Supplementary Figure s6). Other than the reduced invasion,
TIP-1 knockdown also impaired the tumor-driven angiogenesis (40) and sensitized the
glioblastoma cells to cytotoxic agents (31). Taken together, we speculate that TIP-1 holds
potential as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target of malignant gliomas.

For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer without SDS (50 mM Tris HCl,
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). The cell
lysates were centrifuged at 16,000× g for 5 minutes and the supernatant, after addition of
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), was incubated for 2 hours at 4°C
with corresponding antibody and protein A-agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

lysis buffer and centrifuged at 13,000× g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was respectively
mixed with rhotekin RBD-agarose beads (for activated RhoA) or PAK1 PBD-agarose beads
(for activated Rac1/Cdc42) for 1 hour at 4°C. The activated Rho GTPases were analyzed by
western blot.
Cell staining and imaging
Cells were fixed and permeabilized in 4% formaldehyde solution before staining with
specific antibodies. The images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal
microscope. To quantify the percentage of individual proteins located at the cell leading
edge (those parts of cell membranes oriented toward the scratched wound), the fluorescence
intensity of each protein was measured using Image J software (National Institutes of
Health). The Pearson's correlation coefficients (25) were also produced with ImageJ to
measure the colocalization of two proteins.

Migration and invasion assays
Cell migration and invasion assays were performed using 8-μm porous Boyden chambers
(Corning Life Science, Lowell, MA) coated with or without Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Prior to the migration and invasion
assays, cells were maintained in serum free media overnight. The next day, 10,000 cells (for
migration) or 50,000 cells (for invasion) were seeded onto the upper chambers with serum
free media. Full media with 10% serum were added to the bottom chamber. Twelve hours
later, the cells that stayed on top of the membrane were removed with cotton swabs, and the

cells migrated to the bottom of the membrane were stained with DAPI and counted under a
fluorescent microscope. Cell migration was also measured using the scratch wound healing
assay (43). Briefly, cells were allowed to grow to confluence on glass cover slips. After
starving the cells overnight with serum free media, cells were scratched with a 200 μL
pipette tip, and allowed to grow in fresh media for the indicated time before fixation and
staining.
In vivo xenograft tumor model of glioblastoma

Author Manuscript

The intracranial tumor model was described previously (44). Briefly, 1×104 D54 or T4302
cells with or without TIP-1 knockdown in 10 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were
injected 3 mm deep (from the skull surface) into the right burr hole (2mm posterior to the
bregma and 3mm to the right of the midline) of the brains of FoxN1-null nude mice (Harlan
Laboratories, Prattville, AL). The mice were monitored daily for hypomotility, absence of
grooming behavior, and weight loss. Tumor progression was verified by histological
assessment. All the animal studies were conducted as approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Vanderbilt University.
Immunohistochemistry of tumor tissues

Author Manuscript

To study histological changes in the intracranial tumor model, tumors were retrieved 3
weeks after tumor cell implantation, fixed in formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Ten
μm thick tumor sections were de-paraffinized in graded alcohols, rehydrated and heated in
10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval using a pressure cooker. The tissue slides
were subsequently stained with Ki67 antibody or TIP-1 antibody and counterstained with
hematoxylin. Tumor invasion was quantified upon 200x microscopic images of tumor
sections across main tumor mass as described (45). For the study of TIP-1 expression within
human specimens, tissue microarrays containing pathologically verified astrocytoma,
anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiform (GBM) of WHO grade I to IV (46) and
normal tissue were purchased from US Biomax (Rockville, MD). The tissue slides were
stained with TIP-1 antibody and counterstained with hematoxylin as described above. TIP-1
expression intensity was scored using a semi-quantitative four-point scale based on lightmicroscopic observations as follows: 1 = background; 2 = scattered weak staining; 3 =
moderately intense and more widespread staining; 4 = heavy staining.
Statistics

Author Manuscript

All numerical data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical comparisons
between groups were performed by ANOVA. For correlation studies of TIP-1 expression
and patient survival probability, datasets from Freije et. al. (29) and Phillips et. al. (30) that
contain 86 clinically annotated brain tumor specimens were reanalyzed. All these brain
tumors are WHO grade III or grade IV glioblastomas. The data from grade III or grade IV
gliomas patients were analyzed separately. Patients within the top 40% of TIP-1 expression
were defined as the high expression group, and those in the bottom 40% were defined as the
low expression group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used, and the log rank test was
performed using MedCalc to determine differences between the two groups of patients. For
all analyses, a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

High levels of TIP-1 expression correlate with advanced staging and poor prognosis of
human malignant gliomas. (a) TIP-1 expression in human gliomas. Representative tissue
core images from a tissue microarray stained with a TIP-1 antibody (brown) demonstrate
differential TIP-1 protein levels in normal brain and gliomas. Scale bar: 200 μm. (b) Semiquantitative histological evaluation of TIP-1 expression within human glioma tissues. TIP-1
level was scored from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest), mean expression scores multiplied by the
percentage of positive cells in the field (Quick's combined score system) are presented for
normal brain, grade I, grade II, grade III and grade IV gliomas, respectively, in a graphical
format using error bars with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistically significant
differences of TIP-1 expression (ANOVA) were noted between normal brain tissue and
gliomas of varying stages of malignancy (*, p<0.001) and between the advanced (III or IV)
and low grade tumors (Student T-test, #, p<0.005). Number of samples in each group was
shown under the bar graph. Box plots show no correlation of TIP-1 expression levels with
patient's age or gender (F, female; M, male). (c) Kaplan-Meier plot of patient survival time
upon relative TIP-1 expression levels. Patients within the top 40% of TIP-1 expression were
defined as the high expression group, and those in the bottom 40% were defined as the low
expression group. A log rank test was used to evaluate differences between groups.
