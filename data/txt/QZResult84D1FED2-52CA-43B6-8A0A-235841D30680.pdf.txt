BACKGROUND: Metastatic dissemination is the most frequent cause of death in patients with sporadic colorectal cancer (sCRC). It is
believed that the metastatic process is related at least in part to a specific background of genetic alterations accumulated in cells
from primary tumors, and the ability to detect such alterations is critical for the identification of patients with sCRC who are at risk of
developing metastases. METHODS: The authors used high-resolution, 500-K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to identify copy
number alteration profiles present at diagnosis in primary tumors from patients with metastatic (n 5 23) versus nonmetastatic
(n 5 26) sCRC. RESULTS: The results revealed a characteristic pattern of copy number alterations in metastatic sCRC tumors that
involved losses of 23 regions at chromosomes 1p, 17p, and 18q, together with gains of 35 regions at chromosomes 7 and 13q.
CONCLUSIONS: In line with expectations, the copy number profile investigated involved multiple genes that were associated previously with sCRC (ie, SMAD2) and=or the metastatic process (ie, podocalyxin-like [PODXL]), and it also was associated with a poorer

INTRODUCTION
Sporadic colorectal cancer (sCRC) is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the Western world.1 Up to 50% of
all patients with sCRC eventually will develop metastases, and their 5-year overall survival rate is approximately 50% to
60%.2 Once metastases (ie, mostly liver metastasis) have occurred, a complete cure is unlikely,2 and up to two-thirds of
patients with sCRC who die have evidence of liver metastasis.3 Accumulating evidence indicates that sCRC metastasis
may emerge in the context of a specific genetic tumor background associated or not with other genetic alterations, further
affecting cellular control of growth and proliferation.4 The discovery of those specific genetic alterations that would contribute toward identifying patients who are at risk of harboring or developing metastases could contribute significantly to
the development of new strategies for the diagnosis and management of the diseases.
In recent years, multiple recurrent chromosomal abnormalities identified in primary tumors have been associated
with metastatic CRC.4,5 Among others, these include numerical gains of the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q), 13q, and
20q and losses of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p), 8p, 17p, 18q, and 22q. In a recent study, we used interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) to further establish that 17p deletion (del[17p]) involving the 17p11.2 breakpoint
region and del(22q) were highly prevalent cytogenetic alterations among patients with primary sCRC who had synchronous liver metastasis.6 However, the identification of specific genes targeted by such chromosomal alterations has proven
difficult, partially because of technical issues. In recent years, the development of genome-wide approaches like high-

density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays has
made it possible to identify small regions of chromosomal
gains and losses with much greater resolution, down to
2.5 kb.5
In the current study, we used 500-K SNP arrays
(mean distance between interrogated SNPs 5 5.8 kb) to
map genetic alterations that were present already at diagnosis in primary tumors from 49patients with sCRC (23
metastatic tumors vs 26 nonmetastatic tumors). Our
main objective was to define differential copy number
alteration (CNA) profiles between metastatic and nonmetastatic tumors for a better understanding of the genetics
of the metastatic process in sCRC. To evaluate the reproducibility of the SNP-array results, we performed parallel
iFISH analyses of the same tumor samples using 8 probes
directed against the chromosomes that are most frequently altered in sCRC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Samples

Surgical specimens from 49 patients who were diagnosed
with sCRC between June 2000 and September 2007 were
collected prospectively and included in this study after
informed consent was obtained from each patient. All
patients underwent surgical resection of tumor tissues at
the Department of Surgery of the University Hospital of
Salamanca (Salamanca, Spain) and were diagnosed and
classified according to World Health Organization criteria7 before they received any treatment. The study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Salamanca. The median follow-up at the time the
study was closed was 97 months (range, 24-124 months).
Of 49 patients, 23 (47%) had liver metastases (group 1)
identified either at the time of colorectal surgery (n 5 14)
or during the first year after diagnosis (n 5 9). The other
26 patients (53%) had tumors without metastatic dissemination during long a follow-up (group 2). The clinical
and laboratory data from these patients are summarized in
Table 1.
After the histopathologic diagnosis was established,
samples from representative areas of the primary tumors
that exhibited macroscopic infiltration were either fixed
in formalin and embedded in paraffin or frozen in liquid
nitrogen and then stored either at room temperature or at
280 C, respectively. From these tissue samples, sections
were cut from 3 different areas representative of the tumor
tissue used for the SNP-array studies, and they were
placed over poly L-lysine–coated slides. For SNP-array
studies, tumor DNA was extracted from freshly frozen tuCancer

mor samples that contained 65% epithelial tumor cells.
In turn, normal DNA was extracted from matched peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes from the same patient. For
both types of samples, DNA was extracted using the
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
SNP-Array Studies

Each DNA sample derived from primary tumors and normal PB leukocytes was hybridized to 2 different 250-K
Affymetrix SNP mapping arrays (NspI and StyI SNP
arrays; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif). For this purpose,
250 ng of DNA per array were used according to the
instructions of the manufacturer. Fluorescence signals
were detected using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner
3000. Average genotyping call rates of 94.4%, 95.6%,
and 97.6% were obtained from primary tumors corresponding to the metastatic tumors (group 1), the nonmetastatic tumors (group 2), and normal PB DNA samples,
respectively.
To identify copy number changes throughout the
whole tumor genome, the aroma.affymetrix algorithm
was used, following the CRMA version 2 method in the R
software package, as described elsewhere8 (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; available at:
http:==www.aroma-project.org, accessed March 18,
2014). The array normalization steps we used have been
described previously by Munoz-Bellvis et al.5 Next, data
from the 250-K StyI and 250-K NspI arrays were integrated into a single database, and raw copy number values
were calculated as transformed log2 values of the following ratios calculated for each patient: group 1 primary
tumor=normal PB, group 2 primary tumor=normal PB,
and group 1 primary tumor=group 2 primary tumor.
To identify DNA regions with similar copy number
values, the circular binary segmentation method with
default parameters was used exactly as implemented in the
open-source DNAcopy Bioconductor software package
(Bioconductor Project Core Team, Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Wash)9; the criteria used to
define single-point copy number changes were based on P
values  .01 for 7 markers per DNA segment, and median segment values were assigned to each probe using
smoothed values. For the identification of CNAs (gains or
losses), a threshold was established based on the changes
observed in the fluorescence intensity of sequential DNA
segments for group 1 primary tumor versus PB, for group
2 primary tumor versus PB, and for group 1 versus group
2 primary tumor samples (log2 ratio cutoff values of
>0.09 and <20.09 for copy number gains and losses,

respectively). For each tumor sample analyzed, the specific
frequencies of both copy number gains and losses per
SNP were established and plotted along individual chromosomes. Common altered regions were identified based
on the empirical frequency distribution of gains and losses
among group 1 and group 2 primary tumor samples,
respectively, by grouping contiguous SNPs that had
adjusted P values < .01 (false discovery rate [FDR] correction was based on the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure).10 Moderated t test analyses were used to identify
significant differences in copy numbers between metastatic and nonmetastatic samples (FDR-corrected P values
< .05). Significant regions were defined as contiguous sets
of at least 7 SNPs that differed significantly. A P value was
assigned to the region by using the worst FDR-corrected
P value among the SNPs included in that region. Genes

coded in these regions were identified using the Ensembl
release 53 tool (available at: http:==www.ensembl.org,

iFISH Studies

To evaluate the reproducibility of the SNP-array results
and to assess the impact of background noise using this
technique, iFISH analyses of the same tumor samples
were performed in parallel, using 8 probes directed against
an identical number of regions from 8 different human
chromosomes (Table 2).
Additional Statistical Methods

For all continuous variables, mean values with standard
deviations and ranges were calculated using the SPSS software package (SPSS version 15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill;

for dichotomic variables, frequencies were reported. To
evaluate the statistical significance of differences observed
between groups, the Student t test and the Mann-Whitney
U test were used for continuous variables, depending on
whether they did or did not display a normal distribution;
for qualitative variables, the chi-square test was applied
(Cross-Tab; SPSS Inc.). Survival analyses were performed
using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the significance of
differences in survival between different groups was
assessed using a 1-sided log-rank test. Hazard ratios were
calculated for each particular chromosomal region using a
Cox proportional hazards model as implemented in the
“survival” R package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) using the Efrom approximation to control for ties
in survival times. The assumption for proportional odds
was tested using the partial likelihood-ratio test. Rightcensored observations were considered those observations
in which the event of death had not occurred at the date of
last contact, ie, the date of the censored observation. These
right-censored observations were taken into account in the
estimation of the partial likelihood as follows:

where di 5 1 if t(i) is a time-of-death event, and di 5 0 if
t(i) is the time of censoring. Statistical significance was
considered present if the P value (or the Pearson-corrected
P value) was < .05. Only those iFISH probes with >12
SNPs localized in the iFISH mapped region (Table 2)
were used for correlation studies, and the copy number
status was identified by the SNP array (gain vs loss vs no
change) for those SNPs localized at each iFISH region.
P values < .01 were associated with statistical significance.

RESULTS
Clinical and Biologic Characteristics of Liver
Metastatic Versus Nonmetastatic sCRC

Overall, patients who had sCRC with liver metastases had
a greater frequency of lymph node metastases (P < .001)
and abnormally increased serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels (P < .001) than patients who had sCRC without metastases (Table 1). From the prognostic point of
view, those who had sCRC with liver metastases also had
more deaths associated with significantly shortened overall survival (median, 26 months vs not reached, respectively; P < .001). By contrast, no significant differences
were observed between patients with versus without liverCancer

Differences in Copy Number Alterations of
Primary Tumors Between Metastatic and
Nonmetastatic sCRC

Overall, many different CNAs were common in both
metastatic and nonmetastatic primary sCRCs. These
included deletions involving chromosomes 3p, 4, 5q, 8p,
10q, 15p, and 22q; whole chromosome 14 losses; and
gains of chromosomes 1q, 2p, 3q, 5p, 6p, 8q, 11p, and
20q (Fig. 1). However, differences in the relative percentage of tumors that had some of these specific copy number
changes also were observed between the 2 tumor groups
(Tables 3 and 4). These mostly included differences in the
frequency of deleted regions in chromosomes 1p, 17p,
and 18q together with gains of chromosomes 7 and 13q,
all of which had a greater incidence (P < .05) among primary tumors from patients who presented with metastatic
versus nonmetastatic disease. A comparison between the
specific copy number changes that were present differentially in both groups of tumors revealed a total of 58
altered chromosomal regions, all of which were identified
more frequently (P < .05) in metastatic tumors versus
nonmetastatic tumors. From these, 23 copy number
changes corresponded to interstitial deletions at 1p36
(n 5 1), 1p33 (n 5 1), 17p12 (n 5 1), 18q11 (n 5 1),
18q11 (n 5 3), 18q21(n 5 7), 18q12 (n 5 3), 18q21
(n 5 9), 18q22 (n 5 4), and 18q23 (n 5 1); and 35 corresponded to regions of gain at 7p22 (n 5 6), 7p15 (n 5 1),

Impact of CNAs on Overall Survival in Patients
With sCRC

Genes With an Adverse Impact on Patient
Outcome

From the 23 interstitial deletions described above that were
observed more frequently in metastatic versus nonmetastatic
primary sCRC tumors, 19 deletions (83%) were associated
with a poorer outcome (P < .05) (Table 3); furthermore, 3
of these 19 interstitial deletions, all of which were localized
to chromosome 18 (base pairs [bp], from start to end)—
18q21 (bp 44,879,066-45,497,910), 18q22 (bp
71,062,175-71,979,380 and bp 71,991,789-72,194,339),
were strongly associated with poorer overall survival
(P 5 .01; hazard ratio, >6) (Table 3). Regarding chromosomal gains, 23 of 35 gains (66%) also had an impact on the
overall survival of patients with sCRC (Table 4); of these,
gains of chromosome 7p11 (bp 54,502,479-57,882,571)
and chromosome 13q31 (bp 90,792,026-90,867,535 and
bp 92,522,499-92,673,304) had a stronger association with
overall survival (P 5 .01; hazard ratio, >3) (Table 4).

Genes coded within the chromosomal regions that exhibited a greater frequency of alteration in primary metastatic
tumors versus primary nonmetastatic tumors, in association with an adverse impact on overall survival, included a
total of 52 and 26 genes mapped in the deleted and gained
chromosomal regions, respectively (Table 5). It is noteworthy that, almost 50% of the 52 deleted genes were previously associated with colorectal cancer (n 5 24), and
another 50% (n 5 24) have been related to the metastatic
process. Concerning genes involved in the gained chromosomal regions, it was reported previously that 15 of 26
genes were involved in colorectal cancer (eg glioblastoma
amplified sequence [GBAS]) and=or the metastatic process (eg, podocalyxin-like [PODXL]). Figure 2 indicates
that such deleted (eg genes coded at chromosome 18q21)
or gained (eg genes coded at chromosomes 7p11 and
7q22) cancer-associated genes are directly related to well
established genetic markers of sCRC, such as epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), the SMAD family of
genes, and the deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC)
gene.35,45,46 In addition, in the literature, it was reported

previously that several of these genes exhibited deletion
and loss of expression or gain and overexpression in metastatic sCRC (Fig. 2).
DISCUSSION
Most sCRC deaths are associated with metastatic dissemination of the primary tumor. New advances in genetic
profiling of sCRCs suggest that primary tumors may already contain tumor cells with metastatic potential.4
Herein, we describe a comprehensive, detailed map of
CNAs present in primary tumors from patients with metastatic versus nonmetastatic sCRC who were followed for
a relatively long time, as assessed by high-resolution, 500K SNP arrays and confirmed by iFISH studies. A high
correlation also was observed between the SNP-array
results and iFISH analyses performed on the same series
of primary tumor samples with regard to the most commonly deleted (eg 17p and 18q) and gained (eg 7 and
13q) chromosomal regions, in line with in our previous

findings.5,47 To our knowledge, this is the most extensive
study in which high-resolution SNP arrays have been used
to define and compare the CNA profiles of both groups of
sCRC tumors. Overall, we observed that there were many
CNAs in common between the 2 groups of tumors,
including losses of 3p, 4, 5q, 8p, 10q, 14q, 15q, and 22q
and gains of 1q, 2p, 3q, 5p, 6q, 8q, 11p, and 20q. However, in addition to the CNAs that were common to both
metastatic and nonmetastatic tumors, multiple CNAs
occurred with greater frequency in primary tumors from
patients with metastatic disease. These latter CNAs
mainly involved regions lost at chromosomes 1p, 17p,
and 18q together with regions of gain at chromosomes 7
and 13q.
Previous studies based on lower resolution cytogenetic analyses of primary tumors from patients with metastatic sCRC48,49 demonstrated frequent alterations of
different regions at chromosomes 1p, 7, 13q, 17p, and
18q.48,50-53 Herein, we identified 58 different regions in

these same chromosomes that were altered preferentially
in primary metastatic tumors versus primary nonmetastatic tumors. Furthermore, approximately 75% of these
regions also were associated with poorer overall survival.
Altogether, these observations point out the potential relevance of genes coded in these chromosomal regions in the
development of sCRC metastasis.
Loss of chromosome 1p is well documented in
sCRC.52 Allelic losses of chromosome 1p have been associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and reduced
patient survival.50,54 In line with our findings, Ghadimi
1954

et al observed a greater frequency of chromosome 1p32ter loss in metastatic versus nonmetastatic cancer (61% vs
11% of patients) using comparative genomic hybridization.53 Our results indicate a particularly high frequency
of losses involving the 1p33 chromosomal locus, which
may harbor relevant tumor suppressor genes like the embryonic lethal, abnormal vision (ELAV)-like neuron specific RNA binding protein 4 (ELAVL4) gene. Of note,
Stawski et al recently reported significantly decreased
expression of ELAVL4 among male patients with meningiomas who carried deletions at D1S162, supporting the

Figure 2. Copy number changes detected in primary tumors from patients with metastatic (n 5 23) versus nonmetastatic (n 5 26)
sporadic colorectal cancer (sCRC) were genotyped on the Affymetrix 500-K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array platform corresponding to (A) gains of the 7p11 and 7q22 chromosome (Chr.) 7 regions and (B) chromosome 18q21 losses. In both A

hypothesis that ELAVL4 may act as a tumor suppressor
gene in meningiomas.55
In line with our previous findings using iFISH,6
del(17p) also was observed with significantly greater frequency among patients with metastatic tumors versus
patients with nonmetastatic tumors and was associated
with a poorer prognosis. These results are also in line with
the observations of other groups that evaluated the association between del(17p) and outcome in patients with
stage II and stage III sCRC56; however, apart from tumor
protein 53 (TP53), the specific relevant genes involved
remain to be identified.
Del(18q) has long been observed in sCRC using a
broad panel of techniques that vary from conventional cytogenetics57 and iFISH4 to comparative genomic hybridization, comparative genomic hybridization arrays, and
SNP arrays.47 Within the long arm of chromosome 18,
the 18q21 cytoband was the most frequently altered
(range, 50%-70% of CRCs) in those studies.4,47,57 This
region contains both the DCC and SMAD genes, which
are well established genetic biomarkers of sCRC and typically are associated with advanced disease. Currently, it is
well establish that DCC plays a role in inducing apoptosis,
whereas SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4 [DPC4]) encodes intracellular transducers of the transforming growth
factor-b apoptosis pathway.35,58,59 It is worth noting that
deletions at other specific subregions of chromosome 18q
also have been associated with a poor prognosis in
advanced sCRC.60 Thus, Liu et al observed that loss of
18q12-qter is an independent prognostic marker that is
detected more frequently in stage III=IV (vs stage I)
tumors.61 Similarly, Poulogiannis et al used DNA microarrays to identify DNA copy number losses at 18q12.2
involving a single gene—ie, the BRUNOL4 (Bruno-like 4
splicing factor) gene—as an independent, adverse prognostic factor.62 In addition to the BRUNOL4 gene, we
also observed 5 other recurrently altered genes in this
same chromosomal region: 2 of those genes were associated previously with sCRC (eg microtubule-associated
protein RP=EB family member 2 [MAPRE2] and zinc finger protein 24 [ZNF24]), another gene was associated
recurrently with the metastatic process (eg phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic subunit type 3 [PIK3C3]), and
the remaining 2 genes were related previously to other
malignancies like ovarian cancer (UDP-N-acetyl-a-D-galactosamine, polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 [GALNT1])63 and esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (solute carrier 14-urea transporter, member 2
[SLC14A2]).64 It is noteworthy that the greater number
of 18q22 genes identified in our series versus that reported
Cancer

by Poulogiannis et al potentially may have a technical
explanation because of the use of a higher resolution
array (down to 2.5 kb vs 1 Mb) in the 2 series. In addition, the greater number of genes identified also may be
related to the loss of other genes that are codeleted in
chromosome 18q12. In line with this hypothesis, Knosel et al reported an association between del(18q23)
observed with comparative genomic hybridization and
both lymphatic and liver metastasis.65 Storojeva et al
used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
analysis to establish that del(18q22) involving DNAX
accessory molecule 1 (DNAM-1), suppressor of cytokine
signaling 6 (SOCS6), and a-7 nictonic receptor
(ACHR-7) also was associated with a worse prognosis
among patients with sCRC,66 and we also identified
other deleted regions at chromosome 18q (ie, 18q11,
18q12, 18q21, 18q22, and 18q23) that were associated
with shorter overall survival.
It is noteworthy that we identified 3 regions of gain
in chromosome 7 associated with poor outcome and metastasis: the 7p11, 7q22 and 7q23 chromosomal regions.
The former encodes a well establish oncogene, ie, the
EGFR gene, which is involved in cell proliferation with
antiapoptotic properties.46,67 It is noteworthy that different studies have reported coamplification with EGFR of
several other adjacent genes, such as the SEC g subunit
(SEC61G) and LanC lantibiotic synthase component Clike 2 (LANCL2) genes in breast cancer68 and the
LANCL2, vesicular-overexpressed in cancer prosurvival
protein 1(VOPP1), phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH),
and glioblastoma amplified sequence (GBAS) genes in
glioblastoma.69 In turn, the 7q22 chromosomal region
contains the cytochrome p450 family 3, subfamily A,
polypeptide 5 (CYP3A5) and CYP3A7 genes, which
encode for the P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism. In line with our findings, overexpression of the
CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 genes has been detected recurrently
in primary sCRC tumors17 and metastatic prostate cancer.70 Finally, special attention should be paid to the
PODXL gene coded at chromosome 7q32, because
PODXL is involved in cell adhesion, which has been associated with the metastatic process71 and also with a poor
prognosis among patients with sCRC.21
With regard to chromosome 13q, in the current
study, we identified 9 regions in which 13q gains were
associated with metastatic tumors and poorer overall survival. However, we did not identify any coded genes in
these regions that were related previously with the oncogenic process; for instance, a clear association between
gains of these chromosomal regions and both tumor

metastasis and a poor prognosis have been reported previously by our group and others.5,47,62
In summary, in this study, we used high-resolution
SNP-array techniques to describe in detail the genetic
alterations most frequently associated with metastatic
sCRC and the potential genes involved. Further gene
expression profiling and functional studies focused on
such genes encoded at chromosomes 1p, 7, 13q, 17p, and
18q and their potential interactions are needed to establish their precise pathogenic role in the metastatic process
in patients with sCRC.
