Abstract
Enzymatic depletion of the nonessential amino acid L-Arginine
(L-Arg) in patients with cancer by the administration of a pegylated form of the catabolic enzyme arginase I (peg-Arg I) has
shown some promise as a therapeutic approach. However, L-Arg
deprivation also suppresses T-cell responses in tumors. In this
study, we sought to reconcile these observations by conducting a
detailed analysis of the effects of peg-Arg I on normal T cells.
Strikingly, we found that peg-Arg I blocked proliferation and cellcycle progression in normal activated T cells without triggering
apoptosis or blunting T-cell activation. These effects were associated with an inhibition of aerobic glycolysis in activated T cells,
but not with signiﬁcant alterations in mitochondrial oxidative
respiration, which thereby regulated survival of T cells exposed to
peg-Arg I. Further mechanistic investigations showed that the

addition of citrulline, a metabolic precursor for L-Arg, rescued
the antiproliferative effects of peg-Arg I on T cells in vitro.
Moreover, serum levels of citrulline increased after in vivo
administration of peg-Arg I. In support of the hypothesis that
peg-Arg I acted indirectly to block T-cell responses in vivo, pegArg I inhibited T-cell proliferation in mice by inducing accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). MDSC
induction by peg-Arg I occurred through the general control
nonrepressed-2 eIF2a kinase. Moreover, we found that peg-Arg
I enhanced the growth of tumors in mice in a manner that
correlated with higher MDSC numbers. Taken together, our
results highlight the risks of the L-Arg–depleting therapy for
cancer treatment and suggest a need for cotargeting MDSC in
such therapeutic settings. Cancer Res; 75(2); 275–83. 2014 AACR.

Introduction

malignant cells that depended upon exogenous L-Arg for growth
(auxotrophic) and did not induce signiﬁcant toxic side effects (3).
The antitumor effect induced by peg-Arg I was mediated by the
induction of malignant cell apoptosis (6) and controlled through
the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2
alpha (eIF2a) and the expression of general control nonrepressed
2 eIF2a kinase (GCN2; ref. 11). Although peg-Arg I was highly
effective in controlling the growth of leukemic T cells (6, 11), its
effect on normal T cells remains unclear. Initial in vitro studies
showed that L-Arg starvation blocked proliferation of activated
normal T cells (12–14). In addition, we found that peg-Arg I
delayed development of GVHD and increased burden of Listeria
monocytogenes (15, 16), both conditions linked to impaired T-cell
function. However, the mechanisms by which peg-Arg I could
impair T-cell responses in vivo and how normal activated T cells
maintain survival under L-Arg starvation remain unknown.
Speciﬁc energy metabolic pathways regulate the activation
and proliferation of normal T cells. Production of ATP and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the mitochondria control the
initial T-cell–activation phase, whereas aerobic glycolysis modulates proliferation and effector T-cell functions (17–21).
Although speciﬁc energy metabolic programming regulates global
function of T cells, it remains unknown the effect of L-Arg in the
modulation of energy metabolism.
Accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), a
heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells expressing
CD11bþ Gr1þ, is a hallmark of chronic inﬂammation and a major
mediator for the induction of T-cell suppression in various tumors
(22, 23). MDSCs block T-cell responses through the metabolism

Therapeutic modulation of speciﬁc cellular metabolic pathways in solid and hematologic malignancies represents a major
strategy for the development of new treatments (1–4). Metabolism of the nonessential amino acid L-Arginine (L-Arg) plays a
central role in several biologic systems including the modulation
of immune responses and tumor growth (5). We and others
described the therapeutic beneﬁt of depleting L-Arg in hematologic and solid tumors through a pegylated form of the human LArg–metabolizing enzyme arginase I (peg-Arg I; refs. 6–10).
Pegylation of arginase I increased its stability in vivo, without
altering its activity (7). Moreover, peg-Arg I was effective against

of L-Arg by the enzymes arginase I and inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS), which promote L-Arg depletion and production
of peroxynitrite, respectively (24, 25). Although the role of L-Arg
metabolism on the T-cell suppression induced by MDSC is well
understood, the effect of the deprivation of L-Arg in the accumulation and function of MDSC remains unknown.
Because the potential contradictory effect of L-Arg depletion as
an antitumor therapy and as a mechanism for inhibition of
immune responses, we aimed to understand the effects of pegArg I on normal T cells. Our results show the regulatory effect of
peg-Arg I on T-cell proliferation and the ability of T cells to resist
peg-Arg I through de novo L-Arg synthesis. Moreover, L-Arg deprivation induced the accumulation of MDSC, which inhibited T-cell
proliferation in mice. These results support the novel role of
MDSC in the regulation of T-cell responses by L-Arg starvation
and suggest the need to therapeutically target MDSC in peg-Arg
I–based therapies.

Materials and Methods
Mice and cells
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories.
CD45.1þ, GCN2/, and anti-OVA257-264 (siinfekl) OT-1 mice
were from The Jackson Laboratories. Lewis lung carcinoma cells
(3LL) were obtained in 2012 from the ATCC and injected s.c. into
the mice (26). 3LL cells were periodically tested (last-test May
2014) and validated to be mycoplasma-free, using an ATCC kit.
All mice studies were achieved using an approved Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee protocol from Louisiana State
University-Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA. T cells were
isolated from spleens and lymph nodes of mice using T-cellnegative isolation kits (Dynal, Life Technologies). Then, T cells
were activated using 0.5 mg/mL plate bound anti-CD3 plus antiCD28 (26). MDSCs were isolated from spleens of mice using Gr-1
selection kits (Stem Cell Technologies). Purity for cell isolations
ranged from 90% to 99%.
Antibodies and reagents
Detailed description of antibodies, methodologies for ﬂow
cytometry and ﬂuorescence, and statistical analysis are in the
Supplementary Methods. O'-methylpolyethylene-glycol (PEG)
5,000 mw (Sigma-Aldrich) was covalently attached to humanrecombinant arginase I (AbboMax) or bovine serum albumin
(BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) in a 50:1 molar ratio (7). Pegylated-BSA
(peg-BSA) was used as control for peg-Arg I.
Adoptive T-cell transfer
Mice were treated with peg-Arg I or peg-BSA every 2 days
starting the day before the T-cell transfer. CD45.2þ mice were
adoptively transferred with 5  106 CD45.1þ/OT-1 T cells, followed by immunization s.c. with 0.5 mg siinfekl peptide in
incomplete Freud's Adjuvant. Four days later, mice were injected
i.p with 200 mg 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; BD Biosciences), and BrdUrd incorporation measured 24 hours later
using the APC-BrdU Kit (BD Biosciences). For studies using
depletion of MDSC, mice were treated with 200 mg anti–Gr-1
antibody (RB6-8C5) or IgG control twice a week, starting the day
before the adoptive transfer. For MDSC proliferation, mice were
treated with peg-Arg I every other day for 7 days, after which
BrdUrd uptake into CD11bþ Gr-1þ cells was tested. Analysis of
nuclear DNA content was achieved using the CycleTEST-DNA Kit

(BD Biosciences). T-cell apoptosis was tested using Annexin V–
FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences). Staurosporine (1
mmol/L) was added 24 hours prior the apoptosis analysis as
positive control.
[3-3H]-glucose uptake
Glucose uptake was tested after pulsing activated T cells cultured with peg-BSA or peg-Arg I (48 hours) with 1 mCi/mL
Glucose-[3-3H] (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Eight hours later,
T cells were washed in PBS, collected, and tested for radioactivity
(counts per minute).
Extracellular ﬂux analysis
Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidiﬁcation rates (ECAR) were measured using the XF-24-extracellular ﬂux
analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). In brief, 5  105 activated T cells
treated for 24 to 72 hours with peg-Arg I or peg-BSA were plated in
XF-24 cell culture plates coated with 15 mg CellTak (BD Biosciences) in XF media (DMEM containing 11 mmol/L glucose and
100 mmol/L sodium pyruvate). For OCR, T cells were analyzed
under basal conditions and in response to 10 mmol/L oligomycin, 1
mmol/L ﬂuorocarbonyl-cyanide-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and 1
mmol/L rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich). For ECAR, T cells were plated in
XF media lacking glucose and monitored under basal conditions
and in response to 10 mmol/L glucose, 10 mmol/L oligomycin, and
100 mmol/L 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG; Sigma-Aldrich).
siRNA transfection of primary T cells
Argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS-1) siRNA, nontargeting
control siRNA, and FAM-labeled nontargeting control siRNA were
obtained from Thermo Scientiﬁc (Accell-SMARTpool). Activated
T cells (2  105) were transfected (2 mmol/L siRNA) using Accell
siRNA delivery media plus 2% FBS, following the vendor's protocol. Transfection efﬁciency ranged from 90% to 95% and
viability from 95% to 99%. Peg-Arg I (1 mg/mL) or peg-BSA (1
mg/mL) were added 12 hours after transfection.

Results
Effects of peg-Arg I on T-cell proliferation and activation
Our previous results showed that peg-Arg I blocked malignant
T-cell proliferation through the induction of cellular apoptosis;
however, the effect of peg-Arg I on normal T cells remains unclear
(6, 11). To test this, we ﬁrst investigated the effect of peg-Arg I
on the proliferation of CFSE-labeled activated T cells. A dosedependent inhibition of T-cell proliferation was found after
the addition of peg-Arg I, but not with control peg-BSA (Fig.
1A). The antiproliferative effect triggered by peg-Arg I was similarly noted in both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells and was associated
with a lower IFNg production (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
To validate our results in vivo, we tested the effect of peg-Arg I in the
proliferation of anti-OVA257-264 (siinfekl) transgenic CD8þ OT-1
cells. Thus, CD45.2þ mice were adoptively transferred with
CD45.1þ CD8þ OT-1 cells, followed by immunization with
siinfekl peptide. Mice were injected i.p. with peg-Arg I or pegBSA the day before T-cell transfer and then every two days. A
signiﬁcant decrease in CD45.1þ OT-1 cell proliferation, as tested
by BrdUrd uptake, was found in immunized mice treated with
peg-Arg I, compared with those injected with peg-BSA (Fig. 1B).
To evaluate a potential T-cell toxicity side effect, we measured Tcell subsets in spleens of na€ve mice treated for a week with

increasing concentrations of peg-Arg I or peg-BSA. Peg-Arg I
treatment was well tolerated and did not signiﬁcantly alter the
percentages of CD3þ, CD4þ, and CD8þ T cells in spleen (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C). Therefore, peg-Arg I blocked proliferation of activated T cells, but did not affect homeostatic na€ve Tcell numbers.
To better understand the mechanisms by which peg-Arg I
blocked T-cell proliferation, we tested the effect of peg-Arg I in the
induction of T-cell apoptosis and cell-cycle progression. A similar
low expression of the apoptosis marker Annexin V was found in
activated T cells treated with peg-Arg I or peg-BSA (Fig. 1C).
Conversely, upregulation of Annexin V was noted in T cells treated

with the apoptosis-inducer staurosporine. Furthermore, an arrest in
the G0–G1 phase of the cell cycle, which correlated with a decreased
expression of cyclin D3 and cdk4, was found in activated T cells
cultured with peg-Arg I, compared with peg-BSA–treated T cells
(Fig. 1D and E). We next evaluated the effect of peg-Arg I on T-cell
activation by testing the expression of the early activation T-cell
markers CD25 and CD69 and the production of IL2. Similar
upregulation of CD25 and CD69 and comparable percentages of
IL2þ cells were found in activated T cells treated with increasing
doses of peg-Arg I or peg-BSA (Fig. 1F and G). Also, in agreement
with the results showing the activation-independent antiproliferative effect induced by peg-Arg I, we found that addition of peg-Arg I

after 24 hours of activation still inhibited T-cell proliferation (Fig.
1H). Therefore, peg-Arg I blocks proliferation and cell-cycle progression of T cells without leading to apoptosis or impairing the
expression of early activation mediators.
Effects of peg-Arg I on T-cell energy metabolic pathways
Speciﬁc energy metabolic pathways control the proliferation
and activation of normal T cells. Proliferating T cells are highly
dependent on the production of energy through aerobic glycolysis, whereas mitochondrial oxidative respiration fuels T-cell
activation (20). Thus, we tested the effect of peg-Arg I on T-cell
energy metabolism using extracellular ﬂux analysis. A signiﬁcant
decrease in glycolysis, as measured by ECAR, was noted in
activated T cells treated with peg-Arg I, compared with T cells
cultured with peg-BSA (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3A and
S3B). Moreover, a lower glucose-[3-3H] uptake and decreased
expression of the glucose transporter Glut-1 were found in T cells
cultured in the presence of peg-Arg I (Fig. 2B and C), compared
with peg-BSA–treated T cells, suggesting that peg-Arg I blocked
glycolysis in normal activated T cells.

Next, we evaluated the effect of peg-Arg I on mitochondrial
oxidative respiration by measuring OCR. Activated T cells were
cultured in the presence of peg-Arg I or peg-BSA for 24 hours, after
which basal OCR was tested. A similar upregulation of OCR levels
was noted in activated T cells cultured with peg-Arg I or peg-BSA,
compared with nonactivated T cells (Fig. 2D). We then tested
mitochondrial function by evaluating ATP-linked respiration
using the mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin,
maximal respiration using the uncoupling ionophore FCCP, and
nonmitochondrial OCR using the electron transport chain inhibitor rotenone. ATP-linked and nonmitochondrial OCR were similar in the peg-Arg I and peg-BSA–treated T cells, though the pegArg I–treated cells did have a slightly lower OCR reserved capacity
(Fig. 2E). Furthermore, in agreement with the lack of effect of pegArg I on mitochondrial respiration, we noticed a similar production of mitochondrial ROS (MitoSOX) and mitochondrial biogenesis (MitoTracker) in activated T cells cultured with peg-Arg I
or peg-BSA (Fig. 2F and G). Next, we elucidated whether energy
production by mitochondrial respiration is needed for the survival of T cells to peg-Arg I. Addition of oligomycin resulted in a

Suppression of T-cell Responses by L-Arginine Depletion

signiﬁcant increase of apoptosis in peg-Arg I–treated T cells, but
not in controls (Fig. 2H), suggesting the importance of the
mitochondrial ATP production in the survival of normal T cells
to peg-Arg I.
L-Arg

synthesis from citrulline and T-cell resistance to peg-Arg I
De novo synthesis of L-Arg occurs from citrulline and is reliant
upon enzymes ASS-1 and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL; ref. 23).
Because complete culture medium lacks citrulline, we asked
whether the addition of exogenous citrulline or L-Arg rescued the
proliferation arrest induced by peg-Arg I. Addition of citrulline,
but not L-Arg, restored proliferation of T cells cultured in the
presence of peg-Arg I (Fig. 3A). The lack of effect of the supplemented L-Arg can be explained by its immediate metabolism by
peg-Arg I (6). Then, we compared the expression of ASS-1 and ASL
in activated T cells cultured with peg-Arg I or peg-BSA. A similar
expression of both enzymes was observed in T cells independent
of the activation or the presence of peg-Arg I (Fig. 3B). To

understand the role of L-Arg synthesis in the proliferation of T
cells cultured with peg-Arg I and citrulline, we silenced the
expression of ASS-1 using siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S4). Silencing of ASS-1 signiﬁcantly impaired the ability of peg-Arg I–treated
T cells to proliferate in citrulline-supplemented media (Fig. 3C)
without resulting in T-cell apoptosis (Fig. 3D). Because normal T
cells were resistant to peg-Arg I in the presence of citrulline, we
evaluated the availability of citrulline in the serum of peg-Arg I–
treated mice. A dose-dependent increase in citrulline levels was
noted in the serum of mice treated with peg-Arg I, but not in pegBSA controls (Fig. 3E), indicating the elevation of citrulline as a
systemic response to acute L-Arg deprivation in vivo.
MDSCs mediate antiproliferative effects of peg-Arg I in vivo
Because the elevation of citrulline in peg-Arg I–treated mice and
the ability of T cells to produce L-Arg from citrulline, we sought to
determine whether an indirect mechanism was mediating the
impaired T-cell proliferation after peg-Arg I treatment. To test the

potential role of MDSC, CD8þ T cells from CD45.1þ OT-1 mice
were adoptively transferred into cohorts of CD45.2þ mice treated
with peg-Arg I, peg-BSA, or PBS, which received repeated injections with anti–Gr-1 or control IgG antibodies and were immunized with siinfekl. A signiﬁcant restoration in OT-1 cell proliferation was detected in peg-Arg I–treated mice receiving anti–Gr1, but not in those receiving IgG (Fig. 4A), suggesting that MDSC
regulated T-cell suppression induced by peg-Arg I in vivo. In
addition, a dose-dependent accumulation of CD11bþ Gr1þ cells
occurred in spleens of mice treated with peg-Arg I, but not in
those treated with peg-BSA or PBS (Fig. 4B), which correlated
with a higher CD11bþ Gr1þ cell proliferation, as tested by
BrdUrd (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the increase in MDSC by peg-Arg I

treatment was the result of the expansion of granulocyticMDSC (G-MDSC, CD11bþ Ly6Gþ Ly6Clow), but not monocytic-MDSC (M-MDSC, CD11bþ Ly6Gneg Ly6Chigh; Fig. 4D).
To test whether the increase in MDSC was also induced by
deprivation of other amino acids, we studied the effect of
asparagine-metabolizing enzyme peg-asparaginase. A similar
increase in G-MDSC, but not M-MDSC, was found in pegasparaginase–treated mice compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. S5), supporting the effect of amino acid starvation
on MDSC accumulation.
Next, we tested the ability of peg-Arg I–induced CD11bþ Gr1þ
cells to block T-cell responses in vitro. CD11bþ Gr1þ cells isolated
from peg-Arg I–treated mice, but not from those treated with

Suppression of T-cell Responses by L-Arginine Depletion

peg-BSA or PBS, blocked proliferation of activated T cells in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4E). In addition, MDSC from pegArg I–treated mice displayed increased expression of MDSCinhibitory protein arginase I (Fig. 4F) and higher arginase activity
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Also, the addition of arginase inhibitor
nor-NOHA, iNOS inhibitor L-NMMA, or exogenous L-Arg
blocked the increased regulatory effect of peg-Arg I–induced
MDSC (Fig. 4G), suggesting a role of L-Arg metabolism in the
inhibitory function of MDSC induced by peg-Arg I. Next, we tested
the effect of peg-Arg I in the growth of 3LL tumors, a model that
depends upon MDSC (27, 28). An accelerated tumor growth was
found in 3LL-bearing mice treated with peg-Arg I, compared with
mice treated with peg-BSA or PBS (Fig. 4H), which correlated with
higher numbers of MDSC (Fig. 4I). Thus, our results support the
primary role of MDSC in the T-cell suppression induced by L-Arg
starvation in vivo and warrants caution in the use of peg-Arg I as an
antitumor therapy without targeting MDSC accumulation.
Peg-Arg I–induced MDSC accumulation is mediated by GCN2
We aimed to determine the molecular mediators by which pegArg I induced the accumulation of MDSC. Kinase GCN2 is a key
mediator of the effects induced by amino acid starvation
(11, 29, 30, 30–33). Therefore, we sought to examine the effect
of GCN2 in the MDSC induction by peg-Arg I. An impaired
accumulation of MDSC was detected in peg-Arg I–treated
GCN2-deﬁcient mice compared with controls (Fig. 5A), suggesting the key role of GCN2 in the accumulation of MDSC by peg-Arg
I. To determine whether GCN2 also mediated the inhibitory
function of peg-Arg I–induced MDSC, we compared on a per cell
basis the ability of CD11bþ Gr1þ cells from wild-type and GCN2deﬁcient mice to impair T-cell proliferation and to express arginase I. An identical ability to suppress T-cell proliferation and a
similar expression of arginase I were found in sorted MDSC from
wild-type and GCN2-deﬁcient mice treated with peg-Arg I (Fig. 5B
and C), suggesting that GCN2 is involved in the accumulation of
MDSC, but not in the per-cell function of peg-Arg I–induced
MDSC.

Discussion
Previous studies established the therapeutic beneﬁt of peg-Arg I
in various preclinical malignancies (6–10). Moreover, peg-Arg I is
undergoing evaluation in phase I/II trials for adults with liver
carcinoma, with favorable safety proﬁles (34). Because L-Arg
depletion is also an important mechanism for suppression of
T-cell responses in tumors (22), we sought to reconcile these
observations by conducting a detailed analysis of the effects of
peg-Arg I on normal T cells. Our ﬁndings show the regulatory
effect of peg-Arg I on T-cell proliferation and the ability of T cells to
resist peg-Arg I through L-Arg synthesis. In addition, we show the
new role of MDSC in the inhibition of T-cell responses by L-Arg
starvation.
Our ﬁndings showed the ability of T cells to synthesize L-Arg de
novo and indicated the elevation of serum citrulline as a systemic
response to acute depletion of L-Arg. The increased citrulline
synthesis occurring under systemic low arginine levels has been
shown to be mediated by enterocytes using diet-based glutamine
(35–39). Also, in agreement with the role of citrulline after L-Arg
deprivation, injection of citrulline ameliorated toxic effects after
arginase therapy (20). Although our data suggest the role of L-Arg
synthesis in the effects induced by peg-Arg I, we could not

speciﬁcally test the effect of citrulline on T cells or MDSC from
peg-Arg I–treated mice because of the lack of pharmacologic
inhibitors against ASS-1 or ASL, the toxicity of ASS-1 deletion in
mice (40, 41), and the unavailability of conditional ASS-1– or
ASL-deﬁcient mice.
Peg-Arg I blocked malignant T-cell proliferation through the
induction of apoptosis (6), while it failed to trigger cell death in
normal T cells. Survival of normal T cells to peg-Arg I was
mediated by ATP production in the mitochondria. The lack of
this adaptive pathway in malignant cells could explain the differences in apoptosis observed in malignant versus normal T cells
treated with peg-Arg I. In fact, tumor cells are mostly dependent on
aerobic glycolysis, whereas normal cells retain the ability to sense
stress and maintain survival through mitochondrial-mediated
pathways (42). Our results also showed that peg-Arg I did not
impair activation processes or mitochondrial respiration in T cells.
However, the role of T-cell activation in the low proliferation
induced by peg-Arg I is still unknown, in part because of the

difﬁculty to separating proliferation and activation processes.
Previous research showed the importance of fatty acid oxidation
and mitochondrial respiration on the proliferation of regulatory T
cells (2). Therefore, it is possible that regulatory T cells are less
susceptible to peg-Arg I, which could also contribute to the
tolerogenic effects induced by L-Arg starvation.
We found that in addition to the potential suppression of T cells
by MDSC-mediated L-Arg deprivation, L-Arg starvation also promotes accumulation of MDSC, further suppressing antitumor Tcell responses. Accordingly, peg-Arg I mimicked T-cell suppression induced by physical injury, a process also mediated by MDSC
(16). Although immune suppression could be a major limitation
for the use of peg-Arg I as a therapy in cancer, it may also lead to
novel therapies in transplantation and autoimmune diseases. In
these settings, peg-Arg I could maintain a permanent inﬂux of
MDSC to provide T-cell suppression. As such, peg-Arg I prolonged
mice survival after bone marrow transplantation and prevented
development of GVHD similar to mice receiving adoptive transfer
of MDSC (15). With regard to the use of peg-Arg I in different
cancers, peg-Arg I could be combined with chemotherapy agents
that block MDSC accumulation and function, such as gemcitabine (43), 5-ﬂuorouracil (44), and sunitinib (45). Furthermore,
we found a role of GCN2 in the accumulation of MDSC in peg-Arg
I–treated mice. Accordingly, previous studies indicated the role of
GCN2 in the immune effects induced by L-asparaginase (30, 46).
However, the intracellular mechanisms by which the depletion of
L-Arg and its sensing pathways promote MDSC accumulation
remain unknown. Possible pathways could include the induction
of factors that promote MDSC accumulation, including VEGF,
S100A8/A9, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), and G-CSF. Also, in agreement with the role of cellular
stress in the regulation of myeloid cells function and accumulation, recent studies showed the effect of L-Arg starvation on
macrophage responses to infections (41) and the speciﬁc role of
stress mediators in the induction of VEGF, arginase I (47), and
MDSC accumulation (48) in tumors.
In summary, our results show for the ﬁrst time the role of MDSC
in the suppression of T-cell function caused by L-Arg starvation.

This increases the understanding of the effects of L-Arg deprivation
in the regulation of antitumor immunity and suggests caution for
the use of peg-Arg I in malignancies without targeting MDSC
accumulation.
