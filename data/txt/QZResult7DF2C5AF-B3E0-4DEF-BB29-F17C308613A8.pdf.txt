Abstract
Gastroenteropancreatic
neuroendocrine
neoplasms
(GEP-NENs)
are
heterogeneous tumors that need to be molecularly defined to obtain novel therapeutic
options. Forkheadbox protein M1 (FOXM1) is a crucial transcription factor in neoplastic
cells and has been associated with differentiation and proliferation. We found that
FOXM1 is strongly associated with tumor differentiation and occurrence of metastases
in gastrointestinal NENs. In vitro inhibition by the FOXM1 inhibitor siomycin A led
to down-regulation of mitotic proteins and resulted in a strong inhibitory effect.
Siomycin A decreased mitosis rate, induced apoptosis in GEP-NEN cell lines and exerts
synergistic effects with chemotherapy. FOXM1 is associated with clinical outcome
and FOXM1 inhibition impairs survival in vitro. We therefore propose FOXM1 as novel
therapeutic target in GEP-NENs.

Introduction

cancerogenesis, FOXM1 has been demonstrated to
contribute to all hallmarks of cancer [2-6]. It is considered
a key regulator of the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and
of the mitotic spindle integrity by regulation of cyclin A
and B, cdc25B, aurora A and B kinases, survivin, PLK1,
SKP2, CENPB and CENPF/A/B, and degradation of
p21 and p27 [3, 4, 6-13]. FOXM1 also triggers cancer
progression by promoting a VEGF-dependent angiogenic
switch [14, 15] and by facilitating invasion via MMP-2
and MMP-9 secretion [16-18]. FOXM1 can be repressed
by wild type p53 [19] and by FOXO3a [20-22]. It is then
a further downstream effector of the PI3K-AKT-FOXO-

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasias
(GEP-NENs) are heterogeneous tumors of the
gastrointestinal system and the pancreas with limited
therapeutic options, possibly due to crosstalks that reactivate mitogen signaling [1]. The search for novel
“druggable” targets, therapeutic strategies and prognostic
markers remains a considerable challenge.
Forkheadbox protein M1 (FOXM1) is regarded
to be a crucial transcription factor in a plethora of solid
cancers. As one of the early up-regulated proteins in

Table 1: Summary of the most relevant results of the immunohistochemical analyses: number of analyzed specimens
is indicated in the table: 88 gastrointestinal NEN specimens were stained for FOXM1, 49 and 36 pancreatic and
gastrointestinal cases were analyzed for survivin and STAT3, respectively. Lower numbers in the metastatic status analyses

resulted from 3 cases with unknown status. All markers could be associated with metastatic status, and FOXM1 and nuclear survivin could
be significantly linked to differentiation. FOXM1 further significantly correlated with survivin and STAT3 high nuclear staining.

axis, which is frequently deregulated in GEP-NENs [1,
23, 24]. It is also regulated by cell cycle proteins such
as CDK4/6 [25]. The role of FOXM1 in neuroendocrine
neoplasms has rarely been explored to date, but it has been
recently described as marker for subtyping neuroendocrine
lung cancer [26].
In this study we demonstrate that FOXM1
expression is associated with proliferation, differentiation
and metastasis in gastrointestinal NEN and that inhibition
of FOXM1 is a potential new therapeutic option.

marker Ki-67 (p=0.000, Fig. 1 E and F).
In a subsequent univariate analysis, we could also
demonstrate that FOXM1 expression is associated with
the occurrence of metastasis in gastrointestinal NENs as
4/49 (8.2%) of the M0 subgroup and 11/36 (30.6%) of
the M1 subgroup showed high FOXM1 expression (N=85;
p=0.007).

FOXM1 is up-regulated jointly with STAT3 and
survivin in GEP-NEN

Results

In order to determine how FOXM1 is co-regulated
with other oncogenes, we chose (potential) upstream and
downstream mediator of FOXM1. Immunohistochemical
analysis was used to determine the expression status of
STAT3 in 36 and of survivin in 49 cases of pancreatic and
gastrointestinal NENs, respectively. The high FOXM1
expression could be linked to a high survivin nuclear
localization (fisher’s test: p=0.030; for gastrointestinal
NENs only: p=0,029) which was up-regulated in 16/49
(32.7%) cases [27] of the study and was associated with
both, differentiation and metastatic status (both: p=0.000).
High FOXM1 expression could further be linked to
STAT3 nuclear localization (Figure 1D) in a fisher’s exact
test (p=0.001; for gastrointestinal NENs only: p=0.005).
Nuclear STAT3 furthermore correlated with metastatic
status in NENs (p=0,007; for gastrointestinal NENs only:
p=0.034). In a multivariate analysis we analyzed the
dependency of metastatic status from STAT3 and FOXM1
expression. In a binary logistic regression, STAT3 was
determined to be an independent parameter with an
odds ratio of 6.72 (p=0.011) in forward and backward
stepwise regression, indicating that FOXM1 may be under
transcriptional control of STAT3.
A correlation between FOXM1 and cytoplasmic
survivin (p=1.00) or cytoplasmic STAT3 (p>0.428) and
with phospho STAT3 (p>0.072) expression were not
significant in our analyses (data not shown).
The strong correlation of FOXM1 and STAT3

FOXM1expression correlates with differentiation
and metastasis in gastrointestinal NENs
First, we assessed the clinical relevancy of FOXM1
in GEP-NEN tumor specimens (summarized in table 1).
High FOXM1 staining (Figure 1) was detected in 30/131
(22.9%) of the GEP-NENs tissues. As only 3 specimens
of the pancreatic subgroup were poorly differentiated,
we focused on the analysis of the 88 specimens of
gastrointestinal primary localization.
In this group, FOXM1 expression correlated
with tumor differentiation according to WHO 2010
classification (refer to table 2). In an univariate analysis,
we found that 9/72 (12.5%) of the well-differentiated (G1
and G2) and 6/16 (37.5%) of the poorly-differentiated
(G3) specimens had high FOXM1 expression (fisher’s
exact test: p=0.026). Interestingly, we found a strong
difference of FOXM1 expression between G1 (5.5%)
and G2 (35.3%) well-differentiated gastrointestinal
NENs (fisher’s exact test: p=0.004). The latter FOXM1
expression was similar to those tumors with G3 grading.
Accordingly, gastrointestinal NENs can be subgrouped
by a strong FOXM1 expression increase with the most
significant cut off between 2% to 4% of the proliferation

Siomycin A treatment induces regulation of
proteins that are involved in GEP-NEN tumor
biology

expression could be confirmed in lysates obtained from
frozen primary and metastasis tumor material of GEPNEN patients. Here, FOXM1 was significantly associated
with STAT3 expression (p=0.000; Figure 2A). We could
further detect a tendency of FOXM1 and STAT3 to be
higher expressed in the metastasis group of tumor tissue
than in the primary tumor group (Figure 2). We therefore
show that STAT3 and FOXM1 in GEP-NENs may have
prognostic significance.

In our preliminary experiments, we have
demonstrated that FOXM1 is expressed in GEP-NENs to
a high extent and can be correlated to differentiation and
the occurrence of metastasis in gastrointestinal NEN. Until
now, effective therapy options for these tumors are not
available. We therefore analyzed the effect of proteasome
inhibitors, which target FOXM1 [28-31], in vitro. To
initiate our studies, we assessed the basal expression
of FOXM1 in the GEP NEN cell lines BON, QGP-1,
KRJ-1, LCC-18 by western blot. All cell lines expressed
detectable levels of FOXM1 (Figure 3A).
We chose the natural thiazole antibiotic, siomycin A
and evaluated its effect on FOXM1 expression in treated
GEP-NEN cell lines. We could demonstrate that FOXM1
was down-regulated time-dependently in all cell lines
and that the cell cycle regulator p21 was up-regulated
simultaneously (Figure 3B). Siomycin A is thus competent
to inhibit FOXM1 in GEP-NEN cell lines and might
influence the cell cycle regulation of GEP-NEN cells.
Chromogranin A is a common clinical
neuroendocrine marker. Aurora kinases and survivin
are mitosis associated proteins, the latter with a strong
prognostic potential in GEP-NENs. Through western
blot analyses, we found that chromogranin A, survivin,
and aurora A were synchronously down-regulated after
siomycin A treatment (Figure 3C). FOXM1 dependent
down-regulation of aurora A and chromogranin A could
be further confirmed by determining the expression after
knockdown of FOXM1 by RNA interference (Figure 3D).
Everolimus did not exert mentionable effects on FOXM1
expression (Figure 3E), as it affects the mTOR signaling
and is not considered to be involved in FOXM1 regulation.
Interestingly, we found STAT3 also down-regulated
under siomycin A treatment, which reveals some insight
into the mode of action of this natural agent (Figure 2B).

Siomycin A treatment induces antiproliferative
effects on GEP-NEN cell lines in vitro

Figure 2: Role of STAT3 expression. A. Primary
tumor samples were lysed, analyzed by western blot in three
independent experiments and densitometrically assessed.
Statistical evaluation was done by linear multivariable regression
and by non-parametric Mann-Whitney U Test, respectively. On
tissue level, FOXM1 expression strongly correlated with STAT3
expression (R square= 0.823, adjusted R square=0.816) by
linear regression. STAT3 is therefore associated with FOXM1
expression. A tendency of both proteins to be expressed to a
higher extent in metastasis, compared to primary tumor material
can be assumed, but requires a larger number of tumor samples.
B. BON, QGP-1 and LCC-18 cell lines were treated with 2 and
3.5µM siomycin A for 72h. Cells were lysed and lysates were
prepared by western blot. Immunodetection of STAT3 showed a
strong decrease of STAT3 expression after siomycin A treatment
in all cell lines.

To assess siomycin A not only as modulator of
neuroendocrine markers and proliferation regulators,
but also as effective treatment option for GEP-NENs,
we calculated the dose of half maximal inhibitory effect
(IC50) of siomycin A and everolimus for each GEP-NEN
cell line (Suppl. 1). Everolimus was chosen because it is
one of only 3 molecular therapy options that have been
approved for GEP-NEN treatment. The IC50 of siomycin
A was determined as ~1µM for BON and LCC-18 cells
and ~2µM for QGP-1 cells and are consistent with the
already published IC50 values for this natural agent in
other cells lines in vitro [32]. We could not determine

Siomycin A reduces mitosis and induces apoptosis
in GEP-NEN cell lines in vitro

an IC50 for KRJ-1 cells due to the interference of native
cellular clustering of this non-adherent cell line. We
hypothesize that the surface cell layer of the spherical cell
clusters protected the inner cells from the treatment and
gave an incalculable growth advantage increasing with the
size of the clusters. For these cells we estimated an IC50
similar to those of the other GEP NEN cell lines.
We could demonstrate a significant antiproliferative
effect of siomycin A on GEP-NEN cell lines p=0.000;
Figure 4). Siomycin A is therefore superior even to equal
doses of everolimus, which only showed significant impact
on the cell lines BON (p=0.008) and LCC-18 (p=0.000),
whereas QGP-1 (p=0.092) and KRJ-1 (p= 0.38) did not
significantly respond to everolimus even in concentrations
equal to siomycin A treatment (Figure 4).

As FOXM1 is strongly associated with mitotic
regulation, we wanted to understand the impact of
siomycin A on the cell cycle of GEP-NEN cells. After
96h of treatment, the majority of BON, and LCC-18 and
a large population of KRJ-1 cells analyzed by mitotic
index flow cytometry, have undergone apoptosis or
necrosis (indicated as Sub-G1) and showed a significantly
decreased mitotic population (p<0.001; Figure 5). QGP1 cells only showed a moderate increase in apoptotic or
necrotic cells and an average 6-fold decrease of the mitotic
cell population could be detected (Figure 5 and Suppl. 2).
To distinguish whether cells undergo apoptosis or
necrosis, we completed our analyses by an LDH-based
cytotoxicity assay. Siomycin A in effective doses showed

Figure 3: Western blot analysis of FOXM1 and potential target expression in GEP-NEN cell lines. All cell lines including

the non-neuroendocrine HT-29 and the FOXM1 overexpressing U2OS control cell lines expressed FOXM1 A. KRJ-1 cells, which is the
only wild type TP53 GEP-NEN cell line in this study (unpublished data) expressed the lowest level of FOXM1. After short time (12h)
treatment with 10µM siomycin A, an increase of p21 expression was detected in a time-dependent manner B. Treatment of synchronized
GEP-NEN cell lines with 2 and 3.5µM siomycin A for 72 hours resulted in a decrease of FOXM1, chromogranin A, aurora A and survivin
expression C. Dependency of chromogranin A and aurora A down-regulation from FOXM1 depletion could be verifed by RNA interference
with two different siRNAs targeting FOXM1 mRNA D. in BON and QGP-1 cells. Treatment with 2µM everolimus for 72 hours did not
remarkably reduce FOXM1 expression E.

a low cytotoxic effect on BON, QGP-1 and LCC-18
(Figure 6 A-C). Only in KRJ-1 there were strong cytotoxic
effects, presumably due to the loss of intercellular contact.
As resuspending the cell clusters was obligatory for equal
cell numbers and the time of incubation was too short for a
reattachment, induction of anoikis might be an explanation
for an early and strong loss of membrane integrity (Figure
6D).
We conclude that siomycin A predominantly induces
a decrease of mitotic activity and apoptosis in GEP-NEN
cell lines and its in vivo tolerability should be further
assessed in animal studies.

the effect of siomycin A combined with cisplatin
or temozolomide versus everolimus combined with
chemotherapy. 10µM cisplatin induced moderate
inhibitory effects in WST proliferation studies. 10µM
Temozolomide did not inhibit cellular proliferation in
BON, QGP-1 and LCC-18 cells and showed a moderate
antiproliferative effect in KRJ-1 cells. Quantitated by the
combination index method after Chou and Talalay [35,
36], we found slight synergistic to synergistic effects in
all cell lines for 0.1µM everolimus combined with 10µM
cisplatin after 72 hours of treatment (Figure 7). This
favorable combination has been described before [37]
and could be reproduced for GEP-NENs in this study.
Nevertheless, even the combined everolimus treatment
was less effective than the siomycin A monotherapy in all
cell lines. Everolimus combined to temozolomide did not
show enhanced effects.
2 or 3 µM Siomycin A combined to 10 or 5µM
cisplatin, respectively, induced nearly additive to very
strong synergistic inhibitory effects in GEP-NEN cell
lines. Interestingly, the effect of siomycin A combined

Siomycin A might not be used in monotherapy
regimens, but inhibition of FOXM1 has been already
assessed to have synergistic effects combined with
genotoxic drugs [19, 33, 34]. We therefore examined

and LCC-18 D. cells were treated with increasing concentrations (1µM, 2µM, 5µM) of siomycin A and (0.1µM,1µM, 5µM) everolimus
for 24, 48 and 72 hours and analyzed by colorimetric proliferation assays (graphs in percent of internal DMSO controls). Siomycin A
significantly inhibits GEP-NEN cell proliferation (p=0.000) and was superior to everolimus treatment in all cell lines. Antiproliferative
effects could be shown for concentration ≥1µM in BON, KRJ 1, LCC 18 and ≥2µM for QGP-1 cells in relation to DMSO internal controls
and were verified in a linear regression analysis. KRJ-1 cells showed a strong variance in the response due to intercellular clustering effects.
Nevertheless these changes were highly significant (p=0.000). Representative data of one experiment is shown. Dotted lines indicate 100%
and 10% of control.

to temozolomide was antagonistic in pancreatic BON
(Figure 7A) and QGP-1 cells (Figure 7B), whereas the
gastrointestinal cell lines KRJ-1 (Figure 7C) and LCC18 (Figure 7D) responded with synergistically reduced
proliferation. Siomycin A combined to everolimus induced
antagonistic effects and increased cellular proliferation in
relation to DMSO controls (data not shown).

GEP-NENs, in particular tumors that originate in
the gut, lack tailored molecular therapies and biomarkers.
Interestingly, the expression of several proteins, such as
survivin, aurora kinases, p16(INK4A) and IGF-1, have
been found altered in GEP-NENs, and are associated
with FOXM1 expression in other cancer entities [38-40].
FOXM1 has further been described as a crucial protooncogene. There are currently few prognostic markers and

therapeutic options, especially in the NENs of the gut, and
prognosis is only associated with the proliferation index
indicated by Ki-67. We therefore assessed FOXM1 as a
potential disease progression marker and therapy target.
We found FOXM1 significantly up-regulated in
poorly differentiated tumors (p=0.026). FOXM1 could
not be validated as a significant independent marker.
This result may be due to its crucial role in mitosis and
proliferation, which would influence the expression of
proliferation markers, such as Ki-67.
Interestingly, the correlation of FOXM1 expression
and Ki-67 staining reveals a low expression in the G1graded tumors and FOXM1 expression significantly
increases in the tumor subgroup with a Ki-67 value higher
than 2-4% (p=0.000). There is currently an unclear Ki67 cut-off value to distinguish G1 and G2 GEP-NENs,
since former WHO classifications stated Ki-67 cut-off
values from 2 to 5%, which were dependent from the
localization of the primary tumor (WHO2000/2004).
As Ki-67 is only a descriptive marker, these changes in

the FOXM1 transcription factor expression might give a
mechanistic explanation for the distinct clinical prognoses
of both subgroups. Therefore, FOXM1 might serve as a
secondary refining marker to discriminate between G1 and
G2 gastrointestinal NENs.
FOXM1 expression could also be related to
the occurrence of metastases (p=0.007) and showed
a tendency to be up-regulated in primary metastases
material. Therefore, we could show that FOXM1 is a
progression associated protein in GEP-NENs. These data
are consistent with already published results for FOXM1
as oncogene in many other cancer entities [41-43].
FOXM1 is described as a transcriptional target of
STAT3 [44]. Here, we demonstrate that FOXM1 is upregulated jointly with nuclear STAT3 in GEP-NENs.
Although being localized in the nucleus, stained STAT3 molecules were not consistently phosphorylated, as
the parallel immunohistochemical staining with the
phospho-STAT3 antibody was highly variable (data not
shown). We hypothesize that STAT3 might transactivate

with 1 and 2µM siomycin A versus 0.04% DMSO, 0.01µM Everolimus and 1% Triton X (total cell lysis control) for 4 and 24 hours. LDH
release from necrotic cells was colorimetrically measured in % of Triton X lysed cell control by LDH cytotoxicity assay. Dotted line

the range of 20%. Only KRJ-1 cells had higher cytotoxicity values up to 63%. Further studies should be performed to assess the in vivo
tolerability of siomycin A.

FOXM1 expression in GEP-NENs. These results may be
reflected in recent studies showing that unphosphorylated
STAT3 (U-STAT3) can be shuttled into the nucleus by
importin-alpha3 and -alpha6 and is crucially involved in
cancer signal transduction [45]. It has been demonstrated
to cooperate with other transcription factors such as
unphosphorylated NF-kappaB to bind to DNA and
transactivate target genes [46, 47]. Furthermore,
U-STAT3 can mediate FOXO3a nuclear export and thus
FOXO3a inactivation and FOXM1 activation, whereas
phosphorylated STAT3 re-localizes FOXO3a into the

nucleus and therefore promotes its FOXM1 antagonistic
activity [48].
Thiazole compounds, such as siomycin A, have
been assessed as promising FOXM1 inhibitors with
little impact on untransformed cells [49]. In general,
proteasome inhibitors might stabilize a hypothetical
negative regulator of FOXM1 [29, 32, 50]. In this study,
siomycin A treatment decreases the expression of both,
STAT3 and FOXM1, although the mechanism of action
is relatively unknown [4, 29, 30]. Therefore it is possible
that the proteasome inhibitor sioymcin A targets FOXM1

Proliferation was analyzed by colorimetric WST proliferation assays (graphs in percent of internal DMSO controls) and mean combination
index was calculated using the Chou and Talalay method by CompuSyn 1.0 software [35, 36]. Everolimus combined to cisplatin showed
slight synergism to synergism (BON: CI=0.864; QGP-1: CI=0.457; KRJ-1: n.d.; LCC 18: CI=0.862) after 72 hours of treatment. Siomycin
A combined to cisplatin induced nearly additive effects to very strong synergisms in GEP-NEN cell lines (BON: CI=0.996; QGP-1:
CI=0.548; KRJ-1: CI=1.066; LCC-18: CI=0.062) and the combination with temozolomide was antagonistic in pancreatic BON (CI=1.538)
and QGP-1 cells (CI=2.627), and synergistic in gastrointestinal KRJ-1 (CI=0.526) and LCC-18 (CI=0.645) cell lines. (Captions [35]: very

indirectly by a JNK-STAT3-dependent mechanism [31,
51]. This may explain the effectiveness of siomycin A, as
STAT3 has been shown to interfere with FOXO proteins
[48]. Thus, siomycin A might interfere with STAT3, which
contributes to FOXO3a nuclear localization and results in
FOXM1 repression and inhibition of mitosis.
In our study we have further confirmed that
survivin and aurora kinases are FOXM1 targets. This is
not a novel result, but as aurora kinases have previously
been described as druggable targets in GEP-NENs [52,
53], novel combinatory treatments are conceivable.
Furthermore, the fact that aurora A kinase and survivin
are down-regulated under FOXM1 inhibition supports
the notion that the mitotic instability, and not the (in-)
activation of various kinases, may be the better approach
for the treatment of GEP-NENs.
Independently from its impact on neuroendocrine
tumor signaling, we could show the natural agent
siomycin A as effective therapeutic option when applied
in the range of 1-2µM. We hypothesize that the higher
IC50 values in QGP-1 are related to a TP53 frameshift
mutation and thus loss of p53 expression (unpublished
data) which impairs apoptosis induction. In all cell
lines, siomycin A shows a strong maximum effect, but
presumably due to its pharmacochemical characteristics,
it must be applied in relatively high doses in vitro [32].
Notably, is has been described not to affect normal cells
[29, 49, 54, 55]. We could demonstrate that siomycin A
treatment reduces mitosis and induces low unspecific
cell cytotoxicity in three cell lines. We further showed
beneficial combinatory effects combined to cisplatin in
all cell lines and combined with temozolomide in the
gastrointestinal cells. As FOXM1 expression is critically
linked to DNA damage signaling and p53 status [33, 56],
subtype specific prediction markers for combined therapy
approaches should be further evaluated.
Therefore, the inhibition of FOXM1 by proteasome
inhibitors is a potential therapeutic option in GEP-NENs
which should be further evaluated.
In conclusion, we could demonstrate an association
of FOXM1 with the proliferation index indicated by
Ki-67 and with mitotic proteins that have been assessed
as crucial players in GEP-NEN biology [27, 52, 53].
This effect could be confirmed by an overall decreased
mitotic activity in cells after siomycin A treatment. We
have further linked FOXM1 to STAT3 expression and
metastasis.
Finally, we have demonstrated that FOXM1
inhibition by siomycin A showed a stronger effect on the
tested GEP-NEN cell lines than everolimus. Given the fact
that everolimus is a well-established therapy in pancreatic
NENs, but its efficacy is limited, we propose a potential
for the assessment of a combination therapy with FOXM1
inhibitors. FOXM1 inhibition should be also considered
as a (combinatory) therapeutic approach especially in
gastrointestinal NENs, where effective therapeutic options
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are currently not available. In this context, our data further
provide a strong rationale for assessing other proteasome
inhibitors, such as casticin, thiostrepton and bortezomib
[36, 37] as therapeutic strategies.
In conclusion, FOXM1 may serve as a clinical
prognostic factor and a therapeutic target for GEP-NENs.

Materials and methods
Patients and samples
For immunohistochemical analysis, 131 paraffin
embedded specimens of pancreatic (n=43), ileal (n=51),
colorectal (n=30) and gastric (n=7) neuroendocrine
neoplasms have been retrospectively analyzed for
FOXM1 expression. Cases (age 17-87 years) were
collected and prepared as tissue microarray (TMA) at
Universitätsklinikum Jena (n=82) and as whole section
(3-5µm) tissue slides at Charité-Universitätsmedizin
Berlin (n=49), respectively, with permission of the local
ethical committees. The TMA was assembled using 0.6
cm punch biopsies from all samples according to standard
procedures [57]. Five-year follow-up was complete in all
131 cases. Inclusion criteria for this study were: positive
staining for neuroendocrine markers and availability
of clinicopathological information. Tumors were reclassified and Ki-67 re-stained according to the WHO
2010 classification: 85 patients had G1 neuroendocrine
neoplasms, 27 patients suffered from G2 NEN. 19 patients
were diagnosed to have a G3 neuroendocrine cancer.
Further clinicopathological information can be found in
table 2 and supplement 3.
In addition, 36 specimens of the whole section
cohort were selected for further staining against STAT3
and phospho-STAT3. Nuclear survivin (N=49) has been
stained in the same cohort before [27].
In a further prospective study, 44 tissue samples
of fresh frozen material of GEP-NENs derived from 15
patients were collected at the Department of General and
Visceral Surgery at the Zentralklinik Bad Berka GmbH
between 2009 and 2013 with an institutional review
board approval for guidelines and ethical procedures. The
diagnosis of NEN was based on immunohistochemical
characterization of chromogranin A and synaptophysin
expression, on proliferation index (Ki-67) and on
morphological criteria according to the WHO 2010
grading classification. On-site fresh frozen tissue
specimens were H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) stained and
analyzed for tumor cell ratio and morphological features
such as high immune cell invasion or vascularization.
Only samples with tumor cell content higher than 80
percent were included. The samples were mechanically
homogenized and lysed in NP-40 buffer.
Data derived from different samples of the same
8194

tumor were aggregated and mean values were calculated.
Total number of analyzed tumors thus results in 26.
Further clinicopathological data is provided in supplement
4.

V3.1. Values of three independent experiments were
normalized to an internal control and statistical assessment
was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 20.

Immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded
specimens

Cell lines
The following GEP-NEN cell lines were used for
in vitro experiments: pancreatic: BON [58] and QGP1 [59]; obtained from Japanese Collection of Research
Bioresources), ileal: KRJ-1 [60] and colonic: LCC-18
[61].
All cell lines were authenticated (if indicated
as unique) by genetic STR typing by the DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany in 2012 and 2013 and only
cells passaged not longer than 15 passages after receipt
were used. Cells were tested periodically for maintained
cell line specific expression of neuroendocrine markers
(chromogranin A, synaptophysin, cytokeratin, vimentin,
syntaxin) by immunofluorescence microscopy. All cell
lines were grown in Quantum 263 for tumor cells (GE
Healthcare Munich, Germany) including 1% penicillin/
streptomycin or in cell line specific medium (containing
10% FBS gold and 1% penicillin/streptomycin): BON and
KRJ-1 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient
Mixture 1:1 F-12 (DMEM/F12) with stable glutamine,
QGP-1 were cultured in RPMI 1640 with stable glutamine
and LCC-18 were grown in DMEM 4.5g/l glucose with
stable glutamine. The non-neuroendocrine HT-29 and the
FOXM1 overexpressing U2OS cell lines were used as
controls, if indicated.

Immunohistochemistry was performed by APAAP
method. Antibody (FOXM1 C-20) was obtained from
Santa Cruz Inc. and diluted to a working concentration
of 2µg/ml. The scoring of FOXM1 was assessed by
1.) administration of a nuclear (based on a previously
described method for FOXM1 nuclear staining in
neuroendocrine lung cancer [26] and a cytoplasmic score;
2.) integrating both in one overall score. The cytoplasmic
FOXM1 immunoreactivity was assessed as 0 (no staining),
1 (weak staining), 2 (moderate staining) and 3 (strong
staining). Only moderate and high staining was included
in the FOXM1 cytoplasmic positive score. Due to the
fact that FOXM1 cytoplasmic staining is described as
important parameter [62] and FOXM1 nuclear staining
was presumed to be the more critical marker overall, thus
we created a dichotomized score with a proper weighting
of both parameters. Here, nuclear and cytoplasmic scores
were summated and a score of “2” was defined as high
staining. Consequently, both nuclear and cytoplasmic
staining had to be 2 or greater to be assessed as “high
FOXM1” expression. Immunohistochemical evaluation
was done by two independent experts (P.G. and R.A.).
STAT3 antibody was obtained from BD biosciences
and diluted to 1:100; phospho-(Tyr705)-STAT3 antibody
was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and
administered in a 1:50 dilution. Score was assessed
separately for nuclear and cytoplasmic staining as 0 (no),
1 (weak), 2 (moderate), 3 (strong) immunoreactivity.
To dichotomize this variable, only moderate and high
staining were included as STAT3 high expression. Scores
and utilized antibodies for survivin have been previously
described [27].

Western blot
SDS page and western blot of NP-40 lysed material
was performed using a standard protocol and documented
by ponceau S staining. Primary antibodies (obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Danvers, MA, USA: panactin (D18C11), phospho-Tyr705-STAT3; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc. Dallas, Texas, USA: FOXM1 (C-20),
p21; GeneTex Inc. Irvine, CA, USA: GAPDH; Abcam plc
Cambridge, UK: aurora A; PROGEN GmbH Heidelberg:
chromogranin A (klon LK2H10)); BD Transduction
Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA: STAT3; SigmaAldrich: beta-tubulin) and secondary antibodies (Dako
Deutschland GmbH, Hamburg, Germany: swine anti
rabbit IgG-HRP, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc: donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP) were
applied. Antibody binding was detected with ECL™
prime Western Blotting detection reagent (Amersham™
GE healthcare) and documented by Fujifilm LAS-4000
luminescent image analyzer. For re-probing, membranes
were incubated in acidic glycine buffer (0.2 M glycine,
1% SDS, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 2.2). Chemiluminescence
signals were densitometrically detected with Multi Gauge
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analyses
Correlation analyses of continuous variables were
analyzed by multivariate linear regression in forward and
backward stepwise regression. For univariate analyses
containing one or two dichotomized variables, the MannWhitney U test or the χ2 test were applied, respectively.
For results with low expected counts due to low sample
numbers, we applied the exact fisher’s test, if possible.
Multivariate analysis with dichotomized dependent
variables was performed by binary logistic regression in
forward and backward regression. Overall survival was
estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, starting from
the time of diagnosis. The survival was evaluated by the
Mantel-Cox log-rank test and in a multivariate analysis

by Cox regression. Differences were considered to be
significant for p < 0.05. All statistical analyzes were
performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software.

Cells were grown, synchronized by reduced serum
supply and seeded in quintuplets in 96 well plates. Cells
were synchronously treated with increasing concentrations
of Siomycin A, everolimus, cisplatin (Charité Berlin
dispensary) or temozolomide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc.) and 0.1% DSMO, respectively, to obtain dose
response curves as recommended by the Chou-Talalay
method [35]. Additionally, several non-constant
combinations of >IC50 concentrations of siomycin A or
everolimus and cisplatin or temozolomide were assessed.
WST-1 proliferation assay (Roche; Basel, Switzerland)
was performed colorimetrically quantified. Data was
analyzed by CompuSyn 1.0 at Fa=0.5 [63] and IBM SPSS
Statistics 22 software.

GEP-NEN cell lines treatment with siomycin A vs.
everolimus
For cell cycle synchronization, cells were incubated
in 10µM thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA; in culture media) for 72 hours or starved 24 hours
in culture medium containing 0.01% FBS.
Siomycin A was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and
dissolved in DMSO. Everolimus as control therapy was
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. For proliferation
and cytotoxicity assays, 10000-20000 cells per well were
used in quintuplets in 96 well plates and treated 4 and 24h
for LDH and 24, 48 and 72h for WST-assay with different
concentrations and controls. WST-1 proliferation reagent
and LDH cytotoxicity detection reagent (Roche; Basel,
Switzerland) were applied according to the manufactures’
instructions. In the LDH assay, 3% FBS was used
instead of 1%, as recommended in the instructions. Cell
density was colorimetrically quantified with a multi-well
spectrophotometer (TECAN sunrise™).
