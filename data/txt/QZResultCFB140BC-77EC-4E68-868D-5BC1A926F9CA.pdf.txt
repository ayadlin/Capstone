BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy of imatinib plus hydroxyurea in patients with progressive/recurrent lowgrade glioma. METHODS: A total of 64 patients with recurrent/progressive low-grade glioma were enrolled in this single-center study that stratified patients into astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma cohorts. All patients received 500
mg of hydroxyurea twice a day. Imatinib was administered at 400 mg per day for patients not on enzyme-inducing
antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) and at 500 mg twice a day if on EIAEDs. The primary endpoint was progression-free
survival at 12 months (PFS-12) and secondary endpoints were safety, median progression-free survival, and radiographic response rate. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled into each cohort. Eleven patients (17%) had before
radiotherapy and 24 (38%) had received before chemotherapy. The median PFS and PFS-12 were 11 months and 39%,
respectively. Outcome did not differ between the histologic cohorts. No patient achieved a radiographic response.
The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events were neutropenia (11%), thrombocytopenia (3%), and diarrhea
(3%). CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib plus hydroxyurea was well tolerated among recurrent/progressive LGG patients but

INTRODUCATION
Low-grade gliomas (LGGs), a histologically diverse group of progressively infiltrative primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors including astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma, most commonly affect children
and young to middle-aged adults. Although some historical reports have misnomered these tumors as benign, most likely
due to growth rates as low as 3 to 5 mm/y,1,2 LGGs can extensively infiltrate and cause progressive neurologic deficits,
marked cognitive impairment, and personality changes as well as recalcitrant seizures. In addition, many will eventually
transform to high-grade histology.3 Median survival for most LGG subtypes is 5 to 10 years.4,5
Optimal therapy for LGG remains undefined. Maximum safe resection can palliate symptoms and improve prognosis,6 but is not curative. Among newly diagnosed patients, postsurgical treatment is typically reserved for newly diagnosed
patients with poor prognostic features including age over 40 years, poor performance status, tumors that are large or unresectable, and nonoligodendroglial histology.7,8 For such patients, as well as those with progressive or recurrent tumors,
radiotherapy has historically been regarded as appropriate initial therapy. Although radiotherapy successfully achieves tumor control in most cases, it is also associated with potential late sequellae including cognitive decline, neuroendocrine
dysfunction, radiation-induced necrosis, vasculopathy, cortical atrophy, secondary malignancy, and diminished quality of
life.9-15 Due to these concerns, several chemotherapy options have been increasingly evaluated for LGG patients including

PCV (procarbazine, carmustine, and vincristine), carboplatin, and temozolomide.16-24 Chemotherapy strategies
have demonstrated sufficient benefit to generate ongoing,
randomized phase III studies.
A general therapeutic strategy of significant interest
in the current oncology era is the inhibition of biologically
relevant growth factors and cell signaling mediators. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a (PDGFR-a) expression is increased in some LGG.25-29 In addition, PDGFR
signaling is linked with several aspects of glioma biology
including astrocytoma proliferation30 and neural stem/
progenitor cell transformation.31
In the current manuscript we describe the first evaluation of a targeted therapeutic in the treatment of LGG.
Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, formerly STI-571), a selective receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of PDGF receptors,
Bcr-Abl, c-KIT, and c-fms, has established activity against
both hematologic and solid organ cancers.32 We performed a phase II study to evaluate the antitumor activity
as well as safety of imatinib administered in combination
with hydroxyurea, a ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase
inhibitor, for patients with recurrent or progressive LGG.
Our results demonstrate that imatinib plus hydroxyurea is well tolerated but has negligible activity for
patients with progressive or recurrent LGG.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Treatment
We conducted an open-label, single-center, phase II trial.
The primary end point was 12-month progression-free survival (PFS), whereas secondary end points were overall survival (OS), median PFS, objective radiographic response
rate, and safety. Two patient cohorts, distinguished by
tumor histology, were enrolled in parallel. Patients in
cohort A had astrocytoma including the following histologic subtypes: fibrillary, gemistocytic, protoplasmic, and
pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. Patients in cohort B had
oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma. The dose of imatinib differed to account for the effect of CYP3A-inducing
antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) on imatinib metabolism:33,34
patients not on EIAEDs received 400 mg once a day,
whereas those on EIAEDs received 500 mg twice a day. All
patients received 500 mg of hydroxyurea twice a day. Medically appropriate efforts were used to maintain study-specific EIAED exposure for all patients.
Patients were assessed every 8 weeks and remained
on study unless they withdrew consent, developed tumor
progression, or unacceptable toxicity.

Patient Eligibility
Adult patients (18 years of age) were required to have histologically confirmed LGG that was progressive or recurrent based on radiographic or clinical features, the latter
defined as new/worsening neurologic deficits excluding
seizures. Patients with intrinsic optic pathway tumors were
eligible without histologic confirmation as long as 1 of the
following criteria were met: progressive vision loss documented by ophthalmologic examination; worsened proptosis; 2 mm increase in optic nerve diameter; or increased
tumor distribution within the optic tract or optic radiations
on neuroimaging. Measurable disease was required for all
patients. Satisfactory hematologic (hemoglobin 10 g/dL,
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1500 cells/L, platelets
>100,000 cells/L), biochemical (serum creatinine <1.5
mg/dL, blood urea nitorgen (BUN) <25 mg/dL, aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin <1.5  upper limit
of normal) and performance status (Karnofsky [KPS]
60%) parameters were also required. Patients were
required to be at least 2 weeks from before surgery and at
least 4 weeks from before radiation or chemotherapy. All
patients provided informed consent.
Key exclusion criteria included: before imatinib or
PDGFR-directed therapy; before progressive disease or
grade 3 toxicity to hydroxyurea treatment; grade 2 peripheral edema; pulmonary, pericardial, or peritoneal
effusions of any grade; patients with an excessive risk of an
intracranial hemorrhage, or who had evidence of hemorrhage on pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) unless it was stable and grade 1; and concurrent
warfarin administration. There was no limit on the number of prior therapies or episodes of progressive disease.
Assessments
Disease status was assessed after every other cycle using a
modified version of the Macdonald criteria,35 to classify
neurologic, corticosteroid, and radiologic changes. In
addition, the numeric cutoffs defined in the Macdonald
criteria were also applied to the evaluation of the T2 or
fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) changes associated with the tumor to define response.
Safety assessments included weekly complete blood
counts and monthly chemistry profiles. Adverse events
were classified according to the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0.
Treatment Modifications
Initiation of each 28-day treatment cycle required an
ANC 1000/mm3, a platelet count of 100,000/mm3,

serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) 2.5
times the upper institutional norm, and a creatinine 1.5
times the upper institutional norm. Dose modifications
were implemented for unacceptable toxicity defined as
grade 4 neutropenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia, grade
3 nonhematologic toxicity not attributable to underlying disease, concurrent medication or comorbid event, or
any toxicity requiring >2 weeks to resolve to grade 1 or
retreatment criteria. Hydroxyurea was decreased to 500
mg once a day for the first episode of unacceptable hematologic toxicity. Thereafter, additional episodes of unacceptable hematologic toxicity were treated with a decrease
in total daily imatinib dosing of 100 mg/d for patients not
on EIAEDs and 200 mg/day for patients on EIAEDs. For
other unacceptable toxicities, the hydroxyurea dose was
decreased by 250 mg/d and the dose of imatinib was
decreased by 100 mg/d for patients not on EIAEDs and
200 mg/d for patients on EIAEDs.
Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint of the current study was progression-free survival at 12 months (PFS-12) for each cohort.
Secondary endpoints included time to progression, overall
survival (OS), objective response rate as well as safety and
tolerability. Given a 12-PFS rate of 76% (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 63%-92%) for recurrent/progressive LGG
patients treated with the standard 5-day regimen of temozolomide,20 a sample size goal of 32 patients per cohort
was chosen to allow 90% power to differentiate between
12-PFS rates of 65% and 85% with a type I error rate of
0.082.
A ‘‘stopping rule’’ for unacceptable toxicity was
incorporated for each stratum. Specifically, if 6 or more of
the first 16 patients per stratum experienced unacceptable
toxicity as defined above, further accrual would be suspended. In addition, if 9 or more of the total 32 patients
experienced unacceptable toxicity, the treatment regimen
would be considered to have an unacceptable toxicity profile. The type I and II error rates associated with this testing were 0.053 and 0.053, respectively.
PFS and OS were measured from the cycle 1 start
date and summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimator
including 95% CIs.

EIAEDs and approximately 17% of each cohort had
received before radiotherapy. A small subset of each
cohort underwent either stereotactic biopsy or subtotal
resection before enrollment and initiation of study therapy to confirm persistent LGG histology and demonstrate that these patients had not transformed to highgrade histology.
Toxicity
Seven-hundred and fifty-seven cycles of therapy were
administered as of April 1, 2011. The adverse events seen
in the study were as expected for this population and this
class of therapy. They were mostly mild and transient and
gave no indication of target organ toxicity. Table 2 summarizes adverse events felt to be at least possibly attributable to the study regimen. Of note, the frequency and

4762

severity of adverse events did not differ between patient
cohorts or between patients on and not on EIAEDs. Three
patients (4.6%) were taken off study therapy due to toxicity including 2 patients with grade 4 neutropenia and 1
patient with asymptomatic, grade 1 CNS hemorrhage
noted on surveillance MRI. Most adverse events were
grade 2. Among grade 3 events, single patients experienced anemia, fatigue, infection, and weight loss, whereas
diarrhea and thrombocytopenia affected 2 patients each
and 5 patients experienced neutropenia. Grade 4 events
were limited to neutropenia (n ¼ 2) and diarrhea (n ¼ 1),
respectively. There were no grade 5 attributable adverse
events. Dose modification was required in 5 patients
including 2 astrocytoma patients and 3 oligodendroglioma patients; of note, all 5 of these patients were not on
EIAEDs.

Outcome
Table 3 summarizes study outcome. As of April 1, 2011,
median follow-up for all patients was 180 weeks and all
patients have discontinued study therapy except for 1 oligodendroglioma patient who continues on treatment in
cycle 51. Thirty-four patients (53%) elected to discontinue study therapy with stable disease, while 27 patients
(42%) came off study due to progressive disease. Three
patients (5%) were taken off study therapy due to toxicity
(discussed above).
Median PFS and PFS-12 for all patients were 43.5
weeks (95% CI: 33.0, 53.6) and 39.1% (95% CI: 27.2,
50.7). Of note, PFS did not differ between patients with
astrocytoma or those with oligodendroglioma. Median
OS was not reached for either study cohort. Best radiographic response was stable disease and none of the
patients achieved a radiographic response. More than 1
episode of prior progression was associated with poorer
PFS (P ¼ .005), whereas the presense of contrast enhancement had a borderline effect (P ¼ .07). In contrast, PFS
was not related to age <40 years, KPS 90, maximum
tumor unidimensional size >6 cm, crossing the midline,
oligodendroglioma histology, or the concurrent administration of EIAEDs (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Low-grade glioma accounts for approximately 15% of
adult primary central nervous system tumors. Large series
have identified clinical factors associated with poor prognosis including age >40 years, poor performance status,
tumors that are large or unresectable, and nonoligodendroglial histology.7 More recently biologic factors have
been linked with outcome including histology,5 codeletion
of chromosomes 1p19q,36 methylation of methylguanine
methyltransferase,19,21 and IDH1/2 mutation.37-39
Beyond radiotherapy, optimal therapy for patients
with poor prognostic factors or those with recurrent/progressive tumors have not been clearly identified. Several
series have demonstrated that chemotherapy regimens
such as PCV, and more recently including temozolomide,
have activity in this setting.17-21,40-45
The primary rationale for evaluating imatinib in this
study is its inhibitory capacity against PDGFR. Lowgrade gliomas, including both astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas frequently express PDGFR while some of
these tumors also express PDGF, implicating a potential
autocrine and/or paracrine loop of dysregulated signaling.26-28,46 Several important findings also implicate

Forty-six of 58 patients were evaluable for response.

PDGFR signaling in LGG physiology47 including that
exogenous PDGF induces astrocytoma proliferation30
and that PDGFR activation has been linked with transformation of neural stem/progenitor cells into glial
tumors.31,48-51 In addition, PDGF dominant-negative
mutants can revert the transformed phenotype of human
astrocytoma cells.52
Imatinib has not been previously evaluated for
patients with grade II glioma; however, preclinical in vitro
assays have demonstrated activity against astrocytoma
lines.53 In addition, imatinib was anecdotally reported to
elicit marked regression of a recurrent pilocytic astrocytoma (WHO grade I) in a pediatric patient.54
Hydroxyurea, a ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase inhibitor, exerts a cell cycle-specific effect during the
S-phase of mitosis, thereby blocking DNA synthesis.
Although hydroxyurea has is not known to have singleagent activity against malignant gliomas, it has been incorporated into several therapeutic regimens for primary
CNS tumor patients.55-59 Hydroxyurea exhibits rapid
absorption from the gastrointestinal tract after oral dosing
and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. In the current
study regimen for LGG patients, we hypothesized that the
cytotoxicity of protracted hydroxyurea dosing may augment the anti-PDGFR activity of imatinib yielding
enhanced antitumor activity than could be achieved by either agent alone. Of note, modest activity of imatinib plus
hydroxyurea was initially observed among recurrent highgrade glioma patients;33,60,61 however, these results were
not confirmed in subsequent multicenter studies.62,63
Several factors may have contributed to these disappointing results including the relatively low level of PDGFR
activation in primary GBM tumors.
In the current study, imatinib and hydroxyurea was
well tolerated among recurrent LGG patients. The major-

4764

ity of adverse events were grade 2, whereas grade 3 events
were uncommon and grade 4 toxicities were rare. The toxicity profile of this regimen appears comparable to that
reported for various temozolomide regimens among
recurrent/progressive LGG patients.19-21,40,41
However, outcome on the current study appears inferior to that reported for temozolomide. We observed no
radiographic responses, whereas the radiographic response
rate reported among various temozolomide regimens is
20% to 61%.19-21,24,40,41 One potential factor contributing to this difference may be differences in criteria used to
define radiographic response. For example, we required a
partial response to include a 50% reduction of the FLAIR
bidimensional product as well as any enhancing disease,
whereas some of the other studies only assessed enhancing
tumor. The accurate ascertainment of tumor growth control can be challenging to achieve among tumors where
the natural history reflects indolent growth, such as LGG.
In addition, the use of a numeric cutoff to define progression, such as a 25% increase in tumor dimension, can be
misleading in that this practice allows tumors to be classified as stable, when in fact, they are progressively growing.
Recently published recommendations for response assessment among LGG patients provide guidelines that will
help ensure optimal and consistent assessment approaches
for future LGG studies.64
In addition, the median PFS and PFS-12 rate
observed on our study, 11 months and 39%, respectively,
were lower than most of the results reported for temozolomide therapy (Table 4).19-21,24,40,41 We evaluated several
clinical factors previously shown to predict outcome for
LGG patients and most were not associated with PFS,
most likely reflecting the overall negative outcome on our
study. Unfortunately, due to lack of archival tumor material, we were unable to assess whether PDGF/PDGFR

expression or genetic abnormalities such as chromosome
1p/19q or IDH 1/2 mutations correlated with outcome.
Another factor contributing to the low activity observed on
the current study is that the distribution of imatinib into
the brain in preclinical studies has been shown to be limited
by P-glycoprotein mediated efflux.65 Although imatinib
has been shown to achieve intratumoral concentrations
that are comparable to those measured in plasma among
malignant glioma patients where the blood-brain barrier is
relatively defective,66 the blood-brain barrier was likely
intact for most of the patients in the current study given
their low-grade histology.67 Although our study demonstrated that imatinib, combined with hydroxyurea, had
negligible antitumor activity, PDGF and PDGFR remain
noteworthy potential therapeutic targets for recurrent/progressive LGG and studies evaluating other PDGF/PDGFR
inhibitors should be considered.
