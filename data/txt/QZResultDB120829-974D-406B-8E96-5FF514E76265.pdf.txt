dependent manner (9) and can distinguish between normal and
malignant vasculature (10, 11) and lymphatic tissue in murine
systems (9). The latter also induce apoptosis in tumor types, which
also bind the peptide (9). However, even these recent additions to
the CPP armamentarium seem limited to binding to tumorassociated endothelial or lymphatic cells rather than directly and
preferentially penetrating a wide variety of malignant cells. Various
mechanisms for entry have been proposed; it now seems that the
majority of CPPs enter cells via adsorptive-mediated endocytosis
rather than direct penetration of the plasma membrane (1).
Whatever the mechanisms of cell entry and intracellular disposition, the overriding question regarding the potential pharmacologic
application of CPPs is whether or not their intracellular
concentration in a target cell, in addition to that of any attendant
cargo, is sufficient to elicit a pharmacologic response at levels that
are not toxic to nontarget cells (1). We have recently suggested
amino acids (aa) 50 to 77 of azurin, a cupredoxin secreted by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as a putative protein transduction
domain (PTD) responsible for the penetration of azurin into
cancer cells (12), although we did not identify a route of cellular
entry. The present study refines the PTD of azurin from aa 50 to 77
(p28) to aa 50 to 67 (p18) and provides evidence for an endocytotic
and nonendocytotic-mediated entry into normal and cancer cells
that is not dependent on membrane bound glycosaminoglycans.
Moreover, the COOH-terminal 12 aa of p28 accounts for a
significant amount of the antiproliferative activity of azurin on
human cancer cells (13, 14).

Abstract
Azurin, a member of the cupredoxin family of copper
containing redox proteins, preferentially penetrates human
cancer cells and exerts cytostatic and cytotoxic (apoptotic)
effects with no apparent activity on normal cells. Amino acids
50 to 77 (p28) of azurin seem responsible for cellular
penetration and at least part of the antiproliferative,
proapoptotic activity of azurin against a number of solid
tumor cell lines. We show by confocal microscopy and
fluorescence-activated cell sorting that amino acids 50 to 67
(p18) are a minimal motif (protein transduction domain)
responsible for the preferential entry of azurin into human
cancer cells. A combination of inhibitors that interfere with
discrete steps of the endocytotic process and antibodies for
caveolae and Golgi-mediated transport revealed that these
amphipathic, A-helical peptides are unique. Unlike the
cationic cell-penetrating peptides, A-helical antennapedialike, or VP22 type peptides, p18 and p28 are not bound by cell
membrane glycosaminoglycans and preferentially penetrate
cancer cells via endocytotic, caveosome-directed, and caveosome-independent pathways. Once internalized, p28, but not
p18, inhibits cancer cell proliferation initially through a
cytostatic mechanism. These observations suggest the azurin
fragments, p18 and p28, account for the preferential entry of
azurin into human cancer cells and a significant amount of
the antiproliferative activity of azurin on human cancer cells,
respectively. [Cancer Res 2009;69(2):537–46]

Experimental Procedures

Introduction

Cell culture and cell lines. Human cancer and noncancer
(immortalized and nonimmortalized) cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection [lung cancer (A549 and NCI-H23
adenocarcinoma), normal lung (CCD-13Lu), prostate cancers
(DU145 and LN-CAP), normal prostate (CRL11611), breast cancer
(MCF-7), normal breast (MCF-10A), colon cancer (HCT116),
normal colon (CCD33Co), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), and ovarian
cancer (SK-OV3 adenocarcinoma)]. Normal fibroblasts isolated
from skin were established in our laboratory. Normal ovarian cells
(HOSE6-3) were a generous gift from Dr. S.W. Tsao (University of
Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China). Melanoma lines (UISO-Mel-2, 23,
29) were established and characterized in our laboratory (15). All
cells except UISO-Mel-2 (MEM-H) were cultured in MEM-E
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (Atlanta Biological, Inc.), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100
Ag/mL streptomycin at 37jC in 5% CO2 or air.
Proliferation assays/cell growth. Melanoma cells were seeded
(4 replicates) in flat-bottomed 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson) at
a density of 12  103 cells per well. After 24 h, medium was
changed and fresh p18, p28, azurin, or a similar volume of medium

Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) are short amphipathic and
cationic peptides and peptide derivatives, usually containing
multiple lysine and arginine residues (1). They form a class of
small molecules receiving significant attention as potential
transport agents for a variety of cargoes including cytotoxic drugs
(2, 3), antisense oligonucleotides (4), in gene therapy (5, 6), and as
decoy peptides (7). Small arginine-rich and other cationic peptides
generated from phage-displayed peptide libraries, initially characterized by the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence that recognizes the
integrin family of cell surface receptors important to the invasion
of tumor cells (8), are also potential carriers for imaging (9) and
therapeutic agents. These peptides enter cells in an energy-

Cells were then incubated with 1 Ag/mL rabbit anti-human golgin
97 or anti-human caveolin 1 (Abcam) in PBS with 1% bovine serum
albumin. After 1 h of incubation at 4jC, coverslips were washed
once with PBS, incubated 10 min in PBS containing Alexa Fluor
468–conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, washed 2 in PBS, and
once in d.i.H2O. Coverslips were mounted in medium containing
1.5 Ag/mL DAPI. Colocalization (yellow) of Alexa Fluor 568 (red)
and Alexa Fluor 468 (green) was analyzed and photographed.
UISO-Mel-2 cells on coverslips were preincubated in MEM-H
containing 100 Ag/mL heparin sulfate (HS; Sigma-Aldrich) for
30 min and p18, p28, or Arg8 were added to bring the final
concentration to 20 Amol/L. After 1 h, coverslips were washed,
fixed, and analyzed as described.
Cell penetration by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cells
(1.0  106/500 AL PBS) were incubated for 2 h at 37jC with Alexa
Fluor–568 labeled p18 or p28 (20 Amol/L), Arg8 (5 Amol/L), or
medium alone, washed 3 in PBS, fixed in 2.5% formalin for 5 min,
washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 200 AL PBS, passed through a
screen to obtain a single-cell suspension, and analyzed with a
MoFlo Cell Sorter (Dako) Eex 568 nm and Eem 603 nm. The fold
increase of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) over background
levels represents mean fluorescence of three separate experiments.
Entry inhibitors. UISO-Mel-2 cells (3  105 per 300 AL)
maintained in phenol red–free, serum-free MEM-H at 37jC, were
pretreated with the following inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich): chlorpromazine (CPZ), amiloride, nystatin, filipin, methyl-h-cyclodextrin
(MhCD), brefeldin A (BFA), Taxol, sodium azide, cytochalasin D,
staurosporine, ouabain, wortmannin, monensin, nocodazole,
benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-a-D-galactopyranoside, (BnGalNac),
tunicamycin, and neuraminidase. Final concentrations were
derived from the dose response curves of individual inhibitors.
Alexa Fluor 568–labeled p18 or p28 (20 Amol/L) was then added,
incubated for 1 h, and the cells washed, fixed, and prepared for flow
cytometric analysis.
Cell membrane toxicity assays/lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay. A lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage assay was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (CytoToxOne; Promega) with 100 AL of UISO-Mel-2 cells (5  103).
Cells without peptides/proteins were used as a negative control.
Experiments were carried out in triplicate (data represent
mean F SE).
Hemolysis assay. Human whole blood samples (2–3 mL) were
centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000  g, the pellets washed once with
PBS, once with HKR buffer (pH7.4; ref. 18), resuspended in HKR
buffer to 4% erythrocytes, and 50 AL transferred to a 1.5-mL tube
with 950 AL of peptides, azurin (5, 50, and 100 Amol/L) or 0.1%
Triton X-100 in HRK buffer to disrupt the RBC membrane. MAP
and Mastoparan7 (Bachem California, Inc.) were used as positive
controls. After 30 min at 37jC with rotation, tubes were centrifuged
for 2 min at 1,000  g, 300 AL of supernatants transferred to a
96-well plate, and absorbance recorded at 540 nm.
Kinetics of entry. UISO-Mel-2 cells (5  105 cells) were
suspended in MEM-H without phenol red. Reactions were started
by adding either Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated p18 at 0, 10, 20, 50,
100, 150, and 200 Amol/L for 5, 10, 15, and 20 s, or Alexa Fluor
568–conjugated p28 at 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 Amol/L for
30, 60, 90, and 120 s on ice. After incubation, 1 mL of cold-PBS was
added to the 250 AL reaction in mixture. Cells were centrifuged
twice at 600  g for 2 min at 4jC. At least 10,000 fixed cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry in each reaction, and their background
and relative fluorescence were calculated.

without peptide (8 replicates) added daily for 72 h. Cells were then
counted in a Beckman Coulter (Z1 coulter particle counter). Values
represent the mean F SD of four replicates.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Melanoma cells were seeded at a density of 2,000
cells per well and allowed to attach for 24 h. Freshly prepared
peptide (10 AL) or culture medium was then added to each well.
After 24 h, medium was changed and p18, p28, or azurin were
added daily. After 72 h of incubation, 10 AL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent
(Trevigen) was added to each well, the samples incubated for
3 h at room temperature, 100 AL of detergent added to each well,
and incubated for an additional 3 h at 37jC. Absorbance was
measured with a SpectraMax 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices
Corporation) and percent change in the absorbance at 570 nm in
treated cells relative to untreated controls determined. Values
represent the mean F SD. Significance between control and treated
groups was determined by Student’s t test.
Peptide synthesis. All azurin-derived peptides including p18,
Leu 50 -Gly 67 LSTAADMQGVV TDGMASG, p28 Leu 50 -Asp 77
LSTAADMQGVVTDGMASGLDKDYLKPDD, p18b Val 60 -Asp 77
VTDGMASGLDKDYLKPDD, p12 Gly66-Asp77 SGLDKDYLKPDD,
mitogen-activated protein, Mastoparan-7, and poly arginine
(Arg8) were synthesized by CS Bio, Inc., as >95% purity and mass
balance.
Predictive modeling for azurin peptides. We used GENETYX
software (ver. 6.1) to generate Robson structure models for azurin
derived peptides (16). The MAPAS software was used to identify
strong membrane contacts and define regions of the protein
surface that form such contacts (17). If a protein, i.e., azurin, has a
membranephilic residue score (MRS) of >3, membranephilic area
score (MAS) of >60%, and coefficient of membranephilic asymmetry (Kmpha) of >2.5, there is a high probability that the protein has a
true membrane-contacting region.
Peptide/protein labeling. Peptides were dissolved in 1 mL PBS
mixed with Alexa Fluor 568 dye (Molecular Probes) at a 1:2 protein/
dye ratio, 100 AL sodium bicarbonate were added, and the mixture
were incubated overnight at 4jC with continuous stirring. Labeled
peptide was dialyzed against cold-PBS using Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis
Cassettes 1000 MWCO for p12 and 2000 MWCO for others (Pierce
Biotechnology).
Cell penetration/confocal analysis. Cells were seeded overnight on glass coverslips at 37jC under 5% CO2, rinsed with fresh
medium, and incubated at 37jC for 2 h in prewarmed medium
containing Alexa Fluor 568–labeled azurin peptides (20 Amol/L),
Arg8 (5 Amol/L), or medium alone. After incubation, coverslips
were rinsed 3 with PBS, fixed in 2.5% formalin for 5 min, and
washed 2 in PBS, once in d.i.H2O, and mounted in medium
containing 1.5 Ag/mL 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to
counter stain nuclei (VECTASHIELD; Vector Laboratories).
Cellular uptake and distribution were photographed under an
inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Model LC510; Carl
Zeiss Inc.).
Peptide colocalization with lysosomes or mitochondria was
determined by incubating cells growing on a glass coverslip for
2 h at 37jC with Alexa Fluor 568–labeled azurin or peptides.
Mitrotracker (MitroTracker Green FM) or lysotracker (LysoTracker
Green DND-26; Invitrogen Corporation) was added ( final concentration, 1 Amol/L) for the last 30 min of incubation. Cells were
rinsed 3 with PBS, fixed in 2.5% formalin for 5 min, washed
2 with PBS, and incubated in 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS for 15 min.

and p28 into either cancer or normal cells was less than that
observed with Arg8, where no preference for entry was observed
(Fig. 1A). The predicted Robson structure (data not shown) of p18
suggests that the COOH-terminal aas form a partial h-sheet. This
and the shorter length of p18, which lacks the hydrophilic COOHterminal 10 aas (aa 68–77) of p28, suggests that p18, as a putative
PTD for azurin, may have a more rapid entry into cancer and
normal cells via a nonendocytotic over an endocytotic or
membrane receptor mediated process. MAPAS data (MRS, 3.74;
MAS, 87.1; Kmpha, 2.37) predict that aas 69, 70, 75, 76, and 85 of
azurin provide the best opportunity for membrane contact,
suggesting the COOH-terminal region of p28, not present on p18
(aa, 50–67), is most likely to contact specific residues on the cell
membrane, irrespective of the status of a cell.
The preferential penetration of p18 and p28 was confirmed by
exposing the same cell lines to azurin 60 to 77 (p18b), or aa 66 to 77
(p12), the COOH-terminal 12 aa of p28 (Fig. 2A and B). Here, the
preferential penetration observed with p18 and p28 was completely
abolished. p18b (theoretical pI 4.13) has a short a-helix and partial
h-sheet (16), and is extremely hydrophilic, which together may
negate preferential entry. p12 (theoretical pI 4.33) lacks a
secondary a-helical structure but is also hydrophilic, suggesting
overall hydrophilcity may be a major contributor to the decrease in
selectivity of cell penetration.
Cell penetration is not a result of membrane disruption. Cell
penetration by azurin, p28, and p18 does not result from
membrane disruption. An LDH assay (Fig. 3A) suggested that

Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific
binding from total binding and Scatchard plots generated.

Results
The NH2-terminal domain of p28 is responsible for
preferential entry into cancer cells. We initially defined aa
50 to 77 of azurin as a putative PTD for cell penetration (12), which
fits well with structural evidence for an a-helical region
encompassing residues 54 to 67 of azurin stabilizing the azurin
molecule (19). Confocal analyses initially suggested that p28 and
p18 of p28/azurin (Fig. 1A) penetrated human cancer cells with
similar efficiency but did not penetrate histologically matched
normal cell lines to the same degree (Fig. 1A; ref. 12). A singular
exception was CCD13-Lu, a cell line derived from lung fibroblasts.
The cationic Arg8 was rapidly and efficiently taken up into
fibroblasts (Fig. 1A) and all other normal cell lines tested (data not
shown). These observations were confirmed by a more sensitive
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses (Fig. 1B) where
p28 fluorescence was f0.5 to 6 and p18 f0.5- to 3-fold higher
than the corresponding normal cell line, with the exception of lung
cancer. A similar pattern in intracellular fluorescence intensity was
observed within a melanomas, where the relative intensity of p18
was f50% of that observed with p28 (Fig. 1C). Fluorescence
intensity over background was also consistently lower in cell pairs
exposed to p18 than p28 (data not shown), again suggesting less
p18 entered individual cells. In all cases, the degree of entry of p18

azurin and its peptides. A, LDH leakage
assay of UISO-Mel-2 cells exposure for
10 min to different concentrations of p28,
p18, and azurin at 37jC. A standard
lysis buffer (cytotox-one reagent) was
included as a positive control. Changes
in fluorescence after exposure were
measured at Eex 560 nm and Eem 590 nm.
Lysis buffer was defined as 100% LDH

MFI. The K m and V max of each peptide were calculated by plotting
peptide concentration (Amol/L) versus velocity (MFI/seconds) or
by Scatchard analysis. Although the penetration of azurin fragments 50 to 67 (p18: V max, 2.46; K m, 101.6) and 50 to 77 (p28: V max,
1.87; K m, 159.1) into cancer and normal cells (V max, 2.88; K m, 102.1;
and V max, 1.89; K m, 166.0, respectively) differs from each other, with
p18 entering f42% faster, the rate of the entry of each peptide into
normal and cancer cells is virtually identical. The increase in
amount of fluorescence after exposure of cancer cells to p28
relative to p18 is likely due to the increase in the amount of p28
entering malignant cells. 125I azurin and p18 bound to UISO-Mel-2
cells with a similar affinity. In contrast, more p28 [Kd, 2.5 Am;
maximum number of binding sites (Bmax), 3.0 pm] bound to UISOMel-2 cells with a higher affinity when exposed for a longer period
of time (20 versus 2 min) at a higher temperature (37jC versus 4jC)
than either p18 (Kd, 18 nm; Bmax, 0.51 pm) or azurin (Kd, 10 nm and
0.48 pm). These results suggest that azurin, p28, and p18 all bind
with relatively high affinity and capacity to a site on the cancer and
normal cell surface before entry, but may enter via more than one
mechanism.
p18/p28 penetration involves Caveolae and the Golgi
Complex. As a class, cationic CPPs such as pTat and Arg8 enter
cells by initially binding to anionic, sulfated proteoglycans before

neither peptide nor azurin entered cells by altering plasma
membrane integrity (18). The lack of membrane disruption was
confirmed by determining the hemolytic activity of azurin, p28, and
p18 on human erythrocytes against the receptor mimetic MAP and
mastoparan 7, which translocates cell membranes as an amphipathic a-helix, and activates heterotrimeric G proteins (18).
Mastoparan 7 caused complete cell lysis at 25 Amol/L, whereas
azurin, p28, and p18 had no effect when compared with control
(Fig. 3B).
p18/p28 penetration is energy dependent and saturable. The
penetration of p28 (Fig. 4A) and p18 (Fig. 4B) into UISO-Mel-2 cells
is temperature dependent. Cell penetration and intracellular
transport occurs relatively slowly over 3 hours at 4jC, whereas
entry and intracellular transport through various compartments is
rapid at 22 and 37jC as p18 and p28 were present in the nucleus of
UISO-Mel-2 cells within 2 hours postexposure. The penetration of
5 Amol/L p28 (Fig. 4C) or p18 (Fig. 4D) into UISO-Mel-2 cells after 30
minutes in the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled peptide
was severely curtailed, suggesting that entry was a saturable process
and specific receptors or cell surface proteins or specific residues
were, at least in part, responsible for initial entry.
Kinetics of p28 and p18. The kinetics of p28 and p18 entry into
UISO-Mel-2 cells relative to human fibroblasts was calculated using

Figure 4. Temperature-dependent and competitive internalization of p28 and p18 into UISO-Mel-2 cells. Penetration of Alexa Fluor 568–labeled p28 (A) or

trafficking of p18 and p28 also suggests that clathrin-mediated
endocytosis is not involved in internalization of these peptides
(22, 23).
Monensin, which inhibits late endosome/lysosome, and BFA, a
disruptor of the Golgi apparatus, reduced the intracellular
accumulation of both peptides with a greater inhibitory effect on
p28 (f30%) than p18 (f10%; Fig. 5B).
The penetration of p28 and p18 into fibroblasts was also
inhibited by MhCD, nocodazole, monensin, and tunicamycin, but
not by amiloride, sodium azide, and CPZ (Fig. 5C). This suggests
that at least one mechanism of entry into cancer and normal cells
may be similar, but additional preferential accumulation into
cancer cells may be a function of the number of common
membrane receptors or structures, i.e., caveolae (Fig. 5B, 1 and 2).
p18 and p28 colocalized with caveolin-1 and golgin 97 antibodies
(Fig. 5D, 1 and 2), confirming these organelles are involved in the
intracellular trafficking of p18 and p28. Interestingly, azurin, but
neither p18 nor p28, colocalized with mitochondrial specific
fluorescence (Fig. 5D, 3). In contrast, p28 and azurin, but not
p18, colocalized with lysosomes, (Fig. 5D, 4).
Functional analysis of p28 and p18. Azurin inhibits the growth
of several human cancer cell lines in vitro (14, 24–26) and in vivo
(13). Figure 6A and B illustrate the effect of p18 and p28 relative to
azurin and dacarbazine (DTIC) on UISO-Mel-2 cells as determined
by MTT and cell count. Azurin decreased (P < 0.05) cell survival
at 100 and 200 Amol/L f15% (Fig. 6A). p28 inhibited cell survival
14% and 22% (P < 0.05) at 100 and 200 Amol/L, respectively. In
contrast, p18 had no effect, whereas DTIC produced a significant
dose-related decrease on UISO-Mel-2 survival. Azurin and p28
(200 Amol/L) also significantly decreased the survival of UISO-Mel23 and 29 cells, whereas p18 had no significant effect. In contrast,
azurin and p28 produced a dose-related decrease in cell number
(Fig. 6B). p18 had no effect on UISO-Mel-2 cell proliferation. The
apparent increase (f30–35%; UISO-Mel-2) in p28 and azurin
inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation, measured directly,
suggests that the inhibitory effect may reside primarily at the level
of cell cycle with apoptosis subsequent to any delay. Although p18

the entry of either p28 or p18 (Fig. 5A). The penetration of p18,
and p28 (Fig. 5B) into UISO-Mel-2 cells in the presence or absence
of a specific inhibitor of O-linked glycosylation, BnGalNac, and
neuraminidase, which cleaves sialic acid residues, was also
inhibited. However, tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, significantly reduced the penetration of p18 and p28 across
the cell membrane (P < 0.05).
Inhibitors of energy-dependent transport mechanisms, i.e., ATP.
Sodium azide (Fig. 5B) and ouabain (Na+K+ ATPase pump) did not
inhibit the penetration of either peptide, suggesting nonendocytotic pathways might also be involved in the penetration of these
peptides. CPZ, which inhibits clathrin mediated endocytosis, also
had no effect on penetration, nor did the macropinocytosis
inhibitor amiloride (Fig. 5B). Stabilization of microtubules with
Taxol had no effect on penetration, but disruption of actin
filaments and macropinocytosis with Cytochalasin D produced a
small (f20%), reproducible inhibition of p18 and p28 penetration.
The lack of effect of amiloride suggests that the inhibitory activity
of Cytochalasin D is probably through its effect on actin filaments.
Inhibition of the cell cycle with staurosporine did not block
penetration, suggesting that penetration was not cell cycle specific.
The lack of effect of staurosporine on p18 and p28 penetration of
the cancer cell plasma membrane also suggests that a Src kinase/
tyrosine kinase–dependent pathway was not involved in penetration (20), was dynamin independent, and hence independent of
caveolae budding (21). In contrast, nocodazole, which disrupts
caveolae transport and inhibitors of cholesterol mobilization and,
hence, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, inhibited penetration 50%
to 65%.
Wortmannin, an inhibitor of early endosome formation, did not
block the intracellular accumulation of either p18 or p28 suggesting
that, unlike cholera toxin (22), a caveolae to early endosome
pathway is not involved in the intracellular trafficking of p18 and
p28. The lack of early endosome involvement in the intracellular

Cellular Entry of Azurin-Derived Peptides

Amphipathic CPPs cytolytic to cancer cells either disrupt the
cancer cell membrane, alter mitochondrial permeability, or act
through a specific receptor mediated mechanism (29). Synthetic
magainins, a helical, channel-forming, or ionophore class of
peptides including those exclusively composed of Lys, Ala, and
Leu residues (30) rapidly and irreversibly lyse hematopoietic and
solid tumor target cells at doses below those cytotoxic to normal
cells (31, 32) but do not preferentially penetrate cancer cells.
Peptides generated through phage-display technology also do
not induce cytotoxicity by direct penetration of cancer cells (8, 33).
In contrast, azurin and the two peptides derived from it (p28 and
p18) possess the unique property of preferentially entering cancer
cells and inhibiting their proliferation through cytostatic and
cytotoxic mechanisms.
Redox proteins are not normally classified as CPPs, or
antiproliferative agents. The amphipathic, azurin fragments p18

preferentially penetrated cancer cells, unlike p28, it did not inhibit
cell proliferation, suggesting that the cytostatic and cytotoxic
activity of p28 lies in the COOH-terminal 10 to 12 aa of the sequence.

Discussion
PTDs cluster into two groups based on their structural
characteristics, cationic residues, or amphipathic a-helix, although
several decrease into both classes. In general, cationic peptides
initially interact with the cell membranes of prokaryotic and
eukaryotic species (27) by binding to negatively charged surface
glycoproteins, facilitating efficient entry into a broad range of
normal and malignant cell lines (28). The binding of cationic
peptides to HS is consistent with their high affinity for HS
(Kd, f109 nmol/L; ref. 22).
The cytotoxic effect exerted by cationic, amphipathic a-helical
diastereomeric peptides is not generally specific to cancer cells.

mitotracker/lysotracker probes were added and cells incubated for 30 min. Cells were counterstained with DAPI (blue ). Colocalization of azurin, p28, or p18 seems
as a yellow fluorescence.

and p28 contain the 54 to 67 aa a-helical structure of azurin as well
as a partial h-sheet structure (16) and describe a minimal sequence
for cancer cell entry and cell cycle inhibitory activity, respectively.
The entry of azurin, p28, and p18 is distinct from that of cationic
CPPs because sulfated proteoglycans are not involved in the
penetration of either p28 or p18 into cancer cells. Mucin-type Oglycosylation, reportedly associated with somatic cell differentiation and altered expression on some cancer cells, is also not
involved in the entry of p18 and p28 (34). However, this was not
true for N-glycoslyated proteins. Aberrant N-glycosylation on
several cell surface receptors, including integrins and cadherins,
is associated with changes in progression and metastasis of cancers
of diverse histogenesis (35, 36), suggesting a role for as yet
unknown N-glycoslyated cell surface protein(s) in the initial steps
of azurin, p18, and p28 penetration.
The temperature-dependent entry of azurin and aa fragment
50 to 77 (p28; ref. 12) extends to aa 50 to 67 of azurin (p18), whose
entry into normal and malignant cells seems accelerated relative
to p28. The lower K m and higher V max of p18 suggest that aa 50 to
67 define an amphipathic structure when associated with
phospholipid membranes that more closely represents the actual
PTD of azurin. However, an energy-dependent endocytotic or porerelated process does not seem to be the only entry mechanism
available to these peptides. Sodium azide and ouabain (Na+K+
ATPase inhibitor), which inhibit the entry of cationic peptides (37),
did not impair the entry of either p18 or p28 into UISO-Mel-2 cells
or fibroblasts (Fig. 5B and C), suggesting that either peptide may
also penetrate the cell membrane directly. However, the nonendocytotic mechanism described for penetratin and related
peptides requires a peptide more basically charged than either
p18 or p28.
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which underlies cellular penetration of a wide variety of cationic peptides (38, 39), was also not
a route of p18 and p28 entry as CPZ had no effect on cancer cell
membrane penetration (Fig. 5B and C). Azurin-derived peptides
also distance themselves from the proposed routes of cellular
penetration of virtually all other cationic CPPs, i.e., macropinocytosis, distribution to late endosomes or lysosomes along

actin filaments or microtubules, and penetration at specific cell
cycle stages, as inhibitors of each of these routes were singularly
ineffective (Fig. 5B and C). p18, p28, and perhaps azurin seem to
penetrate the plasma membrane and reach late endosmes,
lysosomes, and the golgi associated with caveolae in what has
been described as a dynamin-independent clathrin-independent
carrier-mediated manner (21). The striking inhibition of penetration by nocodazole and relative lack of inhibition by cytochalasin-D, which disrupts actin filaments, supports the idea of
caveolae-mediated entry, but the lack of effect of staurosporine
again suggests that dynamin does not play a large role in the
penetration of either peptide (21). This route of entry has been
described for integral cell surface components and a broad range
of pathogens or their products that also use caveolae to bypass
classic endocytic pathways. Depletion of cholesterol from the
plamsa membrane with h-methylcylodextran, filipin, or nystatin
to disrupt lipid rafts, plasma membrane domains that provide
fluid platforms to segregate membrane components and compartmentalize membranes (1), significantly inhibited the penetration of p18 (50%) and p28 (f60%) into UISO-Mel-2 cells and
fibroblasts (35% and 42%, respectively), suggesting a significant
percentage (f60%) of p18 and p28 penetrates the plasma
membrane via caveolae. Caveolae are a 50- to 100-nm N-shaped
subset of lipid raft invaginations of the plasma membrane defined by
the presence of caveolin-specific proteins (caveolin-1, caveolin-2, or
caveolin-3; ref. 40) that function as regulators of signal transduction.
Because BFA disrupts the Golgi apparatus and inhibited p18
accumulation, we speculate that this pathway is also used in p18
and p28 cell entry and intracellular transport. Cell penetration of
p18 and p28 via caveolae also fits well with our observation that
inhibitors of N-glycosylation reduce cell entry by f60% in UISOMel-2 cells and 25% and 35%, respectively, in fibroblasts. The
percentile differences between p18 and p28 entry may relate to the
numbers of N-glycosylation membrane structures in cancer versus
normal cells and the relative route of entry of p28 and p28 via this
mechanism (Fig. 5B and C). Azurin, p28, and p18 all bind to cancer
cells with high affinity and high capacity relative to other potential
anticancer peptides (41), suggesting this protein/receptor complex

preference for cancer cells, and that the COOH-terminal 10 to 12
aas of p28, aa 50 to 77 of azurin, contain the domain responsible for
cell cycle inhibition and apoptotic activity. As such, these novel
peptides could potentially serve as either a novel chemotherapeutic
agent, adjunct to extant drugs or as CPPs to transport cargos

localizes in caveolae and is internalized, eventually moving
(via caveosomes) to the golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus.
Macropinocytosis does not seem to be involved nor does any entry
mechanism that includes peptide transport to early endosomes. In
addition to caveolar-mediated entry, our kinetic analysis also
suggests that p28 and p18 penetrate the plasma membrane via a
nonclathrin-caveolae–mediated process. A clathrin- and caveolinindependent pathway can exist as a constitutive internalization
mechanism, such as for the interleukin 2 receptor (42) and
for certain glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol–anchored proteins (43).
Clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis is also used by
pathogens to invade cells, either exclusively, as for the murine
polyoma virus (44), or in combination with a conventional pathway,
as is the case for the influenza virus (45). An increase in caveolin-1
expression in cancer cells over normal cells is not likely to be the
sole basis for the preferential entry of azurin, p28, and p18 into
cancer cells. Fibroblasts and a number of other normal cells also
have significant numbers of caveolae on their surface (23).
However, it provides an avenue for additional investigation into
the preferential penetration of these peptides into cancer cells.
Our results suggest that the cellular penetration of aa 50 to 67
and 50 to 77 of azurin is unique relative to all current CPPs in its
