ABSTRACT
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is currently the first-line treatment
for gastric cancer. In this study, using gene expression profiles for a panel of cell
lines with drug sensitivity data and two cohorts of patients, we extracted a signature
consisting of two gene pairs (KCNE2 and API5, KCNE2 and PRPF3) whose withinsample relative expression orderings (REOs) could robustly predict prognoses of
gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy. This REOs-based
signature was insensitive to experimental batch effects and could be directly applied
to samples measured by different laboratories. Taking this unique advantage of the
REOs-based signature, we classified gastric cancer samples of The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) into two prognostic groups with distinct transcriptional characteristics,
circumventing the usage of confounded TCGA survival data. We further showed that
the two prognostic groups displayed distinct copy number, gene mutation and DNA
methylation landscapes using the TCGA multi-omics data. The results provided hints
for understanding molecular mechanisms determining prognoses of gastric cancer
patients treated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

signatures for chemo-treated gastric cancer patients,
usually based on risk scores summarized from the
expression measurements of signature genes [10, 11].
However, this type of signatures cannot be applied
directly to independent inter-laboratory data because
their applications require pre-setting risk thresholds
which are sensitive to experimental batch effects [12].
Although many batch effect correction algorithms and
data normalization methods have been proposed, they
can hardly correct such biases and even distort the real
biological signals [13]. Even if it would be possible to
pre-collect a set of samples to measure together with a
particular sample for data normalization, the risk-score
based signatures would still have a critical limitation that
the risk classification of a sample will change with the

Gastric cancer is often diagnosed in advanced
stage [1], and 5-FU-based chemotherapy is currently
recommended as the first-line treatment [2]. As the
overall response rate is only about 20-40% [3], it is
urgent to develop a signature to recognize patients who
cannot benefit from 5-FU-based chemotherapy and
recommend them to other chemotherapy regimens. A
number of previous studies focused on genes related
to 5-FU metabolism (TS, TP, DPD), DNA repair
(ERCC1, ERBB2) or apoptosis (BCL2, BAX) to find
signatures of 5-FU resistance [4–8] but few have
been validated [9]. Then, many studies have turned
to use gene expression profiles to identify prognostic

uncertain risk compositions of the other samples adopted
for normalization together, as systematically revealed in
our recent work [14]. In contrast, it has been reported that
the within-sample relative expression orderings (REOs)
of genes are insensitive to experimental batch effects
and invariant to monotonic data normalization [15]. With
this unique advantage, the REOs-based signatures can
perform robustly across datasets produced by different
laboratories and allow application at the individual levels
[16]. Therefore, it is worthy adopting the REOs-based
approach to extract robust prognostic signatures for
clinical application.
Notably, researchers often firstly identify prognostic
signatures of overall survival (OS) or relapse risk for
chemo-treated patients, and then prove the drug benefit
predictive value by showing that these signatures could not
predict prognoses of patients not receiving chemotherapy
[11, 17, 18]. However, this approach is challenged by
the argument that patients receiving and not receiving
the chemotherapy may have systemic differences in
malignant degree of tumor or corporeity [19]. To increase
the relevance of prognostic signatures to drug-resistance,
Kim et al. [17] pre-selected “drug-resistance” genes
from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
non-responders and responders of patients with the
chemotherapy treatment. However, because the tissue
samples of non-responders were dissected from patients
after the chemotherapy treatment, these DEGs may mainly
reflect tissue’s response to drug stimuli rather than drug
resistance [20]. The same problem exists when preselecting DEGs between drug-induced resistant cell lines
and parental cell lines [21, 22].
Another major problem in studies for extracting
drug resistance signatures for a single drug on clinical
trials is that currently combination administration of
drugs is conventionally used for cancer chemotherapy
[23]. In such a situation, human cancer-derived cell line
models provide the only chance to identify drug resistance
signature for a single drug [24–26] although the clinical
relevance of cancer cell line models remains controversial
[27]. Recently, we have proved that if two chemoregimens shared one or several drugs, then the overlaps
between their clinically relevant drug resistance genes
(CRGs), defined as the genes differentially expressed
in the non-responders compared with responders
respectively for the two chemo-regimens, should be
(or largely be) the CRGs for the shared single or multiple
drugs, given that the drugs used in combination have no (or
limited) antagonistic effects [28]. Thus, if we could firstly
identify a set of genes positively or negatively associated
with 5-FU GI50 (50% Growth Inhibition) from gastric
cancer cell lines and prove that they are correspondingly
negatively or positively associated with prognoses of
patients treated with a chemo-regimen including 5-FU
as a component, then these genes should be CRGs
for 5-FU shared by the cancer cell models and clinical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemo-regimen, given that patients with poor or good
prognoses should largely represent non-responders
or responders to 5-FU treatment. In this process, the
clinical relevance of the cancer cell line models could be
evaluated by statistical evidence of concordance analysis
(see Materials and Methods) that the genes positively
or negatively correlated with 5-FU GI50 values of the
cell lines were non-randomly negatively or positively
correlated with prognoses of patients treated with
5-FU-based chemotherapy.
In this study, by pre-selecting genes correlated with
both 5-FU GI50 of gastric cancer cells and OS of patients
treated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy, we extracted and
validated a prognostic signature consisting of two gene
pairs. The within-sample REOs of these gene pairs could
robustly stratify patients into distinct prognostic groups.
Using the robust REOs-based signature, we classified
the gastric cancer samples of The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) [29] into two groups. Then, instead of analyzing
the TCGA samples’ survival data which were confounded
with complex chemotherapy regimens and treatment cycles
[30], we confirmed that the two identified groups of TCGA
samples represented the prognostic groups by evidence that
they had the same distinct transcriptional characteristics
with the prognostics groups identified in the validation
dataset. This strategy enabled us to exploit the TCGA multiomics data to reveal the distinct copy number, gene mutation
and DNA methylation landscapes of the prognostic groups.

RESULTS
Extraction of the REOs-based 5-FU-relevant
prognostic signature
We hypothesized that genes which are differentially
expressed between 5-FU-resistant and -sensitive cell lines
while also showing concordant correlation with prognosis
in patients could robustly predict prognoses of gastric
cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy
(Figure 1). Tan et al. [31] classified 28 gastric cancer cell
lines into two subtypes which had significantly different
average 5-FU GI50 values [32], and we defined them as
5-FU-resistant subtype and 5-FU-sensitive subtype,
respectively. Based on the gene expression profiles of
these cell lines (GSE22183, Table 1), 2,175 DEGs were
detected (Student’s t-test, FDR < 20%) between the two
subtypes. Notably, 5 of the 17 cells in the 5-FU-resistant
subtype had GI50 values below the median of the GI50
values of the 28 cells while 2 of the 11 cells in the 5-FUsensitive subtype had GI50 values above the median.
When reclassifying these 5 and 2 cell lines into the
5-FU-sensitive and FU-resistant groups, respectively, no
DEGs could be detected between the two groups with the
same 20% FDR control. Thus, we chose to use the DEGs
between the primary subtypes defined by Tan et al. [31] for
the 28 cell lines as candidates of 5-FU resistance relevant

genes. Statistically, these DEGs should include the genes
associated with 5-FU resistance given that most of 5-FUresistant and 5-FU-sensitive cells were correctly identified.
Then, to ensure the relevance of the candidate genes to

5-FU resistance, we further extracted genes correlated
with 5-FU GI50 values of the cells from these DEGs. In this
regard, from the 2,175 DEGs between the two subtypes,
we were able to extract 100 genes whose expression levels

were significantly correlated with 5-FU GI50 values of the
28 cell lines with a reasonable statistical control (FDR
< 20%, Pearson correlation analysis). Notably, without
the process of preselecting candidates of 5-FU resistance
genes, no genes could be found to be significantly
correlated with 5-FU GI50 values of the 28 cell lines at an
acceptable FDR control level (e.g., FDR < 20%) due to
the conservativeness of multiple testing correction. Then,
based on the gene expression profiles of 35 gastric cancer
patients treated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy extracted
from the GSE15459 dataset (Table 1) [31], denoted as
GC35, we found 14 of the 100 GI50-related genes tended
to be significantly associated with patients’ OS (univariate
Cox model, P < 0.05). The concordance score of the
clinical relevance of these 14 genes was 100%, which was
unlikely to be observed by chance (binomial distribution
test, P < 6.10E–05; see Materials and Methods). In the
following analyses, we focused on analyzing nine of the
14 genes, which were also measured in the validation
GSE14208 dataset produced by the Affymetrix U133A
2.0 platform (Table 1).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

For every two of the nine candidate genes, according
to their within-sample REO, we classified the 35 gastric
cancer samples of the GC35 dataset into two groups and
then evaluated whether they had significantly different OS
(see Materials and Methods). Using univariate Cox model,
we found two gene pairs (KCNE2 and PRPF3, KCNE2
and API5) whose REOs were likely to be associated with
patients’ OS (P < 0.05). KCNE2 had lower expression
level than both PRPF3 and API5 in the high-risk group,
whereas the REOs were reversed in the low-risk group.
Thus, a simple rule was used to classify patients: a patient
would be predicted to be of high risk if and only if KCNE2
had lower expression level than both PRPF3 and API5.
According to this rule, 24 and 11 of the 35 samples were
classified into the high- and low-risk groups, respectively,
and the former had significantly shorter OS than the latter
(HR = 2.78, 95%CI 1.05−7.39, log-rank P = 3.39E-02,
Figure 2A). A multivariate Cox analysis showed that the
signature still tended to be prognostic after adjusting for
stage, grade and gender even though the size of the GC35
dataset was small (P = 0.11, Table 2). As the 35 patients

Validation of the REOs-based 5-FU-relevant

were treated with 5-FU combined with other drugs after
surgery, we hypothesized that the high-risk patients could
benefit from neither 5-FU nor the other drugs used in
combination, whereas the majority of low-risk patients
could benefit from 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Thus, we
defined these two gene pairs as 5-FU-relevant prognostic
signature.
It has been reported that overexpression of KCNE2,
which encodes a member of potassium channel on plasma
membrane, can facilitate cell apoptosis by mediating K+
efflux [33]. Overexpression of API5, which encodes an
apoptosis inhibitory protein, is related to poor prognosis
in various cancers [34]. PRPF3 encodes a constitutive
protein associated with U4 and U6 small nuclear
ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) which make up spliceosome,
and abnormal splicing activity is associated with 5-FU
efficacy [35].
With the same approach, we have also analyzed
the clinical relevance of cisplatin IC50 (50% Inhibitory
Concentration)-related genes based on data of gastric
cancer cell lines but failed to find their correlations with
prognosis (see Supplementary Results). This result seems
to be consistent with previous reports that no significantly
different OS was observed between the 5-FU and cisplatin
combination chemotherapy arm and 5-FU alone arm
[36, 37]. Therefore, cisplatin therapeutic significance for
gastric cancer should be further investigated.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We validated the signature in the GSE14208 dataset
(Table 1), denoted as GC123, which included data for 118
gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU in combination
with cisplatin and five patients treated with capecitabine
in combination with cisplatin, respectively [17]. As
capecitabine is a fluorouracil pro-drug, we collectively
regarded the chemo-regimens of the GC123 dataset as
5-FU-based chemotherapy. The signature predicted 88
and 35 of the 123 patients into high- and low-risk groups,
respectively. Compared with the low-risk group, the
high-risk group had significantly shorter OS (HR = 1.87,
95%CI 1.22-2.88, log-rank P = 3.90E–03, Figure 2B) and
time to progression (TTP) (HR = 2.10, 95%CI 1.35−3.26,
log-rank P = 8.37E–04, Figure 2C). The GC123 dataset
lacked the necessary clinical data for multivariate Cox
analysis. Alternatively, we proved that the transcriptome
difference between the prognostic groups for the stage IV
samples identified in this dataset was consistent with the
corresponding difference for the 24 stage I–III samples
involved in the GC35 dataset. Using Student’s t-test,
with FDR < 20%, we extracted 3,927 DEGs between the
high- and low-risk groups of stage IV samples from the
GC123 dataset. Among these 3,927 DEGs, 456 genes
were found to be deregulated between the 15 high-risk
8747

samples and 9 low-risk samples identified from the 24
stage I–III samples in the GC35 dataset (Student’s t-test,
P < 0.05). The concordance score of the 456 overlapped
DEGs was 98.25%, which was unlikely to happen by
chance (binomial distribution test, P < 1.11E–16; see
Materials and Methods). This result provided evidence
that the signature was independent of the disease stage.
Functional enrichment analyses (hypergeometric
distribution model, FDR < 10%) revealed that the upregulated genes in the high-risk group compared with
the low-risk group identified from the GC123 dataset
were significantly enriched in spliceosome, cell cycle,
DNA replication, DNA repair (including mismatch
repair, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair
and Homologous recombination) and ECM-receptor

interaction, whereas the down-regulated genes were
significantly enriched in immune, cell adhesion molecules
and drug metabolism related pathways (Supplementary
Table S1). The pathways enriched with DEGs between the
two groups from the GC35 dataset were all reproducible
in GC123 (Supplementary Table S2).
Finally, we applied the signature to predict the
survival of the 130 samples of gastric cancer patients
treated with surgery alone, which were extracted from the
GSE15459 dataset and found that it could not stratify the
patients into two groups with significantly different OS
(HR = 1.21, 95%CI 0.69−2.13, log-rank P = 0.50, Figure 2D).
This reflected that the signature was not just prognostic for
gastric cancer patients in general but predictive for patient’s
benefit from 5-FU-based chemotherapy.

Distinct genomic characteristics of prognostic
groups

overexpression in the high-risk samples (Spearman
rank correlation, FDR < 20%). Functional enrichment
analysis (FDR < 10%) showed that these 85 genes were
significantly enriched in the “mismatch repair pathway”,
indicating that the potentially enhanced ability of
mismatch repair could lead to failure of 5-FU-induced
DNA damage in the high-risk patients [38]. In the PPI
network (see Materials and Methods), 12.94% (11) of
the 85 genes with frequent amplification in the high-risk
patients had direct PPI links with at least one of the 92
5-FU metabolism-related genes collected by Tan et al. [39],
which was significantly higher than the corresponding
frequency of 4.05% for the rest 518 genes located in all
the amplified regions in the gastric cancer tissues (Fisher’s
exact test, P = 2.41E–03). As shown in Figure 4A,
the 11 genes frequently amplified in high-risk patients
directly interacted with nine 5-FU metabolism-related
genes including ATR and CHEK1 [40] involved in cell
cycle regulation, MLH1, PMS2 and EXO1 [38] involved
in DNA repair, and BCL2 [41] involved in apoptosis
(Supplementary Table S3). This result suggested that the
high-risk patients had higher malignant degree of tumors.
Comparison of somatic mutation profiles of highand low-risk samples characterized 156 genes whose
mutation frequencies tended to be different between the
two prognostic groups (Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.05).
Among them, LRP1B was mutated in 31.33% of samples
in the high-risk group while its mutation frequency was
15% in the low-risk group. It has been reported that
chromosomal, epigenetic and microRNA-mediated
inactivation of LRP1B increases the growth and invasive
capacity of tumor cells [42]. In addition to LRP1B, all
other 155 genes had higher mutation frequencies in the

Applying the prognostic signature to the gene
expression profiles of 329 gastric cancer samples
documented in TCGA (Table 1), we recognized 286 highrisk patients and 43 low-risk patients. Between the two
prognostic groups for patients in stage I, II, III and IV,
respectively, we detected 1,323, 3,103, 2,823 and 761
DEGs (Rank Products, FDR < 20%). The four lists of DEGs
shared 269, 706, 736 and 182 genes with the 3,927
DEGs from the GC123 dataset for stage IV patients, and
the concordance scores were 90.17%, 83.85%, 95.11%
and 89.01% (binomial distribution test, all values of
P < 1.11E-16), respectively. This result provided further
evidence that the signature was independent of the disease
stage. Among the 329 TCGA tumors, 327 (284 high-risk
and 43 low-risk samples) had copy number alteration data;
289 (249 high-risk and 40 low-risk samples) had somatic
mutation data; and 293 (252 high-risk and 41 low-risk
samples) had DNA methylation data (as described in
Table 1). This allowed us to further characterize the two
prognostic groups in genome and epigenome.
Interestingly, we observed that the high-risk patients
had a distinct copy number amplification landscape
comparing to the low-risk patients, with significantly
higher frequencies (Fisher’s exact test, FDR < 20%) of
copy number gain at 7p22.1, 7p11.2, 7q21.2, 7q22.1,
13q22.1, 13q12.3 and 12p12.1 (Figure 3), whereas
the two prognostic groups had no difference in copy
number loss regions. In further integrated analysis with
the gene expression data, we found that 85 genes located
in the seven amplified regions displayed significant

low-risk group compared with the high-risk group,
significantly more than what expected by chance
(P < 1.11E–16). Functional enrichment analysis
(P < 0.05) showed that these 155 mutation genes
tended to be enriched in Wnt signaling, Ras signaling
and Regulation of autophagy pathways, which implied
that mutation-induced disturbances of these pathways
might promote 5-FU efficacy for the low-risk patients
[43–45]. In the PPI network, 5.13% (eight) of the 155
genes frequently mutated in the low-risk group had direct
PPI links with at least one of the 92 5-FU metabolismrelated genes, which was significantly higher than the
corresponding frequency of 0.93% for the rest 18,759
mutated genes without significantly different mutation
frequencies between the two prognostic groups (Fisher's
exact test, P = 1.36E–04). As shown in Figure 4B,
the eight mutation genes directly interacted with 13
5-FU metabolism-related genes including RRM1
involved in pyrimidine metabolism [46], ATM [40],
MHL1 and BCL2 involved in DNA repair, cell cycle
regulation and apoptosis (Supplementary Table S4).
Therefore, it is possible that these mutation-induced
disturbances could facilitate 5-FU efficacy for the lowrisk patients.

Using the high- and low-risk TCGA samples
with DNA methylation profiles, we identified 1,480
hypermethylated genes and 1,235 hypomethylated
genes in the high-risk group compared with the lowrisk group (Rank Products, FDR < 20%), respectively.
Among the 1,480 hypermethylated genes, 400 genes
were also identified as DEGs between the high-risk
group and the low-risk group, and the concordance
score of hypermethylation with down-regulation was
81.75%, which was highly unlikely to occur by chance
(binomial distribution test, P < 1.11E–16; see Materials
and Methods). This result suggested that the downregulation of the concordant genes could be mediated by
DNA hypermethylation. These genes were significantly
enriched in the “cell adhesion molecules pathway”
(FDR < 10%), indicating that hypermethylationinduced suppression of this pathway might contribute to
5-FU-based chemotherapy resistance. Among the 327
hypermethylation-mediated down-regulated genes in the
high-risk group, 5.81% (19) had direct PPI links with
at least one of the 92 5-FU metabolism-related genes,
which was significantly higher than the corresponding

frequency of 1.53% for the rest 12,476 genes without
concordant hypermethylation with down-regulation in
the high-risk group (Fisher’s exact test, P = 1.83E–06).
As shown in Figure 4C, the 19 hypermethylationmediated down-regulated genes directly interacted with
40 5-FU metabolism-related genes including NME1
[47] and TK1/2 [48] involved in pyrimidine metabolism,
MTR and SHMT1/2 [49] involved in folate metabolism
(Supplementary Table S5). Folate, as a co-factor, can
assist the 5-FU active metabolite flurodeoxyuridine
monophosphate (FdUMP) to inhibit thymidylate synthase
(TS) from DNA synthesis and repair [48]. The results
implied that the hypermethylation-mediated downregulation of genes in the high-risk patients might disturb
the conversion of 5-FU to active metabolites and inhibit
5-FU-induced DNA or RNA damage.
On the other hand, the concordance score of
hypomethylation with up-regulation was only 39.63%,
providing no evidence of hypomethylation- mediated upregulation of genes.

drug efficacy [50]. Despite this problem, such a prognostic
signature can still provide valuable information for clinical
recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy. Because all
the high-risk patients should have high malignant degree
of tumors and the routine clinical chemotherapy might be
unable to improve their clinical outcomes, other therapy
regimens or a larger dosage of chemotherapy could be
recommended to these patients [51]. In contrast, the lowrisk patients identified by the signature should include
both patients with high malignant degree of tumors who,
however, can benefit from chemotherapy and patients with
low malignant degree of tumors who could be at low risk
without the help of chemotherapy. We could recommend
5-FU-based chemotherapy to these patients. Especially,
for the advanced patients with distant metastasis, because
the improved survival of the low-risk patients must be
attributed to 5-FU-based chemotherapy, the signature
could identify the patients who can benefit from 5-FUbased chemotherapy. To recognize the patients who are
sensitive or resistant to 5-FU, we need gene expression
profiles of patients with explicit information of response,
which, however, are currently scarce in public databases.
Also, future work is needed to study whether it is possible
to design novel drugs targeting the genomic or epigenomic
lesions characterizing the patients who cannot benefit from
5-FU-based chemotherapy.
In summary, the discovery that the REOs-based
signature could robustly predict prognoses of 5-FUtreated gastric cancer patients will provide a translational
biomarker in further stratifying the gastric cancer patients
for 5-FU response. The multi-omics characteristics of the
high-risk patients would expand our understanding of the
mechanisms underlying 5-FU resistance in gastric cancer
and provide novel therapeutic targets to overcome 5-FU
resistance of gastric patients in the future.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we developed a signature consisting of
two gene pairs whose within-sample REOs were prognostic
for gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based
chemotherapy. This REOs-based signature could perform
robustly in independent datasets produced by different
laboratories and could be easily applied at the individual
levels. With this unique advantage, we were able to transform
the transcriptional signature to other omics signature using
the TCGA multi-omics data as a pivot. This strategy
makes it feasible to explore the genomic and epigenomic
characteristics of prognostic groups using the TCGA multiomics data which would otherwise be largely unsuitable for
prognostic analyses because the diverse chemo-regimens
could confound the survival outcomes. Our analyses showed
that the high-risk patients had frequent amplification of
genes affecting DNA repair, cell cycle regulation and
apoptosis, indicating that they had high malignant degree of
tumors. Meanwhile, the hypermethylation-mediated downregulation of genes in the high-risk group mainly affected
pyrimidine and folate metabolism, which might decrease the
conversion of 5-FU to active metabolites and inhibit 5-FUinduced DNA or RNA damage. In contrast, the low-risk
patients were characterized with frequent mutation of genes
enriched in Wnt signaling, Ras signaling and Regulation of
autophagy pathways, implying that these mutation-induced
disturbances might facilitate 5-FU efficacy.
We need to clarify that we should not simply
conclude that the high-risk patients identified by the
prognostic signature are all resistant to 5-FU-based
chemotherapy. Some of the high-risk patients’ tumor
could be indeed resistant to 5-FU-induced DNA or RNA
damage [48], while some others might be sensitive to
5-FU but their tumor cell growth ability outperforms the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data and pre-processing
Data for gastric cancer cell lines and tissues were
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and TCGA (http://
cancergenome.nih.gov/), as described in details in Table 1.
The raw data (.CEL files) of microarray platforms were
processed using the Robust Multichip Average algorithm
[52]. Probe IDs were mapped to gene IDs using the
corresponding platform files. If multiple probes were
mapped to the same gene, the expression value for the gene
was summarized as the arithmetic mean of the values of
the multiple probes. The mRNA-seq profiles of level 3 for
TCGA samples were downloaded from TCGA portal. We
removed genes whose expression measurements were at or
below a noise threshold of 0.2 reads per kilobase per million
mapped reads (RPKM) in at least 75% of samples [29].
Copy number data of level 4 for TCGA samples
analyzed by the GISTIC 2.0 algorithm [53] were

Concordance scores

downloaded
from
Firehose
(https://confluence.
broadinstitute.org/display/GDAC/Download). Using the
significant regions of gain or loss identified by GISTIC
2.0, we assigned a discrete copy number alteration status
to each gene in each sample. Gene mutation data of level
2 and DNA methylation data of level 3 for TCGA samples
were downloaded from TCGA portal. For gene mutation
data, only the non-synonymous mutations were included
in our analysis. By integrating mutation data produced
by different platforms, we generated a discrete mutation
profile including 18,916 genes. DNA methylation profiles
of level 3 provided beta-value for each CpG site in each
sample. We focused on the 25,978 CpG sites located at
the promoter regions of genes, which were measured
by Illumina Infinium Human DNA methylation 450 and
27 platforms. Probes that had any “NA”-masked data
points and that were designed for sequences on X and Y
chromosomes were removed [29]. Probe IDs were mapped
to gene IDs using the corresponding platform file. If
multiple probes were mapped to the same gene, the betavalue for this gene was summarized as the arithmetic mean
of the values of the multiple probes. Totally, 21,993 CpG
sites mapped to 12,803 genes were analyzed in this study.
The human protein-protein interaction (PPI) data
including 142,583 distinct interactions and 13,693 human
proteins were collected as previously described [54].
The types of interaction relationships between proteins
included physical interaction, transcriptional regulation
and sequential catalysis.

If two lists of DEGs detected separately from two
datasets had k overlapped genes, among which s genes
showed the same deregulation directions (up- or downregulation) in the two DEGs lists, then the concordance
score was calculated as s/k. This score was used to evaluate
the consistence of DEGs extracted from independent
datasets.
If k genes were found to be correlated with both
5-FU GI50 of cell lines and patients’ OS, among which
s genes had the same signs positively (or negatively)
correlated with 5-FU GI50 of cell lines and correspondingly
negatively (or positively) correlated with patients’ OS,
then the concordance score was calculated as s/k. This
score was used to evaluate the clinical relevance of the
GI50-related genes.
If k genes had both methylation and expression
changes, among which s genes were hypermethylated (or
hypomethylated) and correspondingly down-regulated
(or up-regulated), then the concordance score was
calculated as s/k. This score was used to evaluate the
concordance of hypermethylation (or hypomethylation)
with down-regulation (or up-regulation).
The probability of observing a concordance score of
s/k by chance was evaluated by the cumulative binomial
distribution model as following:
s −1 k
 
P = 1 − ∑  ( Pe )i (1 − Pe ) k −1
i =0  i 

Correlation and survival analysis

where Pe is the probability of one gene having the
concordant relationship between the two lists of genes by
chance (here , Pe = 0.5).

The Pearson correlation analysis was used to
evaluate the correlation of genes expression levels with
GI50 values of cell lines. The univariate Cox regression
model was used to evaluate the correlation of gene
expression levels and REOs of gene pairs with OS, and the
multivariate Cox regression model was used to evaluate
the independent prognostic value of the signature after
adjusting for clinical factors including stage, grade and
gender. Survival curves were estimated by the KaplanMeier method and compared with log-rank test.

Analysis of genomic and epigenomic data
The Student’s t-test was used to select DEGs
between two groups of samples. The Rank Products
algorithm [55], which is insensitive to batch effects, was
used to select DEGs and differential DNA methylation
genes (DMGs) between two groups of TCGA samples
derived from multiple experimental batches.
Fisher’s exact test was conducted to extract genes
which had significantly different frequencies of copy
number alterations and mutation between two groups of
TCGA samples. Spearman rank correlation analysis was
used to evaluate the correlation between copy number
alterations and expression changes after removing the
batch effects by ComBat for TCGA samples [56].

Development of the prognostic signature
Let Ea and Eb represent the expression levels of
two candidate genes, a and b, respectively, we classified
cancer samples into two groups according to the withinsample REO (Ea > Eb or Ea < Eb) of this gene pair. If the
two groups of samples had significantly different OS, then
we defined this gene pair as a prognosis-associated gene
pair. If the Ea > Eb REO was associated with poor OS,
then this REO voted for high risk; otherwise, low risk.
All the prognosis-associated gene pairs were selected as
prognostic signature. Finally, a sample was predicted to be
of high risk if the REOs of all gene pairs of the signature
in this sample voted for high risk; otherwise, low risk.
