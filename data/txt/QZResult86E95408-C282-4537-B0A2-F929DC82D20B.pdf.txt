Abstract
Hypoxia is a prominent feature of solid tumor development
and is known to stimulate mitochondrial ROS (mROS), which,
in turn, can activate hypoxia-inducible transcription factor1A and nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB). Because NF-KB plays a
central role in carcinogenesis, we examined the mechanism of
mROS-mediated NF-KB activation and the fate of cancer cells
during hypoxia after mitochondrial reduced glutathione
(mGSH) depletion. Hypoxia generated mROS in hepatoma
(HepG2, H35), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), and colon carcinoma (DLD-1) cells, leading to hypoxia-inducible transcription
factor-1A–dependent gene expression and c-Src activation
that was prevented in cells expressing a redox-insensitive c-Src
mutant (C487A). c-Src stimulation activated NF-KB without
IKB-A degradation due to IKB-A tyrosine phosphorylation
that was inhibited by rotenone/TTFA or c-Src antagonism. The
c-Src–NF-KB signaling contributed to the survival of cells
during hypoxia as c-Src inhibition or p65 down-regulation by
small interfering RNA–sensitized HepG2 cells to hypoxiainduced cell death. Moreover, selective mGSH depletion
resulted in an accelerated and enhanced mROS generation
by hypoxia that killed SH-SY5Y and DLD-1 cells without
disabling the c-Src–NF-KB pathway. Thus, although mROS
promote cell survival by NF-KB activation via c-Src, mROS
overgeneration may be exploited to sensitize cancer cells to
hypoxia. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7368–77]

Introduction
Hypoxia is an inherent and key feature of solid tumor
development that arises due to the disorganized structure and
architecture of tumor vasculature resulting in irregular and
inefficient oxygen delivery, and is considered a negative prognostic
factor for response to treatment and survival of cancer patients
(1–3). A central pathway in oxygen sensing that mediates the gene
expression reprogramming and the adaptation to this stressful
condition is the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 (HIF-1), a
heterodimer transcription factor comprised by a and h subunits,

which induces a cadre of genes that promote angiogenesis, survival,
glycolysis, and tumor progression (4–6). Although the h subunit is
constitutively expressed, the expression of the HIF-1a subunits is
tightly regulated by oxygen through the action of prolyl hydroxylase
(PHD) and asparaginyl hydroxylase (7–10). In the presence of
oxygen, iron, or 2-oxoglutarate, PHDs hydroxylate specific proline
residues within the oxygen-dependent domain of HIF-1a, enabling
its binding to the von Hippel-Landau tumor suppressor protein, a
component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that leads to the
ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation
of HIF-1a subunits (10–12). PHDs belong to the iron (II)-2oxoglutarate–dependent dioxygenase family and are thought to be
effective oxygen sensors as their K m values for oxygen are above the
atmospheric oxygen concentration (13).
In addition to the role of PHDs as oxygen sensors, an alternative
model proposes mitochondria as critical players in oxygen sensing
through inhibition of PHDs. This mitochondrial model, however,
has been controversial because previous studies relied on
pharmacologic tools with the appearance of conflicting reports
(14, 15) and also due to technical concerns regarding the
measurement of ROS production in living cells. However, recent
studies using genetic and biochemical approaches have provided
clear-cut evidence for a role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (mROS) in oxygen sensing and HIF-1a activation (16–18).
Indeed, blocking superoxide anion production by suppressing the
Rieske iron-sulfur protein of complex III impairs HIF-1a induction
by hypoxia, and, moreover, hydrogen peroxide or agents that
produce ROS activate HIF-1a during normoxia (17, 18), indicating a
central role for ROS in the stabilization of HIF-1a. Furthermore,
hypoxia-induced mROS have been shown to enhance the DNA
binding of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) through a redox-dependent
mechanism (19). The prototypical pathway leading to NF-nB
activation by a wide variety of stimuli involves the phosphorylation
of InB at specific serine residues that targets its subsequent
degradation by the proteasome (20–22). The released subunits of
NF-nB then translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific
sites in the promoter/enhancer region of target genes. An additional pathway of NF-nB activation entails the release of the DNA
binding–competent dimers of NF-nB from InB-a without the
proteolytic degradation of the latter. Indeed, the phosphorylation
of InB-a at tyrosine residues has been shown to activate NF-nB
without InB-a degradation (23).
Compared with HIF-1a, the regulation of NF-nB during hypoxia
has been less studied, and although the phenomenon was observed
in the past, the molecular mechanisms involved remained unclear.
In this regard, hypoxia (0.02% O2) has been reported to activate NFnB through the phosphorylation of InB-a on tyrosine residues;

however, this outcome was accompanied by the proteolytic
degradation of InB-a (24). Furthermore, Imbert et al. reported
that hypoxia failed to phosphorylate InB-a in tyrosine residues as
opposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation or pervanadate, which activated
NF-nB in the absence of InB-a degradation (23, 25). Moreover,
hypoxia/reoxygenation in HeLa cells induced the phosphorylation
of InB-a on tyrosine residues and NF-nB activation through c-Src
activation, a redox-regulated tyrosine kinase, that were prevented
by extramitochondrial antioxidant enzymes but not by manganese
superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) overexpression (26).
Given the central role of NF-nB and hypoxia in cell survival and
carcinogenesis, and because the functional relation between
mROS–c-Src–NF-nB during hypoxia has not been established, our
aim was first to characterize the mechanisms of mROS-mediated
NF-nB activation by hypoxia. Moreover, because mitochondrial
reduced glutathione (mGSH) has been shown to modulate the
hepatocellular susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/Fas or
hypoxia via mROS regulation (27–29), we examined the regulation
of c-Src and NF-nB after mGSH depletion and the sensitivity of
cancer cells to hypoxia. Our findings reveal a dual role of mROS
generated during hypoxia, promoting either cell survival through
NF-nB activation via c-Src or cell death if overgenerated, suggesting
that strategies to stimulate mROS production may be exploited
therapeutically to turn the hypoxic environment of solid tumors
into an armamentarium to kill cancer cells.

Bioscience and Promega, respectively. The hypoxia response element (HRE)
luciferase reporter was a generous gift from Dr. A.J. Giaccia (Stanford
University, Palo Alto, CA).
Cell culture and incubation. The hepatoblastoma HepG2, H35, and the
human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were obtained from the European
Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, Wilts, United Kingdom).
SW480 and DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells were a kind gift of Dr. A.
Villanueva (IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain). Cells were cultured in DMEM
containing high glucose levels, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
(56jC, 30 min) fetal bovine serum; 2 mmol/L L-glutamine; 100 units/mL
penicillin; 100 Ag/mL streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere at 37jC,
and 5% CO2, and 21% O2 (called normoxic conditions). Hypoxic conditions
were attained by exposure to 5% to 2% O2 and 5% CO2 in a humidified
incubator (Forma Scientific) in sealed flasks for 24 to 72 h as previously
described (28). In some cases, hypoxia cells were exposed to inhibitors
of mitochondrial electron flow at complexes I/II [rotenone plus TTFA
(R/T)] or III (antimycin A), or GSH depletors diethylmaleate and (R,S)3-hydroxy-4-pentenoate (HP). In control experiments, we verified that
the instantaneous opening of flasks in the incubator for 10 to 15 s did
not result in enhanced ROS stimulation with respect to hypoxic unperturbed flasks (not shown).
Measurement of ROS and cytotoxicity assessment. Hydroethidine
(excitation 495 / emission 610) and DCF (excitation 495 / emission 525)
fluorescence were determined in a fluorometer at 37jC and the data were
normalized to values obtained from normoxic, untreated controls as

described before (27, 29). Cytotoxicity was determined by the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay or
through the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium. In some
cases, cells were stained with Hoechst 33528 and propidium iodide to
examine the extent of apoptotic/necrotic cell death.
Preparation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts. Nuclear and cytosolic
extracts of HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cells were prepared by lysing cells with
Igepal CA-630 followed by differential centrifugation as before (30, 31).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Activation of transcription factor
NF-nB was assessed using consensus oligonucleotides of NF-nB (5¶-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3¶), with probes labeled as described before (30, 31).
IKB-A immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. HepG2 cells
(20  106) were treated with 200 Amol/L sodium orthovanadate for 30 min
in normoxia or with 10 Amol/L PP2 or 100 Amol/L piceatannol during
hypoxia. Cells were lysed with 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 50 mmol/L Tris,
120 mmol/L Tris, 120 mmol/L NaCl (pH 7.8), 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L NaF, and incubated for
30 min at 4jC and cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000  g for
15 min at 4jC. Immunoprecipitation was done using 2 Ag InB-a antibody
and 40 AL protein G–agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at
4jC. The precipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer. Membranes
were saturated with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin) for 18 h at
room temperature and then probed with a mouse anti–phosphotyrosineHRP–conjugated antibody for 45 min at room temperature. The blots were
stained with Ponceau S to confirm the uniformity of protein loading in each
lane. Immunodetections were carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences).
RNA isolation and real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Briefly, 20 ng
of total RNA, 600 Amol/L of primers, and 12.5 AL of 2 reaction mix were
incubated in 25 AL at 50jC for 10 min and 95jC for 5 min, followed by 45
cycles of 95jC for 10 s, 56jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 30 s. Each reaction was
run in duplicate and the threshold (C T) values for each mRNA were
subtracted from that of h-actin mRNA, averaged, and converted from loglinear to linear term. The primer sequences used were as follows: b-actin
forward 5¶-TTGCCGACAGGATGCAGAA-3¶, reverse 5¶-GCCGATCCACACGGAGTACT-3¶; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) forward 5¶-GAAGCAGTTCCTGGACTTCG-3¶, reverse 5¶-ACCAATTGAACGGATGGTGT-3¶;
cIAP-2 forward 5¶-GTGATGGTGGACTCAGGTGTTG-3¶, reverse 5¶-TCCTGTCCTTTAATTCTTATCAAGTACTCA-3¶; vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) forward 5¶-CTACCTCCACCATGCCAAGTG-3¶, reverse 5¶-TGCGCTGATAGACATCCATGA-3¶; and MnSOD forward 5¶-AACGTCACCGAGGAGAAGTA-3¶, reverse 5¶-GGCTGAGGTTTGTCCAGAAA-3¶.
mGSH depletion. The neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y or the colon
carcinoma cell line DLD-1 were preincubated with HP (10 mmol/L, 10 min)
to deplete mGSH as described before (27–29). HP undergoes a biotransformation into a Michael electrophile in the matrix, which is then
conjugated with GSH.
Cell transfection with reporter constructs. Briefly, 5  105 cells were
plated onto a 24-well culture plate and transiently transfected using
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with the corresponding reporter plasmid
(pNF-nB-Luc or HRE-Luc), the presence or absence of the different c-Src
mutants, and phRL-TK for normalization. Cells were harvested 48 to 72 h
after transfection, and the Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were
measured with the dual luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega).
Site-directed mutagenesis. pSG5 vector–based constructs expressing
wild-type Src and its mutants Src C245A and Src C487A were generated as
described previously (32), using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene), confirmed by sequencing, and transfected in HepG2 cells
with LipofectAMINE 2000.
Silencing of p65 expression. Specific predesigned small interfering
RNAs (siRNA) were ordered to Santa Cruz Biotechnology and transfected in
hepatoma cells (HepG2 and H35) with siPORT Amine cationic solution from
Ambion according to the manufacturer’s instructions. siRNA with
equivalent %GC nucleotide content was used as a control. Cells were
assayed usually 36 to 72 h after siRNA duplexes transfection. The effect of
p65 suppression was monitored by p65 mRNA and protein levels.

Results
Hypoxia-induced mROS activate NF-KB and stabilize HIF1A in HepG2 cells. Hypoxia has been shown to induce an early
burst of mROS, which regulate gene expression through activation
of transcription factors NF-nB and HIF-1a (16–19), with most
studies using severe oxygen deprivation (typically 0.02–1.5%). In the
liver, the anatomic structure of this organ determines an O2
gradient along the acinus as a result of the unidirectional blood
flow from the portal vein and hepatic artery to the central vein. The
oxygen tension in these populations of hepatocytes ranges from 65
to 60 mm Hg (f10–8% O2) in the periportal area to 35 to 30 mm
Hg (f8–5% O2) in the perivenous area (34), indicating a hypoxic
environment in the latter cell types relative to the former. Because
we have recently shown that 5% O2 increased mROS (28), we
analyzed the regulation of NF-nB and HIF-1a in hepatoma cells
subjected to 5% O2 compared with normoxia. The levels of ROS
monitored as DCF fluorescence increased at 24 to 72 h after
exposure of HepG2 cells to 5% O2 (Fig. 1A), and the magnitude of
DCF fluorescence increased further when cells were exposed to 2%
O2 (not shown). Moreover, similar observations were made with the
rat hepatoma cell line H35 in which hypoxia-induced DCF
fluorescence was lower than in isolated rat hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. S1). Inhibition of mitochondrial electron flow at
complexes I and II with R/T prevented the stimulation of ROS by
5% O2 (Fig. 1A), whereas antimycin A enhanced the generation of
ROS caused by 5% O2, consistent with previous findings (28, 33).
Next, using nuclear extracts prepared at different times during
hypoxia, we observed enhanced DNA binding activity of NF-nB that
was displaced by an excess of unlabeled nB (Fig. 1B). The timedependent NF-nB activation paralleled that of mROS generation,
with no activation observed before 24 h of exposure to 5% O2 (not
shown). Hypoxia activated the p65/p50 and p50/p50 dimers as
revealed in supershift assays using specific antibodies (Fig. 1B).
In addition, a lower molecular weight complex not shifted by any
of the antibodies used as well as c-Rel and RelB (not shown) was
detected (Fig. 1B), although its relevance is uncertain because this
complex was not specific for nB (Fig. 1B). Moreover, Western blot
analyses of nuclear extracts revealed enhanced levels of HIF-1a
during hypoxia (Fig. 1C and D). To assess the contribution of the
mROS generation in the activation of NF-nB and HIF-1a
stabilization, their regulation was examined in conditions in which
mROS generation was modulated. R/T blocked the DNA binding
activity of NF-nB and ameliorated the stabilization of HIF-1a
caused by hypoxia (Fig. 1A–C). Moreover, the transcriptional
activity of HIF-1a and NF-nB during 5% O2 was examined using a
HRE-luciferase reporter and by real-time PCR. Hypoxia enhanced
the luciferase activity in HepG2 cells transfected with the reported
construct (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the mRNA levels of HIF-1a and NFnB target genes such as VEGF, PDK1, and the antiapoptotic protein
cIAP-2, respectively, increased by hypoxia (Fig. 2A). Moreover, R/T
treatment prevented hypoxia-induced VEGF, PDK1, and cIAP-2
mRNA levels, whereas antimycin A did not (Fig. 2A). Together,
these findings validate the involvement of mROS generation in the
activation of NF-nB and HIF-1a stabilization by hypoxia.
Hypoxia activates NF-KB without IKB-A degradation via
IKB-A tyrosine phosphorylation. As outlined above, the mechanism of NF-nB activation by hypoxia has not been well estab-

lished, particularly in the light of the different fate of InB-a after
phosphorylation at serine or tyrosine residues that determine the
degradation or not, respectively, of InB-a by the proteasome (21–23,
25, 35). Thus, we examined the phosphorylation state of InB-a
during hypoxia in hepatoma cells. In contrast to prior observations
in Jurkat T-cells subjected to very low oxygen concentrations (24),
the levels of InB-a remained constant during 5% O2 exposure,
similar to the levels of normoxic cells (Fig. 2B), and this outcome
resulted in enhanced NF-nB DNA binding (Fig. 1B). To further
validate this finding, HepG2 cells were exposed to TNF, a cytokine
that activates NF-nB by the proteasome-mediated degradation of
InB-a secondary to its phosphorylation in serine 32. Unlike hypoxia,
TNF (100 units/mL for 30 min) decreased the levels of InB-a
(Fig. 2B), and this outcome was accompanied by p65/p50– and p50/
p50–enhanced DNA binding (not shown). Moreover, in conditions
in which the proteasome was inhibited by N-acetyl-leucyl-leucylnorleucinal, TNF induced the phosphorylation of InB-a at Ser32,
whereas hypoxia did not (Fig. 2B). To monitor if InB-a was
phosphorylated in tyrosine residues, InB-a was immunoprecipitated and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As seen,
hypoxia increased the phosphorylation of InB-a in tyrosine residues
(Fig. 2C), with similar results observed upon pervanadate exposure
(Supplementary Fig. S2), in agreement with previous reports
(23, 35). Taken together, these findings indicate that hypoxia per se
activates NF-nB via tyrosine InB-a phosphorylation in the absence
of InB-a degradation.
Critical role of Cys487 in hypoxia-induced c-Src activation.
Next, we examined the involvement of specific tyrosine kinases that
may have contributed to the tyrosine phosphorylation of InB-a
during hypoxia. We focused on c-Src, a 60-kDa prototypical Src
family member that plays an important role in cell cycle control,
adhesion, and oncogenesis, because previous observations in HeLa
cells implicated this particular kinase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of InB-a after hypoxia/reoxygenation (26). We first examined
the activation of c-Src after exposure to 5% O2. Compared with
normoxia, the level of c-Src did not change during the time course of
hypoxia. However, the phosphorylation of c-Src in Tyr416 increased
during hypoxia, whereas that of Tyr527 did not (Fig. 2D ).
Furthermore, consistent with the inhibitory effect of R/T on mROS
generation and NF-nB activation (Fig. 1A and B), these mitochondrial inhibitors prevented the phosphorylation of c-Src at Tyr416,
whereas antimycin A, which potentiated mROS (Fig. 1A), enhanced
the levels of c-Src Tyr416 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). The functional
link between mROS generation by hypoxia and the subsequent
activation of c-Src was further studied using oxidant insensitive
c-Src mutants. Although five cysteine residues, Cys238, Cys245, Cys400,
Cys487, and Cys498, are conserved among all c-Src family members,
the mutants C245A and C487A in which the Cys245 of the SH2
domain and Cys487 of the kinase domain, respectively, were replaced
by alanine residues were chosen as these mutants were reported to
play a critical role in adhesion-dependent c-Src activation (32).
Hypoxia stimulated Src Tyr416 phosphorylation in C245A mutants,
but not in C487A mutants (Fig. 2D), indicating a critical role for
Cys487 in c-Src activation by hypoxia.
mROS-induced c-Src stimulation activates NF-KB. Next, we
determined the role of c-Src in NF-nB activation by examining the
effect of PP2, a c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, versus piceatannol
that selectively inhibits ZAP-70/Syk kinase (35–37). PP2 blocked
the activation of c-Src monitored as the phosphorylation of Tyr416
(Fig. 2D) and prevented the tyrosine phosphorylation of InB-a
(Fig. 2C), the subsequent DNA binding activity of NF-nB (Fig. 3A),

and the c-IAP2 expression by hypoxia (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the
tyrosine phosphorylation of InB-a (Fig. 2C) and the NF-nB
activation by hypoxia still occurred in the presence of piceatannol
(Fig. 3A), discarding a role for ZAP-70 and Syk Src family members
in the activation of NF-nB by hypoxia. To further validate the role
of c-Src, we examined the effect of C245A and C487A c-Src mutants
in the activation of NF-nB by hypoxia using the reporter plasmid
pNF-nB-Luc. The activation of NF-nB occurred both in wild-type
c-Src and C245A mutants and this outcome was ameliorated in
C487A mutants-expressing cells (Fig. 3B), consistent with the
findings on the critical role of Cys487 in c-Src activation by hypoxia.
In contrast, neither PP2 nor the transfection of the c-Src constructs
prevented the activation of HIF-a induced by hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S3). These findings establish a functional link between
the c-Src and NF-nB during hypoxia.

NF-KB down-regulation or c-Src inhibition sensitizes hepatoma cells to hypoxia. Given the critical role of NF-nB in cell
survival, we next examined the effect of NF-nB down-regulation on
the cellular susceptibility to hypoxia. The p65 member of NF-nB in
HepG2 cells was targeted by siRNA, examining the survival during
exposure to 5% O2. Transfection of cells with p65 siRNA
significantly reduced the mRNA levels of p65 compared with cells
transfected with a scrambled control siRNA (Fig. 3C). Furthermore,
p65 siRNA reduced the levels of p65 in nuclear extracts after
hypoxia exposure compared with cells transfected with scrambled
control siRNA (Fig. 3C). Moreover, although cells transfected with
the control siRNA were resistant to 5% O2, as expected based on
previous findings (38), HepG2 cells transfected with p65 siRNA
exhibited a significant susceptibility to hypoxia-induced cell death
(Fig. 3D). Similar results were observed with H35 hepatoma cells

(not shown). Furthermore, consistent with the upstream role of
c-Src in the activation of NF-nB, PP2 that prevented the NF-nB
activation (Fig. 3A) sensitized HepG2 cells to hypoxia although to a
lesser extent than that observed upon p65 down-regulation
(Fig. 3D). To further analyze the potential mechanism underlying
the susceptibility to hypoxia after NF-nB down-regulation, we
focused on the regulation of MnSOD, a known nB-controlled
antioxidant enzyme. As seen, MnSOD expression was reduced upon
p65 down-regulation by siRNA (Fig. 3C), translating in a significant
overgeneration of mROS by 5% O2 (Fig. 3D). However, MnTBAP, a
cell-permeable porphyrin SOD mimetic, reduced mROS generation
and protected HepG2 cells against 5% O2 after p65 siRNA exposure
(Fig. 3D). Hence, these findings indicate that the c-Src–NF-nB
signaling protects hepatoma cells during hypoxia, in part, through
the nB-regulated MnSOD.
mGSH depletion sensitizes cancer cells to hypoxia without
disabling the c-Src-NF-KB signaling. Because mGSH regulates
mROS generation (39), we addressed whether mROS overgeneration by mGSH depletion sensitizes cancer cells to hypoxia. mGSH
depletion can be achieved in vitro in a selective fashion by
incubation of cells with HP, which is biotransformed in mitochondria into a Michael electrophile, being conjugated with matrix
GSH with the sparing of cytosolic GSH (27–29, 40). Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with HP, examining the
compartmentation of GSH into the cytosol and mitochondria. HP
led to a selective depletion of mGSH by 60% to 70% without effect
on the cytosol pool of GSH (Fig. 4A). Because most studies used low
oxygen concentrations (up to 1.5–2%), we examined the effect of
HP in the susceptibility to 2% O2. HP treatment enhanced hypoxiainduced ROS generation in SH-SY5Y (Fig. 4A) that translated in a

significant loss of cell viability (Fig. 4B). Staining cells with Hoechst
33258 and propidium iodide indicated a predominant population of
propidium iodide–positive cells with minimal altered chromatin
morphology (Fig. 4C). Similar findings in terms of ROS production
and survival after HP treatment were observed during the exposure
of cells to 5% O2 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Furthermore, HP
selectively depleted mGSH in colon carcinoma DLD-1 cells, resulting
in their sensitization to hypoxia-induced cell death (Fig. 4D). The
susceptibility to hypoxia by HP in SH-SY5Y and DLD-1 cells was
prevented by the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene or incubation with GSH-ethyl ester (not shown). Unlike SH-SY5Y and DLD-1
cells, several hepatoma cells tested, including HepG2, Hep3B, H35,
or Hepa1c1c7, failed to respond to the selective mGSH depletion by
HP (not shown), due to the inability to these cells to generate the
3-oxo-4-pentenoate derivative from HP within the mitochondria
(41). In addition, the selective decrease of the cytosolic GSH levels
by diethylmaleate (0.2 mmol/L) was not effective in inducing cell
death by hypoxia nor did it increase mROS production (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6), thus underscoring the importance of the
mitochondrial pool of GSH rather than cytosol GSH in the regulation
of mROS and protection against hypoxia.
Furthermore, because ROS plays a bifunctional role in the
regulation of NF-nB, we examined the relationship of the mGSH
depletion–mediated susceptibility to hypoxia with the c-Src–NF-nB
pathway. Kinetic analyses of pTyr416 c-Src phosphorylation and p65
levels in nuclear extracts revealed that HP pretreatment neither
prevented the activation of c-Src and NF-nB caused by hypoxia
(Fig. 5A) nor changed the activation of HIF-1a measured using an
HRE reporter vector (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, HP
treatment did result in an accelerated and enhanced burst of

mROS by hypoxia (Fig. 5B), and this enhanced ROS formation
mirrored the temporal reduction of cell viability during hypoxia
(Fig. 5C). Moreover, consistent with these findings, HP potentiated
the release of Smac/DIABLO and cytochrome c during hypoxia
(Fig. 5D) and mitochondrial membrane depolarization (not
shown). These findings establish a critical role for mROS in the
susceptibility to hypoxia.

Discussion
The present study addressed the role of mROS in the survival/
susceptibility of cancer cells during hypoxia. Hypoxia is a
prominent feature of solid tumor development considered a major
driving force for tumor progression. Indeed, the higher malignancy

www.aacrjournals.org

of hypoxic tumors has been attributed to the ability of hypoxia to
select for cells that are resistant to cell death and to the increase in
tumor cell invasiveness (1–3, 42). Thus, strategies that sensitize
cancer cells to hypoxia may be of therapeutic relevance.
Our findings highlight a dual role of mROS in hypoxia signaling
(Fig. 6). The generation of ROS during hypoxia, and their role in
oxygen sensing, has been a controversial issue (6, 14, 15). However,
recent compelling evidence using genetic and biochemical approaches indicated a burst of mROS at mitochondrial complex III.
Although the exact mechanisms involved are currently unknown,
mROS generation by hypoxia stabilize HIF-1a with the Rieske ironsulfur protein-mediated superoxide anion generation playing a
crucial role (16–18). The regulation of PHDs by oxidant signals is
poorly understood, and the mechanism of mROS-mediated PHD

inhibition underlying the reported HIF-1a stabilization remains to
be established. Nevertheless, mROS can inhibit PHDs as a result of
ROS-mediated depletion of ascorbate, which could limit the
regeneration of Fe (II) from Fe (III) needed for PHD activity.
Moreover, despite the role for oxidant-dependent HIF-1a stabilization, there is also evidence for the regulation of HIF-1a independently of ROS. For instance, recent findings have indicated that
accumulation of succinate in normoxia due to the deletion of
succinate dehydrogenase induced the HIF-1a transcriptional
activity through inhibition of PHD (43). Consistent with this
conception, we observed that R/T ameliorated the stabilization of
HIF-1a although it efficiently prevented the mROS burst generated
by hypoxia.
We established a functional link between the mROS production
and the activation of NF-nB through c-Src stimulation (Fig. 6).

Although the activation of NF-nB by hypoxia has been described,
the mechanism involved was poorly characterized with a number
of inconsistencies regarding the differential fate of InB-a after
phosphorylation in serine or tyrosine residues (23–25). Our data
indicate that the early burst of mROS links c-Src with NF-nB
activation through tyrosine InB-a phosphorylation, as R/T, which
prevents mROS generation, blocks the appearance of a Tyr416
phosphorylated form of c-Src, indicating a role for superoxide
anion generation in this event. Due to the reactivity of superoxide
anion and its expected low diffusion from mitochondria, it is likely
that its conversion into hydrogen peroxide and diffusion into
cytosol may target the redox-sensitive c-Src Cys487. Our findings
linking mROS with c-Src are consistent with those observed in
vascular smooth muscle cells cultured under an oxygen tension of
<1 mm Hg, as rotenone and DPI abolished the mitochondrial ROS

generation and c-Src activation induced by hypoxia (44). Furthermore, recent observations reported the recruitment of c-Src to
mitochondria by Dok-4, a downstream of kinase family of adapter
proteins, resulting in mitochondrial complex I down-regulation,
ROS generation, and NF-nB activation by TNF (45). Whether the
putative trafficking of c-Src to mitochondria played a role in
hypoxia-induced c-Src activation remains to be established.
Although we observe that cells are resistant to 5% O2, as previously

reported (38), NF-nB appears to modulate the susceptibility of
hepatoma cells to hypoxia, in agreement with previous observations in ventricular myocytes (46), possibly due to the regulation of
mROS generation via MnSOD, although other factors such as the
repression of the death gene BNIP3 by NF-nB may also play a role.
Given the key role of HIF-1a stabilization and NF-nB activation
in promoting survival of cancer cells, angiogenesis, neovascularization, glycolytic ATP generation, and tumor invasion (1, 2, 10), and

Figure 6. Dual role of mROS in hypoxia signaling.
Hypoxia generates mROS, which, in turn, activate NF-nB
through c-Src–mediated phosphorylation of InB-a at
tyrosine residues, and the stabilization of HIF-1a. These
events promote carcinogenesis through maintenance of
cell survival and tumor progression. However, when mGSH
is depleted, hypoxia induces an enhanced formation of
mROS stimulating the release of cytochrome c , resulting in
oxidant-dependent cell death.

consistent with the view that ROS promote carcinogenesis (47), our
findings suggest that hypoxia-induced mROS act as procarcinogenic signals. In addition, cancer cells exhibit greater ROS
generation determining an intrinsic oxidative stress that could
contribute to their vulnerability to free radical–induced cell death.
Consistent with this view, we observe that mROS overgeneration
due to mGSH depletion determines the susceptibility of cancer
cells to hypoxia, suggesting that this strategy may be of relevance to
turn the hypoxic environment of solid tumors into a therapeutic
milieu to kill cancer cells. Interestingly, although we observed the
mitochondrial release of apoptotic factors, most of the cells dying
during hypoxia after mGSH depletion exhibit necrotic features
possibly due to the overgeneration of mROS under these
conditions. In this regard, a dual role for oxidants and ROS in
the regulation of caspase activity has been described, implying that
excess ROS inhibit caspases favoring the necrotic demise of cells
(48). Despite that the selective depletion of mGSH by HP is cell type
specific, strategies that result in total cell GSH depletion (cytosol
and mitochondrial pools) may be also useful to kill cancer cells, as
the mitochondrial GSH pool derives from the cytosol GSH pool
(39). In this regard, recent observations reported the killing of
oncogenically transformed cells through a ROS-mediated mechanism by h-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), which depletes total
GSH levels, although the regulation of mGSH was not examined
(49). Moreover, we have shown that diethylmaleate and buthionineL-sulfoximine, which deplete GSH levels both in cytosol and
mitochondria, sensitized HepG2 cells to 5% O2–induced cell death,
which was prevented by R/T despite profound cytosol GSH
depletion (28). Unlike total GSH depletion, which blocks redoxdependent signals such as NF-nB as reported with PEITC (49), the
selective mGSH depletion by HP did not interfere with hypoxiainduced NF-nB activation or c-Src stimulation, and similar findings
in this regard have been recently reported with TNF (29). Therefore,

our observations along with prior reports describing that enhanced
ROS generation by blocking mitochondrial respiration effectively
kills human leukemia cells (50) highlight the potential of mROS
regulation in cancer therapy.
A caveat from our findings is that HP-mediated sensitization to
hypoxia is not specific for cancer cells (27–29). However, mGSH
depletion per se is not cytotoxic to normal or cancer cells, although
this outcome synergizes with hypoxia to overgenerate cytotoxic
amounts of mROS. Moreover, although a systematic comparison in
the susceptibility of cancer cells to hypoxia compared with their
normal counterparts is not always possible, it is known that
hepatoma cells are more resistant to hypoxia than primary
hepatocytes (28). Although the reason for this is unclear, many
tumor cells, including hepatoma cells, generate less mROS in
response to hypoxia than primary cells (28), by a mechanism related
to a lower respiratory rate and oxidative phosphorylation,
consistent with their dependency on glycolysis for energy production. Thus, although the pharmacologic depletion of mGSH may
occur in cancer and healthy cells after HP or other strategies that
cause total GSH loss, hypoxia is expected to predominantly affect
cancer cells from solid tumors, and hence the combination of
mGSH depletion and hypoxia may be of relevance in cancer therapy.
