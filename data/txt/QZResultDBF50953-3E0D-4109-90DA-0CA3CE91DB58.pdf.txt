Abstract

Inhibition of Eag1 by a Monoclonal Antibody

Emerging evidence indicates that ion channels act in a variety
of physiologic and pathologic processes beyond electronic
signal transmission, including in cancer. We recently found
that the potassium channel Eag1 can mediate cancer
progression and that a monoclonal antibody, which inhibits
Eag1 action, can effectively restrict cancer cell proliferation.
We discuss how Eag1 targeting may be useful in diagnostic or
therapeutic settings. [Cancer Res 2008;68(6):1611–3]

Among all voltage-gated potassium channels, two members of
the ether-à-go-go family, HERG (KCNH2, Kv11.1; ref. 5) and Eag1
(KCNH1, Kv10.1; ref. 3), have extensively been studied about their
implication in oncology. We have used Eag1 as a model for several
reasons. First, Eag1 is practically not detected in normal tissues
outside the central nervous system, but is aberrantly expressed
with very high frequency (>75%) in tumor cells from diverse origin
(6, 7). Channel activity has been measured in tumor cells (8–11),
showing that that the channel is located at the cell surface and
allowing the use of Eag1 to identify tumor cells. Second, it has been
shown that the inhibition of the channel expression and/or function
reduces tumor progression (10, 12, 13). An obvious conclusion of
these functional features of Eag1 is that specific blockade of the
channel with a compound effectively excluded by the blood brain
barrier could lead to a selective inhibition of the proliferation of
tumor cells. A large number of compounds have been described
to block Eag1, but none of them is specific. All known compounds
able to inhibit Eag1 also block HERG, implicating a cardiac safety
problem (14) because they could induce arrhythmia through
prolongation of the QT interval. Although this does not totally
disqualify Eag1 as a target for small-molecule inhibitors, it prompts
the design of alternative strategies.
We therefore approached the design of an anti-Eag1 functional
antibody (15). An antibody able to inhibit channel function would
offer several advantages. On the one hand, it should not recognize
related ion channels, and it should bind only to cells expressing
the epitope on their surface, which is essentially to tumor cells
in the case of Eag1. Previous attempts to generate functional
antibodies against ion channels gave rise to polyclonal sera (16),
but there were no precedents of monoclonal antibodies that
effectively block channels in intact cells. For Eag1 (and most other
ion channels), the domains exposed to the extracellular milieu
represent a small fraction of the total protein, limiting the areas
susceptible to be used as antigen. The problem was addressed by
constructing a fusion protein using two segments of the Eag1
channel: a region between the fifth transmembrane segment and
the pore-lining region (the E3 region; ref. 16) and a segment in the
COOH terminus that we had previously shown to form a very stable
tetrameric coiled-coil (17). This fusion protein was used as an
antigen and gave rise to a set of antibodies that were subsequently
selected for specificity and functional inhibition of the current by
electrophysiologic techniques.
We could show that the selected antibody can efficiently reduce
ion flow through Eag1 channels in intact cells. In addition, it does
not bind to Eag2 (KCNH5, Kv10.2) or to the physiologically relevant
HERG1, which is involved in controlling the length of the QT
interval in ventricular repolarization. This antibody is therefore the
first selective blocker of Eag1. Epitope mapping revealed that the
sequence recognized by the antibody lies close to the pore-lining
residues, in an area with very low homology to other channels.
Further characterization will be required to determine the exact
mechanism of action of the antibody in terms of channel blockade.

An Emerging Class of Cancer Targets
Ion channels constitute a numerous, abundant, and wellcharacterized group of proteins. Their therapeutic value derives
from their extracellular accessibility and because their functional
behavior can be studied at the single molecule level in real time,
allowing detailed optimization of drugs. This particular advantage
was not routinely applied to screening programs in the pharmaceutical industry because of limited throughput. Isotope fluxes and
fluorescent indicators were used instead. The introduction of novel
mid-throughput electrophysiologic techniques has now increased
the interest in this class of molecules. Nevertheless, ion channel
modulators have been used for a long time in the management of,
for example, hypertension, diabetes, and pain.
Although well established as therapeutic targets in excitable
cells, the role of voltage-gated potassium channels in the
physiology of nonexcitable cells has only recently caught the
attention of the scientific community. Oncology is no exception,
and although hints for the implication of ion channels in the
pathogenesis and evolution of cancer have been available for at
least 20 years (1), only recently a significant number of channels
have been directly linked to cancer, including sodium, chloride,
calcium, and potassium channels (e.g., refs. 2–5).
There are many analogies between ion channels and other
membrane receptors from the point of view of drug design. On a G
protein–coupled receptor or an enzymatic receptor, it is possible to
interfere from the extracellular side with the binding of the ligand
to its receptor, either directly or allosterically. All other possibilities
require access to the intracellular milieu. Ion channels are different
in the sense that their primary function, ion permeation, requires
physical contact between intracellular and extracellular media and
are therefore tractable in intact cells without needing to cross the
plasma membrane. Moreover, the interference with ion permeation
can be rather selective because the physical interaction with the
channel does not occur in the permeation pathway itself (which is
very similar in all channels with a given ionic selectivity) but at the
mouth of the channel, which has a variable sequence among the
various channels.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of Eag1 targeting for cancer. The high frequency of channel expression could be explained by a selective advantage for cells
expressing it in the tumoral environment. This can be used either by blocking antibodies that remove that advantage and thereby reduce tumor progression or as a tool
for recognizing tumor cells and target them with a more aggressive therapy. In both cases, the therapeutic approach would produce less undesired effects than
conventional therapies.

It is not clear whether the antibody inhibits ion permeation directly
or if it inhibits gating through allosteric interaction, although the
fact that opening of the channel is required for the block to be
established is suggestive of an open channel block mechanism. The

tumor cell growth. Thus far, all reports on the involvement of ion
channels in proliferation were based either on the specific inhibition
of the expression of an ion channel or on the use of relatively

unselective blockers. Toxins, which are as specific as antibodies,
have not been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, although
there are toxins against tumor-relevant channels (e.g., ref. 18). We
used our specific blocking antibody to show that inhibition of the
function of a particular ion channel, in this case Eag1, is able to
reduce colony formation of several tumor cell lines in a dosedependent manner. An isotype antibody as well as an Eag1-specific
antibody that did not block ion flow through Eag1 did not affect
colony formation efficiency, strongly indicating that the functional
activity of Eag1 is required for it to favor malignant phenotypic
features such as substrate-independent proliferation. In vivo i.p.
administration of the antibody was able to reduce tumor growth in
two different models, although the inhibition was modest and did
not happen in all cell types tested. It might be important to note
that these experiments were carried out in immune-depressed mice,
which are incompetent for antibody-induced immune responses.
No toxic effects or behavioral changes were observed at the doses
tested. Although it is possible that an antibody actively crosses the
blood-brain barrier (reviewed in ref. 19), no significant neurotoxicity
was expected in immunodepressed mice because effective blockers
of Eag1 that readily reach the brain parenchyma (e.g., imipramine)
do not exhibit massive side effects.
Earlier, we have summarized some of the features that make ion
channels especially attractive for drug targeting. The experiments
described here are a proof of principle for the use of ion-channel
specific antibodies as diagnostic and therapeutic instruments.
We have narrowed down the region within the E3 loop of ion
channels where specific antibodies can bind and inhibit channel
function. Interestingly, other antibodies binding slightly upstream
in the channel sequence were not functional. Because the sequence

similarities between the various ion channels in this area are low, it
should be possible to design specific antibodies against particular
channels. These can be used in specifically determining the roles of
each channel subtype, both in physiology and pathophysiology.
More interestingly, functional antibodies can be used to
validate Eag1 as a cancer target as in the example described
above. Unpublished experiments from our laboratory indicate that
Eag1 expression is usually not a triggering event in the process of
malignant transformation, but rather occurs later in the development of the tumor, because robust expression can be detected in
animal models in which carcinogenesis is initiated by well-defined
genetic causes. Nevertheless, Eag1 has the added advantages of
having an extraordinarily low background expression and being
very frequently detected in solid tumors. Although there is no
evidence of surface expression of the channel in actual human
clinical samples in situ, tumor models reveal that anti-Eag1
antibodies can bind to xenografted tumors in alive animals, as
shown by specific accumulation of fluorescently labeled antibody
in the tumor (20). Additionally, the antibody could be used as a
carrier for radionuclides or toxic molecules because it has proven
efficacy for other molecules. In this context, it should be possible to
design a molecule able to selectively target tumor cells and attack
them on several different fronts, functionally inhibiting Eag1 while
also delivering cytotoxic drugs (Fig. 1).
