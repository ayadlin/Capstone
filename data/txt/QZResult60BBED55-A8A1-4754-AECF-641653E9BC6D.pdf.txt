Abstract
Despite recent improvements in therapeutic management of osteosarcoma, ongoing challenges in improving
the response to chemotherapy warrants new strategies still needed to improve overall patient survival. In this
study, we investigated in vivo the effects of RAD001 (Everolimus), a new orally available mTOR inhibitor, on the
growth of human and mouse osteosarcoma cells either alone or in combination with zoledronate (ZOL), an antiosteoporotic drug used to treat bone metastases. RAD001 inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation in a doseand time-dependent manner with no modification of cell-cycle distribution. Combination with ZOL augmented
this inhibition of cell proliferation, decreasing PI3K/mTOR signaling compared with single treatments. Notably,
in contrast to RAD001, ZOL downregulated isoprenylated membrane-bound Ras concomitantly with an increase
of nonisoprenylated cytosolic Ras in sensitive and resistant osteosarcoma cell lines to both drugs. Moreover, ZOL
and RAD001 synergized to decrease Ras isoprenylation and GTP-bound Ras levels. Further, the drug combination reduced tumor development in two murine models of osteoblastic or osteolytic osteosarcoma. We found
that ZOL could reverse RAD001 resistance in osteosarcoma, limiting osteosarcoma cell growth in combination
with RAD001. Our findings rationalize further study of the applications of mTOR and mevalonate pathway
inhibitors that can limit protein prenylation pathways. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10329–39. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Current therapeutic strategies of osteosarcoma are based
on tumor resection associated with highly toxic chemotherapy
and fail to improve prognosis (1, 2) due to an absence of
response to antitumor drugs observed in many cases. Failure
of anticancer therapies often occurs from innate or/and
acquired drug resistances of tumor cells to chemotherapies
(3). In this context, therapies based on combinatorial drug
approaches (4) appear as adapted clinical strategies for

improving therapy and overcoming the multifaceted characteristics of cancer cells.
Osteoclasts are the main target in bone of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BP) including such as zoledronate
(ZOL) on which they induce apoptosis by inhibiting enzymes
of the mevalonate pathway (5–7). Thus, the most common
clinical application is osteoporosis, but bisphosphonate application has been extended to the treatment of malignant
hypercalcemia. In addition, recent in vitro studies demonstrated an antitumor activity exerted by ZOL on cancer cells
(8–10). Result of in vivo experiments also highlighted the
therapeutic interest of ZOL alone or in combination with
conventional chemotherapy on the growth of carcinoma (11)
and sarcoma (12).
mTOR plays a key role in regulating protein metabolism,
and dysregulations in mTOR signaling are frequently associated with cancer progression (13). Indeed, mTOR is a
member of the PI3K family such as ATM and ATR proteins
involved in DNA repair (14). mTOR functions encompass in 2
signaling complexes, mTORC-1 and mTORC-2, which are
sensitive to rapamycin at very different concentrations (15).
Thus, mTOR inhibition revealed its impact on cellular function and cell growth (16–19). Rapamycin and its analogues
(RAD001, CCI-779, and AP23573; ref. 13) have shown promise
in preclinical models and in clinical trials including patients
suffering from neoplastic diseases (20–26). Hougthon et al.
reported that rapamycin exerts antitumor activity in

pediatrics tumors in vitro and in vivo including osteosarcoma
(27, 28). In this context, a phase II clinical trial in patients with
advanced soft tissue or bone sarcomas revealed that AP23573
exhibits single-agent activity in patients as shown by the
prolonged overall survival (29) pointing out the pivotal role
of the mTOR pathway in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.
However, resistance to rapamycin has been identified and was
associated with a decreased binding to it, altered mTOR up- or
downstream signaling or feedback loop associated with mTOR
pathway (30).
Because RAD001 appears to be a promising agent for the
treatment of neoplastic diseases, the effects of RAD001 was
investigated on the growth of osteosarcoma cells, both alone
and in combination with ZOL. We also investigated the
mechanisms involved in the RAD001 sensitivity and resistance
of osteosarcoma cells and assessed a method to abolish
RAD001 resistance in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
The rat osteosarcoma OSRGA cell line established from a
radio-induced osteosarcoma (31) and human MG63 cells
purchased from ATCC (Promochem) were cultured in DMEM
(Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS;
Hyclone). Murine osteosarcoma POS-1 and MOS-J cells
derived from mouse spontaneous osteosarcoma were provided, respectively, by Drs. Kamijo (32) and Shultz (33) and
were cultured in RPMI with 10% FCS. Cells expressed osteoblastic markers, more specifically cbfa1/Runx2 and bone alkaline phosphatase (data not shown), and MOS-J cells were able
to form mineralized nodules in vitro (33). These parameters
were tested before cell implantation.
Cell growth and viability
Cell growth and viability were determined by XTT reagent
assay kit (Roche Molecular Biomedicals). Two thousand cells
were cultured for 72 hours in the presence or absence of
RAD001 (0.1–100 nmol/L), ZOL (0.1–100 mmol/L), or in combination of 1 or 10 nmol/L RAD001 with 1 mmol/L ZOL. ZOL
and RAD001 were provided by Pharma Novartis AG. Similar
experiments were performed in the presence or absence of
clodronate (100–300 mmol/L; Sigma), Risedronate (2–100
mmol/L; Procter&Gamble), or Manumycin A (2 or 3 mmol/
L; Sigma) combined or not with 1 nmol/L RAD001. After the
culture period and addition of XTT reagent, the absorbance
was then determined at 490 nm. Cell viability was also
assessed by Trypan blue exclusion; viable and nonviable cells
were manually counted.
Caspase activity
Twenty thousand cells were treated for 72 hours with or
without RAD001 (0.1–100 nmol/L), ZOL (0.1–100 mmol/L) or a
combination of 1 or 10 nmol/L RAD001 with 1 mmol/L ZOL.
Caspase-3 activity was assessed on 10 mL of total cell lysates
using the kit CaspACE Assay System (Promega), following the
manufacturer's recommendations. Results were expressed in
arbitrary units and corrected for protein content quantified
using the BCA test (Pierce Chemical Co.). Cells treated with

10330

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

100 nmol/L Staurosporin for 24 hours were used as a positive
control.
Time-lapse microscopy
Cells were cultured at 5  103 cells/mm2 in the presence or
absence of 10 nmol/L RAD001. Time-lapse experiments were
started just after adding the pharmaceutical agent. Phasecontrast photos were taken every 10 minutes for 72 hours
through a Leica DMI 6000B microscope using 10 objective.
Cell divisions in each field of observation were then manually
scored in a time-dependent manner. Each condition was
performed in duplicate.
Cell-cycle analysis
Subconfluent OSRGA, MG63, POS-1, or MOS-J cells were
incubated with or without 1 mmol/L ZOL and/or 1 to 10 nmol/
L of RAD001 for 24 to 72 hours. After the treatment period,
trypsinized cells were incubated in PBS containing 0.12%
Triton X-100, 0.12 mmol/L EDTA, and 100 mg/mL DNase-free
RNase A (Sigma). Then, 50 mg/mL propidium iodide were
added for 20 minutes at 4 C in the dark. Cell-cycle distribution
was studied by flow cytometry (Cytomics FC500, Beckman
Coulter)on the basis 2N and 4N DNA content, and analyzed by
DNA Cell Cycle Analysis Software (Phoenix Flow System).
Cell signaling analysis
Two hundred thousand cells were treated with 1 mmol/L
ZOL or/and 1 to 10 nmol/L RAD001 for 72 hours and then
lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (150 mmol/L
NaCl, 5% Tris, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate,
1mmol/L Na3VO4, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 10
mg/mL aprotinin). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 15 minutes. Total cell lysate (20 mg),
determined by the BCA kit, was run on 10% SDS-PAGE and
electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes
(Millipore). The membrane was blotted with antibodies to pmTOR, p-p70S6K, p-4E-BP1, p-AKT, p-PI3K, p-PTEN, actin
(Supplementary Table 1) in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 3%
bovine serum albumin. Similarly, an unprenylated form of
Rap1A was detected by Western blot to indirectly quantified
farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) activity (10). The membrane was washed and probed with the secondary antibody
that was coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Antibody binding
was visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system
(Roche Molecular Biomedicals). For quantification, the
emitted glow was acquired with a CCD camera and analyzed
with the GeneTools program (Syngene).
Ras isoprenylation and GTP-binding activity
To measure isoprenylated membrane-bound Ras and nonisoprenylated cytosolic Ras, cells were lysed in 1 mL of lysis
buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES; 750 mmol/L KCl; 200 mmol/L
sucrose; 10 mmol/L NaHCO3, pH 7.4), supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail set III (100 mmol/L AEBSF,
80 mmol/L aprotinin, 5 mmol/L bestatin, 1.5 mmol/L E- 64,
2 mmol/L leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L pepstatin; Calbiochem),
1 mmol/L NaVO4, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L 4-(2-aminoethyl)

10 mmol/L dithiothreitol), then sonicated (Labsonic sonicator)
and centrifuged at 13,000  g for 5 minutes at 4 C. Supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 100,000  g for 1 hour
at 4 C; the cytosolic fraction in the new supernatant was
collected, whereas the pellets (membrane fraction) were resuspended in 100 mL of lysis buffer. Cytosolic fraction (30 mg) and
membrane fraction (60 mg) were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE
and Western blot analysis, using an anti-Ras antibody (Supplementary data 1). The Ras-GTP binding assay was performed
as previously described (34). Briefly, cells were lysed in MLB
buffer (125 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 750 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
NP40, 10% glycerol, 50 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 25
mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L NaVO4, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 10 mg/mL
pepstatin, 10 mg/mL aprotinin and 1 mmol/L PMSF) and
centrifuged at 13,000  g for 10 minutes at 4 C. An aliquot
of supernatant was taken out for determination of protein
content (BCA kit). Cell lysate (30 mg) was incubated for 45
minutes at 4 C with the Ras Assay Reagent (Raf-1 RBD, GSTtagged Agarose beads; Millipore), then the beads were washed
and resuspended in 20 mL Laemmli buffer (125 mmol/L Tris, 4%
w/v SDS, 20% v/v glycerol, and 1% b-mercaptoethanol). The
amount of active GTP-bound Ras was detected by SDS-PAGE
and Western blotting as reported earlier.
In vivo experiments
Mice (Elevages Janvier) were housed under pathogen-free
conditions at the Experimental Therapy Unit (Faculty of
Medicine, Nantes) in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the French Ethical Committee and under the supervision of authorized investigators.
Osteoblastic osteosarcoma model. Four-week-old male
C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized by inhalation of a combination Isoflurane/air associated with an intramuscular injection
of Buprenorphine (Temgesic, Schering-Plough) before intramuscular injection of 2  106 MOS-J cells. Tumors appeared in
contact with the tibia approximately 8 days later and lead to
osteoblastic lesions reproducing the osteoblastic form of
human osteosarcoma (33).
Osteolytic osteosarcoma model. Four-week-old male
C3H/He mice were anesthetized as previously described
before subcutaneous inoculation of POS-1 cell suspension
(containing 2  106 cells) in the hind footpad of the mice.
Under these conditions, mice develop a primary tumor at the
site of injection in 3 weeks that can be transplanted to mice of
the same strain as a small fragment (2  2  2 mm3) in close
contact with the tibia. For this purpose, the periostum of the
diaphysis was opened and resected along a length of 5 mm,
and the underlying bone was intact. The osteosarcoma fragment was placed contiguous to the exposed bone surface
without the periostum, and the cutaneous and muscular
wounds were sutured. Tumors appeared at the graft site
approximately 8 days later associated with the development
of pulmonary metastases in a 3-week period. The tumors that
develop in contact to the femora lead to osteolytic lesions that
reproduce the osteolytic form of human osteosarcoma (35).
For both models, the tumor volumes (V) were calculated from
the measurement of 2 perpendicular diameters using a caliper
according to the following formula: V ¼ 0.5  L  S2, where L and

www.aacrjournals.org

S represent the largest and smallest perpendicular tumor diameters, respectively. Four groups of 8 mice each were assigned
as controls (placebo by oral administration and PBS injection
subcutaneously twice a week), RAD001 (5 mg/kg, oral administration, twice a week), ZOL (100 mg/kg, subcutaneously, twice a
week) and RAD001 þ ZOL (combined treatment with subcutaneous 100 mg/kg ZOL and 5 mg/kg RAD001 oral administration, twice weekly) groups. The treatment started 1 day after
tumor cell implantation. Treatment continued until each animal
showed signs of morbidity including cachexia or respiratory
distress, at which point they were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Analysis of architectural parameters was done using highresolution X-ray micro–computed tomography (CT; SkyScan1072). Relative volume (BV/TV) of the tibia [total bone (cortical
þ trabecular) or trabecular bone] was quantified at necropsy on
a 6.4-cm-length area located between superior metaphysis and
diaphysis. Radiographs were taken at the same time (PLANMED
Sophie apparatus). Each experiment was repeated twice and
only 1 set of experiments was shown.
Statistical analysis
Each experiment was repeated independently 3 times. The
mean  SD was calculated for all conditions and compared by
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. Differences
relative to a probability of 2-tailed P < 0.05 were considered
significant.

Results
RAD001 exerts a cytostatic activity on osteosarcoma
cells and synergizes with N-BP in vitro
RAD001 significantly reduced MG63, OSRGA, and POS-1
osteosarcoma cell number in a dose-dependent manner (P <
0.01;IC50: 0.5 nmol/L, 1.26 nmol/L, and 45 nmol/L for OSRGA,
MG63, and POS-1 cells, respectively) with a maximum effect at
100 nmol/L (concentrations tested up to 1 mmol/L; Fig. 1A).
ZOL strongly diminished the number of MG63, OSRGA, and
POS-1 cells assessed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B).
Manual counting of viable cells did not evidence cell death in
any condition tested, as confirmed by the absence of caspase
activity in (data not shown). Time-lapse microscopy revealed
that 10 nmol/L RAD001 clearly induced a marked decrease of
mitotis in MG63, OSRGA, and POS-1 osteosarcoma cells
detectable at early times of the treatment (6–11 hours;
Fig. 1C). Moreover, osteosarcoma cells treated with RAD001
were not blocked in any phase of the cell cycle, but the cancer
cells passed through the different phases at a slightly inferior
rate than the untreated control (data not shown). These data
demonstrate that RAD001, therefore, can be considered a
cytostatic drug for osteosarcoma.
Figure 2 clearly shows a significant additive effect between
RAD001 and ZOL for MG63, OSRGA, and POS-1 cells (Fig. 2A;
P < 0.001). In contrast to the combination RAD001 and
risedronate (another N-BP), which induced similar combinatory effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 2B, P < 0.001),
clodronate (a non–N-BP, 100–500 mmol/L) did not significantly modulate RAD001 activity. This combinatory effect
between RAD001 and ZOL was confirmed by Western blot

analysis (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Figure 2). In contrast to
treatment with 1 nmol/L RAD001, which had no effect on the
mTOR signaling pathway, 10 nmol/L RAD001 significantly
inhibited the mTOR signaling pathway in POS-1 and OSRGA
cells, as revealed by a decrease of mTOR phosphorylation,
but not in MG63 osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 2C). ZOL (1 mmol/
L) did not affect mTOR signaling (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the
combination of 10 nmol/L RAD001 and 1 mmol/L ZOL totally
abolished P-mTOR and drastically inhibited its main downstream signaling partners, demonstrating a cross talk
between ZOL and mTOR signaling pathways in all MG63,
OSRGA, and POS-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Treatment of cells with 1
mmol/L ZOL did not alter unRAP1A expression, as did
treatment with higher doses (data not shown, 10). Furthermore, the combination of RAD001 with ZOL strongly
reduced P-PI3K, downregulated the phosphorylation of
PTEN in MG63, OSRGA, and POS-1 cells and also altered
AKT phosphorylation in POS-1 cells (Fig. 2C). Consequently,
this combination dysregulated the mTOR downstream signaling and decreased the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in the 3
cell lines assessed (Fig. 2C). p70S6K was decreased in MG63
and OSRGA and slightly in POS-1 cells (Fig. 2C).
Combined treatment with RAD001 and ZOL is efficient
on RAD001-resistant osteosarcoma cells in vitro
Mouse osteosarcoma MOS-J is totally refractory to RAD001
(up to 1 mmol/L tested) and ZOL (up to 10 mmol/L, 100 mmol/L
being cytotoxic; Fig. 3A). Interestingly, combination of RAD

10332

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

and ZOL at low doses induced a synergistic antiproliferative
effect on MOS-J cells (Fig. 3B, P < 0.001). The biological activity
of RAD001 in MOS-J cells was demonstrated by Western blot
analyses. Indeed, 10 nmol/L RAD001 decreased the phosphorylation of PI3K, PTEN, Akt, mTOR, P-4EBP1, and P-p70S6K
(Fig. 3C) without any effect on MOS-J cell proliferation
(Fig. 3B). Although ZOL alone did not also modulate these
activities, ZOL and RAD001 exert an additive effect to strongly
inhibit mTOR signaling (Fig. 3C).
Ras-prenylation is strongly decreased by the combined
treatment with RAD001 and ZOL
Ras is located at the crossroads between ZOL and mTOR
signaling pathways. Indeed, ZOL is a powerful inhibitor of
FPPS activity implicated in the prenylation of small GTPases
(7, 13), and the PI3K/mTOR pathway belongs to the downstream cascades of Ras activation. In this context, we first
analyzed the effects of the ZOL and RAD001 combination on
Ras isoprenylation (Fig. 4). ZOL (1 mmol/L) induced a significant decrease of isoprenylated membrane-bound Ras and a
concomitant increase of nonisoprenylated cytosolic Ras in all
osteosarcoma cell lines tested, in contrast to 1 or 10 nmol/L
RAD001, which had no effect on Ras isoprenylation (Fig. 4A).
The combined treatment of RAD001 with ZOL induced a
marked decrease of Ras isoprenylation (Fig. 4A). Simultaneously, this combination reduced Ras bound to GTP
(Fig. 4A). To determine the role of Ras activity in the additive
effect of RAD001 and ZOL, the effect of Manumycin A, an

cell proliferation in combination with RAD001 (Fig. 4B). In all
osteosarcoma cell lines tested (sensitive and resistant to
RAD001), Manumycin A and RAD001 exert an additive effect
in inhibiting cell proliferation, thus mimicking ZOL activity
(Fig. 4B, P < 0.001).

models
Preliminary dose–response experiments were carried out in
vivo to determine the sub-optimal efficient doses of RAD001
and ZOL (data not shown). The ZOL dose (100 mg/kg ZOL as
research grade disodium salt) used in this study is equivalent

to the intravenous clinical dose of 4 mg every 3 to 4 weeks.
However, even if dosing frequency of twice a week is greater,
these doses are justified by the very aggressive nature of the
osteosarcoma models used and the short animal survival. Both
drugs did not exert any side effects on animal body weight loss
or any toxic effects in MOS-J and POS-1 osteosarcoma models.
The in vivo effects of single or combinatory treatment on
tumor growth were first studied in a MOS-J osteosarcoma
model, cells that are resistant to both agents in vitro. Doses of 5
mg/kg RAD001 or 100 mg/kg ZOL were chosen for the subsequent combination experiments because they had no significant effect alone on tumor growth, as compared with the
control group (Fig. 5A and B). RAD001 and ZOL combination
reduced the tumor volume compared with single treatment

(Fig. 5A, P < 0.001). The relative tumor progression calculated
between day 19 and day 31 confirmed the synergistic action
between RAD001 and ZOL (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, combined
treatment of RAD001 and ZOL significantly slowed down the
tumor progression compared with a single treatment and to
the control group (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, radiographs revealed
that 100 mg/kg ZOL strongly reduced bone degradation
(Fig. 5C) even if it had no effect on the tumor progression
(Fig. 5A, Fig. 5B). Indeed, the metaphyses of long bones
exhibited high bone density reflecting inhibition of bone
resorption and retention of the primary spongiosa in contrast
to 5 mg/kg RAD001, which had no protective effect of bone
loss (Fig. 5C). The combination of RAD001 with ZOL had no
additive inhibitory effect of bone resorption as compared with
ZOL alone. By combining micro-CT image registration, the
bone remodeling associated with osteosarcoma development
has been followed and confirmed the radiographic analysis
(Fig. 5D). ZOL (100 mg/kg) and 100 mg/kg ZOL þ 5 mg/kg
RAD001 significantly increased bone mass in contrast to 5 mg/
kg RAD001 alone. This was confirmed by the quantification of
relative bone volume (BV/TV). Indeed, BV/TV increased by
approximately 40% in the presence of ZOL and ZOL þ RAD001
compared with the control group (Fig. 5D, P < 0.001). RAD001
and ZOL induce additive effects on tumor development and
reduce the growth of resistant MOS-J osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells in syngeneic mice. Histologic analyses demon-

strated that the residual bone mass of animals treated with
the combination of 100 mg/kg of ZOL and 5 mg/kg RAD001
was mainly composed of an extensive fibrosis associated with
nontumorigenic cells and with extensive necrotic foci compared with the other groups (Supplementary Figure 3). These
nontumorigenic cells, which were nonresponding cells to the
treatment used and the necrotic tissue, did not allow a
complete in vivo analysis of the phosphorylation status of
mTOR pharmacodynamic markers such as p70S6k and 4EBP1.
Similar experiments were carried out using an osteolyticPOS-1 osteosarcoma model (35). RAD001 (5 mg/kg) had no
effect on POS-1 tumor growth compared with the control
group (Fig. 6B). ZOL slightly but not significantly reduced the
tumor volume (Fig. 6A, Fig. 5B) but markedly decreased bone
degradation as shown by an increase of bone mineral density
of the metaphysis (Fig. 6C). On the contrary, 5 mg/kg RAD001
alone had no effect on tumor-induced osteolysis, and the
combination of RAD001 with ZOL had no additive inhibitory
effect of bone resorption as compared with ZOL alone
(Fig. 6C). Interestingly, RAD001 and ZOL in combination
significantly decreased the tumor volume compared with
the control, and with single treatments (Fig. 6A). Such combination treatment slowed down the tumor progression
(Fig. 6B, P < 0.001). Micro-CT analysis confirmed the
significant impact of ZOL on osteolysis with an increase in
BV/TV (Fig. 6D). The combinatory treatment clearly improved

Discussion
The absence of response of patients suffering from osteosarcoma to chemotherapy and the lack of effectiveness of
single-drug therapy led to the development of new therapeutic
approaches. Indeed, therapy based on combinatorial drug
regimens targeting different metabolic pathways would prevent the emergence of resistance phenomena and increase the
effectiveness of treatment while reducing toxicity for patients
(36). Dysregulation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, mainly due to
redundant autocrine pathways rather than mutations, is
clearly involved in the pathogenesis of sarcomas. mTOR is

www.aacrjournals.org

a central crossroads of many signaling pathways induced by
growth factors and nutritional status, and this crossroad is
deregulated in numerous cancer cells (36). It directly and
indirectly controls many cellular events such as translation,
transcription and protein stability, and regulates cell growth,
proliferation, survival, and cell size (37). In this context, its
functions have positioned mTOR as a potential target for
cancer therapy and have stimulated the development of
selective inhibitors of mTOR complexes (13). mTOR inhibitors
have been already assessed in numerous malignancies (20) but
only few data have been published on osteosarcoma.
The present work demonstrates the therapeutic interest of
a rapamycin analogue, RAD001. RAD001 slowed down
cell-cycle phases in all osteosarcoma cell lines studied, but
in absence of a cell-cycle arrest or increase of cell death, this

effect may be explained by the role exerted by mTOR on
protein synthesis. Indeed, protein synthesis is regulated by
mTOR complex 1 (composed by mTOR, regulatory associated
protein of mTOR, and G-protein subunit-like), which phosphorylates several substrates including ribosomal S6 kinase
(S6K) and the eukaryote initiation factor 4E binding protein-1
(4EBP-1; ref. 38). Once activated, S6K phosphorylates the
ribosomal protein S6, resulting in the translation of a subset
of mRNAs encoding for essential ribosome proteins, including
eukaryotic initiation factor-4B and increasing translation
mechanisms. Similar to other immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic agents, adverse events related to RAD001 are
frequent and lead to moderate dropout rates (39). Interestingly, the combination of RAD001 and ZOL clearly synergized
to slow down cell proliferation in all osteosarcoma cells
studied, with a marked downregulation of mTOR, 4EBP1,
and p70S6K phosphorylation. Thus, this combination may
be used to limit the side effects of high drug doses. mTOR
signaling is controlled by an upstream signal including PI3K,
Akt activation (directly on mTOR or indirectly via TSC1/TSC2
complex) and complex feedback inhibitions. Such feedback

10336

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

loops could explain that mTOR inhibition induces upstream
receptor tyrosine kinase signaling activating Akt as observed
in human breast and prostate carcinoma cells (40), and in
OSRGA and MG63 osteosarcoma cells.
Unfortunately, resistance phenomena to rapamycin have
been described (41). This is the case for mouse osteosarcoma
cells used in this study, which are resistant to RAD001 and
rapamycin (data not shown). In vitro experiments point out
the additive effect between ZOL and RAD001 as revealed by
the downregulation of mTOR downstream signaling (4EBP1,
p70S6K) in RAD001-sentitive and -resistant osteosarcoma
cells. ZOL strongly affects the mechanism of prenylation of
small GTAPases leading to its inhibition (refs. 7, 13; Fig. 7).
Indeed, farnesyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate are required for the posttranslational lipid modification (prenylation) of small GTPases (i.e., Ras, Rho, and Rac).
Among small GTPases, Ras activates the PI3K/mTOR
cascade and like mTOR, it plays a central role in the
regulation of various cellular processes. However, Ras bound
to GTP is able to interact strongly with PI3K (42, 43). In the
present work, low doses of ZOL alone or combined with

RAD001 decreased the isoprenylated-membrane bound form
of Ras and increased the nonisoprenylated cytosolic Ras
leading to the decrease of Ras bound to GTP and to the
inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. These data
were confirmed by the use of manumycin A, which
mimicked ZOL activity, clearly evidencing the involvement
of Ras (Fig. 7). However, if Ras is potentially involved in the
additive activity between ZOL and RAD001, the alterations
of other prenylated proteins can be excluded.
The additive effect of ZOL and RAD001 was confirmed in 2
different murine osteosarcoma models. Combination of ZOL
with RAD001 resulted in a significant downregulation of
tumor progression associated with an increase of bone mass.
However, no additive effect on bone the inhibition of bone
resorption was evident in histomorphometric analysis confirming that ZOL potentiates RAD001 activity and not the
contrary. ZOL also contributed to the decrease of tumor
mass by inhibiting osteolysis. The interactions between
tumor cells, tumor factors and the bone marrow microenvironment are crucial for the initiation and promotion of
skeletal malignancies. These observations suggest a vicious

cycle driving the formation of osteolytic bone tumors: tumor
cells secrete soluble factors in bone (such as hormones,
cytokines, and growth factors), which stimulate osteoclastic
bone resorption through indirect RANKL production by
osteoblastic stromal cells (44). The osteosarcoma models
used in the present work are very aggressive and did not
allow the investigation of curative treatments using critical
tumor volumes. Indeed, at the critical tumor size approximately 200 to 300 mm3, the bone erosion has been already set
up especially for the POS-1 model and the therapeutic benefit
could not be gained by starting the treatment later. In this
context, the combined treatment with ZOL and RAD001
appears potentially interesting for patients who have been
diagnosed at early stages of their disease.
Overall, these data provide new insights in the molecular
cross talk between mTOR and the mevalonate pathway and
underline the therapeutic interest of multidrug treatment
combining nitrogen bisphosphonate and mTOR inhibitors in
osteosarcoma. The significance of this combination opens new
areas in the field of therapeutic multidrug strategies for the
treatment of primary bone tumors, especially in osteosarcoma.
