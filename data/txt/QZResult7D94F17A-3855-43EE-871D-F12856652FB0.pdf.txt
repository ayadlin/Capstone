BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of chemotherapy-associated cardiac
toxicity, including cardiac dysrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease,
and conduction disorders among breast cancer patients with up to 16 years of follow-up. METHODS: The
authors studied 19,478 women aged >65 diagnosed with breast cancer in 1991-1997 from 16 regions in the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Incidence density and cumulative incidence of cardiac toxicities were calculated, and the time-to-event (cardiac toxicity) analysis was conducted by using
the Cox hazard regression model. RESULTS: The excess cumulative incidence of congestive heart failure in
Year 10 among patients receiving anthracycline-containing chemotherapy compared with patients without
chemotherapy was 4.7% (31.9% vs 27.2%). After adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics, patients
receiving anthracyclines were 25% more likely to have congestive heart failure compared with those without chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.46). Those receiving other
agents did not have a significantly elevated risk of developing congestive heart failure. The adjusted risk of
cardiomyopathy was 2-fold higher in women who received anthracyclines (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.44-2.62) and
was 16% higher in those receiving other agents (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.97-1.39) compared with those without
chemotherapy. The increased risk for developing congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac dysrhythmias in association with chemotherapy were similar after adjusting for hypertension and diabetes. The
risk of ischemic heart disease and conduction disorders were not significantly different among the 3
groups. CONCLUSIONS: Anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens were associated with an
increased risk of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac dysrhythmias, but not significantly

Cardiac Toxicity and Chemotherapy/Du et al

For example, anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy has been among the most active agents in treating
breast cancer and has been beneficial in improving the disease-free and overall survival over the past 2 decades.1
Such trials prospectively collect the most comprehensive
and systematic data on adverse events in a monitored setting. In fact, the toxicity profiles of various drugs are often
established under such ‘‘ideal world’’ conditions in premarketing clinical trials before approval by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).2 This process is particularly true for reporting side effects associated with administration of systemic chemotherapy.3-15 However, clinical
trials generally have rigid eligibility criteria, often excluding elderly patients, pregnant women, patients with
multiple coexisting diseases, and those taking medications
suspected of interacting with the study drug.16,17 Therefore, study participants (motivated volunteers) in clinical
trials often represent a much more homogeneous patient
population in terms of gender, age, race/ethnicity, and
comorbidity, and they are not representative of the population at large, particularly the elderly population who are
often substantially underrepresented in clinical trials.16
Furthermore, clinical trials may not have adequate statistical power to detect rare events or have sufficient follow-up
to identify long-term toxicities. Hence, the current system
of postmarketing surveillance of long-term toxicities
requires substantial improvement.17-30 One approach to
obtaining more complete information on drug toxicity is
to supplement data from premarketing clinical trials with
data from postmarketing drug surveillance to produce
better estimates. However, there is a paucity of information on cancer chemotherapy-related toxicities from
population-based studies.31,32
Several reports have been published on chemotherapy-associated cardiac complications, particularly anthracycline-containing agents that are known to be associated
with a range of cardiotoxic syndromes.11-13 Cardiotoxicity may occur either immediately at the time of drug
administration or months to years after treatment. Two
studies recently examined the incidence of congestive
heart failure associated with chemotherapy for breast
cancer and found a 14% to 35% increase in risks for those
receiving chemotherapy.31,32 The objectives of the current
analysis were to extend the scope of these studies: 1) to
determine the anthracycline-related risk of a wider range
of cardiac disorders, including cardiac dysrhythmia,
Cancer

cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart
disease, and conduction disorders; 2) to determine a more
accurate estimate of chemotherapy-associated cardiac
toxicity by restricting the study cohort to those without
preexisting cardiac disease; and 3) to examine patients
with long-term follow-up extending up to 16 years to
identify late cardiac toxicities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
This study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database for Medicare
beneficiaries diagnosed with breast cancer. The SEER
program, supported by the National Cancer Institute,
includes population-based tumor registries in selected
geographic areas in 1991-1997: San Francisco/Oakland,
Detroit, Seattle, Atlanta, Rural Georgia, Los Angeles
county, the San Jose–Monterey area; and the states of
Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, and Hawaii,
covering >14% of the US population.32 The Medicare
program provides payments for hospital, physician and
outpatient medical services for >97% of persons aged
65. The University of Texas Health Science Center at
Houston Committee for the Protection of Human
Subjects approved this study.

Study Population
The study population comprised 32,004 women diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) stages I-IV breast cancer as the only primary
tumor at age 65 years in 1991-1997, who had full coverage of Medicare Parts A and B, and were not enrolled with
Health Maintenance Organizations from the year of diagnosis to the last follow-up (December 2005 or date of
death). We studied patients from only 1991-1997 to
examine the long-term risk of cardiac toxicity associated
with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and to minimize
the potential impact or confounding of trastuzumab that
was a new agent since 1998, which was reported to be
associated with an increased risk of cardiac toxicity. For
the purpose of this study in determining the relation
between chemotherapy and cardiotoxicities, we included
patients who were free of cardiovascular diseases at the
5297

time of cancer diagnosis, specifically congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmias, conduction
disorders, and ischemic heart disease. By doing so, we
excluded 11,489 cases with preexisting cardiac diseases,
808 cases who received first chemotherapy after 12
months of diagnosis, and 229 cases with mitoxanthrone,
leaving 19,478 subjects for the final analysis.
Variables
Outcome Variables on Cardiac-Toxicities

Patients were defined to have been diagnosed with
cardiac diseases when there were at least 2 claims from the
ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes34 with >30 days apart after
the date of breast cancer diagnosis: congestive heart failure
(diagnosis code, 428.x), cardiomyopathy (diagnosis code,
425.x), cardiac dysrhythmia (diagnosis code, 427.x), conduction disorder (diagnosis code, 426.x), and ischemic
heart disease (diagnosis codes, 410.x, 411.x, 412.x, 413.x,
or 414.x). The time in days was calculated from the date
of diagnosis to the date of the first claim for cardiac
condition.
Chemotherapy and Other Treatments

Patients were defined as having received chemotherapy if any of the following procedure codes for chemotherapy were present in the inpatient, physician, or
outpatient claims within 12 months of breast cancer diagnosis35: the ICD-9-CM procedure code of 9925 and V
codes of V58.1, V66.2, or V67.2; the Common Procedure Terminology codes of 96,400-96,549, J8510,
J8520, J8521, J8530-J8999, J9000-J9999 and Q0083Q0085; and revenue center codes of 0331, 0332, and
0335. Of these patients, those who received anthracycline-containing regimens were defined when there were
claims for doxorubicin (J9000, J9001, or J9010). A small
number of 229 subjects with mitoxanthrone (J9293) were
not included in the study cohort. Thus, patients were classified into 3 mutually exclusive groups: 1) anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy (n ¼ 1104); 2) nonanthracycline chemotherapy (n ¼ 3398); or 3) no-chemotherapy
(n ¼ 14,986). Breast-conserving surgery, or mastectomy,
or radiation therapy36 were defined previously.
Socioeconomic Status

The percentage of persons living below the poverty
line at the census tract level from the 1990 census for cases
5298

between 1991 and 1997 was used to define the socioeconomic status (SES). These percentages were classified into
quartiles: 3.62%, 3.63%-6.62%, 6.63%-11.99%, and
12.00% (poorest SES).
Comorbidity Index

Comorbidity was ascertained from Medicare claims
by identifying comorbid conditions between 1 year before
and 1 month after the diagnosis of breast cancer, including diabetes, liver disease, and dementia, but excluding
any malignant tumors. Detailed methods for creating a
weighted comorbidity score have been previously
reported.37

Analysis
Differences in the distribution of baseline characteristics
among the 3 chemotherapy groups were tested using the
chi-square statistic. Incidence rate (density) was defined as
the ratio of the number of new cardiac disorders over the
total person-years. Person-years were calculated as the
number of patients multiplied by the number of years
from diagnosis to the date of the first cardiac toxicity, date
of death, or date of last follow-up, whichever occurred
first. The cumulative incidence (probability) of cardiotoxicity was calculated using the statistical program by Penman and Johnson.38 The Cox hazard regression model
was used to perform the time-to-event (toxicity) analysis
by using the PHREG procedure available in SAS (Cary,
NC: SAS System).

RESULTS
Table 1 presents the distribution of baseline characteristics
among the 3 groups of patients stratified by chemotherapy
status. Of the 19,478 patients with breast cancer at ages
65-89 years in 1991-1997, 5.7% received anthracyclinebased chemotherapy, 17.4% received other chemotherapy
agents (of which 45.6% were flurouracil and 9.6% were
taxanes), and 76.9% did not receive chemotherapy. A
higher proportion of younger or married women received
chemotherapy; 50.5% of patients aged 65-69 years
received anthracycline-based chemotherapy, 36.3%
received other chemotherapy, and 23.9% received no
chemotherapy. A slightly lower percentage of Caucasians
received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. There were

no significant differences in distribution across the quartiles of SES. A higher percentage of patients with earlier
stage disease, small tumor size, fewer positive lymph
nodes, well-differentiated tumors, and positive hormone
receptor status did not receive chemotherapy. Patients
with no comorbidities were more likely to receive chemotherapy. A higher proportion of women with bilateral
breast cancer and bilateral mastectomies and those in
recent years received anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
There was no claim for epirubicin (J9178) in these
patients.
Table 2 presents the incidence rate (density) of cardiac toxicities stratified by chemotherapy status and age.
For example, the incidence of congestive heart failure in
patients aged 65-69 years who received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy was 33.2 per 10,000 person years,
compared with 22.3 for those receiving nonanthracycline
chemotherapy and 18.5 for those not receiving chemotherapy. Overall, incidence rates increased with advanced
5300

age for all 5 cardiac conditions. Incidence rates of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac dysrhythmia were generally the highest in patients receiving
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy, and the lowest
in those without chemotherapy except among the oldest
old patients (aged 85-89 years). This is in contrast to the
incidence rates of ischemic heart disease and conduction
disorders, which did not strongly correlate with chemotherapy status.
Table 3 presents the cumulative incidence (probability) of congestive heart failure over the 15-year period and
was stratified into 3 groups according to chemotherapy
status. The incidence probability was 3.1% in Year 1 for
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and 1.5% for
other chemotherapy compared with 1.6% for the no
chemotherapy group. Cumulative incidence in Year 10
was 31.9%, 26.4%, and 27.2%, respectively, for the
above-mentioned 3 groups, indicating that the excess incidence was 4.7% among patients receiving anthracyclineCancer

Cumulative incidence for congestive heart failure and
other 4 cardiac conditions was presented in Figure 1. For
example, cumulative incidence curves for congestive heart
failure and cardiomyopathy were notably different among
the 3 groups with the highest incidence rate in patients
receiving anthracyclines and lowest in those without
chemotherapy, whereas the incidence curves were not
much different for other cardiac conditions among the 3
groups. By Year 10 of follow-up, the number at risk for
congestive heart failure was 246 (22.2% of the baseline)
for anthracyclines group, 1261 (37.2%) for other chemotherapy group, and 6094 (40.7) for no-chemotherapy

Table 4 presents the multivariate time-to-event (toxicity) analysis for the relative risk (hazard ratio) of developing various types of cardiac conditions. Patients treated
with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy were 25%
significantly more likely to develop congestive heart failure compared with those without chemotherapy, after
adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics (HR, 1.25;
95% CI,1.07-1.46). Those receiving other chemotherapy
did not have a significantly elevated risk of developing
congestive heart failure. The adjusted risk of developing
cardiomyopathy was twice as likely in women with
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (HR, 1.95; 95%
CI, 1.44-2.62) and was 16% higher in those treated with

and 12% more likely to develop ischemic heart disease,
but they had no significant elevated risk of developing cardiomyopathy and conduction disorders.
Table 5 presents the risk of cardiac toxicity in association with the number of chemotherapy claims as a proxy
measure for the number of chemotherapy cycles, stratified
by tumor stage. In those with stage I-IIIA, patients receiving 5 to 9 doses and 10 doses of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy were more likely to develop congestive
heart failure compared with those without chemotherapy
but with wide confidence intervals due to small numbers
after stratification (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.99-2.38, and
HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.88-1.67, respectively). In those with
advanced stage disease (IIIB-IV) or unstaged, patients
receiving 10 doses of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy were 37% more likely to develop congestive heart
failure (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.80-2.34). Patients receiving

only 1 to 4 doses of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy or other chemotherapy had slightly elevated but nonsignificant risk of congestive heart failure in patients with
late stage. There was also a strong dose-response relation
between the receipt of anthracyclines and the risk of developing cardiomyopathy. Higher doses of anthracyclines
were also associated with slightly elevated risks of cardiac
dysrhythmia and ischemic heart disease, but not with conduction disorders.

DISCUSSION
The potential long-term cardiac risk that results from
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy is relatively wellstudied in children,39 but it is less well-studied in adult
patients with cancer, particularly in the elderly population. Our study sought to examine whether anthracyclinebased or nonanthracycline-based chemotherapy is

associated with the increased risk of dysrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, and conduction disorders, in addition
to congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy. The overview of the 194 randomized trials of adjuvant chemotherapy with up to 15 years of follow-up by the Early Breast
Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group1 reported that the
relative risk of death from heart disease was 1.33 in
women receiving anthracycline-based versus nonanthracycline-based chemotherapy. However, this overview did
not report the incidence of heart disease and did not differentiate between the various types of heart disease. Our
study showed a relative risk (HR, 1.25) for the incidence
of congestive heart failure in patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy compared with those without
chemotherapy in 1991-1997 with up to 16 years of
follow-up. Also, our study showed an excess risk of incidence of 4.7% in patients receiving anthracyclines comCancer

pared with those without chemotherapy, whereas there
was a survival advantage of 4.2% in patients receiving
anthracyclines as reported in the above overview of clinical
trials.1 This is consistent with the current literature illustrating that anthracyclines prolong survival while carrying
a risk of cardiac toxicitiy.40-45
A recent study of 1176 patients from the Southwest
Oncology Trial40 concluded that exposure to doxorubicin
did not increase the risk of adverse cardiac effects (specifically deterioration in left ventricular ejection fraction).
However, although left ventricular ejection fraction is a
marker for advanced myocyte damage, approximately half
of all heart failure diagnosed in the United States occurs
in patients who maintain a normal left ventricular ejection
fraction.41 Therefore, the association between anthracycline use and risk of late heart failure could be underestimated if the estimate is based on left ventricular ejection

fraction alone. A notable finding from our study is that
the risk of cardiac toxicity had a dose-response relation
with chemotherapy particularly among those patients
who received 10 or more doses of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. The above-mentioned findings remain
similar after controlling for preexisting hypertension and
diabetes. Conversely, there were no significant associations between the risk of ischemic heart disease and conduction disorder and the use of anthracycline-containing
chemotherapy.
This study possesses several strengths. First, Medicare claims cover all medical services provided, including
inpatient hospitalization, outpatient clinics, and physician
office visits, regardless of where patients sought medical
care in the United States, thus ensuring more comprehensive information on treatment and associated medical
conditions. Second, a large retrospective cohort of breast
cancer patients had been followed up for up to 16 years,
allowing for more adequate assessment of long-term or
late toxicities that may be associated with chemotherapy
administration. Third, SEER-Medicare data not only
provide well-validated pathologic information on tumor
characteristics (stage and histology) at diagnosis but also
allow for the examination of socioeconomic factors. Furthermore, comorbid conditions can be identified from
Medicare data. Because comorbidity is a known confounder for treatment and cardiac conditions, controlling
for comorbidity becomes critical in minimizing residual
confounding when addressing the cardiac risk associated
with chemotherapy.
It is important to note some limitations of this
study. First, Medicare claims have limited information on
the dose and intensity of chemotherapy administered that
could have affected the occurrence and severity of cardiac
toxicities. This study relied on common procedure codes
that specified standard dose for each chemotherapy agent;
but, in practice, physicians may have modified a standard
chemotherapy dose for an individual patient according to
preexisting medical conditions or tolerability. Furthermore, we used the number of chemotherapy claims as a
proxy measure for the number of cycles of chemotherapy
administered. Although this study demonstrated an interesting dose-response relationship between number of
cycles of chemotherapy and the risk of developing cardiac
toxicity, which is consistent with clinical trial reports, the
estimates could potentially be diluted because of the lack
5306

of ‘‘true’’ cycles and doses that can be obtained in closely
monitored trials. Third, although Medicare claims on
overall chemotherapy administration have been externally
validated, the validity of claims on cardiac disorders has
not been well-studied. There may also be potential surveillance bias in ascertaining the cardiac outcomes. For
example, patients after receiving anthracyclines may be
more likely to see their physicians for check-ups and
more likely to be labeled as having congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy, leading to differential misclassification bias. Conversely, some patients may have had
preexisting cardiomyopathy or low left ventricular ejection fraction, but they may not be labeled as suffering
from this condition, leading to nondifferential misclassification bias. There may also be potential selection bias
when physicians make decisions on the prescription of
chemotherapy based on individual’s cardiac function or
performance status. Although we excluded those with
history of cardiovascular diseases, some unmeasured preclinical symptoms that are related with heart disease
could potentially lead to selection bias. Also, the number
of patients was large at baseline, but after more than 10
years of follow-up, the number of patients became
smaller, which could affect the stability of incidence estimates. In addition, if patients had private medical services with claims that were not filed with Medicare for
reimbursement, these data might be missed, thus leading
to bias toward diluting the exposure-outcomes association. Furthermore, this study did not address physician
or hospital characteristics that might be associated with
selection of chemotherapy and intensity of surveillance
for monitoring patients.
In conclusion, anthracycline-containing chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of developing
congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac dysrhythmias, but it was not significantly associated with the
development of ischemic heart disease and conduction
disorders. Other (nonanthracycline) chemotherapy agents
were not significantly associated with an increased risk of
congestive heart failure and conduction disorders, but
they were associated with a slightly elevated risk of cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias, and ischemic heart disease.
