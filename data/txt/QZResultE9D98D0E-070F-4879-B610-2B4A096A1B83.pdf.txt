ABSTRACT
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted strategy is limited by
resistance. We identify the potential genes involved in EGFR TKI (tyrosine kinase
inhibitor) resistance and study the therapeutic mechanism in the non-small cell lung
cancers. Potential genes involved in resistance were examined by analyzing datasets
from a pair of EGFR TKI-sensitive (PC9) and TKI-resistant cells (PC9/gef). Blood
specimens from patients taking EGFR TKI as first-line treatment were used to examine
the correlation between drug’s efficacy and IL-8 level. The effects of IL-8 on gefitinibinduced apoptosis, stemness, and in vivo tumorigenicity were investigated using
established cell lines. We identified IL-8 was up-regulated in gefitinib-resistant cells,
and high plasma IL-8 level was correlated with shorter progression-free-survival
time. IL-8 overexpression suppressed gefitinib-induced apoptosis in gefitinibsensitive cells. By contrast, suppression of IL-8 enhanced gefitinib-induced cell death
in gefitinib-resistant cells. IL-8 also increased stem-like characteristics including
aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, expression of stemness-related genes, clonogenic
activity, side-population, and in vivo tumorigenicity. Consistently, knockdown of IL-8
leads to loss of stem cell-like characteristics in gefitinib-resistant cells. Our study
demonstrates an important role for IL-8, and suggests IL-8 is a potential therapeutic
target for overcoming EGFR TKI resistance.

resistance after around 10 months of therapy. The EGFRT790M secondary mutation and c-MET amplification
contribute to the majority of acquired resistance [3].
However, there are still some resistant mechanisms are
incompletely understood. To facilitate the development
of effective therapies against NSCLC, we elucidate
the EGFR TKI-resistance machinery underlying tumor
progression.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide [1]. Epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are
successfully used in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients harboring EGFR-activating mutations [2].
Despite early responses to EGFR-TKIs, cancers develop

We previously demonstrated that epithelialmesenchymal-transition (EMT), a process in which
epithelial cells lose cell polarity, confers resistance to
gefitinib [4]. EMT is regulated by chemokines [5, 6].
CCL18, inducing EMT and chemoresistance, was shown
to elevate in adenocarcinoma patients and correlated
with poor survival [7]. The chemokine, CXCL1/2,
whose release was triggered by chemotherapeutic agents,
conferred resistance to doxorubicin [8]. Trastuzumabresistant cells with an EMT phenotype were shown to
secrete more IL-6 and be highly enriched with cancer stem
cells (CSCs) [9]. CXCL12 evokes mobilization of lung
cancer cells and confers a high capacity for self-renewal
on these cells [10]. Blocking receptors for the chemokines
CXCL1 and CXCL12 retards tumor growth, reduces
invasion, eliminates CSCs, and restores drug sensitivity
[10, 11]. These suggest that chemokines are associated
with the features of CSC and treatment resistance.
Accumulating evidence demonstrates that CSCs
are capable of driving tumorigenesis, and resistance
to chemotherapeutics and TKIs [12–14]. CSCs were
identified and purified in lung cancer using functional
assays including aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity
and side population [15–17]. We previously demonstrated
that gefitinib-resistant cells (PC9/gef) exhibited stemlike characteristics, such as high potential for sphere
formation, expression of stemness-related genes, and
ALDH activity [18]. We previously isolated a small
fraction of ALDH-positive cells from gefitinib-sensitive
PC9 cells. These ALDH-positive cells have higher
expression of stem cell features and are more resistant
to gefitinib, and chemotherapeutic agents compared with
ALDH-negative PC9 cells [18]. Side population has been
shown to be enriched for CSCs [17]. Dr. Shien et al.
reported that exposure to high-concentration of gefitinib
resulted in expansion of side population and EGFR TKI
resistance [19]. Hence, it was suggested that the subset
of side population cells in the heterogeneous cancer cell
population was resistant to EGFR TKIs.
In this study, we investigated the role of chemokine
in modulating cellular sensitivity to gefitinib in lung
cancer cells. We found that IL-8 plays a role in the
gefitinib-resistance machinery through regulation of the
CSC population.

was set up to identify the predominant molecular network
listed in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
database (KEGG) (Supplementary Table S2). The
differentially expressed genes of the predominant networkcytokine-cytokine receptor interaction included IL-1,
IL-6 and IL-8 (Table 1). IL-1A, IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8 are
well-characterized cytokines involved in inflammation
or chemoresistance [21]. We examined expression of
IL-1A, IL-1B, IL-6 and IL-8 in two pairs of gefitinibsensitive (PC9, and HCC827) and gefitinib-resistant (PC9/
gef, and HCC827/gef) lung cancer cell lines to identify
the specific cytokine involved in gefitinib resistance
by RT-qPCR. We showed that IL-1A, IL-6, and IL-8
were up-regulated in PC9/gef, but only IL-8 mRNA was
up-regulated in HCC827/gef (Fig. 1a-b). IL-8 protein was
significantly elevated in PC9/gef and HCC827/gef (Fig. 1c).
Studied has reported that IL-8 is elevated in the
plasma of cancer patients, and IL-8 is associated with
poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy [22, 23].
Accordingly, we investigated whether IL-8 was involved
in gefitinib resistance. Besides IL-8, IL-8-specific
receptors, CXCR1, was significantly up-regulated in
PC9/gef cells (Supplementary Fig. S1a). CXCR1 is
undetectable, but CXCR2 was up-regulated in HCC827/
gef cells (Supplementary Fig. S1b). We suggested that
IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling was involved in EGFR TKI
resistance.

High plasma IL-8 level revealed a shorter
progression-free-survival of EGFR TKI-treated
EGFR-mutation positive lung adenocarcinoma
patients
To investigate the association of IL-8 levels with
EGFR TKIs responsiveness, we collected peripheral blood
samples from 75 stage IV lung adenocarcinoma patients
with EGFR-mutation positive tumors and receiving EGFRTKIs only as the first-line treatment. The EGFR mutation
status of these patients was summarized in Supplementary
Table S3. Of the 75 patients, 66 received gefitinib and nine
received erlotinib. According to the median plasma IL-8
level (6.74 pg/mL), we divided patients into high-IL-8 and
low-IL-8 groups. There were no significant differences in
the clinical characteristics of high and low IL-8 groups
(Table 2). However, median progression-free survival was
longer in the low IL-8 group (13 months) than in the high
IL-8 group (8.5 months; p = 0.02; Fig. 1d).

RESULTS
IL-8 was identified as a potential chemokine with
EGFR-TKI resistance through genetic screens

IL-8 conferred resistance to EGFR TKI
To examine the role of IL-8 in the resistance to
EGFR TKI, we established an IL-8-expressing PC9 cell
line (PC9/IL-8). PC9/IL-8 expressed higher levels of
IL-8 mRNA and protein than the control cells (PC9/
mock) (Fig. 2a-b). Increased Akt phosphorylation,
NF-κB p50 nuclear translocation, and higher invasion

To investigate genes capable of conferring gefitinibresistance in lung cancer cells, we selected a pair of cell
lines- one gefitinib-sensitive (PC9) and one gefitinibresistant (PC9/gef)- for analysis using oligonucleotide
cDNA microarrays. An analysis of differentially expressed

pathway (Supplementary Fig. S2).
The percentage of apoptotic cells, quantified by
Annexin-V-positive cells, significantly decreased in PC9/
IL-8 than in PC9/mock following exposure to gefitinib
(Fig. 2c). Furthermore, treatment with gefitinib clearly
induced cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in PC9/mock (Fig. 2d).
In contrast, activation of these pro-apoptotic proteins was
inhibited in PC9/IL-8 cells (Fig. 2d). These results provide
the first evidence that introduction of IL-8 into gefitinibsensitive lung cancer cells protects cells against gefitinibinduced apoptosis.

gef-shCTL cells (Fig. 3c). Gefitinib-induced caspase-9
activity was significantly increased in PC9/gef-shIL8 cells
compared with PC9/gef-shCTL cells (Fig. 3d). Moreover,
we showed that knockdown of IL-8 with small interfering
RNA (siIL-8) also resulted in recovery of gefitinib-induced
apoptosis in PC9/gef or HCC827/gef cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Collectively, these results indicate that IL-8 plays
a crucial role in gefitinib resistance.

IL-8 increased stem cell-like characteristics in
lung cancer cells
EMT is a biological process by which epithelial
cells lose cell-cell adhesion, and have less E-cadherin
expression. Both the EMT regulator (Slug) and IL-8 were
up-regulated in PC9/gef cells and conferred resistance to
gefitinib [4]. To investigate whether IL-8 initiated EMT to
result in gefitinib resistance, we examined the expression
of EMT-related genes. However, overexpression of IL-8
didn’t induce EMT or up-regulation of EMT-related
genes in PC9/IL-8 cells compared with PC9/mock cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4). The EMT regulator (Slug) and
IL-8 are involved in cell motility, and invasion in previous
reports and this study, respectively [4]. Slug initiates cell
invasion through repression of E-cadherin and activation of

Suppression of IL-8 enhanced gefitinib-induced
cell death in EGFR TKI-resistant cells
To investigate whether knockdown of IL-8 could
result in increasing gefitinib sensitivity, small hairpin
RNA (shRNA) against IL-8 was used to knockdown
IL-8 in PC9/gef, and we established two stable shIL8
cell lines with independent target sequences against IL-8
(PC9/gef-shIL8–1 and PC9/gef-shIL8–2) (Supplementary
Table S4). We showed that both PC9/gef-shIL8 cell lines
expressed lower levels of IL-8 than the control cells (PC9/
gef-shCTL) (Fig. 3a-b). Both PC9/gef-shIL8 cell lines

EMT, but IL-8 promotes cell motility by directly activating
Rac GTPase (one member of Rho family) instead of
regulating EMT mediators in previous studies [24, 25].
We previously showed that PC9/gef presented a higher
proportion of ALDH-positive compared with PC9 cells and
ALDH-positive cells in PC9 cells were resistant to gefitinib
[18]. Here, we isolated ALDH-positive and ALDHnegative sub-populations from PC9/gef to determine the
correlation between IL-8 expression and ALDH activity.
Intriguingly, the ALDH-positive sub-population from PC9/
gef showed simultaneously increased IL-8 (Supplementary
Fig. S5), supporting a positive correlation between IL-8
and stem-like characteristic. To investigate whether IL-8
contributes to stem-cell like activity, we found that the
ALDH-positive cell population was increased in PC9/IL-8
cells compared with PC9/mock cells (Fig. 4a). A number
of stem cell-associated genes, including Nanog, Oct4, and
Sox2, were also significantly up-regulated in PC9/IL-8
cells (Fig. 4b); others, including Bmi-1, c-Myc, Klf4 and
Nestin, were not different.
Side populations have been shown to be enriched
for cancer stem-like cells. Using Hoechst 33342 dye
and verapamil to characterize the side population,
we found a significant increase in the side population
fraction in PC9/IL-8 cells compared to PC9/mock cells
(0.33% vs. 0.09%) (Fig. 4c). Using another pair of cells,
we found a significant increase of side population fraction
in HCC827/IL-8 cells compared with HCC827/mock
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells (1.86%  vs.  0.53%) (Supplementary Fig. S6a-c).
Furthermore, we performed colony-forming assays to
investigate whether IL-8 drives the development of stem
cell-like properties. Compared with PC9/mock cells, PC9/
IL-8 cells gave rise to more and larger colonies in soft-agar
cultures (Fig. 4d). We also found a significant increase of
colonies in HCC827/IL-8 than HCC827/mock cells by
clonogenic assay (Supplementary Fig. S6d), indicating
IL-8 contributes to the inhibition of gefitinib-induced cell
death and the development of stem cell-like characteristics.
To further evaluate the effect of IL-8 on cell proliferation,
we performed assays on growth rate, cell cycle and
proliferation-related proteins (PCNA and cyclin  D1).
The cell proliferation rates of mock-infected and
IL-8-infected cells were similar (Supplementary Fig. S7a).
Moreover, over-expression of IL-8 didn’t result in
change of cell cycle and proliferation-related proteins
(Supplementary Fig. S7b-c). Therefore, we excluded that
IL-8 increased cell proliferation to lead to more colonies.
To determine the tumorigenicity in vivo, we
subcutaneously injected cells into NOD.SICD mice
and found that PC9/IL-8 cells gave rise to more visible
tumors than PC9/mock cells (Fig. 4e). And, HematoxylinEosin (H&E) stains of tumors from NOD.SCID mice
injected with PC9/mock or PC9/IL-8 cells were shown
in Fig. 4f. These results suggest that the IL-8-expressing
cell population harbors a larger compartment of stem-like
cancer cells with a higher potential for tumorigenicity.

cells (Fig. 5c). Similarly, the ALDH activity was downregulated in siIL-8 cells (Fig. 5d). Moreover, IL-8
knockdown also reduced the side population fraction
(1.10% vs. 0.50%) and diminished colonies in PC9/gef
(Fig. 5e-f). The effects of knockdown of IL-8 in HCC827/
gef cells were also assessed. Likewise, knockdown of IL-8
had most inhibitory potency on ALDH1A1, Nanog, Bmi-1,
and Sox-2 in HCC827/gef cells (Supplementary Fig. S8d).
The side population fraction (1.15% vs. 0.52%) and
colonies in long-term clonogenicity assay were both
suppressed in HCC827/gef after knockdown of IL-8
(Supplementary Fig. S8e-f). These results indicated that
IL-8 is critical in regulating stem cell-like characteristics
and gefitinib resistance in lung cancer cells.

We previously showed that PC9/gef cells presented
a higher proportion of ALDH-positive cells than PC9
cells [18]. To identify more stemness-like abilities, we
made an attempt to conduct side population analysis
and investigate stemness-related gene expressions.
Hoechst 33342 staining showed that PC9/gef displayed
the presence of side population cells in 1.34% (Fig. 5a).
Conversely, PC9 cells included less side population cells
in 0.42% (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, HCC827/gef cells also
displayed side population cells and more colonies than
HCC827 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8a-b). We next
investigated the expression of stemness-related genes
between two pairs of EGFR TKI-sensitive and EGFR
TKI-resistant cells. ALDH1A1, Nanog, and Sox-2 were
significantly up-regulated in PC9/gef (Fig. 5b). Similarly,
up-regulation of stemness-related genes (ALDH1A1,
Nanog, Nestin, Bmi1, and Oct4) was observed in HCC87/
gef cells (Supplementary Fig. S8c), implying that these
gefitinib-resistant cells contained a larger population of
tumor-initiating cells. To determine whether IL-8 was
involved in conferring stemness in PC9/gef and HCC827/
gef cells, stemness-related gene expressions were
evaluated after knockdown of IL-8. Notably, the stemnessrelated ALDH1A1, and Nanog were mostly suppressed
in siIL-8 cells compared with control scrambled siRNA

IL-8 conferred resistance to chemotherapy
Since IL-8 induced stem-like properties, we
suggested that IL-8 confers resistance to traditional
chemotherapy (such as paclitaxol). Cell viability assays
were performed to evaluate the paclitaxol-induced apoptosis
between PC9/mock and PC9/IL-8 cells. Both the percentage
of AnnexinV-positive cells and paclitaxol-induced cell death
were inhibited in PC9/IL-8 cells (Supplementary Fig. S9a-b).
Moreover, we made an attempt to suppress IL-8 activity
using neutralizing IL-8 antibody and investigated
whether it can promote paclitaxol-induced cell death.
We showed that neutralizing IL-8 antibody enhanced

DISCUSSION

Effect of exogenous IL-8 on stemness and EGFRTKI resistance

EGFR-TKIs have been widely used in treating nonsmall cell lung cancers with EGFR mutation-positive [26].
In the present study, IL-8 is highly associated with the
cellular stemness and EGFR TKI resistance in lung cancer
cells. We demonstrated that IL-8 elicits a protective effect
against gefitinib-induced apoptosis and caspase activation.
Knockdown of IL-8 circumvented EGFR TKI resistance
and promoted gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Delineating the
function of IL-8 in EGFR TKI resistance, we showed that
IL-8 is capable of driving stem cell-like characteristics
in lung cancer cells. Etopic introduction of IL-8 resulted
in increase of side population, a greater potential for
anchorage-independent growth, higher ALDH activity,
and in vivo tumorigenic activity. In contrast, IL-8
inhibition in gefitinib-resistant cells diminished stem

To investigate whether exogenous IL-8 contributes
to stemness and EGFR-TKI resistance, recombinant
human IL-8 (rhIL-8) was used. Treatment with rhIL-8
significantly increased Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 mRNA
in PC9 cells, as determined by RT-qPCR (Fig. 6a-c).
This result was consistent with the observation in
Fig. 4b, as we showed that Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 were
up-regulated in PC9/IL-8 cells. Further, we evaluated
whether exogenous rhIL-8 could confer resistance
against gefitinib. PC9 cells were cultured with various
concentrations of rhIL-8 for one day, and then exposed
to gefitinib for one day. As shown in Fig. 6d, IL-8-treated
PC9 cells displayed resistance to gefitinib. This result

HCC827/gef cells (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 8d).
However, we observed that Bmi-1 and Nestin were
up-regulated only in HCC827/gef cells, but not in PC9/gef
cells (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 8c). It indicated that
stemness-related genes may be differently regulated by
IL-8 in PC9/gef and HCC827/gef cells. Previous studies
showed that IL-8 and its cognate receptors, CXCR1/
CXCR2, played an important role in CSC activity and
chemoresistance. Recently, several studies indicated
that specific blockade of CXCR1 or CXCR2 with
neutralizing antibodies resulted in different inhibition of
CSC population and cancer cell growth [11, 36]. It was
suggested that the effect of IL-8 was mediated by CXCR1
and CXCR2, but the selection of receptor for IL-8 binding
and actions were in a cell type-specific manner. In our
study, we showed that PC9 cells are more abundant of
CXCR1 than HCC827 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). We
suggest that the differential expression of CXCR1 and
CXCR2 in these cell lines (PC9, and HCC827) may have
different influence on CSC activity and other actions under
IL-8 stimulation or knockdown of IL-8.
Besides IL-8, IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1
receptor) pathway was involved in gefitinib-resistance and
stemness in gefitinib-resistant PC9 and HCC827 cells [42].
Activation of IGF1-IGF1R axis increased several stem
cell markers (such as CD133, ALDH1A1, Oct4, Nanog,
CXCR4, and Sox2) both in PC9/gef and HCC827/gef
cells [42]. In our microarray database, we didn’t observe
up-regulation of IGF1 in PC9/gef cells. We suggested
that different culture conditions and methods (step-wise
escalation or high-concentration of gefitinib) used to
establish gefitinib-resistant cell lines activate different
pathways and stemness-related genes [42]. It should
be concerned that the manner of EGFR TKI exposure
influences the change of genotype and phenotype in EGFR
TKI-resistant cells.
Studies have revealed that IL-8 secretion were
­up-regulated under chemotherapy, and IL-8 increased
cancer stem cell populations [43, 44]. Moreover, IL-8
receptor, CXCR1, is also specially expressed in an
ALDH-positive cancer cell sub-population and these
cells are resistant to FASL-induced apoptosis [11].
Blockade of the CXCR1 evoked FasL-mediated
apoptosis in a CSC sub-population. It suggests that the
IL-8/CXCR-1 axis is associated with stem cell renewal
and setmness-related sphere formation is diminished
upon IL-8 inhibition [11, 45]. Interestingly, lung cancer
cells surviving treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs
in SCID mice propagated with CSCs-like characteristics
and expressed elevated levels of CXCR1/2 [46].
Consistent with these findings, we showed that PC9/IL-8
cells have greater tumorigenesis potential in NOD.SCID
mice and possess a larger fraction of side population
cells compared to PC9/mock cells. We further found that

cell-like characteristics, and increased gefitinib-induced
apoptosis. Moreover, high plasma IL-8 was associated
with poor-progression-free survival in EGFR mutationpositive NSCLC patients receiving EGFR TKI as first-line
treatment.
In the study, we identified that several chemokines
were up-regulated in gefitinib-resistant cells including
CXCL-1, CXCL-2, CXCL-6, and IL-8 (Table 1).
Accumulating evidences have revealed that chemokines
promote cancer cell growth and are associated with
treatment resistance [25, 27]. Stromal cell-derived factor-1
is associated with tumor recurrence [28], and CXCL-1/2
mediate the chemoresistance in lung cancer [8]. Likewise,
the role of IL-8 in mediating cancer cell migration,
proliferation, and chemoresistance in an autocrine or
paracrine manners has been demonstrated previously
[27, 29]. Elevated IL-8 levels have been demonstrated in
several type of cancers, and was correlated with survival
or relapse [30–33]. Previous reports showed that the serum
levels of IL-8 in lung cancer patients were in the pg/mL
range [34–36], which is similar to our study. Previous
studies also demonstrated that the level of IL-8 in cell
supernatant (100 pg/mL) is consistent with serum level
of IL-8, such as HCT116 cells [27, 36]. Furthermore, the
level of IL-8 in cell line culture medium depended on cell
type and absolute cell number [33, 36]. In this study, we
showed the level of IL-8 was consistent with previous
reports.
Increased tumorigenic activity, and re-activation
of survival signaling including PI3K/Akt, and Ras/Raf/
MAPK by IL-8 stimulation are demonstrated to confer
resistance against chemotherapy [6, 29]. We showed that
Akt is hyper-phosphorylated in IL-8-overexpressing cells.
The PI3K/Akt pathway is one of the principal downstream
effectors of IL-8-dependent, CXCR1/2-mediated
signaling, leading to tumor progression [37]. Activation
of the CXCR1/2 signaling by IL-8 leads to activation of
NF-κB, forming a positive feedback loop further promotes
tumor development [38]. In contrast, shutdown of IL-8
signaling via siRNA or neutralizing antibodies leads to
sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy [39]. IL-8 was
previously supposed to transactivate EGFR signaling
in NSCLC [40]. Here, we showed the first time that
IL-8 plasma level in NSCLC patients is correlated with
duration of EGFR TKI treatment in NSCLC (Fig. 1d), and
IL-8 intervenes in resistance of EGFR TKIs (Figs. 2, 3, and
Supplementary Fig. S3).
As a notable finding, soluble cytokines and
chemokines may regulate stem cell-like characteristics, and
emerging evidence has shown that CSCs are responsible
for tumor growth and metastasis, and contribute to
chemotherapy resistance and relapse. CSC’s marker
expression is a critical element to distinguish cancer cells
into stem-like or non-stem-like cells. Side population,
ALDH activity and Naong expression have been
recognized as hallmarks of lung stem cell markers [41].

CXCR1/2 was up-regulated in gefitinib-resistant cells,
which would enhance the sensitivity to IL-8-mediated
signal activation.
IL-8 expression was shown to be enriched in the side
population of human melanoma cells which are capable of
excluding anticancer drugs [47]. Side population cells are
abundant of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters [48].
Study reported that side population cells showed a great
potential against EGFR TKI-induced apoptosis [19], and
we consistently found ABCB1 transporter is up-regulated
in EGFR TKI-resistant cells (data not shown). However,
it is still unclear whether EGFR TKIs are substrates of
ABC transporters, and the association between EGFR TKI
resistance and ABC transporters is controversial.
In conclusion, our data suggest that diminishing
the CSC sub-population through depletion of IL-8
in combination with gefitinib administration might
potentially overcome EGFR-TKI resistance.

Quantitative-PCR was carried out on an ABI 7500 system.
Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using
the 2−∆Ct method, where ∆Ct = (sample Ct – TBP Ct). It
was considered “undetectable” if the value of Ct > 40.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well
in a 24-well plate. After cells had adhered, the culture
medium was replaced with fresh medium and plates were
incubated for 48 hours. Supernatants were collected for
quantification of IL-8 protein using a Quantikine IL-8
ELISA kit (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN).

Patient population and study design
All treatment-naive patients with stage IV lung
adenocarcinoma diagnosed between October 2010 and
October 2013 were identified. Only those with EGFR
mutation-positive and who received EGFR-TKIs as their
first-line treatment were investigated in this study. Plasma
IL-8 level in patients was determined by IL-8 ELISA kit
and this study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of National Taiwan University Hospital.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
We established the gefitinib-resistant lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines- PC9/gef and HCC827/gef from
gefitinib-sensitive cells- PC9 and HCC827, respectively
[4, 20]. PC9/IL-8, HCC827/IL-8 and PC9/gef-shIL8 cells
were generated by stable lentiviral infection with the
IL-8 gene in PC9, HCC827 cells or shRNA against IL-8
in PC9/gef cells. These cell lines were authenticated using
short tandem repeat profiling. All cell lines were cultured
in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and propagated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2
incubator.

Apoptosis assays
Apoptosis was detected using an Annexin-V-FITC
detection kit (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells were incubated
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) for 15 minutes in the
dark. Analyses were performed using flow cytometry and
CXP analysis software (Beckman Coulter, CA).

Anchorage-independent growth
Cells were suspended in top agar (0.35% agarose)
and plated in triplicate onto bottom layers of 0.5% agar in
a 6-well plate. The cells were fed 2 mL of medium every
5–7 days. Colonies were photographed after 4 weeks and
analyzed using Image J software.

Oligonucleotide microarray
Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles of
PC9 and PC9/gef were generated using Affymetrix Human
Genome U133 plus 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix; Santa
Clara, CA), which contain 54,675 probe sets capable of
analyzing the expression levels of 47,400 transcripts and
variants. Oligonucleotide cDNA microarray analyses were
performed by the Integrated Core Facility for Functional
Genomics of National Science Council in Taiwan
according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Santa Clara,
CA, http://www.affymetrix.com/). The expression profiles
were deposited in the GEO database (GSE60189).

Determination of tumorigenicity in NOD.
SCID mice
Animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC
No.20110492) of the National Taiwan University, Taiwan.
NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/NcrCrlBltw (NOD.SCID) male
mice (BioLASCO; Taipei, Taiwan) at five weeks old
were transplanted with cells. Briefly, cancer cells were
suspended in HBSS buffer at density of 5 × 105 cells/mL,
and subcutaneously injected into each mouse. All mice
were examined regularly for the development of tumors,
and cells were scored as tumorigenic if a palpable nodule
appeared at the site of injection within 10 weeks and
increased in size.

Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-qPCR)
Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated
using a High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems; Foster city, CA). Gene specific
primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

ALDH activity

Conflicts of interest

The ALDEFLUOR kit (Stemcell Technologies;
Vancouver, Canada) was used to identify cell
populations with ALDH enzymatic activity. Cells were
suspended in ALDEFLUOR Assay Buffer containing
ALDH substrate. Following a 30 minute incubation at
37°C and centrifugation, the cells were re-suspended
for analysis using a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences). Samples treated with the inhibitor,
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), were used as
negative controls to gate the ALDH-negative region.

The authors declare that they have no conflicts of
interest exist.
