Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a relatively rare cutaneous malignancy that occurs
predominantly in the older white population. The incidence of MCC appears to
have tripled during the past 20 years; an increase that is likely to continue because
of the growing number of older Americans. The pathogenesis of MCC remains
largely unknown. However, ultraviolet radiation and immunosuppression are likely
to play a significant pathogenetic role. Many questions currently remain unanswered regarding the biologic behavior and optimal treatment of MCC. Large, prospective, randomized studies are not available and are unlikely to be performed

n increasing number of patients presenting with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) during the past 2 decades has focused attention
on this cutaneous malignancy, which is seen primarily in older individuals. Based on the projection that, by 2030, 1 in 5 Americans will be
aged 65 years, the increasing trend in MCC incidence is likely to
continue.1 Currently, information regarding the biologic behavior and
optimal treatment of MCC is limited given the paucity of high-level
evidence and the absence of prospective, randomized trials. The
objective of this review was to create a current reference for those
involved in the care of patients with MCC or the investigation of this
potentially aggressive malignancy. This review was based on a critical
evaluation of the available data using an extensive PubMed search
combined with our experience in the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center Multidisciplinary MCC program.

Epidemiology
The incidence of MCC is low compared with the incidence of other
cutaneous malignancies. However, the trend is toward an increasing

number of cases. Based on data from the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the ageadjusted MCC incidence rate has tripled from 0.15
per 100,000 in 1986 to 0.44 per 100,000 in 2001
(1400 cases per year). This represents an annual 8%
increase for MCC during this period compared with
a 3% increase for melanoma.2 MCC is 24 times more
common in individuals aged >65 years than in individuals aged <65 years, and only 5% of cases are
diagnosed before age 50. The majority of patients
(94%) who are diagnosed with MCC are white. A
slight male predominance is reported by most studies.2–4

Risk Factors
Several observations support the hypothesis that
ultraviolet (UV) radiation may be a pathogenetic factor in MCC. Most MCCs are located on sun-exposed
areas of the skin.3,4 SEER data from various geographic locations have revealed a correlation between solar UV-B indexes and regional differences in
MCC incidence.5 A 100-fold increase in MCC incidence has been reported in patients with psoriasis
who were treated with UV-A and methoxsalen.6 The
concomitant occurrence of MCC and squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) lends further support to the association with UV exposure.7
Indirect evidence of an association between
MCC and immunosuppression is plentiful. In 1 large
series, 14.5% of patients with MCC were receiving or
had received immunosuppressive therapy.4 A transplantation tumor registry reported 48 patients with
MCC, mostly in renal transplantation recipients
(93%).8 In contrast to MCC in the general population,
49% of transplantation patients with MCC were aged
50 years. The ratio of posttransplantation melanoma to MCC is 6:1 compared with 65:1 in the general population.9 Several other cases of MCC
associated with iatrogenic immunosuppression have
been reported.10,11
In patients with human immunodeficiency virus
or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the relative
risk of MCC is 13.4 compared with the general population.12 An increased rate of other malignancies in
patients with MCC further supports an impaired
immune status in the pathogenesis of some cases of
MCC. An increased risk of MCC as a second primary
malignancy has been identified among patients with
multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and melanoma.13 Several
cases of MCC have been linked to chronic arsenic

exposure, implicating this carcinogen in the pathogenesis of MCC in these patients.14

Molecular Pathogenesis
Cytogenetic analysis has revealed several chromosomal abnormalities in MCC tumors and cell lines.
Structural aberrations involving the short arm of
chromosome 1 (1p) have been observed in 40% of
the patients studied.15 Loss of heterozygosity on 1p
occurs frequently in MCC, leading to the hypothesis
that one or more tumor suppressor genes on 1p may
play a pathogenetic role.16 Although the localization
of proto-oncogenes related to other neural crestderived tumors, such as neuroblastoma and melanoma, has focused further attention to this region,
no conclusive candidate genes have been identified
in MCC. UV-B-specific mutations in the p53 and Haras genes are observed commonly in MCC and cutaneous SCC. Farnesylthiosalicylic acid, which is an inhibitor of ras signal transduction, has been shown to
up-regulate p53 and induce apoptosis and inhibition
of tumor growth in human MCC in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model.17
High expression of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene, which
is capable of inhibiting apoptosis, thereby promoting
cell survival and contributing to tumor growth, was
observed in 5 of 10 patients with MCC, although no
relation between gene expression and survival was
observed.18 Bcl-2 antisense treatment did result in a
dramatic reduction of tumor growth and complete
remission in an SCID mouse model.19 Activation of
the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway through oncogenic mutations in BRAF, which
are observed commonly in melanoma, was not
observed in MCC, indicating that other signal transduction pathways are most likely involved.20
The Merkel Cell
In 1875, Friedrich Sigmund Merkel described large,
pale cells in the basal layer of the epidermis forming
synapse-like contacts with enlarged nerve terminals.21 These cells, now commonly referred to as
Merkel cells, function as mechanoreceptors. Merkel
cells resemble cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine
system, or amine precursor uptake decarboxylation
system. Ultrastructurally, the cells are characterized
by a lobulated nucleus, finger-like protoplasmic protrusions, and cytoplasmic dense-core granules facing
the nerve terminal. Low-molecular-weight cytokeratins (CKs), CK-20 in particular, are highly specific
markers for light microscopic identification of Merkel
cells.22 The neural crest origin of Merkel cells has
been confirmed by a transgenic mouse model.23

In 1972, Toker described a trabecular carcinoma
of the skin that originally was believed to be derived
from sweat glands.24 In 1978, Tang and Toker identified dense-core granules in these trabecular tumors,
suggesting an origin from Merkel cells.25 Whether
MCC arises from normal Merkel cells still is debated.
Arguments in favor of a normal Merkel cell origin are
the mutual presence of dense-core granules and
positive staining for neurofilaments and CK-20. Several cases of MCC confined to the epidermis have
been reported, suggesting that, at least in some
cases, MCC arises from normal epidermal Merkel
cells.26 However, the rarity of such epidermal involvement has lead some to consider a pluripotent dermal stem cell as the cell of origin.26

Clinical Presentation
MCC is rarely suspected clinically at the time of presentation. The differential diagnosis may include basal cell carcinoma, cyst, SCC, pyogenic granuloma,
melanoma, lymphoma cutis, or lipoma. If a typical
clinical presentation can be described, then MCC
most commonly presents as a blue or red, firm, nontender, solitary, dome-shaped nodule (Figs. 1 and 2).
Tumors may have a plaque-like appearance or may
present as a subcutaneous mass without epidermal
changes (Fig. 3). Although the overlying skin may be
ulcerated, it is frequently intact. In our experience,
the growth rate appears quite rapid in many patients.
Tumor size is frequently <2 cm but may reach 20
cm.27 Lesions on the head and neck typically are
smaller than lesions in other locations.3 The 2 most
common locations for MCC include the head and
neck region and the extremities, which, together,

account for 70% to 90% of cases. The remaining
MCCs are located on the trunk and buttocks.3,4 Primary MCC also has been reported on the oral and
genital mucosa.28,29
The reported frequency of in-transit, lymph
node, and distant metastasis in MCC ranges widely
(20–75%) and may be biased toward tertiary center
reports.3,4,30–32 The most common location of metastasis is the draining lymph node basin (27–60%), followed by distant skin (9–30%), lung (10–23%), central
nervous system (18%), bone (10–15%), and liver
(13%).3,4,32 The high reported rate of cutaneous metastasis is likely explained by the inclusion of satellite
and in-transit metastases (Fig. 4). Other reported
areas of distant metastasis include testis, pancreas,
heart, bone marrow, pleura, parotid, gastrointestinal
tract, prostate, and bladder.33–40 The rate of MCC

presenting as metastatic disease with unknown primary ranges from 3% to 19%.4,41
Greater than 10 cases of complete spontaneous
regression (CSR) of MCC have been reported.42
Because the estimated prevalence of CSR in all neoplasms is <1 in 60,000 to 100,000 cases, the number
of reported cases of CSR in MCC is intriguing.43
Although the mechanism of CSR in MCC is
unknown, an immunologic response triggered by
trauma, such as a previous biopsy, has been postulated.43,44

FIGURE 5. Scanning magnification of Merkel cell carcinoma demonstrates
Histopathology
MCC typically has the microscopic appearance of a
dermal tumor nodule, which frequently extends into
the subcutaneous fat (Fig. 5). The tumor is composed of small blue cells with round-to-oval, hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. The nuclei
have evenly dispersed, peppered chromatin and
inconspicuous nucleoli (Fig. 6). Commonly seen histopathologic features include vascular invasion (31–
60%), tumor necrosis (48–60%), perineural invasion
(48%), and high mitotic rate (117 in 132 tumors had
>5 mitoses per high-power field in 1 large series).45,46 Ulceration may be present but is observed
only a minority of cases.45,46 Epidermal involvement
has been reported in 5% to 30% of tumors either in
the form of epidermotropism or carcinoma in situ.
Most cases of intraepidermal MCC have been
observed in association with squamous cell atypia.26
Although they are insignificant clinically, 3 histologic subtypes have been recognized and frequently
are admixed. The intermediate variant, which is the
most common subtype, is observed in 50% of
tumors. It is characterized by large, solid nodules

and diffuse sheets of basophilic cells. The small cell
variant consists of diffusely infiltrating sheets of irregular, hyperchromatic cells that frequently display
crush artifact and nuclear molding. This subtype has
considerable histologic overlap with bronchial small
cell carcinoma. The trabecular variant consists of
delicate ribbons of small basophilic cells separated
by strands of connective tissue and normally is
observed only in association with other histologic
subtypes.27,47

Immunohistochemistry
MCC, as a small round blue cell tumor, must be differentiated from metastatic visceral neuroendocrine
carcinomas, particularly from small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). This distinction can be accomplished
with near certainty by using immunohistochemical
analysis. CK-20, a low-molecular-weight intermediate
filament, is a highly sensitive marker for MCC, staining positively in a paranuclear, dot-like pattern in

89% to 100% of tumors (Fig. 7). However, up to 33%
of SCLC and 3% to 4% of extrapulmonary small cell
carcinomas also stain positively for CK-20. The identification of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) in
SCLC has provided a valuable addition to the immunohistochemical armamentarium. TTF-1 is expressed
in 83% to 100% of SCLC yet consistently is absent in
MCC.48,49 However, more variable TTF-1 staining in
extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (3–42% positivity) indicates that, although a negative TTF-1 stain
supports a diagnosis of MCC, it does not confirm the
diagnosis conclusively.50 Similarly, CK-7 is expressed
in SCLC but characteristically is negative in MCC.
Other markers with a high sensitivity for MCC and,
to a lesser degree, for SCLC include neuron-specific
enolase, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, BER-EP4,
and CAM 5.2.48,51 Neurofilament protein (NFP) is not
expressed as frequently (63–100%) in MCC as CK-20;
however, because it is consistently negative in SCLC,
it is a useful marker to help differentiate MCC from
SCLC.48 MCC invariably is negative for S-100 and
leukocyte-common antigen, distinguishing it from
small cell melanoma and cutaneous lymphoma,
respectively. The majority of primary and metastatic
MCCs express KIT receptor tyrosine kinase (CD117),
which also is expressed in a variety of other malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and
SCLC.52

Staging, Workup, and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
An established and well-recognized staging system is
not yet available for MCC. Most clinicians use a 3tiered system based on the presence or absence of
lymph node or distant disease. Investigators at Me-

morial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) identified tumor diameter as an independent predictor of
survival and developed a 4-tiered staging system in
1999.53 The same group recently proposed a modified 4-tiered system that separates patients with localized disease into stage I (primary tumor dimension
<2 cm) and stage II (primary tumor dimension 2
cm). Patients with regional or distant metastatic disease are classified as stage III and IV, respectively.3
This classification is consistent with the American
Joint Committee on Cancer 4-tiered paradigm for
staging systems and is used throughout the remainder of this review.
The majority of patients with MCC (70%) present with stage I or II disease, 25% have palpable regional lymphadenopathy at presentation (stage III),
and 5% present with distant metastases (stage
IV).3,4,54 The overall 5-year survival rates reportedly
range from 30% to 64%.41,55–59 Disease stage was
identified as the strongest predictor of survival in 1
large series (stage I, 81% 5-year survival rate; stage
II, 67% 5-year survival rate; stage III, 52% 5-year survival rate; stage IV, 11% 2-year survival rate).3
Although disease-specific survival rates based on
stage are reported infrequently in other studies, 5year survival rates have been reported as 44% to
68% for localized disease (stages I and II) and 23%
to 42% for regional or distant metastatic disease
(stages III and IV).30,60 The reported overall recurrence rate ranged from 40% to 45% in several large
series but reportedly was as high as 77% on the
head and neck.3,4,61 Higher recurrence rates in smaller series may be influenced by unintentional retrospective and tertiary center bias. The median time
to recurrence consistently is reported as 8 months,

Although a chest x-ray is warranted in the initial
workup of a patient with MCC to exclude SCLC, the
value of additional imaging studies is uncertain.
Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
imaging, and positron emission tomography reportedly have been used to detect occult metastatic disease.63,64 However, no curative treatment is available
for stage IV disease, and there is no evidence that
early detection and treatment of asymptomatic, distant metastatic disease has any impact on overall
survival. Moreover, the use of routine imaging studies
in asymptomatic patients with clinically localized
MCC is likely to generate a high false-positive rate,
leading to additional tests and increased patient anxiety.65 A recent study reported that CT imaging lead
to a false-positive rate of 49% for distant MCC metastases yet failed to detect true lymph node disease
in 80% of patients.66
Several clinical, histologic and immunohistochemical parameters have been considered as prognostic indicators for patients with MCC.67–69
Although a recent study indicated that tumor depth
was the only parameter that was correlated with survival in a multivariate analysis, that finding could not
be confirmed by others.70,71 To investigate prognostic
indicators, we have instituted a primary tumor histologic profile and a sentinel lymph node (SLN) histologic profile (Tables 1 and 2). Although smaller,
mostly retrospective series may have dismissed several parameters as prognostic indicators, a systematic, prospective evaluation, which our histologic
profiles will provide, may or may not validate these
observations. In addition, new prognosticators may
be identified.
The most consistent predictor of survival in
MCC to date is the presence or absence of lymph
node disease. In that regard, SLN biopsy (SLNB) is

an invaluable tool. Because of the absence of other
reliable prognostic indicators, SLNB is standard care
for all clinically lymph node-negative patients with
MCC at our institution, unless it is contraindicated
medically. Already endorsed by the American Society
for Clinical Oncology as the preferred staging procedure for breast cancer, level I evidence for the value
of SLNB as a staging test for intermediate depth melanoma recently was provided.72 Although studies are
based on much smaller patient numbers, the value
of SLNB as a staging procedure appears equally important in MCC. Numerous studies have reported the
use of SLNB for patients with clinically lymph nodenegative MCC and found a fairly consistent SLNB
positivity rate of approximately 20% to 30%.66,73,74
Immunohistochemical analysis of SLNs, in particular
with anti-CK-20, is essential to provide acceptable
sensitivity and specificity in identifying micrometastatic MCC (Fig. 8).52,75 In the largest reported series
from a single institution that involved 251 patients,
investigators from MSKCC reported a 5-year survival
rate of 97% versus 52% for pathologically staged
lymph node-negative patients versus lymph nodepositive patients, respectively. The only independent
predictor of survival was the pathologic lymph node
status.3 The prognostic value of lymph node staging
by SLNB in patients with MCC has been confirmed
in smaller series at other institutions.66,74,76

Treatment
Patients with MCC, a tumor that is amenable to surgery and is considered both radiosensitive and
chemosensitive, benefit from management in a multidisciplinary fashion. In melanoma, it has been
demonstrated that a multidisciplinary approach is
beneficial with respect to patient care, efficiency,
outcome, education, research, and cost.77 To emphasize the value of multidisciplinary care for patients
with MCC, treatment is discussed below based on
the stage of disease rather than by medical specialty.

3400).

Localized disease
There is little disagreement that the initial treatment
of primary MCC is usually surgical. Some controversy
exists regarding the appropriate surgical margin.
Although wide local excision (WLE) with margins
from 2 cm to 3 cm historically has been recommended, low local recurrence rates (8%) have been
achieved after margin-negative excision with margins
that averaged 1.1 cm.3,78–80 Obtaining margins <1
cm did not lead to higher recurrence rates compared
with obtaining margins 1 cm (9% vs 10% respectively, P 5 .83).3 Another study that examined Mohs
micrographic surgery for primary MCC, primarily on
the head, neck, and extremities, reported that a
mean margin of only 1.67 cm, with a median margin
of 1 cm, was required to achieve negative margins
with a mean primary tumor size of 1.58 cm.81
Although the limited data, potentially biased toward
smaller lesions, have indicated low local recurrence
rates after Mohs surgery (4–8%), the rates are comparable to those reported with WLE by several groups
(4–14%).3,4,41 To our knowledge, no controlled trials
comparing different margins of excision have been
performed.
Disagreement exists regarding the use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) to the primary site after
WLE. Adjuvant RT doses for MCC vary from 45 Gray
(Gy) to 50 Gy.56 When reviewing the available literature, a distinction must be made between adjuvant
RT to the primary site, the regional lymph node basin, or both. Similarly, when assessing the benefit of
adjuvant RT to the primary site, local recurrence
rates must be distinguished from regional or locoregional recurrences. Several groups have reported

7

relatively low local recurrence rates after WLE only
(4–14%) that did not decrease significantly when adjuvant RT to the primary site was added.3,4,41,81
Other studies, however, have reported or shown
in much higher recurrence rates after surgery
alone.30,55,82 Careful review of these studies raises
several concerns. Most report locoregional recurrence
rates that greatly overestimate the number of true
local recurrences.3 In the largest single-institution series that showed a benefit from adjuvant RT, a recurrence rate of 100% was reported after surgery alone,
which reflected both local and regional recurrences.82
The true local recurrence rate after surgery without
adjuvant RT was 21% (8 of 38 patients). Those investigators reported surgical margins as narrow as 5
mm. Another concern is the heterogeneous nature of
the treatment within the surgery only group, ranging
from excision of the primary tumor with positive
margins to amputation and complete lymph node
dissection (CLND).30,41 Conversely, in a study reporting low local recurrence rates after surgery only, adjuvant RT to the primary basin rarely was delivered
(14%), making a comparison less reliable.3
The question whether excision of primary MCC
should be followed by adjuvant RT to the surgical
bed will remain unanswered until higher level evidence is available. Based on existing evidence, every
effort should be made to excise a primary MCC with
clear surgical margins. Margins of 1 cm frequently
will be negative for small lesions that measure <2
cm in greatest dimension. A 2-cm margin should be
reserved for larger lesions that measure >2 cm in
greatest dimension when feasible.3,4,81 These margins
usually are achievable without high morbidity. Although cosmetic concerns should not be neglected,
tumor clearance of this potentially aggressive malignancy should be the highest priority. When considering Mohs surgery, the following issues must be
considered: If a patient with MCC is taken to the
operating room to undergo SLNB, then it may be in
the patient’s best interest to undergo concurrent
wide excision of the primary tumor rather than performing Mohs surgery on a separate occasion. However, if tissue-sparing is a high priority in locations,
such as the eyelid or nasal ala, then this approach
may be preferable after the patient has undergone
SLNB. Mohs surgery also may be considered if surgical margins are close or positive.
Based on existing data, after WLE with clear surgical margins of smaller primary lesions that measure <2 cm in greatest dimension, adjuvant RT to
the primary site most likely may be omitted.3,4,41,81
When clear surgical margins cannot be obtained or
for larger primary tumors that measure 2 cm,

8

strong consideration should be given to adjuvant RT
to the surgical bed until there is further evidence to
the contrary. Both therapeutic options, however,
should be viewed in conjunction with SLNB. The use
of RT as primary treatment has been reported for
very poor surgical candidates. Successful treatment
with RT alone was reported in 9 patients with primary MCC, which had been considered inoperable,
without recurrence after a mean follow-up of 3
years.83

Regional disease
Lymph node recurrences frequently are lumped into
locoregional recurrence rates and are reported as a
measure of local treatment failure. However, in the
absence of local recurrence, lymph node recurrence
most often represents the delayed manifestation of
micrometastatic disease present at the time of treatment of the primary tumor rather than the result of
inadequate local therapy.84 The rate of lymph node
recurrence is used repeatedly to compare the effectiveness of surgery versus RT. However, most studies
compare excision of the primary site without regional lymph node therapy versus excision of the primary tumor, frequently in combination with CLND,
followed by adjuvant RT to the primary site and the
regional lymph node basin.30,61,82 For example,
Veness et al reported a 37% lymph node recurrence
rate and a 4-month median disease-free survival after surgery versus an 18% lymph node recurrence
rate and a 10.5-month median disease-free survival
after surgery and adjuvant RT.41 Twenty-seven of 36
patients (75%) in the surgery arm underwent WLE
without addressing the lymph node basin. All
patients in the adjuvant RT group underwent RT to
the lymph node basin after treatment of the primary
tumor, and nearly 50% of patients (17 of 36 patients)
underwent CLND.41 These studies do not adequately
compare therapeutic modalities for the regional
lymph node basin but, instead, suggest that patients
had a better outcome when the regional lymph node
basin was addressed. This point is highlighted in a
study by Kokoska et al, who reported a recurrence
rate of 0% (0 of 11 patients) when CLND was performed compared with 91% (20 of 22 patients) without CLND and a recurrence rate of 15% (2 of 13
patients) with RT (presumably regional) and 90% (18
of 20 patients) without RT.78
The compelling question is how best to address
the regional lymph node basin. Adjuvant RT and elective lymph node dissection are options. However, both
approaches are associated with problems historically
encountered in melanoma. First, the majority of

patients without lymph node disease are exposed to
unnecessary treatment. Second, electively treating the
regional lymph node basin, particularly in areas of ambiguous lymphatic drainage (such as the trunk or head
and neck), whether with surgery or RT, may not target
the correct basin and/or interval lymph node.85
Thus, SLNB should be performed to stage the
lymph node basin. This is the most sensitive and
specific test to select appropriate patients and identify the correct basin(s) to direct regional therapy.
With this approach, patients who have negative
SLNB results carry a favorable prognosis and are
spared the morbidity of additional surgery or RT. A
recent study indicated that there was no significant
difference in 3-year recurrence-free survival among
patients with a negative SLNB between those who
did or did not receive adjuvant lymph node therapy.66 The best treatment for patients with micrometastatic MCC currently is unknown. CLND is the
most commonly reported treatment after a positive
SLNB with low rates of regional lymph node recurrence in several small published series.73,74,76 Successful treatment of the lymph node basin with RT
alone after a positive SLNB also has been reported.86
Failure to treat the lymph node basin after a positive
SLNB resulted in high recurrence rates in 2 small series.66,76
Based on the limited data available, low-level
evidence, and multidisciplinary consensus, CLND is
considered first-line treatment for most patients with
micrometastatic disease. When the morbidity of
CLND is deemed unacceptable by the patient or the
multidisciplinary tumor board, then RT to the lymph
node basin is considered as alternative therapy. For
patients who have extensive lymph node disease or
extracapsular lymph node extension in the SLN, adjuvant RT after CLND should be considered. SLNB is
not attempted if a patient is not able to undergo
additional therapy. The approach to patients with
palpable lymphadenopathy is identical to that
described for patients with micrometastatic disease.
On several occasions, we have identified a single
CK-20-positive cell or only rare CK-20-positive cells in
the SLN. The minimal tumor burden for which additional treatment is indicated is unknown. Reliable predictors of the rate of positivity of remaining lymph
nodes removed in a CLND after a positive SLNB have
yet to be determined. Patients with minute tumor burden are discussed by our multidisciplinary tumor
board on a case-by-case basis. Various therapeutic
options, including CLND, RT, and observation, are
considered. It is postulated that the SLNB may be therapeutic in patients who have minute tumor burden,
although to our knowledge no proof exists to date.

FIGURE 9. Algorithm for the management of Merkel cell carcinoma ( indicates with or without).

Chemotherapy is the least studied treatment modality for MCC, and the available data on its role,
particularly as adjuvant therapy, are limited. Several
studies have suggested a potential role for adjuvant
chemotherapy with or without RT in the treatment of
patients with high-risk, primary or regional MCC.87,88
However, a recent prospective study in which
patients with high-risk, localized disease received
synchronous radiochemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy using carboplatin and etoposide, failed to
demonstrate a survival benefit with the addition of
chemotherapy in a multivariate analysis.89 A retrospective subgroup analysis of 76 patients at MSKCC
also failed to reveal a survival benefit associated with
adjuvant chemotherapy.3 Given the significant morbidity associated with chemotherapeutic regimens,
particularly in the elderly MCC population, adjuvant
chemotherapy currently has no established role in
the treatment of localized or regional MCC. However,
several studies have reported complete or partial
resolution of in-transit MCC metastases with hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion using tumor necrosis factor a, interferon g, and/or melphalan.90,91

Distant disease
Numerous chemotherapeutic regimens similar to
those for patients with SCLC have been used in
patients with metastatic MCC or as primary therapy
for patients with inoperable disease.32,92 Most com-

monly, combination therapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and vincristine or with etoposide and platinum
have been used. MCC generally is considered a chemosensitive tumor with initial overall response rates
of approximately 60% to 70%. Small series have
achieved initial response rates of 100% with doxorubicin and cisplatin; 92% with 5-fluorouracil-containing regimens; and 76% with cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin/epirubicin, and vincristine. However, the
median duration of response is only 8 months. Moreover, the response rates of second-line and third-line
chemotherapy decrease to 45% and 20%, respectively.
Given the high but relatively short response rate, no
regimen clearly has demonstrated an impact on survival or response longevity in metastatic patients
with MCC, who have a median overall survival of 10
months. Because of the rarity of MCC, very few NCIsponsored trials currently are open for patients with
advanced disease.
A concern in the elderly population of patients
with MCC is the associated toxicity, primarily related
to myelosuppression. Skin toxicity with moist desquamation and tumor lysis syndrome with acute renal
failure requiring hemodialysis also have been reported.93,94 Despite a likely selection bias toward
patients who are deemed capable of tolerating chemotherapeutic regimens, a toxic death rate of 7.7% has
been reported in MCC.32 By comparison, among a
cohort of 1976 patients who received chemotherapy

10

CANCER July 1, 2007 / Volume 110 / Number 1

for various malignancies, only 12 deaths (0.6%)
directly related to chemotherapy were reported.95 Less
toxic chemotherapy regimens are possible, although
data suggest that this approach is less effective for elderly patients who have a good performance status.96
Therefore, initiation of treatment should not be based
solely on age. Combination chemotherapy of cisplatin
or carboplatin plus etoposide are reasonably effective
and tolerable treatments that should be considered for
all patients who have inoperable MCC and a good performance status.97 For second-line therapy or for
patients who are less fit, treatment with single-agent
topotecan, oral etoposide, irinotecan, taxanes, or
gemcitabine can be considered because of the demonstrated activity of these agents in advanced neuroendocrine tumors.98–100
The role of surgery in the treatment of patients
with distant metastatic MCC is limited and mostly palliative in nature. Metastasectomy rarely has been
reported for patients with a solitary distant metastasis.
Our knowledge of the biologic behavior of MCC
and the existing data to determine the optimal treatment for this disease are limited. However, as in
many other diseases for which we lack high-level evidence, treatment guidelines can and have been generated in an attempt to interpret the available data
for use in clinical practice.101 Based on a multidisciplinary interpretation of the existing evidence, our
current guidelines for the management of MCC are
summarized in Figure 9. Many questions remain
unanswered, and future data certainly will change
our understanding and management of this disease.
