tumor response (5), and the effects of modulating cellular levels of
dUTPase (Fig. 1) would seem to be consistent with the model (6, 7).
However, mammalian cells lacking the major replication-associated uracil-DNA glycosylase, Ung (8), do not show altered resistance
to FU (9), and Ung overexpression does not affect the sensitivity to
specific TS inhibitors (10). Thus, the model that FU killing is
mediated through inhibition of TS and increased incorporation of
uracil in DNA remains unsubstantiated.
FU is converted to several active metabolites (Fig. 1). In addition
to inhibiting TS, FU may exert its effects through incorporation of
the fluoronucleotide into RNA and disruption of RNA processing
(reviewed in ref. 1). FU is also incorporated into DNA following its
conversion to FdUTP, either via FdUMP or by reduction of the
ribonucleoside diphosphate. The introduction of FU into DNA via
the latter pathway may be unaffected by FdUMP-mediated
inhibition of TS (Fig. 1). dUTPase hydrolyses FdUTP as well as
dUTP (11), and the significance of FU incorporation in DNA has
been difficult to evaluate from the low levels measurable in drugtreated normal or tumor cells (12–15). Interestingly, both the
Ung and Smug1 uracil-DNA glycosylases have been reported to
excise FU from DNA in vitro (16). Smug1 is not found in lower
eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has only evolved
as a second uracil-DNA glycosylase in vertebrates (17), in which it
is nonredundant with the Ung enzyme in excising uracil or its
derivatives from the mammalian genome (8, 18, 19). Thus, FU
toxicity in S. cerevisiae would not be a relevant model for cancer
chemotherapy (20). Studies in mammalian cells show that FU
cytotoxicity is not mediated by Ung-initiated excision of uracil
from DNA (9) but have not addressed the role of Smug1. Here,
using gene-targeted cell lines defective in one or both of the
mammalian uracil-DNA glycosylases, for the first time, we were
able to show the contribution of FU incorporation in DNA to FU
cytotoxicity and the relevance of the Smug1 uracil-DNA glycosylase
in protecting against cell killing (Fig. 1).

Abstract
5-Fluorouracil (FU) has been widely used for more than four
decades in the treatment of a range of common cancers.
The fluorine-substituted uracil analogue is converted to
several active metabolites but the mechanism of cytotoxicity
has remained unclear. In a widely cited but unsubstantiated
model, FU is thought to kill cells via the inhibition of
thymidylate synthase and increased use of dUTP in place of
TTP during DNA replication, with subsequent excision of high
levels of uracil causing the fragmentation of newly synthesized
DNA. Using gene-targeted cell lines defective in one or both of
the two mammalian uracil-DNA glycosylase repair enzymes,
we were able to test this model of FU cytotoxicity. Here, we
show that incorporation of FU itself into DNA has been
previously underestimated and is a predominant cause of
cytotoxicity. FU readily becomes incorporated into the DNA of
drug-treated cells, and accumulation of FU in the genome,
rather than uracil excision, is correlated with FU cytotoxicity
in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the Smug1, but not the Ung,
uracil-DNA glycosylase excises FU from DNA and protects
against cell killing. The data provides a clearer understanding
of the action of FU, suggesting predictive biomarkers of drug
response and a mechanism for acquired resistance in tumors.

Introduction
5-Fluorouracil (FU) is widely used in the treatment of a range of
cancers, particularly colorectal cancer but also cancers of the
breast, head-and-neck, and aerodigestive tract (1). After four
decades in clinical use, FU or an oral prodrug (2) is presently used
in the treatment of some two million individuals a year (3).
The fluorine-substituted uracil analogue is an antimetabolite that
was designed to inhibit DNA synthesis in an early example of
the rational development of a cytotoxic drug (4). Inhibition
of thymidylate synthase (TS) by FdUMP prevents the conversion
of dUMP to the sole de novo source of dTMP (Fig. 1), depleting
the cell of dTTP for use in DNA replication and repair. This leads
to deoxynucleoside triphosphate precursor pool imbalances and
increased levels of dUTP. In a frequently proposed model,
FU-mediated cell death is attributed to the use of dUTP in place
of dTTP during DNA synthesis, and subsequent DNA fragmentation due to extensive uracil excision in newly synthesized DNA or
repeated futile repair attempts in the presence of a high dUTP/
dTTP ratio (reviewed in ref. 1). TS status has been correlated with

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The Ung / mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell line, isogenic
wild-type (Ung +/+) control, and stable small interfering RNA–mediated
knockdown of Smug1 in both a Ung +/+ (Smug1# cell line) and a Ung /
background (Smug1#, Ung / cell line) have been described (19). Cells were
cultured in DMEM/Ham’s F12 (3:1) with 10% fetal bovine serum.
High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of bases
released from the DNA of FU-treated cells by recombinant Smug1
and Ung. Exponentially growing cells (f107) were treated with FU-2-14C
(53 mCi mmol1; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), treated with nonradiolabeled FU and
labeled with uracil-2-14C (52 mCi mmol1; Sigma), or treated with
nonradiolabeled FU. The concentration of FU (and uracil) used was
10 Amol/L and cells were exposed to FU for 48 h (Vtwo cell divisions).
Genomic DNA was isolated from the cells (Wizard Genomic DNA
purification kit; Promega, Madison, WI) and 10 Ag 14C-labeled DNA or
15 Ag nonradiolabeled DNA was incubated with recombinant human
SMUG1 and UNG in standard enzyme reactions (see below). After incubation
at 37jC for 1 h, DNA was precipitated with ethanol and the supernatant

analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as described
previously (19). Fractions were collected at 0.5 min intervals, and released
DNA bases detected by scintillation counting or UV absorbance at 254 nm;
reference compounds were detected by UV absorbance.
In vitro DNA glycosylase assays. Standard uracil-DNA glycosylase assays
were carried out using recombinant human SMUG1 or UNG proteins in 20
mmol/L of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mmol/L of NaCl, 1 mmol/L of DTT,
1 mmol/L of EDTA, 100 Ag mL1 bovine serum albumin, 1 ng of AP
endonuclease, and 0.24 pmol of DNA substrate at 37jC for 1 h, as described
previously (19). The DNA substrate contained a centrally placed U:A or FU:A
base pair in the 5¶-32P-end–labeled strand of a 19-mer double-stranded
oligonucleotide. After the addition of 1 mol/L of piperidine and incubation at
90jC for 20 min, samples were dried under vacuum, denatured in 95%
formamide, and analyzed by 10% PAGE and phosphorimaging. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG-Biotech;1 the FU-containing oligonucleotide
was HPLC-purified and certified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
FU cell survival assays. Exponentially growing cells plated in triplicate
in 100 mm dishes were treated at a range of drug doses with FU or
fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), and surviving colonies were scored after 10 to
12 days in culture (as a percentage of the untreated control and after
adjustment for plating efficiency), essentially as described (19). Where cells
were supplemented with thymidine, 100 Amol/L of thymidine was given
along with 1 Amol/L of deoxycytidine (21). FU, FUdR, and thymidine were
obtained from Sigma.
Generation of stable Smug1-overexpressing MEF cell lines. The
murine Smug1 open reading frame (837 bp; ref. 17) was cloned under the
control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pTARGET Mammalian
Expression System (Promega). The construct was linearized with ScaI and
transfected into the wild-type MEF cell line using Polyfect Transfection
Reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). G418-resistant colonies were isolated
following culture in 1.4 mg mL1 of G418 and the level of Smug1 expression
was assayed by quantitative real-time PCR of reverse-transcribed total RNA,
as described previously (19). Colonies showing elevated Smug1 mRNA levels
were subcultured for three to four passages in G418, and Smug1 expression
was re-assessed and confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies against
human SMUG1 (17).

line (8) and stable small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown of
Smug1 (Smug1# ) in both the Ung / and Ung +/+ background (19).
In order to determine whether FU is incorporated and persists in
the DNA of drug-treated uracil-DNA glycosylase-deficient cells, the
Ung / cell line, Smug1# and Smug1#, Ung / cell lines were
exposed to 14C-labeled FU, genomic DNA was isolated from live
cells after 48 h of FU exposure, and samples were digested with
recombinant Smug1 and Ung. Radiolabeled ethanol-soluble products released by the recombinant proteins were then resolved by
HPLC and identified by comparison with reference compounds
(Fig. 2A). HPLC analysis resolved a small discrete peak of
radioactive material in DNA from wild-type cells that was
coincident with a FU marker; a similar small peak of 14C-FU was
detected in Ung / cells. This corresponded to 1.5  105 FU
residues per diploid genome in both wild-type and Ung / cells
(Table 1). In marked contrast, a large peak of 14C-FU was detected
in DNA from both the Smug1# and Smug1#, Ung / cell lines,
corresponding to 4.3  106 and 3.2  106 FU residues per diploid
genome, respectively (Table 1); a slightly lower level of FU
incorporated in the double mutant may reflect the slower doubling
time of this cell line (data not shown) and the limited labeling
period. The data shows that there is substantial incorporation of
FU in the DNA of drug-treated cells, with no effect of Ung
deficiency on FU levels but a 20- to 30-fold increase in the level of
FU in the genome of Smug1-deficient cells (Fig. 2A; Table 1); this is
equivalent to the substitution of f1 in 500 thymine residues.
Similar experiments were conducted in which cells were treated
with the same molar concentration of FU as above but this was
nonradiolabeled; cells were instead labeled with 14C-uracil in order
to examine the levels of uracil incorporated into the DNA. These
experiments showed that uracil accumulates in cellular DNA of FUtreated cells, but to a lesser degree than FU (Fig. 2B), and in wildtype cells, there were 8.2  104 uracil residues per diploid genome
(Table 1). However, unlike FU in DNA, uracil levels were affected by
the loss of either Ung or Smug1. Thus, there was an increase of
uracil in DNA in Ung / as well as Smug1# cells, and an additive
10-fold increase (8.2  105 uracil residues per diploid genome) in
the double mutant. The accumulated level of uracil was 3- to 4-fold
less than that of FU in the Smug1#, Ung / cell line (Table 1),
representing the substitution of f1 in 2,000 thymine residues. Both

FU and U were also detected, by UV absorbance in comparison
with known quantities of reference standards, in Smug1#, Ung /
cells treated with nonradiolabeled FU, and were present at levels
equivalent to those observed in radiolabeling experiments (Fig. 2C).
When total RNA as well as genomic DNA was isolated from
duplicate samples of FU-treated cells, the ratio of 14C-FU
(cpm Ag1) incorporated into RNA/DNA in the wild-type and
Ung / cell lines was f11:1, in agreement with other studies (15),
and this ratio was reduced in the Smug1# and Smug1#, Ung / cell
lines, consistent with increased levels of FU in the DNA of Smug1deficient cells (data not shown). Our data indicate that whereas
both Smug1 and Ung excise uracil incorporated in U:A base pairs
in vivo, the Smug1 uracil-DNA glycosylase—but not Ung—excises
FU arising through the use of FdUTP instead of dTTP during DNA
synthesis (Fig. 1).
In vitro DNA repair assays. In vitro, the Ung and Smug1 uracilDNA glycosylases efficiently excise uracil from U:A base pairs in

nucleosomes as well as in naked DNA (22). Both enzymes have also
been reported to excise FU from DNA in vitro (16). In light of our
data demonstrating the accumulation of FU in the DNA of Smug1but not Ung-deficient cells, repair assays were conducted to
examine the FU-excision activity of Smug1 and Ung in vitro. We
assayed the relative activity of each enzyme on a double-stranded
oligonucleotide substrate containing a centrally placed FU:A or a
U:A base pair. Both enzymes are considerably less active on a
FU:A–containing versus a U:A–containing substrate but, whereas
Ung activity is z100 reduced, Smug1 activity is only f10
reduced on a FU:A versus U:A base pair (Fig. 3). FU:A excision
activity could not be detected in wild-type cell-free extracts (data
not shown) so it was not possible to assess the contribution of
Smug1 and Ung to the total cellular FU-excision activity. However,
the greatly reduced activity of recombinant Ung on FU:A versus U:A
in vitro (Fig. 3) correlates with the failure of Ung to contribute to
FU repair in vivo (Fig. 2A; Table 1). Conversely, the much more
robust activity of recombinant Smug1 on FU:A base pairs is
consistent with the accumulation of FU in the DNA of Smug1deficient FU-treated cells and the conclusion that Smug1 excises
FU incorporated into FU:A DNA base pairs in vivo.
Sensitivity of Smug1-deficient cell lines to FU killing. In
order to determine whether the observed accumulation of FU in
the genome of Smug1-deficient cells had any effect on cell
viability, we compared the sensitivity of the Smug1# and Smug1#,
Ung / MEF cell lines to FU killing, with that of the Ung / cell
line and wild-type control. Smug1-deficiency significantly altered
the cellular response to FU (Fig. 4A) and the Smug1# cell line was
f2-fold more sensitive to FU (D 37 = 3.2 Amol/L) than the wildtype control (D 37 = 6.8 Amol/L; D 37 is the drug dose that results
in 37% cell survival). In agreement with previous data (9), there
was no significant difference in survival of the Ung / cell line
treated with FU in comparison with the wild-type control.
Furthermore, there was no additive effect due to loss of Ung, with
Smug1#, Ung / cells showing the same sensitivity as the Smug1#
cell line. The relative sensitivity of the four cell lines to killing
by FU correlates with the levels of FU measured in cellular DNA;
it does not correlate with the levels of uracil in DNA (Fig. 2A;
Table 1). FU in DNA was measured after 48 h treatment of cell
lines with 10 Amol/L of 14C-FU (Fig. 2A); this same drug dose
resulted in 13.5% versus 4.2% survival of wild-type and Smug1#
cells, respectively (Fig. 4A). Thus, the persistence of FU in DNA,
rather than the excision of uracil, is the predominant means of

real-time PCR and verified by Western blotting with Smug1-specific
antibodies. Two sublines expressing f1.5 and f2.5 the wildtype level of Smug1 protein were assayed for cellular sensitivity to
FU in comparison with the parental wild-type line (Fig. 5). There
was a significantly increased resistance to FU in the cell line
expressing f2.5 Smug1 protein relative to the wild-type parental
line (D 37 ratio 1.7:1).

Discussion
We have shown that the Smug1 DNA glycosylase excises FU from
DNA in vivo; extensive accumulation of FU in the genome of
Smug1-deficient cells sensitizes them to FU killing, providing direct
proof that FU incorporated in DNA is cytotoxic (Fig. 1). The level of
FU in DNA measured here in wild-type cells is comparable to early
reports for normal or tumor cell lines in which the occurrence of
FU in DNA was first described (12–15). However, the extent to
which FU becomes incorporated in DNA and its relevance to FU
cytotoxicity is only revealed here in a Smug1-deficient cell line
(Fig. 2A). There is an appreciable level of FU in DNA even in the
presence of Smug1 (Table 1), and it seems likely that this would
also contribute to the toxicity of FU in wild-type cells. Consistent
with this, a modest f2.5-fold increase in the level of Smug1 protein

FU-mediated cell killing. Our data show that accumulation of FU
in DNA is cytotoxic and base excision repair of FU initiated by
Smug1 protects cells from FU killing.
As with FU, Smug1# and Smug1#, Ung / cells treated with
FUdR showed significantly increased sensitivity to the fluoropyrimidine, whereas there was again no marked difference in the
survival of Ung / versus wild-type cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, Smug1deficient cells (D 37 = 11.6 Amol/L) were f2-fold more sensitive to
FUdR than wild-type cells (D 37 = 20.8 Amol/L). This indicates that
FU is introduced into the DNA by treatment with FUdR as well
as FU, and hypersensitivity of Smug1# cells to FUdR is, as with
FU treatment, due to the deficiency in Smug1-initiated base
excision repair of FU incorporated in place of thymine in DNA. The
cell is able to synthesize dTMP de novo via a nonessential salvage
pathway catalyzed by thymidine kinase, bypassing the effects of TS
inhibition and restoring the dTTP pool; due to the allosteric
regulation of deoxynucleoside triphosphate synthesis, cells were
supplemented with thymidine as well as a trace of deoxycytidine
(21). Thymidine supplementation may not affect the use of FdUTP
in DNA synthesis (Fig. 1). Consistent with this, supplementing
FUdR-treated cells with thymidine decreased the sensitivity of all
four cell lines but Smug1# cells still remained more sensitive than
Ung / and wild-type cells (Fig. 4B).
Both wild-type and Smug1-deficient cell lines were 3- to 4-fold more
sensitive to killing by FU than FUdR (note different dose ranges on the
X-axes in Fig. 4A and B), and although thymidine supplementation
also proportionately decreased the sensitivity of both cell lines to FU, it
was less effective in rescuing FU-treated compared with FUdR-treated
cells (data not shown). These data indicate that FU-mediated killing of
wild-type cells is predominantly due to active metabolites that are
preferentially produced from FU rather than FUdR; these are likely to
be the RNA and DNA precursors, FUTP and FdUTP, rather than the
TS-inhibitory FdUMP (Fig. 1).
Overexpression of Smug1 protects cells against FU-mediated
cell killing. We have shown that FU incorporation in DNA is a
predominant means of FU-mediated cell killing and that cells
deficient in DNA base excision repair of FU by Smug1 are sensitized
to cell killing. We therefore investigated whether overexpression
of Smug1 in wild-type cells might increase cellular resistance to FU
killing. A construct expressing murine Smug1 under the control of
the cytomegalovirus promoter was transfected into the wild-type
MEF cell line. Sublines were established that stably expressed
moderately elevated levels of Smug1, as ascertained by quantitative

overcome TS-inhibition and restore the dTTP pool (Fig. 1) only
partially rescued FU-treated wild-type cells and did not reduce the
hypersensitivity of Smug1-deficient cells to either FU or FUdR, as
the use of FdUTP in DNA synthesis remained unaltered.
It is presently unclear why FU in DNA is cytotoxic. We cannot
formally exclude the possibility that FU bases themselves are
benign substitutions in DNA but that instead a small proportion
are converted to a highly toxic lesion in situ. However, massive
substitution of f1 in 500 thymine residues with FU in the genome
of Smug1-deficient cells (Table 1) would itself be expected to affect
fundamental processes, such as the transcription of essential genes
or the establishment of the chromatin structure, by altering DNA
dynamics in A:T–rich regions (25, 26) or interfering with proteinDNA interactions (27). Such processes might also be compromised
if there were nonproductive binding to FU residues in DNA by
another DNA repair/processing enzyme. Mismatch repair (28), and
the MBD4 and TDG mismatch-specific DNA glycosylases (29, 30),
have also been reported to act on FU in vitro but in the context of a
FU:G mispair; use of FdUTP during DNA synthesis typically gives
rise to an FU:A base pair (25) but rare mutagenic FU:G mispairs
could theoretically arise in vivo (26, 31). In contrast to Smug1deficient cells, and by an as yet unexplained mechanism, Mbd4 /
MEFs (29), and mismatch repair–defective cell lines and tumors
(28) are apparently resistant to FU. Thus, rare FU:G base pairs
might arise upon replication of FU:A–containing DNA and be
abortively processed by mismatch repair or a mismatch-specific
DNA glycosylase. Elevated levels of FU in DNA did not seem to be
associated with increased DNA fragmentation in FU-treated
Smug1-deficient cells (data not shown). TDG, which is a very
minor uracil-excision activity compared with UNG or SMUG1 (8),
has been reported to act on FU:A in vitro (30); if this is relevant
in vivo and whether ablation of Tdg might modify the effect of
Smug1-deficiency remains to be determined.
Our data show that the introduction of FU into DNA and its
contribution to FU-mediated cell killing has been previously
underestimated. This is particularly relevant as formation of
FdUTP and its use in DNA synthesis seems to occur irrespective
of TS inhibition and the level of the TTP pool in FU-treated cells
(Fig. 4), being more clearly correlated with ribonucleotide
metabolism and dependent on the activity of ribonucleotide
reductase converting FUDP to FdUDP (Fig. 1). The relationship
of FU in DNA to both the strategy and efficacy of FU treatment in
patients should be further evaluated (2, 3, 32). Our data shows that
even a 2- to 3-fold increase in Smug1 protein significantly increases
the resistance of FU-treated cells to killing, such that Smug1 upregulation could provide a previously unrecognized mechanism of
acquired drug resistance in tumors. This may be particularly
relevant where FU is used in combination with radiotherapy (3), as
Smug1 also helps protect cells against killing by low-level ionizing
radiation (19). Gene products identified to date as markers of FU
resistance have invariably been involved in metabolizing the drug
or modulating TS inhibition, rather than directly in repairing FU
DNA damage (Fig. 1), but it would now seem pertinent to analyze
the Smug1 enzyme during prolonged FU exposure and in gene
expression profiles of FU-resistant tumors (33, 34).

Figure 5. Overexpression of SMUG1 increases the FU-resistance of
wild-type cells. A wild-type MEF cell line (n), and stable transfected clones
overexpressing recombinant SMUG1 protein, at f2.5-fold (.) or f1.5-fold (o)
wild-type levels, were treated with FU at the doses indicated and surviving
colonies scored (as a percentage of the untreated control), as in Fig. 4.

significantly increased the resistance of FU-treated cells to killing.
Thus, the excision of FU from DNA by Smug1 may be relatively
inefficient, in agreement with the limited FU excision capacity
observed in normal mammalian cells (23). We have shown in
in vitro assays that Ung has greatly reduced activity on FU:A versus
U:A base pairs, which would explain why Ung does not contribute
to FU repair in vivo. Furthermore, as Ung but not Smug1 is sorted
to the mitochondria as well as the nucleus (24), this would leave
the mitochondrial genome vulnerable to incorporated FU and a
possible target of FU toxicity in wild-type cells. SMUG1 is able to
excise uracil derivatives with substitutions at the C5 position of the
pyrimidine ring, as the aromatic residue that forms a steric barrier
to binding of C5-modified bases in UNG is not conserved in the
active site structure of SMUG1 (18). Our data are consistent with
this, demonstrating considerably less discrimination by Smug1
than Ung against FU:A versus U:A base pairs in vitro, and the
contribution of Smug1 but not Ung to FU repair in vivo (Fig. 4).
Smug1-deficient cells are sensitized to killing by FU, with no
effect of Ung on FU survival. Thus, FU cytotoxicity is directly
correlated with the loss of Smug1 FU-excision activity and greatly
increased levels of FU in DNA. The accumulation of uracil in the
DNA of Smug1# cells as well as Ung / cells, with an up to 10-fold
increase in the Smug1#, Ung / double mutant, was not correlated
with FU survival. As Smug1#, Ung / cells lacking uracil-DNA
glycosylase activity are sensitized to killing, the data clearly oppose
a model in which FU toxicity is due to the excision of uracil from
DNA. Our data do not directly address whether specific inhibition
of TS kills cells due to elevation of the dUTP precursor pool
and associated base excision repair of uracil in DNA, but the FU
hypersensitivity of Smug1# cells versus unaltered resistance of
Ung / cells shows that use of FdUTP in DNA synthesis rather than
FdUMP-mediated inhibition of TS is the predominant mechanism
by which FU kills cells. Consistent with this, all MEF lines here were
considerably less sensitive to FUdR than to FU, as has been
described for other murine and human cell lines (15). FUdR would
be expected to exert its effects primarily through TS inhibition, as
FUdR is converted directly to FdUMP, whereas the conversion of FU
to FUMP allows incorporation in RNA but also DNA via reduction
of the ribonucleoside diphosphate, which would be unaffected by
TS inhibition (Fig. 1). Thus, supplementing cells with thymidine to
