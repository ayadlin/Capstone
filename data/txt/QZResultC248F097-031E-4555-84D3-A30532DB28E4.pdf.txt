ABSTRACT
Metastasis is a major cause of mortality for cancer patients and remains as the
greatest challenge in cancer therapy. Driven by multiple factors, metastasis may not
be controlled by the inhibition of single target. This study was aimed at assessing the
hypothesis that drugs could be rationally combined to co-target critical DNA, RNA and
protein molecules to achieve “saturation attack” against metastasis. Independent
actions of the model drugs DNA-intercalating doxorubicin, RNA-interfering miR34a and protein-inhibiting sorafenib on DNA replication, RNA translation and
protein kinase signaling in highly metastatic, human osteosarcoma 143B cells were
demonstrated by the increase of γH2A.X foci formation, reduction of c-MET expression
and inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, respectively, and optimal effects were
found for triple-drug combination. Consequently, triple-drug treatment showed a
strong synergism in suppressing 143B cell proliferation and the greatest effects in
reducing cell invasion. Compared to single- and dual-drug treatment, triple-drug
therapy suppressed pulmonary metastases and orthotopic osteosarcoma progression
to significantly greater degrees in orthotopic osteosarcoma xenograft/spontaneous
metastases mouse models, while none showed significant toxicity. In addition, tripledrug therapy improved the overall survival to the greatest extent in experimental
metastases mouse models. These findings demonstrate co-targeting of DNA, RNA and
protein molecules as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

locally destructive mesenchymal tumor accounting for
60% of malignant bone tumors among children and
young adults, has a predilection for lung metastases [46]. Improved therapies for OS have increased the 5-year
survival rate to 60-70% for non-metastatic OS of the
extremities [7-9], dramatically extending the life span of

Metastasis remains a major cause of death of
cancer patients. Approximately 90% of cancer-associated
mortality arises from systemic metastasis of the primary
tumor [1-3]. As an example, osteosarcoma (OS), a primary

childhood OS survivors. However, the 5-years survival
rate is only 18-33% for those with lung metastases at the
time of diagnosis [9-11]. Overall 80% of OS patients die
from distant metastases, most commonly in the lungs [9].
The processes such as invasion from the primary
site, circulation of tumor-initiating cells, metastatic
colonization, and distant outgrowth of metastases
underlying cancer invasion-metastasis cascade are very
complex [1-3]. While some molecular determinants
and signaling pathways (e.g., c-MET, VEGF, Ras-RafMAPK-ERK pathways, etc.) behind cancer metastatic
processes have been identified, much remains poorly
understood. Furthermore, the presence of redundant
signaling pathways and the emergence of complementary
mechanisms and resistant phenotypes limit the efficacy of
targeted anti-neoplastic therapies. Therefore, combating
metastasis remains one of the greatest challenges in cancer
therapy [3, 12] and blocking single target or pathway is
unlikely to be very effective.
We recently established a novel platform for highyield production of biologic RNA-interfering (RNAi)
agents including miRNAs and siRNAs [13, 14] that are
distinguished from commonly used synthetic RNAi
reagents carrying extensive artificial modifications [15].
We also demonstrated that biologic miR-34a prodrug was
precisely processed to mature miR-34a and thus effective
to regulate target gene expression (e.g., c-MET) [14, 16].
In addition, combination therapy with miR-34a prodrug
and doxorubicin exerted synergistic effects in repressing
human OS cell growth via RNA interference and DNA
intercalation, and this combination is more effective than
monotherapy in suppressing OS xenograft tumor growth
[17].
To explore new strategy for the treatment of
metastasis, we hypothesized that optimal outcomes
might be achieved through “saturation attack”, i.e.,
co-targeting of DNA, and particular RNA and protein
molecules (Figure 1A) critical for almost all cancer
cellular processes. To test the hypothesis, we employed
DNA-intercalating doxorubicin, RNA-interfering miR34a, and protein kinase-inhibiting sorafenib as model
drugs and assessed their independent and complementary
actions in highly metastatic, human OS 143B model cells.
Doxorubicin is one of the chemotherapeutic agents (i.e.,
methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin; sometimes with
ifosfamide) that are currently used for the treatment of
soft tissue sarcomas [7]. Since VEGFR and Raf/MEK/
ERK signaling pathways have been reported to be relevant
to OS progression [18-20], sorafenib was chosen as a
protein kinase-inhibiting model drug. Because miR-34a
is significantly downregulated in human OS tissues [18,
19] and reintroduction of miR-34a into OS cells inhibits
cell proliferation and suppresses tumorigenesis [20, 21],
miR-34a was selected as an RNA-interfering agent. In
addition, the biologic miR-34a prodrug used in this study
was produced and folded in live cells [13, 14], which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is distinguished from synthetic miRNA agents bearing
extensive artificial modifications [15, 22]. As a result,
the combined drugs showed a strong synergism and the
greatest effects in suppressing OS cell proliferation and
invasion. In spontaneous and experimental metastasis
mouse models, rational triple-drug combination therapy
elicited the most beneficial outcomes, as manifested
by the highest degrees of suppression of orthotopic
OS progression and pulmonary metastases, as well as
improvement of survival.

RESULTS
Independent and combined actions of
doxorubicin, sorafenib and miR-34a on target
molecules in metastatic 143B cells
To test the concept of co-targeting of critical DNA,
RNA and protein molecules in metastatic cancer cells
(Figure 1A), we first examined the effects of model drugs
doxorubicin, miR-34a and sorafenib on corresponding
targets and marker proteins in OS 143B cells and
defined their interactions when used in combination. An
immunofluorescent study was carried out to investigate
γH2A.X foci formation, which is a sensitive and robust
biomarker of DNA damage [23] induced by DNAintercalating drugs and may indicate the mechanistic
actions of doxorubicin. Compared to 143B cells treated
with vehicle, sorafenib plus miR-34a treatment did
not alter γH2A.X signal intensity while doxorubicin
alone sharply induced the damage of DNA (Figure 1B).
Moreover, co-administration of sorafenib and miR-34a,
alone or together, with doxorubicin sharply increased
the levels of γH2A.X. The highest levels were observed
in cells treated with doxorubicin plus miR-34a, with or
without sorafenib (Figure 1B). The same results were
obtained by Western blot analyses of γH2A.X (data not
shown), indicating that sorafenib or miR-34a alone or
combined does not alter γH2A.X foci formation but is able
to largely enhance doxorubicin-provoked DNA damage in
143B cells.
Western blots were performed to verify the effects
of miR-34a and sorafenib as well as combinatorial
effects in 143B cells (Figure 1C). Compared to vehicle
treatment, miR-34a led to a 40% suppression of c-MET
protein levels, a well-defined miR-34a target [24-26]
being involved in osteosarcoma metastasis [27-29]. To
our surprise, either doxorubicin or sorafenib alone or in
combination led to an upregulation of c-MET. However,
co-administration of miR-34a abrogated the increase of
c-MET expression caused by doxorubicin and sorafenib
(Figure 1C). Likewise, the inhibitory effects of sorafenib
on protein kinases [30-32] were indicated by an 80%
reduction in phosphorylation of target Erk1/2, as revealed
30743

by Western blot analyses of p-Erk1/2 (Figure 1C). While
doxorubicin and miR-34a alone caused ~20% inhibition of
p-Erk1/2 levels, triple-drug combination reduced p-Erk1/2
to a comparable level as sorafenib alone, which might had
reached a saturation point. Together, the results confirmed
the independent actions of doxorubicin, sorafenib
and miR-34a in 143B cells as well as the ultimate
combinatorial effects.

activities of individual drugs and various combinations.
As expected, doxorubicin, sorafenib and miR-34a prodrug
alone reduced the proliferation of 143B cells in a dosedependent manner, and a dual- or triple-drug combination
was more effective than individual agents (Figure 2A-2F).
Interestingly, the anti-proliferation effects of sorafenib
and miR-34a combination were mainly additive or even
antagonistic at lower concentrations. In contrast, coadministration of doxorubicin with sorafenib or miR-34a
or sorafenib plus miR-34a produced synergistic effects
in suppressing the proliferation of 143B cells, where
the synergism of triple-drug combination persisted at
all concentrations (Figure 2F). Therefore, combination
therapy could offer remarkable degrees of dose reduction,
especially for doxorubicin and miR-34a prodrug, to
achieve the same levels of anti-proliferation effects
(Supplementary Figure S1A-D). For instance, an 80%

inhibition requires approximately 25 nM miR-34a alone or
160 nM doxorubicin alone or 10,000 nM sorafenib alone,
whereas only 4 nM miR-34a plus 40 nM doxorubicin
and 4,000 nM sorafenib in the triple-drug combination
(Figure 2A-D). Moreover, there was a stronger synergism
and much greater extent of dose reduction for doxorubicin
at higher degrees of cell inhibition (e.g., > 75%) when
used with miR-34a or sorafenib or both, which would
ultimately lessen or eradicate the risk of toxicity that might
be induced by high doses of doxorubicin.

destruction and metastasis of tumors. Our results showed
that miR-34a alone suppressed the invasion capability
of 143B cells by about 50%, and doxorubicin plus
sorafenib reduced cell invasion by 74%, as compared to
the vehicle control. Furthermore, triple-drug combination
with doxorubicin, sorafenib and miR-34a led to over
90% suppression of cell invasiveness, a significantly
greater degree than miR-34a prodrug or doxorubicin plus
sorafenib (Figure 2H). The results demonstrate that tripledrug combination was the most effective to block the
invasion ability of highly metastatic 143B cells.

effectiveness of rationally-designed triple-drug therapy in
the suppression of xenograft tumor growth (Figure 3) and
reduction of spontaneous pulmonary metastases (Figure
4). The sizes of orthotopic xenograft osteosarcomas were
monitored over time through bioluminescence imaging
and by caliper. Our data showed that every drug treatment
could significantly inhibit the outgrowth of viable
xenograft osteosarcomas than vehicle control, albeit to
different degrees, as manifested by bioluminescence
intensities (Figure 3B) and calculated tumor volumes
(Figure 3C). The degrees of suppression by triple-drug
therapy were significantly greater than sorafenib plus
either doxorubicin or miR-34a treatment (Figure 3C).
Although statistical significance was not reached when
triple-drug therapy group was compared to doxorubicin

plus miR-34a treatment, the greatest extent of repression
of osteosarcoma progression by triple therapy was obvious
(Figure 3C). The consistent tendency was also indicated
by visual inspection of dissected xenograft osteosarcomas
(Figure 3D) and quantitative measurement (Figure 3E) of
tumor weights.
To evaluate the effects of individual treatments
on pulmonary metastases, lung tissues were dissected
from all mice and GFP-expressing tumors were imaged.
As demonstrated by ex vivo GFP signals including the
distributions and intensities (Figure 4A), triple-drug
combination therapy showed a much greater suppression
of pulmonary metastases. We thus randomly selected four
samples from each group for histopathological analyses,
among which triple therapy group consistently showed

the least lung metastases (Figure 4B). Specifically, the
numbers of metastases per lung sample were much less in
triple-drug therapy groups (1-4 foci of metastases in each
lung) than vehicle control group (9-34 foci) (Figure 4C).
In addition, the sum of the longest diameters of metastasis
foci in triple-drug therapy group as well as doxorubicin/
miR-34a treatment group was significantly smaller
than vehicle control (Figure 4D). Together, the results
demonstrated that triple-drug therapy using doxorubicin,
miR-34a and sorafenib provided the greatest degrees of
protection against orthotopic osteosarcoma progression
and pulmonary metastases.

was more obvious in doxorubicin-treated groups (Figure
5A) and might indicate some doxorubicin-associated
toxicity. However, all mice did not show any signs of stress
such as hunched posture or labored movement. After fiveday recovery showing gain of body weights (Figure 5A),
the second course of treatment was initiated with slightly
reduced drug doses to avoid any potential adverse effects.
After this treatment, all mice including those treated with
vehicle showed 5-10% loss of body weights (Figure 5A),
likely due to the progression of osteosarcoma (Figure 3),
severe metastases burden (Figure 4) and/or handling rather
than drug treatment. There was actually one mouse in the
vehicle treatment group that showed the greatest degree
of body weight loss at the last week of study, which was
mainly attributable to cancer-associated cachexia resulting
from advanced osteosarcoma.
To examine the risk of hepatic and renal toxicities,
serum samples were collected and subjected to blood
chemistry profiling (Figure 5B-5F). Levels of alanine

an artificial pulmonary metastases mouse model via
intravenous injection of 143B OS cells (Figure 6A).
Metastases were confirmed to be visible on the surface of
all mouse lung tissues at about 2 weeks post-inoculation
in our pilot study. Therefore, we started the treatment
with vehicle, miR-34a, doxorubicin/sorafenib, and the
triple-drug combination on day 13 post-inoculation
(Figure 6A). The survival study was terminated on day
70 when all mice treated with vehicle or doxorubicin/
sorafenib died (Figure 6B). The presence of extensive
pulmonary metastases after death or euthanasia was
verified by necropsy and histological analyses (Figure
6C). Furthermore, extrapulmonary metastases (e.g., skull,
jaw, shoulder, knee or/and caudal vertebra) were noted in
3 mice among each group treated with vehicle, miR-34a
or doxorubicin plus sorafenib, in contrast to 2 mice treated
with triple-drug combination.
While doxorubicin plus sorafenib therapy or miR34a alone significantly increased the overall survival
and improved the median survival from 38 days to 54
days, triple-drug combination therapy improved the
overall survival to a more significant level and extended
the median survival to an even longer time (60.5 days;

aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), total bilirubin, both blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and
creatinine concentrations were all variable in individual
treatment groups but within the normal ranges (except
the cachectic mouse described above), the latter of which
indicates the absence of liver and kidney toxicity. In
addition, serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels [33] were
examined using an ELISA assay for the assessment of risk
of doxorubicin-associated myocardial damage. Our data
showed that cTnI levels in control and treatment groups
were all under the lower limit of quantification (0.156 ng/
ml), suggesting the lack of cardiac toxicity. Together, these
results indicated that therapeutic doses of doxorubicin,
sorafenib and miR-34a prodrug alone or in combination
were well tolerated in these mice.

identified (Figure 6C). These results demonstrated that

strategy to combat metastasis, which utilizes multiple
drugs to co-target DNA, mRNA and protein molecules
critical for many cellular processes. The benefits of
“saturation attack” were strikingly obvious, given
the greatest degrees in the suppression of orthotopic
osteosarcoma progression and lung metastases, as well as
improvement of survival in spontaneous and experimental
metastases mouse models, which were attributable to the
independent and complementary or combined actions of
model drugs on DNA replication, mRNA translation, and

an effective means to fight against metastatic cancers [12].
Nevertheless, present combination therapies all focus on
the co-inhibition of protein targets. For instance, the first
immune checkpoint inhibitor combination approved by
FDA in October, 2015 for the treatment of unresectable

could largely enhance doxorubicin-provoked DNA damage
in 143B cells. By contrast, the reduction of pErk1/2 levels
by sorafenib alone seemed to reach the maximal effects
as the addition of doxorubicin and miR-34a did not show
any impact. Consistent with the upregulation of c-MET in
ovarian and hepatocellular carcinoma cells by doxorubicin
and sorafenib that may be linked to drug resistance [37,
38], our data revealed higher levels of c-MET in OS
cells treated with doxorubicin and sorafenib, alone or in
combination. However, the inclusion of c-MET mRNAtargeting miR-34a completely erased such negative impact
of doxorubicin and sorafenib, highlighting the benefits of
independent and complementary actions of rationallycombined DNA-intercalating, RNA-interfering, and
protein-inhibiting drugs.
The strong synergism of doxorubicin, sorafenib
and miR-34a allowed high degrees of dose reduction of
individual drugs to achieve the same level of efficacy
(e.g., Fa = 0.8). This is of particular important for
chemotherapeutic doxorubicin and RNAi drug miR-34a,
which at higher doses might induce cardiotoxicity and
immune responses, respectively. As a result, relatively
lower doses of individual drugs, alone or in combination,
were utilized to evaluate saturation attack strategy in the
mouse model of pulmonary metastases from orthotopic
OS xenografts, which resembles the clinical features of
human OS for the evaluation of new therapeutic strategies
[3, 39]. Besides the body weight loss caused by severe
tumor burden (vehicle control), drug-associated body
weight loss was noted but acceptable in all treatment
groups. Furthermore, the drug-/injection-induced body
weight was restorable after withdrawal. All mice showed
normal blood chemistry profiles, except for one mouse
in the vehicle control group with cancer-related cachexia
and abnormal blood BUN and creatinine levels, indicating
that therapeutic doses of doxorubicin, sorafenib and
bioengineered miR-34a prodrug were well tolerated in
tumor-bearing mice without causing any liver or kidney
toxicity. In addition, no mice showed any cardiac injury,
as determined by the levels of cTnIs. This may be due to
the use of much lower doses of doxorubicin in the present
study, although it is unknown if co-administration of
miR-34a prodrug would give rise to asymptomatic heart
dysfunction of doxorubicin plus sorafenib [40].
The benefits of triple-drug therapy via co-targeting
DNA, RNA and protein molecules were notably
demonstrated by the greatest level of efficacy in the
spontaneous metastases mouse models. Compared to
vehicle control, single drug treatment offered a lower
degree of suppression of orthotopic OS xenograft tumor
growth and showed insignificant effects on pulmonary
metastases. In addition to consistent findings on the
effectiveness of doxorubicin chemotherapy plus miR34a replacement therapy on OS xenograft tumor growth
[17], present study revealed much greater degrees of
suppression by the combination of doxorubicin plus
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sorafenib, and sorafenib plus miR-34a than single drug
treatment. Furthermore, co-administration of doxorubicin
and miR-34a significantly suppressed lung metastases
in these mice although the combinations of sorafenib
plus miR-34a and doxorubicin plus sorafenib only had
modest effects. Most importantly, the greatest degree of
suppression of orthotopic OS xenograft tumor growth
and pulmonary metastases were identified in mice treated
with triple-drug combination. The optimal therapeutic
outcomes from saturation attack observed in vivo are also
consistent with the synergistic effects in the control of cell
proliferation and the blockage of invasiveness identified
in vitro.
The present study further revealed the benefit of
triple-drug therapy in experimental metastasis mouse
model, as indicated by the extents of improvement
of survival. Consistent with the encouraging results
of doxorubicin plus sorafenib therapy for advanced
HCC patients [40], dual-drug combination was able to
significantly improve the survival of pulmonary metastatic
mice. Furthermore, two cycles of monotherapy with
bioengineered miR-34a prodrug significantly improved the
survival rate of mice. This is in agreement with sufficient
distribution of in vivo-jetPEI-encapsulated miR-34a
prodrug to mouse lung tissues (unpublished data) and
the actions of miR-34a on multiple therapeutic targets
including PD-L1 implicated in immunotherapy [41, 42].
The triple-drug combination therapy enhanced mouse
survival rate to the most significant level, which was also
indicated by the longest median survival. The absence of
statistical differences between triple-drug combination
therapy and miR-34a alone or doxorubicin/sorafenib is
likely due to a quite heavy burden of lung metastases
in the experimental animal models and relatively small
sample size in each group.
In summary, we have demonstrated that a rational
triple-drug combination therapy can offer robust and
optimal outcomes in spontaneous and experimental
metastases mouse models, as manifested by the
greatest degrees of suppression of tumor progression
and metastasis as well as extension of overall survival.
Independent and combined actions of model drugs
doxorubicin, miR-34a and sorafenib on the inhibition
of DNA replication, RNA translation and protein signal
transduction are indicated by the increase of γH2A.X,
decrease of c-MET expression and reduction of ERK1/2
phosphorylation, respectively. Although the identification
of optimal dose regimens for direct clinical application
will be challenging, rational combination therapy offers
obvious synergism and permits the use of much lower and
safe doses of drugs. Our findings suggest that co-targeting
critical DNA, RNA and protein molecules may provide a
framework for developing new strategies for the treatment
of the deadliest metastases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell viability assay, dose-response relationship
and synergism

Materials

143B-GFP-Luc cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were
seeded in 96-well plate overnight and then treated with
different concentrations of doxorubicin (0, 5, 10, 20,
50, 100, 200, 500 nM), sorafenib (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50
µM), miR-34a prodrug (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 nM) or
the combination in fixed ratio (doxorubicin: sorafenib:
miR-34a, 10:1000:1). After 72 hours, cell viability was
determined by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability
Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The degrees of
inhibition were calculated by adjusting the vehicle control
group to 0% and dose-response curves were established by
plotting inhibition versus drug concentration. Cells were
treated in quadruplicate and assayed separately. Data were
fit to a normalized inhibitory dose-response model with
variable slope (Y = 100/(1+10^((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope);
GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA) for the estimation of
EC50, Hill slope, and Bottom values.
The Chou-Talalay approach [44] was employed to
further analyze interactions of these three drugs in the
inhibition of human OS 143B-GFP-Luc cell growth. For
triple therapy, doxorubicin and sorafenib were used as an
entirety to combine with miR-34a. The combination index
(CI) values at each fraction affected (Fa) were calculated
with CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Inc., USA) to
define the combinational effects, i.e., CI < 1 indicates
synergism, CI = 1 indicates additivity, and CI > 1 indicates
antagonism. In addition, the dose reduction index (DRI)
values were calculated for the evaluation of dose reduction
levels in combination therapy [44].

Doxorubicin (hydrochloride salt, > 99%) and
sorafenib (p-toluenesulfonate salt, > 99%) were purchased
from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA). RPMI 1640
medium, trypsin and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
fetal bovine serum, opti-MEM, BCA Protein Assay Kit,
and Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Kit were bought
from Thermo-Fisher Scientific Inc (Waltham, MA,
USA). RIPA buffer was bought from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA) and protease inhibitor cocktail was
from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Bovine
Serum Albumin and in vivo-jetPEI were purchased from
VWR (Visalia, CA, USA). ECL substrate and PVDF
membrane were supplied by Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA,
USA). Crystal violet was bought from MP Biomedicals,
LLC (Solon, OH, USA). Manufacturers of antibodies used
for western blot and immunofluorescence were shown in
Supplementary Table S1. All other chemicals and organic
solvents of analytical grade were purchased from SigmaAldrich or Thermo-Fisher Scientific Inc.

Biologic miR-34a prodrug
Bioengineered miR-34a prodrug (tRNA/pre-miR34a) was expressed in E. coli (strain HST08) and purified
by an anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatograph
(FPLC) method, as described [13, 14, 43]. The purity
of miR-34a prodrug was assessed by denaturing
urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and
determined quantitatively by high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) analysis [14]. Endotoxin
activities were determined using the Pyrogent-5000 kinetic
LAL assay (Lonza) by following the instructions. The
miR-34a prodrugs over 98% pure and less than 10 EU/
µg RNA were used in the following study. Lipofectamine
3000 and in vivo-jetPEI were used for the delivery of miR34a to cells and animals, respectively.

Invasion assay
Invasive potential of 143B-GFP-Luc cells, treated
with vehicle, or 12 nM miR-34a, or 40 nM doxorubicin
plus 4 µM sorafenib, or the combination for 72 h, was
assessed as described previously [16, 17, 45] by using
Corning BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber with 8.0
mm PET membrane coated with matrigel (Corning, NY,
USA). Briefly, 5 × 104 cells in 500 µl serum-free RPMI
1640 media were placed into the upper insert, and 750
µl medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added into
the well as a chemo-attractant. 30 h later, cells in the
upper inserts were removed and the lower were fixed with
10% formalin, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and then
photographed with five fields per insert under an Olympus
IX2-UCB microscope (40 × magnifications). Each
treatment group was conducted in triplicate and assessed
independently. The quantification of invaded cells was
calculated using Image J software and invasion capacity
was determined by adjusting the vehicle control group to
100%.

Human cell lines
The human OS cell lines 143B (CRL-8303)
was bought from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
containing 10% FBS. The luciferase and GFP-expressing
143B-GFP-Luc cells were generated after transduction
with pCCLc-Luc-EGFP lentiviral constructs (Vector Core,
UC Davis Medical center, Sacramento CA).

Immunofluorescence study on γH2A.X foci

experiments. Animals were randomly assigned to
treatment groups and closely monitored. Mice were
euthanized if tumor size reached 2,000 mm3 (roughly 10%
baseline body weight) or exceeded 2 cm in any direction,
or body weight decreased 20%, otherwise, they were
euthanized at the end of the study.
To establish orthotopic osteosarcoma xenograft/
spontaneous metastasis mouse models, 143B-GFPLuc cells (7.2 × 105 cells suspended in 40 µl PBS) were
injected into the right tibia of anesthetized 7-week-old
female mice [36, 46]. Tumor growth was monitored by
bioluminescence imaging and measured with a caliper. In
particular, tumor volume was calculated using the formula,
tumor volume (mm3) = (length + width) × length × width ×
0.2618 [16, 36]. For bioluminescent imaging, D-luciferin
(150 mg/kg) (BioVision, Inc. Milpitas, CA, USA) was
injected into the abdominal cavity of anesthetized mice
immediately before imaging. Images were acquired by
KODAK Image Station 4000 Digital Imaging Systems and
analyzed by Carestream Molecular Imaging Software 5.4.2
(Carestream Health, Inc.). On day 11 after inoculation, 56
mice were divided into 8 groups (7 mice in each group)
according to the tumor volume and bioluminescent
intensity to receive two cycles of treatments. The 1st cycle
consisted of doxorubicin (12 µg/mouse, intravenously
(IV), every other day (QOD) for 4 times), sorafenib (200
µg/mouse, intragastrically (IG), every day (QD) for 7
times), or/and miR-34a (12 µg/mouse, IV, QOD for 4
times). The 2nd cycle consisted of doxorubicin (10 µg/
mouse, IV, QOD for 4 times), sorafenib (200 µg/mouse,
IG, QOD for 4 times) or/and miR-34a (10 µg/mouse, IV,
QOD for 4 times). At the end of the study, all mice were
sacrificed and tumors were dissected and weighed. The
lung tissues were dissected for ex vivo GFP imaging and
fixed in 10% formalin, and then subjected to hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining for histological evaluation in
the Clinical Immunohistochemistry Laboratory at Roswell
Park Cancer Institute (Buffalo, NY, USA). Additionally,
serum was isolated using a serum separator (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and then subjected to
blood chemistry profiling in the Comparative Pathology
Laboratory at UC Davis. Serum cardiac troponin-I (cTnI)
was analyzed with a Mouse Cardiac Troponin-I ELISA Kit
(Life diagnostics, Inc. West Chester, PA, USA).
To establish artificial metastasis mouse models for
survival study, 9-week-old female mice were inoculated
with 5 × 106 143B-GFP-Luc cells in 250 µl PBS per
mouse via the tail vein injection. 12 days later, the mice
were randomized to 4 groups to receive two cycles of miR34a, doxorubicin/sorafenib, doxorubicin/sorafenib+miR34a or control vehicle treatment. The 1st cycle consisted
of doxorubicin (12 µg/mouse, IV, QOD for 6 times),
sorafenib (200 µg/mouse, IG, QD for 10 times), or/and
miR-34a (12 µg/mouse, IV, QOD for 6 times). The 2nd
cycle consisted of doxorubicin (10 µg/mouse, IV, QOD for
8 times), sorafenib (200 µg/mouse, IG, QOD for 8 times)

143B-GFP-Luc Cells (1 × 105 per well) were plated
into 6-well plates with coverslips on the bottom and then
treated with vehicle, doxorubicin (40 nM), sorafenib (4
µM) and miR-34a (12 nM) alone or in combination on
the next day. 24 hours later, cells were fixed with 10%
formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed
three times in PBS, and blocked for 1 h in PBS consisting
of 2% bovine serum albumin/0.3% Triton X-100 (Fisher
Scientific) at room temperature. After rinsed three times
in PBS, cells were incubated with anti-γH2A.X (Ser139)
antibody (1:800, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA) overnight at 4 °C. After washed with PBS for 3 times,
cells were incubated in Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (1:800, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h
at room temperature in dark. Nucleus was counterstained
with DAPI using Prolong® Gold Antifade Reagent (Cell
Signaling Technology). Images were taken with a Zeiss
Axio Observer.z1 Microscope coupled to a Zeiss LSM 710
Scanning Device (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

Protein isolation and immunoblot analysis
Human OS 143B-GFP-Luc cells were treated with
doxorubicin (40 nM), sorafenib (4 µM) and miR-34a (12
nM) alone or in combination. Cells were collected at 72
h post-treatment and lysed in RIPA buffer containing
protease inhibitor cocktail. Following determination of
protein concentrations with a BCA Protein Assay Kit,
protein samples (30 µg/lane) were loaded and separated
on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto PVDF
membranes. Membranes were incubated with anti-c-MET
(1:200; C-28; Santa Cruz, Dallas, Texas), anti-p-Erk1/2
(1:1000; Thr202/Tyr204; Cell Signaling Technology),
or anti-GAPDH (1:2,000; FL-335; Santa Cruz) rabbit
antibody, and then with a peroxidase goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA, USA).
After incubation with Clarity Western ECL substrates
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), the proteins were
visualized with the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (BioRad) and quantified by Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).
GAPDH was used as a loading control.

Animal models and therapy studies
All animal procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
University of California, Davis, and all animal studies
were conducted in accordance with the relevant national
and international guidelines. Non-obese diabetic/ severe
combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice (NOD.
CB17-Prkdcscid/J) were purchased from Jackson
Laboratory and adaptively fed at least one week before
