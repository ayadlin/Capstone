Abstract
One key to malignant progression is the acquired ability of tumor cells to escape immune-mediated lysis.
Whereas tumor hypoxia is known to play a causal role in cancer metastasis and resistance to therapy, the link
between hypoxia and immune escape in cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we show that hypoxia induces
tumor cell resistance to lysis mediated by immune effectors and that this resistance to lysis occurs via a hypoxiainducible factor-1 (HIF-1)–dependent pathway linked to increased expression of the metalloproteinase ADAM10.
This enzyme is required for the hypoxia-induced shedding of MHC class I chain–related molecule A (MICA), a
ligand that triggers the cytolytic action of immune effectors, from the surface of tumor cells. Indeed, our ﬁndings
show a mechanistic link between hypoxia-induced accumulation of the a-subunit of HIF-1 (HIF-1a), increased
expression of ADAM10, and decreased surface MICA levels leading to tumor cell resistance to lysis mediated by
innate immune effectors. Nitric oxide mimetic agents interfered with the hypoxia-induced accumulation of HIF1a and with the hypoxia-induced upregulation of ADAM10 expression required for decreased surface MICA
expression and resistance to lysis. Furthermore, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with nitroglycerin, a nitric
oxide mimetic, attenuated tumor growth by a mechanism that relied upon innate immune effector cells. Together,
these ﬁndings reveal a novel mechanism by which the hypoxic tumor microenvironment contributes to immune
escape in cancer, lending support to potential immunotherapeutic strategies involving the use of nitric oxide
mimetics. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7433–41. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Studies conducted in the last 15 years have provided convincing evidence that the immune system plays a critical role in
the prevention and control of cancer (1). However, an important aspect of malignant progression is the acquired ability of
tumor cells to escape detection and destruction by the innate
and adaptive arms of the immune system (1).
While many studies have shown the important contribution
of tumor hypoxia to the acquisition of malignant properties
in cancer cells, such as resistance to chemotherapeutic agents
(2–4) and increased metastatic potential (5–7), the effect of
hypoxia on tumor immune escape remains poorly understood.

It has been reported that hypoxia stimulates in tumor cells the
release of immunosuppressive molecules (8–10), and more
recently, that it increases lung cancer cell resistance to cytotoxic T-cell–mediated lysis (11). Other studies have focused on
assessing the direct effect of hypoxia on the activity of innate
immune effectors rather than on hypoxia-induced adaptations
of tumor cells that might endow them with resistance to
immunosurveillance (12, 13). We previously showed that in
vitro exposure of tumor cells to hypoxia increases their resistance to lysis mediated by interleukin (IL)-2–activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (IL-2/PBL) via a mechanism secondary
to deﬁcient endogenous nitric oxide signaling (14). This effect
of hypoxia was due to the shedding of MHC class I chain–
related molecule A (MICA) from the tumor cell surface.
Both MICA and its closely related MICB molecule play
important roles in tumor surveillance by natural killer (NK)
cells, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, and cytotoxic T
cells (15). While MIC molecules are absent from most normal
tissues, they are induced by cellular stresses, such as exposure
to carcinogens and infection, and are expressed in various
types of carcinomas and some hematopoietic malignancies
(16). In humans, the interaction of cell surface MIC with the
dominant activating natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) receptor
complexes on NK, LAK, and effector T cells leads to the
activation of innate and adaptive immune responses and the
subsequent lysis of the tumor cells (17). Thus, MIC–NKG2D

interactions are critical to the surveillance function of immune
effectors; consequently, decreased expression of MIC molecules on the surface of malignant cells represents an important
aspect of immune escape.
Given that NKG2D ligands play such a critical role in immunosurveillance of cancer, it is important to elucidate mechanisms responsible for decreasing the levels of these molecules on
the cell membrane and to determine the potential contribution
of the tumor microenvironment to the regulation of these
mechanisms. One important mechanism involves the proteolytic cleavage and release of the ectodomains of NKG2D ligands.
Studies have revealed that transmembrane metalloproteinases
including members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) enzymes, that is, ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17,
as well as matrix metalloproteinase 14 are responsible for the
shedding of MICA and MICB from the surface of various cell
types (18–20). Interestingly, these metalloproteinases have also
been implicated in other aspects of malignant progression such
as tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis.
Here, we provide evidence that hypoxia contributes to tumor
cell resistance to lysis mediated by IL-2/PBLs through stimulation of ADAM10 expression and, consequently, decreased
levels of MICA on the tumor cell membrane. We also show that
this mechanism of immune escape is blocked by nitric oxide via
inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) accumulation. The latter is the oxygen-regulated subunit of HIF-1, a
transcription factor responsible for cellular adaptations to
hypoxia (21).

Materials and Methods
Cells and culture conditions
Human DU145 prostate cancer and MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. These cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination, but their identity had not been conﬁrmed within
the last 6 months prior to initiation of this study. Cells were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS (Invitrogen Canada Inc.). For incubations in standard
conditions (20% O2), cells were placed in a Thermo CO2
incubator. For incubations in hypoxia (0.5% O2), cells were
placed in a chamber that was ﬂushed with a gas mixture of 5%
CO2/95% N2. Oxygen concentrations within the chamber were
maintained at 0.5% by means of a ProOx 110 oxygen regulator
(Biospherix). Additional culture conditions included incubation of tumor cells with or without nitroglycerin (glyceryl
trinitrate; GTN), diethylenetriamine-nitric oxide (DETA-NO),
or 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP).
siRNA transfection
A transfection reagent, siPORT NeoFX (Ambion Inc.) was
used according to the manufacturer's instructions to introduce
siRNA into cells. Both HIF-1a and ADAM10 siRNAs were
validated and were obtained from Applied Biosystems.
Western blotting
Following incubation under various conditions, cells were
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then lysed and sonicated.

Samples were resolved on 6% to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corporation).
Membranes were blocked for 1 hour and then incubated with
primary antibody in TBS/1% milk (reconstituted powder)
overnight at 4o C. Membranes were then washed and incubated
for 1 hour at room temperature with secondary antibody in
TBS/1% milk. Secondary antibodies were detected with
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and
exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue ﬁlm.
Assessment of surface MICA
Surface expression of MICA was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
Brieﬂy, cells were collected and incubated with monoclonal
mouse anti-human MICA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour on ice. After washing, cells were incubated with a
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated goat antimouse antibody for 1 hour and analyzed with a Beckman
Coulter EPICS Altra HSS ﬂow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter
Canada).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated by a High Pure RNA Isolation Kit
(Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One
microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche) using a random hexamer (Cortec). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was
done with a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche
Diagnostics Corp.). Primers for ADAM10 cDNA ampliﬁcation
were: forward 50 CTTCACAGACCGAGATTTTGATG30 and
reverse 50 CACATATTCCTCCAGAGCTTCC30 . b-Actin mRNA
served as internal control.
Isolation and puriﬁcation of murine NK cells
Two female and one male Balb/c mice (4–6 weeks in age)
were euthanized, and their spleens were excised and placed
in separate Petri dishes containing ice-cold PBS. To extract
splenocytes, spleens were placed on a ﬁne wire mesh, rinsed
with PBS, and crushed with the plunger of a 10-mL syringe.
Cells were resuspended in 15 mL of PBS and centrifuged for
10 minutes at 400  g. Cell pellets were resuspended in NK
cell isolation buffer [2 mmol/L ETDA, 0.5% bovine serum
albumin in PBS]. NK cell isolation was done by magnetic cell
sorting with an autoMACS separator and a murine NK cell
Isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cytotoxicity assay
The sensitivity of DU145 prostate tumor cells to cytolysis
mediated by IL-2–activated human PBLs isolated from 2
healthy donors and isolated murine splenic NK cells was
determined by a LIVE/DEAD cell viability/cytotoxicity assay
(Invitrogen). Prior to the assay, tumor cells were transfected
with either HIF-1a siRNA or ADAM10 siRNA or scrambled
siRNA (Ambion) and allowed to recover for 24 hours. After
further incubation in 20% O2 or 0.5% O2 for 24 hours, DU145
prostate tumor cells were incubated with IL-2–activated PBLs
or murine NK cells in 96-well culture plates at different
lymphocyte:tumor cell ratios (100:1, 50:1, 25:1, and 12.5:1) for

Hypoxia Induces Immune Escape in Cancer

4 hours at 37 C, in the absence or presence of blocking
polyclonal goat anti-MICA antibody (0.5 mg/mL; R&D Systems). Cocultures were then incubated with red ﬂuorescent
ethidium homodimer-1 for 30 minutes at 37 C. Fluorescence in
plates was analyzed using a ﬂuorescence multiwell plate reader
(Varioskan 3001; ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc). Cell lysis was evaluated by calculating the percentage of dead cells in each
sample at the completion of the assay. This was determined
according to the manufacturer's instructions using the
following formula: ([F(645)sample  F(645)min]/[F(645)max 
F(645)min])  100 ¼ % dead cells.
Confocal immunoﬂuorescence
Expression of ADAM10 in human DU145 cells cultured
under standard (20% O2) or hypoxic (0.5% O2) conditions was
assessed by confocal immunoﬂuorescence using a monoclonal
anti-ADAM10 antibody (R&D Systems). Controls consisted of
cells incubated with mouse IgG.
Tumor growth study
Six- to 8-week-old male athymic NIH Swiss nude (nu/nu)
mice (Taconic) were inoculated subcutaneously in the left hind
ﬂank with 2  106 DU145 cells in 0.2 mL of growth factor–
reduced Matrigel. When the tumors reached a volume of 100
mm3, mice were randomly divided in 4 groups of 10 to 20 mice
each as follows: (i) NK/LAK cell–deﬁcient mice treated with
square 0.25 cm2 Minitran transdermal patches (3M Pharmaceuticals) delivering 1.8 mg of GTN per hour and placed on the
back of the neck; (ii) NK/LAK cell–deﬁcient mice treated with
transdermal placebo patches (see later for details on NK/LAK
cell depletion); (iii) NK/LAK cell–competent mice treated with
GTN patches; and (iv) NK/LAK cell–competent mice treated
with placebo patches. Transdermal patches were changed
daily and were covered with a thin layer of New Skin Liquid
Bandage (Medtech) to prevent mice from removing them
during treatment. Tumor growth was measured every 2 days
with digital calipers, and tumor volumes were determined
according to the formula (length  width)2  0.5. Mice were
sacriﬁced after approximately 62 days of treatment. Studies
were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
Canadian Council on Animal Care.
NK/LAK cell depletion
To deplete mouse NK/LAK cell populations, anti-asialo GM1
antibody (Wako Chemicals) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.;
100 mL) every 5 days for the duration of the tumor growth
experiment (approximately 62 days). Antibody injections were
initiated concurrently with application of the transdermal
patches. Before initiating the tumor growth study, the efﬁcacy
of the anti-asialo GM1 antibody at depleting NK cells was
conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometric determination of CD3/
CD122þ/DX5þ splenocytes (representing activated NK cells)
in a separate group of 3 mice that received 3 injections of antiasialo GM1 antibody 5 days apart. Results of that experiment
revealed an 80% reduction in the numbers of activated NK cells
in mice injected with rabbit polyclonal anti-asialo GM1 antibody versus mice injected with normal rabbit serum (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Furthermore, the presence of NK/LAK cells

www.aacrjournals.org

in excised tumors at the end of the experiment was determined
by immunohistochemistry for perforin (NK/LAK/CD8þ T-cell
marker) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Torrey Pines
Biolabs). Results of that study revealed the presence of perforin-positive cells only in tumors from mice injected with
normal rabbit serum and not in mice injected with anti-asialo
GM1 antibody (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Statistical analysis
Values are expressed as means  SEM. For statistical
comparisons, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test was used. For the cytotoxicity
assays, differences in killing were determined by ANOVA of the
y-intercepts of the linear regressions of data from individual
treatment groups. For the in vivo experiments, statistically
signiﬁcant differences in tumor growth were determined by
comparing the slopes of the log10-transformed volumes of
individual tumors using the exact Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney
test. Tumor growth curves were found to ﬁt an exponential
model. All statistical tests were 2-tailed. Sample sizes and
number of times experiments were repeated are indicated in
the ﬁgure legends. Number of asterisks in the ﬁgures indicates
the level of statistical signiﬁcance as follows:  , P < 0.05;  , P <
0.01;  , P < 0.001.

Results
Hypoxia-mediated inhibition of surface MICA expression
and increased tumor cell resistance to innate immune
cytotoxicity requires HIF-1a expression
To determine whether the hypoxia-mediated inhibition of
surface MICA expression is dependent on HIF-1 transcriptional activity, we knocked down HIF-1a using validated siRNA.
Western blot analysis revealed that transient transfection of
HIF-1a siRNA in DU145 prostate cancer cells effectively inhibited the hypoxic accumulation of HIF-1a protein (Supplementary Fig. S2). While transfection of DU145 prostate cancer cells
and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with control siRNA did
not affect the expression of surface MICA as determined by
ﬂow cytometry, HIF-1a knockdown signiﬁcantly attenuated
the hypoxia-mediated decrease in surface MICA expression in
these cells (Fig. 1A and B). Representative ﬂow cytometric
histograms are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.
Results of cytotoxicity assays using cells transfected with
control siRNA revealed that, compared with preincubation in
20% O2, preincubation of DU145 prostate cancer cells in 0.5%
O2 resulted in increased resistance to IL-2/PBL–mediated
cytolysis (Fig. 1C). In contrast, transfection with HIF-1a siRNA
abrogated the hypoxia-induced resistance to IL-2/PBL–mediated cytolysis (Fig. 1D), indicating that HIF-1 is required for the
hypoxia-induced resistance to innate immune cytotoxicity. To
determine whether the decreased expression of surface MICA
is causally linked to the hypoxia- and HIF-1–mediated resistance to cytolysis, we treated cells in the cytotoxicity assays
with an anti-MICA antibody that blocks interactions of MICA
with NKG2D. Results showed that anti-MICA antibody
increased the resistance to cytolysis in control siRNA-transfected DU145 cells preincubated in 20% O2 (Fig. 1C). However,

analysis of surface MICA expression in DU145 (A) and MDA-MB-231 (B) cells either untransfected or transfected with control siRNA or HIF-1a siRNA.
Asterisk in A and B indicates signiﬁcant differences ( , P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test) versus the 2 other
treatment groups. Data in A and B represent combined results of 6 to 9 independent ﬂow cytometry experiments. C and D, cytolytic activity of human PBLs
against DU145 cells preincubated in 20% O2 or 0.5% O2 following transient transfection with control siRNA (C) or HIF-1a siRNA (D). Percentage of killing was
measured by a 2-color ﬂuorescence cell viability assay. Data are presented as mean percentage of killing SEM and are representative of 2 to 4 independent
experiments done in triplicate (i.e., experiments involving HIF-1a knockdown alone were done 4 times, whereas experiments involving HIF-1a knockdown 
MICA blocking antibody were done twice). Asterisks in C and D indicate signiﬁcant differences (   , P < 0.001; ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple

the anti-MICA antibody was unable to further increase the
resistance to cytolysis in control siRNA-transfected DU145
cells preincubated in 0.5% O2 (Fig. 1C), which already exhibited
resistance even in the absence of anti-MICA antibody. Furthermore, anti-MICA antibody blocked the increased sensitivity to cytolysis in hypoxic DU145 cells transfected with HIF-1a
siRNA (Fig. 1D). In fact, inclusion of anti-MICA antibody
increased the resistance of DU145 cells to IL-2/PBL–mediated
cytolysis to the same extent under all experimental conditions
(Fig. 1C and D).
Hypoxia-mediated downregulation of surface MICA
levels and resistance to cytolysis require ADAM10
expression
To determine whether ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 mediate
the hypoxia-induced resistance to IL-2/PBL–mediated lysis of
tumor cells, we ﬁrst assessed whether hypoxia increases the
expression of these enzymes. Results of Western blot analysis
revealed that whereas hypoxia did not increase the levels of

7436

Cancer Res; 71(24) December 15, 2011

ADAM17 in DU145 or MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown), the
levels of ADAM10 in tumor cells increased following a 24-hour
incubation in hypoxia (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4).
Confocal immunoﬂuorescence provided further support for
this observation (Fig. 2B), and results of qRT-PCR indicated
that hypoxia increased the levels of ADAM10 transcript in
DU145 and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2C and D) cells. While hypoxia
increased the level of ADAM10 mRNA by approximately 8-fold,
Western blot analysis revealed only a 2-fold increase in protein
levels. This may be due to posttranscriptional regulatory
mechanisms.
We also knocked down HIF-1a expression to assess whether
HIF-1 is required for the hypoxia-induced upregulation of
ADAM10 expression. Results of qRT-PCR showed that HIF1a knockdown prevented the hypoxia-induced increase in
ADAM10 transcript levels in DU145 and MDA-MB-231 cells
(Fig. 2C and D), indicating that the hypoxia-induced expression
of ADAM10 is HIF-1-dependent. In support of this conclusion,

known stabilizer of HIF-1a (22), resulted in increased ADAM10
mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To determine whether the hypoxia-mediated decrease in
surface MICA levels and resistance of tumor cells to IL-2/PBL–
mediated lysis is dependent on ADAM10, we knocked down
ADAM10 expression using the siRNA approach. Western blot
analysis and qRT-PCR revealed that introduction of ADAM10
siRNA in DU145 prostate cancer cells effectively inhibited the
hypoxic accumulation of ADAM10 protein and mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S4). Knockdown of ADAM10 expression in
DU145 cells abrogated the hypoxia-mediated decrease in surface MICA levels (Fig. 3A) as well as the hypoxia-induced
resistance to IL-2/PBL–mediated cytolysis (Fig. 3B). Together,
these ﬁndings indicate that hypoxia induces escape from
immune effector–mediated cytolysis through an HIF-1–dependent mechanism requiring the upregulation of ADAM10. To
further elucidate the link between increased expression of
ADAM10, decreased surface MICA levels, and resistance to
IL-2/PBL–mediated lysis, we conducted cytotoxicity assays in
which MICA–NKG2D interactions were blocked with antiMICA antibody. While ADAM10 knockdown restored the
sensitivity of hypoxic DU145 cells up to levels similar to those
observed in DU145 cells incubated in 20% O2, anti-MICA

hypoxia increased the levels of
ADAM10 protein in DU145 cells,
incubation with 8-Br-cGMP (10

antibody abrogated this effect (Fig. 3B). In fact, inclusion of
anti-MICA antibody resulted in levels of resistance to cytolysis
similar to those observed in hypoxia-exposed DU145 cells
transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 3B). Together, these
results are consistent with the concept that hypoxia acts in
concert with ADAM10 to reduce the levels of surface MICA and
to increase resistance to IL-2/PBL–mediated cytolysis.
Nitric oxide inhibits the hypoxia-induced expression
of ADAM10 and the hypoxia-induced accumulation of
HIF-1a
Nitric oxide in hypoxic tumor cells inhibits adaptations
leading to malignant phenotypes such as increased metastatic
ability and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (6, 23, 24).
Therefore, we examined whether nitric oxide signaling also
regulates the hypoxia-induced upregulation of ADAM10
expression. Our results revealed that, indeed, activation of
nitric oxide signaling with nitroglycerin (1 mmol/L) or
DETA-NO (1 mmol/L) effectively attenuated the hypoxiainduced increases in ADAM10 transcript levels in DU145
prostate cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
(Fig. 4A–C). Consistent with these results, 8-Br-cGMP (a

The nitric oxide mimetic nitroglycerin attenuates the
growth of human prostate tumors in nude mice via a
mechanism dependent on innate immune effector cells
On the basis of our present in vitro ﬁndings, we hypothesized
that innate immune effector cells, such as NK cells and LAK
cells, are responsible for the attenuation of tumor growth in
nitroglycerin-treated mice. To test this hypothesis, we adopted
a model in which human DU145 cells were injected subcutaneously into male NIH Swiss nude mice (T- and B-cell–deﬁcient, NK/LAK cell–competent). While mouse tissues do not
express MICA, these molecules, present on transplanted
human tumor cells, can bind murine NKG2D and act as potent
activating ligands (27). Indeed, results of cytotoxicity assays
revealed that IL-2–activated mouse NK cells are capable of
killing DU145 cells in a MICA-dependent manner, as inclusion
of anti-MICA antibody decreased the sensitivity of tumor cells
preincubated in 20% O2 down to levels similar to those
observed in DU145 cells preincubated in hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S7). These results are in agreement with our results
shown in Figs. 1 and 2 using IL-2–activated human PBLs.
DU145 prostatic tumors became palpable approximately 2
weeks following subcutaneous transplantation into nude mice
and were allowed to grow for approximately 60 days. At the end
of the study, tumors were excised, and HIF-1a and ADAM10
were localized in sections using immunoﬂuorescence (Supplementary Fig. S8; method included in the legend). Results

revealed that regions labeled with HIF-1a always overlapped
with ADAM10 labeling. However, regions showing labeling for
ADAM10 did not always exhibit HIF-1a immunoreactivity.
We observed that the subcutaneous growth of human
DU145 prostate tumors in NIH Swiss nude mice was signiﬁcantly attenuated after continuous administration of nitroglycerin (1.8 mg/h) via a transdermal patch (Fig. 6). However,
this inhibition of tumor growth mediated by nitroglycerin was
lost in mice depleted of their NK/LAK cells (see the Material
and Methods section for details on immune effector cell
depletion). These ﬁndings provide evidence in support of the
concept that nitroglycerin attenuates in vivo tumor growth by
sensitizing tumor cells to recognition and elimination by the
innate immune system.

Previous studies showed that nitric oxide can interfere with
the accumulation of HIF-1a under hypoxia (25, 26). On the
basis of the observation that the hypoxia-induced increase of
ADAM10 expression in tumor cells is HIF-1–dependent, we
determined the effect of nitric oxide mimetic agents on HIF-1a
accumulation. Western blot analysis revealed that nitroglycerin (1 mmol/L) and 8-Br-cGMP (10 nmol/L) were able to block
the accumulation of HIF-1a in DU145 cells incubated in
hypoxia (Fig. 5A and B). These results indicate that a mechanism by which nitric oxide mimetics interfere with the
hypoxia-induced upregulation of ADAM10 expression is via
inhibition of HIF-1a accumulation. They also provide evidence
in support for a mechanism of inhibition of HIF-1a via the
classical cGMP-dependent signaling pathway.

Discussion
For malignant progression to occur in immunocompetent
individuals, tumors must develop strategies to evade immunosurveillance. Some of these strategies include, among many,
the release of immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., TGF-b, IL10, and prostaglandins), escape from immune-mediated apoptosis, and the release of tumor cell surface antigens. Wu and
colleagues reported the shedding of MIC molecules in
advanced prostate cancers and that this shedding may be part
of a mechanism of escape from immune cytotoxicity (28).
Furthermore, a signiﬁcant correlation between circulating
soluble MICA levels and tumor stage and metastasis in patients
with various malignancies has been reported (29).
In the present study, we showed that hypoxia, a well-recognized driver of malignant progression, contributes to
immune escape in prostate and breast tumor cells by increasing the expression of ADAM10 in an HIF-1–dependent manner.
We provide evidence that decreased MICA levels on the surface
of tumor cells underlies the mechanism of immune escape
induced by HIF-1 and ADAM10. Our results also reveal that
activation of nitric oxide signaling interferes with this mechanism of immune escape.
Our study focused on the effect of hypoxia on tumor cell
escape from innate immunity. To determine the effect of
nitroglycerin on in vivo tumor cell susceptibility to lysis by
innate immune effectors, we adopted an immunocompromised mouse tumor xenotransplantation model. NIH Swiss
nude mice are deﬁcient in B and T lymphocytes but have a
full complement of NK cells and LAK cells. Our results
showed that nonprimed IL-2–activated murine NK cells are
capable of killing human DU145 cells via a MICA-dependent mechanism. Thus, nude mice are suitable for studies
on tumor cell escape from innate immunity. Also, because
antibody-mediated depletion of NK and LAK cells can be
easily achieved in these mice, the effect of nitroglycerin on
tumor growth can be assessed in the absence of cells from
the adaptive arm of the immune system, such as T and B
lymphocytes. Interestingly, in our study, nitroglycerin therapy failed to attenuate tumor growth in nude mice treated
with anti-asialo GM1 antibody, indicating that innate
immune effector cells, in this model, mediate the tumor
growth-inhibitory effects of nitroglycerin.
Our previous studies revealed that activation of nitric oxide
signaling inhibits the hypoxia-mediated acquisition of tumor
cell invasiveness, metastatic potential, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (6, 23, 24). The results of the present
study indicate that another important aspect of malignant
progression, that is, escape from immunosurveillance is regulated in a similar manner. On the basis of our in vitro ﬁndings,
it is likely that nitric oxide mimetics attenuate in vivo tumor
growth by inhibiting HIF-1a accumulation in the tumor cells,

thereby preventing ADAM10 expression and the subsequent
shedding of MICA.
Interestingly, 2 different classes of nitric oxide mimetics,
nitroglycerin and DETA-NO, were able to block the effect of
hypoxia at the level of HIF-1a accumulation or ADAM10
expression. It was previously shown that certain nitric oxide
mimetics that inhibit mitochondrial respiration under mildly
hypoxic conditions, including DETA-NO, block HIF-1a accumulation as a result of a redistribution of intracellular oxygen
leading to degradation of HIF-1a (25). However, in our study 8Br-cGMP, an analogue of the nitric oxide signaling second
messenger cGMP that does not inhibit mitochondrial function,
also prevented HIF-1a accumulation. These results support
the concept that NO-mediated inhibition of HIF-1a can occur
via the classical cGMP-dependent signaling pathway.
In summary, our results show a novel mechanism by which
hypoxia contributes to immune escape in tumor cells and
provide evidence that activation of nitric oxide signaling
interferes with this mechanism. The ﬁndings described here
are important because they indicate that nitric oxide mimetics
could potentially be used as immunosensitisers in the treatment and/or prevention of cancer.
