Abstract
Taxane antineoplastic agents are extensively taken up into hepatocytes by OATP1B-type transporters before
metabolism and excretion. Because the biodistributional properties imposed upon these agents by different
solubilizers drive clinically important pharmacodynamic endpoints, we tested the hypothesis that the in vitro and
in vivo interaction of taxanes with OATP1B transporters is affected by the choice of drug delivery system.
Transport of paclitaxel, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel was studied in vitro using various cell lines transfected with
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or the rodent equivalent OATP1B2. Pharmacokinetic studies were done in wild-type and
OATP1B2-knockout mice in the presence or absence of polysorbate 80 (PS80) or Kolliphor EL (formerly
Cremophor EL; CrEL). Paclitaxel and docetaxel, but not cabazitaxel, were transported substrates of OATP1B1,
OATP1B3, and OATP1B2, and these in vitro transport processes were strongly reduced in the presence of clinically
relevant concentrations of PS80 and CrEL. When paclitaxel was administered without any solubilizers, deﬁciency
of OATP1B2 in mice was associated with a signiﬁcantly decreased systemic clearance because of a liver
distribution defect (P ¼ 0.000484). However, this genotype dependence of paclitaxel clearance was masked in
the presence of PS80 or CrEL because of signiﬁcant inhibition of OATP1B2-mediated hepatocellular uptake
of the drug (P < 0.05). Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the importance of OATP1B-type transporters in the hepatic
elimination of taxanes and indicate that this process can be inhibited by PS80 and CrEL. These results suggest
that the likelihood of drug–drug interactions mediated by these transporters is strongly dependent on the
selected taxane solubilizer. Cancer Res; 74(11); 3137–45. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The nonionic surfactants Kolliphor EL (formerly Cremophor
EL; CrEL) and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80; PS80) are widely used
to solubilize drugs, including the taxane-based antineoplastic
agents paclitaxel (1), docetaxel (2), and cabazitaxel (3).
A wealth of experimental data has indicated that these solubilizers are biologically and pharmacologically active compounds, and their use as drug formulation vehicles has been
implicated in clinically important toxic side effects such as
acute hypersensitivity reactions (4). CrEL and PS80 have also
been found to inﬂuence the disposition of solubilized drugs
administered intravenously (5). This is particularly striking in
the case of paclitaxel formulated in CrEL, where the overall

resulting effect is a highly increased systemic exposure to
paclitaxel (6), which is dependent on the dose and time-varying
blood concentrations of the solubilizer (7). Kinetic experiments (8, 9) and model-based predictions (10, 11) have revealed
that paclitaxel undergoes reversible partitioning into a circulating surfactant microemulsion that acts as a nano-sink and
reduces the fraction of free drug available for extravascular
distribution.
In line with these predictions, it was demonstrated that CrEL
can inhibit the hepatic elimination of paclitaxel in the isolated
perfused rat liver, the main organ of elimination (12), by
preventing the drug from reaching sites of metabolism and
excretion (13). This process is believed to be primarily mediated by the organic anion-transporting polypeptides OATP1B3
(in humans; refs. 14 and 15) and OATP1B2 (in rodents; refs. 16
and 17), which are uptake transporters localized to the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes (18). To add further to the
complexity of the carrier-mediated disposition properties of
paclitaxel, CrEL was found to strongly inhibit the uptake of
OATP1B3 substrates in vitro into cells overexpressing the
transporter (19). However, the mechanistic basis underlying
this observation, as well as its in vivo relevance, remains
unclear.
Because the biodistributional properties imposed upon taxanes by different solubilizers drive clinically important pharmacodynamic endpoints that further depend, at least in part,
on whether or not the pharmacokinetics of carrier-released

(free) drug is formulation-dependent (10), we here tested the
hypothesis that the in vitro and in vivo interaction of paclitaxel
with OATP1B-type transporters is affected by the choice of a
particular drug delivery system.

Materials and Methods
In vitro transport studies
Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or
rat OATP1B2 cRNA along with water-injected controls were
obtained from BD Biosciences. The transporter nomenclature
used throughout is based on recent recommendations proposed by Hagenbuch and Stieger (20). The transporter-expressing oocytes were functionally characterized by assessing the
uptake of estrone-3-sulfate (2 mmol/L) by OATP1B1 and
OATP1B2, and of estradiol-17b-D-glucuronide (2 mmol/L) by
OATP1B3. Human embryonal kidney (HEK293) cells overexpressing OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OATP1B2 have been
described previously (21). The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cells expressing OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 were generated as
follows. The open reading frames of the two transporters
(22) were PCR ampliﬁed in order to introduce a 6-His tag at
the C-terminal end. The amplicons were ligated into pcDNA5/
FRT, and after verifying the sequences, Flp-In-CHO cells were
transfected with the plasmids in the presence of pOG44
following the manufacture's protocols (Life Technologies).
Cells were selected with hygromycin B (600 mg/mL) and single
clones were isolated by limited dilution. Overexpression of
transporters was conﬁrmed using TaqMan probes (Applied
Biosystems). The cell culture conditions and details of accumulation experiments for [3H]paclitaxel (speciﬁc activity,
25.6 Ci/mmol; Vitrax) and [3H]docetaxel (speciﬁc activity,
60.0 Ci/mmol; American RadioChemicals) were described
earlier (21). Radioactivity was quantiﬁed by liquid scintillation
counting using an LS 6500 Counter (Beckman).
Intracellular concentrations of cabazitaxel were measured
by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/
MS-MS), as described (23). Total protein was measured using a
Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and quantiﬁed using a Biotek mQuant microplate spectrophotometer.
Drug uptake results were normalized to total protein content
and then to data obtained in cells carrying an empty vector
plasmid, which was set to 100%.
Animal experiments
Wild-type and OATP1B2 knockout [OATP1B2(/)] mice,
both on a DBA/1lacJ background, between 8 and 12 weeks
of age, were housed in a temperature-controlled environment
with a 12-hour light cycle. Experiments were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. All mice received a
standard diet and water ad libitum and were fasted 3 hours
before drug administration. Paclitaxel was formulated in CrELethanol (1:1, v/v; Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb), PS80-ethanol
(1:1, v/v), or as an albumin-bound nanoparticle (nab-paclitaxel;
ABI-007; Abraxane; Celgene) without either CrEL or PS80.
These solutions were diluted in normal saline and administered by intravenous bolus in the tail vain at a dose of 10 mg/kg.
Docetaxel (Taxotere; Sanoﬁ-Aventis) and cabazitaxel (Jevtana;

3138

Cancer Res; 74(11) June 1, 2014

Sanoﬁ-Aventis) were formulated in PS80-ethanol (1:1, v/v),
diluted in normal saline (docetaxel) or 5% dextrose in water
(cabazitaxel), and then administered by tail vein injection at a
dose of 10 mg/kg.
In all experiments, at select time points after drug administration, blood samples (30 mL each) were taken from individual mice at 3.5, 7.5, and 15 minutes from the submandibular
vein using a lancet, and at 30 and 60 minutes from the retroorbital venous plexus using a capillary. A ﬁnal blood draw was
obtained at 120 minutes by a cardiac puncture using a syringe
and needle. Isoﬂurane was used as an anesthetic. The total
blood volume collected during the procedure from each mouse
was 150 mL. All blood samples were centrifuged at 1,500  g for
5 minutes, and plasma was separated and stored at 80 C until
analysis. Livers, kidneys, and small intestines were collected
from the same animals at 120 minutes. The lumen of small
intestines were purged using saline to remove remaining
content. A separate group of mice was euthanized by CO2
asphyxiation at 5 minutes and the same tissues were immediately collected and ﬂash-frozen on dry ice. To prevent
continuing metabolic activity, liver tissues were snap-frozen
using liquid nitrogen. All tissue specimens were stored at
80 C until further processing, as described (21). Samples
were analyzed by LC/MS-MS (see Supplementary Methods for
details; ref. 24), and noncompartmental parameters were calculated using WinNonlin 6.2 software (Pharsight). Concentrations in tissue were corrected for contaminating plasma (25).
Statistical considerations
All data are presented as mean  SD. Statistical analyses
were done using SPSS version 20 (SPSS), and P < 0.05 was
regarded as statistically signiﬁcant. Student t test (2 groups) or
one-way ANOVA (>2 groups) was used for statistical analysis
on in vitro uptake data, plasma pharmacokinetic parameters,
and tissue concentrations.

Results
Paclitaxel transport in vitro
Although previous in vitro studies have consistently identiﬁed paclitaxel as a potent inhibitor of OATP1B1- (22, 26)
and OATP1B3-mediated transport (22, 27, 28), the actual
transport of paclitaxel itself by these transporters remains
controversial (14, 28–30). The presented methodologic
details were selected on the basis of existing literature in
order to clarify the reported discrepancies in taxane transport by OATPs. In line with these conﬂicting data, we found
that the interaction of paclitaxel with human OATP1B1 and
OATP1B3 was dependent on cell context, with both proteins
being able to take up paclitaxel when expressed in HEK293
cells or CHO cells, but no noticeable transport occurring by
OATP1B1 expressed in X. laevis oocytes (Fig. 1A). Paclitaxel
was also found to be transported into cells expressing mouse
OATP1B2 or rat OATP1B2 (Fig. 1B), as predicted from
studies done in isolated rat hepatocytes (31).
In the absence of solubilizers, the transport of paclitaxel into
CHO cells transfected with OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 was found to
be time-dependent and saturable (Supplementary Fig. S1) with
a Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) of 0.408  0.190 mmol/L

OATP1B-Mediated Clearance of Paclitaxel

Figure 1. In vitro transport studies of paclitaxel. A, the uptake of paclitaxel by human OATP1B1 and human OATP1B3 was assessed in OATP1B1 and
OATP1B3-injected X. laevis oocytes (paclitaxel concentration, 2 mmol/L; 30 minute incubations), HEK293 cells (2 mmol/L; 30 minutes) and CHO cells (1 mmol/L;
2 minutes) and their respective vector controls (VC). B, the uptake of paclitaxel by mouse OATP1B2 transfected in HEK293 cells (0.1 mmol/L; 15 minute) or

cells (1 mmol/L; 2 minutes), or mouse OATP1B2 in HEK293 cells (0.1 mmol/L; 15 minute) was evaluated in the presence of different concentrations of PS80. D,

15 minutes) was evaluated in the presence of either CrEL (1%, w/v) or PS80 (1%, w/v), with results normalized to transporter-speciﬁc uptake. Data are

and 2.36  1.40 mmol/L, respectively, and a maximum velocity
(Vmax) of 22.1  3.20 pmol/mg/min and 14.2  5.26 pmol/mg/
min, respectively, values that are similar to those reported
previously for docetaxel (21).
Next, we evaluated the ability of CrEL and PS80 to inhibit
the intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel into CHO cells
overexpressing human OATP1B1, human OATP1B3, or
mouse OATP1B2. Recently, it was reported that the effect
of CrEL on the uptake of several substrates by OATP1B2,
OATP1B1, or OATP1B3 was dose dependent (19). Similar to
these ﬁndings, we found that PS80 also inhibited paclitaxel
uptake in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C),
which is in line with our observation that PS80 also affects
the transporter-mediated uptake of docetaxel (21). The
mechanism by which CrEL and PS80 inhibit OATP1B-type
transporters is unclear and requires additional investigation.
After correcting for nonspeciﬁc inhibition of paclitaxel
uptake occurring in cells transfected with an empty expression plasmid because of drug trapping in solubilizer micelles
(Supplementary Fig. S2), CrEL directly inhibited the trans-

porters in decreasing order of potency OATP1B3 > OATP1B2
> OATP1B1, whereas PS80 inhibited all transporters to a
similar extent (Fig. 1D).
Paclitaxel tissue distribution studies in vivo
We next evaluated the possible importance of these transporters for paclitaxel disposition in mice with a genetic deletion of OATP1B2 [OATP1B2(/) mice]. Early after administration (5 minutes) of paclitaxel as an albumin-bound nanoparticle (nab-paclitaxel) in the absence of a solubilizer, uptake
into the liver was dramatically decreased in OATP1B2(/)
mice (Fig. 2A). This ﬁnding suggests that immediately after
infusion paclitaxel uptake into the liver is mainly transportermediated, and is consistent with the notion that the amorphous nab-paclitaxel nanoparticles rapidly dissolve into soluble albumin-paclitaxel complexes with a size similar to that of
native albumin, with no nanoparticles detected at any time
point postinfusion (32). Therefore, phagocytosis-based uptake
mechanisms in the liver involving the reticulo-endothelial
system, which are relevant to the biodistribution of paclitaxel

nanoparticles that remain stable in the circulation (33), are not
contributing in the case of nab-paclitaxel.
As predicted based on the in vitro inhibition data, the differences in uptake of paclitaxel into the liver between wild-type
and OATP1B2(/) mice were much less pronounced in the
presence of PS80 or CrEL. In particular, the liver uptake in
wild-type mice receiving paclitaxel formulated in PS80 was
similar to that observed in OATP1B2(/) mice receiving
the drug without solubilizers, whereas uptake was further
reduced by about two-fold in the presence of CrEL (Fig. 2A).
Over time, the formulation-dependent differences in liver
uptake normalized to control levels for the PS80 group (Fig.
2B), but remained noticeably reduced in the presence of
CrEL. This is consistent with the fact that PS80 is very

rapidly cleared, with plasma levels becoming undetectable
within 15 minutes after intravenous administration (34),
whereas the half-life of CrEL amounts to >17 hours (6).
Interestingly, a similar solubilizer-, time-, and genotypedependent distribution of paclitaxel was observed for uptake
into kidney (Fig. 2C and D) and intestine (Fig. 2E and F). The
signiﬁcant reduction of paclitaxel administered without a
solubilizer (i.e., nab-paclitaxel) in the kidneys of OATP1B2
(/) mice at 5 minutes after drug administration is possibly
the result of low expression of OATP1B2 in renal cells of mice
(35), and a similar phenotype has been reported previously for
the OATP1B2 substrate, hydroxyurea (36). The concentrations
of paclitaxel in the intestine after the administration of nabpaclitaxel were not dependent on OATP1B2 genotype at the

OATP1B-Mediated Clearance of Paclitaxel

early time point, where appearance of the drug likely reﬂects
direct intestinal secretion (37). At the 2-hour time point, the
higher levels in the intestine are presumably the result of
hepatobiliary secretion becoming an increasingly dominant
contributor to the elimination of paclitaxel.
Effects of formulation and transport on taxane clearance
in vivo
As anticipated from the tissue distribution ﬁndings, the
plasma concentration–time proﬁles of paclitaxel were inversely related to corresponding drug levels in liver, and concentrations in plasma were consistently higher by 5- to 7-fold for the
CrEL-containing formulation compared with the other groups
(Fig. 3A and B). The notion that the slow clearance of paclitaxel
administered in CrEL is because of a distribution defect rather
than an event occurring in the terminal elimination phase is
also consistent with the observed terminal half-lives of paclitaxel that were not signiﬁcantly dependent on the formulation
or genotype (Supplementary Table S1).
After the administration of nab-paclitaxel, the peak plasma
concentration of paclitaxel was signiﬁcantly increased in
OATP1B2(/) mice, and this genotype dependence was
nulliﬁed in the presence of PS80 or CrEL (Fig. 3C). Based on
total area under the curve (AUC), a signiﬁcant but blunted
inﬂuence of genotype was still noted for PS80-based formulation, but not for CrEL (Fig. 3D). Because the same PS80

formulation is used in the clinical preparation of docetaxel
and cabazitaxel, we also evaluated the comparative plasma
pharmacokinetic properties of the two other approved taxanes
in the same mouse model. Studies performed in transfected
cells conﬁrmed that, like paclitaxel, docetaxel is a transported
substrate of OATP1B2 (21), but this was not noted under the
experimental conditions applied for cabazitaxel (Fig. 4A). The
lack of transport of cabazitaxel by OATP1B2 is somewhat
surprising considering its structural similarity with docetaxel,
both having a 10-deacetylbaccatin III backbone (3), and
because cabazitaxel has been reported to inhibit OATP1B1
and OATP1B3, albeit at relatively high concentrations (Jevtana
prescribing information, see http://products.sanoﬁ.us/jevtana/jevtana.pdf). As expected based on the in vitro studies,
the AUC (Fig. 4B) and plasma levels at the time points
evaluated were signiﬁcantly increased in the absence of
OATP1B2 for paclitaxel (formulated in PS80; Fig. 4C) and
docetaxel (Fig. 4D), but not for cabazitaxel (Fig. 4E).

Discussion
This study adds to a growing body of knowledge that solute
carriers belonging to the OATP1B family can have a dramatic
impact on the hepatocellular accumulation and systemic
clearance of structurally diverse anticancer drugs. Using

accumulation studies in multiple-transfected model systems,
paclitaxel was conﬁrmed to be a high-afﬁnity substrate for both
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. We found that the interaction of
paclitaxel with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 was strongly dependent on cell context, and this has obvious implications for
future screening strategies aimed at identifying novel substrates for these transporters. The relatively low Km observed
for paclitaxel transport by OATP1B1 suggests that this route of
entry into hepatocytes may be saturated ﬁrst, and this is
consistent with results obtained in humanized transgenic mice
indicating that OATP1B1 does not substantially contribute to
paclitaxel transport in vivo (15), when administered at an
intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg. Indeed, the Km for OATP1B1
of 0.408 mmol/L is substantially lower than the peak plasma
concentration of unbound paclitaxel in patients receiving nabpaclitaxel at the recommended dose of 260 mg/m2 (on average,
1.50 mmol/L), but much higher than that observed for paclitaxel
in CrEL at 175 mg/m2 (on average, 0.143 mmol/L; ref. 38). This
suggests that the contribution of OATP1B1 to the disposition of
paclitaxel in patients is likely to be dependent on the prescribed
product, in addition to the total dose and duration of infusion.

Our in vitro studies also conﬁrmed that paclitaxel and
docetaxel, but not cabazitaxel, are transported substrates of
mouse OATP1B2 and, for paclitaxel, rat OATP1B2, the amino
acid sequence of which is 81% identical to that of the murine
transporter. Moreover, the rodent OATP1B2 transporters
share more than 60% amino acid sequence homology to the
two human isoforms, and on the basis of their shared basolateral localization in hepatocytes and overlapping substrate
speciﬁcity (39), it is possible that, in the context of paclitaxel,
the rodent OATP1B2 fulﬁlls the same function in the liver as
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in humans. Based on this premise, we
evaluated the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel in a
mouse model with a genetic deletion of OATP1B2. One possible
limitation of this model is the fact that, unlike in humans,
mouse hepatocytes express multiple members of OATP1A
subfamily, related transporters that can potentially provide
compensatory restoration of function when OATP1B2 is lost
(40). Despite this limitation, compared with wild-type mice, the
systemic exposure to nab-paclitaxel, administered without
PS80 or CrEL, in the OATP1B2(/) mice was increased by
2.5-fold. Our previously reported gene expression proﬁling and

OATP1B-Mediated Clearance of Paclitaxel

enzyme activity measurements in liver samples exclude alterations in alternate transport mechanisms or metabolic pathways as a likely cause of the delayed clearance phenotype in
OATP1B2(/) mice (20). Thus, these ﬁndings suggest that
OATP1B2-mediated transport of paclitaxel is an important
process in the elimination of this drug in mice, depending on
the solubilizer used for drug formulation.
We previously reported that the presence of PS80, the
pharmaceutical vehicle used to solubilize docetaxel in clinical
preparations, even in relatively low amounts, can completely
nullify the genotype-dependent transport of docetaxel by
OATP1B1 (21), and similar ﬁndings have been reported for
CrEL, used in one of the clinical preparations of paclitaxel (19).
Based on our current in vitro and subsequent conﬁrmatory in
vivo studies, it seems that the interaction of paclitaxel with
OATP1B2 is strongly diminished in the presence of PS80 and
CrEL in a fashion that is consistent with the known disposition
properties of these respective solubilizers. It is interesting to
note that a previous study demonstrated that mice deﬁcient in
all Oatp1a and Oatp1b genes display a rather modest increase
(<2-fold) in concentrations of paclitaxel in plasma following
intravenous administration of a PS80-based formulation that is
very similar to our present ﬁndings (17). These authors speculated that the lack of differences in plasma levels of paclitaxel
early after its administration (up to 3.5 minutes) may be
because of saturation of Oatp1a/Oatp1b-mediated liver
uptake, and that this distribution process is predominantly
dependent on other uptake mechanisms. Our current ﬁndings
now provide an alternative explanation, where the initially high
levels of PS80 in plasma can cause both temporary partitioning
into a circulating PS80 microemulsion as well as directly inhibit
the transporters required for hepatocellular uptake. These two
mechanisms combined likely also explain the results obtained
for paclitaxel in the presence of CrEL, although here the former
mechanism clearly remains the dominant contributor to the
overall disposition phenotypes.
The present observation that PS80 and CrEL can directly
inhibit OATP1B-type transporters suggests that the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of carrier-released (free) paclitaxel is not
formulation independent. This ﬁnding contrasts previously
made assumptions (10), and may have important ramiﬁcation
for a proper interpretation of the clinical pharmacology of
paclitaxel. First, we previously found that several common,
naturally occurring genetic variants in OATP1B3 with impaired
function were not associated with the pharmacokinetics of
paclitaxel in a cohort of 90 patients with cancer receiving the
drug in a CrEL-based formulation (16). This somewhat unexpected observation is consistent with our current ﬁndings in
that the interaction of paclitaxel with OATP1B3 may be
masked by CrEL irrespective of an individual's genotypic
constitution. It also suggests that the impact of reduced
function variants of OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3 on the clearance of paclitaxel may be much more pronounced for CrELfree formulations of the drug, such as nab-paclitaxel.
Second, it can be postulated that intrinsic physiologic and
environmental variables inﬂuencing OATP1B1- or OATP1B3mediated uptake of paclitaxel into hepatocytes may have a
more profound inﬂuence on drug clearance for formulations

lacking solubilizers. For example, substrates of OATP1B1 and
OATP1B3 for which the liver is the main organ of elimination
are highly liable to drug interactions associated with these
transporters (41, 42). Although formal drug interaction studies
have not been performed to date with nab-paclitaxel, our
present ﬁndings strongly suggest that interactions at the level
of hepatocellular uptake mechanisms would be exacerbated
with a formulation like nab-paclitaxel. Conversely, CrEL may
act as a perpetrator in known pharmacokinetic interactions
involving other OATP1B substrates coadministered with paclitaxel in phase I clinical trials (reviewed in ref. 4), such as
etoposide (43), docetaxel (44), oxaliplatin (45), and SN-38 (46).
Third, OATP1B1 is expressed at relatively high levels in
tumors of the colon, endometrium, esophagus, lung, prostate, stomach, testis, and bladder, and both OATP1B1 and
OATP1B3 contribute to the in vitro cytotoxicity of paclitaxel
in ovarian cancer cells (29). Although systemic exposure to
free paclitaxel is believed to be the dominant driver of druginduced cytotoxicity at tumor sites (10), it is conceivable
that these transporters can contribute directly to tumoral
uptake and that this process can be inhibited by solubilizers
such as PS80 and CrEL, leading to diminished antitumor
activity. This possibility would be consistent with available
clinical data on the comparative efﬁcacy of the various
paclitaxel formulations (reviewed in ref. 10), and with preclinical ﬁndings suggesting that (i) the absorption rate
constant of paclitaxel uptake into tumors is dramatically
decreased in the presence of CrEL compared with nabpaclitaxel (47), and (ii) a tumor-delivery mechanism exists
for nab-paclitaxel that is independent of SPARC (48), a
matricellular glycoprotein produced by tumors and/or
neighboring stroma that facilitates the intracellular accumulation of intact albumin nanoparticles (49).
Collectively, our ﬁndings demonstrate the importance of
OATP1B-type solute carriers in the hepatic elimination of
paclitaxel, and indicate that solubilizers used in clinical
preparations of this agent can inhibit this process in a
time-dependent fashion. These results offer a mechanistic
basis for previously reported interrelationships of taxane
disposition with PS80 and CrEL, and suggest that the likelihood of drug–drug interactions mediated by these transporters is strongly dependent on the selected paclitaxel
formulation.
