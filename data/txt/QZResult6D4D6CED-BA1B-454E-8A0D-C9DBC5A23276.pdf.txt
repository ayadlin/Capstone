ABSTRACT
Objectives: To explore the genetic and molecular events that control subclones
exhibiting distinct invasive/migratory capacities derived from human epithelial
ovarian cancer (EOC) cell line A2780 and SKOV3.
Methods: Single-cell subclones were isolated and established that were derived
from the SKOV3 and A2780 cell lines through limiting dilution methodology. Transwell
insert assays and MTT assays were performed to screen and identify the subclones
exhibiting the highest and the lowest invasive/migratory capacities, and the selected
subclones were renamed as A-H (A2780 high), A-L (A2780 low), S-H (SKOV3 high),
and S-L (SKOV3 low). Their biological characteristics were evaluated. RNA-Seq was
conducted on the targeted subclones.
Results: Compared with their corresponding counterparts, A-H/S-H cells
exhibited significantly higher invasive/migratory capacities (P < 0.001 and = 0.001,
respectively). A-H/S-H cells displayed a clear reduction in doubling time (P = 0.004
and 0.001, respectively), and a significant increase in the percentage of cells in
S phase (P = 0.004 and 0.022, respectively). Additionally, the apoptotic rates of
A-H/S-H cells were significantly lower than those of A-L/S-L cells (P = 0.002 and
0.026, respectively). At both mRNA and protein levels, caspase-3 and caspase-7
expression were reduced but Bcl-2 expression was increased in A-H/S-H cells. The
TrkB (anoikis-related) and Beclin1 (autophagy-related) levels were consistently high
and low, respectively, in both A-H/S-H cells. Resistance to chemotherapy in vitro and
higher capacities on tumor formation in vivo was presented in both A-H/S-H cells.
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway components, PIK3CA, PIK3CD, AKT3, ECM1, GPCR, mTOR
and PRKCB were increased but that the Nur77 and PTEN were decreased in A-H/S-H
cells, identified by RNA-Seq and consistently confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot
analyses.
Conclusions: Heterogeneous cell subpopulations exhibiting distinct invasive and
migratory capacities co-exist within the SKOV3 and A2780 cell lines. PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway activation is associated with higher invasive and migratory capacities in
subpopulations of human ovarian cancer cell lines. Inhibiting this pathway may be
useful for the chemoprevention or treatment of EOC.

INTRODUCTION

were collected in the logarithmic growth phase, adjusted
to a density of 10 cells/ml, and then seeded into 96-well
plates (0.1 ml/well). Eight 96-well plates were seeded for
each cell line. The 96-well plates were observed under
a microscope, and wells containing a single cell were
marked. Single-cell subclones proliferated to a certain
density after culturing for 2–3 weeks; then, the subclones
were transferred to 48-well plates. The subclones
were successively transferred to 24-, 12- and 6-well
plates and, finally, to culture dishes. All of the subclones
were amplified, and back-up subclones were stored
in liquid nitrogen.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal
gynecologic malignancy [1]. Intratumoral heterogeneity
(ITH) has been attributed to treatment failure in many
human malignancies [2–4]. The divergence of cell
subpopulations in tumors confers a heterogeneous
genomic landscape with implications on clinical
prognosis, including the acquisition of metastatic
potential and chemotherapy resistance [5]. RNA-Seq
provides unprecedented possibilities for genomic
characterization; this technique has significantly advanced
our understanding of genomic organization, including
allele-specific expression, novel transcripts, and unique
isoforms [6]. RNA-Seq technology may be helpful in
identifying pathways and molecules that may be relevant
for therapeutic intervention in EOC.
Heterogeneity is a common phenomenon of parental
tumor cell lines, and highly metastatic tumor cell variants
pre-exist in parental tumor cell populations [7–9]. SKOV3
cells, which were isolated from ascites of a patient with
ovarian adenocarcinoma, are resistant to several cytotoxic
drugs, including cisplatin [10]. In contrast, A2780 cells,
which were derived from an adenocarcinoma patient prior
to treatment, are sensitive to cisplatin [11]. Both of these
two cell lines are popular research models for human EOC.
Based on previous studies, we isolated and established two
pairs of cell subclones exhibiting distinct invasive/migratory
capacities that were derived from the SKOV3 and A2780
cell lines. Each pair of subclones with the same hereditary
background served as a model of intra-tumor heterogeneity,
and consistent findings in these two EOC cell lines provided
additional convincing data. The present study aimed to
investigate the disparities in gene expression between
the targeted subclones using RNA-Seq. Determining the
genetic and molecular events that control the distinct
invasive/migratory capacities of these subclones will
facilitate our understanding of EOC treatment failure and
will lead to the development of more effective therapeutics.

Matrigel invasion assay and cell migration assay
Transwell insert assays and 3-(4, 5-dimethyl2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assays were performed to assess and compare
the invasive/migratory capacities of the subclones.
Polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate (PVP-free) filters
with a pore size of 8.0 μm, which were either uncoated
(migration assay) or coated (invasion assay) with
50 μl of Matrigel diluted 1:3 in serum-free RPMI-1640,
were placed in Transwell chambers. Cells (0.1 × 106)
in the logarithmic growth phase were suspended in
200 μl of serum-free RPMI-1640 and seeded in the
upper chambers of Matrigel-coated Transwell plates.
RPMI-1640 containing 20% FBS (600 μl) was added
to the lower chamber as a chemotactic factor. Each
subclone was seeded in triplicate. All of the Transwell
chambers were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h.
Non-invading cells that remained on the upper surface
of the filter were carefully removed with a swab. The
Transwell chambers were then immersed in 500 μl of
culture medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT and were
incubated in the dark at 37°C for 4 h. Then, the liquid
was discarded, 500 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was added, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for
10 min to fully dissolve the formazan crystals. The
absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a microplate
reader. Based on their absorbance values, the subclones
were classified into groups exhibiting high, moderate or
low invasive/migratory capacity. Groups exhibiting high
or low invasive/migratory capacity were retained and
re-subjected to the above test. The subclones exhibiting
the highest or the lowest invasive/migratory capacity
were identified based on repeated comparisons and were
renamed as A-H (A2780 high), A-L (A2780 low), S-H
(SKOV3 high), and S-L (SKOV3 low). To investigate the
stability of the invasive/migratory potential, populations of
the A-H, A-L, S-H, and S-L cells were serially passaged to
approximately the thirtieth generation, and the variation in
the invasive/migratory capacities of the targeted subclones
was evaluated.
The selected A-H, A-L, S-H, and S-L subclones
were ultimately evaluated and analyzed using the
following experimental procedures.

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere in a 5%
CO2 incubator.

MTT assays and growth curves

Kit. All of the primers are listed in S-Table 2. Real-time
PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500
Real-Time PCR System and a SuperReal PreMix Kit.
The results were analyzed using the 2(−ΔΔCT) comparative
method [13]. Each sample was tested in triplicate.

MTT assays were performed in 96-well plates. Cells
(2 × 103) were seeded in each well. Each subclone was
seeded in six wells of each 96-well plate (eight 96-well
plates in total). All of the 96-well plates were incubated at
37°C. One 96-well plate was removed from the incubator
each day. Twenty microliters of MTT (5 mg/ml MTT
in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) was added to each
well, and the plates were incubated in the dark at 37°C
for 4 h. The liquid was then discarded, and 200 μl of
DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The
optical density (OD) was measured at 490 nm using an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate
reader. The OD values for each subclone were recorded
each day. Growth curves were plotted, and the doubling
time was calculated.

Western blot
Cells were lysed in cold radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer containing freshly added 0.01%
protease inhibitor for 30 min. After the lysed cells were
incubated on ice for 10 min, they were centrifuged
at 12000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants
were collected. Approximately 50 μg of total protein
was denatured for 10 min at 95°C, separated on a
10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked
with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for 2 h at room temperature and
then incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.
The primary antibodies were detected by incubating
the membranes in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, and
the signals were visualized using a SuperEnhanced
Chemiluminescence Detection Kit. Details of the primary
and secondary antibodies are presented in S-Table 3. Each
assay was performed in triplicate.

Cell cycle distribution assays
The four subclones were collected in the logarithmic
growth phase and counted. A minimum of (5–10) × 105
cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml
of cold ethanol (−20°C), and then incubated at −20°C
for at least 30 min. The cells were centrifuged, and the
supernatant was discarded. After the cells were washed
twice with PBS, they were resuspended and stained with
500 μl of PBS solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium
iodide (PI), 100 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.2% Triton X-100.
The samples were incubated in the dark at 4°C for 30 min
and then analyzed via flow cytometry. Approximately
20,000 cells were examined per sample. This assay was
performed in triplicate.

Drug cytotoxicity assays
Cells were seeded at a density of 8,000 cells per well
in 96-well plates. After the cells were incubated for 24 h,
they were treated with different concentrations of cisplatin
and taxol. MTT assays were performed after a 48-h
incubation. Dose-response curves were then generated,
and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were
calculated. Each assay was performed in triplicate.

Apoptotic rates of A-H, A-L, S-H and S-L
The apoptotic rates were measured using an
Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection Kit. Cells were
collected in the logarithmic growth phase, washed twice
with cold PBS, and adjusted to a density of 1 × 106/ml in
1× binding buffer. The cell suspension (100 μl) was placed
in a Falcon tube and was sequentially incubated in annexin
V-FITC (5 μl) followed by PI (5 μl) at 20°C–25°C in the
dark for 15 min. Then, 1× binding buffer (400 μl) was
added, and the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry
within one hour.

Ovarian tumor xenograft model in nude mice
Female BALB/c nude mice (4–5 weeks-old)
were maintained in micro-isolator cages. Forty mice
were randomly divided into 4 groups of 10 mice each.
Xenografts were established by subcutaneously injecting
the mice with 1 × 106 cells. The tumor volumes were
estimated using the formula (width)2 × length/2. The
mice were euthanized after 30 days of observation, and
the tumors were harvested. All procedures were reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

RNA isolation and real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR)
The mRNA and protein levels of caspase-3,
caspase-7, and Bcl-2 (apoptosis-related factors),
TrkB
(anoikis-related
factor),
and
Beclin1
(autophagy-related factor) were detected. Total RNA
was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, and cDNA was then
synthesized using a QuantScript Reverse Transcription
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Transcriptome expression profiling
First, the library for Illumina sequencing was prepared.
Briefly, 150 μg of total RNA was extracted from each sample
using TRIzol reagent, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The quality of the extracted RNA was evaluated
25522

Oncotarget

via 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and PI taining. The
extracted RNA was then dissolved in RNase-free water
and purified using an RNeasy Mini RNA Purification
Kit. Illumina-compatible libraries were constructed using
a TruSeq RNA library preparation kit. Briefly, mRNA
was purified from the extracted RNA using oligo-dT
magnetic beads and was fragmented. First-strand cDNA
was synthesized using random hexamers and reverse
transcriptase. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized using
high quality deoxyribo nucleotide triphos phates (dNTPs),
ribonuclease H (RNase H), and DNA polymerase. Doublestranded (ds) cDNA was synthesized via PCR amplification
using sequencing adaptors. Fragments of 250–500 bp were
selected, subjected to 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis,
excised from the gels, and purified using a Qiagen Gel
Extraction Kit. The final library was sequenced on a
HiSeq™ 2000 platform (Illumina).
Second, the obtained raw reads were analyzed by
trimming, filtering, and the sequences aligning to the
human genome (hg19) using TopHat (version 1.3.3) [14];
Cufflinks software (version 1.2.1) [15] was used to identify
the differentially expressed genes. The transcript counts
were calculated to measure gene expression, and the
relative transcript abundance was assessed as fragments
per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped
(FPKM) using Cufflinks software (version  1.2.1) [15].
Transcripts displaying a P-value < 0.05 and a-fold change
in expression > 2.0 were considered to be significantly
differentially expressed.
RT-PCR and Western blot analyses were performed
to validate genes that exhibited significant differential
expression in the RNA-Seq data for the targeted subclones.
The primers and antibodies used are shown in S-Table 2
and S-Table 3, respectively.

4 days after inoculation. These single-cell subclones
significantly differed in cell number and subclone size ten
days after inoculation.
For the A2780 cell line, single adherent cells were
observed in 258 wells of the eight 96-well plates. Of
these 258 single-cell clones, 166 died and disappeared,
and 16 were eliminated due to bacterial contamination.
Of the remaining 76 single-cell clones, 18 died and
disappeared, and 13 were subsequently eliminated due to
bacterial contamination during the transfer process from
96-well plates to 48-, 24-, 12-, and 6- well plates and,
ultimately, to culture dishes. For the A2780 subclones, the
contamination rate was 11.2%, and the mortality rate was
80.3%. Forty-five (17.4%) cell subclones were obtained
and named A1–A45. For the SKOV3 cell line, single
adherent cells were observed in 288 wells of the eight
96-well plates. Of these 288 single-cell clones, 148 died
and disappeared, and 20 were eliminated due to bacterial
contamination. Forty (19.2%) single-cell subclones were
obtained and named S1–S40.
In the Matrigel invasive/migratory assay, subclone
A6 (A-H) demonstrated the highest invasive/migratory
activities, and subclone A41 (A-L) displayed the weakest
ability to invade and migrate through the membrane
(migration: 2.118 ± 0.161 vs. 0.162 ± 0.099, P < 0.001;
invasion: 2.340 ± 0.322 vs. 0.350 ± 0.082, P = 0.001;
Fig. 1C).The invasive/migratory abilities of A-H and
A-L both were significantly different from those of their
parental cell line (A-H vs. parental: P = 0.001/0.002;
A-L vs. parental: P = 0.044/0.001). Similarly,
S15 (S-H) and S4 (S-L) exhibited most distinct
invasive/migratory abilities (invasion: 1.416 ± 0.127
vs. 0.261 ± 0.106, P = 0.001; migration: 1.726 ± 0.168
vs. 0.254 ± 0.082, P < 0.001) among all of the SKOV3
subclones. The invasive/migratory capacities of
both S-H and S-L were significantly different from
those of their parental cell line (S-H vs. parental:
P = 0.019/0.018; S-L vs. parental: P = 0.037/0.018).
The respective invasive/migratory capacities of A-H,
A-L, S-H, and S-L were not significantly altered
by serial passaging to approximately the thirtieth
generation (Fig. 1D). After passaging to approximately
30 generations, the difference in invasive/migratory
capacities between A-H/S-H and A-L/S-L remained
significant (invasion: P = 0.015/P < 0.001; migration:
P < 0.001/P < 0.001). These results indicated that the
selected subclones had relatively stable biological traits.
However, the invasive/migratory capacities of these
subclones were slightly increased following passaging
for thirty generations, with the exception of the migratory
capacity of A-L, which decreased slightly, possibly
due to experimental error. Consequently, subclones in
similar generations were used, unnecessary passaging
was avoided, and subclones in no greater than the
20th generation were used in the further comparative
analyses.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS®
Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All tests were
2-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant. The invasive/migratory capacities, cell
doubling time, and tumor volumes were compared using
two- tailed independent- sample t tests. Chi-square tests
or Fisher’s exact tests were performed to compare the
apoptotic rates and cell cycle distribution.

RESULTS
Establishment of subclones exhibiting distinct
invasive/migratory capacity
Single adherent A2780/SKOV3 cells were
observed as early as 4–5 h after isolation and inoculation
(Fig. 1A and 1B). Single cells began to divide, and
2–3 cells were observed in some wells of the plates 24 h
after inoculation. The cell number continued to increase

began to divide, and 2–3 cells were observed in some wells of the plates 24 h after inoculation (b). The cell number continued to increase
4 days after inoculation (c). These single-cell subclones significantly differed in cell number of and subclone size ten days after inoculation
(d1and d2). C. In the Matrigel invasive/migratory assay, subclone A6 (A-H) demonstrated the highest invasive/migratory activity, and
subclone A41 (A-L) displayed the weakest ability to invade and migrate through the membrane (P < 0.001 and = 0.001, respectively). The
invasive/migratory abilities of A-H and A-L both were significantly different from those of their parent cell line (A-H vs. A2780: P = 0.001
and 0.002, respectively; A-L vs. A2780: P = 0.044 and 0.001, respectively). Similarly, S15 (S-H) and S4 (S-L) exhibited the most distinct
invasive/migratory abilities (P = 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively) among all the SKOV3 subclones. The invasive/migratory capacities
of both S-H and S-L were significantly different from those of their parent cell line (S-H vs. SKOV3: P = 0.019 and 0.018, respectively;
S-H vs. SKOV3: P = 0.037 and 0.018, respectively). D. The respective invasive/migratory capacities of A-H, A-L, S-H, and S-L were
not significantly altered by serial passaging to approximately the thirtieth generation. After passaging to approximately 30 generations,
the difference in the invasive/migratory capacities between A-H/S-H and A-L/S-L remained significant (invasion: P = 0.015 and < 0.001,
respectively; migration: P < 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively).

Heterogeneous biological functions between
A-H/S-H and A-L/S-L

enhanced proliferation of A-H/S-H cells might be due to
the activation of DNA synthesis (Fig. 2C).
The apoptotic rates of A-H/S-H cells were
significantly lower than those of A-L/S-L cells
(A: 0.57 ± 0.05% vs. 1.23 ± 0.06%, P = 0.002; S: 0.73 ±
0.05% vs. 1.17 ± 0.05%, P = 0.026; Fig. 3A). At both
the mRNA and protein levels, caspase-3 and caspase-7
expression was reduced but Bcl-2 expression was
increased in A-H/S-H cells (Fig. 3B). Additionally, the
TrkB and Beclin1 levels were consistently high and low,
respectively, in both A-H and S-H cells. Compared with
their corresponding counterparts, the A-H and S-H cells
exhibited significantly greater proliferative, anti-apoptotic
and anti-anoikis activities. Moreover, autophagic activity
was suppressed in the A-H and S-H subclones.

The MTT assay growth curves showed that
A-H/S-H cells proliferated faster than A-L/S-L cells,
based on a clear reduction in the doubling time (A: 25.88 ±
2.29 h vs. 59.58 ± 4.96 h, P = 0.004; S: 33.10 ± 1.19 h vs.
46.74 ± 2.31 h, P = 0.001; Fig. 2A, 2B). Cell cycle analysis
indicated that the A-H and S-H subclones displayed a
significant increase in the percentage of cells in S phase
(A: 50.67 ± 2.78% vs. 39.31 ± 1.73%, P = 0.004; S: 49.91
± 3.96% vs. 39.96 ± 2.62%, P = 0.022) and a concomitant
decrease in the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase
(A: 44.60 ± 3.10% vs. 53.87 ± 1.94%, P = 0.012; S: 37.61
± 3.55% vs. 51.18 ± 3.03%, P = 0.007), suggesting that the

Transcriptome expression profiling according to
the heterogeneous invasive/migratory capacities
of human ovarian cancer cell lines

Cell viability after cisplatin or taxol treatment
was significantly inhibited in A-L/S-L cells
compared with A-H/S-H cells, as demonstrated by
drug cytotoxicity assays (Fig. 3C). The subclones
showing higher invasive/migratory capacities (A-H/
S-H) displayed markedly higher cisplatin IC50 values
(invasion: 2.83 ± 0.07 μg/ml vs. 0.37 ± 0.002 μg/ml, P < 0.001;
migration: 2.70 ± 0.08 μg/ml vs.  0.58 ± 0.05 μg/ml,
P < 0.001). Similarly, the respective taxol IC50 values of
A-H and S-H cells were 0.095 ± 0.004 μg/ml and 0.074 ±
0.006 μg/ml, which were significantly higher than those of
A-L cells (0.010 ± 0.004 μg/ml, P = 0.002) and S-L cells
(0.021 ± 0.001 μg/ml, P = 0.002). The subclones exhibiting
higher invasive/migratory capacities were more resistant to
chemotherapy

RNA-Seq was conducted on the A-H, A-L, S-H
and /S-L cells. In total, approximately13.0, 12.7, 10.6 and
7.9 million raw reads with a length of 75 bp were obtained
for the A-H, A-L, S-H and /S-L subclones, respectively;
excluding the reads lacking an anchored oligo-dT,
approximately 11.0, 11.1, 8.4 and 6.3 million reads,
respectively, remained that uniquely mapped to the human
nuclear genome. In total, 612 genes were significantly
differentially expressed in A-H cells compared with
A-L cells, and 594 genes were differentially expressed
genes were identified in S-H cells compared with S-L
cells (P < 0.05 and fold-change in expression >2.0;
Fig. 4A, S-Table 4, and S-Table 5). Among these cell
lines, the expression of 24 genes was increased and
that of 7 genes was decreased in both A-H and S-H
cells compared with A-L and S-L cells, respectively.
Twenty-five of the 31 genes are known to be involved
in cancer. To investigate the functions of these genes in
signal transduction in tumor cells, Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was
performed, and 5 differentially expressed genes were
identified, including AKT3, ECM1, LPAR1 (also known
as GPCR), NR4A1 (also known as NUR77), and PRKCB.
These genes participate in the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway.
These 5 differentially expressed genes, together with PIK
(including the PIK3CA and PIK3CD subtypes), mTOR

Effect of heterogeneous invasive/migratory
capacities on tumor formation in vivo
After subcutaneous injection, A-H/S-H tumors
were observed much earlier than A-L/S-L tumors
(5th day vs. 19th day; 7th day vs. 20th day; Fig. 3D).
On the study end date (30 days after inoculation), the
tumor formation rates of both the A-H and S-H cells

Figure 3: Heterogeneous biological activities of A-H/A-L and S-H/S-L. A–B. The apoptotic rates of A-H/S-H cell were

significantly lower than those of A-L/S-L cells (P = 0.002 and 0.026, respectively; A). At both the mRNA (a) and protein levels (b),
caspase-3 and caspase-7 expression was reduced, but Bcl-2 expression was increased in A-H/S-H cells (B) Additionally, the TrkB and
Beclin1 levels were consistently high and low, respectively, in both A-H and S-H cells. Compared with their corresponding counterparts,
the A-H and S-H cells exhibited significantly greater proliferative, anti-apoptotic and anti-anoikis activities. Autophagic activity was
suppressed in the A-H and S-H subclones. C. Cell viability after cisplatin or taxol treatment was significantly inhibited in A-L/S-L cells
compared with A-H/S-H cells, as demonstrated by drug cytotoxicity assays. The sublones showing higher invasive/migratory capabilities
(A-H/S-H) displayed markedly higher cisplatin IC50 values (P < 0.001 and < 0.0001, respectively). Similarly, the respective taxol IC50
values of A-H and S-H cells respectively were significantly higher than those of A-L cells and S-L cells (P = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively).
The sublones exhibiting higher invasive/migratory capacities were more resistant to chemotherapy. D. Effect of heterogeneous invasive/
migratory capacities for tumor formation in vivo. (a): After subcutaneous injection, A-H/S-H tumors were observed much earlier than
A-L/S-L tumors (5th day vs. 19th day; 7th day vs. 20th day). (b-d): On the study end date (30 days after inoculation), the tumor formation
rates of both the A-H/S-H cells were 100%, and these were significantly higher than those of the A-L and S-L cells, respectively (both 20%,
P = 0.008) (b). Additionally, the A-H/S-H tumors were significantly larger than the A-L/S-L tumors (A: 2.34 ± 0.23 cm vs. 0.17 ± 0.33 cm,
P < 0.001; S: 2.04 ± 0.61cm vs. 0.12 ± 0.27cm, P < 0.001). The A-H/S-H cells exhibited higher capacities for in vivo tumor formation.

and PTEN, which play pivotal roles in this pathway,
were selected for further verification (Fig. 4B, Table 1).
RT-PCR and Western blot analyses consistently confirmed
that the PIK3CA, PIK3CD, AKT3, ECM1, GPCR, mTOR
and PRKCB levels were increased, whereas Nur77 and
PTEN levels were decreased in A-H/S-H cells compared
with A-L/S-L cells (Fig. 5).

invasive and migratory capacities, respectively. The
existence of heterogeneous subpopulations within one
tumor cell line was validated.
Tumor cells must acquire the migration ability
to invade tissues or vessels. Human tumors are
heterogeneous; a selective advantage of the collective
invasion of tumor cells could be that cell clones
with different properties such as active proliferative,
migratory and survival abilities could collaborate and
support each other to metastasize successfully [20]. The
present study demonstrated that subclones displaying
high invasive and migratory capacities exhibited more
aggressive phenotypes. A-H and S-H cells proliferated
significantly faster, had a shorter doubling time,
and included a larger proportion of cells in S phase
compared with their corresponding counterparts. The
apoptotic rates of A-H and S-H cells were notably lower
than those of A-L and S-L cells. At both the mRNA and

DISCUSSION
Accumulating evidence in the literature [16, 17]
and from our previous studies [18, 19] has demonstrated
that tumor heterogeneity exists in EOC. In this study,
using limiting dilution methodology and routine culture
conditions, 45 subclones were isolated and established
from the A2780 cell line, and 40 subclones were acquired
from the SKOV3 cell line. A-H/S-H and A-L/S-L cells
were identified as exhibiting the highest and lowest

A-H, A-L, S-H and S-L cells. In total, 612 genes were significantly differentially expressed in A-H cells compared with A-L cells, and
594 genes were differentially expressed genes were identified in S-H cells compared with S-L cells (P < 0.05 and fold change > 2.0).
B. The PI3K pathway plays a pivotal role in many human malignancies [34, 35]. The extracellular matrix (ECM) activates focal adhesion
kinases (FAKs), and the PI3K pathway can be activated by FAKs [37]. High ECM1 expression has been correlated with poor prognosis and
metastatic potential in human carcinomas [38, 39]. The most studied type I PI3Ks include the α, β, γ and δ subtypes; mutations or abnormal
expression of PI3Kα(PIK3CA) are the most commonly reported in cancer [41, 42]. PI3Kγ(PIK3CD) is activated by only stimulated
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) [43]. The survival mechanism initiated via PI3K is primarily activated through AKT. Increased AKT
activation exerts anti-apoptotic effect, antagonizes cell cycle arrest, modulates angiogenesis, and activates mRNA translation via mTOR
signaling [50]. P-TEN inhibits PI3K pathway activity [51, 52]. Under the regulation of AKT, Nur77 induces a conformational change in
Bcl-2 and promotes apoptosis [54]. Additionally, PKC is located in downstream of mTOR. The β isoform of PKC (PRKCB) might play
significant roles in promoting human breast cancers growth [55, 56].

protein levels, reduced expression of caspase-3 and
caspase-7 (pro-apoptotic factors [21]) and increased
expression of Bcl-2 (an anti-apoptotic factor [22]) were
observed in A-H/S-H cells. Overall, A-H/S-H cells
exhibited enhanced proliferative and anti-apoptotic
activities.
Anoikis can hamper metastasis by inducing
apoptosis when tumor cells enter foreign environments.
Anoikis tolerance is a prerequisite for tumor metastasis
[23]. TrkB, a neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor, is a
potent and specific suppressor of anoikis that activates
the PI3K/PKB pathway [24, 25]. TrkB is frequently
over-expressed in ovarian cancer and in other human
cancers, particularly those with aggressive behavior
and a poor prognosis [23, 26]. Our data showed that
TrkB was over-expressed in the subclones exhibiting
high invasive and migratory capacities. These findings
illustrate the feasibility of using anoikis suppression as
a functional property to identify metastasis-associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

oncogenes and highlight its potential use in
high-throughput screens for TrkB-inhibitory cancer
therapeutics [25].
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved protein
degradation pathway in eukaryotes and is essential for
cell survival under nutrient-limited conditions [27].
The exact role of autophagy in cancer is complex and
paradoxical, varying in distinct tumor types and stages,
as well as in separate regions of the same tumor [28, 29].
Beclin1 recruits proteins from the cytosol for autophagic
degradation and supplies the autophagic pathway with
membrane components. Beclin 1 expression is directly
correlates with autophagosome formation [30]. In addition
to interacting with PI3K, Beclin 1 binds to the Bcl-2
family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [31]. Thus, autophagy
is often activated together with apoptosis in response
to stress. Beclin1 is monoallelically deleted in human
ovarian, breast and prostate cancers [32, 33]. In the present
study, Beclin1 expression was decreased in subclones

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a potential
predictor of invasive/migratory capacity in
human ovarian cancer cell lines

exhibiting high invasive/migratory capability. The
synergy between autophagic defects and altered apoptotic
activity might facilitate malignant differentiation and a
more aggressive EOC phenotype.
In addition to enhanced proliferative, anti-apoptotic
and anti-anoikis activities and suppressed autophagic
activity, A-H/S-H cells exhibited significant resistance
to cisplatin and taxol in vitro and a higher capacity
for tumor formation in vivo compared with A-L/S-L
cells. The subclones displaying high invasive and
migratory capacities showed significantly greater
anchorage-independent growth viability.

In the two pairs of targeted subclones, 5 of the
differentially expressed genes revealed via RNA-Seq,
i.e., ECM1, GPCR, NUR 77, AKT (AKT3) and PKC
(PRKCB), are PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway components.
The PI3K pathway is involved in stimulating cell
proliferation and migration and in inhibiting apoptosis;
additionally, this pathway plays a pivotal role in many
human malignancies [34–36]. The extracellular matrix

(ECM), a series of glycosylated proteins that are secreted
extracellularly, activates focal adhesion kinases (FAKs),
and FAK activity is primarily are mediated by integrins.
The PI3K pathway can be activated by FAKs [37]. High
ECM1 expression has been correlated with poor prognosis
and metastatic potential in human carcinomas [38, 39].
PI3K is the central link in the PI3K/AKT pathway;
therefore, PI3K plays a crucial role in this pathway.
The most studied type I PI3Ks include the α, β, γ and δ
subtypes [40]; mutations or abnormal expression of PI3Kα
(PIK3CA) are most commonly reported in cancer [41, 42].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PI3Kγ (PIK3CD) is activated by only stimulated G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs) [43], and its role in cancer is
controversial [44, 45]. Xie et al. [46] demonstrated that
increased PI3Kγ activity propagates the metastatic signal
initiated by GPCRs in breast cancer cells.
The survival mechanism initiated via PI3K is
primarily activated through AKT. Increased AKT
activation has been noted observed in high-grade and
late-stage serous ovarian cancer [47–49], in which
AKT exerts anti-apoptotic effects, antagonizes cell cycle
arrest, modulates angiogenesis, and activates mRNA

translation via mTOR signaling [50]. P-TEN, a candidate
tumor-suppressor gene, inhibits PI3K pathway activity
[51, 52]. An activating PIK3CA mutation coupled with
PTEN loss is sufficient to initiate ovarian tumorigenesis
in mice [53]. Under the regulation of AKT, the orphan
nuclear receptor Nur77 induces a conformational change
in Bcl-2 and promotes apoptosis [54]. Additionally, PKC
is located downstream of mTOR. The β isoforms of PKC
(PRKCB) might play significant roles in promoting human
breast cancer growth [55, 56].
Briefly, the 5 differentially expressed genes that
were identified by RNA-Seq, as well as PIK (PIK3CA and
PIK3CD subtypes), mTOR and PTEN, which function in
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, were selected for further
validation of the RNA-Seq results. RT-PCR and Western
blot analyses consistently confirmed that PIK3CA,
PIK3CD, AKT3, ECM1, GPCR, mTOR and PRKCB
expression was increased but that Nur77 and PTEN
expression was decreased in A-H/S-H cells compared
with A-L/S-L cells. PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation
was associated with enhanced invasive and migratory
capacities in human ovarian cancer cell lines.

CONCLUSIONS
Heterogeneous cell subpopulations exhibiting
distinct invasive and migratory capacities co-exist
within human ovarian cancer cell lines. The subclones
displaying higher invasive and migratory capacities
exhibit significantly increased independent viability,
which might play an important role in tumor metastasis
and chemotherapeutic resistance. PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway activation is associated with higher invasive and
migratory capacities in subpopulations of human ovarian
cancer cell lines. Inhibiting this pathway may be useful for
the chemoprevention or treatment of EOC.
