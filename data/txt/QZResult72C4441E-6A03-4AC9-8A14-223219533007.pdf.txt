ABSTRACT
Podoplanin/Aggrus is a sialoglycoprotein expressed in various cancers. We
previously identified podoplanin as a key factor in tumor-induced platelet aggregation.
Podoplanin-mediated platelet aggregation enhances tumor growth and metastasis
by secreting growth factors and by forming tumor emboli in the microvasculature.
Thus, precise analysis of the mechanisms of podoplanin-mediated platelet aggregation
is critical for developing anti-tumor therapies. Here we report the discovery of a
novel platelet aggregation-inducing domain, PLAG4 (81-EDLPT-85). PLAG4 has high
homology to the previously reported PLAG3 and contributes to the binding of its
platelet receptor CLEC-2. Mutant analyses indicated that PLAG4 exhibits a predominant
platelet-aggregating function relative to PLAG3 and that conserved Glu81/Asp82/Thr85
residues in PLAG4 are indispensable for CLEC-2 binding. By establishing anti-PLAG4neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, we confirmed its role in CLEC-2 binding, platelet
aggregation, and tumor emboli formation. Our results suggest the requirement of
simultaneous inhibition of PLAG3/4 for complete suppression of podoplanin-mediated
tumor growth and metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

triggered by tumor–platelet interaction, this interaction
could be a promising target for cancer therapy.
We have previously identified a type-I transmembrane
sialoglycoprotein, podoplanin, also known as Aggrus, as a
platelet aggregation-inducing factor in highly metastatic
tumor cells [6]. Podoplanin expression induces platelet
aggregation, and experimental and spontaneous pulmonary
metastasis [3, 6]. Podoplanin is frequently overexpressed
in various malignant tumors such as squamous cell
carcinoma, mesothelioma, glioblastoma, bladder tumors,
and osteosarcoma [7–11]. Therefore, the platelet-interaction
and the platelet-aggregating ability of podoplanin may be a
target for suppressing metastasis in clinical situations.
Podoplanin contains three tandemly repeated
EDXXVTPG motifs in the extracellular domain. Analysis
of the epitope of a neutralizing anti-mouse podoplanin
monoclonal antibody (mAb) 8F11 helped to identify the
domains critical for exhibiting platelet-aggregating ability.
Therefore, we designated the motif-containing domain
(EDXXVTPG; in which “X” may be any amino acid) as

Tumor cell growth and survival are affected by
a wide variety of tumor microenvironments. During
hematogenous metastasis processes, circulating tumor
cells rarely survive due to exclusion by the immune
system. Platelets are known as the critical component
that affects the survival of circulating tumor cells,
leading to metastasis formation [1]. In fact, anti-platelet
agents and thrombocytopenia reduce tumor metastasis in
experimental models [2, 3]. Moreover, the administration
of anti-coagulants has been reported to lower the mortality
rate [4, 5]. The following mechanisms underlying plateletpromoting metastasis are proposed: (i) enhancement
of tumor cell embolization in the microvasculature by
the formation of large tumor cell-platelet aggregates,
(ii) up-regulation of tumor malignancy by the release of
soluble factors from activated platelets, and (iii) protection
from immunological assault or blood shear stress by
coating of the tumor cell surface [1]. As all pathways are

the PLatelet AGgregation-stimulating (PLAG) domain
(PLAG1–3) [6]. These domains are highly conserved
among mammals in a triplicated manner. The PLAG1
and/or PLAG3 domain contains a predicted glycosylated
Thr residue that is critical for podoplanin activity [3, 6, 12].
O-glycanase treatment reduces podoplanin’s platelet
aggregation ability [13], and studies using a series of
glycosylation-deficient CHO cell mutants and genetically
modified yeast suggest the requirement of sialylated
O-glycan for podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation
[14, 15]. In fact, a disialyl-core structure on Thr52 in
PLAG3 has been detected in human podoplanin [16].
The C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2),
originally identified as a platelet receptor for the snake
venom toxin rhodocytin [17], has been identified as a
podoplanin receptor [18]. Podoplanin binding to CLEC-2
transmits platelet-activation signals through Src family
kinases, Syk, and phospholipase Cγ2 in platelets
[17, 19]. CLEC-2-deficient platelets can still respond to
platelet agonists, such as collagen and ADP, suggesting
the possibility that the interfering podoplanin–CLEC-2
interaction may not affect physiological hemostasis [20].
Till date, we and another group have generated several
PLAG domain-recognizing anti-human podoplanin mAbs
that suppress podoplanin binding to CLEC-2, platelet
aggregation, and hematogenous metastasis [21–23].
Because our generated anti-podoplanin neutralizing
mAbs, P2–0 and MS-1, recognized Gly45 in PLAG2 and
Asp48 and Asp49 in PLAG3, the perimeter structure around
PLAG2 and PLAG3 could be the CLEC-2-binding site
[22, 23]. A recent report on the crystal structure of human
podoplanin-derived O-glycosylated PLAG2–PLAG3
peptide in complex with CLEC-2 extracellular domain
revealed that the acidic side chains of Glu47, Asp48, and the
sialic acid attached to Thr52 on PLAG3 were recognized by
basic residues on CLEC-2 [24].
Here we report the discovery of an additional PLAG
domain (81–85 aa in human podoplanin), which is highly
conserved among mammals. The region includes the
highly conserved EDXXT motif, which is closely related
to the PLAG domain consensus sequence EDXXVTPG.
Deletion of the region or a point mutation in it drastically
attenuated its binding to CLEC-2 and podoplanin-induced
platelet aggregation. Thus, we designated the region as
the fourth PLAG domain, PLAG4. Importantly, deletions
or point mutations in both PLAG3 and PLAG4 domains
almost completely suppressed the CLEC-2-binding ability
and platelet-aggregating activity of human podoplanin,
whereas the deletion of or point mutation in either one of
the two domains could not completely suppress the binding
ability and platelet-aggregating ability. To further investigate
the requirement of the PLAG4 domain for podoplanin’s
platelet-aggregating ability, we tried to establish PLAG4recognizing mAbs. The generated PLAG4-recognizing
mAbs exhibited CLEC-2-binding inhibitory activity and
platelet aggregation-neutralizing ability. Moreover, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

injection of the mAbs suppressed podoplanin-mediated
hematogenous metastasis in vivo. These results suggest that
the newly identified PLAG4 domain plays a critical role
in the binding to CLEC-2, hence being a promising target
motif for suppressing podoplanin-expressing tumor cell
growth and metastasis.

RESULTS
Identification of a novel CLEC-2-binding
domain on human podoplanin
We previously identified that podoplanin contains
three tandemly repeated PLAG domains (PLAG1–3,
Figure 1A) that are critical to its platelet aggregationinducing ability [6]. In addition, glycosylations on
podoplanin are reported to be essential for its platelet
aggregation-inducing ability [14, 15]. To evaluate their
contributions to CLEC-2 binding, we estimated the
recombinant CLEC-2 binding to CHO cells that had
been transfected with a PLAG1- or PLAG3-deleted
podoplanin cDNA-containing plasmid. We generated a
PLAG1-deletion mutant by deleting the 29–34 aa-coding
region and a PLAG3-deletion mutant by deleting the
47–52 aa-coding region (Figure 1B). We confirmed that the
expression level of wild type (WT) or deleted podoplanin
was almost the same among the transfectants (Figure 1C,
left panels). Surprisingly, the ∆29–34/PLAG1 deletion
did not affect the binding of podoplanin to CLEC-2
(Figure 1C, right panels). Interestingly, the deletion of
∆47–52/PLAG3 could not abrogate podoplanin binding
to CLEC-2 but only showed a partial reduction of its
binding capability (Figure 1C, right panels). These
results suggest that other regions in podoplanin may be
associated with the binding to CLEC-2. We therefore
analyzed the highly conserved regions of mammalian
podoplanin amino acid sequences (Figure 1D).
Sequences of 42 mammalian species retrieved from
the NCBI Reference Sequence Database were selected
(Supplementary Figure S1), and data were analyzed
using sliding-window analysis and hydropathy plots
(Figure 1D). Apart from the N-terminal signal peptide,
we found four highly conserved regions within the
extracellular domain (red dotted lines in Figure 1D).
Three out of four regions contained highly negativecharged motifs, and the forth conserved region did not
(hydropathy plots in Figure 1D). We studied them in detail
and found that the three acidic regions were composed of
two negatively charged amino acids followed by a Thr
residue (Figure 1E) and that the forth region contained a
completely different conserved sequence TSHS (106–109
aa). Consequently, the first region was identified as the
PLAG1 domain, the second region was located in the
PLAG3 domain, and the third region was located in the
middle region (81–85 aa). Because no analysis of the third
region had been carried out thus far, we further analyzed

anti-PLAG4 monoclonal antibodies

its role in CLEC-2 binding and platelet aggregation. We
established CHO cells that had been transfected with
∆81–85-podoplanin and examined its ability to bind to
CLEC-2 (Figure 1B and 1C). Surprisingly, the deletion
of 81–85 aa attenuated the CLEC-2-binding ability more
than the ∆47–52/PLAG3 deletion, and the double deletion
of ∆47–52/PLAG3 and ∆81–85 almost completely
suppressed the binding capability. Deletion of 81–85
aa residues did not affect the membrane localization or
expression level (Figure 1C). Thus, we speculated that
this locus was associated with CLEC-2 binding, similarly
to our previously reported PLAG domain. We therefore
designated the region as the “PLAG4” domain (Figure 1E).

To further estimate the role of the PLAG4 domain in
podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation and in pulmonary
metastasis promoted by platelet aggregation, we attempted
to establish a mouse mAb recognizing the PLAG4
domain. We purified a 12- or 40-times tandemly repeated
human podoplanin PLAG4 peptide (TGIRIEDLPTSEST;
76–89 aa) as an antigen from a bacteria lysate and
immunized the mice with the peptide. After fusing
splenocytes with P3U1 myeloma cells, we screened
hybridomas that secreted mAbs recognizing the
immunogen, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA)-based competition analysis. Upon further
selection by recognition capability for podoplaninexpressing CHO/PDPN cells, but not for CHO/mock cells,
we finally obtained two anti-PLAG4 mAbs, designated
PG4D1 and PG4D2. The epitopes of PG4D1 and
PG4D2 were identified by examining their reactivity to
recombinant human ∆N24-podoplanin expressed in E. coli
harboring point mutations of each amino acid to Ala
(Ala scanning; Figure 3A). We confirmed that PG4D1
and PG4D2 mAbs recognized the perimeter structure
from Arg79 to Leu83 (Figure 3A). Each amino acid from
Arg79 to Leu83 was required for PG4D1 mAb recognition
of human podoplanin. Within the recognition epitope,
Arg79, Ile80, Glu81, and Leu83 residues were required for
PG4D2 recognition to podoplanin, whereas the Asp82
residue appeared to be less effective than other amino
acids because PG4D2 mAb could weakly recognize D82A
mutant (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S3A). We
confirmed that both mAbs specifically recognized the
PLAG4 domain using PLAG deletion mutants (Figure 3B).
The subclasses of PG4D1 and PG4D2 mAbs were
identified to be IgG1 and IgG2a, respectively (data not
shown). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis
revealed that both mAbs exhibited a high affinity to human
podoplanin (Figure 3C). The dissociation rate constant
(kd) of both mAbs failed to reach values measurable by
Biacore X100 due to the low level of dissociation, and so
the precise equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values
could not be determined. However, the KD values of both
mAbs were less than 0.3 nM.

Critical roles of PLAG4 domain in CLEC-2
binding and platelet aggregation
To exclude the possibility that the deletion of
domains affected 3D conformation, potentially leading
to changes in the CLEC-2 interaction surface, we tried to
generate human podoplanin point mutants exhibiting low
affinity to CLEC-2. Our previously established neutralizing
anti-human podoplanin mAbs, P2–0 and MS-1, interfere
with the binding of human podoplanin to CLEC-2,
recognizing the perimeter structure around Gly45, Asp48,
and Asp49 residues over PLAG2 and PLAG3 domains in
human podoplanin [22, 23] (Supplementary Figure S2A).
Because the Asp48 residue is an amino acid that is critical
for the recognition by anti-PLAG3 mAbs (Supplementary
Figure S2A) and its acidic side chain is suggested for
the binding to CLEC-2 [24], we expected that the highly
conserved Asp48 residue in the PLAG3 domain would
play an important role in the interaction with CLEC-2. In
fact, the substitution of Asp48 residue in PLAG3 to Ala
(D48A) reduced the CLEC-2 binding, and compared
with the D48A, the substitution of the Asp82 residue in
PLAG4 to Ala (D82A) partially but rather significantly
reduced the binding to CLEC-2 (Figure 2A and 2B).
Consistently with those Asp mutations, either mutation
of Glu47 or Thr52 in PLAG3, and Glu81 or Thr85 in
PLAG4 showed the reduction in the CLEC-2 binding
(Supplementary Figure S2B). Thus, those three, Glu,
Asp, and Thr are critical conserved residues for CLEC-2
binding in both PLAG domains. Importantly, the double
mutant harboring D48A and D82A mutations almost
completely lost the affinity to CLEC-2 (Figure 2B).
These results were consistent with the results obtained
using PLAG-deletion mutants (Figure 1C). Consistent
with CLEC-2-binding activities, single mutations at
Asp48 or Asp82 (D48A or D82A) also lowered the plateletaggregating ability when compared with WT podoplanin
(Figure 2C). Moreover, double mutant D48A/D82A could
no longer exhibit platelet-aggregating ability (Figure 2C).
These results indicate that PLAG4 plays a crucial role in
podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation via the formation
of a complex with CLEC-2.

concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4A). At higher
concentrations, PG4D1 and PG4D2 mAbs exerted stronger
inhibitory activities than our previously generated MS-1
mAb, which targets the PLAG2/PLAG3 domain [23].
Consistently, and similar to the MS-1 mAb, masking the
PLAG4 domain by PG4D1 and PG4D2 mAbs attenuated
CHO/PDPN binding to recombinant CLEC-2 (Figure 4B).
To exclude the possibility that anti-PLAG4 mAbs
showed the inhibition of podoplanin-CLEC-2 binding by
modulating the PLAG3-mediated binding to CLEC- 2,
we performed a competition assay again using the D48A/
PLAG3 point mutant (Supplementary Figure S3B).
PG4D1 and PG4D2 mAbs were able to neutralize
CHO/PDPN-D48A binding to recombinant CLEC-2 in
a dose-dependent manner and could almost completely
suppress binding at the highest mAb concentration
(100 µg/mL, Supplementary Figure S3B). To further
confirm that PLAG3 and PLAG4 domains are independently
associated with CLEC-2, we carried out competitive flow
cytometric analyses using fluorescent dye (DyLight594)labeled PG4D2 and MS-1 mAbs (Figure 4C). The reaction
of DyLight594-labeled MS-1 mAb to CHO/PDPN
was attenuated by the preincubation of the cells with
non-labeled MS-1 mAb but not by the non-labeled PG4D2
and vice versa (Figure 4C). These results indicated that
PG4D2 and MS-1 mAbs did not sterically hinder the
mutual targeting PLAG domain and that masking one
PLAG domain did not induce conformational changes
affecting CLEC-2 interaction through the other PLAG
domain. Therefore, PLAG3 and PLAG4 domains would
independently bind to CLEC-2.
We previously reported that podoplanin–CLEC-2
interaction was essential for podoplanin-induced platelet
aggregation and tumor metastasis [3, 6]. We therefore
examined the effect of anti-PLAG3 mAb MS-1 and
anti-PLAG4 mAbs PG4D1 and PG4D2 on podoplanininduced platelet aggregation. The incubation of mouse
platelets with CHO/PDPN cells induced platelet
aggregation, and the aggregation starting time was delayed
by adding MS-1, PG4D1, or PG4D2 mAb (Figure 5A).
The platelet aggregation induced by D48A/PLAG3mutated CHO/PDPN cells could be suppressed almost
completely by adding anti-PLAG4 mAb PG4D2 but
not by MS-1 mAb (Figure 5B). Similarly, the platelet
aggregation induced by D82A/PLAG4-mutated CHO/
PDPN cells could be almost completely suppressed by
adding anti-PLAG3 mAb MS-1 but not by PG4D2 mAb
(Supplementary Figure S4). These results demonstrated
that the PLAG4 domain possesses platelet aggregation
ability in addition to PLAG3 domain in human
podoplanin. We next performed an in vivo metastasis assay
to verify the role of the PLAG4 domain. Podoplanininduced pulmonary metastasis was significantly blocked
by a single administration of PG4D1 or PG4D2 mAb
on the day before tumor inoculation, like MS-1 mAb
(Figure 5C and 5D). These results indicate that the PLAG4
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

domain has a role in podoplanin-mediated metastasis
formation, and blocking the interaction between PLAG4–
CLEC-2 would be a promising strategy for suppressing
hematogenous metastasis.

DISCUSSION
We previously identified podoplanin/Aggrus/gp44
as a novel platelet aggregation-inducing factor and then
investigated the domain critical to its platelet aggregationinducing activity [6]; we discovered that the EDXXVTPG
motif is associated with its platelet-aggregating activity,
therefore designated the domain as the PLAG domain [6].
Almost all mammalian podoplanins contain three tandem
repeats of the PLAG domain at the extracellular domain
(PLAG1–3) [12]. Consistent with our previous finding that
O-glycanase treatment attenuated the platelet-aggregating
activity of podoplanin/gp44 [13], the Thr residue within
the PLAG domain was found to be O-glycosylated [25],
and the O-glycosylation is indispensable for exhibiting
its platelet-aggregating activity. This was evidenced by
the fact that substitution of Thr52 to Ala in the human
PLAG3 domain (47-EDDVVT52PG-54) attenuated the
activity and that podoplanin expressed in glycosylationdeficient CHO mutants, Lec-2 or Lec-8, exhibited
no platelet-aggregating activity [6, 14]. Moreover, a
synthetic podoplanin peptide containing human PLAG2
and PLAG3 domains exhibited platelet-aggregating
activity only after O-glycosylation at the Thr52 residue
[15]. A recent report on crystal structure revealed that
O-glycans attached to Thr52 in addition to Glu47 and Asp48
residues in the human PLAG3 domain are associated with
the binding to Arg residues in CLEC-2 [24]. Thus, the
minimum structure essential for the binding to CLEC2 appeared to be two negatively charged amino acids
following an O-glycosylated amino acid (i.e., EDXXXT).
In the case of our newly identified PLAG4 domain
(81-EDLPT85SE-87), Thr85 and Ser86 residues appeared
to be O-glycosylated since the NetOGlyc 4.0 Server
[26] predicted a higher possibility of O-glycosylation
at the Thr85 and Ser86 residues in the human PLAG4
domain than at the Thr52 residue in the human PLAG3
domain. Moreover, Zimmer et al. previously suggested
glycosylation at the Thr92 residue within the canine
PLAG4 domain (88-EDGPT92QE-94) [25]. Therefore,
O-glycosylated Thr85 and/or Ser86 in addition to negatively
charged Glu81 and Asp82 residues in the human PLAG4
domain would be associated with the binding to CLEC-2
and the platelet-aggregating activity of podoplanin.
Based on the low homology of the Ser86 residue among
mammalian podoplanin, O-glycans attached to the
Ser86 residue in the human PLAG4 domain may not be
required for CLEC-2 binding but may contribute to robust
PLAG4–CLEC-2 interaction. At least, we indicated the
contribution of Thr85 residue to CLEC-2 binding using its
Ala-substituted mutant (Supplementary Figure S2B). The

number of amino acids intervening between negatively
charged Glu–Asp residues and O-glycosylated Thr residue
is two in the PLAG4 domain and three in the PLAG1–3
domains (Figure 1E). Moreover, the EDXXT motif in the
PLAG4 domain is highly conserved among mammals
(36/42 species from multiple sequence alignment analysis;
Supplementary Figure S1), similar to the EDXXXT

motif in PLAG1 and PLAG3 (40/42 and 38/42 species,
respectively). Therefore, we find it appropriate to revise
the PLAG consensus sequence to ED(X)XXT, as shown in
Figure 1E.
The substitution of positively charged Arg residues
in CLEC-2 has been reported to suppress the binding
to podoplanin almost completely [24]. Although the

deletion of the PLAG3 or PLAG4 domain weakened
this interaction, the deletion of both PLAG3 and PLAG4
domains resulted in a complete loss of podoplanin–CLEC-2
interaction (Figure 1C). Furthermore we have confirmed
Glu81, Asp82, and Thr85 residues in the PLAG4 domain,
with the equivalent positions of Glu47, Asp48, and Thr52
residues in the PLAG3 domain, as essential for CLEC2 binding (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2B).
These results suggest that the human PLAG4 and PLAG3
domains share a binding site on CLEC-2. Because
podoplanin could coincidentally form a complex with
an antibody (150 kDa) larger than CLEC-2 (35 kDa),
(Figure 4C), it is possible that one molecule of podoplanin
could bind to two molecules of CLEC-2 at the same time.
This possibility is an advantage for Src and Syk signal
activation via a CLEC-2 dimer [27]. Two CLEC-2-binding
sites located on the podoplanin molecule may contribute
to CLEC-2 clustering and to fast signal transduction [28].
Although the monomer podoplanin-Fc protein alone
could not induce platelet aggregation, the addition of a
secondary antibody that enhanced CLEC-2 crosslinking
and oligomerization could trigger platelet aggregation
(data not shown). These results suggest that the
condensation of CLEC-2 in the cell–platelet adhesion area
would be essential for transmitting platelet-aggregating
signals via CLEC-2.
The actual role sharing between the PLAG3 and
PLAG4 domains in CLEC-2 binding remains unknown.
PLAG4 deletion or PLAG4 mutation resulted in a
drastic decrease in podoplanin–CLEC-2 binding when
compared with PLAG3 deletion or PLAG3 mutation
(Figure 1C and 2B). Moreover, the anti-PLAG4 mAbs
(PG4D1 and PG4D2) exerted stronger inhibitory
activity against podoplanin–CLEC-2 binding than did
the anti-PLAG3 mAb (MS-1) did (Figure 4A). These
results suggest the importance of the PLAG4 domain
in podoplanin–CLEC-2 binding. However, we could
not exclude the possibility that each cell uses the
PLAG3 and PLAG4 domains according to cell context
or microenvironment. In fact, the anti-PLAG3 mAb
preferentially recognized podoplanin expressed on
H226, PC-10, and KYSE70 cells, whereas anti-PLAG4
mAbs preferentially recognized podoplanin expressed on
UM-UC-5 and HT1080 cells (Supplementary Figure
S5). As no mutation was found in podoplanin expressed
in these cell lines, post-translational modifications, i.e.,
glycosylation, and interaction with other molecules, etc.
may affect the reactivity of the mAbs. These notions were
supported by a recent report that the anti-PLAG4 mAb
preferentially recognized metastasized osteosarcomas [29].
Our established anti-PLAG4 neutralizing mAbs,
PG4D1 and PG4D2, exhibited a high affinity to human
podoplanin with very low KD values (less than 0.3 nM).
The single administration of the anti-PLAG4 mAbs into
mice could almost completely suppress hematogenous

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metastasis of CHO/PDPN cells. Since a PG4D1 mAb
of murine IgG1 subclass exhibiting low ADCC/CDC
activity and a PG4D2 mAb of murine IgG2a subclass
having strong ADCC/CDC activity could suppress
pulmonary metastasis, ADCC/CDC activity would not
be associated with the metastasis-inhibitory function
of the mAbs, similarly to the anti-PLAG3 mAb MS-1
[23]. Considering the complete metastasis suppression
by only a single administration of anti-PLAG3 mAb
MS-1 (Figure 5C and 5D) [23], the transient suppression
of podoplanin–CLEC-2 binding would be sufficient to
suppress podoplanin-mediated hematogenous metastasis.
With regard to tumor suppression, ADCC/CDC activity
may be partly involved in the anti-tumor activity of the
anti-podoplanin antibodies because an anti-PLAG3 mAb
MS-1 of murine IgG2a subclass having strong ADCC/
CDC activity, but not an anti-PLAG3 mAb P2–0 of
murine IgG1 subclass exhibiting low ADCC/CDC activity,
could attenuate CHO/PDPN proliferation in nude mice
[23]. Of course, the inhibition of podoplanin–CLEC-2
binding would be sufficient to suppress the proliferation
of some tumors in vivo [23]. However, the interruption
of mAb administration resulted in recurrence of the
tumors [23]. These results indicate that either the use
of mAb possessing strong ADCC/CDC activity or the
complete inhibition of podoplanin–CLEC-2 binding by
the combined administration of anti-PLAG3 and antiPLAG4 mAbs may be required for inducing complete
tumor remission. As podoplanin is known to be expressed
in normal tissue, including lymphatic vessels, kidney
podocytes, mesothelium, and alveolar epithelium, the
complete blockade of podoplanin–CLEC-2 binding by the
co-administration of anti-PLAG3 and anti-PLAG4 mAbs
possessing no ADCC/CDC activity would be preferable as
anti-tumor agents with minimal side effects.
In this report, we succeeded in identifying the novel
PLAG4 domain that is associated with the binding to
CLEC-2 and platelet aggregation. Based on the PLAG4
domain sequence, we would propose ED(X)XXT as the
revised PLAG domain consensus sequence. Our finding
is expected to shed light on the clinical development of
podoplanin-targeting cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture conditions
CHO cells were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and
cultured in PRMI 1640 medium (Wako, Osaka, Japan)
containing 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).
Stable podoplanin-expressing clones were established
as described previously [6] and cultured in a medium
containing 250 μg/mL of G418 (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Plasmid construction

Flow cytometry

The pcDNA3 vector containing WT human podoplanin
cDNA (pcDNA3-podoplanin) was established as described
previously [6]. pcDNA3 vectors containing podoplanin
deletion mutated cDNAs (PDPN-∆29–34, PDPN-∆47–52,
PDPN-∆81–85, and PDPN-∆47–52/∆81–85) or podoplanin
point-mutated cDNAs (PDPN-G45A, PDPN-D48A, PDPND48N, PDPN-D48E, PDPN-D49A, PDPN-D82A, and PDPND48A/D82A) were generated from pcDNA3-podoplanin as
a template using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis
kit (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA). pGEX-6P-3
vectors (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) containing
signal peptide-deleted podoplanin cDNA (PDPN-∆N24)
or its point-mutated cDNAs were constructed as described
previously [22].

Cells were harvested and treated with 1 μg/ml of antipodoplanin antibodies or control mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA), following incubation with 4 μg/mL of
Alexa Flour 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For CLEC-2-binding
analysis, cells were incubated with 0.4 μg/mL of (His)10-tagged
human CLEC-2 protein (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA), following incubation with 1/500 dilutions of Alexa
Flour 488-conjugated anti-penta-His antibody (QIAGEN,
Venlo, Netherlands). Flow cytometric analyses were
performed using Cytomics FC500 flow cytometry system
(Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). In some experiments, MS-1
and PG4D2 mAbs were used as primary antibodies, following
the conjugation of DyLight594 using the DyLight antibody
labeling kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Animals

Platelet aggregation assay

Female BALB/c, BALB/c-nu/nu, and Jcl:ICR mice
were purchased from Charles River (Kanagawa, Japan).
All animal procedures were performed according to the
protocols approved by the Japanese Foundation for Cancer
Research Animal Care and Use Committee.

Murine whole blood was drawn by cardiac
puncture from Jcl:ICR mice terminally anesthetized with
sevoflurane and taken with heparin solution. Platelet-rich
plasma (PRP) was obtained from the supernatant of whole
blood by centrifugation at 120 xg for 8 min twice. Platelets
were collected from the pellets of PRP by centrifugation
at 500 xg for 10 min, and the supernatant was stocked
as platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Washed platelets were
prepared by washing the pellets with the modified Tyrode’s
buffer (137 mM NaCl, 11.9 mM NaHCO3, 0.4 mM
Na2HPO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.1 mM MgCl2, and 5.6 mM
glucose, pH 7.3) followed by centrifugation under the
same conditions and resuspended in the modified Tyrode’s
buffer at a concentration of 1 × 108/mL. Prior to the assay,
10% PPP and 400 μM CaCl2 were supplied to the washed
platelets. Next, the washed platelets were incubated with
cell suspension (1 × 108 cells/mL). For the antibody
inhibition assay, cells were incubated with 10 μg/mL of
mAb or control IgG for 30 min on ice before incubation
with platelets. The platelet aggregation rate was examined
using a platelet aggregometer (MCM HEMA TRACER
313M; SSR Engineering, Kanagawa, Japan).

Multiple sequence alignment and window analysis
All podoplanin protein sequences were obtained
from NCBI’s reference sequence database (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/). For the alignment of
podoplanin sequences, sequences including multiple
gaps were excluded, and typical experimental animal
species and representative species of each family were
selected. The selected 42 sequences are presented as
supplementary information (Supplementary Figure S1).
Sequences were aligned using the muscle alignment
algorithm available in the MEGA6 software [30].
Sliding-window analysis was performed using the AL2CO
program [31]. Hydropathy plots were generated using
Kyte and Doolittle amino acid hydropathy scores [32].

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in TENSV buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl
[pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1%
aprotinin, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and
electrophoresed followed by the transfer to a PDVF membrane
(Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). The GST-tagged
human PDPN-∆N24 and its point mutants were produced
in BL21 (DE3) E. coli (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), and the cell pellets were boiled in SDS sample
buffer for immunoblots. The membranes were incubated with
antibodies to podoplanin (D2–40, AbD Serotec, Oxford,
UK; FL-162, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA; MS-1; P2–0; PG4D1; and PG4D2), α-tubulin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and GST (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK).

Hybridoma production and antibody purification
A human podoplanin cDNA region encoding amino
acids 76–89 (226–267 bp) was cloned and tandemly
connected 12 and 40 times. These cDNA fragments
were inserted into a pGEX-6P-3 vector (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK). Next, the GST-tagged human
podoplanin peptide (76–89 aa) produced in BL21 (DE3)
E. coli was purified using glutathione sepharose.
Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected with
the GST-tagged peptide as an immunogen in conjugation
with Titer MAX Gold adjuvant (Titer MAX, Norcross,
GA, USA). Further, intraperitoneal immunization was
performed intermittently for two months. Mice were

euthanized, and splenocytes were fused with mouse
myeloma P3U1 cells using PEG4000 (Merck, Whitehouse
Station, NJ, USA). Hybridoma screening and antibody
purification from ascites were performed as described
previously [22]. IgG isotypes were identified using the
Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Isotyping Test Kit (AbD
Serotec, Oxford, UK).

This study was performed as a research program
of the Project for Development of Innovative Research
on Cancer Therapeutics (P-DIRECT, No. 14056017),
Japan Agency for Medical Research and development
(AMED), and was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid
for Challenging Exploratory Research from JSPS,
Japan (Grant No. 26640108; to N.F.), by SRF (to N.F.),
and by the Princess Takamatsu Cancer Research Fund
(Grant No. 13–24519; to N.F.).

SPR analysis
SPR analysis was performed using Biacore X100
(GE healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Recombinant
human podoplanin-Fc protein (R & D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) was immobilized on a CM5
sensor chip (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).
Final levels of immobilization were approximately
562.2 or 562.6 response units (measure conditions of
PG4D1 or PG4D2, respectively). Five concentrations
of PG4D1, PG4D2 mAbs, and their control mouse IgGs
were flowed over the chip in the single cycle kinetics.
Sensorgrams were fit by global analysis using the Biacore
X100 evaluation software. Efforts toward determining the
equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) were decided using
the bivalent binding analyte model.
