ABSTRACT
Although the new generation of androgen receptor (AR) antagonists like
enzalutamide (ENZ) prolong survival of metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC), AR-driven tumors eventually recur indicating that additional therapies
are required to fully block AR function. Since DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) was
demonstrated to be essential for AR to initiate gene transcription, this study tested
whether catalytic inhibitors of Topo II can block AR signaling and suppress ENZresistant CRPC growth. Using multiple prostate cancer cell lines, we showed that
catalytic Topo II inhibitors, ICRF187 and ICRF193 inhibited transcription activities
of the wild-type AR, mutant ARs (F876L and W741C) and the AR-V7 splice variant.
ICRF187 and ICRF193 decreased AR recruitment to target promoters and reduced AR
nuclear localization. Both ICRF187 and ICRF193 also inhibited cell proliferation and
delayed cell cycling at the G2/M phase. ICRF187 inhibited tumor growth of castrationresistant LNCaP and 22RV1 xenografts as well as ENZ-resistant MR49F xenografts.
We conclude that catalytic Topo II inhibitors can block AR signaling and inhibit tumor
growth of CRPC xenografts, identifying a potential co-targeting approach using these
inhibitors in combination with AR pathway inhibitors in CRPC.

INTRODUCTION

required to thoroughly suppress AR signaling in patients
with CRPC. Genome-wide profiling studies demonstrated
that the AR regulated transcriptome in CRPC is
significantly different from that in ADT-naïve prostate
cancers [6]. AR activated genes in CRPC were dominated
by cell cycle and mitosis genes such as UBE2C, CDC20
and CDK1 [6, 7]. These results suggest that targeting cell
mitosis controlled by the AR signaling in CRPC may
inhibit tumor growth and progression more effectively.
The transcriptional activity of AR requires DNA
Topoisomerase II (Topo II) to be recruited to target
promoters [8-10]. Topo II creates transient, but fixable
DNA double strand breaks to relax the topology of
DNA, which are required for AR to mediate transcription
initiation [9, 10]. Blocking Topo II expression or
function impairs AR transcriptional activity and ARdriven cell proliferation [8]. Additionally, Topo II was
also demonstrated to be responsible for gene fusion of
TMPRSS2-ERG, one of the most common genomic
alterations in prostate cancer [8, 10]. Increased expression
of Topo II is associated with higher Gleason score and

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the first line
of treatment for locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic
prostate cancers. It aims at suppressing transcriptional
activity of the androgen receptor (AR). Despite frequent
and often durable responses, progression to castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC) invariably occurs,
most often driven by reactivation on the AR pathway via
mechanisms involving AR amplification, overexpression,
mutations as well as intratumoral steroidogenesis [1-3].
These observations indicate that cellular resistance to ADT
is not necessarily a result of the acquisition of growth
independence from androgens, as was previously believed,
but rather reflect cellular acquisition of mechanisms to
overcome castrate-levels of androgens. Recently, more
potent androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors like
abiraterone and enzalutamide (ENZ) improved survival in
metastatic CRPC [4, 5]. However, resistance emerges even
with the most potent AR pathway inhibitors [4, 5]. These
observations emphasize that alternative approaches are

relative ADT insensitivity of prostate tumors [11]. These
findings suggest that inhibition of both Topo II and AR
may cooperatively de-activate AR signaling and delay
CRPC progression.
There are two types of Topo II inhibitors, Topo
II poisons and catalytic inhibitors. Topo II poisons are
exemplified by the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic, etoposide.
When DNA breaks are created by Topo II, etoposide
inhibits Topo II to re-ligate DNA breaks resulting in DNA
damage. Such unfixable DNA damages cause cell cycle
arrest and subsequently apoptosis [12-14]. Catalytic Topo
II inhibitors are exemplified by ICRF187 and ICRF193,
which target the catalytic domain of Topo II and prevent
formation of DNA double strand breaks, resulting in
unrelaxed DNA conformation [15]. Additionally, ICRF193
was reported to induce cell cycle arrest by inhibiting
chromosome condensation and segregation at the M phase
of cell cycle, as Topo II is required to de-catenate the
intertwined chromosomes [16]. Unlike Topo II poisons,
catalytic inhibitors block Topo II activity without creating
DNA breaks, and hence exhibit minimal cytotoxic effects.
Together, these findings led us to hypothesize that catalytic
Topo II inhibitors may block AR signaling and induce
G2/M cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells.
In this study, we demonstrate that catalytic Topo
II inhibitors can block AR signaling and inhibit prostate
cancer cell proliferation and CRPC growth, provide proofof-principle that co-targeting Topo II in combination with
AR pathway inhibitors may cooperatively de-activate the
AR and delay CRPC progression.

AR signaling by measuring AR targeted transcription of
PSA, TMPRSS2 and FKBP5 genes (Figure 1d and S2a).
Although LNCaP and LNCaP95 cells responded to 1nM
of R1881 by upregulating PSA, TMPRSS2 and FKBP5
expression, both ICRF187 and ICRF193 caused 3060% deduction in mRNA levels of these genes. Similar
results were also obtained in VCaP cells (Figure S2b).
Moreover, ICRF187 and ICRF193 further inhibited PSA
mRNA levels when LNCaP cell were under 5uM of ENZ
(Figure 1d and S2). Importantly, ICRF187 and ICRF193
suppressed PSA mRNA levels by 40-50% in ENZ-resistant
MR49F cells (Figure 1d).

ICRF187 and ICRF193 block transcriptional
activity of AR, AR mutants, and AR-V7 in
prostate cancer cells
We next tested the effect of catalytic Topo II
inhibitors on the transcriptional activity of mutant AR
and the AR-V7 splice variant. The AR carrying the
F876L mutation can be transcriptionally activated by
ENZ, while the W741C mutation can activate the AR by
bicalutamide [19, 20]. In AR negative 293T cells, PSAluciferase reporter activities driven by AR(F876L) or
AR(F876L/T877A) in the presence of 10uM of ENZ were
significantly suppressed by ICRF187 or ICRF193 (Figure
2a). Similarly, ICRF187 and ICRF193 also inhibited the
luciferase activity driven by AR(W741C) in the presence
of bicalutamide. Additionally, luciferase activity driven
by AR-V7 was also strongly repressed by ICRF187 and
ICRF193 dose-dependently in AR negative PC3 cells
(Figure 2b). When LNCaP cells were transfected with the
PSA-luciferase reporter and treated with 1nM of R1881
plus 0.01-10uM of ENZ, ICRF187 or ICRF193, we
observed that ENZ potently suppressed the transcriptional
activity of AR-FL. ICRF87 and ICRF193 also showed
dose-dependent inhibition of luciferase activity but to
milder extents (Figure 2c). However, when LNCaP cells
were co-treated with 5uM of ENZ plus 0.01-10uM of
either ICRF187 or ICRF193, a further 20% deduction in
luciferase activity was observed. These results suggest
that Topo II inhibitors can increase the efficacy of ENZ
in blocking the AR function. In ENZ-resistant MR49F,
ICRF187 and ICRF193 resulted in 40% and 60% decrease
in luciferase activity respectively (Figure 2d). LNCaP95
cells express not only full length AR, but also AR splice
variants including AR-V7 and ARv567ed. Co-treatment
of ICRF187 or ICRF193 with 5uM of ENZ induced a
further 60% decrease in luciferase activity driven by
the AR splice variants in LNCaP95 cells (Figure 2d).
Interestingly, several other catalytic inhibitors of Topo II
including Merbarone, Aclacinomycin A and Genistein all
showed suppressive impacts to AR signaling in prostate
cancer cells (Figure S3). By contrast, the Topo II poison,
etoposide, increased AR transactivation dose-dependently.

RESULTS
Topo II is required for the transcriptional activity
of the AR
Two Topo II isoforms, alpha and beta, are widely
expressed in prostate cancer cells [17]. We confirmed that
Topo II beta was highly expressed in our collection of
human prostate cancer cell lines (Figure 1a). Androgenindependent LNCaP(AI) and LNCaP95 cell lines as
well as ENZ-resistant MR49F cell line expressed higher
levels of Topo II beta than their parental LNCaP cells.
Androgen treatment did not significantly alter Topo II
beta expression. In LNCaP cells, Topo II beta silencing
dramatically reduced mRNA levels of AR regulated
genes including PSA and TMPRSS2 (Figure 1b-c). These
results were also confirmed in MR49F and LNCaP95
cells (Figure 1c). Reduced mRNA expression of PSA and
TMPRSS2 by Topo II silencing was not due to reduced
AR protein levels in these cells (Figure 1b).
ICRF187 and ICRF193 are catalytic inhibitors to
both Topo II isoforms [18]. We treated prostate cancer
cells with these inhibitors to determine their impacts on

AR recruitment. These changes were not due to decreased
AR protein levels within the 2 hour treatment. However,
co-treatment of ICRF187 or ICRF193 with ENZ for 24
hours resulted in greater deduction in AR protein levels
when compared with ENZ treatment alone. LNCaP cells
expressing GFP-AR were next used to study the effects
of ENZ and Topo II inhibitors on subcellular localization
of AR-FL. As expected, R1881 induced, while 10uM of
ENZ blocked nuclear localization of AR-FL (Figure 3b).
Nuclear localization of AR-FL was reduced by 1uM of
ICRF187 or ICRF193, comparable with that of ENZ. In
addition, we also study subcellular localizations of AR
mutants and AR-V7 under catalytic Topo II inhibitor

was robustly recruited to the androgen responsive
elements in PSA and TMPRSS2 promoters. However,

cells were transfected with plasmids of wild type AR,
AR(F876L), AR(W741C) or AR-V7 and then treated
with vehicle, ICRF187, or ICRF193 in the presence of
10nM of R1881, 10uM of ENZ or 10uM of bicalutamide.
ICRF187 and ICRF193 reduced protein levels of wild
type AR, AR(F876L), AR(W741C) in the nuclear extracts,
but increased their protein levels in cytosol fractions.
However, AR-V7 protein was primarily localized in
nuclear fraction. Together, these results suggest that Topo
II catalytic inhibitors supress AR recruitment to its target
promoters and reduce AR protein nuclear localization.

MTS assays were used to study the effects of
catalytic Topo II inhibitors on prostate cancer cell growth.
Parental LNCaP cell growth was similarly inhibited by
ENZ, ICRF187 or ICRF193 under androgen deprived
conditions (Figure 4a). By contrast, ICRF187 and
ICRF193 but not ENZ suppressed LNCaP95, MR49F
cell and 22RV1 cell growth rates. Additionally, neither
ENZ nor ICRF187/ICRF193 had suppressive impacts on
cell proliferation of AR negative PC3 and DU145 cells.

ICRF187 and ICRF193 on cell cycling of prostate cancer
cells. The cell cycling of LNCaP and LNCaP95 cells were

and then released by adding medium containing 10%
serum. We observed that neither ICRF187 nor ICRF193
altered cell population distributions during cell cycling
(Figure 4b). However when cell cycle was synchronized
at the G2/M phases by nocodazole and then released,
ICRF187 and ICRF193 caused significant delays for the
cells passing through the G2/M and entering into the G1
phase (Figure 4c). These results indicate that ICRF187
and ICRF193 inhibited cancer cell proliferation through
impeding cell cycling.

The inhibitory effects of ICRF187 were tested
in four CRPC xenograft models. After 8 weeks of
treatment of CRPC LNCaP tumors, 10mg/kg daily of

reduction by 50mg/kg daily of ICRF187 (Figure 5a).
However, combinational treatment using lower doses of
ENZ (5mg/kg) and ICRF187 (25mg/kg) reduced tumor
volume by 64%. Similar changes in serum PSA levels
were also observed. The expression of AR targeted

androgen synthesis or antagonizing the ligand binding
domain (LBD) of the AR. However, these drugs induce
resistance via adaptive changes in the AR genome
including AR amplification, mutations and constitutively
active AR splice variants [19-21]. For example, ENZ
and ARN-509 promote accumulation of the F876L point
mutation in the AR which converts antagonist to agonist
function and confers anti-AR resistance [19, 20]. These
studies highlight that targeting the LBD of AR will have
limited success due to activation of adaptive survival
pathways that compromise the effectiveness of AR
blockade. Our studies here present an alternative strategy,
whereby targeting AR-mediated gene transcription
initiation may enhance castration therapy regardless of
the transactivation status of AR, AR mutants or AR splice
variants (Figure 6). Using the ENZ-resistant MR49F and
androgen-independent LNCaP95 cells models, we show
that ICRF187 and ICRF913 potently inhibit AR signaling
(Figures 1-3), cancer cell proliferation (Figure 4) and
CRPC xenograft growth (Figure 5). Catalytic Topo II
inhibitors may therefore represent a novel class of nonLBD inhibitors of AR signaling beneficial for CRPC
patients.
In contrast to AR pathway inhibitors, catalytic Topo
II inhibitors target not only AR-mediated transcription
initiation but also suppress cancer cell mitosis. Since
a downstream effector of re-activated AR signalling in
CRPC tumors is acceleration of tumor cell mitosis [6, 7],
targeting both cancer cell cycling and AR transcriptional

DISCUSSION
Although it is well established that AR-mediated
transcription initiation requires Topo II to create DNA
double strand breaks at the target promoters, this
fundamental knowledge has not yet been translated into
effective therapies to inhibit AR signaling in CRPC
patients. Our study indicates that catalytic Topo II
inhibitors can block both the transcriptional activity of
AR and prostate cancer cell mitosis. While re-activation
of AR signaling and mitosis of cancer cells are two
major features of CRPC, our study identifies catalytic
Topo II inhibitors as a potential co-targeting approach in
combination with AR pathway inhibitors in CRPC.
ADT and newer AR pathway inhibitors such
as abiraterone and ENZ aim to retain the AR in its
transcriptionally inactive state, by either inhibiting

activity may more strongly inhibit CRPC growth. In
support of this hypothesis, inhibitors to cyclin-dependent
kinases are effective in delaying ENZ-resistance cancer
cell growth[20]. Our results further indicated that cotreatment of Topo II inhibitors with ENZ results in
stronger suppression to AR signaling (Figures 1-3) and
CRPC cell growth and tumor growth (Figure 4-5).
The knowledge that Topo II is required for
AR transcriptional activity may lead to two possible
therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer patients.
One possibility is to utilize super physiological doses
of androgen in combination with Topo II poisons, as
proposed previously [22], to capitalize on androgenactivated AR and AR-recruited Topo II to target
promoters. However, due to the presence of Topo II
poisons, AR-induced DNA double strand breaks cannot
be fixed thereby leading to G2/M cell cycle arrest followed
by apoptotic cell death. The potential risk would be that
surviving cells could accumulate complex genomic
rearrangement, adaptive DNA repair systems and greater
heterogeneity. Additionally, AR transcriptional activity
is enhanced by Topo II poisons (Figure S3). The other
possible therapeutic strategy is applying AR pathway
inhibitors with catalytic Topo II inhibitors to repress AR
activation and AR-mediated transcription initiation. Since
catalytic topo II inhibitors prevent DNA double strand
breaks, they also cause cell cycle delay at the G2/M phases
by interfering chromosome condensation and segregation
during mitosis, and have lower chance to induce further
genomic rearrangement.
In summary, we demonstrate that catalytic Topo
II inhibitors can block AR signaling and inhibit tumor
growth of castration-resistant xenografts, identifying
catalytic Topo II inhibitors as potentially novel drugs to
treat in patients with CRPC.

Real-time PCR & immunoblotting
Real-time PCR assays were performed as described

mini kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was conducted in
triplicates using Applied Biosystems7900HT with 5ng of
cDNA, 1uM of each primer pair and SYBR green PCR
master mix (Roche). All real-time PCR assays were carried
out using three technical replicates and three independent
cDNA syntheses. Western blotting assays were performed
as we reported [28]. Experiments were repeated in three
independent experiments and one representative blots
were shown. Information on primers and antibodies were
listed in Supplementary Table.

Transfection and luciferase reporter assay
Plasmid DNA were transfected into cells using
Lipofectmine 2000 (Invitrogen), while siRNA was
transfected by siLentFect reagent (Bio-Rad). Luciferase
activities were determined using the luciferin reagent
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Transfection efficiency was normalized to Renilla
luciferase activities.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and
fluorescence microscopy
ChIP assays were performed with AR antibody
(Santa Cruz) as we described[23]. To determine AR
subcellular localization, LNCaP cells stably expressing
GFP-tagged AR were used. Cells were counterstained
by DAPI and images were captured by using a Zeiss
LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Instruments)
as we reported [28]. AR subcellular localization was also
confirmed by Western blotting nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts from cells transfected with Flag-tagged AR, AR
mutants and the AR-V7 splice variant.

Detail statistical analyses were addressed in each figure
legend.

Cell cycling was analyzed by FACS with 40ug/
mL propidium iodide staining following the protocol
(http://www.meduniwien.ac.at/user/johannes.schmid/
PIstaining3.htm.) Relative DNA contents from 10,000
cells were analyzed by FACSCanto II flow cytometer and
BD FACSDiva software v5.0.3 (Becton Dickinson) as we
reported [28].

Human prostate cancer xenografts

Authors have nothing to disclose.

To construct CRPC LNCaP xenografts, a total
of 1×106 LNCaP cells in 0.1mL Matrigel (Becton
Dickinson Labware) were inoculated subcutaneously
in bilateral flanks of 6-8 week old male athymic nude
mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc.). Tumor volume
(V= L*W*D*0.5236) and body weight were measured
weekly. Serum PSA levels were determined by ELISA.
When serum PSA concentrations reached 50ng/mL, mice
were castrated. CRPC LNCaP tumors were defined when
PSA levels relapsed to pre-castrated levels. Animals were
randomly separated into four groups treated daily with
control, 10mg/kg ENZ, 50mg/kg ICRF187 or 5mg/kg
ENZ plus 25mg/kg ICRF187. To establish ENZ-resistant
MR49F xenografts, castrated mice were inoculated
subcutaneously with MR49F cells and treated with 10mg/
kg ENZ daily till endpoint. When tumor volumes reached
100mm3, mice were also treated daily with vehicle, 25mg/
kg or 50mg/kg of ICRF187. Tumor volumes and PSA
levels were measured. CRPC 22RV1 xenografts were
constructed by inoculating 22RV1 cells subcutaneously
in bilateral flanks of nude mice. When mice were castrated
and tumors reached to 100mm3, mice were treated daily
with vehicle or 50mg/kg ICRF187. PC3 xenografts were
constructed by inoculating PC3 cells subcutaneously in
male athymic nude mice. When tumors reached 200mm3,
mice were treated daily with vehicle or 50mg/kg ICRF187.
In all experiments, animals will be sacrificed if tumors
mass is ~10% of the body weight or any endpoint situation
according to the animal protocol. At the endpoint, tumors
were harvested for evaluations of mRNA levels of AR
targeted genes by real-time PCR. Tumors samples were
also used to construct tissue microarray to measure Ki67
expressions by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All animal
procedures were under the guidelines of the Canadian
Council on Animal Care.
