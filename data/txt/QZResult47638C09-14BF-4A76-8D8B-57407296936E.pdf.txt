BACKGROUND. Constitutive activation of nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB) is a frequent
molecular alteration in pancreatic cancer and a number of studies have suggested that constitutive NF-jB activity plays a key role in the aggressive behavior
of this disease. In an attempt to identify an effective therapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer, the authors studied the role of FUT-175, a synthetic serine protease inhibitor, in the inhibition of NF-jB activation and the induction of apoptotic
responses.

METHODS. To examine the effect of FUT-175 on the inhibition of NF-jB and the
induction of apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines, Western and Northern blot
analyses, electromobility shift (EMSA), luciferase reporter gene, DNA fragmentation, immunoprecipitation, in vitro kinase, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed.

RESULTS. In a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner, FUT-175 inhibited
IjBa phosphorylation and NF-jB activation, thereby inhibiting the antiapoptotic
activity of NF-jB. Simultaneously, FUT-175 up-regulated the expression of tumor

unique function as a NF-jB inhibitor and apoptosis inducer, this well-established
synthetic serine protease inhibitor with as-of-yet poorly understood mechanisms

phosphorylated by the IjB kinase complex (IKK), rapidly polyubiquitinated, and then degraded by the 26S
proteosome.3,4 Consequently, NF-jB proteins are
released for nuclear translocation, in which they activate the expression of target genes such as its own inhibitor, IjBa.2 Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1
(TNFR1)-induced apoptosis proceeds through rapid
recruitment of TRADD, RIP1, and the TRAF2 complex
and the subsequent recruitment of the adaptor Fasassociated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8/10.5
If NF-jB is activated by the TNFR1 complex, levels of
FLIPL, a NF-jB–regulated gene, are sufficiently
increased to inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival.5 The loss of regulation of NF-jB activity is
involved in many inflammatory diseases and malignancies.6
Constitutive activation of nuclear factor-jB (NFjB) is a frequent molecular alteration in pancreatic
cancer. Several studies have shown that the autocrine
stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines induce constitutive NF-jB activity in human pancreatic cancer
cell lines.7,8 Inhibition of constitutive NF-jB activity
by a mutant IjBa (S32, 36A) completely suppresses
the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of pancreatic and other cancer cell lines, suggesting that constitutive RelA/NF-jB activity plays a key role in cancer
metastasis and tumor progression.9,10
FUT-175, a well-established synthetic serine protease inhibitor, has been shown to be an effective
therapeutic agent for disseminated intravascular
coagulation, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and pancreatitis.11–13 FUT-175 is a potent inhibitor of neutrophils, the complement system, the
coagulation system, and the activity of many proteases such as trypsin and plasmin.14 For example,
the invasive ability of a pancreatic cancer cell line
(PANC-1) transfected with a trypsinogen was suppressed by FUT-175 (10 lM) to the level observed in
parental cells.15 The anti-inflammatory effect of
FUT-175 led us to examine whether it may inhibit
constitutive NF-jB activation thereby potentiating
the proapoptotic effects of other chemotherapeutic
agents in pancreatic cancer cells. Current therapy
for pancreatic cancer is not effective and this disease is the fourth leading cause of cancer death,
with a 5–year survival rate of 1–3%.16,17 New
approaches to therapy are desperately needed. We
found that FUT-175 inhibited NF-jB activation by
suppressing IKK-mediated IjBa phosphorylation
and simultaneously induced TNFR1-mediated caspase-8 activation. Both of these effects resulted in
apoptosis. Our findings suggest that the dual proapoptotic function of FUT-175 may render it a potentially valuable therapy for pancreatic cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Cultures
The human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines
MDAPanc-28,18 and AsPc-1, PANC-1, and Capan-1
(ATCC, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin in
an incubator at 378 C with 5% carbon dioxide.
Reagents and Antibodies
6-amidino-2-naphthyl-4-guanidinobenzoate dimethanesulfonate (nafamostat mesylate, FUT-175, Futhan)
was obtained from Torii Pharmaceutical (Tokyo,
Japan) and was stored in a stock solution (5 mg/mL)
of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 208C. TNF-a
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was stored in a
stock solution (10 ng/lL) of PBS containing 120 nM of
bovine serum albumin at 208C. Mouse monoclonal
anti-IjBa (H-4), mouse monoclonal anticaspase 8 p20
(D-8), mouse monoclonal anti-TNFR1 (H-5), mouse
monoclonal anti-FLIP S/L (G-11), goat polyclonal
antiphospho-FADD (Ser 194) (p-FADD), anti-PEA3,
and antigoat antibodies were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody was obtained from Sigma
Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO). Rabbit polyclonal
antiphospho-IjBa (p-IjBa) antibody was obtained
from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-jBid antibody
was generously provided by Dr. Xiongwei Wu (Baylor
College of Medicine, Houston, TX).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was
performed as using nuclear extracts as previously
described.9 We used the jB probe (50 -CTCAACAGAGGGG ACTTTCCGAGAGGCCAT-30 ) with the jB site
underlined. Oct-1 probe (50 -TGTCGAAT GCAAATCACTAGAA-30 ) was used as a loading control. A competitive binding experiment was performed with a 50-fold
excess of wild-type or mutant jB oligonucleotides (50 CTCAACAG AGTTGACTTTTCGAGAGGCCAT-30 ).
Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays
Transient transfection and luciferase assays were performed.9 Briefly, firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of the Renilla luciferase, which
served as an internal control. The experiments were
performed in triplicate and repeated twice.
Western Blot Analysis
Immunoblotting was performed as described.9 Briefly,
soluble protein was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Osmonics, Westborough, MA). The membrane

was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing
0.2% Tween 20 (Fisher Scientific; Fairlawn, NJ) and
incubated with primary antibodies. The membrane
was washed and probed with horseradish peroxidasecoupled secondary goat antimouse immunoglobulin
G antibody (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). The
protein was detected with Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Northern Blot Analysis
Briefly, total RNA (25 lg) was denatured, fractionated
by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel containing
formaldehyde, transferred to a Magnacharge nylon
transfer membrane (Osmonics Inc., Minnetonka,
MN), and exposed to ultraviolet light for crosslinking.
32
P-labeled cDNA probe was produced by random
cDNA labeling method. Blots were hybridized,
exposed, stripped, and rehybridized with the cDNA
probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH).
MTT Assay
The standard thiazolyl blue (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; MTT) cell proliferation assay was performed as described
previously.19 The experiments were performed in
triplicate.
DNA Fragmentation Assay
Briefly, the level of DNA fragmentation in apoptotic
cells was determined by gel electrophoresis.19 The
cells were washed with PBS and incubated with DNA
fragment isolation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA], and 0.5%
Triton X-100) for 30 minutes on ice. The low molecular weight DNA fragments were extracted from the supernatant fluid with phenol/chloroform, precipitated
with an equal volume of 2-propanol, and analyzed by
separation on a 1.5% agarose gel.
Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay
Immunoprecipitation and IjBa kinase IKK assay were
performed.20 Briefly, the kinase reaction was performed for 30 minutes at 378C in 30 lL of kinase
buffer containing 5 lCi of [g-32P] ATP and 10 ng of
glutathione S- transferase (GST)-IjBa (1-54aa) as substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of
SDS gel sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and
detected by autoradiography.
Small Interfering RNA Transfection
Inhibition of TNFR1 was performed using small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes and siRNA sequences
previously designed and described.20 TNFR1 siRNA

(50 -UGUCGAGCUGCAUCAGUAGdTdT-30
and
50 0
GAGCCUAGACAGUGCGUUUdTdT-3 ) was obtained
from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). MDAPanc-28 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected at 40% confluence with siRNA duplexes (20
nM) using TransIT-TKO from Mirus (Madison, WI)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was
performed with an assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology,
Lake Placid, NY). Two polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) primers, 50 -AGATCTGGGACTCCTGTGCT-30 and
50 -CAGGAAGAGCTGGA GGAGGA-30 , were used to
amplify a 100-base pair (bp) fragment that corresponded to the predicted PEA3 transcription factor
binding site in the TNFR1 promoter.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and the percentage of
apoptotic cancer cells from the assay was compared
using the Student t test. A P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
FUT-175 Inhibits NF-jB Activity by Blocking
IjBa Phosphorylation
Previous studies have demonstrated that FUT-175
strongly inhibited activation of trypsinogen and neutrophil at a concentration of 150 lM measured in the
serum of patients treated with FUT-175 for pancreatitis and other inflammatory diseases.14 To determine
whether the anti-inflammatory activity of FUT-175
has any inhibitory effects on NF-jB signaling, we analyzed NF-jB DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts
and of IjBa protein levels in cytoplasmic extracts
from MDAPanc-28 cells treated with FUT-175 for various times (3–48 hours) and at various concentrations
(5– 80 lg/mL [10– 150 lM]). FUT-175 inhibited NF-jB
DNA-binding activity and the degradation of IjBa in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A and 1B) as well as in
a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C and 1D). Western
blot analysis using an antiphospho-IjBa specific antibody revealed that phosphorylation of IjBa was
inhibited by FUT-175 in a time-dependent manner
(Fig. 1E). Furthermore, anti-p65/NF-jB immunoblot
analysis demonstrated that nuclear localization of
p65/NF-jB is greatly reduced by using the nuclear
fractions of FUT-175-treated cells (Fig. 1F). The quality of the nuclear protein extracts was determined by
immunoblotting and the results demonstrated the absence of paxillin, a cytoplasmic protein, in the nuclear

protein extracts (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these results
demonstrated that the constitutive NF-jB in MDACPanc-28 cells was inhibited by FUT-175 in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner, which was
consistent with the finding by Noguchi et al. that
FUT-175 suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
NF-jB activation in macrophage.21
In Figure 2A, the EMSA supershift showed that
p65/NF-jB was present as a component in the constitutive NF-jB activity, which confirmed our previous
reports.22 The inhibitory effect of FUT-175 on NF-jB
activity was also found in AsPc-1, but much less effect
on inhibition of NF-jB activity was detected in
Capan-1 pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 2B). As shown in
Figure 2C, the inhibitory effect of FUT-175 on NF-jB
activity was very similar to NF-jB inhibitor PS1145
and PS-341.
To determine how NF-jB was inhibited by FUT175, an in vitro kinase assay was performed. We found
that phosphorylation of IjBa from the cytoplasmic
extracts of FUT-175-treated cells and phosphorylation
of GST-IjBa (1-54 aa) by immunoprecipitated-IKK
were inhibited within 24 hours in FUT-175-treated
cells (Fig. 2D and E). Taken together, these results suggest that FUT-175 inhibits NF-jB activation by blocking phosphorylation of IjBa, unlike proteasome
inhibitors such as MG231 and PS341 that block protein degradation.

FUT-175 Is a Potent Inducer of Apoptosis
To determine whether inhibition of NF-jB sensitized
pancreatic cancer cells to apoptosis, the effect of FUT175 on pancreatic cancer cell viability was determined
with and without treatment with TNF-a. The results
showed that FUT-175 substantially reduced the cell
viability of MDAPanc-28 cells at both 24 hours and

(B) Cells were treated with FUT175 at various concentrations as indicated for 48 hours, and the genomic DNA was subjected to DNA fragmentation assay. (C) Cells were treated with FUT-175

AsPc-1, Panc-1, and Capan-1 were treated with FUT-175 (80 lg/mL) for 48 hours and subjected to MTT assay to determine cell viability.

48 hours and that combined treatment with FUT-175
(80 lg/mL) and TNF-a (5 ng/mL) did not significantly
enhance this effect (Fig. 3A). To determine whether
the reduced cell viability was due to apoptosis, a DNA
fragmentation assay was performed using various
concentrations of FUT-175 and TNF-a. The results
showed that FUT-175 induced apoptosis at concentrations 40 lg/mL (Fig. 3B). When FUT-175 (40 or 80
lg/mL) and TNF-a (5 or 50 ng/mL) were combined,
apoptosis was found to be enhanced (Fig. 3C). To confirm this finding, the cell cycle profiles of FUT-175treated and FUT-175 untreated cells were analyzed by
propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry
approach (Fig. 3D). The results showed that FUT-175

increased the subG1 cell population. Furthermore,
FUT-175 reduced the cell viability of the MDAPanc28, AsPc-1, Panc-1, and Capan-1 pancreatic cancer
cell lines (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results suggest that FUT-175 alone is sufficient to activate proapoptotic signaling pathways and this effect is only
modestly enhanced by TNF-a.

FUT-175 Up-regulates the Expression
of TNFR1 to Induce Apoptosis
Previous studies have demonstrated that TNFR1mediated signal transduction apoptosis involves a
checkpoint and induces cell death when NF-jB fails
to be activated.5 To determine whether FUT-175-

induced apoptosis involves activation of TNFR1 signaling, we examined the effect of FUT-175 on TNFR1
expression using Western blot and Northern blot analyses. The results showed that FUT-175 up-regulated
both protein and mRNA TNFR1 levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A and 4B). To determine
whether an elevated expression level of TNFR1
initiates apoptotic signaling cascades, we examined
caspase-8 activation. FUT-175 activated caspase-8
and the activation of caspase 8 was found to be timedependent (Fig. 4C and 4D). Because caspase-8 activation depends on FADD, signal-dependent phosphorylation of FADD was examined using Western blot
analysis, which showed time-dependent phosphorylation of FADD on Ser-194 in FUT-175-stimulated cells
(Fig. 4E). The expression of FLICE/capase-8-inhibitory
protein (FLIP), which is induced by NF-jB to inhibit
caspase-8 activation by competing with caspase-8 for
the death-inducing signaling complex binding,5 was
not detected (data not shown). Finally, to evaluate the
effect of FUT-175 on the initiation of proapoptotic signaling pathways in TNF1-mediated caspase-8 activation, the generation of the Bid cleavage product, jBid,
which is essential to relieve the inhibition imposed by
TRAF2-cIAP1 on caspase-8 activation and hence the
induction of apoptosis,23 was investigated. Western
blot analysis demonstrated that jBid was induced in a
time-dependent manner (Fig. 4F). Taken together,
these results suggest that FUT-175 activates proapoptotic signaling pathways by inducingTNFR1 expression and inhibiting NF-jB activation.
To determine whether FUT-175-mediated caspase-8 activation is dependent on TNFR1 and
whether FUT-175-mediated up-regulation of TNFR1
resulted in caspase-8 activation and initiated proapoptotic signaling in the absence of NF-jB activation,
TNFR1 siRNA was utilized to reduce the expression
level of TNFR1 in MDAPanc-28 cells. Western blot
analysis showed that the level of TNFR1 was substantially decreased with TNFR1 siRNA (Fig. 4G) and that
TNFR1 siRNA-mediated inhibition of TNFR1 expression suppressed FADD phosphorylation and caspase8 activation in FUT-175-treated cells with or without
TNF-a stimulation (Fig. 4H). These results suggest
that caspase-8 activation is dependent on FUT-175induced TNFR1 expression. To determine whether apoptosis was induced in AsPc-1, Panc-1, and Capan-1
cells, and immortalized/nontumorigenic pancreatic
ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells, DNA fragmentation
analysis was performed. As shown in Figure 4I, DNA
fragmentation was induced in FUT-175-treated AsPc1 cells at 24 hours and 48 hours, but no DNA fragmentation was detected in FUT-175-treated HPDE cells.
No DNA fragmentation was detected in Panc-1 and

Capan-1 cells (data not shown). FUT-175-induced
DNA fragmentation in AsPc-1 cells can be reduced by
TNFR1 siRNA (Fig. 4I, Lanes 8 and 9), confirming the
role of TNFR1 in FUT-175-induced apoptosis. Taken
together, these results suggest that apoptosis and caspase-8 activation is dependent on FUT-175-induced
TNFR1 expression.

The Expression of Transcription Factor PEA3 Is Involved
in FUT-175-Mediated TNFR1 Expression
To determine the effect of FUT-175 on other major
cellular signaling pathways, we examined the activities of AKT and Erk by Western blot analysis and AP-1
activity by EMSA, as shown in Figure 5. The results
showed that AKT phosphorylation was not altered,
but Erk phosphorylation was inhibited in AsPc-1,
Panc-1, and MDAPanc-28 cells, but not in Capan-1
cells (Fig. 5A). AP-1 activity was found to be inhibited
by FUT-175 (Fig. 5B).
To investigate how FUT-175 induces TNFR1
expression in MDAPanc-28 cells, we cloned the 1093bp promoter region of the human tnfr1 gene.24 The
promoter of TNFR1 resembles housekeeping-type
promoters in that it drives transcription from multiple
start points in the C1T-rich region and lacks canonical TATA and CAAT box motifs.24 Deletion analysis

antiapoptotic activity by inhibiting IjBa phosphorylation and induce TNFRmediated apoptosis by up-regulating PEA3-mediated TNFR1 expression.

showed that the enhancer region was between nucleotides 384 and 211 (Fig. 6A). To determine whether
this region actively interacts with transcription factors, we performed EMSA using 2 overlapping oligonucleotides (A and B) as indicated in Fig. 6B to
examine DNA binding activity. As shown in Fig. 6C, 2
complexes (C1 and C2) interacted with oligonucleotide probe B, and the DNA-binding activity of complex C1 was increased by FUT-175 stimulation. DNA
sequence analysis demonstrated that oligonucleotide
B contains a PEA3-binding site and multiple Sp1binding sites (Fig. 6B). By using EMSA with wild-type
and mutant PEA3-binding site oligonucleotides, PEA3
was shown to be present in the FUT-175-inducible
complex C1 (Fig. 6C). Sp1 may present in a C2 complex that remained unchanged upon stimulation of
FUT-175 (Fig. 6C). To determine whether PEA3 binds
to the PEA3 site identified in the tnfr1 promoter in
vivo in FUT-175-stimulated MDAPanc-28 cells, we
performed ChIP assays. The tnfr1 promoter DNA
sequence was amplified from the anti-PEA3 chromatin immunoprecipitates from FUT-175-stimulated
MDAPanc-28 cells in the PCR reaction using the specific PCR primers flanking the PEA3 site in the tnfr1
promoter region, suggesting that PEA3 directly interacted with this site (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, the expression level of PEA3 was induced by FUT-175 in
MDAPanc-28 cells (Fig. 6E). To further determine that
the tnfr1 promoter was induced by PEA3, a luciferase
reporter assay was performed in MDAPanc-28 cells
transfected with PEA3 expression vector and tnfr1
promoter with wild-type or mutant PEA3 binding sites
(Fig. 6F). Luciferase activity was found to be much
higher in the cells transfected with the tnfr1 promoter
containing a wild-type PEA3 binding site (Fig. 6F).
Taken together, these data indicate that the induction
of tnfr1 gene expression by FUT-175 is likely mediated
directly by PEA3.

DISCUSSION
As summarized in Figure 4G, our results demonstrated that FUT-175 is both a potent inhibitor of NFjB activity by blocking IKK-mediated phosphorylation
of IjBa, and a strong inducer of apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of TNFR1, thereby enhancing
TNFR1-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest a
possible mechanism by which FUT-175 suppresses
NF-jB antiapoptotic activity and induces TNFRmediated apoptosis.
TNFR1 signaling initiates both pro-survival and
cell death signal cascades, and the balance between
survival and apoptosis signals decides the destiny of
the cell.5 Many studies have shown that proapoptotic

signals induce NF-jB, which in turn induces expression of the genes involved in suppressing apoptotic
signals.1,5 Inhibitors of apoptosis c-IAP1 and c-IAP2
and Bcl-2 family members Bcl-xL and Bfl1/A1 have
been proposed to mediate NF-jB-dependent antiapoptotic signaling.1 Activation of TNFR1 leads to the
recruitment of TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), and TRADD binds to FADD to recruit
caspase-8 and jBid to induce apoptosis.5 Conversely,
TRADD also requires TRAF2 and RIP to initiate NF-jB
activation to modulate expression of apoptotic genes.5
Therefore, the induction of TNF-dependent apoptosis
requires inhibition of NF-jB.1 The results of the current study demonstrate that FUT-175 induces the
expression of TNFR1, which in turn activates caspase8 and jBid to initiate apoptosis, and simultaneously
inhibits the phosphorylation of IjBa to block NF-jB
activation, thereby suppressing NF-jB-dependent
antiapoptotic signaling. Thus, through this mechanism, FUT-175 appears to be a potent apoptotic inducer. Inhibition of TNFR1 with siRNA suppressed
FUT-175-mediated TNFR1 expression, caspase-8 activation, and apoptosis, which suggests that TNFR1 is
essential for FUT-175-mediated activation of caspase8 and hence the induction of apoptosis. FUT-175
induced the formation of jBid, which is generated
through MKK7/JNK-mediated Bid processing in TNFinduced apoptosis and is different from the cleavage
product of Bid by caspase-8.23 Thus, FUT-175-induced
apoptosis appears to be mediated by 2 distinct pathways, MKK7/JNK activation and FADD/caspase-8
activation. However, Panc-1 and Capan-1 cells appear
to be resistant to FUT-175-induced apoptosis (data
not shown). The resistance to FUT-175-induced apoptosis in Panc-1 cells might be explained by the fact
that the level of TNFR1 expression in Panc-1 cells was
very high and Panc-1 cells might adopt a mechanism
to inhibit apoptotic signals induced by a very high
basal level of TNFR1 expression. The resistance to
FUT-175-induced apoptosis in Capan-1 cells might be
due to the uninducible expression of TNFR1 by FUT175. These findings also imply that FUT-175 has effect
on cell growth, possibly due to the inhibition of NFjB activity.
Although FUT-175 was synthesized years ago, to
our knowledge its molecular basis of action and
effects on various cells remain unclear. Our findings
suggest a possible mechanism by which FUT-175 may
disrupt interconnected signaling pathways by both
suppressing the NF-jB antiapoptotic activity and
inducing TNFR-mediated apoptosis. These observations support our supposition that this synthetic serine protease inhibitor is a potential therapeutic agent
for pancreatic cancer.

The mechanism, by which FUT-175 inhibits IKKmediated phosphorylation of IjBa, remains unclear
and is an ongoing area of research. Using an in vitro
kinase assay, Tando et al. demonstrated that CCKinduced, but not TNF-a-induced, IKK activation was
inhibited by a seine protease inhibitor, pefabloc, and
they also compared pefabloc-mediated and FUT175mediated inhibition of trypsin-induced IKK activation.25 These findings further support the theory that
FUT175 is an IKK inhibitor. The results of the current
study suggest that the TNFR1-mediated signaling
cascades that activate NF-jB may require a step involving a FUT-175-sensitive serine protease. The function
of FUT-175 in the suppression of inflammatory
responses is largely attributed to its inhibitory effect
on proteases.11,14 The results presented in the current
study suggest that the inhibitory effect of FUT-175 on
NF-jB activation may also play a role in the suppression of inflammatory responses. Moreover, because of
its dual function of NF-jB inhibition and apoptosis
induction, FUT-175 may be a potentially useful therapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer.
