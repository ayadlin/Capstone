Abstract
The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the nuclear
steroid hormone receptor family and is thought to play an
important role in the development of both androgendependent and androgen-independent prostatic malignancy.
Elucidating roles by which cofactors regulate AR transcriptional activity may provide therapeutic advancement for
prostate cancer (PCa). The DEAD box RNA helicase p68
(Ddx5) was identified as a novel AR-interacting protein by
yeast two-hybrid screening, and we sought to examine the
involvement of p68 in AR signaling and PCa. The p68-AR
interaction was verified by colocalization of overexpressed
protein by immunofluorescence and confirmed in vivo by
coimmunoprecipitation in the PCa LNCaP cell line. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation in the same cell line showed AR and
p68 recruitment to the promoter region of the androgenresponsive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene. Luciferase
reporter, minigene splicing assays, and RNA interference
(RNAi) were used to examine a functional role of p68 in ARregulated gene expression, whereby p68 targeted RNAi
reduced AR-regulated PSA expression, and p68 enhanced
AR-regulated repression of CD44 splicing (P = 0.008). Tyrosine
phosphorylation of p68 was found to enhance coactivation
of ligand-dependent transcription of AR-regulated luciferase
reporters independent of ATP-binding. Finally, we observe
increased frequency and expression of p68 in PCa compared
with benign tissue using a comprehensive prostate tissue
microarray (P = 0.003; P = 0.008). These findings implicate p68
as a novel AR transcriptional coactivator that is significantly
overexpressed in PCa with a possible role in progression to
hormone-refractory disease. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7938–46]

Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of male cancer
deaths with >670,000 men diagnosed worldwide each year. PCa
incident rates for the United States, European Union, and the
United Kingdom are currently 125, 106.2, and 107.3 cases per
100,000 men, respectively (1, 2). The onset and progression of PCa
is driven by the transcriptional function of the androgen receptor

(AR), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of
transcriptional factors. Ablation of androgens, the major AR ligand,
is a therapeutic modality in the early stages of the disease.
However, PCa can progress to a hormone-refractory phenotype
(HRPCa) due to mechanisms that are largely undefined. The
majority of HRPCa still express AR and AR-regulated genes,
indicating that an active AR-signaling cascade is maintained
despite castrate levels of androgens (3). A suggested mechanism for
maintenance of a functionally active AR is aberrant expression of
AR cofactors leading to increased AR sensitivity or promiscuous
activation of AR by other steroid hormones (4, 5). There are
currently no curative therapeutic agents for HRPCa (6).
The p68 DEAD box RNA helicase (Ddx5) is a growth and
developmentally regulated prototypic member of the DEAD box
family of enzymes, and an established RNA helicase. p68 has been
found to play a role in a wide range of cellular functions, including
pre-mRNA, rRNA, and microRNA processing (7, 8), ribosome
biogenesis, and cell proliferation (9), transcription (reviewed in
refs. 10, 11) and transcriptional deactivation by promotion of
mRNA transcript release in Drosophila (12). A role for p68 in
transcription is underscored through its interaction with components of the transcription machinery and other transcriptionrelated factors [RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), CBP, p300, HDAC1,
and Smad3; ref. 10]. There is now considerable evidence indicating that p68 is a potent transcriptional coactivator of estrogen
receptor a (13–15); tumor suppressor p53 (16); MyoD (17), and
h-catenin (18).
p68 has been shown to be overexpressed and polyubiquitylated
in colorectal tumors (19), suggesting that posttranslational
changes or modification of p68 expression may play a role in
tumor development. In addition, modification of p68 by the small
ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO-2 was found to modulate the
activity of p68 as a transcriptional regulator, favoring an action
as a repressor (20, 21). Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation on
Y593 of p68 by c-Abl was shown to be associated with cellular
transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colon
cancer (22–24)—although controversy exists as to whether this is
through p68 nuclear translocation of h-catenin (25)—and tyrosine
phosphorylation of p68 at this residue has also been shown to be
important in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induced cell
proliferation through the up-regulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc
expression (24). Together, these findings indicate that the DEAD
box RNA helicase p68 plays an important role in transcriptional
regulation, and posttranslational modifications of the helicase
may be important in tumor development. In this study, we identify p68 as a novel AR coactivator and explore the relationship
between p68 with AR signaling in PCa and suggest a role for p68
in cancer progression.

The Novel AR Coactivator p68 Is Overexpressed in PCa

Materials and Methods
Yeast two-hybrid assay. p68 was identified from a prostate library
(Clontech) in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the AR bait clones pGBKT7ARDS (containing the AR-DNA and steroid binding domains, but lacking
the NH2 terminal domain) and pGBT9-AGA (with a substituted AR-DNA
binding domain for a GAL4 binding domain), as previously described (26).
Cell culture. All cells were grown at 37jC in 5% CO2. LNCaP cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640, COS-7, and HEK 293 cells in DMEM plus 1%
L-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen) or 10%
Dextran Charcoal Stripped FCS (Hyclone) to produce steroid-depleted
media, as detailed in figure legends. Where indicated, cells were treated
with 10 nmol/L R1881 (methyltrienolone).
Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a tissue microarray (TMA) of benign and
malignant prostate biopsies derived from transrectal biopsy, transurethral
resection, and radical prostatectomy as previously described (27). All
materials were used in accordance with approval granted by the
Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Strategic Health Authority Research
Ethics Committee (reference 2003/11; The Freeman Hospital). The average
core loss was 28%, and the final study included 147 cancer biopsies and 44
benign biopsies. Antigen retrieval was achieved by immersion in 10 mmol/L
citric acid buffer (pH 6.0), followed by microwaving for 15 min (at 1,000 W)
in a pressure cooker. Sections were immunostained with PAb204 (mouse
monoclonal antibody against p68, Upstate) on a DAKO autostainer using
Vectastain ABC kits (Vector Labs), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Sections known to stain positively were included in each batch, and
negative controls were prepared by replacing the primary antibody with
TBS buffer. p68 expression was scored blindly by intensity of staining in

each biopsy core as being absent (0), weak (+), moderate (++), or strong
(+++). Sections were viewed on a Nikon Eclipse 600 microscope, and images
were captured using a Nikon OXM1200 camera with Eclipse net software.
Plasmids, antibodies, and drugs. The plasmids p(ARE)3 Luc, pCMV-hgal, pcDNA3-ARWT (26), GFP-ARWT (28), pcDNA3-p68WT, pcDNA3-p72WT
(16, 29), pCMV-c-Abl (30), pGFP3-Sam68 (31), pcDNA3-p68GLT, and pSG5p68Y593F, described previously, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis
of p68WT and ligated into appropriate vectors. The YFP-p68 construct, CDM
and CD44v5 minigenes, were kind gifts from Angus Lamond (University of
Dundee), Bert O’Malley (Baylor College of Medicine), and Stefan Stamm
(University of Kentucky), respectively.
The antibodies p68 goat polyclonal, AR rabbit polyclonal C-19, and
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) goat polyclonal (Santa Cruz); p68 mouse
monoclonal (Upstate); AR mouse monoclonal (BD Pharmingen); TATA
binding protein mouse monoclonal (TBP-Abcam); a-tubulin mouse
monoclonal (Sigma); c-Abl mouse monoclonal (Chemicon); and P-Tyr-100
and myc mouse monoclonal (Cell Signaling) were used as stated in figure
legends.
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib was obtained from the Pharmacy
Department of the Royal Victoria Infirmary Hospital.
Immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry was performed on HEK
293 cells transfected with 1 Ag of GFP-AR and/or YFP-p68 construct using
Superfect (Qiagen), as described previously (28). Transfected cells were
placed in steroid depleted media for 24 h and then treated with 10 nmol/L
R1881 for a further 16 h before fixing them in methanol. Slides were
visualized using laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica).
Luciferase reporter and minigene splicing assays. Luciferase reporter
assays were performed on COS-7 cells cotransfected in triplicate with 0.1 Ag

detailed in figure legends. RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and
reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) performed using the One-Step RT-PCR
kit (Qiagen). Densitometric band quantification was performed as
previously described (33). The identities and sizes of bands were verified
by sequencing.

independent experiments F SE.
Cell lysate extraction and coimmunoprecipitation. LNCaP cells were
cultured in steroid depleted media for 48 h before 10 nmol/L R1881
treatment for 8 h. Cells were nuclear extracted using CelLytic NuCLEAR
extraction kit with an extraction buffer salt concentration of 330 mmol/L
in the presence of PhosStop phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) and RNase A
(100 Ag/mL; Sigma). AR and p68 coimmunoprecipitation experiments were
performed as described previously (34).
RNA interference and quantitative real-time PCR. LNCaP cells seeded
in six-well plates were transfected with p68 or nonsilencing (NS) small
interfering RNA (siRNA) using RNAifect (Qiagen), according to manufacturer’s instructions. The p68 and NS siRNA oligonucleotides have been
described previously (16, 35). Transfected cells and nontreated controls
(C) were grown in steroid-depleted media for 24 h and then treated with

10 nmol/L R1881 for a further 16 h. Cells were harvested in either SDS
sample buffer (protein) or TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, followed by RT-PCR)
to study mRNA expression by quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) relative
to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression as
previously described (35). Oligonucleotides were used to determine p68
(CACATCAATCATCAGCCATTCCT and CAAACAAATAGGCCCATCGC) and
AR (GGACTTGTGCATGCGGTACTCA and CCTGGCTTCGGCAACTTACAC)
mRNA expression. The PSA and GAPDH oligonucleotides have been
described previously (34).
Chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed in LNCaP cells, as described previously
(35), in the presence of RNase A (100 Ag/mL). p68 and AR bound chromatin
was immunoprecipitated using 2 Ag of p68 goat or AR rabbit polyclonal C19
antibody, respectively. QPCR was performed on inputs and recovered
material to assess the co-occupancy of AR and p68 to the proximal ARE I
within the PSA promoter and distal ARE III within the PSA enhancer, as
described previously (34). The results of all ChIP assays shown are the mean
of at least three independent experiments F SE.
Statistical analysis. The independent sample t test was used to compare
differences in the ratio of exon skipping/inclusion products between groups
in the minigene assays. For immunohistochemistry, differences in the
frequency and expression of p68 between groups were examined using
Fisher’s exact test and Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. Correlations with
Gleason grade (GG) were undertaken using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Patient
survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank testing,
and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression model.
All tests were undertaken using SPSS version 11.0 computer software (SPSS,
Inc.). All tests were two-sided and a P value of <0.05 was taken to indicate
statistical significance.

The Novel AR Coactivator p68 Is Overexpressed in PCa

Results
p68 is a novel nuclear AR-interacting protein in PCa cells.
The conserved helicase core (amino acids 203–353) of the p68
DEAD box RNA helicase was identified as a positive clone during a
yeast two-hybrid screen for novel AR-interacting partners.
Subsequent immunoblot analysis showed nuclear localization of
p68 in three different cell lines (Fig. 1A), that was unaffected by
androgen treatment in the PCa LNCaP cell line (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Accordingly, nuclear colocalization of cotransfected
p68WT-YFP and ARWT-GFP tagged constructs in HEK 293 cells
grown in the presence of androgen was observed by confocal
microscopy (Fig. 1B). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with
nuclear extracts of LNCaP cells further showed that the
endogenous p68 and AR interaction was enhanced in the presence
of androgens (Fig. 1C). However, it is notable that the AR gene is
itself androgen responsive and so the enhanced interaction is most
likely due to an increase in AR levels and not due to a higher
interaction affinity in the presence of androgens. No difference in
the intensity of the AR protein band was seen between FRNasetreated samples (in the presence of androgens), suggesting that the

AR-p68 interaction was not RNA-dependent. Together, these data
provide evidence that p68 interacts with the AR in the nucleus of
prostate cells and could thus function as a potential AR
coregulator.
Role of p68 as an AR coactivator. The LXXLL motif is observed
in cofactors that interact with ligand-activated nuclear hormone
receptors (36). We found that p68 contained an LXXLL motif at
amino acid 146, which was a strong indicator that p68 would act as
a transcriptional coregulator of the AR. To further explore this, we
undertook ChIP assays to confirm p68 and AR cooccupancy at
androgen-responsive elements (ARE) within the promoter and
enhancer regions of the androgen-responsive PSA gene. Both p68
and AR were dynamically recruited to the ARE I and ARE III
regions of the PSA promoter and enhancer, respectively (Fig. 2A
and B), with maximal observed recruitment to both regions at
80 min after androgen stimulation. These results clearly show the
presence of p68 at the active promoter of an AR-regulated gene,
suggesting a putative role for p68 in AR-dependent transcriptional
initiation.
To further examine whether p68 coregulates AR activity,
luciferase reporter assays driven by androgen-responsive fragments

mutant (full media + 10 nmol/L R1881) immunoprecipitated with c-Abl mouse monoclonal antibody and sequentially probed with myc (p68Y593F) or c-Abl mouse
monoclonal antibody. C, (ARE)3 luciferase reporter plus 0.1 Ag pcDNA3-AR and increasing concentrations of pcDNA3-p68WT, pcDNA3-p68Y593F, and/or pcDNA3-c-AblWT

75, and 100 ng, respectively. Data is shown relative to AR activity alone from at least three separate luciferase assay experiments (FSE).

of the PSA promoter were used to monitor AR transcriptional
activity. AR-mediated reporter activity was robustly stimulated by
the addition of androgens, and in the presence of p68; we observed
a dose-dependent coactivation of AR-mediated activity above ARalone levels (Fig. 2C). p68 did not directly affect luciferase reporter
activity in the absence of AR (Supplementary Fig. S2), illustrating
that p68 was not acting via AR-independent pathways.
ATP-dependent helicase enzymes, such as p68, use the binding
of ATP to increase the affinity and specificity of binding to RNA.
Using ATPase mutants, we sought to investigate whether the ATP
binding/hydrolysis activity of p68 had a functional role in AR
coactivation. An ATPase A (p68GLT) mutant maintained AR
coactivation above levels of AR alone (Fig. 2D), similar to findings
with a mutant directed to the ATPase B (p68NEAD) domain of p68
(data not shown), confirming that neither a conformational change
upon p68 ATP binding nor helicase activity was required for p68
coactivation of the AR. This supports previous findings with other
p68 interacting partners that showed ATPase/RNA helicase activity
was not required for transcriptional function (13, 16, 17).
To determine whether post-translational modifications were
necessary for AR coactivation, we used a p68Y593F mutant that was
not tyrosine-phosphorylated at Y593 in luciferase reporter assays.
We found that the p68Y593F mutant was unable to increase the
activation of AR over AR-alone levels compared with p68WT,
indicating that the phosphorylation of p68 at Y593 was important
for coactivation of the AR (Fig. 3A). In addition, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that p68 was tyrosine phosphorylated
and associated with c-Abl in the PCa LNCaP cell line (Fig. 3B),
although LNCaP cells transiently transfected with the p68Y593F
mutant also showed an interaction with c-Abl, indicating that sites
other than Y593 may be phosphorylated by c-Abl. Further luciferase
reporter assays showed that increasing amounts of c-Abl in the
presence of a low concentration of p68WT enhanced coactivation of
AR over p68WT alone (Fig. 3C). c-Abl had no enhanced effect on

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

luciferase reporter activity in the presence of the p68Y593F mutant
or in the absence of AR and/or p68WT, indicating that c-Abl was
neither enhancing the effect of AR directly nor acting via ARindependent pathways. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays
showed a decrease in coactivation of the AR by p68WT in the
presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (10 Amol/L)
compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these data
show that p68 is a coactivator of the AR, independent of the
helicase function of p68, and c-Abl activity enhances coactivation
through the tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 at Y593.
The highly homologous p72 DEAD box RNA helicase (Ddx17)
has been shown to interact with p68 and coactivate both estrogen
receptor a and MyoD (14, 17). Therefore, we examined the effect
of p72 on AR-mediated luciferase reporter activity. p72 did not
enhance AR-regulated transcriptional activity above levels seen
with AR alone (Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover, increasing
amounts of p72 had no effect on p68-mediated coactivation of AR
transcriptional activity (at a low p68 concentration), and increasing
p68 and p72 amounts (at the same concentration) did not enhance
AR-mediated transcriptional activity over levels observed with p68
alone. These data show that p72 does not function as an AR
transcriptional coregulator either alone or in conjunction with p68.
p68 knockdown by RNA interference reduces AR and PSA
protein and mRNA expression. To determine a physiological role
for p68 in AR transcriptional activity, we examined the effects of
RNA interference (siRNA)–mediated silencing of endogenous p68
gene expression on the expression of AR and the AR-regulated
androgen-responsive PSA gene in vivo in the LNCaP cell line. In the
presence of androgens, p68 targeted siRNA (but not NS siRNA)
reduced the expression of p68 mRNA (>60%; Fig. 4B) and protein
(Fig. 4A) compared with control (non–siRNA transfected) LNCaP
cells. Furthermore, a reduction in the expression of PSA and AR
mRNA (f40% and f60%, respectively; Fig. 4C and D) and protein
(Fig. 4A) was also seen with p68 targeted siRNA compared with NS

controls. The AR is an androgen-responsive gene itself, and these
findings clearly show that p68 targeted RNAi in PCa cells in the
presence of androgens reduces protein expression of both the AR
and the AR-regulated PSA gene. These data are strong evidence
that p68 is an important coactivator of AR-mediated genes.
p68 enhances AR-dependent repression of splicing of a
hormone-responsive CD44 variable exon minigene. Although
p68 plays key roles in alternative splicing in some contexts, e.g., in
splice site stability, spliceosome assembly, and H-ras splicing
(reviewed in ref. 10), it is unable to directly affect CD44 variable exon inclusion (ref. 37; Supplementary Fig. S4). However,
transcriptional coregulators of nuclear hormone receptors have
been shown to affect splicing events (32, 38, 39). The AR has
recently been shown to repress splicing of a CD44 variable exon
minigene downstream of a hormone-responsive promoter (31, 39).
Because p68 is recruited to the PSA promoter and coactivates ARdependent transcription, we considered the possibility that p68
may also modulate AR-dependent splicing. We used a CD44
variable exon v4 and v5 minigene under the transcriptional
control of the hormone-responsive mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV) promoter (CDM) transfected into HEK 293 cells with
expression constructs encoding AR and/or p68 (Fig. 5A). RT-PCR

and band densitometry (Fig. 5B and C), to study alternatively
spliced transcripts, showed that p68 enhanced AR-mediated exon
skipping in the presence of androgens (compare the ratio of exon
skipping/inclusion product in lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5 and 6;
P = 0.008).
p68 protein expression in clinical prostate biopsies. Because
other AR transcriptional coregulators have been shown to be
overexpressed in PCa (40), we decided to examine p68 protein
expression by immunostaining of a prostate TMA containing 147
cancer and 44 benign biopsies. The incidence of p68 expressing
biopsies was significantly greater in the PCa cohort (66 of 147; 45%)
compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; 11 of 44, 25%,
P = 0.003, two-sided Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 6A). In addition, an
increasing frequency of p68 expression was observed with
increasing GG tumors [GG3 = 14 of 38 (37%), GG4 = 23 of 51
(45%), GG5 = 26 of 55 (47%)], although the trend did not reach
statistical significance (P = 0.3, Kruskal-Wallis test; Fig. 6B and C).
Up-regulation in the level of p68 expression by nearly 3-fold was
seen in PCa biopsies compared with BPH (P = 0.008, MannWhitney test; Fig. 6D). No statistical correlation with local stage,
PSA, metastases, time treatment failure, or survival was seen with

Discussion
A number of AR transcriptional coregulators have been
identified by our group and others that play a role in PCa (40).
In this study, we reveal a novel role for the DEAD box RNA helicase
p68 as an AR coactivator in PCa. Our results show that p68 is an
AR-interacting protein and is associated with the AR at the
promoter region of an androgen-responsive gene (PSA). By
overexpression of p68 in luciferase reporter assays, we show a
functional role for p68 as an AR transcriptional coactivator,
dependent on Y593 phosphorylation, but independent of ATPbinding. Furthermore, p68 coactivator function was verified
in vivo in PCa cells by p68 targeted RNAi demonstrating reduced
expression of androgen-responsive endogenous protein (AR
and PSA).
The requirement of ATP dependency in p68-mediated transcription is conflicting. A recent study suggested that ATP binding was
required for the transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 by tyrosine
phosphorylated p68 (24). However, helicase inactive ATPase
mutants have been shown to coregulate transcription as efficiently
as wild type for several other transcription factors (13, 14, 16,
17, 29), suggesting that the function of p68 as a transcriptional
coregulator is independent of its RNA helicase activity. In
agreement with these findings, we also show p68 ATPase mutants

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

maintain coactivator function in ARE luciferase reporter assays
demonstrating that neither ATPase activity nor a conformational
change upon p68 ATP binding is required for AR coactivation. At
present, it is unclear why the ATP-dependent activity of tyrosine
phosphorylated p68 is specifically required for the transcription of
the cyclin D1 promoter (24), but it may reflect differences in the
way p68 functions as a direct transcriptional activator and as a
coregulator.
The COOH terminal domain of p68 can bind single-stranded
RNA and has been shown to be a target for protein kinase C (41).
Phosphorylation of the COOH terminal domain of p68 consequently abolished RNA binding, and it was hypothesized that
phosphorylated p68 may act as a molecular switch between
transcriptional functions and splicing (42). In this study, we show
that tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 on Y593 by c-Abl increased
transcriptional coactivation of the AR. The Y593 phosphorylation of
p68 has been implicated in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal
transition via PDGF- and c-Abl–dependent pathways (23). Paracrine
signaling and the role of stromal-epithelial interactions leading to
loss of cell-cell adhesion in PCa has been well documented (43).
Hence, a model where p68 may directly coactivate AR transcriptional activity and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transitiondriven PCa progression would be of notable interest.

The Novel AR Coactivator p68 Is Overexpressed in PCa

Recent evidence suggests that p68 may function as an ‘‘adaptor’’
or ‘‘coupling’’ protein that coordinates the tightly integrated
processes of transcription and mRNA processing (10, 44, 45). p68
has key roles in U1snRNP-5¶ splice site complex stability,
spliceosome assembly, pre-mRNA splicing (10), and mRNA
transcript clearance (12). In this study, we show that p68
potentiates AR-regulated repression of splicing of a CD44 variable
exon minigene. In contrast, the homologous DEAD box RNA
helicase p72 promotes CD44 exon inclusion downstream of a
hormone-responsive promoter (32). These results suggest that the
effect of p68 on AR-dependent splicing may be via transcriptional coregulatory mechanisms, possibly regulated by the posttranslational status of p68. Alternatively, recruitment of p68 to
endogenous AR-responsive genes may facilitate spliceosome
assembly and increase the rate of RNAPII elongation, affecting
splice site recognition and promotion of exon skipping in nascent
transcripts (46). AR is thought to enhance RNAPII elongation by
interacting with transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) and positive
transcription elongation factor b (47), which phosphorylate the
COOH terminal domain of RNAPII switching from a nonprocessive
to a processive form (48–50). In this study, we show p68 is involved
in both AR transcriptional coactivation and AR-mediated repression of splicing of an androgen-responsive gene. Therefore, p68
may serve as a common link between transcription and splicing
machinery. RNA processing activities are thought to be strongly
connected to efficient transcriptional coregulation, and this study
provides evidence for p68 as part of a ‘‘molecular link’’ that involves
the coupling of transcriptional initiation to mRNA processing.
Finally, we show that p68 is overexpressed in PCa biopsies
compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia controls. There is an
increase in the incidence of p68 expression by 2-fold and the level of
expression increases by 3-fold (P = 0.008), highlighting the clinical
significance of p68 in PCa. Not all PCa samples express p68, and this
may represent a specific mechanism of disease progression in a

discrete cohort. Although, there was limited correlation with other
clinicopathologic variables (grade, stage, PSA, and prognosis), a
putative role of p68 in PCa progression is shown by the functional
data and the increased levels of expression in clinical samples.
Identifying cofactors that influence the development of hormone
escape of PCa will be important in the development of effective
therapies and prevention of hormone refractory PCa. This study
provides strong evidence of the up-regulation of a novel AR
coactivator in PCa, which may play a significant role in progression to androgen independence, as well as a role in epithelialmesenchymal transition; activation of c-Abl pathways may enhance
p68 function as a coactivator of AR-dependent gene expression in
PCa. Hence, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, may be of
therapeutic benefit if posttranslational modifications are shown to
be important in modulating p68 function and affect disease
phenotypes.
