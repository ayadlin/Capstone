Abstract
A causative relationship between chronic inflammation and
cancer has been postulated for many years, and clinical
observations and laboratory experiments support the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to tumor onset and
progression. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the
relationship are not known. We recently reported that the
proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1B, induces the accumulation and retention of myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC), which are commonly found in many patients and
experimental animals with cancer and are potent suppressors
of adaptive and innate immunity. This finding led us to
hypothesize that inflammation leads to cancer through the
induction of MDSC, which inhibit immunosurveillance and
thereby allow the unchecked persistence and proliferation of
premalignant and malignant cells. We now report that host
MDSC have receptors for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and that
E-prostanoid receptor agonists, including PGE2, induce the
differentiation of Gr1+CD11b+ MDSC from bone marrow stem
cells, whereas receptor antagonists block differentiation.
BALB/c EP2 knockout mice inoculated with the spontaneously
metastatic BALB/c-derived 4T1 mammary carcinoma have
delayed tumor growth and reduced numbers of MDSC relative
to wild-type mice, suggesting that PGE2 partially mediates
MDSC induction through the EP2 receptor. Treatment of 4T1tumor–bearing wild-type mice with the cyclooxygenase
2 inhibitor, SC58236, delays primary tumor growth and
reduces MDSC accumulation, further showing that PGE2
induces MDSC and providing a therapeutic approach for
reducing this tumor-promoting cell population. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Chronic inflammation has long been correlated with tumor
onset and progression (1), and a causative relationship between
inflammation and cancer is supported by several lines of evidence.
For example, individuals with long-term chronic inflammatory
diseases are at higher risk of developing cancers of the target organ
(1–5), whereas patients and/or experimental animals taking
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are frequently protected
against the onset and/or progression of both primary tumor (6, 7)
and metastatic disease (8, 9). In addition, overexpression of certain
proinflammatory cytokines can result in increased tumor growth
and metastatic disease (10–13), and blocking these cytokines can

result in reduced tumor growth (10, 11). Furthermore, many tumors
secrete high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and/or agents,
including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; refs. 14–17), and therefore have
the potential to induce a local proinflammatory microenvironment.
Although these observations are consistent with the hypothesis
that chronic inflammation contributes to tumor onset and
progression, the precise mechanism(s) for this relationship remains
unclear.
We (18) and others (19) have shown that the proinflammatory
cytokine interleukin (IL)-1h induces accumulation and retention of
a population of cells called myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC). MDSC are found in many cancer patients and are potent
inhibitors of T-cell activation that cause a global and profound
immunosuppression (20–25). These findings suggest that MDSC
may be involved in the linkage between inflammation and cancer
and have led us to hypothesize that MDSC induced by
inflammation inhibit immunosurveillance, thereby facilitating
malignant transformation and tumor progression. We now show
using the spontaneously metastatic BALB/c-derived 4T1 mammary
carcinoma that PGE2 induces the accumulation and retention of
immunosuppressive MDSC, thereby providing a mechanistic
explanation for how inflammation leads to immunosuppression
and tumor progression.

days. PGE2 (2.6 Amol/L), Butaprost (5 Amol/L), anti-PGE2 antibody (6.25 AL/
10 mL), AH6809 (10 Amol/L), and/or AH23848 (10 Amol/L) were added to
some wells at the beginning of the 5-day culture. LPS (1 Ag/mL) was added to
some wells during the last 16 h of the 5-day culture. Half of the medium was
replaced every 48 h with fresh bone marrow medium. Resulting cells were
stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. Percentage increase in Gr1+CD11b+
cells was calculated as (100%)  [(Gr1+CD11b+ cells with drug)
(Gr1+CD11b+ cells without drug) / (Gr1+CD11b+ cells without drug)].
MDSC. MDSC were isolated from the spleens of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice
by magnetic bead sorting using Gr1 mAb and LS columns according to the
directions of the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified splenic MDSC
were >90% Gr1+CD11b+.
MDSC suppression assay. Putative suppressor cells were irradiated
(2,500 rad) and incubated with transgenic T cells plus antigen and T-cell
proliferation assessed as described (29). The arginase inhibitor, nor-NOHA,
was used at 500 AM. Transgenic T cells were similarly activated by peptide
in the presence or absence of nor-NOHA (without MDSC). Data are
expressed as the mean F SD of triplicate cultures.
Statistical analysis. Student’s t test for unequal variance was done using
Microsoft Excell 2000.

Results

Figure 1. MDSC from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice express E-prostanoid (EP )
receptors for PGE2. Splenocytes from 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were
triple labeled for Gr1-PE, CD11b-PerCP, and EP1-, EP2-, EP3-, or EP4-FITC
or with appropriate isotype control mAbs. Gr1+CD11b+ cells were gated and
analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of E-prostanoid receptors. Tumor
cells were trypsinized to remove the E-prostanoid receptors and serve as a
negative control.

Tumor inoculations, tumor growth, surgery, and COX-2 inhibitor
treatment. Mice were inoculated s.c. in the abdominal mammary gland
with 7,000 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells on day 0 and monitored for
tumor progression as described. In some experiments, primary tumors were
surgically removed as described (28). Mice treated with SC58236 were
injected s.c. thrice a week with SC58236 (3 mg/kg) beginning on the same
day they were inoculated with 4T1 (day 0) and continuing through day 21.
SC58236 was prepared as a 100 stock in ethanol and diluted in Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium for injection.
In vitro induction of MDSC. Bone marrow cells were harvested from the
femurs of BALB/c mice and depleted for T cells, B cells, macrophages,
granulocytes, neutrophils, and RBC using the mouse lineage cell depletion
kit and LS columns from Miltenyi Biotec according to the manufacturer’s
directions. Resulting cells were >50% ckit+ (CD117) as assayed by flow
cytometry. Lineage-depleted bone marrow cells were cultured at 1  105/mL
to 5  105/mL bone marrow medium (RPMI supplemented with 3% FCS, 1%
antibiotic-antimycotic, 1% gentamicin Life Technologies), including granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF; 20 ng/mL) and IL-4

procedure of ref. 30], in T25 flasks, 6- or 24-well plates at 37jC in 5% CO2 for 5

MDSC have receptors for PGE2. We have hypothesized that
inflammation may enhance tumor onset and progression by
inducing MDSC, which limit immunosurveillance, thereby facilitating tumor growth. Because PGE2 is secreted by many tumors
and is a central factor in inflammation, we have reasoned that
MDSC may be induced by PGE2. Therefore, we assayed MDSC for
the four E-prostanoid receptors for PGE2, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4.
BALB/c mice were inoculated on day 0 with 4T1 mammary
carcinoma cells, and their spleens were removed on day 36 when
their primary tumors were 9.9 mm in diameter. Following lysis of
the RBC, the remaining splenocytes were triple stained for the two
markers of mouse MDSC (Gr1 and CD11b), and the EP1, EP2, EP3,
or EP4 receptor. Gr1+CD11b+ MDSC represent 52.5% of splenocytes,
and these cells uniformly express all four E-prostanoid receptors
(Fig. 1). Because trypsin cleaves the E-prostanoid receptors,
trypsinized 4T1 cells served as a negative specificity control for
the E-prostanoid antibodies. Therefore, MDSC express receptors for
PGE2, making them potentially responsive to this prostaglandin.
E-prostanoid agonists induce MDSC differentiation;
E-prostanoid antagonists block differentiation. To determine
if PGE2 induces the differentiation of MDSC, bone marrow cells
were extracted from the femurs of BALB/c mice; lineage depleted
and the remaining cells were cultured with IL-4 and GM-CSF in the
presence or absence of PGE2 or the EP2 agonist Butaprost. After
5 days of culture, the resulting cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
for T cell (CD3), B cell (B220), stem cell (c-kit), dendritic cell (CD11c),
and MDSC (Gr1+CD11b+) markers. Gr1+CD11b+ cells increase by
2- to 3-fold in cultures supplemented with PGE2 or Butaprost
relative to medium-alone treatment (Fig. 2A). The accumulation of
MDSC seems to be at the expense of dendritic cells, because dendritic cell differentiation is reduced when PGE2 or Butaprost are
present.
The experiment of Fig. 2A indicates that MDSC induction is via
the EP2 receptor. To determine if induction also occurs through
the other PGE2 receptors, bone marrow cells were cultured with
PGE2 or Butaprost as in Fig. 2A, and the EP4 antagonist AH23848
and/or the EP1 and EP2 antagonist AH6809 were added to some
wells (Fig. 2B). Addition of either or both antagonists virtually
eliminates the induction of Gr1+CD11b+ cells, indicating that PGE2
mediates MDSC differentiation through either the EP1, EP2, and/
or EP4 receptors.

PGE2 Induces Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells

To ascertain that the Gr1+CD11b+ cells induced by PGE2 and
Butaprost have suppressive activity, bone marrow cells were
induced as in Fig. 2B and the resulting cells were irradiated and
cocultured with transgenic D011.10 T cells pulsed with ovalbumin
peptide. Negative controls for the culture process included
medium without PGE2 or Butaprost, or culture with LPS, an
inducer of mature macrophages and dendritic cell (Fig. 2C and D).
PGE2- and Butaprost-induced cells suppress T cell activation by
46% and 42%, respectively, whereas LPS-induced cells are not
suppressive. Therefore, PGE2 induces the accumulation of
Gr1+CD11b+ MDSC from bone marrow stem cells via EP1, EP2,
and/or EP4 receptors.
EP2-deficient mice have retarded primary tumor growth
and reduced MDSC accumulation. The experiments of Fig. 2
show that PGE2 induces MDSC differentiation through the EP1,
EP2, and/or EP4 receptors in vitro. If PGE2 also induces MDSC
in vivo, then EP2 / mice should have fewer MDSC and delayed
tumor growth relative to wild-type BALB/c mice. To test this
hypothesis, EP2 / and BALB/c mice were inoculated with 4T1 on
day 0 and primary tumors were measured weekly beginning on day
8. Mice were also bled on day 20, and the level of MDSC in the
blood was determined by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry.
Primary tumors grew more slowly, and MDSC levels were reduced
in EP2 / mice relative to wild-type BALB/c mice (Fig. 3A and B,
respectively). Because MDSC levels are frequently driven by tumor
mass, EP2 / mice may have fewer MDSC because their primary
tumors are smaller. To address this issue, the percentage of MDSC
in EP2 / and wild-type BALB/c mice with 6 to 7 mm diameter
primary tumors was compared. When EP2 / and wild-type BALB/
c mice have primary tumors of the same size, BALB/c mice have
significantly more Gr1+CD11b+ MDSC in their blood (Fig. 3C),
showing that primary tumor burden by itself does not dictate the
level of MDSC. Therefore, elimination of the EP2 receptor reduces
MDSC levels and retards primary tumor growth, indicating that
PGE2 mediates MDSC accumulation in vivo.
MDSC induced via the EP2 receptor have heightened
suppressive activity. To determine if MDSC induced through the
EP2 receptor are qualitatively different from MDSC induced by
other factors, we have compared the suppressive activity and
mechanism of suppression of MDSC harvested from wild-type
BALB/c and EP2-deficient mice. BALB/c and EP2 / mice were
inoculated on day 0 in the abdominal mammary gland with 7,000
4T1 cells; primary tumors were removed on day 22; and spleens

were removed on day 50 when the mice had extensive metastatic
disease. Gr1+CD11b+ cells were isolated from spleens by MACS
sorting. Sorted MDSC were cocultured with CD4+ DO11.10
transgenic T cells (specific for ovalbumin peptide 323 to 339
peptide) or CD8+ clone 4 transgenic T cells (specific for

E-prostanoid receptor agonists and/or antagonists. A, bone marrow cells

lesser extent the activation of CD8+ T cells, by producing arginase,
which degrades arginine, an essential amino acid (29). To
determine if 4T1-induced MDSC from EP2 / mice inhibit by the
same mechanism, nor-NOHA, an inhibitor of arginase, was added
to some of the D011.10 and clone 4 transgenic T-cell cultures of
Fig. 4. Nor-NOHA reverses the suppression CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
by both BALB/c and EP2 / MDSC, although it is more effective in
reducing suppression of CD4+ T cells than of CD8+ T cells.
Therefore, EP2-dependent and EP2-independent MDSC both
inhibit T-cell priming by the production of arginase, although

Cultures were pulsed with tritiated thymidine on day 3 and cells
were harvested and counted 16 h later. MDSC from both BALB/c
and EP2 / mice suppress the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
at a 1:2 ratio of T cells to suppressor cells (Fig. 4A), and the
suppressive effect diminishes with the inclusion of fewer
Gr1+CD11b+ cells (Fig. 4B). However, MDSC from EP2 / mice
are less suppressive than MDSC from BALB/c mice. Therefore,
MDSC from EP2 / mice have significantly less suppressive activity
on a per cell basis than MDSC from wild-type BALB/c mice,
suggesting that MDSC induced via the EP2 receptor are qualitatively
different from MDSC induced in the absence of the EP2 receptor.

PGE2 Induces Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells

EP2-dependent MDSC are more suppressive on a per cell basis
than EP2-independent MDSC.
Treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor reduces primary tumor
growth and delays MDSC accumulation. The biosynthetic
pathway for PGE2 involves the COX-2–catalyzed conversion of
arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the subsequent
modification of PGG2 by PGE synthase to PGE2. Because COX-2 is
essential for PGE2 synthesis, drugs that specifically block COX-2
reduce PGE-2–mediated inflammation (31). To determine if in vivo
interference with PGE-2 synthesis alters MDSC accumulation, wildtype BALB/c mice were inoculated on day 0 with 4T1 and
concomitantly treated with the COX-2 inhibitor, SC58236. SC58236
treatment delays 4T1 primary tumor growth (Fig. 5A) and reduces
MDSC accumulation (Fig. 5B). Therefore, inhibition of PGE2
biosynthesis in tumor-bearing mice retards tumor progression and
MDSC differentiation, consistent with the concept that inflammation promotes tumor growth through the induction of immunosuppressive cells.

Discussion
The association of chronic inflammation with tumor onset and
progression has been noted for many years, and inflammation
resulting from infections is thought to be responsible for as many
as 15% of the world’s malignant cancers (32). Although it is likely
that inflammation contributes to tumor progression through
multiple and diverse mechanisms (1, 32, 33), the causative events
connecting inflammation with cancer are not well understood.
PGE2, one of the major products of inflammation, is thought to
promote tumor growth by inducing neoangiogenesis (34) and by
inducing tumor cell apoptosis (35). This report shows that in
addition to these known effects, PGE2 also modulates tumor
growth by inducing the accumulation of MDSC, which, in turn,
suppress antitumor immunity. MDSC are present in many patients
and experimental animals with cancer (20–25). They block adaptive
immunity by inhibiting the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
(29, 36–38) and innate immunity by inhibiting natural killer cells
(39). In immunocompetent individuals, immunosurveillance protects against the development of premalignant cells and the
proliferation of malignant cells (40). However, individuals with
elevated MDSC are not fully immunocompetent (41); thus,
immunosurveillance is not effective. Therefore, inflammation
contributes to cancer onset and progression through the
production of PGE2, which induces suppressor cells, and, which,
in turn, counteracts the protective effects of immunosurveillance.
COX2 is produced by normal host cells in an inflammatory
microenvironment and is also overexpressed and secreted by many
tumor cells (42, 43). Therefore, both the onset and the progression
of tumors could be enhanced by PGE2. Chronic, low-grade
inflammation would facilitate the accumulation of MDSC, thereby
blocking tumor immunity and providing a favorable environment
for the expansion of premalignant cells, and the transition of these
cells to a malignant phenotype. Once a tumor is established, tumor
cell production of COX2 would maintain elevated MDSC levels,
further blocking tumor immunity and allowing the malignant cells
to proliferate without interference from the host’s immune system.
The availability of EP2 knockout mice on the BALB/c
background has allowed us to conclusively show that the EP2
receptor is involved in the induction of MDSC. Although knockout
mice for the other E-prostanoid receptors are not available on a
BALB/c background, the experiments of Fig. 2 indicate that MDSC

which was continued through day 21. Primary tumors were measured with a

are probably induced through other E-prostanoid receptors as well
(i.e., EP1 and EP4). Our findings that SC58236-treated and EP2
knockout mice have reduced, but not background, levels of MDSC
is consistent with the concept that the EP2 receptor is not the only
trigger for the induction of MDSC. This conclusion is also
supported by the observation that low levels of Gr1+CD11b+ cells
differentiate from bone marrow precursor cells in the absence of
PGE2 or E-prostanoid agonists. Other factors, including vascular
endothelial growth factor, IL-6 (20), GM-CSF (44), and transforming
growth factor h (45), have also been implicated in MDSC induction.
Because all of these factors are to some extent by-products of
inflammation, it remains unclear if MDSC induction is mediated
exclusively by inflammation or if there are non–inflammatorydependent factors that also control MDSC levels.
Yang et al. (46) have reported that EP2-deficient mice have
reduced tumor progression when inoculated with the C57BL6 3LL or
MC26 tumors. They noted that dendritic cell function and levels
were normal in tumor-bearing EP2-deficient mice, but were reduced
in tumor-bearing wild-type mice, and concluded that dendritic cell
abnormalities favored tumor progression by compromising tumor
immunity. Because PGE2 induces MDSC at the expense of dendritic
cell differentiation (Fig. 2A), and MDSC are known to accumulate in

mice with 3LL or MC26 tumors (47, 48), it is likely that at least some
of the immunodeficiency observed by Yang et al. is due to MDSC.
At least two other cell types also facilitate tumor progression by
interfering with immunosurveillance: CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells
and M2 macrophages. T regulatory cells promote tumor progression by blocking CD8+ T-cell activation and thereby inhibit tumor
immunity (49, 50). The suppressive activity of T regulatory cells is
driven by expression of the forkhead/winged helix transcription
factor (FOXP3) gene (51–53). PGE2 has been shown to induce
expression of the FOXP3 gene in CD4+ T cells and to increase the
expression of FOXP3 in existing T regulatory cells, thereby
promoting immunosuppression (54, 55). Interestingly, MDSC have
also been shown to induce T regulatory cells (56), raising the
possibility that in addition to the direct effects of PGE2 on T
regulatory cell differentiation, PGE2 may also indirectly activate
T regulatory cells through its induction of MDSC. M2 macrophages,
which produce high levels of arginase, favor tumor growth by
enhancing angiogenesis, tissue repair, and tissue remodeling (57).
Interestingly, PGE2 produced by tumor cells was recently shown to
induce arginase production in cells expressing the macrophage
marker CD11b, suggesting that tumor-secreted PGE2 also affects
immunosurveillance by polarizing macrophages toward a tumorpromoting phenotype (58).
Interruption of the PGE2 pathway in vivo has been shown to
delay and/or prevent tumor progression in many systems. For

example, in mouse models, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
that inhibit COX-1 and/or COX-2 reduce spontaneous metastatic
disease of transplantable tumors (8), delay primary tumor onset
and tumor progression in transgenic (59) and transplantable
(60, 61) models, and augment tumor immunity after vaccination
(62, 63). Antagonists of prostaglandin receptors also reduce
metastatic disease (9), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents
limit tumor progression in patients (6). The antitumor effects of
these agents have been attributed to various mechanisms, such as
enhancing angiogenesis (34) and inducing tumor cell apoptosis
(35). Our finding that PGE2 antagonists and COX-2 inhibitors
reduce MDSC levels adds another mechanism by which these
agents delay tumor progression, and provides additional reasons
for developing new drugs that block the PGE2 pathway without
having detrimental side effects.
