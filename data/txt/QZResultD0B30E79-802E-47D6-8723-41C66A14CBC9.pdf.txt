Abstract
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) mutations are responsive to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFRTKI). However, NSCLC patients with secondary somatic EGFR mutations are resistant
to EGFR-TKI treatment. In this study, we investigated the effect of TG101348 (a JAK2
inhibitor) on the tumor growth of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Cell proliferation,
apoptosis, gene expression and tumor growth were evaluated by diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotindUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, Western Blot and a xenograft mouse model,
respectively. Results showed that erlotinib had a stronger impact on the induction
of apoptosis in erlotinib-sensitive PC-9 cells but had a weaker effect on erlotinibresistant H1975 and H1650 cells than TG101348. TG101348 significantly enhanced
the cytotoxicity of erlotinib to erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells, stimulated erlotinibinduced apoptosis and downregulated the expressions of EGFR, p-EGFR, p-STAT3, BclxL and survivin in erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Moreover, the combined treatment
of TG101348 and erlotinib induced apoptosis, inhibited the activation of p-EGFR and
p-STAT3, and inhibited tumor growth of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells in vivo. Our
results indicate that TG101348 is a potential adjuvant for NSCLC patients during
erlotinib treatment.

Introduction

treatment [9-11].
Studies have shown that approximately 70% of
NSCLC patients present with somatic mutations in the
exons of the EGFR gene. These EGFR mutations include
the deletion mutation of DE746-A750 in exon 19 and the
leucine-to-arginine substitution at position 858 (L858R)
in exon 21 of the EGFR gene [12]. The NSCLC patients
with these EGFR mutations respond well to the treatment
with small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(EGFR-TKIs), including erlotinib [13, 14]. However,
most patients, even those markedly responsive to initial
treatment, develop resistance to EGFR-TKIs later [15].
Recent studies have shown that several mechanisms are
involved in the development of resistance to EGFR-TKIs:
secondary mutations of EGFR (e.g. T790M in exon 20
and D761Y, in exon 19) [12], amplification of MET [16],
persistent survivin overexpression [17, 18], constitutive

Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer death
worldwide [1, 2]. More than 80% of lung cancer patients
are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [1, 2]. NSCLC
is characterized by a number of gene point mutations
that disrupt the normal growth and survival of the lung
epithelium. Overexpression of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) has been shown in about 19%~51.4%
of NSCLC patients [3, 4] and has been related with poor
prognosis in NSCLC patients [5, 6]. EGFR, a receptor
tyrosine kinase, is aberrantly activated in several solid
tumors, especially in NSCLC [2]. Studies have shown
that EGFR-activated cell signaling plays important roles
in lung tumorigenesis and tumor progression [7, 8].
Therefore, targeting inhibition of EGFR signaling has
been demonstrated to be an effective approach for NSCLC

activation of JAK2/STAT3 [19-22] and the activation of
Ras phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways
[23, 24]. Developing new agents to overcome the EGFRTKI resistance would be important for long-term treatment
in NSCLC patients.
EGFR signaling, involved in multiple intracellular
pathways, promote cell proliferation and suppress
apoptosis [23, 25]. Constitutive activation of STAT3 is
a common characteristic in many solid tumors including
NSCLC. Although STAT3 activation is frequently attained
by JAK2 somatic mutations in hematologic malignancies,
similar mutations are not commonly seen in solid tumors.
Previous studies have shown that STAT3 activation
in solid tumors is commonly induced by hyperactive
growth factor receptors or autocrine cytokine signaling.
Constitutive STAT3 activation has been proposed to play
an important role in resistance to various small-molecule
therapies that target oncogene signaling pathways. Recent
studies have demonstrated that STAT3 is constitutively
activated in human NSCLC samples and in a variety
of NSCLC lines, independent of activating KRAS or
tyrosine kinase mutations [21]. NSCLC cells secrete
IL-6 and consequently activate STAT3 via autocrine
mechanism [26]. The EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC cells
express constitute activation STAT3 signaling [20]. These
data indicate that constitute activation of JAK2/STAT3
signaling plays critical roles in mediating the resistance
to EGFR-TKIs. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of
the gp130/JAK2 signaling pathway disrupts activation of
STAT3 [21]. Treatment of NSCLC cells with the JAK1/2
inhibitor suppresses growth in soft agar and xenograft
assays [21]. Therefore, targeting inhibition of JAK2/
STAT3 may be a new treatment approach in NSCLC
patients with EGFR-TKIs resistance.
TG101348 is a small-molecular highly selective
ATP-competitive JAK-2 inhibitor [27, 28]. TG101348
inhibits the proliferation of human erythroblast leukemia
(HEL) cell line that harbors the JAK2V617F mutation
as well as a murine pro-B cell line expressing human
JAK2V617F [27, 28]. Recent studies have shown that
TG101348 specifically decreases Hodgkin lymphoma and
mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma growth in vitro and
in vivo [29]. Clinical trials have shown that TG101348
is well tolerated and produces significant reduction in
disease burden and durable clinical benefit in patients
with myelofibrosis [30] . However, the potential effect of
TG101348 combined with erlotinib for NSCLC treatment
is unknown.
In this study, the effect of TG101348 on EGFRKI-resistant NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo was
determined. TG101348 was found to significantly increase
the cytotoxicity of erlotinib, enhance erlotinib-induced
apoptosis, and inhibit the tumor growth in EGFR-TTKIresistant NSCLC cells. Our results suggest that TG101348
is a promising treatment agent for NSCLC patients
resistant to erlotinib.

TG101348 induces apoptosis of NSCLC cells
Previous studies have shown that the aberrant
activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling was found in
NSCLC tumors [21]. It has been reported that PC-9 cells
is erlotinib-sensitive and H1650 cells and H1975 cells are
erlotinib-resistant [31]. We found that the levels of IL6, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in H1975 and H165 cells were
higher than in PC-9 cell (Supplementary Fig. 1A and 1B).
Further, knockdown of STAT3 sensitized H1975 cells to
erlotinib-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 2A and
2B), confirming that the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway is
involved in mediating resistance of erlotinib. To determine
the effect of TG101348 on apoptosis of NSCLC cells,
PC9, H1975 and H1650 were used. TG101348 treatment
markedly induced apoptosis in all three NSCLC cell lines
dose-dependently (Fig. 1A-1D) and time-dependently
(data not shown). This study focused on whether
TG101348 inhibited JAK/STAT3 signaling in these
NSCLC cells, and also studied the expression of molecules
of JAK2/STAT3 signaling in NSCLC cells treated with
TG101348. TG101348 treatment decreased the level of
p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in both H1975 cells and H1650
cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E-1F). TG101348
treatment inhibited expression of apoptosis-related
protein Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, survivin, XIAP, and resulted in the
cleavage of caspase 3 (Fig. 1E-1F, Supplementary Fig.
3). The results indicate that TG101348 induces apoptosis
in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells through the inhibition of
JAK2/STAT3 signaling.

TG101348 sensitizes erlotinib-resistant NSCLC
cells to the cytotoxicity of erlotinib
EGFR-mutant NSCLC H1975 and H1650 have been
reported to be erlotinib-resistant [19, 21, 32]. The effect of
TG1010348 on cell proliferation in EGFR-mutant NSCLC
was first studied to determine the effect of TG1010348 on
the resistance to erlotinib in these cells. Results showed
that erlotinib dramatically inhibited cell proliferation of
PC-9 cells. The IC50 of erlotinib was approximately 0.58
µM for PC-9 cells (Fig. 2A). H1975 cells and H1650 cells
were more resistant to erlotinib than PC-9 cells. The IC50
of erlotinib was 14.3 µM and 17.6 µM for H1950 cells
and H1650, respectively (Fig. 2A). The results further
confirmed that PC-9 cells is erlotinib-sensitive and H1650
cells and H1975 cells are erlotinib-resistant, consistent
with previous studies [31]. No significant difference in
inhibition rates were found among the three NSCLC cell
lines when treated with TG101348 (Fig. 2B), indicating
that TG101348 possesses strong inhibition in erlotinibresistant NSCLC cells than in erlotinib-sensitive NSCLC

combination of erlotinib and TG101348 to study whether
TG101348 reverses erlotinib resistance. When combined
with TG101348 (1.0 µM), erlotinib significantly increased
the inhibition of cell proliferation in H1975 cells (Fig.

treatment alone. These results suggest that TG101348 has
additive effect on erlotinib cytotoxicity to NSCLC cells.

We further investigated the effect of TG101348 on
cell transformation. Soft agar assay is a classic approach
to determine cell transformation in vitro. The result
showed that H1975 cells could form a large number of
colonies in soft agar, and erlotinib treatment slightly
inhibited colony formation (Fig. 3A-3B), suggesting that
H1975 cells are resistant to the inhibition of anchorageindependent growth of erlotinib. TG101348 treatment
significantly reduced colony formation of H1975 cells

significantly increased apoptosis in both H1975 cells
(Fig. 4B) and H1650 cells (Fig. 4C) compared to either
TG10138 or erlotinib as monotherapy. The results indicate
that TG101348 enhances erlotinib-induced apoptosis of
EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells.
To determine the underlying mechanisms by which
TG101348 enhances erlotinib-induced apoptosis in
EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells, we determined the effect of
TG101348 on EGFR and STAT3 signaling. Western Blot
showed that erlotinib decreased p-EGFR level but slightly
increased p-STAT3 expression (Fig. 4D). TG101348
downregulated pSTAT3 in H1650 cells (Fig. 4D). The
combination treatment of TG101348 and erlotinib inhibits
the activation of both p-EGFR and p-STAT3 (Fig. 4D).
Results showed that erlotinib did not affect
expression of survivin and Bcl-XL in H1650 cells
(Fig. 4D). In contrast, TG101348 markedly decreased
expression of survivin and Bcl-XL. Moreover, the

with erlotinib (1 µM) for 48 hours. Erlotinib treatment
markedly induced apoptosis of PC-9 cells, but only

and H1975 cells are resistant to erlotinib-induced
apoptosis. To investigate whether TG101348 increased
erlotinib-induced apoptosis of erlotinib-resistant cells,
H1650 and H1975 cells were treated with TG101348,

combination treatment of TG101348 and erlotinib
exhibited the strongest inhibition of (Fig. 4D). These
results suggest that the inhibition of expression of survivin
and Bcl-XL contributes to the TG101348-induced decrease
in erlotinib-resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells.

The results showed that erlotinib slightly inhibited tumor
growth while TG101348 significantly inhibited tumor
growth (Fig. 5A-5B, supplementary Fig. 4) and reduced
tumor weight (Fig. 5C-5D) in H1975 cells and H17650
cells compared to the control treatment. The combination
treatment of TG101348 and erlotinib exhibited stronger
inhibition of tumor growth and reduction of tumor
weight than TG101348 or erlotinib monotherapy (Fig.
5A-5D). These results suggest that TG101348 enhances
the response of EGFR-mutant NSCLC to erlotinib and
potentiates the antitumor effect of erlotinib in vivo.

Discussion

We further determined the mechanisms by which
TG101348 enhanced erlotinib-inhibition of tumor growth
in vivo. Tumors collected from erlotinib-treated mice
expressed lower levels of p-EGFR but higher levels of
p-STAT3 than tumors collected from DMSO-treated mice
(Fig. 6A-6C), suggesting that erlotinib treatment resulted
in activation of STAT3 signaling in vivo. Tumors from
the mice treated with TG101348 expressed significantly
lower levels of p-EGFR and p-STAT3 compared to the
tumors from the mice treated with DMSO. Moreover,
tumors from the mice treated with combination therapy of
TG101348 and erlotinib showed significantly lower levels
of p-EGFR and p-STAT3 than those of mice treated with
either monotherapy of TG101348 or erlotinib (Fig. 6A6C).
Consistent with inhibition of p-EGFR and p-STAT3,
cleavage caspase 3-positive cells (apoptotic cells) were
significantly higher in the tumors from the mice treated
with combination therapy of TG101348 and erlotinib
compared to tumors from the mice treated TG101348 or
erlotinib alone (Fig. 6A and 6D). These results indicate
that TG101348 enhance erlotinib-induced apoptosis in
NSCLC cells in vivo.

In the study, we showed that TG101348 significantly
enhanced erlotinib-inhibition of cell proliferation in
EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. The combination treatment
of TG101348 and erlotinib obviously decreased the
expressions of EGFR, p-EGFR, Bcl-xL and survivin,
suppressed the activation of STAT3, induced apoptosis
and inhibited tumor growth of EGFR-mutant NSCLC
cells in vivo. Our results demonstrate that TG101348 could
overcome erlotinib-resistance and enhance the anti-tumor
action of erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells.
EGFR-targeted treatment has been shown to provide
advantages over traditional chemotherapy for the advanced
NSCLC [9, 14]. Studies have demonstrated that erlotinib
is an effective drug for NSCLC patients with EGFR
mutations [33-35]. However, most NSCLC patients finally
develop resistance to EGFR-TKIs, including erlotinib. It
is still merge to develop effective therapies for erlotinibresistant patients. Studies have shown that the activation
of JAK2/STAT3 signaling contributes to the development
of erlotinib resistance [19, 26]. STAT3-mediated Akt
activation resulted EGFR-TKI resistance in lung cancer
cells [20]. Niclosamide reverses erlotinib resistance by
supressing STAT3 activation in NSCLC [36]. Our results
also showed that the the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway was
activated in erlotinib-resistant H1975 and H1650 cells
than in erlotinib-sensitive PC-9 cells. Knockdown of
STAT3 increased erlotinib-induced apoptosis in H1975
cells. These data indicate that inhibition of JAK2/ STAT3
activation may overcome erlotinib resistance [37].
TG101348 has been shown to inhibit cell
proliferation of primary hematopoietic cells and
erythroblast leukemia (HEL) cell line that harbors the
JAK2V617F mutation [27, 28]. TG101348 upregulates
FOXO1 mRNA and protein expression in mediastinal B
cell lymphoma cell lines MedB-1 and U2940 and inhibit
the growth of mediastinal B cell lymphoma [38]. In
addition, TG-101348 has been shown to modulate immune
function [39]. TG-101348 preserves Treg numbers and
thereby enhances the ratio of CD4(+) Tregs to CD8(+)
CD25(+) effector T cells, and also reduces the production
of IL-6 and TNF-α [39]. Data suggest that TG-101348 has
multiple functions in tumor inhibition.
EGFR signaling has been recognized as an
important regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis
[23]. A previous study has shown that a novel EGFR
inhibitor promotes apoptosis of H1975 cells, but not
that of H1650 cells [31]. In this study, we found that
TG101348 potentiates erlotinib-induced apoptosis in both
H1975 cells and H1650 cells. Recent data shows that the
combination therapy of TG-101348 and BI-2536 (PLK1
inhibitors) synergistically targets oncogenic pathways
[38] and that the combination therapy of TG101348 and

The combination of TG101348 and erlotinib
prolongs survival time of tumor-bearing mice
The effect of combined treatment of TG101348 and
erlotinib on the long-term survival of mice bearing tumor
was determined. The experimental end point was defined
as the time when an entire group of mice died. Death was
defined as natural death if tumor burden or tumor size was
greater than 2.5 cm3. Mice challenged with H1975 cells
died from tumor burden or were killed when they reached
experimental end points. While mice treated with erlotinib
monotherapy survived significantly longer than DMSOtreated mice (P < 0.05), all mice eventually died (Fig.
7A). 3 out of 10 mice treated with the combination therapy
of G101348 and erlotinib were still alive without clinical
symptoms 76 days after treatment. Furthermore, all mice
survived significantly longer than mice treated with either
TG101348 or erlotinib as monotherapy (P < 0.01) (Fig.
7A). Our results suggest that the combined treatment can
prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing mice.
We evaluated the safety of combination treatment
of TG101348 and erlotinib in vivo by detecting the
pathologic alterations of four important organs from the
mice 5 weeks after the treatment. Histology analysis
showed that the tissues of heart, liver, lung and kidney
in all mice did not show obvious pathologic alterations 5
weeks after treatment (Fig. 7B). These results demonstrate
the safety of the combination treatment of TG101348 and

imatinib (ABL kinase inhibitor) inhibits cell proliferation
of BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia cells
[40]. We also found that TG101348 could sensitize EGFRmutant NSCLC cells to the cytotoxicity of erlotinib and
enhance erlotinib-induced apoptosis of erlotinib-resistant
NSCLC cells. Furthermore, the combination treatment
of TG101348 and erlotinib significantly inhibited tumor
growth of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells in vivo and

prolong survival time of tumor-bearing mice. These results
demonstrate for the first time that TG101348 enhances
the antitumor action of erlotinib in EGFR-mutant and
erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells. TG101348, therefore,
may be a potential agent for overcoming erlotinibresistance in treating NSCLC patients.

inhibitor of apoptosis family. Survivin overexpression
has been shown to be associated with tumor progression
and drug resistance [41]. Previous studies have shown
that PI3K-AKT activation of EGFR signaling upregulates
survivin expression, and persistent survivin expression is
associated with erlotinib-resistance in EGFR mutationpositive NSCLC cells [42]. Survivin inhibition results in
EGFR-TKI-induced apoptosis in EGFR mutation-positive
NSCLC cells [17]. In this study, erlotinib did not inhibit
survivin expression nor induce apoptosis in H1975 cells,
consistent with a previous report [17]. Our results showed
that TG101348 significantly inhibited survivin expression
and induced apoptosis in H1975 cells. Apoptosis-related
proteins bcl-2 family (e.g. Bcl-XL) and Inhibitor of
Apoptosis family (e.g. survivin) have also been shown
to be linked to erotinib-resistance of NSCLC cells [17].
Bcl-XL and survivin are downstream of both p-STAT3
signaling and EGFR. Thus, the combination of TG101348
and erlotinib markedly induced apoptosis and inhibited
survivin and Bcl-XL expression due to inhibition of the
activation of both STAT3 and EGFR. Consequently, the
combination of TG101348 and erlotinib resulted in the
increased induction of apoptosis. Our results are consistent
with a previous report that the inhibition of survivin
increased erlotinib-induced apoptosis in H1650 cells [17].
The results document that survivin inhibition is one of the
mechanisms by which TG101348 enhanced erlotinib antitumor effect.
In summary, our results indicate that TG101348
could reverse erlotinib resistance and significantly
enhance erlotinib-inhibited cell proliferation and erlotinibinduced apoptosis in erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells.
The inhibition of p-EGFR and p-STAT3 levels as well
as survivin expression are main mechanisms by which
TG101348 reverse erlotinib resistance in NSCLC cells.
Recently, a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial
showed that healthy volunteers were able to tolerate TG101348, which could inhibit p-STAT3 in human cells. [43].
Our findings suggest that TG101348 might be a potential
adjuvant for NSCLC patients during erlotinib treatment.

For generation of STAT3-knockdown stable cells, H1975
cells were infected with Lentivirus-STAT3-ShRNA
particles and Lentivirus-Ctrl-ShRNA particles (Santa
Cruz Biotech., Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Stable clones were
selected by puromycin and confirmed by Western blot.

Cell proliferation
Cell
proliferation
was
determined
by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, exponentially growing
NSCLC cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well
culture plates with 6 replicates. Twenty-four hours later
cells were treated with cisplatin, TG101348, erlotinib, or
the combination of TG101348 and erlotinib for another
72 hours. MTT (20 μl of 5 mg/ml) were added to each
well and incubated for 4 hours at 37˚C. Formazan crystals
were dissolved by adding 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). The color intensity, which is a reflection of the
number of live cells, was measured at a wavelength of 570
nm. Growth inhibition is expressed as the percentage of
surviving cells in drug-treated cells versus DMSO-treated
control cells. The IC50 value is the concentration resulting
in 50% cell growth inhibition by a 72 hours exposure to
drugs compared with control cells.

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was determined by a terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) assay
according to previous methods [44]. H1975 cells and
H1650 cells (1×105 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well
plates. Cells were treated with TG101348, erlotinib, or
the combination of TG101348 and erlotinib for 48 hours.
Cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour and
then penetrated with 0.1%Triton X-100 for 15 minutes.
TDT enzyme and label solution were added to the fixed
cells. After one hour, the cells were observed under a
fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan). The cells with
green nuclei staining were defined as apoptotic cells. The
apoptotic cells were assessed in 9 randomly selected fields
viewed at 200 × magnification. The apoptotic index was
calculated as total number of apoptotic cells in 9 view/total
number of nucleated cells ×100%.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
The NSCLC PC-9 (EGFR19del), H1650 cells (bearing
a deletion in exon 19 of the EGFR gene, i.e., DE746-A750,
EGFR19delE746-A750) and H1975 cells (EGFR L858R/T790M,
EGFRExon21L858R+T790M+ Exon20T790M) (ATCC, Rockville, MD,
USA) [31] were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100U/
ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco BRL,
Life Technologies, NY). TG101348 and erlotinib were
purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
NSCLC cells (1 x105) were cultured in 2 ml of
RPMI-1640 complete medium in a 6-well plate for 48
hours. Culture media were collected for ELISA. Human
IL-6 cytokines in the culture media were quantified using
anti-human IL-6 quantitative ELISA kits according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D, Minneapolis, MN

treatment, four important organs of heart, liver, lung and
kidney were harvested from the mice treated.

Western blot

Immunohistochemistry

Cancer cells treated with erlotinib and TG101348
were lysed with the lysis buffer [50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
250 mm NaCl, 0.1% NP40, and 5 mm EGTA containing
50 mm sodium fluoride, 60 mm β-glycerol-phosphate,
0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin].
Protein concentration was measured by using a BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
was used to separate proteins. The SDS-polyacrylamide
gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore,
Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with
specific primary antibodies against EGFR, phosphoEGFR (p-EGFR), STAT3, p-STAT3, Survivin, BclxL, Cleave caspase 3, XIAP, Bcl-2, and β-actin (Cell
Signaling Technology, San Diego, CA), and with HRPconjugated secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa
Fluor 680, or IRdye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals,
Inc. Gilbertsville, PA). The intensities of the protein bands
were scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska).

Tumor tissues were fixed in 10% formalin. Tumors
were embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E). The tissue sections were deparaffinized,
rehydrated and boiled in 0.01M sodium citrate for antigen
retrieval. The endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched. The sections were incubated with anti-cleavage
caspase 3 (cell signaling), anti-p-EGFR (1:250, abcam)
and anti-p-STAT3 (abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight
at 4°C. Tumor sections were incubated with biotinylated
secondary antibodies, streptavidin_biotin complex (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark). Staining was visualized using
diaminobenzidine. Representative photos were taken with
a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a Nikon
DXM1200 digital camera (Nikon instruments, Melville,
NY, USA). Cleavage caspase 3, p-EGFR and p-STAT3
staining were recorded as the ratio of positively stained
cells to all tumor cells at × 400 magnification.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the means ± SD. The statistical
significance of the difference between two groups was
evaluated with the Student’s t-test or one way variant
analysis (ANOVA) by using SPSS15.0 software. P < 0.05
was considered significant. The chi-square test was used to
analyze the difference in expression of genes samples. The
Kaplan–Meier method was used to analyze the survival
time of tumor-bearing mice.

Tumor xenograft mouse model
Four-week old female athymic nude mice were bred
in a sterilized animal room of the Animal Experimental
Centre of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences
(Shanghai, China). Animal protocols were approved by
Animal Care and Facilities Committee of the Second
Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. H1975 cells
(1 x106) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the
flanks of athymic nude mice. When tumor size reached
approximately 80 mm3 -100 mm3, mice were randomly
assigned to treatment and control groups, with each
group of 5 mice. TG101348 was dissolved in propylene
glycol, and erlotinib was prepared in drinking water. In the
treatment groups, mice received erlotinib (10 mg/kg body
weight) [18] and TG101348 (1g/kg body weight) [28] as
monotherapy or combination therapy by oral gavage daily
for 7 days. The control group received vehicle control.
Tumor sizes were measured by a caliper weekly. Five
weeks after the treatment, animals were euthanized, and
the weight of the tumor was measured. Tumor volume
(V) was calculated according to the following equation: V
(mm3) =1/2 a2b (a: relatively shorter diameter, b: relatively
longer diameter) [45]. To evaluate the survival time of the
xenografted mice, tumor-bearing mice were treated with
erlotinib (10 mg/kg body weight) and TG101348 (1g/kg
body weight) alone or their combination (10 mice/group)
as the same methods above. The end point was until
an entire group of mice died. To evaluate the safety of
