ABSTRACT:

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) axis regulates essential cellular functions including cell survival, proliferation,
metabolism, migration, and angiogenesis. The PI3K pathway is activated in human
cancers by mutation, amplification, and deletion of genes encoding components
of this pathway. The critical role of PI3K in cancer has led to the development of
drugs targeting the effector mechanisms of this signaling network. Recent studies
have shown that inhibition at multiple levels of the PI3K pathway results in FOXOdependent feedback reactivation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
which, in turn, limit the sustained inhibition of this pathway and attenuates the
action of therapeutic antagonists. This suggests that if used as single agents, PI3K
pathway inhibitors may have limited clinical activity. We propose herein that to
successfully target the output of the PI3K pathway in cancer cells, combination
therapies that hinder these compensatory mechanisms should be used. Thus,
combination therapies that target RTKs, PI3K, and mTOR activities may be required
to maximize the clinical benefit derived from treatment with these inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

Upon formation of PIP3, the pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain of AKT and PDK1 colocalize at the plasma
membrane, resulting in phosphorylation at T308 and
activation of AKT. Negative regulation of this pathway
is conferred by PTEN and INPP4B, which cleave a
phosphate group in PIP3 and PIP2, respectively. AKT
activates the mTOR-containing complex 1 (TORC1)
which, via S6K and 4E-BP1, regulates mRNA translation
and protein synthesis. mTOR is part of another complex
(TORC2), which phosphorlylates AKT at S473 and fully
induces its catalytic activity. Little is known about the
upstream activators of TORC2 although it is generally
thought that growth factors, directly or indirectly, control
its activity.
Class IA PI3K isoforms (PIK3Cα, PIK3Cβ, and
PIK3Cδ) are heterodimeric proteins that contain a p110
catalytic subunit and a p85 regulatory subunit. Three genes,
PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and PIK3CD, encode the homologous
p110α, p110β, and p110δ isozymes, respectively. p110α
and p110β are ubiquitously expressed whereas p110δ is

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway
is an important regulator in cell survival, proliferation, and
apoptosis. PI3K is a major signaling hub downstream of
HER2 and other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). PI3K
activates AKT, SGK, PDK1, mTOR, and several other
molecules involved in cell cycle progression and survival.
The PI3K pathway is one of the most frequently altered
networks in cancer [1], with mutation and/or amplification
of the genes encoding RTKs such as HER2 (ERBB2) and
FGFR1, the PI3K catalytic subunits p110α (PIK3CA)
and p110β (PIK3CB), the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α
(PIK3R1), the PI3K activator mutant K-RAS, the PI3K
effectors AKT1, AKT2, PDK1, and loss of the lipid
phosphatases PTEN and INPP4B. PI3K is activated by
growth factor RTKs and G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs). PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce the second messenger
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) [2, 3].

TORC2. Rodrik-Outmezguine et al. recently reported that
inhibition of TORC1/2 with the small molecule AZD8055
resulted in dephosphorylation of AKT at S473 and a rapid
but only transient inhibition of T308 P-AKT. Inhibition
of TORC1/2 also relieved feedback inhibition of RTKs
resulting in formation of PIP3 and rephosphorylation
of AKT at T308. Upon recovery of T308 P-AKT,
multiple AKT substrates, including FoxO, regained
phosphorylation, suggesting T308 P-AKT is catalytically
competent. This reinduction of T308 P-AKT and AKT
substrates was sensitive to inhibition of AKT but not
readdition of mTOR kinase inhibitors, thus demonstrating
that such reinduction results from hyperactivity of PI3K.
Finally, combined inhibition of mTOR kinase (TORC1/2)
and RTKs prevented the rebound of T308 P-AKT and
resulted in enhanced cell death and tumor regressions in
vivo [19].
Similar to the report using TORC1/2 inhibitors,
Chandarlapaty and colleagues showed that blockade of
AKT (upstream of TORC1 and downstream of TORC2)
with an allosteric kinase inhibitor also resulted in
enhanced transcription and phosphorylation of multiple
RTKs including HER3, IGF-1R, and insulin receptor
[20]. These changes are the result of both inhibition of
TORC1 and also derepression of FOXO-dependent
transcription. Like for rapalogs, inhibition at the level of
p110 also results in a compensatory activation of ERK
signaling [21]. The activation of HER (ErbB) receptors,
as indicated by increased expression of HER3 and binding
of adaptor molecules to phosphorylated HER2-HER3
dimers, collectively result in enhanced ERK signaling.
The combination of PI3K inhibitors with either HER2
or MEK inhibitors resulted in decreased proliferation,
enhanced cell death and superior anti-tumor activity in
vivo compared with single agent PI3K inhibitors.

largely limited to immune and hematopoietic cells. The
p110α isozyme is necessary for growth of tumors driven
by RTKs, mutant Ras, and/or PIK3CA mutations [4].
Conversely, p110β lies downstream of GPCR signaling
and ablation of p110β, but not that of p110α, impedes
tumorigenesis in PTEN-deficient cells [5]. PIK3CA
mutations are the most common genetic alterations of this
pathway in breast cancer, where ≥80% occur within “hot
spots” of exons 9 and 20, corresponding to the helical
(E542K and E545K) and kinase (H1047R) domains
of p110α. These mutations result in an enzyme with
increased catalytic activity through unique mechanisms
[6], but both induce similar features of transformation
including growth factor- and anchorage-independent
growth, and protection from anoikis [7].
The PI3K pathway and its upstream and downstream
effectors include many potential targets for drug
development in cancer. Drugs inhibiting this pathway
at different levels used alone or in combination with
chemotherapy, radiation, or other targeted therapies are
being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials and have
been summarized recently [8, 9]

INHIBITION OF THE P13K PATHWAY
RESULTS IN FEEDBACK REACTIVATION
OF MULTIPLE RTKS
Negative feedback regulation at different levels in
the PI3K pathway has been well-documented [10-12].
These feedback loops may have evolved in multicellular
organisms to manage growth and nutrient use by
individual cells with that of the whole organism [13]. One
of the first indications of negative-feedback regulation of
the pathway in cancer was found with rapamycin. The
macrolide rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs) complex
with FK506-binding protein (FKBP12); this complex then
binds to mTOR and, as a result, inhibits the kinase activity
of TORC1 but not TORC2. Inhibition of TORC1 and
downstream S6K with the rapalog everolimus derepresses
levels of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 expression
leading to activation of PI3K and phosphorylation of
AKT at S473 in both cancer cell lines and tumors of
patients [14-16]. These findings may explain the limited
clinical activity of TORC1 inhibitors when used as
single agents. This observation led to a phase I study of
a TORC1 inhibitor and an IGF-IR neutralizing antibody.
The combination of both drugs showed interesting clinical
activity in patients with luminal B metastatic breast cancer
[17]. Inhibition of mTORC1 was also shown to activate the
MAPK pathway [18]. In a study of patients treated with
the TORC1 inhibitor everolimus, tumors exhibited strong
upregulation of ERK phosphorylation. This feedback loop
was shown to depend on an S6K-PI3K-Ras pathway.
One approach to circumvent the feedback caused by
rapalogs is use of compounds that target the ATP-binding
cleft of mTOR and are thus active against both TORC1 and

INHIBITION OF P13K IS INCOMPLETE
WITH SINGLE AGENTS
Cancer cells that depend on the HER2 oncogene
rely heavily of PI3K activity [22, 23]. In these cells, PI3K
is activated by phosphorylated HER2-HER3 dimers.
Knockdown of HER3, the adaptor that directly binds PI3K
(p85) in these cells, inhibits PI3K and viability of HER2dependent breast cancer cells [24]. In a clinical trial where
patients with HER2+ breast cancer were treated with the
HER2 TKI lapatinib, there was significant upregulation of
HER3 protein without inhibition of S473-AKT in tumor
core biopsies obtained at 2 weeks of treatment [25, 26].
This result was somewhat surprising as tumors were
shrinking during therapy with the single agent TKI. The
rebound of HER3 protein levels was secondary to the
initial inhibition of PI3K-AKT and derepression of FoxOmediated HER3 mRNA transcription. Recovery of HER3
phosphorylation was secondary to residual HER2 kinase
activity and maintenance of ligand-independent HER21315

HER3 dimers. Inhibition of HER3 with either siRNA or
a neutralizing receptor antibody sensitized to lapatinib,
providing evidence that the upregulation of HER3 mRNA
and rebound phosphorylation of the HER3 RTK were
counteracting the full effect of lapatinib [25].
The data summarized above suggest that single
agent HER2 inhibitors cannot block completely the
signaling output from HER2 to HER3-PI3K-AKT. They
also suggest that surrogate markers of PI3K activity
would be valuable metrics to assess the magnitude of
therapeutic pharmacodynamic inhibition in tumors that
depend on oncogenes that activate and depend on PI3K.
Genes encoding most glycolytic enzymes are under
dominant transcriptional control by PI3K/AKT [27].
Further, activation of AKT stimulates glucose import and
metabolism [28]. Thus, a rapid decrease in [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)
uptake may represent a surrogate marker of inactivation
of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In a recent study, we treated
HER2+ BT474 xenografts with the combination of
lapatinib and U3-1287, a neutralizing HER3 monoclonal
antibody [29, 30]. To determine whether the combined
inhibition of HER2 and HER3 with lapatinib and U31287 improved the inhibition of PI3K over each single
agent, we used FDG-PET imaging. Baseline tumor [18F]
FDG uptake was measured; mice were then randomized
to control vehicle, lapatinib, U3-1287, or both drugs

combined and re-imaged on day 14. Treatment with the
combination resulted in a statistically significant decrease
in [18F]FDG tumor uptake compared to both vehicle- and
lapatinib-treated mice (Figure 1A and B). Treatment with
U3-1287 alone had no effect on [18F]FDG uptake (data not
shown). At 14 days of therapy there was no statistically
difference in tumor volume for any of the treatment groups
[25], suggesting that [18F]FDG uptake can be used as an
early imaging biomarker predictive of response to a PI3K
inhibitory therapy. Immunoblot analysis of tumor lysates
from tumors harvested at 28 days of treatment revealed
greater inhibition of P-AKT and P-Erk in xenografts
treated with the combination compared to xenografts
treated with lapatinib alone (Figure 1C). After 4 weeks of
therapy, tumors treated with the combination exhibited a
markedly reduced volume compared to the lapatinib and
control arms [25]. These results suggest that a single-agent
inhibitor is ineffective at completely blocking the PI3K
pathway and that combination approaches are needed
to block feedback-regulated pathways thus completing
blockade of the PI3K axis.
In a second example, we reported that treatment with
the pan-PI3K inhibitor XL-147 (Exelixis) was followed
by up-regulation of expression and phosphorylation of
several RTKs, including HER3, InsR, IGF-1R, FGFR2/3
[31]. Knockdown of FoxO1 and FoxO3a transcription
factors suppressed the induction of HER3, InsR, IGF-1R,

Figure 1: Inhibition of HER3 sensitizes cells to the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib in vivo. Female athymic mice were injected with

BT474 cells as described [25]. Once tumors reached a volume ≥250 mm3, mice were randomized to 1) 20 mg/kg normal human IgG i.p.
twice a week and vehicle daily via orogastric gavage (control), 2) lapatinib (100 mg/kg daily via orogastric gavage), 3) U3-1287 (20 mg/
kg i.p. twice a week), or 4) a combination of lapatinib and U3-1287. Treatment was administered for 4 weeks. (A,B). Tumor-bearing mice
were imaged at baseline for [18F]FDG uptake, treated as described above and re-imaged on day 14 (n=8-11 per group). (A). Images from a

and FGFR2 mRNAs upon inhibition of PI3K. In HER2+
cells, HER3 was the main RTK that became reactivated
upon treatment with XL-147. Further, addition of
lapatinib or the HER2 antibody trastuzumab to XL-147 in
mice with established BT474 xenografts resulted in better
growth inhibition as well as reduction of tumor levels of
P-HER3, P-AKT, and P-S6.
T the biologically relevant RTKs that compensate for
inhibition of PI3K-AKT in cancers expressing low levels
of HER2 are less clear. We have examined this question
in ER+/HER2-negative MCF7 human breast cancer
cells which also harbor an activating E545K mutation in
PIK3CA (p110α) [32]. In these cells, treatment with the
pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 [33] over a time-course was
followed by upregulation of total and phosphorylated InsR
at 24 h (Figure 2A,B). The compensatory upregulation
of total and P-InsR upon inhibition of PI3K suggested
that combined inhibition of InsR and PI3K would
synergistically inhibit tumor cell viability. Therefore, we
transfected MCF7 cells with InsR siRNA oligonucleotides
in combination with BKM120. The combination of InsR

knockdown and BKM120 resulted in a statistical reduction
in cell growth compared to either treatment alone. This was
further confirmed by immunoblot of PARP, a biomarker
of cell death (Figure 2C). These data further suggest that
upon inhibition of PI3K, PI3K-dependent cells upregulate
RTKs that hamper the efficacy of a single-agent PI3K
pathway inhibitor. Taken together, the findings presented
here and elsewhere [14, 18-21, 25, 31] reveal a complex
network of feedback regulation between PI3K, mTOR,
and RTKs.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
These findings have obvious translational
implications for the treatment of PI3K-pathway dependent
cancers. The relief of negative feedback loops upon
inhibition of different levels in the PI3K-AKT pathway
and subsequent reactivation of RTKs suggest that, if used
as single agents, PI3K inhibitors will have suboptimal
clinical activity. It is possible that relief of these feedback

loops is also occurring in non-tumor host tissues and thus
ameliorating drug-related toxicities. Combined targeting
of different levels of the PI3K pathway, i.e., TORC1/2 and
p110, RTK and p110; RTK and TORC1/2, etc., in order to
more completely suppress its signaling output, have not
been fully explored. Whether those combined approaches
limit feedback reactivation and, as a result, block the
pathway more strongly and/or whether they are clinically
well tolerated and feasible remains to be determined.
Compensatory feedback may not be limited to RTKs.
For example, inhibition of PI3K in prostate cancer cells
activates signaling by the androgen receptor (AR) and
inhibition of the AR, in turn, activates AKT signaling
by reducing levels of the AKT phosphatase PHLPP [34].
Whether similar coordinate regulation of steroid receptors
exists in other hormone-dependent tumors remains to
be established. Interestingly, however, experimental and
clinical evidence suggests that hyperactivation of the PI3K
pathway promotes antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer
[35], suggesting that simultaneous targeting of PI3K and
ER pathways may be effective in ER+ breast cancer [36].
The ability of these combinations to perform in the clinic
is currently the focus of active investigation. Ideally, these
studies should confirm whether the feedback reactivation
seen in the laboratory in cancer cells following PI3KAKT inhibition is of the same nature in primary tumors.
