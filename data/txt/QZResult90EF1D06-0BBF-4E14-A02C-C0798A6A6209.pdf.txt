ABSTRACT
Cisplatin is one of the most common chemotherapeutic drugs for non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the response rate is limited because of drug
resistance. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), which can alter DNA accessibility
by regulating chromatin structure and inducing apoptosis, exhibit a synergistic action
with cisplatin. However, no biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of the combination
of HDACis and cisplatin have been reported. Our study found that panobinostat, an
HDAC inhibitor, increased the cisplatin sensitivity of several NSCLC cell lines with low
ERCC1 expression but not those with high ERCC1 expression or gain-of-function (GOF)
p53 mutation despite of ERCC1 expression level. ERCC1 knockdown increased the
cisplatin sensitivity of NSCLC cell lines with high ERCC1 expression without GOF p53
mutations. In addition, in low ERCC1 expression NSCLC cell lines, knockdown of GOF
mutant p53 enhanced cisplatin sensitivity. Further double knockdown of ERCC1 and
GOF mutant p53 but not ERCC1 knockdown alone increased the cisplatin sensitivity
of cells with both high ERCC1 expression and GOF p53 mutations. Therefore, this
study demonstrated that ERCC1 expression combined with p53 mutation status
may determine the efficacy of cisplatin and HDACi combined therapy and guide the
development of future NSCLC therapies.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death
worldwide and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
accounts for more than 85% of all lung cancer cases
[1]. Although significant progress has been made in
lung cancer treatment over the last 10 years, platinumbased chemotherapy is still the most common treatment.
However, because primary and acquired drug resistance
limit chemotherapy’s efficacy, only approximately 16%
of all lung cancer patients live for 5 years or more after
diagnosis [2]. Therefore, new approaches to enhance
sensitivity and reverse drug resistance in cancer treatment
are urgently needed.
Epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation,
mRNA regulation and other posttranslational changes
in chromatin have emerged as novel targets in cancer
treatment. Among them, the balance between histone
transacetylases and deacetylases, which mediate the
expression of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, makes
these enzymes promising therapeutic targets [3]. Previous
studies have shown that histone deacetylases (HDACs) are
important for gene expression because HDAC levels vary
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in different cancer types, and promising results with HDAC
inhibitors (HDACis) combined with chemotherapeutic
drugs in cancer treatment have been reported [4, 5]. Two
HDACis, vorinostat [6] and romidepsin  [7], have been
approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma (CTLC), and another HDACi, istodax,
has been approved for the treatment of peripheral T-cell
lymphoma over the last ten years [7].
The antitumor mechanisms of HDACis primarily
include altering DNA accessibility by regulating
chromatin structure and inducing apoptosis by
up-regulating acetylated p53 and p21 [8, 9]. Panobinostat,
an HDACi in the hydroxamate family, has been shown in
phase I clinical trials to be effective against leukemia and
solid tumors, and it is currently being investigated in phase
II and III clinical trials [10–12]. Panobinostat also has
been confirmed to have a synergistic effect with cisplatin
by many preclinical studies [13–17].

DNA repair capacity and clinical drug resistance,
especially cisplatin resistance [18]. Wild-type p53 is
required for the induction of apoptotic cell death by certain
antitumor drugs, such as HDACis and anthracycline
[19, 20]. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether
ERCC1 and p53, both of which are important biomarkers
related to drug sensitivity, have predictive roles for the
efficacy of combined panobinostat and cisplatin treatment.
In addition, we also sought to elucidate the mechanisms of
ERCC1 and p53 in determining the sensitivity of NSCLC
cell lines to panobinostat and cisplatin.

cell line, and PC14 was classified as a ERCC1High/p53GOF
cell line. The information on the 8 cell lines is listed in
abbreviated form based on ERCC1 expression level and
p53 status in Supplementary Table S1.
Next, we examined the cisplatin sensitivity of the
NSCLC cells. We treated all 8 cell lines with different
doses of cisplatin from 0 to 100 μM for 48 hours, and cell
proliferation was measured using Cell Titer-Glo. As shown in
Fig. 1C, A549 cells were the most sensitive to cisplatin, with
an IC50 of approximately 12 μM. However, the other 7 cell
lines all exhibited resistance to cisplatin independent of their
ERCC1 expression level. The IC50 of these 7 lines was higher
than 50 μM. There was no obvious relationship between
ERCC1 expression and the effect of cisplatin in these cells.

cell lines and their sensitivity to cisplatin

Effect of panobinostat on the 8 NSCLC cell lines
Panobinostat was selected to treat the NSCLC
cells because of its high potency. In our previous study,
panobinostat itself did not kill tumor cells but sensitized
cisplatin below 20 nM after 48 hours of treatment (data
not shown). Here, we treated the NSCLC cells with
panobinostat at 10 nM. After 48 hours of treatment, cell
viability was measured, and 10 nM panobinostat had a
less than 5% inhibition rate in all cancer cell lines (Fig. 2A).

First, we examined the expression levels of ERCC1
in 8 NSCLS cell lines: A549, PC14, NCI-H23, HCI-H441,
HCC827, NCI-H1299, NCI-H1975 and NCI-H2172.
ERCC1 expression in these cell lines was analyzed by
reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR (Fig. 1A) and western
blot (Fig. 1B) assays. We found high ERCC1 expression
levels in PC14, H1299 and H2172 cells and low levels
in the other 5 cell lines. The p53 status of these cell lines
was also investigated. Then, we classified these 8 cell
lines into different categories according to their ERCC1
level and p53 status. A549 and H827 were classified as
ERCC1Low/p53WT cell lines. H23 and H441, which harbor
non-gain-of-function (GOF) p53 mutations, were classified
as ERCC1Low/p53MU cell lines. H1299 and H2172, which do
not express p53, were classified as ERCC1High/p53Null cell
lines. Similarly, H1975 was classified as a ERCC1Low/p53GOF

with cisplatin at different doses from 0 to 100 μM to treat
all 8 cell lines for 48 hours. In H827 (Fig. 2B, left panel)

ERCC1Low/p53WT, as well as in H23 (Fig. 2B, right panel)
and H441 (Supplementary Fig. S1B) cells, which are
ERCC1Low/p53MU cell lines, panobinostat significantly
improved the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. However, no
such effect was observed in the other 4 cell lines:
H1299 (Fig. 2C) and H2172 (Supplementary Fig. S1C)
cells, which are ERCC1High/p53Null cell lines, or in PC14
(Fig.  2D) and H1975 (Supplementary Fig. S1D) cells,
which are p53GOF cell lines. Three of the four resistant cell
lines exhibited high ERCC1 expression, while all 4 of the
sensitive cell lines had low ERCC1 expression levels. The
results suggest that the ERCC1 expression level can be
considered a predictive marker of resistance to cisplatin
combined with panobinostat.

to examine cell growth after ERCC1 knockdown (KD)
in the setting of cisplatin and panobinostat treatment.
H2172 (Fig. 3B) and H1299 (Supplementary Fig. S2A)
cells became more sensitive to combination treatment
after ERCC1 KD. However, we did not observe this
effect in PC14 cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the ERCC1Low
H827 and H23 cell lines, which were sensitive to
the panobinostat and cisplatin combination therapy,
became resistant to combination treatment after ERCC1
over-expression (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S2B).
These results suggest that the ERCC1 expression
level affects the sensitivity of most cells to cisplatin
combined with panobinostat.

ERCC1 knockdown or over-expression

panobinostat in NSCLC cell lines

To further understand the mechanism of
panobinostat sensitization to cisplatin, we examined the
p53 pathway and apoptosis in the cell lines. H1299 and
H2172, which are p53Null cells, showed no p53 expression
on our western blots, even after exposure to doxorubicin,
which is known to be a strong p53-induction compound.
We used A549 cells as a positive control to show p53
expression (Fig. 4A). Thus, we performed the p53-related
apoptosis assays in the other cell lines. Phospho-p53 (S15)
was found to be induced in all 5 of the cell lines analyzed
(Fig. 4B). However, the induction of p21 (Fig. 4C) and
cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) (Fig. 4D)

Next, we sought to determine whether cell
sensitivity to cisplatin and panobinostat was dependent
on ERCC1 expression levels. First, we transfected two
individual siRNAs that had been reported previously
[21, 22] into PC-14, H1299 and H2172 cells, which are
all ERCC1High cell lines. We examined ERCC1 mRNA
levels using RT-qPCR after siRNA transfection. Both
siRNAs knocked down ERCC1 mRNA expression to
levels lower than 50% (Fig. 3A). Then, we chose siRNA-1

enhancing drug sensitivity, reversing drug resistance and
prolonging the time to drug resistance are very important
research goals.
Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic drug that binds to
and crosslinks DNA, leading to the induction of cancer cell
apoptosis. The anticancer effect of cisplatin is increased
by HDACis, and the underlying mechanisms have been
investigated since 2003. Many mechanisms contribute to
the synergistic effect of combined treatment [21, 23–26].
Among them, the chromatin structure alterations induced
by HDACis, which make DNA double strands more
accessible to covalent modification by cisplatin, appear to
be the major mechanism responsible for sensitizing cancer
cells to cisplatin. It has been reported that combination of
cisplatin and panobinostat can overcome hypoxia-induced
cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells [15].
Furthermore, some studies have found that upregulation of apoptotic proteins such as p53, Bim and
caspase 3 and down-regulation of glutathione (GSH)
enhance cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Since vorinostat and
romidepsin were approved for use in cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma (CTLC) by the US FDA, several similar drugs
have been evaluated in NSCLC treatment in recent years
[27]. For example, entinostat and chidamide have entered
phase II clinical trials, and vorinostat and panobinostat
have been studied in phase III clinical trials [10, 11].
The identification of biomarkers is one of the most
important aspects of studying a new therapeutic class.
It is necessary to identify which patients may benefit
from a particular therapy. However, to date, predictable
biomarkers for selecting patients or predicting responses
to HDACi treatment remain undetermined. Some studies
have reported that histone 3 and 4 hyperacetylation
(because an accumulation of acetylated histones is a
direct downstream consequence of HDAC inhibition) and
HR23B (a protein that transports ubiquitinated cargo to
proteasomes) are biomarkers for sensitivity to HDACiinduced apoptosis [28, 29]. However, those biomarkers
are not yet widely used, and their reliability in clinical
practice remains to be confirmed. Here, we investigated
the predictive role of two classical and readily assayable
biomarkers, ERCC1 and p53, which are involved in the
underlying mechanisms of NSCLC cell treatment with a
combination of HDACis and cisplatin.
Although the association between cisplatin
sensitivity and ERCC1 expression level was not as strong
in our eight NSCLC cell lines as in previous reports,
the present study found that ERCC1 expression had a
very clear predictive role with regard to the efficacy of
panobinostat and cisplatin combination therapy. Notably,
we used 10 nM panobinostat, which is a concentration that
is not typically employed in cancer treatment but is used as
a sensitizer to cisplatin to avoid the toxicity of non-specific
HDACis. Improved cytotoxicity was only observed in the
four NSCLC cell lines with low ERCC1 expression, with

PC14 and H1975 cells have been reported to harbor
GOF p53 mutations, specifically the R248Q mutation
in PC14 cells and the R273H mutation in H1975 cells.
To investigate whether GOF p53 mutations play a role
in chemo-resistance, we knocked down p53 expression
in H1975 and PC14 cells as well as in H827 cells as a
wild-type p53 control. We validated the KD efficiency
of the p53 shRNAs using RT-qPCR and western blot
(Fig. 5A). ERCC1 expression levels did not change with
p53 KD (Supplementary Fig S4A). Based on the results,
p53-sh3 and p53-sh4 showed good KD efficiency. We
chose p53-sh4 to examine cell proliferation in response
to the combination treatment in the context of p53
KD. In A549 (ERCC1Low/p53WT) cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4B) and NCI-H441 (ERCC1Low/p53MU) cells
(Supplementary  Fig. S4C), p53 KD did not cause any
change in cell sensitivity to cisplatin combined with
panobinostat. In contrast, H1975 (ERCC1Low/p53GOF)
cells (Fig. 5B) showed significantly increased sensitivity
to cisplatin combined with panobinostat after GOF p53
KD. Flow cytometry also showed increased apoptosis in
H1975 cells after p53 KD (Fig. 5D). However, we still
did not observe a significant change in the sensitivity
of PC14 cells (Fig.  5C). Considering the high level of
ERCC1 expression in PC14 cells, next we performed
ERCC1 and p53 double KD in PC14 cells. Cell
proliferation (Fig.  5C)  and flow cytometry (Fig.  5D)
both showed that  the combination of  panobinostat and
cisplatin could inhibit cell growth and increase apoptosis
in PC14 cells.
To further confirm the contribution of p53 to
sensitivity to combined treatment, we over-expressed
wild-type p53 in H2172 (ERCC1High/p53Null) cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4D). The cells were then treated
with cisplatin and panobinostat. Wild-type p53-transfected
H2172 cells showed increased sensitivity to combined
treatment. These results suggest that wild-type p53
contributes to cell sensitivity to combination cisplatin
and panobinostat treatment and that GOF p53 mutations
increase cell resistance to the treatment.

DISCUSSION
Many novel drugs, such as anti-angiogenesis
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), molecular tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors have
emerged in NSCLC treatment over the last 10 years.
However, platinum-based regimens are still preferred in
NSCLC adjuvant treatment and are first-line therapy in
advanced NSCLC. Almost all regimens eventually fail
due to the development of drug resistance. Therefore,

the exception of the H1975 cell line, which also contains
a GOF p53 mutation. None of the other three cell lines
with high ERCC1 expression levels showed increased
sensitivity to panobinostat and cisplatin combination
treatment. Next, we knocked down ERCC1 in these three
cell lines with high ERCC1 expression. The two p53Null
cell lines but not PC14 (ERCC1High/p53GOF) became
sensitive to cisplatin and panobinostat combination
treatment. These results indicated that ERCC1 can be used
as an effective biomarker for combination therapy with
HDACis and cisplatin, and the mechanism may be related
to the DNA repair capability determined by the ERCC1
level. However, the data also implied that GOF p53

mutations might contribute to resistance to panobinostat
and cisplatin combination treatment.
Our above results suggest that p53 mutation status
is very important in the response of NSCLC cell lines to
panobinostat and cisplatin combination treatment. It has
also been reported that GOF mutant p53 can lead to drug
resistance by inhibiting cancer cell apoptosis [30, 31].
Thus, we further investigated the association between p53
status and drug resistance. We used shRNA to knock down
the expression of GOF mutant p53 in H1975 (ERCC1Low/
p53GOF) and PC14 (ERCC1High/p53GOF) cell lines. After KD
of GOF mutant p53, the H1975 cells became sensitive,
whereas the PC14 cells remained resistant to cisplatin

and panobinostat combination treatment. However, it
is very interesting that double KD of ERCC1 and GOF
mutant p53 in the PC14 cell line significantly increased
the sensitivity to combination panobinostat and cisplatin
treatment. These results demonstrated that GOF p53
mutation as well as a high ERCC1 expression level plays
important roles in the resistance of NSCLC cell lines
to panobinostat and cisplatin combination treatment.
Therefore, based on these findings, combined screening
for GOF p53 mutations and ERCC1 expression level
could be more valuable than either individual biomarker
in predicting the efficacy of panobinostat and cisplatin
combination treatment.
HDACis not only loosen the structure of
chromosomes to allow DNA-damaging drugs such as
cisplatin to come into contact with the DNA strands more
easily, but they also up-regulate apoptotic proteins such
as p53 and p21. Our western blotting showed that the
p21 and PARP levels were increased in the two p53WT
and the two p53MU cell lines, which all showed increased
sensitivity to combination treatment. However, in the two
p53GOF cell lines (H1975 and PC14) that were still resistant
to combination treatment, no p21 or PARP was induced.
Our study indicated that HDACis could significantly
improve the cytotoxicity of cisplatin only in low ERCC1expressing NSCLC cell lines without GOF p53 mutations
based not only on chromatin structure alterations but also
on p53-induced cell apoptosis. We confirmed that high
expression levels of ERCC1 and GOF p53 mutants can
contribute to the resistance of NSCLC cell lines to the
above treatment, and combined screening for these two
biomarkers might have great potential value in future
clinical practice.
