Author Manuscript

Targeting HER2 with antibodies or small molecule inhibitors in HER2-positive breast cancer
leads to improved survival, but resistance is a common clinical problem. To uncover novel
mechanisms of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer, we performed a kinase open
reading frame (ORF) screen to identify genes that rescue HER2-amplified breast cancer cells from
HER2 inhibition or suppression. In addition to multiple members of the MAPK and PI3K
signaling pathways, we discovered that expression of the survival kinases PRKACA and PIM1
rescued cells from anti-HER2 therapy. Furthermore, we observed elevated PRKACA expression
in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer samples, indicating that this pathway is activated in breast
cancers that are clinically resistant to trastuzumab-containing therapy. We found that neither
PRKACA nor PIM1 restored MAPK or PI3K activation after lapatinib or trastuzumab treatment,
but rather inactivated the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, thereby permitting survival signaling
through BCL-XL. Pharmacological blockade of BCL-XL/BCL-2 partially abrogated the rescue
effects conferred by PRKACA and PIM1, and sensitized cells to lapatinib treatment. These
observations suggest that combined targeting of HER2 and the BCL-XL/BCL-2 anti-apoptotic
pathway may increase responses to anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer and decrease the
emergence of resistant disease.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

The receptor tyrosine kinase HER2 is amplified and/or overexpressed in 20–30% of all
breast cancers (1, 2), leading to constitutive proliferative and survival signaling via the
downstream Ras/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways. Amplification or overexpression of HER2 is
associated with poor prognosis, and perturbation of HER2 signaling with trastuzumab or
lapatinib has led to clinical benefit in HER2-positive breast cancer patients (3–7). However,
many patients with early-stage disease experience tumor recurrence despite adjuvant
treatment with trastuzumab, and patients with metastatic disease inevitably develop
resistance to anti-HER2 therapies.

Author Manuscript

For trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of HER2, a
number of potential mechanisms of resistance have been identified. These include cleavage
of the extracellular domain of HER2, as well as heterodimerization with HER3 or IGF1R;
both of these mechanisms result in continued downstream MAPK and PI3K signaling (8–
10). Resistance also has been shown to occur in the setting of PTEN loss, activating PIK3CA
mutations, CCNE amplification, or c-SRC activation (11–17). Resistance to lapatinib, which
inhibits intracellular tyrosine kinase activity, can be induced in HER2-amplified breast
cancer cells by activating PIK3CA mutations, loss of PTEN (18), or by activation of
mTORC1 (19). Since clinically resistant breast cancer samples have not been extensively
molecularly characterized, due in part to limited sample availability, the extent to which
each of these molecular mechanisms contributes to resistance in HER2-positive human
breast cancers is largely unknown.
Although strategies to target the MAPK and PI3K pathways in resistant cancers are being
pursued, these mechanisms likely fail to account for the development of resistant disease in
all patients. Hence we conducted an unbiased screen to determine whether pathways other
than those directly downstream of canonical HER2 signaling might also confer resistance.
Here we describe a systematic interrogation of resistance mechanisms to suppression of
HER2 to identify the major mechanisms of resistance to HER2-directed therapy.

RESULTS
Author Manuscript

We conducted two kinome ORF screens in parallel to identify genes that confer resistance to
the lapatinib-like dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor AEE788 and to suppression of HER2 with a
short hairpin RNA (shRNA). We reasoned that the “off-target” effects of a small molecule
inhibitor and an shRNA should be different, such that the intersection of hits from both
screens would help to identify biological pathways that can confer resistance to anti-HER2
therapy. We tested six independent anti-HER2 shRNAs in BT474 cells and found that there
was a strong correlation between the degree of HER2 protein suppression and loss of
viability/proliferation. We chose the most effective shRNA, sh4355, for the screen (Fig.
S1A). We titrated the AEE788 dose in BT474 cells, and selected 0.85 µM for the screen

because it reduced cell viability to approximately 40% that of control, allowing a sufficient
window for rescue to be detected (Fig. S1B).

Author Manuscript

We then used the Broad Institute/Center for Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB) V5 epitopetagged kinase ORF collection to identify genes that mediate resistance to these
manipulations (20) (Fig. S2). Of the 597 ORFs, 14 scored more than two standard deviations
(SD) above the median of all ORFs in the AEE788 screen, and 20 did so in the shRNA
screen (Table 1 and Fig. 1A). Seven genes scored in both screens, including the activated
forms of HRAS, KRAS, and MEK, which were screened as positive controls because they
are known to signal downstream of HER2. AKT1, which signals downstream of HER2 to
promote survival, scored strongly in both screens. In addition, MAP2K6, CRKL, and AKT3,
which are known to signal through the Ras-ERK pathway or the PI3K-AKT pathway, scored
more than two SD above the median in the shHER2 screen and more than 1.5 SD above the
median in the AEE788 screen. These observations confirm prior work implicating MAPK
and PI3K signaling as a major mechanism of resistance to HER2 inhibition (9–12, 21).
Three genes that have not been previously described as downstream targets of HER2
signaling scored more than 2 SD above the median in both screens: PRKACA, PIM1, and
PIM2. In validation studies we found that, of these three molecules, PRKACA expression
rescued BT474 cells most strongly from lapatinib, although PIM1 and PIM2 were expressed
at much lower levels in these experiments (Fig. S3).

Author Manuscript

PRKACA is the alpha catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-activated Protein Kinase A
(PKA), whose activity is inhibited by PKA regulatory subunits. The second messenger
cAMP activates PKA by causing the release of PRKACA or PRKACB from the regulatory
subunits. Myriad effects of PKA activation have been described, including promotion of
survival signaling. In addition, Vegran and colleagues demonstrated that PRKACA was one
of 16 upregulated genes within a transcriptional signature that distinguishes breast cancers
that failed to achieve a pathological complete remission (pCR) after trastuzumab plus
docetaxel neoadjuvant chemotherapy from those that did achieve a pCR (22).

Author Manuscript

We validated our findings by performing dose titration curves for lapatinib in the setting of
ectopic PRKACA expression in three HER2-amplified breast cancer cell lines. PRKACA
expression increased the viability of BT474, SKBr3, and ZR-75-30 cells propagated in the
presence of lapatinib (Fig. 1B). PRKACA expression also increased the viability of
trastuzumab-treated HER2-amplified cells (Fig. S4). By counting viable cells, we found that
lapatinib treatment of control cells expressing LACZ resulted in cell death, whereas
overexpression of PRKACA in BT474 cells prevented cell death but failed to restore
proliferation (Fig. 1C). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that PRKACA
expression interferes with lapatinib-induced apoptosis. We found that, indeed, lapatinib
treatment induced caspase 3/7 cleavage, and this event was significantly reduced by
PRKACA overexpression (Fig. 1D, LACZ vs. PRKACA, p = 0.0003 for ZR-75-30, p =
0.0002 for BT474). These findings indicate that PRKACA rescues HER2-amplified cells
from lapatinib treatment at least in part through the restoration of anti-apoptotic survival
signaling.

We then investigated mechanism(s) by which PRKACA conferred resistance to trastuzumab
and lapatinib treatment. Since HER2 is thought to signal primarily through the Ras/Raf/
MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, we first examined the activation of these pathways in the
presence of AEE788 or lapatinib in BT474 cells transduced with a control ORF, LACZ. As
expected, both p-ERK and p-AKT levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner in these
cells in response to AEE788 and lapatinib (Fig. 2A). Transduction of HRASV12 into
BT474s prior to treatment with either inhibitor completely restored p-ERK levels at all doses
examined, but only partially restored p-AKT levels in the setting of AEE788 treatment and
had no effect at the doses of lapatinib tested. These observations may be the result of the
failure of Ras signaling to fully restore HER2-mediated, Ras-independent PI3K activation
(Fig. 2A)(23). By contrast, expression of PRKACA failed to restore p-AKT or p-ERK levels
in the context of either drug (Fig. 2B). Although we noted a slight decrease in baseline pERK levels in BT474 cells in the context of ectopic PRKACA expression, we were unable
to verify this finding in the other cell lines tested (Fig. 2D); it is therefore possible that a
feedback mechanism is operative in BT474 cells that results in a small decrease in MAPK
signaling when PRKACA is overexpressed, but which does not lead to a significant decrease
in proliferation (Fig. 1C). These observations suggested that PRKACA rescues cells from
HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibition by a mechanism that is not mediated by AKT or ERK
activation.

PRKACA has previously been reported to phosphorylate β-catenin, resulting in its
activation, as well as BAD, resulting in its inactivation (24–27). BAD phosphorylation,
which is also mediated by AKT, prevents the inhibitory influence of BAD on BCL-2 and
BCL-XL, thereby promoting the anti-apoptotic activities of these molecules (28). PRKACA
has also been reported to phosphorylate and inactivate GSK3-beta, which could lead to
increased β-catenin activation (29). We therefore investigated the phosphorylation status of
β-catenin, BAD, and GSK3 in PRKACA-overexpressing cells in the context of trastuzumab
or lapatinib treatment. We found that phosphorylation of BAD at ser112 and ser136 was
strikingly diminished by lapatinib treatment, and was also inhibited by trastuzumab
treatment (Fig. 2C). In contrast, exposure to lapatinib or trastuzumab failed to affect the
phosphorylation of β-catenin or GSK3-beta (Fig. 2C). Similarly, phosphorylation of a
canonical downstream target of PKA, CREB, and its closely related family member, ATF1,
were increased as expected by PRKACA overexpression, but were not decreased by
exposure to lapatinib or AEE788 (Fig. 2C). Phosphorylation of BAD at ser112 and ser136 in
the setting of lapatinib treatment was fully restored by PRKACA expression in BT474,
SKBr3, and ZR-75-30 cells (Fig. 2C, 2D). In consonance with the observation in BT474
cells that PRKACA did not restore MAPK or PI3K signaling in the context of lapatinib
treatment, PRKACA expression in SKBr3 or ZR-75-30 cells failed to restore
phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, mTOR, and p70-S6K (Fig. 2D). These observations suggest
that lapatinib and trastuzumab exert some of their inhibitory effects on HER2-positive cells
through BAD de-phosphorylation, likely as a result of AKT inactivation, and that PRKACA
overexpression rescues these cells in part through BAD re-phosphorylation and inactivation.
We next examined whether the kinase activity of PRKACA was required for the observed
phenotypes of lapatinib resistance and BAD phosphorylation. Expression of a kinase-dead
PRKACA mutant (K72H, PRKACA-KD) (30) failed to rescue ZR-75-30 or SKBr3 cells

from lapatinib treatment, whereas both a V5-tagged and untagged (closed) version of
PRKACA-WT conferred robust rescue (Fig. 3A). In addition, PRKACA-KD failed to
restore BAD phosphorylation, indicating that the kinase activity of PRKACA is required for
this effect (Fig 3B). Moreover, PRKACA-WT levels, which were higher in the V5-tagged
construct than in the closed construct, positively correlated with the extent of rescue from
lapatinib, as well as with the extent of BAD phosphorylation observed (Fig. 3A, 3B). These
findings confirm that the kinase activity of PRKACA is required for the observed
phenotypes of rescue from lapatinib and of BAD phosphorylation.

Author Manuscript

To confirm that the phenotypes observed with exogenous PRKACA expression also occur
upon activation of endogenous PRKACA, we conducted an experiment using forskolin to
activate cyclic AMP, which in turn activates PRKACA. Forskolin pre-treatment of
ZR-75-30 cells resulted in resistance to lapatinib treatment (Fig. S5A) as well as restoration
of inactivating BAD phosphorylation (Fig. S5B). These results demonstrate that the
phenotypes observed can be achieved by activation of physiologic levels of endogenous
PRKACA.

Since we found that high levels of PRKACA expression conferred resistance to lapatinib
and trastuzumab treatment, we wished to determine whether PRKACA is overexpressed in
the setting of acquired resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in human breast cancer samples. To
examine this question, we performed PRKACA immunohistochemistry on breast cancer
samples taken from patients prior to the administration of anti-HER2 therapy and after the
development of clinical resistance to trastuzumab-containing therapy. In three of five cases
we found dramatically increased PRKACA expression in the clinically resistant sample as
compared to the pre-treatment sample (Fig. 3C). Specifically, patient #1 was diagnosed with
de novo HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, confirmed by biopsy of a sternal lesion
(Fig. 3C, panel a). She initially responded to trastuzumab-containing therapy for 17 months,
but then developed clinical resistance and progression in her breast lesion while other areas
of disease remained stable. At that time she underwent a mastectomy for local disease
control (Fig. 3C, panel b). Patient #2 was diagnosed with early stage HER2-positive breast
cancer, treated with lumpectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, and radiation. Twelve
years later she experienced a recurrence in the same breast and the contralateral axilla (Fig.
3C, panel c, breast biopsy is shown). She then received a total of 24 months of trastuzumabbased treatment, with good response initially but with subsequent progression in the axilla
only, which was resected at that time (Fig. 3C, panel d). Patient #3 was diagnosed with de
novo metastatic breast cancer, confirmed by fine needle aspirate of a liver lesion. A biopsy
of her breast cancer at diagnosis is shown (Fig. 3C, panel e). She was treated with
trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, with an excellent response in both the breast and liver lesions.
However, after nine months of treatment her breast lesion was clearly growing while her
distant metastatic disease continued to respond to therapy. She therefore underwent
mastectomy for local disease control (Fig. 3C, panel f). In each of these cases, the level of
PRKACA in the epithelial tumor cells was strikingly higher in the clinically resistant sample
than in the pre-treatment sample, which had demonstrated response to trastuzumab-based
therapy. Together with our functional data demonstrating that PRKACA confers resistance
to trastuzumab and lapatinib in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells, these observations

strongly suggest that PRKACA overexpression contributes to trastuzumab resistance in a
subset of human breast cancers.
The two samples that did not clearly demonstrate an increase in PRKACA expression in the
post-treatment sample differed from the other three in that the pre-treatment sample was
obtained from early stage disease which was completely resected (Fig. S6, panels a and c).
No sample from the time of metastatic diagnosis was available for testing, so the level of
PRKACA initially present in the metastatic disease is unknown. These patients received
trastuzumab and/or lapatinib-based treatment in the metastatic setting, and were biopsied at
a later point of progression (Fig. S6, panels b and d). PRKACA expression was low to
moderate in these samples, suggesting that a different mechanism of resistance may have
been operative in these cases.

Author Manuscript

Given the high PRKACA expression observed in several of the samples analyzed, we
wished to examine a larger panel of breast cancers for PRKACA expression. Although we
were unable to obtain more matched samples before and after the development of resistance
to anti-HER2 therapy, we performed PRKACA immunohistochemistry on a commercially
available breast tissue microarray. We found that, compared to normal breast tissue or
benign breast disease, a large proportion of invasive breast cancers expressed high levels of
PRKACA (Fig. S7). These findings demonstrate that PRKACA overexpression is a common
feature of invasive breast cancers, and suggest that it may play a role in intrinsic as well as
acquired resistance to anti-HER2 therapy.

Author Manuscript

The observations that PRKACA appears to confer resistance to HER2-targeted therapy via
BAD phosphorylation and that PIM1 and PIM2, which also scored in our screens, have been
reported to phosphorylate BAD suggested that BAD may be involved in PIM-mediated
resistance to anti-HER2 directed therapy. We first confirmed that PIM1 rescues HER2amplified cells from lapatinib and trastuzumab treatment (Fig. 4A and 4C). We further
found that PIM1 expression restores BAD phosphorylation at ser112 in the presence of
lapatinib (Fig. 4D) and also inhibits lapatinib-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1D). These findings
support the hypothesis that PIM1 expression promotes survival in lapatinib-treated cells by
restoring BAD phosphorylation and thereby suppressing apoptosis. Although PIM2 also
scored in the initial screens, in validation studies we were unable to express PIM2 at levels
comparable to other candidates and therefore did not pursue this candidate further (Fig. S3).

Author Manuscript

Based on our hypothesis that phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD in lapatinib-treated
HER2-amplified cells allows continued survival signaling through modulation of BCL-XL
activity, we reasoned that BCL-XL overexpression should also confer resistance to HER2
inhibition. Indeed, we found that overexpression of BCL-XL rescues cells from lapatinib
treatment (Fig. 4B, 4C). We therefore hypothesized that combined inhibition of BCL-XL
and HER2 would result in increased cell death of HER2-positive cells and would at least
partially abrogate the resistance effects conferred by PRKACA and PIM1. Indeed, treatment
of ZR-75-30 cells with a dual BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor, ABT-263, at a dose that on its own
had no effect on cell viability, synergized with lapatinib to cause increased cell death (Fig.
4E and 4D, LACZ controls). Furthermore, the addition of this drug also partially abrogated
the lapatinib rescue effect conferred by PRKACA, PIM1, and BCL-XL (Fig. 4E and 4D).

These findings support the hypothesis that activation of BCL-2/BCL-XL at least partially
underlies the lapatinib resistance conferred by PIM1 and PRKACA overexpression, and
suggest that combined blockade of BCL-2/BCL-XL survival signaling and HER2 could
enhance tumor responses and decrease rates of recurrent and resistant disease.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Resistance to targeted therapy in breast cancer remains a major clinical problem. Although
significant clinical benefit has been achieved in HER2-positive breast cancers with the
introduction of the anti-HER2 drugs trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab
emtansine, such cancers remain nearly universally fatal once metastasis has occurred (31–
34). Even in cases in which complete clinical responses are observed, it is evident that
residual viable cancer cells remain which ultimately give rise to resistant disease.
Eradication of residual disease is critical for preventing the emergence of resistance, and we
hypothesize that this may be achieved by combining additional targeted therapies with antiHER2 therapy.
Efforts to target resistant or residual disease in HER2-positive breast cancer thus far have
largely focused on canonical downstream targets of HER2 signaling, such as PI3K, mTOR,
and MEK, whose activation may serve to bypass the upstream HER2 blockade. However,
such approaches have met with limited success in early phase clinical trials (35, 36). In
addition, eradication of residual disease early in treatment may require targeting pathways
that are independent of HER2 signaling, while simultaneously targeting HER2.

Author Manuscript

To identify a broad spectrum of biological pathways that help evade the blockade of HER2
signaling, we used an unbiased, systematic approach to interrogate 597 kinases and kinaserelated molecules for their ability to confer resistance to a small molecule EGFR/HER2
inhibitor or to an anti-HER2 shRNA in HER2-dependent BT474 cells. We chose this dual
approach in order to identify robust biological mediators of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy,
irrespective of the specific mechanism by which HER2 signaling was blocked. We note that
the expression of oncogenic versions of HRAS or KRAS or of activated MEK, as well as
MAP2K6, CRKL, AKT1, or AKT3 conferred resistance to both the HER2 inhibitor and the
anti-HER2 shRNA. These results confirm prior work implicating the MAPK and PI3K
pathways in resistance to anti-HER2 therapy, and serve to validate the screening approach
(8–15, 18, 19).

Author Manuscript

In addition to identifying expected mediators of PI3K and MAPK signaling, the most robust
mediators of resistance that scored in both screens and that are not implicated in canonical
signaling downstream of HER2 were PRKACA and PIM1. Consistent with these findings,
downregulation of a regulatory subunit of PKA, PRKAR2A, has been reported to confer
resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-amplified cells in vitro (37). Both PRKACA and PIM1
converge on activation of survival signaling through inactivation of BAD. We found that
both lapatinib and trastuzumab treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer cells results in
BAD de-phosphorylation, suggesting that the anti-cancer effects of these drugs are in part
mediated by BAD activation and its subsequent inhibition of survival signaling. Since AKT
and RSK are also known to phosphorylate BAD, it is possible that BAD inactivation

represents a common downstream node through which resistance induced by PI3K or
MAPK pathway activation is partly mediated and through which HER2 activation itself
promotes survival in the absence of anti-HER2 treatment.

Author Manuscript

The clinical relevance of our findings to human breast cancers is underscored by our finding
of increased levels of PRKACA expression in three out of five breast cancer samples that
developed clinical resistance to trastuzumab. Together with our results showing that
PRKACA expression activates survival signaling in HER2-positive breast cancer cells
treated with anti-HER2 therapy, these findings support the hypothesis that high levels of
PRKACA expression mediate treatment resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer. Results
from a tissue microarray of primary invasive breast cancers demonstrating strikingly high
levels of PRKACA in a subset of samples, as compared to benign breast tissue, raises the
possibility that PRKACA may play a role in intrinsic as well as acquired resistance. It is
notable that only approximately 50% of trastuzumab-naïve, metastatic HER2-positive breast
cancers undergo objective responses upon treatment with trastuzumab-based therapy,
indicating that a subset of HER2-positive breast cancers do exhibit intrinsic resistance (33).
The finding of high levels of PRKACA expression in a subset of primary invasive breast
cancers also suggests that PRKACA may play a role in breast cancer progression. Indeed, a
recent report showed that bi-allelic ablation of PRKAR1A, one of the regulatory subunits
that inhibits PRKACA activity, results in spontaneous mammary tumorigenesis in mice (38).
In addition, a chimeric transcript involving PRKACA that retains kinase activity has
recently been identified in 15/15 human fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinomas, and
somatic activating mutations in PRKACA have been identified by two groups in 37–66% of
adrenal adenomas from patients with Cushing’s syndrome (39–41). These findings further
support a role for PRKACA in tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

Our findings suggest that inhibition of PRKACA and/or its downstream anti-apoptotic
effectors in combination with anti-HER2 therapy may prevent the emergence of resistant
disease. Since activation of PIM1, AKT1, RSK, or p70S6K is also known to result in BAD
phosphorylation and subsequent activation of BCL-XL/BCL-2 [reviewed in (28)], blockade
of this signaling pathway may provide a robust means of simultaneously targeting multiple
mechanisms of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. Our finding that the BCL-XL/BCL-2
inhibitor ABT-263 synergizes with lapatinib in HER2-amplified cells supports this
hypothesis. Indeed, recent work showed that blockade of this pathway also synergizes with
tamoxifen in ER-positive breast cancers, suggesting that co-targeting of BCL-XL/BCL-2
with either ER- or HER2-directed therapies may represent a useful strategy across breast
cancer subtypes (42). ABT-263 is currently under investigation in early phase clinical trials
in a variety of cancers, although not in combination with anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer
(Clinicaltrials.gov).
Although our observations strongly suggest that the resistance effect conferred by both
PRKACA and PIM1 overexpression is at least in part mediated through the restoration of
anti-apoptotic signaling, it is possible that other pathways that contribute to this phenotype
are also activated by PRKACA and/or PIM1. PRKACA in particular has been implicated in
a variety of cellular processes, which vary by cell type and context. Moreover, the
observation that the degree of rescue conferred by PRKACA is greater than that conferred

by PIM1 suggests that PRKACA may induce additional antagonistic effects to anti-HER2
therapy. Further studies will be necessary to identify such mechanisms.
In summary, we have identified PRKACA as a molecule that is frequently overexpressed in
invasive and trastuzumab-resistant breast cancers and have demonstrated that PRKACA
overexpression leads to resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib. We have also identified
PIM1 as a novel mediator of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy and, by identifying the
survival mechanism through which both PRKACA and PIM1 signal to promote resistance to
anti-HER2 therapy, we have discovered a common resistance node whose simultaneous
targeting along with HER2 may lead to improved tumor responses. Specifically, our study
provides a rationale for further investigation of combined anti-HER2 and anti-BCL-XL/
BCL-2 therapy in HER2-positive breast cancers. Such studies could lead to better responses
and a decrease in residual disease, treatment resistance, and tumor recurrence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Lentiviral Transduction
All cell lines were grown in media containing 10% FBS (Sigma) and 1% Penicillin/
Streptomycin (GIBCO) (293T: DMEM; BT474 and ZR-75-30: RPMI; SkBr3: McCoy’s
5A).
For lentivirus production, 293T cells were co-transfected with VSV-g and delta 8.9
packaging plasmids and the target plasmid using Mirus TransIT L1 transfection reagent
according to manufacturer’s instructions. The following morning, media was replaced with
DMEM containing 30% FBS, and lentiviral supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hours
post-transfection, pooled, and stored at −80 degrees C.

Author Manuscript

Lentiviral transductions were performed at 1:20 to 1:10 dilution in media containing 8 ug/ml
polybrene. Cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm×15 min and allowed to infect for 24h at 37
degrees C, followed by a change to media with or without puromycin (pLKO) or blasticidin
(pLX303 and pLX304). Puromycin doses were 2 ug/ml for all cell lines and blasticidin
doses were 5 ug/ml for SKBr3 and 15 ug/ml for BT474 and ZR-75-30.
Kinase ORF Library Screening

Author Manuscript

Kinase library lentivirus production was performed as previously described (20). Optimal
viral dilution was determined by titering in BT474 cells to ensure high infection efficiency
with minimal viral toxicity. BT474 cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells per well of
384-well plates. The following day, cells in each duplicate set of plates were transduced in
quadruplicate with each lentivirally-delivered ORF (pLX304, Addgene) at 1:25 dilution in
media containing 10 ug/ml polybrene; each ORF was tested in duplicate. Plates were
centrifuged for 15 min at 930×g. After 24 h, virus was removed and cells were re-fed with
media. On day 4, one set of kinase-library transduced ORFs was treated with 0.85 uM
AEE788 or DMSO; blasticidin 15 ug/ml was also added to all wells at this time for selection

efficiency, which was >70% for >90% of ORFs, with an average of 91%. The second set of
replicate plates was transduced with 4 ul (1:12.5 dilution) of pLKO-shHER2-4355, or mock

transduction, in media containing 10 ug/ml polybrene. The latter set of plates underwent a
media change on day 5 to remove virus. On day 10, 30 ul of Cell-Titer Glo reagent
(Promega) was added to each well and luminescence was read 20 min later using Wallac
Envision software.
Plasmids and Drugs

Author Manuscript

pLX304-ORF and pLKO-shRNA constructs were obtained from the Broad Institute Genetic
Perturbation Platform (all available in Addgene). For the generation of PRKACA kinasedead (K72H), the following PCR primers were used with pLX304-PRKACA-WT as
template to generate overlapping 5’ and 3’ PRKACA fragments containing the appropriate
mutations: PRKACA-KD-Fwd GAA CCA CTA TGC CAT GCA TAT CCT CGA CAA
with pLX304-Rev 5’-CAA CAC CAC GGA ATT GTC AG-3’; PRKACA-KD-Rev TTG
TCG AGG ATA TGC ATG GCA TAG TGG TTC with pLX304 Fwd 5’-CAC CAA AAT
CAA CGG GAC TT-3’. The fragments generated were then gel purified (Qiagen) and
combined as template for PCR with pLX304-Fwd and pLX304-Rev to generate the fulllength PRKACA-KD coding sequence containing the K72H mutation. The mutant construct
was confirmed by sequencing.
AEE788 was a generous gift from Novartis, lapatinib (Tykerb) was purchased from Selleck
Chemicals, ABT-263 (Navitoclax) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, and
trastuzumab (Herceptin) was purchased from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute pharmacy.
Luminescence Assays

Author Manuscript

For ATP-based viability assays, 40 ul of Cell Titer Glo (Promega) was added to each well of
a 96 well plate containing 100 ul media. For caspase 3/7 cleavage assays, 50 ul of Caspase
3/7 Glo reagent (Promega) was added to wells containing 50 ul media. Luminescence was
read 20 minutes later using Wallac Envision software. For Caspase 3/7 Glo experiments, pvalues were determined by 2-tailed paired t-test.
Immunoblot Analyses

Author Manuscript

Cells were washed with PBS and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer containing Complete protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and Phos-stop phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysates
were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 degrees C for 20 minutes and protein was
quantified using BCA reagent (Thermo Scientific). 30–50 ug of protein lysate were run on
Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) using MOPS or MES buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by wet transfer or by iBlot (Invitrogen) dry transfer.
Membranes were blocked in 10% milk in 1X PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (PBST) and
were incubated with antibodies in 5% milk or BSA in 1X PBST, according to manufacturers
instructions. Membranes were washed with 1X PBST and incubated with secondary
antibodies (Bio-Rad) in 5% milk/1X PBST at room temperature. Membranes were washed
with 1X PBST and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Antibodies
used were: ERBB2/Neu (Santa Cruz, #sc-7301), HRP-V5 (Invitrogen, #P/N 46-0708), HRPb-actin (Santa Cruz, #sc-47778 HRP), PRKACA (BD Transduction Labs, #610980), HRAS

treated with lapatinib 5 uM or DMSO. Viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion 5
days after the addition of drug. Results show the mean and standard deviation of 3

were transduced with the indicated ORFs. Two days later lapatinib 10 uM or DMSO was
added, and caspase 3/7 cleavage was measured 24h later by luminescent assay. Results
represent the mean and SD of 5 replicates per cell line. For BT474, LACZ vs. PRKACA p =

later for immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. The V5 antibody identifies each
of the V5-tagged ORFs, as indicated. C. Lapatinib or trastuzumab treatment results in loss of
BAD phosphorylation, which is restored by PRKACA overexpression. BT474 cells were
lentivirally-transduced with the indicated pLX304 constructs, blasticidin selected, and
treated with lapatinib 0.1 uM or trastuzumab 10 ug/ml for 24 h. Protein lysates were
harvested and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. The samples
for the p-CREB and CREB immunoblots were run on the same gel, but the lapatinib and
trastuzumab lanes were run in inverse orientation from the other panels, so the image was
cut and re-aligned for labeling consistency with the other panels. D. BAD phosphorylation
was restored by PRKACA overexpression in multiple HER2-positive cell lines after
lapatinib treatment. SKBr3 and ZR-75-30 cells were lentivirally-transduced with pLX304
constructs expressing LACZ or PRKACA, blasticidin selected, and then treated with
lapatinib 0.1 uM or DMSO for 24 h prior to immunoblot analysis with the indicated

analysis of lysates from ZR-75-30 cells three days after ORF transduction in parallel with
the cells used in (E) demonstrates exogenous expression of the indicated proteins. The antiV5 antibody identifies each of the V5-tagged ORFs.

ORF screen identifies mediators of resistance to anti-HER2 treatment. Listed are ORFs that scored ≥ 1.5
standard deviations above the median of all ORFs for their ability to confer resistance to the anti-HER2
tyrosine kinase inhibitor AEE788 or an shRNA targeting HER2. ORFs that are listed in bold scored greater
than two standard deviations above the median in one screen and at least greater than 1.5 standard deviations
above the median in the other screen.
