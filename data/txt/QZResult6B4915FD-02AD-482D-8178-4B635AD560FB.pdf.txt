BACKGROUND. Lytic bone metastases occur frequently in cancer patients and
present major clinical issues including lack of effective therapies. The mechanism
of lytic bone metastases involves interactions between tumor cells, bone matrix,
and bone cells. Both focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Pyk2 are implicated in the

METHODS. The efficacy of PF-562,271 was evaluated using MDA-MB-231 cells
of 5 mg/kg, 7 days per week for 28 days. Serum and urine biomarkers, imaging,
and histologic techniques were deployed to monitor tumor take rate, disease
progression, and response to therapy.

RESULTS. The compound was well tolerated. Both compound-treated groups
demonstrated significant and similar increases in osteocalcin and cancellous
bone parameters. Radiographic evaluation of tumor-bearing tibiae revealed
tumor expansion in nontreated rats compared with a decrease in tumor growth
and signs of bone healing in rats treated with PF-562,271. Tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the
majority of bone resorption at the tumor site was performed by osteoclasts of rat
origin.

CONCLUSIONS. The oral administration of PF-562,271 at a dose of 5 mg/kg suppressed the growth and local spread of intratibial tumors and restored tumorinduced bone loss. The unique ability of PF-562,271 to both curb tumor growth
and safely increase bone formation may be an effective therapy for many cancer
patients with bone metastases and cancer-associated osteoporosis. Cancer

ytic bone metastases are the most frequent form of cancer
metastases in general and are particularly common in breast and
lung cancer patients. Lytic bone metastases develop quickly and
present major clinical issues by causing an increased propensity for
fracture, resulting in pain and disability. Bone metastases serve as
secondary sites of tumor spread, represent the highest tumor burden
in the body, and appear to be more resistant to treatment than
visceral metastases.1 The unique skeletal phenotypes of osteolytic,
osteoblastic, and mixed bone metastases are important variables
when targeting metastatic disease and often require a combination
of interventions because of the complexity of the microenvironment
including the tumors, as well as osteoclasts and the bone matrix.2 In

addition to tumor-induced bone resorption performed by osteoclasts, there are several other causes
of bone loss in cancer patients, most notably deprivation of sex steroids, disuse or immobilization, use
of cytotoxic therapies, radiotherapy, and the use of
palliative therapies such as glucocorticoids.3 Several
bisphosphonates have recently been approved for the
treatment of patients with bone metastases based on
results conducted in animal models and the clinic.4,5
In addition, a human monoclonal antibody that binds
and neutralizes receptor activator of nuclear factor
(NF)-jB ligand (RANKL) demonstrated reduction of
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in patients with
breast cancer-related bone metastases.6 Chemotherapy followed by antiresorptive therapy represents the
current state of the art treatment approach to reduce
tumor burden and preserve quality of life in patients
with metastatic bone disease. To our knowledge,
there currently is no effective single therapy that will
simultaneously kill tumor cells and restore the
tumor-induced loss in bone mass and structure.
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was first identified
in Src-transformed chicken embryonic cells as a 125kilodalton (kD) cytoplasmic tyrosine-phosphorylated
protein associated with focal adhesions.7 FAK has
been reported to play an important role in integrinmediated signal transduction pathways, cell survival,
and cell migration.8 FAK is activated upon cell binding to extracellular matrix proteins. The autophosphorylation of proteins such as FAK appears to be
critical because it creates a high-affinity binding site
for the Src homology 2 domain of Src family kinases,
leading to a transient signaling complex between
FAK and Src family kinases that regulates growth factor-stimulated cell migration through its NH2-terminal FERM domain.9 Changes in integrin expression
have been observed in many cancers.10–12 A related
nonreceptor, tyrosine-kinase Pyk2, was first identified
as a 110-kD, proline-rich tyrosine kinase involved in
the regulation of the calcium-induction ion channel
and MAP kinase.13 Similar to FAK, which undergoes
autophosphorylation at the Tyr397 residue, Pyk2 is
autophosphorylated at Tyr402 and this leads to the
recruitment of Src-family kinases and the activation
of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERKs), regulation of ion channels, cell adhesion, and motility.14,15 Hormones, G-protein-coupled receptor
agonists, stress stimuli, membrane depolarization,
and increases in cellular calcium activate Pyk2.
Unlike the FAK knockout that displays an early embryonic lethal phenotype with extensive defects in
vasculogenesis and angiogenesis,16,17 Pyk2 knockout
mice develop normally except that they exhibit defective macrophage migration.18,19

Both FAK and Pyk2 are implicated in bone and
cancer biology and physiology. Osteoclasts, boneresorbing cells, express both Pyk2 and FAK, with
Pyk2 being more highly expressed. Several studies
have established that FAK and Pyk2 play an important role in integrin avb3-mediated signaling pathways of osteoclast function.20–23 Duong et al.20
demonstrated that Pyk2 in osteoclasts is an adhesion
kinase that is localized in the sealing zone and activated by ligation of avb3 integrin and phosphorylated
by Src kinase. In calcitonin-treated osteoclast-like
cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and
FAK increased, whereas the tyrosine phosphorylation
of Pyk2 is decreased.24 Treatment with fluoroaluminate activates both FAK and Pyk2, resulting in osteoblastic cell proliferation,25,26 but currently very little
is known regarding the role that FAK and Pyk2 play
in bone formation. FAK was first identified as a tyrosine kinase that was expressed in high-grade sarcomas27 and since that time its presence has been
confirmed in many tumor types, particularly in those
that most commonly cause bone metastases such as
breast,28 prostate,29 thyroid,30 and ovarian31 tumors.
Previous studies suggest that cancer cell adhesion,
extravasation, migration, and interaction with bone
cells are critical determinants governing the colonization of bone with cancer cells.32,33 Based on
evidence of FAK and Pyk2 involvement in the physiology of both cancer and bone, the primary goal of
the current study was to assess the potential of the
dual FAK and Pyk2 inhibitor PF-562,271 to induce
changes in tumor invasiveness in the bone microenvironment. Logically, aberrant regulation of FAK
signaling should interfere with the metastatic process by decreasing the ability of cancer cells
to spread and survive in bone. Inhibition of Pyk2
could result in decreased bone resorption, a mechanism by which tumor cells spread in bone with
simultaneous increase in bone formation that can
help bone restoration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Nude (Crl:NIH-rnu) female rats were purchased from
Charles River (Wilmington, Mass). Rats arrived at 10
weeks of age and were maintained in the Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)-accredited research
facility. All in vivo experimental procedures underwent veterinary review and approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The
rats were pair-housed in polycarbonate micro-isolator cages lined with autoclaved bedding. Autoclaved

reverse osmosis (RO) water and autoclaved standard
rat chow were provided ad libitum. Body weights
were recorded weekly throughout the course of the
studies. Animals were maintained for 6 weeks and
euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation at the end
of the experiment. The animals were randomized to
study groups by body weight as follows: intact controls, intact 1 FAK/Pyk, intact tumor-bearing controls,
and intact tumor-bearing 1 FAK/Pyk.

Human Breast Cancer Cell Line
MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells were obtained
from the American TypeCulture Collection (Rockville,
Md). Cells were propagated by standard tissue culture methods in RPMI media containing 10% fetal
bovine serum. Exponentially growing cells were trypsinized and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 2.5 3 107 cells/mL.
PF-562,271-01 (Pfizer, Groton, Conn, lot# 57,69865-2, 93.3% activity) is a potent ATP-competitive,
reversible inhibitor of recombinant FAK and Pyk2
kinase with an IC50 of 1.5 and 14 nM, respectively.34,35
PF-562,271 was formulated for oral dosing using
0.5% methyl-cellulose. On the first day of dosing, rats
received a single dose of PF-562,271 (10 mg/kg) by
oral gavage. Based on the exposure levels at 1 hour
after dosing, the dose was reduced to 5 mg/kg. From
the second day onward, rats were dosed daily with 5
mg/kg by oral gavage for 28 days. Dosing was
initiated 2 weeks after tumor inoculation and only
after the presence of tumors was confirmed by radiography. The presence of the tested compound in
serum was confirmed during the course of the study.
Tumor Injections
Rats were maintained under isoflurane anesthesia
during the tumor injection procedure. The skin surface at the injection site was aseptically prepared
with betadine scrub followed by an alcohol wipe. A
23-gauge needle with a 1-mL syringe was inserted
extracapsullarly through the tibial crest, epiphysis,
and growth plate. Five million tumor cells in a 0.2
mL volume were injected into the bone marrow
space of the right tibial metaphysis. Rats with radiographically detectable tumors at 2 weeks after injection were selected for inclusion in the study. Previous
work has shown that there is no effect of the needle
insertion or vehicle injection (data not shown).
In Vivo Radiography
Radiography of the right hind limb was taken once
every 2 weeks using a Faxitron (Faxitron X-ray,
Wheeling, Ill) digital capture X-ray at Kv 26, magnification of 1.5, and 2-second exposure. Rats were

2315

anesthetized for the X-ray procedure with isoflurane.
Tumor growth was not quantified by X-ray, but
tumor progression was estimated by serial images.
Three reviewers, 2 of whom were blinded to the
treatment, reviewed serial images and made conclusions regarding the effect of PF-562,271 on tumor
progression.

Blood Collection
Blood was collected by retro-orbital collection for
serum chemistry and measurement of various biomarkers. Animals were lightly anesthetized during the colHematology

parameters were analyzed using an Advia 120 (Bayer,
Germantown, NY) automated analyzer. Chemistry endpoints were analyzed using a Hitachi 917 auto analyzer (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind). Terminal blood was
taken under CO2 anesthesia by cardiac puncture. Serum endpoints evaluated included estradiol (E2, Alpco,
Windham, NH), osteocalcin (OC, Nordic, Herlev
Hovedgade, Denmark), c-terminal telopeptide a1
chain of type 1 collagen (CTX) (CTX; Nordic), and
interleukin-6 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn). Drug
levels were measured by the Pharmacokinetics and
Metabolism group at Pfizer using standard procedures.
Urine
Urine was collected during a 5-hour fasting period
using a metabolic cage. To ensure comparable urine
volumes, the rats in all experimental groups were predosed with 2 mL of sterile water by mouth. Samples
were analyzed for creatinine, phosphorus, and calcium using a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) 917 autoanalyzer.
Autopsy
Animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation. The femurs and tibias were dissected and
stored in 10% formalin for microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and histologic analyses.
Micro-CT Imaging
Cancellous bone of the proximal tibia was analyzed
using a microCT-40 computed tomography system
(Scanco Medical, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) and analysis software methods previously described.36 Briefly,
the left tibia was cleaned of soft tissue and the frontal aspect of the proximal tibial metaphysis was
shaved using a scalpel blade. Samples were scanned
at high resolution with a source voltage of 55 kilovolts and milliampere of 145. Three-dimensional
histomorphometric analysis was performed on the
cancellous bone area 1 to 5 mm distal to the growth
plate.

Histology
At the end of the pilot study, the tumor-bearing and
nontumor-bearing tibiae were excised and placed in
10% neutral buffered formalin (Decal Chemical, Congers, NY) at a temperature of 48C for 3 days to allow
for fixation. Tibias were then washed with cold running tap water for 1 hour and then placed in 5%
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 48C for
decalcification and paraffin processing. Sections were
cut at 5 lm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
and osteoclasts were stained with tartrate-resistant
acid phosphatase (TRAP) using the Leukocyte Acid
Phosphatase Kit #387-A (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis,
Mo). Cell number and morphology were evaluated in
the proximal tibial metaphysis. A set of paraffin-embedded tibias were deparaffinized and used for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). In short, rat and
human Cot1 DNAs were labeled by nick translation
with digoxigenin and biotin, respectively. The probes
were mixed in equal volumes and 15 mL of the
probe mix was hybridized overnight under a sealed
coverglass at 378C. The hybridized probes were differentially detected with anti-digoxigenin-FITC
(green) and streptavidin-Cy3 (red). A thin layer of
antifade mounting medium containing the nuclear
counterstain Hoechst 33,258 (blue) was placed on
each FISH slide under the coverglass. Images were
captured with the Applied Spectral Imaging FishView system (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and an epifluorescent microscope equipped with single-pass filters specific to the counterstain and detection reagents.

RESULTS
General
At the end of the 6-week study period, there were
no significant differences noted between treatment
groups with regard to body weight, urine chemistry
(data not shown), or serum chemistry parameters
(Table 1). Compound dosing was well tolerated and
all rats completed the study without displaying any
negative clinical signs. The serum concentration of
PF-562,271 was monitored at various time points
during the study with no differences in exposure
levels noted between intact and tumor-bearing rats
(data not shown).
Bone Metabolism
Bone resorption was assessed using the serum CTX
assay. No significant change in CTX was observed
between groups at the end of 4 weeks of dosing
(Table 1). Bone formation was assessed using serum
osteocalcin at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. Both
groups of rats treated with PF-562,271 demonstrated
a similar, statistically significant, 20% increase in
serum osteocalcin relative to corresponding intact or
tumor-bearing controls (Table 1).

tumor growth in bone, as well as the effect of applied therapy.

X-ray Evaluation of Intratibial Tumor Growth In Vivo
X-ray was successfully employed for monitoring the
intratibial tumor take rate and disease progression or
regression after treatment with PF-562,271 (Fig. 3).
The x-ray images revealed tumor expansion in nontreated rats as evidenced by widening of the osteolytic
area, whereas rats that received PF-562,271 demonstrated a decrease in tumor growth after 2 weeks of
treatment with signs of bone healing as evidenced by
the deposition of new bone (cortical and cancellous)
at sites previously damaged by the tumor.

and structure. Treatment with PF-562,271 improved
some structural parameters including cancellous bone
volume, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness in
nontumor-bearing rats relative to intact controls (Table 2). Micro-CT was also used to obtain 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images of intact tibias (Fig.
1) and tumor-bearing bones (Fig. 2) after autopsy.

DISCUSSION
Bone metastases are a frequent complication of
many common malignancies including carcinoma of
the breast, prostate, and lung, as well as multiple
myeloma. With the exception of prostate carcinoma,
all other tumors cause lytic bone metastases characterized by clinical symptoms including pain, hypercalcemia, pathologic fractures, and spinal cord and
nerve compression. With recent advances in cancer
management, patients with an increased risk of
developing metastatic bone disease are likely to have

a prolonged clinical course and therefore the early
identification and initiation of treatment of those
patients at high risk for developing bone metastases
may help curtail a complex and costly clinical
problem and preserve the quality of life of these
individuals. To our knowledge, there currently are no
effective therapies with which to treat bone metastases. Recent data have indicated that the combination
of bisphosphonates with denosumab reduces skeletal
complications by decreasing bone resorption but has
little effect on the restoration of lytic lesions. The
utility of bone-forming compounds to restore bone
mass and structure in cancer patients is extremely
limited because all known bone anabolic agents are
potent inducers of tumor growth as well as bone
formation.
In bony metastases, the coupling between bone
resorption and bone formation is altered, resulting in
bone loss because of accelerated resorption without a
parallel increase in bone formation. In practice, the

FAK Inhibitor Blocks Tumor Growth in Bone/Bagi et al.

distinctions are not straightforward because the processes of bone resorption and formation are coupled.
Even in prostate carcinoma, which is known to elicit
osteosclerotic bone changes because of increased
formation, bone resorption parameters are also elevated.37 In general, there are several uses for biochemical and/or radiologic assessments of bone
metabolism in the context of oncology. The diagnostic
and prognostic use of bone markers and imaging for
the early detection of skeletal metastasis is of utmost
importance because the radiographic appearance of
metastasis associated with an elevation in bone
resorption is almost always indicative of a poor prognosis.37–40 Bone biomarkers also serve to predict skeletal complications including bone loss, fractures, and
bone pain and guide the use of combination therapies
such as radiation, antiresorptives, and pain killers
aimed at preserving the quality of life for the patient.
Because metabolic activity of bone is predominantly a surface-based phenomenon, with a surfaceto-volume ratio of cancellous bone being approximately 10-fold greater compared with that of cortical
bone, the disorders of bone remodeling associated
with bone metastasis are expressed early and in
more abundance in cancellous rather than in cortical
bone.41 Osteoblasts, which are bone-forming cells,
synthesize and secrete osteocalcin, a 5 to 6-kD, noncollagenus bone matrix protein that comprises 1% to
2% of the total proteins in the skeleton.42 Osteocalcin
is characterized by high binding affinity to hydroxyapatite crystals, a key mineral component of bone.
Osteocalcin also acts as a chemoattractant, influencing the recruitment of osteoblasts and osteoclasts,
and thus contributing to the dynamics of bone remodeling.43
Athymic nude rats have bone metabolism similar
to that observed in normal, immunocompetent rats,
suggesting that the absence of T-lymphocytes per se
does not appear to be the cause of bone loss or deterioration of bone structure.44,45 In the current study,
both groups of rats treated with PF-562,271 for 4
weeks demonstrated increased bone formation indicated by osteocalcin levels (Fig. 2) and mirrored by
improved cancellous bone parameters measured by
micro-CT analysis in tibias of nontumor-bearing rats
(Table 2) (Fig. 4A and 4B). Micro-CT analysis was
performed only on tibias from nontumor-bearing rats
because tibias from tumor-bearing rats did not have
enough bone left at the metaphysis to allow for structural bone analysis. The analysis of the contralateral,
overloaded leg would not be appropriate because rats
tend to favor the healthy leg versus the leg with the
tumor, an event that could result in bone formation
because of increased mechanical stimuli in the over-

2319

loaded limb. Because both FAK and Pyk2 are
expressed in osteoblasts and our compound is a dual
inhibitor, we cannot be definitive as to the role of
each in bone formation.46 Four weeks of dosing with
PF-562,271 resulted in significantly higher cancellous
bone volume because of increased trabecular number
and trabecular thickness in treated rats compared
with controls. Because the bone remodeling cycle in
mature rats is approximately 30 days, dosing of longer duration would be necessary to fully assess the
compound effect on derived structural bone parameters such as connective density and structure model
index. It was shown earlier that Pyk2 regulates the
differentiation of early osteoprogenitor cells across
species and that inhibitors of Pyk2 have bone-forming potential.47 Although to our knowledge Pyk2 has
not yet been directly implicated in cancers,16 its role
in bone resorption could be crucial in curtailing the
local bone resorption triggered by the tumor.
Data from Duong et al.48 suggest that Pyk2 plays
a central role in the adhesion-dependent cytoskeletal
organization and sealing zone formation required for
osteoclastic bone resorption. It was suggested that
p130Cas and its association with Pyk2 may be an
important mediator in the adhesion-dependent signaling that leads to cytoskeletal reorganization and
the formation of the sealing zone during osteoclast
activation.49,50 Miyazaki et al.51 suggested that the
predominant role of Src in osteoclasts might be as
an adaptor molecule, recruiting other proteins that
are necessary for the modulation of integrin-cytoskeletal links, cell attachment, and migration. Therefore,
we hypothesize that the inhibition of Pyk2 could significantly impact bone resorption primarily in the
region around the tumor because those osteoclasts
need to be formed, migrate, and attach to the bone.
Osteoclasts at other skeletal sites should be less
affected by Pyk2 inhibition because they are already
formed and attached to the bone surfaces. The
change in bone resorption at the tumor site may be
too small to be detected by serum CTX, but X-rays
from tumor-bearing rats treated with PF-562,271
clearly indicated less bone deterioration that could,
at least in part, have resulted from suppressed
resorption. Similarly, progressive bone resorption as
observed on the X-rays of the tumor-bearing rats
receiving vehicle was not detected by serum CTX, most
likely because of a relatively small localized change
that is too subtle to be detected by serum assay.
In preclinical studies, PF-562,271 demonstrated a
positive antitumor potential by causing the suppression of MDA-MB-231 tumors in a mouse xenograft
model (data not shown), as well as the suppression of
tumor growth and restoration of bone previously

destroyed by tumor in a rat intratibial model. X-ray
analysis unequivocally confirmed the suppression of
tumor expansion and restoration of both cancellous
and cortical bone because of new bone formation.
The simultaneous inhibition of FAK and Pyk2 could
have an effect on tumor growth in bone by several
mechanisms. First, FAK is a widely expressed protein
tyrosine kinase that plays a key role as a point of convergence in integrin growth factor signal transduction
between cells and their extracellular matrix.20 In lytic
bone metastases, bone stroma plays an enormous
role in supporting tumor growth through the release
of growth factors from the bone matrix during the
process of bone resorption.49,50 Interactions between
FAK and signaling molecules trigger several downstream signaling pathways that regulate cellular functions including spreading, migration, survival, and
cell cycle progression.52 Therefore, the inhibition of
FAK and possibly Pyk2 could interrupt signaling
between tumor and stroma, resulting in altered tumor
growth. Furthermore, the inhibition of FAK could also
impact tumor growth and spread by suppression of
angiogenesis.18–20 FAK also might be involved in the
process of malignant transformation. Recent data
suggest that FAK mRNA expression has prognostic
significance for the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. FAK protein was detected in cancer cells but it was not expressed in corresponding
noncancerous tissues.53 Based on the proposed
mechanism of action, there is a great potential for
this class of drugs to be used in combination with
other therapies. Duxbury et al.54 demonstrated that
the suppression of FAK enhances the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine in a nude mouse orthotopic
xenograft model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, suggesting that cotherapy using inhibitors of FAK could
significantly improve the therapeutic potential of chemotherapeutic agents. Because clinical correlates
have found that the conversion of preinvasive solid
tumors to an invasive state is often accompanied by
elevated FAK expression and tyrosine phosphorylation, the use of FAK and Pyk2 inhibitors in oncology
should be most effective in preventing tumor spread,
a hypothesis that is hard to test preclinically because
of the lack of appropriate models.
In conclusion, the results of the current study
demonstrate that the oral administration of PF562,271 at a dose of 5 mg/kg suppressed the growth
and local spread of intratibial tumors and also
restored tumor-induced bone loss. These unique
properties of PF-562,271, namely the ability to curb
tumor growth and safely increase bone formation,
could be effectively used in many cancer patients
with bone metastases and cancer-associated osteo-

porosis. Finally, this class of drugs has the potential
to be used effectively in combination with other
anticancer therapies as well as with bisphosphonates
to prevent and treat bone metastases.
