Abstract

Author Manuscript

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)vIII is the most common EGFR mutant found in
glioblastoma (GBM). EGFRvIII does not bind ligand, is highly oncogenic and is usually
coexpressed with EGFR wild type (EGFRwt). EGFRvIII activates Met, and Met contributes to
EGFRvIII-mediated oncogenicity and resistance to treatment. Here, we report that addition of
EGF results in a rapid loss of EGFRvIII-driven Met phosphorylation in glioma cells. Met is
associated with EGFRvIII in a physical complex. Addition of EGF results in a dissociation of the
EGFRvIII–Met complex with a concomitant loss of Met phosphorylation. Consistent with the
abrogation of Met activation, addition of EGF results in the inhibition of EGFRvIII-mediated
resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, our study suggests that ligand in the milieu of EGFRvIIIexpressing GBM cells is likely to influence the EGFRvIII–Met interaction and resistance to

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Increased expression of wild type and mutant forms of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) is widespread in cancer. EGFR gene amplification and mutation are common and
striking abnormalities in glioblastoma (GBM) occurring in the classical subtype of the
disease and detected in ~40–50% of GBMs.1–3 A specific EGFR mutant (EGFR Type III,
EGFRvIII, de2–7, ΔEGFR) can be detected in up to one-third of GBMs1,4 and other types of
cancer.5,6 EGFRvIII is the most common EGFR mutant found in GBM and is usually
coexpressed with the EGFR wild type (EGFRwt). EGFRvIII is missing exons 2–7 of the
EGFR and is unable to bind ligand and signals constitutively. Increased EGFRvIII
expression may influence multiple aspects of tumor biology including proliferation of cells,
motility and invasiveness, and resistance to treatment.1,7

Multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are expressed in GBM.8 c-Met is a RTK that is
overexpressed in GBM and also other cancers.9 A number of studies have reported a prooncogenic role of Met in glioma and that inhibition of Met is effective in inhibiting glioma
growth in preclinical models.10–12 Transactivation of Met by EGFR signaling has been
reported for EGFRwt as well as EGFRvIII in GBMs and other cancers.13,14 Phosphorylation
of Y1234 is required for Met activity and is particularly responsive to the presence of
EGFRvIII.15,16 Thus, a number of studies have identified Met as a target of EGFRvIII and
documented that EGFRvIII activates Met. Direct inhibition of the EGFR by using tyrosine
kinase inhibitors is effective in preclinical models but has not proven effective in GBM.17 A
plausible mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibition is the activation of multiple RTKs in
the same tumor.15,18,19 Met is known to be active in glioma and to be activated by
EGFRvIII. A synergistic effect of EGFRvIII and Met was suggested by the finding that
combined inhibition of EGFRvIII and Met seems to be more effective than inhibition of
either alone in glioma models.15,18 It should also be noted that a number of EGFRwt ligands
are expressed in GBM, and the availability of ligands in the vicinity of tumor cells is likely
to influence EGFRwt activation and secondarily affect EGFRvIII signaling.19–22

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have concluded that, whereas in some tumors EGFRvIII distribution is
more restricted or focal compared with EGFRwt (more generalized), EGFRvIII is usually
expressed in cells where EGFRwt is overexpressed.23,24 Our recent data derived from
limiting dilution of clonal cell populations from primary GBM cultures also support
previous work, suggesting that EGFRwt and EGFRvIII are expressed in the same tumor
cells.25
In this study, we report a novel antagonistic interaction between EGFRwt and EGFRvIII
involving Met activation. Consistent with previous studies, we find that EGFRvIII activates

Met in multiple glioma cell lines. However, surprisingly, addition of EGF to EGFRvIIIexpressing cells led to a rapid dephosphorylation of Met. There is no dephosphorylation of
EGFRvIII in response to EGF excluding a global inhibition of EGFRvIII. Inhibition of
EGFRvIII-induced Met activation by activation of EGFRwt is accompanied by an increased
sensitivity to temozolomide, the first-line chemotherapeutic drug used in GBM. We find that
EGFRvIII becomes associated in a physical complex with Met. Addition of EGF with the
resultant activation of EGFRwt results in a disruption of the physical complex between
EGFRvIII and Met. We propose that the EGF-mediated loss of EGFRvIII–Met association
leads to a loss of Met activation. Thus, our study identifies an antagonistic interaction
between EGFRwt and EGFRvIII involving EGFRvIII-induced Met activation and suggests
that the availability of ligand in the vicinity of EGFRvIII and EGFRwt-expressing cells may
be a critical determinant of simultaneous EGFRvIII and Met activation in GBMs,
influencing the malignant phenotype and response to treatment.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Multiple RTKs are expressed in cancer and have an important role in the malignant
phenotype. There is substantial evidence for coexpression and synergistic interactions
between RTKs from different families in cancer. For example, a number of studies have
reported transactivation of Met by EGFR in cancer.13,14,26 Met is linked to aberrant EGFR
signaling in GBM. Furthermore, combined inhibition of Met and EGFRvIII is more
effective in inhibiting the growth of glioma cells compared with the inhibition of either RTK
alone in preclinical models.

We investigated whether activation of coexpressed EGFRwt using ligand would synergize
with EGFRvIII to increase Met activation. To investigate the role of EGFRwt in EGFRvIII
signaling, we used tetracycline-inducible as well as constitutive expression of EGFRvIII in
established glioma cell lines. As EGFRvIII is unable to bind ligand, an inducible system of
expression is particularly useful in studying EGFRvIII signal transduction. U87MG cells
express endogenous EGFRwt and were engineered to express EGFRvIII conditionally in
response to tetracycline (U87vIII-Ind, Figure 1a), as we have described.27 We examined the
phosphorylation of Tyr 1234/1235, a critical step for activation of Met tyrosine kinase and
known to be highly responsive to EGFRvIII expression. Consistent with previous studies,
we find that tetracycline-inducible EGFRvIII expression leads to activation of Met (Figure
1a) in U87vIII-Ind cells. Surprisingly, addition of EGF results in a rapid decrease in Met
phosphorylation in these cells (Figure 1a). The loss of Met phosphorylation in response to
EGF can also be detected in U251vIII-Ind cells expressing EGFRvIII in response to
tetracycline as described previously.22 Expression of EGFRvIII in these cells results in the
activation of Met, an activation that is abolished when EGF is added to cells (Figure 1b).
Similarly, LN229EGFRvIII cells express EGFRvIII constitutively and show activation of
Met. When exposed to EGF, Met phosphorylation is abolished consistent with our results in
other cell lines (Figure 1c). In addition, as EGFRvIII is commonly expressed in EGFRamplified GBMs with increased expression of EGFRwt, we examined a cell line that
overexpresses both EGFRwt (constitutively) and EGFRvIII conditionally in response to
tetracycline (U251vIII-Ind + wt cells). Addition of EGF also results in a loss of Met
phosphorylation in these cells (Figure 1d). Next, we screened a panel of primary GBM

cultures grown as neurospheres in stem cell medium for expression of EGFRwt and
EGFRvIII (Figure 1e). EGFRvIII is truncated and migrates faster than EGFRwt in
electrophoresis gels. We selected neurospheres derived from tumor 987 with significant
expression of EGFRvIII and a lower level of EGFRwt (987-NS). Addition of EGF to 987
neurospheres also resulted in dephosphorylation of Met as seen in established GBM cell
lines (Figure 1f). Notably, however, the addition of EGF does not influence tyrosine
phosphorylation of EGFRvIII in any cell line (Figure 1). Thus, the dephosphorylation of Met
cannot be explained by a global inhibition of EGFRvIII activity. As expected, addition of
EGF increased tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFRwt and resulted in increased ERK
activation (Figure 1).

Author Manuscript

Thus, there is an antagonistic interaction between EGFRvIII and EGFRwt that involves Met.
Synergistic interactions between EGFRwt have been reported previously and involve
autocrine or paracrine loops between EGFRvIII and EGFRwt involving EGFR ligands such
as HB-EGF or cytokines such as IL-6 or heterodimerization between EGFRwt and
EGFRvIII.22,28,29 We have recently shown that EGFRwt has a key role in the activation of
EGFRvIII and oncogenicity.19 In the case of Met activation, however, ligand-mediated
activation of EGFRwt antagonizes EGFRvIII-induced Met activation. Antagonistic
interactions between RTKs of the ErbB family have, to our knowledge, not been reported
previously. We have recently reported one other instance of EGFRwt–EGFRvIII antagonism
and shown that EGFRwt activated by ligand abolishes EGFRvIII-mediated NF-kappaB
activation.25 Moreover, it is important to note that EGFRwt and EGFRvIII levels in the cell
lines used in this study are similar to actual GBM tumors.25
EGF does not influence internalization of Met

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To investigate the mechanism used by ligand-activated EGFRwt to inhibit EGFRvIII-driven
phosphorylation of Met, we examined whether EGFRwt activation resulted in increased
internalization of Met. Internalization of Met could expose it to the activity of phosphatases
resulting in dephosphorylation. Internalization of EGFR and Met was examined by labeling
extracellular proteins with biotin, stimulating the cells with EGF, cleaving the cell surfaceexposed biotin and recovering proteins with Streptavidin followed by western blot, using a
method described previously.30 As expected, EGFR is internalized when EGF is added to
cells; however, we did not detect internalization of Met in response to EGF (Supplementary
Figure 1a). We also examined the distribution of Met in cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates
after EGF treatment. We do not detect a significant change in the cytoplasmic Met level
after EGF treatment, although there may be some decrease in nuclear Met with EGF
treatment (Supplementary Figure 1b). These data suggest that the membrane localization of
Met is not significantly altered by EGF treatment.
EGFRvIII forms a physical complex with Met that is disrupted by EGF treatment
Next, we examined the possibility that EGFRvIII forms a complex with Met in U87vIII-Ind
cells. EGFRvIII is conditionally expressed in response to tetracycline in these cells. We
examined whether EGFRvIII and Met form a complex by immunoprecipitating with a Met
antibody and conducting western blot with an EGFR antibody. As can be seen in Figure 2a,
Met co-immunoprecipitates with EGFRvIII and this association is rapidly lost when

EGFRwt is activated with EGF. As noted, EGFRvIII does not bind EGF or any other ligand.
A similar result is noted in U251vIII-Ind cells (Figure 2b) and in EGFRvIII-expressing
glioma cells that have constitutive overexpression of EGFRwt (Figure 2c). These data
suggest that EGFRvIII association with Met promotes activation of Met. Addition of ligand
with resultant EGFRwt activation results in a loss of Met association with EGFRwt with
concomitant loss of Met phosphorylation. It should be noted that EGFRwt and EGFRvIII
have been reported to form a complex.29 We have also recently confirmed constitutive coimmunoprecipitation of EGFRwt and EGFRvIII without any change with ligand.25

Author Manuscript

These data suggest that the EGFRvIII–Met physical complex is likely to have an important
role in Met activation. Addition of EGF with EGFRwt activation results in a rapid loss of the
EGFRvIII–Met association, with a concomitant loss of Met phosphorylation. We
hypothesize that activation of EGFRwt results in a conformational change in the EGFRvIII
that is complexed with EGFRwt, leading to a disruption of the EGFRvIII–Met association
and loss of Met phosphorylation.
Differential sensitivity to temozolomide with Met dephosphorylation

Author Manuscript

Temozolomide is the first-line chemotherapy drug used in the treatment of GBM.31 As
noted, 40–50% of GBMs have EGFR gene amplification, and EGFRvIII is expressed in up
to one-third of GBMs. Furthermore, EGFRvIII induces resistance to chemotherapy with
temozolomide that is induced, at least in part, by EGFRvIII-induced Met activation.15,18
Thus, we examined EGFRvIII-mediated resistance to temozolomide in our experimental
system under conditions of Met activation or Met dephosphorylation, by examining
resistance to temozolomide-induced toxicity. Firstly, we compared the effect of
temozolomide on cell viability using an MTT conversion assay. As can be seen in Figures
3a and b, expression of EGFRvIII confers resistance to temozolomide in both U87- and
U251-derived cells. Furthermore, the toxicity of temozolomide is increased by exposure of
cells to EGF for 6 h prior to exposing cells to temozolomide. In the absence of EGFRvIII
expression, EGF does not influence temozolomide toxicity. We also compared the response
to temozolomide in both U87- and U251-derived EGFRvIII-expressing cells using an
Annexin-fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay (Figures 3c and d). Similar to the results
with the cell viability assay, we find that the toxicity of temozolomide is significantly
increased by exposure to EGF for 6 h prior to addition of temozolomide in both lines. As
noted, exposure to EGF results in a loss of Met phosphorylation in EGFRvIII-expressing
cells. The cell death induced by temozolomide is represented by an increase in Annexin and
propidium iodide-positive cells (Figures 3c and d). Thus, the EGFRwt-induced loss of
EGFRvIII-driven Met phosphorylation may render cells more sensitive to chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

Next, we investigated the combined effect of Met inhibition with EGFRwt activation with
EGF in the same cells. The experiment was conducted in the presence of tetracycline,
resulting in EGFRvIII expression and Met activation. We used a Met kinase inhibitor,
SU11274 (1 μM). Figures 4a and b show that inhibition of Met in these cells results in
decreased viability of glioma cells. Exposure of cells to EGF prior to SU11274 exposure
results in a statistically significant increased effect on cell viability compared with SU11274
alone, suggesting a complementary effect. The combination of EGF (with resultant

inhibition of EGFRvIII-induced Met phosphorylation) and low-dose SU11274 may result in
a more complete inhibition of Met activity, and thus account for the enhanced toxicity. The
same experiment was performed using an Annexin-fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay
(Figures 4c and d). Similar to the results with the cell viability assay, we find that the
toxicity of SU11274 is significantly increased by prior exposure to EGF for 6 h. It is
important to note that EGF alone for 6 h had no effect on the viability of these cells (Figures
4c and d).
Concluding comments

Author Manuscript

The extent and biological consequences of RTK antagonism in cancer are unknown but
potentially quite intriguing and relevant to pathobiology and treatment. The current study
provides an insight, suggesting that EGFRwt-mediated inhibition of EGFRvIII-driven Met
activation results in a state of increased sensitivity to chemotherapy with temozolomide. In
this context, it was recently shown that ligand induced activation of Met primes cells to
subsequent Met inhibition.32 In our experiments, when both EGFRvIII and EGFRwt are
present, a short exposure to EGF primes cells to treatment with temozolomide, presumably
by inhibition of Met. Future studies in animal models will help to determine whether this is a
viable strategy for treatment.

EGF abolishes EGFRvIII-induced Met phosphorylation in glioma cells. U251MG and
U87MG were used to generate cell lines conditionally expressing EGFRvIII using the T-Rex
Tet-on system from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described previously.22,27 U87vIIIInd cells and U251vIII-Ind cells conditionally express EGFRvIII in response to tetracycline.
EGFRwt in PcDNA 3.1 (Neo) or empty vector were stably transfected into U251EGFRvIIIInd (inducible) and U87EGFRvIII-Ind-expressing cells to generate U251EGFRvIII-Ind + wt
or U87EFRvIII-Ind + wt cells LN229vIII cells have been described previously.33 Primary
GBM cultures were generated directly from resected human GBM tumor specimens
according to the IRB-approved protocols and cultured in Neurobasal medium supplemented
with B27 without Vitamin A, and with EGF (10 ng/ml) and basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF) (10 ng/ml). (a) Expression of EGFRvIII results in Met phosphorylation in U87vIIIInd cells. A western blot showing that exposure to EGF (50 ng/ml) for 15 min results in Met
dephosphorylation. There is no change in phosphorylation of EGFRvIII upon exposure to
EGF. As expected, EGFRwt becomes phosphorylated when EGF is added. In
contradistinction to Met, ERK is phosphorylated upon addition of EGF. (b) The same result
in U251vIII-Ind cells. (c) The same result in LN229 cell constitutively expressing
EGFRvIII. (d) The same result in U87vIII-Ind + wt cells constitutively overexpressing
EGFRwt and conditionally expressing EGFRvIII in response to tetracycline. Cells are
exposed to tetracycline in all three lanes. (e) A panel of primary GBM cultures grown as
neurospheres was screened using western blot for expression of EGFRwt and EGFRvIII. (f)
Neurospheres derived from GBM 987 (987-NS) were cultured in EGF-free medium for 24 h
followed by exposure to EGF and western blot for phosphorylation of Met and quantitation

of signal by densitometry. EGFR (06–847) antibody recognizes both EGFRwt and
EGFRvIII (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), β-actin (sc-47778) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Phospho-EGFR antibodies (Tyr-1068, no. 2236) pERK
(no. 9101), ERK (no. 4695), pMet (Tyr 1234/1235, no. 3077) and Met (no. 8198) antibodies
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Three independent
experiments were performed unless specified otherwise.

EGF disrupts a physical complex between EGFRvIII and Met. (a) U87vIII-Ind cells were
exposed to tetracycline for 24 h as indicated, followed by addition of EGF (50 ng/ml) for 15
min, followed by immunoprecipitation with Met antibodies, followed by western blot with
EGFR antibodies. (b, c) The same experiment was conducted in U251vIII-Ind cells and in
U87vIII-Ind + wt cells. In U251vIII-Ind cells, there is an initial decrease in Met EGFRvIII
association at 15 min followed by a more complete dissociation at 60 min.
Immunoprecipitation was conducted according to the standard protocols using antibodies
described in legend to Figure 1.

EGF enhances sensitivity to temozolomide. (a) An MTT conversion assay was performed in
U87vIII-Ind + wt cells using a Roche Applied Bioscience (Indianapolis, IN, USA) kit
according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the absence of tetracycline+(no EGFRvIII
expression), exposure of cells to EGF (50 ng/ml for 6 h prior to adding temozolomide for 24
h) does not influence sensitivity to temozolomide. Addition of tetracycline with EGFRvIII
expression increases resistance to temozolomide toxicity compared with cells without
EGFRvIII expression (P < 0.0004, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)). In cells
expressing EGFRvIII, addition of EGF results in increased sensitivity to temozolomide (P <
0.0004, one-way ANOVA). (b) The same experiment was conducted in U251vIII-Ind + wt
cells with similar results. (c) Annexin-FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting)
experiment in U251vIII-Ind + wt cells showing that EGF enhances sensitivity to
temozolomide (50 μg/ml) (P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA). Cells were exposed to EGF for
+6h prior to adding temozolomide for 24 h. Annexin and PI staining represent apoptotic and
necrotic cells, respectively. (d) The same experiment in U87vIII-Ind + wt cells. EGFRvIIIexpressing cells are resistant to temozolomide but become sensitive once EGF is added (P <
0.0001, one-way ANOVA). Cells (1 × 106) were plated in six-well plates serum-starved for
24 h followed by EGF treatment for 6 h (50 ng/ml), followed by treatment with
temozolomide (50 μg/ml). Annexin- and PI-positive cells were detected with flow cytometry
using an Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining kit (Roche applied Science) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. * indicates degree of statistical significance. **P < 0.001, ***P <
0.0001.

Combined effect of EGFR wild type activation and Met inhibition. (a) An MTT conversion
assay was performed in U87vIII-Ind + wt cells. Cells were exposed to tetracycline to induce
EGFRvIII expression followed by treatment with a chemical inhibitor of Met kinase
SU11274 alone (plus control vehicle phosphate-buffered saline) or in combination with
EGF. Treatment of these cells with SU11274 results in a decreased viability of cells.
Combined treatment with EGF plus SU11274 results in a significantly increased cell death
compared with SU11274 alone. (b) A similar result was obtained in U251vIII-Ind + wt cells.
(c) Annexin-FACS experiment in U87vIII-Ind + wt cells showing that EGF enhances
sensitivity to SU11274 (one-way ANOVA). Cells were exposed to EGF for 6 h prior to
adding SU11274 for 24+h. (b) The same experiment in U251vIII-Ind + wt cells (P < 0.0001,
one-way ANOVA). The concentration of SU11274 was used in this experiment 1 μM. (d)
The same experiment was conducted in U251EGFRvIII cells with similar results. * indicates
degree of statistical significance. **P < 0.001, ***P < 0.0001.
