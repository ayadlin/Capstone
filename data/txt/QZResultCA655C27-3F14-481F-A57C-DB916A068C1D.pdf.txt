Abstract
Somatostatin analogues (SSAs) have shown limited and variable antiproliferative
effects in neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Whether tumour control by SSAs depends
on grading based on the 2010 WHO NET classification is still unclear. The aim of this
study is to evaluate the efficacy of long-acting SSAs in NETs according to Ki67 index.
An observational Italian multicentre study was designed to collect data in
patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic or thoracic NETs under SSA treatment. Both
retrospective and prospective data were included and they were analysed in line
with Ki67 index, immunohistochemically evaluated in tumour samples and graded
according to WHO classification (G1 = Ki67 index 0-2%, G2 = Ki67 index 3-20%, G3
= Ki67 index > 20%).
Among 601 patients with NET, 140 with a histologically confirmed gastroentero-pancreatic or thoracic NET or NET with unknown primary were treated with
lanreotide autogel or octreotide LAR. An objective tumour response was observed
in 11%, stability in 58% and progression in 31%. Objective response and tumour
stability were not significantly different between G1 and G2 NETs. Progression free
survival was longer but not significantly different in G1 than G2 NETs (median: 89 vs
43 months, p = 0.15). The median PFS was significantly longer in NETs showing Ki67
< 5% than in those showing Ki67 ≥5% (89 vs 35 months, p = 0.005).
SSA therapy shows significant antiproliferative effects in well differentiated low/
intermediate-proliferating NETs, not only G1 but also in G2 type. A Ki67 index of 5%
seems to work better than 3% to select the best candidates for SSA therapy.

Introduction

p = 0.15)(Figure 1). A Ki67 index of 5% was the best cutoff at the ROC analysis to separate patients according to
tumour progression, with a sensitivity and specificity of
65 and 69%, respectively (p = 0.004). When this Ki67
cut-off was considered, PFS was significantly higher
in NETs with Ki67 < 5% than in those with Ki67 ≥5%
(median: 89 vs. 35 months, p = 0.005)(Figure 2). PFS was
not different between GEP and thoracic NET (median: 89
vs. 59 months, p = 0.531), while was higher in GEP and
thoracic NETs than in those with unknown primary tumour
(median: 89 vs. 35 months, p = 0.048), in loco-regional
than metastatic disease (median: 89 vs. 40 months, p =
0.005) and in . Within the GEP group, the median PFS
was 62 months for pancreatic and 102 months for ileal
NETs, without significant differences (p = 0.464). Within
the thoracic group, the median PFS was 59 months for
lung and 42 months for thymic NETs, without significant
differences (p = 0.077). There was no difference between
functioning and non-functioning tumours (median: 59 vs.
89 months, p = 0.710), as well as between sporadic and
MEN1 (median: 59 vs. 89 months, p = 0.533) and between
Octreoscan / 68Ga-PET positive and negative (median: 89
months vs. median not reached, p = 0.965). At the Cox
regression analysis, both ki67 index ≥5% (Exp(B): 2.011,
IC95%: 0.959-4.216) and distant metastases (Exp(B):
1.483, IC95%: 0.990-2.220) were independent negative
prognostic factors.

Somatostatin analogues (SSAs) represent a
consolidated therapeutic approach in patients with
neuroendocrine tumour (NET). Octreotide and lanreotide
have initially been shown effective in controlling
endocrine syndromes associated with NETs [1, 2].
Subsequently, their role as antiproliferative agents
has clearly been demonstrated in randomized trials
conducted in patients with well differentiated NETs [3, 4].
Modern NET guidelines report that SSAs are currently a
therapeutic option in patients with NETs, whatever the site
of primary tumour, stage, or activity [5, 6, 7]. Moreover,
SSAs are started early in the therapeutic algorithm, both
for their efficacy in arresting tumour proliferation and for
their manageability and excellent patients’ tolerance.
SSAs are more frequently shown to induce tumour
stabilization (about 50-80% of patients with progressive
well differentiated NETs) than objective responses ( <
10%) [3, 4, 8, 9]. Recently, two randomized trials have
been conducted in patients with NETs to evaluate the
efficacy of long-acting slow-release SSA formulations
and showed a significant antiproliferative effect [3, 4].
The PROMID study (double-blind placebo-controlled
prospective randomized study), first demonstrated
that octreotide LAR significantly prolonged the time
to progression in a population of metastatic welldifferentiated low-proliferating NETs of small intestine [3].
However, 95% of patients had tumours with Ki67 less than
2%. Subsequently, the CLARINET study (double-blind
controlled study of Lanreotide anti-proliferative response
in NET) performed in patients with non functioning well-/
moderately differentiated GEP NETs (70% G1, 30% G2
with Ki67 ranging 3-10%) and including 45% pNETs,
confirmed a significant improvement of progression free
survival (PFS) in patients treated with lanreotide Autogel
as compared to those receiving placebo [4].
These studies have changed the indication of SSA in
NET therapy even if some concerns still require attention.
In particular, it is unclear whether SSAs are effective in all
type of well-/moderately differentiated NETs, regardless
from Ki67 index.
Thus the aim of the current study was at analyzing
the anti-tumour effects of long-acting lanreotide and
octreotide in patients with NET according to Ki67 index.

Tumour response
An objective tumour response was observed in 11%
of cases. Tumour stability occurred in 58%, while tumour
progression in 31% (Table 4). Objective response and
tumour stability were not significantly different between
G1 and G2 NETs, as well as between loco-regional
disease and distant metastases (Table 4). Clinical benefit
(including objective response and tumour stability) was
not significantly different between G1 and G2 NETs, as
well as between the group of patients with Ki67 index
≥5% and the one with Ki67 index < 5%. On the contrary,
the clinical benefit was significantly higher in patients with
loco-regional disease than in those with distant metastases
(p = 0.002), as well as in patients with GEP NETs than
others (p = 0.02). Tumour stage was not significantly
different between the group of subjects with Ki67 index
≥5% and the one with Ki67 index < 5%.
Among the 14 patients who experienced a switch
from standard to high dose SSA treatment, an objective
response occurred in 2 patients (14.3%), while tumour
progression in 2 others (14.3%). Stable disease was
observed in the remaining 10 (71.4%). In 4 of 5 patients
with clinical syndrome uncontrolled by standard dose of
SSAs, a control of the syndrome was achieved on high
dose regimen.

Results
PFS
The median PFS of 106 G1-G2 NET patients
receiving SSA therapy was 89 months (CI interval,
58.9-119 months). PFS was higher but not significantly
different in G1 than G2 NETs (median: 89 vs. 43 months,

Discussion

an international randomized multicenter phase III trial,
further enlarges the spectrum of NET types to consider
candidates for SSA therapy [4]. In CLARINET, not only
small intestine, but also pancreatic and hindgut NETs
were included, showing a 53% risk reduction to tumour
progression or death with lanreotide versus placebo.
Besides, if PROMID was performed before the 2010
WHO classification of NETs and only included lowproliferating tumours with Ki67 < 2%, CLARINET was
addressed not only to G1 but also to G2 with Ki67 < 10%,
demonstrating that SSAs are effective in both.
If these two pivotal studies have promoted SSAs as
one of the main systemic therapies of NETs, on the other
hand some questions remain unsolved. In particular, it is
not clear if all well differentiated NETs, regardless from
Ki67 index, are responsive to SSAs. In this meaning, G2
with Ki67 between 10 and 20% and even those G3 with
well differentiated histology and Ki67 < 50% could be
potential candidates for SSA therapy. The current study
aims to evaluate SSA therapy in NETs of different origin
and grading and to establish the impact of Ki67 index in

NETs are well recognized to specifically express
somatostatin receptors and to bind SSAs. Their
antiproliferative effects on pancreatic and ileal NET
cells were first demonstrated in vitro [12, 13, 14]. Since
nineties, clinical studies reported SSAs to exert some antitumour efficacy in different types of NET. However, these
data were based on not-randomized studies performed on
small, heterogeneous and retrospective series of patients
[8, 9, 15-18]. Published in 2009, the PROMID study has
been a milestone in the therapy of NETs, because it was
the first randomized prospective phase 3 trial investigating
SSA therapy in NETs [3]. It was possible to demonstrate
that SSAs are an effective and manageable therapeutic
approach in well differentiated low-proliferating NETs
of small intestine. The most relevant consequence was
that SSAs were included in NET guidelines as a valid
therapeutic option in patients with metastatic or inoperable
well differentiated NETs [5-7]. The CLARINET study,

the response to SSA. Although the observational mainly
retrospective study design represents a limitation of the
study, some relevant results have been obtained. The

most relevant finding was that PFS was not significantly
different between G1 and G2, while it was significantly
different according to Ki67 more or less than 5%. Median

PFS was 89 months in NETs with Ki67 < 5% and 35
months in those with Ki67 ≥5%. This finding highlights
a completely different clinical behaviour between these
subgroups. It also explains why there is no difference
in responsiveness to SSAs between G1 and G2 tumours
which are separated by a Ki67 cut-off of 3%. At the
opposite, a cut-off of 5% seems to well distinguish
two subpopulations of well differentiated NETs, those
with low proliferation rate and indolent clinical course
and those with moderately high proliferation rate and
tendency to progression. A previous study performed on
21 nonfunctioning pNETs highlighted that a Ki67 index <
5% correlated with tumour stability under treatment with
octreotide LAR [19]. Again a Ki67 index of up to 5%,
together with pretreatment stability and hepatic tumour
load of up to 25%, were correlated with tumour stability
under treatment with lanreotide [20]. A similar finding has
been also reported in two prognostic studies performed in
lung NETs, [21, 22] where a Ki67 cut-off of 4% was able
to separate patients with significantly different disease free
and overall survival.
Beyond these results, it is not negligible that SSAs
are an effective therapeutic instrument also in well
differentiated NETs with moderately high proliferation
rate. In the current study, clinical benefit of SSAs
was observed in 63% of G2 NETs, although objective
response rate was really scarce and progression rate quite
relevant in this subgroup. Even in G3 NETs is possible to
hypothesize some efficacy of SSAs. Recently, a French
study found a rate of 43% of well differentiated NETs in
the G3 subgroup [23]. There was a significant difference
between well and poorly differentiated G3 NETs in terms
of octreoscan uptake (88 vs 50%) and median overall
survival (41 vs 17 months). All responders to cisplatin
chemotherapy were poorly differentiated G3 NETs. Of
consequence, the well differentiated G3 NETs could
constitute a NET subgroup different from other G3. SSAs
could be effective in this subgroup as in G1-G2. In the
current study, 30 patients of the 140 who were initially
selected as SSA population belonged to the subgroup G3.
All of them were excluded from this analysis because of
concomitant systemic therapies. To avoid confounding
results this subgroup will be analyzed in a separate study.
Interestingly, Ki67 index and tumour stage resulted
to be both independent negative prognostic factors of
progression at the multivariate analysis, suggesting that
NET patients with Ki67 < 5% are expected to be the best
responders to SSAs regardless from any other factor. This
finding from a large series of NET patients is a helpful
element to define the identikit of the best candidate to SSA
therapy, following the initial indications pointed out by the
PROMID and CLARINET studies [3, 4].
Another point of interest in NET therapy with
SSA concerns the use of high dose schedules in place
of standard dose [24]. To shorten the interval of
administration of octreotide LAR from 30 mg every 28
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

days to 30 mg every 21 days was proven to slow tumour
progression in patients with GEP and thoracic well
differentiated NETs [25]. Previously, very high dose
octreotide and lanreotide treatment resulted in high rate
of tumour stabilization in patients with progressive well
differentiated GEP NETs [26, 27]. In one study, where
lanreotide was used in subcutaneous formulation at
the dose of 15 mg a day, one complete and one partial
objective response were also observed [26]. The current
study was not focused on this aspect. However, in 14 of
106 patients there was a switch from standard to high dose
SSA treatment, following tumour progression in 9 and
uncontrolled clinical syndrome in 5. An objective response
was observed in 14.3%, while stable disease in 71.4%
of cases. Control of clinical syndrome was achieved in
80% of those patients who were still symptomatic under
standard doses of SSAs.
In conclusion, SSA therapy shows significant
antiproliferative effects in well differentiated low/
intermediate-proliferating NETs, not only G1 but also in
G2 type. A Ki67 index ≤5% seems to indicate the best
candidates for SSA therapy. Further prospective studies
need to be performed on this topic as well as on the role
of SSA in G2 with Ki67 > 10% and in well differentiated
G3 NETs, on the role of SSA high dose in NET therapy.

Patients and Methods
Study design
This is an observational Italian multicentre study
designed to collect data on patients with gastro-enteropancreatic and thoracic NETs or NETs with unknown
primary origin who were receiving treatment with SSA.
The observational data have been collected through an
e-CRF and stored in a centralized computer database
ad hoc created. Both retrospective data of patients in
treatment with SSA from 2005 and prospective data
of patients treated with SSA from March 2012 to April
2014 were included. Objective response rate (ORR)
and progression free survival were evaluated according
to Ki67 index, evaluated by counting the percentage of
nuclei positive to the Mib-1 primary antibody upon 2000
tumour cells.
Between January 2005 and April 2014, 601 patients
diagnosed with NET in the five centres involved in the
study were examined as potentially eligible for the study.
Inclusion criteria were: a) a histologically documented
diagnosis of NET, revised according to the last WHO
classification criteria for NET of gastro-entero-pancreatic,
bronchial and thymic origin [10, 11] b) Ki67 index
immunohistochemically evaluated in representative
tumour samples to grade tumours according to WHO
classification of NETs (G1 = Ki67 index 0-2%, G2 = Ki67
5544

Oncotarget

index 3-20%, G3 = Ki67 index > 20%), c) treatment with
SSAs at standard doses for at least 3 months (octreotide
LAR 30 mg/28 d, lanreotide autogel 120 mg/28 d). In each
center involved in the study, the pathological diagnosis
was revised by at least two pathologists dedicated to NET
and participating to the multidisciplinary tumour board for
NET.
Exclusion criteria were: a) histology not revised
according to the last WHO classifications, b) Ki67 index
unavailable, c) treatment with SSAs for < 3 months. The
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki and approved by the Federico II University
Ethics Committee (protocol n°227/2011 approved on
11/01/12). All patients gave written informed consent.

criteria and resulting to be affected with G1 (49 patients)
and G2 NET (57 patients), according to Ki67 index,
form the basis for the statistical analysis (Table 2). Both
in G1 and G2 NETs, pancreas was the main primary site
followed by ileum and lung. Sporadic NETs accounted
for the most of cases while MEN1 NETs were about one
fourth of G1 tumours and a minority of G2. Tumour stage
was equally balanced between G1 and G2. NET was
functioning in 79% of G1 and 88% of G2, respectively.
The most frequent syndrome was carcinoid syndrome in
G1 and ZES in G2. Abnormally increased serum CGA
occurred in 55% of G1 and 60% of G2. Octreoscan and
68
Ga-DOTATATE PET uptake was similar in G1 and G2
(Table 2).

Patient characteristics

Treatment with SSA

Data of 140 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria
have been reported in the current study. Mean age was
59±2.6 yrs. Male:female ratio was 1.1 (Table 1). Onehundred twenty-three patients had a sporadic NET (88%)
and 17 a MEN1-related NET (12%). The most frequent
site was pancreas accounting for 44% of cases, followed
by lung (19%) and ileum (12%) (Table 1). Tumour grading
was G1 in 35%, G2 in 44%, G3 in 21%. Tumour stage
included NETs without metastases in 26%, locoregional
metastases in 29%, distant metastases in 45%. Primary
tumour had been surgically removed in 66% of patients.
NET was non-functioning in 85% of cases. Functioning
NET accounted for 15% of cases, including ZollingerEllison syndrome (ZES) in 4.3%, hypoglycemic
hyperinsulinemic syndrome in 3.6%, carcinoid syndrome
in 7.1%. Abnormally increased neuroendocrine markers
were serum chromogranin-A (CGA) in 47% patients,
gastrin in 7.8%, insulin/C-peptide in 3.6% and/or 24-hour
urinary 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) in 7.1%
(Table 1).
A somatostatin receptor scintigraphy was performed
in 61 patients, by using intravenous injection of Indium111-DTPA-Phe1-octreotide (Octreoscan, Mallinckrodt
Medical, Petten, The Netherlands; 120-200 MBq) with
SPECT/CT fusion images. Octreoscan was positive in 46
cases (75%). A 68Ga-DOTATATE PET was performed in
35 patients, by administering 120-220 MBq of activity,
with acquisition of images 45-60 min post-injection. There
was a positive 68Ga-PET uptake in 29 cases (83%).
In 34 of the 140 cases (24%), including 30 with
G3 (100% of this subgroup) and 4 with G2 NET (6%
of this subgroup), other systemic anti-tumour therapies
were started concomitantly or within 3 months from the
beginning of SSA therapy. In particular, other therapies
concomitant to SSA were chemotherapy in 27 cases and
targeted therapy in 7 cases. To limit confounding data, we
excluded from final analysis all patients with G3 and 4
patients with G2 NET treated with therapies other than
SSAs. Finally 106 patients, entering all the inclusion

Initial SSA treatment included octreotide LAR 30
mg/28 d in 71 patients and lanreotide autogel 120 mg/28
d in 35 patients. The median treatment duration with SSA
was 23 months (range, 3-88 months). The initial SSA dose
subsequently changed in 14 patients, because of tumour
progression in 9 and uncontrolled clinical syndrome
in 5. Octreotide was switched to lanreotide in 6 cases
(Table 3). At the final follow-up under SSA treatment, 65
patients received octreotide LAR and 41 patients received
lanreotide autogel.

Efficacy and safety assessment
Efficacy was evaluated in terms of progression
free survival (PFS) and tumour response according to
the RECIST definitions for tumour [19]. The radiologic
assessment of tumour lesions was performed by contrast
enhanced computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), at baseline and every 3-6
months during the follow-up period. Endoscopy and
endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) were also performed in
combination with CT/MRI where appropriate. In patients
experiencing increase of SSA dose after initial tumour
progression, PFS was evaluated at the last SSA dose.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed with the
SPSS package (Cary, NC, USA). Data were expressed as
mean±SEM. The significance was set at 5%. Comparisons
of tumour responses among different groups of patients
were performed with the Chi-square test with Yates
correction or Fisher exact test. PFS was calculated using
the Kaplan-Meier method and comparison between
subgroups was performed by using the log-rank test. Cox
regression analysis was performed to compare variables
which were significant at the univariate test. The Ki67

index was analyzed by receiver operator characteristic
(ROC) analysis by using a non parametric model to
determine the best cutoff to distinguish patients who are
in progression from those who are not in progression.
