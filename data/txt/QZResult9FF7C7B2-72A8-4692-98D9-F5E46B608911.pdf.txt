FBI-1 Promotes Cell Proliferation and
Enhances Resistance to Chemotherapy of
Hepatocellular Carcinoma In Vitro and In
Vivo
Feng Fang, MD, Lianyue Yang, MD, PhD, Yiming Tao, MD and Wei Qin, MD

BACKGROUND: The so-called factor that binds to inducer of short transcripts-1 (FBI-1) purportedly plays an important role in tumorigenesis; however, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The objective of this
study was to investigate the expression level, clinical relevance, and biologic function of FBI-1 in HCC. METHODS:
Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect expression levels of FBI-1 and to analyze its relation to clinicopathologic
parameters and to the prognosis of patients with HCC. In addition, the biologic functions of FBI-1 in regulating cell
proliferation, migration, and reaction to chemotherapy were detected by using HepG2 cells and SMMC-7721 cells; subsequently, the molecular mechanism of FBI-1 also was investigated. Finally, a xenograft mouse model was used to validate the observations obtained from in vitro studies. RESULTS: Expression levels of FBI-1 messenger RNA and
protein were elevated significantly in HCC tissues compared with adjacent nontumorous liver tissues (ANLTs).
Increased FBI-1 expression was correlated with multiple tumor nodes, Edmondson-Steiner grade, and a poor prognosis in patients with HCC (P < .05). In vitro studies revealed that FBI-1 was capable of promoting cell proliferation (but
not cell migration) by regulating the cell cycle regulation proteins p53, p21, and p27. In addition, FBI-1 could inhibit
cell death induced by 5-fluorouracil or doxorubicin through suppressing the activation of p53. Consistent with the in
vitro data, FBI-1 was capable of promoting cell proliferation and enhancing chemotherapy resistance of HCC in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings indicated that FBI-1 plays an important role in HCC carcinogenesis and chemotherapy tolerance, and FBI-1 may served as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC. Cancer

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common human malignancy worldwide, especially in China.1

With constantly increasing frequency, great numbers of new HCC diagnoses have been made every year (626,000).2
Because of its highly malignant potential, HCC ranks as the third leading cause of cancer death in the world, resulting in
almost 600,000 deaths each year.2,3 During the past decade, hepatic resection, which is the first treatment choice for
HCC, has evolved into a safe procedure with an operative mortality rate <2% reported in some large clinical centers.4
However, with 5-year survival rates between 20% and 30% reported in the literature, the long-time survival of patients
with HCC remains unsatisfactory because of the challenging problems in treating advanced and metastatic HCC.5,6
Highlighting the mechanism that underlies the tumorigenesis of HCC is extremely important for its prevention and
therapy. In recent years, investigators have achieved a better understanding of the molecular events leading to HCC oncogenesis. In parallel, multiple novel therapeutic agents are being assessed in HCC. There is accumulating evidence for the
multistep nature of HCC.7 Epidemiological studies have revealed that many environmental risk factors, including chronic
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV infections, aflatoxin exposure, chronic alcohol abuse, cigarette smoking, and other factors are associated with the incidence of HCC.8,9 In addition to environmental risk factors, genetic aberrations and molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of HCC have been uncovered in recent years, indicating

their critical role in the initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis.
For example, mutations in the p53, retinoblastoma (Rb),
and/or insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR1)
genes have been reported in HCC,10 and the c-myc, locus
at 8q24.12-13 frequently is up-regulated in HCC.11 Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain 7 (Egfl7), which
is overexpressed in HCC, may promote metastasis of
HCC through regulating focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
phosphorylation in an EGF receptor (EGFR)-dependent
manner.12 Mutations of b-catenin commonly are
observed in the early development of HCC, and disruption of this Wnt signaling protein affects the expression of
its target genes, including c-myc, c-jun, cyclin D1, and fibronectin.13,14 Work is ongoing to further identify novel,
important HCC-associated proteins that may have profound effects as diagnostic or prognostic markers as well
as molecular therapeutic targets to improve the outcome
of patients with HCC.
FBI-1 (factor that binds to inducer of short transcripts-1) (also called leukemia/lymphoma-related factor
[LRF]; osteoclast-derived zinc finger [OCZF]; Pokemon;
and zinc finger and BR-C, ttk, and bab [BTB] domaincontaining 7 [ZBTB7A]), which originally was purified as
a transcription factor that binds to the bipartite inducer of
the short transcripts element of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, is a novel poxvirus and zinc finger
(POZ)/BTB and Kruppel (POK) protein family member.15 POK proteins consist of an N-terminal POZ domain and a C-terminal Kruppel-type (C2H2) zinc finger
domain. The C-terminal zinc fingers recognize and bind
specific DNA sequences, and the POZ domain mediates
homodimerization or heterodimerization and interacts
with other proteins, such as corepressors, histone deacetylase, and other transcription factors, to regulate transcription.16-18 Previous studies have confirmed that FBI-1, as
an important proto-oncogene, had multiple roles in carcinogenesis. Maeda et al reported that mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking FBI-1 were resistant to various
oncogene-mediated transformation, and this resistance
was restored when FBI-1 was coexpressed, suggesting a
central role of FBI-1 in oncogenesis.19 The potential of
FBI-1 as a genuine proto-oncogene also was examined in
vivo in transgenic mice experiments in which mice with
immature T-lymphoid and B-lymphoid cells that overexpressed FBI-1 developed thymic lymphomas and tumor
infiltration of bone marrow.19 FBI-1 also enhances

inhibitor, alpha (IjBa) or IjBb through an interaction
between the POZ domain of FBI-1 and the Rel homology
domain (RHD) of NF-jB.20 In addition, FBI-1 can stimulate cell proliferation by repressing transcription of the
tumor suppressors Rb, alternate reading frame (ARF),
and p21.18,21
FBI-1 is overexpressed in some human cancers,
including lymphoma, nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, malignant gliomas, breast carcinoma, ect.19,22-24 It is noteworthy
that, despite the accumulation of evidence from in vitro
and animal studies, to our knowledge, no analyses of any
correlation between FBI-1 expression and clinicopathologic
variables, patient prognosis, or the biologic function of
FBI-1 in HCC have been reported to date. In the current
study, we sought to determine expression levels of FBI-1 in
HCC and their correlation with clinicopathologic characteristics and the prognosis of patients with HCC to explore
its clinical value. Furthermore, the biologic function and
molecular mechanism of FBI-1 in HCC carcinogenesis also
were investigated both in vitro and in vivo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Tissue Specimens
HCC tissue specimens were obtained from 129 patients
with HCC who underwent hepatic resection at the
Department of Surgery, Xiangya Hospital of Central
South University between February 1998 and December
2005. These patients included 111 men and 18 women,
and the median age was 45 years (range, 16-71 years).
Specimens were paraffin embedded and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Among the 129 HCC specimens,
matched fresh specimens of HCC and adjacent nontumorous liver tissue (ANLT) specimens from 34 patients were
collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen for detection with
real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses.
Previous informed consent was obtained, and the study
protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Changsha
City, People’s Republic of China).
Real-Time qRT-PCR and RT-PCR
Real-time qRT-PCR and RT-PCR were performed as
described previously.25 The following primers were used
for real-time qRT-PCR: For FBI-1, the forward primer
was 50 -TATGTCGCCAGATGCCAGGA-30 , and the
reverse primer was 5 0 -GTCTCAGTGCAGCAGAG
CGTCTA-3 0 ; and, for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the forward primer was 50 GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC-30 , and the reverse
primer was 50 -TGGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGA-30 . The
following primers were used for RT-PCR: For FBI-1, the
forward primer was 50 -TGTGGGATAAACAGAGTCA
CGATC-30 , and the reverse primer was 50 -CAGAAGTGGATTCTACGTTTGTGGT-30 ; and, for GAPDH, the
forward primer was 50 -CTGCAGCATCTTCTCCT
TCC-30 , and the reverse primer was 50 -CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-30 . The results of real-time qRT-PCR
were analyzed by using the 2 DDCt method according
to the formula DDCt ¼ (CtHCC-CtGAPDH)  (CtANLT 
CtGAPDH).
Western Blot Analysis
Total protein was extracted and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then
transferred onto polyvinylidene membranes (Millipore,
Bedford, Mass). The blotted membranes were incubated
with antihuman FBI-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif) or with antihuman p27, p53,
p21, and mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) antibodies
(all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then, in order,
with secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Beta-actin protein levels also were determined by using
the specific antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo) as a loading
control.
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed paraffin sections (4 lm thick) were cut for
immunohistochemical staining. After previous treatment
as described elsewhere,12 the tissue sections were stained
for FBI-1 (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
using the streptavidin-peroxidase system (Zhongshan
Goldenbridge Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). Negative
control slides were probed with normal goat serum under
the same experimental conditions. The immunohistochemical staining was scored by using the following
4-point scale according to the percentage of positive hepatocytes: 0 indicated <10% positive hepatocytes; 1þ, 11%
to 25% positive hepatocytes; 2þ, 26% to 50% positive
hepatocytes; and 3þ, >51% positive hepatocytes.26
Thus, the levels of FBI-1 protein expression in HCC
specimens were divided into a low expression group (with
staining scores of 0 or 1þ) and a high expression group
(with staining scores of 2þ or 3þ). Immunohistochemical analysis and scoring were performed by 2 independent
investigators.

Follow-up and Prognostic Study
Follow-up data were obtained by direct communication
with all 129 patients after they underwent hepatic resection. The follow-up period was calculated from the date
of surgery to the date of either death or last follow-up. Recurrence and metastasis were diagnosed by clinical examination, serial a-fetoprotein (AFP) level measurement, and
ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) scans.
Disease-free survival was defined as the duration of time
that the patient survived after hepatectomy without signs
of HCC. To determine the factors that influenced survival
after surgery, the following 10 conventional variables,
along with FBI-1 expression, were analyzed in all 129
patients: sex, age, preoperative AFP level, hepatitis history, cirrhosis, Child-Pugh score, tumor size, the number
of tumor nodes, Edmondson-Steiner grade, and venous
invasion.
Cell Lines and Cell Cultures
LO2, MHCC97-L, SMMC-7721, HCCLM3, MHCC97H, Huh-7, and Bel-7404 cell lines were purchased from
the Liver Cancer Institute of Fudan University (Shanghai,
China). HepG2 and 293T cell lines were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville,
Md). These cell lines were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco modified Eagle media (Corning Inc., Corning, NY),
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO/
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), and incubated in 5% CO2 at
37 C.
Plasmid Construction
FBI-1 whole-length combinational DNA (cDNA) was
purchased from ATCC. The pBabe-flag-FBI-1 plasmid
was prepared by cloning amplified cDNA fragments from
FBI-1 whole-length cDNA and inserting it into the retrovirus plasmid pBabe (Addgene, Cambridge, Mass). The
following oligonucleotide PCR primers were used:
forward, 50 -CAGTGAATTCACCATGGACTACAAG
GACGACGATGACAAGATGGCCGGCGGCGTGG
ACGGC-30 ; reverse, 50 -CAGTGTCGACTTAGGC
GAGTCCGGCTGTG AAGTTA-30 . In addition, the
following small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed to
knock down FBI-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) were
purchased from Genechem (Shanghai, China): FBI-1,
50 -GCUGGACCUUGUAGAUCAAtt-30 and 50 -UUG
AUCUACAAGGUCCAGCtt-30 ; negative control, 50 CCUACGCCACCAAUUUCGUtt-30 and 50 -ACGAA
AUUGGUGGCGUAGGtt-30 .

Packaging Virus and Infection
The pBabe-flag-FBI-1 or pBabe control plasmid was
transfected into 293T cells at 70% confluence together
with packaging plasmid GAG-pol and pCMV-VSV-G by
using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). The retrovirus-containing supernatants were collected after 72 hours. For infection, the media containing
retrovirus was added to the cells supplied with polybrene
(8 lg/mL) for 6 hours and then replaced with fresh medium. Then, after 12 hours, the infection was repeated.
Infected HepG2 cells were selected in the presence of puromycin (2 lg/mL) for 2 days, and puromycin-resistant
cells were plated for further study. The stable cell lines
were called HepG2þ FBI-1 cells and HepG2control cells.
For FBI-1 knockdown, siRNA (500 pmol/35mm dish)
was transfected into SMMC-7721 by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 hours, the cells
were harvested for further studies.
Growth Curves and Wound-Healing Assay
Methods for the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and wound-healing
assays have been described previously.27,28 These experiments were performed in triplicate.
Flow Cytometry
The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry at different
time points by using a propidium iodide (PI) cell cycle detection kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing,
China). The cells were harvested, treated, and stained with PI
according to the user’s manual. The cell cycle was detected by
using a flow cytometer (BD Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability was detected with the AlamarBlue cell viability
kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). First, cells were seeded in a
96-well cell culture plate (Corning Inc.) with 70% confluence, and the cells were cultured for 12 hours to allow them
to adhere. Then, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or doxorubicin
(Dox) was added to the medium with 1 lM final concentration separately. Twenty-four hours later, a 1:10 volume of
AlamarBlue reagent was added directly to the cells in culture
medium as described in the product manual. Then, the cells
were incubated for 4 hours at 37 C in a cell culture incubator (protected from direct light). Cell viability was calculated by detecting the fluorescence intensity (FI) with a
SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif). Cell viability as a percentage was expressed as
follows: cell viability (%) ¼ FItreatment/FIno treatment.

Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
Luciferase activity was assessed according to the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay protocol (Promega, Madison,
Wis) using a Veritas 96-well Microplate Luminometer
(Promega) with substrate dispenser (Promega). The p53
activity detection luciferase plasmid pGL3-p53 (firefly luciferase; Addgene) and control plasmid pRLTK (Renilla
luciferase; Addgene) were cotransfected into HepG2þ FBI-1
and HepG2control cells. Twelve hours later, 5-FU or Dox
was added to the medium to 1 lM final concentration,
and the cells were incubated for another 24 hours. Then,
the medium was removed, the cells were washed once
with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysis buffer (50 lL)
was added. A 10 lL sample was placed in each well of a
96-well plate; then, 50 lL Luciferase Assay Reagent II
(a substrate for firefly luciferase) were added to each well
by the luminometer, and the firefly activity was measured.
Then, we added 50 lL Stop and Glow (a stop solution for
firefly luciferase and a substrate for Renilla luciferase; the
Stop and Glow reagent was included in the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit [Promega]), and Renilla luciferase
activity was measured. The mean luciferase activity was
measured and was used to calculate ratios between firefly
and Renilla luciferase.

In Vivo Study
A xenografted mouse model of HCC was created by subcutaneous injection of 1  107 HepG2þ FBI-1 cells and
HepG2control cells into the left upper flank regions of 5 experimental mice (male BALB/c mice, ages 3-4 weeks). For
injection, the cells were resuspended in 0.2 mL Dulbecco
modified Eagle media medium. The HepG2þ FBI-1 and
HepG2control cell-xenografted mice were treated with 5FU (30 mg/kg; 5 days of intraperitoneal injection and 2
days of withdrawal; 2 courses over 14 days) or Dox (1 mg/
kg, orally administered once every 2 days for 18 days)
starting on Day 20 after tumor implantation.29,30 Then,
the mice were killed; and the tumors were enucleated,
fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut
into 4 lm-thick slices for hematoxylin and eosin staining.
The tumor size was calculated as follows: tumor volume
(mm3) ¼ (L  W2)/2, where L indicates the long axis,
and W indicates the short axis. The relative tumor volume
was calculated as follows: relative tumor volume (%) ¼
(volume of tumor tissue treated with 5-FU or Dox)/
(volume of tumor tissue treated without 5-FU or Dox).
The Animal Use Committee of the Xiangya Hospital
approved all protocols for treating animals.

Statistical Analysis
SPSS version 13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill)
was used for statistical analyses. The Fisher exact test was
used for statistical analysis of categorical data, and independent t tests were used to analyze continuous data. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier
method and were evaluated using the log-rank test. In
addition, a Cox proportional hazards regression model
was established to identify factors that were associated independently with overall survival. All tests were 2-tailed,
and P values <.05 were considered statistically significant.

analysis. HCC tissues expressed significantly higher FBI-1
mRNA levels than ANLTs, and the median elevated fold
induction was 4.5-fold (range, 1.2-fold to 13.0-fold)
(Fig. 1A). A classic semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis in
parallel confirmed the real-time PCR results (HCC vs
ANLT: 1.20  0.28 vs 0.45  0.12, respectively; P <
.001) (Fig. 1B,C). To determine whether the difference in
the mRNA levels was reflected at the protein level, we studies the same 34 paired specimens by using Western blot
analysis. Consistent with the mRNA expression results, the
FBI-1 protein expression levels also were significantly higher
in HCC tissues than that in the corresponding ANLTs
(0.95  0.20 vs 0.31  0.10; P < .001) (Fig. 1B,C).

nuclear expression is observed (A) in >51% of cancer cells (scored as 3þ), (B) in 26% to 50% of cancer cells (scored as 2þ), (C)
in 11% to 25% of cancer cells (scored as 1þ), and (D) in <10% of cancer cells (scored as 0þ). On the basis of these immunohistochemical staining results, patients were classified according to the level of FBI-1 expression into a low expression group (scored
as 0 or 1þ; n ¼ 45) and a high expression group (scored as 2þ or 3þ; n ¼ 84). (E,F) Log-rank tests indicated that patients with

samples (40%) scored 3þ, 35 samples (27.1%) scored
2þ, 28 samples (21.7%) scored 1þ, and 17 samples
(13.2%) scored 0. The representative positive immunostaining of HCC specimens is shown in Figure 2A-D.
The correlations between FBI-1 protein staining intensity
and clinicopathologic variables in patients with HCC
were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test (see Table
1). The results indicated that the up-regulation of FBI-1
protein expression was correlated strongly with multiple

grade (P ¼ .005). However, FBI-1 protein staining intensity was not related significantly to sex, age, preoperative
AFP level, hepatitis history, Child-Pugh score, cirrhosis,
tumor size, or venous invasion (P > .05) (Table 1).

low FBI-1 expression group (score, 0 or 1þ; n ¼ 45) and
a high FBI-1 expression group (score, 2þ or 3þ; n ¼ 84).
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the correlation between FBI-1 expression levels and the prognosis
of patients with HCC after hepatic resection. The results
indicated that patients with high FBI-1 expression had
shorter overall survival and disease-free survival than
patients with low FBI-1 expression (median overall survival, 300 days vs 720 days; P ¼ .008; median disease-free
survival, 150 days vs 450 days; P ¼ .002) (Fig. 2). To test
whether the FBI-1 expression level was an independent
prognostic factor for survival in patients with HCC, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used
to identify factors that may predict survival after hepatic
resection. The multivariate Cox regression analysis indi-

cated that low FBI-1 expression (relative risk [RR], 0.42;
P ¼ .015), higher Edmondson-Steiner grade (RR, 0.40;
P ¼ .010), and the presence of venous invasion (RR, 3.33;
P ¼ .001) were independent prognostic factors for
survival. The other clinicopathologic variables did not
add any independent prognostic information (Table 2).

To characterize the biologic roles of FBI-1, growth curves
were constructed and a wound-healing assay was performed as described above (see Materials and Methods).
The results indicated that HepG2þ FBI-1 cells grew much
faster than HepG2control cells (P < .05) (Fig. 3B), and
FBI-1 knock down significantly inhibited SMMC-7721
cell proliferation (P < .05) (Fig. 3C). However, no significant difference in migration was observed between these
cells (P > .05) (Fig. 3D).
FBI-1 Promotes Cell Proliferation by
Down-Regulating p27, p53, and p21
To highlight the potential mechanism by which FBI-1
regulates HCC cell proliferation, the cell cycle distribution of these cells was detected by flow cytometry. The
results indicated that FBI-1 overexpression could dramatically increase G2/M phase cell numbers (14.5% vs 1.3%;
P < .05) (Fig. 4A), and FBI-1 knock down consistently
decreased G2/M phase cell numbers (12% vs 22%; P <
.05) (Fig. 4B). On the basis of the finding that FBI-1
could regulate cell cycle progression, the expression levels
of some cell cycle-related proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. We observed that HepG2þ FBI-1 cells
and SMMC-7721control cells had significantly lower
expression levels of p27, p53, and p21 than the corresponding HepG2þ FBI-1 cells and SMMC-7721þ siRNA
cells, suggesting an inverse correlation between FBI-1 and
p27, p53, and p21 (Fig. 4C). These data indicated that
FBI-1-regulated cell proliferation may be controlled
through p27, p53 and p21.

FBI-1 Inhibits 5-FU-Induced or Dox-Induced
Cell Death by Suppressing the Activation of
p53
Because FBI-1 was able to regulate the expression of p53,
which plays a critical role in cell death, we hypothesized
that FBI-1 might play an important role in chemotherapy.
To verify this possibility, cells were treated with the most
commonly used chemotherapy reagents—5-FU (1 lM)
or Dox (1 lM)—and cell viability was detected by using
the AlamarBlue Cell Viability Kit (Invitrogen). The
results indicated that HepG2þ FBI-1 cells were much more
resistant to 5-FU-induced or Dox-induced cell death (5FU treatment group: 0.75  0.13 vs 0.53  0.10; P <
.05; Dox treatment group: 0.57  0.11 vs 0.25  0.05; P
< .05) (Fig. 5A), and SMMC-7721þ siRNA cells were
much more sensitive to 5-FU-induced or Dox-induced
cell death (5-FU treatment group: 035  0.08 vs 0.60 
0.12; P < .05; Dox treatment group: 0.20  0.04 vs 0.45
 0.07; P < .05) (Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assay results
indicated that the activation level of p53 in HepG2þ FBI-1
cells was significantly lower than that in HepG2control cells
(0.38  0.10 vs 0.99  0.15; P < .01); and, after 5-FU or
Dox treatment, p53 was activated significantly in HepG2control
cells (5-FU treatment: 1.95  0.35 vs 0.99  0.15;
P < .05; Dox treatment: 2.1  0.37 vs 0.99  0.15; P <
.01). However, the activation of p53 was repressed significantly in HepG2þ FBI-1 cells (5-FU treatment: 0.48 
0.12 vs 0.38  0.10; P > .05; Dox treatment: 0.73 
0.18 vs 0.38  0.10; P > .05) (Fig. 5C). Consistent with

that FBI-1 could decreased the expression of p53 and
inhibited its activation after 5-FU or Dox treatment
(Fig. 5D).

FBI-1 Promotes Cell Proliferation and
Enhances Chemotherapy Resistance of HCC
In Vivo
To validate the observations obtained from in vitro studies, we examined the in vivo relevance of the potential role
for FBI-1 in HCC tumorigenesis and chemotherapy in a
xenografted mouse model. We observed that the average
size of tumors in HepG2þ FBI-1 mice was dramatically
larger than those in HepG2control mice (1485  350 mm3
vs 648  130 mm3; P < .05), and tumors in the HepG2þ
FBI-1
mice were much more resistant to 5-FU or Dox
treatment than those in the HepG2control mice (relative
tumor volume: 5-FU treatment, 40% vs 24%; P < .05;
Dox treatment, 27% vs 10%; P < .05) (Fig. 6A). Hematoxylin and eosin staining also revealed that tumors in

Cancer

HepG2control mice had more cell death than those in
HepG2þ FBI-1 mice (Fig. 6B).

DISCUSSION
Recently, many studies have confirmed that FBI-1 is an
important proto-oncogene and is deregulated in many
cancers. Apostolopoulou et al observed prominent expression of FBI-1 in nonsmall cell lung cancerous areas compared with adjacent normal tissue elements and noted
that this was caused by gene amplification (2-fold to 5fold).22 Another study also indicated that, by comparing
the expression levels of FBI-1 in 20 human benign and
malignant breast biopsy tissues, the overall expression of
FBI-1 mRNA transcripts and total protein was significantly more in malignant breast tissues than in benign
breast tissues.24 However, the correlation between its
expression and clinicopathologic parameters or the prognosis of patients has not been documented, and the
expression profile and function of FBI-1 in HCC currently remain unknown. Given the accumulating evidence

and information, we hypothesized that FBI-1 also plays
an important role in HCC carcinogenesis. To clarify this
hypothesis, the current study was performed to investigate
the expression, clinical relevance, and biologic role of
FBI-1 in HCC.
In this study, first, we detected FBI-1 expression
profiles in HCC; then, we analyzed the correlations of its
expression with clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis in patients with HCC. Our data revealed that both
mRNA and protein levels of FBI-1 were highly elevated in
HCC tissues compared with levels in the corresponding
ANLTs. In addition, the up-regulation of FBI-1 protein
expression was strongly correlated with multiple tumor
nodes and higher Edmondson-Steiner grade, but not with
other clinicopathologic variables. On the basis of the well
known common sense that multiple tumor nodes and

144

poor cell differentiation are highly correlated with a poor
prognosis in patients with HCC,31,32 the value of FBI-1
in predicting the outcome of patients with HCC after hepatic resection also was evaluated. We observed that upregulated expression of FBI-1 was correlated with shorter
overall and tumor-free survival in patients with HCC. It is
noteworthy that the multivariate Cox regression analysis
indicated that FBI-1 expression, together with Edmondson-Steiner grade and venous invasion, was an independent prognostic factor for survival. These data suggest that
FBI-1 expression may serve as a novel prognostic marker
in patients with HCC.
Because of its valuable clinical relevance, we believed
that FBI-1 plays an important role in the development
and progression of HCC, which subsequently was verified
in our in vitro and in vivo studies. Our data indicated that

Cancer

Oncogenic role of FBI-1 in HCC/Fang et al

FBI-1 can regulate the proliferation, but not the migration, of HCC cells through p27, p53, and p21, which are
involved in the initiation and development of HCC.33,34
p27Kip1 is a member of the CIP/KIP family that can
cause G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the activities of G1
cyclin–cyclin-dependent kinases. Thus, as a negative regulator of the cell cycle, p27Kip1 is overexpressed in the
early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating that this
parameter may be a useful diagnostic marker for precancerous lesions and early HCC.33 In the current study, we
confirmed that FBI-1 is capable of decreasing p27 expression, suggesting that FBI-1 up-regulation may be an early
event in HCC carcinogenesis. The tumor suppressor p53,
which is a key regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis,
is always inactivated or mutated in human cancers.35,36
However, Teramoto et al observed that p53 mutation is a
late event and occurs in only 30% of HCC grade III tissues.37 So, we image that FBI-1, together with other p53
regulation networks, can lead to the inactivation of p53 in
early stage HCC. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p21 is regulated by p53-dependent and p53-independent
pathways. Choi et al observed that FBI-1 acts as a transcriptional repressor of p21 by binding to the distal p53responsive elements of the p21 promoter,18 and we
believe that further investigations are needed to determine
whether the down-regulation of p21 by FBI-1 is p53-dependent or p53-independent. FBI-1 also can repress the
expression of ARF and Rb by directly binding to their
promoter; however, no distinct change was observed in
our study. This may be because of differences in the caner
type.
In the current study, we also investigated the role of
FBI-1 in chemotherapy. The results indicated that FBI-1
can inhibit cell death induced by 5-FU or Dox by suppressing the activation of p53. Finally, our in vivo studies
of a mouse xenograft model validated the observations
obtained from our in vitro studies. Consistent with the in
vitro results, FBI-1 was able to promote cell proliferation
and enhance chemotherapy resistance to 5-FU or Dox in
vivo. On the basis of its biologic function, these results
indicated that suppressing the expression of FBI-1 can inhibit cell proliferation and increase the sensitivity of HCC
to chemotherapy, which can serve as a new therapeutic
strategy to treat HCC. Indeed, a recent study indicated
that curcumin may inhibit cell proliferation in human
lung cancer cells by decreasing the expression of FBI-1.38
In summary, the current study demonstrated that
proto-oncogene FBI-1 levels were highly elevated in
HCC, and the overexpression of FBI-1 was correlated

Cancer

January 1, 2012

with a poor prognosis in patients with HCC, promoted
cell proliferation, and enhanced chemotherapy resistance
of HCC in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that
FBI-1 may serve as a novel prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for HCC.
