Ablation of TAK1 Upregulates Reactive Oxygen Species
and Selectively Kills Tumor Cells
Emily Omori1, Kunihiro Matsumoto2, Songyun Zhu1, Robert C. Smart1, and Jun Ninomiya-Tsuji1

Abstract
TAK1 kinase activates multiple transcription factors and regulates the level of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). We have previously reported that ablation of TAK1 in keratinocytes causes hypersensitivity to ROSinduced cell apoptosis. It is known that some tumor cells produce ROS at higher levels compared with normal
cells. We used inducible epidermal-specific TAK1 knockout mice and examined whether ablation of TAK1 in
preexisting skin tumors could cause an increase in ROS and result in tumor cell death. Deletion of tak1 gene in
skin tumors caused the accumulation of ROS and increased apoptosis, and skin tumors totally regressed within 5 to 10 days. Normal skin did not exhibit any significant abnormality on tak1 gene deletion. Thus, TAK1 kinase
could be a new and effective molecular target for ROS-based tumor killing. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8417–25. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
TAK1 is a member of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) kinase kinase (MAPKKK) and is an indispensable
signaling intermediate in several MAPK and NF-κB pathways
(1–3). In mouse models, TAK1 is found to be essential for
immune cell differentiation and activation by mediating activation of MAPK and NF-κB (4–7). In epithelial cells, we
have shown that TAK1 is critically involved in cell survival
and that ablation of TAK1 upregulates tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)–induced epithelial cell death (8–10). Ablation of TAK1
signaling diminishes activation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways, and decreases antioxidant capacity (9). Reactive oxygen
species (ROS) accumulation and apoptosis are observed on
TNF stimulation in cultured TAK1-deficient epidermal cells
(keratinocytes; ref. 9).
Cells constantly generate ROS as byproducts of energy metabolism through the electron transport chain reactions in
mitochondria. Environmental factors such as commensal
bacteria and stressors can additionally upregulate ROS generation in the cells. Thus, cellular antioxidant systems including TAK1 pathway are thought to be required for protecting
cells from ROS-induced cell damage. Indeed, ablation of
TAK1 spontaneously causes severe tissue damage in the intestinal epithelium (8). Neonatal mice having epidermalspecific constitutive deletion of TAK1 also exhibit severe skin
damage (10). Thus, the TAK1 pathway is important for cell

survival for some epithelial tissues. In contrast, adult mice
having inducible epidermal-specific deletion of TAK1 exhibit
mild tissue damage and moderately elevated apoptosis on
tak1 gene deletion (9). Cultured TAK1-deficient fibroblasts
and keratinocytes grow normally and do not exhibit significantly increased ROS (9). Thus, under the standard tissue
culture conditions as well as in the adult skin, the TAK1
pathway is not always required for cell survival.
It is well known that tumor cells produce ROS at higher
levels compared with normal cells because tumors have increased energy metabolism and other abnormalities such as
oncogenic stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are
associated with increased ROS production (11). Because of
the increased intracellular levels of ROS, some tumor cells
are hypersensitive to oxidative stress (12–14). However, tumor cells often upregulate cellular levels of antioxidant to
counteract increased ROS levels (15). By decreasing the cellular antioxidant capacity in tumor cells, the increased levels
of endogenous ROS production could result in tumor cell
death. We hypothesized that ablation of TAK1 would decrease cellular antioxidant capacity in tumors, cause increased levels of ROS, and kill tumor cells. In this study, we
tested the hypothesis that TAK1 ablation selectively kills
tumor cells via ROS in a skin tumor model.

Materials and Methods
Mice
TAK1-floxed (TAK1flox/flox) mice were from Dr. Akira (Osaka
University; ref. 6). K14-CreERT mice were obtained from The
Jackson Laboratory (16). Mice harboring an epidermal-specific
inducible TAK1 deletion (K14-CreERT TAK1flox/flox) were generated, and tak1 gene deletion was examined by PCR as
described previously (9). Littermate controls were used in
all experiments. All animal experiments were done with the
approval of the North Carolina State University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.

T24 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC; HBT-4) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum (Hyclone) and penicillinstreptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2. Less than six times passaged
T24 cells after purchase were used. ATCC characterized the
cells by using isoenzymology and/or the cytochrome c subunit
I PCR assay and short tandem repeat analyses. Reagents used
were tamoxifen (MP) 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene
(DMBA; Acros), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA;
LC Laboratories), 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (17), Bouin fixation fluid
(EMD), anti–poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Cell Signaling), and anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Abcam).

200 nmol DMBA followed 1 week later with three treatments
each week of 5 nmol TPA for 19 to 27 weeks (18). All agents
were applied in 200 μL acetone. For a tumor regression assay,
TPA treatment was terminated and 0.5 to 1 mg/mouse tamoxifen was i.p. injected for 5 consecutive days. The fifth
day of tamoxifen injection is designated as day 0. To test
the effect of TAK1 inhibition in skin papilloma development,
CD1 mice were given a single application of 200 nmol DMBA
followed 1 week later with twice-weekly treatment of acetone +
5 nmol TPA or 100 nmol 5Z-7-oxozeaenol + 5 nmol TPA for
25 weeks. TPA was administered 30 minutes after acetone
or 5Z-7-oxozeaenol treatment.

Results and Discussion
Ablation of TAK1 causes regression of skin
tumors in vivo
Mice having constitutive epidermal-specific deletion of
TAK1 (K5-Cre TAK1flox/flox) develop severe skin damage at
neonatal days 5 to 7 and are lethal around postnatal days 7
to 8 (10). We have found that this damage is blocked by deletion of TNF receptor 1 gene (TNFR1−/−). TNF is constantly
expressed at some levels in the normal skin, and when TAK1
is ablated, TNF upregulates ROS, resulting in apoptosis
(9, 10). By using an inducible epidermal-specific gene deletion system (K14-CreERT TAK1flox/flox), we have examined
the role of TAK1-ROS pathway in adult mouse skin. In adult
mice, TAK1 deficiency modestly increases apoptosis; however, it does not cause severe skin damage as observed in
the neonatal TAK1 mutant mice. Therefore, TAK1 is important but not critically involved in cell survival in the normal
adult epidermis. We then asked whether epidermal-derived
tumor cells in vivo are more sensitive to TAK1 ablation.
We used inducible epidermal-specific TAK1 knockout (K14CreERT TAK1flox/flox) mice and examined the effect of TAK1
deletion in preexisting epidermal-derived tumors. Skin tumors
were induced by initiation with DMBA and promotion with
TPA (18). tak1 gene deletion was induced by 5-consecutiveday treatment of 0.5 to 1 mg/mouse/day tamoxifen. This treatment regimen induced tak1 gene deletion in both tumors and
normal regions of the skin (Fig. 1A) and did not cause extensive apoptosis in the normal epidermis (Fig. 2B). We performed four independent experiments, and all skin tumors
on K14-CreERT TAK1 flox/flox mice disappeared within 5 to
13 days after tamoxifen treatment (n = 20; Fig. 1B and C;
Table 1). In comparison, few tumors regressed in tamoxifentreated control TAK1flox/flox mice (n = 14; Fig. 1B and C; Table 1).
TAK1-deleted tumors started regressing at 3 days after the
completion of tamoxifen treatment (day 3). Histologic analysis revealed that TAK1-deficient tumors contained large
numbers of cells having fragmented nuclei (Fig. 2A) and exhibited extensive apoptosis (Fig. 2B) at days 3 to 6. In comparison,
no pronounced increased apoptosis or tissue damages were
observed in normal skin (Fig. 2A and B). TAK1-deficient tumors lost cellularity starting from day 6 (Fig. 2A, bottom).
These results show that ablation of TAK1 is selectively cytotoxic to epidermal-derived tumors.
Cell proliferation is not affected by ablation of TAK1
To determine the mechanism by which ablation of TAK1
causes tumor regression, we examined whether ablation of
TAK1 impairs tumor cell proliferation. BrdUrd incorporation
was examined in control and TAK1-deficient epidermis
in mice with skin tumors. Cell proliferation was not altered

by TAK1 deletion in tumors or normal epidermis (Fig. 3).
This indicates that the TAK1 pathway is not important for
tumor cell proliferation, and that the cause of tumor regression is not due to impaired cell proliferation.
ROS is upregulated in TAK1-deficient skin tumors
We have previously shown that TAK1–c-Jun pathway regulates the levels of ROS in keratinocytes (9). To further investigate the mechanism by which TAK1 regulates antioxidant
capacity in keratinocytes, we examined the expression levels
of several cellular antioxidant genes with and without TNF
stimulation (Fig. 4A). Among the antioxidant genes we examined, the mRNA levels of NQO1, glutathione S-transferases
(GSTM1 and GSTP1), and GCLC were reduced by TAK1

ablation in both unstimulated and TNF-stimulated keratinocytes. However, other antioxidant genes such as manganese
superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) were found to be unchanged
by TAK1 ablation (9). Thus, ablation of TAK1 downregulates
the levels of a subset of cellular antioxidant genes and lowers
cellular antioxidant capacity in keratinocytes. We attempted
to analyze the levels of the above cellular antioxidant genes in
tumors; however, we were unable to obtain enough RNA from
TAK1-deficient tumors because the tumors were highly
apoptotic. We anticipate that the ablation of TAK1 reduces antioxidant capacity in tumors as observed in normal keratinocytes, and that the ROS levels might be higher in tumors due to
increased production of ROS in tumor cells. We tested the
levels of ROS in skin tumors by staining with the ROS-reactive

samples were harvested, and frozen sections
were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis
using anti-BrdUrd antibody in tumors or normal
region of the skin (nt). Scale bar, 40 μm. The
analysis was done in two independent
experiments, and photomicrographs of
representative images of tumors and normal
regions are shown. BrdUrd-positive cells

with tak1 gene deletion or tumors in control mice exhibited
only marginal or no accumulation of ROS compared with
the control normal skin in TAK1flox/flox mice (Fig. 4B). Tumors
harvested before tak1 gene deletion did not exhibit ROS accumulation (Fig. 4C), indicating that increased ROS was caused
by tak1 gene deletion. These results are consistent with the

idea that the ablation of TAK1 in tumor cells reduces their
antioxidant capacity resulting in increased ROS, which causes
tumor cell apoptosis.

in T24 cells
Our results thus far show that skin tumor regression is
correlated with TAK1 deficiency-dependent apoptosis. To

further verify whether ablation of TAK1 can directly kill tumor cells, we used cultured cells. DMBA-TPA skin tumors are
highly associated with oncogenic mutations in Ras, specifically in H-Ras (18–20). We therefore examined whether
TAK1 deficiency can cause apoptosis in a tumor cell line
having the H-Ras oncogenic mutation. We used T24 tumor
cell line, which possesses the oncogenic H-Ras G12V mutation, and tested the effect of TAK1 knockdown. Nontarget
siRNA and two different siRNAs against human TAK1
(siTAK1#2 and siTAK1#3) were transfected into T24 cells,
and cells were treated with apoptosis inducers TNF and
TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand). Caspase activation was analyzed by cleavage of PARP, and Annexin V
binding was also analyzed. In control siRNA–treated T24 cells,

TRAIL slightly increased cleaved PARP and Annexin V binding,
whereas TNF had no effect (Fig. 5A–C). TAK1 siRNA
(siTAK1#2) reduced the levels of TAK1 (Fig. 5A, right) and increased cleaved PARP on TNF and TRAIL treatment (Fig. 5A).
siTAK1#2 also slightly increased Annexin V binding (Fig. 5C).
The other TAK1 siRNA (siTAK1#3) effectively reduced the level
of TAK1 and highly increased cleaved PARP and Annexin V
binding (Fig. 5B and C). We note that we observed morphologic changes consistent with apoptotic cells (shrinking cells)
in T24 cells expressing siTAK1#3 even in the absence of
TNF or TRAIL, and we could detect cleaved PARP in unstimulated cells (Fig. 5B, most left lane). These results indicate that
the level of TAK1 is correlated with resistance to apoptosis
in tumor cells having H-Ras mutation.

CD1 mice (n = 10 for each treatment) were

DMBA followed 1 wk later with twice weekly
treatment of 5 nmol TPA for 25 wk. Control
vehicle (acetone) or 100 nmol 5Z-7-oxozeaenol
was administered topically 30 min before every
TPA treatment. A, the number of mice having
tumors (>1 mm) was counted every week. P =

B, the total numbers of tumors at 25 wk of TPA
treatment were analyzed. 5Z-7-oxozeaenol
treatment alone without DMBA or TPA did not
induce skin papilloma or any skin abnormality.

A selective TAK1 inhibitor downregulates skin
tumor development
We also wanted to examine whether ablation of TAK1
could block tumor development. However, we found that induction of tak1 gene deletion together with the tumor promoter
TPA treatment caused a severe inflammatory condition in
normal epidermis, which precluded the use of these mice.
We speculated that complete deletion of TAK1 strongly enhances TPA-induced inflammation. We therefore chose to
use a selective TAK1 inhibitor, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (17), which
partially blocks TAK1 activity. We examined whether inhibition of TAK1 activity could reduce tumor development in
DMBA-TPA mouse skin tumor models (Fig. 6). After the initiation of tumors by DMBA treatment, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol or vehicle was applied to the skin 30 minutes before each TPA
treatment. The tumor incidence was not significantly altered
by 5Z-7-oxozeaenol treatment (Fig. 6A). However, 10 mice
with vehicle treatment developed total 160 tumors at
25 weeks, whereas only 71 was observed in 10 mice with 5Z7-oxozeaenol treatment (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that
inhibition of TAK1 kinase may inhibit tumor development
at least in the mouse skin tumor model. Although these results
raise the possibility that the TAK1 inhibitor may be useful to
treat tumors, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol is a selective but not specific inhibitor of TAK1, which may cause side effects. We note here that
treatment of preexisting tumors with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol did not
alter the size of tumors, suggesting that a stronger inhibition of
TAK1 may be required for regression of preexisting tumors.
Highly proliferating cells such as tumor cells produce more

in the respiratory chain, and balance the ROS levels by upregulating cellular antioxidant capacity. TAK1 ablation-mediated
reduction of cellular antioxidant capacity highly affects tumors, which results in the selective killing of tumor cells.
TAK1 is an essential intermediate activating transcription
factor of NF-κB and AP1, and both are involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes associated with cell
survival (21–23). NF-κB and AP1 regulate antiapoptotic genes
and cellular antioxidant genes. Therefore, it is likely that
TAK1 regulation of both NF-κB and AP1 plays a central role
in tumor cell survival not only by reducing ROS but also by
inducing antiapoptotic genes. Approaches to inhibit TAK1
signaling might provide a new avenue of cancer therapy.
