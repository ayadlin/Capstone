ABSTRACT
We have previously shown that Met activation through the hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) increases tumorogenesis, induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and chemoresistance in SCLC. We sought to evaluate circulating HGF levels in
SCLC patients and assess correlation with outcome and EMT features in the tumor.
Serum samples from patients with SCLC were prospectively obtained at diagnosis,
response evaluation and progression. HGF serum (sHGF) was quantified by ELISA. EMT
markers and p-Met/Met were assayed by immunohistochemistry in tumor samples.
Clinical data were prospectively recorder. One-hundred twelve patients were included.
High baseline levels of sHGF were associated with shorter overall survival (p=0.007)
and remained independently associated with survival in the multivariate analysis
(p=0.016). For stage IV patients, an increase of sHGF levels at response evaluation
(p=0.042) and at progression (p=0.003) were associated with poor outcome. sHGF
levels were associated (p<0.05) with a mesenchymal phenotype in the tumor. In
conclusion, high sHGF at diagnosis and increases during the course of the disease
predict for poor outcome in SCLC patients and associate with EMT in the tumor. These
data provide novel evidence on a role of sHGF in the adverse clinical behavior of SCLC
and support testing Met inhibitors in patients with high sHGF.

been identified with potential therapeutic interest [2-4].
However, no targeted treatment has been successful to
date in improving the outcome of patients. Outcome in
advance stage remains poor with a median overall survival
that does not exceed one year with available treatments

Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly lethal
disease and accounts for approximately 15% of patients
with lung cancers[1]. Many genetic alterations have

[5]. The research of novel targets for selected patient
populations in this disease is therefore urgently needed.
Met is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase
that is overexpressed in many solid tumors and has been
associated with poor outcome. Hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF) is the high affinity natural ligand of Met and
upon binding to the receptor, it triggers dimerization of
the receptor and downstream signaling. Aberrant Met
activation through HGF (autocrine or paracrine effects)
or genetic mechanisms (mutation, amplification) is
associated with increased motility, migration, invasion
and angiogenesis in several tumor models[6-8]. A number
of Met inhibitors are in development at the moment with
promising results in solid tumors[9].
We have previously reported that Met activation
as assayed by phosphorylated Met (p-Met) expression
is associated with decreased survival in SCLC[10]. We
have also shown in preclinical SCLC models that HGF
induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
that results in increased tumorogenesis, invasiveness
and chemoresistance. The potential clinical relevance of
this finding was further suggested by the ability of Met
inhibition, achieved by the Alk/Met inhibitor crizotinib,
to re-sensitize mesenchymal SCLC tumor xenografts to
chemotherapy. In human SCLC samples we have also
observed an association between Met activation and
mesenchymal markers (vimentin, Snail1, SPARC) and
poor outcome. Furthermore, mesenchymal features were
upregulated in relapsed, chemorefractory disease [11].
Studies have also shown an association between EMT
features in the tumor and outcome for NSCLC[12]. These
data provide rational to consider clinical trials combining
chemotherapy with Met inhibitors in SCLC patients with
a mesenchymal/Met activated phenotype.
The hypothesis of the present work was that
circulating HGF would be a clinically useful surrogate
marker of EMT and Met phenotype in SCLC and therefore
correlate with patient outcome. Serum HGF (sHGF) has
been associated with prognosis in several tumors [13-16],
and response/resistance to therapies [17-19]. Ultimately, if
this were the case in SCLC, then it could be considered as
a potential biomarker for defining a population to be tested
with Met inhibitors.
Peripheral blood and its components (serum,
plasma, and circulating cells) provide a non-invasive
medium to evaluate biomarkers in a more convenient way
for patients compared to a lung biopsy. It also allows for
serial determinations of the biomarker and correlation with
treatment effects.

RESULTS
SCLC patients have higher HGF serum levels
when compared to healthy subjects
We included 112 SCLC patients in this study.
Patients’ characteristics are shown in Table 1. As observed,
the majority were male, current smokers with good
performance status (PS). The metastatic locations were as
expected with a majority of patients having liver and bone
disease. First line treatment was standard chemotherapy
with a higher percentage of patients receiving carboplatin
(70%) in combination with etoposide. Patients that were
considered unfit for treatment underwent best supportive
care. This particular group of patients (N: 9) were
characterized by poor PS (2-4) and only had the baseline
sHGF sample.
As differences between serum and plasma levels of
HGF have been reported we first analyzed 26 cases with
both types of samples. Supplementary figure 1 shows the
correlation between both types of samples with higher
levels found in serum as expected [20, 21].
We then collected serum from 30 healthy volunteers
matched to the study population by smoking status, gender
and age. sHGF levels were variable in healthy subjects
ranging from 792 to 1618 pg/ml, with a median sHGF
of 1131 pg/ml. sHGF levels for SCLC patients (N:104)
at diagnosis were significantly higher than in healthy
volunteers with a median of 1886 pg/ml (p<0.001). The
range of levels was greater in patients showing values
from 816 to 15629 pg/ml(Figure 1A).

* sHGF levels <=1886.10 pg/ml; ** sHGF levels >1886.10 pg/ml
Next, we evaluated if sHGF was associated with any
of the clinical variables. We found a significant association
between higher sHGF and worse PS (2-4) (p=0.002),
and presence of liver metastases (p=0.006). This was
consistent when we evaluated sHGF as a continuous
variable or dichotomous divided by the median (1886pg/
ml).

The fact of not receiving treatment was also significantly
associated with poorer survival. Within stage IV patients,
no differences were observed between patients receiving
cisplatin or carboplatin. Regarding location of metastases,
those with pleural (p=0.059) or liver metastases (p=0.002)
showed decreased survival.
We next evaluated the impact of sHGF levels
at baseline on outcome of these patients. Patients’
characteristics in both sHGF high and sHGF low groups
are shown in Table 3. Higher levels of sHGF were
associated with worse survival when analyzed as both
continuous or as discrete variable (median as the cut-off).
Figure 2A shows the Kaplan-Meier curve for survival
depending on sHGF levels (Table 2). Increases in 1000 pg/
ml were associated with a HR: 1.28 (1.14-1.42) (p<0.001)
of dying. This association was also significant when
analyzing only stage IV patients (HR: 1.29 (1.14-1.46),
p= 0.001).
In addition, we also performed the analysis
excluding those patients that did not receive treatment,
that included all patients with PS:4 (and thus would not
be eligible for any therapy, including the suggested Met
inhibitors). Again, those patients with sHGF above the
median showed a statistically significant worse survival
than those with lower sHGF (7.9 months vs 14.8 months,
respectively; p=0.023).
We then performed a multivariate analysis including
all significant variables in univariate analysis. Table 4
shows the results of the Cox regression model with the
variables that remained independently associated with OS.
As observed, higher sHGF levels were associated with
survival in this model as well as poor PS, former smoking
history, advanced stage, the presence of pleural metastases
and the lack of treatment.
Then we evaluated if changes of sHGF during
treatment were associated with OS. We selected stage

sHGF levels change longitudinally in patients with
SCLC undergoing chemotherapy
Figure 1B illustrates sHGF levels at diagnosis
(N:104) when compared to sHGF at response evaluation
(N:72) and at first progression (N:51). At response
evaluation, after 2-3 cycles of chemotherapy, in 78% of the
cases sHGF showed a decrease. sHGF levels at this point
were significantly lower than at baseline with a median of
1555pg/ml (p<0.001). Moreover, at first clinically detected
progression, 58% patients showed increase of sHGF from
the response evaluation time point (p=0.072) and 48%
if compared to baseline (p=0.76). The median value at
progression was 1607pg/ml. Changes for each individual
patient are plotted in Figure 1C.

sHGF levels at diagnosis and changes during
treatment have an impact in prognosis
We assessed the impact of all clinical variables on
survival in univariate analysis. Median follow up for the
series was 7.2 months (0.1-166.4). Table 2 illustrates the
association between clinical variables and OS. Median
overall survival for the whole series was 9.5 months.
Increasing age (p=0.002), poor PS, and former smoking
history were associated with decreased survival (Table 2).

IV patients because treatment (chemotherapy alone) and
outcomes were more homogeneous in this subgroup.
Patients who had a decrease of sHGF from baseline to
response evaluation presented a longer OS (9.5months)
compared to those that experimented an increase in
sHGF at this time point (7.3months) (p: 0.042) (Figure
2B). Moreover, those patients whose sHGF levels
increased from baseline to progression presented shorter
survival (8.9 months) vs those whose sHGF was lower at
progression (15.2 months) (p: 0.003) (Figure 2C).
In order to investigate the potential associations
between sHGF levels and response with the impact in
survival, we evaluated the association of sHGF levels
and its changes with tumor response. We had available
information on response to treatment in 89 patients.
From these, 6 (7%) patients showed complete response,
75 (84%) partial response, 5 (6%) stable disease and 3
(3%) progression. These categories were not associated
with overall survival in a statistically significant manner,
although numerically, patients who responded doubled OS

compared to those who did not (p=0.194) (Table 2). No
significant correlation was found between response and
baseline sHGF levels (median sHGF levels in responders:
1793pg/ml vs non-responders: 1917pg/ml). Moreover,
sHGF variations during treatment (i.e. increase or
decrease at response evaluation and progression) were not
associated with response either. These observations may
be related to the very high percentage of responders in
these series.

Serum HGF levels correlate with EMT phenotype
in the tumor
For a subset of the study population we had enough
available tumor samples for tumor biomarker analysis. We
had previously shown the induction of EMT through Met
activation via HGF in SCLC models and the prognostic
impact of these markers in human SCLC [23]. Thus we
tested the association between sHGF levels and these

SCLC remains one of the neoplasms with less
available efficacious treatments, leading to early death of
the majority of patients. Many studies are being conducted
with targeted therapies, however correlative biomarker
studies are still lacking in the majority of the cases. Our
study shows an independent role of serum HGF levels in
predicting outcome in patients with SCLC. Patients with
higher sHGF had shortened survival and an incremental
risk for death was found with increasing levels of sHGF at
diagnosis. Importantly, sHGF levels were associated with
a mesenchymal phenotype in the tumors, a finding that is
consistent with prior reports on the ability of the HGF/Met
receptor system to induce an epithelial to mesenchymal
transition. These results are consistent with a biological
relevance of circulating HGF and add to previous evidence
supporting the potential role of Met in this lethal disease.
Here we show that sHGF levels in SCLC patients
were able to discriminate patients with poor prognosis
upfront in line with reports in other tumors[16]. Moreover,
changes of serum levels during treatment also predicted
for outcome in our series of SCLC patients. The fact that
the majority of patients had a decrease of sHGF levels at
response evaluation (where the majority of patients do
actually respond to treatment) supports the hypothesis of
HGF being secreted, at least in part, by tumor cells in an
autocrine manner, as described in other tumor models[25].

tumor markers. We were able to assess these markers in
43 cases for vimentin and Snail1, 44 for SPARC, and
p-Met, and 45 for Met and E-cadherin. Some (N:25) of
these cases were included in our previous publication[11].
The percentage of positive cases for each marker is shown
in Supplementary Table 1. These results are consistent
with our previous work showing around 20-30% of SCLC
tumors staining for p-Met, vimentin, Snail1 and SPARC
and around 50% of cases considered overexpressed
(median as cut-off) for Met and E-cadherin. Interestingly,
we observed a significant association between increased
baseline levels of sHGF (above the median) and Snail1
(p=0.008), vimentin (p=0.038), SPARC (p=0.049)
expression and lack of E-cadherin expression (p=0.011).
P-Met expression showed a trend towards association
with sHGF expression but it did not reach statistical
significance (p=0.069) (Figure 3).

We have previously demonstrated that SCLC cell lines are
able to secrete HGF and this leads to a more mesenchymal
phenotype. This would be concordant to what we observe
in the current clinical study.
One caveat of the study is that we cannot rule out
the predictive role of sHGF in regards to chemotherapy
over a prognostic value (lacking a placebo arm as control).
We have analyzed specifically the association between
tumor response and sHGF levels but we did not find a
significant association. Therefore, the predictive role of
sHGF regarding chemotherapy response does not seem to
be the explanation for the association with patient survival.
A potential implication of our results is in helping to
select patients for clinical trials with anti-Met therapies,
where the need of predictive biomarker is urgent. Trials
with anti-Met therapies have selected patients based on
Met immunohistochemistry with an arbitrary cut-off
[26]. Although this is a practical approach to conduct a
trial that enriches for a population potentially sensitive
to anti-Met treatment, it is likely insufficient to optimally
select Met sensitive patients. This may help to explain
median survival figures around 12 months [26], different
from what we find in other target driven tumors where
sensitive patients are clearly defined (i.e. EGFR, ALK)
[27, 28]. Furthermore, there are examples of Met driven
tumors with nice responses to anti-Met therapies. Met
amplification seems to be up to date, the best predictor of
response to Met inhibitors [29-31]. However, evaluation of
copy number changes by FISH is challenging in SCLC due
to the typical crushing phenomenon of these tumors and
was not feasible in our hands[32]. In a case more relevant
to our discussion high sHGF levels appeared to select
anti-Met sensitive tumors. In this report, a patient with
gastric cancer that exhibited one of the highest baseline
circulating HGF from a series of patients treated in a
phase I trial with onartuzumab, experienced a complete
and durable response [33]. Of note, this was the only
patient in the phase I study that had a rapid and sustained
decrease in sHGF during anti-Met treatment [20]. This
preliminary clinical information, together with extensive
preclinical data, raise the hypothesis that selecting patients
with ‘active’ Met pathway may improve the efficacy of
anti-Met therapies.
It could be argued that the definition of “high”
or “low” sHGF based on a unique study is difficult to
extrapolate or to incorporate in the clinical practice as a
prognostic/predictive factor. Circulating HGF is composed
by different isoforms of HGF with differences in their
functions [34, 35]. Moreover, differences in sHGF levels
according to the detection technique are observed in SCLC
studies [22, 36]. Taken together, choosing a cut-off to
classify patients as bad prognosis or to select patients for
Met inhibitor trials needs further validation with detection
techniques that are reproducible and that are predefined in
the conception of these trials. However, what seems to be
consistent is that increasing levels of HGF are associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with worse survival and may potentially be defining a
population of patients with tumors more dependent on
Met.
A relevant finding in our study is that, despite the
limited number of cases, there was clear association
between sHGF levels and mesenchymal biomarkers in the
tumor. We have previously shown that p-Met expression is
associated with poor survival in SCLC. We subsequently
demonstrated that p-Met was co-expressed with EMT
markers such as Snail1 and vimentin and these were
independently associated with survival. In preclinical
models we and others have shown that HGF was able
to induce a mesenchymal phenotype (Snail1, SPARC,
vimentin expression, E-cadherin absence)[11, 37]. The
impact on prognosis of these markers was not evaluated
due to the limited sample size.
The clinical data that we present here supports the
ability of a sHGF to predict for a mesenchymal status of
the tumor, which is associated to Met activation. And this
is of upmost potential importance to select these patients
for clinical trials with anti-Met therapies and monitor
response. Of practical importance, a serum biomarker
would be predictive of the status of the tumor and make
clinical decisions possible based on a blood test. However,
in our study p-Met expression did not statistically correlate
with sHGF status, although there was a clear trend
(p=0.069). We believe this could be due to the limited
sample size.
Although the HGF/MET pathway seems to be
relevant itself in the biology of a subset of SCLCs,
cross-talk between the Met receptor and other receptors,
such as EGFR or VEGFR has been described [38-40].
Moreover, TK receptor ligands are associated with cancer
biology, EMT and progression. As preliminary studies, we
explored in these samples circulating levels of some of
these ligands at different time points (response assessment
and progression). In a subset of these patients, we were
able to detect EGF, angiopoietin and VEGF B, C in the
serum and more importantly these changed at response
and progression (data not shown). These studies are now
being completed in the whole series and will be included
in another publication.
In summary, we believe that results presented here
along with other preclinical and clinical data support the
evaluation of Met inhibitors in a selected subpopulation of
SCLC patients identified by high sHGF.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients and serum samples
This study was an observational study with no
intervention. Patients diagnosed with SCLC in our
institution were prospectively included. The inclusion

criteria were to have a cytohistological diagnosis of
SCLC and to sign the informed consent to participate in
the study. The first patient was included in January 2010
and the last patient in July 2013. The sample size was
calculated based on the assumption that patients with low
sHGF would have a 60% 1-year survival and those with
high sHGF a 30% (including 10% losses to follow up).
Taken these assumptions, 94 patients were necessary to
detect differences with 80% statistical power and 0.05
alpha error.
This project was approved by the Local Ethics
committee in our institution.
As a control population, we obtained serum samples
from age- and sex-matched healthy donors (N: 30) to the
study population.
Serum samples from SCLC patients were obtained
at diagnosis before starting treatment. All patients that
were amenable for treatment received standard first line
chemotherapy with a combination of platinum (carboplatin
or cisplatin) and etoposide at standard doses. Those
patients with stage III or less disease received concomitant
radiotherapy with radical intent. All patients with
responsive disease subsequently received prophylactic
cranial irradiation.
Subsequently, blood samples were obtained at
response evaluation (after 3 cycles of chemotherapy for
stage IV patients and after chemoradiation for stage III
or less). Moreover, at first clinically detected progression,
blood samples were collected from patients when
available. Patients with at least two samples of serum in
two different time points were included in the study.
All clinical and pathologic data was prospectively
included in a specific database. Follow up data was also
included with a final cut-off point at November 2013.
Previous observations [20, 21] have showed that
serum HGF level were significantly higher than the plasma
levels. Therefore, for a subset of cases we also obtained
plasma samples for comparison.
Serum and plasma blood samples were collected
using serum separator tubes (SST) and anticoagulant
(EDTA)-coated tubes, respectively. Samples were allowed
to clot for 30 minutes before centrifugation for 10 minutes
at 1000 g at 4ºC. Serum or plasma was removed and
assayed immediately or aliquoted and stored at -20ºC,
according to the protocol (SHG00 Quantikine Human
HGF Immunoassay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

diluent, pipetted into the wells and incubated for 2 hours
at room temperature. Any HGF present is bound by the
immobilized antibody. After washing away any unbound
substances, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific
for HGF is added to the wells and incubated for 2 hours
at room temperature. Following a wash to remove any
unbound antibody-enzyme reagent, a substrate solution
is added to the wells and color develops in proportion to
the amount of HGF bound in the initial step. The color
development is stopped with 2N Sulphuric Acid and the
intensity of the color is measured. The optical density of
each sample was determined using a microplate reader set
at 450 nm. Wavelength correction was set to 540 nm. HGF
concentrations were extrapolated from the standard curve
generated using the recombinant human HGF of the assay.
All samples were run in duplicates.

Tumor samples and immunohistochemistry
From a subset of patients we were able to analyze
by immunohistochemistry in the primary tumor several
markers (EMT and p-Met) to study their association with
HGF serum levels. Tumor specimens were retrospectively
retrieved from Parc de Salut Mar Biobank (MARBiobanc,
Barcelona, Spain). Three micrometers tissue sections
from formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded samples
were obtained, mounted onto charged slides and then,
deparaffinised in xylene and hydrated.
The following antibodies were used: MET (SP44)
mouse mAb (Ventana-Roche, Tucson, AZ, USA), p-MET
Y1234/35 (D26) XP rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA, USA), E-cadherin (NCH-38) mouse mAb (Dako,
Carpinteria, CA, USA), Snail1 (EC3) mouse mAb, and
vimentin (V9) mouse mAb (Dako).
Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization
for SPARC protocols have been described elsewhere
[23]. Stainings were evaluated by two pathologists
independently blinded to clinical information on a light
microscope (Olympus DX50, Olympus Corp., Tokyo,
Japan).
MET, p-MET, and E-cadherin were scored when any
percentage of tumor cells was stained in the membrane.
Snail1 was evaluated in the nucleus of tumor cells.
Vimentin and SPARC were quantified when detected in
the cytoplasm of tumor cells. A semiquantitative histoscore
(Hscore) was calculated, determined by estimation of the
percentage of tumor cells positively stained with low,
medium, or high staining intensity for each marker. The
final score was determined after applying a weighting
factor to each estimate. The formula used was Hscore =
(low %) + 2x (medium %) + 3x (high %), and the results
ranged from 0 to 300. The tumors in the present study
were classified as p-MET, Snail1, SPARC and vimentin
negative when the H-score was 0, vs. positive for any
positive H-score. For E-Cadherin and total Met, the
median was used as the cut-off for positivity.

HGF ELISA
The Quantikine Human HGF Immunoassay (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used to measure HGF
levels in human serum [22].
This assay employs the quantitative sandwich
immunoassay technique. A monoclonal antibody
specific for HGF has been pre-coated onto a microplate.
Standards and samples were diluted with the assay

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out with the R 3.1
program together with the Statistical Assessment Service
from IMIM. To analyze associations between categorical
variables we used the Chi-square test or the Fisher’s exact
test as appropriate. Continuous variables were compared
with Mann–Whitney U- test. Spearman correlation
coefficient was used to assess correlations between HGF
from plasma versus serum. Wilcoxon tests were done
to compare sHGF levels from patients at different time
points. Overall survival was analyzed by Kaplan–Meier
method. Curves were compared by the log-rank test. Cox
proportional hazards model was used for multivariate
analysis. All tests were conducted at the two-sided
0.05 level of significance. This work was performed in
accordance with REMARK guidelines [24].
