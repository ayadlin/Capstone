Abstract
Drug resistance is a major cause of treatment failure in cancer. Here, we have evaluated the role of STAT3 in
environment-mediated drug resistance (EMDR) in human neuroblastoma. We determined that STAT3 was not
constitutively active in most neuroblastoma cell lines but was rapidly activated upon treatment with interleukin
(IL)-6 alone and in combination with the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with IL6 protected them from drug-induced apoptosis in a STAT3-dependent manner because the protective effect of IL6 was abrogated in the presence of a STAT3 inhibitor and upon STAT3 knockdown. STAT3 was necessary for the
upregulation of several survival factors such as survivin (BIRC5) and Bcl-xL (BCL2L1) when cells were exposed to
IL-6. Importantly, IL-6–mediated STAT3 activation was enhanced by sIL-6R produced by human monocytes,
pointing to an important function of monocytes in promoting IL-6–mediated EMDR. Our data also point to the
presence of reciprocal activation of STAT3 between tumor cells and bone marrow stromal cells including not only
monocytes but also regulatory T cells (Treg) and nonmyeloid stromal cells. Thus, the data identify an IL-6/sIL-6R/
STAT3 interactive pathway between neuroblastoma cells and their microenvironment that contributes to drug
resistance. Cancer Res; 73(13); 3852–64. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Over the last 10 years, it has become increasingly appreciated that tumor cells that lack the intrinsic ability to initiate
an angiogenic response, to resist the injury of therapies or to
metastasize, can acquire such properties through the inﬂuence
of the microenvironment (1). The acquisition of these properties occurs through complex interactions between tumor
cells and a variety of stromal cells such as carcinoma-associated ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, myoﬁbroblasts,
mesenchymal cells, and innate and adaptive immune cells (2–
5). The identiﬁcation of pathways involved in these interactions has therefore been the subject of intensive investigation
over the recent years with the anticipation that these pathways
will be novel targets for anticancer therapy (6). Among the
characteristics that tumor cells acquire through their interaction with the microenvironment is drug resistance, a major
cause of failure to eradicate cancer. The acquisition of drug

resistance through interactions between tumor cells and their
environment, known as "environment-mediated drug resistance" (EMDR; ref. 7), is an important contributor to the
emergence of minimal residual disease in cancer. EMDR occurs
through complex adhesion-dependent and -independent interactions between tumor cells and the extracellular matrix
(ECM) and stromal cells (8, 9). The bone marrow microenvironment plays a particularly important role in EMDR as it is an
abundant source of ECM proteins, cytokines, and growth
factors produced by mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem
cells and their progeny that promote homing and survival (10).
The bone marrow is also the most frequent site of metastasis
in neuroblastoma, a tumor derived from the neural crest that
is the second most common solid malignancy affecting children (11, 12). It is a source of multiple chemokines, cytokines,
and growth factors including interleukin (IL)-6. We have
previously shown that in the case of neuroblastoma, IL-6 is
not produced by tumor cells but by bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC) and tumor-associated
macrophages (TAM; refs. 13–15). The paracrine production
of IL-6 by BMMSC plays a dual role in neuroblastoma bone
marrow and bone metastasis. It activates osteoclasts, promoting the formation of osteolytic lesions and stimulates the
growth and survival of neuroblastoma cells (16). Among the
signaling pathways activated by IL-6, is the signal transducer
and activator of transcription (STAT3) that plays a central
role in the communication between tumor cells and immune
cells (17). STAT3 was initially discovered as a transcription
factor induced by IFN-g (18). It is considered an oncogene as it
is required for the oncogenic transformation activity of v-Src
(19). It has multiple protumorigenic functions including the

STAT3 in IL-6–Mediated Drug Resistance

promotion of tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion,
metastasis, and angiogenesis (20–22). In addition, STAT3 is
a major contributor to inﬂammation (23) and has been shown
to promote the acquisition of chemo- and radioresistance (24,
25). In most cancers STAT3 is constitutively active, but its
activation can also occur through the inﬂuences of the microenvironment and in particular IL-6 (26). IL-6 binds to an
heterodimeric receptor made of 2 subunits, the gp80 a subunit
(IL-6R) that is the ligand-binding unit and the gp130 b subunit
that is the signal-transducing unit, which via phosphorylation
of Janus-activated kinases (JAK), activates STAT3 (27). The
gp80 unit is also present in a soluble form [soluble IL-6
receptor (sIL-6R)] that has an agonistic effect through its
trans signaling function (28). Here, we have explored the role
of STAT3 activation by IL-6 and sIL-6R in EMDR in human
neuroblastoma.

60 mmol/L. Recombinant human IL-6 and sIL-6R were purchased from R&D Systems. A humanized mouse monoclonal

Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses were conducted as previously
described (16). Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with 1 tablet of complete
mini-EDTA protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics) or
halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo
Scientiﬁc). The detection of immune complexes and their
quantiﬁcation was conducted using either the Odyssey Infrared Imaging Systems (LI-COR Biosciences) or chemiluminescence with an HRP antibody detection kit (Denville) and the
NIH ImageJ software for analysis.

Flow cytometry
For JC-1 stain, cultured cells were detached in cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) and stained for 30 minutes in the
presence of JC-1 dye (10 mg/mL; MitoProbe JC-1 Assay Kit;
Invitrogen) before being analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. For
Annexin V stain, cultured cells were resuspended in 1
Annexin V–binding buffer. Annexin V and propidium iodide

unmasking was conducted by proteinase K treatment (20 mg/
mL for 10 minutes at 25 C). The slides were incubated overnight at 4 C in the presence of the following primary antibodies: a rabbit anti-human pY705 STAT3, survivin, or Bcl-xL, a
mouse anti-CD68 or a rabbit antityrosine hydroxylase mAb
(dilutions 1:100). After washing 3 with 0.1% Triton-X 100 in
PBS, the slides were incubated in the presence of one of the
following secondary antibodies: an Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-mouse IgG antibody (dilution
1:50) for 1 hour at room temperature. For immunoﬂuorescence, slides were mounted in 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) containing Vectashield medium. For dual immunohistochemistry, the Bond Polymer Reﬁne Detection (Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd.) was used. Slides were heated at pH 6
for 20 minutes before being processed. The biotin-free polymeric HRP linker (DS 9800) was used for the detection of
pSTAT3 and the biotin-free polymeric alkaline phosphatase
linker (DS 9390) was used for the detection of Protein Gene
Product (PGP) 9.5 and CD45. As primary antibodies, we used a
mouse anti-human PGP 9.5 from Leica (PA0286) undiluted, a
mouse anti-CD45 mAb from Abcam (ab8216) at a 1:25 dilution,
and a rabbit anti-pSTAT3 (Tyr705) polyclonal antibody from
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (9131) at a 1:25 dilution. Primary and secondary antibodies were incubated for 30 minutes.
Immunocytoﬂuorescence
Cells were cultured in Lab-Tek II 8 chamber slides for 48
hours (2  104 and 10  104 cells/well). Cells were then washed,
treated with IL-6 and sIl-6R for 30 minutes, and then ﬁxed with
4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes and permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton-X100 in 15% FBS in PBS for 5 minutes, before
being incubated in the presence of an anti-human pSTAT3 or
STAT3 antibody overnight at 4 C.
Statistical analysis
For the analyses of cell viability, the luciferase or ﬂuorescence activity readings were assumed to have a lognormal
distribution and were transformed to the log10 scale before
analyses were conducted. ANOVA was used to examine the
differences in mean cell viability among groups and the Student (two-tailed) test was used to compare 2 groups in the
apoptotic assays. All P values reported were two-sided. A P
value of less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. Data were
analyzed with software STATA version 11.2 (StataCorp LP).

Results
IL-6 and sIL-6R activate STAT3 in neuroblastoma cells
We had previously reported that with a few exceptions most
human neuroblastoma cells do not produce signiﬁcant
amounts of IL-6 and do not secrete sIL-6R, but express the
2 IL-6R subunits (16). To determine the status of STAT3
activation in neuroblastoma, we initially examined 8 human
tumor cell lines for the expression of STAT3 and phospho Y705
STAT3 (pSTAT3) by Western blot analysis under baseline
conditions and upon treatment with IL-6, sIL-6R, and their
combination. This analysis revealed a low amount of pSTAT3
in most untreated cells (except in SK-N-SH and CHLA-90 cells),
indicating a general absence of constitutive activation of

3854

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

STAT3 in neuroblastoma (Fig. 1A). However, when cells were
treated with IL-6 alone and in particular in combination with
sIL-6R, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in pSTAT3 after 30
minutes in all cell lines. Activation of STAT3 in CHLA-255 and
CHLA-90 cells was conﬁrmed by immunocytoﬂuorescence
(Fig. 1B). This analysis revealed the presence of cytoplasmic
STAT3 in both cell lines. In CHLA-255 cells, pSTAT3 was not
detected in the absence of IL-6 but became detectable in the
nucleus upon treatment with IL-6 alone or in combination with
sIL-6R. In contrast, nuclear pSTAT3 was detected in CHLA-90
cells with or without treatment with IL-6 and sIL-6R. To
conﬁrm the role of IL-6 in STAT3 activation, we showed that
incubation of CHLA-255 cells with a mAb against human IL-6R
(tocilizumab) before treatment with IL-6 and IL-6 plus sIL-6R
suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1A)
and the binding of STAT3 to DNA as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
We also showed that CHLA-255 cells transiently transfected
with a STAT3 responsive promoter construct driving the ﬁreﬂy
luciferase reporter gene (STAT3Fluc) and a renilla luciferase
vector had a 4-fold increase in ﬁreﬂy/Renilla luciferase activity
when treated with IL-6 plus sIL-6R, and that this increase in
activity was suppressed in the presence of tocilizumab (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Thus, altogether the data showed that IL6 is an effective and speciﬁc activator of STAT3 in human
neuroblastoma, in particular in the presence of sIL-6R.
IL-6 and sIL-6R protect neuroblastoma cells from druginduced apoptosis
To show the role of IL-6 in chemoresistance, we selected 2
drug-sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines (CHLA-255 and SK-NSH) and tested the effect of IL-6 and sIL-6R on their survival in
the presence of etoposide and melphalan (32, 33). This analysis
revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the survival fraction in
both cell lines upon exposure to etoposide or melphalan for 24
hours (Fig. 2A–D). However, when cells were pretreated with
IL-6 (alone and with sIL-6R) and then exposed to the drug, we
observed a signiﬁcant increase in the survival fraction when
compared with the drug alone. As anticipated, the addition of
sIL-6R alone in the absence of IL-6 failed to protect neuroblastoma cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3A). We next examined the effect of IL-6 and sIL-6R
pretreatment on mitochondrial membrane depolarization and
caspase-3 and -9 activation in cells treated with etoposide or
melphalan (Fig. 3). The data showed that pretreatment of
CHLA-255 cells with IL-6 alone or with sIL-6R resulted in less
mitochondrial membrane depolarization (Fig. 3A and B). IL-6
also inhibited the cytoplasmic release of cytochrome C upon
treatment with etoposide (Fig. 3C). Consistently, pretreatment
of CHLA-255 cells with IL-6 inhibited the cleavage of caspase-3
and -9 in the presence of increased concentrations of etoposide
or melphalan (Fig. 3D and E). Altogether, the data thus
indicated that IL-6 had a protective effect on drug-induced
intrinsic apoptosis.
STAT3 is necessary for IL-6–mediated drug resistance
We next asked the question whether STAT3 activation was
necessary for the protective effect of IL-6 on drug-induced

Lysates were obtained 30 minutes after treatment. The data are representative of 2 to 3 separate experiments showing similar results. B, the presence of

apoptosis. We ﬁrst used stattic, a small-molecule inhibitor of
STAT3 activation (29) and showed that treatment of CHLA-255
cells with stattic (0.5 to 20 mmol/L) prevented STAT3 activation
by IL-6 plus sIL-6R (Fig. 4A). We then examined the effect of
stattic (at 2.5 mmol/L, to maintain 80% cell viability) on
apoptosis induced by etoposide in CHLA-255 cells pretreated
with IL-6 and sIL-6R. The data indicated that stattic restored
etoposide-induced apoptosis in the presence of IL-6 and IL-6
plus sIL-6R to levels observed in the absence of IL-6 and stattic
(Fig. 4B).

sensitivity to etoposide in the presence of IL-6 and sIL-6R.

STAT3 knockdown and a complete suppression of STAT3
activation upon treatment with IL-6 alone or with sIL-6R
when compared with a scramble siRNA sequence (Fig. 4C).
STAT3 knockdown in CHLA-255 cells restored their sensitivity to etoposide in the presence of IL-6 and sIL-6R to levels
close to the level of apoptosis observed in the absence of IL-6
(Fig. 4D). The knockdown of STAT3 in SK-N-SH cells had a
similar effect on the sensitivity of these cells to etoposide in

the presence of IL-6 and sIL-6R (Supplementary Fig. S2A and
S2B). The data thus showed that the protective effect of IL-6
on drug-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma was STAT3
activation-dependent.
Upregulation of survival proteins by IL-6 is STAT3
dependent
We investigated the effect of IL-6 on the expression of
survival proteins in CHLA-255 cells. The data indicated an
increase in the expression of survivin, Mcl-1, XIAP-1, and Bcl-xL
(Fig. 5A). An upregulation of survivin and Bcl-xL (to a lesser
extent) was also observed in SK-N-SH cells treated with IL-6
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). We then showed that the upregulation of some of these survival proteins was STAT3 dependent
by showing that stattic inhibited the nuclear expression of
survivin in CHLA-255 cells treated with IL-6 and IL-6 þ sIL-6R
(Fig. 5B) and by documenting a marked decrease in survivin
expression and an absence of Bcl-xL expression upon STAT3
knockdown in cells treated with IL-6 and IL-6 plus sIL-6R (Fig.
5C). The data suggested that STAT3-dependent upregulation

3856

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

of survival factors such as survivin and Bcl-xL was a mechanism by which IL-6 protected neuroblastoma cells from
apoptosis.
BMMSC and monocytes cooperate to sensitize
neuroblastoma cells to IL-6–mediated STAT3 activation
Our in vitro data consistently showed that IL-6 was more
active on neuroblastoma cells in the presence of sIL-6R. This
suggested that sIL-6R sensitized neuroblastoma cells to
STAT3 activation by IL-6. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the addition of sIL-6R at a concentration of 25
ng/mL, which is within the range of the levels detected in the
blood of patients with neuroblastoma (10–90 ng/mL; refs. 34,
35), would result in STAT3 activation in the presence of
concentrations of IL-6 in the (0.1 to 10) ng/mL range. These
experiments showed that when IL-6 was used alone, a
concentration of 10 ng/mL was necessary to activate STAT3,
whereas when used in combination with sIL-6R (25 ng/mL),
a concentration of 0.1 ng/mL of IL-6 was sufﬁcient for STAT3
activation (Fig. 6A). We then tested whether activation of

Figure 3. IL-6 and sIL-6R protect neuroblastoma cells from drug-induced apoptosis. A and B, CHLA-255 cells were treated as in Fig. 2. After 24 hours,
mitochondrial membrane depolarization (MyP) was examined by JC-1 staining by ﬂow cytometry. The data represent the mean (SE) percentage change in
depolarization from control cells (untreated with cytotoxic drugs). C, CHLA-255 cells were treated as indicated earlier. After 24 hours, cytosolic and
mitochondrial extracts were examined for the presence of cytochrome C by Western blot analysis. The data are representative of 2 separate
experiments showing similar results. Cox-IV and b-actin were used as loading control for mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, respectively. D and E,
CHLA-255 cells were treated with IL-6 and etoposide or melphalan. After 24 hours of drug exposure, cell lysates were examined for the expression of full length

Figure 4. STAT3 is necessary for IL-6–mediated drug resistance. A, CHLA-255 cells were treated with IL-6 (10 ng/mL) and sIL-6R (25 ng/mL) for 30 minutes in
the presence of stattic at indicated concentrations. Cell lysates were examined for pSTAT3 and STAT3 expression by Western blot analysis. B, CHLA-255 cells
were treated with stattic (2.5 mmol/L) and IL-6 and sIL-6R for 24 hours before being exposed to etoposide (0.25 mg/mL). After 24 hours, cells were
examined for Annexin V expression by ﬂow cytometry. The data represent the mean percentage (SD) of Annexin V–positive cells from 4 samples obtained
in 3 independent experiments. C, CHLA-255 cells were transfected with STAT3 siRNA or with a scramble sequence. After 72 hours, cells were treated
with IL-6 and sIL-6R for 30 minutes and cell lysates were examined for pSTAT3 and STAT3 expression by Western blot analysis. The data are representative of
3 separate experiments showing similar results. D, siRNA-transfected CHLA-255 cells were treated with IL-6 and sIL-6R for 24 hours before being
exposed to etoposide (0.25 mg/mL) and examined for the presence of Annexin V at the cell surface. The data represent the mean percentage (SD) of Annexin
V–positive cells compared with control (cells treated with etoposide alone) from 4 samples obtained from 3 independent experiments.

STAT3 in the presence of 10 ng/mL of IL-6 could be
potentiated by lower concentrations of sIL-6R. The data
(Fig. 6B) showed an increase in pSTAT3 activation in the
presence of 10 ng/mL of sIL-6R and above but not at lower
concentrations (0.1 and 1.0 ng/mL). These sIL-6R concentrations are found in the blood of patients with cancer (35).
Because neuroblastoma cells do not produce sIL-6R and are
thus dependent of a paracrine source (16), we examined
whether it was produced by normal cells in the tumor
microenvironment. We ﬁrst tested BMMSC that we had
previously shown to be a source of IL-6 (13). The data
showed an anticipated increase in the production of IL-6
(to 1,600 pg/mL) when BMMSC were cocultured with CHLA255 cells and low amount of sIL-6R (mean 32.5  14.8 pg/mL;
Fig. 6C, top). We then tested human monocytes that we had
also shown to be a source of IL-6 (14). This experiment
revealed that monocytes produced IL-6 and sIL-6R in culture
and that their production was signiﬁcantly increased in the
presence of CHLA-255 cells. The amount of sIL-6R produced
(mean 149.5  8.6 pg/mL) in the presence of CHLA-255 was

3858

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

5-fold higher than BMMSC in similar conditions (Fig. 6C,
bottom). Although this concentration is lower than the
concentration required to enhance STAT3 activation in vitro
(Fig. 6B), we showed that when human monocytes were
cocultured with CHLA-255 cells, STAT3 became activated in
the tumor cells even in the presence of low amounts of IL-6
(20 pg/mL) and that activation was in part IL-6R–dependent
as it was partially inhibited in the presence of tocilizumab
(Fig. 6D). The data thus point to the important contributory
function of monocytes to STAT3 activation that is in part
mediated by IL-6 and sIL-6R but could involve other activators. We also asked whether STAT3 would be activated in
monocytes when cultured in the presence of neuroblastoma
cells. In this experiment, CHLA-255 cells and human monocytes were cultured alone or in contact for 24 hours and the
mixture of cells was analyzed for the presence of nuclear
pSTAT3 and cell surface CD14 (monocytes) and CD56 (neuroblastoma). The data (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig. S3B)
indicated an absence of pSTAT3 in cells cultured alone but a
signiﬁcant increase in pSTAT3 in both tumor cells and

STAT3 is activated in the bone marrow
microenvironment in patients with metastatic
neuroblastoma
To provide evidence for a role of STAT3 in patients with
metastatic neuroblastoma, we examined STAT3 activation in a
series of 10 bone marrow biopsies obtained from children with
neuroblastoma. Five specimens were classiﬁed as positive for
tumor involvement in the marrow (as assessed by the presence
of tyrosine hydroxylase–positive cells by immunohistochemistry; ref 36) and 5 were classiﬁed as negative for tumor cells. An
analysis of the presence of nuclear pSTAT3-positive cells in
these samples revealed a higher percentage (22.3%  6.06%) of
nuclear pSTAT3 in samples with tumor cells and a lower
percentage (7.9%  1.8%; P ¼ 0.002) in samples negative for
tumor cells (Fig. 7A). There was also a higher number of
survivin-positive cells in samples inﬁltrated with tumor cells
than in samples without tumor cells (122  69 vs. 10  14,
respectively) and a higher level of Bcl-xL expression (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Because our in vitro coculture experiments
on tumor cells and monocytes indicated a reciprocal activation
of pSTAT3 (Fig. 6D and E), we then asked the question whether

STAT3 was activated in tumor cells and stromal cells in the
bone marrow of patients with neuroblastoma. An analysis of
pSTAT3 and CD45 by double immunohistochemistry on a bone
marrow biopsy sample containing more than 90% tumor cells
(Fig. 7B) indicated that 93% of PGP9.5þ tumor cells were also
pSTAT3-positive and that 42% of CD45þ myeloid cells were
also positive for pSTAT3. By double immunoﬂuorescence with
an anti-CD68 antibody, we then showed the presence of
nuclear pSTAT3 in CD68þ monocytes/macrophages. The data
are consistent with our in vitro coculture experiment (Fig. 6E)
and indicate that STAT3 in the bone marrow microenvironment is not only activated in tumor cells but also in myeloid
cells including monocytes/macrophages (Fig. 7C). To better
deﬁne subpopulations of these pSTAT3-positive myeloid
cells, we examined by ﬂow cytometry an additional 8 fresh
bone marrow samples from patients with neuroblastoma
for the presence of nuclear pSTAT3 (Supplementary Fig.
S4A). Using a combination of 6 surface markers (CD3, CD4,
CD14, CD25, CD45, and GD2) and 1 nuclear marker (FoxP3),
we identiﬁed 6 populations of cells with CD45/GD2
(nonmyeloid), CD45þ/CD14 (myeloid nonmonocytic), and
CD45þ/CD14þ (monocytic) being the most (>10% of total
mononuclear cells) abundant (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
An analysis of pSTAT3 in these different populations indicated a greater than 10% positive cells in 4 subpopulations,

Discussion
Overexpression of IL-6 by BMMSC has a dual protumorigenic function on neuroblastoma cells by promoting osteoclast activation (13) and tumor cell proliferation and
survival (16). Here, we show the presence of an IL-6/sIL6R/STAT3 paracrine pathway of interaction between tumor
cells and the microenvironment that provides tumor cells
with the ability to counteract the apoptotic effect of cytotoxic agents. Constitutive activation of STAT3 by oncogenes

www.aacrjournals.org

such as Src, Fes, Sis, PyMT, Ros, or Eyk has been reported
(37) but not by MYC-N, which is often ampliﬁed in neuroblastoma (38). Among the 8 cell lines examined, one, SK-NBE (2), exhibited ampliﬁcation of the MYC-N oncogene and
in this cell line—as in most other cell lines without MYC-N
ampliﬁcation—STAT3 was not constitutively active. Our
data indicate that in contrast to many other types of cancer,
STAT3 activation is rarely constitutive in neuroblastoma
but seems dependent on the tumor microenvironment.
Although our data speciﬁcally point to a role for IL-6 as
activator of STAT3, they do not rule out the possibility that
other cytokines and growth factors could also contribute.

Our data identify a central function for the IL-6/sIL-6R/
STAT3 pathway in conferring drug resistance to neuroblastoma cells. This effect involves the upregulation of several
antiapoptotic proteins in particular survivin, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1,
and XIAP that are known transcriptional targets of STAT3
(25, 39, 40). The observation that survivin is downstream of
STAT3 signaling is relevant as high levels of survivin in neuroblastoma have also been associated with poorer clinical
outcome (41). It has been previously reported that IL-6–mediated STAT3 activation plays a role in EMDR in myeloma (42),
however, the mechanisms involved seem different between the
2 types of cancer. In myeloma, activation of STAT3 by IL-6 is
primarily mediated by b1 integrin-dependent adhesion of
myeloma cells to bone marrow stromal cells (8). In contrast,
in neuroblastoma, the expression of IL-6 in the bone marrow
stroma is primarily regulated by soluble factors produced by
tumor cells including prostaglandin E2 (16) and galectin-3–
binding protein (43) among others.
Our data provide a new insight into the contributory role of
monocytes to STAT3 activation by showing that monocytes
produce sIL-6R and that sIL-6R enhances the sensitivity of
neuroblastoma cells to IL-6–mediated STAT3 activation. The
importance of sIL-6R in IL-6/gp130 signaling in autoimmunity,
inﬂammation and cancer has been recently emphasized (44).
Elevated levels of sIL-6R have been reported in the blood of
patients with cancer including neuroblastoma and myeloma,
and are typically a marker of unfavorable clinical outcome (34,
35, 45). These blood levels (ng/mL) are higher by 100-fold than
the in vitro concentration of sIL-6R observed in cocultures of
neuroblastoma cells and human monocytes. Although the
reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear, our data show
a strong activation of STAT3 in cocultures of neuroblastoma
cells and monocytes that is in part suppressed by a blocking
antibody against IL-6R supporting a potentiating effect also at
lower concentrations in coculture when IL-6 and sIL-6R are
constantly produced and secreted. The data nevertheless do
not rule out the possibility of other interactive pathways of
activation. For example, a reciprocal activation of STAT3
between tumor cells and bone marrow–derived cells has
recently been described and shown to be mediated by the
sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), a member of the
G protein–coupled receptor family of the lysophospholipids
that sustains STAT3 activation by IL-6 (46). Whether S1PR1
plays such a role in sustaining STAT3 activation in neuroblastoma is presently investigated by our laboratories. Our data
point to the important role that monocytes could play in EMDR
in cancer, a new function recently showed in a mouse model of
mammary carcinoma by Denardo and colleagues, who showed
that suppression of macrophage inﬁltration in tumors
increases response to chemotherapy (47). A similar protective
role of monocytes in cis-platinum–induced apoptosis in colon
and lung cancer-initiating cells has also been recently reported
(48).
Interestingly, our analysis of pSTAT3 expression in bone
marrow samples of patients with neuroblastoma revealed the
presence of pSTAT3 not only in tumor cells and in CD45þ
myeloid cells including CD68þ monocytes/macrophages, but
also in a CD25þ, FoxP3þ Treg cells. Activation of pSTAT3 in

3862

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

Treg cells has been shown to be mediated by IL-23 produced by
TAM under STAT3 activation, which leads to the expression of
FoxP3 and the secretion of the immunosuppressive cytokines
IL-10 by Treg (49). Finally, we also observed a subpopulation of
CD45/GD2 bone marrow cells that expressed pSTAT3.
Although these cells were not fully characterized at this point,
they could represent in part mesenchymal cells that we have
shown to play a critical intermediary role in bone invasion in
neuroblastoma (13).
Ultimately, our data raise the question whether inhibition of
IL-6–mediated STAT3 activation in neuroblastoma could play
a role in therapy by preventing EMDR. Several humanized
mAbs against soluble and membrane bound IL-6R (tocilizumab, REGN88) or against IL-6 (siltuximab and sirukumab) are
currently in clinical trials for Castleman's disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, and several types of cancer (44). Other potentially
active agents include small-molecule inhibitors of JAK, some of
them being currently tested in clinical trials (50, 51). Our data
suggest that in neuroblastoma, these inhibitors may be most
effective in combination with cytotoxic agents to prevent
EMDR.
In summary, we provide here a new mechanistic insight on
the contributory role of the bone marrow microenvironment in
promoting drug resistance in neuroblastoma, as we show that
by being a source of IL-6 and sIL-6R, the bone marrow
microenvironment provides tumor cells with the ability to
resist the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy through STAT3
activation.
