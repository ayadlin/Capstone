Abstract
Topoisomerase IIA (topo IIA) is exported from the nucleus of
human myeloma cells by a CRM1-dependent mechanism at
cellular densities similar to those found in patient bone
marrow. When topo IIA is trafficked to the cytoplasm, it is not
in contact with the DNA; thus, topo IIA inhibitors are unable to
induce DNA-cleavable complexes and cell death. Using a CRM1
inhibitor or a CRM1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), we
were able to block nuclear export of topo IIA as shown by
immunofluorescence microscopy. Human myeloma cell lines
and patient myeloma cells isolated from bone marrow were
treated with a CRM1 inhibitor or CRM1-specific siRNA and
exposed to doxorubicin or etoposide at high cell densities.
CRM1-treated cell lines or myeloma patient cells were 4-fold
more sensitive to topo II poisons as determined by an
activated caspase assay. Normal cells were not significantly
affected by CRM1-topo II inhibitor combination treatment.
Cell death was correlated with increased DNA double-strand
breaks as shown by the comet assay. Band depletion assays of
CRM1 inhibitor–exposed myeloma cells showed increased
topo IIA covalently bound to DNA. Topo IIA knockdown by a
topo IIA–specific siRNA abrogated the CRM1-topo II therapy
synergistic effect. These results suggest that blocking topo IIA
nuclear export sensitizes myeloma cells to topo II inhibitors.
This method of sensitizing myeloma cells suggests a new
therapeutic approach to multiple myeloma. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Drug resistance is a major obstacle in the treatment of multiple
myeloma, including resistance to topoisomerase II (topo II)
inhibitors. Topo II poisons that are used in the treatment of
multiple myeloma include doxorubicin and etoposide (VP-16).
Several mechanisms of resistance to topo IIa inhibitors have been
described (reviewed previously in refs. 1–5). Cell adhesion–
mediated drug resistance and stromal cell adherence are important
parameters in the local bone marrow environment in patients with
multiple myeloma and appear to be major determinants of drug
resistance (6, 7).
Our laboratory has shown previously that human multiple
myeloma cell density is a determinant of sensitivity to topo II
inhibitors (8–10). At increased cell densities, a considerable

fraction of nuclear topo IIa is exported to the cytoplasm (>90%),
resulting in reduced sensitivity to VP-16 and doxorubicin. This
appears to occur both in human myeloma cell lines and in CD138+
cells isolated from patients with multiple myeloma (9). We have
reported that the nuclear export of topo IIa may contribute to drug
resistance (9), and our data suggest that resistance is not due to
differences in drug uptake, cell cycle, or cellular topo IIa protein
levels (8–10). In a previous report, our group defined the nuclear
export signals for topo IIa at amino acids 1,017 to 1,028 and 1,054
to 1,066 (10). Export by both signals was blocked by treatment of
the cells with leptomycin B, indicating that a CRM1-dependent
pathway mediates export (10). In the present study, we show that
inhibition of CRM1-mediated export of topo IIa may render
myeloma cells both in vitro and ex vivo more sensitive to topo II–
targeted chemotherapy.
Use of CRM1 inhibition in cancer therapy has met with limited
success. The first CRM1 inhibitor, leptomycin B, was found to
efficiently inhibit nuclear export (11). However, leptomycin was
found to have acute relative toxicities both in a human phase I trial
(12) and in vitro (13). Leptomycin B in vitro studies found acute
toxicity at concentrations <5 nmol/L for 1 h (13). Therefore, in this
study, we used the CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C (14–18). Ratjadone
C has been found to inhibit nuclear export without producing
apoptosis or necrosis at concentrations up to 300 nmol/L for 48 h in
an in vitro assay (18). However, ratjadone C prevents nuclear export
of topo IIa; in this study, we show that ratjadone C also acutely
sensitizes myeloma cells to the topo II inhibitors doxorubicin and
VP-16. Additional low-toxicity CRM1 inhibitors are also being
investigated by other laboratories and may become available for
preclinical studies (13).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Human myeloma cell lines NCI-H929 (H929) and RPMI-8226
(8226) were newly obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
U266B1 (U266) human myeloma cell lines were provided by Dr. Lori
Hazlehurst (H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center). All cell lines were grown in RPMI
1640 containing 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin
(Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) at 37jC and 5% CO2.
H929 cell medium required the addition of 0.025% h-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma).
Cell density and drug treatment. The model used to assay densitydependent protein trafficking involved incubating cells at high- and lowdensity culture conditions. Our group has shown previously that cells grown
at different densities exhibit specific characteristics such as drug resistance
and nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of topo IIa (8–10). Human myeloma cell
lines (8226, H929, and U266) grown at 2  105 cells/mL were defined as low
density (log phase), and cells grown at 2  106 cells/mL were defined as
high density (plateau phase). Cell lines were placed at log- and plateaudensity conditions and incubated with and without the highly specific
CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C (refs. 14–18; Department of Chemical Biology,
HZI/Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research) or were transfected with

Figure 1. Intracellular trafficking of topo IIa in log- and
plateau-density myeloma cells. A, H929, U266, and
8226 human myeloma cells grown at plateau (Plat )
phase (high density) export topo IIa, whereas cells
grown at log (Log ) phase (low density) maintain topo
IIa in the nucleus. Cells were grown for 16 h at log or
plateau densities and treated with 2 Amol/L doxorubicin for
4 h (n = 2). Apoptosis was determined by caspase-3
staining with the use of flow cytometry (10,000 cells).
Cells that maintained nuclear topo IIa were more sensitive
to topo II–targeted chemotherapy. B, cells grown at
log- or plateau-phase conditions or cells treated with
ratjadone C (RDC; 100 cells per experiment) were stained
for topo IIa by fluorescence microscopy (n = 2).
Myeloma cells grown at log-phase conditions had the
majority (z90%) of the topo IIa in the nucleus, whereas
plateau-phase cells exported topo IIa into the
cytoplasm. The CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C (5 nmol/L)
was found to block export of topo IIa in cells grown in
plateau-phase conditions.

CRM1 200 nmol/L small interfering RNA (siRNA; Dharmacon). Ratjadones
are naturally occurring antibiotics isolated from myxobacteria (16).
Ratjadone C is a potent inhibitor of CRM1 and prevents nuclear export
by alkylating the active site Cys528 amino acid residue of CRM1 (17).
Ratjadone C has been shown to have anticancer properties and has reduced
toxicity in vitro compared to leptomycin B (14, 16, 18). To determine the
concentration of ratjadone C to use, we titrated ratjadone C to find the
lowest concentration that would inhibit nuclear export of topo IIa in
myeloma cell lines H929 and 8226. The concentration arrived at was f5
nmol/L; all ratjadone C experiments used this concentration. Cells were
treated with ratjadone C for 16 h followed by doxorubicin (2 Amol/L; Sigma)
for 4 h or VP-16 (10 Amol/L; Sigma) for 8 h and assayed for apoptosis by
either anti-caspase-3 or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling staining (BD Pharmingen).
CRM1 inhibitor sensitizes patient myeloma cells to topo II drugs.
Human bone marrow aspirates obtained from multiple myeloma patients
were collected using a protocol approved by the University of South Florida
Institutional Review Board. Patient samples were assayed for percentage of
plasma cells by toluidine blue staining and microscopy. Cells used for assay
consisted of between 75% and 90% plasma cells isolated by Ficoll gradient
centrifugation. Cells (4  106/mL) were treated with ratjadone C (5 nmol/L)
for 16 h followed by doxorubicin (2 Amol/L) for 4 h and assayed for
apoptosis by anti-caspase-3 (BD Pharmingen).
siRNA knockdown and Western blot. All electroporation transfections
were done in a freshly made transfection buffer containing 120 mmol/L
potassium chloride (Sigma), 0.15 mmol/L calcium chloride, 10 mmol/L
potassium phosphate (pH 7.6), 25 mmol/L HEPES, 2 mmol/L EGTA (pH
7.6), 5 mmol/L magnesium chloride, 2 mmol/L ATP (pH 7.6), 5 mmol/L
glutathione, 1.25% DMSO, and 50 mmol/L trehalose (Sigma). Each
transfection used 3  106 myeloma cells. Cells were washed two times in
PBS and placed in a 200 AL volume of transfection buffer. CRM1-specific

siRNA (Dharmacon), scramble control siRNA (Dharmacon), or topo IIa–
specific siRNA (Ambion) was added (200 nmol/L); the sample was then
placed in a 2 mm electroporation cuvette and transfected at 140 V and 975
AF in a Bio-Rad GenePulser Xcell electroporation unit (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were incubated in the cuvette for 15 min at 37jC in a 5% CO2
incubator and transferred to a sterile T25 tissue culture flask, and 10 mL
fresh medium was added. After 48 h, the transfected cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 500  g for 5 min, washed with cold PBS, and lysed by
sonication (40% duty cycle, 7 bursts) in SDS buffer [2% SDS, 10% glycerol,
60 mmol/L Tris (pH 6.8)]. Protein from 2  105 cells per lane was separated
on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham) overnight (30 V at 4jC) with the use of a Bio-Rad
Mini-Transblot apparatus. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at ambient
temperature in a blocking buffer containing 0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl,
and 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk. CRM1 was identified by
incubation in a 1:1,000 dilution of H-300 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer overnight at 4jC. Membranes were washed three
times for 10 min in TBST and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit
polyclonal IgG antibody linked to a horseradish peroxidase antibody
(Sigma) in blocking buffer at a 1:2,000 dilution. Antibody binding was
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) on autoradiography film (Kodak). Transfected cells were treated with doxorubicin
(2 Amol/L) for 4 h and assayed for apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC staining
(BD Pharmingen).
Immunofluorescent microscopy. Multiple myeloma cells (1  105)
were plated on double cytoslides (Shandon) by cyto-centrifugation at
500 rpm for 3 min and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific)
on ice for 30 min. Permeabilization of cells was done with 0.5% Triton X-100
(Sigma) in PBS at room temperature for 60 min. Cells were stained with a
polyclonal antibody against topo IIa, which was produced in our laboratory
(PAB454; ref. 19). The topo IIa antibody was diluted 1:100 in a buffer

containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.1% Igepal CA-630
(Sigma) in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three
washes with PBS, slides were incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit Alexa
Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) in addition to a cytoskeletal protein stain, phalloidinAlexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Invitrogen). Each was diluted 1:1,000 in 1%
bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Igepal CA-630 in PBS and incubated for
40 min at room temperature. Slides were washed four times in PBS and
once in distilled water, and the nuclei were stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence was observed with the Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging)
with an Axiocam MRm camera (Carl Zeiss Microimaging). Two experiments
were done with 50 cells assayed per experiment. Cells were chosen
randomly and scored as nuclear or cytoplasmic when z90% of the
fluorescence was in the respective cellular compartment.
Band depletion assay. Band depletion assays were done as described by
Xiao and colleagues (20). Briefly, 5  105 cells were lysed in 50 AL alkaline
lysis solution for 30 min on ice (200 mmol/L NaOH, 2 mmol/L EDTA), and
the lysate was neutralized by the addition of 4 AL of both 1 mol/L HCl and
1.2 mol/L Tris (pH 8.0). The lysate was then mixed with 30 AL of 3 SDS
sample buffer [150 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6 mmol/L EDTA, 45% sucrose,
9% SDS, and 10% h-mercaptoethanol] and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels.
Comet assay. Log-density H929 myeloma cells were plated at a
concentration of 2  105/mL, and plateau-density cells were plated at
2  106/mL. All cells were grown in 24-well plates (Falcon) with 1 mL
sample/well. Drug treatment groups were vehicle only (1 AL/mL DMSO),
10 Amol/L VP-16, 5 nmol/L ratjadone C, or a combination of 10 Amol/L
VP-16 and 5 nmol/L ratjadone C. Cells that were treated with ratjadone C
were first plated at log or plateau density and incubated for 16 h with
ratjadone C or vehicle, after which VP-16 was added for 1 h. After 1 h of
VP-16 exposure, the comet assay was done as described by Kent and
colleagues (21) and modified by Chen and colleagues (22). To ensure
random sampling, 50 images were captured per slide on a Leica fluorescent
microscope and quantified with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The average comet moment value obtained from vehicle control
samples was subtracted from the average comet moment of each drug
treatment sample. The data shown are mean F SD of two separate
experiments.
Additional drug combinations in H929 human myeloma cell lines.
H929 human myeloma cell lines were placed at high density (4  106)
with and without 5 nmol/L ratjadone C and incubated for 16 h. Cells were
then incubated for 4 h with one of the following: 2 Amol/L doxorubicin,
10 Amol/L VP-16, 10 Amol/L melphalan, or 10 Amol/L Velcade. Cells were
assayed for apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling staining.

Results
Log- and plateau-density myeloma cells. The myeloma cell
lines 8226, H929, and U266 were grown at log-density (2  105
cells/mL) and plateau-density (2  106 cells/mL) growth conditions for 16 h. Cells were then treated with the topo II inhibitor
doxorubicin (2 Amol/L) for 4 h and assayed for apoptosis by
activated caspase-3 expression. We found that cells grown at
plateau densities and treated with 2 Amol/L doxorubicin had
extremely low levels of apoptosis compared with results shown for
log-phase cells (Fig. 1A). These data confirmed previous results that
showed that cells grown at different densities exhibit specific
characteristics, such as drug resistance and nuclear-cytoplasmic
trafficking of topo IIa (8–10). The topo IIa isozyme, topo IIh, is not
exported from the nucleus in human myeloma cells (8).
Intracellular trafficking of topo IIA. Cells grown at log and
plateau densities and ratjadone C–treated cells (100 cells per
experiment) were scored as ‘‘nuclear’’ or ‘‘cytoplasmic’’ if z90% of
topo IIa was in that compartment as determined by fluorescence
microscopy (Fig. 1B). For myeloma cells grown at log-phase
concentrations, 73% to 87% of cells had z90% of the topo IIa in the
nucleus; for cells grown at plateau-phase concentrations, 85% to
93% of cells had z90% of the topo IIa in the cytoplasm. CRM1
inhibition by ratjadone C was found to block export of topo IIa in
cells grown in plateau-phase conditions (Fig. 1B).
Topo IIA trafficking and CRM1 inhibition. H929 human
myeloma cells were grown at log and plateau densities and
stained for cytoskeletal protein (phalloidin; green), topo IIa
(red), and DNA (DAPI; blue). Results indicate that topo IIa
was present in the nucleus of log-density cells and was exported
from the nucleus in plateau-density cells (Fig. 2). Nuclear export
was blocked in plateau cells by the CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone
C and by transfection with a CRM1-specific siRNA. Under
the conditions of this experiment, CRM1 siRNA knockdown was
69%. For ratjadone C–treated plateau-density cells (Fig. 1B), f70%
of the cells had z90% topo IIa in the nucleus for each myeloma
cell line.
CRM1 inhibitor and topo IIA inhibitor synergy. The myeloma
cell lines 8226, H929, and U266 were grown for 16 h at plateau
densities in the presence of ratjadone C (5 nmol/L). The cells were

topo IIa (TOP2A ; red ), and DNA
(DAPI; blue ). Results indicate that topo IIa
is present in the nucleus of log-density cells
and is exported from the nucleus in
plateau-density cells. However, nuclear
export is blocked in plateau cells by the
CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C (RDC ) and by
transfection with CRM1-specific siRNA.
Under the conditions of this experiment,
CRM1 siRNA knockdown was 69%.

anticancer properties and has reduced toxicity in vitro compared to
leptomycin B when used at low concentrations (14, 16, 18).
CRM1 inhibitor sensitizes patient myeloma cells to topo II
drugs. Human bone marrow aspirates were obtained from
multiple myeloma patients and purified by Ficoll-Paque gradient.
Bone marrow samples with >75% plasma cells, as determined by
toluidine blue staining and microscopy, were used for each assay
(n = 7). Cells were placed at plateau concentration (4  106/mL),
treated with ratjadone C (5 nmol/L) for 16 h followed by
doxorubicin (2 Amol/L) for 4 h, and assayed for cleaved caspase3 to determine apoptosis. Cells treated with ratjadone C were
significantly (P = 0.0003) more sensitive to doxorubicin (3-fold)
than doxorubicin alone (Fig. 3B). Normal cells, including flow 2,000
cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 5), were not
sensitized by the CRM1 inhibitor (P = 0.22). Figure 3B shows
peripheral blood mononuclear cells only.
CRM1 inhibitor and topo IIA poisons. The human myeloma
cell lines 8226, H929, and U266 were incubated at high density
(2  106 cells/mL) for 16 h in the presence of the CRM1 inhibitor
ratjadone C (5 nmol/L). Cell cultures were then exposed to the topo
II–targeted agents VP-16 (10 Amol/L) for 8 h or doxorubicin
(2 Amol/L) for 4 h and assayed for apoptosis with a caspase-3 assay
(BD Pharmingen). In addition, to show whether the ratjadone C/
doxorubicin and the ratjadone C/VP-16 synergistic activities were
because of topo IIa nuclear localization, cells were transfected with
a siRNA to knockdown topo IIa expression (Fig. 3C). Topo IIa
knockdown was >90% when assayed by Western blot (Fig. 3C,
inset). In myeloma cell lines, with both topo II inhibitors
(doxorubicin and VP-16), we found that knockdown of topo IIa
protein expression reversed the synergistic effect and reduced
apoptosis to untreated levels (4-12% apoptosis; Fig. 3C).
CRM1 siRNA sensitizes myeloma cells to topo IIA poisons. In
addition to CRM1 pharmacologic modification by a chemical
agent, we used a CRM1-specific siRNA to determine whether we
could reproduce the observed synergistic activity in another model

Figure 3. CRM1 inhibitor sensitizes myeloma cells to doxorubicin.
A, human myeloma cell lines 8226, H929, and U266 (2  106 cells/mL)
were incubated with the CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C (RDC ; 5 nmol/L) for 16 h.
Cells were then treated with doxorubicin (Dox ; 2 Amol/L) for 4 h and
assayed for caspase-3 staining by flow cytometry. Cell lines were assayed in
triplicate, and data from each drug combination were pooled. Ratjadone C
versus control samples are statistically different (P = 0.006) in A
(control = 1.50% and ratjadone C = 3.84%). Ratjadone C was found to
significantly (P = 0.00005) sensitize cells to doxorubicin. B, CRM1 inhibitor
sensitizes ex vivo patient myeloma cells to doxorubicin. Bone marrow
aspirates (n = 7) obtained from multiple myeloma patients were treated with
ratjadone C (5 nmol/L) for 16 h followed by doxorubicin (2 Amol/L) for 4 h and
assayed for cleaved caspase-3 to determine apoptosis. Cells (4  106/mL)
treated with ratjadone C only were significantly different (P = 0.03) from
untreated cells (control = 4.97% and ratjadone C = 14.31%). Cells
(4  106/mL) treated with both ratjadone C and doxorubicin were significantly
(P = 0.0003) more sensitive to doxorubicin (3-fold) than doxorubicin alone.
C, mechanism of CRM1 and topo IIa inhibitor synergy. Human myeloma
cell lines (n = 9) were incubated at high density (2  106/mL) for 16 h with the
CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C (5 nmol/L). Cell cultures were then exposed
to the topo II–targeted agents VP-16 (10 Amol/L) for 8 h or doxorubicin
(2 Amol/L) for 4 h and assayed for apoptosis with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay (BD Pharmingen). CRM1
inhibition by ratjadone C increased the effectiveness of DNA-damaging agents
to induce apoptosis. This effect was significant for doxorubicin/ratjadone C
(P = 0.00019) and VP-16/ratjadone C (P = 0.0185). When topo IIa protein
was reduced by topo IIa siRNA knockdown, apoptosis was substantially
decreased, suggesting that apoptosis is topo IIa dependent.

then treated with doxorubicin (2 Amol/L) for 4 h and assayed for
apoptosis by caspase-3 staining with the use of flow cytometry
(n = 3 for each cell line). Figure 3A shows that myeloma cells were
rendered more sensitive to the topo II inhibitor by inhibition of
CRM1 export with ratjadone C. Figure 3A to C illustrates that high
cell density–induced drug resistance is reversed by the CRM1
inhibitor ratjadone C. Ratjadone C is a potent inhibitor of CRM1
and prevents nuclear export by alkylating the active site Cys528 amino
acid residue of CRM1 (17). Ratjadone C has been shown to have

the use of flow cytometry. CRM1 knockdown rendered plateau-density cells

CRM1 Inhibition and Drug Sensitivity

Figure 5. Band depletion and comet assay. A, band depletion assay of the
combination of ratjadone C (RDC) and VP-16 produced more DNA-topo IIa
complexes, depleting the topo IIa band in the Western blot analysis. These data
indicate that blocking nuclear export of topo IIa will increase the effectiveness of
VP-16 and induce apoptosis. B, comet assay of plateau-density H929 cells
treated with ratjadone C (5 nmol/L) for 16 h and then with VP-16 (10 Amol/L) for
60 min. The comet moment of cells (50 per experiment) was assayed in two
separate experiments for each drug combination and control samples. Comet
assay is a measure of DNA cleavage (22). The CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C
increased DNA cleavage compared to the topo II inhibitor VP-16 alone
(P = 0.0006).

system. H929 cells were transfected by electroporation with a
CRM1-specific siRNA (Fig. 4). After transfection, the cells were
incubated at log-phase densities for 24 h to allow CRM1 siRNAmediated knockdown and then concentrated at plateau-phase
conditions for an additional 16 h. CRM1 knockdown cells grown at
high density for 16 h were then treated with the topo II inhibitor

doxorubicin (2 Amol/L) for 4 h and assayed for apoptosis by
Annexin V staining using flow cytometry (Fig. 4). CRM1 knockdown
was found to increase the effectiveness of doxorubicin. Myeloma
cell line 8226 showed similar results (data not shown). To show
efficient siRNA knockdown, SDS lysates of equal cell numbers were
assayed for CRM1 by Western blot (Fig. 4, inset).
Increase in cleavable complex formation by CRM1 inhibition. VP-16 stabilizes DNA-topo IIa adducts, resulting in doublestranded DNA breaks. We speculated that, when topo IIa is kept in
the nucleus by ratjadone C, a greater number of DNA-topo IIa
complexes would be observed. To assay this potential effect, several
band depletion assays were done (n = 3). Band depletion assays can
assess the amount of topo IIa-DNA covalent complexes formed in
intact cells. Large covalent complexes will have decreased
migration into a SDS-PAGE gel; therefore, the amount of topo
IIa, as measured by Western blot, will be depleted. VP-16 alone did
not produce significant band depletion; however, when used
together with ratjadone C, we saw a large depletion at both 25 and
50 Amol/L VP-16 concentrations (Fig. 5A). These data indicate that
blocking nuclear export of topo IIa will increase the effectiveness
of VP-16 and induce apoptosis by increased cleavable complexes.
Comet assay. Plateau-density H929 cells were treated with
5 nmol/L ratjadone C for 16 h and then with 10 Amol/L VP-16 for
60 min. DNA fragmentation was measured by the neutral comet
assay. The CRM1 inhibitor ratjadone C increased the DNA cleavage
induced by the topo II inhibitor VP-16 (Fig. 5B). Increased DNA
fragmentation led to increased apoptosis in cells treated with both
VP-16 and ratjadone C.
Ratjadone C does not sensitize H929 human myeloma cell
lines to other myeloma drugs. H929 myeloma cells were exposed
to ratjadone C and various additional drug combinations (Fig. 6),
including the alkylating agent melphalan and proteosome inhibitor
Velcade. We found that CRM1 inhibition will sensitize myeloma
cells to the topo II inhibitors doxorubicin (P = 0.00005) and VP-16
(P = 0.02), but it did not significantly sensitizes myeloma cells
treated with melphalan (P = 0.35) or Velcade (P = 0.30).

Discussion
The intracellular location of a protein may be at least as
important as its expression. Diseases as dissimilar as cystic fibrosis
(23), schizophrenia (24), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (25), and
many types of cancers, as reviewed previously (26, 27), may be

(4  106) with and without 5 nmol/L ratjadone C (RDC) and incubated for 16 h (n = 4 for each cell line). Cells were then incubated for 4 h with one of the following:
2 Amol/L doxorubicin, 10 Amol/L VP-16, 10 Amol/L melphalan, or 10 Amol/L Velcade. CRM1 inhibition by ratjadone C sensitized myeloma cells to the topo IIa
inhibitors doxorubicin (P = 0.00005) and VP-16 (P = 0.02) but not myeloma cells treated with melphalan (P = 0.35) or Velcade (P = 0.30).

caused by intracellular mislocalization of individual proteins.
Specific examples of proteins that must be in the nucleus to
prevent cancer initiation, progression, or chemotherapeutic
response include p53 (reviewed previously in ref. 28), galectin-3
(29), FOXO (30), INI1/hSNPF5 (31), p27Kip1 (32), p21Cip1 (33),
and topo IIa (8–10). Mislocalization of a protein can render it
ineffective as a tumor suppressor or as a target for chemotherapy.
However, it is possible that blocking nuclear export of any or all of
these proteins may induce tumor suppression or apoptosis or, in
the case of topo IIa, may reverse drug resistance to topo IIa
inhibitors. This may be true in multiple myeloma where the cells
possess a CRM1-mediated mechanism in which topo IIa is
exported from the nucleus and away from the DNA, rendering
topo II inhibitors ineffective to produce cleavable complexes and
DNA strand breaks.
In previous reports, our group has shown that myeloma cells,
under high-density conditions, will export topo IIa into the
cytoplasm both in vivo and in vitro (8–10). We found that nuclear
export of topo IIa contributes to drug resistance (9) and that the
resistance was not due to differences in drug uptake, cell cycle, or
total cellular topo IIa protein levels. In addition, topo IIa nuclear
export has been shown to be CRM1 mediated, and topo IIa protein
has been found to contain two functional nuclear export signals at
amino acids 1,017 to 1,028 and 1,054 to 1,066 (10). Export by both
signals was blocked by treatment of the cells with leptomycin B,
indicating that a CRM1-dependent pathway mediates export (10).
Leptomycin B has been shown to be too toxic for clinical use (12);
however, less toxic CRM1 inhibitors such as ratjadone C and others
compounds, as identified in a recent publication, may soon become
available (13).
In this study, we showed that myeloma cells grown at high
density are highly resistant to topo II–directed chemotherapeutic
drugs (Fig. 1A) and that drug resistance correlated with nuclear
export of topo IIa (Figs. 1B and 2). Based on these data, we
proposed that blocking CRM1-mediated export of topo IIa may
make myeloma cells more sensitive to topo II–active agents. To
evaluate whether blocking topo IIa export would sensitize cells, we
knocked down CRM1 mRNA and protein expression in cells by
transfection with CRM1-specific siRNAs and by using the CRM1inhibiting drug ratjadone C. Ratjadone C was used in this study
because it is a potent inhibitor of CRM1, has been shown to have
anticancer properties, and has reduced toxicity in vitro compared
to leptomycin B when used at low concentrations (14, 16–18).

CRM1 inhibition by siRNA and ratjadone C in human myeloma
cells was found to prevent nuclear export of topo IIa in plateaudensity cell cultures (Figs. 1B and 2). Depletion or inhibition of
CRM1 by siRNA or ratjadone C caused high-density myeloma cells
to become 4-fold more sensitive to the topo II inhibitors
doxorubicin and VP-16 as measured by apoptosis (Fig. 3A-C).
Depletion of topo IIa protein by specific topo IIa siRNA
knockdown reversed this synergistic effect, indicating that topo
IIa was the targeted molecule for CRM1 synergistic activity
(Fig. 3C). In addition, we found that blocking CRM1-mediated
export sensitized patient myeloma cells obtained from bone
marrow aspirates to the topo II poison doxorubicin. Normal
peripheral blood mononuclear cells were not sensitized by CRM1
inhibition. It is likely that these cells were not sensitized because
they are not replicating at a high rate, unlike the myeloma cells,
which double approximately every 24 h. In addition, normal cells
do not export topo IIa; therefore, ratjadone C treatment would not
affect intracellular localization.
When additional drugs were used in combination with ratjadone
C, we found that myeloma cells were sensitized to the topo II
inhibitors doxorubicin and VP-16 but not to the alkylating agent
melphalan or to the proteosome inhibitor Velcade (Fig. 6).
In conclusion, maintaining topo IIa in the nucleus by inhibition
of CRM1 greatly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of the topo II
inhibitors doxorubicin and VP-16 in high-density myeloma cells.
Band depletion assays indicated that more DNA-topo IIa complexes were stabilized in cells when CRM1 was inhibited (Fig. 5A),
and these increased cleavable complexes resulted in increased
strand breaks as measured by the comet assay (Fig. 5B) and
subsequent apoptosis. These findings may have potential therapeutic value in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
