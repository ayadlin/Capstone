death and promote anti-tumor immunity

The poor efﬁcacy of the in vivo anti-tumor immune response has been partially attributed to ineffective T-cell responses mounted
against the tumor. Fas-FasL-dependent activation-induced cell death (AICD) of T cells is believed to be a major contributor to
compromised anti-tumor immunity. The molecular mechanisms of AICD are well-investigated, yet the possibility of regulating AICD
for cancer therapy remains to be explored. In this study, we show that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) can inhibit apoptosis
of CD4+ T cells within the tumor, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immune responses and suppressing melanoma growth. This
inhibitory effect is speciﬁc for AICD through suppressing NFAT1-regulated FasL expression on activated CD4+ T cells. In gld/gld mice
with mutation in FasL, the beneﬁcial effect of HDACIs on AICD of inﬁltrating CD4+ T cells is not seen, conﬁrming the critical role of
FasL regulation in the anti-tumor effect of HDACIs. Importantly, we found that the co-administration of HDACIs and anti-CTLA4
could further enhance the inﬁltration of CD4+ T cells and achieve a synergistic therapeutic effect on tumor. Therefore, our study
demonstrates that the modulation of AICD of tumor-inﬁltrating CD4+ T cells using HDACIs can enhance anti-tumor immune
responses, uncovering a novel mechanism underlying the anti-tumor effect of HDACIs.

INTRODUCTION
Tumors are composed of many different cell types, among which
immune cells are claimed to play a critical role in controlling
tumor growth.1 During tumor development, immune cells,
especially tumor-inﬁltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), secrete an array
of cytokines that can kill tumor cells directly.2 Owing to the
important role of immune system in eliminating potential tumor
cells, immunotherapy is considered as a very promising strategy
for treating tumors. For instance, the adoptive transfer of TILs has
been shown to dramatically enhance tumor rejection in some
settings.3,4 Furthermore, antibodies against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been shown to be
very effective in treating cancers, a result of enhanced anti-tumor
immunity by TILs.5–7
However, tumor cells are not always successfully eliminated by
immune responses. One mechanism is that even as T cells
continually migrate into tumor sites, they often undergo apoptosis
prior to being able to carry out their anti-tumor functions.8 Among
the mechanisms underlying T-cell apoptosis, activation-induced
cell death (AICD) is very important as a normal control mechanism
for immune response. AICD was ﬁrst described in 1989 and is
considered critical for regulating T-cell viability and immune
homeostasis.9 We have shown that activated CD4+ T cells undergo
AICD upon re-stimulation. Re-stimulation rapidly induces FasL
(CD95L) expression, and FasL-Fas interaction triggers the
caspase cascade, leading to T-cell apoptosis.9,10 Importantly, the
1

impairment of FasL-Fas pathway in humans affects lymphocyte
apoptosis and leads to the autoimmune lymphoproliferative
syndrome, which is characterized by the accumulation of
activated lymphocytes and autoimmune disease.11 Owing to this
important role of FasL-mediated AICD in controlling immune
response, the possibility of regulating AICD for improved cancer
immunotherapy requires further exploration.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) are small molecules
that inhibit the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs). In recent
years, HDACIs have entered the clinic as anti-tumor drugs.
Vorinostat, a synthetic compound that is structurally similar to
the ﬁrst-described natural HDACI, trichostatin A (TSA), was the ﬁrst
FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor for the treatment of relapsed and
refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Many other HDACIs are
currently in clinical trials, either as mono-therapies or in
combination with conventional chemotherapy.12–14 Still, the
mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects remain
elusive.15 Interestingly, substantial evidence has shown that
HDACIs can induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types through
different mechanisms.16,17 The role of HDACIs in AICD is unclear,
however, and whether this role contributes to their potential
utility in tumor therapy remains to be determined.
In this study, we employed TSA, and found that it signiﬁcantly
suppressed the growth of B16F0 melanoma through inhibiting
apoptosis of activated CD4+ T lymphocytes within tumor.
Furthermore, this effect of TSA was exerted through speciﬁcally
downregulating FasL expression on inﬁltrating CD4+ T cells, which
resulted in enhanced anti-tumor immune response. This role of

FasL was further evidenced by the fact that TSA provided no
beneﬁt in the treatment of tumor-bearing gld/gld mice. Importantly, we found that TSA and CTLA4 antibody acted synergistically to greatly enhance CD4+ T-cell inﬁltration, and together may
offer better tumor therapeutic effects than either agent alone. Our
ﬁndings reveal a novel mechanism underlying the anti-tumor
effect of HDACIs, which is inhibiting AICD of tumor-inﬁltrating
CD4+ T lymphocytes.
RESULTS
TSA inhibits tumor growth by promoting the survival of inﬁltrating
CD4+ T cells
As tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are essential in eliminating tumor cells, we wondered whether HDACIs exert their
therapeutic effect through TILs. We tested this possibility in the
B16F0 melanoma model established on both C57BL/6 mice and
nude mice. To determine the optimal concentration of TSA, two
doses of TSA were administrated; 1 μM/kg (referred to as ‘low
dose’) and 3 μM/kg, the concentration widely used for experimental tumor treatment (referred to as ‘high dose’).18 We found
that in C57BL/6 mice, regardless of concentration, TSA administration resulted in signiﬁcantly smaller tumors compared with
vehicle alone (Figure 1a). Surprisingly, when similar studies were
conducted in nude mice, which lack a thymus and therefore have
no T cells, the therapeutic effect of low-dose TSA was completely
absent whereas the effect of high-dose TSA remained (Figure 1b).
This suggested that the anti-tumor effect of low-dose TSA was
exerted through the immune system, most likely through T cells;
whereas that of high-dose TSA was independent of T-cell
immunity, possibly by directly inducing tumor cell death as
previously reported.18 To test these possibilities, we ﬁrst employed
Rag1−/−mice, which have no T lymphocytes. As expected, there
was no anti-tumor effect at low-dose TSA (Figure 1c). Next, we
stimulated B16F0 cells with different concentrations of TSA in vitro
and found as high as 200 nM TSA could indeed induce tumor cell
death (Supplementary Figure 1). As lower TSA concentrations
should induce fewer side effects and be less toxic, we adopted
1 μM/kg TSA for the subsequent experiments.
To identify which subset of T cells is essential for the anti-tumor
effect of TSA, we employed CIITA−/− mice that have no CD4+
T cells, and β2m − / − mice that lack CD8+ T cells. Interestingly,
without CD4+ T cells, low-dose TSA had no effect; in the absence
of CD8+ T cells, however, TSA did exert signiﬁcant therapeutic
effect (Figure 1d). Therefore, CD4+ T cells are indispensable for the
anti-tumor effect of TSA.
Owing to the important role of CD4+ T cells, we next explored
the inﬁltration of activated CD4+ T lymphocytes within the tumor
microenvironment in wild-type mice. Interestingly, TSA administration resulted in signiﬁcant increases in the fraction of CD4+
CD62L − activated T cells in tumor tissue (Figure 1e). Besides,
histological analysis also showed elevated inﬁltration of T cells in
tumor (Supplementary Figure 2). Most of these cells were also
positive for CD44, which is an indicative marker for effector
memory T cells (Supplementary Figure 3). More importantly, the
absolute number of these cells per gram of tumor also increased
(Figure 1f). We further isolated CD4+ CD62L − cells from tumor and
tested the expression of cytokines associated with T cell activation,
including interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF). We found that TSA could signiﬁcantly increase
the expression of these cytokines (Figure 1g). Elevated serum
levels of these cytokines were also detected (Supplementary
Figure 4). Taken together, TSA administration results in increased
CD4+ T cells within tumor tissue, which leads to enhanced antitumor immune responses and constrained tumor growth.

To further explore the reasons responsible for the increased
activated CD4+ T cells, we examined the apoptotic status of these
cells within tumor. Interestingly, we found that the TSA treatment
dramatically reduced CD4+ T cell death, as revealed by their
permeability to 7-AAD (Figure 1h). Therefore, TSA administration
increased the number of activated CD4+ T cells within the tumor
possibly through inhibiting apoptosis.
HDAC inhibition promotes the survival of T-cell hybridoma by
blocking AICD
As we demonstrated, TILs undergo decreased apoptosis in
response to TSA treatment. As AICD is one of the major
mechanisms underlying the apoptosis of TILs, we hypothesize
that this is through the inhibition of AICD happening in tumor
microenvironment. To this end, we examined the effect of HDAC
inhibition on AICD in vitro. We employed A1.1 cells, a T-cell
hybridoma that is well established for the investigation of AICD in
T lymphocytes.19 AICD of A1.1 cells was induced by TCR ligation
using immobilized anti-CD3. The addition of TSA at doses of 50–
100 nM resulted in a striking reduction in AICD (Figures 2a and b), a
sharp contrast to previous reports of the pro-apoptotic role of
TSA.16 TSA alone showed no effect on the survival of A1.1 cells
(Supplementary Figure 5). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of
TSA was apparent soon after re-activation (Figure 2c). To
corroborate these ﬁndings, we employed another HDACI,
sodium butyrate (NaBu), and observed similar results
(Supplementary Figure 6). To conﬁrm that cell death was indeed
reduced by TSA treatment, we measured cell viability using
CCK-8 and found a nearly complete reversal of cell death by TSA
(Figure 2d). Therefore, inhibition of HDAC activity using HDACIs
can protect T cells from AICD and thereby greatly promote their
survival.
HDACIs suppress TCR-initiated FasL expression in T-cell hybridoma
TILs may be susceptible to other types of apoptosis besides
AICD; therefore, we next examined the effect of TSA on
apoptosis induced by other stimuli. A1.1 cells were exposed
to actinomycin D (ActD), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or UV
irradiation, which are all reported to induce tumor cell
death, each through a different mechanism.20,21 Interestingly,
following these cellular insults, TSA treatment did not
reduce the proportion of apoptotic cells in A1.1 cell cultures
(Figure 3a). Moreover, TSA could not inhibit A1.1 cell death
induced by serum deprivation. Thus, TSA could not block
growth factor withdrawal-induced T-cell death, one of the
mechanisms underlying T-cell death within the tumor
microenvironment22,23 (Figure 3b). Also, levels of Bim, the
molecule mediating growth factor withdrawal-induced T-cell
death, were unaffected in the presence of TSA (Figure 3c).
Therefore, the inhibitory effect of TSA is speciﬁc to AICD.
It has been shown in A1.1 cells that TCR re-stimulation induces
FasL expression, leading to Fas ligation and resultant apoptosis.10,24
To this end, we next examined the effects of TSA on FasL
expression. We found that TSA completely blocked FasL upregulation at both mRNA and protein levels (Figures 3b and c). Similarly,
NaBu was also found to inhibit FasL expression (Supplementary
Figure 7). When CD90 (Thy-1) antibody was used to activate
A1.1 cells, we again found that TSA completely inhibited
subsequent FasL expression and apoptosis (Supplementary
Figure 8), providing further evidence that HDACIs exert their
anti-apoptotic effect by preventing FasL upregulation. In contrast,
Fas expression was not suppressed by HDACIs; instead, HDACIs
enhanced Fas in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3d). To further
verify the role of FasL in the inhibitory effect of TSA on AICD, we
next employed the FasL mimic Jo2. As expected, TSA did not
inhibit Jo2-induced cell death (Figure 3e), indicating that the Fas
response is unimpeded by TSA; rather, it is the lack of FasL that

prevents AICD. Interestingly, we found that in the presence of Jo2,
a Fas-activating antibody, TSA dramatically increased the apoptotic rate of A1.1 cells, a ﬁnding which may be explained by the
elevated level of Fas expression observed following TSA treatment. These results demonstrate that HDACIs inhibit FasL
expression by activated A1.1cells, which, despite the increased
Fas expression, leads to complete inhibition of AICD.

TSA protects primary CD4+ T cells from AICD by inhibiting FasL
expression
We have shown above that HDAC inhibitors can dramatically
suppress AICD of A1.1 cells by inhibiting the expression of FasL. To
extend this ﬁnding to physiologically more relevant primary CD4+
T cells, we generated CD4+ T cell blasts. We found that the AICD of
CD4+ T-cell blasts was also suppressed by TSA (Figures 4a and b),

Figure 2. Inhibition of HDAC protects T cells from AICD and promotes their survival. (a) A1.1 T cell hybridoma cells were cultured in the
presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of TSA in 24-well plates that had been previously coated with anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) to
induce AICD. After 24 h, cells were harvested and DNA content was revealed by staining with propidium iodide and analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry to determine the proportion of subdiploid cells (representative experiment). (b) The statistical results of three separate experiments

separate experiments performed in duplicate wells, for this and all other ﬁgures, unless otherwise indicated.

whereas TSA alone showed no effect (Supplementary Figure 9),
similar to the T-cell hybridoma results. Signiﬁcant inhibition
occurred at a dose as low as 10 nM and complete inhibition
required only 25 nM TSA. Furthermore, during AICD, FasL and Fas
were regulated by TSA much as they were in A1.1 cells (Figures 4c
and d). Thus, TSA similarly inhibits AICD in both primary CD4+
T cells and A1.1 hybridoma cells through the regulation of FasL
expression.
TSA inhibits FasL expression by regulating NFAT1 and Egr2
It is well known that TCR activation triggers two separate
pathways, calcium/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)
signaling and PKC signaling.25 It has been proposed that NFAT1
(NFATp, NFATc2) and PKC are both required for the expression of
FasL, whereas Fas expression needs only PKC.26–28 As TSA
speciﬁcally inhibits FasL but not Fas, we examined the activity of
the key molecule, NFAT1. Cytoplasmic and nuclear exacts were
prepared from anti-CD3 re-activated A1.1 cells to examine the
distribution of NFAT1. We found that with high concentrations of
TSA, nucleus-associated NFAT1 was decreased, but not p53 or p65,
which both regulate Fas expression during AICD29,30 (Figure 5a,
Supplementary Figure 10). These ﬁndings indicate that the
inhibitory effect of TSA on FasL expression is closely related to
the speciﬁc suppression of NFAT1 activity.
It has been reported that NFAT1 translocation induces
expression of early growth factor 2 and 3 (Egr2/3), which would
directly bind to the FasL promoter and launch FasL expression.28
Accordingly, to verify the effect of TSA on NFAT1 translocation, we
next examined Egr2/3 expression. We found that TSA inhibited the
expression of NFAT-induced Egr2, but not Egr3, indicating that
Egr2 rather than Egr3 is the critical regulator of FasL in A1.1 cells
(Figure 5b). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TSA
exerts its effect on transcription factors that are known to regulate
FasL expression.

TSA inhibits apoptosis of CD4+ T cells in tumors by suppressing
FasL expression
We have demonstrated in vitro that the anti-apoptotic effects of
HDACIs result from inhibition of FasL expression. To determine
whether this effect is responsible for decreased apoptosis of CD4+
T cells following TSA administration in vivo, we speciﬁcally
examined FasL expression by tumor-inﬁltrating CD4+ T cells, and
found that TSA treatment dramatically reduced the expression of
FasL on these cells (Figure 6a). This shows that TSA indeed inhibits
the FasL-mediated AICD of tumor-inﬁltrating CD4+ T cells in vivo. To
further verify that this phenomenon was responsible for the
therapeutic effect of TSA, we again utilized the B16F0 melanoma
model and compared the effects of TSA on resultant tumor mass in
both wild-type and gld/gld mice, in which FasL is mutated. We
found that the therapeutic effect of TSA that was apparent in the
wild-type mice and was completely absent in gld/gld mice
(Figure 6b). Similarly, in gld/gld mice, TSA did not increase the
number or percentage of CD4+ T cells in the tumor, or the serum
level of T-cell cytokines (Figures 6c and e). Furthermore, the AICD of
CD4+ T cells was unaffected by TSA in gld/gld mice (Figure 6f). Thus,
the inhibition of FasL-mediated AICD by TSA is crucial for its ability
to boost the numbers of inﬁltrating T lymphocytes. This conclusion
was further supported by the ﬁnding that the lack of FasL in gld/gld
mice also led to greater numbers of tumor-inﬁltrating T cells and
smaller tumors, as compared with wild-type mice.
To test whether this phenomenon can be generalized to other
tumor types, we employed EL4 lymphoma model and obtained
results similar to those with melanoma: EL4 lymphoma growth
was suppressed by TSA administration, and inﬁltration by CD4+ T
lymphocytes was enhanced in wild-type mice, but not in gld/gld
mice (Supplementary Figure 11).
The combined administration of TSA and CTLA4 antibody achieves
better anti-tumor effect
It has been reported that HDACIs have a much stronger
therapeutic effect when combined with other anti-tumor

agents.31 CTLA4 antibody has been shown to be effective in the
treatment of several types of cancers, especially melanoma, owing
to its ability to enhance the T-lymphocyte response.32 Therefore,
we reasoned that combining TSA and anti-CTLA4 might have a
synergistic therapeutic effect. To test this, anti-CTLA4 was coadministered with TSA in the B16 melanoma model. As expected,
the combination of these two agents prolonged the survival of
tumor-bearing mice to a much greater extent than did either
alone (Figure 7a). Co-administration of TSA and anti-CTLA4 also
showed a stronger anti-tumor effect, limiting melanoma growth
more than TSA or anti-CTLA4 alone (Figure 7b). Furthermore,
although the percentage of activated CD4+ CD62L − T lymphocytes in the tumors was no greater with the combined treatment,
the absolute number of these cells was strikingly increased
compared with either treatment alone (Figure 7c and d). Taken
together, these results demonstrate that TSA and CTLA4 antibody
can act synergistically to increase the number of activated CD4+ T
lymphocytes, compared with either alone, resulting in a more
potent therapeutic effect on melanoma growth. This ﬁnding has

great potential to guide the clinical application of HDACIs in the
treatment of cancer.
DISCUSSION
For the past two decades, a large number of HDAC inhibitors have
been puriﬁed from natural sources, and others have been
synthesized.12 In recent years, accumulating evidence has
demonstrated that HDACIs have promising therapeutic potential
for the treatment of various tumors.12–14 At least two such agents
(Vorinostat and Romidepsin) have been approved by the FDA, and
many others are under clinical trial.33 Still, the mechanisms
underlying the therapeutic effects of HDACIs remain elusive.
There is substantial evidence that tumor cells can induce FasFasL-mediated apoptosis of TILs as a way to escape immune
surveillance.2,8 In fact, the restoration of TIL function within tumor
by inhibition of apoptosis has been adopted as a therapeutic
strategy and found to dramatically improve tumor rejection.3,34
Therefore, the apoptotic status of TILs is closely related to tumor

In our studies, we have shown that HDACIs can inhibit the
apoptosis of activated T cells. In recent years, however, there has
arisen substantial evidence suggesting that HDACIs can themselves induce T-cell death.35,36 These reports are inconsistent with
our ﬁndings. We noticed, however, that the inﬁltrating cells
responsible for attacking tumors are mostly activated functional
T cells, and little has been reported about the effect of HDACIs on
activated T cells. To our knowledge, our current study is the ﬁrst to
report that HDACIs have an anti-apoptotic effect on activated T
lymphocytes. Furthermore, our studies suggested that the antiapoptotic effects of HDACIs on the activated T cells were observed
at lower concentrations of the drug, whereas we also observed
direct induction of tumor cell apoptosis at higher levels. It is
possible that both the activation state of the CD4+ T cells, as well

as the dose of HDACI used may determine whether HDACIs exert
pro- or anti-apoptotic effects in T cells.
We have demonstrated the anti-apoptotic effect of HDACIs on
tumor-inﬁltrating CD4+ T cells resulted from inhibition FasL
expression following re-activation. The Fas-FasL interaction is
known to mediate the AICD of Th1 cells, whereas the major
regulator of AICD of Th2 cells is granzyme B.37,38 We found that
granzyme B expression on TILs was not changed by TSA treatment
like FasL (data not shown), suggesting that TSA may preferentially
suppress AICD in Th1 CD4+ cells. Interestingly, increased numbers
of activated Th1 cells are reported to be associated with
prolonged disease-free survival in various tumor models and
human cancers; whereas Th2 cells are associated with cancer
progression and metastasis.39–41 Therefore, it is possible that the

anti-tumor effect of HDACIs may be due to inhibition of FasLmediated apoptosis of Th1 cells, but this hypothesis remains to be
further tested.
HDACIs inhibit the activity of multiple HDACs. Among the 11
classical HDACs, nearly half of them have been reported to
regulate cell death. Inhibition of either HDAC1 or HDAC2 was
reported to be associated with increased apoptosis in human
cancer cells.42 Also, an HDAC8-speciﬁc inhibitor was shown to
selectively induce apoptosis in T-cell-derived lymphoma and
leukemic cells, but not in solid cancer cell lines.42 On the other
hand, Bolger et al.43 claimed that inhibition of HDAC4 could
suppress cell death. Especially, HDAC7 was reported to be
exported to the cytoplasm of T cells after TCR activation and
mutation in HDAC7 inhibits its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and
suppresses TCR-induced apoptosis.44 Owing to the strong
similarity between HDAC7 and FasL in both expression pattern
and functional effects on T-cell apoptosis, we considered that
HDAC7 may be a candidate FasL regulator. In fact, we examined
the expression of HDAC7 in A1.1 cells during AICD induction and
found that it was upregulated by anti-CD3 ligation and suppressed
by HDACI treatment, much as was FasL expression, further
indicating a possible relationship between HDAC7 and FasL (data
not shown). However, the speciﬁc HDACs responsible for the
regulation of FasL remain obscure and need to be identiﬁed.
In our study, we have shown that the inhibitory effect of TSA on
FasL expression is related to decreased NFAT activity. Such
inhibition can result in the suppression of AICD of T cells. As a

well-known NFAT inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA) can suppress T-cell
activation45 and FasL expression during AICD.9 CsA has been
widely used as an immunosuppressant for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis or inﬂammation induced by organ
transplantation.46,47 Moreover, its application can promote tumor
growth by suppressing the overall immune surveillance by T
cells.48 The differences between TSA- and CsA-mediated effects on
tumors most likely can be attributed to their different regulatory
effects on T cells. Unlike CsA, when TSA inhibits the progression of
AICD, it shows no inhibitory effect on the proliferation of T cells by
the same concentration (data not shown). Our results suggest that
this regulation is the potential mechanism mediating tumor
inhibition by TSA. Compared with TSA, in addition to its wellknown suppression on T cells, CsA is also known to regulate
cancer progression via promoting transforming growth factor beta
(TGFβ), through a mechanism independent of host immunity.49
Therefore, the mechanism underlying the different effects of CsA
and TSA on tumor growth needs further exploration.
Our studies have proven that FasL inhibition results in increased
numbers of tumor-inﬁltrating T cells, which is the basis of the antitumor effect of TSA. FasL expression by tumor cells is also one of
the mechanisms underlying the death of tumor-inﬁltrating
lymphocytes.8 However, we found that the expression of FasL
on B16F0 cells is very low and TSA shows no inhibitory effect on its
expression (data not shown). In 2002, it was reported that the
main anti-tumor mechanism of TSA was Fas ligation-induced
tumor cell death.18 If that were the case, however, then tumor

mass in our gld/gld mice would be expected to be even greater
than that in wild-type mice, as gld/gld mice should have less
tumor cell death. Instead, our studies show that tumor growth was
suppressed in gld/gld mice compared with wild-type mice, a result
that we attribute to the elevated numbers of inﬁltrating T cells. Of
note, Maecker et al.18 inoculated with MEF cells rather than
melanoma cells to induce murine tumors, and it might be possible
that TSA exerts its anti-tumor effect through different mechanisms
in different types of tumors. Furthermore, the concentration of
TSA Maecker et al. used was around 3 μM/kg, whereas in our
experiment, we employed much less concentration to 1 μM/kg. We
have already shown that high-dose TSA could indeed induce
tumor cell death, which is consistent with their results. Overall, we
believe the anti-tumor effect of HDACIs is due, at least in part, to
enhanced T lymphocyte survival within tumor. Nevertheless, the
details of the mechanism need to be further investigated.
In conclusion, the results presented here support the following
scenario: HDAC inhibitors suppress the apoptosis of activated
T lymphocytes by inhibiting their expression of FasL, thus
enhancing their survival. This leads to increased numbers of
activated T cells within tumor, thereby enhancing anti-tumor
immunity and constraining tumor growth. Thus, we have
proposed a new mechanism by which HDACIs exert their
therapeutic effects in cancer. With further study and a more
complete understanding of how HDACIs regulate T lymphocyte
survival, the use of HDACIs can be exploited for broader and more
effective cancer therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
C57BL/6 and nude mice were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory
Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China, and
maintained under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions. Rag1 − / − mice, gld/
gld mice, CIITA − / − mice and β2m − / − mice were obtained from Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice were housed in the Vivarium of
Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. All procedures were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of
Chinese Academy of Sciences. Animals were matched for age and gender
in each experiment.

Antibodies and reagents
TSA, sodium butyrate, propidium iodide, actinomycin D and dimethyl
sulfoxide were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Mouse CD90 (Thy-1)
functional grade puriﬁed antibody, recombinant mouse IL-2, anti-mouse
CD3 FITC, anti-mouse CD4 PerCP-Cyanine 5.5, anti-mouse CD4 PE, antimouse CD62L APC, anti-7-AAD PerCP-Cyanine5.5 and anti-mouse CD95
(Fas) PE were from eBiosciences (La Jolla, CA, USA). Anti-CD95 (Jo2) was

cell blasts were generated as follows. Naïve splenocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml)
were cultured on plastic-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 for 48 h.
These cells were harvested, and CD4+ T cells were isolated by mouse CD4+
T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), and then
cultured with IL-2 (200 U/ml, R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA) alone for 48 h. All
cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 50 mM β-ME (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). B16F0
mouse melanoma cells and EL4 lymphoma cells were cultured in DMEM
medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.

AICD induction
A1.1 T cell hybridoma cells or CD4+ T cell blasts (1 × 106 cells/ml) were
activated on plastic-bound anti-CD3 in 12-well plates for various times. Cell
viability following AICD induction was determined by culture with the
prescribed reagent in the Cell Counting Kit-8 (Beyotime Biotechnology,
Shanghai, China) for 2 h following the manufacturer's instructions, and the
optical density at 450 nm was measured for the supernatant.

Flow cytometric analysis
Cells were suspended at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml (in phosphatebuffered saline with 2% FBS) and 200 μl of suspension was incubated with
propidium iodide staining buffer (0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1%
saponin in phosphate-buffered saline) or ﬂuorescently labeled antibodies
for 30 min. Antibody-stained cells were washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline. Fluorescence intensity was measured by ﬂow cytometry
(BD FACSCalibur, BD Bioscience, Shanghai, China).

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using RNAprep pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (Tiangen
biotech, Beijing, China). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using
PrimeScript RT Master Mix (TaKaRa Biotech, Dalian, China). The levels of
mRNA of genes of interest were measured by real-time PCR (7900 HT by
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR Green Master Mix
(TaKaRa Biotech). Total amount of mRNA was normalized to endogenous
β-actin mRNA. Sequences of PCR primer pairs were as follows: mouse FasL,

Mouse tumor model
For the melanoma model, each mouse was injected with 0.4 × 106 B16F0 in
100 ml phosphate-buffered saline intramuscularly on the left thigh on day 1.
In the TSA dosing experiment, 1 μM/kg or 3 μM/kg TSA was administrated
intraperitoneally to C57BL/6 or nude mice every other day starting on day
6, with dimethyl sulfoxide serving as a vehicle control. In other
experiments, melanoma was established as described and 1 μM/kg TSA
was administrated with or without 200 μg/ml anti-CTLA4 antibodies. Mice
were observed daily and killed when tumor began to signiﬁcantly affect
mobility or 41000 mm3. Cytokine levels in serum were determined by
multiplexed bead immunoassay using the Luminex Technology (Bio-Plex,
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The melanoma tumors were
excised and weighed and mechanically minced, then separated by
discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. Brieﬂy, cells were pelleted,
resuspended in 70% Percoll (GE healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA), overlaid
with 30% Percoll, and then centrifuged at 2000 r.p.m. for 20 min at room
temperature. Lymphocytes were aspirated from the interface and washed
twice with medium. CD4+CD62L − lymphocytes were isolated by mouse
CD4+CD62L − T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Four micrometer parafﬁn sections were prepared and stained
with indicated antibody according to the protocol provided by the
manufacturer. For the EL4 lymphoma model, the cells and TSA were
injected as in the B16 model. The resultant tumors were excised and
weighed, and digested by type I collagenase (0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h,
and lymphocytes were then isolated by Percoll gradient.

Western blotting analysis
For the detection of Bim and P-65 protein, nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins
were extracted using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were heated in sodium dodecyl
sulfate sample buffer at 95 °C for 10 min, separated on a polyacrylamide
gel, and separated proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membranes. Speciﬁc proteins were revealed by mouse and
