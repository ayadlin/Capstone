Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal neoplasm in the gastrointestinal tract and is associated with mutations of the KIT or
PDGFRA gene. In addition, other genetic events are believed to be involved in
GIST tumorigenesis. Cytogenetic aberrations associated with these tumors thus
far described include loss of 1p, 13q, 14q, or 15q, loss of heterozygosity of 22q,
numeric chromosomal imbalances, and nuclear/mitochondrial microsatellite
instability. Molecular genetic aberrations include loss of heterozygosity of
p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), methylation of p15(INK4B), homozygous loss of the
Hox11L1 gene, and amplification of C-MYC, MDM2, EGFR1, and CCND1. GISTs

tion of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases
involves a signal transduction pathway whose components (mitogen-activated
protein kinase, AKT, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin,
and RAS) are also possible targets of inhibition. A new paradigm of classification,
integrating the standard clinical and pathological criteria with molecular aberrations, may permit personalized prognosis and treatment. Cancer 2008;113:153243.  2008 American Cancer Society.

arcomas may be divided into 2 groups based on cytogenetic and
molecular genetic characteristics: those with a frequently diploid
karyotype and limited chromosomal abnormalities but with frequently observed specific translocations and those with complex
karyotypes and multiple cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are generally believed
to belong to the former group and are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The 2 most important prognostic features of primary GISTs are tumor size and mitotic index,
which were the foundation for a consensus approach to risk stratification of GISTs published in 2002. The anatomic location also significantly affects the risk of disease recurrence and progression, and
this is noted in the 2007 National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) risk stratification criteria.1,2

tumor phenotype, and their presence correlates with
benefit from targeted therapy with the kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. To our knowledge, Besmer
et al were the first to demonstrate that v-kit is an
oncogene,3 and it has been demonstrated since then
that germline KIT mutation leads to imatinib-sensitive GISTs in an autosomal dominant pattern.4 Moreover, the identification of KIT and PDGFRA
mutations in GISTs has led to development of imatinib, sunitinib, and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors
for the treatment of solid tumors. The majority of
GISTs have other genetic aberrations in addition to
KIT and PDGFRA mutations. Understanding the
genetic aberrations beyond KIT and PDGFRA may
lead to the identification of additional therapeutic
targets for GISTs and possibly other cancers. Herein
we provide a comprehensive compendium of known
cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in GISTs.

Cytogenetic Aberrations
Loss of chromosome 14 and/or 22 with minimal
recurrent regions in 14q11.2-q32.33 (5 of 7, 71% of
tumors) and 22q12.2-q13.31 (7 of 7, 100%) appears
to play an important role in early stages of tumor
formation as well as in late tumor progression.5-7 In
the report by Wozniak et al, all 66 primary GISTs
examined had genomic imbalances, most frequently
loss of 14q, 1p, 22q, 15q, or 13q. Furthermore, lower
incidence of losses at 14q and higher frequency of
losses at 1p and 15q were the most common findings
in nongastric GISTs. These findings suggest that loss
of 14q is a relatively less frequent genetic event in
the development of nongastric GISTs.8 Chen et al
investigated the chromosomal imbalance aberrations

in 28 GISTs and found that losses were more common than gains. The median number of chromosomal imbalance aberrations in high-risk GISTs was
significantly higher than that in low-risk GISTs, especially for losses. Among the chromosomal imbalance
aberrations, losses of 13q, 10q, and 22q suggest that
these chromosomal loci were most likely to harbor
the tumor suppressor gene(s) that may be related to
early recurrence and/or metastasis during malignant
transformation of GISTs.9 Another investigation
detected nuclear and mitochondrial microsatellite
instability in 3 and 10 of 62 GISTs, respectively, and
the chromosomal numerical abnormality in the primary sites was more extensive in GISTs with recurrence and metastasis than in those without. These
results indicated that mitochondrial microsatellite
instability plays a role in the development of GISTs
and that numeric chromosomal abnormalities may be
a phenotype associated with more aggressive tumors
with a propensity to metastasize and recur locally.10,11
As shown in Table 1, the cytogenetics of GISTs in
some cases is so complex that an oncogenetic tree
model was constructed using comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH) data from 203 primary GISTs.12
The oncogenetic tree model identified 3 major cytogenetic pathways: one is initiated by 214q, the second by 21p, and the third by 222q. The 214q
pathway mainly characterized gastric tumors with
predominantly stable karyotypes and more favorable
clinical course. Conversely, the 21p pathway was
more characteristic of intestinal GISTs, with an
increased capacity for cytogenetic complexity and
more aggressive clinical course. Loss of 22q, which is
more closely associated with 21p than 214q,
appeared to initiate the critical transition to an
unfavorable cytogenetic subpathway.12 Furthermore,

Pylkkanen et al found that allelic losses at 22q were
associated with high mitotic activity and recurring
disease. Thus, insights into the cytogenetic evolution
obtained from oncogenetic tree models may eventually help to improve our understanding of the heterogeneous biological behavior of GISTs.8,13

Molecular Genetic Aberrations of KIT and PDGFRA
Activation of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
is a central pathogenetic event in most GISTs and
generally results from oncogenic, gain-of-function,
in-frame deletions or point mutations that can
involve either the extracellular juxtamembrane or
cytoplasmic domains of the receptor. Oncogenic
mutations enable the KIT receptor to phosphorylate
various substrate proteins, leading to activation of
signal transduction cascades that regulate cell proliferation, survival, chemotaxis, and adhesion (Table 2).
KIT mutations can be assigned broadly to 1 of 2
groups: 1) those that involve the ‘‘regulatory’’ regions
responsible for modulating KIT enzymatic activity

and 2) those that involve the enzymatic region itself.
Published reports indicate that KIT mutations in
untreated GISTs are clustered primarily in 4 exons: 9,
11, 13, and 17. Most common are exon 11 (intracellular juxtamembrane domain) mutations that include
deletions, point mutations, and duplications of the 30
region. Exon 13 and 17 mutations are almost exclusively point mutations and occur in several hot spots,
and the frequency of exon 13 or exon 17 mutations
is no higher than 1% to 2%. Nearly all of the KIT
exon 13 mutations were the 1945A > G substitution
leading to L642G. A majority of the KIT exon 17
mutations were the 2487T > A substitution leading
to A822L. They may be more commonly present in
GISTs of the small bowel, and exon 13 mutation
may predict a more aggressive course in gastric
GISTs.14-19 An A842V substitution in exon 18 is the
most common PDGFRA mutation. GISTs with such
mutation are resistant to imatinib. PDGFRA mutations are associated with gastric GISTs, epithelioid
morphology, and a less malignant course of

disease.18 Recently, with the use of imatinib therapy,
a new class of mutations associated with resistance
to this treatment has been discovered. These are virtually all point mutations that involve a limited number of codons in exons such as 13, 14, 17, and 18 of
KIT and sometimes PDGFRA and are rarely encountered in untreated GISTs. The primary mutations are
retained, but these additional or secondary mutations make the KIT receptor less sensitive to inhibition by imatinib, occasionally by actually affecting
binding of the drug to the cytoplasmic tyrosine
kinase domain.19
GISTs are believed to originate from interstitial
cells of Cajal (ICC) or their precursors. Ogasawara
et al suggested that ICC undergoing KIT mutation as
a possible early initiation step in GIST tumorigenesis
may thus have preneoplastic potential.20 Agaimy
et al also considered that GIST tumorlets represent
the macroscopically recognizable counterpart of sporadic ICC hyperplasia caused by somatic KIT or
PDGFRA mutations.21 In this recent study, 12 of 19
sporadic ICC hyperplasia lesions were investigated
by molecular analysis, and the investigators found 3
KIT exon 11 mutations (2 point mutations and 1 deletion, all involving W557) in 3 cases. Furthermore,
the remarkable variation in the incidence of ICC
hyperplasia at different gastrointestinal sites suggests
an origin from heterogeneous subsets of ICC with
various potentials for neoplastic transformation.22

Molecular Aberrations of Other Genes
More and more genes, including tumor suppressor
genes, have been found to harbor abnormalities in
GISTs that are closely correlated with tumorigenesis,
such as p16 (Table 3). Sabah et al demonstrated that
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with at least 1 microsa-

tellite marker at the 9p region was a common finding
in high-risk GISTs, and recurrent GISTs demonstrated
more frequent deletions than their cognate primary
tumors. These results suggest that loss of the
p16(INK4A) gene on 9p may contribute to the progression and/or malignant transformation of GISTs.23
To assess the involvement of p14ARF and p15INK4B
in addition to p16INK4A in GISTs, Perrone et al
undertook a molecular and cytogenetic study of the
9p21 locus. The results indicated the loss of
p16INK4A mRNA expression in 41% of the GISTs
studied, mainly because of homozygous deletion of
the p16INK4A gene. No mutations were found, and
promoter methylation was restricted mainly to the
p15INK4B gene. Alterations in the 9p21 locus were
found cumulatively in 54% of the tumors in this series and comprised mainly loss of tumor suppressor
gene expression.3,24 These results were further supported by the investigation of Assamaki et al, which
found that most recurrent copy number losses were
localized to 14q, 22q, 1p, and 9p, harboring the
PARP2, APEX1, NDRG2, SIVA, ENO1, and CDKN2A/2B
genes.25 At the same time, it was demonstrated that
the Hox11L1 gene, which is located on chromosome
2 and exerts a role in proliferation of ICC, had homozygous loss in 7 of 72 GISTs. These data implicate
Hox11L1 in the tumorigenesis of GISTs.26
To determine whether known oncogenes take
part in genomic rearrangements and to investigate
the potential clinical significance of their amplifications, the oncogenes C-MYC, MDM2, GLI1, CDK4,
HER2, EGFR1, CCND1, FGF3, and EMS were analyzed
by fluorescent in situ hybridization on a tissue
microarray containing 94 primary GISTs. Amplification was found for C-MYC in 3 of 90 cases, for
MDM2 in 5 of 94, for EGFR1 in 5 of 94, and for

CCND1 in 7 of 79. Amplifications of MDM2 and
CCND1 were associated with clinical and histologic
malignancy. The data show that gene amplification
does occur in a subset of GISTs. MDM2/CCND1
amplification may represent a molecular feature important in the pathogenesis of some GISTs.27 West
et al also characterized gene expression patterns in
GISTs and found that the gene FLJ10261 (DOG1, discovered on GIST-1), encoding a hypothetical protein,
was specifically expressed in GISTs. Immunoreactivity for DOG1 was found in 136 of 139 (97.8%) GISTs;
all 7 GIST cases with a PDGFRA mutation were
DOG1 positive, whereas most of these were KIT negative. These findings suggested the DOG1 may be
involved in GIST tumorigenesis.28,29 Other genes
such as PKC-theta have also proven to be useful markers and may play roles in the development of GISTs;
expression of the obscurin and prune2 genes can
be helpful in differentiating GISTs and leiomyosarcomas.30,31

Molecular Genetic Aberrations
and Clinicopathologic Features
Reports showing that molecular genetic aberrations
in GISTs are correlated with specific cell morphologies and histologic phenotypes are accumulating.
Wardelmann et al provided evidence that GISTs may
be divided into distinctive entities with different
genetic, biological, and phenotypic features. They
found PDGFRA-mutated tumors were preferentially
located in the stomach, whereas GISTs with exon 9
and 13 KIT mutations occurred predominantly in the
small bowel. Furthermore, GISTs carrying PDGFRA
mutations displayed an epithelioid or mixed phenotype, whereas KIT-mutated GISTs almost always
exhibited a spindled or mixed histologic pattern.32
The investigators also found that some mutations
were located in the second kinase domain of
PDGFRA, including 16 point mutations and 4 larger
deletions of 9 to 12 bp. The occurrence of PDGFRA
mutations was significantly associated with a higher
frequency of epithelioid or mixed morphology and
gastric location. These data indicate that GISTs can
be conceptualized as distinctive subsets, differing in
genetic, biologic, and morphologic features.33 Additional studies have confirmed these findings.16,19,34
The correlations between mutation and primary site
by examining expression of KIT and PDGFRA in a
large series of primary GISTs also confirmed the
results. GISTs with KIT mutation had a significantly
higher expression of KIT and at the same time a significantly lower expression of PDGFRA than GISTs
with PDGFRA mutation. With regard to the site of
the primary tumor, gastric GISTs had a significantly

higher expression of PDGFRA and a significantly
lower expression of KIT than intestinal GISTs.
Although GISTs with higher PDGFRA expression constitute only a minority of gastric cases, the higher
PDGFRA expression may contribute to the site-dependent clinical behavior of these tumors.34,35
In summary, exclusive gain-of-function KIT or
PDGFRA mutations occur in a majority of GISTs; these
include in-frame deletions, point mutations, duplications, and insertions. Mutation of the KIT juxtamembrane domain is the most common mutation site
independent of the site of the primary tumor. Conversely, KIT extracellular domain Ala502-Tyr503 duplication appears to be relatively specific for intestinal
GISTs. Mutations in PDGFRA have been identified in
juxtamembrane and tyrosine kinase domains, mostly
in gastric GISTs and the epithelioid histologic variants.

Genetic Aberrations of Extragastrointestinal
Stromal Tumors
Extragastrointestinal stromal tumor (EGIST) is a
unique tumor that occurs outside the gastrointestinal
tract. EGISTs have a histologic appearance similar to
that of GISTs. Yamamoto et al examined the clinicopathologic features, prognostic factors, and KIT and
PDGFRA mutations in 39 cases of EGIST. The KIT
mutations were found in exon 11 in 12 of 29 cases
and in exon 9 in 2 of 29 cases. The PDGFRA gene
mutation was found at exon 12 and 18 in 1 case
each. The pattern of KIT and PDGFRA mutation in
EGISTs was essentially similar to that in GISTs, albeit
at a lower frequency.36
Genetic Aberrations of GISTs in Other Tumors
GIST has an apparent association with other cancers,
such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is
caused by mutations of the NF1 gene, and patients
with such mutations have an elevated risk of developing a GIST. In study of Kinoshita et al, none of the
29 GISTs derived from NF1 patients had detectable
KIT mutations, and none of the 10 GISTs derived
from patients without NF1 had detectable NF1 mutations.37 In what to our knowledge is the largest case
analysis performed to date, by Miettinen et al, it was
demonstrated that, in 45 patients who had NF1 and
GISTs, none of the 16 tumors from 15 patients had a
KIT mutation in exon 9, 11, 13, or 17 or a PDGFRA
mutation in exon 12 or 18 as is typical in sporadic
GISTs. These data clearly indicate that GISTs in NF1
patients have a different pathogenesis than sporadic
GISTs.38 Data from others confirm this, and they suggest that the molecular event underlying GIST development in this patient group may be a somatic
inactivation, such as LOH of the wild-type NF1 allele.

Genetic Aberrations of GISTs/Yang et al

This leads to inactivation of neurofibromin and subsequent activation of the MAP-kinase pathway. Interestingly, the JAK-signal transducer activator of
transcription 3 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT
pathways were less activated in NF1-related GISTs
than in sporadic GISTs.39,40 Recently, Pasini et al
reported a patient who had a unique combination of
multiple fibrous polyps and lipomas of the small
intestine and several gastric GISTs. The patient was
found to carry a germline PDGFRA mutation
(V561D) in the heterozygous state, which to our
knowledge has been seen only rarely before and only
in sporadic GISTs. CGH identified losses of chromosomal regions 1p33-36, 9q12-24, 11q13, and 16q.41
Carney triad is an extremely rare syndrome with 3
types of tumors present, including GISTs, extra-adrenal paragangliomas, and pulmonary chondromas.
Incomplete Carney triad cases have 2 of the 3 tumor
types present, usually the GISTs and chondromas.
Agaimy et al evaluated GISTs from 3 women with
incomplete Carney triad for KIT and PDGFRA mutations and found all cases had wild-type KIT exons 9,
11, 13, and 17 and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18. CGH
revealed 14 aberrations, including 11 gains (X, 1q, 5p,
8q, 9p, 12p, 13q, 18p, and 19q), 2 amplifications (1q,
19p), and 1 loss (13q). Carney triad-related GISTs not
only lack conventional KIT and PDGFRA mutations,
but they also lack the nonrandom loss of 14q and
22q characteristic of their sporadic counterparts, suggesting an origin through a distinct pathogenetic
pathway.42

Prognostic Value of Genetic Aberrations
Singer et al evaluated the prognostic relevance of KIT
mutations in a series of GISTs and determined that
particular KIT mutation types are associated with
prognosis. The independent predictors of diseasefree survival were the presence of deletion/insertion
exon 11 mutations, mixed histologic patterns, and
male sex. These results suggest that KIT mutation
and activation are important in GIST pathogenesis
and also may provide important prognostic information.15 In a population-based series involving longterm follow-up of 177 GIST patients not treated with
imatinib, investigators found that KIT exon 11 deletions adversely affected outcome. It was suggested
that KIT exon 11 deletion is an independent adverse
prognostic factor in patients with GISTs.43 Cho et al
and others also reported that KIT mutation-positive
GISTs showed more frequent liver metastases and
higher mortality than KIT mutation-negative GISTs,
which indicates that KIT mutations, especially deletions in exon 11, are markers of poor prognosis for
preimatinib gastric GISTs.44 Miettinen et al examined

1537

906 patients with GISTs of the jejunum and ileum
and found similar results.45 Deletions affecting codons 557 to 558 are also relevant for the prognosis in
GIST patients. This genetic alteration could be considered in prognostic stratification of GIST patients
for randomized trials exploring imatinib mesylate in
the adjuvant setting.46
Kikuchi et al suggested that LOH of the KIT gene
is an important event that leads to imatinib resistance and metastatic progression of GISTs, which
played an important role in aggressive tumor behavior and perhaps the process of liver metastasis.47,48
What is more, Lasota et al documented shifting from
heterozygosity to homozygosity of KIT exon 11 mutations during tumor progression in metastases, but
not in primary GISTs.49 At the same time, a small
subset of GISTs with otherwise typical clinicopathologic and cytogenetic features did not express detectable KIT protein. When compared with KIT-positive
GISTs, these KIT-negative GISTs are more likely to
have epithelioid cell morphology, express PDGFRA
oncogenic mutations, and arise in the omentum/
peritoneal surface. Notably, some KIT-negative GIST
contained imatinib-sensitive KIT or PDGFRA mutations; therefore, patients with KIT-negative GISTs
should not, a priori, be denied imatinib therapy.50
Haller et al examined the prognostic relevance of
the CDKN2A tumor suppressor pathway in GIST and
found that low mRNA expression of the CDKN2A
transcripts p16 and p14 but high mRNA expression
of CDK4, RB1, MDM2, TP53, and E2F1 was associated
with aggressive clinical behavior and unfavorable
prognosis. Univariate analysis revealed high expression of E2F1 to be associated with mitotic count,
proliferation rate, KIT mutation, and aggressive clinical behavior. The findings implicate differential regulation schemes of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor
pathway converging to up-regulation of E2F1 as a
critical link to increased cell proliferation and
adverse prognosis in GISTs.51 Not only do the molecular genetic aberrations correlate with prognosis, but
cytogenetic aberrations also have prognostic value in
preimatinib GIST patients (Table 4).26,52
However, findings regarding the prognostic value
of mutations of KIT and PDGFRA genes present different opinions. In 1 study of 134 Taiwanese GIST
patients, KIT/PDGFRA mutations, 99% in KIT and 1%
in PDGFRA, regardless of the location (exon 9 vs 11)
and type (missense, insertion, or deletion, including
deletion specifically involving codons 557 and 558),
were not found to be significantly associated with a
poor progression-free survival rate. Comparing overall survival in imatinib-treated patients, there was no
significant difference between patients with exon 11

mutation and those with exon 9 mutations.53 This
study raises the question of the prognostic significance of racial differences, which requires further
investigation.

Genetic Alterations and Targeted Therapy
Because most GISTs have an activating mutation of
KIT or PDGFRA tyrosine-kinase receptors, imatinib, a
selective inhibitor of ABL, KIT, and PDGFR tyrosine
kinases, provides a clinical benefit in most patients
with advanced GISTs.54,55 The proteins inhibited by
imatinib and other inhibitors of specific tyrosine kinases are shown in Table 5. Imatinib treatment
markedly inhibited KIT, MAP, and Akt phosphorylation in all transfectants, leading to reduced glucose
uptake via decreased levels of plasma membranebound Glut4 and induction of apoptosis and/or
growth arrest.56 Long-term results from a randomized phase 2 trial by Blanke et al demonstrated
that nearly 50% of patients with advanced GISTs who
were treated with imatinib survived for >5 years,
regardless of whether a 400-mg/day or 600-mg/day
starting dose was used.57 Chen et al found the effect
of imatinib on KIT(820Tyr) was weaker than that on
KIT(del559-560) or KIT(642Glu), indicating various
biologic effects of imatinib on GISTs that have different KIT and PDGFRA mutational settings.58 In the
recently published randomized European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer phase III
trial study, tumors with mutation in KIT exon 11
showed response rates of up to 80%, whereas <50%
of tumors with mutation in KIT exon 9 responded.59
The presence of exon 9-activating mutations in KIT

was the strongest adverse prognostic factor for
response to imatinib, increasing the relative risk of
progression by 171% and the relative risk of death by
190% when compared with KIT exon 11 mutants.
Similarly, the relative risk of progression was
increased by 108% and the relative risk of death by
76% in patients without detectable KIT or PDGFRA
mutations. In patients whose tumors expressed an
exon 9 KIT oncoprotein, treatment with the highdose regimen (800 mg/d) resulted in a significantly
superior progression-free survival, with a reduction
of the relative risk of 61%. GISTs without detectable
KIT mutation in either of these exons often are resistant to imatinib.59 From these data, it is apparent that
therapeutic insight can be gained by genotyping of
KIT and PDGFRA before imatinib therapy.
As more experience with imatinib has accumulated, primary and secondary resistance to this agent
is becoming a major clinical challenge. As many as
40% of patients with GISTs develop secondary resistance to imatinib, which often is because of secondary KIT mutations occurring in addition to the
primary mutation.56 Chen et al reported, for what to
our knowledge is the first time, the presence, after
imatinib treatment, of an additional specific and
novel KIT mutation in imatinib-resistant GIST. They
studied 12 GIST patients with initial near-complete
response to imatinib. Seven harbored mutations in
KIT exon 11, and 5 harbored mutations in exon 9.
Within 31 months, 6 rapidly progressive, imatinib-resistant peritoneal implants developed in 5 of these
patients. All 6 imatinib-resistant implants demonstrated an identical novel KIT missense mutation,

1982T ? C, which resulted in V654A in KIT tyrosine
kinase domain 1. This novel mutation was not present in preimatinib or postimatinib residual quiescent
GISTs, and was strongly correlated with imatinib resistance. Allele-specific sequencing data indicated
that this new mutation occurred in the allele that
harbored the original activating mutation of KIT, suggesting that resistance emerged under the selective
pressure of imatinib.60 Tamborini et al also reported
a novel point mutation in KIT, in exon 14, which
resulted in T670I substitution. Functional analyses
showed that KIT T670I is insensitive to imatinib, and
that introduction of this mutation into a receptor
responding to imatinib subverted its sensitivity to the
drug.61 Debiec-Rychter et al performed a cytogenetic
analysis and screened for mutations of the KIT and
PDGFRA kinase domains in 26 resistant GISTs. Six
distinct secondary KIT mutations were detected in 12
progressive tumors; of these, V654A and T670I were
frequent. One progressive tumor was found to have
an acquired PDGFRA D842V mutation. GIST cells
carrying KIT-del557-558/T670I or KIT-insAY502-503/
V654A mutations were resistant to imatinib; PKC412
significantly inhibited autophosphorylation of these
mutants. Resistance to imatinib and sensitivity to
PKC412 of KIT T670I and PDGFRA D842V mutants
was confirmed using Ba/F3 cells.62

Multiple studies indicate several point mutations
involving secondary mutation in the kinase domain
of KIT, including T670I, T823A, V654A, and other
sites of exons 13, 14, 17, and 18, conferring imatinib
resistance in GISTs. Furthermore, secondary mutations T670I and V654A confer imatinib-acquired resistance, and the former is more resistant to imatinib
than the latter.63-69 Heinrich et al found that imatinib-resistant tumors had levels of activated KIT that
were similar to or greater than those typically found
in untreated GISTs. Secondary kinase mutations were
rare in GISTs with primary resistance but frequent in
GISTs with secondary resistance. Evidence for clonal
evolution and/or polyclonal secondary kinase mutations was noted in 3 of 16 patients. Secondary kinase
mutations were nonrandomly distributed and were
significantly more associated with decreased imatinib
sensitivity than typical KIT exon 11 mutations. By
using RNA interference technology, these investigators demonstrated that imatinib-resistant GIST cells
remain dependent on KIT kinase activity for activation of critical downstream signaling pathways. From
these data, it is clear that different molecular
mechanisms are usually responsible for primary and
secondary imatinib resistance in GISTs.70
In the study of Desai et al, a unique ‘‘resistant
clonal nodule’’ pattern (defined as a new enhancing

nodular focus enclosed within a pre-existing tumor
mass) was observed in 23 of 48 patients and was
believed to represent the emergence of clones resistant to imatinib. This investigation revealed new activating kinase mutations in 80% (8 of 10) of the
examined tumors. The resistant clonal nodule is a
unique pattern of disease progression observed in
patients with GISTs after an initial response to imatinib and reflects emergence of imatinib-resistant
clones. A new enhancing nodule growing within a
pre-existing tumor mass should be classified as a
new lesion and be regarded as at least partial progression of GIST.71
All of these data highlight the potential mechanisms of resistance to imatinib and would be useful in
clinical treatment, but to our knowledge the precise
molecular mechanisms of this drug resistance are
not well understood. Mahadevan et al found that the
imatinib-resistant GIST cell line (GIST-R) developed
from the imatinib-sensitive (GIST-S) GIST882 cell
line acquires imatinib resistance by overexpressing
the oncogenic RTK AXL in a ‘‘kinase switch.’’ Realtime polymerase chain reaction and Western blot
analysis of the GIST-S and GIST-R cells confirmed
the switch from KIT to AXL. This switch is associated
with a morphologic change from spindle to epithelioid histologic pattern. Molecular modeling of the
kinase domain of mutant KIT exon 13 (V654A) and
AXL showed no binding to imatinib.72 From the present reports regarding drug resistance of GIST, Tarn
et al considered that the phenomenon of resistance
to treatment, which arises primarily through selection for secondary mutations in GISTs, could also
involve amplification or activation of other RTKs.73
Alteration of drug sensitivity can be fought by specific RTK inhibitors, and RTK activation involves a
transduction pathway whose components (mitogenactivated protein kinase, AKT, phosphoinositide 3kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and RAS)
are possible targets of new molecular treatment. A
new paradigm of classification integrating the classic
pathologic criteria with the molecular changes may
eventually facilitate more personalized prognosis and
treatment.74 Furthermore, there are patients with primary GISTs who lack mutations in either KIT or
PDGFRA, or express ‘‘imatinib-resistant’’ mutations
in these genes. These tumors typically do not
respond well to imatinib therapy. The use of
‘‘second-generation’’ KIT and PDGFRA inhibitors is
still in its early stages, but is promising, because
some of these drugs use alternative molecular
mechanisms that may be able to counter primary or
secondary resistance to imatinib. The use of rational
combinations of inhibitors to prevent or slow the

development of resistance may be useful. This may
not be the complete solution, and identifying additional genetic factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of GISTs, independent of KIT and PDGFRA,
may be important in developing additional anti-GIST
therapies. New drugs that can serve as alternative
therapies in imatinib-resistant GISTs or that can be
used in combination with imatinib are needed.

Conclusions
GIST is the most common malignant mesenchymal
tumor in the gastrointestinal tract and is typically
characterized by specific KIT or PDGFRA gene mutations. In addition to KIT and/or PDGFRA mutation,
other genetic events are likely involved in tumorigenesis. Described cytogenetic aberrations include loss
of 1p, 13q, 14q, 15q, and 22q; chromosomal numerical and imbalance aberrations; and nuclear/mitochondrial microsatellite instability. Other molecular
genetic aberrations include LOH of p16(INK4A) or
p14(ARF); methylation of p15(INK4B); homozygous
loss of Hox11L1; amplification of C-MYC, MDM2,
EGFR1, and CCND1; and others. GISTs in patients
with NF1 seem to lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations
and appear to have a different molecular mechanism. Molecular genetic aberrations of the KIT or
PDGFRA gene are correlated not only with the specific cell morphology, metastasis, and prognosis, but
also with the efficacy of targeted therapy, especially
imatinib. Because the biologic effects of imatinib
vary with the site of KIT and PDGFRA mutation in
GISTs, genotyping can be helpful in guiding aspects
of therapy with imatinib or other related inhibitors.
The mechanisms of acquired resistance to imatinib
in GISTs include secondary mutation of KIT and
PDGFR and possibly amplification or activation of
other RTKs. Primary or secondary mutations in the
kinase domain of KIT involving imatinib resistance
include V654A, T670I, T823A, del557-558,74 insAY502593, and other sites of exon 9 (partial resistance), 13
and 17 in the kinase domain of KIT, and D842V in
PDGFRA. Alteration of imatinib sensitivity can be
fought by specific RTK inhibitors, and a new paradigm of classification integrating the classic pathologic criteria with the molecular changes will
facilitate personalized prognosis and treatment.17,73
