Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC)–based immunotherapy can trigger effective immune responses against cancer in human
patients. Although accompanied by little toxicity, further improvements are needed to optimize immune responses for fully satisfactory clinical outcomes. IFNγ, a potent inducer of T helper type 1 immune responses, is
considered an important tool to realize improvements. In this study, we sought to clarify the effect of IFNγ on
the maturation and activation of DCs and the clinical outcome of DC-based cancer therapy in dogs. In vitro
experiments indicated that IFNγ significantly enhanced the expression of immune stimulatory molecules and
interleukin-12 by DCs derived from canine monocytes. IFNγ also significantly strengthened DC-mediated
growth suppression against tumor cell lines. DC inoculation with concomitant delivery of IFNγ into primary
or recurrent tumors elicited significant clinical responses, including four complete responses and two partial
responses against malignant tumors, also eliciting partial responses against benign but actively growing
tumors. Together, our results indicate that combining IFNγ and DCs could induce strong immune responses
against tumors, significantly improving clinical outcomes. The present study of dogs bearing common types
of cancer in humans offers a unique line of support for the development of human cancer therapies. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Because of their high efficiency in initiating and activating
immune responses, dendritic cells (DC) have shed light on
their therapeutic potential as adjuvants for tumor immunity.
In the last decade, there has been an increase in clinical trials
against malignant tumors using DCs loading tumor antigens
(1–6) or DCs fused with tumor cells (7), which were induced
in vitro from peripheral monocytes or bone marrow precursors by defined cytokines, including granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-4, and
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). These DC treatments have
been performed against a variety of malignant tumors in-

cluding melanoma (1), myeloma (6), and carcinoma of thyroid (2), hepatic (3) pancreatic (5), or renal (4, 7) cells.
Regardless of the origin of the tumor, the DC treatments induced tumor-specific immune responses and showed almost
no toxicity in patients. Nevertheless, clinical responses to the
treatment were not so successful; tumor growth was observed in more than half of the patients treated (1–7). It
seems that more potent immune stimulation against tumor
is necessary to elicit adequate clinical responses. Inefficiency in immune stimulation may be due to the degradation of
DCs after their inoculation into the body of patients in
which the specified cytokines abundantly supplied in vitro
were deficient (8, 9). In addition, some tumors, such as melanoma (10) and transmissible venereal tumor (11), inhibit
DC function. It is therefore vital to obtain a clinical response that prevents DC degradation, and is important to
promote the maturation and activation of DCs at the site
of DC inoculation.
IFNγ is a cytokine that is known to activate T helper
type 1 and natural killer cells, and is produced in response
to tumors. IFNγ also directly acts on DCs to promote maturation (12, 13), prevent a reduction in activity (14, 15), and
enhance suppression activity against tumor growth (16).
Thus, immunity against tumors in vivo may be efficiently
augmented to improve the clinical response, provided that
IFNγ is maintained in the environment where DCs are
involved.
Dogs suffer from common human tumor types, including
carcinoma of the mammary gland, lymphoma, osteosarcoma,
and soft tissue sarcoma (17). They have also been extensively

studied for the diagnosis, therapy, and monitoring of such
tumors (18). Success in DC therapy against canine tumors
consequently provides convincing information that advances
DC therapy in humans. In the present study, we clarified the
effect of IFNγ on the maturation and activation of DCs
derived from dog peripheral monocytes in an in vitro study,
then examined the clinical response of canine tumors to
therapy using DCs and IFNγ. These results point toward a
promising method for cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Animals
For the in vitro study, laboratory-bred female beagles, 4 to
8 years of age, were housed and used in accordance with NIH
guidelines and with the regulations of the local Institutional
Animal Care and Use. The study protocol was also approved
by the animal experiment committee of the Graduate School
of Life and Environmental Sciences of Osaka Prefecture University. Each separate experiment was carried out using different animals. For the clinical study, seven dogs (5–17 years
old) with malignant or benign tumors, which had been admitted to Shin-Kanaoka Animal Hospital (Sakai City, Japan),
were treated. Tumors were diagnosed by histologic or cytologic examination on specimens obtained by biopsy or by
surgical removal. Written consent was obtained from all
dog owners prior to the start of the study.
Generation and treatment of DCs
DCs were induced from peripheral blood monocytes isolated using anti-human CD14 monoclonal antibodies (mAb;
culture supernatants of clone 3C10; American Type Culture
Collection) and goat anti-mouse IgG microbeads (Miltenyi
Biotec GmbH) as described previously (19). After the isolation procedure, 98% of the resultant cells showed DC14
positivities. To induce differentiation into DCs, isolated monocytes were suspended at a concentration of 1 × 106/mL in a
culture medium consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Bio-Solutions Japan, Inc.), and were
incubated with canine GM-CSF (40 ng/mL) and canine IL-4
(33 ng/mL) at 37°C for 7 days.
In the in vitro study, the DCs generated were further incubated in the culture medium at various concentrations of recombinant canine IFNγ (kindly provided by Toray, Tokyo,
Japan) for 5 days, to examine the morphology, surface antigen implying maturation, and the production of IL-12. They
were also incubated for 48 hours to examine tumor growth
inhibition, and the expression of TNFα and TNF-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).
In the clinical study, the DCs were washed and further incubated with 50 μg/mL of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH;
Sigma) in RPMI 1640 for 3 hours. After incubation, the cells
were harvested, washed, and inoculated into the patient dog
from which the cells originated.
Examination of morphology and surface antigens
For morphologic examination, samples were prepared by
cytocentrifuge using Cytospin 4 (Thermo Shandon), and were

stained with a quick staining kit, Hemacolor (Merck). For
surface antigen examination, cells were incubated with the
following mAbs against surface markers indicating DC maturation (20, 21): FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD1a
mAb (clone NA1/34-HLK; Serotec), rat anti-canine MHC class
II mAb (clone YKIX.334.2; Serotec), PE-Cy5–conjugated
mouse anti-human CD14 mAb (clone TÜK4; Serotec), biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD80 mAb (clone 1G10; Becton Dickinson Biosciences), and mouse anti-human CD86
mAb (clone FUN-1; Becton Dickinson Biosciences). The
cross-reactivity of these antibodies to dog antigens was confirmed in previous reports (21, 22) or by the manufacturers.
The incubation procedure with mAbs took place at 4°C for
30 minutes using 1 × 105 cells suspended in 50 μL of PBS
and 2% fetal bovine serum. Incubation with biotin antiCD80 mAb was followed by incubation with Streptavidin
PE-Cy5 (Becton Dickinson Biosciences). Before use in incubation, anti-CD86 mAb was labeled by PE-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probe). Excess PE-goat antimouse IgG was neutralized by excess purified mouse IgG
(Sigma). The mean expression intensity of the cell surface
molecules was quantified by the mean fluorescence intensity
using appropriate software (CellQuest, Becton Dickinson
Biosciences) after the assay.
Assay for IL-12 production and TNFα and
TRAIL expression
Production of IL-12 (p70) from DCs (1 × 105) was detected
by measuring IL-12 present in the culture supernatant, using
a kit of ELISA for canine IL-12p40 (DuoSet ELISA Development System; R&D Systems). The mRNA expression of canine
TNFα and TRAIL was examined by RT-PCR using the following primers: TNFα sense, 5′-TCAGCCTCTTCTCCTTCCTC-3′;
TNFα antisense, 5′-ACATGAGCTACTGGCTTGTC-3′; TRAIL
sense, 5′-TGAAGAGAGTATGAACAACC-3′; TRAIL antisense,
5′-GAATTGGAAACATGCTTCTC-3′. As a control, a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate hydrogenase
cDNA, was examined.
Assay of tumor growth inhibition
A canine thyroid adenocarcinoma line CTAC and a canine osteosarcoma line D17 were maintained as previously
described (23, 24). Inhibition of tumor growth by DCs was
examined as described by Chapoval and colleagues (16). In
summary, CTAC or D17 cells (104) were incubated with
DCs (5 × 104) in 200 μL of culture medium containing various concentrations of canine IFNγ at 37°C for 48 hours in
a 96-well plate. Proliferation of tumor cells was evaluated
by the radioactivity of [3H]thymidine (92.5 kBq/mL; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) incorporated into DNA
during an additional 6-hour incubation. As a control, tumor cells were incubated with the same concentration of
IFNγ but without DCs. Results are quoted as the percentage of inhibition, calculated according to the formula:
% inhibition = (1 − test cpm/control cpm) × 100%. In
some experiments, cell-to-cell contact between DCs and
tumor cells was interrupted by a 1.0-μm-pore culture insert
(Becton Dickinson). In these experiments, the culture inserts

were placed in the wells of a 24-well plate. Tumor cells
(105) in the 1 mL medium were added to the well, and
DCs (5 × 105) in the 1 mL medium containing 0 or 103
units/mL of IFNγ were added to the culture insert. After
48 hours, the inserts were removed, and the proliferation
of tumor cells was evaluated as described above. Apoptosis
was also evaluated by incubating tumor cells with Hoechst
33342 (2 μg/mL; EMD Chemicals) for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
Clinical treatment of patient dogs
Complete treatment comprised a single injection of DCs
combined with three injections of IFNγ (Interdog: Toray)
at weekly intervals. Eight cycles of the complete treatment
were performed for each patient. In each cycle, autologous
DCs were injected directly into tumor tissue along with canine IFNγ (104 units/kg), followed by the injection of IFNγ
(104 units/kg) into the same site on the second and fifth days
after DC injection (summarized in Supplemental Fig. S1). After eight cycles of the complete treatment, treatment was
performed without the subsequent injection of IFNγ on the
second and fifth days. One patient dog received DCs without
IFNγ at weekly intervals for 42 days before beginning the DC
plus IFNγ treatment (case no. 1 in Table 1). Another dog
received IFNγ by itself every other day for 10 days before beginning the DC plus IFNγ treatment (case no. 2 in Table 1).
Preparation of tumor antigen
Lysates from tumor tissues were used as the source of tumor antigen and were prepared by repeating a freeze–thaw
cycle as described by Geiger and colleagues (25). The protein

concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/mL and stored at −80°C
before use.
Assessment of clinical and immunologic responses
Clinical responses to treatment were evaluated according
to WHO criteria. Complete response was defined as the complete disappearance of all clinically detectable disease; partial
response was defined as a ≥50% decrease in the sum of the
two longest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions without the appearance of new lesions; stable disease
was defined as a <25% increase or a <50% decrease in tumor
size; and progressive disease was defined as a ≥25% increase
in existing lesions, or the appearance of new metastasis. Survival time was calculated from the date of the first treatment
until the time of death.
To examine whether the inoculated DCs exert their role
of priming antigens, the responses of blood mononuclear
cells to KLH and tumor lysate were evaluated as described
by Geiger and colleagues (25), with minor modifications. In
summary, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from animals before treatment, and after the eighth
treatment. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (2.5 ×
105) were incubated with various concentrations of KLH
or lysate in 200 μL of culture medium at 37°C for 5 days.
Proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was
quantified by the radioactivity of the [3H]thymidine incorporated into DNA.
Statistical analysis
Experimental groups were compared using ANOVA
followed by Fisher's protected–least significance–post hoc

Results
Effect of IFNγ on maturation and function of DCs
DCs differentiated from monocytes by 7-day incubation
with GM-CSF and IL-4 were further incubated for 5 days
with various concentrations of IFNγ. The number of resultant cells was not affected by the concentration of IFNγ:
0.8 × 10 5 to 1.2 × 10 5 cells were generated after the
5-day incubation of 3 × 105 DCs. Figure 1A shows the morphology of cultured cells. After 7 days of incubation with
GM-CSF and IL-4, the size of the cultured cells increased
significantly (P > 0.001). The cells were round-shaped with
a round nucleus. Most of the cells had granules in the
cytoplasm, and a veil-like structure or short processus on
the surface. A further 5-day incubation without cytokine
led to cell enlargement (P > 0.05), but the veil-like structure

or processus disappeared, or degraded. In contrast, the
veil-like structure and processus continued to develop after
an additional 5-day incubation with IFNγ. As shown in Fig.
1B, the expression of CD80, an immune stimulatory molecule of DCs, was significantly increased by incubation with
GM-CSF and IL-4. The expression of CD80 was significantly
downregulated by withdrawing cytokines. However, IFNγ
prevented the downregulation and further increased CD80
expression in a dose-dependent manner up to 1,000 units/mL.
Expression of the other immune stimulatory molecule,
CD86, and molecules for antigen presentation, MHC class
II and CD1a, also significantly increased upon incubation
with GM-CSF and IL-4. The increase in expression was enhanced by further incubation with ≥100 units/mL of IFNγ.
In contrast, expression of CD14, which is a monocyte marker, did not increase either by incubation with GM-CSF and
IL-4 or by further incubation with IFNγ (data not shown).
As shown in Fig. 1C, production of IL-12 from cultured cells
was significantly enhanced by further incubation with IFNγ

in a dose-dependent manner. The production of IL-12 from
cells further incubated with GM-CSF and IL-4, instead of
IFNγ, was comparable to that from cells incubated with
10 units/mL of IFNγ (data not shown).
Consistent with the results of Chapoval and colleagues
for human monocyte–derived DCs (16), the canine monocyte–derived DCs successfully inhibited the growth of the
canine tumor cell line, and IFNγ significantly enhanced the
effect (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, 50% of the inhibitory
effect was observed even when direct contact between DCs
and tumor cells was interrupted; the effect was also enhanced by IFNγ. These results suggest that soluble factors
produced by DCs also inhibit tumor growth, as well as
membrane-bound molecules on DCs. Moreover, DCs induced apoptosis of tumor cells, and this ability was significantly enhanced by IFNγ (Fig. 2C and D). As shown in

www.aacrjournals.org

Fig. 3, IFNγ significantly enhanced the expression of TNFα
and TRAIL mRNA by DC. Both TNFα and TRAIL induce
apoptosis, and TRAIL could be membrane-bound or soluble. These findings together suggest that induction of apoptosis by DC is a mechanism underlying the inhibition of
tumor growth.
Clinical outcomes
Characteristics of patient dogs, treatments, and clinical
outcomes are summarized in Table 1. Case no. 1 was a
17-year-old female Shih Tzu. The dog had a golf ball–sized
(37 × 32 × 24 mm) tumor on the left foot pad (Fig. 4A). The
tumor was histologically diagnosed as a sebaceous epithelioma (Fig. 4B). The dog also had multiple soy bean–sized
papillomatous nodules throughout her entire body. The
papillomatous nodules were also diagnosed as sebaceous

epithelioma. Results from the blood cell counts were within
the reference range. In biochemical analyses, a slightly
raised level of blood urea nitrogen (63 mg/dL; reference
range, 4.8–31.4 mg/dL) and creatinine (2.3 mg/dL; reference
range, 0.2–1.6 mg/dL) was detected, suggesting chronic
renal disorder which occurs due to aging in dogs and cats.
To treat the golf ball–sized tumor, DCs (0.6 × 106–3.3 × 106)
were injected into the tumor on six occasions, 7 days apart.
The tumor did not decrease in size, but increased slightly
(38 × 37 × 28 mm; Fig. 4C). The complete treatment as
described in Materials and Methods was then performed.
The number of DCs injected on each occasion was between
0.5 and 3.4 million cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, the tumor had
significantly reduced in size (5 × 9 × 4 mm) by 56 days
(eight cycles) from the beginning of the complete treatment. The papillomatous nodules over the entire body were
not directly treated but also diminished in size or disappeared during the treatment (data not shown). After eight
cycles of the DC plus IFNγ treatment, the second- and fifthday injections of IFNγ were omitted. The tumor nevertheless continued to shrink. Levels of blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine gradually increased and the level of hematocrit
gradually decreased; we therefore commenced treatment
for renal disorder. The levels of blood urea nitrogen and

7098

creatinine, however, reached 143 and 4.3 mg/dL, respectively, and the dog died on day 157.
Case no. 2 had a tumor on the left mandibular site in the
oral cavity (Supplemental Fig. S2A). X-ray examination revealed that the tumor had infiltrated into the mandible.
The tumor in the oral area was surgically removed, but removal of the infiltrated left mandible was not permitted by
the owner. The removed tumor was diagnosed by histologic
analysis as fibrosarcoma (Supplemental Fig. S2B). To inhibit
the growth of residual tumor cells, IFNγ (104 units/kg) was
injected every other day. Tumor growth was not affected by
the IFNγ treatment, however, and it took only 10 days until
the tumor had grown back to half the size of the original
tumor that was removed (65 × 20 × 22 mm; Supplemental
Fig. S2C). The complete treatment was then undertaken beginning on day 17. The number of DCs injected in this case
was 3.1 to 8.2 million cells at each time of injection. After four
cycles of treatment, most of the tumor changed to necrotic
tissue (Supplemental Fig. S2D). Thereafter, the necrotic tissue was carefully removed at every visit for treatment. At
69 days from the start of the treatment, the dog died due
to systemic circular disorder caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Case no. 3 had a tumor on the left breast (over the second nipple), 50 × 40 mm in size, with an ulcerative appearance (Supplemental Fig. S3A). From histologic analysis, the
tumor was diagnosed as carcinoma of the mammary gland
(Supplemental Fig. S3B). No metastasis was observed in the
lymph node (LN) or lung. Because the tumor had directly
extended to the skin, it was considered to be clinical stage
IIIB based on tumor-node-metastasis classification. The
complete treatment was performed from the beginning of
treatment for this tumor. The number of DCs injected
was 0.4 to 1.2 million cells at each time of injection. The
tumor was half its original size after 28 days (Supplemental
Fig. S3C). After 56 days, the tumor disappeared, and only
scars remained (Supplemental Fig. S3D). We found no malignant cells upon examining a biopsy sample. We also
found no metastasis in the LN or lung upon an X-ray and
ultrasound examination. Treatment was performed without
injection of IFNγ on the second and fifth days, and continued to day 140. The dog was alive >800 days later without
clinical signs of tumor relapse or metastasis.
Case nos. 4 and 5 had breast tumors, with sizes 25 × 25
mm and 55 × 35 mm, respectively, according to ultrasound
examination, considered to be stage IIA and IIB. Upon histologic analysis, the tumors were diagnosed as carcinomas. In
neither case did the tumor extend to the skin or breast wall,
and no regional LN metastasis was found. The tumors were
not detectable by day 35 or 56 after the complete treatment
began, based on biopsy and ultrasound examination. These
dogs were alive (after >550 and >650 days) without clinical
signs of tumor relapse or metastasis.
Case no. 6 had a breast tumor that was 110 × 115 × 72 mm
in size. Based on histologic analysis, the tumor was diagnosed as a carcinoma. Metastasis was found in the regional
axillary and inguinal LNs but not in the lung or liver; this was
considered to be stage IIIA disease. The complete treatment

was performed, followed by 19 cycles of the weekly treatment
with DCs plus IFNγ. On each occasion, 1.9 to 4.8 million DCs
were injected. The tumor was vulnerable to necrosis and lysis
during the treatment. After treatment, the tumor was less
than half (50 × 45 × 15 mm) of its original size. However,
the dog exhibited cachexia, lost weight significantly, then
died on day 195. Autopsy found that most of the tumor area
was necrotic tissue at the time of death. No metastasis was
found in the lungs or any other organ, and the tumor did not
extend to the chest wall.
Case no. 7 had several polyps within a 20 × 30 mm area
in the rectum. The tumor was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma based on histologic analysis from a biopsy sample. Metastasis was not found in the LNs. The complete treatment
was performed, followed by 19 cycles of the weekly treatment with DCs plus IFNγ. On day 154, the tumor was
not detectable, and had been replaced by fibrous tissue.
The dog was alive after >450 days without clinical signs
of tumor relapse or metastasis.
As well as the cases described, two dogs with mammary
carcinoma were treated with IFNγ alone, and a dog with a
benign mammary tumor was treated with DCs alone. No
clinical responses were observed.
Effect of treatment on antigen-specific immune
responses in vivo
In the treatment using DCs plus IFNγ, DCs were pulsed
with KLH prior to injection into the tumor. To examine
whether the injected DCs presented KLH and tumor anti-

gens to the immune system, the responses of peripheral
lymphocytes against KLH or tumor lysate before and after
the treatment were compared. Lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of patient dogs did not respond against
KLH or tumor lysate before the treatment. However,
responses against these antigens were significantly
augmented after eight cycles of the complete treatment
(Fig. 5).

Discussion
We first clarified the effect of IFNγ on canine DCs generated from peripheral blood monocytes. An increase in
the expression of immune stimulatory molecules, such as
CD80, CD83, or CD86, and an increase in the production
of IL-12, is considered to constitute evidence of DC maturation in the human (20, 26), mouse (27), and dog (28). In
the present study, we found that DCs induced from dog
monocytes increased the expression of the immune stimulatory molecules and IL-12 by IFNγ. These results are in
agreement with previous studies using myeloid DC precursors in human blood (12) and a cell line of mouse DC precursor (13). Furthermore, as shown by Chapoval and
colleagues in a human study (16), canine monocyte–
derived DCs inhibited the growth of a canine tumor line,
and inhibition was significantly enhanced by IFNγ. In contrast, the results from DCs incubated without cytokine
show that canine DCs significantly reduced immune activity
in an environment lacking stimulation for maturation, as

Figure 5. Antigen-specific immune response of peripheral lymphocytes in
patient dogs. Peripheral lymphocytes were collected from four patient
dogs (case nos. 1, 3, 5, and 6) and were examined for proliferative
response against KLH and tumor lysate. Open and closed squares in the
figure, respectively, indicate responses before and after eight cycles
of treatment with DCs plus IFNγ. Results are shown as mean ± SEM of
four patient dogs described above. A, responses against KLH. a versus b
and b versus c (P < 0.001); c versus d (P < 0.01). B, responses against
tumor lysate. a versus b and b versus c (P < 0.001).

7-day culture were not fully mature and still had phagocytotic activity (19), it was natural to consider that the DCs
injected into the tumor took up antigen from tumor cells
and matured and activated in situ upon stimulation by
IFNγ. The mature DCs may have presented tumor antigens
in situ rather than in LNs, and activated the immune system mainly at the effector phase because IFNγ reportedly
hinders the expression of CCR7 on DCs, which is necessary
for migration into the LNs (31). However, immune response or immune memory against tumor antigens might
have later arisen systemically because the disappearance or
shrinkage in size of tumors was found at areas distant
from the treated tumor, and no metastasis in any other
organs was found. Other cytokines which have been used
together with DCs in clinical treatment are IL-2 and IL-12
(32–35). Like IFNγ, these cytokines also polarize immune
responses to T helper type 1, but their effect on clinical
response and immune responses against tumors was less
clear than that of IFNγ found in the present study. However, treatment with IFNγ but without DCs did not improve the clinical or immunologic response in case no. 2
or in the study of Apte and colleagues (36). Taking all evidence together, we conclude that concomitant inoculation
of IFNγ with DCs strongly induces immune responses
against tumors, ultimately leading to significant improvement in clinical response.
The dog in case no. 1 died due to renal failure during
treatment, although significant clinical response was obtained. The dog was 17 years old, corresponding to 84 years
of age in humans. Because geriatric dogs generally suffer
from renal disorder (37), and no other patients showed renal failure, the renal failure is not believed to be a side effect of IFNγ. A serious problem observed in the DC plus
IFNγ treatment was disseminated intravascular coagulation
or cachexia due to acute necrosis of a large amount of tumor cells. A solution is to surgically remove as much tumor
as possible before the DC plus IFNγ treatment. We are now
seeking to establish a protocol for the treatment of cancer
in internal organs or metastasis using DC plus IFNγ
in dogs.
Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest

reported in humans (8, 9). Overall, these results suggest that
IFNγ rescues the downregulation and promotes maturation
and activation of DCs following differentiation. Because DC
maturation is significant for cancer immunotherapy (29,
30), IFNγ should be useful in DC-based immunotherapy.
As the in vitro data indicate, IFNγ ameliorates the activity of DCs in vivo, and improves clinical responses in DC
treatment against tumors. All dog patients treated showed
clinical responses and significantly increased their immune
responses against immunized KLH and tumor antigens.
Because dogs suffer from common human tumor types
(17), these results suggest that the use of DC plus IFNγ
should be valuable in human cancer therapy. In this study,
we did not load any antigen or epitope peptide on the
DCs to be inoculated. Because DCs generated in the
