BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma exhibits a high incidence of metastases; and, to date, there is no systemic therapy that clearly
improves outcomes. The anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) antibody ipilimumab is a standard of care for
metastatic melanoma; however, the clinical activity of CTLA-4 inhibition in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma is poorly defined.
METHODS: To assess ipilimumab in this setting, the authors performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of 4 hospitals in the
United States and Europe. Clinical characteristics, toxicities, and radiographic disease burden, as determined by central, blinded radiology review, were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with uveal melanoma were identified, including 34 patients who received
3 mg=kg ipilimumab and 5 who received 10 mg=kg ipilimumab. Immune-related response criteria and modified World Health Organization criteria were used to assess the response rate (RR) and the combined response plus stable disease (SD) rate after 12 weeks,
after 23 weeks, and overall (median follow-up, 50.4 weeks [12.6 months]). At week 12, the RR was 2.6%, and the response plus SD
rate was 46.%; at week 23, the RR was 2.6%, and the response plus SD rate was 28.2%. There was 1 complete response and 1 late partial response (at 100 weeks after initial SD) for an immune-related RR of 5.1%. Immune-related adverse events were observed in 28
patients (71.8%) and included 7 (17.9%) grade 3 and 4 events. Immune-related adverse events were more frequent in patients who
received 10 mg=kg ipilimumab than in those who received 3 mg=kg ipilimumab. The median overall survival from the first dose of ipilimumab was 9.6 months (95% confidence interval, 6.3-13.4 months; range, 1.6-41.6 months). Performance status, lactate dehydrogenase level, and an absolute lymphocyte count 1000 cells=lL at week 7 were associated significantly with survival. CONCLUSIONS: In

INTRODUCTION
Uveal melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that represents approximately 3% to 5% of the incidence of cutaneous melanomas.1 Metastasis in uveal melanoma is common, and approximately 50% of patients develop distant cancer within 15
years of their initial diagnosis.2 Uveal melanoma harbors a unique set of genetic alterations compared with cutaneous melanoma. Whereas cutaneous melanoma often harbors activating mutations in BRAF and NRAS, mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein-a (GNA) subunits GNAQ and GNA11 have been reported in approximately 80% of uveal melanomas.3
GNAQ and GNA11 mutations, however, are not correlated with disease-free survival or the development of metastasis.4
The outcome for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma is dismal, with a median survival of approximately 12
months,5 and no systemic therapy has improved survival.6 Drugs commonly used to treat advanced cutaneous melanoma
rarely achieve durable responses in patients with uveal melanoma. Treatment with dacarbazine (DTIC), carmustine

(BCNU), cisplatin, and tamoxifen (the Dartmouth regimen) reportedly produced a response rate of 6%; and a
phase 2 study of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and sorafenib
produced no objective responses.7,8 A retrospective review
of 143 patients who received chemotherapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reported a
single objective response, and other reviews by the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Southwestern Oncology Group described similar findings.9,10
Immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic
uveal melanoma, as a concept, also has been of interest. It
is hypothesized that uveal melanoma may be more immunogenic than other tumors, because it arises in the immunologically privileged site of the eye. Furthermore, uveal
melanoma has high expression of multiple cancer antigens
known to be immunogenic, including glycoprotein 100
(gp100), melanoma associated antigen (MAGE),
melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1) and
tyrosinase related protein 1 (TRP 1).11,12 Clinical experience with immunotherapy in uveal melanoma is limited,
with case reports describing success; however, larger series
have demonstrated equivocal benefit.13,14
Ipilimumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) is
a fully human monoclonal antibody that augments antitumor immunity through blockade of cytotoxic Tlymphocyte-associated antigen 4. Ipilimumab became a
standard of care for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma after an overall survival benefit was demonstrated.15 The activity of ipilimumab in uveal melanoma,
however, has not been well described. A retrospective series
of 13 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma who
received ipilimumab reported 3 patients with stable disease
as the best response,16 and a smaller review described 2 of 5
patients with stable disease at 11 months.17 Only preliminary data have been presented describing patients with
uveal melanoma who received ipilimumab in expandedaccess programs.18 Given the limited therapeutic options
available to patients with uveal melanoma, determining the
efficacy of ipilimumab in uveal melanoma is essential.
We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis
of 39 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma who
received treatment with ipilimumab under an expandedaccess clinical program or using commercial drug. We
report the clinical activity and toxicity observed from 4
academic hospitals in the United States and Europe.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Clinical Characteristics

After obtaining institutional review board approval at
each site, patients with metastatic uveal melanoma who
3688

had received treatment with ipilimumab were identified
from the databases of 4 institutions (Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the United States and
the University Hospital of Lausanne in Switzerland).
Patients who were treated on clinical protocols and with
commercial drug were included. Patients who had
received ipilimumab in combination with other agents or
as reinduction therapy were excluded. Relevant clinical
parameters were collected, including age, sex, ECOG performance status, site(s) of metastatic disease, lines of prior
therapy, and ipilimumab dose received. Laboratory parameters also were collected, including the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level at the time of first ipilimumab
infusion and the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) both
before treatment and approximately 7 weeks after the initiation of therapy. Treatment response and safety data
also were determined. All data were aggregated after
patient deidentification.
Efficacy and Toxicity Assessment

Efficacy outcomes were determined by a radiologist at
each site who was blinded to outcome. Beneficial effects
of ipilimumab were categorized as a complete response
(CR), a partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). The
response plus SD rate was calculated as the percentage of
patients who achieved a CR, a PR, or SD at 12 weeks, 23
weeks, or later after starting ipilimumab treatment.
Immune-related response criteria (irRC) and modified
World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria were
applied to determine each patient’s response.19 Overall
survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method from the first dose of ipilimumab to the date of
death from any cause. Toxicity was assessed through chart
review and was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). Special attention
was given to events of special interest or to immunerelated adverse events (irAE), including rash, colitis, hepatitis, thyroiditis, and hypophysitis.
Univariate comparisons of OS for ipilimumab dose
(10 mg=kg or 3 mg=kg), baseline LDH, ECOG performance status, and ALC were conducted using KaplanMeier estimates; and differences were assessed using the
log-rank test. LDH was divided into categories above or
below the institutional upper limit of normal; ALC was
divided into low ALC (<1000 cells=lL) and normal ALC
(1000 cells=lL). ECOG performance status was classified as fully active versus any restriction (0 vs 1-2). Statistically significant predictors that were identified in the
univariate comparisons were then included in a

multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model.
The Cox regression model was stratified according to the
number of prior therapies (treatment-naive vs other) to
allow for underlying differences in the baseline hazard of
death between these 2 groups. Landmark analyses also
were conducted to compare OS between 7-week ALC levels (low vs normal), because this has been suggested as a
biomarker of ipilimumab efficacy in patients with cutaneous melanoma.20,21 Comparisons of rates of adverse
events were based on the Fisher exact test. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.
RESULTS
Patient and Clinical Characteristics

The clinical characteristics of the 39 patients who were
included in the analysis are listed in Table 1. Patients were
predominately men, the median age was 61 years, and the
median ECOG status was 0. The median number of prior
therapies was 1, and approximately 50% of patients were

treated as part of the Bristol-Myers Squibb expandedaccess clinical protocol (CA184045). Five patients (13%)
received ipilimumab at 10 mg=kg, and the others received
3 mg=kg. The median number of ipilimumab doses was 4
(range, 1-16 doses). Three patients received maintenance
dosing.
Response Analysis

Of the 39 total patients identified, 35 were evaluable for
radiographic assessment of changes in tumor burden after
ipilimumab. The 4 patients who were not assessable either
died before the assessment of change in tumor burden or
were transitioned to palliative care only without subsequent imaging. We assumed that these patients had developed progressive disease, and they were included in all
analyses.
Because tumor assessments were performed both on
and off protocol, the timing of restaging radiography varied somewhat in the study population. With that caveat,
we observed that the first through fourth scans took place
at a median of 10.7 weeks, 16.1 weeks, 23.0 weeks, and
31.3 weeks, respectively. When adjusting for the 12
patients who were restaged before completing ipilimumab
induction (before 10 weeks), the median time to the first
scan was 12.0 weeks. In the 12 patients who underwent
early restaging, the median time to the first scan was 6.2
weeks.
According to irRC, at the time of the first radiographic assessment (approximately week 12), there was 1
immune-related CR (irCR), and 17 patients had
immune-related SD (irSD). The irCR was confirmed on
subsequent scans, and it is noteworthy that 1 patient who
had irSD at weeks 12 and 23 developed a late response,
achieving an immune-related PR (irPR) at approximately
week 100. Before week 23, 6 patients with irSD had progressive disease (PD). One patient with irSD had a confirmatory scan for SD but still was not evaluable at week
23. In addition, 3 patients who had irSD at weeks 12 and
23 later had PD (at weeks 28, 31, and 33). Data on
response and the response plus SD rate are listed in Table
2. In an evaluation of the total study cohort (median
follow-up, 50.4 weeks [12.6 months]), 1 patient had an
irCR, 1 patient had an irPR, and 6 patients had irSD. Seventeen patients had PD at the time of the first scan; however, only 7 of those patients had the required follow-up
scan documenting progression, as required by irRC. The
response rate in total follow-up by irRC was 5.1% (2 of
39 patients).
According to mWHO criteria, at the first radiographic assessment (week 12), 1 patient had a CR, and 15

patients had SD. Seventeen patients had PD at the time of
the first scan. Two patients who were classified with SD
according to irRC were reclassified with PD according to
mWHO criteria given the appearance of new lesions. One
patient was classified initially with SD but had >50% tumor reduction at approximately week 100. In an evaluation of the entire study cohort, at last follow-up, the
overall response rate according to mWHO criteria was
identical to the response rate according to irRC (5.1%; 2
of 39 patients).
The changes in disease burden from baseline by
individual patient are illustrated in Figure 1. The patient

criteria received ipilimumab at 3 mg=kg and achieved a
durable response that is currently ongoing at 62 weeks.
This patient had previously received temozolomide chemotherapy before ipilimumab and experienced grade 1 rash
during treatment. Sites of responding disease in this
patient included liver, soft tissue, and skin metastases.
The patient who achieved SD according to mWHO criteria but had a late irPR according to irRC had previously
received selumetinib and pegylated arginine deiminase.
The response in this patient is ongoing at 140 weeks. This
patient had late toxicity with the development of grade 4
uveitis approximately 2.5 years after the initiation of ipilimumab. Sites of responding disease included brain and
soft tissue metastases. Another noteworthy patient
achieved irSD and had significant tumor shrinkage
through both week 12 and week 23. This patient was had
previously received temozolomide and everolimus, and
the response to ipilimumab is ongoing at 30.4 weeks. Sites

Figure 2. Overall survival is illustrated for the entire cohort.
The median overall survival for the total cohort was 9.6
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3-13.4 months).

LDH level that was within normal limits in all but 3
patients, and, in 2 of those patients, the level was just
slightly out of range. All patients who experienced a
response or had SD at last follow-up had a rise in ALC
from baseline to week 7 (median increase, 600 cells=lL),
except for 1 patient who had a very slight decrease of 300
cells=lL. Half of the patients who obtained a response or
had SD at last follow-up experienced irAEs, including 2
patients with irSD who experienced grade 3 hepatitis and
grade 4 hypophysitis, respectively.
Overall Survival Analysis

After a median follow-up of 12.6 months for survivors,
the median OS for the entire cohort according to the
Kaplan-Meier method was 9.6 months (95% confidence
interval [CI], 6.3-13.4 months) (Fig. 2). In univariate
analysis, neither ipilimumab dose (3 mg=kg vs 10 mg=kg)
nor baseline ALC (low vs normal) was associated significantly with survival (log-rank P 5 .41 and P 5 .10,
respectively). However, ECOG performance status (0 vs
1-2; log-rank P < .0001), lines of prior treatment (0 vs
any; log-rank P 5 .04), and an LDH level within normal
limits (vs elevated LDH; log-rank P 5 .005) were associated with improved survival. The median time between a
diagnosis of metastatic cancer and the first ipilimumab
dose was 12.1 months (range, 0.6-47 months). On the basis of a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model of
OS in which ECOG status and LDH were included as
covariates, an ECOG performance status of 0 indicated
an 87% reduction in the hazard of death compared with a
performance status of 1 or 2 (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI,
0.04-0.44; P 5 .001), and an LDH level within

had survival times <7 weeks and 2 additional patients
who were missing an ALC measurement at week 7.

institutional normal limits indicated an 82% reduction in
the hazard of death (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.050.73; P 5 .02).
A landmark analysis of the ALC at week 7 indicated
a statistically significant difference in OS between patients
with normal and low ALC (Fig. 3). For the 31 patients
who were alive and had ALC measurements at week 7, an
ALC 1000 cells=lL (n 5 22) was associated with a median OS of 13.4 months (95% CI, 9.6 to 1) compared
with a median OS of 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.6-7.0
months) in patients who had an ALC <1000 cells=lL
(n 5 9; log-rank P 5 .004). All patients who had SD, a
PR, or a CR at 23 weeks had an ALC 1000 cells=lL at
week 7. The landmark analysis excluded 6 patients who

Toxicity Analysis

The overall incidence of irAEs was 71.8% (Table 4). Rash
was the most common irAE, affecting 11 patients. Two
patients had diarrhea; and, in both patients, grade 3 colitis
was confirmed by colonoscopy. These patients received
intravenous corticosteroids followed by slow steroid taper
and experienced a rapid resolution of diarrhea. There
were 4 patients reported with thyroiditis (grade 1), 1
patient each with hepatitis and pancreatitis (both grade
3), and 2 patients with hypophysitis (both grade 3). One
patient experienced grade 4 uveitis. Patients with grade 3
or 4 liver and pancreatic toxicities received prompt corticosteroid intervention, and all patients experienced the resolution of symptoms without recurrence after steroid
taper. Some patients required systemic steroids for the
management of irAEs. Two patients with thyroiditis and
both patients with hypophysitis required ongoing hormone replacement after ipilimumab treatment. The
patient with uveitis had significant vision loss impacting
her activities of daily living that has persisted despite
attempted corticosteroid pulse and taper. Although the
numbers were small, the overall incidence of immunerelated toxicities was greater in patients who received ipilimumab 10 mg=kg versus 3 mg=kg. Twenty-three of 34
patients (67.6%) who received 3 mg=kg had irAEs of any
grade compared with 5 of 5 patients (100%) who received
10 mg=kg. However, the comparison was not statistically
significant (Fisher exact test; P 5 .30). The rates of grade
3 and 4 adverse events were higher, although not statistically significant, in the 10-mg=kg group (2 of 5 patients;
40%) compared with the 3-mg=kg group (5 of 34
patients; 14.7%; Fisher exact test; P 5 .21).

Figure 3. This graph illustrates overall survival stratified by
absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) at 7 weeks. For patients
who had an ALC 1000 cells=lL at 7 weeks (solid line), the
median overall survival was 13.4 months (95% confidence
interval, 9.6 months to 1). For patients who had an ALC
<1000 cells=lL at 7 weeks (dashed Line), the median overall
survival was 4.8 months (95% confidence interval, 3.6-7.0
months).

Our retrospective study evaluating the activity of ipilimumab in 39 patients from 4 academic centers in the United
States and Europe is the largest report to date of the activity of ipilimumab in uveal melanoma and provides the
first evidence that ipilimumab can generate mWHO criteria and irRC responses, as well as SD, in patients with
metastatic uveal melanoma. The response rate at last
follow-up in our study was 5.1%. This is similar to the
reported response rates for ipilimumab in patients with
cutaneous melanoma of 4.2% to 10.9% and is higher
than any published therapy specifically for uveal melanoma.15,22,23 The median OS according to Kaplan-Meier
methodology in our study was 9.6 months. Several
patients had ongoing SD at the time of the analysis, and 2
patients had durable responses of >60 weeks. These durable responses underscore the potential utility of immunecheckpoint blockade for the treatment of patients with
metastatic uveal melanoma.
The toxicity of ipilimumab in our series also suggests
that it can be given safely in this patient population. Previous descriptions of grade 3 and 4 toxicities with ipilimumab have reported rates of approximately 10%.18 The
grade 3 and 4 toxicity rate in the current study was higher,
at 17.9%; however, this appears to have been weighted by
those patients who received 10 mg=kg ipilimumab. It is
noteworthy that, with the exception of uveitis in a patient
who had been receiving treatment for >2 years, all grade 3
and 4 irAEs resolved with prompt initiation of high-dose
corticosteroids followed by a slow steroid taper. This is
similar to what has been described in the management of
irAEs among patients with cutaneous melanoma and
underscores the need for vigilance by the treating physician regarding these potential events.
There have been many studies published on various
treatment regimens for metastatic uveal melanoma,
although no clear standard therapy exists. Multiple
reviews of chemotherapy have described response rates in
the single digits.9,10 Biochemotherapy, generally combining cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine with
interleukin-2 and interferon-a, has been advocated in retrospective analyses and has been associated with improved
survival; however, the treatment is associated with significant toxicity, which many patients will be unable to
tolerate.24
More recently, there has been a focus on the emerging molecular biology of uveal melanoma. Preliminary efficacy has been reported for an ongoing randomized phase
2 study of selumetinib versus temozolomide, with
responses observed in 4 of 21 patients (19%) who received

the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor.25 However, in the phase 1 study of the MEK inhibitor trametinib, 8 of 16 patients with uveal melanoma met
criteria for SD, although no responses were reported, and
the median progression-free survival was only 1.8
months.26 In a phase 2 trial of the VEGF-trap aflibercept,
5 of 10 patients with uveal melanoma reportedly were
progression free at 4 months, although no responses were
observed.27
Although several of these molecularly targeted
approaches are promising, durable benefit remains elusive. In our study of ipilimumab, 2 patients (5.1%) had
responses, and 9 patients (23.1%) had SD that lasted
beyond 33 weeks according to irRC and mWHO criteria.
This is similar to what has been described for ipilimumab
in patients with cutaneous melanoma, in which a “tail on
the curve” phenomenon indicates that some patients have
durable clinical benefit over years.28 Even removing the
potential for long-term benefit, however, we observed 3month and 6-month SD rates of 46.1% and 28.2%,
respectively. Prior experiences with DTIC and temozolomide in metastatic uveal melanoma have reported a median time to progression of approximately 1.5 months,
and a progression-free survival of 4 months has been proposed as a significant improvement in SD for patients
with uveal melanoma in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT01143402). Although our data are limited by their retrospective nature, ipilimumab seems to
compare favorably with other published systemic therapies for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.
Our data also suggest that the timing for use of ipilimumab may be important as well. Although the sample
sizes were small, we observed significant associations
between both ECOG performance status and LDH with
survival from the time of ipilimumab treatment. This suggests that the maximum benefit from ipilimumab is likely
to come early in the treatment course for these patients,
before acceleration of cancer growth and decline in functional status. The case for early treatment also is reinforced
by the possibility of late immune induction with antitumor effect. Although we did not observe a patient who
met criteria for progression with subsequent response, we
did observe a patient with SD who eventually developed a
PR. Allowing time for late induction of an immunerelated antitumor effect can be difficult, and this emphasizes the importance of performance status when considering ipilimumab treatment.
It has been suggested that a rise in ALC during ipilimumab treatment may be associated with clinical benefit
and OS.20 We noted that 10 of 11 patients who obtained
3693

Original Article

a response or SD at last follow-up had a rise in ALC and
that an ALC 1000 cells=lL at week 7 significantly stratified patients by median OS (13.4 vs 4.8 months; log-rank
P 5 .004). All patients who had a response or SD at last
follow-up had an ALC 1200 cells=lL at 7 weeks. These
data recommend further study of the ALC at week 7 as a
biomarker of activity for ipilimumab in patients with
uveal melanoma. Given the aggressiveness of this disease,
the potential for an early biomarker of treatment efficacy
would be very useful in the clinical management uveal
melanoma.
Our investigation was limited by several factors.
Toxicities were captured by chart review and, thus, may
have led to a bias toward under-reporting, although this
may be alleviated to some degree because just over half of
the patients were treated on a clinical protocol. In addition, although the databases of 4 melanoma referral centers were used, the study sample size of 39 patients was
relatively small. Therefore, the data may be subject to variability with obfuscation of significant differences that
could exist among different patient subsets. Finally, our
cohort was heterogeneous, the patients were treated both
on and off protocol, and they received various lines of
therapy and different doses of ipilimumab.
Despite these limitations, this investigation represents a robust evaluation of the clinical experience with
ipilimumab in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma
and, to our knowledge, is the first report of responses to
ipilimumab in patients with uveal melanoma. A further
strength of this report is that approximately half of our
patients were treated off protocol in a standard clinical
practice setting, compared with prior investigations in
which patients were restricted to an expanded-access program (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00495066).
Furthermore, by drawing on the experience from 4 academic centers, we may have minimized institutional biases
that could be present within a single center.
It appears that further exploration of the molecular
biology of uveal melanoma will lead to novel, targeted
therapeutic strategies; however, our data suggest that ipilimumab is a treatment that can induce responses or SD for
some patients, and it is already available in standard practice. The toxicity we observed was manageable and was
not significantly different from that observed in the treatment of metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Prospective
studies of ipilimumab in metastatic uveal melanoma are
ongoing to better delineate the exact clinical utility of this
agent. On the basis of our data, we suggest the consideration of ipilimumab as a reasonable therapeutic choice for
this patient population. Patients with uveal melanoma

should be included in future clinical studies that evaluate
novel immunotherapeutic approaches.
