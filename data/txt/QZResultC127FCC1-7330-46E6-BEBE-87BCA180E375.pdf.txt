Summary
Cellular plasticity contributes to the regenerative capacity of plants, invertebrates, teleost fishes,
and amphibians. In vertebrates, differentiated cells are known to revert into replicating
progenitors, but these cells do not persist as stable stem cells. We now present evidence that
differentiated airway epithelial cells can revert into stable and functional stem cells in vivo.
Following the ablation of airway stem cells, we observed a surprising increase in the proliferation
of committed secretory cells. Subsequent lineage tracing demonstrated that the luminal secretory
cells had dedifferentiated into basal stem cells. Dedifferentiated cells were morphologically
indistinguishable from stem cells and they functioned as well as their endogenous counterparts to

repair epithelial injury. Indeed, single secretory cells clonally dedifferentiated into multipotent
stem cells when they were cultured ex vivo without basal stem cells. In contrast, direct contact
with a single basal stem cell was sufficient to prevent secretory cell dedifferentiation. In analogy
to classical descriptions of amphibian nuclear reprogramming, the propensity of committed cells
to dedifferentiate was inversely correlated to their state of maturity. This capacity of committed
cells to dedifferentiate into stem cells may play a more general role in the regeneration of many
tissues and in multiple disease states, notably cancer.

The term dedifferentiation was first coined to describe the process in which cells of the
Urodele retinal pigment epithelium lose their differentiated properties to replace extirpated
lens cells1. Although not formally demonstrated, the term was used to suggest that
differentiated epithelial cells reverted to a prior developmental stage before their subsequent
differentiation into an alternative cell fate. Dedifferentiation has since been explored in
plants, invertebrates, teleost fishes and amphibians2–17. In vertebrates, quiescent
differentiated cells can revert into replicating progenitor cells5–7,11,12,14 to replace lost cells,
but these progenitor cells do not persist as stable stem cells11. Indeed, in murine hair follicle
regeneration, the immediate differentiated progeny of epithelial stem cells are already
resistant to dedifferentiation17. On the other hand, the undifferentiated secretory progenitors
of the intestine that are the immediate progeny of intestinal stem cells are able to
dedifferentiate into stem cells after injury13, mimicking the capacity for dedifferentiation of
the immediate progeny of drosophila germline stem cells3,15,16. Recently, airway epithelial
cells have been shown to be more plastic than previously recognized using stringent lineage
tracing strategies18 and differentiated secretory cells have been shown to give rise to very
rare cells (0.34±0.09%) that express basal cell markers after severe injury, but the properties
of these rare basal-like cells were not studied and their functional capacity was not
assessed19. Here, we specifically sought to determine whether stably committed luminal
cells could dedifferentiate into functional stem cells.

Secretory cells replicate after stem cell ablation

Author Manuscript

Airway basal stem cells have been shown to self-renew and differentiate into multiple
airway epithelial cell types using genetic lineage tracing20,21. Secretory cells are
differentiated luminal cells that have both secretory and detoxifying functions. Secretory
cells can also further differentiate into ciliated cells19. To test whether secretory cells can
dedifferentiate into stem cells, we ablated basal stem cells of the airway epithelium and
simultaneously lineage traced the secretory cells of the same mouse (Extended Data Fig. 1).
To ablate the airway basal stem cells, we generated a CK5-rtTA/tet(O)DTA22,23 (hereafter
referred to as CK5-DTA) mouse, which expresses active subunit of the diphtheria toxin
(DTA) in CK5+ airway basal stem cells following doxycycline administration. CK5
expression is, however, not restricted to the basal stem cells of the airway epithelium and is
expressed in many others epithelial tissues20,22. Therefore, the ablation of CK5-expressing
cells using systemic doxycycline administration through drinking water or by intraperitoneal
injection is lethal in the adult mouse (data not shown). To circumvent this problem, we
designed a method for the inhalational delivery of doxycycline24 as a means to induce DTA
transgene expression exclusively in the airway epithelium. CK5-DTA mice were exposed to

either inhaled PBS (i-PBS) or inhaled doxycycline (i-Dox) for two or three consecutive days
(Fig. 1a, b). Tracheas were isolated 24 hours after the final dose of i-Dox.
Immunofluorescence analysis using the basal stem cell markers p63, CK5, NGFR and
T1alpha (T1α) demonstrated a specific dose dependent ablation of basal cells and a
preservation of normal secretory cell numbers (Fig. 1c–d and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c).
Approximately 80% (n=3) of the airway basal cells were ablated after three doses of inhaled
doxycycline (an 81.0±3.4% decrease in the number of CK5+ cells and a 78.8±2.4% decrease
in the number of p63+ cells) (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Immunofluorescence staining of the
proliferation marker Ki67 in combination with cell type specific markers demonstrated that
residual CK5+ and p63+ basal cells do proliferate, but there are actually fewer numbers of
proliferating basal cells relative to the total population of replicating cells following ablation
(Fig. 1c and e). Surprisingly, there was a 2-fold increase in the numbers of replicating
secretory cells (SCGB1A1+ Ki67+) in i-Dox treated animals (51.29±3.02%) as compared to
i-PBS treated animals (17.7±2.68%) (Fig. 1c and e and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Consistent
with the increased proliferation of differentiated secretory cells, Ki67 staining was
specifically increased in the CK8+ suprabasal layer of the airway epithelium (Extended Data
Fig. 3b). Thus, secretory cells are the predominant cells that replicate after stem cell
ablation. Interestingly, occasional cells expressed both the basal cell marker CK5 and the
secretory cell marker SCGB1A1 in i-Dox treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 3c).

Secretory cells dedifferentiate in vivo

Author Manuscript

To lineage label secretory cells prior to stem cell ablation, we generated quadruple
transgenic mice: Scgb1a1-CreER/LSL-YFP::CK5-rtTA-tet(O)DTA (hereafter referred to as
Scgb1a1-YFP/CK5-DTA mice). Administration of tamoxifen to induce the CreER-mediated
expression of the YFP label in secretory cells was followed by 3 doses of i-Dox to induce
basal cell ablation (Fig. 2a). Lineage labeled YFP+ secretory cells demonstrated increased
rates of proliferation in i-Dox treated animals as compared to i-PBS treated controls
(Extended Data Fig. 3d–e). We identified YFP+ secretory cell-derived cells that were
morphologically indistinguishable from basal stem cells (Fig. 2b). In addition, we found that
a subset of lineage labeled cells expressed a suite of basal cell markers including CK5,
NGFR, p63 and T1α (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3f). Quantification revealed that
7.9±2.08% of basal cells (585 CK5+ YFP+ cells out of 7320 total CK5+ cells in i-Dox
treated animals, n=6 mice) expressed a YFP lineage label demonstrating that
dedifferentiated basal-like cells comprised a substantial fraction of the total stem cell pool.
Dedifferentiated cells did not appear in PBS-treated controls (3 CK5+ YFP+ cells out of
7558 total CK5+ cells counted (0.041±0.028%; n=6 mice). Consistently, when the entire
basal cell population is purified by flow cytometry, the YFP lineage labeled basal-like cells
have lost the secretory cell surface marker SSEA1 (Fig. 2c). Thus, dedifferentiating cells
lose markers of secretory cell differentiation as they acquire markers of stem cells.

Secretory cells dedifferentiate ex vivo
Since our in vivo experiments demonstrated that secretory cells are stimulated to
dedifferentiate by the ablation of basal stem cells, we wondered whether secretory cell
dedifferentiation could be induced ex vivo when secretory cells were cultured in the absence

of basal stem cells. We reasoned that such an assay would provide a platform for further
determining whether the dedifferentiation process is actively suppressed by the presence of
co-cultured basal stem cells. To assess this possibility, we isolated and sorted unlabeled
basal stem cells and YFP+ secretory cells from Scgb1a1-CreER/LSL-YFP mice after
tamoxifen injection (Extended Data Fig. 4). We then performed sphere-forming assays with
these pure YFP labeled secretory cells alone or in combination with pure sorted GSIβ4+
unlabeled basal cells in varying proportions. The formation of three possible types of
spheres is predicted to occur including spheres that are comprised of (1) exclusively YFP+
secretory cell-derived cells, (2) exclusively unlabeled basal cell-derived cells, or (3)
chimeric spheres containing YFP+ secretory cell-derived and unlabeled basal cell-derived
cells in the same sphere (Fig. 3a). Using our mixed cell populations, we identified a seeding
density at which 99.14%±0.18 (n=3) of spheres were either entirely YFP+ or entirely
unlabeled, thus establishing a clonal origin of the spheres. Regardless of the relative ratio of
input secretory and basal stem cells cultured together in a well, the aggregate clonal sphereforming efficiency of each cell type remained constant (Fig. 3b). Immunofluorescence
analysis demonstrated that in many spheres originating from a single YFP+ secretory cell,
some YFP+ cells expressed the basal stem cell markers CK5 and p63, indicating that
secretory cell dedifferentiation occurs ex vivo (even in the presence of nearby purely stem
cell-derived spheres; Fig. 3c). Thus, we established an ex vivo clonal dedifferentiation assay.
Of the total spheres derived clonally from YFP+ secretory cells 88% showed evidence of
dedifferentiation, and in 70.58% of these spheres, greater than 10% of cells expressed the
stem cell marker CK5. Even when the input proportion of basal cells to secretory cells
plated in matrigel was 100:1, no inhibition of dedifferentiation was observed in the spheres
that were clonally derived from secretory cells (data not shown). This suggested the
possibility that basal cells in one sphere do not provide a secreted factor to suppress the
dedifferentiation of secretory cells in another sphere and that direct contact is required to
suppress secretory cell dedifferentiation. Indeed, we observed that in the small fraction
(0.86%±0.09; n=3) of chimerically derived spheres, not a single YFP+ labeled secretory cell
dedifferentiated and went on to express basal cell markers (Fig. 3c). Therefore a single basal
stem cell in direct contact with a secretory cell prevents dedifferentiation. Of note, these
findings cannot entirely exclude the possibility that a secreted stem cell-derived growth
factor can locally suppress secretory cell dedifferentiation. However, they do suggest that an
intimate association of basal cells and secretory cells would be required to generate
sufficient concentrations of a putative secreted dedifferentiation suppressing activity.

To provide further confirmation that secretory cells can dedifferentiate into basal cells ex
vivo, we used mice carrying a doxycycline-inducible basal cell-specific reporter allele (CK5rtTA/tet(O)H2BGFP) and sorted SSEA1+/H2BGFP- secretory cells from their trachea
(Extended Data Fig. 5a and b) and performed sphere forming assay. We verified that no
GFP+ cells were present prior to induction by doxycycline. When doxycycline was
administered during the course of sphere formation, the first appearance of H2BGFP
occurred at day 3 of culture, indicating that the secretory cells had been converted into
basal-like cells. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the resulting H2BGFP+ cells
also expressed p63 and CK5 (Extended Data Fig. 5c, left panels). The same results were
obtained when the sorted SSEA1+/H2BGFP- cells were grown on transwells (Extended

Data Fig. 5c, right panels). Additionally, secretory cells also dedifferentiated into basal-like
cells when we cultured lineage-labeled YFP+ cells of Scgb1a1-CreER/LSL-YFP mice on
transwell membranes or as spheres (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d). These ex vivo
dedifferentiated cells could be serially passaged 5 times in transwell culture or as spheres
and retain their expression of basal stem cell markers and their ability to self-renew
(Extended Data Fig. 6d–e). Similarly, cells that had undergone dedifferentiation in vivo
could also be passaged as stable stem cells (Extended Data Fig. 6f–g). Thus, dedifferentiated
secretory cells can stably self-renew.

Mature secretory cells resist dedifferentiation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine whether all secretory cells have the potential to dedifferentiate or whether only
a subset of secretory cells are endowed with this capacity, we attempted to subset this class
of epithelial cells. To do so we made use of a transgenic mouse strain that expresses EGFP
specifically in secretory cells of the airway epithelium driven by the promoter of the B1
subunit of vacuolar H(1)-ATPase (which we reasoned would be associated with mature
secretory cells and hereafter refer to as B1-EGFP)25,26. Co-immunostaining for SSEA1 and
GFP demonstrated the existence of 3 subpopulations of secretory cells SSEA1+/GFP-,
SSEA1+/GFP+, and SSEA1-/GFP+ (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Of note, all GFP+ cells are
SCGB1A1+ secretory cells and none are CK5+ basal cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a). To
define the cellular hierarchy of these three subsets of cells, we exposed the airway
epithelium of B1-EGFP mice to sulfur dioxide injury. In this injury model, sulfur dioxide
causes the complete sloughing of only the suprabasal differentiated cells. The remaining
basal stem cells are left intact and start replicating within 24 hours to give rise to a mature
epithelium within 14 days. We found that single-positive SSEA1+ cells appeared first on
day 4 and then matured into double-positive SSEA1+/GFP+ on day 6 (Extended Data Fig.
7b) prior to the formation of any fully mature single-positive B1-EGFP+ cells evident in the
fully mature homeostatic epithelium (Extended Data Fig. 7a, lower panel, arrowheads).
Using B1-EGFP mice; we performed sphere-forming assays with each of the three subsets
of secretory cells (Fig. 4a). Intriguingly, all three subsets of cells formed similar large
spheres and all these spheres contained basal-like cells (Fig. 4b–d). Interestingly, the sphere
forming ability of the three populations was inversely proportional to the relative maturity of
the secretory cell subsets (Fig. 4d). Of note, the majority of the cell aggregates produced
from the most mature SSEA1-/GFP+ secretory cell subset occurred as small cell clusters
instead of spheres (Fig. 4c, e). Furthermore, these cell clusters did not contain CK5 and p63
expressing basal stem cells (Fig. 4c).

Dedifferentiated cells stably persist
Author Manuscript

To assess whether dedifferentiated stem cell-like cells have the ability to self renew and
persist in vivo, we generated Scgb1a1-YFP/CK5-DTA mice that possessed lineage-labeled
dedifferentiated basal-like cells as above and these mice were then maintained for 2 months
prior to sacrifice (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Dedifferentiated YFP+CK5+ cells persisted and
continued to represent a sizeable fraction of the stem cell pool (9.15%±0.41; n=3). Indeed,
the relative pool size of dedifferentiated basal-like cells remained stable over the course of 2
months (dedifferentiated basal cells represented 8% of the stem cell pool immediately after

dedifferentiation). Additionally, triple immunostaining for CK5, YFP and Ki67 revealed that
YFP+CK5+ dedifferentiated basal-like cells have the same self-renewal rates as do their
normal YFP-CK5+ basal stem cell counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 8b–c).

Dedifferentiated cells are functional stem cells

Author Manuscript

To assess the functional stem cell capacity of dedifferentiated basal-like cells, we generated
Scgb1a1-YFP/CK5-DTA mice that possessed lineage labeled dedifferentiated basal-like
cells and then exposed these animals to two forms of physiologic airway injury (Fig. 5a and
b). First, a toxin-induced airway injury with inhaled sulfur dioxide was used to efficiently
denude suprabasal cells from the airway epithelium, leaving behind a single layer of basal
cells, some of which were derived from labeled secretory cells that had dedifferentiated
(marked by YFP) (Extended Data Fig. 9a). The epithelium fully regenerated in 14 days as
expected and immunofluorescence analysis for YFP in combination with CK5 (basal cell),
SCGB1A1 (secretory cell), and FoxJ1 (ciliated cell) revealed that YFP+ cells contributed to
all three epithelial cell lineages in the form of scattered YFP+ patches (Fig. 5c, upper
panels). In order to further scrutinize the functional potential of our dedifferentiated basallike cells, we used influenza viral infection as a second physiologic injury model (Extended
Data Fig. 9b)27. We again observed that dedifferentiated basal-like cells participate in
regeneration by giving rise to all three epithelial cell types of the airway (Fig. 5c, lower
panels). Similarly, sorted dedifferentiated cells that were produced either in vivo or ex vivo
could be serially passaged in culture and differentiated into mature airway epithelium (Fig.
5d–f and Extended Data Fig. 10a–c).

Author Manuscript

Furthermore, we asked if individual dedifferentiated basal-like cells are multipotent (ie, able
to give rise to ciliated, secretory, and basal cells) or unipotent (ie, able to give rise to only
one of the cell types). To address this issue, we cultured individual dedifferentiated cells and
then performed an air-liquid interface culture using these clonally derived stem cells.
Immunofluorescence analyses for basal, secretory and ciliated cell markers revealed that
majority of the clonally derived basal-like cells (11 out of 13 clones) are multipotent
(Extended Data Fig. 10d). Intriguingly rare clones give rise to only ciliated (1 out of 13
clones) or secretory cells (1 out of 13 clones). The potential of single dedifferentiated cells
to act as multipotent stem cells suggests that some or most basal stem cells in vivo may
analogously serve as multipotent stem cells. However, the rare lineage restricted clones we
observe may reflect a heterogeneity in the basal cell population in vivo that warrants future
scrutiny.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

Here, we have presented evidence using lineage tracing that fully differentiated cells can
revert into stable and functional basal stem cells. In contrast, in the hair follicle, the
committed progeny of skin stem cells do not revert into stem cells when the skin stem cells
are ablated17. However, in the murine intestinal epithelium, undifferentiated secretory
progenitors that are the immediate Villin-negative progeny of stem cells can revert back to a
stem cell state after injury13. Notably, the capacity of fully differentiated Villin-positive
intestinal secretory cells to revert into stem cells was not assessed. Here we show that fully

committed secretory cells respond to stem cell ablation by proliferating and converting into
functional epithelial stem cells. Our study points to an alternative cellular mechanism
through which tissues can regenerate after stem cell loss. The existence of multiple cellular
reservoirs of regenerative capacity may allow a more effective reparative response when one
or the other cell type is damaged by a toxic or infectious insult.

Author Manuscript

The ability of basal stem cells to prevent the dedifferentiation of secretory cells has many
implications for tissue biology in general since stem cells and their progeny can now be seen
to reciprocally modulate one another to regulate their relative ratios and thereby overall
tissue architecture. In our example, the prevention of secretory cell dedifferentiation occurs
through direct contact with even a single stem cell. This mechanism ensures a precise and
local control of epithelial architecture. More generally, it suggests that the reciprocal
interactions of stem and committed cells may have been “designed” to ensure a robust selforganizing property in diverse tissue types.

Author Manuscript

Furthermore, the ability of differentiated cells to acquire stem cell properties appears to be
inversely proportional to the degree of the maturity of the differentiated cells. This is
analogous to the results seen in amphibian nuclear reprogramming in which nuclei from
more mature cells were less easily reprogrammed than those of their immature
counterparts28,29. The capacity to segregate secretory cells according to their maturity and
associated ability to resist dedifferentiation provides an ideal in vivo experimental model for
dissecting the molecular mechanisms through which cells might lock their identity as they
mature. Finally, our findings have broad implications for cancer biology since our results
point to an underlying physiologic form of cell plasticity that could be co-opted in the
process of tumorogenesis30–34. Indeed, some lung cancers appear to be able to resist
chemotherapy by employing a lineage conversion into a different tumor subtype35.

Cell dissociation and sorting

Author Manuscript

Airway epithelial cells from trachea were dissociated using papain solution. Longitudinal
haves of the trachea were cut into 5 pieces and incubated in Papain dissociation solution and
incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. After incubation, dissociated tissues were passed through a
cell strainer and centrifuged and pelleted at 500×g for 5 mins. Cell pellets were dispersed
and incubated with Ovo-mucoid protease inhibitor (Worthington biochemical Corporation,
cat. # LK003182) to inactivate residual papain activity by incubating on a rocker at 4°C for
20 minutes. Cells were then pelleted and stained with EpCAM-PECy7 (1:50; 25-5791-80,
eBiosciences) or EpCAM-APC (1:50; 17-5791, eBiosciences); GSIβ4 (Griffonia

Sphere forming assays and transwell cultures

Cells were cultured and expanded in complete SGAM medium (Lonza, CC-3118)
containing TGFβ/BMP4/WNT antagonist cocktails and 5 uM Rock inhibitor Y-27632
(Selleckbio, S1049). To initiate air-liquid interface cultures, airway basal stem cells were
dissociated and seeded onto transwell membranes. After confluence, media was removed
from the upper chamber. Mucocilary differentiation was performed with PneumaCult™-ALI
Medium (StemCell, 05001). Differentiation of airway basal stem cells on an air-liquid
interface was followed by directly visualizing beating cilia in real time after 10–14 days. For
clonal culture assays, dedifferentiated basal-like cells (GSIβ4+ YFP+) were sorted and
plated on collagen-coated plates at low cell density to obtain individual colonies. Individual
colonies were isolated using trypsin and directly visualized aspiration on single colonies.
Individual colony-derived cells were maintained and expanded separately and used for airliquid interface culture. Sphere culture was performed as described previously20. Briefly, 50
µl of 1:4 cold matrigel / MTEC-plus medium was layered on an 8-well chamber slide
(Thermo Scientific, Cat.# 177402) and incubated at 37°C for 10 mins to solidify the
matrigel. Sorted cells were mixed in 2% matrigel in MTEC-plus and plated on pre-coated 8well chamber slide at a density of 4000 cells per well. For mixing assays, sorted cells were
seeded at a density of 6000 cells per well. In each experiment, three independent wells were
used for each condition tested. Medium was changed every other day for 9 days. For
transwells cultures, cells were suspended in MTEC-plus medium and plated on transwell
inserts at a cell density of 6000 cells per well. Medium was changed every day for 7 days.
For basal cell reporter assays, cells were treated with 1µg /mL doxycycline either at 24 hours
after plating or just 24 hours before harvest as described in the results section. For serial
passaging of spheres, medium from culture wells was aspirated, washed with PBS, and then
treated with trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) for 2 minutes. Trypsin was inactivated and dissociated
cells were collected and centrifuged at 350xg for 3 minutes at 4°C. Cells were re-seeded at a
1:20 dilution in matrigel for the next round of sphere culture.

Statistical Analysis
The standard error of the mean was calculated from the average of at least 3 independent
tracheal samples unless otherwise mentioned. Data was compared among groups using the
Student’s t-test (unpaired, two-tailed). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered
significant.
