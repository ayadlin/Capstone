Abstract
The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling family contains various protein complexes, which regulate gene
expression during cellular development and inﬂuence DNA damage response in an ATP- and complex-dependent
manner, of which details remain elusive. Recent human genome sequencing of various cancer cells revealed
frequent mutations in SWI/SNF factors, especially ARID1A, a variant subunit in the BRG1-associated factor (BAF)
complex of the SWI/SNF family. We combined live-cell analysis and gene-suppression experiments to show that
suppression of either ARID1A or its paralog ARID1B led to reduced nonhomologous end joining activity of
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), decreased accumulation of KU70/KU80 proteins at DSB, and sensitivity to
ionizing radiation, as well as to cisplatin and UV. Thus, in contrast to transcriptional regulation, both ARID1
proteins are required for cellular resistance to various types of DNA damage, including DSB. The suppression of
other SWI/SNF factors, namely SNF5, BAF60a, BAF60c, BAF155, or BAF170, exhibits a similar phenotype. Of these
factors, ARID1A, ARID1B, SNF5, and BAF60c are necessary for the immediate recruitment of the ATPase subunit
of the SWI/SNF complex to DSB, arguing that both ARID1 proteins facilitate the damage response of the complex.
Finally, we found interdependent protein stability among the SWI/SNF factors, suggesting their direct interaction
within the complex and the reason why multiple factors are frequently lost in parallel in cancer cells. Taken
together, we show that cancer cells lacking in the expression of certain SWI/SNF factors, including ARID1A, are
deﬁcient in DNA repair and potentially vulnerable to DNA damage. Cancer Res; 74(9); 2465–75. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Various types of DNA damage are continually inﬂicted on
cells by environmental agents and metabolic products, leading
to genomic mutation and cell killing, eventually, cancer. DNA
damage is, however, generally repaired by cellular enzymatic
DNA repair systems that maintain genome integrity and
cellular survival. Because of the cell killing effect of DNA
damage, physical or chemical agents producing DNA damage
are often used for cancer therapy. Because DNA repair interferes in the killing effect of DNA damage, DNA repair defect in
cancer cell may be a useful target for cancer therapy.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are one of the most serious
types of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation or chemical agents. In mammalian cells, two pathways conserved in
evolution, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination, contribute to repair of DSBs and sustain
genome integrity. Homologous recombination seeks and uses
genetic information from an undamaged sister chromatid or
homologous chromosome to repair DSBs, whereas NHEJ
directly joins two broken DNA ends without signiﬁcant homologous sequences. NHEJ contributes greatly to cellular survival
soon after DSBs are introduced but not much to genome
integrity, because of its error-prone nature in the repair
process. In NHEJ, the DSB ends are recognized and bound by
the KU70 and KU80 heterodimer (1). The KU complex at a DSB
recruits the DNA-dependent protein kinases, DNA-PKcs, and
stabilizes KU binding to DNA (2), followed by the rejoining of
DSBs with XRCC4-LIGASE4 (3, 4).
Chromatin remodeling facilitates transcriptional regulation
either by posttranslational modiﬁcation of histones or by ATPdependent chromatin remodeling (ATP-CR). Although chromatin remodeling has been characterized in transcriptional
regulation processes, it has recently been established that
chromatin remodeling propagates DNA damage signals within
cells and facilitates access of DNA repair proteins to DNA
damage in chromatin (5–8). Factors of ATP-CR are divided into
four families, SWI/SNF, CHD, ISWI, and INO80, each of which

contains a family-speciﬁc ATPase subunit and various complexes for each regulation purpose. Although several ATP-CR
complexes have been reported to be involved in DNA damage
response and repair especially in yeast (8, 9), factors and
mechanisms contributing to DNA repair remain elusive.
The complexes belonging to the SWI/SNF family in human
cells are further divided into various BRG1-associated factor
(BAF) complexes based on their functions and each complex
consists of around 10 subunits. The chromatin remodeling
complexes bind to a ﬁxed position on DNA, break contact
between histone and DNA, and translocate DNA through the
ATPase activity, and generate a space for DNA binding factors
for transcription (10). The major complex in SWI/SNF is either
BAF or polybromo-associated BRG1-associated factor (PBAF)
complex, which contains an ATPase, either BRM or BRG1, and
a set of highly conserved core subunits such as SNF5, BAF155,
and BAF170 (11) with other variant subunits, which determine
the target of the chromatin remodeling. ARID1A and ARID1B
encode variant subunits in BAF complexes, large nuclear
proteins, BAF250a and BAF250b, respectively, and are responsible for directing the SWI/SNF complex to target promoters
and regulate the transcription of certain genes by altering the
chromatin structure around those genes (12). By way of
caution, ARID1A and ARID1B are used as protein names, not
BAF250a and BAF250b. ARID1A was reported to contribute to
cell-cycle arrest (13), to interact with p53 and BRG1/BRM (14),
and with topoisomerase IIa (15), suggesting that ARID1A is
important as a tumor suppressor. ARID1B shows approximately 60% amino acid sequence identity with ARID1A across their
entire lengths. Mutations in the ARID1B gene cause Cofﬁn–
Siris syndrome, exhibiting developmental defects, and haploinsufﬁciency of ARID1B is a frequent cause of intellectual
disability (16–19). Recently, however, mutations in the ARID1B
gene have been reported in breast cancer (20). Despite their
high similarity in amino acid sequence, the patterns of expression of ARIDA and ARIDB are different during early development in mouse embryos (21) and SWI/SNF complexes containing ARID1A have an antiproliferative function, whereas the
SWI/SNF complex harboring ARID1B showed a pro-proliferative function (22), indicating that ARID1A and ARID1B have
different functions in development and cell-cycle control.
Their functions in relation to DNA damage response and repair
have not yet been studied.
Although yeast SWI/SNF complex has been linked to DSB
repair especially in homologous recombination (8, 9, 23), how
the mammalian SWI/SNF complex is involved in DSB repair
remains elusive. Although BRM and its alternative, BRG1,
contribute to DNA repair of DSBs and UV damage in human
cells (24–26) and involvement of SWI/SNF-interacting BRIT1/
MCPH1 in DNA damage response were reported (27), details
about the involvement of other factors in DNA damage
response and repair are not known. Importantly, the difference
in chromatin remodeling factors between transcription regulation and DNA damage response is not known yet. Recent
cancer genome sequencing efforts revealed that ARID1A is one
of the most frequently mutated genes across all cancer types,
especially in ovarian, breast, gastric, and lung cancer (28, 29).
Furthermore, in primary cancer cells of various tissues, expres-

sion of ARID1A is frequently and signiﬁcantly reduced or
absent (29). Various mutations in SWI/SNF family members
were identiﬁed by genome sequencing of various cancer tissues
(10, 30, 31), and these prompted us to analyze whether and
which SWI/SNF factors are involved in DNA repair, especially
in the response to DSB, using live cell analysis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
All the cell lines used in this article were obtained from
National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan, for
this research purpose. Cell types of the cancer cell lines are shown
in Supplementary Table S1. All the cell lines used in this article
were obtained from National Cancer Center Research Institute,
Tokyo, Japan, for this research purpose. Cell types of the lung
cancer cell lines are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Cell lines
used in this article were not authenticated by cell bank, but
thoroughly tested for the cell line–speciﬁc expression of various
SWI/SNF factors, which was shown in this article. U2OS cells
were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (Wako),
H1299, H1299dA3-1 cells, and lung cancer cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Wako) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Gibco), L-glutamine (Wako), and penicillin-streptomycin (Nacalai Tesque) and cultured at 37 C with 5% CO2. Puromycin (SigmaAldrich), 2 mg/mL ﬁnal, was added to maintain H1299dA3-1 cells.
NHEJ assay
As reported previously (26), the I-SceI expression plasmid,
pCMV-3xNLS-I-SceI (a generous gift of Dr. M. Jasin), was
introduced by transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen) into H1299dA3-1 cells harboring two I-SceI
sites located 1.3 kb apart between the promoter and GFP.
The cells were pretransfected with siRNA for 48 hours
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) into 0.1  105
H1299dA3-1 cells in 24-well plates. Cells were harvested by
trypsinization 48 hours after I-SceI transfection, washed
with PBS, and applied to the CYTOMICS FC500 (Beckman
Coulter). The percentage of GFP-positive cells in 1  104
cells were counted using CXP software (Beckman Coulter).
Laser micro-irradiation
Laser micro-irradiation was performed using the FV500
confocal scanning laser microscopy system (Olympus). Cells
in glass-bottomed dishes were treated with 0.1 mmol/L
8-methoxypsoralen (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 hours before irradiation and micro-irradiated with a 405-nm pulse laser (Olympus). The irradiation dose was ﬁxed at 25 scans after 8-MOP
treatment. Although with this wavelength of light, cross-linking of 8-MOP to DNA hardly occurs, at least 500 DSBs are
produced per 25 scans on the irradiated track determined by
the number of gH2AX, which corresponds to that in the same
cell irradiated with ionizing radiation (IR) of 50 Gy. To examine
the accumulation of DSB repair proteins at laser irradiated
sites, H1299 cells were transfected with GFP-KU70 and GFPKU80, GFP-XRCC4, or GFP-BRM 48 hours before micro-irradiation. At least 10 cells were irradiated in every experiment,
and representative data were shown. Fluorescence images
were obtained at 90 seconds after micro-irradiation.

ARID1A and ARID1B Are Required for DNA Repair

For statistical analysis, protein accumulation at laser-irradiated site was quantitated by intensity of GFP or dsRed
ﬂuorescence using FluoView software (Olympus), and the
mean ﬂuorescence intensity at the irradiated region was
subtracted from that of nonirradiated nuclear region for each
cell. The value of quantitated ﬂuorescence intensity at control
siRNA-treated cell is deﬁned as 100% and relative percentage of
the ﬂuorescent intensity in cells treated with each siRNA is
shown in the graphs. The mean values of three independent
transfection experiments of each siRNA are given. To exhibit
statistical signiﬁcance, at least 10 cells per transfection (n > 10)
are analyzed, and two-sided and homoscedastic Student t test
method was used to determine P-value.
Plasmids
GFP-tagged genes were constructed by introducing fulllength cDNA into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) behind GFP
in frame, resulting in expression vectors pEGFP-ARID1A,
pEGFP-KU70, pEGFP-KU80, and pEGFP-XRCC4. An N-terminally Halo-tagged ARID1B (pHalo-ARID1B) was obtained from
KAZUSA DNA Research Institute.
siRNA
To avoid off-target effects by siRNA and increase the reliability of gene suppression experiment, at least two sets of
siRNA (set 1 and set 2) or 30 -UTR-ARID1A and 30 -UTR-ARID1B
were used for each experiment in this work (see the sequences
of siRNA in Supplementary Table S2). Most of the siRNA of set 1
consist of three different siRNAs targeted for each gene purchased from Qiagen and most of the set 2 consist of four
different siRNAs from Dharmacon. None of the siRNA
sequences used in this article overlaps with each other. U2OS
cell line was used for cellular survival experiments. Because of
cross-reaction found among set 1 siRNAs in U2OS cells, only set
2 siRNA was used for cell survival experiments. This crossreaction was not observed in the H1299 cell line. Absence of offtarget effect in set 2 was conﬁrmed except siBRG1, which was
not used for survival experiment. For siRNA transfections,
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) was used, and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for cotransfection of siRNA
and plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Expression of the target proteins was checked by Western blots
in each of the siRNA treatments.
Western blots and antibodies
Western blots were performed with anti-ARID1A (Abcam),
anti-ARID1B (ABGENT), anti-KU80 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-KU70 (Neomarkers), anti-BRG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-BRM (Abcam), anti-SNF5 (GeneTex), antiBAF53a (Abcam), anti-BAF57 (Abgent), anti-BAF60a (Abgent),
anti-BAF60c (Abgent), anti-BAF155 (Abgent), and anti-BAF170
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibodies were
horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies raised against rabbit
or mouse immunoglobulin G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Survival assays
Three days after transfection with siRNA, about 400 U2OS
cells were plated on 6-cm dishes. Cells were irradiated with IR

or cisplatin was added to medium at indicated dose 6 hours
after plating. Eight to 10 days later, cells were ﬁxed with ethanol
and stained with 0.3% crystal violet, and the numbers of
colonies were counted. Each experiment was performed three
times and standard errors were calculated.

Results and Discussion
Tagged ARID1A and ARID1B accumulate at DNA damage
site and suppression of either expression reduces NHEJ
activity
We ﬁrst wanted to know whether ARID1A and ARID1B
respond to DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 1A, GFP-tagged
ARID1A and Halo-tagged ARID1B accumulated at the site of
DNA damage produced by laser micro-irradiation in the presence of a photosensitizer 8-MOP, which produces efﬁciently
DSBs as determined by the accumulation of KU proteins with
the same irradiation condition in H1299 cells (Fig. 1A, left).
Both ARID fusion proteins did not accumulate at the site
irradiated with lower light dose or without photosensitizer.
Although available antibodies are not good enough to show the
response of endogenous ARID1 proteins, these data suggest
that both GFP- or Halo-tagged ARID1 proteins have responded
to DSB.
We next tested their involvement in DSB repair. First, we
suppressed the expression of either ARID1A and/or ARID1B
using two independent sets of siRNA speciﬁc for each gene
and analyzed their effects on NHEJ activity (see Supplementary
Table S2 for sequences of siRNA used in this article). We
conﬁrmed that both siRNA sets warrant speciﬁc suppression
effects on either ARID1A or ARID1B in H1299 (Fig. 1B, top three
panels) and the suppression of ARID1A or ARID1B expression
did not inﬂuence the expression of NHEJ proteins (Fig. 1B,
bottom). We then determined the NHEJ activity in H1299dA3-1
cells, a derivative cell line of H1299, in which NHEJ activity
was determined by the percentage of GFP-positive cells after
the induction of two DSBs by I-SceI transfection, removal of
TK gene fragment, and successful NHEJ repair leading to the
expression of GFP gene (see Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 26).
Suppression of either ARID1A or ARID1B expression signiﬁcantly reduced the efﬁciency of the repair, but double knockdown of both genes did not further reduce the NHEJ activity
obtained with single siRNA treatment (Fig. 1C). Set 1 siRNAs
for ARID1A or ARID1B more effectively reduced NHEJ activity
than set 2, which may be explained by an off-target effect of
set 1 siRNA for ARID1A and ARID1B. These data indicate that
both ARID1A and ARID1B were required for the NHEJ pathway.
Suppression of ARID1A or ARID1B expression reduces
the accumulation of repair proteins involved in the NHEJ
pathway at DSB
Having found that suppression of ARID1 proteins reduces
NHEJ activity within cells, we wanted to know where ARID1
proteins are needed in NHEJ. We applied laser micro-irradiation and analyzed whether the suppression inﬂuences accumulation of KU70 and KU80 at laser-irradiated sites in H1299
and U2OS cells. Although the coexpressed GFP-KU70 and GFPKU80 accumulate at laser-induced DSBs very effectively, suppression of either ARID1A or ARID1B signiﬁcantly reduced the

accumulation of coexpressed GFP-KU70 and GFP-KU80 in
H1299 cell (Fig. 1D) and in U2OS cell (Supplementary Fig.
S2B), suggesting that both ARID1A and ARID1B are required
for the recruitment of GFP-tagged KU70 and KU80 proteins at
DSBs. In contrast to Fig. 1C, there was no difference in the
suppression effects on KU accumulation between set 1 and set
2 siRNAs. Fig. 1E shows rescue experiments, in which we
expressed the GFP-ARID1A or Halo-ARID1B (indicated with
open triangle in blots) in cells where endogenous ARID1A or
ARID1B expression was suppressed, respectively, using siRNA
targeted at 30 -UTR sequences of either gene. Correspondingly,
the accumulation of dsRed-KU70 (top graph) or GFP-KU70
(bottom graph) at laser-irradiated site was recovered in the
cells expressing both red and green ﬂuorescent proteins.
Although the transfection efﬁciency of Halo-tagged ARID1B
was low as shown in the Western blot analysis (bottom blot
right), those cells expressing Halo-tagged ARID1B were identiﬁed and analyzed under microscope. We obtained the identical data by using U2OS cells instead of H1299 (Supplementary
Fig. S2C).
Accumulation of XRCC4 at DSBs is dependent on the
presence of KU proteins at DSBs (3). In laser micro-irradiation
experiments, accumulation of GFP-tagged XRCC4 at laserirradiated sites also depends on the presence of endogenous
KU protein (Fig. 1F). Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that
accumulation of GFP-XRCC4 at laser-irradiated site reﬂects
the amount of endogenous KU proteins accumulated at
DSBs. Fig. 1G shows that the suppression of either ARID1A
or ARID1B by either set of siRNA signiﬁcantly reduced the
accumulation of GFP-XRCC4 at laser-irradiated sites in H1299
cell, indicating that ARID1A and ARID1B are necessary for the
accumulation of endogenous KU proteins at DSBs. We
obtained identical results using U2OS cell line (Supplementary
Fig. S2D and S2E). Taken together, both ARID1A and ARID1B
are involved in the NHEJ pathway at an early stage of the
process. Because both ARID1 proteins are variant subunits in
the BAF complex, these data indicate that the BAF complex of
the SWI/SNF family is involved in DNA DSB repair. However,
which subunits in the BAF complex are involved in the damage
response process remains elusive.
Determination of SWI/SNF subunits required for NHEJ
Having established the requirement of ARID1A and ARID1B
in NHEJ, we wanted to extend our knowledge to which subunits
in the SWI/SNF complex are required for NHEJ repair of DSBs.
We performed the three experiments used for ARID1 proteins,
namely, NHEJ activity and accumulation of GFP-KU70/GFPKU80 and GFP-XRCC4 at laser-irradiated sites using two sets
of siRNA speciﬁc to nine well-known SWI/SNF subunits, BRM,
BRG1, SNF5, BAF53a, BAF57, BAF60a, BAF60c, BAF155, and
BAF170 in H1299 cells, in which NHEJ assay system was
established and all the tested SWI/SNF factors except BRG1
are well expressed. Therefore, siBRG1 was used as a negative
control in gene suppression experiments. The suppression
effects with set 1 as well as set 2 siRNA were very effective
on every genes tested as shown in the Western blots in Fig. 2A
and B. No inﬂuence on the expression of NHEJ proteins by set 1
and set 2 siRNA treatments was conﬁrmed (Fig. 2C and D,

www.aacrjournals.org

respectively). Fig. 2E and F show the results of three different
experiments obtained by set 1 and set 2 siRNA, respectively,
together with those for ARID1 proteins obtained in Fig. 1.
Results of three different experiments correspond very well
within each suppressed gene by either set of siRNA treatment.
Suppression of BAF53a and BAF57, like the negative control of
BRG1, decreased neither NHEJ activity, nor KU accumulation
of GFP-KU and GFP-XRCC4 after treatment with either set of
siRNA, whereas suppression of other factors signiﬁcantly and
similarly decreased both NHEJ activity and GFP tagged and
endogenous KU accumulation at DSBs. As apparent from the
comparison of the skylines of the graphs in Fig. 2E and F, the
results obtained with set 1 siRNAs are the same as those
obtained with set 2 siRNAs. It should be noted that siBRG1
of set 2 suppressed NHEJ activity but not the accumulation of
GFP-KU and GFP-XRCC4, suggesting that this siBRG1 has an
off-target effect on a factor required for accomplishment of
NHEJ but not for the accumulation of KU at DSB. Thus, besides
the ATPase factor, SNF5, BAF60a, BAF60c, BAF155, BAF170,
and two ARID1 proteins are necessary for NHEJ.
We used H1299 or its derivative cell line, in which one of the
ATPase core subunit BRG1 is not expressed but BRM is
expressed. We suppressed BRM expression and obtained the
accumulation of GFP-KU by expression of BRG1 (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that either ATPase subunit, BRM or
BRG1, is required and enough for KU accumulation at DSB.
Suppression of ARID1A and ARID1B increased cellular
sensitivity to IR in U2OS cell
The above results suggest the involvement of ARID1A,
ARID1B, and some other SWI/SNF subunits in NHEJ repair.
We next examined the effects of SWI/SNF factor's suppression
on colony-forming ability in U2OS cells exposed to IR. U2OS
cell was chosen for analysis of cellular effect of unrepaired DNA
damage. In U2OS cell, all the SWI/SNF factors tested here,
including both BRM and BRG1, are expressed (Supplementary
Fig. S4). We used set 2 siRNA because of cross reactivity of set
1 siRNA for ARID1B against ARID1A (Supplementary Fig. S2A,
left top blot). In Fig. 3A (blots) suppression effects on ARID1A
and/or ARID1B are shown together with those on KU70 and
KU80 (siKU70/80) in U2OS cells. If the expression of either
ARID1A or ARID1B gene was suppressed, cells were mildly
sensitive to IR. Importantly, double suppression of both ARID1
genes did not further increase the sensitivity to IR, as was the
case in the previous NHEJ assays, suggesting that both ARID1A
and ARID1B contribute to the same pathway of cellular resistance. Simultaneous suppression of KU70 and KU80 provided
cells with higher sensitivity to IR than the ARID1A and ARID1B
suppression, suggesting that KU may be able to contribute
to IR resistance even in the absence of the ARID1 proteins.
Because the cells suppressed with KU70/80 and ARID1A, or
KU70/80 and ARID1B expression showed sensitivity at the level
of KU depleted cells, indicating that KU and ARID1 proteins
function in the same pathway. Cells with simultaneous suppression of KU70/80 and ARID1 showing slightly resistant than
KU70/80-depleted cells might be because of less effective
knockdown of KU proteins after triple suppression (Fig. 3A,
left bottom blots).

of the SWI/SNF subunits, SNF5, BAF155, BAF170, BAF60a, and
BAF60c, which were shown to be required for efﬁcient NHEJ in
the previous assays, increased cellular sensitivity to IR, which
was as sensitive as those of ARID1 suppression, whereas
BAF53a and BAF57, suppression of which did not inﬂuence
NHEJ in the previous assays, were not necessary for IR resistance. Thus, the results of NHEJ assays are consistent with the
sensitivity to IR of cells.
Suppression of SWI/SNF factors sensitizes cells to
cisplatin
In order to know the inﬂuence of drug used for cancer
therapy on the SWI/SNF-depleted cells, we applied cisplatin,
a DNA intra- and interstrand crosslinks (ICL)–inducing
agent. DNA damage induced by cisplatin is repaired by
several pathways, including nucleotide excision repair
(NER), homologous recombination, and translesion synthesis (32). Suppression of ARID1A as well as ARID1B sensitized
cells to cisplatin more signiﬁcantly than IR but double
knockdown of both ARID1 proteins did not increase the
cellular sensitivity of single suppression (Fig. 4A). Suppression of SNF5, BAF155, BAF170, BAF60a, and BAF60c sensitized cells at the same level as ARID1A and ARID1B suppression, whereas suppression of BAF53a or BAF57 expression did not inﬂuence to cellular resistance to cisplatin (Fig.
4B). These data suggest that the SWI/SNF factors required
for NHEJ and cellular resistance to IR are important for the
cisplatin resistance as well. Correspondingly, we found that
ARID1A- and/or ARID1B-depleted cells are sensitive to UV
irradiation (Fig. 4C). Previously, the SWI/SNF complex in
yeast and mammalian SNF5 have been reported to contribute to NER of UV damage in human cells (25, 33), suggesting
that the SWI/SNF complex, including ARID1A and ARID1B,
responds to various types of DNA damage and contributes at
least to NHEJ and NER. Further analysis is required for
understanding the role of the SWI/SNF factors in the repair
processes.
Interdependent protein stability of the SWI/SNF factors
required for cellular resistance to DNA damage
Because expression of SWI/SNF factors can be inﬂuenced by
transcriptional regulation of other factors and protein stability
is often acquired by protein–protein interactions, we analyzed
the effects of suppression of each of the SWI/SNF factors on the
expression of the others in H1299. Fig. 5A depicts the effects of
suppression of ARID1A or/and ARID1B on the expression of
the other SWI/SNF factors in the H1299 cell line using 2 sets of
siRNA. H1299 cells were used for this purpose, because most of
the SWI/SNF factors examined are expressed properly except
BRG1 (Fig. 5A). Western blots showed that suppression of
ARID1A obtained with either set of siRNA mildly reduced the
level of BAF155 as well as that of SNF5 more mildly. However,
suppression of ARID1B had no apparent inﬂuence on the
expression of the BAF proteins examined. We further analyzed
the interrelationships of the expression of other factors used in
the experiments of this article (Fig. 5B). Because off-target
effect of the suppression cannot be excluded, only when the
results of 2 sets of suppression experiments were consistent,

to IR, but no increase in the effect, even if both ARID1 proteins are

we deﬁned the relation as interactive. Fig. 5C summarized the
results shown in Fig. 5B, in which a decrease of stability of one
factor by suppression of other factor is indicated with a coming
arrow. Suppression of SNF5 signiﬁcantly decreased the level of
BAF170 and BAF155 as well as ARID1B, but not ARID1A,
whereas suppression of either BAF170 or BAF155 decreases
the expression of SNF5. Suppression of ARID1A strongly and
mildly decreased the expression of BAF155 and SNF5, respectively (Fig. 5A), suggesting that this decrease of SNF5

and ARID1B (37), have been reported by immunoprecipitation
method.
SWI/SNF factors required for the accumulation of GFPBRM at laser-irradiated site
An ATPase core subunit of the SWI/SNF complex is essential
for the remodeling of chromatin structure. We, therefore,
asked which SWI/SNF subunits are necessary for the recruitment of the ATPase subunit, BRM, to DSB sites. GFP-BRM and
GFP-BRG1 have been reported to accumulate at DSBs in
response to laser-micro irradiation (26). H1299 cells were
treated with either set 1 or set 2 siRNA for SWI/SNF factors
and the accumulation of GFP-BRM at laser-irradiated DNA
damage sites was evaluated (Fig. 5D). Results of either siRNA
set coincide very well and suppression of ARID1A, ARID1B,
SNF5, and BAF60c, but not the other factors, reduced GFPBRM accumulation at laser-irradiated sites. It suggests that the
above four (but not other) subunits are necessary for the
recruitment of BRM to DSB sites and both ARID1 proteins
cooperate in this process.
Expression of SWI/SNF factors in lung cancer cell lines
To examine expression of SWI/SNF subunits in cancer cells,
we performed Western blot analysis of the ATPases (BRG1 and
BRM) and other subunits (SNF5, BAF53a, BAF60a, BAF60c,
BAF155, BAF170, ARID1A, and ARID1B) in the total extracts of
various lung cancer cell lines (see Supplementary Table S1 for
their cell types; Fig. 5E). Blots were overexposed to clarify the
absence of expression of each factor in the cell lines. Expression
of various SWI/SNF factors examined in this article is much
less in most cancer cells than in H1299 cell line, which is shown
at the most left lane in the blot. Signiﬁcant reduction or loss in
the expression of ARID1A or ARID1B was observed very
frequently (27.7% or 33.3%, respectively) in the cancer cell
lines tested and that of ATPase subunits, BRG1 and BRM, was
also quite frequent (44.4% and 33.3%, respectively), whereas
alterations in the expression of BAF60a, BAF60c, BAF53a, and
SNF5 were rare but present. A similar result has been reported
in breast cancer cell lines (38), suggesting that loss of expression of SWI/SNF factors is a common feature in cancer cells.
Reduction in gene expression of SWI/SNF factors may be
explained either by genomic mutation–like ARID1A or by
epigenetic silencing. Suppression of chromatin remodeling
function required for cellular development and gene regelation may be advantageous for proliferation of cancer cell.
Multiple silencing of the expression of SWI/SNF factors in
cancer cells may be achieved by loss of interaction partner as
shown above. These results suggest that cancer cells tend to

suppress chromatin remodeling for rapid proliferation and
ignore its function in DNA damage response and repair.
In summary, we have examined 10 well-known SWI/SNF
factors and found that the BAF complex, including both
ARID1A and ARID1B, contributes to NHEJ and cellular resistance to IR and cisplatin. The results show a difference in
chromatin remodeling factors required for transcription regulation and DNA damage response. Importantly, although
ARID1A and ARID1B are mutually exclusive variant subunits
in the SWI/SNF complex with respect to transcription regulation (39), both ARID1 proteins play essential roles in DNA
damage response and are required for recruiting the ATPase
subunit of the complex to DNA damage site. Among the BAF
factors, we found interdependent protein stability, which may
explain very frequent silencing of expression of the factors in
various types of primary and established cancer cells (Fig. 5E).
Although cancer cells become more resistant to DNA damage
with mutated p53, cells lacking the expression of SWI/SNF
factors identiﬁed here are DNA repair deﬁcient, and that is a
fundamental vulnerability of the cells and may be useful for
cancer therapy.
