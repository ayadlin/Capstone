ABSTRACT
Developing the Wnt pathway inhibitors has been considered as a therapeutic
approach for cancers and other Wnt-related diseases. Previously we found that the
G-rich sequence of WNT1 promoter is capable of forming G-quadruplex structure
and stabilizing agents for Wnt1-mediated signaling pathway. Using a established
cell-based drug screen system that enabled the evaluation of WNT1 expression
activity in a G-quadruplex structure dependent manner, we evaluated a series of
6-substituted 9-chloro-11H-indeno[1,2-c]quinolin-11-one derivatives that potentially
inhibit the Wnt1-mediated signaling pathway. The most potent compound SJ26
showed repression of WNT1 activity in a G-quadruplex structure-dependent manner.
Moreover, compound SJ26 inhibited the WNT1-mediated downstream signaling
pathway and suppressed migration activity of cancer cells. Thus, we have identified
a tetracyclic azafluorenone, SJ26, that is capable of binding to G-quadruplex DNA
structure, repressing WNT1 expression, and inhibiting cell migration.

activation of Wnt signaling is observed in a variety of
tumors. Previous studies reported that high levels of
WNT1 expression in patients are associated with advanced
metastasis [7–9]. and the overall survival is lower in
patients with Wnt1-positive cancer. Thus, developing
the Wnt pathway inhibitors has been considered as a
therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with
cancers and other Wnt-related diseases [10, 11].
Small molecule inhibitors of the Wnt signaling
pathways have been designed to target mediators of Wntsignaling pathway [11]. These compounds mainly aim to
decrease the levels of β-catenin [12–16]. Agents targeting
Wnt directly have also been developed. For example, the
anti-Wnt1 antibody was used to block the stimulation

INTRODUCTION
Tumor metastasis is the most common cause of
cancer related-death. Targeting metastasis is considered
as one of the highest priorities for researches in antitumor
agents [1]. The Wnt-mediated signal pathway regulates
various cellular functions, including proliferation, survival,
migration, and development by trigger downstream
signaling cascades [2]. Many of the Wnt-targeted genes
are involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis. For
example, myc and cyclin D1 are involved in proliferation
and WISP1 is involved in angiogenesis [3, 4]. Wrch1
and MMP7 are also known to be involved in migration
and invasion of cancer cells [5, 6]. Clinically, aberrant

Significantly, the G-rich sequence of the WNT1 promoter
contains four runs of at least three contiguous guanines
that are capable of forming G-quadruplex structures under
physiological conditions [19, 20].
To facilitate the analysis of WNT1 expression,
we ligated downstream to the WNT1 promoter a
reporter gene, SEAP, to generate a WNT1 promoterdriven reporter construct, pWNT1-SEAP. We have
also constructed two mutants that failed to form
G-quadruplex structure, m1 and m6 (Figure 2A). The
expression of SEAP can then be used as the criterion
for the measurement of wild-type and mutant WNT1
expression efficiency. Stable human lung carcinoma cell
(H1299) lines carrying wild-type or mutant plasmids
were selected. Although reporter analysis using transient
transfection method to introduce reporter plasmids into
cells produces better results in general, the approach
is not suitable for drug screening because it needs
additional steps for the analysis. These additional
steps are prone to introduce variations in the screens.
Moreover, transfection step requires additional reagents
that are not economic for large-scale screens. Thus,
stable clones were employed in drug screens.
The basal phosphatase activities under the control
of wild-type or mutants promoters were first analyzed. We
detected similar phosphatase activities for wild-type, the
Wnt1-m1, and the Wnt1-m6 promoters, suggesting that the
mutation did not affect the general transcriptional activity
of the WNT1 promoter (Figure 2B). To test if our reporter
system is capable of differentiate G-quadruplex structuremediated repression of WNT1 expression, the SEAP
expression was monitored in the presence of 3,6-bis(1methyl-4-vinylpyridinium) carbazole diiodide (BMVC)
because it was shown to bind and stabilize the G-quadruplex
structure at WNT1 promoter [19]. Upon treatment with
BMVC, the expressions of SEAP from the wild-type
promoter were reduced (Figure 2C). In contrast, the
expression efficiency of mutant promoters did not respond
to BMVC treatments. Thus, formation of G-quadruplex
structure is required for suppressing WNT1 expression by
BMVC. This result indicated that our reporter construct is
capable of monitoring the expression of WNT1. Moreover,
addition of WNT1-m1 and -m6 mutation enables the
evaluation of whether the repression requires G-quadruplex
structure. Thus, the cells harboring pWNT1-SEAP or its
mutants could be used as a tool to monitor the expression
of WNT1 in a G-quadruplex structure dependent manner.

of Wnt1 downstream signaling pathway. Treatment of
anti-Wnt1 antibody was shown to reduce the growth of
hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer both
in vivo and in vitro [17, 18].
Previous our study reported that the G-rich sequence
of WNT1 promoter is capable of forming both hairpin and
G-quadruplex structures in the presence of potassium ion [19,
20]. Significantly, the Wnt1-mediated signaling pathway can
be repressed upon the addition of G-quadruplex stabilizing
agents in cancer cells. Consequently, the migration and
invasion activities of cancer cells were also decreased [19].
Thus, it is likely that suppression of tumor metastasis can
be achieved through stabilizing the G-quadruplex forming
sequence located at the WNT1 promoter.
Diverse anthracycline derivatives (e.g. doxorubicin,
daunorubicin, mitoxantrone and ametantrone) have been
shown to have anti-proliferative (or cytostatic) properties.
We and others showed that the structurally related
anthraquinone compounds can stabilize G-quadruplex
structure formed by telomeric DNA sequences and
inhibit telomerase or topoisomerase activity [21–33].
Camptothecin (CPT) and TAS-103 are also cytotoxic
quinoline alkaloid derivatives that show potent
topoisomerase (topo) I and/or topo II inhibition activities
[34–37]. Two related CPT family members, irinotecan
and topotecan, are currently used clinically as anticancer
chemotherapy drugs [38, 39]. Based on the structures of
anthracycline, here we design and synthesize a series of
6-substituted 9-chloro-11H-indeno[1,2-c]quinolin-11-one
derivatives by varying the side chains with heterocyclic
amine moieties and lipophilic alkyl chains (Figure 1). We
have also integrated the pharmocophore of camptothecin
(CPT) and TAS-103 into our drug design [40, 41]. The
synthesis and results of these series of compounds
against various cell lines and other SAR evaluation
will be reported in a separate paper. In this study, the
G-quadruplex structure-dependent WNT1 repression
activities of these newly synthesized compounds were
analyzed by a cell-based assay system. We found that
compound SJ26 showed potent inhibitory effects to the
Wnt1-mediated downstream signaling pathway in a
G-quadruplex structure dependent manner and inhibited
the migration activity of cancer cells. Our results suggested
the tetracyclic azafluorenones are potent WNT1 repressors.

Inhibitory effect of compound SJ26 on the WNT1
expression of G-quadruplex dependent manner

Functional analysis of human WNT1 proximal
promoter using reporter assays revealed that the 277-bp
upstream sequence of WNT1 is sufficient for the control
of developmentally regulated expression [42, 43].
Sequence analysis of the 277-bp sequence identified two
TATA boxes and a stretch of extremely G-rich sequence.

cells. To facilitate effective identification of compounds

htm). The relative WNT1 expressions by these compounds
at one-dose (10 μM) were first determined in these cells.
We reasoned that an effective inhibitor should give good
inhibitory effect at this concentration. The numbers
reported (values between 0 and 100) for the one-dose
assays represented the WNT1 promoter activities relative
to the no-drug control that were determined by SEAP
assays (Table 1). To rule out compounds that showed
apparent SEAP repression activities by inhibiting cell
growth, MTT assays were also introduced into our
screen. It is to eliminate compounds that showed WNT1
repressing activities non-selectively. Compounds that

exhibited significant WNT1 promoter inhibition and did
not show grow inhibitory activity in the one-dose screen
are selected and further evaluated.
As shown in Table 1, more than half [13 out of
25 including: SJ3 (17.1%), SJ4 (17.4%), SJ5 (23.0%),
SJ6 (33.3%), SJ7 (34.0%), SJ10 (30.1%), SJ17
(38.4%), SJ18 (34.5%), SJ21 (24.7%), SJ22 (47.1%),
SJ23 (49.2%), SJ26 (42.7%), and SJ27 (42.0%)] of
the tested compounds repressed more than 50% of the
SEAP activity in wild-type WNT1 promoter, suggesting
that this series of analogs are potent repressors of
WNT1 expression. At 10 μM concentration, none of
the synthesized derivatives showed potent cytotoxicity,
indicating that the observed WNT1 repressing activities
were not due to cellular toxicity (Table 1). To identify
compounds that repressed WNT1 expression through the

affect the basal expression level of WNT1. The H1299 cells harboring wild-type, WNT1-m1, and Wnt1-m6 reporters were analyzed for
their basal expression activity. The relative phosphatase activities of wild-type, WNT1-m1, and WNT1-m6 mutant were presented using
the wild-type level as 100%. C. BMVC repressed WNT1 expression required G-quadruplex structure formation. The H1299 cells harboring
wild-type, WNT1-m1, and WNT1-m6 reporters were incubated with the indicated concentrations of BMVC for 2 days. The phosphatase
activities were then analyzed using the activity of DMSO-treated cells as 100%. Asterisks indicate p < 0.05.

structure of WNT1 promoter, we applied circular
dichroism (CD) to monitor the melting temperature (Tm)
of WNT1 G-quadruplex. Oligonucleotide containing the
G-quadruplex-forming sequences of WNT1 promoter
(−193 to −167) were synthesized and analyzed by CD
spectormetry. The CD spectrum of WNT1 oligonucleotide
displayed a positive band at 264 nm and a negative band
at 240 nm together with a relative weak positive band at
292 nm in the presence of 5 mM K+ (Figure 4A). The
result is consistent with our previous observation that
WNT1 oligonucleotide forms a mixed parallel/antiparallel
folding pattern with at least two different G-quadruplex
conformations [19, 20]. Addition of SJ26 did not
greatly affect the overall CD spectrum of the WNT1
G-quadruplexes. The 265-nm CD band was then measured
as a function of temperature to determine the Tm of WNT1
G-quadruplexes in the presence of SJ26. Here we used
relatively low molar ratio of SJ26 (3 μM) to WNT1 DNA
(5 μM) in our analysis. High molar ratio of SJ26 was not
used because we consider that high molar ratio of SJ26
relative to its target DNA is not the pharmacologically
equivalent concentration. We found that the Tm of WNT1
G-quadruplexes was elevated from 54.2 to 57.7°C in the
presence of 3 μM SJ26, suggesting that it could thermally
stabilize the WNT1 G-quadruplexes (Figure 4B).

formation of G-quadruplex structure at its promoter, the
SEAP activity of wild-type, m1 and m6 mutants were
next compared (Table 1). Among the tested compounds,
only SJ26 did not repress m1 and m6 mutants, suggesting
that the observed repression in wild-type promoter is
G-quadruplex structure-dependent. We tested the SEAP
repressing activity and cytotoxicity using multiple doses
of SJ26. Consistent with the screening results, SJ26
selectively repressed wild-type WNT1 promoter activity
and the repression is G-quadruplex dependent as it did
not significantly affect the other two mutant promoters
(Figure 3). It is interesting to note that SJ26 did not
show significant cytotoxic activity at concentration up
to 30 μM. In addition to the stable lines that we used in
the screen (Figure 3A and 3B), we have also conducted
the reporter assays using transient transfection method to
introduce reporter constructs into H1299 cells. As shown
in Figure 3C, SJ26 selectively repressed the wild-type
promoter, further confirming that the observed WNT1repressing activity by SJ26 was mediated through the
formation of G-quadruplex structure formed at the WNT1
promoter. It is also apparent that transient transfect
method yielded better inhibitory results.

by SJ26 was also analyzed. Immunoblotting analysis
showed that the β-catenin levels were decreased by
SJ26 (Figure 5B). Since the Wnt1-mediated signaling
pathway was shown to have an important role in cancer
migration and invasion, the cellular effects of suppressing
WNT1 expression by SJ26 were analyzed. The migration
activity of SJ26-treated cells was first evaluated using
scratch assays. As shown in Figure 5C, the healing
activity of H1299 cells was decreased by SJ26 in a dose
dependent manner. The anti-proliferation efficacy of SJ26
was also determined. We found SJ26 did not affect the
proliferation of H1299 cells, suggesting the observed
healing-inhibitory effect was not due to inhibition of
proliferation. To show that the anti-healing effect of SJ26
was through suppression of Wnt1-mediated pathway, we

showed that the WNT1 mRNA level was significantly
decreased in cells that were treated with SJ26 (Figure 5A).
Moreover, immunoblotting analysis of the SJ26-treated
lung cancer H1299 cells showed that the Wnt1 protein
levels were greatly decreased by SJ26 treatment at a dose
as low as 1 μM (Figure 5B). These results indicate that
SJ26 could stabilize G-quadruplex structure and reduce
the expression of WNT1. It is also interesting to note that
although it requires ~10 μM to observed the repressing
effect in our cell-based SEAP reporter system, SJ26 at
concentration as low as 1 μM was able to suppress the
endogenous WNT1 expression. Although the reason is
not clear to us, the apparent differences might be due to
the difference of sensitivity in these assay systems. The

that expressing of excess amount of Wnt1 should reverse

Suppression of Wnt1-mediated cell migration by
SJ26 was not limited to H1299 cells

H1299 cells. Both the migration activities of MCF7 and
Hep3B cells were also inhibited by SJ26, although not
as effective as in H1299 cells. It was noted that the level
of Wnt1/β-catenin repression by SJ26 correlated with
their reduction in migration activity. Thus, the cellular
context in different cell types might also have a role in
modulating the repressing effects of SJ26. Nevertheless,
the correlation between Wnt1/β-catenin repressing and
migration inhibition by SJ26 provides strong indication
that SJ26 inhibit the migration activity of cancer cells
through repressing the expression of WNT1.

To test the effects of WNT1 expression and
migration upon SJ26 treatments on other cancer cell
lines, the MCF7 (breast cancer) and Hep2B 2.17 (liver
cancer) cells were also tested. We found SJ26 effectively
repressed the expression of WNT1 and β-catenin in
these cells (Figure 6A). The migration activity was next
evaluated using trans-well assays. As shown in Figure

DISCUSSION

Azafluorenone
compounds
show
diverse
pharmacological activities. For example, they have been
reported to have antifungal, antimicrobial, and antimalarial
activities [54–56]. They were also shown to have cytotoxic
properties to induce cancer cells into apoptosis [57–59].
Moreover, an arylindenopyrimidine was shown to be a
potent dual A2A/A1 receptor antagonist that might have
the potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative
disorder such as Parkinson’s disease [60]. Our results
in stabilization of the G-quadruplex structure point to
a new pharmacological direction that azafluorenone
compounds could also target to specific DNA structure.
Much work yet needs to be done to fully understand
the precise mechanisms of these series compounds. In
conclusion, we demonstrated that SJ26 play a novel anticancer mechanism, and it has the potential to be further
developed into anti-cancer drugs that targets the migration
activity of cancer cells.

Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway is
implicated in driving the formation of various human
cancers. Many cancers show evidence of inappropriate
activation of the Wnt pathway, including raised levels
of β-catenin [44, 45]. Moreover, defective Wnt signaling
might also play a role in the generation and maintenance
of cancer stem cells [46]. Thus, Wnt signaling plays a
pivotal role in cancer, and compounds that dampen Wnt
pathway activity could provide useful molecular targeted
therapeutics for the treatment of cancers [11, 47–49]. An
assortment of small molecule inhibitors has been identified
that target the mediators of the Wnt signaling pathway.
For example, compound ICG-001 was shown to block
the interaction between β-catenin and the transcriptional
coactivator protein CREB binding protein (CBP) [50].
Recently, several new compounds that target tankyrase
activity were also developed such as NVP-TNKS656
[51], G007-LK [52], and LGK974 [53]. Moreover, a
small-molecule porcupine (PORCN) acyltransferase
inhibitor, IWP-2, was found to inhibit the secretion of
functional WNT ligands [13]. Here we identify repressors
that inhibit WNT1 expression through stabilizing the
G-quadruplex structure formed at its promoter. The
6-substituted 9-chloro-11H-indeno[1,2-c]quinolin-11-one
derivatives are capable of inhibiting the WNT-signaling
pathway through suppressing the expression of WNT1.
Thus, our results support a unique approach to inhibit
WNT-mediated signaling pathway through suppression of
WNT1 expression. The identified target compounds should
have potential to be further developed into drugs to treat
Wnt-related diseases.
The cell-based reporter assay we established
enables efficient monitoring and analyzing WNT1
expression. In our screen system, we have also added
WNT1-m1 and -m6 mutation constructs to enable
the determination of whether the repression requires
G-quadruplex structure formation. Thus, this cell-based
system could be applied to gauge the expression of WNT1
in a G-quadruplex structure dependent manner. Using the
reporter system, we have successfully identified SJ26.
SJ26 effectively represses the expression of WNT1, its
downstream signaling pathway, and the migration activity
of cancer cells. Importantly, the WNT1 inhibitory effect
mediated by SJ26 appears to be selective and specific
as it does not affect the general proliferation property
of cells at concentrations as high as 30 μM. It is also
interesting to note that SJ26 only moderately elevates the
melting temperature of a G-quadruplex structure formed
by WNT1 promoter sequences. Although moderate, the
melting-temperature elevation is sufficient to repress
WNT1 expression and inhibit its downstream signaling
pathway. Thus, the results suggest that our reporter
assay could identify G-quadruplex stabilizers with high
sensitivity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and test derivatives
In this study, we systematically synthesized
tetracyclic and heterocyclic pharmacophores by
introducing a series of side chains linked to the 9-chloro11H-indeno[1,2-c]quinolin-11-one moiety. The synthesis
of
3,6-bis(1-methyl-4-vinylpyridinium)carbazole
diiodide (BMVC) has been described previously [61].
General chemicals used in this study were purchased
from (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lines (human lung cancer
H1299; human breast cancer MCF7; human liver cancer
Hep3B 2.17) were obtained from the Bioresource
Collection and Research Center in Taiwan. All reactions
were monitored by TLC (silica gel 60 F254). 1H NMR
and 13C NMR were measured on Varian GEMINI-300
(300  MHz) or Agilent 400 MR DD2 (400 MHz); δ
values are in ppm relative to TMS as an internal standard.
Multiplicities are recorded as s (singlet), d (doublet),
t (triplet), q (quartet), quin (quintuplet), dd (doublet of
doublets), dt (triplet of doublets), td (doublet of triplets),
m (multiplet), and br (broadened). Mass spectral analyses
were conducted using high resolution electron impact
ionization (HREI, Finnigan MAT MAT-95XL) in the
Instrumentation Center of National Tsing-Hua University,
Hsinchu, Taiwan. Melting points of synthetic compounds
were determined with a Büchi B-545 melting point
apparatus. The purity of all compounds was analyzed
on a C18 reverse-phase column (XBridge BEH Shield
RP18 Column, 130Å, 5 μm, 4.6 mm X 250 mm, Waters)
by HPLC (model L-2000, HITACHI) with UV detection
(model L-2400, HITACHI). Compound was dissolved
in MeOH; the mobile phase was water and MeOH.
A preliminary evaluation of the UV spectra was carried
out by spectrophotometric analysis to determine the value
of λmax for each compound. The purities of the synthetic

DNA preparation

compounds for biological evaluation were greater than
95%. Reagents and solvents were purchased from Merck
and Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification.
Typical experiments illustrating the general procedures
for the preparation of the compounds are described
below.

All oligonucleotides were purchased from Bio
Basic (Ontario, Canada) and used without further
purification. DNA samples were prepared by dissolving
oligonucleotides in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). DNA
concentrations were determined using a UV-visible
absorption nanophotometer (Implen). KCl at 5 mM was
added to the DNA samples 70 min before experiments. For
SJ26 treatments, the DNA samples were incubated with
SJ26 for 30 min before experiments.

Cell-based assay for monitoring WNT1
expression
The WNT1 promoter ranging from −600 to 201
relative to the transcription starting site was PCRamplified from H1299 genomic DNA and cloned
upstream to a secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP)
reporter gene to generate pWNT1-SEAP [19]. This DNA
fragment contains the G-quadruplex forming sequences
and the cis-regulatory elements of WNT1 transcription.
To construct a mutant that fails to form G-quadruplex
structure, plasmid pWNT1-SEAP was used as the
template for mutagenesis using Pfu DNA polymerase
(Stratagene). The resulting mutations were verified by
DNA sequencing of the plasmids. These plasmids were
introduced into cancer cell line H1299 and the stable
cell lines harboring these plasmids were then isolated.
Compared to their parental H1299 cell, no apparent
change in the morphology or growth rate was observed
in these stable lines.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectra and melting
temperature
The CD spectra were recorded using a
spectropolarimeter (J-815, Jasco, Japan) with a bandwidth
of 2 nm at a scan speed of 50 nm/min and a step resolution
of 0.2 nm under N2 over the spectral range of 210–350
nm to monitor the G4 structures. Thermal melting curves
were recorded by a Peltier thermal coupler chamber (PFD425S/15, Jasco) and the molar ellipticity was monitored at
265 nm between 10 and 100°C with a temperature ramping
rate of 1°C/min rate. The melting temperature (Tm) was
measured from the first differential of the melting curve.

Quantification of WNT1 RNA
The real-time quantitative RT-PCR was also used to
determine the mRNA of WNT1. Cells were treated with
SJ26 for 1 day and then subjected to RT-PCR analysis.
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Sigma)
and reverse-transcribed by random hexamers using
cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystem).
The reverse-transcribed products were then analyzed
using Cyber Green I system (FastStart Universal
SYBR Green Master, Roche Applied Science). Primers
used for PCR reactions were: WNT1 (forward primer
5′-CTGTCCTGCCTCCTCATC-3′ and reverse primer
5′ -GGACCCAGCACAATAAATAGTT-3′); GAPDH
(forward primer 5′-TAACTCTGGTAAAGTGGATA-3′
and reverse primer 5′-AAGATGGTGATGGGATTT-3′).
The parameter Ct is defined as the fractional cycle number
at which the fluorescence is generated by the Cyber
green I system. Quantifications were first determined by
normalizing the Ct values of the tested mRNA with the Ct
of GAPDH. The relative values were then obtained using
no drug treatment as 100%. Quantification results were
obtained from three independent experiments.

SEAP assay [62]
Secreted alkaline phosphatase was used as the
reporter gene to monitor the transcriptional activity of
WNT1. About 2 × 104 each of cells were grown in 96-well
plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h and then changed
with fresh media. Indicated amounts of drugs were added
and then incubated for another 24 h. The culture media
were collected and heated at 65°C for 10 min to inactivate
heat-labile phosphatases. To assay phosphatase activity.
an equal amount of SEAP buffer (2 M diethanolamine,
1 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM L-homoarginine) was added
to the media, and p-nitrophenylphosphate was added to
a final concentration of 12 mM. Absorptions at 405 nm
were taken (BECKMAN BIOMEK 3000), and the rate of
absorption increase was determined.

MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay
Cells were first grown in 96-well plates (~2000 cells
per well) in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37°C. To examine
the cytotoxic effect of the tested compounds, cells were
incubated with different concentrations of compounds
for 24 h. The cytotoxicity was then determined by
adding MTT solution to cells to a final concentration
of 0.45 mg/ml and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The
resulting formazan crystals was dissolved and analysed
spectrophotometrically at the absorbance of 570 nm.

The SJ26-treated H1299 cells were washed twice
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed using
radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton

and subjected to scratch assay. The drug treated cells were
plated and scratched with a pipette tip to generate a cellfree zone. Cells were then incubated at 1% serum culture
medium to avoid further cell proliferation. Migration of
cells toward the cell-free zone was monitored after 24 h
using a Leica DFC 420c camera (Leica Microsystems),
and the migration rates were determined. The relative
healing activities were obtained using the value of solvent
control as 100%.

in the inner chamber of Millicell Hanging Cell Culture
Insert (pore size 8.0 μm, Merck Millipore) in a serumfree medium and with 10% serum medium in the outer
chamber. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 6 h to allow
the migration toward the outer side of the inner chamber.
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 min, and
then permeabilized with methanol for 20 min. The cells on
the inner layer were softly removed with a cotton swab,
and the adherent cells on outer surface were stained with
0.3% crystal violet dye for 15 min and then counted. The
relative migration activities were obtained using the value
of solvent control as 100%.
