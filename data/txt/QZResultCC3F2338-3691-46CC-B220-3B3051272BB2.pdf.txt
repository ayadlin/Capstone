Abstract
Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of the type 5 cGMP (cyclic guanosine 30 ,50 -monophosphate)specific phosphodiesterase that is used clinically to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Here, we report that sildenafil has differential effects on cell surface ABC transporters such as ABCB1,
ABCC1, and ABCG2 that modulate intracompartmental and intracellular concentrations of chemotherapeutic
drugs. In ABCB1-overexpressing cells, nontoxic doses of sildenafil inhibited resistance and increased the
effective intracellular concentration of ABCB1 substrate drugs such as paclitaxel. Similarly, in ABCG2-overexpressing cells, sildenafil inhibited resistance to ABCG2 substrate anticancer drugs, for example, increasing the
effective intracellular concentration of mitoxantrone or the fluorescent compound BODIPY-prazosin. Sildenafil
also moderately inhibited the transport of E217bG and methotrexate by the ABCG2 transporter. Mechanistic
investigations revealed that sildenafil stimulated ABCB1 ATPase activity and inhibited photolabeling of ABCB1
with [125I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin (IAAP), whereas it only slightly stimulated ABCG2 ATPase activity and
inhibited photolabeling of ABCG2 with [125I]-IAAP. In contrast, sildenafil did not alter the sensitivity of parental,
ABCB1-, or ABCG2-overexpressing cells to non-ABCB1 and non-ABCG2 substrate drugs, nor did sildenafil affect
the function of another ABC drug transporter, ABCC1. Homology modeling predicted the binding conformation
of sildenafil within the large cavity of the transmembrane region of ABCB1. Overall, we found that sildenafil
inhibits the transporter function of ABCB1 and ABCG2, with a stronger effect on ABCB1. Our findings suggest
a possible strategy to enhance the distribution and potentially the activity of anticancer drugs by jointly
using a clinically approved drug with known side effects and drug–drug interactions. Cancer Res; 71(8); 3029–41.

across extra- and intracellular membranes, ranging from ions,
sugars, amino acids, vitamins, lipids, and drugs to larger
molecules such as oligosaccharides, oligopeptides, and even
higher molecular weight proteins (1). Several of these have
been identified as transporting cancer chemotherapeutics
agents including taxanes, anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids,
and topoisomerase inhibitors (1). These transporters were
discovered in in vitro models of drug resistance and have been
postulated to confer MDR in patients. At present, the major
members of the ABC transporters linked to MDR in cancer
cells include ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, ABCB1/MDR1), ABCCs
(MRP) and ABCG2 (BCRP/MXR/ABCP; ref. 2). These proteins
share the ability to transport a large number of structurally
diverse, mainly hydrophobic compounds from cells, but each
transporter has their own specific substrates (2). Initially, it
was hoped that inhibiting these transporters would restore the
sensitivity of drug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs and lead to a more efficacious treatment for cancer
patients. As a result, a number of compounds have been
identified with the ability to inhibit individual or several
transporters by blocking drug efflux, increasing drug accumulation and thus sensitizing resistant cancer cells. It has
been reported that cyclosporine A and VX-710 (biricodar) can

inhibit the function of multiple transporters including ABCB1,
ABCC1, and ABCG2 (3–5). Verapamil, LY475776, and V-104
can block the activity of ABCB1 and ABCC1 (3, 6, 7). GF-120918
(elacridar) suppresses the function of ABCB1 and ABCG2
(3, 7). Unfortunately, most of these inhibitors were ineffective
in clinical trials owing to their unfavorable side effects or toxic
pharmacokinetic interactions or simply because the magnitude of improvement in therapeutic outcome of these inhibitors with conventional chemotherapeutic agents was either
nonsignificant or inconclusive (2). Whether or not better
inhibitors of the ABC transporters could be identified that
would have a greater therapeutic effect is unknown and
in vitro studies continue to address this question. Meanwhile,
additional data regarding a role for the ABC transporters as
modulators of oral absorption and as determinants of sanctuary sites have emerged. These studies show that a number of
blood–tissue barriers are mediated at least, in part, by ABC
transporters. These include the blood–brain barrier, the
maternal–fetal barrier, the blood–testicular barrier, and an
apparent blood–cardiac muscle barrier (8). Although these
can be protective barriers, they can also prevent adequate
penetration of anticancer agents into needed tissue compartments. Thus, the identification of drugs that block ABC
transporters at such sites, increasing drug penetration, has
potential clinical benefit well beyond a "drug resistance
reversal strategy."
Discovering new functions of drugs already used in the
clinic is one of the important strategies for drug development.
In our previous studies, we found that several tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (erlotinib, lapatinib, nilotinib, and AG1478) could
reverse ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR by inhibiting their
transport function, but had no effect on ABCC1 (9–12). In
screening novel drugs that are already in clinical use for
potential effects to reverse MDR, we found that sildenafil
(Viagra), a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine
30 ,50 -monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type
5 (PDE5), reverses ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated substrate
efflux. Interestingly, sildenafil was shown in previous models
to increase cytotoxicity, presumably by different mechanisms
than drug uptake. Our results show that sildenafil significantly
inhibits ABCB1-mediated drug efflux, slightly inhibits ABCG2mediated drug efflux, while having no effect on efflux
mediated by ABCC1.

Cell lines and cell culture
The ABCB1-overexpressing drug-resistant cell line KB-C2
was established by stepwise selection of the parental human
epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB-3-1 in increasing concentrations of colchicine and was cultured in medium containing
2 mg/mL of colchicine (14). The ABCB1-overexpressing drugresistant cell line KB-V1 (generously provided by Dr. Michael
M. Gottesman, NCI, NIH) was established by step by step
increasing the concentration of vinblastine to KB-3-1 cells
and cultured in the medium with 1 mg/mL of vinblastine. An
ABCC1-overexpressing MDR cell line, KB-CV60, was also
derived from KB-3-1 cells and was maintained in medium
with 1 mg/mL of cepharanthine and 60 ng/mL of vincristine
(15). Both KB-C2 and KB-CV60 cell lines were kindly provided
by Dr. Shin-ichi Akiyama (Kagoshima University, Kagoshima,
Japan). HEK293/pcDNA3.1, ABCG2-482-R5, ABCG2-482-G2,
and ABCG2-482-T7 cells were established by selection with
2 mg/mL G418 after transfecting HEK293 with either empty
pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1 vector containing full length
ABCG2 coding either wild-type arginine (R) or mutant glycine
(G) or threonine (T) at amino acid 482, respectively (16). The
wild-type ABCG2-overexpressing drug-resistant cell line MCF7/Flv1000 was cultured in the medium with 1,000 nmol/L of
flavopiridol (17). The mutated ABCG2-overexpressing drugresistant cell line MCF-7/ADVP3000 was maintained in the
medium with 5 mg/mL of verapamil and 3 mg/mL of doxorubicin (17). Another G482 mutant ABCG2-overexpressing drugresistant cell line S1-M1-80 was maintained in the medium with
80 mmol/L of mitoxantrone (17). The drug-resistant cell line S1/
Flv5000, which does not express ABCG2, was also generated
from S1 by increasing the amount of flavopiridol and was
maintained in the medium with 5 mmol/L of flavopiridol (R.
W.R. and S.E.B., unpublished data). All the cell lines were grown
as adherent monolayers in flasks with DMEM (Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium) culture medium (Hyclone Co.) containing 10% bovine serum at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2.
MTT cytotoxicity assay
Cells in 96-well plates were preincubated with or without
the reversing agents for 1 hour and then different concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs were added into designated
wells. After 68 hours of incubation, MTT solution (4 mg/mL)
was added to each well, and the plate was further incubated
for 4 hours, allowing viable cells to change the yellow-colored
MTT into dark-blue formazan crystals. Subsequently the
medium was discarded, and 100 mL of dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) was added into each well to dissolve the formazan
crystals. The absorbance was determined at 570 nm by an
OPSYS MR Microplate Reader from DYNEX Technologies, Inc.
Paclitaxel and mitoxantrone accumulation
Cells in 24-well plates were preincubated with or without
the reversing agents for 1 hour at 37 C, then incubated with

Reversal of MDR by Sildenafil

0.1 mmol/L [3H]-paclitaxel or 0.2 mmol/L [3H]-mitoxantrone
for 2 hours in the presence or absence of the reversing agents
at 37 C. After washing 3 times with ice-cold PBS, the cells were
typsinized and lysed in 10 mmol/L lysis buffer (pH 7.4,
containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS). Each sample
was placed in scintillation fluid and radioactivity was measured in a Packard TRI-CARB 1900CA liquid scintillation
analyzer from Packard Instrument Company, Inc.
Flow cytometric assays
Flow cytometric assays were carried out as previously
described (16). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and then resuspended in complete media (phenol red–free Iscove's modified
Eagle's medium, IMEM, with 10% fetal calf serum) containing
250 nmol/L BODIPY-prazosin alone or with various concentrations of the inhibitors for 30 minutes at 37 C. Cells were
then washed once in cold complete medium and then incubated for another 1 hour at 37 C in substrate-free media
continuing with or without the described concentrations of
the inhibitors to generate the efflux histograms. Subsequently,
cells were washed twice with cold DPBS (Dulbecco's PBS) and
placed on ice in a dark environment until ready for analysis.
Cells were analyzed on a FACSort flow cytometer equipped
with a 488-nm argon laser. For all samples, at least 10,000
events were collected. Cell debris was eliminated by gating on
forward versus side scatter, and dead cells were excluded on
the basis of propidium iodide staining.
In vitro transport assays
Transport assays were carried out using the rapid filtration
method as previously described (18). Membrane vesicles were
incubated with various concentrations of inhibitors for 1 hour
on ice, and then transport reactions were carried out at 37 C
for 10 minutes in a total volume of 50-mL medium (membrane
vesicles 10 mg, 0.25 mol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
10 mmol/L MgCl2, 4 mmol/L ATP or AMP, 10 mmol/L
phosphocreatine, 100 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase, and
0.25 mmol/L [3H]-E217bG, or 0.5 mmol/L [3H]-methotrexate).
Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 mL of ice-cold
stop solution (0.25 mol/L sucrose, 100 mmol/L NaCl, and 10
mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). During the rapid filtration step,
samples were passed through 0.22-mm GVWP filters (Millipore) presoaked in the stop solution. The filters were washed 3
times with 3 mL of ice-cold stop solution. Radioactivity was
measured by the use of a liquid scintillation counter.
ATPase assay of ABCB1 and ABCG2
The vanadate (Vi)-sensitive ATPase activity of ABCB1 or
ABCG2 in the membrane vesicles of High Five insect cells was
measured as previously described (19). The membrane vesicles (100 mg of protein/mL) were incubated in ATPase assay
buffer (50 mmol/L MES, pH 6.8, 50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L
sodium azide, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 2 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 1
mmol/L ouabain, and 10 mmol/L MgCl2) with or without 0.3
mmol/L vanadate at 37 C for 5 minutes and then incubated
with different concentrations of drugs at 37 C for 3 minutes.
The ATPase reaction was incubated by the addition of 5
mmol/L Mg-ATP. After incubating at 37 C for 20 minutes,

www.aacrjournals.org

the reactions were stopped by adding 0.1 mL of 5% SDS
solution. The liberated inorganic phosphate was measured
as previously described (20). In the inhibition assays, the
decrease in maximum Vi-sensitive ABCB1 or ABCG2 activity
by sildenafil was measured in the presence of verapamil at 50
mmol/L or FTC at 10 mmol/L, respectively.
Photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with
[125I]-IAAP
The photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP was conducted as previously described (21). The crude
membranes from High Five insect cells expressing ABCB1 and
MCF7/FLV1000 cells expressing R482 ABCG2 (50 mg of protein) were incubated at room temperature with different
concentrations of drugs in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with
[125I]-IAAP (5–7 nmol/L) for 5 minutes under subdued light.
The samples were photo-cross-linked by exposure to a 365 nm
UV light for 10 minutes at room temperature. ABCB1 and
ABCG2 were immunoprecipitated using BXP-21 antibodies,
respectively, as described previously (20). Both ABCB1 and
ABCG2 samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 7% Trisacetate NuPAGE gel, the gel was dried, and exposed to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at 70 C for 8 to 12 hours.
The radioactivity incorporated into the ABCB1 or ABCG2
band was quantified using the STORM 860 PhosphorImager
System and ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics).
Ligand structure preparation
Sildenafil and IAAP were built using the fragment dictionary
of Maestro 9.0 and energy minimized by Macromodel program
v9.7 (2009; Schr€
odinger, Inc.) using the OPLS-AA force field
(22) with the steepest descent followed by truncated Newton
conjugate gradient protocol. Partial atomic charges were
computed using the OPLS-AA force field. The low-energy
3D structures of sildenafil and IAAP were generated with
the following parameters present in LigPrep v2.3: different
protonation states at physiologic pH, all possible tautomers
and ring conformations.
Protein structure preparation
The X-ray crystal structure of ABCB1 in apoprotein state
(PDB ID: 3G5U) and in complex with inhibitors QZ59-RRR
(PDB ID: 3G6O) and QZ59-SSS (PDB ID: 3G61) obtained from
the RCSB Protein Data Bank were used to build the homology
model of human ABCB1 (23). Homology modeling was carried
out using the default parameters of Prime v2.1 as implemented in Maestro 9.0. The input file for amino acid sequence of
human ABCB1 in Prime structure prediction application was
obtained as FASTA file (UniProt accession number P08183.3)
extracted from http://www.uniprot.org. The cocrystal structures of ABCB1 from mouse model in complex with QZ59-RRR
and QZ59-SSS inhibitors were used as template for modeling
site 1 and site 2, respectively; whereas apoprotein ABCB1 was
used as a template for modeling site 3 and site 4. The resultant
alignment of human ABCB1 and mouse ABCB1 sequences
produced 87% sequence identity and 93% similarity. On the
resultant alignment built using default parameters, side
chains were optimized and residues were minimized. The

initial structure thus obtained was refined by means of default
parameters mentioned in protein preparation facility implemented in Maestro v9.0 and Impact program v5.5 (2009;
Schr€odinger, Inc.), in which the protonation states of residues
were adjusted to the dominant ionic forms at pH ¼ 7.4.
Refined human ABCB1 homology model was further used
to generate 4 different receptor grids by selecting QZ59-RRR
(site 1) and QZ59-SSS (site 2) bound ligands, all amino acid
residues known to contribute to verapamil binding (site 3) and
2 residues known to be common to 3 previous sites (site 4) as
shown in Supplementary Table S1.
Docking protocol
All docking calculations were done using the "Extra Precision" (XP) mode of Glide program v5.5 (2009; Schr€
odinger,
Inc.) and the default parameters. The top-scoring pose-ABCB1
complex was then subjected to energy minimization using
Macromodel program v9.7 using the OPLS-AA force field (22)
and used for graphical analysis. All computations were carried
out on a Dell Precision 470n dual processor with the Linux OS
(Red Hat Enterprise WS 4.0).
Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least 3 times and the
differences were determined by using the Student's t test. The
statistical significance was determined at P < 0.05.

Results
Sildenafil sensitizes ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs
To investigate the effect of sildenafil on ABC transporters,
we first examined the sensitivity of ABCB1-, ABCC1-, and
ABCG2-overexpressing cells to sildenafil. Notably, the results
of the MTT assay showed that sildenafil did not inhibit the
growth of any of the cell lines used in this study at concentrations up to 50 mmol/L (data not shown). Next, we examined
whether sildenafil could increase the sensitivity of ABCB1expressing drug-resistant cells to substrate drugs. As shown in
Table 1, the ABCB1-overexpressing cells KB-C2 and KB-V1
showed much higher IC50 values to ABCB1 substrates colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel than parent KB-3-1 cells did.
Sildenafil decreased the IC50 values of these drugs in KB-C2
and KB-V1 cells. Sildenafil at 2.5 mmol/L was able to moderately increase sensitivity to these 3 drugs. At 10 mmol/L,
sildenafil further increased the sensitivity of cells, and its
efficacy was comparable to that of the known ABCB1 inhibitor
verapamil used at the same concentration (24). Neither sildenafil nor verapamil alter the cytotoxicity of these chemotherapeutic drugs in parental KB-3-1 cells. However, the IC50
values of cisplatin, which is not a substrate of ABCB1 and
exhibited equal sensitivity in KB-3-1, KB-C2, and KB-V1 cells,
were not affected by either sildenafil or verapamil in these 3
cells. Subsequently, the effects of sildenafil on ABCC1- and
ABCG2-mediated drug resistance were also determined. In the
ABCC1-overexpressing KB-CV60 cells, sildenafil at 10 mmol/L
had no significant reduction of the IC50 value of vincristine, a
known substrate of ABCC1 (data not shown). It has been

3032

Cancer Res; 71(8) April 15, 2011

reported that mutations at amino acid 482 in ABCG2 alter the
substrate and antagonist specificity of ABCG2 (16, 25); therefore, we examined the reversing effect of sildenafil on both
wild-type (R482) and mutant (R482G and R482T) ABCG2overexpressing cells. As shown in Table 2, compared with
parental MCF-7 cells, MCF-7/Flv1000, and MCF-7/AdVp3000
cells exhibited high levels of resistance to ABCG2 substrates
flavopiridol, mitoxantrone, and SN-38, but not to the nonABCG2 substrate cisplatin. Similarly, the IC50 values for flavopiridol, mitoxantrone, and SN-38 in S1-M1-80 were significantly higher than those in parental S1 cells. Sildenafil was
able to slightly decrease the IC50 values for flavopiridol,
mitoxantrone, and SN-38 in cells expressing wild-type or
mutant ABCG2. At 50 mmol/L, sildenafil decreased IC50 values
for these 3 drugs in the ABCG2-expressing cell lines down to
levels that were observed when cytotoxicity assays were
carried out in the presence of the known specific ABCG2
inhibitor FTC at 2.5 mmol/L (17). However, the IC50 values of
these ABCG2 substrate drugs showed no significant difference
in the parental cells or the S1/FLV5000 cells, which do not
express ABCG2 but also are resistant to flavopiridol in the
presence or absence of sildenafil. Furthermore, when the nonABCG2 substrate drug cisplatin was used, either sildenafil or
FTC in any of the cell lines did not affect its IC50 values. A
similar phenomenon was observed in both wild-type and
mutant ABCG2-transfected HEK293 cells (Table 3). The representative cell survival curves are shown in Supplementary
Figure S1, which show that the survival curves in the presence
of sildenafil were remarkably shifted to left in the ABCB1- or
ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Based on the above results, it
appears that sildenafil significantly inhibits ABCB1-mediated
drug efflux and only partially reverses ABCG2-mediated efflux.
Sildenafil increases the accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel
in ABCB1-overexpressing cells, [3H]-mitoxantrone, and
BODIPY-prazosin in ABCG2-overexpressing cells
To investigate the potential mechanism by which sildenafil
sensitizes ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, we examined the effect of sildenafil on
the accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs in ABCB1- or
ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Intracellular [3H]-paclitaxel was
measured in ABCB1-overexpressing cells in the presence or
absence of sildenafil, and the results are shown in Figure 1A.
After 2 hours of incubation, the intracellular level of [3H]paclitaxel in ABCB1-overexpressing KB-C2 and KB-V1 cells
were significantly lower than that of the parental KB-3-1 cells.
Sildenafil at 10 mmol/L significantly increased the intracellular
level of [3H]-paclitaxel close to the effect of verapamil at 10
mmol/L in KB-C2 and KB-V1 cells. Neither sildenafil nor
verapamil altered the intracellular levels of [3H]-paclitaxel
in parental KB-3-1 cells. Similarly, the intracellular levels of
[3H]-mitoxantrone were measured in the ABCG2-overexpressing cells in the presence or absence of sildenafil (Fig. 1B–D).
The intracellular level of [3H]-mitoxantrone in cells expressing
either wild-type or mutant ABCG2 were significantly less than
that in parental cells. In the presence of sildenafil, either at
10 or 50 mmol/L, all ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines
displayed elevated intracellular [3H]-mitoxantrone levels,

and intracellular levels of [3H]-mitoxantrone increased with
increasing concentrations of sildenafil. However, the effects of
sildenafil at 50 mmol/L were less than those observed for FTC
at 2.5 mmol/L. Neither sildenafil nor FTC affected the intracellular levels of [3H]-mitoxantrone in parental cells.
In addition, we evaluated the effect of sildenafil on the
accumulation of a known fluorescent substrate of ABCG2
(16) in the ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Sildenafil enhanced
the accumulation of BODIPY-prazosin at 50 mmol/L in cells
expressing either wild-type or mutant ABCG2 but was weaker
than that of FTC at 2.5 mmol/L. Representative histograms for
BODIPY-prazosin are shown in Figure 2A. Taken together,
these data are in agreement with our cytotoxicity results
and suggest that sildenafil is able to inhibit the efflux function
of ABCB1 and ABCG2 leading to the significant increase of
intracellular accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel in ABCB1-over-

Sildenafil inhibits the transport of E217bG and
methotrexate by ABCG2
To assess the potency of sildenafil as an in vitro inhibitor of
ABCG2, the ability of sildenafil to inhibit the transport activity
of ABCG2 was analyzed using the chemotherapeutic drug
substrate [3H]-methotrexate and the physiologic substrate
[3H]-E217bG. In our previous study, only wild-type ABCG2
was shown as able to transport methotrexate and E217bG in
the in vitro transport system (11). Thus, we used membrane
vesicles prepared from HEK293/pcDNA3.1 and ABCG2482-R5
cells (Fig. 2B). Sildenafil significantly inhibited the rates of
both methotrexate and E217bG uptake in the membrane
vesicles of wild-type ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent

manner, but its inhibitory effect was weaker than that of FTC
at the same concentration. FTC also moderately decreased the
uptake rates of both methotrexate and E217bG in the membrane vesicles of HEK293/pcDNA3.1, but sildenafil did not.
These in vitro transport results suggest that sildenafil is able to
directly inhibit the transport function of E217bG and methotrexate in wild-type ABCG2-expressing cells.
Sildenafil stimulates the ATPase activity and affects the
[125I]-IAAP photolabeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2
Generally, the substrates of ABC transporters stimulate
their ATPase activity, and among the reversal agents, some
(e.g., verapamil) stimulate the activity, whereas others (e.g.,
cyclosporin A) inhibit ATP hydrolysis (26). To assess the
effect of sildenafil on the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and
ABCG2, the membrane vesicles of High Five insect cells
overexpressing ABCB1 or ABCG2 were used in the presence
of various concentrations of sildenafil under conditions that
suppressed the activity of other major membrane ATPases.
As shown in Figure 3A and B, sildenafil at the indicated
concentrations potently stimulated the ATPase activity of
ABCB1, but mildly stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCG2.
The concentrations of sildenafil required for 50% stimulation of ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2 were 5 to 10
and 0.25 to 0.5 mmol/L, respectively. These data indicate that
sildenafil may potentially be a weak substrate for ABCB1
compared with ABCG2.

The photoaffinity analogue of prazosin, [125I]-IAAP, which is
transported by both ABCB1 and ABCG2 (20), has been widely
used to determine the binding regions of ABCB1 and ABCG2
that interact with substrates and inhibitors. To test whether
sildenafil interacts at the prazosin binding site of ABCB1 or
ABCG2, the ability of sildenafil to prevent photolabeling of
ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]-IAAP was examined by using
the membrane vesicles from High Five insect cells transfected
with ABCB1 or ABCG2. As showed in Figure 3C and D,
sildenafil dose dependently inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 or ABCG2 with [125I]-IAAP. The 50% inhibition of
the photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP were inhibited by sildenafil at 10 and 100 mmol/L,
respectively. Meanwhile, the ABCB1 inhibitors cyclosporine
A at 10 mmol/L and verapamil at 20 mmol/L inhibited the
[125I]-IAAP photolabeling of ABCB1 up to about 95% and 65%,
respectively, and the ABCG2 inhibitor FTC at 20 mmol/L
suppressed the [125I]-IAAP photolabeling of ABCG2 to about
40% compared with membranes incubated with no inhibitor.
Thus, these data suggest that sildenafil competes with IAAP to
bind both ABCB1 and ABCG2.
Model for binding of sildenafil to ABCB1
Because sildenafil has been described as ABCB1 inhibitor
for the first time, its predicted binding conformation within
the large cavity of the transmembrane region of ABCB1 is
yet to be determined. Because the crystal structure of human

Figure 1. Sildenafil increased the accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel or [3H]-mitoxantrone in the ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cells. The accumulation
of [3H]-paclitaxel (A) or [3H]-mitoxantrone (B, C, and D) was measured after cells were preincubated with or without sildenafil, verapamil, or FTC for 1 hour at
37 C and then incubated with 0.1 mmol/L [3H]-paclitaxel or 0.02 mmol/L [3H]-mitoxantrone for another 2 hours at 37 C. Data points represent the means  SD
of triplicate determinations. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, respectively, for values versus those in the control group. Independent experiments were carried out at least
3 times, and a representative experiment is shown.

ABCB1 is yet to be determined, we sought to develop a homology model of human ABCB1 based on the mouse (Mdr3)
ABCB1-QZ59-RRR cocrystal structure as a template. Human
ABCB1 homology model (Fig. 4A) was then used to dock
sildenafil using Glide docking software to investigate its
potential binding mode. Three binding sites were reported
in the crystal structure of mouse Mdr3 as represented by
ABCB1-QZ59-RRR (site 1), ABCB1-QZ59-SSS (site 2), and
ABCB1-verapamil (site 3; ref. 23). To identify favorable
binding site on ABCB1 for sildenafil, we carried out docking
experiments using these sites. Because our photoaffinity
labeling data suggested that sildenafil displaces IAAP in a
dose-dependent manner, we also docked IAAP to these sites
for comparison. These data also indicated that sildenafil and
IAAP share same binding site on ABCB1 (i.e., site 1). Binding
energy data for the docked poses of sildenafil and IAAP were
compared at each of the binding sites (Supplementary
Table S1). On the basis of binding energy data analysis, both
ligands (sildenafil and IAAP) were found to bind most
favorably within the QZ59-RRR binding site of ABCB1. In
the following section, bound conformation of sildenafil is
discussed in context of site 1.
The XP-Glide–predicted binding mode of sildenafil clearly
shows the importance of hydrophobic interactions within the

3036

Cancer Res; 71(8) April 15, 2011

large drug binding cavity of ABCB1 (Fig. 4B). The N-methylpiperazine (D-ring) of sildenafil was found to be stabilized by
hydrophobic contacts with the side chains of Met69 of transmembrane (TM) 1 and Phe336, Leu339, and Ile340 of TM6. The
C-ring along with ethoxy substituent enters into favorable
hydrophobic interactions with residues Phe72 of TM1, Leu975
and Phe978 of TM12. The A-ring along with its methyl and
propyl substituents and the B-ring forms hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Phe728, Ala729, and Phe732 of
TM7 and Val982 of TM12. In addition to the hydrophobic
contacts, sildenafil also seem to be stabilized by electrostatic
interactions with key residues Tyr953 of TM11 and Tyr307 of
TM5. For example, the sulfonyl oxygen atom enters into a
hydrogen bonding interaction with the hydroxyl group of
Tyr953 (-SO2–HO-Tyr953), whereas the carbonyl oxygen atom

present in the B-ring is located at a distance of 3.9 A from the
side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr307. Transmembrane domain
numbering is according to the reported literature by Aller and
colleagues (23). It may be noted that the binding energy data
for sildenafil (Supplementary Table S1) within each of the
predicted ABCB1 sites is yet to be experimentally validated.
Although docking results are not verified by site-directed
mutagenesis or cocrystal complex of sildenafil–ABCB1; however, in the interim, the binding model of sildenafil within site

Discussion
In this study, we examined the effect of sildenafil on ABCB1-,
ABCC1-, and ABCG2-overexpressing cancer cells. Our data
show that sildenafil has different effects on these 3 ABC
transporters. Cytotoxicity assays showed that sildenafil
potently sensitized ABCB1-overexpressing cells to ABCB1 substrates colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel; mildly sensitized
wild-type or mutant ABCG2-overexpressing cells to the ABCG2
substrates flavopiridol, mitoxantrone, and SN-38. However,
sildenafil had no significant effect on sensitivity of ABCC1overexpressing cells to its substrate vincristine. Furthermore,
sildenafil did not sensitize any of the cells examined to cisplatin
and had no effect on the sensitivity of any of the parental cell
lines. These data suggest that the reversing ability of sildenafil
could be specific to ABCB1 and ABCG2, although sildenafil
appeared to have greater affinity for ABCB1 than for ABCG2.
Consistent with the cytotoxicity data, the results of drug
accumulation studies showed that sildenafil significantly
enhances the intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel in

www.aacrjournals.org

ABCB1-overexpressing cells, and slightly enhances the intracellular accumulation of mitoxantrone and BODIPY-prazosin
in cells overexpressing either wild-type or mutant ABCG2.
These results confirm that sildenafil has a greater affinity
for ABCB1 than for ABCG2. In addition, the results of membrane vesicles transport experiments showed that sildenafil
directly inhibits ABCG2-mediated transport of E217bG and
methotrexate. The results of drug accumulation studies and
membrane vesicles transport study indicate that sildenafil
reduces ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated drug resistance by
directly inhibiting the drug transport function of ABCB1 and
ABCG2. In addition, we also investigated the interaction of
sildenafil with ABCB1 as well as with ABCG2 by using the Visensitive ATPase assay and photoaffinity labeling with [125I]IAAP. Generally, the ATPase activity of ABC transporters is
stimulated in the presence of transport substrates, and the fact
that sildenafil powerfully stimulated the ATPase activity of
ABCB1 and mildly stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCG2
suggests that it might potentially be a substrate of ABCB1 and
ABCG2. Most agents block drug transport by acting as competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors that bind either to drug
interaction sites or to other modulator binding sites, leading to
allosteric changes that prevent outward transport of drugs (26).

Figure 3. Effect of sildenafil on the ATPase activity and [125I]-IAAP photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2. The Vi-sensitive ATPase activity of ABCB1 (A)
and ABCG2 (B) in membrane vesicles was determined with different concentrations of sildenafil as described in the "Materials and Methods" section. Mean
values are given, and the error bars represent standard error from at least 3 independent experiments. The photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 (C) and ABCG2

values versus those in the control group.

Therefore, sildenafil may act as a competitive inhibitor of
ABCB1 and ABCG2 by competing with other drug substrates,
as sildenafil itself may be a substrate. Interestingly, when
[125I]-IAAP was used to photolabel ABCB1 and ABCG2, we
found that sildenafil inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of
ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]-IAAP. This indicates that
sildenafil competes with IAAP to bind to drug substrate
site in both ABCB1 and ABCG2, suggesting further that
sildenafil interacts in the transmemberane regions of both
transporters.
Quantitative structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies
on several ABCB1 inhibitors have clearly indicated the major

3038

Cancer Res; 71(8) April 15, 2011

contribution of lipophilicity toward potent ABCB1 inhibitory
activity (27, 28). This is not surprising considering the fact that
these inhibitors mostly bind to the large hydrophobic cavity
located within the membrane bilayer portion of the ABCB1. In
addition, a number of pharmacophore models for ABCB1
inhibitors have identified features such as hydrophobic,
hydrogen bond acceptor, aromatic ring center, and positive
ionizable groups (29). Importantly, although these properties
are present in several ABCB1 inhibitors, they seem to be only
partially overlapping in the spatial arrangement of the pharmacophoric groups, pointing toward the existence of multiple
binding sites on ABCB1 (30). Interestingly, sildenafil exhibits

all of these pharmacophoric features (hydrophobic, hydrogen
bond acceptor, aromatic ring center, and positive ionizable
groups) and thus can explain its affinity for the large central
hydrophobic cavity of ABCB1. ABCB1 favors positively
charged amphipathic molecules, which suggests the involvement of acidic residues, such as Asp and Glu, in drug binding.
However, analysis of a human ABCB1 homology model did not

reveal the presence of acidic residues in the 8 A sphere around
the docked pose of sildenafil indicating the cationic selectivity
of ABCB1 is not determined by site 1. Among the 1,280
residues, 15 residues represented by Glu74 (TM1), Asp77
(TM1), Glu86 (TM1/EC1), Asp87 (EC1), Asp97 (EC1), Asp100
(TM2), Glu108 (TM2), Glu109 (TM2), Asp110 (TM2), Glu325
(EC3), Asp743 (EC4), Asp744 (EC4), Glu746 (TM8/EC4), Glu972
(EC6/TM12), and Asp973 (TM12) were found to be located
close to the membrane surface, are accessible from within the
site 1, and may provide selectivity for cationic amphipathic
drug molecules through ionic interactions during their entry
into the site 1. Also, these regions are akin to "portals"
described by Aller and colleagues in mouse Mdr3 protein (23).
Sildenafil is a highly selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific
PDE5 and is widely used to treat erectile dysfunction and
pulmonary arterial hypertension. The mechanism of action of
sildenafil involves the protection of cGMP from degradation
by PDE5. Sildenafil acts as a competitive binding agent of
PDE5 with cGMP due to their similar structures, which results
in increased levels of cGMP leading to vascular smooth muscle
relaxation (vasodilation) and increased inflow of blood (31).
However, in this study we did not examine and could not
exclude the effects of sildenafil on the cGMP level. Although

www.aacrjournals.org

the concentrations of sildenafil used in the current study were
a little higher than those found in patients in the clinical
setting and sufficient to block the PDE5 activity (32), we did
not observe any significant effect on the growth and survival of
cells. Up to now, several groups have evaluated the effect of
sildenafil on cancer treatment due to the fact that some
cancers showed higher level of PDE5 activity. It has been
reported that sildenafil induced caspase-dependent apoptosis
of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro (33). Sildenafil
also augmented the endogenous antitumor immunity by
reducing the myeloid-derived suppressor cell function (34).
Black and colleagues reported that sildenafil was able to
increase blood–brain tumor barrier permeability and enhance
efficacy of chemotherapy in a rat brain tumor model (35).
Recently, sildenafil was reported to enhance the sensitivity of
doxorubicin in breast cancer cells, but not exacerbate doxorubicin toxicity to either bone marrow cells or macrophages
(36). While the manuscript was in preparation, Das and
colleagues reported that sildenafil in combination with doxorubicin induced apoptosis by upregulating caspase-3 and
caspase-9 activity, by reducing the phosphorylation of Bad and
expression of Bcl-xL in prostate cancer cells (37). In addition,
the sildenafil–doxorubicin combination reduced the tumor
burden in mice prostate tumor xenograft model (37). Further
study is required to ascertain whether there is expression of
ABC transporters in the Das and colleagues model or, on the
contrary, if apoptotic mechanism is involved in sildenafil
induced sensitization of ABC-transporters needs to be determined. Based on these recent studies and our data, it is
reasonable to suggest that sildenafil may have the potential

to improve the chemotherapeutic outcome of cancer patients,
with possibly several mechanisms of action.
Strategies to develop ABC transporter proteins as a therapeutic target, to inhibit drug efflux and thereby overcome
drug resistance have to date failed in the clinic. Although this
was ascribed in many trials to the use of an inhibitor that was
not potent or the one with marked pharmacokinetic interactions, a number of trials with third-generation agents have
also proven to have negative outcomes. Nonetheless, there is
increasing evidence that ABC transporters are important in
regulating oral bioavailability, pharmacology, and sanctuary
site protection. In pharmacology, single nucleotide variants
that result in impaired protein expression or function have
been shown to associate with higher drug levels or increased
toxicity. The expanding awareness of these proteins in noncancer cells offers the possibility of using knowledge gained in
the development of ABC transporter inhibitors to develop
strategies to improve oral bioavailability or to improve drug
delivery.
In addition, it has been reported that the most common
side effects of sildenafil use included flushing, headache,
dyspepsia, unintentional incomplete sexual arousal, and palpitation (38). Theoretically, by determining the SAR of sildenafil on inhibiting the cGMP hydrolase and ABC transporters,
it is possible to synthesize a better sildenafil analogue, with a
more potent ABC transporter inhibition without affecting the
cGMP hydrolase activity.
In conclusion, the present study shows that sildenafil
inhibits ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated drug efflux, resulting
in an increase in the intracellular concentrations of anticancer
drugs and ensuing drug sensitivity. Further study showed that
sildenafil stimulated the ATPase activity of these 2 pumps and
inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of the transporters with

[125I]-IAAP. Whether sildenafil could contribute to improving
clinical outcome in patients receiving chemotherapy, perhaps
inhibiting drug efflux mediated by ABCB1 and/or ABCG2,
remains to be determined. At a minimum, the study of the
interaction of sildenafil with ABCB1 and ABCG2 presented
herein provides important clues to potential drug–drug interactions, a potential approach to increasing oral drug bioavailability, and a method to increase substrate–drug
accumulation in sanctuary sites.
