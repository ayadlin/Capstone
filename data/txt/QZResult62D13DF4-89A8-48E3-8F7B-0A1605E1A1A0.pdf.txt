ABSTRACT
Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as cetuximab, panitumumab are
one kind of efficacious targeted drugs in treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer
(mCRC). However, only a small proportion of patients harbored wild-KRAS genotype
can benefit from it. We hypothesized that personal genetic heterogeneity might
be the main cause leading to obvious difference in its clinical efficacy. A retrospective
study including 82 mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy plus cetuximab and a
comprehensive meta-analysis containing 2831 cases within sixteen eligible studies
were conducted to investigate the possible association between FCGR2A H131R and
FCGR3A V158F and clinical outcome of mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR mAb
based therapy. Results of the retrospective study showed that H131R within FCGR2A
or V158F within FCGR3A were not associated with clinical outcome in 82 KRAS wild
chemorefractory mCRC patients in co-dominant, dominant, recessive, over-dominant,
allele genetic models. However, the comprehensive meta-analysis with the largest of
sample size obtained the significant result between FCGR3A V158F and PFS (FV/VV vs.
FF: Ph = 0.027, MSR = 0.680, 95%CI = 0.549−0.842 in overall population; Ph = 0.12,
MSR = 0.728, 95%CI = 0.648–0.818 in KRAS wild population) and OS (VV vs. FF:
Ph < 0.001, MSR = 0.733, 95%CI = 0.578−0.930 in overall population). These findings
indicate that KRAS wild chemorefractory mCRC individual harbored genotype FF of
V158Fcan benefit from anti-EGFR mAb adjuvant therapy in terms of PFS and OS, and
it may be useful genetic biomarker to predict clinical survival of mCRC individuals
with anti-EGFR mAb based therapy.

against metastatic CRC (mCRC) have expanded with
the introduction of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor
monoclonal antibody (anti-EGFR mAb) and treatment
outcomes have improved in the past decade [3].
Cetuximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin 1 monoclonal
antibody that targets the extracellular domain of the
EGFR, has been validated to be effective in providing
clinical benefit in wild-KRAS mCRC patients in
combination with chemotherapy as first and second

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common
lethal malignancies in the United States and China [1, 2].
With limitation of useful early diagnostic biomarker and
invasiveness of colonoscopy, most of cases are clinical
confirmed as TNM II-IV patients, and mid-term patients
can benefit from regular surgical operation plus adjuvant
chemoradiotherapy. Meanwhile, the therapeutic options

lines as well as in monotherapy as third line drug [3–7].
However, only approximately 10~20% of patients with
chemorefractory mCRC derived good clinical benefit
from cetuximab therapy [8], revealing that personalized
difference in genetic background might affect individual’s
response and additional mechanisms could lead to CRC
progression [9]. Therefore, an understanding of molecular
basis of clinical response  to cetuximab may be better to
identify the subpopulation of patients who are likely to
benefit from cetuximab and avoid unnecessary drug toxicity
and costs.
The molecular mechanisms underlying response
to cetuximab are still substantially unclear; it is that
cetuximab acts by means of inhibition of EGFR signal
pathway or activation of antibody-dependent cell
cytotoxicity (ADCC) [10]. However, only 30~40% nonresponsive patients harbored KRAS mutation [11, 12],
and some KRAS mutated patients also showed to
respond to cetuximab [13]. These exacting evidences
suggested that ADCC might be involved in cetuximab
enhanced antitumor efficacy [13]. ADCC is stimulated
through the interaction between Fc fragment of lgG1
monoclonal antibodies linked with EGFR of targeted
cancer cell and the surface Fc gamma receptor 2a
and 3a (FCGR2A and FCGR3A) of IgG carried by
immune cells such as natural killer lymphocytes (NK),
macrophages and neutrophil, triggering the activation of
these immune effective cells and leading to the lysis and
death of targeted cancer cell. Genetic variations within
FCGR2A and FCGR3A may contribute to abnormal
secondary spatial structure and function of the products,
leading to different binding affinity to cetuximab.
H131R and V158F are two common single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) which are located in the third
and fifth exon of FCGR2A and FCGR3A, respectively,
and two loci appear to be associated with clinical
outcome in hematological malignancies and breast
cancer with treatment of rituximab and trantuzumab,
respectively [14, 15]. Follicular lymphoma patients
harbored allele V and genotype VV of V158F within
FCGR3A could benefit from the combination therapy
including rituximab [16] and genotype HH of H131R
within FCGR2A was significantly associated with a
shorter event-free survival in breast cancer patients
with sequentially given transtuzumab in UNICANCERPASCO4 trial [17]. Some studies attempted to
investigate the role of the two SNPs in treatment
efficacy of anti-EGFR mAb in advanced CRC patients,
however, these results weren’t in consistence with each
other [18–20].
In this study, we aimed to investigate the
association of FCGR2A H131A and FCGR3A V158F
with clinical outcome of 82 wild-KRAS chemorefractory
mCRC patients undergoing cetuximab adjuvant therapy.
Additionally, a comprehensive meta-analysis including

prospective and retrospective studies was carried out to
confirm the clinical finding.

RESULT
Overall, a total of 46 male and 36 female
chemorefractory mCRC individuals harbored wideKRAS were included in our study. 52 and 30 were colon
and rectal cancer patients, respectively. All of them were
TNM-IV stage patients and treated with chemotherapy
plus cetuximab. However, only 6 CR, 44 PR, 15 SD
and 17  PD were observed in 82 mCRC individuals,
respectively. The genotype distributions of H131R
within FCGR2A and V158F within FCGR3A were in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.52 for FCGR2A, and
P = 0.09 for FCGR3A, respectively) (Table 1).
The influence of the two SNPs on the clinical efficacy
and survival were described in Table 2 and 3. H131R within
FCGR2A weren’t associated with ORR (P = 0.542 for
HR vs. HH; P = 0.357 for RR vs. HH; P = 0.454 for HR/
RR vs. HH; P = 0.598 for RR vs. HH/HR; P = 0.710 for
HR vs. HH/RR; P = 0.409 for R vs. H) and DCR (P = 0.644
for HR vs. HH; P = 0.461 for RR vs. HH; P = 0.559 for
HR/RR vs. HH; P = 0.527 for RR vs. HH/HR; P = 0.787
for HR vs. HH/RR; P = 0.510 for R vs. H) in co-dominant,
dominant, recessive, over-dominant and allele genetic
models, respectively. No statistical significant difference
in response to cetuximab based therapy (P = 0.425 for FV
vs. FF; P = 0.835 for VV vs. FF; P = 0.454 for FV/VV
vs. FF; P = 0.967 for VV vs. FF/FV; P = 0.441 for FV vs.
FF/VV; P = 0.535 for V vs. F) or DCR (P = 0.463 for FV
vs. FF; P = 0.957 for VV vs. FF; P = 0.559 for FV/VV
vs. FF; P = 1.000 for VV vs. FF/FV; P = 0.446 for FV vs.
FF/VV; P = 0.718 for V vs. F) based on FCGR3A V158F
was observed. Also, there was no significant association
between FCGR combined genotype and ORR (P = 0.642
for RR or VV vs. H and F) and DCR (P = 0.554 for RR or
VV vs. H and F) in present study.
The median PFS of cases harbored allele R and H
within H131R of FCGR2A were 6.0 and 6.0 months, and 5.5,
7.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 6.0 months for genotype HH, HR, RR, HR/
RR, HH/HR, HH/RR of FCGR2A, respectively. However,
H131R wasn’t associated with PFS in co-dominant
(HR  =  1.086, 95%CI = 0.636–1.856 for HR  vs.  HH;
HR  =  0.608, 95%CI =  0.203–1.816 for  RR vs. HH),
dominant (HR = 1.02, 95%CI  = 0.608–1.713), recessive
(HR = 0.636, 95%CI = 0.223–1.815),  over-dominant
(HR = 1.162, 95%CI = 0.687–1.964) and allele (HR = 0.989,
95%CI = 0.733–1.333) models. The median OS of cases
carrying H131R genotypes and alleles was 13 months, and
there was no significant difference in OS in  comparison
of HR vs. HH (HR  =  1.332, 95%CI  =  0.765–2.318),
RR vs. HH (HR = 1.341, 95%CI = 0.474–3.797), HR/RR
vs. HH (HR = 1.329, 95%CI = 0.779–2.269), RR vs. HR/

associated with clinical outcome of overall and KRAS
wild chemorefractory mCRC patients in terms of ORR,
DCR in co-dominant, dominant, recessive, over-dominant,
allele models, PFS and OS in co-dominant and dominant
models. No significant difference was observed between
ORR or DCR and genotypes and alleles of V158F,
whatever the KRAS status. However, genotype FV/VV
within V158F of FCGR3A was observed to be significant
associated with a shorter PFS in overall (MSR = 0.680,
95%CI = 0.549–0.842) and KRAS wild population patients
(MSR = 0.728, 95%CI = 0.648–0.818), and individuals
harbored genotype FF showed a longer OS than those
carrying genotype VV of FCGR3A V158F only in overall
population (MSR = 0.733, 95%CI = 0.578–0.930) (Table 5
and Figure 2). There was no significant publication bias in
all comparisons between genotypes of H131R and V158F
and clinical response and outcome, respectively.

predict clinical prognosis of wild-KRAS mCRC patients
with adjuvant treatment of anti-EGFR mAb.
ADCC is considered as an important mechanism for
the antitumor effect of anti-EGFR mAb in mCRC patients
[13, 32]. Cetuximab, an IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, can
bind with EGFR protein of tumor cell by its Fab fragment,
and its Fc fragment engages FCGR on an immune cell
to activate the process of ADCC, eventually resulting in
attacking and eliminating the cetuximab-coated tumor cell.
Alternation of amino acid at specific binding-domain of
Fc fragment of IgG can affected FCGR2A and FCGR3A
binding affinity in vitro and in vivo [33–35]. H131A and
V158F are located at the extracellular ligand-specific
binding domain of FCGR2A and FCGR3A, respectively.
FCGR2A-H allele and FCGR3A-V allele and VV genotype
were associated with higher affinity to lgG2, lgG1 and
lgG3 than others [35–37], respectively. Thus, the two
common polymorphisms within FCGR2A and FCGR3A
affected their receptor’s specific binding-domain of IgG,
leading to different antitumor effect in mCRC patients
with anti-EGFR mAb based therapy.
Several studies concerning FCGR polymorphisms
and efficacy of trantuumab and rituximab demonstrated
that FCGR2A H131R and FCGR3A V158F could predict
clinical efficacy and survival of patients with breast
cancer and lymphoma, respectively [17, 38]. Cohort
study concerned mCRC supported the hypothesis that
FCGR2A H131R and FCGR3A V158F were associated
with clinical outcome of mCRC patients with cetuximab
in a small sample size [30]. Whereas, a large cohort study
containing 1123 chemorefractory mCRC patients failed
to support the significant results [18]. In our retrospective
study, we didn’t observe the significant association
between FCGR2A H131R and FCGR3A V158F and
clinical outcome in chemotherapy plus cetuximab treated
mCRC patients in terms of ORR, DCR, PFS and OS in
retrospective study. Moreover, H131R within FCGR2A
wasn’t associated with ORR, DCR, PFS and OS in
overall and KRAS wild subgroups in the meta-analysis,

DISCUSSION
This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the
first report that combined a retrospective study and a
comprehensive meta-analysis with the largest sample size
for estimating the association between FCGR2A H131R
and FCGR3A V158F and clinical outcome of mCRC
patients with treatment of anti-EGFR mAb based therapy.
With limitation of small sample size, our retrospective
study showed no significant association between FCGR2A
and FCGR3A polymorphisms and clinical outcome in
82 wild-KRAS chemorefractory mCRC individuals treated
with chemotherapy plus cetuximab. However, the robust
results of meta-analysis showed that genotype FF within
V158F was significant associated with a longer PFS and
OS than FV/VV and VV genotype in overall and KRAS
wild population, respectively. These findings suggested
that KRAS wild chemorefractory mCRC individual
harbored genotype FF of V158F could benefit from antiEGFR mAb based therapy in terms of PFS and OS, and
the genotype could be used as a genetic biomarker to

MATERIALS AND METHODS

indicating that the polymorphism of FCGR2A might be
not involved in anti-EGFR mAb induced ADCC effect
and it could not predict clinical outcome of cetuximab
based therapy in wild-KRAS mCRC patients. Nonetheless,
V158F within FCGR3A was significantly associated with
PFS in dominant genetic model in overall and KRAS wild
populations and genotype VV of the loci was significantly
associated with a shorter OS in overall population in the
meta-analysis. These findings suggested that V158F of
FCGR3A was involved in clinical survival of anti-EGFR
mAb treated mCRC individual, and genotype FF could be
used as a prognostic biomarker to predict survival of antiEGFR mAb treated mCRC patients in overall population,
especially KRAS wild carrier. Our finding is in agreement
with previous studies conducted by Zhang et al and Pander
et al [25, 30], respectively, but against our speculation and
inconsistent with the results of other studies [18, 19, 23].
The possible reason why genotype FF of V158F
within FCGR3A was associated a longer PFS and OS
compared with genotype VV and VV/VF remains partly
understand. Included individuals in our retrospective
study and eligible studies in meta-analysis were all
chemorefractory mCRC patients, and long-time’s regular
chemoradiotherapy and increasing burden of CRC leaded
to a gradual decreased immunologic surveillance [18, 26].
NK cell was generally scarce within CRC tumor tissues,
on the contrary, normal level of NK cell was examined
in adjacent normal mucosa [39]. Meanwhile, a significant
reduction in the percentage of NKG2D+NK cell was
observed in peripheral blood of metastatic colon cancer
patients [40]. Additionally, tumor-associated macrophage
(TAM) is one of the most frequently found immune cells
in the tumor microenvironment [41]. Although genotype
VV of V158F displayed a significant higher anti-EGFR
mAb-triggered ADCC in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells in vitro [23]. However, a possible mechanism is that
the high-affinity allele V of V158F within FCGR3A might
contribute to decreased ADCC-triggered by NK cell [18,
26], but through cross-linking of the FCGR to increase
activation of TAM in tumor microenvironment by antiEGFR mAb. Activated TAM releases large amounts of
pro-angiogentic and pro-metastatic regulators to facilitate
angiopoiesis, matrix breakdown, tumor cell motility and
promote tumor growth, leading to poor prognosis [41, 42].
In conclusion, we fail to find the significant
association between FCGR2A H131R and clinical
outcome in KRAS wild mCRC individuals with adjuvant
cetuximab therapy, but KRAS wild chemorefractory
mCRC individual harbored genotype FF of V158F can
benefit from cetuximab based therapy in terms of PFS
and OS, and it may be a prognostic factor to evaluate the
clinical survival of wild-KRAS mCRC patients undergoing
anti-EGFR mAb therapy. With limitation of the study,
multi-central, well designed prospective studies with large
sample size are warrant to further validate our findings.

Patients
Patients with mCRC who diagnosed and treated in
Nanjing First Hospital and Pingxiang People’s Hospital
between 2007 May and 2014 December were enrolled in
our retrospective study. All of them were histologically
proven TNM-IV stage and harbored with wild-KRAS. The
included individuals were treated with cetuximab plus
conventional chemotherapy regimen such as CapeOX,
FOLFIR1 and FOLFOX. Cetuximab was used 400mg/m2
dose at first, then 250mg/m2 subsequently, 21 day a cycle,
and treated until cancer progression or unacceptable
toxicity. This study was approved by the Institution Ethics
Commission of Southeast University, and all included
participants were signed informed consents.

Efficacy evaluation and following-up
In accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria
In Solid Tumors Criteria 1.0 (RECST 1.0), the cancer
response to cetuximab therapy was evaluated every month
at the time of hospitalization and the evaluated results
were defined as complete response (CR), partial response
(PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD),
respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall
survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) and
disease control rate (DCR) were used as endpoints in our
study. PFS and OS were calculated from the first date of
cetuximab usage to the time of disease progression and
death, respectively. Relevant data (sex, age, treatment,
KRAS status, and response evaluated results) were
collected from the cases’ medical records.

PCR amplification and genotyping
Human genomic DNA was extracted from paraffinembedded CRC tissues or EDTA anti-coagulated
peripheral blood samples using TIANamp Genomic DNA
Kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China) and stored at −80°C
till detection. Taqman-genotyping real-time PCR were
selected to detect genotypes of FCGR2A H131R and
FCGR3A V158F using ABI7500 fluorescence quantitative
PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).
The  detail probe, primer sequence, PCR protocol and
detection were in accordance to the study reported by
Norton et al [38].

Meta-analysis
In order to enhance statistical power of the study,
a meta-analysis including all eligible studies was
conducted to further confirm our results. Relevant article
was screened in the Pubmed, Web of SCI and Wanfang
databases in English and Chinese using search terms of

Statistical analysis
The genotype frequencies of FCGR2A H131R and
FCGR3A V158F in all cases were calculated by counting.
Pearson χ2 test was selected to evaluate association
between the loci genotypes and response to cetuximab
based treatment, and P < 0.05 were considered statistically
significance. Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank test and
backward elimination multivariate Cox regression analysis
were used to determine the influence of the FCGR2A
and FCGR3A polymorphisms on PFS and OS, and the
significant P-value was set at 0.05. Q test and estimated
I2 were used to assess the heterogeneity between eligible
studies, and Ph < 0.1 or I2 > 50% was considered as exist
of significant heterogeneity. Overall effect of the metaanalysis was evaluated using Z test in the fixed model
(Ph > 0.1) or the random model (Ph < 0.1) according to
the heterogeneity test and Pz < 0.05 showed a statistical
significance. Begg’s funnel plot was selected to estimate
the possible publication bias, and asymmetric funnel
plot was considered as the existence of publication bias.
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS
statistical 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and Stata 11.0
software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).
