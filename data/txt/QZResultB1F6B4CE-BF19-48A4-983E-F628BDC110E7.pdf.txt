Summary

Author Manuscript

Autophagy, a cellular waste disposal process, has well-established tumor suppressive properties.
New studies indicate that in addition to its cell autonomous anti-tumorigenic functions, autophagy
inhibits cancer development by orchestrating inflammation and immunity. While attenuating
tumor-promoting inflammation, autophagy enhances the processing and presentation of tumor
antigens and thereby stimulates anti-tumor immunity. Although cancer cells can escape
immunosurveillance by tuning down autophagy, certain chemotherapeutic agents with
immunogenic properties may enhance anti-tumor immunity by inducing autophagic cell death.
Understanding the intricate and complex relationships within this troika and how they are affected
by autophagy enhancing drugs should improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Homeostasis and rapid adaptation to environmental changes are key to organismal health
and survival. Autophagy, a “self-eating” process that clears intracellular waste attenuates cell
stress and keeps pro-carcinogenic processes at bay. These tumor suppressive functions of
autophagy are well-recognized and recently reviewed (Mah and Ryan, 2012). While many
previous studies had focused on the cell autonomous nature of autophagy, it has become
clear that autophagy-dependent tumor suppression is also executed through downregulation
of chronic tumor-promoting inflammation and/or enhancement of anti-tumor immunity. By
surveying the relationships between autophagy, inflammation and immunity (the “AII
Troika”) this review aims to explain how they shape the immune landscape that modulates
malignancy. We will discuss how these basic concepts can be translated to improve cancer
immunotherapy.

Although “autophagy” was described in the late 1950’s, its mechanism was elucidated much
later using yeast genetics (Harding et al., 1995; Tsukada and Ohsumi, 1993).
Autophagosome formation requires three main steps: initiation, nucleation and expansion
(Figure 1), which have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (Choi et al., 2013). Autophagy
is classified as microautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy and macroautophagy
(Cuervo and Wong, 2014; Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011). Microautophagy involves
invagination of either lysosomal or endosomal membranes, resulting in direct engulfment of
cytoplasmic cargo. Chaperone-mediated autophagy entails selective degradation of proteins
containing a KFERQ-like motif (Cuervo and Wong, 2014). Macroautophagy consists of
classic double membrane autophagosomes that recognize and sequester cellular cargo that
has been tagged by autophagy adaptors [e.g. sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1), neighbor of
Brca 1 (NBR1) and optineurin] (Stolz et al., 2014). Cargo recognition often depends on
ubiquitylation, but under certain circumstances non-ubiquitinated cargo is also cleared by
autophagy (Zhang and Ney, 2009). Successfully encapsulated cargo is eventually degraded
by lysosomal hydrolases.

Relative to other autophagy types, macroautophagy (hereafter referred as autophagy) is most
important for maintaining homeostasis, because it regulates the turnover and functionality of
key cellular organelles (Levine, 2005; Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011). For instance, tissue
damage and stress cause the release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) that
are sensed by resident tissue macrophages, which mount an acute inflammatory response,
whose goal is to get rid of cell corpses and initiate tissue repair and regeneration (Karin and
Clevers, 2016). However, macrophage overactivation can result in hyperplasia and tumor
promotion. Therefore, the inflammatory response needs to be properly terminated, a task
mediated by autophagy (Gross et al., 2011). DAMP-induced macrophage activation often
involves mitochondrial stress which results in release of mitochondrial signals that affect
secretion of inflammasome-dependent cytokines to fight infections and promote tissue repair
(Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2012). However, uncontrolled macrophage activation results in selfinflicted death, which subsequently triggers extensive neutrophil recruitment, thereby
causing severe immunopathologies. This dangerous process is counteracted by
mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in macrophages (Zhong et al., 2016). In addition,
mitophagy in epithelial and mesenchymal cells is important for preventing mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species (mtROS)-induced tissue damage and tumor initiation (Antonucci et
al., 2015; Chourasia et al., 2015). Moreover, autophagy is required for optimal induction of
protective adaptive immunity (Ma et al., 2013). Hence, in addition to its well-recognized
cell-autonomous anti-tumorigenic properties, autophagy, as outlined below, also controls
important non-cell-autonomous functions that counteract tumorigenesis, mainly through
activation of adaptative immunity and inhibition of chronic inflammation.

Autophagy and Cancer: A Two Way Street
Numerous cancer risk factors (e.g. aging, obesity and chronic inflammation) interfere with
the proper functioning of the autophagic machinery (Figure 1). In epithelial cells, defective
autophagy can promote tumor initiation by enhancing oxidative stress and genomic
instability, as well as by activating transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2related factor 2), which paradoxically induces expression of genes encoding anti-oxidant and

drug metabolizing enzymes (Umemura et al., 2016). Defective autophagy also interferes
with oncogene-induced senescence, an important tumor suppressive mechanism, and thereby
leads to uncontrolled proliferation of cancer progenitor cells (Dou et al., 2015). Conversely,
once the malignant phenotype has been established, autophagy serves as a survival
mechanism that provides rapidly proliferating cancer cells with nutrients (Perera et al.,
2015). Nonetheless, cancers in which autophagy is upregulated, as indicated by
accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) puncta, exhibit
higher density of CD8+ T cells and lower number of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Treg) in the
tumor bed (Ladoire et al., 2016). Thus, enhanced autophagy correlates with activation of
anti-tumor immunity and its downregulation may allow malignant growths to avoid immune
surveillance. Indeed, oncogene activation can inhibit autophagy, in part through a
mechanism similar to one used for inhibition of apoptosis (Degenhardt et al., 2006). Further
complicating the intricate power balance within the “AII Troika”, rapid tumor growth results
in hypoxia and necrosis at the tumor core, leading to DAMP release and recruitment and
activation of macrophages and dendritic cells (Ma et al., 2013). Stimulation of autophagy
may suppress this inflammatory response that drives tumor growth by promoting the
survival of hypoxic and nutrient-starved cancer cells and by clearing damaged mitochondria
(Figures 2 and 3).

Author Manuscript

In addition to cell autonomous modulation of cancer cell physiology, systemic and local
autophagy defects, caused by various cancer risk factors, also affect cancer-associated
inflammation and immune responses (Figures 1 and 2). As described in detail below,
defective autophagy in myeloid cells enhances tumor promoting inflammation while
compromising antigen presentation. Conversely, stimulation of autophagy suppresses tumorpromoting inflammation and enhances anti-cancer immunity (Figure 2). The interaction and
crosstalk between members of the “AII Troika”, their effects on cancer development/
progression and the response to immunotherapy are the focal points for this review.

Corruption of Autophagy by Cancer Risk Factors

Author Manuscript

Age-related, metabolic and environmental factors as well as infectious agents that increase
cancer risk may do so by interfering with the initiation or completion of autophagy (Figure
1). Unlike laboratory-induced ablation of autophagy related genes (ATG) defects, cancer risk
factors do not block autophagy completely, but over time even a partial decrease in
autophagic flux will result in chronic pathologies and elevated cancer risk due to
accumulation of cellular waste. Cancer-causing infectious agents, including Helicobacter
pylori, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated
Herpesvirus (KSHV), have evolved multiple strategies to avoid xenophagic elimination
(Silva and Jung, 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). These pathogens produce bacterial and viral
proteins that bind lysosomes and alter their acidification and ability to degrade
autophagosome-delivered cargo. For instance, H. pylori produces vacuolating cytotoxin A
(VacA) that blocks autolysosome function to promote its own survival and protect the
cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) protein from degradation (Tsugawa et al., 2012).
Stabilized CagA spreads to other host cells, where it activates signaling pathways that
stimulate motility and proliferation and induce gastric mucosal metaplasia (Hayashi et al.,
2013). Although it is not entirely clear how H. pylori promotes gastric cancer development,

CagA-induced changes in the behaviour of gastric epithelial cells and accumulation of p62/
SQSTM1 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the gastric mucosa of patients infected with
virulent VacA-producing strains are thought to be of importance (Tsugawa et al., 2012). In a
similar vein, EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) blocks autophagy by inhibiting lysosome
acidification thereby evading xenophagy, a “selective” form of autophagy that eliminates
cell-invading microbes. Defective autophagy also impairs EBNA1 presentation by major
histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) molecules, an autophagy-dependent process (Paludan
et al., 2005). Furthermore, dysregulation of autophagy results in cytosolic accumulation of
the EBV oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1, LMP1, which activates signaling pathways
that control cell proliferation and survival, and inhibits tumor suppressors (Fathallah et al.,
2010; Zhao et al., 2013). In contrast, HBV, which greatly increases liver cancer risk,
produces the small surface protein (HBs) that triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR),
resulting in stimulation of autophagy (Silva and Jung, 2013). Moreover, another HBV viral
protein, HBx (HBV X protein), binds to class III PI 3-kinase, VPS34, and causes persistent
stimulation of autophagy initiation that promotes HBV core protein maturation (Silva and
Jung, 2013). However, HBx also interacts with V-ATPase and impairs lysosome acidification
and proteolysis (Liu et al., 2014). This results in accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 and viral
proteins in infected hepatocytes, increasing their likelihood to die (Liu et al., 2014).
Enhanced hepatocyte death and subsequent compensatory proliferation strongly enhance
hepatocellular carcinogenesis (Maeda et al., 2005). By activating NRF2, p62 accumulation
protects hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) initiating cells from ROS induced death, allowing
them to accumulate numerous oncogenic mutations (Umemura et al., 2016). Hepatitis C
virus (HCV), on the other hand, induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to interfere with
autophagy (Malhi and Kaufman, 2011). In addition, HCV viral protein NS4B interacts with
VPS34 and Rab5 to inhibit autophagosome maturation and autolysosome formation,
although the precise mechanism remains unknown (Silva and Jung, 2013). Interestingly,
certain viruses encode viral proteins that are homologs of important regulators of autophagy.
For instance, KSHV encoded-protein vFLIP (viral FLICE inhibitory protein) and vBcl-2
(viral B-cell lymphoma 2), that interacts with Atg3 and Beclin1 to block autophagosome
formation or vesicle nucleation, respectively (Silva and Jung, 2013).

Infectious agents that do not produce oncoproteins stimulate cancer development by
inducing chronic tumor promoting inflammation. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), greatly increase the risk of
colorectal cancer (CRC) due to elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6,
TNF and IL-1β (Grivennikov et al., 2010). Autophagy related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1) maps to
a CD susceptibility locus that is associated with an elevated CRC risk (Hampe et al., 2007).
ATG16L1 deficiency afffects the initiation of xenophagy (Maurer et al., 2015), and enhances
expression of Laptm5, a lysosomal transmembrane protein that promotes A20 degradation,
thereby potentiating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and dendritic cell (DC)
activation (Hubbard-Lucey et al., 2014). Due to enhanced inflammasome activity,
ATG16L1-deficient macrophages produce high amounts of IL-1β and IL-18 (Saitoh et al.,
2008), two cytokines known to increase CRC risk. ATG16L1 deficiency also compromises
Paneth cell maturation, resulting in decreased production of antimicrobial peptides (Cadwell
et al., 2008), which together with defective xenophagy contribute to high microbial load in

the lamina propia, which can stimulate CRC development and progression by increasing
IL-23 and IL-17 production (Grivennikov et al., 2012).

Another life threatening inflammatory disease associated with insufficient autophagy is
chronic pancreatitis (Clemens et al., 2014). Chronic pancreatitis greatly increases pancreatic
cancer risk and so do other pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer risk factors, such as alcohol
consumption and high caloric intake, all of which interfere with autophagy activity
(Clemens et al., 2014). Genetic manipulations that attenuate with autophagy lead to chronic
pancreatitis in mice (Antonucci et al., 2015; Li et al., 2013). Alcohol abuse also causes
alcoholic hepatitis (ASH), which is accompanied by lipid doplet accumulation and a marked
increase in HCC risk. Ethanol metabolism interferes with AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) activity, thereby compromising autophagy (You et al., 2004). Moreover, ethanol
metabolism elicits mitochondrial damage, causing ROS production and hepatocyte death
(Louvet and Mathurin, 2015). Dying hepatocytes release DAMP that trigger NOD-like
receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in resident
liver macrophages, resulting in neutrophil infiltration and ASH development (Szabo and
Csak, 2012). Defective myeloid cell autophagy enhances NLRP3 inflammasome activation
thereby augmenting IL-1β production, neutrophil infiltration and liver damage (Zhong et al.,
2016).

Author Manuscript

Obesity causes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can progress to nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH), which increases HCC risk (Starley et al., 2010). Ongoing autophagy
reduces accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes, thus providing a safeguard against
NAFLD and NASH (Schneider and Cuervo, 2014). Conversely, obesity suppresses
autophagy by multiple mechanisms, including activation of calcium-dependent protease
calpain-2 that leads to ATG7 degradation (Yang et al., 2010), activation of mammalian target
of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and inhibition of unc-51 like autophagy activating
kinase 1 (ULK1) activity (Tremblay et al., 2005) or defective autophagosome-lysosome
fusion, due to changes in membrane lipid composition and ER stress (Yang et al., 2010).
Obesity also compromises macrophage autophagy (Liu et al., 2015), which can result in
enhanced IL-1β and IL-18 production (Zhong et al., 2016). Consistent with this notion,
myeloid specific Atg5 ablation greatly increases the likelihood of NASH development upon
consumption of high fat diet (Liu et al., 2015). Steatotic hepatocytes release linoleic acid
that causes depletion of liver resident CD4+ T cells, thereby contributing to the dismanteling
of antitumor immunity (Ma et al., 2016).

The ultimate cancer risk factor is old age, which has a detrimental effect on autophagy
(Martinez-Lopez et al., 2015). Defective autophagy in aged individuals or animals results in
aberrant clearance of damaged mitochondria, leading to elevated inflammation and
accumulation of ROS and protein aggregates that cause ER stress (Bujak et al., 2015;
Komatsu et al., 2006). These cellular defects contribute to different degenerative diseases
and enhance tumor initiation and malignant progression (Martinez-Lopez et al., 2015).
Aging is accompanied by indolent inflammation and parainflammation manifested by
increased basal production of IL-1β, IL-18, TNF and IL-6. (Chung et al., 2009; Licastro et
al., 2005). All of these cytokines enhance cancer development and progression (Grivennikov

et al., 2010). Chronic inflammation also compromises anti-cancer immunity (Shalapour and
Karin, 2015).

Autophagy turns off the inflammatory fire
In addition to xenophagy that reduces tumor promoting inflammation by eliminating
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-producing intracellular microbes, other
forms of autophagy also suppress tumor-promoting inflammation. In addition to increasing
cancer risk, sustained and/or unresolved inflammation causes collateral tissue damage, doing
more harm than good. Conversely, a properly mounted, focused and transient inflammation
promotes tissue repair and regeneration (Karin and Clevers, 2016). As discussed below,
autophagy ensures a well-balanced inflammatory response that is accompanied by
restoration of homeostasis.

The ability of autophagy to prevent excesive inflammation was first observed in mice
rendered deficient in Atg16l1, which produce significantly more IL-1β than wild-type (WT)
controls and are more vulnerable to septic shock (Saitoh et al., 2008). Further studies
demonstrated that anything that blocks autophagy, be it Atg gene ablation or
pharmacological intervention, results in enhanced caspase-1 activation and increased IL-1β
production and secretion (Nakahira et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011). Caspase-1 is activated
after its incorporation into large protein assemblies called inflammasomes, which also
contain a sensor protein that belongs to the NLR (Nod-like receptor) family and the adaptor
protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like). Production of biologically active IL-1β, one
of the two most potent inflammatory cytokines (the other being TNF), depends on two steps.
First, IL-1β gene transcription is induced upon NF-κB activation caused by PAMP or DAMP
binding to Toll-like receptors (TLR) or engagement of TNF receptors. Translation of IL-1β
mRNA results in production of precursor pro-IL-1β, which cannot be secreted by
macrophages. The second step is inflammasome dependent and is initiated by NLR-specific
stimuli (Martinon et al., 2009). For instance, NLRC4 (NLR family CARD domaincontaining protein 4) senses cytosolic flagelin, whereas NLRP1b (NLR Family, Pyrin
Domain Containing 1) detects anthrax lethal toxin. The sensor protein with the broadest
sensitivity is NLRP3, which responds to a panoply of stimuli including ATP, toxins (e.g.
nigericin), uric acid, cholesterol, alum, silica and asbestos microcrystals and lipid particles.
Notably, none of these stimuli is directly recognized by NLRP3. Instead they either open
potassium channel(s), disrupt membrane integrity or function through other indirect
mechanisms that somehow culminate in mitochondria damage (Elliott and Sutterwala,
2015). Damaged mitochondria release or present substances such as mtROS, oxidized
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or cardiolipin, which are presumed to be direct NLRP3
inflammasome activators (Elliott and Sutterwala, 2015). Although the identity of the
ultimate NLRP3 ligand and how it activates the inflammasome remains to be determined, it
is quite well established that macrophages encountering NLRP3 activating stimuli display
mitochondrial damage and that elimination of mitochondria or mtROS specifically prevents
NLRP3 inflammasome activation and production of mature IL-1β and IL-18 (Zhong et al.,
2016; Zhou et al., 2011) (Figure 3).

Given its dependence on mitochondrial damage, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is
negatively regulated by autophagy which keeps IL-1β and IL-18 production and subsequent
inflammation in check (Nakahira et al., 2011; Zhong et al., 2016). Mitochondria that have
been damaged upon macrophage encounter with NLRP3 activating stimuli, undergo Parkindependent ubiquitylation, followed by recruitment of the ubiquitin-binding autophagy
adaptor p62/SQSTM1 (Figure 3). By recognizing LC3 on phagophore membranes, p62
ensures the mitophagic elimination of damaged mitochondria and termination of NLRP3
inflammasome activation (Zhong et al., 2016). Of note, p62 gene transcription is induced by
NF-κB, the same process that controls the first step in IL-1β production and accounts for
upregulation of NLRP3 itself. Genetic ablation of p62 or inhibition of IκB kinase β (IKKβ),
which attenuates p62 induction, results in excessive secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 by
macrophages that have been presented with NLRP3 activating stimuli, despite the
concomitant decrease in Il1b gene transcription (Greten et al., 2007; Zhong et al., 2016).
Enhanced IL-1β secretion results in excessive inflammation and neutrophilia (Greten et al.,
2007; Hsu et al., 2011; Zhong et al., 2016). Of note, the NLRP3 inflammasome likely plays
an important and rather general role in the onset of tumor promoting inflammation, as it is
activated by carcinogenic asbestos and silica microparticles (Dostert et al., 2008), as well as
by lipids and cholesterol, which stimulate NAFLD progression to NASH and thereby
increase HCC risk.

Another mechanism through which autophagy squelches the tumor-promoting inflammatory
fire is xenophagy. For instance, following infection of phagocytes with H. pylori,
Salmonella, Listeria or Shigella, PAMP recognition by TLR and NLR stimulates xenophagy,
which by reducing pathogen load attenuates microbe-induced inflammation (Levine, 2005).
Like damaged mitochondria, intracellular bacteria are recognized by autophagy receptors
such as p62, NBR1 and NDP52, which promote their autophagic clearance (Manzanillo et
al., 2013). One trigger of xenophagy could be energy imbalance, caused by competition
between the invading microorganism and the host cell for nutrients, which results in AMPK
activation and inhibition of mTORC1, stimulating the initiation of autophagy through
modulation of ULK1/2 phosphorylation (Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011). Intriguingly,
xenophagy and mitophagy are evolutionarily related as mitochondria are thought to have
originated from endosymbiotic bacteria (Randow and Youle, 2014). Thus the control of
inflammation, by either exogenous or endogenous insults may be an ancient function of
autophagy in multicellular organisms. Given the importance of inflammation in tumor
development (Grivennikov et al., 2010), there is little doubt that the anti-inflammatory
function of autophagy makes a key contribution to its tumor suppressive ability.

Autophagy as an immune stimulator
Adaptive immunity relies on recognition of extracellular (exogenous) or intracellular
(endogenous) peptide epitopes presented by MHC class II and I molecules that are
recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, repectively (Shibutani et al., 2015). Autophagy in
antigen-presenting cells (APC) can promote antigen presentation by both MHC class II and I
molecules. For instance, upon uptake of extracellular antigens (e.g. microbial or tumor
antigens) by APC, autophagy promotes trafficking of the engulfed antigens to endosomes,
where they are digested by cathepsins and loaded onto MHC class II molecules that

eventually translocate to the plasma membrane and present antigens to CD4+ T cells.
Although the precise mechanism remains to be further investgated, autophagy also facilitates
“cross-presentation” of exogenous constituents by facilitating their loading onto MHC class
I molecules that ultimately activate antigen specific CD8+ T cells. Notably, autophagymediated cross-presentation is important for mounting T cell responses under various
stressed conditions, when proteasome function is compromised and antigenic peptides
cannot be imported to the ER for loading onto MHC class I molecules. In support of this
notion, in tumor-bearing mice or cancer patients, tumor infiltrating APC found in the
draining lymph nodes are often functionally compromised. To ensure the generation of an
effective antitumor cytotoxic T cells (CTL) response, APC autophagy then becomes of
utmost importance and needs to be stimulated to facilitate processing and cross-presentation
of tumor antigenic peptides by MHC class I molecules (Ma et al., 2013; Shibutani et al.,
2015). Furthermore, autophagy also induces upregulation of MHC class I molecules in
response to IFN-γ (Li et al., 2010), further enhancing the “cross-presentation” of
extracellular antigens (Shibutani et al., 2015). Last but not least, in addition to its roles in
APC, autophagy in cancer cells can indirectly promote “cross-presentation” of tumor
antigens by facilitating their release from dying cells, thereby increasing extracellular
antigen availability (Ma et al., 2013).

Author Manuscript

Autophagy also stimulates thymic “negative selection” of autoreactive CD4+ T cells, thereby
maintaining central T cell tolerance (Aichinger et al., 2013; Schmid et al., 2007). Autophagy
further regulates lymphocyte development and functional diversification. Naïve T cell
number is dramatically reduced in the absence of mitophagy, and mature T cells require
autophagy for survival (Pua et al., 2007). Additionally, autophagy indirectly influences Th17
cell polarization by restraining IL-1β production by innate immune cells. Since IL-1β
promotes Th17 lineage commitment together with IL-6 and TGFβ (Zhou and Littman,
2009), defective autophagy should enhance IL-17 production and tumorigenesis
(Grivennikov et al., 2012). As mentioned above, defective hepatocyte autophagy results in
accumulation of lipid doplets, which may promote the release of linoleic acid, causing the
depletion of hepatic CD4+ T cells and creating an immunosuporessive microenvironment
that promotes cancer growth (Ma et al., 2016). The generation of T cell-dependent and –
independent antibody responses also requires functional autophagy as its absence results in
ER stress and consequent plasma cell death (Pengo et al., 2013). In summary, autophagy
tunes down inflammation while boosting adaptive immunity capable of curtailing tumor
growth and progression.

Autophagy and its split personality: modulation of immunotherapy
Author Manuscript

Concomitant with the improved understanding of tumor biology and immunology, great
progress has been made towards development of immunological therapies for cancer. Cancer
immunotherapies include vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expressing T cells,
bispecific antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (Sharma and Allison, 2015). Byand-large, all of these strategies unleash the killing power of T cells and focus it on
malignant cells. Nonetheless, cancer cells often adopt various ways to evade immune
destruction, an ability that is critical for tumor progression (Figure 2). In addition to MHC
downregulation, common immune escape mechanisms include recruitment and expansion of

Foxp3+ Treg cells and induction of T cell anergy or exhaustion through direct and indirect
interactions between cancer cells and infiltrating T cells (Sharma and Allison, 2015).
Fortunately, a better understanding in tumor immunology has led to effective strategies for
overcoming some of these immune escape mechanisms. Especially important were the
discoveries of cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed
death 1 (PD-1), which are inhibitory receptors expressed by activated T cells (Ishida et al.,
1992; Krummel and Allison, 1995). CTLA-4 competes with the CD28 co-stimulatory
receptor for binding B7 molecules on APC, but unlike CD28 which acts positively, CTLA-4
engagement generates a regulatory signal that inhibits T cell proliferation and causes cell
death (Krummel and Allison, 1995). CTLA-4 blockade relieves this negative input and
potentiates antigen-mediated activation of T cells, including T cells directed against tumor
antigens but also autoreactive T cells (Sharma and Allison, 2015). PD-1 is engaged by two
ligands appropriately called PD-1 ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) that are expressed by
different cell types, including cancer cells, myeloid cells and immunosuppressive
plasmocytes (Shalapour et al., 2015). PD-1 engagement switches activated CD8+ T cells to
an exhausted phenotype, characterized by expression of specific markers and inability to
mount a CTL response (Freeman et al., 2000). Correspondingly, PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade
allows activation of CTL responses, including those that are directed against tumor antigens
(Dong et al., 2002). Although checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 or PD-1 are highly
effective in treatment of metastatic cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and
renal cell carcinoma, quite a few cancer types have not shown a significant response when
treated with such drugs as monotherapies (Sharma and Allison, 2015). Even in melanoma,
an immunogenic cancer that is highly responsive to checkpoint inhibitors, only a fraction of
patients, usually not exceeding 50%, show a complete response to a single agent. The causes
of treatment failure are not clear, but it has been suggested that insufficient release or
presentation of tumor antigens is a major factor (Sharma and Allison, 2015). One way to
overcome this limitation is to combine checkpoint inhibitors with inducers of so-called
immunogenic cell death (ICD), a unique response that is thought to depend on autophagy
(Bezu et al., 2015) (Figure 4).

Author Manuscript

Unlike immunologically silent or even tolerogenic apoptosis, ICD is a non-silent form of
cell death that results in immune system activation. In cancer cells, ICD is postulated to
induce the release of tumor antigens which are taken up and processed by APC, ultimately
resulting in a tumor eradicating CTL response (Kroemer et al., 2013). Of note, a number of
conventional cancer therapeutic agents/strategies are capable of inducing cancer cell ICD.
These include anthracyclines (i.e., doxorubicin, epirubicin, and idarubicin), mitoxantrone,
oxaliplatin and cyclophosphamide, especially when used at a low non-myeloablative dose
(Kroemer et al., 2013). Radiotherapy also induces ICD, resulting in CTL activation and
systemic tumor rejection, even in mice bearing multiple tumors in which only a single tumor
has been irradiated (Twyman-Saint Victor et al., 2015). Certain oncolytic viruses (e.g.
Coxsackievirus B3, Parvovirus and Herpes simplex virus) are also potent ICD inducers
(Kaufman et al., 2015). Although their mechanism of action is not entirely clear, ICD
inducers were suggested to trigger ER stress in cancer cells, causing pre-apoptotic

activation of pro-apoptotic molecules, including caspase-8, BAX (BCL2-associated X
protein) and BAK1 (BCL2 antagonist/killer 1), and activation of intracellular vesicular
trafficking (Kepp et al., 2014). Surface exposed calreticulin is one of the three main DAMP
produced by dying cancer cells along with ATP and high mobility group box 1 protein
(HMGB1). By binding CD91, calreticulin generates an “eat-me” signal that triggers the
uptake of dying cancer cells by recruited phagocytes, leading to CTL activation in the tumor
bed (Basu et al., 2001). Other DAMP, such as heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70) and 90
(HSP90), further enhance APC maturation and antigen cross-presentation (Krysko et al.,
2012)(Figure 4).

ICD also results in ATP release, a process considered to depend on activation of autophagy.
Extracellular ATP functions as a “find-me” signal that by engaging the purinergic receptor
P2Y2 recruits monocytes that upon maturation into macrophages/DCs engulf dying cancer
cells. By binding a related purinergic receptor, ligand-gated ion channel 7 (P2X7),
extracellular ATP activates the NLRP3 inflammasome to induce IL-1β secretion, a process
critical for a successful CTL response (Ghiringhelli et al., 2009). Of note, the preferential
engagement of distinct purinergic receptors depends on ATP concentration: at <1 uM ATP
predominantly binds P2Y2 to induce monocyte infiltration; whereas at > 100 uM it engages
P2X7 to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (Krysko et al., 2012). Last but not least,
HMGB1 is also required for ICD induction by chemotherapeutic agents and subsequent
activation of anti-tumor immunity as shown in colorectal cancer (Apetoh et al., 2007).
HMGB1 released from cancer cells undergoing ICD is thought to engage TLR4 on APC,
resulting in enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration, which in combination with immune
checkpoint inhibitors, leads to a strong antitumor response (Pfirschke et al., 2016). In
addition, HMGB1-TLR4 signaling can prime the NLRP3 inflammasome, which further
enhances induction of an antitumor CTL response (Ghiringhelli et al., 2009).

Autophagy plays a key role in promoting release of DAMP and antigens. Hence, stimulation
of cancer cell autophagy is an important requisite for ICD (Martins et al., 2014). During
ICD, intact autophagosomes, loaded with multiple tumor antigens, HSP and DAMP, are
released to the extracellular space to be taken up by APC, inducing their maturation,
activation and antigen cross-presentation (Ma et al., 2013). In support of this notion, ablation
of autophagy genes (ATG5, ATG7, and BECN1) inhibited DAMP release from cancer cells
killed by mitoxanthrone or oxaliplatin, and subsequently attenuated induction of anti-tumor
immunity (Martins et al., 2012; Michaud et al., 2011). It was also suggested that cisplatin,
which can induce apoptosis as effectively as oxaliplatin, does not trigger ICD because it
does not stimulate autophagy in prostate cancer cells (Shalapour et al., 2015). Autophagy
also controls exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), another “eat-me” signal that promotes
uptake of cancer cell corpses and subsequent presentation of tumor antigens (Ma et al.,
2013). However, the precise molecular mechanism that drives autophagy-dependent DAMP
and antigen release remains largely unknown. It is also unknown why only certain
chemotherapeutic agents can trigger ICD.

Recruiting autophagy to enhance cancer immunotherapy
As discussed above, autophagy is tumor suppressive during early tumorigenesis, but its role
in advanced cancer remains controversial. It was suggested that survival of established
cancers depends on autophagy and therefore autophagy inhibitors should be useful as cancer
therapeutics (White, 2015). However, an extensive examination of this proposal, using a
large number of human cancer cell lines, failed to detect regression of tumor xenografts on
inhibition of autophagy (Eng et al., 2016). Although the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine
inhibited growth of some cancer cell lines, its effect was autophagy-independent.

Conversely, since autophagy mediates the release of tumor antigens and DAMP, it appears
that downregulation of autophagy will allow advanced tumors to escape
immunosurveillance. Indeed, tumors that retained elevated autophagic flux contain more
CD8+ T cells than low autophagy tumors (Ladoire et al., 2016). Given these findings, it
seems that the concept of treating cancer with autophagy inhibitors is ill conceived and
likely to result in immune escape and accelerated progression of premalignant lesions and
early tumors. Thus, rather than inhibit cancer cell autophagy, we should consider stimulating
it, in order to enhance anti-tumor immunity. However, the direct manipulation of autophagy
is not an easy task, as most autophagy enhancers do not target the autophagy machinery
directly or selectively and may affect multiple targets. Indirect autophagy activators include
agents that inhibit energy generation and metabolic pathways, including caloric restriction
mimetics (e.g. blockers of cytosolic acetyl coenzyme A), inhibitors of autophagy-repressive
acetyltransferases and activators of autophagy-stimulatory deacetylases, metformin and
related biguanides (weak inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and AMPK activators), and
rapalogs (inhibitors of mTORC1, a negative regulator of autophagy initiation). Many of
these agents exhibit anti-aging and anti-tumor properties (Bhullar and Hubbard, 2015; Foretz
et al., 2014; Lamming et al., 2013; Morselli et al., 2010). Given that cancer is an age-related
disease, it is not surprising that dietary or pharmacological caloric restriction, which extends
lifespan, can enhance antitumor immunity and delay cancer development (Pietrocola et al.,
2016). But whether such treatments alone will affect established malignancies is
questionable. To achieve significant therapeutic efficacy, caloric restriction or starvation
mimetics should be considered in combination with immunogenic chemotherapeutics
capable of inducing ICD. It is also important that starvation mimetics will not exert any
immunosuppressive effects that are typical of rapamycin and similar agents. In addition,
ICD inducers need to be used at low, non myelosuppressive doses and their combination
with starvation mimetics should not augment immunosuppression. Another potential
complication associated with autophagy enhancers is the ability of autophagy to attenuate
activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by DAMP released upon ICD induction. Since
IL-1β is required for ICD-mediated DC maturation and antigen presentation (Ghiringhelli et
al., 2009), inhibition of its production could be counterproductive. One way to circumvent
this problem is to combine autophagy inducers with inhibitors of p62 induction, such as
IKKβ antagonists (Zhong et al., 2016). IKKβ inhibitors have the added benefit of sensitizing
cancer cells to chemotherapy- or radiation-induced cell death. Future studies should be
directed at studying the effect of such drug combinations on anti-tumor immunity and its
stimulation by checkpoint inhibitors.

Autophagy is also critical for mounting antigen-specific T cell responses (Bezu et al., 2015).
But again, the effect of autophagy enhancement on T cell mediated immune responses is
complex, even in the context of cancer vaccines. Most vaccines rely on adjuvants, such as
alum and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), which were proposed to exert their
immunomostimulatory effect through NLRP3-inflammasome activation (Eisenbarth et al.,
2008; Li et al., 2008), which is attenuated by autophagy (Zhong et al., 2016). Thus, systemic
use of autophagy enhancers may reduce the efficacy of cancer vaccines, unless combined
with agents that inhibit p62 induction. Alternatively, autophagy inducers should be delivered
directly and specifically into cancer cells, perhaps as antibody-drug conjugates or ligandcoated nanoparticles.

Concluding Remarks
Author Manuscript

Autopahgy is a key tumor suppressive process and many of its effects are exerted in a cell
non-autonomous manner through inhibition of tumor-promoting inflammation and activation
of anti-tumor immunity. As our appreciation and understanding of cancer-related autophagy
grow, it is time to start putting basic knowledge into practice. We propose that, together with
immunogenic chemotherapeutics and immune checkpoint blockade, autophagy enhancers
should expand the pharmacological arsenal and augment the efficacy of cancer
immunotherapy.

Figure 3. Mitophagy/Autophagy Dials Down Inflammation

Stimulation of macrophages with DAMP (e.g. ATP and uric acid), carcinogenic particles
(asbestos and silica microfibers/crystals) or PAMP (e.g. bacterial toxins) results in
mitochondrial damage that is characterized by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and
subsequent release of mtDNA and mtROS. These mitochondrial signals in turn activate the
NLRP3 inflammasome to induce IL-1β and IL-18 secretion. Loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential (ψm) activates PINK1, a mitochondrial protein kinase that
phosphorylates ubiquitin chains attached to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins.

Author Manuscript

Phosphorylated ubiquitin interacts with and activates Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that
further ubiquitinates mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Ubiquitin-tagged mitochondria
are recognized by the UBA domain of p62, whose expression is induced upon NF-κB
activation. p62 also binds to LC3 and targets ubiquitinated mitochondria to autophagosomal
clearance. By eliminating signal-emitting mitochondria, macrophage limits the extent of
NLRP3-inflammasome activation. MSU, monosodium urate crystal; PINK1, PTEN-induced
putative kinase 1; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3; NF-κB, nuclear
factor-kappa B; UBA, ubiquitin association domain.

Figure 4. Autophagy Fuels Immunogenic Cell Death

Author Manuscript

Overview of the roles of autophagy in ICD. Ionizing radiation, oncolytic viruses and certain
chemotherapeutic agents induce autophagy-dependent release of DAMP and tumor antigens
by cancer cells. DAMP lead to maturation and advanced activation of APC, which after
engulfing tumor antigens, use autophagy to process antigens and cross-present them to T
cells, leading to activation of CTL survival and maturation are also stimulated by autophagy.
CTL activation can be limited upon engagement of the inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and
PD-1 by ligands that are present within the tumor bed. Immune checkpoints inhibitors
overcome this inhibition and promote effective CTL-mediated tumor eradication, especially
when combined with ICD inducers. HSP70/90, heat shock protein 70/90; HMGB1, high
mobility group box 1 protein; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation endproducts; P2X7,
purinergic receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel 7; TLR2/4, toll-like receptor 2/4; CTL,
