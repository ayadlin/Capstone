n international study under the guidance of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and
the National Cancer Institute of Canada caused a furor in 2005.
Patients with glioblastoma who had received temozolomide (TMZ)
during and after radiotherapy lived significantly longer than those
who had received radiotherapy alone. The news was covered widely
by the media as a breakthrough in brain tumor research. Today, the
application of TMZ concomitantly with radiotherapy and thereafter
is considered the new treatment standard for this aggressive brain
tumor. A phase 3 trial performed by the Neuro-Oncology working
Group of the German Cancer Society (NOA) that yielded better survival data than any prior phase 3 study for glioblastomas had been
published 2 years before. Radiochemotherapy either with nimustine
(ACNU) and teniposide or with ACNU plus cytarabine yielded median survival and 2-year survival rates at least equal to those of the
EORTC trial. The drugs cost much less than TMZ. However,
although the study results were published in a high-ranking medical
journal as well, they received much less publicity, and none of the
NOA protocols has become generally accepted. After comparing the
2 studies in detail, as well, the author of this report suggests conducting a new phase 3 trial comparing the 2 regimens to determine
whether TMZ is justified further as standard for the treatment of
glioblastoma.
In 2003, the Neuro-Oncology Working Group of the German
Cancer Society (NOA) published a randomized study (NOA-1) in
patients with malignant glioma.1 It compared 2 radiochemotherapy
combinations of nimustine (ACNU) with either teniposide (VM26)
or cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). The median survival and the 2-year
survival rates for both arms were approximately equal but exceeded
those from all prior phase 3 studies. Nevertheless, the results from
that study have remained widely unnoticed.
Two years later, the European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the National Cancer Institute of
Canada (NCIC) published a study in which temozolomide (TMZ)
during and after irradiation was compared with radiotherapy only.2
The outcome of the treatment arm was similar to the outcome
reported in the NOA-1 trial. In contrast to the German study, this

result was communicated widely in the scientific and
lay press. In the meantime, the TMZ regimen has
become the new standard for glioblastoma (GB)
treatment.
It can only be speculated why NOA-1 was
ignored. Maybe the large number of previously
unsuccessful studies with other chloroethylnitrosoureas (CENUs) played a role. Or perhaps it was
the radiotherapy-only arm of the EORTC study,
which demonstrated the TMZ effect more convincingly. The NOA-1 trial did not include one,
because, when the trial was initiated in Germany,
it was no longer considered ethically justifiable
to have a radiotherapy-only arm for malignant
gliomas.1 The objective of this commentary was to
recall these important results, especially because
the NOA-1 treatment regimen appears to be very
cost effective.

RESULTS
NOA-1 Study
The NOA-1 trial compared 2 radiochemotherapy
arms. In total, 362 patients with GB or anaplastic
astrocytoma (AA) received radiotherapy and up to
5 cycles of either ACNU plus VM26 or ACNU plus
ara-C combination chemotherapy.1 Both treatment
alternatives were proven equally effective. With a
median survival of 16 to 17 months, the GB patients
lived considerably longer than after other forms of
chemotherapy. Also, the 2-year survival rates (25%
and 29%) exceeded those of all prior phase 3 studies
(Table 1).

EORTC Study 26981
In total, 573 patients with glioma were recruited at
85 European and North American centers. All
patients received radiotherapy, and 50% received
TMZ during and after the irradiation phase (Table 1).
The median survival of this group was 2.5 months
longer (14.6 months vs 12.1 months) and their 2-year
survival rate was higher by a factor of 2.5 (26.5% vs
10.4%) compared with the control group that
received radiotherapy only.
Table 2 lists survival data from the NOA-1 and
EORTC 26981 trials arranged according to various
single variables (performance index, age, extent of
surgery), as well as to Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG) risk groups (data from previous
reports1-3). The drug costs for a typical treatment period, consisting of 5 or 6 cycles of the 3 different
schemes, are provided in Table 3.

DISCUSSION

Careful reading of the original EORTC publication2
reveals a weakness that has remained unnoticed even
in a subsequent report by the study group.3 The title
and abstract in the original article refer to patients
with newly diagnosed GB only. However, only 85% of
the tumors were reviewed centrally; and, among
these, 3% were diagnosed as AA, 3% were diagnosed
as other histologies, and 1% were deemed ‘inconclusive material.’
Patients who have other tumor entities must not
be combined with the GB group, because they have
another, often better prognosis.4-6 The NOA-1 data in
Table 1 illustrate that patients with AA patients, on
average, live 3 to 4 times longer than patients with
GB. Hence, every patient with AA who is erroneously
assigned to the GB group increases the probability
that the calculated survival is falsely extended.
If the AA patients in treatment arm I (ACNU plus
VM26) or treatment arm II (ACNU plus ara-C) are
grouped together with the GB patients, then the median survival increases by nearly 2 months, and the 2year survival increases by up to 12 percentage points
to an impressive 37%. In the EORTC study, the bias
should not be as dramatic. Nevertheless, even a fraction of only 3% of AA patients can increase the median survival by a couple of weeks and the 2-year
survival rate by 1 or 2 percentage points.7
Table 2 lists survival data from the NOA-1 and
EORTC 26981 trials arranged according to various
subgroups. The results sorted by performance index,
age, and extent of surgery are influenced by the fraction of AA patients. This translates into a possibly
overstated benefit for the NOA-1 treatment arms.
However, the situation is different for the RTOG
risk groups, which classify patient populations with
malignant glioma according to multiple prognostic
variables, including histology. This yields refined
patient subsets that are particularly suited for a direct
comparison of different treatment regimens.4,5 From
Table 2, it is obvious that the NOA-1 trial was more
favorable than the EORTC 26981 trial when the results
are arranged according to these stratification criteria.
New treatment protocols are assessed not only
for prolongation of life. Equally important is whether
the protocols are tolerated well by the patients and
that they have acceptable side effects. The combination of ACNU and ara-C was associated with significantly more toxicity than ACNU and VM26, and the
latter combination caused leukopenia slightly more
often than the TMZ regimen (Table 1). However,
NOA-1 was designed for dose escalation where possible and deliberately accepted more side effects. In
fact, 40% of patients in the ACNU plus VM26 arm

had their ACNU doses escalated, but only 6% needed
reductions. The side effects did not cause more treatment discontinuations among patients in the NOA-1
trial (Table 1). With 11% and 13%, respectively, they
were in the same range as in the EORTC trial (13%).
Finally, Table 1 also illustrates that the number of
uncontrollable serious incidents was similar for the 3
chemotherapy arms.
At first sight, the competitive outcome of the
NOA study may be surprising, given the many less
favorable survival data from other, earlier CENU
trials. However, contrary to what often has been
depicted, CENUs have demonstrated different effectiveness and selectivity in vitro and in vivo.
For example, ACNU is less toxic to the lung than
carmustine.8 This is the major reason why ACNU is
preferred in Japan and in some European countries.
In vitro experiments tend to explain this difference
by illustrating the different selectivity of the various
CENUs toward O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-expressing cells. ACNU is considered
more discriminating than carmustine and lomustine
(CCNU). Mucous producing Clara cells, which supposedly are very low in MGMT activity,9 are spared
better by ACNU than by the other agents.
Among solid tumors, brain tumors also are considered low-expressing MGMT tumors. Therefore, it
was predicted that ACNU would be more effective
than other CENUs in conveying a therapeutic
response with less nonspecific toxicity.10 This prediction was confirmed in a recent report. A survival gain
analysis of 24,000 patients with high-grade glioma
who were treated with various CENUs demonstrated
the greatest gain in survival for ACNU-treated
patients (þ8.9 months). CCNU yielded a survival gain
of þ5.9 months, and, for carmustine—the most
widely used CENU—no gain was discernable.11
Effectiveness and toxicity, at least for ACNU and
VM26, seem comparable to those for TMZ. However,
the differences in cost between the study medications are tremendous.
During the first cycle of the EORTC protocol,
TMZ has to be administered daily. This causes drug
costs of approximately 7600 Euros (Table 3). In the
adjuvant phase, the drug needs to be taken for 5
days per cycle only, although at higher doses. This
results in costs ranging from 1400 to 2000 Euros per
additional cycle. The same patient treated with 1 of
the NOA-1 schemes would require cytostatic drugs
for costs of only 300 or 400 Euros per cycle.
The cost for the whole treatment period amounts
to approximately 17,000 Euros for TMZ, roughly 2000
Euros for ACNU plus VM26, and only 1500 Euros for
ACNU plus ara-C. Even considering the additional

2621

charges to administer VM26 or ara-C as infusions
(100 Euros per application), the cost for TMZ
remains a multiple of the cost of the other drugs.
Severe emesis was rare in the NOA study (grade 3 or
4 events on <1.5% of study days) and did not result
in significant extra cost.
Wasserfallen et al12 calculated similar values for
the drug cost. They estimated that the total cost of
care for the treatment of a GB patient with TMZ was
approximately 34,000 Euros with 55% of that cost attributable to the acquisition of the drug.
Considering the cost-effectiveness data, it is surprising that none of the NOA-1 protocols has found
wider acceptance. Even more surprising, the 2 cytotoxic drugs VM26 and ara-C currently are not
approved for the treatment of glioma in Germany.
Application of ara-C was authorized only for the NOA1 study. The manufacturer of VM26, conversely, did
not ask for extension of approval of the product in
2006; rather, it was withdrawn completely from the
German market. VM26 still can be imported from
other European countries. However, it can be administered only to GB patients within an individual treatment decision but not as a general recommendation.
Whenever differences in survival and objective side
effects are small, large discrepancies in cost can be justified only by a significant improvement in subjective
quality-of-life (QoL) parameters. Internationally
accepted upper benchmarks for the cost per qualityadjusted life year are in the range from 40,000 to 45,000
Euros.13 The incremental cost of TMZ per qualityadjusted life year may be above this upper limit.12,14
The enormous costs of TMZ with hitherto undiscernable advantages compared with ACNU plus
VM26 suggest the need to start a direct comparison
of the 2 regimens in a new prospective, randomized,
phase 3 trial in patients with GB. According to Wolff
et al,11 it may be sufficient to compare TMZ with
ACNU only. Their survival gain analysis for various
nitrosoureas with or without additional drugs
revealed the highest survival gain for ACNU-based
treatments compared with 6 other nitrosoureas. In
addition, ACNU combination protocols did not result
in significantly higher effectiveness than treatment
with ACNU alone. Therefore, a direct comparison of
TMZ and ACNU may be worth consideration. The
finding that both drugs can be administered orally is
another asset of such an approach.
In contrast to the EORTC study, patients in the
NOA study were not stratified for MGMT methylation.15 However, the MGMT enzyme removes TMZ
residues as well as chloroethyl residues from O6-guanine in DNA. A recent Japanese study16 correlated
the expression of MGMT measured immunohisto-

chemically and the survival of patients with GB after
ACNU-based chemotherapy. Among only 18 patients
with GB, a trend was observed toward longer progression-free survival for patients who had low
MGMT-expressing tumors (15 months vs 9 months; P
¼ .09), and a statistically significant difference was
observed in overall survival (22 months vs 12
months; P ¼ .01). A second Japanese group that studied hypermethylation of the MGMT promoter
observed extended survival only for patients with AA,
but not for patients with GB, after ACNU treatment.17
Although the results were discrepant, these first data
indicate that it also may be worthwhile to consider
MGMT status for CENU-based chemotherapy. It is
noteworthy that hypermethylated MGMT gene status
did not appear to provide an additional benefit in
the recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) of the
EORTC patients in any of the RPA classes.3 A direct
comparison between TMZ and ACNU (with or
without VM26) in this respect also would be interesting. Finally, such a study should include full
assessment of QoL and overall cost. This would
make it possible to investigate whether the more
expensive treatment variant would be warranted
because of better QoL.
In conclusion, the treatment results from the
NOA-1 and EORTC 26981 trials appear to indicate
that ACNU plus VM26 (or ara-C) can be as effective
as TMZ for patients with GB but is much less costly.
Therefore, we suggest starting a direct comparison of
these successful regimens in a new prospective, randomized, phase 3 trial. Such a study should include
full assessment of QoL and overall costs to determine
whether the disproportionately higher drug costs for
TMZ are compensated by other costs or are justified
because of better QoL.
